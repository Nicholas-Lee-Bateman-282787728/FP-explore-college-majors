It has a delightful eerieness the entire way through and the casting is amazing.  The character of Bertha really creates fear and distrust in your heart along with Mr. Tuttle and Lydia.  The children were magnificently chosen and Nicole Kidman hasn't been this good since Dead Calm, if not better.  Turns out she is a very talented actress.  The dialogue in this is also cunning and brilliant.  One of the most interesting and amusing lines to me was when Kidman is looking through the &quot;dead photos&quot; and says to Ms. Mills...&quot;group portraits?&quot;.  The ending is so very clever, very eerie and it really does surprise you.  Not to mention, all throughout the movie, there are little heart in your throat moments.  Everyone keeps comparing it, but this is so much better than Sixth Sense. I think the mood and tone are much more like Village of the Damned with those spooky children.  Definitely recommend checking it out for yourself.

There wasn't any blood or disgusting stuff, but it did keep me scared on the edge of my seat, twitching every time I heard the suspenseful music start up again. With the music, you always knew when something would happen.The ending is creepy, but a lot of people thought it seemed kind of obvious and stupid. No matter. The cast does a good job in the atmospheric setting, which somehow makes it seem more real. Nicole Kidman gives one of her best performances as a religious and over-protective mother of two children who are hypersensitive to light. The children did a good job as well.Another factor adding to the creepy atmosphere was the house. They live in an old, large house that is the perfect setting. A lot of time was spent on set decoration for the house. It works, too, as their home seems more like a haunted house site than a place you'd want to live in.All in all, this is an excellent film with strong acting, cinematography, and production values.

One of my favourite movies of 2001, the Others is very interesting. It's a must-see. You won't be yawning as you watch it. This is definitely Nicole Kidman's best work yet. I didn't know she could act like this. It's a tense and a surprising story. It's not a complete copy of the sixth sense. It gives you a lot of detail and it has a fascinating plot. It's not a movie where you can easily guess what's happening. It's a great mystery that almost everyone would love. The chills and thrills it gives you makes it more suspenseful. It's some of 2001's best directed movies. It's a complete story (no major mistakes).It revolves around Kidman whose husband is off at war and she has to live with her two kids who're allergic to sunlight. Three workers than come into the story as Kidman's daughter reveals that she's been talking to a somebody who's very different from them. Is that somebody alive or dead? As these thoughts are being concentrated around kidman's head she begins to explore the house to find things she never knew were in the house.It's a great story.

544342,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CYLJ,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Once `The Sixth Sense' opened to major critical acclaim back in 1999 it seemed that there was a sudden rush of `ghost films' making their way to your local theater.  Some of them failed miserably to capitalize on what made `The Sixth Sense' so remarkable and groundbreaking.  And then there were a select few that just got it right.`The Others' is one of those few.Now, working off of my last review for `Planet of the Apes' where I showed a negative example of `suffering' through the same film twice in a row; I actually saw `The Others' in the theater twice in the same day as well.  Yes, I had a lot of time to kill back in 2001 (apparently).  I also worked in the mall, so when I got off work I moseyed over to the theater (right around the corner from the store I worked in) and picked a flick to watch.  After watching `The Others' I was moved to call my friends and recommend they see it.  I was lucky enough to accompany them.This movie still gives me shivers today.I think what makes `The Others' so compelling is the way it uses the genre clich&eacute;s to its benefit.  There is a lot going on here that is `standard' so-to-speak when you consider the genre, but this film manages to make it all work for it in a way that appears fresh and new to us.  The scares may be familiar (loud stomping in the dark) but this film pulls it off flawlessly.  The mood is beautifully set, with sets that are genuinely creepy without ever `trying to hard' to accomplish something.  The direction is sharp and the attention to detail is stellar here, actually building tension with every slipping frame.And then there is the acting.A lot of my friends consider Nicole Kidman's performance in `The Others' to actually be better than her Oscar nominated performance in `Moulin Rouge!'  It's hard for me to judge really, since they are so different, but truth be told that 2001 was a great year for Nicole.  She brilliantly captures the whole essence of this character, flawlessly exhibiting the right amount of chilled desolation needed to bring us into her shoes.  I also really enjoyed the young actors here, Alakina Mann and James Bentley.  They really understood the layers their characters needed to appear relatable and engaging.And Fionnula Flanagan is just brilliantly creepy.One thing I really LOVED about this film was the surprise ending that I NEVER SAW COMING.  There is a lot to be said about a twist ending that catches the viewer off guard without ever appearing to be forced or manipulated or preposterous.  This twist may even be better and more shocking than the one presented in `The Sixth Sense'!Just watch this movie; and then watch it again.",5,Excruciatingly haunting (I mean that in a good way)...,1275350400,"06 1, 2010",2010,2659,"['Once', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'opened', 'major', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'back', '1999', 'seemed', 'was', 'sudden', 'rush', 'ghost', 'films', 'making', 'way', 'local', 'theater', 'failed', 'miserably', 'capitalize', 'what', 'made', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'so', 'remarkable', 'groundbreaking', 'then', 'were', 'select', 'few', 'just', 'got', 'right.', 'Others', 'one', 'few.Now', 'working', 'last', 'review', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'where', 'showed', 'negative', 'example', 'suffering', 'same', 'film', 'twice', 'row', 'actually', 'saw', 'Others', 'theater', 'twice', 'same', 'day', 'well', 'Yes', 'had', 'lot', 'time', 'kill', 'back', '2001', 'apparently', 'also', 'worked', 'mall', 'when', 'got', 'off', 'work', 'moseyed', 'theater', 'right', 'corner', 'store', 'worked', 'picked', 'flick', 'watch', 'watching', 'Others', 'was', 'moved', 'call', 'friends', 'recommend', 'see', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'accompany', 'them.This', 'movie', 'still', 'shivers', 'today.I', 'think', 'what', 'Others', 'so', 'compelling', 'way', 'genre', 'clich', 'eacute', 'benefit', 'lot', 'going', 'here', 'standard', 'so-to-speak', 'when', 'consider', 'genre', 'film', 'make', 'work', 'way', 'fresh', 'new', 'scares', 'may', 'be', 'familiar', 'loud', 'stomping', 'dark', 'film', 'off', 'flawlessly', 'mood', 'beautifully', 'set', 'sets', 'are', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'ever', 'trying', 'hard', 'accomplish', 'something', 'direction', 'sharp', 'attention', 'detail', 'stellar', 'here', 'actually', 'building', 'tension', 'slipping', 'frame.And', 'then', 'acting.A', 'lot', 'friends', 'consider', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'performance', 'Others', 'actually', 'be', 'better', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'performance', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'hard', 'judge', 'really', 'are', 'so', 'different', 'truth', 'be', 'told', '2001', 'was', 'great', 'year', 'Nicole', 'brilliantly', 'whole', 'essence', 'character', 'flawlessly', 'exhibiting', 'right', 'amount', 'chilled', 'desolation', 'needed', 'bring', 'shoes', 'also', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'young', 'actors', 'here', 'Alakina', 'Mann', 'James', 'Bentley', 'really', 'understood', 'layers', 'characters', 'needed', 'appear', 'relatable', 'engaging.And', 'Fionnula', 'Flanagan', 'just', 'brilliantly', 'creepy.One', 'thing', 'really', 'LOVED', 'film', 'was', 'surprise', 'ending', 'NEVER', 'SAW', 'COMING', 'lot', 'be', 'said', 'twist', 'ending', 'viewer', 'off', 'guard', 'ever', 'appearing', 'be', 'forced', 'manipulated', 'preposterous', 'twist', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'better', 'more', 'shocking', 'one', 'presented', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Just', 'watch', 'movie', 'then', 'watch', 'again']",The Others

I saw this opening night, not knowing or having seen anything about the movie, going solely for Nicole Kidman and the positive buzz over it. I was not at all disappointed. From beginning to end, this movie will thrill you. It is chilling because of the masterful cinematography and expert acting, not just of Nicole Kidman, but of the cast of Brits, as well, especially the two remarkable children.

Wilson ""Atheen""","[5, 7]","I think that there's been so much hype over the Kidman-Cruise love-hate relationship over the years, that I haven't really been willing to give the actress her due professionally.  I bought The Others because I enjoy a good ghost story, and this one sounded pretty good from the descriptions I'd read of it.  Surprisingly I not only got the great ghost story I wanted, I got a new definition for Ms Kidman:  superb performer.  Her portrayal of a slightly unbalanced woman with an obsessive concern over the health and well being of her children was a jewel.  The diligent closing of curtains, the compulsive locking of doors behind her created a natural tension that built gradually as an apparently normal mother grew more and more dysfunctional before the viewer's eyes.  The slightly suspect servants who appear at her door in search of employment, after the woman's previous domestics had left without notice, heightens the sense of &quot;something's not quite right&quot; which builds to the denouement.Although not totally unpredictable, the movie is still a masterpiece of craftsmanship.  While The Sixth Sense, another film I liked, relied more substantially on CGI for its effect upon the viewer, The Others relies completely upon it's set, the progression of events, and the talent of its actors to create that sense of otherworldliness that makes a good story.Since the action occurs almost totally in the various rooms of an old house and to some extent on it's immediate grounds, the movie might make a good stage play, if it isn't one already.  As such it would certainly give ample opportunity for the set designer and the lighting and sound managers to give vent to their creativity.  I'd certainly look forward to such a production.

I think everyone knows it's a ghost story. The movie stars Nicole Kidman who's the mother of two children, a boy and a girl. They have a huge manor in the English country side. Now I stop. If I tell you anymore I'll give it away. The family has some visitors, and it gets very chilling. This is an excellent representation of a haunting. If you've ever heard any ghost stories or seen ghost movies, the hauntings get rather unbelievable. This one will have you checking under your bed at night. Both my boyfriend and I jumped and screamed aloud a couple of times. If you don't scream, you'll at least jump. It'll have your blood pumping and on edge the whole way. If you like suspense you'll love this movie. It's a great date movie, if you want your girl to cling to your arm, and it's all around fun.For the children, I'd say it's a very clean movie. It's not gory at all, but it is scary. If your children get nightmares from movies I wouldn't take them, but if they like scary movies, by all means, bring them to this one. It's an adult kind of scary in that it makes you think and it's not just some ghost running around with a meat cleaver chopping heads off. If you want that there are plenty of cheap thrillers in the local video store. This one will have your spine crawling instead. This is for anyone who has sat up in bed at night to a thump and wondered what it was, or thought that just maybe they saw something move that shouldn't have. It's subtle, but that's why it's so good.I'd be very careful about letting anyone tell you the plot of the movie, just go see it.

Apparently, they are extremely sensitive to light.  (The curtains must be drawn at all times.)  It is 1945 on a British isle, the husband is off to war, and Kidman is trying to hire three new housekeepers.  Three arrive, with an apparent knowledge of the house's past.  Then strange things begin to happen...'The Others' is one of the best-looking films I have seen in a long time.  A lot of painstaking detail was put into the house itself.  It looks and feels authentic and creepy.  The acting is very, very good.  (The children are surprisingly good.)  The scares and chills of the film are not the same scares and chills you would experience from your average horror film.  This film is way above that.  With so many things going for it, though, you wonder why the ending is so weak.  I won't give away the ending, but I will say that if you watch (and not even very carefully), you won't be surprised, but you WILL be disappointed.  The first 90 minutes sets up a wonderful promise, but the last 15 minutes refuses to deliver on that promise.  Why four stars if I didn't like the ending?  Because the first 90 minutes are so beautifully done, you can ALMOST forgive the ending.

Eerie, suspenseful, emotionally involving, gorgeous to behold, and some of the most memorable ghosts ever. It includes the great elements of any classic gothic thriller: a large isolated old manor enveloped by an ominous blanket of fog, suspicious servants, a rather peculiar owner of the house, strange noises and unexplainable events, and an atmosphere that just reeks of doom and gloom. But the story and the characters make this a cut way above the usual and a tremendously rewarding movie watching experience.The film kicks off with a mystery and the tension subtly grows from there. Three people show-up on the doorstep for employment before the Missus of the household had a chance to place an advertisement. hmmm...... As the new servants, they must learn all the rules of the house which include always insuring that they shut and lock each door behind them and never ever allowing even a smidgen of sunlight to sneak in from behind the heavy drapes of each room.  The house is also occupied by two small children who are vigilantly watched over by their firm and no-nonsense mother. Seems the little ones suffer from some strange rare disorder. hmmm.... Tension mounts as doors are left open (it wasn't the help - they swear it wasn`t), noises echo from empty rooms, the kids talk to invisible people, those sneaky servants cover up some graves they discover on the property, and a former member of the household returns only to quickly disappear.I was pleasantly surprised by Nicole Kidman as the uptight mom. She gives an exquisitely layered performance of a woman rigid on the outside but terrified and lonely within. Her character is the heart and soul of this movie and Miss Kidman is impeccable.Don't expect any splashy special effects, objects hurling threw the air and attacking people, or gruesome beasties running amuck.

544362,ALR35EFI69S5R,B00003CYLJ,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[11, 13]","This film wildly illustrates what an incredible mastery of filmmaking a relatively new director like Alejandro Amenabar brings to bear on each of his productions.  Previously known as the director for the provocative and memorable Spanish precursor to Tom Cruise's recent film ""Vanilla Sky"", here Amenabar seams together a perfectly concocted blend of sight, sound and sensation to delight and chill us in ""The Others"".  He's aided and abetted in this marvelous cinematic effort by the superb acting of Nicole Kidmann in a no-holds-barred performance, as well as by a terrific supporting cast of relative unknowns. In addition, everything from the cinematography (that is, the way the director chooses to use the camera to further the mood and affect of the story) and the soundtrack music are all contributing elements in a  tour-de-force effort that drags us along breathlessly as the awe-striking plot winds toward its date with destiny.The outlines of the basic story is seemingly simple and straight-forward, but in matter of fact is full of subtle aspects that subsequently serve to powerfully affect the direction and spin of the events that suddenly and mysteriously begin to malevolently transpire. All of it is believable, due in large part to the work of Kidmann as well as the way in which the director uses every aspect of his craft to set the dark, somber and threatening mood piece we need to work the story toward its conclusion.  His use of music to add to the suspense is unusually adroit, and when we realize he has also composed the score being used, we begin to understand the degree to which his range of talents extends.This is a wonderful movie, one that employs all of the basics of terrific film making extremely well, and one which takes an ostensibly simple idea and then plays with it artfully to stretch our minds and the range of possibilities out before us in a tantalizing and yet horrifying way.

544363,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00003CYLJ,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[7, 7]","First off, I'm gonna just go right ahead and tell you that this movie was the best thriller I have seen in a very long, long, long time. They don't make them like this anymore. What a shame. We need more scary thrillers like this. Writer/director AlejandroAmenabar really delivers the goods. The fantastic Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a rather cold, icey mother of two who lives in a large and spooky mansion circa 1945. She has hired three new servants to help in her home after her previous employees just vanished. Just left. Her children, Anne and Nicholas, suffer from a rare disease that makes them break out in blisters and suffocate if they come in contact with light. Because of this, the house curtains are pulled and the place is usually in the dark. Spooky. The little girl believes the place is haunted when she keeps seeing people. Her mother and brother refuse to hear it. Strange things begin to happen and they only get more and more odd until Grace is forced to believe her daughter. The movie is great. Nicole Kidman gives the best performance of her career. She is no longer ""Mrs. Tom Cruise"" and this movie proves it. Anyone who thinks otherwise, is clearly wrong. She was nominated for an Oscar for ""Moulin Rouge"", but she deserved it more for this performance. The acting and accent are dead on perfect. The kids are great. We don't see such great kid actors too often, but these two were very good. I could listen to their accents all day. The movie looks really good and is shot magnificently. A gorgeous looking movie. It's full of interesting plot turns that ends in a surprise climax that beats the hell out of the ending of ""The Sixth Sense"". The one star review below is ridiculous beyond belief. The house and fog are shot incredibly. The atmosphere of this film is just as important and thrilling as the actors and the action. The music is superb as well. This movie, along with Alejandro's superb direction and storytelling, tells you that you can have a truly epic, scary, mysterious, and overall satisfying movie experience with the things that you don't see, as much as the other movies filled with make-up, special effects, and CGI computer generated effects. The best kind of thriller are the ones about true fear that make you create it in your own mind. Not spoon fed to you by eye popping Hollywood tricks and camera trickery. All you need is a solid story and good actors. This movie has those things and then some. Superbly done folks. If you like a good haunted house movie, this one is the best in eons. As I've already said before, this is the best thriller I've seen in many a moon. The people who didn't get it are laughable. This movie is wasted on them. I suggest they go back to watching ""Temptation Island"". Make yourself a bowl of popcorn, get comfy on the couch, turn off the lights, and get ready for an immensley enjoyable thriller. This is a good movie.",4,"Chilling, Spine Tingling Thriller",1021593600,"05 17, 2002",2002,2911,"['First', ""'m"", 'gon', 'na', 'just', 'go', 'right', 'ahead', 'tell', 'movie', 'was', 'best', 'thriller', 'have', 'seen', 'very', 'long', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'anymore', 'What', 'shame', 'need', 'more', 'scary', 'thrillers', 'Writer/director', 'AlejandroAmenabar', 'really', 'goods', 'fantastic', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Grace', 'rather', 'cold', 'icey', 'mother', 'two', 'who', 'large', 'spooky', 'mansion', 'circa', '1945', 'hired', 'three', 'new', 'servants', 'help', 'home', 'previous', 'employees', 'just', 'vanished', 'Just', 'left', 'children', 'Anne', 'Nicholas', 'suffer', 'rare', 'disease', 'break', 'out', 'blisters', 'suffocate', 'come', 'contact', 'light', 'house', 'curtains', 'are', 'pulled', 'place', 'usually', 'dark', 'Spooky', 'little', 'girl', 'place', 'haunted', 'when', 'seeing', 'people', 'mother', 'brother', 'refuse', 'hear', 'Strange', 'things', 'begin', 'happen', 'only', 'get', 'more', 'more', 'odd', 'Grace', 'forced', 'believe', 'daughter', 'movie', 'great', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'no', 'longer', 'Mrs.', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'movie', 'Anyone', 'who', 'otherwise', 'clearly', 'wrong', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'deserved', 'more', 'performance', 'acting', 'accent', 'are', 'dead', 'perfect', 'kids', 'are', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'such', 'great', 'kid', 'actors', 'too', 'often', 'two', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'could', 'listen', 'accents', 'day', 'movie', 'really', 'good', 'shot', 'magnificently', 'gorgeous', 'looking', 'movie', 'full', 'interesting', 'plot', 'surprise', 'climax', 'hell', 'ending', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'one', 'star', 'review', 'ridiculous', 'belief', 'house', 'fog', 'are', 'shot', 'incredibly', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'just', 'important', 'thrilling', 'actors', 'action', 'music', 'superb', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'Alejandro', 'superb', 'direction', 'storytelling', 'can', 'have', 'truly', 'epic', 'scary', 'mysterious', 'overall', 'satisfying', 'movie', 'experience', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'movies', 'filled', 'make-up', 'special', 'effects', 'CGI', 'computer', 'generated', 'effects', 'best', 'kind', 'thriller', 'are', 'ones', 'true', 'fear', 'make', 'create', 'own', 'mind', 'Not', 'spoon', 'fed', 'eye', 'popping', 'Hollywood', 'tricks', 'camera', 'trickery', 'need', 'solid', 'story', 'good', 'actors', 'movie', 'things', 'then', 'Superbly', 'done', 'folks', 'like', 'good', 'haunted', 'house', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'eons', ""'ve"", 'already', 'said', 'best', 'thriller', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'moon', 'people', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'are', 'laughable', 'movie', 'wasted', 'suggest', 'go', 'back', 'watching', 'Temptation', 'Island', 'Make', 'bowl', 'popcorn', 'get', 'comfy', 'couch', 'turn', 'off', 'lights', 'get', 'ready', 'immensley', 'enjoyable', 'thriller', 'good', 'movie']",The Others
544364,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B00003CYLJ,barry,"[5, 5]","THE OTHERS is a classic film.  It is superbly written, directed and most importantly acted.  Nicole Kidman radiates in one of her finest performances and carries this film on her shoulders from beginning to end.  And this film has no gimmicks or over the top special effects.  It is a true ghost story and a very intelligent one at that.  If you are reading this you are probably already a fan of the film.  But how is it on blu ray.  Blu ray when used correctly can highly raise the bar of presentation on a film.  One would assume THE OTHERS might present a challenge for it is a dark film shot mostly in shadows and fog.  But the video presentation on the blu ray here does an amazing job.  The present graininess is original to the film and the atmospeheric fog and shadows take on new life while characters appear clearly throughout. Characters and scenery show through strong and clear with very strong clarity and crispness and skin tones are very realistic.  Colors are otherwise subdued for they are meant to be but the whole picture manages to shine levels above the dvd.  With this superb video we get an even better audio presentation.  The DTS HD Master 5.1 audio is superb.  This is mostly a dialogue driven film but there is beautiful soundtrack music and this is indeed a ghost story.  And what we get is very strong and present dialogue with surround sounds that come to dynamic life with the scares and chills and thrills.  This is indeed a haunting film and the audio presentation puts blu ray to great use.  Your whole speaker system will come to life and have you jumping out of your skin at all the right places.This classic film gets the treatment it deserves on blu ray.  THE OTHERS is a film so intricate and detailed that multiple viewings will strongly be desired and the blu ray presentation will make each viewing that much better.  Every excellent thing about this film is made that much better on blu ray.  I highly recommend this film.  And if you already own the dvd give yourself a treat and get the blu ray.

Nicole Kidman gives a brilliantly mannered performance as a woman waiting for her husband to come home from the Second World War in a large, gloomy manor on the British island of Jersey. Her two children, who are both allergic to natural light to a near-lethal degree, insist they're hearing things go bump in the night during their long hours of playing by candlelight. Nonsense, says their mother, and off you go before you give me another migraine. Soon come three new servants who may have more than their share of answers as to what's really going on in the spooky old house. Audiences will definately compare the ""I See Dead People"" thematics of this film to The Sixth Sense, and there are many similarities to compare, but this film takes more of its inspiration from British gothic horror movies of yesteryear (most notably Jack Clayton's 1961 The Innocents, adapted from Henry James' novel The Turn of The Screw). Fionnula Flanagan matches Kidman's brilliant performance with a real presence as the new housekeeper of the manor, and the two youngsters playing Kidman's children are unbelievably charismatic.

I waited for this one to come out on DVD because I feared a ... pour acting job by Nicole Kidman. But I have come to the conclusion, after much debate, that her performance isn't what ruined this moive. It was probably terrible before the first bits of celluloid were warmed up. There are two general types of mystery plots 1) in which the author carefully constructs a set of clues that when followed lead to a logical conclusion 2)the author provides random clues and a metaphysical (or impossible to construct from the clues) conclusion is invented to make the story appear deep and well constructed. Under the hands of a great artist the second type of mystery can actually be entertaining. But ""The Others"" reminded me more of short story contest winners written by friends when I was in 6th grade.

It has a chilling ending and leaves you hoping shes forgiven.  I thought the movie was tragic ghost story that has the dramtic depth and character that THE SIXTH SENSE had, this ending much more sad and the movie is much more elegant and wonderfully directed and stylized film- which ranks it over THE SIXTH SENSE(8/10), which I loved too.  Definitely 9/10 or ***1/2.  Go watch this symbolicly textured film  (which can be taken in many different ways), or watch it for the beautiful Nicole Kidman, or to watch a classic ghost story thats SCARY!  Nicole Kidman did a wonderful job portraying a character who needs such a wide range of emotions.  The children are believable and the supporting cast is solid.  Nicole Kidman is let to show her acting talent with a tormented character who gets your sympathy and then throws at you her secret that you hope shes forgiven for.  The drama depth and symbolism is used wonderfully here.  She truly loves her children- but the loss of her husband, her isolation, and her childrens sickness drives her to the edge.  She is a deeply religious woman- where does she think she is?  She truly loves her children and it is a tragedy to see everything shes gone through with the loss of her husband.  Its scary as well and has the classic fog-ladden house and creepy bumps in the night.  It is stylishly directed and every action scene is directed with such intensity (I loved the scene in which the the children wake up in the morning to discover- well, if you watched it, you should know).  It reaches back into the classic horror stories of THE INNOCENTS and THE HAUNTING, who share a great deal with this film: the power and haunting and emotional depth as this film.  I loved this movie and it is one of my favorites.  It ranks with some of the best horror films and, besides all the script and deepness stuff, its a great thriller with some delightfully jump out of your seat moments and freaky scenes.  The little kids are adorable and it is delightfully creepy.  Watch, enjoy, and even tear up in this tragic story with character for the quality people, horror for the thrills.

And I loved how it twisted mine around and threw it back in my face.The story revolves around a young lady (Nicole Kidman) and her two children who live in a home off the England coast.  Her husband is away fighting in WWII, leaving Nicole and her kids alone in a Gothic home with the ambience of Dracula's summer home.  Add to this the medical condition of Xeroderma Pigmentosum (allergy to light) that the children have, and it makes for some dark scenes that keep you gripping your seat or loved one's hand with excessive force.Enter Fionnula Flanagan (a house maid/nanny)--- who brings along two other caretakers.  She has a dusky presence that sits uneasily with you the moment she's seen on screen.  As are her two 'assistants' (one of whom is a mute for unknown reasons... in the beginning).The house begins to take on a personality of its own soon after the arrival of these new servants. The children begin seeing strange people, whom Nicole can't visualize for some reason.  Bumps, creaks, mysterious piano concertos, slamming doors and a curious constant fog all add to an eerie sense that all is rotten in Denmark (or Jersey?).The last fifteen minutes of the film will make you breath a sigh of...what?  Relief?  Emotional exhaustion?  A gasping understanding?  Thankful that you can finally pee normally again?

544409,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,B00003CYLJ,C. Middleton,"[2, 2]","This film has all the essential qualities of a classic ghost story. It really comes down to the fact that if a ghost story is told well, it will scare you. ~The Others~ is extremely well made, each scene is crafted to ensure it evokes a particular mood or feeling in the most subtle ways. Director Alejandro Amenaber, (Open your Eyes) is a Spanish craftsman who has a gift for telling a story with subtlety, nothing is ever apparent, but is hinted at through the visuals and clues in the dialogue. Personally, the in-your-face horror stories do nothing for me. I find Eddie Krugger, for example, hilarious. What is horrifying, for me, is subtle irrational behaviour. Grace (Nicole Kidman) at the opening of the film instructs the servants to ensure they close and lock every door in the house as they move through them. As she believes the sunlight is dangerous to her two children, she is absolutely adamant that the light must be contained. Suddenly our normal sensibilities are reversed, the light is the enemy and the darkness must be secured at any cost. I find this sort of thing more disturbing than 'Jason' rising from the depths and decapitating a few unlucky teenagers. Subtlety is the key for a good ghost story.Nicole Kidman is a versatile actor who possesses a huge range. She has shown that she can play just about any character and play it with believability. In this film her neurotic behaviour is honest to the point of irritability. She is also an attractive and elegant woman and a pleasure to view on the big screen. Her performance in this film is quite good, but Fionnula Flanagan as the head housekeeper stole the show. Her expressions throughout the film would constantly put me off balance - the characters intentions are never clear until the end. She plays a veneer of kindness with a hint of evil bubbling just under the surface. Again, this was a subtle performance which created a huge impact. In fact, all the performances from the cast, particularly the children, were first rate.This is a good film to have in your collection because it can be seen more than once, as there are subtle aspects in the story that will be missed on a single viewing.

There is nothing I love more than coming up on someone who has never seen the film and watching them try to figure it out- and no one ever does, even those who have seen such twisty thrillers as ""The Sixth Sense"" (which by the way, hasn't aged nearly as well as this one).

I was kind of expecting one of those stupid special-effects focused horror movies that would be pretty retarded overall, but this turned out to be an exceptionally creepy movie.  There were virtually no amazing visual effects in it, because they weren't neccessary fot the movie.  Based on the old gothic horror story ""The Turn of the Screw"" by Henry James, the movie is about a mother of two children who hires some new servants at her mansion, and the children begin to see strange, eerie things that are made creepy not by what you see but by what you simply hear.  The simple sounds of footsteps thumping upstairs and the sillhouettes of small children at night make the film very genuinely freaky, and this movie is built more on psychological horror than anything else.

544414,A2PNE83C7C8FC,B00003CYLJ,"Daniel A. Fincke ""thegreatfandincke""","[0, 1]","What an amazing actress Nicole Kidman is. I was a skeptic at first, thinking her celebrity was undeserved and only borrowed from her husband's name, but wow, film after film she has proved not only a marvelous actress but to be about as good a judge of projects worth being involved with as Mr. Cruise is, which, to me, is saying quite a bit. This film is no exception, her performance is riveting and propels the film the entire way. Her face alone is captivatingly expressive, emotional and intense. She is not alone either, the children and the servants are also played to perfection. They all contribute to the amazingly creepy atmosphere that Amenabar creates with his visuals and even with his self-written score. This film is about atmosphere and it is criticized for having little more. It is also about what is revealed in the end and for that being too little too late. To these protestations I want to respond. I must admit that I did feel a bit of a letdown in the end myself and despite a series of perfectly scary sequences leading up to it, the end makes the film feel on one level like scary build ups for the sake of scary build ups. The end can be (and has been) accused of being a twist for the sake of a twist or merely an exercise in unfairly withholding information from the audience. The movie can also be accused of being all atmosphere but with no substance. I disagree with all these charges but not because I don't see where they come from. This movie rests on its twist because unlike the Sixth Sense this movie makes you wait for the twist to feel like you know anything about what is going on. In the Sixth Sense you think you've understood the movie alright and that you've had plot development and resolution and that the sense of oddity to the whole thing can be chalked up just to tone of direction when suddenly you are shocked with a revelation into the real source of the strange mood and the true insight into what all of what you have seen and thought you understood was. This film does not temporarily appease you and so it leaves you dying to finally get the key to the film. With that level of anticipation the movie has trouble living up to the Sixth Sense's ambush surprise satisfaction rate. What is even worse for The Others is that it comes after The Sixth Sense and Fight Club and What Lies Beneath, and The Usual Suspects have prepared us for the mislead-the-audience brand of thriller that is not a mystery but a rather an audience participation demonstration in the relativities of perception. Since we've seen such a thing before, this film shocks us less and gives little meantime satisfaction so all we can concentrate on is the big shock coming. With those expectations, even if it is still surprising, it is in a way too predictable. So, I get the critique and think I see why it comes into play. I stand by the movie though because I think that this film is actually in the end, sharper than the Sixth Sense for its way of sticking to a very classic haunted house premise and working so successfully to put a new spin on such an old genre, its ability to stay extremely spooky in such a well known context, to invert our expectations right where we have the most expectations rather than creating a new realm of circumstances for the characters so that the audience is scared just from the confusion of trying to acclamate to its new world (as was the case in the Sixth Sense.) This movie puts us in a very predictable setting and yet scares us. I think that the film is really about watching it the second time. The Sixth Sense was disappointing the second time, once the joke was gotten going through the motions of watching it was unnecessary. The film was not ABOUT what it is like to live in a certain perception, primarily. Whereas I think this film is really about what it is like to be in that haunted house from the perspective of Kidman and her children and experiencing it knowing what they are really going through seems to me to be a fascinating twist worth watching reenacted repeatedly. It is like a visual work of art that way more than it is a narrative. The Sixth Sense was about the art of narrative more. This is about the portrait, the art of getting there, the every moment more than the grand finale. The better films sometimes are like that, they are not about big payoffs, and this film despite the obvious importance of the ending twists is not really one long set up to a twist. The twist is an element, a section of a larger work of beauty. It is rewatchable just for the visual picture of a way of being. Truman Show is much the same way, yet even better, for the care and beauty that goes into every moment, in which the end is only a glorious part of something sublime throughout. This is no Truman Show, some of the film does drag, and there are a handful of nice set ups that get wasted and a little bit of being creepy just for the sake of being creepy, but overall this is a movie that works even though it fails to be as climactic as a film usually needs to be. Occasionally at least, a film can be judged by criteria more similar to applied to static visual art and I think this one fairs proudly by such a standard.",4,Ceaselessly Creepy,998438400,"08 22,

Sadly, this plot was entirely predictable, and the movie in and of itself came off as being somewhat unlikable. Nicole Kidman and her child costars seemed quite whinny to me, and I didn't particularly care for them. I liked the servants though. There was quite a bit of cleaver cinematography, but those of us who learned the artistic clues from the Sixth Sense were able to pick up on what was going on very early into the movie. Some one was a ghost... and it wasn't the ""others"" living in the house. At first I knew that the servants were ghosts. That much was obvious, then, halfway into the film I figured out that Nicole Kidman's character and her kids were also dead. In a very Sixth Sense manner this twist ending that I predicted halfway into the movie came about. It is the sort of ending that only works on seasoned horror fans once. I would have liked the movie better had the ""others"" been the ghosts, and this had been a more traditional ghost film. The problem with twist endings is keeping them fresh and unique. An ending can make or break a film, and in this case its ""I want to be the sixth sense"" ""I saw that one coming"" ending ruined it for me. But I am pretty hard to please when it comes to horror films.To its credits it did have a couple of good scares, but this was not enough to save it from its over all mediocre ""me too"" plot. The Others is a cheap attempt to mimic the dark magic and genius of M. Night Shayman's masterpiece ""the Sixth Sense."" Nothing more. What is really sad is that this movie could have been a brilliant spook show if it had lead you to believe that the mother and kids were dead, only to reveal that they were indeed alive and slipping into the precious of madness, like in Eternal darkness. Since no one in Hollywood has thought of it, and I just did, I hereby copyright that idea.

Hamlow,"[0, 0]","On the isle of Jersey in 1945, Grace and two children, Anne and Nicholas, live in a large darkly-lit estate by themselves, the husband/father having gone out to fight the Germans.  Three servants appear at the door in response to an ad.  They are two elderly people, Ms. Mills and Mr. Tuttle, and a young mute named Lydia.  Grace, grateful for the help, accepts their services.  A severe young lady wearing dark clothes, she is very religious, demanding, and narrow in the view that she is always right.  For example, not only is she a stickler for her two children in learning their religious lessons, but she makes it clear in no uncertain terms that Ms. Mills must close every door that is immediately opened and to leave the curtains closed, as her children are photosensitive.Of the children, the older Anne has begun to question the religious programming instilled by their mother.  As she points out, wouldn't it have been better for the Christian children in their lesson to deny Jesus before the Romans but still secretly believe in him so they wouldn't be executed?  She is also headstrong, insisting that there was a boy named Victor who was crying, and despite being punished by her mother for lying, refuses to acknowledge she's in the wrong.  She also tells Ms. Mills that when the old servants left, &quot;Mummy went mad&quot;, something that Nicholas insistently refutes.The one scene where it's clear something's going on is when Grace attributes a series of noisy thumps to Lydia.  She is annoyed when the chandelier above her rattles and is about to tell her off when she sees to her surprise, through the window, Ms. Mills talking to Lydia in the garden.  It then becomes clear that there are intruders in the house, intruders that cannot be seen, intruders who leave lights on, enter rooms, and even play the piano.  Ghosts?Alejandro Amenabar, best known for the snuff-film thriller Tesis and the mystery thriller Abre Los Ojos, chalks up another winner his in his U.S. directorial debut, effectively creating an eerie haunted house thriller.  Like his other two movies, the tension grows and tightens bit by bit, to a frantic pace during the movie's last half hour, ratcheted by eyebrow raising scenes and discoveries.  The near-dark setting in the house adds to the gothic aura, as does the music he composed for the movie.Nicole Kidman (Grace) should've been nominated for a Best Actress award for this movie, not Moulin Rouge.  She does an effective portrayal of a woman whose tried and true beliefs are slowly challenged until they fall crumbling to the ground, driving her sanity to the brink.  Fionnula Flannigan plays Ms. Mills as a kindly grandmother-type, an anchor of dignified strength and pillar of support, someone the children find easy to talk to.  And both children give credible performances, especially Alakina Mann (Anne).The finale is one of those last-minute twists that will make one think back to certain points in the movie and think, &quot;OHO, so that's what that was about.&quot;  Definitely one of the best movies of 2001",5,Gripping suspense thriller is one of 2001's best,1042070400,"01 9, 2003",2003,3071,"['isle', 'Jersey', '1945', 'Grace', 'two', 'children', 'Anne', 'Nicholas', 'live', 'large', 'darkly-lit', 'estate', 'husband/father', 'having', 'gone', 'out', 'fight', 'Germans', 'Three', 'servants', 'appear', 'door', 'response', 'ad', 'are', 'two', 'elderly', 'people', 'Ms.', 'Mills', 'Mr.', 'Tuttle', 'young', 'mute', 'named', 'Lydia', 'Grace', 'grateful', 'help', 'accepts', 'services', 'severe', 'young', 'lady', 'wearing', 'dark', 'clothes', 'very', 'religious', 'demanding', 'narrow', 'view', 'always', 'right', 'example', 'not', 'only', 'stickler', 'two', 'children', 'learning', 'religious', 'lessons', 'clear', 'uncertain', 'terms', 'Ms.', 'Mills', 'must', 'close', 'door', 'immediately', 'opened', 'leave', 'curtains', 'closed', 'children', 'are', 'children', 'older', 'Anne', 'begun', 'question', 'religious', 'programming', 'instilled', 'mother', 'out', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Christian', 'children', 'lesson', 'deny', 'Jesus', 'Romans', 'still', 'secretly', 'believe', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'executed', 'also', 'headstrong', 'insisting', 'was', 'boy', 'named', 'Victor', 'who', 'was', 'crying', 'being', 'punished', 'mother', 'lying', 'acknowledge', 'wrong', 'also', 'Ms.', 'Mills', 'when', 'old', 'servants', 'left', 'quot', 'Mummy', 'went', 'mad', 'quot', 'something', 'Nicholas', 'insistently', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'clear', 'something', 'going', 'when', 'Grace', 'series', 'noisy', 'thumps', 'Lydia', 'annoyed', 'when', 'chandelier', 'rattles', 'about', 'tell', 'off', 'when', 'surprise', 'window', 'Ms.', 'Mills', 'talking', 'Lydia', 'garden', 'then', 'clear', 'are', 'intruders', 'house', 'intruders', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'intruders', 'who', 'leave', 'lights', 'enter', 'rooms', 'even', 'play', 'piano', 'Ghosts', 'Alejandro', 'Amenabar', 'best', 'known', 'snuff-film', 'thriller', 'Tesis', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'Abre', 'Los', 'Ojos', 'up', 'winner', 'U.S.', 'directorial', 'debut', 'effectively', 'creating', 'eerie', 'haunted', 'house', 'thriller', 'other', 'two', 'movies', 'tension', 'grows', 'tightens', 'bit', 'bit', 'frantic', 'pace', 'movie', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'ratcheted', 'eyebrow', 'raising', 'scenes', 'discoveries', 'near-dark', 'setting', 'house', 'gothic', 'aura', 'music', 'composed', 'movie.Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Grace', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actress', 'award', 'movie', 'not', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'effective', 'portrayal', 'woman', 'tried', 'true', 'beliefs', 'are', 'slowly', 'challenged', 'fall', 'crumbling', 'ground', 'driving', 'sanity', 'brink', 'Fionnula', 'Flannigan', 'Ms.', 'Mills', 'kindly', 'grandmother-type', 'anchor', 'dignified', 'strength', 'pillar', 'support', 'someone', 'children', 'find', 'easy', 'talk', 'children', 'give', 'credible', 'performances', 'especially', 'Alakina', 'Mann', 'Anne', '.The', 'finale', 'one', 'last-minute', 'twists', 'will', 'make', 'one', 'think', 'back', 'certain', 'points', 'movie', 'think', 'quot', 'OHO', 'what', 'was', 'about.', 'quot', 'Definitely', 'one', 'best', 'movies', '2001']",The Others
544419,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00003CYLJ,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[4, 4]","The Others is an absolutely incredible movie.  Only too rarely does a movie come along that can absolutely stun you all at once with its implications.  The ending of this movie absolutely caught me unawares, and in one single instant, before the movie even told me what was happening, a blow of shocking revelation hit me right in the stomach.  Few movies deliver a personal epiphany to the viewer, but The Others does just that.  I cannot point to any part of the film that was not perfectly done.  Nicole Kidman gives her best performance ever, carrying the audience along with her character's pain and confusion.  The children plays their roles remarkably well, with all the subtlety and believability required to make this movie succeed as a psychological masterpiece.  The three servants were magnificent, although I did not appreciate the true greatness of their performance until the end.  The house itself is very much a character in the movie, and the darkness, gloominess, and vulnerability it projects into every scene is palpable.  There are surely great challenges to directing a movie with such an atmosphere and darkness and isolation, but not only did a twenty-eight year old Alejandro Amenabar direct a masterpiece, he also wrote the screenplay and composed the musical score.  The music, without a doubt, greatly magnifies the effects of the increasingly tense, otherworldly atmosphere.This movie was quite different from what I expected from the trailers I had seen.  It definitely has the power to frighten and unnerve its audience, but this is so much more than just some kind of psychological horror.  Anyone passing the movie by as just another haunted house story is robbing  himself/herself of a great experience.  The DVD package contains a number of extra features on a second disc, and the supporting material does add depth and meaning to the movie's themes.  Along with a look at the making of the movie, there is a feature on the rare disease the children in the film suffer from, an affliction so rare that there is very little awareness of it among the public.  The only thing missing is an audio commentary of the movie by the director and/or actors.This is really one of the best motion pictures I have ever seen and truly deserving of the critical acclaim it has garnered.  The ending really hits you like a ton of bricks.

544420,A27CFNHYZG6WS8,B00003CYLJ,darragh o'donoghue,"[2, 3]","'the Others' is the best Hollywood movie of the year, a genuinely spooky ghost story; that rare thing in this age of high concepts, preview audiences, market research and CGI effects, a film that is all about plot, that uses plot to reveal (and conceal) character, that uses the consoling properties of plot (explanation, resolution, reconciliation) to create further ambiguities and mysteries.in its story of a woman who may or may not be seeing ghosts; of seemingly malevolent servants; of innocent children in danger of corruption; the film has been compared to Henry James' 'The Turn of the Screw', the scariest book ever written.  it shares with that tale a slow-burning, nerve-fraying suspense narrative; a vividly atmospheric locale (in this case a remote manor on a remote English island further removed from Britain having been occupied by the Germans) and a mood of barely suppressed panic.  Working in a popular medium under a studio system, director Amenebar cannot follow James into completely terrifying irresolution, but there are sequences where the tension goes beyond the confines of narrative into the truly uncanny, such as the scene where Kidman leaves the house at the pitch of the action, walks down a cold and forlorn wooded lane, the first time we have been out of the estate's confines, and is soon lost in fog.Amenebar is a Spaniard and has taken a predominantly Protestant genre - the haunted house story - with its pseudo-rationalist basis in psychological or allegorical crises, and infused it with a very scary Catholic mythology, such as Hell and Limbo, the idea of being dead but unrested forever; the idea of photosensitive children forced to live like moles in endless night.  The film is full of brilliantly low-key nuances rarely spoken about in British cinema or culture - the one German invasion in British soil (with Kidman's possible collusion resonating throughout); the destruction of the family by the patriotic need to go to war; the trauma of a single mother in a culture that demeans them.There is a strange disjunction between the very Victorian atmosphere, with its lack of modern technology, its outmoded clothes, its formal way of speech, its obsessions with ghosts and cemetaries, its gruesome photo albums of the dead (which, it was hoped, would keep alive the deceased spirit) and the nominal setting, 1945, which, though an age away, seems so much more familiar and modern to us.",4,"A spare, simple film full of endless enigmas.",1005523200,"11 12, 2001",2001,2434,"['Others', 'best', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'year', 'genuinely', 'spooky', 'ghost', 'story', 'rare', 'thing', 'age', 'high', 'concepts', 'preview', 'audiences', 'market', 'research', 'CGI', 'effects', 'film', 'plot', 'plot', 'reveal', 'conceal', 'character', 'consoling', 'properties', 'plot', 'explanation', 'resolution', 'reconciliation', 'create', 'further', 'ambiguities', 'mysteries.in', 'story', 'woman', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'seeing', 'ghosts', 'seemingly', 'malevolent', 'servants', 'innocent', 'children', 'danger', 'corruption', 'film', 'been', 'compared', 'Henry', 'James', 'Turn', 'Screw', 'scariest', 'book', 'ever', 'written', 'shares', 'slow-burning', 'nerve-fraying', 'suspense', 'narrative', 'vividly', 'atmospheric', 'locale', 'case', 'remote', 'manor', 'remote', 'English', 'island', 'further', 'removed', 'Britain', 'having', 'been', 'occupied', 'Germans', 'mood', 'barely', 'suppressed', 'panic', 'Working', 'popular', 'medium', 'studio', 'system', 'director', 'Amenebar', 'can', 'not', 'follow', 'James', 'completely', 'terrifying', 'irresolution', 'are', 'sequences', 'where', 'tension', 'confines', 'narrative', 'truly', 'uncanny', 'such', 'scene', 'where', 'Kidman', 'house', 'pitch', 'action', 'walks', 'down', 'cold', 'forlorn', 'wooded', 'lane', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'been', 'estate', 'confines', 'soon', 'lost', 'fog.Amenebar', 'Spaniard', 'taken', 'predominantly', 'Protestant', 'genre', 'haunted', 'house', 'story', 'pseudo-rationalist', 'basis', 'psychological', 'allegorical', 'crises', 'infused', 'very', 'scary', 'Catholic', 'mythology', 'such', 'Hell', 'Limbo', 'idea', 'being', 'dead', 'unrested', 'forever', 'idea', 'photosensitive', 'children', 'forced', 'live', 'moles', 'endless', 'night', 'film', 'full', 'brilliantly', 'low-key', 'nuances', 'rarely', 'spoken', 'British', 'cinema', 'culture', 'one', 'German', 'invasion', 'British', 'soil', 'Kidman', 'possible', 'collusion', 'resonating', 'destruction', 'family', 'patriotic', 'need', 'go', 'war', 'trauma', 'single', 'mother', 'culture', 'strange', 'disjunction', 'very', 'Victorian', 'atmosphere', 'lack', 'modern', 'technology', 'outmoded', 'clothes', 'formal', 'way', 'speech', 'obsessions', 'ghosts', 'cemetaries', 'gruesome', 'photo', 'albums', 'dead', 'was', 'hoped', 'would', 'keep', 'deceased', 'spirit', 'nominal', 'setting', '1945', 'age', 'away', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'familiar', 'modern']",The Others

The director did an excellent job setting up the spooky atmosphere.  The plot begins when Grace (played by Nicole Kidman) wakes up screaming.  That was a good beginning, but then the movie mellowed out after that.  Grace answers the door to three people--a mute girl and an elderly couple--inquiring about servants' positions.  She hires them, introducing the two women to her children, who are allergic to the sun.  It is up to Bertha and Lydia to keep the curtains closed and the all the doors locked.  Why isn't totally clear until Grace hears a little boy sobbing, then someone running in the upstairs hallway.  The movie takes an eerie turn after the sobbing.  The children start talking about the day their mother &quot;went mad&quot;, but they don't say exactly what happened to her.  We are left to assume that her mental decline occurred when her husband never returned from WWII.  Grace grows more hysterical, thinking that intruders are in her house.  The servants start conspiring with each other, to do what isn't clear until the end.  Whether Grace is going mad isn't clear until the end. This movie has all the twists and turns of The Sixth Sense, including the neat tie at the end.  But if you're looking for heart-pounding suspense, you'll leave the theater feeling disappointed.

Just when you thought Ms. Kidman's career has taken a backseat after the divorce, she slams critics with an intensifying performance as Grace, the mother of two children, Annie and Nick (James Bentley) subjected to a mysterious disease that forbids them to come under strong light. With the misty landscape of a British coast and a cavernous mansion, where Grace practises locking one door before entering the next to prevent sunlight from filtering in - the mystery sets in - even more so after a housekeeper Mrs. Mills with her motley gang steps in.THE OTHERS may lack the intrigue in the Sixth sense as a paramormal scarefest but it boasts an unexpected twist that justifies the slow pacing. The performance of Ms. Kidman as a forlorn wife waiting for the return of her husband (Christopher Eccleston) is sterlingly vulnerable and emotive. THE OTHERS after a slew of right-in-your-face horror gore offered by this summer's Jeepers Creepers and 13th ghost is almost acutely refreshing. With its seasoned acting and Amenabar's prudent directing, it more than compensates for the gloomy mood enshrouding the movie that tests the patience of the audience. However, when the ending is revealed, the melancholic tragedy of Grace comes out hauntingly poignant and judiciously rewards the audience for the wait.",4,HAUNTINGLY POIGNANT,1007164800,"12 1, 2001",2001,1589,"['most', 'movie-goers', 'will', 'focus', 'inevitable', 'irony', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'starring', 'movie', 'produced', 'erstwhile', 'husband', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'THE', 'OTHERS', 'directed', 'Alejandro', 'Amenabar', 'Open', 'Your', 'Eyes', 'fame', 'beautifully', 'elegantly', 'controlled', 'suspense', 'horror', 'Just', 'when', 'thought', 'Ms.', 'Kidman', 'career', 'taken', 'backseat', 'divorce', 'slams', 'critics', 'intensifying', 'performance', 'Grace', 'mother', 'two', 'children', 'Annie', 'Nick', 'James', 'Bentley', 'subjected', 'mysterious', 'disease', 'come', 'strong', 'light', 'misty', 'landscape', 'British', 'coast', 'cavernous', 'mansion', 'where', 'Grace', 'locking', 'one', 'door', 'entering', 'next', 'prevent', 'sunlight', 'filtering', 'mystery', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'housekeeper', 'Mrs.', 'Mills', 'motley', 'gang', 'steps', 'in.THE', 'OTHERS', 'may', 'lack', 'intrigue', 'Sixth', 'sense', 'paramormal', 'scarefest', 'unexpected', 'twist', 'slow', 'pacing', 'performance', 'Ms.', 'Kidman', 'forlorn', 'wife', 'waiting', 'return', 'husband', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'sterlingly', 'vulnerable', 'emotive', 'OTHERS', 'slew', 'right-in-your-face', 'horror', 'gore', 'offered', 'summer', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', '13th', 'ghost', 'almost', 'acutely', 'refreshing', 'seasoned', 'acting', 'Amenabar', 'prudent', 'directing', 'more', 'compensates', 'gloomy', 'mood', 'enshrouding', 'movie', 'patience', 'audience', 'However', 'when', 'ending', 'revealed', 'melancholic', 'tragedy', 'Grace', 'out', 'hauntingly', 'poignant', 'judiciously', 'audience', 'wait']",The Others

I love seeing a film with great child acting.  The universal child-like fear of the unknown is the central theme throughout, and the two child actors here convey authentic fear.  But the standout performance here is from Nicole Kidman.  This is one of my favorites in her catalog.  There are many films in which she is stoic or comes across as an Ice Queen, fairly reluctant to show her emotional range.  But here she had me interested in her character on an emotional level; and how her character is dealing with the unusual, supernatural circumstances.

544438,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00003CYLJ,D. Litton,"[43, 47]","Highly atmospheric and foreboding, &quot;The Others&quot; is unlike any ghost story I've seen since Robert Wise's &quot;The Haunting&quot; in 1963. Director Alejandro Amenabar brings to the screen a uniquely chilling tale that slowly makes its way under our skin until it's almost unbearable. I don't know which aspect of the film I liked better: the ominous setting where the eerie story takes place, or the magnificent performance from Nicole Kidman.Kidman plays Grace, a mother of two children living in an expansive New England mansion surrounded by a ceaseless fog and dry vegetation. When three house servants show up at her door, they are bewildered by the manner in which Grace runs the household, closing each door before opening another, and closing any and all curtains to prevent all sunlight from invading the rooms.We learn the sunlight is harmful to her young children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley). From the beginning, Anne speaks of a past event that occurred between her and her mother, and of apparitions throughout the house. Grace dismisses her comments as rubbish, but becomes increasingly uneasy once she begins hearing voices in the upstairs rooms, and finds that doors in the house open and close by themselves without a key.As the movie progresses, Amenabar creates a distinctly uneasy atmosphere in which even the audience knows better than to look at this house as little more than an expensive home. From a continuous fog to the whisperings of voices and things that go bump in the night, the scares come not from what we see, but what we don't see, which is even scarier than you may think. Amenabar proves that one needn't be subjected to a special effect in order to be frightened.What helps the movie is the fact that it has a solid story to back its scares. What starts out as a slow-moving introduction to the characters and settings evolves into a first-class mystery on par with such mysteries as &quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; though this film's clues are much more apparent. You may have found the pieces to the puzzle involving the three housekeepers, but that doesn't mean you've solved the film's resolution, which is an unexpected gem.The real delight comes from the involving performance from Nicole Kidman, who evokes much of the fear throughout the film. There are times when she slowly makes her way into rooms to investigate suspicious noises, her eyes growing wider with psychological fear, and times when she becomes frantic, such as when she searches desperately for the curtains taken from the windows.&quot;The Others&quot; may very well be one of the best scare films we've ever seen. Amenabar gives his unique story a sense of fear that comes from the mind. In a decade of born-again slasher pics and gory bloodshed and mayhem, it's nice to be able to embrace something entirely different from the rest.",5,Strikingly original and genuinely scary.,998352000,"08 21, 2001",2001,2876,"['Highly', 'atmospheric', 'foreboding', 'quot', 'Others', 'quot', 'ghost', 'story', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Robert', 'Wise', 'quot', 'Haunting', 'quot', '1963', 'Director', 'Alejandro', 'Amenabar', 'screen', 'uniquely', 'chilling', 'tale', 'slowly', 'way', 'skin', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'aspect', 'film', 'liked', 'better', 'ominous', 'setting', 'where', 'eerie', 'story', 'place', 'magnificent', 'performance', 'Nicole', 'Kidman.Kidman', 'Grace', 'mother', 'two', 'children', 'living', 'expansive', 'New', 'England', 'mansion', 'surrounded', 'ceaseless', 'fog', 'dry', 'vegetation', 'When', 'three', 'house', 'servants', 'show', 'up', 'door', 'are', 'bewildered', 'manner', 'Grace', 'household', 'closing', 'door', 'opening', 'closing', 'curtains', 'prevent', 'sunlight', 'invading', 'rooms.We', 'learn', 'sunlight', 'harmful', 'young', 'children', 'Anne', 'Alakina', 'Mann', 'Nicholas', 'James', 'Bentley', 'beginning', 'Anne', 'past', 'event', 'occurred', 'mother', 'apparitions', 'house', 'Grace', 'comments', 'rubbish', 'increasingly', 'uneasy', 'once', 'hearing', 'voices', 'upstairs', 'rooms', 'doors', 'house', 'open', 'close', 'key.As', 'movie', 'Amenabar', 'distinctly', 'uneasy', 'atmosphere', 'even', 'audience', 'better', 'look', 'house', 'little', 'more', 'expensive', 'home', 'continuous', 'fog', 'whisperings', 'voices', 'things', 'go', 'bump', 'night', 'scares', 'come', 'not', 'what', 'see', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'even', 'scarier', 'may', 'think', 'Amenabar', 'one', 'need', ""n't"", 'be', 'subjected', 'special', 'effect', 'order', 'be', 'frightened.What', 'movie', 'fact', 'solid', 'story', 'back', 'scares', 'What', 'out', 'slow-moving', 'introduction', 'characters', 'settings', 'first-class', 'mystery', 'par', 'such', 'mysteries', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'film', 'clues', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'apparent', 'may', 'have', 'found', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'involving', 'three', 'housekeepers', ""n't"", 'mean', ""'ve"", 'solved', 'film', 'resolution', 'unexpected', 'gem.The', 'real', 'delight', 'involving', 'performance', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'who', 'much', 'fear', 'film', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'slowly', 'way', 'rooms', 'investigate', 'suspicious', 'noises', 'eyes', 'growing', 'wider', 'psychological', 'fear', 'times', 'when', 'frantic', 'such', 'when', 'desperately', 'curtains', 'taken', 'windows.', 'quot', 'Others', 'quot', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'scare', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Amenabar', 'unique', 'story', 'sense', 'fear', 'mind', 'decade', 'born-again', 'slasher', 'pics', 'gory', 'bloodshed', 'nice', 'be', 'able', 'embrace', 'something', 'entirely', 'different', 'rest']",The Others

It's a story taking place around World War 2; about a secluded family living in a large mansion that think their house is inhabited by ghosts.Nicole Kidman does an excellent job in potraying the worrying, over-protective mother of two children infected with a rather rare disease. Kidman is undoubtedly one of the most talented actresses present in Hollywood today; and this movie is yet another proof of her remarkable talent. If she wasn't nominated for an academy award in ""Moulin Rouge""; I'm sure she would have been nominated for this movie instead.Some would complain that this movie is too slow-paced for their taste; but that's just the beauty of this picture. The dark atmosphere present in the movie and the great performance of Kidman will somehow keep your interest till the end; even if the lead characters seem to spend nearly half the movie wandering about in the mansion and opening and closing doors. And for all those who taught the ending wasn't surprising at all; and that they figured everything out halfway through; blame the critics. It was them who felt the need to reveal to the readers that the ending was very much similar to ""The Sixth Sense"".

For a suspenseful movie The Others is probally one of the best that I have ever seen.The reason the movie only got 4 stars was because of the beginnning of the movie.To me it felt as if it was taking a really long time to get into the plot and into the fun but scary scenes.But even though the beginning might be slow the scenes that are shown for the rest of the movie is worth the wait.The Others has a fun feel to it as you watch each minute waiting for more tense scenes.The Others give's you the feeling that you spent your money for a good reason.But what makes the movie so good?What is the plot to the film?Nicole Kidman is the star of the movie and she plays Grace who is on an island during the war in which her husband was sent out to fight in.There she lives with her two children,Anne and Nicholas,who have an extremly rare diease where they cannot go into the light or they would gets hives and get very sick.Anne keeps complaining that the shades keep being opened and there is crying all caused by a little boy named Viktor.Grace is sick and tired of all of Anne's lying and always scaring her younger brother so she makes Anne say all of her prayers.But then doors start opening and there is banging coming from the upper floors and what about those three new servants that have just been hired to replace the last ones...who just disappeared!The Others is basecally wonderful.The DVD has two discs which I think is totally useless.All of the special features that are on the second disc could all fit on the first disc so I think the double disc thing is totally useless.So go see The Others right away.The two hours that you use in you day are worth it.The movie is fun and very suspenseful to give you the feeling in which that you want more.ENJOY!",4,Scary at....Heck!,1032480000,"09 20, 2002",2002,2399,"['start', 'off', 'reveiw', 'great', 'movie', 'filled', 'suspenseful', 'scary', 'scenes.The', 'movie', 'was', 'out', 'five', 'month', 'movie', 'theatre', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'commerical', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'five', 'months', 'came', 'movie', 'got', 'great', 'reveiws', 'everybody', 'really', 'liked', 'it.At', 'minute', 'knew', 'had', 'see', 'movie.When', 'did', 'see', 'movie', 'little', 'back', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'did', 'get', 'scared', 'more', 'then', 'one', 'time.The', 'suspense', 'scenes', 'made', 'feel', 'wonder', 'awe', 'when', 'film', 'ended', 'twist', 'ending', 'was', 'shock', 'feeling', 'wanted', 'more', 'suspenseful', 'movie', 'Others', 'probally', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.The', 'reason', 'movie', 'only', 'got', '4', 'stars', 'was', 'beginnning', 'movie.To', 'felt', 'was', 'taking', 'really', 'long', 'time', 'get', 'plot', 'fun', 'scary', 'scenes.But', 'even', 'beginning', 'might', 'be', 'slow', 'scenes', 'are', 'shown', 'rest', 'movie', 'wait.The', 'Others', 'fun', 'feel', 'watch', 'minute', 'waiting', 'more', 'tense', 'scenes.The', 'Others', 'give', 'feeling', 'spent', 'money', 'good', 'reason.But', 'what', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'What', 'plot', 'film', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'star', 'movie', 'Grace', 'who', 'island', 'war', 'husband', 'was', 'sent', 'out', 'fight', 'in.There', 'two', 'children', 'Anne', 'Nicholas', 'who', 'have', 'extremly', 'rare', 'diease', 'where', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'light', 'would', 'hives', 'get', 'very', 'sick.Anne', 'keeps', 'complaining', 'shades', 'keep', 'being', 'opened', 'crying', 'caused', 'little', 'boy', 'named', 'Viktor.Grace', 'sick', 'tired', 'Anne', 'lying', 'always', 'scaring', 'younger', 'brother', 'Anne', 'say', 'prayers.But', 'then', 'doors', 'start', 'opening', 'banging', 'coming', 'upper', 'floors', 'what', 'three', 'new', 'servants', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'hired', 'replace', 'last', 'ones', 'who', 'just', 'disappeared', 'Others', 'basecally', 'wonderful.The', 'DVD', 'two', 'discs', 'think', 'totally', 'useless.All', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'second', 'disc', 'could', 'fit', 'first', 'disc', 'so', 'think', 'double', 'disc', 'thing', 'totally', 'useless.So', 'go', 'see', 'Others', 'right', 'away.The', 'two', 'hours', 'use', 'day', 'are', 'it.The', 'movie', 'fun', 'very', 'suspenseful', 'give', 'feeling', 'want', 'more.ENJOY']",The Others

It's one of those European horror films, which already makes it better than most American films (forget the production values or Tom Cruise as the producer, this is NOT a typical Hollywood film).  It probably helps that the director, most of the cast, and most of the production team are European.  Plus, filming was done in Europe.  The result is one of the best haunted house films in a long time.  In a nutshell, the plot is about a family (Kidman and her, uh, 2 kids; the husband is off at war) near the end of WWII who begin to believe their home (one of those great crumbly mansions with long halls and dark chambers) is haunted.  But is it truly haunted or is Kidman slowly going mad? ....  These are but a few possibilities in this genuinely spooky film.What's more, the suspense is achieved almost entirely by direction, set design, sound, and acting.  The 2 kids are simply amazing.  The girl in particular is easily the equal of ""Sixth Sense"" Haley Joel Osment.  Kidman is a revelation, her controlled and mannered performance probably the best I've seen her do.  Special effects play almost no role in this film (to be honest, there are special effects but they are so well-disguised that you would never have known it unless the 2nd disc of this 2-DVD set revealed them.).  It is a bit like the film Castaway, which had a lot of special effects that were darn invisible.  I much prefer this sort of filming, where the special effects augment the storyline, rather than calling attention to themselves.  The strength of this film is that...even without any special effects at all, it would still be a powerful film.

Yet after seeing movie after movie with Nicole Kidman playing a cold as ice man manipulator, my movie psyche needs some payback.  I got it with this movie.So even though she introduces what may be her bitchiest character yet, it was nice to see she doesn't have nearly the power over people she would like you to think.  She plays a mother of two children, probably a widow, in post-war England.  She lives in a huge mansion, and has children who cannot be exposed to sunlight.  It is this condition that forces her to be tough and disciplined, especially to the new trio of servants she has just hired.But it is not only toughness out of necessity.  If you see how she OVER-punishes her children, and assumes it is the servants who left some doors open (it couldn't be HER!) that she also has some inner meanness to her.  If you've seen her other movies, you KNOW it, but if this is your first Nicole Kidman movie, you have to watch to see the true nature of the character come out.So when her fragile world starts crumbling around her, I for one was glad to see her unwind by finding that maybe she doesn't have all the power over her house she thinks she has.  We see all the beginning classic symptoms of the haunted house, with unexplained noises and physical things being mysteriously altered.  Of course, all around her deny everything, and after several instances of this, she has to make a decision to accept this, become stronger, or breakdown.I will reveal to you that all three things happen, but not necessarily in that order.  She does valiantly make a stand to hold her title of Ice Queen. But eventually the supernatural gauntlet she is dragged through causes her to eventually break down.  This was a big moment of the movie for me.However, I wouldn't be giving the movie four stars if it didn't have other things going for it.  There is a big secret plot twist that I imangine people will say was taken from another recent movie, but I will say it did get me hook, line, and sinker.  And just like that other movie, it honestly gives all the clues necessary to reach this conclusion upon a second viewing.Which is another reason why I like this.  I did not like ""Vanilla Sky"" (by the way, not the movie this one ""borrows"" from), and even upon a second viewing of ""Sky"", when I knew the secret, I still though the movie did not play fair with the audience.

A persistent fog cloaks a mansion on the Channel Island of Jersey, three people show up unsummoned to work as housekeeping staff after the previous staff has inexplicably abandoned the family living there, two young children that must live in darkness, a controlling mother, and a missing father - a great place to begin a Gothic yarn, isn't it?.The escalating tension of this film is not reliant on special effects wizardy but good old-fashioned character interaction, brilliant acting (by all parties), outstanding cinematography, and a sparse musical score.

Even if you've heard it was like The Sixth Sense, it really stands on its own from it and other modern suspense films.Not only is the acting from all the cast excellent, visually, THE OTHERS' set design and lighting heighten the atmosphere of foreboding. The exterior shots reminded me of the 70s horror classic Legend Of Hell House. The cinematographic style lets the story unfold moment by moment, keeping you enthralled in what is to come, all the way to the final few minutes.What struck me as odd (in a good way) is how much Nicole Kidman resembles Grace Kelly from her 50s movies, in several of the movie's scenes. I think it was her wardrobe and hair styles that gave me that impression.

This is a welcome relief sometimes, as I find some of the scariest films I have ever seen are more atmospheric, and low on blood and gore. There are times when the atmosphere of horror demands this type of imaginative and creative use. Also, the story itself is more of a drama based film, and the horror is introduced in a much more slower and very methodical way. There will be no spoilers in this review, as to write any would destroy the film for you if you have not seen it.Grace (Nicole Kidman) is a mother with two young children. Both of her children  [a girl and boy] suffer from a rare disease of the skin. This photosensistivity to the sun demands that they be kept out of the light, with curtains covering the windows, and at no time are they ever to be let outside. When a trio of servants arrive at her door, she hires them immediately: as she is in need of help since her place is so large. Grace is awaiting her husband's return from the war [WWII]. The gloomy feel of the film, and near neurotic demeanor of Grace tell the viewer early on that there is something more to her and the children. Especially after the servants arrive. The films atmosphere is much like that of Deborah Kerr's ""The Innocents."" I recommend the film, which is more cerebral in its thematic structure. Also, the ending does have an eerie surprise.

But I found what story there was boring and predictable, the progressive so-called spookiness of the servants laughable, and when they try to wrap everything up at the end with sweeping music and wistful last looks, I didn't care anymore. Definatley made for t.v. material. While I didn't figure out every detail of the ending, I was really close to it by the first half hour of viewing. If you saw the previews for this film in the theater, you've pretty much seen the film, or, at least the best of it. It tries hard to be ""the Sixth Sense"", or ""The Innocents"", but, in no way does it reach those levels of quality.  I don't mean to trash it, but it seems it's just another example of most of todays movie making, where it's about the Star, the publicity, everything but the movie itself. And I guess I'm just disappointed. Judging from most of the reviews, I'm definatley in the minority in my opinion of this film.

544469,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00003CYLJ,"""flickjunkie""","[4, 6]","Writer/director Alejandro Amenabar has burst onto the motion picture scene in a major way with this, his first American film.  The Spanish auteur had already made a mark in Spain with ""Abre Los Ojos"", a film he wrote, directed and scored, which was remade four years later by Cameron Crowe as ""Vanilla Sky"", starring Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman's ex-husband who co-produced both films.This film is outstanding in almost every respect.  With a microscopic budget of $17 million and one bankable star, Amenabar turned a great idea into a brilliant film.  As he has in past films, he also composed the music, which is exceptionally powerful and a perfect fit for the story.  There are few directors with the talent to write, direct and compose this effectively.  It is even more impressive when you consider that he is barely 30 years old.Amenabar's use of shadow and light is phenomenal and he is extremely adroit at utilizing the camera to maximize the suspense.  He is also very insightful in his direction of the actors.  While Nicole Kidman is a veteran, the children are both in their first film and Amenabar elicits terrific performances from each.The story is elegant in its simplicity and the ending is difficult to predict.  The use of the s&eacute;ance scene to flip the film on its ear is inspired, creating a defining moment by taking an indirect approach.  He brings us a supernatural thriller that is scary without the need for blood and gore, making the most of what is unseen.  Often compared with ""Sixth Sense"" because of the final plot twist, this film is better in most of its technical elements, despite being slightly less flashy in its presentation.As if Amenabar's genius weren't enough, Nicole Kidman kicks out the jams and delivers one of her best performances to date.  She is utterly believable as Grace, the neurotically overprotective matriarch and mistress of the house.  Her interaction with the children is exceedingly genuine, replete with nurturing affection and backbiting irritation at her daughter's perceived recalcitrance.  Grace's daughter Anne is played by Alakina Mann who gives a phenomenal performance in her first film.  Mann is sassy and stubborn and shows a strong backbone in the face of her oppressive mother.  James Bentley, as her brother Nicholas, plays off Mann extremely well.  Bentley's timidity and reliance on his sister creates a strong symbiosis between them that is extremely realistic.This is a fantastic thriller by a director with a very promising future.  While the pacing is sometimes overly deliberate, the story, music, camerawork, and the acting are first rate.  I rated it 9/10.

I'm usually suspicious of people who say things like that about movies or books, but in this case, as in the case of The Sixth Sense, it's definitely the truth.The Others reminded me of Alfred Hitchcock's movies in the way that one scene builds upon another scene and on and on until you're hooked and couldn't stop watching even if you wanted to. There's suspense, mystery, clues that seem to make no sense, wonderfully complex characters, and the perfect spooky and disturbing, yet beautiful, mansion in which the story  all takes place.Nicole Kidman is very convincing and perfectly cast in the lead role of The Others. She is surrounded by an equally excellent supporting cast, particularly the boy and girl who play her children. But I think the main star of this movie is the house. I found it fascinating to go from room to room and observe what each one revealed about the people who lived there and the plot that was unfolding.I thought The Others was a unique movie that could certainly be compared to The Sixth Sense, but I think it stands alone as a creative and satisfying piece of work. I think the difference between these two films is that in The Others you can't be sure that anything is what it seems to be while in The Sixth Sense it is exactly what it appears to be.

Taylor ""GFT""","[32, 37]","To a certain extent, one's enjoyment of THE OTHERS will depend on how quickly you recognize the major plot device on which the entire film turns.  Once recognition sets in, how much you are able to further enjoy the film will then depend on how much you have become engaged by the characters--and it is here, really, that the film stumbles a bit, not so much through the way it is done but rather through the way the characters must be played in order for their behavior to make sense at the film's conclusion.The premise, which seems deeply influenced by both Henry James' THE TURN OF THE SCREW and the 1960s film version known as THE INNOCENTS, concerns a woman who resides with her two children in an isloated mansion following World War II.  Her situation is dire: her husband is missing in action and presumed dead; her children suffer from a rare genetic disease that makes sunlight dangerous to them; her servants have departed in the night without a word of warning.  The latter problem seems remedied by the arrival of new servants--but no sooner are they installed than odd happenings begin to occur.  Is the woman going mad?  Are the servants involved?  Have intruders secretly entered the house?  Or could it be--something unearthly?The cast is exceptionally good here, with Fionnula Flanagan as the newly arrived servant Mrs. Mills and children Alakina Mann and James Bentley giving remarkable performances.  But the focus is on Nicole Kiddman as Grace, a role that Kiddman plays with a white-knuckled grip and considerable ferocity--so much so that it becomes extremely difficult to like, much less sympathize, with the character.  In some respects, however, this is ultimately necessary for this extremely plot-driven film to have any significant impact, and in hindsight it is hard to imagine that the role could be played in any other way; still, hindsight does not allow you to engage fully with the character when you are in the midst of the film.  It is a flaw, but it is an unavoidable one--and the film is so remarkably stylish that it largely overcomes both the anticipated plot-twist and Kiddman's necessarily ferocious performance.The production values are first rate all the way down the line. Everything looks right, sounds right, feels right.  But two items deserve special mention: the exceptional soundtrack, which was composed by director Alejandro Amenabar himself, and the stunning cinematography, which has tremendous visual texture and which neatly blends a fluidity of movement with a remarkably claustrophobic feel.  If your tastes run to special effects and blood-spatter horror films, you are likely to disappointed, for there are none in THE OTHERS; Amenabar craftily creates tension more via what is suggested rather than shown, and doors left ajar and half-heard sounds are his devices of choice; it is all very subtle and yet remarkably chilling.The DVD package is a double-disk set, with the film on one disk and bonuses on the other.  Although the bonuses are often quite interesting--particularly a documentary on individuals who actually suffer from hyper-sensitively to sunlight--they actually contribute little to the film itself, and it is a bit surprising that such a small bonus package would require a second disk.  The sound for the feature is also problematic re home viewing, and I recommend that viewers play it at top volume, for there is no middle ground--everything is very quiet or very loud, and the contrast adds tremendously to the film's effect.It is extremely difficult to know how to rate this film, for as I've noted the very nature of the story has two embedded flaws: the almost inevitable recognition of the major plot device and the necessity of Kiddman's over-the-top performance.  But even though I recognized the nature of the plot device very early in the film, and even though I found &quot;Grace&quot; an unlikeable woman, this did not actually prevent me from feeling the icy breath with which director Amenabar endows THE OTHERS.

It is not about ghosts waiting behind closed doors ready to terrorize the characters, as well as the audience. Because of the way it was presented in those previews, it is a little disappointing emotionally as well as slow paced. However, its new perspective, which you must wait for until the very end of the film, more than makes up for this. On many subjects we assume so much and know so little. Once in a while, in the written word, or on the screen, we are faced with a new perspective that probes the deepest part of our soul. The Others is such a motion picture, the type that you cannot leave behind in the theater. While the cast's performance is excellent, it is the storyline that carries the movie.

544479,A1XDMYX8QOW07N,B00003CYLJ,Geoffrey Kleinman,"[90, 107]","The Others isn't your typical ghost story; there isn't the quantity of jump-out-of-your-seat thrills you'd expect to find in a film like this. In fact, The Others is virtually chill-free for the first hour. But what The Others lacks in quantity, it makes up in quality. Instead of a roller coaster of cheap chills and thrills, The Others takes a much denser and darker approach to the ghost story.The Others takes a considerable amount of time to set everything up - almost too much. Halfway through the movie I wondered if there was going to be a pay off. Ultimately there is quite a pay off, but it takes so long to get there you might not feel it's 'worth it'. Despite the fact that I found The Others to be quite slow, I did enjoy it. Nicole Kidman does a great job as the neurotic and tortured lead, and she's backed up by a strong supporting cast. Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar lights almost the entire movie by candle light, something I haven't seen since Barry Lyndon. This gives The Others a soft and warm look that is uncommon to the genre. Amenabar also makes light a character in the film, where daylight becomes much scarier than the warmth and comfort of the dark. If you're planning on seeing The Others, I'd advise you to avoid reading any reviews which talk about the plot. The film takes a number of twists and turns which can easily be spoiled. This might be a good film to wait for DVD, except for the risk of the plot getting spoiled before you get a chance to see it.

This movie offers glimpses of troubled human souls.  It's almost more Chekhov than Hitchcock.The suspense and thrills are Hitchcockian, but the desperate attempt by the main character to cling to Catholic catechism and the emphasis the movie places on religion seems something new-- Almedovarian?  Trapped on the foggy isle of Jersey, a mother tries to keep things under control-- which is not easy, since her two children are so allergic to light that any light stronger than a candle causes them to break out, and sunlight would kill them.  Her husband has not returned from the war, though the war's been over for a year and a half.  The servants have disappeared without a word, not even waiting for their wages, and to top it all off, Ann, her daughter, claims to hear noises and see a boy named ""Victor.""Three new would-be servants arrive and are hired at once.  Lydia never speaks, but nobody is quite sure what happened to traumatize her.What's of most interest I think in Almedovar's spooky film is the emphasis on religion.  There's a sorrow running throughout that approaches tragedy.  Whoever is haunting the house, nobody is going to Heaven.  The movie raises issues of madness, love, devotion and alternate realities that are broached delicately and with insight.I found myself more interested in the movie after learning the surprise ending-- it made the characters' behavior early on, and the revelations of what they knew or tried not to know, more human and powerful.  Ultimately, there is no happy ending here-- the movie is practically nihilistic.

544489,A1EKSETIBS9ETQ,B00003CYLJ,,"[2, 5]","I felt the twist from the 6th Sense was a knock-off of a children book that I read about 14-18 years ago.  I was even more shocked that this movie eerily had more resemblances to that children book.  Actually this movie started very slowly and about 3/4 of the way in to it, I got this strangle feeling how it was going to end.  And I was right.The acting was good, but if you were casually watching it, there were not much in the early scenes to excite you. Nicole Kidman moving from room to room as exciting as it sound gets pointless.  It had the potential of being a small world feeling like ""An American Haunting"" type movies that end up half baked.  The ending really redeemed the whole movie in the  last 10 minutes or so.  The ending is like most modern ghost stories: The Sixth Sense, Silent Hill, Stay, Mulholland Drive where the plot string you along in a curtain narrative (somewhat confusing storyline) and in the final ten minutes tell you the truth and then you go: oooh.  I think that is cheating, but some of my favorites movies: 6th Sense, 12 Monkeys, Silent Hill, Mul. Dr. are done in this style.  They were more interesting in the beginning though.The spoilers so keep away-The children book I am referring to, which I forgot the title, is about 2 children living by a lake.  Some of the details may be a little foggy.  For some reasons the children were abused verbally and physically by some woman, forgot who.  The kids goal were to seek out their mothers (in this sense the father of this movies) to protect them.  But she seems distant and they never could catch her when they get close (like the widow in the 6th Sense).  When they finally did by a lake, they found out their fate.  Their mother, if I remembered, commented suicide into the lake joining her two children that drowned there sometime ago.  They were reunited at death and the mean lady that was abusing them was actually alive (like the clairvoyant and the boy, Victor in this movie) and so was their mother at the time.  I might be wrong recalling some of the details from the children book, but that was some time ago.  I do remembered being sad/ upset for a whole week; why on earth would an elementary school library be so cruel to have a book like that.  I then thought it would also have made a good movie and a profound experience for other.  If you know what book I am talking about, post a comment.The ending of this movie really reflected why some situations occurred early on.  Why the faces of the two children were pale with spider vein at times.  The mother and children odd mood swings.  All the pictures and foggy scenes made more sense too.  The reason for the light: referring to spirits moving on to the other side, and the curtains: the living moving out.Overall, if you have not seen the 6th Sense or read a similar ghost story, this is definitely a superb movie.  Even if the tension was slowly building up at the beginning it really heightens at the end.

The film itself is excellent on all levels except one: originality. I've read this same story (I won't ruin it for you!) in the works of H.P. Lovecraft, as well as have seen it on The Twilight Zone and other Twilight Zone-rip off shows. However, the condition the children are afflicted with in the story puts a different twist on the story altogether, and sets up some potentially eerie situations. This condition is actually confronted and explained in a featurette included on the DVD.The Others isn't a horror film; it's more of a paranormal thriller. The viewer will experience plenty of eerie moments, as well as a few scary ones, but nothing really altogether out of the ordinary haunted house stories of old.

Can't say much about it, but just know- I had goosebumps for hours after leaving the theater.  Kidman is a one-man show. She can pull of a rather long movie, with subtle dialog and it never seems to be annoying( for the most part). Yes, the movie slacked slightly in places that the editing scissors could have helped, but I put her on a pedestal with Tom Hanks.  Like him, in ""Cast Away"", Kidman has very long scenes and moments of awkward silence that most actors couldn't pull through. She does. It's her chemistry with her character Grace.  Her hair, her costumes, her accent. It's perfect and  very reminiscent of Hitchcock.  I rarely found myself noticing anything around me while watching this film. I think this movie will keep the beautiful redhead from being typecast throughout her career.Just a tad about the plot. (You really don't want to know much at all)As the audience we are fascinated by Grace, her huge, very sparse home, her children who have an allergy to light, and the claustraphobia from the curtains always being closed. Her children, she explains, must never see the light, or they will die. This aspect alone makes you cringe with fright because, well, everything goes bump in the night...or perhaps in the constant dark.Grace hires some house/lawn keepers that appear on her doorstep looking for work..and so the plot begins to develop and unfold.So is it scary? YUP!Does it help to turn the volume down? NOPE!I personally recommend a fabulous pillow to sink your face into while enjoying ""the Others""My only reason for giving the movie four stars is because like the movie ""Memento""(a GREAT movie), I can not deny there are some scenes that seem to drag a bit to long . But, like, ""Memento"" even those annoying moments are all worthwhile. Figuring out the meaning of the title, ""The Others"" is much  like the deeper multi-conscious meaning of the name ""Memento"" The title is a prize at the end of the film.On a footnote: this DVD has some of the best documentary footage I have ever enjoyed watching.  The cast/crew/director all let us spy behind the makings of ""the Others"" on a very personal level.  It was definitely worth watching.I have seen this movie three times. It has replay value. I never seem to get enough of the story and secret plot twists. So, as a reviewer, I must say it's one to keep.

He got away with the original &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; and certainly made better choices than in Crowe's remake, but in this film, the whole use of the &quot;Skin disease&quot; throughout made it so blatantly obvious that there was something wrong with the children. Number one, the disease he chose is so rare (only 120 in the US) that one automatically assumes the mother is hiding something, that the children are perhaps ghosts or vampires who don't enjoy sunlight, plus the locking doors behind them adds to the suspicion that the mother actually knows something is up (Which we as the audience are NOT supposed to believe).

She's just great. Such a pent up neurotic would steer one inch and she would become a caricature. Instead, every gesture is perfect, every fit of hysteria just has to be there. Like every note in a Bach sonata. Her icy, statuesque beauty, allure and hairdo (!) make it all ""come together"".

""kate_hartshorn"" (Irvine, CA) is right: this could well be a practical case of a ""psychology of perception"" course.

I was lucky enough this time to only watch the pictures and a general look at the cast. Had I read even Amazon's ""plot keywords"" would have basically spoilt all the fun (as it has, many times before).I didn't really FEEL much for the characters, although I confess I suffered with poor troubled Grace. I give it a ten although, for I suspect it follows the ""rules of the genre"" that preclude any glorious and hefty monologue alla ""Pacino"" or something heroic, political or socially relevant.I can't see how this film could be improved, but I am not so sure it would stand a ""second viewing"".

Over the years she's been miscast as a pretty thing that's fun to look at.  In this film, her acting talents are so overwhelming, she should have gotten the Oscar for them.

After the movie, you find yourself continually remembering moments in the film that now fit together.

But when you know that small but vital piece of information, it is not just seamless-it's close to perfect. The Others uses virtually no detectable special effects, the way every other ghost story has. There are no moving walls, no monster makeup, no indications at all. The only thing that is more than just psychologically abnormal is the extreme presence of a fog, which can be created by a simple fog machine or graphic effect. That's another great thing about this movie. All the tricks and twists that we see, such as curtains being opened, doors being left ajar, and doors being unlocked when they were obviously shut before, are things that a normal person does. The psychological thrill is really how it all fits together to create a ghastly, macabre picture that leaves you amazed.

A quite acceptable situation, though rather bizarre, without being strange. Every detail is slightly surprising, or original but believable. The whole object of the film is to reverse the situation of the beginning to reveal the truth and those who seem normal and pretend they are haunted by some ghosts end up being the real ghosts. It all hinges around the paranoia of the mother. She is obsessed by something that makes her tense or angry in no time and for little. Till one day she breaks down completely when those they call the intruders take down all the curtains that are draping all the windows of the house. The end then is banal: the living intruders abandon the house in the hands of the dead ghosts. The interest of the film is this inverted situation, this upside down ghost story. Then we are irritated or bothered by the way they don't speak but only whisper, the way they are obsessed by keys and locked doors, by any sound that is not explainable from their sole point of view. Everything is done in nuances, discretely, hardly fully expressed. We have to navigate among these strange milestones or obstacles to finally understand the truth but only when it is revealed to us. A very effective film but a film that does not require a second viewing because it only works if we do not know the truth.

Both these films had a brother & sister as main characters.

All three films were intimate, not a large cast, nor did they need one, though ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" did have a larger cast of characters, though it still remained a intimate childhood story of a adult world.It has been said that Nicole Kidman's performance as ""Grace Stewart"" in ""the Others,"" is the greatest of her career, & I have to agree. Nicole is the epitome of a woman pushed over the edge of insanity. A nervous break down performance if there ever was one! It must have drained her, not only mentally, but physically. The siblings, Alakina Mann as ""Anne Stewart,"" & James Bently as ""Nicholas Stewart,"" provide this film with some of the strongest & most believable child performances I've ever seen! The supporting cast was excellent as well.""The Others"" work so well because a taught & sturdy script, claustrophobic cinematography, spot on directing, & a soundtrack that is subtle, & when need be, crashing down like thunder. But it is the totally convincing acting, the effective spooky yet elegant mansion, & the tense well done sound effects that make this movie genuinely scary. It is the imagination of what could be lurking around the corner or behind a door that raises the prickly hairs on my neck. The thump in the dark. It is the twist ending that just blows me away every time I see this film! It is truly, the anti ""Sixth Sense,"" just when the badly over trodden haunted house/ghost sub-genre needed it the most!This Blu-ray is highly recommended as a upgrade.

Baer,"[0, 0]","The Others won't blow you away with special effects, but it will make you jump.Set in a dark, gloomy English estate in the year 1945, The Other is a story about a woman named Grace Stewart (Kidman) who still waits for her husband to return from the war against Germany.  She guardedly protects her two children, Ann and Nicholas, who are &quot;photosensitive.&quot;  One day, three strangers show up in answer to an ad for servants.  After the strangers arrive, odd things start happening, from voices being heard everywhere, to strange noises.All along, Grace appears to become more and more paranoid, and the three strangers become more and more enigmatic and sinister (although they don't appear to do anything wrong).  The suspense continues to build, until the surprise ending.  I can't say anymore without blowing it for people who haven't seen this movie.Nicole Kidman turns in  teriffic performance as Grace, the over-protective, paranoid, and borderline crazy mother.  The rest of the cast play their parts well, though I was hoping to see more of Chistopher Eccleston (Gone in 60 Seconds).  Great camera work, and a gloomy set combine to create a creepy and frantic atmosphere.Don't rent this if you are looking for a Halloween, Nightmare on Elm St. type of movie.  However, if you like gothic-like suspense, and trying to stay a step ahead of the movie by predicting the outcome, you'll love this show.

It's very much like The Sixth Sense, with a very stunning ending, although the buildup isn't quite as dramatic and the ending isn't quite as stunning.Nicole Kidman plays the lead, Grace, perfectly.  She starts out normal and very protective of her children.  Her children are allergic to light, so the house is normally completely dark.  As the movie progresses, Kidman begins to lose her grip on her sanity.  She plays it perfectly, slowly losing it.  It's an outstanding performance on her part.The story starts out very slow, with three new servants arriving and basically having things explained to them.  It does take a while for things to get going, around a half an hour.  Up until then, be ready to sit through some rather tedious dialogue and exposition.However, once things pick up, they really pick up.  The suspense builds through several riveting scenes.  Unfortunately, you probably know some of them from the previews, which gave away a couple cool scenes.  But there are some unexpected twists, right up until the last twenty minutes, when there are two huge shocks.The lighting is very well done, keeping the mood perfectly dark.  There really is no humor in this movie, so be ready for a somber, if not downright depressing movie.  For you special effects junkies out there, this isn't the movie for you.  The only real special effects are some fades and some bad green screen work, which looks extremely fake.  But, despite the fact that there's a feature on the effects, there's really no need for them.Overall, this was a very good film.  The beginning was slow, but if you can stand the wait, the rest of the movie more than makes up for things.",4,"Starts Slow, Finishes With a Bang",1023062400,"06 3, 2002",2002,1805,"[""'re"", 'fan', 'old-time', 'ghost', 'story', 'where', 'suspense', 'entire', 'movie', 'then', ""'ll"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'Others', 'very', 'much', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'very', 'stunning', 'ending', 'buildup', ""n't"", 'quite', 'dramatic', 'ending', ""n't"", 'quite', 'stunning.Nicole', 'Kidman', 'lead', 'Grace', 'perfectly', 'normal', 'very', 'protective', 'children', 'children', 'are', 'allergic', 'light', 'house', 'normally', 'completely', 'dark', 'movie', 'Kidman', 'lose', 'grip', 'sanity', 'perfectly', 'slowly', 'losing', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'part.The', 'story', 'out', 'very', 'slow', 'three', 'new', 'servants', 'arriving', 'basically', 'having', 'things', 'explained', 'take', 'while', 'things', 'get', 'going', 'half', 'hour', 'then', 'be', 'ready', 'sit', 'rather', 'tedious', 'dialogue', 'exposition.However', 'once', 'things', 'pick', 'up', 'really', 'pick', 'up', 'suspense', 'several', 'riveting', 'scenes', 'Unfortunately', 'probably', 'know', 'previews', 'gave', 'away', 'couple', 'cool', 'scenes', 'are', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'right', 'up', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'when', 'are', 'two', 'huge', 'shocks.The', 'lighting', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'keeping', 'mood', 'perfectly', 'dark', 'really', 'humor', 'movie', 'so', 'be', 'ready', 'somber', 'not', 'downright', 'depressing', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'junkies', 'there', ""n't"", 'movie', 'only', 'real', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'fades', 'bad', 'green', 'screen', 'work', 'extremely', 'fake', 'fact', 'feature', 'effects', 'really', 'need', 'them.Overall', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'beginning', 'was', 'slow', 'can', 'stand', 'wait', 'rest', 'movie', 'more', 'up', 'things']",The Others
544523,A106016KSI0YQ,B00003CYLJ,Jay Dickson,"[3, 3]","Nicole Kidman got some fine notices when she first appeared in DEAD CALM and FLIRTING, but she pretty much disappeared into dull girlfriend roles during the years of her marriage to Tom Cruise. She did garner critical attention for her funny comic turn in TO DIE FOR, but the part closely approximated the press's conception of her (as scheming arm-candy) and it wasn't until this fine thriller by Alejandro Almenabar came out in 2001 that people began treating her seriously. (Although she was nominated for her first Best Actress Oscar for MOULIN ROUGE--which came out earlier that year--, it wasn't until the fine notices for her work in THE OTHERS that people started taking her role in MR more seriously.)Even without Kidman's splendid turn as the neurotically brittle Grace, the mistress of the mysterious Isle of Jersey mansion where she lives during WWII with her small children, this Gothic chiller would be a real treat. The pace is purposefully slow, and the colors are all watery and muted: the gigantic house surrounded by fog and greenery seems like something out of a Willkie Collins sensation novel. Grace lives in the mansion bereft of her husband (who has left her to go to War) and servants (who recently left Grace and her children on a  traumatic day in the recent past we hear referred to again and again in the film ). Her eldest child, the willful Anne (Alakina Mann, in a memorable child's performance), is reporting encounters with a frightened and angry family of ghosts living in the house with them.

It is a reflection on the talent of director Alejandro Amenabar that small things, like a door slamming shut in one's face or a ghostly hand upon one's cheek are far more frightening than any amount of special effects that films in this genre are increasingly becoming reliant upon.  A sense of claustrophobia is introduced from the outset by the thick fog surrounding the house in which most of the action takes place, and also by the permanently closed curtains and doors that prevent sunlight from brightening the rooms.In this house the light must always be contained, because the two young children (who live there with their mother) are photosensitive, and exposure to daylight will make them very ill.  But it would seem that the family and their three somewhat mysterious servants are not the only inhabitants of the darkened house.  Footsteps are heard, doors are opened, curtains are removed, but search as they may, nobody can find the perpetrators of these actions.  And it would seem that whatever these beings are, they bear an ever-increasing amount of malevolent ill will towards the family.The film's conclusion is unexpected, even for those viewers who have managed to second-guess an earlier plot twist prior to its revelation.  The surprise factor is at least partly due to the outstanding performances by the cast; special mention must be made of Alakina Mann, who is a young actress with a very bright future.  This film is an example of outstanding cinematic production, and to maximise its impact, it is best watched in a darkened room.",5,&quot;The intruders are leaving.

But upon reflection I also think there are enough holes in the premise to drive several large Army trucks through.  Then again maybe it's not holes but failure to provide an explanation.  Because from what I'm told, the other world is indeed constructed mentally but is as physical as this one, and that what people love here is replicated over there, including homes and fondest possessions. So that means the film would add up.  Though respecting Nicole Kidman's art I have never fallen in love with her an actress, always feeling she was cold and remote.  But in this film I fell hook, line and sinker for her classic beauty, subtlety, being her character and not just acting her character, and the immense range and shading of what she does in this film.

It is not violent, there is no nudity, no cruelty, no blood or extreme terror-filled scenes.  My daughter loves this film because, as she puts it, it is so ""sad"" and ""beautiful"" with cool music.  The children actors are astounding and will captivate any kid who watches.  The photography is excellent, the sets, ambiance, and especially the music is top-notch.  In a DVD sea of shocking and inappropriate horror subject matter, The Others offers something you as a parent can view with your child and actuallygain insights into tragedy, resolve, and hidden intentions.The ending is especially good because it has no good or bad people or anything simplistic or pedestrian.This being said, be cautioned that suicide, murder and a brief husband/wife intimacy scene are all implied, as well as the theme that a marriage has ended.  These are big and painful subjects that you may not wish our 13-year-old to see, but be assured that nothing is really depicted on screen as such.  But it is a part of the story and you may need to be prepared to explain these things in whatever manner you see fit.Aside from this parental-oriented endorsement I can suggest this film to any adult who is looking for a textured story with excellent acting.  Do not compare this to Sixth Sense or any other recent ""surprise ending"" ghost movies because it is more a character and mood piece that a whodunnit or mystery.  Most will figure the movie out before it is over so if it is a shocker or puzzle you seek this is not likely to grab you.",5,Perfect first ghost story,1131667200,"11 11, 2005",2005,1594,"['perfect', 'ghost', 'story', 'younger', 'people', 'PG-13', 'age', 'range', 'not', 'violent', 'nudity', 'cruelty', 'blood', 'extreme', 'terror-filled', 'scenes', 'daughter', 'film', 'because', 'so', 'sad', 'beautiful', 'cool', 'music', 'children', 'actors', 'are', 'astounding', 'will', 'captivate', 'kid', 'who', 'photography', 'excellent', 'sets', 'ambiance', 'especially', 'music', 'top-notch', 'DVD', 'sea', 'shocking', 'inappropriate', 'horror', 'subject', 'matter', 'Others', 'something', 'parent', 'can', 'view', 'child', 'actuallygain', 'insights', 'tragedy', 'resolve', 'intentions.The', 'ending', 'especially', 'good', 'good', 'bad', 'people', 'anything', 'simplistic', 'pedestrian.This', 'being', 'said', 'be', 'cautioned', 'suicide', 'murder', 'brief', 'husband/wife', 'intimacy', 'scene', 'are', 'implied', 'as', 'well', 'theme', 'marriage', 'ended', 'are', 'big', 'painful', 'subjects', 'may', 'not', 'wish', '13-year-old', 'see', 'be', 'assured', 'nothing', 'really', 'depicted', 'screen', 'such', 'part', 'story', 'may', 'need', 'be', 'prepared', 'explain', 'things', 'manner', 'see', 'fit.Aside', 'parental-oriented', 'endorsement', 'can', 'suggest', 'film', 'adult', 'who', 'looking', 'textured', 'story', 'excellent', 'acting', 'Do', 'not', 'compare', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'other', 'recent', 'surprise', 'ending', 'ghost', 'movies', 'more', 'character', 'mood', 'piece', 'whodunnit', 'mystery', 'Most', 'will', 'figure', 'movie', 'out', 'so', 'shocker', 'puzzle', 'seek', 'not', 'likely', 'grab']",The Others

Not only did she get many cover page stories about her heartbreaking divorce, but she finally proved that she was more than Tom Cruise's wife, and that she was a serious dramatic actress. First came the huge success of Moulin Rouge, which established Nicole as a tender beauty, a talented singer, and a symbol of glamour. Then came her finest dramatic role to date, in The Others. This film is not a horror film. It is a melodrama with supernatural overtones. It is about life after death, but it goes much deeper than that.  There is a central message to the story.. At the end, when Nicole says she loves her children, even though we have learned the shocking and gruesome truth about her, we feel sympathy for her.  This is Nicole Kidman's art, and her art alone, making us feel sympathy for her. she is a tremendous actress, and deserves even greater roles. She deserves to follow in the footsteps of the greats...Crawford, Garbo, Dietrich.. And I believe she will. She has the talent, beauty, and class to become a genuine superstar. The Others proves what we suspected all along.There are two scenes in The Others that stand out in my memory. One is when Kidman is lost in the fog and finds her long lost husband. The expression on her face is moving and defiantly sentimental..in a world of actresses that would rather not show such vivid and beautiful emotion. The very best scene, to me, is when Kidman is standing at the gate, after her husband has left her, looking very wistful and sad. It is masterful.The Others is the showcase that Kidman has deserved for a long time. With her performance in this film and Moulin Rouge, Nicole Kidman has covered all the dramatic bases.

In the tradition of classic ghost story films such as &#65533;The Haunting&#65533; (the original 1963 version) and &#65533;The Innocents&#65533;, here director Allejandro Amenabar crafts a superb old-school-style additon to those worthy predecessors.Eschewing ludicrous digital monsters and MTV-style editing, Amenabar&#65533;s film builds slowly and gradually, slyly creating a dense and rich atmosphere, a quality so utterly lacking in many so-called horror films of the last twenty years. (&#65533;Silence of the Lambs&#65533; and &#65533;Jacob&#65533;s Ladder&#65533; being the exceptions). Here is a wonderfully old-fashioned, truly scary ghost story that brings to mind Henry James&#65533;  &#65533;The Taming of the Shrew&#65533; as well as the aformentioned classic films.Though the entire (small) cast is outstanding, Nicole Kidman gives, in my opinion, the finest performance of her career; her chilly demeanor has never been put to better use. She maintains a tight-fisted grip on a performance that could have, in the hands of a less talented actor, spilled over into irritatingly shrill histrionics, and perhaps even outright camp. Instead, her multi-layered and tense depiction of her character, Grace, allows us to experience the gradual horror along with her, and makes the journey into this weird, creepy universe credible. (If there is any justice in the world, she'll not only be nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award, but recieve it.)To describe the plot would give even the small shocks away; indeed, there are two scenes scary enough that you may actually forget to breathe. Prepare yourself for maximum chills: there is a scene (and this gives nothing away) in which Grace finds something; what she uncovers is unbelievably eerie.

Into the fog bound large mansion and adjoining grounds comes a mysterious threesome, ostensibly answering her ad for gardener and housekeeper.  These three are introduced to her children who are suffering from acute sensitivity to light [shades of Roderick Usher in Poe's work?]  Thus the servants are admonished to always close the doors and lock them behind them and to take care that the drapes are always drawn prior to the children's movements, oh, and to keep it quiet so as not to activate Nicole's migraines.  The children start seeing and hearing things, and eventually Nicole must acknowledge that something is amiss in the house and that there are `others' lurking about.  How the three servants and her absent husband factor into the story makes for a nice turning point and twist in the tale as it progresses.

544548,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,B00003CYLJ,Joker,"[2, 2]","I just finished watching this movie after renting it tonight.  Time to review it.This movie was recommended to me by my friend here on Amazon, Brian Nallick (""Metalman Minnesota"").  Thanks Brian.I don't want to go into a summary of the plot, etc. because there are 743 reviews already written.  I just want to say a few things.I had heard a lot about this movie over the years, but had never seen it until tonight.  It's definitely a movie that is right up my alley - a haunted house/ghost story that relies on atmosphere and psychological horror and suspense rather than CGI, blood, gore, and anything and everything that is obvious.  This movie is often compared to The Innocents (1961).  The stories are at least loosely similar and certain scenes look alike in both movies.  In my opinion, The Others isn't quite as good as The Innocents, but it's definitely up there with the best haunted house/ghost story movies ever made.  Nicole Kidman does some great acting.  I think The Innocents has a spookier and more haunting atmosphere, but The Others has a lot of spooky moments as well.  Check out the outdoor scenes in the fog and at night.

It started out well enough: a subtle, slow-burn build-up of the tension, low-key camera work, no intrusion of loud and melodramatic music. Nicole Kidman (looking remarkably like Grace Kelly) plays a very uptight, bible-obsessed mom of two kids who, vampire-like, can't be exposed to sunlight - hence the shadowy setting for the movie. The enigmatic servants arrive at her isolated English house, the place seems to be haunted, she neurotically locks the doors. So far so good.But - and this is a really big but - the attempt at a scary socko finale falls flat enough that you could slide it under a door. Let's not mince words, if you've seen &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, your reaction to this movie will be &quot;Seen it!&quot; What's more, that far superior horror film had its own, involving plot, and the surprise at the end came as a surprise; you probably didn't see it coming (at least, I didn't) even though subtle clues were dropped throughout. &quot;The Others&quot;, by contrast, makes it abundantly clear that &quot;we're leading up to a big shocker ending!&quot; That lead-up IS the plot of the movie, and when it comes, it doesn't seem very original, or even all that scary.Decent opening, bad payoff.",2,"Haunted by other, better flicks",1022976000,"06 2, 2002",2002,1251,"['wanted', 'like', 'horror', 'flick', 'started', 'out', 'well', 'enough', 'subtle', 'slow-burn', 'build-up', 'tension', 'low-key', 'camera', 'work', 'intrusion', 'loud', 'melodramatic', 'music', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'looking', 'remarkably', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'very', 'uptight', 'bible-obsessed', 'mom', 'two', 'kids', 'who', 'vampire-like', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'exposed', 'sunlight', 'hence', 'shadowy', 'setting', 'movie', 'enigmatic', 'servants', 'arrive', 'isolated', 'English', 'house', 'place', 'be', 'haunted', 'neurotically', 'doors', 'So', 'far', 'so', 'good.But', 'really', 'big', 'attempt', 'scary', 'socko', 'finale', 'flat', 'enough', 'could', 'slide', 'door', 'Let', 'not', 'mince', 'words', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'reaction', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'quot', 'Seen', 'quot', 'What', 'more', 'far', 'superior', 'horror', 'film', 'had', 'own', 'involving', 'plot', 'surprise', 'end', 'came', 'surprise', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'subtle', 'clues', 'were', 'dropped', 'quot', 'Others', 'quot', 'contrast', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'quot', ""'re"", 'leading', 'up', 'big', 'shocker', 'ending', 'quot', 'lead-up', 'plot', 'movie', 'when', ""n't"", 'seem', 'very', 'original', 'even', 'scary.Decent', 'opening', 'bad', 'payoff']",The Others

Well, quite right, and THE OTHERS is an effective illustration of that truth.Grace, played by Nicole Kidman, is the mistress of a gloomy old pile of a mansion on the British island of Jersey very soon after the end of World War II. Her husband, of His Majesty's Army, was, or maybe wasn't, killed during the conflict. Grace's children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), ostensibly have a fatal hypersensitivity to sunlight, which means that heavy drapes must always be drawn over the windows of the rooms they're occupying. To make matters worse, the electricity isn't working - the effects of the war and German occupation, you know - so lots of candle wax gets burned.The movie opens as three former servants of the house, employed there before Grace's ownership, gain re-employment. They're led by the kind and imperturbable Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan). The three are witness to the family's increasing awareness of mysterious household ""intruders"", which open curtains, play the piano, and rumble about in upstairs rooms. Ghosts, perhaps? They remain unseen to Grace and Nicholas, the epitome of a frightened young boy, but are regularly observed by the sassy older sibling, Anne. And there's more than just a little mother-daughter friction, not helped by the fact that Anne is not shy about telling the help that Mom recently went crazy.The trepidation that builds in this very atmospheric film is not due to any overt horrors. There are no skeletons or mutilated bodies falling out of closets. No ghastly spirits go ""boo"" from around dim corners, and no razor-sharp knives flash from behind curtains to carve up unsuspecting flesh in the middle of the night. Rather, the suspense builds slowly in the flickering candlelight, in a house surrounded by an interminable mist, and in the mind of an increasingly agitated Grace. Both she and the audience know something is amiss, but what could it be? And what's with those old pictures of posed dead people lying about?Kidman is superb as the edgy Grace, and Mann, a new face to this moviegoer, is great fun as the feisty Anne. Despite that, THE OTHERS is one of those movies about which I felt ambiguous up until the end, at which time I suddenly became a big fan and said ""Wow!"" I would pay to see it a second time just to revel again in the delight of watching the perspective suddenly flip.

It is one of few movies made recently that relies almost entirely on suspense to be scary.  That may be a downside to this movie, in that it is almost entirely suspenseful until the very end.  The ending was one of the most intense scenes I can remember in a mainstream Hollywood movie.  The other bad thing about this type of movie is that it is only good to watch twice, since it is fairly slow.  Once to watch it, and then once again to catch the foreshadowing.  After that, there really isn't that much else to watch it again to see.  I recommend this movie as one of the scariest I've seen lately, and well acted, but it is not worth seeing more than twice.

There were times the pace was a bit slow, but it was only to give more shape to the plot, and I found all of those scenes interesting. Nicole Kidman gave a stunning performance as a religious, over protective mother of two young children who are resistant to any kind of light other than candle light. The 2 children in this movie are wonderful, and truly did very well. The remaining cast were also great. A movie with a completely great cast? Yep! The Others is a movie you can't give too much plot detail of, for it would ruin the entire thing. Therefore, this is going to be a pretty short review. But I must say, the ending is one to make you gasp or have to rethink the whole movie over. I wish I could talk more and more about The Others, but I would end up giving the whole thing away.

544554,A2NBOL825B93OM,B00003CYLJ,J R Zullo,"[4, 5]","In my opinion ""The others"" is the apotheosis of thrillers. I don't understand why people say it's a bad, boring and predictable movie, when it's clearly not. I'll make a little list of what thriller movies supposedly should have, and then I'll contradict the major complaints about this movie. Let's see:1) Haunted house - all good thrillers should have a closed environment, or induce a claustrophobic feeling in the viewers. ""The others"" have, and ""The others"" do. This movie's location is a mansion in a british island, always surrounded by a gray, wet, spooky mist. And the fact that all courtains have to be closed at all times gives the plot this dark and claustrophobic aura. Perfect.2) Spooky characters - The servants and the husband who's back from the war display no emotion at all, and leave the viewer with a feeling that they know a lot more than what they disclose to the main characters.3) Strange children - Two children who are fotosensitive and who cannot leave their house. On top of that, they start to ""receive"" the visite of another, invisible child.4) A beautiful woman - Hitchock always cast a beautiful woman on his films. It grips the attention, at least of the masculine part of the audience. In fact, Nicole Kidman, as the mother of the children and lady of the house, looks so much like Grace Kelly that I can only see it as a homage to the great master of suspense. She's incredibly beautiful, and very talented as well, as the paranoid mom and harsh mistress of her servants.5) Pianos, paintings and furniture - The classic scenes where the piano plays by itself, spooky paintings and manequins, furniture changing places and the dreary curtains.There's more, but I think it's enough. Now on to the list of complaints.A) ""The plot is dull and boring"". - If you wanted to get spooked every 30 seconds, then go to a Virginia forest alone without an electric light at one in the morning. ""The others"" provides few junp scenes, but when they come they are good. And if you can't enjoy the plot of a movie as a means to create an atmosphere, than go watch Freddy Kruger, Jason - Friday 13, etc.B) ""The children and the mother are annoying"" - Of course they are. They're children. And the mom's a total paranoia freak. She lost her husband in the war. Her house is haunted. Her children are sick. She couldn't be smiling and picking flowers in the garden all the time.C) ""I could see the final twist coming from a mile away"" - No you couldn't. If ten people say that, eight are lying. They just want to be cool. The final twist is very good and the whole movie builds greatly up to these final moments.D) ""The sixth sense is much better"" - Why? What is so different about these two movies? Pay close attention. In ""The sixth sense"" there are very few jumps scenes also, and the whole movie is very slow too, not to mention other similarities.So, ""The others"" has everything a good thriller should have, and add to that the competent direction of Alejandro Amenabar and the always imposing presence of Nicole Kidman. A very effective movie, that won't easily be away from your mind once you see it. In fact, just to raise all this discussion already is proof of a good production.Grade 9.2/10",5,Stick with me,1057536000,"07 7, 2003",2003,3217,"['opinion', 'others', 'apotheosis', 'thrillers', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'say', 'bad', 'boring', 'predictable', 'movie', 'when', 'clearly', 'not', ""'ll"", 'make', 'little', 'list', 'what', 'thriller', 'movies', 'supposedly', 'should', 'have', 'then', ""'ll"", 'contradict', 'major', 'complaints', 'movie', 'Let', 'see:1', 'Haunted', 'house', 'good', 'thrillers', 'should', 'have', 'closed', 'environment', 'induce', 'claustrophobic', 'feeling', 'viewers', 'others', 'have', 'others', 'do', 'movie', 'location', 'mansion', 'british', 'island', 'always', 'surrounded', 'gray', 'wet', 'spooky', 'mist', 'fact', 'courtains', 'have', 'be', 'closed', 'times', 'plot', 'dark', 'claustrophobic', 'aura', 'Perfect.2', 'Spooky', 'characters', 'servants', 'husband', 'who', 'back', 'war', 'display', 'emotion', 'leave', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'know', 'lot', 'more', 'what', 'disclose', 'main', 'characters.3', 'Strange', 'children', 'Two', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'fotosensitive', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'leave', 'house', 'top', 'start', 'receive', 'visite', 'invisible', 'child.4', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'Hitchock', 'always', 'cast', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'films', 'attention', 'least', 'masculine', 'part', 'audience', 'fact', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'mother', 'children', 'lady', 'house', 'so', 'much', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'can', 'only', 'see', 'homage', 'great', 'master', 'suspense', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'very', 'talented', 'well', 'paranoid', 'mom', 'harsh', 'mistress', 'servants.5', 'Pianos', 'paintings', 'furniture', 'classic', 'scenes', 'where', 'piano', 'plays', 'spooky', 'paintings', 'manequins', 'furniture', 'changing', 'places', 'dreary', 'curtains.There', 'more', 'think', 'enough', 'Now', 'list', 'complaints.A', 'plot', 'dull', 'boring', 'wanted', 'get', 'spooked', '30', 'seconds', 'then', 'go', 'Virginia', 'forest', 'alone', 'electric', 'light', 'one', 'morning', 'others', 'few', 'junp', 'scenes', 'when', 'come', 'are', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'plot', 'movie', 'create', 'atmosphere', 'go', 'watch', 'Freddy', 'Kruger', 'Jason', 'Friday', '13', 'etc.B', 'children', 'mother', 'are', 'annoying', 'course', 'are', ""'re"", 'children', 'mom', 'total', 'paranoia', 'freak', 'lost', 'husband', 'war', 'house', 'haunted', 'children', 'are', 'sick', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'smiling', 'picking', 'flowers', 'garden', 'time.C', 'could', 'see', 'final', 'twist', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'could', ""n't"", 'ten', 'people', 'say', 'eight', 'are', 'lying', 'just', 'want', 'be', 'cool', 'final', 'twist', 'very', 'good', 'whole', 'movie', 'builds', 'greatly', 'final', 'moments.D', 'sixth', 'sense', 'much', 'better', 'Why', 'What', 'so', 'different', 'two', 'movies', 'Pay', 'close', 'attention', 'sixth', 'sense', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'jumps', 'scenes', 'also', 'whole', 'movie', 'very', 'slow', 'too', 'not', 'mention', 'other', 'similarities.So', 'others', 'everything', 'good', 'thriller', 'should', 'have', 'add', 'competent', 'direction', 'Alejandro', 'Amenabar', 'always', 'imposing', 'presence', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'very', 'effective', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'easily', 'be', 'away', 'mind', 'see', 'fact', 'just', 'raise', 'discussion', 'already', 'proof', 'good', 'production.Grade', '9.2/10']",The Others

The setting for the story is a huge old manor house that's located on an island off the coast of England. The inhabitants are a young mother (Nicole Kidman) and her daughter and son. The house is already sinister enough, but the curtains are closed all day because both of the children have a condition that makes them sensitive to light. The time is the year 1945 and the father has gone to fight in the war and not returned. The film begins with Grace, the mother hiring three new servants because the old ones have disappeared. After a period of time strange things begin to happen, and the terror begins.I watched this film with seven others.  One kept her eyes shut and jumped at every sound. We all thought that Nicole Kidman did a great job, and all of us thoroughly enjoyed this REALLY good scary story.llent movie. Scary?

That's why I hesitated to see it.I'm glad curiosity got the best of me, and I managed not to spill my popcorn, because I ate it before the movie.Grace (Nicole Kidman) is a stunning Grace Kelly look alike. She's spectacular as the anxiety-ridden mother of two young children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley). Both have a disease which afflicts them fatally if they're subjected to daylight. The time period is 1940s post WWII.Grace takes the children to the family's dilapidated countryside mansion on one of the Channel Islands, to wait for her husband, Charles (Christoper Eccleston), to return from the war.Continuous fog, no electricity, curtains always drawn, and every door to be shut and locked are only a few of the effects to flavor this story.A large mansion needs servants, of course. In this story there are three strange servants, Ms. Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes) and Lydia (Elaine Cassidy).The entire cast is excellent and convincing.

The only reason why I watched this movie is because the advertisement on television looked interesting. Once I saw this film, complete with the impressive scenes they showed on TV to hook potential watchers, that's when I discovered it to be ""typical"".While Nicole Kidman and the two young children played their roles well, Bertha Mills made me suspicious. By WWII, they weren't even wearing the late 19th Century servant's clothing. Bertha refused to post Grace's letter, helped the gardener cover the ground with leaves, and encouraged Anne to talk about her suspicions. The mute woman was the only one that looked right in what she wore.While Grace tried to fool her daughter into believing that all bad children spend eternity in limbo, Anne got wise to this, read the Bible, and found out differently. If Anne weren't baptised, how could she go to her first communion in the Catholic church? Better yet, how could her mother finish the last part of her head dress in good conciousness?Anne kept telling her mother that there were ghosts in the house, but her mother and her brother refused to believe her but the thought still scared them both. Bertha didn't seem to discourage such talk, except in the presence of Grace, her employer.It wasn't until the psychic lady found the children hiding in the wardrobe that things started to unravel. That was the only scene that made me jump. But the mystery disappeared when Grace found a few choice items in an unused portion of the house.I don't mean to discourage others from renting this movie, but if you are expecting a lot, you will be disappointed.

I wasn't prepared for the ending, so that was a surprise as well.The basic premise of the movie? Grace (played by Nicole Kidman) is living in a house with her 2 children, awaiting the return of her husband who is lost at war. Her children can't be exposed to light and so the curtains must be kept closed - which only adds to the dark and foreboding atmosphere.  The children are hypersensitive to light and have lived in a musty manor with curtains and shutters perpetually drawn.Grace's daughter keeps speaking of a child she sees and of other ghosts as well, bringing about her mother's wrath - until slowly, slowly, it becomes clear that something strange is going on in the house. But what? I won't give away any of the important details but I WILL say that this one may not go in a totally expected direction so don't assume you know the ending until the last few minutes.

544566,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B00003CYLJ,K. Driscoll,"[12, 13]","The Others is a psychological thriller set in a haunted house, so don't let the PG-13 rating fool you, this is a hardcore old style horror film.  It is far more of a horror film than the blood-soaked money-making trash infiltrating our beloved cinemas every weekend and harkens back in spirit to supernatural classics likeThe HauntingandThe Changeling, which I would also recommend.Two important things make The Others special.  Firstly, the mystery element is so powerful that it is a hard film to watch without finishing.  As a lover of horror films I've always felt that horror without mystery descends to madness, and other than for getting a good chuckle while disturbing your wife I would see little reason to watch a movie like that.  Gore can work in the right hands but it is rarely a necessity for something to scare this viewer.  What is necessary for me is surprise, which The Others is chock full of.  It is a smart film.  Secondly, another incredibly important element to all films for me is characters that work.  That kind of thing requires success on a number of fronts; namely the screenplay, and the actors, but here the cinematography, music, and art direction are just as crucial.  It is no coincidence that one mind directed this film in every way as almost every element mends together perfectly.  Tom Cruise may have been a producer but he clearly kept his Hollywood ego in check and let director Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar (Open Your Eyes) run this show his way and his way alone, even if it meant turning Cruise's then-wife into an emotional wreck in doing so.  Nicole Kidman was very possibly driven temporarily insane while starring in almost every frame of this movie and looking exhausted as she seems to consume herself in the role.  An underrated virtuoso performance for sure in a film that constantly appears alarmingly isolated.  I get exhausted for her while watching The Others unfold.There are so many potentially devastating spoilers to mention in The Others and for those who haven't seen it I should tread carefully.  The film is set in a giant house in the Bailiwick of Jersey (a Crown dependency off the coast of Normandy), but I'm not sure if it's the main island or not.  It certainly appears isolated enough not to be, and really the house and its vast foggy property are all we have for a setting in The Others anyhow.  The film takes place just after World War II.  A family of three; Grace (Kidman) and her two children Anne and Nicholas, wait with little hope in their home for Charles, their husband and father, to return from the war.  The children have a unique condition that makes them extremely sensitive to sunlit, perhaps even allergic.  Their home's light is constantly being carefully controlled and maintained, making for an effective atmosphere of both vulnerability and isolation.  I'm sure that the controlled light inside and the surrounding fog of suffocation outside made the film's cinematography an exciting task and Javier Aguirresarobe delivers quite nicely.  The house is soon visited by three new servants and the story goes forward with many exciting twists and turns.As a bit of a horror movie snob I'm going to recommend The Others twice.  Another look after you know the twists is definitely worthwhile.  Everything comes together just right for the sake of giving us a little scare and some fun surprises.

544571,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B00003CYLJ,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[3, 7]","This movie is an example of the type critic Pauline Kael describes as a &quot;Boo Movie.&quot;  The handle refers to the fact that, intermittently, monsters jump out, yell &quot;Boo,&quot; and then return back to the woodwork from whence they came.The first problem is that the movie is set in 1945 a house on the island of Jersey, one of the Channel Islands that belongs nominally to England, is set just off the shores of France, and is functionally independent.  This choice of setting appears to be an attempt to emulate classic movies like &#65533;Rebecca.&#65533;  The problem is that &#65533;Rebecca&#65533; was set in what was then a contemporary atmosphere.  Placing the action on an island few people will ever see, at a time more than half a century removed, enables the casual viewer to keep events at arm&#65533;s length, unaffected.Nicole Kidman, the graceful and stunningly attractive redhead who was the basic reason anybody went to see &#65533;Moulin Rouge,&#65533; stars as Grace, a wife and mother who&#65533;s lived in isolation in her sprawling mansion ever since her husband went to France to fight in the war.  Though the war in Europe is over, her husband still hasn&#65533;t come home, but she steadfastly refuses to give up hope.  Her two children, however, are convinced they&#65533;re going to live the rest of their lives in this sepulchral, unlit building.Are we supposed to believe that Kidman, who has a waist like my ankle, is the mother of two children as old as the kids in the movie?  Kidman and her ex-husband Tom Cruise are the adoptive parents of two young children, but most women who have given birth twice, and have children as old as these, have figures that reflect that fact.  I for one wouldn&#65533;t mind seeing a woman with such a figure cast in the lead of a movie, as I find that figure attractive.  But Kidman, who is extremely thin and graceful, simply doesn&#65533;t look like a mother of two.Grace&#65533;s children suffer from a rare (and very real) disorder that causes them to suffer severe burns, asphyxiation, and other gruesome symptoms on exposure to bright light.  Left to itself, the disorder will eventually result in the children&#65533;s death.  This plot twist is interesting and offers a few material contributions to the storyline, but essentially, its purpose is as a macguffin to keep most of the house as dark as possible for as much of the movie as possible.The movie tries to move through a series of suspenseful interludes, complete with a few red herrings designed to throw viewers who aren&#65533;t paying exacting attention off the true path.  The effect isn&#65533;t what the director had in mind, and where there is anything scary, it tends to be more startling than deep-seatedly frightening.  Slamming doors, unexpected music, moving furniture, and more seem to be contrived to make viewers jump out of their seats, but fail to establish a necessary environment of underlying dread.The hired help, three people of mysterious background who simply show up one day and get hired that quickly, serve to create interplay and tension.  By showing us scraps of their conversations and giving us hints at unseen actions, we are led to think that they are trying to manipulate Grace and her children, in the style of Mrs. Danvers, the housekeeper from &#65533;Rebecca.&#65533;  However, we see such short snippets of the characters that we get no real feel for them, nor do we understand why they&#65533;re doing anything they do.  This undercuts the desired tension, leaving us with a trio of characters who say one thing, do another, and serve still another purpose in the plot.  Indeed, some of the shots featuring these characters seem designed to willfully deceive us as to who they are.  Red herrings are fine and most critics appreciate them, but we are simply lied to as to what these characters are about, setting us up for a payoff that never comes.The movie prides itself of its surprise ending.  This is fine, except that it&#65533;s not a surprise.  Because it&#65533;s deeply reminiscent of another recent movie (I won&#65533;t say which in case some reader of this review is actually going to be startled), careful viewers see it coming well in advance, and it actually serves as something of a letdown.  What tension is built up through the course of the movie is never effectively released, and viewers who are accustomed to horror in the style of Daphne du Maurier, whom the movie&#65533;s creators seem to be consciously imitating, will be disappointed.In total, the movie is adequate, creating a few startled squeals and a few jumps from the seat.  However, it fails to create the desired dread seasoned suspense fans have grown to appreciate, and the setup fails to equal the payoff.  The creators of this movie seem to be testing the water for a more mature, sophisticated attempt at horror later; here&#65533;s hoping that, next time, they pay less attention to dress-up atmospherics and more to the actual events that cause us to feel fear.",3,Adequate but Forced,998006400,"08 17, 2001",2001,5039,"['movie', 'example', 'type', 'critic', 'Pauline', 'Kael', 'quot', 'Boo', 'Movie.',

I had read so much on how well Kidman did in this movie, and I agree she showed acting abilities that I had not often seen from her before. But the whole movie seemed way too familiar...like not only had I seen it before, but I also had read it before. Several family members sat together and watched this movie, and we were expecting a lot. But all of us knew what the ending was going to be before we got to it (and none of us had seen or read anything about the ending). So it was a bit of a disappointment. It was a more stylized version of the Sixth Sense, without the 'fear factor' involved.Though Kidman and the other adults were well acted, the children left a bit to be desired. Whether this was the kids' fault or the fault of the directors, I have no idea. So many people came out and said that this movie was going to become a classic...is that just because the abilities of our directors/producers are not as good as in the past (with Hitchcock and others) that movies without obvious violence, gore, etc. cannot reach the previous level that those directors met in the past...that we are settling for 'classics' which are not as good?If this movie had come out prior to The Sixth Sense, I think I would have liked it more...but it didn't...and I don't!Karen Sadler",4,It was too familiar...,1023321600,"06 6, 2002",2002,1321,"['was', 'deeply', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'had', 'read', 'so', 'much', 'how', 'well', 'Kidman', 'did', 'movie', 'agree', 'showed', 'acting', 'abilities', 'had', 'not', 'often', 'seen', 'before', 'whole', 'movie', 'seemed', 'way', 'too', 'familiar', 'not', 'only', 'had', 'seen', 'also', 'had', 'read', 'Several', 'family', 'members', 'sat', 'together', 'watched', 'movie', 'were', 'expecting', 'lot', 'knew', 'what', 'ending', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'got', 'none', 'had', 'seen', 'read', 'anything', 'ending', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointment', 'was', 'more', 'stylized', 'version', 'Sixth', 'Sense', ""'fear"", 'factor', 'involved.Though', 'Kidman', 'other', 'adults', 'were', 'well', 'acted', 'children', 'left', 'bit', 'be', 'desired', 'was', 'kids', 'fault', 'fault', 'directors', 'have', 'idea', 'So', 'many', 'people', 'came', 'out', 'said', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'become', 'classic', 'just', 'abilities', 'directors/producers', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'past', 'Hitchcock', 'others', 'movies', 'obvious', 'violence', 'gore', 'etc', 'can', 'not', 'reach', 'previous', 'level', 'directors', 'met', 'past', 'are', 'settling', ""'classics"", 'are', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'had', 'come', 'out', 'prior', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'Karen', 'Sadler']",The Others

Lovely Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, the nervous and rigid mother of Charles and Anne, who are so allergic to light that their home must be kept in darkness. Although WWII has ended, Grace's husband has not yet come home, and she is just about at her wit's end, trying to cope with the children and the big, dark, isolated house. Suddenly, three decidedly odd and grave-looking servants arrive to join the household. And then Anne claims she has seen a ghost in the house, and his name is Victor.There is so much tension in every step that Grace takes while searching for Victor in that spooky house, that you will be on the edge of your seat, and the icy-cold music increases the chills. Kidman, in her best role to date, gives a remarkable performance, painting a portrait of fear, then horror, and madness. The children are both suitably creepy and Fionnula Flanagan, as the housekeeper, is a wonderful mix of kindly servant and terrifying specter. This is a truly well-written film with a clever twist at the end that will surprise you.

544590,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00003CYLJ,Lawyeraau,"[0, 0]","This is a superb, atmospheric ghost story that will have the viewer thinking right from the get go. There are things afoot here that go bump in the night, but it may not be what the viewer thinks.On the Isle of Jersey, during the last days of World War II, a lovely, isolated mansion sits in the shrouding mists. The house is adequately, though sparsely, furnished. It is occupied by a mother, Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman), and her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley). The children are afflicted with a great sensitivity to light, so much so that they must, at all times, have the curtains drawn and the shutters closed. Grace's husband, the children's father, had left them to fight in the war. This is a perfect and stark setting for what is to come.One day, three strangers arrive on her doorstep. Grace presumes that they are there in response to her post for domestic help and hires Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), Edmund Tuttle (Eric Sykes), and Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) on the spot. Grace instructs them on the idiosyncratic ways she has of handling her children's sensitivities to light. It soon becomes clear, however, that this triumvirate has their own agenda and are not strangers to this house.Nicole Kidman give a remarkable performance in this film. Tightly wound and controlling, she appears to be a woman on the brink of a breakdown, holding herself together only by a great effort of will, as she awaits her husband's return. Her performance as a lonely wife and seemingly protective mother contributes greatly to the tense and suspenseful atmosphere in the household. While I am not generally a fan of Ms. Kidman's, finding her ice maiden demeanor to be too cool for my tastes, even I must agree that her performance in this film is superlative and contributes greatly to its overall success.The children both give excellent performances. It is the young boy, James Bentley, however, who deserves special mention. He shines in the role of Nicholas, giving a sensitive performance that conveys his pervasive fear of what seems to be going on in the household. It is a poignant and moving performance that will capture the viewer's heart.Christopher Eccleston is marvelous in the role of Grace's husband and the children's father, who returns all too briefly, like a deus ex machina, conveying an infinite and bittersweet sadness that only adds to the disturbing portents that seem to be gathering about the Stewart household. Eccleston is an outstanding actor who manages to contribute greatly to the film in this small, but pivotal, role.It is, however, Fionnula Flanagan in the role of the mysterious housekeeper, Bertha Mills, who steals the show. She is like the voice crying in the wilderness to those who will not hear her message. Strong and commanding in her performance, it is she, and not Nicole Kidman, who is the backbone of this film. Her presence lends such an eerie and discordant note, that one feels her presence to be that of a harbinger of doom. Yet, things are not all that they seem in this household, as the ending has a surprising twist to it.This wonderful and highly atmospheric ghost story is one that is sure to delight those appreciative of this genre of film. Intelligent and finely crafted, it reveals an eerie story borne of psychological despair and horror. Beautifully directed by Alejandro Amenabar, it succeeds where others have failed. Relying on well nuanced moments, rather than grotesque special effects, this is a film that is sure to withstand the test of time and emerge as a classic.",5,A THINKING PERSON'S GHOST STORY...,1166745600,"12 22, 2006",2006,3572,"['superb', 'atmospheric', 'ghost', 'story', 'will', 'have', 'viewer', 'thinking', 'right', 'get', 'go', 'are', 'things', 'afoot', 'here', 'go', 'bump', 'night', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'viewer', 'thinks.On', 'Isle', 'Jersey', 'last', 'days', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'lovely', 'isolated', 'mansion', 'sits', 'shrouding', 'mists', 'house', 'adequately', 'sparsely', 'furnished', 'occupied', 'mother', 'Grace', 'Stewart', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'two', 'children', 'Anne', 'Alakina', 'Mann', 'Nicholas', 'James', 'Bentley', 'children', 'are', 'afflicted', 'great', 'sensitivity', 'light', 'so', 'much', 'must', 'times', 'have', 'curtains', 'drawn', 'shutters', 'closed', 'Grace', 'husband', 'children', 'father', 'had', 'left', 'fight', 'war', 'perfect', 'stark', 'setting', 'what', 'come.One', 'day', 'three', 'strangers', 'arrive', 'doorstep', 'Grace', 'are', 'there', 'response', 'post', 'domestic', 'help', 'Bertha', 'Mills', 'Fionnula', 'Flanagan', 'Edmund', 'Tuttle', 'Eric', 'Sykes', 'Lydia', 'Elaine', 'Cassidy', 'spot', 'Grace', 'idiosyncratic', 'ways', 'handling', 'children', 'sensitivities', 'light', 'soon', 'clear', 'however', 'triumvirate', 'own', 'agenda', 'are', 'not', 'strangers', 'house.Nicole', 'Kidman', 'give', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'film', 'Tightly', 'controlling', 'be', 'woman', 'brink', 'breakdown', 'holding', 'together', 'only', 'great', 'effort', 'will', 'husband', 'return', 'performance', 'lonely', 'wife', 'seemingly', 'protective', 'mother', 'greatly', 'tense', 'suspenseful', 'atmosphere', 'household', 'am', 'not', 'generally', 'fan', 'Ms.', 'Kidman', 'finding', 'ice', 'maiden', 'demeanor', 'be', 'too', 'cool', 'tastes', 'even', 'must', 'agree', 'performance', 'film', 'superlative', 'greatly', 'overall', 'success.The', 'children', 'give', 'excellent', 'performances', 'young', 'boy', 'James', 'Bentley', 'however', 'who', 'special', 'mention', 'role', 'Nicholas', 'giving', 'sensitive', 'performance', 'pervasive', 'fear', 'what', 'be', 'going', 'household', 'poignant', 'moving', 'performance', 'will', 'capture', 'viewer', 'heart.Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'marvelous', 'role', 'Grace', 'husband', 'children', 'father', 'who', 'too', 'briefly', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'conveying', 'infinite', 'bittersweet', 'sadness', 'only', 'disturbing', 'portents', 'seem', 'be', 'gathering', 'Stewart', 'household', 'Eccleston', 'outstanding', 'actor', 'who', 'contribute', 'greatly', 'film', 'small', 'pivotal', 'role.It', 'however', 'Fionnula', 'Flanagan', 'role', 'mysterious', 'housekeeper', 'Bertha', 'Mills', 'who', 'show', 'voice', 'crying', 'wilderness', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'hear', 'message', 'Strong', 'commanding', 'performance', 'not', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'who', 'backbone', 'film', 'presence', 'lends', 'such', 'eerie', 'discordant', 'note', 'one', 'presence', 'be', 'harbinger', 'doom', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'seem', 'household', 'ending', 'surprising', 'twist', 'it.This', 'wonderful', 'highly', 'atmospheric', 'ghost', 'story', 'one', 'sure', 'delight', 'appreciative', 'genre', 'film', 'Intelligent', 'finely', 'crafted', 'eerie', 'story', 'borne', 'psychological', 'despair', 'horror', 'Beautifully', 'directed', 'Alejandro', 'Amenabar', 'where', 'others', 'have', 'failed', 'Relying', 'well', 'nuanced', 'moments', 'rather', 'grotesque', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'sure', 'withstand', 'test', 'time', 'emerge', 'classic']",The Others

Nicole Kidman is Nicole Kidman, she functions well in a movie like this, as a very religious (often telling them things such as ""If you're bad you'll go to limbo"" to keep them in line) mother whom has to teach her children at home because of their unique condition.  The movie more relies less on special effects and more on atmosphere, and a sort of disconcerting feeling that we really do not know what is happening most of the time.  Back when I saw this in the theaters with my best friend at the time, we screamed our heads off at certain parts, we provided more than a few good scares.

The atmosphere of the film is more gothic --say, along the lines of Rebecca, My Cousin Rachel or even Wuthering Heights (minus the romance) than modern horror with the emphasis on blood, special effects and stacks of butchered teenagers. Nicole Kidman is brilliant as a high-strung woman living in an isolated, eerie old house with her two sheltered children. When three new servants arrive, spooky things begin to occur. There are also intimations of tragic events in the past which are not revealed until the end. This film is a welcome alternative to the Friday the 13th variety of horror movie. It allows us to use our imagination rather than overwhelming us with gore. A sense of dread persists, mainly revealed in small things like an old photo album or a foggy path in the woods.

In a non-conventional script that reminds us of what a brilliant writer he is, he presents a family of three, a mother (Kidman in another impeccable performance) and her two kids, ""trapped"" inside a house, where the curtains must remain closed at all times to shut the light out, since the kids suffer from a critical condition that makes them fatally alergic to it. As three new servants knock on their door to offer their services, their lives take a weird twist that not even the savviest moviegoers can expect.The brilliance of Amenabar as writer and director is complemented by the music (also composed by him), which helps to set the tone for the normally dark shots. In the end, the movie opens up (like Amenabar has us used to) a whole can of worms, where life and death are inextricably tied to each other, and viewers are struck with the realization that truly we as humans have not yet learned our lesson as to how to cope with the deaths of our loved ones, much less when they happen under tragic circumstances. A must see, and an instant timeless suspense classic which will continue to be viewed by generations to come.",5,Amenabar does it again... and Nicole Kidman too,1052611200,"05 11, 2003",2003,1360,"['two', 'most', 'brilliant', 'movies', 'Thesis', 'Open', 'Eyes', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'was', 'based', 'off', 'Chilean-born', 'Spanish', 'director', 'Alejandro', 'Amenabar', 'back', 'eye-opener', 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'non-conventional', 'script', 'what', 'brilliant', 'writer', 'family', 'three', 'mother', 'Kidman', 'impeccable', 'performance', 'two', 'kids', 'trapped', 'house', 'where', 'curtains', 'must', 'remain', 'closed', 'times', 'shut', 'light', 'out', 'kids', 'suffer', 'critical', 'condition', 'fatally', 'three', 'new', 'servants', 'knock', 'door', 'offer', 'services', 'lives', 'take', 'weird', 'twist', 'not', 'even', 'savviest', 'moviegoers', 'can', 'expect.The', 'brilliance', 'Amenabar', 'writer', 'director', 'complemented', 'music', 'also', 'composed', 'set', 'tone', 'normally', 'dark', 'shots', 'end', 'movie', 'up', 'Amenabar', 'used', 'whole', 'can', 'worms', 'where', 'life', 'death', 'are', 'inextricably', 'tied', 'other', 'viewers', 'are', 'struck', 'realization', 'truly', 'humans', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'learned', 'lesson', 'how', 'cope', 'deaths', 'loved', 'ones', 'much', 'less', 'when', 'happen', 'tragic', 'circumstances', 'must', 'see', 'instant', 'timeless', 'suspense', 'classic', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'viewed', 'generations', 'come']",The Others
544602,A1M82Z8DQG4IMA,B00003CYLJ,"Margaret Bauer ""hoodsportjo""","[0, 0]","""The Others"" is an excellent ghost story set in an atmosphere of post WWII. The main characters are: a large country house, mother with two light-allergic children, mysterious housekeeper, mute girl, strange and allusive father, and old gardener. The suspense does build and does not fail to surprise. I had trouble concentrating on my popcorn. Hey, I am used to modern technology with all of the special effects, noise, blood, computerized actions, and semi-animated sequences. None of that for us. This was just a good old-fashioned scary story, right? Basically its a study in contrasts. Dark house vs non-electric lamps, gray tombstones covered with colorful autumn leaves, whispering vs screaming. At first I thought the management had forgotten to turn up the sound until I realized it was supposed to be that way. But we did NOTICE the screaming. Once I was so frightened I almost beat the characters to it. Tom Cruise produced it; but this film goes beyond being a vehicle for his ex-wife, Nicole Kidmon. It reminded me somewhat of ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muier, Portrait of Jenny, and the Haunting(Julie Harris one) and measures up to modern gems like ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Ghost"" (without the comic relief). Kidman is stretched beyond her capacity in this finely directed film, but I think the director did the very best with what he had. The other performances shine, especially the stoic housekeeper, and the little boy. The girl's not bad either. I especially noticed a great moment when the housekeeper's mute daughter struggles to speak. Remember Dorothy McGuire in ""The Spiral Staircase""? Questions abound working there way to resolution. What is the mother really afraid of? What secrets do the staff keep hidden? Why doesn't everyone see the boy, Victor? What is that noise upstairs? Why does the father want to return to the front when the war(WWII) is over? Whose names are on those graves? What do we really believe about life hereafter? And really, who are the OTHERS? The OTHERS did not disappoint me. I found it well worth the price. It's a must-see in its cinematic excellence. You too will be frightened and amazed at the surprising ending which even I, though a buff of the genre for 45 years who figured out the ending to ""The Sixth Sense"" early on didn't get until the very last.

The Others, without offering up a spoiler, starts out necessarily slow and builds up to what I consider one of the best ghost stories to hit theaters in many many years. Just enough twists and turns. There was potential for this to be a bomb (just add Keanu Reeves to the cast...don't worry he's not in this one), but there was so much care and atmosphere added to the project (location, cast, crew,etc...) that suspension of disbelief was imminent for the viewer.

That is the question haunting the audience through most of this elegant, sophisticated, and scary gothic thriller. The film, from Spanish filmmaker Alejandro Amenabar, takes the ""old dark house"" movie and reinvigorates it through intelligence and imagination. With its star, Nicole Kidman--at her enigmatic, beautiful best--the movie holds you in its clutches from the opening moment, when Kidman's troubled character awakens in bed with a terrifying scream, and doesn't let go until the final twist at the end.The story takes place in the absolute seclusion of a stately, cavernous mansion on the fog-enshrouded Isle of Jersey, the southernmost of Britain's Channel Islands, in the days following the end of World War II. (the entire film was shot in Spain.) Grace (Kidman) lives here with her two young children. All are sadly aware that her husband and their father is not likely to return from the front. Three servants arrive to replace those who have inexplicably disappeared. Everyone tries to settle into a semblance of normalcy, but something is definitely not right. The children suffer from extreme photosensitivity whereby sunlight might kill them. So Grace darkens every room with heavy curtains, using only candles or fireplaces for light. Then, her daughter claims that she has seen and talked to ""intruders."" A deeply religious woman, Grace refuses to believe her ""ghost"" stories. Yet locked doors are discovered open, and a piano bursts into music without a player in sight. A strong sense of foreboding lodges in every shadow and mysterious noise. What caused the original servants to vanish so abruptly? What happened to Mom when she went ""crazy"" a few months ago? And why do the new servants, who claim to have worked at the house years before, exchange oblique references to impending ""changes?""Kidman, coifed and groomed so as to remind you somewhat of Grace Kelly, rules this nightmare with a steely determination to ward off any evil that might threaten her children. But her nerves are quietly going to pieces. Equally as formidable is Fionnula Flanagan's nanny, a strong, no-nonsense presence who also wishes to shelter the children from these intruders.The youngsters are marvelous. Alakina Mann possesses a combination of curiosity and stubborn pride that makes her a constant thorn in her mother's side. James Bentley has large, bewildered eyes that swim in a pasty-white face, a perfect mirror of the audience's increasing anxiety at the super-natural incidents.Elaine Cassidy's (her perormance being one of the few aspects of FELICIA's JOURNEY I actually enjoyed) mute servant girl and Eric Sykes' stolid gardener give the staff a commonplace touch at odds with their often strange demeanor.Directing his own meticulously crafted screenplay, Amenabar manages to craft an intelligent and suspenseful psychological thriller, a rarity these days...",5,Deliciously Creepy!!!,1044230400,"02 3, 2003",2003,2907,"['What', 'exactly', 'are', 'Others', 'question', 'haunting', 'audience', 'most', 'elegant', 'sophisticated', 'scary', 'gothic', 'thriller', 'film', 'Spanish', 'filmmaker', 'Alejandro', 'Amenabar', 'old', 'dark', 'house', 'movie', 'intelligence', 'imagination', 'star', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'enigmatic', 'beautiful', 'best', 'movie', 'clutches', 'opening', 'moment', 'when', 'Kidman', 'troubled', 'character', 'awakens', 'bed', 'terrifying', 'scream', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'final', 'twist', 'end.The', 'story', 'place', 'absolute', 'seclusion', 'stately', 'cavernous', 'mansion', 'fog-enshrouded', 'Isle', 'Jersey', 'southernmost', 'Britain', 'Channel', 'Islands', 'days', 'following', 'end', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Spain', 'Grace', 'Kidman', 'here', 'two', 'young', 'children', 'are', 'sadly', 'aware', 'husband', 'father', 'not', 'likely', 'return', 'front', 'Three', 'servants', 'arrive', 'replace', 'who', 'have', 'inexplicably', 'disappeared', 'Everyone', 'settle', 'semblance', 'normalcy', 'something', 'definitely', 'not', 'right', 'children', 'suffer', 'extreme', 'photosensitivity', 'whereby', 'sunlight', 'might', 'kill', 'So', 'Grace', 'room', 'heavy', 'curtains', 'using', 'only', 'candles', 'fireplaces', 'light', 'Then', 'daughter', 'claims', 'seen', 'talked', 'intruders', 'deeply', 'religious', 'woman', 'Grace', 'believe', 'ghost', 'stories', 'locked', 'doors', 'are', 'discovered', 'open', 'piano', 'music', 'player', 'sight', 'strong', 'sense', 'foreboding', 'lodges', 'shadow', 'mysterious', 'noise', 'What', 'caused', 'original', 'servants', 'vanish', 'so', 'abruptly', 'What', 'happened', 'Mom', 'when', 'went', 'crazy', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'why', 'do', 'new', 'servants', 'who', 'claim', 'have', 'worked', 'house', 'years', 'exchange', 'oblique', 'references', 'impending', 'changes', 'Kidman', 'coifed', 'groomed', 'so', 'remind', 'somewhat', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'rules', 'nightmare', 'steely', 'determination', 'ward', 'off', 'evil', 'might', 'threaten', 'children', 'nerves', 'are', 'quietly', 'going', 'pieces', 'Equally', 'formidable', 'Fionnula', 'Flanagan', 'nanny', 'strong', 'no-nonsense', 'presence', 'who', 'also', 'shelter', 'children', 'intruders.The', 'youngsters', 'are', 'marvelous', 'Alakina', 'Mann', 'combination', 'curiosity', 'stubborn', 'pride', 'constant', 'thorn', 'mother', 'side', 'James', 'Bentley', 'large', 'bewildered', 'eyes', 'swim', 'pasty-white', 'face', 'perfect', 'mirror', 'audience', 'increasing', 'anxiety', 'super-natural', 'incidents.Elaine', 'Cassidy', 'perormance', 'being', 'one', 'few', 'aspects', 'FELICIA', 'JOURNEY', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'mute', 'servant', 'girl', 'Eric', 'Sykes', 'stolid', 'gardener', 'give', 'staff', 'commonplace', 'touch', 'odds', 'often', 'strange', 'demeanor.Directing', 'own', 'meticulously', 'crafted', 'screenplay', 'Amenabar', 'craft', 'intelligent', 'suspenseful', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'rarity', 'days']",The Others

She is at the same time beautiful and malevolent, drawing sympathy as well as dis-like. She does a great job of helping to build the tension. The actors who portray the children are solid little performers. Their characters are allergic to light, so they are kept indoors, mostly in the shadows, and so this helps make the mood of the piece even more eerie. Fionnula Flanagan, a relatively unknown (here in the States) Irish actress makes good as Mrs. Mills, one of the new servants.The director also wrote the screenplay, and composed the music.

544609,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CYLJ,Matthew Horner,"[1, 1]","""The Others"" is a superb ghost story with the best twist ending since ""The Sixth Sense"". It has no dazzling special effects. Instead, it relies on atmosphere [darkness and shadows, fog, sounds, a malevolent old house], a literate script and great acting. Because it is somewhat old-fashioned and because its pace isn't lightening fast, it's at least as appealing to adults as it is to teens.Grace Stewart lives in a vast, isolated mansion on an island off the coast of England with her two young children, Anne and Nicholas. Her husband has yet to come home from the recently ended W.W.II. The children have a disease that makes them allergic to bright light. All the curtains must be drawn in any room they are in. Doors must be kept closed. The servants have recently vanished in the night, leaving the high-strung, fanatically religious Grace alone to care for the kids. It is a lonely and claustrophobic existence. Help arrives in the form of three servants who once worked in the house years before the Stewarts moved in. Before long, Anne claims that she's seeing strange people in the house. Grace refuses to believe her until even odder events occur. And the three servants, who at first seemed so kind and caring, become somehow threatening. What on earth is going on? Or is it of this earth?Nicole Kidman is mesmerizing as Grace Stewart. She is in nearly every scene. Her character is a difficult one that vacillates between loving mother and screaming banshee. At the hands of a less accomplished actress, the role might have produced some unintentional laughter, but Ms. Kidman makes us feel empathy and compassion for sad, unhappy Grace. Also of note are Alakina Mann as Anne and Fionula Flanigan as Bertha Mills, one of the mysterious servants.

Instead, it is a classic (and classy) ""haunted house"" movie. THE OTHERS does more scaring with sound and implied camera angles than a slasher flick will ever do.  Its haunted house atmosphere (fog, creaky floors, old rooms) is spooky.  One effective scene involves a glowing, ghostly face that ends up being a painting.The tone is set right away.  Nicole Kidman's character, Grace, shows the new servants around the house.  There are some weird house rules!  Every door must be closed and locked before the next one is opened.  The curtains must be drawn at all times.  Her children are photosensitive, you see, and could erupt in sores and smother to death if exposed to daylight.  Weird.  Kidman plays all her scenes with a wide-eyed neurotic energy - Grace is on the edge!  One wonders how Kidman the actress sustained this type of frenetic energy over the course of the shoot?  She's really good here.THE OTHERS telegraphs its ending by dropping some clues along the way.  I had it figured out. The execution of the revealing scene is very good, though, and still manages to surprise you.I jumped out of my couch several times.

It looks more to be set in the Yorkshire moors, but in reality it was set in Spain! Of course.I'm not sure what I was expecting of this movie. When it started, it reminded me very much of Sixth Sense, and very much of M. Night Shyamalan's camera work, rather than Alejandro Amenabar. (Try saying THAT when you've had a few) As it went on, the whole fog outside the house, and not being able to escape the house/gardens reminded me of Beetlejuice - and again, the Yorkshire moors.Unfortunately (no thanks to a Scottish newspaper) I found out the twist at the end, so I was expecting it, although it wasn't quite what I expected! So at least that was something.I actually wondered after this movie was finished - and after finishing the discussion about what I didn't understand - how much of it was based on real life. As it was set towards the end of World War II, there were many wives wondering if they would see their husbands again - presuming they hadn't already received a telegram saying they were missing. How many wives would subsequently go mad, upon being trapped alone with children, without family around, and the fear of not being able to remarry? (Amazon, I am NOT giving anything away, so do not even start with me!) How many children had to put up with an overbearing, overprotective mother, while wishing they could see their father, and not understanding why he had to go and maybe not come back? Or wishing they could go out in the sunshine?I must say, Nicole Kidman came off very well as a 40s wife - right down to the hairstyle, clothes, and manner. (Although I did find the hairstyle was a little too harsh) She was terrific as Grace, and had great chemistry with the children - although the girl was a little witch at times!What didn't I get about this movie? The servants - how they couldn't come through the door, even after it was explained what they really were, but I suppose that's just too cartoonish maybe? - and the father coming back from the war. What was the point in Christopher Eccleston appearing in the movie for no apparent reason? But you could dig deeper into his whole appearing/disappearing act - and I could, but Amazon would get their red pen out. And I know he's come back from the war and everything, and he's seen some horrific things which he didn't want to talk about, but he could have at least given his wife a kiss! (In this day and age, I probably would have pounced on him, but this is in the 40s) But what I want to know is: did he remove the curtains?! Or did the servants? I found the mute servant's reason for being mute very strange. Surely if it happened to her, it could have happened to the rest of them, after they &quot;found out&quot;.The finale is terrific, and in the scenes leading up to it, I was really, really scared, and looking for someone to hold on to! (A friendly cushion kept me comforted kind of) After the film has finished, you look back on the film in a different light. Although I'll have to re-watch it many times before I get all the clues.As a final note: don't be surprised if the sound isn't that great. I had this turned right up, and I still could only just hear what Nicole was saying. I thought this was a problem with my hearing. But I've read in other reviews, that people have had problems with the sound.

In reality &quot;The Others&quot; is as Amenabar is quoted as saying...&quot;leaving something to the imagination is the essence of real horror.&quot; The year is 1945 and Grace, Nicole Kidman has a lot to be terrified about.  Her children are allergic to the sun and have to be kept in almost complete darkness and her employees have recently departed en masse without an explanation and have left her to run an old, giant, creepy mansion to herself.  Magically 3 former employees of the mansion arrive at her doorstep seeking employment.  But there is still the problem of strange voices and movement in the mansion to be explained.  Along for the ride are the powerful and sturdy Christopher Eccleston as Kidman's husband (excellent in &quot;Jude&quot; and &quot;Elizabeth&quot;) Akima Mann and James Bently as her children and notably Fionnula Flanagan as her new housekeeper and confidant, Mrs. Mills.  Kidman is vulnerable,  high strung and intense as Grace, more like Lady Macbeth than Desdemona.  This is a big departure from her role in &quot;Moulin Rouge.&quot;  Don't expect a &quot;Scream&quot;-like film as this is more in the psychological vein of &quot;Rear Window&quot; or &quot;Vertigo.&quot;  &quot;The Others&quot; is a slow moving adult movie and demands the experience and attitude of an adult to appreciate it.

544621,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B00003CYLJ,Michael Butts,"[0, 1]","It's her eyes.  It's rare for an actress to make such expressive and impressive use of their eyes.  Nicole Kidman does this in ""The Others.""  It reminded me of the underrated Lara Parker (Angelique on the old ""Dark Shadows"" soap).  Ms. Parker also was able to say a million words with those eyes.  Just as Nicole does in this eerily effective thriller.  Alejandro Amenabar's direction is right on target, with the slow, yet tense, pacing; the impeccable cinametography; the great score which Amenabar also wrote; and of course, casting Nicole Kidman in the title role.  We meet Grace as she is awakening from some kind of nightmare, screaming.  The house she lives in is spookier than one would imagine for a ""modern day"" movie.  However, being set in the 1940's, it becomes as integral character as the humans.  Along with Ms. Kidman, Fionnaula Flannagan is superb as the mysterious housekeeper Mrs. Mills.  Also effective is Alikena Mann in the role of Ann, the precocious daughter.  James Bentley as Nicholas is also perfect.  Amenabar manages to meld old-time spook scares with a religiously influenced plot.  Although the ending is telegraphed early on, it's resolution is quite a turn of events.Kidman certainly has proven she can emerge from the shadow of ex-hubby Cruise, and stand on her own as a versatile and talented actress.  She will win an Oscar someday; particularly if she handles roles as magnificently as Grace.RECOMMENDED.",5,THE EYES HAVE IT,1030060800,"08 23, 2002",2002,1442,"['eyes', 'rare', 'actress', 'make', 'such', 'expressive', 'impressive', 'use', 'eyes', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Others', 'reminded', 'underrated', 'Lara', 'Parker', 'Angelique', 'old', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'soap', 'Ms.', 'Parker', 'also', 'was', 'able', 'say', 'million', 'words', 'eyes', 'Just', 'Nicole', 'eerily', 'effective', 'thriller', 'Alejandro', 'Amenabar', 'direction', 'right', 'target', 'slow', 'yet', 'tense', 'pacing', 'impeccable', 'cinametography', 'great', 'score', 'Amenabar', 'also', 'wrote', 'course', 'casting', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'title', 'role', 'meet', 'Grace', 'awakening', 'kind', 'nightmare', 'screaming', 'house', 'spookier', 'one', 'would', 'imagine', 'modern', 'day', 'movie', 'However', 'being', 'set', '1940', 'integral', 'character', 'humans', 'Ms.', 'Kidman', 'Fionnaula', 'Flannagan', 'superb', 'mysterious', 'housekeeper', 'Mrs.', 'Mills', 'Also', 'effective', 'Alikena', 'Mann', 'role', 'Ann', 'precocious', 'daughter', 'James', 'Bentley', 'Nicholas', 'also', 'perfect', 'Amenabar', 'meld', 'old-time', 'spook', 'scares', 'religiously', 'influenced', 'plot', 'ending', 'telegraphed', 'early', 'resolution', 'quite', 'turn', 'events.Kidman', 'certainly', 'proven', 'can', 'emerge', 'shadow', 'ex-hubby', 'Cruise', 'stand', 'own', 'versatile', 'talented', 'actress', 'will', 'win', 'Oscar', 'someday', 'particularly', 'roles', 'as', 'magnificently', 'Grace.RECOMMENDED']",The Others
544622,A3TNI0W7IDS9WG,B00003CYLJ,Michael,"[14, 16]","'The Others' is one of those rare thriller/horror movies that goes for understating rather than overstating the suspense, and in my opinion, the end result is very effective.  An enjoyable movie with great old-fashioned conventions (which avoid playing as tired clich&eacute;s), Nicole Kidman gives an absolutely astonishing performance as a repressed mother, Grace, on the end of her rope.  'The Others' is set immediately after World War II on the secluded (and recently occupied) Isle of Jersey.  The setting is very important in the movie; the monstrous house that Grace and her children occupy is their entire world, trapping them in a claustrophobic (despite the size) and dark place.The premise of the movie is relatively simple: Grace's two children suffer from severe photosensitivity (ie anything beyond the dimmest light can be fatal), and her husband is missing from the war.  Because of this, no door can be open without the previous one first being closed.  Instead of trying to see what's lurking in the corner, Grace tries to hide it.  I won't say anything else, but the movie is full of fun twists and turns that are characteristic of Amen&aacute;bar's movies.Speaking of Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar, the writer, director, *and* composer for the film's score, keep your eye on this guy.  He's only 29, and his previous two films ('Thesis' and 'Open Your Eyes', both in Spanish, which makes his English debut all that much more impressive) are very intelligent and memorable.  His directing in 'The Others' is not flashy, but it's perfect for the gloomy, creeping, gothic feel of the movie.  Any director who can direct a horror movie nowadays without succumbing to the temptations of cheap special effects or PSYCH! scare tactics gets my support, anyway!So, go see 'The Others'.  There's a lot of familiar references in plot and style to other movies, but it's distinct, original, and well worth it in its own right.",5,Elegant and effective,997660800,"08 13, 2001",2001,1931,"['Others', 'one', 'rare', 'thriller/horror', 'movies', 'understating', 'rather', 'overstating', 'suspense', 'opinion', 'end', 'result', 'very', 'effective', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'great', 'old-fashioned', 'conventions', 'avoid', 'playing', 'tired', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'absolutely', 'astonishing', 'performance', 'repressed', 'mother', 'Grace', 'end', 'rope', 'Others', 'set', 'immediately', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'secluded', 'recently', 'occupied', 'Isle', 'Jersey', 'setting', 'very', 'important', 'movie', 'monstrous', 'house', 'Grace', 'children', 'occupy', 'entire', 'world', 'trapping', 'claustrophobic', 'size', 'dark', 'place.The', 'premise', 'movie', 'relatively', 'simple', 'Grace', 'two', 'children', 'suffer', 'severe', 'photosensitivity', 'ie', 'anything', 'dimmest', 'light', 'can', 'be', 'fatal', 'husband', 'missing', 'war', 'door', 'can', 'be', 'open', 'previous', 'one', 'first', 'being', 'closed', 'Instead', 'trying', 'see', 'what', 'lurking', 'corner', 'Grace', 'hide', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'else', 'movie', 'full', 'fun', 'twists', 'turns', 'are', 'characteristic', 'Amen', 'aacute', 'bar', 'movies.Speaking', 'Alejandro', 'Amen', 'aacute', 'bar', 'writer', 'director', '*and*', 'composer', 'film', 'score', 'keep', 'eye', 'guy', 'only', '29', 'previous', 'two', 'films', ""'Open"", 'Eyes', 'Spanish', 'English', 'debut', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'impressive', 'are', 'very', 'intelligent', 'memorable', 'directing', ""'The"", 'Others', 'not', 'flashy', 'perfect', 'gloomy', 'creeping', 'gothic', 'feel', 'movie', 'Any', 'director', 'who', 'can', 'direct', 'horror', 'movie', 'succumbing', 'temptations', 'cheap', 'special', 'effects', 'PSYCH', 'scare', 'tactics', 'support', 'anyway', 'So', 'go', 'see', ""'The"", 'Others', 'lot', 'familiar', 'references', 'plot', 'style', 'other', 'movies', 'distinct', 'original', 'well', 'own', 'right']",The Others

This movie was well done, however, I felt like I was being tortured very slowly over a luke warm fire.I just knew that the story would drop the other shoe at any moment, but it never seemed to deliver. Performances were all very well done by the entire cast. The mansion was spooky, but horribly empty. No woman would live there with her two children, so immediately you are set up knowing the woman was not quite right. Plus, why in the heck would she lock every single door she went through since the kids never seemed to be overly active.I kept trying to figure why she would need to hire servants when it looked like she needed the money to earn money herself, just to buy furniture. That stays in your mind for the first quarter of the movie.

544626,AUSATFDSU2INS,B00003CYLJ,"milss ""Yellow hair warrior""","[0, 0]","A new variation of the classic history of ghosts - an enchanted, solitary and scary house-, returns to the big screen thanks to the excellent hands of director Alejandro Amenabar.Nicole Kidman is Grace, mother of Anne and Nicholas, living in an isolated big house on a European island. The year is 1945 and Grace's husband is fighting against the Nazis in the final days of World War II.The film begins when Grace receives three new servants - a governess, a gardener and a servant who will help at the mansion. Her previous servants went all away; we do not know why.Grace gives few instructions to the help, but the most important thing to do is to keep closed all the doors whenever they change rooms. Apparently, Grace's children suffer a condition that does not allow them to receive sunrays.Thus, the children live without going out, surrounded by shades and candlesticks. Her mother educates them, and many of their lessons are focused on religious values. The children, particularly Anna, feel the presence of other ghostly beings and their actions - doors and windows that are opened without touching them, pianos making music alone.Grace is skeptical in the beginning and does not believe the stories, but it just a matter of time before she's convinced of the reality.Gothic and terrifying, The Others is a thriller that creates a suggestive and dark atmosphere. Supported by the flawless characterizations of the actors and a wonderful script, this film does not rely on the special effects and fast-paced edition that usually defines contemporary terror movies. With genuine moments of terror, Amenabar has constructed a supernatural piece that causes great mental anguish.Nicole Kidman gives a fantastic performance like the rigid and frustrating mother, constantly trying to stay in control of her emotions and to give a logical explanation to all the incomprehensible facts happening before her eyes. Deep down, we see the emotional collapse of a woman forced to accept the destruction of all her beliefs and values.The children are equally memorable in their roles. Next to Kidman, they make us fear everything that hides behind each closed door, the shades rambling in the mansion and the secrets hiding in their corridors.And it's finally when a chilling and unexpected ending is revealed, that The Others smashes us with its impressive weight, disturbing and making us revisit every moment, satisfied for have witnessed such a sublime work.",4,Ghosts without sixth sense,1115942400,"05 13, 2005",2005,2460,"['new', 'variation', 'classic', 'history', 'ghosts', 'enchanted', 'solitary', 'scary', 'house-', 'returns', 'big', 'screen', 'thanks', 'excellent', 'hands', 'director', 'Alejandro', 'Amenabar.Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Grace', 'mother', 'Anne', 'Nicholas', 'living', 'isolated', 'big', 'house', 'European', 'island', 'year', '1945', 'Grace', 'husband', 'fighting', 'Nazis', 'final', 'days', 'World', 'War', 'II.The', 'film', 'when', 'Grace', 'three', 'new', 'servants', 'governess', 'gardener', 'servant', 'who', 'will', 'help', 'mansion', 'previous', 'servants', 'went', 'away', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'why.Grace', 'few', 'instructions', 'help', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'do', 'keep', 'closed', 'doors', 'whenever', 'change', 'rooms', 'Apparently', 'Grace', 'children', 'suffer', 'condition', 'not', 'allow', 'receive', 'sunrays.Thus', 'children', 'live', 'going', 'out', 'surrounded', 'shades', 'candlesticks', 'mother', 'many', 'lessons', 'are', 'focused', 'religious', 'values', 'children', 'particularly', 'Anna', 'feel', 'presence', 'other', 'ghostly', 'beings', 'actions', 'doors', 'windows', 'are', 'opened', 'touching', 'making', 'music', 'alone.Grace', 'skeptical', 'beginning', 'not', 'believe', 'stories', 'just', 'matter', 'time', 'convinced', 'reality.Gothic', 'terrifying', 'Others', 'thriller', 'suggestive', 'dark', 'atmosphere', 'Supported', 'flawless', 'characterizations', 'actors', 'wonderful', 'script', 'film', 'not', 'rely', 'special', 'effects', 'fast-paced', 'edition', 'usually', 'contemporary', 'terror', 'movies', 'genuine', 'moments', 'terror', 'Amenabar', 'constructed', 'supernatural', 'piece', 'great', 'mental', 'anguish.Nicole', 'Kidman', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'rigid', 'frustrating', 'mother', 'constantly', 'trying', 'stay', 'control', 'emotions', 'give', 'logical', 'explanation', 'incomprehensible', 'facts', 'happening', 'eyes', 'Deep', 'down', 'see', 'emotional', 'collapse', 'woman', 'forced', 'accept', 'destruction', 'beliefs', 'values.The', 'children', 'are', 'equally', 'memorable', 'roles', 'Next', 'Kidman', 'make', 'fear', 'everything', 'closed', 'door', 'shades', 'rambling', 'mansion', 'secrets', 'hiding', 'corridors.And', 'finally', 'when', 'chilling', 'unexpected', 'ending', 'revealed', 'Others', 'smashes', 'impressive', 'weight', 'disturbing', 'making', 'revisit', 'moment', 'satisfied', 'have', 'witnessed', 'sublime', 'work']",The Others

Set in 1945 on the island of Jersey, Grace (Kidman) and her two children live by themselves in a lonely house surrounded by fog and bad weather.  After all the servants suddenly leave in the night Grace hires three new ones, informing them that the windows and doors must always be closed to protect the two children, both of whom are allergic to daylight.  Things begin to unravel as one of the children claims to see a little boy and his family and mysterious things start happening around the house.What makes this movie particularly special is the fact that it sets its audience on edge rather than outright scares them.  A claustrophobic atmosphere is built up as the characters are all literally kept behind closed doors and the dingy photography depicts the monotonous life that the family lead.  However, it is Kidman that really holds it together.  Giving a blistering performance of a woman on the edge of insanity, desperate to retain her decorum whilst the absence of her husband gnaws at her.  Definitely very different to her role as a courtesan in &#65533;Moulin Rouge&#65533;, this shows what breadth the actress has, which anyone who has watched &#65533;To Die For&#65533; will know.  Thankfully the rest of the cast are very good indeed, especially the two children.The feeling of mystery and locked-away feelings is evoked well as we&#65533;re given pieces of the puzzle gradually throughout the film.  Furthermore, &#65533;The Others&#65533; has created a whole new genre in its reliance of flesh-crawling creepiness rather than gratuitous gore.

The settings and acting were top notch as ""others"" have stated.You could feel the nervous tension that the mother felt and the strange relationship she had with her children. She seemed to both love them and be frustrated with them all at the same time.  The children, especially the daughter were very interesting characters with their own ""issues"". I was wondering at times if the daughter was ""in"" on anything or perhaps part of a greater plot twist.The servants had that overly helpful, polite yet chilling friendliness about them.  They were soooo helpful yet there was this feeling of uneasiness when they were on screen and like the daughter I couldnt decide if they were part of a ploy or tied to the house in a special way?  Very cool.My 4 star rating that I would have made a 3.5 is mostly because the ending was OK but not spectacular. It wasnt ""canned"" or anything but it didnt blow me away either.Overall this film was very well done and for a change had some intelligence built-in.

Carnegie,"[11, 13]","Just when we all thought we'd seen the back of the good old fashioned creepy ghost story along comes The Others, a good old fashioned creepy ghost story. Starring Nicole Kidman in her second great role and performance of the year (if you haven't already checked out Moulin Rouge you should).The Others was the surprise sleeper hit of Fall 2001. Directed by Spaniard Alejandro Amenabar (who directed Spanish thriller 'Open Your Eyes' recently remade as Vanilla Sky) and produced by the now ex Mr and Mrs Cruise, The Others is a welcome return to the art of suspense, as opposed to the often very poor modern schlock horror bloodfests that seem to appear in our movie theatres on a weekly basis. Set in the English channel island of Jersey shortly after its occupation by German forces during World war II, Grace (Nicole Kidman) is a single mother, apparently widowed, struggling to bring up her children in an old mansion, lacking in basic amenities such as electricity, which was cut off during the war. This is complicated further by the fact that her children suffer from a rare but potentially life-threatening allergy to sunlight and her daughter's claims that the house is haunted. In need of new servants, three mysteriously appear out of the fog BUT did they respond to Grace's advertisement or does their arrival signal a more sinister turn of events?Director, Alejandro Amenabar skilfully takes us on a tour of Grace's impossibly large and foreboding house, permanently in semi-darkness and surrounded by fog. From a slow start and be warned it is a slow start, he slowly but steadily cranks up the tension and suspense, posing more questions than he gives answers, slowly building a grip around your heart and squeezing gently. Nicole Kidman shines as the stern mother losing her mind in what is likely to be an Oscar nominated performance (although in my opinion she is better in Moulin Rouge) and she is ably supported by Eric Sykes as the gardener Mr Tuttle, the two children (Alakina Mann and James Bentley), Christopher Eccleston and in particular, the excellent Fionnula Flannagan as the housekeeper. And although you might just guess the ending before all is revealed, this is still an excellent old fashioned ghost story that (in my opinion) surpasses the likes of 'What lies Beneath' and unless you strongly dislike slow paced films I would highly recommend this.",4,SERVANTS NEEDED...,1013558400,"02 13, 2002",2002,2382,"['Just', 'when', 'thought', ""'d"", 'seen', 'back', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'creepy', 'ghost', 'story', 'Others', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'creepy', 'ghost', 'story', 'Starring', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'second', 'great', 'role', 'performance', 'year', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'checked', 'out', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'should', '.The', 'Others', 'was', 'surprise', 'sleeper', 'hit', 'Fall', '2001', 'Directed', 'Spaniard', 'Alejandro', 'Amenabar', 'who', 'directed', 'Spanish', 'thriller', ""'Open"", 'Eyes', 'recently', 'remade', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'produced', 'now', 'Mr', 'Mrs', 'Cruise', 'Others', 'welcome', 'return', 'art', 'suspense', 'opposed', 'often', 'very', 'poor', 'modern', 'schlock', 'horror', 'seem', 'appear', 'movie', 'weekly', 'basis', 'Set', 'English', 'channel', 'island', 'Jersey', 'shortly', 'occupation', 'German', 'forces', 'World', 'war', 'II', 'Grace', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'single', 'mother', 'apparently', 'widowed', 'struggling', 'bring', 'up', 'children', 'old', 'mansion', 'lacking', 'basic', 'amenities', 'such', 'electricity', 'was', 'cut', 'off', 'war', 'complicated', 'further', 'fact', 'children', 'suffer', 'rare', 'potentially', 'life-threatening', 'allergy', 'sunlight', 'daughter', 'claims', 'house', 'haunted', 'need', 'new', 'servants', 'three', 'mysteriously', 'appear', 'fog', 'BUT', 'did', 'respond', 'Grace', 'advertisement', 'arrival', 'signal', 'more', 'sinister', 'turn', 'events', 'Director', 'Alejandro', 'Amenabar', 'skilfully', 'tour', 'Grace', 'impossibly', 'large', 'foreboding', 'house', 'permanently', 'semi-darkness', 'surrounded', 'fog', 'slow', 'start', 'be', 'warned', 'slow', 'start', 'slowly', 'steadily', 'up', 'tension', 'suspense', 'posing', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'slowly', 'building', 'grip', 'heart', 'squeezing', 'gently', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'stern', 'mother', 'losing', 'mind', 'what', 'likely', 'be', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'performance', 'opinion', 'better', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'ably', 'supported', 'Eric', 'Sykes', 'gardener', 'Mr', 'Tuttle', 'two', 'children', 'Alakina', 'Mann', 'James', 'Bentley', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'particular', 'excellent', 'Fionnula', 'Flannagan', 'housekeeper', 'might', 'just', 'guess', 'ending', 'revealed', 'still', 'excellent', 'old', 'fashioned', 'ghost', 'story', 'opinion', 'likes', ""'What"", 'Beneath', 'strongly', 'dislike', 'slow', 'paced', 'films', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend']",The Others

This type of film will make you jump and cringe at what might be around the corner without losing your interest in the middle.

Set in the Edwardian era, great care was invested in presenting an authentic feel of the period. I just saw the film for the first time last night on DVD and am suitably impressed. What makes this a true gem is the creepy, sinister quality evoked. It is not dependent on gore, nor gruesome spectacle, but masterfully developes a growing dread. Where other spookfests delve into rather absurd territory, depending more on special effects and gross anatomy rendered truly gross, this movie weaves a tension that creates a psychological landscape for the fear that emerges.The only thing keeping me from giving a 5 star rating is the disappointing audio quality on the DVD. Folks look to DVD because both visual and audio quality tend to be excellent. Unfortunately, the audio on this DVD leaves much to be desired. Note to producers: Invest in a few good VU meters!Most of the film is so quiet that I really had to crank my amplifier rather high just to hear what was being said. Then, along comes a fairly noisy scene, and I was nearly blasted out of my easy chair!

However, I ended up liking it quite a bit. In my opinion there was some bad acting on her part, but the rest of the actors were very very good. I was impressed at the children in the movie - they were very convincing actors. The old woman also gave a superb performance.I loved the direction of this movie. Its scenes and timing were haunting and eerie. The feeling of the living among the dead was absolutely creepy.As for scariness, I think the previews built this movie up to be scarier than it really was. I hate when movies build up scary moments only to have them flop. For instance, there was a part with scary music where Kidman thinks she sees a creepy looking man standing in the room looking at her, but then it is revealed that it is only a painting on the wall.This movie reminded me of the movie &quot;The Haunting&quot;, which I liked, and the book &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; by Henry James, which I also liked. The mix of the living and dead characters reminded me of the theme of the book &quot;Juan Paramo&quot;.In the beginning I thought parts of the movie were cheesy. However, then it got very good and I was watching carefully for all the exciting plot twists. Several parts made me literally jump in my seat and scream out loud. Although I wish there would have been more of these parts, the parts that were there were very well done.I would recommend this movie, especially if you are in the mood to be creeped out. It would make a great video to rent at a party, but you should also see it at the theatre because of the great special effects. The music, written by the director, is superb.

Nicole Kidman is an actress I enjoy because of her versatility and the fact that she always seems to have something going on underneath her performances.  Like someone who is intelligent but may be too wrapped up in one focus.  Thats how several of her performances have struck me.  Which is a good thing.  Conveying both intelligence and life of character as well as a sub-mood is very skilled.  The twist here again is that her and her family are ghosts who haven't accepted death, much like the Sixth Sense but this movie goes a little further in the characters being disturbed.I think that there tends to be a trend in consciousness or idea-streams in movies.  Lately it's been about consciousness---The Sixth Sense, the Matrix, Vanilla Sky, Minority Report, big movies about the reality of existence, of what is alterable and what isn't.  I read somewhere that Hollywood/films are a projection of teh masses consciousness-------so when there are more violent movies and so on thats what we as a culture are experiencing on a level.  I think this can be seen with the proliferation of war movies and their ilk and at the same time these films about metaphysics, the ones that ask existentialism questions are fascinating as well.  I enjoy them because it does seem like there is challenge to them, a challenge to be more than just cookie cutter films.Also what I will credit this film with is that it completely avoids being gorey, all of the violence is languaged/explained, not shown, which ratchetts up the tension even more.

544656,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B00003CYLJ,OverTheMoon,"[1, 2]","The Others is a good movie that unfortunately can not hold out its 104 minute running time because of the confines of the twist - that we have seen before. Comparisons will be made to certain other horror twist vehicles that did the circuit around the same time as this movie.The problem with these twist films is that the entire weight of the picture is balancing on that twist. This means that the film can not really extend past those boundaries of what that has to offer. In one scene Nichole Kidman leaves her home only to be enveloped in a fog and she must return back to where she came from. That pretty much sums up what is on display here.Nichole Kidman plays a somewhat wealthy land owner whose husband has not returned from the war, her kids can not go near sunlight, her servants have left her and she is trying to keep everything together. When most of the film has played itself out to establish everything in the first twenty minutes it does not really go anywhere else until the climax. The film mostly repeats itself - Kidman acts desperately to keep control, the new servants act strange, the house is haunted. The material is recycled over and over again but this is what we usually expect from films that hang onto that twist as the final affirmation that will effectively blow out our candle.Overall the twist does work but is nothing that you have not seen before if you have seen other types of these themes. The acting from Kidman is quite good but everyone else is a little under par including Christopher Eccleston's performance. It all looks very stage-like and has more television appeal than DVD or the cinema screen. In fact it works better as something you switch onto after seeing the news. This would be a more apt market niche for it than mainstream cinema and it plays better as a Television movie. It is more along that ""quality"" of film making than what the A-list leading lady suggests.This is a good horror yarn and a nice Ghost story, but not spectacular cinema, powerhouse performing or the brilliant film as some may tout. It is just good but nothing new or original. It does boost a few scares but these can be handled by most teenagers or anyone above the 12 age group category.... maybe even some people below that age.

544657,A35TN5YGURE6IV,B00003CYLJ,"""oxzo""","[4, 5]",This was a good performance from Nicole Kidman and the actors who played her children. The truth of the situation faced by them with regards to the &quot;others&quot; does become patently obvious and the storyline is relatively predictable. Nevertheless I recommend this movie and would rate it above average compared to a lot of others out there.If you are into period pieces this is also a good one for you. The story transpires in 1945 as I recall shortly after the end of WWII from which Nicole's husband never returned. Her and the two children live in a spiffy English mansion on an isle in the British Channel that the Germans had occupied during the war. Nicole excellently depicts the haughty and aristocratic lady of the house who knows her social station and is accustomed to directing servants.The tone of the movie is further set to the spooky end by the medical condition of her children being sensitive to light requiring that the house be kept dark. Since there is no electricity it's all candles and gas lamps and well you get the picture. There is also a fair amount of spooky English fog too...What you won't see here is a lot of big splashy special effects the film relies on more traditional techniques.These details give you a sense of the atmosphere but not the real storyline for that you have to watch the movie. I thought it an excellent performance and actually watched it twice (once with my mom too she like it as well).,5,Not All Good Movies Are Rated R,1027641600,"07 26, 2002",2002,1449,"['was', 'good', 'performance', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'children', 'truth', 'situation', 'faced', 'regards', 'quot', 'others', 'quot', 'become', 'patently', 'obvious', 'storyline', 'relatively', 'predictable', 'recommend', 'movie', 'would', 'rate', 'average', 'compared', 'lot', 'others', 'out', 'are', 'period', 'pieces', 'also', 'good', 'one', 'story', 'transpires', '1945', 'recall', 'shortly', 'end', 'WWII', 'Nicole', 'husband', 'never', 'returned', 'Her', 'two', 'children', 'live', 'spiffy', 'English', 'mansion', 'isle', 'British', 'Channel', 'Germans', 'had', 'occupied', 'war', 'Nicole', 'excellently', 'haughty', 'aristocratic', 'lady', 'house', 'who', 'social', 'station', 'accustomed', 'directing', 'servants.The', 'tone', 'movie', 'further', 'set', 'spooky', 'end', 'medical', 'condition', 'children', 'being', 'sensitive', 'light', 'requiring', 'house', 'be', 'kept', 'dark', 'electricity', 'candles', 'gas', 'lamps', 'well', 'get', 'picture', 'also', 'fair', 'amount', 'spooky', 'English', 'fog', 'too', 'What', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'here', 'lot', 'big', 'splashy', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'relies', 'more', 'traditional', 'techniques.These', 'details', 'give', 'sense', 'atmosphere', 'not', 'real', 'storyline', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'thought', 'excellent', 'performance', 'actually', 'watched', 'twice', 'once', 'mom', 'too', 'as', 'well']",The Others

544659,AJUEE2C2EJ0V3,B00003CYLJ,Paperbackstash,"[0, 0]","This isn't for those liking high-paced action, relentless violence or gore. But those who enjoy a well-developed plotline, detailed characterization, and isolated settings will feel as close to horror heaven as the past few years have delivered.The family is obviously unstable. The house is enclosed in darkness due to a rare disorder the children have concerning light or the sun. It could kill them, the mother Grace says. All doors must be locked when they are closed, the windows must always be drawn, candles are to be used for the artificial light which they must live by. Set back in olden times the father/husband has gone to war and hasn't returned. Sitting there with bible studies, migraines and stress the mother waits and watches for his return, trying her best to care for the two children she must raise by herself, and wanting to instill in them the importance and fear of God. And now the children begin to fear that their home is haunted.The others involved are three servants. The main housekeeper Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), a stocky but polite woman who seems to have a few secrets of her own. A mute young girl with long unkept dark hair (Elaine Cassidy)who is seen at strange moments, and the gardener - an older man (Eric Sykes) who may or may not be married to Mills - I didn't catch if they were tied together in any way or not. The help doesn't add much to the story except for the old woman lead. Her dialogue is a bit too ominious at times but as the movie progresses it turns out to be a very effective role.This movie is so wrapped up in the unknown that it can't help but be dark and give you the jeebies. This is a supernatural horror film NOT run down by off the wall SF. (cough) The Haunting (cough). As we're watching little things are thrown in that shoot any previous theories we formed to s***. Through the movie we're not sure what is what. Bouncing from childhood tricks and games to signs of spooks; creepy servants who showed out of nowhere and obviously have something they're hiding; glimpses of insanity and strain of the woman and the children -- we have a pure-bred horror/mystery glee on our hands.I was kept on my toes until the end, which delivered a powerful climax. Whatever else, don't let the ending be ruined for you. Maybe some people saw it a mile away but I didn't. And I also didnt try to sit and try to figure it out, either, as I *didn't* want to know yet. It may not be the most original of concepts but it works.I find the movie a little similar to The Shining. Isolation, cabin fever. A woman trapped with two kids, no escape, and no one to help her. Overburdened by responsibilites as Jack was with his duties, Grace is faced with even more pressure; how does she work through it?The directing by newcomer Alejandro Amen&iexcl;bar is hard to beat. Due to the darkness of the old house because of the kids, a dark and forbidden type mode is set. The tension is emphasized by long lapses of silence (no music) and whispered tones, quiet voices, no outside distraction like traffic, the television. Then suddenly something is loud and startling. Most of the time heard and not seen. All work together to make this movie the best it could be. Nothing predictable in that you expect something to pop out of you and then it does; this is not a standard formula of cheap chills and thrills.Kidman blew me away as Grace. I'm not her greatest fan but I loved her in this. The children can actually act; Mrs. Mills does her part and the others are just...there. But they're meant to be.One bad thing I can think of is that this movie dragged a bit too much at some points. Sometimes wierd things took too long to take place, and I need to be in a movie watching mood to watch it from start to finish. Slow paced, definitely, but interesting even at the more quieter parts.Definitely a dynamic tale of macabre that should be valued as a top dog of supernatural horror.",3,"A little dull, but intriguing",1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,3928,"[""n't"", 'liking', 'high-paced', 'action', 'relentless', 'violence', 'gore', 'who', 'enjoy', 'well-developed', 'plotline', 'detailed', 'characterization', 'isolated', 'settings', 'will', 'feel', 'close', 'horror', 'heaven', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'have', 'delivered.The', 'family', 'obviously', 'unstable', 'house', 'enclosed', 'darkness', 'due', 'rare', 'disorder', 'children', 'have', 'concerning', 'light', 'sun', 'could', 'kill', 'mother', 'Grace', 'doors', 'must', 'be', 'locked', 'when', 'are', 'closed', 'windows', 'must', 'always', 'be', 'drawn', 'candles', 'are', 'be', 'used', 'artificial', 'light', 'must', 'live', 'Set', 'back', 'olden', 'times', 'father/husband', 'gone', 'war', ""n't"", 'returned', 'Sitting', 'there', 'bible', 'studies', 'migraines', 'stress', 'mother', 'waits', 'watches', 'return', 'trying', 'best', 'care', 'two', 'children', 'must', 'raise', 'wanting', 'instill', 'importance', 'fear', 'God', 'now', 'children', 'begin', 'fear', 'home', 'haunted.The', 'others', 'involved', 'are', 'three', 'servants', 'main', 'housekeeper', 'Mrs.', 'Mills', 'Fionnula', 'Flanagan', 'stocky', 'polite', 'woman', 'who', 'have', 'few', 'secrets', 'own', 'mute', 'young', 'girl', 'long', 'unkept', 'dark', 'hair', 'Elaine', 'Cassidy', 'who', 'seen', 'strange', 'moments', 'gardener', 'older', 'man', 'Eric', 'Sykes', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'married', 'Mills', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'were', 'tied', 'together', 'way', 'not', 'help', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'story', 'old', 'woman', 'lead', 'dialogue', 'bit', 'too', 'ominious', 'times', 'movie', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'effective', 'role.This', 'movie', 'so', 'wrapped', 'up', 'unknown', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'dark', 'give', 'jeebies', 'supernatural', 'horror', 'film', 'NOT', 'run', 'down', 'wall', 'SF', 'cough', 'Haunting', 'cough', ""'re"", 'watching', 'little', 'things', 'are', 'thrown', 'shoot', 'previous', 'theories', 'formed', 's***', 'movie', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'what', 'Bouncing', 'childhood', 'tricks', 'games', 'signs', 'spooks', 'creepy', 'servants', 'who', 'showed', 'nowhere', 'obviously', 'have', 'something', ""'re"", 'hiding', 'glimpses', 'insanity', 'strain', 'woman', 'children', 'have', 'pure-bred', 'horror/mystery', 'glee', 'hands.I', 'was', 'kept', 'toes', 'end', 'delivered', 'powerful', 'climax', 'else', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'ending', 'be', 'ruined', 'Maybe', 'people', 'saw', 'mile', 'away', 'did', ""n't"", 'also', 'didnt', 'try', 'sit', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'either', ""*didn't*"", 'want', 'know', 'yet', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'original', 'concepts', 'find', 'movie', 'little', 'similar', 'Shining', 'Isolation', 'cabin', 'fever', 'woman', 'trapped', 'two', 'kids', 'escape', 'one', 'help', 'Overburdened', 'responsibilites', 'Jack', 'was', 'duties', 'Grace', 'faced', 'even', 'more', 'pressure', 'how', 'work', 'directing', 'newcomer', 'Alejandro', 'Amen', 'iexcl', 'bar', 'hard', 'beat', 'Due', 'darkness', 'old', 'house', 'kids', 'dark', 'forbidden', 'type', 'mode', 'set', 'tension', 'emphasized', 'long', 'lapses', 'silence', 'music', 'whispered', 'tones', 'quiet', 'voices', 'outside', 'distraction', 'traffic', 'television', 'Then', 'suddenly', 'something', 'loud', 'startling', 'Most', 'time', 'heard', 'not', 'seen', 'work', 'together', 'make', 'movie', 'best', 'could', 'be', 'Nothing', 'predictable', 'expect', 'something', 'pop', 'then', 'not', 'standard', 'formula', 'cheap', 'chills', 'thrills.Kidman', 'blew', 'away', 'Grace', ""'m"", 'not', 'greatest', 'fan', 'loved', 'children', 'can', 'actually', 'act', 'Mrs.', 'Mills', 'part', 'others', 'are', 'just', 'there', ""'re"", 'meant', 'be.One', 'bad', 'thing', 'can', 'think', 'movie', 'dragged', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'points', 'Sometimes', 'wierd', 'things', 'took', 'too', 'long', 'take', 'place', 'need', 'be', 'movie', 'watching', 'mood', 'watch', 'start', 'finish', 'Slow', 'paced', 'definitely', 'interesting', 'even', 'more', 'quieter', 'parts.Definitely', 'dynamic', 'tale', 'macabre', 'should', 'be', 'valued', 'top', 'dog', 'supernatural', 'horror']",The Others

The story revolves around Grace (Nicole Kidman) and her two children Anne and Nicholas.  Grace and her children have been abandoned by her husband who left and has yet to return from fighting in the World War.  The family lives alone in a very large, old house, where the drapes are always closed, the rooms are always locked, and everything is very silent.  The reason for the drapes and the locks-- Grace's children are somehow allergic to light.  If exposed to light, the children would develop sores, have difficulty breathing, and possibly die.  To Grace, the house is like a ship and the light is like water...every adjoining door must be closed and locked to ensure no light will touch the children.  The house must also be very silent because Grace gets very bad migraines.Grace is very strict with the children and often makes them read from the Bible.  Grace is particularly strict about lying, which seems to be a problem with Anne.  Anne loves to frighten her younger brother by telling him ghost stories. She sometimes even pretends that there are ghosts in the room and she will have conversations with them.  Anne gets into trouble often because she always talks about ghosts.Living alone in a dark house with two children is a difficult job so Grace hires three servants, Lydia (a mysterious mute), Mrs. Mills, and Mr. Tuttle.  It is fortunate for Grace that these particular three servants answered her add in the paper because they worked at the house previously and are very familiar with the layout-- working in the dark less of a problem for them.  Once the servants arrive strange things start to occur-- doors are left open and unlocked, drapes are opened, and Grace hears loud noises.  At first, she blames the servants, but Anne is adamant that the disturbances are due to the ghosts.  Refusing to believe this, Grace and the servants search the entire house to find the intruder who must be hiding out.  They find nothing....and then more strange things occur and Grace starts to believe that the house is haunted.  To tell more would ruin the movie....""The Others"" is a classic haunted house thriller.  The acting is well done, the scenery is appropriately spooky, and the story twists, turns, and becomes more and more mysterious.

In fact it's so old fashioned that some of the things you won't find in it are killer cyborgs, acid spewing aliens, or genetically engineered puking dog-thing snot-monsters! But don't worry, because what you will find is a superb story, a clutch of breathtaking performances, and a palpable sense of dread that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat `til the very end.The story is set during the last years of WWII on an island off the British coast. On this island is a secluded, fog-bound mansion, inhabited by a single mother, who's husband went off to the war, and their two children who suffer from a strange condition, ""Xeroderma Pigmentosum,"" which means they are hyper-sensitive to light. The mansion is permanently shrouded in fog outside, and permanently dark inside, as the heavy drapes in each window are kept permanently shut to protect the children. Any prolonged exposure to full sunlight will result in the children being subjected to blistering, 3rd degree burns, or even death.The mother, Grace Stewart, a breathtaking performance by Nicole Kidman, is overly protective of the children, to say the very least. She frets and worries incessantly about their condition, and is compulsive in her checking of door-locks, and the security of the drapes over the windows. The children, Anne and Nicholas, luminously portrayed by Alakina Mann and James Bentley, live a stifling twilight existence within the walls of the mansion, dealing as best they can with their medical condition, and the suffocating love of their mother.As we meet Grace for the first time, screaming herself awake from an unseen nightmare, we can see that she's under incredible pressure, and at the end of her rope. She's barely able to cope with the loss of her husband, the children's condition, and running the mansion single-handedly, the servants having deserted the family a week ago, without even collecting their last weeks pay! But help arrives in the nick-of-time, in the shape of 3 estate workers, a housekeeper, scullery maid, and gardener. Grace is initially suspicious of the 3 as she had yet to post a ""Help Wanted"" ad in the village shop. The housekeeper, Mrs Mills, wonderfully played by Fionnula Flanagan, explains that they used to work at the mansion in years gone by, and called on the off-chance of finding work, in doubtless trying times.As if the initial set-up isn't bizarre enough, with the arrival of the new staff things start to get really strange; inexplicable noises, talk of ghosts, a photographic ""Book of the Dead,"" musical instruments playing unaccompanied... and Mrs Mills knows far more than she's letting on, as do the scullery maid and the gardener!I'm not going to say anything else about the film; I don't want to spoil it for you if you haven't seen it already, I'll just say that I'm not ashamed to say I did NOT guess the final twist in the tale! In fact, I actually saw the film twice when it was first released, because the cinema was evacuated about half way through when there was a tornado warning in the area; I couldn't wait to go back and see it again the next day!!!Much has been said about Nicole Kidman's performance, and I have to say she is amazing! Highly-strung, brittle, compulsive, fiercely protective of her children...and her accent is wonderful! She drives the film relentlessly, along with the performances of Fionnula Flanagan, and the children; James Bentley, as Nicholas, in particular, gives an incredible, jaw-dropping performance. But it's the writing and directing of Alejandro Amenabar that is the secret of ""The Others."" The story is wonderful, and the direction exemplary; Amenabar builds the tension and sense of dread relentlessly, `til you don't think you can stand it any longer!This is a 2-disc set, and the ""extras"" disc contains a couple of interesting items. There's the ubiquitous ""making of"" feature, and a documentary on a family who's children actually suffer from ""Xeroderma Pigmentosum,"" the disease featured in ""The Others."" There's also an SFX feature... like I said, no killer cyborgs, snot monsters etc, what SFX?!?!?!

544672,A319YRDK8Y39N,B00003CYLJ,"""qmlhcb""","[0, 1]","The greatest strength in The Others is it's creepy gothic atmosphere which pervades every scene. This is definitely a mood film, all about creating an off-kilter texture of images on screen that feels like they take place in another world. But an all-to-similar ending to another recent ghost blockbuster weakens its overall strength.The film jumps right into the story as a mother (Nicole Kidman) is showing new caretakers around her large mansion on a small island off England during World War II. Soon we're introduced to her two children, who have a rare skin condition that don't allow them to be in the sunlight, and learn her husband mostly likely died in battle. But things begin to get strange in the already creepy environment when the daughter is convinced there are ""invaders"" in the house, ghostly sounds and visions that soon begin to haunt the family.Without a doubt, if it wasn't for the deliciously crafted mood created by the set, music, and lighting (expertly realized with candlelight), as well as the superb acting by Kidman and her two young co-stars, this film probably wouldn't be worth your time. The tried and true plot device of a haunted house works, but the ending feels like a let-down when you know you're supposed to be shocked. If The Others had come out prior to ... possible spoiler warning ... The Sixth Sense, its very similar ending would have had a much deeper impact. Yet it's also not as expertly crafted as The Sixth Sense, which never let on to its shocking revelation. Instead, The Others gives enough clues along the way that when the final twist is unraveled, typical reaction is only slight surprise. An additional small annoyance throughout the film is the overstating of particular ideas and observances. Whenever the film would offer enough clues to easily figure something out, the characters always have to state it, just to make sure the audience gets it. As long as you're an attentive audience member, you don't need to be told, and doing so just seems like an insult to your intelligence.After all that, it may sound like this film isn't all that great, but honestly, as I said before, the ending nor the minor problems leading up to it really don't matter a whole lot when compared to how expertly this film conveys mood and it's unsettling gothic atmosphere.

They eventually learn that they just might not be alone. I dont like giving away much of the story, so thats why ive spared the details.Visually this films atmosphere is quite dark and foggy, and sets perfect mood for such a movie and story. I love the house, i wish they showed even more of it, becouse the furnishing and style of the homes exterior and interior are interesting.The music that we have to accompany us through the rooms and events in the film is well done. The films main theme is a fine meloncholic mystery to it. The soundtrack was very important in this film, and plays a good role.Nicole Kidman's acting as the mom was good in this film; so was the acting of the two children, it was interesting to hear them talk, like the daughter who convincingly intelligent for her age.We also meet three servants, who i find as the most enjoyable of all the characters in the film, an older lady, an older gentlman, and a young girl thats in her early 20s. And out of those three, i found Mr. Toddle's acting as the most entertaining, to me, personally, though he nowhere near had as big a role as the mother. But i love british acting like that, and i wish he had more lines.The best acting i feel is from the supporting cast, becouse they really made me forget they were acting and in a movie, their skill is that good.While Nichole Kidman (the Mother) acted decent, i still kept seeing her as performing infront of the camera, at times, but shes not a bad actress. I just enjoyed the servant's performance the most, and the daughters is interesting too, whose little brother is very good too.The plot is not bad at all and like the cover says ""It has a wicked twist of an ending"". And theres depth to the characters. Theres something interesting we learn about everyone as we are introduced to the characters, especially the kids, who you will find have a unique circumstance, to say the least.It has classic scares and suspense, and would be a fine addition to anyones scary film collection.What has me coming back to the movie is the acting, and the music and the scenery. When youve seen it once and discover how it all unfolds, you no longer have any more suprises the next time you wanna watch it. So what do ya have? Again, i really liked the acting by the supporting chacters and everyone, and the music and atmosphere of this huge and VERY DARK mansion/palace is quite interesting to experience multiple times.Though my only ""complaint"" would be that i wish we saw much much more of the place. That mansion is enormous...i would of lashed over every detail of such a fine place as that if they took the time to widen the scope of the viewers look within the house and rooms and all that.I think it would of gave the film vast and spralling character, i wish they could of tacked on more time to show scenes of the very exploration of this place.But thats just more of a personal wish, and doesnt tarnish the film at all. I just think i would of loved this movie if it took us on a more epic perspective, visually, when it came to the house. Though scenes of outdoors are more roomy, but still, outting into the forrest are overwhelmed by thick fog. Now that i think of it, a wonderfully haunting jaunt into the woods would of been very fascinating. But the fog kind of keeps everyone captive, so to speak. Again...just a personal peeve that doesnt tarnish anything, just would of made the film grander.Anyways...this version comes with special features, that are pretty interesting. Youll see a feature Documentary of the film, a feaurette on the Special FX found in the movie.Also a featurette showing an actual real life family who have children dealing with what the kids in movie apparently deal with. ( and No, i cant tell you what there situation is...go watch the movie, its worth finding out on your own)And a close look at the director, if that at all appeals to you.Plus a still gallery , such and such and so on.Its really cool how quality films like this are being sold for bargain prices. I bought my copy, used, for 5 dollars, and it was very good condition.Its worth buying, even at list price/ brand new without any discounts.A quality ghost film.",4,"A quality ""ghost"" film",1193184000,"10 24, 2007",2007,4282,"['film', 'mother', 'children', 'who', 'live', 'big', 'mansion', 'alone', 'island', 'war', 'time', 'eventually', 'learn', 'just', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'alone', 'dont', 'giving', 'away', 'much', 'story', 'so', 'thats', 'why', 'ive', 'spared', 'details.Visually', 'films', 'atmosphere', 'quite', 'dark', 'foggy', 'sets', 'perfect', 'mood', 'movie', 'story', 'love', 'house', 'i', 'wish', 'showed', 'even', 'more', 'furnishing', 'style', 'homes', 'exterior', 'interior', 'are', 'interesting.The', 'music', 'have', 'accompany', 'rooms', 'events', 'film', 'well', 'done', 'films', 'main', 'theme', 'fine', 'meloncholic', 'mystery', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'very', 'important', 'film', 'good', 'role.Nicole', 'Kidman', 'acting', 'mom', 'was', 'good', 'film', 'was', 'acting', 'two', 'children', 'was', 'interesting', 'hear', 'talk', 'daughter', 'who', 'convincingly', 'intelligent', 'age.We', 'also', 'meet', 'three', 'servants', 'who', 'i', 'find', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'characters', 'film', 'older', 'lady', 'older', 'gentlman', 'young', 'girl', 'thats', 'early', '20s', 'three', 'i', 'found', 'Mr.', 'Toddle', 'acting', 'most', 'entertaining', 'personally', 'nowhere', 'near', 'had', 'big', 'role', 'mother', 'i', 'love', 'british', 'acting', 'i', 'wish', 'had', 'more', 'lines.The', 'best', 'acting', 'i', 'feel', 'supporting', 'cast', 'really', 'made', 'forget', 'were', 'acting', 'movie', 'skill', 'good.While', 'Nichole', 'Kidman', 'Mother', 'acted', 'decent', 'i', 'still', 'kept', 'seeing', 'performing', 'infront', 'camera', 'times', 'not', 'bad', 'actress', 'just', 'enjoyed', 'servant', 'performance', 'most', 'daughters', 'interesting', 'too', 'little', 'brother', 'very', 'good', 'too.The', 'plot', 'not', 'bad', 'cover', 'wicked', 'twist', 'ending', 'depth', 'characters', 'Theres', 'something', 'interesting', 'learn', 'about', 'everyone', 'are', 'introduced', 'characters', 'especially', 'kids', 'who', 'will', 'find', 'have', 'unique', 'circumstance', 'say', 'least.It', 'classic', 'scares', 'suspense', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'addition', 'anyones', 'scary', 'film', 'collection.What', 'coming', 'back', 'movie', 'acting', 'music', 'scenery', 'When', 'youve', 'seen', 'once', 'discover', 'how', 'unfolds', 'no', 'longer', 'have', 'more', 'suprises', 'next', 'time', 'wan', 'na', 'watch', 'So', 'what', 'do', 'ya', 'have', 'Again', 'i', 'really', 'liked', 'acting', 'supporting', 'chacters', 'everyone', 'music', 'atmosphere', 'huge', 'VERY', 'DARK', 'mansion/palace', 'quite', 'interesting', 'experience', 'multiple', 'only', 'complaint', 'would', 'be', 'i', 'wish', 'saw', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'place', 'mansion', 'enormous', 'i', 'would', 'lashed', 'detail', 'such', 'fine', 'place', 'took', 'time', 'widen', 'scope', 'viewers', 'look', 'house', 'rooms', 'that.I', 'think', 'would', 'gave', 'film', 'vast', 'spralling', 'character', 'i', 'wish', 'could', 'tacked', 'more', 'time', 'show', 'scenes', 'very', 'exploration', 'place.But', 'just', 'more', 'personal', 'wish', 'doesnt', 'tarnish', 'film', 'just', 'think', 'i', 'would', 'loved', 'movie', 'took', 'more', 'epic', 'perspective', 'visually', 'when', 'came', 'house', 'scenes', 'outdoors', 'are', 'more', 'roomy', 'still', 'outting', 'forrest', 'are', 'overwhelmed', 'thick', 'fog', 'Now', 'i', 'think', 'wonderfully', 'haunting', 'jaunt', 'woods', 'would', 'been', 'very', 'fascinating', 'fog', 'kind', 'keeps', 'everyone', 'captive', 'so', 'speak', 'Again', 'just', 'personal', 'peeve', 'tarnish', 'anything', 'just', 'would', 'made', 'film', 'grander.Anyways', 'version', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'Youll', 'see', 'feature', 'Documentary', 'film', 'feaurette', 'Special', 'FX', 'found', 'movie.Also', 'featurette', 'showing', 'actual', 'real', 'life', 'family', 'who', 'have', 'children', 'dealing', 'what', 'kids', 'movie', 'apparently', 'No', 'i', 'cant', 'tell', 'what', 'situation', 'go', 'watch', 'movie', 'worth', 'finding', 'out', 'own', 'close', 'look', 'director', 'appeals', 'you.Plus', 'still', 'gallery', 'such', 'such', 'so', 'on.Its', 'really', 'cool', 'how', 'quality', 'films', 'are', 'being', 'sold', 'bargain', 'prices', 'bought', 'copy', 'used', '5', 'dollars', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'condition.Its', 'buying', 'even', 'list', 'price/', 'brand', 'new', 'discounts.A', 'quality', 'ghost', 'film']",The Others

544679,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00003CYLJ,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[1, 1]","The irony is I was ""more scared"" of viewing this movie than I was while watching it. The previews gave me more chills, but honestly there is nothing really scary in this movie. It just made me feel ""tense."" You wait in anticipation for something absolutely scary to happen and the most scary thing is the curtains being left open.Reading the reviews here at Amazon makes this movie worth watching. I mean, watching and then reading. GLBT's review had me almost rolling on the floor. It was worth watching the movie to understand why he said what he did. Sweetmolly's review is probably more in line with how I felt about the movie. Lleu Christopher (Author of The Stone of Alexandria) mentioned it reminded him of ""Rebecca"" and I have to agree. Although I found ""Rebecca"" more creepy.There is this one scene where Nicole gets walloped with a door that is quite hilarious in a slapstick type way. Finally there was some comic relief. Otherwise there is a ""certain tension"" throughout the movie. Nicole is perfect for the role of the obsessive compulsive mother.You don't understand the implication until the creepy twist at the end. I want to start asking questions about the ""logic of the story,"" however that would completely give away the interesting aspects. You will also feel yourself becoming very skeptical about the characters as the movie progresses.What you basically have is an obsessive mother living in a mansion in a misty woods where she keeps all the curtains closed. She believes her children to be photosensitive (acutely sensitive to all forms of Ultra Violet light) and keeps the light out of the rooms by locking one door and then opening the next. To get to her children, she has to lock and unlock doors. This adds a bit of fun when she has to get to them when she thinks they are screaming. Except her children are not the ones making the noise. It is a boy named Victor who she can't see, but her children can see.The entire story occurs at one house with most of the activity occurring inside one room or the other.They really don't develop the characters. We know they are religious, but we have no ideas what they actually enjoy doing. The children only study, the mother only locks doors and embroiders. There are a few religious discussions. The script writers make a  point of having the children question religion in a way that is beyond their understanding.Not riveting, but interesting from an artistic perspective. If you are waiting for blood to drip through cracks in an old wood floor, you will be slightly disappointed. What is impressive is a movie with a lack of sex, swearing (can't remember any) and slaughter. It proves a movie can be entertaining without being excessive.Honestly, this is a nice movie you can watch on a quiet evening and not feel afraid to walk down the hallway to bed. I'm pretty sure that was not the case if you saw it in the theatre.Intellectual Horror with Old-Fashioned Appeal.~The Rebecca Review",4,Children of the Moon,1047254400,"03 10, 2003",2003,2965,"['irony', 'was', 'more', 'scared', 'viewing', 'movie', 'was', 'watching', 'previews', 'gave', 'more', 'chills', 'honestly', 'nothing', 'really', 'scary', 'movie', 'just', 'made', 'feel', 'tense', 'wait', 'anticipation', 'something', 'absolutely', 'scary', 'happen', 'most', 'scary', 'thing', 'curtains', 'being', 'left', 'open.Reading', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'movie', 'watching', 'mean', 'watching', 'then', 'reading', 'GLBT', 'review', 'had', 'almost', 'rolling', 'floor', 'was', 'worth', 'watching', 'movie', 'understand', 'why', 'said', 'what', 'did', 'Sweetmolly', 'review', 'probably', 'more', 'line', 'how', 'felt', 'movie', 'Lleu', 'Christopher', 'Author', 'Stone', 'Alexandria', 'mentioned', 'reminded', 'Rebecca', 'have', 'agree', 'found', 'Rebecca', 'more', 'creepy.There', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Nicole', 'walloped', 'door', 'quite', 'hilarious', 'slapstick', 'type', 'way', 'Finally', 'was', 'comic', 'relief', 'certain', 'tension', 'movie', 'Nicole', 'perfect', 'role', 'obsessive', 'compulsive', 'mother.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'implication', 'creepy', 'twist', 'end', 'want', 'start', 'asking', 'questions', 'logic', 'story', 'however', 'would', 'completely', 'give', 'away', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'will', 'also', 'feel', 'becoming', 'very', 'skeptical', 'characters', 'movie', 'basically', 'have', 'obsessive', 'mother', 'living', 'mansion', 'misty', 'woods', 'where', 'curtains', 'closed', 'children', 'be', 'photosensitive', 'acutely', 'sensitive', 'forms', 'Ultra', 'Violet', 'light', 'light', 'rooms', 'locking', 'one', 'door', 'then', 'opening', 'next', 'get', 'children', 'lock', 'unlock', 'doors', 'bit', 'fun', 'when', 'get', 'when', 'are', 'screaming', 'children', 'are', 'not', 'ones', 'making', 'noise', 'boy', 'named', 'Victor', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'children', 'can', 'see.The', 'entire', 'story', 'one', 'house', 'most', 'activity', 'occurring', 'one', 'room', 'other.They', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'develop', 'characters', 'know', 'are', 'religious', 'have', 'ideas', 'what', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'doing', 'children', 'only', 'study', 'mother', 'only', 'doors', 'embroiders', 'are', 'few', 'religious', 'discussions', 'script', 'writers', 'make', 'point', 'having', 'children', 'question', 'religion', 'way', 'understanding.Not', 'riveting', 'interesting', 'artistic', 'perspective', 'are', 'waiting', 'blood', 'drip', 'cracks', 'old', 'wood', 'floor', 'will', 'be', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'What', 'impressive', 'movie', 'lack', 'sex', 'swearing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'slaughter', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'entertaining', 'being', 'excessive.Honestly', 'nice', 'movie', 'can', 'watch', 'quiet', 'evening', 'not', 'feel', 'afraid', 'walk', 'down', 'hallway', 'bed', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'saw', 'theatre.Intellectual', 'Horror', 'Old-Fashioned', 'Appeal.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",The Others

544684,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00003CYLJ,Reviewer,"[3, 3]","Films that deal with the supernatural, whether in direct or implied terms, are more often than not disappointing, in that they rarely manage to deliver on their promise.  Moreover, films of that same school touted as being &#65533;scary,&#65533; as well, are usually even more of a let down; so a film that can truly bring a supernatural theme to fruition and be frightening-- joltingly scary even-- in the balance, is one to be celebrated.  &#65533;The Others,&#65533; written and directed by Aleiandro Amenabar, is a film to be celebrated.  Unlike most films of the genre, this is a true sojourn into regions beyond the known that actually takes you to that final destination.  And when your mouth is so dry you can&#65533;t swallow, and the palms of your hands have gone clammy cold with sweat, you&#65533;ll know you&#65533;ve arrived; that Amenabar has succeeded in taking you to that place where few filmmakers dare to even attempt to go.  By the end of the film, it&#65533;s clear that when Amenabar makes a promise, he keeps it.The Channel Islands, 1945:  World War II has ended, and in a picturesque country mansion, the mistress of the manor, Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman), is at the end of her tether; she has not heard from, nor about, her husband, Charles (Christopher Eccleston) since he went off to war, and all of her servants-- including her children&#65533;s nanny-- have inexplicably disappeared without notice and without a trace.  Caring for her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), without help, is beginning to overwhelm her, as they suffer from a rare disease that makes them vulnerable to light any brighter than the essential amount of candlepower, a condition that demands the utmost vigilance on the part of their caretaker.  And at the moment, that means Grace, alone, in a house by necessity shrouded in darkness.Help arrives, however, in the form of Ms. Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan) and her companions, Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes), and a young girl named Lydia (Elaine Cassidy), in response to an add placed by Grace in a local newspaper.  All experienced in service, they are the answer to Grace&#65533;s immediate problems, and she puts them to work immediately.  But it soon becomes apparent to Ms. Mills and the others, that something is amiss in the household; something to do with Grace, who seems to be having trouble coping.  Still, there&#65533;s more:  Anne insists that she has seen &#65533;others&#65533; in the house, including a young boy she calls &#65533;Victor.&#65533;  And, according to Anne, Victor claims that the house belongs to him and those with him.  The real problem, though, is the fact that no one else can see him.  Only Anne.  And it&#65533;s about to take Grace to the very edge of what&#65533;s left of her sanity.  If, indeed, there is any left at all by that time.More than a supernatural thriller, what Amenabar has created here is a gem that stands out from among the rest because of it&#65533;s sheer purity and brilliance; a diamond with it&#65533;s own unique cut that dazzles the mind and the eye with it&#65533;s perfection.  From the opening frames, he sets a deliberate pace and begins to sow the seeds of doubt and question, opening that Pandora&#65533;s Box of enticement that allows you to consider that otherworldly devices are actually at play here.  In the quietude of the atmosphere he&#65533;s so deftly created, he winds the tension slowly and subtly until the wheel can turn no more, and just at the point at which others films would fail because they simply cannot deliver on the promise of what has preceded, he hits you with the reality of what is happening, and in a way that will jar your senses.  He does not manipulate and he does not play games; he quite simply and directly delivers one of the best endings ever filmed within this particular genre, especially, and moreover, one that will stand against any of the best from any category.  Because, regardless of genre, very few films have ever delivered so well on what has been promised as the story unfolds.Nicole Kidman was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress for her performance in &#65533;Moulin Rouge&#65533; this year (and deservedly so), but her portrayal of Grace Stewart is the one that should have put her at center stage and clutching the gold on the big night.  Her presentation of Grace is introspective, subtle and reserved; understated and convincing, she fills the screen with a dark charm that is reminiscent, and yet something of the antithesis, of Grace Kelly.  And her screen presence has never been more dynamic.  She enables you to feel her fear, anger, confusion and frustration as the drama moves toward the denouement, and it is Grace through whom you most experience the impact of that final, breathtaking scene, when all is at last revealed.  A truly memorable performance from the gifted and beautiful Kidman, and one that is destined to be more appreciated with the passing of time.Flanagan turns in a memorable performance, as well, creating a character in Ms. Mills that transcends the stereotype of one &#65533;in service,&#65533; and successfully adds to the aura of mystery surrounding the events as they transpire.  It&#65533;s a portrayal that demonstrates how important a good character actor is, and how much it can add to a film.The supporting cast includes Renee Asherson (Old Lady), Gordon Reid (Assistant), Keith Allen (Mr. Marlish), Michelle Fairley (Mrs. Marlish) and Alexander Vince as Victor.  Riveting entertainment that will slow your breathing and increase your heart rate, &#65533;The Others&#65533; is an inspired film that offers one of, if not &#65533;the&#65533; most satisfying endings ever produced in the realm of supernatural cinema.  Amenabar is a magician who has performed the impossible:  He&#65533;s made the &#65533;Super&#65533; in supernatural viable and real, succeeding where almost all others who have tried failed.

Robert Wise's THE HAUNTING (1963) was quite similar, and far superior, as were the two ""English"" haunted house movies that come to mind (""The Innocents"", ""The Uninvited""). From a 2001 perspective, I'm so completely impressed that elements of my 3 favorite haunted-house films have resurfaced so intelligently today without resorting to smarmy fake CGI effects. Most of the credit must go to Alejandro Amenabar, director and visionary (he also ""wrote"" the score...with the help of a computer...to eerie and substantial effect). Amenabar controlled the slow descent into abject terror so perfectly that I was totally taken in. Other reviewers suggested that the ending was obvious..sorry, I kept my mind a little more open to the flow of events. Nicole Kidman was justly given kudos for this performance, and I was very impressed with Fionnula Flannigan as the housekeeper. But the real treats here are the performances of two absolutely superb kid actors, Alakina Mann & James Bentley. Nothing annoys me more than bad kid actors; these two were brilliant: natural and genuinely convincing...a rarity! The 2-disc DVD has a great transfer of the film; the 2nd disc has some extra ""stuff"", though not enough to warrant an extra disc. One interesting ""extra"" is an explanation of XP (Xeroderma Pigmentosum), which I found interesting because I'm a fan of Dean Koontz, and one of his best heroes suffered from this (""Fear Nothing"" and its sequel ""Seize the Night""). There's also a fine background regarding Amenabar and his methods in directing the film. I'm not going to explain those previous comments, because I don't want to blab-away any plot-points.

544687,ABBBP0HLLXJZ9,B00003CYLJ,"Rhonda Poynter ""gannon'smom""","[1, 1]","One of the problems with reviewing a film which has been out for awhile is that you want to go into detail on the plot, assuming that most everyone looking it up at this late date - in the case of ""The Others"", almost ten years after its original release - has seen it at least once, and is picking it up for a repeat viewing, a refresher viewing of sorts. But this one has been around long enough where a new audience may, in fact, be finding it for the first time, and so I will try my best not to give out any key surprises to the script, and instead defend it for what it is not - and it is not a horror flick. If you're looking for something that will make you cover your eyes, jump every five minutes or forego the popcorn and other treats because you're assuming the blood spattering and chainsaws will put you just a bit off your appetite, this isn't the movie for you. But this is a very quiet, unsettling film, and it does deliver a few truly unnerving scenes. It's been described in many other reviews as a psychological horror film, and while I agree with the former, I think viewers trying to decide whether or not they'll download/buy it should NOT pay attention to that description. Here's why: Nicole Kidman plays Grace, a woman living with her two children on a country estate in England during wartime; her husband has gone off to fight, and the children, Anne and Nicholas, are very ill with a rare disease which makes them allergic to sunlight. Grace and the children are alone until three servants arrive at the house to assist the family; perhaps it should be said that Grace believes she and her children are alone in the house. The servants are there for other reasons than to simply make lunch and keep the yard up, but Grace is unaware of this, busy worrying about unexplained happenings in the house, her daughter Anne drawing pictures of people she insists are in the house with the family, and the children's illness. In the meantime, Grace ventures outside and into the fog, only to encounter her husband, whom we now realize she had assumed was killed in service. The husband returns to the estate with Grace, but doesn't stay long, and the happenings become more intense, often and dangerous - the curtains are being pulled from the windows, exposing the children to deadly sunlight. Many, many other events occur which an astute viewer may be able to start piecing together,and things culminate with Grace going through the house with a shotgun in hand, the servants explaining why they are actually there, and the children being the key to Grace finally understanding who is who, what is what, and what has happened. Now: That's about as much as I can say without spoiling the film for first timers, but I think I have made my point: There is not one single scene in this film which I think qualifies it as a screamer or horror flick, but I'll say it again - this is one very, very creepy movie, and it is written, directed and acted so well (Alakina Mann, the young girl who plays Anne, hits one right out of the ballpark with her work), that you find yourself getting those tiny little chills up your back that so many movies advertise will be present, and instead you're met with tortured summer campers, buckets of blood and screaming that actually gets boring after awhile. It is a movie that has you thinking from word one, and as you follow what's on screen with the own opinion you're forming - What's really happening here? Who or what are The Others? What more is there to the children's allergy to light? - that when the film does reach its' conclusion, even if you were wrong, you're satisfied because you got knocked for a loop with the twist. I think that this is a great, great movie, and while it did fine in its' original release financially, it went ignored in the awards area in this country. It did, however, win many major awards in Spain, including Best Picture, which may suggest that our neighbors have a better understanding that too much is overkill, and that whispered threat is more effective than howling and chain rattling. The DVD has tons of extras on it, including a fascinating short about the illness noted in the movie, xeroderma pigmentosum, and a feature on director Alejandro Amenabar. Finally, it should be noted that Nicole Kidman does a fine turn as the mother, Grace, and I personally think that she should have been considered for the Oscar in this role, rather than the one (THE HOURS) that she actually won for. Great movie: Remember, please leave your axes, chainsaws and oversexed, screaming campers at the door!",5,Spooky and Stylish!,1287014400,"10 14, 2010",2010,4594,"['One', 'problems', 'reviewing', 'film', 'been', 'out', 'awhile', 'want', 'go', 'detail', 'plot', 'assuming', 'most', 'everyone', 'looking', 'up', 'late', 'date', 'case', 'Others', 'almost', 'ten', 'years', 'original', 'release', 'seen', 'least', 'once', 'picking', 'up', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'refresher', 'viewing', 'sorts', 'one', 'been', 'long', 'enough', 'where', 'new', 'audience', 'may', 'fact', 'be', 'finding', 'first', 'time', 'so', 'will', 'try', 'best', 'not', 'give', 'out', 'key', 'surprises', 'script', 'instead', 'defend', 'what', 'not', 'not', 'horror', 'flick', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'will', 'make', 'cover', 'eyes', 'jump', 'five', 'minutes', 'forego', 'popcorn', 'other', 'treats', ""'re"", 'assuming', 'blood', 'spattering', 'chainsaws', 'will', 'put', 'just', 'bit', 'appetite', ""n't"", 'movie', 'very', 'quiet', 'unsettling', 'film', 'deliver', 'few', 'truly', 'unnerving', 'scenes', 'been', 'described', 'many', 'other', 'reviews', 'psychological', 'horror', 'film', 'agree', 'former', 'think', 'viewers', 'trying', 'decide', 'not', ""'ll"", 'download/buy', 'should', 'NOT', 'pay', 'attention', 'description', 'Here', 'why', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Grace', 'woman', 'living', 'two', 'children', 'country', 'estate', 'England', 'wartime', 'husband', 'gone', 'off', 'fight', 'children', 'Anne', 'Nicholas', 'are', 'very', 'ill', 'rare', 'disease', 'allergic', 'sunlight', 'Grace', 'children', 'are', 'alone', 'three', 'servants', 'arrive', 'house', 'assist', 'family', 'perhaps', 'should', 'be', 'said', 'Grace', 'children', 'are', 'alone', 'house', 'servants', 'are', 'there', 'other', 'reasons', 'simply', 'make', 'lunch', 'keep', 'yard', 'up', 'Grace', 'unaware', 'busy', 'worrying', 'about', 'unexplained', 'happenings', 'house', 'daughter', 'Anne', 'drawing', 'pictures', 'people', 'are', 'house', 'family', 'children', 'illness', 'meantime', 'Grace', 'ventures', 'outside', 'fog', 'only', 'encounter', 'husband', 'whom', 'now', 'realize', 'had', 'assumed', 'was', 'killed', 'service', 'husband', 'returns', 'estate', 'Grace', ""n't"", 'stay', 'long', 'happenings', 'become', 'more', 'intense', 'often', 'dangerous', 'curtains', 'are', 'being', 'pulled', 'windows', 'exposing', 'children', 'deadly', 'sunlight', 'Many', 'many', 'other', 'events', 'occur', 'astute', 'viewer', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'start', 'piecing', 'together', 'things', 'culminate', 'Grace', 'going', 'house', 'shotgun', 'hand', 'servants', 'explaining', 'why', 'are', 'actually', 'there', 'children', 'being', 'key', 'Grace', 'finally', 'understanding', 'who', 'who', 'what', 'what', 'happened', 'Now', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'say', 'spoiling', 'film', 'first', 'timers', 'think', 'have', 'made', 'point', 'not', 'one', 'single', 'scene', 'film', 'think', 'qualifies', 'screamer', 'horror', 'flick', ""'ll"", 'say', 'again', 'one', 'very', 'very', 'creepy', 'movie', 'written', 'directed', 'acted', 'so', 'well', 'Alakina', 'Mann', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'Anne', 'one', 'right', 'ballpark', 'work', 'find', 'getting', 'tiny', 'little', 'chills', 'back', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'advertise', 'will', 'be', 'present', 'instead', ""'re"", 'met', 'tortured', 'summer', 'campers', 'buckets', 'blood', 'screaming', 'actually', 'boring', 'awhile', 'movie', 'thinking', 'word', 'one', 'follow', 'what', 'screen', 'own', 'opinion', ""'re"", 'forming', 'What', 'really', 'happening', 'here', 'Who', 'are', 'Others', 'What', 'more', 'there', 'children', 'allergy', 'light', 'when', 'film', 'reach', 'conclusion', 'even', 'were', 'wrong', ""'re"", 'satisfied', 'got', 'knocked', 'loop', 'twist', 'think', 'great', 'great', 'movie', 'did', 'fine', 'original', 'release', 'financially', 'went', 'ignored', 'awards', 'area', 'country', 'did', 'however', 'win', 'many', 'major', 'awards', 'Spain', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'may', 'suggest', 'neighbors', 'have', 'better', 'understanding', 'too', 'much', 'overkill', 'whispered', 'threat', 'more', 'effective', 'howling', 'chain', 'rattling', 'DVD', 'tons', 'extras', 'including', 'fascinating', 'short', 'illness', 'noted', 'movie', 'xeroderma', 'pigmentosum', 'feature', 'director', 'Alejandro', 'Amenabar', 'Finally', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'fine', 'turn', 'mother', 'Grace', 'personally', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'Oscar', 'role', 'rather', 'one', 'THE', 'HOURS', 'actually', 'won', 'Great', 'movie', 'Remember', 'please', 'leave', 'axes', 'chainsaws', 'screaming', 'campers', 'door']",The Others
544688,A1GG3J0SNY1BQR,B00003CYLJ,Rick,"[3, 3]","""The Others"" has all the makings of a classic thriller: intense atmosphere, superb casting, agonizing suspense, and fine direction. It is the kind of film that would have put a smile on Hitchcock's face.Nicole Kidman shows why she is one of our most talented living actresses in a performance that is among the best of the new century. Not for a moment was I doubtful about her portrayal, nor of any of the others in the cast. The child actors carry their weight superbly as well. No weak links here.The atmosphere, as noted elsewhere, is enriched by shadowing effects, made possible by the interplay of light and darkness in a setting where light becomes disconcerting, distorting our conventional perception.Nothing in the plot is left to chance. So convincing is the plot that the ending will take you aback, puzzle and perhaps confound. This is an intelligent film with a screenplay to contemplate; it is not just another one of those slash-and-gash-cheap-thrills-special-effects-induced horror flicks that pervade the market. Nor is it campy or cultist. It is both artistic and spiritual in its depth of dimension. Moreover, it is that rare thriller that will be almost as good on second showing as the first, if for no other reason than that the viewer will want to retrace the steps, so to speak.Highly recommended for its completeness. But a suggestion here from a former high school English teacher: just before watching it read Walter de la Mare's ""The Listeners,"" then Robert Frost's ""Ghost House.""

544689,A2M66S05KKNSWC,B00003CYLJ,"Rivkah Maccaby ""Rivkah Maccaby""","[5, 6]","Nicole Kidman is astonishing in this film. Honestly, I never thought of her as more than a pretty face, but this film demonstrates her talent. She plays a mother trying to shelter her children from light, because they have a rare condition that makes ordinary sunlight blistering. (There really is a condition like this, by the way.) Her husband is missing in action in WWII, so for help with the children, and her large house, she hires three servants who oddly dress as though they just stepped out of the turn of the last century.Light functions almost as a character in this film. Light hurts the children, light fails to reveal the strangers who may or may not be hiding in the shadows. Light lurks outside each door, waiting for a chance to catch someone unaware, and pounce. The cinematography is excellent, following the mother from room to room, brilliantly capturing her frantic near-panic.The child actors here are unprodigious and ingenuous. They hardly seem to be acting. It's a great relief from the latest vehicle for whatever child actor Hollywood is trying to impose on the viewing public.At its heart, this is a ghost story.

544691,A4FX5YCJA630V,B00003CYLJ,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[2, 2]","On the mist-shrouded, half-abandoned island of Jersey, in an old but beautiful house, waits Grace and her two children for the husband that went off to war and never came home. For a woman living alone in the those days with two children to care for and a missing husband, the stress and fear would have been terrible. But for Grace, the situation is even more dire - her children Anne and Nicolas are photosensitive, and will die if exposed to any light much brighter than a lamp. Therefore the light must be contained - each door must be shut and locked before the next one is opened, and the curtains in each room are constantly drawn whenever the children move about. Usually they are confined to one room, and the restrictive claustrophobia is almost suffocating, for both them and Grace. But to make things even worse, the servents of the house have disappeared inexplictedly in the night, without even collecting their wages a few ago, leaving Grace literally stranded.Why they left is unknown, but the viewer gets the sneaking suspicion that it was Grace herself, with her rules and regulations that border on obsessive complusion, and her devout Catholic upbringing. However, this problem is soon cleared up with the appearence of three new servents that come to the house - Bertha Mills, Edmund Tuttle and a young mute girl named Lydia. It soon becomes clear however, that there is more to these three that mets the eye - Grace's letter requesting new servents never reached the post office - so what are they doing there?Mystery follows mystery as strange happenings begin to arise in the house. Grace's daughter Anne speaks of a young boy named Victor, much to the terror of the younger Nicolas, and though the footsteps and opened doors are first blamed on the servents and the children, soon Grace cannot deny that there are others in the house with them.Nicole Kidman puts on an exquistite performance as the ridgid and strict Grace, gradually becoming unwound by the impossible occurances happening around her. Though many may dislike her strict and often harsh nature toward the children, the director compensates with several softer moments, and it is very clear throughout the plot that she desparately loves both of them. Her entire personality is ruled by circumstance. It is clear that like the servents, she too harbours a secret, as her children keep mysteriously alluding to ""that day"" when supposedly their mother went mad, and who wouldn't under such dreadful and stressful circumstances.The director has struck gold with the casting of Anne and Nicolas. Rather than simply being the children, whose only role is to look scared, they are fundamental to the story and to Grace's state of mind. The eldest, Anne is a real joy - rebelling against her mother continually, first in her outright disbelief in what her Biblical mother preaches to her, and secondly in her stalwart insistence that she is *not* telling her brother scary stories, but there is in fact someone else in the house - warning her that they're threatening to take down the curtains... Mischievous and often malicious, she is closer to ""the others"" than anyone else in the house, much to the upsetting of little Nicolas. Devoted to his mother, yet needful of the presence of his sister, he is shy to his sister's confidence, and fearful to her bravery in regard to the ghosts.""The Others"" was written and directed by Alejandro Amenabar, and he brilliantly brings the spooky atmosphere to life, showing us both the grandeur of the house and the suffocatingly restrictive way of living inside it. In many ways the house itself is a major character, and when it comes to the frightening moments...lets just say I have never been so terrified of the mere sound of footsteps on the second floor.The ending is quite ambiguous, and as the credits role, you're not entirely sure if its a happy ending or not. Instead it is melancoly and hazy, which given the overall atmosphere of the movie is a perfect ending, but left me with more questions than answers. The two main questions raised are what the characters themselves ask. To not give away the story, I can't tell you who is speaking them, but they are ""Why do you remain in this house?"" and ""What does all this mean?"" It presents a new, and not entirely welcome slant on the nature of death, and it would seem by the end that the ghosts are trapped in the house via the fog for all time.Although I adore this movie, and don't mind at all its slow but constant pace, I have to admit that it's not for everyone. My father watched it with me, and though he admitted that it was very clever, he found the only frighting thing about it was the sight of a mentally fragile woman running about the house with a shotgun! If you are a gore and blood person, this movie won't impress you, though if you're imagination is like mine, and you find that what you *don't* see is more terrifying than what you *do*, here is the movie for you.",5,Atmospheric and Evocative - One of my Favourites,1055980800,"06 19, 2003",2003,4968,"['mist-shrouded', 'half-abandoned', 'island', 'Jersey', 'old', 'beautiful', 'house', 'Grace', 'two', 'children', 'husband', 'went', 'war', 'never', 'came', 'home', 'woman', 'living', 'alone', 'days', 'two', 'children', 'care', 'missing', 'husband', 'stress', 'fear', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'terrible', 'Grace', 'situation', 'even', 'more', 'dire', 'children', 'Anne', 'Nicolas', 'are', 'photosensitive', 'will', 'die', 'exposed', 'light', 'much', 'brighter', 'lamp', 'light', 'must', 'be', 'contained', 'door', 'must', 'be', 'shut', 'locked', 'next', 'one', 'opened', 'curtains', 'room', 'are', 'constantly', 'drawn', 'whenever', 'children', 'move', 'Usually', 'are', 'confined', 'one', 'room', 'restrictive', 'claustrophobia', 'almost', 'suffocating', 'Grace', 'make', 'things', 'even', 'worse', 'servents', 'house', 'have', 'disappeared', 'inexplictedly', 'night', 'even', 'collecting', 'wages', 'few', 'ago', 'leaving', 'Grace', 'literally', 'left', 'unknown', 'viewer', 'sneaking', 'suspicion', 'was', 'Grace', 'rules', 'regulations', 'border', 'obsessive', 'complusion', 'devout', 'Catholic', 'upbringing', 'However', 'problem', 'soon', 'cleared', 'up', 'appearence', 'three', 'new', 'servents', 'come', 'house', 'Bertha', 'Mills', 'Edmund', 'Tuttle', 'young', 'mute', 'girl', 'named', 'Lydia', 'soon', 'clear', 'however', 'more', 'three', 'eye', 'Grace', 'letter', 'requesting', 'new', 'servents', 'never', 'reached', 'post', 'office', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'there', 'Mystery', 'mystery', 'strange', 'happenings', 'begin', 'arise', 'house', 'Grace', 'daughter', 'Anne', 'speaks', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Victor', 'much', 'terror', 'younger', 'Nicolas', 'footsteps', 'opened', 'doors', 'are', 'first', 'blamed', 'servents', 'children', 'soon', 'Grace', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'are', 'others', 'house', 'them.Nicole', 'Kidman', 'exquistite', 'performance', 'ridgid', 'strict', 'Grace', 'gradually', 'becoming', 'unwound', 'impossible', 'occurances', 'happening', 'many', 'may', 'dislike', 'strict', 'often', 'harsh', 'nature', 'children', 'director', 'several', 'softer', 'moments', 'very', 'clear', 'plot', 'desparately', 'entire', 'personality', 'ruled', 'circumstance', 'clear', 'servents', 'too', 'secret', 'children', 'keep', 'mysteriously', 'alluding', 'day', 'when', 'supposedly', 'mother', 'went', 'mad', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'such', 'dreadful', 'stressful', 'circumstances.The', 'director', 'struck', 'gold', 'casting', 'Anne', 'Nicolas', 'Rather', 'simply', 'being', 'children', 'only', 'role', 'look', 'scared', 'are', 'fundamental', 'story', 'Grace', 'state', 'mind', 'eldest', 'Anne', 'real', 'joy', 'rebelling', 'mother', 'continually', 'first', 'outright', 'disbelief', 'what', 'Biblical', 'mother', 'preaches', 'secondly', 'stalwart', 'insistence', '*not*', 'telling', 'brother', 'scary', 'stories', 'fact', 'someone', 'else', 'house', 'warning', ""'re"", 'threatening', 'take', 'down', 'curtains', 'Mischievous', 'often', 'malicious', 'closer', 'others', 'anyone', 'else', 'house', 'much', 'upsetting', 'little', 'Nicolas', 'Devoted', 'mother', 'yet', 'needful', 'presence', 'sister', 'shy', 'sister', 'confidence', 'fearful', 'bravery', 'regard', 'ghosts', 'Others', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Alejandro', 'Amenabar', 'brilliantly', 'spooky', 'atmosphere', 'life', 'showing', 'grandeur', 'house', 'suffocatingly', 'restrictive', 'way', 'living', 'many', 'ways', 'house', 'major', 'character', 'when', 'frightening', 'moments', 'just', 'say', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'terrified', 'mere', 'sound', 'footsteps', 'second', 'floor.The', 'ending', 'quite', 'ambiguous', 'credits', 'role', ""'re"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'happy', 'ending', 'not', 'Instead', 'melancoly', 'hazy', 'given', 'overall', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'perfect', 'ending', 'left', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'two', 'main', 'questions', 'raised', 'are', 'what', 'characters', 'ask', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'who', 'speaking', 'are', 'Why', 'do', 'remain', 'house', 'What', 'mean', 'new', 'not', 'entirely', 'welcome', 'slant', 'nature', 'death', 'would', 'seem', 'end', 'ghosts', 'are', 'trapped', 'house', 'fog', 'time.Although', 'adore', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'slow', 'constant', 'pace', 'have', 'admit', 'not', 'everyone', 'father', 'watched', 'admitted', 'was', 'very', 'clever', 'found', 'only', 'frighting', 'thing', 'was', 'sight', 'mentally', 'fragile', 'woman', 'running', 'house', 'shotgun', 'are', 'gore', 'blood', 'person', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'impress', ""'re"", 'imagination', 'mine', 'find', 'what', ""*don't*"", 'see', 'more', 'terrifying', 'what', '*do*', 'here', 'movie']",The Others

Murena Jr. ""tedmurena""","[5, 5]","The Others captivates audiences with its ethereal feel stark yet Aesthetic filming and good, if not great performances on the part of the actors.  Set in the isle of Jersey during WWII the fog never seems to leave the environs: could it be that this mist is more than meets the eye... In a lovely old manor house it is only two children and a Mother along with the caretakers.  And then the haunting begins. Well chances are by now you at least have an idea of what happens.  This actually is a surprisingly good film on several levels and the DVD offers a great amount of extras making it a great value.  With several plot twists good dialogue and well nice cinematography, The Others, while not scary after the first viewing, is certainly an enjoyable film.The actors in this film quite well portray their roles and the children are especially good.  It is so often that a film centered around children suffers from poorly acted juvenile roles.  Luckily this is not one of those films.  Nicole Kidman, who often carries the baggage of celebrity and her earlier roles into her characters, is surprisingly fresh and she pulls off the role of an English lady beautifully and she looks good too.  Beyond this her emotions seem believable and if you watch the film for the first time you will find her surprise and rage to be quite convincing.I rate the movie as a solid four stars because it is somewhat intelligent and doesn't use a lot of cheesy ""shock scenes"" or any ridiculous CGI to keep the audience's interest the film is edited well and though there are parts that might seem slow their isn't much in the way of extraneous footage.  If you haven't yet seen this one certainly do so and if you have I think you will enjoy the many extras offered to you on the DVD version.

His previous works, Thesis and Open Your Eyes, demonstrated Amenabar's ability to use images and sounds to unease an audience and keep you hooked until the last frame. Differing in feel and appearance to Thesis and Open Your Eyes, it is again the style of The Others that is the movie's strongest point. It is a return to the classic techniques of Hitchcock and Wise rather than the easy approach taken by today's directors of slasher and gore fests.The cast is superb, with this being Nicole's finest hour to date. You can feel the tension in her performance and her obsession for her children oozes through every scene. Both Alakina Mann and James Bentley are believeable and convincing as the children with the house and scenery almost characters in their own right.The DVD (2 discs)comes with some wonderful features including an overview of Amenabar's work today.

The location of the house seems ridiculous to me - the island of Jersey is known largely for its good weather (in British terms anyway), so endless fog is unlikely - but this is a gothic type film, so I am being too picky perhaps. The end is nicely done and in a strange way a happy surprise. It could have been much worse. There is a propensity for films to stress the supernatural these days - I just hope that this is not too much of a trend. In my opinion we have one life and we have to make the best of this world - there is no other.

I was bored Nathanial Hawthorne's book House of the Seven Gables and thought many people's favorite &quot;The Haunting&quot; (Yes, the '60s version) was slow moving and more odd than scary. The Other's is not unlike the original &quot;Haunting&quot; in tone so perhaps that is a clue that you might like this film.Overall The Others is a good ghost story offering some fun jump scares and keeps you wondering what is hiding behind the next corner. On the downside it often drags and does not keep its secrets nearly as elegantly as the Sixth Sense. In one sequence Nicole Kidman has an interlude with a male visitor. The film tries but does not successfully make the encounter feel a sad and natural part of a normal story. What happens is too unnatural. It avoided showing things in a way it was obvious to me I was being manipulated to think something other than the truth. I was not hard to guess the rest after that. Still the film has some nice spooky images that follow and I can't fault its more enthusiastic fans for liking it.

I lying in bed with a bad cold, and figured--What the heck, it's a scary movie and Nicole Kidman is in it. Might be ok.By the time THE OTHERS was over, I was bolt upright in bed and feeling the chills, not from my cold but from a perfectly crafted ghost movie. I hadn't felt so absorbed and horrified (in a good sense) since I'd read Bronte's WUTHERING HEIGHTS or James' TURN OF THE SCREW. And I think it's for the same reason a previous reviewer had mentioned: this movie has the feel of a 19th century ghost story and not a 20th century horror story. Not a single drop of blood is spilled. No skeletal or decaying corpse-like spectre threatening violence prowling around here. These &quot;others&quot;--from the other side of life--are an unknowable entity. Nicole Kidman's character is terrified by what the others don't tell her about themselves (once she believes they exist). She doesn't know what they want, and the perceived consequences of that are what fuel the second half of the film. This, combined with the fact that her children have been in touch with the others, yet they can only tell her mother so much, keeps her frustration and vigilance at fever pitch.The gloomy setting, the inscrutible domestic staff, and the constant bickering of the children all add to the suspense.This is an example of quality horror film making.

Actual scares are few and far between. You'll realize the haunted nature of this house isolated on one of the Channel Islands just after World War II - more by soft, suggestive steps.When Nicole Kidman's character explains that her children are photosensitive and have to be shut away from all natural light - the scene is set for flickering candlelight and dark corners.

It's the brilliant way it's all wrapped up.There isn't a lot of essential material on the separate ""Extras"" disc that comes with this Collector's Edition.

One of the most helpful things they've done is to get their children in touch with other children who have the condition.

The setting takes place in an English mansion shortly after WWII.  Grace employs servants who slowly and patiently initiate her into her actual status as a ghost.  Grace uses her detection skills to figure out that there's something off about the servants--and there are inexplicable photographs of them (if I'm remembering correctly--it's been about three or so years since I've seen this movie).  To Grace's horror, she realizes these are pictures taken of people after they have died. For most of the movie, Grace is both confident and rigid about her belief system; towards the end of the movie--after learning she is no longer alive, yet still wanders upon the earth as though she were alive--Grace admits to her children that she doesn't know.  She thought she had all of the answers, but nothing turned out as she expected.  We see from the ghosts' perspective when the housekeeper warns Grace that ""there will be others.""

But for people who enjoyed intelligent thrillers, such as 'The Sixth Sense', this one will definately chill your bones but won't keep you up at night. In this modern age, it's hard to get frightened at the possibility of ghosts but this film brings it home. The film stars Nicole Kidman as a very uptight mother whose two children suffer from a rare disease that keeps them out of the sun and keeps the house dark as night. Three mysterious care-takers arrive but it seems they're not the only ones. When the children begin talking of nighttime visitors and mysterious sounds begin occuring, the family begin to believe they are not alone. The film is clever in giving away only a few clever hints and foreshadowing to the surprise ending. The performances are all great, I especially loved the small children.

Nicole Kidman plays Grace, the lady of the house, a fastidious woman of intense religious faith. Grace suffers from inconsolable grief over her husband's disappearance during the war. Grace welcomes a trio of servants to the house. She mentions that the previous ones just departed without warning one day. Her two children suffer from a rare allergy to sunlight: to protect them the windows must be covered at all times. Things get spooky when little Anne says she speaks to a boy nobody can see... I thought Kidman's performance was quite excellent: she's learned a thing or two as an actress. The suffocating atmosphere is flawlessly photographed by cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe - definitely a first-rate job. Is the story predictible? Rather. But it's done with great style and taste. Makes you feel like a kid again - when you were psychic all the time: when we grow up most of us lose this gift (I haven't) because its deemed childish or foolish. Okay. I'll admit that I like to get out of the thirties and forties sometimes! I was recommended this film by my Amazon friends, and, because I found it reminiscent of THE HAUNTING, THE INNOCENTS & THE UNINVITED, naturally I ate it up.

Monsters are more foul, more hideous than ever, and with the use of computers, almost anything can be created.  And yet, in a twist of irony, it is these very same effect houses that have diminished our ability to be scared by de-sensitizing us to the macabre by making it so readily available.This is why some of the more inventive directors in Hollywood are again turning to more traditional means of filmmaking, focusing on camera effect, light and shadow, and most importantly, story-telling, to achieve bigger screams and better thrills.  &quot;The Others&quot; is a prime example of such a film.Set in the long halls, and lofty rooms of an old English manor, the story tells of a woman and her ill children, living alone and abandoned on an island in the throws of a world war.  The woman, played brilliantly by Nicole Kidman, is met by a trio of housekeepers who arrive unexpectedly at her doorstep.  She invites them in and hires them immediately, explaining the house has been left in disarray since the last set of servants disappeared very unexpectedly.It isn't long before the story really starts to build momentum.  The children, who suffer from an illness that makes sunlight lethal to them, move about the house in darkness, each room's windows carefully covered to avoid exposure.  Relationships begin to develop between the family and the servants, and as they do, so too does the house begin to fill with the sound of the &quot;others&quot; who seem to have taken residence.The story is very simple, almost linear in its development, but its strong focus on developing its characters a layer at a time provide more scares, more edge-of-your-seat than any effect could.  Ironically, there are no obvious special-effects in this film.  It is the masterful use of light and shadow, odd camera angles, and a beautifully written soundtrack that make this film both frightening and genuinely interesting to watch, right up to the suprise ending in the final minutes of the film.",5,Story - NOT Special Effects - Make This Story Scary,1063238400,"09 11, 2003",2003,2247,"['onset', 'big', 'special-effect', 'production', 'houses', 'quot', 'Industrial', 'Light', 'amp', 'Magic', 'quot', 'quot', 'Dreamworks', 'quot', 'have', 'been', 'few', 'movies', 'genre', 'macabre', 'horror', 'have', ""n't"", 'capatilized', 'using', 'visual', 'imagery', 'achieve', 'scares', 'Monsters', 'are', 'more', 'foul', 'more', 'hideous', 'ever', 'use', 'computers', 'almost', 'anything', 'can', 'be', 'created', 'yet', 'twist', 'irony', 'very', 'same', 'effect', 'houses', 'have', 'diminished', 'ability', 'be', 'scared', 'de-sensitizing', 'macabre', 'making', 'so', 'readily', 'available.This', 'why', 'more', 'inventive', 'directors', 'Hollywood', 'are', 'again', 'turning', 'more', 'traditional', 'means', 'filmmaking', 'focusing', 'camera', 'effect', 'light', 'shadow', 'most', 'importantly', 'story-telling', 'achieve', 'bigger', 'screams', 'better', 'thrills', 'quot', 'Others', 'quot', 'prime', 'example', 'film.Set', 'long', 'halls', 'lofty', 'rooms', 'old', 'English', 'manor', 'story', 'tells', 'woman', 'ill', 'children', 'living', 'alone', 'abandoned', 'island', 'throws', 'world', 'war', 'woman', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'met', 'trio', 'housekeepers', 'who', 'arrive', 'unexpectedly', 'doorstep', 'immediately', 'explaining', 'house', 'been', 'left', 'disarray', 'last', 'set', 'servants', 'disappeared', 'very', 'unexpectedly.It', ""n't"", 'long', 'story', 'really', 'build', 'momentum', 'children', 'who', 'suffer', 'illness', 'sunlight', 'lethal', 'move', 'house', 'darkness', 'room', 'windows', 'carefully', 'covered', 'avoid', 'exposure', 'Relationships', 'begin', 'develop', 'family', 'servants', 'do', 'so', 'too', 'house', 'begin', 'fill', 'sound', 'quot', 'others', 'quot', 'who', 'seem', 'have', 'taken', 'residence.The', 'story', 'very', 'simple', 'almost', 'linear', 'development', 'strong', 'focus', 'developing', 'characters', 'layer', 'time', 'more', 'scares', 'more', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'effect', 'could', 'Ironically', 'are', 'obvious', 'special-effects', 'film', 'masterful', 'use', 'light', 'shadow', 'odd', 'camera', 'angles', 'beautifully', 'written', 'soundtrack', 'make', 'film', 'frightening', 'genuinely', 'interesting', 'watch', 'right', 'up', 'suprise', 'ending', 'final', 'minutes', 'film']",The Others

The Others is certainly unlike most horror films of the modern era, far more reliant on it's creepy atmosphere and mysterious plot than graphic violence and blood and gore like many other horror films made nowadays do. It follows a mother named Grace (Nicole Kidman) and her two children Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), who live in an old gothic mansion on a small fogbound British Isle just after the end of World War 2. Grace's husband had left the family, become a soldier fighting for England, and apparently died on the battlefield, although he appears in the middle of the film, still alive though clearly traumatized by his experiences in the war, with a distant, haunted look in his eye. His wounds are both physical and mental, and he soon leaves the family once more, apparently because he thinks the war is not yet over. There are also three housekeepers who come to stay with the family, an old Irish woman named Mrs. Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), a similarly old Irish man named Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes), and a young mute woman named Lydia (Elaine Cassidy). What keeps from awarding this atmospheric masterpiece five stars is the fact that the character of Grace is incredibly stubborn and not very likable, at least not at first, and so it prevented me from fully sympathizing with her character, although I'm fully aware that she was made like that for a reason.

No senseless nudity, foul language or gouged eyeballs here - but fear reminiscent of the George C. Scott thriller, ""The Changeling"" or more recently, ""The Sixth Sense.""Nicole Kidman's acting is so impressive, as is the acting of the entire cast, you will find yourself on the edge of your seat. Set in post World War II England, Kidman's character, Grace,  lives in a large mansion on a posh estate. Her two children, Anne and Nicholas, suffer from a rare genetic anomoly that makes them sensitive to light beyond that of a strong lamp. Pure sunlight - even ambient light can raise blisters on their skin and ala Dracula, will kill them.Grace pines over her missing husband who never returned from battling the Germans, yet is not a confirmed MIA or KIA casualty. She finds herself housebound, unable to mingle with anyone in polite society or travel anywhere out of fear for her children's safety.Acustomed to being without electricity during the German bombardments throughout the war, Grace has decided to leave the luxury turned off, depending on heavy curtains to block out the light during the day and using oil lamps at night.Grace tells her 3 house servants that her daughter, Anne, has a vivid imagination who tells of ghastly eyeless women and an invisible boy named Victor. Grace repeatedly punishes Anne for lying... but soon she realizes there really might be 'others' living in the house with them.Whispering voices, creaky floors and other things that go bump in the night have you on your mental toes to figure out who might be dead, who might be alive and if one or more of the characters is just plain nuts and imagining the whole thing.I must admit, this is not my favorite genre. I do not belive there are earth-bound spirits of the previously living people walking around in people's homes - so it's not like at the end when all the loose ends got tied up that I had chills going up my spine - but if you had an experience like that with ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""The Changeling,"" this movie will not disappoint.Having an intelligent storyline, superb acting and all devoid of rampant sex and toilet humor is a welcome relief compared to most movie fare coming out of today's Hollywood. While there are many scene changes in the large manor, the closed rooms and constant darkness and chiaroscuro lighting give the viewer a very claustrophobic feeling to the point you feel Grace's almost psychotic desperation and feeling of being trapped. Even the few moments when you see her outside the manor, the dense, eerie fog furthers the trapped sensation of the viewer and the characters.The acting of Alakina Mann (Anne) and James Bentley (Nicholas) cannot be understated in making this more of an experience than a film.

With a superb cast, particularly Nicole Kidman, a strong script, Amen&aacute;bar's directorial talents, skillful cinematography and an effective musical score (also by Amen&aacute;bar), The Others uses subtlety and atmosphere rather than cheap stunts and intrusive special effects to tell a hauntingly effective story.The film, set in an isolated island manor just after WWII, tells the story of a struggling overprotective mother (Kidman) who lives with her son (James Bentley) and daughter (wonderfully played by young Alakina Mann), both of whom suffer from a rare allergy to light (called Xeroderma Pigmentosum; a real disease). Abandoned by the manor staff, her husband apparently lost in the war, Kidman's character is obviously reaching the end of her tether.The story really begins when the new staff, led by housekeeper/nanny Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), arrive on Kidman's doorstep ready to start work. After explaining their duties to them, as well as the unusual precautions that must be followed at all times to protect her children from light, The Others slowly but surely grows in emotional intensity until a frightening but rewarding climax.Note: The DVD set offers no commentary track, but it does include some additional material, including a ""making of"" featurette and a documentary on Xeroderma Pigmentosum that some may find interesting.",4,"This is an elegiac, yet frightening, instant classic.",1022803200,"05 31, 2002",2002,1610,"['told', 'ghost', 'story', 'atmosphere', 'period', 'detail', 'Innocents', '1961', 'twists', 'assurance', 'Sixth', 'Sense', '1999', '.Written', 'directed', 'Alejandro', 'Amen', 'aacute', 'bar', 'Others', 'sure', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'classic', 'superb', 'cast', 'particularly', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'strong', 'script', 'Amen', 'aacute', 'bar', 'directorial', 'talents', 'skillful', 'cinematography', 'effective', 'musical', 'score', 'also', 'Amen', 'aacute', 'bar', 'Others', 'subtlety', 'atmosphere', 'rather', 'cheap', 'stunts', 'intrusive', 'special', 'effects', 'tell', 'hauntingly', 'effective', 'story.The', 'film', 'set', 'isolated', 'island', 'manor', 'just', 'WWII', 'story', 'struggling', 'overprotective', 'mother', 'Kidman', 'who', 'son', 'James', 'Bentley', 'daughter', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'young', 'Alakina', 'Mann', 'whom', 'suffer', 'rare', 'allergy', 'light', 'called', 'Xeroderma', 'Pigmentosum', 'real', 'disease', 'Abandoned', 'manor', 'staff', 'husband', 'apparently', 'lost', 'war', 'Kidman', 'character', 'obviously', 'reaching', 'end', 'tether.The', 'story', 'really', 'when', 'new', 'staff', 'led', 'housekeeper/nanny', 'Mrs.', 'Mills', 'Fionnula', 'Flanagan', 'arrive', 'Kidman', 'doorstep', 'ready', 'start', 'work', 'explaining', 'duties', 'as', 'well', 'unusual', 'precautions', 'must', 'be', 'followed', 'times', 'protect', 'children', 'light', 'Others', 'slowly', 'surely', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'frightening', 'rewarding', 'climax.Note', 'DVD', 'set', 'commentary', 'track', 'include', 'additional', 'material', 'including', 'making', 'featurette', 'documentary', 'Xeroderma', 'Pigmentosum', 'may', 'find', 'interesting']",The Others

Highly strung, fanatically religious war widow Grace (Nicole Kidman) lives in an isolated big old house on the Channel Islands with her two children who both have a rare medical condition that makes all but the faintest light extremely harmful for them. And with three servants who turn up rather bizarrely on her doorstep. And perhaps that isn't all. For the children, especially her little girl, are starting to encounter some others, a little boy called Victor, his parents, an old lady.It would  be misleading to call this a horror film. It's a real proper ghost story right bang in the tradition of those great literary ghost stories from Victorian and Edwardian England. It's consistently and wonderfully atmospheric and extremely chilling with some of the most brilliantly scariest scenes to be found in any movie: the bedroom scene with Victor at the curtains, the communion dress scene - if you've seen it you'll know what I mean; if not, you'll find out. And it passes the test most scary movies fail of staying scary on repeated viewings. Absolutely first class hide-behind-the-sofa or watch-through-the gaps-between-your-fingers material. Everything is just right. The deliciously creepy atmosphere is perfectly sustained by Javier Aguirresarobe's cinematography and Amenabar's direction. (The preposterously talented Amenabar also wrote both the script and the music.) And the acting is stunning. Kidman is on her very top form. Fionnula Flanagan is perfect as the knowing old nanny Mrs Mills. And, boy oh boy, where did they find those children: James Bentley as Nicholas and utterly superb Alakina Mann as Anne? It's a wonderful film (and, I'm sorry people, but let's be serious, it's a hundred times better the The silly old  Sixth Sense.) M. R.

544729,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B00003CYLJ,S. Schell,"[4, 5]","For a film that reeks of ""The Sixth Sense"" (the M. Night Shyamalan juggernaut that set a new precedent for paranormal movies), ""The Others"" still manages to hold its own with a talented cast, excellent and subtle visual effects and a rousing ghost story that like the above mentioned film, contains a predictable yet entertaining twist.Oscar-winning actress Nicole Kidman is Grace, a young woman living in the seclusion of the Channel Islands during the close of World War II.  Her grand estate has mysteriously emptied itself of each and every one of its servants and with her husband on the front line in France, she is forced to take matters into her own hands and hire an entirely new staff. Before she has even placed an ad in the paper, a man and two women show up at her stoop one misty morning looking for work.  Bertha Mills (Flanagan), Mr. Tuttle (Sykes) and Lydia (Cassidy) all previously served in Grace's household years ago when another family occupied its grand quarters.  Relieved by their familiarity with the grounds, Grace hires them with nary an inquisition.  All she asks of them is their strict attention to the invariable darkness, for Nicolas (Bentley) and Anne (Mann), her two young children, are inflicted with a rare disease that makes them allergic to sunlight - too much exposure can prove fatal.Once all are settled and the house makes it slow recovery from disrepair, strange goings-on begin to occur.  Noises are heard, unidentified voices whisper through the dark hallways and Nicolas and Anne are harassed by an entity named Victor, a young spirit with whom Anne has conversed on several occasions.  An ardent Catholic, Grace is skeptical about the possibility of the house being haunted and passes Anne's and Nicolas's allegations off as outrageous stories, forcing them to repent for so-called lies by reading passages out of the bible for hours on end.  All the while, Grace fights her own battle with loneliness and the steady slip of her sanity, her grief over the extensive absence of her husband Charles (Eccleston) and the pressure of caring for two children on her own pushing her to the edge.Director Alejandro Amenabar literally had carte blanche when he did this picture - not only did he direct, but he wrote the screenplay and composed the entire original score, a combination of haunting and beautiful compositions.  For a 28-year-old director who was flattered by the 2001 remake of his film ""Obre Los Ojos"" (""Vanilla Sky"") and assumed three major aspects of a motion picture, Amenabar is not just multi-talented - he's an entrepreneur.In a film like this, lighting and sound are integral and they become metaphoric as well.  It is used to great effect by Amenabar - we are at first almost completely in the dark about the truth.  Then, slowly, as more light is poured upon it, we begin to see bit by bit the terrible secret that Grace and her children have been hiding all this time.  Shadows are aplenty here and the more there are the scarier it is, the viewer's eyes playing just as many tricks on them as the characters.  When there is light, it is either stark and blinding or finely covered with cloud and haze, in keeping with the characters' inability to see beyond the present.  In order to get the best scares out of his audience, Amenabar keeps the score quiet and illusive, at times completely absent so that the creaks and bumps of the vast manor are all the more disquieting.There isn't a bad performance to be found here, the movie filled with talented newcomers and favored veterans.  Kidman, now an Oscar winner for ""The Hours"", is the stand-out as Grace, a woman who inwardly endures immense despair and hides her tortured heart from the world with a steely front and her staunch faith.  Also excellent are Fionnula Flanagan (Waking Ned Devine) as the warm-hearted Mrs. Mills and Alakina Mann as the headstrong Anne - Mann has to be one of the least precocious and most talented child actors I've seen in a while.  I hope she gets more work.The Dimension Collector's Series 2-disc edition has some interesting bonus material, in particular the Visual Effects Piece which shows all the different layers of digital effects used to create the spooky environs of the mansion and its grounds.

The house, it's furnishings, and the characters wardrobe throughout are a testament to its time period. The ending was a real surprise. Always have questions and there are no answers (unless there's a book this movie was based on, I don't know). Like, how could they only see, hear, or be aware of the presence of ""the others"" only at certain times? If they were there all the time, wouldn't it have been more obvious? The ending, helped me to understand some things along the way. Quite a surprising ending too. I wish there was less whispered dialog. It adds to the creepiness and drama of this film, but it was a bit difficult to hear at times and I know I missed a lot because of that.

544735,A3U56M0Y8LYO6J,B00003CYLJ,"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict""","[5, 5]","Alejandro Amenabar's &quot;The Others&quot; is a reminder that very good films need not be glitzy or gimmicky.  Neither is an excess of special effects or action sequences required.  Film is an exercise in storytelling and good films succeed in telling their story well no matter how small and quaint the film may appear to be.Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) and her two children, Nicholas (James Bentley) and Anne (Alakina Mann), live in a manor off the British coast.  Three strangers arrive one day in answer to a placed advertisement for domestic help.  For some strange reason, the three strangers prove to be familiar with Grace's house.  Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), Lydia (Elaine Cassidy), and the gardener Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes) soon immerse themselves in the daily routine of the manor, but the mood of the house suddenly seems changed with them around.  Is there something to the strangers or is Grace's imagination just getting the better of her?&quot;The Others&quot; revels in its simplicity.  This is a film reminiscent of an earlier era in terms of filmmaking craft but it does not at all feel like a time-displaced relic when viewed through the filter of modern sensibilities.  A legitimately unsettling atmosphere is created under the deft direction of Amenabar and Kidman is granted a wonderful opportunity to put her acting talents on display.  She takes full advantage of her chance to carry a film on her own and succeeds admirably.  Kidman is the emotional and dramatic catalyst of the story and the film as a whole would have been far less effective had she faltered.  Flanagan, Cassidy, and Sykes are also great as the sweet but creepy strangers.  From the outset, we know that there is something amiss by their arrival on the scene but we cannot put our finger on it.  A tip of the hat to Amenabar for keeping us in suspense until the very end.

As one earlier reviewer has observed, you can figure out one major plot twist about halfway through, but I think you're supposed to.  When the missing and presumed dead husband turns up walking and acting like a zombie, and says he's come to say goodbye, it becomes obvious when Kidman throws her arms around him that either he's still alive (unlikely) or that neither of them are.  But the question still remains to be resolved, who are these frightening &quot;others&quot; in the house that no one except the little girl can see, and what are they doing there?  The final twist was very effective, IMHO, and surprised me even though I had seen The Sixth Sense.  What really makes this movie work, however, isn't just the story, which would have fallen apart in lesser hands, but the excellent direction and performances by the entire cast, with special kudos to Kidman, who creates a wonderfully ambiguous character, and a couple of excellent child actors.

At first it seemed fairly standard, leaning heavily on TURN OF THE SCREW for its inspiration (and I'm not a big fan of TURN OF THE SCREW). I couldn't figure out why Nicole Kidman, an A-list actress, would have chosen to do a derivative horror film. She was good, but to my eye, not as outstanding as other reviewers have said. But she was fine with the children, and the three servants were excellent - and spooky.As the story spun out, though, it became clear that more was happening than it seemed at first. The tension level ratcheted up, and every scene held clues that would make sense later.Without going any further, let's say that I was rocked by the ending - and by the brilliant buildup that had given the audience all the information we needed while misleading us all the way.A simply terrific film I would definitely see again (I'm a sucker for beautifully written stories with great twists).

544740,A1HS9F7J51E9CB,B00003CYLJ,sweetmolly,"[13, 14]","This eerie, candlelit film mostly taking place in a large but claustrophobic manor house exerts a static pressure that is relentless.  So many doors and all must be locked, unlocked, and relocked.  Curtains must be closed at all times, then drawn tighter lest a ray of lights gets through.  The two children of the house have a rare genetic allergy to light (Polymorphic Light Reaction Syndrome) and can suffer blisters, boils, even 3rd degree burns if exposed to sunlight.  The time is 1945, the mother and children are alone in the house, the husband/father is missing in action, presumed deadWhile the credits roll, the mother, Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) is reading to the children by candlelight.  All are seated around a table presenting a homey, if somewhat shadowy, scene.  The movie formally begins with a petrifying scream by Grace jolted awake from a nightmare in her pleasant sun-filled bedroom.  She quickly dresses and rushes to answer the doorbell.  Nicole Kidman convinces in a glance that her character is strung out taut as a bowstring, but striving to contain her many fears and anxieties.  She dresses in a dowdy manner---skirt a bit long, dowdy shoes, and sensible tweeds.  She has a remarkable resemblance to the late Grace Kelly in this film, which I think shows Kidman's forensic abilities.  Kidman is naturally graceful, which Kelly was not.  The mother's edgy movements and slight awkwardness heighten her fragility and rigid inflexibility.A strange trio greets her at the door who inform her they have come in response to her need for servants.  (Grace has not yet advertised).  They are housekeeper Mrs. Mills (the marvelous Fionnula Flanagan, who is presently appearing in the Divine Secrets of the YaYa Sisterhood in a completely different type of role), a Gardner, and a mute girl-of-all-work.  Grace, though flustered, immediately shows them around and explains their complicated duties.  They meet the two children who are quickly drawn to the kindly Ms. Mills.  The little girl Anne (Alakina Mann) is especially commendable for her perfect balance of sweetness, suspicions, and stubbornness that always seem just right for a very bright little girl.Particularly grating on the mother is the ghostly goings on in the old house.  Music plays, doors open and shut, footsteps are heard, and the children refer to a boy named Victor who visits them.  These occurrences are almost too much for the mother who has an unbending, fundamental, religious outlook.  The servants obviously know a lot more than they are saying about what is going on in the house.This somber, almost stately film has a jolting crash of a conclusion.  So startling was this finale, the moviegoer does not even have time to grasp the consequences---and it is over.  An excellent film.

544750,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,B00003CYLJ,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[2, 3]","Director:  Alejandro AmenabarCast:  Nicole Kidman, Fionnula Flanagan, Christopher Eccleston, Alakina Mann, James Bentley, Eric Sykes, Elaine Cassidy, Renee Asherson, Gordon Reid, Keith Allen, Michelle Fairley.Running Time:  104 minutesRated PG-13 for thematic elements and frightening moments.In the critically acclaimed ""The Others"", Nicole Kidman is Grace, an emphatically religious woman, devoted to her two creepy children, who appear to be afflicted with a severe sensitivity to light, so much so that they can not handle anything more than candlelight (which conveniently allows for lots of dark atmosphere to occupy the film). Every door in her huge, cavernous Victorian mansion off the coast of England must be closed and locked before the next can be opened, in order to prevent any light from leaking into a room where her children may be. Grace's husband is off fighting in World War II, which, strangely has just come to an end when the film opens. Of course, the audience can pretty much deduce that the poor guy has died during battle. Out of nowhere enter three domestic servants, apparently arriving to replace the previous three domestic servants who have abruptly and mysteriously disappeared one week earlier.  Things seem to be going along rather smoothly: servants tending to the house and kids (especially the bratty daughter, played to spine-tingly perfection by Alakina Mann) and Grace frantically opening and closing doors. Then doors open by themselves, curtains, once drawn, are oddly pulled back with no one in the room to do so, Grace and her kids (mostly the daughter) start hearing weird noises that seem to indicate the presence of others in the house. Ghosts? Maybe, but Grace will hear none of that nonsense. She just keeps telling her kids to shut up and stop lying to her about the noises.  Obviously, these noises aren't the imagination of the children and Grave soon learns that some her biggest fears are now a reality.Co-produced by Tom Cruise (Kidman's husband at the time) and filmed in Spain with an international cast, ""The Others"" marked the English-language debut of Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar, previously responsible for such high profile Spanish entries as ""Thesis"" and ""Open Your Eyes"". Amen&aacute;bar's film aspires to Jamesian sophistication, rejecting bombast for subtlety at every turn, as Kidman's troubled heroine struggles to identify the source of her supernatural experiences (are they real, or just a figment of her overheated imagination?). Kidman is too young for the role, and lacks the necessary gravitas, but she plays it with a fair degree of brittle dignity, particularly in her scenes with Mann, the most confrontational of her children, who is either a malicious prankster intent on frightening her younger brother with manufactured ghost stories, or is genuinely in contact with something sinister lurking within the house.  Like ""The Sixth Sense"" before it, ""The Others"" prides itself on a series of climactic 'revelations', some of which tip their hand too early, but Amen&aacute;bar's screenplay has more than a few surprises in store, especially on second viewing, when the multilayered dialogue is revealed as a masterful patchwork of irony and misdirection. Stage actress Fionnula Flanagan is appropriately enigmatic as Kidman's stoical housekeeper, and there's strong support from Christopher Eccleston and veteran comedian Eric Sykes (here playing it very straight indeed). Beautiful, atmospheric sets by Benjam&iacute;n Fern&aacute;ndez, photographed with exquisite grace by Javier Aguirresarobe.With ""The Others"", Amenabar gives us a truly spooky and stylish thriller. The foggy atmosphere outside of the mansion, the dark rooms lit by candles within the house, both of these are just many of the beautiful stylistic areas of the film. The actors who play Grace's children are actually quite good themselves, particularly Alakina Mann, who holds her own in her confrontational scenes with Kidman and others. The screenplay, also written by Amenabar is quite intelligent, and if you haven't heard the 'twist' at the end, it is pretty ingenious. It is ingenious and well-written regardless, but the impact upon discovery is pretty decent.  ""The Others"" is not a phenomenal film by any means, but it is a refreshing change from the standard thriller/suspense fare, because it adds a truly intelligent and stylish bent to the genre. Other than children, (obviously) this film can be recommended to pretty much anyone, as long as they don't expect it to be the frenetic, jump-cut fest that is so prevalent nowadays. ""The Others"" takes its time to get to its reveal, and for the most part it is worth every minute.",3,The Others  (2001),1136073600,"01 1, 2006",2006,4687,"['Director', 'Alejandro', 'AmenabarCast', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Fionnula', 'Flanagan', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'Alakina', 'Mann', 'James', 'Bentley', 'Eric', 'Sykes', 'Elaine', 'Cassidy', 'Renee', 'Asherson', 'Gordon', 'Reid', 'Keith', 'Allen', 'Michelle', 'Fairley.Running', 'Time', '104', 'minutesRated', 'PG-13', 'thematic', 'elements', 'frightening', 'moments.In', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'Others', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Grace', 'emphatically', 'religious', 'woman', 'devoted', 'two', 'creepy', 'children', 'who', 'appear', 'be', 'afflicted', 'severe', 'sensitivity', 'light', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'not', 'handle', 'anything', 'more', 'candlelight', 'conveniently', 'lots', 'dark', 'atmosphere', 'occupy', 'film', 'door', 'huge', 'cavernous', 'Victorian', 'mansion', 'coast', 'England', 'must', 'be', 'closed', 'locked', 'next', 'can', 'be', 'opened', 'order', 'prevent', 'light', 'leaking', 'room', 'where', 'children', 'may', 'be', 'Grace', 'husband', 'off', 'fighting', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'strangely', 'just', 'come', 'end', 'when', 'film', 'course', 'audience', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'deduce', 'poor', 'guy', 'died', 'battle', 'nowhere', 'enter', 'three', 'domestic', 'servants', 'apparently', 'arriving', 'replace', 'previous', 'three', 'domestic', 'servants', 'who', 'have', 'abruptly', 'mysteriously', 'disappeared', 'one', 'week', 'earlier', 'Things', 'seem', 'be', 'going', 'rather', 'smoothly', 'servants', 'tending', 'house', 'kids', 'especially', 'bratty', 'daughter', 'played', 'spine-tingly', 'perfection', 'Alakina', 'Mann', 'Grace', 'frantically', 'opening', 'closing', 'doors', 'Then', 'doors', 'open', 'curtains', 'once', 'drawn', 'are', 'oddly', 'pulled', 'back', 'one', 'room', 'do', 'so', 'Grace', 'kids', 'mostly', 'daughter', 'start', 'hearing', 'weird', 'noises', 'seem', 'indicate', 'presence', 'others', 'house', 'Ghosts', 'Maybe', 'Grace', 'will', 'hear', 'none', 'nonsense', 'just', 'telling', 'kids', 'shut', 'up', 'stop', 'lying', 'noises', 'Obviously', 'noises', 'are', ""n't"", 'imagination', 'children', 'Grave', 'soon', 'biggest', 'fears', 'are', 'now', 'reality.Co-produced', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Kidman', 'husband', 'time', 'filmed', 'Spain', 'international', 'cast', 'Others', 'marked', 'English-language', 'debut', 'Alejandro', 'Amen', 'aacute', 'bar', 'previously', 'responsible', 'such', 'high', 'profile', 'Spanish', 'entries', 'Thesis', 'Open', 'Eyes', 'Amen', 'aacute', 'bar', 'film', 'aspires', 'Jamesian', 'sophistication', 'rejecting', 'bombast', 'subtlety', 'turn', 'Kidman', 'troubled', 'heroine', 'identify', 'source', 'supernatural', 'experiences', 'are', 'real', 'just', 'figment', 'overheated', 'imagination', 'Kidman', 'too', 'young', 'role', 'necessary', 'gravitas', 'fair', 'degree', 'brittle', 'dignity', 'particularly', 'scenes', 'Mann', 'most', 'confrontational', 'children', 'who', 'malicious', 'prankster', 'intent', 'frightening', 'younger', 'brother', 'manufactured', 'ghost', 'stories', 'genuinely', 'contact', 'something', 'sinister', 'lurking', 'house', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Others', 'series', 'climactic', ""'revelations"", 'tip', 'hand', 'too', 'early', 'Amen', 'aacute', 'bar', 'screenplay', 'more', 'few', 'surprises', 'store', 'especially', 'second', 'viewing', 'when', 'multilayered', 'dialogue', 'revealed', 'masterful', 'patchwork', 'irony', 'misdirection', 'Stage', 'actress', 'Fionnula', 'Flanagan', 'appropriately', 'enigmatic', 'Kidman', 'stoical', 'housekeeper', 'strong', 'support', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'veteran', 'comedian', 'Eric', 'Sykes', 'here', 'playing', 'very', 'straight', 'indeed', 'Beautiful', 'atmospheric', 'sets', 'Benjam', 'iacute', 'Fern', 'aacute', 'photographed', 'exquisite', 'grace', 'Javier', 'Aguirresarobe.With', 'Others', 'Amenabar', 'truly', 'spooky', 'stylish', 'thriller', 'foggy', 'atmosphere', 'mansion', 'dark', 'rooms', 'lit', 'candles', 'house', 'are', 'just', 'many', 'beautiful', 'stylistic', 'areas', 'film', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'Grace', 'children', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'particularly', 'Alakina', 'Mann', 'who', 'own', 'confrontational', 'scenes', 'Kidman', 'others', 'screenplay', 'also', 'written', 'Amenabar', 'quite', 'intelligent', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', ""'twist"", 'end', 'pretty', 'ingenious', 'ingenious', 'well-written', 'regardless', 'impact', 'discovery', 'pretty', 'decent', 'Others', 'not', 'phenomenal', 'film', 'means', 'refreshing', 'change', 'standard', 'thriller/suspense', 'fare', 'truly', 'intelligent', 'stylish', 'bent', 'genre', 'Other', 'children', 'obviously', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'recommended', 'pretty', 'much', 'anyone', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'frenetic', 'jump-cut', 'fest', 'so', 'prevalent', 'nowadays', 'Others', 'time', 'get', 'reveal', 'most', 'part', 'worth', 'minute']",The Others

544753,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00003CYLJ,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[9, 9]","I waited a long time to see ""The Others"" but only because it was playing at all of the worst, most inconvenient theaters in LA. I was waiting for the opportunity to see it on a somewhat respectable screen, to enhance my viewing experience. I fully believe that the screen and theater play a big part in the overall enjoyment of a film. If you see an OK film at a shoebox theater, you will likely report that the film was no good. If you see a bad film at a good theater, you will probably enjoy the film a little more. Over the Labor Day Weekend, I found myself on vacation, with a few hours on my hand, and `The Others' playing at a theater nearby. Unfortunately, the theater was one of the absolute worst that I have ever been in, so it may have colored my judgement a little. Note to theater goers: It is absolutely the most inconsiderate thing in the world to bring a cell phone to a movie theater and take calls during the film. It is inconceivably inconsiderate to take calls on a cell phone that lights up, casting shadows and a laser light show throughout the small, darkened theater. If this happened once, I could understand the mistake, but three or four times? Turn your damn cell phones and pagers off. People can call you back after the movie!Now, about the movie...Grace (Nicole Kidman) and her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley) live in an old mansion on Jersey, an island off the English coast, during World War II. Grace, a puritanical woman, devoutly quoting the bible, teaches her children at home and in fact won't let them go into a room in which the sun is shining. Each child has a rare condition which can kill them if they are exposed to sunlight. Grace closes the curtains of each room as they move through, to protect them. Naturally, both Grace and the children become a little sick of being confined to the house. The perpetual fog outside does little to alleviate anyone's spirits. Grace and the children are also concerned about the whereabouts of the man of the family, Charles (Christopher Eccleston). He went off to fight in the war, but has not been heard from since, and the war has been over for at least a year. One day, three people show up on the doorstep to answer Grace's ad for domestic help. The previous three servants simply disappeared a week before. They are: Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flannagan), Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) and Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes). About the same time, Grace and the children begin hearing noises.""The Others"", written and directed by Alejandro Amenabar, is a haunted house film like they used to make, more similar to the original ""The Haunting"" or any other good horror film. The filmmaker relies on acting and storytelling to create an atmosphere of fright and horror, eschewing all CGI and gross-out tricks. How refreshing!Nicole Kidman has now created two films in a row that any actor would like to be remembered for. In my eyes, this is a huge achievement. Previously, I couldn't stand her. Every role made her seem like an ice princess. Only ""To Die For"" showed any acting ability and even this role did nothing for her personality. Now with ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""The Others"", Kidman is showing both range and warmth, shattering previous conceptions of her. Both films show an actress with amazing ability.Fionnula Flanagan, Elaine Cassidy and Eric Sykes are all very effective as the competent, but at times, mysterious help who arrive mysteriously. Their characters are most effective when they aren't revealing things to the audience. This was a mistake on Amenabar's part, as it reveals too much of their characters. It is always better to keep the audience in the dark for as long as possible.Alakina Mann and James Bentley are especially effective as Grace's children. Never able to run and play, they seem perfect as they try to remain in their mother's good graces. As they talk of `mother's episodes', we don't know if they are simply telling tall tales or revealing something that we should really pay attention to.The cinematography and set design help to create an atmosphere of confusion and dread. The fog surrounding the house serves to confine them further. As Grace fanatically moves from one room to the next, closing curtains, to shield the children from light, she herself creates an atmosphere of dread that we as the audience never seem to be able to escape.A lot has been said of the `big twist' at the end. The less said about this, the better. Most reviews of this film compare the big twist to another very memorable big twist in another very memorable film. If you know what this previous twists is, you can pretty much figure out the twist in ""The Others"", which is too bad.A lot has also been said about the film being too slow. I didn't find it slow at all. The suspense and tension build as we learn more about the story and the characters. I don't think it is necessary or relevant for every film to have quick or MTV-like editing. It wouldn't be appropriate to this story and I am thankful that they didn't use it here.""The Others"" is a chilling, frightening old-fashioned haunted house film.

The result is a family that lives a dark, dreary, yet highly-strung existence.  The father went away to WWII, and did not return when it ended.  One senses throughout that each character is waiting for something to happen--something to break the horrid state they find themselves in.  Into the picture come three domestic servants, responding to an advertisement to replace the three that left suddenly.  These new helpers are quiet, and mysterious.  They seem to know much, but are careful to let fate take its course.  The mother soon discovers that her new domestic servants had not responded to a published help wanted notice, because the postman never picked up the request.Kidman plays her deeply conflicted character with a combination of force and poise that is amazing.

The movie starts off kind of slow, which got me thinking at first that this was going to be real sleeper. But being the patient person that I am and having an attention span longer than that of a fruit fly I kept watching.  I guess what perked my interest to continue watching was when Grace tells her three new servants that every door must be locked first before another is opened. My eyebrow went up that point. I mean how strange! It seemed like a superstitious thing at first, but then Grace explains that her children are photosensitive (thus, making it so that no light must be able to enter any part of the house). I have to say when Grace went inside the room to retrieve her sleeping children I expected her to bring back two little gremlins or something. They way she acted and talked to the servants about the house ( &quot;You will find there are many things about this house that are unusual&quot; or something to that effect) kind of helps to set the tone for the movie's creepy aire. That in addition to its dark cinematology and lighting.The movie defintely gave me chills and caused me to pull up the covers of my blanket a couple of times. Nicole Kidman gave a pretty good performance as she slowly began to doubt her sanity -after a few strange happenings of slamming doors and stomping  of footsteps up above - mainly due to her rigid, stern personality. This keeps her from being able consider other possibilities and look for the answers that are right before her eyes. After seeing the ending I don't want to say to much about the movie, because it will only dull any of you newbies to the suspense.

544762,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00003CYLJ,Tsuyoshi,"[10, 11]","Yesterday, on April 28, we have finally seen the theatrical release of this masterpiece in Japan, and the waiting time was very, very long.  But it was worth of our patience.  ""The Others"" is not only a chilling and scary movie; it is crafted with style and intelligence, and it is fantastic to watch the director (who is still below the age of 30!!) create this piece of art.As you probably have known by now, beautiful Nicole Kidman  plays Grace, whose children are allergic to light (and this disaease really exists, you should know).  With ritual-like meticulous rules, she manages her household works, employing new servants in a huge, dreary countryhouse, which ever-hanging fogs mystriously surround.  But there is (or are), she comes to know, some intruder(s) here, of which existence her children are convinced.  And sooner or later, Grace comes to feel that, too.It is a natural but unfair comparison if you point out that ""The Others"" resembles at some places a certain Oscar-nominated film, because the director Amenabar does it with completely different touch.  I cannot tell you much, but let me say, like Hitchcock's classic ""Rebecca,"" the heroine (and the audience) is lured inexplicably into the mystery of the old house and its past.  Also using the classic frameworks of ghost stories used in the original ""Haunting"" (Robert Wise version, NOT THAT remake), the film makes us jumping in the seats, sending lots of chill in spine, and, moreover, it treats a universal subject of love between mother and children in a subtle fashion.  On top of that, the film goes further, to make the mother Grace not exactly an ideal one for kids, and it succeeds eventually in depicting the fraility of humans -- in short, you really don't know what you think you know.Anchored by strong and believable acting given from underrated Nicole Kidman (why did Oscar ignore her work here, preferring  that musical ... well, but all right, I understand), and aided effectively by other well-cast players whose uncanny presence unnerve us greatly, ""The Others"" will rivet your eyes on the screen, especially when you are a connoisseur of old-fashioned horror film.  Keep your eyes open when you see the details of the film: furniture, photoes, everything.  Something is wrong with this house, but how and what is not clear.  This bizzare sensation is another asset of the film, and you will find what you missed with repeated viewing.For those who have enjoyed this (and I bet you did), the story is perhaps inspired by Henry James's novella ""Turn of the Screw,"" which deals with the similar situation.  You may as well read that equally well-crafted, creepy story.Trivia: look closely at one of the old photoes of the dead: one of the three men on the bed is director Amenabar himself  (and one of the others is Mateo Gil, director of Spanish film ""Nadie conoce a nadie"" of which music Amenabar composed, and of which star Eduardo Noriega was featured in the two previous Amenabar film in Spain, ""Thesis"" and ""Open Your Eyes.""  The former one is a must-see for anyone loving blood-curdling thriller.  But hey, appearing in a photo?  This is exactly what Hitchcock did in one of his earlier films about a life-boat, another masterpiece about the people in a confined place !!  Surely Amenabar loves his master.",5,Fear Comes From Inside: Really Scary Film with Stylish Touch,1019952000,"04 28, 2002",2002,3305,"['Yesterday', 'April', '28', 'have', 'finally', 'seen', 'theatrical', 'release', 'masterpiece', 'Japan', 'waiting', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'long', 'was', 'worth', 'patience', 'Others', 'not', 'only', 'chilling', 'scary', 'movie', 'crafted', 'style', 'intelligence', 'fantastic', 'watch', 'director', 'who', 'still', 'age', '30', 'create', 'piece', 'art.As', 'probably', 'have', 'known', 'now', 'beautiful', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Grace', 'children', 'are', 'allergic', 'light', 'disaease', 'really', 'should', 'know', 'ritual-like', 'meticulous', 'rules', 'household', 'works', 'employing', 'new', 'servants', 'huge', 'dreary', 'countryhouse', 'ever-hanging', 'fogs', 'mystriously', 'surround', 'are', 'know', 'intruder', 's', 'here', 'existence', 'children', 'are', 'convinced', 'sooner', 'later', 'Grace', 'feel', 'natural', 'unfair', 'comparison', 'point', 'out', 'Others', 'places', 'certain', 'Oscar-nominated', 'film', 'director', 'Amenabar', 'completely', 'different', 'touch', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'much', 'let', 'say', 'Hitchcock', 'classic', 'Rebecca', 'heroine', 'audience', 'lured', 'inexplicably', 'mystery', 'old', 'house', 'past', 'Also', 'using', 'classic', 'frameworks', 'ghost', 'stories', 'used', 'original', 'Haunting', 'Robert', 'Wise', 'version', 'NOT', 'THAT', 'remake', 'film', 'jumping', 'seats', 'sending', 'lots', 'chill', 'spine', 'moreover', 'universal', 'subject', 'love', 'mother', 'children', 'subtle', 'fashion', 'top', 'film', 'further', 'make', 'mother', 'Grace', 'not', 'exactly', 'ideal', 'one', 'kids', 'eventually', 'depicting', 'fraility', 'humans', 'short', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'think', 'know.Anchored', 'strong', 'believable', 'acting', 'given', 'underrated', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'why', 'did', 'Oscar', 'ignore', 'work', 'here', 'preferring', 'musical', 'well', 'right', 'understand', 'aided', 'effectively', 'other', 'well-cast', 'players', 'uncanny', 'presence', 'unnerve', 'greatly', 'Others', 'will', 'rivet', 'eyes', 'screen', 'especially', 'when', 'are', 'connoisseur', 'old-fashioned', 'horror', 'film', 'Keep', 'eyes', 'open', 'when', 'see', 'details', 'film', 'furniture', 'photoes', 'everything', 'Something', 'wrong', 'house', 'how', 'what', 'not', 'clear', 'bizzare', 'sensation', 'asset', 'film', 'will', 'find', 'what', 'missed', 'repeated', 'viewing.For', 'who', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'bet', 'did', 'story', 'perhaps', 'inspired', 'Henry', 'James', 'novella', 'Turn', 'Screw', 'similar', 'situation', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'read', 'equally', 'well-crafted', 'creepy', 'story.Trivia', 'look', 'closely', 'one', 'old', 'photoes', 'dead', 'one', 'three', 'men', 'bed', 'director', 'Amenabar', 'one', 'others', 'Mateo', 'Gil', 'director', 'Spanish', 'film', 'Nadie', 'nadie', 'music', 'Amenabar', 'composed', 'star', 'Eduardo', 'Noriega', 'was', 'featured', 'two', 'previous', 'Amenabar', 'film', 'Spain', 'Thesis', 'Open', 'Eyes', 'former', 'one', 'must-see', 'anyone', 'loving', 'blood-curdling', 'thriller', 'hey', 'appearing', 'photo', 'exactly', 'what', 'Hitchcock', 'did', 'one', 'earlier', 'films', 'life-boat', 'masterpiece', 'people', 'confined', 'place', 'Surely', 'Amenabar', 'master']",The Others

The sets, scenery, sound, lighting, costumes, and effects all add to the eery mood and tone of the film. The film gives just enough information, while keeping enough information hidden to keep the audience guessing to what is going on.The movie is in many ways like THE SIXTH SENSE. However, THE OTHERS is different from that movie in one major aspect. THE OTHERS makes a point to question the improbability of the Christian faith. This aspect of the film is overlooked by many, but it is there. The one thing that Grace has to comfort her after her husband and servants leave is her faith. She constantly refers to it throughout the film. The film's ending causes not just Grace, but everyone to question what they believe. There is nothing wrong with the questioning, but THE OTHERS does not present anything else as an alternative to what Grace believes.

544771,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00003CYLJ,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[0, 0]","With references to Hammer horror films and The Innocents (one of the best suspense thrillers of its type and a great ghost story as well based on Henry James' Turn of the Screw), The Others is the type of film America has forgotten how to make. It's intelligent, well acted with interesting twists and turns in its plot. I suspose The Others has as much to do with gothic thrillers as it does with more horror films.Anyone expecting a jump out of your seat, blunt witless horror film should look elsewhere. Yes, the director does linger a bit too long on his mystery and it does take a bit too long to reach its climax but, on the whole, the film is a rewarding bit of entertainment. The performances are top notch and, again, the acting references the melodramatic style of Peter Cushing or  period dramas from the 40's and 50's. Kidman in fact is a perfect female counterpart to Cushing. Cushing's edgy, almost over the top performances were a highlight of even the weakest Hammer film. Here Kidman's acting choices seem inspired by both Cushing and the stable of Hammer actors from the 50's (including the underrated Michael Gough and Christopher Lee).It's not The Matrix nor does it pretend to be. This fine film is a throw back to an older film tradition where a director actually expected intelligence from his audience. Approach The Others with an open mind. It's rather ironic, because I read a review posted at amazon that claimed Alien was a lame horror film. Remember, that horror is showing the audience but suspense is withholding until the very last minute. The later takes more skill. Hitchcock was a master of suspense (much like Ridley Scott is at his best).

Hancock,"[1, 2]","I come to this ghost story from two perspectives; on one hand I am a movie lover, and a spooky movie lover in particular, and, from that perspective I have to say that this is a real nifty piece of work. It is so refreshing to see something so free of guts, gore, and barbarism. There are no &quot;Hellraisers&quot; here, no Freddy Krueger, no Jason Vorhees, and no Michael Myers. No FX sequences included simply to shock and revulse and &quot;push the envelope of edginess&quot; (buzzwords schlock producers use to rationalize their sick &quot;tastes&quot; as being &quot;artistic vision&quot;. Go figure).  This movie has characters, relationships, situations,and a STORY to tell. And it does a stylishly grand job of doing so. There is tension, puzzlement, mystery, and unease throughout it...and it all works. And the solution to the mystery of the &quot;otherness&quot; of &quot;The Others&quot; is a stunner. A plot device that truly turns the viewers' perception of who is who and what is what on its head.Marvelous movie. Well mounted. Well acted. Well told....and a bit more than that. A very ACCURATE sort of movie. The screenwriters here have really done their &quot;homework&quot;, so to speak. I said earlier that I came at this film from two perspectives, only one of them being as a film fan. The other perspective is as an off-and-on ghost hunter (yes, tri-field meters, laser thermographic guns, etc.,etc.). And from that perspective I must note that this movie runs VERY close to the truth re: my own observations on the &quot;thought processes&quot; of &quot;ghosts&quot;: which is, that VERY few of the &quot;real things&quot; believe FOR A MINUTE that they ARE ghosts, or that they are even DEAD. And they regard YOU as a real nut case if you try to convince them OTHERWISE. They DON'T want to HEAR it. So, without trying to spill too much of the storyline of this movie to those who have never seen it, I will only say this; there is a lot more paranormal VALIDITY here than there is pure hokum dreamed up in the off-kilter mind of a paid screenwriter.Watch &quot;The Others&quot;.

Many of these relate to the story to follow, and form an odd mix of the nostalgic &amp; the disturbing.  After this leisurely but unnerving start, complete with a harpsichord playing softly insinuating notes in the background of the soundtrack, we see a mansion shrouded in fog and see the caption for &quot;[Isle of] Jersey, 1945.&quot;Nicole Kidman, as Grace, soon appears on the screen: she's a lovely,but somewhat birdlike creature: pale alabaster face, wide eyes, many nervous mannerisms.  She soon admits three of the other main characters who arrive at the front door, a trio of mysterious servants-for-hire, Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flannagan), Mr. Tuttle, and the mute Lydia.  They have come calling about the positions advertised.  Grace informs them that the other servants left suddenly,&quot;for no reason.&quot;  She then takes the new servants on an odd tour of the lower rooms of the mansion--as she locks each door in sequence after leaving every room.  Now, with some reserve, Grace informs them that she would like for them to meet her children, Anne and Nicholas. Her husband, Charles, left to fight in the Second World War, and has yet to return to them. The children, Grace informs Mrs. Mills, suffer from a rare skin ailment that could make exposure to sunlight potentially fatal, so an elaborate ritual of drawing all curtains must take place.  At last, we meet the two children, who seem rather demure and cowed by their mother's domineering nature.As the movie progresses, we learn that Grace has a deep,abiding Catholic faith that causes her to dislike &quot;fancies&quot; of her children--especially talk of seemingly imaginary friends. Anne insists that a young boy, named Victor, lives in the house along with his family, that he pulls the window curtains aside in her and Nicholas's room in the dead of night.  Such talk infuriates Grace: she finds such notions bordering on blasphemy, the idea that the dead should walk before the Day of Judgment.  The claustrophobia of her rigid reactions engulfs the mood of the increasingly tense family.But, then more odd events occur: whispering voices,a genuinely startling sequence with a piano playing a sad tune to itself in the darkened conservatory, doors opening and slamming for no apparent reason.  In a disused room, Grace finds a hidden album, bound in black with gold clasps sealing it.  What a peculiar Victorian artifact! As Mrs. Mills explains, the custom 50 years past was to compile books of photographs of the newly dead, as a momento mori.  These belonged to a family that had lived there during the 1890's.  With a repulsed reaction, Grace instructs her to destroy it.Before long, Grace finds herself consulting with young Anne as to who the &quot;intruders&quot; are, and the nervous girl sketches Victor, his mother, his father, and a rather sinister eyeless &quot;old woman,&quot; who has manifested herself to the younggirl some 14 times.Grace decides to strike out to &quot;the village&quot; nearby to consult with the local parish priest, but a cloying fog seals her off in the forest nearby.  A figure approaches in the gloom, and, as it approaches, we find it revealed to be...I won't spoil the final surprises (and they are myriad) that the remaining plot of this movie brings.  I refuse to be so boorish, as I hope that many of you reading my words will consider spending an afternoon or an evening visiting that isolated mansion that always seems to have a pall of fog about it, where doors slam of their own accord, and shrill cries echo in the night.  Although one may fairly invoke &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; when discussing the film, I found myself more reminded of Robert Aickman for some reason, perhaps the spare elegance of the film appeared to invoke his prose, but also of a certain celebrated tale by a famous American horror writer &amp; cynic of the 19th century.  I fear I will allow a spectral cat out of its bag should I say more at this moment.For this film possesses a marvelous &quot;twist ending,&quot; and, while, in the final analysis, it presents a type of shaggy-dog story, I think you'll enjoy a thrilling ride along the way.",5,M.R.

I am frankly astounded by her incredible talent - she is a goddess in Moulin Rouge, which, if you haven't seen, you must - and here, she shines even brighter in a completely different story.  Tenuous and daring, this movie takes ghost stories in a new light.  The ending was completely and shockingly unexpected, and I usually can tell when something is about to happen.

The end was SO intense!The screaming and yelling at the old women with the blank, white eyes just sitting there with the rest of her dead family at the table asking the same question over and over while she was staring strait into nothing and scribling nothing on white paper, The scary musical score is bairing!!!!!

Maybe like The Lady in White, Jamica Inn. You dont have to sit thru rude and vulgar dialog, no sex scene's, just an out and out good, haunting mystery. Nicole Kidman did an outstanding job as the mother of two children,Ann,and Nicholas. They have a rare condition and cannot be in the sunlight. The heavy curtains are drawn, and Nicole must lock all doors behind her so that the children will not go into the room with sunlight, by mistake. This is not a BOO, I scared you type movie, but, rather, a haunting, deeply personal film. The plot is very good and if the camera leaves you alone for a moment the musical score grabs you and you really dont have time to jump ahead and try and figure it out. You have to wait for the movie to unfold, it gives u nothing in advance.

With that simple phrase uttered in ""The Others"", perhaps the greatest horror/thriller in cinema history commences.For a basic plot summary, ""The Others"" sees Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) and her two photo-sensitive (can't be exposed to any natural light) children living in an old mansion in post-WW2 Europe.  While waiting for the father of the house to return from war, the house and family are suddenly intruded-upon by seemingly otherworldly inhabitants, who have the ability to come and go as they please, sight unseen.I wish I could say so much more about this incredible film, but doing so would likely ruin the overall experience.  As such, I'll just say this: The only other films in this genre that even challenge this on are ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""What Lies Beneath"".  Not too shabby of company, for sure.Also, please--whatever you do!--do not pass this movie by because it is advertised as a ""ghost story"".  It is more truly a psychological thriller with a paranormal element.Overall, ""The Others"" is on my ""short list"" of greatest films of all-time.

544783,A1TOML01ZYPUFR,B00003CYLJ,"Zachary S. Houp ""RAREfiend""","[3, 3]","The Others is one of those olds-school horror films that shines beyond the modern superficiality of the genre, and that is pretty much all critics have had to say for it.  It does indeed scare--exactly what it is intended to do--without glitzy special effects and over-the-top ghosts.  It is instead, so exceedingly simple, its focus is so intensely minimalist, that many consider the film to be rather slow developing, and comes across long and tedious.  I heartily disagree:  at an hour and forty-five minutes, nothing seems long; and rather than being anything like slow and tedious, it is COMPLETE, perhaps the greatest compliment I can bestow on a film.  The Others tells every story it wants to tell, and it tells it very well; for that reason it succeeds in its intention.Indeed, when you are confined to a mansion with a small, select group of characters, there is not much exploration of outside areas and topics; but this film obviously doesn't need to do that.  Sure the film takes its time, but since it always knows where its going, and it always gets there, the film cannot be criticized for that reason.  And it is all bound together by good efforts on both sides of the camera.  If at the very least, the housekeepers come across as detrimentally eccentric, then at least Nicole Kidman portrays her character superbly.  Without superb actors in the children, the film would have been ruined; fortunately, both the boy and the girl steal every moment they appear on screen.  Moreover, director Amenabar manages to keep the shots diverse, despite the monotony of some of the locations; subtle motion and deliberate pans do a lot to keep the action moving.  Amenabar, playing triple duty on this film, also deserves much credit for his score to The Others, which is haunting to say the least, uncharacteristic for sure, and just memorable enough to follow you from the theatre.  (Note: when humming, the children are always singing the main theme from the film.)And so the finished product to this movie may be too little for some to handle, but those with the patience will discover an elaborate, character-driven film that relies heavily on the feeling of fear rather than its visualization.  Indeed, this movie could have very easily become boring, had not every actor and filmmaker on bored been so completely competent in his or her tasks.  Moreover, it is exceedingly scary.  It's always a delight to hear a theatre audience scream simultaneously, then all share an embarrassed chuckle afterwards.  The Others does this and several times over.  In short, it succeeds effectively as the kind of horror movie that Hollywood likes to neglect;  I hope you won't neglect it too.",4,"Be Patient, and You'll Be Scared!",1013817600,"02 16, 2002",2002,2692,"['Others', 'one', 'olds-school', 'horror', 'films', 'modern', 'superficiality', 'genre', 'pretty', 'much', 'critics', 'have', 'had', 'say', 'indeed', 'scare', 'exactly', 'what', 'intended', 'do', 'glitzy', 'special', 'effects', 'over-the-top', 'ghosts', 'instead', 'so', 'exceedingly', 'simple', 'focus', 'so', 'intensely', 'minimalist', 'many', 'consider', 'film', 'be', 'rather', 'slow', 'developing', 'long', 'tedious', 'heartily', 'disagree', 'hour', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'nothing', 'long', 'rather', 'being', 'anything', 'slow', 'tedious', 'COMPLETE', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'compliment', 'can', 'bestow', 'film', 'Others', 'tells', 'story', 'tell', 'very', 'well', 'reason', 'intention.Indeed', 'when', 'are', 'confined', 'mansion', 'small', 'select', 'group', 'characters', 'not', 'much', 'exploration', 'outside', 'areas', 'topics', 'film', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'need', 'do', 'Sure', 'film', 'time', 'always', 'where', 'going', 'always', 'there', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'criticized', 'reason', 'together', 'good', 'efforts', 'sides', 'camera', 'very', 'least', 'housekeepers', 'come', 'detrimentally', 'eccentric', 'then', 'least', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'character', 'superbly', 'superb', 'actors', 'children', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'ruined', 'fortunately', 'boy', 'girl', 'steal', 'moment', 'appear', 'screen', 'Moreover', 'director', 'Amenabar', 'keep', 'shots', 'diverse', 'monotony', 'locations', 'subtle', 'motion', 'deliberate', 'pans', 'do', 'lot', 'keep', 'action', 'moving', 'Amenabar', 'playing', 'triple', 'duty', 'film', 'also', 'much', 'credit', 'score', 'Others', 'haunting', 'say', 'least', 'uncharacteristic', 'sure', 'just', 'memorable', 'enough', 'follow', 'theatre', 'Note', 'when', 'humming', 'children', 'are', 'always', 'singing', 'main', 'theme', 'film', 'so', 'finished', 'product', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'little', 'handle', 'patience', 'will', 'discover', 'elaborate', 'character-driven', 'film', 'heavily', 'feeling', 'fear', 'rather', 'visualization', 'Indeed', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'very', 'easily', 'become', 'boring', 'had', 'not', 'actor', 'filmmaker', 'bored', 'been', 'so', 'completely', 'competent', 'tasks', 'Moreover', 'exceedingly', 'scary', 'always', 'delight', 'hear', 'theatre', 'audience', 'scream', 'simultaneously', 'then', 'share', 'embarrassed', 'chuckle', 'afterwards', 'Others', 'several', 'times', 'over', 'short', 'effectively', 'kind', 'horror', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'neglect', 'hope', 'wo', ""n't"", 'neglect', 'too']",The Others
