908349,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B0009ML2UG,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[297, 301]","So few films have been made about the dance world, and this one captures the heart of it, with the insane hours of hard work, the sweat, and the frayed egos. The plot of ""One Last Dance"" is based on ""Without a Word,"" a play Patrick Swayze and his wife Lisa Neimi created many years ago. It is a wisp of a story, mostly about the emotions and conflicts of 3 dancers who are past their performance peak, returning to the stage for a benefit gala, to face their fears and the relationships they left behind.Writer/director/actress and dancer Neimi, who has an inner and outer beauty so lovely to watch, has put ""One Last Dance"" together on a shoestring budget, with tremendous skill and a marvelous cast. The company dancers are superb, with a technical virtuosity in many styles, from traditional to the most contemporary. George de la Pena plays Max Delano, one of the 3 leads, and will be remembered from his days with the American Ballet Theater and on Broadway, and is dynamic both as a dancer and an actor. Other standouts include Matthew Walker as Alex McGrath, a sadistic choreographer, and Stefan Wenta as Orest, a poetic teacher who is an inspiration to all. Patrick Swayze as Travis is a marvel, with the athleticism and energy of someone half his age.The wonderful score is by Stacy Widelitz, with non-original music that ranges from Beethoven's 7th Symphony, to a cameo by Daniel Heifetz (grandson of the legendary Jascha Heifetz) as a street violinist. The cinematography by Albert Dunk is terrific on the dance sequences, which sometimes have a touch of surrealism using smoke and other effects, and there are some magnificent overhead crane shots. Dance is not an easy thing to film, and in ""One Last Dance"" we have scenes that are spectacular. The interesting and sometimes inspired choreography is by Alonzo King, Dwight Rhoden, Doug Varone, and Patsy Swayze (Patrick's mother).As someone who spent 2 decades of my life immersed in the world of dance, I appreciate the authenticity of this film, and the excellence of its performers. It is sure to become a film classic for dancers and those who love to watch them. DVD extras include a ""behind the scenes"" piece, and commentary by Patrick and Lisa.

908350,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B0009ML2UG,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[12, 18]","""One Last Dance"" is a Swayze family affair (to quote Mystery Science Theater 3000 ""have a Patrick Swayze Christmas!""),complete with Swayze's real-life wife Lisa Niemi,choreography from his mother Patsy,and his daughter Bambi part of the corps de ballet. ""One Last Dance"" sounds like a sappy clunker,but in some ways it's surprisingly good.The two major strengths of ""One Last Dance"" are its music and choreography. The soundtrack is incredibly bittersweet and melancholy,a true tearjerker even when the dialogue is maudlin. The dancers are incredibly talented. It's more of a music video than a movie with its focus on the human body in motion. Both classical music as well as a Brazilian dance song highlight the dancers' strengths.Unfortunately,""One Last Dance"" is burdened with a hopelessly sappy plot. Travis (Swayze),Chryssa (Niemi) and Max (George De La Pena) are reunited for a tribute dance concert. Travis finds out he has a long-lost daughter,a child he never knew he fathered. Max struggles with his talents. Chryssa is dealing with her reunion with her former lover. Everything is melodramatically resolved;there aren't any unexpected plot twists.Since this is a Patrick Swayze movie,there is a requisite shirtless scene and homoeroticism (Travis gets hit on by the artistic director,and he dances sensually with Max in the final pas de trois)It's not a MST3K-worthy movie like ""Road House"",but it is like a French appetizer called an amuse bouche.The dancing is a delight to watch,and the soundtrack is worth listening to (even when one can shut out the plot-or lack of it)",3,Dirty Middle-Aged Dancing,1188172800,"08 27, 2007",2007,1586,"['One', 'Last', 'Dance', 'Swayze', 'family', 'affair', 'quote', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', '3000', 'have', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'Christmas', 'complete', 'Swayze', 'real-life', 'wife', 'Lisa', 'Niemi', 'choreography', 'mother', 'Patsy', 'daughter', 'Bambi', 'part', 'corps', 'ballet', 'One', 'Last', 'Dance', 'sappy', 'clunker', 'ways', 'surprisingly', 'good.The', 'two', 'major', 'strengths', 'One', 'Last', 'Dance', 'are', 'music', 'choreography', 'soundtrack', 'incredibly', 'bittersweet', 'melancholy', 'true', 'tearjerker', 'even', 'when', 'dialogue', 'maudlin', 'dancers', 'are', 'incredibly', 'talented', 'more', 'music', 'video', 'movie', 'focus', 'human', 'body', 'motion', 'classical', 'music', 'as', 'well', 'Brazilian', 'dance', 'song', 'highlight', 'dancers', 'strengths.Unfortunately', 'One', 'Last', 'Dance', 'burdened', 'hopelessly', 'sappy', 'plot', 'Travis', 'Swayze', 'Chryssa', 'Niemi', 'Max', 'George', 'De', 'La', 'Pena', 'are', 'reunited', 'tribute', 'dance', 'concert', 'Travis', 'out', 'long-lost', 'daughter', 'child', 'never', 'knew', 'fathered', 'Max', 'talents', 'Chryssa', 'dealing', 'reunion', 'former', 'lover', 'Everything', 'melodramatically', 'resolved', 'are', ""n't"", 'unexpected', 'plot', 'twists.Since', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'movie', 'requisite', 'shirtless', 'scene', 'homoeroticism', 'Travis', 'hit', 'artistic', 'director', 'sensually', 'Max', 'final', 'pas', 'trois', 'not', 'MST3K-worthy', 'movie', 'Road', 'House', 'French', 'appetizer', 'called', 'amuse', 'bouche.The', 'dancing', 'delight', 'watch', 'soundtrack', 'worth', 'listening', 'even', 'when', 'one', 'can', 'shut', 'out', 'plot-or', 'lack']",One Last Dance

I purchased this movie solely because he was in it.  :)However, I was VERY pleasantly surprised that there was so much more to this movie!  The storyline was wonderful.  Very little dialog is needed. The story of three dancers returning to the dance world is told through their dancing.It was intriguing to watch the 40 something year olds dance their hearts out, often along side the 20 something year olds. I would love to watch ""The Company"" dance together in person... if that were only possible.  They all meshed together extremely well.Lisa Neimi did a wonderful job.

908352,A1UTIT634AL3KQ,B0009ML2UG,arganon,"[10, 17]","Thank goodness my wife and I rented this movie because it is a one-viewing-only experience. We are introduced to Patrick Swayze's character and he seems the country hayseed who just got off the train from Booniesville. Later, we learn he's been ""all over the world"". Then we have to endure watching Lisa Neimi having, or reliving, her repeated emotional breakdowns. Boo hoo. Oh, don't forget George De La Pena. One minute he's prodding the two former lovers, (Swayze and Neimi), into dancing the production they've all reunited to do. The next he's crying at his makeup table because he never believed he, himself, could complete the darn task. Oh please!!! The story is so full of drama queens it's beyond belief!!! I have to admit that my wife and I spent most of the movie chuckling at the acting, the story and finally the lover's dance sequences. My major complaint was we hardly got to see these ""great dancers"" dance. There were plenty of waist up shots of the pair emoting their polarizing love/hate feelings. Demonstrations of their dance skill? It seemed to be a case of hiding their weaknesses. And, then there's Neimi's fatherless daughter. It wasn't too hard to figure out who's daddy. This plotline is so tired and comes at you thousands of miles before it's revealed. No surprise here.Now let's be real. The threesome, who are supposed to be saving this dance company with their performance, were all pushing their mid 40's when we see the flashbacks of seven years prior!!! Now the movie is trying to convince us that not one, but three people are going to beat the odds, and are expected to perform like the kiddies?!?!? As I said, we had to hold back the giggles.Three things of note should be added here:1. Watch the extra feature on this DVD. Neimi and Swayze, (real life husband and wife), show SO MUCH more of an emotional connection there than they ever could muster for the movie's performance. When not of the wooden variety, their emotional range swung to a stupefying over acting. Again, boo-hoo.2. The movie's lighting director and photographer should have been fired on the spot. Miss Neimi  looks quite ancient and Swayze looks like his face is plastic. During one scene Patrick wants to practice a jump-catch!!! We cringed because it was like telling us our grandma was going to make the same attempt. We were convinced if Lisa fell it would be the preverbal ""old woman"" breaking her hip. Again, refer to the extra features. They look quite pleasant and Neimi looks like she may even be able to pull this wishing well story off.3. Lastly, I would say the sequences with the other dancers gathered for this movie were very good. They were quite entertaining to watch and were performed with inventive choreography. Three cheers for the understudies!!! Hurrah, Hurrah, Hurrah!!!I have mixed emotions about this film. On one hand I like to root for the ""old-timer"" who makes good. On the other, it is tremendously embarrassing watching ""old people"" look foolish. Unfortunately my rooting turned to laughing in disbelief. Rent, don't buy, this movie as ironic camp and for the intermittent supporting dancers' sequences.",2,I give it 2 stars for it's unintended comedy.,1157932800,"09 11, 2006",2006,3147,"['Thank', 'goodness', 'wife', 'rented', 'movie', 'one-viewing-only', 'experience', 'are', 'introduced', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'character', 'country', 'hayseed', 'who', 'just', 'got', 'off', 'train', 'Booniesville', 'Later', 'learn', 'been', 'world', 'Then', 'have', 'endure', 'watching', 'Lisa', 'Neimi', 'having', 'reliving', 'repeated', 'emotional', 'breakdowns', 'Boo', 'hoo', 'Oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'George', 'De', 'La', 'Pena', 'One', 'minute', 'prodding', 'two', 'former', 'lovers', 'Swayze', 'Neimi', 'dancing', 'production', ""'ve"", 'reunited', 'do', 'next', 'crying', 'makeup', 'table', 'never', 'believed', 'could', 'complete', 'darn', 'task', 'Oh', 'please', 'story', 'so', 'full', 'drama', 'belief', 'have', 'admit', 'wife', 'spent', 'most', 'movie', 'chuckling', 'acting', 'story', 'finally', 'lover', 'dance', 'sequences', 'major', 'complaint', 'was', 'hardly', 'got', 'see', 'great', 'dancers', 'dance', 'were', 'plenty', 'waist', 'shots', 'pair', 'emoting', 'polarizing', 'love/hate', 'feelings', 'Demonstrations', 'dance', 'skill', 'seemed', 'be', 'case', 'hiding', 'weaknesses', 'then', 'Neimi', 'fatherless', 'daughter', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'daddy', 'plotline', 'so', 'tired', 'thousands', 'miles', 'revealed', 'surprise', 'be', 'real', 'threesome', 'who', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'saving', 'dance', 'company', 'performance', 'were', 'pushing', 'mid', '40', 'when', 'see', 'flashbacks', 'seven', 'years', 'prior', 'Now', 'movie', 'trying', 'convince', 'not', 'one', 'three', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'beat', 'odds', 'are', 'expected', 'perform', 'kiddies', 'said', 'had', 'hold', 'back', 'giggles.Three', 'things', 'note', 'should', 'be', 'added', 'here:1', 'Watch', 'extra', 'feature', 'DVD', 'Neimi', 'Swayze', 'real', 'life', 'husband', 'wife', 'show', 'SO', 'MUCH', 'more', 'emotional', 'connection', 'there', 'ever', 'could', 'muster', 'movie', 'performance', 'When', 'not', 'wooden', 'variety', 'emotional', 'range', 'swung', 'stupefying', 'acting', 'Again', 'boo-hoo.2', 'movie', 'lighting', 'director', 'photographer', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'fired', 'spot', 'Miss', 'Neimi', 'quite', 'ancient', 'Swayze', 'face', 'plastic', 'one', 'scene', 'Patrick', 'practice', 'jump-catch', 'cringed', 'was', 'telling', 'grandma', 'was', 'going', 'make', 'same', 'attempt', 'were', 'convinced', 'Lisa', 'fell', 'would', 'be', 'preverbal', 'old', 'woman', 'breaking', 'hip', 'Again', 'refer', 'extra', 'features', 'look', 'quite', 'pleasant', 'Neimi', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'able', 'pull', 'wishing', 'well', 'story', 'off.3', 'Lastly', 'would', 'say', 'sequences', 'other', 'dancers', 'gathered', 'movie', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'were', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'were', 'performed', 'inventive', 'choreography', 'Three', 'cheers', 'understudies', 'Hurrah', 'Hurrah', 'Hurrah', 'have', 'mixed', 'emotions', 'film', 'one', 'hand', 'like', 'root', 'old-timer', 'who', 'good', 'other', 'tremendously', 'embarrassing', 'watching', 'old', 'people', 'look', 'foolish', 'Unfortunately', 'rooting', 'turned', 'laughing', 'disbelief', 'Rent', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'movie', 'ironic', 'camp', 'intermittent', 'supporting', 'dancers', 'sequences']",One Last Dance

There is some terrific Brazilian influenced music from Stacy Widelitz that enhances much of the corps dancing and some beautiful moments of cinematography making the most of a bare ballet studio rehearsal hall - both of which add what dreaminess this low budget film has to offer.Written and directed and produced and acted by Lisa Niemi the story involves the return to the boards by three retired dancers (Lisa Niemi, Patrick Swayze, George de la Pena - all three are dancers in real life) to pay homage to the gifts of a highly regarded yet now dead choreographer.  The three left dancing seven years prior to the story for personal reasons, mostly involving lack of confidence and personal issues that affected  each tangentially.  They return to a company to perform a dance by the dead choreographer and the rest of the slim story is how these out of shape hoofers regain the healing magic of dancing.The corps of ballet dancers assembled for this film is exceptionally fine for a pickup group: Rasta Thomas, Desmond Richardson, Kathryn Bradney, Tai Jiminez, Bambi Swayze, Jamie Bishton, Stephanie Slater, Heather Thompson, Dwight Rhoden and  Yosuke Mino deserve special mention.  The scenes of dancing vary depending on the choreography of each of four artists - Alonzo King, Dwight Rhoden, Patsy Swayze, and Doug Varone.  But in the end to be less than a documentary about the rigors and rewards of dancing there must be a well-acted story based on a sensitive script and that is where the film is shaky and a bit self indulgent.  Swayze, Niemi, de la Pena take the roles as far as they go, but in the end the story is much ado about very little.Yet there is some gorgeous dance work well filmed that will satisfy even the most particular critic.  The DVD  added features include some insights into the difficulty and final rewards of bringing ONE LAST DANCE to the screen, and in these comments there is more story than that found in the script.

It's pretty obvious from the get-go that Travis and Chrissa are soul mates destined to reconnect after seven years of separation and misunderstandings.  When Alex, the emotionally abusive director of a New York Dance Company, goes too far with his criticisms (this is the point where I'd like to introduce people of Alex's bent to the wonders of Dale Carnegie in helpfully motivating people), three dancers' lives are redirected.  Chrissa has a nervous breakdown (we later learn that she was newly pregnant during this scene, so horomones and stress contributed to her break) while Travis (injured from overexertion) can do little to comfort her besides telling off Alex.  Max, the other member of the pas de trois, carries off a sobbing and temporarily deranged Chrissa to the nearest mental health hospital. (The three dancers were days away from premiering a pas de trois dance before this misfortune interrupts them.) Travis wrongfully assumes that Chrissa hasn't contacted him because she wants her space and wants him out of her life (he doesn't realize she had been hospitalized).  Chrissa, meanwhile, is hurt that Travis hasn't inquired after her and therefore, keeps her pregnancy a secret from him.  Max is the middle man, and seven years later, he is instrumental in reconnecting the estranged lovers when the struggling company decides to resurrect the Pas de Trois.Yes, the plot is the stuff of soap operas, but it has heart, and the real-life love between Patrick Swayze (Travis) and his wife, Lisa Niemi (Chrissa), is palpable on-screen. Also, I can always empathize with someone who is experiencing a breakdown of sorts (read my Fred Luskin's ""Forgive for Good"" and Sylvia Plath's ""The Bell Jar"" reviews for an insider's perspective on what an awful experience this is). In addition, I appreciate this movie's undercurrent theme: move beyond the negative voices we've picked up through the years.Swayze and Niemi are no longer twentysomethings, yet they hold their own in this physically demanding art form.  They dance beautifully.In the behind-the-scenes special feature, Swayze said that this production hired four choreographers to represent the latest happenings in the dance world.  I loved the choreography and the dancing--it was breathtaking and innovative. I was thrilled to see some of the very same dancers in this movie who have graced the covers of Dance and Pointe magazines. The dancers said that they felt like they really were members of the movie's dance company and that there was a spirit of collaboration and non-competitiveness as well as a suspension of ego during filming. One dancer said that he and the other dancers could easily and happily tour the movie's original dances to (he confidentally believed) great acclaim.",4,A labor of love,1164326400,"11 24, 2006",2006,2944,"['movie', 'not', 'flaws', 'dialogue', 'acting', 'occasionally', 'seem', 'flat', 'recycled', 'storylines', 'melodrama', 'etc.', 'yet', 'am', 'sucker', 'dance', 'movies', 'loved', 'nonetheless', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'get-go', 'Travis', 'Chrissa', 'are', 'soul', 'mates', 'destined', 'reconnect', 'seven', 'years', 'separation', 'misunderstandings', 'When', 'Alex', 'emotionally', 'abusive', 'director', 'New', 'York', 'Dance', 'Company', 'too', 'far', 'criticisms', 'point', 'where', ""'d"", 'like', 'introduce', 'people', 'Alex', 'bent', 'wonders', 'Dale', 'Carnegie', 'helpfully', 'motivating', 'people', 'three', 'dancers', 'lives', 'are', 'redirected', 'Chrissa', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'later', 'learn', 'was', 'newly', 'pregnant', 'scene', 'horomones', 'stress', 'contributed', 'break', 'Travis', 'injured', 'overexertion', 'can', 'do', 'little', 'comfort', 'besides', 'telling', 'off', 'Alex', 'Max', 'other', 'member', 'pas', 'trois', 'sobbing', 'temporarily', 'deranged', 'Chrissa', 'nearest', 'mental', 'health', 'hospital', 'three', 'dancers', 'were', 'days', 'away', 'premiering', 'pas', 'trois', 'dance', 'misfortune', 'Travis', 'wrongfully', 'Chrissa', ""n't"", 'contacted', 'space', 'life', ""n't"", 'realize', 'had', 'been', 'hospitalized', 'Chrissa', 'meanwhile', 'hurt', 'Travis', ""n't"", 'inquired', 'therefore', 'pregnancy', 'secret', 'Max', 'middle', 'man', 'seven', 'years', 'later', 'instrumental', 'reconnecting', 'estranged', 'lovers', 'when', 'struggling', 'company', 'resurrect', 'Pas', 'de', 'Trois.Yes', 'plot', 'stuff', 'soap', 'operas', 'heart', 'real-life', 'love', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'Travis', 'wife', 'Lisa', 'Niemi', 'Chrissa', 'palpable', 'on-screen', 'Also', 'can', 'always', 'empathize', 'someone', 'who', 'experiencing', 'breakdown', 'sorts', 'read', 'Fred', 'Luskin', 'Forgive', 'Good', 'Sylvia', 'Plath', 'Bell', 'Jar', 'reviews', 'insider', 'perspective', 'what', 'awful', 'experience', 'addition', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'undercurrent', 'theme', 'move', 'negative', 'voices', ""'ve"", 'picked', 'up', 'years.Swayze', 'Niemi', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'twentysomethings', 'yet', 'hold', 'own', 'physically', 'demanding', 'art', 'form', 'dance', 'behind-the-scenes', 'special', 'feature', 'Swayze', 'said', 'production', 'hired', 'four', 'choreographers', 'represent', 'latest', 'happenings', 'dance', 'world', 'loved', 'choreography', 'dancing', 'was', 'breathtaking', 'innovative', 'was', 'thrilled', 'see', 'very', 'same', 'dancers', 'movie', 'who', 'have', 'graced', 'covers', 'Dance', 'Pointe', 'magazines', 'dancers', 'said', 'felt', 'really', 'were', 'members', 'movie', 'dance', 'company', 'was', 'spirit', 'collaboration', 'non-competitiveness', 'as', 'well', 'suspension', 'ego', 'filming', 'One', 'dancer', 'said', 'other', 'dancers', 'could', 'easily', 'happily', 'tour', 'movie', 'original', 'dances', 'confidentally', 'believed', 'great', 'acclaim']",One Last Dance
