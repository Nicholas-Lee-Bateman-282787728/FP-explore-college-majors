While the format may be familiar, this movie has a unusual twist.  It's about a Native American lacrosse team overcoming coaching and motivational problems to understand the real heritage of the sport.Lacrosse was invented by Native Americans hundreds of years ago.  Now it has been usurped by white kids going to elitist prep schools. Natural &#34;bad guys&#34; for the films.Pretty well acted, great sport scenes, and an interesting story.",4,Interesting and entertaining.,1392163200,"02 12, 2014",2014,555,"['pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'typical', 'story', 'underdog', 'sports', 'team', 'overcoming', 'problems', 'winning', 'end', 'format', 'may', 'be', 'familiar', 'movie', 'unusual', 'twist', 'Native', 'American', 'lacrosse', 'team', 'overcoming', 'coaching', 'motivational', 'problems', 'understand', 'real', 'heritage', 'sport.Lacrosse', 'was', 'invented', 'Native', 'Americans', 'hundreds', 'years', 'ago', 'Now', 'been', 'usurped', 'white', 'kids', 'going', 'elitist', 'prep', 'schools', 'Natural', '34', 'bad', 'guys', '34', 'films.Pretty', 'well', 'acted', 'great', 'sport', 'scenes', 'interesting', 'story']",N/A

1578674,A5UQAS0EYI85G,B008YAPPXK,cheesefilms,"[1, 2]","I enjoyed this film, but I looked more for something that was missing in the area of indigenous culture about this sport. What is interesting and worth the time was the special features documentary short about the Onondaga peoples and lacrosse. To connect this short with the opening runners through the forest in the film would have been, in my mind, a greater success, but the attempt to connect one mans story with his rich culture and background just falls too short and shallow as the action scenes on the playing field are confined to the latter half of the movie. A former lacrosse star, self disgraced (Brandon Routh) from the Onondaga tribal reservation is running the casino complete with skimpy dressed non-native females and feathered headband, brings all the looney tune stereotypes to surface as mixed bloods are whats left of this culture as the full blooded native representation remains the minority in Gil Birmingham as Ben Logan, the father. Everyone from the main character (Routh), his daughter, the Yoda-like and all wise elderly matriarch, the medicine man and half the team, are mixed bloods portaying, to some success, an ancient sport ""for the creator"".Why such a racial lens? Because films about native peoples have been historically geared to represent native culture through Anglo and non-native actors, directors, writers, producers and for non-native audiences appeal. Possibly sacrilege, feathers are not supposed to touch the ground or floor and most tribes do not hand out feathers that equate a school childs gold star for achievement. A handy bald eagle cameo does little to convince such spiritual powers This reminds me of the unending scream you always hear of an eagle or hawk in every film or western about native people from Gunsmoke to I predict, the upcoming ""Lone Ranger"" film with Johnny Depp. Also, by the films own admission, the lone white player on the team catches so much crap, why does he have to be the ""inept"" one of the team? How is this not racially targeting him? Add to this fact that the only person(s) speaking the language is the white school teacher. Even the elderly woman, the tribal council and the medicine man do not speak enough indiginous tongue to show the audience they are, in fact, native peoples. The film's director Steve Rash proves great technical aspects such as cinematography and richness of the color on this eastern native reserve, especially as the film guides towards the ending. Yet, what builds up and takes place during the acting, storyline and even the ethnic grasp of native life just proves too plastic and predictable.The complete tribe showing up at the end of the game makes this film, in my mind, the perfect ""cheesy"" drama and I just didn't feel it.",3,"Great sport, but too predictable!",1351641600,"10 31, 2012",2012,2746,"['enjoyed', 'film', 'looked', 'more', 'something', 'was', 'missing', 'area', 'indigenous', 'culture', 'sport', 'What', 'interesting', 'time', 'was', 'special', 'features', 'documentary', 'short', 'Onondaga', 'peoples', 'lacrosse', 'connect', 'short', 'opening', 'runners', 'forest', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'mind', 'greater', 'success', 'attempt', 'connect', 'one', 'mans', 'story', 'rich', 'culture', 'background', 'just', 'too', 'short', 'shallow', 'action', 'scenes', 'playing', 'field', 'are', 'confined', 'latter', 'half', 'movie', 'former', 'lacrosse', 'star', 'self', 'disgraced', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'Onondaga', 'tribal', 'reservation', 'running', 'casino', 'complete', 'skimpy', 'dressed', 'non-native', 'females', 'feathered', 'headband', 'looney', 'tune', 'stereotypes', 'surface', 'mixed', 'bloods', 'are', 'whats', 'left', 'culture', 'full', 'blooded', 'native', 'representation', 'minority', 'Gil', 'Birmingham', 'Ben', 'Logan', 'father', 'Everyone', 'main', 'character', 'Routh', 'daughter', 'Yoda-like', 'wise', 'elderly', 'matriarch', 'medicine', 'man', 'team', 'are', 'mixed', 'bloods', 'portaying', 'success', 'ancient', 'sport', 'creator', '.Why', 'racial', 'lens', 'films', 'native', 'peoples', 'have', 'been', 'historically', 'geared', 'represent', 'native', 'culture', 'Anglo', 'non-native', 'actors', 'directors', 'writers', 'producers', 'non-native', 'audiences', 'appeal', 'Possibly', 'sacrilege', 'feathers', 'are', 'not', 'supposed', 'touch', 'ground', 'floor', 'most', 'tribes', 'do', 'not', 'hand', 'out', 'feathers', 'equate', 'school', 'childs', 'gold', 'star', 'achievement', 'handy', 'bald', 'eagle', 'cameo', 'little', 'convince', 'such', 'spiritual', 'powers', 'unending', 'scream', 'always', 'hear', 'eagle', 'hawk', 'film', 'western', 'native', 'people', 'Gunsmoke', 'predict', 'upcoming', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'film', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Also', 'films', 'own', 'admission', 'lone', 'white', 'player', 'team', 'so', 'much', 'crap', 'why', 'have', 'be', 'inept', 'one', 'team', 'How', 'not', 'racially', 'targeting', 'Add', 'fact', 'only', 'person', 's', 'speaking', 'language', 'white', 'school', 'teacher', 'Even', 'elderly', 'woman', 'tribal', 'council', 'medicine', 'man', 'do', 'not', 'speak', 'enough', 'indiginous', 'tongue', 'show', 'audience', 'are', 'fact', 'native', 'peoples', 'film', 'director', 'Steve', 'Rash', 'great', 'technical', 'aspects', 'such', 'cinematography', 'richness', 'color', 'eastern', 'native', 'reserve', 'especially', 'film', 'guides', 'ending', 'what', 'up', 'place', 'acting', 'storyline', 'even', 'ethnic', 'grasp', 'native', 'life', 'just', 'too', 'plastic', 'predictable.The', 'complete', 'tribe', 'showing', 'up', 'end', 'game', 'film', 'mind', 'perfect', 'cheesy', 'drama', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel']",N/A

I was pleased and found such substance in the story and the characters as the plot continued into the present day.The main character had become worldly and forgot his heritage,honor to his people and tradition. As the story progresses you see him regain these principles and instill them in the high school lacrosse team he coaches. Crooked Arrows becomes the name of the team and the young men eventually defeat the team which has been on the top for many years. It is through hard work, deciding that the honor of their pride of their Native American heritage,teamwork, and commitment that the team is able to pull through to their victory.The challenge of this team does not go unnoticed by the town and the other Native American people in the surrounding areas as they cheer on the young men in the finals of the lacrosse match. The coach even defeats a developer who tries to take over the land for development.You will delight in the characters and their progress as their relationships become richer throughout the movieThe movie is rated PG, but for your older children, teenagers, especially those in sports, I feel this is a good family movie.

1578684,A32EVG7Y33H4RJ,B008YAPPXK,JazzFeathers,"[5, 5]","The film starts with a fantastic scene of what looks like a pursuit, but you soon learn it's a game. It's the lacrosse game as it was ritually played by Iroquois people in the centuries past to honour the Creator, who gave the game to the people.It drew me right in, and I think this is the difference between this film and so many others about sport and coming of age and finding yourself that you can find out there.Yes, because on the outside, this film is not very different from many others that came before and others that will surely come after this one. We have a mismatched team that always loses. We have a reluctant coach - trapped in the position and with a shady past - that slowly learns to appreciate other people as well as himself. We have a lot of characters funny and less so. I can't honestly say I've never seen anything like this.But I can, and I will say, that the take of this film to this well-known theme is quite unique.The lacrosse itself is a sport that is not often seen on screen. The setting is an Indian reservation (of the fictional nation of Senequois, member of the very real Iroquois Confederacy). And especially the way the theme is played - inside the Iroquois belief that the sport is not merely a game, but it's a way to healing people and places - is something that I don't think I've ever seen in sport films and that I thoroughly enjoyed and found very meaningful.The scenes of actual played game are very good and involving.

I loved playing Lacrosse growing up in Canada, and it was really fantastic to see the historical story and spiritual strength portrayed through the film in it's telling. Lacrosse is more than a sport, it is a sacred dance of the spirit of the player with all that has been created, and ever will be created. Not ""a game"", but a connection to human intention and choice. This cultural cornerstone, how to shape it's principles of self guidance and self cultivation into a story, pleasing to any audience could have been a challenging undertaking for any storyteller - particularly a filmmaker. The filmmakers, actors and players created a shared group experience, which, we the audience get to share with them every step of their journey of deepening connection. Watching the film, I enjoyed every minute, I could sense the joy of each person participating in the film - and knew I was going to be taken somewhere special by the conclusion of the film. The film got better every moment of the viewing, a rare experience in any film. Thank you so much for being inclusive of elders, youth, honouring treaty rights, honouring the land, respecting women, pointing out the soul demeaning aspects of commercial gimmicks which can belittle culture and women ... for the sake of drawing a crowd into a casino. When I think of all the pertinent and timely subjects touched on in the telling of this story, my list grows longer on why everyone should see this film. Aside from the historical, cultural and political reasons to see this film, the film is simply a really fun and enjoyable experience. It is a great gift for anyone. I have already lent it out to several friends who as recent immigrants, can benefit from being touched in their hearts by the sacred history of their new chosen land of residence. The final round dance by the gathering of the nation to support the players is wonderful.

I found this film to be an inspiring tale. Not only is it rich in Native American culture, it also teaches about strong family and community bonds. From the very beginning, as you get to know about the struggling lacrosse team, you learn how the game originated with the Native Americans hundreds of years ago. While it does have the cliche struggling team and come lately coach, the magic of the culture that is interwoven into the film makes it fresh and original. In addition to bringing the team together, this coach must also come to terms with his rich boss who wants to build on the his people's land. Along the way, you watch as he learns what is really important and the final confrontation that takes place at the big game is really inspiring.

A Native American prep school lacrosse team is starting another season. Another very long season. When a change is made in order to restore pride in the people Joe Logan (Routh) is assigned as the new coach. A former All-American player himself (although he hasn't played at all since missing the big shot) the school thinks they have the answer. First of all I will say that this is a good and entertaining movie. That said it took me a little more then halfway through before I realized why I was experiencing Deja-vu. The coach of the down-on-its-luck-rag-tag team used to be the star for the best team in the state. He missed the final shot of the season and is shunned. He starts off coaching for personal gain but begins to grow with the team and teaches them what being a team means. I could keep going on about it but what I'm getting at here is that this movie is almost a shot for shot remake of ""Mighty Ducks"". This one deals with the history of lacrosse in the Native American culture and that part is interesting and the movie is entertaining but don't expect anything original.

As this is not a subject which is highly portrayed in movies we both went with high hopes.

If you are a lacrosse player you should probably buy it (in particular if you know nothing about the sports' background).
