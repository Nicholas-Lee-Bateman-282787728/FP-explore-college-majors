793543,A236PDCSYIOQBU,B00015HVME,"K. Cope ""Kcope""","[1, 1]","but what I got was a redneck Caddyshack II. The premise of the movie has that typical 80s comedy feel to it. A bigwig employee must go back to his hometown and save the brewery that he once worked at.  There's a lot of potential story lines that could follow this plot. Here's a few off the top of my head:1. The movie could take the direction that our main character returns to the town as a ""big shot"", but has forgotten his roots.2. How about the opposite? The town now thinks of him as a ""big city suit"" and he has show him that he is the same guy who left.3. The movie could have focused on his desperate attempts to get his old love interest back.4. The movie could've also focused on his quest to make the brewery better by motivating his under-performing employees.However, the main problem with ""Take this job..."" is that they ""shoved"" all of these plot devices into the movie. And, as the old saying goes, try to please everyone and you end up pleasing no one.***Spoiler Alert*** (Well kind of...it's hard to spoil a movie that doesn't make sense)In the beginning, Frank Macklin (Robert Hays), is driving along an old country road in his ""Fancy Big City Car"". Suddenly, a ""Country Boy Pick'em up Truck"" tries to run him off the road. A dramatic (cough...) car chases ensues, and finally the drivers pull over to have it out. Franklin and the two men yell at each other but then realize they are long lost friends. The problem is that they yell at each other for two minutes before they realize who they are. Sure it's been a few years and they may look a little different, but come on, you can't tell me as good of friends as these guys ""were"" that they don't recognize each other right away.Anyway....his long lost friends, Harry and Ray, seem to love having him back. They take him out drinking and relive old memories. However, once they learn he's there to make changes and possibly give some people the ax, the story suddenly shifts to his friends resenting him. This makes sense after all. I mean, he was one of them, but now... he's a ""city boy"". After his friends fail to show up to work, he finds them drunk in a bath tub singing a (imagine this) Johnny Paycheck song. Frank doesn't give some big speech. They don't have a heart to heart conversation and share their feelings. They don't even really seem to like each other anymore. Frank walks away miserable and his friends are upset, but somehow, in the next scene, they are on his side again. This is my biggest problem with this movie. The story line just jumps so abrubtly from scene to scene that there's no flow in the story. Things just don't make sense.Here's a great example. Harry and Ray wake Frank up in a hotel he's staying in. But they don't just come in and wake him up. You hear a large engine revving outside which startles Frank. Then we see a shot off the door and see Frank in bed. Then suddenly Frank wakes up in a panic and looks over at the door which is now gone. We as the viewer have to figure out that Harry and Ray have used Bigfoot to pull the door off to wake him up. When you have to figure out the jokes it takes away from just how funny the scene could be.Next, there's a scene with Harry and his wife discussing their financial difficulties. He appears quite upset at his current situation and takes it out on his kids. Once again, after this scene, we never focus on his family troubles again and the character seems fine the rest of the movie.The most famous scene from this movie is the truck race. Bigfoot, King of the Monster trucks, makes an appearance here. Apparently, this race is a huge deal in this town but you could never tell from the 3 total spectators present at the beginning of the race.The race begins with a gun shot (BOOM!) and the banjo starts to roll. There are 4X4's everywhere wrecking into each other, passing each other, but there's no clear leader. It's just a montage of trucks running over hills and through mud. Bigfoot, (with rather tiny wheels for a monster truck) is suddenly pushing a yellow truck through the mud. Frank wins, (or at least you have to figure out he's won when he runs over a stick with a flag on it) and everyone jumps in the mud. EVERYONE IN THE MUD!!! Harry, who as a reminder, just had a heart to heart with his wife about their financial troubles, is suddenly making out with a random girl. Then his wife shows up, he pushes her aside and begins to kiss his wife. .....uh...... what????Finally after Franks lame attempt to hook up with his highschool sweetheart, (who ends up sleeping with him anyway), we take a serious look at the problem in the movie. The brewery is to be sold to a ""Texas Big Shot"" who will either start to brew his ""crappy beer"", or just shut down the whole plant. Apparently Franks company, (without Frank knowing) bought the company to sell it for a profit. Well, it isn't an 80's movie without the typical ""Let's band together and come up with a over the top solution to the problem"", so they do. They are going to transform the old brewery into a new brewery and provide competition!! What a great idea! ......cough.....See, no one wants to brew this crappy beer for this Texas guy. They want to keep brewing their local beer so they can drink it for free basically. So Franks idea kind of makes sense. But, After Frank presents the idea to his fellow workers, no one wants to do it. Why? Because ""I don't want to lose my job man..."" Well guess what?? That's the whole point! You either brew this crappy beer and keep working or you lose your job.Frank, angry once again, enters the bar where his buddies are drinking. However in walk the brewery managers (dun dun dun). After an awkward staring contest, a football game involving a roll of toilet paper breaks out. Apparently this is an old game that everyone in the entire bar understands. However, we as the viewer have no idea what's going on. It's like trying to figure out a game of cricket just by watching what happens. The rules seem to be, the first person to get the roll of toilet paper to the door of the bar scores a touchdown. However, you get some pretty sweet A-Team style slow-mo zoom in shots of people flying into and over tables. If you're in to that sort of thing.Well after all that we're at the big climax. Can you believe it??? I can't.... but get ready.Frank ushers the new owner of the brewery into the plant. Frank grabs the gentleman's hat off of his head, and then begins to make fun of him. Meanwhile everyone stares at Frank like he's crazy.Frank then walks over to the beer line and begins throwing beer bottles on the ground. (Yep, he's definitely gone crazy) But Wait!!! The employee who is with him ""understands"" what he's doing and begins tossing bottles around. Suddenly (notice the use of the word suddenly in this review??) everyone starts throwing beer on the ground.Inevitably someone grabs a hose that sprays beer, (cause every brewery needs one of those for all the budweiser girls that come in for ""contests"") and proceeds to spray the boss and the new owner of the brewery for a solid 2 minutes. I'm not kidding either. The spraying with the hose part lasts 2 minutes. It goes from slightly amusing, to boring, to man when is this ever going to stop? Ever see a little kid do something everyone thinks is funny and then they keep doing it over and over? Yeah... like that..Everyone quiets down when the phone rings. Frank answers it. It's his boss, wanting to know how the meeting went. Frank tells his boss to (you guessed it), ""Take this job and...."" Suddenly Johnny Paycheck begins to sing and everyone is okay again. They leave the brewery laughing, joking and slapping each other on the back. Cue Bigfoot driving over the time card booth in a symbolic shove it to the man and.... the credits begin to roll. You enjoy the feel good feeling of Frank quitting, because, we've all wanted to do that.But then it dawns on you... this whole movie was about saving the brewery and the towns jobs... WHAT HAPPENED TO EVERYONE'S JOBS?????? WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BREWERY??? Frank is probably fired, and he'll get a new job no problem, but this brewery was everyone else's livelyhood. It WAS the town. That's what everyone was so concerned about saving it in the first place. Yeesh.....I gotta admit that I had such high expectations for this movie. I've always wanted to see it, mainly because Bigfoot is in it, and I'm a die hard Bigfoot fan. I just found myself constantly so confused with what was happening that I couldn't enjoy the movie. You can tell by pace that production was hurried along. They got the shots they needed, and edited it as quick as possible to get it out before the single went off the charts.",2,I was expecting a redneck caddyshack....,1328140800,"02 2,
