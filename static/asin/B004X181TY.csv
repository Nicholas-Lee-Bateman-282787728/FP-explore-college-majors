1430934,AGEIT17HENDIS,B004X181TY,Alfred Johnson,"[2, 2]","Okay, okay I will freely confess that as a boy I did not, I steadfastly did not, read a girls' book, Charlotte Bronte's  Jane Eyre. And I did not, as we live a confessional age, read her sisters' books or even, damned to hell, Jane Austen's stuff. And you would not have either (or at least not have said so publicly) any place near my corner boys society growing up absurd in the 1950s old North Adamsville neighborhood. See you either didn't read, and made a big virtues out of it preferring chasing cars and girls, or for those like my corner boy, Frankie Larkin, and me, who did we read mad Jack Keroauc, or besotted Scott Fitzgerald, or best of all, the max daddy mad adventurer Ernest Hemingway. Period.Moreover if we didn't read guy novelists then we were crazy (and make that I was crazy) for history books. But not girls' books, no way. Which is a shame in a way because the trials and tribulations of Jane Eyre (and other female characters created by 19th European women writers, and not just women writers either, like the aforementioned Jane Austen) related experiences of class, race and social oppression (intertwined with a little off-hand romance to sell books then, and now, to the female reading public) that resonate with this writer today.So it is something of a gift from the heavens that over the past couple of  decades many of the writers that I did not read, steadfastly did not read in case you forgot, have had their work adapted to the screen. Happily this is true for the film under review. That means that this reviewer gets to, as he has on other occasions, see the story line of the book unfold in order to determine whether he would  decide to read this book after viewing the film.And the judgment? There is now a high bar for British romances set by Ms. Austen, most notably with her Miss Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darby in Pride and Prejudice in the matter of 19th century sensibility. While that standard was not surpassed in this film Ms. Bronte (and the actors here) did give a very decent sense of the oddball (to our eyes), anti-democratic and socially savage way that women, women of no means (or no known means), were shunted off in the backwoods of society.But spunk is a value we can all appreciate and to use a more modern phrase than would be proper in jolly old England back in the day to describe the evolving plot line- a girl has got ot do what a girl has got to do. On that level  this thing is a classic girl (okay woman, Ms. Eyre) meets boy (okay man, Mr. Rochester) story. And, lo and behold, the girl is actually ten times stronger than the boy. And, frankly, twenty times more interesting.  Maybe that is why I, steadfastly, did not read Jane Eyre and the others then.

That which was tedious and compulsory back then certainly came in handy today while watching this version of Charlotte Bronte's classic dark love story.Although the screenplay required some basic knowledge of the original to sort through the flashbacks and shortcuts, and to fill in the blanks for the many omissions therein, the settings, costumes and Gothic creepiness were right on target.  Well cast and acted, Mia Wasikowska and Dame Judi Dench were up to the task, while Michael Fassbender seemed to be a tad cranky and rude at the times when he ought to have been going for ""cold and unapproachable.""

1430942,AO0Y5G7CNS7GT,B004X181TY,AmusingMadWoman,"[2, 2]","My favorite adaptation of Jane Eyre is the Orson Welles version. All subsequent versions have a lot to answer for, so I make a few comparisons between previous versions.Pros:  The casting of this film was a major selling point for me.  Though Jane was not quite as fleshed out as I would've liked, I didn't mind so much given how taken I was by Michael Fassbender as Mr. Rochester.  True, Michael Fassbender is far more handsome than any Rochester should be, but I think he was just tortured and arrogant enough to pull it off.  The scene in which he puts his hands upon Jane and describes here as a mere reed in his hands was pay-dirt for all of us romantic-drama junkies.  That scene alone was worth the price of admission.  Fassbender had all of the intensity and wounded soul interest that William Hurt couldn't pull off in a previous version of the film.  There was a lot more implied ""heat"" between Jane and Rochester that I really enjoyed as something different from other films.  It took some liberties, I think, but never so much that I felt it was untrue to the book.  I think this film did an excellent job depicting Jane's time spent with St. John's family, and gave me a perspective I hadn't had before.Cons:  The ending sucked.  Period.  Yes, yes, I know how it ends, we all do.  But the ending was abrupt to the point of being absurd.  The William Hurt film had a better ending.  Jane's childhood is the launch pad for getting the viewer (or reader) to get in touch with Jane on a personal level.  I felt that it started out fantastic, but her time spent at school was so rushed and skimmed over it didn't have a chance to develop.  Again, the William Hurt film had a far superior childhood depiction, the Orson Welles version even more so.

1430944,A14H1F5YCUEU4J,B004X181TY,Andrew Budgell,"[34, 36]","When a story has been adapted for the big and small screen as many times as Charlotte Bront's 1847 Bildungsroman, ""Jane Eyre"" (nearly two dozen times since the silent era according to my count), there are bound to be some changes in hopes of setting it apart from the pack when yet another incarnation arrives.In director Cary Joji Fukunaga's ""Jane Eyre,"" the story begins out of sequence. Instead of finding Jane as a child, living in the oppressive and abusive Reed household as we do in the novel, the film begins with an adult Jane near starving and near death. Once rescued from the bitter cold by the Rivers family, her past is revealed to us as a flashback. This sequencing makes for a very absorbing film.Every shot of the film is so rich with texture, and composed in such a way that it could be frozen in time and featured in Grace Coddington orchestrated shoot for ""Vogue."" The authenticity is so exacting that at times you can nearly feel the fierce Yorkshire winds chill your bones. Costume designer Michael O'Connor shows appropriate restraint with the costumes (after all, our heroine is a plain Jane), but when his creativity is allowed to let loose, as it is with Mrs Reed and Lady Ingram, he produces some of the most exquisite period costumes I have ever seen captured on film.The cinematography and costuming work most harmoniously together during the wedding scene between Jane (Mia Wasikowska) and Rochester (Michael Fassbender). Attired in her veiled wedding dress, Wasikowska looks so preternaturally beautiful-almost like a specter-echoing Rochester's description of her earlier in the film.Wasikowska, seen last year in Tim Burton's ""Alice in Wonderland,"" makes for a wonderful, three dimensional Jane. She is forceful when it is required of her, but ultimately still manages to remain mousy, just at the character was original written over 160 years ago.

I was hesitant to watch it only because I didn't want my reading pleasure spoiled and yet it was a catch 22 since I either spoil the read or the movie, and since nothings really ever spoiled my read before (I always say, if you want the emotional impact secured, you better see the movie first since the visual swells often outweigh those provided on the written page) I decided to indulge in this lush masterpiece.First of all, this is not `yet another Jane Austen film'.  It's not even written by Jane Austen (it was adapted from the novel written by Charlotte Bronte), even though I can certainly see the comparisons made.  `Jane Eyre' carries with it that thick period drama that Austen was so heavily praised for.  Despite that similarity, there is something darker at play here.  Bronte's prose plays with tonal shifts that Austen would never have entertained.  Where Austen often came off rather light and frothy, even in the midst of tragedy (despite the emotional upheavals in stories like `Sense and Sensibility', the air is almost always crisp with pleasantries), Bronte delves deeper into the haunting quality surrounding life and love found within it.This is most certainly a love story, but one that grounds itself in a darker corner of the human heart.`Jane Eyre' tells the story of a young girl who is mistreated by her aunt and cousin after she is left in her care when her parents die, and then soon thereafter her uncle.  Her aunt is a devil of a woman, unkind and loathsome.  She considers Jane a burden and when she finds an opportunity to unload her on someone else (in this case, a boarding school) she takes it.  Jane is mistreated yet again in the school, but she manages to keep her wits and gain an education that leads to her becoming the governess for the young child of a Mr. Rochester.  In a lavish home, secluded with a precocious child, a kindhearted housekeeper and a brooding beast of a man, Jane begins to find her footing as Rochester's infatuation with her grows into a love she never expected by cannot deny.And then she uncovers his deep dark secret.I just want to take a second to laud the directorial magnificence achieved by Cary Joji Fukunaga.  The breath found in each frame is exhilarating.  He manages to find such emotional depth in the mere framing of his scenes, and that cinematography is outstanding (this film is BEAUTIFUL).  Fukunaga works wonders with his actors here as well.  Dench is so sublime when she plays, well, Dench, and she is perfectly Dench-like in this plum role for her.  Mia Wasikowska is breaking out in some big ways lately, and I'm excited for where her career is going to go.  She is wonderfully reserved and internalized here; carrying with her this stare that says so much more than she wishes it to.  Some have called her wooden (and in the case of that dreadful `Alice in Wonderland' movie, I agree), but her take on Eyre is fantastic, and I'll never forget my adoration of her performance in `The Kids Are All Right'.  The real star here though, is Michael Fassbender.  I have become obsessed with him.  The man is genius.  He just slips into character flawlessly, and his range is undeniable.  As Rochester he is equal parts grotesque and endearing.  He balances out his characters agitated demeanor with this sly arrogance that is oddly charming.His bleeding frustrations are heartbreakingly sincere; and that final scene...UGH...`Jane Eyre' was an unexpected triumph, a film I was anxious to see by weary about the taste level.  There are so many period dramas that wind up being tasteless soap operas that it's really nice to see a film that brings so much `class' to a `classic'.",5,A gothic masterpiece...,1317686400,"10 4, 2011",2011,3823,"[""'m"", 'actually', 'knee', 'deep', 'reading', 'classic', 'novel', 'right', 'now', 'when', 'received', 'current', 'adaptation', 'Netflix', 'other', 'night', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'was', 'hesitant', 'watch', 'only', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'reading', 'pleasure', 'spoiled', 'yet', 'was', 'catch', '22', 'spoil', 'read', 'movie', 'nothings', 'really', 'ever', 'spoiled', 'read', 'always', 'say', 'want', 'emotional', 'impact', 'secured', 'better', 'see', 'movie', 'first', 'visual', 'swells', 'often', 'outweigh', 'provided', 'written', 'page', 'decided', 'indulge', 'lush', 'masterpiece.First', 'not', 'yet', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'film', 'not', 'even', 'written', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'was', 'adapted', 'novel', 'written', 'Charlotte', 'Bronte', 'even', 'can', 'certainly', 'see', 'comparisons', 'made', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'thick', 'period', 'drama', 'Austen', 'was', 'so', 'heavily', 'praised', 'similarity', 'something', 'darker', 'play', 'here', 'Bronte', 'prose', 'plays', 'tonal', 'shifts', 'Austen', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'entertained', 'Where', 'Austen', 'often', 'came', 'off', 'rather', 'light', 'frothy', 'even', 'midst', 'tragedy', 'emotional', 'upheavals', 'stories', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'air', 'almost', 'always', 'crisp', 'pleasantries', 'Bronte', 'deeper', 'haunting', 'quality', 'surrounding', 'life', 'love', 'found', 'it.This', 'most', 'certainly', 'love', 'story', 'one', 'darker', 'corner', 'human', 'heart.', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'mistreated', 'aunt', 'cousin', 'left', 'care', 'when', 'parents', 'die', 'then', 'soon', 'thereafter', 'uncle', 'aunt', 'devil', 'woman', 'unkind', 'loathsome', 'Jane', 'burden', 'when', 'opportunity', 'unload', 'someone', 'else', 'case', 'boarding', 'school', 'Jane', 'mistreated', 'yet', 'again', 'school', 'keep', 'wits', 'gain', 'education', 'becoming', 'governess', 'young', 'child', 'Mr.', 'Rochester', 'lavish', 'home', 'secluded', 'precocious', 'child', 'kindhearted', 'housekeeper', 'brooding', 'beast', 'man', 'Jane', 'find', 'footing', 'Rochester', 'infatuation', 'grows', 'love', 'never', 'expected', 'can', 'not', 'deny.And', 'then', 'deep', 'dark', 'secret.I', 'just', 'want', 'take', 'second', 'laud', 'directorial', 'magnificence', 'achieved', 'Cary', 'Joji', 'Fukunaga', 'breath', 'found', 'frame', 'exhilarating', 'find', 'such', 'emotional', 'depth', 'mere', 'framing', 'scenes', 'cinematography', 'outstanding', 'film', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'Fukunaga', 'wonders', 'actors', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Dench', 'so', 'sublime', 'when', 'well', 'Dench', 'perfectly', 'Dench-like', 'plum', 'role', 'Mia', 'Wasikowska', 'breaking', 'out', 'big', 'ways', 'lately', ""'m"", 'excited', 'where', 'career', 'going', 'go', 'wonderfully', 'reserved', 'internalized', 'here', 'carrying', 'stare', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'have', 'called', 'wooden', 'case', 'dreadful', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'movie', 'agree', 'take', 'Eyre', 'fantastic', ""'ll"", 'never', 'forget', 'adoration', 'performance', 'Kids', 'Are', 'All', 'Right', 'real', 'star', 'here', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'have', 'become', 'obsessed', 'man', 'genius', 'just', 'character', 'flawlessly', 'range', 'undeniable', 'Rochester', 'equal', 'parts', 'grotesque', 'endearing', 'out', 'characters', 'agitated', 'demeanor', 'sly', 'arrogance', 'oddly', 'charming.His', 'bleeding', 'frustrations', 'are', 'heartbreakingly', 'sincere', 'final', 'scene', 'UGH', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'was', 'unexpected', 'triumph', 'film', 'was', 'anxious', 'see', 'weary', 'taste', 'level', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'period', 'dramas', 'up', 'being', 'tasteless', 'soap', 'really', 'nice', 'see', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'class', 'classic']",Jane Eyre [Region 2] [UK Import

This version has plenty of dark overtones for a gothic romance. I watched the deleted scenes that would have made the movie more like the book...I think the director didn't want to draw the audience too deep into the mystery, which is still present in the background. It might have taken away too much from the focus of building the tension and romance between Jane and Rochester, but you can always pretend the deleted scenes were part of the final cut. Also, I think the love story being more prevalent actually helps to add more shock value when the mystery is finally revealed. I am very satisfied with this modern take on 'Jane Eyre', and I am choosing to appreciate it for what it is and not criticize it for what it's not.Wasikowska and Fassbender have excellent chemistry, and both actors are skilled at portraying subtle emotion; their passion is deep but not conveyed in an over-the-top manner. I wouldn't have minded a few more sexually tense dramatic pauses and kissing scenes, but I think we see a good amount of Jane and Edward's affection for each other, possibly more than any other film version.I'm glad I own it, and I will watch it again and again!

But from the very start, I was disappointed, and disappointed that I had to be disappointed!Nothing seemed developed at all. Unless you knew the story before-hand, it would be very difficult to understand what was going on, and the depth behind it. The actresses's portrayal of Jane was the weakest I've seen - where's Jane's quick wit and spunk? Her evening conversations with Mr. Rochester were boiled down to 2 minutes of strained, flat pry-it-out-of-her conversation, instead of the spunky, bluntly honest conversations from the book. Her quietness was over emphasized, leaving her with NO depth, no emotion, no character. The only time you see her ""falling in love"" is of her twirling a flower in her hand, bringing the depth of her emotions down to that of a school-girl crush. There is actually very little interaction between her and Mr. Rochester, and the parts that are there show absolutely no chemistry. Rochester's actor was way too nice! Bronte meant him to be harsh, bitter, darkened, manipulative, haunted by demons of his past, yet able to flash the hand of kindness and emotions. All we see here is brief glimpses of a happy, smiling, contented-looking man. The line in the movie when Jane returns to Thornfield after burying her aunt, and Mr. Rochester says ""Jane Eyre with nothing to say?"" This line amazed me - because all throughout the movie, Jane has said VERY LITTLE, bringing this sentence (although a true statement when held up to the Jane from the book) to having no barring or connection with the story at all.It was impossible to engage with the depth of both of their emotions after the wedding - it made no sense for them to be in such passions of emotions over not being together, when they had barely had any time together, and definitley none that even hinted at such a soul-connection between them. I found myself repeated almost wanting to laugh, as I heard lines that sounded right in the book being used in the movie, but not making sense because of the lack of portrayal of their emotional connection. There is no ""string attached"" to their hearts.If you want a version that captures the essense of the book, even down to using most of the original dialog written by Bronte, watch theJane Eyrewith Dalton & Clark. It's old and the cinematography is old classis BBC...which can take a little while to adjust to.

It may be 500+ pages, but I highly recommend taking the time to read it!(If you're interested in a semi-biographical summary of Charlotte and her family's life, you might want check out the BBC docu-drama ""In Search of the Bronts"" - starring Victoria Hamilton as Charlotte.)_______First off, contrary to this movies preview trailers, there really is no added ""preternatural"" elements at least in the movie itself (which truth be told, was what put me off from watching it right away).  Although, 2 of the deleted scenes have it (specifically the extended scene when Jane is leaving Thornfield Manor, and her lengthened wandering on the moors)....If that's what you're looking for, you'll be sure to find it in ""Wuthering Heights"" by Emily Bront.**Semi-Spoiler**: The movie starts off, basically in the middle or last two thirds of the book.  Which may be a bit confusing to those unfamiliar with the story.  I did read a review though, of a person who went to this film festival, and heard first hand the script writers (Moira Buffini) interpretation of why she chose to write the story the way she did, and the reason the movie  starts with Jane leaving Thornfield, is so the viewer could be pulled into Jane's story right away.____Ideally, it would have been nice if they gave at least 20+ minutes more time to showcase the deeper conversations that Rochester & Jane had, and to prove that it was more than a sudden infatuation that spurred the proceeding relationship (despite their 20 year age difference)...I'm really hoping for a ""directors cut"" to be released in the future!  (In the meantime, I'm really tempted to try my hand at video editing, and insert a few of the significant deleted scenes, and re-burn it to disc.)As noted earlier, the novel is some 500/600+ pages, so really only a miniseries could do it proper justice.However, as a stand alone (2 hour) m-o-v-i-e, all that could be condensed into that time frame without seeming too disjointed, or confusing- was.  In my opinion, it captured the essence of the story quite well!I particularly enjoyed the scenery, costumes, cinematography, musical score.  And last but not least, the cast- especially the leads: Michael Fassbender, & Mia Wasikowska, whose portrayals resonated with me more than most (if not all) of the previous I've seen.  Dame Judi Dench is my favorite Mrs. Fairfax to date!_____Just a quick mention... There's a lot of interesting interviews on YT with the director, and cast.  I just finished watching one called ""Q&A; with Director Cary Fukunaga and Actress Mia Wasikowska Interview Part 1"" filmed March 1, 2011 in front of a live audience (pt. 2 being a Q&A; with the audience themselves).  If you fast-forward to 5:10 you'll hear his take on how he approached the film._____Because of the time constraint, here are some of the more notable omissions/changes  (**SPOILER ALERT**):- Grace Poole (Bertha's nurse).  She was given about 1 minute screen time. In the book she was mentioned, and seen by Jane (as well has had a conversation with) before the whole revelation.- Various extended conversations between Rochester & Jane (namely the proposal, before Jane's leaving Thornfield, and their reunion at the end).- They should have kept one or two of the ""deleted scenes"" (included on the disc).  Specifically the (Jane/Rochester) ""Badminton in the Garden"" conversation; and if not the whole veil ripping scene, at least the part where Jane's recounts it to Rochester, and his response.- The Rochester ""Gypsy"" scene was missing (Rochester's attempt at ascertaining Jane's true feelings towards him).I realize this is probably a difficult scene-- likely one that would require multiple re-takes because I can imagine it would be hard for the leads to keep a straight face during it.Both Michael Jayston ('73), and Timothy Dalton ('83) managed to pull it off, but it would have been interesting to see another attempt (even if it ended up as a bonus ""deleted scene"").- Also, it could have been made clear as to who the Rivers siblings were in relation to  Jane (cousins); which was what ultimately prompted her to divide her 20,000 pound (equal to 1.7 million pounds, or $14.0 million USD in today's value) inheritance equally between herself and the 3 of them.- The tweaked ending (Mrs. Fairfax moved away after the fire; book ending location: Ferndean manor -neither of which are major issues, but worth a mention.  Also, Rochester not only lost his sight, but he also lost a hand and an eye in the fire- which only the '83 has yet to faithfully show), and again- REALLY shortened dialogue._______If you're not willing to read the whole book, I recommend the following chapters (which can be found online for free):- 14 (Second Rochester/Jane conversation--Insight into their characters nature)- 15 (Rochester's Celine Varens revelation; the fire)- 19 (Rochester as the old Gypsy lady)- 20 (Mason attacked; Sunrise garden conversation)- 23 (Proposal)- 27 (Jane/Rochester conversation before she leaves Thornfield)- 37 & 38 (Jane's return, and reconciliation with Rochester)______In conclusion, if you're entirely new to this story, please get acquainted with the book before or after viewing!  If you're not a fan of reading (or listening to an audio book), and you'd rather watch an adaptation- look into the 1973 or 1983 BBC miniseries for an absolute faithful retelling.There is another newer miniseries (2006/07), but for me, the only real advantage it has compared to the '73 & '83 renditions, is that it has the modern cinematic feel/experience (meaning the acting & sets aren't as stiff and theatrical).  On the downside it's pretty flawed in it's interpretation: lines ""dumbed down"", and certain events unfaithfully re-written.  The end result is borderline soap-opera; so for that reason I can only rate it 2 1/2 stars.",5,"A 19th Century Classic, For A 21st Century Generation (4 1/2 Stars)",1337126400,"05 16,

There was no emotion in the characters. Rochester and Jane might as well have been reciting grocery lists they were so blank and deadpan. When Jane asks Rochester if he thinks she is a ""machine"" during the infamous proposal scene, all I could think was ""YES!"" After letting that awful movie stew in my mind for a day or two, I decided to go online and watch the rest to see if I was just in a bad mood during my first watch. Unfortunately, it only got worse! The ending was terrible - just as devoid of emotion as the first half.

The multi-part versions are able to embrace the novel more thoroughly, the feature-length all endeavor to distill and capture the emotional power of the novel.Fukunaga's Jane Eyre is for me one of the most beautifully filmed versions, some scenes simply breath-taking (the carriage returning Jane to Thornfield).  The settings work, the costuming and sets (thankfully) understated.  The cast is outstanding.Where this Jane Eyre gave me problems was the screen play.  While I truly liked the film cleverly opening the way it did (Vol.3 of the novel), the condensing of dialogue felt like short-hand---I was automatically filling in with Bronte's.  I wonder what a new audience gets or misses: the mirroring of the Gateshead family in Vol. 1 with the Rivers family in Vol. 3, the cut-off-from-the-world environment of Lowood and Bertha in the attic.That said, screen play avoided the awkward Eyre-Rivers relationship (they are cousins)and the over-the-top gothic palm reader bit.  The mention of insane asylums conditions added clarity to the often misunderstood situation of Bertha.Whether you love or hate this Jane Eyre, be assured yet another version be made in the next five years as it has since about 1930.",4,This Eyre is Subtle & Sublime,1316044800,"09 15, 2011",2011,1517,"['Having', 'read', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'many', 'times', 'much', 'work', 'novel', 'being', 'very', 'familiar', 'extent', 'movies', 'mini-series', 'wish', 'Amazon', 'would', 'allow', 'give', 'adaptation', '4.5', 'stars.Every', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'something', 'table', 'great', 'appeal', 'generation', 'multi-part', 'versions', 'are', 'able', 'embrace', 'novel', 'more', 'thoroughly', 'feature-length', 'endeavor', 'distill', 'capture', 'emotional', 'power', 'novel.Fukunaga', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'one', 'most', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'versions', 'scenes', 'simply', 'breath-taking', 'carriage', 'returning', 'Jane', 'Thornfield', 'settings', 'work', 'costuming', 'sets', 'thankfully', 'understated', 'cast', 'outstanding.Where', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'gave', 'problems', 'was', 'screen', 'play', 'truly', 'liked', 'film', 'cleverly', 'opening', 'way', 'did', 'Vol.3', 'novel', 'condensing', 'dialogue', 'felt', 'short-hand', '-I', 'was', 'automatically', 'filling', 'Bronte', 'wonder', 'what', 'new', 'audience', 'misses', 'mirroring', 'Gateshead', 'family', 'Vol', '1', 'Rivers', 'family', 'Vol', '3', 'cut-off-from-the-world', 'environment', 'Lowood', 'Bertha', 'attic.That', 'said', 'screen', 'play', 'avoided', 'awkward', 'Eyre-Rivers', 'relationship', 'are', 'cousins', 'over-the-top', 'gothic', 'palm', 'reader', 'bit', 'mention', 'insane', 'asylums', 'conditions', 'added', 'clarity', 'often', 'misunderstood', 'situation', 'Bertha.Whether', 'love', 'hate', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'be', 'assured', 'yet', 'version', 'be', 'made', 'next', 'five', 'years', '1930']",Jane Eyre [Region 2] [UK Import

1430958,A2AN5WDTIQSLWU,B004X181TY,Blue Leaf,"[3, 4]","Of the four adaptions of the novel by Charlotte Bronte that I have seen this one is my least favorite.  The biggest flaw, for myself, was the casting of the two main characters, in particular Mia Wasikowski as the Jane Eyre.  To begin with, in the novel, Jane Eyre was small in stature.  This is a vital apect to the story as her physical demeanor is in direct opposition to her great principles and strong character.  In this adaption her stature was of medium size and the fact that Dame Judith Densch was so much smaller than she made it even more obvious.  The fact that Michael Fassbinder is a handsome man was less distracting because, in general, most of the actors playing Mr. Rochester were in fact very handsome and he did an adequate job in his portrayal but Ms. Wasikowski kept the same expression on her face the entire film.Another problem with this adaption was that, as in other adaptions, two hours in not enough time to do full justice to the film.  One of the best and most interesting parts of the novel are the conversations between Jane and Mr. Rochester.  While Jane is not equal to Mr. Rochester in money they are equal in intelligence and in strength of their convictions.  That is what is so appealing to him about Jane.  Although obviously coming from a difficult childhood Jane Eyre refuses to believe she is any less an individual and never feels sorry for past shortcomings.  The conversations are imperative as Mr. Rochester tries time after time to break down Jane's hard exterior to no avail.  In this film there is only one strong dialogue between the two making their ultimate love story less plausible.I will say give kudos to the cinematography, set direction and costuming as they were all very well done.  The gothic almost ghostlike quality of story was almost achieved.  I did not, as in other adaptions, ever feel put into the hypnotic trance that actually brought me, as the film viewer, to feel swept away to the moors and castles of England in the mid-1800s.My favorite adaption is the 1983 ten part BBC miniseries starring Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton.  If you have not seen it I would most highly recommend it as the adaption that most mirrors the novel.  I have yet to see any actress play Jane as well as Zelah Clarke.  She is petite yet composed and at times fierce in her convictions.  The fact that the mini-series is great in length does the novel its most justice.  Timothy Dalton was quite young at the time but I believe it is his best work to date.  Although exceedingly handsome his composure is perfect for the role.  Their conversations are the most intense and genuine.  Without continuing to make this review more of promotion for the mini-series I will end by saying that if you want to see the best the adaption of the novel the 2011 one is not it.",2,Least Favorite Adaption,1361836800,"02 26, 2013",2013,2815,"['four', 'adaptions', 'novel', 'Charlotte', 'Bronte', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'least', 'favorite', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'was', 'casting', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'particular', 'Mia', 'Wasikowski', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'begin', 'novel', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'was', 'small', 'stature', 'vital', 'apect', 'story', 'physical', 'demeanor', 'direct', 'opposition', 'great', 'principles', 'strong', 'character', 'adaption', 'stature', 'was', 'medium', 'size', 'fact', 'Dame', 'Judith', 'Densch', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'smaller', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'obvious', 'fact', 'Michael', 'Fassbinder', 'handsome', 'man', 'was', 'less', 'distracting', 'general', 'most', 'actors', 'playing', 'Mr.', 'Rochester', 'were', 'fact', 'very', 'handsome', 'did', 'adequate', 'job', 'portrayal', 'Ms.', 'Wasikowski', 'kept', 'same', 'expression', 'face', 'entire', 'film.Another', 'problem', 'adaption', 'was', 'that', 'other', 'adaptions', 'two', 'hours', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'do', 'full', 'justice', 'film', 'One', 'best', 'most', 'interesting', 'parts', 'novel', 'are', 'conversations', 'Jane', 'Mr.', 'Rochester', 'Jane', 'not', 'equal', 'Mr.', 'Rochester', 'money', 'are', 'equal', 'intelligence', 'strength', 'convictions', 'what', 'so', 'appealing', 'Jane', 'obviously', 'coming', 'difficult', 'childhood', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'believe', 'less', 'individual', 'never', 'feels', 'sorry', 'past', 'shortcomings', 'conversations', 'are', 'imperative', 'Mr.', 'Rochester', 'time', 'time', 'break', 'down', 'Jane', 'hard', 'exterior', 'avail', 'film', 'only', 'one', 'strong', 'dialogue', 'two', 'making', 'ultimate', 'love', 'story', 'less', 'plausible.I', 'will', 'say', 'give', 'kudos', 'cinematography', 'set', 'direction', 'costuming', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'gothic', 'almost', 'ghostlike', 'quality', 'story', 'was', 'almost', 'achieved', 'did', 'not', 'other', 'adaptions', 'ever', 'feel', 'put', 'hypnotic', 'trance', 'actually', 'brought', 'film', 'viewer', 'feel', 'swept', 'away', 'moors', 'castles', 'England', 'mid-1800s.My', 'favorite', 'adaption', '1983', 'ten', 'part', 'BBC', 'starring', 'Zelah', 'Clarke', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'would', 'most', 'highly', 'recommend', 'adaption', 'most', 'mirrors', 'novel', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'actress', 'play', 'Jane', 'as', 'well', 'Zelah', 'Clarke', 'petite', 'yet', 'composed', 'times', 'fierce', 'convictions', 'fact', 'mini-series', 'great', 'length', 'novel', 'most', 'justice', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'was', 'quite', 'young', 'time', 'believe', 'best', 'work', 'date', 'exceedingly', 'handsome', 'composure', 'perfect', 'role', 'conversations', 'are', 'most', 'intense', 'genuine', 'continuing', 'make', 'review', 'more', 'promotion', 'mini-series', 'will', 'end', 'saying', 'want', 'see', 'best', 'adaption', 'novel', '2011', 'one', 'not']",Jane Eyre [Region 2] [UK Import

I was waiting for this one to show up at my local movie theaters but it never did, and now I know why - who would want to see it?I found the settings to be very well done - the darkness that comes with gas lighting and small windows left rooms and people only half lit and that has been missed in many other versions. I also found the flash back technique interesting and a good way to tell the story.However, I thought the dialogue was so stilted and almost non-existent that I couldn't find enough to make me believe that an aristocrat would even notice or become entranced by a plain looking governess. The lack of dialogue also creeped me out because Rochester is in his mid 30's and Jane is 19 - without enough talk to convince me that he had found something of real substance in Jane, I had concerns of borderline pedophelia by Rochester - I mean really, why else would a middle aged man be interested in a homely teenager who only says one or two short sentences at each encounter?I look forward to the next version because this one just didn't work for me.Jane Eyre",2,A big disappointment...,1325203200,"12 30, 2011",2011,1198,"['so', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'story', 'have', 'watched', 'most', 'movie', 'television', 'versions', 'was', 'waiting', 'one', 'show', 'up', 'local', 'movie', 'theaters', 'never', 'did', 'now', 'know', 'why', 'who', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'found', 'settings', 'be', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'darkness', 'gas', 'lighting', 'small', 'windows', 'left', 'rooms', 'people', 'only', 'half', 'lit', 'been', 'missed', 'many', 'other', 'versions', 'also', 'found', 'flash', 'back', 'technique', 'interesting', 'good', 'way', 'tell', 'story.However', 'thought', 'dialogue', 'was', 'so', 'stilted', 'almost', 'non-existent', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'enough', 'make', 'believe', 'aristocrat', 'would', 'even', 'notice', 'become', 'entranced', 'plain', 'looking', 'governess', 'lack', 'dialogue', 'also', 'creeped', 'out', 'Rochester', 'mid', '30', 'Jane', '19', 'enough', 'talk', 'convince', 'had', 'found', 'something', 'real', 'substance', 'Jane', 'had', 'concerns', 'borderline', 'pedophelia', 'Rochester', 'mean', 'really', 'why', 'else', 'would', 'middle', 'aged', 'man', 'be', 'interested', 'homely', 'teenager', 'who', 'only', 'one', 'two', 'short', 'sentences', 'encounter', 'look', 'forward', 'next', 'version', 'one', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'me.Jane', 'Eyre']",Jane Eyre [Region 2] [UK Import

As with many films nowadays I simply rented this because I have little time to see everything I want to in the theatre. I was floored by what I saw. I knew nothing of this story and, thankfully too, as this film has some dark secrets. As I was watching I was even wondering if this was about to become a vampire film. This gothic style  film comes about as close as possible to being a  horror film without actually being one. It was gorgeously photographed, well acted, and had a beautiful score that I grabbed the very same night I rented the film. The main character Jane Eyre is a fully realized and entirely complete character. Her past history is shown along the way, as most of the film is a flashback. Despite her harsh upbringing she manages to retain her integrity along the way. So often I expected her to snap and take revenge on some witch  of a character along the way but instead she retains her composure and remains true to herself and beliefs. She does snap once as a kid. This film has a religious undercurrent and subtleties regarding love that may not be for everyone. This is a love story but it is also a film about our stations in life and how just being true to oneself is all we need ever be. I watched it twice in one night and think this is one of the best films I have seen all year. It is one of the best period films i have seen in a very long time and right up there with Barry Lyndon and some Merchant Ivory films.

In the 1996 version, William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsborough gave stellar performances in a movie that stuck so close to the book it amazed me. Even in the 1997 Jane Eyre starring Samantha Morton and Ciaran Hinds there was more liveliness and passion between the hero and heroine.This movie begins near the end of the story. And then it brings in enough flashbacks to leave the viewer confused. My daughter and I waited for action that never came: like the more dramatic scene in the 1996 version where Mr Rochester suddenly appears through the mist and his horse is 'bewitched' and throws him. There is no scene where Mr Rochester tells Blanche to her face that the lady is only after his money. Also, there was NO 'fire' scene whatsoever, only a droll tale of Mrs Fairfax's version of what happened...Regrettably, even the ending left me to see that 'yes, the characters have reunited' but as we true Jane Eyre fans know, in the XXXVIII Chapter: Jane says: 'Reader, I married him. A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson and clerk, were alone present...' Such a scene would have done wonders for this rather passionless movie...Scenes dragged on so that I wished for a powerful ending that was never to be! For, wouldnt the viewer have wanted to know that in two years, our hero Mr Rochester regained some sight so that: 'When his first-born was put into his arms, he could see that the boy had inherited his own eyes... On that occasion, he again, with a full heart, acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with mercy.'Can YOU imagine this 2011 version having such an ending? Don't alot of us wish!

The acting is brilliant at times (others it is as if they're saying, ""okay, I just closed this door - next scene!""), the scenery is lush, the score is quiet nice. But, hands down, it definitely gets my vote for the WORST adapatation of Jane Eyre imaginable.  Aside from the brilliance of the actors (which is why I increased the rating to a two-star instead of one), there is very, very little in this movie that actually flows like the book.  However, I digress.  One of the worst parts of this movie is when Jane hears Rochester calling her. This movie has St. John and Jane outside and he's yelling at her.  As she turns to go up through the weeds, St. John yells as asks her why she's talking to the wind.  You scarcely hear Rochester at all.  Now, for those of you who don't realize this, Ms. Bronte was a Christian and a pastor's daughter.  Thus, this book definitely has instances in it that if you really are not following the Lord, you're not going to understand it completely.  The part in which Rochester is calling Jane when they're so far apart, actually happened to Ms. Bronte (check that out in her biography).  Again, God does things like that in our lives from time-to-time so well, someone trying to interpret that in a movie that isn't a Christian, well, then, it's like trying to read someone else's mail and making sense of it.  You just can't. Read Ms. Bronte's biography and you'll understand my next statement: I honestly think that Ms. Bronte would scream if she saw this movie!As a romance, the most romantic part of that book, in my opinion, is when Jane goes out to meet Rochester after Bertha rips her wedding veil.  It's pouring down rain, miserable, nighttime and windy.  In this movie, it's broad daylight and very sunny.  Instead of pulling Jane up on the horse with him, she just puts her head on his leg while he's sitting on the horse!  We won't even talk about all the dialogue liberties that were taken, the change of the storyline, just about anything you can think about happened in this movie.  It's just so choppy and doesn't make much sense, really.  The casting of Mia I thought was great - she even resembles Ms. Bronte, and Michael Fassbender was another good choice.Okay, I saved the best for last.  When Jane leaves Thornfield after the failed marriage, instead of having her sneak out while everyone is still sleeping, having her grab a piece of bread on the way out, they have Jane JUMPING OUT OF HER BEDROOM WINDOW!  You even get to see her land on the ground after falling from a second story window!  And, if you listen in the beginning of the movie, her room is in the back of the house.  Why now, all of a sudden, has her room changed and she's in the front going to the road?  SO WEIRD!Anyway, grab the book, just read it and forget about the movie portion.  There really isn't a good one out there that actually has been able to truly capture the heart of this book and it's characters and overall moral story.  After one viewing, mine's going to be sold on ebay!

1430985,ASQ8KNNP3A7FP,B004X181TY,"Danusha V. Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[16, 23]","Cary Fukunaga's 2011 ""Jane Eyre"" is a boring, dreary, monochromatic, misconceived botch. Fukunaga doesn't know who Charlotte Bronte is, but he sure knows his Igmar Bergman. He takes a wild, beloved and accessible book about a vibrantly alive girl and turns it into a pointlessly morose, dry and impenetrable film class experiment. One must ask: why was this film even made? There are so many adaptations of ""Jane Eyre"" out there, including a zombie version - made before the current zombie trend. Who felt a pressing need for a sotto-voce, mud-colored, depressive and anemic ""Jane Eyre"" without adequate lighting?From the first scenes, watching this movie was tooth-grinding torture. Fukunaga's decision to make the film without lighting was a mistake. A dull, gray palette does not equate great art. If nothing else, ""Jane Eyre"" is one of the most colorful books ever written: there are physical fights, screaming mad women, burning castles, calculating belles, tortured and dying orphans, the reunion of long-lost relatives and long-lost lovers, psychic communication, murder attempts, big dogs, and fetching French dancing girls. There are profoundly poignant relationships, not just between Jane and Rochester, but between Jane and Bessie, a servant in her aunt's home, Jane and Helen Burns, a fellow orphan, and Jane and her student, Adele. You really can't film all that in an unlit, dun-colored setting with near-catatonic performances and expect to do it any justice at all. You are just torturing your material for no good reason, trying to turn ""Jane Eyre"" into something it is not.Also, ""Jane Eyre"" is a *gothic* novel. Gothic tales are supposed to be presented in a manner that is creepy, hair-raising, and over-the-top. There are scenes in ""Jane Eyre"" that cry out for expressionist lighting and ominous music - like in the 1944, Orson Welles / Joan Fontain version which, if nothing else, captured Jane's early years as an impoverished orphan, and the gothic atmosphere, very well.Jane Eyre, the book's eponymous heroine, is the reason to read the book. Scenes of the mistreatment of small children by callous exploiters are bearable because righteous and irrepressible Jane is your guide through all the bleakness, misery, and injustice.""Jane Eyre"" 2011 attaches leeches to this little firebrand and attempts to bleed her dry. In the opening scenes of the book, the reader immediately knows that this is one spunky heroine who, fist balled and spine stiff in the face of earthly power, will take the reader for a bumpy but unforgettable ride. Jane fights back. Jane demands respect. Jane stands up to everyone, from a cousin who beats her, to a rich aunt who controls her fate, to a sadistic manager of an orphanage, to her ""master"" at her first job. Jane never stops giving lip, standing up, insisting on the worth of one of the most wretched of the earth.""Jane Eyre"" 2011 opens with Jane sobbing and wandering aimlessly and prostrate on a rock. Why did Cary Fukunaga turn vibrant, feisty, colorful Jane Eyre into this limp, gray, pathetic loser? Was the real Jane of the book too much for him?There's one good bit in this botch: Michael Fassbender is an excellent Rochester, one of the very best. Enjoying his performance got me through this film. Mia Wasikowska could have made for a very good Jane, but her performance, like the rest of the film, is drained of passion. It's as if Fukunaga instructed his performers to play every scene as quickly and flatly as possible: ""Here you are asking her to marry you. Play it as if you are asking her which subway train goes uptown. And remember - you are distracted, not really present, and in a hurry."" There's no feeling in anything here, and ""Jane Eyre"" is one of the most feeling books ever written. It is a deeply passionate book, and this film is as flat as cold as and as dry as the tundra.

Blankenship,"[6, 7]","I am giving this one four stars simply because it entertained me, the scenery and props were great and I am rather fond of this particular story.  This is of course the most recent remake of the wonderful Bronte classic.  I am not sure how many shootings of this film have been made over the years but it is probably one of the most done and done again stories available. As I said, I am not sure how many of them there are but I do know, due to my wife, that I have seen them all down through the years.  There are many reasons for this of course but there are great pitfalls for the producers, directors and actors.The first of course is that viewers will be constantly comparing it to the last remake or the original.  There have been some splendid versions of this movie already made and lets face it, they are tough acts to follow.  If you read the reviews here you will find there are a lot of unhappy movie watchers due to this remake thing.Second, there are Bronte purists...a hardcore bunch of folks who show no quarter in their distain for anything that slightly deviates from the original novel.  I know how they feel.  I am a Tolkien purist and even though the movie, Lord of the Rings was a fine film, I still fussed and whined each and ever time the story line was not the one I had in my head after reading the books (many times).This particular film did leave quite a number of key scenes out from both the book and the previous movies.  I will be honest and tell you that I was not happy about this.  On the other hand, had I not seen those other versions or read the book, then I would have thought this film to be just fine and dandy.  There is also the actors.  While I applauded the fact that the makers used Mia Wasikowska in the staring role, I was not all that happy with Michael Rassbender.  Mia is not a raving beauty...I love her looks and find them fascinating but lets face it, she could be considered by many to be just a bit on the plan side.  This was how the original book character was.  As to Michael - I like his acting but for the life of me I simply could not place him in this role in my mind.  He simply is not ruthless and hard looking like the character of the book. I felt at times there could have been a bit more passion displayed between the leading lady and man.  But hey, this is just me.  Obviously and rightly there are other opinions as to the casting.I was not happy with the tinkering of scenes and events that took place and have to admit to having been thrown off until I picked up the rhythm of the movie.But overall, I simply blocked from my mind (what little of that there is) past versions of this book and indeed, the book itself, and simply tried to enjoy the movie as a stand-alone.  I was entertained and to be quite frank, that is really the only reason I bother watching movies for.I debated between the four star rating and a three star rating and decided to give it the benefit of a doubt.  This is one of those movies I wish I did not have to give a star rating to as it is the sort that you will either love or hat it....each will have to make their own mind up on that count.The quality of the DVD was quite good and I encountered no problems.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks",4,I HAD VERY MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT THIS REMAKE BUT ADMIT I WAS ENTERTAINED.,1330819200,"03 4, 2012",2012,3238,"['am', 'giving', 'one', 'four', 'stars', 'simply', 'entertained', 'scenery', 'props', 'were', 'great', 'am', 'rather', 'fond', 'particular', 'story', 'course', 'most', 'recent', 'remake', 'wonderful', 'Bronte', 'classic', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'many', 'shootings', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'years', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'done', 'done', 'again', 'stories', 'available', 'said', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'many', 'are', 'do', 'know', 'due', 'wife', 'have', 'seen', 'down', 'years', 'are', 'many', 'reasons', 'course', 'are', 'great', 'pitfalls', 'producers', 'directors', 'actors.The', 'first', 'course', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'constantly', 'comparing', 'last', 'remake', 'original', 'have', 'been', 'splendid', 'versions', 'movie', 'already', 'made', 'face', 'are', 'tough', 'acts', 'follow', 'read', 'reviews', 'here', 'will', 'find', 'are', 'lot', 'unhappy', 'movie', 'watchers', 'due', 'remake', 'thing.Second', 'are', 'Bronte', 'purists', 'hardcore', 'bunch', 'folks', 'who', 'show', 'quarter', 'distain', 'anything', 'slightly', 'original', 'novel', 'know', 'how', 'feel', 'am', 'Tolkien', 'purist', 'even', 'movie', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'was', 'fine', 'film', 'still', 'fussed', 'whined', 'ever', 'time', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'had', 'head', 'reading', 'books', 'many', 'times', '.This', 'particular', 'film', 'did', 'leave', 'quite', 'number', 'key', 'scenes', 'out', 'book', 'previous', 'movies', 'will', 'be', 'honest', 'tell', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'other', 'hand', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'other', 'versions', 'read', 'book', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'film', 'be', 'just', 'fine', 'dandy', 'also', 'actors', 'applauded', 'fact', 'makers', 'used', 'Mia', 'Wasikowska', 'staring', 'role', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'Michael', 'Rassbender', 'Mia', 'not', 'raving', 'beauty', 'love', 'looks', 'find', 'fascinating', 'face', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'many', 'be', 'just', 'bit', 'plan', 'side', 'was', 'how', 'original', 'book', 'character', 'was', 'Michael', 'acting', 'life', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'place', 'role', 'mind', 'simply', 'not', 'ruthless', 'hard', 'looking', 'character', 'book', 'felt', 'times', 'there', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'more', 'passion', 'displayed', 'leading', 'lady', 'man', 'hey', 'just', 'Obviously', 'rightly', 'are', 'other', 'opinions', 'casting.I', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'tinkering', 'scenes', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'have', 'admit', 'having', 'been', 'thrown', 'picked', 'up', 'rhythm', 'movie.But', 'overall', 'simply', 'blocked', 'mind', 'what', 'past', 'versions', 'book', 'indeed', 'book', 'simply', 'tried', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'stand-alone', 'was', 'entertained', 'be', 'quite', 'frank', 'really', 'only', 'reason', 'bother', 'watching', 'movies', 'for.I', 'debated', 'four', 'star', 'rating', 'three', 'star', 'rating', 'decided', 'give', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'one', 'movies', 'wish', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'give', 'star', 'rating', 'sort', 'will', 'either', 'love', 'hat', '.each', 'will', 'have', 'make', 'own', 'mind', 'up', 'count.The', 'quality', 'DVD', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'encountered', 'problems.Don', 'BlankenshipThe', 'Ozarks']",Jane Eyre [Region 2] [UK Import

1430989,A1SAPGQD6Z9ZQ0,B004X181TY,D. E. Taylor,"[2, 2]","I enjoyed this movie a great deal and bought it for my home collection. However, my brother who had not read the book watched it with me and asked so many questions it quickly became clear to me that people who have NOT read the book might easily become confused. First of all, this movie starts in the middle of the book and then quickly jumps back to Jane's childhood, which it virtually glosses over, then switches back, with many flashbacks thrown in here and there. Jane's childhood must've taken up about one-fourth of the novel (I am guessing from memory) but the movie gives it about ten minutes, if that, and so doesn't really set up the mood quite like the book did. The movie doesn't make it clear that the treatment of the children at the school caused a huge portion of the student population to die, that Jane survived it while watching her best and only friend die, that she has been mistreated and abused repeatedly by people who she was under the authority of who were supposed to be her protectors, and how all those events impacted the person she became and her hesitancy to trust. It is never explained that Jane's rescuers are her cousins, that they are in need of money and stand to inherit from a relative that died, nor that she is the reason the money is tied up, as she is the main beneficiary. In addition, the scene from the book where Jane is outside with her male cousin on a dark night and hears Rochester's voice on the wind, and immediately and intrinsically knows something is wrong- and vows to herself to go to him- is filmed entirely differently here and with less intensity. The scene I had hoped most for- where Rochester returns home unexpectedly, posing as a fortune-telling gypsy, and the wonderful monologue directed at Jane which reveals his feelings to the reader as he verbalizes them for himself and makes Jane feel she must be dreaming- was not part of this film, nor was it included in the deleted scenes! (Sigh.) Oh yes- and the ending was changed, which isn't bad, but the other one was so good! So why four stars? The acting was superb and the cinematography was wonderful! Michael Fassbender was perfect as the emotional Rochester and Mia Wasikowska was an excellent, intelligent Jane. And don't let me forget to mention Judi Dench who played the role of the housekeeper with such depth and insight she may have improved the character Bront created. The acting really was very good and the chemistry of the two lead actors worked. Yes, the film wasn't perfectly true to the novel but the spirit was the same.

1430990,A1R6RKKE44AYA8,B004X181TY,"Diane K. Miller ""diinIN""","[6, 8]","I didn't think it possible to do justice to this book in a two-hour flick.  I almost didn't watch it, because the last attempt was so deplorable (from 1996).  This turned out to be my favorite of them all, surpassing even the 1983 miniseries with Timothy Dalton.  This version of my all-time favorite book is beautifully, masterfully done.  The second time through, I had my husband watch--a guy who can't stay awake for a 40-minute TV show without commercials.  He was transfixed the entire time, never got up (never happens), and when it was done, said, ""That was a great movie!""This new version is unusual in that it isn't linear.  It starts in the middle of the book, and most of the story is told in flashbacks.  This made it more interesting, and they were able to accomplish more in less time.  The story never felt rushed.  While you can't include all of a 500-page book in any movie or miniseries, they were quite faithful to the book and covered everything that was important.  Characters were well developed.  Mia and Michael did a wonderful job portraying Jane and Rochester, to a degree not accomplished in any previous version I have seen.  I felt that they truly encompassed the people about whom Charlotte wrote, both the innocence, determination, and loneliness of Jane, and the darkness, intensity and passion of Rochester.  Their chemistry was palpable.I would change only two things:  First, to spend maybe a couple minutes more on the reunion at the end.  The director chose to include less dialog, and the effect wasn't lost (sometimes in reading the book, I'd find myself thinking, ""Jane, will you just stop talking!"" though in that last scene, it was Rochester resisting).  Second, I would make it more clear that Rochester was actually calling out to Jane at the very moment she heard him from many miles away.  On a side note, he didn't lose his hand here.  In other versions, it was somewhat awkwardly done, as you can't cut off the hand of the actor, so I preferred this approach.I would HIGHLY recommend watching deleted scenes.  Some of them were wisely removed.  Others should have remained and would have added much to the telling (the badminton scene being one of them, wherein Rochester explains to Jane how he ended up with Adele, and also the scene where he begged for Jane at her bedroom door, showing his desperation and despair and broken heart).The musical score reminded me of The Village, and I read through the entire (very long!) list of credits at the end to determine whether this was actually Hilary Hahn on the violin.  It wasn't, but sounded much like her, which is a great compliment to the violinist, Jack Liebeck.  Speaking of credits, it was nice that they included everyone, from the stand-ins, to the drivers, to the trainees--even a contact lens specialist!Director Cary Fukinaga should be proud.  He accomplished the seeming impossible.  This has become my favorite movie.",5,Masterfully done!!

Orson Welles' Mr. Rochester sticks in the mind, not so much for its closeness to what Bronte might have imagined, but for its sheer bravura.  Charlotte Gainsbourg's Jane Eyre was a waif with a surprising strength of character.  This version has a winsome performance by Mia Wasikowska as the eponymous heroine; an innocent trying to make her way in a world apparently peopled by sadists and rapacious men.  Michael Fassbender turns in a one-note characterization of Rochester; all smoldering eyes and winsome expressions, he wheedles his way into Jane's heart to such an extent that she cannot forget him.  The ending is a bit of a cop-out, as Jane reunites with the (now-blind) Rochester in a gesture of reconciliation, without there being any justification for such a move.  Rochester in the main behaves despicably, as does Jamie Bell as Rivers.  The film contains the usual visual clich&eacute;s associated with costume drama - old houses, period costumes and slow-moving shots of the landscape in vivid autumn colors.

This is the 6th film version of JANE EYRE I have seen - and it is no improvement over the other four lousy versions. The best versions are Orson Welles' version and the most popular version starring William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg (my and my wife's most favorite).Jane Eyre (the stunning Aussie beauty Mia Wasikowska, whose career is deservedly skyrocketing) makes her way through her story with a few flashbacks to the old boarding school rather than through narration, essentially kicking off the story someplace near the end when she is sheltering with St. John Rivers (an impressive Jamie Bell, I LOVE this man and his career is also shooting astronomically). There the flashbacks to childhood take place, soon overtaken in a clumsy manner by flashbacks to her beginnings with Edward Rochester (an equally beautiful Michael Fassbender).This is an unfortunate endeavor because I see the story bumping along, one scene abandoned for the next and dialogue as sparse as trees in Texas. Though the always awesome immortal Dame Judi Dench gives a charming and realistic turn as old Mrs. Fairfax, that is a negligible inducement. In point of fact this a more depressing, far less charming version than any I have seen. And that in spite of the fact that the cast is so damned beautiful. Mia is an absolute beauty and a favorite of mine; Bell is a long-time crush and Fassbender is just as desirable.In other words, they are all MISCAST.I do not want to take away from the richness of the art direction, the detail, the realism of the few words that are spoken here. (Though I was bothered by the northern accents, especially coming from Mr. Rochester) All four principal players are giving it their all and it has value. All I can add is that I was most unimpressed and at times outright bored. Crucial lines and locations were missing from this version - I think that spoils this film. Or spoils the usual joy I get from experiencing the story, anyway.You might enjoy this, indeed, it might be your ""first Jane Eyre love"", as the William Hurt version is mine, though I cut my teeth on the novel, then on Welles' 1944 version. In this film, there is too much of the mockumentary camera movement, too much spooky Gothic spice emphasized by purely candlelit scenes, too many dark, unfathomable rooms and hallways. The director (Cary Fukunaga, who basically has accomplished bugger-all so far) also loves his lingering close-ups when they don't seem necessary.All in all, I am glad for the experience of having seen this.

As it is , it is a mediocre telling of the story, passable and worthy of a viewing, but nothing beyond that.Told in an unconventional way, this version uses flashbacks as a basis for getting through much of Jane's story, pretty much ditching the ""voice over"" narration. We are taken back to Jane's early upbringing and subsequent arrival at Thornfield, and then fast forward to later portions. While this is a fresh approach to the story, the one negative is simply that it is  harder to get fully invested in the plot's momentum, one minute Jane being a young girl, the next a governess, then back to her as a young girl. The jumpy narrative destroys a little of the novel's power.Another issue is characterization. For instance, the scene where Jane and Rochester meet could have been handled better. Fleeting moments are scattered throughout that depict Jane and Rochester relationship, but for the most part these are taken on in a superficial fashion, a bit dumbed-down. Rochester, cynical and alienated in other films, comes across as way too sympathetic. Not only that, but where is Rochester in the film's first thirty minutes? There are several scenes that really don't capture the power they could have had, either because they are glossed over artificially or they lack any conviction. Also, this version misses chunks of significant plot essential to forming characters and their motives (such as the relevance of Grace Poole).I don't want to be overly critical, because it is a decent film. One plus of this version is simply the ambience, the dark feel of the story, especially at Thornfield. A mystery lies within those walls and we can feel that in Jane's exploration of the place. The scenery and ""feel"" of the story is definitely there.However, this film doesn't have any qualities that make it noteworthy. In the end, I felt it was a lukewarm effort, where you really don't feel too much either way how things turn out.

Launay,"[92, 102]","Even though many have seen at least one or two film adaptations of Bronte's blockbuster gothic romance novel...there is still plenty of good reason to see this version.  I think that Mia Wasikowska's acting is pitch-perfect - maybe even the definitive characterization of this fascinating woman. She knows that she has been unlucky, but is intelligently waiting, watching, and analyzing everyone before she makes her next move.The time and place - England's North country mid -nineteenth century.  Jane is unloved by her aunt, and after a fight with her cousin is shipped off - rather brutally - to a boarding school run by a self-important and cruel headmaster.  She develops one friendship there - a girl called Helen - but loses Helen to an illness.The beginning of the altercation between Jane and her male cousin is nerve shattering as he bashes her head into a wall, and she (deservedly) hits him back. Of course - the aunt sees and hears only wants she wants to observe...and Jane is conveniently eliminated from the family.During the prison like experience in Lowood School,  Jane becomes ""educated"" to serve the elite. After some mysterious circumstances, she secures a job as governess of a female ward of Sir Edward Rochester.  He and she develop an uneasy friendship at first - which ultimately blooms into love...as both have had very difficult pasts and need to repair their souls.  I enjoyed Jane's character telling the truth in a polite way when she tells Mr. Rochester at one point he speaks nonsense.If I could offer one small critique - the early history of Jane Eyre is skipped over rather quickly. The meanness of the boarding school (Lowood School) is rather underplayed...and the necessary friendship with Helen is just a glimpse.  It is when Jane Eyre comes to Edward Rochester's manor house titled Thornfield Hall, that Mia Wasikowska shows her passion and thoughtfulness.  She is remarkable in showing just the right amount of wilfulness and submissiveness as an employee of Mr. Rochester - and just the right amount of beauty and plainness.  There are moments when the true yearning for intimacy of Jane Eyre is glimpsed - as, for example, when she secretly studies one of the erotic paintings of Edward Rochester at night by candlelight.The cinematography is appropriately gloomy for the mood of the picture.  In summary, this is a very worthy adaptation of an important work of English literature.

I've seen paintings of Charlotte Bronte. She didn't look like Mia Wasikowska.What makes this version the most egregious in this area is that BOTH actors are beautiful. In most versions, they have a gorgeous Rochester (which I'm sure would make Charlotte laugh pretty hard, unless it made her cry with frustration)  and a Jane played by an actress who is plain by Hollywood standards (and would probably be the prettiest girl in the room anywhere else), or a lovely Jane and a homely Rochester (George C. Scott, Orson Welles).  In this one we have not one, but TWO hot to trot Hollywood gorgeous actors playing a man repeatedly described in the book, including by Jane herself, as ugly, and a woman who is called a little toad and someone formed for labor, not for love.What is so odd about this is that British productions DO cast plainish actresses and actors, all the time.  They cast a plain actress to play the beautiful Esther in Bleak House.  They cast Burn Gorman to play a hot, sexy doctor on Torchwood.  Why is it that casting directors are so skittish about Jane Eyre?  Why the Mia Wasikowskas and Toby Stephens and Timothy Daltons?The closest to getting it right is the one with Samantha Morton, a good looking woman who can be made to look homely with the right lighting, and Ciaran Hinds who again is somewhat good looking but not handsome in the usual sense. In this version, the derogatory comments about Jane, and Rochester's severe insecurity, make sense.In five years, when they make another Jane Eyre, here's hoping they have the guts to do what Charlotte Bronte did, make the point that audiences can fall in love with the coupling of a homely  woman and an ugly man.",2,Jane Eyre Goes Hollywood,1316390400,"09 19, 2011",2011,2099,"['have', 'been', 'many', 'thoughtful', 'reviews', 'here', 'giving', 'great', 'praise', 'excoriating', ""'ll"", 'restrict', 'stating', 'what', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'here', 'yet', 'continuing', 'dismay', 'not', 'single', 'version', 'yet', 'Jane', 'Eyre', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'fulfilled', 'Charlotte', 'Bronte', 'vision', 'prove', 'world', 'audiences', 'will', 'fall', 'love', 'ugly', 'hero', 'woman', 'put', 'as', 'plain', 'am', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'paintings', 'Charlotte', 'Bronte', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'Mia', 'Wasikowska.What', 'version', 'most', 'egregious', 'area', 'BOTH', 'actors', 'are', 'beautiful', 'most', 'versions', 'have', 'gorgeous', 'Rochester', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'make', 'Charlotte', 'pretty', 'hard', 'made', 'cry', 'frustration', 'Jane', 'played', 'actress', 'who', 'plain', 'Hollywood', 'standards', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'prettiest', 'girl', 'room', 'anywhere', 'else', 'lovely', 'Jane', 'homely', 'Rochester', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'one', 'have', 'not', 'one', 'TWO', 'hot', 'trot', 'Hollywood', 'gorgeous', 'actors', 'playing', 'man', 'repeatedly', 'described', 'book', 'including', 'Jane', 'ugly', 'woman', 'who', 'called', 'little', 'toad', 'someone', 'formed', 'labor', 'not', 'love.What', 'so', 'odd', 'British', 'productions', 'DO', 'cast', 'plainish', 'actresses', 'actors', 'time', 'cast', 'plain', 'actress', 'play', 'beautiful', 'Esther', 'Bleak', 'House', 'cast', 'Burn', 'Gorman', 'play', 'hot', 'sexy', 'doctor', 'Torchwood', 'Why', 'casting', 'directors', 'are', 'so', 'skittish', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'Why', 'Mia', 'Wasikowskas', 'Toby', 'Stephens', 'Timothy', 'Daltons', 'closest', 'getting', 'right', 'one', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'good', 'looking', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'look', 'homely', 'right', 'lighting', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'who', 'again', 'somewhat', 'good', 'looking', 'not', 'handsome', 'usual', 'sense', 'version', 'derogatory', 'comments', 'Jane', 'Rochester', 'severe', 'insecurity', 'make', 'sense.In', 'five', 'years', 'when', 'make', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'here', 'hoping', 'have', 'guts', 'do', 'what', 'Charlotte', 'Bronte', 'did', 'make', 'point', 'audiences', 'can', 'fall', 'love', 'coupling', 'homely', 'woman', 'ugly', 'man']",Jane Eyre [Region 2] [UK Import

I particularly liked Michael Fassbender as Rochester because he portrays an essential duality of his character.  He is the one in control (because he is the employer) and he plays it with a powerful personal presence while still artfully portraying helplessness in his situation and in his romance with Jane.  In my opinion, this aspect was played better than I've seen it in other versions.  The major flaw in this is the ending is not filled out enough.  The other omissions from the plot didn't bother me but had they added even 1-2 minutes to the final scene it would've been worlds better.This is not my favorite version.  I think both Mia and Michael are too attractive for the roles, but their chemistry is amazing.  My favorite version is the 1983 version with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton.  It's more in depth in all aspects, and the ending is played out more fully than this one, leaving the viewer more satisfied.  Zelah amazes me.  Timothy amazes me (Rochester is much more interesting than James Bond :S)This worst version in my opinion is the 1996 version with William Hurt.  Very forgettable.

1431007,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004X181TY,Grady Harp,"[4, 5]","Though there have been many versions of Charlotte Bront's 1847 Victorian novel JANE EYRE the current incarnation as sensitively written for the screen by Moira Buffini and directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga at least for this viewer is the strongest thus far. Much of the flavor of this production is due to the spectacularly atmospheric production design by Will Hughes-Jones, the appropriately Victorian musical score by Dario Marianelli and the fine cinematography by Adriano Goldman.  And added to the responsible staff should be mentioned  the casting by Nina Gold who has assembled a mixture of famous actors with a supporting cast of excellent neophytes.The surprise member of the cast is Mia Wasikowska as the most fully realized Jane Eyre on film (and that is in the company of such greats as Charlotte Gainsbourg, Samantha Morton, Susannah York, Zelah Clarke, Sally Ann Howes to mention a few).  Wasikowska keeps Jane's focus clear throughout, never bending from her individuality nor her convictions.  She is completely believable in the role of a Governess to Ad&egrave;le (Romy Settbon Moore), a brave young outspoken lass to her evil Aunt (Sally Hawkins), a good friend to the housekeeper (Judi Dench), a responsible teacher for the missionary St John Rivers (Jamie Bell) and his sisters Diana (Holliday Grainger) and Mary (Tamzin Merchant), and most importantly she stands up to her own coming of womanhood  to the harsh Edward Fairfax Rochester (Michael Fassbender).  The story weaves back and forth and in this non-linear style we grasp the real essence of how Jane Eyre grows into the woman she becomes - despite a wretched childhood with her aunt, her misery n the boarding school, and her sense of being a poor girl who must be in service to the wealthy.  It all works very well, even the treatment of Rochester's mad wife who dwells in the upper room of the mansion and haunts those below until she comes to an end.  Though the story does not end happily, it provides a very satisfactory concept of life in the Victorian era.But sailing above everything is relative newcomer Mia Wasikowska in a powerful performance, equaled by her love interest Michael Fassbinder.

Then on the director's cue there is a cut while he adds a comment before we proceed to the next exchange of lines, and so on. Very ""Teleprompterish"".Second, the acting itself was just bland, wooden.Third, there is something too artificial about period movies that use museum quality clothing, props, building and grounds.

The technique of telling most of the story as a flashback is a bold move, but honestly, I found it to be distracting. The score by Dario Marianelli (Pride And Prejudice) is excellent, and there are some good moments between Jane and Mr. Rochester. Unless you know the story very well (and I've read the novel several times, the last one being around six months before this version came out, so I do know the story very well), you will find yourself asking, ""What exactly is going on here?"" Plus, there are a lot of moments from the novel which are cut out from this adaptation that are present in other film versions, notably the 1983 version starring Timothy Dalton (which is my personal favourite). For instance, Adele's backstory is merely hinted at, and Mr. Rochester's climactic scene with Jane is nowhere near as dramatic as in the 1983 version. Plus, I found Ms. W.'s Austrailian accent very distracting (Jane Eyre is English, according to the book). I recommend this movie for only people who know the story very well; otherwise, you'll probably think that the original novel is boring and thereby close yourself off to some of the greatest literature ever written.

Raise your hands all you guys who aren't English lit majors or otherwise had the book assigned and have actually read Charlotte Bronte's novel.  Me either, so although I've heard of Rochester for most of my sentient life, this very good movie was my first exposure to the whole tale.  And quite the tale it is.  Spoiler alert -- in the 19th century, people get their just rewards.  It sometimes takes longer than expected, is often not exactly as first promised, and is always, always circuitous.  But you get what you deserve.  And so with Jane.  Perhaps the greatest accomplishment of the movie is making its star Mia Wasikowska, who I didn't realize was the daughter in The Kids Are All Right,  look plain.  She is a beauty and Jane's plainness is only accomplished through indirect camera angles and oblique lighting.  Hats off to the cinematographer for that and for the numerous scenes of the moors' beauty.  Director Fukunaga tells his tale with fluid, occasionally confusing flashbacks.  He has Judi Dench on board as Rochester's housekeeper, always a welcome if sometimes hammy development.  It takes the better part of an hour for Jane Eyre to launch, but once it does, in a scene where Jane causes Rochester's horse to start, throwing him, all the rest is very entertaining.

I just finished watching the dvd directed by Cary Fukunaga from a screenplay by Moira Buffini. My initial reaction is that this 2011 version started near the ending... Jane lost on the moors...taken in by the Rivers household, St. John and his sisters.  True fans of Charlotte Bronte's classic novel may applaud the novel beginning (we do have our favorite parts, don't we?), but others could be a little lost at the beginning if they didn't know the story well!The uneven reversal of events is not the only problem I encountered.  I am not a purist when watching this classic on film, but did you see the ""deleted scenes"" feature? Some very good lines and scenes were edited from this production! The happy and explanatory scenes - Adele and Jane playing badminton in the beautiful garden, Blanche Ingram's remarks to Rochester that ""all old houses have a gray lady: I think I just met yours,"" Rochester's explanation to Jane about Adele's circumstance and his pleas for her not to leave after the aborted wedding (really, his shouting ""Jane"" from the window from whence she had just jumped needed a prelude!). Don't you think it was rather badly edited?I believe the director's stress on the gothic elements both in scene and music was a bit overdone. Jane Eyre is not a horror film but a Gothic romantic thriller...the strange puffs of smoke and mysterious lights and dark and gloomy scenes were too strange, mysterious and dark and gloomy. There is a happy but abrupt ending but one gets used to that in JANE EYRE films. Oscar award-winning Dario Marianetti's score was hauntingly beautiful but very repetitious. It did achieve Fukunaga's idea of gypsy-like fiddler work though. But we were treated to less of Jane Eyre's ""tale of woe"" than I can ever recall. (Perhaps this is a good thing: I was rather amused that one reviewer remarked that this film just ""breezed past the difficult childhood."")I was very pleased in the principal acting roles. Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fussbender were much better than George C. Scott and Susannah York in the 1970 version. And Fussbender smoldered almost as much as my favorite Rochester, Timothy Dalton in the 1983 BBC production.And how could I forget the wonderful Judi Dench as Rochester's housekeeper?

Like many other reviewers, I'm a die-hard Jane Eyre fan, having read the book too many times to count and seen at least 6 film adaptations (I think there have been at least 8). This dvd is the 5th I've added to my collection, which my children find absolutely hilarious. But anyway, I wanted to see this one at the theater but it was only in my hometown for about a week, so I ordered it as soon as Amazon had it. I guess I should just lay out my pros and cons and let the chips fall where they may.Pros: The casting is possibly the best of any version I've seen. Mia Whatchamacallit (sorry, can't remember her name right now) was 21 when the film was shot, making her about the right age to play Jane. All the other versions I've seen cast actresses who were well past their teen years, so it was good to see a more-age-approriate Jane. She also did a nice job with the role, expressing shades of emotion in her face since her lines are frankly rather limited. Michael Fassbender is honestly too young (34) and too good-looking (he was the smokin' hot warrior Stelios in 300) but does a very good job inhabiting the character of Rochester. He's very gruff with just the right hint of humor to make Rochester the irritating but somehow intriguing guy he is. The other roles were also well-cast. Judi Dench is always amazing, and Jamie Bell (though not as handsome as St.John should be, imho) was appropriately stern. The cinematography of the movie is just lovely. I really liked the lighting. Everything at Gateshead is sunlit and colorful, belying the hellish existence Jane endures there. Lowood school is spare and colorless, and Thornfield is mostly lighted from underneath with the only light falling on the characters seeming to come from candles and fireplaces. This creates an air of mystery and confusion as the viewer can never really get a good enough view of the place to even be sure of its layout. I liked the notion of starting the story with Jane's escape from Thornfield and the rest being told in flashback, but I can't say if that would be confusing to someone unfamiliar with the story or not.Cons: I suppose nobody could condense this huge novel into a 2 hour movie and not leave out something I thought was important, but I felt too many details were omitted. Jane's character development as well as that of the relationship between Jane and Rochester were dealt with so quickly that they lost some of the depth of emotion they should have had. The conclusion of the film occurs so abruptly that I got a bit angry. It was sort of a ""You've got to be kidding!"" reaction that it just suddenly ended without what I thought was adequate closure. Some scenes, such as Jane's flight over the moors, were lovely but rather long, and I found myself wishing some of those scenes had been cut to give more scenes that ""fleshed out"" the story.So my mixed reaction still allows me to recommend the movie. I think it is a good and respectful adaptation of one of my favorite novels as well as a visually lovely film with a solid cast.",4,A Mixed Reaction,1315180800,"09 5, 2011",2011,3122,"['what', 'have', 'watching', 'dvd', 'twice', 'decidedly', 'mixed', 'reaction', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', ""'m"", 'die-hard', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'fan', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'count', 'seen', 'least', '6', 'film', 'adaptations', 'think', 'have', 'been', 'least', '8', 'dvd', '5th', ""'ve"", 'added', 'collection', 'children', 'find', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'anyway', 'wanted', 'see', 'one', 'theater', 'was', 'only', 'hometown', 'week', 'ordered', 'as', 'soon', 'Amazon', 'had', 'guess', 'should', 'just', 'lay', 'out', 'pros', 'cons', 'let', 'chips', 'fall', 'where', 'may.Pros', 'casting', 'possibly', 'best', 'version', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Mia', 'Whatchamacallit', 'sorry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'name', 'right', 'now', 'was', '21', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'making', 'right', 'age', 'play', 'Jane', 'other', 'versions', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'cast', 'actresses', 'who', 'were', 'well', 'teen', 'years', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'more-age-approriate', 'Jane', 'also', 'did', 'nice', 'job', 'role', 'expressing', 'shades', 'emotion', 'face', 'lines', 'are', 'frankly', 'rather', 'limited', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'honestly', 'too', 'young', '34', 'too', 'good-looking', 'was', 'smokin', 'hot', 'warrior', 'Stelios', '300', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'inhabiting', 'character', 'Rochester', 'very', 'gruff', 'just', 'right', 'hint', 'humor', 'make', 'Rochester', 'irritating', 'somehow', 'intriguing', 'guy', 'other', 'roles', 'were', 'also', 'well-cast', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'always', 'amazing', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'handsome', 'St.John', 'should', 'be', 'imho', 'was', 'appropriately', 'stern', 'cinematography', 'movie', 'just', 'lovely', 'really', 'liked', 'lighting', 'Everything', 'Gateshead', 'sunlit', 'colorful', 'belying', 'hellish', 'existence', 'Jane', 'there', 'Lowood', 'school', 'spare', 'colorless', 'Thornfield', 'mostly', 'lighted', 'underneath', 'only', 'light', 'falling', 'characters', 'seeming', 'come', 'candles', 'fireplaces', 'air', 'mystery', 'confusion', 'viewer', 'can', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'good', 'enough', 'view', 'place', 'even', 'be', 'sure', 'layout', 'liked', 'notion', 'starting', 'story', 'Jane', 'escape', 'Thornfield', 'rest', 'being', 'told', 'flashback', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'would', 'be', 'confusing', 'someone', 'unfamiliar', 'story', 'not.Cons', 'suppose', 'nobody', 'could', 'condense', 'huge', 'novel', '2', 'hour', 'movie', 'not', 'leave', 'out', 'something', 'thought', 'was', 'important', 'felt', 'too', 'many', 'details', 'were', 'omitted', 'Jane', 'character', 'development', 'as', 'well', 'relationship', 'Jane', 'Rochester', 'were', 'dealt', 'so', 'quickly', 'lost', 'depth', 'emotion', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'conclusion', 'film', 'so', 'abruptly', 'got', 'bit', 'angry', 'was', 'sort', ""'ve"", 'got', 'be', 'kidding', 'reaction', 'just', 'suddenly', 'ended', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'adequate', 'closure', 'scenes', 'such', 'Jane', 'flight', 'moors', 'were', 'lovely', 'rather', 'long', 'found', 'wishing', 'scenes', 'had', 'been', 'cut', 'give', 'more', 'scenes', 'fleshed', 'out', 'story.So', 'mixed', 'reaction', 'still', 'recommend', 'movie', 'think', 'good', 'respectful', 'adaptation', 'one', 'favorite', 'novels', 'as', 'well', 'visually', 'lovely', 'film', 'solid', 'cast']",Jane Eyre [Region 2] [UK Import

The tender scenes between the two love birds left me feeling uncomfortable and hoping for a second take. Also - Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender do not fit the description of Jane and Mr. Rochester. Key elements of the classic story are Jane's slightly homily face and Rochester's savage looks.

That being said, it's been singular that until this there hadn't really been a satisfying adaptation of JANE EYRE since the Robert Stevenson version from the 1940s with Joan Fontaine (who was, admittedly, too pretty and too docile to be a believable Jane Eyre) and Orson Welles. But this one, directed by Cary Juji Fukunaga is pretty good. The moors are shot gorgeously, to make them look like nothing else on earth; the score by Dario Marinelli, is just about perfect (atmospheric and romantic without being intrusive); and the two leads, Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender, are quite fine--both are attractive, yet neither is so classically pretty that it seems unlikely they would describe one another as plain. Granted, the story is too rushed; but how else are you going to shoehorn in 500 pages worth of plot into a two-hour movie? (Remarkably, they even manage to get the St. John Rivers story into here, which the Stevenson version eschewed.) Its only other failing is that it's probably not scary enough: you don't get the great architectural sense of Gothic space and the looking ""third story"" that you do, say, in the Stevenson version.

Alas, this Jane Eyre suffers very much from the same problem that bedeviled the Keira Knightley version of Pride and Prejudice: there is simply no way to tell the story coherently in two hours.  And starting the film with Jane running away from Thornfield and then flashing back to the events that brought her there simply confused the plot.The film is like a disjointed sequence of scenes following each other because so many scenes were omitted from the book to make the movie fit into its time frame.  There is little time for character development and less for plot development.  Visually the movie is beautiful, the cinematography is outstanding, but there just isn't enough movie to do justice to the story.  And of all the people to delete from the film version, they should never have omitted Grace Poole, the taciturn keeper of the mad Mrs. Rochester who is a small but absolutely central character in the book.Mia Wasikowska (I was tempted to copy another reviewer and call her Mia Whatchamacallit but I did take the trouble to look up her name) is an excellent Jane, showing much of the charm and naivete she exhibited in Alice in Wonderland.  And she looks just right for the part, very young and pale and somewhat plain and mousy.  Judi Dench is a charming and likable Mrs. Fairfax.  The rest of the cast is also very good, although I wouldn't say outstanding, with the glaring exception of Michael Fassbender as Mr. Rochester.  Fassbender simply is not Rochester.  I found him just lukewarm instead of displaying the brooding passion that made Orson Welles and Timothy Dalton so memorable in that role.Overall, it's not a bad version of Charlotte Bronte's masterpiece, but it's a fair-to-middling movie of one of the greatest novels in English literature.

Michael Fassbender creates a living and breathing Rochester who is powerful, sensitive and magnetic - the two actors, together, truly create magic on-screen - I would say this is easily my favorite version of ""Jane Eyre"", by a wide margin. Without great central performances like these all would have been for nothing, but, fortunately, the actors delivered the goods, and then some (Wasikowska is truly a revelation). The film, however, has everything else going for it, too: the direction, the script, the brooding and gorgeous cinematography and a score that is one of the most memorable I've heard in some time (it accompanies and supports all the scenes perfectly and also holds up on it's own). This was such an exquisite film that I had to go back and read the novel all over again - I hadn't read it since I was a teenager - when I did, I couldn't help but picture Mia Wasikowska, Michael Fassbender and Dame Judi Dench as the characters - I now probably always will.

Fans naturally have their favorite parts and their own impressions of characters. The story is probably too big to be covered comprehensively. Related, films tell stories in different ways from written words so some alterations and abridgements are necessary.This movie version of Jane Eyre is faithful to the book. It follows events mostly in the same order, though the movie begins with her flight from Thornfield Hall. The story before that is inter-cut with her arrival and life with the Rivers family. The settings are quite realistic, with the bleak moors and the dark buildings matching the novel's descriptions. The world of Jane Eyre is well-realized and atmospheric.The plot is a mixture of too much being left in and too much being left out. All the major movements are in this movie: living as a child with her aunt, going to Lowood School, working as a governess at Thornfield Hall, interacting with Rochester, separating from Thornfield and Rochester under fantastic circumstances, living with the Rivers, etc. With only two hours of screen time, a lot of the details are left out of each of these. For instance, Blanche Ingram makes her appearance as a romantic rival for Rochester's affections. He seems to have genuine affection for her in the film but his ultimate choice of Jane has no inciting incident as it does in the book. The gypsy fortune-teller scene is not in the movie and nothing substitutes for the revelations of Blanche's superficiality and Jane's perceptivity. If the film makers had, for example, relegated the Lowood part of the story to a two-minute conversational recap at Thornfield they would have had more time to fully develop this part of the story. As a movie, I don't think it held the story together well enough.The performances are generally good, though I thought Mia Wasikowska was a little too understated as Jane. Jane in the novel has a lot more passion and wit, though perhaps readers have more access to that since the narrative is told by her. In the movie, we are in a third-person narrative without access to her thoughts and feelings except for what the actress shows us. I thought the performance was a bit too reserved. The performance is serviceable but not great. Michael Fassbender is good as Rochester and Judi Dench as Mrs. Fairfax.The movie ultimately feels like a Cliff's Notes version of the book with a couple of pages missing. The deleted scenes on the DVD fill in some of the holes but not all of them. The highlights of the book are in the film but what makes Jane Eyre a great story and her a great character doesn't come across.

1431035,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B004X181TY,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 4]","I am a virgin to Jane Eyre, having never read the Charlotte Bront novel nor seen any of the multitudes of cinematic adaptations that were bore from it. Counting only the adaptations that share the same name, this 2011 version is the tenth film based on the novel, although several of the early ones are lost to time. This latest vision boasts a California-born director and an Australian and a German in the lead roles. Not the most likely people you'd expect for the adaptation of a thoroughly English novel, but once the film begins it quickly becomes irrelevant. It's with sadness that I realize how long I was unaware of the greatness of Jane Eyre, but with glee that it took this film to open my eyes.For many, the plot of Jane Eyre may be a product of common sense rather than acquired knowledge, but I confess that I knew very little before endeavoring to watch it. For those like me, I'll attempt to keep elements of the plot brief so as to not spoil anything. The film opens with the present Jane Eyre (played by Mia Wasikowska) and allows the core of the story to unfold in flashback. Jane grows up an orphan, raised by her cruel aunt (Sally Hawkins) and is eventually sent to Lowood, a charity school for girls, with a rigidly sadistic faculty. Once she leaves Lowood Jane is invited by the sprawling, isolated manor Thornfield Hall. Thornfield Hall's housekeeper Mrs. Fairfax (Judi Dench) offers Jane a job as a governess over the master's ward, a young French girl named Adele. The mysterious master is Edward Rochester (Michael Fassbender), who, after a short time, reveals himself at the manor. Despite his position as master and Jane's position as subordinate, the two strike up a rapport as equals despite there being something markedly sinister about Mr. Rochester.Jane Eyre is directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, whose film debut, the Spanish-language Sin Nombre, was released to great acclaim in 2009. A Californian director of Japanese and Swedish descent may not be the obvious choice for this adaptation, but his direction is flawless. From the fade in, Fukunaga instantly captures the tone with a perfect dreary, gloomy look that creates the most effective kind of cinematic atmosphere. To simply label Jane Eyre atmospheric is to understate its effectiveness. It's enveloping and evocative, gaining your complete attention with its affirmed stranglehold on the essence of Gothic Romance.A period drama typically emphasizes tone and character over simple narrative and with performances that are nothing short of hypnotic, this is no exception. Wasikowska is flawless as the title character, appropriately vulnerable but with a commanding sense of confidence. After rising to prominence in the billion-dollar hit Alice in Wonderland, she has steadily made her mark as an actress in much smaller films. She has the fame, but she seems determined to get the respect and thus far she's succeeding admirably. Michael Fassbender has also appeared in small, yet consistently great, films while flirting cautiously with the mainstream. Here, as in other roles, he has almost radioactive presence. When Rochester appears, he's not a suave, charming fellow but a blunt, formal, and stern man. Simultaneously, he does possess an intense, almost frightening, animal magnetism as well. Together, Wasikowska and Fassbender are fluent in the poetry of the dialogue and speak it with great fervor. Their performances are fascinating to watch and both have a command over the screen whenever they grace it with their presence. Meanwhile, Dame Judi Dench provides a quiet austerity to her role and gives a quiet performance that is no less impressive than her co-stars. Sally Hawkins, who has seemed incapable of playing a role without a distinct vibrant giddiness, proves that she can indeed inhabit a wretched character. The performances are more than Oscar-worthy, but due to how early Jane Eyre was released in 2011 it will likely be overlooked come voting time. Hopefully the Academy will avoid such a tragedy and keep this film in the forefront of their mind.Elegantly is the only adverb that springs to mind when describing how this film was made. The subtle foreboding of the art direction by Karl Probert, the beauty of the cinematography by Adriano Goldman, the lovely music by Dario Marianelli that quietly accentuates each scene, and the complete control over visual style and consistency of tone that comes from director Fukunaga. The film, for two of the five senses, is a beauty to behold. Absolutely dripping with atmosphere, Jane Eyre is one of the best films of the year. A great story, marvelously told, expertly made, and beautifully acted. A gorgeous, compelling period drama that is completely accessible to a modern audience without ever trying to be.GRADE: A",5,"An Elegantly Made, Atmospheric, and Beautiful Film",1313712000,"08 19, 2011",2011,4785,"['am', 'virgin', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'having', 'never', 'read', 'Charlotte', 'Bront', 'novel', 'seen', 'multitudes', 'cinematic', 'adaptations', 'were', 'bore', 'Counting', 'only', 'adaptations', 'share', 'same', 'name', '2011', 'version', 'tenth', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'several', 'early', 'ones', 'are', 'lost', 'time', 'latest', 'vision', 'California-born', 'director', 'Australian', 'German', 'lead', 'roles', 'Not', 'most', 'likely', 'people', ""'d"", 'expect', 'adaptation', 'thoroughly', 'English', 'novel', 'once', 'film', 'quickly', 'irrelevant', 'sadness', 'realize', 'how', 'long', 'was', 'unaware', 'greatness', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'glee', 'took', 'film', 'open', 'eyes.For', 'many', 'plot', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'may', 'be', 'product', 'common', 'sense', 'rather', 'acquired', 'knowledge', 'confess', 'knew', 'very', 'little', 'endeavoring', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'attempt', 'keep', 'elements', 'plot', 'brief', 'so', 'as', 'not', 'spoil', 'anything', 'film', 'present', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'played', 'Mia', 'Wasikowska', 'core', 'story', 'unfold', 'flashback', 'Jane', 'up', 'orphan', 'raised', 'cruel', 'aunt', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'eventually', 'sent', 'Lowood', 'charity', 'school', 'girls', 'rigidly', 'sadistic', 'faculty', 'Lowood', 'Jane', 'invited', 'sprawling', 'isolated', 'manor', 'Thornfield', 'Hall', 'Thornfield', 'Hall', 'housekeeper', 'Mrs.', 'Fairfax', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Jane', 'job', 'governess', 'master', 'ward', 'young', 'French', 'girl', 'named', 'Adele', 'mysterious', 'master', 'Edward', 'Rochester', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'who', 'short', 'time', 'reveals', 'manor', 'position', 'master', 'Jane', 'position', 'subordinate', 'two', 'strike', 'rapport', 'equals', 'being', 'something', 'markedly', 'sinister', 'Mr.', 'Rochester.Jane', 'Eyre', 'directed', 'Cary', 'Joji', 'Fukunaga', 'film', 'debut', 'Spanish-language', 'Sin', 'Nombre', 'was', 'released', 'great', 'acclaim', '2009', 'Californian', 'director', 'Japanese', 'Swedish', 'descent', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'obvious', 'choice', 'adaptation', 'direction', 'flawless', 'fade', 'Fukunaga', 'instantly', 'tone', 'perfect', 'dreary', 'gloomy', 'look', 'most', 'effective', 'kind', 'cinematic', 'atmosphere', 'simply', 'label', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'atmospheric', 'understate', 'effectiveness', 'enveloping', 'evocative', 'gaining', 'complete', 'attention', 'affirmed', 'stranglehold', 'essence', 'Gothic', 'Romance.A', 'period', 'drama', 'typically', 'tone', 'character', 'simple', 'narrative', 'performances', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'hypnotic', 'exception', 'Wasikowska', 'flawless', 'title', 'character', 'appropriately', 'vulnerable', 'commanding', 'sense', 'confidence', 'rising', 'prominence', 'billion-dollar', 'hit', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'steadily', 'made', 'mark', 'actress', 'much', 'smaller', 'films', 'fame', 'determined', 'get', 'respect', 'thus', 'far', 'succeeding', 'admirably', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'also', 'appeared', 'small', 'yet', 'consistently', 'great', 'films', 'flirting', 'cautiously', 'mainstream', 'Here', 'other', 'roles', 'almost', 'radioactive', 'presence', 'When', 'Rochester', 'not', 'suave', 'charming', 'fellow', 'blunt', 'formal', 'stern', 'man', 'Simultaneously', 'possess', 'intense', 'almost', 'frightening', 'animal', 'magnetism', 'as', 'well', 'Together', 'Wasikowska', 'Fassbender', 'are', 'fluent', 'poetry', 'dialogue', 'speak', 'great', 'fervor', 'performances', 'are', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'have', 'command', 'screen', 'whenever', 'grace', 'presence', 'Meanwhile', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'quiet', 'austerity', 'role', 'quiet', 'performance', 'less', 'impressive', 'co-stars', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'who', 'seemed', 'incapable', 'playing', 'role', 'distinct', 'vibrant', 'giddiness', 'can', 'indeed', 'inhabit', 'wretched', 'character', 'performances', 'are', 'more', 'Oscar-worthy', 'due', 'how', 'early', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'was', 'released', '2011', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'overlooked', 'come', 'voting', 'time', 'Hopefully', 'Academy', 'will', 'avoid', 'such', 'tragedy', 'keep', 'film', 'forefront', 'mind.Elegantly', 'only', 'adverb', 'mind', 'when', 'describing', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'subtle', 'foreboding', 'art', 'direction', 'Karl', 'Probert', 'beauty', 'cinematography', 'Adriano', 'Goldman', 'lovely', 'music', 'Dario', 'Marianelli', 'quietly', 'scene', 'complete', 'control', 'visual', 'style', 'consistency', 'tone', 'director', 'Fukunaga', 'film', 'two', 'five', 'senses', 'beauty', 'behold', 'Absolutely', 'dripping', 'atmosphere', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'A', 'great', 'story', 'marvelously', 'told', 'expertly', 'made', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'gorgeous', 'compelling', 'period', 'drama', 'completely', 'accessible', 'modern', 'audience', 'ever', 'trying', 'be.GRADE']",Jane Eyre [Region 2] [UK Import

Breathtaking, emotionally rich, and ultimately satisfying, ""Jane Eyre"" is utterly true to the book.I rather smiled in reading that another reviewer thinks Timothy Dalton is the best Rochester. That means she has not seen the version with Orson Wells. But I nitpick. Michael Fassbender is superb. Mia Wasikowska is superb. Jamie Bell is excellent (if you can allow yourself to call someone so uptight as excellent, but I'm describing acting). That's it then. That's all you need to know, except the location IS the wild setting of the novel.If I had to pick the most effective aspect of the film, I would tap Director Fukunaga's decision to use a flashback to tell the story. (I don't remember if Charlotte actually wrote her novel this way.) He begins with Jane running, running away from Thornfield, from Rochester. She finally collapses in abject misery, wailing and wailing, with the lonely moors, the stunted shrubs as her cold comfort. She finally stumbles, in numbing despair, at the door of the Rivers family.By the time the flashback wends its way back to the moor scene, the viewer must wail with Jane,  empathetically, completely caught up in her intense feelings for Rochester, instead of coldly watching this scene. The viewer now understands Jane's terrible illness--it's not of the body but of the spirit. Healing does come, and when it does, it allows for a glorious, but bittersweet ending.""Jane Eyre.""

1431049,A3I41MF1O2FAC,B004X181TY,"Laura Merucci ""marspeach""","[4, 5]","I had very high hopes for this film, despite thinking it was too soon for another adaptation. I mean, the 2006 BBC miniseries was released less than five years before this one! As much as I love Jane Eyre, I do think think there's such a thing as adaptation overload. I can't help but feel that they could have adapted another work instead.Overall, my view on the film is that it is a disappointment. It could have been great but it did not meet my expectations. One of my main problems was the structure. The film starts out with Jane fleeing Thornfield and being found by the Rivers. Any scenes from before that point are flashbacks, occasionally coming back to a scene in the ""present"" at Moor House. I remember reading about this choice before the film came out and being hesitant, but I thought it might come out better than I expected. Unfortunately, it did not. The flashback structure was confusing for my friends who did not read the book. To me, it was just an annoyance. I get that they were trying to do something different, but it just didn't work for me in practice.I think that the film could have benefited from about 10-20 extra minutes of run-time. A lot of the explanations and backstories are cut out. What really bothered me about this is that it looked like more things were actually originally filmed, but left on the cutting room floor. The DVD confirmed my suspicions on some of this- plenty of deleted scenes on it should have been left in the film, IMO! I do not know why some of them were cut. Because I saw the film with several people who did not read the book, I know that a lot of it was confusing. And for me, even though I knew the backstory, I was just irritated not to see it! One major thing I felt they should have done with extra time would be to show more buildup to Jane and Rochester's relationship. Some of their scenes together are great, but they needed more of these before they actually got engaged to show and explain their growing attraction more.As to the actors, I found much of the acting to be understated. In some cases I liked this approach more than in others. Mia Wasikowska is not plain, but I thought they made her look the part well enough in terms of age and stature. I found her acting, however, to be underwhelming. I thought her performance was too restrained. In the proposal scene, in particular, I thought she held back too much. I don't want Jane to be over the top, but I wanted a little more passion. A lot of focus in this version seemed to be put on Jane wanting freedom and developing into a woman, but I could have done without the scene of her examining the painting of a naked lady. Not that I had any issues with the picture, but the scene accomplished nothing (that time could have been better spent elsewhere) and this ""nude image"" was part of the reason the film got a PG-13 rating. While Michael Fassbender was also a bit more restrained than some other actors (especially compared to Timothy Dalton, my favorite), I liked his performance more than Mia's. The two did have good chemistry, but there just weren't enough scenes to show them falling in love. Bertha, I felt to have not enough of a presence. Grace Poole was really just in the background and so there was never any of Jane suspecting her. Bertha herself was not as menacing as she could have been. I suppose they did not want to be offensive but she just wasn't scary enough. The Rivers siblings were all good in their roles, but I was not a fan of the change made to their relationship with Jane.I don't want to make it seem like I completely hated this film, because I didn't. I thought that the scenes of Jane's childhood were particularly well-done, especially given the short time-frame. Many individual scenes were great. On the whole, I just found it to be slightly lacking.

1431059,AN94YI3URSAII,B004X181TY,Lostgirl,"[17, 21]","Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books ever, but it's adapted very frequently for film and stage. The last screen adaptation was the 2006 BBC version and that was a stand out for me. But generally I think that unless a filmmaker has something special to do or say about this particular work, Hollywood might be wise to look to other classics for adaptation. However I'd heard excellent things about the most recent big screen version of Jane Eyre and after listening to an interview with the director on NPR in which he promised his new film played up the gothic elements of the story in a way that other versions hadn't, I had hopes that while it wasn't strictly necessary it might be darn good.It's not. Not that it's terrible, it's just ""blah"". Mia Wasikowska was miscast as Jane. For one thing she's too pretty for the role. For another I didn't get  much sense of an inner life. Not that it was bad acting per se. She smiled at the right moments and cried at the right moments, but really I got no indication of an actual personality from her Jane. Michael Fassbender was OK as Mr Rochester but nothing special. The biggest problem there is that he and Mia have very little chemistry together. Also he proposes after what seems to be three conversations. We don't get any sense of any relationship there because most of significant events are left out. If I hadn't read the book I'd have no idea why Blanche Ingram was there to begin with!  I did like Judi Dench as Mrs Fairfax and Sally Hawkins as Aunt Reed. But Mrs Fairfax and Aunt Reed shouldn't be my favorite characters!Small choices made by the the filmmakers bothered me. For example, When Mr Rochester proposes to Jane the whole part with the lightening striking the tree is left out. Bye bye foreshadowing. Another thing I disliked was that the whole first half was told in flashback while Jane was with St John Rivers and his sisters. I was hoping that the purpose of this was to cut down on the time that was devoted to a fairly dull, but necessary for plot, part of the story. But no. Even after the flashbacks end, bringing us back to the ""present"" we still need to see Jane with the Rivers' family for a while longer. And then, when she leaves (talking to Mr. Rochester's voice which she hears in the air, and looking like a lunatic) her return to Thornfield and to Mr Rochester is brushed over in about five  minutes. When Pride and Prejudice was adapted in 2005 I complained  that looked more Bronte than Austen with it's wild, windswept moors. Well this looks more Austen than Bronte. Thornfield is a well lit house, and gardens are perfectly manicured (I thought the director said he was playing up the gothic elements!). It's worth a watch on DVD, don't get me wrong. It's not a terrible adaptation and it's pretty to look at.

What livens it up are the tragic lives of the leads, Jane Eyre, who always tells the truth and is repressed-- she confuses repression with morality. Then there is Edward Fairfax Rochester, a rich lord who wants to enjoy life but can't, as he is restless and has to deal with his insane wife, Bertha Antoinette, who keeps trying to burn down the house and kill her brother--yet, perhaps the brother, Mason, deserves it. His character appears too briefly to know anything about him.The major fault with the film is that it shifts back and forth too often, shuffling Jane's life story. The scenes of her schooling are only hinted at, much left out. The story -- novel and filmed versions -- are an indictment of cruelty disguised as morality. It has been described as a Gothic thriller, but Jane Eyre here is more of a morality play, with much suggested and not made explicit. Christianity is up for criticism here, as a structure to destroy one's self-worth and create self-loathing. It is an argument for showing that Christianity is for life-haters.As a Gothic it has its stereotypes, many of which in fact pre-date Charlotte Bronte's novel: the poor orphan girl who becomes wealthy, the ruined country estate, the insane wife in the attic -- not even that is original to Jane Eyre. It is merely the most famous example of a Gothic novel.This is not really a horror film, it is too quiet to call it that, but it is a tragedy, where injustice and terrors occur. There is a somewhat happy ending, but only of a sort.Michael Fassbender makes a good Rochester, but even his performance is restrained, for he too is repressed. This is in fact the point, both Eyre and Rochester are wronged, repressed individuals who find each other, yet a happy ending is not to be. After all, the manor house burns down and he is blind.For awhile Jane took comfort with a Minister Saint John, who eventually proclaims to love her, but she realizes she still loves Edward, and she suspects Saint John will be a controlling, hard man; she prefers Edward Rochester and flies to him. Are they happy in the end? Hard to say, as the film ends abruptly.The director uses fire in many ways, as light, as warmth, as signals to mysterious events, as a shift in tension. Fire is used an artistic symbol through the film, signifying many things.The DVD has 4 extra features, an audio commentary, a feature about the music, and two on the story, with actors and crew making observations on the script and the setting.",3,Rather slow but a good version,1401926400,"06 5, 2014",2014,2610,"['new', 'version', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'rather', 'slow', 'even', 'when', 'trying', 'compact', 'whole', 'novel', 'two', 'hours', 'Much', 'boring', 'What', 'up', 'are', 'tragic', 'lives', 'leads', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'who', 'always', 'truth', 'repressed', 'repression', 'morality', 'Then', 'Edward', 'Fairfax', 'Rochester', 'rich', 'lord', 'who', 'enjoy', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'restless', 'deal', 'insane', 'wife', 'Bertha', 'Antoinette', 'who', 'trying', 'burn', 'down', 'house', 'kill', 'brother', 'yet', 'perhaps', 'brother', 'Mason', 'character', 'too', 'briefly', 'know', 'anything', 'him.The', 'major', 'fault', 'film', 'back', 'forth', 'too', 'often', 'shuffling', 'Jane', 'life', 'story', 'scenes', 'schooling', 'are', 'only', 'hinted', 'much', 'left', 'out', 'story', 'novel', 'filmed', 'versions', 'are', 'indictment', 'cruelty', 'disguised', 'morality', 'been', 'described', 'Gothic', 'thriller', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'here', 'more', 'morality', 'play', 'much', 'suggested', 'not', 'made', 'explicit', 'Christianity', 'up', 'criticism', 'here', 'structure', 'destroy', 'one', 'self-worth', 'create', 'self-loathing', 'argument', 'showing', 'Christianity', 'life-haters.As', 'Gothic', 'stereotypes', 'many', 'fact', 'pre-date', 'Charlotte', 'Bronte', 'novel', 'poor', 'orphan', 'girl', 'who', 'wealthy', 'ruined', 'country', 'estate', 'insane', 'wife', 'attic', 'not', 'even', 'original', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'merely', 'most', 'famous', 'example', 'Gothic', 'novel.This', 'not', 'really', 'horror', 'film', 'too', 'quiet', 'call', 'tragedy', 'where', 'injustice', 'terrors', 'occur', 'somewhat', 'happy', 'ending', 'only', 'sort.Michael', 'Fassbender', 'good', 'Rochester', 'even', 'performance', 'restrained', 'too', 'repressed', 'fact', 'point', 'Eyre', 'Rochester', 'are', 'wronged', 'repressed', 'individuals', 'who', 'find', 'other', 'yet', 'happy', 'ending', 'not', 'be', 'manor', 'house', 'down', 'blind.For', 'awhile', 'Jane', 'took', 'comfort', 'Minister', 'Saint', 'John', 'who', 'eventually', 'love', 'still', 'Edward', 'Saint', 'John', 'will', 'be', 'controlling', 'hard', 'man', 'Edward', 'Rochester', 'flies', 'Are', 'happy', 'end', 'Hard', 'say', 'film', 'abruptly.The', 'director', 'fire', 'many', 'ways', 'light', 'warmth', 'signals', 'mysterious', 'events', 'shift', 'tension', 'Fire', 'used', 'artistic', 'symbol', 'film', 'signifying', 'many', 'things.The', 'DVD', '4', 'extra', 'features', 'audio', 'commentary', 'feature', 'music', 'two', 'story', 'actors', 'crew', 'making', 'observations', 'script', 'setting']",Jane Eyre [Region 2] [UK Import

But I had a few problems.  As soon as the movie came on, I was like ""why are they starting the movie in the middle of the book??"", but I soon got over that and got into watching.  I just didn't ""feel"" the connection between Jane and Edward like I did with other adaptations.  With the Cirran Hinds version, 1/2 way through the movie is was so obvious they were in love, not so with this one.  If I'd never seen the others or read the book, I'm sure I'd have felt like ""when did that happen??"".  Judi Dench, as always, gave a stellar performance.  She is one top-notch actress, one of my favs.  but, when Jane goes back to Thornefield and finds it burned out and abandonded, then suddenly,completely out of no where, Mrs. Fairfax ""appears"" to tell Jane what happened?  So NOT believable.  it's been abandoned by everyone but her??  it would have been so much better to just allow Jane to find out as the book laid it out.  and then we came to the end. *sigh*.  I felt cheated, ""is that it???"".  There was so much conversation between Jane and Edward in those last pages of the book, that they could have used in the movie and not taken up too much more time.  at least in the Hinds version just before the credits rolled, you see Edward and Jane strolling with their baby and looking so happy.  This one just left me feeling deflated.  I give it 4 stars because over all it is a very good movie, and the acting and the musical score was outstanding, but the directors/writers/producers could have done so much more for so little more running time and made it a much better movie.

But I think I can offer some perspective.If you've never read Jane Eyre, then you'll find this movie to be a pleasant period costume drama, with a splendid stately home setting. However, the first thirty minutes of flashbacks will surely be confusing, since so much of Jane Eyre's youth is compressed here. As the movie settles into the love affair with Mr. Rochester, it begins to make more sense. If you don't plan on reading the novel (a pity), a quick perusal of a plot summary would surely be of help in fleshing out the missing parts before you settle in with the DVD.If you read the novel a long time ago, the movie may whet your appetite for the real thing. It will conjure up scenes you thought you'd forgotten. And take it from me, the novel is best enjoyed the second or third time, particularly if you read it--or were forced to read it-- when you were too young. In this sense, the left-out parts, particularly Jane's life at Lowood School, may lead you straight back to the book. Who could argue with that?And if Jane Eyre is a novel that is a favorite of yours, you'll find this film a decent one with which to while away a couple of hours.

Plenty of haunting scenery, subdued characters ready to explode, smoldering, restrained love story, and moody music to boot.I've seen all the other versions and like them, more or less.  My favorites are the one with Ruth Wilson/Toby Stephens and the one with Charlotte Gainsburgh/William Hurt.  How can one lose with this kind of material?Mia Wasikowska portrays Jane as she should: independant, longsuffering, other worldly.  She's strong but vulnerable- a deeply wounded herione.  Yes, the actor is beautiful, but it's cinema, and they try to make her plain.  She's lost and crying for half of the movie, words far and few.Michael Fassbender plays Rochester with sexy verve.  William Hurt was more noble; Toby Stephens more solid with a soft core.  Fassbender plays him more as a stewing nervous, needy wreck.  Beat down by the life he's seen and the burden he carrys.  He hides behind gruffness, teasing, and a threatening persona.Judi Dench plays the concerned housekeeper, and all the actors are fine, but secondary.  This is a movie first and foremost about Jane Eyre and then about her relationship with her love.  It's a big order for Ms. Wasikowska, but I think she pulls it off.The movie starts out about mid story, and then departs on two main tales from different time periods going on with flashbacks.  It's well done, and I didn't mind it.  Sure, there's parts and important characters I wish they didn't leave out, but there's enough, I think, of new to make up for it.  The ending stirs to a quick, subtle finish.  The shortest of all the versions.  After all that pain, more might have been better?In the extras, they show deleted scenes- some significant.  And one can see different camps of thought about where this movie could have went.  One, more maudlin, the other, a horror movie, aka, ""The Shining- the prequel, the Jane Eyre years"".

1431080,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B004X181TY,M. Oleson,"[1, 2]","There have been numerous films made of Charlotte Bronte's great love story going back to the silent era.  This doesn't include scads of TV adaptations that appear every few years.  I think this is my favorite.  Mia Wasikowska stars as Jane giving the story true authenticity as a girl in her late teens.  As is the current flavor in movies today the story jumps back to capture a younger Jane being kicked out of her aunt's home in favor of a school for girls (read orphanage).  The film evolves into the meaty part where Jane (also in flashback) becomes the governess of a young French girl who is the offspring of a tryst between the master of the house, Edward Rochester (Michael Fassbender) and another woman believed to have died.  Although romance in 19th century England is far removed from the mores of modern society, you can see the love spark between Jane and Edward.  What makes this story stand out however is the sliver of horror that haunts the grand old mansion.  If you are not familiar with the plot, there are some unsettling scenes involving thumps, bumps and other sound bursts.  Wasikowska plays the role with intelligence and understated beauty.

1431083,A228JH8V9Y700G,B004X181TY,MortensOrchid,"[0, 0]","Jane Eyre is a staple for all 9th grade English classes and will ensure all readers who read it at age 14/15 (women, at least) that there is a tremendous audience out there for Chick Books as much as there are Chick Flicks.  While the book is beautifully written, not a lot of the movie interpretations have held up over the years.  This version, however, brings a new light onto this classic gothic tale, which was not an easy feat to accomplish but it was still a good version.For the sake of repetition which so many or many not know already, the plot:  Jane Eyre is a poor girl who was orphaned as a child and went to live with relatives.  After her uncle dies, the only one of his family who was happy to have here there, Jane is panned off to a boarding school to live an austere, almost nunlike existence.  This changes her from the temperamental child she was to a tightly contained, eager to please young woman who assumes her place in the world as a governess.  She answers and ad for a young girl who needs a governess at Thornfield Hall, where she meets the dashing Mr. Rodchester, the head of the household.  They fall in love, naturally, and when they are standing before the alter about to marry someone steps forward and says they cannot marry because Mr. Rodchester is already married to the ghost in the attic.  All those bumps and mysterious goings on in place turn out to be Bertha, Mr. Rodchester's insane wife who he has kept locked in the attic for the last fifteen years.  Jane runs away, finds a new family to be with for a flash, and then returns to find Mr. Rodchester blind and the house burned down by Bertha.This movie, however, begins during Act 3 of the book (Jane's running away from Thornfield Hall) rather than the beginning like so many have before.  Most of the story is told in flashbacks (her childhood, first getting the job at Thornfield Hall, etc.).  Most of the tensions are between her and Sinjohn, the man with her new family who discovers what happened and she actually ran away from the situation.  It's difficult to give a new interpretation to things, especially a classic, and expect them to fly with the audience, for that I give this movie and it's cast/crew complete credit.  That guy who plays Mr. Rodchester is HOT, I will not deny that.  And Mia Wasikowska is a nice Jane Eyre.  While she is not a great beauty in real life, they did a good job of uglying her up to make her look worse than she actually does and more appropriate to Jane Eyre.  Judy Dench is in it as well, a wonderful Mrs. Fairfax if there ever was one.Any words of criticism?  Not for this movie, but for Jane's actions in the story.  I realize that she ran away for the sake of drama and storytelling.  I also realize that she ran away because it was morally wrong for her to be with Mr. Rodchester while he was, after all, still married and had hidden the wife (granted, a crazy one) from her.  I agreed with her decision when I first read the book years ago, thinking it was morally wrong, but I see things differently now just like everything else.  Perhaps she ran away because she was too afraid of being involved in the situation.  They took away the factor of ""Jane is annoying to run away from him"" very nicely.  And yes, Bertha can't help being crazy, and Rodchester did try to provide for her a bit better than putting her in a nuthouse; but, if you really love a man who is in such a terrible situation, then yes, bend to it and still be with him.  I admit, like all girls do when they read this story, I was 14/15, virginal and unsophisticated.  I am no longer and far more mature now.  And one of the things that you think when you are just that age when you read it as well as something you hold onto until you are in your mid twenties is that women see themselves as a caregiver to the man.  Admittedly, this is from this eager to please good girl mentality that we are lead to believe will make for a happy life when we are older, but that is something for girls not adult women to aspire to.  Hence a lot of other psychology that will lead women to make bad choices in life, but that's another story.  Here, in the only version I'd ever seen where Jane is not the weak little churchmouse who wants to act like a caregiver / nurse to Rodchester (before and after his accident), she returns because she actually loves the man.  But still, this classic remains with us for a reason and will endure.",4,As modern as you can get with a classic,1402185600,"06 8, 2014",2014,4438,"['Jane', 'Eyre', 'staple', '9th', 'grade', 'English', 'classes', 'will', 'ensure', 'readers', 'who', 'read', 'age', '14/15', 'women', 'least', 'tremendous', 'audience', 'there', 'Chick', 'Books', 'as', 'much', 'are', 'Chick', 'Flicks', 'book', 'beautifully', 'written', 'not', 'lot', 'movie', 'interpretations', 'have', 'held', 'up', 'years', 'version', 'however', 'new', 'light', 'classic', 'gothic', 'tale', 'was', 'not', 'easy', 'feat', 'accomplish', 'was', 'still', 'good', 'version.For', 'sake', 'repetition', 'so', 'many', 'many', 'not', 'know', 'already', 'plot', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'poor', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'orphaned', 'child', 'went', 'live', 'relatives', 'uncle', 'dies', 'only', 'one', 'family', 'who', 'was', 'happy', 'have', 'here', 'there', 'Jane', 'panned', 'off', 'boarding', 'school', 'live', 'austere', 'almost', 'nunlike', 'existence', 'temperamental', 'child', 'was', 'tightly', 'contained', 'eager', 'please', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'place', 'world', 'governess', 'answers', 'ad', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'governess', 'Thornfield', 'Hall', 'where', 'dashing', 'Mr.', 'Rodchester', 'head', 'household', 'fall', 'love', 'naturally', 'when', 'are', 'standing', 'alter', 'marry', 'someone', 'steps', 'forward', 'can', 'not', 'marry', 'Mr.', 'Rodchester', 'already', 'married', 'ghost', 'attic', 'bumps', 'mysterious', 'goings', 'place', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'Bertha', 'Mr.', 'Rodchester', 'insane', 'wife', 'who', 'kept', 'locked', 'attic', 'last', 'fifteen', 'years', 'Jane', 'away', 'new', 'family', 'be', 'flash', 'then', 'returns', 'find', 'Mr.', 'Rodchester', 'house', 'burned', 'down', 'Bertha.This', 'movie', 'however', 'Act', '3', 'book', 'Jane', 'running', 'away', 'Thornfield', 'Hall', 'rather', 'beginning', 'so', 'many', 'have', 'before', 'Most', 'story', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'childhood', 'first', 'getting', 'job', 'Thornfield', 'Hall', 'etc.', 'Most', 'tensions', 'are', 'Sinjohn', 'man', 'new', 'family', 'who', 'what', 'happened', 'actually', 'ran', 'away', 'situation', 'difficult', 'give', 'new', 'interpretation', 'things', 'especially', 'classic', 'expect', 'fly', 'audience', 'give', 'movie', 'cast/crew', 'complete', 'credit', 'guy', 'who', 'Mr.', 'Rodchester', 'HOT', 'will', 'not', 'deny', 'Mia', 'Wasikowska', 'nice', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'not', 'great', 'beauty', 'real', 'life', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'uglying', 'up', 'make', 'look', 'worse', 'actually', 'more', 'appropriate', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'Judy', 'Dench', 'as', 'well', 'wonderful', 'Mrs.', 'Fairfax', 'ever', 'was', 'one.Any', 'words', 'criticism', 'Not', 'movie', 'Jane', 'actions', 'story', 'realize', 'ran', 'away', 'sake', 'drama', 'storytelling', 'also', 'realize', 'ran', 'away', 'was', 'morally', 'wrong', 'be', 'Mr.', 'Rodchester', 'was', 'still', 'married', 'had', 'hidden', 'wife', 'granted', 'crazy', 'one', 'agreed', 'decision', 'when', 'first', 'read', 'book', 'years', 'ago', 'thinking', 'was', 'morally', 'wrong', 'see', 'things', 'differently', 'now', 'just', 'everything', 'else', 'Perhaps', 'ran', 'away', 'was', 'too', 'afraid', 'being', 'involved', 'situation', 'took', 'away', 'factor', 'Jane', 'annoying', 'run', 'away', 'very', 'nicely', 'yes', 'Bertha', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'being', 'crazy', 'Rodchester', 'did', 'try', 'provide', 'bit', 'better', 'putting', 'nuthouse', 'really', 'love', 'man', 'who', 'such', 'terrible', 'situation', 'then', 'yes', 'bend', 'still', 'be', 'admit', 'girls', 'do', 'when', 'read', 'story', 'was', '14/15', 'virginal', 'unsophisticated', 'am', 'no', 'longer', 'far', 'more', 'mature', 'now', 'one', 'things', 'think', 'when', 'are', 'just', 'age', 'when', 'read', 'as', 'well', 'something', 'hold', 'are', 'mid', 'twenties', 'women', 'see', 'caregiver', 'man', 'Admittedly', 'eager', 'please', 'good', 'girl', 'mentality', 'are', 'lead', 'believe', 'will', 'make', 'happy', 'life', 'when', 'are', 'older', 'something', 'girls', 'not', 'adult', 'women', 'aspire', 'Hence', 'lot', 'other', 'psychology', 'will', 'lead', 'women', 'make', 'bad', 'choices', 'life', 'story', 'Here', 'only', 'version', ""'d"", 'ever', 'seen', 'where', 'Jane', 'not', 'weak', 'little', 'churchmouse', 'who', 'act', 'caregiver', '/', 'nurse', 'Rodchester', 'accident', 'actually', 'man', 'still', 'classic', 'reason', 'will', 'endure']",Jane Eyre [Region 2] [UK Import

Edward Rochester's darkness is referred to often in the book--his black hair, dark eyes and dark complexion--and for Bronte they symbolized his precious ""apartness"" from conventional English blondness, and also his spiritual darkness before Jane entered his life. And Bronte's Rochester, beneath his gruff exterior, has a good and kind heart. Fassbinder's Rochester is not just arrogant, he's chronically rude, selfish and indifferent to the suffering of others. Fassbinder has no feeling for Rochester's genuineness of character, the depth of perception that ties him to Jane.His playing of the role is shallow, even condescending.

If you don't know the story, you don't know why she's running blindly across the moors. Even if you do know why, you have no feeling for this Jane Eyre at all.But after processing this dissonance, I could see the beauty of starting the story here. Frankly, I've always thought that the post-Thornfield part of the story with St. John and his sisters was a little long and dull. By fracturing this lengthy part of the book, this movie version deftly dwells on the drama of the Thornfield story.This is a brooding and dark adaptation of the novel. That's a good thing, because it's a brooding and dark story. But I really missed the spark that should be in Jane's soul. As Jane, Mia Wasikowska has the resolve and the inner strength, but she is only given one line in which her sparkle surfaces: ""No, sir, you are not to be trusted at all."" Besides which, about a half an hour into the movie, I noticed how emaciated she is, with that big head look that painfully thin women unfortunately have, and I couldn't focus on the story as I would have liked. I don't know why this is today's conception of beauty. (See Keira Knightly inAtonement.)Michael Fassbender didn't do anything at all for me. Am I the only one who remembers the 1971George C. Scott/Susannah York version? It's still my favorite. It had all the elements of the novel and the characterizations were more complex. Frankly, in this new version, St. John seems like an abuser. That shouldn't be.I became more disenchanted with the movie as it went along, until finally the last scene arrived, one that is delightful for its tender and witty exchange between Jane and Mr. Rochester, giving the reader/viewer the satisfaction of seeing the two roles reversed -- Jane finally in charge, drawing out the denouement, and the humbled Rochester's future in her hands.

1431094,A12FLZREV32JOP,B004X181TY,Noelle Eiram,"[8, 11]","Cary Fukunaga has directed an ethereal version of Charlotte Bront's oft-adapted novel Jane Eyre. The film's muted visuals convey the gothic story's mystery while hinting at its internal passions.Our heroine Jane Eyre's (Amelia Clarkson) youth involves characters who resemble the grim child abusers in a Charles Dickens novel. The plot's pace quickens once Jane (Mia Wasikowska) reaches young adulthood and moves to Thornfield Manor, a forbidding castle surrounded by equally impressive grounds. There she encounters housekeeper Mrs. Fairfax (Judi Dench) and begins tutoring the lord's French ward Adele (Romy Settbon Moore). Mrs. Fairfax tells Jane that Lord Edward Rochester (Michael Fassbender) has moods that are as unpredictable as his travels. Jane feels drawn to Rochester, even though she feels that the more she learns about him, the less she knows.Here Jane's renowned ""plainness"" comes from her soft features and downtrodden position. Wasikowska's youth contributes to the character's believable confusion and sexual curiosity. Most importantly, she conveys Jane's stoicism, wisdom, and imagination. Fassbender's Rochester is slightly frightening but magnetic, amusing, and acutely observant. He tells Jane that she is no more ""naturally austere, any more than [he is] naturally vicious."" She is as sharp, and correctly describes him as ""the most phantom-like of all"" her ""unreal"" experiences at Thornfield. Fukanaga brings out the novel's poetic language, making mere exchanges of words more intense and erotic than many a lovemaking scene.Inspired by Northern English folk music and gypsy fiddling, Daro Marianelli's sweetly passionate score is haunting. Yet the film's painterly aesthetics, from a stormy sunset to the resonant final image, is the movie's most prominent aspect. While Fukunaga's attention to historical detail lends a realistic rawness, the movie's exquisite colors convey a fairy-tale-like quality, accentuating Rochester and Jane's allusions to magic.Thornfield is alternately beautiful and menacing. A naturally-lit nude painting evokes a sense both ominous and sensual, much like Jane's attraction to Rochester. An individual who feels trapped is silhouetted against a window showcasing other worlds. Jane and Rochester are filmed outside in a way that makes them appear to be spirits of nature.Wasikowska sometimes underplays the deceptively tame Jane, and Fassbender is occasionally too dramatic. On the surface, this is a straightforward if suspenseful adaptation of Bront's classic melodrama. But beneath is a rapturous, even transcendent tale.",5,"A Rare, Unearthly Thing",1310083200,"07 8, 2011",2011,2583,"['Cary', 'Fukunaga', 'directed', 'ethereal', 'version', 'Charlotte', 'Bront', 'oft-adapted', 'novel', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'film', 'muted', 'visuals', 'convey', 'gothic', 'story', 'mystery', 'hinting', 'internal', 'passions.Our', 'heroine', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'Amelia', 'Clarkson', 'youth', 'characters', 'who', 'resemble', 'grim', 'child', 'abusers', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'novel', 'plot', 'pace', 'once', 'Jane', 'Mia', 'Wasikowska', 'young', 'adulthood', 'moves', 'Thornfield', 'Manor', 'forbidding', 'castle', 'surrounded', 'equally', 'impressive', 'grounds', 'housekeeper', 'Mrs.', 'Fairfax', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'tutoring', 'lord', 'French', 'ward', 'Adele', 'Romy', 'Settbon', 'Moore', 'Mrs.', 'Fairfax', 'Jane', 'Lord', 'Edward', 'Rochester', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'moods', 'are', 'as', 'unpredictable', 'travels', 'Jane', 'feels', 'drawn', 'Rochester', 'even', 'more', 'less', 'knows.Here', 'Jane', 'renowned', 'plainness', 'soft', 'features', 'downtrodden', 'position', 'Wasikowska', 'youth', 'character', 'believable', 'confusion', 'sexual', 'curiosity', 'Most', 'importantly', 'conveys', 'Jane', 'stoicism', 'wisdom', 'imagination', 'Fassbender', 'Rochester', 'slightly', 'frightening', 'magnetic', 'amusing', 'acutely', 'observant', 'Jane', 'more', 'naturally', 'austere', 'more', '[', ']', 'naturally', 'vicious', 'sharp', 'correctly', 'most', 'phantom-like', 'unreal', 'experiences', 'Thornfield', 'Fukanaga', 'out', 'novel', 'poetic', 'language', 'making', 'mere', 'exchanges', 'words', 'more', 'intense', 'erotic', 'many', 'lovemaking', 'scene.Inspired', 'Northern', 'English', 'folk', 'music', 'gypsy', 'fiddling', 'Daro', 'Marianelli', 'sweetly', 'passionate', 'score', 'haunting', 'film', 'painterly', 'aesthetics', 'stormy', 'sunset', 'resonant', 'final', 'image', 'movie', 'most', 'prominent', 'aspect', 'Fukunaga', 'attention', 'historical', 'detail', 'realistic', 'rawness', 'movie', 'exquisite', 'colors', 'convey', 'fairy-tale-like', 'quality', 'accentuating', 'Rochester', 'Jane', 'allusions', 'magic.Thornfield', 'alternately', 'beautiful', 'menacing', 'naturally-lit', 'nude', 'painting', 'sense', 'ominous', 'sensual', 'much', 'Jane', 'attraction', 'Rochester', 'individual', 'who', 'trapped', 'silhouetted', 'window', 'showcasing', 'other', 'worlds', 'Jane', 'Rochester', 'are', 'filmed', 'way', 'appear', 'be', 'spirits', 'nature.Wasikowska', 'sometimes', 'underplays', 'deceptively', 'tame', 'Jane', 'Fassbender', 'occasionally', 'too', 'dramatic', 'surface', 'straightforward', 'suspenseful', 'adaptation', 'Bront', 'classic', 'melodrama', 'beneath', 'rapturous', 'even', 'transcendent', 'tale']",Jane Eyre [Region 2] [UK Import

You can almost watch her grow and develop as the movie goes along.  And she has one of those faces that is infinitely malleable--plain and withdrawn one moment, electric and beautiful the next, and at all times convincing.Michael Fassbender is also terrific.

He is great, ranging from sarcastic and brutal to tender and tormented in a moment.Judi Dench of course is great, even though her role (Mrs. Fairfax) is tiny.And Jamie Bell is just right as the stiff and callow (and domineering) St. John Rivers.But best of all are the settings and the writing.  The settings are gorgeous and breathtaking--particularly the outdoor ones, which are always bathed in misty, endless, shimmering colors.  And the writing!  The writer has had the good sense to stick faithfully to Charlotte Bronte's original, and lift whole passages directly.  This works beautifully.The camera work is lovely, ranging from jittery and hand-held in Jane's moments of torment to swooping and glowing in the indoor scenes to epic and stunning in the outdoor ones.Granted, there is one peculiarity.  Instead of going chronologically, as the book does, this production starts with Jane's horrifying trek across the rain-sodden and barren moors, penniless, friendless, lost, starving, just after leaving Thornfield (Rochester's house).  She nearly dies, and is rescued on the doorstep by St. John Rivers and his two sisters.  Only then are there flashbacks to explain her past--her childhood, her time with Rochester, the catastrophic wedding.This might be confusing for someone unfamiliar with the story, but it makes emotional sense.  It starts at the time of greatest emotional intensity, then goes back to explain.Even those unfamiliar will soon get it.All in all, a splendid production.",5,Beautiful.

1431104,AQR22MPF45M3P,B004X181TY,Rachel Ford,"[15, 22]","The story of Jane Eyre is well known - a poor, mistreated young woman falls for the guardian of the young girl to whom she is governess, but their romance is overshadowed by a dark secret from his past.But a more lifeless rendition of this film I could not imagine. The actress who plays Jane Eyre expresses as much emotion as an icicle - and a very bored one at that -- while the actor who plays Rochester is as lively as a long buried corpse.  It seems as if the creators of this film, in fearing to go overboard with emotions, decided the best approach was to make a film utterly devoid of it all - except at the very, very beginning.In the introduction scenes, we see crying...and whimpering...and crying...and whimpering. Then we switch to zombie mode. No one feels anything. Brocklehurst is perhaps one of the most passionate early characters, and he comes across as bored at best. Rochester and Eyre's interactions lack any spark; they are zombies reciting words in plain and flat tones. Jane Eyre's expressions rarely change. She has no kindness or warmth for Adele; indeed, one must pity the poor child who has to put up with such frigid indifference from both governess and guardian. After we meet Mrs. Fairfax, we find another character who doesn't quite look like she has passed into the spirit world yet - but only just. And Jane and Rochester continue to plod, disinterestedly, through the story, ruining every witty exchange, every moment of sadness or joy, with their languid and tepid acting.One of my ""favorite"" scenes in this horror is the ""this is my spirit addressing your spirit"" exchange. Could a blander and less interesting spirit possibly exist? Here, at least, Jane manages to tilt her eyebrows upward to indicate some emotion, though her tone remains as frigid as ever. I suppose that counts for something.Another is the ""Forgive me. I'm worthless. How could I?""  line, after Jane finds out that Rochester is already married. Imagine someone saying, ""I was going to pick up skim milk, but they were out, so I got one percent instead."" That's about the amount of emotion Rochester put into this. Maybe that's too generous. And no, I am not exaggerating. Preschoolers past their nap time could have done a better and more convincing job than these lifeless hacks.There is a perhaps five minute or so window of time when the characters seem to awaken from death in order to show a bit of liveliness, and this is the space of time between the wooden proposal and the ridiculous revelation scenes. Never fear, undead lovers: they promptly fall back into their old habits. Or, perhaps, I am too cruel to the undead. This is so lifeless, it is somewhat akin to a zombie portraying a zombie portraying a zombie...portraying a zombie.The Jane Eyre story is a great one, and the screenplay for this version isn't bad. It's the acting, though, that puts the nails in the coffin of this film's potential.

For that reason alone, I could not wait to see this movie.What makes this version different is that it is told in a series of flashbacks.  We go back and forth from Jane's early chidlhood, to her day as a governess at Mr. Rochester's home.  It is easy to understand her character, determination and strength from reflecting to some of the major events in her life that shaped her personality that is beautiful beyond her physical attributes.  If it is a beauty from inside that makes a person, Jane is absolutely adorable with her patience, steadfast devotion to her vocation and her friends and her intelligent ways of expressing herself.Film is beautiful in a way storytelling is done.

Edward Merrell, Jr. ""emerrell2""","[4, 4]","With over 25 film adaptations of the iconic Charlotte Bronte novel, it would be a near impossibility for anyone to select a favorite, much less identify the penultimate adaptation. I have personally viewed five, and it's difficult enough to select a favorite with only that limited viewing; but of these, my favorite is the 2005 Masterpiece Theatre miniseries. And that is because in order to flesh out the novel to any degree and to fully develop the characters, a miniseries format is almost a necessity. But there are some excellent theatrical adaptations too - the 1996 Franco Zeffirelli version with Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt and the 1997 Robert Young version, with Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton, come to mind; and both are superb. This one is on a par with both of them and if I had to pick a favorite, I'd select this one...they are all 5-star films though and all very highly recommended. The performance of Australian actress, Mia Wasikowski, is my primary reason for placing this one at the top of the list. Having recently re-read the novel, I'm convinced the characterization of Jane, as portrayed by the very young Wasikowski, is closer to what Bronte had in mind. The appearance of Dame Judi Dench as Mrs Fairfax is also a scale tipper; and director, Cary Fukunaga's decision to emphasize the Gothic elements of the story also elevates this adaptation in my eyes. The casting - aside from Wasikowski and Dench - is also spot-on. If you've never seen a film adaptation of &#34;Jane Eyre&#34; you won't be disappointed by queuing this one up first; but after you watch this, queue up one of the fine miniseries adaptations to gain a full appreciation of the novel...and by all means read the novel.",5,"Tagline: ""A love story as fiercely intelligent as it is passionate.""",1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,1725,"['25', 'film', 'adaptations', 'iconic', 'Charlotte', 'Bronte', 'novel', 'would', 'be', 'near', 'impossibility', 'anyone', 'select', 'favorite', 'much', 'less', 'identify', 'penultimate', 'adaptation', 'have', 'personally', 'viewed', 'five', 'difficult', 'enough', 'select', 'favorite', 'only', 'limited', 'viewing', 'favorite', '2005', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'miniseries', 'because', 'order', 'flesh', 'out', 'novel', 'degree', 'fully', 'develop', 'characters', 'miniseries', 'format', 'almost', 'necessity', 'are', 'excellent', 'theatrical', 'adaptations', 'too', '1996', 'Franco', 'Zeffirelli', 'version', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'William', 'Hurt', '1997', 'Robert', 'Young', 'version', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'come', 'mind', 'are', 'superb', 'one', 'par', 'had', 'pick', 'favorite', ""'d"", 'select', 'one', 'are', '5-star', 'films', 'very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'performance', 'Australian', 'actress', 'Mia', 'Wasikowski', 'primary', 'reason', 'placing', 'one', 'top', 'list', 'Having', 'recently', 're-read', 'novel', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'characterization', 'Jane', 'portrayed', 'very', 'young', 'Wasikowski', 'closer', 'what', 'Bronte', 'had', 'mind', 'appearance', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Mrs', 'Fairfax', 'also', 'scale', 'tipper', 'director', 'Cary', 'Fukunaga', 'decision', 'emphasize', 'Gothic', 'elements', 'story', 'also', 'adaptation', 'eyes', 'casting', 'aside', 'Wasikowski', 'Dench', 'also', 'spot-on', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'adaptation', '34', 'Jane', 'Eyre', '34', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'queuing', 'one', 'first', 'watch', 'up', 'one', 'fine', 'miniseries', 'adaptations', 'gain', 'full', 'appreciation', 'novel', 'means', 'read', 'novel']",Jane Eyre [Region 2] [UK Import

That was not in the Ruth Wilson version. I do have the book and have read it.  Why did the production companies use the same house for Mr Rochester's in both versions? That building is depressing to look at.  So to sum up, there are things to like in this one, but until I view this again and perhaps get a better perspective, I prefer Ruth Wilson's interpretation.Update. I have viewed it again. I begin to like parts of it. Poor Judi Dench. Stuck in a thankless role. Michael Fassbender makes a good Rochester. He could have been a bit more passionate. Where is the stile in either version? Jane was sitting on one in the book when she and Rochester met. Yeah I am a bit of a purist.  This version includes scenes missing from the Ruth Wilson version. Love is a strong emotion. Where is Mia Wasikowska's passion? Did the director hold her back? She still delivers her lines a little flat. Ruth Wilson was more passionate especially in the proposal scene. Therefore, I still prefer her interpretation in spite of all the problems in that movie.",3,What????,1403740800,"06 26, 2014",2014,1407,"['supposed', 'be', 'definitive', 'version', 'are', 'pluses', 'Ruth', 'Wilson', 'version', 'be', 'sure', 'actors', 'delivered', 'lines', 'were', 'reading', 'directions', 'Manchester', 'Ruth', 'Wilson', 'Toby', 'Stephens', 'spoke', 'were', 'alive', 'least', 'plus', 'showed', 'Jane', 'wandering', 'moors', 'collapsing', 'steps', 'sisters', 'house', 'was', 'not', 'Ruth', 'Wilson', 'version', 'do', 'have', 'book', 'have', 'read', 'Why', 'did', 'production', 'companies', 'use', 'same', 'house', 'Mr', 'Rochester', 'versions', 'building', 'depressing', 'look', 'So', 'sum', 'up', 'are', 'things', 'like', 'one', 'view', 'again', 'perhaps', 'get', 'better', 'perspective', 'prefer', 'Ruth', 'Wilson', 'interpretation.Update', 'have', 'viewed', 'again', 'begin', 'like', 'parts', 'Poor', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Stuck', 'thankless', 'role', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'good', 'Rochester', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'more', 'passionate', 'Where', 'stile', 'version', 'Jane', 'was', 'sitting', 'one', 'book', 'when', 'Rochester', 'met', 'Yeah', 'am', 'bit', 'purist', 'version', 'scenes', 'missing', 'Ruth', 'Wilson', 'version', 'Love', 'strong', 'emotion', 'Where', 'Mia', 'Wasikowska', 'passion', 'Did', 'director', 'hold', 'back', 'still', 'lines', 'little', 'flat', 'Ruth', 'Wilson', 'was', 'more', 'passionate', 'especially', 'proposal', 'scene', 'Therefore', 'still', 'prefer', 'interpretation', 'spite', 'problems', 'movie']",Jane Eyre [Region 2] [UK Import

Her scenes with Fassbinder are repletewith witty repartee, honesty,and understated repressed passion. There is an edge to their scenes together:""Your gaze is very direct Miss Eyre.Do you think me handsome?""-he taunts.After the opening introduction to St.John Rivers and his sisters we go back through a tale of sorry woe to her childhood.Sally Hawkins plays Jane's aunt with a Dickensian cruelty.Lowood,the charity school where she is bullied by sadistic teachers.She later becomes a teacher there.She becomes a paid subordinate in Thornfield.She first meets him by frightening his horse and he gets thrown and injured.She gets to know him through the kindly but fussy Miss Fairfax(Dench).Jane and Rochester become friends and she rescues him when fire breaks out in the house.The gothic nature of the house is highlighted by the candlelight,the oil lamps,the fire in the grate, pushing against the surrounding darkness,as well as the tales of secret people walking about,of hidden knocks, bangs,footsteps,laughter,cries.There is less light in this period movie.Jane's compelling directness and otherworldliness galvanise Rochester's jaded Byronism.The film's virtue is a straightforward sincerity,a quietness of style and mood suited to austere times.The style is neo-realism,a pared-down costuming,chilly natural light,slate-and-earth colour palette,precise cinematography,and the use of period language,intonation and dialect.There is a referencing of the spiritual and supernatural,the distancing sense of the `past as a foreign country'.Marinelli's classical score has a Romantic impulse between humanfigure and engulfing landscapes.The movement of the story is from Jane's ""poor,obscure"" selfhood and self-possession to equality with the older Rochester.We are immersed in a mythic,timeless narrative world:""I imagine things I am powerless to execute""in an ""invisible kingdom of spirits"".The darker elements of the novel,centred around Bertha Mason,her madness,the colonial Caribbean backdrop,Rochester's brooding intensity,are largely left out.Fassbinder is the

I can  can safely say - this is one of the worst. Granted Timothy Dalton's version is cheesy to an extent, but given special effects at the time.... but I digress.In a nutshell - Mia Wasikowska is terrible. Literally she spends the majority of the movie with 1 of 2 expressions on her face: apoplectic fear or menstrual cramps. I am not saying she is experiencing either, but that is what her face reads throughout the entire film. It really is quite bad and is so distracting, that you can't give any creedance to the strong and epic role of Jane Eyre. Michael Fassbender in the part of Mr. Rochester isn't bad, just not as believable in either his fierceness or his ardor as I have seen other actors do better in the role.And by the word ""film"" - I mean that the directors decided to take that approach with the story. Perhaps this was their way of recreating the wheel with a spookier environment and feeling of unease with the odd angles, limited speech, inconsistent lighting, etc. In my opinion - the story speaks for itself when well acted, you don't need to embellish or flourish with ""artsy"" interpretation. It was more distracting than enhancing.The only twinkling spark in the film is that the scene BEFORE Jane runs away was included. This is in the book and can seem anti-climactic to the tragedy of Mr. Rochester's big secret being revealed - so it's not often included in movie versions of Jane Eyre. I was happy to see this scene included in this adaptation - because it is poignant and heart wrenching. However, it was ruined quickly by Mia Wasikowska's lack of acting and facial contortions.I will neither buy or ever watch this version again.

The reviews from the critics and on Amazon had been glowing and this film was mean't to be the film adaptation to end all...Ah no. I can't say how disappointed I was with this version. Maybe the director just couldn't decide whether it should be a gothic thriller or a love story. Certainly the actors seemed to be a bit confused. There was absolutley no chemisty between Mia Wasiskowka and Michael Fassbender... They are both as cold as an artic winter and there is no reason why they suddenly develope this passion for each other other than they were trapped at Thornfield Hall and were a bit bored. Judi Dench as ususal was wonderful to watch but she couldn't save this clunker.And what happened to Mrs Rochester...she was barely a passing reflection in a window... Maybe the problem is that the length and depth of the novel is not suitable to be compressed such as this is into two hours.

I was sadly disappointed. Mia plays a somewhat repressed rather than passionate Jane Eyre and Rochester is far too young, handsome and not very convincing as the hot tempered lion tamed by true love. Adele, Bertha and Grace Poole are minimally referred to. The storyline fell flat and left out numerous important scenes and details of the making of this classic.  Gone is most of Jane's important upbringing at Lowood School. Parts like the outbreak of Typhus and Jane's strong condemnation of enforced rules were completely missing. No names of the nasty Miss Scatcherd nor her beloved friend Miss Temple whose departure of the school spurns on Jane's boredom and desire to hire herself out as a governess are mentioned.  No attempt to mention St. John and his sisters are actually her cousins and why she truly wants to share her inheritance.  The scenes of Rochester courting Blanche Ingram are left out. No gypsy readings, no parlour parties, no Jane playing the piano to show her ""schoolgirl"" talents. Pilot the dog is referred to once!  And nothing of the famous scene where Bertha Mason comes into Jane's room, wakes her, shreds her veil and disappears in the night.  Again, a very odd and sketchy version of the story of Jane Eyre. A&E did a much better job capturing all of this in a shorter amount of filming time.  BBC did a masterpiece of the film starring Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke.  The rest fall in between. Other than some lovely gothic scenes outside and eye candy shots of the interior of an old English estate, this film lacked in every other aspect.  Even after the fire Rochester looks barely harmed and the film suddenly stops.  Where is the last chapter when the famous lines come in; ""Reader, I married him.""??  Anyone new to Jane Eyre is not aware of how he regained his sight enough to see that his first child inherited his eyes.  Anyone familiar with Jane Eyre and who know the book inside out are probably cringing in their seats wondering....where is the rest of the story? Where is the full background of Bertha and how he was tricked into marrying her and what he has sacrificed?  Where is the story behind Adele and her mother?

The actors were wonderful. The movie did a great job of making you like the characters & feel their desire to be together.

My only disappointment is that we didn't see more of what Jane went through as a child. There are other areas skimmed over that I won't mention for those that aren't already familiar with the story.

My favorite by far is the 1983 BBC version starring Timothy Dalton as Mr. Rochester and Zelah Clarke as Jane Eyre. I missed the theatrical release of this recent version but managed to get the DVD and watched it a couple of days ago.Some have reviled this cinematic adaptation of Jane Eyre as not being faithful to the novel. Though it is true that this adaptation takes too many liberties with the original plot, I felt that given the constraints of movie-making and adhering to a set time limit, the movie was actually quite good. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking, and the score is suitably haunting and subdued. What made this a compelling movie to watch was the amazing performances of the two leads, i.e. Mia Wasikowska as Jane Eyre and brooding Michael Fassbender as Edward Rochester. Wasikowska plays Jane with an otherworldly ,ethereal quality that truly brought the Jane of the novel alive for me. As for Fassbender, there was just something compelling about him, and the strong chemistry between Jane Eyre and Rochester is credibly conveyed through the actions and words of the two actors.The supporting cast did a good job too - Dame Judi Dench makes for a suitably convincing Mrs. Fairfax, and Jamie Bell as the missionary St. John Rivers also did a good turn in his role.
