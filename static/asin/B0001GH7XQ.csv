Yuezhen has a crush on Zhang Shihao (Bo-lin Chen), a boy in their school, but it's Kerou who goes to talk to him on Yuezhen's behalf. Shihao thinks it's Kerou who likes him, so things become a bit of a mess when he begins to like her. At the same time, Kerou is realizing that it's Yuezhen that she's fallen in love with.It's a very innocent story of young love. Shihao becomes a good friend to Kerou too. He's the kind of boy who's very sweet and likable and a big part of making this film work. Yuezhen, on the other hand, lives in a sort of fantasy world and chooses to ignore it when Kerou kisses her. Kerou's heart breaks, but she ends up happy and more sure of herself and her sexuality, regardless of Yuezhen's reaction.Nominated for Best Asian Film at the Hong Kong Film Awards.",5,"Teenage coming out, coming of age in Taiwan",1115942400,"05 13, 2005",2005,1108,"['many', 'teenage', 'coming', 'out', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'been', 'done', 'again', 'again', 'Blue', 'Gate', 'Crossing', 'sweet', 'addition', 'kinds', 'storylines', 'added', 'interest', 'being', 'set', 'Taiwan.Meng', 'Kerou', 'Lun-mei', 'Guey', 'Lin', 'Yuezhen', 'Shu-hui', 'Liang', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'Taipei', 'Yuezhen', 'crush', 'Zhang', 'Shihao', 'Bo-lin', 'Chen', 'boy', 'school', 'Kerou', 'who', 'talk', 'Yuezhen', 'behalf', 'Shihao', 'Kerou', 'who', 'so', 'things', 'become', 'bit', 'mess', 'when', 'like', 'same', 'time', 'Kerou', 'realizing', 'fallen', 'love', 'with.It', 'very', 'innocent', 'story', 'young', 'love', 'Shihao', 'good', 'friend', 'Kerou', 'too', 'kind', 'boy', 'who', 'very', 'sweet', 'likable', 'big', 'part', 'making', 'film', 'work', 'Yuezhen', 'other', 'hand', 'sort', 'fantasy', 'world', 'chooses', 'ignore', 'when', 'Kerou', 'Kerou', 'heart', 'breaks', 'up', 'happy', 'more', 'sure', 'herself', 'sexuality', 'regardless', 'Yuezhen', 'reaction.Nominated', 'Best', 'Asian', 'Film', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'Film', 'Awards']",Blue Gate Crossing
804412,A36H16ZJXUIMZG,B0001GH7XQ,"Gene Cisco ""Moon Man""","[0, 0]","Initially, &#34;Blue Gate Crossing&#34; seemed to be almost indecipherable for me, so I continued to watch admiring the wonderful cinematography with low-budget warning lights rumbling within me. Then, more than half way through I realized what this wonderful film captured: the rarely-depicted period in adolescence lasting less than a year when their growing intellects begin to grasp the longing of their bodies. It is because the screenwriter and director capture this awkward period with such gentle handling so charmingly that I give high marks to this hardly seen film. One senses here, that they have seen the moth about to become a butterfly and both leads (Gwi Lun-Mei/Bo-lin Chen) restrain their excitement. There are a couple profound utterances within, no profanity. Catch the charm.",5,A Short Bridge,1392249600,"02 13, 2014",2014,796,"['Initially', '34', 'Blue', 'Gate', 'Crossing', '34', 'seemed', 'be', 'almost', 'indecipherable', 'so', 'continued', 'watch', 'admiring', 'wonderful', 'cinematography', 'low-budget', 'warning', 'lights', 'rumbling', 'Then', 'more', 'half', 'way', 'realized', 'what', 'wonderful', 'film', 'captured', 'rarely-depicted', 'period', 'adolescence', 'lasting', 'less', 'year', 'when', 'growing', 'intellects', 'begin', 'grasp', 'longing', 'bodies', 'screenwriter', 'director', 'capture', 'awkward', 'period', 'such', 'gentle', 'handling', 'so', 'charmingly', 'give', 'high', 'marks', 'hardly', 'seen', 'film', 'One', 'here', 'have', 'seen', 'moth', 'become', 'butterfly', 'leads', 'Gwi', 'Lun-Mei/Bo-lin', 'Chen', 'restrain', 'excitement', 'are', 'couple', 'profound', 'utterances', 'profanity', 'Catch', 'charm']",Blue Gate Crossing
804413,A1Q0QPN7BPRRI,B0001GH7XQ,Hansel,"[2, 3]","This film is so good I feel compelled to write a review.The plot is rather simple involving 2 girls and a boy: Girl A likes Boy, Boy likes Girl B and Girl B likes Girl A.What is so captivating about this film is that it is so beautifully shot that any shot you take it could be on the publicity poster.And there is a certain quiet quality to it. It has no melodrama but the honest protrayal of teenage angst and uncertainty will grip you in your chest right from the start of the film till the end. A heart-rending pain not allowing one to breathe, not intense enough to cry over but a pain so slow and insidious that it would stay within one for days before one could expunge it out.And the dialogue. There must be only about a hundred lines of exchange but every line - and many of them repeated - shows the repression of emotions, the fear if they are spoken out loud so the protagonists write on the walls, write on notebooks and burn them, write in sands to be washed by the waves.i've been watching Chinese films since I was five. I have never seen a more beautiful Chinese film before. Even Ang Lee and Zhang Yimou aren't this good.",5,"""If in the next year, or the next 3 years, you start liking boys, will you let me be the first to know?""",1158624000,"09 19, 2006",2006,1139,"['film', 'so', 'good', 'feel', 'compelled', 'write', 'review.The', 'plot', 'rather', 'simple', 'involving', '2', 'girls', 'boy', 'Girl', 'A', 'likes', 'Boy', 'Boy', 'Girl', 'B', 'Girl', 'B', 'Girl', 'A.What', 'so', 'captivating', 'film', 'so', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'shot', 'take', 'could', 'be', 'publicity', 'poster.And', 'certain', 'quiet', 'quality', 'melodrama', 'honest', 'protrayal', 'teenage', 'angst', 'uncertainty', 'will', 'grip', 'chest', 'right', 'start', 'film', 'end', 'heart-rending', 'pain', 'not', 'allowing', 'one', 'breathe', 'not', 'intense', 'enough', 'cry', 'over', 'pain', 'so', 'slow', 'insidious', 'would', 'stay', 'one', 'days', 'one', 'could', 'expunge', 'out.And', 'dialogue', 'must', 'be', 'only', 'hundred', 'lines', 'exchange', 'line', 'many', 'repeated', 'repression', 'emotions', 'fear', 'are', 'spoken', 'out', 'loud', 'so', 'protagonists', 'write', 'walls', 'write', 'notebooks', 'burn', 'write', 'sands', 'be', 'washed', 'waves.i', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'Chinese', 'films', 'was', 'five', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'more', 'beautiful', 'Chinese', 'film', 'Even', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'are', ""n't"", 'good']",Blue Gate Crossing

804415,A3NQA37KFBUSBB,B0001GH7XQ,Nomlac,"[0, 0]","In this lovely and delicate movie, a popular success in Japan, a charismatic girl loves her best friend, a lovely girl who loves a handsome boy neither of them ever talked to. The beautiful one is shy, so she asks her friend to be the go between and approach the boy, for her to meet him later. And the first girl, because she loves the other so much, being more outspoken and  much more intelligent, approaches the boy, her heart in pieces. But the boy falls in love with her. She doesn't like boys, only girls, only her girlfriend.This could be a tragedy, and in a way it is. But the director and the young actors do it in such a tender, human, funny, modern, and what more can I say?, yes, poetic way, that the filme engulfs you and you just fall in love with the three of them. It is so good when gay movies are not tragic and, more important, when the, the actors are good! This nice little film is a pleasure to see again and again and lets you into that feel good state without alienating or lying to you. Not to be missed!

804416,A3BVHPDNG36WO1,B0001GH7XQ,"Phillip Royer ""sitenoise""","[1, 1]","Dreamy, Romantic, Tender. OK We've been given those on the poster. They are not ones I would use. Instead I'd go with: Adorable, Sweet, Sensitive, Well-acted, Well-directed, Well-written. It was a joy to watch this film.It took me a few minutes to warm up to the characters, but only a few. We meet the two girls first, a girly-girl who seems to be in control, and a brooding follower. Not much to go on with that. Girly girl spots sensitive boy and wants him, but insists that brooding girl act as the go-between.The film focuses on the friendship that develops between brooding girl and sensitive boy after that. Brooding girl becomes razor-sharp, adorably mixed up commando teen when paired up with sensitive boy who has fallen in love with her.This film did a remarkable job of capturing teens as they are: insecure and passionate; as easily hurt as they are to fall in love. They provoke each other without knowing why. One of the many highlights of this film is when the boy and girl, having run out of verbal ammunition, begin a shoving match. It goes on for some time and then the director simply cuts to a scene of the two of them straightening up their surroundings together. The director makes many decisions like that to keep us focused on the big picture: stuff happens, and then something else happens. There's no stopping it.I have to point out that watching this Taiwanese film with English subtitles added quite a bit to the adorableness of it. For example, after brooding girl sets up sensitive boy with girly-girl, who knows he likes brooding girl, (you have to see the film to see how that happens), sensitive boy walks girly-girl home. After an uncomfortably done good-bye, girly-girl calls out after sensitive boy as he's about to mount his bicycle and says: ""Zhang Shihao, (pause) can you date with me?"" I don't know exactly what was said in Taiwanese, but that odd translation seemed to capture the moment perfectly.I smiled from ear to ear while watching this movie from the time sensitive boy was introduced until the very end. This is an exceptionally well done film, off-the-charts-delightful.",5,One of the most delightful films I've seen.
