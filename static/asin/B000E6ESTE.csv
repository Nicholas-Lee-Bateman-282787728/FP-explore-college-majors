969853,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000E6ESTE,A Customer,"[2, 3]","Susan Sarandon must have been on holidays in Melbourne when she agreed to star in this psychological thriller, as it seems a bit unrealistic to think she travelled all the way ""down under"" to make this rather average film. Irresistible does have some good moments, and a times it's undeniably compelling, but it takes a while to get started and the eventual dramatic payoff comes across as a bit anemic.Lies, family secrets and obsession lie at the center of Irresistible. Sophie Hartley lives an idyllic life in a picaresque Melbourne suburb. She's a successful book illustrator, she is married to Craig (Sam Neil), a loving and caring architect and they have two lovely children. But lately Sophie has been plagued with nightmares and even the slightest noise causes her to break out in a type of nervous fear.A book deadline is fast approaching and Sophie is terrified of failure. She's still getting over the death of her beloved mother and she's having problems focusing on her work. To make matters worse, things aren't going well with Craig. Sophie becomes convinced that she's being stalked by one of Craig's co-workers - a beautiful, highly competent assistant, Mara Toufiey (Emily Blunt).Unfortunately, no one believes her. Yet she's adamant that Mara is watching, following, and coping her. Things go missing in the house - her daughters' toys, family photographs, even her favourite dress. She even attacked by wasps one afternoon, while working in her studio.  Gradually Sophie's life begins to spiral out of control, her eldest daughter turns against her and Craig is at a loss to help her.She becomes increasingly consumed with paranoia convinced Mara is trying to steal her husband, her daughters, and her life. She trespasses in Mara's house in an effort to find some clue as to why Mara may be stalking her, but she's caught and Mara takes out a court order against her.  Soon she finds herself in danger of losing custody of her children.Is Sophie imagining everything? Is Craig having an affair with Mara? Are Craig and Mara both trying to drive Sophie crazy? The final outcome isn't that much of a surprise providing the viewer pays attention and notes a pivotal scene that takes place between Sophie and her father (Charles Tingwell). But you really have to suspend disbelief with this movie - when the dreaded secret is revealed and a certain character's true motivations are exposed, the movie takes a turn for the silly.It puzzles me why this movie is not getting a theatrical release in the United States, as it's much better than some of the local trash that Hollywood churn out. The performances are pretty good with Ms. Sarandon doing an exceptional job of playing a woman who is gradually unraveling, and Emily Blunt is also a standout as an enigmatic girl with a shady past.  And for those who get bored with the story, there are always the views of Melbourne to admire - it really is one of Australia's most beautiful cities.

969857,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000E6ESTE,Grady Harp,"[18, 19]","IRRESISTIBLE is a little film from Australia with big ideas and a clumsy script.  The story itself is good with enough variation from the usual thriller scripts to make it enjoyable, but the writing borders on improvisation and doesn't provide the motivation for the development of the story to flow smoothly enough to maintain the credibility of the characters.Set in contemporary Melbourne, Australia, the story begins in media res with our heroine Sophie (Susan Sarandon), a successful illustrator, wife of an equally important architect (Sam Neill), and mother to two little girls, hearing noises and finding odd incidents.  Recovering from the death of her beloved mother and caring for her grieving father (Charles 'Bud' Tingwell), Sophie's stress factor is further heightened by the fact that she has a block about the illustrations for a book whose deadline is nearing.  Her husband is supportive and encourages her to get away from her problems by attending a party given by a new associate of his at the firm - the bright and beautiful Mara (Emily Blunt) - who just happens to be wearing the same new dress Sophie has purchased for the party.  The two meet, dance together, drink together, but innuendoes have started: party guests offer condolences for her mothers death but also suggest she join AA for her 'drinking problem'.Sophie's mind continues to fragment as she imagines she is being stalked by Mara because of events that happen in her house, with her wardrobe, and with paranoia that her husband and Mara are having an affair.  She decides to observe Mara closely, discovering facts that feed her paranoia, and is caught in Mara's house - and arrested.  From there the story disintegrates into revelation of facts that border on melodrama with ill-defined motivations marring every scene. To reveal the ultimate nidus for the story's plot would rob the viewer of what little surprises there are here.Ann Turner could have used a script doctor before shooting this film, as the story is fine: it is just clumsy and not finessed. But once again Susan Sarandon proves she is such a fine actress that she can pull off even a spotty script and create a credible character.  Sam Neill and Emily Blunt likewise do the best with what they are given with lines and direction.  This is not a bad movie at all, just one that needed a bit of surgery before placing it on the screen,  and the film is well worth watching for Sarandon fans.  She still is one of our finest actresses on the screen today.

Credit the writers for coming up with a clever twist as to Blunt's true identity.Sarandon doesn't give one of her best performances, but she's a pro and makes the most of her role, while Neill plays the suffering husband adequately.Overall, I found it entertaining.",3,STRANGE LITTLE THRILLER,1147305600,"05 11, 2006",2006,676,"['IRRESISTIBLE', 'strange', 'little', 'thriller', 'filmed', 'Australia', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'leading', 'roles', 'sometimes', 'clever', 'sometimes', 'implausible', 'script', 'finds', 'Neill', 'new', 'assistant', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'seductive', 'performance', 'trying', 'take', 'over', 'Sarandon', 'life', 'Neill', 'process.Starting', 'minor', 'things', 'taking', 'dresses', 'pictures', 'etc.', 'more', 'dangerous', 'threat', 'Credit', 'writers', 'coming', 'up', 'clever', 'twist', 'Blunt', 'true', 'identity.Sarandon', ""n't"", 'give', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'pro', 'most', 'role', 'Neill', 'suffering', 'husband', 'adequately.Overall', 'found', 'entertaining']",Irresistible

This is so excruciatingly bad, even painful, to watch that I could barely watch it to the end.Take a beautiful, accomplished if somewhat ditzy older woman, throw in a mid-life marriage crisis, and a mysterious younger beauty.  Add fear and possible insanity, titillation, and some haphazard explanations thrown in that don't fit with the plot, and you have a disaster of incoherence, eventually leading to violence and wholly unbelievable pseudo-resolution.  But at least the actors were fine.  OK, the ending does add a nice twist.  So 2 stars instead of one.Alas, this film simply doesn't work.

Susan Sarandon is terrific portraying a temperamental artist who is also a stay at home mom who is troubled by strange happenings in her home.  Sam Neill portrays her emotionally supportive and loving husband who is perplexed by her strange mood swings pertaining to her suspicions.  Emily Blunt really steals the show as husband Neill's information technologist right hand at work who also plays a large part in the mysterious happenings that abound in the film.I recommend this film very highly.

""Irresistible"" is misleading. The descriptive blurb on the DVD cover is similarly misleading. Contrary to what these summaries imply, it's immediately apparent that this movie isn't simply about the possibility that some crazed ex-boyfriend is stalking a woman. We realize that something more complex is going on here. The tension starts to build almost from the opening scenes as Susan Sarandon begins to get the uneasy feeling that someone is in her house, that someone is in fact invading her house on a regular basis, stealing small items, leaving deadly little twists as tokens of having been there.Is she imagining this? Have the pressures of her work as book illustrator, with deadlines to meet and repressed memories to dredge up - started to unbalance her?The viewer is kept guessing. Along the way though, we are taken into the life of a truly decent mother and wife. For once, it is heartening to keep company with a featured mother. She is fun and a true friend to her children and husband, without abdicating her role as responsible adult.This is a well-written movie, done in the classic tradition of mystery/thrillers. All the loose ends get tied up and whatever twists there are along the way play fair with the audience. And as ever, Susan Sarandon has a compelling screen presence.
