The film definitely doesn't acknowledge the viewer's intelligence: shouldn't we consider the historical context of what it would mean for these two people to have a relationship at that time in the South?  I thought Ms. Givens was poorly directed (her character's range amounted to two signature facial expressions, one I'd describe as a sexy sneer). She plays the role very 90's and is not believable as a woman from the South of the 1950s.It's not that all of the acting is bad, and there are some moments, but wouldn't you rather see a good film? On the positive side, I can tell you that this film gave me one of the best hysterical laughing fits I have had in years. For that much I'm grateful.",1,"run, don't walk away from this film",1003190400,"10 16, 2001",2001,1363,"['am', 'confessing', 'watched', 'film', 'am', 'writing', 'review', 'more', 'public', 'service', 'announcement.', 'quot', 'Foreign', 'Student', 'quot', 'out', 'promisingly', 'enough', 'French', 'exchange', 'student', 'American', 'South', 'segregation', 'transformed', 'world', 'so', 'one', 'left', 'implausible', 'film', 'most', 'importantly', 'grand', 'canyon', 'jump', ""n't"", 'explain', 'how', 'hero', 'initial', 'schoolboy', 'crush', 'suddenly', 'hot', 'physical', 'affair', 'attractive', 'young', 'black', 'teacher/domestic', 'Robin', 'Givens', 'very', 'Zalman', 'King/', 'quot', 'Red', 'Shoe', 'Diaries', 'quot', 'vibe', 'film', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'acknowledge', 'viewer', 'intelligence', 'should', ""n't"", 'consider', 'historical', 'context', 'what', 'would', 'mean', 'two', 'people', 'have', 'relationship', 'time', 'South', 'thought', 'Ms.', 'Givens', 'was', 'poorly', 'directed', 'character', 'range', 'amounted', 'two', 'signature', 'facial', 'expressions', 'one', ""'d"", 'describe', 'sexy', 'sneer', 'role', 'very', '90', 'not', 'believable', 'woman', 'South', '1950s.It', 'not', 'acting', 'bad', 'are', 'moments', 'would', ""n't"", 'rather', 'see', 'good', 'film', 'positive', 'side', 'can', 'tell', 'film', 'gave', 'one', 'best', 'hysterical', 'laughing', 'fits', 'have', 'had', 'years', 'much', ""'m"", 'grateful']",Foreign Student VHS

368141,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,6303294103,Martin Asiner,"[18, 18]","In most romance movies, the viewer can pretty well predict early on whether the lovers will wind up together. There is something about the opening tone, usually set by music, shades of color, locale, or brief introductions to the lovers, that foreshadows their future. In FOREIGN STUDENT, the red light of failure flashes right away and stays flashing right to the credits. Marco Hofschneider plays a sweet French student studying in the south United States in the 1950s. He meets a lovely Robin Givens, who radiates a smoldering passion that Marco flits toward. The problem is that in the south of that time, interracial relationships were doomed from the start, yet the lovers try. Each seems to feel that in another place and another time, they could succeed, but in the here and the now, they can only invite disaster. Of the two, Marco is the more emotional one, the lover who sees only the object of his desire and not the formidable obstacles to its fruition. Givens is the one who has her feet planted firmly is the sociological soil of her time. She cannot be faulted for beginning the affair--after all Marco is the perfect dream man: handsome, cultured, athletic, and speaks French into the bargain. But she has enough sense to hear alarm bells go off inside, and she breaks off the relation.The first time I saw this film, it seemed a trite piece of soap-opera fluffery, designed more for the female who longs for more in a lover than the clods she is used to. But repeated viewings indicate that love and attraction can occur even in a racially and culturally divergent set of lovers, and if society squashes that love, then the pain that they feel can be felt by the viewer too. Any movie that can do this cannot be so easily dismissed as fluffery. Many love stories try to involve the viewer; FOREIGN STUDENT is one of the few that succeed.",3,Foreign Student: A Stacked Deck,1025308800,"06 29, 2002",2002,1855,"['most', 'romance', 'movies', 'viewer', 'can', 'pretty', 'well', 'predict', 'early', 'lovers', 'will', 'wind', 'up', 'together', 'something', 'opening', 'tone', 'usually', 'set', 'music', 'shades', 'color', 'locale', 'brief', 'introductions', 'lovers', 'future', 'FOREIGN', 'STUDENT', 'red', 'light', 'failure', 'flashes', 'right', 'away', 'flashing', 'right', 'credits', 'Marco', 'Hofschneider', 'sweet', 'French', 'student', 'studying', 'south', 'United', 'States', '1950s', 'lovely', 'Robin', 'Givens', 'who', 'smoldering', 'passion', 'Marco', 'problem', 'south', 'time', 'interracial', 'relationships', 'were', 'doomed', 'start', 'yet', 'lovers', 'try', 'feel', 'place', 'time', 'could', 'succeed', 'here', 'now', 'can', 'only', 'invite', 'disaster', 'two', 'Marco', 'more', 'emotional', 'one', 'lover', 'who', 'only', 'object', 'desire', 'not', 'formidable', 'obstacles', 'fruition', 'Givens', 'one', 'who', 'feet', 'planted', 'firmly', 'sociological', 'soil', 'time', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'faulted', 'beginning', 'affair', 'Marco', 'perfect', 'dream', 'man', 'handsome', 'cultured', 'athletic', 'French', 'bargain', 'enough', 'sense', 'hear', 'alarm', 'bells', 'go', 'inside', 'relation.The', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'film', 'seemed', 'trite', 'piece', 'soap-opera', 'fluffery', 'designed', 'more', 'female', 'who', 'more', 'lover', 'clods', 'used', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'indicate', 'love', 'attraction', 'can', 'occur', 'even', 'racially', 'culturally', 'divergent', 'set', 'lovers', 'society', 'squashes', 'love', 'then', 'pain', 'feel', 'can', 'be', 'felt', 'viewer', 'too', 'Any', 'movie', 'can', 'do', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'easily', 'dismissed', 'fluffery', 'Many', 'love', 'stories', 'try', 'involve', 'viewer', 'FOREIGN', 'STUDENT', 'one', 'few', 'succeed']",Foreign Student VHS
