I gave this DVD as a gift but have these episodes on dvd and vhs too.  So, as far as content, if you like the honeymooners or like classic tv, you will love these episodes.  Heart warming, funny and safe for the whole family to watch.  I miss timeless classics like these.  This is when comedy was clean, fun and inventive.  The writers were creative and didn't need sexual innuendo to try and get a laugh.  These episodes are a staple for our household to watch every christmas or just when we want to laugh or have the Christmas feeling.",5,Classic Comedy at it's finest,1297814400,"02 16, 2011",2011,626,"['love', 'Honeymooners', 'have', 'black', 'white', 'episodes', 'dvd', 'vhs', 'tape', 'gave', 'DVD', 'gift', 'have', 'episodes', 'dvd', 'vhs', 'too', 'So', 'as', 'far', 'content', 'like', 'honeymooners', 'classic', 'tv', 'will', 'love', 'episodes', 'Heart', 'warming', 'funny', 'safe', 'whole', 'family', 'watch', 'miss', 'timeless', 'classics', 'when', 'comedy', 'was', 'clean', 'fun', 'inventive', 'writers', 'were', 'creative', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'try', 'get', 'laugh', 'episodes', 'are', 'staple', 'household', 'watch', 'christmas', 'just', 'when', 'want', 'laugh', 'have', 'Christmas', 'feeling']",The Honeymooners - Holiday Classics

Jackie Gleason portrays several of his characters in the Christmas Eve first show.  Reginald VanGleason is the best, we crack up everytime we watch it.  Also, the Poor Soul who has nothing, the Beer Delivery man who goes to the wrong apartment. Too much fun definitely want to see this one.  Plus the DVD had bonus shows we never saw before with Jimmy & Tommy Dorsey performing.",5,Jackie Gleason - Honeymooners Holiday Special,1357084800,"01 2, 2013",2013,488,"['owned', 'VHS', 'wanted', 'have', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'classic', 'watch', 'Christmas', 'Jackie', 'Gleason', 'several', 'characters', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'first', 'show', 'Reginald', 'VanGleason', 'best', 'crack', 'up', 'everytime', 'watch', 'Also', 'Poor', 'Soul', 'who', 'nothing', 'Beer', 'Delivery', 'man', 'who', 'wrong', 'apartment', 'Too', 'much', 'fun', 'definitely', 'want', 'see', 'one', 'DVD', 'had', 'bonus', 'shows', 'never', 'saw', 'Jimmy', 'Tommy', 'Dorsey', 'performing']",The Honeymooners - Holiday Classics

713134,A1NAWURECL4TRD,B00006FDB1,"Tara ""Libby""","[0, 7]",What was funny many years ago is not funny anymore. The Honeymooners had been my favorite TV show for years but I found it silly and boring as did my husband. It mainly centered about Jackie Gleason playing all the characters he was famous for- all in one episode. Even Art Carney wasn't funny. There are several other episodes on the DVD but I doubt if we will watch them and it will probably be donated to the public library. We were all ready for a good laugh but when the laughs came they were almost forced.,2,Disappointing,1293408000,"12 27, 2010",2010,512,"['What', 'was', 'funny', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'not', 'funny', 'anymore', 'Honeymooners', 'had', 'been', 'favorite', 'TV', 'show', 'years', 'found', 'silly', 'boring', 'did', 'husband', 'mainly', 'centered', 'Jackie', 'Gleason', 'playing', 'characters', 'was', 'famous', 'for-', 'one', 'episode', 'Even', 'Art', 'Carney', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'doubt', 'will', 'watch', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'donated', 'public', 'library', 'were', 'ready', 'good', 'laugh', 'when', 'laughs', 'came', 'were', 'almost', 'forced']",The Honeymooners - Holiday Classics
