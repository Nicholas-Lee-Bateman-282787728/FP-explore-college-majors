She was a women disguised as a man, taking her ailing father's place in the Chinese army fighting the invasion of the Mongols.  Her courage caused her to rise to the rank of General.  But after the slaughter of many of her men, and the supposed death of the man she loved, she lost her will to lead in battle.  The story become more poignant as she tries one last effort to save her men.  A very interesting movie.Also of interest was the acting of Jackie Chan's son in the film.

1335090,AXOO7BPM22BDO,B003ATD7OO,"John Green ""Darkwriter""","[2, 2]","Hua Mulan, the latest take on the Mulan legend, finally gives the subject the treatment it deserves.  It's a gritty, stark film that chronicles the well known story of a woman who defies both convention and the law by disguising herself as a man to fight in the campaign against the Rouran Confederation, an earlier version of the classic Mongolian raiders.Not much is known about the Mulan fable other than the basics.  Here it opens in the Rouran camp as Mendu (Hu Jun), son of the Danyou- leader of the tribes- is executing prisoners instead of releasing them as his father wished.  The looming presence of the Rouran forces a nationwide conscription to repel the invaders.  Already a veteran, Mulan's ailing father is called to serve again, but she steals his armor and sword and reports in his place.  She meets new comrades as well as reuniting with a friend from her village, Tiger (Jaycee Chan), who agrees to help her.  She also befriends Wentai (Chen Kun) a lieutenant in their unit who also uncovers her secret but agrees to maintain the deception, seeing no real value in outing her.  When the Rourans invade their camp Mulan distinguishes herself; with the commander killed in the battle she and Wentai earn promotions.  They achieve an impressive record, fueling some jealousy among their superiors.  As the war continues and many of her friends fall, Mulan tires of it all and admits her feelings for Wentai, who though he feels the same, is forced to teach her some severe lessons about what it means be in command as well as the dangers of having personal attachments during war.  In response to Mulan's string of victories Mendu seizes control of the Rouran tribes from his father and pushes north.  A war council forms a plan to bait the Rouran into a canyon to destroy them and Mulan volunteers to draw them in. This confrontation leads to developments that will affect the course of the war and change the lives of the survivors in unforeseen ways, even as it draws their destinies together.The strongest part of the movie is script.  It's engaging with lots of little touches, rooted in themes of love, honor, loyalty and patriotism- starting with her father's desire to serve beyond his capabilities and the love and respect for him that drives Mulan.  Even the idea that a woman could serve in the military for twelve years, rising to the rank of a senior commanding officer and no one noticing anything gets a little of this treatment.  You get the impression the troops know but she's long since earned their respect and admiration.  The most sentimental moments are a recurring ideal of the stars as spirits looking down upon their loved ones.  Unfortunately all the good stuff is saved for Mulan and the fellas; the Rouran characters are all second-stringers, though Mendu has a couple of good lines.Zhao Wei as Mulan demands your attention and not because she's the star of the movie.  She has a great dramatic presence and portrays Mulan's personal struggles and conflicts with conviction through her expressions and small gestures- in short, good acting.  From the horror of her first kill to wondering about the reasons why they fight, Mulan is a person questioning herself and searching for answers... and like anyone else doesn't always receive them well.  Her best scene comes when a soldier's jade pendant goes missing and his uncle, the commander, orders everyone strip-searched to find it.  The tension plays out well and as she's forced to make a decision her eyes and facial expressions say it all.  Many of the more dramatic scenes evolve this way, and no one in the cast is ashamed to shed a few tears to show how much they care.  Jaycee Chan- Jackie's son- is a standout in his supporting role, with some truly poignant moments in the desert sequence.Another strength of the film lies in its production.  The cinematography plays up the contrast between the slight dullness of the colors in military life to the crisper tones and gleaming trinkets under the high sun for the Rouran nomads as well as the bleakness of the desert before and after a devastating sandstorm.  Like all sweeping dramas the pacing gets a little slow sometimes, but the editing is excellent.  Fadeout transitions occur at just the right moments and like with all well-told stories, you understand what's happening without having it all spelled out for you- something Hollywood studios should keep in mind.  Though the film sort of rushes through its final scenes, you won't feel too cheated by it.  Even the soundtrack works- it's evocative, moody and boosts the melodrama even higher.Hua Mulan is a well-crafted, well-acted film that's absolutely worthy of your time and attention.  And being so reasonably priced on dvd and blu-ray there's no reason not to give it.",4,China Reclaims Its Legend,1299369600,"03 6, 2011",2011,4785,"['Hua', 'Mulan', 'latest', 'take', 'Mulan', 'legend', 'finally', 'subject', 'treatment', 'gritty', 'stark', 'film', 'well', 'known', 'story', 'woman', 'who', 'convention', 'law', 'disguising', 'man', 'fight', 'campaign', 'Rouran', 'Confederation', 'earlier', 'version', 'classic', 'Mongolian', 'raiders.Not', 'much', 'known', 'Mulan', 'other', 'basics', 'Here', 'Rouran', 'camp', 'Mendu', 'Hu', 'Jun', 'son', 'Danyou-', 'leader', 'tribes-', 'executing', 'prisoners', 'instead', 'releasing', 'father', 'wished', 'looming', 'presence', 'Rouran', 'forces', 'nationwide', 'conscription', 'repel', 'invaders', 'Already', 'veteran', 'Mulan', 'ailing', 'father', 'called', 'serve', 'again', 'armor', 'sword', 'reports', 'place', 'new', 'comrades', 'as', 'well', 'reuniting', 'friend', 'village', 'Tiger', 'Jaycee', 'Chan', 'who', 'help', 'also', 'Wentai', 'Chen', 'Kun', 'lieutenant', 'unit', 'who', 'also', 'secret', 'maintain', 'deception', 'seeing', 'real', 'value', 'outing', 'When', 'Rourans', 'invade', 'camp', 'Mulan', 'commander', 'killed', 'battle', 'Wentai', 'earn', 'promotions', 'achieve', 'impressive', 'record', 'fueling', 'jealousy', 'superiors', 'war', 'many', 'friends', 'fall', 'Mulan', 'feelings', 'Wentai', 'who', 'same', 'forced', 'teach', 'severe', 'lessons', 'what', 'be', 'command', 'as', 'well', 'dangers', 'having', 'personal', 'attachments', 'war', 'response', 'Mulan', 'string', 'victories', 'Mendu', 'control', 'Rouran', 'tribes', 'father', 'pushes', 'north', 'A', 'war', 'council', 'plan', 'bait', 'Rouran', 'canyon', 'destroy', 'Mulan', 'volunteers', 'draw', 'confrontation', 'developments', 'will', 'affect', 'course', 'war', 'change', 'lives', 'survivors', 'unforeseen', 'ways', 'even', 'destinies', 'together.The', 'strongest', 'part', 'movie', 'script', 'engaging', 'lots', 'little', 'touches', 'rooted', 'themes', 'love', 'honor', 'loyalty', 'patriotism-', 'starting', 'father', 'desire', 'serve', 'capabilities', 'love', 'respect', 'Mulan', 'Even', 'idea', 'woman', 'could', 'serve', 'military', 'twelve', 'years', 'rising', 'rank', 'senior', 'commanding', 'officer', 'one', 'noticing', 'anything', 'little', 'treatment', 'get', 'impression', 'troops', 'know', 'long', 'earned', 'respect', 'admiration', 'most', 'sentimental', 'moments', 'are', 'recurring', 'ideal', 'stars', 'spirits', 'looking', 'down', 'loved', 'ones', 'Unfortunately', 'good', 'stuff', 'saved', 'Mulan', 'fellas', 'Rouran', 'characters', 'are', 'second-stringers', 'Mendu', 'couple', 'good', 'lines.Zhao', 'Wei', 'Mulan', 'attention', 'not', 'star', 'movie', 'great', 'dramatic', 'presence', 'Mulan', 'personal', 'struggles', 'conflicts', 'conviction', 'expressions', 'small', 'gestures-', 'short', 'good', 'acting', 'horror', 'first', 'kill', 'wondering', 'reasons', 'why', 'fight', 'Mulan', 'person', 'questioning', 'searching', 'answers', 'anyone', 'else', ""n't"", 'always', 'receive', 'well', 'best', 'scene', 'when', 'soldier', 'jade', 'pendant', 'missing', 'uncle', 'commander', 'orders', 'everyone', 'strip-searched', 'find', 'tension', 'out', 'well', 'forced', 'make', 'decision', 'eyes', 'facial', 'expressions', 'say', 'Many', 'more', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'evolve', 'way', 'one', 'cast', 'ashamed', 'shed', 'few', 'tears', 'show', 'how', 'much', 'care', 'Jaycee', 'Chan-', 'Jackie', 'son-', 'standout', 'supporting', 'role', 'truly', 'poignant', 'moments', 'desert', 'sequence.Another', 'strength', 'film', 'production', 'cinematography', 'up', 'contrast', 'slight', 'dullness', 'colors', 'military', 'life', 'crisper', 'tones', 'gleaming', 'trinkets', 'high', 'sun', 'Rouran', 'nomads', 'as', 'well', 'bleakness', 'desert', 'devastating', 'sandstorm', 'sweeping', 'pacing', 'little', 'slow', 'sometimes', 'editing', 'excellent', 'transitions', 'occur', 'just', 'right', 'moments', 'well-told', 'stories', 'understand', 'what', 'happening', 'having', 'spelled', 'out', 'you-', 'something', 'Hollywood', 'studios', 'should', 'keep', 'mind', 'film', 'sort', 'rushes', 'final', 'scenes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'too', 'cheated', 'Even', 'soundtrack', 'works-', 'evocative', 'moody', 'melodrama', 'even', 'higher.Hua', 'Mulan', 'well-crafted', 'well-acted', 'film', 'absolutely', 'worthy', 'time', 'attention', 'being', 'so', 'reasonably', 'priced', 'dvd', 'blu-ray', 'reason', 'not', 'give']",N/A

1335099,A3JQ58CZBV3FOZ,B003ATD7OO,M. Wang,"[9, 9]","The story of this movie is set in 5th century AD China, the Northern Wei dynasty. China had previously entered a dark age in the 3rd century, losing 85-90% of its population in years of civil wars. After a brief reunification under the Jin dynasty, the empire collapsed again, this time completely. All sorts of barbarians from the northern steppe and the western highland invaded China proper and set up their own little kingdoms. The remainder of the old imperial forces retreated to the southern bank of Yanzi River. Thus began a period known as the South/North Dynasties. Eventually, one northern kingdom conquered all the others. This was the Northern Wei. Although the Wei aristocracy originally came from modern-day Mongolia, it quickly sinicized and adopted the Chinese culture, language and clothing. Its sister tribe, the Avars, however, stayed behind and dominated the steppe.Mulan is a true figure from the Wei period, and I am glad to see that this movie respects the historical facts. The Wei adopted Chinese agricultural economy but kept its old militant administrative structure, dividing the population into farmer vs soldier households. Mulan was born into one of the latter. As a single child, she was the only one in her family able to answer military service calls in her father's place. After Wei and the Avars consolidated their respective territories, they came into direct and continuous conflict for the next hundred years. It was under this background that Mulan entered the military and later the history book.History does not provide much details, however, on the 12 years of her service, and this movie fills in the blanks. The battle scenes are frequent and nicely staged. The fighting and costumes are reasonably realistic. Much melodrama was introduced with a love interest for Mulan. I am too old to enjoy this part, but perhaps other viewers will like it better.Overall, a decent production. I particularly like all the historically inspired details, including a political marriage that led to a ceasefire between Wei and Avars. I hope you will enjoy it too.",4,Great battle scenes interspersed with melodrama.,1382486400,"10 23, 2013",2013,2093,"['story', 'movie', 'set', '5th', 'century', 'AD', 'China', 'Northern', 'Wei', 'dynasty', 'China', 'had', 'previously', 'entered', 'dark', 'age', '3rd', 'century', 'losing', '85-90', '%', 'population', 'years', 'civil', 'wars', 'brief', 'reunification', 'Jin', 'dynasty', 'empire', 'collapsed', 'again', 'time', 'completely', 'sorts', 'barbarians', 'northern', 'steppe', 'western', 'highland', 'invaded', 'China', 'proper', 'set', 'up', 'own', 'little', 'kingdoms', 'remainder', 'old', 'imperial', 'forces', 'retreated', 'southern', 'bank', 'Yanzi', 'River', 'Thus', 'began', 'period', 'known', 'South/North', 'Dynasties', 'Eventually', 'one', 'northern', 'kingdom', 'conquered', 'others', 'was', 'Northern', 'Wei', 'Wei', 'aristocracy', 'originally', 'came', 'modern-day', 'Mongolia', 'quickly', 'sinicized', 'adopted', 'Chinese', 'culture', 'language', 'clothing', 'sister', 'tribe', 'Avars', 'however', 'stayed', 'dominated', 'steppe.Mulan', 'true', 'figure', 'Wei', 'period', 'am', 'glad', 'see', 'movie', 'historical', 'facts', 'Wei', 'adopted', 'Chinese', 'agricultural', 'economy', 'kept', 'old', 'militant', 'administrative', 'structure', 'dividing', 'population', 'farmer', 'vs', 'soldier', 'households', 'Mulan', 'was', 'born', 'one', 'latter', 'single', 'child', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'family', 'able', 'answer', 'military', 'service', 'calls', 'father', 'place', 'Wei', 'Avars', 'consolidated', 'respective', 'territories', 'came', 'direct', 'continuous', 'conflict', 'next', 'hundred', 'years', 'was', 'background', 'Mulan', 'entered', 'military', 'later', 'history', 'book.History', 'not', 'provide', 'much', 'details', 'however', '12', 'years', 'service', 'movie', 'blanks', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'frequent', 'nicely', 'staged', 'fighting', 'costumes', 'are', 'reasonably', 'realistic', 'Much', 'melodrama', 'was', 'introduced', 'love', 'interest', 'Mulan', 'am', 'too', 'old', 'enjoy', 'part', 'perhaps', 'other', 'viewers', 'will', 'like', 'better.Overall', 'decent', 'production', 'particularly', 'historically', 'inspired', 'details', 'including', 'political', 'marriage', 'led', 'ceasefire', 'Wei', 'Avars', 'hope', 'will', 'enjoy', 'too']",N/A

1335102,A238W7T3KJAKQH,B003ATD7OO,shaun brammer,"[7, 11]","Do you remember Disney's forgotten princess? Which one? There have been a few I suppose. I am talking about Mulan, the princess who could fight. Do you remember her? I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't, for Disney has. I knew I couldn't avoid Disney with two daughters, so I tired to steer them towards the better examples the corporate giant has produced. I deemed Mulan one of these, but we always had trouble finding Mulan toys, clothes, or other things. In the end, like every other America girl, they liked the blonde, white princesses. However, they have gotten older and one of them is learning Karate, so when Mulan: Rise of a Warrior came out I was excited that I might be able to give them an example of a woman warrior more real to life then the Disney version. I was wrong.If you have see the animated Mulan then you have the gist of the tale. Young girl wants to save her father from military service so she steals his gear and disguises herself as a man and enlists. She serves with honor, gains recognition, becomes a hero and so forth. This version differs somewhat in some small things. For one, Hua Mulan, played by Zhao Wei, has a friend from her village who knows her secret, Tiger, played by Jaycee Chan. Jaycee is Jackie Chan's son and he is proving to be a better actor then his father. Shortly after getting settled into the army's camp, Mulan is discovered by a commanding officer, Wentai, played by Chen Kun. They quickly develop feelings for each other. Between the two of them they support Mulan and help her advance in rank throughout her career. A career spent fighting the Rouran peoples who are trying to invade the Northern Wei Kingdom.This film could've been big. It could've been moving and educational and perhaps enlightening. However, I fear that Mulan doesn't hold as much cultural value as Confucius does, so the people behind this film didn't take the time or put in the work they should've to make this the success it could've been. I wonder if Mulan being a woman had anything to do with that? The film moved too fast, some scenes were only a handful of seconds, some under ten. It takes you through her early career and friendships with such speed you don't learn anything about these people. The only proof that they are important to Mulan is how she reacts when they die. So, when the film shows them dying dramatically and Mulan profoundly effected, you just can't believe it. There is no bridge for the gap between their introduction and death. You are not given a reason to care about any of these people, not even those closest to her, like Tiger and Wentai. The film does slow down by the end and provides what would be a great ending if the beginning was to have matched it. However, the ending is hallow considering the loose plot it was built upon.Despite the choppy, poorly written script the actors do a fair job. Zhao Wei does well with her emotional scenes of loss. Even if there is no connection established for the viewer to become emotional invested, you can still praise Zhao. She also does well with the action, which shouldn't surprise anyone, considering her past films. The large battle scenes are one of the few highlights, if you are an optimist. However, as a viewer, the same lack of emotional establishment exists for these scenes as the scenes of lost friends and love scenes. So, they would be great battle scenes if you were given a reason to care.The enemies are not as impressive as Disney's Shan Yu is, but they are more accurate. The Rouran are one in a long line of nomadic horse cultures that raided into southern China and were always fought off or bribed off. Most of the movie looks to be filmed somewhere along the Hexi Corridor, a thin bit of land which historical connected China to the Silk Road. Chinese rulers had to fight for control over that piece of land many times, as well as keep invaders from using it. Jun Hu plays the main villain, Modu. Normally a good actor, his performance in this film was a let down. I don't blame him, after all, he only had so much to work with.I am also upset with how Mulan is portrayed. She is never made to seem that strong. Sure, she kicks and punches and kills, but won't look people in the eye, cries a lot, and is never sure of herself. Unless, of course, Tiger or Wentai is there to comfort and advise her. For a young woman who runs off to join the military knowing if she is discovered she will be killed, raped or worse, she would've been a hell of a lot more self-confident, or at least more brazen. She would have more steel in her own will and not find it in her male friends so often. I am not suggesting that she can't have friends, but really, Mulan couldn't have been that weak willed as she is portrayed here.In all I found this movie lacking in so many aspects. They failed to make a connection worthy of being emotional over. They failed to pace the film. They clouded a good story with battle scenes that looked more like a chance for the Theatrical Division of the PLA to play dress up. They squandered the talents of many good artists on a script which shouldn't have even been considered as a first draft. They lost an opportunity to tell an amazing story of an amazing woman, raising the bar on how the world views women in general as well as in history. This film is a bitter disappoint. In conclusion, I am not saying Disney's Mulan is better, I am saying both versions aren't worth much. We will all have to wait to have the story of Hua Mulan told with patience and respect.",2,This Could've Been Big,1380326400,"09 28, 2013",2013,5530,"['Do', 'remember', 'Disney', 'forgotten',

Basically, it's a film about the sacrifices made during times of brutal war, of filial devotion and the tragedy of unfulfilled love.I've seen more than a few reviews complaining about the English dubbing however I would like to point out a couple things: one, the title of this streaming video page clearly displays the version in the title and second, this is one of the most flawless and least distracting examples of live-action English dubbing of foreign cinema I've seen (they did an excellent job).  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie however I will admit the greatest barrier to fully engaging my willing suspension of disbelief was how anyone could mistake the ridiculously cute Vicki Zhao (""Red Cliff"", ""Painted Skin"") as a man, and for twelve years at that!
