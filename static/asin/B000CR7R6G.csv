Incoherent and badly scripted, acted and directed, this is a real triumph for incompetence. The loud, intrusive soundtrack, somewhere between latin and hip hop I suppose, does nothing but grate and, although I'm no prognosticator, I can't see any future for anyone involved in this sorry project.Worse yet, the title doesn't even feature in the film. What precious little energy the film has is long spent by the time we get to twilight.

Not that there is anything wrong with low budget but, usually they turn out to be pretty bad. Secondly, it takes a good half hour or more before anything starts to happen. The hip hop sound track didn't help it much either. I would definitely rent it before buying it.

I can't tell you what it was about.  This was just a convoluted mess.  I've been in a few low budget movies, and just because a film is done on a low budget doesn't mean it has to be incoherent.  I would almost bet that half the actors, and I use that term loosely, in this film probably could not tell you what the plot line was here.  Don't rent it.  Don't borrow it!

Then toss the paper and the DVD which came with the Box in the trash can .  I accept a low budget film can have bad acting, bad sets. [actually the sets were OK], but there must be a decent plot [or some plot]. The plot was just plain non existant. It moved slow, and never went anywhere. What were they thinking when they made this. The film actually was some what professionaly filmed[ editing, camera work etc.], too for a low budget feature. It is just a shame they had no real script. I agree with another reviewer, it is one of the worst. Anyway I just tossed out my copy.
