1645052,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00CA3M7L0,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 2]","Yay, nepotism! Normally, I frown on those whose names require four consonants before the vowel finally shows up, but bless the Schroders, they're obviously a close-knit fam. And a ""family that likes to do things together"" sounds ever so much kinder than ""favoritism granted in business regardless of merit."" Hallmark's 2013 family programming, Our Wild Hearts, is obviously very much a labor of love for the Schroders. It's intended primarily to showcase Rick's daughter, Cambrie, but Rick's wife, Andrea, co-writes and - produces and their sons, Luke and Holden, have supporting roles. And not that I remember seeing her in the film but rumor has it that Rick's younger daughter, Faith, has a cameo as well.Rick Schroder wears all the hats here. He co-writes, co-produces, directs, and acts here. He plays Jack, a weathered cowboy who is on the verge of losing his ranch in the Sierra Nevada mountains. The last thing he needed was a visit from Willow Johnson (Cambrie Schroder), a 15-year-old girl claiming to be his daughter.Cambrie Schroder has got skills. She does a fine job of transitioning from callow Malibu diva to earnest teen with a cause. Willow and Jack's first moments together are deliberately awkward, but they do find commonality with their shared love of horses. Their shared love of horses is also what causes a major rift between them. Jack catches wild horses for a living. He breaks them in - some say he ""gentles"" these horses - and sells them for ""adoption."" His ongoing project is to bring in a majestic, wild stallion he's named Bravo. His chief rival, the slimy Grizz (Martin Kove), means to nab Bravo first. Willow herself is an expert horsewoman (horsegirl?) and she's instantly smitten with Bravo.The core conflict concerns Willow's belief that Bravo should be allowed to remain free to roam the wilds. Jack's belief is that he's arse-broke and desperately requires capital. It also doesn't help the sitch that Jack, even though he's only known his sudden daughter for three days, is so overprotective. He warns Willow to stay away from the captured and very dangerous Bravo. She protests that the horse would never hurt her. His rebuttal: ""Everything a horse does can be traced back to instincts, food, or shelter - not trying to please a human being.""Man, it's a long ways away from Silver Spoons (Erin Gray, a.k.a. Colonel Wilma Deering, I'm still crushing on you). Rick Schroder is finally, finally showing his age (Dick Clark was starting to worry). Still, it's jarring to hear one of the characters so dismissively refer to Schroder as ""old man."" When I saw his name (everywhere) on the opening credits, I couldn't pass up watching this movie. And he's okay as the laconic (I don't want to say ""stiff"") cowboy dad. I don't know that I buy him as a horse-breaker. Cambrie is the one to watch, and, undoubtedly, that's very much in accord with her dad's plan. She turns in a spirited performance. She seems a natural.Our Wild Hearts is a coming-of-age story and it's family friendly. And I hate to rain on the feelgoodness of it all, but there were some not so good bits. Maybe my biggest gripe is that things fall in place too easily. The shifts in relationship come abruptly. It'd be different if the story took place over the span of several weeks, instead of mere days. I'm also not keen on how Martin Kove's character is painted as such a cartoony big bad. So, for me, there were bits that just didn't ring true.It's weird, but my favorite moment is when Willow can't find cell phone reception in Jack's ranch and has to use an old school rotary phone. I grinned at how so excited she got when she finally figured out how to dial the thing. Incidentally, how did her mom (Angela Lindvall) instantly know it was her when she picked up on the other end? Man, I should've included this in the prior paragraph when I was listing my gripes. Anyway, for all its flaws, I still recommend this film, especially if you're a Ricky Schroder fan or if you want to see new talent on the horizon. And for trivia buffs, it's pretty neat that Jack's ranch is actually the set that was used to shoot some little television series called Little House on the Prairie.
