It is a shame that this is the best that these amazing African American actors can get in terms of work.  Hill Harper's character is days away from marrying his beautiful fiance Charli (Zoe Saldana) when Charli runs into her former fiance and still aspiring actor Cool. Cool's reappearance in Charli's life makes her rethink her pending marriage. It's not that this is a completely horrible story, but the story line and production are average at best. These movie is slow in parts and contains out of place comedic scenes that border on buffoonery.

This woman is a terrible actress to me.  Her acting is so bland.

It was like watching a movie within a movie, but this particular storyline didn't fit.This movie really didn't look like a B-movie.

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[13, 14]","When the movie first started out and it was set up like a movie inside a movie, I was a little concerned.  I didn't know if I could get into the typed letters at every scene and when Cool did the burger commercial but complained about stereotypical roles, it reminded me a little of ""Bamboozled."" But I'd never heard of Code Black films until a couple of weeks ago, and the more he talked about his struggle as trying to be a Black actor with positive roles, the more it made sense that movies like this need to be put out.  Very gradually, the movie grew on me.""Premium"" is about a woman (Zoe Saldana) who is about to get married, but after going to a gas station, she surprisingly meets her ex fiance, Cool.  Old memories come back to her and she tries to scurry away before they can engulf her thoughts and make her think twice about her engagement. The problem is she ends up in a car accident and right back at that same gas station to get her car fixed and maybe her relationship(s) fixed too. Her fiance meets Cool. Cool reacts. Her fiance reacts. She reacts. Watch the movie to find out how these three work this confusing situation out.Pros: I spent 75% of the time watching this movie peeking through my fingers. There were so many uncomfortable moments (I mean that in a good way--as in, I felt like I was Zoe Saldana's character and pretty much every reaction she went through, I could sympathize with her), and I kept mumbling ""Aw man, this is awkward."" The beginning was shaky, the middle was interesting, and the end was exactly how I expected it to end, but not how I wanted it to end.  I'm not a hopeless romantic; I'm a realist.  But sometimes realists can be romantics too.  In this movie, romance and love meet with the ideals of marriage and the decisions made are hard but true. Hill Harper is a GREAT actor. I hadn't followed his acting career at all up until this moment, but I had to grin at the bed/blanket scene.  That was definitely a switch of roles!Best Scene: The garlic scene--you know you're comfortable in a relationship when you can talk like that to each other, plus the face Zoe made was hilarious.  I thought that scene was very cute.Cons: The only con I can give to this movie was that in the beginning of the movie, Zoe's character asked for unleaded gas. At the end of the movie, she asked for premium, but it looks like she was in the same car.  I remember having a car repair a couple weeks ago and a mechanic at my dealership saying mixing gas is not a good idea. I know that's technical, but it was something I caught.  Other than that, this was a pretty good film.",4,It grew on me...,1191974400,"10 10, 2007",2007,2610,"['When', 'movie', 'first', 'started', 'out', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'movie', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'concerned', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'could', 'get', 'typed', 'letters', 'scene', 'when', 'Cool', 'did', 'burger', 'commercial', 'complained', 'stereotypical', 'roles', 'reminded', 'little', 'Bamboozled', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'Code', 'Black', 'films', 'couple', 'weeks', 'ago', 'more', 'talked', 'struggle', 'trying', 'be', 'Black', 'actor', 'positive', 'roles', 'more', 'made', 'sense', 'movies', 'need', 'be', 'put', 'out', 'Very', 'gradually', 'movie', 'grew', 'Premium', 'woman', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'who', 'get', 'married', 'going', 'gas', 'station', 'surprisingly', 'ex', 'fiance', 'Cool', 'Old', 'come', 'back', 'scurry', 'away', 'can', 'engulf', 'thoughts', 'make', 'think', 'twice', 'engagement', 'problem', 'up', 'car', 'accident', 'right', 'back', 'same', 'gas', 'station', 'get', 'car', 'fixed', 'maybe', 'relationship', 's', 'fixed', 'too', 'fiance', 'meets', 'Cool', 'Cool', 'fiance', 'reacts', 'Watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'three', 'work', 'confusing', 'situation', 'spent', '75', '%', 'time', 'watching', 'movie', 'peeking', 'fingers', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'uncomfortable', 'moments', 'mean', 'good', 'way', 'felt', 'was', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'character', 'pretty', 'much', 'reaction', 'went', 'could', 'sympathize', 'kept', 'mumbling', 'Aw', 'man', 'awkward', 'beginning', 'was', 'shaky', 'middle', 'was', 'interesting', 'end', 'was', 'exactly', 'how', 'expected', 'end', 'not', 'how', 'wanted', 'end', ""'m"", 'not', 'hopeless', 'romantic', ""'m"", 'realist', 'sometimes', 'realists', 'can', 'be', 'romantics', 'too', 'movie', 'romance', 'love', 'meet', 'ideals', 'marriage', 'decisions', 'made', 'are', 'hard', 'true', 'Hill', 'Harper', 'GREAT', 'actor', 'had', ""n't"", 'followed', 'acting', 'career', 'up', 'moment', 'had', 'grin', 'bed/blanket', 'scene', 'was', 'definitely', 'switch', 'roles', 'Best', 'Scene', 'garlic', 'scene', 'know', ""'re"", 'comfortable', 'relationship', 'when', 'can', 'talk', 'other', 'face', 'Zoe', 'made', 'was', 'hilarious', 'thought', 'scene', 'was', 'very', 'cute.Cons', 'only', 'con', 'can', 'give', 'movie', 'was', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Zoe', 'character', 'asked', 'unleaded', 'gas', 'end', 'movie', 'asked', 'premium', 'was', 'same', 'car', 'remember', 'having', 'car', 'repair', 'couple', 'weeks', 'ago', 'mechanic', 'dealership', 'saying', 'mixing', 'gas', 'not', 'good', 'idea', 'know', 'technical', 'was', 'something', 'caught', 'Other', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'film']",Premium
