Shows like Hermin's Head, The Ben Stiller Show, In Living Color, The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., Married with Children, and of course, Get A Life were aimed at the Generation X crowd and were right on target.  I always felt that Get A Life was an under-appreciated masterpiece of situation comedy.  Chris Elliot is one of the more gifted television writers from his generation and he certainly didn't disappoint with the bizarre world of his self-portrayed protagonist.  I think this is one of those love it or hate it-type shows and it's more of a guy show than anything else.  I was very happy to see that the complete series was released after all those years of re-watching the dozen or so episodes that Rhino Video put out.  To any fan of early FOX television, this is a gold mine of a collection.  Caveat emptor:  The quality of the video isn't that good, but it's no worse than the quality of the Rhino collection.

But I'll spare you.This is it! All 35 episodes with the original music, not the mass produced limited syndication episodes that appeared on USA network. Thanks to music rights, those had regurgitated fill in music, which just made my skin crawl. The theme song ""Stand"" is back, ""Hey There Georgie Girl"", ""Obsession"", etc. Just ONE of the many reasons I am so happy with this release. Why couldn't the producers of WKRP do the same? Worth the extra $$$! Most of the episodes, mercifully, are presented with the option to play without a laugh track. (Like you need to be reminded that this is humor?) All episodes have commentary by Mirkin.If you don't know ""Get A Life"" but are a fan of Chris Elliot, then where the heck have you been? This is one of Chris Elliot's crowning achievements! A seminal surrealist non-sitcom sitcom that really breaks all the rules. ALL OF THEM. The main character is unapologetically rude, ridiculously stupid and likably unlikable(?!?). I particularly like the second and final season. They must have been told they were being cancelled and they said what the heck, and cut loose with the writing. &lt;Spoiler> Chris must die at the end of every episode that season, and it's hilarious. Gus, his landlord played by Brian Doyle Murray, made the perfect heavy/straightman! Gus is as violently stupid as Chris, only slightly less socially obtuse! They are perfect together!. Priceless!UPDATE! I've now watched the first four discs, this series just keeps getting better and better. ""Chris Moves Out"" has my favorite musical comedy montage of all time set to the tune of ""Hey There Georgie Girl""; SEVERED HEAD! In the USA network version the song was replaced with ""Hey there Silly Guy"" or something. UGH! It just made me cringe! But here it is fully restored and hilarious! This episode alone is worth the price of the set! It is all and more than I remembered! Seriously I thought there were only 22 episodes (Which I have on video tape), but NO, There are 35! I can finally throw away those old well worn Tapes. WAHOO!I bought this eagerly, and if it comes out a Blu-Ray I will buy it again. It's that D@mn Funny!

1548908,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0089BSNVK,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[79, 85]","There is little doubt that many of today's slacker comedies owe a debt of gratitude to the great Chris Elliott and ""Get A Life.""  Referred to as the anti-sitcom during its two season (1990-92) run on FOX, the show seemed ahead of its time for network TV (thank goodness for the early years of the fledgling FOX) and would more likely be produced for cable these days.  Bold, ridiculous, yet strangely identifiable--you never quite knew where Elliott and his cohorts were going to take you in a given episode.  The sensibilities of ""Get A Life"" were definitely off-kilter and rarely have I so willingly followed a protagonist that showcased an ever diminishing grasp on the real world.  The beauty of this show, which defied categorization, was its unpredictability.  Many of the episodes concluded with violent and/or perplexing life or death situations and we weren't always guaranteed a survivor, something we wouldn't see again until South Park's Kenny made repeatedly dying fashionable.Both seasons of all 35 episodes are being compiled in this 5 disc DVD set.  The collection boasts a variety of extras:Essay by TV Critic Tom ShalesInterviews with Co-Creator David Mirkin and Writers Jace Richdale and Steve PepoonPanel Interview By Cast and Creators At Paleyfest 2000Audio Commentary on Select EpisodesDeleted Scenes on Select EpisodesAlternate Audio on Select Episodes (without laugh track)If you've never seen ""Get A Life,"" Elliott (coming off his successful guest spots on Letterman's Late Show) created what would become his signature role.  As a 30 year old paperboy living at home with his parents, he had big dreams, big ideas, and an indefatigable cluelessness.  Whether he was engaged in time travel, gang warfare, the male escort business, or any number of other nonsensical plot lines--this is a show that never played it safe!  Elliot's real life dad, Bob Elliott, played his fictional papa as well with Elinor Donahue as his mom.  While the plots got bigger and more eccentric, I always appreciated the domestic aspect just as much as it grounded the proceedings.""Get A Life,"" as I mentioned, seemed unlike anything on TV during the time it aired.  That's why it holds up so well today.  As programming has expanded, the options have become increasingly diverse and challenging.  Chris Elliott branded himself as America's Most Lovable Psycho and created an enduring cult classic that is ready to be discovered by a new generation!  So whether you are discovering this anew or revisiting an old friend, there is still a lot to appreciate in this distinctly weird but absolutely hilarious endeavor.

Upon putting the first disc of this series into the DVD player I was bracing for yet another ""ugh"" moment which would have relegated this box set to an early retirement on the shelf, or for sale on an auction website.  That feeling was gone about :30 seconds into the first episode, after Chris Peterson declares (wearing nothing except boxer shorts) ""That's the last time I eat a whole box of Steak Umms right before bed,"" and launches into a morning exercise routine while blasting ""Living In America.""  After falling out of the chair laughing, I was quickly reassured that the absurd, unpredictable, and completely out of left field humor that I enjoyed every single Sunday night on Fox way back in the day remains completely intact, even despite the passage of time.  In fact, I seem to enjoy the show much more than I did back then.  Since it's been so long since I've seen most of these episodes, it's literally like watching them for the first time all over again.  Probably the best TV series purchase I've made in many years, and no doubt an item that will be among the most enjoyed my collection.As for the transfer quality, no its not perfect.  Its grainy and inconsistent at times, and thats putting it kindly. Consider however that the show was filmed in standard definition on video tape the late 80's / early 90's when Fox was practically still a start-up network, and that the show never pulled in huge ratings (not to mention that it was barely syndicated and sitting in a vault for over twenty years), and the last DVD releases of select episodes back in 2000 never came anywhere near setting any kind of sales records.  That all said it is fairly unreasonable to expect this package to be anything other than straight dub from the master tapes with minimal to no restoration work done.  No way this was going to get the THX or Critereon treatment; and why should it?  The fact that these episodes still even exist (many with cast and crew commentaries!) and that I now own them is good enough for me.  The blemishes in this ""Un-Special Non-Anniversary Edition"" almost add to its nostalgic appeal.

1548918,A2WEH6H5AGO94E,B0089BSNVK,TheNoomz83,"[1, 2]","""Get a Life"" is to TV sitcoms as Samuel Beckett's ""Waiting for Godot"" was to all the stage plays that ever came before it.  This is absurdist, non-conformist fare that is intended to challenge traditionalist and conformist sensibilities and notions.  It's five stars for me, and I feel safe recommending it this highly here because, if you're here, you're among the relatively few who are aware of this show and know who Chris Elliott is (and who also may be familiar with his father Bob).  But I don't go around recommending it to many people I know because most people don't like the mold to be broken--and this show breaks the mold as no other offering in its genre has ever done (that's ""mould"" for our British friends).  This is comedy of dysfunction.  This is a show that dares to be stupid--but brilliantly stupid.  In the eyes of the universe (to use an absurd metaphor) we can only be viewed as incredibly stupid (and dysfunctional) beings.  The co-creator (small ""c""'s) of this show, David Mirkin, is okay with this and even celebrates this absurd human condition--and just wants us to keep going as long as we can before the cosmic power of the universe (in Mirkin's and the show's case, the cosmic corporate power of the Fox network) cancels us.  (By the way, thanks, Dave, for the superb commentary on all the episodes.)Chris, the outwardly oblivious-to-reality anti-sitcom-star of the show actually engages in more introspection  than any other sitcom star ever has.  If he is ultimately clueless, aren't we all?  If he is ultimately Canadian, Montreal?  Because of the possibility our existence may be part of some cosmic joke, I can't refrain from tossing in a gratuitous ""bad"" joke; neither can Dave Mirkin and the other writers on this series.  Why not?  And if ""why not?"" is a question you enjoy posing, there's a good chance you'll enjoy this series.The opening episode of the series, ""Terror on the Hell Loop,"" literally and figuratively turns the traditional sitcom upside-down, as well as creating a dandy little metaphor for the human condition.  ""The Big City"" (a.k.a. the ""Wallet Boy"" episode) is among the greatest 23 minutes of comedy ever aired on TV, featuring the series' best guest performance (by Anastasia Barzee).  This one, had it not been made for television, would easily be worthy (thinking in conventional terms) of a short subject Academy Award.  ""Neptune 2000"" challenges in both the metaphor and sheer brilliance departments.  Chris Elliott gives a spectacular tour-de-farce performance in ""The Prettiest Week of My Life,"" the episode that first features Brian Doyle-Murray, who is exceptional as Gus in the second season (that's ""Series Two"" for our British friends).",5,absurdist fare that you may find brilliant (or brilliantly stupid) - or you may not be able to find at all,1370304000,"06 4, 2013",2013,2711,"['Get', 'Life', 'TV', 'sitcoms', 'Samuel', 'Beckett', 'Waiting', 'Godot', 'was', 'stage', 'ever', 'came', 'absurdist', 'non-conformist', 'fare', 'intended', 'challenge', 'traditionalist', 'conformist', 'sensibilities', 'notions', 'five', 'stars', 'feel', 'safe', 'recommending', 'highly', 'here', ""'re"", 'here', ""'re"", 'relatively', 'few', 'who', 'are', 'aware', 'show', 'know', 'who', 'Chris', 'Elliott', 'who', 'also', 'may', 'be', 'familiar', 'father', 'Bob', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'around', 'recommending', 'many', 'people', 'know', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'mold', 'be', 'broken', 'show', 'mold', 'other', 'offering', 'genre', 'ever', 'done', 'mould', 'British', 'friends', 'comedy', 'dysfunction', 'show', 'be', 'stupid', 'brilliantly', 'stupid', 'eyes', 'universe', 'use', 'absurd', 'metaphor', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'viewed', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'dysfunctional', 'beings', 'co-creator', 'small', 'c', 'show', 'David', 'Mirkin', 'okay', 'even', 'absurd', 'human', 'condition', 'just', 'keep', 'going', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'cosmic', 'power', 'universe', 'Mirkin', 'show', 'case', 'cosmic', 'corporate', 'power', 'Fox', 'network', 'way', 'thanks', 'Dave', 'superb', 'commentary', 'episodes', 'Chris', 'outwardly', 'oblivious-to-reality', 'anti-sitcom-star', 'show', 'actually', 'more', 'introspection', 'other', 'sitcom', 'star', 'ever', 'ultimately', 'clueless', 'are', ""n't"", 'ultimately', 'Canadian', 'Montreal', 'possibility', 'existence', 'may', 'be', 'part', 'cosmic', 'joke', 'ca', ""n't"", 'refrain', 'tossing', 'gratuitous', 'bad', 'joke', 'can', 'Dave', 'Mirkin', 'other', 'writers', 'series', 'Why', 'not', 'why', 'not', 'question', 'enjoy', 'posing', 'good', 'chance', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'series.The', 'opening', 'episode', 'series', 'Terror', 'Hell', 'Loop', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'traditional', 'sitcom', 'upside-down', 'as', 'well', 'creating', 'dandy', 'little', 'metaphor', 'human', 'condition', 'Big', 'City', 'a.k.a', 'Wallet', 'Boy', 'episode', 'greatest', '23', 'minutes', 'comedy', 'ever', 'aired', 'TV', 'featuring', 'series', 'best', 'guest', 'performance', 'Anastasia', 'Barzee', 'one', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'made', 'television', 'would', 'easily', 'be', 'worthy', 'thinking', 'conventional', 'terms', 'short', 'subject', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Neptune', '2000', 'challenges', 'metaphor', 'sheer', 'brilliance', 'departments', 'Chris', 'Elliott', 'spectacular', 'tour-de-farce', 'performance', 'Prettiest', 'Week', 'My', 'Life', 'episode', 'first', 'features', 'Brian', 'Doyle-Murray', 'who', 'exceptional', 'Gus', 'second', 'season', 'Series', 'Two', 'British', 'friends']",N/A
