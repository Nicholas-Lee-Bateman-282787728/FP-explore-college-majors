750346,AVV1ACH67XI85,B00008YLUP,"Davalon ""Davalon""","[4, 8]","As ""plot"" summaries are mentioned earlier on these pages, let me get straight to the point: This is a godawful waste of time. The best thing that can be said about this film is that the camera angles were interesting. Other than that, this boring chatfest features a must-be-seen performance by Dick Chamberlain where he channels Bette Davis, Truman Capote, and Winston Churchill -- simultaneously.So, a dying gay lawyer wants to leave his fortune to two hustlers he spent time with. Okay -- an intriguing premise. But unfortunately, there is not one single believable relationship or character in the entire film.I kept watching this film in amazement. The ""lead"" hustler kept saying either to others or to himself, ""What do you mean? Why did you say that? Why the f**k am I here? What the f**k does that mean?"" and questions of that nature. And as he asked them, so did I: What was the meaning of this whole insane waste of time?Then there were fun scenes with the ""big stars"" -- Talia Shire ""plays"" the ""part"" of ""mother"" of the second hustler. She has two pointless, irritating scenes, one where the only thing taking up the frame is her head and her hustler son's head as she rambles and goes on about something that had no meaning. Then later we get to see her sleeping in a chair. Good job, Talia! Another Oscar nomination for you!But the worst offender of all is Dick Chamberlain. Dick says certain lines as if he has imbued them with some magical wit or humor or sarcasm, as if he has elevated them to some Shakespearean level. As if what he is forced to say has some meaning. Hate to break it to you Dick: it doesn't -- none of it does, did or will.This movie almost defies description. If you want to study what not to do when making a movie, this would be an excellent reference.This movie satisfied my curiousity about the lives of hustlers: sad, tragic, dangerous, filled with unhappiness and loneliness.",1,Pointless,1147478400,"05 13, 2006",2006,1918,"['plot', 'summaries', 'are', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'pages', 'let', 'get', 'straight', 'point', 'godawful', 'waste', 'time', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'film', 'camera', 'angles', 'were', 'interesting', 'Other', 'boring', 'chatfest', 'must-be-seen', 'performance', 'Dick', 'Chamberlain', 'where', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'simultaneously.So', 'dying', 'gay', 'lawyer', 'leave', 'fortune', 'two', 'hustlers', 'spent', 'time', 'Okay', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'one', 'single', 'believable', 'relationship', 'character', 'entire', 'film.I', 'kept', 'watching', 'film', 'amazement', 'lead', 'hustler', 'kept', 'saying', 'either', 'others', 'What', 'do', 'mean', 'Why', 'did', 'say', 'Why', 'f**k', 'am', 'here', 'What', 'f**k', 'mean', 'questions', 'nature', 'asked', 'so', 'did', 'What', 'was', 'meaning', 'whole', 'insane', 'waste', 'time', 'Then', 'were', 'fun', 'scenes', 'big', 'stars', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'plays', 'part', 'mother', 'second', 'hustler', 'two', 'pointless', 'irritating', 'scenes', 'one', 'where', 'only', 'thing', 'taking', 'up', 'frame', 'head', 'hustler', 'son', 'head', 'something', 'had', 'meaning', 'Then', 'later', 'get', 'see', 'sleeping', 'chair', 'Good', 'job', 'Talia', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'worst', 'offender', 'Dick', 'Chamberlain', 'Dick', 'certain', 'lines', 'imbued', 'magical', 'wit', 'humor', 'sarcasm', 'elevated', 'Shakespearean', 'level', 'what', 'forced', 'say', 'meaning', 'Hate', 'break', 'Dick', ""n't"", 'none', 'did', 'will.This', 'movie', 'almost', 'description', 'want', 'study', 'what', 'not', 'do', 'when', 'making', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'excellent', 'reference.This', 'movie', 'satisfied', 'curiousity', 'lives', 'hustlers', 'sad', 'tragic', 'dangerous', 'filled', 'unhappiness', 'loneliness']",River Made to Drown In

Perhaps with Richard Chamberlain's new book about his 'coming out' on the bookstore shelves more interest will be created for this well made, well acted, albeit dark film.  This is a slice of life in LA that manages to capture an atmosphere that propels the story of a once wealthy lawyer who, dying of AIDS, returns to an ex-lover to 'replay' his former life before dying.  Richard Chamberlain is Thaddeus and the 'hustler' to whom he turns is Allen, played to perfection by Michael Imperioli.  Allen is still 'hustling' but at this point his target is a female gallery owner (another excellent performance by Ute Lemper). Thaddeus moves in with Allen with the proviso that Allen find Thaddeus' last hustler lover, one Jaime (again played with conviction and subtlely by James Duval)for final goodbyes.  In the end all are faced with the emptiness of the 'live life for the moment ethic' of the Hustler and the John and the vacuum created by Thaddeus' death seems to open the door of possible change for those remaining.Though obviously a low budget film, the director makes excellent use of lighting and locations to create the seedy stench of Santa Monica Bovd and the attendant degrading scenes.  The music score uses Mozart's &quot;Ave Verum Corpus&quot; and the 'Lacrymosa' from his Requiem to fine effect.  In the end it is the quality of performances by Chamberlain, Imperioli (his most sensitive role to date and not at all like his role in The Sopranos), Lemper, and Duval (along with some fine cameo roles from the supporting cast) that makes this a film well worth seeing.  Though not for the staunchly homophobic viewer, the general public will gain a better understanding about a segment of life that is usually hidden from view.",4,A Brave and Artistic Film,1057795200,"07 10, 2003",2003,1867,"['RIVER', 'MADE', 'TO', 'DROWN', 'IN', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'shame', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'wider', 'audience', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'Perhaps', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'new', 'book', ""'coming"", 'out', 'bookstore', 'more', 'interest', 'will', 'be', 'created', 'well', 'made', 'well', 'acted', 'dark', 'film', 'slice', 'life', 'LA', 'capture', 'atmosphere', 'story', 'once', 'wealthy', 'lawyer', 'who', 'dying', 'AIDS', 'ex-lover', ""'replay"", 'former', 'life', 'dying', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'Thaddeus', ""'hustler"", 'whom', 'Allen', 'played', 'perfection', 'Michael', 'Imperioli', 'Allen', 'still', ""'hustling"", 'point', 'target', 'female', 'gallery', 'owner', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Ute', 'Lemper', 'Thaddeus', 'Allen', 'proviso', 'Allen', 'find', 'Thaddeus', 'last', 'hustler', 'lover', 'one', 'Jaime', 'again', 'played', 'conviction', 'subtlely', 'James', 'Duval', 'final', 'goodbyes', 'end', 'are', 'faced', 'emptiness', ""'live"", 'life', 'moment', 'ethic', 'Hustler', 'John', 'vacuum', 'created', 'Thaddeus', 'death', 'open', 'door', 'possible', 'change', 'remaining.Though', 'obviously', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'director', 'excellent', 'use', 'lighting', 'locations', 'create', 'seedy', 'stench', 'Santa', 'Monica', 'Bovd', 'attendant', 'degrading', 'scenes', 'music', 'score', 'Mozart', 'quot', 'Ave', 'Verum', 'Corpus', 'quot', ""'Lacrymosa"", 'Requiem', 'fine', 'effect', 'end', 'quality', 'performances', 'Chamberlain', 'Imperioli', 'most', 'sensitive', 'role', 'date', 'not', 'role', 'Sopranos', 'Lemper', 'Duval', 'fine', 'cameo', 'roles', 'supporting', 'cast', 'film', 'well', 'seeing', 'not', 'staunchly', 'homophobic', 'viewer', 'general', 'public', 'will', 'gain', 'better', 'understanding', 'segment', 'life', 'usually', 'hidden', 'view']",River Made to Drown In

Allen is wooing an encouraging, well-to-do art gallery owner, Eva Kline (played by Ute Lemper). Then along comes Thaddeus MacKenzie (played by Richard Chamberlain), a wealthy lawyer client of Allen's from years back. Thaddeus, closing out his life before he dies from AIDS, asks to stay with Allen and asks Allen to perform one last favor, to find another, current hustler named Jaime (played by James Duval). Thaddeus loved just Allen and Jaime and wants to do well by both of them. Allen resists but takes on the task. What does Eva think of all this? Why does Jaime lead so dangerous life and not cooperate? As events move along, Allen has to figure out who he really is and how he can make a difference. He ends up an ok guy.It is surprising such a movie would have so strong a cast in the key roles. Chamberlain gives Thaddeus a hearty gay-CEO bonhommie, deliberately (and appropriately) trying to bluster and charm his way past others. Michael Imperioli's Allen is a defensive guy in a shell who lashes out when others get too close. James Duval's Jaime is a believably wary hustler and a believably seeking Buddhist. The supporting cast is fair.The concept of Allen's character development was interesting. The script was moderately good.Allen and Jaime have some dreary to mildly kinky discreet sex scenes with clients. Skin shots are primarily and frequently of Allen. Jaime and Thaddeus display considerably less. In this arena, the back cover of the DVD case, the DVD itself, and the menu all contain a hot-looking picture of Jaime and his co-worker Luis (played by Michael Saucedo) in a bathtub. In the movie, there are only a couple of five-second glorified head-shots from this scene. This advertising still/deleted material could have gone into a photo gallery.The end credits announce a ""making of"" team, but the DVD has no ""making of"", deleted scenes, interviews, photo gallery, or commentary. The film deserves more.",3,Getting Some Direction in Life,1057104000,"07 2, 2003",2003,2067,"['River', 'Made', 'Drown', 'looks', 'Allen', 'Hayden', 'played', 'Michael', 'Imperioli', 'ex-hustler', 'trying', 'make', 'good', 'modern', 'painter', 'Allen', 'wooing', 'encouraging', 'well-to-do', 'art', 'gallery', 'owner', 'Eva', 'Kline', 'played', 'Ute', 'Lemper', 'Then', 'Thaddeus', 'MacKenzie', 'played', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'wealthy', 'lawyer', 'client', 'Allen', 'years', 'back', 'Thaddeus', 'closing', 'out', 'life', 'AIDS', 'stay', 'Allen', 'Allen', 'perform', 'one', 'last', 'favor', 'find', 'current', 'hustler', 'named', 'Jaime', 'played', 'James', 'Duval', 'Thaddeus', 'loved', 'just', 'Allen', 'Jaime', 'do', 'well', 'Allen', 'resists', 'task', 'What', 'Eva', 'think', 'Why', 'Jaime', 'lead', 'so', 'dangerous', 'life', 'not', 'cooperate', 'events', 'move', 'along', 'Allen', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'really', 'how', 'can', 'make', 'difference', 'up', 'ok', 'guy.It', 'surprising', 'such', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'so', 'strong', 'cast', 'key', 'roles', 'Chamberlain', 'Thaddeus', 'hearty', 'gay-CEO', 'bonhommie', 'deliberately', 'appropriately', 'trying', 'bluster', 'charm', 'way', 'others', 'Michael', 'Imperioli', 'Allen', 'defensive', 'guy', 'shell', 'who', 'out', 'when', 'others', 'get', 'too', 'close', 'James', 'Duval', 'Jaime', 'believably', 'wary', 'hustler', 'believably', 'seeking', 'Buddhist', 'supporting', 'cast', 'fair.The', 'concept', 'Allen', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'interesting', 'script', 'was', 'moderately', 'good.Allen', 'Jaime', 'have', 'dreary', 'mildly', 'kinky', 'discreet', 'sex', 'scenes', 'clients', 'Skin', 'shots', 'are', 'primarily', 'frequently', 'Allen', 'Jaime', 'Thaddeus', 'display', 'considerably', 'less', 'arena', 'back', 'cover', 'DVD', 'case', 'DVD', 'menu', 'contain', 'hot-looking', 'picture', 'Jaime', 'co-worker', 'Luis', 'played', 'Michael', 'Saucedo', 'bathtub', 'movie', 'are', 'only', 'couple', 'five-second', 'glorified', 'head-shots', 'scene', 'advertising', 'still/deleted', 'material', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'photo', 'gallery.The', 'end', 'credits', 'announce', 'making', 'team', 'DVD', 'making', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'interviews', 'photo', 'gallery', 'commentary', 'film', 'more']",River Made to Drown In
