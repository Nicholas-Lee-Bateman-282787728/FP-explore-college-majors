I'm not sure which one was more odd looking, the relative who came in from (not sure) or the provocative policeman with the oddest shaped nose. The one i really felt for was the one who's overlooked, the dumped in an instant Christine, who's a brunette in black so she's pretty disposable in terms of any semblance of a plot. I liked that once the gay character gets what he wants, he doesn't want it anymore, we've all been there but i liked the movie more than i expected to. One confusing point in terms of translation, this movie is not in Turkish, it's in German with subtitles, the title of the film in Turkish appeared to be the same name as the character who's not the visitor.",4,turks in Berlin,1375142400,"07 30, 2013",2013,852,"['are', 'so', 'many', 'there', 'i', 'guess', 'had', 'happen', 'someone', 'falling', 'love', 'significant', 'other', 'relative', 'who', 'sleeping', 'German', 'equivalent', 'futon', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'one', 'was', 'more', 'odd', 'looking', 'relative', 'who', 'came', 'not', 'sure', 'provocative', 'policeman', 'oddest', 'shaped', 'nose', 'one', 'i', 'really', 'felt', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'overlooked', 'dumped', 'instant', 'Christine', 'who', 'brunette', 'black', 'pretty', 'disposable', 'terms', 'semblance', 'plot', 'liked', 'once', 'gay', 'character', 'what', ""n't"", 'want', 'anymore', ""'ve"", 'been', 'i', 'liked', 'movie', 'more', 'i', 'expected', 'One', 'confusing', 'point', 'terms', 'translation', 'movie', 'not', 'Turkish', 'German', 'subtitles', 'title', 'film', 'Turkish', 'appeared', 'be', 'same', 'name', 'character', 'who', 'not', 'visitor']",The Visitor

The cousin comes to town and the boyfriend starts lurking around his bedroom at night while his girlfriend is sleeping down the hall and the cousin lies asleep half naked in bed. And then one day the boyfriend literally crosses the boundary, into the cousin's bedroom, walking across the floor and as he lays sleeping, reaches out his hand and begins to caress the cousin's sleeping form! It's a little like David's Birthday in that way but this film sadly falls short after the discovery.

1645419,AFZU6XDO5L75R,B00CBIC1H4,"Darien Wells ""darien""","[19, 21]","Cibrail (Sinan Hancili) is a Turkish policeman living in Berlin with his girlfriend. He has generally been somewhat repulsed by homosexuals, BUT underneath it all he hides an attraction to men that has obviously never been explored. Not until Marco (Engin Sert) arrives anyway. Marco is his girlfriends cousin who comes for a visit from Rome. There is an instant attraction for Cibrail who begins trying to deal with his inner feelings.Marco on the other hand doesn't seem attracted in return but perhaps is supposed to be. Not until Cibrail is jogging through a public park and sees Marco receiving anonymous oral sex from another man, does he learn that there might be some promise here for exploring his sexuality with a man he actually sorta knows.I did not hate this film, however it's really not at all the best choice one can make here. There is a lot of downers on this indie. For starters, the actors portrayed their characters well, but they lack the ""feel"" for getting their plot across to the viewer. There is a great lack of chemistry between ANY of them. Cibrail is billed to be a policeman, but in the few scenes he is shown with his partner on patrol, he is more like a rookie jr. cop. The dialogue is poor all the way through the film for all roles involved and the lighting is too shadowy in many places.There are too many spaces with no dialogue whatsoever as it races through trying to set the pretense that Cibrail is coming to terms with things inside of him. He is supposedly in training for a marathon which the film for some reason never gets around to showing any signs of, or anyone else in Berlin training as well. Just one mention and that's all. Something about the Dr. said it's too late for this year, but nothing else stated as to what kind of medical condition may have delayed his training. Yet he jogs religiously with no sign of any other joggers, no advertisements, or public talk of a marathon. This is just one example of the sketchiness throughout this film.No man pursuing another man in his own house would be so bold as to get up in the middle of the night and get in the shower with his unsuspecting houseguest with his own girlfriend in the next room and no locks on the doors, or closed doors. There are several such spots in this film where it is just too unrealistic for the viewer to grasp. There is however one very nice shower scene at the beginning of the film where Cibrail shows everything very nicely for the camera. It is the only full frontal nudity but it's just enough to get your attention and entice you to keep watching in hopes that things might heat up. It is also the only exhibition of a fairly decent looking male, anywhere in this film.Sadly the plot never really picks up and nothing very steamy takes place either. There are a few butt shots and that's about all. If you have nothing else to do, this film will hold your attention throughout, but prepare yourself for a disppointment because it's plot and delivery are very weak. If you are easily entertained, you should like this one pretty well. It isn't a BAD film, it's just not a GOOD film. Should you be one of those people who are not at all easily entertained, I suspect you will not be happy viewing ""The Visitor"".",3,"""I didn't come here for secret sex"".",1371600000,"06 19, 2013",2013,3245,"['Cibrail', 'Sinan', 'Hancili', 'Turkish', 'policeman', 'living', 'Berlin', 'girlfriend', 'generally', 'been', 'somewhat', 'repulsed', 'homosexuals', 'BUT', 'attraction', 'men', 'obviously', 'never', 'been', 'explored', 'Not', 'Marco', 'Engin', 'Sert', 'anyway', 'Marco', 'girlfriends', 'cousin', 'who', 'visit', 'Rome', 'instant', 'attraction', 'Cibrail', 'who', 'trying', 'deal', 'inner', 'feelings.Marco', 'other', 'hand', ""n't"", 'seem', 'attracted', 'return', 'perhaps', 'supposed', 'be', 'Not', 'Cibrail', 'jogging', 'public', 'park', 'sees', 'Marco', 'receiving', 'anonymous', 'oral', 'sex', 'man', 'learn', 'might', 'be', 'promise', 'here', 'exploring', 'sexuality', 'man', 'actually', 'sorta', 'knows.I', 'did', 'not', 'hate', 'film', 'however', 'really', 'not', 'best', 'choice', 'one', 'can', 'make', 'here', 'lot', 'downers', 'indie', 'starters', 'actors', 'portrayed', 'characters', 'well', 'lack', 'feel', 'getting', 'plot', 'viewer', 'great', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'ANY', 'Cibrail', 'billed', 'be', 'policeman', 'few', 'scenes', 'shown', 'partner', 'patrol', 'more', 'rookie', 'jr.', 'cop', 'dialogue', 'poor', 'way', 'film', 'roles', 'involved', 'lighting', 'too', 'shadowy', 'many', 'places.There', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'spaces', 'dialogue', 'whatsoever', 'trying', 'set', 'pretense', 'Cibrail', 'coming', 'terms', 'things', 'supposedly', 'training', 'marathon', 'film', 'reason', 'never', 'showing', 'signs', 'anyone', 'else', 'Berlin', 'training', 'as', 'well', 'Just', 'one', 'mention', 'Something', 'Dr.', 'said', 'too', 'late', 'year', 'nothing', 'else', 'stated', 'what', 'kind', 'medical', 'condition', 'may', 'have', 'delayed', 'training', 'religiously', 'sign', 'other', 'joggers', 'advertisements', 'public', 'talk', 'marathon', 'just', 'one', 'example', 'sketchiness', 'film.No', 'man', 'pursuing', 'man', 'own', 'house', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'bold', 'get', 'up', 'middle', 'night', 'get', 'shower', 'unsuspecting', 'houseguest', 'own', 'girlfriend', 'next', 'room', 'locks', 'doors', 'closed', 'doors', 'are', 'several', 'such', 'spots', 'film', 'where', 'just', 'too', 'unrealistic', 'viewer', 'grasp', 'however', 'one', 'very', 'nice', 'shower', 'scene', 'beginning', 'film', 'where', 'Cibrail', 'everything', 'very', 'nicely', 'camera', 'only', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'just', 'enough', 'get', 'attention', 'entice', 'keep', 'watching', 'hopes', 'things', 'might', 'heat', 'up', 'also', 'only', 'exhibition', 'fairly', 'decent', 'looking', 'male', 'anywhere', 'film.Sadly', 'plot', 'never', 'really', 'up', 'nothing', 'very', 'steamy', 'place', 'either', 'are', 'few', 'butt', 'shots', 'have', 'nothing', 'else', 'do', 'film', 'will', 'hold', 'attention', 'prepare', 'disppointment', 'plot', 'delivery', 'are', 'very', 'weak', 'are', 'easily', 'entertained', 'should', 'like', 'one', 'pretty', 'well', ""n't"", 'BAD', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'GOOD', 'film', 'Should', 'be', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'easily', 'entertained', 'suspect', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'happy', 'viewing', 'Visitor']",The Visitor

It's as if someone really, really wanted to make a gay movie but (1) didn't know anything about being gay, and (2) didn't know anything about making a movie.What's surprising is that it isn't in any way offensive. In fact, it's sort of touching, that someone cared enough to make a movie for us even though he didn't know how, sort of like a toddler making a homemade valentine for his parents: it's so sweet that only a jerk could be offended by its naive amateurishness.It's not even a particularly boring movie, although the last six of its 69 minutes are the end credits, scrolling so slowly you can hardly tell they're moving, while the most somniferous music I've ever heard drones along with them.There are also many shots of a tall, ugly, perforated metal sculpture standing in the middle of a river, and many short clips of cast members doing things like swimming, or walking, and then fade to black. Only the director knows what those clips are supposed to mean.The movie seems to have been made with a digital camera on auto-focus and auto-exposure, which I've never seen in a professionally released movie before. The acting and direction are clumsy at best, and there's no dialog to speak of.Cibril is not a good movie by any conventional standards, but I loved it. I'm going to watch it again, now that I know what to expect of it.So I can recommend it only to someone who is willing and able to receive it as a well-meant gift from a loving child, who can't yet draw a picture of you as you look to yourself, but very touchingly draws the love he sees in you.",4,Like a valentine from a toddler,1395705600,"03 25, 2014",2014,1606,"['strange', 'little', 'movie', 'someone', 'really', 'really', 'wanted', 'make', 'gay', 'movie', '1', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'being', 'gay', '2', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'making', 'movie.What', 'surprising', ""n't"", 'way', 'offensive', 'fact', 'sort', 'touching', 'someone', 'cared', 'enough', 'make', 'movie', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'sort', 'toddler', 'making', 'homemade', 'valentine', 'parents', 'so', 'sweet', 'only', 'jerk', 'could', 'be', 'offended', 'naive', 'amateurishness.It', 'not', 'even', 'particularly', 'boring', 'movie', 'last', 'six', '69', 'minutes', 'are', 'end', 'credits', 'scrolling', 'so', 'slowly', 'can', 'hardly', 'tell', ""'re"", 'moving', 'most', 'somniferous', 'music', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'drones', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'shots', 'tall', 'ugly', 'perforated', 'metal', 'sculpture', 'standing', 'middle', 'river', 'many', 'short', 'clips', 'cast', 'members', 'doing', 'things', 'swimming', 'walking', 'then', 'fade', 'black', 'Only', 'director', 'what', 'clips', 'are', 'supposed', 'mean.The', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'digital', 'camera', 'auto-focus', 'auto-exposure', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'professionally', 'released', 'movie', 'acting', 'direction', 'are', 'clumsy', 'best', 'dialog', 'speak', 'of.Cibril', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'conventional', 'standards', 'loved', ""'m"", 'going', 'watch', 'again', 'now', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'it.So', 'can', 'recommend', 'only', 'someone', 'who', 'willing', 'able', 'receive', 'well-meant', 'gift', 'loving', 'child', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'yet', 'draw', 'picture', 'look', 'very', 'touchingly', 'love']",The Visitor
