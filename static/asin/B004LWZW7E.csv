1416117,A34BUK6Q132V75,B004LWZW7E,Agnes,"[3, 4]","In Time presents an abnormal futuristic society where time is the newest currency of choice.  Enter Will Salas (played by Justin Timberlake), destined to live a life of little means, meaning he lives to gain more time, working, day in and day out, to prolong his own life and that of his mother, Rachel, played by Olivia Wilde.  If you're wondering about Olivia Wilde playing his mother, let me break things down for you.  Everyone physically stops aging at 25.  They have been genetically engineered not only to stop aging at 25 but also have an internal clock (okay, well, it's not so internal, because the countdown is visible on everyone's arm) that is counting down until the moment they die (and when they do die, it looks like they have some kind of massive heart attack, so maybe it's actually some internal bomb that destroys the heart, which, hey, since we don't get any explanations, could actually be mechanical).  In this way, it is possible for people to live hundreds of years, thus looking 25 but actually being around 38 and so on.  The catch is that they have to keep earning time by working (and lose it when making purchases, like buying food or wanting to take a bus).  When a person's clock reaches zero, they die.  The poor struggle for more time (little side conversations are dropped here and there about needing to hurry), while the rich are born and destined to live a long, long time.Everything changes the day Will encounters a rich and reckless Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer) who flashes his many years in one of the poorest sections of town, an act which incites trouble (keep a lookout for some futuristic gangsters, led by Fortis, played by Alex Pettyfer, and one of his cronies who dresses ridiculously - that hat annoyed me to death - he's supposed to look tough?) and sets this tale in motion.  Will saves his life, Henry reveals that he has lived a very long time and is ready for it all to end (he also drops some information that shocks Will but which isn't all that shocking to the viewer), and by morning, Henry is gone, and Will has more years than he has ever dreamed of earning.  Shortly after, a tragedy happens and Will is determined to get revenge.While I think this movie is interesting, you have to suspend your disbelief to enjoy it.  You're told that people stop aging at 25 due to genetic engineering, and then their countdown begins (which makes it possible to live forever if characters play their cards right)...but this isn't delved into too deeply.  The subject of health problems is never brought up, so I only assume that this is such an advanced society that even cancer has been eradicated (as no one in the movie is sick; also, no one is overweight, so I guess they've taken care of obesity as well).  Along with this, the entire subject of the genetic engineering that has led to this current state of affairs is mentioned the one time and never talked about again.  Characters also exchange time (which confused the heck out of me when the film began).  They hold onto each other or use a little metal device and can take and give time (again, this is never explained and the viewer is left to speculate how this is possible).  In Time doesn't explain things.  It doesn't explain what happened to illnesses, how aging was stopped, how this genetic engineering thing works (or even how it was accomplished), how people can physically exchange time in order to gain more or give their own freely, and even how time can be used as a currency.  I think these oversights (but hey, they might have just messed the movie up even more if they had been included, maybe leading to more confusion), along with bad casting (which is covered next), are the things which ruin this movie.I know Justin Timberlake mainly as a singer, and, while, I'm not against singers turned actors, I wasn't overly moved by his performance or even attached to his character.  I don't think he did an awful job, but it wasn't anything noteworthy, either.  On a similar note, Amanda Seyfried as the spoiled Sylvia Weis (who becomes the Bonnie to Will's Clyde) manages to make herself useful only by standing around, her eyes looking gigantic and catlike, her wig very fake, and her actions very robotic; oh, and let's not forget how smart it is to wear a pair of high heels (because being stylish when you're being naughty is oh, so intelligent; and you definitely won't have to run when being on the country's most wanted list - *please note the heavy sarcasm).  On the one hand, I find the concept of time as currency intriguing, but the movie drags on and on, the acting isn't the best (though Olivia Wilde and Cillian Murphy stand out), the amount of unanswered questions I had about this society grew and grew as the movie progressed, and there was a certain inconsistancy to some of the characters.Tragedy takes place, Will crosses the border separating the rich from the poor, and his sadness over his loss seems to vanish (barring instances where he's moodily staring off into space, all the while - of course - being watched by Sylvia and her massive eyes).  I was enjoying the movie before he went into the richer portion of town.  Once he went there, it was apparent that this movie was going to shirk the loss this character had undergone, and throw a lot out all for the sake of a romance with no spark (and a heroine whose sudden change in opinions felt rushed and out of character).  The first scenes between Will and Sylvia were annoying and didn't go with what had already taken place in the film.Later, Will and Sylvia take action and start behaving like a futuristic Robin Hood/Maid Marian pairing, stealing from the poor to give to the rich.  I thought this was a little interesting, but it wasn't enough.  Cillian Murphy's character had so much potential, not only in the development in his character but because he can actually act.  Unfortunately, I think what happens with this character was too predictable.  It was the easy way to end things, and it was also a cop-out.On a more positive note, I liked the futuristic police cars, the concept of the movie was interesting (though the message behind things was overly stressed), and I enjoyed certain scenes.  I've considered whether I think this is worth a 2.5 (not possible on Amazon) or 3 star rating, and I'm going to have to go with a 3-star rating.  I liked some things about the movie.  It's very different and quite interesting, but the acting doesn't hold up (and I honestly think the inclusion of Sylvia's character is one of the downfalls of the film), there are numerous plot holes and unanswered questions, and it's more of a sit-back-don't-think-and-just-enjoy type flick.  Don't expect too much from this.Overall: This movie definitely won't appeal to everyone.  I think the cons largely outweigh the pros in this case, but I sort of enjoyed watching it (sort of).  This wasn't a film I hated, and I didn't love it either.",3,Had potential...but,1330905600,"03 5, 2012",2012,6940,"['Time', 'presents', 'abnormal', 'futuristic', 'society', 'where', 'time', 'newest',

The story takes place in the distant future when adults stop aging at 25 but instead accrue time as currency.

I love this movie because of the idea it represents and the numerous questions it has left me asking myself since I finished it. In this film, time is controlled. The more time you have, the more wealthy you are. It is similar to our society but the downside of being lower-class comes with a far more dire consequence.There is a lot of action in here. Many chase scenes keep you on the edge of your seat while your mind is busy putting together pieces. You can't help but to try and figure out what will happen next, which makes the twists that the plot steers you through more unexpected. This is great because action scenes in thinking films keep them from growing dull while keeping your mind from overheating.The system is clever and it works. Once again, the movie is entirely plot-driven. The acting was also okay. I consider Justin Timberlake to be a solid actor, nothing more, nothing less. He is confident enough in his ability to take on any role, but I feel that he still has yet to ""own"" a character he portrays to the point of becoming a household name in acting. I feel that his reputation as an actor was gained entirely from his success as an entertainer. All of the supporting actors were suitable as well, which is fine, as this was never intended to be a character driven film.",5,Really Gets Your Mind Running,1327017600,"01 20, 2012",2012,1335,"['plot-driven', 'film', 'entirely', 'love', 'movie', 'idea', 'numerous', 'questions', 'left', 'asking', 'finished', 'film', 'time', 'controlled', 'more', 'time', 'have', 'more', 'wealthy', 'are', 'similar', 'society', 'downside', 'being', 'lower-class', 'far', 'more', 'dire', 'consequence.There', 'lot', 'action', 'here', 'Many', 'chase', 'scenes', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'mind', 'busy', 'putting', 'together', 'pieces', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'twists', 'plot', 'steers', 'more', 'unexpected', 'great', 'action', 'scenes', 'thinking', 'films', 'keep', 'growing', 'dull', 'keeping', 'mind', 'overheating.The', 'system', 'clever', 'Once', 'again', 'movie', 'entirely', 'plot-driven', 'acting', 'was', 'also', 'okay', 'consider', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'be', 'solid', 'actor', 'nothing', 'more', 'nothing', 'less', 'confident', 'enough', 'ability', 'take', 'role', 'feel', 'still', 'yet', 'own', 'character', 'point', 'becoming', 'household', 'name', 'acting', 'feel', 'reputation', 'actor', 'was', 'gained', 'entirely', 'success', 'entertainer', 'supporting', 'actors', 'were', 'suitable', 'as', 'well', 'fine', 'was', 'never', 'intended', 'be', 'character', 'driven', 'film']",In Time

While not exactly the same as that 1976 sci-fi hit, I found ""In Time"" to be highly entertaining. Niccol has a way with writing sci-fi that draws in the audience, making his underdog characters likeable and weaving a generally intriguing story. The cast is stellar but it is the story here that stands out.

1416130,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B004LWZW7E,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","I couldn't resist.  The film certainly didn't.  The script itself is plagued with so many `time' related clich&eacute;s within the dialog (can you spare a minute, etc.) that it was laughable, which is not something this film was shooting for.I honestly didn't mean to come on guns blazing in the first paragraph.  I'll lighten up for a second.`In Time' is a science fiction film about a future time when no one ages over twenty-five.  Sadly, you only actually LIVE till twenty-six unless you're rich.  The currency is time and so the more you owe the less you live.  In order to survive you have to work your fingers to the bone and conserve your `time'.  Will is twenty-eight and lives at home with his mother.  He is a minimum wage worker and his mother, who just turned fifty, works her fingers to the bone as well, and yet they are still living on mere hours, just trying to make enough to get to the next day.  After a bar brawl, Will winds up getting his hands on over a century of `time', but certain events lead him on the run with a beautiful socialite as Time Cops try to restore order by `cleaning Will's clock'.The idea is interesting.  I mean, it's not `really' interesting, but it could have been promising.  Instead, the film feels rather skeletal, with no real attempt to uncover any depth in the story.  Instead, it's a lot of running around and shooting and whatnot, which doesn't help differentiate this from any other random action thriller.  That, and Justin Timberlake is hard to take seriously.  It's his voice.  It is perfectly suited for the radio, and I happen to love me so `Sexyback' but the feminine nature of his voice makes it hard to take him seriously as an actor, unless his character benefits from that `pitch'.  It doesn't here.  It's not all Justin's fault though, as no one here really manages to deliver a decent performance.  I blame the script for that because these characters are just bland and uninspired.  The set pieces are nice and the editing is sharp so as to create some nicely placed action sequences (and when Will takes revenge on some thugs it was an inspired touch) but other than that this is a borderline bore of a film that never gets proper footing.",2,Time ran out...,1343606400,"07 30, 2012",2012,2208,"['could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'film', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'script', 'plagued', 'so', 'many', 'time', 'related', 'clich', 'eacute', 'dialog', 'can', 'spare', 'minute', 'etc', 'was', 'laughable', 'not', 'something', 'film', 'was', 'shooting', 'for.I', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'mean', 'come', 'guns', 'blazing', 'first', 'paragraph', ""'ll"", 'lighten', 'up', 'second.', 'Time', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'future', 'time', 'when', 'one', 'twenty-five', 'Sadly', 'only', 'actually', 'LIVE', 'till', 'twenty-six', ""'re"", 'rich', 'currency', 'time', 'so', 'more', 'owe', 'less', 'live', 'order', 'survive', 'have', 'work', 'fingers', 'bone', 'conserve', 'time', 'Will', 'twenty-eight', 'home', 'mother', 'minimum', 'wage', 'worker', 'mother', 'who', 'just', 'turned', 'fifty', 'fingers', 'bone', 'as', 'well', 'yet', 'are', 'still', 'living', 'mere', 'hours', 'just', 'trying', 'make', 'enough', 'get', 'next', 'day', 'bar', 'brawl', 'Will', 'up', 'getting', 'hands', 'century', 'time', 'certain', 'events', 'lead', 'run', 'beautiful', 'socialite', 'Time', 'Cops', 'try', 'restore', 'order', 'cleaning', 'Will', ""clock'.The"", 'idea', 'interesting', 'mean', 'not', 'really', 'interesting', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'promising', 'Instead', 'film', 'feels', 'rather', 'skeletal', 'real', 'attempt', 'uncover', 'depth', 'story', 'Instead', 'lot', 'running', 'around', 'shooting', 'whatnot', ""n't"", 'help', 'differentiate', 'other', 'random', 'action', 'thriller', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'hard', 'take', 'seriously', 'voice', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'radio', 'happen', 'love', 'so', 'Sexyback', 'feminine', 'nature', 'voice', 'hard', 'take', 'seriously', 'actor', 'character', 'benefits', 'pitch', ""n't"", 'here', 'not', 'Justin', 'fault', 'though', 'one', 'here', 'really', 'deliver', 'decent', 'performance', 'blame', 'script', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'bland', 'uninspired', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'nice', 'editing', 'sharp', 'so', 'create', 'nicely', 'placed', 'action', 'sequences', 'when', 'Will', 'revenge', 'thugs', 'was', 'inspired', 'touch', 'other', 'borderline', 'bore', 'film', 'never', 'proper', 'footing']",In Time
1416131,A1EVD37ULFNOKU,B004LWZW7E,"Andrew Frankel ""Huge movie collector""","[0, 0]","The movie was ok. I think the concept is great but the script lacks in intensity and has low character development. Do I recommend it: probably to the right people, but to the majority no. Watch it when you can for free and make up your own mind. I wrote a lot below to describe a bit more. But to be fair I am writing this at 4am, so I may ramble a bit.I really wanted more from this movie. The first 20 minutes were fantastic. Then it goes, as others reviewed would call it, &#34;Spiraling out of control&#34;. People are paid with time. Once your time runs out on your arm clock you die. People can stay immortal as long as their clock never runs out. Poor people die quicker than rich people. You have Districts that contain different classes of people based on their time allotments. Justin Timberlake's character (Will) starts in the &#34;Ghetto&#34; and has a &#34;mission&#34; of destroying the gap of all the districts. Thats the premise and it's seems interesting enough and if it is done well, the story could be really good. Problems:1. They introduced a lot of Characters that could have been very strong, but were so underdeveloped that they left you in the dark. Everyone had a potentially intertwined story that could have been really interesting, but someone decided not to write.2. Sylvia Weis (Seyfried) was a hot mess. Her character went from weak to confused, and back to weak again, with moments of trying to be a badass. And to top it off the character really didn't need to be part of the movie.3. The Time Keepers...If there is a camera showing Will at the scene, surely there was footage of Henry going there on his own and dying on his own.4. Our first trip through the districts were made to seem like it was this whole expensive and long journey, but afterwards they travel from end to end like it was right next door. And do you only need to pay one way?5. The ghetto should have been more like a ghetto. And I am sorry, but how does 1 man with a posse of 4 run an entire district even after everyone gets free time. And how does he not know what is going on.6. Running away from the Time Keepers, but you make sure to stop and look back directly at them to give a stupid one-liner. What the hell. You are running away, RUN AWAY!7. The flipping convertible. I am sorry you both would be dead.8. If you have 2 people that you want to steal from and you are a group of 4, why are 3 of you waiting for 1 person to steal. Wouldn't all of you do it, it is more efficient.9. When you both look at your clocks with 1 minute to spare and counting, the whole stopping to say goodbye and giving a kiss seems a little drawn out. No urgency to the fact you both will be dead. I would have preferred a Shakespearian ending.10. Cillian Murphy - The end was a cop out.11. Really, 1,000,000 years. How about no more CLOCKS!Pros:Justin Timberlake did a pretty good job with this even though he was given some crappy lines. Someone did not edit the script properly.The movie editing surprisingly was pretty good. Except for the eye rolling lines every 10 minutes or so, the pace was well done.THE SOUNDTRACK is the best.

1416133,A3HP7JU4ZORF52,B004LWZW7E,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"[1, 1]","In Time is a science fiction thriller about a future world where scientists have managed to turn off the aging gene making everyone unaging, to avoid massive over population a system is put into place where everyone is born with a timer on their right arm, once a person turn 25 years old they stop aging and the timer start counting down one year, one the timer runs out the person dies. Now in this world time is currency, the lower class is working to earn another day of life, everything is paid for with hours and minutes, and then you have a rich upper class who live in luxury and literary have all the time in the world making them immortal. The main character is a poor man named Will Salas who after a chance encounter with a suicidal but rich man end up with over 100 years of life and a knowledge of how corrupt the whole system realty is. Will off course soon meet a beautiful woman, the rich man's daughter Sylvia who share his idea on the unfairness of the system. The rest of the movie is part a modern time Robin Hood story and part social commentary about social inequality.In Time have a great concept. In many ways the story is very similar to the Jack Vance novel To Live Forever, the idea of s dystopian future where people's lives are used as currency is interesting and draw you into the story. I love the way time is transferred between people as they only need to touch one another's arms, this create a distance between people as everyone is always afraid of having their time stolen. I also like the world building, how we get a good look at what life must be like in this society, Science Fiction is all about asking what if, what if this technology where part of human society, how would it change us? In time both asks that question and then explores it well. The time as currency aspect is well developed and presented in a credible and detailed way.One problem with the movie however is that the world of In Time looks exactly like ours, I mean this film is set a couple of hundred years into the future. Now I do not expect them to have flying cars and robots, but you would suspect technology had developed some at least. Now I get it, the people in a position to develop new technologies are immortal so it would probably be some slowdown as no one would be in a hurry to get something done, but there have to have been some changes in 200+ years, even fashion is mostly the same. This was something which made it hard for me to suspend disbelief that this future would where exactly like our own except for people not aging and buying and selling time to live. Another thing I found unrealistic was the time zones, basically you have several cities with roadblocks between them to keep the rich and the poor separated, the problem is that there is 12 or so timezones and each zone seam to be the size of a city or so, ok but where is the rest of America, not to mention the rest of the world? Do they use the same system? Do they age, have they stopped aging and just let people live forever if they want? Do they use another system? None of this is even addressed in the movie. The would of In Time is completely limited to the 12 or so time zones and outside of that everything is a complete blank, something which is a little hard to buy.The acting in In Time is passable, you will find nothing fantastic here, the emotional scenes can seam a bit lacking which make it hard to care about the character, but for the action segment the actors get the job done. The music in this movie works to set the mood for the scenes it is in but it is forgettable. The camera work is quite ok. The characters in this movie is rather good, yes they are stereotypes, but they are well crafted versions of the stereotypes they are based on.I enjoyed In Time, it was an entertaining movie.

It's obviously a heavy handed metaphor for the evils of Capitalism:  what won't the rich co-opt next?  Here, it's time.  So it's not bloody and not terribly acted, though it isn't well acted, either.My analysis would lie in large part with the dialogue.  It's lame and stiff.  Now, the director may have made that decision because the society of the era is lame and stiff, but to trot out some old English class stuff, it's ""mimetic fallacy.""  Meaning that, in my weak paraphrase, using the flaws (in this case) to reflect the flaws ...  well, it's not compelling stuff.  I think the film would have been better with stronger dialogue from at least one of the characters.  Being vacuous is not really revealing the vacuous.I also felt that the use of my town was pretty lame and cliched.  Take the River, for instance.  At least there were no giant ants coming out of tunnels.  But it's not technically where we're at with the River these days.  There was just this typical dystopian feel about the whole set design that annoyed me, it was just way too cliched, but that is a personal predilection.  The romantic sub plot is superfluous and not at all earned from anything else.  And, to parrot a prior reviewer, I really didn't much care about the romantic feelings anyway.  I got more honest emotion out of ""Cowboys and Aliens,"" and that's pretty faint praise.So I don't think this is a good film.  But it's always easy to criticize from the laptop.  At least the team got the job done, and for that, they deserve respect, if not fanfare.  Sincerity counts.  And craft raises sincerity to art.My thinking.

The rich have time in abundance and can live forever, the poor struggle daily. Unfortunately this movie - instead of playing with this very unique concept - quickly dissolves into some silly critique of capitalism with the message being that it's OK to steal from the rich 'because they stole it first' which seems to become the prevailing attitude in our society. The rich and successful are evil...In the third act the two protagonists simply resort to stealing time and distributing it trying to bring the system down, ignoring their previous correct epiphany that whatever time they steal and donate the establishment simply will raise prices to restore equilibrium.I'll set aside the obvious flaws about how easy it is to transfer time from one individual to another w/o any safeguards imagine debit cards w/o pin codes for one account that holds all your money w/o any withdrawal limits and no traceability of who took your money BUT wouldn't it have been way more interesting a premise to work on a solution to disable the clock to bring the system down, or manipulate he clock to give everybody unlimited time? Instead our two protagonist just head over to the next bank to steal more time, which will ultimately lead to their certain demise.I'd rate the first act of the movie 5 stars, the second 3 and the ludicrous  third act 1 star.

Case in point, the part where Will Salas and his mother were running towards each other, great scene by the way, went horribly wrong at the end. Editor and director of photography botched it. Scene lost the crucial emotional impact it could have delivered and made a worthwhile cause seem fabricated. At the very least, show us Will's agony of losing his mother right in front of him, mere steps away, show us his mother's expression as she fell in the final second. Then there's the swim in the ocean scene, the bank robbing scene, the kiss in back of the car scene, the list goes on. Watch those scenes and tell me if they do not feel flat to you.It was only after the movie ended and the credits began rolling that I realized it was done by Andrew Niccol, this is the guy responsible for the brilliantly fantastic Gattaca, one of the most underrated, way ahead of its time movie.

1416166,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B004LWZW7E,Chris Kennison,"[10, 16]","""IN TIME"" is a science fiction escapism film that is set in a time and place where money is no longer the currency, but time. Strange as it may seem, the whole thing felt like a really well done and extended version of a ""Twilight Zone"" episode. In an alternate dimension, time and place, wealth is about how much time you have accumulated. The wealthiest of the people can be immortal while the poorest are accustom to waking up each day with 24 hours or even less left on their time ticker and everyone looks to be in their mid-twenties.I'm pretty sure that the creators of ""In Time"" were fully aware of the parallels they were exploring with time being what we knows as money and as a fewer, those parallels hit home with me. The poor struggle from day to day to add to their life and to make it to the next sunrise by working thankless jobs and doing whatever it takes to survive as long as they can. The poor live a life of urgency as if the slightest mistake could end their lives. Meanwhile, the rich rush nowhere. They aren't worried about anything. They have control over their lives and how long they will live. Most of them will live forever.Justin Timberlake capably plays ghetto regular Will Salas, who has a robin hood type persona, always ready to give up a little of his minutes to help out somebody who's in more need. This personality trait gets him a gift of 100 years and naturally, he moves away from the ghetto, where 100 years could get him killed by somebody wanting his time, to the upscale Greenwich where he meets Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried). Weis is the daughter of the man who holds all the cards, or time.As the story plays out, ""In Time"" becomes a mix of ""Bonnie & Clyde"" meets ""Robin Hood"" and you definitely buy into the reasoning behind their plight.""In Time"" is rich with creativity and sucks you in with skillful storytelling. The depth of its rich story reminded me of the creativity that went into the concepts surrounding ""The Matrix"" movie series. It isn't anywhere near as groundbreaking as the original ""Matrix"" movie was, but the same suspend belief and enjoy the ride is in place. At times the writing is outstanding and at times the writing is lackluster. At times the direction and settings are creative and entertaining and sometimes cheap and poorly staged.""In Time"" could have been better had it been more polished in certain areas, but it is by no means a deal breaker. It is certainly a movie that people who love quality science fiction in the tradition of the ""Twilight Zone"" or movies of the 70s will enjoy. It isn't a special effects extravaganza and that's part of the reason why I enjoyed it so much. It isn't trying to bribe people into liking it.

1416168,A35FC3DWA1M79H,B004LWZW7E,Christopher,"[1, 1]","I, like most had seen the trailer for this in theaters and put this on my ""must see"" list!  I did not make it to see this in the theaters and I am kind of glad that I did not.This film had a good concept which of course is based on current events like the 1% vs. the 99% - the very greedy haves vs. the have-nots/can't let them get!  This film is clearly and overt political film which should have been more covert in order to truly get it's point across.  This film touches on the mega rich vs. the poor and how the mega rich not only keep the poor down and away from them, but they also make sure that they can never achieve anything in life - unless allowed by the mega rich!  It is art imitating life - albeit financed by the 1%!The idea of the film is that time is used as currency to determine how long you are to live.  The more that you make, the longer you live.  The more you make, the more things that you can do.  Of course in real life, the more that you make the more that you can do and the longer you CAN live due to better health care and other factors.  There is no paper money or anything called money it is just time that you deal with.  Of course the mega rich horde all of the time for themselves and they could care less who has any.The film takes place in a place called Dayton - although we can clearly see the Los Angeles skyline in the background!  That is the ghetto, and there is the wealthy suburb of ""New Greenwich"" which I assume is supposed to be a place like Greenwich, CT where the mega rich live and they do what they can to keep ""others"" out of the town and they know instantly if you do not `belong' there!The scope of the film was large, but the execution was small.  I do not know if this is due to the budget, the producer's vision of the limited L.A. scenery, but the film does not LOOK good!  It takes place 150 years from now, but it looks like it takes place 50 years ago!  150 years from now and they ride in cars from the 80's, 60's and 70's?  I guess that is a part of the budget.  I also hate it when films that take place in the future always have the same look with the long coat cops and plain vehicles.I know that parts of this future are based on what many say people are planning which includes biochips (available), population reduction (so that the rich will have less challengers), economic collapse (to make people rebel so that they can be killed), increasing the cost of living while keeping pay the same and a police state!  I hope those are not the plans because that would be a foolish thing to do for the US.  This film touches on it but the setting, look and ""futuristic"" design do not translate well in 2011/2012 given that things look a lot better now.  They should have spent more or chosen a different city to film in and it should have been done iRobot style.The BD picture quality is of course A1 since this is a new release and they are not really going to look bad most times.  This is something to see, but not anything to buy.  Timberlake's acting is not too bad if you keep in mind that he was a signer first.

It may have looked interesting but the movie itself has got to be one of the worst movies ever! The acting is terrible with the exception of Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins, Inception, and Red Eye). I thought that Justin Timberlake just wasn't believable. For example, He showed emotions but they were the wrong emotions for the wrong scenes. (SPOILER ALERT)When Will's mom died it looked like he was laughing instead of crying. In another scene where he's talking to Sylvia he says how he will make them (The Rich) pay for the loss of his mom. That line alone is just a hilarious line(Unintentionally) worthy of being in a comedy, not a so-called sci-fi thriller. Also let me talk about the action. The action sequences were few with the few shootouts (and an unbelievably fake car crash) that there were looked cheesy due to the fact that the guns looked unbelievably fake. I might also add to the fact that in one scene Will Salas says that he wants to balance out the system so that the poor are just like the rich. He's saying that he wants everybody to be equal. Know what does that sound like to you.  You guessed it Communism. So in conclusion Andrew Niccol (The Director, Writer, and producer) put in his movie recipe communism, a dash of socialism, cheesy looking guns, bad acting(except for Cillian), and of course some sexual situations, and some strong language.

But is it is a one-note song and that note gets so overused that monotony sets in.The official description of the story is as follows: in a future where people stop aging at 25, but are engineered to live only one more year, having the means to buy your way out of the situation is a shot at immortal youth. Here, Will Salas finds himself accused of murder and on the run with a hostage - a connection that becomes an important part of the way against the system.'  Plug into this simplistic explanation the fact that Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) lives in a time zone equivalent to living on the wrong side of the tracks. He decides to go for the gold and with the help of his buddy Borel (Johnny Galecki) he sets out to cross through all the barriers (using his allotted stored time to buy passage) to get to the wealthy part of town - an area run by the Timekeeper (Cillian Murphy) and his staff (Alex Pettyfer et at).  Will gains entry into the gambling casinos, bets his hours on Timekeeper at the table, wins, and meets the beautiful Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried), daughter of the richest man in the city.  From there on it is a `catch me if you can' chase as Will and Sylvia try to outwit the Timekeeper and of course we know who is going to survive.The dialogue is plebian, the characters, with the possible exception of Will, are only given to us in outline form, so we end up not really caring about anyone.  There are some interesting bits of surrealism tossed in but even those can't alter the fact that there is very little to work with in this little star turn for Timberlake.

1416211,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B004LWZW7E,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 4]","Tempus fugit, bro. The movie title is lame but the premise is nifty and thought-provoking. I had to double check to make sure that Philip K. Dick didn't write this. But, no, Andrew Niccol penned the story and then shrugged and directed it, as well. Sometime in the near future, some messed up genius has figured out a way to genetically engineer the human body to halt the aging process once it attains 25 years. The catch is that once you reach 25, you're left with only a year to live. A digital clock activates on your forearm, begins to count down your last year of living. Except that there's a method by which you can add time to your body clock. In a world in which time has become currency, you can work for it, get paid in increments of  time. You can choose to barter an hour of your life for ten minutes of heaven with a lady of the evening. A call on a pay phone costs one minute, a bus ride an hour. In this reality, ""Tempus fugit"" has a horrific connotation.One way to ascertain class status is by how leisurely or frantically someone is going about their business. In the ghetto district inhabited by Will Salas (Timberlake), people frequently eye their built-in clocks, frequently run during their errands. In the ghetto, people don't have time to kill, but they will murder for time. If you get caught napping, thieves can literally steal time from you. When the puzzled heiress wonders how people in the ghetto live like this, Will remarks, ""People don't much sleep in."" Phrases such as ""Don't waste my time"" or ""Do you have a minute?"" take on whole new breadths of meaning.In this new world order, the gulf dividing the haves and have-nots has expanded exponentially. The rich can simply amass centuries' worth of time and, in essence, become immortal whereas the poverty-stricken desperately scramble to earn enough time to make it thru the day, sometimes thru the next hour. Will Salas is 28 years old (or ""25 + 3""). When a mysterious man (Matt Bomer) bequeathes Will Salas his century of life and then promptly commits suicide - in the parlance of the day, he ""times out"" - Will is suspected of murdering his benefactor. Because who would give away a century of life? Enter Cillian Murphy as the relentless head Timekeeper, the near future's version of law enforcement.What do you do when you suddenly have a hundred years' worth of time? You skedaddle from the ghetto and crash New Greenwich, where the influential and the deep pockets dwell, is what. We track Will Salas' arc as he goes from ghetto factory worker to determined outlaw, fighting to effect a change. A key component to his transformation is his brush with Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried), the sheltered 27-year-old (""25 + 2"") daughter of New Greenwich's wealthiest business mogul. (There's an even more crucial development which fuels Will's anti-establishment rage, but that might really be spoilering it - but you'll see it coming.) Sylvia Weis is one of them idle rich kids what has bodyguards trailing her, and she suffers from sheer ennui brought about by a lifetime bout of entitlement. You can imagine that spark of interest when she set eyes on Will, someone trying to blend - but not quite making it - into her rarified universe. The story applies an age-old plot device to throw Will and Sylvia together. Throw in the Timekeepers, and Will's decision to go down that dark road, and things suddenly take a Bonnie & Clyde turn but with a Robin Hood twist.Carpe tempus, or something. Will's crusade to parcel out time to those in need has unintended consequences. He didn't plan on the lowlifes to start preying on those what just got free time handed to them. And, to play devil's advocate, it turns out, there's a checks and balances system in play. With immortality achievable, overpopulation is stringently kept at bay by the government's continuous price hikes and the taxes reflect this. Places like the ghettos are heavily impacted; the death toll evens the scales. So how righteous is Will's cause, really? His mantra is ""Is it stealing if it's already stolen?"" But maybe it sounds a bit too self-serving.In this one Justin Timberlake isn't as locked in as he was in THE SOCIAL NETWORK, but he still has that big presence. IN TIME is a high concept sci-fi thriller, except that it knows that it's high concept. The metaphors fly thick and obvious. The allegory is transparent. The story is approached in a heavy-handed way. Timberlake and Seyfried are good together, but this is in spite of some laborious dialogue. So part of the film dragged for me. But there came a time when Amanda Seyfried's character was finally allowed to step out of her bored shell. Timberlake, scalp and jawline stubbled like all good action heroes should, does pretty well with the action sequences. All these nice good elements convince me to rate this sucker a better than average 3 out of 5 stars. It'd be higher but for those slow bits to slog thru and that whiff of stuffiness and that there isn't one truly knock-it-out-of-the-park moment in the film (although Timberlake and Pettyfer's time duel in the swanky hotel room comes close). So go.

1416220,A27W5AJNP6YX7Z,B004LWZW7E,"Ivy Bewley ""Hiedra""","[0, 0]","I found that this movie left a lot to be desired (I agree with many of the flaws other reviewers commented on) but I still think it deserves 4 stars because of the social commentary prevalent throughout the plot. The world is such a hard place to live in, and the division between the rich and poor is disastrous. What made this movie so compelling is that, when time is the currency instead of paper money (or credit), everything becomes even more desperate. When the rent or some other bill is due and you don't have the time to pay for it, you don't owe someone or go into the red. You die. It really makes the concept of ""running out"" much more clear.One thing I found disturbing was the huge group of people that quit their jobs when they suddenly ""came into"" currency. One, if they're that irresponsible and spontaneous, they probably won't budget their time very well. Two, a good number of rich or well-off people think if they can make it, anyone can. And that is just not true. There always has to be someone left to do the menial, ""unskilled"" jobs. SOMEONE has to clean and do the dishes. Even millionaires' homes would become landfills if there were no garbage collectors. How could they buy the things they wanted without cashiers? They would starve without farmers. (I don't even want to mention those poor people who work in sanitation plants.) That is why EVERYONE deserves a living wage. Screw the minimum wage.And that's why this movie was so fascinating. People treated time exactly the way people currently treat money. Nothing had changed. The behavior of the rich hadn't changed. A good number of them went about their frivolous lifestyles having no idea what goes on on the other side of the tracks. The behavior of the poor hadn't changed. They worked day in and day out and never got ahead.I think the movie could have been more detailed and brought up a few more issues. Like most people, I think the way they ""transferred"" time was way too simplistic. Being able to steal someone's time simply by grabbing their hand is just silly. It made picking a pocket seem difficult. That was definitely the biggest flaw of the movie. I really didn't like what happened to the mother of the main character either.

1416221,A26YFGY8BDEN2U,B004LWZW7E,Jack Young,"[5, 12]","It is an excellent show. If you like shows like Matrix 2, you will like this.This is going to be a slightly ""weird"" review. I am not going to comment on how the characters have acted or how their lives flowed in the ""new world order"" they were in. You can read those in other reviews or just watch this nice movie yourself to find out.I find the show's ""new world order"" intriguing and will comment more on that.GENERAL CONTEXTThe show portrayed a ""new world order"" where people are genetically engineered to stop aging once they reached 25 years. From there you must earn every seconds or year of your living and the entire economy is transacted using time as cash. The world was split into different zones.Those who are rich with time (i.e. ""cash"") are in the same zone, while those who are poor were grouped in the ghetto zone. Those in the ghetto zone were the labourers producing things and living from day-to-day, if not seconds-to-seconds. Once you have run out of time, you died.As time became the transactional medium, those without enough time would never get to enjoy the fruits of the labour they have produced. Its most likely beyond their reach as the fruits were too expensive (sounds familiar?). In any case, the labourers died as they have ran out of time.You see in this show, the price of basic necessities kept inflating and hence more and more time were used to pay the bills, while the time wages (esp in the ghetto) either remained static or were reduced.The show had a mantle: ""For a few to remain immortal, many must die. So in this case, it triggered one to think, ""For few to live well, others must die"" due to the scarcity of resources.THOUGHTS ON PLOTGranted that Immortality is what everyone craves for. As stated above, the show took on the genetically engineered future where Immortality was achieved.From there the prescient plot mashed well on the ""new world order"" of immortality that functioned in the instinctive Darwinism of humans where it kept quoting ""Survival of the fittest"" (In my view, it's the ""Survival of the smartest""), and alongside the competitive nature of Capitalism in us, under an environment with scarce resources.It tackled well how were people going to die, given that the limited world resources cannot support an immortal world where the population could expand infinitely (without death).With the introduction of time as a transactional currency, and inflation lurking to ""kill of the poorer population"" by inflating them to run out of time, it resulted in a working capitalism system which naturally climaxed on the loop-sided case where the winners took all (the time) and achieved the rights to immortality.From this, it gave Death a positive spin and showed a meaning in the greater cycle of things. Through death, one was able to make way for others (with changes coming about) and through death, one can better treasured one's time on earth to accomplish something. To quote from the show ""Why do it now, when you can do it a hundred years later"".Every systems functioning in the name of Capitalism probably needed a reset when the winners were too well established, for the purest and rawest form of capitalism to return. That was where the revolution (and our hero) came in with the ""fight club"" moment to overthrow/reset the Order.To wrap up, I now touch on abit on other aspects of the show. The 2 lead characters of the show. Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried have chemistry as a couple. Both looked and acted well, as do the rest of the cast. And truly, kudos to Justin for taking on this project. If only the marketing for this show had been better, it may reach the status of zen-like show like Matrix.If I may say, it's a sci-fi cult. I don't normally give 5 stars because I believe there's always much rooms for improvement. But for this show, in terms of how the refreshing plot and the characters comes about, I think a full 5 stars.Can't wait to buy the DVD and see the extras in it.........MINI SPOILERThis scene somehow stood out. Will Salas's (Justin Timeberlake) mum Rachael Salas (played by Olivia Wilde) was having her 50th birthday. But as Will cannot even afford the time go eat a decent breakfast, his mum transferred 30 minutes to have his breakfast.Later in the evening she went to the bank to pay 2 days time worth of loan. She was planning to take a bus from the bank to meet Will for a birthday dinner after the loan payment. But she only had 1.5 hours of time left in her life, while the bus ride inflated from 1 hour to 2 hour.She couldn't afford the ride and could only run to the dinning place. When Will (flushed with time at that point) didn't meet her at the stipulated time, he ran towards the bank's direction to find her. Will's mum life expired in a matter of seconds before Will could reach her and transfer time to extend her life. She died in his arm.It stuck in my mind that in stark contrast, the 30 minutes that Will's mum gave him in the morning may have ultimately cost her life in the cut-throat inflationary environment they were in.",5,New World Order (Darwinism with Immortality),1322352000,"11 27, 2011",2011,5052,"['excellent', 'show', 'like', 'shows', 'Matrix', '2', 'will', 'like', 'this.This', 'going', 'be',

1416229,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B004LWZW7E,Jason,"[2, 4]","In this dystopian tale, Will Salas (Timberlake) has little time to live.  Literally.  His personal timer - begun for all on their 25th birthday - displays vividly on his forearm.  In this Brave New World with day-glow countdowns, most people scratch and claw their way through life and work to accumulate more currency in the form of time.  Time pays for everything with an expiration date: eggs, milk, and even life.  So when Will runs into Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer), a rich man flaunting his time around at a seedy bar in the ghetto, he intervenes to save Hamilton from a murderous Minuteman (i.e. time thief) played excellently by  Alex Pettyfer.  The old man, deciding he has had enough of life, essentially commits suicide by gifting all of his time to Will, creating a situation where Will can simultaneously serve as a Timex Robin Hood, dishing out time to all he deems deserving, and upwardly mobile revenge-seeker.  In this latter role, Will encounters aristocrat Phillipe Weis (Karheiser) and his cute daughter Sylvia (Seyfried).  It's no surprise the opposites of Will and Sylvia connect - he throws caution to the wind while she takes no risks with her eternal lifetime.  Ultimately the age-old battle against ""the man"" ensues, where Cillian Murphy awkwardly chases Will and Sylvia before the combo create communistic chronicity.What struck me while watching this film is internet joke regarding money, women, and time that holds true for Will's encounters with the fairer sex.Women require time and moneyThe old Ben Franklin saying, ""Time is money.""A little math gives us: Women = (Money) * 2The mistransliteration of the Old Testament tells us ""Money is the root of all problems.""Therefore, Women=Problems.Overall the film is well executed, but a little underwhelming.  The protagonist is perhaps the worst actor in the film, and his beautiful sidekick is probably not even in the top 5 of beauties in this film.

At the age of 25 they stop aging but a timing system only gives them 1 more year to live.  To get more time they have to work hard and they get compensated with time as currency. Everyone looks 25 but in reality they can be well over 100 years old with thousands of years more time on their biological clocks.Everything you want is paid with minutes, hours, days or years of lifespan.  Unfortunately the same establishment that gives you time payment for your work also keeps raising the cost of living (cost of living has a new meaning now doesn't it).  Prices seem to go up every day.  It is a method of population control.Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) and his mom live day to day just barely having enough time left to survive each day.  A stranger who Will saves gives Will over 100 years of time leaving only 5 minutes to himself because he wants to die.  When Will realizes what has happened he plans to meet his mom to share the time and rejoice.The story leads to Will seeking vengeance for such a ruthless system when he realizes that the rich can be immortal while the poor live day to day in fear.  He meets Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried) whose father is a timer broker and together they figure out how to get justice and share the life time currency with those who really need it.This movie has a great premise and has several analogies with the rich and poor in the world today.  Can you imagine knowing the time of your death and being helpless to prevent it?  Unfortunately the movie that could have been great falls short on several issues.  Two people with no criminal history are making daring robberies and stealing the most precious commodity in the world while millions just passively face death every day.With a better script and perhaps an underground movement to support them, this movie could have been a lot better.  Expecting two people to save millions is a little over the top.I gave the movie 4 stars as it was entertaining but the potential was so much more.Nobody should live forever!",4,"Futuristic Robin Hoods, rob from the rich and give to the poor!",1329177600,"02 14, 2012",2012,2138,"['review', 'spoilers', '+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Mankind', 'been', 'genetically', 'altered', 'age', '25', 'stop', 'aging', 'timing', 'system', 'only', '1', 'more', 'year', 'live', 'get', 'more', 'time', 'have', 'work', 'hard', 'get', 'compensated', 'time', 'currency', 'Everyone', '25', 'reality', 'can', 'be', 'well', '100', 'years', 'old', 'thousands', 'years', 'more', 'time', 'biological', 'clocks.Everything', 'want', 'paid', 'minutes', 'hours', 'days', 'years', 'lifespan', 'Unfortunately', 'same', 'establishment', 'time', 'payment', 'work', 'also', 'raising', 'cost', 'living', 'cost', 'living', 'new', 'meaning', 'now', ""n't"", 'Prices', 'seem', 'go', 'up', 'day', 'method', 'population', 'control.Will', 'Salas', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'mom', 'live', 'day', 'day', 'just', 'barely', 'having', 'enough', 'time', 'left', 'survive', 'day', 'A', 'stranger', 'who', 'Will', 'Will', '100', 'years', 'time', 'leaving', 'only', '5', 'minutes', 'die', 'When', 'Will', 'what', 'happened', 'meet', 'mom', 'share', 'time', 'rejoice.The', 'story', 'Will', 'seeking', 'vengeance', 'ruthless', 'system', 'when', 'rich', 'can', 'be', 'immortal', 'poor', 'live', 'day', 'day', 'fear', 'Sylvia', 'Weis', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'father', 'timer', 'broker', 'together', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'get', 'justice', 'share', 'life', 'time', 'currency', 'who', 'really', 'need', 'it.This', 'movie', 'great', 'premise', 'several', 'analogies', 'rich', 'poor', 'world', 'today', 'Can', 'imagine', 'knowing', 'time', 'death', 'being', 'helpless', 'prevent', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'short', 'several', 'issues', 'Two', 'people', 'criminal', 'history', 'are', 'making', 'daring', 'robberies', 'stealing', 'most', 'precious', 'commodity', 'world', 'millions', 'just', 'passively', 'face', 'death', 'day.With', 'better', 'script', 'perhaps', 'underground', 'movement', 'support', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'Expecting', 'two', 'people', 'save', 'millions', 'little', 'top.I', 'gave', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'was', 'entertaining', 'potential', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'more.Nobody', 'should', 'live', 'forever']",In Time

This movie, &#34;In Time&#34;  has an interesting and unique story line.  In the future, traditional money is replaced with time units.  Everyone is given a certain amount of time and aging stops at 25.  This situation forces people to do whatever they can to steal, inherit or borrow more time to stay alive.  Like a lot of science fiction movies that have come out lately, the writers just cannot make a film without demonizing the evil corporations  (Those dirty, filthy capitalists theme myth), and glorifying socialism and big government.  The scenes of living on the poor side of town seems to be a favorite but familiar story, as the rich and powerful live in luxury with plenty of time to spend, the poor side struggle to survive after age 25. The answer, of course, is time distribution (replaces the old socialist false premise of &#34;wealth distribution.&#34;) for all people.Even though I did not like the unoriginal &#34;capitalism bad and socialism is good&#34;  basic theme; nevertheless,  the acting by these new performers, Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried, in this film is good and there is quite a bit of interesting action scenes.

The passage of time is utterly unrealistic, with characters repeatedly running distances of several hundred yards in mere seconds. A nearly two-hour sprint is not enough to cause one of the characters to break a sweat.Poor dialogue causes frequent chuckling throughout serious scenes. As an example, in one scene, after a few minutes of running together, one character stops, says ""follow me to the other,"" then resumes running.The acting is not strong, but it isn't laughable. Quite frankly, I expected worse out of Justin Timberlake, but he held up okay in this role.

1416245,A1WUCPUBJ6O2NZ,B004LWZW7E,Justin Blade,"[11, 18]","First off, be clear that this film unashamedly states that its time economy system is actually ""Darwinist Capitalism"", quoted from Weis; the million year man, although there is nothing free-market or capitalist about it as in the film they can apparently just raise prices and no other business/person steps in to compete by selling the same goods for less, pushing back down prices. No, this film with all it's ridiculously preachy anti-capitalism and cliched lines is really about the danger of a big government who has the power to control markets, business and people be it big socialist/open society or fascist (tho I'm sure the maker of this film would vehemently disagree). Other times this film is simply ridiculous with its glaring plot holes and unbelievable moments. Examples include: 1. They meet a roadblock of at least 12 armed men with automatic weapons and drive pass and through all of them unscathed 2. Apparently while noone ever ages due to genetic engineering, everyone dies of what looks like heart failure when the clock on their arm runs out, but the film never goes into any real depth explaining why and since it's stopped when they transfer this ""time"" why doesn't anyone go create more of the stuff that's stopping death and solve the problem or if it's a programmed death (as one can infer), why don't the protagonists/others go get the death gene removed/fixed? But no that would apparently ruin the painfully flawed premise and strongly anti-capitalist tone and metaphors if one introduces logic and the fact that in a capitalist/free market system some entrepreneur would invest to start a business to find, create and sell a cure and customers would buy the cheapest, most effective cure offered. The constant preachiness throughout the film is grating but don't just take my word or interpretation, read some of the quotes as they are: ""This is merely survival of the fittest - Darwinist Capitalism. Natural Selection"" by Weis, ""I worked out how to escape"" Leon ""and now you want to make sure no one else does"" Salas, ""All they have to do is keep raising the cost of living"" Salas (you know government printing money, raising taxes and burdensome regulations might have alot more to do with this than ""evil"" businesses), ""Does everyone from the ghetto steal?"" Sylvia ""Oh that's rich coming from you! Let me guess, now you like the idea of sharing?"" Salas (the rich got so by offering goods/services of value that people decided to buy, when did that become stealing? - only if capitalism ceases and government forces people to buy a product or service / prevents other companies from competing), ""He was killed for giving away what he won... for giving them hope"" Salas, ""Taxes and prices go up so people keep dying. How else could there be men with a million years when most live day to day?"" Hamilton, ""If you guys are looking for stolen time you should arrest everyone here!"" Salas (at fancy party), ""For a few to be immortal, many must die"" Weis (the rich generally do not become rich by stealing from or killing their customers, but creating something that will improve people's lives / people want). And sick justifications for robbing people and banks to give to some other person like ""Is it stealing if its already stolen?"" and ""Don't think of it as stealing, think of it as repossession"" Salas.

1416250,AZD18Z3FWGAKY,B004LWZW7E,Kevin,"[0, 0]","In Time focuses on the future, where the world has decided to remove the gene that causes people to age. As a means to control this, you stop aging at 25 years old and they you will leave one more year unless you earn more time. Time though is also the currency of this era buying things such as coffee, hotel rooms, and meals. Overall, I loved the concept of In Time and was intrigued from the very beginning. While the concept is very interesting, there are a number of flaws which while not a deal breaker, frustrated me as a viewer such as in a world trying to avoid anarchy, the simplicity of transferring time by touch seems a bit to...simple. Maybe that's just me though. In addition, a few questions are raised that are never answered, and secondary character development is lacking making what could have been a fantastic, robust and believable world a bit cold and confusing. With that said, I enjoyed the premise and the movie. I just wish that more time had been put into it's crafting to take full advantage of the great premise at hand.While the film suffered from a few issues, the technical aspects of the film were nice when presented on Blu-Ray. The movie's colors and representation of fleshtones, clarity, etc. were all spot on for the environments the characters were in. The night scenes featured a nice amount of detail on the buildings and in the shadows, lending to the believability of the film.The soundtrack, DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, was nice and took advantage of all of the speakers. Great off camera cues, spatial dimension and subtle effects made this an overall involving audio mix. The film took advantage of the subwoofer occasionally to create solid, deep, and powerful bass. While much of the film did not require this, it was well done when used. The dialogue was solid and at a good volume in relation to the other effects.Parents, I would personally peg the movie for a 13 year old, depending on the family. There is some profanity (f word, some s words, etc.), some sexual content involving skinny dipping, There is also plenty of violence, some suicide, and more. While much of this is bloodless, it is something to consider if violence is a concern. There is also some drinking but there is not any use of drugs.Overall, I really enjoyed In Time. While it suffered from plot flaws and basic premise issues, the film was fun and brought a new concept forward that differed nicely from the average sci-fi film. I wish more time had been spent on this and developing the other characters, but all flaws considered, I would happily watch the movie again as I feel it plays a nice commentary on modern day america, the constant struggle for life, and the class structure.

It's your usual ""evil rich guys have too much and everyone else is oppressed.""  Now, I get that some people here might really buy into that message, but even if that's your thing then this is the most transparently-done version of that message.  It's like they figured that everyone watching this was some junior high kid wearing their brand-new silk-screened Che Guevara 50th Anniversary Limited Edition T-shirt and getting ready for some revolution against the machine.  So they had to beat you over the head relentlessly with how bad it is to have too much time/money.  Point is, there's nothing subtle or elegant going on here, regardless of your political leanings.Second of all, there's nothing new here.  You want to know the entire movie?  Here it is: rich girl is upset at being rich, then she gets thrown in with noble poor guy, they do a ""Bonnie & Clyde"" and everyone loves them.  Roll credits.  You'd have to be about six years old to believe the plot holes in this movie.  Here are some SPOILERS: Timberlake's character ""wins"" fights by giving people his time ...and then they somehow don't notice that all of their time is gone!  Magic!  Uh, what?  Time is the most precious thing around and yet these two bungling fools repeatedly rob banks by ...driving a car through the glass facing of the banks!  Magic!  The police can get daily rations of time and it takes literally less than a second for the transfer, but when one is hot on the pursuit of Timberlake's character ...you guessed it!  He decides to cancel his time transfer and wait until later.  You figure out the big spoiler about what happens next!Lastly, the acting is pretty horrible.  The dialogue consists of short one-liners.  Meaning, they were short, not funny.

I think George would have loved this, not just for the clever plot that borrows only his most essential concept, which was very PK Dick to begin with, but for the heart at the core of this tale.The acting is mostly decent, especially Murphy, and the script falters only now and then with its overuse of merely fair wordplay. But it's the overall premise that keeps this going, being so very close in essence to what's going on in today's world.Yes, this is in fact really a critique of our banking system, and greed in general (New Greenwich is clearly a play on Greenwich, where so many of the Wall Street scumbags live in 100-million dollar homes, paid for by money stolen from our 401ks, and of course those wonderful Obushma bailouts). Just like Niccol's classic Gattaca, the social criticism here is nicely wrapped up in a plot that doesn't hammer the moral home every minute, but by the end you see the injustice very clearly.Timberlake is almost great, but he's still a few films away from the subtlety and quiet power he could have brought to this role. Nonetheless, he's pretty good, all told, and keeps the movie moving through its various twists and turns.The blu-ray has a very nice transfer but doesn't really need it, as the sets are pretty downtrodden to begin with. But the arm clocks are a nice device, and the good docs on the film show the ink dots that were there during filming, and you see how very nicely done the clock effect was. The idea really is great, though of course in reality the time banksters would know where every single until came from and went to. Details like that should be thought of ahead of time, but oh well, at least I will neither die at 25 or live forever, both quite unsavory prospects.In Time is well worth watching and thinking about, in light of our impending global economic collapse.",4,"Great ideas, decent execution",1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,1947,"['first', 'thing', 'came', 'mind', 'when', 'started', 'was', 'Logan', 'Run', 'written', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'old', 'friend', 'think', 'George', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'not', 'just', 'clever', 'plot', 'only', 'most', 'essential', 'concept', 'was', 'very', 'PK', 'Dick', 'begin', 'heart', 'core', 'tale.The', 'acting', 'mostly', 'decent', 'especially', 'Murphy', 'script', 'only', 'now', 'then', 'overuse', 'merely', 'fair', 'wordplay', 'overall', 'premise', 'going', 'being', 'so', 'very', 'close', 'essence', 'what', 'going', 'today', 'world.Yes', 'fact', 'really', 'critique', 'banking', 'system', 'greed', 'general', 'New', 'Greenwich', 'clearly', 'play', 'Greenwich', 'where', 'so', 'many', 'Wall', 'Street', 'scumbags', 'live', '100-million', 'dollar', 'homes', 'paid', 'money', 'stolen', '401ks', 'course', 'wonderful', 'Obushma', 'bailouts', 'Just', 'Niccol', 'classic', 'Gattaca', 'social', 'criticism', 'here', 'nicely', 'wrapped', 'up', 'plot', ""n't"", 'hammer', 'moral', 'home', 'minute', 'end', 'see', 'injustice', 'very', 'clearly.Timberlake', 'almost', 'great', 'still', 'few', 'films', 'away', 'subtlety', 'quiet', 'power', 'could', 'have', 'brought', 'role', 'Nonetheless', 'pretty', 'good', 'told', 'movie', 'moving', 'various', 'twists', 'turns.The', 'blu-ray', 'very', 'nice', 'transfer', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'sets', 'are', 'pretty', 'downtrodden', 'begin', 'arm', 'clocks', 'are', 'nice', 'device', 'good', 'docs', 'film', 'show', 'ink', 'dots', 'were', 'filming', 'see', 'how', 'very', 'nicely', 'done', 'clock', 'effect', 'was', 'idea', 'really', 'great', 'course', 'reality', 'time', 'banksters', 'would', 'know', 'where', 'single', 'came', 'went', 'Details', 'should', 'be', 'thought', 'ahead', 'time', 'oh', 'well', 'least', 'will', 'neither', 'die', '25', 'live', 'forever', 'quite', 'unsavory', 'prospects.In', 'Time', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'thinking', 'about', 'light', 'impending', 'global', 'economic', 'collapse']",In Time
1416257,A136MAOWGCU2C2,B004LWZW7E,K.T. May,"[8, 20]","**Warning: This review contains spoilers.**""In Time"" is an action film for pretty boys.  Justin Timberlake stars as Will Salas, one of many who live in a futuristic world where physical aging stops at the age of 25.  However, this is also the point where the LED clock on your arm starts to tick down to zero, at which point the rest of your life is spent chasing after minutes to keep yourself alive to, essentially, chase after more minutes, which can be gained through metal devices designed for the purpose or in small amounts from those generous enough to share.  Time is either treated as currency or a drug, the next fix always being slightly out of reach.There are many moments in this film in which I became consciously aware that I wasn't buying what they were trying to sell me.  Straight out of the gate, we are supposed to believe that Olivia Wilde is Timberlake's mom.  I was squirming in my seat during their first scene together, imagining that some sordid episode between the two would eventually result.Cut to Salas hanging out in a bar that introduces us to both of the television stars of the film. Johnny Galecki of ""Big Bang Theory"" is Salas' best friend, a drunken loser whose wife is raising the kids while he indulges in his nightly binges.  Serendipitously, Timberlake and Galecki are in the bar the same night as Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer of ""White Collar"") who ""has a lot of time on his hands"".  That is to say, he's rich.  The ""minutemen"" (thugs) have tracked him down to this very bar to fight him for his wealth.  (To clarify, ""fighting"" consists of limp-wristed arm-wrestling where those involved press their clocks together to make time run down.  The victor walks away, still in possession of his own time, with the added bonus of the other party's time.  To ""time out"" is to die.)What happens next, and for the remainder of the film, are a series of thoroughly formulaic events.  Salas saves Hamilton's life.  He takes him back to a warehouse where they have a long discussion, Bomer's lines believably delivered, Timberlake's not so much.  They sleep and in the morning, Hamilton gifts Salas with all of his time, save for enough to get him to the nearest bridge so that he can plummet from it when his clock times out.  Since this is not a suicide per se, the only explanation for his chosen location that I could come up with is to get the police involved.  Enter ""timekeeper"" Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy) who, of course, is going to now investigate where all that ""time"" went, which will undoubtedly lead him into a series of less-than-satisfying encounters with Salas.Yet ""ironically"", no sooner does Salas receive this ""gift of time"", that his mom ""times out"" on the first of many long-distance and stiletto-heeled runs that were apparently prerequisites for women who wanted to star in this film.  I laughed at how quickly her clock ran down.  No other passage of time is treated with such a quick cut as this one was.  I grimaced as Timberlake proved my anticipation correct - that he would hold his mother's lifeless body in his arms and scream ""Nooooooo!"" at no one in particular.From here, Salas vows to take revenge on the rich folks who live in a different ""time zone"" who have absolutely nothing to do with his mother's death, but are driving up the prices on everyday needs that will eventually kill everyone when they ""time out"" in order to live (more ""irony"").  He meets Phillippe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser), another character with an ill-conceived moniker, and his daughter, Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried), the obvious love interest.  Another awful clich&eacute; is enacted when Salas half-heartedly attempts to teach Sylvia how to live her life on the edge by taking her for a swim in the ocean of her backyard.  (That's not a joke.)Of course, Leon tracks Salas down to this location and, to no one's surprise, Timberlake breaks free.  He grabs Sylvia by the arm and they embark on the well-known pursuit of police cat with criminal mice, with a dash of minute men here and there and a weak car chase thrown in for good measure.  What is the purpose of these minutemen anyway?  Do they exist solely to prove that time isn't the only threat to mankind?  Wait, no - that is thrown in for exposition two thirds of the way through the film.  Of course, Salas meets up with these men and fights them, but the end result is yawn-worthy.  The film ends on a Robin Hood meets Bonnie and Clyde note, and we are surprised when we realize just how many times we zoned out during the past two hours.Murphy was finally afforded more screen time in his role as Leon.  This was a relief, considering how a majority of his past roles, like Dr. Crane/Scarecrow in Batman Begins or even his starring roles, like that of Jackson Rippner in Red Eye, have generally cut him short when he has the chops to hold his own.  Bomer, Seyfried and Kartheiser are believable as well, although Kartheiser seems to give us more of his Pete Campbell from Mad Men.  Timberlake is outshone here when matched up against these veterans, and the veterans seem to be appearing either in type-casted roles or are phoning in their performances.There are enough time-related puns in this film to sink a ship.  And there is one sequence in which a car tumbles down a hill where the CGI's obviousness is laughable.  The concept is interesting enough, but the idea is stretched so thin that it's transparent.  The script, with its trite and lackluster dialogue, appears to be a first attempt by a recent film school graduate.  If you think you are headed out to see an action film, then you will be as misled as I was by the trailer.  This is more of a heist film than an action film, and it's not a very good one.",2,Meh,1320796800,"11 9, 2011",2011,5718,"['**Warning', 'review', 'spoilers', '**', 'Time', 'action', 'film', 'pretty',

1416260,A2VQ3I1TR364UU,B004LWZW7E,LADY HA! HA!,"[1, 1]","A movie with great imagination based on ""Time & Life"".  I'm not one for watching movie's with far fetched idea's which is what I thought I was getting into before I watched this one, but I was wrong, this had just enough to keep my interest and made me wonder what it would be like if this was to happen someday. This was action filled, but with a ""Creative and Imaginative"" twist to it, unlike the usual jumping out of airplanes, hitting the ground and still getting up to continue your lunch date without even as so much as a scratch on you.  The thought of using ""Time"" as currency to live is a interesting concept. To be monitored in life by  ""Timekeeper's"" to determine how much time your clock has left. In this movie one must have ""Time"" embedded in their wrist to exist in life, to continue to live, to buy grocery's, to travel or to get to work, everything cost time.  The concept to live in a world which is programmed to  allow life to go to age 25, then one must borrow, steal, or gamble to get  more  time from somewhere or their  time clock will expire and they will die. Justin Timberland plays the role of a young man who lives in a poverty stricken area where TIME is of very little and  trying to survive another day is full time job. His mothers life is in jeopardy simply because she has two hours left on her wrist, her bus fare to get home from work has been changed from 1 hour to 2 hours, she frantically  runs through the streets hoping to find her son (who is played my Timberland) who has time on his wrist and can lend her some. What will come of that...hmmmm, take the time to watch it.  As the movie continues Wil(Timberland) sets out to attempt to change the World of Time the best he can . As he is out and about at a local bar having a few suds with some friends, he meets a man who has at least 100 years embedded on his wrist.  Fearing for this strangers life, Wil attempts to tell the man with that much time he will be killed by others if he allows people to see his wrist where the amount of  time is showed. Just as  Wil is explaining  this to the wealthy man,"" Thugs of ""Time Stealing"" come and attempt to steal him of his 100 years. Wil now helps him escape and brings him to safety.  The wealthy man not wanting to have to live his life in constant fear and battle over the value of time, gives Wil all his times as Wil is sleeping  and allows himself only 3 minutes to live.  Wil now having over a 100 years shares his time with those not so fortunate.  Wil goes to the Casinos to gamble  his t6ime in hope to even get more time. His goal to share it with others.

Still I enjoyed the overall plot and never got bored. The morality play about the idle rich who live a long time but are not alive versus the poor who appreciate anything they can get really strikes a chord in this country today. I liked the solution to the time squeeze and how the father was exposed as cold blooded. I look back on the movie wishing that I could have felt more emotionally connected to the two main characters.

1416271,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B004LWZW7E,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","I found this film quite watchable and slightly above the usual (not very high) level of Sci-Fi works usually served by Hollywood. Below, more of my impressions with some limited SPOILERS.In XXII century people are born genetically engineered, in such a way that when they turn 25, they stop aging. However, at the same time their integrated bionical clock (installed at birth with the display interface appearing on the forearm) begins counting down. The clock bears 1 year of time - when it reaches zero, the person ""times out"" and is killed instantly. Time on bionical clocks is the universal and ONLY legal currency - people can earn more time, mostly by working for a wage (donation transfers are also possible) but also have to spend it by purchasing goods and services. The country is rigidly divided into ""time zones"", based on the wealth of their populations. Inevitably, in this world too there are criminals, including the bandits robbing people of their time (and therefore also life) - those despised but greatly feared gangsters are called ""Minute Men"". There is also of course the police, an elite force of Timekeepers...The main hero of the story is Will Salas (Justin Timberlake), a simple factory worker, exercing a low paid blue-collar job. Together with his widowed mother Rachel (Olivia Wilde) he lives in the poorest ""time zone"". Both of them are hard-working, honest, likeable people and they rather enjoy their simple life - until one fateful day when Will meets a really weird drunk guy in a bar... And then the story really begins and I will say no more, except that at one moment his path will cross those of a morbidly rich guy, a certain Philip Weis (Vincent Kartheiser), his jaded and very bored daughter Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried), an extremely dangerous Minuteman known only as ""Fortis"" (Alex Pettyfer) and a very competent but completely fanatical in a Javert-like way Timekeeper, detective Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy).As recent Sci-Fi films go, this one, without being a real masterpiece, is better than most and I actually liked it. The whole idea, not really easy to keep under control, is not half-bad treated. Scenario and dialogs are not bad at all. Action scenes are not really the point in this film, but the few included are quite honest. Characters are rather well developped and there is less stereotypes here than usually - even the morbidly rich guy and the main gangster have their story to tell, instead of just being evil and die a horrible screaming death.The greatest and best surprise in this film is Justin Timberlake - I really didn't expect it but I actually LIKED his performance! The rest of cast is good too, with Amanda Seyfried proving here again that she is much more than just a pretty face. Even Alex Pettyfer redeems himself after this ""I am number four abomination""...One thing I didn't exactly like is the idea that you can fix the wrongs of an unfair society by robbing the banks at gunpoint... It may seem an obvious choice, but as most easy fixes of complex problems (and especially VIOLENT easy fixes) it has ""highway to hell"" written all over it - and yet the makers of this film seem to propose just such a way to deal with the problem.Now, there is another thing (this is not a criticism of the film here) which I found VERY interesting and rather funny, is that the makers of this film wanted almost certainly to criticise capitalism and its injustices - and ended by producing an ardent criticism of socialism and a great vibrant tribute to the Western model of society, based on democracy and free market economy instead...))) And here is how they did it:- the political model of the world described in this film is clearly totalitarian in its political aspect as there is no political parties, no organised opposition, no free media, no labour unions, there seems to not even be a real justice system (!), etc. - there are only some NGO charities tolerated... Therefore the state stands alone above everything, towers over the unorgainsed individuals and therefore can bully and crush them at will. Well, such is not the case in modern capitalist countries - in fact it is exactly the opposite, everywhere where advanced, developped capitalism exists there are also organised parties, labour unions, free press and above everything else the counter-power of courts fo justice...- even more important is the socio-economic aspect of this not so brave new world - it is clearly socialist! You want proof? Well, let me count the ways: the state FIXES prices of everything by administrative decision (so there is no free market and therefore no-capitalism); everybody MUST adhere to the state owned and state controlled unique health care program and there is NO ESCAPE possible (like with Obamacare); state has the monopoly of the control and distribution of the most crucial resource - the technology of anti-ageing and its dark passenger, the ""out of time"" death swith""; all kind of competition which could offer similar technology without the integration of a death switch was clearly eliminated by the state, etc., etc.- in fact, the totalitarian control of the state over the economy in this reality seems to be so strong, that there is not even a hint at the existence of black market, on which goods and services could be traded against other kind of money than time - me for one I can very easily imagine, that people would be ready to save their precious days, hours and even seconds by buying illegally stuff using ANY other variety of money, like things stolen from the factories (stealing from workplace was how millions of people survived the misery of communism), labour or even sex (it is after all a place in which women are never older than 25 - and a 25 year old woman, if she REALLY wanted it, would always find a way to stop buying food with hours of her life...)Therefore the obvious way of getting out of this totalitarian, socialist nightmare was not to rob banks, but to dismantle the state monopolies, adopt a good anti-trust legislation, let the market fix the prices instead of the corrupt oligarchy and especially let people organise in political parties and labour unions and then have free elections - which is the way things are done today in developped capitalist countries, for the greatest benefit of all. Elections and free market are almost always the solution - robbing banks virtually never is.OK, this is only a film, so I will finish my lecture (rant?) here and go to the conclusion. This is actually a decent, rather good Sci-Fi film, with good actors and not so stupid scenario - it's just that the conclusion in form of message ""Bonnie and Clyde were right"" in my opinion hurt it a little. But still, a film well worth watching.

1416272,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B004LWZW7E,MadMacs,"[2, 3]","Not bad at all.Have to admit at having deep reservations regarding Timberlake. His previous films were middling to barrel bottom. Few performers can transition readily between completely different mediums. Rarely will you see a writer make a great painter; a wrestler make a great singer. And based on what I heard from other scifi film fans when this first went into production, and my own experience, misgivings were not completely unfounded.So I admit at being happily surprised. He wasn't bad. In fact, I'd rate the film pretty good and his execution solid. Not that he's going to be queuing up to the award shows, but decent enough where I didn't cringe.It's a solid blend of several well-worn themes, drawing most notably from 'Bonnie and Clyde'. But that's not a knock. Nothing wrong with a reboot, if it's done well - improving and not just rehashing.And it's clever enough to cover the thin spots, smart enough to push back heavy examination, and primarily - set on a solid action oriented pace so that you don't focus too hard on the loose underpinnings of the plot.My only serious critique, and I don't mean to take anything away from a very decent performance by the young songster, but I couldn't help but think how much better this could've been with Matt Bomer in the lead role; he played the disillusioned Greenwich swell.Just saying.Overall, a very entertaining and interesting film premise. Completely worth the funds and time spent.Movie Note: This wasn't the first 'Time Equals Life' concept to be produced.

1416277,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004LWZW7E,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","The subject of time and immortality has had a long standing tradition in science fiction. Perhaps the most famous of late was the 1976 film LOGAN'S RUN where people died voluntarily on their thirtieth birthday. So it only seems natural that the subject of time would once again come to the forefront in sci-fi as it does with IN TIME.In the future humans have been genetically altered to stop aging at on their 25th birthday. The problem is when they hit that age they only have so many hours left to live. Embedded in each person is a digital readout on their arm that shows how long they have. To gain more hours you must work to earn them. This means those on the low end of the scale must work to pay for their daily needs like food and shelter. It also means that when their clock reads 0 they die.Existing in this world is Will Salas (Justin Timberlake), a factory worker trying to make ends meet while living with his mother (Olivia Wilde). She has just turned 50 and it may take viewers a second to realize that when he kisses this woman it's his mom not a girlfriend. Remember, you stop aging at 25.Due to celebrate her birthday after work, Will stops by a bar with his friend to find a stranger passing out free drinks with nearly a century of time on his arm. When the local hood and his gang attempt to rob him of his time, Will helps him escape. The man is Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer) and he and Will talk about time. He explains that for there to be time for the upper crust to live they have to take it from someone else. Tax hikes and higher prices are just ways for the rich and famous to live longer at the costs of those below them. While hiding out overnight, Henry passes along his hours to Will telling him to use them wisely.Will tries to reach his mother but things don't work out as planned. She's just paid off her latest loan with less than an hour left and it costs 2 hours to ride the bus. On the street near home she and Will head towards each other but just as they are about to meet, she collapses, her time out. Now Will decides to take the time problem to its source, the wealthy.Staying at fine hotels and buying a fast car, the world of the rich is different. No one hurries as they have all the time in the world. But Will can't help himself. It's this fast paced lifestyle that singles him out as the Timekeepers, police who handle time crimes, come looking for him led by Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy). Will ends up at a casino where he wagers all his time against a wealthy businessman named Philipe Weiss (Vincent Kartheiser), a wager that Will wins resulting in an invitation to Weiss home.At the party Will meets Philipe's daughter Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried) and the two are attracted to one another. But Sylvia also finds herself attracted to the differences she finds in Will having no idea where he is actually from. When the Timekeepers show to arrest Will, he takes Sylvia hostage and heads home.What follows is a transformation of Sylvia as she sees how others live doing anything for just a few more hours. With the Timekeepers hot on their trail, they begin robbing banks to redistribute time to those in need, sort of a Robin Hood of the time clock.Eventually we know that a final confrontation will result as Raymond diligently pursues the couple as does the local hood Will confronted at the start of the film. With plenty of high speed chases and some face to face confrontation, the film features plenty of action for fans without a ton of story to get in the way. Sure the story is there but as the film heads to its end it becomes smaller and smaller.The time is money wordplay works well throughout the film and the story does have enough meat on it to be interesting. As always it does ring a little hypocritical for high paid movie stars to be in a movie that's presents an allegory about how wealthy people should share the wealth with everyone instead of taking it all for themselves, especially when ticket prices for a movie run an average of $9.Timberlake shows that he can act better than many would expect. Too many write him off as little more than a singer but he's turning into one of the few all round entertainers show business has to offer. Seyfried looks gorgeous as always and does a great job when it comes to action as well. Murphy demonstrates that he's not a one note actor, offering a performance of a cop on a mission quite well.On the whole the movie is pure fluff entertainment posing as a message movie. The entertainment offered is substantial but the message is lost and would seem better suited for a Michael Moore movie where he sits in his mansion complaining about how the little people are being ripped off. All in all it's still a good time and worth a rental.",3,TIME RUNS OUT,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,4751,"['subject', 'time', 'immortality', 'had', 'long', 'standing', 'tradition', 'science', 'fiction', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'famous', 'late', 'was', '1976', 'film', 'LOGAN', 'RUN', 'where', 'people', 'died', 'voluntarily', 'thirtieth', 'birthday', 'only', 'natural', 'subject', 'time', 'would', 'once', 'again', 'come', 'forefront', 'sci-fi', 'IN', 'TIME.In', 'future', 'humans', 'have', 'been', 'genetically', 'altered', 'stop', 'aging', '25th', 'birthday', 'problem', 'when', 'hit', 'age', 'only', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'hours', 'left', 'live', 'Embedded', 'person', 'digital', 'readout', 'arm', 'how', 'long', 'have', 'gain', 'more', 'hours', 'must', 'work', 'earn', 'low', 'end', 'scale', 'must', 'work', 'pay', 'daily', 'needs', 'food', 'shelter', 'also', 'when', 'clock', '0', 'die.Existing', 'world', 'Will', 'Salas', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'factory', 'worker', 'trying', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'living', 'mother', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'just', 'turned', '50', 'may', 'take', 'viewers', 'second', 'realize', 'when', 'woman', 'mom', 'not', 'girlfriend', 'Remember', 'stop', 'aging', '25.Due', 'celebrate', 'birthday', 'work', 'Will', 'bar', 'friend', 'find', 'stranger', 'passing', 'out', 'free', 'drinks', 'nearly', 'century', 'time', 'arm', 'When', 'local', 'hood', 'gang', 'attempt', 'rob', 'time', 'Will', 'escape', 'man', 'Henry', 'Hamilton', 'Matt', 'Bomer', 'Will', 'talk', 'time', 'be', 'time', 'upper', 'crust', 'live', 'have', 'take', 'someone', 'else', 'Tax', 'hikes', 'higher', 'prices', 'are', 'just', 'ways', 'rich', 'famous', 'live', 'longer', 'costs', 'hiding', 'out', 'overnight', 'Henry', 'hours', 'Will', 'telling', 'use', 'wisely.Will', 'tries', 'reach', 'mother', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'planned', 'just', 'paid', 'off', 'latest', 'loan', 'less', 'hour', 'left', '2', 'hours', 'ride', 'bus', 'street', 'home', 'Will', 'head', 'towards', 'other', 'just', 'are', 'meet', 'time', 'out', 'Now', 'Will', 'take', 'time', 'problem', 'source', 'wealthy.Staying', 'fine', 'hotels', 'buying', 'fast', 'car', 'world', 'rich', 'different', 'one', 'have', 'time', 'world', 'Will', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'fast', 'paced', 'lifestyle', 'out', 'Timekeepers', 'police', 'who', 'handle', 'time', 'crimes', 'come', 'looking', 'led', 'Raymond', 'Leon', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'Will', 'up', 'casino', 'where', 'time', 'wealthy', 'businessman', 'named', 'Philipe', 'Weiss', 'Vincent', 'Kartheiser', 'wager', 'Will', 'resulting', 'invitation', 'Weiss', 'home.At', 'party', 'Will', 'Philipe', 'daughter', 'Sylvia', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'two', 'are', 'attracted', 'one', 'Sylvia', 'also', 'attracted', 'differences', 'Will', 'having', 'idea', 'where', 'actually', 'When', 'Timekeepers', 'show', 'arrest', 'Will', 'Sylvia', 'hostage', 'heads', 'home.What', 'transformation', 'Sylvia', 'how', 'others', 'live', 'doing', 'anything', 'just', 'few', 'more', 'hours', 'Timekeepers', 'hot', 'trail', 'begin', 'robbing', 'banks', 'redistribute', 'time', 'need', 'sort', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'time', 'clock.Eventually', 'know', 'final', 'confrontation', 'will', 'result', 'Raymond', 'diligently', 'couple', 'local', 'hood', 'Will', 'confronted', 'start', 'film', 'plenty', 'high', 'speed', 'chases', 'face', 'face', 'confrontation', 'film', 'plenty', 'action', 'fans', 'ton', 'story', 'get', 'way', 'Sure', 'story', 'there', 'film', 'heads', 'end', 'smaller', 'smaller.The', 'time', 'money', 'wordplay', 'well', 'film', 'story', 'have', 'enough', 'meat', 'be', 'interesting', 'always', 'ring', 'little', 'hypocritical', 'high', 'paid', 'movie', 'stars', 'be', 'movie', 'presents', 'allegory', 'how', 'wealthy', 'people', 'should', 'share', 'wealth', 'everyone', 'instead', 'taking', 'especially', 'when', 'ticket', 'prices', 'movie', 'run', 'average', '9.Timberlake', 'shows', 'can', 'act', 'better', 'many', 'would', 'expect', 'Too', 'many', 'write', 'off', 'as', 'little', 'more', 'singer', 'turning', 'one', 'few', 'round', 'show', 'business', 'offer', 'Seyfried', 'gorgeous', 'always', 'great', 'job', 'when', 'action', 'as', 'well', 'Murphy', 'not', 'one', 'note', 'actor', 'offering', 'performance', 'cop', 'mission', 'quite', 'well.On', 'whole', 'movie', 'pure', 'fluff', 'entertainment', 'posing', 'message', 'movie', 'entertainment', 'offered', 'substantial', 'message', 'lost', 'would', 'seem', 'better', 'suited', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'movie', 'where', 'mansion', 'complaining', 'how', 'little', 'people', 'are', 'being', 'ripped', 'off', 'still', 'good', 'time', 'worth', 'rental']",In Time

Mostly because I didn't want him to have any opinion before we started. He had no idea who the star was and really enjoyed the movie. At the end he said, ""that was actually really good.""It is an interesting concept that actually reminded me a little of Logan's Run. I know many won't know what I am talking about after all it was from 1976, but I really love that movie growing up.In Logan's Run once you reach 30 you die. This is accepted as your fate and everyone goes except for the runners who don't want to die. For In Time, once you reach 25 you stop aging and suddenly get a digital counter on your arm that basically counts down your life in a way to keep the population controlled.The only people who live long are the rich. Instead of currency you are paid in time and pay out in time. Your counter is replenished with time when you work, or if someone transfers time to you, otherwise it counts down.Justin as Will receives time (a lot of time) from someone he helps. When he is falsely accused of murder, he must figure out a way to bring down the system where the wealthy live forever and the poor scramble for every moment. Stealing time from those who fall asleep. It's easy, you simply put your counter against theirs and go!I had high hopes for this movie and I must admit, I LOVED it. It is a great Sci-fi fix. While I think it could have been better and I am not sure that Justin is a great actor. I truly did enjoy it.  Will has time, Will has no time, Will takes time, Will gives time. Sounds boring but honestly it is pretty creative. Different! The only negative thing my husband said was, ""Justin needs to use his big boy voice.""Personally it was thought provoking.

Writer/director Andrew Niccol has fashioned an intriguing tale of a futuristic world where time is literally money.  Of course the richer you are, the more time you have.  In this world, everyone looks 25 no matter how old you really are, so don't look for any cameos from Harrison or Clint.My main problem with IN TIME is the miscasting of Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried.  While Justin is to be commended for his acting diversity e.g. THE SOCIAL NETWORK, BAD TEACHER etc., I found it hard to accept him as an action hero.  Seyfried has a commanding screen presence more effective in lighter fare e.g. MAMMA MIA, LETTERS FROM JULIET, etc.  She looks great with the 80s brunette pageboy but comes off a little vapid.  The supporting cast fares much better.  Cillian Murphy brings a strong dedication to his role as the Timekeeper.  Vincent Kartheiser is appropriately cold and prudish as millionaire father of Seyfried.  WHITE COLLAR's Matt Bomer evinces pathos as Justin's generous but doomed donator.

Depending on your willingness to listen to the polemic that one's wealth is directly tied to one's longevity will determine how much you enjoy the film.That one point - money is life - is key to In Time's premise, and it's the cost of entry to watch what amounts to Bonnie and Clyde meets Logan's Run. In this non-future, everyone ages to 25 and then begins paying their dues in seconds off their remaining life, a form of population birth control.  The good news is that they will be young and beautiful for the rest of your days; the bad news is that only the rich can afford to be immortal.And that's at the crux of In Time.  Is it better to live a short, exciting life or an eternally long safe one? On the brutal and short side is Will Salas (Justin Timberlake), his hottie mother Rachel (Olivia Wilde), and his best friend Borel (Johnny Galecki). In Time playfully teases us by openly embracing a common movie foible: mothers, sisters, daughters, and wives all look young and beautiful.  The intimate moments between mother and son are uncomfortable for the audience because we can't help but ogle Will's 50-year-old mom.The flip side features the very rich and suicidal Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer), over a century old and bored to death. When Salas saves Hamilton's life from Minutemen mobster Fortis (Alex Pettyfer), he bestows a century on him with a flick of a wrist.  In this universe, everyone's time counts down on their forearm and it can be given or taken by whoever ""has the upper hand"" - two forearms touching exchanges time to the arm on top.See what I just did there? It's impossible to avoid the use of clich&eacute;s in reviewing this film because the script's dialogue gleefully embraces the absurdity of it all. From ""cleaning clocks"" (killing people) to ""keeping time"" (policing citizens), no ironic turn of phrase goes unspoken.  Speaking of keeping time, the only law of consequence are the Timekeepers, led by veteran Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy), who is convinced that Salas stole his time.  When Salas' mother runs out of time, he transforms into a daredevil with nothing to lose, hellbent on getting revenge against the system.The system is embodied by one of the richest men in the sector, 90-year old time-lender Phillipe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser) and his wide-eyed 27-year-old daughter Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried).  It's not long before Salas climbs his way up the social ladder through ample measures of wits, charm, and violence.In Time has an art aesthetic similar to Equilibrium, embracing a militaristic style of dark colors, smooth lines, and hot women sheathed in stockings and heels.  No one wears sensible shoes in this movie. There are no cell phones and the vehicles look like muscle cars from the 60s.In Time is only as effective as its polemic. Lurking beneath the movie's long shots of pretty people are hot button topics: class warfare, overpopulation, credit scores determining your future, conspiracy theories about an unjust government, the plight of the working man and his aspirations, bank bailouts, and more.  In Time is a little rough around the edges, the dialogue is occasionally trite, and the plot can be uneven, but its message is very - ahem - timely.",4,Timely,1321056000,"11 12, 2011",2011,3313,"['Time', 'retro-sci-fi', 'period', 'piece', 'dystopian', 'setting', 'make', 'political', 'point', 'Depending', 'willingness', 'listen', 'polemic', 'one', 'wealth', 'directly', 'tied', 'one', 'longevity', 'will', 'determine', 'how', 'much', 'enjoy', 'film.That', 'one', 'point', 'money', 'life', 'key', 'Time', 'premise', 'cost', 'entry', 'watch', 'what', 'amounts', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'Logan', 'Run', 'non-future', 'everyone', 'ages', '25', 'then', 'paying', 'dues', 'seconds', 'remaining', 'life', 'form', 'population', 'birth', 'control', 'good', 'news', 'will', 'be', 'young', 'beautiful', 'rest', 'days', 'bad', 'news', 'only', 'rich', 'can', 'afford', 'be', 'immortal.And', 'crux', 'Time', 'better', 'live', 'short', 'exciting', 'life', 'eternally', 'long', 'safe', 'one', 'brutal', 'short', 'side', 'Will', 'Salas', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'hottie', 'mother', 'Rachel', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'best', 'friend', 'Borel', 'Johnny', 'Galecki', 'Time', 'playfully', 'openly', 'embracing', 'common', 'movie', 'foible', 'mothers', 'sisters', 'daughters', 'look', 'young', 'beautiful', 'intimate', 'moments', 'mother', 'son', 'are', 'uncomfortable', 'audience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'ogle', 'Will', '50-year-old', 'mom.The', 'flip', 'side', 'very', 'rich', 'suicidal', 'Henry', 'Hamilton', 'Matt', 'Bomer', 'century', 'old', 'bored', 'death', 'When', 'Salas', 'Hamilton', 'life', 'Minutemen', 'mobster', 'Fortis', 'Alex', 'Pettyfer', 'century', 'flick', 'wrist', 'universe', 'everyone', 'time', 'down', 'forearm', 'can', 'be', 'given', 'taken', 'whoever', 'upper', 'hand', 'two', 'forearms', 'touching', 'exchanges', 'time', 'arm', 'top.See', 'what', 'just', 'did', 'there', 'impossible', 'avoid', 'use', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'reviewing', 'film', 'script', 'dialogue', 'gleefully', 'absurdity', 'cleaning', 'clocks', 'killing', 'people', 'keeping', 'time', 'policing', 'citizens', 'ironic', 'turn', 'phrase', 'unspoken', 'Speaking', 'keeping', 'time', 'only', 'law', 'consequence', 'are', 'Timekeepers', 'led', 'veteran', 'Raymond', 'Leon', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'who', 'convinced', 'Salas', 'stole', 'time', 'When', 'Salas', 'mother', 'time', 'daredevil', 'nothing', 'lose', 'hellbent', 'getting', 'revenge', 'system.The', 'system', 'embodied', 'one', 'richest', 'men', 'sector', '90-year', 'old', 'time-lender', 'Phillipe', 'Weis', 'Vincent', 'Kartheiser', 'wide-eyed', '27-year-old', 'daughter', 'Sylvia', 'Weis', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'not', 'long', 'before', 'Salas', 'climbs', 'way', 'social', 'ladder', 'ample', 'measures', 'wits', 'charm', 'violence.In', 'Time', 'art', 'aesthetic', 'similar', 'Equilibrium', 'embracing', 'militaristic', 'style', 'dark', 'colors', 'smooth', 'lines', 'hot', 'women', 'sheathed', 'stockings', 'heels', 'one', 'sensible', 'shoes', 'movie', 'are', 'cell', 'phones', 'vehicles', 'look', 'muscle', 'cars', '60s.In', 'Time', 'only', 'as', 'effective', 'polemic', 'Lurking', 'movie', 'long', 'shots', 'pretty', 'people', 'are', 'hot', 'button', 'topics', 'class', 'warfare', 'overpopulation', 'credit', 'scores', 'determining', 'future', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'unjust', 'government', 'plight', 'working', 'man', 'aspirations', 'bank', 'bailouts', 'more', 'Time', 'little', 'rough', 'edges', 'dialogue', 'occasionally', 'trite', 'plot', 'can', 'be', 'uneven', 'message', 'very', 'ahem', 'timely']",In Time

It's the year 2169 and humans are now genetically engineered to stop aging at the age of 25 when a glowing clock -in their arm- begin counting downs to zero. No minutes means you die. Humans can add more time to their clocks by working, stealing and hustling, but your lunch might cost as much as 30 minutes, and a bus ride 2 hours. Since unlimited time would lead to overpopulation, the corporatist fascist behind the system use ""timing out"" as a way to control population.Enter Will Salas, an honest hard working 28 street kid (looks 25) who lives with his smoking hot mother (who also looks 25 -talk about awkward). The two live day to day, with less than 24 hours on their arm clocks at any time. Will works at a arm timer factory, where management is shown cheating him out of minutes. One night, at his favorite bar, he saves the life of a suicidal rich guy with more than a century on his arm clock. The rich guy rewards Will by giving a century of life before taking his own. Will than goes to meet his mother, but because she comes up minutes short on her bus fare,  she runs out of time before he can reach her, and times out (dies) in front of him. Will uses his new wealth to go to New Greenwich (where the rich people live)and hustle thousands of years as a poker player. Things turn bad and Will is becomes the murder suspect in the death of the rich guy who gave him the century. His escape involves the kidnapping of Sylvia, the daughter of a minute banking billionaire. The two fall in love and go on a Bonnie and Clyde crime spree.I have to say the premise of this movie is brilliant, as was the first 20 minutes. But after that it falls apart. It's almost like they wanted to write a serious critique of our economic system, but knew it wouldn't fill theater seats, so they turned it into a Bourn Ultimatum style action story after 20 minutes.So the next 20 minutes consisted of martial arts fight scenes and car chases.  But they didn't seem to know how to keep that action going, so they turned it into a Bonnie-and-Clyde crime spree movie, which seemed like plain old lazy writing to me.  Plus, where does a guy working in a timer factory learn to fight like Batman and play poker like Johnny Moss? Even worse than the structure was the dialogue. I guess the writers wanted us to know that despite the karate punches and car chases, they were making a serious movie about inequality. So they tossed in the lines that sounded like what a 6th grader might say after being brainwashed by Howard Zinn.

Literally, a person's life span is determined by how much wealth he or she accumulates.  I love the premise.  In order to buy groceries, your life span is shortened by minutes.  Pay your rent?  A couple months.  You replenish your wealth/life span by your work or charity.  The good news is that the clock kicks in when you're 25 and that's how you look until your time expires.  In this film, at 25 everyone is gorgeous too.  I guess the gene pool is changed as well.  Justin Timberlake takes on his first lead role as Will Salas, one of the laborer class who lives day to day with his mom played by Olivia Wilde.  When Will helps an ultra wealthy (centuries in the bank) man from a criminal gang, intent on robbing his time (easily done with a cute arm-to-arm transfer process), the man gives Will all his time, essentially committing suicide.  Will is caught on a camera nearby so becomes the prime suspect in what police believe to be murder.The story gets interesting when Will escapes to the wealthy part of the city.  He meets a different class and falls for the daughter (a dull Amanda Seyfried) of the central banker (creepy Vincent Kartheiser from ""Mad Men"").  While the trip from the ghetto to the wealthy part of the city took a while the first time, the characters continue to move back and forth with unusual speed.  This didn't make much sense.  The filmmakers were obviously implanting a story line of class warfare, and it's laid down with a heavy hand.

1416294,AGOEKVIJV9UX6,B004LWZW7E,Mr. Markster,"[127, 163]","I'm a sucker for a good sci- fi / action movie. I'm rather forgiving in just how much I will overlook in the name of quality entertainment.First, the Good: Some of the acting (Cillian Murphy, Justin Timberlake and a few others) are respectably solid. Also, the overall concept is very intriguing... the world currency is time, and when a person turns 25 their ""life clock"" actually begins. From the time you are 25, life's objective is to keep your life clock from expiring. If it expires, you die. Not a problem for the rich, who have more time than they know what to do with: a ""wealthy"" person may have centuries to live, while the ""poor"" continuously struggle for more time. It's a very interesting premise that becomes more interesting when a poor worker (Justin Timberlake) saves a ""wealthy"" man from a time stealing mob boss while flaunting his wealth in the ghetto. in return, he gives Justine Timberlake all of his time (over 100 years). In a short but very philosophical discussion the wealthy man, who has mentally lived too long, says ""We are meant to die.""So begins a science fiction tale that promises to serve up plenty of symbolism, philosophical overtones about economy and the meaning of existence. Could it possibly be the rare sci fi / action film panned by critics but destined to become a cult classic somewhere down the road?Hell no.Unfortunately, that's about as good as the film gets.Actually, the movie starts to go down hill and remains spiraling out of control with the entrance of Amanda Seyfried. Sadly, the story abandons all of its earlier adult-oriented promise to become a vapid ""love story"" seemingly aimed at a much younger audience. I was not impressed with Seyfried in ""Red Riding Hood"" and even less impressed with her here. This suprises me, because normally I think she's a good actress. In this movie, she serves well as eye candy, but her acting in this movie was cardboard flat awful. However, in her defense, the characters aren't scripted very well and she really wasn't given much to work with.For example: she plays a wealthy girl who is kidnapped by Justin Timberlake and taken to the ghetto. They are both rendered unconscious and robbed of nearly all their time. Now they have to stay on the move and struggle to stay alive without running out of time. Excellent premise! However, never once does she seem very concerned that she is mere minutes from certain death. She acts incredibly hum-drum for a rich girl who always had an over-abundance of time and now, for the first time in her life (presumably) literally has almost none. The sense of non-urgency really detracted from what could have - and SHOULD have been an incredibly suspenseful segment of the film. Just another example of weak script, weak acting and weak directing all coming together.The third act gets even worse when the two lovers turn into Robin Hood-esque characters, stealing from the wealthy and giving to the poor. The movie becomes so trite that anything once redeeming is no longer a part of the equation. Not that I have a problem with the class warfare message behind the film: I agree with a lot of it. I just felt the execution of that message fell flat.Also, the 'ghetto' was way too tame: in a world where time can be exchanged simply by grabbing someones arm, think how chaotic, dismal and brutal the ghetto would really be with people killing eachother just to survive a few more minutes. The movie becomes its own worst enemy by completely santizing what it's attempting to condemn in the first place. I understand they didn't want to cross over into R- rated territory, but the ghetto should have been much more chaotic and gritty- even at PG-13.All in all, this movie is so incredibly disappointing because it started with so much promise and then took all that promise and wasted it. Some the actors were solid- I've always been impressed with Cillian Murphy and I must admit that Timberlake easily holds his own as well (except for the god-awful scene when his ""mother"" is killed, which was cringe-worthy bad).With a tighter script and direction, more concentration on story and suspense as opposed to a vapid love story between the stereotypically over-indulged rich girl and the poor boy from the opposite side of the tracks- this could have been so much better than it actually was.",2,Such A Good Concept...

So this movie is an interpretation of that phrase. Now the two main actors of the movie shown in the cover art (Justin Timberlake) as Will Salas and (Amanda Seyfield) as Sylvia Weis are decent actors, but that's about as far as it'll go. Just enough to move the movie along but nothing beyond that.Anyhow, I'll just go straight to the point. The movie was interesting, but throughout the movie, there was a lingering sensation of regret. One of the biggest hint of a failing movie that I seem to be getting more and more often which signifies a decaying American movie industry is the ever nagging thought ""this had so much potential"" , ""this movie could have been really great if..."" , ""what a waste of such an interesting subject for a movie..."".To me, if the viewer, in this case myself, feels this way throughout the movie, it just means the movie is lacking. Enough for me to not consider a rewatch ever again. The cleverness of time is money and money is time ends right where the period ends this sentence. The acting wasn't great, the movie felt a bit rushed, the story was weak and felt emotionless. So much potential in drama and action, but cut severely short, crippling the movie.

But after reading 10-20 of them, a pattern begins to form.Rather than delve into the actors and who IS or ISN'T a good actor, I think overshadows what's the underlying and most important factor here:  The concept of whether this type of societal situation could ever happen?  As you may or may not know, the movie was accused of plagiarizing a short story written by Harlan Ellison.  Long story short (no pun intended), a lawsuit was eventually dropped and everyone moved on their merry way.Movies like ""In Time"" and others such as ""I Robot"", ""Children Of Men"" and ""District 9"" all speculate about the future of mankind but they all cling to the same premise: that the future is doomed to even worse a fate than we can imagine even in our so called ""modern times"".At best, these movies are subjective and whether one can enjoy them or not depends on whether or not you buy into their premise.  Personally, I see them all as thought provoking and yet........a form of escapism.  They are a fantasy created by the writer for us to decide either to go along with it or not.Does ""In Time"" have from a technical, artistic and dramatic point of view, faults and flaws?

The time they have left to live is seen as green glowing numbers on their arms. In this world where time is literally money, the poor are always struggling for a few more minutes, while the rich have the potential to live for all of eternity. Will Salas unexpectedly hits the jackpot when a suicidal man gives him the rest of his time- over one hundred years. Will soon sees how the other half lives and makes it a mission to redistribute the wealth. He befriends socialite Sylvia Weis, and the two play Robin Hood, emptying the accounts of the rich and giving more time to those in the ghetto. With the Timekeepers on their trail, Will and Sylvia rely on each other to survive.I thought the premise of this movie was really interesting and was excited to see how it would play out. The first ten minutes or so looked promising but it just went downhill after that. Cillian Murphy was excellent as both a creepy, yet justice-driven Timekeeper. Justin Timberlake was all right in his role. Amanda Seyfried was not great- she always seemed to have the same cool expression on her face. I also thought the movie became inundated with cliches- rich girl/poor boy, Robin Hood, idiomatic expressions- which made most of the movie very predictable. There were also a lot of things that were unclear to me- like wouldn't there be more violence if people could just kill each other for more time? And how did Sylvia know how to shoot a gun so well when she had been protected by bodyguards her whole life?

1416333,A1RI7SD2KGO5HP,B004LWZW7E,Rudy James Jr.,"[0, 0]",This was an interesting movie and I really enjoyed the plot line in the movie. I did not even mind JT being in the movie. I enjoyed what they showed the concept was very well thought out and applied. Live until you are 25 and then you have 1 year of time and you have to earn more and of course everything is paid for with time. I really like that idea.Maybe some spoilers:Now the movie it had a slow start and built a good story around what could not be proved as a murder or a theft there was just no evidence. The time police to me really did not present or maybe they do not have to present any solid reason for doing to JT what they did. He did nothing wrong. All of his action where in reaction to what was being done to him.A problem he was given the 100 odd yrs but he then went on to win a whole lot of more years. So the time police show up and take not only what was given to him but also what he rightfully won. Now I know there would be no movie if this did not happen but I think we could have com up with a better way to get the action moving. That is the major problem that kept this movie from reaching say a Matrix level of WOW. They show how corrupt the time police are right away. Hey we can not prove you killed any one we can not prove you were not given that time freely but we are here and we are just going to take all your time away because we can.Come on you got the workings for a great story but then you make it so simple that is just lays there no twist no pop just flat there it is we take your time and you run to get more.

1416334,ANA2PVMARGY8H,B004LWZW7E,"Sarah ""Bookworm/cat person""","[0, 0]","Although I gave this movie a relatively high rating, I totally acknowledge that it could have been improved upon---i.e., less cliches, script revisions, and tighter direction.  Still, this movie has such an interesting premise, that I wanted to spend some ""time"" sharing my thoughts about it.  I'm a huge Matt Bomer fan (""White Collar""), and to a lesser extent, Cillian Murphy fan.  Cillian Murphy, the Timekeeper, plays a dynamic role.  You get that he can't resolve the inconsistencies of the system that he has spent the last 50 years of his life maintaining, yet like Mr. Stevens, the butler in Remains of the Days, you can tell that he has moments of real doubt whether he has wasted his life in his particular form of servitude. Yet he cannot fully admit to himself that he misspent his life, nitpicking the seconds and minutes of the poor and disenfranchised, while the wealthy can afford to loiter indefinitely. The Timekeeper has the integrity to not be paid off by billionyear, Mr. Weis, yet the Timekeeper still cannot fathom another way around the current status quo.  He is nonplussed when Will gives him enough time to spare his life.It was refreshing that the ghetto wasn't racially or ethnically segregated, just financially segregated.  A blonde-haired man with a posh British accent was the most menacing gangster in this ""wrong-side-of-the-toll"" Time Zone.I suppose in heaven we'll never age beyond late young adulthood, but in the here and now, it would be very strange to see different generations looking exactly the same age; therefore, no visibly aging actor was featured in this movie.  I haven't seen ""Logan's Run,"" but that movie apparently has a similar theme.This movie doesn't really offer solutions, but rather points out how problematic it is for the few privileged to live at the expense of the many underprivileged. This excessive wealth and out-of-proportion longevity doesn't even really make these privileged few happy, as Matt Bomer's character, Henry Hamilton, attests before he times out. If we could all live agelessly, there would be issues of scant resources and overpopulation, yet as I chronically pester my Facebook friends, if we all went whole foods-based vegan, that could help prevent and reverse human starvation, as imported grain (now being forced fed to animals) could be redistributed to humans (i.e., a higher quality version, along with dried beans), and animals can graze on indigestible-to-humans grass, including grass clippings during the winter. (I only recently learned that the meat industry is a huge contributor to human starvation; I went veg b/c I love animals and could no longer pretend it was okay to love my companion pets while hypocritically eating meat from animals who likewise have feelings and are sentient.) This movie subtly (or perhaps not-so-subtly) preaches a dictum I first came across on a bumper sticker: ""Live simply so others can simply live.""",4,Very interesting thematically,1335830400,"05 1, 2012",2012,2931,"['gave', 'movie', 'relatively', 'high', 'rating', 'totally', 'acknowledge', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'improved', '-i.e.', 'less', 'cliches', 'script', 'revisions', 'tighter', 'direction', 'Still', 'movie', 'interesting', 'premise', 'wanted', 'spend', 'time', 'sharing', 'thoughts', ""'m"", 'huge', 'Matt', 'Bomer', 'fan', 'White', 'Collar', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'fan', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'Timekeeper', 'dynamic', 'role', 'get', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resolve', 'inconsistencies', 'system', 'spent', 'last', '50', 'years', 'life', 'maintaining', 'yet', 'Mr.', 'Stevens', 'butler', 'Remains', 'Days', 'can', 'tell', 'moments', 'real', 'doubt', 'wasted', 'life', 'particular', 'form', 'servitude', 'can', 'not', 'fully', 'admit', 'misspent', 'life', 'nitpicking', 'seconds', 'minutes', 'poor', 'disenfranchised', 'wealthy', 'can', 'afford', 'loiter', 'indefinitely', 'Timekeeper', 'integrity', 'not', 'be', 'paid', 'off', 'billionyear', 'Mr.', 'Weis', 'yet', 'Timekeeper', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'fathom', 'way', 'current', 'status', 'quo', 'nonplussed', 'when', 'Will', 'enough', 'time', 'spare', 'life.It', 'was', 'refreshing', 'ghetto', 'was', ""n't"", 'racially', 'ethnically', 'segregated', 'just', 'financially', 'segregated', 'blonde-haired', 'man', 'posh', 'British', 'accent', 'was', 'most', 'menacing', 'gangster', 'wrong-side-of-the-toll', 'Time', 'Zone.I', 'suppose', 'heaven', ""'ll"", 'never', 'age', 'late', 'young', 'adulthood', 'here', 'now', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'strange', 'see', 'different', 'generations', 'looking', 'exactly', 'same', 'age', 'therefore', 'visibly', 'aging', 'actor', 'was', 'featured', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Logan', 'Run', 'movie', 'apparently', 'similar', 'theme.This', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'offer', 'solutions', 'rather', 'points', 'out', 'how', 'problematic', 'few', 'privileged', 'live', 'expense', 'many', 'underprivileged', 'excessive', 'wealth', 'out-of-proportion', 'longevity', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'make', 'privileged', 'few', 'happy', 'Matt', 'Bomer', 'character', 'Henry', 'Hamilton', 'out', 'could', 'live', 'agelessly', 'would', 'be', 'issues', 'scant', 'resources', 'overpopulation', 'yet', 'chronically', 'pester', 'Facebook', 'friends', 'went', 'whole', 'foods-based', 'vegan', 'could', 'help', 'prevent', 'reverse', 'human', 'starvation', 'imported', 'grain', 'now', 'being', 'forced', 'fed', 'animals', 'could', 'be', 'redistributed', 'humans', 'i.e.', 'higher', 'quality', 'version', 'dried', 'beans', 'animals', 'can', 'graze', 'indigestible-to-humans', 'grass', 'including', 'grass', 'clippings', 'winter', 'only', 'recently', 'learned', 'meat', 'industry', 'huge', 'contributor', 'human', 'starvation', 'went', 'b/c', 'love', 'animals', 'could', 'no', 'longer', 'pretend', 'was', 'okay', 'love', 'companion', 'pets', 'hypocritically', 'eating', 'meat', 'animals', 'who', 'likewise', 'have', 'feelings', 'are', 'sentient', 'movie', 'subtly', 'perhaps', 'not-so-subtly', 'dictum', 'first', 'came', 'bumper', 'sticker', 'Live', 'simply', 'others', 'can', 'simply', 'live']",In Time

(greenwich-mean-time) but i'm sure no one else in the theatre even noticed. then the timekeeper leon, (as in ponce-de...) says they'll solve the crime if they ""follow the time"" which is a take-off on the old adage, follow-the-money. again, no laughs in the theater. it's an intelligent movie, and goes right over the heads of most people in the demographic that goes to see sci-fi action.but one evening recently, i watched it on dvd and got much more out of it. i finally noticed that the working-class town is called ""dayton"", and that the movie is full of double-entendres, sly jokes, and allusions. ""maybe he thought it was a drive-through"", ""you shouldn't have"", and ""we look cute together"".... but some scenes, like when salas tries and fails to save his mother, are actually poignant.the style of the film helps keep it interesting. the odd colors, the sets, costumes, and and most of the characters are cartoon-like. but this ""unreal"" quality gives it flavor, cachet. if niccoll wanted it to just seem every-day ""real"" he'd certainly have the women kick off those stiletto heels before they run for their lives. also, if you're old enough to remember, the swimming scene is very like, (possibly an open tribute to) logan's run, the other film where implanted time clocks controll the characters.now, i'm wondering, what more am i still missing?lastly, and very importantly, like all good sci-fi, it has a message. the movie says pretty loud and clear, that extreme, killing poverty, and extreme, insane wealth are wrong.

Heres the interesting part about this movie, the focus is the fact that time=money and there will never be enough. The not so interesting? well the entire human race decided to give up the concept of money in exchange for a genetic clock on everyones arm that is some how updated by either magic hard drive or shaking hands really hard. Why is EVERYONE's clock green? People are still vain, even in the future, surley if they can master clockinyourarm technology they can change the hue of the numbers.The movie has some sex, some running around and shooting, and some kind of heartful lines about how screwed everyone is because the system is a lie. And this is the part where this movie is ruined for me and if you still plan on watching this then don't read this.First off, why are the police so lack luster? If this is such a facist state in which you have to pay ""time"" in order to essentially do ANYTHING except take a piss then where are all the cops which really impressive crowd control gear. They probably spent most of the money on timberlake and trying to ""future"" out the cars which was a complete waste of money because there is such a difference in quality of cars. In one scene theres the brand new dodge challenger parked next to what is that a bronco II??? Anyways, the biggest problem besides the fact that timberlake and thatotherchick manage to somehow rob a bank and its headquarters completley unscathed, is the lack of any real character. Everyone introduced is sort of thrown away in a couple of minutes and most of the actors don't really seem to care because it's not really believable. Not the concept of the movie, but it's enviroment. Everything looks pretty normal still, and no one's really that bothered. What I mean by that is, if you lived in a world where people were dying all around you every second LITERALLY constantly dropping dead in the streets because they were essentially poor then you don't think there would be constant screaming and crying somewhere in the backround? There's no tension in this movie despite the obvious plot thickeners. It's pretty much timberlake just running around doing action stuff and expressing his good guy apathy.Cillian Murphy also plays a character in this movie which is actually the reason why I rented it. Unfortunatley this movie just denies him of any kind of cool scene in anyway shape or form even tho he drives the most exspensive murder mobile in the whole movie(the challenger) but really doesn't even do anything cool with it either so it's actually a complete waste of money (give us scary cops with cool riot gear instead). He wears a trench coat, which automatically makes him the boss, but dies the lamest death I think I've ever seen in a movie. Seriously he just drops dead because he runs out of time, what???? He's called a -> TIMEKEEPER &lt;- You're telling me that this guy who is essentially capable of taking your life via handjob without any sort of probable cause or real reason doesnt constantly carry one of those magic hard drives just in case I dunno, uh, that?

People live to 25 years old, after which time they have one year left, then they die. The good news is that you can buy time and live forever, but only the rich can do that. Everyone else is struggling to stay alive. Currency is done in time, transferred by computer chips installed in the forearm. A cup of coffee will cost you 4 minutes of your life. I kept thinking about ""Logan's Run"" as I watched this film.The cliche possibilities are endless and they are not shy about using them. ""All the time in world."" ""Got a minute."" ""Too much time on my hands"" ""Who's got the time?"" ""You must come from time."" ""Taken years off my life."" ""Drank his life away."" ""Too much time in the wrong hands..."" ""I had the time to buy one of these."" ""Thank you for your time."" ""The time he has taken."" ""It would take a million years."" Ouch!""Hey big spender, spend a little time with me."" ""I'd give a year of my life just to spend an hour with her."" These didn't make the cut.Timberlake plays Will Salas, a man struggling to pay the bills and stay alive along with his mother Rachel (Olivia Wilde). Will saves the life of a rich man who was 108. He wanted to die. From him we get the class warfare speech of the movie. Many must die so a few might live. Taxes and prices are raised to make sure the poor die. Like most science fiction features, they have a social commentary.While Will was asleep, the rich man gives him his time so he can die. Rich people literally live in a different ""time zone"" so they don't get mugged by those who work for the weekend.Timberlake is 5 stars in comedies, but as a dramatic actor, he was unconvincing in this role, which may have been the director's fault. Will is supposed to have passion to distinguish himself from the cautious rich. He lacks, he should have never been in that role (Keanu Reeves spoiled us). Timberlake would have been more convincing as a rich tycoon. Much of the acting was stiff by design, but that made for a bad movie. Other than the time devices, the technology was circa 1985 with no pay phones, 80's automobiles, and no cell phones.No real sex or nudity.

I did. Sure, there are tons of stuff that make no sense. Too many to list, but this again brings me back to the point of 'this is a movie...made in hollywood...& thats how many movies go...'UNREALISTIC'...'..But 'unrealistic does not mean unenjoyable.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Yes, I do agree they could have done alot more with the premise of this movie. After all, the premise is quite interesting...Everybody stops aging at 25 & then has 1 more year. TIME IS THE CURRENCY used to buy things, live & die by.....Awesome premise & if they would have turned this in to a 3 - 5 hour movie/mini-series they really would have had ample time to really expand on the premise...but having to fit everything in at a bit under 1 hr 45 min, they did the best they could & although unbelievable with lots of 'plot holes', this was thoroughly enjoyable.Anyway, no spoliers so let me just say when it comes to movies everybody has different tastes & this movie is no exception. Some will love it, some will hate it but ya know what, you wont know yourself unless you watch it.I almost didnt due to the negative reviews & only ended up seeing it by 'luck', but I sure am glad I did see it & would love to give it 5 stars as I thoroughly enjoyed it but will knock off 1 star due to the 'plot holes' which honestly are impossible to avoid with the premise of this movie & short run time.The visuals were great...actors all did a great job....my rec is to ignore the reviews & watch it..You may hate it but you may also love it.I thought I would hate it & was not even going to waste my time watching it due to the negative reviews....It now resides on my DVR & I've watched it 3 times & still am not bored with it. Its just a 'fun' movie with a very intersting premise assuming you can turn off your brain & just sit back & enjoy it for what it is. It certainly is not 'slow moving'. In fact, the movie flies by pretty fast as there really is no boring parts & its just 'go go go' from beginning to end.I do see why some hated it & others loved it very clearly. & cant blame anybody if they hated or loved it, as both 'camps' have ample reason to back up why they hated or loved it.Put me in the camp who loved it.

It's a sci-fi feature that is far more about concept than it is about special effects.  And it gets into its interesting subject right up front when we see someone pay for their bus ride with the time on their arm and they have almost completely run out of time and can hardly afford it; who wants to spend their remaining minutes taking public transportation let alone paying to do it?  And also, like any good sci-fi, it exposes who we are after some fashion and in this case that spotlight is on the rich/ haves and the poor/ have nots and how the rich don't live because they are protecting their wealth/ time while the poor, who have so little time, can't afford not to live as fully as they can in every moment.  Thoughtful comments and commentary is found in this actioner but, like Hollywood so often does, they leap off from this point and turn the whole thing into a more traditional chase movie that is reminiscent of ""Bonnie & Clyde"" after we get about halfway into it.  Oh, well.  I still liked it and I thought that Justin Timberlake didn't a fine acting job and ""it"" girl Amanda Seyfried with her open and expressive face played both the naf and the defiant quite well while still looking sultry throughout.Don't be afraid to give this movie a chance, unless you value your time too much.

At the age of twenty-five, your clock starts ticking and your goal is to work in order to survive. The wealthy are immortal, while the poor die at a young age. The story is refreshingly unique and the film is done very well. Justin Timberlake stars, and shows that he's come a long way in a short time. When I heard he was starring in this film, I thought it would be another great idea destroyed by a cast of good looking people who can't act, but I was wrong. Timberlake shows he's got definite potential to be a big action star and that his n'suck days are way behind him. Cillian Murphy is also terrific as the timekeeper.

Get more time and stay alive. If not, you get the idea.commerce is measured in time now, too, and life can truly become limitless. Enter the Ghetto and a dream that lives with his mother, living from minute to minute, in debt, wanting to go into another time zone and move up. Everything seems the same until he meets a man in a bar with over a century to burn.Maybe I expected something different, or maybe it was the way the movie played out. i'm not really sure. what I do know is that it was hard to get into this movie, and much of it was because the plot bounced around too much. One moment we are looking at a hero flick, then a moving-on-up flick, then a love flick, then some action in a round-about way. It kept pinballing and that got annoying, only coming together for the benefit of being over. When our main event happened, I thought it was about changing the world. This was reinforced by the thing with the bus (trying to be vague because of spoilers), but then it slowed to a crawl when Justin arrived at his lovely gambling destination. Romance washed away all the years of love and loyalty, and the ocean scene and the timekeeper business just made it more taxing.The acting was off in this film, too, with a lot of the lines and the actions coming off stiff. I have seen all the main actors before and know it could have been better, so that was disappointing. It was almost like they were doing it on purpose, like giving their lines with no ""boom"" was the director's idea. Equally bothersome was the way the people dressed, like a GQ spread and not living, and the way they carried themselves. I knew who a lot of the main characters were because of the actors playing them, but the lower tier characters were a bit confusing because of the age thing and the fact that no time was added ot making them distinct. In a movie when minutes are a premium, a lot of time was spent with scattered ideas like the father, the reoccurring baddies, and so on. When you combine this with a plot that is waning and a movie that becomes rather preachy in its society lesson 101 kinda way, it gets old.i'm not too terrible picky when it comes to my films, but this didn't make me happy. i had expectations but I dont think they were too high above the rim, and this went below.

What keeps the general population from devolving into id-driven mobs is the fact that no one knows how much time they have left on theirs. If you had a constant reminder on your forearm, however, you might simply go about your life in a desperate attempt to prolong it. Or not.Will Salas (played by Justin Timberlake) is a 28-year-old factory worker whose one year clock started and aging stopped, like everyone else in the film, when he turned 25. He and his 50 year-old mother Rachel (played by Olivia Wilde) live in the ghettos of Dayton hoping to earn and save enough to at least see the next day. All while wages in the ghetto are constantly going down and the cost of living is constantly going up. Then, while out drinking with his friend Borel (played by Johnny Galecki), he learns of a man with more than a century left on his clock who has unadvisedly advertised his good fortune while in the same bar as Will and Borel. A local time-thief enters the picture and, rather than retreat like his friend did and advised him to do, Will comes to the aid of the fortunate stranger. While saving his life was all for naught, the stranger gives Will all the time left on his clock before allowing the time on his own clock to run out while he's sitting on a bridge overlooking a dry river basin.""Time is money"" was a phrase first coined by Benjamin Franklin. While the idea of reversing that concept to ""money is time"" is interesting, I don't believe the cast was up to the challenge of exploring it. Whatever success Justin Timberlake might've had in supporting roles, he doesn't have what it takes to be the leading man. Amanda Seyfried, whose role has her playing off Timberlake for a lot of the film, is another professional whose appeal tends to overshadow her abilities for some reason. Perhaps an independent production could provide actors with genuine talent, who are young enough to look the part, but this is closer some sort of CW melodrama.",2,"Great idea, mediocre execution",1326499200,"01 14, 2012",2012,1979,"['Everyone', 'clock', 'What', 'general', 'population', 'devolving', 'id-driven', 'mobs', 'fact', 'one', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'have', 'left', 'theirs', 'had', 'constant', 'reminder', 'forearm', 'however', 'might', 'simply', 'go', 'life', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'prolong', 'not.Will', 'Salas', 'played', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', '28-year-old', 'factory', 'worker', 'one', 'year', 'clock', 'started', 'aging', 'stopped', 'everyone', 'else', 'film', 'when', 'turned', '25', '50', 'year-old', 'mother', 'Rachel', 'played', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'live', 'ghettos', 'Dayton', 'hoping', 'earn', 'save', 'enough', 'least', 'see', 'next', 'day', 'wages', 'ghetto', 'are', 'constantly', 'going', 'down', 'cost', 'living', 'constantly', 'going', 'up', 'Then', 'out', 'drinking', 'friend', 'Borel', 'played', 'Johnny', 'Galecki', 'man', 'more', 'century', 'left', 'clock', 'who', 'unadvisedly', 'advertised', 'good', 'fortune', 'same', 'bar', 'Will', 'Borel', 'local', 'time-thief', 'enters', 'picture', 'rather', 'retreat', 'friend', 'did', 'advised', 'do', 'Will', 'aid', 'fortunate', 'stranger', 'saving', 'life', 'was', 'naught', 'stranger', 'Will', 'time', 'left', 'clock', 'allowing', 'time', 'own', 'clock', 'run', 'out', 'sitting', 'bridge', 'overlooking', 'dry', 'river', 'basin', 'Time', 'money', 'was', 'phrase', 'first', 'coined', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'idea', 'reversing', 'concept', 'money', 'time', 'interesting', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'cast', 'was', 'up', 'challenge', 'exploring', 'success', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'might', ""'ve"", 'had', 'supporting', 'roles', ""n't"", 'have', 'what', 'be', 'leading', 'man', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'role', 'playing', 'off', 'Timberlake', 'lot', 'film', 'professional', 'appeal', 'overshadow', 'abilities', 'reason', 'Perhaps', 'independent', 'production', 'could', 'provide', 'actors', 'genuine', 'talent', 'who', 'are', 'young', 'enough', 'look', 'part', 'closer', 'sort', 'CW', 'melodrama']",In Time
1416364,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B004LWZW7E,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 4]","What if time is really money? ""The Truman Show"" screenwriter Andrew Niccol's latest film takes the idea of ""time as currency"" seriously. Set in an unspecified future world, a sci-fi thriller ""In Time"" gives another meaning to a frequently used phrase ""wasting one's time."" Here the class structures of the haves and the have-nots are determined by the time left to live, shown by the internal ""body clock"" on the wrist.Many people say the idea is interesting. Maybe. But no matter how good the ideas may be, they need to be developed to be turned into a drama with a story. Andrew Niccol, the director of brilliant ""Gattaca,"" seems to have forgotten that. The rest of ""In Time"" is a tepid action flick that does not what it wants to do, that is made up of bits and pieces borrowed from other action movies.All characters are stock types. Justin Timberlake is one of the ""have-nots,"" hard-working Will Salas. Amanda Seyfried is Sylvia Weis, a daughter of a rich family. Cillian Murphy is Raymond Leon, a veteran ""timekeeper."" Throughout the film, what they really want to do is never fully explained. (What does Murphy's ""timekeeper"" have to keep anyway?) The subplot about Johnny Galecki's character, friend of Timberlake's hero, is terribly bland.There are so many holes in the plot, but the biggest problem of the film is its inept storytelling and lack of characters we can identify with.

1416365,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B004LWZW7E,Turfseer,"[0, 0]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0'In Time' was written, directed and produced by Andrew Niccol. Set in 2169, a genetically engineered populace can only live to age 25; beyond that they're given one year which will expire, unless time (which appears as a fluorescent counter on their forearms), is replenished. This gimmick of time for money, is perhaps the only real clever conceit of the film. I enjoyed watching how much a cup of coffee went for (a few minutes) as opposed to the price of a new car (such a purchase would put the purchaser back a good number of months).Todd McCarthy writes in the Hollywood Reporter that the film suffers at the outset from a lack of a back story: ""As cleverly conceived as it is, the time-for-money substitution leaves a lot of questions unanswered. Other than for Leon and a few flunkies, there are no authority figures visible or alluded to. Who runs the country, the city? Is the rest of the world like this? How did the aging process get halted? Given so remarkable an achievement, why are there no other comparable technological advances? Why are all the cars customized early 1960s Lincoln Continentals, Jags and Cadillacs?""Justin Timberlake plays the protagonist, Will Salas, who lives in the economically depressed time zone, Dayton, where the population scrounges day to day, attempting to add precious minutes to their time clock, just to stay alive. The film's break into act two occurs when Salas meets up with a man, Hamilton, who's willing to give him a century of time for nothing in exchange. It's a scene which reminds me of the Twilight Zone episode, 'Long live Walter Jameson', where a man sips a magic motion two thousand years ago and discovers that he never ages. Unlike Twilight Zone, where the man is afraid to die, in this case, Hamilton is tired of living.This leads to the melodramatic scene where Salas' mother (played by Olivia Wilder who is younger than Timberlake in real life) doesn't have enough time to get on a bus as the normal fare has been raised due to inflation. She's reduced to attempting to run home before the clock runs out but doesn't make it, falling into Will's arms, just as her counter lands on zero. It feels odd that she didn't prepare for this contingency but the whole idea is to emphasize the great divide between the haves and the haves-not. Salas blames the affluent who hoard time in the richest time zone, ""New Greenwich,"" for his mother's death. The zone is run by a time hoarding mogul, Phillipe Weis, who is basically your stereotypical 'robber baron', a stock villain.Salas' plan is to somehow institute his own brand of class warfare by getting his hands on Weis' 'eons' and redistribute it to the people. When he arrives in New Greenwich, Weis introduces him to his extended family. Nick Schager of Slant Magazine notes the problem in having everyone the same age in the film: "" A bit more background on the origins of this genetics-predicated social structure would have better fleshed out his narrative, especially with regard to the confounding reality that--since everyone is physically stuck at 25 years old, as epitomized by a hilariously creepy lineup of Philippe's mother-in-law, wife, and daughter--people's romantic and sexual attractions to others must be hopelessly confused by the disconnect between their appearances and age.""In the second half, 'In Time' devolves into your basic crime caper flick replete with foot chases and car crashes. With Will now hooked up with Phillipe's daughter, Sylvia, the two play a futuristic Bonnie & Clyde attempting to elude both the police in the guise of Timekeeper Leon as well as the nasty 'Minuteman' gang member, Fortis. There's a very awkward and unconvincing scene toward the end where Will and Sylvia take Sylvia's father hostage and in the end, make good on their goal of grabbing his 1,000,000 years and redistributing all that time to the common people.The worst part of 'In Time is the clumsy climax. Dana Stevens of Slate Magazine, sums it up best: ""And though there's a vaguely socialist theme of wealth redistribution running through the film, it's never clear what the final goal is for the two time bandits in love: Are they looking to abolish the time-is-money system altogether, or just eke out a few more years for the downtrodden?""Perhaps the most critical and perhaps enjoyable critique is from Kyle Smith in The NY Post. Part of his criticism involves the narrative's lack of verisimilitude: ""Chunks of time (which look like Atari video- game cartridges from 1978 that have been dipped in aluminum) sit barely guarded in vaults that can be breached simply by driving a truck into them,"" as well as a lack of an explanation as to how Leon the Timekeeper is able to confiscate all of Will's time, when he has no evidence that he was guilty of stealing from the 105 year old man. Smith's main criticism comes back to the theme of class warfare: ""The allegory nullifies itself in inviting comparison to reality. Life is more egalitarian than it is in this movie, because while rich people may have more toys, their wealth doesn't buy them the most precious resource. Warren Buffett won't outlive his secretary by centuries.""In the end this is a film that has a clever premise which will keep you watching pretty much to the end. Nonetheless, the plot is awkwardly constructed, leading to a climax which is hardly what I would call thrilling. The lack of thrills perhaps can be attributed to a lack of high stakes as Salas is merely redistributing the wealth and not saving the population from imminent annihilation.",2,"Clever premise can't save predictable dystopia as Phillip K.

Cillian Murphy did a good job (as always) as the bad guy. I bought this on a whim, trying to find some stuff Cyberpunk-ish. This was listed as something similar to it.

1416370,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B004LWZW7E,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[8, 18]","Andrew Niccol's In Time is one of those films that ""could have, should have"" been good but for some reason wasn't. It had an intriguing concept at its core - a future society in which time is literally money and going broke brings new meaning to the term 'sudden death'. And it had a very talented screenwriter and director at the helm, Andrew Niccol, who has done great work with similar ideas before, as the screenwriter behind Gattaca, The Truman Show, S1m0ne and The Terminal, and as director in the case of Gattaca and S1m0ne. But what made these earlier films work - the art of creating a different reality and making it believable through the characters and the attention to detail in the world-building - is unfortunately sadly missing here.The premise - the one that had such promise - is a future in which people have been genetically engineered to stop aging at 25.  The day you turn 25, your internal clock - bioengineered to display in the form of a glowing digital string of numbers along your inner forearm - begins ticking, starting with one year of time remaining. And that number is more than just how much time you have left, because time is now the currency everyone uses.  Everything costs - food, rent, bus fare, even a cup of coffee - and you pay for it with your time. And it's up to you to earn more time, because if your clock ever zeroes out, you're dead - suddenly, quickly and finally. So you're always working against the clock for more time, and you do anything to get it. If your job doesn't give you enough, then you beg, borrow or steal to get more. Anything to keep from running out. Rich people don't have to worry; barring death by accident, they have the potential to live forever. But anyone else...Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) is a working-class guy who, like most people, lives day to day - literally. Through an unexpected turn of events, he is suddenly given a century of time - an unimagineable amount for someone at his level and something that attracts the unwanted attention of one of the system's enforcers, a Timekeeper named Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy in a riveting performance).  Things become further complicated when Will hooks up with Sylvia Weiss (Amanda Seyfried), the spoiled daughter of one of the system's richest men, Phillipe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser). Both Will and Sylvia end up on the run from Raymond and from a local gang who wants all of the time this pair is running around with.As I said, an intriguing premise and a potentially interesting plot. But sadly, the film fails to rise to the occasion. The problems are myriad, but believability is at the top of the list. Except for a handful of devices - like the glowing digital read-outs on everyone's arms and the way time has replaced money with meters that add to or deduct from your time, this world is - particularly visually - indistinguishable from our own. You get the impression that it should be in the future, especially since the film indicates that the system has been in place for at least a century, but nothing about the look of the film reflects that. Not the clothes or the cars or the buildings or anything else. Nothing in the details backs up what you're supposed to believe. Even more problematic are the people; we're _told_ how everything is different but we're almost never _shown_ that things are different.  Not in the way that matters.  The stilted dialogue and staged scenes have all the emotional impact of an infomercial.  Nothing about the way these characters act makes you really believe that most of them are living in a reality where each day is a desperate chance to earn another day.A large part of the fault for this lies in the weak script. In addition to being riddled with banal dialogue, plotholes and dangling plot threads that get introduced and then completely abandoned, the script utterly fails to make the characters' actions believable. This stands in sharp contrast to the kind of scriptwork that Niccol did in both The Truman Show and Gattaca where the story flowed seamlessly and the characters were developed in such a way that all of their actions made sense. In Time, however, requires frequent suspensions of disbelief as the actions of most of the characters frequently make no sense at all. They do what they do because the plot requires it, not because it's what we feel their characters instinctively would do.  Again, given his past excellent work in script-writing, Niccol's failure here is simply inexplicable.Oh, and on a side note, there's apparently a problem with the origins of the core story idea. Apparently many of the details seem to be drawn from Harlan Ellison's award-winning 1965 story ""'Repent, Harlequin', said the Ticktockman"", for which he was not given credit and over which he has sued the production company.Another big problem is in the casting, both in terms of the look of the film and in the quality of the performances.  With regard to the first point, given the underlying premise - that everyone is supposed to stop aging at 25 - it's rather critical to the film's believability that the people in it actually _look_ like they stopped aging at 25. But this is rather hard to pull off when most of the actors, particularly in the key roles, are visibly older than that. In point of fact, only two actors in major roles who are the ages needed are Amanda Seyfried (Sylvia), who's 25, and Alex Pettyfer (Fortis, the gang's leader) who's 21. The rest are all noticably older. Justin Timberlake (Will) is 30. Cillian Murphy (the Timekeeper) is 35. Matt Bomer (the stranger who gives Will the gift of a century) is 34. Johnny Galecki (Borel, Will's best friend) is 36. And Vincent Kartheiser (Sylvia's mega-rich father) is 32. All of which make it even harder to believe in the reality of this alternate future which doesn't look like the future to begin with.With regard to the quality of the performances, while most of the actors involved could be described as adequate, the performances vary between the painfully stilted (Timberlake) and the hopelessly bland (everyone else). I place the blame for most of this at the feet of Niccol as director and screenwriter. It is to Cillian Murphy's credit as an actor that he manages to rise above the problems of the weak script and the haphazard direction to give a truly memorable performance, turning what could have been a bland and cliched role into a riveting presence that dominates every scene he's in. Murphy's Timekeeper is a futuristic Javert, an unbending and relentless enforcer of the law whose integrity is grounded in a firm belief in the rightness of the system and of his role in it. When he's on the screen, the film comes alive around him. When he's not, it just drifts and careens from one pointless and reason-defying sequence to the next.In retrospect, I'd say that Murphy delivers two reasons (besides a memorable performance) that someone might want to actually see this film. If you want to know the difference between a celebrity (Timberlake) and a real actor (Murphy) and why that difference matters, this film is a perfect example. And if you want to see what a skilled and committed actor can do even when handed a lame script and a director who seemingly has gone absent from the set, Murphy's Timekeeper really sets the bar.Except for the core idea and for Cillian Murphy's performance, not really recommended unless you can watch it for free and have nothing else better to do with your time.",2,A great idea

1416372,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,B004LWZW7E,William Timothy Lukeman,"[0, 0]","Andrew Niccol's small oeuvre as a filmmaker deals with pressing contemporary concerns, but usually in an allegorical framework. ""In Time"" is in that vein: in the future, a genetically-modified humanity uses time as money, with the rich potentially immortal, and the rest hardscrabbling for another hour or even a handful of minutes every day. In short, what life is increasingly becoming like for all of us today, as the gap between the 99% & the 1% grows wider & wider -- the poor struggle & die so that the rich live may in obscene comfort.Niccol begins promisingly by touching on some of the issues such a culture would raise: the anomie & fear of risk-taking that would cocoon the rich, creating a stagnant society averse to creativity & change; the psychological & emotional jarring of having several generations in a family all looking 25 years old; the emphasis on speed & doing things among the poor, leaving no time for contemplation because everything is focused on the next few minutes, rather than on the long-term. So far, so good.Even the hero-bucks-the-system aspect of the film begins well, as protagonist Will Salas uses an unexpected gift of time given in response to his compassion to challenge the powers-that-be. The problem arises when the film starts becoming too much of a chase/action film. Granted, part of this was obviously intentional, to emphasize the need for people to keep moving constantly, unable to stop & think for any length of time. But I think it was also done intentionally to make the film more blatantly commercial, as the ads emphasized the action, the better to draw in more viewers who don't necessarily want to have to think about what they're watching. This is a delicate balance, and for me it never quite fell into place. I wanted more exploration of the ideas than I got -- though I'll admit that they kept the suspense cranked up quite well. It's just that the film tends to get a bit too slick & glib when it should be evoking a deeper emotional response instead, as Niccol's previous ""Gattaca"" did.Still, even with that shortcoming, it's a film worth watching & pondering afterwards. The parallels to contemporary life are clear & upsetting, as they're meant to be.

At first glance via the trailer, I figured it would be just one of those sci-fi action flicks. Big deal. But then, I saw that it was written, directed, and produced by Andrew Niccol, who also did the films like ""The Truman Show,"" ""Gattaca"", ""S1m0ne,"" and ""Lord of War."" So, I gave it a watch-ahead.It takes place in the year 2161 when a genetic alteration has allowed humanity to stop aging at 25 but the people are required to earn more time after turning 25 or die within a year. ""Time"" has now become a world-wide currency. There is something called ""Living Time,"" which can to be transferred from individual to individual. And, one can see their own time's availability as displayed on an implant on their arms. So, when that clock reaches zero, you die instantly. The more ""time"" you earn, trade, or even steal, the more you survive. You have to ""pay"" with your ""time,"" such as a bus fare, a meal, a rent, etc.The society appears to be divided based on how much ""time"" you have. The rich have more time than the ""poor"" whom have to live day to day to keep earning ""times"" or they would die. The rich of course just live their life without worrying about dying and plans to be ""immortals."" You can live up to 105 or 2,000 and still looks like 25.There is an interesting catch phrase in this film where a ""rich"" character has said to Will (played by Timberlake): ""For few to be immortal, many must die."" That, to me, implies a huge ""time"" or energy drain from the ""poor people,"" who had to die, so that rich can live forever. In the ""poor"" areas, the prices has been increasing enough to the point that the people cannot even pay anything with their ""time,"" so they'd died. The more they die, the ""rich"" endures. That is what Will do not want to have happened - so he sought out to ""drain"" the immortals from their ""time"" and distribute it among the poor (and of course collapse the ""System"" in the process).This film has that somewhat a typical theme such as hero meets the girl, they are being chased by a bad guy (Timekeeper), who didn't win in the end (there is a twist in this regard), and the hero and the girl moving on together to rob more ""Time banks.""It may have been based on some science fiction novels or elements, but I've found this film to be interesting. The lesson is, of course, don't waste any ""time"" or letting others to waste/steal yours.",5,An Interesting Film,1356739200,"12 29, 2012",2012,2414,"['have', 'watched', 'Time', 'DVD', 'number', 'times', 'first', 'glance', 'trailer', 'figured', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'one', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'flicks', 'Big', 'deal', 'then', 'saw', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'produced', 'Andrew', 'Niccol', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'films', 'Truman', 'Show', 'Gattaca', 'S1m0ne', 'Lord', 'War', 'gave', 'watch-ahead.It', 'place', 'year', '2161', 'when', 'genetic', 'alteration', 'allowed', 'humanity', 'stop', 'aging', '25', 'people', 'are', 'required', 'earn', 'more', 'time', 'turning', '25', 'die', 'year', 'Time', 'now', 'become', 'world-wide', 'currency', 'something', 'called', 'Living', 'Time', 'can', 'be', 'transferred', 'individual', 'individual', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'own', 'time', 'availability', 'displayed', 'implant', 'arms', 'So', 'when', 'clock', 'zero', 'die', 'instantly', 'more', 'time', 'earn', 'trade', 'even', 'steal', 'more', 'survive', 'have', 'pay', 'time', 'such', 'bus', 'fare', 'meal', 'rent', 'etc.The', 'society', 'be', 'divided', 'based', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'have', 'rich', 'have', 'more', 'time', 'poor', 'whom', 'have', 'live', 'day', 'day', 'keep', 'earning', 'times', 'would', 'die', 'rich', 'course', 'just', 'live', 'life', 'worrying', 'dying', 'plans', 'be', 'immortals', 'can', 'live', 'up', '105', '2,000', 'still', '25.There', 'interesting', 'catch', 'phrase', 'film', 'where', 'rich', 'character', 'said', 'Will', 'played', 'Timberlake', 'few', 'be', 'immortal', 'many', 'must', 'die', 'huge', 'time', 'energy', 'drain', 'poor', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'die', 'rich', 'can', 'live', 'forever', 'poor', 'areas', 'prices', 'been', 'increasing', 'enough', 'point', 'people', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'pay', 'anything', 'time', ""'d"", 'died', 'more', 'die', 'rich', 'endures', 'what', 'Will', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'have', 'happened', 'so', 'sought', 'out', 'drain', 'immortals', 'time', 'distribute', 'poor', 'course', 'collapse', 'System', 'process', '.This', 'film', 'somewhat', 'typical', 'theme', 'such', 'hero', 'girl', 'are', 'being', 'chased', 'bad', 'guy', 'Timekeeper', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'end', 'twist', 'regard', 'hero', 'girl', 'moving', 'together', 'rob', 'more', 'Time', 'banks', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'based', 'science', 'fiction', 'novels', 'elements', ""'ve"", 'found', 'film', 'be', 'interesting', 'lesson', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'letting', 'others', 'waste/steal', 'yours']",In Time
1416375,A12LKEM543ILBK,B004LWZW7E,zombie phreak,"[1, 2]","I didn't get a chance to see this in theaters so I had to do what I usually do, good ol' Redbox to the rescue!***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***Okay so somehow ALL the nations of the world decided to change currency to time.  Really?  We can't even get all the nations of the world to agree on where to hold the Olympics without it devolving into an argument that goes nowhere and ends up being investigated by a committee that's filibustered until it dies in a sub-committee.  And somehow ALLLLLL the nations of the world said, ""Yes, let's get rid of monetary standards and currency that we've used for hundreds of years, re-write the DNA of the ENTIRE population of the planet so they die at 26 unless they work and get more time.""Also, we're still arguing about cloning and we've been arguing about that since like the 90's and we're STILL no closer to resolving that argument, but somehow this got approved on a GLOBAL scale and put into effect.  And NOBODY said, ""Wait a minute... what are we doing again?"" NOBODY said, ""Wait a minute, this is COMPLETELY unconstitutional and TOTALLY violates human rights and is COMPLETELY unbalanced and favors the rich in every way shape and form, this can't be allowed!""Okay well I can move past that and get to the rest of the things in this movie that were stupid.So this main character, has a secret to success!  He let's his own clock run down to a few seconds when he's in a fight so the other person doesn't pay attention to their own clock on their arm, so that's when he makes his move.  And NO ONE else on the planet has figured this out?  Sure, why not?  On top of that he's in a high stakes poker game and he's playing for like a 1,000 years or something as the wager and he is down to his last few seconds and the rich guy is like, ""Looks like you're all in...""  And he reveals his cards.  Okay, first of all, anyone with half a friggin' BRAIN in their skull would see that and think, ""Okay I just have to stall for a few seconds, he'll be dead and I get to take the pot.""  All he'd have to do is look at his cards, put on his ""thinking face,"" and say, ""gimme a minute, hmmm... let me see... what should I do... hmmm... *THUD* What happened?  He's dead?  Oh, guess that means I win!""So Will decides that he is going to take down the system with the help of the rich guy's daughter who is played by Amanda Seyfried, and frankly I think she did a pretty decent job of playing her character in this movie.  And their secret to taking down the system is to crash a car into a bank and steal the time there.Really?This time currency system has been going on for probably over 100 years now and they just NOW figured out the concept of robbing a bank?  They just now figured out, ""Hey, we want what they have, we have some guns, let's go in there, wave our guns around menacingly and threaten to shoot them if they don't give us what we want and then take what we want!""  It took the people of this planet over 100 years to figure that out!?!  The human race figured that crap out back in the Stone Age!  Some guy was squatting in a cave somewhere and said, ""Ogg hungry, Gorg have food, Ogg want food, Ogg take Gorg's food!""  And now hundreds of thousands of years later these people just now rediscovered this concept?  Plus there's no guards there?  Again, these intelligent human beings that run these banks don't think, ""Hey we've got some stuff here that is valuable and other people want it.  Maybe we should put some, oh I don't know... GUARDS with WEAPONS in here that can defend the place in case someone breaks in and tries to rob the place, we can fight them off and protect the valuable things we have!  No one thought to do this!?!The movie ends with these two characters walking into something that looks like it might be the Federal Reserve and they each have pistols with them.  I was thinking, ""I'm pretty sure this place will have more security than that two-bit bank branch that you robbed in the ghetto.""  But I guess that would require the writer of this to THINK.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***Even with all those things, this was still entertaining, I liked the acting, I liked the car chases and the drama was good.
