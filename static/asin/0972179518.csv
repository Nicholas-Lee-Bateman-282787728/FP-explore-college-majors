There's some basic information about the theory behind these methods, and some very helpful advice on what doesn't work, and things that work but can lead to bad habits.And that's really all there is to it.  If that doesn't seem like a lot, when then you obviously haven't had to deal with an infant that cries at all hours turning your entire house into sleepless zombies.  I have.  It isn't pretty.Incidentally, the DVD is MUCH MUCH better than the book.  In fact, don't bother with the book at all.  Watching the video gives you in a few seconds what it takes 5 pages to get from the book.The DVD also includes an extended Q&A; session with the doctor and some womb noises (which did nothing for our kids, but might work for yours).For the last two years, this has been the gift we give at showers because while you might not need it, if you do the DVD is worth its weight in gold.",4,"Not a cure-all, but it works.

I just gave this one, and also included a copy of the book, in case they need to make notes.Getting right to the point, the Dr. Karp explains that in many cultures a baby is carried with its mother, as she goes through her day. They are carried in slings They can suck their mothers breast at anytime. The author says that this constant motion and constant body contact, along with the snug sheet, making the baby feel secure as it mimics the conditions in the womb.He goes on to say that months 0-3 of baby's life are the missing &#34;fourth trimester&#34;, hence his methods of the following the 5 S's work well, since they imitate the womb environment:1. Swaddle - he describes and illustrates an excellent swaddle technique, the tighter, the more womb-like2. Side / Stomach - laying baby on side or stomach.3. Shush - I found this one interesting as you always hear parents saying that to there baby. He says it is mimicking the sound of the blood flow the baby heard for 9 months! He also suggests turning on a vacuum...same sound.4. Swinging - rhythmic, jiggling motion. That simulates movement in the womb.5. Suck - sucking on a pacifier, nipple, your finger, etc...The idea is these five things is they all initiate the calming reflex in the baby. Of course he goes into much more detail, which I found very interesting.

Our 5 week old son has been keeping us up at nights and during the day (but don't get me wrong, we're still getting SOME sleep). The methods that Dr. Karp suggests through this video don't always work for us, but they definitely put new tools in our belt when trying to make our baby ""happy."" But this, my friends, is not the beauty of this video. The real power of this video is that it covers everything you need to hear in about 30 minutes. So even if these methods don't work for you after watching this video, realize that you (should) have only invested less than an hour in learning them.Still, a lot of what Dr. Harvey Karp describes seems like common sense in retrospect. When you think of everything new a baby is experiencing, it only makes sense to try to recreate the ""womb experience."" Like I said, these methods don't work 100% of the time for us, but in the short time we've used them, they work a majority of the time. A few examples:1. We were told that some babies don't like to be swaddled and thought that ours was one of them. We also thought that we had a good swaddling method. After a few pointers from THBotB, we've come to find that our child likes swaddling a little more than we thought, plus we learned to tweak the method we had.2. When I first heard the ""Shush"" technique on the DVD, I honestly thought that some audio engineer didn't do his job correctly. As the dialogue went on, I found that he actually meant to shush very loudly. I've found that this is sometimes the only thing I need to do with our son.3. He uses this ""jiggling,"" technique that you really have to see to believe. All I can say is that when we swaddle our son, jiggling really works well.Again, a lot of these were things we were already doing - maybe they're things you're already doing; but it's a great perspective that may help to tweak your methods for the better as it did ours.",5,Wonderful DVD,1293840000,"01 1, 2011",2011,1980,"['video', 'was', 'definitely', 'made', 'consideration', 'desperate', 'semi-desperate', 'parents', '5', 'week', 'old', 'son', 'been', 'keeping', 'up', 'nights', 'day', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""'re"", 'still', 'getting', 'SOME', 'sleep', 'methods', 'Dr.', 'Karp', 'video', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'definitely', 'put', 'new', 'tools', 'belt', 'when', 'trying', 'make', 'baby', 'happy', 'friends', 'not', 'beauty', 'video', 'real', 'power', 'video', 'everything', 'need', 'hear', 'about', '30', 'minutes', 'So', 'even', 'methods', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'watching', 'video', 'realize', 'should', 'have', 'only', 'invested', 'less', 'hour', 'learning', 'them.Still', 'lot', 'what', 'Dr.', 'Harvey', 'Karp', 'common', 'sense', 'retrospect', 'When', 'think', 'everything', 'new', 'baby', 'experiencing', 'only', 'sense', 'try', 'recreate', 'womb', 'experience', 'said', 'methods', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', '100', '%', 'time', 'short', 'time', ""'ve"", 'used', 'work', 'majority', 'time', 'few', 'examples:1', 'were', 'told', 'babies', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'be', 'swaddled', 'thought', 'ours', 'was', 'one', 'also', 'thought', 'had', 'good', 'swaddling', 'method', 'few', 'pointers', 'THBotB', ""'ve"", 'come', 'find', 'child', 'swaddling', 'little', 'more', 'thought', 'learned', 'tweak', 'method', 'had.2', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'Shush', 'technique', 'DVD', 'honestly', 'thought', 'audio', 'engineer', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'job', 'correctly', 'dialogue', 'went', 'found', 'actually', 'meant', 'shush', 'very', 'loudly', ""'ve"", 'found', 'sometimes', 'only', 'thing', 'need', 'do', 'son.3', 'jiggling', 'technique', 'really', 'have', 'see', 'believe', 'can', 'say', 'when', 'swaddle', 'son', 'jiggling', 'really', 'well.Again', 'lot', 'were', 'things', 'were', 'already', 'doing', 'maybe', ""'re"", 'things', ""'re"", 'already', 'doing', 'great', 'perspective', 'may', 'help', 'tweak', 'methods', 'better', 'did']",N/A

Think of all the sleep you could be getting when your baby is fast asleep too.Dr. Harvey Karp is simply a miracle worker. You will be amazed at how easily he calms babies so they no longer cry and actually fall asleep very quickly. He doesn't just tell you what to do; he demonstrates the techniques you need to learn to have a much happier baby. As long as you can remember the 5 S's he demonstrates you can calm your baby easily anywhere.That is of course possible if your baby is not hungry or needs to be burped. This DVD does not explain all the things you should check first before trying the methods Dr. Karp presents. I think this DVD could be improved if it also explained what foods a mother should avoid while breastfeeding.From my own research: If your baby is colicky stop feeding him/her apple juice. My mother claimed that I had colic as a baby because she was eating apples with the skin on. I've read online that eating apples can be a problem if you are breastfeeding. Spicy foods and dairy products may also be culprits.

I care more about having the knowledge to comfort my baby than anything else. The DVD isn't that long, so watch it immediately. We did even while our daughter was screaming her head off. We brought her into the living room and started the process of the swaddling etc, and she was out in just a few minutes. This DVD teaches you not how to put your baby to sleep, but how to calm them which will induce a deeper sleep, help them nap, and sleep more at night. Our new baby had slept no more than two hours max per night and we are at 7 weeks old at time of purchase. She slept 4 hours the first night and has every night since then, sometimes with a second three hour stretch right behind it. Practice the methods you'll get it. Don't give up. We have used it over and over, even when it was hard to get her calm, but if you don't stop trying you'll get there. I highly recommend this for new parents to buy for themselves or as a shower gift. The new mother will love you for it! The earlier you can start his methods the better!",5,Lifesaver for new parents!,1399161600,"05 4, 2014",2014,1118,"['one', 'thing', 'wish', 'someone', 'would', 'have', 'purchased', 'practical', 'care', 'more', 'having', 'knowledge', 'comfort', 'baby', 'anything', 'else', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'that', 'long', 'so', 'watch', 'immediately', 'did', 'even', 'daughter', 'was', 'screaming', 'head', 'brought', 'living', 'room', 'started', 'process', 'swaddling', 'etc', 'was', 'out', 'just', 'few', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'teaches', 'not', 'how', 'put', 'baby', 'sleep', 'how', 'calm', 'will', 'induce', 'deeper', 'sleep', 'help', 'nap', 'sleep', 'more', 'night', 'new', 'baby', 'had', 'slept', 'no', 'more', 'two', 'hours', 'max', 'night', 'are', '7', 'weeks', 'old', 'time', 'purchase', 'slept', '4', 'hours', 'first', 'night', 'night', 'then', 'sometimes', 'second', 'three', 'hour', 'stretch', 'right', 'Practice', 'methods', ""'ll"", 'get', 'Do', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'have', 'used', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'hard', 'get', 'calm', 'do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'trying', ""'ll"", 'get', 'there', 'highly', 'recommend', 'new', 'parents', 'buy', 'shower', 'gift', 'new', 'mother', 'will', 'love', 'earlier', 'can', 'start', 'methods', 'better']",N/A
