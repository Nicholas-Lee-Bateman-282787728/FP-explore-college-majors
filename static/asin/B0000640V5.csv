697606,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B0000640V5,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","God's Gun, 1975 filmThe movie starts with a puppet show for children. A gang of men ride into town shooting pistols and entering the bank to rob it. Some men enter a hotel and grab a woman. The townsmen grab rifles and shoot at the gang to protect their local bank (and economy). There are casualties. The gang then rides out of town. Next we see a church and its minister. A young boy wants to shoot a gun. A dozen men ride into town. The saloon has dancing girls and gambling. Young Johnny walks into the saloon. ""This is a respectable place."" A thrown knife stops discord over a card hand. Self-defense? Those dozen men ride out of town. Jenny asks the men to do something about the Clayton gang. That minister decides to ride after them. He disarms them as they sleep in daylight. [Believable?] He invites one back to Juno City. The Sheriff smells trouble in this.The prisoner in the jail awaits his trial. But his gang comes to town to free him! They shoot that minister. Johnny cries. Clayton is now the leader of the town. Who stole that horse? Three men chase him. One follows him up a tower. A mistake? The gang takes over the town. Johnny visits another town and sees a surprise! Clayton decides to redistribute the loot. We learn about the brother of that minister. Johnny draws a picture to explain. The Marshal and his men ride into Juno City. They are given a story to send them away. The gang double-crosses the judge, then go to the saloon for their amusement. [This won't be shown on broadcast TV.] Clayton laughs. A woman reminds him of his past! Clayton laughs again. A yell from a falling man brings a surprise. ""He's come back!"" The bell on the church tolls. Two men enter the church and regret it. Two more fall into this trap. Clayton calls for Johnny.A man with a long coat approaches from the end of the street. One man doesn't leave. A dancing girl pays him off. The last man is captured by the Sheriff. Clayton arrives at a cemetery and digs up the loot of paper money. [They used gold and silver for currency in those days. A dropped coin is not blown away by the wind.] He dreams of a happy life ahead. But that minister shows up to surprise Clayton. The bell tolls again. ""Mine is the vengeance."" It ends as you would expect. The bad guy is cured of his wrongdoing. Johnny gets his gun. [So who got the money?]This is less than average story but it is unintentionally funny in parts. It is a European version of a western adventure story set in the late 19th century. Does it remind you of some story from antiquity or an opera? Note how the actors in some scenes have inappropriate smiles, as if they are amused. The story has implausible parts. Can you identify some actors as European by their faces?",1,Crime and Punishment,1339372800,"06 11, 2012",2012,2733,"['God', 'Gun', '1975', 'filmThe', 'movie', 'puppet', 'show', 'children', 'gang', 'men', 'ride', 'town', 'shooting', 'pistols', 'entering', 'bank', 'rob', 'men', 'enter', 'hotel', 'grab', 'woman', 'townsmen', 'grab', 'rifles', 'shoot', 'gang', 'protect', 'local', 'bank', 'economy', 'are', 'casualties', 'gang', 'then', 'town', 'see', 'church', 'minister', 'young', 'boy', 'shoot', 'gun', 'dozen', 'men', 'ride', 'town', 'saloon', 'dancing', 'girls', 'gambling', 'Young', 'Johnny', 'saloon', 'respectable', 'place', 'thrown', 'knife', 'stops', 'discord', 'card', 'hand', 'Self-defense', 'dozen', 'men', 'ride', 'town', 'Jenny', 'men', 'do', 'something', 'Clayton', 'gang', 'minister', 'decides', 'ride', 'sleep', 'daylight', 'Believable', ']', 'one', 'back', 'Juno', 'City', 'Sheriff', 'trouble', 'this.The', 'prisoner', 'jail', 'trial', 'gang', 'town', 'free', 'shoot', 'minister', 'Johnny', 'cries', 'Clayton', 'now', 'leader', 'town', 'Who', 'stole', 'horse', 'Three', 'men', 'chase', 'One', 'up', 'tower', 'mistake', 'gang', 'town', 'Johnny', 'town', 'surprise', 'Clayton', 'redistribute', 'loot', 'learn', 'brother', 'minister', 'Johnny', 'picture', 'explain', 'Marshal', 'men', 'ride', 'Juno', 'City', 'are', 'given', 'story', 'send', 'away', 'gang', 'judge', 'then', 'go', 'saloon', 'amusement', '[', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'shown', 'broadcast', 'TV', 'Clayton', 'woman', 'past', 'Clayton', 'again', 'A', 'yell', 'falling', 'man', 'surprise', 'come', 'back', 'bell', 'church', 'tolls', 'Two', 'men', 'enter', 'church', 'regret', 'Two', 'more', 'fall', 'trap', 'Clayton', 'Johnny.A', 'man', 'long', 'coat', 'approaches', 'end', 'street', 'One', 'man', ""n't"", 'leave', 'dancing', 'girl', 'off', 'last', 'man', 'captured', 'Sheriff', 'Clayton', 'cemetery', 'digs', 'up', 'loot', 'paper', 'money', 'used', 'gold', 'silver', 'currency', 'days', 'dropped', 'coin', 'not', 'blown', 'away', 'wind', 'happy', 'life', 'ahead', 'minister', 'up', 'surprise', 'Clayton', 'bell', 'again', 'Mine', 'vengeance', 'would', 'expect', 'bad', 'guy', 'cured', 'wrongdoing', 'Johnny', 'gun', 'So', 'who', 'got', 'money', ']', 'less', 'average', 'story', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'parts', 'European', 'version', 'western', 'adventure', 'story', 'set', 'late', '19th', 'century', 'remind', 'story', 'antiquity', 'opera', 'Note', 'how', 'actors', 'scenes', 'have', 'inappropriate', 'smiles', 'are', 'amused', 'story', 'implausible', 'parts', 'Can', 'identify', 'actors', 'European']",N/A

Dibert ""the wessel DVD Collector and ...","[0, 0]","TITLE: This picture was released in theaters in March of 1978 starring a very young but gorgeous Sybil Danning as Jenny, Lee Van Cleef as Father John and Lewis and Jack Palace as Sam Clayton.SUMMARY: Picture starts in a little called Crane City where a Mexican is putting on a puppet show. As he starts to collect money, you hear gunshots coming from behind his wagon. Sam Clayton and his gang has just rode into Crane City where they terrorist the woman rob the bank and kill the sheriff and the deputy. A few days later Sam Clayton and his thugs ride into Juno City. Enters Sybil Danning who's playing the role of Jenny and she runs the only saloon in town. Also living with her is her son Johnny. Enters Lee Van Cleef who's the Priest or otherwise called Father John. Father John and Johnny are walking down the street when Jenny asks Johnny if he finished shining the glasses. Father John tells Jenny that Johnny will be back to finish shinning the glasses after he's done cleaning the church. While cleaning the church Johnny comes across a gun that belongs to Fathers John Brother Lewis. Sam is in Jenny saloon when Johnny walks in. Sam wonders while Johnny isn't in school. Sam also wants to know where Johnny's father is. Meanwhile at table a couple of Sam's thugs are playing poker when one of them is accused of cheating. Sam's nephew throws a knife in the back of the poker player that was cheating. As a man lying died in jenny saloon Sam Clayton and his gang start to ride out of town. Jenny is screaming at the people of the town for someone to go after Sam Clayton's nephew to bring him back to for justice. When the sheriff decides that he's not going Father John takes the sheriffs horse and rides out after Sam Clayton gang. That's leaves two unanswered questions.QUESTIONS: What does the title God's Gun stand for? What does Father John comeback to town with Sam Clayton's nephew? MY THOUGHTS: I thought this was an excellent picture. Lee Van Cleef does an excellent job playing the role of Father John and the role of Lewis. Jack Palace was excellent in his role as Sam Clayton. The reason I bought this movie was Sybil Danning. You didn't see much of Sybil Danning body in this because it was a western but, she was excellent in her role as Jenny the owner of the saloon. Her talents as an actress really shined in this picture. So, with that in mind, and because this movie kept my interest through the entire picture I'm giving this movie 5 weasels stars because of Sybil Danning and the level of action , adventure and drama this movie had from beginning to end.

Grandcolas ""Stiggs""","[1, 1]","What potential - A great title ""Gods Gun"" - three of the best tough guys ever, all with very respectable careers - Lee Van Cleef, Jack Palance and Richard Boone. What is right? Jack Palance comes off OK. At times there are some clever script elements. That's it!What's Wrong? What ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"" was to Bella Lagosi, ""Gods Gun"" might be to these three actors. ""Gods Gun"" rivals Terror In Tiny Town in ineptitude. The actors in this Israeli - no budget Western must have been very hungry. You watch this film and wonder - how did this happen to them?Van Cleef (who must have had the worlds worst agent), had all but lost his menacing charm. At this time in his career you wonder if directors were purposely mocking him -having him wear embarrassing costumes, wigs and at times singing awful theme songs. He must have realized he wasn't getting paid for this abomination because he obviously didn't stick around to loop in his own voice. He is ludicrously dubbed to sound like ""A Sons of Hercules"" character.Cheep sets, lame clich&eacute;d music, horrendously bad costumes, awful peripheral actors, stereotypes, and a bland and confused teen idle - Leif Garret.The whole thing would be unintentionally funny if it were not for the sadness of seeing three quality actors trying desperately to make this thing work. At least you don't feel so bad about Palance who went on to some better things - some quality Hollywood films and push-ups during an Academy Award ceremony.It is very disturbing watching Van Cleef, and Boone knowing that for the remainder of their lives they were hopelessly stuck in poverty row films like this one.""Gods Gun"" has a very high cringe factor for those of us who were once entertained by these guys.
