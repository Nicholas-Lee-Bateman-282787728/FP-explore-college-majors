The Season One release was great - excellent sound and picture quality, cast interviews, an interview with Majel and Gene Roddenberry's son, and other extras; so when Season Two was released, I didn't hesitate to order it.  I wish I hadn't.  There are no subtitles or closed captioning available on the set, and the sound quality is so poor on some of the episodes that it is difficult to understand the dialogue.  There are no extras either.  I'd hoped for interviews with some of the cast who were not included in Season One - people like Leni Parker, Anita LaSelva, Robert Leeshock, Kari Matchett.  Not a one.  The only reason I gave this set a 3 is that the show deserves it even if the set doesn't.",3,Disappointing DVD set,1284336000,"09 13, 2010",2010,789,"['was', 'so', 'happy', 'learn', 'Earth', 'Final', 'Conflict', 'was', 'finally', 'being', 'released', 'DVD', 'Season', 'One', 'release', 'was', 'great', 'excellent', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'cast', 'interviews', 'interview', 'Majel', 'Gene', 'Roddenberry', 'son', 'other', 'extras', 'so', 'when', 'Season', 'Two', 'was', 'released', 'did', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'order', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'are', 'subtitles', 'closed', 'captioning', 'available', 'set', 'sound', 'quality', 'so', 'poor', 'episodes', 'difficult', 'understand', 'dialogue', 'are', 'extras', 'either', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'interviews', 'cast', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'included', 'Season', 'One', 'people', 'Leni', 'Parker', 'Anita', 'LaSelva', 'Robert', 'Leeshock', 'Kari', 'Matchett', 'Not', 'one', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', 'set', '3', 'show', 'even', 'set', ""n't""]",N/A

1375965,A2W8VB44L96YE3,B003Y7JWZ0,Criosa,"[0, 3]",This was the best season of Earth Final Conflict with Season 2 being next best.  After that the series loses its way and never really ends properly.  But if you want to begin the journey Gene Roddenberry intended Seasons 1 and 2 would be good to watch as long as you do not mind never getting to the end. The new V series reminds me of how Earth Final Conflict started out.  Will be interesting to see if it loses its way also.,5,Best Season,1293667200,"12 30, 2010",2010,427,"['was', 'best', 'season', 'Earth', 'Final', 'Conflict', 'Season', '2', 'being', 'next', 'best', 'series', 'way', 'never', 'really', 'properly', 'want', 'begin', 'journey', 'Gene', 'Roddenberry', 'intended', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'watch', 'as', 'long', 'do', 'not', 'mind', 'never', 'getting', 'end', 'new', 'V', 'series', 'how', 'Earth', 'Final', 'Conflict', 'started', 'out', 'Will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'way', 'also']",N/A

The series concept was well-thought out and the sets and special effects were great.  Often, sci-fi movies/series can be cheesy with sub-standard music and dialogue, but it's easy to get caught up in and remain fascinated by this series.  What's really good is that since there are so many different plots going on in the series,the intro to each episode connects what's about to be shown with what has already transpired in that plot line.
