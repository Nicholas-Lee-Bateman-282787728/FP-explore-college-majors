And if you like oldies songs, you will really like this one; you can even sing along!  If you've never done a Richard Simmons dvd, you'll see that he repeats the dance steps.  So if you didn't catch on the first time, you have another chance at it.  And remember that nobody's watching you, so just have fun trying!  Also, some of his exercise dvds have floor exercises at the end, but this one does not.

The songs are great in this 5th edition of Sweatin' to the Oldies and the exercise routines are top-notch!!  You need to do this workout a few times before you get used to the moves.  The only reason I don't give this five stars total is because I can't hear the music!  It is overpowered by the dancers screaming, whooping and hollering during the workout.  For me, this is a distraction, although not a major one.  Its just something one needs to get used to.  All in all if you want to get in shape, Richard Simmons is the one to help you do it!!

1348056,A2QYV7LL3OCXJ,B003KIAWOS,R Helen,"[1, 1]","I absolutely loved the first four of Richard Simmons' ""Sweatin'"" series, and I was so excited to see that he just produced another one. Unfortunately, this one does not appeal to me like the others did. The set seems to be a street party I guess, and the music has moved to the seventies, but it is not live music this time, and there are too many people standing around watching that it can be distracting. Also, Richard has updated the dance moves to appeal to younger and more hipper audiences, but I liked the old style better. The dance moves are not difficult, but they are a bit harder than the last videos and it takes some time to get to know them. The video isn't bad really, but I was hoping for one similar to the last four, and so this is somewhat disappointing. Just on its own, though, it is a fun workout and Richard has a fun and motivating personality, so if you're the type who has a difficulty getting up and exercising, than you may just find that this is the perfect video. I do notice, however, that there doesn't seem to be as great a range of body types in this video and there seem to be less ""regular"" people. Perhaps this has to do with the fact that the steps are harder, and it is much more like dancing. Good video and for Richard fans, I would recommend it. If Richard has never appealed to you, you might give this a try.

1348057,A1KQVDBCSCTUSF,B003KIAWOS,"Rick Ven ""Classic TV addict""","[1, 1]","I have enjoyed all the ""Sweatin"" series. This one, as well, is no disappointment. #5 is much like the others in that you have a variety of exercisers going through the routine with you. The only thing missing on this from the others is the musicians. Although they may have lip synced the voices and instruments, the arrangements were very interesting and unique. #5, lacks in that tradition. In fact, I think it bends to the other direction where one Jackson 5 song has the vocalist sounding like Mickey Mouse with Laryngitis! All of the music is canned recreations of the original hits lacking that ""live"" feeling you got from the previous programs.For those who want to begin on an exercsise program and need a program that is holistic in nature, I recommend any of Richard's DVDs. He always brings you through a well rounded program of warm up, stretches, and aerobic activities all in a fun way. AND, he takes into consideration the people like us that are not in the best of shape nor olympic trainers; just average folk trying to keep their body limber and toned as we age.Age, it is for all ages. None of the movements are difficult.I highly recommend the program as a whole. This version is a low impact aerobic program. That is, you do not do any jumping or leaping. Every move is based on having one or both feet on the ground at all times; another benefit if you are just starting out.Best wishes to you and your road to good health.
