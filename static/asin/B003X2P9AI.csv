Unfortunately, it's the daughter who's a monster and a total drag, while her mom is the life of any party.

I think this would be considered a mediocre role for Baranski, who has done many other better roles.  She isn't a bad actor, but when I'm used to seeing her in a comedy this felt uncomfortable watching her play such a desperate character.  The movie has some racier moments (a nightclub & a bar scene) as one reviewer said, so it is not a family movie for young kids.  This would be one you may watch once a year during Christmas, but most people would not watch it numerous times like It's a Wonderful Life.  It's a Lifetime movie--not the best, and not the worst.
