396679,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,6304026285,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[0, 1]","Have you ever watched one of the numerous Hong Kong or Chinese made movies where the various characters defy gravity, performing stunts like those in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""?  This movie is a lot like those, but without resorting to the stunts that overcome the laws of physics.I had to watch the movie twice because I missed a key connection at the beginning.  Even catching on to the connection, portions of the movie remain a bit murky and the plot flow is somewhat jerky.  The movie begins with The (Evil) Master and his henchmen chasing after three individuals.  One of these individuals has an injured leg and escapes thanks to the self-sacrifice of the other two individuals, both of whom are killed.We immediately jump to a long-haired, young Jacky Chan (yes, that's the way it was spelled in the credits) performing some sort of practice Kung-Fu routine for his grandfather.  From this point forward, the movie plays like The Three Kung-Fu Stooges.  I have to admit that as bad as the acting and the dubbing was, I laughed throughout this portion of the movie because it was funny.  It was stupid, but it was funny too.  The dubbing is atrocious, with weird English accents for each of the Chinese actors.  This movie could definitely use a re-dub.I enjoyed the martial arts throughout this movie because they all appeared real.  I cringed when the actors fought, because when they hit each other, they HIT EACH OTHER!  I can see where there had to have been a lot of bruises after each day of filming.  There was nothing fake about any of the fight scenes.  The actors' martial arts skills were very, very good.  However, the ""elderly"" martial artists looked like 20-something actors with white hair and eyebrows.We see Jackie's character as he goes through this interlude of comedy until The Master shows up and, by connecting the sign at Jackie's Kung Fu school to Jackie's grandfather, tracks him down and kills him.  There isn't really any justification given for tracking down and killing these people by The Master, so we have to accept on faith that there is some sort of vendetta or history we are not privy to.  Jackie tries to kill The Master, but of course does not.  Instead Jackie encounters The Unicorn, who has a gimpy leg (recalling the beginning of this review).  The Unicorn teaches Jacky a number of tricks and some really serious martial arts to go off and wreak vengeance on The Master and his henchmen.This movie is corny, the acting is weak and often excessively overdone, and the plot is formulaic.  However, it is still funny, and somehow it all works.  As long as you aren't expecting a serious Kung-Fu movie, and as long as you are expecting very light entertainment, and particularly if you are a fan of Jackie Chan, you might find this movie interesting.  Three stars because of the flaws, but I still like the movie and plan to watch it again.",3,Kung-Fu Comedy with a Young Jackie Chan,1048550400,"03 25, 2003",2003,2892,"['Have', 'ever', 'watched', 'one', 'numerous', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'Chinese', 'made', 'movies', 'where', 'various', 'characters', 'defy', 'gravity', 'performing', 'stunts', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'movie', 'lot', 'resorting', 'stunts', 'overcome', 'laws', 'physics.I', 'had', 'watch', 'movie', 'twice', 'missed', 'key', 'connection', 'beginning', 'Even', 'catching', 'connection', 'portions', 'movie', 'remain', 'bit', 'murky', 'plot', 'flow', 'somewhat', 'jerky', 'movie', 'Evil', 'Master', 'henchmen', 'chasing', 'three', 'individuals', 'One', 'individuals', 'injured', 'leg', 'thanks', 'self-sacrifice', 'other', 'two', 'individuals', 'whom', 'are', 'killed.We', 'immediately', 'jump', 'long-haired', 'young', 'Jacky', 'Chan', 'yes', 'way', 'was', 'spelled', 'credits', 'performing', 'sort', 'practice', 'Kung-Fu', 'routine', 'grandfather', 'point', 'forward', 'movie', 'Three', 'Kung-Fu', 'Stooges', 'have', 'admit', 'as', 'bad', 'acting', 'dubbing', 'was', 'laughed', 'portion', 'movie', 'was', 'funny', 'was', 'stupid', 'was', 'funny', 'too', 'dubbing', 'atrocious', 'weird', 'English', 'accents', 'Chinese', 'actors', 'movie', 'could', 'definitely', 'use', 're-dub.I', 'enjoyed', 'martial', 'movie', 'appeared', 'real', 'cringed', 'when', 'actors', 'fought', 'when', 'hit', 'other', 'HIT', 'EACH', 'OTHER', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'there', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'bruises', 'day', 'filming', 'was', 'nothing', 'fake', 'fight', 'scenes', 'actors', 'martial', 'arts', 'skills', 'were', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'However', 'elderly', 'martial', 'artists', 'looked', '20-something', 'actors', 'white', 'hair', 'eyebrows.We', 'see', 'Jackie', 'character', 'interlude', 'comedy', 'Master', 'up', 'connecting', 'sign', 'Jackie', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'school', 'Jackie', 'grandfather', 'down', ""n't"", 'really', 'justification', 'given', 'tracking', 'down', 'killing', 'people', 'Master', 'have', 'accept', 'faith', 'sort', 'vendetta', 'history', 'are', 'not', 'privy', 'Jackie', 'kill', 'Master', 'course', 'not', 'Instead', 'Jackie', 'Unicorn', 'who', 'gimpy', 'leg', 'recalling', 'beginning', 'review', 'Unicorn', 'teaches', 'Jacky', 'number', 'tricks', 'really', 'serious', 'martial', 'arts', 'go', 'off', 'wreak', 'vengeance', 'Master', 'henchmen.This', 'movie', 'corny', 'acting', 'weak', 'often', 'excessively', 'overdone', 'plot', 'formulaic', 'However', 'still', 'funny', 'somehow', 'As', 'long', 'are', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'serious', 'Kung-Fu', 'movie', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'expecting', 'very', 'light', 'entertainment', 'particularly', 'are', 'fan', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'might', 'find', 'movie', 'interesting', 'Three', 'stars', 'flaws', 'still', 'movie', 'plan', 'watch', 'again']",N/A
396680,ASFTYWTX1WWFE,6304026285,Shawn McKenna,"[0, 0]","Jackie Chan had just established his Hong Kong popularity with Seasonal Pictures Snake in Eagles Shadow and the sublime Drunken Master. With the success of those films Lo Wei, who lent him out to Seasonal, let Jackie have complete control over his next picture. Fearless Hyena would be Jackie's directorial debut - though he would be working with a much smaller budget than his Seasonal experience. He would also stunt coordinate and write this film too. This movie would out gross the stellar receipts of Drunken Master and help earn Jackie 6000 HK dollars (his pay was 3000 per film; though he made over 50000 on Drunken Master). This measly pay helped exacerbate the rift between him and Lo Wei which led to his departure and the infamous sequel.Jackie reprises his goofy student role that he played in Drunken Master. This time he is Shing Lung, a talented but capricious student and grandson of Chen Ping Fe (the ubiquitous James Tien). Lung would rather gamble or goof off then study his forms. Little does he know that his Grandfather is marked for death by Yen Ting Hua (the underrated Yam Sai-kwoon aka Yen Shi Kwan) who is trying to destroy the Sien Yi clan founded by Hiu Fei (I just love keeping track of these names, I do not know why). Though Shing is forbidden to teach (or show) the Kung Fu his grandfather teaches him he (of course) does it anyways.Shing tries to make his grandfather proud by getting a job selling coffins. The coffin dealer played by Dean Shek is an unscrupulous merchant who even sells secondhand coffins. This cameo plays to the strengths of Dean and is quite an interesting and hilarious scene. Hapless Shing blows this opportunity by trapping Dean in one of his favorite coffins. He runs away and while walking the public he is confronted by three ruffians (Great Bear, Stony Egg and Ironhead) he beat up earlier. They want him to teach them Kung Fu.Shing meets their Master Ti Cha who is in charge of the Everything Clan who has no actual skills except for scheming. Ti offers Lung a position and lots of money to help there school learn effective fighting techniques. Ti uses him in the old ploy as a lowly laborer to fight heads of other schools (so if the lowly laborer is that good, just imagine how good Master Ti is.) This leads to several excellent fight scenes that are incredibly fun to watch. I especially like when Shing fights the Lu Ying and the Willow Sword (using the Pink Panther theme as background music) as a cross-eyed beggar. He then fights a large albeit slow man as a woman (yes, Jackie in Drag and no he is not cute).Shing then makes a huge mistake by naming the facility under the Sien Yi name. Now the rest of the film is very predictable with the ultimate showdown between Shing Lung and Yen Ting Hua. The way it is handled though is quite sagacious. The training scenes are Jackie at his masochistic best. With him pulling huge sacks, doing amazing upside-down sit-ups with his new trainer the Unicorn having a sadistic gleam in his eyes. Shing is even taught Emotional Kung Fu (which Jackie made up for this film) using Joy, Anger, Sorrow and Happiness to focus on one's enemy ""emotional"" weak spot.One of my favorite scenes is the Dueling Chopsticks scene in which the Unicorn prevents Shing from eating by using his chopsticks (of course.) Unfortunately it has influenced me to be quite annoying and apply this whenever applicable.I would not rate this film as highly as Drunken Master. There are problems with the plot that takes too much from Drunken Master. However, I feel that this is an unheralded martial arts piece that is funny and exciting with excellent ideas and stunt choreography by Jackie Chan. This is also a must see if you want to watch Jackie in drag.",4,You can call me Rotten Egg!,1183420800,"07 3, 2007",2007,3742,"['Jackie', 'Chan', 'had', 'just', 'established', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'popularity', 'Seasonal', 'Pictures', 'Snake', 'Eagles', 'Shadow', 'sublime', 'Drunken', 'Master', 'success', 'films', 'Lo', 'Wei', 'who', 'lent', 'out', 'Seasonal', 'let', 'Jackie', 'have', 'complete', 'control', 'next', 'picture', 'Fearless', 'Hyena', 'would', 'be', 'Jackie', 'directorial', 'debut', 'would', 'be', 'working', 'much', 'smaller', 'budget', 'Seasonal', 'experience', 'would', 'also', 'stunt', 'coordinate', 'write', 'film', 'too', 'movie', 'would', 'out', 'gross', 'stellar', 'receipts', 'Drunken', 'Master', 'help', 'earn', 'Jackie', '6000', 'HK', 'dollars', 'pay', 'was', '3000', 'film', 'made', 'over', '50000', 'Drunken', 'Master', 'measly', 'pay', 'helped', 'exacerbate', 'rift', 'Lo', 'Wei', 'led', 'departure', 'infamous', 'sequel.Jackie', 'goofy', 'student', 'role', 'played', 'Drunken', 'Master', 'time', 'Shing', 'Lung', 'talented', 'capricious', 'student', 'grandson', 'Chen', 'Ping', 'Fe', 'ubiquitous', 'James', 'Tien', 'Lung', 'would', 'rather', 'gamble', 'goof', 'off', 'then', 'study', 'forms', 'Little', 'know', 'Grandfather', 'marked', 'death', 'Yen', 'Ting', 'Hua', 'underrated', 'Yam', 'Sai-kwoon', 'aka', 'Yen', 'Shi', 'Kwan', 'who', 'trying', 'destroy', 'Sien', 'Yi', 'clan', 'founded', 'Hiu', 'Fei', 'just', 'love', 'keeping', 'track', 'names', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'why', 'Shing', 'forbidden', 'teach', 'show', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'grandfather', 'course', 'anyways.Shing', 'tries', 'make', 'grandfather', 'proud', 'getting', 'job', 'selling', 'coffins', 'coffin', 'dealer', 'played', 'Dean', 'Shek', 'unscrupulous', 'merchant', 'who', 'even', 'secondhand', 'coffins', 'cameo', 'strengths', 'Dean', 'quite', 'interesting', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'Hapless', 'Shing', 'blows', 'opportunity', 'trapping', 'Dean', 'one', 'favorite', 'coffins', 'away', 'walking', 'public', 'confronted', 'three', 'ruffians', 'Great', 'Bear', 'Stony', 'Egg', 'Ironhead', 'beat', 'up', 'earlier', 'want', 'teach', 'Kung', 'Fu.Shing', 'meets', 'Master', 'Ti', 'Cha', 'who', 'charge', 'Everything', 'Clan', 'who', 'actual', 'skills', 'scheming', 'Ti', 'Lung', 'position', 'lots', 'money', 'help', 'there', 'school', 'learn', 'effective', 'fighting', 'techniques', 'Ti', 'old', 'ploy', 'lowly', 'laborer', 'fight', 'heads', 'other', 'schools', 'so', 'lowly', 'laborer', 'good', 'just', 'imagine', 'how', 'good', 'Master', 'Ti', 'several', 'excellent', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'incredibly', 'fun', 'watch', 'especially', 'when', 'Shing', 'fights', 'Lu', 'Ying', 'Willow', 'Sword', 'using', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'theme', 'background', 'music', 'cross-eyed', 'beggar', 'then', 'large', 'albeit', 'slow', 'man', 'woman', 'yes', 'Jackie', 'Drag', 'not', 'cute', '.Shing', 'then', 'huge', 'mistake', 'naming', 'facility', 'Sien', 'Yi', 'name', 'Now', 'rest', 'film', 'very', 'predictable', 'ultimate', 'showdown', 'Shing', 'Lung', 'Yen', 'Ting', 'Hua', 'way', 'handled', 'though', 'quite', 'sagacious', 'training', 'scenes', 'are', 'Jackie', 'masochistic', 'best', 'pulling', 'huge', 'sacks', 'doing', 'amazing', 'upside-down', 'sit-ups', 'new', 'trainer', 'Unicorn', 'having', 'sadistic', 'gleam', 'eyes', 'Shing', 'even', 'taught', 'Emotional', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Jackie', 'made', 'up', 'film', 'using', 'Joy', 'Anger', 'Sorrow', 'Happiness', 'focus', 'one', 'enemy', 'emotional', 'weak', 'spot.One', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'Dueling', 'Chopsticks', 'scene', 'Unicorn', 'prevents', 'Shing', 'eating', 'using', 'chopsticks', 'course', 'Unfortunately', 'influenced', 'be', 'quite', 'annoying', 'apply', 'whenever', 'applicable.I', 'would', 'not', 'rate', 'film', 'as', 'highly', 'Drunken', 'Master', 'are', 'problems', 'plot', 'too', 'much', 'Drunken', 'Master', 'However', 'feel', 'unheralded', 'martial', 'arts', 'piece', 'funny', 'exciting', 'excellent', 'ideas', 'stunt', 'choreography', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'also', 'must', 'see', 'want', 'watch', 'Jackie', 'drag']",N/A

The story is a fairly simple revenge fantasy with Chan being raised by his grandfather, who is more than capable of keeping his tricky grandson in line, until his grandfather is killed by the evil Unicorn and his roving band of killers.  Chan's grandfather's mentor takes up the mantle of teacher and trains the irrepressible Shing Ling (Chan) in the ways of ""emotional kung fu"" allowing him to stymie and have his ultimate revenge on unicorn.Chan will amaze in the ways of torturous training that he puts himself through on screen.  The fights are inventive and fun and the humor, lowbrow as it is, is at least comical and occasionally clever (watching how Chang handles newcomers challenging fighters at a kung fu school that he is being paid to represent is a new classic, especially when he fights in drag against an amorous opponent!).  The energy of the film is undeniable and when you realize that this is an early entry of Chan directing himself within the martial arts genre it just adds to the respect that film connoisseurs and martial arts lovers are bound to feel for him.The transfer is okay, not great, and looks like it was lifted from the old VHS source material.
