""Angie""","[1, 2]","Irregardless to the reproduction of the analog-to-digital technology, Charles Schulz and family have produced one of the best written cartoons in the lifespan of America.  I can count on my one hand the names of cartoonists whose work is embedded in my video/dvd/tape collection.My only gripe is not of the Schulz's library, but of the reproduction team who dispenses redigitized episodes on dvd with only two or three 24 minute shows on a disc!

The cartoons look as good if not better than they did when they first aired.Second, I feel quite lucky to have stumbled on this as it was my favorite Peanuts story as a kid. I used to own this in book form and always thought it was a fun story. There aren't many slow moments and, as someone else mentions, Charlie Brown finally gets to win one... even if the prize wasn't quite as spectacular as he might have hoped. The supporting characters are really at their best and most humorous. I LOVE the Marcie 'Howard Cosell' interview spoof and Linus's rant about the big kids always hogging the court.I agree with another reviewer that the Wizard of Oz opening was unexpected and can certainly trouble some kids. I was worried mine might freak out but lucked out- she was interested in who the four characters were. Other than that I think this is a great DVD to add to your children's or nostalgic adult's collection.",5,Outstanding remastering job,1313625600,"08 18, 2011",2011,1012,"['First', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'doing', 'incredible', 'job', 'remastering', 'cartoons', 'look', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'did', 'when', 'first', 'aired.Second', 'feel', 'quite', 'lucky', 'have', 'stumbled', 'was', 'favorite', 'Peanuts', 'story', 'kid', 'used', 'own', 'book', 'form', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'fun', 'story', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'slow', 'moments', 'someone', 'else', 'mentions', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'finally', 'win', 'one', 'even', 'prize', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'spectacular', 'might', 'have', 'hoped', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'best', 'most', 'humorous', 'LOVE', 'Marcie', ""'Howard"", 'Cosell', 'interview', 'spoof', 'Linus', 'rant', 'big', 'kids', 'always', 'hogging', 'court.I', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'opening', 'was', 'unexpected', 'can', 'certainly', 'trouble', 'kids', 'was', 'worried', 'mine', 'might', 'freak', 'out', 'lucked', 'out-', 'was', 'interested', 'who', 'four', 'characters', 'were', 'Other', 'think', 'great', 'DVD', 'add', 'children', 'nostalgic', 'adult', 'collection']","You're A Good Sport, Charlie Brown"

In terms of content, they lacked any of the complexity that makes some Peanuts shows so excellent.  The two cartoons on this disc may be better suited to younger kids, as the messages are positive and there isn't as much verbal abuse between the characters.  For the older kids (and adults), it's hard to beat 'Snoopy Come Home', 'It's Magic, Charlie Brown' (see the remastered deluxe edition of 'It's the Great Pumpkin'), or 'What a nightmare, Charlie Brown'.If only the shows on this disc were as good as the DVD production and special features.  Although I found the guest speaker views on Charlie Brown and the gang a little maudlin and kind of silly, I do appreciate that this edition came with special features.  'You're a Good Sport, Charlie Brown' gets an A for production, a C for story and entertainment value.

1199673,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B001HADFUY,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[6, 6]","YOU'RE A GOOD SPORT, CHARLIE BROWN was a Peanuts special that first aired on television in 1975.  Charles Schulz published original ""Peanuts"" strips for fifty years, from 1950-2000.  YOU'RE A GOOD SPORT, CHARLE BROWN aired in what is now the halfway point of the original strips publication.  It's not as well known as some of the other Peanuts specials that were broadcast, but is rather memorable because it features Charlie Brown winning at something instead of losing.The main plot follows Charlie, Snoopy (as the Masked Marvel), and Peppermint Patty as they compete in a motocross race (a sport that was fairly new at the time the special first aired).  Unlike Patty who has a new bike, or the Masked Marvel who has the best bike around at the time, Charlie Brown can only afford the cheapest bike the store sells.  There is no shine or gloss to his bike and it doesn't rev but puts.  Not only that, but Charlie Brown's bike is entered into the competition as #13, supposedly the unluckiest of all numbers. Still, Charlie Brown is a determined fellow and like the tortoise who beat the hair, sometimes slow and steady does when the race. Besides seeing what a good sport Charlie Brown, the special is also notable because of the make-shift pumpkin helmet Linus makes after Charlie is in an accident.  The motocross race is preceded by a scene with Snoopy playing tennis and followed by the Peanuts gang playing baseball. YOU'RE A GOOD SPORT, CHARLIE BROWN won an Emmy for Outstanding Children's Special.Also included on this the special, YOU'RE THE GREATEST, CHARLIE BROWN. In this special Charlie is recruited to represent his school by competing in the decathlon for the Junior Olympics.  Peppermint Patty trains Chuck in all ten events. Charlie Brown wins several events and has a chance to win the entire Junior Olympics for his school.  I remember seeing this scene on television several times when I was a kid. It was one of several specials that I particularly enjoyed because of the ironic ending. Both of the Peanuts specials on the disc have been remastered and cleaned up.  They look and sound spectacular.This DVD also includes the featurette, ""Dust Yourself Off & Pick Yourself Up, Charlie Brown"" which features Craig Schulz, one of Charles Schulz' sons, explaining how his teenage hobby served as the inspiration for YOU'RE A GOOD SPORT, CHARLIE BROWN.YOU'RE A GOOD SPORT, CHARLIE BROWN is a lesser known Peanuts special, but it's one that every Peanuts or Charlie Brown fan should have in their personal DVD library.",5,Charlie Brown Didn't Always Lose,1234224000,"02 10, 2009",2009,2536,"['YOU', 'GOOD', 'SPORT', 'CHARLIE', 'BROWN', 'was', 'Peanuts', 'special', 'first', 'aired', 'television', '1975', 'Charles', 'Schulz', 'published', 'original', 'Peanuts', 'strips', 'fifty', 'years', '1950-2000', 'YOU', 'GOOD', 'SPORT', 'CHARLE', 'BROWN', 'aired', 'what', 'now', 'halfway', 'point', 'original', 'strips', 'publication', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'known', 'other', 'Peanuts', 'specials', 'were', 'broadcast', 'rather', 'memorable', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'winning', 'something', 'instead', 'losing.The', 'main', 'plot', 'Charlie', 'Snoopy', 'Masked', 'Marvel', 'Peppermint', 'Patty', 'compete', 'motocross', 'race', 'sport', 'was', 'fairly', 'new', 'time', 'special', 'first', 'aired', 'Patty', 'who', 'new', 'bike', 'Masked', 'Marvel', 'who', 'best', 'bike', 'around', 'time', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'can', 'only', 'afford', 'cheapest', 'store', 'shine', 'gloss', 'bike', ""n't"", 'rev', 'puts', 'Not', 'only', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'bike', 'entered', 'competition', '13', 'supposedly', 'unluckiest', 'numbers', 'Still', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'determined', 'fellow', 'tortoise', 'who', 'beat', 'hair', 'sometimes', 'slow', 'steady', 'when', 'race', 'seeing', 'what', 'good', 'sport', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'special', 'also', 'notable', 'make-shift', 'pumpkin', 'helmet', 'Linus', 'Charlie', 'accident', 'motocross', 'race', 'preceded', 'scene', 'Snoopy', 'playing', 'tennis', 'followed', 'Peanuts', 'gang', 'playing', 'baseball', 'YOU', 'A', 'GOOD', 'SPORT', 'CHARLIE', 'BROWN', 'won', 'Emmy', 'Outstanding', 'Children', 'Special.Also', 'included', 'special', 'YOU', ""'RE"", 'THE', 'GREATEST', 'CHARLIE', 'BROWN', 'special', 'Charlie', 'recruited', 'represent', 'school', 'competing', 'decathlon', 'Junior', 'Olympics', 'Peppermint', 'Patty', 'Chuck', 'ten', 'events', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'several', 'events', 'chance', 'win', 'entire', 'Junior', 'Olympics', 'school', 'remember', 'seeing', 'scene', 'television', 'several', 'times', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'was', 'one', 'several', 'specials', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'ironic', 'ending', 'Peanuts', 'specials', 'disc', 'have', 'been', 'remastered', 'cleaned', 'up', 'look', 'sound', 'spectacular.This', 'DVD', 'also', 'featurette', 'Dust', 'Yourself', 'Off', 'Pick', 'Yourself', 'Up', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Craig', 'Schulz', 'one', 'Charles', 'Schulz', 'sons', 'explaining', 'how', 'teenage', 'hobby', 'served', 'inspiration', 'YOU', ""'RE"", 'GOOD', 'SPORT', 'CHARLIE', 'BROWN.YOU', 'GOOD', 'SPORT', 'CHARLIE', 'BROWN', 'lesser', 'known', 'Peanuts', 'special', 'one', 'Peanuts', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'fan', 'should', 'have', 'personal', 'DVD', 'library']","You're A Good Sport, Charlie Brown"
