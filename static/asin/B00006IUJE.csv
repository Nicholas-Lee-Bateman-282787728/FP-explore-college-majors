I love Simon Kirke (I'm a huge fan of Free and early Bad Co.) from a previous All-Starr lineup, but you have to admit, Sheila E. is a better drummer overall. The comraderie and genuine affection this latest lineup has for each other and for Ringo are awesome. Ringo doesn't look tired, by the way, as some review claimed below. He always looks like that when he plays the drums, be it in 1964 on TV, in the ""Let It Be"" movie or the promo videos and concert footage we've seen after The Beatles.I'm a bassist, and Ringo's 2003 lineup on this DVD is far from shabby. Most bands would love to have this kind of ""first night,"" which is the band's first show as seen on the DVD. I can't believe people nitpick about Collin's solos and stuff. Collin's a fine guitarist, and a great singer and writer, by the way.",4,What's up with the negative reviews?,1106179200,"01 20, 2005",2005,1039,"['Hey', 'guys', 'yes', 'John', 'Waite', 'John', 'Entwistle', 'bass', 'Collin', 'Haye', 'Joe', 'Walsh', 'lead', 'guitar', 'what', '2003', 'lineup', 'did', 'have', 'over', 'previous', 'lineups', 'fact', 'best', 'vocal', 'lineup', 'Ringo', 'had', 'yet', 'love', 'Simon', 'Kirke', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Free', 'early', 'Bad', 'Co.', 'previous', 'All-Starr', 'lineup', 'have', 'admit', 'Sheila', 'E.', 'better', 'drummer', 'overall', 'comraderie', 'genuine', 'affection', 'latest', 'lineup', 'other', 'Ringo', 'are', 'awesome', 'Ringo', ""n't"", 'look', 'tired', 'way', 'review', 'claimed', 'always', 'when', 'drums', 'be', '1964', 'TV', 'Let', 'Be', 'movie', 'promo', 'videos', 'concert', 'footage', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Beatles.I', ""'m"", 'bassist', 'Ringo', '2003', 'lineup', 'DVD', 'far', 'shabby', 'Most', 'bands', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'kind', 'first', 'night', 'band', 'first', 'show', 'seen', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'people', 'nitpick', 'Collin', 'solos', 'stuff', 'Collin', 'fine', 'guitarist', 'great', 'singer', 'writer', 'way']",N/A
717312,A31KXTOQNTWUVM,B00006IUJE,Bill Board,"[1, 1]","2001: I was married to a lovely woman seventeen years younger than me.  She had noticed from the time we started dating about a year before, that I'd just as soon listen to some good music than eat.  Plus, she heard my guitar player/best friend and me incessantly discussing Ian Hunter.  So you have no idea how orgasmically excited I was to see that the 2001 All Starr edition included Mr. Hunter -especially since he himself was going out on the road later on that year with that brat from JC Mellonhead's band, having the temetity to stand where the irreplaceable Mick Ronson had once stood.  And these All Starrs - wow, guitarist Roger Hodgson who was responsible for, really, every Supertramp song you were ever familiar with, and then, on bass, Greg Lake who'd been an integral part of the first incarnation of King Crimson, and then one-third of Emerson Lake & Palmer.  The keyboard player, Howard Jones' solo material, left a lot to be desired, but he was more than talented in replicating the keyboard parts of his predessors.  My only gripe was - yuck - someone it seems everyone else flaunts their testosterone in championing, drummer Sheila ""E.""  One of the totally unnecessary ""Prince's"" progeny, who, it seemed, were all incapable of spelling their own last names.  Regardless: Ringo's the ULTIMATE showman, and he will incorporate musicians from every era (well... maybe not Chuck Berry or Jerry Lee Lewis) and the band will sound like they've been performing together since Elvis left that Heartbreak Hotel.  Thank you Ringo for a great show, and especially for allowing me to introduce my wife to Ian Hunter in a band that was as prolific as he.  Say... WHEN are you going to put your 1997 All Starr incarnation with Peter Frampton, Jack Bruce, Gary Brooker, & Simon Kirke on DVD.  I've just about worn out my VHS.OK, awhile later - SECOND REQUEST:  When are you, Ringo, or Fishof (whoever he is), or that entity known as ""MPL"" going to release a DVD of the 1997 tour with, Frampton, Bruce, Brooker, & Kirke?  Be serious, guys - WHY do you continue to release stuff with the dork from ""Men At War...uh, Work,"" David Lee's man Bissionette, that ""Dream Weaver"" guy, or even RE-releasing Todd Rundgren, when I KNOW people (me for one) have been BEGGING you since 2001 to cut that 1997 music loose?  Do you listen to fans or do you just have some ""New World Order""?elitist attitude like ""be grateful you're even getting this?""",5,"Thank You, Ringo",1379030400,"09 13, 2013",2013,2439,"['2001', 'was', 'married', 'lovely', 'woman', 'seventeen', 'years', 'younger', 'had', 'noticed', 'time', 'started', 'dating', 'year', 'before', ""'d"", 'just', 'as', 'soon', 'listen', 'good', 'music', 'eat', 'heard', 'guitar', 'player/best', 'friend', 'incessantly', 'discussing', 'Ian', 'Hunter', 'So', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'orgasmically', 'excited', 'was', 'see', '2001', 'All', 'Starr', 'edition', 'included', 'Mr.', 'Hunter', '-especially', 'was', 'going', 'out', 'road', 'later', 'year', 'brat', 'JC', 'Mellonhead', 'band', 'having', 'temetity', 'stand', 'where', 'irreplaceable', 'Mick', 'Ronson', 'had', 'once', 'stood', 'All', 'Starrs', 'wow', 'guitarist', 'Roger', 'Hodgson', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'really', 'Supertramp', 'song', 'were', 'ever', 'familiar', 'then', 'bass', 'Greg', 'Lake', 'who', ""'d"", 'been', 'integral', 'part', 'first', 'incarnation', 'King', 'Crimson', 'then', 'one-third', 'Emerson', 'Lake', 'Palmer', 'keyboard', 'player', 'Howard', 'Jones', 'solo', 'material', 'left', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'was', 'more', 'talented', 'replicating', 'keyboard', 'parts', 'predessors', 'only', 'gripe', 'was', 'yuck', 'someone', 'everyone', 'else', 'testosterone', 'championing', 'drummer', 'Sheila', 'E.', 'One', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'Prince', 'progeny', 'who', 'seemed', 'were', 'incapable', 'spelling', 'own', 'last', 'names', 'Regardless', 'Ringo', 'ULTIMATE', 'showman', 'will', 'incorporate', 'musicians', 'era', 'well', 'maybe', 'not', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lewis', 'band', 'will', 'sound', ""'ve"", 'been', 'performing', 'together', 'Elvis', 'left', 'Heartbreak', 'Hotel', 'Thank', 'Ringo', 'great', 'show', 'especially', 'allowing', 'introduce', 'wife', 'Ian', 'Hunter', 'band', 'was', 'as', 'prolific', 'Say', 'are', 'going', 'put', '1997', 'Starr', 'incarnation', 'Peter', 'Frampton', 'Jack', 'Bruce', 'Gary', 'Brooker', 'Simon', 'Kirke', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'just', 'worn', 'out', 'VHS.OK', 'awhile', 'later', 'SECOND', 'REQUEST', 'When', 'are', 'Ringo', 'Fishof', 'entity', 'known', 'MPL', 'going', 'release', 'DVD', '1997', 'tour', 'Frampton', 'Bruce', 'Brooker', 'Kirke', 'Be', 'serious', 'guys', 'WHY', 'do', 'continue', 'release', 'stuff', 'dork', 'Men', 'War', 'uh', 'Work', 'David', 'Lee', 'man', 'Bissionette', 'Dream', 'Weaver', 'guy', 'even', 'RE-releasing', 'Todd', 'Rundgren', 'when', 'KNOW', 'people', 'one', 'have', 'been', 'BEGGING', '2001', 'cut', '1997', 'music', 'loose', 'Do', 'listen', 'fans', 'do', 'just', 'have', 'New', 'World', 'Order', 'elitist', 'attitude', 'be', 'grateful', ""'re"", 'even', 'getting']",N/A

They must not embrace the Beatles or Ringo, because if you do, you will love this concert. Ringo's voice has matured like fine wine and he sounds better than he did in 1967 and is a more polished and mature performer. He plays all of his songs from the Beatles years and does beautiful versions of It Don't Come Easy, Photograph, You're Sixteen and all his other 70's vintage hits. The way he introduces each song is charming, funny and droll, just the way we've come to expect Ringo.The only slight criticism is that Ringo doesn't drum much, as in all his All-Starr concerts, he stands up front and sings without a drum kit in front of him.

It is a chance to see Greg Lake, Howard Jones, Sheila E., Ian Hunter, Roger H. from Supertramp and the others on the same stage. With all these great musicians, the live performance is incredible. Songs like ""lucky man"", ""take a long way home"", ""logical song"", ""give a little bit"", ""no one is to blame"".I have two complains. First, there are no good extras on the DVD, just the concert and a 8-minute featurette. Next, the setlist is incomplete. At least, all hit-songs are there, but there are at least 2-4 songs missing, like the good ""In the court of the Crimson King"" by Greg Lake.

717316,A3NUA12GI8OFU1,B00006IUJE,Colin Klein,"[13, 13]","This disc would have gotten five stars, had the whole wonderful show been included and put in the correct order. This was a fantastic tour, why in the world would they cut half of it out and put it in a blender? If there ever consistently is an over 2 hour show that just flies by, it's an All-Starr Band show. Every one of them has been great fun to see and hear, and this show was one of the best. The biggest omissions from my view are the rest of Greg Lake's songs, and not showing the dueling drum solos between Sheila and Ringo. Ringo NEVER did drum solos, but Sheila brought it out on this tour--how could anyone cut that out? Ringo's drumming was inspired more than it has been in decades on this tour (prodded by Sheila I think) it's a shame so much of it was left on the cutting room floor...The other small complaint I have with this is the rear 5.1 sound mix has too much echo and delay to be mixed as loud as it is. On some of the songs that became a distraction, which is something you should never be noticing at all. It may not bother any of you, and is still a more exciting listen than the stereo mix.Don't think twice about buying this disc though, what is here is very enjoyable. If it sells enough, who knows, maybe we can get all the old shows put out--complete please--on DVD too. That other All-Starr Best of DVD is a nice preview to what is sitting in the vaults somewhere. The complete All-Starr Gary Brooker version was out on VHS, why not DVD? How about it, you studio business types out there, start giving the people what they want on DVD! And stop cutting up great shows! Anyone that wants to buy a concert video, wants the whole show, its as simple as that. Why is it such a foreign concept to these companies?

717318,A3DWLI9VIYXI16,B00006IUJE,Jesse Ross,"[1, 1]","There are some good performances here, but not many.  Sheila E is definitely a highlight.  In all, however, the songs sound thin and powerless.  The band appears to just be going through the motions, with very little life or energy.  Even Ringo doesn't seem to be enjoying himself as much as usual.  Others have mentioned that this concert took place early on in the tour.  Some of the lifelessness might be easily dismissed if that's the case -- perhaps the performers are not yet completely comfortable with each other's songs.  All the Ringo numbers are pretty standard by this point.  Presented here is the ten thousandth version of ""Yellow Submarine,"" the ten thousandth version of ""It Don't Come Easy,"" etc.  The All-Starr lineup is okay; with the exception of Sheila E each member was in the band for the first time.  That at least brought somewhat of a freshness to the set list.So if the concert itself was mediocre, I'm sad to say that the DVD production isn't much better.  The volume is way too low (at least on my set), and the concert cuts to backstage footage or to interviews after every song.  I somehow wonder if Ringo has started taking DVD producing lessons from Paul!  (This DVD came just a year or two after Paul's hack job on ""Back in the US."")  And unlike the 2006 DVD, the extra footage here is virtually useless.This is a bad DVD.  For Ringo fans, I recommend the 2006 tour DVD over this one easily.
