So you should know when I say this is crap it is crap compared to movies that are suppose to be bad.  This movie is awful.  I would tell you the plot but there really isn't one.  Cheerleaders bus crashes in some backwoods town and the coroner who also happens to be the sheriff wants to harvest and sell what he can. there is a perv who wants to have sex with bodies, a formula that brings them back to life.  many factors make this movie bad the major is the acting or lack there of.  I wouldn't recommend buying it unless you just like to watch really bad movies.  I gave it a two because it will entertain those curious about bad movies.",2,crap crap crap,1363478400,"03 17, 2013",2013,808,"['one', 'who', 'read', 'movie', 'judge', 'movies', 'similar', 'movies', 'i.e', 'blockbuster', 'sci', 'fi', 'blockbuster', 'sci', 'fi', 'b-movies', 'vs', 'b-movies', 'should', 'know', 'when', 'say', 'crap', 'crap', 'compared', 'movies', 'are', 'suppose', 'be', 'bad', 'movie', 'awful', 'would', 'tell', 'plot', 'really', ""n't"", 'one', 'Cheerleaders', 'bus', 'crashes', 'backwoods', 'town', 'coroner', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'sheriff', 'harvest', 'sell', 'what', 'can', 'perv', 'who', 'have', 'sex', 'bodies', 'formula', 'back', 'life', 'many', 'factors', 'make', 'movie', 'bad', 'major', 'acting', 'lack', 'there', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'buying', 'just', 'watch', 'really', 'bad', 'movies', 'gave', 'two', 'will', 'entertain', 'curious', 'bad', 'movies']",N/A

This movie is horrible and do not listen to any of the good reviews. This is a campy movie but the hype is completely misleading. For those of you who are looking for nudity and lots of it, don't waste your money. There is one scene of real nudity, the rest is of sex dolls and horribly portrayed. You can see how fake the whole thing is and there is nothing redeeming about this movie at all. If I could get my money back I would, but at least I can save anyone else from spending money on something that should have never been made.",1,don't believe the high rated reviews one bit,1344211200,"08 6, 2012",2012,676,"['can', 'not', 'believe', 'amazon', 'would', 'allow', 'such', 'horrible', 'movies', 'be', 'sold', 'site', 'especially', 'completely', 'falsely', 'advertised', 'movie', 'horrible', 'do', 'not', 'listen', 'good', 'reviews', 'campy', 'movie', 'hype', 'completely', 'misleading', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'nudity', 'lots', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'one', 'scene', 'real', 'nudity', 'rest', 'sex', 'dolls', 'horribly', 'portrayed', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'fake', 'whole', 'thing', 'nothing', 'redeeming', 'movie', 'could', 'get', 'money', 'back', 'would', 'least', 'can', 'save', 'anyone', 'else', 'spending', 'money', 'something', 'should', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'made']",N/A

Sarjoo ""VicSarjoo""","[6, 9]","A superbly executed screen adaptation of 'Lolita' by Nabokov's, 'Cheerleader Autopsy' borrows heavily from early Fellini and late Kubrick.  However, master auteur director Stu Dodge manages to avoid the shortcomings of his mentors while flawlessly combining their greatest strengths.Most impacting is Dodge's ability to bring his cast into a fully-realized method-acting rendition of Nabokov's vision.  Stark, visceral, exhilarating and, at times, uncomfortable to watch, the cast's performance is brutal in honesty yet feather-subtle in its humility and grace.The role of archetypes in the collective unconscious are vigorously explored in this film, a clear homage to Fellini's Italian neorealism period of the 1950's.  In fact, one can assert and support that 'Autopsy' is the most elegant and well thought out exploration of romance between declining elderly characters and robust young -- and Jungian -- examples of budding youth.This film is an absolute must for those who enjoyed 'The Graduate' and 'Harold and Maude' as well as passionate fans of Fellini and Kubrick.",5,FELLINI MEETS KUBRICK IN THIS MASTERFUL SCREEN ADAPTATION OF LOLITA,1204848000,"03 7, 2008",2008,1075,"['superbly', 'executed', 'screen', 'adaptation', ""'Lolita"", 'Nabokov', ""'Cheerleader"", 'Autopsy', 'borrows', 'heavily', 'early', 'Fellini', 'late', 'Kubrick', 'However', 'master', 'auteur', 'director', 'Stu', 'Dodge', 'avoid', 'shortcomings', 'mentors', 'flawlessly', 'combining', 'greatest', 'strengths.Most', 'impacting', 'Dodge', 'ability', 'bring', 'cast', 'fully-realized', 'method-acting', 'rendition', 'Nabokov', 'vision', 'Stark', 'visceral', 'exhilarating', 'times', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'cast', 'performance', 'brutal', 'honesty', 'yet', 'feather-subtle', 'humility', 'grace.The', 'role', 'archetypes', 'collective', 'unconscious', 'are', 'vigorously', 'explored', 'film', 'clear', 'homage', 'Fellini', 'Italian', 'neorealism', 'period', '1950', 'fact', 'one', 'can', 'assert', 'support', ""'Autopsy"", 'most', 'elegant', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'exploration', 'romance', 'declining', 'elderly', 'characters', 'robust', 'young', 'Jungian', 'examples', 'budding', 'youth.This', 'film', 'absolute', 'must', 'who', 'enjoyed', ""'The"", 'Graduate', ""'Harold"", 'Maude', 'as', 'well', 'passionate', 'fans', 'Fellini', 'Kubrick']",N/A
