I thought this was going to be a movie, like Dora's Christmas Adventure, but it is episodes, not a movie. Of course my kids like it and will watch it, but for car rides movies are better and easier!!!",4,This is not a movie,1348444800,"09 24, 2012",2012,376,"['have', 'same', 'complaint', 'Dora', 'did', 'Dora', 'Gymnastics', 'Adventures', 'need', 'give', 'MORE', 'DETAIL', 'product', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'buying', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'movie', 'Dora', 'Christmas', 'Adventure', 'episodes', 'not', 'movie', 'course', 'kids', 'will', 'watch', 'car', 'rides', 'movies', 'are', 'better', 'easier']",Dora's Ballet Adventures

Dora episodes tend to be dumb, brainless, un-educational, and unfortunately, highly addictive for kids.  Our kids never learned anything from watching Dora.  And they spent probably a hundred hours or more watching it.  They don't even learn Spanish.  Get a real educational product if you want your kids to learn something.

Now that I have a toddler daughter and a newborn girl it only makes sense to have an introduction to Dora in our house probably to be watched over and over again. I have to admit that her voice is not exactly fun to listen to, but an energetic character is okay every so often. Also the pausing for replies from the watcher is a bit offsetting at first and does not quite capture my toddler's attention, but there are majy more years where I believe she will be quite interactive with it.",3,Neat introduction to Dora for us,1313712000,"08 19, 2011",2011,563,"['years', 'have', 'seen', 'bits', 'pieces', 'never', 'really', 'watched', 'Dora', 'Now', 'have', 'toddler', 'daughter', 'newborn', 'girl', 'only', 'sense', 'have', 'introduction', 'Dora', 'house', 'probably', 'be', 'watched', 'over', 'again', 'have', 'admit', 'voice', 'not', 'exactly', 'listen', 'energetic', 'character', 'okay', 'so', 'often', 'Also', 'pausing', 'replies', 'watcher', 'bit', 'offsetting', 'first', 'not', 'quite', 'capture', 'toddler', 'attention', 'are', 'majy', 'more', 'years', 'where', 'believe', 'will', 'be', 'quite', 'interactive']",Dora's Ballet Adventures

1436634,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B0051GSZQ4,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[14, 15]","This DVD contains four episodes of Dora the Explorer. All four have a musical theme and are totally adorable. The stories are interactive. Children are encouraged to repeat words or hop like a bunny. It really gets kids active as they sing, dance and playfully imitate animals. Throughout the stories little bits of Spanish are also taught. Like in one story you learn to sing happy birthday in Spanish.In the first story Dora has to go back to the dance school to get ballet shoes for the performers. She has the help of a map and her friend Boots the monkey. During the story children learn to count and learn traditional songs.In the second story there are also well-known songs children can sing along with. There is a fun piano bridge, a singing gate and a music box. The adventure includes Dora gathering together all the animals to play instruments so they can magically open a music box in which the town's musical instruments have been hidden. Children learn the names of all the musical instruments.In the third story things get a little silly. There is an invitation to a fiesta where a red rooster has lost his cake. Again there is a singing gate and a bridge. There is a cute section where animals make a sound of a different animal and children have to make the correct sound. The songs in this story are also sung the wrong way one time and then the right version is sung. There is a fun grumpy troll and you have to make silly faces to get him to laugh. There is also a section where children learn to count in Spanish. At the end praise is given for helping with the story and children get a sense of accomplishment.The fourth and last story involves Dora and Boots the monkey getting to a birthday party. They must go up a long flight of stairs, over a bridge and along a path leading to Dora's house where a surprise birthday party takes place. I will tell you this. If you let your child watch this story you might want to have some banana cake on hand. I will tell you that I got really hungry for some. lol My mother used to buy Sara Lee banana cake so that might be an option and will save time. During the story children solve a riddle and count party hats.The four stories are cute, encourage children to be physically active and are very educational while still being entertaining. I liked that all four stories were musical adventures. You may want to buy a flute, some small drums or a harmonica so your children can play along.~The Rebecca Review",5,Educational and Interactive Musical Adventures,1313884800,"08 21, 2011",2011,2475,"['DVD', 'four', 'episodes', 'Dora', 'Explorer', 'four', 'have', 'musical', 'theme', 'are', 'totally', 'adorable', 'stories', 'are', 'interactive', 'Children', 'are', 'encouraged', 'repeat', 'words', 'hop', 'bunny', 'really', 'kids', 'active', 'sing', 'dance', 'playfully', 'imitate', 'animals', 'stories', 'little', 'bits', 'Spanish', 'are', 'also', 'taught', 'one', 'story', 'learn', 'sing', 'happy', 'birthday', 'Spanish.In', 'first', 'story', 'Dora', 'go', 'back', 'dance', 'school', 'get', 'ballet', 'shoes', 'performers', 'help', 'map', 'friend', 'Boots', 'monkey', 'story', 'children', 'learn', 'count', 'learn', 'traditional', 'songs.In', 'second', 'story', 'are', 'also', 'well-known', 'songs', 'children', 'can', 'sing', 'along', 'fun', 'piano', 'bridge', 'singing', 'gate', 'music', 'box', 'adventure', 'Dora', 'gathering', 'together', 'animals', 'play', 'instruments', 'can', 'magically', 'open', 'music', 'box', 'town', 'musical', 'instruments', 'have', 'been', 'hidden', 'Children', 'learn', 'names', 'musical', 'instruments.In', 'third', 'story', 'things', 'get', 'little', 'silly', 'invitation', 'fiesta', 'where', 'red', 'rooster', 'lost', 'cake', 'Again', 'singing', 'gate', 'bridge', 'cute', 'section', 'where', 'animals', 'make', 'sound', 'different', 'animal', 'children', 'have', 'make', 'correct', 'sound', 'songs', 'story', 'are', 'also', 'sung', 'wrong', 'way', 'one', 'time', 'then', 'right', 'version', 'sung', 'fun', 'grumpy', 'troll', 'have', 'make', 'silly', 'get', 'laugh', 'also', 'section', 'where', 'children', 'learn', 'count', 'Spanish', 'end', 'praise', 'given', 'helping', 'story', 'children', 'get', 'sense', 'accomplishment.The', 'fourth', 'last', 'story', 'Dora', 'Boots', 'monkey', 'getting', 'birthday', 'party', 'must', 'go', 'up', 'long', 'flight', 'stairs', 'bridge', 'path', 'leading', 'Dora', 'house', 'where', 'surprise', 'birthday', 'party', 'place', 'will', 'tell', 'let', 'child', 'watch', 'story', 'might', 'want', 'have', 'banana', 'cake', 'hand', 'will', 'tell', 'got', 'really', 'hungry', 'lol', 'mother', 'used', 'buy', 'Sara', 'Lee', 'banana', 'cake', 'so', 'might', 'be', 'option', 'will', 'save', 'time', 'story', 'children', 'solve', 'riddle', 'count', 'party', 'hats.The', 'four', 'stories', 'are', 'cute', 'encourage', 'children', 'be', 'physically', 'active', 'are', 'very', 'educational', 'while', 'still', 'being', 'entertaining', 'liked', 'four', 'stories', 'were', 'musical', 'adventures', 'may', 'want', 'buy', 'flute', 'small', 'drums', 'harmonica', 'so', 'children', 'can', 'play', 'along.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",Dora's Ballet Adventures
