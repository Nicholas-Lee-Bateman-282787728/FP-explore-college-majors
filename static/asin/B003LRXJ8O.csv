This story is about a dysfunctional family and the youngest daughter wants to go to college and become a professional dancer. She is gifted, but her two sisters try to discourage her at all ends, and drag her to their level of nothingness. She is encouraged by her mentor friend to go to college.",5,Black Girl,1399852800,"05 12, 2014",2014,324,"['movie', 'friend', 'story', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'go', 'college', 'become', 'professional', 'dancer', 'gifted', 'two', 'sisters', 'try', 'discourage', 'ends', 'level', 'nothingness', 'encouraged', 'mentor', 'friend', 'go', 'college']",Black Girl...

In a lot of families black, white, and etc the momma made the daughter marry or move out of the house when she gets pregnant or quit school.

I remembered seeing a interview on the Tavis Smiley show with Ruby Dee and I decided to write him to ask her if this movie will be released on DVD since her husband (now deceased) Ossie Davis directed the movie. I got a response saying that the request ""didn't fall on deaf ears"" so I just chucked it up as a general response. But before I knew it, Black Girl was released on DVD. I think the acting is great especially from Billie Jean's sisters. This movie fell under the radar but needs to be a part of the other great 70's movies. It's short, but it is so culturally authentic.",5,"Black Girl, where do you think you're going to...",1343174400,"07 25, 2012",2012,667,"['remember', 'seeing', 'movie', 'late', 'night', 'cable', 'looked', 'everywhere', 'find', 'remembered', 'seeing', 'interview', 'Tavis', 'Smiley', 'show', 'Ruby', 'Dee', 'decided', 'write', 'ask', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'husband', 'now', 'deceased', 'Ossie', 'Davis', 'directed', 'movie', 'got', 'response', 'saying', 'request', 'did', ""n't"", 'fall', 'deaf', 'ears', 'so', 'just', 'chucked', 'up', 'general', 'response', 'knew', 'Black', 'Girl', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'think', 'acting', 'great', 'especially', 'Billie', 'Jean', 'sisters', 'movie', 'fell', 'radar', 'be', 'part', 'other', 'great', '70', 'movies', 'short', 'so', 'culturally', 'authentic']",Black Girl...

I did not see the beginning of it, so when I saw that it was available to purchase I quickly ordered it. The movie was made in 1972 and the clothing,cars,and hairstyles reflect that era. the main theme in the movie is you should never give up on your dreams and you can overcome obstacles put in your path. the movei starred Brock Peters, Leslie Uggams, Claudia McNeil( you may remember here from the original Raisin in the Sun), Paula Petitt who gives an amazing performance as Billie Jean. There was also a cameo appearance by Ruby Dee. This movie is worth watching. The only issue I had with this movie is the picture quality was okay, but then again the movie was made in 1972.",4,Good movie,1315785600,"09 12, 2011",2011,746,"['began', 'watching', 'movie', 'television', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'beginning', 'when', 'saw', 'was', 'available', 'purchase', 'quickly', 'ordered', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1972', 'clothing', 'cars', 'hairstyles', 'reflect', 'era', 'main', 'theme', 'movie', 'should', 'never', 'give', 'up', 'dreams', 'can', 'overcome', 'obstacles', 'put', 'path', 'movei', 'starred', 'Brock', 'Peters', 'Leslie', 'Uggams', 'Claudia', 'McNeil', 'may', 'remember', 'here', 'original', 'Raisin', 'Sun', 'Paula', 'Petitt', 'who', 'amazing', 'performance', 'Billie', 'Jean', 'was', 'also', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Ruby', 'Dee', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'only', 'issue', 'had', 'movie', 'picture', 'quality', 'was', 'okay', 'then', 'again', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1972']",Black Girl...
