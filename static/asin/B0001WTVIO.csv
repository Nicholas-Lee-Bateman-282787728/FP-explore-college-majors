815073,A3TJJHMWV3SFNI,B0001WTVIO,"Brett Heitkam ""DVD obsessed""","[9, 9]","My Mother the Spy is a highly entertaining TV-Movie from 2000 that is very well done.Jayne Brook (Chicago Hope) plays Alison Shaeffer, a book editor who has always wondered why her mother Gloria (Dyan Cannon of Ally McBeal) has never ""been there for her"" growing up.  Well, it turns out Gloria is a CIA agent who hides her job from her daughter to protect her from it.  Alison's grandmother (Gloria Stuart of Titanic fame) is always there to make excuses for her daughter's unexpected trips across the world.  Finally one day, after Gloria and Alison plan a vacation to the Bahamas together that doesn't pan out, Alison gets tangled up in a web of mystery and ends up finding out her mother's secret and teaming up with her to stop a wealthy criminal mastermind from selling anthrax to the highest bidder.  Lots of excitement ensues: cat and mouse chases, gunfights, kidnappings, and more.  Alison is a fish out of water with all these adventures and her witty remarks about situations always keep a smile on your face while you are on the edge of your seat.The DVD of My Mother the Spy features the original full-screen presentation of the movie and no special features except scene selection.

815075,A2VJ80PM1G00QV,B0001WTVIO,drkhimxz,"[0, 0]","This was clearly made to be fun and nothing more. It IS light and funny. It has a beautiful young woman and a familiar (and still good looking) older woman playing her mother. Gloria Stuart,  well-known to anyone who has seen films of the 30's, appears as the grandmother. Her role is brief but I enjoyed the presence of someone who was around when movies were still learning to talk.... even if she was never a Star.The story involves CIA agents and sellers of germ warfare chemicals. Not in the same league as Hamlet or Othello, the plot works adequately to give the ladies a chance to show themselves to advantage while kicking around the Bad Guys. The Good Guys, like the Bad Guys, are there only as foils for the Gals.If you are in the mood for a nice, no social significance, movie to brighten up 90 minutes, this should do the trick.",4,Amusing TV Comedy Movie,1356307200,"12 24, 2012",2012,840,"['was', 'clearly', 'made', 'be', 'fun', 'nothing', 'more', 'light', 'funny', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'familiar', 'still', 'good', 'looking', 'older', 'woman', 'playing', 'mother', 'Gloria', 'Stuart', 'well-known', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'films', '30', 'grandmother', 'role', 'brief', 'enjoyed', 'presence', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'around', 'when', 'movies', 'were', 'still', 'learning', 'talk', 'even', 'was', 'never', 'Star.The', 'story', 'CIA', 'agents', 'sellers', 'germ', 'warfare', 'chemicals', 'Not', 'same', 'league', 'Hamlet', 'Othello', 'plot', 'adequately', 'give', 'ladies', 'chance', 'show', 'advantage', 'kicking', 'Bad', 'Guys', 'Good', 'Guys', 'Bad', 'Guys', 'are', 'there', 'only', 'foils', 'Gals.If', 'are', 'mood', 'nice', 'social', 'significance', 'movie', 'brighten', 'up', '90', 'minutes', 'should', 'do', 'trick']",My Mother the Spy

815077,A3GTF3Q8KJ265C,B0001WTVIO,K. Williams,"[1, 1]","Always missing important events in her child's life leaves Gloria Shaeffer (Dyan Cannon, former wife of Cary Grant) estranged from her daughter Alison Shaeffer (Jayne Brook). Despite the befuddled appearance, Gloria is actuality, as the movie title reveals, a spy. As a gift, Grandma (Gloria Stuart: Old Rose in Titanic) instigates a Bahama vacation for mother and daughter. Cancellation causes Alison to search out her mother in the middle of an undercover assignment. Alison accidently compromises her mother's cover, causing Gloria to be kidnapped. After agent Gary Sutton (Kevin Kilner) breaks the news to Alison, she attempts a rescue by allowing herself also to be captured.Mother and daughter constantly exchange well-timed quips. In fact, everyone in company with Alison becomes a situation comedy. Her boyfriend Peter (Garwin Sanford), wants to ask Alison something that will 'forever change their future.' When villain Gustavo Vasquez (David Palffy) becomes attracted to Alison, she feigns reciprocal adoration in a protracted ruse while waiting for his drugged drink to take effect. Alison appears to go beyond the call of duty while her shocked mother looks on through a window.Because this is a made-for-television movie, resolution is not as sharp as one would expect from a DVD. Packaging is minimal and there are no extras. Nevertheless, the humorous intrigue is quite entertaining. I've paid much more for far less entertainment. What a bargain!Movie quote: Gloria: ""Did you wear that to the meeting?"" Alison: ""Yea."" Gloria: ""Your hair looks nice.""",5,Deceptively funny!
