I liked everyone in this move they were all great but I think I liked Christine Taylor the most and even though exaggerated she really got Marcia who could be conceited and snobby at times quite accurately, I also think Gary Cole was perfect as Mike with his long lectures and speeches and finger wagging and Shelley Long and Jennifer Elise Cox were both good as Carol and Jan and though it's a very funny movie I slightly prefer the sequel which was just a little bit sillier but I just loved that whole tripping with the Brady's scene!

377957,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6303494080,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Growing up `The Brady Bunch' was a staple in my house.  Sure it was all reruns but they were good reruns!  I had never seen `The Brady Bunch Movie' though until just last week when my wife suggested we watch it.  She knew how much I loved the show and was astonished that I had never seen the movie.  Preparing myself for a letdown I sat before the television and waited.  I waited for that said letdown for about 80 minutes but it never came.  In fact I'm tempted to say that there is absolutely nothing director Betty Thomas could have done to improve upon this comedy.  The cast was perfect (don't get me started on the uncanny Christine Taylor/Maureen McCormack resemblance), the script was ideal and the setting couldn't have been better.  Taking the Brady household into the 90's was one thing, but the way they did it was even better.  The film is shot like an episode of `The Brady Bunch' and the set pieces are downright identical (even down to the Astroturf which is commented on by their neighbors...Hilarious!).The plot for this parody has the Brady's trying to raise enough money to save their home.  Their neighbor, the greedy Mr. Dittmeyer, has convinced the entire community to sell their homes but if he can't get the Brady's to sell then his business deal will fall through and he won't make the boat loads of money he's counting on.  Because of some back taxes the Brady's actually stand a chance at losing their home for good and with Mr. Dittmeyer trying his hardest to stifle any chance of success in raising the money the Brady's are having the hardest time working things out.The kids have their own problems though.  Greg is trying to woo a girl at school but his brand of pursuit just doesn't mesh well with the 90's world he's oblivious to.  Peter is also having some girl problems, mainly because the girl that he likes and that actually likes him is currently dating the Dittmeyer's rebellious son Eric.  Marcia is trying to decide who to go to the dance with, the sweet guy who asked her first or the sex-hungry jock who asked her last.  Jan, still living in Marcia's shadow, struggles with finding her own identity and standing apart from her scene stealing sister.  The two younger children, Bobby and Cindy, are kinda just there to be there but Cindy does have this hilarious lisp that Mr. Dittmeyer can't understand, and that serves up some laughs.  Cindy is also struggling with her incessant tattling, so when she overhears the financial troubles her parents are in she debates whether or not she should tell anyone.What's also wonderful about this film is that is rehashes some of the greatest moments in Brady Bunch history, like the football to the face and the wig Jan donned in the show (except here her wig is a little more eccentric).  This film also delves into the insanity behind Jan's inner rage against her sister which is represented by voices in her head.  The actors all do a wonderful job in getting down pat the mannerisms of the original cast which helps make everything feel authentic.  Shelly Long and Gary Cole are spot on as Carol and Mike Brady, and all the kids are great, especially the girls.  Christine Taylor, Jennifer Elise Cox and Olivia Hack are superb here.  Another standout is Jean Smart who plays Mrs. Dittmeyer, a drunk who hates her husband and lusts after Mike Brady, and it turns out his sons as well.  Michael McKean is hilarious as Mr. Dittmeyer, but he's upstaged in almost every scene by Hack's Cindy.So in the end `The Brady Bunch Movie' is top notch hilarity that does the amazing show total justice.  I have yet to see `The Very Brady Sequel' but I'll be sure to check it out.

The Brady's still have their 70's lifestyle going on. Hair, clothes, slang, you name it. But it is present day. The 90's. We see the two different cultures collide in a hysterical way. Shelley Long is perfect as Carol Brady. She is absolutely flawless. Gary Cole, as Mike Brady, is astounding. His voice and mannerisms are so unbelieveably Robert Reed, that it is nothing short of creepy. He is perfect. The kids are incredible. Christine Taylor as Marcia is a clone of T.V. Marcia. Right on the money. And, by the way, what a hot Marcia!. Michael McKean and Jean Smart as the neighbors are equally entertaining. Some of the jokes are sorta mean, but that's what makes it work. It's sort of making fun of the Brady's. There are several jokes and scenes that are spoofs of storylines in actual Brady episodes. If you don't know your Brady stuff, then a lot of the jokes will go right over your head. Of course, there are a number of the original cast members that pop up through the film. That was very welcome. Many people have said how stupid this film was. It's not stupid. If people think it was, then it's only because that's the way it was supposed to be. Making fun of the Brady's and their own way of the world circa the 1970's. If you call the movie stupid, your not slamming the movie. Your only praising it. That was the point.

Snippets like Bobby saving a girl from a falling shelf, orange hair and some sort of model volcano explosion. Nothing very distinctive at all. So when the movie came out in '95, I gave it a shot and didn't like it at all. It just seemed like another fish-out-of-water movie, and the jokes were of the inside type, which was to be expected for a movie based on a TV show. They just weren't funny. So I dismissed the movie (which apparently was pretty popular) and didn't even bother with it's sequel, which came out the next year.Fast forward ten years to 2005. Thanks to the wonders of TV-on-DVD, I took another shot and bought the 1st season of The Brady Bunch and immediately got hooked. As I watched the episodes, those snippets suddenly became cohesive and the memories flowed back in. The warm, fuzzy, memories of a ""simpler"" time with the impossibly perfect family. As I eagerly awaited the subsequent season releases over the next year and a half, I held off on giving The Brady Bunch Movie a second chance until I had seen every episode again. I'm glad I did. Basically what I'm trying to say is that you definitely need to be familiar with the show, to fully appreciate the movie(s).As I mentioned previously the movie takes the fish-out-of-water, squeaky-clean 70's Brady's and places them in the 90's. While you get your usual riffs on the culture clash enveloped in a pedestrian plot (albeit, their oblivious attitude is good for some laughs), the real comedic meat comes from the spoofing of the show. Swollen noses, squeaky voices, inner monologues, ""Marcia, Marcia, Marcia"", the life lessons, the clothes, breaking into song. It's all there in their glorious cheesiness, deftly presented by the cast, with special kudos going to the spot-on portrayals of Mr. & Mrs. Brady, Marcia, Jan & Alice. Actually Ben Stiller probably says to himself every day, ""I can't believe I landed Marcia Brady!"" Christine Taylor IS Marcia Brady. And look for some great cameos as well.Good, hilarious fun for Brady fans. Of course after this, I just had to run out and get A Very Brady Sequel, which is even better! Incest! The real Mr. Brady!

Despite my resistance the Brady Bunch seeped into my subconsious.  As for the film, they got the right actors to play the Bradys particularly Gary Cole(absolutely brilliant in ""Office Space"" and ""Ricky Bobby""), Shelley Long, Christine Taylor (eerie resemblance to Maureen McCormick), and Jennifer Elise Cox.  The conceit of this film is that that the Bradys are living in the day-glo seventies while the world around them is nineties grunge.

At times a ridiculously over-the-top parody of the already corn-laden show and at other times a cunny and dead on satire of 70's fluff and 90's grunge, this movie is 100% brilliant. You probably did not ever expect to hear the word &quot;brilliant&quot; in the same sentence as Brady Bunch. As I am not a working movie critic, it can be assumed that i am wrong. But i must say that in the past ten years i have not laughed harder, longer or more repeatedly at any other movie than this. And believe me, i have watched it quite a few times. Taking cue from the hilariously cheesy plots of the 70's TV show and feeding from there, the Brady Bunch Movie emerges as a rather smart, and laugh out loud funny movie. The cast could not be better with, as i mentioned before, Gary Cole, Christine Taylor (in, as Marcia, the role she was born to play) and Jennifer Elise Cox (as Jan in a nuanced comic performance) being the standouts.

377977,AQ4NJ2T9PVI3L,6303494080,"Kitten With a Whip ""kittenwithawhip""","[14, 17]","When I first heard about the concept of this movie, I thought it was dumb-I liked the idea of a BB movie, especially since the previews looked great, but then I read I review about how the Bradys are in a &quot;time  warp&quot; and the rest of the world is in the late 90's.  When I saw the  movie, all my fears were put to rest.  In fact, some of the &quot;culture  clash&quot; scenes of the Bradys interacting with the rest of the world  were the funniest, such as McKean's character not understanding a word of  what she's saying because of her lisp, an attempted car-jack &quot;Well,  this is a car. But my name's not Jack!&quot; and Marcia's best female  friend being a lesbian with a hopeless crush on her.There's not really  enough room to say enough good things about this movie, but here's some of  them. First, the dead-on impressions are great, especially Alice, Jan, and  Marcia, but Robert Reed is really the stand-out-he sounds more like Mike  Brady than Mike Brady, and has his mannerisms down perfect. Lots of  in-jokes and references that kids who didn't watch the show won't get but  those of us like me that did will get: for instance, when Carol kisses Mike  goodbye when he leaves for work, she says, &quot;See ya later, Tiger!  (pause) Tiger...Tiger...I wonder what ever happened to that dog?&quot; the  blackboard in the kitchen has &quot;porkchops and applesauce&quot; written  on it, etc.  They even manage to throw in a reference to Johnny Bravo. The  period detail is great including the costumes. There's some little sexual  innuendo thrown in, but it fits in with the movie and the characters  perfectly-one of the funniest scenes is when Carol and Mike think they're  alone, and she's sitting on his lap whispering what is probably something  dirty in his ear, and he's saying &quot;Uh-huh...You would...I see...&quot;  exactly like Mike Brady does when he's talking to someone on the phone.  They include the popular Brady songs like &quot;Sunshine Day&quot; (always  kind of grated on me, but they do a great version in a Sears store) and the  horrible one that starts &quot;Clowns never laughed before...&quot; but  &quot;Keep On&quot; is actually a pretty catchy one. They recreate many  famous moments/plots from the show, such as Marcia's nose getting broken  (&quot;Oh! My nose!&quot;) to Jan's delight, potato sack races, Jan hating  her new glasses, Bobby being the Safety Monitor at school, and plenty more.  The plot (yes, it actually has one) involves the Brady family's efforts to  save their beloved home from an evil land-developer. Highly recommended,  even if you're not a Brady completist. Watch for the cameos from 4 original  cast members-the best was the real Alice playing a truck driver (hmmm,  always though Alice was a little butch) picking up hitch-hiking Jan who has  run away from home.Most importantly to me, though this is a parody, the  moviemakers make fun of the show while still staying true to the spirit of  it and the characters. All their naivete is actually sweet rather than  annoying-Marcia wears hideous 70's clothes but carries herself like a  princess, Greg wants to make friends with the car-jacker, assuming he must  need a spare tire, Mike explains how he wouldn't sell his house for any  price because he designed it himself with love. During one scene, Marcia  and Jan go to a &quot;Teen Model&quot; tryout (Jan is instantly booted) and  the photographer/agent tells her she needs to cut her hair, get breast  implants, and lose some weight. She slaps, him horrified: &quot;CUT MY  HAIR?  How dare you!&quot; Greg's lines to pick up chicks (well, it seems  like this is his only opening pickup line) is &quot;Hey groovy chick.  You  look really happening in a far out way!&quot; are actually  endearing.Everyone with a sense of humor and fun will probably like this  movie, and those of us who grew up on the show will absolutely love it.",5,Groovy movie that is really happening in a far-out way!,963446400,"07 13, 2000",2000,3917,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'concept', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'dumb-I', 'liked', 'idea', 'BB', 'movie', 'especially', 'previews', 'looked', 'great', 'then', 'read', 'review', 'how', 'Bradys', 'are', 'quot', 'time', 'warp', 'quot', 'rest', 'world', 'late', '90', 'When', 'saw', 'movie', 'fears', 'were', 'put', 'rest', 'fact', 'quot', 'culture', 'clash', 'quot', 'scenes', 'Bradys', 'interacting', 'rest', 'world', 'were', 'funniest', 'such', 'McKean', 'character', 'not', 'understanding', 'word', 'what', 'saying', 'lisp', 'attempted', 'car-jack', 'quot', 'Well', 'car', 'name', 'not', 'Jack', 'quot', 'Marcia', 'best', 'female', 'friend', 'being', 'lesbian', 'hopeless', 'crush', 'her.There', 'not', 'really', 'enough', 'room', 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'movie', 'here', 'First', 'dead-on', 'impressions', 'are', 'great', 'especially', 'Alice', 'Jan', 'Marcia', 'Robert', 'Reed', 'really', 'stand-out-he', 'more', 'Mike', 'Brady', 'Mike', 'Brady', 'mannerisms', 'down', 'perfect', 'Lots', 'in-jokes', 'references', 'kids', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'show', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'did', 'will', 'get', 'instance', 'when', 'Carol', 'Mike', 'goodbye', 'when', 'work', 'quot', 'See', 'ya', 'later', 'Tiger', 'pause', 'Tiger', 'Tiger', 'wonder', 'what', 'ever', 'happened', 'dog', 'quot', 'blackboard', 'kitchen', 'quot', 'porkchops', 'applesauce', 'quot', 'written', 'etc', 'even', 'manage', 'throw', 'reference', 'Johnny', 'Bravo', 'period', 'detail', 'great', 'including', 'costumes', 'little', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'thrown', 'movie', 'characters', 'perfectly-one', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'when', 'Carol', 'Mike', 'think', ""'re"", 'alone', 'sitting', 'lap', 'whispering', 'what', 'probably', 'something', 'dirty', 'ear', 'saying', 'quot', 'Uh-huh', 'would', 'see', 'quot', 'exactly', 'Mike', 'Brady', 'when', 'talking', 'someone', 'phone', 'include', 'popular', 'Brady', 'songs', 'quot', 'Sunshine', 'Day', 'quot', 'always', 'kind', 'grated', 'do', 'great', 'version', 'Sears', 'store', 'horrible', 'one', 'quot', 'Clowns', 'never', 'laughed', 'quot', 'quot', 'Keep', 'quot', 'actually', 'pretty', 'catchy', 'one', 'recreate', 'many', 'famous', 'moments/plots', 'show', 'such', 'Marcia', 'nose', 'getting', 'broken', 'quot', 'Oh', 'nose', 'quot', 'Jan', 'delight', 'potato', 'sack', 'races', 'Jan', 'hating', 'new', 'glasses', 'Bobby', 'being', 'Safety', 'Monitor', 'school', 'plenty', 'more', 'plot', 'yes', 'actually', 'one', 'Brady', 'family', 'efforts', 'save', 'beloved', 'home', 'evil', 'land-developer', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'Brady', 'completist', 'Watch', 'cameos', '4', 'original', 'cast', 'members-the', 'best', 'was', 'real', 'Alice', 'playing', 'truck', 'driver', 'hmmm', 'always', 'Alice', 'was', 'little', 'butch', 'picking', 'up', 'hitch-hiking', 'Jan', 'who', 'run', 'away', 'home.Most', 'importantly', 'parody', 'moviemakers', 'make', 'fun', 'show', 'still', 'staying', 'true', 'spirit', 'characters', 'naivete', 'actually', 'sweet', 'rather', 'annoying-Marcia', 'wears', 'hideous', '70', 'clothes', 'princess', 'Greg', 'make', 'friends', 'car-jacker', 'assuming', 'must', 'need', 'spare', 'tire', 'Mike', 'how', 'would', ""n't"", 'sell', 'house', 'price', 'designed', 'love', 'one', 'scene', 'Marcia', 'Jan', 'go', 'quot', 'Teen', 'Model', 'quot', 'tryout', 'Jan', 'instantly', 'booted', 'photographer/agent', 'cut', 'hair', 'get', 'breast', 'implants', 'lose', 'weight', 'slaps', 'horrified', 'quot', 'CUT', 'MY', 'HAIR', 'How', 'dare', 'quot', 'Greg', 'lines', 'pick', 'up', 'chicks', 'well', 'only', 'opening', 'pickup', 'line', 'quot', 'Hey', 'groovy', 'chick', 'look', 'really', 'happening', 'far', 'out', 'way', 'quot', 'are', 'actually', 'endearing.Everyone', 'sense', 'humor', 'fun', 'will', 'probably', 'movie', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'show', 'will', 'absolutely', 'love']",The Brady Bunch Movie VHS

How many of us today would love to see one of the corniest families of television put into modern day and look like geeks? I sure would!This is a hilarious take on The Brady Bunch. Combining their 60s trends and attitude and throwing it into the present is genius. There are so many funny jokes regarding the Bradys standing out as a bunch of geeks living in the past.The acting is superb. Every actor portrayed his or her own Brady character exactly the way the orgininal acted. Most of the actors even look like the orginal actors, especially Alice!Now, don't get me wrong, you don't have to be a huge fan of the show to find this funny. But, it does help you appreciate the ties to the T.V. show if you grew up watching it or did what I did and watch it all the time on Nick at Nite!So, if you want to see a hilarious take on the Bradys living in current day and being made fun of along with the good ol' Brady humor we loved from the show, this one's for you!",3,"Funny, well-done satire.",1122940800,"08 2, 2005",2005,1000,"['Now', 'what', 'call', 'funny', 'stuff', 'How', 'many', 'today', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'one', 'corniest', 'families', 'television', 'put', 'modern', 'day', 'look', 'geeks', 'sure', 'would', 'hilarious', 'take', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'Combining', '60s', 'trends', 'attitude', 'throwing', 'present', 'genius', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'funny', 'jokes', 'regarding', 'Bradys', 'standing', 'out', 'bunch', 'geeks', 'living', 'past.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'actor', 'portrayed', 'own', 'Brady', 'character', 'exactly', 'way', 'orgininal', 'acted', 'Most', 'actors', 'even', 'look', 'orginal', 'actors', 'especially', 'Alice', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'huge', 'fan', 'show', 'find', 'funny', 'help', 'appreciate', 'ties', 'T.V', 'show', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'watch', 'time', 'Nick', 'Nite', 'So', 'want', 'see', 'hilarious', 'take', 'Bradys', 'living', 'current', 'day', 'being', 'made', 'fun', 'good', 'ol', 'Brady', 'humor', 'loved', 'show', 'one']",The Brady Bunch Movie VHS
377984,A17M20ISV4BP07,6303494080,"Peter Saenz ""Artemisboy""","[30, 32]","I remember watching this movie in the theatres. The audience was packed and I LOVED every minute of it. Shelly Long made an outstanding Carol Brady, loving wife and doting mother to six (count 'em six) children. The movie captured the classic camp of the television show perfectly down to trademark episode storylines inter-woven into a bigger story. The real stand out actors though has to be Christine Taylor as Marcia and Jennifer Elise Cox as Jan. The dynamic duo really set the stage with not only their remarkable resemblance to the characters but the way they captured even the inflections of the blonde Brady girls. It was almost like being taken back to the series. And speaking of which, several original series cast members make cameo appearances in the film, such as Florence Henderson as Grandma Brady, Barry Williams as a music producer, Ann B. Davis as Shultzy (named as an homage to her character on the Bob Cummings Show), and Christopher Knight as the school coach. And you can't miss the ever talented Jean Smart or RuPaul as the drunk next door neighbor and school guidence counselor. The drawbacks of the DVD release though is that Paramount skimped on any bonus material. We are benefited with seeing the movie in crystal clear widescreen and in Dolby sound, but there are no behind-the-scenes clips added though such material was shown on television when the movie was just released. There are no character/actor bios. There are no photo stills. There are no Brady song montages. There isn't even a movie trailer of the movie itself. There is just simply nothing added to make this DVD as special as it could have been than just the movie standing alone. In my mind, the purpose of releasing a movie on DVD at all is to provide the audience with a higher level of product than you would recieve on a standard videotape. Because the movie wasn't released with any of these I have to grudgingly give the DVD a three out of five stars. Not because the movie isn't good, because it is. It's one of my favorites. No, I gave it three stars because companies such as Paramount and others like them really should know better. The word 'cheated' comes to mind.",3,Great Movie - Disappointing DVD,1055203200,"06 10, 2003",2003,2174,"['remember', 'watching', 'movie', 'theatres', 'audience', 'was', 'packed', 'LOVED', 'minute', 'Shelly', 'Long', 'made', 'outstanding', 'Carol', 'Brady', 'loving', 'wife', 'doting', 'mother', 'six', 'count', ""'em"", 'six', 'children', 'movie', 'captured', 'classic', 'camp', 'television', 'show', 'perfectly', 'down', 'trademark', 'episode', 'storylines', 'inter-woven', 'bigger', 'story', 'real', 'stand', 'out', 'actors', 'though', 'be', 'Christine', 'Taylor', 'Marcia', 'Jennifer', 'Elise', 'Cox', 'Jan', 'dynamic', 'duo', 'really', 'set', 'stage', 'not', 'only', 'remarkable', 'resemblance', 'characters', 'way', 'captured', 'even', 'inflections', 'blonde', 'Brady', 'girls', 'was', 'almost', 'being', 'taken', 'back', 'series', 'speaking', 'several', 'original', 'series', 'cast', 'members', 'make', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'film', 'such', 'Florence', 'Henderson', 'Grandma', 'Brady', 'Barry', 'Williams', 'music', 'producer', 'Ann', 'B.', 'Davis', 'Shultzy', 'named', 'homage', 'character', 'Bob', 'Cummings', 'Show', 'Christopher', 'Knight', 'school', 'coach', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'ever', 'talented', 'Jean', 'Smart', 'RuPaul', 'drunk', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'school', 'guidence', 'counselor', 'drawbacks', 'DVD', 'release', 'though', 'Paramount', 'skimped', 'bonus', 'material', 'are', 'benefited', 'seeing', 'movie', 'crystal', 'clear', 'widescreen', 'Dolby', 'sound', 'are', 'behind-the-scenes', 'clips', 'added', 'such', 'material', 'was', 'shown', 'television', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'released', 'are', 'character/actor', 'bios', 'are', 'photo', 'are', 'Brady', 'song', 'montages', ""n't"", 'even', 'movie', 'trailer', 'movie', 'just', 'simply', 'nothing', 'added', 'make', 'DVD', 'as', 'special', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'movie', 'standing', 'alone', 'mind', 'purpose', 'releasing', 'movie', 'DVD', 'provide', 'audience', 'higher', 'level', 'product', 'would', 'recieve', 'standard', 'videotape', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'released', 'have', 'grudgingly', 'give', 'DVD', 'three', 'five', 'stars', 'Not', 'movie', ""n't"", 'good', 'one', 'favorites', 'No', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', 'companies', 'such', 'Paramount', 'others', 'really', 'should', 'know', 'better', 'word', ""'cheated"", 'mind']",The Brady Bunch Movie VHS

So if you're a 90's kid, the movie is worth watching for the terrible grunge attire, mom jeans paired with cropped thermals, etc. All the typical Brady-isms are heightened and Jan's jealousy of Marsha turns to psychosis.

I enjoyed watching the television show when I was a kid, but it wasn't one of my favorite shows. However, this film really surprised me and turned out to be the funniest movie I've seen in years.The movie is hilarious. It parodies everything that made the Brady the Bradys (Cindy's lisp, Mike's family talks, potato sack races, etc) . All the actors have a dead-on impersonations of the original characters and make the spoof totally believable.The major plot of the film is fairly simple. The Brady's owe $20,000 in back taxes and their beloved home is going to be sold if they can't raise the funds. Their next door neighbor is a greedy developer who wants to build a shopping mall in the Bradys neighborhood. All the other homeowners have sold, but the Bradys won't bite. The desperate developer seems to have lost, until he finds out about the Bradys' back taxes. Then things get messy. There is also a subplot revolving around Jan's struggle with being a middle child and always being overlooked by Marcia. Jan's &quot;struggle&quot; is one of the most hilarious things I have seen on film in a long time. You'll never think of hearing voices the same again (or Jan Brady for that matter).Overall a hilarious film that parodies the original television series. The movie has the blessing of the Bradys creator (he wrote the screenplay). It is a delight for anyone who remembers the original series and even if you don't, you're sure to have a few laughs with this 70's family living in a modern world.",5,Come on Home with the Bradys.,987984000,"04 23, 2001",2001,1584,"['When', 'first', 'watched', 'movie', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'television', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'However', 'film', 'really', 'surprised', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'funniest', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years.The', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'everything', 'made', 'Brady', 'Bradys', 'Cindy', 'lisp', 'Mike', 'family', 'talks', 'potato', 'sack', 'races', 'etc', 'actors', 'have', 'dead-on', 'impersonations', 'original', 'characters', 'make', 'spoof', 'totally', 'believable.The', 'major', 'plot', 'film', 'fairly', 'simple', 'Brady', 'owe', '20,000', 'back', 'taxes', 'beloved', 'home', 'going', 'be', 'sold', 'ca', ""n't"", 'raise', 'funds', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'greedy', 'developer', 'who', 'build', 'shopping', 'mall', 'Bradys', 'neighborhood', 'other', 'homeowners', 'have', 'sold', 'Bradys', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bite', 'desperate', 'developer', 'have', 'lost', 'out', 'Bradys', 'back', 'taxes', 'Then', 'things', 'get', 'messy', 'also', 'subplot', 'revolving', 'Jan', 'struggle', 'being', 'middle', 'child', 'always', 'being', 'overlooked', 'Marcia', 'Jan', 'quot', 'quot', 'one', 'most', 'hilarious', 'things', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'long', 'time', ""'ll"", 'never', 'think', 'hearing', 'voices', 'same', 'again', 'Jan', 'Brady', 'matter', 'hilarious', 'film', 'original', 'television', 'series', 'movie', 'blessing', 'Bradys', 'creator', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'delight', 'anyone', 'who', 'original', 'series', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", ""'re"", 'sure', 'have', 'few', '70', 'family', 'living', 'modern', 'world']",The Brady Bunch Movie VHS
