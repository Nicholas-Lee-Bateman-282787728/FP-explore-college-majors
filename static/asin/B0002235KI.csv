821243,ARDYNGFRFXZJH,B0002235KI,Aaron Shannon,"[2, 6]","I liked this movie a lot. I'm definitely going to buy it in the future. I guess I don't know the difference between good acting and bad acting, because I watch a lot of movies that I think the acting was just fine, yet others seem to find the acting bad.  I liked the story, the action, the fighting, the scenery, etc.  I say it is a great movie, but I'm in no position to recommend movies I like to others, because most people are too picky and have high standards.  I loved this movie because it entertained me.

As usual, Garey Busey portrayed the antagonist as well as anyone can. Being a huge fan of Michael Worth, the karate was great, as ususal, but I do not think I have ever see him do a better job of acting. Busey and aoo of his antagonists almost dominated the movie as much as Worth's character. The reconcilliaton of the brothers at the end was great, and unexpected. This movie had a little touch of comedy which offset all the killing. I really enjoyed this movie. Andrianne Barbeau is as beautiful as ever. Would have liked to seen her ""one knock out punch"" more often.This movie combined karate and cowboy just great, but I never want to see Clint Eastwood turning fifty flips in the air , screaming at the top of his lung , just to throw a karate chop to the head that gets blocked by a 357 Magnum.

821249,AESFW5DZC2XO7,B0002235KI,"Matthew C. Stelly ""Global Genius""","[2, 3]","This movie is a combination of a western, a kung fu flick and a mixed up melodrama that takes place during the lifetime of some young kids who watch a town get wiped out. One kid watches two of his friends get shot down, but grows up to find out that the girl is indeed alive and well and also seeking vengeance against the ne'er do wells who shot up their loved ones. Jeff Fahey gets top billing in this movie, but that was the same kind of scam that the movie ""The Faculty"" ran on Usher Raymond; use the name, get the crowd's attention so that the crowd can find out, much too late, that the person only appears for a few minutes. Fahey appears on screen for all of three minutes, all told. The remainder of the cast appears as confused about what's going on as the viewer. People are getting shot, hand-to hand combat degenerates into name-calling -- here's what I think happened. The guy who wrote it had a of ideas and only a little bit of money. So he sold the rights to somebody who had some ideas and very little money. The product is 'ghost rock.' And now, the final point which should prove how goony this flick is, and I can tell you in two words: Gary Busey. This man has issues. He hasn't been the same since he appeared in ""Predator 2."" In this movie he's the super cocky town power baron who wants everybody to know he's running things. But in one scene when he's in the bar, having just gunned down the bartender, and shouts ""who's town is this?"" not one person responds! And from there, it only gets worse.
