The great characters: Craig, His sister, mother, and most of all, Smoky were all gone. His father was in it, and hilarious but the size of His part was garbage. That's right, it was shorter than a trip to the corner store around the block.I don't recommend this movie much.

But I promise You, they didn't quite bring the funny in this one.

38449,A5DIAZ5GT3MC,0780631234,Crazy Jim,"[0, 1]","Ice Cube returns for the second installment in the &quot;Friday&quot; franchise. This time, he's moving out of the hood and into his rich uncle's home in Rancho Cucamonga. Chris Tucker's out of the picture and in his place is Mike Epps as Cube's wacky cousin. Also returning for this one are John Witherspoon and Tiny &quot;Zeus&quot; Lister but a majority of the characters are brand new to the series with Don &quot;D.C.&quot; Curry, Tamala Jones, Clifton Powell, Justin Pierce, and Sticky Fingaz joining the ensemble cast.&quot;Next Friday&quot; has Craig moving out to the 'burbs when he learns that the neighborhood bully, Deebo (Lister) has escaped from prison and is looking for him. The suburbs prove to be just as much trouble as he has to deal with the Latino thugs who live next door, a trigger-happy record store owner, and his cousin's obsessive ex-girlfriend. When it turns out that his uncle has just 24 hours to come up with some money to cover some unpaid taxes on the house, Cube devises a plan that has him, his cousin, Day-Day (Epps), and their token white friend (the late Justin Pierce) breaking into the next door neighbor's house.&quot;Next Friday&quot; is a decent follow-up but the loss of co-writer DJ Pooh and star Chris Tucker is a lot to get over. Epps puts in a humorous comedic performance but he's no Tucker. The new characters are hit and miss. Amy Hill's Asian neighbor is a weak and tired sterotype-driven character. If you can't tell that Hill isn't Korean by looking at her, her awful attempt at an accent will give it away. Jacob Vargas as the loud-mouthed Latio neighbor is entertaining though they seemed to have run out of material for him in some areas. Sticky Fingaz is hilarious as Tyrone, Deebo's prison sidekick and Lisa Rodriguez is easy on the eyes as Cube's love interest.While it's not on the same level as the original, &quot;Next Friday&quot; has more than a few laughs. Cube and Epps have pretty good chemistry and the suburban backdrop makes for a nice change of pace for an urban comedy (it's certainly done more effectively than on Fox's &quot;Red And Meth&quot;). The DVD presentation has a lot of cool extra features including an alternate ending, the Mike Epps audition tape, and an audio commentary by director Steve Carr.",3,&quot;Next Friday&quot; DVD Review!,1088899200,"07 4, 2004",2004,2283,"['Ice', 'Cube', 'second', 'installment', 'quot', 'Friday', 'quot', 'franchise', 'time', 'moving', 'hood', 'rich', 'uncle', 'home', 'Rancho', 'Cucamonga', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'out', 'picture', 'place', 'Mike', 'Epps', 'Cube', 'wacky', 'cousin', 'Also', 'returning', 'one', 'are', 'John', 'Witherspoon', 'Tiny', 'quot', 'Zeus', 'quot', 'Lister', 'majority', 'characters', 'are', 'brand', 'new', 'series', 'Don', 'quot', 'D.C.', 'quot', 'Curry', 'Tamala', 'Jones', 'Clifton', 'Powell', 'Justin', 'Pierce', 'Sticky', 'Fingaz', 'joining', 'ensemble', 'cast.', 'quot', 'Next', 'Friday', 'quot', 'Craig', 'moving', 'out', ""'burbs"", 'when', 'neighborhood', 'bully', 'Deebo', 'Lister', 'escaped', 'prison', 'looking', 'suburbs', 'prove', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'trouble', 'deal', 'Latino', 'thugs', 'who', 'live', 'next', 'door', 'trigger-happy', 'record', 'store', 'owner', 'cousin', 'obsessive', 'ex-girlfriend', 'When', 'out', 'uncle', 'just', '24', 'hours', 'come', 'up', 'money', 'cover', 'unpaid', 'taxes', 'house', 'Cube', 'plan', 'cousin', 'Day-Day', 'Epps', 'token', 'white', 'friend', 'late', 'Justin', 'Pierce', 'breaking', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'house.', 'quot', 'Next', 'Friday', 'quot', 'decent', 'follow-up', 'loss', 'co-writer', 'DJ', 'Pooh', 'star', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'lot', 'get', 'over', 'Epps', 'humorous', 'comedic', 'performance', 'Tucker', 'new', 'characters', 'are', 'hit', 'miss', 'Amy', 'Hill', 'Asian', 'neighbor', 'weak', 'tired', 'sterotype-driven', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Hill', ""n't"", 'Korean', 'looking', 'awful', 'attempt', 'accent', 'will', 'give', 'away', 'Jacob', 'Vargas', 'loud-mouthed', 'Latio', 'neighbor', 'entertaining', 'seemed', 'have', 'run', 'material', 'areas', 'Sticky', 'Fingaz', 'hilarious', 'Tyrone', 'Deebo', 'prison', 'sidekick', 'Lisa', 'Rodriguez', 'easy', 'eyes', 'Cube', 'love', 'interest.While', 'not', 'same', 'level', 'original', 'quot', 'Next', 'Friday', 'quot', 'more', 'few', 'laughs', 'Cube', 'Epps', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'chemistry', 'suburban', 'backdrop', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'urban', 'comedy', 'certainly', 'done', 'more', 'effectively', 'Fox', 'quot', 'Red', 'Meth', 'quot', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'lot', 'cool', 'extra', 'features', 'including', 'alternate', 'ending', 'Mike', 'Epps', 'audition', 'tape', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Steve', 'Carr']",N/A

But he settled for no talent Mike Epps, he's whiny, annoying, not funny at all, and has no chemistry with Ice Cube.  You could tell Craig was superior to Day Day, at least with Craig and Smokey they were pretty much equal, Smokey didn't let Craig run all over him.  Have you notice that Mike has only been in Ice Cube movies because nobody else wants him (and who would with talents like Chris Tucker, Martin, and Bernie Mac to name a few out there who are actually funny), okay yeah he had a small part in How High, like that movie is real credible.  Anyway it might have been better if Cube could have gotten somebody other than Mike Epps to be his sidekick.If I wanted to see the same storyline rehashed from the first, then I would just watch the first movie at least I can see Chris Tucker rather than Mike Epps.Like I before, this one was not funny, I think Kim Whitley and the mexicans got a light chuckle out of me, but other than that I didn't really laugh.

I like to see credit go to were  credit is due. Many people said &quot;Oh! Chris Tucker is not going to be  in the sequel, there's no way this movie will succeed&quot;. After making  millions of $ at the box office and similar success on video &quot;Next  Friday&quot; has secured its own spot as a comedy classic. Next Friday did  not need smokey (Chris Tucker)and went on to be twice as successful than  the original &quot;Friday&quot; at the box office. Ice Cube's (craig)  performance is great but Mike Epps (day-day) really gets your attention  with his off beat and very funny humor. When you add Don &quot;D.C.&quot;  Curry (uncle Elroy) &amp; John Witherspoon (craig's father)in the mix,you  got some serious comedy going on. Check out this movie on DVD, there's all  types of special features and fun stuff packed onto the disc. There's  always going to be those who want to bring down this movie because the  first one was so good. In many ways I believe &quot;Next Friday&quot; was  better than the original &quot;Friday&quot;. One reason in particular, is  the fact that in Next Friday you get to see more movement with the scenes.  The characters are not stuck on a front porch all day and night long like  the original Friday. The first Friday indeed was a classic but Next Friday  definately holds its own as a sequel. Before you try to bash a film before  watching, just watch it first. I did and I was pleasently surprised by how  good and funny Next Friday was.

After I saw it, I gotta say I was wrong because NEXT FRIDAY was really funny and all out a great sequel to it's original FRIDAY.In this one, Craig (Ice Cube) is going to his Uncle Elroy's for a little while.  After a few days of hanging out and doing whatever with his cousin Dae Dae (Mike Epps), Craig signs for a special delivery and the letter states that his Uncle Elroy owes a lot of money because of a delinquent property tax payment and now his Uncle will lose his house if they can't get the money.  So now Craig and Dae Dae have to fund the money so they don't lose the house, dodge their next door neighbors the Joker brothers that want to take it to them, Dae Dae has to dodge his ex-girlfriend and her destructive sister and the word is out that Debo has broken out of prison and he's looking for Craig.  It's another great, kick back and laugh out loud comedy.Like I said before, just because Chris Tucker isn't in this one doesn't mean that it's bad.  I thought it was pretty funny and Epps really doesn't replace Tucker.  In my opinion, Epps just adds a new character to the mix and Cube and Epps are funny as hell together.  Plus this one has a lot more laughs.  Granted yes, most of the comedy circles around the pot smoking but the parts that don't are really funny.Just remember, if you want to check out NEXT FRIDAY you have to check out FRIDAY first or you'll miss some jokes and there will be holes in the plot as well.

There are plenty of stoner jokes, sex jokes, toilet jokes, etc. Don't expect it to be top-notch comedy, because that's not what it's trying to be.

The characters for the movie weren't as serious as Debo was in the first and were more of a joke than the neighbors to watch out for.The story was obvious, Craig had to escape from the ghetto after the heat was still on him, and after Debo's arrest, he saw an oppurtunity to visit his cousin and uncle in the suburbs of CukoMongo. He is then adapted to the sweet life then soon finds out how hard it was for his cousin Dede to go through life with druged up Mexicans next door and a physco ***** on his case. The storyline also involves Craig's nemisis, Debo breaking out of jail, intent on killing Craig and gain his reputation back as he is accompanied by a new sidekick.The movie isn't as funny as Friday, characters weren't playing big roles and most of all, Chris Tucker's character Smokey, who was in 'rehab' wasn't in this movie at all. But that doesn't seem to be the bigger part of the problem.If you like the Cube/Epps duo in movies, then watch Next Friday.

38494,AYB0IXBPBJ20A,0780631234,"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee""","[1, 2]","When a sequel to a movie as critically acclaimed as Friday is released, expectations are always high. I've heard people say numerous times that they were disappointed that this movie wasn't as funny as Friday. &quot;It  needed Chris Tucker.&quot;  That's B.S.  This movie needed a different  writer, a revamped cast, and a major plot overhaul.I love Ice Cube to  death, but he is NOT a screenwriter. Period, pointblank.  This movie had  numerous holes(Craig's motivation for leaving was flimsy if you think about  it) that a much more polished writer would have taken the time to touch up  on. The majority of the jokes in this movie were either variations on gags  from the first film or were flat out unfunny(el Negro? Come on!).  Pinky  was little more than a rehashed Big Worm, only with half the importance and  half the comedic value.Don't get me wrong, this movie has it's moments.  Keyword: MOMENTS. When put together and taken as a whole, this movie's plot  is disjointed and disorganized. Chris Tucker may have sold out by not  wanting to do certain &quot;roles&quot; ever again, but even I can't blame  him for not wanting to be a part of this mess. This one ranks right up  there with Cool World on my short list of worst films of the last 20 years.",1,You call this a movie?
