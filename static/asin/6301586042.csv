256617,A1D2LB4Z5RMO4M,6301586042,Amanda Pike,"[1, 1]","I am writing this review to remind people there are better works of supernatural romance out there than Twilight.  The Ghost and Mrs. Muir is one such example.  The novel was written in 1945 and then adapted into a film with George Sanders and later a TV series.The ghost and Mrs. Muir tells the story of a young widow, Lucy Muir who has decided she wants to break away from the control of her over-bearing and dominating in-laws.  Already by this point the feminism and strength of the protagonist of the 1945 novel exceeds that of the more modern supernatural romance Twilight.  When Lucy Muir finds a house to her liking she discovers very quickly that it is haunted by a very vocal spectre of an old sea captain by the name of Captain Daniel Gregg.The ghost of Captain Daniel Gregg is one of my three favourite fiction ghosts. The list consists of Captain Daniel Gregg of The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, Sir Simon de Canterville from The Canterville Ghost by Oscar Wilde and Hrothbert of Bainbridge AKA Bob from the short lived television series adaptation of The Dresden Files by Jim Butcher (Hrothbert of Bainbridge doesn't exist in the actual Dresden Files novels).Despite the ghost's seeming misogyny Lucy and the captain develop a quirky and strangely affectionate relationship. For all of his roughness and snark the captain is actually a gentleman inside.  The character portrayals are realistic and very human unlike the protagonists of Twilight in which the characters are two dimensional archetypes to appeal to a shallow demographic.The Ghost and Mrs. Muir isn't just a sweet romance.  It also has a running wit and humour completely lacking in most modern romances.  It seems today all attempts at humour in romance become self-parodies.  There's more to the story than just fluff. It's about taking control of your own life, standing up for yourself, independence, love and moving on, the power of love and friendship, and the value of love, life and family (no matter how unusual the definition might be) all told with excellent wit and humour.The Ghost and Mrs. Muir is highly underrated.  It deserves more attention.  It is a brilliant story far ahead of it's time.  I actually wish there would be a new film adaptation of The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, not because I think there is anything wrong with the first film adaptation, but because I think a new generation should be introduced to good supernatural romantic fiction and opposed to what is currently trendy and sadly many of the current generation won't watch a black and white film or read a novel more than twenty years old because they make negative assumptions about the content such as assuming it would be out dated, stuffy, cheesy or hard to follow.  The ghost and Mrs. Muir is none of these things. It's a head of the curb and I certainly would rather re-read The ghost and Mrs. Muir than Twilight.  Thanks to Terrence Mann's portrayal of Hrothbert of Bainbridge in the short lived Dresden Files TV series I can completely see him as Captain Daniel Gregg if there was a new film version to be made.I strongly recommend The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (film or book) to anyone interested in supernatural romance, ghost stories, dry wit, or just good literature in general.  This semi-obscure gem needs more attention and I truly feel it is of a higher quality in writing than what is currently fashionable in supernatural literature and fantasy.",5,A film and novel better than Twilight!,1258848000,"11 22, 2009",2009,3410,"['am', 'writing', 'review', 'remind', 'people', 'are', 'better', 'works', 'supernatural', 'romance', 'there', 'Twilight', 'Ghost', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', 'one', 'such', 'example', 'novel', 'was', 'written', '1945', 'then', 'adapted', 'film', 'George', 'Sanders', 'later', 'TV', 'series.The', 'ghost', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', 'story', 'young', 'widow', 'Lucy', 'Muir', 'who', 'decided', 'break', 'away', 'control', 'over-bearing', 'dominating', 'in-laws', 'Already', 'point', 'feminism', 'strength', 'protagonist', '1945', 'novel', 'more', 'modern', 'supernatural', 'romance', 'Twilight', 'When', 'Lucy', 'Muir', 'house', 'liking', 'very', 'quickly', 'haunted', 'very', 'vocal', 'spectre', 'old', 'sea', 'captain', 'name', 'Captain', 'Daniel', 'Gregg.The', 'ghost', 'Captain', 'Daniel', 'Gregg', 'one', 'three', 'favourite', 'fiction', 'ghosts', 'list', 'Captain', 'Daniel', 'Gregg', 'Ghost', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', 'Sir', 'Simon', 'de', 'Canterville', 'Canterville', 'Ghost', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'Hrothbert', 'Bainbridge', 'AKA', 'Bob', 'short', 'lived', 'television', 'series', 'adaptation', 'Dresden', 'Files', 'Jim', 'Butcher', 'Hrothbert', 'Bainbridge', ""n't"", 'exist', 'actual', 'Dresden', 'Files', 'novels', '.Despite', 'ghost', 'seeming', 'misogyny', 'Lucy', 'captain', 'develop', 'quirky', 'strangely', 'affectionate', 'relationship', 'roughness', 'snark', 'captain', 'actually', 'gentleman', 'inside', 'character', 'portrayals', 'are', 'realistic', 'very', 'human', 'protagonists', 'Twilight', 'characters', 'are', 'two', 'dimensional', 'archetypes', 'appeal', 'shallow', 'demographic.The', 'Ghost', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', ""n't"", 'just', 'sweet', 'romance', 'also', 'running', 'wit', 'humour', 'completely', 'lacking', 'most', 'modern', 'romances', 'today', 'attempts', 'humour', 'romance', 'become', 'self-parodies', 'more', 'story', 'just', 'fluff', 'taking', 'control', 'own', 'life', 'standing', 'up', 'independence', 'love', 'moving', 'power', 'love', 'friendship', 'value', 'love', 'life', 'family', 'matter', 'how', 'unusual', 'definition', 'might', 'be', 'told', 'excellent', 'wit', 'humour.The', 'Ghost', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', 'highly', 'underrated', 'more', 'attention', 'brilliant', 'story', 'far', 'ahead', 'time', 'actually', 'wish', 'would', 'be', 'new', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Ghost', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', 'not', 'think', 'anything', 'wrong', 'first', 'film', 'adaptation', 'think', 'new', 'generation', 'should', 'be', 'introduced', 'good', 'supernatural', 'romantic', 'fiction', 'opposed', 'what', 'currently', 'trendy', 'sadly', 'many', 'current', 'generation', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'read', 'novel', 'more', 'twenty', 'years', 'old', 'make', 'negative', 'assumptions', 'content', 'such', 'assuming', 'would', 'be', 'out', 'dated', 'stuffy', 'cheesy', 'hard', 'follow', 'ghost', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', 'none', 'things', 'head', 'curb', 'certainly', 'would', 'rather', 're-read', 'ghost', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', 'Twilight', 'Thanks', 'Terrence', 'Mann', 'portrayal', 'Hrothbert', 'Bainbridge', 'short', 'lived', 'Dresden', 'Files', 'TV', 'series', 'can', 'completely', 'see', 'Captain', 'Daniel', 'Gregg', 'was', 'new', 'film', 'version', 'be', 'made.I', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'Ghost', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', 'film', 'book', 'anyone', 'interested', 'supernatural', 'romance', 'ghost', 'stories', 'dry', 'wit', 'just', 'good', 'literature', 'general', 'semi-obscure', 'gem', 'more', 'attention', 'truly', 'feel', 'higher', 'quality', 'writing', 'what', 'currently', 'fashionable', 'supernatural', 'literature', 'fantasy']",N/A

256624,ANGH6401L9Y0T,6301586042,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 1]","Rex Harrison is dashing as Captain Daniel Gregg. The late Captain Daniel Gregg. Gene Tierney is beautiful and courageous as Mrs. Lucy Muir, a widow. George Sanders plays Miles Fairley as the rather smarmy character who may not be all she wants, but is flesh and blood. Natalie Wood plays her adorable daughter Anna.This movie is one of those they call classics, but that's not enough. I remember seeing it on TV when I was young, but it had either been chopped to pieces to make it fit the TV time frame or, even more likely, to chop out most of the sexual innuendo. Because it is just innuendo, after all; Captain Gregg has no flesh, erect or not.Lucy had a mother-in-law and a sister-in-law that were hard to get along with, to say the least. They refer to her husband as being ""barely cold in his grave"" when she's been in mourning for nearly a year. The mother-in-law weeps, and the sister-in-law pontificates. The audience's sympathies are therefore 100% on Lucy's side when she decides to leave off living with them in London and rents a cottage at the seaside. The cottage owned by the Captain's relatives and managed by an idiot estate agent in the village who does his best to steer Lucy away from the cottage. He does not say it is haunted, mind you; he just keeps telling her it's ""unsuitable."" But she finds it charming, and so against his advice, she rents it.The captain makes his appearance, so to speak, and after finding he can not scare her away, decides he likes her spirit (there are a lot of puns running through this review, aren't there?) and agrees to keep away from her daughter so as not to frighten her. But Lucy is living in his bedroom, and he makes himself at home. After all, he is at home. He wanted the house to go for a retired seamen's home, and that's why he's been haunting it and scaring everyone off. So she agrees she will leave it in her will for that purpose.But her income has suddenly dried up (the gold mine in which she inherited an interest has petered out and stopped paying dividends), and she worries that she will not be able to pay the rent to stay in the Captain's cottage. The Captain's response is to dictate his memoirs to her and she writes a book. She meets Miles Fairley at the publisher's office; he confesses to be Uncle Nedd, writer of children's stories, and she claims her daughter Anna adores his stories. In fact, the Captain says she hates Uncle Nedd's stories. Since the Captain had just said the night before that Lucia (as he calls her) should get out more, meet live people, especially men, she's amused at his apparent jealousy of Miles.It's probably obvious enough that the Captain and Mrs. Muir are falling in love, but the rest of the movie cannot be predicted on that fact, so I will leave it to you to watch it. It's a marvelous movie, with humor and romance and everything you could want except violence or gore. It's set at the beginning of the 20th century, and the period sets and costumes are charming and, I believe, quite authentic.",5,Deserves Its Status as a Classic Film,1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,3016,"['Rex', 'Harrison', 'dashing', 'Captain', 'Daniel', 'Gregg', 'late', 'Captain', 'Daniel', 'Gregg', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'beautiful', 'courageous', 'Mrs.', 'Lucy', 'Muir', 'widow', 'George', 'Sanders', 'Miles', 'Fairley', 'rather', 'smarmy', 'character', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'flesh', 'blood', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'adorable', 'daughter', 'Anna.This', 'movie', 'one', 'call', 'classics', 'not', 'enough', 'remember', 'seeing', 'TV', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'had', 'been', 'chopped', 'pieces', 'make', 'fit', 'TV', 'time', 'frame', 'even', 'more', 'likely', 'chop', 'out', 'most', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'just', 'innuendo', 'Captain', 'Gregg', 'flesh', 'erect', 'not.Lucy', 'had', 'mother-in-law', 'sister-in-law', 'were', 'hard', 'get', 'say', 'least', 'refer', 'husband', 'being', 'barely', 'cold', 'grave', 'when', 'been', 'mourning', 'nearly', 'year', 'mother-in-law', 'weeps', 'sister-in-law', 'pontificates', 'audience', 'sympathies', 'are', 'therefore', '100', '%', 'Lucy', 'side', 'when', 'leave', 'off', 'living', 'London', 'cottage', 'seaside', 'cottage', 'owned', 'Captain', 'relatives', 'managed', 'idiot', 'estate', 'agent', 'village', 'who', 'best', 'steer', 'Lucy', 'away', 'cottage', 'not', 'say', 'haunted', 'just', 'telling', 'unsuitable', 'charming', 'so', 'advice', 'it.The', 'captain', 'appearance', 'so', 'speak', 'finding', 'can', 'not', 'scare', 'away', 'spirit', 'are', 'lot', 'puns', 'running', 'review', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'keep', 'away', 'daughter', 'so', 'not', 'frighten', 'Lucy', 'living', 'bedroom', 'home', 'home', 'wanted', 'house', 'go', 'retired', 'seamen', 'home', 'why', 'been', 'haunting', 'scaring', 'everyone', 'off', 'will', 'leave', 'will', 'income', 'suddenly', 'dried', 'up', 'gold', 'mine', 'inherited', 'interest', 'petered', 'out', 'stopped', 'paying', 'dividends', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'pay', 'rent', 'stay', 'Captain', 'cottage', 'Captain', 'response', 'dictate', 'memoirs', 'book', 'Miles', 'Fairley', 'publisher', 'office', 'be', 'Uncle', 'Nedd', 'writer', 'children', 'stories', 'daughter', 'Anna', 'stories', 'fact', 'Captain', 'Uncle', 'Nedd', 'stories', 'Captain', 'had', 'just', 'said', 'night', 'Lucia', 'should', 'get', 'out', 'more', 'meet', 'live', 'people', 'especially', 'men', 'amused', 'apparent', 'jealousy', 'Miles.It', 'probably', 'obvious', 'enough', 'Captain', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', 'are', 'falling', 'love', 'rest', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'predicted', 'fact', 'will', 'leave', 'watch', 'marvelous', 'movie', 'humor', 'romance', 'everything', 'could', 'want', 'violence', 'gore', 'set', 'beginning', '20th', 'century', 'period', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'charming', 'believe', 'quite', 'authentic']",N/A

But more about that later.Young widow Lucy Muir (Gene Tierney) packs up her little daughter (Natalie Wood) and moves to the windswept English coast.  There she falls in love, first with an abandoned mansion overlooking the sea; and again with it's mysterious occupant, Captain Daniel Gregg (Rex Harrison)...a ghost.Despite their obvious differences, Daniel trusts Lucy enough to help him write his memoirs.  The money will help Lucy stay in the mansion without having to bother her tiresome in-laws.  Along the way, their special friendship blossoms into love, but could a ghost and a mortal ever find a common ground for happiness?Gene Tierney and Rex Harrison deliver gentle performances in this very singular love story, based on the bestselling novel by R.A. Dick.  Tierney is especially grand here, in a rare departure from the noir dramas that had catapulted her to super-stardom.THE GHOST AND MRS MUIR was filmed in 1947, a period in Gene Tierney's private life when she was under much emotional strain.  Her marriage to fashion designer Oleg Cassini was beginning to unravel, and her young daughter Daria was institutionalised due to severe physical and mental disabilities (sustained during pregnancy when Tierney came into contact with a fan who was sick with German Measles).  Despite what must have been happening in her private life, her performance as Lucy Muir is so delicate and nuanced, and simply perfection.  Everyone falls in love with her, including the audience (and Tierney's costumes here were designed by Cassini).The film also features an early performance from child star Natalie Wood (her role is relatively minor and she only features in a handful of scenes).  The supporting cast includes George Sanders, Edna Best, Vanessa Brown, Anna Lee, Isobel Elsom, and Robert Coote.(Single-sided, dual-layer disc).",4,bewitching romance,1180310400,"05 28, 2007",2007,1924,"['GHOST', 'AND', 'MRS', 'MUIR', 'top-flight', 'romantic', 'story', 'where', 'leads', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'kiss', 'more', 'later.Young', 'widow', 'Lucy', 'Muir', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'up', 'little', 'daughter', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'windswept', 'English', 'coast', 'love', 'first', 'abandoned', 'mansion', 'overlooking', 'sea', 'again', 'mysterious', 'occupant', 'Captain', 'Daniel', 'Gregg', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'ghost.Despite', 'obvious', 'differences', 'Daniel', 'Lucy', 'enough', 'help', 'write', 'memoirs', 'money', 'will', 'help', 'Lucy', 'stay', 'mansion', 'having', 'bother', 'tiresome', 'in-laws', 'way', 'special', 'friendship', 'blossoms', 'love', 'could', 'ghost', 'mortal', 'ever', 'find', 'common', 'ground', 'happiness', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'deliver', 'gentle', 'performances', 'very', 'singular', 'love', 'story', 'based', 'bestselling', 'novel', 'R.A.', 'Dick', 'Tierney', 'especially', 'grand', 'here', 'rare', 'departure', 'noir', 'dramas', 'had', 'catapulted', 'super-stardom.THE', 'GHOST', 'AND', 'MRS', 'MUIR', 'was', 'filmed', '1947', 'period', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'private', 'life', 'when', 'was', 'much', 'emotional', 'strain', 'marriage', 'fashion', 'designer', 'Oleg', 'Cassini', 'was', 'beginning', 'unravel', 'young', 'daughter', 'Daria', 'was', 'institutionalised', 'due', 'severe', 'physical', 'mental', 'disabilities', 'sustained', 'pregnancy', 'when', 'Tierney', 'came', 'contact', 'fan', 'who', 'was', 'sick', 'German', 'Measles', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'happening', 'private', 'life', 'performance', 'Lucy', 'Muir', 'so', 'delicate', 'nuanced', 'simply', 'perfection', 'Everyone', 'love', 'including', 'audience', 'Tierney', 'costumes', 'here', 'were', 'designed', 'Cassini', '.The', 'film', 'also', 'early', 'performance', 'child', 'star', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'role', 'relatively', 'minor', 'only', 'handful', 'scenes', 'supporting', 'cast', 'George', 'Sanders', 'Edna', 'Best', 'Vanessa', 'Brown', 'Anna', 'Lee', 'Isobel', 'Elsom', 'Robert', 'Coote', 'Single-sided', 'dual-layer', 'disc']",N/A

As another critic so masterfully captioned earlier, the true beauty of GAMM is that its romance is fully realized, courted, and even consummated without its two protagonists ever having physical contact. How *can* they, when one of them is flesh and the other isn't. But they do court- first in genteel, witty, one-upmanship banter between the sexes, then in gradual, verbal revelations of their most private and personal thoughts, all the while realizing that their individual stubborness and fire is exactly what attracts them to one another. (Listen especially to passages like Lucy describing her late husband- but not with much affection, or the Captain first talking about his rite of passage with an older woman.) Every time they speak they truly enjoy each other's company (the conversation on the train is especially fine) and there is an unspoken yearn to take their friendship to the next level. When Lucy finally utters the sad line ""what's to become of us,"" you realize that their relationship can never really materialize. The later epilogue, where an older Lucy tries to remember the Captain for her teenage daughter- and the daughter's revelation that she knew about him too- is at once lovely and bittersweet.

256648,A23DFB8IUTIZM0,6301586042,Dan Sherman,"[59, 61]","This is a wonderful romantic fantasy that tells the story of young widow (beautiful Gene Tierney)who moves into the seaside house of the late Captain Gregg (played with bluster by Rex Harrison). The captain first tries to scare the widow away, but soon they team up so that she can stay at the house. They both fall in love with the other, but neither can express their love to the other. The ghost leaves Mrs. Muir (and blots her memory of him), but they are ultimatley reunited in a very touching scene at the end of the film with her death. The film has a wonderfully atmospheric score by Bernard Herrmann (I believe it was his favorite) and a great performance by the caddish George Sanders. This charming film is a most definite buy!The DVD has a very sharp, crisp printing of the films with excellent sound - the commentaries that accompany the film are very good and informative, providing a lot of informaiton on how the film was shot and also how Herrmann scored the film.

256649,ASQ8KNNP3A7FP,6301586042,"Danusha V. Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[4, 6]","THIS REVIEW REVEALS SPOILERS ABOUT THE PLOT. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW HOW THE PLOT DEVELOPS, DON'T READ THIS REVIEWI saw ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" years ago on television. I was just a kid and I noticed, mostly, the high concept romance: A spunky, living, twentieth-century woman is in love with a pre-feminist, sea captain ghost. I enjoyed the film's wit and romance, but then I filed it and forgot about it, thinking of it as a clever concept, but not a classic.Because my own reaction to the film was rather shallow and cliched, I thought that the film itself was rather shallow and cliched, that it was just about its obvious wit and romance, with nothing deeper there.I recently rewatched the film. I saw the same amusing, stylish, witty, clever, high-concept romance -- living woman loves ghost -- that I had seen for the first time as a child. But there is a whole 'nother movie here beneath the surface style, a movie of great depth.As soon as the score began, while the Fox logo was still onscreen, I was all atremble, as if bewitched, with goosebumps and near tears. That score brought home to me the story and its attendant feelings of profound yearning and mystery.Perhaps I had registered all this when I had seen it as a child, but not consciously.Ken Geist, who offers commentary on the DVD version, said this about the score:""I can't really say enough about it ... it's haunting; it's the most haunting thing about this ghost picture and he brings to it the same quality of his haunting movie with Hitchcock, 'Vertigo.' I think that Bernard Hermann is a great film composer, from 'Citizen Kane' right through to 'Taxi Driver' and this may be his finest...it's wildly romantic.""There is the feminist subtext. Significantly, the film is set in early twentieth century England, the place and time of sufragettes. Women were breaking new ground. Lucy Muir, the lead here, breaks new ground by leaving her in-laws, living alone, and making her own living.Charles Lang's black and white cinematography is perfection, and it serves the story's various elements: its spookiness, romance, and humor, in turn -- perfectly.Rex Harrison is a revelation. Yes, this is a romance; it's not great literature. And yet, like great literature, it takes on big, universal themes: the passage of time, mortality, yearning, the complexities of love, the limitations of the legendary loves.Harrison's performance serves these themes in this frame perfectly. His Captain Daniel Gregg is a bit of a cartoon, but beneath the cartoon's exaggerations, you sense a real living, breathing, man, a boy who ran away from home and went to sea; his adopted mother yearning for him as his living lover would yearn for him once he died.I can't think of any other actor who could have performed this role with the utter perfection, the combination of intelligence, conviction, generosity, focus and flair that Harrison gave it.Gene Tierney is incredibly beautiful and that makes her believable as the target of the captain's yearning. she doesn't work 100% for me, though. She is perfect in ""Laura"" as the beautiful blank screen on which men project their fantasies; she's also perfect in ""Razor's Edge"" as a schemer.I never see Tierney connect with the women in her audience, though. I don't sense that she's up there doing what she's doing for *me,* and the rest of the women in the audience, as I do with other female stars, from Garbo to Jane Fonda.I would have liked to have seen Olivia de Havilland in the Lucy Muir part. She has that impossible combination of incredible, Fairy Queen beauty, plus human warmth and spunk so necessary in a romantic heroine.Too, Natalie Wood as Anna Muir is woefully underused. Did director Joseph Mankiewicz not realize what a goldmine of charm and talent Wood was? A scene where Lucy and Anna perform their mother-daughter bond would have added depth to the film.When i saw the film the first time, I had found George Sanders as Uncle Neddy / Miles Fairley to be a shallow snake in the grass and operator.Viewing it this time, though, I see that Miles is as human as Lucy and Daniel, with his own tragic incapabilities. Daniel can't be a real -- flesh and blood -- man; Miles can't be a real -- stand up -- man. Sanders' eloquent face, half supercilious, half tragic -- renders Miles' failed manhood poignant and tragic.Just as Daniel and Lucy yearn for what they can't have -- a flesh and blood romance -- Miles yearns for some impossible romance he can't have, and so he chases women by moonlight, and abandons them in the day.""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" highlights gender differences in love. Lucy Muir yearns for a man most women would love to meet -- a manly, strong, competent leader of men who is also dedicated to her, hangs on her every word, helps her around the house -- he even helps her with her in-laws.In helping Lucy, Daniel is not belittling her; he leads her to become her best self. He rescues her financially, but, in that rescue, he reinforces her own strengths, strengths she had not been aware of before him. Finally, he sacrifices himself utterly for her, going so far as to remove her memory of him in order that she can live a happy life without him.What a man. Does he exist? If he did, he'd have a very long waiting list of women trying to get to him. This man may not be just a fantasy in the movie; this man may be a fantasy in life, as well.This film poses the question: Is there such a thing as a soulmate? Someone you are destined to meet, no matter what intervenes between you and that person? Does love transcend death?",5,"Deeper, Richer, and More Complex Than Its High Concept Romance Suggests",1183161600,"06 30, 2007",2007,5572,"['THIS', 'REVIEW', 'REVEALS', 'SPOILERS', 'THE', 'PLOT',

It has a combination of humor and melancholy that make for a great and nearly unique romantic film.  I watch it at least twice a year.  Currently I am using a reasonably good Sony upscaling blu ray DVD player and a recent vintage 53 inch Sony LCD TV.  I watched the blue ray version once through and then several more times with the various commentary tracks.  I then compared the blu ray with a number of scenes on the studio classics standard DVD release.  Both looked very, very good.  The blu ray may have slightly clearer background detail and the sound may be a bit cleaner, but it was very difficult to distinguish the two on my system (which is reasonably well calibrated).  My conclusion is that for most people if one owned the studio classic standard DVD release the incremental quality one got from the blu ray is probably not worth the money.  My observations might have been different with a larger screen.  Both the Standard DVD and the blu ray are beautiful -- the superb, subtle Charles Lang cinematography shines through in both versions.

256665,A19U5RYULZ0Z72,6301586042,Douglas M,"[3, 3]","""The Ghost and Mrs Muir"" is the magical story of a widow, Lucy Muir, who rents a house by the sea and falls in love with the ghost of the former owner, a sea captain. The widow is played by Gene Tierney in possibly her best performance. For so much of her career, she was badly miscast but this is one film where her ladylike reserve is perfectly matched to the character she portrays. She is tender and haunting and particularly good as the middle aged Lucy Muir. Rex Harrison creates a robust, blustering and romantic Captain Gregg so they make a wonderful team. The house, the sea and above all, the memorable score, contribute to the magic.  The theme of unrequited love resonates.The film has generated much analysis over the years as a prototype of successful studio film making and an early example of the skill of its director. The DVD contains 2 commentaries with 2 commentators sharing duties on each track. The first is excellent focusing on the superb Bernard Hermann score and the technical aspects of the film. The second is more controversial. Janine Basinger falls into her usual trap of telling us what is happening on the screen as we watch. She states the obvious far too often. She shares duties with the obnoxious Kenneth Geist, author of, among others, a book on the director Joseph Mankiewicz. Geist clearly does not like the film. He notes that Mankiewicz fought with the screenwriter Philip Dunne who wrote the film as a timely romance with comic overtones. Mankiewicz wanted to make a Lubitsch like comedy and the matter was brought to Darryl Zanuck who backed Dunne. The fact that the film succeeds so admirably as a romance and has stood the test of time seems irrelevant to Geist! Geist is condescending about Tierney and ironically likes best the scenes with George Sanders, scenes in which Mankiewicz apparantly rewrote the dialogue. These are the scenes without Rex Harrison so Geist is in isolation because it is the relationship between Harrison and Tierney which gives the film its unique and timeless quality and not the much more conventional scenes with Sanders playing his tyepcast cad. Geist also suggests that the presence of Natalie Wood as Mrs Muir's daughter serves only to mark the passage of time in the film. He completely misses the point that Mrs Muir is a mother as well as a widow; hence her role as a responsible woman and not a frivolous flirt, particularly relevant in her relationship with Sanders.The DVD print is good but not perfect which is surprising given the status of the film. There is an episode of Biography, always an interesting program, on Rex Harrison, stills from the sets and other promotional material.

She decides it is time to leave and find a house by the sea, where she will take her houselady, Martha, and raise her daughter, Anna, played by Natalie Wood. They will live on the stipend her husband left her from a modest investment.The realtor, Mr. Coombe, shows her listings while skipping over one. Mrs. Muir decides to read it, and insists on seeing the house against Mr. Coombe's persistent objections. The house is perfect even though, it turns out, it is haunted. ""How perfectly fascinating"" she tells Mr. Coombe.Undaunted and unhaunted, Lucy Muir confronts the materialized sea Captain Greg, who quickly develops a fondness for her. When her mother-in-law and sister-in-law reappear (remember they're still alive) it is to inform her that her source of income has disappeared. (Sorry). They will take her, her daughter, and house lady back to London with them. The impatient captain, whom Lucy now calls Daniel and only visible to the one he fondly calls Lucia, quickly ushers the two women out. Not to worry, he says, she will write his story of life at sea, and that will keep her financial affairs from drifting on the rocks of pauperism.The publisher is not the only one she meets in London. The other is a handsome smoothie played by George Sanders who captures Lucy's attention and very soon after, her affections to the dismay of her daughter, housemaid, and the sea captain who sees right through the man's character.The captain visits Mrs. Muir one last time in her dreams to tell her that he will not interfere with her love. When she awakens, he assures a dreaming Lucia, she will not remember anything about him--ever.It is years later, and her grown daughter visits with her fiance. Over tea they discuss the past. Did mum ever dream about Captain Greg as she had, she asks? She tells her mother how she remembers dreaming about him and falling in love with him. The look on Lucy's face tells her daughter that she knew the Captain in her dreams too. Lucy dismisses the notion. ""How could we both have the same dreams,"" Anna asks. Lucy Muir tries, but cannot quite remember.The rest would be telling you the end, but I guarantee you that you will never forget this story as long as you live.Perhaps you will remember it even after that.",5,A Very Pleasant Ghost From the Past,1224979200,"10 26, 2008",2008,2743,"['one', 'thing', 'know', 'are', 'sit', 'down', 'view', 'something', 'truly', 'entertaining', 'Ghost', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', 'right', 'atmosphere', 'rain-pelted', 'windows', 'storm-swept', 'maples', 'window', 'provided', 'just', 'that.Gene', 'Tierney', 'shares', 'title', 'role', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', 'who', 'recently', 'widowed', 'not', 'so', 'beloved', 'Edwin', 'naturally', 'who', 'been', 'living', 'daughter', 'prying', 'eyes', 'domineering', 'nature', 'mother-in-law', 'sister-in-law', 'time', 'leave', 'find', 'house', 'sea', 'where', 'will', 'take', 'houselady', 'Martha', 'raise', 'daughter', 'Anna', 'played', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'will', 'live', 'stipend', 'husband', 'left', 'modest', 'investment.The', 'realtor', 'Mr.', 'Coombe', 'listings', 'skipping', 'one', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', 'read', 'insists', 'seeing', 'house', 'Mr.', 'Coombe', 'persistent', 'objections', 'house', 'perfect', 'even', 'out', 'haunted', 'How', 'perfectly', 'fascinating', 'Mr.', 'Coombe.Undaunted', 'unhaunted', 'Lucy', 'Muir', 'materialized', 'sea', 'Captain', 'Greg', 'who', 'quickly', 'fondness', 'When', 'mother-in-law', 'sister-in-law', 'reappear', 'remember', ""'re"", 'still', 'alive', 'inform', 'source', 'income', 'disappeared', 'Sorry', 'will', 'take', 'her', 'daughter', 'house', 'lady', 'back', 'London', 'impatient', 'captain', 'whom', 'Lucy', 'now', 'Daniel', 'only', 'visible', 'one', 'fondly', 'Lucia', 'quickly', 'two', 'women', 'out', 'Not', 'worry', 'will', 'write', 'story', 'life', 'sea', 'will', 'keep', 'financial', 'affairs', 'drifting', 'rocks', 'pauperism.The', 'publisher', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'London', 'other', 'handsome', 'smoothie', 'played', 'George', 'Sanders', 'who', 'Lucy', 'attention', 'very', 'soon', 'affections', 'dismay', 'daughter', 'housemaid', 'sea', 'captain', 'who', 'right', 'man', 'character.The', 'captain', 'visits', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'dreams', 'tell', 'will', 'not', 'interfere', 'love', 'When', 'dreaming', 'Lucia', 'will', 'not', 'remember', 'anything', 'ever.It', 'years', 'later', 'grown', 'daughter', 'visits', 'fiance', 'tea', 'discuss', 'past', 'Did', 'mum', 'ever', 'dream', 'Captain', 'Greg', 'had', 'mother', 'how', 'dreaming', 'falling', 'love', 'look', 'Lucy', 'face', 'daughter', 'knew', 'Captain', 'dreams', 'too', 'Lucy', 'notion', 'How', 'could', 'have', 'same', 'dreams', 'Anna', 'Lucy', 'Muir', 'tries', 'can', 'not', 'quite', 'remember.The', 'rest', 'would', 'be', 'telling', 'end', 'guarantee', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'story', 'as', 'long', 'live.Perhaps', 'will', 'remember', 'even']",N/A

There's a real beauty to both the scenery and story, and, as one reviewer said quite aptly, this is Gene Tierney's best achievement and finest role as the headstrong and independent Mrs. Muir. The lavish Victorian setting and the backdrop of the sea near the cottage makes for beautiful cinematography and creates perfect mood. The story is also quite interesting, as it is a not-so-typical romance between an earthly widow and the ghost of a sea captain. Refusing to be scared off by the ghost of Captain Gregg (Rex Harrison), Lucy Muir is determined to be the cottage's newest resident. Soon the two get to know each other and their stories, and become quite fascinated with each other.What makes The Ghost and Mrs. Muir a wonderful film is not only the exceptional performances turned in by Gene Tierney and Rex Harrison, but also director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's ability to create a ghost and love story with a little bit of humor. One can watch the beginning portions of the film and be reminded of the traditional ghost tale such as Rebecca, but then the film also explores the dimension and possibilities of love, even seemingly impossible love. There's also some wit and light-humor, with Gregg being sarcastic and humorously cynical to the earthly world, yet charming in other ways. There are some great exchanges between him and Mrs. Muir, with both characters being strong, and holding their own.The Ghost and Mrs. Muir is easily one of the best romances of all time, if not one of the top films of all time.",5,True Romance,1325894400,"01 7, 2012",2012,1597,"['Ghost', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', 'romantic', 'classic', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'real', 'beauty', 'scenery', 'story', 'one', 'reviewer', 'said', 'quite', 'aptly', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'best', 'achievement', 'finest', 'role', 'headstrong', 'independent', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', 'lavish', 'Victorian', 'setting', 'backdrop', 'sea', 'cottage', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'creates', 'perfect', 'mood', 'story', 'also', 'quite', 'interesting', 'not-so-typical', 'romance', 'earthly', 'widow', 'ghost', 'sea', 'captain', 'Refusing', 'be', 'scared', 'off', 'ghost', 'Captain', 'Gregg', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'Lucy', 'Muir', 'determined', 'be', 'cottage', 'newest', 'resident', 'two', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'stories', 'become', 'quite', 'fascinated', 'Ghost', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', 'wonderful', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'exceptional', 'performances', 'turned', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'also', 'director', 'Joseph', 'L.', 'Mankiewicz', 'ability', 'create', 'ghost', 'love', 'story', 'little', 'bit', 'humor', 'One', 'can', 'watch', 'beginning', 'portions', 'film', 'be', 'reminded', 'traditional', 'ghost', 'tale', 'such', 'Rebecca', 'then', 'film', 'also', 'dimension', 'possibilities', 'love', 'even', 'seemingly', 'impossible', 'love', 'also', 'wit', 'light-humor', 'Gregg', 'being', 'sarcastic', 'humorously', 'cynical', 'earthly', 'world', 'yet', 'charming', 'other', 'ways', 'are', 'great', 'exchanges', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', 'characters', 'being', 'strong', 'holding', 'own.The', 'Ghost', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'romances', 'time', 'not', 'one', 'top', 'films', 'time']",N/A

256681,A10F5LMYPXQYDF,6301586042,grerp,"[14, 36]","For a romantic comedy, The Ghost and Mrs. Muir has a decidedly melancholy feel to it, especially toward the end.  The movie starts better with determined widow, Lucy Muir (Gene Tierney), leaving her mother-in-law's house in search of some independence.  She arrives in remote Whitecliff-by-the-Sea with her daughter, Anna, servant, Martha, and a small income from a gold mine.  Given her financial situation, a certain cottage appeals most to her, but the estate agent is surprisingly reluctant to show it to her.  Turns out, it's haunted, and he can't keep a tenant in it.  Lucy stubbornly decides it's exactly what she needs and insists on moving in.  Immediately the haunting begins.  The ghost, a certain handsome sea captain (Rex Harrison), has decided not to share his house with anyone.  But Lucy stands up to him, and he decides he likes her so she can stay.  Unfortunately, very soon after Lucy's gold mine peters out, and she is left without an income.  But Captain Gregg decides to help her; they will write a book together - his biography, Blood and Swash.  He will narrate, and she will type it.  Rather predictably, Lucy finds a publisher on her first attempt, and the book is a success.  She now has enough money to stay in the house and has acquired a writer admirer - of whom Captain Gregg doesn't approve - in the process.  Now Lucy must decide whom she will love, her ghostly captain or her all-too-human writer friend, Miles Fairley (George Sanders).The Ghost and Mrs. Muir is a rather long film, 100 minutes in all, for such a straightforward story.  The first half is the most enjoyable as Lucy and Captain Gregg meet, squabble, and fall in love.  Though he is only ethereal, they have palpable chemistry.  Some of their dialogue is quite funny too (the best line being when she orders him to ""decompose"" instead of ""dematerialize"").  Though Captain Gregg is brusque and a bit misogynistic, he does like and respect Lucy and they have something in addition to attraction - true friendship.  He is aware, however, that Lucy needs more than just a ghost friend, and urges her to get out socially.When the love triangle emerges, the film goes downhill.  George Sanders, so interesting and perversely appealing in All About Eve, has a one-note character to play here - the too smooth writer on the make.  Had his part been more ambiguous, it would have packed more emotion into the film.  As it is, everyone but Lucy sees through him immediately, making her character seem rather stupid and the late plot conflict a bit meaningless.SPOILERS HERE:Sensing that she wants Fairley, Captain Gregg bows out of her life and (rather paternally) arranges for her to remember their time together as a dream.  But soon afterward, Lucy discovers for herself what a cad Fairley is and now must live her life without Fairley or Captain Gregg.  There are a couple of Time Passes segments in which Lucy ages rapidly until she is very old.  She then has a heart attack and Captain Gregg comes for her.  They step out of the house into the gleaming sunset.There are a number of very unsatisfying things about this ending.  First of all, Lucy appears to lead a purposeless life after Captain Gregg shoves off.  She does nothing creative, and seems to live on the revenue of Blood and Swash (how long exactly could that have generated a livable income?).  Ultimately, this means that Captain Gregg supported her for the rest of his life, as her husband did before that - Lucy is neither capable of supporting herself or of coming up with a meaningful vocation or charitable way of filling her days.  What a waste.Secondly, as Lucy sadly narrates to her daughter, she lived a 50-year lonely life.  The film, with its ""romantic"" ending suggests that her happiness could only come from being with a man - Captain Gregg.  But they only knew each other for a year, and she could barely remember him after he erased her memory of their time together.  She had much more time for a friendship with Martha, her servant, but Martha, loving and caring throughout the film, hardly rates a glance back from Lucy on her way out into the sunset with Captain Gregg.  If what Lucy and Captain Gregg had was True Love, perhaps this would be understandable.  But Lucy, when presented with the opportunity for human love with Miles Fairley, plunges in without giving Captain Gregg much of a thought.  This would suggest less than True Love.  Which makes the walk into the sunset just wrong.  Captain Dan deserves it, but Lucy does not.Besides the melancholy ""happy"" ending, the film has one more flow - as a ghost, Captain Gregg breaks all of the rules of specterhood.  He appears anywhere he likes - in the house and out of it, miles away.  He is not tied to location, and he's not even haunting for a real purpose.  He also decides to stop haunting the house of his own volition.  What kind a ghost comes and goes as he likes regardless of vocation.  Essentially he haunts Lucy whom he never knew before his death.  This allows him a great deal of freedom within the plot, but makes no sense at all.For all of these reasons, The Ghost and Mrs. Muir ultimately disappoints.  Lucy, Captain Gregg, and Miles Fairley are all handsome and well played, but in attempting to inject conflict and yet retain a sense of True Love the story's writers make Lucy into a silly, pointless woman undeserving of her ghostly lover.",3,"Problematic, especially in the second half",1175040000,"03 28, 2007",2007,5394,"['romantic', 'comedy', 'Ghost', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', 'decidedly', 'melancholy',

One would think, &quot;A romance between a woman and a ghost? How silly!&quot; Well, that kind of reasoning does not apply here. Joseph Mankiewicz, along with splendid performances by Tierney, Harrison, Sanders, along with the rest of the cast (including a very young Natalie Wood) achieve a very moving, touching story about loneliness and unrequited love. Miss Tierney, one of my favorite actresses, portrays Lucy Muir-a young widow of strong character who moves into a haunted cottage by the sea, and develops a friendship/romance with the cottage's ghostly former owner, Captain Gregg, played with great charm and gusto by Rex Harrison. This &quot;love that can never be&quot; will only reach fruition when Lucy dies. Captain Gregg, knowing this, decides to leave Lucy, leaving her with no memory of him. After a disastrous affair with a philandering author, played by George Sanders in one of his signature &quot;cad&quot; roles, Mrs. Muir resolves to live her life companionless-until her true love comes to claim her in death. Lucy grows old and finally dies, Captain Gregg returns for her, and the two walk off together into the mists of eternity. This film has a very quiet charm-it never bashes you over the head with pathos-it just works its way into your heart. Even its humor is very subtle-not the thigh-slapping kind, but far more subtle. Add to this lovely photography, and, of course, Bernard Herrmann's remarkable score. Herrmann proclaimed this score his personal favorite, even jokingly referring to it as &quot;my Max Steiner score&quot;. It is filled with great warmth and longing, and, even listening to it by itself without the images, brings tears to my eyes. It is very hard, in my opinion, to pull off romantic films without becoming maudlin and sappy. Happily, this gem of a film pulls it off beautifully.

Gene Tierney, who plays Lucy Muir, gives one of her best efforts (maybe second only to her tortured and torturing wife in LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN). Her remarkable physical beauty is matched by a warm spirit that is independent, yet fragile in it's need for love. Supporting roles by George Sanders as the cad who woos Lucy, and a very young Natalie Wood as her daughter, are all first rate.

256702,A3TZB9SXJCFMFJ,6301586042,J. Michael Click,"[192, 196]","Exquisite.  That one adjective describes both this film, and its leading lady.  Although she is best remembered as the title character in the classic 1944 mystery, ""Laura"", and received greater acclaim for her Oscar-nominated performance in the highest-grossing 20th Century-Fox film of the 1940's, ""Leave Her to Heaven"", ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" nonetheless remains Gene Tierney's most successful film performance.  As Lucy Muir, a spirited British widow at the turn of the 20th century who falls in love with the ghost of a sea captain, Miss Tierney is on screen in every scene of the film, and dazzles throughout with her ethereal beauty and her thespic versatility.  Afforded the rare opportunity to play moments of high comedy, quiet drama, and romantic yearning all in one film, Miss Tierney never once strikes a false note.  She is particularly touching in the sequence during which the middle-aged Mrs. Muir reflects on the past with her grown daughter; in the hands of a lesser actress, this scene could easily have become maudlin and overly sentimental, but Tierney plays it with a quiet dignity and sweet resolve that distills the essence of her graceful and independent character.Yet, while ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" is arguably Tierney's best film, its success is not due to her efforts alone.  Rex Harrison, in his second American film, also triumphs as the salty sea captain whose gruff veneer is slowly peeled away by the determined widow sharing his home.  The scene in which he bids her a tender farewell is brilliantly played.  George Sanders excels in his role as a romantic cad; the vocal sneer he practically patented on film suits his part here perfectly.  And the entire production is aided tremendously by Bernard Herrmann's lush and majestic score, as well as Charles Lang's Oscar-nominated cinematography (that nomination was for the 1947 awards, by the the way, not the 1942 ceremonies as incorrectly noted on the front of the DVD box).Speaking of the DVD, the transfer is - in the 20th Century-Fox Home Video tradition - disappointing.  While the source print is much better that the one used for the VHS and laserdisc releases, and is infinitely superior to the scratchy, poorly-spliced copy that is often screened on pay-TV stations like AMC, the film has not been digitally restored.  There are still significant flutters (especially noticeable during the opening credits), scratches, and jumps in both the picture and the soundtrack.  The DVD does include the rarely-seen Original Theatrical Trailer; a stills gallery that emphasizes set design photographs but does include some interesting on-the-set photos of Gene Tierney in her wheelchair (she broke her foot during production and continued filming against her doctor's advice); Theatrical Trailers for the five previously-released Fox Studio Classics DVDs; an A&E; ""Biography"" segment on Rex Harrison; and audio commentaries including remarks by film historian Jeanine Basinger who supervised the cataloging of the Tierney archives in Connecticut ... and whose name is misspelled on the DVD package.

MUIR qualifies for a secure spot in the top ten.  This tale of an impossible, yet enduring love is timeless, pure, and tender - a movie never to be forgotten, a movie to be watched again and again, especially with those you love.The story of THE GHOST AND MRS. MUIR is well known.  A young widow, Lucy Muir, her daughter, and their housekeeper, Martha, move into a spectacular seaside house.  The house is haunted by the previous owner, Captain Gregg, a curmudgeonly old sea captain who begrudgingly allows Mrs. Muir and her small family to stay.  Eventually, Mrs. Muir and the Captain fall in love.  However, Captain Gregg soon realizes that Mrs. Muir belongs in the world of the living, and he fades away, becoming only the memory of a dream.  However, true love is immortal and lasts forever...Gene Tierney is exquisite as Mrs. Muir.  Her performance is luminous; she is genuine, stunning, and wholly real.  Rex Harrison is wonderful as the grumpy old ghost of a sea captain.  The two have real chemistry, and the unfolding romance is sweet and touching.  The rest of this small cast, including a weasely George Sanders and a very young Natalie Wood, are all excellent in their respective roles; however, this film is all Tierney and Harrison.The black and white cinematography is amazing.  Robust and luminous, the play of shadow and the contrast of light and dark depict mood and tone in a manner not reproducible in color.  The score by Bernard Herrmann, whose music sets the stage for the films of Alfred Hitchcock, Orson Wells, and Ray Harryhausen, is one of his best, perfectly setting the mood for this melancholy romance.Experience this film with your family.  Adults will sigh and hug at the purity of true, unconsummated love, and children will appreciate the ghost story.  A treasured classic, THE GHOST AND MRS. MUIR is a film for the ages.

256716,AYPS4RCXEFSJP,6301586042,K. Boullosa,"[2, 2]","On any list of the Ten Most Romantic Films Ever Made, ""The Ghost and Mrs Muir"" will likely always be present. This beautiful 1947 black and white film by Joseph Mankiewiecz, with a gorgeous score by Bernard Herrmann (better known for the foreboding ones he did for Alfred Hitchcock), and marvellous performances by Gene Tierney and Rex Harrison, represents the best of post-War British romanticism.  It can only be described as - well, haunting.  Once seen, never forgotten, and pull out your handkerchiefs, you will need at least two.Gene Tierney plays Lucy Muir, an exquisite young widow with a little girl who moves to the seashore to get away from her late husband's domineering sister and mother.  Lucy's financial resources are limited, but she happens onto a house overlooking the sea that is surprisingly affordable - it appears the house has had trouble remaining occupied, due to ""disturbances"".  Lucy and her daughter fall in love with the house and move in, accompanied by Martha, their housekeeper.  Shortly afterward, Lucy is confronted by the source of the house's disturbances: its former owner, one Captain Gregg, a seaman who died in the house, and still considers it his.  He has chased out all subsequent owners and intends to do the same with Lucy, but she stands up to him defiantly, and lets him know that she will NOT be leaving and he can do as likes. He admires her spirit, and, having glimpsed her beauty (Ms. Tierney was surely at her most radiant in this film), he softens and agrees to share the house with her and her little family, although she asks him to refrain from contact with her little girl.  Captain Gregg is played by Rex Harrison at his most attractive, giving the role an irrisistible blend of charm, irony, and crustiness.A bantering but affectionate friendship develops between Lucy and Captain Gregg's ghost.  The Captain has clearly fallen for the new owner of the house, so much so that when Lucy's slender funds begin to run low and she confronts the possibility of losing the house she has come to love as much as he, Gregg dictates his very salty memoirs to her - they are published and become a best seller, ensuring Lucy's future.However, Captain Gregg eventually realizes that his presence in Lucy's life is preventing her from going out and meeting living men. Reluctantly, he decides to withdraw, and does so in a way that leaves Lucy no memory of Gregg's ""reality"", but rather a memory of an imaginary character that she dreamed and who then inspired the book.  After Gregg disappears, Lucy begins to go out into society, and almost immediately meets George Sanders - an experienced cad with whom she falls in love, only to find that he is married with several children.  The heartbroken Lucy retreats into solitude and decides that the only companionship she needs is her growing daughter, the loyal Martha, and the beloved house by the sea.Years pass, and Lucy's daughter grows up and becomes engaged to (naturally) a naval officer - when her daughter brings her fiance home, Lucy finds out that the little girl knew all about Captain Gregg and had frequent contact with him - something they both hid from Lucy.  More years pass, and now it is Lucy's granddaughter who is engaged to (naturally) a naval officer. Lucy and Martha have grown old together in the house, and, on a windswept night, the white-haired, tired Lucy passes quietly away in the great armchair in the Captain's old room - he suddenly appears before her and holds out his hands, and she springs up, young and beautiful again, and the two pass silently out into the briny night, finally able to live out the love they could not share while one of them still walked among the living.It sounds terribly soppy, but the script is of such high quality, the performances so note-perfect, the production so atmospheric, that the film never wanders into over-sentimentalization or saccharinity.  Its gentle romanticism recalls a lost era (alas, even Britain no longer makes films like this!) and, once seen, leaves an indelible memory.A five-star classic, and a must-have for fans of post-War British filmmaking of this genre.",5,"One of a Kind, Exquisite and Perfect",1204156800,"02 28, 2008",2008,4146,"['list', 'Ten', 'Most', 'Romantic', 'Films', 'Ever', 'Made', 'Ghost', 'Mrs', 'Muir', 'will', 'likely', 'always', 'be', 'present', 'beautiful', '1947', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'Joseph', 'Mankiewiecz', 'gorgeous', 'score', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann', 'better', 'known', 'foreboding', 'ones', 'did', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'marvellous', 'performances', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'best', 'post-War', 'British', 'romanticism', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'well', 'haunting', 'Once', 'seen', 'never', 'forgotten', 'pull', 'out', 'handkerchiefs', 'will', 'need', 'least', 'two.Gene', 'Tierney', 'Lucy', 'Muir', 'exquisite', 'young', 'widow', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'seashore', 'get', 'away', 'late', 'husband', 'domineering', 'sister', 'mother', 'Lucy', 'financial', 'resources', 'are', 'limited', 'house', 'overlooking', 'sea', 'surprisingly', 'affordable', 'house', 'had', 'trouble', 'remaining', 'occupied', 'due', 'disturbances', 'Lucy', 'daughter', 'fall', 'love', 'house', 'move', 'accompanied', 'Martha', 'housekeeper', 'Shortly', 'afterward', 'Lucy', 'confronted', 'source', 'house', 'disturbances', 'former', 'owner', 'one', 'Captain', 'Gregg', 'seaman', 'who', 'died', 'house', 'still', 'considers', 'chased', 'out', 'subsequent', 'owners', 'do', 'same', 'Lucy', 'up', 'defiantly', 'know', 'will', 'NOT', 'be', 'leaving', 'can', 'do', 'likes', 'spirit', 'having', 'glimpsed', 'beauty', 'Ms.', 'Tierney', 'was', 'surely', 'most', 'radiant', 'film', 'share', 'house', 'little', 'family', 'refrain', 'contact', 'little', 'girl', 'Captain', 'Gregg', 'played', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'most', 'attractive', 'giving', 'role', 'irrisistible', 'blend', 'charm', 'irony', 'crustiness.A', 'bantering', 'affectionate', 'friendship', 'Lucy', 'Captain', 'Gregg', 'ghost', 'Captain', 'clearly', 'fallen', 'new', 'owner', 'house', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'Lucy', 'slender', 'funds', 'begin', 'run', 'low', 'possibility', 'losing', 'house', 'come', 'love', 'as', 'much', 'Gregg', 'very', 'salty', 'memoirs', 'are', 'published', 'become', 'best', 'seller', 'ensuring', 'Lucy', 'future.However', 'Captain', 'Gregg', 'eventually', 'presence', 'Lucy', 'life', 'preventing', 'going', 'out', 'meeting', 'living', 'men', 'Reluctantly', 'withdraw', 'so', 'way', 'Lucy', 'memory', 'Gregg', 'reality', 'rather', 'memory', 'imaginary', 'character', 'dreamed', 'who', 'then', 'inspired', 'book', 'Gregg', 'disappears', 'Lucy', 'go', 'out', 'society', 'almost', 'immediately', 'meets', 'George', 'Sanders', 'experienced', 'cad', 'whom', 'love', 'only', 'find', 'married', 'several', 'children', 'heartbroken', 'Lucy', 'retreats', 'solitude', 'only', 'companionship', 'growing', 'daughter', 'loyal', 'Martha', 'beloved', 'house', 'sea.Years', 'pass', 'Lucy', 'daughter', 'up', 'becomes', 'engaged', 'naturally', 'naval', 'officer', 'when', 'daughter', 'fiance', 'home', 'Lucy', 'out', 'little', 'girl', 'knew', 'Captain', 'Gregg', 'had', 'frequent', 'contact', 'something', 'hid', 'Lucy', 'More', 'years', 'pass', 'now', 'Lucy', 'granddaughter', 'who', 'engaged', 'naturally', 'naval', 'officer', 'Lucy', 'Martha', 'have', 'grown', 'old', 'together', 'house', 'windswept', 'night', 'white-haired', 'tired', 'Lucy', 'passes', 'quietly', 'away', 'great', 'armchair', 'Captain', 'old', 'room', 'suddenly', 'out', 'hands', 'up', 'young', 'beautiful', 'again', 'two', 'pass', 'silently', 'out', 'briny', 'night', 'finally', 'able', 'live', 'out', 'love', 'could', 'not', 'share', 'one', 'still', 'walked', 'living.It', 'terribly', 'soppy', 'script', 'such', 'high', 'quality', 'performances', 'so', 'note-perfect', 'production', 'so', 'atmospheric', 'film', 'never', 'over-sentimentalization', 'saccharinity', 'gentle', 'romanticism', 'lost', 'era', 'alas', 'even', 'Britain', 'no', 'longer', 'films', 'once', 'seen', 'indelible', 'memory.A', 'five-star', 'classic', 'must-have', 'fans', 'post-War', 'British', 'filmmaking', 'genre']",N/A

A determined young widow and her daughter decide to get away from it all, moving to a house by the sea. The house has been for sale for quite some time and the locals say it's haunted, which only seems to encourage her to move in...but the owner still has yet to move out. The sea captain, the man from a too-realistic painting in the house, resents that his accidental death was called a suicide and hence punishes all who try to live in his house, like his latest house guest the widow. But she's the proverbial different and nether widowing, a corset, or a ghost can hamper her. Eventually the captain and the widow forge a living together (he can stay if he won't bother the widows daughter), complete with .... tension, until a suitor moves in on Mrs. Muir and eventually the captain and his painting are taken down...Rex Harrison plays a less articulate version of the unapologetic, well, sadist that was Henry Higgins (of ""My Fair Lady""). The widow is smart but sensitive (and a lady, who covers up the captains painting before undressing) and likeable, who notices that neither she nor her daughter have no accent?

It doesn't even have to be a great movie for me to find something to appreciate...as long as it was filmed in the 1930s, or 40s. However, The Ghost and Mrs. Muir is different...it's a rare cinematic gem, even among the many true classics from this period. It's not just a ghost story, but an unforgettable tale of unrequited love. Gene Tierney plays the beautiful, but unworldly Lucy Muir, while Rex Harrison plays the crusty &quot;no longer of this world&quot; sea Captain, Daniel Gregg. Once the widow Muir moves into the home of the long dead captain, things really start getting lively. Gregg, unhappy about his home being invaded, sets out to haunt Lucy Muir and her little family until they decide to leave. However, the feisty and brave Lucy refuses to be either haunted, or intimidated. Daniel, moved by Mrs. Muirs strength of character, as well as her great beauty, both inward as well as outward, finally relents and allows Lucy, her daughter...played by a very young Natalie Wood...and faithful housekeeper Martha to stay. All goes well until Lucy discovers that the small income left by her husband is gone and she now faces ruin, not the least of which is the loss of Captain Gregg's home by the sea. To keep Lucy from losing everything, Daniel comes up with the idea of writing a book...&quot;ghost written&quot; by him, but with all the credit going to Lucy. The book is published and is wildly successful, however, during the writing the two have fallen hopelessly in love. It's only when Daniel sees Lucy with a man who is very much alive... and played to perfection by George Sanders...that he finally realizes that he must disappear so that Lucy can have the earthly relationship she needs and deserves. However, love, even with ones feet firmly planted on solid ground, is not always possible. The ending of the movie does reaffirm for us though, that as elusive as love may appear...as invisible as it may seem...it's around us all the time. The farewell to his beautiful &quot;Lucia&quot;, is one you will never forget and it's easy to understand why Harrison was called &quot;Sexy Rexy&quot; back in the 40s. He certainly was. There is real chemistry between Harrison and Tierney and the dialog is crisp and intelligent. The cinematography is a work of art and as for the soundtrack, it's Bernard Herrmann's finest...absolutely gorgeous.

Because &quot;The Ghost and Mrs. Muir&quot; captures a fear we sometimes have,--&quot;What if there is a person just right for me, but we never meet in this life?&quot;  and then puts a spin on it--&quot;Well, suppose you could, if there were such a thing as a ghost!&quot; Captain Gregg has only been dead for four years when Mrs. Edwin Muir (Gene Tierney) rents his Gull Cottage, so they have only just missed each other temporally. Yet they forge a relationship, at first rusty as he must adjust to her settling in, then companionable as her collapsed finances force them to collaborate on his memoirs, then -- but what else can there be, since he's only a ghost? The attraction for me here is Captain Gregg's longing for what he can never have, having to remind Mrs. Muir ever so gently of the sad truth of their predicament: She, &quot;What's to become of us, Daniel, of you and me?&quot;  He: &quot;Nothing can become of me. Everything's happened, that can happen.&quot;  What a lonely, tragic thought, and the brooding, hard to grasp score by Bernard Hermann helps carry the mood of a strange dream of which we can remember only snatches when we unwillingly awake. Captain Gregg eventually realizes he must relinquish his love to live her life among the living, even though he doubts a happy outcome to her infatuation with a suave gentleman author, Miles Fairley (George Sanders). But love is about sacrifice sometimes, and even a ghost can feel pain but do the right thing. Everything about &quot;The Ghost and Mrs. Muir&quot; fits together beautifully: the score, as mentioned before; the set of Gull Cottage, built in tasteful nautical style; the costumes designed by Oleg Cassini, then married to Gene Tierney; and the actors, competent and evocative.

Gene Tierney is a young widow who moves into a sea side resort only to discover that it is haunted by the ghost of a sea captain.  The romance that blossoms between the two is enchanting.The same can't be said for the transfer quality.  While the black and white picture has been well balanced in contrast levels, the picture throughout is plagued with aliasing, shimmering and edge enhancement that make for a wholly unsatisfying visual experience.  There are even several cases where splice cuts are evident in a sudden flicker or jump as the image changes from scene to scene.  The sound, though remixed to stereo, is unremarkable and characteristically mono with the exception of its music track.  We get no &quot;making-of&quot; that has accompanied previous Fox Studio Classics in the series - a lost opportunity.  Instead there's a biography on Rex Harrison that is short and glossy but ultimately limited in its critique of this great intercontinental actor.

The side story with Mr. Fairley was about as transparent as it could get.  The music was good.

She chooses a seaside cottage, although she is warned not to take it, and when she visits the residence she finds out why she has been cautioned - the place is haunted by a grumpy sea captain, Daniel Gregg (Rex Harrison), who very much wants things his own way. Despite her delicate femininity, Lucy refuses to let Gregg intimidate her, and moves in. Their relationship, at first a bickering one, becomes one of mutual interest and it blossoms as Lucy (whom Gregg christens Luchia) finds that she is bankrupt and can't afford the house, so helps her write a novel based on his seafaring adventures. As they fall in love, it becomes very complicated, as he is a ghost and she is among the living, and when George Sanders' untrustworthy rake comes into Lucy's life, Gregg makes the painful decision to leave and tells Lucy as she slumbers that it was all a dream - she wrote the book, she dreamed him up, although there is regret as he takes one last longing look at her. Lucy resumes her life, having completely forgotten about Daniel, only to discover that her flesh and blood suitor has a wife and children, and Anna Lee shines brightly in her small role of Sanders' long-suffering but understanding wife.As time passes, Lucy every now and then has a tinge of remembrance, but it's not until her now grown daughter (played by Vanessa Brown) comes home for a visit and talks of a handsome sea captain who engaged her in conversation when she was a little girl . . . . . . . .Although she again dismisses it as a dream, Lucy appears to be serenely at peace, and time passes and she becomes elderly, she dies in her sleep in her favorite chair, only to be greeted by Daniel, who extends his hand to her, and her young and vibrant spirit exits the cottage with him . . . . .I can't think of a lovelier ending for this movie, or a better revelation that young Anna also made Gregg's acquaintance. Bernard Herrman's score, somewhat echoing some of his work for Hitchcock, fits the story beautifully. You can't help but love Daniel's references to his monkey puzzle tree, and the sense of humor when he advises Lucy to tell her in-laws to ""shove off!"". Everything in the film echoes the influence of the ocean and its romantic associations - even the surname of ""Muir"" is symbolic, since translated from Gaelic it means the sea. I don't think that was a coincidence, and the fact that Gene Tierney was of Irish descent makes this film all the more perfect . . . . . . . . .Into the sea of love divine, where it is no longer a dream . . . . . .",5,Love Can Transcend Death,1141171200,"03 1, 2006",2006,2835,"['gloriously', 'charming', 'romantic', 'comedy/fantasy', 'should', 'be', 'shared', 'everyone.Gene', 'Tierney', 'tender', 'performance', 'widow', 'Lucy', 'Muir', 'who', 'leave', 'home', 'stifling', 'controlling', 'in-laws', 'make', 'new', 'life', 'herself', 'young', 'daughter', 'Anna', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'seaside', 'cottage', 'warned', 'not', 'take', 'when', 'residence', 'out', 'why', 'been', 'cautioned', 'place', 'haunted', 'grumpy', 'sea', 'captain', 'Daniel', 'Gregg', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'who', 'very', 'much', 'things', 'own', 'way', 'delicate', 'femininity', 'Lucy', 'let', 'Gregg', 'intimidate', 'moves', 'relationship', 'first', 'bickering', 'one', 'one', 'mutual', 'interest', 'Lucy', 'whom', 'Gregg', 'Luchia', 'bankrupt', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'house', 'so', 'write', 'novel', 'based', 'seafaring', 'adventures', 'fall', 'love', 'very', 'complicated', 'ghost', 'living', 'when', 'George', 'Sanders', 'untrustworthy', 'rake', 'Lucy', 'life', 'Gregg', 'painful', 'decision', 'leave', 'tells', 'Lucy', 'was', 'dream', 'wrote', 'book', 'dreamed', 'up', 'regret', 'one', 'last', 'longing', 'look', 'Lucy', 'life', 'having', 'completely', 'forgotten', 'Daniel', 'only', 'discover', 'flesh', 'blood', 'suitor', 'wife', 'children', 'Anna', 'Lee', 'brightly', 'small', 'role', 'Sanders', 'long-suffering', 'understanding', 'wife.As', 'time', 'passes', 'Lucy', 'now', 'then', 'tinge', 'remembrance', 'not', 'now', 'grown', 'daughter', 'played', 'Vanessa', 'Brown', 'home', 'visit', 'talks', 'handsome', 'sea', 'captain', 'who', 'engaged', 'conversation', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'girl', 'again', 'dream', 'Lucy', 'be', 'serenely', 'peace', 'time', 'passes', 'elderly', 'sleep', 'favorite', 'chair', 'only', 'be', 'greeted', 'Daniel', 'who', 'hand', 'young', 'vibrant', 'spirit', 'cottage', '.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'lovelier', 'ending', 'movie', 'better', 'revelation', 'young', 'Anna', 'also', 'made', 'Gregg', 'acquaintance', 'Bernard', 'Herrman', 'score', 'somewhat', 'echoing', 'work', 'Hitchcock', 'story', 'beautifully', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'Daniel', 'references', 'monkey', 'puzzle', 'tree', 'sense', 'humor', 'when', 'Lucy', 'tell', 'in-laws', 'shove', 'off', 'Everything', 'film', 'influence', 'ocean', 'romantic', 'associations', 'even', 'surname', 'Muir', 'symbolic', 'translated', 'Gaelic', 'sea', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'coincidence', 'fact', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'was', 'Irish', 'descent', 'film', 'more', 'perfect', 'sea', 'love', 'divine', 'where', 'no', 'longer', 'dream']",N/A

Mankiewicz, 1947)While I was a longtime fan of the TV adaptation of The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, which ran only two seasons but survived for years afterwards in syndication, I somehow never got round to seeing the film version until now. I'm not sure why. It's a Mankiewicz (Sleuth, The Quiet American) film, so it's guaranteed entertainment, and the screenplay is by Philip Dunne (The Robe). Add a cast headed up by Gene Tierney and Rex Harrison, and how can you go wrong?Tierney plays Lucy Muir, a young widow who, after an amusing scene where she asserts herself with a realtor who thinks he knows what's best for her, rents a seaside cottage haunted by the ghost of its previous inhabitant, Captain Gregg (Harrison). Lucy, her daughter Anna (Natalie Wood), and her maid Martha (Enda Best), settle in and seem to be doing well until Lucy's mother-in-law and sister-in-law, two harridans if ever there were, drop in to inform her that her late husband's estate is gone. Lucy and Captain Gregg have to come up with a plan that will keep the house in Lucy's name, so that she can dispose of it in her will the way he would have in his, had he time to make one.On the surface, The Ghost and Mrs. Muir is nothing more than a charming, if shallow, romance with supernatural tinges. But there's surface, and then there's the film Joseph Mankiewicz made, which bears up to repeated viewings. The viewer will likely find some new subtle nuance or shade with each revisiting of the film; the symbolism runs fast and deep here, and there are all sorts of pleasurable little nuggets to be found for those willing to look. Not to say one can't enjoy it as nothing more than a charming, if shallow, romance; the beauty of Mankiewicz' movies is that no matter what you bring to the table, they're still a great experience. ****",4,Not your momma's romance film.,1219104000,"08 19, 2008",2008,1846,"['Ghost', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', 'Joseph', 'L.', 'Mankiewicz', '1947', 'was', 'longtime', 'fan', 'TV', 'adaptation', 'Ghost', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', 'ran', 'only', 'two', 'seasons', 'survived', 'years', 'afterwards', 'syndication', 'somehow', 'never', 'got', 'round', 'seeing', 'film', 'version', 'now', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'Mankiewicz', 'Sleuth', 'Quiet', 'American', 'film', 'guaranteed', 'entertainment', 'screenplay', 'Philip', 'Dunne', 'Robe', 'Add', 'cast', 'headed', 'up', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'how', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'Tierney', 'Lucy', 'Muir', 'young', 'widow', 'who', 'amusing', 'scene', 'where', 'realtor', 'who', 'what', 'best', 'seaside', 'cottage', 'haunted', 'ghost', 'previous', 'inhabitant', 'Captain', 'Gregg', 'Harrison', 'Lucy', 'daughter', 'Anna', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'maid', 'Martha', 'Enda', 'Best', 'settle', 'seem', 'be', 'doing', 'well', 'Lucy', 'mother-in-law', 'sister-in-law', 'two', 'harridans', 'ever', 'were', 'drop', 'inform', 'late', 'husband', 'estate', 'gone', 'Lucy', 'Captain', 'Gregg', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'plan', 'will', 'keep', 'house', 'Lucy', 'name', 'can', 'dispose', 'will', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'time', 'make', 'one.On', 'surface', 'Ghost', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', 'nothing', 'more', 'charming', 'shallow', 'romance', 'supernatural', 'tinges', 'surface', 'then', 'film', 'Joseph', 'Mankiewicz', 'made', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'viewer', 'will', 'likely', 'find', 'new', 'subtle', 'nuance', 'shade', 'revisiting', 'film', 'symbolism', 'fast', 'deep', 'here', 'are', 'sorts', 'pleasurable', 'little', 'nuggets', 'be', 'found', 'willing', 'look', 'Not', 'say', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'nothing', 'more', 'charming', 'shallow', 'romance', 'beauty', 'Mankiewicz', 'movies', 'matter', 'what', 'bring', 'table', ""'re"", 'still', 'great', 'experience', '****']",N/A

Dick) and screenplay by Philip Dunne, is the English Victorian tale of widowed Lucy Muir (Gene Tierney) and her young daughter Anna (Natalie Wood). Wood turns in a spirited performance as young Anna, although she is not given a great deal of screen time. Edna Best makes a charming companion for the isolated Lucy as her outspoken maid Martha. Lucy's meddling in-laws want to force Lucy and Anna to move to London, but Lucy is offended by their view that she is helpless and incapable of supporting herself and her daughter on her writing. Tierney brings a gravity to her role befitting the Victorian era, but tempers it with a playful, witty streak. Harrison is effective as the gruff sea captain with a heart of gold. The two strike up an amazing amount of chemistry despite the physical distance between the actors; instead, emotion is conveyed through glances and words.The two move to a cottage by the sea that's curiously affordable considering the great view, but Lucy soon finds out why. It's haunted by the ghost of Captain Daniel Gregg (Rex Harrison), a cantankerous old salt who's overly fond of swearing and frightening off prospective buyers. Lucy, however, is very forward and independent for her era and refuses to be forced out of her new home in Gull Cottage, so the two reach a kind of truce.Lucy and Daniel soon strike up a deep friendship bordering on romance, and Lucy, a writer, agrees to ghost write Capt Gregg's autobiography. During her meetings with the publisher, she is charmed by Miles Fairley (George Sanders), a famous children's author, and Daniel reluctantly lets Lucy pursue a flesh-and-blood suitor. The ending (much-copied) may be one of the most romantic on film, and clearly inspired later time-travel romanceSomewhere in Time (Collector's Edition).The film is marked by beautiful cinematography, particularly of the sea (filmed at Carmel-by-the-Sea, Monterey, and various other California coastal locations), and a lush, haunting score by Bernard Herrmann (The Ghost And Mrs. Muir: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) that may be one of the most poetic film scores ever along with John Barry'sSomewhere In Time (1998 Re-recording).The DVD thankfully features many fine extras, such as commentaries by film historian Gregg Kimble and Bernard Herrmann expert Christopher Husted, commentary by chairman of film studies at Wesleyan University Jeanine Bassinger and Kenneth Geist (biographer of Joseph L. Mackiewicz), A&E; Biography:""Rex Harrison: The Man Who Would Be King,"" the original theatrical trailer, and a still gallery.

The recently widowed Mrs. Muir takes leave of the bustling city for a short stay at the coast of England.  She rents a grand, seaside cottage that has a history of very short tenancies.  The reason?  The house, of course, is haunted by Captain Gregg, who resents anyone living in 'his' house.Shot in gorgeous and lush black and white, in Carmel, California, the film is long on romance and melancholy.  The headstrong Lucy Muir refuses to be put off by the blunt and brusk Captain.  They forge a true friendship, maturing into an impossible love that can withstand the passing of a lifetime.  Captain Gregg helps her through some tough financial times, giving Mrs. Muir a lifetime income and allows her to purchase the cottage.  Gregg realizes that he must leave Lucy while she is still young, and has a long lifetime of living to do.  But things don't work out as she hopes, and she is left with the now lonely cottage, unhaunted but lacking in companionship.  Mrs. Muir turns her back on the world, excepting her daughter, and then her granddaughter.One thing that does bother me about the plot is that the Captain disappears for years, leaving her lonely and without male companionship.

""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" is the rarest of films, one which reveals that while our deepest human aspirations may be spun from the same stuff that dreams are made of, such dreams are what give us our depth, our dignity, and our truest reality as individuals.""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir,"" like all true art, is a perfect fusion of fantasy and reality.  Lucy Muir, as portrayed by the luminous Gene Tierney, is one of cinemas' most enchanting characters.  Ordinary in manner she radiates an exotic beauty at once ethereal and down to earth.  An independent spirit who longs to transcend the stifling conventions of Victorian England, Mrs. Muir never quite manages to find what she is looking for within the confines of her social milieu.  Her relationship with her daughter and her maid are enduring, but true love eludes her.  Only with the spirit of a seaman named captain Greg who haunts her cottage does Lucy find true companionship.  In the person of Rex Harrison, captain Greg is at once blustery and tender.  Harrison's performance embodies virile masculinity, humor, and compassion.  He is, in short, Lucy's ideal man.  Too bad he is only a ghost, a figment of her imagination, a dream.  But he helps her write her book, he sustains her spirit, and encourages her growth in ways no one else can.  He is, of course, a jealous ghost, and when Lucy finds a flesh and blood man in the person of Miles Fairley as played by George Sanders, he departs.  Sanders, with his mellifluous baritone and smarmy charm is tailor made to play the debonair cad that sweeps Lucy off her feet only to leave her in the lurch.The entire cast is superlative, but the chemistry between Tierney and Harrison is something even a notch above that.  Every aspect of this film is satisfying from Charles Lang's breathtaking cinematography (Oscar nominated) to Bernard Herman's haunting score.  Fox has included a wealth of bonus materials that make this DVD an even better way to experience this wonderful movie.  There are two informative film commentaries, six theatrical trailers (which include the trailer for ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir), a forty-five minute documentary of the life of Rex Harrison, and numerous production stills, photos, lobby cards, and posters.  The film print itself is pristine and nearly flawless, displaying superb contrast in rich detail.

But watch what happens and you'll totally be drawn in.  After Lucy Muir moves with her young daughter and trusted servant to a seaside cottage, she discovers that it's haunted.  However, she is so in love with the house - it suits her in a way she can't define - that she can't stand the thought of leaving.  After the ghost, a sea captain named Daniel, fails to scare her away, they reach an agreement to live amicably with one another.The conversations between the two are initially hilarious, but gain a strong emotional dimension as the prim Victorian woman and coarse sea captain get to know each other better.  Their connection becomes so powerful, you almost forget at times that the captain is a spirit.  However, as right as they are for one another, there is still that physical barrier between the living and the fleshless.  What's also interesting about the film is its psychology.  Daniel is Lucy's ideal man - is he really a ghost, or just the product of her overactive imagination? Regardless of what you think the answer is, the question becomes increasingly important during the second half of the movie, when Lucy is pursued by a flesh-and-blood man, a suave and oily writer, who is certainly not her ideal but makes her commitment to the sea captain waver.As Lucy, Gene Tierney is wonderful - she is great in both the humorous scenes and the troubled, emotional ones.  She makes Lucy come alive as the proper, well-bred lady who also has a quirky side to her, and a resilience not found in many women of the time.  And Rex Harrison is marvelous as Daniel.  Though I first cracked up when hearing his gruff, earthy voice, he quickly won me over.

Once you step back in time into that prim, Victorian world it is hard to turn away. That's what makes for great movies.Gene Tierney is perfect in her role as Lucy, a young widow, very strong-willed and with a mind of her own. She decides to leave the home and relatives of her late husband to find a new life of independence for herself and her daughter. She is shown &#34;Gull Cottage&#34; by an agent and is determined to rent the seaside cottage although it's known to be haunted by the ghost of a sea captain.Eventually, once settled into her new surroundings, she is confronted by the apparition of Captain Daniel on a blustery stormy night. Their acquaintance does not get off to an easy start but he decides she can stay and won't trouble her with his houndings which would have ordinary people put to flight and making a hasty retreat. Her amusing exchanges with the captain, played by Rex Harrison, are a delight.When she develops an interest in a certain outsider, Miles Fairley, suitably performed by that perennial ladies' man, George Sanders, well the captain becomes very annoyed and tells her, &#34;I said you should see men, not perfumed parlor snakes,&#34; which I thought was amusing and a very apt description.I think the overall tone of the story tends to confirm a universal belief in an afterlife form of existence, a conviction as old as mankind itself. However, in this story the emphasis gradually shifts to supplanting the experience of a ghostly dialogue exchange with that of a dream state as being the source of reality, in effect Lucy dreamed it all, even the writing of the book, which is something I would question but that's another matter.The exquisite music throughout the film sets the mood beautifully in expressing the many changes varying from haunting, romantic atmosphere to frolicsome (when the captain is up to his pranks), as well as the churning turbulence of the majestic waves along the shore.I've recently acquired the DVD and appreciate having the subtitles now which brings out more details of the dialogue. This is a very special movie one doesn't easily forget, and so well done, pure artistry on film.",5,A Great Classic!!!,1393632000,"03 1, 2014",2014,2260,"['may', 'say', 'so', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'haunting', 'lovely', 'romances', 'ever', 'screen', 'ghost', 'step', 'back', 'time', 'prim', 'Victorian', 'world', 'hard', 'turn', 'away', 'what', 'great', 'movies.Gene', 'Tierney', 'perfect', 'role', 'Lucy', 'young', 'widow', 'very', 'strong-willed', 'mind', 'own', 'leave', 'home', 'relatives', 'late', 'husband', 'find', 'new', 'life', 'independence', 'herself', 'daughter', 'shown', '34', 'Gull', 'Cottage', '34', 'agent', 'determined', 'rent', 'seaside', 'cottage', 'known', 'be', 'haunted', 'ghost', 'sea', 'captain.Eventually', 'once', 'settled', 'new', 'surroundings', 'confronted', 'apparition', 'Captain', 'Daniel', 'blustery', 'stormy', 'night', 'acquaintance', 'not', 'get', 'off', 'easy', 'start', 'can', 'stay', 'wo', ""n't"", 'trouble', 'houndings', 'would', 'have', 'ordinary', 'people', 'put', 'flight', 'making', 'hasty', 'retreat', 'amusing', 'exchanges', 'captain', 'played', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'are', 'delight.When', 'interest', 'certain', 'outsider', 'Miles', 'Fairley', 'suitably', 'performed', 'perennial', 'ladies', 'man', 'George', 'Sanders', 'well', 'captain', 'very', 'annoyed', '34', 'said', 'should', 'see', 'men', 'not', 'perfumed', 'parlor', 'snakes', '34', 'thought', 'was', 'amusing', 'very', 'apt', 'description.I', 'think', 'overall', 'tone', 'story', 'confirm', 'universal', 'belief', 'afterlife', 'form', 'existence', 'conviction', 'as', 'old', 'mankind', 'However', 'story', 'emphasis', 'gradually', 'supplanting', 'experience', 'ghostly', 'dialogue', 'exchange', 'dream', 'state', 'being', 'source', 'reality', 'effect', 'Lucy', 'dreamed', 'even', 'writing', 'book', 'something', 'would', 'question', 'matter.The', 'exquisite', 'music', 'film', 'mood', 'beautifully', 'expressing', 'many', 'changes', 'varying', 'haunting', 'romantic', 'atmosphere', 'frolicsome', 'when', 'captain', 'up', 'pranks', 'as', 'well', 'churning', 'turbulence', 'majestic', 'waves', 'shore.I', ""'ve"", 'recently', 'acquired', 'DVD', 'appreciate', 'having', 'subtitles', 'now', 'out', 'more', 'details', 'dialogue', 'very', 'special', 'movie', 'one', ""n't"", 'easily', 'forget', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'pure', 'artistry', 'film']",N/A

256806,AMB2Z4FMDBWQY,6301586042,"VIDFAN ""specfellow""","[1, 1]","While it is often remembered as a romantic drama, the underlying themes of a woman's yearning for independence and the pain of loneliness are to me as poignant as the love affair between Rex Harrison and Gene Tierney. She starts off a widow determined to live her own life after having been stifled by her husband and his meddling family. She defies the sexist attitude of the real estate agent who reluctantly lets her buy Gull Cottage, and she has a showdown with Rex Harrison repeatedly over his attitude toward women. Much of the film's charm comes out of their combative natures and how they learn to compromise, respect, and love each other's hunger for freedom. While the captain expressed this existential desire through his lifestyle (chronicled by Mrs. Muir later in a book), she is equally adamant to build a new life for herself and date cads like George Sanders, who represent danger and recklessness to her.What's sad is that, while the captain fulfilled most of his desires in his lifetime (he sailed the seas, he had tons of women, he lived a hearty life that even the sheltered male publisher is awed by), Mrs. Muir will never experience that same freedom and independence he had. She gets to live his life vicariously by writing the book, but the sadness of the film lies in the fact that she is doomed to stand eternally on the ""widow's walk"" and gaze into the distance, waiting for her ghost/husband to make his way home. Her one try at living the kind of reckless, bohemian lifestyle she envied of the captain (making out with the secretly married George Sanders) ends in defeat and heartbreak. She is the one who ends up living most of her life alone.The Bernard Hermann score and the beautiful shots of the ocean all echo this theme of solitude and yet the peace to found in contemplating the eternal, as represented by the sea. The ending always makes me cry not just because the Ghost and Mrs. Muir are finally reunited in love, but in the fact that, in death, Mrs. Muir never has to be that lonely, ever again.",5,Poignant and Moving - Independence & Loneliness Are Major Themes,1358985600,"01 24, 2013",2013,2036,"['often', 'remembered', 'romantic', 'drama', 'underlying', 'themes', 'woman', 'yearning', 'independence', 'pain', 'loneliness', 'are', 'as', 'poignant', 'love', 'affair', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'widow', 'determined', 'live', 'own', 'life', 'having', 'been', 'stifled', 'husband', 'meddling', 'family', 'sexist', 'attitude', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'who', 'reluctantly', 'buy', 'Gull', 'Cottage', 'showdown', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'repeatedly', 'attitude', 'women', 'Much', 'film', 'charm', 'combative', 'natures', 'how', 'learn', 'compromise', 'respect', 'love', 'other', 'hunger', 'freedom', 'captain', 'expressed', 'existential', 'desire', 'lifestyle', 'chronicled', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', 'later', 'book', 'equally', 'adamant', 'build', 'new', 'life', 'herself', 'date', 'cads', 'George', 'Sanders', 'who', 'represent', 'danger', 'recklessness', 'her.What', 'sad', 'captain', 'fulfilled', 'most', 'desires', 'lifetime', 'sailed', 'seas', 'had', 'tons', 'women', 'lived', 'hearty', 'life', 'even', 'sheltered', 'male', 'publisher', 'awed', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', 'will', 'never', 'experience', 'same', 'freedom', 'independence', 'had', 'live', 'life', 'vicariously', 'writing', 'book', 'sadness', 'film', 'fact', 'doomed', 'stand', 'eternally', 'widow', 'walk', 'gaze', 'distance', 'waiting', 'ghost/husband', 'make', 'way', 'home', 'one', 'try', 'living', 'kind', 'reckless', 'bohemian', 'lifestyle', 'envied', 'captain', 'making', 'out', 'secretly', 'married', 'George', 'Sanders', 'defeat', 'heartbreak', 'one', 'who', 'up', 'living', 'most', 'life', 'alone.The', 'Bernard', 'Hermann', 'score', 'beautiful', 'shots', 'ocean', 'echo', 'theme', 'solitude', 'yet', 'peace', 'found', 'contemplating', 'eternal', 'represented', 'sea', 'ending', 'always', 'cry', 'not', 'just', 'Ghost', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', 'are', 'finally', 'reunited', 'love', 'fact', 'death', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', 'never', 'be', 'lonely', 'ever', 'again']",N/A

It's about the inevitability of death -- and how one can waste one's life waiting for it. The ending is a model of classic Romanticism -- the lovers, who never had a physical relationship, are eternally united in death.R A Dick's (Josephine Leslie's) novel is good, and Philip Dunne's outstanding script is even better, a model of adaptation. He removes what isn't absolutely necessary, and emphasizes the story's morbid sentimentality. Aspiring screenwriters should note that almost every scene is driven by strong character conflict.Little need be said about Bernard Herrmann's score, his personal favorite, and one of the greatest ever written. Herrmann doesn't shy away from the mixture of fear and longing surrounding death, and isn't afraid to lay it bare. Without his music, it would be a shallower and less-affecting film.The transfer is excellent. There are a few spots here and there, and a jitter or two, but the beautiful cinematography comes through. This is a prime candidate for restoration (though little is needed) and a Blu-ray edition. (I have learned there will be a Blu-ray arriving in 12/2013. Thank you, Fox.)One of the greatest romantic films, ever.
