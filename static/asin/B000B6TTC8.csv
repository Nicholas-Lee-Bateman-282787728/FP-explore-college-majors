936897,AO7RFXGXSY3LN,B000B6TTC8,"Amy Wallace ""Buttonsamy""","[32, 34]","Season 3 of CSI Miami really turned up the heat this season as we watch Horatio Caine and his team solve a slough of exciting crimes. In this season, Hortatio comes off as more of a superhero; every third episode or so he is running from an exploding building, narrowly escaping from some natural disaster like a tsunami or hurricane, dodging bullets and still managing to look fabulous with his designer sunglasses. Not that I am complaining, the action and excitement is packed into each episode.Season 3 continues the story about Horatio's brother, Raymond, who is not dead, as told in the season 2 finale, we see more of Susie and Ray's daughter, Madison, and one of the CSI's dies in the first few episodes. Are you hooked yet? I certainly was after watching just one episode. Another great episode is about everyone's favorite coroner and Eric Delco being trapped AGAIN in the forrest preserve in a flash fire, deja vu all over again!1. Lost Son: A boat plows into a drawbride and one car falls into the waters below. One of the CSI team gets fatally shot in a shootout.2. Pro Per: Someone opens fire at party guests at a luxury mansion on the beach. The only witness who saw the shooter is a young boy who saw his mother get shot.3. Under the Influence: A beautiful woman falls under a bus and mysterious circumstances surround her death.4. Murder in a Flash: A flash mob of college students happens on a golf course, and after everyone has left a dead body is discovered in the sand trap.5. Legal: When a body is found in a very posh club (with very cool glass!) everyone is a suspect.6. Hell Night: A bus filled with jury members of a large murder case makes a stop at the defendant's house to look at the scene and someone ends up dead with only the jury as suspects.7. Crime Wave: A tidal wave hits the shores of Miami leaving a crime in its wake.8. Speed Kills: Speed dating clientel are supected in a mysterious death.9. Pirated: Pirates have apparently hit the coast of Miami after the bodies of a boat crew are found tied together in a chain in the ocean.10. After the Fall: A man falls to his death off a modern apartment building and Horatio is accused of being too violent with the suspect. Brutality charges are brought against him.11. Addiction: A beautiful young married couple drive off the road and the wife is killed. The husband claims they were being held up at gunpoint.12. Shootout: A shootout takes place in the emergency room between rival gang members.13. Cop Killer: A teenager is the only witness to a police officer's shooting and he has gone missing.14. One Night Stand: A hotel bellhop is shot when he opens a myserious suitcase and views its mysertious (and missing contents.15. Identity: A victim is found at a hotel covered in slime and two young women are implicated in a murder and they both claim to be victims of identity theft.16. Nothing to Lose: A fire and murder have occured in the Everglades again and Eric and Alex are caught once again in a sticky situation. Another body is found after the fires are put out.17. Money Plane: A dead body is found in a mail carrier plane's cargo that went down.18. Game Over: A car plows into a boat leaving the boat driver dead.19. Sex & Taxes: A man shoots a boat theif who attempts to shoot him, but there is more than meets the eye and Horatio knows it.20. Killer Date: A dating service madame winds up dead in a bar and her partner is business is suspected.21. Recoil: The ultimate Horatio Caine episode begins with a stakeout at the courthouse while police and CSI join forces to protect a woman being held at gunpoint.22. Vengeance: Someone ends up dead at a high school reunion and a life ensurance salesman is a suspect.23. Whacked: Crime analyst Valera is suspected of illegal evidence procedure and this could put a serial killar on the loose.24. 10-7: A wearhouse party explodes and the club owner is found dead and Raymond shows up again and his story is played out.This season was much better than the previous two. Hortatio Caine, played by David Caruso is the next super-hero, and his CSI team is his sidekick. Wtih more action, suspense and unusual crimes to solve, this season will keep viewers rivited to each episode.",5,Season 3 turns up the heat!,1126915200,"09 17, 2005",2005,4221,"['Season', '3', 'CSI', 'Miami', 'really', 'turned', 'up', 'heat', 'season', 'watch', 'Horatio', 'Caine', 'team', 'solve', 'slough', 'exciting', 'crimes', 'season', 'Hortatio', 'off', 'more', 'superhero', 'third', 'episode', 'so', 'running', 'exploding', 'building', 'narrowly', 'escaping', 'natural', 'disaster', 'tsunami', 'hurricane', 'dodging', 'bullets', 'still', 'managing', 'look', 'fabulous', 'designer', 'sunglasses', 'Not', 'am', 'complaining', 'action', 'excitement', 'packed', 'episode.Season', '3', 'story', 'Horatio', 'brother', 'Raymond', 'who', 'not', 'dead', 'told', 'season', '2', 'finale', 'see', 'more', 'Susie', 'Ray', 'daughter', 'Madison', 'one', 'CSI', 'dies', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'Are', 'hooked', 'yet', 'certainly', 'was', 'watching', 'just', 'one', 'episode', 'great', 'episode', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'coroner', 'Eric', 'Delco', 'being', 'trapped', 'AGAIN', 'forrest', 'preserve', 'flash', 'fire', 'deja', 'vu', 'all', 'over', 'again', '1', 'Lost', 'Son', 'boat', 'drawbride', 'one', 'car', 'waters', 'One', 'CSI', 'team', 'fatally', 'shot', 'shootout.2', 'Pro', 'Per', 'Someone', 'fire', 'party', 'guests', 'luxury', 'mansion', 'beach', 'only', 'witness', 'who', 'saw', 'shooter', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'saw', 'mother', 'get', 'shot.3', 'Influence', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'bus', 'mysterious', 'circumstances', 'surround', 'death.4', 'Murder', 'Flash', 'flash', 'mob', 'college', 'students', 'golf', 'course', 'everyone', 'left', 'dead', 'body', 'discovered', 'sand', 'trap.5', 'Legal', 'When', 'body', 'found', 'very', 'posh', 'club', 'very', 'cool', 'glass', 'everyone', 'suspect.6', 'Hell', 'Night', 'bus', 'filled', 'jury', 'members', 'large', 'murder', 'case', 'stop', 'defendant', 'house', 'look', 'scene', 'someone', 'up', 'dead', 'only', 'jury', 'suspects.7', 'Crime', 'Wave', 'tidal', 'wave', 'shores', 'Miami', 'leaving', 'crime', 'wake.8', 'Speed', 'Kills', 'Speed', 'dating', 'clientel', 'are', 'supected', 'mysterious', 'death.9', 'Pirated', 'Pirates', 'have', 'apparently', 'hit', 'coast', 'Miami', 'bodies', 'boat', 'crew', 'are', 'found', 'together', 'chain', 'ocean.10', 'Fall', 'man', 'death', 'modern', 'apartment', 'building', 'Horatio', 'accused', 'being', 'too', 'violent', 'suspect', 'Brutality', 'charges', 'are', 'brought', 'him.11', 'Addiction', 'beautiful', 'young', 'married', 'couple', 'drive', 'road', 'wife', 'killed', 'husband', 'claims', 'were', 'being', 'held', 'up', 'gunpoint.12', 'Shootout', 'shootout', 'place', 'emergency', 'room', 'rival', 'gang', 'members.13', 'Cop', 'Killer', 'teenager', 'only', 'witness', 'police', 'officer', 'shooting', 'gone', 'missing.14', 'One', 'Night', 'Stand', 'hotel', 'bellhop', 'shot', 'when', 'myserious', 'suitcase', 'mysertious', 'missing', 'contents.15', 'Identity', 'victim', 'found', 'hotel', 'covered', 'slime', 'two', 'young', 'women', 'are', 'implicated', 'murder', 'claim', 'be', 'victims', 'identity', 'theft.16', 'Nothing', 'Lose', 'fire', 'murder', 'have', 'occured', 'Everglades', 'again', 'Eric', 'Alex', 'are', 'caught', 'once', 'again', 'sticky', 'situation', 'body', 'found', 'fires', 'are', 'put', 'out.17', 'Money', 'Plane', 'dead', 'body', 'found', 'mail', 'carrier', 'plane', 'cargo', 'went', 'down.18', 'Game', 'car', 'boat', 'leaving', 'boat', 'driver', 'dead.19', 'Sex', 'Taxes', 'man', 'boat', 'theif', 'who', 'shoot', 'more', 'eye', 'Horatio', 'it.20', 'Killer', 'Date', 'dating', 'service', 'madame', 'up', 'dead', 'bar', 'partner', 'business', 'suspected.21', 'Recoil', 'ultimate', 'Horatio', 'Caine', 'episode', 'stakeout', 'courthouse', 'police', 'CSI', 'join', 'forces', 'protect', 'woman', 'being', 'held', 'gunpoint.22', 'Vengeance', 'Someone', 'up', 'dead', 'high', 'school', 'reunion', 'life', 'ensurance', 'salesman', 'suspect.23', 'Whacked', 'Crime', 'analyst', 'Valera', 'suspected', 'illegal', 'evidence', 'procedure', 'could', 'put', 'serial', 'killar', 'loose.24', '10-7', 'wearhouse', 'party', 'explodes', 'club', 'owner', 'found', 'dead', 'Raymond', 'shows', 'up', 'again', 'story', 'played', 'season', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'previous', 'two', 'Hortatio', 'Caine', 'played', 'David', 'Caruso', 'next', 'super-hero', 'CSI', 'team', 'sidekick', 'Wtih', 'more', 'action', 'suspense', 'unusual', 'crimes', 'solve', 'season', 'will', 'keep', 'viewers', 'rivited', 'episode']",CSI: MIAMI - COMPLETE THIRD SEASON

""Why"" he's alive is good, too.On DVD, these CSI-Miami episodes really shine (and more so on Blu-Ray, which is forthcoming) because of the fantastic, bright Florida colors.

Otherwise, the series had evolved both a successful formula and an effective visual style.  The formula, derived from the original CSI, involved one or two cases per episode, both decided primarily by the evidence. The cast had settled comfortably into their roles, although some of these remained undeveloped.  For the most part, the dialogue was designed to highlight David Caruso, who exudes a combination of virtue and professionalism.  The series could be gratuitously morbid.  Episodes like Crime Wave and Pirated go overboard in showing waterlogged bodies.  At times, the series could become a bit sanctimonious.  But apart from this, the scripts were well-written, with tight plotting.  After using a primarily episodic format, toward the end of the season the scripts began to incorporate longer story arcs, which led to the elimination of several minor characters.  The series' visual quality is one of its best elements.  The ocean and skies are shown in azure blue, while most of the exterior scenes in the city use orange and yellow shades.  In this respect, CSI Miami draws from the 1980s series Miami Vice, noted for its innovative color schemes.",3,Visual crime drama,1347321600,"09 11, 2012",2012,1276,"['third', 'season', 'CSI', 'Miami', 'began', 'very', 'much', 'same', 'vein', 'second', 'major', 'change', 'cast', 'Otherwise', 'series', 'had', 'evolved', 'successful', 'formula', 'effective', 'visual', 'style', 'formula', 'derived', 'original', 'CSI', 'involved', 'one', 'two', 'cases', 'episode', 'decided', 'primarily', 'evidence', 'cast', 'had', 'settled', 'comfortably', 'roles', 'remained', 'undeveloped', 'most', 'part', 'dialogue', 'was', 'designed', 'highlight', 'David', 'Caruso', 'who', 'combination', 'virtue', 'professionalism', 'series', 'could', 'be', 'gratuitously', 'morbid', 'Episodes', 'Crime', 'Wave', 'Pirated', 'go', 'overboard', 'showing', 'waterlogged', 'bodies', 'times', 'series', 'could', 'become', 'bit', 'sanctimonious', 'apart', 'scripts', 'were', 'well-written', 'tight', 'plotting', 'using', 'primarily', 'episodic', 'format', 'end', 'season', 'scripts', 'began', 'incorporate', 'longer', 'story', 'arcs', 'led', 'elimination', 'several', 'minor', 'characters', 'series', 'visual', 'quality', 'one', 'best', 'elements', 'ocean', 'skies', 'are', 'shown', 'azure', 'blue', 'most', 'exterior', 'scenes', 'city', 'use', 'orange', 'yellow', 'shades', 'respect', 'CSI', 'Miami', '1980s', 'series', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'noted', 'innovative', 'color', 'schemes']",CSI: MIAMI - COMPLETE THIRD SEASON

936916,A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL,B000B6TTC8,Little Miss Cutey,"[8, 11]","Admittedly, I don't love this as much the original CSI set in Las Vegas, but I don't like CSI New York and don't watch that at all.  I really like this cast (and in the first episode of this season we lose Tim Speedle (who I thought was pretty good in it - maybe a little dull but a nice guy).  That was a sad episode but his replacement Ryan Wolfe (who's so cute) does a good job in filling the void.  He's an ex cop and takes some time fitting in with the team.One thing you'll notice if you watch all three franchises is the colour they use for each show.  I find Miami is the most colourful.  Their lab is sleeker but the outdoor shots are stunning and use vibrant colours - often a lot of yellowy orangey tones (whereas New York is dull and blue and grey and Vegas is somewhere in the middle).There are 24 episodes in this season and I'm always impressed with how they keep it fresh and different.  Someday I'm expecting them to run out of ideas, but in the meantime it's always interesting and really keeps you guessing.  There is a little more personal looks into the lives of the CSI agents which you don't see in Vegas, and it's a nice mix.Overall, this is a great series but I do still prefer the original.

936917,A24MVVGNFVG68S,B000B6TTC8,Manfred Zeichmann,"[13, 14]","I am a great fan of CSI and while I love all both the original and the NY franchise, CSI MIAMI is my favorite of the shows. I like the Horatio CAINE character and am a huge fan of actor David CARUSO. CSI MIAMI also has the great advantage of  unusual diverse locations (the ocean, the Everglades, marinas, etc) which are great backdrops for exciting crime stories, while on the other hand in Vegas there is just desert and neon-lights and New York has been the setting of  too many movies and series to be ""fresh"". Besides, CSI MIAMI stars stunningly beautiful Southern Belle Emily PROCTER :)I finished the DVD box of season three a couple of days ago. It is great stuff that will appeal to all fans of the series. What I found particularly fascinating with season three is the effort and expenditure that went into it - you know, the episodes are more like condensed feature films for cinematic release. You have a plane crash (episode MONEY PLANE), a yacht ramming a bridge (LOST SON), a tsunami (CRIME WAVE), attacks with rocket propelled grenades (PIRATED), huge explosions (10-7, among others) etc  Really awesome! Okay, nitpickers will argue that the computer generated tidal wave in CRIME WAVE was not up to Hollywood blockbuster standard, but hey, it is a TV show! I have seen far worse computer effects.Season three managed to add more human depth to the characters and their development. There is the death of Speedle in the first episode (very touching, indeed), his replacement by ambitious cop Ryan WOLFE and the evolving rivalry between WOLFE and DELKO, Calleigh's father is still unable to quit the booze (detailed in the unfortunately rather weak episode UNDER THE INFLUENCE) and Horatio learns that his brother is still alive (more on that in the last episode of the series). Personally I miss the Speedle character and I think Ryan WOLFE is a weak replacement. With all due respect to the fans of the character and actor Jonathan TOGO, but I find this over-ambitious and eager guy more than annoying!Most of the episodes are great storywise, although there are some exceptions. For instance, the aforementioned episode UNDER THE INFLUENCE was quite predictable - from the moment it was established that Calleigh's father was involved in a car accident when driving drunk, I knew that the guy he run over was already dead long before the car hit him. Other more unremarkable episodes are MURDER IN A FLASH and ADDICTION.PIRATED is my favorite season three episode. The plot concerns weapon smuggling with a fishing boat, high sea piracy and political radicals, who use RPGs to terrorize Latino immigrants (while a subplot in the episode revolves around cannibalism among sailors adrift the ocean in their life raft). Plot and forensics are top notch, e.g. when residue from the exhaust fumes of a bazooka is found in the nose of a culprit it puts him on the crime scene. However I have issues with the ideology this particular episode promotes - it goes out of its way to promote multi-culturalism, a point which is re-iterated in some dialogues towards the end of the episode again and again. That said, PIRATED is great.Other great episodes are CRIME WAVE (although the heist plot - taking adavantage of a tsunami to rob a bank - is a bit too elaborated and complicated to be fully believeable) and SEX AND TAXES (concerning the violent deaths of not one but two revenue service agents). SEX AND TAXES also featured a forensic accountant finding essential clues to the crimes (being an accountant - albeit not a forensic one - myself, I simply love this episode).It needs to be pointed out that even weaker episodes usually have their merits like freak causes of death (for instance by paint ball gun in the HELL NIGHT episode or decapitation by shutter [ADDICTION]). I really admire the imagination of the script writers, when they come up with stuff like the aforementioned (or a drive-by shooting by boat in PRO PER.)  And suffice to say that the forensic stuff is hugely educational, well made and simply great!There is a host of extra features on disc 7. These include:* CSI MIAMI DEEP BLUE SEA - a very interesting featurette about underwater film shooting both in the ocean and in a fishtank.* Two making ofs (CSI MIAMI DELIVERING THE GOODS and VISUALIZING SEASON 3). You have the usual interviews with the actors, where they elaborate on their respective characters, but also hugely interesting stuff about the stuntwork in the series and memorable look inside the shooting of the vault scenes when the tsunami wave hits the bank in the CRIME WAVE episode.* An excellent 8 part featurette hosted by the series` consultant ( a real life coroner), which is an ultra fast paced crash course in forensic medicine ranging from autopsy proceedures to various causes of death (gun shot wound, blunt force trauma, asphyxation), illustrated with snippets from various episodes. Very interesting!* A brief documentary on the locations. While I knew that much of the series is actually shot in California I was not aware of the large extent. A location scout is being interviewed commenting on the difficulties finding convincing stand in locations. It is also depicted how sometimes CGI effects are used for greater authenticity (e.g. to remove hills in the background,  as Miami is completly flat)Despite some shortcomings a clear recommendation!
