The movie starts with the wedding of marriage counselor Mandy Moore and Kellan Lutz.  Things almost immediately degenerate in the married couples relationship as Mandy Moore's character psychotically tries to save her parents marriage from falling apart at any cost.  The problem is we don't have any back story outlining the relationships of either the main characters or their parents.  All we see is them NOT getting along.  Shouldn't we get to know them and care about them first?  It is not until the very end that you start to see any chemistry between the characters at all.  So, no character development until it is too late, the story starts off too late (we should have seen their relationships first before it falls apart) and overall poor execution of a great idea.

1443857,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00561BNI6,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[20, 25]","I've been a fan of actor Dermot Mulroney for over twenty years.  His laconic and naturalistic charm has oftentimes been the most interesting thing in his films--even if the movies themselves sometimes missed the mark.  The comedic romp ""Love, Wedding, Marriage"" is his feature film directorial debut (he is NOT in the movie) and, strangely, it lacks the ease and laid-back appeal that I've come to expect from him as an actor.  You'd think, at a minimum, he'd be able to coax terrific and funny performances out of his cast to make up for the script's shortcomings.  And you're not likely to encounter a larger compendium of TV sitcom cliches than those that comprise the movie's central plot.  Here everyone appears to be in a separate movie with key roles being bland, others overwrought, and others constantly bordering on a manic hysteria.  Maybe all this would be forgivable if the film aspired to real laughs as opposed to outrageous silliness.  You may disagree, but effective romantic comedies distinguish themselves when they are grounded in a truth and a reality.  They may be silly, but there's a real heart beating within.  ""Love, Wedding, Marriage,"" unfortunately, is so artificial--not a moment or an emotion ever rings true.Of course, in the movie, everyone is wildly attractive and wildly successful even though they act like they are junior high students.  The appealing Mandy Moore and Kellan Lutz play the central characters.  Their newlywed bliss is interrupted when her parents (Jane Seymour and James Brolin) separate due to a long-ago indiscretion.  Moore (who in movie-land is, of course, the world's least believable marriage counselor) channels so much energy into her parent's dilemma that it might derail her own happiness.  Slapstick antics ensue as both couples attend a relationship boot camp (poor Colleen Camp) and the elders hop around with another eccentric therapist (a wasted Christopher Lloyd).  The shenanigans of Moore become increasingly desperate, unpleasant, and unlawful as the movie continues to journey down avenues best left unexplored.  As this is what it is--you are never in doubt as to how things will turn out--there are just far too few laughs along the way.Here's the deal.  It's hard not to like the cast of ""Love, Wedding, Marriage"" despite the film's inconsistencies and flaws.  Brolin, in particular, seems to be getting a kick as the newly religious father.  But the film has the dramatic intensity of a second rate ""Three's Company"" episode minus the canned studio laughter.  A lot of talented people came together to make a perfectly ordinary and expected film.  If you are a fan of any of the leads, you might want to check this out.  Secondary performances by Jessica Szohr (Moore's sister) and Michael Weston (Lutz's best friend) have their moments.  But overall, everyone is performing to the rafters with over-the-top zeal to divert attention from the fact that the script offers little in the way of originality or noteworthy humor.  A disappointing misfire--and I was genuinely rooting for Mulroney!

It is no where near perfect, and is definitely one director's vision into a movie like this. The acting isn't great either, and sometimes Mandy can get to be too much.
