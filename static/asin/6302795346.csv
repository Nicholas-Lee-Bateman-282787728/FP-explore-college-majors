He then shows the audience the ""tricks of the trade"" as he and other charlatans travel America and bilk the bucks from the poor, the pathetic, and the undereducated. Things that you may have taken for granted while watching some of these preachers get into the act are shown in a new and revealing light to people who aren't already cynical of this kind of religion. Fortunately, Marjoe finds love and decides to give up the charade, as his conscience finally gets to him. Too bad more people didn't pay attention to this still-relevant flim back in 1972, perhaps there would have been no Jim Jones, PTL, Jimmy Swaggart scandals, etc. to help people see the light the HARD WAY!

Well, he went back to it after several years of sex, drugs and rock 'n roll, but with a difference. He took along a movie crew who recorded his explanations of how and why he did his preaching. He said he never had believed, not even as a little boy. His parents put him up to it, taught him like an actor on a stage, and lived well on the money he made.He explains the techniques of faith healing, relying heavily on the placebo effect. He explains about speaking in tongues, the hysteria of the crowd, and how he manipulated it. He shows how he got money out of the crowd. He explains his moves, including the fact that he was imitating Mick Jagger especially, but rock musicians more generally. And with his cynicism, he also exposes the cynical and greedy nature of the ministers who hired him to do revival meetings.He also filmed the back stage briefing he gave the film crew, explaining that they had to cut their hair, give up smoking, never date the girls in the congregation. If someone asks if you are saved, you say ""Yes!"" without hesitation and with eagerness, or they will try to win you over.I can't say I really enjoyed the movie. It is interesting and very revealing, but frankly all the Hallelujah and Jesus, Jesus, gets pretty darn tiresome after awhile. Also, it is disturbing to watch those faithful believers putting their money into the basket, and then watching Marjoe throw it on the hotel room bed and talk about how he got all that money as he smooths out the bills and stacks them up by denomination. It's supposed to make us feel better that he exposed the techniques of the fraud, but we can't help feeling sorry for the poor suckers that gave him their hard-earned cash.

There's so much of it in this film that the effectiveness of the whole is noticeably blunted.Note that this release of ""Marjoe"" is bundled with ""Thoth"" (you cannot buy them separately), a 40-minute video about a talented but pretentious NYC busker, a film that is about 35 minutes too long.

And indeed Marjoe, the antihero focus of this lame documentary, does reveal a couple tricks of the trade. Mostly, though, the movie makers throw away the very special opportunities they had to explore the topic in any depth. They seem so pleased with themselves for gaining access to three prayer meetings, they just let the cameras roll, never bothering to TALK to any of the Christians whom they apparently regard with a mixture of amusement and contempt. The result is very boring and very uninformative.Marjoe himself is a fascinating character, returning for a little more religious exploitation because that's the only way he has ever known how to make money. At the same time he's betraying the people he exploits, by bringing in the film crew, knowing that they're going to make a hostile documentary. He questions his own ethics briefly near the end, but in a facile, transient way. Any halfway decent interviewer would have explored his character in depth instead of just letting him shrug and change the subject.No one ends up looking good. Marjoe is a self-admitted charlatan. The documentary crew are smug, shallow, and not very smart. The preachers are opportunists (although we never find out how cynical they really are, because none of them is interviewed--not one). The congregations at the prayer meetings are seemingly uneducated and credulous, yet we can't be sure of that, either, because none of them is interviewed--not one.At least the members of the congregations believe in *something,* no matter how misguided it may be.

Both the subject & the filmmaker know that Marjoe's reasons are far from altruistic, and each is using the other for his own purposes.  The result is, at times, a rather surreal experience.  Marjoe is revealing himself, but in many ways he isn't.  We can never really be sure in what he believes, if anything.  I suspect it wasn't so much conscience as it was a practical business decision (the tent circuit had been slowly waning since the end of WWII, when the formerly-rural American population once and for all became urbanized)) as he recognized that there were more lucrative media in which he could utilize his talents.  Given his upbringing, not as a child but as a gimmick to be exploited, it would be amazing if he has a conscience at all.Did it make a difference?  Apparently not much of one, since Benny Hinn appears to be quite comfortably well-off.  People will believe what makes them feel most comfortable.

He also gave a shocking expose of just how far some so-called ministers will go to part people from their money.The result is this film.

""Marjoe"" is as deserving of the Oscar it received as any documentary I've ever seen. Marjoe, the boy, was raised to deliver and deliver he did. The early movies of his sermonizing are terrific and shocking. That he could actually perform weddings (also shown) is amazing.To Marjoe's credit, he allowed us a peek behind the wizard's curtain while in his late twenties. Having had a second awakening of sorts as to the fraud he was perpetrating, he shared it with a film crew in behind-the-scenes admissions. No sooner does the viewer learn the tricks of the trade then we see Marjoe out performing his shtick. The faux southern accent and perfect timing work like a charm as he seduces his audience minute by minute. Of course, there's always the appeal for money, which Marjoe gleefully counts out later, once with a colleague and once in his motel room. One of the best scenes is captured as he has dinner with a Texas family who supports him. He mentions other ""phony"" ministers and the adoring family concurs. All the while, Marjoe lets on not a peep about himself.This film draws on so many emotions it's hard to know where to draw the line. Toward the end of the film, Marjoe, himself, weighs in on his own morality. Is he bad or evil? In the end he declares himself to be simply ""bad"", thus delivering himself from any harsher judgment.

334856,AD5EHUXF0K57F,6302795346,K. D. Kelly,"[2, 2]","This is quite a beautiful film. It brings to mind the flawless Mayles' brothers 1969 documentary, ""Salesman.""""Marjoe"" is a character study and somewhat shocking expose, hinting at what in 1972 was the relatively new ""business"" of evangelism on a national scale -- hustlers peddling snakeskin oil for the spirit over airwaves and in the mailbox, Bible salesmen and evangelists being two peas in the same pod.Both ""Salesman"" and ""Marjoe"" -- named after the film's subject, Marjoe Gotner (the name ""Marjoe"" is a combination of Mary and Joseph, the parents of baby Jesus) -- cause the viewer to sympathize with the people being sold the product as well as the person selling it. And both are unflattering to their subjects.I think it goes without saying that had Marjoe's secret life -- in which he openly shares what he really thinks about religion -- been broken in today's climate, he would be hung out to dry in the press and possibly in court. But in the naive, Sodom-and-Gomorrah climate of the early 1970s, Marjoe went on to become a middling Hollywood star, his finest moment being a role in ""Bobbie Joe and The Outlaw,"" starring Lynda Carter in the only film in which she bared her breasts.If you thought Michael Jackson had it bad when he was a kid, well he did, but so did Marjoe, who was water-tortured and near-suffocated by both parents as punishment (they made a point of not harming him in any way that would leave physical marks, knowing he needed to appear regularly in public, as he was their meal ticket) and whose father flew the coop, absconding with as much as $3 million in tent-revival bucks, before Marjoe was 16.The filming of ""Marjoe"" took place during what Marjoe dubbed his final revival tour in 1971. Marjoe in the mid-1960s (in his early 20s) had taken up preaching again because he was broke. In front of the cameras between big-top gigs, Marjoe discusses the ambiguous guilt he feels for swindling God-fearing folks -- at times while counting the crumpled-up ones and fives he just collected!I was hoping the directors would more fully delve into the relationship between Marjoe and his dad, who at some point after Marjoe took up preaching on his own reconciled with his son. It might have helped to better understand Marjoe's state of mind; the childhood-abused, but dynamic and overconfident boy-preacher comes off somewhat two-dimensional (is his backstage life also an act?)As it is, the filmmakers spend a large amount of time on the revivals themselves, which very effectively places the viewer in the ""cauldron of creation,"" but at times becomes overwhelming. It's hard to deny after watching these scenes that Marjoe, who partly patterns his spiritual swagger after Mick Jagger, does have a gift for captivating a crowd.P.S.: If you sign up for Amazon Prime, for which the first 30 days are free, this is one of the free films it offers up in its instant streaming section.

334860,AK2BI1975MGFA,6302795346,Pauline Triage,"[4, 4]","""Marjoe"" won the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1972, and its star, Pentecostal preacher Marjoe Gortner, went onto to a decent career as a TV and b-movie villain in the 70's. At the time of its release the movie shocked and sobered people who'd long suspected, but couldn't prove, that revival-tent ministers are in fact a bunch of crooks. But eventually its notoriety faded and it languished in obscurity for decades. I myself had no knowledge of this movie although I grew up in the 1970s and remember Gortner well from his several guest appearances on TV shows like ""Kojak"". A few years ago Christopher Hitchens cited the film in his bestseller ""God is Not Great"" and a new audience of agnostics and young skeptics began seeking the film out online. While it's a good thing when a well-made documentary gains a new audience years after its release and its subject matter stands the test of time, the pacing and exposition of this movie will likely prove tough going for an internet audience whose attention span is sorely tried after about fifteen minutes. The bulk of this movie's hour and a half running time is spent in the revival tent, watching Marjoe preach to a succession of southern congregations. The fevered gyrating and ecstatic babbling of the congregants when Marjoe whips them into a religious frenzy stands in stark contrast to the scenes of Marjoe returning alone and weary to his hotel rooms to count his nightly cash haul and talk about his life. And it's quite a life, one he describes in scenes that are lucid and real and all too brief in contrast to the lengthy, loud sermon sequences.Marjoe Gortner was the first ""celebrity"" to invite a camera crew to document his life, and he did this because he was about to retire from the preaching circuit. Born into a family of preachers and named after the biblical Mary and Joseph, Marjoe began preaching - and serving as the primary breadwinner of his household - when he was four years old. Old films of him preaching and even performing a marriage ceremony as a child are clipped into the movie, and are now in fact widely available on Youtube. He confides in the movie's film crew that he hasn't been a believer for several years, but has returned to preaching because it's the only way he knows how to make a living. He describes attempting to leave the church as a teenager, and being taken in by ""an older woman"" who gave him the unconditional, parental love that his own parents had been unwilling to afford him. There's an implication that this relationship was sexual, in keeping with the theme of a young man whose life has been an apparent seesaw of exploiting and being exploited by the adults around him. It's also worth noting that deciding to expose himself as a fraud on film is actually a self-serving move on Marjoe's part - he admits that he's doing it to transition to an acting career.The most compelling moment of the revival meetings doesn't come from Marjoe, however, but from an unnamed pastor who invites Marjoe to speak to his congregation. As he introduces Marjoe, this pastor describes how, after many years of working at a series of backbreaking jobs, ""God rewarded me by giving me a Cadillac"". It speaks volumes about this man, this religion, and faith in general that this pastor somehow cannot even bring himself to take the rightful credit for working hard enough to afford a Cadillac, out of fear of offending God. Many people who viewed this scene found it funny; I found it heartbreaking, and Marjoe himself doesn't seem terribly amused either.The film crew finds the revival-tent crowd to be easy to make fun of, but to his credit Marjoe does display some genuine respect for the congregants, even as he's fleecing them for as much money as he can. He cautions the crew to tone down their hippyish appearance and be as polite and respectful as possible. In the movie's funniest moment he instructs them to greet any attempts on the part of the congregants to speak to them with a reference to ""being washed in the blood"", explaining, ""It's all about the blood. It's a bloody, gory thing, this religion."" Near the end of the film he defends revival meetings as being potentially beneficial to people, ""like group therapy, getting rid of your hangups"" but that it's ruined by ""having to add in all this holy window-dressing"". The movie never lets either Marjoe or the audience off the hook of moral ambivalence; as it closes, we get a glimpse of Marjoe's home life with his soft-spoken, secular girlfriend, and a final interview in which he self-assesses, ""I think I'm bad...but not evil.""If you liked 2006's ""Jesus Camp"", about the ministry of another charismatic preacher, Becky Fisher, you will probably enjoy this movie; in particular, young Levi, the homeschooled 12-year-old aspiring minister from that film, will evoke Marjoe's story in the viewer's mind.",3,Thumbs Up If Hitch Sent You,1332547200,"03 24, 2012",2012,4875,"['Marjoe', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Documentary', '1972', 'star', 'Pentecostal', 'Marjoe', 'Gortner', 'went', 'decent', 'career', 'TV', 'b-movie', 'villain', '70', 'time', 'release', 'movie', 'shocked', 'sobered', 'people', 'who', ""'d"", 'long', 'suspected', 'could', ""n't"", 'prove', 'revival-tent', 'ministers', 'are', 'fact', 'bunch', 'crooks', 'eventually', 'notoriety', 'faded', 'languished', 'obscurity', 'decades', 'had', 'knowledge', 'movie', 'grew', 'up', '1970s', 'remember', 'Gortner', 'well', 'several', 'guest', 'appearances', 'TV', 'shows', 'Kojak', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Christopher', 'Hitchens', 'cited', 'film', 'bestseller', 'God', 'Not', 'Great', 'new', 'audience', 'agnostics', 'young', 'skeptics', 'began', 'seeking', 'film', 'out', 'online', 'good', 'thing', 'when', 'well-made', 'documentary', 'gains', 'new', 'audience', 'years', 'release', 'subject', 'matter', 'test', 'time', 'pacing', 'exposition', 'movie', 'will', 'likely', 'prove', 'tough', 'going', 'internet', 'audience', 'attention', 'span', 'sorely', 'tried', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'bulk', 'movie', 'hour', 'half', 'running', 'time', 'spent', 'revival', 'tent', 'watching', 'Marjoe', 'preach', 'succession', 'southern', 'congregations', 'fevered', 'gyrating', 'ecstatic', 'babbling', 'congregants', 'when', 'Marjoe', 'religious', 'frenzy', 'stands', 'stark', 'contrast', 'scenes', 'Marjoe', 'returning', 'alone', 'weary', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'count', 'nightly', 'cash', 'haul', 'talk', 'life', 'quite', 'life', 'one', 'scenes', 'are', 'lucid', 'real', 'too', 'brief', 'contrast', 'lengthy', 'loud', 'sermon', 'sequences.Marjoe', 'Gortner', 'was', 'first', 'celebrity', 'invite', 'camera', 'crew', 'document', 'life', 'did', 'was', 'about', 'retire', 'preaching', 'circuit', 'Born', 'family', 'preachers', 'named', 'biblical', 'Mary', 'Joseph', 'Marjoe', 'began', 'preaching', 'serving', 'primary', 'breadwinner', 'household', 'when', 'was', 'four', 'years', 'old', 'Old', 'films', 'preaching', 'even', 'performing', 'marriage', 'ceremony', 'child', 'are', 'clipped', 'movie', 'are', 'now', 'fact', 'widely', 'available', 'Youtube', 'movie', 'film', 'crew', ""n't"", 'been', 'believer', 'several', 'years', 'returned', 'preaching', 'only', 'way', 'how', 'make', 'living', 'attempting', 'leave', 'church', 'teenager', 'being', 'taken', 'older', 'woman', 'who', 'gave', 'unconditional', 'parental', 'love', 'own', 'parents', 'had', 'been', 'unwilling', 'afford', 'implication', 'relationship', 'was', 'sexual', 'keeping', 'theme', 'young', 'man', 'life', 'been', 'apparent', 'seesaw', 'exploiting', 'being', 'exploited', 'adults', 'also', 'worth', 'noting', 'deciding', 'expose', 'fraud', 'film', 'actually', 'self-serving', 'move', 'Marjoe', 'part', 'doing', 'transition', 'acting', 'career.The', 'most', 'compelling', 'moment', 'revival', 'meetings', ""n't"", 'come', 'Marjoe', 'however', 'unnamed', 'pastor', 'who', 'Marjoe', 'speak', 'congregation', 'Marjoe', 'pastor', 'how', 'many', 'years', 'working', 'series', 'backbreaking', 'jobs', 'God', 'rewarded', 'giving', 'Cadillac', 'volumes', 'man', 'religion', 'faith', 'general', 'pastor', 'somehow', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'bring', 'take', 'rightful', 'credit', 'working', 'hard', 'enough', 'afford', 'Cadillac', 'fear', 'offending', 'God', 'Many', 'people', 'who', 'viewed', 'scene', 'found', 'found', 'heartbreaking', 'Marjoe', ""n't"", 'seem', 'terribly', 'amused', 'either.The', 'film', 'crew', 'revival-tent', 'crowd', 'be', 'easy', 'make', 'fun', 'credit', 'Marjoe', 'display', 'genuine', 'respect', 'congregants', 'even', 'fleecing', 'as', 'much', 'money', 'can', 'crew', 'tone', 'down', 'hippyish', 'appearance', 'be', 'polite', 'respectful', 'possible', 'movie', 'funniest', 'moment', 'greet', 'attempts', 'part', 'congregants', 'speak', 'reference', 'being', 'washed', 'blood', 'explaining', 'blood', 'bloody', 'gory', 'thing', 'religion', 'end', 'film', 'revival', 'meetings', 'being', 'potentially', 'beneficial', 'people', 'group', 'therapy', 'getting', 'rid', 'hangups', 'ruined', 'having', 'add', 'holy', 'window-dressing', 'movie', 'never', 'Marjoe', 'audience', 'hook', 'moral', 'ambivalence', 'get', 'glimpse', 'Marjoe', 'home', 'life', 'soft-spoken', 'secular', 'girlfriend', 'final', 'interview', 'think', ""'m"", 'bad', 'not', 'evil', 'liked', '2006', 'Jesus', 'Camp', 'ministry', 'charismatic', 'preacher', 'Becky', 'Fisher', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'particular', 'young', 'Levi', 'homeschooled', '12-year-old', 'aspiring', 'minister', 'film', 'will', 'evoke', 'Marjoe', 'story', 'viewer', 'mind']",N/A

Maybe it is because Steve Martin's underated ficticious film ""Leap of Faith"" told the story much better. Maybe because so many evangelists have been exposed as frauds it is barely noteworthy anymore. Mostly it is because I wanted to hear the filmmakers ask Marjoe some more probing questions. When the film ends all we know is he felt kind of bad for duping people and decided to stop doing it. Did he even believe in God? Does he think his actions will eventually be punished? Does he owe any restitution? We will never know unless an updated version of this film is released with commentary by Gortner. There are several scenes here where Gortner rightly whines that he was used and abused by his parents and pushed into this life of deceit. He never sees that he is practicing the same thing on his audiences. Another odd thing is that Gortner is seen laughing about the deceit he is practicing and the film crew cackles along with him. Did anyone feel any remorse about this? On the other hand the crowds that came to see Gortner probably deserved it, but that is another story. This is a 2 DVD set that includes another academy award winning documentary short called ""Thoth"". It is pretty interesting about a guy who creates his own pagan mythology and then sings one man operas about it in various places around New York City. The thing is if you happen to come across one of these performances you would be probably be blown away by this incredibly unique person.

334863,A3LPQAPU2ILDD0,6302795346,R. McRae,"[1, 5]","The film ""Marjoe"" is documented proof that Christians should heed the Bible warning to ""Try the spirits..."" 1John 4:1. We should also remember that for every gift of God, Satan surely has a counterfeit. Even though they have a Bible in hand, study for yourself, they may be misquoting it. Just because they ""speak-in-tongues"" doesn't mean it's the true gift of other languages, as was the case in Acts chapter 2, when Jews throughout the Middle East were gathered in Jerusalem to celebrate Pentecost. And they brought with them, the many different languages of those various lands. See Acts 2:4-11 for the Bible's own plain explanation of ""other"" tongues.The true gift of tongues are known languages throughout the world, not ""unknown"" as the King James unintentionally has led some to believe. The gift of tongues is simply the ability to speak or witness in a language that was previously ""unknown"" to the recipient. The word ""unknown"" is in italics throughout chapters 12-14 of 1Corinthians in the King James translation, meaning not in the original language, but added by the translators. The word ""unknown"" is omitted from most modern translations, including the New King James Version, because it doesn't exist in the original manuscripts. Unfortunately, many have built whole doctrines around Christians receiving the gift of ""unknown tongues."" Jesus gave the perfect gift of tongues(languages), at the perfect time, when thousands would be gathered at Jerusalem, speaking dozens of different languages. That is why the gift was so prevalent during the infancy of the Christian movement. That is why He promised His disciples they would receive ""power""(dunamis in the Greek), so they could witness. Witness in the many tongues(languages) to the many gathered there. Dunamis/explosive like dynamite power! See Acts 1:8. But more recent tales of missionaries to foreign lands, and even in America's ever growing melting pot, reminds us that the true gifts of the Spirit are very much alive and well.But back to ""Marjoe."" Do you think the true gifts are poured out through an admitted deceiver, or are they individuals caught up in emotionalism, and maybe even ""false spirits"" as has been warned? Even those shown being ""slain-in-the-Spirit"" by Marjoe? This film is even more pertinent in these last days, when we are warned of ""spirits of demons"" performing ""signs"" in the Book of Revelation 16, verses 13 & 14.The times of great deception are upon us, and ""Marjoe"" is just a small window into the extent of demonic trickeries going on.The 1972 Academy Award winner for Best Documentary.",5,The Dangers of  Getting Caught-Up In Emotionalism,1150502400,"06 17, 2006",2006,2592,"['film', 'Marjoe', 'documented', 'proof', 'Christians', 'should', 'heed', 'Bible', 'warning', 'Try', 'spirits', '1John', '4:1', 'should', 'also', 'remember', 'gift', 'God', 'Satan', 'surely', 'counterfeit', 'Even', 'have', 'Bible', 'hand', 'study', 'may', 'be', 'misquoting', 'Just', 'speak-in-tongues', ""n't"", 'mean', 'true', 'gift', 'other', 'languages', 'was', 'case', 'Acts', 'chapter', '2', 'when', 'Jews', 'Middle', 'East', 'were', 'gathered', 'Jerusalem', 'celebrate', 'Pentecost', 'brought', 'many', 'different', 'languages', 'various', 'lands', 'See', '2:4-11', 'Bible', 'own', 'plain', 'explanation', 'other', 'tongues.The', 'true', 'gift', 'tongues', 'are', 'known', 'languages', 'world', 'not', 'unknown', 'King', 'James', 'unintentionally', 'led', 'believe', 'gift', 'tongues', 'simply', 'ability', 'speak', 'witness', 'language', 'was', 'previously', 'unknown', 'recipient', 'word', 'unknown', 'italics', 'chapters', '12-14', '1Corinthians', 'King', 'James', 'translation', 'meaning', 'not', 'original', 'language', 'added', 'translators', 'word', 'unknown', 'omitted', 'most', 'modern', 'translations', 'including', 'New', 'King', 'James', 'Version', ""n't"", 'exist', 'original', 'manuscripts', 'Unfortunately', 'many', 'have', 'built', 'whole', 'doctrines', 'Christians', 'receiving', 'gift', 'unknown', 'tongues', 'Jesus', 'gave', 'perfect', 'gift', 'tongues', 'languages', 'perfect', 'time', 'when', 'thousands', 'would', 'be', 'gathered', 'Jerusalem', 'speaking', 'dozens', 'different', 'languages', 'why', 'gift', 'was', 'so', 'prevalent', 'infancy', 'Christian', 'movement', 'why', 'promised', 'disciples', 'would', 'receive', 'power', 'dunamis', 'Greek', 'could', 'witness', 'Witness', 'many', 'tongues', 'languages', 'many', 'gathered', 'there', 'Dunamis/explosive', 'dynamite', 'power', 'See', '1:8', 'more', 'recent', 'tales', 'missionaries', 'foreign', 'lands', 'even', 'America', 'ever', 'growing', 'melting', 'pot', 'true', 'gifts', 'Spirit', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'alive', 'well.But', 'back', 'Marjoe', 'Do', 'think', 'true', 'gifts', 'are', 'poured', 'out', 'admitted', 'deceiver', 'are', 'individuals', 'caught', 'up', 'emotionalism', 'maybe', 'even', 'false', 'spirits', 'been', 'warned', 'Even', 'shown', 'being', 'slain-in-the-Spirit', 'Marjoe', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'pertinent', 'last', 'days', 'when', 'are', 'warned', 'spirits', 'demons', 'performing', 'signs', 'Book', 'Revelation', '16', '13', '14.The', 'times', 'great', 'deception', 'are', 'Marjoe', 'just', 'small', 'window', 'extent', 'demonic', 'trickeries', 'going', 'on.The', '1972', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'Best', 'Documentary']",N/A

He had a lot charisma. Not only was he dynamic in his acting he had a very distinctive voice that was both commanding and endearing. Back then I didn't know he honed his talents along the Bible Belt as a child preacher. Now that I am older and have read the biographies I can see where all of that charisma came from. This documentary gives us a taste of what Marjoe was going through in his early adult life when he decided that he didn't like the path he took. Instead of just walking away he decided to expose this double-life to the world in what ended up being an Academy Award willing documentary.Now as far as documentaries formats go this one is as dry as they come. In other words what you get is essentially raw footage with no serious editing of the content. There is no voice-over narration explaining what you see except for maybe the footage of his child years, and even then what are you are getting is an interview with Marjoe dubbed over the footage.In one way this makes the documentary a pure and untouched resource. On the other hand it does leave some footage left to interpretation by the viewer. I'm not saying that's a bad thing by any stretch. Just want all of you to know what you are getting into.The beauty of this documentary is that you get footage from both on the pulpit and backstage. Marjoe explains how he was raised and how he sees himself as a pastor. It's interesting to hear how he never really thought of God when he's preaching and how it was all trained by his parents. It's also interesting the ultimate message he says he is trying to portray: You don't need a spiritual figurehead to experience God. Unfortunately that message was brief and drowned out by the rest of the experiences in Marjoe, but keep it in mind when watching.The purity of the footage can also be a potential issue with the documentary. Mainly in that most of the footage is Marjoe preaching in various churches and tent revivals in his final tour. After a while the footage feels like it's getting drawn out as you see much of the same thing over and over. I will admit it's not quite as bad as I make it sound, but I do know my wife fell asleep halfway through and her exact words were, ""it was getting boring seeing the same thing over and over"". Still running at around an hour and forty-five minutes it's not such a long thing to watch. So take that as you will.Now this documentary has been out of print and practically missing until the negatives were found in 2002. The resulting transfer is great. This isn't one of those instances where you get a DVD with crappy 3rd or 4th generation theater film or a VHS transfer. The images are as crisp and clear as you can get from a documentary in the early 70's. Visually it's actually much better than I thought it would be knowing I'm seeing a restoration from the source negatives. Maybe the upscaling from my player has something to do with that, but even then this is a very clean transfer. Audio is about as good as you can get, which means it's clear with very little distortion that likely came from the source microphones to begin with. All in all I would be hard pressed to think you can get a better copy.The DVD doesn't have that much in the way of extras. There is a brief biography of the directors, but nothing on Marjoe's contributions to the film. No little bios of any other crew members either. Kind of a shame since that wouldn't have taken much work aside from research to add them in and the space on disk would be negligible. You also get an exhaustive list of documentaries from the company that include a synopsis and some even have a trailer you can watch. No setup menu that I recall. No other languages but English and no subtitles.Marjoe is a really good documentary that delves into the seedy side of evangelism that is still alive and well today (word of advise, when a preacher tells you miracles and blessings will happen to you IF you give him money walk away... God doesn't work that way). Doesn't matter if you're an atheist looking for more ammo or a believer who isn't afraid to see what can be wrong with religion; this is a good documentary with a great restoration and well worth a look.",4,Thought provoking if not comprehensive,1281052800,"08 6, 2010",2010,4321,"['When', 'was', 'little', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'when', 'saw', 'Marjoe', 'Gortner', 'act', 'television', 'show', 'movie', 'would', 'catch', 'had', 'lot', 'charisma', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'acting', 'had', 'very', 'distinctive', 'voice', 'was', 'commanding', 'endearing', 'Back', 'then', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'honed', 'talents', 'Bible', 'Belt', 'child', 'preacher', 'Now', 'am', 'older', 'have', 'read', 'biographies', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'charisma', 'came', 'documentary', 'taste', 'what', 'Marjoe', 'was', 'going', 'early', 'adult', 'life', 'when', 'decided', 'did', ""n't"", 'path', 'took', 'Instead', 'just', 'walking', 'away', 'decided', 'expose', 'double-life', 'world', 'what', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'Academy', 'Award', 'willing', 'documentary.Now', 'as', 'far', 'documentaries', 'formats', 'go', 'one', 'as', 'dry', 'come', 'other', 'words', 'what', 'get', 'essentially', 'raw', 'footage', 'serious', 'editing', 'content', 'voice-over', 'narration', 'explaining', 'what', 'see', 'maybe', 'footage', 'child', 'years', 'even', 'then', 'what', 'are', 'are', 'getting', 'interview', 'Marjoe', 'dubbed', 'footage.In', 'one', 'way', 'documentary', 'pure', 'untouched', 'resource', 'other', 'hand', 'leave', 'footage', 'left', 'interpretation', 'viewer', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'bad', 'thing', 'stretch', 'Just', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'into.The', 'beauty', 'documentary', 'get', 'footage', 'pulpit', 'backstage', 'Marjoe', 'how', 'was', 'raised', 'how', 'pastor', 'interesting', 'hear', 'how', 'never', 'really', 'thought', 'God', 'when', 'preaching', 'how', 'was', 'trained', 'parents', 'also', 'interesting', 'ultimate', 'message', 'trying', 'portray', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'spiritual', 'figurehead', 'experience', 'God', 'Unfortunately', 'message', 'was', 'brief', 'drowned', 'out', 'rest', 'experiences', 'Marjoe', 'keep', 'mind', 'when', 'watching.The', 'purity', 'footage', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'potential', 'issue', 'documentary', 'Mainly', 'most', 'footage', 'Marjoe', 'preaching', 'various', 'churches', 'tent', 'revivals', 'final', 'tour', 'footage', 'feels', 'getting', 'drawn', 'out', 'see', 'much', 'same', 'thing', 'will', 'admit', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'bad', 'make', 'sound', 'do', 'know', 'wife', 'fell', 'asleep', 'halfway', 'exact', 'words', 'were', 'was', 'getting', 'boring', 'seeing', 'same', 'thing', 'Still', 'running', 'hour', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'not', 'such', 'long', 'thing', 'watch', 'So', 'take', 'will.Now', 'documentary', 'been', 'print', 'practically', 'missing', 'negatives', 'were', 'found', '2002', 'resulting', 'transfer', 'great', ""n't"", 'one', 'instances', 'where', 'get', 'DVD', 'crappy', '3rd', '4th', 'generation', 'theater', 'film', 'VHS', 'transfer', 'images', 'are', 'crisp', 'clear', 'can', 'get', 'documentary', 'early', '70', 'Visually', 'actually', 'much', 'better', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'knowing', ""'m"", 'seeing', 'restoration', 'source', 'negatives', 'Maybe', 'upscaling', 'player', 'something', 'do', 'even', 'then', 'very', 'clean', 'transfer', 'Audio', 'as', 'good', 'can', 'get', 'clear', 'very', 'little', 'distortion', 'likely', 'came', 'source', 'microphones', 'begin', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'think', 'can', 'get', 'better', 'copy.The', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'way', 'extras', 'brief', 'biography', 'directors', 'nothing', 'Marjoe', 'contributions', 'film', 'little', 'bios', 'other', 'crew', 'members', 'either', 'Kind', 'shame', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'taken', 'much', 'work', 'aside', 'research', 'add', 'space', 'disk', 'would', 'be', 'negligible', 'also', 'get', 'exhaustive', 'list', 'documentaries', 'company', 'include', 'synopsis', 'even', 'have', 'trailer', 'can', 'watch', 'setup', 'recall', 'other', 'languages', 'English', 'subtitles.Marjoe', 'really', 'good', 'documentary', 'seedy', 'side', 'evangelism', 'still', 'alive', 'well', 'today', 'word', 'advise', 'when', 'preacher', 'miracles', 'blessings', 'will', 'happen', 'IF', 'give', 'money', 'walk', 'away', 'God', ""n't"", 'work', 'way', ""n't"", 'matter', ""'re"", 'atheist', 'looking', 'more', 'ammo', 'believer', 'who', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'see', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'wrong', 'religion', 'good', 'documentary', 'great', 'restoration', 'well', 'look']",N/A

Whatever one thinks of Marjoe, he is charismatic and he works an audience like a master. He admits that he borrowed some of his ""stage moves"" from Mick Jagger. One of Marjoe's sermons goes like this - ""For seven years, I was a heroin addict... pill popper, LSD tripper... high risin' and low slidin'... bustin' heads and droppin' reds... kickin' in doors and bangin' whores... settin' fires and slashin' tires... but then I met a man who was hung up for my hangups.""Some of the tricks that the evangelists use to pry money from the faithful seem obvious. In one scene, an evangelist at a tent revival says that he drives a Cadillac because he could not work a deal at any other dealership. God, in all of His wisdom, wanted the evangelist to have that Cadillac.I wish that the film had an update on Marjoe. He had a career as an actor-musician, but we learn nothing about it. Also, I would like to know how evangelicals reacted to the film.Marjoe is both a character study and an expose of religious hucksters. The film succeeds on both levels, but I found Marjoe to be the main attraction. There have been so many religious scandals since 1972 (the Bakkers, Jimmy Swaggart, Ted Haggard, etc.) that I expected the ministers to be phonies.I highly recommend Marjoe - it's entertaining and it makes you think.",4,God Wanted Me to Have a Cadillac!!!,1271548800,"04 18, 2010",2010,1811,"['Marjoe', 'Gortner', 'was', 'born', 'family', 'evangelists', '1943', 'was', 'four', 'years', 'old', 'Marjoe', 'was', 'preaching', 'Gospel', 'making', 'money', 'Eventually', 'Marjoe', 'conscience', 'caught', 'up', 'decided', 'leave', 'preaching', 'did', 'Marjoe', 'worked', 'film', 'crew', 'recording', 'evangelical', 'ministers', 'scams', 'result', 'was', 'Academy-Award', 'winning', '1972', 'documentary', 'Marjoe.The', 'filmmakers', 'struck', 'gold', 'finding', 'Marjoe', 'candid', 'frauds', 'bad', 'not', 'evil', 'one', 'Marjoe', 'charismatic', 'audience', 'master', 'borrowed', 'stage', 'moves', 'Mick', 'Jagger', 'One', 'Marjoe', 'sermons', 'seven', 'years', 'was', 'heroin', 'addict', 'pill', 'popper', 'LSD', 'tripper', 'high', 'risin', 'low', 'slidin', 'bustin', 'heads', 'droppin', 'reds', 'kickin', 'doors', 'bangin', 'whores', 'settin', 'fires', 'slashin', 'tires', 'then', 'met', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'hung', 'up', 'hangups', 'tricks', 'evangelists', 'use', 'pry', 'money', 'faithful', 'seem', 'obvious', 'one', 'scene', 'evangelist', 'tent', 'revival', 'Cadillac', 'could', 'not', 'work', 'deal', 'other', 'dealership', 'God', 'wisdom', 'wanted', 'evangelist', 'have', 'Cadillac.I', 'wish', 'film', 'had', 'update', 'Marjoe', 'had', 'career', 'actor-musician', 'learn', 'nothing', 'Also', 'would', 'like', 'know', 'how', 'evangelicals', 'reacted', 'film.Marjoe', 'character', 'study', 'expose', 'religious', 'hucksters', 'film', 'levels', 'found', 'Marjoe', 'be', 'main', 'attraction', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'many', 'religious', 'scandals', '1972', 'Bakkers', 'Jimmy', 'Swaggart', 'Ted', 'Haggard', 'etc', 'expected', 'ministers', 'be', 'phonies.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Marjoe', 'entertaining', 'think']",N/A
