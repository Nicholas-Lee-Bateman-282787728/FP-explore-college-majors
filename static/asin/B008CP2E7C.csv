1550260,A3BHHSORGTDW8K,B008CP2E7C,A customer,"[14, 15]","The music of 60's funk-folk musician Sixto Rodriguez was relatively lost to time, at least in the U.S., where it had been put on cult-status life support by a handful of people like David HolmesCome Get It I Got It: Mixed By David Holmes. This documentary, released in theaters, should finally give Rodriguez his due in the states.The story chronicles Rodriguez's resurrection (both figuratively and almost literally) in South Africa decades after the fact, where unbeknownst to him he had sold over 500,000 album copies even as he worked in obscurity doing construction  in Detroit. Not only did he have no idea of his popularity overseas, but he lived an almost homeless-like existence while his would be royalties were siphoned away by greedy record execs and bootleggers.The film is certainly a documentary on Rodriguez (AKA ""Sugarman"", a reference from one of his songs), and his music, but is more specifically a documentary on several people within the South African record world who try to find out how this ""bigger than Elvis"" musician truly lived. Rumors had him committing suicide on stage, and they get the shock of their life when they find out that he is actually still alive.Some have criticized the film for being more about the ""search"" rather than the ""man"" himself, but I find this unfounded.  For one, Rodriguez himself is painfully shy, and it is obvious that there are some things that he made off limits in his interviews (his wife, certain aspects of his family, etc.). While his story is amazing, there is only so much of it he is willing to tell, and to a large extent only so much of it that was under his control (to a certain degree he is an innocent bystander to his life's own outcomes). The historical backdrop of how his album had been adopted by the anti-Apartheid movement in South Africa is amazing and also had to be told.Director Malik Bendjelloul ultimately does a nice job balancing the man and the search for the man, his music and its impact on an entire continent. What the music represented and did was just as important as the music itself, and the film is not meant to be an autobiography or 90 minute concert video (although you'll hear enough to be inspired to pick up the soundtrack).In the end, this documentary highlights what can happen through faith and discipline when it intersects with random chance and the dreams of others. While the choices he made were done only to live life according to his own unique ethos, the surprising results still helped to shape a whole country. An affirming story for all who strive for something and whose efforts seemingly go unnoticed.Special features include a ""making of"", as well as commentary and side-discussions with Rodriguez and Bendjelloul. Some minor flaws aside, a 4 1/2 star effort that shows what happens when people become obsessed with trying to share greatness that they believe others have overlooked.",4,Ripples of discipline and faith (non-Bluray review),1353801600,"11 25, 2012",2012,2909,"['music', '60', 'funk-folk', 'musician', 'Sixto', 'Rodriguez', 'was', 'relatively', 'lost', 'time', 'least', 'U.S.', 'where', 'had', 'been', 'put', 'cult-status', 'life', 'support', 'handful', 'people', 'David', 'HolmesCome', 'Get', 'Got', 'Mixed', 'David', 'Holmes', 'documentary', 'released', 'theaters', 'should', 'finally', 'give', 'Rodriguez', 'due', 'states.The', 'story', 'chronicles', 'Rodriguez', 'resurrection', 'figuratively', 'almost', 'literally', 'South', 'Africa', 'decades', 'fact', 'where', 'unbeknownst', 'had', 'sold', '500,000', 'album', 'copies', 'even', 'worked', 'obscurity', 'doing', 'construction', 'Detroit', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'have', 'idea', 'popularity', 'overseas', 'lived', 'almost', 'homeless-like', 'existence', 'would', 'be', 'royalties', 'were', 'siphoned', 'away', 'greedy', 'record', 'execs', 'bootleggers.The', 'film', 'certainly', 'documentary', 'Rodriguez', 'AKA', 'Sugarman', 'reference', 'one', 'songs', 'music', 'more', 'specifically', 'documentary', 'several', 'people', 'South', 'African', 'record', 'world', 'who', 'try', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'bigger', 'Elvis', 'musician', 'truly', 'lived', 'Rumors', 'had', 'committing', 'suicide', 'stage', 'get', 'shock', 'life', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'actually', 'still', 'alive.Some', 'have', 'criticized', 'film', 'being', 'more', 'search', 'rather', 'man', 'find', 'unfounded', 'one', 'Rodriguez', 'painfully', 'shy', 'obvious', 'are', 'things', 'made', 'off', 'limits', 'interviews', 'wife', 'certain', 'aspects', 'family', 'etc.', 'story', 'amazing', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'willing', 'tell', 'large', 'extent', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'control', 'certain', 'degree', 'innocent', 'bystander', 'life', 'own', 'outcomes', 'historical', 'backdrop', 'how', 'album', 'had', 'been', 'adopted', 'anti-Apartheid', 'movement', 'South', 'Africa', 'amazing', 'also', 'had', 'be', 'told.Director', 'Malik', 'Bendjelloul', 'ultimately', 'nice', 'job', 'balancing', 'man', 'search', 'man', 'music', 'impact', 'entire', 'continent', 'What', 'music', 'represented', 'did', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'important', 'music', 'film', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'autobiography', '90', 'minute', 'concert', 'video', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'enough', 'be', 'inspired', 'pick', 'up', 'soundtrack', 'end', 'documentary', 'highlights', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'faith', 'discipline', 'when', 'random', 'chance', 'dreams', 'others', 'choices', 'made', 'were', 'done', 'only', 'live', 'life', 'according', 'own', 'unique', 'ethos', 'surprising', 'results', 'still', 'helped', 'shape', 'whole', 'country', 'affirming', 'story', 'who', 'strive', 'something', 'efforts', 'seemingly', 'go', 'unnoticed.Special', 'features', 'include', 'making', 'as', 'well', 'commentary', 'side-discussions', 'Rodriguez', 'Bendjelloul', 'minor', 'flaws', 'aside', '4', '1/2', 'star', 'effort', 'what', 'when', 'people', 'become', 'obsessed', 'trying', 'share', 'greatness', 'believe', 'others', 'have', 'overlooked']",N/A
1550261,A1LBIZLET9CW1I,B008CP2E7C,A fellow with a keyboard,"[56, 89]","I sprinted to the nearest movie theater immediately after reading this line from the good soldier of cinema, Mr. Roger Ebert: ""I hope you're able to see this film... and yes, it exists because we need for it to.""It hurts to give this movie less than 5 stars because it delivered precious rewards. It introduced me to some of the greatest music to come out of possibly the greatest music-producing city. And it introduced me to the extraordinary human being who is Sixto Diaz Rodriguez.  I applaud and bow to this movie for both of those things. I am richer for it.I was impressed that this film was directed and edited by a first-time filmmaker because the cinematography in parts lifted the hair on my skin. He made Detroit, in its decay, look beautiful! There was such attention to detail and such aesthetic awareness in every inch of the camera's frame that parts of this movie were less like a documentary and more like an oil painting.Can you see my praise? It's glowing.Okay, now for the non-glowing stuff.Outside the cinematography, this movie has the scent trails of a first-time filmmaker, one who didn't know his own weaknesses. The hardest and most important element of filmmaking is editing, and that's where this movie falls short. Certain interviews hang limply from the main thread. Certain details are overcooked. Attention is given to interviewees' faces at times when our attention was supposed to have been on the music.Those are nitpicky criticisms, but I'm not done yet. This movie falls flat in one serious and unforgivable way.Rodriguez's story is so important because of (1) the extraordinary music and (2) the extraordinary man. But the focus of this movie is on neither of those things. Instead, the focus is on his huge but unknown-to-him success in South Africa, and then several South Africans' attempts to find out whatever happened to him. It's undeniably an interesting and bizarre series of events, one that provides some nice twists and crime-solving and climaxes that audiences like, but it is not a series of events that tells us about the far more compelling story: Rodriguez and his music. There are about 5 minutes devoted to how/why the music was created and about another 5 minutes devoted to how/why he has been living since the record label dropped him, and the remaining 76 minutes are devoted to the South African events.What makes the South African emphasis especially troubling is that its story treats external accomplishments of fame and recognition and finances and screaming audiences as the climax and resolution. These things, the movie tells us, are what Rodriguez has been spiritually lacking all his life. But one listen to ""Like Janis"" or ""Cause"" or ""Sandrevan Lullaby"" and the premise collapses. The message from the movie is that there's a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, but the message from Rodriguez's life is almost precisely the opposite: There is nobility in hard work and sacrifice, regardless of whether anyone notices. This movie wants us to remember Rodriguez as the poor prophet who was resurrected as a stadium-rocker playing to sold-out, raucous audiences. I'd rather remember Rodriguez as the anonymous drifter sitting next to the little furnace in his apartment, warming the walls with his music.***P.S. - Over and over again, this movie kept reminding me ofBill Cunningham New York.",3,Rodriguez exists because we need for him to,1352505600,"11 10, 2012",2012,3364,"['sprinted', 'nearest', 'movie', 'theater', 'immediately', 'reading', 'line', 'good', 'soldier', 'cinema', 'Mr.', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'hope', ""'re"", 'able', 'see', 'film', 'yes', 'need', 'give', 'movie', 'less', '5', 'stars', 'delivered', 'precious', 'rewards', 'introduced', 'greatest', 'music', 'come', 'possibly', 'greatest', 'music-producing', 'city', 'introduced', 'extraordinary', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'Sixto', 'Diaz', 'Rodriguez', 'applaud', 'bow', 'movie', 'things', 'am', 'richer', 'it.I', 'was', 'impressed', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'edited', 'first-time', 'filmmaker', 'cinematography', 'parts', 'lifted', 'hair', 'skin', 'made', 'Detroit', 'decay', 'look', 'beautiful', 'was', 'such', 'attention', 'detail', 'such', 'aesthetic', 'awareness', 'inch', 'camera', 'frame', 'parts', 'movie', 'were', 'less', 'documentary', 'more', 'oil', 'painting.Can', 'see', 'praise', 'glowing.Okay', 'now', 'non-glowing', 'stuff.Outside', 'cinematography', 'movie', 'scent', 'trails', 'first-time', 'filmmaker', 'one', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'own', 'weaknesses', 'hardest', 'most', 'important', 'element', 'filmmaking', 'editing', 'where', 'movie', 'short', 'Certain', 'interviews', 'hang', 'limply', 'main', 'thread', 'Certain', 'details', 'are', 'overcooked', 'Attention', 'given', 'interviewees', 'times', 'when', 'attention', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'been', 'music.Those', 'are', 'nitpicky', 'criticisms', ""'m"", 'not', 'done', 'yet', 'movie', 'flat', 'one', 'serious', 'unforgivable', 'way.Rodriguez', 'story', 'so', 'important', '1', 'extraordinary', 'music', '2', 'extraordinary', 'man', 'focus', 'movie', 'neither', 'things', 'Instead', 'focus', 'huge', 'unknown-to-him', 'success', 'South', 'Africa', 'then', 'several', 'South', 'Africans', 'attempts', 'find', 'out', 'happened', 'undeniably', 'interesting', 'bizarre', 'series', 'events', 'one', 'nice', 'twists', 'crime-solving', 'climaxes', 'audiences', 'not', 'series', 'events', 'far', 'more', 'compelling', 'story', 'Rodriguez', 'music', 'are', '5', 'minutes', 'devoted', 'how/why', 'music', 'was', 'created', '5', 'minutes', 'devoted', 'how/why', 'been', 'living', 'record', 'label', 'dropped', 'remaining', '76', 'minutes', 'are', 'devoted', 'South', 'African', 'South', 'African', 'emphasis', 'especially', 'troubling', 'story', 'treats', 'external', 'accomplishments', 'fame', 'recognition', 'finances', 'screaming', 'audiences', 'climax', 'resolution', 'things', 'movie', 'are', 'what', 'Rodriguez', 'been', 'spiritually', 'lacking', 'life', 'one', 'listen', 'Janis', 'Cause', 'Sandrevan', 'Lullaby', 'premise', 'message', 'movie', 'pot', 'gold', 'end', 'rainbow', 'message', 'Rodriguez', 'life', 'almost', 'precisely', 'opposite', 'nobility', 'hard', 'work', 'sacrifice', 'regardless', 'anyone', 'notices', 'movie', 'remember', 'Rodriguez', 'poor', 'prophet', 'who', 'was', 'resurrected', 'stadium-rocker', 'playing', 'sold-out', 'raucous', 'audiences', ""'d"", 'rather', 'remember', 'Rodriguez', 'anonymous', 'drifter', 'sitting', 'next', 'little', 'furnace', 'apartment', 'warming', 'walls', 'music.***P.S', 'over', 'again', 'movie', 'kept', 'reminding', 'ofBill', 'Cunningham', 'New', 'York']",N/A

I didn't once get the feeling that the story of Rodriguez was overly embellished or fake; indeed, by the final quarter of the film, I was actually brushing away tears.  That may seem unremarkable, but I'm one of the few who didn't cry duringTitanic, much to the dismay of my female friends.The producers/directors did an excellent job telling the story of ""Sugar Man"" Rodriguez.  We were hypothesizing and making predictions throughout the entire film, until the mystery of Rodriguez's death was solved towards the end of the movie.  No spoilers here... the story stands on its own merit.The best part, in my opinion, is the fact that Rodriguez spent his life being a hard-working man who cared about his family, his community, and who loved music.  His legacy is found in everything he touched, and seems to be the epitome of ""role model"".

Here one moment, and the next gone. He released 2 records in the US, and then dropped off the map. But not in South Africa. With the anti-Apartheid movement raging in the early 70's, his anti-structural, anti-establishment based songs struck a cord with the local people. He became more then a legend. Rodriguez outsold Elvis, The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan. But no one knew anything about him, or about his death.Did he douse himself with petrol and burn himself to death. Did he shoot himself onstage?

I and many others in my class believed that the white minority were behind the oppression in South Africa. After viewing this film repeatedly I began to realize that the youth in 1980's south Africa were innocent. The film does show demonstrators against Apartheid therefore this film is more than just a music documentary. It is very confusing viewing a film from the point of view from South Africans believing that they were innocent of Apartheid and since the subject of censorship was crucial in this film therefore I just can't believe that the white youth of 1980's South Africa were just music loving kids.

If the answer is &#8220;no&#8221;, and the story really is true, then reality has indeed trumped fiction.  That is certainly the case with &#8220;Searching for Sugar Man&#8221; (SSM):  the storyline appears too good to be true &#8211; but it is.  It is not only a great storyline, but an enlightening portrait of a charismatic, enigmatic man and several important historical eras.  By telling the story of Rodriguez, the filmmakers hold a mirror to two separate-but-linked societies and tell us much about ourselves.At the center of SSM is, of course, Rodriguez and his music.  If forced to describe him in three words or less, I think &#8220;Detroit&#8217;s Bob Dylan&#8221; are as good as any others.  Like Dylan, his songs are poems put to music, with each word and phrase carrying much meaning, creating a strong emotional impact on the listener.  I&#8217;ve actually never much cared for Dylan&#8217;s music, as his time and era do not match mine, and I can&#8217;t stand Dylan&#8217;s singing voice.  By contrast I actually enjoyed Rodriguez&#8217;s music and his singing &#8211; SSM contains at least portions of most of the songs on his two albums.  As Rodriguez hails from Detroit, from very different economic circumstances than the college-educated middle class Robert Zimmerman, his songs are grittier, edgier, and more fatalistic.  Perhaps that is why they didn&#8217;t appeal to the masses in the U.S., but did so in South Africa.Or maybe it was a case of Dylan having a more appealing persona and appearance.  As I learned when visiting Memphis and the old Sun Record studios, Elvis was far from the only person in Memphis at the time playing that type of rock-and-roll music.  But he had it all: the music, the voice, the stage presence and the good looks, and he is the one who rocketed to superstardom, while others achieved only minor success or remained in obscurity.  Something similar may have happened with Rodriguez in the U.S.The process by which Rodriguez&#8217;s music became popular in South Africa is startling, and is only possible because it was, at the time, a closed society.  One mystery that SSM cannot quite solve is what happened to all the royalty money, although the interview with Clarence Avant provides the strongest clue.  But money aside, the stories Rodriguez&#8217;s fans tell about the impact his music had on their lives are heartwarming.  The ending of the movie couldn&#8217;t have been better scripted if it had been written by Hollywood&#8217;s best &#8211; and yet it wasn&#8217;t.

There's something wrong here"". And it turns out I was right, of which more later. Sixto Rodriguez was an earthy Bob Dylan-like singer-songwriter from Detroit who released two well-reviewed albums in the early 1970s which flopped completely. He then vanished and was never heard of again. Unknown to him, though, his records became wildly popular in South Africa, where his message that people could think for themselves reverberated in a society where even privileged whites felt oppressed by apartheid. Once the old regime had fallen two South African fans decided to track down the mysterious singer and through hard work, perserverance and luck, they discovered he was alive and working on a construction site, completely clueless about his enormous popularity halfway around the world. They brought him over to South Africa in 1998 and he gave six sold-out concerts, finally immersing himself in the kind of adoration he'd missed out on the first time round. It's a great story, the music is great, and the effect is tremendously uplifting. Finally, a poor beaten-up guy gets the recognition he deserves.Unfortunately, it's not the complete story. While Rodriguez may well indeed have had no idea of his standing in South Africa, he wasn't entirely divorced from the showbusiness side of music either. For all the film would like you to believe Rodriguez gave up music in 1973 or so to help tear down buildings in Detroit, he toured Australia in both 1979 and 1981. The more I think about this the more disturbed I am. The film makers did not include this very important fact in Searching for Sugar Man, perhaps because it would spoil the clean sightlines of their own film.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","SEARCHING FOR SUGAR MAN (2012, 86 minutes) was a staggering documentary for me to watch ~ even moreso since I just saw it last night and before then hadn't even heard of it.In brief, this is the astonishing and almost unbelievable story of Sixto Diaz Rodriguez, a/k/a Rodriguez: a genius composer, singer and performer who made his 1st album in 1970, made a 2nd, saw both flop miserably, completed an unproduced 3rd album, then, well, sort of vanished.The white producers who discovered Rodriguez in 1969 describe an eerie scene, near the river in Detroit. They went into a terribly smoky little bar after emerging from the midnight fog, saw a man in black with his back turned to the audience as he performed. Thus their first glimpse of Rodriguez. They quickly signed him to the A&M; label.Clarence Avant, head of Motown Records, Sussex Records and Sussex's subsidiary label, A&M;, was Rodriguez's first big-label producer as the owner of Sussex/A&M; Records. Though Avant clearly loved Rodriguez and found him a stunning talent, he also knew from sales that Rodriguez was doomed. No fame for him; too advanced. Avant comments that the album flopped in California and that seemed to be the end of Rodriguez.What it seems Sussex did was create offshore record deals and one such country was South Africa. A&M; as well as Sussex combined and released Rodriguez's title in South Africa, though the claim is no one is certain how Rodriguez's American release got into the country in the first place.This is what you get to learn at first, except for one more thing: in South Africa, Rodriguez became a legend, ""bigger than Elvis"". So he has continued in the hearts of South Africans to this very day. So here, some South African journalistic filmmakers sought to discover what became of their American hero.Now ... get ready.South Africans had been plagued by the sadness of powerful rumors that Rodriguez had committed suicide, either by dousing himself with petrol and starting a fire or some other gruesome way, onstage. When they found out Rodriguez was alive, well and in Detroit (his 'hometown') they went nuts and made this film!The rest I will leave for you to discover. Based on the 1970 music of Rodriguez's, performed in this film perhaps for the first time ever to an American audience, I'll say this: Rodriguez is an eerily brilliant composer and singer who is easily the equal of John Lennon and Brian Wilson. It scared me to death.I couldn't stop asking myself, Could this really have happened here in America? Was it because Rodriguez is Mexican and he came with his grandparents as immigrants to labor in construction? Was it his surname? Was it his turning his back on audiences, a thing Miles Davis copied with brilliant success? (Avant produced Davis often.) The South Africans didn't seem to mind!The entire documentary is tightly made and very well produced. Rodriguez's music is featured, but is not obnoxious to the ears or played at the wrong time ~ a big problem I find with many films these days. Rodriguez himself is charming and enchanting, and this too is odd because aside from being a genius, he's just a plain old demolition contractor from Detroit-by-way-of-Mexico.See this stunning film and discover what the ""American dream"" really is, and what it definitely isn't. You'll love the film, but you'll hate what you discover about America.",5,"Sixto Dias, maybe he was a Jedi, but Rodriguez is his name!",1378512000,"09 7, 2013",2013,3370,"['SEARCHING', 'FOR', 'SUGAR', 'MAN', '2012', '86', 'minutes', 'was', 'staggering', 'documentary', 'watch', '~', 'even', 'moreso', 'just', 'saw', 'last', 'night', 'then', 'had', ""n't"", 'even', 'heard', 'it.In', 'brief', 'astonishing', 'almost', 'unbelievable', 'story', 'Sixto', 'Diaz', 'Rodriguez', 'a/k/a', 'Rodriguez', 'genius', 'composer', 'singer', 'performer', 'who', 'made', '1st', 'album', '1970', 'made', '2nd', 'saw', 'flop', 'miserably', 'completed', 'unproduced', '3rd', 'album', 'then', 'well', 'sort', 'vanished.The', 'white', 'producers', 'who', 'discovered', 'Rodriguez', '1969', 'describe', 'eerie', 'scene', 'river', 'Detroit', 'went', 'terribly', 'smoky', 'little', 'bar', 'emerging', 'midnight', 'fog', 'saw', 'man', 'black', 'back', 'turned', 'audience', 'performed', 'Thus', 'first', 'glimpse', 'Rodriguez', 'quickly', 'signed', 'A', 'M', 'label.Clarence', 'Avant', 'head', 'Motown', 'Records', 'Sussex', 'Records', 'Sussex', 'subsidiary', 'label', 'A', 'M', 'was', 'Rodriguez', 'first', 'big-label', 'producer', 'owner', 'Sussex/A', 'M', 'Records', 'Though', 'Avant', 'clearly', 'loved', 'Rodriguez', 'found', 'stunning', 'talent', 'also', 'knew', 'sales', 'Rodriguez', 'was', 'doomed', 'fame', 'too', 'advanced', 'Avant', 'comments', 'album', 'flopped', 'California', 'seemed', 'be', 'end', 'Rodriguez.What', 'Sussex', 'did', 'was', 'create', 'offshore', 'record', 'deals', 'one', 'such', 'country', 'was', 'South', 'Africa', 'A', 'M', 'as', 'well', 'Sussex', 'combined', 'released', 'Rodriguez', 'title', 'South', 'Africa', 'claim', 'one', 'certain', 'how', 'Rodriguez', 'American', 'release', 'got', 'country', 'first', 'place.This', 'what', 'get', 'learn', 'first', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'South', 'Africa', 'Rodriguez', 'became', 'legend', 'bigger', 'Elvis', 'continued', 'hearts', 'South', 'Africans', 'very', 'day', 'So', 'here', 'South', 'African', 'journalistic', 'filmmakers', 'sought', 'discover', 'what', 'became', 'American', 'hero.Now', 'get', 'ready.South', 'Africans', 'had', 'been', 'plagued', 'sadness', 'powerful', 'rumors', 'Rodriguez', 'had', 'committed', 'suicide', 'either', 'dousing', 'petrol', 'starting', 'fire', 'other', 'gruesome', 'way', 'onstage', 'When', 'found', 'out', 'Rodriguez', 'was', 'alive', 'well', 'Detroit', ""'hometown"", 'went', 'nuts', 'made', 'film', 'rest', 'will', 'leave', 'discover', 'Based', '1970', 'music', 'Rodriguez', 'performed', 'film', 'perhaps', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'American', 'audience', ""'ll"", 'say', 'Rodriguez', 'eerily', 'brilliant', 'composer', 'singer', 'who', 'easily', 'equal', 'John', 'Lennon', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'scared', 'death.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'asking', 'Could', 'really', 'have', 'happened', 'here', 'America', 'Was', 'Rodriguez', 'Mexican', 'came', 'grandparents', 'immigrants', 'labor', 'construction', 'Was', 'surname', 'Was', 'turning', 'back', 'audiences', 'thing', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'copied', 'brilliant', 'success', 'Avant', 'produced', 'Davis', 'often', 'South', 'Africans', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'mind', 'entire', 'documentary', 'tightly', 'made', 'very', 'well', 'produced', 'Rodriguez', 'music', 'featured', 'not', 'obnoxious', 'ears', 'played', 'wrong', 'time', 'big', 'problem', 'find', 'many', 'films', 'days', 'Rodriguez', 'charming', 'enchanting', 'too', 'odd', 'aside', 'being', 'genius', 'just', 'plain', 'old', 'demolition', 'contractor', 'Detroit-by-way-of-Mexico.See', 'stunning', 'film', 'discover', 'what', 'American', 'dream', 'really', 'what', 'definitely', ""n't"", ""'ll"", 'love', 'film', ""'ll"", 'hate', 'what', 'discover', 'America']",N/A

Both were dismal failures. But his records made their way to South Africa, where he became the soundtrack of the anti-apartheid movement. Rodriquez stopped making records and worked in construction for 40 years, never rising above working class means. In 1997, two South Africans found him in Detroit and brought him to Cape Town for series of concerts. It is a powerful moment of recognition and redemption. Thankfully, the world has been able to show it's appreciation to Rodriguez while he is alive. Amazingly, he is not bitter or mournful over his time in the wilderness (or the horrific fact that he did not get any of the money from his sales in South Africa) -- at heart, he is a noble artist who was happy for any chance to play for people.The documentary is extremely well done.

Pouliot,"[0, 0]","""Sugar Man"" tells  the story of singer-guitarist Sixto Rodriguez, an impoverished Detroit musician who recorded an album or two in the 1970s and then dropped off the map. Rumors of his death were rife, if contradictory. By an odd twist of fate, his music reached apartheid-era South Africa, where it became wildly popular, becoming the anthem of many young whites who opposed their racist government.The worst part about the film is the trailer, which blows the film's central secret (avert your eyes if you don't want to know) that Rodriguez was still alive. The film follows his rediscovery, his triumphal tour of South Africa, and his return to Detroit.As a feel-good story, the film comes up a little short. Rodriguez, a shambling, mumbling, super hipster, seems satisfied with living in a bare apartment, warming himself with scrap lumber. He doesn't seem all that interested in moving out and up. And his music, with its 1970s folk feel, while good, might not be all that marketable today. ""Searching for Sugarman"" is structured as a feel-good story -- obscurity to fame to obscurity to (maybe) fame. The film clearly wants us to be blown away by his music. But the film's yearning  is hampered by its own hero. He, cool to the point of frostbite, could truly not care less if his music was loved and his talent appreciated. Is that too cool?

There were stories about his suicide on stage during a concert, a prison death, among other things, but no one knew how he'd actually died, and since he'd never been really popular in the U.S. during his career, the mystery didn't really begin to pique interest in the filmmakers until they realized that, though he'd been from Detroit when he released his albums in the 70's, he'd never made much of a splash in the U.S., but his following in Apartheid-ravaged South Africa had been massive. How, then, they wondered, did he simply disappear?The legends of his demise created a puzzle the filmmakers had to work through to find out what had happened to Rodriguez. Could he have actually committed suicide onstage? Did he die in prison?The truth they found out is a heartwarming revelation and a study in humility and modesty that is sure to satisfy the viewer. I saw this movie in the theater and left the viewing very moved by the man and his story. His humble, simple nature is an example to us all.

Gordon,"[2, 2]","One of those ""it's so weird if this was a fiction film everyone would say it wasn't believable enough"" stories.Forgive me if I'm cryptic, but this is one story where you really don't want spoilers.An extremely talented young U.S. singer songwriter in the Bob Dylan mold, calling himself simply 'Rodriguez' released2 LPs in the early 70s. But despite positive critical reaction (and the many songs we hear on the soundtrack are quitegood) both LPs bombed, and Rodriguez lost his recording contract, never to record again.  Reportedly he then killedhimself on-stage.Meanwhile, somehow in the years after all this, his music caught on among the white liberal anti-apartheid youth of South Africa (where anumber of Rodriguez's songs were banned for being too political), and he became an ever growing cult figure, eventually having a huge fanbase.But beyond the paltry clues left by his two albums, there's little that his legion of South African fans can find out about their hero. So twoSouth Africans with a deep love for the music start a detective hunt for the real story of what happened to Rodriguez. The film is full ofenergy, ups and downs, and some clever story telling techniques.Some have argued that the construction is 'manipulative', but I think it's a perfectly valid way to tell a tale. Yes, they could have givenus all the answers up front, since they're now known, but by having us go on the journey with our two amateur sleuths, and finding out onlywhat they knew at each moment makes for a much better way to experience the story with them.A unique and wonderful film.",5,"Wonderful, well told documentary",1351123200,"10 25, 2012",2012,1585,"['One', 'so', 'weird', 'was', 'fiction', 'film', 'everyone', 'would', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'believable', 'enough', 'stories.Forgive', ""'m"", 'cryptic', 'one', 'story', 'where', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoilers.An', 'extremely', 'talented', 'young', 'U.S.', 'singer', 'songwriter', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'mold', 'calling', 'simply', ""'Rodriguez"", 'released2', 'LPs', 'early', '70s', 'positive', 'critical', 'reaction', 'many', 'songs', 'hear', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'quitegood', 'LPs', 'bombed', 'Rodriguez', 'lost', 'recording', 'contract', 'never', 'record', 'again', 'Reportedly', 'then', 'killedhimself', 'on-stage.Meanwhile', 'somehow', 'years', 'music', 'caught', 'white', 'liberal', 'anti-apartheid', 'youth', 'South', 'Africa', 'where', 'anumber', 'Rodriguez', 'songs', 'were', 'banned', 'being', 'too', 'political', 'became', 'ever', 'growing', 'cult', 'figure', 'eventually', 'having', 'huge', 'fanbase.But', 'paltry', 'clues', 'left', 'two', 'albums', 'little', 'legion', 'South', 'African', 'fans', 'can', 'find', 'out', 'hero', 'So', 'twoSouth', 'Africans', 'deep', 'love', 'music', 'start', 'detective', 'hunt', 'real', 'story', 'what', 'happened', 'Rodriguez', 'film', 'full', 'ofenergy', 'ups', 'downs', 'clever', 'story', 'telling', 'techniques.Some', 'have', 'argued', 'construction', ""'manipulative"", 'think', 'perfectly', 'valid', 'way', 'tell', 'tale', 'Yes', 'could', 'have', 'givenus', 'answers', 'up', 'front', ""'re"", 'now', 'known', 'having', 'go', 'journey', 'two', 'amateur', 'sleuths', 'finding', 'out', 'knew', 'moment', 'much', 'better', 'way', 'experience', 'story', 'them.A', 'unique', 'wonderful', 'film']",N/A

From the early to late Sixties, Motown had put the Motor City on the musical map &#8211; so emerging singer-songwriters cut their teeth in bars and cafes, soaked up the campus/street politics and hoped to get noticed. After an early 7&#8221; single in 1967 on Impact that folded without trace - enter Producer Dennis Coffey and Sussex Records (home of Bill Withers). His debut American album &#8220;Cold Fact&#8221; was born (March 1970 on Sussex SXBS 7000) followed the next year by &#8220;Coming From Reality&#8221; (November 1971 on Sussex SXBS 7012). But despite their musical quality &#8211; few noticed locally. Legend in fact has it that &#8220;Coming From Reality&#8221; sold less than 20 copies.Cut to the other side of the world &#8211; South Africa &#8211; and young black and white kids are plagued by Apartheid. With lyrics like &#8220;drinking from a Judas cup&#8230;papa don&#8217;t like new ideas round here&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;I wonder will this hatred ever end?&#8221; &#8211; they pick up on the Arthur Lee melodies and the Bob Dylan protest lyrics and the soulful Jose Feliciano voice and the album becomes a huge hit over there. So Rodriguez tours and those shows are emblazoned into the memory. But then the mysterious American immigrant troubadour disappears&#8230;some even ruminating that he&#8217;s dead &#8211; or never existed at all.Cut to decades later and a South African secondhand record-store owner wonders what happened to this huge and positive influence in his life? And so the journey begins&#8230;searching for the sugar man&#8230;As a cartoon figure wanders across the dirty city streets of a cold Detroit with a guitar case strapped over his shoulder - you listen to tracks like &#8220;Crucify Your Mind&#8221; and &#8220;Inner City Blues&#8221; &#8211; and you wonder how in God&#8217;s name you&#8217;ve never heard this great music before. Politics, Mafia swindles, radio indifference &#8211; all of it probably. But it&#8217;s what happens next that makes you double take and grin from ear to ear all the way to the joyous end&#8230;I urge you to buy either of the stunning Light in The Attic CD/LP remasters of both albums (&#8220;Cold Fact&#8221; on LITA 036 or &#8220;Coming From Reality&#8221; on LITA 038).

So many are turned off to the term documentary and those that are lose so much by missing movies like this one. This is a story that will captivate you and uplift you by the end of the film. It's a story that begins sad and ends as story that inspires.In 1970 Sixto Rodriguez released his first album. The producers of the album thought they had a hit. Here was someone from Detroit singing about the problems he saw, inspired by what was going on around him and they had helped make this album. With lyrics that brought Bob Dylan to mind, a voice that at times sounds like Phil Ochs, why wouldn't they expect great success. Unfortunately it never happened. Even when his second LP came out a year or so later, nothing. With those two albums released, Rodriguez disappeared.Of course that was only in America. In other countries Rodriguez had a more interesting career and successful one. On South Africa this was when apartheid was going strong and young people were protesting against their government there. A bootleg of Rodriguez' album made its way to that country and spread like wildfire. In the songs found on the album a generation found a voice that spoke of things they were feeling. The government's response was to ban the playing of certain songs on the air which of course only made them that more popular.That's a great story in itself. One would think it was enough. But that's just the first third of the story. That's how amazing this story is. Years go by and things change both in the US and in South Africa. When a CD reissue of Rodriguez' album was about to be released a record store owner was asked to write the liner notes. A questioned posed there inspired an investigative reporter to try and find out what happened to Rodriguez. Word was out that he had died. Stories ranged from him shooting himself onstage to lighting himself on fire before his audience. As the investigation continued, the writer was shocked to find that Rodriguez was still alive and well and living in Detroit.Enough of a story right? But no! Found alive and well these same two men tried to let Rodriguez know just how influential his music had been to an entire generation. A record that sold so low as to make no notice in the states had sold over 500,000 in South Africa alone. So it was only natural that these same fans got Rodriguez to come to Cape Town to perform for those same fans. And perform he did...6 sold out shows to crowds to thousands of people.The story of Rodriguez was interesting enough to inspire the director of this film. The success of the film was enough to interest the folks at 60 MINUTES who did a piece on his story, the only reason I didn't feel I was giving spoilers here in this review. But the truth is that just hearing the story, just knowing what happened, isn't near as interesting and amazing to learn as it is while watching this movie.As with any musician there will be many who aren't crazy about each and every song but my guess is that when this movie is finished you'll be tapping your toe to several and more than likely be looking for a CD by Rodriguez. At the same time you'll wonder why his career didn't skyrocket here just like those who produced his albums thought.The tale of Rodriguez is one that will touch your heart and have you amazed at this man as he is today. What he does with his newfound success is revealed at the end of the film. The saddest thing that could happen is for people to not discover the music of Rodriguez or the man behind it all. This is a beautiful film that tells the tale well and will hold your interest from start to finish.",5,DISCOVERING RODRIGUEZ,1359417600,"01 29, 2013",2013,4088,"['sit', 'hear', 'typing', 'soundtrack', 'week', 'best', 'bet', 'playing', 'loudly', 'PC', 'When', 'finished', 'movie', 'found', 'wanted', 'listen', 'songs', 'again', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'wear', 'off', 'eventually', 'music', 'choices', 'seem', 'do', 'few', 'days', 'music', 'may', 'change', 'amazement', 'felt', 'watching', 'story', 'unfold', 'will', 'stay', 'forever.SEARCHING', 'FOR', 'SUGAR', 'MAN', 'documentary', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'prevent', 'watching', 'movie', 'So', 'many', 'are', 'turned', 'off', 'term', 'documentary', 'are', 'lose', 'so', 'much', 'missing', 'movies', 'one', 'story', 'will', 'captivate', 'uplift', 'end', 'film', 'story', 'sad', 'as', 'story', 'inspires.In', '1970', 'Sixto', 'Rodriguez', 'released', 'first', 'album', 'producers', 'album', 'thought', 'had', 'hit', 'Here', 'was', 'someone', 'Detroit', 'singing', 'problems', 'saw', 'inspired', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'had', 'helped', 'make', 'album', 'lyrics', 'brought', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'mind', 'voice', 'times', 'sounds', 'Phil', 'Ochs', 'why', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'great', 'success', 'never', 'happened', 'Even', 'when', 'second', 'LP', 'came', 'out', 'year', 'so', 'later', 'nothing', 'two', 'albums', 'released', 'Rodriguez', 'course', 'was', 'only', 'America', 'other', 'countries', 'Rodriguez', 'had', 'more', 'interesting', 'career', 'successful', 'one', 'South', 'Africa', 'was', 'when', 'apartheid', 'was', 'going', 'strong', 'young', 'people', 'were', 'protesting', 'government', 'there', 'bootleg', 'Rodriguez', 'album', 'made', 'way', 'country', 'spread', 'wildfire', 'songs', 'found', 'album', 'generation', 'found', 'voice', 'spoke', 'things', 'were', 'feeling', 'government', 'response', 'was', 'ban', 'playing', 'certain', 'songs', 'air', 'course', 'only', 'made', 'more', 'popular.That', 'great', 'story', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'was', 'enough', 'just', 'first', 'third', 'story', 'how', 'amazing', 'story', 'Years', 'go', 'things', 'change', 'US', 'South', 'Africa', 'When', 'CD', 'reissue', 'Rodriguez', 'album', 'was', 'be', 'released', 'record', 'store', 'owner', 'was', 'asked', 'write', 'liner', 'notes', 'questioned', 'posed', 'inspired', 'investigative', 'reporter', 'try', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'Rodriguez', 'Word', 'was', 'out', 'had', 'died', 'Stories', 'ranged', 'shooting', 'onstage', 'lighting', 'fire', 'audience', 'investigation', 'continued', 'writer', 'was', 'shocked', 'find', 'Rodriguez', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'well', 'living', 'Detroit.Enough', 'story', 'right', 'Found', 'alive', 'well', 'same', 'two', 'men', 'tried', 'let', 'Rodriguez', 'know', 'just', 'how', 'influential', 'music', 'had', 'been', 'entire', 'generation', 'record', 'sold', 'so', 'low', 'make', 'notice', 'states', 'had', 'sold', 'over', '500,000', 'South', 'Africa', 'alone', 'was', 'only', 'natural', 'same', 'fans', 'got', 'Rodriguez', 'come', 'Cape', 'Town', 'perform', 'same', 'fans', 'perform', 'did', '6', 'sold', 'out', 'shows', 'crowds', 'thousands', 'people.The', 'story', 'Rodriguez', 'was', 'interesting', 'enough', 'inspire', 'director', 'film', 'success', 'film', 'was', 'enough', 'interest', 'folks', '60', 'MINUTES', 'who', 'did', 'piece', 'story', 'only', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'giving', 'spoilers', 'here', 'review', 'truth', 'just', 'hearing', 'story', 'just', 'knowing', 'what', 'happened', ""n't"", 'near', 'interesting', 'amazing', 'learn', 'watching', 'movie.As', 'musician', 'will', 'be', 'many', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'crazy', 'song', 'guess', 'when', 'movie', 'finished', ""'ll"", 'be', 'tapping', 'toe', 'several', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'looking', 'CD', 'Rodriguez', 'same', 'time', ""'ll"", 'wonder', 'why', 'career', 'did', ""n't"", 'skyrocket', 'here', 'just', 'who', 'produced', 'albums', 'thought.The', 'tale', 'Rodriguez', 'one', 'will', 'touch', 'heart', 'have', 'amazed', 'man', 'today', 'What', 'newfound', 'success', 'revealed', 'end', 'film', 'saddest', 'thing', 'could', 'happen', 'people', 'not', 'discover', 'music', 'Rodriguez', 'man', 'beautiful', 'film', 'tale', 'well', 'will', 'hold', 'interest', 'start', 'finish']",N/A

Thank God it didn't though.Like all great prophets and brilliant people, he needed to be heard. Luckily, miraculously, he was heard. And he was heard by exactly the right people at the right time. It is stories like this that make you believe in a greater force in the universe. One that makes things happen when they need to happen, and as subtle as that force may be at times, it truly is magnificent and inspiring.Rodriquez was a Detroit musician during the 60's. During that time he cut two albums that were expected to make a big splash in the industry, but ended up fizzling out. Although the producers and people on the Detroit music scene thought he was going to be the next big American rock star, it never developed. Well, not in the states at least.Through a series of incredibly hard to believe coincidences, a bootlegged copy of his album Cold Fact made it's way to South Africa, wound up all over the radio, and against all odds ended up being inspiration for a social uprising in South Africa. Rodriguez's music and message was all about rebelling and going against the grain. At the time, that was what the people of South Africa needed.Overnight Rodriguez became a mysteriously popular rock star. No body in South Africa knew him, they didn't know where he lived, and had no idea where the music came from, but he grew to be bigger than the Stones, bigger than Elvis, and bigger than the Beatles in South Africa. To them he was a musical God and was the best that had ever lived. ""Jimi who?""Urban legends began spreading and rumors grew about the myth that was Rodriguez. The only theory that ever seemed plausible to them was that Rodriguez had died. This was the album he made right before he died and that was it. For a few fans though, this wasn't enough. They needed to know about Rodriguez's life and who he was. They didn't settle for anything but the truth, and this documentary is their wonderful search for the musical God of their life.

1550364,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B008CP2E7C,mirasreviews,"[1, 1]","""Searching for Sugar Man"" was made by first-time Swedish filmmaker Malik Bendjelloul about the quest by two South African music fans to find out what happened to a hero of their youth, an American musician called ""Rodriguez"" who made two folk-rock albums in the 1970s, then was rumored to have died by suicide. Stephen ""Sugar"" Segerman wrote some liner notes for the 1996 re-release of Rodriguez' second album ""Coming from Reality"" (1971) on CD. Though Rodriguez had been immensely popular in 1970s South Africa and an inspiration to the anti-apartheid and Afrikaans music movements, no one there knew any more about him than was written on the album cover. With little to go on, Segerman asked for information in his liner notes. South African music journalist Craig Bartholomew-Strydom, also an avid fan of Rodriguez, took up the challenge and tried to track down information on Rodriguez through the supply chain for his albums.The two men would both have success, but the project would turn out very differently that they had imagined. That's what makes ""Searching for Sugar Man"" so compelling. It's a surprising, almost magical story that could not have happened in today's internet-connected world. Nevertheless, it did happen a short time ago, and it's a real crowd-pleaser. The film has a great soundtrack too, featuring fourteen of Rodriguez' original songs, including ""Sugar Man"", the song of the title. This is one of those rare films that will send people straight out to buy the soundtrack. Director Malik Bendjelloul worked on a shoestring budget and even shot some scenes with his iPhone, doing the illustrations and editing himself. After four years of work on the film, he ran out of money and was at risk of leaving an unfinished project. But now the film is a minor hit and nominated for an Academy Award. There's a bit of fairy tale in that story too.Though its director may have been inexpert, ""Searching for Sugar Man"" is well-constructed, engaging and inspiring. It does leave some questions lingering, however: Rodriguez was also a big hit in Australia and toured there in 1979 and 1981. He played to sixteen sold-out concert halls. The film doesn't mention that. And why did Sussex Records drop Rodriguez before his third album was completed if the albums were selling well in other parts of the world? The producers of his first two albums were disappointed by US sales, but did they not know that foreign sales were respectable? The explanation may be that sales did not exist in Australia or South Africa until the mid-1970s, by which time Sussex Records was out of business. Was part of the confusion over the success of these albums abroad and over royalties due to the fact that Sussex Records folded in 1975? ""Searching for Sugar Man"" focuses on the South African story.The DVD (Sony 2013): The only bonus feature is a theatrical trailer.

So what is so different about admittedly talented Sixto Rodriguez, a cross between Bob Dylan and Jose Feliciano?  For one thing, although he hardly sold a record in the U. S.(he made 2 albums in 1970 & 1971),  he was bigger than Elvis or The Beatles in apartheid South Africa.Since there was so little known about Rodriguez - rumor was he was dead - a couple fans decided to try to find him or at least something about him.  Stephen `Sugar' Segerman, Dennis Coffey and Mike Theodore begin the detective work and filmmaker Malik Bendjelloul documents it all in this brisk 86 minute film.  As unlikely as it was, Rodriguez was never aware of his overseas popularity and evidently neither was anyone else.  South Africa was ostracized by most of the world for their racial segregation, so not a lot of information came in or went out.  The state controlled the media and media access.As Rodriguez songs became popular and controversial for their content, the government even censored certain tracks by scaring the vinyl.  As it turns out Rodriguez is found in a rundown house in a rundown neighborhood in rundown Detroit.  His ultimate coming out party in South Africa in 1998 is as unlikely as you could imagine.  The audiences went crazy.  He was as popular as anybody.  Although Rodriguez is touring again now, he still lives in the old house in Detroit and gives away his money to family and friends.  Although I was fascinated by this remarkable story, I kept wondering what ever happened to all the royalty checks the South African record companies sent to Rodriguez label back in the States.

To see the crowds go wild for him was amazing and emotional.  Someone likened it to having Elvis come to life and sing again.  He lived and raised his family in Detroit in near poverty, took his daughters to museums and concerts, did dirty, hard manual labor to make a living, all the while his records were selling hundreds of thousands of copies, for which he never saw a penny.

Last night it was The Imposter, this evening Searching for Sugar Man.The story of Sixto Rodriguez' accidental stardom in South Africa is every amateur songsmith's wildest dream come true. Having plugged away for years in front of unappreciative hometown crowds - in Rodriguez' case, having given it away altogether - to then discover you have been adored all along, by half a million fans, must be quite the trip. A trip, in this case, from inner-city Detroit in 1971 to Cape Town, South Africa, in 1998.Sixto Rodriguez was (if this film isn't really an elaborate hoax, a caveat you may take as read for the remainder of this review) a singer songwriter from Detroit who came to brief notice in the late sixties. He was picked up by a label which was part of the Motown empire. Perhaps his mistake was to ply Greenwich Village folk to the people of Motor City, but in any case his two recorded records sold not at all, and he was promptly dropped and passed quickly into oblivion.Or so he thought: But not, as it turned out, in South Africa, where his songs had spread by word of mouth and bootlegged cassettes. Under Apartheid this Mexican American folkie became an immense underground hit. South Africa was then a police state, so this is no mean feat, but perhaps explains why there was no greater communication in or out of the republic, for Rodriguez knew nothing of this success: he didn't know his record was even released in South Africa, because it wasn't: in a story as implausible as the one about American sailors donating 45s to Liverpudlian guttersnipes and thereby educating them about Chuck Berry, someone's girlfriend came over from LA with a copy, it got taped and passed around, and before long it had shifted half a million copies. Viral marketing, 1971 style.I checked with a South African compadre and it all seems to be true: his music (mostly a passable, if unremarkable, pastiche of Leonard Cohen or mid-sixties Dylan) is available on line. Still, vital things are not, or only half-, explained, such as how a few ropey C90s were converted into an officially released long playing vinyl record without interaction with the artist or his label, and where the money went: the film darkly hints at skulduggery amongst American impresarios, but never gets as far as pointing a finger.In any case, the film's first half centres on two South African fans and their quest to find out more about this artist. Common consensus in Capetown had it that Rodriguez was long since dead, a victim of on-stage suicide, variously by self immolation, gunshot or overdose. The fans (one of whom is nicknamed ""Sugarman"" after Rodriguez' song) set out to get to the bottom of how he died.*** spoiler alert ***It is difficult to talk about the second half of the film without giving away the spoiler that they do eventually find a trail back to Rodriguez, and he's not dead at all - but still working as a casual labourer in Detroit. Sixto's nearing sixty and has three daughters.It doesn't take long before he and his daughters are flying to South Africa for a concert tour. This last part of the film is an uplifting record of that triumphant tour, where over six nights he played to 30,000 hysterical fans. Really hysterical - Beatlemania style, mouthing every word of his lyrics. I dare say Leonard Cohen never had that.Throughout it all Rodriguez remains nonchalant: he takes it all in his stride, returning after each tour to his labouring job in Detroit, where his co-workers are most amused to find he is recording artist at all, let alone one with a huge following.*** spoilers over ***This is a gentle, amusing, poignant tale of a labour of love and the redemption of a man who is big enough not to have been disappointed by his life's trajectory, set against a story so remarkable you'll have trouble believing it to be true.

1550383,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B008CP2E7C,Paul Allaer,"[74, 76]","""Searching for Sugar Man"" (2012 release; 85 min.) brings the unlikely but true story of how, Rodriguez, an obscure American musician who released 2 never-heard albums in the early 1970s became a music sensation in South Africa. As a music nerd, this became even more compelling as I will admit I had never heard of Rodriguez before.The first half of the movie centers around the efforts of two South African men in the music business, both fan of and curious about the mysterious Rodriguez to simply find out more about this guy. The movie then traces the beginnings of Rodriguez in the late 60s in Detroit (with archive footage of the city at that time, not much better than it is now, just haunting) and how Rodriguez's 1970 debut album ""Cold Fact"" first became an underground hit in South Africa at the height of the apartheid regime (with songs like ""The Establishment Blues"") and eventually became a genuine hit album. It is about midway through the movie that we are introduced to Rodriguez himself, in present day, as he and the two South African men eventually hook up in 1997, and they now retell the story of what happened then. We see footage of Rodriguez coming to South Africa in early 1998, and the scenes we get to witness are almost beyond belief and description.Several comments: Rodriguez (who now must be in his early 60s I think) comes across as a humble, truly down to earth guy, unfazed (and not bitter in the slightest) about how his life has unfolded. (The movie notes at the end that he still lives in the same modest downtown Detroit house he has lived in for 40 years.) As to the quality of his music, a mix of James Taylor-meets-Bob Dylan-meets Jim Croce, it is quite good and it only demonstrates again how unpredictable the music industry is: why does one good artist break through but others do not? Nobody knows. But the most burning question that I have on my mind is this: after the events in 1998, why has it taken another 14 years to bring this improbable story to US audiences? That aside, this is the second must-see, can't miss documentary I've seen in the last week (the other one being ""The Imposter"", check that one out also by all means).

Rodriguez had a few decent songs, but nothing special, as most of these reviewers would have you believe.  His 2 original albums bombed in the U.S. for a very good reason - there's nothing special or extraordinary about them.  The comparisons of his writing to that of Bob Dylan makes me want to puke.  There were so many great artists in 1970 and by comparison, Rodriguez simply was not that good.  He isn't the first artist to have a couple of albums bomb and see their short-lived career in music end and he certainly will not be the last.  The story is uplifting and only brought to light because of his popularity in South Africa.

But this year a truly worthy film won the title. &#8220;Searching for Sugar Man&#8221; tells the story of psychadelic folk rock singer Sixto Rodriguez. Never heard of him? You&#8217;re not the only one. His first album &#8220;Cold Fact&#8221; (1970) sunk beneath the waves without a trace, despite being praised by critics as a masterpiece. His second album &#8220;Coming from Reality&#8221; (1971) met a similar fate: beloved by critics while inexplicably overlooked by the record-buying public. He was promptly dropped from his record label two weeks before Christmas and spent the next thirty years or so living near the poverty line on the mean streets of Detroit, working long hours at manual labor to raise his three daughters.What Rodriguez didn&#8217;t know is that through a strange twist of fate his two albums had somehow made it to South Africa shortly after he sank into musical oblivion. In the 1970s Rodriguez&#8217;s music became the soundtrack of a generation struggling against Apartheid and in this country of fifty million at the bottom of Africa he became a true superstar.And yet Rodriguez never saw a single penny in royalties.&#8220;Searching for Sugar Man&#8221; tells the story of how South African devotees of Rodriguez&#8217;s music finally found the singer living a quiet life in Detroit. (For years rumors had circulated among his legions of South African fans that he had committed suicide in the early 1970s.) In one scene a South African man nicknamed &#8220;Sugar&#8221; (guess why) finally speaks for the first time on the phone with Rodriguez. He tells Rodriguez that the singer is more famous than Elvis in South Africa and he invites &#8212; nay begs &#8212; Rodriguez to come visit his nation of adoring fans.So Rodriguez gets on a plane with his daughters and arrives at the airport in South Africa. There on the tarmac he sees three limousines. He thinks to himself, &#8220;Wow, those must be for somebody important.&#8221; Little does he know they are waiting for him. He arrives at the hotel and is ushered into the penthouse. But he opts to sleep on the couch because he doesn&#8217;t want the maid to have to make the bed the next morning. Then he is ushered onto the stage in front of thousands of screaming fans who have been singing his socially conscious songs for thirty years. And at long last this humble man who had spent his life quietly working for subsistence wages finds the legions of fans he never knew he had.In case you&#8217;re wondering, yes the royalties checks are now finally arriving. And as his daughters observe, he gives the money away as fast as he receives it.Jesus said the meek shall inherit the earth. In this case, at least, one of them also finally found his audience.randalrauser.com",5,The meek shall find their audience,1389052800,"01 7, 2014",2014,2829,"['Documentaries', 'typically', 'don', '8217', 'get', 'center', 'stage', 'Oscars', 'year', 'truly', 'worthy', 'film', 'won', 'title', '8220', 'Searching', 'Sugar', 'Man', '8221', 'story', 'psychadelic', 'folk', 'rock', 'singer', 'Sixto', 'Rodriguez', 'Never', 'heard', '8217', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'first', 'album', '8220', 'Cold', 'Fact', '8221', '1970', 'sunk', 'waves', 'trace', 'being', 'praised', 'critics', 'masterpiece', 'second', 'album', '8220', 'Coming', 'Reality', '8221', '1971', 'met', 'similar', 'fate', 'beloved', 'critics', 'inexplicably', 'overlooked', 'record-buying', 'public', 'was', 'promptly', 'dropped', 'record', 'label', 'two', 'weeks', 'Christmas', 'spent', 'next', 'thirty', 'years', 'so', 'living', 'poverty', 'line', 'mean', 'streets', 'Detroit', 'working', 'long', 'hours', 'manual', 'labor', 'raise', 'three', 'daughters.What', 'Rodriguez', 'didn', '8217', 't', 'know', 'strange', 'twist', 'fate', 'two', 'albums', 'had', 'somehow', 'made', 'South', 'Africa', 'shortly', 'sank', 'musical', 'oblivion', '1970s', 'Rodriguez', '8217', 's', 'music', 'became', 'soundtrack', 'generation', 'struggling', 'Apartheid', 'country', 'fifty', 'million', 'bottom', 'Africa', 'became', 'true', 'superstar.And', 'yet', 'Rodriguez', 'never', 'saw', 'single', 'penny', 'royalties.', '8220', 'Searching', 'Sugar', 'Man', '8221', 'story', 'how', 'South', 'African', 'devotees', 'Rodriguez', '8217', 's', 'music', 'finally', 'found', 'singer', 'living', 'quiet', 'life', 'Detroit', 'years', 'rumors', 'had', 'circulated', 'legions', 'South', 'African', 'fans', 'had', 'committed', 'suicide', 'early', '1970s', 'one', 'scene', 'South', 'African', 'man', 'nicknamed', '8220', 'Sugar', '8221', 'guess', 'why', 'finally', 'first', 'time', 'phone', 'Rodriguez', 'singer', 'more', 'famous', 'Elvis', 'South', 'Africa', '8212', 'begs', '8212', 'Rodriguez', 'come', 'visit', 'nation', 'adoring', 'fans.So', 'Rodriguez', 'plane', 'daughters', 'arrives', 'airport', 'South', 'Africa', 'tarmac', 'three', 'limousines', '8220', 'Wow', 'must', 'be', 'somebody', 'important.', '8221', 'Little', 'know', 'are', 'waiting', 'hotel', 'ushered', 'penthouse', 'sleep', 'couch', '8217', 'want', 'maid', 'have', 'make', 'bed', 'next', 'morning', 'Then', 'ushered', 'stage', 'front', 'thousands', 'screaming', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'singing', 'socially', 'conscious', 'songs', 'thirty', 'years', 'long', 'last', 'humble', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'spent', 'life', 'quietly', 'working', 'subsistence', 'wages', 'legions', 'fans', 'never', 'knew', 'had.In', 'case', '8217', 're', 'wondering', 'yes', 'royalties', 'checks', 'are', 'now', 'finally', 'arriving', 'daughters', 'observe', 'money', 'away', 'as', 'fast', 'it.Jesus', 'said', 'meek', 'shall', 'inherit', 'earth', 'case', 'least', 'one', 'also', 'finally', 'found', 'audience.randalrauser.com']",N/A

As a film, it's so-so, hitting very familiar notes.  Mostly this just made me lose whatever respect I might have had for South African musical tastes. It's a Bizarro world to be sure.

I was afraid that it just wouldn't be my kind of thing. Would I like the music? Probably not. Would I care about a musician that I had never previously heard of? Doubtful. Furthermore, only a select few documentaries have captured my imagination to the point where I would watch them more than once.I'm happy to report that all of my doubts were quickly erased within the first few minutes.Sixto Rodriguez was born in Detroit in 1942, and made two albums in the 1970s. The first, Cold Fact, was released in 1970, and Coming from Reality followed in 1971.His singing style was raw, along the lines of Bob Dylan and Neil Young. Like both of those artists, the lyrics carry a lot of meaning, and it's obvious that Rodriguez wrote songs that were both personal and authentic. His US sales were almost non-existent, and, like me, most people weren't aware that he existed before this documentary was put together.Here are a few of his lyrics:Climb Up on My MusicHave you ever had a feverFrom a bitter-sweet refrainHave you ever kissed the sunshineWalked between the rainWell, just climb up on my musicAnd my songs will set you freeWell, just climb up on my musicAnd from there jump off with meI'll Slip AwayAnd you can keep your symbols of successThen I'll pursue my own happinessAnd you can keep your clocks and routinesThen I'll go mend all my shattered dreamsMaybe today, yeah I'll slip awayThis is Not a Song, It's an Outburst: Or, The Anti-Establishment BluesThe mayor hides the crime rateCouncil woman hesitatesPublic gets irate but forget the vote dateWeatherman complaining, predicted sun, it's rainingEveryone's protesting, boyfriend keeps suggestingYou're not like all of the restGarbage ain't collected, women ain't protectedPoliticians using people, they've been abusingThe mafia's getting bigger, like pollution in the riverAnd you tell me that this is where it's atWoke up this morning with an ache in my headI splashed on my clothes as I spilled out of bedI opened the window to listen to the newsBut all I heard was the Establishment's BluesGun sales are soaring, housewives find life boringDivorce the only answer, smoking causes cancerThis system's gonna fall soon, to an angry young tuneAnd that's a concrete cold factThe pope digs population, freedom from taxationTeeny Bops are up tight, drinking at a stoplightMiniskirt is flirting, I can't stop so I'm hurtingSpinster sells her hopeless chestAdultery plays the kitchen, bigot cops non-fictionThe little man gets shafted, sons and monies draftedLiving by a time piece, new war in the far eastCan you pass the Rorschach test?It's a hassle it's an educated guessWell, frankly I couldn't care lessA couple of early interviews in the film report that Rodriguez committed suicide. One account states that he set himself on fire on stage, while another claims that he shot himself after his tiny audience ridiculed his performance. But this is not a sad tale; it's actually extremely uplifting. Please trust me on this.The film explains that Rodriguez was a huge success in South Africa, with a bigger following than Elvis or The Rolling Stones. He was completely unaware of this at the time, and never saw any of the money. His records were initially unavailable, but word spread after bootleg copies were distributed among fans. When the albums were finally released, more than half a million copies were sold. Imagine having all that success without being aware of it. It almost sounds like a hoax or a spoof documentary, doesn't it?In South Africa, people adopted some of the songs and made them part of the anti-apartheid movement. One fan decided to find out the truth about this mysterious man, and made it his mission to discover exactly what happened. He began by tracking where the royalties went, and also visited places mentioned in the songs. While on the verge of abandoning his search, a blog post gave him new hope and a fresh lead. I don't want to reveal what he ultimately found, because you deserve to find out for yourself if you don't already know how the story ends.This is a film for music fans, and for anyone who enjoys uplifting stories. I know that I haven't told you why you need to see Searching for Sugar Man, but you'll be glad you did if you do decide to check it out. It may be the best documentary I have ever seen, and I am already thinking about watching it again.It's not essential to view the film in high definition as much of the 1970s footage is low quality, but the recent interviews do benefit from the Blu-ray treatment, as does the sound quality.",5,Uplifting and almost unbelievable,1375574400,"08 4, 2013",2013,4673,"['had', 'read', 'so', 'many',

For a first film, Director Malik Bendjelloul , did an amazing job on virtually no budget. He used his life savings and even found himself creating the animation needed to recreate Rodriguez's early days in Detroit. Thanks to this life-affirming film the singer is now touring the world and his two albums and concert revenues are going to him. (The film never quite ""follows the money"" for the earlier royalties but I think that was done at Rodriquez' request.If you saw the film in a movie theater or as an Instant Video, I will highly recommend that you at least watch the DVD. The bonus features really ad to the enjoyment of the film. In addition to a feature length commentary by Rodrigues and the Director, there is a 25 minute ""Making of"" featurette that is not just full of scenes from the film. Ano0ther bonus is a 10 minute Q&A; filmed at the April 2012 Tribeca Film Fest which consists of Rodriguez performing one song live and then, with Bendjelloul, answering questions from the audience.No matter what your musical tastes this film will draw you in and keep you entertained for its 87-minute running time. Note that I watched the DVD but the DVD and Bluray versions contain the same bonuses. I'm not sure if the images are much sharper on the Bluray.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,GREAT film.

I was charmed by his daughters particularly his oldest and youngest as human beings, actually the whole family including Rodriguez struck me as very intelligent very literally and cultural adept people all the while boasting about being poor which alot of us are whether we want to admit that or not.  Anyway it's a very heart touching story to watch on this document.  My main concern is if this document will hold up on repeat viewings although i didn't check out the other features of the DVD i only watched the documentary and it was very good loved some of the shots of the places Rodriguez walked in South Africa and Detroit...loved the way he walks it seems it's a theme i seen him on 60 minutes and he did some walking in that documentary of 10-15 minutes...anyway if i'm a publisher i'd contact Rodriguez to write a book of poetry i checked out his music and he has some really mind blowing songs and he definitely was a writer of technique i don't think he just wrote those 24-30 songs and that was it he was writing a long time if you see the techniques and writing devices he used...had he continued writing or was on say Columbia where they could push for air-play we're talking a major songwriter in the Dylan, Cohen, Simon class...it's not to say they had the biggest hits (they did have them) but they were the most literary songwriters and Rodriguez goes into their class had he written 8-10 more albums, with just 2 he'll remain a what if wonder...but i won't take away anything from the most amazing story i've ever come across in terms of a musical artist, the only reason all this buzz is here because there was a buzz somehow for him in South Africa which has been estimated he sold 500,000 to 2 million copies...unfortunately all bootlegged and no royalty rates paid which the documentary covers all that and they did show his award for going platnium, maybe gold?  by now it's probably gone gold i'm sure of it.",5,Searching for Sugarman is incomplete,1358985600,"01 24, 2013",2013,2049,"['Far', 'documentary', 'complete', 'Searching', 'Sugar', 'Man', 'step', 'step', 'blow', 'was', 'charmed', 'daughters', 'particularly', 'oldest', 'youngest', 'human', 'beings', 'actually', 'whole', 'family', 'including', 'Rodriguez', 'struck', 'very', 'intelligent', 'very', 'literally', 'cultural', 'adept', 'people', 'while', 'boasting', 'being', 'poor', 'alot', 'are', 'want', 'admit', 'not', 'Anyway', 'very', 'heart', 'touching', 'story', 'watch', 'document', 'main', 'concern', 'document', 'will', 'hold', 'up', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'check', 'out', 'other', 'features', 'DVD', 'i', 'only', 'watched', 'documentary', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'loved', 'shots', 'places', 'Rodriguez', 'walked', 'South', 'Africa', 'Detroit', 'loved', 'way', 'theme', 'i', 'seen', '60', 'minutes', 'did', 'walking', 'documentary', '10-15', 'minutes', 'anyway', 'i', ""'m"", 'publisher', 'i', ""'d"", 'contact', 'Rodriguez', 'write', 'book', 'poetry', 'i', 'checked', 'out', 'music', 'really', 'mind', 'blowing', 'songs', 'definitely', 'was', 'writer', 'technique', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'just', 'wrote', '24-30', 'songs', 'was', 'was', 'writing', 'long', 'time', 'see', 'techniques', 'writing', 'devices', 'used', 'had', 'continued', 'writing', 'was', 'say', 'Columbia', 'where', 'could', 'push', 'air-play', ""'re"", 'talking', 'major', 'songwriter', 'Dylan', 'Cohen', 'Simon', 'class', 'not', 'say', 'had', 'biggest', 'hits', 'did', 'have', 'were', 'most', 'literary', 'songwriters', 'Rodriguez', 'class', 'had', 'written', '8-10', 'more', 'albums', 'just', '2', ""'ll"", 'remain', 'what', 'wonder', 'i', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'anything', 'most', 'amazing', 'story', 'i', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'come', 'terms', 'musical', 'artist', 'only', 'reason', 'buzz', 'here', 'was', 'buzz', 'somehow', 'South', 'Africa', 'been', 'estimated', 'sold', '500,000', '2', 'million', 'copies', 'unfortunately', 'bootlegged', 'royalty', 'rates', 'paid', 'documentary', 'did', 'show', 'award', 'going', 'platnium', 'maybe', 'gold', 'now', 'probably', 'gone', 'gold', 'i', ""'m"", 'sure']",N/A

It is nothing short of magical.Here's a remarkable artist who made beautiful, heartfelt music that didn't do anything in the US but helped the young people of South Africa find the courage to challenge apartheid. He never knew. He gave up on a music career and vested his energies on raising some beautiful children who seem as gentle and kind as he is.Many people have compared his sound to Bob Dylan's but I found him to be a little more like Donovan. His lyrics are profoundly moving and transcendant. It does something good for your soul to know that somewhere in this universe, someone had a dream - someone more than worthy - more than talented - and it touched millions of lives and in the end, a genuinely worthy person sees a dream realized. He is a beautiful person who makes beautiful music. Yes. I loved this movie. I loved how so many people never gave up on this man. Despite obfuscation by his record label, he wasn't bitter.

He recorded an album in 1970 called `Cold Fact' it was instantly adored by the critics and very fair comparisons were made about him to Bob Dylan.  It was then roundly ignored by record buyers. Undeterred he recorded a second album which followed the same trajectory as album one. Album three was not to be as the record company decided to drop him, just before Christmas.Meanwhile in a record store over in South Africa we have a story of a legend who has died in mysterious circumstance and a man who made it his mission to find out the truth about his unsung American hero. Rodriguez and his anti establishment attitude, easily accessible lyrics and effortless vocal style had made him an underground hit in apartheid struck South Africa. He was seen as a man who spoke for those who saw segregation as an unnecessary evil. His records had not only been banned but defaced by the authorities so that the offending material could never be played on air. Instead it took off underground, even with bootleg tapes etc. Then they heard he had shot himself, then he had burnt himself and the mystery of the man behind the shades deepened.This documentary tells of the amazing story to find a man that had inspired a nation but who never knew about it. It features a lot of his music and some live performances, and it is just inspirational. I am going to order his records after hearing some of them in the film. This is one of those films that you will want to tell your friends about, it has that rare quality of being a true story that you feel just has to be made up, but is all the more brilliant because it isn't.

These records went nowhere, and apparently the gifted artist disappeared. Later, someone in South Africa during the apartheid era heard these songs, which went on to become very popular in the country, but no one there knew anything about Rodriguez. Some say he committed suicide. What happened to him?Malik Bendjelloul's Oscar-winning documentary ""Searching for Sugar Man"" is a journey of two South African fans Stephen Segerman and Craig Bartholomew to find the answer. The journey is not only interesting but moving and thought-provoking, even though you already know the answer. (There is actually one unanswered question in the film, which makes it all the more intriguing.)What makes this film special is the great music of Rodriguez that you can hear in the film. Somehow fame eluded him just like many other gifted artists, but not now. Just listen to 'Cold Fact,' his debut album (from Sussex Records created by Clarence Avant, who is interviewed).

1550430,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B008CP2E7C,Turfseer,"[1, 2]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'Searching for Sugarman' is a documentary about a one-of-a-kind story that will never happen again. It's both bizarre and unusual as well as inspirational and uplifting.Back in the early 70s, a young folk-rock artist named Rodriguez (aka Sixto Rodriguez), put out two record albums which went nowhere on the U.S. charts. Faced with the prospect of supporting his family, Rodriguez gave up his musical career and became a construction worker, settling down in Detroit.Unbeknownst to him, those two albums made their way to South Africa, where he became a sensation amongst opponents of the Apartheid regime. In South Africa, through the 70s and 80s, Rodriguez was considered ""bigger than Elvis"". Somehow, no one in South Africa learned anything about Rodriguez and a rumor that he had killed himself on stage, became accepted as fact.In the late 90s, a couple of musicologists in South Africa began making inquiries out of curiosity, as to Rodriguez's history. After a long, frustrating search with no concrete results, one of those searching for their unknown idol, came upon a reference to Dearborn (Michigan) in the errant troubadour's lyrics. One clue led to another and before you knew it, the South African investigator was able to locate Rodriguez's first producer.To his amazement, the producer shocked his inquisitor by informing him that Rodriguez was still alive. Soon Rodriguez's daughter got in contact with the South African researchers, and filled them in as to her father's history.The great part of the film is that Rodriguez was invited to play live concerts in South Africa. His daughter commented that they expected a small group to show up but were completely flabbergasted when a sold-out crowd of thousands, showed up for her father's concert. Rodriguez himself, was amazed at the reverential reception that was given to him, but wasn't at all nervous, playing before all these adoring fans.How this unknown musician in the US, could have been such a sensation in South Africa, without anyone here in the US knowing about it, seems bizarre, in the age of the internet. But of course, all this happened before the internet was introduced.Most of those in the music business who had tried to make Rodriguez into a household name, were mystified as to why he never took off in the US. My opinion is that despite a great, unusual voice (in the spirit of Cat Stevens) and some catchy tunes and thoughtful lyrics, his arrangements seem a bit dated and corny (even back then). With what sound like synthesized strings, most of the songs hark back to the early 60s, with Rodriguez trying to meld a Dylanesque sensibility with Motown. It comes off as a bit old-fashioned and did not appeal to an audience who were more enthralled with the unencumbered folk or pop rock, that was popular at the time.We learn at the end of the documentary that Rodriguez went back to South Africa three more times, for more live concerts. We also learn that Rodriguez was extremely generous, giving most of the proceeds of those concerts to his friends and family. Rodriguez never received any royalties for all the sales of his music in South Africa, and it appears both bootleggers and a few unscrupulous music producers back in the US were to blame.I was a little disappointed that Rodriguez never really found his muse later on, and hasn't taken up composing again. His inspiration was squarely grounded in his youth. The love for his music in South Africa remains, as the denizens of that country feel a great nostalgia for their own youth, where they recall their exciting days of protest, against an oppressive political and social system.This is a real 'feel-good' story which will make you smile as an extraordinary man is given his due, later in life, when he least expects it.",4,"Inspirational tale of 70s musician who fails to make it in US, but finds unexpected redemption in South Africa",1372291200,"06 27, 2013",2013,3822,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', ""***'Searching"", 'Sugarman', 'documentary', 'one-of-a-kind', 'story', 'will', 'never', 'happen', 'again', 'bizarre', 'unusual', 'as', 'well', 'inspirational', 'uplifting.Back', 'early', '70s', 'young', 'folk-rock', 'artist', 'named', 'Rodriguez', 'aka', 'Sixto', 'Rodriguez', 'put', 'out', 'two', 'record', 'albums', 'went', 'nowhere', 'U.S.', 'charts', 'Faced', 'prospect', 'supporting', 'family', 'Rodriguez', 'gave', 'up', 'musical', 'career', 'became', 'construction', 'worker', 'settling', 'down', 'Detroit.Unbeknownst', 'two', 'albums', 'made', 'way', 'South', 'Africa', 'where', 'became', 'sensation', 'amongst', 'opponents', 'Apartheid', 'regime', 'South', 'Africa', '70s', '80s', 'Rodriguez', 'was', 'considered', 'bigger', 'Elvis', 'Somehow', 'one', 'South', 'Africa', 'learned', 'anything', 'Rodriguez', 'rumor', 'had', 'killed', 'stage', 'became', 'accepted', 'fact.In', 'late', '90s', 'couple', 'musicologists', 'South', 'Africa', 'began', 'making', 'inquiries', 'curiosity', 'Rodriguez', 'history', 'long', 'frustrating', 'search', 'concrete', 'results', 'one', 'searching', 'unknown', 'idol', 'came', 'reference', 'Dearborn', 'Michigan', 'errant', 'troubadour', 'lyrics', 'One', 'clue', 'led', 'knew', 'South', 'African', 'investigator', 'was', 'able', 'locate', 'Rodriguez', 'first', 'producer.To', 'amazement', 'producer', 'shocked', 'inquisitor', 'informing', 'Rodriguez', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'Soon', 'Rodriguez', 'daughter', 'got', 'contact', 'South', 'African', 'researchers', 'filled', 'father', 'history.The', 'great', 'part', 'film', 'Rodriguez', 'was', 'invited', 'play', 'live', 'concerts', 'South', 'Africa', 'daughter', 'commented', 'expected', 'small', 'group', 'show', 'up', 'were', 'completely', 'flabbergasted', 'when', 'sold-out', 'crowd', 'thousands', 'showed', 'up', 'father', 'concert', 'Rodriguez', 'was', 'amazed', 'reverential', 'reception', 'was', 'given', 'was', ""n't"", 'nervous', 'playing', 'adoring', 'fans.How', 'unknown', 'musician', 'US', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'sensation', 'South', 'Africa', 'anyone', 'here', 'US', 'knowing', 'bizarre', 'age', 'internet', 'course', 'happened', 'internet', 'was', 'introduced.Most', 'music', 'business', 'who', 'had', 'tried', 'make', 'Rodriguez', 'household', 'name', 'were', 'mystified', 'why', 'never', 'took', 'off', 'US', 'opinion', 'great', 'unusual', 'voice', 'spirit', 'Cat', 'Stevens', 'catchy', 'tunes', 'thoughtful', 'lyrics', 'arrangements', 'seem', 'bit', 'dated', 'corny', 'even', 'back', 'then', 'what', 'sound', 'synthesized', 'strings', 'most', 'songs', 'hark', 'back', 'early', '60s', 'Rodriguez', 'trying', 'meld', 'Dylanesque', 'sensibility', 'Motown', 'off', 'bit', 'old-fashioned', 'did', 'not', 'appeal', 'audience', 'who', 'were', 'more', 'enthralled', 'unencumbered', 'folk', 'pop', 'rock', 'was', 'popular', 'time.We', 'learn', 'end', 'documentary', 'Rodriguez', 'went', 'back', 'South', 'Africa', 'three', 'more', 'times', 'more', 'live', 'concerts', 'also', 'learn', 'Rodriguez', 'was', 'extremely', 'generous', 'giving', 'most', 'proceeds', 'concerts', 'friends', 'family', 'Rodriguez', 'never', 'received', 'royalties', 'sales', 'music', 'South', 'Africa', 'bootleggers', 'few', 'unscrupulous', 'music', 'producers', 'back', 'US', 'were', 'blame.I', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'Rodriguez', 'never', 'really', 'found', 'muse', 'later', ""n't"", 'taken', 'up', 'composing', 'again', 'inspiration', 'was', 'squarely', 'grounded', 'youth', 'love', 'music', 'South', 'Africa', 'denizens', 'country', 'feel', 'great', 'nostalgia', 'own', 'youth', 'where', 'recall', 'exciting', 'days', 'protest', 'oppressive', 'political', 'social', 'system.This', 'real', ""'feel-good"", 'story', 'will', 'make', 'smile', 'extraordinary', 'man', 'given', 'due', 'later', 'life', 'when', 'least']",N/A

Finally I watched it not knowing anything about it other than that it had high ratings in rottentomatoes and amazon.  WOW!!!  I believe it's much better viewing when you know very little about the story of Rodriguez.  My emotions went on a roller-coaster ride and at times I couldn't believe how much this movie affected me.  By the end I had tears streaming down my face and could not remember a film that made me feel this way.  It's times like these when filmmakers are at their best.

I just did not see the comparisons to Bob Dylan or anything that great about the music snipets played here...and I was really trying. This stuff reminded me of the cheap music from the Pickwick label that bordered on muzak. Don't remember that record label or the music? Then why should you bother with this stuff?There have always been plenty of &#34;common man&#34; musicians out there...Jim Croce, Harry Chapin, Ritchie Havens, Joni Mitchell, Joan Armatrading, Phoebe Snow, Nina Simone... to name a few. During that late sixties-early seventies period, there were a lot of big and innovative changes going on in rock and roll music and this stuff just wasn't cutting it. Sure, Rodriguez seems like a nice enough man, with a nice family now, but at the time, he was trying to break into a cut throat business with plenty of talented carnage and one hit wonders being thrown to the wayside.A big clue in this film is revealved in that Rodriguez doesn't seem to have written anything new since his failed short career as an American pop star. So he was a big hit in South Africa and he made some money doing a re-hash tour of 30 year old tunes there. Does that warrant a feature length documentary? I get the distinct impression that this movie was put together by a small group of people who are trying to create some fake hype to grift on a not so interesting topic. Obviously it worked because they got my $2.99, which is more than I would have paid had I known better.
