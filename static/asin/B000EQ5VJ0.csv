WOEICS is my favorite animated series of all time, occasionally even better than the X-Men animated series that was popular around the same time as this.ACME detectives Ivy and Zack work on cases where they are on a nearly perpetual mission to apprehend and catch the 'uncatchable' criminal thief Carmen Sandiego. Together they must decipher the clues that she leaves behind in order for them to solve and recover stolen items especially of historic landmarks.This series is very educational for younger TV goers especially kids and teenagers and yet even for adults like myself as I was just entering adolescence when this series premiered in early 1994.Although catering to younger audiences, I am suprised that grandparents have found this to be very entertaining as many older people I know have actually told me that they loved this show. It goes to show how diverse it's fans really are.As of writing this review, animated TV series have declined back into banal garbage lacking any good character development and no innovation. WOEICS pushed the limits in animation and stands as a landmark series of the 1990s.This DVD is of the first season of the series and is highly recommended for all CS fans out there, wherever they are!",5,FINALLY!

977253,A1PEO80SRE0067,B000EQ5VJ0,"SideshowJazz1 ""jazzykid1-bookworm""","[0, 0]","I've played several computer games of the ""Carmen Sandiego"" franchise from when I was seven years old, and this disappointed me in the respect that ACME was portrayed very differently, without any recognizable computer game characters (I missed the ""Good Guides"" and Lynne Thigpen's portrayal of the Chief). But this made up for that for its original characters. The computerized Chief was not interesting to me. I felt he was mainly there for comic relief, which was very mediocre. However, both detectives were likable and relatable characters. They also are very different but work well together, and the relationship they have is also enjoyable, as their role as coworkers conflicts with their relationship as siblings.I think what really makes this DVD is Carmen herself. In the computer games, particularly ""...Great Chase Through Time"", Carmen was always very one-dimensional who had no other character besides ""smart globe-hopping thief that is against ACME"". In this, it is clear from the start that Carmen is not the stereotypical villain. Her main motive is boredom. She steals because she wants to be chased by the detectives, and hates to be upstaged. Carmen also seems to care about the wellbeing of her detectives, as she does save their lives a few times. When they are up against less moralistic criminals, she does sometimes help them. But analyzation of Carmen's character aside, I'll continue with the episode storylines.These early storylines portray the conflict in the traditional way and Carmen is more of a protagonist, even though there are a few occasions when the sides help each other. However, this would drive younger viewers crazy until the end, as Carmen's plans are mostly quite elaborate and it is difficult for even teenagers to understand her clues until they get more information.The main problem I have with this is the aspect of the ""Player"". While their short conversations with Carmen at the beginning and end are enjoyable, the detectives are such good characters in their own right, that the Player doesn't make much sense at all. Also, the animation is very simple, sometimes annoyingly so. Carmen also looks very different to her computerized counterpart. In spite of the coat and hat she still wears, she has black hair, not brown hair, which will confuse players of the computer games.However, I do advise people to buy this. It has great characters, interesting knowledge, and good storylines. ""Where On Earth Is Carmen Sandiego"" is a worthwhile TV show to watch more than once!",4,Considering...Educational And Fun,1328572800,"02 7, 2012",2012,2527,"[""'ve"", 'played', 'several', 'computer', 'games', 'Carmen', 'Sandiego', 'franchise', 'when', 'was', 'seven', 'years', 'old', 'disappointed', 'respect', 'ACME', 'was', 'portrayed', 'very', 'differently', 'recognizable', 'computer', 'game', 'characters', 'missed', 'Good', 'Guides', 'Lynne', 'Thigpen', 'portrayal', 'Chief', 'made', 'up', 'original', 'characters', 'computerized', 'Chief', 'was', 'not', 'interesting', 'felt', 'was', 'mainly', 'there', 'comic', 'relief', 'was', 'very', 'mediocre', 'However', 'detectives', 'were', 'likable', 'relatable', 'characters', 'also', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'work', 'well', 'together', 'relationship', 'have', 'also', 'enjoyable', 'role', 'coworkers', 'conflicts', 'relationship', 'siblings.I', 'think', 'what', 'really', 'DVD', 'Carmen', 'computer', 'games', 'particularly', 'Great', 'Chase', 'Through', 'Time', 'Carmen', 'was', 'always', 'very', 'one-dimensional', 'who', 'had', 'other', 'character', 'smart', 'globe-hopping', 'thief', 'ACME', 'clear', 'start', 'Carmen', 'not', 'stereotypical', 'villain', 'main', 'motive', 'boredom', 'be', 'chased', 'detectives', 'be', 'upstaged', 'Carmen', 'also', 'care', 'wellbeing', 'detectives', 'save', 'lives', 'few', 'times', 'When', 'are', 'up', 'less', 'moralistic', 'criminals', 'sometimes', 'help', 'analyzation', 'Carmen', 'character', 'aside', ""'ll"", 'continue', 'episode', 'storylines.These', 'early', 'storylines', 'conflict', 'traditional', 'way', 'Carmen', 'more', 'protagonist', 'even', 'are', 'few', 'occasions', 'when', 'sides', 'help', 'other', 'However', 'would', 'drive', 'younger', 'viewers', 'crazy', 'end', 'Carmen', 'plans', 'are', 'mostly', 'quite', 'elaborate', 'difficult', 'even', 'teenagers', 'understand', 'clues', 'get', 'more', 'information.The', 'main', 'problem', 'have', 'aspect', 'Player', 'short', 'conversations', 'Carmen', 'beginning', 'end', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'detectives', 'are', 'such', 'good', 'characters', 'own', 'right', 'Player', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'Also', 'animation', 'very', 'simple', 'sometimes', 'annoyingly', 'so', 'Carmen', 'also', 'very', 'different', 'computerized', 'counterpart', 'spite', 'coat', 'hat', 'still', 'black', 'hair', 'not', 'brown', 'hair', 'will', 'confuse', 'players', 'computer', 'games.However', 'do', 'advise', 'people', 'buy', 'great', 'characters', 'interesting', 'knowledge', 'good', 'storylines', 'Where', 'Earth', 'Is', 'Carmen', 'Sandiego', 'worthwhile', 'TV', 'show', 'watch', 'more', 'once']",N/A
