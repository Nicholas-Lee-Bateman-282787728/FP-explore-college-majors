There was another movie like this but I can't recall it's title).In any event, George Burns is a howl in the role of the old man, and it makes me want to go rent the first movie in this series (""18""), although I haven't been able to find it anywhere.

It would be the last time he appeared on the big screen in a leading role.There were a bunch of similar movies released in a short period of time, where the older man and the younger guy switch bodies.  This was one of the best; it still holds up as a funny film.  Touching, too, as the love between Grandfather (Burns) and Grandson (Charlie Schlatter) is handled very realistically.Burns, as Jack Watson, doesn't have nearly as much screen-time as Charlie Schlatter, who plays Jack's grandson David.  The body switching occurs during a car accident that lands Burns unconscious in the hospital for the middle section of the film.  Burns expresses his thoughts through voice-over narration while experiencing life in his grandson's body.As much as this is George Burns's movie through and through, much credit must be given to Charlie Schlatter.  Schlatter very convincingly emulates Burns as a young man.  Red Buttons portrays Burns best friend, and Pauly Shore portrays Schlatter's best friend.The DVD is pretty much bare bones.  We are given a widescreen presentation along with the film's original theatrical trailer.  For the budget price, Burn's fans can't go wrong.
