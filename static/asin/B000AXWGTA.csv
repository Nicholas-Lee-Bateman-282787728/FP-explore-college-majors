934200,A2HHAV29CZ1OIE,B000AXWGTA,TheProf,"[74, 76]","This is where Nicole Kidman got an early start!I grew up watching the videotapes of File Mile Creek. This is a unique alternative to the wild West of America. It is set in the Australian Outback during the height of the gold rush. The series is loosely based on the Louis L'Amour book, The Cherokee Trail. This is a great family mini-series and the characters are so interesting.Kate and Maggie run Five Mile Creek, the waystation for the coach line. They are aided by Paddy, the Irish doom-and-gloom blacksmith; Ben, the horse wrangler from the States; Hannah, Maggie's preteen daughter; and Sam, an orphan taken in by Kate. Con and Jack are partners in the coachline, the Australian Express. Their fussy banker, Charles Withers, keeps the purse strings tight. (Later, we are introduced to Nicole Kidman as the sheep herder, Annie. But this is in one of the last seasons.)The episodes included in Season One are:Making Tracks- We are introduced to the people who will make up the crew of the Australian Express coachline and the Five Mile Creek waystation. Maggie and her daughter, Hannah, arrive in Australia in search of her wayward husband. Con Madigan arrives with the coach to meet his Australian partner, Jack Taylor. And Kate Wallace is abandoned and left to run the waystation all by herself.Horses for Courses- Learning to live in a wilderness & getting the coachline off and running.Love Before a Fall- Life is complicated by stolen gold and a mysterious drifter, for whom Kate falls in love with.A Few Surprises- Jack contracts a deadly fever that can only be cured by a native potion.The Scrub Bulls- Jack & Con look to expand the business but have to deal with a stubborn squatter. Maggie's school is off and running as she learns a terrible secret about her husband.Bang the Big Drum- A naive peddler comes through the area and the ladies go shopping.Gold Fever- Gold fever sweeps through the Five Mile Creek area bringing prospectors and the worst lawbreakers, ""bushrangers.""Annie- A pregnant woman goes into labor at Five Mile Creek, complicating Maggie's life as she deals with her husband's sudden re-appearance.Home and Away- Maggie has to decide whether to stay in Australia or return home.The Awakening- Jack's first shipment of gold is stolen and Kate takes care of a very sick Aborigine family.The Prize- Jack and Con step into the boxing ring to secure a contract for the Australian Express.Tricks of the Trade- Bushrangers threaten a shipment of currency. Sam's foster parents arrive to take him. Kate is told she must be married in order to adopt him and a proposal comes from the unlikeliest of sources.Thanksgiving- The American holiday looms as Maggie gets word of a tragedy and a feud erupts between the partners.",5,Looking forward to this!,1125532800,"09 1, 2005",2005,2744,"['where', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'got', 'early', 'start', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'videotapes', 'File', 'Mile', 'Creek', 'unique', 'alternative', 'wild', 'West', 'America', 'set', 'Australian', 'Outback', 'height', 'gold', 'rush', 'series', 'loosely', 'based', 'Louis', ""L'Amour"", 'book', 'Cherokee', 'Trail', 'great', 'family', 'mini-series', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'interesting.Kate', 'Maggie', 'run', 'Five', 'Mile', 'Creek', 'waystation', 'coach', 'line', 'are', 'aided', 'Paddy', 'Irish', 'doom-and-gloom', 'blacksmith', 'Ben', 'horse', 'wrangler', 'States', 'Hannah', 'Maggie', 'preteen', 'daughter', 'Sam', 'orphan', 'taken', 'Kate', 'Con', 'Jack', 'are', 'partners', 'coachline', 'Australian', 'Express', 'fussy', 'banker', 'Charles', 'Withers', 'purse', 'strings', 'tight', 'Later', 'are', 'introduced', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'sheep', 'herder', 'Annie', 'one', 'last', 'seasons', 'episodes', 'included', 'Season', 'One', 'are', 'Making', 'Tracks-', 'are', 'introduced', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'make', 'up', 'crew', 'Australian', 'Express', 'coachline', 'Five', 'Mile', 'Creek', 'waystation', 'Maggie', 'daughter', 'Hannah', 'arrive', 'Australia', 'search', 'wayward', 'husband', 'Con', 'Madigan', 'coach', 'meet', 'Australian', 'partner', 'Jack', 'Taylor', 'Kate', 'Wallace', 'abandoned', 'left', 'run', 'waystation', 'herself.Horses', 'Courses-', 'Learning', 'live', 'wilderness', 'getting', 'coachline', 'running.Love', 'Fall-', 'Life', 'complicated', 'stolen', 'gold', 'mysterious', 'drifter', 'whom', 'Kate', 'love', 'with.A', 'Few', 'Surprises-', 'Jack', 'contracts', 'deadly', 'fever', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'cured', 'native', 'potion.The', 'Scrub', 'Bulls-', 'Jack', 'Con', 'look', 'expand', 'business', 'have', 'deal', 'stubborn', 'squatter', 'Maggie', 'school', 'running', 'terrible', 'secret', 'husband.Bang', 'Big', 'Drum-', 'A', 'naive', 'peddler', 'area', 'ladies', 'go', 'shopping.Gold', 'Fever-', 'Gold', 'fever', 'Five', 'Mile', 'Creek', 'area', 'bringing', 'prospectors', 'worst', 'lawbreakers', 'bushrangers', 'Annie-', 'A', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'labor', 'Five', 'Mile', 'Creek', 'complicating', 'Maggie', 'life', 'husband', 'sudden', 're-appearance.Home', 'Away-', 'Maggie', 'decide', 'stay', 'Australia', 'return', 'home.The', 'Awakening-', 'Jack', 'first', 'shipment', 'gold', 'stolen', 'Kate', 'care', 'very', 'sick', 'Aborigine', 'family.The', 'Prize-', 'Jack', 'Con', 'step', 'boxing', 'ring', 'secure', 'contract', 'Australian', 'Express.Tricks', 'Trade-', 'Bushrangers', 'threaten', 'shipment', 'currency', 'Sam', 'foster', 'parents', 'arrive', 'take', 'Kate', 'told', 'must', 'be', 'married', 'order', 'adopt', 'proposal', 'unlikeliest', 'sources.Thanksgiving-', 'American', 'holiday', 'Maggie', 'word', 'tragedy', 'feud', 'erupts', 'partners']",Five Mile Creek - The Complete First Season

934202,AO4CDJ583IY55,B000AXWGTA,Whitney,"[5, 5]","As most of the reviewers here probably can attest, there are few TV shows available that are fit for viewing, let alone for the whole family to watch. We don't have cable, and we often buy movies and TV series we enjoy, but finding something we haven't seen before is very difficult. While browsing the shelves at the library the other day, we ran across Five Mile Creek, and the complete first season was available. I have to admit, we weren't expecting much. Disney is not renowned for making movies or shows that are interesting (in my opinion), and these days, I'm pretty skeptical when I pick up anything ""new"" (meaning new to me). But then, we popped the first disc into the DVD player and this quaint story emerges that grows on you with every episode. I was not wild about the pilot. It was decent and fairly interesting, but each episode gets better and better, and by the end of the season, we were hooked. I got on the internet to see if I could buy the second and third seasons because we so want to know what happens to the gang at Five Mile Creek, and I was extremely disappointed to find that they never released the following seasons to this charming series. So, please, on behalf of the loyal fan base of this delightful show (which seems to be a steady and growing one with new interest well after the 20 years since the finale) release the sequential two seasons on DVD so we can all travel to Five Mile Creek to visit with this unique family who have so subtly and gently captured our hearts.",4,A Distinct and Surprising Treasure,1307145600,"06 4, 2011",2011,1512,"['most', 'reviewers', 'here', 'probably', 'can', 'attest', 'are', 'few', 'TV', 'shows', 'available', 'are', 'fit', 'viewing', 'let', 'alone', 'whole', 'family', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'cable', 'often', 'buy', 'movies', 'TV', 'series', 'enjoy', 'finding', 'something', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'very', 'difficult', 'browsing', 'shelves', 'library', 'other', 'day', 'ran', 'Five', 'Mile', 'Creek', 'complete', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'available', 'have', 'admit', 'were', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'Disney', 'not', 'renowned', 'making', 'movies', 'shows', 'are', 'interesting', 'opinion', 'days', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'skeptical', 'when', 'pick', 'up', 'anything', 'new', 'meaning', 'new', 'then', 'popped', 'first', 'disc', 'DVD', 'player', 'quaint', 'story', 'grows', 'episode', 'was', 'not', 'wild', 'pilot', 'was', 'decent', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'episode', 'better', 'better', 'end', 'season', 'were', 'hooked', 'got', 'internet', 'see', 'could', 'buy', 'second', 'third', 'seasons', 'so', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'gang', 'Five', 'Mile', 'Creek', 'was', 'extremely', 'disappointed', 'find', 'never', 'released', 'following', 'seasons', 'charming', 'series', 'So', 'please', 'behalf', 'loyal', 'fan', 'base', 'delightful', 'show', 'be', 'steady', 'growing', 'one', 'new', 'interest', 'well', '20', 'years', 'finale', 'release', 'sequential', 'two', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'can', 'travel', 'Five', 'Mile', 'Creek', 'visit', 'unique', 'family', 'who', 'have', 'so', 'subtly', 'gently', 'captured', 'hearts']",Five Mile Creek - The Complete First Season
