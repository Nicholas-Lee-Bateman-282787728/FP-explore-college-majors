But, to really understand it, first you have to be from Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia or Bosna/Herzegovina. Second, you must be smart and intelligent enough to see through it and third, you must not have dear friends and family killed in a war.That's a pretty tall order, I know...At first sight, the movie looks as pure Milosevic's propaganda and it's obvious why is that. It was the only way it could get made. But the authors were smarter, so they did what Verhoeven did with &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;- an all-out SF action for the masses and clever satire for the classes.The story revolves around two friends (a Serb and A Muslim) who end up on different sides in the war (naturally), one being sieged by the other (both with their troops) in the unfinished tunnel of &quot;Brotherhood and Unity&quot; (excellent parallel, watch out for many more) somehwere in Bosnia... Terror, despair, friendship turned sour, people fooled by propaganda... All come out through the memories of better times for all peoples of the Balkans.The telling of the story is rather complex, but you'll get it on your second or third viewing, if you can stomach it. Some scenes are quite disturbing, so watch out. This is not for children at all...",5,"Excellent, but troubling...",994204800,"07 4, 2001",2001,1319,"['first', 'rate', 'war', 'movie', 'right', 'there', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'really', 'understand', 'first', 'have', 'be', 'Croatia', 'Serbia', 'Slovenia', 'Bosna/Herzegovina', 'Second', 'must', 'be', 'smart', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'see', 'third', 'must', 'not', 'have', 'dear', 'friends', 'family', 'killed', 'war.That', 'pretty', 'tall', 'order', 'know', 'first', 'sight', 'movie', 'pure', 'Milosevic', 'propaganda', 'obvious', 'why', 'was', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'get', 'made', 'authors', 'were', 'smarter', 'did', 'what', 'Verhoeven', 'did', 'quot', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'quot', 'all-out', 'SF', 'action', 'masses', 'clever', 'satire', 'classes.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'two', 'friends', 'Serb', 'A', 'Muslim', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'different', 'sides', 'war', 'naturally', 'one', 'being', 'sieged', 'other', 'troops', 'unfinished', 'tunnel', 'quot', 'Brotherhood', 'Unity', 'quot', 'excellent', 'parallel', 'watch', 'out', 'many', 'more', 'somehwere', 'Bosnia', 'Terror', 'despair', 'friendship', 'turned', 'sour', 'people', 'fooled', 'propaganda', 'come', 'out', 'memories', 'better', 'times', 'peoples', 'Balkans.The', 'telling', 'story', 'rather', 'complex', ""'ll"", 'get', 'second', 'third', 'viewing', 'can', 'stomach', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'so', 'watch', 'out', 'not', 'children']","Pretty Village, Pretty Flame"

The movie was passed up for theatrical distribution, although it was readily available on VHS and now on DVD from Fox Lorber.This DVD is a bust in every thinkable way, although Fox Lorber was obviously aiming very low.  The phrase ""bare-bones"" is usually used to describe discs that are given rudimentary, dismissive releases, lacking supplements that more presumably marketable titles might warrant.  This DVD does contain a trailer, but the trailer, sadly, looks better than the feature.  ""Bare-bones"" would have been fine, but watching this disc is torture.It's obviously a quickie transfer from the VHS -- I could have produced a better amateur transfer -- with a loud hiss tainting the soundtrack throughout, poor audio balance (with dialogue pulsing between speakers in an artificial echo) poor contrast, a muddy, dark image, burnt-in subtitles, and so forth.  Fox Lorber were long the scourge of the art-film DVD market, and their soulless neglect of their titles has never been more apparent than in this disc.  New Yorker and Wellspring (formerly Winstar) are guilty of similar offenses.",1,A great film given the basest possible DVD treatment from Fox Lorber,1119744000,"06 26, 2005",2005,1272,"['Most', 'who', 'were', 'lucky', 'enough', 'see', 'stunning', 'Srdjan', 'Dragojevic', 'film', 'select', 'film', 'festivals', 'U.S.', 'have', 'not', 'forgotten', 'clarity', 'anger', 'power', 'movie', 'was', 'passed', 'up', 'theatrical', 'distribution', 'was', 'readily', 'available', 'VHS', 'now', 'DVD', 'Fox', 'Lorber.This', 'DVD', 'bust', 'thinkable', 'way', 'Fox', 'Lorber', 'was', 'obviously', 'aiming', 'very', 'low', 'phrase', 'bare-bones', 'usually', 'used', 'describe', 'discs', 'are', 'given', 'rudimentary', 'dismissive', 'releases', 'lacking', 'supplements', 'more', 'presumably', 'marketable', 'titles', 'might', 'warrant', 'DVD', 'contain', 'trailer', 'trailer', 'sadly', 'better', 'feature', 'Bare-bones', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'watching', 'disc', 'obviously', 'quickie', 'transfer', 'VHS', 'could', 'have', 'produced', 'better', 'amateur', 'transfer', 'loud', 'hiss', 'tainting', 'soundtrack', 'poor', 'audio', 'balance', 'dialogue', 'pulsing', 'speakers', 'artificial', 'echo', 'poor', 'contrast', 'muddy', 'dark', 'image', 'burnt-in', 'subtitles', 'so', 'forth', 'Fox', 'Lorber', 'were', 'long', 'scourge', 'art-film', 'DVD', 'market', 'soulless', 'neglect', 'titles', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'apparent', 'disc', 'New', 'Yorker', 'Wellspring', 'formerly', 'Winstar', 'are', 'guilty', 'similar', 'offenses']","Pretty Village, Pretty Flame"
