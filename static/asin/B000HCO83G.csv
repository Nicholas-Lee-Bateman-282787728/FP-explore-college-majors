1012252,A2EJCIVTCBN9R0,B000HCO83G,1954strat,"[1, 2]","Normally I like to give only good ratings (to good movies). This movie however, is so dreadful that I feel compelled to warn others of it. Void of the director Bryan Singer, (director of the first two X-Men) This movie ranks at the bottom of the barrel of the Marvel Super Hero movies. First of all, you don't just start killing off X-Men, especially Professor X ( or is he really dead?) And if he is not dead, why kill him off in the first place? They did a horrible job portraying Jean Grey as Dark Phoenix. Nothing at all like the comic book. It did not come close to doing her character justice. Even though I enjoy the villain Magneto, why is it that he has to appear as the main villain in every single X-Men movie? There are plenty of other great villains to go around. One of the very best X-Men stories and X-Men villains was The Juggernaut. If new director Brett Ratner had done this right, The Juggernaut as the main villain could have been the best X-Men movie ever. Instead, Ratner decides to portray The Juggernaut as a 3rd class villain, basically a campy goof as if he were appearing as a henchman in The original Batman TV series from the mid 1960's. What a shame and what a waste. Because of this, it is highly unlikely that The Juggernaut will ever be taken seriously going forward. The only good thing about this movie is the evolution of Storms hair. But even her stunning looks are not enough to breath life into this extremely dissappointing third installment. In the meantime, we can only pray for the return of Bryan Singer.",1,X-men III Review,1336262400,"05 6, 2012",2012,1549,"['Normally', 'like', 'give', 'only', 'good', 'ratings', 'good', 'movies', 'movie', 'however', 'so', 'dreadful', 'feel', 'compelled', 'warn', 'others', 'Void', 'director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'director', 'first', 'two', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'bottom', 'barrel', 'Marvel', 'Super', 'Hero', 'movies', 'First', 'all', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'start', 'killing', 'X-Men', 'especially', 'Professor', 'X', 'really', 'dead', 'not', 'dead', 'why', 'kill', 'off', 'first', 'place', 'did', 'horrible', 'job', 'portraying', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'Dark', 'Phoenix', 'Nothing', 'comic', 'book', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'close', 'doing', 'character', 'justice', 'Even', 'enjoy', 'villain', 'Magneto', 'why', 'appear', 'main', 'villain', 'single', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'great', 'villains', 'go', 'around', 'One', 'very', 'best', 'X-Men', 'stories', 'X-Men', 'villains', 'was', 'Juggernaut', 'new', 'director', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'had', 'done', 'right', 'Juggernaut', 'main', 'villain', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'ever', 'Instead', 'Ratner', 'portray', 'Juggernaut', '3rd', 'class', 'villain', 'basically', 'campy', 'goof', 'were', 'appearing', 'henchman', 'original', 'Batman', 'TV', 'series', 'mid', '1960', 'What', 'shame', 'what', 'waste', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'Juggernaut', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'going', 'forward', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'evolution', 'Storms', 'hair', 'even', 'stunning', 'looks', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'breath', 'life', 'extremely', 'dissappointing', 'third', 'installment', 'meantime', 'can', 'only', 'pray', 'return', 'Bryan', 'Singer']",N/A

That is I thought the evolution of the movie's rules and causality would change by whim.  Instead, we get a ""rock/ paper/ scissors"" approach.  Each superhero has their own connecting powers, like one has fire and another has ice.  In this installment, the mutants find there is a cure for their powers, which some make into a crusade, others a curse.  There is a societal divide; one that breaks out with signs and protestors, but, unfortunately, like real life, it is too often resolved with violence.  (Will this be the fate of stem cell research, and was this something they had in mind for the movie's theme?)  Anyway, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Phoenix (Famke Jensen) have a consequential love affair that has global--or at least environmental--consequences.  The visual effects throughout are stunning and Storm (played skillfully by Halle Berry) and others give us capable performances for the plot's urgency.  Stately figures like Magneto (Ian McKlellen) and Sir Henry (Kelsey Grammer) give some weightiness to the story's edge.  Interesting and eye-popping, 'X-Men- The Last Stand' is impressive--even for a ""newbie"" like me.  Storm leaves us with words to live by at slain Professor X's funeral, ""We live in an age of darkness--a world full of hate, fear, and intolerance. In every age there are those who try to fight it.""

1012256,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000HCO83G,A Customer,"[5, 9]","Big on explosions and shouting, and lots of gratuitous running, the third X-Men installment features some of the most jaw-dropping special effects, with director Brett Ratner repeatedly slamming his actors around or leaving them stranded. This film is loud and over-blown and mostly features Famke Janssen, as Jean, the class-5 mutant who has unparalleled powers and seems intent to take over the film and everyone around her as she becomes a fearless demolisher.The megalomaniac Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen), with his clipped British accent is still plans to wage war on humans and he releases Jean's strengths as a destroyer, Whilst the hunky Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) can still recover from any wound and continue to perform his sort of beefy and muscled action hero shtick. And Storm (Halle Berry) well and truly kicks butt in her fight with the speed/blink lady and spins like a top as she ascends to nowhere.Anna Paquin stands around looking a bit blank as though the writers just can't decide what to do with her, and the stunning Rebecca Romijn, as Mystique, in body-fitting blue scales - the most openly erotic image in recent middle-of-the-road cinema, and by far the most interesting character - is quickly killed off. There are lots of secondary X-men all fighting with each other; consequently the film feels so over-bloated with characters that it's almost impossible to keep up.The problem is the hokey script, which seems to be flailing around to try and find anything for the large number of primary and secondary characters to do. I guess all the actors are contracted to do a certain number of films in the series, that's why it comes across as such a huge cast bloat.  And after the first thirty minutes of cars and houses ascending into the air, it all becomes rather loud and silly.In this installment, a chemical cure for mutancy has been found; the President of the United States (Josef Sommer) supports it, but almost none of the mutants want to be ""cured.""  Of course, it doesn't take rocket science to figure out that the mutancy is actually a metaphor for homosexuality; consequently the mutants make the plea to be left alone to cultivate their otherness rather than be forcibly merged into the bland mediocrity of humankind.The essential theme of a marginalized minority fighting for their rights is always compelling, but the noble storyline is soon abandoned in favor of multiple explosions and people being blown away, cars are flung up in the air and set on fire, and so on - it's all designed for fifteen year-old boys in mind.Ratner's movie is one thudding climax after another, and it left me absolutely exhausted - and somewhat bored - just the way the second and third movies in the Matrix series did. Lets just hope that this installment is definitely the ""last stand"" for this series.

But I have to say -- it's really frustrating when they reduce almost all the newer characters to mere cameos... They just tease you with a little bit of special FX to illustrate their powers, but then fail to do *anything* with the character for the entire movie.

All too often the problem arises from the egos of those involved in the acting.  Such is sadly the case with X-MEN: THE LAST STAND.  Someone got sidetracked and decided that minor characters should all of a sudden be major players, ""mutating"" the story in ways that, in the end, destroy the dramatic value that might have been possible had things been left alone.Enter Halle Berry.  Apparently she must have felt that her role as Storm was far too minor.  No doubt her insane argument was, ""Hey, I've got an Oscar, I'm the greatest, I'll call the shots now and don't you forget it!"" But don't take my word for it. Read the original comic books. Look at the original character and story balance there. Storm was never more than a bit player and, all things considered, the stories were better off as a result.  So what the heck happened here?  Every time the scene changes, there's Halle Berry on screen. She dices, she slices, she makes frozen yogurt. And to make matters considerably worse her lines are contrived, stilted and pathetically acted.  And don't get me started on her ridiculous hairdo.

1012275,A18SLX1JESM0EX,B000HCO83G,A reviewer in Atlanta,"[8, 10]","You know, I'm just so tired of the movies that take a comic book franchise, create characters with the names and traits from the book, then completely rewrite everything else about it.  I refrained from saying anything about the first 2 movies, but now it's just borderline ludicrous.I saw one reviewer refer to Rogue as one of the weakest characters ever, yet in the comics she is one of the most powerful.  My wife kept asking me to help provide some backstory for certain characters and I had to say, ""Honey, I don't know.  Other than the names and the powers, nothing else is the same.""  I saw characters killed that, to my knowledge, have never been killed off in the comic.  It's been a few years since I read the books, but aren't Professor X and Juggernaut closely related?  I was thinking they were brothers, yet there's no recognition when they come face to face.  Some of the earliest X-Men in the books who were the mentors are the young students in the movies.  And don't even get me started on the origin of the Dark Phoenix.  In the comics, the Phoenix was an alien being but here it's the result of a split personality created by the manipulations of Professor X.  In fact, the way things develop in the movie, Professor X is almost as evil in his actions as Magneto.I continue to be disappointed in the screen development of Marvel comics.  While the DC characters tend to be mostly true to the comics (Superman, Batman), Marvel seems to take great delight in discarding years of comic history and rewriting everything.  The most successful movies are those where they left most of it intact, such as Spiderman.  The dregs are those where they tampered too much, like Daredevil.X-Men is visually stunning.  Special effects are well done.  If you don't know the comics, the storyline is acceptable.  In fact, I think I would've enjoyed this movie much more if it had the same type of story and characters, but had not called them the X-Men.  If you expect to see the characters from the comics on the big screen, you're in for a disappointing ride.

1012276,ADFLPF6FI3W0O,B000HCO83G,ASP,"[0, 1]","I watched the Blu-ray version of this movie and it looked great visually, but the movie lacked substance.First off, Brett Ratner's vision of Xmen 3 was so terrible that it equates to Joel Schumacher's vision of Batman & Robin. Yes, Xmen 3 is the Batman & Robin of the Xmen Universe.Xmen 3 was not very good. Yes there is a lot of action, but it's pointless and without a cohesive story. The movie had 13 different plots going on at the same time and none of the plots actually came together, and if two or three did, they were done terribly. The dialogue was bad.If you know anything about Xmen, you cannot bring the entire series to a close in 1 and half hours. The first two movies in the series spent so much time developing the characters and story. Xmen 2 was done really well, combining story and action successfully. Brett Ratner's Xmen 3 was all action and no substance.The characters who were strongly developed in the previous two movies didn't exist for long in the third movie (Cyclops and Rogue). The third part should have been split into TWO different 2 hour long movies if they wanted to end the series.And now for my personal view: Stupid, terrible new characters were introduced. The casting wasn't that great for the new characters. It is possible to make a great Marvel/super hero movie while staying true to the ORIGINAL material that made it so famous in the firstplace. See Ironman. See Dark Knight.  Keep it serious as the source material is of a serious nature.Xmen 3 as a movie is a far cry from the original source material, didn't mind the leather suits at all, but the stories seemed like a young high school student wrote it.

1012277,A2NZ6ZFXDD48P7,B000HCO83G,Athenaeus Alexander Dukas,"[2, 3]","On the whole, X-Men 3: The Last Stand fulfilled my expectations but it was not without some fairly significant problems which I'll mention here before moving on to what did work...The first and biggest problem is that the score by composer John Powell is ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS.  In no way, whatsoever, does it tie into the EXCELLENT Michael Kamen X1 score (Which was VERY SOLID!) nor the SOARING John Ottman X2 score (Which, like the movie it supports, is easily the best of the three!) which had some degree of overlap and drew from the same core melodic well.  This new soundtrack makes no sense thematically, is not appealing in the slightest, and basically takes the audience hostage every time it rears it's ugly head because in addition to totally sucking it also is just TOO BIG for the film.  Additionally, even when the acting and story are synchronized, which is most of the time, the music actually desynchronizes the audience from what's happening.They also managed to TOTALLY screw-up the sequencing of the opening credits so they don't look great and are in the wrong order which makes for yet another distraction.  IT IS SUPPOSED TO GO LIKE THIS: 1) opening credits, then 2) through the security scanning eye of Cerebro, and then 3) to the flashback, and then 4) move forward to the present.  It's a small but glaring detail that fans will notice.  Try and imagine Star Wars without the Lucasfilm Insignia, the ""a long time ago in a galaxy far, far, away..."" thing,  and the episode's opening crawl?  It matters!The second problem is the pacing.  The film moves much too fast and it's isn't nearly long enough.  The acting and story are good but they are trying to do WAAAY too much in WAAAY too little time and the film seems to lack the more quiet and contemplative moments which defined the first two films between bursts of action.  It's not impossible to work with but it is rather ""jarring"" to behold: an X-Men Movie strung-out on crack and that is stuck pedal-to-the-medal on Fast-Forward!The third problem is some story/acting/applied super-power inconsistencies.It was perfectly obvious (at the end of X2) that Xavier was aware that Jean had faked her death in order go solo for a while and to pursue the development of her powers to their full-potential without the distraction of her dual-attraction to Scott/Logan and without Xavier keeping her reined-in.  He gives a solid (if fairly lame-ass) explanation for how Jean might have survived and -- though it is an explanation that film fans and fans of the comics will laugh with and enjoy -- it doesn't seamlessly interlock with the first two movies as well as it could/should nor does it make a lot of sense continuity-wise when it's perfectly obvious that Xavier KNEW that Jean had survived.The most glaring (And VERY surprising!) inconsistency is how they portrayed Storm's power-of-flight in this movie.  Though the X-Men franchise has always been very good at stretching the boundaries of what is possible it has also been a franchise that obeys the laws of physics with reasonable levels of believability.  Storm's ability to fly upon the winds that she summons requires those winds to be of tremendous speed/lift/suction (Which is why she's called the Windrider!) and she doesn't just glide around like a weightless leaf as they showcase her doing in this movie.  Phoenix and Magneto can do that because their powers directly affect/override gravitational forces but Storm has no such ability and if they are going to have Storm fly they might try and make it more convincing because it would take a hell-of-a-lot more quickly moving air to keep Halle Berry's ass in the air than the pseudo-zero-gravity effect they used.  Also disturbing is the complete lack of The Phoenix Fire/Firebird Effect which was teasingly used and alluded to at the end of X2 when Jean lifts the jet while holding back the wall of water -- one of the greatest reinterpretations of a seminal event in comic book history.  Whether she was Balanced Healthy Phoenix or Dark Phoenix, The Phoenix Effect was ALWAYS on hand when Jean amped-up her powers.  It's UNBELIEVABLE that they wouldn't include it!Those problems aside, there are many things that were done VERY WELL...The Neutralizer Storyline + The Legacy Virus Storyline = The Synthesized Cure Storyline was an excellent instinctual choice and it works beautifully and with a minimum amount of set-up.Pretty much all the kids from the school that appeared in the previous two movies have returned giving it a very nice Harry Potter-like multi-generational consistency.  They were some nice casual moments like when Colossus is carrying a TV around the hallway which audiences are going to go wild over.  The NEW Kitty Pryde ABSOLUTELY ROCKS -- and it's a real shame that we didn't have her aboard sooner -- and all of the adult X-Men look and behave like they should.  Kelsey Grammer was an INSPIRED choice to play Beast and bringing-in Olivia Williams aboard to play Moira MacTaggert was also a very smart move even though she's a little bit too young for the part.The Dark Phoenix storyline was something of a let down because we didn't get to see the healthy side and miraculous application of Jean's Phoenix-enhanced powers first.  Going straight to Dark Phoenix may have been necessary but it watered things dows a bit since the Phoenix Saga had both ups and downs to it.  Beyond that, the final resolution is depressing though since Jean is Phoenix a resurrection is easily possible provided there are more films and the studio can bring Famke Janssen back to play Jean again.The film's ending is a mystery AND THERE IS A SCENE AT THE END OF THE CREDITS THAT YOU HAVE TO STAY FOR which leaves the door wide-open for a sequel and also raises some questions about what actually transpired during the psychic battle between Xavier and Phoenix.The love story between Jean/Logan/Scott is very nicely resolved and Jean & Logan FINALLY get the credit they deserve for being the hotter and more interesting of the two relationships.  When I was younger, I preferred Jean & Scott, until I grew-up, and realized that you need humor, passion, fun, and sexual attraction to have a healthy relationship and realized that Jean & Logan had always been the better pairing.  Jackman and Janssen's chemistry on-screen also made it difficult to buy a Jean & Cylops pairing since they had no heat.Fans will also delight in the battle sequences, the insults, the humor, and the distinctive characterizations.The movie could and should have been longer and better, but, it's done a good job of capping-off this first trilogy and it leaves the door open in a non-pressured/non-anvillicious way for future movies.",5,EXCELLENT FILM...

Well, the DVD comes in a nice box protected by a plastic sleeve with Wolverine's claw embossed on it. The box houses the DVD case with a nice little photo of the major characters in an ensemble shot. The comic is a little book with some reprinted X-stories and the much anticipated new story written by Stan Lee himself. Honestly, I don't plan on keeping the box or plastic sleeve. The comic is nice, though.Then there's the DVD which was kinda disappointing. After ""X-Men 1.5"" and ""X2: X-Men United"" I was expecting a bus load of behind the scenes documentaries and interviews. Especially with this being the last film in the X-Men trilogy. The deleted scenes and commentary are good along with a hidden ""easter egg"" scene featuring Beast reciting Shakespeare to encourage his teammates before going to war (found in the ""Scene Select"" option). Also, the viewer has the option of choosing the style of the menu to reflect the Brotherhoods' personality or the X-Men's. Also has a sneak peek at The Simpsons Movie which was another welcome surprise. Overall, it's a pretty skimpy DVD that will probably be released in a double disc ""Ultimate Edition"" format in the future to further capitalize on the X-Franchise.....""X-Men: The Second To Last Stand"" anyone?For those who don't know the plot it's basically three challenges for the X-Men to deal with in their latest adventure: the creation of a ""cure"" drug that can supress the mutant gene permanently, the aggressive response to the drug by Magneto and his new Brotherhood, and Jean Grey comes back from the dead in the guise of her malevolent alter ego Phoenix. The movie is a step above the typical summer blockbuster yet it lacks the sleek, sci-fi flavored, ""less is more"" style used in the first two films. The story also suffers from plot-overload. The Phoenix, Magneto's Brotherhood and The Cure are just too much for one movie and it shows. So, for action and blockbuster fans this is definitely a must have. And X-Fans will get a nice buzz from seeing some of their requests fulfilled such as an airborne Storm, Beast as a major character, and a Danger Room sequence.Though I highly doubt this will be the last X-Men film it is an ambitious finale to a unique and memorable trilogy.",4,One Disc Short,1159920000,"10 4, 2006",2006,2398,"['bought', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'X3', 'just', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'shelling', 'extra', 'dollars', 'snazzy', 'box', 'nifty', 'gifts', 'Well', 'DVD', 'nice', 'box', 'protected', 'plastic', 'sleeve', 'Wolverine', 'claw', 'embossed', 'box', 'houses', 'DVD', 'case', 'nice', 'little', 'photo', 'major', 'characters', 'ensemble', 'shot', 'comic', 'little', 'book', 'reprinted', 'X-stories', 'much', 'anticipated', 'new', 'story', 'written', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'Honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'plan', 'keeping', 'box', 'plastic', 'sleeve', 'comic', 'nice', 'DVD', 'was', 'kinda', 'disappointing', 'X-Men', '1.5', 'X2', 'X-Men', 'United', 'was', 'expecting', 'bus', 'load', 'scenes', 'documentaries', 'interviews', 'Especially', 'being', 'last', 'film', 'X-Men', 'trilogy', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'are', 'good', 'hidden', 'easter', 'egg', 'scene', 'featuring', 'Beast', 'reciting', 'Shakespeare', 'encourage', 'teammates', 'going', 'war', 'found', 'Scene', 'Select', 'option', 'Also', 'viewer', 'option', 'choosing', 'style', 'menu', 'reflect', 'Brotherhoods', 'personality', 'X-Men', 'Also', 'sneak', 'peek', 'Simpsons', 'Movie', 'was', 'welcome', 'surprise', 'Overall', 'pretty', 'skimpy', 'DVD', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'released', 'double', 'disc', 'Ultimate', 'Edition', 'format', 'future', 'further', 'capitalize', 'X-Franchise', '..', 'X-Men', 'Second', 'Last', 'Stand', 'anyone', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'plot', 'basically', 'three', 'challenges', 'X-Men', 'deal', 'latest', 'adventure', 'creation', 'cure', 'drug', 'can', 'supress', 'mutant', 'gene', 'permanently', 'aggressive', 'response', 'drug', 'Magneto', 'new', 'Brotherhood', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'back', 'dead', 'guise', 'malevolent', 'alter', 'ego', 'Phoenix', 'movie', 'step', 'typical', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'yet', 'sleek', 'sci-fi', 'flavored', 'less', 'more', 'style', 'used', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'story', 'also', 'plot-overload', 'Phoenix', 'Magneto', 'Brotherhood', 'Cure', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'one', 'movie', 'So', 'action', 'blockbuster', 'fans', 'definitely', 'must', 'have', 'X-Fans', 'will', 'get', 'nice', 'buzz', 'seeing', 'requests', 'fulfilled', 'such', 'airborne', 'Storm', 'Beast', 'major', 'character', 'Danger', 'Room', 'highly', 'doubt', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'X-Men', 'film', 'ambitious', 'finale', 'unique', 'memorable', 'trilogy']",N/A

There's a lot in it to please the fans of Marvel comics, especially old-timers like me. (I read my first Marvel comic in 1963, when I was in the 3rd grade.) This is the darkest of the three films and is operatic and tragic in its style. The battle sequences are many, and the fight choreography is graceful and spectacular--a tribute to the art of Jack Kirby, who is the Michaelangelo of graphic artists. Fans will especially love Kelsey Grammer in the role of The Beast. Professional reviewers thought he was a rediculous choice, but old-time fans will see him as perfect. Other standout perfomances are the great Ian McKellan as Magneto (his voice and delivery are hypnotic) and the marvelous Australian Vinnie Jones as the ruthless and powerful Juggernaut. The relationship between Wolverine and Jean Grey is the element that moves the story, and is what brings us to the great climax of the film.

The theme of tolerance has always been part of the X-Men universe, but in this edition the idea gets beaten into the viewers head over and over again like one long public service announcement.  After a while one tires of the message and longs for senseless violence to drown out the constant preaching.  Fortunately, the senseless violence arrives in the form of a climatic battle at a pharmaceutical company located on Alcatraz Island.  The antagonist mutants are able to get to the island only after Magneto picks up the Golden Gate Bridge and turns it so that it connects directly to Alcatraz.  While this is visually stunning and one of the best examples of CG in the movie, one wonders how a suspension bridge that is 1.7 miles long can extend to an island that is almost 3 bridge lengths away without one end or the other falling into the bay, but facts don't need to get in the way of a good old fashioned cinematic beat-down.  A few more of the comic book X-Men and women make their big screen debut, a few previously seen mutants make all too brief cameos and there are a few surprising deaths and other strange fates that befall the legion of super humans.  Ian McKellen again does a stellar job portraying the conflicted enemy mutant, Magneto, and Patrick Stewart does a fine job as Prodessor Charles Xavier.  The Action is strong and never ending and the effects are fairly crisp and believable.  A final showdown between Wolverine and his love interest [Jean Grey/Phoenix]is almost detail for detail the same as a crucial scene from Buffy the Vampire Slayer season 2, but for the most part the film is a good combination of Marvel lore and original writing.  It probably rates somewhere beneath X-Men 2 though I doubt too many comic book fans will be displeased with it.",4,Third Installment is Thrilling and Entertaining,1150416000,"06 16, 2006",2006,1983,"['third', 'perhaps', 'last', 'installment', 'X-Men', 'franchise', 'exciting', 'thrilling', 'previous', '2', 'lack', 'class', 'almost', 'subtlety', 'predecesors', 'theme', 'tolerance', 'always', 'been', 'part', 'X-Men', 'universe', 'edition', 'idea', 'beaten', 'viewers', 'head', 'over', 'again', 'one', 'long', 'public', 'service', 'announcement', 'while', 'one', 'message', 'longs', 'senseless', 'violence', 'drown', 'out', 'constant', 'preaching', 'Fortunately', 'senseless', 'violence', 'form', 'climatic', 'battle', 'pharmaceutical', 'company', 'located', 'Alcatraz', 'Island', 'antagonist', 'mutants', 'are', 'able', 'get', 'island', 'only', 'Magneto', 'up', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', 'directly', 'Alcatraz', 'visually', 'stunning', 'one', 'best', 'examples', 'CG', 'movie', 'one', 'how', 'suspension', 'bridge', '1.7', 'miles', 'long', 'can', 'extend', 'island', 'almost', '3', 'bridge', 'lengths', 'away', 'one', 'end', 'other', 'falling', 'bay', 'facts', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'get', 'way', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'cinematic', 'beat-down', 'few', 'more', 'comic', 'book', 'X-Men', 'women', 'make', 'big', 'screen', 'debut', 'few', 'previously', 'seen', 'mutants', 'make', 'too', 'brief', 'cameos', 'are', 'few', 'surprising', 'deaths', 'other', 'strange', 'fates', 'befall', 'legion', 'super', 'humans', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'again', 'stellar', 'job', 'portraying', 'conflicted', 'enemy', 'mutant', 'Magneto', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'fine', 'job', 'Prodessor', 'Charles', 'Xavier', 'Action', 'strong', 'never', 'ending', 'effects', 'are', 'fairly', 'crisp', 'believable', 'final', 'showdown', 'Wolverine', 'love', 'interest', '[', 'Jean', 'Grey/Phoenix', ']', 'almost', 'detail', 'detail', 'same', 'crucial', 'scene', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'season', '2', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'good', 'combination', 'Marvel', 'lore', 'original', 'writing', 'probably', 'rates', 'somewhere', 'X-Men', '2', 'doubt', 'too', 'many', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'displeased']",N/A

There was a change of directors between the first two films and this one, and it shows. This movie also made the mistake that the first two didn't - it introduced way too many mutants with not enough time to properly flesh them out. So why did I like this movie...Well... here is where I'm probably going to get heat.This is purely MY opinion, but I never liked Cyclops... at all. I cringe when people say, ""they should do an X-Men Origins on Cyclops!"" Ehhhh... So without spoiling anything, when Cyclops's screen time was 'cut short' I was very happy. Also, when Professor Xavier's screen time was 'cut short, I didn't object to that either. BUT DON'T GET ME WRONG! I love Xavier and he's one of my favorite guys, and it was a huge risk to do this in the story, but I believe that what happened in his scenario added a stronger sense of sadness and desperateness to win the battle and make 'The Last Stand'.The story was clever and it took a lot of risks. But my favorite thing about this movie was the action. We finally get to see Iceman cover his whole body in ice, Storm is a lot more powerful, and Magneto was the @*%$. Even with the action better, there were still some things I wished I could've seen.

Hired gun Brett Ratner tries to appease fans of Singer's work while adding a plethora of geekout moments for fan-boys to eat up. The plan backfires, however, as for every one of these moments that The Last Stand gets right, it gets at least two or three things wrong in character development, plot, and overall appeal. To start with, some major cast members are killed off, and surprisingly early on, too. This would be enough to anger fans of the comics and films alike but to make things worse, just about everyone in this movie acts out of character--Wolverine becoming the team leader and Professor Xavier turning into a control freak are but a couple examples. It also doesn't help that all the main story arches that have been developed so painstakingly by Singer are mostly ignored or completely dissolved here in favor of a few flashier and far shallower characters. Though the opening scene with Angel as a child is particularly moving, his character doesn't do anything of importance for the rest of the movie. The same could be said of countless others whose sole purpose is to look cool and provide a quick fight scene or one-liner. There are so many things wrong with X-Men: The Last Stand that to put them into a list would take days to complete. The only thing that can be said for it is that Brett Ratner is able to rely on the screenwriters to add in enough action-packed effects shots to keep people off the trail of just how much is lacking here.

But X-men movies have been the exception, because the X-men comics were my favorite back in the day and I thought the first two movies were great hero flicks.  Also it is said that X-men 3 is to be the last of the series, although a Wolverine spinoff is in the works.  Sadly I think X-men 3 finishes off the series on a low note.The movie starts off shortly after the events of XM2.  The X-men are back at the school licking there wounds after the death of Jean Grey.  It is revealed that a drug company has come up with a cure for mutants that would make them normal.  This of course is used by Magneto to recruit for his organazation (The Brotherhood) who wishes to launch a war against mankind.XM3 has a lot more action than the first two and racks up a impressively high body count along the way, but sacrifices plot and character developement along the way.  Wolverine gets his fair share of screen time, but most of the others are short changed, and in a few cases killed off fairly quickly.  The most interesting subplot for me of the last two movies has been the Iceman/Rogue romance.  At the beginning this promises to again be interesting as Rogue, who cannot touch another person without hurting them, considers taking the new mutant cure.  Sadly though this sub plot is not fully developed and Anna Paquin is mostly absent from this film.XM3 also adds several characters from the comic series including Angel, Beast, Collossus, Shadow Cat and various Morlocks and Marauders if I remember correctly. Only Beast, played by Kelsey Grammer gets any screen time. Most of the participation of the newbies is at the cameo level, and that is a bit sad because some of them are interesting characters, especially Kitty Pryde.Speaking of Kitty Pryde, Ellen Page does a wonderful job and steals what few scenes she has and Kelsey Grammer is also excellent as Beast.  The film does have a few interesting fight scenes but left me feeling a unsatisfied as I left the theatre.  In the end it is hard for me to imagine who will really enjoy this film a lot.  People who know nothing of the X-men world except the previous movies will be a somewhat lost by the parade of new characters.  I haven't read a X-men comic in close to 20 years and I saw some big inconsistencies so I have no idea how the fanboyz are going to take to this.

That's what you have with XMTLS. Fans who cheered in the theater during the second film when Wolverine killed the guy in the kitchen will get more than their fill of claw-slashing action.XMTLS is an incredible film and easily the best of the series. While it's true they probably tried to put too much into one short film (this is the shortest of the three for some reason with the largest cast), Ratner and company do an admirable job of pulling it off for the most part. While rumors abound this is the last one due to contract problems with certain ""Stormy"" stars, this film proves if nothing else that the X-Men universe can survive without the whole cast. There are enough heroes waiting in the wings to get treatments that we can afford to lose anyone not willing to return.The film pulls off some key moments in powerful ways. The problem is that it tries to pull off TOO MANY key moments and therefore loses the impact of most of them. Yes, we finally get to see the Danger Room. Yes, The Angel finally makes an appearance (for about ten minutes of film time). Yes, The Beast is every bit as cool in the movies as he is in the comics (Grammar does an amazing job of perfectly portraying Hank McCoy's intellect while pulling off some amazing fighting moves). And hey, they've thrown in Juggernaut, Colossus, Sprite, Psylocke, Madrox the Multiple Man, Arclight, Marrow, and Spike. And Iceman finally ""ices up""!What did they do wrong? In adding so many characters, there's not enough screen time for them. Rogue uses her powers ONCE early in the film when she could have been used in a great way during the climactic battle scene at the end. The death of a MAJOR character ten minutes into the film is only alluded to rather than shown (which is a rip since we've stuck with this person through two other films). Speaking of deaths, this film pulls out all the stops. The Xavier Institute's backyard goes from scenic to a graveyard in ONE FILM! Shouldn't we have spaced these out a little?Still, despite giving too much in too little time (this could have easily gone over the two hour mark without making anyone upset), this is the best film of the series. Hugh Jackman adds a depth to the character of Wolverine with one scene that truly shows how he's grown from the previous two installments. Storm becomes a central player to the team finally. And we see the Colossus/Wolverine ""Fastball Special"" from the comics. Ratner even throws in a little curve of his own after the credits finish rolling to show there could still be life in the franchise if anyone's interested. I'd say we definitely all are! Cut down the cast a little (for heaven's sake, lose Magneto! The ""Mutants are superior to Homo Sapiens"" routine has gotten too old and the guy's more of an irritation than a menace now), add some faces to give us more fun (Gambit could appear to add some spice to the Rogue/Iceman/Sprite love triangle), lengthen the movie (by at least a half hour to give us a breather between explosions), and keep giving Wolverine people to slash and we'll all be happy!

Based on what I saw in the theaters (I saw it 4 times!) there are a lot of good and bad things about this movie, mostly good. While it did stray from historic comic book plots and characters, what director Brett Ratner envisioned is a fine and acceptable, if not a really good, story.The story, special effects, and the acting were excellent.The story, while there are those who'll say otherwise, was really good. The X-men find out from The Secretary of Mutant Affairs, aka Beast, that there is a threat to mutant kind. A child, played by Cameron Bright, has the ""uncanny"" (pardon the pun) ability to ""leech"" any mutants powers. The effect is temporary and only while the mutant is within about 10-15ft from him. However the military uses the kid's blood to make (any guesses?) a weapon, of course. This causes a flurry of reactions from the mutant comunity. Some mutants want ""the cure"" some want it destroyed. I don't want to ruin the story so I'll just say it is a pretty acurate depiction of what would happen. I was kind of dissapointed that not any muntants from other Marvel series were involved. I thought it would be an excellent chance for some cross-over characters to make a few cameo apearances. While the comic book fanatics were freaking out about the differences from the movie to the comics, they were not paying atention to the really great story.The special effects were up to the same level, if not better, as the first 2 entries in this series. There is a really great scene where Beast, played by Kelsey Grammer (aka Frasier), reaches out to touch the Leech (C. Bright), and his hand becomes a normal looking human hand. There is also a scene that has Cyclops, played by James Marsden, blasting Alkalie Lake, where Jean Grey drowned. Also when the Phoenix is around...get ready for special effects to wow you.The acting was, as always when you have Patrick Stewart, superb. Everyone from Halle Berry, who plays Storm, to Vinnie Jones, who plays Juggernaut, did a fine job. I only can complain about one actor...Cameron Bright, who plays the Leech (the kid who has the negating power). He says about 3 words through the whole movie. From what I've seen of the kid he has played basically the same character in every movie he's been in. This small negative does not take away from the movie as a whole. He only has about 4 scenes anyway.All in all this is a fantasic movie. You must make it a point to watch the extra scenes at the end of the credits. A lot of story happens in those few scenes, and you don't want to miss them.",4,Make sure you watch the after-credits scenes.,1155340800,"08 12, 2006",2006,2646,"['everyone', 'else', 'writing', 'review', 'release', 'have', 'only', 'scene', 'theatrical', 'version', 'Based', 'what', 'saw', 'theaters', 'saw', '4', 'times', 'are', 'lot', 'good', 'bad', 'things', 'movie', 'mostly', 'good', 'did', 'stray', 'historic', 'comic', 'book', 'plots', 'characters', 'what', 'director', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'envisioned', 'fine', 'acceptable', 'not', 'really', 'good', 'story.The', 'story', 'special', 'effects', 'acting', 'were', 'excellent.The', 'story', 'are', 'who', ""'ll"", 'say', 'otherwise', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'X-men', 'find', 'Secretary', 'Mutant', 'Affairs', 'aka', 'Beast', 'threat', 'mutant', 'kind', 'child', 'played', 'Cameron', 'Bright', 'uncanny', 'pardon', 'pun', 'ability', 'leech', 'mutants', 'powers', 'effect', 'temporary', 'only', 'mutant', '10-15ft', 'However', 'military', 'kid', 'blood', 'make', 'guesses', 'weapon', 'course', 'flurry', 'reactions', 'mutant', 'comunity', 'mutants', 'want', 'cure', 'want', 'destroyed', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'story', 'so', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'pretty', 'acurate', 'depiction', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'was', 'kind', 'dissapointed', 'not', 'muntants', 'other', 'Marvel', 'series', 'were', 'involved', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'excellent', 'chance', 'cross-over', 'characters', 'make', 'few', 'cameo', 'apearances', 'comic', 'book', 'fanatics', 'were', 'freaking', 'out', 'differences', 'movie', 'comics', 'were', 'not', 'paying', 'atention', 'really', 'great', 'story.The', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'up', 'same', 'level', 'not', 'better', 'first', '2', 'entries', 'series', 'really', 'great', 'scene', 'where', 'Beast', 'played', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'Frasier', 'out', 'touch', 'Leech', 'C.', 'Bright', 'hand', 'normal', 'looking', 'human', 'hand', 'also', 'scene', 'Cyclops', 'played', 'James', 'Marsden', 'blasting', 'Alkalie', 'Lake', 'where', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'drowned', 'Also', 'when', 'Phoenix', 'around', 'get', 'ready', 'special', 'effects', 'wow', 'you.The', 'acting', 'was', 'always', 'when', 'have', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'superb', 'Everyone', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'who', 'Storm', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'who', 'Juggernaut', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'only', 'can', 'complain', 'one', 'actor', 'Cameron', 'Bright', 'who', 'Leech', 'kid', 'who', 'negating', 'power', '3', 'words', 'whole', 'movie', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'kid', 'played', 'basically', 'same', 'character', 'movie', 'been', 'small', 'negative', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'movie', 'whole', 'only', 'about', '4', 'scenes', 'anyway.All', 'fantasic', 'movie', 'must', 'make', 'point', 'watch', 'extra', 'scenes', 'end', 'credits', 'lot', 'story', 'happens', 'few', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss']",N/A

It is worth seeing but it lacks any of the fun that I saw in the first two movies. There is no lighthearted times in this movie. Usually in a trilogy the second movie is dark and the third movie starts that way but has a happy ending. There is no happy ending here, just a feeling of emptiness and loss. Is the action, effects, and story good? Yes they are in fact. So as I said before if you have caught the previous ones you will want to see it. However; this is not a standalone movie and won't make much sense without seeing the previous movies. Fans of the first two movies may be disappointed in the deaths of three key characters. If they had not killed off these characters and had a happier ending I think I know I would have enjoyed it more. And by the way the alternate endings are a joke. They are minor scene changes that were deleted, not a change to the ending itself. I was extremely disappointed that the alternate endings as they call them didn't have different outcomes. Preferably one that didn't kill off the characters. My guess is they had so many people disppointed in the movie they felt the only way to sell the DVD was to make people think they had alternate endings.

At Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, the mansion has been repaired after the commando incursion ofX2 - X-Men United (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition), and students of all sizes scurry through the halls at class-change time.  Even Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) seems to have settled in as part of the team, although in Danger Room simulations he still has a tendency to bend the rules.  But Scott Summers (James Marsden) is so consumed by grief over the death of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) that he's abdicated his position as leader, forcing Storm (Halle Berry) to step into the slot--a job she doesn't want.  And Magneto (Ian McKellen) remains at large and a matter of deep concern to the government.  Then Jean is unexpectedly resurrected from the depths of Alkali Lake.  But Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) fears what the strain of saving herself may have done to her Class 5 mutant powers.  Meanwhile, Warren Worthington II (Michael Murphy), head of a great pharmaceutical company, has announced the creation of a vaccine that can suppress--permanently--all mutant ability.  Despite assurances that taking it will be entirely voluntary, Magneto, that survivor of the Holocaust, fears what its existence may mean and begins assembling a mutant army called ""The Brotherhood.""  In the end, it's five Xavier students against a mass of raging outlaw mutants with a weapon that may mean the end of the world.This splendid climax to the X-Men trilogy is worth every cent of its cost, from the sensitive portrayals of inner conflict suffered by Wolverine, Xavier, Storm, and Jean to the thunderous John Powell score (X-Men:  The Last Stand (Original Motion Picture)) to the introduction of imaginative new mutant characters (including Ben Foster as Worthington's son/namesake, Angel, with his gorgeous 20-foot wingspan) to the stunning special effects.

I think the X-men is the richest of all the comic book superhero collections, when it comes to stories, characters and possibilities. Spiderman's the coolest, but X-men has numerous characters that deal with real issues that coincide with issues of the world... like mutantism/racism, fear of the unknown and stereotyping.So, now we have X-men: THE LAST STAND. What? Last stand?The first two X-men movies were outstanding, yet only scratching the surface of the stories that are to be told in the comic book series and its possibilities. The third and supposedly, FINAL film, couldn't possibly do the series justice if it ended the series now. I mean, what about APOCALYPSE, JUGGERNAUT, BLACK TOM, ERIC THE RED, the FOUR HORSEMEN, GAUNTLET, the HELLFIRE CLUB, STRYFE and the Mutant Liberation Front and of course the Sentinels.So, what did the creators of X-MEN: THE LAST STAND do? I'm still not sure. They took, what was the PHOENIX SAGA, or when Jean Grey returns from the dead as an even more powerful Mutant than she was, struggling to control her powers. They took the Phoenix Saga, rewrote it, and hit the fast forward button.Ultimately, we do get to see the Sentinels... for about 15 seconds. Their eyes shining through fog and one of their heads dropping to the ground... only to turn out being a simulator. Then we do get to meet JUGGERNAUT... again, seemingly just thrown in and not given any meaningful air time. We get to meet a bunch of random Mutants, seemingly created by the writers. None of which are of any note. Oh, and of course we get to see ANGEL in some brief scenes... dives out a window and flies away and then appears in the final scene briefly. Colossus, vaguely used. Again, all these cool characters... just basically given a reference and not explored.Oh, I almost forgot about the introduction of BEAST, played by Kelsey Grammar.

1012306,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000HCO83G,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 5]","It's good to know that a comic book adaptation can still show some degree of complexity. ""X-Men: The Last Stand""--the third and most likely final film in the series--transcends a lot of other superhero stories by presenting a meaningful, thought provoking story, one that parallels the reality of equality and acceptance. This is not just an emotionless gathering of highly choreographed action sequences; it goes deeper by presenting a genuine sense of morality and ethical issues. It accomplishes its task without getting satirical or preachy, while at the same time providing enough computer generated eye candy to remain entertaining.But for a film that provides a decent dose of humanity in the midst of stylized violence, it seems oddly incomplete. I think the meticulous attention to substance resulted in the neglecting of some crucial plot-advancing methods. For one, a couple of characters were introduced but never adequately defined. Take, for example, Warren Worthington III (Ben Foster). He's a mutant who has the ability to sprout majestic white wings and fly (appropriately giving him the nickname Angel). His father (Michael Murphy) is the head of a corporation that has discovered an antibody capable of altering the genetic structure of mutants, turning them mortal. In essence, a ""cure"" has been found. He tries to give the injection to his son, but he dramatically flies away (through the office window, no less). After that, he virtually disappears from the movie. I felt as if the chance to get to know him was never given.Another character left in the dark was Jimmy, also known as Leech (Cameron Bright). We do know that he's the source of the mutant-altering antibody, something powerful enough to render a mutant's abilities useless even when standing in his presence. But that's pretty much all we know. Who exactly are his parents? How did this corporation get a hold of him? Do they ever intend to let him go? None of this is helped by the fact that Cameron Bright played virtually the same role in ""Ultraviolet""; how many times in one year can the same actor portray the source of a controversial cure?Still, I have to give credit where credit is due, and I think that despite the issues I have with the film's structure and characterizaton, it's still a worthwhile experience. A majority of the story connects to the mysterious return of Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Jannsen), the powerful mind reader thought to have been killed at the end of ""X2: X-Men United."" The other characters still believe she's dead at the beginning of ""The Last Stand,"" and no one is taking it harder than Scott Summers, better known as Cyclops (James Marsden). He and Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) have never gotten along because of her, and her apparent death only made things worse between them. Scott's anger and pain drives him to return to the lake where she drowned. There, he hears her voice calling his name, so much so that it overcrowds the thoughts in his head. She then appears before him, and the two engage in a passionate reuniting kiss. But all is not as it seems; something in Jean has changed, something that affects her ability to control her powers. And unfortunately for Scott, it's too late for him to do anything about it.Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) knows that all of this is going on, and he seems to be succumbing to the stress of the whole situation (as well as of teaching at his mutant-friendly school). Even Ororo Munroe/Storm (Halle Berry) seems to think that something is bothering him, and while he insists that she shouldn't worry herself, her concern grows (especially since he considers her his eventual successor). And it grows even deeper when Jean is brought back. That's when the Professor attempts to psychically locate this unstable force within her and put it back in its cage. It's a force called Phoenix, Jean's alternate personality that operates on primal emotions, including rage. Jean ultimately endures psychological turmoil as she attempts to gain control of her mind. She's not the same Jean Grey we used to know, and she may never be again.The other part of this story involves Eric Lensherr/Magneto (Ian McKellen) and the war he declares against humanity. While the previous two films portrayed him strictly as the evil villain, the third film actually gives legitimacy to his bitterness. According to him, the vaccine is not a ""cure"" at all; it's merely a way to turn people of above-average ability into regular mortals. It's a volatile situation, especially since mutants are now a part of the American government. Here enters Dr. Hank McCoy/Beast (Kelsey Grammer), a blue, furry behemoth who recognizes both the drawbacks and benefits the vaccine has to offer. He works closely with the Professor as well as with the President (Josef Sommer) in the hopes of avoiding conflict between those who applaud the cure and those who oppose it (knowing full well that the point is probably moot).This aspect of the story shows a fairly realistic reaction towards a controversial idea. Some mutants are genuinely attracted to the prospect of finally being considered normal. Because of that, they wait in long lines to receive the vaccine. Marie/Rogue (Anna Paquin) is someone who takes the idea into serious consideration; her inability to touch without causing physical harm has driven a wedge between her and her boyfriend, Bobby/Iceman (Shawn Ashmore).But just as many mutants are outraged, and they are the ones who militantly join Magneto's cause. He already has Raven/Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) and John Allerdyce/Pyro (Aaron Stanford) as his main accomplices, but if he's to succeed in stopping the humans, he needs others at his side. He manages to attract a new group of mutants: the lightening-fast Callisto (Diana Ramirez); the duplicitous Multiple Man (Eric Dane); the burly, hotheaded Cain Marko/Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones); and the prickly Spike (Ken Leung). Magneto also needs to build an army large enough to successfully attack the site of the vaccine's production (which, interestingly, is the former site of Alcatraz). Lastly, he'll need Jean, a woman with powers greater than even his. Magneto slyly encourages her to unleash her dark side. Eventually he'll understand just how dangerous she has become, not only to herself, but to everyone else, as well.The movie culminates with a final battle at the heart of San Francisco Bay. Like any comic book film, it's an entertaining, highly stylized sequence that includes death, destruction, and redemption. Some of the moments are new and surprising while others are entirely expected. Does that make it a bad scene? Not really: for the most part, it's a lot of fun. However, I was turned off by a couple of things, including Kelsey Grammer's participation in the fight scenes. His overall performance was too sophisticated to allow for testosterone-driven kicks and punches. He should have remained the calm, intelligent politician he started out as, one who fights with words rather than fists.I realize this has been a strange review, seeing as I pointed out a lot of flaws in a film that's pretty well made. It's not a perfect sequel by any means, but I did find its willingness to be complex and insightful very meaningful. This could have easily been just another low-grade science fiction/action/adventure extravaganza, something entertaining yet shallow. ""The Last Stand"" cleverly disguises real social issues as a comic book plotline, and I think that's what made it the most compelling. True, a few loose ends were not tied up, and some of the explanations are vague at best. But its humanity outweighs its shortcomings, and for that, I'm going to recommend it. Hopefully, it can effectively shed some light on the issues we face today.",4,An Ethical Dilemma with a Capital X,1148601600,"05 26, 2006",2006,7769,"['good', 'know', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptation',

1012307,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B000HCO83G,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[0, 3]","The X-Men series has never been my favorite. It strains itself to be profound, but rarely ever is. They have WAY too many characters and not nearly enough screen time. They are too proud of their special effects. In general, the whole series has been mishandled. That said, for a summertime popcorn blockbuster how can I really complain about ""X-Men: The Last Stand""? What other Hollywood film of this stripe has the nerve to point out the ugly, discriminatory practices of our government? This film follows almost the same formula as the previous two films even though the switched directors from Bryan Singer (Superman beckoned) to Brett Ratner. The X-Men battle with themselves over being mutant, and then with other mutants whose politics they disagree with. There are basically two types of scenes here, those that involve pontifications and those that involve special effects bonanzas. These scenes get woven together pretty poorly, but nobody seems to care because they're just there to catch a glimpse of their favorite X-Man perform their greatest hits.The government, always looking to help out their citizens, has created a cure for mutants. Better yet, they are going to force them to take it. Hey if George Bush can win an election by campaigning against homosexuals why wouldn't those same tactics work for this president? My main problem with this film is its message, assuming that I am reading it correctly. Noam Chomsky has always said that there is no use is speaking truth to power because power already knows the truth, they just don't care. So at the end we have the ""bad"" X-Men fighting the government trying to stop them from forcing the mutants to take the antidote. Meanwhile, the ""good"" X-Men are fighting the ""bad"" X-Men over. . .a personal matter I guess. The poster for the film says ""Take a Stand"" and that is what Magneto and his crew were doing. Wolverine and Co., on the other hand, seemed to be fighting for complacency. Oh well. This is one blockbuster that at least dumbs the ideas down so far that even the dumbest guy in the audience is forced to think a little.We can all probably agree that money is a replacement for art, and that is quite obvious in many of these scenes (the Golden Gate Bridge incident, for instance). And that's fine, I like special effects too, but it underscores a bigger problem in the movie biz. People only like special effects, so a non-stop explosion-o-rama like ""The Marine"" gets to play in theaters across the country, but a thoughtful, non-explosive film like ""Half Nelson"" is stuck in box office hell (the art house). Halle Berry shows up here to pick up the easiest pay check of her career, as does Anna Paquin (looking suddenly old, no thanks to the strands of gray in her hair). In our society the only thing that is truly accepted is to be white, rich and hetero (if you don't believe me, look at out Senate). I just don't understand why this film had the villains be the only ones who stood up to this abomination. But then again, the movie studios probably like complacency. **3/4",3,At Least it is Better than X2,1163289600,"11 12, 2006",2006,3059,"['X-Men', 'series', 'never', 'been', 'favorite', 'be', 'profound', 'rarely', 'ever', 'have', 'WAY', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'are', 'too', 'proud', 'special', 'effects', 'general', 'whole', 'series', 'been', 'mishandled', 'said', 'summertime', 'popcorn', 'blockbuster', 'how', 'can', 'really', 'complain', 'X-Men', 'Last', 'Stand', 'What', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'stripe', 'nerve', 'point', 'out', 'ugly', 'discriminatory', 'practices', 'government', 'film', 'almost', 'same', 'formula', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'even', 'switched', 'directors', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'Superman', 'beckoned', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'X-Men', 'battle', 'over', 'being', 'mutant', 'then', 'other', 'mutants', 'politics', 'disagree', 'are', 'basically', 'two', 'types', 'scenes', 'here', 'involve', 'pontifications', 'involve', 'special', 'effects', 'bonanzas', 'scenes', 'get', 'woven', 'together', 'pretty', 'poorly', 'nobody', 'care', ""'re"", 'just', 'there', 'catch', 'glimpse', 'favorite', 'X-Man', 'perform', 'greatest', 'hits.The', 'government', 'always', 'looking', 'help', 'out', 'citizens', 'created', 'cure', 'mutants', 'Better', 'yet', 'are', 'going', 'force', 'take', 'Hey', 'George', 'Bush', 'can', 'win', 'election', 'campaigning', 'homosexuals', 'why', 'would', ""n't"", 'same', 'tactics', 'work', 'president', 'My', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'message', 'assuming', 'am', 'reading', 'correctly', 'Noam', 'Chomsky', 'always', 'said', 'use', 'speaking', 'truth', 'power', 'power', 'already', 'truth', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'So', 'end', 'have', 'bad', 'X-Men', 'fighting', 'government', 'trying', 'stop', 'forcing', 'mutants', 'take', 'antidote', 'Meanwhile', 'good', 'X-Men', 'are', 'fighting', 'bad', 'X-Men', '.a', 'personal', 'matter', 'guess', 'poster', 'film', 'Take', 'Stand', 'what', 'Magneto', 'crew', 'were', 'doing', 'Wolverine', 'Co.', 'other', 'hand', 'seemed', 'be', 'fighting', 'complacency', 'Oh', 'well', 'one', 'blockbuster', 'least', 'dumbs', 'ideas', 'down', 'so', 'far', 'even', 'dumbest', 'guy', 'audience', 'forced', 'think', 'little.We', 'can', 'probably', 'agree', 'money', 'replacement', 'art', 'quite', 'obvious', 'many', 'scenes', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', 'incident', 'instance', 'fine', 'like', 'special', 'effects', 'too', 'bigger', 'problem', 'movie', 'biz', 'People', 'only', 'special', 'effects', 'non-stop', 'explosion-o-rama', 'Marine', 'play', 'theaters', 'country', 'thoughtful', 'non-explosive', 'film', 'Half', 'Nelson', 'stuck', 'box', 'office', 'hell', 'art', 'house', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'up', 'here', 'pick', 'up', 'easiest', 'pay', 'check', 'career', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'looking', 'suddenly', 'old', 'thanks', 'strands', 'gray', 'hair', 'society', 'only', 'thing', 'truly', 'accepted', 'be', 'white', 'rich', 'hetero', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'look', 'out', 'Senate', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'film', 'had', 'villains', 'be', 'only', 'ones', 'who', 'stood', 'up', 'abomination', 'then', 'again', 'movie', 'probably', 'like', 'complacency', '**3/4']",N/A

Many people gave a sigh of disappointment since Ratner is less a director than more a ""session player"" that musicians use in the studio. What made the previous films work was that not only were they great comic book movies, they were just simply great movies with action scenes as well as some deeper issues and meanings. X-Men 3 became what the series shouldn't have been: a blockbuster and nothing more.The main inspiration for the film is the ""Dark Phoenix"" saga, arguably one of the most-well known and best sagas in Marvel's history. Jean Grey has been brought back to life after her death in X2 only she seems...changed. She seems a bit more uninhibited and carries a bit of a mean streak. Meanwhile, scientists at Worthington Labs have developed a cure of the mutant gene and are planning to allow willing mutants to take it and be ""normal"". Of course this infuriates Magneto and he establishes the Brotherhood, a group of mutants who are going to stop the cure no matter how.One complaint that's always been in the X-Men films is the sheer number of characters. Unlike the comics where you can actually do an arc on one character alone, here they jampack it with a whole bunch of characters that it's kind of overwhelming. In addition to X2's cast (besides sorely-missed Nightcrawler), we have Juggernaut, Callisto, Quill, Angel, Beast, Multiple Man and Kitty Pryde. Hell, I think they even added in Psylocke and some others not even mentioned. It ends up making an already big cast bloated. Not to mention certain characters react differently than before and an off-screen death is just inexcusable.The anticipated notions of an X-Men movie tend to be scenes exclusively related to a character. Whether it's fight scenes like Wolverine vs Lady Deathstrike or the Nightcrawler attack on the White House, it's also geeky to see a scene of fights and mayhem. This film certainly has it from a small-but-cool cameo of a Sentinel to a big fight involving a house and the epic finale, it's certainly great to see things in a bigger proportion. Only problem is the scenes don't have an emotional resonance, it's just ""time to see some computer-y stuff"".If you manage to be a fan of this, is this worth buying? Depends if you want special features. All we have are alternate endings, deleted scenes and pat-on-the-back commentaries. If you're looking for some in-depth stuff, you'd best look to the eventual double-dip.",3,I want to like this but I can't,1161388800,"10 21, 2006",2006,2639,"['When', 'development', 'plagued', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'finally', 'got', 'off', 'ground', 'thanks', 'X-Men', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'reins', 'had', 'be', 'passed', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'director', 'Rush', 'Hour', 'films', 'Red', 'Dragon', 'Many', 'people', 'gave', 'sigh', 'disappointment', 'Ratner', 'less', 'director', 'more', 'session', 'player', 'use', 'studio', 'What', 'made', 'previous', 'films', 'work', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'were', 'great', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'were', 'just', 'simply', 'great', 'movies', 'action', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'deeper', 'issues', 'meanings', 'X-Men', '3', 'became', 'what', 'series', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'blockbuster', 'nothing', 'more.The', 'main', 'inspiration', 'film', 'Dark', 'Phoenix', 'saga', 'arguably', 'one', 'most-well', 'known', 'best', 'sagas', 'Marvel', 'history', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'been', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'death', 'X2', 'only', 'changed', 'bit', 'more', 'uninhibited', 'bit', 'mean', 'streak', 'Meanwhile', 'scientists', 'Worthington', 'Labs', 'have', 'developed', 'cure', 'mutant', 'gene', 'are', 'planning', 'allow', 'willing', 'mutants', 'take', 'be', 'normal', 'course', 'Magneto', 'Brotherhood', 'group', 'mutants', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'stop', 'cure', 'matter', 'how.One', 'complaint', 'always', 'been', 'X-Men', 'films', 'sheer', 'number', 'characters', 'comics', 'where', 'can', 'actually', 'do', 'arc', 'one', 'character', 'alone', 'here', 'jampack', 'whole', 'bunch', 'characters', 'kind', 'overwhelming', 'addition', 'X2', 'cast', 'sorely-missed', 'Nightcrawler', 'have', 'Juggernaut', 'Callisto', 'Quill', 'Angel', 'Beast', 'Multiple', 'Man', 'Kitty', 'Pryde', 'Hell', 'think', 'even', 'added', 'Psylocke', 'others', 'not', 'even', 'mentioned', 'up', 'making', 'already', 'big', 'cast', 'bloated', 'Not', 'mention', 'certain', 'characters', 'react', 'differently', 'before', 'off-screen', 'death', 'just', 'inexcusable.The', 'anticipated', 'notions', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'tend', 'be', 'scenes', 'exclusively', 'related', 'character', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Wolverine', 'vs', 'Lady', 'Deathstrike', 'Nightcrawler', 'attack', 'White', 'House', 'also', 'geeky', 'see', 'scene', 'fights', 'mayhem', 'film', 'certainly', 'small-but-cool', 'cameo', 'Sentinel', 'big', 'fight', 'involving', 'house', 'epic', 'finale', 'certainly', 'great', 'see', 'things', 'bigger', 'proportion', 'Only', 'problem', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'just', 'time', 'see', 'computer-y', 'stuff', 'manage', 'be', 'fan', 'worth', 'buying', 'want', 'special', 'features', 'have', 'are', 'alternate', 'endings', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'pat-on-the-back', 'commentaries', ""'re"", 'looking', 'in-depth', 'stuff', ""'d"", 'best', 'look', 'eventual', 'double-dip']",N/A

This contains spoilers.Pros:- It's a lot more action and effects than the previous two films. While the first two were more of a story, this was more eye-candy. It's the fireworks display after a day of Independence. I gave this movie an extra star solely because of the Golden Gate bridge sequence.- We finally get to see the Phoenix and what she can do. A whole slew of new mutants are also introduced: Juggernaut, Multiple Man, Kitty Pryde, and others are here.- The core story is simple enought to follow. It's impossible to get lost halfway through the movie.Cons:- I feel that the characters I've learned to appreciate are wasted. Rogue, Mystique, Professor-X, Cyclops,... They're pretty much gone a mere 15 or so minutes into the movie.- Although I liked the fairly simple story, it wouldn't have hurt to provide more characterization for the, well, characters. Angel, Colossus, and the others were just too one-dimensional.- The length. It's supposedly the last of the series and with a run-time of just under an hour and forty-five minutes, it didn't satisfy me. I feel robbed.- The dialogue is pretty awful in most parts. I mean, I know it's something to expect in these kinds of movies but the folks here didn't even seem like they were trying to stray away from that.It just feels like storyline/plot of this movie was rushed. I don't know whose fault it is, Ratner & Co. or Fox, but I think this movie would've been A LOT better (maybe even superior) to Singer's vision if it were split into two.The Last Stand is a condensed, crash-course version of the X-Men universe, and it doesn't work. Somewhere along the line, I hope another X-Men film will be made, albeit not follow this storyline because it's basically ruined.

In the civil rights mythology, Magneto is the Malcolm X to Professor Xavier's MLK;2) Diversity - in a world of white American superheroes, this was the first international superhero group - gathered from all over the world - African, Japanese, Russian, Irish, German, Canadian, and Native American,3) Despite being hated and feared, they were unquestionably heroic.This rich heritage has been the backdrop for over 35 years of stories. Sadly, none of this was evident in this movie. The underlying storyline of striving for justice in a world of injustice was completely lost in the admittedly cool, apocalyptic levels of destruction. Superheros are just that -- super-heroic. Its not so much about their abilities as their character. That's why I've been a comic book fan for so many years. But in this case, &#34;The Last Stand&#34; was a superhero film with lots of &#34;supers&#34;, but very few heroes.I did give it two stars for the amazing special effects (Magneto's destruction of the Golden Gate bridge was worth one star alone) and because more than anyone else in the film, Hugh Jackman unerringly channels the essence of the Wolverine character and captures the nuances that made this character so popular with so many for so long.I didn't hate this movie, but I was relieved that the most recent &#34;Days of Future Past&#34; undoes much of what happened in this particular film.",2,"Super, but not heroes",1402358400,"06 10, 2014",2014,1777,"['started', 'reading', 'X-Men', 'boy', 'right', 'when', 'legendary', 'Chris', 'Claremont', 'took', 'over', 'writing', 'created', 'characters', 'Storm', 'Nightcrawler', 'course', 'Wolverine.What', 'made', 'X-Men', 'incredible', 'was', 'three', 'things:1', 'Social', 'relevance', 'people', 'hated', 'feared', 'simply', 'were', 'different', 'served', 'parable', 'oppressed', 'people', 'particularly', 'people', 'color', 'gays', 'civil', 'rights', 'mythology', 'Magneto', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'Professor', 'Xavier', 'MLK', '2', 'Diversity', 'world', 'white', 'American', 'superheroes', 'was', 'first', 'international', 'superhero', 'group', 'gathered', 'world', 'African', 'Japanese', 'Russian', 'Irish', 'German', 'Canadian', 'Native', 'American,3', 'being', 'hated', 'feared', 'were', 'unquestionably', 'heroic.This', 'rich', 'heritage', 'been', 'backdrop', '35', 'years', 'stories', 'Sadly', 'none', 'was', 'evident', 'movie', 'underlying', 'storyline', 'striving', 'justice', 'world', 'injustice', 'was', 'completely', 'lost', 'admittedly', 'cool', 'apocalyptic', 'levels', 'destruction', 'Superheros', 'are', 'just', 'super-heroic', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'abilities', 'character', 'why', ""'ve"", 'been', 'comic', 'book', 'fan', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'case', '34', 'Last', 'Stand', '34', 'was', 'superhero', 'film', 'lots', '34', 'supers', '34', 'very', 'few', 'heroes.I', 'did', 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'amazing', 'special', 'effects', 'Magneto', 'destruction', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'bridge', 'was', 'worth', 'one', 'star', 'alone', 'more', 'anyone', 'else', 'film', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'unerringly', 'essence', 'Wolverine', 'character', 'nuances', 'made', 'character', 'so', 'popular', 'so', 'many', 'so', 'long.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'movie', 'was', 'relieved', 'most', 'recent', '34', 'Days', 'Future', 'Past', '34', 'undoes', 'much', 'what', 'happened', 'particular', 'film']",N/A

The first couple of these movies were pretty fun and this one provides the big battle Magneto has been aiming at for quite awhile.What I don't like about this movie is the sheer number of mutants.  I mean, there are so many of them by what definition could they be mutations?  And since all their powers seem more or less unique, what in the world could be happening genetically (which is more about conserving useful traits)?Anyway, the mutants go to war because the government has come up with a ""cure"" that suppresses the mutant's mutantness.  And while some mutants want to take this cure, others feel that it is wrong to cure any of them because it is tantamount to admitting that being a mutant means something is wrong with you.  We see this in real life with a movement working against the notion that it would be a blessing to provide them with hearing.  There are other aspects that the X-Men movies allude to none to subtly that I will not comment on except to note that we all know it is there.The big scenes are all quite spectacular and there are lots and lots and lots of mutants with some cool and some silly powers.  This whole cure thing has some odd effects and it isn't only the tangential characters that get whacked in this one.So, enjoy!  But don't expect to get too much in the way of character development.

No, I am more of a longtime fan of the 1990s Fox Channel cartoon series. With that bias-ness in mind, I have to say, even in animated form, this movie still wouldn't work.Having followed the cartoon series for more than four years, it more or less covered the popular themes of the comics such as the creation of Sentinels, each X-Men's roots of origins, the Savage Lands, the Phoneix/Dark Phoneix saga. Whatever Bryan Singer had built up as a momentum for the 1st two movies, Brett Ratner prematurely ""[...]"" it all in this movie. I know that Ratner was brought in as a last minute replacement, and the core of the problems lies with the script and the Fox executives behind it.Seeing that all franchises should end as a trilogy (Star Wars, Indiana Jones), in all their infinite wisdom, the Fox executives decided to throw every possible thing they got in this final movie in the franchise, thus ""The Last Stand"". Too much cooks doth spoil the broth, as the saying goes. Let's take a closer look at the casting:1. Halle Berry looks better here, I admit. But does she have to be the central character now? Let's face it, she can't act here.2. Kelsey Grammer as The Beast. Wonderful casting choice. Unfortunately, he participated in just one battle. We need more ""beast"" moves and fight scenes here!3. Alan Cumming not returning as the cheeky German Nightcrawler? Uh-oh...not a good sign.Even though I am not the final authority on the X-Men comic universe, but I can safely vouch for the fact that the Dark Phoneix subplot was treated with an utter sense of contempt and disrespect. The Dark Phoneix saga should provide the backdrop for an entire X-Men movie! The pacing is so uneven, as if Ratner couldn't wait to get to the action sequences. Talk about ADD! He's worst than a high school kid on speed. He should be injected with Ritalin.With a reported budget of US$210 million dollars, I don't see where the money had gone to. The subtitle of the movie states it is ""The Last Stand"". The last battle at the end was alleged to be an all-out war as advertised and stated by the characters in the movie.

The humans have created a cure thanks to a young mutant with the ability to cause other mutants powers to be null and void in his presence and they intend to hold this out to the public for their use.  For any mutant who wants a normal life, here is your chance to get it.  The only problem is that Magneto and his band of baddies decides to wage war on the humans in protest.  It's at this point the humans decide to use this cure as a weapon against mutantkind which results in an all out war.  In the meantime, Jean Grey (Famke) who was assumed dead has come back to life in the form of Phoenix, her alter ego and has joined forces with Magneto.  The X-Men must fight to save the world from Magneto while battling there emotional ties to Jean (especially Wolverine)  Also, we have some mutants (Beast and Rogue primarily) who may even welcome the cure, and Rogue who has concerns about her relationship with Bobby (Iceman) beings that she can't touch him, and when he starts showing interest in Shadowcat, Rogue strongly conciders taking the cure for herself.  With the inclusion of mutants like Jugernut, Shadowcat, Angel and Beast you'd think it may get confusing, but the film flows nicely and explains everything very well.  It may not be the best of the bunch (X2 was by far the best) it still holds your interest and delivers solid hollywood entertainment, and Miss Famke delivers the best acting in the bunch as the very tempermental Phoenix.

Not so with this film. A weapon that can definitively rob them of their mutant natures levels the playing field).- It injects some moral ambiguity into the plot; you can tell that Ian McKellen (himself a legendary gay activist in the UK) relishes the chance to explore the concept of a cure for a condition (read 'orientation') that can mold one's identity whilst simultaneously making them a societal outcast in some quarters. Kudos to McKellen's performance - I actually found myself rooting for Magneto's brotherwood to prevail.Brett Ratner clearly feels less affection for the characters than Bryan Singer and in this case, that's no bad thing. I don't mind a director loving his characters as long he's not prepared to let that get in the way of the plot - something that Singer always did.

While Singer's approach was darker, Ratner goes for a bit of both worlds.  Special effects are fantastic.  There are scenes where you will laugh at loud, something that was missing from the first two.  This movie was fun and didn't feel 20 minutes too long like the first two.  Now don't get me wrong...I enjoyed the first two.  It's just that this one was more appealing to me.  For those who worship the first 2 films, you will probably not like this as much.This movie does have its flaws, though.  Nightcrawler is almost fully absent in this movie, which was a shame because I enjoyed him in the 2nd movie.  Also, Archangel was underutilized (I think it's hard to fit everybody since there are so many characters and they don't want the movie to drag).  I also wished that Gambit would make an appearance in the X-men movies (he was always my favorite).  Ever since watching LOST, I thought that Josh Holloway (Sawyer) would make a good Gambit and then read that he was going to be Gambit (but something happened where they didn't write Gambit in, for whatever reason).Oh, and the scene where Wolverine gets shot by the arrow, he heals himself but his shirt no longer has the hole from the arrow...I guess his shirt is self healing as well!All in all, this movie was well worth watching (and watching again).

The third installment of this X-Men franchise brings us the appearance of new characters, old ones and a the transformation of Jean Grey into the Phoenix, all in one movie.The plot involves humans discovering a ""cure"" for those who wish to be rid of their mutant powers and blend into society.  While both sets of mutants, led by Professor Xavier and Magneto, respectively, do not agree with a cure, the two take different view points on how to deal with the situation.  Magneto decides it is time for the mutants to stand up to the unevolved humans who are trying to erradicate anyone with mutant powers.  Xavier's X-Men knows it is up to them to stop their evil counterparts from going to war with humanity.This film marks a huge change in the franchise.  There is the death of THREE major characters, major characters lose their powers to the ""cure"" and there are changes in leadership at Xavier's school.  Magneto's Brotherhood is also affected, left in shambles by the end of the movie.While I enjoyed the film, I do have some small complaints.  I'd liked to have seen the director do more with Angel.  He was pretty much left with nothing to do.  To be honest, I would loved to have seen the Phoenix hang around for another film.  The Phoenix is such an interesting and complex character, I think we could have benefited from another appearance in the franchise.As for compliments, I really enjoyed Kelsey Grammer as Beast. I really hope we see more of him in the next film. I think the director did a good job of keeping the story fast moving and giving the fans a lot of action.  And the ending pretty much shows us that things are not over.  I, for one, am looking forward to the revamped mutants and the next challenge they will face.

I've been reading the ""X-Men"" and all its spin-offs for over 25 years now, and my biggest complaint was what little time Colossus got.  *grumbles*  Great character sacrificed for Halle Berry, I guess.Obviously folks were disappointed with some of the happenings in the film.  Nightcrawler gone, either to budget constraints or to Alan Cummings not wanting to play the role.  Mystique de-powered, possibly due to Ms Romaijn's hesitance to resign for more X-films.  Cyclops gone due to James Mardsen wanting to move on (which he was grumbling about shortly after the first film!).  Etc, etc, etc.  I think a lot of people are blaming this on Brett, but I'm not so sure it's appropriate.  And they're ignoring the impact some of it had...  Jean kills the man of her dreams, and has to have the man who loves her kill her.  Magneto's most important advisor (and more...?) now taken away from him at the start of a civil war.  Storm having to come into her own as the head of the Academy.  A lot of impact being glossed over.As an end to the trilogy, I really did enjoy it, however.  It introduced some fresh mutants for later films, gave many of the actors who are tired of the ""X-Men"" their outs, and a civil war among the mutant population wasn't a bad thing.  Is Brett a good compliment to Bryan?  Oh, certainly not, and I was a bit disappointed in the lack of additional character development, especially concerning the Phoeniz saga, hence the loss of a star. When the new big bad looks bored the entire time she's playing the big bad, well, Houston, we have a problem.Action-wise, it was everything I could ask for.  The casting of the new mutants was spot on, and I would certainly pay to see Ellen Page, Daniel Cudmore, Shawn Ashmore, and Ben Foster in a spin-off.  Considering the lack of lines, I was impressed with Omahydra, Mei Marcon, and some of the other ""evil"" mutants at least creating a ""presence"", and we may see more of Vinnie Jones and Eric Dane (I hope!).I'd be more disappointed if there is an X4 instead of spin-offs.  Cleaning up X3 wouldn't work too well, Wolvie and Mags are slated for thier own films, Halle Berry is too demanding to be part of an ensemble cast (sorry, Halle!), and most of the characters have been irrevocably changed to the point that they would need another three films to clean the loose ends up.  At this point, spin-offs are a better idea.As for the DVD, don't waste the cash on the ""Collector's Edition"" unless you really want the comic book.  All the extras are going to be the same, and I look forward to the deleted scenes and alternate endings, especially after reading Claremont's novelization of the film.Over all, a good last film (hopefully) with its flaws, but certainly a good ending to the X-Universe on film.",4,A good ending... if it is the end,1159747200,"10 2, 2006",2006,3488,"['Obviously', 'were', '*few*', 'things', 'film', 'were', 'totally', 'inconsistent', 'comic', 'books', 'Phoenix', 'Saga', 'one', 'hand', 'losing', 'cosmic', 'plotline', 'take', 'something', 'away', 'film', 'demise', 'Cyclops', 'so', 'early', 'other', 'hand', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'worked', 'big', 'screen', 'Period', 'would', 'have', 'taken', '3', 'films', 'own', 'resolve', 'Instead', 'inspiration', 'was', 'drawn', 'Ultimate', 'X-Men', 'plotline', 'worked', 'well', 'screen', 'made', 'lot', 'more', 'sense', 'be', 'honest', 'Especially', 'average', 'moviegoer', 'film', 'was', 'geared', 'towards', 'Toss', 'presence', 'good', 'mutants', 'evil', 'mutants', 'other', 'stuff', 'uber-purists', 'will', 'complain.Me', ""'ve"", 'been', 'reading', 'X-Men', 'spin-offs', '25', 'years', 'now', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'was', 'what', 'little', 'time', 'Colossus', 'got', '*grumbles*', 'Great', 'character', 'sacrificed', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'guess.Obviously', 'folks', 'were', 'disappointed', 'happenings', 'film', 'Nightcrawler', 'gone', 'budget', 'constraints', 'Alan', 'Cummings', 'not', 'wanting', 'play', 'role', 'Mystique', 'de-powered', 'possibly', 'due', 'Ms', 'Romaijn', 'hesitance', 'resign', 'more', 'X-films', 'Cyclops', 'gone', 'due', 'James', 'Mardsen', 'wanting', 'move', 'was', 'grumbling', 'about', 'shortly', 'first', 'film', 'Etc', 'etc', 'etc', 'think', 'lot', 'people', 'are', 'blaming', 'Brett', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'appropriate', ""'re"", 'ignoring', 'impact', 'had', 'Jean', 'man', 'dreams', 'have', 'man', 'who', 'kill', 'Magneto', 'most', 'important', 'advisor', 'more', 'now', 'taken', 'away', 'start', 'civil', 'war', 'Storm', 'having', 'come', 'own', 'head', 'Academy', 'lot', 'impact', 'being', 'glossed', 'end', 'trilogy', 'really', 'did', 'enjoy', 'however', 'introduced', 'fresh', 'mutants', 'later', 'films', 'gave', 'many', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'tired', 'X-Men', 'outs', 'civil', 'war', 'mutant', 'population', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'thing', 'Brett', 'good', 'compliment', 'Bryan', 'Oh', 'certainly', 'not', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'additional', 'character', 'development', 'especially', 'concerning', 'Phoeniz', 'saga', 'hence', 'loss', 'star', 'When', 'new', 'big', 'bad', 'looks', 'bored', 'entire', 'time', 'playing', 'big', 'bad', 'well', 'Houston', 'have', 'problem.Action-wise', 'was', 'everything', 'could', 'ask', 'casting', 'new', 'mutants', 'was', 'spot', 'would', 'certainly', 'pay', 'see', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'Daniel', 'Cudmore', 'Shawn', 'Ashmore', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'spin-off', 'Considering', 'lack', 'lines', 'was', 'impressed', 'Omahydra', 'Mei', 'Marcon', 'other', 'evil', 'mutants', 'least', 'creating', 'presence', 'may', 'see', 'more', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'Eric', 'Dane', 'hope', '.I', ""'d"", 'be', 'more', 'disappointed', 'X4', 'instead', 'spin-offs', 'Cleaning', 'up', 'X3', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'too', 'well', 'Wolvie', 'Mags', 'are', 'slated', 'thier', 'own', 'films', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'too', 'demanding', 'be', 'part', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'sorry', 'Halle', 'most', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'irrevocably', 'changed', 'point', 'would', 'need', 'three', 'films', 'clean', 'loose', 'up', 'point', 'spin-offs', 'are', 'better', 'idea.As', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'cash', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'really', 'want', 'comic', 'book', 'extras', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'same', 'look', 'forward', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'endings', 'especially', 'reading', 'Claremont', 'novelization', 'film.Over', 'good', 'last', 'film', 'hopefully', 'flaws', 'certainly', 'good', 'ending', 'X-Universe', 'film']",N/A

There's a wealth of charactors, we tried to fit ""Angel"" into three movies and as you know this is the first time we got him in!"" ..... So as you can see ... dont worry there will be many more X-Men films for you to enjoy in the future!So as a whole this was a really fun ride that with held by far the best special-effects of the series BUT, I cant lie and tell you that this movie is great or even as good as the first film (it is better than the 2nd..) because it really isnt, the story line is actually quite basic, the acting as I am sure you guessed is most definatly up to par and the direction overall is decent if not better, ""The Last Stand"" is truly a smart, fun and cool way to start off you movie watching summer!P.S. By the way I just saw the numbers for what the film made on its opening weekend - it made a huge amount of just over 120,000,000$ dollars! that puts it on pace to easily pass all the other suppossed summer Box Office Hits such as, Mission Impossible 3, The Da Vinci Code, Over the Hedge & Poseidon!Overall: B",4,"Good, Summer Blockbuster Hit",1148860800,"05 29, 2006",2006,2094,"['have', 'been', 'X-men', 'fan', 'long', 'time', 'seeing', 'Last', 'Stand', 'have', 'admit', 'was', '100', '%', 'entertained', 'film', 'oscar', 'movie', 'really', 'not', 'made', 'be', 'made', 'entertain', 'summer', 'movieveiwers', 'who', 'enjoy', 'action', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'outlandish', 'ideas', 'concepts', 'will', 'have', 'alot', 'fun', 'X3.Hugh', 'Jackman', 'tough', 'bladed-beast', 'Wolverine', 'usual', 'gang', 'as', 'well', 'such', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'playing', 'weather', 'controlling', 'Storm', 'Metal', 'controller', 'Magneto', 'Eric', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'more', 'Iceman', 'Pyro', 'Jean', 'Professor', 'Xaveir', 'Mystique', 'Rouge', 'cast', 'movie', 'let', 'down', 'audience', 'unique', 'powerful', 'mutant', 'do', 'get', 'feel', 'film', 'other', 'end', 'Last', 'Stand', 'last', 'installment', 'X-men', 'series', 'are', 'most', 'definatly', 'misled', 'Ralph', 'Winter', '1', '3', 'Producers', 'Last', 'Stand', 'said', 'Entertainment', 'Weekly', 'not', 'last', 'movie', 'are', 'lot', 'more', 'stories', 'wealth', 'charactors', 'tried', 'fit', 'Angel', 'three', 'movies', 'know', 'first', 'time', 'got', 'So', 'can', 'see', 'dont', 'worry', 'will', 'be', 'many', 'more', 'X-Men', 'films', 'enjoy', 'future', 'So', 'whole', 'was', 'really', 'fun', 'ride', 'held', 'far', 'best', 'special-effects', 'series', 'BUT', 'cant', 'lie', 'tell', 'movie', 'great', 'even', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'film', 'better', '2nd..', 'really', 'isnt', 'story', 'line', 'actually', 'quite', 'basic', 'acting', 'am', 'sure', 'guessed', 'most', 'definatly', 'par', 'direction', 'overall', 'decent', 'not', 'better', 'Last', 'Stand', 'truly', 'smart', 'fun', 'cool', 'way', 'start', 'off', 'movie', 'watching', 'summer', 'P.S', 'way', 'just', 'saw', 'numbers', 'what', 'film', 'made', 'opening', 'weekend', 'made', 'huge', 'amount', 'just', '120,000,000', 'dollars', 'pace', 'easily', 'pass', 'other', 'suppossed', 'summer', 'Box', 'Office', 'Hits', 'such', 'Mission', 'Impossible', '3', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'Hedge', 'Poseidon', 'Overall', 'B']",N/A

I'll be honest, I liked the movie, but I was still slightly disappointed.The movie is really fun. The cast is great. I think much of the casting in the X-Men movies have been spot on. Hugh Jackson, Famke Jansen, Ian McKellen, & Patrick Stewart are these X-Men characters. The new cast members to the series don't quite like up the original cast or maybe thats the screenplays fault. I don't really get to grasp the newbies except maybe Beast. The new villains, Colossus, Shadowcat, & Angel are a little underdeveloped.That not a big big problem. Thats not what people see an action movie for. I didn't have a problem with that part of the movie. The action is spectacular and the special effects are great. There is no part that is as exhilarating as Wolverine's fight with Lady Deathstrike in X2, but the fights & effects work. Just the spectacle along is pretty much work the admission to the movie alone.I liked this movie a lot. It is a little more emotionally involving(word choice?)due to the fact that it is sadder compared to the other movies and the effects, etc are top notch.

So, when the movies started picking up that storyline, I naturally expected them to stick with something along the lines of that basic plot. The Last Stand doesn't. It actually comes up with a scenario that is grimmer, grittier, and ultmately more tragic than what is presented in the comics (since Jean Grey's death was never actually finaly, that storyline's impact was diminished gradually anyway).This actually is the best of the three X Men movies, and a fitting conclusion to the saga. X-men purists will dislike the way some of their favorite characters are treated (and I would have liked to have seen more of Rogue, Cyclops, Colossus and Jubilee myself), but the storyline moves quickly is so compelling that it's like a freight train. I've rarely seen a movie these days where you are so fixated on what happens next that you can't take your eyes off of it.  There are a lot of special effects in the movie, but I disagree with the notion that it is all about special effects.  It's about people, where they try and where they fail, and I'm impressed that the movie took a more realistic look at them than tried to tack on a cheap happy ending to it.About the extras, there aren't many, and that would be my one major gripe.

1012338,A3EJYJC25OJVKK,B000HCO83G,"Distant Voyageur ""Nicholas Computer""","[6, 15]","After the beginning of the sage of ""X-Men"" beginning with the 2000 original and going all the way up to a much grander scale with ""X-Men United"", the third in what is sometimes referred to as the trilogy of X-Men films entitled ""The Last Stand"" brings the epic saga to a glorious close. I am very much clueless as to why this movie seems to be getting far more negative reviews than it's predecessors. While far from perfect, ""The Last Stand"" is true to it's title: It is a grand finale to the current X-Men movie saga. Yet I just can't imagine how they can make a fourth one after the events that take place here unless they are doing Wolverine or Magneto spin-off movies.Some time after Charles Xavier's X-Men and his archenemy Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants united against a common foe hell-bent on wiping out the mutant race, the two camps are suddenly torn apart in an acrimonious division between the mutant race as non-mutant or `normal' humans devise a medical substance that works as a `cure' for mutant powers and suppresses the genes that cause the mutant powers to manifest. The so-called cure divides the mutant community into several camps but the prominent ones are the X-Men lead by Charles Xavier who work to bridge the divide between mutants and non-mutants, the second is of the scientists devising the `cure', and the third and most vicious is Magneto's camp who views the `cure' as a tactic to commit genocide against the mutant community and he and his army aim to destroy this cure and will destroy anyone who stands in his way, even if it's a mutant. So the battle begins and the battle lines are now drawn. Xavier, The X-Men and their allies believe in tolerance and bridging the divide between the mutants and human beings but Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants believes that mutants are the superior race on earth and aims to establish mutant control over non-mutants.The so-called cure devised on a research facility on Alcatraz Island was made in reaction to the news of an enormously powerful mutant with the ability to wipe out entire cities with one fell swoop. Jean Grey, who was thought to have actually died after sacrificing herself to save the others from a large flood, mysteriously returns to life but with a far greater power that manifest in the subconscious parts of her mind. This power sees Grey revived as the Phoenix. Yet these enormous news powers that have manifested in her, have made her a monstrously powerful mutant whose powers endanger everyone around her, both ally and enemy alike, mutant and non-mutant alike, as well as the entire planet.So the battle lines are drawn and the war begins between the three camps, the non-mutants protecting this `cure', the X-Men aiming to end the enmity between the races, and Magneto's Brotherhood organization's goals of mutant superiority. It is indeed the war to end all wars as so it is said. Who will turn out victorious when it is over?I am absolutely proud to have seen this movie. A major reason for this is that the whole idea of a `cure' for mutants reminds me of the bigoted beliefs in `curing' homosexual and bisexuality in human beings and the horrific consequences of these bigoted beliefs. While too complex to jam into this review, watching ""The Last Stand"" really reminded me vividly of the gay rights movement occurring across the United States with one camp being those who've made their inner peace with their orientation and the other being the camp that views homosexuality as a `disease' which is completely and totally absurd. Such behavior is documented in almost every species of animals including dogs, cats, as well as our closest relatives, the chimpanzees. Though there's much more about this that cannot be squashed into this review, ""The Last Stand"" story plot I felt has a lot of parallels to the battle against homophobia and intolerance against not just gays, lesbians and bisexuals, but also others because of their differences. There is no need for a `cure' for this orientation.The movies problems though are similar to it's predecessors. Rogue is just another false-angst-ridden teen who's reduced from a dynamite comic character to just a wooden stock character who has almost no role in the events. In fact, Rogue felt more like an cameo extra rather than a main character. I really like this character and the complex background but after seeing some improvement in ""X2"" over its 2000 predecessor, I was disappointed. I think they should do a Rogue spin-off movie to make up for this. My biggest disappointment was the small role of Mystique after her front-row seat in the last movie. After being a major staple in the last two, Mystique is almost completely absent after about 20 minutes into the movie.Storm though is an improvement and has far better roles in this than before. The movie also somewhat tones down some of the emotional weight in favor of tons of action and a dazzling array of special effect. The emotional part is definitely there throughout but in many areas, it gets lost amidst the heavy amounts of action battle sequences and special effects in many parts of the movie. Who knows what may come next but after seeing this, I don't see how they could make another one without the characters who were so much a staple throughout this saga unless it's a total reboot of the film series similar to how ""Batman Begins"" rebooted the Batman movie franchise after the disaster of ""Batman and Robin"" a decade ago.",5,This is a movie worth standing up for!,1151625600,"06 30,

The personal investments and inner pain of all the characters is severed in a under impressive action packed disaster. Everyone's motivation and inner issues can be explain in less than one thought bubble. The audence no longer has to think, see the emotional journey continue from the previous films...(Or any emotional journey at all) or really care about any of the X-Men. Many of them stand around and do nothing to move the plot forward and just mash things when THe time calls.(This goes for many of the important characters of 1 and 2.)THe original message of the fight for understanding and equality takes a back seat to wild and untamed action with two very thin plot lines. Its all just a uninteresting down hill plumet into a huge final battle in which no charatcer really develops any further.Magneto falls into the void of the ""Typical"" Bad Guy. He is no longer a scarred man fighting savagly because of his fear of what tomorrow may bring. You can't identify with him. He is a Megalomaniac without a soul. No longer the cool shade of grey character.The scenes only purposes are to bridge the gap between fight scenes and noone ever has anything insightful or dramatic to say save Magneto's speech in the Church which sounds hacked to pieces anyway.Any Characters whos powers are not by nature destructive is written out of the story or killed off.

Those who view their mutations as being not only good, but a step in the evolutionary process, are led once again by Magneto against the X-Men. Also, Jean Grey comes back from her apparent death in the second film, but not all is quite right with her.This movie shares some of the strengths and weakness of the earlier films. Strengths include great casting and, thus, performances. Having Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen share a screen is simply awesome, and it's always nice to get Halle Berry and Rebecca Romijn on camera. :) Weaknesses include trying to fit too much into the film; this series has always been weakened in that it tries to satisfy all of the X-Men fans by shoving every character in, in one way or another. As a result, we finally get Angel...  but only for about 10 minutes of screentime. Juggernaut gets even less. Someone less familiar with the comics might get confused with all of the characters, running on and off screen for a few shots. I think it would've worked out better if they'd had fewer characters and plotlines altogether, and concentrated more on them.Truth-be-told, this is probably the weakest installment of the series. The writing is a little cliche at times, and Cyclops' character continues to be grossly misused. There once was talk of Joss Whedon being involved in this project, but it never came to pass. I wish he had; Whedon has a magic with him that this movie could've used. And yet, the movie is very entertaining and never dull.Big Tip: almost everyone walked out from our theater when the credits began to roll (they always do). Don't do it. Wait till the credits are over; there's an important scene after the credits which pays off something subtly set-up earlier in the film.All in all, this is a fun movie that will reward those who've watched and enjoyed the first two. Despite a small decline in quality (from the *stellar* X2), it remains entertaining, larger-than-life, well acted and with stunning special effects.

Well I think I set my standards too high because when I left the movies I really disappointed. Number one, what happend to nightcrawler? He sort of just disappeared which really sucked because he was my favorite character. And then Scott dies, or at least I think he did. Whatever, he wasn't in the movie for more than five mintues. And then they kind of made it a lot about Jean Grey which is kind of idiotic because it really isn't about her at all and it annoyed the crap out of me. And I didn't expect the same polt of the comic book but I kind of expected the same great polt the other two movies had. Oh and another thing, Logan isn't that loving! Okay don't follow the comic book but at least get some of the character's personalities right. All in all I give this three and a half stars because even though I was disappointrf with it some of the parts I liked it and it was intense and very sad at times too. I just wished they didn't totally head in a different direction with this movie or it would have be so much better.

Eventually I decided to give it a shot on HD after hearing so much about the special effects, I expected to be wowed.There certainly are some eye popping and detailed special effects, unfortunately they are just gimmicks like Magneto's use of the Golden Gate bridge instead of well thought out Xmen effects.What can be said about the plot other than its old, tired, predictable and leads to some very stilted dialogue.  Not once in this movie is anyone surprised, nor is there even any tension.  Even as magneto rips the Golden Gate bridge off its foundation, most look on in a sense of 'meh'.Lastly the casting, presentation, story and acting of the Beast character is far worse than one could imagine in a big budget film.  While Frasier seems like a good choice for the Beast, it only works in voice over/cartoon format as actually seeing the aging Kelsey Grammar w/ the blue makeup and monkey suit is simply goofy.  His fight sequences with the stunt double are rough transitions that are not in any way believable.It was a gutsy call bringing an old character like the Beast to film, and one that clearly doesn't work at all.  Xmen 2's use of Nightcrawler was fantastic as that film gave him motivation, and a soul for a few moments along w/ amazing special effects.

The film has its own merits but lack of background on the ""Mutants"" (people with super powers) makes it pretty much like walking into the theater halfway through its running time.  At any rate, there are, for those who are familiar with the characters, various opportunities to watch the burning and freezing powers, the super strength, mind reading, and bridge moving mutants, to  label only a few types. There is even less room than in previous episodes for actors to show much individualized skill but the action scenes are entertaining, particularly in the free-for-all which marks the culmination of the series.Overall, if you  are starting the series, I would suggest going for the complete set.

Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry turn in their usual good performances.

And we see HUNDREDS of various mutants, including Beast, Leach, Callisto, ArcLight, Mulipleman... Well you get the point, but not one little hint of our favorite Cajun, Gambit.  Why was Remy left out AGAIN???? Argh!  To me this was the only drawback of the film.  I mean people, he WAS part of the Brotherhood, he could have just been inserted for a second in the damned forest! Any way, as I said, the acting is there, the action is there, the Shakespearen plot twists and Greek Family Tragedy theater is there.  And it is wonderful.  Unfortunately, Brett Ratner just isn't Bryan Singer.  That is good for the Girls, we see Storm as she was meant to be, the second in command, a weather Goddess and strong willed.  We see the Phoenix as she was supposed to be, and the guys kind of take a back seat, except for Xavier, Iceman, Magneto and Wolverine.SInger would have had a defter touch, but may not have given us the strong female leads we needed.Pros:1. Ian McKellan.  It is wonderful that he has come into his own in major blockbusters in the last decade.  It is a pity he didn't before.2. Patrick Stewart.  The only one able to hold his own against Sir Ian.  We need him knighted too.3. Strong Female leads.  The chicks rightly steal the film. From Mystique, ravaging Magneto as a woman seriously scorned, to Rogue deciding to be 'normal.' to Storm flying and letting loose, we finally see the Xwomen as they were originally drawn, if not dressed. I do like the new Storm hairdoo.  Much more 80's storm.4. Effects!  Damned if the the major effects scene in San Fran didn't rock the world!5. The Dangerroom with - you ready - Sentinels! Pay attention you will see one.6. Stunts and wirework.  Some of the best of the seasonCons:1. As I said, No Gambit.  Darn it!2. Some of the prosthetic costumes.  Vinnie Jones's as The Juggernaut is a main example.  In the future, when they make an 8 pack ab suit, they ought to take in account that we breath with our abdomens and have it move.  And the biceps need to flex in motion, not remain as they are.  It makes you disconnectWarning: Stay until the end of the credits ... There is a scene there that does negate the sworn promise that this is the final Xmen.  Hopefully, they will remember that after the box office take.  The final scene before the credits also hints at this.This is definitely a multiple viewing movie, there is a lot going on and it is truly a good closure to the first trilogy.  This franchise is far from dead, even if some of the Xmen are supposedly are.",5,Phoenix? Check! Action? Check! Danger Room?

JUGGERNAUT IS NOT A MUTANT!!!!  this is almost to the point of unacceptability.  althought i think that he had the best line in the movie.  colussus looked cool but very underdeveloped.  why did rogue have to take the cure, she has tried this in the past (comicwise anyway) and she has always gone in the opposite direction.  frustrating to say the least.  now the effects in the movie were pretty good.  the bridge scene is awesome.  what happened to cyclops?  where is he?  is he disintegrated?  i think that a fight with sentinels would have been a better movie.  just my opinion.  is this really the last team movie?  i hope not.  i did feel sorry for mystique in this one, just goes to show you how evil magneto is.  but it may look like the effects are only temporary.  so who knows what is going to happen.  also dont kill everyone in the movie, it may make for drama but that does not mean that the drama is good for the movie.  this is my rant and i am sticking to it.  i am frustrated because i am a loyal fan of the xmen and have thought that the last two xmen movies rank at the top of all time comic movies.  this one does not.  they messed with the system and they are messing with the core audience of the book.  i am aware that this is a movie and not the book, but those who make the movies should always remember that those who read the books are going to be the majority that see the movie.  i am an xmen purist and proud of it, i would just like to see respect given to the history of the book and what it stands for.  by the way stay till the end of the credits, apparently there is a scene at the end.",3,SPOILERS!!!!

1012350,ADKHI1TUGAX4,B000HCO83G,E. Anderson,"[2, 3]","I have been a big fan of the X-Men juggernaut from comic books to tv series. The first two X-Men films directed by Bryan Singer were surprisingly entertaining and captured the essence of the X-Men. Brett Ratner did not with the third X-Men film X3: The Last Stand. The general premise of the film revolves around a 'cure' for mutants created by Warren Worthington III's father. I couldn't help but draw comparison between this storyline with the ex-gay movement Exodus which claims to cure homosexuality. I think it would be difficult not to see this comparison between the Exodus movement and this cure to treat mutants and get rid of what humans perceived as to be a sickness. This 'cure' quickly stirs up strong emotions with Magneto and the Brotherhood as well as Charles Xavier and his X-Men, especially Storm, and eventually the two sides has one last final showdown.I admit I was pretty much entertained by the film but it was all flash and not a lot of substance. While I appreciated the fact that the screenwriters incorporated glimpses of the dark phoenix storyline where Jean Grey comes back to life but as a darker, more powerful character but for the most part the writing was mediocre at best. The writers totally veered away from the heart and soul of the comic book series. I didn't like seeing a few of the major characters be written off so quickly. The dialogue was extremely cheesy, more so than the previous X-Men films.What I did like was seeing a bit more of Colossus, one of my favorite X-Men characters (although not enough), more screen time for Halle Berry as Storm, the opening sequence where the young students are in danger room being trained in combat, and the special effects. Overall I was sorely disappointed. This is not the way I wanted this series to end.",3,Mildly entertaining,1162339200,"11 1, 2006",2006,1792,"['have', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'X-Men', 'juggernaut', 'comic', 'books', 'tv', 'series', 'first', 'two', 'X-Men', 'films', 'directed', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'were', 'surprisingly', 'entertaining', 'captured', 'essence', 'X-Men', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'did', 'not', 'third', 'X-Men', 'film', 'X3', 'Last', 'Stand', 'general', 'premise', 'film', 'around', ""'cure"", 'mutants', 'created', 'Warren', 'Worthington', 'III', 'father', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'draw', 'comparison', 'storyline', 'ex-gay', 'movement', 'Exodus', 'cure', 'homosexuality', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'not', 'see', 'comparison', 'Exodus', 'movement', 'cure', 'treat', 'mutants', 'get', 'rid', 'what', 'perceived', 'be', 'sickness', ""'cure"", 'quickly', 'up', 'strong', 'emotions', 'Magneto', 'Brotherhood', 'as', 'well', 'Charles', 'Xavier', 'X-Men', 'especially', 'Storm', 'eventually', 'two', 'sides', 'one', 'last', 'final', 'showdown.I', 'admit', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'entertained', 'film', 'was', 'flash', 'not', 'lot', 'substance', 'appreciated', 'fact', 'screenwriters', 'incorporated', 'glimpses', 'dark', 'phoenix', 'storyline', 'where', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'back', 'life', 'darker', 'more', 'powerful', 'character', 'most', 'part', 'writing', 'was', 'mediocre', 'best', 'writers', 'totally', 'veered', 'away', 'heart', 'soul', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'seeing', 'few', 'major', 'characters', 'be', 'written', 'off', 'so', 'quickly', 'dialogue', 'was', 'extremely', 'cheesy', 'more', 'so', 'previous', 'X-Men', 'films.What', 'did', 'like', 'was', 'seeing', 'bit', 'more', 'Colossus', 'one', 'favorite', 'X-Men', 'characters', 'not', 'enough', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Storm', 'opening', 'sequence', 'where', 'young', 'students', 'are', 'danger', 'room', 'being', 'trained', 'combat', 'special', 'effects', 'Overall', 'was', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'not', 'way', 'wanted', 'series', 'end']",N/A

Day ""ENIGMA""","[6, 10]","Yea Yea i know, probably not what you wanted to hear and it doesn't agree with a number of others that say that Last Stand was a monument of cinematic greatness. Truth of the matter is, it wasn't... Plain and simple. This movie was just another example of a man (Stan Lee) who takes a great idea (the comic book movie franchise) and simply bastardizes the concept toward an end of making the all mighty dollar, at the expense of the fans, that have helped make him the billionaire that he is today; knowing that due to his having legions of fans looking forward to the sequel, he realizes that he can put out any old piece of lukewarm unimaginative garbage, and people will scarf it down like Starr Jones at a Fried Chicken buffet (sadly this concept was mastered by George Lucas but i wont get sidetracked on my feelings on him and Star Wars).You might ask where does the shortcoming of this movie reveal itself? Well, being an action movie loving buff, had someone told me character development was important to the flow of a movie, id have told them ""Oh shove it bookworm, all i need is some explosions, violence and action, and ill be happy"". Well, let me tell ya, Last Stand has made me a believer. When you can take some of my favorite characters (i.e. Wolverine and Professor X)and make them boring, clearly someone has done something horribly wrong. Word is, Halle Berry complained over all the time Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) got in the past movies, and declared to get more time in this sequel (or she'd walk), which she got. Yet, once again we watch as Berry gives lukewarm acting, as Storm is continually slapped around like Mike Tyson versus a thirteen year old girl.Much like the other X-Men movies i could go into how Stan skews off the true storyline of the comic (but needless to say we all know he's done that in every installment of every comic movie he's made) so i wont bore you with things you already know (this pattern is once again repeated in Last Stand).Yes the special effects are great, the story good (there is a new Vaccine that when injected can allegedly cancel the mutant gene and turn mutants into regular powerless humans). Yet, the movie plays out like a tragic soap opera leaving you at the end feeling betrayed and disappointed. I wont tell you the X-Men that get killed off so as to leave some surprise to you the viewer. However, one of those killed you probably wont care about, the other, hell was already dead, and the other, for all intensive purposes is and always will be the heart of the X-Men, thus making killing him completly incompetent.And yea I know as i write this you're thinking I'm a jerk, and will likely watch it if for nothing else..... closure. So enjoy, if you can... I personally will be looking forward to the New X-related movies that are in production (movies about Wolverines and Magneto's Beginnings)... and will pray that Stan Lee will not do to them what he has done to my once beloved X-Men.",2,The 'X' is for eXtremely Overrated,1160265600,"10 8, 2006",2006,2961,"['Yea', 'Yea', 'i', 'know', 'probably', 'not', 'what', 'wanted', 'hear', ""n't"", 'agree', 'number', 'others', 'say', 'Last', 'Stand', 'was', 'monument', 'cinematic', 'greatness', 'Truth', 'matter', 'was', ""n't"", 'Plain', 'simple', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'example', 'man', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'who', 'great', 'idea', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'franchise', 'simply', 'bastardizes', 'concept', 'end', 'making', 'mighty', 'dollar', 'expense', 'fans', 'have', 'helped', 'make', 'billionaire', 'today', 'knowing', 'due', 'having', 'legions', 'fans', 'looking', 'forward', 'sequel', 'can', 'put', 'out', 'old', 'piece', 'lukewarm', 'unimaginative', 'garbage', 'people', 'will', 'scarf', 'down', 'Starr', 'Jones', 'Fried', 'Chicken', 'buffet', 'sadly', 'concept', 'was', 'mastered', 'George', 'Lucas', 'i', 'wont', 'get', 'sidetracked', 'feelings', 'Star', 'Wars', '.You', 'might', 'ask', 'where', 'shortcoming', 'movie', 'reveal', 'Well', 'being', 'action', 'movie', 'loving', 'buff', 'had', 'someone', 'told', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'important', 'flow', 'movie', 'id', 'have', 'told', 'Oh', 'shove', 'bookworm', 'i', 'need', 'explosions', 'violence', 'action', 'ill', 'be', 'happy', 'Well', 'let', 'tell', 'ya', 'Last', 'Stand', 'made', 'believer', 'When', 'can', 'take', 'favorite', 'characters', 'i.e', 'Wolverine', 'Professor', 'X', 'make', 'boring', 'clearly', 'someone', 'done', 'something', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'Word', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'complained', 'time', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Wolverine', 'got', 'past', 'movies', 'declared', 'get', 'more', 'time', 'sequel', ""'d"", 'walk', 'got', 'once', 'again', 'watch', 'Berry', 'lukewarm', 'acting', 'Storm', 'continually', 'slapped', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'thirteen', 'year', 'old', 'girl.Much', 'other', 'X-Men', 'movies', 'i', 'could', 'go', 'how', 'Stan', 'skews', 'true', 'storyline', 'comic', 'needless', 'say', 'know', 'done', 'installment', 'comic', 'movie', 'made', 'i', 'wont', 'things', 'already', 'know', 'pattern', 'once', 'again', 'repeated', 'Last', 'Stand', '.Yes', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'great', 'story', 'good', 'new', 'Vaccine', 'when', 'injected', 'can', 'allegedly', 'cancel', 'mutant', 'gene', 'turn', 'mutants', 'regular', 'powerless', 'humans', 'movie', 'out', 'tragic', 'soap', 'opera', 'leaving', 'end', 'feeling', 'betrayed', 'disappointed', 'wont', 'tell', 'X-Men', 'get', 'killed', 'off', 'so', 'leave', 'surprise', 'viewer', 'However', 'one', 'killed', 'probably', 'wont', 'care', 'other', 'hell', 'was', 'already', 'dead', 'other', 'intensive', 'purposes', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'heart', 'X-Men', 'thus', 'making', 'killing', 'completly', 'incompetent.And', 'yea', 'know', 'i', 'write', ""'re"", 'thinking', ""'m"", 'jerk', 'will', 'likely', 'watch', 'nothing', 'else', '..', 'closure', 'So', 'enjoy', 'can', 'personally', 'will', 'be', 'looking', 'forward', 'New', 'X-related', 'movies', 'are', 'production', 'movies', 'Wolverines', 'Magneto', 'Beginnings', 'will', 'pray', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'will', 'not', 'do', 'what', 'done', 'once', 'beloved', 'X-Men']",N/A

But, are we given the grand finale we deserve? No.While the first movie served simply as exposition to introduce the conflicts and motives of this well-drawn cast, the second movie laid it all out and showed film audiences what comic book readers knew for decades: the X-Men are powerful, amazing, and very tragic characters, which makes them very human.In The Final Stand, we are given a glimpse at how unethical Xavier can be, how vain Magneto really is, and how stern Storm can come off. But what highlights this film, and makes it even a little enjoyable, is the chemistry between lost soul Jean Grey (played PERFECTLY by Famke Jensen) and unrequited lover Logan (returning fav Hugh Jackman.) Not to mention a fanboy's dream script incorporating elements and images from  X-Tales like Days of Future Past, Planet X, the cartoon episode 'The Cure', and of course, The Dark Phoenix Saga.As a fan of these stories for 15 years now, I can say that the spirit and message of X-Men was fullfilled with the trilogy, but The Final Stand did not meet up to expectations.  One could blame last minute director Brett Ratner for pushing the film along at a pace that doesn't allow for thought, or the screenwriters for trying to do TOO much in one film.  When Cyclops is reunited with his beloved, believed dead and gone, their reunion is almost watered down. Yes there is shock. Yes there is confusion. Yes there is joy. But that scene alone flows like there was a checklist, like they had to hit these feelings and move on. And the whole movie comes across like that. So, I credit this movie for telling a great story, but it loses point after point for how poorly at times it tells that story. Most likely, 20th Century Fox's demand to have the film out Memorial Day 2006 gave the production team too little time to fine tune what could have been a masterpiece.Casual moviegoers will love it.  Plenty of action, special effects, romance (however complicated), comedy, and a good theme.Comic fans either embrace it or loathe it.  But this isn't a comic.  This is a movie, and a decent one to be sure.  It's just not a great one.As far as DVD features, the Collector's Edition's where it's at.",3,The Supreme X-Men Story...on A.D.D.,1155600000,"08 15, 2006",2006,2360,"['worthwhile', 'film', 'trilogies', 'themes', 'character', 'arcs', 'established', '2000', 'X-Men', 'come', 'fruition', 'final', 'movie', 'installmant', 'Marvel', 'famous', 'mutants', 'are', 'given', 'grand', 'finale', 'deserve', 'first', 'movie', 'served', 'simply', 'exposition', 'introduce', 'conflicts', 'motives', 'well-drawn', 'cast', 'second', 'movie', 'laid', 'out', 'showed', 'film', 'audiences', 'what', 'comic', 'book', 'readers', 'knew', 'decades', 'X-Men', 'are', 'powerful', 'amazing', 'very', 'tragic', 'characters', 'very', 'human.In', 'Final', 'Stand', 'are', 'given', 'glimpse', 'how', 'unethical', 'Xavier', 'can', 'be', 'how', 'vain', 'Magneto', 'really', 'how', 'stern', 'Storm', 'can', 'come', 'off', 'what', 'film', 'even', 'little', 'enjoyable', 'chemistry', 'lost', 'soul', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'played', 'PERFECTLY', 'Famke', 'Jensen', 'unrequited', 'lover', 'Logan', 'returning', 'fav', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Not', 'mention', 'fanboy', 'dream', 'script', 'incorporating', 'elements', 'images', 'X-Tales', 'Days', 'Future', 'Past', 'Planet', 'X', 'cartoon', 'episode', ""'The"", 'Cure', 'course', 'Dark', 'Phoenix', 'Saga.As', 'fan', 'stories', '15', 'years', 'now', 'can', 'say', 'spirit', 'message', 'X-Men', 'was', 'fullfilled', 'trilogy', 'Final', 'Stand', 'did', 'not', 'meet', 'up', 'expectations', 'One', 'could', 'blame', 'last', 'minute', 'director', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'pushing', 'film', 'along', 'pace', ""n't"", 'allow', 'thought', 'screenwriters', 'trying', 'do', 'TOO', 'much', 'one', 'film', 'When', 'Cyclops', 'reunited', 'beloved', 'believed', 'dead', 'gone', 'reunion', 'almost', 'watered', 'down', 'Yes', 'shock', 'Yes', 'confusion', 'Yes', 'joy', 'scene', 'alone', 'was', 'checklist', 'had', 'hit', 'feelings', 'move', 'whole', 'movie', 'So', 'credit', 'movie', 'telling', 'great', 'story', 'point', 'point', 'how', 'poorly', 'times', 'story', 'Most', 'likely', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'demand', 'have', 'film', 'out', 'Memorial', 'Day', '2006', 'gave', 'production', 'team', 'too', 'little', 'time', 'fine', 'tune', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'masterpiece.Casual', 'moviegoers', 'will', 'love', 'Plenty', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'romance', 'however', 'complicated', 'comedy', 'good', 'theme.Comic', 'fans', 'embrace', 'loathe', ""n't"", 'comic', 'movie', 'decent', 'one', 'be', 'sure', 'just', 'not', 'great', 'one.As', 'far', 'DVD', 'features', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'where']",N/A

Where was Nightcrawler?The franchise is in trouble because the story line is getting weaker and repetative.  Magneto has been over used, if there is a 4th X-Men movie, I really hope that Magneto is not in the next movie.  There are so many other X-Men stories that would make fantastic movies.  Apocalypse.  Days of Future Past.  The list goes on and on.  More than likely, this will be the last X-Men as we know it.  Wolverine will get a spin-off movie, but it will most like be messed up because it will be a prequel flick instead of a newer story.

1012354,AR04V3G7TR8VV,B000HCO83G,Elric M. Kline,"[1, 1]","This film could have been another ""Empire Strikes Back."" With a bleakly tragic plot line and a devastating list of casualties, it could have described the heart-wrenching tragedy that inevitably unravels at the core of the greatest sagas.They had all the right pieces. A daunting, uncontrollable new power in the form of the Phoenix, with the obvious implication that the Professor's fearful meddling in young Jean's mind is at least partly responsible for her untamed alter-ego. Doubting himself--not as a telepath, but as a teacher--Xavier had locked off the parts of her power that he believed could not be educated. Thus hidden from her conscious mind, this power had the freedom to become the Phoenix, a selfish and destructive creature possessing nearly unimaginable power.Meanwhile, a major pharmaceutical company develops a ""cure"" for the mutant condition, sharply dividing the mutant community and providing the banner around which Magneto can build his own army of angry mutants. The government, of course, has weaponized the ""cure"" using plastic darts that take only seconds to incapacitate their target.Again, all of the right pieces for a genuine tragedy for our X-Men. Betrayal, fallen friends, hopeless odds. I loved this story. I could have enjoyed this pain... but they just would not let me.On a dramatic level, the film falls flat. Director Brett Ratner comes across as amateurish and unoriginal, while choppy editing and rush-job writing whisk us through a dazzling array of scenes with virtually no dramatic impact. Meanwhile, writers and director simply refused to tug at the nagging loose threads of their own story. The most glaring example? Xavier, who may not have deserved to die, certainly made his own death-bed. Despite a weakly-drawn confrontation with Wolverine, however, not to mention punchy but thin accusations from Magneto, Xavier never admits his mistakes, never confronts his contradictions. Thus, he dies still pleading his pathetic paternalism to a Jean Grey already destroyed by his own manipulations. He dies with impotent stubbornness, with no dignity because he cannot escape his conceit. His death, while tragic, leaves a bitter taste in my mouth because he never managed to repent.If his death is sour, Xavier's memorial and the succeeding scenes are far worse. The memorial is brief and unremarkable; afterward, Hank discusses closing the school, an option that Storm all too quickly rejects. We are supposed to feel uplifted, hopeful that life goes on for the X-Men. Instead, I feel cheated, robbed of yet another chance to properly mourn the loss of an icon: we never get to absorb his death, to revel in the tragedy. Suddenly, things are simply back to normal.The narrative flow is practically non-existent: the story, while interesting, fails to build tension toward a dramatic climax. It is hardly helped by a flat and uninspired musical score.There was no need for the X-Men to ""win"" this battle. There was every reason, in fact, for them to lose. We might have left this story with Magneto and Phoenix ascendant, at the verge of true world conquest. Indeed, this would have provided the escalation necessary to make the Sentinels a reality, to launch this movie franchise wholesale into the bleak and unapologetic world of the X-Men comics.Instead, we get Hank McCoy, ambassador to the UN. We get a world in which, for no convincing reason, human and mutant suddenly get along. Yes, the X-Men saved the world (again) from Magneto, and they defeated the seemingly unstoppable Phoenix... but are we really supposed to believe that human paranoia gives in that easily?The actors, for the most part, did a superb job with a lousy script. Ellen Page was especially notable for a very honest, very relatable Kitty Pryde--I wish we had seen more of her.I loved this story. I love a good tragedy.

And this is a review of the BLU-RAY technology of this film and not so much the story line of the film itself.  I actually own them on standard DVD, so I recently saw XMen-The Last Stand on blu-ray on an 1080p TV and I can tell you that blu-ray in 1080p will enhance tiny flaws and make them obvious.  I notice this with other movies of this type (F4RSS - Fantasic Four Rise...) and the digital effects are so noticeable that they look fake.  In the XMen, when Magneto moves the golden gate bridge it didn't look convincing.  The actors look like actors on a stage and the bridge look fake, the cars sliding on the bridge looks as if they were being pulled by wires and I think I know why.  Because the scene looks so clean that it didn't look like it was actually taking place outside, but rather inside of a computer.  Now don't get me wrong, I love blu-ray and it works great for some films, but in this movie, things look so disconnected.  Now on the otherhand when I reduced the resolution to 1080i, it looked remarkably more real.  But at 1080p on a 50"" plasma, 47"" LCD and a 65"" plasma, it looks like XMEN the Play instead of Xmen the movie.

1012363,AYWAY5MKLAITN,B000HCO83G,Film Noir Fedora,"[0, 2]","X-men the last stand is a movie that was highly anticipated since X2: Mutants United. Going in, I felt a very high tense moment thinking that this movie would be bad. But, as always, I knew that whether bad or good to me, to another person it would be totally different. I've read only a few, maybe about twenty or so, of the original x-men comics so I think that chances are that this movie will most likely be ripped apart from that fan-base. I'm sure there will be things that they liked and did not like.For me, X-men last stand truely stuck out as the end of the trilogy but not necessarily the end of the concept. Lord knows that they have Wolverine, Magneto, and the students spin-offs in the works.This movie doesn't pick up right where it left off, but rather jumps back and forth in time to give us some new information regarding the surrounding characters. Wolverine looks the same if not a little more gruffier in the last two movies. But, sadly, some parts were trimmed down in order to fit everyone in. That aspect is the one that I didn't like about this film. They crammed too many characters in with very little screen time if any.Although, I will say that ""Beast""(Kelsey Gramer) was born to play that role and is needed in this movie. He plays a pivitol role between politician and mutant, which is a clever twist considering that his name is beast.As for the story, I think it was well-crafted, workable, intriguing. Epic? Well . . . almost epic. They could've made the movie longer and they could've added more mutants and given them more screen time. Plus, there were shocks in this movie that I wasn't ready for. But I will say that it held my attention and it convinced me to stay. I would say that it is just a notch below Epic. It's more in the ""Grand"" scale if you ask me.Some say that the characters didn't have enough depth to them.

While the ending was exciting and full of actions, the first 2/3 movie was not so great.  On certain movies, I don't much care for character building or great plots.  I just want to be entertained.  Well, the first 2/3 of the Last Stand failed to do so in my opinion.  In fact, I actually saw two people walk out.  Even I was getting bored.  There were too much talking and explaining that was not needed.  I am guessing that the actors wanted to show their acting skills.  Now for those two who walked out, they missed an exciting ending.  There were great actions and wonderful graphics, which I was accustomed to from the other Marvel movies.  If I had to compare the Last Stand to another movie, then I would have to go with ""DOOM"".  Just like ""DOOM"", nothing worth while happened until the end.  In summary, I have bought the first two X-Men movies, but I am not planning to buy the Last Stand.

I understood the plot and what the film was trying to tell us through symbolism the way an X-Men story should.

Characters have died in the comics and came back, and the small clip at the end of the credits of this movie proves that dead doesn't always mean dead.I thought they made good use of the special effects of the film. One of the most beautiful parts of the movie was watching Angel fly over the bridge. The special effects really came in use at the exciting battle scene towards the end of the movie. You hear about the war coming in the previous two movies and now it is finally hear and it makes for a good watch that isn't boring.The acting is also as great as in the other films as well.

Are you stupid? do you even know what a director does? He has no choice when it comes to story! The film makers had no choice but to kill cyclops off because the actor that plays him was off with the original director making ""Superman Returns."" So if you want to blame someone for why cyclops dies in x3, blame Bryan Singer! He's the one who chose to not finish what he started! Blame actor James Mardesen, who signed on for the most worthless role in his life, playing Louis Lane's husband in a movie that was a complete downer! Bryan Singer really screwed up going for that superman movie instead on finishing his X-Men trilogy. If you listen to the audio commentary, the producers say, we had to limit cyclops' role because James was off making superman returns and was barely around to film. There you go! Stop blaming Bret Ratner for God's sake because all it shows is your ignorance!!I know what you are thinking. They should have hired another actor but it's not that easy. There are contractual obligations and if they wanted to use another actor they would have to pay James Mardesen thousands of dollars, which a movie studio never wants to do because they constantly want to save money and not go over budget. For example, when they killed Michael Bein off in ""Alien 3"" they had to pay him thousands of dollars! He made more money off dying off screen in ""Alien 3"" than his whole performance in ""Aliens""! X3 has that ""Alien 3"" curse on it, where it's a good movie but there was so much standing in its way that it's not what fans expected.The only redeeming qualities of this film are Kelsey Grammar as beast and Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde. What a waste. I wish i could magically transport their performances into x1 or x2 but not even they could make this film very watchable. Halle Berry and Hugh were great too but that ordeal with Cyclops is like a thorn to my side and i can't get over it.what i hate more than what happened to Cyclops that didn't involve hollywood politics is what they did to rogue. Having her character take the cure goes against everything the x men stand for and with that i can tell you these screenplay writers don't have a clue and are blasphemous when it comes to x men. the x men are all about accepting yourself as you are and learning to control your powers!!! even in the audio commentery the writers say that the ending where she doesn't take the cure is for Rogue fans, so wouldn't they have put that in the film!!? their reasoning was because ""it sucks that she can't get with nobody."" what a bunch of morons. this was like watching someone piss on a church and it hurt me, more than the death of cyclops.Also the ending is ridiculous so magento who is the equivelant of osama bin laden is just sitting in the park playing chess and no one takes notice even though he was terrorizing the whole country and hundreds of soldiers died on alcatraz!? So, the cure still exists and everyone is happy? so jean come back only to...die again? this film was pointless. blame the screenwriters and the producers but not bret ratner.",2,"Controversial, Pointless, and a Blasphemous Perversion of what the X-Men stand for",1282262400,"08 20, 2010",2010,3283,"['film', 'was', 'doomed', 'as', 'soon', 'James', 'Mardesen', 'signed', 'be', 'Louis', 'Lane', 'husband', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'forced', 'writers', 'kill', 'of.Folks', 'also', 'really', 'need', 'stop', 'blaming', 'Bret', 'Ratner', 'Cyclops', 'death', 'Are', 'stupid', 'do', 'even', 'know', 'what', 'director', 'choice', 'when', 'story', 'film', 'makers', 'had', 'choice', 'kill', 'cyclops', 'actor', 'was', 'off', 'original', 'director', 'making', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'So', 'want', 'blame', 'someone', 'why', 'cyclops', 'dies', 'x3', 'blame', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'one', 'who', 'chose', 'not', 'finish', 'what', 'started', 'Blame', 'actor', 'James', 'Mardesen', 'who', 'signed', 'most', 'worthless', 'role', 'life', 'playing', 'Louis', 'Lane', 'husband', 'movie', 'was', 'complete', 'downer', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'really', 'screwed', 'up', 'going', 'superman', 'movie', 'instead', 'finishing', 'X-Men', 'trilogy', 'listen', 'audio', 'commentary', 'producers', 'say', 'had', 'limit', 'cyclops', 'role', 'James', 'was', 'off', 'making', 'superman', 'returns', 'was', 'barely', 'film', 'go', 'Stop', 'blaming', 'Bret', 'Ratner', 'God', 'sake', 'ignorance', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'thinking', 'should', 'have', 'hired', 'actor', 'not', 'easy', 'are', 'contractual', 'obligations', 'wanted', 'use', 'actor', 'would', 'have', 'pay', 'James', 'Mardesen', 'thousands', 'dollars', 'movie', 'studio', 'never', 'do', 'constantly', 'want', 'save', 'money', 'not', 'go', 'over', 'budget', 'example', 'when', 'killed', 'Michael', 'Bein', 'off', 'Alien', '3', 'had', 'pay', 'thousands', 'dollars', 'made', 'more', 'money', 'dying', 'off', 'screen', 'Alien', '3', 'whole', 'performance', 'Aliens', 'X3', 'Alien', '3', 'curse', 'where', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'standing', 'way', 'not', 'what', 'expected.The', 'only', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'film', 'are', 'Kelsey', 'Grammar', 'beast', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'Kitty', 'Pryde', 'What', 'waste', 'wish', 'i', 'could', 'magically', 'transport', 'performances', 'x1', 'x2', 'not', 'even', 'could', 'make', 'film', 'very', 'watchable', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Hugh', 'were', 'great', 'too', 'ordeal', 'Cyclops', 'thorn', 'side', 'i', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'i', 'hate', 'more', 'what', 'happened', 'Cyclops', 'did', ""n't"", 'involve', 'hollywood', 'politics', 'what', 'did', 'rogue', 'Having', 'character', 'take', 'cure', 'everything', 'x', 'men', 'stand', 'i', 'can', 'tell', 'screenplay', 'writers', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'are', 'blasphemous', 'when', 'x', 'men', 'x', 'men', 'are', 'accepting', 'are', 'learning', 'control', 'powers', 'even', 'audio', 'commentery', 'writers', 'say', 'ending', 'where', ""n't"", 'take', 'cure', 'Rogue', 'fans', 'so', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'put', 'film', 'reasoning', 'was', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'nobody', 'what', 'bunch', 'morons', 'was', 'watching', 'someone', 'piss', 'church', 'hurt', 'more', 'death', 'cyclops.Also', 'ending', 'ridiculous', 'so', 'who', 'equivelant', 'osama', 'bin', 'laden', 'just', 'sitting', 'park', 'playing', 'chess', 'one', 'notice', 'even', 'was', 'terrorizing', 'whole', 'country', 'hundreds', 'soldiers', 'died', 'alcatraz', 'So', 'cure', 'still', 'everyone', 'happy', 'so', 'jean', 'come', 'back', 'only', 'die', 'again', 'film', 'was', 'pointless', 'blame', 'screenwriters', 'producers', 'not', 'bret', 'ratner']",N/A

The premise of ""X-3"" held so much promise and yet failed to deliver anything of substance beyond some impressive looking, yet still somehow bland, battle sequences.  Without giving away details, the death of certain important characters pass by producing a lack of emotional response from an audience that should more properly be devastated, not merely thinking ""Gee . . . what a bummer.""The manner in which the Dark Phoenix was presented was mind numbingly bad.  Astonishingly bad.  Bad, bad, bad.  (Did I mention it was bad?)  Instead of the soul tortured Jean returning and unleashing her demonic powers, we have Famke Jannsen with contact lensed googly eyes while it looks like she's being poked from behind with a cattle prod.  Yeah, there's some intense drama for you.The only real ""fun"" in the movie (if it can be called that) is watching the increasingly insane behavior of Magneto.  Ian McKellen almost realizes there's no way to play this but waaaaay over the top . . . and thank God, for him.As Beast, Kelsey Grammer makes a brilliant debut to the X-series, however not even he can charm his way through some of the most inane dialogue written - even for a comic book movie.  Still, Grammer's Beast is wicked cool!The dialogue throughout seems to have been written by high school fans and shows remarkably little respect for the intelligence of either the films characters, or the audience cajoled into watching this mess.  One perfect example of this occurs when, as preparing to battle Magneto and his enormous forces, Iceman tells Wolverine something like ""But there's only a handful of us against all of them"" to which Wolverine responds ""I'm not going to lie to you. We are outnumbered.""  Oh, really?Jackman is always fun and his Wolverine remains probably the coolest character to make the transition from comic book to screen, but he figures too prominently here - and even he can't save this mess.Its runtime of just over 90 minutes doesn't help either - everything blurs together too quickly with little time for development, which means little empathy from the audience.

But given that stance, watching this very colorful film was an art study in how far computer generated graphics have come in a relatively short time. And that makes the time spent on the non-story worthwhile.Of course it is always a pleasure to see Sir Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Rebecca Romijn, James Marsden, Patrick Stewart, and the newly buff Ben Foster in action: nice costume effects despite overdone makeup etc.  But the story is so slim that it can be ignored and the viewer can watch the rather extraordinary special effects - until they ultimately wear thin (as when the house lifts off the ground, etc!).  So advice for those fellow viewers who avoid these Marvel Comic movies: drop the prejudice long enough to see what is au courante in special effects.  It is rather entertaining...for a while.

I really don't understand the stupid bellyaching against the movie. The special effects were great, the acting was good, and the dialogue while nothing sophisticated fit the movie perfectly.The plot is similar to the other movies, the X-MEN do battle against Magneto's mutants and himself once again. The twist here is that an anti-mutant gene or antidote is being made from one mutant. This will turn the mutants human. Of course the moral tale is brought here once again for the mutants being a ""disease"".Ratner like Singer does a good job of setting up the action and tension as well as one director can having directed the profitably successful ""Rush Hour"" movies Ratner really didn't disappoint whatsoever with the exception of perhaps giving a deeper profile of the Sentinels.The Dark Phoenix, Jean Grey's alter ego comes to life and destroys everyone in her path, Magneto seizes the opportunity but even he doesn't realize the dangerous powers she has.It was also great seeing the other new X-MEN in here including Kitty Pryde , Beast, Archangel and other mutants like Juggernaut. Famke Jansen is very good here and sexy as always, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine again knows hot to hit the mark as Wolverine and Ian Ian McKellen in his last stint as Magneto is terrificThis is a good old smashmouth action comic book film like the last one and I have to say if this is the last movie that I was pretty satisfied with the work everything did on the movie.",5,A decent hit for X-MEN Fans,1151452800,"06 28, 2006",2006,1585,"['Brett', 'Ratner', 'good', 'job', 'delivering', 'action', 'packed', 'third', 'entry', 'comic', 'series', 'X-MEN', 'III', 'Last', 'Stand', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'stupid', 'bellyaching', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'great', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'dialogue', 'nothing', 'sophisticated', 'fit', 'movie', 'perfectly.The', 'plot', 'similar', 'other', 'movies', 'X-MEN', 'do', 'battle', 'Magneto', 'mutants', 'once', 'again', 'twist', 'here', 'anti-mutant', 'gene', 'antidote', 'being', 'made', 'one', 'mutant', 'will', 'turn', 'mutants', 'human', 'course', 'moral', 'tale', 'brought', 'here', 'once', 'again', 'mutants', 'being', 'disease', '.Ratner', 'Singer', 'good', 'job', 'setting', 'up', 'action', 'tension', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'director', 'can', 'having', 'directed', 'profitably', 'successful', 'Rush', 'Hour', 'movies', 'Ratner', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'whatsoever', 'exception', 'perhaps', 'giving', 'deeper', 'profile', 'Sentinels.The', 'Dark', 'Phoenix', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'alter', 'ego', 'life', 'everyone', 'path', 'Magneto', 'opportunity', 'even', ""n't"", 'realize', 'dangerous', 'powers', 'has.It', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'seeing', 'other', 'new', 'X-MEN', 'here', 'including', 'Kitty', 'Pryde', 'Beast', 'Archangel', 'other', 'mutants', 'Juggernaut', 'Famke', 'Jansen', 'very', 'good', 'here', 'sexy', 'always', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Wolverine', 'again', 'hot', 'hit', 'mark', 'Wolverine', 'Ian', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'last', 'stint', 'Magneto', 'terrificThis', 'good', 'old', 'smashmouth', 'action', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'last', 'one', 'have', 'say', 'last', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'satisfied', 'work', 'everything', 'did', 'movie']",N/A

Any essay on the correspondence between lowering IQs and rising low-brow entertainment should rightfully include this series of films. Where the first two were intelligent metaphors for the world in which we live, the third is a meaningless action sequence that serves as a backdrop to poor performances, weak dialogue and overwrought cliche. (Let me clear, it even fails as an action sequence - the opening night crowd I saw the film with were derisively hissing the bridge sequence by the films... er, ""climax."")Where the first two greeted the audience with a knowing wink, the third merely throws garbage at the audience without regard to character development or plot.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 5]","A cure has been found for the ""disease"" of having mutative genes and this cure is offered to any mutant desirous of being normal. Very quickly, this becomes a hot-button issue for non-mutants and mutants alike as the all-important question surfaces: does being a mutant constitute being diseased? Magneto, not only a mutant advocate but one who believes that mutants are the superior life form on earth, vehemently wants nothing of the cure and, in fact, seeks to annihilate the root of the cure - that being a little boy named Jimmy (Leech), himself a mutant who nullifies other mutants' powers. Magneto also continues to gather his power base, from which to wage his ongoing war against the ""lesser"" humanity. Simultaneous to these events, Jean Grey returns, but oh so terribly altered. She is now styled the (Dark) Phoenix and her psychic and telekinetic powers have increased exponentially and are controlled by an amoral persona. The ever beleaguered X-Men find themselves at a crossroad. Due to a catastrophic tragedy, the Xavier School for Gifted Students is in dire jeopardy of closing. Further, The X-Men are divided with the issue of the cure. Some, like Storm, believe there is nothing wrong with being a mutant. Some, like Rogue, just wants to fit in. But in the end, the X-Men must once more band together and protect humanity from Magneto's assaults.X-Men - The Last Stand pulls no punches. Key characters bite the big one in this possibly final installment, raising the angst level (as if it needed it) to new heights. X-Men has always been the comic book standard bearer for social issues and racial dynamics and this second sequel begs the question: what qualifies as humanity? And in comic book reality, with the supposition that mutants are real, as a ""normal"", how does one differentiate between persecution and self-preservation? Weighty matters for those who want to delve a little deeper. Me, I watch X-Men for the cool special effects.And what of the special effects? They are expertly awesome. The movie screen seems to show something impossible every 2 minutes and yet, these scenes are conveyed with fantastic realism. If a man could fly, if a woman could control the weather, if a man could manipulate metal - well, this is how it would look.I so enjoyed this movie, from start to finish. The principal actors have had 2 prior films to get to know their roles and by this third outing, they embody their characters with easy conviction. The movie's focus is again firmly on Wolverine and why not, as he's got his own film lined up? But Prof. Xavier, Storm, Magneto and Jean Grey are also given decent camera time. Secondary roles of import are Hank McCoy (the Beast), Bobby Drake (Iceman), and Kitty Pryde (Shadowcat). The cast of X-Men, the Brotherhood and other mutants is so large that short thrift is given to many characters. I wish more time had been devoted to Angel, Colossus, Mystique and Rogue. And I thought Multiple Man was a good guy? And where's Nightcrawler?Things to look for:  Magneto's awesome levitation of a massive bridge; the erudite Beast finally unleashed; that old staple, the Colossus/Wolverine fastball; Iceman vs. Pyro; and my personal favorite, Kitty Pryde takes on the unstoppable Juggernaut.Here's hoping that there's a fourth X-Men and that Gambit and/or Longshot are in it.Helpful hint: stick around until after the closing credits, there's more movie.",5,this movie plays for keeps; 4 and a half stars,1150243200,"06 14, 2006",2006,3413,"['cure', 'been', 'found', 'disease', 'having', 'mutative', 'genes', 'cure', 'offered', 'mutant', 'desirous', 'being', 'normal', 'Very', 'quickly', 'hot-button', 'issue', 'non-mutants', 'mutants', 'alike', 'all-important', 'question', 'surfaces', 'being', 'mutant', 'constitute', 'being', 'diseased', 'Magneto', 'not', 'only', 'mutant', 'advocate', 'one', 'who', 'mutants', 'are', 'superior', 'life', 'form', 'earth', 'vehemently', 'nothing', 'cure', 'fact', 'annihilate', 'root', 'cure', 'being', 'little', 'boy', 'named', 'Jimmy', 'Leech', 'mutant', 'who', 'other', 'mutants', 'powers', 'Magneto', 'also', 'gather', 'power', 'base', 'wage', 'ongoing', 'war', 'lesser', 'humanity', 'Simultaneous', 'events', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'returns', 'oh', 'so', 'terribly', 'altered', 'now', 'styled', 'Dark', 'Phoenix', 'psychic', 'telekinetic', 'powers', 'have', 'increased', 'exponentially', 'are', 'controlled', 'amoral', 'persona', 'ever', 'beleaguered', 'X-Men', 'find', 'crossroad', 'Due', 'catastrophic', 'tragedy', 'Xavier', 'School', 'Gifted', 'Students', 'dire', 'jeopardy', 'closing', 'Further', 'X-Men', 'are', 'divided', 'issue', 'cure', 'Storm', 'believe', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'being', 'mutant', 'Rogue', 'just', 'fit', 'end', 'X-Men', 'must', 'once', 'more', 'band', 'together', 'protect', 'humanity', 'Magneto', 'assaults.X-Men', 'Last', 'Stand', 'punches', 'Key', 'characters', 'bite', 'big', 'one', 'possibly', 'final', 'installment', 'raising', 'angst', 'level', 'needed', 'new', 'heights', 'X-Men', 'always', 'been', 'comic', 'book', 'standard', 'bearer', 'social', 'issues', 'racial', 'dynamics', 'second', 'sequel', 'question', 'what', 'humanity', 'comic', 'book', 'reality', 'supposition', 'mutants', 'are', 'real', 'normal', 'how', 'one', 'differentiate', 'persecution', 'self-preservation', 'Weighty', 'matters', 'who', 'want', 'delve', 'little', 'deeper', 'Me', 'watch', 'X-Men', 'cool', 'special', 'effects.And', 'what', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'expertly', 'awesome', 'movie', 'screen', 'show', 'something', 'impossible', '2', 'minutes', 'yet', 'scenes', 'are', 'conveyed', 'fantastic', 'realism', 'man', 'could', 'fly', 'woman', 'could', 'control', 'weather', 'man', 'could', 'manipulate', 'metal', 'well', 'how', 'would', 'look.I', 'so', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'start', 'finish', 'principal', 'actors', 'have', 'had', '2', 'prior', 'films', 'get', 'know', 'roles', 'third', 'outing', 'embody', 'characters', 'easy', 'conviction', 'movie', 'focus', 'again', 'firmly', 'Wolverine', 'why', 'not', 'got', 'own', 'film', 'lined', 'up', 'Prof.', 'Xavier', 'Storm', 'Magneto', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'are', 'also', 'given', 'decent', 'camera', 'time', 'Secondary', 'roles', 'import', 'are', 'Hank', 'McCoy', 'Beast', 'Bobby', 'Drake', 'Iceman', 'Kitty', 'Pryde', 'Shadowcat', 'cast', 'X-Men', 'Brotherhood', 'other', 'mutants', 'so', 'large', 'short', 'thrift', 'given', 'many', 'characters', 'wish', 'more', 'time', 'had', 'been', 'devoted', 'Angel', 'Colossus', 'Mystique', 'Rogue', 'thought', 'Multiple', 'Man', 'was', 'good', 'guy', 'where', 'Nightcrawler', 'Things', 'look', 'Magneto', 'awesome', 'levitation', 'massive', 'bridge', 'erudite', 'Beast', 'finally', 'unleashed', 'old', 'staple', 'Colossus/Wolverine', 'fastball', 'Iceman', 'Pyro', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Kitty', 'Pryde', 'unstoppable', 'Juggernaut.Here', 'hoping', 'fourth', 'X-Men', 'Gambit', 'and/or', 'Longshot', 'are', 'it.Helpful', 'hint', 'stick', 'closing', 'credits', 'more', 'movie']",N/A

The basic story premise is that the government has found a way to eliminate in other words ""cure"" the mutant X gene thus eliminating mutants from society by turning them into regular human beings. Although humans and mutants have now learned to coexist this newly propagated cure is reason enough for Magneto (Ian McKellen) to mount an offensive and wage a war on humans in ""a fury the world has never seen..""Rattner has improved on the pacing which in my opinion was but the only fault of X2 keeping a steady balance between character exposition, action and humor. The production quality such as special effects, camera and sound mix is first rate; aside from the established cast Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin there are some new mutant entries Kelsey Grammar as ""The Beast"" aka secretary for mutant affairs, Vinnie Jones as ""The Juggernaut"" and Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde, a young girl who can walk through walls and serves as Rogue's rival love interest for Bobby.The best acting, however, belongs to Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and most of all to Sir Ian McKellen (Magneto). McKellen who happened to be the best part of this year's abysmal DaVinci Code is quite the scene stealer in X3 portraying a smart, calm yet lethal villain, who happens to come across quite sympathetic.In a nutshell: finally a nice, solid good summer blockbuster - good entertainment!

Scenes that should provoke some emotion end up being laughable, like the ""Angel"" flying away from the skyscraper and his manipulative father. Let alone their timely ""reconciliation""... Others, that should be beautiful, like Phoenix's love scene with Pyro, leave us as cold as the icy weather Storm creates.This film is not alone in its mediocrity: it's a proven product, so I guess studios will hammer on with this ""genre"" of films acted by computers and with enough ""romance"" and ""emotion"" to make any intelligent teen throw up.There are a couple of new characters, and also a few sudden deaths, but even those elicit less empathy than a diapers commercial. The ""rebellion"" as well as the ""mutants who want to be cured"" look like people on welfare more than a mighty army ready to ""take the world"".Famke is nice, and red hair suits her. And the way she walks! Pity she's given no decent lines nor character development. Rebecca Romijn is a classic beauty, so much it can withstand all this... blue :)!Like most US blockbusters, packs a few jokes, two of them being actually good (the rest are sad). As any good franchise, the ""open endings"" leave room for about a dozen more episodes and related products.Stay until the credits are gone if you want to use your brain a bit (it'll be bored by 1 hour + of  inactivity :) ).This is a film for dumb teenagers, so it's tirelessly marketed for them. The fact that this film grossed more than 200 million makes me have doubts about the humanity's future. And it having been shown at Cannes...I suppose any French critic armed with psychoanalysis can tear it apart in less time than you can eat one popcorn.I agree with ""M. Miller"" from Amazon that it's intriguing that Jean/Phoenix basically doesn't speak, given her central role.And with Andrew ""Radaar"": there are just way too many characters. Using his words, but with my own ideas: This film is a franchise in instalments.The best review I read is, by far, ""stu157 from United Kingdom"" in IMDB. Selections: ""The previous films had intelligence and emotion, compared to explosions and annoyances.""""The final battle is also inexplicable, with both sides not really sure what they should be doing"". ""what is (the problem)? The script.

This actually was my favorite of the three.For those who have not read my other reviews on the X-Men movies, the theme of the series is fighting prejudice.  The bad guy mutants are ready to wage war with the humans who persecute them.  The good guy mutants try to live peaceably with humans and even protect them from the bad guys.  This one reverses the plot from the original movie:  instead of mutants trying to change humans into mutants, there is a new drug humans devised to change mutants into humans.This movie has a parallel theme, which is the matter of choice.  As a minister, I'm familiar with the debate over predestination and free will.  In the story, there are humans who think mutants need to be cured, mutants who oppose this cure, and mutants who believe they don't need to be cured but will allow each individual to make up their mind of whether they want to change.One reason I like this movie is it introduces two of my favorite X-Men comic characters that were so far absent:  The Beast, one of the original X-Men (played superbly by Kelsey Grammer), and the Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), who is a mutant in the movie though not in the comics.  Another original X-Man that makes his movie debut is the Angel.I found the ending of the first movie to be effectively symbolic, and there is an allusion to it in the ending of this movie.  I enjoyed several of the little tangent stories.  I didn't mind the fact that Storm got more attention than usual (and the Wolverine always dominated the stories), but many of the other characters have adequate development.

The President of the USA, with his Secretary to Mutant Affairs who is not even informed, let alone associated, to the President's decisions on such a matter, has paid for the invention or devising of a special genetic vaccine to ""cure"" the mutants of their mutant-ness. This gives the opportunity to the bad mutants to gather some groups and even crowds and to start some terrorist action against this cure in the name that mutant-ness is not a disease. The final battle in order to destroy the research center that devised the ""cure"" and the scientist who is behind the discovery is spectacular with a bridge rotated in order to tie up San Francisco to Alcatraz by way of the Golden Gate Bridge. This time the battle will bring the bad mutants down once and for all. The leader of them, a certain Magneto, will be injected four doses of the ""cure"", the winged son of the President of the USA will save the scientist, and Wolverine, the man with metal bones and claws on his hands will get rid of the too famous Jean who had gone wild and evil after her resurrection from the water catastrophe in the previous film. Then peace and safety are finally assured and men and mutants can live happily together thereafter and have many children. Such films are definitely naive as for the meaning but they are saved by the special effects and are entertaining after all. We could of course compare this trilogy with the Aliens first three films, or with the Terminator trilogy, or the two Star Wars trilogies. We would always find somewhere the belief that the future is not so grim as it may look and that good will always get over evil. Then the differences are in the surviving or winning models. From the Genesis or Ragnarok model of Terminator, to the bi-partisan peace of this X-Men trilogy, to the never ending resurrection of the Aliens in the Aliens series, to the democratic victory of the two Star Wars trilogies, we can write volumes on the persistence and return of such ideological, supposedly religious or philosophical models, but the best novel ever written on that subject remains Stephen King's The Stand.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",4,The future is rosy even if the UN Ambassador is blue,1224547200,"10 21, 2008",2008,2353,"['third', 'act', 'tragedy', 'drama', 'time', 'bringing', 'fight', 'mutant', 'community', 'President', 'USA', 'Secretary', 'Mutant', 'Affairs', 'who', 'not', 'even', 'informed', 'let', 'alone', 'associated', 'President', 'decisions', 'matter', 'paid', 'invention', 'devising', 'special', 'genetic', 'vaccine', 'cure', 'mutants', 'mutant-ness', 'opportunity', 'bad', 'mutants', 'gather', 'groups', 'even', 'crowds', 'start', 'terrorist', 'action', 'cure', 'name', 'mutant-ness', 'not', 'disease', 'final', 'battle', 'order', 'destroy', 'research', 'center', 'devised', 'cure', 'scientist', 'who', 'discovery', 'spectacular', 'bridge', 'rotated', 'order', 'tie', 'up', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Alcatraz', 'way', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', 'time', 'battle', 'will', 'bring', 'bad', 'mutants', 'down', 'once', 'leader', 'certain', 'Magneto', 'will', 'be', 'injected', 'four', 'doses', 'cure', 'winged', 'son', 'President', 'USA', 'will', 'save', 'scientist', 'Wolverine', 'man', 'metal', 'bones', 'claws', 'hands', 'will', 'get', 'rid', 'too', 'famous', 'Jean', 'who', 'had', 'gone', 'wild', 'evil', 'resurrection', 'water', 'catastrophe', 'previous', 'film', 'Then', 'peace', 'safety', 'are', 'finally', 'assured', 'men', 'mutants', 'can', 'live', 'happily', 'together', 'thereafter', 'have', 'many', 'children', 'Such', 'films', 'are', 'definitely', 'naive', 'meaning', 'are', 'saved', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'entertaining', 'could', 'course', 'compare', 'trilogy', 'Aliens', 'first', 'three', 'films', 'Terminator', 'trilogy', 'two', 'Star', 'Wars', 'trilogies', 'would', 'always', 'find', 'somewhere', 'belief', 'future', 'not', 'so', 'grim', 'may', 'look', 'good', 'will', 'always', 'get', 'evil', 'Then', 'differences', 'are', 'surviving', 'winning', 'models', 'Genesis', 'Ragnarok', 'model', 'Terminator', 'bi-partisan', 'peace', 'X-Men', 'trilogy', 'never', 'ending', 'resurrection', 'Aliens', 'Aliens', 'series', 'democratic', 'victory', 'two', 'Star', 'Wars', 'trilogies', 'can', 'write', 'volumes', 'persistence', 'return', 'such', 'ideological', 'supposedly', 'religious', 'philosophical', 'models', 'best', 'novel', 'ever', 'written', 'subject', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Stand.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",N/A

Although Cyclops is only ""presumed"" dead since they didn't find a body, even though he's hardly had any airtime in the last movie either accept for being brainwashed or wussying on about Jean being ""presumedly"" dead. As for Prof. X's bit at the end, since his body was destroyed, he must've downloaded his consciousness into a comatose body in the facility where Dr. MacTaggert was working at. Jean could of course probably come back too since she's been resurrected more times than Jason, Freddy Kreuger, and Jesus combined!They did a pretty good deal with the extended mutant cast. Although they didn't explain how Beast was in human form in X2, and now he's fully-furry. Callisto got way too many powers from her comic counterpart. Psylocke was dumbed down alot as far as her powers too. Nice to see Multiple Man. Shadowcat finally gets some decent airtime, although it would've been cool to see Jubilee too. Angel was fair, even if he is one of the more boring X-Men. And Juggernaut just rocked! Don't care if he's not really a mutant, that was just gold! It would've been nice if they bothered saying whether Toad or Sabertooth were still alive or not from the first flick, or where the hell Nightcrawler was.For the original cast, they brought this whole darker side to Prof. X that actually made Magneto's side look like the fair one. Magneto was a cold prick though after what happened to Mystique(""That's my slave name!""), and him being turned human would've been an act worse than death for him, which might've only been temporary on high-class mutants. Iceman finally ices up, although I don't remember his clothes being visible before when he did that. Rouge pretty much wussed out at the last minute, which I don't know why she's at the Xavier Institute since she's human now. Cyclops just was a whiney bitch as usual. They just couldn't write anything interesting for him after the first movie. Jean's version of the Phoenix's is more like something out of a Stephen King novel. I half-expected to see the 666 sign on her forehead. And...Mystique's a brunette? Say what?Even though alot of reports had come in claiming that this is the last X-flick, they left a big enough room for more.

1012394,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B000HCO83G,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[29, 54]","I had this horrible awful dream the other night that someone took the two of the greatest X-Men storylines of all time and reduced it to a terrifyingly bad encapsuliation, written and performed about as ineptly as anyone could ever imagine. Unfortunately this dream turned out to be real. And the more I thought about this film, the more upset I became. This is just an awful AWFUL film that, for some inexplicable reason, people continue to defend by saying ""At least it was entertaining!"". This jerkwad excuse does NOT work. There is very little fun and almost nothing funny about this film. It works hard to hold your interest but fails miserably. I do not actually blame Brett Ratner so much for this failure as much as I do the writers, Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn. They have little-to-no respect for the source materiel and even less for the characters. What's even worse is the performances in this film. Halle Berry couldn't be more wooden if she had roots firmly planted in the ground. Hugh Jackman... when did Wolverine become such a wuss-bag? When have we EVER seen Logan shed a tear in the comic? If you've found it, you're more of a fan than I. Hugh Jackman seems to want to turn Logan into the Melancholy Dane. And it works not one bit. The only outstanding performer in this film really is Sir Ian. McKellen is one of the greatest actors to have ever lived and he continues his great work here. Kelsey Grammer as Henry ""Beast"" McCoy also is quite good, because his performance is one done with great affection for the character. I don't know if the direction that they decided to go with for the creation of The Phoenix is interesting or absurd. It does fit in with more of the ""real world"" stuff that they're looking to do (having Phoenix be a repressed dominant personality rather than a cosmic lifeforce is definitely more realistic, but this is a COMIC BOOK ADAPTATION...). Anna Paquin, who has been my least favorite character of the entire series, not that I disliked Rogue, but Paquin ALWAYS seems to be on the verge of tears. Rogue was someone in the comics, who, at times, revelled in her power, whereas Paquin's Rogue is sooooo incredibly saddened by her abilities (understandably, but COME ON... let her have some FUN once in a great while) that we're meant to empathize with her ultimate decision, which is also something that really bothered me. Most people in this film are just wasted... none more so than James Marsden aka Cyclops. His character is given the WORST of the fates in store for the mutant heroes, and no respect is given to him other that a passing moment at the end. That was the worst part for me because Cyclops was always my favorite X-Man, and his treatment in all of the films (worst of all this film) is upsetting to say the least. For the better part of the first decade that X-MEN was in print, the main focus of the group was Cyclops, even though they did have the foresight to have the team have an actual TEAM dynamic, as opposed to this film where it seems it's Wolverine vs. the world. It ranks amongst BATMAN AND ROBIN, ELEKTRA, and LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN as one of the worst comic book films ever made, and I recommend to read the comics and skip this film entirely.",1,Someone PLEASE wake me up from this nightmare.,1155859200,"08 18, 2006",2006,3236,"['had', 'horrible', 'awful', 'dream', 'other', 'night', 'someone', 'took', 'two', 'greatest', 'X-Men', 'storylines', 'time', 'reduced', 'terrifyingly', 'bad', 'encapsuliation', 'written', 'performed', 'as', 'ineptly', 'anyone', 'could', 'ever', 'imagine', 'Unfortunately', 'dream', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'real', 'more', 'thought', 'film', 'more', 'upset', 'became', 'just', 'awful', 'AWFUL', 'film', 'inexplicable', 'reason', 'people', 'continue', 'defend', 'saying', 'least', 'was', 'entertaining', 'jerkwad', 'excuse', 'NOT', 'work', 'very', 'little', 'fun', 'almost', 'nothing', 'funny', 'film', 'hard', 'hold', 'interest', 'miserably', 'do', 'not', 'actually', 'blame', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'so', 'much', 'failure', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'writers', 'Simon', 'Kinberg', 'Zak', 'Penn', 'have', 'little-to-no', 'respect', 'source', 'materiel', 'even', 'less', 'characters', 'What', 'even', 'worse', 'performances', 'film', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'wooden', 'had', 'roots', 'firmly', 'planted', 'ground', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'when', 'did', 'Wolverine', 'become', 'such', 'wuss-bag', 'When', 'have', 'EVER', 'seen', 'Logan', 'shed', 'tear', 'comic', ""'ve"", 'found', ""'re"", 'more', 'fan', 'I.', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'want', 'turn', 'Logan', 'Melancholy', 'Dane', 'not', 'one', 'bit', 'only', 'outstanding', 'performer', 'film', 'really', 'Sir', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'have', 'ever', 'lived', 'great', 'work', 'here', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'Henry', 'Beast', 'McCoy', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'performance', 'one', 'done', 'great', 'affection', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'direction', 'decided', 'go', 'creation', 'Phoenix', 'interesting', 'absurd', 'fit', 'more', 'real', 'world', 'stuff', ""'re"", 'looking', 'do', 'having', 'Phoenix', 'be', 'repressed', 'dominant', 'personality', 'rather', 'cosmic', 'lifeforce', 'definitely', 'more', 'realistic', 'COMIC', 'BOOK', 'ADAPTATION', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'who', 'been', 'least', 'favorite', 'character', 'entire', 'series', 'not', 'disliked', 'Rogue', 'Paquin', 'ALWAYS', 'be', 'verge', 'tears', 'Rogue', 'was', 'someone', 'comics', 'who', 'times', 'revelled', 'power', 'Paquin', 'Rogue', 'sooooo', 'incredibly', 'saddened', 'abilities', 'understandably', 'COME', 'ON', 'let', 'have', 'FUN', 'once', 'great', 'while', ""'re"", 'meant', 'empathize', 'ultimate', 'decision', 'also', 'something', 'really', 'bothered', 'Most', 'people', 'film', 'are', 'just', 'wasted', 'none', 'more', 'so', 'James', 'Marsden', 'aka', 'Cyclops', 'character', 'given', 'WORST', 'fates', 'store', 'mutant', 'heroes', 'respect', 'given', 'other', 'passing', 'moment', 'end', 'was', 'worst', 'part', 'Cyclops', 'was', 'always', 'favorite', 'X-Man', 'treatment', 'films', 'worst', 'film', 'upsetting', 'say', 'least', 'better', 'part', 'first', 'decade', 'X-MEN', 'was', 'print', 'main', 'focus', 'group', 'was', 'Cyclops', 'even', 'did', 'have', 'foresight', 'have', 'team', 'have', 'actual', 'TEAM', 'dynamic', 'opposed', 'film', 'where', 'Wolverine', 'world', 'amongst', 'BATMAN', 'AND', 'ROBIN', 'ELEKTRA', 'LEAGUE', 'OF', 'EXTRAORDINARY', 'GENTLEMEN', 'one', 'worst', 'comic', 'book', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'recommend', 'read', 'comics', 'skip', 'film', 'entirely']",N/A
1012395,A3UV7L5ND3EH8T,B000HCO83G,"Janet Boyer ""Snowland Deck and Coffee Tarot C...","[10, 14]","My husband and I love the first two installments of X-Men. We were in a Stuff Mart over the weekend, and I suggested buying X-Men 3. My husband asked ""Are you *sure*?"" I replied ""Well, we loved the first two installments. With Jean Grey returing as The Phoenix, it should be great!""We watched it last night and were stunned. We were both silent--in shock--at the end of the movie.SPOILER ALERT: Phoenix--resurrected Jean Grey--ends up killing Cyclops during a romantic tryst. You see, we weren't told something important in the first two installments: Xavier had to ""split"" Jean into two personalities to protect her from her own gifts. The purely instinctual, uncontrolled, subconscious part of her was ""The Phoenix"". The conscious, controlled, intellectual part was the Jean we knew from the first two movies.If that isn't bad, she ends up disintegrating Xavier. Yes, the beloved Doctor and leader of the School for Gifted Youngsters goes out with a whimper.Magneto takes this uncontrollable creature under his wings (?!). She mostly stands by looking blank (I think she was supposed to look menacing) until the final confrontation. After some of the mutants are neutralized with ""the cure"" (a serum derived from a mutant that reverses mutations) or destroyed--THEN Phoenix suddenly goes into action, disintegrating people and objects.Wolverine says he's the only one that can stop her, because of his regenerative skills. Jean comes to her senses for a few seconds, and begs Wolverine to save her. Of course, he has to kill her to do so.Storm--a lackluster Hallie Barry--ends up taking over the school and delivering a ho-hum eulogy.There's so much wrong with this movie that I don't know where to start. I'll just mention a few:1. Brett Ratner stinks as a director2. Special effects, no matter how cool, are never a substitute for a strong plot and strong dialogue (unless you're just a mindless consumer of action flicks)3. Magneto, played by Ian McKellan, wears his helmet almost the entire second half of the movie. If you recall, he wore this helmet to stop the thoughts of Xavier from infiltrating and influencing his mind. Why, then, did Magneto continue to wear his helmet after Xavier was annihilated?4. If Xavier was going to die, he deserved a better send off than having his protege having a cosmic tantrum and destroying him5. Why is Logan/Wolverine smiling up at the sky, school campus awash in sunshine and colorful flowers, when he's lost his father figure and had to kill the woman he loves--in effect losing her TWICE?6. Bobby (Ice Boy) begins to get cozy with the Girl Who Can Walk Through Walls. There is little interaction between he and Rogue (poor Anna Paquin hardly gets any air time!)--and Rogue knows Bobby is cozy with the other chick. Yet, she takes the cure to rid her of her mutant powers so she can touch/kiss Bobby? Maybe--but GEEZ. Weren't enough mutants already killed or neutralized?!So we have Mystique neutralized (she's a mere human), as is Magneto and Rogue. Xavier is dead, as is Jean Grey and Cyclops. Storm is in charge of the school, Wolverine is hunky dory with the way everything has turned out, and the mutants and humans are now united--living happily ever after.For crying out loud!!The only good thing about this movie was the special effects and some cool mutants like ""Tin Man"" (can't remember his real name), the blue fur guy, Juggernaut (very cool!), Angel Boy (also cool) and a kid who sprouts spikes.However, that's not enough to save this movie. We were so disgusted that I'm going to list this movie on Amazon for sale right after I write this review. (We didn't even want to explore the extras or alternative endings!)What a waste of EXCELLENT acting talent. (That is, Ian McKellan, Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, and Anna Paquin.)Whoever agreed to hand this debacle over to Brett Ratner should be excommunicated from Hollywood--as should Ratner himself and whoever wrote this lacklaster script.What a way to sink an incredible, exciting movie franchise!",2,Disappointing,1160352000,"10 9, 2006",2006,4015,"['husband', 'love', 'first', 'two', 'installments', 'X-Men', 'were', 'Stuff', 'Mart', 'weekend', 'suggested', 'buying', 'X-Men', '3', 'husband', 'asked', 'Are', '*sure*', 'replied', 'Well', 'loved', 'first', 'two', 'installments', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'returing', 'Phoenix', 'should', 'be', 'great', 'watched', 'last', 'night', 'were', 'stunned', 'were', 'silent', 'shock', 'end', 'movie.SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'Phoenix', 'resurrected', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'up', 'killing', 'Cyclops', 'romantic', 'tryst', 'see', 'were', ""n't"", 'told', 'something', 'important', 'first', 'two', 'installments', 'Xavier', 'had', 'split', 'Jean', 'two', 'personalities', 'protect', 'own', 'gifts', 'purely', 'instinctual', 'uncontrolled', 'subconscious', 'part', 'was', 'Phoenix', 'conscious', 'controlled', 'intellectual', 'part', 'was', 'Jean', 'knew', 'first', 'two', 'movies.If', ""n't"", 'bad', 'up', 'disintegrating', 'Xavier', 'Yes', 'beloved', 'Doctor', 'leader', 'School', 'Gifted', 'Youngsters', 'out', 'whimper.Magneto', 'uncontrollable', 'creature', 'wings', 'mostly', 'looking', 'blank', 'think', 'was', 'supposed', 'look', 'menacing', 'final', 'confrontation', 'mutants', 'are', 'neutralized', 'cure', 'serum', 'derived', 'mutant', 'mutations', 'destroyed', 'THEN', 'Phoenix', 'suddenly', 'action', 'disintegrating', 'people', 'objects.Wolverine', 'only', 'one', 'can', 'stop', 'regenerative', 'skills', 'Jean', 'senses', 'few', 'seconds', 'Wolverine', 'save', 'course', 'kill', 'do', 'so.Storm', 'lackluster', 'Hallie', 'Barry', 'up', 'taking', 'school', 'delivering', 'ho-hum', 'eulogy.There', 'so', 'much', 'wrong', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'start', ""'ll"", 'just', 'mention', 'few:1', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'director2', 'Special', 'effects', 'matter', 'how', 'cool', 'are', 'never', 'substitute', 'strong', 'plot', 'strong', 'dialogue', ""'re"", 'just', 'mindless', 'consumer', 'action', 'flicks', '3', 'Magneto', 'played', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'helmet', 'almost', 'entire', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'recall', 'wore', 'helmet', 'stop', 'thoughts', 'Xavier', 'infiltrating', 'influencing', 'mind', 'Why', 'then', 'did', 'Magneto', 'continue', 'wear', 'helmet', 'Xavier', 'was', 'annihilated', '4', 'Xavier', 'was', 'going', 'die', 'deserved', 'better', 'send', 'having', 'protege', 'having', 'cosmic', 'tantrum', 'destroying', 'him5', 'Why', 'Logan/Wolverine', 'smiling', 'up', 'sky', 'school', 'campus', 'awash', 'sunshine', 'colorful', 'flowers', 'when', 'lost', 'father', 'figure', 'had', 'kill', 'woman', 'effect', 'losing', 'TWICE', '6', 'Bobby', 'Ice', 'Boy', 'get', 'cozy', 'Girl', 'Who', 'Can', 'Walk', 'Walls', 'little', 'interaction', 'Rogue', 'poor', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'hardly', 'air', 'time', 'Rogue', 'Bobby', 'cozy', 'other', 'chick', 'cure', 'rid', 'mutant', 'powers', 'can', 'touch/kiss', 'Bobby', 'Maybe', 'GEEZ', 'Were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'mutants', 'already', 'killed', 'neutralized', 'have', 'Mystique', 'neutralized', 'mere', 'human', 'Magneto', 'Rogue', 'Xavier', 'dead', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'Cyclops', 'Storm', 'charge', 'school', 'Wolverine', 'hunky', 'dory', 'way', 'everything', 'turned', 'out', 'mutants', 'humans', 'are', 'now', 'united', 'living', 'happily', 'ever', 'after.For', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'was', 'special', 'effects', 'cool', 'mutants', 'Tin', 'Man', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'real', 'name', 'blue', 'fur', 'guy', 'Juggernaut', 'very', 'cool', 'Angel', 'Boy', 'also', 'cool', 'kid', 'who', 'spikes.However', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'movie', 'were', 'so', 'disgusted', ""'m"", 'going', 'list', 'movie', 'Amazon', 'sale', 'right', 'write', 'review', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'explore', 'extras', 'alternative', 'endings', 'What', 'waste', 'EXCELLENT', 'acting', 'talent', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'agreed', 'hand', 'debacle', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'should', 'be', 'excommunicated', 'Hollywood', 'should', 'Ratner', 'whoever', 'wrote', 'lacklaster', 'script.What', 'way', 'sink', 'incredible', 'exciting', 'movie', 'franchise']",N/A

1012397,A2ZWTA18X37QOZ,B000HCO83G,"Jason Oey ""UltramarineX""","[2, 4]","***WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS***First off, despite my above warning, I will truly try my best to keep this review as spoiler free as possible, however I may not be entirely successful.  Now, I've just come back from seeing X-Men: The Last Stand with a few of my friends.  Coming out of the theatre, my reactions to the movie were decidedly mixed.  Overall, I thought it was good action movie with some spectacular special effects, and great acting by everyone involved.  On the other hand, I could not help but feel cheated (and in a couple of cases pissed off) at what the writers did to some of the characters.  To casual movie goers, what happened to some of the characters in the movie may not have that much impact.  But, as someone who grew up with the X-men from a young age, I couldn't help but feel a little angry.X-Men: The Last Stand's story revolves around the discovery of a cure for the mutant condition, which can supposedly turn a mutant into a normal human permanently.  Magneto sees this as a threat to himself, and the entire mutant race.  He personally takes it upon himself to unite all mutants under a common ""Brotherhood"" and destroy this cure.  Also, Jean Grey is resurrected as the all powerful Phoenix.  However, with her new found powers comes a near uncontrollable rage, and Magneto attempts to use Jean for his purposes.  The X-Men have to band together to stop Magneto before he starts a war that can tear apart the world.As usual, almost all the actors and actresses turn in another solid performance for this movies.  Hugh Jackman gives a solid and convincing performance as Wolverine.  Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen also deserve high marks for their portrayal as Professor Xavier and Magneto respectively.  I also enjoyed Kelsey Grammer's turn as the intelligent and ferocious Beast.  Acting has never been my primary concern with action movies, but with the X-Men movies, good acting is one of the movies' high points.Of course, most people don't go to an X-Men movie to see Oscar worthy performances.  They come for hard-hitting action and cool special effects, which The Last Stand definitely delivers on.  Arguably the most impressive sequence in the whole movie is when Magneto uses his powers to separate a section of the Golden Gate Bridge to create a walkway to Alcatraz.  A lot of work must have gone into that sequence, because it looked absolutely fantastic.  The final fight scene between the X-Men and Magneto's Brotherhood was also spectacular.  Seeing the powers of so many mutants being used in one place was very satisfying.  On a related note, I was surprised at what good a fighter the Beast was in this movie.  There was no indication to his fighting ability throughout most of the movie, but seeing him let loose towards the end was great.However, the fact that we see so many mutants fighting each other also highlights one of the movie's weaknesses...that being there are TOO many mutants to keep track of.  For example, even though the character of Angel is featured prominently in the movie trailers, his appearances in The Last Stand are fairly brief and infrequent.  At times, it feels like the plotlines of too many characters are being crammed into the movie, which is especially apparent considering this movie is only 104 minutes long.  As such, we do not delve as deeply as we could into the characters, which is a shame considering how much history and depth most of them have.Now you also might be wondering, what is it about what happened to some of the characters that could make me a little irate.  Well, for that, I'm going to have to put on my X-Men nerd cap on...and go off on a little rant, so please bear with me.  I could talk for while about what happened to several of the characters in the movie, but for the interests of time, I'll just focus on one character in particular...Cyclops.  (Again, I'll try to keep the spoilers down, but if you don't want to know anything about what happened to any of the characters, please skip to the last paragraph)  Personally, Cyclops is my favourite character in the entire X-Men universe.  In the comics (and even the Fox cartoon show), he is portrayed as a strong and dedicated leader, who is willing to sacrifice himself for the good of the team.  I have always felt that Cyclops was underused in the first two X-men movies, but this is especially true in The Last Stand.  With the rise of Jean Grey's Phoenix powers, here was an opportunity to finally utilize Cyclops as a character, considering the relationship between the two.  This does not happen.  Instead, Cyclops exits the scene very early in the movie.  What was particularly jarring was how abrupt and unfitting his exit from The Last Stand was.  Now, I know that Cyclops' character isn't everyone's cup of tea, but everyone I've talked to agrees that his character, as well as other characters, were treated pretty poorly in the movie.There have been whispers and rumours flying around that, other than the Wolverine movie, there could be fourth X-Men movie.  As much as it really hurts me to say this, I hope these rumours are untrue.  You'll understand what I mean when you go see the movie, because what happens in it does not lend itself to another X-Men sequel.  In the end, I still liked X-Men: The Last Stand and I still recommend this movie, especially to fans of the series.  It has good acting, and even better action sequences.  However, I will agree with many reviewers that The Last Stand is definitely the weakest in the trilogy.I give X-Men: The Last Stand a 7.5/10.",3,"This third X-men movie was good, but the first two

Now, I'm not saying thats a bad thing, but I must say I was a little spoiled by the first two, specifically the last half hour of X-men 2, that was incredible film-making. We get alot of new characters, but not alot of background info on them, no real inter-action by any of them, and thats a shame, some of them could have been real cool to expand on. One reviewer said there was to much Halle Berry, um, no such thing my friend, she is still drop-dead gorgeous and one of the better actors in this trilogy. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is still cool as ever, and Magneto and Xavier are still a blast to watch.Now, the best part....As you may recall we lost Jean Grey at the end of 2, but good news, she's back, BIG TIME!!!! Problem is, she is sooooo powerfull she can't separate good from evil, and the battle scenes she has at the end are simply fantastic, if they decide to do a fourth, it would be wise to find a way to bring her back, definitely the coolest of all the X-men. Also, as mentioned earlier, there are tons of special effects, and most of them work, expertly shot with exceptional lighting really brings you head-on into the action, and Ratner uses it too perfection.

The effects are pretty-well done -- bridges coming off their moorings, guys shooting lasers from their eyeballs, people disintegrating or running through walls, etc.The basic story is this: a ""cure"" has been found for the mutations that gave rise to the X-Men. Evil villain Magneto (Ian McKellen) is trying to destroy the cure and raise a mutant army to do goodness knows what. Good guy Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) doesn't want the cure destroyed, for equally unclear reasons. The ensuing face-off is completely confusing and pointless, although very fun to watch. Lots of people, cars and houses getting levitated with mind control; lots of flaming, flying cars and lots of general mayhem. In the midst of this, characters are still trying to come to terms with their ""talents"" and wondering whether to take the cure and become normal. Scattered love interests add fiery arcs to this celestial fireball of a movie.""X Men III"" is great if you just want to have a good time and not think too much about plot consistency and plausibility -- like why superheros need to walk ""en masse"" to the their targets (rather than fly teleport or whatever) or why the government doesn't just ""cure"" all the bad guys rather than transport them overland in vulnerable trucks, etc.But the mutants are fun -- one guy has porcupine quills, another shoots darts from his hands -- and Juggernaut (my fave) -- rolls through just about anything.

The acting and special effects were great, and the story had a lot of potential, but the movie just wasn't put together in a gripping, exciting way.The superhero characters I have enjoyed getting to know through X-Men 1 and 2 are still there, but instead of doing cool stuff, they just strut around, serving the script. I feel their passion, but not their motivation.At the end of a huge tragic scene, some of the characters start crying. When this happened, I felt suddenly catapulted out of the mood of the movie; I was just watching the actors cry, and I felt nothing, because the movie had done such a terrible job of telling the story during that scene.One of the things I like about X-Men 1 and 2 was that the movies and characters are so strongly grounded in reality. X-Men 3 is closer to its comic-book origins, and suffers because of it. The comic-book X-Men have fantastical histories; almost all of them have died and/or lost their mutant powers multiple times. For me, the strength of the first two movies is being able to identify with the characters, even while being awed by their powers.

Of course, it had a lot to live up to, of course, with the previous two films high standard. The film opens well, with strangely disturbing versions of Xavier and Magneto visiting a young Jean. It also goes straight into to the action, the two main plots of the story soon becoming apparent. Both however, come second place to special effects in this film.At just over 1 and 30 minutes, it would be almost impossible to cram a finale worthy of the trilogy without missing out some things. I just don't see why it had to be the emotion. With the cure side of the story, it seems we never get an insight into the characters worries and feelings towards it. If it had been 2 and a half hour, it would have been able to develop all of the characters, and the back stories would have been more relevant to certain characters.  The phoenix part is also extremely disappointing, we aren't ever told why Phoenix does what she does and who is in control. You can only go so far as to blame Brett Ratner, he does a good job with the battle scenes but always seems to want to rush anything involving a character's emotion. I can imagine him on set hurrying along the actors as they try to get into character for the harrowing scenes. So if newcomer Ratner isn't the problem, what is?As for the script goes. It's as if the writers truly want this to be the last film, killing off characters early to make way for new ones. Rogue is put on the back seat, even though the central theme of the cure should have her at the forefront. The final battle is also inexplicable, with both sides not really sure what they should be doing. It does allow for one of the great moments of the trilogy (Kitty and Juggernauts chase through - and I mean through - the facility). Still on the script, don't forget the corny lines (""I'm the Juggernaut, bitch!"") and terrible ending which seems to forget the events of the rest of the film. Vinnie Jones and Halle Berry are both below par in the acting stakes even thought they didn't have much to work with. I don't want this to be the last stand as I think the saga deserves better than this. The previous films had intelligence and emotion, compared to explosions and annoyances.Overall, it was worth seeing on the big screen, and I'm glad that I saw it. It is an ""O-Kay"" film. But again, you'll be a little disappointed as an X-Men fan. Maybe X4 will prosper without many of the main characters, well, one can only hope.If you do choose to watch this make sure you stay after the credits for the final scene.

We start the movie with Charles and Eric going to Jeans house to bring her to the school. We then skip to the future and it seems that the X-MEN are training. Awesome indeed. Scott seems to be a depressive state and is also getting messages from Jean. He leaves to go to the lake where she died. We also find out that a cure has been produced. Magneto has found out and is furious. Cyclops gets to the lake and Jean is still contacting him. In a furious rage he blasts into the lake and wakes Jean up. He seems egstatic but well -------. Back at the mansion Hank informs them of the cure and in storms word ""Theres nothing to cure. Nothings wrong with us."" Xavier feels that something is wrong and tells Storm and Wolverine to get to the Lake. They find Jean and get her back to the mansion. Then we learn what the truth is. To protect Jean from getting out of control Xavier needed to put psychic blocks on her. Unfortunately she has broken free of them and he needs to put them back up. Before he can do this she gets away. I think this is where I will stop. The movie gives us a good character developement with all the mutants that were there before. There really is no sense in bringing more mutants into the equation and getting us confused. No matter what people say. I think seeing the mnutants that were in the movie was fine.

Still, he's a lot more careless than Bryan Singer. He goes for a no one is safe approach and kills off some main characters. He also wanted to introduce new mutants, which is why he killed off some people and why Night Crawler is no where to be seen. Kelsey Grammer is at least a good addition to the cast as Beast and same with Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde. Vinnie Jones isn't a bad Juddernaught as well. He's the best new villain, but all the other villains that Ratner introduced though are undeveloped and just wear leather and look like porn stars lol. So half of them I didn't even know if they were from the comics or not since we don't even get their names.While there's no going back with how bad it is with what they did with Cyclops. James Marsden was punished for choosing to be in Superman Returns but they all punished fans as well. While Famke Janssen who was excellent in X-2 is just wasted here with a blank stare and barely any lines as Dark Phoenix. Halle Berry who always demanded that Storm had more to do since...she's an Oscar winner got her wish though. Cyclops gets pushed back as leader just so we get more of her. Meanwhile someone needs to crush her ego by reminding her that she was in CatWoman. She was never even right for the part of Storm. It's Jenssen who actually deserved more to do as Jean Grey.As a last film the movie doesn't work as well since it hints to things to come in the credits. Which is why it bugs me when some fans say, hey there's still origin movies coming out. I just want to know what happens next. We already have a good idea to what happened with Wolverine before the X-men movies. Same with Magneto who also has an origin movie coming out. I'm not sure how they could clean up the mess that Ratner made with this film with a part 4 but I'd still like to Singer come back and try.

Kitty Pryde was wasted. This movie was terrible... and I am a huge comics nerd and I get why people would defend it.

The first two were directed by Bryan Singer and what he did with the X-men franchise I thought was great. The stories were great, the acting was great, the visuals were good for the time period. Then comes X-Men: The Last Stand and the movie is just a complete piece of crap. It started when Bryan Singer left the project (I assume it had something to do with him deciding to do Superman Returns and Fox did not like that) and was replaced by Brett Ratner (Hollywood's hack director). I give the movie 2 stars because the entire cast came back to reprise their roles and they did what they could to save this steaming pile of manure. The plot was bad, they decided to start killing off main characters during the movie (Cyclops is literally in it for 5 mins), and the ending was awful. It really left no room for an X-Men 4 because no one would want to see it after so many characters had been killed off. The movie left such a bad taste in peoples mouths that when X-Men: First Class (a prequel to the entire trilogy) came out not everyone flocked to see it (X-men Origins: Wolverine didn't help either).

1012429,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B000HCO83G,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[2, 3]","In the last decade one genre has returned from almost certain death to become one of Hollywood's most lucrative sources of income. That genre is that of the superhero, or comic book genre as it is most commonly referred to as. Several franchises have been successfully established within this revived genre, some standouts would be the `Spider-Man' movies, `Batman' reboot and the `Blade' trilogy. In the midst of all of those, one franchise has stood out from all the others by taking the focus of the comic book film away from being only on a few key characters and onto an entire team of heroes. This set of movies is none other than the `X-Men' franchise.After two highly successful trips to the box office with ""X-Men"" and ""X2: X-Men United"", both with Bryan Singer at the helm, the third film ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" would feature a new director. For the third entry in the series, director Brett Ratner (""Red Dragon"") took over for Bryan Singer, who left the series to direct ""Superman Returns"". The decision to have Brett Ratner at the helm of such a high profile movie that was to serve as the supposed final chapter in the popular superhero trilogy, caused many a fan to become uneasy. This was caused in part by the fact that Ratner had at one point been picked by Warner Brothers to direct the newest `Superman' movie; however, before much progress could be made he dropped out of the film. So, with a new director onboard that had little to no obvious experience in dealing with elaborate visual effects (not to mention the fact that he couldn't handle one hero let alone a team), and the success of a franchise on the line, one question remained. ""Could this latest chapter in the `X-Men' series hope to succeed when it seemed that so many factors were working against it?""""X-Men: The Last Stand"" begins with the creation of a new `cure' for the mutant gene, allowing those born with powers to choose whether they wanted to remain mutants or take the cure and become normal human beings. This `cure' quickly becomes the focus for the mutant race, and serves as the potential catalyst to spark an all-out war that has been brewing between Magneto's (Sir Ian McKellan) `Brotherhood of Mutants' and Professor Charles Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) X-Men. With mutantkind divided as to which side to choose, the battle lines are quickly being drawn, and the final battle is about to begin!Screenwriter Zak Penn (""xXx: State of the Union""), taking over for departing writers Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris (who also jumped ship to work on ""Superman Returns""), chose wisely (in my opinion) to not focus on a story dealing solely with the `cure' for mutants. Granted the cure story arc was interesting and provided some very captivating moments between key characters as some felt the cure was a blessing, while others felt it was just another way for humans to oppress the mutants even further. With that being said, I don't feel that this storyline would have been able to sustain the film throughout its entire duration. With that in mind I feel confident in stating that the film greatly benefited from the intermixing of the incredibly popular Phoenix story arc from the comic books. The Phoenix plotline, just as it did in the comics, provided some very intense moments within the story, along with numerous opportunities for the characters to explore how they feel about Jean's miraculous resurrection and her newly unleashed awesome power. This proved especially true for Hugh Jackman's character Wolverine, as he now finds the woman he loves may be a threat to everything else he holds dear.Many detractors of this film felt that the movie lacked in substance, and that the film would have been better served had it focused solely on Jean Grey becoming the Phoenix. I agree that the film probably would have been even better had it dealt even more, if not solely on Jean's manifestation into the Phoenix. However I must disagree with the first sentiment about the lack of substance. This film was the final act (or at least it appears to be) in a trilogy, meaning that in some way it ties into events that occurred in the previous two films. Therefore, this film is intended more as a means of tying up any and all remaining loose ends left over from its predecessors, while at the same time expanding somewhat on what had been laid out prior to this entry. In the case of ""X-Men: The Last Stand"", the film's story was focused on exploring what happened to Jean in the closing moments of ""X2"", unleashing the war that had been brewing between the two opposing sides of the mutant race, and introducing us to the concept of a cure for mutants. If you ask me, those three aspects of the story provided plenty of substance for this film to draw from, and it did so in a satisfying way that didn't come off as overly bloated and complicated like some third film's in a trilogy have of late (for example, ""The Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"").The cast, as they have been in the previous installments, was still as great as ever; except for a couple of exceptions. Actresses Halle Berry and Anna Paquin appeared to struggle with their characters for some reason in this film. Both of their performances varied between good to being just flat and disinterested in nature. I will say that aside from her performance in ""X2"", Halle has been inconsistent with her interpretation of the X-Man known as Storm; however, by this point one would have hoped that she would have figured the character out by now. As for Anna Paquin, I don't really know what the problem was; perhaps it was her character's arc in this film and her insecurity about being a mutant becoming more apparent given the newly discovered cure. Whatever the case may be, she clearly struggled to find a groove in her surprisingly small amount of screen time, given that the character was much more involved in the previous two films, and in the end she delivered what could possibly be classified as the most uninspired performance in the film. Like I said, aside from these two, the remainder of the returning cast members continued to deliver solid performances, even when relegated to little more than a cameo appearance (I'm referring to James Marsden's character Cyclops).Joining the returning members, the film featured several newcomers to the series, such as Kelsey Grammer (Beast), Vinnie Jones (Juggernaut) and Ben Foster (Angel), all of whom fit right in, as if they'd been members of the cast since the very first movie. Now, I for one never would have picked Kelsey Grammer (TV's ""Fraiser"") to embody the X-Man known as the Beast. Sure he could handle the intellectual dialogue and would sound genuine in doing so, but I wouldn't have thought of him as being all that physical of an actor. However, there he was in some of the fight sequences right in there with the other X-Men, and holding his own without any trouble at all. It's just one more example of how some of the casting choices in Hollywood never cease to amaze me in how spot on they are, despite all appearances to the contrary. Next we have soccer player turned actor Vinnie Jones (""Gone in 60 Seconds"") offering up his portrayal of the powerhouse mutant known as Juggernaut. Juggernaut pretty much did in this film exactly what the character is known for in the comics, essentially decimate anything and everything in his path. The only major difference between the two mediums is that there was no mention ever made to the character being the half-brother to Charles Xavier. Aside from that Vinnie's performance was as good as expected for an actor playing a character that isn't known for being all that much of a thinker or having any real depth to him.Last but not least, we have actor Ben Foster as the mutant known as Warren Worthington III, a.k.a. Angel. The only thing you can say about Ben, other than the fact that he pretty much knocks every performance out of the park, is that he is a true chameleon when it comes to his appearance and presentation from role to role. In one movie he'll have long black hair and an extremely bad attitude (""Hostage""), then he'll have scraggly red hair, a plethora of piercings, and a heart of gold (""The Punisher""), or he will be a clean cut, blonde heir to a massive fortune as he is in this film. It's amazing to me to see just how diverse Ben has proven to be in various movies, and each performance is always unique from the one before it. This is one actor who I believe will go down as one of the best and most talented of his generation.The action scenes in this film are the most intense out of all the `X-Men' movies. Everything is so exciting and fast-paced that you feel like you have to see the movie more than once to fully take it all in. Going hand-in-hand with the action, the special effects work is also the best out of the franchise. Not that the visuals in the first two movies were anything to look down upon. In this film there is one sequence alone, involving the Golden Gate Bridge, that is worth the price of purchasing this movie.""X-Men: The Last Stand"" isn't a perfect movie by any means; however, it completely ties up all loose ends while still delivering to us a pulse-pounding battle that had been teased at for the last two films. Despite all the bad press this film has received among some fans, critics and so on, I personally found this installment to be just as entertaining as the first film, and a fitting end to the series.""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and sensuality.",4,The War Over Mutant Supremacy Has Begun...,1242950400,"05 22, 2009",2009,9546,"['last', 'decade', 'one',

At first I was disappointed, but considering the awful reviews for the latter film, perhaps I was lucky after all!Neither my wife nor myself (we're both post-college career people in our 20s) are at all interested in comics, but we both found this film exciting. It seems that there were two previous films in this franchise, and neither of us saw those, but that didn't prevent us from figuring out who was who, what powers they had, and so on. The only trouble I ran into was determining why Xavier and Magneto had a falling out and became enemies, after being friends. Also, it was clear that there were some romantic triangles involved in the previous two films that reach a [violent] resolution in this third installment, but not seeing how those relationships panned out still doesn't make this film a dud or anything like that.It was kind of fun during this movie to play ""spot the star,"" since there were many actors in it who achieved fame elsewhere (Star Trek, Lord of the Rings, and of all things, Frasier).There were only a couple of eyebrow-raising moments for me during the film -- and on both occasions they involved a male character calling a female character the ""B"" word in an obvious attempt at humor. Even though both male characters (a police security guard and the mutant superhero ""Juggernaut"") get their comeuppance, both moments struck me as rather unfunny, and nobody in our particular theatre laughed. When Juggernaut uses the word, he uses it against a little girl (superhero or not, she's a little girl) so it seemed kind of jarring.Other than those couple of moments, this movie is a great ride and you won't regret it!",4,"entertaining, even for people who know nothing about the comics",1149465600,"06 5, 2006",2006,1783,"['got', 'see', 'new', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'wife', 'were', 'too', 'late', 'see', 'last', 'showing', 'theatre-mate', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'first', 'was', 'disappointed', 'considering', 'awful', 'reviews', 'latter', 'film', 'perhaps', 'was', 'lucky', 'wife', ""'re"", 'post-college', 'career', 'people', '20s', 'are', 'interested', 'comics', 'found', 'film', 'exciting', 'were', 'two', 'previous', 'films', 'franchise', 'saw', 'did', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'figuring', 'out', 'who', 'was', 'who', 'what', 'had', 'so', 'only', 'trouble', 'ran', 'was', 'determining', 'why', 'Xavier', 'Magneto', 'had', 'falling', 'out', 'became', 'enemies', 'being', 'friends', 'Also', 'was', 'clear', 'were', 'romantic', 'triangles', 'involved', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'reach', '[', 'violent', ']', 'resolution', 'third', 'installment', 'not', 'seeing', 'how', 'relationships', 'panned', 'out', 'still', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'dud', 'anything', 'that.It', 'was', 'kind', 'fun', 'movie', 'play', 'spot', 'star', 'were', 'many', 'actors', 'who', 'achieved', 'fame', 'elsewhere', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'things', 'Frasier', 'were', 'only', 'couple', 'eyebrow-raising', 'moments', 'film', 'occasions', 'involved', 'male', 'character', 'calling', 'female', 'character', 'B', 'word', 'obvious', 'attempt', 'humor', 'Even', 'male', 'characters', 'police', 'security', 'guard', 'mutant', 'superhero', 'Juggernaut', 'get', 'comeuppance', 'moments', 'struck', 'rather', 'unfunny', 'nobody', 'particular', 'theatre', 'laughed', 'When', 'Juggernaut', 'word', 'little', 'girl', 'superhero', 'not', 'little', 'girl', 'seemed', 'kind', 'jarring.Other', 'couple', 'moments', 'movie', 'great', 'ride', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret']",N/A

1012433,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B000HCO83G,Kaya Savas,"[7, 12]","MOVIE: The supposed final installment in the X-Men trilogy opened to some amazing numbers, but the overall experience was less than spectacular. Sure it was entertaining with some amazing visual effects, but it was just very plain and did not exceed or offer anything new. The movie never felt like it was going anywhere, I never felt a sense of progression or a sense of accomplishment by the time it ended. We all know the story, Magneto continues to lead an army of mutants against humanity to prevent them from mass producing a cure to the mutant gene. The objective is to infilitrate Alcatraz Island and kill the boy who they are harvesting the ingrediants from that are necessary to making the vaccine. The movie is a short 1 hour and 45 minutes, and the pacing is incredibly horrible. We open with a flashback where Xavier and Magneto go to recruit Jean Grey to the school. Here we see the very creepy and digitally altered faces of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen so that they seem young since it is a flashback. The digital age reversal was obvious and was the only CGI work that I found awkward. The rest of the movie tries to create character relations between Jean Gray and Wolverine, but fails miserably. The whole film is incredibly hallow and empty, there is no substance to it. That is one noticeable difference that we see from Brett Ratner taking the director's chair. 20th Century Fox didn't want to wait for Bryan Singer since he was doing Superman, so they wen't along with the production and hired Ratner. Why couldn't they wait is beyond me, it wouldn't have affected box office performance, Memorial Day Weekend is an overrated movie weekend in my opinion. So, with no interesting character relations we are left with a very disorganized and melodramatic action movie. The visual effects and the make-up in the film were astounding, and so was John Powell's score. I thought that John Powell did a much better job with the music than John Ottman did. One huge thing that I caught in the movie that really bothered me was that there was a huge continuity error. It happened right after Magneto detached the Golden Gate Bridge and put it on Alcatraz. Right before he places the bridge down it is broad daylight. However, instantaneously we switch from day to night. There was no time transition or cutaway to signal a passage of time. It really bothered me that they let something like that slip into such a high profile film as this. So, instead of being an intelligent film about the intolerance of mankind, we now get a shallow and simplemined action film.ACTING: All the parts were overacted to a point where it became painful to listen to some lines. Some of the dialogue was delivered so poorly, and there were a few one-liners that lacked the punch they needed. Ian McKellen is the only strength of the film with Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart delivering good performances as well. The rest of the cast was just plain bad. Vinny Jones as Juggernaut was rediculous, and so was Kelsey Grammer as Beast. How Halle Berry won an Oscar still baffles me since she cannot act to save her life. Famke Janssen noticeably overacts as well, I mean how is she supposed to play two people if she is hardly able to handle just one. I blame the script for the acting problems given the poor dialogue.BOTTOM LINE: What kind of ""Last Stand"" was this? They left the end so wide open for another installment. Also, if you stay and watch the credits there is a bonus scene afterwards that also leaves the movie even wider open for another installment. They are already working on spin-offs of Wolverine and Magneto, so I really can't see Fox stopping with the main X-Men series since it's proven to be such a huge moneymaker.

I could spend a lot of time getting into why Brett Ratner is as much to blame for the this as Joel Shumacher was for the near fall of the cinematic Batman.  We may very well be one sequel away from a screenplay riddled with puns and fight scenes choreographed like a Broadway show or Disney on ice.  Don't hold me to it...all I'm saying is that this disappointing garbage is a few more steps in that direction.X3 (because us American's love for our blockbuster movies to have the shortest colloquialisms possible) mimics the Dark Phoenix saga by legendary comic writer Chris Claremont, and it mixes that arc with a newer story I'm not so familiar with. I'm assuming this is where the idea of the mutant cure comes from.  In short, there is a cure available and it might mean the end of mutants, so we might be tempted to ask ourselves some important questions and a better filmmaker like Bryan Singer may have made these questions far more clear and allowed the answers to cut more deeply.  We've developed differently our whole lives, so how much would we really enjoy being like everyone else on Earth?  What does Mystique, a shape-shifter who prefers to walk around blue and scaley as opposed to adjusting her appearance like we know she can, really think of this opportunity?  What about everyone else and how can a director address this with such a large cast?  Ratner is not up to the task of making these observations interesting...he does however know how to direct straight action and make a highly commercial film.  He did his job.Singer on the other hand brought a tremendous amount of emotion and soul to his films, and he did this without being remotely heavy-handed.  As a bonus he could also deliver straight action, but in his films we actually cared about the characters.  In the second X-Men film we got to see Pyro blast some cops in front of Bobby Drake's house and then we got to see Bobby fly away with the other mutants, but instead of seeing some more explosions and loud jet engines, we see Bobby briefly glance at his family who just betrayed him...and we connect.  Here in X3, I honestly just wanted to see the fire guy fight the ice dude.  I wasn't buying into the characters anymore and the all-too-often clunky dialogue didn't help either.  All the characters that were carried over from the other films are almost just empty shells of themselves from the previous movies, so I felt as if I had to think back to when I gave a damn.But it's not all bad.  Jean Grey's return from death in X2 as the ultra-powerful mutant Phoenix is fun to watch and the film doesn't pull punches to work toward a definitive end to the series (another reason an additional sequel could be dangerous). I'm not a real fan of the comic, but I'm familiar with it enough to know that hardcore fans have countless concerns for how there favorite characters are portrayed.  It's not a horrible movie in comparison to some movies of it's ilk.  The real disdain for me lies in how X3 betrays the depth of the first two films.",2,Wolverine doesn't cry!

Loria,"[6, 8]","With the new X-MEN finally comes the climax to the great philosophical and physical war between Charles Xavier and Magneto (both portrayed superbly by Star Trek's Patrick Steward and LOTR's Sir Ian McKellen). The original X-men movie is single-handedly responsible for proving that a decent MARVEL superhero movie could be made, effectively paving the way for SPIDER-MAN, which raised the bar even higher for the genre. In X-MEN: the LAST STAND, the mutants of Xaiver's school are back and growing in number as more comic characters are included in the third installment of the film series. Notable are the additions of KELSEY GRAMMER as the cerebral blue-furred BEAST a.k.a. Dr. Hank Mcoy . The BEAST was one of the 60's comic book original X-Men, along with the winged mutant THE ANGEL, played by Ben Foster (6 Feet Under). Vinnie Jones  is  the unstoppable fighting machine Juggernaut(who does not appear to be related to Prof. X in this incarnation). Other mutants returning for extended appearences are Kitty Pryde a.k.a. SHADOWCAT who can pass thru walls, more of the steel-skinned Colossus, more from the traitorous PYRO. Oscar-winner Anna Paquin returns as ROGUE,struggling with her relations & mutant powers. Shawn Ashmore again plays Bobby Drake a.k.a ICEMAN, throwing comic fans a frosty treat appearing briefly in ice-form. Rebecca Romijn is back in her glorious blue nakedness as the evil Mystique and Aaron Stanford as the disgruntled PYRO. James Marsden returns (briefly) as a grief-stricken Cyclops, even his lost-lady-love returns with Famke Janssen again as Jean Grey and more(read story summary below). Of course, Hugh Jackman returns as Wolverine, Jackman is still a perfect Wolverine. Oscar winner Halle Berry is back as the weather-controlling STORM, who finally flies in this one, sort of an homage to their former director's new project (read on.).Along with all the new mutants, another addition is the director himself, losing Bryan Singer to this summers SUPERMAN RETURNS, X-MEN 3 is directed by BRETT RATNER (RUSH HOUR 1&2) Brett Ratner is still keeping with the recurring theme of mutants still struggling with acceptance, their powers and whether or not they even want those powers.I think the plot is more interesting than the previous two....here's the story (plot spoilers ahead):A  potential ""cure"" is discovered and processed to treat -- and ultimately eliminate -- genetic mutations, once and for all. . Mutants have a choice: retain their abilities, inspite of it isolating them, or give up their powers becoming human. Prof. X, advocate of tolerance between human and mutantkind, and the leader of the Brotherhood, Magneto, Xavier's fallen-friend who believes that bring mankind to their knees is the only path to peace, finally have the battle we've waited 2 movies to see. The X-Men vs. the brotherhood vs. humankind. They must also face their former teammate, Jean Grey's unleasing the Dark Phoenix, her super-powered alter-ego (I mean ""super-powered"" like change the script kind of power)danger to the entire planet.This is a good effort, especially with the nortoriously unlucky number ""3"" following the name. It has a lot of the mutant characters we've been waiting for, it even has the long overdue pairing of Colossus and Wolverine in battle together. As well as more effective use of Wolverine in combat scenes, which the other movies do more sparingly than you mght expect. The music in this one is distractly melodramatic at times thought.

I have nothing against him in other X-Men media, but his film incarnation irritated me.  It was cool to see Angel, though I think they should have spent more time making his wings look more realistic.The good things about this movie were Juggernaut, who had a sense of humor that so many of the characters lost in the transition from comics to film; Kitty, who finally had a significant role and held her own quite nicely in the final battle; Beast, who actually kept his personality from the comics; and Rogue and Bobby overcoming the physical challenge of their relationship, which was a relief to me.  However, I am also glad that the DVD contained an alternate ending to Rogue's decision about the ""mutant cure;"" I liked being able to see both versions.  Even though the movie's ending was depressing, I appreciated the fact that it wrapped up most of the plot threads from the previous movies.As usual, Patrick Stewart was good as Professor X and Ian McKellen was excellent as Magneto.

I had faith that Bret Ratner would craft an intelligent and fun movie to watch.  It isn't exactly faithful to the comics, but what it is faithful to is the spirit of the comics.  THe only complaints I really have is that Cyclops was taken out of the movie too early and one must wonder if his extremely limited role was due to Marsden's role in Superman Returns.  Apparantly there was alot of bad blood between the two studios over that.  Anyway, X-Men 3 is a good movie.

1012444,AJW6KG5ATLE8H,B000HCO83G,"K. Olsen-Keyser ""BookChick""","[6, 8]","In defense of Director Brett Ratner, he did the best he could under the time constraints for this film and the fact that Singer abandoned his ""child"" to direct Superman Returns. Writers Kinberg and Penn are seasoned pros, but both came into the film after Singer left and took the original screenwriters, Harris and Dougherty with him to Superman. Basically, they started with nothing and were able to create something just above nothing. Its the same old tired out storyline of good mutants versus evil mutants with a little bit of modern day political agenda thrown in for good measure.It is not just the poor screenplay that ruins the film. Unfortunately, The Last Stand lacks the acting necessary to carry what is supposed to be one of the most tear-jerking, intense narratives in the X-Men comics, The Dark Phoenix Saga. Typical of comic book films lately, do not expect to find the original story arc in this movie. The dialogue between our heroes is tedious, a slap in the face to readers who know that Marvel Comics have always been cerebral in nature. The special effects are not up to par and even the actor chosen for the minor role of President was horrible. (Cotter Smith where were you?) This film was a huge disappointment and an embarrassment to the X-Men franchise.There were major faux pas and incongruities in this film. Beware! If you have not seen the film, there are spoilers ahead. Stop reading now and know that if you are a fan of the X-Men series you will be very dissatisfied. Stick with the first two and pretend this film was never put to celluloid.In an opening scene, we see Professor X walk to the Grey's door. Prof. X was paralyzed before he started the School for the Gifted and so would have been in his wheelchair at this point. Instead of using clever dialogue to establish that we are in the past, the writers and director chose to cop out and remove a prop that should have been present if they had back checked their facts.The Phoenix kills Scott in the first twenty minutes of the movie. While the Phoenix side of Jean might not get along with Scott, she never would have outright killed him. Not only is this anti-climatic, but clearly, the only reason for his death was that the actor (Marsden) had other obligations i.e.: Superman Returns.Where was the Phoenix? Jean looks more like a goth girl gone wrong rather than the fiery entity of the Phoenix. We never get to see her rise from the ashes in a blazing inferno. Singer had clearly laid the groundwork in the second movie; her eyes had fire in the them and at the end of the film, we saw the Phoenix fly across the lake. That idea was obviously trashed when the new director took over.The scenes involving Wolverine and Storm debating/arguing are forced and tiresome. It seems as though the director gave up on accents in this film as Ororo went from having a strained Kenyan accent in the first movie to none at all by the third. Of course, it may be that Ms. Berry had difficulty acting her part or was asked to stop attempting the accent.The entire middle of the film was unnecessary. There were too many scenes of Magneto rousing the troops, too many cut scenes to the forest (yes we get it, he is in the woods!) too much of the President babbling ""God Help Us"" or gathering the troops. Where were the scenes of Jean/Phoenix struggling with the fact that she had just killed her lover/husband and her mentor/father figure?Why bother introducing characters like Callisto, Psylocke, Spike (who are not mentioned by name) and Archlight if only to kill them off unceremoniously at the end of the film?Why kill off Jean - again.One creative point of the movie was Jean's split personality disorder creating the Phoenix rather than an alien entity. It would have been more poignant, however, if Jean had lived, having to face that she had killed the people she loved most in life. There is no real justice or even remotely successful conclusion to this film.",2,X-Men:The Last Stand does not deliver in a jumbled mess of dull dialogue and poor acting.,1198022400,"12 19, 2007",2007,3954,"['defense', 'Director', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'time', 'constraints', 'film', 'fact', 'Singer', 'abandoned', 'child', 'direct', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'Writers', 'Kinberg', 'Penn', 'are', 'seasoned', 'pros', 'came', 'film', 'Singer', 'left', 'took', 'original', 'screenwriters', 'Harris', 'Dougherty', 'Superman', 'Basically', 'started', 'nothing', 'were', 'able', 'create', 'something', 'just', 'nothing', 'same', 'old', 'tired', 'out', 'storyline', 'good', 'mutants', 'versus', 'evil', 'mutants', 'little', 'bit', 'modern', 'day', 'political', 'agenda', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure.It', 'not', 'just', 'poor', 'screenplay', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'Last', 'Stand', 'acting', 'necessary', 'carry', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'tear-jerking', 'intense', 'narratives', 'X-Men', 'comics', 'Dark', 'Phoenix', 'Saga', 'Typical', 'comic', 'book', 'films', 'lately', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'find', 'original', 'story', 'arc', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'heroes', 'tedious', 'slap', 'face', 'readers', 'who', 'know', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'cerebral', 'nature', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'not', 'par', 'even', 'actor', 'chosen', 'minor', 'role', 'President', 'was', 'horrible', 'Cotter', 'Smith', 'where', 'were', 'film', 'was', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'embarrassment', 'X-Men', 'franchise.There', 'were', 'major', 'faux', 'pas', 'incongruities', 'film', 'Beware', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'are', 'spoilers', 'ahead', 'Stop', 'reading', 'now', 'know', 'are', 'fan', 'X-Men', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'dissatisfied', 'Stick', 'first', 'two', 'pretend', 'film', 'was', 'never', 'put', 'celluloid.In', 'opening', 'scene', 'see', 'Professor', 'X', 'walk', 'Grey', 'door', 'Prof.', 'X', 'was', 'paralyzed', 'started', 'School', 'Gifted', 'so', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'wheelchair', 'point', 'Instead', 'using', 'clever', 'dialogue', 'establish', 'are', 'past', 'writers', 'director', 'chose', 'cop', 'out', 'remove', 'prop', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'present', 'had', 'back', 'checked', 'facts.The', 'Phoenix', 'kills', 'Scott', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Phoenix', 'side', 'Jean', 'might', 'not', 'get', 'Scott', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'outright', 'killed', 'Not', 'only', 'anti-climatic', 'clearly', 'only', 'reason', 'death', 'was', 'actor', 'Marsden', 'had', 'other', 'obligations', 'i.e', 'Superman', 'Returns.Where', 'was', 'Phoenix', 'Jean', 'more', 'goth', 'girl', 'gone', 'wrong', 'rather', 'fiery', 'entity', 'Phoenix', 'never', 'get', 'see', 'rise', 'ashes', 'blazing', 'inferno', 'Singer', 'had', 'clearly', 'laid', 'groundwork', 'second', 'movie', 'eyes', 'had', 'fire', 'end', 'film', 'saw', 'Phoenix', 'fly', 'lake', 'idea', 'was', 'obviously', 'trashed', 'when', 'new', 'director', 'took', 'over.The', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Wolverine', 'Storm', 'debating/arguing', 'are', 'forced', 'tiresome', 'director', 'gave', 'up', 'accents', 'film', 'Ororo', 'went', 'having', 'strained', 'Kenyan', 'accent', 'first', 'movie', 'none', 'third', 'course', 'may', 'be', 'Ms.', 'Berry', 'had', 'difficulty', 'acting', 'part', 'was', 'asked', 'stop', 'attempting', 'accent.The', 'entire', 'middle', 'film', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'Magneto', 'rousing', 'troops', 'too', 'many', 'cut', 'scenes', 'forest', 'yes', 'get', 'woods', 'too', 'much', 'President', 'babbling', 'God', 'Help', 'Us', 'gathering', 'troops', 'Where', 'were', 'scenes', 'Jean/Phoenix', 'struggling', 'fact', 'had', 'just', 'killed', 'lover/husband', 'mentor/father', 'figure', 'Why', 'bother', 'introducing', 'characters', 'Callisto', 'Psylocke', 'Spike', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'mentioned', 'name', 'Archlight', 'only', 'kill', 'off', 'unceremoniously', 'end', 'film', 'Why', 'kill', 'off', 'Jean', 'again.One', 'creative', 'point', 'movie', 'was', 'Jean', 'split', 'personality', 'disorder', 'creating', 'Phoenix', 'rather', 'alien', 'entity', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'poignant', 'however', 'Jean', 'had', 'lived', 'having', 'face', 'had', 'killed', 'people', 'loved', 'most', 'life', 'real', 'justice', 'even', 'remotely', 'successful', 'conclusion', 'film']",N/A

1012448,A30IP5D5DLHRPA,B000HCO83G,Kyle Slayzar,"[1, 2]","X3 was one of the movies I was looking forward to seeing this year and I was somewhat pleased.  There were many ups, but some downs that almost ruined the movie.So the pros.  The acting was nicely done, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry and others did an above and beyond performance given the stigma of bad acting in Marvel pictures (ie: Fantastic Four).  I was very pleased with Hugh Jackman's performance as Wolverine as he assumed command during critical parts of the movie.As to the plot, the movie started out somewhat slow as events built up, then sped up dramatically and ended just as quickly.  It almost seemed as though the entire movie was being built up for this one final 15-minute showdown.  It was somwhat disapointing.  The plot also killed more main characters than a Quentin Terrentino movie as main heroes were almost being picked off from beginning to end, one by one.Lastly on the plot... I don't think X3 was meant as the finishing movie for the X-Men franchise.  The ending (like many trilogies try to do) sets you up for a sequel as Magneeto's ending has a cliffhanger and STAY AFTER THE CREDITS to see another one with another main character.  I think Stan Lee is setting us up for a sequel... and I was disapointed with how it was done.One of the other things I wish the director did was allow more time for character developement.  There were two characters I never caught the name of... until I read reviews online.  The two characters being Calypso and that girl that walked through walls... forgot her name again.  Also, there was no clarification on Wolverine's past.  Granted I watched the series, read the comics etc, etc and I know a little, but I think it would've been nice for the general audience.Then there's the consistency errors.  Any fans of the series knows that Juggarnut is technically NOT a mutant but apperantly he was taken down because his ""powers"" were leeched.  I was pleased, however, to see the producers remembered that Hank (Beast) likes to read upsidedown and to include the Danger Room.Pertaining to the visuals... nothing but impressive and the display of mutant powers was incredible.  I have officially dubbed Storm as the Sith Lord of the X-Men world... watch how she deals with her nemisis in the showdown to see what I mean.  They also showed the true form of Iceman, which was also nice and even Pyro's weapons.

I WANT GAMBIT!!  I don't care if Stan Lee says he's a shallow character, Gambit is awesome.All in all, an 85% and a solid movie to boot.  One worthy of my movie collection when it comes out on DVD.

1012450,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000HCO83G,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 1]","We watched the first ""X-Men"" film in the afternoon, ""X-Men United"" last night, and then went to the midnight showing for ""X-Men: The Last Stand,"" where there was some serious cinematic discussions going on touching on everything from Rosebud in ""Citizen Kane"" to ""Platoon.""  But once they showed the trailer for ""Superman Returns"" the crowd immediately got back into the appropriate literary frame of reference for the proceedings.For those expecting to see the Phoenix saga from the ""X-Men"" comic books played out it is quickly made clear that is not going to happen.  We begin two decades ago, when Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Eric Lensherr (Ian McKellen) visit the home of young Jean Grey, where we learn this little girl is the only Level 5 mutant on the planet (No, the idea of levels is not explored further, but my best guess would be that Professor X, Magneto, Storm and Callisto are Level 4s, and no clue about the rest, although I would think Wolverine is just an upgraded 2 because his healing powers are natural but the claws are not).  Phoenix is now the unconscious side of the powers of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), and after years of being controlled by Xavier's mental blocks, the beast is out.  That is something Logan (Hugh Jackman) can relate to, but he does not like the idea that the professor has been messing with the mind of the woman he loves.The other element from the past prologue is young Warren Worthington III, trying to hide from his father that he is starting to have wings grow out of his back.  Father and son are ashamed, but what matters is that daddy (Michael Murphy) has enough money to do something about it.  Then we pick up the narrative in the not too distant future where relationships between humans and mutants has apparently improved to the point that Dr. Hank McCoy (Kelsey Grammer) is Secretary of Mutant Affairs in the cabinet of the president (Josef Sommer).  Meanwhile, a distraught Scott Summers (James Marsden), hearing Jean's voice in his head goes back to Alkali Lake to exorcise his pain, only to find out what we all know: the woman he loves is not dead.  She is just different.  Big time.However, that is not the big problem, because Worthington announces that he has found a mutant, Leech (Cameron Bright), who can ""cure"" mutants.  A magic formula has been created and if you do not want to be a mutant, your wish can come true.  But for Magneto, who still bears the number tattooed on his arm in a Nazi concentration camp knows full well, the government can always decide to cure mutants in the name of national self interest.  Besides, he does not think mutants need a cure, and he rallies an army to his banner to join him alongside Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) and Pyro (Aaron Stanford) (part of the fun is seeing who shows up).  Meanwhile, Storm (Halley Balle) has to take a bigger leadership role with the X-Men, where Rogue (Anna Paquin), who cannot touch another living soul because she can kill them absorbing their powers, is desperate enough  to take the cure.My primary cryptic complaints about the film are as follows.  First, we did not realize that the first X-Men to die in the film had actually died.  Only one of the deaths really had emotional resonance, mainly because I am a big ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" fan so it was really ""been there, done that"" for the final death.  But part of the problem is that we expect the dead to come back in these movies (Gandalf came back, Electra came back, hands up if you think we will see Dumbledore again).  Second, making Bobby Drake young enough for Iceman to be part of the next generation of X-Men with Rogue, Colossus and Shadowcat sets up an implied love triangle that rubs against the grain because the two things we know about Kitty is she walks through walls and loves Peter.  At least they did not cross the line in this film with that regard but they skate pretty close to it (literally).  Third, where was the Phoenix effect?  They set up the whole thing at the end of the second movie as we see the shape of the Phoenix beneath the waters of Alkali Lake and I waited for Jean Grey to go full-blown Phoenix, but she just stays on the cusp.However, there are more things I liked about the film.  The second scene at the home of Jean Grey is the most memorable in the movie, I liked the fact that the American military are better prepared for an assault by Magneto and his, and any scene in which Stewart and McKellen have a conversation makes you think they are still doing.  The script makes good use of Kitty and her powers (she has the single best fight movie in the film), and Wolverine and the Beast bickering is fun.  The key thing is that you have to go with the movie and not let your expectations be colored by the comic books you have read, because those will just prove to be false paths.  I was convinced that in the end Magneto was going to be leading the X-Men in an effort to stop Phoenix, and that Jean was going to regain control long enough to use the cure on herself, but all of that was from what I have read (and what Chris Claremont and John Bryne wanted to have be the original ending of the Dark Phoenix saga).  This could be the last X-Men movie simply because of the relatively high body count, but on the other hand the roster of merry mutants has been evolving to such a high degree since Claremont and Dave Cockrum brought them back with the international flair that you kill one of the X-Men and you have a half-dozen to take their place.",4,"Just remember, this is not the comic book version of the Dark

I myself don't know enough to say; all I know is that I enjoyed the story and all the non-stop action and special effects. Dozens of new X-men with different talents are introduced, and part of the fun is just seeing what will happen there next. Relationship-wise, this movie focuses on Wolverine and Jean, who is now the only class 5 mutant known, even more powerful than Magneto. I note one reviewer here who said he wasn't happy with Patrick Stewart getting killed--but he should have stayed through the end of the credits--there's one final brief scene where we learn that isn't final. The climactic scene with the Golden Gate Bridge has to be the best special effects scene of the year. My only criticism, which is small (and the reason I rate it four stars instead of five) is that I think they made too much of Jean's mental instability. I don't see why a super powerful X man (or woman, in this case) would automatically be mentally unstable and need to be psychologically conditioned and controlled as Stewart was doing with Jean so that they wouldn't go crazy and cause harm.

1012461,A16B7K7YGKO9PR,B000HCO83G,Major Tom,"[0, 2]","How much does a director really influence a film? Bryan Singer bailed on the X-Men franchise (to make the underwhelming Superman Returns), and fans collectively howled at the hiring of Brett Ratner to helm this pivotal installment. But it's really NOT THAT BAD of a film. I will state three small problems with the film; SPOILERS GALORE, people!1 From the beginning, it's a tease. We have the X-gang in the danger room. Cool. We even have Colossus launch Wolverine for a ""fastball special"". Right out of the comic, cool. At what is he being launched? A light that's attacking them. He then scissors off and throws down a Sentinel's head, all off camera. So once again, we don't get to see the Sentinels in an X-Men film. Probably too costly to bring to the screen, or it was either them or the Golden Gate Bridge scene.2 Some characters have virtually nothing to do, like Rogue. Some characters are introduced to merely move the story along, like Angel. And one major character is killed offscreen, inexplicably. That major character deserved WAYYY better than that.3 Some of the acting is plain hammy, even for these movies. Even the usually reliable Hugh Jackman has some shaky moments. I realize, it's comic book derived material, not Shakespeare. But maybe the bad acting signals Ratner's directing influence, maybe not.Things I did like about this film: the characters they added just plain rock! Kelsey Grammar as Beast, Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut, and a cute new actress playing Kitty / Shadowcat. It's good casting all around. And the script is really over the top, overstuffed with action and plot. There's something going on at almost all times, unlike the ponderous quality of Singer's X-Men, and the special effects are eye popping. And there are many great memorable moments (Iceman Vs. Pyro, Kitty Vs. Juggernaut, Mystique: cured and naked). What I don't understand is why they were bent on making this the last one--maybe they thought it was too expensive or logisically difficult to get this massive cast together. Hopefully they make more X-films, as this one was a box office smash. Keep them coming, keep up the quality, and the fans will be there.",3,A total crowd pleaser---not that bad at all..,1160956800,"10 16, 2006",2006,2167,"['How', 'much', 'director', 'really', 'influence', 'film', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'bailed', 'X-Men', 'franchise', 'make', 'underwhelming', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'fans', 'collectively', 'howled', 'hiring', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'helm', 'pivotal', 'installment', 'really', 'NOT', 'THAT', 'BAD', 'film', 'will', 'state', 'three', 'small', 'problems', 'film', 'SPOILERS', 'GALORE', 'people', '1', 'beginning', 'tease', 'have', 'X-gang', 'danger', 'room', 'Cool', 'even', 'have', 'Colossus', 'launch', 'Wolverine', 'fastball', 'special', 'Right', 'comic', 'cool', 'what', 'being', 'launched', 'light', 'attacking', 'then', 'down', 'Sentinel', 'head', 'off', 'camera', 'So', 'once', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'Sentinels', 'X-Men', 'film', 'Probably', 'too', 'costly', 'bring', 'screen', 'was', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', 'scene.2', 'characters', 'have', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'do', 'Rogue', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'merely', 'move', 'story', 'along', 'Angel', 'one', 'major', 'character', 'killed', 'offscreen', 'inexplicably', 'major', 'character', 'deserved', 'WAYYY', 'better', 'that.3', 'acting', 'plain', 'hammy', 'even', 'movies', 'Even', 'usually', 'reliable', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'shaky', 'moments', 'realize', 'comic', 'book', 'derived', 'material', 'not', 'Shakespeare', 'maybe', 'bad', 'acting', 'signals', 'Ratner', 'directing', 'influence', 'maybe', 'not.Things', 'did', 'like', 'film', 'characters', 'added', 'just', 'plain', 'rock', 'Kelsey', 'Grammar', 'Beast', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'Juggernaut', 'cute', 'new', 'actress', 'playing', 'Kitty', '/', 'Shadowcat', 'good', 'casting', 'script', 'really', 'top', 'overstuffed', 'action', 'plot', 'something', 'going', 'almost', 'times', 'ponderous', 'quality', 'Singer', 'X-Men', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'eye', 'popping', 'are', 'many', 'great', 'memorable', 'moments', 'Iceman', 'Vs.', 'Pyro', 'Kitty', 'Vs.', 'Juggernaut', 'Mystique', 'cured', 'naked', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'were', 'bent', 'making', 'last', 'one', 'maybe', 'thought', 'was', 'too', 'expensive', 'logisically', 'difficult', 'get', 'massive', 'cast', 'together', 'Hopefully', 'make', 'more', 'X-films', 'one', 'was', 'box', 'office', 'smash', 'Keep', 'coming', 'keep', 'quality', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'there']",N/A

1012463,A3R4ZEDVRUWJNO,B000HCO83G,Mark,"[0, 2]","X-Men: The Last Stand gets a new director, and it is Brett Ratner, the inconsistent, some times over the top director, whose only really strong film was 2002's Red Dragon (in which he also directed the third part of a trilogy, and also taking it from the previous two's director, Jonathan Demme).  Ratner seems to want to make his own version, so the first thing he does is give many of the previous films' characters the backseat.  And by previous characters, I mean really important ones.  Cyclops, Rogue (who seemed to be the main character of the first), and even Professor Xavier.  Moving these characters out of the way, he seems to focus his attention on Wolverine and Storm.  This puzzled me, because, don't we already know everything about Wolverine?  Why make him the main character, when there are so many more interesting people; Hank McCoy for instance.  And why make Storm the main character?  If Ratner wanted to do this, he should at least give background information about her past.  At the beginning of the trilogy, we know nothing about Storm, and Ratner adds no information by the end.  It's hard to sympathize with a character we know nothing about.  Ratner then creates a host of new mutants, too many to even count.  I found myself asking, Why?  Weren't there enough already?  Towards the end of the film, in the climactic battle, I found myself getting confused as to who all of these people were.  What is the point of clogging up the screen with all of these unneccesary people?  If you're going to do that, don't waste your time explaining what every one of these hundred mutants can do.  We won't remember anyway.  My advice would have been to stick to the basics.  Do what Sam Raimi does with Spiderman.  Only introduce 1-3 characters per film.  If you kill one off, don't replace it with ten more.  The film does not get my reccomendation, but I say respectfully because of the wonderful performance of Ian McKellen (who just signed on to do a film centered around Magneto).  McKellen is the only character who feels like he's flowed perfectly throughout each film; some of the others are jerky and inconsistent, Wolverine for example.  His performance is a tour de force, and every minute he's on screen is a triumph, an electric event, a force not to be reckoned with.  His performance builds and builds, and the ending sequence (I won't really reveal it), in which he doesn't even speak, is brilliant and heartbreaking.  Actors usually win awards for these strong performances, and, while I'm sure the Academy won't consider this film for anything but Special Effects, McKellen should be given something.  This performance, along with the mind-blowing special effects, are the only redeeming qualities to this film.  The film moves way too fast, never gets focused, and it's social commentary isn't unlike anything we've ever seen before.  Yes, some of it is important, but we have already heard all of this stuff before.  Ratner takes a perfectly good franchise and gives it a less-than-satisfying conclusion, with the exception of Magneto.  Watch the film, if only for McKellen's performance, and marvel (pardon the comic book pun, it wasn't intentional) at what a great actor he really is.",2,Respectfully Not Reccomended,1159920000,"10 4, 2006",2006,3225,"['X-Men', 'Last', 'Stand', 'new', 'director', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'inconsistent', 'times', 'top', 'director', 'only', 'really', 'strong', 'film', 'was', '2002', 'Red', 'Dragon', 'also', 'directed', 'third', 'part', 'trilogy', 'also', 'taking', 'previous', 'two', 'director', 'Jonathan', 'Demme', 'Ratner', 'want', 'make', 'own', 'version', 'first', 'thing', 'give', 'many', 'previous', 'films', 'characters', 'backseat', 'previous', 'characters', 'mean', 'really', 'important', 'ones', 'Cyclops', 'Rogue', 'who', 'seemed', 'be', 'main', 'character', 'first', 'even', 'Professor', 'Xavier', 'Moving', 'characters', 'way', 'focus', 'attention', 'Wolverine', 'Storm', 'puzzled', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'everything', 'Wolverine', 'Why', 'make', 'main', 'character', 'when', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'interesting', 'people', 'Hank', 'McCoy', 'instance', 'why', 'make', 'Storm', 'main', 'character', 'Ratner', 'wanted', 'do', 'should', 'least', 'give', 'background', 'information', 'past', 'beginning', 'trilogy', 'know', 'nothing', 'Storm', 'Ratner', 'information', 'end', 'hard', 'sympathize', 'character', 'know', 'nothing', 'Ratner', 'then', 'host', 'new', 'mutants', 'too', 'many', 'even', 'count', 'found', 'asking', 'Why', 'Were', ""n't"", 'there', 'enough', 'already', 'end', 'film', 'climactic', 'battle', 'found', 'getting', 'confused', 'who', 'people', 'were', 'What', 'point', 'clogging', 'up', 'screen', 'unneccesary', 'people', ""'re"", 'going', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'explaining', 'what', 'one', 'hundred', 'mutants', 'can', 'do', 'wo', ""n't"", 'remember', 'anyway', 'My', 'advice', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'stick', 'basics', 'Do', 'what', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'Spiderman', 'Only', 'introduce', '1-3', 'characters', 'film', 'kill', 'one', 'off', 'do', ""n't"", 'replace', 'ten', 'more', 'film', 'not', 'get', 'reccomendation', 'say', 'respectfully', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'who', 'just', 'signed', 'do', 'film', 'centered', 'Magneto', 'McKellen', 'only', 'character', 'who', 'flowed', 'perfectly', 'film', 'others', 'are', 'jerky', 'inconsistent', 'Wolverine', 'example', 'performance', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'minute', 'screen', 'triumph', 'electric', 'event', 'force', 'not', 'be', 'reckoned', 'performance', 'builds', 'builds', 'ending', 'sequence', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'reveal', ""n't"", 'even', 'speak', 'brilliant', 'heartbreaking', 'Actors', 'usually', 'win', 'awards', 'strong', 'performances', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Academy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'consider', 'film', 'anything', 'Special', 'Effects', 'McKellen', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'something', 'performance', 'mind-blowing', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'only', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'film', 'film', 'way', 'too', 'fast', 'never', 'focused', 'social', 'commentary', ""n't"", 'anything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'before', 'Yes', 'important', 'have', 'already', 'heard', 'stuff', 'Ratner', 'perfectly', 'good', 'franchise', 'less-than-satisfying', 'conclusion', 'exception', 'Magneto', 'Watch', 'film', 'only', 'McKellen', 'performance', 'marvel', 'comic', 'book', 'pun', 'was', ""n't"", 'intentional', 'what', 'great', 'actor', 'really']",N/A

1012470,A2OM316GK7MPHT,B000HCO83G,"Matthew Kapsiotis ""mk915""","[2, 4]","""X-Men: The Last Stand"" (X3) is the third installment of the X-Men films which satisfied and disappointed many fans of the series as well.  Personally, I really enjoyed seeing the film in theaters and was satisfied with the movie overall.  However, I do have to say that although I enjoyed the movie, it certainly did not meet its potential for numerous reasons.Here are some of the positives about the movie.  First, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, and Patrick Stewart once again did a great job with their roles.  Ditto for Halle Berry and Kelsey Grammar as Storm and Beast.  Next, the action scenes provided non-stop excitement and drama.  In addition, the plot provided much intrigue with mutants being able to decide whether to take the cure or remain a mutant.  This particular storyline was great in the animated series with Dr. Adler (Apocalypse) and did justice for the movie as well.Where the movie falls a little short is the character development.  For example, Ratner never really develops the mini love triangle between Kitty, Rogue, and Bobby.  But Ratner's biggest blunder is not putting the necessary focus on the Phoenix storyline.  This was an immensely popular storyline in the comic books as well as the animated series and certainly deserved more attention and screentime.  Also, the movie portrayed Wolverine as the only member of the X-Men who cared about Jean's turn to the dark Phoenix, which is simply not the case in the comics.  The X-Men teamed up in the comics with the goal of bringing Jean back to her normal self.  This should have and could have been done in this movie, especially since Ratner made the movie only 140 minutes.  Had he used half an hour more, he could have made this aspect more complete.Some claim that there were too many deaths in the movie (i.e. Cyclops & Xavier) which is true to some degree.  Cyclops should have played a bigger role and not been killed off.  But I think Ratner added a lot of drama by killing Xavier (supposedly).  I certainly was stunned in the theater.Overall, X3 was very good, but simply was not as good as it could have been.  The best movie of the series was X2, and any shortcomings of this film should be blamed on Brian Singer for foolishly leaving this series to do Superman.  X3 made more money and was much more important than Superman, which had been a dead franchise for years.  Don't get me wrong, I love Superman, but when you start something, finish it!Bottom Line: Good movie, buy the DVD.  I would recommend getting the Stan Lee Collector's Edition ONLY if you want to get the bonus comic book.  Otherwise, the regular DVD has everything the Collector's Edition has.  Warning: A recent report said that about 60% of X-Men: The Last Stand DVD's had errors on them.  They all operate fine, but some people got 21 deleted scenes while others, like myself, only got 10.  I don't value the deleted scenes very much, but if you do, please note this fact.",4,"Very Good Movie, But Didn't Match Its Potential",1160092800,"10 6, 2006",2006,2939,"['X-Men', 'Last', 'Stand', 'X3', 'third', 'installment', 'X-Men', 'films', 'satisfied', 'disappointed', 'many', 'fans', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'Personally', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'film', 'theaters', 'was', 'satisfied', 'movie', 'overall', 'However', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'certainly', 'did', 'not', 'meet', 'potential', 'numerous', 'reasons.Here', 'are', 'positives', 'movie', 'First', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'once', 'again', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'roles', 'Ditto', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Kelsey', 'Grammar', 'Storm', 'Beast', 'Next', 'action', 'scenes', 'provided', 'non-stop', 'excitement', 'drama', 'addition', 'plot', 'provided', 'much', 'intrigue', 'mutants', 'being', 'able', 'decide', 'take', 'cure', 'remain', 'mutant', 'particular', 'storyline', 'was', 'great', 'animated', 'series', 'Dr.', 'Adler', 'Apocalypse', 'did', 'justice', 'movie', 'well.Where', 'movie', 'little', 'short', 'character', 'development', 'example', 'Ratner', 'never', 'really', 'mini', 'love', 'triangle', 'Kitty', 'Rogue', 'Bobby', 'Ratner', 'biggest', 'blunder', 'not', 'putting', 'necessary', 'focus', 'Phoenix', 'storyline', 'was', 'immensely', 'popular', 'storyline', 'comic', 'books', 'as', 'well', 'animated', 'series', 'certainly', 'deserved', 'more', 'attention', 'screentime', 'Also', 'movie', 'portrayed', 'Wolverine', 'only', 'member', 'X-Men', 'who', 'cared', 'Jean', 'turn', 'dark', 'Phoenix', 'simply', 'not', 'case', 'comics', 'X-Men', 'teamed', 'up', 'comics', 'goal', 'bringing', 'Jean', 'back', 'normal', 'self', 'should', 'have', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'movie', 'especially', 'Ratner', 'made', 'movie', 'only', '140', 'minutes', 'Had', 'used', 'hour', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'aspect', 'more', 'complete.Some', 'claim', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'deaths', 'movie', 'i.e', 'Cyclops', 'Xavier', 'true', 'degree', 'Cyclops', 'should', 'have', 'played', 'bigger', 'role', 'not', 'been', 'killed', 'off', 'think', 'Ratner', 'added', 'lot', 'drama', 'killing', 'Xavier', 'supposedly', 'certainly', 'was', 'stunned', 'theater.Overall', 'X3', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'simply', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'movie', 'series', 'was', 'X2', 'shortcomings', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'blamed', 'Brian', 'Singer', 'foolishly', 'leaving', 'series', 'do', 'Superman', 'X3', 'made', 'more', 'money', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'important', 'Superman', 'had', 'been', 'dead', 'franchise', 'years', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'Superman', 'when', 'start', 'something', 'finish', 'Bottom', 'Line', 'Good', 'movie', 'buy', 'DVD', 'would', 'recommend', 'getting', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'ONLY', 'want', 'get', 'bonus', 'comic', 'book', 'Otherwise', 'regular', 'DVD', 'everything', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'Warning', 'recent', 'report', 'said', '60', '%', 'X-Men', 'Last', 'Stand', 'DVD', 'had', 'errors', 'operate', 'fine', 'people', 'got', '21', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'others', 'only', 'got', '10', 'do', ""n't"", 'value', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'very', 'much', 'do', 'please', 'note', 'fact']",N/A
1012471,A3JRHLMU5YA79B,B000HCO83G,Matthew Phillip Clayton,"[0, 3]","I expected the worse case scenario when I heard Brett Ratner was taking the reins of the ""X-Men"" franchise, after Bryan Singer bolted to helm ""Superman Returns"". The end product, for me, isn't bad at all and enjoyable to watch. It's competently directed (Ratner has stated that he wanted to maintain Singer's overall vision and he has done that in terms of look and feel of the film), well-acted, and the action sequences and CGI are very well-done. The score by John Powell is superb, heroic and gives emotional weight to the film (I highly recommend the soundtrack).But there are some bad sections that takes away from the movie's quality. The script seems rushed (not surprising considering that Fox greenlighted it quickly in order to make the May 26 date) and never scratches the surface of the complex moral and ethical issues presented in the storyline. The script also just tosses away some of the minor characters (such as Mystique and Cyclops) in favor of new ones (as well as giving into Halle Berry's demands for more screentime) without giving them a proper send-off. And lastly, part of the fault lies with the film's length -- sans ending credits -- the film runs just over an hour and a half long. There just isn't enough time to give the main characters depth and the storylines breathing room. Despite those flaws, ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is entertaining and worth revisiting, provided your expectations are sufficiently lowered to that of the first film.The movie is available in three flavors -- single-disc full-screen or anamorphic widescreen editions, a deluxe edition which packages the single-disc widescreen edition with a 100 page comic book and a Blu-ray edition.The single-disc edition DVD is excellent in terms of transfer quality. The 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer in on par with the previous two films -- spotless, beautiful black levels, rich colors, and wonderfully-film like from start to finish. But the audio is just stupendous and outperforms the first two in demonstration quality. For its DVD release, the audio was mastered by Mi Casa Multimedia (the guys who also mastered the ""Lord of the Rings"" DVDs) in Dolby Digital 5.1 EX and DTS 6.1 ES. Either track will give your surround system a thorough workout, particularly the Danger Room Sequence and the finale at Alcatraz Prison. The track is also subtle and completely immerses the viewer even in the dialogue-driven sequences. Additionally, there are also French and Spanish  stereo dubs (none of the audio tracks cannot be switched on the fly) and optional subtitles in English or Spanish.The actual extras are a mixed bag. We do get two commentaries like we did for ""X2"", but unfortunately both the director/writer and producer commentaries aren't substantial. We get a few production details but no real dirt on what happened behind the scenes nor any interesting production anecdotes, just congratulatory for the most part. There are also 21 deleted/extended scenes and 3 alternate endings (in anamorphic widescreen with Dolby Digital 5.1 audio) with optional commentary. Those are fun to see, but easy to see why most of them were cut/changed in the first place. We also get the teaser and theatrical trailers for ""X3"" as well as some trailers for other Marvel films, and that's it. Those looking for quality extras along the lines of ""X2"" should wait for the inevitable 2-disc double-dip set.In a nice touch on the DVD engineers' part, you can skip the trailers and anti-piracy trailer with the menu button and go straight to the menu selection (you can either ""Join the Brotherhood"" or ""Take A Stand""). The menus are animated with 5.1 surround sound, and the movie itself is divided into 24 chapters. The disc is packaged in a regular Amaray keep case with a chapter insert (provided you buy a new copy and not a used one) and a mail-in DVD rebate for this movie and other Fox titles.If you liked this movie and want to buy it, the current edition out now has a stellar transfer and an okay array of extras. For the die-hard fans, better save the money and wait for the inevitable 2-disc edition (which will probably be released to coincide with the theatrical release of ""Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer"").",3,Okay movie but great DVD transfer,1174089600,"03 17, 2007",2007,4223,"['expected', 'worse', 'case', 'scenario', 'when', 'heard', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'was', 'taking', 'reins', 'X-Men', 'franchise', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'bolted', 'helm', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'end', 'product', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'competently', 'directed', 'Ratner', 'stated', 'wanted', 'maintain', 'Singer', 'overall', 'vision', 'done', 'terms', 'look', 'feel', 'film', 'well-acted', 'action', 'sequences', 'CGI', 'are', 'very', 'well-done', 'score', 'John', 'Powell', 'superb', 'heroic', 'emotional', 'weight', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'soundtrack', '.But', 'are', 'bad', 'sections', 'away', 'movie', 'quality', 'script', 'rushed', 'not', 'surprising', 'considering', 'Fox', 'greenlighted', 'quickly', 'order', 'make', 'May', '26', 'date', 'never', 'surface', 'complex', 'moral', 'ethical', 'issues', 'presented', 'storyline', 'script', 'also', 'just', 'away', 'minor', 'characters', 'such', 'Mystique', 'Cyclops', 'favor', 'new', 'ones', 'as', 'well', 'giving', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'demands', 'more', 'screentime', 'giving', 'proper', 'send-off', 'lastly', 'part', 'fault', 'film', 'length', 'sans', 'ending', 'credits', 'film', 'just', 'hour', 'half', 'long', 'just', ""n't"", 'enough', 'time', 'give', 'main', 'characters', 'depth', 'storylines', 'breathing', 'room', 'flaws', 'X-Men', 'Last', 'Stand', 'entertaining', 'worth', 'revisiting', 'provided', 'expectations', 'are', 'sufficiently', 'lowered', 'first', 'film.The', 'movie', 'available', 'three', 'flavors', 'single-disc', 'full-screen', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'editions', 'deluxe', 'edition', 'single-disc', 'widescreen', 'edition', '100', 'page', 'comic', 'book', 'Blu-ray', 'edition.The', 'single-disc', 'edition', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'terms', 'transfer', 'quality', '2.40:1', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'par', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'spotless', 'beautiful', 'black', 'levels', 'rich', 'colors', 'wonderfully-film', 'start', 'finish', 'audio', 'just', 'stupendous', 'first', 'two', 'demonstration', 'quality', 'DVD', 'release', 'audio', 'was', 'mastered', 'Mi', 'Casa', 'Multimedia', 'guys', 'who', 'also', 'mastered', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'DVDs', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'EX', 'DTS', '6.1', 'ES', 'track', 'will', 'give', 'surround', 'system', 'thorough', 'workout', 'particularly', 'Danger', 'Room', 'Sequence', 'finale', 'Alcatraz', 'Prison', 'track', 'also', 'subtle', 'completely', 'viewer', 'even', 'dialogue-driven', 'sequences', 'Additionally', 'are', 'also', 'French', 'Spanish', 'stereo', 'dubs', 'none', 'audio', 'tracks', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'switched', 'fly', 'optional', 'subtitles', 'English', 'Spanish.The', 'actual', 'extras', 'are', 'mixed', 'bag', 'do', 'get', 'two', 'commentaries', 'did', 'X2', 'unfortunately', 'director/writer', 'producer', 'commentaries', 'are', ""n't"", 'substantial', 'get', 'few', 'production', 'details', 'real', 'dirt', 'what', 'happened', 'scenes', 'interesting', 'production', 'anecdotes', 'just', 'congratulatory', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'also', '21', 'deleted/extended', 'scenes', '3', 'alternate', 'endings', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'audio', 'optional', 'commentary', 'are', 'fun', 'see', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'most', 'were', 'cut/changed', 'first', 'place', 'also', 'get', 'teaser', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'X3', 'as', 'well', 'trailers', 'other', 'Marvel', 'films', 'looking', 'quality', 'extras', 'lines', 'X2', 'should', 'wait', 'inevitable', '2-disc', 'double-dip', 'set.In', 'nice', 'touch', 'DVD', 'engineers', 'part', 'can', 'skip', 'trailers', 'anti-piracy', 'trailer', 'menu', 'button', 'go', 'straight', 'menu', 'selection', 'can', 'either', 'Join', 'Brotherhood', 'Take', 'Stand', 'menus', 'are', 'animated', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'movie', 'divided', '24', 'chapters', 'disc', 'packaged', 'regular', 'Amaray', 'keep', 'case', 'chapter', 'insert', 'provided', 'buy', 'new', 'copy', 'not', 'used', 'one', 'mail-in', 'DVD', 'rebate', 'movie', 'other', 'Fox', 'titles.If', 'liked', 'movie', 'want', 'buy', 'current', 'edition', 'out', 'now', 'stellar', 'transfer', 'okay', 'array', 'extras', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'better', 'save', 'money', 'wait', 'inevitable', '2-disc', 'edition', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'released', 'coincide', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Fantastic', '4', 'Rise', 'Silver', 'Surfer']",N/A

The reason is simple: pretty much all the reviews I read said it was awful. I should have known better than to pay too much attention to them!I ended up going to watch ""X-Men - The Last Stand"" this morning, because my sister wanted to see it. I had a very welcomed surprise. This movie is probably the best in the series, at least so far. Of course, you shouldn't expect too much: this is a movie designed merely for entertainment purposes, and it is quite far from being a classic or anything similar to that. That having been said, it engages the audience easily, and it entertains.This movie doesn't pretend to be more than what it is: a blockbuster with lots of action and not too much character development. However, that is all right in my book, at least in some of the films I watch. Yes, ""X-Men - The Last Stand"" could have been better, but it is nonetheless a film you will probably like, specially if you are already a fan of the series.The inspiration for the plot is taken from the ""X-men"" comics, even though the story has been substantially modified. In a nutshell, a cure to treat mutations has been found, and mutants react differently to that discovery. The Brotherhood, a group of mutants whose leader is Magneto (Ian McKellen), plans to destroy the cure. The X-Men, led by Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), think that every mutant should be able to choose without pressures whether to remain one or not. In Prof. Charles Xavier's words ""Since the dawn of existence, there have always been moments when the course of history shifted. Such a turning point is upon us now"" (...) ""I do not know if victory is possible. I only know that great sacrifice will be required. And because the fate of many will depend on a few, we must make the last stand"".There is also a secondary plot: Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), an X-Men that died in the second film of the series in order to save her teammates, is reborn, but as someone different, more powerful, and much more dangerous. Jean is now her alterego, Phoenix, a force that cannot be controlled, and that might well wreak havoc on the world. But is there any way of saving her? And will Professor Xavier, Scott (James Marsden), Logan (Hugh Jackman) and Storm (Hally Berry) find it, before it is too late?On the whole, I think that you will like this film a lot, if you are already a fan of the series. It is more of the same, only a little better. In case you haven't watched the previous movies, give them a try before watching ""X-Men - The Last Stand"", because then you will understand better what is happening in this film. Of course, recommended :)Belen AlcatPS1: Don't leave the cinema as soon as the movie finishes, as there is a little and very surprising scene just after the credits finish rolling up. You will have to wait a few extra minutes, but believe me, it is worth it!PS2: There are new additions to the X-men, the most noteworthy being Beast, that is Dr. Hank Mcoy (played by Kelsey Grammer).",4,"It is more of the same, only a little better...",1148774400,"05 28, 2006",2006,3072,"['watched', 'previous', 'two', 'movies', 'X-men', 'series', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'one', 'reason', 'simple', 'pretty', 'much', 'reviews', 'read', 'said', 'was', 'awful', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'better', 'pay', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'ended', 'up', 'going', 'watch', 'X-Men', 'Last', 'Stand', 'morning', 'sister', 'wanted', 'see', 'had', 'very', 'welcomed', 'surprise', 'movie', 'probably', 'best', 'series', 'least', 'so', 'far', 'course', 'should', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'designed', 'merely', 'entertainment', 'purposes', 'quite', 'far', 'being', 'classic', 'anything', 'similar', 'having', 'been', 'said', 'audience', 'easily', 'entertains.This', 'movie', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'more', 'what', 'blockbuster', 'lots', 'action', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'character', 'development', 'However', 'right', 'book', 'least', 'films', 'watch', 'Yes', 'X-Men', 'Last', 'Stand', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'nonetheless', 'film', 'will', 'probably', 'like', 'specially', 'are', 'already', 'fan', 'series.The', 'inspiration', 'plot', 'taken', 'X-men', 'comics', 'even', 'story', 'been', 'substantially', 'modified', 'nutshell', 'cure', 'treat', 'mutations', 'been', 'found', 'mutants', 'react', 'differently', 'discovery', 'Brotherhood', 'group', 'mutants', 'leader', 'Magneto', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'destroy', 'cure', 'X-Men', 'led', 'Professor', 'Charles', 'Xavier', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'think', 'mutant', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'choose', 'pressures', 'remain', 'one', 'not', 'Prof.', 'Charles', 'Xavier', 'words', 'dawn', 'existence', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'moments', 'when', 'course', 'history', 'shifted', 'turning', 'point', 'now', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'victory', 'possible', 'only', 'know', 'great', 'sacrifice', 'will', 'be', 'required', 'fate', 'many', 'will', 'depend', 'few', 'must', 'make', 'last', 'stand', 'also', 'secondary', 'plot', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'X-Men', 'died', 'second', 'film', 'series', 'order', 'save', 'teammates', 'reborn', 'someone', 'different', 'more', 'powerful', 'much', 'more', 'dangerous', 'Jean', 'now', 'alterego', 'Phoenix', 'force', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'controlled', 'might', 'well', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'world', 'there', 'way', 'saving', 'will', 'Professor', 'Xavier', 'Scott', 'James', 'Marsden', 'Logan', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Storm', 'Hally', 'Berry', 'find', 'too', 'late', 'whole', 'think', 'will', 'like', 'film', 'lot', 'are', 'already', 'fan', 'series', 'more', 'same', 'only', 'little', 'better', 'case', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'previous', 'movies', 'give', 'try', 'watching', 'X-Men', 'Last', 'Stand', 'then', 'will', 'understand', 'better', 'what', 'happening', 'film', 'course', 'recommended', 'Belen', 'AlcatPS1', 'Do', ""n't"", 'leave', 'cinema', 'as', 'soon', 'movie', 'finishes', 'little', 'very', 'surprising', 'scene', 'just', 'credits', 'finish', 'rolling', 'up', 'will', 'have', 'wait', 'few', 'extra', 'minutes', 'believe', 'PS2', 'are', 'new', 'additions', 'X-men', 'most', 'noteworthy', 'being', 'Beast', 'Dr.', 'Hank', 'Mcoy', 'played', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer']",N/A

Or giving in to your star so she gets a bigger role, and still gives an uninspired performance? Rumour has it, Halle Berry was refusing to come back and play Storm, because she didn't have a lot of screen time in the first two movies. So we get more of her, and a lot less of Mystique, who could have had a big storyline, but that was dropped.Also Cyclops (James Marsden) made the mistake of signing on to be in Superman Returns as well, and his role is greatly reduced, to a couple of scenes, and a gravestone. He gets killed by the love of his life (boy, that must have sucked), and guess what? His death happens off screen.And what was the sense in bringing back Famke Jansen? She doesn't do much apart from stand around and look menacing, but I suppose being brought back from the dead will do that to anyone. How exactly did she manage to come back? The character is really underdeveloped. She stands around in the background for most of the movie, until she decides to ""annihilate"" something or someone, just for the special effect.The special effects were alright, trying to make up for what was a serious lack of plot. The special effects used in the beginning of the film, where we see what happens 20 years earlier (which bore no relation to the rest of the film at all), was wasted. They attempted to make Patrick Stewart & Ian McKellen 20 years younger. They amazingly failed on Patrick - he looked no different whatsoever. And Ian was given brown hair. And their faces were obviously edited and smoothed out compared to the other actors in the scene. How much money is thrown at these kinda ageing things per second?Then there was the obvious referencing other movies. (Or stealing scenes if you prefer.) When the film properly starts, it's nearly a direct steal from the Terminator films. The scene between IceMan and FireGuy towards the end? Did anyone else notice it was the same as the two wands clashing between Harry & Voldemort? Then at the end, it looked very similar to the final scene in Carrie, with Famke as Carrie. The bullet stopping scenes is referencing Matrix Reloaded? Or one of those films.And the point in Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut is? The guy cannot act. When will people start realising this! The 'fat' suit he was wearing was meant to make him look like a big muscle man, but he ended up looking like a sumo wrestler gone wrong.Anna Paquin's role as Rogue is greatly reduced, to practically being non-existent. Wasn't she the main part of the first film? Was it worth her time turning up for filming? Did she use her mutant powers once during the film? No.I was really disappointed in this film, and had to keep pausing it as I couldn't remember what happened in the first two movies. But I remember really liking the first one. But this seemed like CGI/action scene one after the other. And Xavier is killed. I kept expecting him to make another appearance, to come back. Well, if they brought back Famke Jansen ...!!!Hopefully, this is the last, disappointing finale to the X-Men trilogy. Although, judging by the ending, they're hoping for another. Zzz. Lets hope not! If you're going to name the movie ""The Last Stand"" don't imply that something else is going to happen at the end!This film should never have been made. If it wasn't for Wolverine, I probably would have given this film less stars. If Mystique had stayed and been given a bigger role, the film would have got more stars. I understand this review had been one big rant. But watch the movie and you'll understand why it should have never been made.Actually don't watch the movie. Read the one/two star reviews for it.

Maybe it was because my expectations were lowered, but I found this last X-men installment to be a highly enjoyable film. As one who never read the comics and was simply looking to be entertained with some fast-paced action and cool mutant powers, I got what I wanted along with a healthy dose of the darkness that made the previous two X-men so compelling.As others have mentioned, the one thing lacking in this movie was the character development. Halle Berry as Storm seems to get much more screen time than usual to do basically nothing. I really wanted to see some more of Rogue, and Angel could have been a much more interesting character with more attention. But I guess they figured we knew most of the characters pretty well from the previous films, and were focusing more on wrapping up the story.

Newman,"[0, 0]",I have seen all the movies that have been put out by Marvel over the last 6 years or so and was never a big fan of the X-Men films though the first 2 were passable.  This movie has way too many characters in it!  Some of the characters are pathetic looking such as the Juggernaut and The Beast (who looks and sounds like they dyed a gorilla costume from the Planet of the Apes movies).  They waited to the last installment to introduce The Beast and the Angel who were original X-Men in the comics (X-Men was never a popular title until they changed the line-up adding Wolverine and Storm along with others).There is just too much going on for the viewer to grasp the entire plot unless you were intricately familiar with the comic stories.  The scene where Magneto rips and moves a large section of the Golden Gate Bridge was ridiculous.  The movie seemed to also rip off the humans being disolved into a sand-like substance by The Phoenix from the War of the Worlds movie (sans the clothes that remain after they disolve).The last scene of the movie sets it up for a sequel though I don't know if my head can stand another two hours of overdone special effects with too many characters (as much as the Fantastic Four was panned it was a lot easier to watch with only four heroes and one villian to focus on)!,3,Better Than the Hulk but not as Good as the Fantastic Four,1167177600,"12 27, 2006",2006,1310,"['have', 'seen', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'out', 'Marvel', 'last', '6', 'years', 'so', 'was', 'never', 'big', 'fan', 'X-Men', 'films', 'first', '2', 'were', 'passable', 'movie', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'characters', 'are', 'pathetic', 'looking', 'such', 'Juggernaut', 'Beast', 'who', 'dyed', 'gorilla', 'costume', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'movies', 'waited', 'last', 'installment', 'introduce', 'Beast', 'Angel', 'who', 'were', 'original', 'X-Men', 'comics', 'X-Men', 'was', 'never', 'popular', 'title', 'changed', 'line-up', 'adding', 'Wolverine', 'Storm', 'others', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'viewer', 'grasp', 'entire', 'plot', 'were', 'intricately', 'familiar', 'comic', 'stories', 'scene', 'where', 'Magneto', 'rips', 'large', 'section', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'movie', 'seemed', 'also', 'rip', 'off', 'humans', 'being', 'disolved', 'sand-like', 'substance', 'Phoenix', 'War', 'Worlds', 'movie', 'clothes', 'remain', 'disolve', '.The', 'last', 'scene', 'movie', 'up', 'sequel', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'head', 'can', 'stand', 'two', 'hours', 'overdone', 'special', 'effects', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'as', 'much', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'was', 'panned', 'was', 'lot', 'easier', 'watch', 'only', 'four', 'heroes', 'one', 'villian', 'focus']",N/A

Let me just say this was a great entertaining movie with some script complications but I enjoyed X-Men: The Last Stand. It wasnt the best out of the three...X2 being the best. It would of been better if it was just X-Men 3. It left it open for a 4th & 5th. The action scenes were great especially the whole bit with Jean at her house. I liked the scene in the beginning where Wolverine lights his cigar off a burning car...just great.  So the story goes that there is a mutant named Leech played by Cameron Bright  who is a special kind of mutant. He has the ability to revert the mutant gene. So the head honchos jump on this as soon as possible. Jean Grey played by the beautiful Famke Janssen has returned from her watery grave with a bit of a problem. Her other persona Phoenix has come out to play which makes even more things complicated. Magneto played by the always great Ian McKellan joins together his fellow mutants along with Pyro played by Aaron Stanford , Juggernaut played by Vinnie Jones  (""I'm the Juggernaut bitch!"") and so on to go forth and try to stop the humans from trying to turn the mutants into...well...humans and so Wolverine played by the awesome Hugh Jackman and the other X-Men band together to fight or...make a stand.

This was of course a cruel publicity stunt, as the X-Men had a long history prior to that comic, but it gave kids like me the feeling that I was at the beginning of something special.  The X-Men movies evoke the same feeling of witnessing a mythology in the making.Essentially, mutants are the next evolution of humanity.  Their powers run from the straightforward (Cyclops shoots rays out of his eyes) to the extreme (Storm can control the weather, Professor Xavier is the most powerful psychic on the planet).  Unsurprisingly, the rest of us normal folks are not okay with this and struggle to deal with the burgeoning social, economic, and political issues that arise when a percentage of the population can blow up government buildings by sneezing.In X-Men: The Last Stand, the wheelchair bound Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stuart) leads a school of students dedicated to teaching and refining their powers.  He also runs what amounts to an anti-terrorist organization of super mutants.  They're job is to protect mutant interests, stop other mutants from running amok, and save the world.  The group included Jean Grey (the delicious Famke Janssen), her lover Scott Summers AKA Cyclops (James Marsden), Ororo Munroe AKA Storm (Halle Berry, a little less wooden this time around but not much), and Logan AKA Wolverine (Hugh Jackman, for the ladies) who needs no introduction. With the supposed death of Jean and the disappearance of Cyclops, it's up to Storm and Wolverine to lead a new farm team of mutants into battle.  These newbies include fresh-faced Marie AKA Rogue (Anna Paquin) who can drain powers, Kitty Pride AKA Shadowcat (Ellen Page) who can phase through walls, Peter Rasputin AKA Colossus (the hulking Daniel Cudmore) who can transform himself into living steel, and Marie's boyfriend Bobby Drake AKA Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) who can...well, you can probably guess.On the other side of the spectrum are the terrorists themselves, the Brotherhood of Mutants, led by the charismatic Eric Lensherr AKA Magneto (Ian McKellen, whose very presence elevates the film to high art), master of magnetism.  His minions include shape shifting Raven Darkholme AKA Mystique (Rebecca Romjin) and ex-Xavier student John Allerdyce AKA Pyro (Aaron Stanford). New recruits to the Brotherhood include Callisto (Dania Ramirez), Cain Marko AKA Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), Multiple Man (Eric Dane), and a bunch of other mutants known as the Morlocks...at least, that's what they're called in the comics.The two opposing mutant groups are galvanized by the discovery of a ""cure"" by the Worthington foundation for mutations.  This anti-mutant serum removes all superpowers, making mutants normal people.  Some people see this cure as salvation, like Rogue, who cannot touch anyone for long without killing them.  Others see it as a deadly threat to their rights to exist, especially after Magneto discovers that human agents carry weapons loaded with the serum in lieu of bullets. Straddling the world of politics and mutant rights is Dr. Hank McCoy AKA Beast (Kelsey Grammer) and long-time friend of Xavier.At the same time, the supposedly deceased Jean Grey has returned and is more powerful than ever. Taking on the persona of Phoenix, she slowly tears up the terrain and the people who love her, eventually falling in with Magneto's Brotherhood.  Phoenix becomes Magneto's secret weapon in an attack on the Worthington facility in Alcatraz.  Yes, that Alcatraz.  Since the serum is created from a single mutant named Jimmy AKA Leech (Cameron Bright), eliminating the boy will effectively stop the program.What ensues is a brute force battle over the San Francisco Bridge as the Brotherhood of Mutants, Xavier's School for the Gifted, and the military (armed with plastic weapons this go round against Magneto's powers; see, humans CAN learn!) duke it out.The good news is that this is the most geeky of the X-Men films, less interested in the mutants making sense for and more concerned with mutants showing off their powers.  Thus we get to see the Fastball Special: Colossus picks up Wolverine and hurls him at opponents.  We finally have Beast doing what he does best, quoting scholarly literature as he beats bad guys up with his feet.  And Storm stops futzing around and electrocutes people. Wolverine smokes cigars and acts like a tough guy. There's even the tease of a Sentinel fight.The Last Stand isn't without a sense of humor. A terrified mother, witnessing mutant powers in full swing, locks the doors on her car. Wolverine, faced with a bad guy who keeps regenerating, finally kicks him in the groin. And Juggernaut quotes the Internet (fans will know what I'm talking about).The bad news is that The Last Stand is essentially two movies collapsed into one.  Phoenix's resurrection and the anti-mutant serum seem to have nothing to do with each other.  Phoenix's presence is unnecessary, and when she finally unleashes her full destructive might, it seems anticlimactic.  Stewart and McKellen aside, the other actors struggle with their lines, especially Berry and Janssen.It feels like this third installment of the trilogy was forced to wrap-up the details of the second film, but midway in production went through a change in leadership so that the new director put his own spin on the movie, creating a schizophrenic quality. Oh wait, that's exactly what happened! Bryan Singer was originally helming this film, and Brett Ratner took over in his stead.  It shows.X-Men's not a deep film, though its premise could be applied to everything from the war on terror to racism to gay rights.  Instead, it opts to be a comic book movie, no more or less than the comic itself: lots of superpowers, a lot of brawling, and snippy asides.  If anything, this third movie is truer to the comics than the first two.  If you need further proof, stay through the end of the credits.",4,True to the spirit of the comics,1149379200,"06 4, 2006",2006,5990,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'X-Men', 'back', 'when', 'restarted',

The X-Men must stop Magneto before he causes too much damage, but a former ally has been raised from the ashes of her former self, and she may be the deciding factor in this war.This X-Men movie is the best yet.

1012490,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B000HCO83G,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[3, 7]","It is downright eerie to see how interconnected the seemingly autonomous projects, Superman Returns and X-Men: The Last Stand, are with each other. For example, Brett Ratner, director of the third and possibly final installment in the X-Men series, was originally attached to resurrect the once venerable DC Comic superhero film franchise, which, in light of both the exasperating Superman III and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, unquestionably the worst installment in the series, was in serious need of revival, with Superman Returns now helmed by Bryan Singer, director of the first two X-Men movies. Creative differences with Warner Brother executives however forced Ratner from the project. Ratner was then replaced with McG, director of the fortuitously unfunny Charlie's Angels film series, who reportedly was hired as a ploy to lure Michael Bay to the project. It ultimately failed when Bay asked for too much in back-end deals. In accepting the position of director for Superman Returns, Singer made live-long enemies with studio executives at 20th Century Fox. Not only did he dump the third X-Men movie with little if any advance notice to the studio, he brought along with him cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel, composer/editor John Ottman, production designer Guy Dyas, and writers Dan Harris and Michael Dougherty, all of whom collaborated with Singer on the X2: X-Men United, draining the 20th Century Fox of some creative talent for the next installment at an inopportune time, the studio having just stacked out a claim for a Memorial Day release in 2006.The story for X-Men: The Last Stand is easily the least memorable in the comic book trilogy. In addition it is far less consistent in terms of flow then the previous two entries. But then again given how Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris, two of the three screenwriters for X2: X-Men United, bailed on this project in order to work on director Bryan Singer's Superman project over at Warner Brothers it does not come as a complete surprise. The two screenwriters who replaced them lacked sufficient credentials to fill the void Harris and Dougherty left behind. Simon Kinberg wrote the screenplay for the embarrassing follow-up to the Vin Diesel blockbuster, xXx2: State of the Union, and Mr. & Mrs. Smith while Zak Penn's sole writing credit was for Elektra. Fans of both the comic book as well as the cartoon series the X-Men films were based on will be sorely disappointed with how the Phoenix saga is portrayed onscreen particularly after the anticipation that was built up following the titillating conclusion to the first sequel in which an image of a fiery Phoenix can be barely made out from below the waters. The two variant plot lines - the mutant cure (based on Joss Whedon's Astonishing X-Men storyline) and the Phoenix saga - do not gel well together, belittling rather then complimenting each other. Also there are specific plot elements in the script that simply do not work at all. For example, the subplot between Angel, the boy with the bird-like wings, and his father, Warren Worthington, the man behind the mutant `cure', is a complete waste. Nothing is done in term of advancing the plot. In fact the character of Angel itself makes only three appearances throughout the movie, none of which are of any significance with the only exception being at the very end. And what is the point of hinting at a supposed love triangle between Kitty Pryde, Iceman, and Rogue when nothing comes about of it? Outside of being a close friend nothing occurs between Kitty and Iceman that would suggest an impending romantic relationship. Rogue is barely seen as it is in the film so her transformation from having powers to being `cured' of her mutant powers which have been nothing but a curse to her has no emotional impact on the audience.Hugh Jackman returns in top action form as was to be expected in the role of Wolverine. However unlike the previous installments no advancement is made in terms of Wolverine's character development. The audience gains no further insight into his past or the depth of his mind. This is a disappointment to say the least but had more time been devoted toward the script then something may have developed in some form or another. This will likely be expanded upon however in the subsequent spin-off soon to follow. Regretfully Academy Award-winner (it was handed to her because the NAACP complained) Halle Berry returns as Storm. Her role was expanded significantly (or else she would not have reprised the role in the third installment in the film series) but her vapid performance as the newly appointed leader of the X-Men leaves something greatly to be desired. Her character's mutant powers are used to their full potential but besides that it was a critical mistake for Brett Ratner to have expanded her role in the film. Berry could have easily been replaced and no one would have noticed or complained. And while no comic book character truly dies (something both Superman and Elektra for example can attest to) certain send-offs in this film, Cyclops's off-screen expulsion in particular, were a tad dispiriting.Sir Ian McKellen who earlier this summer appeared alongside Tom Hanks in the Ron Howard drama The Da Vinci Code returns to the role of Magneto/Eric Lehnsherr in top form which frankly is hardly a surprise given his experienced acting career. It is the final climatic scene in the film in which Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants and the X-Men face off on Alcatraz Island that fully demonstrates the cruel irony of Magneto's development in the X-Men film series. Standing high above the masses of `pawns' he sends in first against the humans guarding Alcatraz Island, relentlessly cut-down with guns loaded with the `cure', Magneto has become the very thing he hated most, as tyrannical a dictator as Adolf Hitler ever was. And while the film's conclusion in which a now cured Magneto is seen in the park playing a game of chess alone is a tad precipitous and headlong, it fits perfectly with the X-Men mythology. In the comic book series Magneto and his immediate family were persecuted for their Jewish heritage by the Nazis, shot and then buried in a mass grave. He alone survived because he unconsciously used his magnetic powers to prevent the bullet from killing him. While it is unlikely we will know the definitive answer to whether Magneto was `cured' of his mutant powers or not, it is certainly not out the question that he indeed used his magnetic powers, consciously or not, to prevent the needle from delivering the cure into his body.Kelsey Grammer perfectly translates the mutant character Beast from the comic book and cartoon series to the silver screen, from his appearance to his mannerisms and even down to his famous tagline, ""My stars and garters"". Fans will be pleased to say the least about it.There was so much potential, at least from a fanboy aspect, for Kitty Pryde (one of the few prominent Jewish superheroes not to mention her extraordinary high IQ) that even her translation from a mere background character to a supporting role is a bit of a disappointment. Ellen Page's performance however is delightful regardless the irrelevant love-triangle the writers involve her in.As for Juggernaut, played by British football player-turned actor Vinnie Jones, nothing is mention in the way of his character being related to Professor Charles Xavier. In the comic book series he was the stepbrother of Professor X and his helmet which is dramatically different from the one he wears in the film was created to block out telekenetic powers such as his stepbrother's so noone could read his mind or manipulate him. The only highlight may be the cheap one-liner he throws at Kitty Pyrde near the end of the film, ""Don't you know who I am? I'm the Juggernaut, bitch!"" This of course is a passing reference to the internet short film `The Juggernaut Bitch' but unless you aware of what they are referring to, it just comes off as being awkward and unnecessary.And while it may be a mystery for some, the absence of Nightcrawler from the picture should not come as a surprise to audience members who have played the X-Men: The Last Stand companion video game.Overall, the third and quite conceivably the final chapter in the epic X-Men saga (spin-off projects however are being developed by 20th Century Fox for individual mutants including Wolverine, Magneto, and even Mystique) was not the best we could have hope for but neither was it as cataclysmic a disaster as some hardcore fans predicted it would be. Firmly lacking the quintessential elements of continuity and profundity in the areas of character development and story enhancement, X3 never really rises above the measure of a pure adrenaline-fueled action popcorn flick which needless to say is precisely what the domestic box office needs more of. It won't please everyone but neither is it meant to. Sure, it goes a little over the top at times and it is noticeable that more forethought was placed into carefully orchestrating particular action sequences (for example, the Golden Gate Bridge sequence) then crucial elements of the script which were more worthy of attention. That said however the action sequences are where the film and more importantly director Brett Ratner truly shine. The battle scene near the beginning of the film, the one in which fans get to briefly see the Danger Room as well as a quick shot of a Sentinel, and the one at the end seem to mirror each other perfectly, creating a sort of symmetry which works to great effect. There's the brilliantly choreographed fight sequence between Wolverine and other mutants through a forest, moments with the Phoenix, and so much more that to further elaborate would be to spoil it. Beyond that X3's dilemmas are staggering. This is not however director Brett Ratner's fault mind you. Let's face it, X2: X-Men United with the exception of the rather haphazard subtitle is one of the best comic book feature film adaptations in recent memory, if not of all time, albeit far behind the genius of Spider-Man 2. X2 was a tremendously difficult act to follow whether it was Brett Ratner or even if Bryan Singer himself had returned to the helm. Like Return of the Jedi after the Empire Strikes Back, the second film had received such critical and public acclaim that expectations were set ridiculously high for the follow up. In other words someone was bound to be disappointed no matter who directed it. In addition kudos should be given to director Brett Ratner for putting together a practically acceptable if not often inconsistent superhero film in the short amount of time, far less then any other director in the same situation at a different production studio. Singer's absence is noticeable, no doubt about it. The first two films were far more sincere in nature while Ratner's is more off-balanced. But rather then attempt to duplicate Singer's directorial style Ratner instead chose to put his own spin on the X-Men franchise which whether you agree with it or not is true to his filmmaking abilities. While X-Men: The Last Stand marks a significant step backward for the superhero film franchise, it is at least a half-way decent action flick, something of which American movie audiences have been deprived of for some time now. Had director Brett Ratner been given more time in which to put together the production, he could have easily produced a stirring final chapter in the X-Men saga but sadly it does not happen this time around.",4,The Moose Hole - The Last Stand of the X-Men,1152835200,"07 14, 2006",2006,11530,"['downright', 'eerie', 'see', 'how', 'interconnected', 'seemingly', 'autonomous', 'projects', 'Superman',

1012493,AGCJDJH2CTDD9,B000HCO83G,Mike Zimmerman,"[0, 2]","The death of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) has taken a toll on Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Scott Summers/Cyclops (James Marsden). Things change, however, when she is revealed to be alive in the same ocean she drowned in. However, when Scott rescues her, he dies, and Wolverine and Ororo Monroe/Storm (Halle Berry) take Jean and keep her in a rejuvenation center. However, Grey winds up acting homicidal and winds up killing everything and everyone, including Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart). Magneto (Ian McKellan) kidnaps her, along with other mutants. Matters are further complicated when a ""cure"" to eradicate mutant DNA surfaces, and what follows is a war between the good mutants and the bad mutants.Even before there was a ""Spider-Man,"" the most famous comic book film of the millennium was ""X-Men."" Starring big-named heavyweights (Halle Berry, Ian McKellan, and Patrick Stewart) and directed by Bryan Singer (""The Usual Suspects""), both ""X-Men"" movies were box office gold. Not to mention did it make Aussie hunk Hugh Jackman a major star. Bad news came in 2005 when Bryan Singer ditched out of his latest opus to do ""Superman Returns."" To add more fuel to the fire, comic book fanboy Brett Ratner (any Chris Tucker movies and ""After the Sunset"") would be asked to direct it. And here we are, in 2006.Despite new direction, ""The Last Stand"" remains the same concoction that Bryan Singer developed. As with any new installment, the movie features brand new mutants: Angel (Ben Foster), Beast (Kelsey Grammar), Callisto (Dania Ramirez), Colossus (Daniel Cudmore), Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), Leech (Cameron Bright), Multiple Man (Eric Dane), and Siryn (Shauna Kain). Of course, too much is too much, and with the movie clocking in at 105 minutes (just as in the original), Ratner doesn't seem to develop some of these characters, especially Angel and Kitty Pride (the latter develops a ""bond"" with Bobby Drake, which isn't explained if he really loves her or not).Ratner picks the movie back up to speed when the finale kicks off. Of course, he's going for an all-mutant free-for-all, but slick camera work and tense music from composer John Powell keeps things in perspective. He also has a tendency to end the movie on a bittersweet note, killing off a couple of mutants from all installments. However, the movie doesn't have the gravitas as the last two installments, and some of the more sentimental scenes come off rather fake. I'm told the ""X-Men"" comic books had a soap opera-style story, but the rancid, melodramatic scenes (including one between Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry) are a bit of a doozy to sit through.I still enjoyed the cast, however. Once again, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellan, and Patrick Stewart are in top form. Halle Berry manages to pull a bravura performance after stinking up 2004's ""Catwoman"" (good thing she has a sense of humor about that one). And you haven't lived until you've seen Vinnie Jones (Juggernaut) and Ellen Page (Kitty Pride) on screen.Too bad for formerly interesting side actors. Famke Janssen has a tendency to overact (given, she has done ""nip/tuck"") instead of offering Jean Grey some bits of genuine pathos, even if she went evil. Scenes between Shawn Ashmore (looking to join Paul Walker into the ""School of Keanu Reeves Wannabes"") and Anna Paquin/Ellen Page are flat and unfocused. And Ben Foster's Angel doesn't get deserved screen time, because his backstory is very interesting out of the bunch.Regardless, Brett Ratner does the unthinkable and makes the plothole-ridden package come full circle. It's not gonna win any awards, but then again, the last two installments clearly weren't Oscar contenders.

It's a comic about tolerance, rejection, prejudice, evolution, segregation, discrimination and the perennial search for acceptance.Director Bryan Singer brilliantly accomplished to expose all the complex paradoxes, problems and personal issues the mutants were suffering because of the fear the ""normal"" human beings felt for them. Now, in Brett Ratner's hands, X-3 doesn't stop to examine so many moral dilemmas and jumps straight into action. His execution is more crude and superficial, but more exciting.Once again we find the mutants in the middle of a conflict: just when it seemed they were feeling accepted in the world, a millionaire discovers a vaccine capable of remove the X gene. Some mutants take the news with joy. Others, of course, aren't as pleased.On one side, Professor Xavier and his pupils try to discuss the subject in a civilized and rational way. On the other side, Magneto sees this discovery as a new threat to extinguish all mutants from the planet and convinced with this idea he decides to gather an army that will fight those who want to anihilate the mutants. A confrontation between the X Men and Magneto's army is unavoidable.X-3 is definitely more action-packed than its predecessors, but it also lacks the character development the first two movies carefully outlined to make us care about these people and their conflicts.But balancing with a sure hand the action sequences, Ratner has created a very entertaining ending to this trilogy, making risky decisions like killing main characters and overwhelming us with so many new mutants that we don't have enough time to get to know them as well as the old characters.A word of advice: stay until the very end of the credits. There's a small scene that will make you wonder if indeed this is the X Men last battle.

Mutants and humans are living in relative harmony, with Dr. Hank McCoy (Kelsey Grammar), aka Beast, serving as Secretary of Mutant Affairs to a sympathetic U.S. President. The peace is shattered when a pharmaceutical company announces that it can produce a ""cure"" for the mutant-X gene, allowing Mutants to become normal homo sapiens if they so choose. The Mutant community is divided over whether this is a good thing, and assurances are given that the ""cure"" is entirely voluntary. Meanwhile, Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) is discovered alive but no longer able to suppress the violence of her powers. Magneto (Ian McKellan) uses the ""cure"" controversy to incite Mutants against humans and plans to destroy the source of the drug.""X-Men: The Last Stand"" incorporates some elements from the X-Men comic that we haven't' seen before in the movies, such as the Danger Room and the Dark Phoenix storyline. New characters are Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), Angel (Ben Foster), and Beast. Beast comes off pretty well. He, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), and Magneto are the most developed characters, leaving the others to come and go in the periphery. There is too little of Mystique (Rebecca Romijn), as always. The debate over whether or not Mutants should take the ""cure"" is interesting. But the film's view of using the ""cure"" as a weapon is morally confused. Perhaps that is deliberate, but it's unsatisfying. I rate ""X3"" the same as the previous films in terms of story, characters, and action. But this film's themes are a little more contentious.The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006 single disc): There are 24 deleted scenes available with optional commentary by director Brett Ratner and writers Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn. There are 2 trailers for X3, Trailer A (1  min) and Trailer B (2  min), along with trailers for other films. There are 2 audio commentaries. The first audio commentary by director Brett Ratner and writers Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn is conversational and often joking. It takes us through the story with some technical details and comments on structure. The 2nd audio commentary by producers Avi Arad, Lauren Shuler Donner, and Ralph Winter is more informative, addressing visual effects, locations, tone, story, actors, elements from the comic books, and other technical issues. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish.

1012498,A223395STT81FS,B000HCO83G,-*-Miss Lady-*-,"[5, 9]","Ok, in order for me to give my honest opinion I have to reflect on what I hated about this movie before going into what I loved.I am an old school X Men fan.  I knew everyone's powers, names, real names, and back stories.  So, I was looking forward to Phoenix coming out, and expecially for them to tell Jean's story.  X Men, had they kept true to the story line from the comics, could have went on for years like Harry Potter or Superman.  It's one of the greatest comics EVER to me, because of the social issues that it masks with calling people ""mutants"" rather than say, ""black"" or ""handicapped"" or even ""Jewish"" - or, hey, here's one, a ""terrorist.""  The idea behind X Men is that they are among us, and you won't always know who you're talking to or sitting next to.That in mind, I expected to see carnage and all hell breaking loose once Phoenix emerged.  You already knew it would happen.  But since everyone who knows the comics is familiar with the love story and what tames Phoenix, I expected to see her in the end with Scott and the Professor, working with some new students at the academy.No.  Instead I see Scott get killed off within the fisrt 15 minutes of the film, Storm's hair is CUT OFF (the character's trademark is her dam hair, how you gon' cut it off?!!), and Rogue - my favorite character because of how independent she was in the comics - my poor Rogue is contemplating getting rid of her powers to be closer to her boyfriend.  WTF is this new director doing?!!  Then they kill off Xavier.  How you gon' kill off the professor, and have Phoenix do it no less, as Magneto watches in amazement??  I was shocked.  Completely shocked.The special effects in this movie are amazing, and the story line, while upsetting and strange at times, was very good.  The idea of being able to ""cure"" mutants was intriguing, especially when the mutants divided between those who were tired of standing out and being different, those who wanted to be what was considered normal, and the group Magneto was in charge of, who were offended by this ""extermination"" that was taking place.  To me, the best twist was when you discovered that this ""cure"" wasn't man made - it was in the form of a little boy, a mutant, who rendered whatever powers you had useless.Overall, it honestly wasn't a bad movie.  It had an interesting ending and excellent acting.  I just really wish that they hadn't done some of the things in this one that they did.  I wanted to see more of Scott, Xavier, and less of Wolverine.  I wanted Rogue to come into her powers in this one and start showing some of her attitude that kept her popular with me.  Kelsy Grammer as Beast, by the way, was an excellent, albeit suprisingly, good choice.I would say that it's worth watching.  I'm curious to see what they end up doing with the ending, since Magneto is not completely powerless.",3,Spoilers included with my opinion - you were warned,1152230400,"07 7, 2006",2006,2859,"['Ok', 'order', 'give', 'honest', 'opinion', 'have', 'reflect', 'what', 'hated', 'movie', 'going', 'what', 'loved.I', 'am', 'old', 'school', 'X', 'Men', 'fan', 'knew', 'everyone', 'powers', 'names', 'real', 'names', 'back', 'stories', 'So', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'Phoenix', 'coming', 'out', 'expecially', 'tell', 'Jean', 'story', 'Men', 'had', 'kept', 'true', 'story', 'line', 'comics', 'could', 'have', 'went', 'years', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Superman', 'one', 'greatest', 'comics', 'EVER', 'social', 'issues', 'calling', 'people', 'mutants', 'rather', 'say', 'black', 'handicapped', 'even', 'Jewish', 'hey', 'here', 'one', 'terrorist', 'idea', 'X', 'Men', 'are', 'wo', ""n't"", 'always', 'know', 'who', ""'re"", 'talking', 'sitting', 'next', 'to.That', 'mind', 'expected', 'see', 'carnage', 'hell', 'breaking', 'loose', 'once', 'Phoenix', 'emerged', 'already', 'knew', 'would', 'happen', 'everyone', 'who', 'comics', 'familiar', 'love', 'story', 'what', 'Phoenix', 'expected', 'see', 'end', 'Scott', 'Professor', 'working', 'new', 'students', 'academy.No', 'Instead', 'see', 'Scott', 'get', 'killed', 'off', 'fisrt', '15', 'minutes', 'film', 'Storm', 'hair', 'CUT', 'OFF', 'character', 'trademark', 'dam', 'hair', 'how', 'gon', 'cut', 'off', 'Rogue', 'favorite', 'character', 'how', 'independent', 'was', 'comics', 'poor', 'Rogue', 'contemplating', 'getting', 'rid', 'powers', 'be', 'closer', 'boyfriend', 'WTF', 'new', 'director', 'doing', 'Then', 'kill', 'off', 'Xavier', 'How', 'gon', 'kill', 'off', 'professor', 'have', 'Phoenix', 'do', 'less', 'Magneto', 'watches', 'amazement', 'was', 'shocked', 'Completely', 'shocked.The', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'are', 'amazing', 'story', 'line', 'upsetting', 'strange', 'times', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'idea', 'being', 'able', 'cure', 'mutants', 'was', 'intriguing', 'especially', 'when', 'mutants', 'divided', 'who', 'were', 'tired', 'standing', 'out', 'being', 'different', 'who', 'wanted', 'be', 'what', 'was', 'considered', 'normal', 'group', 'Magneto', 'was', 'charge', 'who', 'were', 'offended', 'extermination', 'was', 'taking', 'place', 'best', 'twist', 'was', 'when', 'discovered', 'cure', 'was', ""n't"", 'man', 'made', 'was', 'form', 'little', 'boy', 'mutant', 'who', 'rendered', 'powers', 'had', 'useless.Overall', 'honestly', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'had', 'interesting', 'ending', 'excellent', 'acting', 'just', 'really', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'done', 'things', 'one', 'did', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'Scott', 'Xavier', 'less', 'Wolverine', 'wanted', 'Rogue', 'come', 'powers', 'one', 'start', 'showing', 'attitude', 'kept', 'popular', 'Kelsy', 'Grammer', 'Beast', 'way', 'was', 'excellent', 'suprisingly', 'good', 'choice.I', 'would', 'say', 'worth', 'watching', ""'m"", 'curious', 'see', 'what', 'end', 'up', 'doing', 'ending', 'Magneto', 'not', 'completely', 'powerless']",N/A
1012499,AKJ9MEE93DG5O,B000HCO83G,mitchell5954,"[0, 1]","X-Men the Last Stand is the film which marked the downfall of the X-Men franchise.  After X2 Brian Singer left the franchise to work on Superman Returns.  However, the studio wanted a new X-Men film as soon as possible, so they went on without Singer.  The series has never been the same since.  This film and every movie since have been incredible mediocre.  While this movie has great effects, great action, and can be entertaining, it is a big step down from the first two films.One thing that I hated was the killing of certain characters like they were nothing.  Cyclops is shafted even more here than in the first two movies, which is not a good thing.  Within the first half hour he is killed unceremoniously like he never mattered.  Cyclops is supposed to be the leader of the X-Men, so for him to get killed like he did is an insult to his character.  Professor X also gets the ax is this film in an equally idiotic fashion.  What is worse is that there is virtually no impact in both Cyclops and Professor X's deaths.  The rest of the team mourn but then move on like a scene or two later.If they did this to try to make the film darker then they totally failed.  Another bad aspect of this film is that it has a very uneven tone.  There are times where it is very dark and gritty and at other times where it feels very silly like Juggernaut doing one-liners or the X-Men cracking jokes while in the middle of a huge battle.  The point is that sometimes the film is very dark but at other times it is a fun comic book film, which is very weird.  I do not quite know who this movie is for.They introduce new mutants, like Angel, just for them to play a very minor role or do basically nothing.  These mutants are in the film just to be in the film and that is all.  The only new mutant that gets any push in the movie is Beast.  Beast is great and is one of the better aspects about the movie.  Other main characters from the other movies are just tossed aside like they do not matter.  Mystic and Rogue, who were both important characters in the previous films, are given nothing to do and are barely in the movie.I also did not like how they handled Jean Grey in this film.  In this movie they try to adapt the Phoenix saga from the comics.  However, the Phoenix is portrayed very different here than the source material.  In the comics the Phoenix is a symbiotic fire entity that possessed Jean and gave her the power to burn everything to ashes.  In the film the Phoenix is Jean's dual personality that was created from Professor X sealing up part of Jean's abilities when she was younger.  I do not care for this at all.  If they were trying to go for a more realistic approach then they failed.  If anything it made it sillier.The good aspects of this film are definitely the action scenes.  This film I will say has the best action scenes of all the X-Men films.  The final battle was especially enjoyable.  The effects are also phenomenal.  The effects for Beast are especially good.  This Beast looks ten times better than the Beast in X-Men First Class, which is sad because this film was made in 2006 compared to 2011.  They also got a better actor to play the role.  Ian McKellen does great once again as Magneto.  Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is still a badass.Overall, X-Men the Last Stand is an entertaining film as far as action goes.  However, the problems are major ones and besides the action the film is not very fun to sit through.  It was depressing really.  I do not recommend this to fans of the comics or fans of the first two films.  If you just want great action then give it a look.  The rest, however, I do not recommend it.",2,Beginning of The Down fall of the Franchise,1373241600,"07 8, 2013",2013,3658,"['X-Men', 'Last', 'Stand', 'film', 'marked', 'downfall', 'X-Men', 'franchise', 'X2', 'Brian', 'Singer', 'left', 'franchise', 'work', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'However', 'studio', 'wanted', 'new', 'X-Men', 'film', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'went', 'Singer', 'series', 'never', 'been', 'same', 'film', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'incredible', 'mediocre', 'movie', 'great', 'effects', 'great', 'action', 'can', 'be', 'entertaining', 'big', 'step', 'down', 'first', 'two', 'films.One', 'thing', 'hated', 'was', 'killing', 'certain', 'characters', 'were', 'nothing', 'Cyclops', 'shafted', 'even', 'more', 'here', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'not', 'good', 'thing', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'killed', 'unceremoniously', 'never', 'mattered', 'Cyclops', 'supposed', 'be', 'leader', 'X-Men', 'so', 'get', 'killed', 'did', 'insult', 'character', 'Professor', 'X', 'also', 'ax', 'film', 'equally', 'idiotic', 'fashion', 'What', 'worse', 'virtually', 'impact', 'Cyclops', 'Professor', 'X', 'deaths', 'rest', 'team', 'mourn', 'then', 'move', 'scene', 'two', 'did', 'try', 'make', 'film', 'darker', 'then', 'totally', 'failed', 'bad', 'aspect', 'film', 'very', 'uneven', 'tone', 'are', 'times', 'where', 'very', 'dark', 'gritty', 'other', 'times', 'where', 'very', 'silly', 'Juggernaut', 'doing', 'one-liners', 'X-Men', 'cracking', 'jokes', 'middle', 'huge', 'battle', 'point', 'sometimes', 'film', 'very', 'dark', 'other', 'times', 'fun', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'very', 'weird', 'do', 'not', 'quite', 'know', 'who', 'movie', 'for.They', 'introduce', 'new', 'mutants', 'Angel', 'just', 'play', 'very', 'minor', 'role', 'do', 'basically', 'nothing', 'mutants', 'are', 'film', 'just', 'be', 'film', 'only', 'new', 'mutant', 'push', 'movie', 'Beast', 'Beast', 'great', 'one', 'better', 'aspects', 'movie', 'Other', 'main', 'characters', 'other', 'movies', 'are', 'just', 'tossed', 'aside', 'do', 'not', 'matter', 'Mystic', 'Rogue', 'who', 'were', 'important', 'characters', 'previous', 'films', 'are', 'given', 'nothing', 'do', 'are', 'barely', 'movie.I', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'how', 'handled', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'film', 'movie', 'try', 'adapt', 'Phoenix', 'saga', 'comics', 'However', 'Phoenix', 'portrayed', 'very', 'different', 'here', 'source', 'material', 'comics', 'Phoenix', 'symbiotic', 'fire', 'entity', 'possessed', 'Jean', 'gave', 'power', 'burn', 'everything', 'ashes', 'film', 'Phoenix', 'Jean', 'dual', 'personality', 'was', 'created', 'Professor', 'X', 'sealing', 'up', 'part', 'Jean', 'abilities', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'were', 'trying', 'go', 'more', 'realistic', 'approach', 'then', 'failed', 'anything', 'made', 'sillier.The', 'good', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'definitely', 'action', 'scenes', 'film', 'will', 'say', 'best', 'action', 'scenes', 'X-Men', 'films', 'final', 'battle', 'was', 'especially', 'enjoyable', 'effects', 'are', 'also', 'phenomenal', 'effects', 'Beast', 'are', 'especially', 'good', 'Beast', 'ten', 'times', 'better', 'Beast', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'sad', 'film', 'was', 'made', '2006', 'compared', '2011', 'also', 'got', 'better', 'actor', 'play', 'role', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'great', 'once', 'again', 'Magneto', 'Wolverine', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'still', 'badass.Overall', 'X-Men', 'Last', 'Stand', 'entertaining', 'film', 'as', 'far', 'action', 'However', 'problems', 'are', 'major', 'ones', 'action', 'film', 'not', 'very', 'fun', 'sit', 'was', 'depressing', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'fans', 'comics', 'fans', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'just', 'want', 'great', 'action', 'then', 'give', 'look', 'rest', 'however', 'do', 'not', 'recommend']",N/A

The departure of cerebral director Bryan Singer for the sledgehammer simplicity of Brett Ratner did not bode well for the franchises' future.  Thrown in the fact that the writers of ""X2"" left with Singer and Zak Penn (Inspector Gadget) and Simon Kinberg (Mr. and Mrs. Smith) replaced them, and the thematic weight, intelligence and character development that made the first two ""X-Men"" movies so satisfying looked as if it was going to be severely handicapped.  Sadly, that is just what happened.""The Last Stand"" did start off with promising premise:  A pharmaceutical company run by a mutant-phobe (Michael Murphy) creates a way to suppress the mutant genes in all the world's mutants.  Marketed as a benevolent cure, the X-Men (Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier, Halle Berry as Storm and newcomer Kelsey Grammar doing unexpectedly great work as the warmly intellectual Beast) and all their fellow mutants have to grapple with the ethical implications and consequences that the cure presents.  What would a person, mutant or otherwise, do if they had the power to remove genetic differences they had with an accepted norm and avoid the possible persecution that comes with beng an outsider?  However, the nefarious Magneto (an ever-superb Ian McKellen) sees the cure as a way to subdue and eradicate the mutant population.  The X-Men, caught in the middle between the humans and Magneto's growing army of disaffected and threatened Mutants, have to step up and fight in a desparate end-game.But the promise and potential of the premise is wasted.  The question of the cure is raised, but it is never plumbed for thematic richness, and in the end, it is simply used as a weapon to deliver visceral, shallow thrills.  Ratner, Penn, and Kinberg do their plot no favors by throwing in the saga of Jean Grey as the ressurected Phoenix (Famke Jansen), and way too many new characters.  None of the story's nourishing sub-plots or supporting characters are germinated or allowed to mature, and the emotional impact of the movie is blunted by the overdose of too much mutant mayhem, plot and chaos.

1012509,A16EFYPXAFHZRY,B000HCO83G,Nate Hananger,"[3, 5]","I've been a fan of the X-men for over a decade now and I'll honestly admit that my complaints outnumber my compliments for this film, and the entire trilogy of X-men movies.I'd say the best quality of it has been the choice of actors/actresses for certain rolls. Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Halle Barry, Kelsey Grammer, Vinnie Jones, Ian McKellen and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos were all great for their rolls. In fact, they were so great that it's unlikely such a unique combination of stars will be able to outperform them in the event that somebody tries to tell the story correctly.The worst quality I've seen is that characters were introduced in the wrong order. For example, Beast and Angel were two members of the original X-men (I have the poster) and they came before Wolverine, Storm, Colossus, Nightcrawler, Shadowcat, or Jubilee.The second worst part is how so many characters were killed off just for shock value, and this was done before missing characters were even brought into the film (ie: Gambit, the Blob, Psylocke, just to name a few).Another part that bothered me was that Nightcrawler didn't return for X3. He more than proved himself in X2, but then just vanished, as he's known to do.Plus, Rogue, Cyclops, and Angel all had minor rolls in The Last Stand. Plus, how could they rob Rogue of her powers like that before she gains her superhuman strength & flying ability from Ms. Marvel? That sucks.Personally, I think the trilogy would've been far more successful if:1) Arnold had played Colossus2) Lucy Lu had played Psylocke3) Jean Claude Van Damme had played Gambit4) Characters were introduced in the right order5) Perhaps someone was brought in for the roll of Blob & Morph, with a little comedic relief, like John Goodman & Ryan Renolds.If all that had been done, Hollywood would've probably been able to get away with killing so many team members on each side, but that sucked too. It would've been great to see a rematch between Wolverine and Sabretooth.I've heard this is supposed to be the ""Return Of The Jedi"" conclusion for the X-men movies so I guess all of these flaws will remain unfixed.Better luck next time, Hollwood!

Durham ""Big Evil""","[2, 6]","With Bryan Singer and his writing team moving on to the Superman franchise, Marvel and Fox scrambled to get the third, and for now final, X-Men film out as quick as possible, with director Brett Ratner getting to direct the installment.  Now make no mistake, Ratner is a hack director at best, and his best talents are displayed in the many action scenes throughout the film, many of which are nicely done.  The story picks up a while after X2, with Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Storm (Halle Berry) training a young group of mutants including Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), Rogue (Anna Paquin), Shadowcat (Ellen Paige), and Colossus (Daniel Cudmore) while Cyclops (James Marsden) is still mourning the death of Jean (Famke Janssen).  In the meantime, a cure for mutants is announced, prompting Magneto (Ian McKellen) to organize his Brotherhood as Jean returns from the dead to make short work of Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and anyone else in her way.  For the most part, X-Men: The Last Stand is solid enough to stand out on it's own, but it really misses the touch that Singer and his crew had on the characters.  The dark tone is still here, but the characterization injected in the previous two films gets the second tier treatment here.  Many characters, mainly Cyclops and Rogue, are almost completely ignored to make way for new characters like Beast (Kelsey Grammer, perfectly cast) and Angel (Ben Foster, who plays a much lesser role than you would think), while new villains are introduced including Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones, yes, Vinnie Jones in a fake looking muscle suit and all) and Multiple Man (Eric Dane), while Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) and Pyro (Aaron Stanford) get a backseat.  There's loads of in-references that longtime X-fans will get (the Days of Futures Past nod is a nice touch, and Stan Lee and Chris Claremont make cameos), but to believe that this is the last X-Men film is just silly.

Sure, I was stunned by Professor X's and Cyclops early departure, especially since it comes at the hands Gray/Phoenix.  I was surprise that Wolverwine doesn't exhibit any guilt.  If he hadn't set Phoenix loose in the first place, none of this would have happened.  Berry's Storm as usual was boring, Rogue, I always thought was a boring mutant.  Honestly, I thought the boy was going to be the answer to curing Phoenix, since no one's powers work around him, but it doesn't seem that answer occured to anyone.  So we bring Gray back just to kill her again.  I love the explanation to how she returned: ""I don't know"".  Alrighty then.  Why not just have her say ""because the screenwriters said so""?

I did not like the movie too much the first time through, and you can only see a movie for the first time once, so it left a sour feeling in my mind. Well, I bought the movie on Blu-Ray, and I gotta say... the feeling is still there, it's just a little better. The movie picks up right after X2 ended, with Cyclops still grieving over the death of Jean-Grey, Logan is still the smart-aleck ""substitute"" teacher, and Professor X is having these mental issues that lead back to a little girl from 20 years ago. To say that Bryan Singer is missed is an under statement, for a lot of the issues and themes from the old films don't resonate as much. The acting is still good, but what really hit some of those sour notes were the liberties they took with the characters. As a fan of the old animated series and some of the later comic books, it was rather dissapointing to see some of the characters go, and some to not come back at all.(Nightcrawler, anyone?) Another one of my issues was how the closure was handled. To, me it was flat and lifeless. For example, when Pyro and Iceman had their duel, Iceman headbutts Pyro and that is it. You don't see anymore of his character. Closure like this makes me feel unhappy, at least compared to the prior films. Also, what was up with the mutant that was the cure? Other than that plot device, he had no other role in the film. He could've been substituted by a cow, and it wouldn't have made a difference. The action was great, and the special effects snazzy, but overall, it was an average flick. Oh, well. Here's hoping ""Origins"" hits the right spots.The Blu-Ray:No complains here. The video is definitely top notch. It's very minimally grainy, though its natural, retaining the film look and feel. Colors are spot-on, contrast is never blown out (though a little too bright during the white room scenes with the ""cure"" mutant) and blacks are deep. Great video!The audio is also a heart-stopper. The DTS HD Mix on this disc is a heavy-hitter, with some deep, low bass and great directionality, never having any issues with dialogue. This is a truly worthy mix. Great demo material indeed!So, I give it a four star rating instead of a three because of the great production values of the Disc.

This instead is just a general and mega-galactic shootout with almost no plot nor true sense of who or what we lost in the process.In the end, one is almost glad it's all over, but not in the sense the filmmakers probably intended.No, we are just glad, that this film is over and can get the other two out of their sleeves and make them play for us one more time, the way they were, and in the meanwhile, imagine how the true ending could have been like, if only a talented writer had been hired to do so.Sorry, but my two stars go for thanking the fact that they probably won't make a sequel out of this one. At least I hope so.What a pity and what a shame. It had started so well, only to land in the trash-bin.Not even the honest attempts made by Ian McKellen to bring back the deviousness of Magneto served the purpose, and when such an actor, of his caliber, cannot save a movie of this kind, than there is something very, very wrong with it.Sorry guys, to disappoint you with my comments, but this is what I truly feel.The transfer on DVD is well made, both in picture and sound quality and even sports a DTS option, which due to the abismal quality of the movie itself, is no big gift either.Better stick to ""X-Men"" and ""X2 - X-Men United"", it is money better spent.",2,"Every legend has to come to an end, but then again...",1177027200,"04 20, 2007",2007,2119,"['first', 'two', 'installments', 'where', 'lyric', 'scope', 'third', 'one', 'true', 'let', 'down.A', 'hurried', 'fumbled', 'project', 'filled', 'rim', 'special', 'effects', 'action', 'brainless', 'empty', 'tin', 'can.Patrick', 'Stewart', 'disappearance', 'bit', 'here', 'perhaps', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'embarrassing', 'have', 'stayed', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'automatons', 'playing', 'numbers', 'Gone', 'are', 'well', 'developed', 'characterizations', 'other', 'two', 'movies.Is', 'just', 'director', 'was', ""n't"", 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'Somehow', 'doubt', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'script', 'was', 'probably', 'cause', 'such', 'confused', 'weak', 'ending.Pity', 'second', 'movie', 'waited', 'majestic', 'ending', 'sort', 'Clash', 'Titans', 'something', 'solid', 'serious', 'dramatic', 'as', 'well', 'instead', 'just', 'general', 'mega-galactic', 'shootout', 'almost', 'plot', 'true', 'sense', 'who', 'what', 'lost', 'process.In', 'end', 'one', 'almost', 'glad', 'not', 'sense', 'filmmakers', 'probably', 'intended.No', 'are', 'just', 'glad', 'film', 'can', 'get', 'other', 'two', 'sleeves', 'make', 'play', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'way', 'were', 'meanwhile', 'imagine', 'how', 'true', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'only', 'talented', 'writer', 'had', 'been', 'hired', 'do', 'so.Sorry', 'two', 'stars', 'go', 'thanking', 'fact', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'sequel', 'one', 'least', 'hope', 'pity', 'what', 'shame', 'had', 'started', 'so', 'well', 'only', 'land', 'trash-bin.Not', 'even', 'honest', 'attempts', 'made', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'bring', 'back', 'deviousness', 'Magneto', 'served', 'purpose', 'when', 'such', 'actor', 'caliber', 'can', 'not', 'save', 'movie', 'kind', 'something', 'very', 'very', 'wrong', 'it.Sorry', 'guys', 'disappoint', 'comments', 'what', 'truly', 'feel.The', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'well', 'made', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'even', 'sports', 'DTS', 'option', 'due', 'abismal', 'quality', 'movie', 'big', 'gift', 'either.Better', 'stick', 'X-Men', 'X2', 'X-Men', 'United', 'money', 'better', 'spent']",N/A

There are bound to be a lot of people who won't like it just on principle (e.g. it doesn't follow the comics, it isn't 'serious' film, it's just milking the success of the first two).While a technically very stunning film, it suffers from a bit of plot weakness. Juggling tying up themes from the previous two X-Men movies with showing more of the comics' mutants ""neglected"" previously, it tries to do too much -- but it does the individual parts very well. The scenes are well-crafted and the special effects are marvelous, but the story as a whole seemed rather half-hearted.Other reviewers have mentioned the sub-par acting of some of the lead actors, but I found many of the supporting actors put in very good performances.  It's hard to find any fault with the special effects, unless it's (almost) overkill: they threaten to overshadow what good plotline there is. Not that there is no good use of plotlines here: the final confrontation of Wolverine and Magneto was a brilliant take on the theme of their previous movie encounters; there are just too few of such gems.Of the three X-Men movies, this is the primary ""action"" one and is least able to stand on its own; the first was necessarily more ""plot"" oriented, while the second was probably the most ""balanced"" (and my personal favorite of the three, by a hair over the first).

1012531,A1D3XQC2DIT,B000HCO83G,Peter Shermeta,"[6, 9]","The FDA has found a ""cure"" to the common ""disease"" shared by mutants. It is up to Magneto's Brotherhood to stop the drug from being used to eradicate the population of mutants. The drug will allegedly be used on a voluntary basis only so the X-Men would like to help keep the peace. The Brotherhood is more skeptical and anticipates it being used with malicious intent. It is war the ensues.Well at least war was what the trailer and previews lead you to believe. My thoughts on the movie ahead of time were simple: the plot will be severely lacking, but with a mutant war I will be able to sit there in my geeky glory and try to pick out which mutants I recognize from the TV series and the old comic books. That which was delivered fell well short of that which was promised/expected.The actual ""war"" scene was only cool because Wolverine and Beast went crazy. Their choreographed fight scenes were fun to watch. Beyond that, there was nothing. The ""war"" scene lasted only a few minutes and it consisted of Magneto and Pyro sending Juggernaut into the building and unleashing an infantry of lesser mutants against the opposition while they stood back lobbed exploding cars.Before I go on with my analysis, I really need the answer to a question. Are they making another X-Men movie? There has been speculation in both directions. Yes, there will be a fourth installment; we're not done yet. No, the X-Men group movies are over, make way for solo stories (it was called The LAST Stand for a reason...).If there will be no fourth movie, then I think the ending and much of the story throughout X-Men 3 was incredibly pointless. You will have to ask me separately for my more pointed spoiler complaints.They took such care in introducing Warren Worthington A/K/A Archangel, yet he was very under-used and remained entirely excluded from the action.There was talk about a reduced budget for X-Men 3, and yet we see so much time and money wasted on a prolonged scene where Magneto uproots half of the Golden Gate Bridge and flies it across the water... Just take a boat. Or rewrite the script to Worthington labs is on the mainland so they can walk.Why did they get our geek hopes up with a teaser fight scene with a Sentinal...only to dash said hopes because it was just a fight simulation in the Danger Room?The fun of the books and TV show for me is that they were basically like a Street Fighter video game where each cut scene would pit two mutants with comparable powers against each other and they would fight. The movies really try to add a real world element that takes the fun away. The creators have hundreds of mutants at their disposal and they opt against introducing so many of them. The story could write itself if someone would just do a little research into characters.The movie was decent enough. I can say that I have seen it and participate in the angst-filled discussions going forward.

1012532,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B000HCO83G,P. Hardy,"[0, 0]","Its been four/five years since X2 - X-MEN UNITED was released in theaters and was hailed by audiences everywhere (negative or positive). To be frank a lot happened in the span of four years ---Bryan Singer ditching the ""X"" production for ""Superman"" among other things--- and X-MEN: The last stand really shows what four years without the headmaster and an excellent writing team can do to an over-popular movie franchise that seemed to work even when a lot CBM's didn't. For some reason the characters, the storyline and the movie itself seemed to suffer from its own ego and poor writing. For starters, Brent Ratner did not do a horrible job as far as directing movies go. However, if you gonna blame someone (beyond Ratner) then blame the producers, the scenario, and screenplay writers. Storyline based on Joss Whedon's ""Mutant Cure"" storyline in ""ASTONISHING X-MEN"" and the ever-famous DARK PHOENIX saga reveals that LAST STAND had potential enough to become third greatest movie of the X-MEN series but falls flat because of lack of depth in the characters and the introduction of way too many NEW characters to merit something wonderful. THE LAST STAND was like watching a big-budget show and tell at school: The mutants would show up on screen, flaunt their gifts in their fifteen minutes of fame, then become a distant memory or in this case an extra actor.I was expecting the flashback concerning Magneto and Professor X going to the Grey household to recruit Jean Grey to be interesting or at least impressive. It was none of the above. While the ""DE-Aging"" CGI they used on Stewart and McKellen was impressive the scene felt like it was directed and acted out in a campy kind of way. There was not a serious atmosphere about it in short. The storyline from there feels like it wants to become something. Especially when they use about half the movie's hour talking and planning things. Another thing that irked me was that the movie had the humans announcing they, or rather Angel's father, had created a permanent cure for the mutant 'disease' -- with the use of a mutant child named Leech (Camron Bright)-- instead of the diplomatically immune alien Ord [""The terrible""?] who originally brought the means of the cure to the female Dr. Kavita Rao. In truth, it suffers from the same problem BLADE: TRINITY suffered from. The introduction of new characters, the misuse of the focal character, and weak storyline. Only that movie managed to merit something as memorable opposed to LAST STAND. The storyline in XM:TLS was not fleshed out as well as the previous movies storylines were. The fact that there were far too many subplots attached to many of the new (good and bad) or old characters that were never dwelled on was a bloody shame. And the ending, to me, was just too ""Happily Ever After,"" and unsurprisingly unfinal.Tweaking of the previous characters such as Storm, Rogue, Bobby, Wolverine, Jean, Magneto, and Pryo was a positive and negative. The simple fact that Halle Berry was given something more to do in this film besides look pretty and let the FX do the all the work was major hit with me. If anything she was the true spectacle of the entire film; She acted like the leader she was potrayed as in the comics and her action sequences were the best! Even Halle's acting felt like it got better for some particular reason. I was disappointed with her fight scenes with Callisto. All Callisto seemed to do her was run circles around her then knee Storm in the stomach in both their fights. Plus the camera was in too close on the actresses in some scenes. The disappearance of Rogue's character was an all round disappointment to me: She was literally shoved aside to give the 3d actress for Kitty Pryde for screen time; Even the chemistry between Anna Paquin and Hugh Jackman was missing in their short moment on-screen together. This was the movie I was really hoping -- like they did with Storm -- would do something with the timid Southern Belle who was the focal point of the first movie. Alas it was not to be. Pryo's character wasn't shown nor did it change much from the second movie. As far as being Magneto's right hand man and rival to Ice-man he did nothing except show off his funky near bleach-blond hair style and fire mechanisms on his wrists.Jean Grey was never my favorite character to begin with, though it may be simply because people place her character on such a high mantle of glory, but Famke Jansen's performance was good as the Dark Phoenix. I was both happy and unmoved by the change of personality for this so-focused on female lead. Her darker persona fit her characterism a lot better her good-guy persona did. However, the disappointments I had with her character is that she barely showed remorse for ""killing"" Cyclops, and Xavier. Her DARK PHOENIX persona lacked whatever sinister-like qualities that made her so cool in the comics. Wolverine and Magneto were probably the biggest disappointments for me in LAST STAND: Wolverine's character went from ""loner/father figure (X-Men)"" - ""demi-gallant (X2)"" - to ""Puppy-dog looking to move in on Cyclops' vacant spot"" in the LAST STAND. While they stayed true to his obsession for Jean Grey, Wolverine seemed so far removed from his original character from the previous films that I almost thought I was looking at another person altogether.Sure he still retained the same quirks that made him Wolverine, but he just lacked that certain something that made him so cool to me in the movies. Magneto's character went from cunningly smart to stupidly reckless and absentminded in the span of four years. His character seemed to rush into things and ditch members of his brotherhood quicker than a man could yodel in the mountains. Even his decisions on how to deal with the humans and their cure seemed absurd and unlogical. Ian McKellen's acting seemed way off in the movie; He was very un-Magneto. Lastly, Iceman was more or less a simple unexplored plot-device for the untouched Rogue/Bobby/Shadowcat triangle. He was also among the non-liked characters on my list and his characterization in the movie just gave me more of a reason to dislike him. To be frank I favored the first Actress they used for Shadowcat, Sumela Kay, as opposed to the second actress, Katie Stuart, and Ellen Page. Page just did not have the acting abilities to make Kitty something of a memorable character like Anna Paquin did for Rogue. If anything she made her unbearingly annoying with her less than average performance. Other characters like Beast (Grammar) and Colossus are instant likeables. My only problem with both characters was that Beast was made a diplomat and not a scientist and Colossus was not focused on much as a main character.The axing of most veteran characters for the barely touched upon new characters was also a problem. While he was never my favorite character to begin with, shunting Cyclops was probably the second biggest mistake the film made just so it could focus on the ""Wolverine x Jean"" attraction. I read GIFTED and watched the PHOENIX/DARK PHOENIX arc in the animated series and it didn't dawn on me until the end of the movie what they really could've done with his character. Among other things, it was that dynamic in Cyclops' and Jean's relationship that made the PHOENIX/DARK PHOENIX saga compelling. And he is the leader after all, but the films demoted him to less than a background character. Alas, I really blame SUPERMAN RETURNS for the lack of Cyclops in the movie. Seriously, what is James Marsden gonna do?: Get shunted again by his lady-friend (Lois) for Superman? The de-mutanizing of Mystique was horrible: The coolest female character in the franchise and they axed her with a fate she considers whose than death. It was like they really wanted to focus more on Callisto as Magneto's right hand woman and rid us of Rebecca Stamos' character. Which also begs to the questions: How did the Government catch Mystique in the first place if she was masqurading as Senator Kelly? There wasn't even a mention of her capture on the news in the movie. The death of Professor Xavier, while emotionally moving, was kind of a disaster waiting to happen. It was as though the screenplay writers could not think of what to do with his character and simply decided to kill him off for some short lived arbitrary drama. Which sucked, Patrick Stewart was the probably the best actor in the entire movie.Now as for the subject of acting?: Most of the originally actors seem to put the same heart they used in the previous two films, even the ones that were wrongfully axed. But as this very short movie progresses you begin to notice the newcomers and other previous actors are lacking in serious atmosphere and talent. But most notably Hugh Jackman and Ian McKellen were the weakest of the originals. They hardly seemed to take their roles seriously and thus were far too campy. Famke Jennsen was all right playing her darker persona Phoenix, but when it came to her ""emotional"" scenes with Jackman they lacked a serious something that would've made these scenes spark. Grammar as beast is another actor that did surprisingly well in his role as the DIPLOMAT Hank McCoy/Best. Even the sillest lines he made his own and convincing enough to sound like something The Beast would say. The CGI in the film was a hit and miss in most terms of the phrase. Most of the time the CGI looked amazing and somewhat of an improvement over the previous films. Storm's FX was the best out of the entire film. The way they had her performing her attacks or just the simple flying scenes were cool, well thought out. Other times it just looked visibly horrible and unfinished in a lot of the scenes. Most notably when Jean was lifting her house from the ground, Multiple-man (as I dubbed him), when Bobby freezes over (his mouth is not timed well with his words), Juggernaut and Shadowcat were playing tag with each other near the end of the movie, and then Jean's powers shredding everything she focuses on. Another disappointment is that they didn't show the SENTINEL beyond blinding headlights and its head falling to the ground in defeat! A major rip off for fans of this massive robot. The action sequences in the film were something to behold though they were noticeable problems with the wire tricks -- Colossus tossing Wolverine and Beast jumping around pummeling everyone.All in all they got the adrenaline pumping afterward. The score composed by John Powell was all right; It suited the action-esque atmosphere in the movie but you'll be hard pressed to even bother paying attention to it. Most of the time you'll hear the theme of the movie, maybe an action BGM here and there but the audio of the film itself will drown out the score so it'll be nonexistent to the ears. All in all ""X-MEN THE LAST STAND"" is a half&half; kind of movie; A major disappointment from such a highly praised movie series. -------- [3 out of 5]",3,"""Oh, How the Mighty Have Fallen...."",

1012533,A3V61K0EF38GP4,B000HCO83G,Philip Scholz,"[0, 0]","The X-Men film series is still staying strong...that's not easy to pull off three films in, so it's very commendable.  Here, our heroes are faced with the announcement of a cure for the mutant gene and opinions on this are quite  split.Not only is there a cure to think about, but, for the first time, we learn much more about Jean Grey, played by Famke Janssen, who sacrificed herself in X2 to keep her friends and teammates from drowning in a flooding dam.  We learn what many X-Men fans already know about, the alternate personality of hers known as the Phoenix.  This identity allows her to survive the last film's flooding and has now taken her over completely, something that Professor Charles Xavier, played by Patrick Stewart, has spent years working to prevent as the Phoenix is dangerous at best for Jean and those around her.Meanwhile, someone who is clearly not thrilled about the mutant cure is Magneto, played by Sir Ian McKellen.  He asembles a team, which, for the first time to my knowledge in this film series, is given the name Brotherhood of Mutants, to forcefully oppose this cure, in the process abandoning a recently-imprisoned Mystique, played by Rebecca Romijn, who jumped in the way of a cure dart meant for her leader, taking the dose herself and becoming human.  With there being differing views on this cure even within the X-Men's own ranks, a battle is brewing, all while Jean Grey continues to lose more and more control to the Phoenix.This film definitely had more gimmicky moments than the last two (i.e. Logan's line ""Class is dismissed"" after a rough session in the Danger Room.)  Also, why house the facility with the cure on Alcatraz Island.  I can understand Magneto targeting the Statue of Liberty in the first film, but there's no real point to this setup here.  If you wanted to house the cure facility in a prison, I can name plenty of active and defunct facilities on the mainland that are much more secure.  If you needed a recognizable landmark...again, more secure ones on the mainland are available.I also have a problem with Magneto abandoning Mystique when she was cured.  First, she's been loyal to a fault for two films.  Second, she took that cure dart for him like someone would take a bullet.  Third, the woman was pleading not to be left behind.  I know Magneto not the nicest guy in the world, but I never saw him as being that cold.But there is an upside to that scene.  The prison that Magneto and his crew infiltrate to break out Mystique and other potential recruits is pretty cool...not as cool as the prison from the first two films, but still pretty cool.  Plus, it shows that our government is doing something about the mutants who are giving good mutants a bad name.  Sure, a few gimmicky aspects (i.e. Multiple Man having robbed multiple banks at once) but I'll let that go.What's also great is that the cast, for the most part, are all still the same as the first two films.  Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat is a new addition even though we've seen and heard about this character in the first two films.  But those were all pretty brief cameos which had her showing off her phasing powers more than anything else, so I'll let that inconsistency go.  The real crime here is not giving Ellen Page much more to do in this film.  Come on!  She's a very talent actress!  Give her like twenty more scenes.  Oh well...let's hope that with Ellen Page in the role, Kitty Pryde is here to stay.Someone who was also short-changed in terms of his screen time was Kelsey Grammer, who joined the cast as Dr. Hank McCoy/Beast.  I knew little beforehand about this character except for that he was smart, blue, and furry.  Here, he's the U.S. Secretary for Mutant Affairs on the President's Cabinet.  Such an awesome character with such an awesome position being played by such an awesome actor deserves more.  I can only hope that he too will be seen much more in the future.This film is about 95% as great as its predecessors.  Any X-Men fan should go see it.  If you've never seen an X-Men film before, watch them all...you'll be right on board then.

1012534,ALWB64XOXNMDP,B000HCO83G,Picardfan007,"[4, 8]","X-Men III with Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman and all the others fill out this cast in a non stop action fest.  The special effects we've seen before in other films but it still stands as a solid action film.  It's something I'd watch again. Without Bryan Singer, it's still a good film.The film starts with the senator Worthington has a cure for mutants.  It all begins from there as there is a dividing line between humans and the serum to suppress the mutant genes, permanently.  Hugh Jackman gets most of the lines in this one.  We get to see the demise of three characters, whom I am not going to say here, but it's going to be hard to bring them back for sequels.  I only wish that there's a way to bring them back in flashback scenes or holographic programs.  The scene in the beginning took place in a Star Trek Next Generation style holo deck.  I don't know if this was done in the comic but it does lift a few Trek concepts.Kelsey Grammar does a superb job of the Beast.  He has a small amount of time on the screen and chews up the scenery.  Back in the 70's the Beast was the wild card member. He wasn't always that Blue Haired Wolfman.  I wish that the characters that made brief appearances had something more to do.  Colossus should have had more to do than throw Wolverine into battle.  Juggernaut had much more cunning and intelligence in the comics.  He was wearing sculpted muscles in this one.I was hoping that we'd get some of the comics script into the film.  In the original version, Phoenix was shot by a laser cannon unknown to Scott (Cyclops) Summers. The comics version had them in on alien planet giant arena fighting for their lives.  With CGI, it would have been possible to reproduce the environment in the comic.  I was hoping Chris Claremont would have had a hand in the script.The comic insert was a good addition.  They should have added the DVD ROM of the first 500 issues as a selling point.  I was disappointed to see original X-Men artists Dave Cockrum, George Perez, and Tom Palmer not have any of their stories in the comic.  I love the Jack Kirby ones but they have been reprinted endlessly in best of collections.The good thing I do have to say about the film is that it can be seen repeatedly.  There are a lot of comic elements that make this film a keeper.  The conflict between Xavier and Magneto is much deeper.  It's not a conventional battle because they were best friends at one time and had great respect for one another.From what I've read the next film is going to be a solo Wolverine film.  I'd like to see the origin of Wolverine portrayed in the next one.",5,More Action Less Substance..still a good movie,1159920000,"10 4, 2006",2006,2625,"['X-Men', 'III', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'others', 'fill', 'out', 'cast', 'non', 'stop', 'action', 'fest', 'special', 'effects', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'still', 'solid', 'action', 'film', 'something', ""'d"", 'watch', 'again', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'still', 'good', 'film.The', 'film', 'senator', 'Worthington', 'cure', 'mutants', 'there', 'dividing', 'line', 'humans', 'serum', 'suppress', 'mutant', 'genes', 'permanently', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'most', 'lines', 'one', 'get', 'see', 'demise', 'three', 'characters', 'whom', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'say', 'here', 'going', 'be', 'hard', 'bring', 'back', 'sequels', 'only', 'wish', 'way', 'bring', 'back', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'holographic', 'programs', 'scene', 'beginning', 'took', 'place', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'style', 'holo', 'deck', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'done', 'comic', 'lift', 'few', 'Trek', 'concepts.Kelsey', 'Grammar', 'superb', 'job', 'Beast', 'small', 'amount', 'time', 'screen', 'up', 'scenery', 'Back', '70', 'Beast', 'was', 'wild', 'card', 'member', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'Blue', 'Haired', 'Wolfman', 'wish', 'characters', 'made', 'brief', 'appearances', 'had', 'something', 'more', 'do', 'Colossus', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'do', 'throw', 'Wolverine', 'battle', 'Juggernaut', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'cunning', 'intelligence', 'comics', 'was', 'wearing', 'sculpted', 'muscles', 'one.I', 'was', 'hoping', ""'d"", 'get', 'comics', 'script', 'film', 'original', 'version', 'Phoenix', 'was', 'shot', 'laser', 'cannon', 'unknown', 'Scott', 'Cyclops', 'Summers', 'comics', 'version', 'had', 'alien', 'planet', 'giant', 'arena', 'fighting', 'lives', 'CGI', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'possible', 'reproduce', 'environment', 'comic', 'was', 'hoping', 'Chris', 'Claremont', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'hand', 'script.The', 'comic', 'insert', 'was', 'good', 'addition', 'should', 'have', 'added', 'DVD', 'ROM', 'first', '500', 'issues', 'selling', 'point', 'was', 'disappointed', 'see', 'original', 'X-Men', 'artists', 'Dave', 'Cockrum', 'George', 'Perez', 'Tom', 'Palmer', 'not', 'have', 'stories', 'comic', 'love', 'Jack', 'Kirby', 'ones', 'have', 'been', 'reprinted', 'endlessly', 'best', 'collections.The', 'good', 'thing', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'repeatedly', 'are', 'lot', 'comic', 'elements', 'make', 'film', 'keeper', 'conflict', 'Xavier', 'Magneto', 'much', 'deeper', 'not', 'conventional', 'battle', 'were', 'best', 'friends', 'one', 'time', 'had', 'great', 'respect', 'one', 'another.From', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'next', 'film', 'going', 'be', 'solo', 'Wolverine', 'film', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'origin', 'Wolverine', 'portrayed', 'next', 'one']",N/A

At 104 minutes, there is hardly enough time (as the movie shows) to develop the dozens of characters that are a) introduce and b) have disappeared.  Major characters are simply written off or ignored.  While Wolverine is my favorite and certainly takes the lead role along with Jean Gray, Storm, whom I would describe as one of the least popular characters, even though played by a very attractive actress, is pushed to the forefront (rumor has it because because Halle Barry threw a fit about her small roles).  Characters are introduced and lead you to believe that they will serve a purpose, then you don't see them again for an hour, at which time they make a 10-second appearance.  Also, the pseudo-goth mutants that Magneto takes on as his proverbial ""posse"", are laughable.  The 'no one understands me so I'll wear all black and cover myself in piercings' has worn very thin.  All these things aside, i did have a problem with the final fight scene with Magneto and Pyro - like they couldn't find anything better to do than toss burning car after burning car for 5 consecutive minutes?

1012536,AB1UMC7SB9D7Z,B000HCO83G,"PolarisDiB ""dibness""","[6, 9]","This review is fraught with spoilers because there's no way to express all of my viewpoints without really engaging some of the happenings of the movie.  You have been warned.I have never expected to like any of the X-men movies. The first X-men surprised me with how willing it was to take the time to develop so many different characters, and X2 had enough good action and follow-up character development to make it surprisingly good as well. With the mixed reviews of this one, I figured I wouldn't like it at all. I liked some of it; it exceeded my expectations. But it's still highly flawed and I don't like the direction it took.The key problem with this movie is that it makes the ultimate transition away from what the mutant's powers MEAN to focusing more on what they DO. That means while the writers and Ratner were more than willing to figure out interesting battles, they lost track of a lot of motifs and arcs that could fully encompass the general trend of the movies and make it very good. The driving force behind the franchise has always been the tension between mutants and humans and what to do with that tension, but this one seemed much more willing to give that (and any actual drama) second tier to just hurrying up and getting through all the events that it seems must take place. Unfortunately for Ratner, removing the drama and the point makes the events not matter, which means ultimately a very poor cinema experience.For example, most of the mutants introduced are no longer introduced by how important they are to the main circle and how they help range the debate and understand this new world everyone's entering... mostly they're just introduced as a contrivance to get the plot moving along. I'm definitely not the only one who thinks Angel could have been cut completely from the movie and not changed much. Leech and Phoenix also suffer this fractured character arch, most especially represented by the completely anticlimactic and unnecessarily random ending: The driving force of involving Leech is that he can suck powers away. The driving force of involving Phoenix is that she has an excess of power. Well look at that, don't those two make a great opposites cancel out! Unfortunately, I think the writers decided not to go that route because it would be too obvious... or worse, they didn't even think of it. Whatever the case, they missed a precise and organized denouement to the proceeds, ultimately causing both threads to be mostly spectators to the events as they unfold instead of their supposed function of indicators. In fact, now that I think about it, nothing in explaining who Phoenix is explains why she'd join Magneto like that anyway.This complete lack of functionality is further proof of the loss of focus on what the powers mean. I mean, come on... She's a phoenix, literally. Rise from the grave, more power, passionate... the openness to symbolism and the effect on the human/mutant debate is almost limitless.... did Ratner care? No, he seemed more interested in presenting situation after situation which ultimately proves that we're not even going to pretend Wolverine can die at this point.In fact, for a movie willing to kill off very iconic characters (though, maybe, not really...), it seems unwilling to really understand what killing off those characters will ultimately mean to the remaining mutant characters. Deaths are dealt with with a quick moment of silence and then a discussion of what to do next. There is no grief, or fear, or guilt or anything. What it really feels like Ratner says to his production during these scenes is, ""All right, the audience already knows what this means to the characters and stuff, no need to linger... let's move on to the next scene."" Not only does that suck the drama right out of the proceeds, it also pretty much destroys its pacing.Luckily for it, the movie has some pretty strong moments spattered here and there despite itself. The race between Juggernaut and Kitty was excellent, and for some reason I really started digging the enmity between Pyro and Bobby (even if it did feel like a cheap Star Wars rip-off from time to time). I also loved the imagery around the protesters and the people waiting for the cure, because during that time the movie alludes to famous protests from around the world.Otherwise, the movie was just overstuffed and under-functional. Even the dialog represents that, with Wolverine officially sounding like he's trying to be James Bond, all of the good lines taken straight from different works, some rather redundant lines like ""And that's why the pawns go first,"" and so on. I have no doubt in my mind that subsequent X-men will lose further sight of what makes the franchise good, and they're beginning their full decent here.

Yes, there are great special affects and storm(my favorite) finally gets a chance to fly, but she doesn't do much of anything else. I really expected storm to shine in this movie, but once again she left something to be desired. I guess I am expecting the characters to be more like the animated version of the x-men that aired on fox in the 90's. Another major flaw is having two main characters killed off. I mean come on folks, cyclops and the professor are key characters.And once again it's wolverine that saves the day. I don't have a beef against wolverine but having him take out a powerful mutant like the phoenix is just stretching it a little. I can see maybe the professor or magneto or maybe even storm, but wolverine. He gets way to much credit as far as I'm concerned. Magneto really shows his stuff in this one and so does Pyro,everyone else just sort of tags along for the ride. That is except for wolverine who always has to be the hero.

1012538,A2J04ZS8TD8OGR,B000HCO83G,"P. Soares ""Darkknightman""","[1, 2]","What a major disappointment this film turned out to be. The first two films in the series directed by Brian Singer were not necessarily accurate, but still had weight to them. This installment however brings nothing to the table but action scenes with no weight. Major characters are killed off with little fanfare leaving the viewing audience with the most uninteresting mutants to fight the final battle. Underdeveloped characters like Collossus, Roque, Angel, Kitty Pryde and Iceman step in to fight the final battle. But they are so underdeveloped that we just don't care what happens. The Phoenix storyline which should have been the focus, is reduced to a subplot. Magneto, who was somewhat sympathetic in the first two films, is reduced to a cackling villain who doesn't care about the very mutants he is sacrificing for. Note the line in the final battle where he states while mutants are falling in battle..and he says this smirking..""this is why the pawns go first"". This is so out of character from the first two films. Xavier also has a line that he delivers to Wolverine, ""I don't need to explain myself, least of all to you."" Why would he say that to Logan? Completely out of character.The final battle is so absurd. Magneto moves a bridge but can't bring a building down? And his master plan is to throw flaming cars at the X-men? That's it? FLAMING CARS? THE MUTANT WAR THAT WAS BUILDING UP CAME DOWN TO FLAMING CARS? And Jean Grey does nothing for most of the movie but watch. She kills Xavier and Cyclops without any remorse. This movie just plain sucked. For me personally the trilogy begins with X men Origins Wolverine. I know many people did not like it, but I thought it was pretty good. It wraps up with X2 as Logan's story comes full circle from Origins. X3 for me is not part of cannon. I wish Singer or someone else, anybody else would direct another X men film that ignores the events of X3. Or just start over.

I saw this movie yesterday evening, but it feels like I watched it a couple of years ago. X-Men: The Last Stand is oddly forgettable for a movie that kills off three major X-Men characters. Anyway, here's what I liked and didn't like about the third installment:The Good***I liked the scenes where Phoenix uses her powers.***I liked the fact that Storm got to use her powers more.***I think Ian McKellen did a good job as Magneto--I especially liked the scene on the highway where he saves Mystique.***Some of the special effects were good (like where Phoenix uses her powers)***I liked the concept of a mutant ""cure"" and what that implies about our own society's values.***I liked the fact that there were more mutants who used their powers--too bad they didn't have a very good reason for using them.***I liked Beast!***The last scene in the movie with Magneto playing chess gave me hope.The Bad***What's up with Storm's hair? It looks horrible. Storm is supposed to have long flowing white hair which looks cool when she uses her powers!***I didn't like the fact that the killing of one of the major characters was done off screen.***Rogue didn't use her powers at all in this movie.***The script sucks. Not enough story, not enough emotion, not enough DIALOGUE.***While the directing was excellent in some (meaning very few) scenes, it was mediocre for the most part.***The final battle needed to be longer and the final X-Men that dies also deserved a better exit.Overall, if you're one of those people who just has to see it, go see it! You might like it. The three other people I watched it with all agreed that this was the worst of the three movies, but from reading countless reviews here and elsewhere, some people actually liked it better than the first two movies. I guess it depends on what you want. I personally wanted more.While I own the other two movies, I'm not sure if this one is worth having.If the characters that died in this movie are meant to stay dead, then I don't see a need for another X-Men movie. If you check Hugh Jackman's profile on IMDB, one of the movies listed is Wolverine. I really don't see the need for a Wolverine movie since the first two movies were basically all about him. I also saw a Magneto movie listed under Ian McKellen's profile. While I think Ian is a great actor, do we really need a Magneto-only movie?In conclusion, I was disappointed in this film.

That having been said, I find the third installment to be the most entertaining of the lot - and that's some praise from one that thought the second film was excellent.This time out, there are so many characters (mutant and human) that it was obvious that some of the returning characters, like Anna Paquin (Rogue) and James Marsden (Cyclops) would have less screen time.  It is also obvious that Jackman, Berry, and McKellan are the stars, with Stewart doing nothing more than a ""death scene"" cameo.  As others have stated, Kelsey Grammer steals the show as ""Beast,"" with Vinnie Jones running a close second as ""Juggernaut"".It's also good to see stage, screen, and television Michael Murphy in the role of Warren Worthington II, creator of the ""cure"" for the mutant gene.The dialogue is equal to the second and superior to the first.  Special effects are outstanding, especially of Magneto shifting The Golden Gate Bridge and Dark Phoenix's (Famke Janssen) assault on Alcatraz in San Francisco Bay.The action is crisp and each actor does get his/her ""moment,"" no matter how brief.There are a few complaints: the absence of Jim Cummings' marvelous ""Nightcrawler"" and the beautiful Rebecca Romijn's early departure from the story line.  Both actors deserved better than this, after their impressive turns in the first two films.Also, the inevitable battle between ""Ice Man"" (Shawn Ashmore) and ""Pyro"" (Aaron Stafford) was a bit of a letdown, lasting less than a minute, in my estimate.That withstanding, if in fact this is the last in the series (save a Wolverine franchise), it still delivers and all that had a hand in its production have much for which they can be proud.",5,A fine send-off for the comic book-based franchise,1162598400,"11 4, 2006",2006,1814,"['one', ""n't"", 'have', 'knowledge', 'characters', 'comic', 'book', 'think', 'look', 'X-Men', 'film', 'less-biased', 'eye', 'having', 'been', 'said', 'find', 'third', 'installment', 'be', 'most', 'entertaining', 'lot', 'praise', 'one', 'thought', 'second', 'film', 'was', 'excellent.This', 'time', 'out', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'mutant', 'human', 'was', 'obvious', 'returning', 'characters', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'Rogue', 'James', 'Marsden', 'Cyclops', 'would', 'have', 'less', 'screen', 'time', 'also', 'obvious', 'Jackman', 'Berry', 'McKellan', 'are', 'stars', 'Stewart', 'doing', 'nothing', 'more', 'death', 'scene', 'cameo', 'others', 'have', 'stated', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'show', 'Beast', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'running', 'close', 'second', 'Juggernaut', '.It', 'also', 'good', 'see', 'stage', 'screen', 'television', 'Michael', 'Murphy', 'role', 'Warren', 'Worthington', 'II', 'creator', 'cure', 'mutant', 'gene.The', 'dialogue', 'equal', 'second', 'superior', 'first', 'Special', 'effects', 'are', 'outstanding', 'especially', 'Magneto', 'shifting', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', 'Dark', 'Phoenix', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'assault', 'Alcatraz', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Bay.The', 'action', 'crisp', 'actor', 'get', 'his/her', 'moment', 'matter', 'how', 'brief.There', 'are', 'few', 'complaints', 'absence', 'Jim', 'Cummings', 'marvelous', 'Nightcrawler', 'beautiful', 'Rebecca', 'Romijn', 'early', 'departure', 'story', 'line', 'actors', 'deserved', 'better', 'impressive', 'turns', 'first', 'two', 'films.Also', 'inevitable', 'battle', 'Ice', 'Man', 'Shawn', 'Ashmore', 'Pyro', 'Aaron', 'Stafford', 'was', 'bit', 'letdown', 'lasting', 'less', 'minute', 'estimate.That', 'withstanding', 'fact', 'last', 'series', 'save', 'Wolverine', 'franchise', 'still', 'had', 'hand', 'production', 'have', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'proud']",N/A

I wasn't such a fan of the first movie, but I did appreciate that the writers and producers couldn't cram ALL of the characterisation and development of the characters into one two-and-a-bit hour movie - and it was a pretty decent first effort, as franchise sci-fi goes.This movie, on the other hand, is just pretty flat, all things considered. And, even though it weighs in at a hefty running time and contains a number of potentially very entertaining plot elements, it's still just... well, just plain flat.The problem occurs with the script: Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn's screenplay contains surprisingly little dialogue; most of the movie feels like a segue from one special effects sequence to another. In an age where it's so obvious on a movie screen as to what's real and what's not, one would have thought that the writers might have focused a little more on the characters that have kept Marvel fans loyal for the last almost-fifty years. Alas no, and what we're sadly left with is a thin and perfunctory sort of movie, where the characters, at least via their characterisation, come across as two-dimensional and wooden.Acting's pretty average - Ian McKellen in Magneto's more powerful scenes looks like he's suffering from 'Mommie Dearest' syndrome, Patrick Stewart isn't given enough to do, and Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry do great jobs at looking either A. Angry or B. Blank. The one high point on the acting front for me was Kelsey Grammer in the role of Beast - during the penultimate battle scenes he comes across as a whole and likeable sort of character, compared to Jackman's incessant grunting or Berry's woeful whining.And that was another big problem - with a credited cast of many, many people, why did this movie become the Hugh and Halle Show??All in all, this was a big disappointment. It will appeal to the rabid fanboy element, but for fans of action and science fiction, it's nowhere near the fleshed-out fullness of, say, 'Batman Begins' or 'Episode III'.",2,Meh,1148601600,"05 26, 2006",2006,2013,"['*really*', 'liked', 'X-Men', '2', 'was', ""n't"", 'such', 'fan', 'first', 'movie', 'did', 'appreciate', 'writers', 'producers', 'could', ""n't"", 'cram', 'characterisation', 'development', 'characters', 'one', 'two-and-a-bit', 'hour', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'decent', 'first', 'effort', 'franchise', 'sci-fi', 'goes.This', 'movie', 'other', 'hand', 'just', 'pretty', 'flat', 'things', 'considered', 'even', 'hefty', 'running', 'time', 'number', 'potentially', 'very', 'entertaining', 'plot', 'elements', 'still', 'just', 'well', 'just', 'plain', 'flat.The', 'problem', 'script', 'Simon', 'Kinberg', 'Zak', 'Penn', 'screenplay', 'surprisingly', 'little', 'dialogue', 'most', 'movie', 'feels', 'segue', 'one', 'special', 'effects', 'sequence', 'age', 'where', 'so', 'obvious', 'movie', 'screen', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'not', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'writers', 'might', 'have', 'focused', 'little', 'more', 'characters', 'have', 'kept', 'Marvel', 'fans', 'loyal', 'last', 'almost-fifty', 'years', 'Alas', 'what', ""'re"", 'sadly', 'left', 'thin', 'perfunctory', 'sort', 'movie', 'where', 'characters', 'least', 'characterisation', 'come', 'two-dimensional', 'wooden.Acting', 'pretty', 'average', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Magneto', 'more', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'suffering', ""'Mommie"", 'Dearest', 'syndrome', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', ""n't"", 'given', 'enough', 'do', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'do', 'great', 'jobs', 'looking', 'A', 'Angry', 'B.', 'Blank', 'one', 'high', 'point', 'acting', 'front', 'was', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'role', 'Beast', 'penultimate', 'battle', 'scenes', 'across', 'whole', 'likeable', 'sort', 'character', 'compared', 'Jackman', 'incessant', 'grunting', 'Berry', 'woeful', 'whining.And', 'was', 'big', 'problem', 'credited', 'cast', 'many', 'many', 'people', 'why', 'did', 'movie', 'become', 'Hugh', 'Halle', 'Show', 'was', 'big', 'disappointment', 'will', 'appeal', 'rabid', 'fanboy', 'element', 'fans', 'action', 'science', 'fiction', 'nowhere', 'fleshed-out', 'fullness', 'say', ""'Batman"", 'Begins', ""'Episode"", 'III']",N/A

If you wish for surprises, do not read this review, if you don't mind knowing what happens or my opinion on it, then please read on.Jean is back... Mad as a hatter. Humans have developed a ""Cure"" for the ""Mutant problem,"" and... and...Well, as far as the plot goes, it isn't all that for such a highly anticipated movie. But not to fret, the title, ""The last stand"" refers to a point in the movie where the last of the X-men stand together to prevent the brotherhood from entering a facility, in other words, not only are they in the midst of working on the final X-men movie [X4], but the producers/creators are also thinking up of spin off movies [Wolverine the movie is being considered as of this date]. The X-men series is far from dead. Now that I've put you at ease about the title, and hope for the next movie, let me tell you about this one.Note: I've never been a fan of sequels, but X2 is one of the best sequels I've ever seen, since it introduced so many new mutants and left such a good storyline open with a few plot twists and blah blah blah. I really liked X2's imagination. X3 however...While watching the movie, I got the vibe after the first 15 minutes that this movie was made solely to flick off the characters who's actors just didn't want to be on the project [after such a poor run in X1, Cyclopes just never got back in the game... sadly he leaves us, and we never truly see him leave]. Don't get me wrong, watching Jean as a child in the first 5 minutes of the movie was great, but when she came back in a dazed state and scott is... obliterated... It just didn't really get any better than the first scene. [I did wonder why storm didn't go the way of the dodo seeing as how halle berry did put up a small fuss about it in the begining of production of this movie [but she signed on anyway]].Not only does cyclopse die, but so does patric stewart. Now, being a big fan of his, I was... appalled and more than a little disappointed when he left in the film, and I was more than just a little put out knowing Nightcrawler is NOT in this movie. But enough of what went wrong for me in the movie theatre; allow me to mention other points of the movie.Finally after much awaited time, Wolverine is not the center of attention [Sadly, no one really is in this film]. True they've strayed quite a bit from the cartoon's version of X-men, but it's still pretty nice. Ice man and pyro go in for a showdown, as does that girl who walks through walls, and Colossisiss... whatever the heck that metal man's name is, team up together as well as some other goodies. However, after the third installment of the movies, Gambit still has not come onto the scene. But in his place we've got a much more blue character who lightens one's face up whenever he comes onto the screen with his beautiful acting and wonderful dialogue... but, just as Yoda's 30 second light saber fight in episode II was the only good reason to see that film, they almost pulled the same thing here, as Beast's 10 second fight is pretty sweet to see. Thankfully, the acting is so much better than the star wars franchise, and there are a few more reasons to watch this film.With all that said, let me get back to Jean. She is... ""Reincarnated"" or something, they didn't really make that clear how she's still alive, however I will note that while watching her story unfold I suddenly smiled as a thought came to me as Xavier is ""Trying"" to explain what's going on with her,""They're making this up as they go along...""This was yet another vibe I got while watching the movie. I don't know about the rest of the public but I love plot lines and stories that provoke thought! The first X-men did this and mixed in enough action to leave one's eyes popping out for a sequel. X2 did an even better job and killed two birds with one stone, not only moving character pieces around the board, but also explaining wolverine a little better. X3 is little more than a bridge to X4 which hopefully... will be so the best of them all.Now I really liked X2 because you got to see alot more of every mutant's power, even if it was for a few seconds. They tried to do the same thing here but, with so much to look at, one finds that most of the so called ""Powers"" the mutants have in this movie just aren't as imaginative. In fact other than the main villains [Jugant ect ect], there are none that catch the eye, or are worth mentioning on this review. True, there are more villains with super powers out there, just none of them as good, or shown to be as good.Allow me to sum all this up.I give this film 2 stars for it's sheer lack of effort. I give it to the actors for being such good sports and though it does seem at times that they really are making up their own lines as they go, they still acted like their characters. Beast was really nice to look at, and of course Who can't wait to see Wolverine and Jean go at it in the lab room? Come on, be honest now...But frankly the story just wasn't cutting the mustard on this one, and with the excess of mutants, you never really did see alot of powers adequately. True there are a few good fighting scenes at the end of the movie, but not enough to warrant another star. X2 showed almost all of the powers for a bunch of little kids, why couldn't they do the same thing for a bunch of older meaner bad guys?I did not like that this movie had a flavour of, ""Let's get rid of some people today,"" throughout the movie, as well as if the writers were saying, ""Let's do this, even though there's no reason, but let's do it anyway."" Now, I could handle a few really good deaths that are dramatic, but most of the deaths were just plain ludicrous.NOTE: the movie ends with a small sliver of hope, but not enough to warrant a sequel. watch the movie through the credits so that you can have a glimmer of hope for what is to come.I am not bashing the acting, the directing or the special effects [Magneto moving the San Fran bridge is pretty cool to look at]. I'm just saying I expected more from a third installment from what seemed to be an almost better series than the current Spiderman films, however I'm just not so sure anymore with its lack of... Imagination and some key characters. Nightcrawler and Gambit, where'd they go?While this movie is entertaining the first time you watch it, you'll either love it or hate it. Out of all three X-men movies, X2 is the best so far, because the last stand is a step back.",2,Imagination...?,1150070400,"06 12, 2006",2006,6607,"['DISCLAIMER', 'review', 'spoilers', 'may', 'ruin',

Great plot, fantastic effects, but so far I have counted over 20 continuity errors, some major, some minor.Here's some samples: When Magneto and the doc are confronting Phoenix and it all hits the fan, the sliding doors are open. Next cut they are closed, and for the remainder of the scene. Yet when Wolfy is crawling along the ceiling towards the doors, they are open, close, open, closed.  Really sloppy editing there!When Magneto moves the bridge, it's the middle of the day. When the bridge hits land, minutes later, it's night.  All the vehicles were abandoned (except one) and tossed around like crazy, especially when Magneto clears the path through the cars.  Yet whenever we see the same section of bridge in distance shots..... 1) all the cars are in nice, neat rows. 2) All the car's headlights lights are on.  Neither is possible in the context of the movie, even ignoring the fact that day became night in under 5 minutes.Logan gets two gut injuries from the horn tossin' dude.  He heals. So does his t-shirt - because in the next scene, the holes are missing.When Logan is getting abused by Magneto at Alcatraz, he switches position between cuts. While lying down.

The previous film (X2 - X-Men United) did set the bar high, , but it did so not through the use of special effects, but instead by taking the time to build up the characters, making us involved in their struggles and losses on a personal level.X3, at a running time of 104 minutes, feels much shorter and compressed than X2 at 133 minutes. That missing 30 minutes makes all the difference. Characters die in this movie, while a few new ones are introduced...but its hard for us to be invested in things, either way, because any caring on the part of the characters seems to have been excised out of the story.What is our story, this time out? Without spoiling things, I can say that a pharmaceutical company has developed a ""cure"" for ""mutancy"". This causes consternation, to say the least, amongst the mutant population, which splits along the Xavier/Magneto lines, with Magneto wanting the so-called cure destroyed. Many of the X-Men (Xavier's crowd) are still mourning the loss of Jean Grey...and when Cyclops finds her again, all hell breaks loose.Seem like two independent storylines to you? Well, they are forced together, nearly midway through the film. One storyline is about the conformancy vs. not fitting in, and choice vs. force. The other is solely about power vs. responsibility. Well, if you're going to blend two different themes together, then you should take the time to do it right. Making a straight-out action flick, in which the characters barely have a moment to mourn the death of one of their two fallen comrades, is not the way to do it.So, colour me disappointed.

J Rey,"[2, 3]","Director Brett Ratner (Rush Hour 1 & 2) takes over the successful comic book franchise in the highly anticipated summer blockbuster ""X-Men: The Last Stand"". As tensions between humans and mutants continue to escalate, a ""cure"" for mutations grips an already unsettled mutant population. Now, opposing mutant leaders Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) clash for the ultimate battle that will ensure the future of all mutants. ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is an entertaining action-packed summer joyride that became one of the highest grossing films of 2006. The 108-minute Sci-Fi adventure lacks the strong emotive mood and rich character development of the first two films. The latest chapter in the ""X-Men"" series has a few emotionally touching moments, cool eye-popping visual effects, terrific action sequences and an appealing cast including Emmy winner Kelsey Grammer as the intelligent blue-haired Beast. Patrick Stewart, Halle Berry, Hugh Jackman and Ian McKellen deliver their share of memorable moments.Complete the trilogy with ""X-Men: The Last Stand"". The latest blockbuster sequel is presented in its theatrical 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The picture quality is somewhat weaker than previous X-Men DVDs but it is still a pretty sharp and brightly colored transfer. It's Dolby Digital and DTS audio tracks are the real highlights in this release and provide a top notch home theater experience.

Crawford,"[2, 5]","While I thought the second Xmen was not as good as the first, I found this one to match the standard of the first and even surpass it in some ways.  THe ending, I admit, is somewhat feel-good, but the death of some of the principal characters - one at her own request - make this something special, in the realm of truly excellent hard science fiction.  As such, while bringing out notions about American society with a theme of race and inclusiveness underneath, there is trajedy in these deaths.  Once again, the acting is simply spectacular, and the characters continue to evolve.  That makes this series outstanding, with a beginning and a potential end.Recommended with enthusiasm, even for fans of the comic.  I recognize many of the episodes of this from comics that are 25 years old, but changed into its own art.  You can view all three as a whole, and they completely entertained me on several successive nights.

1012564,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000HCO83G,Robert Moore,"[45, 55]","WARNING!  Spoilers ahead!I may be among the few who liked this one better than the previous two.  It probably was never going to be possible to create an X-Men finale that was going to please everyone.  I'll confess that there were a number of things in the three-film sequence that I didn't care for.  But give the team an ""A"" for effort in at least trying to do something interesting and compelling.  My complaint with the first film was that it was so safe and tame.  It didn't try to take the X-Men saga anywhere new or interesting.  THE LAST STAND did.  For the record, my complaint with the series is that it managed to make Rogue an unessential and uninteresting member of the team.  Of all the incarnations of Rogue, this one was the least powerful and the least complex.  Anna Paquin did a fine job given the script they provided, but she should have been far more empowered than she was.Most movies based on the comics suffer from a failure of nerve.  The writers want to play it safe, don't want to offend, and refuse to take risks.  THE LAST STAND takes a world of risks and leaves the X-Men universe shaken from top to bottom.  I loved that!  I didn't think all the gambles paid off.  The Phoenix story was not as interesting as it has been in the past.  Part of the problem with the Phoenix is that they tried to incorporate it with too many other arcs, including the ""cure"" of the mutant gene.Most of all, this film, unlike the previous two, really made me care how the story ended.  In the previous two, one figured everyone would be alive at the end, so in a way precisely what happened wouldn't matter all that much.  But in this one once Mystique had been ""cured"" and Scott and Xavier killed, there was a great sense of danger.  Not every one was going to emerge OK in this one.  Who would have imagined that the film would have ended with Xavier, Scott, and Jean dead, and Mystique, Magneto, and Rogue stripped of their powers?I loved the fact that they included some of the X-Men neglected in the previous films.  Kelsey Grammer was excellent as Hank McCoy, but I thought Ellen Page was perfect as Kitty Pryde, who has always been one of my favorite X-Men, mainly because her power of being able to pass through solid objects (or having solid objects pass through her) made her fascinating because employing it required so much strategy.  The sequence where she and Juggernaut engage one another was a lot of fun.  Vinnie Jones was almost unrecognizable, by the way, as Juggernaut.  Sidenote:  Many X-Men fans are bothered by the fact that traditionally Juggernaut is not a mutant.  Therefore, in the scene where his powers are stripped temporarily by the mutant who robs other mutants of their ability, he should have been unaffected.  But on narrative grounds I can understand why they altered this in the film.I can understand why so many fans of the comic disliked the final movie in the trilogy.  It was a sharp departure from most of the various versions of the X-Men saga found in so many of the comics and cartoon shows.  But I was ecstatic to see them try something really different and risky.  They didn't take the safe route.  And I personally found the story far more interesting than the first two films precisely for that reason.  Yeah, I wish Rogue had been conceived differently in the trilogy and I wish the Phoenix story had been handled better, but I realize that because there have been so many permutations of the X-Men, everyone is going to contruct their own private version.  This isn't quite the version I would have come up with had I the ability to cherry pick the elements I like, but this one managed the most important task:  it made the story interesting.",4,"Very controversial among X-Men fans, but I have to confess I really liked this one",1158451200,"09 17, 2006",2006,3707,"['WARNING', 'Spoilers', 'ahead', 'may', 'be', 'few', 'who', 'liked', 'one', 'better', 'previous', 'two', 'probably', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'be', 'possible', 'create', 'X-Men', 'finale', 'was', 'going', 'please', 'everyone', ""'ll"", 'confess', 'were', 'number', 'things', 'three-film', 'sequence', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'give', 'team', 'A', 'effort', 'least', 'trying', 'do', 'something', 'interesting', 'compelling', 'complaint', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'was', 'so', 'safe', 'tame', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'take', 'X-Men', 'saga', 'anywhere', 'new', 'interesting', 'LAST', 'STAND', 'did', 'record', 'complaint', 'series', 'managed', 'make', 'Rogue', 'unessential', 'uninteresting', 'member', 'team', 'incarnations', 'Rogue', 'one', 'was', 'least', 'powerful', 'least', 'complex', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'given', 'script', 'provided', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'empowered', 'was.Most', 'movies', 'based', 'comics', 'suffer', 'failure', 'nerve', 'writers', 'want', 'play', 'safe', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'offend', 'refuse', 'take', 'risks', 'LAST', 'STAND', 'world', 'risks', 'X-Men', 'universe', 'shaken', 'top', 'bottom', 'loved', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'gambles', 'paid', 'off', 'Phoenix', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'interesting', 'been', 'past', 'Part', 'problem', 'Phoenix', 'tried', 'incorporate', 'too', 'many', 'other', 'arcs', 'including', 'cure', 'mutant', 'gene.Most', 'film', 'previous', 'two', 'really', 'made', 'care', 'how', 'story', 'ended', 'previous', 'two', 'one', 'figured', 'everyone', 'would', 'be', 'alive', 'end', 'so', 'way', 'precisely', 'what', 'happened', 'would', ""n't"", 'matter', 'much', 'one', 'once', 'Mystique', 'had', 'been', 'cured', 'Scott', 'Xavier', 'killed', 'was', 'great', 'sense', 'danger', 'Not', 'one', 'was', 'going', 'emerge', 'OK', 'one', 'Who', 'would', 'have', 'imagined', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'Xavier', 'Scott', 'Jean', 'dead', 'Mystique', 'Magneto', 'Rogue', 'stripped', 'powers', 'loved', 'fact', 'included', 'X-Men', 'neglected', 'previous', 'films', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'was', 'excellent', 'Hank', 'McCoy', 'thought', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'was', 'perfect', 'Kitty', 'Pryde', 'who', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'X-Men', 'mainly', 'power', 'being', 'able', 'pass', 'solid', 'objects', 'having', 'solid', 'objects', 'pass', 'made', 'fascinating', 'employing', 'required', 'so', 'much', 'strategy', 'sequence', 'where', 'Juggernaut', 'engage', 'one', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'was', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'way', 'Juggernaut', 'Sidenote', 'Many', 'X-Men', 'fans', 'are', 'bothered', 'fact', 'traditionally', 'Juggernaut', 'not', 'mutant', 'Therefore', 'scene', 'where', 'powers', 'are', 'stripped', 'temporarily', 'mutant', 'who', 'other', 'mutants', 'ability', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'unaffected', 'narrative', 'grounds', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'altered', 'film.I', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'fans', 'comic', 'disliked', 'final', 'movie', 'trilogy', 'was', 'sharp', 'departure', 'most', 'various', 'versions', 'X-Men', 'saga', 'found', 'so', 'many', 'comics', 'cartoon', 'shows', 'was', 'ecstatic', 'see', 'try', 'something', 'really', 'different', 'risky', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'safe', 'route', 'personally', 'found', 'story', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'precisely', 'reason', 'Yeah', 'wish', 'Rogue', 'had', 'been', 'conceived', 'differently', 'trilogy', 'wish', 'Phoenix', 'story', 'had', 'been', 'handled', 'better', 'realize', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'many', 'permutations', 'X-Men', 'everyone', 'going', 'contruct', 'own', 'private', 'version', ""n't"", 'quite', 'version', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'had', 'ability', 'cherry', 'pick', 'elements', 'like', 'one', 'managed', 'most', 'important', 'task', 'made', 'story', 'interesting']",N/A

The new love triangle with Shadowcat, Iceman and Rogue?  Underdeveloped to a point that you just don't care.  And hey, they finally got Angel in the movies! ...and did nothing with him!

1012569,A2GXV3SMUHB7GB,B000HCO83G,"rogueshadowcrawler ""Rogue""","[7, 8]","First of all, I think this is a movie you have to watch two or three times to actually appreciate, since a lot of your experience the first time you watch it is ""BANG! BOOM! CRASH!"" In other words, this is an ACTION movie first and foremost, which means there isn't a lot of character development to speak of. Well, except for two specific characters. But I'll get to that in a minute.Now for what I LIKED about X3:-As screwed up as this version of Phoenix is, the Phoenix is my favorite X-Men villain, and I like the way it's been turned into an alternate personality of Jean's - it works, for the film. My personal favorite parts  were seeing her pupils dilate so much that her eyes were completely black (just an AWESOME touch, as far as I'm concerned) and the way you could kind of see a firey outline around her hair when she was backlit - it's probably an accident, but I like the subtle touch that only a diehard geek would get.-I really enjoy Shadowcat's character. In my first viewing I had no idea who she was, but then I found out more about her and now she's one of my favorite characters. Ellen Page played this version of her with a great mix of snarkiness and sensitivity.-Angel and Beast. Just seeing them onscreen, even with virtually no backstory, is cool.-Iceman iced up, an iconic moment. Let's hope in any future X-Men movies he'll do it again.-The Pyro vs. Iceman fight is a great bit, particularly since Iceman wins. (I've never been a big fan of Pyro, especially movie-Pyro, although I'll concede Aaron Stanford did a great job with the character.)-The big battle at the end is really great, visually.-FASTBALL SPECIAL. Even though it didn't look quite right since Hugh Jackman is too tall. But still, `nuff said.-The Danger Room is just cool-looking. And I loved the wink-wink-nudge-nudge reference to the Days of Future Past storyline.-About the only part that I liked of the Scott-Jean scene was when Jean held back Scott's optic blasts with her telekinesis. Another iconic moment from the comics, though naturally twisted to suit movie purposes.And what I DIDN'T like:-Storm's hair. I really don't get what they thought they were doing there. I mean, Storm doesn't have SHORT hair. She had a mohawk back in the 80's, but it's not the same thing.-I don't appreciate Kitty being shoved aside to be used mostly as the third part of a stupid love triangle that was basically pointless.-Colossus kind of didn't do anything except punch people and lug a big-screen TV around. He had more lines in X2, for crying out loud!-The Logan/Jean ""romance"" is played up WAY too much. I speak as a fan who hates that particular pairing, since I'm more of a traditionalist (IE Scott/Jean), but honestly. Watching them suck face in the medical ward is just awkward.-Mystique, who's never been my favorite but is a fascinating character, got depowered. Honestly, what was wrong with the screenwriters? They've just lost the appeal of half their male audience!...being serious now, I think they'll have a hard time doing X4 and beyond without Mystique in Magneto's group. And I was nursing a secret hope they'd do a reveal to Nightcrawler about who his mother REALLY is...-Lack of character development. Essentially, all we know about Beast is that he's blue and a government official. Not a good start, if you ask me. Angel is a little better, with the opening scene showing him as a young child trying to remove his wings before his disapproving father discovers them, but still lacking in dimension. And there's NO hint of Shadowcat's genius-level intelligence, other than a short conversation she has with Professor Xavier in the classroom early on, and you wouldn't pick that up unless you were looking for it.And what I absolutely HATED:-Jean's killing Scott. Why is this necessary? IT ISN'T. Now, I speak as a biased fan of Cyclops, even movie-Cyclops, who is less than stellar as far as his role goes. But this 15-minute role just makes me very angry. I understand James Marsden had little time to devote to this movie on account of filming Superman Returns simultaneously, but honestly, killing off the supposed leader of the X-Men in the first half-hour is just not something you do. I wish, at least, they'd had some sort of memorial for him, even a small MENTION of him during the Professor's funeral. But no. He just disappears from everyone's minds. This is an example of bad storytelling, children. I mean, what did the Phoenix do, EAT him??-Jean's killing the Professor. Now, I know he's not *really* dead, but I thought it was almost as stupid as killing off Scott. Honestly, in this movie THREE of the original X-Men characters, from the original team, are killed off. THREE. This, in my opinion, is inexcusable. And I don't just say that because the funeral makes me bawl like a baby every time I watch this movie either.-Rogue's dismissal from the script. No, seriously, they gave her about 15 lines, I think. Being the character who interested me in these stories in the first place, I'm extremely irritated that she got so little screentime. And THEN she got depowered. This angers me so much that I refuse to watch the original ending, where she returns depowered, and instead opt for the deleted scene where she still has her power. I understand where the writers and director were coming from with their decision to have her take the Cure - after all, she's essentially isolated from all physical contact - but I think it was one of the stupidest moves they could have made. How will they justify her staying at the Institute in future movies if she's powerless? Or will they just have the Cure stop working, like it appeared to with Magneto in the end, which will render her choice meaningless? Or will they just kick her out and have her leave, making it less likely that some fans will go see the movies because she's not in them? (I admit, I'll be one of those fans.) There is a very simple, temporary solution to Rogue's powers: LEECH. One of the producers talks about a scene that possibly would've been included in the movie had they chosen to have Rogue keep her powers, in which we see Rogue return and kiss Bobby, and then reveal Leech sitting outside the door with a Gameboy. I think this would've been a much better way of solving Rogue's problem while still keeping her powers for combat situations. But, no, apparently a depowered Rogue is a good Rogue.-The explanation for the lack of character development: this became ""The Wolverine and Jean Show"" (as opposed to ""The Wolverine and Rogue Show"" that was the first two movies). Roughly 85% of the screentime was devoted to Wolverine, and Jean, or Wolverine AND Jean, which annoyed me. The title is X-MEN, not LOGAN AND JEAN. Meaning the movies are supposed to be about a GROUP. But, no, they decided to focus on those two instead and move everybody else to the backburner.Overall, I watch this movie for the excellent special effects and action sequences, but I can't recommend it to a diehard fan of the comics on basis of the deaths of three pivotal characters (as well as two others being depowered) and lack of character development. But it's a great wiz-bang action flick, if you like that sort of thing.

1012570,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000HCO83G,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 6]","**1/2In the first two ""X-Men"" films, perceptive viewers could easily detect the ""pro-gay rights"" subtext that ran through the storyline about a race of superpower ""mutants"" let loose on the world and the debate over their place in society.  The latest installment, ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" takes the issue a step further by proposing a complex moral dilemma: should the ""mutants"" be encouraged to partake of a supposed ""cure"" for their condition or should they be proud of who they are and not change merely to placate a society made uncomfortable by their presence?Unfortunately, even though ""The Last Stand"" raises this intriguing ethical issue, it really doesn't do anything all that interesting with it.  The main problem is that the screenplay simply fails to come up with a character commensurate with the movie's theme.  In fact, there are so many mutants running around that none of them is ever able to grab the center of the movie's attention or the focus of the audience.  Storm, Wolverine, Phoenix, Iceman, Rogue etc. all have their individual moments but they are soon crushed under the weight of overblown actions scenes and over-the-top special effects.  Only Ian Holm's evil Magneto has a chance to break through all the pyrotechnics and create some impact as a character.I loved the original ""X-Men"" when it came out in 2003 precisely because it felt so bold and daring in its willingness to explore social issues along with all the CGI effects, stunt work and explosions that are par for the action film genre.  But the two follow-up editions have not lived up to those expectations.

I hope it's not really their Last Stand.Briefly, we dealt with Death and Resurrection, concerning Jean Grey (Phoenix), Cyclops & Professor X.We see some early insights into the power of Jean Grey. We see more insights into the romantic tensions between Jean Grey and Wolverine.A good element of the story is the invention of a ""cure"" for the mutants. They will allegedly be allowed to choose whether or not they want the cure. But you just have to know the government is likely to take that choice away.Magneto gathers his Evil Mutants to fight the ""normal"" people who have created the cure. This involves moving the Golden Gate bridge to allow them to move to Alcatraz Island.Some of my favorite X-men return in this movie, and many new ones are introduced. One of my favorites is Kelsey Grammar (Frazer) as the Beast. It is such a great match.The biggest problem with this movie is the abundance of characters, in the X-men and the Evil Mutants. So many characters get only a few moments to shine.Again, I think this is a result of a valiant effort to cover the wide range of characters and changes over the past 40+ years of the X-men's history.My biggest regret was that I didn't see this in a theater...

1012579,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000HCO83G,Samuel McKewon,"[1, 1]","""The Last Stand"" is the first in the ""X-Men"" series to truly embrace its pulpy comic book roots. It's a fun action picture that sets up its pins and knocks them down without pretending each demise needs its own aria to accompany it. This development may disgust the purists who devoured comic books like every other kid, then decided in their twenties to reimagine those mindless hours as advanced lessons in sociopolitical ethics.Not that director Brett Ratner, taking over for Brian Singer, completely drops the hot-button issues at play in ""X2."" He merely dials down the portentious weight of them. Xavier(Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) are still at odds. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) still marches to his own drum. Storm (Halle Berry) still has nothing to do. Rogue (Anna Paquin)is still weird. And the U.S. government is still looking for an answer to the mutant question, and this time it presents a pretty interesting one: Using the DNA of a boy called Leech (Cameron Bright) to eradicate the mutant gene completely. Though ""the cure"" is optional, Magneto, now a fugitive, sees it as an entryway to a final solution, and intends to stop the production entirely.Shoehorned into this storyline is the resurrection of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) as the Dark Phoenix, whose telekinetic powers dwarfs the skills of anyone else, including Xavier, who locked the Phoenix away in Jean's mind when she was a girl. The disaster at the end of ""X2"" - in which Jean sacrificed her own life to save the X-Men jet - cocooned Jean in the water but destroyed the mental barriers (How? Who knows?). Cyclops (Scott Marsden)revives her. But it's not the same girl who went into that water.Besides Jean, ""The Last Stand"" slips a few jokers into its deck. One death is unforeseen, as is one betrayal, and one of the X-Men is hot for the cure. Ratner mostly pulls off the large action sequences, including the 30-minute finale at Alcatraz that begins with Magneto's rerouting of the Golden Gate bridge and ends with a showdown between two lovers.Unlike Singer, who allows his movies to be edited within an inch of their life, Ratner lets his camera breathe a little. The special f/x aren't as glossy and the lighting isn't as dramatic - the movie looks more like a lush, inky Spielberg picture than the study in primary colors of ""X-Men"" and ""X2""  The screenplay by Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn may lack eloquence, but it also isn't so stilted - no Nightcrawler reciting the Lord's Prayer. ""The Last Stand"" explores the mutants without subjecting them to low-level Shakespeare. Even Kelsey Grammer, who could have turned mutant government official Beast into a Professor Xavier clone, delivers a zestful, light performance.

1012581,A3BRVQ5J0LAUU2,B000HCO83G,Sarah,"[0, 0]","I think the biggest problem with this installment, as many have pointed out, is that it was just a showcase for how awesome mutant powers look when put onscreen. Virtually all of the characters that were developed in-depth and made the first two movies great were either killed off or missing-in-action for most of the movie.Logan, Ororo, Jean, and Magneto were some of the only ones who got enough attention. It was speculated Scott got so little screen time because James Marsden had other projects to work on. He was probably on the promotional poster just to get people to see the movie, even though he didn't even have time to get in his costume in the film. And I have no idea why Rogue was hardly present, other than the fact that maybe it was decided that her powers wouldn't add any POW to the movie. I have also read that Nightcrawler was written out completely because there would be too many ""blue"" characters, but I really hope there was a more valid one. Kitty and Colossus are actually two of my absolute favorites, but their treatment in the film was the same as generally every other mutant we saw, which was, essentially ""look at the cool powers!"". And, of course, Angel and Beast finally made it so the original X-men had appeared in the movie, but they also had roles that were sadly lacking.As a fan of the comics, I tried my ass off not to be disappointed as the deaths of several main characters, because in the X-men Universe, people dying and being ressurected multiple times is not uncommon. So I assume they did this to simplify the movie, and killing beloved characters is a very good way to amp up the feeling in a film. And if this was supposed to be the final installment, killing the characters is certainly a way to make sure that no one comes along and makes another one. I can't decide if the open ending was to hint that there might be another movie in the future, or just to piss me off.The high points were there, too, though, namely the special effects were, obviously, awesome. And the story itself wasn't bad...the biggest problem was the character treatment.

The character development is hurried, the plot is thin, and there just seems to be a feeling of.....rushed work throughout.  How much of this should be planted on the director, Brett Ratner, is questionable.  He seems to have a respect for the work done previously by Bryan Singer, and when he's allowed to play with his favorite tools - action sequences - he shines.  Ratner's weaknesses are also prominently displayed - character development was never his forte, and this is coming from someone who LIKED his turn on ""Red Dragon.""  So who is to blame for the bad stuff?With the above mentioned sense of rushed work, I guess I have to pin the blame on the man-who-wasn't-there, namely Bryan Singer.  There are rumors, with strong hints of being facts, that he bailed on this project in the middle of pre-production to work on ""Superman Returns.""  If this is indeed true, it shows.  ""X-Men, The Last Stand"" has the feeling of being script-doctored in mid-stream - that is, they had most of one man's vision in the can, but then needed another man to finish it as close to man one's vision as possible.  What we have left is just hints of what made the X-Men movie francise so great - real-world issues of prejudice and isolation - mixed with insanely maxed-out action that is the hallmark of another person, resulting in something that isn't exactly great, but isn't exactly bad either.  It's just.....frustratingly inconsistent.What works...action, action, action.  If we hadn't the first two ""X-Men"" flicks, this would've been a happily decent popcorn movie.  Kelsey Grammar was way cool as Beast.  I hate to say it, but the deaths were poignant - let's face it, even Singer and his scriptwriters were having a difficult time making Scott Summers interesting - and  added some needed gravitas to the story.The rest of the film?  A bit undone by the deux-ex-machina endings (yes, it's true; you need to sit through the credits for a feel-good surprise that will give any amatuer or professional film person a reason for remembering ""Mise-En-Scene"") and there really are WAY too many characters to keep count of.  Finally, there's the highly (even by comic book standards) implausible six-on-one-hundred-thousand ""Alamo Defense"" at the film's climax that will just plain leave you scratching your head.But, and this is important, it's still an enjoyable little action film because it's a comic-book action film.  It doesn't have to be completely plausible.  It's nice to see our heroes prevail over (ridiculously high) adversity.  And not every part of a francise will be an out-of-the-ballpark winner.  Anyone remember Joel Schumacher's ""Batman And Robin""?  Does ""X-Men, The Last Stand"" look THAT atrocious by comparison?

1012586,A36DX09DL7EWTF,B000HCO83G,Scotty NYC,"[1, 1]","I loved the first two movies. Exciting, great effects, cool characters, terrific stories... then you come to that 'awkward third album'... And yes it is awkward. But not a disaster by any reckoning. The story is good, the effects better than ever, the characters dynamic. So what's the problem? They simply try to squeeze too much in. There are loads of new characters, all demanding their air time, with the result that there simply isn't enough time for everyone to get a decent crack at things. It would've been far better so cut some of the minor characters to give the leads more time. Plus, some of the editing decisions are VERY questionable. For example, the battle at Jean Grey's house involving Wolverine and Storm... well, in the movie, it looks like they lose it to me. Not what you expect from your heroes. BUT... stick on the extra features and see the extended scene, however, and you get a very different picture. And a far, far superior scene. The finale has some similarly baffling editing.So, when the action scenes are questionable, and the main characters don't get enough screen time, is it any wonder the movie didn't come up to expectations?All this said, it's still a great movie. Not a triumph, but a worthy addition to the franchise.",4,A slight disappointment... but only slight,1177718400,"04 28, 2007",2007,1260,"['loved', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'Exciting', 'great', 'effects', 'cool', 'characters', 'terrific', 'stories', 'then', 'come', ""'awkward"", 'third', 'album', 'yes', 'awkward', 'not', 'disaster', 'reckoning', 'story', 'good', 'effects', 'better', 'ever', 'characters', 'dynamic', 'what', 'problem', 'simply', 'try', 'squeeze', 'too', 'much', 'are', 'loads', 'new', 'characters', 'demanding', 'air', 'time', 'result', 'simply', ""n't"", 'enough', 'time', 'everyone', 'get', 'decent', 'crack', 'things', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'far', 'better', 'so', 'cut', 'minor', 'characters', 'give', 'leads', 'more', 'time', 'editing', 'decisions', 'are', 'VERY', 'questionable', 'example', 'battle', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'house', 'involving', 'Wolverine', 'Storm', 'well', 'movie', 'lose', 'Not', 'what', 'expect', 'heroes', 'BUT', 'stick', 'extra', 'features', 'see', 'extended', 'scene', 'however', 'get', 'very', 'different', 'picture', 'far', 'far', 'superior', 'scene', 'finale', 'similarly', 'baffling', 'editing.So', 'when', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'questionable', 'main', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'wonder', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'expectations', 'said', 'still', 'great', 'movie', 'Not', 'triumph', 'worthy', 'addition', 'franchise']",N/A

There are events and actions in the movie that totally betray not only the first two films, but in and of themselves do nothing to advance the plot of the movie. Others are completely inexplicable. I'm going to phrase these events in a series of ""WHY"" questions.1. Why was Alkali Lake covered in a fog so dense when Wolverine and Storm arrived that they couldn't even see each other? Did this advance the plot somehow or make the floating rocks seems that much more dramatic because they were hidden or was it an attempt to have Halle Berry get more ""I am powerful; look at me act"" time?2. Why did Jamie Maddrox join Magneto? Poor guy was locked up in a solid metal box and missed Magneto whole speech about Mutant Freedom but his first words after ebing freed were not ""Who are you and how did you get me out of this prison?"" but rather ""I'm in! Sign me up!"" How did he know what he was signing up for or if signing up was even an option?3. Why didn't someone tell Juggernaut he was wearing a melted tin can on his head?4. Why couldn't Magneto keep his character straight? This guy changed his tune and his rationales every few seconds. Is he saddened by Charles' death or is he happy that the competition is gone? He's against the cure but has no problem declaring that ""Any mutant who stands in our way, we will use the cure against them!"" He abandons Mystique in a government prison vehicle after she's changed to a human and doesn't even suspect that she (as his right-hand mutant) would be pissed enough to give him up to the said government. Set aside for a moment that Mystique rescued him in X2, shouldn't he, as a Holocaust survivor, have had pity towards her instead of blaming the victim?5. Why was that crappy Phoenix origin allowed to go forward? And why after Bryan Singer (who needs to marry me) took such loving care to give use the Phoenix as the closing image of X2 was there not even a HINT of fire around Jean in this movie?6. Why did twenty minutes elapse in the movie before anyone even started asking questions or speculating about what happened to Scott? Moreover, why did Professor X (who died AFTER Scott did (ostensibly - we never saw Scott's body)) have a funeral AND a gravestone AND an eternal flame burning while Scott had NOTHING to mark his death, not even a gravestone? (It begs the question here to ask ""Why did Scott die?"")7. Why the coarse language, up to and including the legendary and completely inappropriate, ""I'm the Juggernaut, BITCH!!!""8. Why did Professor X say to Logan, ""I warned you.""? When did this warning happen? In what way was Jean's waking up and dry humping Wolverine not only HIS FAULT but also something Prof X warned him about?9. Why did Magneto use his powers to turn a simple doorknob?10. When Magneto tells Juggernaut, ""No one gets in (to the Grey residence),"" why does Juggernaut throw Wolverine in through the window during their fight?11. Why did Kitty say she missed home and the ""first snow (of Chicago)""? She lives in Westchester, NY!!! It snows there ALL the time!!! It's not like they moved the mansion to Boca Raton.12. Why did Jean look lobotomized the whole time? Yes, the Dark Phoenix effect to her face was the highlight of the movie, but it only happened twice. Where is her ""rage"", her ""passion"" that Magneto spoke of? And really why was she with Magneto? If someone had give her a line like, ""You're beneath me, but this drama may be of some amusement. So, play on, little ants but God help you if you bore me."" (yeah, ok, that;'s bad...), but SOMEthing to explain why she just stood there.13. What was it about the Angel that resolved Storm to keep the school open after she three seconds before basically was locking the doors? Aren't ALL the students in need of a safe place? (yeah, I know , that's a ""what"" question)14. When Magneto announces that ""enough mutant blood has been spilt already"" as a threat to the human.. uhm, the last incident of violence against mutants was Pyro blowing up a clinic for mutant wanting the cure. It was a very President Bush thing to do.15. WHY OH WHY did Magneto have to move the entire Golden Gate Brige to get to Alcatraz? Was it so he could say the line, ""Charles always did want me to build bridges?"" Why not just make a metal disk for everyone to fly over on? He did it in X2. I kow it's the ""money shot"" so to speak - the opening declaration of war on th\e humans, but it lacked the finesse I've come to expect form Magneto.16. Why did the sun take about 3 seconds to set?17. Why did Rogue disappear for the second half of the movie?18. How did Warren manage to fly from NY to SF only about 20 minutes behind the X-Jet? And why did Warren who from all descriptions hated his wings, suddenly decide to keep them? (right - a ""how"" question :))19. Why did Leech just suddenly disappear from the movie? What happened to him?20. And finally (another ""how"" question) HOW OH HOW did mutants and humans suddenly become friends again after all those horrible deaths on Alcartraz?? The end was right up there with Starship Troopers - thousands of people dead, their best friends eaten or used as bug incubators, an entire way of life almost destroyed and the closing line ON THE BATTLEFIELD is ""Good things happen when the three of us are together!"" WTF?If someone can help me with answers here, I'd love to hear them. I'm sad. I mean actually, physically let down and saddened by the movie. AND before I hear the words ""fanboy"" and ""thirty years of history"" and ""canon"", let me say I know that to do the ""fundie literalist"" version of the Phoenix story would have been impossible BUT Bryan Singer departed from the ""mainstream"" X-Men story so it IS possible to do a good movie without slavishly following the text. My point is that this doesn't even follow the continuity of the previous two movies nor does it follow its own continuity.About the DVD itself, the 10 delected scenes are all under 20 seconds each (most under 10) and the three alternate ending have nothing to do with Phoenix, but are rather ""alernate closings"" - the final image of the movie as the music swells and the lights come up.  All very disappointing.argh...",1,because i can't give it zero stars....,1160092800,"10 6, 2006",2006,6214,"['could', 'pick', 'one', 'word', 'decribe', 'X3', 'would', 'be', 'unmotivated', 'are',

It all boils down to this... great special effects, but with their budget this was expected; visually appealing fight scenes, but with this director it was expected; decent attempt at a plot, the cure was an excellent idea and could have been a wonderful vehicle to introduce the mutant wars, but that fell short; horrible character development, in fact it was as if the screenwriter knew nothing of the X-Men besides their powers... they got everyone wrong, wrong, wrong.In the end, this movie will be liked by a lot of people who know nothing of the comics, but most everyone who liked X-Men because they knew the comics will HATE this movie.  Its almost as though Fox rushed this movie to get back at Brian Singer for directing Superman and ended up with a movie that had a lot of people wishing the end would show Professor X waking up in bed realizing everything you just saw was some alternate reality turned nightmare.See it if you like effects, stay home if you like the X-Men.",2,And just where were the X-Men in this movie?,1148601600,"05 26, 2006",2006,1156,"[""'ll"", 'try', 'not', 'write', 'spoilers', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'movie', 'coherent', 'plot', 'Fox', 'just', 'killed', 'off', 'biggest', 'blockbuster', 'catalog', 'down', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'budget', 'was', 'expected', 'visually', 'appealing', 'fight', 'scenes', 'director', 'was', 'expected', 'decent', 'attempt', 'plot', 'cure', 'was', 'excellent', 'idea', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'wonderful', 'vehicle', 'introduce', 'mutant', 'wars', 'fell', 'short', 'horrible', 'character', 'development', 'fact', 'was', 'screenwriter', 'knew', 'nothing', 'X-Men', 'powers', 'got', 'everyone', 'wrong', 'wrong', 'wrong.In', 'end', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'liked', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'nothing', 'comics', 'most', 'everyone', 'who', 'liked', 'X-Men', 'knew', 'comics', 'will', 'HATE', 'movie', 'almost', 'Fox', 'rushed', 'movie', 'get', 'back', 'Brian', 'Singer', 'directing', 'Superman', 'ended', 'up', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'people', 'wishing', 'end', 'would', 'show', 'Professor', 'X', 'waking', 'up', 'bed', 'realizing', 'everything', 'just', 'saw', 'was', 'alternate', 'reality', 'turned', 'like', 'effects', 'stay', 'home', 'like', 'X-Men']",N/A
1012589,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,B000HCO83G,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[0, 1]","X3: The Last stand is the Last Straw for Shawn James. The X- trilogy comes to a horrid finish under the lens of the inept Brett Ratner. Brett Ratner is to X-men what Joel Schumacher is to Batman. In ten years people will be denouncing this X-Trilogy the same way they do the first Batman Saga. Unfortunately, there won't be a Chris Nolan and David Goyer or a Sam Raimi around to rectify the mistake this time.Ratner makes a total 360 from what little story Bryan Singer tried to build in his first two films. The convoluted plot involves a ""Cure"" for mutation, the Pheonix, rising from the ashes, and a war. Each of these stories would make for a great movie in and of themselves, but Ratner throws them in a blender and makes one big mess. There are too many stories, too many characters and no focus. But Storm needs more screen time, the studio needs Halle, and Ratner just uses CGI special effects to patch up the plotholes and totally derive from the course of the comics being adapted. In the first ten minutes Ratner uses the Phoenix to Kill off Cyclops and Professor X, characters crucial to the X-Saga. I guess this is so Storm can be leader and have more screen time. Thank you Miss Halle Berry. Someone in your entourage should advise you this old Broadway adage: THERE ARE NO SMALL PARTS ONLY SMALL ACTORS. It's not how much screen time you have, but what you do with it. Sadly she gives the same flat uninspired performance she does in every movie post Swordfish.Due to Halle's insecure need for more screen time, Ratner's incompetent directing and Fox's need to beat WB's Superman Returns at the box office, X3 falls completely apart over the course of 90 odd minutes. Ironically, these three political forces behind the camera sabotage the intriguing political stories in the movie. The movie strays way off course from the comic storylines it's adapted from and heads into Batman and Robin territory. In the comics, Jean who loved Cyclops so much she held back the evil Phoenix force and sacrificed her own life, Kills the man she loves with impunity. Wolverine loved Jean so much he couldn't bear to kill her. But in this movie he slaughters her with ease. But this change of story course from the comics is nothing compared to the numerous strays from the original two movies. Rogue who struggles and deals with her inability to touch others by finding another way to connect with them (emotionally), just cops out with a wonder drug. Iceman just decides to date Kitty Pryde because it's convenient to the plot. During the big battle sequence, Magneto abandons a cured Mystique, his loyal lieutenant of two movies. Six X-men take on an army of morlocks so storm can get her big battle sequence. And Magneto, the brilliant military strategist doesn't have enough sense to throw a force field around himself while Six X-men are shooting ""cure"" darts allover the place. Hey, he always keeps a magnetic force field around him in the comics, but in this movie he just decides not to. And when the war is all done, thousands of lives lost, billions in property damage, both sides shake hands and back to business as usual with a Don't ask, Don't tell policy. But these plot points don't matter. It's a necessary compromise so Storm gets more screen time.When you think about this movie it truly is the ""Wolverine and Storm"" of the X-Franchise a complete and unmitigated disaster. The entire movie feels rushed and sloppy; it seems like Fox just wanted to get a product out before Superman Returned; quality be damned. The acting is flat and one-dimensional because characters aren't' written with any depth. To cover up the bad acting and bad writing, Ratner overloads the movie with special effects. Yes, the special effects are dazzling; seeing the Golden Gate Bridge torn apart is amazing. But there's no story behind them and no build up to that big final sequence to make us care.

The X-Men Last Stand, the Phoenix saga on the big screen...  something a fan of the early Chris Claremont / John Byrne comic books have dreamed about but then it came out. I understand that things change for a movie, they have to make the transition to the big screen but this movie took a meat cleaver to the canon of X-men. The first two movies understood how to make a movie and appease fans of the comic.  Singer was obviously a fan of the original material.  Those earlier movies made some characters that were adults, adolescents; they switch things around but it still rung true.  This movie, however, trounced what had made the original great.  Where Cyclops was a main player in the comic he was cast aside, too insignificant to even show his death.  Where the Phoenix was a messed up girl who struggled with her remaining humanity was instead portrayed as a zombie who would just as soon disintegrate you as look at you.  Angel one of the original X-Men a throw away, the addition of Kitty Pryde was never explained, she just appeared, and so much more.True there were some great special effects, and Magneto had a few moments but the lack of love of the project was obvious.  Notice in the Golden Gate bridge scene that started out in the day then suddenly it was night...  or how quickly everyone got over a character's death.  This was a HACK job and I wish we could have a do over since I had been a fan of the early story and now I am left with my favorite character's in a shambles.  They killed charaters off maybe due to actors contract rather then if they should die.For those of you who do not read the comics, or care about the inner details of the story I am sure this is a fine movie.

The Last Stand is appreciably different than the two previous installments due primarily to it featuring a different director, and secondarily because they continue to introduce more characters from the series. This does make it markedly more difficult to maintain focus. The original X-Men comic books took years to move through the same story arc. This was evident while viewing this film. The story seemed fractured because there were so many sub-plots. It was almost like there was a bunch of different movies cut and put together. The forays into the characters we forgot we were supposed to care about are forgettable, and could easily have been cut. However, it was an entertaining film throughout with great acting and spectacular effects. The battle scenes were bigger than the last two films because the mutants moved from the underground to do battle out in the open. I really don't know what else to say. Now that I'm actually writing this down, the movie wasn't all that great. It was a lot of fun to watch, but it could have been much better. The effects tried to compensate for the weaknesses elsewhere, but even the giant finale battle was sort of aloof. We were sort of detached from what was actually going on, and I felt it was more of an atmosphere of battle than actual action. I think as a package of three films - the X-Men trilogy - everything would be really cool. I enjoyed it, I really liked it, but it is far from being the pinnacle of movie making - even at comic book standards.",3,Failure of a finale,1181606400,"06 12, 2007",2007,1624,"['supposedly', 'last', 'X-Men', 'series', 'go', 'more', 'focused', 'films', 'Magneto', 'Wolverine', 'Last', 'Stand', 'appreciably', 'different', 'two', 'previous', 'installments', 'due', 'primarily', 'featuring', 'different', 'director', 'secondarily', 'continue', 'introduce', 'more', 'characters', 'series', 'make', 'markedly', 'more', 'difficult', 'maintain', 'focus', 'original', 'X-Men', 'comic', 'books', 'took', 'years', 'move', 'same', 'story', 'arc', 'was', 'evident', 'viewing', 'film', 'story', 'seemed', 'fractured', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'sub-plots', 'was', 'almost', 'was', 'bunch', 'different', 'movies', 'cut', 'put', 'together', 'forays', 'characters', 'forgot', 'were', 'supposed', 'care', 'are', 'forgettable', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'However', 'was', 'entertaining', 'film', 'great', 'acting', 'spectacular', 'effects', 'battle', 'scenes', 'were', 'bigger', 'last', 'two', 'films', 'mutants', 'moved', 'underground', 'do', 'battle', 'open', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'else', 'say', 'Now', ""'m"", 'actually', 'writing', 'down', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'effects', 'tried', 'compensate', 'weaknesses', 'elsewhere', 'even', 'giant', 'finale', 'battle', 'was', 'sort', 'aloof', 'were', 'sort', 'detached', 'what', 'was', 'actually', 'going', 'felt', 'was', 'more', 'atmosphere', 'battle', 'actual', 'action', 'think', 'package', 'three', 'films', 'X-Men', 'trilogy', 'everything', 'would', 'be', 'really', 'cool', 'enjoyed', 'really', 'liked', 'far', 'being', 'pinnacle', 'movie', 'making', 'even', 'comic', 'book', 'standards']",N/A

Seeing that Magneto is prepairing for war against the human race the president releases the Sentinel project to take out Magneto's forces only to have most of the Sentinels distroyed by The Phoenix.

Iceman and Rouge are having relationship problems. Iceman is falling for Kitty Pride and Rouge finds herself falling for the new kid in class.

The Phoenix is very well portrayed by the gorgeous Famke Janssen, when she gets mad her face appears alien and terrifying (hats off to the cgi team) and her powers exceed all others (which makes sense since full strength telekinises WOULD give her an advantage against anyone else).I also liked the deaths which occurred, it was good to see the back of cyclops whose laser beam talent was never effectively dealt with by the filmmakers over the three films and whose constant grumpiness was a turnoff. Xavier was always interesting in the series yet it is good when a director is not afraid to kill off the major characters. I wish they had not killed the Phoenix off the way they did though, then again she IS the Phoenix and if there is a new film she may be back!I agree with another reviewer that maybe Storm should have been the one pitted against the Phoenix, but would telekinesis affect lightning?Ian Mckellan puts in a good performance as the twisted Magneto, we see him all holds barred here, throwing bridges and cars around like they were toys and Pyro is an eye catcher as the human flamethrower. I still think Magneto and Pyro should have been able to wipe the floor with the opposition in the showdown at the end... I also think that some of the new villains were not interesting enough, their clothes and attitudes and powers were too similiar and perhaps the director tried to introduce too many new mutants overall, i mean... was Angel really necessary?

But this was disappointing. It was the perfect example of Hollywood taking a perfectly good series and crapping on it because they want to rush through a summer blockbuster. They changed the director. They changed the head writer. You got to ask yourself why the hell would they do that? I mean the writer was the writer for American Pie for god sakes. The answer was that the director was doing Superman Returns and wanted to finish it before moving on to the next project. The studio told him to stick it, they didn't want to wait, so they pushed a new director through.

1012600,A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000HCO83G,S. Rhodes,"[4, 6]","The first X-Men movie was, in my opinion, not a fantastic movie at all.  I'm no comic book junkie, but I'm a movie lover.  So of course, my expectations of X-Men weren't really balanced when I went to see the first movie.  It disappointed overall, and so I thought X2 would be just as bad.  To my surprise, X2 was astounding.  Perhaps one of the best Superhero movies ever made.  It had action, characterization, and overall good plot and story.  Even people who aren't X-Men fans could get into X2.  X2 still ranks as one of the finest comic book adaptations out there.Now we get to X-Men: The Last Stand.  Brett Ratner directed this one, and I won't say he did a terrible job.  I will say however, that The Last Stand doesn't hold a candle to X2: X-Men United. Let us clear up one little misunderstanding: This is not the last X-Men movie.  People will think so because it's called ""The Last Stand"" but it isn't the last in the movie franchise (which may be why they put that little extra after the credits).There is now a ""cure"" for the mutant gene.  Mutants have a choice as to whether or not they can take this cure.  Some mutants are thrilled by the chance to finally be ""normal"" others are outraged and crying out that there doesn't need to be a cure at all.  Even worse, the government has been manufactoring the cure into a weapon without saying anything to the nation.  And when Magneto finds out, all hell breaks loose.  Unless the government eradicates ""the cure"" Magneto promises a war.  And he delivers.But Magneto's war isn't the only thing going on in this film.  Cyclops is mourning Jean's death, but later comes to discover that Jean isn't dead.  In more revelations, Xavier admits that Jean is the most powerful mutant out there.  Except now Jean can't control her powers.  Her powers seem to control her.  The X-Men now have two problems on their hand.  A war that's about to break out, and dealing with class five mutant that's more powerful than anyone could possibly imagine.  And as Magneto's war carries on, the two problems soon merge into one massive disaster.It's hard to talk about the movie without providing a few spoilers.  New faces come on board for the newest installment of the franchise, but at the same time, a few have left.  For example: Nighcrawler isn't in the movie at all, and they don't even bother to explain where he went.  He's just gone. The new characters that come about though, are not in huge numbers.  Most of them join up with Magneto.When it comes to the characters in this film, however, there are a few things that urk me.  Old characters are changed.  We all know Wolverine used to be a tough guy who went at everything his own way.  He maintains going at things his own way, but his persona seems to have changed.  He's not ruthless and willing to stand at fight the way he used to.  It's a little distracting, considering what he went through to save those he cared about in the second movie.  Even worse, old characters get nothing to enhance the development started in the previous two films.  The new characters that come about get no development at all.  This is unforgiveable to those who enjoyed the character driven story of the second movie.  Here, it seems to be about the incredible special effects rather than the characters.  There's a lot of emphasis on what goes on around the characters rather than what's actually happening to them, and that's sad to admit.The characters don't just suffer in terms of development, they suffer in terms of acting as well.  The characters who returned to reprise their roles do a fairly good job.  Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are fantastic.  However, the real talent lies in Ian McKellen.  Single handedly, he carries to movie from start to finish.  It's amazing the man doesn't have an oscar yet, as whenever he's in a role, you look at him not as an actor, but as the character.However, as I said, the new actors who came on board are weak.  They act as though they have no direction.  Which brings me to the script.  A lot of the dialogue is corny and tacky.  When delivered from the cast that joins the X-Men roster, they even sound as though they were unsure of the script.  It's as if the director didn't care to work with them enough.  A lot of the new characters aren't really into character at all.The special effects are dazzling, though.  They look fantastic and play out extremely well.  Again, however, too much emphasis is put on the special effects.  There's little emphasis at all on the characters however.  It's hard to feel for the new characters introduced.The bottom line is simple: If you're a movie goer that loves a character driven story where you actually grow to shake hands with the characters and feel for them... this movie is simply not for you.  It clearly has summer blockbuster written all over it.  There are plenty of special effects and explosions, but hardly any substance beyond that.  Even the storyline feels a bit like an extra at times.  The war is given perfect emphasis, but we don't really go back and explore Jean that much.  It's to the point where you really don't care that she's become someone controlled by her own powers.  We don't learn enough about her dark side anyway.However, if you're one who loves to go to a movie just for the sake of having fun, I'd be lying to you if I told you you weren't going to find it here.  The movie is a fun ride.  The special effects are brilliant, and there's a comedic essence to the movie that makes it enjoyable to watch, despite some of the bad dialogue.  The final scenes of the movie are among the best.Overall, it's 3.5.  It's definitely a summer movie.  Lots of fun and excitement, but with little substance, and that's hard to admit seeing as how other super hero movies such as X2, Spider Man 2 and Batman Begins were willing to take that extra step that made you see them as more than just summer hits, but rather as actual films of acheivement.  X-Men: The Last Stand is a good movie, but doesn't take that extra leap that other superhero movies before it took.",3,Not Horrible But Not Positively Brilliant,1149292800,"06 3,

1012603,A3A4ZAIBQWKOZS,B000HCO83G,Stephen M. Lerch,"[1, 2]","To preface this, I am an X-men fan, but not one of the fanatical fans. My experience with the X-men consists of some exposure in the comics, more exposure in the TV cartoon and then with the 2 other movies.This film lost the director from the first two films, Brian Singer, and with him the overall feel of the movie changed IMO. When I viewed the previous two films I wasn't left with an over riding feeling that those involved in creating it were making an overly political statement with them. In this film, however, they make no bones about the fact that they are basing a lot of situations and action on the things that are taking place in the ""current"" political scene. Granted the others could be seen as tackling issues such as racism and segregation, but I'd have a hard time attaching them to what I believe is a overly political statement on the current governmental issues. I like my movies with social commentary to them, but thinly veiling a film as a political vehicle is something I find annoying, especially when they go eliminating characters that they really had no business eliminating in my opinion.The DVD authoring is nothing short of astounding. The believe the level of clarity achieved here can only be beaten by HD content. You would be hard pressed to find a DVD release that looks better than this. The DTS audio is extremely nice to hear as well and is quite crisp and clear. Worth a listen if you have the capability.Overall I am highly satisfied with the DVD itself but highly disappointed in the film itself. Knowing this series was to be a trilogy and being presented with a bridge for the possible continuation of the property in a film version later on down the road was disappointing. Offering the finality of the deaths of key characters then creating an ""out"" for future releases is a poor solution for me. If you're going to end it, end it. If you want to continue it, leave it open ended. It's that simple.Worth checking out to see the conclusion, but for me nothing more than that. It certainly isn't something I'm likely to watch frequently.If you liked the first 2 movies and don't mind overly political statements in your films, then this is probably a good movie to watch.

1012606,A31M2QHES2IMB,B000HCO83G,"Steven Scott ""LeChuck""","[2, 2]","I have not viewed the DVD of this, so I can't comment on the quality of the bonus features or anything like that.  I saw it in Grauman's Chinese Theater opening night with a packed house and the excitement was all around me.  The last two X-men movies were decent adaptations under the helm of Bryan Singer, X2 being the superior movie, and although Brett Ratner had taken over the directing reins, I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and I went in without any pre-conceived notions.  I came out angry that they ruined what could have been the best X-men movie thus far.So going into it, I thought X3 had a lot of potential.  From the trailers it seemed to have some really great action in it as well as visual effects.  I thought the opening scene was really fantastic.  When I saw the giant sentinel head fall down through the fog I got really psyched because I figured it was foreshadowing the fact that we'd be seeing more sentinels later on.  And then you never do!I liked the fact that it turns out to be a danger room sequence because that's something else I always wanted to see in the movies as well, so it was off to a good start.  And then it immediately started going downhill when Jean returns as Phoenix and they kill off Cyclops.  I will admit Cyclops isn't my favorite X-man, but I definitely feel he got the shaft in these movies.  He was hardly in X2 and then to just kill him off like that?  He definitely should have been around for the final battle at least.  Supposedly the reason behind this being that when I heard the screenwriter Simon Kinberg speaking at Comic Con this past year in San Diego, he explained the reason he killed Cyclops off so early was to show the audience right off the bat that anything can and will happen in this movie.  I believe the more accurate explanation is that James Marsden was busy shooting Superman Returns with Bryan Singer and so it was probably in his contract that he required a minor role in The Last Stand.I liked Beast a lot in it.  He was a great addition and I wish he had been in every single movie.  That's probably the one thing most people will agree they did right.  Kelsey Grammer was a great casting choice. He really nailed the character showing us Beast's intelligence as well as his ferocity in battle.  It was cool to see Angel make an appearance but he wasn't in it very much and they didn't develop the Cure storyline very well.It was obvious they were going to eventually have a Pyro/Iceman showdown and it was cool to finally see him turn into ice, but they should have done it sooner.  I wanted to see him surf on ice like he does in the comics.  And I can't believe they didn't have a Juggernaut/Colossus match!  How could they possibly have these two in the same movie and not think to do that is beyond me.All right, so here's my biggest complaint and the biggest change I would have made.  I hated the fact that they kept taking away mutant powers from characters like Mystique and Magneto.  I won't even get started on Prof. X getting killed because it does happen eventually.  The worst thing though is having Rogue go through with the cure.  I was completely convinced that at some point she would show up again and touch Phoenix, and not only would that bring Jean back to normal, but then Rogue would gain her flying and strength abilities through that and be able to fly around and destroy stuff in the final battle.  I realize it's not exactly the way it was done in Marvel continuity but it would have been much better than the alternative.  The fact that Rogue lost her power and they killed off Phoenix was the worst decision ever!  It made Rogue's character pointless throughout the entire series in my opinion.  Why would they put her in the first movie without all her powers unless they were planning on giving them to her at some point?  She should have either had them from the start or not been in the series at all if this is how they're going to treat her character.The Last Stand never really felt like an X-men movie all the way through.  That's why I say it's a decent action movie for those who knew nothing about the X-men prior to the movies, but for fans of the comics and the series, it's truly a disappointment.  They got a few details right here and there, but for the most part it seemed like they just picked up where the last one left off and then made it up from there and had no idea what to do.  What they should have done would be to have ended it with the X-men and the brotherhood of mutants fighting each other, but then had sentinels show up, so they would have had to team up temporarily in order to survive.  If they insisted on including the cure story line, there should have been a subplot about the sentinels rounding up mutants and forcing them to take the cure if they're unwilling to.  I really wanted to see a sentinel battle if you couldn't tell.And the fact that they teased us with Gambit's name, Remy LeBeau, on a monitor in X2 but didn't bring him in for the third (and possibly final) movie is inexcusable.  I believe part of the reason they were killing off characters and taking away their powers was to put an end to the series, thus ""The Last Stand"", but I definitely think if they wanted to bring it back in a few years, they could introduce Bishop.  If anyone remembers Bishop, (the time traveling mutant from the comics who's always trying to alter the past to fix the future), and if they were to make another X-men movie, Bishop should come back and stop this movie from happening.  Or at least stop Prof. X and everyone else from dying.  Also the scene at the end of the credits really didn't make much sense at all and it felt like the final insult to X-men fans everywhere.  Overall, I couldn't understand why the producers couldn't have attempted to keep it more true to its comic roots, but for now, we can let the X-men movie franchise rest in peace.",2,Good action movie.

Anyway.Over 95% of die hard comic book fans are going to hate this movie. Why? Because all comic fans are wannabe directors. The problem is that many aren't even satisfied with the comics themselves, as they are also wannabe writers as well. They may like this story arc but not the next. I know every single one of them will walk out of theather and say ""I could have done that better""The X-Men are a very complicated superhero team. With miles of backstory,over 40 years of history, and team roster that is constantly changing. Any director would find this  a very challenging project to undertake. The fans all have their own favorite characters of the 198 currently in the comic. Some will be disappointed if their fave isn't included. Others have their favorite stories that they want to see done. Yet, a lot of those stories require a tons of exposition to make sense to common moviegoer.Let's take the Dark Phoenix story. In the comic Jean seemly died while saving the X-Men. Only to come back extremely powerful. During a fight with the Hellfire club Jean's dark side was let loose. She went into space and devoured a sun that was supporting life for over 5 billion people. The aliens then come to earth and demand that she die. Now any comic fan can tell you I left out a whole bunch of details. In a movie I would need to introduce the hellfire club,the Shi'ar imperial guard and explain all their powers. Plus the effects for each of those powers. Not to mention the phoenix devouring a sun and show the deaths of the inhabited worlds.Its impossible. So this is a different story. To be enjoyed on its own merit. Not compared with a comic that cost about $2.50. One day the technology will allow an X-Men movie to be closer to the comic and not cost close to a quarter of a billion dollars. But that day is a ways off yet. Superhero films are so much better now. The effects have given us some great action when compared to the 50's,60's and 70's.So enjoy this movie and stop trying to make a better film in your head. Cause everybody knows that no matter how great the special effect are you can always make something better in your mind.",5,I'm a long time comic book fan and I love this movie!!!,1156723200,"08 28, 2006",2006,2271,"['film', 'great', 'end', 'trilogy', 'what', 'seeing', 'how', 'made', 'much', 'money', 'kinda', 'doubt', 'Anyway.Over', '95', '%', 'die', 'hard', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'are', 'going', 'hate', 'movie', 'Why', 'comic', 'fans', 'are', 'wannabe', 'directors', 'problem', 'many', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'satisfied', 'comics', 'are', 'also', 'wannabe', 'writers', 'as', 'well', 'may', 'like', 'story', 'arc', 'not', 'next', 'know', 'single', 'one', 'will', 'walk', 'theather', 'say', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'X-Men', 'are', 'very', 'complicated', 'superhero', 'team', 'miles', 'backstory', '40', 'years', 'history', 'team', 'roster', 'constantly', 'changing', 'director', 'would', 'find', 'very', 'challenging', 'project', 'undertake', 'fans', 'have', 'own', 'favorite', 'characters', '198', 'currently', 'comic', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'fave', ""n't"", 'included', 'Others', 'have', 'favorite', 'stories', 'want', 'see', 'done', 'lot', 'stories', 'require', 'tons', 'exposition', 'make', 'sense', 'common', 'moviegoer.Let', 'take', 'Dark', 'Phoenix', 'story', 'comic', 'Jean', 'seemly', 'died', 'saving', 'X-Men', 'Only', 'come', 'back', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'fight', 'Hellfire', 'club', 'Jean', 'dark', 'side', 'was', 'let', 'loose', 'went', 'space', 'devoured', 'sun', 'was', 'supporting', 'life', '5', 'billion', 'people', 'aliens', 'then', 'come', 'earth', 'demand', 'Now', 'comic', 'fan', 'can', 'tell', 'left', 'out', 'whole', 'bunch', 'details', 'movie', 'would', 'need', 'introduce', 'hellfire', 'club', ""Shi'ar"", 'imperial', 'guard', 'explain', 'powers', 'effects', 'powers', 'Not', 'mention', 'phoenix', 'devouring', 'sun', 'show', 'deaths', 'inhabited', 'worlds.Its', 'impossible', 'different', 'story', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'own', 'merit', 'Not', 'compared', 'comic', 'cost', '2.50', 'One', 'day', 'technology', 'will', 'allow', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'be', 'closer', 'comic', 'not', 'cost', 'close', 'quarter', 'billion', 'dollars', 'day', 'ways', 'off', 'yet', 'Superhero', 'films', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'now', 'effects', 'have', 'given', 'great', 'action', 'when', 'compared', ""50's,60"", ""70's.So"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'stop', 'trying', 'make', 'better', 'film', 'head', 'Cause', 'everybody', 'matter', 'how', 'great', 'special', 'effect', 'are', 'can', 'always', 'make', 'something', 'better', 'mind']",N/A

While others team up with the X-men to try and help them stop Magneto. There's also a subplot to this film.

The last shot of X2 was of the Phoenix's fire emblem in the lake, which is completely abandoned in this travesty.  The other two sticking points of this hack script are the off-screen death of Scott Summers/Cyclops WTF? and the death of Professor Xavier, the mainstay of this entire franchise.

1012612,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B000HCO83G,Terry Mesnard,"[1, 4]","X-men: The Last Stand will have reviewers and viewers divided.  Some, who know only a little or nothing at all of the X-men mythos, will enjoy it.  Some, who have read or seen all of the comics, will hate it.  And some will be like me, stuck in the middle.As a movie, X-men 3 is a pretty good way to end the *movie* series.  It ties up a lot of plot-lines, has some good twists, great Fx and a pretty decent story about love and mutants.  Its exciting to watch, visually stunning in parts and actually and surprisingly keeps the style and tone of the first two admirably well.On the other hand, as a story set in a mythos that is dozens upon dozens of years in the making, X-Men 3 falls flat on its face.  I  loved the first two, even though the mythos was messed around a bit, because it was a movie and you have to make some concessions.  Bryan Singer did an admirable job trying to tie together years upon years of story and create something that is true to the source and entertaining to those who have no idea who Wolverine is, as an example.  Unfortunately, X3 throws the mythos out of the window and simply does things it shouldn't do.  I can't talk about most of these things because I don't believe in spoilers.I will say, Rogue was totally under-used and spent most of the movie standing in line.  Storm was finally used in a decent way.  The major deaths in the film were insipid (as was the after-the-credits ""revelation"" that really ruined anything the movie had going for it).  Bret Rattner apparently has seen the Juggernaut video and there is a scene that is a nice and hillarious homage to that video.  But unfortunately, practically everything the first two films stood for was thrown out of the window.So, I'm torn.  On one hand, the movie was pretty decent as a *movie*.  Unfortunately, a portion of my soul died when I saw it last night and shook my head at the way Ratner handled the story.  If you know nothing about the X-men mythos, enjoy.  If you have read every single comic book, be prepared for a let down.  If you're like me, go in with an open mind, knowing that it won't be exactly as it should and maybe you won't be disappointed.

Magnito does not act like himself.  Professor X states the obvious constantly.  Also the mutant class classism is bizarre.

Then the action picks up at the dam, where ""2"" ended. Scott, a.k.a. Cyclops (James Marsden) is taking the death of Jean (Famke Janssen) very badly and decides to ride off on his motorcycle. Soon, he finds himself at the lake and the dam and is surprised when Jean appears and walks towards him. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) picks this up as well and sends Storm (Halle Berry) and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to the location. There, they find an unconscious Jean and only Scott's signature glasses. They return to the school and Xavier puts Jean under, trying to control her bad, reckless second persona, Phoenix. Meanwhile, Beast (Kelsey Grammer), the Secretary of Mutant Affairs, learns Worthington Pharmaceutical has created a cure for the Mutant gene, news which instantly divides both the Mutant and Human communities. Magneto (Sir Ian McKellan) fears it will be used as a weapon against the Mutants and is determined to destroy it, but first, he has to release Mystique (Rebecca Romijn), who has been captured by the government. Along the way, we meet new characters as the story leads to a dramatic confrontation on Alcatraz Island, where Worthington Pharmaceutical is based, and storing the source of their cure.""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is pretty much the definition of a `summer movie'. A ""sequel"", based on a ""comic book"", filled with lots of ""special effects"" and ""action""; these are the buzz words you are likely to find reprinted in the newspaper ads, touting the merits of the film. ""Last Stand"" has a surprising amount of story as well, but the story doesn't help develop the characters, new or old, or some of the relationships. If you haven't seen the previous two films, you might be lost.As the story begins working through its machinations, certain characters stand out, others fade into the background for large stretches of time. The new characters are given particularly short shrift. We quickly meet a new man who can turn himself into metal and seems to be very strong, but I didn't ever hear his ""X-Men"" name. At one point, Wolverine says ""Hey, Tin Man?"", but I suspect this was his sarcastic persona at work. The character seems to be around to simply provide strength. Another new student, a girl, who makes Rogue (Anna Paquin) jealous because her boyfriend, Bobby, aka, Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), shows an interest in her, can walk through walls and allow things to pass through her. Again, didn't catch her name. Magneto picks up a more interesting lot, including Juggernaut (a buffed up Vinnie Jones), who can run through anything, picking up incredible speed, and a guy who can replicate himself multiple times. Unfortunately, the film doesn't do a good job of creating all of these characters in a memorable way. I honestly couldn't remember many of their names and had to look them up on imdb.com.Also, the filmmakers make some strange choices regarding plotting. They introduce a particular story line and then the action cuts abruptly to another character or part of the story. You would naturally assume to return to the first story in the next scene, but more often than not, the filmmakers visit another storyline, then another, sometimes providing lengthy vacations from the first scene, before returning. At this point, you may have even forgotten the first scene. For instance, we visit an ominous government caravan transporting Mystique under heavy security. She has a funny exchange with one of the guards inside the large windowless truck. Then the action cuts to something else, and then something else again. Later, we join Magneto and Pyro (Aaron Stanford) addressing a crowd of Mutants. The villain soon learns one of the Mutants can sense where other Mutants are. ""Can you locate someone for me?"" Oh, right, he has to help Mystique escape. Three scenes later, we see an exterior shot of the mysterious caravan and Magneto standing in the middle of the country road.As the story begins unfolding, the filmmakers capture our attention with the sheer spectacle of everything; lots of action and special effects. But we don't learn anything about the characters, making it merely an exercise. As Wolverine and Storm run around (oddly, Storm is the only `good' Mutant never referred to by her human name) we see them in action, remarks are made to help establish something about their characters, but we never learn the meanings behind the remarks. As we meet the new characters, we don't learn about them either. Why is Angel (Ben Foster), Worthington's son, trying to cut off his wings in the prologue, but as a young man he seems very reluctant to take the cure his father has developed? In the first two films, director Bryan Singer provided these answers, or at least clues to them. Brett Ratner is more interested in blowing things up and using an incredible arsenal of special effects.Also, this is the first time I have ever felt that a villain was, well, sort of stupid. There is a rich tradition of super villains concocting outlandish plans for world domination and, yes, they tend to do stupid things. For instance, how often have villains stopped to tell James Bond their entire plan, only to give him the opportunity to free one of his hands? Hey, Blofeld! That's all it takes. One hand. But Magneto's plan in ""Last Stand"" has a fatal flaw. After he learns Worthington Pharmaceuticals has the source for their cure on Alcatraz Island, he decides to retrieve it and destroy it. Okay, check. No problem, so far. He'll just take a ferry or some ship to get there, right? Wrong. He decides to uproot the Golden Gate Bridge and move it to provide a walkway to the Island. An impressive sequence, providing a lot of work for Special Effects wizards, but how does this make sense? Through these actions, Magneto has provided both the X-Men and the military with an easier way to get to the Island and hamper his efforts.""Last Stand"" is fun, mindless entertainment. But it could've been so much better. It is definitely not at the level of the previous two entries.Now that Bryan Singer has ""Superman Returns"" out of his system, hopefully he will return to helm ""X-Men 4: The Next to Last Stand"". Oh, trust me. There will be a sequel, despite all the statements from the actors about ""Last Stand"" ending the trilogy.",3,Someone Needed to Sharpen The Claws,1148947200,"05 30, 2006",2006,6526,"['**', 'Two',

1012618,A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B000HCO83G,"THowerton ""SHowT""","[0, 0]","For the casual X-Men moviegoer fan this movie might satisfy: it has a lot of action, some fun special effects, and a tantalizing plot about being able to stop being someone you don't want to be in a moment through use of a miracle drug.  This probably resonates with a lot of people both because we are constantly told to be better than we are and that we can be all that we can be through some formula (drugs; diets; drinking the right beer...).  So this film, to be fair, has a good angle for a comic book action movie.  Oh, and they did a crackshot whizzbang job with the Beast (Kelsey Grammar, who'da thunk it! tremendous job!).  And there are a couple of shock-value moments (deaths of main characters, callous dismissals of others) that are sure to make the cinephiles following all of this to maybe perk up and go ""no way they just did that.""So I'll admit to there being some entertainment value here.  But for the diehard fanatic, for the follower of the classic X-Men X-ploits the film deals beloved characters short-shrift (Cyclops) and major emotional main storylines as punchlines (I'm looking at you, Phoenix).  It's enough to make a raging Canuck like Wolvie cry.But it's certainly not as horrible as a lot of diehard fans make it out.  It's also not nearly so great as some of the tailgaters claim.

1012620,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B000HCO83G,Tom Benton,"[4, 7]","Fans gasped when it was announced that X-MEN and X2 director Bryan Singer was leaving X-MEN III to make SUPERMAN RETURNS - and he was taking his crew with him. Singer told 20th Century Fox that, if they would wait until he completed SUPERMAN RETURNS, he would make X-MEN III as well. Fox decided to go ahead without Singer, bringing numerous directors on to the project before settling on Brett Ratner. This worried fans ever more, as they realized that Ratner's previous films included RUSH HOUR, MONEY TALKS, and THE FAMILY MAN. What many fans forgot is that Ratner also directed the superb RED DRAGON. Personally, I was optimistic. Ratner's work on both RUSH HOUR movies and on RED DRAGON had impressed me, and I thought that he could do a nice job on the film.I was right - sort of. Ratner does a fine job, but he tends to favor shots that are either very close or very far away. Because of this, he creates a sort of claustrophobic feeling which hung with me throughout the film. Also, he can't wring great performances out of the actors like Bryan Singer can. On the plus side, Ratner does create some stunning visuals (with lots of help from the special effects team) - namely a sequence involving the Golden Gate Bridge. Though Ratner is potentially a very good director, he is nowhere near as talented as Bryan Singer.Three other new additions to the crew are screenwriters Simon Kinberg (MR. & MRS. SMITH) and Zak Penn (BEHIND ENEMY LINES, ELEKTRA) and composer John Powell (THE BOURNE IDENTITY). The script is good, though it feels like the events in the film are rather rushed. Perhaps editors Mark Goldblatt, Mark Helfrich, and Julia Wong - taking over for John Ottman - are to blame for this. I also noticed that some of Wolverine's lines seemed forced; they didn't seem natural like those from the previous films. I must say that the ending, however, is very clever. Very clever indeed.Then we come to the matter of the soundtrack. John Powell's music fluctuated between being grand and atrocious. It's a sweeping score, but it seems a little too over-the-top. It's not as good as John Ottman's score for X2 or Michael Kamen's score for X-MEN, but it will suffice.The cast seemed far less stellar this time. At her request, Halle Berry's part was expanded. Though I've always thought that Storm was an interesting character - and Berry did very well as her in the first two films - her performance seems rather weak in this film. Hugh Jackman is still excellent as Wolverine, but even his performance isn't as wonderful as it was in the previous films. Then we have Ian McKellen, who is just outstanding as Magneto. He shines in each and every one of his scenes. Famke Janssen is great, although she doesn't get many lines. Also great is Kelsey Grammer as Hank McCoy (a.k.a. Beast), Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde, and especially Vinnie Jones (LOCK, STOCK, AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS, SNATCH.) as Juggernaut. Juggernaut is a hulking character whose special ability is plowing through everything and everyone with no difficulty whatsoever. Jones turns Juggernaut into an extremely amusing character. His scenes are the most fun of any in the film.As both a comic book fan and an avid moviegoer, I enjoyed this film very much. However, the comic fan within me wishes that we'd learnt the origins of Hank McCoy (which I've also found very interesting) and seen Gambit, one of the major X-Men characters from the comics (LOST's Josh Holloway, a perfect choice, was offered the part but turned it down).

He even gets something like a performance out of Halle Berry, which is more than Singer ever managed. Shame about the terrible CGI make-up effects that make the `younger' Patrick Stewart look like a Final Fantasy character in the prologue though.Although some found the film a little too short, after looking at the deleted scenes on the DVD, I'm not really sure if it is that possible to extend the movie without going the Spiderman 2.1 route and filming new scenes - most of them are alternate bet-hedging versions of scenes in the film (like the Rogue cured/not cured variations).

It is about the human side of mutants. Their powers are there but what we are looking into are their human side, how they are not different from other humans when it comes to day to day life. They all long for love, they all suffer from loss, and they all wanted to be treated equally. However, dealing with differences is never the strength of Homo sapiens, so the story of X-men - the struggle for survival and integration in the human world, where they were supposed to belong to - continues.X3 presented itself as The Last Stand, hinting that it will be a story to end all stories. Is it true? In X2 we saw Scott suffered the lost of Jean, but will the return of Jean as Phoenix, the dark ego of herself, be able to fill the emptiness inside him? Jean had become what both Charles and Magneto have foreseen, someone they were both excited and worried, even scared. At this time came the cure, which ironically, was created from another mutant who has the power to neutralise any mutant power within his proximity - a mutant born to cure another mutant. Some people long for the cure, while others treated as a threat to their very own existence. A battle is on the verge of breaking out.In X3 we see a lot more on the human sides of the heroes and villains themselves. How they suffer more losses, how some were indifferent to the loss of others, how some to struggled just to be accepted, how some tried to change themselves so that they could seek what they want in life. However, would all these efforts come to an end with the rise of the Dark Phoenix - the mutant evolution that went beyond all mutants? We see a lot more mutants well known in the comics showing up in X3 - Multiple Man, Angel, Beast etc. We would also be able to see Iceman in his comic form for the first time. Fans of the comic or the movie series will not be disappointed. However, certain faces left us this time round, the most noticeable being the Nightcrawler, whom was featured quite prominently in X2. The director has changed but the direction of the movie hasn't so you can feel the continuity of style going quite naturally in X3. The movie was made a way that it is an end for the trilogy, but as usual, there is a tail to the end, probably if 20th Century Fox can get all the main cast signing up again (this time will be for an astronomical price), then we might see the X-men again.",5,The human side of mutants and mutants who want to be human,1148688000,"05 27, 2006",2006,2465,"['X-men', 'distinguished', 'other', 'modern', 'sci-fi', 'flick', 'way', 'very', 'human', 'human', 'side', 'mutants', 'powers', 'are', 'there', 'what', 'are', 'looking', 'are', 'human', 'side', 'how', 'are', 'not', 'different', 'other', 'humans', 'when', 'day', 'day', 'life', 'long', 'love', 'suffer', 'loss', 'wanted', 'be', 'treated', 'equally', 'However', 'dealing', 'differences', 'never', 'strength', 'Homo', 'sapiens', 'story', 'X-men', 'struggle', 'survival', 'integration', 'human', 'world', 'where', 'were', 'supposed', 'belong', 'continues.X3', 'presented', 'Last', 'Stand', 'hinting', 'will', 'be', 'story', 'end', 'stories', 'true', 'X2', 'saw', 'Scott', 'suffered', 'lost', 'Jean', 'will', 'return', 'Jean', 'Phoenix', 'dark', 'ego', 'herself', 'be', 'able', 'fill', 'emptiness', 'Jean', 'had', 'become', 'what', 'Charles', 'Magneto', 'have', 'foreseen', 'someone', 'were', 'excited', 'worried', 'even', 'scared', 'time', 'came', 'cure', 'ironically', 'was', 'created', 'mutant', 'who', 'power', 'neutralise', 'mutant', 'power', 'proximity', 'mutant', 'born', 'cure', 'mutant', 'people', 'long', 'cure', 'others', 'treated', 'threat', 'very', 'own', 'existence', 'battle', 'verge', 'breaking', 'out.In', 'X3', 'see', 'lot', 'more', 'human', 'sides', 'heroes', 'How', 'suffer', 'more', 'losses', 'how', 'were', 'indifferent', 'loss', 'others', 'how', 'struggled', 'just', 'be', 'accepted', 'how', 'tried', 'change', 'so', 'could', 'seek', 'what', 'want', 'life', 'However', 'would', 'all', 'efforts', 'come', 'end', 'rise', 'Dark', 'Phoenix', 'mutant', 'evolution', 'went', 'mutants', 'see', 'lot', 'more', 'mutants', 'well', 'known', 'comics', 'showing', 'up', 'X3', 'Multiple', 'Man', 'Angel', 'Beast', 'etc', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'Iceman', 'comic', 'form', 'first', 'time', 'Fans', 'comic', 'movie', 'series', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'However', 'certain', 'left', 'time', 'round', 'most', 'noticeable', 'being', 'Nightcrawler', 'whom', 'was', 'featured', 'quite', 'prominently', 'X2', 'director', 'changed', 'direction', 'movie', ""n't"", 'so', 'can', 'feel', 'continuity', 'style', 'going', 'quite', 'naturally', 'X3', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'way', 'end', 'trilogy', 'usual', 'tail', 'end', 'probably', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'can', 'get', 'main', 'cast', 'signing', 'up', 'again', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'astronomical', 'price', 'then', 'might', 'see', 'X-men', 'again']",N/A
1012627,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000HCO83G,Tsuyoshi,"[8, 12]","Many reviewers have already posted excellent reviews below, so I don't think I need to write down the entire story of the third `X-Men' film. The so-so story about the `cure' is interesting at first, but it is terribly oversimplified. And the return of Jean Grey (or Phoenix) is not a big surprise if you have seen the ending of the second `X-men' film very carefully. I only add to say that the two storylines, both of which I heard can be seen in the original comic in separate episodes, do not merge well.In other words, so many life-changing things happen to the characters, but the fast-paced film fails to be emotional when it should be most. Cyclops is reduced to Character # 1; Rogue is almost forgotten; and Jean Grey, Magneto, and other characters are all buried in the flood of eye-popping special effects.Many new characters are introduced, but except for Kelsey Grammer's perfect Dr. Hank McCoy, they are mostly forgettable, or treated as if disposable. They are all only the pixels among the costly CGI, and perhaps director Brett Ratner, who mercilessly Hollywoodnized Jackie Chan and his stunts in 'Rush Hour' series, thought the same way as Magneto, who coldly says they are just 'pawns' of the chess game.I admit the excellence of the visual effects. It is made as a big-budget summer blockbuster film, and it really is. But what made the first and second `X-Men' films different is missing here. You don't share the sadness of these characters, and you don't understand the complicated feelings that these characters expressed. Still you may be amazed by the special effects, but these amazing effects can be seen somewhere else, like `Fantastic Four.'",3,(2.5 STARS) Great Series Reduced to Average Actioner (But What Did You Expect from the New Director?),1157932800,"09 11, 2006",2006,1671,"['Many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'posted', 'excellent', 'reviews', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'need', 'write', 'down', 'entire', 'story', 'third', 'X-Men', 'film', 'so-so', 'story', 'cure', 'interesting', 'first', 'terribly', 'oversimplified', 'return', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'Phoenix', 'not', 'big', 'surprise', 'have', 'seen', 'ending', 'second', 'X-men', 'film', 'very', 'carefully', 'only', 'add', 'say', 'two', 'storylines', 'heard', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'original', 'comic', 'separate', 'episodes', 'do', 'not', 'merge', 'other', 'words', 'so', 'many', 'life-changing', 'things', 'happen', 'characters', 'fast-paced', 'film', 'fails', 'be', 'emotional', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'most', 'Cyclops', 'reduced', 'Character', '1', 'Rogue', 'almost', 'forgotten', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'Magneto', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'buried', 'flood', 'eye-popping', 'special', 'effects.Many', 'new', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'perfect', 'Dr.', 'Hank', 'McCoy', 'are', 'mostly', 'forgettable', 'treated', 'disposable', 'are', 'only', 'pixels', 'costly', 'CGI', 'perhaps', 'director', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'who', 'mercilessly', 'Hollywoodnized', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'stunts', ""'Rush"", 'Hour', 'series', 'thought', 'same', 'way', 'Magneto', 'who', 'coldly', 'are', 'just', ""'pawns"", 'chess', 'game.I', 'admit', 'excellence', 'visual', 'effects', 'made', 'big-budget', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'film', 'really', 'what', 'made', 'first', 'second', 'X-Men', 'films', 'different', 'missing', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'share', 'sadness', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'complicated', 'feelings', 'characters', 'expressed', 'Still', 'may', 'be', 'amazed', 'special', 'effects', 'amazing', 'effects', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'somewhere', 'else', 'Fantastic', 'Four']",N/A
1012628,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000HCO83G,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[1, 1]","Superhero movies tend to work best if done as a trilogy. Unfortunately, studios don't view superhero movies that way and see a particular character or characters as being a franchise: if they can get characters on the screen more than in just three movies then the better it is for them. This seems to be the approach that was taken with X-MEN: THE LAST STAND. The series was originally envisioned as being a trilogy with one or two spin-offs. That approach seems to have been thrown out. Granted some of that might have to do with the series and film's original director, Bryan Singer, leaving and taking the majority of the production crew with him to make SUPERMAN RETURNS. After Singer's departure, X-MEN: THE LAST STAND was in production limbo for awhile until Brett Ratner was given the reigns. In a strange bit of irony, Ratner was originally supposed to direct the first two X-Men films and left and was supposed to direct SUPERMAN RETURNS and left there, too. In both instances, Singer took over the helm. Despite the change-up in direction and production, there really isn't an excuse for X-MEN: THE LAST STAND being the somewhat lackluster film that it came to be.The story itself is full of promise. The federal government develops a vaccine that can cure mutants of their disease. Many mutants are excited by the prospect of living life as a normal human. However, many other mutants aren't very keen on the idea. Neither Professor X (Patrick Stewart) or Magneto (Ian McKellen) support the vaccine. Both mutant leaders believe that mutants should embrace their talents and gifts. However, the two leaders strongly differ on their approach. Professor X preaches tolerance while Magneto sees the creation of the vaccine as a declaration of war upon all mutants. The mutants led by Magneto begin the war against humanity in full force, while the X-Men find themselves in the middle: protecting the humans and preaching Professor X's message of tolerance and unity.The movie builds up to a huge climatic battle between Magneto's mutants and the X-Men and humans on Alcratraz. Unfortunately, this battle doesn't live up to the expectations it has built. There are some very cool parts of the battle, e.g. the scenes with Beast (Kelsey Grammer). However, the battle is rather anti-climatic. Everything in the film leads up to that battle and then nothing really happens. That is a major let down.The best part about X-MEN: THE LAST STAND is seeing different mutants on screen. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is back as is Storm (Halle Berry). Professor X and Magneto are here, too. In fact many of the mutants from the first two movies have returned (well Toad and Sabertooth and Nightcrawler are mysteriously absent, though Nightcrawler's absence is explained in the video game based on the movie). However, other than those four most of the mutants play much smaller roles. Rogue is hardly on the screen; Cyclops is destroyed with only about a minute of screen time; Angel's introduction is huge, but he's not really seen. I realize that part of this is because there are so many superheroes and not all of them can be seen in each film. However, part of it is because the studio is setting things up for sequels to come. In some way, they are following the lead of the comic books: some characters are written off to make room for new ones, but if need be you can always bring someone back from the dead. That makes for interesting, though frustrating reading, but doesn't translate well on the big screen.Overall, X-MEN: THE LAST STAND is a mediocre comic book movie.

Williams ""world traveller""","[8, 15]","Having never seen either of the first two X-movies, I didn't really know what to expect when I ventured off to what I had hoped would be the one action spectacular in season full of medicore (reheated and rehashed) summer fare.Although I had enjoyed the very simply-executed cartoon series, I was never interested in either of the previous film adaptations. I suppose it seemed that some comic book/cartoons should remain a guilty pleasure and be spared the bloated silver screen treatment. (Besides, how good can a movie with Halle Berry playing anything besides Halle Berry really be? And in a white fright wig, no less.)Nevertheless, I succombed to the lure of advertisement and the novelty of seeing Kelsey Grammer in blue fur.Unfortuatnely, an indigo-hued ""Frasier"" was hardly worth the $8.50 I paid for the ticket. The story (""script? what script?"") was unfocused and the dialogue was amateurish. The acting was so laughable that one might have a hard time imagining that this kind of scene-chewing would have even been acceptable on a daytime soap opera. Ian McKellen acquited himself, but with such a poorly-written script it was hard to fairly judge of what kind of performances the other poor lot stuck in this film might actually be capable. (Halle Berry? Yeah, that she was Halle Berry in a white wig is probably the kindest thing to say.)Despite an estimated budget of $210 million dollars, the film looked cheap and sort of spare - sort of like a bad 80's TV movie. Sure, there were some interesting special effects - and the last 30 minutes were a great improvement over what had come before. However, no action sequence or intriguing visual was spectacular enough to make me forget how bored I was.(They even messed up the chance to exploit the winged mutant. What a fantasy to be able to fly - and we were only treated to two short sequences.)I am afraid that I have been spoiled by the big fx films like the LOTR trilogy and the two Spiderman films. Those movies puilled me into worlds in which I could believe in hobbits bearing magic rings or that a geeky kid could climb walls and swing on webs shot from his hand. I never bought into the X-Men world - I was always conscious that this was a poorly-executed film.)The best thing I can say about this movie is that it makes the otherwise sluggish ""Chronicles of Narnia"" seem absolutely masterful. Heck, even the poorly-received ""Ultraviolet"" was better than this - it was at least fun. I doubt that the legions of fans will be diswayed by one man's review.

X3 is the classic example of this.  Where did it go wrong?  The plot.  My gripes are listed at the end just in case you haven't seen the movie.In short, this movie had the feel of guys in suits tampering with what they ought not, again.  And it stretched believability beyond a point that James Bond movies wouldn't even cross.  And Bond movies had some very far fetched things.  How hard is it to follow a proven storyline?  Specifically, the one in the comic books.What are my gripes?  Superheroes and supervillains should never lose their powers.  Key heroes should never die.  In short, Professor X or Cyclops should have never died (even though the movie suggests Professor X didn't really die).  Magneto should never have lost his power.  The Phoenix was relegated to a minor character until the director decided they needed to spend up all of the special effects budget.Finally, this movie is on Blu-Ray.  Blu-Ray is fine, but inferior to HD DVD except for storage space which is irrelevant thanks to Microsoft's VC-1 codec.  HD quality movies in VC-1 can fit on a standard DVD if you have no extras.

Comic book fans can rejoice as Angel and Beast have finally been introduced into the X-Men films.How has Brett Ratner done with the third ""X-Men"" film? Well the good news for those who had their doubts about Ratner is that he didn't screw it up. The main story points were written before he came on board while Singer was still attached to the project so, in many respects, this is an extension of Singer's first two films. The screenplay manages to pack quite a bit of action and resolution into it considering the film runs under two hours. Ratner does a great job setting up the action scenes and even does a solid job during the quieter character moments.The visual effects are stunning particularly a sequence involving Magneto moving the Golden Gate Bridge. There were a few scenes where the visuals weren't 100% convincing (those involving Angel)but on the whole the production is top notch. While Ratner focuses on the action and humor at the expense of the drama at times, he's crafted a fine film that holds up well when compared to the first two installments directed by Bryan Singer.Some fans of the comic book or animated series will probably object to the liberities taken with the storyline and characters but many of the important themes that were handled in the comic book receive their due here. Kelsey Grammer is terrific as Beast even though he probably could have used a bit more screen time and James Marsden although he's used effectively could probably have had his role pumped up a bit as well. While Famke Janssen does a marvelous job in her dual role I felt that she also was under utilized a bit.Synposis:Still grieving over the loss of Jean Grey (Famke Jannsen)Cyclops (James Marsden)has shirked his duties teaching the kids at ""mutant high"". Wolverine (Hugh Jackman)steps in but expresses his concern to Cyclops and suggest he needs to ""move on"". Hearing Jean's voice in his head Cyclops leaves the school. A pharmaceutical company has developed a cure for the mutations a medication that will suppress the mutant gene permanently. Rogue (Anna Paquin) is for it while others such as Wolverine, Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Storm (Halle Berry) are against it. Magneto rallies more mutants to his cause in hopes of destroying the vaccine which he sees as humanity's attempt to eradicate mutants and make them like everyone else. The X-Men augmented by Beast (Kelsey Grammer perfectly cast), Kitty (Ellen Page) and Colossus(Daniel Cudmore) and Magneto end up butting heads against each other as he's concerned about the threat to humanity from Magneto and his hoard.

Personally, I found about as much to enjoy in the third installment as I did in the Bryan Singer-helmed first two. Sure, there was a palpable focus on two characters, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), but they're probably the two most interesting characters! Shocker! I certainly hope they don't end the series with three films - I am not a big X-Men fan, but I thoroughly enjoyed all three - great special effects, interesting plotlines, and memorable characters. Put those things together and you get a great popcorn flick, albeit with enough drama and character development to keep the non-fanboys interested.",4,What's the big departure?,1167955200,"01 5, 2007",2007,754,"['People', 'were', 'warning', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'involvement', 'series', 'would', 'send', 'entire', 'Marvel', 'universe', 'down', 'drain', 'Personally', 'found', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'enjoy', 'third', 'installment', 'did', 'Bryan', 'Singer-helmed', 'first', 'two', 'Sure', 'was', 'palpable', 'focus', 'two', 'characters', 'Wolverine', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'Famke', 'Janssen', ""'re"", 'probably', 'two', 'most', 'interesting', 'characters', 'Shocker', 'certainly', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'end', 'series', 'three', 'films', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'X-Men', 'fan', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'three', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'interesting', 'plotlines', 'memorable', 'characters', 'Put', 'things', 'together', 'get', 'great', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'enough', 'drama', 'character', 'development', 'keep', 'non-fanboys', 'interested']",N/A

As much as I enjoyed the first two - especially the 2nd one - this new movie had very much of a ""been there, done that"" feeling for me.  Perhaps it's because all of the super powers have already been demonstrated so well previously, or maybe because this is the first X-men movie without Mr. Singer at the helm.  Whatever the reason, I just never really got into the story.  I also thought several plot developments were handled rather casually or sloppily, especially the death (?) of one of the major characters and what happens to Mystique following the loss of her powers.  Another example is what happens when Kitty Pride attempts to rescue Leech and is pursued by Juggernaut.  The way he is taken out of action makes little sense in the scene, and doesn't match the X-men mythology either.  (I.e., Juggernaut's not having mutant powers.)  Then there are various continuity errors such as the way the Golden Gate bridge scene takes place during the day but then suddenly it is night, without an apparent time lapse(??).  The first two movies had a bunch of scenes where I thought, ""Wow, that's cool!""

It's a purely entertaining popcorn movie for all ages. I didn't think this one was as good as the first two, but it's more explosive and got an all-star cast. So glad to see Ellen Page(Marion Bridge) playing Kitten Pryde, she's the finest Canadian actress of her generation. Fellow Canadian actor Shawn Ashmore reprises his Bobby Drake role with more screentime this time. Not bad. A few new characters entered this film including the unrecognizable Kelsey Grammer playing Beast, and some other new  principle mutants also appeared. I was quite surprised to see Shohreh Aghdashloo as Dr. Kavita. Althogh she only had about five minutes of screentime, she was as always scene-stealing. Remember her from House of Sand and Fog? I think the briefly appeared Angel character was under-developed. Then there is the departure of some lead mutants, that I think was an indication that this is indeed the last installment. Would have love to see more of Mystique, but she had less than ten minutes this time. Even Storm(Halle Berry) is underexposed this time, kind of wasted. This film allowed Ian McKellan,Hugh Jackman and Famke Janseen to dominate the movie. The director also neglected to make the most of another talented actress like Anna Paquin, who had very low-key scenes to work with. I think Phoenix/Jean Grey was very striking, and it's a great opportunity to let Janseen shine with scenes that call for her to have mix expressions, but I couldn't help thinking how similar her character is to Carrie White. I enjoyed the film, but it's not so good that I would want to see it again in DVD.",3,"Great Action, weak script, and they even got Shohreh Aghdashloo!",1148860800,"05 29, 2006",2006,1702,"['X-Men-The', 'Last', 'Stand', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'less', 'interesting', 'script', 'change', 'director', 'purely', 'entertaining', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'ages', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'one', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'two', 'more', 'explosive', 'got', 'all-star', 'cast', 'So', 'glad', 'see', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'Marion', 'Bridge', 'playing', 'Kitten', 'Pryde', 'finest', 'Canadian', 'actress', 'generation', 'Fellow', 'Canadian', 'actor', 'Shawn', 'Ashmore', 'Bobby', 'Drake', 'role', 'more', 'screentime', 'time', 'Not', 'bad', 'few', 'new', 'characters', 'entered', 'film', 'including', 'unrecognizable', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'playing', 'Beast', 'other', 'new', 'principle', 'mutants', 'also', 'appeared', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'see', 'Shohreh', 'Aghdashloo', 'Dr.', 'Kavita', 'Althogh', 'only', 'had', 'five', 'minutes', 'screentime', 'was', 'always', 'scene-stealing', 'Remember', 'House', 'Sand', 'Fog', 'think', 'briefly', 'appeared', 'Angel', 'character', 'was', 'under-developed', 'Then', 'departure', 'lead', 'mutants', 'think', 'was', 'indication', 'indeed', 'last', 'installment', 'Would', 'have', 'love', 'see', 'more', 'Mystique', 'had', 'less', 'ten', 'minutes', 'time', 'Even', 'Storm', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'underexposed', 'time', 'kind', 'wasted', 'film', 'allowed', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Famke', 'Janseen', 'dominate', 'movie', 'director', 'also', 'neglected', 'make', 'most', 'talented', 'actress', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'who', 'had', 'very', 'low-key', 'scenes', 'work', 'think', 'Phoenix/Jean', 'Grey', 'was', 'very', 'striking', 'great', 'opportunity', 'let', 'Janseen', 'shine', 'scenes', 'call', 'have', 'mix', 'expressions', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'how', 'similar', 'character', 'Carrie', 'White', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'DVD']",N/A

It definitly holds to the standard of the other movies.  Good action and the working in of classic X-men characters and villians.  Colossus was always my favorite.  These movies are good adaptations of the comics to the big screen.  Again, the dialog is fairly shallow, as with the other movies, many of the lines being delivered by Storm (as usual, the whole frog line from the first movie, so deep and insightful).  But, in true comic book fantasy style, the storyline pulls through.  The computer graphics are great in widescreen progressive scan.  And, Is it possible, could they make another?  The question was left open. As far as the Extras and the ""three alternative endings"", Well, they were a bit of a let down.  The actual ending at Alcatraz was never in question, it's just 3 different scenerios in the last sequence after the battle is over and school begins.  In all, they would not alter the story line much....unless they were going to make another film, although the current ending with Magneto leaves everything open.

1012641,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B000HCO83G,Wuchak,"[0, 2]","I think the X-Men films have been so popular because the X-Men dare to be different. The concept of the X-Men strays far from superhero conventions. If you approach the X-Men films thinking you're getting something akin to Superman, Spider-Man or Batman, forget it.The unique concept of the X-Men is that humanity is starting to evolve to the next level and humans all over the globe are starting to manifest superhuman powers from the mutant ""X"" gene. Two mutant leaders, who are also old friends, take highly contrasting positions. Charles Xavier starts a school for mutant youths in upstate New York. His attitude is positive and his goal benign. Eric Lensherr or Magneto, on the other hand, is fed up with the paranoia of non-mutants. He starts a ""Brotherhood of Mutants"" with a clear attitude of superiority. And, as they say, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.You could say that Xavier takes the approach of Martin Luther King Jr. while Magneto goes the route of Malcolm X, an interesting comparison.Although everybody has their favorite, I feel all three films in the original trilogy are of the same general quality - ""X-Men (Widescreen Edition)"" (2000), ""X2: X-Men United (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)"" (2003) and ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" (2006).""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is generally well-regarded but has a very vocal segment of fans who revile it. This makes little sense since, despite having a new director, the film has the same tone and principle actors as the previous two and brings to culmination the ideas presented therein. Aside from the final fight between Magneto's Brotherhood and Xavier's X-Men we get the resurrection of Jean Grey and her struggle with the dark side of her psyche.Some complain of the deaths of two prominent characters, but how often are characters resurrected in comics? Isn't one significant character resurrected in this very film?
