206432,A1P27BGF8NAI29,6300186016,Alice in Wonderland,"[2, 2]","Lady Lou is the belle of Gus Jordan's Bowery saloon, the voice and figure that sets every man's...heart to throbbing. She's a woman in a man's world, and she plays by their rules and wins every time. But, there are schemes and more schemes which might just bring Lou's comfortable world down around her. Strangely enough, there's a preacher at a mission next door who fascinates her no end - he's not her normal type, being more interested in souls than bodies. There's more to him than meets the eye!Well, I must start out by saying that Mae West has always fascinated me. She knew herself and her times more than anyone else before or since. She knew what she wanted, and she knew how to get it. But getting back to the movie, I found that she did a great job of portraying a ""fallen"" woman of the stage, keeping her male patrons sexually charged, yet never losing their respect for her or her respect for herself.The male characters in the movie are more truly props, being around to cast their light on Lady Lou. Nonetheless, newly-minted actor Cary Grant shows off the charm and presence that made him a superstar in later movies. The story is somewhat simple, but Mae West's playful sexuality captures the camera, and keeps it pointed right where she wanted it - on her.This is a very good movie, one that is sure to delight any modern viewer who likes old-time movies - especially pre-Production Code gems. I really recommend that you check this movie out, you'll love it!(Review of She Done Him Wrong starring Mae West and Cary Grant)",5,Sure to delight,1242777600,"05 20, 2009",2009,1542,"['Lady', 'Lou', 'belle', 'Gus', 'Jordan', 'Bowery', 'saloon', 'voice', 'figure', 'man', 'heart', 'throbbing', 'woman', 'man', 'world', 'plays', 'rules', 'wins', 'time', 'are', 'schemes', 'more', 'schemes', 'might', 'just', 'bring', 'Lou', 'comfortable', 'world', 'down', 'Strangely', 'enough', 'preacher', 'mission', 'next', 'door', 'who', 'end', 'not', 'normal', 'type', 'being', 'more', 'interested', 'souls', 'bodies', 'more', 'eye', 'Well', 'must', 'start', 'out', 'saying', 'Mae', 'West', 'always', 'fascinated', 'knew', 'times', 'more', 'anyone', 'else', 'knew', 'what', 'wanted', 'knew', 'how', 'get', 'getting', 'back', 'movie', 'found', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'fallen', 'woman', 'stage', 'keeping', 'male', 'patrons', 'sexually', 'charged', 'yet', 'never', 'losing', 'respect', 'respect', 'herself.The', 'male', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'more', 'truly', 'props', 'being', 'cast', 'light', 'Lady', 'Lou', 'Nonetheless', 'newly-minted', 'actor', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'charm', 'presence', 'made', 'superstar', 'later', 'movies', 'story', 'somewhat', 'simple', 'Mae', 'West', 'playful', 'sexuality', 'camera', 'pointed', 'right', 'where', 'wanted', 'her.This', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'one', 'sure', 'delight', 'modern', 'viewer', 'who', 'old-time', 'movies', 'especially', 'pre-Production', 'Code', 'really', 'recommend', 'check', 'movie', 'out', ""'ll"", 'love', 'Review', 'Done', 'Him', 'Wrong', 'starring', 'Mae', 'West', 'Cary', 'Grant']",She Done Him Wrong VHS

In it, she co-stars with a very young and boyish Cary Grant, and while their physical pairing doesn't entirely sit well, their sizzling chemistry more than compensates.Mae West is Lady Lou, the reigning singing star of the Bowery.  Although she's wooed and adored by just about every man that crosses her path, Lou wants the unattainable: Captain Cummings (Cary Grant), the local mission director.  In a plot overflowing with jailed former lovers, stolen diamonds and a Barbary Coast white slavery outfit, will Lou land her handsome Captain?  Watch and find out...In SHE DONE HIM WRONG, Mae West cemented the archetypal character she'd more or less reprise in all of her subsequent movies.  Cary Grant perfectly pairs her, and the two would be reunited in West's next movie, ""I'm No Angel"" (released later the same year), an even bigger hit which helped pull Universal Studios out of it's financial reverses.Mae West sings ""A Guy What Takes His Time"", ""She Done Him Wrong"", ""Frankie & Johnny"", and ""Easy Rider"".

Even those of you who haven't, you must of heard some of her witty ""West-isms"".West plays Lady Lou, a saloon singer who wears low cut, form-fitting gowns and drips with glittering diamonds. A woman who becomes the object of desire for every person of the opposite sex. A gold-digger with a shady past and a heart of gold.Mae was almost 40 when she made this film and it's apparent in some (if not most) of her scenes. But despite all of her physical shortcomings, she still manages to convince some of us of her sexual expertise. It's all in her mannerisms, her ""purr"" and her stroll. The woman just oozes sex and her over-sized, hour glass figure in some scenes is spectacular. As one critic stated she is ""the BIG BEN of hour glass figures"".This beloved classic offer's some of her best one-liners ever and some of the smartest dialoge to ever grace the silver screen. A scene that comes to mind is when Lady Lou comes to the aid of a young lady who tried to kill herself, West asks:""What's wrong...commited murder?""GIRL: ""No and I never will.""MAE: ""Well you've got nothing to worry about. At least the guys alive.""GIRL: ""How did you know there was a man?""MAE: ""There always is. You know it takes two to get one in trouble.""GIRL: ""You know everything about me.""MAE: ""I wouldn't say that but I am observant..... what was he, married?.""GIRL: ""Yes but I didn't know... I didn't know.""MAE: ""It makes no difference to me whether you did or not. It's their game. I just happen to be smart enough to play it their way. You'll come to it.""A bit later on the young girl asks:  ""Who'd want me after what I've done?"".To which West replies: ""When woman go wrong men go right after them.""Another classic moment is when West's maid states: "" ...if something were to happen, I wouldn't want no policeman to catch me without no petticoats."" To which West says: ""No policeman, how about a nice fireman?"".This film was actually considered ""pornographic"" by some at the time. The only thing sexual about the film is Mae West's appearance and of course, her innuendos. It is a shame that many of her films were heavily edited and some of her best one-liner's were left on the cutting room floor.This was West's first starring feature and it's one of her best. It's ""larger-than -life"" star steals the show and those who have not seen this classic are sure missing out.So do yourselves a favour and ""go up and see her"".

206440,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,6300186016,"""flickjunkie""","[8, 8]","Mae West was a veteran of burlesque, vaudeville and the Broadway stage by the time she made her first film in 1932 at the age of 39.  ""She Done Him Wrong"" was her second film and her first starring role in an adaptation of her smash Broadway hit ""Diamond Lil"".  It was a play that West had written herself and it played to packed houses on Broadway for years.  This film was nominated for an Academy Award for best picture and made Cary Grant into an instant star.  Mae went on to write nine of the fourteen screenplays for films in which she was to star.  Thus, all those great quotes we've heard that are attributed to her were not only said by her, but written by her as well.  By 1935, she was the most highly paid woman in America.  To this day, she remains one of the female stars most often imitated by female impersonators.This film is among her best.  It is full of the bawdy double entendre that became her trademark.  She was the queen of sexual innuendo and suggestive dialogue and many of her lines have become part of Americana (e.g. ""Is that a gun in your pocket or are you just glad to see me?""  And, ""A hard man is good to find.""  And of course, ""Come up and see me sometime."")The plot of this film is simplistic and it is clearly a vehicle for her enormous talent, leading up to the now famous proposal by Cary Grant at the end of the film.  Mae commands every frame of the film with her incomparable combination of sex appeal and ribald humor.  Her sense of comic timing is impeccable making the funny lines she writes that much more hilarious by the snide way in which she delivers them.Before this film, Cary Grant had appeared in half a dozen films and was building a reputation as a solid actor.  However, none of his early films gave him the exposure that this film did due to its wild popularity at the time.  West handpicked him for the part saying that he combined virility with the bearing of a gentleman.  She wanted someone who would epitomize the now famous line, ""Hello, warm, dark and handsome.""  Though his role in this film is minor compared to West's, it made him a household name and a bankable star.This classic film is a piece of film history that shouldn't be missed.  I rated it a 10/10.  It is among Mae West's best moments.

Taylor ""GFT""","[26, 27]","Mae West had a Broadway smash when she penned the bawdy tale of DIAMOND LIL for herself--and with a few tweaks here and there the story came to the screen as SHE DONE HIM WRONG.  The film was an immediate hit and the role of Lady Lou remains one of West's best remembered performances. The script is jam-packed with some of West's most famous lines, including the memorable &quot;Come up'n see me sometime.  I'm home every evenin'&quot; and &quot;You can be had.&quot;  West throws her lines with style, aplomb, enough innuendo to make a censor cringe, and considerable humor--but, somewhat surprisingly, the movie is not really a comedy.SHE DONE HIM WRONG is a hard-knocks tale of Bowery bruisers who dance attendance upon the 'Lady Lou' and often resort to crime to keep her dripping in the diamonds she prizes above all else. But although she has one lover already locked up in jail, another one mixed up in the white slavery rackets, and still a third waiting to step into the gap, the Lady Lou is more interested in seducing missionary Cary Grant... only to find him less interested in her body than her soul, a circumstance that prompts West to utter one of the most how-did-that-get-past-the-censors lines in 1930s cinema: &quot;Maybe I ain't got no soul.&quot;This is a surprisingly tough little movie, and in addition to West's zinging lines and occasional musical numbers SHE DONE HIM WRONG also offers a glimpse at a very young (and still slightly wooden) Cary Grant; it also has an ensemble cast that plays in a very enjoyable grand manner, truly first rate production values all the way, and A surprisingly brisk running time.

206447,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,6300186016,James Morris,"[42, 42]","I greet the release of She Done Him Wrong on DVD with mixed emotions.First, my review of the film - She Done Him Wrong was Mae West's personal favorite among her 12 movies, and 75 years after its release, it is still considered a classic by most critics and many fans.  The film is often credited with saving Paramount Studios from bankruptcy, and made Mae West the box-office sensation of 1933.  Thanks to this film, the phrase, ""Come up and see me sometime"" entered the language and immortalized a woman now long-revered for her comic timing and salty double-entendres (although her most famous phrase was something of a misquote; her actual line to Cary Grant was, ""Why don't `cha come up sometime, see me?  Don't be afraid, I won't tell.  Come up, I'll tell your fortune.  Ooohh, you can be had!"").  Based on her notorious Broadway smash Diamond Lil, Miss West was forced to change the lead character's name (if not the basic plot) to appease the censors, and Diamond Lil became Lady Lou, ""One of the finest women ever walked the streets"".  Peppered with hilarious bons mots such as, ""When women go wrong, men go right after them"", the script, which she wrote herself, contains more wit in each scene than some modern so-called comedies have in a whole movie.  For a film that runs a mere 62 minutes, it's packed with fun, drama, wonderful period atmosphere and great performances from an ensemble cast, many of whom appeared in the stage version.  Mae's sultry singing of the song, ""A Guy What Takes His Time"" was so suggestive that the censors removed all but one verse of it from her filmed rendition, although she managed somehow to simultaneously release it on a 78 record that contained verse after verse of uncensored, ribald, raw sexuality.While I am thrilled to finally have this movie available on DVD, it dashes my hopes that some of Mae West's more obscure films will ever find a digital release.Universal Studios (who owns the rights to all Paramount titles) previously released on individual DVD's only three Mae West classic titles: I'm No Angel (1933), Belle of the Nineties (1934), and Klondike Annie (1937).  Each of these early DVD releases has been long out of print.  Early in 2005, My Little Chickadee (1940) was released as part of the W. C. Fields collection, and later that year, Universal released five titles in the ""Mae West Glamour Collection"", Night After Night (1932), Go West, Young Man (1935), Goin' To Town (1936) and the previously mentioned I'm No Angel and My Little Chickadee.  I was hoping that a ""Mae West Glamour Collection, Volume Two"" would eventually contain the out-of-print Belle of the Nineties and Klondike Annie, along with She Done Him Wrong, and her remaining two classic films, Every Day's A Holiday (1937) and the rarely seen, The Heat's On (1943), both of which have never been on DVD at all.  Curiously enough, the UK version of the Mae West Classic Collection included The Heat's On, although it was originally released by Columbia; I guess this means that Universal does have the rights.  BUT, the release of She Done Him Wrong as a single DVD has now dashed my hopes that the other classic titles will ever be released.  This is a pity.  Some critics - and I concur - consider Klondike Annie (more of a drama than a comedy) to be Mae's finest effort, and Every Day's A Holiday is one of her more hilarious outings on celluloid.I am hoping against hope that this release signals the forthcoming issue of the few of Mae West's classics that have not been seen in a digital format, but only time will tell.",5,Good News or Bad?

It is one of three Mae West ""essentials""; the other two being I'M NO ANGEL and MY LITTLE CHICKADEE (with WC Fields, no less!) Mae West was camp before there was camp. Bette Middler based many of routines on West. Heck, even Salvador Dali painted her. I think he appreciated her surrealistic possibilities.Her movies are confected like a gaudy, glittering cake with Mae West as the roman candle in the center just about to go off. What's really funny about her plays & movies is that in each one the males are falling all over themselves just to bask in Mae's sexual awesomeness.In reality she was short and...well, rather plump. Her face was more matron than vamp. If you watch her walk, it has a striding effect, and you never see her feet because she wore platform shoes that were like stilts. West kept them concealed beneath eye-popping gowns with enormously long ""trains."". In I'M NO ANGEL West enters a circus ring riding on an elephant--and maybe for the first time, her partner (the elephant) is wearing more jewels than Mae. She finishes the circus act by putting her head inside a lions' mouth! She strides into a scene, plants herself down, and lets her eyes, abundant curves, & innuendos work their magic. Even her singing voice is technically only so-so, but it doesn't matter because it's all part of the package. I love her song routines.

Sherwin,"[3, 4]","She Done Him Wrong showcases Mae West's fantastic talent as a seductive actress; she plays Lady Lou in a New York saloon where the men come to drink beer and fight over her. Cary Grant plays Captain Cummings from the mission next door; and the list of men who want time with Lady Lou is long enough to fill a phone book! The action moves along at a good pace with a few plot twists and unexpected surprises; this is one of Mae West's better films.The action begins in the saloon where Lady Lou sings and has her home with Gus Jordan (Noah Beery) whose protection she gets while her former boyfriend Chick Clark (Owen Moore) does time in jail. Chick thinks Lou is being faithful to him while he is in jail; but the truth is anything but that. Lou fools around with Gus Jordan and gets chased by both Dan Flynn (David Landau) and Serge Stanieff (Gilbert Roland), all the while wanting to spend some time alone with Captain Cummings (Cary Grant) from the mission next door.Lady Lou sings three songs in this film including ""A Guy What Takes His Time;"" but that's not why you want to watch this film. Watch this film for the zesty one liners from Lady Lou and her interactions with the numerous men in her life including Captain Cummings. Awesome! Look also for a solid performance by Louise Beavers as Lady Lou's maid Pearl.The choreography is great in the bar hall scenes and the cinematography works wonders especially in the scenes which involve panning the bar hall and the jail.Whatever you do, DON'T miss this film. She Done Him Wrong provides you with action, laughs, terrific one liners from West and a musical number or two when West warbles her way through a song. It seems so odd that this film, considered relatively tame by today's standards, was essentially the final straw that started the motion picture Production Code; but those were much different times.Enjoy!",5,"when women go wrong, men go right after them...",1187740800,"08 22, 2007",2007,1876,"['Done', 'Him', 'Wrong', 'Mae', 'West', 'fantastic', 'talent', 'seductive', 'actress', 'Lady', 'Lou', 'New', 'York', 'saloon', 'where', 'men', 'come', 'drink', 'beer', 'fight', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Captain', 'Cummings', 'mission', 'next', 'door', 'list', 'men', 'who', 'want', 'time', 'Lady', 'Lou', 'long', 'enough', 'fill', 'phone', 'book', 'action', 'along', 'good', 'pace', 'few', 'plot', 'twists', 'unexpected', 'surprises', 'one', 'Mae', 'West', 'better', 'films.The', 'action', 'saloon', 'where', 'Lady', 'Lou', 'sings', 'home', 'Gus', 'Jordan', 'Noah', 'Beery', 'protection', 'former', 'boyfriend', 'Chick', 'Clark', 'Owen', 'Moore', 'time', 'jail', 'Chick', 'Lou', 'being', 'faithful', 'jail', 'truth', 'anything', 'Lou', 'Gus', 'Jordan', 'chased', 'Dan', 'Flynn', 'David', 'Landau', 'Serge', 'Stanieff', 'Gilbert', 'Roland', 'while', 'wanting', 'spend', 'time', 'alone', 'Captain', 'Cummings', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'mission', 'door.Lady', 'Lou', 'sings', 'three', 'songs', 'film', 'including', 'Guy', 'What', 'Time', 'not', 'why', 'want', 'watch', 'film', 'Watch', 'film', 'zesty', 'one', 'liners', 'Lady', 'Lou', 'interactions', 'numerous', 'men', 'life', 'including', 'Captain', 'Cummings', 'Awesome', 'Look', 'also', 'solid', 'performance', 'Louise', 'Beavers', 'Lady', 'Lou', 'maid', 'Pearl.The', 'choreography', 'great', 'bar', 'hall', 'scenes', 'cinematography', 'wonders', 'especially', 'scenes', 'involve', 'panning', 'bar', 'hall', 'jail.Whatever', 'do', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'miss', 'film', 'Done', 'Him', 'Wrong', 'action', 'one', 'liners', 'West', 'musical', 'number', 'two', 'when', 'West', 'way', 'song', 'so', 'odd', 'film', 'considered', 'relatively', 'tame', 'today', 'standards', 'was', 'essentially', 'final', 'straw', 'started', 'motion', 'picture', 'Production', 'Code', 'were', 'much', 'different', 'times.Enjoy']",She Done Him Wrong VHS

It was her first leading role in a film. Based on West's hit play ""Diamond Lil"", tempered somewhat to please the censors, audiences loved the double entendres and West's trashy glamour. It was a box office smash that reputedly saved Paramount from bankruptcy. In 1934, ""She Done Him Wrong"" became the shortest film ever nominated for a Best Picture Oscar, at 1 hour 6 minutes, as well as one of the few comedies to receive that honor.In the Bowery district of 1890s New York, political boss and racketeer Gus Jordan (Noah Beery) is the envy of every man who visits his cabaret, not for his wealth or power, but for his mistress Lady Lou (Mae West). Lou is a saucy singer who does gold-diggers one better. ""Diamonds is my career,"" she declares. She'll attach herself to any man who is willing to deck her out in the gems. But Lou finds herself coveted by all the wrong men -not that she discourages them. The only man able to resist her charms is the handsome young Captain Cummings (Cary Grant) from the charitable mission next door...or can he.""She Done Him Wrong"" opens with 10 minutes of praise for Lady Lou's beauty and charm spoken by men from every walk of life before the Lady herself makes an appearance. That kind of introduction is difficult to live up to, and she doesn't quite manage, but Mae West is a larger than life presence who speaks in suggestive quips, drips diamonds, and slinks around in gowns that she had to be sewn into.  West excelled in making disreputable women irresistible, and it's amazing to see what the force of her personality can do. ""She Done Him Wrong"" has an interesting set-up with very little pay-off, but there's no denying Mae West's entertainment value.The DVD (Universal 2008): This is a good print of the film, with no obvious flaws in picture or sound. There is an optional Introduction (2 min) by Robert Osborne, who talks briefly about how the film saved Paramount and the changes that were made from the play. There is also a black-and-white animated short from 1933 entitled ""She Done Him Right"" (8 min) featuring Pooch the Pup. Clearly inspired by Mae West's film, Pooch pursues a slinky cabaret singer named Poodles, who spoofs Lady Lou.

Halford ""Comedy Fan""","[5, 5]","Never having seen ""She Done Him Wrong"" before (although I've heard plenty about its notoriety), I was pleased to find Mae West in top form. Yet another film based upon her notorious stage plays, it must've had quite an impact on audiences when it debuted. Although Miss West was not the first female comedian (Mabel Normand was there long before her), she was important in film history as the first female character which was strongly assertive. When others did her wrong, Mae was quick in putting them in their place with a suggestive comment or sharp one-liner. After spending years on the stage, Mae was an old pro at tossing out bawdy one-liners with ease, a trademark of her character. And she could speak volumes with just a roll of her eyes or sway of her hips; quite a contrast from today's actresses who must engage in graphic sex scenes or bare all to get our attention.Armed with a strong script & surrounded with a solid cast (the young, handsome Cary Grant, Gilbert Roland, Noah Beery, Sr., etc.), Mae entered into a confrontation with the Censorship Bureau over the film's content---the first of many battles for her. Ultimately (and obviously), the film was made, was a box office smash, and saved Paramount Pictures from the brink of bankruptcy. Quit an impact, indeed!Balancing comedy & drama, SDHW sets the mold for many vehicles in which Mae's character was continually assaulted because of her ""past"", but she always won out due to her unflappable manner & deep-down integrity. Singing & talking in her husky, slightly nasally voice, Mae was certainly impressionable.Handsomely packaged & remastered, the DVD also includes a dandy introduction from Robert Osbourne, as well as an early cartoon clearly patterned after Miss West titled ""She Done Him Right"".

Paramount obviously spent a fortune on the production and thankfully the MCA VHS print is magnificent.It is also of interest in being one of Cary Grants earlier films but he appears quite stiff throughout the film and is no where near the totally charming performer he became later in the late 30's and 40'sI enjoy this film very much and I recommend it to those that enjoy a good fun time at the movies",5,What a hoot of a film!,1015113600,"03 3, 2002",2002,928,"['film', 'real', 'tickler', 'funny', 'bone', 'Mae', 'West', 'was', 'absolute', 'peak', 'when', 'made', 'film', 'first', 'major', 'starring', 'role', 'Many', 'famous', 'one', 'liners', 'are', 'here', 'are', 'guaranteed', 'keep', 'laughing', '70', 'so', 'minute', 'running', 'time.As', 'saying', 'dont', 'make', 'films', 'anymore', 'pity', 'believe', 'sexual', 'underplay', 'here', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'today', 'films', 'where', 'everything', 'thrown', 'face.The', 'overraul', 'look', 'film', 'authentic', 'very', 'lavish', 'Paramount', 'obviously', 'spent', 'fortune', 'production', 'thankfully', 'MCA', 'VHS', 'print', 'magnificent.It', 'also', 'interest', 'being', 'one', 'Cary', 'Grants', 'earlier', 'films', 'quite', 'stiff', 'film', 'where', 'totally', 'charming', 'performer', 'became', 'later', 'late', '30', ""40'sI"", 'enjoy', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'recommend', 'enjoy', 'good', 'fun', 'time', 'movies']",She Done Him Wrong VHS

As a fan of the classics, I had heard a lot about her, but had seen absolutely none of her films. She Done Him Wrong (1933) provides her first starring role as Lady Lou, a woman based on her famous Diamond Lil character. This runs a mere 60 minutes and has a rather unfocused but quite interesting plot. It teams the legendary Miss West with newcomer Cary Grant, who she claims to have &#34;discovered&#34; for the movie, claiming up until that time he done &#34;some tests with starlets&#34;. This is untrue, Mr. Grant had become a well-known actor in 1932 with Blonde Venus opposite Marlene Dietrich. She Done Him Wrong is not the perfect movie by any means, but its a quite intriguing one.Signed: TheClassicsNut65",4,"""Why don't you come up sometime and see me?""",1404691200,"07 7, 2014",2014,741,"['Mae', 'West', 'camp', 'icon', 'fan', 'classics', 'had', 'heard', 'lot', 'had', 'seen', 'absolutely', 'none', 'films', 'Done', 'Him', 'Wrong', '1933', 'first', 'starring', 'role', 'Lady', 'Lou', 'woman', 'based', 'famous', 'Diamond', 'Lil', 'character', 'mere', '60', 'minutes', 'rather', 'unfocused', 'quite', 'interesting', 'plot', 'legendary', 'Miss', 'West', 'newcomer', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'who', 'have', '34', 'discovered', '34', 'movie', 'claiming', 'up', 'time', 'done', '34', 'tests', 'starlets', '34', 'untrue', 'Mr.', 'Grant', 'had', 'become', 'well-known', 'actor', '1932', 'Blonde', 'Venus', 'opposite', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'Done', 'Him', 'Wrong', 'not', 'perfect', 'movie', 'means', 'quite', 'intriguing', 'one.Signed', 'TheClassicsNut65']",She Done Him Wrong VHS
