998082,A25JH6CO4DVINS,B000G1ALQQ,Junglies,"[2, 14]","This show should have been relegated to the lower divisions at the end of the second season. What started out as a not bad idea has been giving away penalties since the beginning of the match and this season should have certainly been sent off if the referee had been keeping his eye on the ball.Much of the impetus for this season has been the inclusion of a transfer in player who, it is claimed is based on the life of David Beckham. Certainly it has enabled the writers to give additional dimensions to the series but as the game rolls on the more preposterous it gets.There is a little more than a token nod to actual football throughout the performance but some of the central plots are a little lame and should have been stretchered off. The main players lack a bad boy as a mainstay and tania and hazel are not quite the best substitutes for that.This remains chav heaven and clearly includes a lot of titillation. The new girl, the scouser (Liverpudlian) is pathetically annoying and her voice grates while the character of Amber could have been more interesting.The main appeal of this show lies in it's tawdriness, but it will require more than just that if it is to continue into extra time, now that all of the available substitutes have been used up.",3,scoring an own goal,1161907200,"10 27, 2006",2006,1264,"['show', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'relegated', 'lower', 'divisions', 'end', 'second', 'season', 'What', 'started', 'out', 'not', 'bad', 'idea', 'been', 'giving', 'away', 'penalties', 'beginning', 'match', 'season', 'should', 'have', 'certainly', 'been', 'sent', 'off', 'referee', 'had', 'been', 'keeping', 'eye', 'ball.Much', 'impetus', 'season', 'been', 'inclusion', 'transfer', 'player', 'who', 'claimed', 'based', 'life', 'David', 'Beckham', 'Certainly', 'enabled', 'writers', 'give', 'additional', 'dimensions', 'series', 'game', 'more', 'preposterous', 'little', 'more', 'token', 'nod', 'actual', 'football', 'performance', 'central', 'plots', 'are', 'little', 'lame', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'stretchered', 'off', 'main', 'players', 'lack', 'bad', 'boy', 'mainstay', 'tania', 'hazel', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'best', 'substitutes', 'that.This', 'chav', 'heaven', 'clearly', 'lot', 'titillation', 'new', 'girl', 'scouser', 'Liverpudlian', 'pathetically', 'annoying', 'voice', 'grates', 'character', 'Amber', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting.The', 'main', 'appeal', 'show', 'tawdriness', 'will', 'require', 'more', 'just', 'continue', 'extra', 'time', 'now', 'available', 'substitutes', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'up']",Footballers Wives - The Complete Third Season

998084,A22TZUXUKA11SQ,B000G1ALQQ,"K. Hinton ""avid reader""","[16, 16]","Much like the who shot JR story line on Dallas, you would think that after the second season cliffhanger the biggest question surrounding the third season of Footballer's Wives would be who killed Jason Turner. You would be wrong. In fact, that question is answered on the very first episode of this season. Instead, the focus of the third season of Footballer's Wives is on the new recruits to Earls Park and their interactions with the old favorites--like Tanya Turner.The new blood on the team includes:Conrad and Amber Gates: Conrad is pretty much the David Beckham of the team. He's got the looks, the body, and the has-been wife... but not the kids. Amber's a former Bollywood actress who is having more than a little trouble getting any work.  Conrad and Amber have an open marriage and Conrad makes it no secret that he plays the field. He may have met his match, though, when Tanya sets her sights on him.Harvey Lawson and his girlfriend Shannon: Harvey is a seventeen year old kid who proves that age really doesn't matter on the pitch. His girlfriend Shannon is a bit country and not at all up to par with the other footballer's wives. She's also jealous, possessive, and can't hold her liquor, which makes for excellent television where this show is concerned.Noah Alexander: Noah fills in when one of the show's key players is injured, but causes more than a little scandal when his personal life starts to overshadow his performance on the pitch. When he gets in the way of what Tanya wants, she puts him in his place quickly and let him know who's boss at Earls Park.There is nothing that the writers of this show will not do. There isn't an American equivalent to the over-the-top campiness of this show, Desperate Housewives and Passions included. It's almost too much sometimes, but I just can't look away. If you've never seen Footballer's Wives cocaine addiction, hermaphrodite babies, and gambling addiction are just a few of the story lines you have to look forward to if you give this show a chance.  If you enjoyed seasons 1 and 2, I can guarantee that you won't be disappointed with this season. The only problem is the length of time it takes the American DVDs to be released. They're already on season 5 in Britain, and it'll probably be another year or so before we get those on DVD.",5,There is nothing this show won't do,1159660800,"10 1, 2006",2006,2311,"['Much', 'who', 'shot', 'JR', 'story', 'line', 'Dallas', 'would', 'think', 'second', 'season', 'cliffhanger', 'biggest', 'question', 'surrounding', 'third', 'season', 'Footballer', 'Wives', 'would', 'be', 'who', 'killed', 'Jason', 'Turner', 'would', 'be', 'wrong', 'fact', 'question', 'answered', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'season', 'Instead', 'focus', 'third', 'season', 'Footballer', 'Wives', 'new', 'recruits', 'Earls', 'Park', 'interactions', 'old', 'favorites', 'Tanya', 'Turner.The', 'new', 'blood', 'team', 'Conrad', 'Amber', 'Gates', 'Conrad', 'pretty', 'much', 'David', 'Beckham', 'team', 'got', 'looks', 'body', 'has-been', 'wife', 'not', 'kids', 'Amber', 'former', 'Bollywood', 'actress', 'who', 'having', 'more', 'little', 'trouble', 'getting', 'work', 'Conrad', 'Amber', 'have', 'open', 'marriage', 'Conrad', 'secret', 'field', 'may', 'have', 'met', 'match', 'though', 'when', 'Tanya', 'sights', 'him.Harvey', 'Lawson', 'girlfriend', 'Shannon', 'Harvey', 'seventeen', 'year', 'old', 'kid', 'who', 'age', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'pitch', 'girlfriend', 'Shannon', 'bit', 'country', 'not', 'up', 'par', 'other', 'footballer', 'wives', 'also', 'jealous', 'possessive', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'liquor', 'excellent', 'television', 'where', 'show', 'concerned.Noah', 'Alexander', 'Noah', 'fills', 'when', 'one', 'show', 'key', 'players', 'injured', 'more', 'little', 'scandal', 'when', 'personal', 'life', 'overshadow', 'performance', 'pitch', 'When', 'way', 'what', 'Tanya', 'place', 'quickly', 'let', 'know', 'who', 'boss', 'Earls', 'Park.There', 'nothing', 'writers', 'show', 'will', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'American', 'equivalent', 'over-the-top', 'campiness', 'show', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'Passions', 'included', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'sometimes', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'look', 'away', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Footballer', 'Wives', 'cocaine', 'addiction', 'hermaphrodite', 'babies', 'gambling', 'addiction', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'story', 'lines', 'have', 'look', 'forward', 'give', 'show', 'chance', 'enjoyed', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'can', 'guarantee', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'season', 'only', 'problem', 'length', 'time', 'American', 'DVDs', 'be', 'released', ""'re"", 'already', 'season', '5', 'Britain', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'year', 'so', 'get', 'DVD']",Footballers Wives - The Complete Third Season
