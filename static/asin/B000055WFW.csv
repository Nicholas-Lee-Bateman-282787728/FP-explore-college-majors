What is fascinating is that there is so much more to it than I knew about when I was involved in the anti-war movement back in the 1960s. I didn't go to Chicago in 1968, because I was on probation (possession of marijuana) and my probation officer swore she would do something terrible if I went and got myself busted again.Take me for a coward, but I spent one afternoon in jail, met my room-mate, and knew I would not be allowed to sleep in peace. Fortunately, my friends bailed me out before I had to stay overnight. That was plenty for me. Hell, the strip search was enough for me.Anyway, Abbie had a lot more courage than I did. He was willing to do truly crazy things as Street Theater, as consciousness-raising, as a way to get attention to the power trips Mayor Daley was using in Chicago to break up the anti-war protests. And as everyone knows, he and the Chicago Seven got arrested for conspiracy to riot. In fact, that trial was about the last I heard anything much about Abbie.When he got out on bail after his appeal, he ""went underground,"" which meant leaving his activist wife Anita and their baby, named america. (Yes, lower-case.) He was followed and harassed by the FBI, the CIA, and DEA, among others. When they knew where he was, they tapped his phone. His wife's phone was tapped, she was followed, his attorney was watched, and so on.He became Barry Freed and eventually fell in love with a blond Scandinavian girl who knew him by that name. He told her who he really was, but she continued to call him Barry. He took some pretty amazing chances to see his son (who did not know he was really his father), and to visit with Anita.There's more, lots more. But eventually, with the help of a friend who was a Newsweek reporter, he revealed enough about the FBI's counter intelligence program, including a lot of surveillance that was strictly illegal, and his lawyer was able to cut a deal for him to turn himself in and have his sentence revised to time already served.And of course he went right back to community organizing, this time in the Save the River campaign to protect the St. Lawrence River.When he died, the coroner decided it was suicide.

567011,A2KG8WLR1AKO12,B000055WFW,"David Thomson ""Second Rate Eric Hoffer Imitator""","[2, 10]","Vincent D'Onofrio portrays Abbie Hoffman as a physically courageous but confused individual who took himself far too seriously. Abbie declared himself to be a fighter for freedom and justice. Regrettably, though, the enunciated premises of Hoffman's political theories inadvertently lead to Nihilism. Our protagonist was unable to realize that a certain degree of dispassionate objectivity towards the faults and weaknesses of both your enemies and friends is mandatory if one desires to avoid slipping into madness. Hoffman's writings were banal and immature. He did not possess the ability to make distinctions and comprehend the nuances required of a insightful political philosopher. Advocating shoplifting in stores, for example, hardly sustains a viable social order. Did D'Onofrio indulge in histrionic overkill? I was a politically disinterested teenager during the Sixties, but if my memory can be trusted it seemed that Hoffman had a more comedic side to him which is not reflected in the film.Janeane Garofalo deserved consideration for an Academy Award nomination for her interpretation of Hoffman's wife Anita. Garofalo's appearance in this movie alone could justify its viewing for those who merely want to see a fine actress at her best. She is believable as the wife who cooperates with her husband's mistress in keeping Abbie out of harm's way. Garofalo's Anita is not bitter or envious of Abbie's new love relationship. My gut instincts tempt me to conclude that this is likely the way the real Anita responded to her predicament. The roles of Jerry Rubin, Bobby Seale and other notable Yippies are too shallowly drawn to be of value.This movie needed to be limited to a ninety minutes TV drama. The last hour of &quot;Steal This Book&quot; especially could have been cut to fifteen minutes. Hoffman achieved his place in the sun during the anti-Vietnam War years. The period when Hoffman was on the run is not germane. Historians will have only a mild interest in the Chicago Seven trial (There was no miscarriage of justice in this particular instance. Hoffman and his cronies acted like jerks, and the judge merely performed his duty). The violations of their civil rights by the FBI and other police agencies are alas another matter. This aspect of the story deserves its own full length movie. Nonetheless, it is also imperative not to overlook the cold fact that while we must condemn the disgusting actions of these government officials--in a truly totalitarian society, Abbie Hoffman and his cohorts would have been exterminated. The Yippie leader thankfully never acquired any real power. Our political system and institutions acted as a brake on Hoffman's baser inclinations. &quot;Steal This Book&quot; is recommended for those interested in understanding a bit more about the radical Yippies. It is not a great movie, but it helps to fill in some of the gaps. I give it three stars.",3,&quot;Steal This Book&quot; Recalls the Nihilism of the Yippies,984268800,"03 11, 2001",2001,2912,"['Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'Abbie', 'Hoffman', 'physically', 'courageous', 'confused', 'individual', 'who', 'took', 'far', 'too', 'seriously', 'Abbie', 'declared', 'be', 'fighter', 'freedom', 'justice', 'Regrettably', 'enunciated', 'premises', 'Hoffman', 'political', 'theories', 'inadvertently', 'lead', 'Nihilism', 'protagonist', 'was', 'unable', 'realize', 'certain', 'degree', 'dispassionate', 'objectivity', 'faults', 'weaknesses', 'enemies', 'friends', 'mandatory', 'one', 'avoid', 'slipping', 'madness', 'Hoffman', 'writings', 'were', 'banal', 'immature', 'did', 'not', 'possess', 'ability', 'make', 'distinctions', 'comprehend', 'nuances', 'required', 'insightful', 'political', 'philosopher', 'Advocating', 'shoplifting', 'stores', 'example', 'hardly', 'viable', 'social', 'order', 'Did', ""D'Onofrio"", 'indulge', 'histrionic', 'overkill', 'was', 'politically', 'disinterested', 'teenager', 'Sixties', 'memory', 'can', 'be', 'trusted', 'seemed', 'Hoffman', 'had', 'more', 'comedic', 'side', 'not', 'reflected', 'film.Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'deserved', 'consideration', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'interpretation', 'Hoffman', 'wife', 'Anita', 'Garofalo', 'appearance', 'movie', 'alone', 'could', 'justify', 'viewing', 'who', 'merely', 'want', 'see', 'fine', 'actress', 'best', 'believable', 'wife', 'who', 'husband', 'mistress', 'keeping', 'Abbie', 'harm', 'way', 'Garofalo', 'Anita', 'not', 'bitter', 'envious', 'Abbie', 'new', 'love', 'relationship', 'gut', 'instincts', 'tempt', 'conclude', 'likely', 'way', 'real', 'Anita', 'responded', 'predicament', 'roles', 'Jerry', 'Rubin', 'Bobby', 'Seale', 'other', 'notable', 'Yippies', 'are', 'too', 'shallowly', 'drawn', 'be', 'value.This', 'movie', 'needed', 'be', 'limited', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'TV', 'drama', 'last', 'hour', 'quot', 'Steal', 'Book', 'quot', 'especially', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'Hoffman', 'achieved', 'place', 'sun', 'anti-Vietnam', 'War', 'years', 'period', 'when', 'Hoffman', 'was', 'run', 'not', 'germane', 'Historians', 'will', 'have', 'only', 'mild', 'interest', 'Chicago', 'Seven', 'trial', 'was', 'miscarriage', 'justice', 'particular', 'instance', 'Hoffman', 'cronies', 'acted', 'jerks', 'judge', 'merely', 'performed', 'duty', 'violations', 'civil', 'rights', 'FBI', 'other', 'police', 'agencies', 'are', 'alas', 'matter', 'aspect', 'story', 'own', 'full', 'length', 'movie', 'Nonetheless', 'also', 'imperative', 'not', 'overlook', 'cold', 'fact', 'must', 'condemn', 'disgusting', 'actions', 'government', 'officials', 'truly', 'totalitarian', 'society', 'Abbie', 'Hoffman', 'cohorts', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'exterminated', 'Yippie', 'leader', 'thankfully', 'never', 'acquired', 'real', 'power', 'political', 'system', 'institutions', 'acted', 'brake', 'Hoffman', 'baser', 'inclinations', 'quot', 'Steal', 'Book', 'quot', 'recommended', 'interested', 'understanding', 'bit', 'more', 'radical', 'Yippies', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'fill', 'gaps', 'give', 'three', 'stars']",N/A

However, when you're working with a script from the Acme Screenplay Co. that portrays Abbie Hoffman as the Roadrunner and the U.S. Government as Wile E. Coyote, your credibility goes sailing right over that cliff. D'Onofrio, who can be brilliant with the right script or director (&quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;, &quot;The Whole Wide World&quot;) might want to shop around for a new agent. He projects obvious enthusiasm for the character, but the lack of attention to other details of the production provides little support for his earnestness. Garofalo is convincingly down to earth as Anita Hoffman, but ultimately isn't given much to do beyond the cliche Concerned Wife routines. Like the theatrical release &quot;Panther&quot; and the TV miniseries &quot;The 60's&quot;, &quot;Steal This Movie&quot; is yet one more case of slapping a melange of tired 60's tunes onto a soundtrack for &quot;atmosphere&quot;, with little else added that would sucessfully evoke the era of radical politics in America.

This movie depicts Hoffman's experience of many, many events, each of which deserved a movie of their own. Many Hoffman's confront us through the screen: Hoffman the Fool, Hoffman the Revolutionary, Hoffman the Fugitive, Hoffman the want-to-be father, and Hoffman the Bipolar.We see the story through a series of recollections by Hoffman's friends and family, through the eyes of a journalist. &quot;Is Hoffman paranoid,&quot; he wonders as the movie begins--a question that never quite gets answered, even though the United States Government _was_ out to get him.In this biography, we also see an ugly dissection of governmental policies. We see oppression, suppression of dissent, blatant violation of rights, and the resilience of that oppressive system. Although many of the things Hoffman fought for were achieved, we still read of protesters beaten and gassed in Seattle and Los Angeles. The police still assault those who protest for non-mainstream causes. The System has not changed, only the faces of the activists. Although we're not drafting our boys and sending them to die in tropical jungles, we're helping third world governments to defoliate their forests in a &quot;War on Drugs&quot; that regularly claims innocent lives, both at home and abroad.After the farce of the 2000 elections, what would Abbie have done?

567015,A19JYLHD94K94D,B000055WFW,Itamar Katz,"[16, 16]","`Steal This Movie' is a well-thought, well-written well-acted, well-made dramatization of the life of left-wing activist Abbie Hoffman, probably the most famous of the Chicago Seven. (The title is a play on the title of Hoffman's autobiography, `Steal This Book', though it certainly doesn't have the poignancy of that title.) `Steal This Movie' made some bold casting choices. The lead role was given to Vincent D'Onofrio: not an obvious choice, because Vincent looks very little like Abbie, which caused many die-hard history aficionados to bash the decision. However, Vincent fills the role wonderful, brilliantly, expressing all the conflicting sides of Hoffman's personality, his sense of humor, his dead seriousness, strict political consciousness, bi-polar disorder, having to live in hiding and away from his wife and son. He makes the character come alive much more than someone else could have by simply looking and talking like him. Abbie's wife Anita is played wonderfully by SNL's Janeane Garofalo, accomplished comedian but not so as a dramatic actress.Though it doesn't have that much cinematic value by its own right, `Steal This Movie' does a fantastic job of getting through both the spirit of the time and the greatness and difficulties of Hoffman's activities and his character - a great and fascinating person whose impact has long been overlooked. It's also a wonderful document of an important period that is practically ignored (relatively, of course). For those interested in the late 60s, in the hippie movements, Black Panthers and other left wing political movements of the time, and of course in Hoffman himself - it's invaluable, on top of being both touching and entertaining.

Crawford,"[0, 0]","This got me to re-think Abbie, whom I saw more as a provcateur than a politician of substance (in stark contrast to many of the activists in SDS, imho).  What I remember most about him is Steal This Book, which is the perfect form of anarchy for affluent adolescents (us) in the suburbs (see the chapter ""monkey warfare"" for a guide to some of our misdeeds).  I barely recalled that he was one of the Chicago 7.He appeared far more self-aware in this film than I would have given him credit for, and it is clear that he actually did stand for some things, such as using the tools of the media to promote democracy and get out of Vietnam.  In this fine film, you get to view his entire career, from the civil rights works he did, which I didn't know about, to his swan song as a local activist.  It is a bit glib on his manic depression and its treatment, I found, but that also rounded out his portrait without creating an idol. The acting is genuinely excellent and the evocation of the time synches with my memory of the 60s:  it was a great time to be an adolescent, I mean, what better thing to do than ditch high school as a protest?  While much of it seems so callow today, it really is the last time America was interesting politically:  as Abbie says, we stopped a war and had fun.  Of course, the 1968 Chicago convention, which my parents took me to see, was a turning point in American politics, as the middle class were disgusted by the Dems, which added to the GOP's momentum as a result of civil rights alienating the South's democratic party.  That is not really analysed in the film, but then, it is not intended as poli-sci I suppose.Warmly recommended.  It is a wonderful slice of history.",4,"pretty balanced:  he admits to arrogance and buffoonery, but inspired change",1183248000,"07 1, 2007",2007,1706,"['got', 're-think', 'Abbie', 'whom', 'saw', 'more', 'provcateur', 'politician', 'substance', 'stark', 'contrast', 'many', 'activists', 'SDS', 'imho', 'What', 'remember', 'most', 'Steal', 'Book', 'perfect', 'form', 'anarchy', 'affluent', 'adolescents', 'suburbs', 'see', 'chapter', 'monkey', 'warfare', 'guide', 'misdeeds', 'barely', 'recalled', 'was', 'one', 'Chicago', '7.He', 'appeared', 'far', 'more', 'self-aware', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'credit', 'clear', 'actually', 'did', 'stand', 'things', 'such', 'using', 'tools', 'media', 'promote', 'democracy', 'get', 'Vietnam', 'fine', 'film', 'get', 'view', 'entire', 'career', 'civil', 'rights', 'did', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'about', 'swan', 'song', 'local', 'activist', 'bit', 'glib', 'manic', 'depression', 'treatment', 'found', 'also', 'rounded', 'out', 'portrait', 'creating', 'idol', 'acting', 'genuinely', 'excellent', 'evocation', 'time', 'memory', '60s', 'was', 'great', 'time', 'be', 'adolescent', 'mean', 'what', 'better', 'thing', 'do', 'ditch', 'high', 'school', 'protest', 'much', 'so', 'callow', 'today', 'really', 'last', 'time', 'America', 'was', 'interesting', 'politically', 'Abbie', 'stopped', 'war', 'had', 'fun', 'course', '1968', 'Chicago', 'convention', 'parents', 'took', 'see', 'was', 'turning', 'point', 'American', 'politics', 'middle', 'class', 'were', 'disgusted', 'Dems', 'added', 'GOP', 'momentum', 'result', 'civil', 'rights', 'alienating', 'South', 'democratic', 'party', 'not', 'really', 'analysed', 'film', 'then', 'not', 'intended', 'poli-sci', 'suppose.Warmly', 'recommended', 'wonderful', 'slice', 'history']",N/A

It may take forever, and the activist themselves may stumble along the way but change is possible. As opposed to the 'time limited' mass media presentation of social change, this transformation is a much slower ongoing process that current generations will not neccessarily be able to see).The only thing I had a problem with was the movie presented abbie as a great understander of all social movements, when previous books admit that he did not originally comprehend the importance of the feminist and GLBT movements. Eventually realizing their importance, and the necessity of understanding sexism, Abbie (like many other lefties of his generation) had entered with his own internalized biases about what was political and what constituted valid social change.Overall, however this was a great movie and I encourage ANYBODY involved in social justice work today to pick up a copy of this release for themselves and fellow activists. The end courtroom scene is especially timeless in it's celebration of revolution/indictment of discrimination and the fundamental nature of the US society.",4,Abbie---we need you now more than ever,1052956800,"05 15, 2003",2003,1566,"['received', 'movie', 'birthday', 'present', 'having', 'read', 'previous', 'biographies', 'late', 'yippie', 'brother', 'Jack..et', 'al', 'knew', 'basic', 'chronology', 'Abbie', 'life', 'seeing', 'film', 'however', 'dramatized', 'gave', 'new', 'dimension', 'had', 'previously', 'lacked', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'books.Watching', 'film', 'Bush', 'administration', 'who', 'ignored', 'lessons', 'Vietnam', 'altogether', 'war', 'world', 'reignited', 'passions', 'very', 'burt-out', 'grad', 'student', 'may', 'take', 'forever', 'activist', 'may', 'stumble', 'way', 'change', 'possible', 'opposed', ""'time"", 'limited', 'mass', 'media', 'presentation', 'social', 'change', 'transformation', 'much', 'slower', 'ongoing', 'process', 'current', 'generations', 'will', 'not', 'neccessarily', 'be', 'able', 'see', '.The', 'only', 'thing', 'had', 'problem', 'was', 'movie', 'presented', 'abbie', 'great', 'understander', 'social', 'movements', 'when', 'previous', 'books', 'admit', 'did', 'not', 'originally', 'comprehend', 'importance', 'feminist', 'GLBT', 'movements', 'Eventually', 'realizing', 'importance', 'necessity', 'understanding', 'sexism', 'Abbie', 'many', 'other', 'lefties', 'generation', 'had', 'entered', 'own', 'internalized', 'biases', 'what', 'was', 'political', 'what', 'constituted', 'valid', 'social', 'change.Overall', 'however', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'encourage', 'ANYBODY', 'involved', 'social', 'justice', 'work', 'today', 'pick', 'up', 'copy', 'release', 'fellow', 'activists', 'end', 'courtroom', 'scene', 'especially', 'timeless', 'celebration', 'revolution/indictment', 'discrimination', 'fundamental', 'nature', 'US', 'society']",N/A
