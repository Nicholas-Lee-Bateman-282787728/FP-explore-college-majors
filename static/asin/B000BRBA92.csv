In the beginning it's unclear who's on whose team, and there were several scenes with forced suspense that didn't quite feel as tense as it was obviously planned for, but overall this movie is better than some of the latest Seagal flicks.I'd recommend it for the die-hard fans, although do not expect to see him fighting.  He breaks a hand, shoots a few people, and drives like a maniac, but other than that there is no hand-to-hand combat (that Seagal engages in.  The other actors did fight, though--if that's a consolation).  Overall, a nice movie.  Definitely not a blockbuster, but also not a one star by any means.",4,Not a disappointment for the die-hard Seagal fans,1135555200,"12 26, 2005",2005,724,"['Seagal', 'Jonathan', 'Cold', 'trying', 'stop', 'Chechen', 'terrorists', 'deploying', 'plutonium', 'bomb', 'US', 'beginning', 'unclear', 'who', 'team', 'were', 'several', 'scenes', 'forced', 'suspense', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'feel', 'as', 'tense', 'was', 'obviously', 'planned', 'overall', 'movie', 'better', 'latest', 'Seagal', 'flicks.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'see', 'fighting', 'hand', 'shoots', 'few', 'people', 'drives', 'maniac', 'other', 'hand-to-hand', 'combat', 'Seagal', 'other', 'actors', 'did', 'fight', 'though', 'consolation', 'Overall', 'nice', 'movie', 'Definitely', 'not', 'blockbuster', 'also', 'not', 'one', 'star', 'means']",Black Dawn

If not, then it is a somewhat generic action film, although still much better than any of the direct to TV movies you will find coming out on, say, the SciFi channel. As many folks have mentioned, his recent stuff has been hit or miss, but if you keep coming back to watch the next one, why are you complaining? This one had a decent, straight forward plot. Not a lot in the way of fighting sequences, but the man is 50 something years old now. You tended to know what was coming, but then you don't watch Steven Seagal for trendy plot twists. The movie's pace was good and I did not hear any dubbing of Steven's lines, a major plus compared to some of his recent stuff. Many folks will find it another plus that Steven does not play a hip, street wise, down with the homies character. Personally that never really bothered me, although it was bit harder to believe.

This time his mission is to thwart a cell of Chechen terrorists scheming to detonate a nuke in Los Angeles.  The story concept promises excitement but fails to deliver.  Maybe Mr. Seagal believes he's getting ""too old"" for martial arts movies, or maybe he's decided to redirect his genre from action to suspense.  Because, while Agent Cold is apparently not ""too old"" for his young female partner, the film is disappointingly short on action.  Specifically, the trademark Aikido fighting moves that made Seagal famous.  Cold defeats the Chechens with brainpower and firepower; not a bad thing, just not what this viewer was expecting.

Fans of his have generally accepted this, since the man has proven himself a guy of repetitious plots and characters. However, it wasn't before long I looked up from my towels to become aware of a couple of things regarding the movie: first of all, it's one of Seagal's prettiest DTV releases I've ever seen, and secondly, there's almost nothing going on in it.In a sequel to Seagal's maligned DTV-emerging flickThe Foreigner(proving that it's possible to expand the franchise of absolutely anything, no matter how bad it starts), he returns as ex-CIA mercenary Jonathan Cold, who is hired by British arms-dealers to help sell parts of a nuclear bomb to a group of Chechen terrorist-martyrs planning to blow up Los Angeles. But after plans go awry and CIA agent/former prot&eacute;g&eacute; Amanda Stuart (Tamara Davies,Scorcher) gets involved, Seagal must both flee assassination and stop the plot to destroy L.A.As said before, ""Black Dawn"" actually looks very good: award-winning lifetime cinematographer Alexander Gruszynski (Tremors) directs the movie with a decent flair for lighting and camera angles, so (with the exception of a couple of atrocious CGI-involving shots) the film manages to look like more than an $8 million production. Also in its favour is the cast, which is one of the better assemblies to be seen in a Seagal film: Tamara Davies and baddies John Pyper-Ferguson (Drive), Julian Stone (Loser), and Nicholas Davidoff play their roles convincingly, and the rest of the cast is clearly making an effort as well.I just wish that at some point, somebody had gone up to either Seagal or the director and reminded them that they were, in fact, supposed to be making an action movie. Much likeThe Patriot, ""Black Dawn"" offers little satisfaction for action-lovers. The cover of the movie is deceiving: next to no martial arts are displayed (and when the single scene does come, it features the worst-disguised body double Steven's ever had), and about two of the three gunfights featured last less than thirty seconds. A decent car chase involving a big rig is the adrenaline highlight, but without any other intriguing life-ending antics, this otherwise-pretty film feels inexcusably bare for a Seagal-starring feature. The plot lacks the intensity to qualify as a thriller and therefore, the movie is left both pretty and useless; no wonder writer Martin Wheeler has had trouble finding work.This non-action aspect slays the film as a whole: a Steven Seagal movie without action is like a hamburger without the beef pattie, and no amount of decent acting or cinematography can make up for it in the end. In this sense, ""Black Dawn"" is the most disappointing of Seagal's recent offerings, because it had so many things going for it that his other flicks didn't, but these were apparently traded for Seagal's bread-and-butter, leaving this otherwise-promising flick duly emaciated.

Seagal looks bored, the script has nothing to give Seagal a chance to deliver lines the fans want to hear, he has no fight scenes and for some reason the producers decided to insert a stunt double that looked absolutely nothing like Seagal in any way near the end for no reason I could see and made me cringe when I saw it. The stunt double is not even wearing the same coloured suit as Seagal. For Seagal fans it's worth a rental then forget about it and move on to Mercenary For Justice which sounds very promising.

Both films have kind of an eastern European, dark & shadowy espionage-quality to them and despite being fairly-well directed movies are rather slow & methodical without much action to them. However, there wasn't any obvious voice-dubbing in this flick as there was in Submerged (2005) or Attack Force (2006). But there was quite a bit of use of a stunt double and it was obvious at times though it didn't really detract from the movie too much. There was one scene in particular though that I noticed towards the end of the film where Seagal's stunt double is fighting some bad guys in a stairwell and the stunt double is wearing a light grey suit, but in the scene prior to it and following it Seagal's character is wearing a dark blue suit. That was pretty bad!Unfortunately not much Aikido showcases in this movie, other than the work by the stunt double in a couple of scenes, you don't really see Seagal do much of anything other than shootouts and car chases. More and more of his more recent films are going this direction I've noticed. Less of the martial arts and more of the shootouts and car chases - disappointing.

948655,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B000BRBA92,Sid the Elf,"[1, 3]","Black Dawn was made in 2005. For those of Sid's readers who are not Segal historians, this was right in the middle of his one foot off the cliff stage in his career. Meaning, he was on a self-destructive path that miraculously ended in Segal becoming the king of straight to DVD action rather than killing himself. The movies he did during this period were attrocious at best. He must have realized how horrific he looked on camera at this point because it was here that he started producing as well as staring in these flicks. Thankfully, Segal threw in the towel on looking presentable in his films, gained an extra 50 pounds(for a total gain of 195 sinceOut for Justice), grew out the Myers hair more, and gave us a classic inPistol Whippedhopefully with more to come.The tagline for Black Dawn is ""It's always darkest before dawn."" Sid's theory on this is that it had nothing to do with the movie. No, it must have symbolized a sad night when Segal arrived at his local Wendy's just after it closed. He probably got a Santa-like far away look in his eyes and contimplated life, arriving at the conclusion that he couldn't get his usual 80 nuggets and life just isnt fair. If Sid was forced to come up with a tagline for Black Dawn, it would either be ""Steven Segal or the former Duran Duran rodie: Which guy's got it?"" or maybe ""Don't waste your time."" This film was awful, and that's saying something considering Sid's love for Segal.The movie started out well enough. Segal plays Jonathan Cold(awesome name) again. Aparently, this is a character from another Segal masterpiece. It had Segal as a rouge ex-CIA agent like he always is now in his movies. Except, after that it kind of got blurry. Sid remenbers a few former Duran Duran rodies, or maybe they were former Depeche Mode rodies. Either way. And there was an appearance by McGyver's Richard Dean Anderson's brother Richard Dean Anderson. There was also a terrible scene when Segal and the B Nicole Kidman were driving. It looked just like when people drove in movies in the 50's. You know, there was an obvious seperation between the background and the actors. Does this mean that there have been no technological advances in movies in 50 plus years? No, sadly it just means that 90% of the film's budget was wasted on Segal's dressing room Arby's spread, his robes, and massage oils. And believe us, the film suffered. What about the part at the end when Segal was throwing the Depeche Mode rodies' bomb into the water? It looked like plastic. The effects in this movie just could not have been worse. It even got to the point where Sid got tired of making of Segal. Well, except for his awful suit. It was an old-school brown pinstripe 56 long and portly at the same time with a crappy off-white shirt and an even crappier yellow tie. And it looked worse than it sounds. It was designed by the famous Burlington designer Knights of the Round Table. And it was topped off by a pair of Honchos. That was wonderful, the highlight of the movie.Well, you know a movie is terrible when the highlight was Segal's $45 ensamble. It was that rare kind of film that was only 90 minutes long but it seemed to last forever. That's not a good thing. Segal, of course, has since made a major resurgence. But, this film might have been Segal's worst effort. He had only the begining stages of his now famous Myers hair and panda bear face. And he didn't even talk like he was an aging dude from the hood. You still couldn't understand what he was saying, but there wasn't a hint of ghetto slang. Very disappointing. In fact, in keeping the old Sid tradition, let's give this one a new title.

Seagal breaks one wrist, but doesn't do much actual hand to hand combat.  Those days are probably gone.  For Seagal's fights, some funky editing is used at times, to give the appearance of battle, or perhaps it is ballet?
