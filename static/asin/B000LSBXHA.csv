1040584,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000LSBXHA,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[16, 17]","Instructor Debbie Rocker leads this walking working which adds light weights for some additional toning benefits.  She is joined by 2 background exercisers, one of whom shows lower impact modifications, in a beautiful mountain setting. There are two workouts on this DVD:  the main workout (labelled as 60 minutes but actually significantly longer at 68 minutes) and a 30-minute, shortened version of this.  Also included is a 57-minute CD designed for walking outdoors.Debbie begins the main workout with a just under 6-minute warm-up that is mostly marching, although she adds some breathing work and arm movements.  This flows into a 4.5-minute basic cardio segment that is more of an extended aerobic warm-up.  The following 10-minute cardio segment starts to bring up the intensity a little, adding moves such as cross-country arms.  Another 7.5-minute cardio segment follows, this time adding a little impact with shuffles (a light side-to-side jog) as well as some upper body movements.  Then Debbie picks up light weights (1-5 lbs.) to lead you into the first toning segment.  Here she continues to do a lot of marching, but the aerobic pace slows as you move into basic strength moves such as squats, deadlifts, lat rows, and bicep curls.Another 10-minute cardio segment follows.  This time, there is a little less marching and a bit more varied moves such as breast stroke arms and hamstring curls.  The final 7-minute cardio segment was probably the most intense, as Debbie includes more high-impact moves such as jumping jacks plus adds a bit of fun with some front punches.  Then there is a final 8-minute weights segment with additional marches, lunges, and triceps work.  The workout includes with a 3.5-minute cool-down/stretch.  The shorter, 30-minute workout (actually 33.5 minutes) uses the warm-up, the first cardio segment, the first weighted segment, the final cardio segment, and the cool-down.Overall, I was a bit disappointed in this workout, mainly because I found it hard to keep my heart rate up.  For the most part, the cardio segments are not very intense, and my heart rate dropped even further during the toning segments.  I also found Debbie's cueing to be really lacking here:  not only does she fail to mirror-cue, but also she often cues a new move way ahead of time but fails to cue actually ON the new move.  Finally, I didn't find the included CD very motivating, however--it is simply Debbie talking, occasionally encouraging you to pick up the pace as the tempo changes, but that's it. Debbie talks throughout the DVD workout as well, which some may find annoying.  If you have liked Debbie's past workouts and/or enjoy combining low-intensity cardio with very light weight work, you might like this workout, but otherwise, I think there are better options available.",3,Basic walking workout with some light toning intervals added,1204156800,"02 28, 2008",2008,2808,"['Instructor', 'Debbie', 'Rocker', 'walking', 'working', 'light', 'weights', 'additional', 'toning', 'benefits', 'joined', '2', 'background', 'exercisers', 'one', 'whom', 'shows', 'lower', 'impact', 'modifications', 'beautiful', 'mountain', 'setting', 'are', 'two', 'workouts', 'DVD', 'main', 'workout', 'labelled', '60', 'minutes', 'actually', 'significantly', 'longer', '68', 'minutes', '30-minute', 'shortened', 'version', 'Also', 'included', '57-minute', 'CD', 'designed', 'walking', 'outdoors.Debbie', 'main', 'workout', 'just', '6-minute', 'warm-up', 'mostly', 'marching', 'breathing', 'work', 'arm', 'movements', '4.5-minute', 'basic', 'cardio', 'segment', 'more', 'extended', 'aerobic', 'warm-up', 'following', '10-minute', 'cardio', 'segment', 'bring', 'up', 'intensity', 'little', 'adding', 'moves', 'such', 'cross-country', 'arms', '7.5-minute', 'cardio', 'segment', 'time', 'adding', 'little', 'impact', 'shuffles', 'light', 'side-to-side', 'jog', 'as', 'well', 'upper', 'body', 'movements', 'Then', 'Debbie', 'up', 'light', 'weights', '1-5', 'lbs', 'lead', 'first', 'toning', 'segment', 'Here', 'do', 'lot', 'marching', 'aerobic', 'pace', 'move', 'basic', 'strength', 'moves', 'such', 'squats', 'deadlifts', 'lat', 'rows', 'bicep', 'curls.Another', '10-minute', 'cardio', 'segment', 'time', 'little', 'less', 'marching', 'bit', 'more', 'varied', 'moves', 'such', 'breast', 'stroke', 'arms', 'hamstring', 'curls', 'final', '7-minute', 'cardio', 'segment', 'was', 'probably', 'most', 'intense', 'Debbie', 'more', 'high-impact', 'moves', 'such', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'bit', 'fun', 'front', 'punches', 'Then', 'final', '8-minute', 'weights', 'segment', 'additional', 'marches', 'lunges', 'triceps', 'work', 'workout', '3.5-minute', 'cool-down/stretch', 'shorter', '30-minute', 'workout', 'actually', '33.5', 'minutes', 'warm-up', 'first', 'cardio', 'segment', 'first', 'weighted', 'segment', 'final', 'cardio', 'segment', 'cool-down.Overall', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'workout', 'mainly', 'found', 'hard', 'keep', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'most', 'part', 'cardio', 'segments', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'intense', 'heart', 'rate', 'dropped', 'even', 'further', 'toning', 'segments', 'also', 'found', 'Debbie', 'cueing', 'be', 'really', 'lacking', 'here', 'not', 'only', 'fail', 'mirror-cue', 'also', 'often', 'new', 'move', 'way', 'ahead', 'time', 'fails', 'cue', 'actually', 'ON', 'new', 'move', 'Finally', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'included', 'CD', 'very', 'motivating', 'however', 'simply', 'Debbie', 'talking', 'occasionally', 'encouraging', 'pick', 'up', 'pace', 'tempo', 'changes', 'Debbie', 'talks', 'DVD', 'workout', 'as', 'well', 'may', 'find', 'annoying', 'have', 'liked', 'Debbie', 'past', 'workouts', 'and/or', 'enjoy', 'combining', 'low-intensity', 'cardio', 'very', 'light', 'weight', 'work', 'might', 'like', 'workout', 'otherwise', 'think', 'are', 'better', 'options', 'available']","Walk, Sculpt and Tone with Debbie Rocker"
1040585,A1X4AI4AZOVMAM,B000LSBXHA,Betty A. Ludwig,"[3, 4]","This is a pretty good workout. My biggest complaint is that after you finish a segment, you get to do the exact same segment all over again. I would love this DVD if she would have mixed the segments instead of making you go through the exact same one again. I thought the toning/sculpting segments were excellent. The full workout gets long at times because she doesn't mix it up enough with the segments. With that being said, you do get a decent workout and the toning segments are well worth it.",4,a decent workout but...,1206144000,"03 22, 2008",2008,499,"['pretty', 'good', 'workout', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'finish', 'segment', 'get', 'do', 'exact', 'same', 'segment', 'over', 'again', 'would', 'love', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'mixed', 'segments', 'instead', 'making', 'go', 'exact', 'same', 'one', 'again', 'thought', 'toning/sculpting', 'segments', 'were', 'excellent', 'full', 'workout', 'long', 'times', ""n't"", 'mix', 'up', 'enough', 'segments', 'being', 'said', 'do', 'get', 'decent', 'workout', 'toning', 'segments', 'are', 'well']","Walk, Sculpt and Tone with Debbie Rocker"

By the end I was sweating like crazy.  If you really concentrate on the moves and do them properly you will get an amazing calorie burn.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 b/c of the light weights in the sculpting segments.  I would have liked to use 5 lbs instead of 3, but the fast movements made that impossible.Debbie's cuing is a little ""off"", but that's OK.

1040589,A3BI52QUZP9O8,B000LSBXHA,lovestodive,"[0, 0]","I have another workout by Debbie Rocker and had watched a clip from this one so I must admit, I knew what I was getting into.  Her cueing is not the best, she tends to ramble on and on and her form is not the best. One of the background exercisers was Stephanie Vitorino, an instructor herself, and she did a good job so I watched her instead.  This is a walking workout, however, and as such it does a decent job.  It should be noted, it is mostly a marching workout with a small amount of strength mixed in.  The strength portion was a bit weak, usually when doing strength with walking I'll use a lighter weight so that is what I did but she actually stops most of the time instead of walking so heavier weights would have been a better bet.  The workout is filmed in the dessert with all three women walking (marching) on some sort of rocky surface.  I found this distracting, I kept expecting one of them to step on a rock and hurt themselves.  When it was time to transition from one segment to the next, i.e. slower to faster, walking to strength, etc., the camera would pan to the background mountains then back to the walkers.  This made it difficult to know if you were supposed to continue what you were doing or change to something else. There is the full length 60 min. work out and a 30 min. mini workout as well.  I'm assuming the 30 min. one is just the 60 mins squashed down but I have not done it yet.  If I do, I plan on using heavier weights.All in all, this is not my favorite walking workout but it did get the heart rate up a bit and will stay in my rotation, thankfully I have over 200 workout DVDs so it won't pop up any time soon.",3,The actual exercise portion is o.k.,1394928000,"03 16, 2014",2014,1656,"['have', 'workout', 'Debbie', 'Rocker', 'had', 'watched', 'clip', 'one', 'so', 'must', 'admit', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'getting', 'cueing', 'not', 'best', 'ramble', 'form', 'not', 'best', 'One', 'background', 'exercisers', 'was', 'Stephanie', 'Vitorino', 'instructor', 'herself', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'watched', 'instead', 'walking', 'workout', 'however', 'such', 'decent', 'job', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'mostly', 'marching', 'workout', 'small', 'amount', 'strength', 'mixed', 'strength', 'portion', 'was', 'bit', 'weak', 'usually', 'when', 'doing', 'strength', 'walking', ""'ll"", 'use', 'lighter', 'weight', 'what', 'did', 'actually', 'most', 'time', 'instead', 'walking', 'so', 'heavier', 'weights', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'bet', 'workout', 'filmed', 'dessert', 'three', 'women', 'walking', 'marching', 'sort', 'rocky', 'surface', 'found', 'distracting', 'kept', 'expecting', 'one', 'step', 'rock', 'hurt', 'When', 'was', 'time', 'transition', 'one', 'segment', 'next', 'i.e', 'slower', 'faster', 'walking', 'strength', 'etc.', 'camera', 'would', 'pan', 'background', 'then', 'back', 'walkers', 'made', 'difficult', 'know', 'were', 'supposed', 'continue', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'change', 'something', 'else', 'full', 'length', '60', 'min', 'work', 'out', '30', 'min', 'mini', 'workout', 'as', 'well', ""'m"", 'assuming', '30', 'min', 'one', 'just', '60', 'mins', 'squashed', 'down', 'have', 'not', 'done', 'yet', 'do', 'plan', 'using', 'heavier', 'weights.All', 'not', 'favorite', 'walking', 'workout', 'did', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'bit', 'will', 'stay', 'rotation', 'thankfully', 'have', 'over', '200', 'workout', 'DVDs', 'wo', ""n't"", 'pop', 'up', 'time', 'soon']","Walk, Sculpt and Tone with Debbie Rocker"
