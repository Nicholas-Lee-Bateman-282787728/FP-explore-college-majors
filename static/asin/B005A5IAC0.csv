1452044,A26S6MNOJ27EBE,B005A5IAC0,Alicja Z.,"[20, 27]","*WARNNG: CONATINS SPOILERS*The name of the show, Trchwood, stands for the Torchwood Institute. It is a spin-of from Doctor Who. The Torchwood institute was established in 1879 by Queen Victoria after the events of ""Tooth and Claw"". Its prime directive is to defend the earth against extraterrestrial threats.This season not only horribly deviates from the classic Torchwood alien of the week episode style but the name Torchwood itself seems to have no meaning anymore. The Hub is gone and the ""team"" (Gwen and Jack really) are in America now. There is nothing anymore that relates it to the Torchwood institute or (SPOILER) *gasp* aliens. That is right, Torchwood established to protect the Earth from aliens has a 10 episode season where there are NO aliens. And a bare mention of alien technology.That doesn't even start to cover all the plot holes and 'verse continuity errors. The biggest being that Jack lived on Earth for over 100 years waiting for the Doctor to explain why he was immortal. He finally saw the Doctor in a Doctor Who crossover episode after Series 1 (aka 21st century) in his personal timeline. Yes, back in early 20th Century, he tells his then lover informaton that he doesn't find out until 80 years nto the future of his personal timeline. If he knows all that, why is he waiting for the Doctor to tell him that? It was an embaressing omission to the writers.Some of the new characters, like Esther, are very likable. She develops through the show and grows. While other new characters, like Rex, are just homophobic alpha males with no depth.The ending, I won't spoil it, makes no sense. If the ending made sense, than Jack's kids would have also... Yup! Lots of implications for that one... And if there is a field that could make Jack mortal, why hadn't the Doctor thought of it and fixed Jack when Jack asked to be fixed? They make them protable, as we scene in the scene with his old ex-lover...If Jack's immortality was so wrong that the Doctor abandoned him then would the entire planet's immortality panic the Doctor that something was really wrong. Unless, Jack's immortality is different than that of the people and so it shouldn't effect Jack at all.Gwen betrays Jack for her family begging for his understanding. She says that she'd do anything to save her daughter. At teh same time, Jack sacrificed his grandson in CoE (Children of Earth) to save the planet and his own daughted hated him for it. And this was a day after he lost Ianto Jones. How easily Gwen forgets Jack's sacrifices. It was panful to watch her shatter an already broken man who she claims to love.The explanation for why there is a giant hole through the center of the Earth and is not filled with magma is glossed over and weak. It also does not conform to the Dcotor Who universe where an alien spaceship is supposingly at the center of the planet.In one of the eps, there's a line about a Federal agency, the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms), trying to get permission from the CIA to look inside a pharmaceutical company's warehouse. The CIA doesn't have that authority since teh CIA does not have the authority to act inside the US (they probably would have been asking the FBI or have their own authority.Oswald would have never been released so quickly from prison, it would have taken years in appeals and probably a hearing by the US Supreme Court. And I just couldn't understand the point in having him there at all.Honestly, MD could be any American story on TV without the Torchwood name or even Jack and Gwen and still stand like it is. It resembles nothing like Torchwood was, even with CoE. It lack the charm of taking place in Cardiff, the aliens, and dry British wit it was famous for.",1,Torchwood?

1452061,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B005A5IAC0,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[4, 7]","On one perfectly normal day, everyone in the world stops dying. Governments scramble to find an explanation as, with every passing day, the population of the world grows larger, overwhelming limited resources. Also, whilst people are immortal, they still feel pain, and still need food so as not to live in a permanent state of starvation. Wounds don't heal properly, so the demand for painkillers goes through the roof. Society begins to crumble, and finding - and reversing - the 'Miracle' becomes the top priority for CIA Agent Rex Matheson. His only clue is one word: 'Torchwood'.Torchwood: Miracle Day is, effectively, the fourth season of the Doctor Who spin-off show and also a self-contained ten-episode mini-series in its own right. A co-production between the BBC and American cable network Starz, the series is meant to be accessible to a new audience, but includes some continuity references to earlier episodes for established fans. Given the success of the previous mini-series, Children of Earth, in 2009, it's fair to say that a lot of people were looking forward to Miracle Day with some enthusiasm.In the event, Miracle Day can best be described as 'stark raving bonkers'. The series has a vein of incoherent insanity raging through it that would shame even the last two seasons of True Blood. Working out what is going on at any given moment is a difficult task, as the series seems rather vague on who the bad guys are and who's working for whom and who's double-crossing whom and what their ultimate goals are. Our characters seem in a permanent state of being betrayed, arrested, deported or rescued by people who may be enemies, or potential allies, or allies who have become enemies through misunderstandings. Compared to the tightly-plotted Children of Earth (but unfortunately more in keeping with much of Russell T. Davies' other work), Miracle Day's story-telling is so diffuse and vague it might as well be vapour.On the plus side, the series features a pretty good cast. Mekhi Phifer is entertainingly gruff as Matheson, but shines in more dramatic scenes as well. Alexa Havins provides the show with a solid emotional core as Esther Drummond, whose family is caught up in the Miracle crisis in a painful way. John Barrowman and Eva Myles are as solid as ever as Captain Jack and Gwen Cooper, though they are sidelined in earlier episodes in favour of the newcomers. They come back strong by mid-season and there are some good scenes in which their character relationships and motivations are very strongly defined (or redefined). This Torchwood team is likable and entertaining, which is vital. Bill Pullman also does solid work as Oswald Danes, the murderer condemned to death row who escapes his fate thanks to the Miracle. His character arc eventually ends up getting confused, goes nowhere for most of the season and then ends in cliche, but Pullman does the best he can with the material he's given. Arlene Tur is very impressive as Dr. Juraez, who provides an important POV on the medical ramifications of the crisis in its early stages. Lauren Ambrose is also excellent as the PR woman from hell, Jilly Kitzinger, though she is under-used until the last couple of episodes.Later on, we get guest turns from Star Trek alumni Nana Visitor and John de Lancie, though unfortunately both roles are under-written and under-developed. More impressive is Daniele Favilli, who only gets one episode as Angelo (a former lover of Captain Jack who appears in flashback) but makes the most out of a small role.The show has some serious cash behind it, which is best-seen in an epic helicopter battle in the first episode. Unfortunately, this generous budget appears to have been stretched thin by the final episode, which features some painfully obvious re-use of the same sets and some frankly atrocious bluescreen work for this day and age. The less said about the 'crack in the world' CGI effect, the better.One of the most enticing prospects behind the series was that, as an American production, they'd be able to hire a decent composer. However, I can only conclude that Murray Gold has some serious dirt on Russell T. Davies. It's the only explanation for why he keeps hiring him despite Gold's total lack of talent. His music, utterly terrible since the very first episode the new Doctor Who six years ago, is at its most bombastic, tonally inappropriate and grating here.The strengths are good enough to keep watching, but the weaknesses are damning. Even more annoying is the fact that just as the problems become apparently insurmountable and the resolve to keep watching wanes, the show will suddenly throw you a curve-ball of unexpected quality. Jack and Gwen's characters develop quite nicely throughout the season, and a flashback episode to Jack's past in New York City and his relationship with Angelo is mostly successful. Perhaps a tad overwrought, but it's a highlight of the season (which bafflingly, goes on to play little to no role in the overall storyline of the season). It's also good to see that Davies hasn't forgotten that victories should be messy and earned painfully, with few characters left standing at the end of the season. However, bafflingly, the series ends on a series of cliffhangers which lead to the conclusion that there will be more Torchwood to come (though the storyline of the Miracle itself is resolved). Yet Davies has said he wants to move on and explore other projects and Starz have said they will only co-fund future series with Davies' involvement. So the open-ended nature of the series is somewhat baffling.Torchwood: Miracle Day (***) is a massive let-down after the excellent Children of Earth, though quite a few elements do work. The initial exploration of the central premise is well-handled, most of the cast (particularly the two new members of Torchwood) are great and the show handles its new trans-Atlantic format successfully. However, the writing is inconsistent, the production values collapse in the last two episodes to sub-Sarah Jane Adventures levels for no discernible reason and the series is left confusingly open-ended given there may be no more episodes in future. It's watchable and entertaining but, as the series goes on, increasingly only in a wide-eyed, what-the-hell-can-they-possibly-do-now kind of way. The series will be released on DVD and Blu-Ray in the UK on 14 November 2011.

They sustain massive injuries, get blown up, stabbed, burned, what have you, but yet they live and live and live without the great surcease of pain. For some this would be a blessing; time granted to them while surgeons repair damaged bodies. To others it would be a living hell no one should ever endure.This is the situation the world finds itself in at the start of ""The New World,"" the first episode of Torchwood: Miracle Day. It's the fourth series to of the Doctor Who spinoff be produced and the first to be co-produced with the American television network Starz.As the story opens, we find a man, Oswald Dane (Bill Pullman), about to be executed for the rape and murder of a twelve-year-old girl. His defense? ""She should have run faster."" Not the most sympathetic character. We watch as his execution begins and then starts to go horribly wrong when, in a scene that went on almost long enough to become funny, he starts screaming in agony and breaking loose from his restraints.He's not the only person to survive apparent death. CIA agent Rex Matheson (Mekhi Phifer), is driving while being told that the word ""TORCHWOOD"" is appearing on screens all over the CIA, only to disappear as quickly. As he's processing this, and indulging in some job hunting, some rebar falls from a truck in front of him and does, oh, some very nasty things. He's brought to the hospital where, to everyone's surprise including his own, he lives.Soon word of undying people spreads around the globe and everyone begins looking for answers. Matheson's friend, fellow CIA agent Esther Drummond (Alexis Havins), thinks there may be a connection with Torchwood. She raids the CIA archive, finds a photo of Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman), and then is confronted by the man himself, who saves her from an explosion and then is troubled to notice that a scratch on his arm isn't healing.Matheson himself soon leaves the hospital and begins investigating the case, eventually traveling to Wales where he complains a lot and tracks down Gwen Cooper, who has been leaving peacefully with her husband Rhys and baby Anwen. Rhys is less than pleased to have anyone snooping around trying to get his wife involved. Cooper on the other hand seems to have become bored with domestic life and is quite keen to return to the fight; a fight that becomes all too literal as assassins try to kill everyone.The show is off to a great start. All the characters we know and love from the British series (well, those still alive at any rate), return and are put to good use, though the show is nearly stolen away from them by exceptional performances from Mekhi Phifer and Bill Pullman. The central problem of a never-dying population is also handled with intelligence and logic, including a couple conversations about why, exactly, this is a problem.The program is also doing an excellent job of building off the darker, more adult feel the series gained with 2009's Children of Earth, but isn't nearly as buried in dread. Fans of that series will also be pleased to know that it hasn't been forgotten and that numerous references to the 456 turn up throughout the first episode.While it is hard to evaluate the entire series on the strength of this first episode, I will say that it seems to be off to a great start. At no point was I bored or disinterested in what was happening, and I am very much looking forward to what happens next. Producer Russell T Davies has created an exceptionally fascinating conumdrum and watching how he gets everyone out of it promises to be vastly entertaining.GRADE: 4 stars out of 4.Returning to the series are stars John Barrowman as Captain Jack Harkness, Eve Myles as Gwen Cooper, supporting actors Kai Owen and Tom Price, as well as Russell T Davies and some of the rest of the production staff. Joining the cast are Mekhi Phifer, Bill Pullman and Alexis Havins.

1452107,AYG1U47VFZ165,B005A5IAC0,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[3, 4]","I'll have to confess to missing most of the TORCHWOOD phenomenon.  Oh, I'm experienced enough in the world of DOCTOR WHO to know that Russell T. Davies conceived of it there, spun it off from there, and I know it had two seasons and a mini (""Children of Earth"") before it was rescued from relative obscurity by the STARZ (Entertainment) Network stateside and given a new lease on domestic life.  One could make the argument that that's the perfect destination for Davies' all-too-thoughtful rumination on all thing supernatural with a cosmic angle, even though this first (and only?) season produced mixed results at best.Oswald Danes (played by Bill Pullman) is a convicted child killer who - due to circumstances beyond explanation - survives his execution.  Suddenly, the truth is an even greater revelation: worldwide, no one is dying!  Simply, people keep on living, despite illness or infirmary, and planet Earth is experiencing a population boom like never imagined.  Enter CIA agent Rex Matheson (Mekhi Phifer).  He believes these recent developments maybe be tied to an ultra-secret British organization known only as ""Torchwood.""  Matheson locates Torchwood regulars, Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) and Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles); whisks them off to the United States; and attempts to unmask the puppetmasters behind the conspiracy while the fate of Earth hangs in the balance.It's a noble premise with all of the sci-fi trappings common to the works of Mr. Davies.  In fact, the new stateside setting might've been ""just what the Doctor ordered"" (pun intended) to bring new life to the Torchwood happenings.  With a focus on action and more than a healthy investigation of Captain Jack's curious `sexuality,' TORCHWOOD: MIRACLE DAY would almost seem to be tailor-made for American cable.Almost ...There's an interesting puzzle at the heart of MIRACLE DAY, and that's this: how is it that on any given day an immortal could be turned `mortal' whilst the lowly mortals are suddenly blessed with life everlasting?  The show works best when it peels back the layers associated to this central mystery.  It does so early on in these ten episodes, and it refocuses in the final installments, but, in between, there's an awful lot of gobbledygook that could've easily been trimmed.  After being relocated to the United States, there's barely the bat of an eyelash, and Gwen Cooper is summoned back to the England to deal with personal developments; sure, they're related to the events of the Miracle, but quite a bit of them unfold way too conveniently and way too circumstantially to believe that they were a necessary component of the greater story here.  Also, there are a handful of side characters introduced here - additional CIA officers and agents, a pharmaceutical company with its representatives - that, as much as Davies and the other writers try to establish their importance, they're just not given enough substance for the audience to authentically care about them.  As a result, they're reduced to stock characters you either love or hate, depending upon the needs of the plot.Also - and I very rarely harp on actors - could they find no other established commodity than Bill Pullman to play, of all things, a child killer?  Along with fresh-faced Lauren Ambrose as a pharmaceutical rep, he's horrifically miscast here, seeming more like a disillusioned kindly uncle than a murderous villain who becomes the new AntiChrist.  Sadly, as characters they essentially keep hitting the same `notes' - commerce is bad, televangelism is bad, corporations are bad, government is bad - so neither addition, while significant to the story, appear legitimate.  Because of that and the fact that the secondary events seem passable, much of MIRACLE DAY mires down with excess.  I've no doubt some trimming and tighter focus would've made this a vastly more successful program.  It started strong, it struggled in the middle, and it never faithfully regained its legs in its finale, perhaps leaving more threads dangling than it should have.But ... let me be perfectly clear on this point: the first episode here - ""The New World"" - is stellar on absolutely every level.  Viewing it, I can say that I'd honestly expected the entirety of MIRACLE DAY to be a much different series, one with much more action and intensity, than what is inevitably delivered.  Is that a bad thing?  Certainly not.  The strength of this introduction encourages every viewer to hang around for things to come; however, the end result with the inevitable climax was far more meditative and reflective for its own good.TORCHWOOD: MIRACLE DAY was produced by BBC Worldwide for BBC Cymru Wales, BBC Worldwide, and Starz Entertainment.  DVD distribution is being handled by Warner Home Video, Inc.  It looks and sounds splendid, as any television production could.  The release is chocked full of extras including audio commentary, character profiles (definitely helpful for newbies to the franchise), an obligatory feature of the special effects of the series, some deleted scenes, and a ""Web of Lies"" motion comic.  It's a great package for anyone hoping to explore the program from behind-the-scenes, though I doubt you'll find anything particularly Earth-shattering here.RECOMMENDED.  It ain't perfect, but, as television fair, TORCHWOOD: MIRACLE DAY hits a lot of solid moments, though I'm not sure it'll win any converts to the whole DOCTOR WHO/TORCHWOOD franchise.  A bit overlong and overwrought at times, MIRACLE DAY could've been trimmed from a bloated ten episodes down to, maybe, six or seven, and there still would've been plenty of meat to deliver a terrific meal.  As it stands, it feels a few hours overcooked - with a few unnecessary sides - and delivers less nuance than any good drama should.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the good folks at BBC America provided me with a DVD screener of TORCHWOOD: MIRACLE DAY for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",3,MIRACLE DAY Miraculously Misses The Mark,1348617600,"09 26,

1452141,A3KKN529MSGYA9,B005A5IAC0,"Jim Sommers ""J.S.""","[1, 2]","I didn't watch any of the TV episodes of Miracle Day and avoided reading anything with spoilers. As soon as the Region 1 DVD was announced I ordered it and waited - and waited and waited and waited some more. I couldn't help thinking there was some kind of conspiracy to kill off the show, wondering why we couldn't watch it on iTunes or any similar service even long after it had finished its run. At the same time I was thinking that Americanizing these British offerings always seems to work against them. Going after the larger U.S. market, most of which doesn't have an appetite for British humor, via a network like Starz, means lots of sacrifices have to be made. Also, having read that Russell Davies put much of the writing in the hands of U.S. writers really gave me the feeling that this surely would be Torchwood's swan song. So, by the time the delivery from Amazon arrived I think I already might have hated it.I watched the whole series over the course of a week and, contrary to what had been going on in my head, enjoyed it. I also have to admit that I agree with quite a bit of the negative criticism that has been written in this forum. So my answer to that reasonable question ""So why did you like it?"" is: I don't know.The British Humor, that I've always loved, is almost totally absent. I felt that one of the early episodes (can't remember if it's 2 or 3) gets seriously bogged down and I agree with the writer who complained that Jack was underutilized. I felt the 2 American CIA agents - Rex & Esther - were weak links. Both ""required characters"" for today's market I guess: The fast-typing computer hacker who can quickly figure out how to get into the most secure locations and the crafty, everything-wise, good-looking hulk who operates is his own world. On the other hand the two ""caricatures,"" Oswald Danes and Jilly Kitzinger more than make up for the CIA pair's blandness. Both Bill Pullman and Lauren Ambrose manage to deliver an odd kind of humor even while we were busy despising them.More than one person remarked on how seasons 1 & 2 were their favorites. And I find myself agreeing with that also. Perhaps it has something to do with us (viewers) being expected to get into fantasy land, suspending all kinds of realities, for too long a time at once. It's probably a lot easier to suspend sanity for a shorter - one, or at the most two-part - adventure. Or am I being too kind & should we let Russell Davies have it for either 1: picking the wrong writers, 2: Not keeping a closer eye on those that he did choose or 3: Not writing the whole thing himself? Maybe that would have been more logical since wasn't it he who dreamed up the whole thing?Still, after all the warts and illogical transitions from one episode to the next it still was a fun ride. I hope the series has a future. Though maybe it would be brighter if they returned to Cardiff and stayed away from L.A.",4,Don't know why . . .,1335657600,"04 29, 2012",2012,2911,"['did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'TV', 'episodes', 'Miracle', 'Day', 'avoided', 'reading', 'anything', 'spoilers', 'As', 'soon', 'Region', '1', 'DVD', 'was', 'announced', 'ordered', 'waited', 'waited', 'waited', 'waited', 'more', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'was', 'kind', 'conspiracy', 'kill', 'off', 'show', 'wondering', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'watch', 'iTunes', 'similar', 'service', 'even', 'long', 'had', 'finished', 'run', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'thinking', 'Americanizing', 'British', 'offerings', 'always', 'work', 'Going', 'larger', 'U.S.', 'market', 'most', ""n't"", 'have', 'appetite', 'British', 'humor', 'network', 'Starz', 'lots', 'sacrifices', 'have', 'be', 'made', 'Also', 'having', 'read', 'Russell', 'Davies', 'put', 'much', 'writing', 'hands', 'U.S.', 'writers', 'really', 'gave', 'feeling', 'surely', 'would', 'be', 'Torchwood', 'swan', 'song', 'So', 'time', 'delivery', 'Amazon', 'arrived', 'think', 'already', 'might', 'have', 'hated', 'it.I', 'watched', 'whole', 'series', 'course', 'week', 'contrary', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'going', 'head', 'enjoyed', 'also', 'have', 'admit', 'agree', 'bit', 'negative', 'criticism', 'been', 'written', 'forum', 'answer', 'reasonable', 'question', 'So', 'why', 'did', 'do', ""n't"", 'know.The', 'British', 'Humor', ""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'almost', 'totally', 'absent', 'felt', 'one', 'early', 'episodes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', '2', '3', 'seriously', 'bogged', 'down', 'agree', 'writer', 'who', 'complained', 'Jack', 'was', 'underutilized', 'felt', '2', 'American', 'CIA', 'agents', 'Rex', 'Esther', 'were', 'weak', 'links', 'required', 'characters', 'today', 'market', 'guess', 'fast-typing', 'computer', 'hacker', 'who', 'can', 'quickly', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'get', 'most', 'secure', 'locations', 'crafty', 'everything-wise', 'good-looking', 'hulk', 'who', 'own', 'world', 'other', 'hand', 'two', 'caricatures', 'Oswald', 'Danes', 'Jilly', 'Kitzinger', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'CIA', 'pair', 'blandness', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'Lauren', 'Ambrose', 'manage', 'deliver', 'odd', 'kind', 'humor', 'even', 'were', 'busy', 'despising', 'them.More', 'one', 'person', 'remarked', 'how', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'were', 'favorites', 'find', 'agreeing', 'also', 'Perhaps', 'something', 'do', 'viewers', 'being', 'expected', 'get', 'fantasy', 'land', 'suspending', 'kinds', 'realities', 'too', 'long', 'time', 'once', 'probably', 'lot', 'easier', 'suspend', 'sanity', 'shorter', 'one', 'most', 'two-part', 'adventure', 'am', 'being', 'too', 'kind', 'should', 'let', 'Russell', 'Davies', 'have', '1', 'picking', 'wrong', 'writers', '2', 'Not', 'keeping', 'closer', 'eye', 'did', 'choose', '3', 'Not', 'writing', 'whole', 'thing', 'Maybe', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'logical', 'was', ""n't"", 'who', 'dreamed', 'up', 'whole', 'thing', 'Still', 'warts', 'illogical', 'transitions', 'one', 'episode', 'next', 'still', 'was', 'fun', 'ride', 'hope', 'series', 'future', 'maybe', 'would', 'be', 'brighter', 'returned', 'Cardiff', 'stayed', 'away', 'L.A']",Torchwood Miracle Day anglais

While the morals are very clear and the heroes are all properly outraged, the plot is just too depressing for me, and it makes the previous ""Torchwood"" seasons downright chipper by comparison.Don't get me wrong here. John Barrowman, Eve Myles, and Kai Owen are up to their normal acting standards and their on-screen time is still a joy. Their characters are as feisty, hilarious, and hearty as ever, and they get 5 stars from me. I just wish there was more TIME focused on them!! They almost felt like supporting guest stars rather than crucial central components of the story. This would not be a problem if the new characters were stronger, but as it stands, the focus is just too split and there wasn't enough room for the new guys to develop.The pilot episode was promising (with a typical blend of action, mystery, and ""hear me roar"" Gwen) and the season's ending wraps up suitably, but much of the time in between seems undecided or like it has a split focus. The plotwork is still very dense, but it felt like there was a lot of fluff inserted in keeping with other American shows. This is where some of the original British quirk and charm fizzles (even though some of the production crew and writers are the same here as in the BBC seasons). I know there are plot reasons why there is little to no tech/gadgetry, but they could have made a joke or two about it. Instead, the very few moments of humor mainly just involve making fun of Americans. Captain Jack is supposed to be mysterious and leave questions unanswered, but everyone was so busy obsessing about his immortality/mortality that there wasn't even much room for his usual anecdotes or ominous remarks. I also kept waiting for a moment where they dealt with otherwordly creatures (an alien, a shapeshifter, even a freaking zombie!!), but none came.This season is conspiracy-heavy, which might not be so bad if it wasn't so close to a possible future (HINT: certainly things that the past saw). It looks like a spy show, not a science fiction action/adventure. The acting is fine and the script is generally strong, but something doesn't quite click. Some people jabbed the ""Children of Earth"" miniseries, but I assure you that it is solid and worth watching (and merely bittersweet instead of incessantly gloomy).This season is not for the weak-stomached and newbies should NOT grab this set for their first taste.",2,"I'm sorry, I really wanted to like this season but I just can't",1371945600,"06 23, 2013",2013,2544,"['know', 'Torchwood', 'characterized', 'part', 'uncomfortably', 'outlandish', 'plots', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'taken', 'absolute', 'limits', 'one', 'morals', 'are', 'very', 'clear', 'heroes', 'are', 'properly', 'outraged', 'plot', 'just', 'too', 'depressing', 'previous', 'Torchwood', 'seasons', 'downright', 'chipper', 'comparison.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'here', 'John', 'Barrowman', 'Eve', 'Myles', 'Kai', 'Owen', 'are', 'up', 'normal', 'acting', 'standards', 'on-screen', 'time', 'still', 'joy', 'characters', 'are', 'feisty', 'hilarious', 'hearty', 'ever', 'get', '5', 'stars', 'just', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'TIME', 'focused', 'almost', 'felt', 'supporting', 'guest', 'stars', 'rather', 'crucial', 'central', 'components', 'story', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'problem', 'new', 'characters', 'were', 'stronger', 'focus', 'just', 'too', 'split', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'room', 'new', 'guys', 'develop.The', 'pilot', 'episode', 'was', 'promising', 'typical', 'blend', 'action', 'mystery', 'hear', 'roar', 'Gwen', 'season', 'ending', 'up', 'suitably', 'much', 'time', 'undecided', 'split', 'focus', 'plotwork', 'still', 'very', 'dense', 'felt', 'was', 'lot', 'fluff', 'inserted', 'keeping', 'other', 'American', 'shows', 'where', 'original', 'British', 'quirk', 'charm', 'fizzles', 'even', 'production', 'crew', 'writers', 'are', 'same', 'here', 'BBC', 'seasons', 'know', 'are', 'plot', 'reasons', 'why', 'little', 'tech/gadgetry', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'joke', 'two', 'Instead', 'very', 'few', 'moments', 'humor', 'mainly', 'just', 'involve', 'making', 'fun', 'Americans', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'supposed', 'be', 'mysterious', 'leave', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'everyone', 'was', 'so', 'busy', 'obsessing', 'immortality/mortality', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'much', 'room', 'usual', 'anecdotes', 'ominous', 'remarks', 'also', 'kept', 'waiting', 'moment', 'where', 'dealt', 'otherwordly', 'creatures', 'alien', 'shapeshifter', 'even', 'freaking', 'zombie', 'none', 'came.This', 'season', 'conspiracy-heavy', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'close', 'possible', 'future', 'HINT', 'certainly', 'things', 'past', 'saw', 'spy', 'show', 'not', 'science', 'fiction', 'action/adventure', 'acting', 'fine', 'script', 'generally', 'strong', 'something', ""n't"", 'quite', 'click', 'people', 'jabbed', 'Children', 'Earth', 'miniseries', 'assure', 'solid', 'worth', 'watching', 'merely', 'bittersweet', 'instead', 'incessantly', 'gloomy', '.This', 'season', 'not', 'weak-stomached', 'newbies', 'should', 'NOT', 'grab', 'set', 'first', 'taste']",Torchwood Miracle Day anglais

1452158,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B005A5IAC0,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[1, 1]","I burst out laughing at the climax. That was my takeaway from watching this tentative, sprawling American relaunch of a good British series: at the supposedly affecting climax, when the twining threads of science fiction, philosophy, action-adventure, and religion come together in a moment that ought to inspire awe, my response was a gut laugh. So many convergent forces collided at once that perhaps no other response was even possible.This series has a good premise, I'll grant it that. What happens when the human race stops dying? Our society and economy assume a certain number of births and deaths every day. When the show can bother to examine this premise, it makes for good speculations on the contrast between a finite world and a potentially infinite humanity. Perhaps the Occupy Wall Street sect could use this show as propaganda.But the show runners can't decide what they want to accomplish. The ambiguous triangle between Mekhi Phieffer, Arlene Tur, and Alexa Havens; sprawling detours with Wayne Knight (in a surprising badass turn) and John DeLancie; Captain Jack's romances, past and present. I kept wanting to scream ""Pick one story and stick with it!"" I think Eve Myles did, too, because she perseveres admirably, but looks bored at several cow paths.The religious implications, which might have succeeded if treated with less aggression and self-seriousness, also get silly. Producer Russell T. Davies, former show runner for Doctor Who, previously turned the Doctor into ""the Lonely God"" on that series. Now he turns Captain Jack into His Risen Son, whose spilled blood relieves the suffering of humankind. A little of this was fine, even insightful at first, but it escalates into unintentional comedy.Entire episodes could have been chopped from this season without hurting the narrative arc. Perhaps they should have been. A friend of mine described ""Children of Earth"" as ""like being beaten on for five straight hours."" This season lacks that kind of intensity. Perhaps aggressive editing to reach five episodes could have helped achieve that, while simultaneously cutting out discursions that open doors to glaring plot holes and contradictions.Reading what I've just written, I realize it looks like I hated this season. Not so; where it hasn't been Americanized, or where it doesn't lapse into melancholy navel-gazing, it has plenty of good going on. But instead of tightening its belt and keeping focus on its best virtues, it lazes through a labyrinth of trivia. This season is okay, but only okay.

1452159,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005A5IAC0,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[10, 13]","For the first time, the Torchwood team (or what's left of it) head to America for this ambitious ten part series for the Starz network. In Captain Jack Harkness, creator Russell T. Davies and actor John Barrowman created a truly unique warrior for the science fiction and paranormal set. The dashing bi-sexual hero was first introduced on Davies' ""Dr. Who"" reinvention and quickly became a fan favorite. So, it was with some amount of excitement that I followed Barrowman to his own show expecting some variation of the ""Dr. Who"" narrative. But no, the show was stylized in a very different way. The ""Torchwood"" spin-off played like a high octane and oftentimes quite amusing cousin to the ""X-files."" For two seasons, the show exceeded as adult escapism at every level. The controversial miniseries ""Children of Earth"" redefined everything in the Torchwood universe and is alternately loved and hated by the show's most fervent fans. For my money, though, it was a dark and unforgettable experience.""Miracle Day"" arrives some time after the remaining Torchwood members have disbanded and are in seclusion. Miracle Day refers to the show's dynamic premise--one day, no one in the world dies. No matter how traumatic an injury or illness, death has simply vanished as an option. As simple as that, the entire world faces a universal dilemma about what constitutes life. The ethical, societal, political, economic, and practical ramifications of an ever expanding world population sets the entire planet into a frenzy. It seems that the occurrence might have been knowingly orchestrated by unseen entities and expected by large pharmaceutical interests. More concerning, it may have to do with Barrowman's Harkness. Previously immortal, Harkness is experiencing the opposite effect of everyone else--now he is vulnerable to injury. And he (as well as Gwen and her family) are on the firing line.The show's concept, in this case, is the star. Complicated and truly thought provoking, the idea behind Miracle Day raises so many intriguing questions. More akin to ""Children of Earth"" than to the original show, if you disliked that miniseries--you will no doubt be disappointed in this as well. And while I don't think that this incarnation has the operatic grandeur of ""Children of Earth,"" it still works on its own terms. It doesn't, however, feel particularly like the Torchwood you've come to know--this is an entirely different beast. With only a couple of the original cast members left, the program relies on many new faces. Mekhi Phifer is a new lead, filled with bluster and bravado, and is not someone I particularly connected with. More successful is Bill Pullman as a messianic death row inmate who survived his execution, Arlene Tur as a doctor caught up in the unraveling the medical conspiracy, Lauren Ambrose as an unscrupulous public relations agent, and Alexa Havins as a CIA analyst who finds herself in the field.Again, it is the plot that is the most intriguing aspect of ""Miracle Day."" With so many new characters and such a broad international narrative, I sometimes felt Barrowman was sidelined. I always want more Jack! But the intricate mythology and the unraveling conspiracies compensate for this disappointment. As the days progress, the world plunges deeper into a ruthless government state and the fate of humanity is once again in the hands of the Torchwood team. An easy recommendation, despite some minor reservations.

1452164,AV4645DYR9KUL,B005A5IAC0,Kyle N.,"[2, 3]","Following the wonderful Torchwood miniseries, ""Children of Earth"", Russell T. Davies gave Torchwood another shift in direction and kept the miniseries aspect that started with ""Children of Earth"". In this case, however, Torchwood: Miracle Day, is a co-production between the BBC Worldwide and the U.S. television network, Starz. This lead to a season that feels a lot more American and doesn't quite feel wholly like Torchwood. Torchwood: Miracle Day is not a completely terrible season, but it loses so much of what made Torchwood a special show and a worthy sister show to Doctor Who.Torchwood often dealt with death in its first three seasons, however never to this level. One day, people all over the world stop dying. No matter what physical ailment their body goes through (bombing, impalment, sickness, etc.), the living consciousness cannot leave a person's body. Two CIA agents, Rex Matheson (Mekhi Phifer) and Esther Drummond (Alexa Havins) begin to investigate this ""Miracle"", while trying to find out who ""Torchwood"" is after a message gets sent out across networks saying only that very word. Meanwhile, Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) and Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) come out of retirement (reluctantly) to find out what is going on.Torchwood proved in ""Children of Earth"" that it could tell a phenomenal plot over the course of a shorter than normal season, and Russell T. Davies proved that he was excellent at mysterious overarching narratives in Doctor Who as well. However, despite the workings of Russell T. Davies and several other talented writers (both American and British), Miracle Day's narrative just falls short in many ways. The ""Miracle"" is an initially interesting premise, one that shows promise and fits in excellently with Torchwood's themes, but the resolution and treatment of the mystery just feels convoluted and uninteresting. It's development (the cause, the explanation, etc.) just doesn't really ever make sense, and the ultimate villains don't feel like Torchwood. In a way, the problem is that the threat isn't actually aliens or anything extraterrestrial. Although this would easily work with any other show (in fact, the idea of a corporation going to these lengths to make a profit is very American), Torchwood is not a grounded show by any means, and it shouldn't be. There are some interesting analyses of the Miracle, and the results of this ""catastrophe"" are definitely explored fully, but in the end, the ultimate impact of the mystery and overarching narrative just feel uninteresting and noticeably not Torchwood. This is all on top of awful pacing and plotting. ""Children of Earth"" benefited highly from its short episode count. With only five episodes to tell its story, the pacing was perfect, with every scene moving along the plot and character development and never meandering around. ""Miracle Day"" is not like that. It's plot stretches out over ten episodes and feels like it just meanders around, moving ever so slowly towards its conclusion. Sure, it fills its time with details and revelations, but it all feels slow and pointless. Several scenes and plot lines feel like they exist for no reasons (Rex's father and Esther's sister, among several more), and some are built to be important only to feel pointless by the time the finale rolls around (Angelo, anyone?).The character development is not as strong as it used to be, either. The new main cast members Rex, Esther, and Bill Pullman are not as interesting or well-developed characters as one would hope, either. Rex feels too bombastically American, and while some may enjoy that, others won't, and his character never gets much growth or interesting development. Esther gets more and represents the most likable of the new cast, mostly just because she is an all-around nice character. However, she is underutilized and underdeveloped, getting only some actual character development in a single episode. Bill Pullman also seems interesting at first, and is initially built to be pretty likable and sympathetic, but that falls by the wayside and his character just seems like one that the writers tried too hard to make interesting while also making him seem somewhat villainous or cunning. In the end, his character doesn't gain much growth or actual significance until the final episode. Jack and Gwen don't really feel at their fullest here, either. Gwen, for example, gets no more character development, and it feels like that has taken away some of the reason to keep Torchwood even going. Stories are about the growth of the main character, which in this case is Gwen, and once that growth has stopped, the story ends. Gwen has turned into an excellent soldier and agent, and her growth seems like it ended long ago, and without it, it seems pointless for her character to even be on the show (look at Owen; his character died, permanently, once his character arc had reached its end). Jack doesn't get much growth, either, although that's not a huge problem, because his growth was never key like others' (although, he did show growth in earlier seasons, and it is missed). The secondary cast isn't much better. Despite some promise, Dr. Vera Juarez (Arlene Tur) doesn't seem to grow much or really become a very complex character; Jilly Kitzinger (Lauren Ambrose) gets some development and importance, but doesn't really amount to that much, either; and the villains get no development whatsoever, something that doesn't improve their villainy (the 456 were great not because they stayed undeveloped, but because the perfect amount of development and details were given to prove they were to be feared). Ultimately, the characters just never seem to excite or get the viewers emotionally involved, either.""Miracle Day"" is decent on a production level, but really only so much to go unnoticed. The effects on several ""deaths"" are great. Moments like the blown-up man in ""The New World"" or the backwards head in ""Rendition"" are definitely excellent and perfectly creepy effects. However, not much else really exists, since aliens don't seem to exist in Torchwood. The imagination and creativity in creating alien species and their place in our world is gone here. The soundtrack is decent enough, with the Torchwood theme playing in places here and there, but ultimately it does not amaze as with other shows or seasons of this very show.Overall, Torchwood: Miracle Day is a major disappointment. Some fans may enjoy it, but its shift in style will prove divisive for many, and its promising premise and promising characters in the end wind up not fulfilling expectations. Without its creative uses of aliens and time travel, excellent characterization and development, and interesting plots, ""Miracle Day"" just doesn't feel like Torchwood anymore.",2,An Americanized

I watched Children of Earth, but I'm not sure I can watch it again, in spite of some stellar performances( Peter Capaldi comes to mind), it being so gruesome.Yes , series 4 has many flaws that were pointed out, what bothered me was the total lack of humor, the CSI style, and the weakest link aka Alexa Havins, haven't seen such a ditz portraying a geek since Denise Richards did her stint as a nuclear scientist in James Bond! I really wasn't impressed with the other CIA agents either, all too wooden  or too eager, with the notable exception of John de Lancie.Now the interesting part is Bill Pullman as a psycho killer, I think he delivers an uncanny performance, a man at the edges of Hell. I got a kick watching Lauren Ambrose, she makes the only attempts at humor in the series.The Wales parts bring a breath of fresh air, compared to the stale, prime time networkTV when in LA.But...it does get better...if you can survive the explicit sex scenes of all sorts, I preferred the subtle scenes in the initial series though ( remember the Jack-Jack kiss? )Those had chemistry and they were sexy! series 4 offers a lot of nudity but no chemistry! Sometimes, less is more!Now, starting with episode 7, things move quickly! The plot finally gets out of the concentration camps and the last episodes are intense and thrilling! And the ending did not disappoint! ( except maybe the implication that they will continue collaborating with the CIA, wasn't thrilled at the thought!)So, overall, the truth is once I started watching it, I was glued to the TV! It was interesting enough to have me stay up at night to see what happens next, which is a good thing! I missed the old series' tight, funny and sexy scripts though! Yes, it is oh so good to see Jack and Gwen together again, and Rhys looks magnificent even though they mostly use him as babysitter! And please bring the focus back on Jack, not Rex, he is not up to the task, I had trouble believing in the character.I have no idea what' s happening with the series, I really wish badly that they go back to Wales and continue it though.

Torchwood worked outside the law, and was not without its fascistic side (though not quite as bad as MI-5, as presented in the series of that name). Also, although it was part of his character, I found rather irritating the frequent references to or demonstrations of Captain Jack Harkness's lighthearted sensuality. I fear, also, that creator Russell T. Davis had a strong inclination to the maudlin.

And there is no chance for Torchwood to be fascistic, since it is on the run throughout. As for the virtues:1) A truly serious science-fiction idea, treated (for the most part) seriously; one that has really serious social and human consequences and terrific dramatic possibilities.2) Excellent writing, a goodly part of which I gather was due to Jane Espenson.3) Excellent acting, particularly: the two C.I.A. agents, ""Rex Matheson"" (Mekhi Phifer) and ""Esther Drummond"" (Alexa Havins, looking like a younger Julie Benz); and especially Bill Pullman as ""Oswald Danes"" (his performance should have been Emmy-bait). Eve Myles (""Gwen Cooper"") I have always liked, and Lauren Ambrose is a delight. C. Thomas Howell is nicely threatening in a small part, and John D.

1452180,A33775AIB1A664,B005A5IAC0,"Mark Colan ""duke-of-url""","[0, 0]","NO SPOILERS for THIS EPISODE; minor spoilers for earlier episodes.OVERVIEWWe started the first season of Torchwood, saw a few episodes, got interrupted, and didn't get back to it.  It was several months later that I heard a review of Miracle Day and a little about its intriguing syopsis, and decided that we should start Torchwood all over from the beginning.  All of it, especially Miracle Day, was worth it.I have deliberately avoided reading reviews of Miracle Day until I write this, but I cannot fail to notice that many have given it low stars.  Clearly, Miracle Day is a major departure for Torchwood, which in previous episodes has gradually lost several of its key team members and now appears to be building a new team.  It also moves from England to mostly USA, and overall it has a new feel.  Fans often do not like change, so bad reviews in the face of change are inevitable.For me, Children of Earth and Miracle Day were really refreshing changes from the one-hour episodes of the first two seasons.  The worst thing I would say about Miracle Day is that it appears that they decided first to make it 10 episodes, then had to figure out how to fill 10 episodes, and at times that got a bit tedious.  The episodes are uneven; some great, some a bit flabby.  With editing, and outside of the episode format, it would be really solid in 7-8 hours.THE STORYIn traditional one-hour stories of Torchwood, there was a whole team, and many episodes took a personal focus on one of the characters and gave us some back story on them.  But now we have only two original team members, and they both have significant focus and insight into their personal lives over the course of the 10 episodes.Traditional Torchwood generally involved some kind of alien or non-human or human variant and, on the surface, there is none to be seen here.  In fact, there are two.  It is no secret that Jack is an immortal, and we're not sure if he is exactly human; at least we know that he is not from the present time.  I cannot discuss the other without spoiling the story, except to say that it is not an alien in the usual sense and may not be apparent as one of the non-humans even after you have seen it.  After thinking it through, the focus on non-humans or human-variants is true to form classic Torchwood.An interesting change of pace in this story is that references to Doctor Who are present, which I believe has only happened rarely and briefly, if ever, before.  In watching the modern Doctor Who (which we started after watching Torchwood through Children of Earth), there are MANY references to Torchwood, even though the show did not yet exist, and we even meet most of the Torchwood crew, including Captain Jack Harkness.Again, without spoilers, it is hard to say much about the story except to say that Jack, Gwen, Rhys, and some new characters all featured prominently, had strong roles and played them well; the episodes held my interest; some were great and some were not so much.  On average, the episodes earn four stars (I Like It) from me.THE DVDThe DVD is simply a means of watching the show.  DVDs are often rather annoying because they contain stuff I don't want to see and can't skip, but that's true for all DVDs.  In the past, BBC DVDs have been friendlier than most, but this one is worse.  For every episode, we had to watch fierce warnings about piracy for a DVD we had already procured legally in two languages.  Then a couple of fancy logos for somebody's ego.Eventually we get to the show and it starts with Jack and the writer trying to get us excited and encourage us to watch an episode that we are already here to see, telling us what's about to happen and explaining it to us, all of which is quite unnecessary.  Really, they are trying too hard.  Next, for every episode, an animation about the premise of the show, along the lines of the first day, nobody died.  Then the next day, nobody died.  And so on.  And then reminders of what happend in the last episode, which we kind of remember since we saw that episode last night or maybe 5 minutes ago.  Finally, the episode.But what is really unfortunate is that unlike all previous Torchwood and Dr Who DVDs we have seen, there is no disc that goes through each episode to interview the actors, producers, and special effects people to talk about how it was made, giving us a better appreciation and deeper understanding for how it all worked.BOTTOM LINEI liked Children of Earth even better, but I was not disappointed by Miracle Day.  I miss the old team, but Torchwood needed some freshening.

1452183,AZ4Q3VAK6CIJS,B005A5IAC0,Mary Esterhammer-Fic,"[0, 1]","My husband and I are fans of the Torchwood series, so we were looking forward to ""Miracle Day"". But this last arc of episodes was often tedious, at times disappointing, and occasionally offensive.Torchwood is an arm of British intelligence that addresses alien invasions, and its leader is the intrepid , immortal Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman).  Jack is very handsome and charming. Jack was originally  a character in the Dr. Who universe, and like Dr. Who, this series is cleverly developed and fun.But by the end of the last story arc, the Torchwood headquarters and team were destroyed. ""Miracle Day"" finds surviving Torchwood agent Gwen settled into an anonymous life with her family in rural Wales. Jack is gone, as in ""off the planet"" gone.Then, suddenly, reality gets turned on its head: death disappears. Nobody dies.Society edges toward collapse as the world tries to cope with an ever-expanding, never-dying population.  How did this happen, who's behind it, and how can this unnatural order be reversed?Captain Jack reappears, Gwen gets pulled back into the fight, and they team up with two CIA agents to hunt down answers, so they can, once again, save the world.""Miracle Day"" has lots of plot twists and unlikely characters, so it's interesting to watch as the story unfolds. It's also campy and self-mocking, which is fun. You can tell the actors really enjoy these episodes.But I was disappointed by some of the developments in ""Miracle Day.""Here, Captain Jack is now waaaaay out of the closet as a gay man. This has been building over the previous story-lines: his sexual preferences were hinted at, then revealed, then he launched a romance with another male Torchwood agent. Okay, Jack has supposedly lived thousands of lifetimes, so it's no surprise he's experienced much on the sexuality spectrum, and that he would currently settle into a gay lifestyle. But now he's out and proud, and snarky, and manipulative and picking up random sex partners at bars. There's a direct and strong correlation between his overt identity as a gay man and his becoming more self-absorbed and less likable.I thought the writers handled Jack's gayness pretty well, initially. It was just one aspect of who he was. But now it's THE central fact of his life. Really? He's had millenia to get used to his orientation and behave a little bit maturely, and this is the best he can do? Do the writers--or John Barrowman, who at this point probably has a lot of creative control--think that gay people are naturally insufferable if they're allowed to be open in this regard? Kind of stereotype-y, dontcha think?But then they attack groups that are not part of the Rainbow Revolution, or so they think.Never mind the villainous ""Tea Party candidate"" who is crushed into a cube at a junkyard (but left alive). There are probably people who think there's no such thing as a gay Republican or conservative--just like Iran's president claimed there are no gay Iranians--but I suggest that the only people who really buy into this are liberal gays. FYI: there's a lot of diversity, even of political opinion, within the gay community, just as in the world at large. To actually NAME the Tea Party and then paint it like this is lazy and intolerant.Far worse is the Catholic-bashing that is incorporated into this show. This is probably just as much a function of the fact that it's a British production, and a lot of Brits HATE the Roman Catholic Church, and anyone who belongs to it. (While simultaneously patting themselves on the back for their ""tolerance"" in other areas.)The first anti-Catholic volley is fired when the issue of quality-of-life comes up in a discussion among doctors. A sentimental, weak, chubby physician advocates for the dignity of all people, but he's shot down by the glamorous whip-smart female ER doc who snaps, ""I used to be Catholic, but I got BETTER!"" See, Catholicism is a disease, and one that probably wouldn't get triaged into the ""worth saving"" category.Not to mention, if you substitute into that scene the name of ANY religious or cultural group for ""Catholic,"" the producers wouldn't DARE leave that in the final edit.Then we have Jack and his love affair with an Italian immigrant, Angelo, in 1920's New York.In one scene that takes place in a Catholic church, Jack goes into a confessional and mocks the sacrament of penance. Then he has a transaction with a priest for wine, which he'll bootleg, and mocks the Precious Blood.I can't even begin to convey how offensive this is to Catholics. That it's done with kind of a wink-wink to the audience is revolting.But then there's the scene that follows Angelo's discovery that Captain Jack Harkness can't be killed. He can be shot through the heart, but after several minutes he'll wake up. Angelo freaks out, and tells others in his building, and soon Jack finds himself shackled to a pipe overhead while ""Ignorant Italian Immigrants"" crowd around, stabbing and shooting him to watch him die, then revive, and then they stab and shoot him again.The whole time, the ""Ignorant Italian Immigrants"" gasp, repeatedly make the sign of the cross, catch his blood in bottles, pray aloud, and behave ridiculously. This stereotype of southern Europeans who cling to a 2000-year-old superstition is highly offensive, and I'm not even an Italian immigrant. I am surprised the Catholic League and the Sons of Italy haven't launched a protest about this. It really is over the top.And Jack being hung up and tortured while blood runs from his wounds is a not-so-subtle reference to the Mathew Shepard case in Wyoming, where the (gay) college kid was tortured to death and then strung up on a barbed-wire fence. Making a mockery of that young man's death is disrespectful to the Shepard family and to Mathew's legacy. What happened to Mathew Shepard was NOT entertainment. Shame on the producers for letting this scene be shot.I can't say I look forward to the next Torchwood series. I like a lot of the characters, including Jack, and I hope he tones down his act a little in the future. You can be gay AND a regular guy, you know.And I hope the production team works on being a bit more open-minded and accepting of others who may not share their  political, religious or ethnic backgrounds. Emulating the Know Nothing Party is not cool, and doing so makes them look like jerks.",2,Jack's back....and he's a bit obnoxious,1395360000,"03 21, 2014",2014,6353,"['husband', 'are', 'fans',

1452189,A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L,B005A5IAC0,Michael Valdivielso,"[6, 8]","First off, let me say I am a huge fan of Doctor Who and Torchwood.  I love the characters played by Eve Myles, John Barrowman and found delight in many of the American stars who were brought in to play their parts such as John de Lancie and, a favorite, C. Thomas Howell.  And Bill Pullman is a wonderful actor who can truly play a sick, twisted, scary man.Saying that, I must say I felt that the show was at least two or three episodes too long, there were too many scenes and sub-plots I felt were not needed, and to be honest maybe too many sex scenes.  I mean, yes, it is Torchwood.  Yes, mature themes and explosions.  But story and character development is the major feature of any good Torchwood episode.  And even those were overshadowed with too many details, flashbacks, and complex plots within plots within plots.Maybe if I had watched it over a period of a month instead of one sitting I would not have felt, near the end, bored and not at all interested in the final reveal.  I do not wish to spoil anything but the final episode, after all that building up to it, was a weak, almost lame, ending.  I kind of got, in the last few episodes, the impression they ran out of money, or imagination, or both.Also, I have to say that the character of Rex Matheson came across as a Bull in a China shop - powerful and tough but not as smart or as flexible as a top CIA agent should be.

Never have i seen idiot drama in russel Davies material. the runnig time could have been cut almost in half and got the story in AND had the humor we like not this ""uh your dumb goyim so  we need to make our charachters be unaware idiots  that you scream 'look! look!' at the tv"". Rex is supposed to be the great stategist and plays his part yet in the first ""ovens"" firing he pounds and jerks at a door stronger than a bank vault like a mad ape instead of hunting down whos working the controls and reversing them to save her life.Come On! So now we have that hollywood  ""oh you should be following the soldier"" then she calls over and over when theirs something obviously wrong and DOESNT call rex HER CIA PARTNER..hello??? a good 40 minutes could cut out and kept it moving if he found the bad guy on the controls kiils him for that revenge exitement. Then a WHOLE graphic episode on Jacks gayness which in BBC torchwood was more of an alien thing where hes got sexuall power on both sexes. This is hollywood gutter perverity and PC crap. that and leads americans watching starz to think BBC is all about gays (if they never seen torchwood before).

How about ONE movie about the Dresden holocaust, or nagasaki, or toyko, a drama following a families life through that..oh no. Or Lazr kognavich who slaughter Christain Russians in the communist birth battlecry (leave nothing but the synagogues standing!""

I didnt want political crap in my torchwood fun, epscially something that is repeated over and over and over.. I PAID for this??

1452213,A16QODENBJVUI1,B005A5IAC0,Robert Moore,"[2, 5]","I have just finished watching the finale of TORCHWOOD: MIRACLE DAY. My initial reaction to the miniseries was one of disappointment. The previous miniseries, which some call Season Three (in my own mind, there are two seasons of the show and then two miniseries), CHILDREN OF EARTH, was one of the best things that TV SF has had to offer so far this century. It was shocking from almost the very beginning and made compulsive viewing. MIRACLE DAY had a great initial premise and then the show began to waffle around for a while. There were a lot of redundant or ineffective scenes that seemed to consist of the Torchwood members - old and new - sitting around in rooms hiding from the authorities. The pace was slow and the narrative a tad sluggish.It got better. But not necessarily all that coherent. I don't want to provide any major spoilers, but the explanation for the cause of Miracle Day was not particularly convincing. Scientifically it is absurd and tilts more towards fantasy than SF (not that bad of a thing; STAR WARS has always been a whole lot of fantasy with a tiny smidgen of SF), but one has to remember that Captain Jack became immortal when graced (cursed?) by the inability to die by a temporarily deified Rose on DOCTOR WHO, so there has always been a whole lot of the fantastic on TORCHWOOD that is removed from rational explanation.As with CHILDREN OF EARTH, much of the show's dynamic comes from a sense of the governments of the world exerting power over individuals, ignoring their rights. In CHILDREN OF EARTH, however, the governments of the world were forced to their decisions by an absolutely impossible situation created by an alien race. In MIRACLE DAY it was caused by an elite wielding enormous economic power over the entire world population, an elite determined to create a new oligarchic rule even if it means that only a tiny portion of the earth's population survives. The story clearly combines two notions that more and more people are coming to believe:  1) that government no longer works for the interests of regular people but 2) instead works close to exclusively for the interests of those with money. In a way, the show works with the conceit that we already have  a plutocracy that has supplanted democracy (that we have, in Sheldon Wolin's words, an ""inverted totalitarianism"").A lot of the problem with show is with the writing. A lot of elements are introduced with no warning, such as the sudden insertion of a story of a romance Jack has with an immigrant in New York just before the Depression. This and other things are just plopped down at convenient moments when needed, instead of their being an organic part of the narrative.Nonetheless, I enjoyed the series overall.  I liked some of the new characters as well as some of the familiar faces. And while it is possible that this will be the end of TORCHWOOD (the ratings were solid for Starz, but the rumor is that Russell T. Davies has little interest in continuing his relationship with the franchise, instead wanting to move on to other projects), there was a nice set up towards the end to add another member to the Torchwood team on a permanent basis.In terms of quality, MIRACLE DAY is less like the stellar quality of CHILDREN OF EARTH and more like the quality of the first two seasons of the series.

This Showtime version brings the remains of the team (John Barrowman and the ever interesting Eve Miles) to the USA and adds Mekhi Phifer as a government agent. I really like Phifer, but I have to say he has some of the worst lines in the show, especially where he videos himself spilling the beans about the government cremations centers. My favorite is when he tells Category 1's (comatose patients) to avoid the centers, how I don't know.Since it is Starz there's more sex, especially between Capt Jack (Harkness) and his male paramours. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the sheer ambition, what happens if people simply stop dying? Government response and that of individuals are both realistic and chilling, and the series explores them well. There's even a twist ending (well, two of them)in the ultimate world saving moment and after the funeral (true to BBC habits not all the main characters live). And there's a hint of continuing the story, although Russell T Davies put the series on &#34;Indefinite hiatus&#34; in late 2012.Oh yes, Bill Pullman plays a smarmy, slimy child killer reprieved by the miracle, redeeming himself at the end for the American audiences, and the delightful Lauren Ambrose as a PR specialist, who generates one of the best lines of the movie - during the climax, while fighting to control an elevator, Eve Myles looks at her and says &#34;How can you wear so much lipstick!!!!!&#34;.

1452236,A1ZUL48XKNLOJ0,B005A5IAC0,Tevis Fen-Kortiay,"[16, 32]","TV show creators write a ""series bible"" to give the writers info like character motivation and broad plot points.  It was presumably series creator Russell Davies who had the ingenious idea of basing the Miracle Day series bible on the actual Christian Bible, exploring the current healthcare crisis as an allegorical retelling of the Book of Revelation.On the Day of Revelation, the dead rise and walk = Miracle DayWhore of Babylon traditionally wears all red = Jilly KitzingerThe Anti-Christ = Oswald Danes (he raped and murdered Suzie Cabena, who probably represents the Lamb of God, since the word Cabena originally referred to a cabin erected where sheep graze)People are judged; some are sent to Hell = Category-1 people are burned in ovensWhat finally clinched it for me they're retelling the Book of Revelation = Jilly tells Oswald the keynote for his speech should be the word ""Revelation""Both Rex and Jack experience miraculous rebirths & represent Christ:Rex = ""king"" (Christ is ""king of kings"")Matheson really means ""Son of the Bear"" or ""Son of Heroes,"" but here means ""Son of God""Rex's chest wound = wound in Christ's sideColin Maloney jamming his pen in Rex's wound (while he's chained to a metal pole) = the Roman soldier Longinus piercing Christ's wound with his spear while he's on the cross.  This scene is echoed when Jack is tortured for his blood, then Angelo jabs a knife in Jack's side, and Jack is again wounded in his side as the series draws to a conclusion.The big mystery behind Phicorp is called ""The Blessing""; Oswald compares mankind to angels, and Phicorp to arch-angels; Gwen says ""There will be Hell to pay""; Jilly says ""...it's my job to sell it, even if that means I have to strike a bargain with the Devil himself""; Stuart Owens (played by Ernie Hudson, character name means ""noble steward"") says ""You think I'm the epitome of evil; the Devil himself in a three-piece suit.""The 3 Families are referred to at one point as ""The 3 Wise Families"" because the three founders are the 3 Wise Men/Magi who witnessed the birth of Christ.  Their triangle symbol, formed when they join arms while agreeing to exploit Jack's immortal blood, resembles the Eye of Providence (representing God), as seen on the back of US Dollar Bills.  ""The Blessing,"" a giant cleft in the Earth, alludes to ""The Abyss"" from the Book of Revelation.  When looking at the Abyss, Gwen says ""My God.""Characters Esther Drummond, her sister Sarah and Noah Vickers (analyst who worked with Esther) have Biblical names; Dr. Vera Juarez's first name means ""faith""; Maloney means ""Devoted to God""; Jillian means ""youthful""; Colin means ""young creature""; Oswald means ""God's power""; People wear ""pegs"" to show their Category (1-4).  These may refer to the ""Mark of the Beast."" The ""alien parasite"" is snake-like and so probably the serpent who tempted Eve in the Garden of Eden (making Jack and Angelo ""Adam and Steve"").It seems very likely the episodic antagonists represent the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse: Pestilence, War, Famine and Death. The Triangle Assassin (played by C. Thomas Howell), given his profession and bone-white hair, is Death. Colin Maloney, letting people die under his watch, is probably Pestilence.  I haven't been able to match the others (and not willing to sit through series again), but I'm confident the matches are there to be found.Series creator Russell Davies has referenced The Book of Revelation at least twice before: in his 2003 serial ""The Second Coming"" (in which Jesus is reborn, played by actor Christopher Eccleston) and episode 113 of Torchwood, ""End of Days"" (in which a Godzilla-sized Abaddon stalks Cardiff).One end of the Abyss is in Buenos Aires, Argentina, which is 92% Roman Catholic. Most of the story is set in the Western world and uses Catholic symbolism. The other end is in Shanghai, China, where most people follow the Chinese folk religion. Jack and Rex both represent Christ throughout the series, and both pose in crucifix posture during their final self-sacrifice, but they're also black- and white-skinned men on opposite sides of the Earth = yin & yang (hinted at when their heterosexual and homosexual sex scenes are intercut).  Rex becoming immortal is yang-into-yin and though I cannot identify it, Jack probably gains some quality from Rex. The yin/yang symbolism is hinted at by the Chinese folk religion altar in the hallway behind the Chinese restaurant at the Shanghai entrance to the Abyss.  Super bonus points to Davies for cleverly using mostly Christian allegory without restricting the story to only a Christian interpretation.***Non-biblically, Mayor Ellis Hartley Monroe is a member of the Tea Party.  She references ex-governor of Alaska Sarah Louise Palin.  The concentration camps and death-ovens represent Palin's claims that President Obama's healthcare proposals would create death panels that kill our grandparents.So what's all this ""morphic fields"" business?  That's the signature claim of Rupert Sheldrake, who Salon calls ""The Delightful Crackpot.""  Crackpot because, despite his Ph.D in biology from Cambridge, Sheldrake famously denounces science as just another unsupported dogma, like the Flat-Earthers.  He paints scientists as a borderline-evil, irrational, domineering patriarchy (three guesses what subject his father was most interested in).  What science calls cause and effect is an illusion, Sheldrake claims: you don't look like your parents because you inherited their DNA, but because all patterns, once created, resonate out in all directions through space-time as""morphic fields""(from the Greek morph meaning 'shape').  Sheldrake's more recent work argues thatdogs have ESP.Sheldrake's appeal is very similar to Erich von D&auml;niken, who proposes that human culture was launched byancient alien astronauts-- neither theory stands up to even five minutes of scrutiny (von D&auml;niken was even caught red-handed falsifying evidence in the 1978 Nova episode ""The Case of the Ancient Astronauts""), but people find these wish-fulfillment ideas so poetic and appealing that no amount of counter-evidence or reason can dislodge them as perennial New Age myths.Up till now, Torchwood has always been science fantasy, which helpfully does not require the writers to understand or explain how it all works; this ""morphogenic fields"" idea marks the first time a Torchwood story is built up from a scientific claim that is flatly wrong.  [Painful mental image of a roomful of television writers agreeing ""Darn!  None of us understand how 'morphogenic fields' could possibly make sense given the laws of physics or common sense.  (Pause.) ...But none of us know what 'ad hominem fallacy' means, either, and this guy has a Phd from Cambridge!""]  If they pulled off a good story, I wouldn't care -- for example, von D&auml;niken's crackpot idea was used to good effect inBattlestar Galactica,Stargate, and evenAlien Vs. Predator.***Traditional review: I must admit, I mostly only enjoyed this series because of the fun matches with the Christian Bible and the healthcare crisis.  When Angelo's granddaughter sent armed men to capture Gwen's family to force her to kidnap Jack for them - even though Jack would have come to see Angelo immediately without any coercion - that broke the story for me.  Wayne Knight's character could have met all his goals by just shooting everyone, but chose to delay until his superiors arrived for no reason.  Rex intentionally tipped off the CIA where to find them, but didn't even allow a 30-minute window to make sure he and his friends learned what they needed to know about the Three Families before the CIA arrived.  The Three Families could make The Miracle permanent by burying both ends of the abyss, but like Dr. Evil they dawdle on pressing the button apparently simply to give the heroes the chance to thwart them.  These characters are willing to throw away their lives and sacrifice everything they've ever worked toward just so lazy writers get an easy cliff-hanger every 44 minutes.  When Rex was miraculously reborn via Jack's blood, I couldn't roll my eyes hard enough.Primary writer Jane Espenson seems like a very likeable person from her interviews, but I am very unhappy with what she did to Buffy, Galactica, and Torchwood.  I seldom notice who wrote a TV show unless it's very good or very bad, but Espenson's work has jumped out at me.  She once won a Hugo award for cowriting an excellent Buffy episode, but since then I've been disappointed in a favorite program several times only to notice her name in the credits.  Google for ""Battlestar Galactica"" and ""worst episodes"" and you'll see that Espenson's ""The Passage"" and ""The Plan"" are nearly always at the top of the worst episode lists, but in interviews she often refers to them as ""fan favorites."" Hmph.Brilliant series creator Russell Davies hasstated in printthat he's completely drained of science fiction ideas and his emotional investment is now focused on his upcoming show about middle-aged gay men, Cucumber.  Cut the number of episodes by half, move Espenson to another project better-suited to her strengths (like Gilmore Girls) and coax an emotionally-invested Davies into writing the scripts, and this could have been another fantastic series like 'Children of Earth.'  Given that Davies is really only focused on Cucumber, though, I would have preferred if he had turned down the $$ and walked away rather than delivering this half-hearted stinker.",2,"Ingenious series

And for the life of me I just don't know why they would think that? Is this season different - yes. Is it still great Torchwood and great television - yes. It seems to me to be a bit 'darker' than before but not morbid. Most of the characters from the other seasons are gone but the storytelling is still top notch and, of course, Capt. Jack and Gwen keep the action and suspense going full tilt. Also (and I will NOT give anything away) the last episode is chock full of surprises. Now - that said, I cannot wait for the next series.

Torchwood's original mission is a distant memory and the storyline in this 10 part mini-series is filled with continuity errors and forgettable characters and none of the feel or excitement of the original series.  It's incongruous to me that the British TV shows like to kill off major and sympathetic characters with gusto.  Only Jack, Gwen and Reese (along with a secondary policeman) continue from the original series (because everyone else is dead). If you are a Torchwood fan you already know these things.  The mini-series Children of the Earth was grim enough, but this one tries to take grim to a whole new level.  If you were a true fan of the original series perhaps you'd be better off skipping this one--and spoiler alert--it seemed to be somewhat open ended implying they thought they were going to make another mini-series--but thankfully I can't find any references to a revival on the web.  I almost did not watch the whole series through because I wanted to find out what the mystery behind it all was--but with it's rather anti-climatic ending even that was not satisfactory.  I don't think the writers knew where the hell they were going with it all--several promising subplots were never fully developed.

1452241,A1S1KD13WDD7OA,B005A5IAC0,T.Kellie,"[2, 2]","*If you don't want to read all of this at least skip to the last paragraph. It's the best advice I can offer regarding this Miracle Day mess*After watching all of the new Doctor Who series within a few months I decided to check out Torchwood. I loved the first three sets, despite the tragic deaths of characters I've grown to care about over the last few weeks. Then there's Miracle Day, I don't understand what happened here. I feel like I was watching some weird mini series that just happened to have Gwen (who I loved in this) and Jack (who hasn't really seemed right since the end of season 2 except for at the end of Children Of Earth). I liked Esther and I found Rex amusing enough. I just don't understand what the writers were trying to accomplish here. Was this an attempt at a Torchwood reboot? There weren't even any aliens! Was this an attempt to bring Torchwood over to the US and make it an American show? I'm confused. I would have rather watched this for free albeit edited on BBC America than bought it. I can't really accept this as Torchwood and I definitely can't accept this as happening in the same universe as Doctor Who. The ending was clearly not intended to be the series finale but maybe it's for the best that it is (for now). Things really fall apart around episode 5 or 6. Had I spent years watching Torchwood, I would loathe Miracle Day. Instead I watched it over a few weeks and it just confuses me. I'm being nice and giving it a 7/10. Can't give half stars but I've settled on giving 3. The first few episodes aren't bad and Gwen was the best part of this anomaly. Eve Myles' performance stood out above the rest, 5 stars for her. This coming from someone who wasn't particularly fond of Gwen through most of season 1.So either save yourself the trouble and skip this entirely (which I recommend unless you REALLY miss Jack and Gwen), or watch the ENTIRE thing for free/super cheap somewhere, then decide if you want to commit to buying the DVD.

1452242,A96JD9312DHWC,B005A5IAC0,"TorridlyBoredShopper ""T(to the)B(to the)S""","[9, 16]","Miracle Day, when all the dying stops.  No more watching your loved ones leave you. No more having to say goodbye.Sounds great, huh?The problem with that is that the suffering doesn't go away and the ravages of age and disease do not simply vanish. There is simply no end. Hospitals overcrowd, issues with food become abundant, the world overcrowds. On top of these is an issue of how the suffering are seen and classified, where the sick go, how to treat injuries or long-term care. The world has gone mad, something is behind it, and one name seems to be connected to it all. Torchwood.Originally appearing on Starz, this series was an American outing into an otherwise British forum. You can tell that from a lot of the people that were added to the fray, and some of the agencies added to the chase. Now you have the FBI involved and the American economy coming to the forefront in the discussion of what should or should not take place, and it is different. I personally liked that because I know how a lot of that works, but others might not because it is different and because it required Torchwood to be imported to the USA.As far as a story, I liked Miracle Day. The idea itself is huge, almost too big really, and that made it nice. Many of the episodes were filled with ""look at this issue"" moments, and those made an impact. As a viewer I caught myself asking questions about what would happen and many of the ideas they threw out went beyond the basics. I also liked the idea of how the characters worked. Not only did you have more people to work with Torchwood and more types of baddies, but you had oddities like groups and what they believed, the suffering, and you had the disposable. In a way I thought this seemed more impacting, because it showed how much was up for grabs and just how dangerous it could be. I also liked the thing being hidden when people hit Category 3, and what the plan there was. This could have been a season of shows instead of a special, and I would've liked seeing that play out. That said, it was good.As far as the actors, I really liked some people and the things they brought to the table. I really liked Bill Pullman and the way he played the child killer/speaker/whatever-you-wanna-add. The role was one a lot of people might not have wanted, but he tackled it really well. The pauses and inflections he added made a more believable character with ticks and issues, and the way he did the voice made him seem - creepy. Mekhi and Alexa made good agents, one a field agent and one a button pusher, with a lot of human elements. There were family issues, loves, hates, needs, and it was all understandable. Alexa as Ester was especially good when it came to issues dealing with her sister, because it added a human element to this tale that took it from something global to something one-on-one. Mekhi as Rex also worked on that level because of the chest wound and how he takes us into the story, and how it all ties Torchwood in. John Barrowman is exactly what I expect, sometimes moreso, and I love that about him as Captain Jack. Eve will always be integral to Torchwood as well because Gwen, and the portrayal of her, continues to add that human side to the immortal exploits of Jack.I cannot include everyone, and so many were good in this series.If I had to throw out a flaw, it might be the fact that the end came the way it did, in speed and in the what, compared to the way the event itself played out. One episode captured all the exploits of what happened and more, and I'm not sure that was giving it enough time. This is a minor issue, really, and I am glossing over it because I do not want to add in spoiler information.I like Torchwood, have for a while, and continued enjoying it with this. For fans of the series it is a change, but possibly a good one. Considering the huge changes to the cast, the killings, it is good to add in more people - if you didn't, you would have some real issues (unless you want a two person cast). Some might not like the America members of a ""team,"" might not like the location, or a few other ideas thrown out there. To know, try it out and see if you like it, possibly on Video on Demand. You can preview some series, this one currently, on a few sites, watching one whole episode.If you are not a fan or do not know Torchwood, you can still enjoy this as well. It leaves gaps, watching anything without background does, but this was made not only to continue but to connect people as well.I liked that, it helped me show it to my family who didn't know the show.4.5/5",5,The Day the Clock Stopped,1328745600,"02 9, 2012",2012,4571,"['Miracle', 'Day', 'when', 'dying', 'stops', 'more', 'watching', 'loved', 'ones', 'leave', 'more', 'having', 'say', 'goodbye.Sounds', 'great', 'huh', 'problem', 'suffering', ""n't"", 'go', 'away', 'ravages', 'age', 'disease', 'do', 'not', 'simply', 'vanish', 'simply', 'end', 'Hospitals', 'overcrowd', 'issues', 'food', 'become', 'abundant', 'world', 'overcrowds', 'top', 'issue', 'how', 'suffering', 'are', 'seen', 'classified', 'where', 'sick', 'go', 'how', 'treat', 'injuries', 'long-term', 'care', 'world', 'gone', 'mad', 'something', 'one', 'name', 'be', 'connected', 'Torchwood.Originally', 'appearing', 'Starz', 'series', 'was', 'American', 'outing', 'otherwise', 'British', 'forum', 'can', 'tell', 'lot', 'people', 'were', 'added', 'fray', 'agencies', 'added', 'chase', 'Now', 'have', 'FBI', 'involved', 'American', 'economy', 'coming', 'forefront', 'discussion', 'what', 'should', 'should', 'not', 'take', 'place', 'different', 'personally', 'liked', 'know', 'how', 'lot', 'others', 'might', 'not', 'different', 'required', 'Torchwood', 'be', 'imported', 'USA.As', 'far', 'story', 'liked', 'Miracle', 'Day', 'idea', 'huge', 'almost', 'too', 'big', 'really', 'made', 'nice', 'Many', 'episodes', 'were', 'filled', 'look', 'issue', 'moments', 'made', 'impact', 'viewer', 'caught', 'asking', 'questions', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'many', 'ideas', 'threw', 'out', 'went', 'basics', 'also', 'liked', 'idea', 'how', 'characters', 'worked', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'have', 'more', 'people', 'work', 'Torchwood', 'more', 'types', 'baddies', 'had', 'oddities', 'groups', 'what', 'believed', 'suffering', 'had', 'disposable', 'way', 'thought', 'seemed', 'more', 'impacting', 'showed', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'up', 'grabs', 'just', 'how', 'dangerous', 'could', 'be', 'also', 'liked', 'thing', 'being', 'hidden', 'when', 'people', 'hit', 'Category', '3', 'what', 'plan', 'was', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'season', 'shows', 'instead', 'special', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'seeing', 'out', 'said', 'was', 'good.As', 'far', 'actors', 'really', 'liked', 'people', 'things', 'brought', 'table', 'really', 'liked', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'way', 'played', 'child', 'killer/speaker/whatever-you-wanna-add', 'role', 'was', 'one', 'lot', 'people', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'wanted', 'tackled', 'really', 'well', 'pauses', 'inflections', 'added', 'made', 'more', 'believable', 'character', 'ticks', 'issues', 'way', 'did', 'voice', 'made', 'seem', 'creepy', 'Mekhi', 'Alexa', 'made', 'good', 'agents', 'one', 'field', 'agent', 'one', 'button', 'pusher', 'lot', 'human', 'elements', 'were', 'family', 'issues', 'loves', 'hates', 'needs', 'was', 'understandable', 'Alexa', 'Ester', 'was', 'especially', 'good', 'when', 'came', 'issues', 'dealing', 'sister', 'added', 'human', 'element', 'tale', 'took', 'something', 'global', 'something', 'one-on-one', 'Mekhi', 'Rex', 'also', 'worked', 'level', 'chest', 'wound', 'how', 'story', 'how', 'ties', 'Torchwood', 'John', 'Barrowman', 'exactly', 'what', 'expect', 'sometimes', 'moreso', 'love', 'about', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'Eve', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'integral', 'Torchwood', 'as', 'well', 'Gwen', 'portrayal', 'add', 'human', 'side', 'immortal', 'exploits', 'Jack.I', 'can', 'not', 'include', 'everyone', 'so', 'many', 'were', 'good', 'series.If', 'had', 'throw', 'out', 'flaw', 'might', 'be', 'fact', 'end', 'came', 'way', 'did', 'speed', 'what', 'compared', 'way', 'event', 'played', 'out', 'One', 'episode', 'captured', 'exploits', 'what', 'happened', 'more', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'giving', 'enough', 'time', 'minor', 'issue', 'really', 'am', 'glossing', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'add', 'spoiler', 'information.I', 'Torchwood', 'have', 'while', 'continued', 'enjoying', 'fans', 'series', 'change', 'possibly', 'good', 'one', 'Considering', 'huge', 'changes', 'cast', 'killings', 'good', 'add', 'more', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'would', 'have', 'real', 'issues', 'want', 'two', 'person', 'cast', 'might', 'not', 'like', 'America', 'members', 'team', 'might', 'not', 'location', 'few', 'other', 'ideas', 'thrown', 'out', 'there', 'know', 'try', 'out', 'see', 'like', 'possibly', 'Video', 'Demand', 'can', 'preview', 'series', 'one', 'currently', 'few', 'sites', 'watching', 'one', 'whole', 'episode.If', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'Torchwood', 'can', 'still', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well', 'gaps', 'watching', 'anything', 'background', 'was', 'made', 'not', 'only', 'continue', 'connect', 'people', 'well.I', 'liked', 'helped', 'show', 'family', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'show.4.5/5']",Torchwood Miracle Day anglais

1452254,A3DKZIGPQTJF2S,B005A5IAC0,Zombie Kermit,"[3, 5]","At the end of series 3, Children of Earth, I found myself wondering how the series could continue at this point. Once online, I saw the synopsis for the 4th series. The people of the world stop dying, and everyone has to face the consequences of a world without death. This concept really interested me. I was looking forward to the series, especially after the amazing Children of Earth, which I felt topped the first two series by a large margin.Was I disappointed in this series? A little. Not so much while watching it, but when it was all over, and I looked back on the series as a whole, I did feel a little let down. Not because the series was awful, but because it made the mistake of offering a lead up that would require a pay off that they couldn't possibly deliver.If I had watched the show on DVD/Blu-Ray to start with, as I did with the first three series, I doubt I would have felt as much disappointed. It would have been just another season for me. But because I was a relatively new fan, and this was my first time watching the show on a weekly basis, it was a lot easier to be disappointed. A major issue was that the series was twice as long as Children of Earth, and often felt like it dragged on way too much. I feel the show would have been better if done over 6 episodes, or even 8, but 10 was too much. Each week I was tuning in and feeling like I hadn't gotten a great deal more added to the story. I felt it was running out of time and not really revealing a great deal.As I got closer and closer to the end, I began to realize that with all the teasing and mystery and the like, the series would really need a truly great pay-off to make it a great series. Unfortunately, while the last episode was a good one, it didn't really offer any great reveals or surprises to the mysteries they were offering throughout the whole series.All complaining aside, the series had a lot going for it. Rex Matheson was a decent addition to the team (although the second new addition, Esther Drummond was fairly bland and forgettable). Bill Pullman's character Oswald Danes was despicably fun to watch. Of course established characters Jack and Gwen were great as always.The series, as Children of Earth before it, also showed a lot of the dark side to the human race... the despicable things we can do when in a corner. Some of the best moments in the series were spent looking at just what we are capable of. Also featured were some really fantastic moments of tension, which definitely pushed the quality of the series up a notch or two.In the end, I'm not sure if I can recommend this series. I got my share of enjoyment out of it, and I honestly feel that the experience would be improved by watching it marathon, rather than week by week as I did. Unlike many, the American association with the show didn't bother me too much. I feel it shifted often enough between locations for it not to be a big deal. I suppose any American involvement in a British show will be met with controversy, but I don't think it's anything to worry about here. A lot of people disagree, but that's how I feel.I guess all I can say is, if you're a fan of Torchwood, nothing I say should be able to persuade you one way or the other. The only thing you can do is watch it and make up your own mind about it.",3,"Not Quite a Miracle, but far from a Disaster",1333411200,"04 3, 2012",2012,3303,"['end', 'series', '3', 'Children', 'Earth', 'found', 'wondering', 'how', 'series', 'could', 'continue', 'point', 'Once', 'online', 'saw', 'synopsis', '4th', 'series', 'people', 'world', 'stop', 'dying', 'everyone', 'face', 'consequences', 'world', 'death', 'concept', 'really', 'interested', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'series', 'especially', 'amazing', 'Children', 'Earth', 'felt', 'topped', 'first', 'two', 'series', 'large', 'margin.Was', 'disappointed', 'series', 'little', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'watching', 'when', 'was', 'looked', 'back', 'series', 'whole', 'did', 'feel', 'little', 'let', 'down', 'Not', 'series', 'was', 'awful', 'made', 'mistake', 'offering', 'lead', 'up', 'would', 'require', 'pay', 'off', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'deliver.If', 'had', 'watched', 'show', 'DVD/Blu-Ray', 'start', 'did', 'first', 'three', 'series', 'doubt', 'would', 'have', 'felt', 'much', 'disappointed', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'season', 'was', 'relatively', 'new', 'fan', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'watching', 'show', 'weekly', 'basis', 'was', 'lot', 'easier', 'be', 'disappointed', 'major', 'issue', 'was', 'series', 'was', 'twice', 'as', 'long', 'Children', 'Earth', 'often', 'felt', 'dragged', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'feel', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'done', '6', 'episodes', 'even', '8', '10', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'week', 'was', 'tuning', 'feeling', 'had', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'added', 'story', 'felt', 'was', 'running', 'time', 'not', 'really', 'revealing', 'great', 'deal.As', 'got', 'closer', 'closer', 'end', 'began', 'realize', 'teasing', 'mystery', 'like', 'series', 'would', 'really', 'need', 'truly', 'great', 'pay-off', 'make', 'great', 'series', 'Unfortunately', 'last', 'episode', 'was', 'good', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'offer', 'great', 'reveals', 'surprises', 'mysteries', 'were', 'offering', 'whole', 'series.All', 'complaining', 'aside', 'series', 'had', 'lot', 'going', 'Rex', 'Matheson', 'was', 'decent', 'addition', 'team', 'second', 'new', 'addition', 'Esther', 'Drummond', 'was', 'fairly', 'bland', 'forgettable', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'character', 'Oswald', 'Danes', 'was', 'despicably', 'fun', 'watch', 'course', 'established', 'characters', 'Jack', 'Gwen', 'were', 'great', 'always.The', 'series', 'Children', 'Earth', 'also', 'showed', 'lot', 'dark', 'side', 'human', 'race', 'despicable', 'things', 'can', 'do', 'when', 'corner', 'best', 'moments', 'series', 'were', 'spent', 'looking', 'just', 'what', 'are', 'capable', 'Also', 'featured', 'were', 'really', 'fantastic', 'moments', 'tension', 'definitely', 'pushed', 'quality', 'series', 'up', 'notch', 'two.In', 'end', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'can', 'recommend', 'series', 'got', 'share', 'enjoyment', 'honestly', 'feel', 'experience', 'would', 'be', 'improved', 'watching', 'marathon', 'rather', 'week', 'week', 'did', 'Unlike', 'many', 'American', 'association', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'too', 'much', 'feel', 'shifted', 'often', 'enough', 'locations', 'not', 'be', 'big', 'deal', 'suppose', 'American', 'involvement', 'British', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'met', 'controversy', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'worry', 'here', 'lot', 'people', 'disagree', 'how', 'feel.I', 'guess', 'can', 'say', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Torchwood', 'nothing', 'say', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'persuade', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'do', 'watch', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind']",Torchwood Miracle Day anglais
