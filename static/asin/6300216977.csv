223632,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,6300216977,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[4, 6]","""Ordinary People"" is a great movie classic.  It develops the story beautifully with both subtley and directness through scenes that crescendo to a powerful climax and conclusion.  The acting is marvelous; the directing and editing are masterful; and the story (derived from a Judith Guest novel, worthy of reading separately before or after viewing the movie) is an emotional gold mine.The story involves a respectable, but dysfunctional upper-middle class suburban Chicago family, the Jarretts, who are recovering from the aftermath of their eldest son's death.  Conrad (Timothy Hutton) recovered from the same boating accident that killed Buck, his brother.  He has to work out the results of that accident and still is surviving emotionally after the storm's wake, including a suicide attempt and a stay in a mental hospital.  Ordinary living has become nearly unbearable for him, but he has the support of a loving, but helpless father, Calvin (Donald Sutherland) and a lack of support from a selfish and uncaring mother, Beth (Mary Tyler Moore).  Conrad finds himself adrift until he heeds his father's advice to seek help from a psychiatrist, Dr. Burger (Judd Hirsch).""Ordinary People"" provides a symphonic build-up of emotions and revelations that are interesting and cathartic.  The performances are sensational.  Timothy Hutton justifiably won best supporting actor for the anguish, understated and boiling over, he created as Conrad.  Mary Tyler Moore has the performance of her lifetime, and Donald Sutherland, never nominated, shows ingenious subtlety as the father.  Judd Hirsch and M. Emmit Walsh are also excellent, as well as some of the natural performances by the other supporting actors.  Robert Redford has his directorial debut, which garnered him best director Oscar.""Ordinary People"" is either loved or hated.  Some criticize the movie as mere melodrama, but it is so well crafted, it is hard to reconcile, except to say that you need to be reasonably sensitive to appreciate this movie and how it unfolds.  There is still resentment regarding their Oscar sweep of this movie.  ""Raging Bull,"" another Best Picture nominee, is another worthy classic, but a different sort of film.  ""Ordinary People"" is a one of a kind movie made with a sensitivity and brilliance that few films ever accomplish.",5,Extraordinary Classic,1148601600,"05 26, 2006",2006,2317,"['Ordinary', 'People', 'great', 'movie', 'classic', 'story', 'beautifully', 'subtley', 'directness', 'scenes', 'crescendo', 'powerful', 'climax', 'conclusion', 'acting', 'marvelous', 'directing', 'editing', 'are', 'masterful', 'story', 'derived', 'Judith', 'Guest', 'novel', 'worthy', 'reading', 'separately', 'viewing', 'movie', 'emotional', 'gold', 'mine.The', 'story', 'respectable', 'dysfunctional', 'upper-middle', 'class', 'suburban', 'Chicago', 'family', 'Jarretts', 'who', 'are', 'recovering', 'aftermath', 'eldest', 'son', 'death', 'Conrad', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'recovered', 'same', 'boating', 'accident', 'killed', 'Buck', 'brother', 'work', 'out', 'results', 'accident', 'still', 'surviving', 'emotionally', 'storm', 'wake', 'including', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'stay', 'mental', 'hospital', 'Ordinary', 'living', 'become', 'nearly', 'unbearable', 'support', 'loving', 'helpless', 'father', 'Calvin', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'lack', 'support', 'selfish', 'uncaring', 'mother', 'Beth', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Conrad', 'adrift', 'father', 'advice', 'seek', 'help', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'Burger', 'Judd', 'Hirsch', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'symphonic', 'build-up', 'emotions', 'revelations', 'are', 'interesting', 'cathartic', 'performances', 'are', 'sensational', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'justifiably', 'won', 'best', 'supporting', 'actor', 'anguish', 'understated', 'boiling', 'over', 'created', 'Conrad', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'never', 'nominated', 'ingenious', 'subtlety', 'father', 'Judd', 'Hirsch', 'M.', 'Emmit', 'Walsh', 'are', 'also', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'natural', 'performances', 'other', 'supporting', 'actors', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'directorial', 'debut', 'garnered', 'best', 'director', 'Oscar', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'loved', 'hated', 'criticize', 'movie', 'mere', 'melodrama', 'so', 'well', 'crafted', 'hard', 'reconcile', 'say', 'need', 'be', 'reasonably', 'sensitive', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'how', 'still', 'resentment', 'regarding', 'Oscar', 'sweep', 'movie', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'Best', 'Picture', 'nominee', 'worthy', 'classic', 'different', 'sort', 'film', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'one', 'kind', 'movie', 'made', 'sensitivity', 'brilliance', 'few', 'films', 'ever', 'accomplish']",Ordinary People VHS
223633,A33L7G4E8CID3,6300216977,"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19""","[25, 25]","(... This movie) won a Best Picture Oscar, so I figured it would be good. I had no idea. Ordinary People is an astonishing movie where nothing is as it seems. The title itself is ironic, because although the Jared family seems like your typical American family, they are by no means so. Mary Tyler Moore plays Beth, the emotionally retentive mother who would rather not face the unseen demons that are rapidly tearing their family apart. Her performance captures the inner coldness and turmoil that is necessary to the character. Donald Sutherland is also excellent as Calvin, the sociable father who feels somewhat responsible for the problems of the family and wants healing. The regret and sadness of his character shine through, what an excellent job. Judd Hirsch is Dr. Berger, the psychiatrist who helps the family try to heal. But the movie is stolen by Timothy Hutton, who plays the young son Conrad, who had previously attempted suicide. His portrayal of the anguished, emotionally dead Conrad is a virtuoso performance. Eventually, through the help of Dr. Berger, Conrad is able to stop blaming himself for the death of his brother and move on with his life. Perhaps the most tension-filled scene in the movie for me was when Conrad found out that his friend had committed suicide and he goes into the bathroom and turns on the warm water and we see the scars on his wrists, and we can only wait to see if he is going to try it again. Another thing, brilliant direction by Robert Redford. Instead of using indulgent film shots or camera tricks, he just allows the camera to focus on the action, the right approach, even though he might have been tempted to try that kind of thing to prove himself in his first film. This is a great movie, one of the best ever made. Make it the next one you see. However, the DVD version is a little plain (...).",5,An amazing film,1006819200,"11 27, 2001",2001,1855,"['movie', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'figured', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'had', 'idea', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'astonishing', 'movie', 'where', 'nothing', 'title', 'ironic', 'Jared', 'family', 'typical', 'American', 'family', 'are', 'means', 'so', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Beth', 'emotionally', 'retentive', 'mother', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'not', 'face', 'unseen', 'demons', 'are', 'rapidly', 'tearing', 'family', 'apart', 'performance', 'inner', 'coldness', 'turmoil', 'necessary', 'character', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'also', 'excellent', 'Calvin', 'sociable', 'father', 'who', 'somewhat', 'responsible', 'problems', 'family', 'healing', 'regret', 'sadness', 'character', 'shine', 'what', 'excellent', 'job', 'Judd', 'Hirsch', 'Dr.', 'Berger', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'family', 'try', 'heal', 'movie', 'stolen', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'who', 'young', 'son', 'Conrad', 'who', 'had', 'previously', 'attempted', 'suicide', 'portrayal', 'anguished', 'emotionally', 'dead', 'Conrad', 'virtuoso', 'performance', 'Eventually', 'help', 'Dr.', 'Berger', 'Conrad', 'able', 'stop', 'blaming', 'death', 'brother', 'move', 'life', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'tension-filled', 'scene', 'movie', 'was', 'when', 'Conrad', 'found', 'out', 'friend', 'had', 'committed', 'suicide', 'bathroom', 'warm', 'water', 'see', 'scars', 'wrists', 'can', 'only', 'wait', 'see', 'going', 'try', 'again', 'thing', 'brilliant', 'direction', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Instead', 'using', 'indulgent', 'film', 'shots', 'camera', 'tricks', 'just', 'camera', 'focus', 'action', 'right', 'approach', 'even', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'tempted', 'try', 'kind', 'thing', 'prove', 'first', 'film', 'great', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'made', 'Make', 'next', 'one', 'see', 'However', 'DVD', 'version', 'little', 'plain']",Ordinary People VHS

223638,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6300216977,Austin Somlo,"[0, 3]","Viewed: 3/06, 2/14Rate: 63/06: Very engrossing and encompassing film, I wanted to see Ordinary People to find out how it managed to win the Best Picture of 1980 over Raging Bull. Needless to say, Raging Bull is much more of a masterpiece. Ordinary People is a very worthy film because of the outstanding performances by Donald Sutherland, Mary Tyler Moore, and Timothy Hutton. The direction is just right, and the story is very deliberate in the removal of its layers. The core keeps getting closer and closer as the layers are slowly removed. Finally, the ending, although I rightfully predicted the outcome, is extremely satisfying. Completely well-done is the direction by Robert Redford. I enjoyed the film, if not so thoroughly, but more in an appreciative way.2/14: In so many ways, Ordinary People is a made-for-TV picture with a theme of the week: rich people's problems. Naturally enough, it's not compelling enough for me to care. I have a hard time swallowing the fact that Donald Sutherland's character didn't see the dysfunction after being together with his wife for over 21 years. The real villain of the show is the mother, played by Mary Tyler Moore. It is so apparent from the get go that she is the scourge of the family, making it hard for the son to accept what has happened and move on. Quite literally, I was waiting for the acknowledgment to come, and it finally did but much too late. Mary did a wonderful job, alternating between clubbability and detachment she carried with her friends/relatives and her son respectively. With Hutton, it's almost as if she hadn't met him before on the set. Quite a friction, is it? Ordinary People is a long film to get to there, and the only thing I am just so surprised about the film is that it beat out Raging Bull for the Best Picture. Timothy Hutton is corny as he can be. All in all, Ordinary People is somewhat of an overrated film, but I enjoyed Donald Sutherland's performance with an even-keeled direction by Robert Redford.",3,"Obviously, Ordinary People Think It's Better Than Raging Bull.",1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,1996,"['Viewed', '3/06', '2/14Rate', '63/06', 'Very', 'engrossing', 'encompassing', 'film', 'wanted', 'see', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'managed', 'win', 'Best', 'Picture', '1980', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'Needless', 'say', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'much', 'more', 'masterpiece', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'very', 'worthy', 'film', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'direction', 'just', 'right', 'story', 'very', 'deliberate', 'removal', 'layers', 'core', 'getting', 'closer', 'closer', 'layers', 'are', 'slowly', 'removed', 'Finally', 'ending', 'rightfully', 'predicted', 'outcome', 'extremely', 'satisfying', 'Completely', 'well-done', 'direction', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'more', 'appreciative', 'way.2/14', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'made-for-TV', 'picture', 'theme', 'week', 'rich', 'people', 'problems', 'Naturally', 'enough', 'not', 'compelling', 'enough', 'care', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'swallowing', 'fact', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'dysfunction', 'being', 'together', 'wife', '21', 'years', 'real', 'villain', 'show', 'mother', 'played', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'so', 'apparent', 'get', 'go', 'scourge', 'family', 'making', 'hard', 'son', 'accept', 'what', 'happened', 'move', 'Quite', 'literally', 'was', 'waiting', 'acknowledgment', 'come', 'finally', 'did', 'much', 'too', 'late', 'Mary', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'alternating', 'clubbability', 'detachment', 'carried', 'friends/relatives', 'son', 'respectively', 'Hutton', 'almost', 'had', ""n't"", 'met', 'set', 'friction', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'long', 'film', 'get', 'there', 'only', 'thing', 'am', 'just', 'so', 'surprised', 'film', 'beat', 'out', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'corny', 'can', 'be', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'somewhat', 'overrated', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'performance', 'even-keeled', 'direction', 'Robert', 'Redford']",Ordinary People VHS
223639,AG0TA24LI0XV7,6300216977,"Baron Sardonicus, Super Genius","[5, 7]","Every family isn't perfect, and has its issues. Some families have scars and pain that threaten to destroy them, like the family in this film: three ordinary people.I had never seen Ordinary People until recently. I was a teen when it appeared in movie theaters. The film got Academy Awards for Director (Robert Redford, his first directing venture), Adapted Screenplay (Alvin Sargent), and Supporting Actor (Timothy Hutton). Mary Tyler Moore was nominated as Best Actress for her very solid performance as the complex and flawed Beth Jarrett. Judd Hirsch got a nod for Supporting Actor.What strikes me about this film is that it is brimming over with tension.Wife and mother Beth maintains her well adjusted appearance at all costs, even if it means alienating her immediate family. She has swept her pain and grief under the rug. Wound up very tightly like a perfect bow on a gift, she is chiefly concerned with keeping up appearances and a life that seems normal and content. She shuns the truth and emotions. Vacations and golf help her stay numb and distracted. Her husband Calvin knows that things are not right, but will not admit it to himself. He is in denial about his family, and about how he truly feels.The film's core is teenaged son Conrad; he is eaten up by his massive guilt over a family tragedy. Normally it should be the best time of his life. But he is a walking open sore, a raw nerve. Beth and Conrad are both repressed in many ways. She keeps a frosty distance from him, not even showing her child affection of any kind. He loses the friendship of his best buddy in school because of his angst and antisocial tendencies. Ironically, a good friend is the one thing that Conrad desperately needs at the moment, although he doesn't realize it. He refuses to reach out to others to help him endure the immense pain and conflict. There is heavy dysfunction in this family.Every performance is exceptional among the four main characters. But I believe the most interesting has to be Mary Tyler Moore's role. It is not easy to convey what her character is about. She has to walk a thin line between mother and monster. This is not a big, showy role. Far from it. There are so many subtle qualities and nuances to the character. Everything Moore does is spot on: body language, posture, expressions. It must have been a real challenge for this actress, after years of playing perky Mary Richards in a sitcom on TV. She really showed her acting chops here in Ordinary People.I must confess that throughout this film I felt a growing hatred for the character of Beth. But then I realize that she has gone through hell and just doesn't know how to cope any longer. She is a sad soul, and the worst part is that her life seems so normal from the outside... but inside she has died a bit. And it's damage that can't be undone.This is such a simple movie but it is so powerful. It's a very realistic portrayal of a family that's crumbling. If you like good drama and haven't seen this, it's well worth viewing.",4,Extraordinary Performances,1208131200,"04 14, 2008",2008,3020,"['family', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'issues', 'families', 'have', 'scars', 'pain', 'destroy', 'family', 'film', 'three', 'ordinary', 'people.I', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'recently', 'was', 'teen', 'when', 'appeared', 'movie', 'theaters', 'film', 'got', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Director', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'first', 'directing', 'venture', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay', 'Alvin', 'Sargent', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actress', 'very', 'solid', 'performance', 'complex', 'flawed', 'Beth', 'Jarrett', 'Judd', 'Hirsch', 'got', 'nod', 'Supporting', 'Actor.What', 'film', 'brimming', 'tension.Wife', 'mother', 'Beth', 'well', 'adjusted', 'appearance', 'costs', 'even', 'alienating', 'immediate', 'family', 'swept', 'pain', 'grief', 'rug', 'Wound', 'up', 'very', 'tightly', 'perfect', 'bow', 'gift', 'chiefly', 'concerned', 'keeping', 'up', 'appearances', 'life', 'normal', 'content', 'shuns', 'truth', 'emotions', 'Vacations', 'golf', 'help', 'stay', 'numb', 'distracted', 'husband', 'Calvin', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'right', 'will', 'not', 'admit', 'denial', 'family', 'how', 'truly', 'feels.The', 'film', 'core', 'teenaged', 'son', 'Conrad', 'eaten', 'up', 'massive', 'guilt', 'family', 'tragedy', 'Normally', 'should', 'be', 'best', 'time', 'life', 'walking', 'open', 'sore', 'raw', 'nerve', 'Beth', 'Conrad', 'are', 'repressed', 'many', 'ways', 'frosty', 'distance', 'not', 'even', 'showing', 'child', 'affection', 'kind', 'friendship', 'best', 'buddy', 'school', 'angst', 'antisocial', 'tendencies', 'Ironically', 'good', 'friend', 'one', 'thing', 'Conrad', 'desperately', 'moment', ""n't"", 'realize', 'reach', 'out', 'others', 'help', 'endure', 'immense', 'pain', 'conflict', 'heavy', 'dysfunction', 'family.Every', 'performance', 'exceptional', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'believe', 'most', 'interesting', 'be', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'role', 'not', 'easy', 'convey', 'what', 'character', 'walk', 'thin', 'line', 'mother', 'monster', 'not', 'big', 'showy', 'role', 'Far', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'subtle', 'qualities', 'nuances', 'character', 'Everything', 'Moore', 'spot', 'body', 'language', 'posture', 'expressions', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'real', 'challenge', 'actress', 'years', 'playing', 'perky', 'Mary', 'Richards', 'sitcom', 'TV', 'really', 'showed', 'acting', 'chops', 'here', 'Ordinary', 'People.I', 'must', 'confess', 'film', 'felt', 'growing', 'hatred', 'character', 'Beth', 'then', 'realize', 'gone', 'hell', 'just', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'cope', 'longer', 'sad', 'soul', 'worst', 'part', 'life', 'so', 'normal', 'outside', 'died', 'bit', 'damage', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'undone.This', 'such', 'simple', 'movie', 'so', 'powerful', 'very', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'family', 'crumbling', 'like', 'good', 'drama', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'well', 'worth', 'viewing']",Ordinary People VHS

223647,A23MZ5EULW2GHH,6300216977,"C. Heinrich ""wsidechris""","[155, 158]","I have seen ""Ordinary People"" at least a dozen times over the past 17 years. I was 15 when I first saw it. It is one of a small handful of films that I have turned back to over the years as I've grown for new insight and meaning with profound results (others include ""Midnight Cowboy"" and ""Taxi Driver""). Each and every time I see this, I see something new and am still deeply affected.People and critics throw out the phrase ""works on so many levels"".  This is an ideal film to model that nebulous concept. You could ask 50 people to screen it and ask them what they think it is about, and you would get 50 different responses. You could ask those same 50 people to screen it again in 5 years, and then ask them what they think it's about. You would get 50 different responses again. And so on and so on. You would get ""it's about suicide"", ""it's about [someone] that dies"", ""it's about a family tragedy"", ""it's about teen depression"", ""it's about a cold mother"", ""it's about a dysfunctional family"", and on and on. These are all true (and then some) so it's nearly impossible to describe this film in a nutshell.""Ordinary People"" (the movie and the great book from which it was adapted) shows us how families can go on for years and years (and even generations) without ever realizing or having to assess how everyone feels about one another. Some families get away with it, for things run smoothly on the surface. But sometimes things happen to shatter that facade. Could be an illness, a drug problem, a divorce, a death, whatever. Sometimes something so terrible happens that a family is forced to face each other and speak the unspoken. But sometimes, the unspoken simply cannot be spoken, at least by some of the members.That is the case with this family. The mother is so empty and emotionally sterile that it is clear she had never been a true part of that family. At least outside of her first child. ...The father struggled with his feelings, and wanted to share them, but probably felt unable to with such a cold, heartless matriarch in the family. And the... son didn't know what... he wanted, and was caught somewhere between his mother's sterility and his father's earnestness. He was always trying to please both, never realizing that it would never happen with his mother. At least until [something happened], for which the guilt mounted and mounted (with little help from his parents to relieve).Watching these three characters (well, two, really, for the mother is emotionally arrested) cope with this tragedy and assess their positions in the family unit is so compelling and so wrenching that it's almost voyeuristic. Robert Redford's direction really does feel like we're peeking into the windows of a family that we ""know"" down the block. Little did we know (or did they) what was really going on.This is a somber movie; it is not a simple TV movie-of-the-week. It shows that serious pain must be endured before pleasure can be found/regained. You can't sweep anything under the rug. And honesty is a must in any family or relationship; communication is vital to its survival. There's no way around it. Sometimes the communication will lead you to the worst conclusion--that you simply cannot get along--but the truth always prevails.  Because only in truth can you even try to change/understand/improve things.Technically speaking, this is superbly crafted. The acting is brilliant, the direction is penetrating, the dialogue ranges from exuberant to shattering, and everything else is perfect. I've seen a lot of movies, and it still amazes me that one of the most grueling, heart-wrenching pieces of acting I have ever seen was by young Timothy Hutton. The sight of his face and the sound of his voice will tear you apart. To me, that young actor carried the bulk of this heavyweight picture. He is nothing short of brilliant here. Donald Sutherland, definitely a great actor, hasn't been any better than this. To me, he is the ultimate portrait of the honest man struggling with his confusing role as a father and husband. And Mary Tyler Moore, of course, is frighteningly intense as the mother; it's impossible to link this woman to Mary Richards. Great support from everyone else, including the wonderful Elizabeth McGovern (with a character that receives much more development in the novel), and Judd Hirsch as the boy's psychiatrist (their scenese together are brilliant).I can't stress this film's importance enough. It demands multiple viewings. It is a shining example of how much insight film (and art in general) can shed on our lives if handled with care, taste, and realism. It covers ground that is universal to us all, regardless of family background. Don't cheat yourself out of a profoundly moving experience. And it just might change your life.

As family matriach Beth Jarrett, Mary Tyler Moore earned a Best Actress Oscar nomination and plays her character with what, at first, may come off as emotional distance and viciousness when, actually, she is essentially a weak person unable to handle anything less than perfection. As surviving son Conrad, Tim Hutton was a Best Supporting Actor statue for his protrayal of the emotionally shattered little brother dealing with his own guilt for having lived and his fight to be accepted by his mother. And as family man Cal Jarrett, Donald Sutherland is powerfully moving as the father who sees but cannot fend off the disintegration of his family. Robert Redford, in his directoral debut, won a Best Director Oscar, and justly so.

223650,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,6300216977,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[6, 6]","'Ordinary People' is one of those films that everyone can appreciate.  Even if one has never been in this exact situation we have all still in one way or another felt the pain this family feels.  Regardless of whether you feel 'Ordinary People' to be the best film of 80 or the film that stole the crown you really can't escape the weight a film like this carries.  In the heartfelt and heartbreaking performances that seem almost too real we all can find a piece of ourselves and that's what makes this a brilliant film.The film follows Beth and Calvin as they mourn the death of their eldest son Buck who died in a boating accident.  Their youngest son Conrad is almost left in the cold, feeling blamed for the death not by just his parents but by himself.  Because of this guilt, because of this pain he tries to end his life, and if it weren't for his fathers intervention he may have been successful.  The film shows the growing animosity Beth has for her son, almost as if she wished he had drown and not her dear Buck.  There's one scene in particular that really struck me, when Beth's parents were over and they wanted a picture of Conrad with his mother.  The tension in her voice as she pleaded with them not to take their picture, it's heartbreaking.Mary Tyler Moore's performance to me was the standout, far cry from her sitcom days.  She showed every ounce of sincerity in what she was saying; how she was acting that an image of her tossing her hat into the air never once crossed my mind.  She became Beth.  Donald Sutherland is also a great actor, but his character being the quiet husband comes across background to the mother and the son which serve as the true body of the film.  Calvin is the heart, but the heart is rarely seen.  Timothy Hutton did brilliantly as Conrad, a boy so beat down by his guilt and so distraught over his mothers distaste for him that he can't function right.  Judd Hirsch plays the psychiatrist Conrad is sent to that befriends him and helps him come to grips with his real feelings.Between Redford's amazing directing debut and Alvin Sargent wonderful adaptation of Judith Guest's novel of the same name you have a great movie waiting to happen, and when you add the powerful performances by everyone in the cast you get that great movie.

Russell ""syzygy121""","[7, 7]","The true strength of Redford's first work lies in his ability to give the actors the room to feel and the permission to breathe.  As an actor himself, I'm sure he knew how important it is to pull back as a director.All of the individual performances are superb, especially Moore, Hutton and Hirsch.  At times I fear the performances are too remote, too distant.  We get only glimpses of how things &quot;used to be&quot; in the Jarrett household.  I didn't find Beth and Connie's relationship as heartbreaking as I should have simply because I had little context for it or ability to compare it with life before Buck's death.  The distance now overwhelms any since of what has been lost.The film is truly frozen in the moment of their individual griefs.  These individuals move through their own journies of grief drawing closer and pulling back.I hate to suggest making a film longer, as doing so usually makes it more ponderous.  However, if we had been allowed to linger just a bit more in some of the flashbacks, I think the emotional impact would have been that much greater.

My friends and classmates have been scattered by our different clinical rotation assignments, divided up and swallowed whole into the innards of the WUMS hospitals.On this day, by chance, I run into Cynthia again.  She is the America's Sweetheart of our class.  It has been some time since I last saw or talked with Cyn.  I had met her on the very first day of medical school, and had asked her to be in my gross anatomy lab group.  For an entire year, we had talked, and traded jibes and jokes, and shared in the black humor and friendship needed to keep our sanity while dissecting our cadaver, studying six hours a day, and living in the confines of Olin Hall.I had a crush on Cyn, but so did half the male students in the class.  It turned out that we were very different, though, and we had gone our separate ways after the first year.And so with this chance encounter, we talk again at length, as old comrades, sharing in the emotional exhaustion of our two and a quarter year journey.  We have become transformed, since that first day of medical school, from carefree, high-spirited college graduates, giddy at having arrived in medical school, into serious, dour professionals....molded to become responsible and diligent and conformist proto-doctors, our faces creased with the beginnings of worry lines.Ordinary People is showing now, I mention casually to Cyn.  Do you want to go see it?  Yes! she says eagerly, and so off we go.  It is the only time I ever go out on a date with Cyn.I remember now, Cyn, that you let me pay for your movie ticket. I remember that you cried during the scene when Conrad recounted what happened on the sailboat, at the climax of the film.  I remember I looked at you with sympathy, and you were a bit embarrassed and said, ""Thanks for not making fun of me"".And that was the last time I remember talking to you at length, Cynthia.  Twenty months later, we would graduate, and two months after that I would get married.  And I have never seen you again.But I heard, Cynthia, that you became a psychiatrist, like Dr. Berger in the movie, and probably you are one heck of a great psychiatrist....",4,Did they really used to make movies like this?,1141948800,"03 10, 2006",2006,2313,"['came', 'movie', 'Amazon.com', 'one', 'day', 'wow', 'did', 'memories', 'come', 'pouring', 'back', '.It', 'fall', '1980', 'St.', 'Louis', 'Missouri', 'third', 'year', 'medical', 'school', 'friends', 'classmates', 'have', 'been', 'scattered', 'different', 'clinical', 'rotation', 'assignments', 'divided', 'up', 'swallowed', 'whole', 'innards', 'WUMS', 'hospitals.On', 'day', 'chance', 'run', 'Cynthia', 'again', 'America', 'Sweetheart', 'class', 'been', 'time', 'last', 'saw', 'talked', 'Cyn', 'had', 'met', 'very', 'first', 'day', 'medical', 'school', 'had', 'asked', 'be', 'gross', 'anatomy', 'lab', 'group', 'entire', 'year', 'had', 'talked', 'traded', 'jibes', 'jokes', 'shared', 'black', 'humor', 'friendship', 'needed', 'keep', 'sanity', 'dissecting', 'cadaver', 'studying', 'six', 'hours', 'day', 'living', 'confines', 'Olin', 'Hall.I', 'had', 'crush', 'Cyn', 'so', 'did', 'male', 'students', 'class', 'turned', 'out', 'were', 'very', 'different', 'though', 'had', 'gone', 'separate', 'ways', 'first', 'year.And', 'so', 'chance', 'encounter', 'talk', 'again', 'length', 'old', 'comrades', 'sharing', 'emotional', 'exhaustion', 'two', 'quarter', 'year', 'journey', 'have', 'become', 'transformed', 'first', 'day', 'medical', 'school', 'carefree', 'high-spirited', 'college', 'graduates', 'giddy', 'having', 'arrived', 'medical', 'school', 'serious', 'dour', 'professionals', '.molded', 'become', 'responsible', 'diligent', 'conformist', 'proto-doctors', 'creased', 'beginnings', 'worry', 'lines.Ordinary', 'People', 'showing', 'now', 'mention', 'casually', 'Cyn', 'Do', 'want', 'go', 'see', 'Yes', 'eagerly', 'so', 'go', 'only', 'time', 'ever', 'go', 'out', 'date', 'Cyn.I', 'remember', 'now', 'Cyn', 'let', 'pay', 'movie', 'ticket', 'remember', 'cried', 'scene', 'when', 'Conrad', 'recounted', 'what', 'happened', 'sailboat', 'climax', 'film', 'remember', 'looked', 'sympathy', 'were', 'bit', 'embarrassed', 'said', 'Thanks', 'not', 'making', 'fun', '.And', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'remember', 'talking', 'length', 'Cynthia', 'Twenty', 'months', 'later', 'would', 'graduate', 'two', 'months', 'would', 'get', 'married', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'again.But', 'heard', 'Cynthia', 'became', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'Berger', 'movie', 'probably', 'are', 'one', 'heck', 'great', 'psychiatrist']",Ordinary People VHS
223654,A1AUBGENRIZODO,6300216977,Dave Deubler,"[2, 2]","A very realistic look at how an ""ordinary"" suburban family is affected by a young man's accidental death.  Timothy Hutton stars as the neglected younger brother whose feelings of guilt have led him to a failed suicide attempt.  His recovery, and how he and his family attempt to return to some kind of normalcy, is the focus of the film.  His father (Donald Sutherland) tries to be understanding, but doesn't know how to help him, while his mother (played by Mary Tyler Moore) is distant and often antagonistic, unable to get beyond the loss of her beloved first-born; she just wants to get away from the son who she can't help but blame. Judd Hirsch is excellent as the psychiatrist who is helping our protagonist through his depression and isolation.This was Robert Redford's directorial debut, and every detail is just spot on.  The whole film is so powerful yet so convincing one can't help but be moved by it.  All of the actors are perfect in their roles (most of them were nominated for Oscars) and every shot is as natural as if we were sitting there with them.  In terms of plotting, most of the ""action"" has occurred before the film starts; we'll see enough to get the picture.  Rather than wallow in the physical horrors of a young man's death, Redford is trying to show how people deal with tragedy in their lives, or fail to, and how difficult it is for us ""ordinary people"" to talk about the things that really matter to us, even (especially) with the people we care most about.  A triumph of naturalism in filmmaking.All that said, this is a very somber film, which may not be everyone's cup of tea.  It addresses very serious issues in very serious ways, without the hyperbole that sometimes accompanies such efforts, but entertaining it's not.

It proves that such awful feelings toward oneself can strike those with the seemingly perfect life.  It explores the after-effects of a family once they lose a child, and once the other attempts suicide.  Robert Redford makes his Oscar winning directorial debut, leading the cast and crew to create a flawless, unforgettable masterpiece.Donald Sutherland and Mary Tyler Moore(Calvin and Beth Jerrad) play the lead roles as the supporting father and the selfish non-loving mother.  Their marriage is on the verge of divorce due to Beth's lack of support of their living son Conrad, played by Timothy Hutton.  Conrad faces guilt after losing his brother, Buck, in a boating accident a year ago.  His psychologist forces him to confront every life aspect.Every actor portrays their character delightfully, forcing every drop of emotion to the audience, even those with limited screentime.

His restrained direction ensures that the movie never descends into melodrama, and the big moments are superbly realised without the use of soaring strings or other Hollywood devices. Consequently, there is not a single moment that does not entirely ring true, and the movie is all the more heartwrenching for Redford's honest approach.He is helped by a uniformly excellent cast. From all accounts, Redford is (as you might expect) an actor's director, and here he draws superb performances from two actors in atypical roles. Donald Sutherland is deeply moving in the difficult role of the father unable to comprehend why his family is falling apart, and Mary Tyler Moore is equally good as his emotionally repressed wife. The latter's performance is all the braver when one recalls that Tyler Moore's role mirrored her own off-screen turmoil at that time. For like the character of Beth in the movie, she too had recently lost a son, and was struggling to come to terms with her loss.Judd Hirsch and Elizabeth McGovern are also impressive as, respectively, the psychiatrist and choirfriend who try to help Conrad, the troubled younger son of Tyler Moore and Sutherland. Conrad is played by 20-year-old Timothy Hutton in a mesmerising performance that will leave few viewers unaffected. Perfectly capturing the suicidal anguish of his character, Hutton rightly won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in this pivotal role. (Though why he was not nominated for Best Actor is beyond me; his is, after all, the central performance in the movie). Given the degree of Hutton's talent, one can only look in dismay at the downward spiral of his career in recent years.Ordinary People was one of the finest American movies of the 1980s, and its themes are as relevant today as they were two decades ago.

The acting by the entire cast is some of the finest in film history!  That may sound like a biased opinion, but considering the amount of honors bestowed on this film, I know I'm right.  What makes this film particularly remarkable is that, while it was made in 1980 and set in that time, watching it now it looks more like a period film than say, a film from a certain decade that has lost its vitality through the passing of time.  It is still fresh and vibrant, the connections that are made between the characters are as univeral as ever.

A pause.  A gesture.  A glance.  Nonverbal cues betray our true feelings and emotions; they amplify our thoughts.  Which is one of the major reasons (out of many) I so very much enjoy ORDINARY PEOPLE, Robert Redford's haunting, often disturbing film depicting family pain and dysfunction.  Although this film ushered in the Eighties--with its layered hairstyles and wacky threads--ORDINARY PEOPLE is completely and totally timeless; no matter what the period, people are people.  That's the simplistic beauty of this movie.All of us cope with tragedy in our own way--and when a tight-knit family of four loses a member (its firstborn son) to a boating accident, while the other son survives, the tragedy can become unbearable.  The grief.  The loss.  The pain.  The guilt.  Into this painful world the viewer is introduced to an affluent upper middle class family:  Calvin, Beth, and Conrad.  Conrad (Timothy Hutton), who watched his brother drown, has attempted suicide, misses his time spent in the hospital (a refuge from an insurmountable world), and only wants to find some inner peace and control to relieve his guilt.  Beth (Mary Tyler Moore) is a classic case of repression; bottling everything up inside, she puts on a Stepford-type facade and allows no one to penetrate the veneer--especially Conrad, who she blames for her other son's death.  Yet Calvin (Donald Sutherland) moves me the most as the grieving, compassionate father trying to hold his fragile family together.  His pain is immeasurable as he tries to help his son and come to grips about his loveless wife.

223663,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,6300216977,Doug Park,"[0, 0]","The first half of ORDINARY PEOPLE is uneventful, focusing mostly on the ""ordinary"" daily life of this Middle American family who, though they suffered a great tragedy in the death of their older son several years earlier and are now struggling with their younger son's depression and suicidal tendencies, seem otherwise like the Brady Bunch in their normality. {That being said, I'm not so sure the Brady Bunch were as quite as ""normal"" as their creators intended.} The first hour is so quiet and routine that it's easy to overlook the big, big conflicts going on beneath the surface, not just with the ""troubled"" surviving son but with the equally troubled ""ordinary"" parents. Though things intensify somewhat in the second half, this film may not appeal to many of today's audiences who want a lot of fast action, twists, and suspense. The acting is also rather wooden by modern standards, but I think that may have been intentional as all three members of the family are slowly, subtly revealed to be not so ""ordinary"" after all. Mary Tyler Moore gives a memorable performance as Beth the mother, a polite, apparently painfully everyday person who's entirely severed many basic connections with the human race. Calvin the father (Donald Sutherland) is the most wooden of all, but the way he's revealed to be the most neurotic in many ways, something realistically unfitting for a tax attorney, makes him convincing in the end. Likewise for younger son Conrad (Timothy Hutton), who appears to be such an everyday kid that it's easy to forget that he recently tried to ""off"" himself. The true heart and soul of this film, however, is Judd Hirsch as Berger the psychiatrist, a truly one-in-a-billion character.ORDINARY PEOPLE is a mass of contradictions. Not a lot of big events for a two-hour film, and some will inevitably find it just plain boring. Yet, more in the way of dramatic action (longer, more detailed flashbacks to the older son's drowning and Conrad's suicide attempt, etc) would somehow have detracted from it. The mood is consistently somber, like an unusually good soap opera, but there are some truly hilarious lines scattered in, and for today's audiences the 1980 styles (particularly Calvin's plaid golf trousers) will also provide some  comic relief. Some inconsistencies that still work because they fit the theme of the film so well: As Calvin puts it, ""I guess the whole of life is an accident."" ORDINARY PEOPLE often seems like a sort of 1980s After-School Special for Adults, with a number of too-easies, but even if it isn't entirely convincing, there's something nonetheless real about it in a way that can only be accomplished through fiction. The loaded dialogue is full of hackneyed pop psychology phrases, but despite, or even because of, the frequent corniness, ORDINARY PEOPLE succeeds at being truly touching.Disturbing subject matter and lots of realistic profanity, but nothing else (no sex/nudity or serious gore/violence) that really justifies the ""R"" rating.",4,"""You can't break anything in a bowling alley, and that is what I like about bowling alleys""",1397606400,"04 16, 2014",2014,3000,"['first', 'half', 'ORDINARY', 'PEOPLE', 'uneventful', 'focusing', 'mostly', 'ordinary', 'daily', 'life', 'Middle', 'American', 'family', 'who', 'suffered', 'great', 'tragedy', 'death', 'older', 'son', 'several', 'years', 'earlier', 'are', 'now', 'struggling', 'younger', 'son', 'depression', 'suicidal', 'tendencies', 'seem', 'otherwise', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'normality', 'being', 'said', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'were', 'as', 'quite', 'normal', 'creators', 'intended', 'first', 'hour', 'so', 'quiet', 'routine', 'easy', 'overlook', 'big', 'big', 'conflicts', 'going', 'surface', 'not', 'just', 'troubled', 'surviving', 'son', 'equally', 'troubled', 'ordinary', 'parents', 'things', 'intensify', 'somewhat', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'appeal', 'many', 'today', 'audiences', 'who', 'want', 'lot', 'fast', 'action', 'twists', 'suspense', 'acting', 'also', 'rather', 'wooden', 'modern', 'standards', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'intentional', 'three', 'members', 'family', 'are', 'slowly', 'subtly', 'revealed', 'be', 'not', 'ordinary', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'memorable', 'performance', 'Beth', 'mother', 'polite', 'apparently', 'painfully', 'everyday', 'person', 'who', 'entirely', 'severed', 'many', 'basic', 'connections', 'human', 'race', 'Calvin', 'father', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'most', 'wooden', 'way', 'revealed', 'be', 'most', 'neurotic', 'many', 'ways', 'something', 'realistically', 'unfitting', 'tax', 'attorney', 'convincing', 'end', 'Likewise', 'younger', 'son', 'Conrad', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'who', 'be', 'such', 'everyday', 'kid', 'easy', 'forget', 'recently', 'tried', 'off', 'true', 'heart', 'soul', 'film', 'however', 'Judd', 'Hirsch', 'Berger', 'psychiatrist', 'truly', 'one-in-a-billion', 'character.ORDINARY', 'PEOPLE', 'mass', 'contradictions', 'Not', 'lot', 'big', 'events', 'two-hour', 'film', 'will', 'inevitably', 'find', 'just', 'plain', 'boring', 'more', 'way', 'dramatic', 'action', 'longer', 'more', 'detailed', 'flashbacks', 'older', 'son', 'drowning', 'Conrad', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'etc', 'would', 'somehow', 'have', 'detracted', 'mood', 'consistently', 'somber', 'unusually', 'good', 'soap', 'opera', 'are', 'truly', 'hilarious', 'lines', 'scattered', 'today', 'audiences', '1980', 'styles', 'particularly', 'Calvin', 'plaid', 'golf', 'trousers', 'will', 'also', 'provide', 'comic', 'relief', 'inconsistencies', 'still', 'work', 'fit', 'theme', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'Calvin', 'guess', 'whole', 'life', 'accident', 'ORDINARY', 'PEOPLE', 'often', 'sort', '1980s', 'After-School', 'Special', 'Adults', 'number', 'too-easies', 'even', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'convincing', 'something', 'nonetheless', 'real', 'way', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'accomplished', 'fiction', 'loaded', 'dialogue', 'full', 'hackneyed', 'pop', 'psychology', 'phrases', 'even', 'frequent', 'corniness', 'ORDINARY', 'PEOPLE', 'being', 'truly', 'touching.Disturbing', 'subject', 'matter', 'lots', 'realistic', 'profanity', 'nothing', 'else', 'sex/nudity', 'serious', 'gore/violence', 'really', 'R', 'rating']",Ordinary People VHS

Donald Sutherland was also excellent as the  father who really wants to see his family kept together, and try to be  happy again after losing a loved one.

Being a fan of character study films, I thought I would have to check out ""Ordinary People"".""Ordinary People"" stars Mary Tyler Moore, Donald Sutherland, and Timothy Hutton as the Jarrett family. They had recently lost their older son Buck due to a tragic boating accident. The film focuses on the aftermath of Buck's death. Buck was the favorite son of Beth Jarrett (Mary Tyler Moore). After losing Buck, Beth finds it virtually impossible to show any kindness or affection to her younger son Conrad. In some way, she subconsciously blames Conrad for Buck's death. Donald Sutherland plays Calvin Jarrett, the father who tries to be there emotionally for his wife and son but does not know how to fix the huge gap between his wife and son.Since he is unable to find solace in comfort in his family, Conrad finds comfort in his sympathetic psychiatrist Dr. Tyrone C. Berger (Judd Hirsch). Timothy Hutton's scenes with Judd Hirsch were heartbreaking to say the very least, especially when Conrad is forced to confront the boating accident. You'll understand why Timothy Hutton won an Oscar for his performance.""Ordinary People"" did move a little slowly at times for me but overall the film was well crafted. The human dynamics between the members of the Jarrett family were realistic and emotionally moving.

There is no violence here, no F-bombs, no sex..just the secrets of an upper-class family coming apart amid cocktail parties and Christmas shopping at Neiman Marcus. Donald Sutherland and Mary Tyler Moore live in  a big house, have lots of well-to-do friends, and are mourning the loss of their oldest son and the near-suicide of their remaining son - played beautifully by Timothy Hutton. Wracked by Survivor's Guilt, Hutton's Conrad Jarrett tries without success to emulate his older brother and suffers endless disdain from his Mother, played like an iceberg by Moore, in a departure from her cheery sitcom personna. As Conrad begins to trust his new Doctor (Judd Hirsch), his finally starts dealing with his feelings. Sutherland is the sympathetic Father who tries to deal with his son's issues, only to discover a few of his own. This is powerful stuff - with great performances from a great ensemble cast. Director Robert Redford makes this seem so real - especially the performances of Hutton and Moore. Hutton is sweet, vunerable, and slightly annoying - he does angst beautifully. Oddly enough I found Moore as the most affecting: her dogged determination to ""keep up appearances""  results in an icy personna as she is happy to buy her son $75 shirts but can't show any affection to her son or her husband.

These movies especially grappled with dysfunctional families and the pains associated with domestic strife. Ordinary People differed specifically because of solid acting from the leading actors/actresses to the stellar supporting cast. It also marked the debut of Robert Redford as a director.The Jarrett's are your ""typical"" suburban family, but with a recent tragedy that has shaken the core of their structure. The eldest son, Buck was involved in an unfortunate accident that cost him his life. Marred with guilt from the accident, young Conrad Jarrett (Timothy Hutton) blames himself for the accident and attempts to take his own life. The movie centers on the bandage Conrad's mother Beth (Mary Tyler Moore) attempts to use to shield her family from sympathy and pity from the community. This defensive stance she takes unfortunately has created significant space between her and Conrad. It is Calvin Jarrett (Donald Sutherland) who is the man stuck in the middle of hostility between a dejected son and confused mother. Calvin's awakening towards the end of the movie proves to be the means of progress that the Jarrett's were in desperate need of.The acting from the main characters was superb. Sutherland and Moore both complimented each other very well. Their intimacy was believable and their emotional scenes were intense. The newcomer Timothy Hutton steals the movie though as the troubled younger brother in desperate need of emotional support and guidance.

His elder son has been awfully and touched by this significant loss and suffers serious deviations in his emotive behavior, blaming himself about it. Terrible revelations along the film will involve us from start to end. But there is still more, his mother is a human being unable to inspire love, transmit confidence and elicit human warmth. These emotive scarcities will surround his intimate and outer  world, creating an invisible but very defined frontier of self sufficiency isolating practically of all those who esteem and love her.From the times of a Long day 's journey into the night, Guess who is coming to dinner, The last picture show and Kramer vs. Kramer we had not watched such kind of potent statement around a visible state of things that carved in relief with such crudeness and realism such familiar portrait.Timothy Hutton got his best achievement in his career. But the honors also go to Mary Tyler Moore featuring the role of this obsessive and emotionally invalid mother; Donald Sutherland made a very vibrant acting as the wounded father who is stood in the middle of the tragedy. He represents the tolerance and the equilibrium trying to deal against the painful circumstances and making the best he can to avoid the unavoidable collapseRobert Redford will be always remembered by his notable contribution to the enriching of the cinematographic language.

But all actors in this film do justice to the fine script, photography and direction.  Basically it tells the story of the devastating effects loss can have on  what to all appearances is a model middle class American family. Ms Moore's  meticulous dedication to her house duties, her obsession about place  settings at dinner for example, reminds one of the mother in the film THE  DAY AFTER who goes upstairs to make the bed when she realises the world is  coming to an end -literally. It's a powerful moment, because the viewer is  reminded of mothers as the givers, the nurturers, the builders of family,  the ones who seem at the centre of civilised life. Thus the tragedy in  ORDINARY PEOPLE to me turns very much on Ms Moore's role as the mother.  Because she cannot come to terms with loss, her falling, her failures -  loving too much perhaps, caring too much for one son over the other - is  the tragedy wrought on the family unit.

223679,A14JEURPY1CXZB,6300216977,James D. Leverton,"[10, 11]","""Ordinary People"" (1980) is one of those rare classic films that has lost none of its power and remains relevant and fresh nearly 25 years after its original release.  Robert Redford's film debut, based on the modern classic novel by Judith Guest, packs the same powerful emotional punch on the tenth viewing it does on its first.The story is simple but deals with incredibly complex emotions that take its characters and the audience into some pretty dark places.  On first look, the Jarretts are an ordinary, upper-middle class family consisting of businessman father Calvin (Donald Sutherland), homemaker wife Beth (Mary Tyler Moore) and teenage son Conrad (Timothy Hutton).  But something is definitely wrong.  Conrad has trouble sleeping and has slash mark scars on his wrists.  Calvin seems overly concerned with his son's health, while Beth is obviously in serious denial about something.  Then there's the bedroom at the end of the hall that is filled with another, absent son's possessions--an older son named Buck, whom we gradually discover has recently died in a tragic accident in which Conrad had some part.  It's not until Conrad starts seeing a psychiatrist named Berger (Judd Hirsch) that the circumstances of the accident, and the fragile state of the Jarrett family's emotional health, starts to unravel.""Ordinary People"" is a perfect movie.  Not one scene, line of dialog, characterization or camera shot is out of place, wasted or unnecessary.  Redford directs with the sure hand of an old pro, and screenwriter Alvin Sargent (who recently wrote the superior script to ""Spiderman 2"") has accomplished something unthinkable:  he's actually written a script that improves on the original novel, which is pitch-perfect in its own right.  And the performances are phenomenal:  Hutton won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his brilliant turn as a suicidal teen simply crying out for his mother's love, while Moore deserved one (but lost out to Sissy Spacek's equally deserving work in ""Coal Miner's Daughter"") as a mother who buried her heart with her favorite son and cannot bring herself to give her surviving son the love he needs.  And Hirsch is a tower of strength as the understanding psychiatrist who forces Conrad to unlock the keys to his memory and understand why he has lost the will to live.  But the truly unsung hero is Sutherland, in an atypical role as a loving father who is supremely concerned about his son but simply can't crack through the surface of either wife or son to get to the root of the problem.  M. Emmett Walsh (as a swimming instructor), Frederic Lehne (as a concerned friend) and Elizabeth McGovern (as Conrad's potential girlfriend) add key support, while Dinah Manoff is simply a knockout in her one scene as Conrad's obviously unstable mental patient friend.But the real genius of the film is in the casting of Mary Tyler Moore as the coldest, and most hated, mother since Angela Lansbury in ""The Manchurian Candidate.""  That Redford saw this character in the actress who previously was best known as the bubbly heroine of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" has to rank as one of the riskiest, and ultimately most insightful, casting decisions in cinema history.  Mark my word, in a film filled with haunting imagery, you will never forget Moore's last scene, in which she pathetically struggles to maintain her composure when she realizes her whole world has come crashing down on her.""Ordinary People"" won the 1980 Best Picture Oscar, as well as awards for Hutton, Redford's direction and Sargeant's script.  Critics have maligned the choice for over two decades because it beat out Martin Scorsese's masterwork ""Raging Bull,"" which is admittedly an outstanding film.  Maybe this really is one of the all-time Oscar tragedies like many say.  But one thing is for sure.  ""Ordinary People"" is the rare film that has the power to not only change lives, but save them, too, if people take its message to heart.  ""Raging Bull"" is simply a vivid biopic of a heinous man.  I'll take the former any day.***** (out of *****), although the DVD is a typical bare-bones, extras-free (except for the original trailer and 1:85:1 widescreen format) Paramount package.

The story is primarily told through Hutton's character.It is a highly cathartic and moving film, particularly if you have ever lost a loved one to an accident. The scenes with Hutton and Hirsch are especially intense, as is the scene where Moore finally loses her extreme self control. Mary Tyler Moore is just amazing in that scene.Robert Redford's directing debut, I believe, and a darned fine one at that.

Because the truth that this film enlightens never goes away:many (99% with the other 1% still in denial!) American families keep up appearances due to whatever their social standing in the community might be.In this film's case,an older son (Timothy Hutton) has been trying to keep on going in his teen years after the death of his younger brother in a boating accident.He returns home to the ""perfect"" family,Mary Tyler Moore and Donald Sutherland who present the idyllic upper middle class image.But there is something eerie and icy about this homelife that can only be seen from the inside.Everyone is affected by it, but no one can or is willing or is yet able to articulate what the problem is! Timothy Hutton seeks out a therapist (a deadpan,right-on clinician-type  Judd Hirsch) who is the catalyst through which Hutton's character comes to full enlightenment about the worthless emotions of misplaced guilt.This enlightenment threatens the very thread bare fabric of this family, and the sparks start to fly in ways that still have yet to be captured on film with such nuance and accuracy.Only the films THE HANGING GARDEN and THE ICE STORM have even remotely approached the power of ORDINARY PEOPLE. This story is unparalleled IMO in the world of family dynamics.That this film was Movie of the Year still stands as a testament to the resilient direction and acting in this film... with no special effects,no car chases, no CGI...but rather the cream of the crop actors demonstrating their fine-honed craft and a then-young director with a vision to tell a story about ordinary people.If you need to take a look at your family dynamics,then it started here and still starts here...ORDINARY PEOPLE!",5,The revealing truth about ordinary ORDINARY PEOPLE,1195344000,"11 18, 2007",2007,2696,"['could', 'rate', 'film', '10', 'stars', 'then', 'would', 'so', 'will', 'who', 'stopping', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'directorial', 'debut', 'film', 'ORDINARY', 'PEOPLE', 'still', 'single', 'most', 'profound', 'revealing', 'family', 'full', 'secrets', 'must', 'keep', 'thin', 'veneer', 'cracking', 'exposing', 'truth', 'ordinary', 'people', 'friends', 'work', 'companions', 'may', 'be', 'living', 'guise', 'happiness', 'perfect', 'complete', 'tranquility', 'while', 'suffering', 'severely', 'secret', 'guilt', 'shame', 'having', 'where', 'turn', 'film', 'singlehandedly', 'opened', 'doors', 'personally', 'Summer', '1980', 'delving', 'perfect', 'family', 'past.I', 'can', 'credit', 'other', 'source', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'Judd', 'Hirsch', 'acted', 'expose', 'what', 'first', 'coined', 'term', 'dysfunctional', 'family', '-a', 'phrase', 'hitherto', 'was', 'not', 'known', 'become', 'household', 'staple', 'pun', 'intended', 'film', 'was', 'released.ORDINARY', 'PEOPLE', 'timeless', 'piece', 'art', 'will', 'never', 'go', 'fashion.Why', 'truth', 'film', 'never', 'away', 'many', '99', '%', 'other', '1', '%', 'still', 'denial', 'American', 'families', 'keep', 'up', 'appearances', 'due', 'whatever', 'social', 'standing', 'community', 'might', 'be.In', 'film', 'case', 'older', 'son', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'been', 'trying', 'keep', 'going', 'teen', 'years', 'death', 'younger', 'brother', 'boating', 'accident.He', 'home', 'perfect', 'family', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'who', 'present', 'idyllic', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'image.But', 'something', 'eerie', 'icy', 'homelife', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'seen', 'inside.Everyone', 'affected', 'one', 'can', 'willing', 'yet', 'able', 'articulate', 'what', 'problem', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'out', 'therapist', 'deadpan', 'right-on', 'clinician-type', 'Judd', 'Hirsch', 'who', 'catalyst', 'Hutton', 'character', 'full', 'enlightenment', 'worthless', 'emotions', 'misplaced', 'guilt.This', 'enlightenment', 'very', 'thread', 'bare', 'fabric', 'family', 'sparks', 'start', 'fly', 'ways', 'still', 'have', 'yet', 'be', 'captured', 'film', 'such', 'nuance', 'accuracy.Only', 'films', 'THE', 'HANGING', 'GARDEN', 'THE', 'ICE', 'STORM', 'have', 'even', 'remotely', 'approached', 'power', 'ORDINARY', 'PEOPLE', 'story', 'unparalleled', 'IMO', 'world', 'family', 'film', 'was', 'Movie', 'Year', 'still', 'testament', 'resilient', 'direction', 'acting', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'car', 'chases', 'CGI', 'rather', 'cream', 'crop', 'actors', 'demonstrating', 'fine-honed', 'craft', 'then-young', 'director', 'vision', 'tell', 'story', 'ordinary', 'people.If', 'need', 'take', 'look', 'family', 'dynamics', 'then', 'started', 'here', 'still', 'here', 'ORDINARY', 'PEOPLE']",Ordinary People VHS

223693,A136MAOWGCU2C2,6300216977,K.T. May,"[0, 0]","Ordinary People, (1980), is a four-time Oscar winning film that takes place in Chicago, IL and tells a tale that could be quite common in many a suburban household.  Donald Sutherland stars as Calvin, the father who tries desperately to keep his crumbling family together. Mary Tyler Moore plays Beth, the uptight mother who is subtley tearing the family apart--an about-face of a character for her.  Timothy Hutton steals the film as Conrad, the angst-ridden son who secretly believes he is responsible for his brother's death.  Judd Hirsch stars as Dr. Berger, the psychiatrist who Conrad seeks out for help in dealing with the family he cannot relate to and his past, which haunts him daily.Conrad's brother, Buck, is accidentally killed in a boating accident and because of this, Conrad attempts suicide and spends four months in the hospital afterwards.  This story picks up upon Conrad's arrival back home and focuses on his family's reception of him, (which isn't exactly satisfying), and Conrad's attempt to deal with his past while getting on with his future.  Beth is more focused on keeping her social calendar packed and avoiding judgments from others on her family than she is on actually keeping her family together.  Conrad assumes that she hates him and that Buck was the favorite and in watching her actions toward him, the audience can only side with him.  She is cold, uncaring and nothing means more to her than who she is having dinner with or where she can vacation for Christmas.  Calvin tries to show his son that he cares about him and that he only wants to help, but Conrad is averse to his attention and seeks solace in Dr. Berger.  Dr. Berger is one of the most likable characters in this film.  Psychologists and psychiatrists tend to be better characters in films because they shed light on the problems that are happening beneath the surface.  At one point, Conrad finds himself in a tense situation when a tragic event occurs and he realizes that the only way he can save himself is if he can contact Dr. Berger in time.  Elizabeth McGovern shines as cheerful Jeannine Pratt, the only person Conrad's age who he can possibly trust and who can maybe save him from himself.Timothy Hutton received an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in this film and it is clear that it was well-deserved.  Conrad is so riddled with angst and depression that he makes for a very believable character.  One can relate to certain scenes in the movie where Conrad feels like he has nowhere to turn, like the world has turned on him and he can't find peace no matter how he tries.  This movie was also Robert Redford's directorial debut and has been thoroughly praised for his direction on this film.  Four oscars aren't bad for a directorial debut!  The tagline for this film read, ""some films you watch, others you feel.""  This is quite the accurate statement since no matter what you feel, whether it's hatred for Beth's ambivalence, sympathy for Conrad's troubled mind, or satisfaction with Calvin's final decision, you will feel something for this movie when it's over.",4,Ordinary People is not your ordinary movie.,1247616000,"07 15, 2009",2009,3082,"['Ordinary', 'People', '1980', 'four-time', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'film', 'place', 'Chicago', 'IL', 'tale', 'could', 'be', 'quite', 'common', 'many', 'suburban', 'household', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Calvin', 'father', 'who', 'desperately', 'keep', 'crumbling', 'family', 'together', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Beth', 'uptight', 'mother', 'who', 'subtley', 'tearing', 'family', 'apart', 'about-face', 'character', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'film', 'Conrad', 'angst-ridden', 'son', 'who', 'secretly', 'responsible', 'brother', 'death', 'Judd', 'Hirsch', 'Dr.', 'Berger', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'Conrad', 'out', 'help', 'dealing', 'family', 'can', 'not', 'relate', 'past', 'daily.Conrad', 'brother', 'Buck', 'accidentally', 'killed', 'boating', 'accident', 'Conrad', 'suicide', 'four', 'months', 'hospital', 'afterwards', 'story', 'up', 'Conrad', 'arrival', 'back', 'home', 'focuses', 'family', 'reception', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'satisfying', 'Conrad', 'attempt', 'deal', 'past', 'getting', 'future', 'Beth', 'more', 'focused', 'keeping', 'social', 'calendar', 'packed', 'avoiding', 'judgments', 'others', 'family', 'actually', 'keeping', 'family', 'together', 'Conrad', 'Buck', 'was', 'favorite', 'watching', 'actions', 'audience', 'can', 'only', 'side', 'cold', 'uncaring', 'nothing', 'more', 'who', 'having', 'dinner', 'where', 'can', 'vacation', 'Christmas', 'Calvin', 'show', 'son', 'only', 'help', 'Conrad', 'averse', 'attention', 'solace', 'Dr.', 'Berger', 'Dr.', 'Berger', 'one', 'most', 'likable', 'characters', 'film', 'Psychologists', 'psychiatrists', 'tend', 'be', 'better', 'characters', 'films', 'shed', 'light', 'problems', 'are', 'happening', 'surface', 'one', 'point', 'Conrad', 'tense', 'situation', 'when', 'tragic', 'event', 'occurs', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'save', 'can', 'contact', 'Dr.', 'Berger', 'time', 'Elizabeth', 'McGovern', 'shines', 'cheerful', 'Jeannine', 'Pratt', 'only', 'person', 'Conrad', 'age', 'who', 'can', 'possibly', 'trust', 'who', 'can', 'maybe', 'save', 'himself.Timothy', 'Hutton', 'received', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'film', 'clear', 'was', 'well-deserved', 'Conrad', 'so', 'riddled', 'angst', 'depression', 'very', 'believable', 'character', 'One', 'can', 'relate', 'certain', 'scenes', 'movie', 'where', 'Conrad', 'nowhere', 'turn', 'world', 'turned', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'peace', 'matter', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'directorial', 'debut', 'been', 'thoroughly', 'praised', 'direction', 'film', 'Four', 'oscars', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'directorial', 'debut', 'tagline', 'film', 'read', 'films', 'watch', 'others', 'feel', 'quite', 'accurate', 'statement', 'matter', 'what', 'feel', 'hatred', 'Beth', 'ambivalence', 'sympathy', 'Conrad', 'troubled', 'mind', 'satisfaction', 'Calvin', 'final', 'decision', 'will', 'feel', 'something', 'movie', 'when', 'over']",Ordinary People VHS

The surviving son is played by Timothy Hutton who won a well-deserved Academy Award for this role.  He's magnificent. My heart went out to him from the first moment he's on the screen.Donald Sutherland plays his father with compassion and understanding.  Mary Tyler Moore is cast as the mother in a very unsympathetic role.  She can't seem to love this second son of hers, and doesn't even seem to try.  There is always a false smile on her face as she presents a picture of the perfect wife and mother to the world.  There's a coldness inside that just can't be reached.  She was so natural in this role that it seemed she is like this in real life.  But I guess that is what good acting is all about.

Rarely does a film surface that so brilliantly tackles repressed human emotion and family tension. The film is very character-driven, especially the roles of Timothy Hutton and Mary Tyler Moore. Hutton plays Conrad, the tormented, suicidal younger son who survived the boating accident that killed his older brother, Buck. Moore is Beth, the icy, anguished mother who cannot forgive her younger son for surviving when Buck, her favorite, perished. Donald Sutherland is Calvin, the father who desperately tries to reconcile his wife and son and promote healing in the family. Judd Hirsch plays Dr. Berger, the psychiatrist who helps Conrad come to terms with his parents, himself, and his dead brother. Most of the movie is viewed through Hutton's eyes, but we see each character try to cope with Buck's untimely and tragic death. I liked the fact that we discover the details about the accident in flashback pieces throughout the movie; it adds an element of suspense to the psychological study of the characters.Several scenes are especially moving and are permanently affixed to my memory: the photo-taking scene with the grandparents; the restaurant scene with Conrad and Karen; Conrad's first session with Dr. Berger; Conrad's breakthrough session with Dr. Berger; the scene where Conrad catches his mother reminiscing in Buck's room, and the two can't even carry on a conversation together; the scene when Moore finally loses her rigid self-control; and of course the final scene. Watch each of these scenes and you actually FEEL what each character feels. It's incredible; a testament to brilliant acting, writing, and directing.I believe that each of us can identify with some element of the tragic, dysfunctional family presented here, and perhaps that makes this film so timeless and exceptional. This movie isn't over-the-top (even though the social class of the Jarretts isn't exactly ""ordinary""). The film is impeccable. And here is what allows us to identify with this film, whether we've tragically lost a close family member or not: we all wish we were ""ordinary people,"" but like these characters, we all have deeper emotions and tragedies that threaten to break us.",5,"Impeccable acting, writing, and directing",1082937600,"04 26, 2004",2004,2288,"['recently', 'watched', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'emotionally', 'edge', 'entire', 'two', 'hours', 'Rarely', 'film', 'surface', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'tackles', 'repressed', 'human', 'emotion', 'family', 'tension', 'film', 'very', 'character-driven', 'especially', 'roles', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Hutton', 'Conrad', 'tormented', 'suicidal', 'younger', 'son', 'who', 'survived', 'boating', 'accident', 'killed', 'older', 'brother', 'Buck', 'Moore', 'Beth', 'icy', 'anguished', 'mother', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'forgive', 'younger', 'son', 'surviving', 'when', 'Buck', 'favorite', 'perished', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Calvin', 'father', 'who', 'desperately', 'reconcile', 'wife', 'son', 'promote', 'healing', 'family', 'Judd', 'Hirsch', 'Dr.', 'Berger', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'Conrad', 'come', 'terms', 'parents', 'dead', 'brother', 'Most', 'movie', 'viewed', 'Hutton', 'eyes', 'see', 'character', 'try', 'cope', 'Buck', 'untimely', 'tragic', 'death', 'liked', 'fact', 'discover', 'details', 'accident', 'flashback', 'pieces', 'movie', 'element', 'suspense', 'psychological', 'study', 'characters.Several', 'scenes', 'are', 'especially', 'moving', 'are', 'permanently', 'affixed', 'memory', 'photo-taking', 'scene', 'grandparents', 'restaurant', 'scene', 'Conrad', 'Karen', 'Conrad', 'first', 'session', 'Dr.', 'Berger', 'Conrad', 'breakthrough', 'session', 'Dr.', 'Berger', 'scene', 'where', 'Conrad', 'mother', 'reminiscing', 'Buck', 'room', 'two', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'carry', 'conversation', 'together', 'scene', 'when', 'Moore', 'finally', 'rigid', 'self-control', 'course', 'final', 'scene', 'Watch', 'scenes', 'actually', 'FEEL', 'what', 'character', 'feels', 'incredible', 'testament', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'writing', 'directing.I', 'believe', 'can', 'identify', 'element', 'tragic', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'presented', 'here', 'perhaps', 'film', 'so', 'timeless', 'exceptional', 'movie', ""n't"", 'over-the-top', 'even', 'social', 'class', 'Jarretts', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'ordinary', 'film', 'impeccable', 'here', 'what', 'identify', 'film', ""'ve"", 'tragically', 'lost', 'close', 'family', 'member', 'not', 'wish', 'were', 'ordinary', 'people', 'characters', 'have', 'deeper', 'emotions', 'tragedies', 'threaten', 'break']",Ordinary People VHS

Timothy Hutton was a newcomer, but I had grown up watching, and adoring Mary Tyler-Moore on TV on her show, and reruns of ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"".  It was somewhat startling to see her in this role of the icy-cold Beth Jarrett, but after a few moments on-screen one forgets completely that we're watching ""Mare!"" and she instantly becomes this character.I can't say enough about this movie - it has always been one of my top five favorite all-time films.Robert Redford (who won a Best Director Oscar) did a superb job casting and directing it.  Of course, hindsight is 20/20, but can anyone imagine other actors in the roles of ""Conrad"" (Timothy Hutton - who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar), ""Calvin"" (incredibly, heart-breakingly-portrayed by Donald Sutherland)and of course ""Beth""?  Who other than Judd Hirsch can you imagine bringing such tenderness, caring and compassion to the character of Conrad's psychiatrist, ""Dr. Berger""?As another reviewer stated so succinctly, there are so many layers to this film, you literally can't blink, or you'll miss something.  In fact, 23 years later, having watched it maybe fifty times, I still have a new realization in every viewing.I've also read the book, and while it was a wonderful book, the movie is far and away more emotional.Be prepared; this is not a ""feel-good"" movie by any stretch of the imagination.  It is thought-provoking, tragic, emotional and gut-wrenching, and it might make you re-evaluate aspects of your life. The subject-content (accidental death, severe depression, suicide) is very serious and can be upsetting or even depressing.This film also won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1980. I must add that no matter how incredible the entire cast, Timothy Hutton is the STAR of this film, and the Oscar he won, though well-earned, should have been for Best Actor.  Whomever thinks that the role of Conrad was a supporting one, needs to re-evaluate that opinion.If you're considering purchasing this movie, do not consider further - just order it.

223704,A12FLZREV32JOP,6300216977,Noelle Eiram,"[1, 1]","The moving film 'Ordinary People' details a family recovering from one son's accidental death and another son's failed suicide attempt. Conrad Jarrett (Timothy Hutton) is the teenage son, dealing with post-traumatic stress; he almost died along with his brother, whom he watched drown, and memories of his near suicide hang over him. Beth (Mary Tyler Moore), his mother, plays the perfect housewife, beautiful, active, charming, and all too practical. Calvin (Donald Sutherland), the compassionate father, is caught between his fragile son and brittle wife. We follow the parents, as they receive unhelpful advice from friends and colleagues, and Conrad, as he attempts to readjust to school life after returning from a psychiatric hospital. A psychiatrist, Dr. Berger (Judd Hirsch), causes Conrad to confront his feelings.Robert Redford emphasizes the pristine homes of affluent families and their amusingly mundane small talk, masking the deeper issues in these individuals' lives. The dialogue is funny, introspective, and believable. Because of the presence of a psychiatrist and a focus on intense emotional upheaval, characters delve deep into feelings. Sometimes the theories and speeches come across as dated and affected; symbols and realizations are at times overdone. Still, the film holds up remarkably well after thirty years.The acting is all around excellent. Hutton is lovely as the awkward Conrad, internally tumultuous and outwardly tense. As the genial but passive father, Sutherland ably portrays Calvin's desire to appease his wife and aid his pained but impenetrable son. Moore is remarkable as Beth, a woman whose intense selfishness, resentment, and fear emerge as smiling, rigid perfectionism. Hirsch's is an appealing presence in a rare positive portrayal of a psychiatrist, and Conrad's teenage peers, both obtuse and guileless, are realistic.Pachelbel's Canon comprises almost the entire, spare score. This can be grating, but other melodies are usually blessedly subtle. 'Ordinary People' ultimately suffers a touch from time and contrivance, but, overall, it a powerful, therapeutic depiction of a family striving to push through grief and depression.",5,you tell me the meaning of happy,1255564800,"10 15, 2009",2009,2181,"['moving', 'film', ""'Ordinary"", 'People', 'details', 'family', 'recovering', 'one', 'son', 'accidental', 'death', 'son', 'failed', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'Conrad', 'Jarrett', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'teenage', 'son', 'dealing', 'post-traumatic', 'stress', 'almost', 'died', 'brother', 'whom', 'watched', 'drown', 'memories', 'near', 'suicide', 'hang', 'Beth', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'mother', 'perfect', 'housewife', 'beautiful', 'active', 'charming', 'too', 'practical', 'Calvin', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'compassionate', 'father', 'caught', 'fragile', 'son', 'brittle', 'wife', 'follow', 'parents', 'receive', 'unhelpful', 'advice', 'friends', 'colleagues', 'Conrad', 'readjust', 'school', 'life', 'returning', 'psychiatric', 'hospital', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'Berger', 'Judd', 'Hirsch', 'Conrad', 'confront', 'feelings.Robert', 'Redford', 'pristine', 'homes', 'affluent', 'families', 'amusingly', 'mundane', 'small', 'talk', 'masking', 'deeper', 'issues', 'individuals', 'lives', 'dialogue', 'funny', 'introspective', 'believable', 'presence', 'psychiatrist', 'focus', 'intense', 'emotional', 'upheaval', 'characters', 'delve', 'deep', 'feelings', 'Sometimes', 'theories', 'speeches', 'come', 'dated', 'affected', 'symbols', 'realizations', 'are', 'times', 'overdone', 'Still', 'film', 'up', 'remarkably', 'well', 'thirty', 'years.The', 'acting', 'excellent', 'Hutton', 'lovely', 'awkward', 'Conrad', 'internally', 'tumultuous', 'outwardly', 'tense', 'genial', 'passive', 'father', 'Sutherland', 'ably', 'Calvin', 'desire', 'appease', 'wife', 'aid', 'pained', 'impenetrable', 'son', 'Moore', 'remarkable', 'Beth', 'woman', 'intense', 'selfishness', 'resentment', 'fear', 'emerge', 'smiling', 'rigid', 'perfectionism', 'Hirsch', 'appealing', 'presence', 'rare', 'positive', 'portrayal', 'psychiatrist', 'Conrad', 'teenage', 'peers', 'obtuse', 'guileless', 'are', 'realistic.Pachelbel', 'Canon', 'almost', 'entire', 'spare', 'score', 'can', 'be', 'grating', 'other', 'melodies', 'are', 'usually', 'blessedly', 'subtle', ""'Ordinary"", 'People', 'ultimately', 'touch', 'time', 'contrivance', 'overall', 'powerful', 'therapeutic', 'depiction', 'family', 'striving', 'push', 'grief', 'depression']",Ordinary People VHS

223708,A3I4EX7TBWUT1U,6300216977,"""patrick_mcknight""","[1, 1]","""Ordinary People"" has got to be one of the most moving films I've seen in quite a while.  I have to say, some of the issues and events depicted here struck uncomfortably close to home for me.This was actor Robert Redford's directorial debut, and it won the 1980 Oscar for Best Picture.  It tells the story of an upper-class family living in a quiet country town.  The family of three are trying to come to terms with the accidental death of their older son in a boating accident.The main focus of the film is on the guilt stricken younger son, Conrad, very well played by Timothy Hutton.  Conrad has spent several months in a mental institution after attempting suicide.  Now he must try to pick up the pieces and go back to school.  Unfortunately, things aren't that easy.  Conrad finds it difficult to fit in with his roudy and obnoxious friends, and many people are now avoiding him.  Conrad's swim coach  regards Conrad with a mixture of fascination and disgust.  To make matters worse, his mother seems to hold Conrad responsible for his brother's death, causing a lot of tension at home.  An emerging relationship with the girl at school seems to be the only bright spot in Conrad's life.Donald Sutherland is effective as Calvin, Conrad's well meaning father.  Calvin wants to help Conrad, but doesn't seem to know exactly how.  Calvin's a nice, essentially non-confrontational man who tries to act as the peacekeeper of the family.Mary Tyler Moore is also very good as Conrad's mother, Beth.  On the surface Beth is your picture-perfect mother and wife.  Yet there's something off, even selfish about Beth.  As we learn, she openly preferred Conrad's older brother Buck who was better at everything.  Now that Buck is gone, Beth allows her hostility towards Conrad to come to the surface.  Besides blaming Conrad for Buck's death, she despises him for attempting suicide, which, as she sees it, ruined her reputation in the community as the perfect mother.  Beth will never forgive Conrad for doing this to her, and Conrad's father doesn't want to face up to Beth's essentially cold nature.The somewhat weaker part of the movie for me was Conrad's sessions with Dr. Berger.  Dr. Berger uses psychoanalysis to help Conrad deal with the root of his guilt.  I'm not very big on psychoanalysis as I think much of it is outdated, based on the now debunked methods of Dr. Sigmund Freud.  Nevertheless, while these scenes don't add much to the movie, neither do they detract.I've wondered a lot about why Beth is so hostile towards Conrad.  Well, maybe it's because she senses, correctly, that Conrad sees past Beth's cheerful facade.  Beth despises Conrad for seeing the selfishness to her character that she has so effectively disguised from others.The place the film is set is quite beautiful.

223710,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,6300216977,P Magnum,"[5, 13]","1980's Ordinary People was superstar Robert Redford's directorial debut.  The film centers around an upper class Midwestern family, The Jarretts, whose lives are shattered when the oldest son of two is killed in a boating accident.  As the want of many families when tragedies strike, they bottle their feelings up and try to pretend if they don't talk about what happened, the pain will go away.  The younger son, Conrad (Timothy Hutton), was apart of the boating accident and he feels that it was his fault.  He can no longer stand the guilt and pain and tries to commit suicide.  Conrad then starts seeing a psychiatrist, Dr. Berger (Judd Hirsch), and he starts facing his true feelings and the deep seated denial that exists in his dysfunctional family.  Conrad's parents, Calvin & Beth (Donald Sutherland & Mary Tyler Moore), have their own struggles as Beth refuses to show any emotion towards Calvin and the death of their son.  Cal desperately tries to hold his broken family together, but the pressure starts to weigh too heavily on him.  The film is full of excellent performances.  Ms. Moore plays totally against her normally upbeat personality by making Beth into the ultimate ice queen.  Mr. Hirsch is very good and Mr. Hutton won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role.  But the unsung hero is Mr. Sutherland, who is not only the glue who is trying to hold his family together, but the is backbone of the film.  Mr. Redford does a fine job in his directing debut and he won his only Oscar for Best Director.  The film also won Best Picture, but despite all the accolades, it is just a very good film, not a great one.  It plays a little too heavily on the melodramatic and tends to be overly depressing in places.  The film beat out what is considered by many to best film of the 1980's, Raging Bull, for best picture and Mr. Redford beat out Raging Bull's director, Martin Scorcese, in the directing category.",3,Family Melodrama,1041897600,"01 7, 2003",2003,1931,"['1980', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'was', 'superstar', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'directorial', 'debut', 'film', 'centers', 'upper', 'class', 'Midwestern', 'family', 'Jarretts', 'lives', 'are', 'shattered', 'when', 'oldest', 'son', 'two', 'killed', 'boating', 'accident', 'want', 'many', 'families', 'when', 'tragedies', 'strike', 'bottle', 'feelings', 'up', 'try', 'pretend', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'what', 'happened', 'pain', 'will', 'go', 'away', 'younger', 'son', 'Conrad', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'was', 'apart', 'boating', 'accident', 'was', 'fault', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'stand', 'guilt', 'pain', 'tries', 'commit', 'suicide', 'Conrad', 'then', 'seeing', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'Berger', 'Judd', 'Hirsch', 'facing', 'true', 'feelings', 'deep', 'seated', 'denial', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'Conrad', 'parents', 'Calvin', 'Beth', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'have', 'own', 'struggles', 'Beth', 'show', 'emotion', 'towards', 'Calvin', 'death', 'son', 'Cal', 'desperately', 'hold', 'broken', 'family', 'together', 'pressure', 'weigh', 'too', 'heavily', 'film', 'full', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Ms.', 'Moore', 'totally', 'normally', 'upbeat', 'personality', 'making', 'Beth', 'ultimate', 'ice', 'queen', 'Mr.', 'Hirsch', 'very', 'good', 'Mr.', 'Hutton', 'won', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'role', 'unsung', 'hero', 'Mr.', 'Sutherland', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'glue', 'who', 'trying', 'hold', 'family', 'together', 'backbone', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Redford', 'fine', 'job', 'directing', 'debut', 'won', 'only', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Director', 'film', 'also', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', 'accolades', 'just', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'great', 'one', 'little', 'too', 'heavily', 'melodramatic', 'be', 'overly', 'depressing', 'places', 'film', 'beat', 'out', 'what', 'considered', 'many', 'best', 'film', '1980', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'best', 'picture', 'Mr.', 'Redford', 'beat', 'out', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'director', 'Martin', 'Scorcese', 'directing', 'category']",Ordinary People VHS
223711,A1K6K23WG0IBWE,6300216977,Quadro Sinead Summer,"[1, 1]","From director Robert Redford comes the classic american tear jerker. Timothy Hutton in a moving and touching performance plays a teenager named Conrad, who was present when his brother dies in a terrible accident. Conrad cannot come to terms with the tragedy and blames him self thinking he could have done something about it and saved his brother. He attempts to commit suicide, but his father(in a brilliant performance by Donald Sutherland)saves his life. Conrad is sent to a mental hospital to recover from the ordeal. Mean while his mother(Mary Tyler Moore) copes with the horrible tragedy by bottling everything up inside. Instead of embracing her husband and son she shuts them out. At a time when the family should have had a closer bond to deal with the events her coldness drives a wedge between her self and her son. Conrad is left to deal with his own pain about his brother's death, and the seemingly blameful and unsympathetic treatment from his mother. Judd Hirsch, in a wonderful performance, plays the psychiatrist who helps Conrad learn to cope. I loved this movie because it tells a story many families who have experienced tragedy can relate to, and because the film ends with a lot of things that are never resolved, the family ultimately in ruin. It's a depressing story yet riveting and emotional to experience. Hutton was absolutely brilliant playing the character who was faced with many puzzling problems and who exhibits an array of emotional moments.",5,It's representative of the finest in american cinema!

(Only 2 other movies, Metropolis and Saving Private Ryan, got that from me).  ****Spoilers****Director Robert Redford, in his directorial debut, makes cinematic perfection with the screenplay by Alvin Sargent (from the best selling novel by Judith Guest). Redford stays extremely true to the novel by Judith Guest and extracts exceptional performances from Hutton, Donald Sutherland (dad), Mary Tyler Moore (mom), the shrink (Judd Hirsch), the girlfriend (Elizabeth Perkins), and the swim coach (M. Emmet Walsh). It was Best Picture, Best Director (Redford in his debut), Best Supporting Actor (Hutton), and best Adapted Screenplay (Alvin Sargent - wrote Unfaithful).Conrad Jarett (Timothy Hutton) is a teenager struggling with trying to kill himself after his brother's accidental death but is now out of the hospital and seeing Doctor Burger (Judd Hirsh). The movie is seamless going from one scene to the next much akin to anxiety. It takes you into Conrad's struggles through the film, his father's (Sutherland) struggle with his own guilt, and his mom's (Mary Tyler Moore) disaffection for her son. The family falls apart even though dad is trying to keep it together while Conrad is in deep introspection and finding out who he really is inside. He's not his brash brother.Conrad and his shrink's exchanges are poignant, deep, and sometimes hilarious. He knows just when to push Connie. He knows when to let Connie vent. Even Dad goes to see him. Mom just can't seem to engage emotionally making Moore's performance something to behold. You see her anger or loss of feeling for Connie from the beginning while dad is supportive. While Conrad conquers his demons, they tear their marriage apart.One of the best lines is ""Where there's a real problem, there's a real answer."" Hutton's brilliant depiction of going through suicidal ideas is breathtaking.The beginning and the ending are brilliant. All in-between is a collage of a family falling apart while the son is facing his demons with success. The movie is deep with raw emotion from everyone. It'll make you laugh, cry, and look deep inside yourself. I've seen it maybe 50 or so times. The classical music throughout just makes it even more emotionally driven.Ordinary People is anything but ordinary.

Robert Redford's directoial debut was most acute, with generous close-ups, and a profound respect for the script. Timothy Hutton is the center of this film, and the completeness of his incredible performance can make no one doubt why he won the Oscar (Supporting?). I won't rehash the plot because everyone else has done that. But there's the performance of Mary Tyler Moore, shedding her good girl image and playing a selfish control-freak mother with virtually no emotion. She's incapable of saying ""I Love You"" to anyone in her life, including herself. It's a classic performance, adding to her already respectable body of work. Judd Hirsch was pivotal to the goings-on as the shrink (also Oscar nominated), and Elizabeth McGovern was excellent in one of her first roles as Hutton's puppy-love (she was nominated the following year for ""Ragtime""). In a small but pivotal role, Dinah Manoff shines as the only person Hutton felt he could talk to, but ultimately, couldn't. Though this won most of the major Oscars (Picture, Director, Screenplay, Supp. Actor), the Academy should hang their heads in shame for ignoring the outstanding performance of Donald Sutherland. It was a subdued, centered performance that eventually made everything make sense. His final scene (with Moore) was so very sincere, and the closing scene (with Hutton), where they both said ""I Love You"" to each other, made everything seem all right. Even if he was nominated, it's hard to say if he could've beaten DeNiro in ""Raging Bull"". (I'm disappointed that Hutton's and McGovern's careers weren't greater.)

223718,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,6300216977,Robert J. Crawford,"[2, 2]","This is a absolutely wonderful and convincing film about affluent middle America and how a family confronts a tragedy that is outside of its normal control.  It is a story of change that is thrust upon people who are extremely secure in their environment, who are not used to things they cannot immediately master, dismiss, or anesthetize by a cushion of money and supportive relationships.The story centers on a sensitive and gifted younger son, who is caught in an existential anxiety that he cannot control.  Timothy Hutton delivers what I think is the finest performance of his career, his every gesture displaying the turmoil he is feeling inside.  He cannot feel anything, he complains, and is heading for another breakdown.  He deserved the Oscar for it.  But Donald Sutherland is also great as his father, who is struggling to cope with issues he has never confronted.  Finally, in perhaps her most subtle role, Mary Tyler Moore is the mother; afraid of genuine emotion, she had long been content to live in a comfortable predictability, long accustomed her role and milieu.  They are all reacting to unspeakable pain in their own ways, revealing their strengths and capacities.The final character in the film is Chicago's North Shore, a community that must be experienced to be believed. Redford portrays it with a sensitivity that is astonishing and not in the slightest condescending in spite of his many comical touches.  I grew up there and still feel it is more or less home, though I have long since left.  The place is one of the most affluent yet least cultured places in the US.  Its residents feel entitled to a natural continuation of their family patterns:  get a good job, probably related to finance in Chicago, and live a comfortable life of local prestige and style. I do not mean to imply that their lives are superficial or empty, just largely unquestioned and unquestioning, preoccupied with the generation of wealth and perpetuation of their ""class standing"" (for want of a better term).  However, if something disrupts this cocoon - personal tragedy, economic upheaval, or just not fitting in - they are forced to leave their comfort zone, often with devastating results but also with the potential to grow.The plot of the film is about the son, Conrad, as he begins to see a wonderful psychiatrist, who is completely straight with him as well as caring.  They develop a powerful relationship, a space where Conrad can be himself and experiment with a new way of being.  While the father is open to it, the mother refuses to recognize Conrad's struggle.  The results are surprising as the equilibrium of the family shifts fundamentally.Redford's film raises all of these issues with perfect emotional pitch.  I watched it with my daughter (14); our family had lived in the area for a couple of years - kind of a sabbatical from our home in Europe, to be near my parents.  She saw places we knew, recognized the types of people, and also learned about psychiatry (my father was a psychiatrist).  We were both moved to tears by the story and the outstanding acting and talked a lot about the film afterwards.  It is true art about what I have long viewed as an artless place.Warmly recommended.

Special kudos must be given to Mary Tyler Moore whose cold, unsympathetic portrayal of the mother, in complete contrast to her spunky TV roles in the Mary Tyler Moore Show and the Dick van Dyke Show, is a performance for the ages (how she could have lost the Academy Award for Best Actress to Sissy Spacek for The Coal Minor's Daughter is mind boggling).  The supporting roles of Judd Hirsh (another dramatic turn for a comedic TV actor from Taxi) and Elizabeth McGovern, in her first film role (the mother from Downton Abbey) are equally brilliant.There is not a false note in this movie from the opening panoramic view of the location to the very personal bittersweet ending.

223722,AM2PV53UX1JEQ,6300216977,R. Penola,"[7, 9]","Robert Redford brings Judith Guest's novel to the screen with razor-sharp eloquence.  This movie, a keenly observed portrait of an American family dealing with the loss of one of their own, has no fat.  The Oscar-winning screenplay by Alvin Sargeant sounds utterly true on the tongues of these  talented players, each of whom is drawn with empathy and humanity.  The  WASPy ambience underscores the central conflicts, both for Conrad (Timothy  Hutton), who battles his own guilt/demons, and between him and his  emotionally devastated mother and father.  Mary Tyler Moore deserved the  Oscar (she lost) for her portrayal of Beth, a woman who exists as a veneer,  and Dinah Manoff haunts you as a fellow suicide survivor whom Conrad  befriends.  Too, Elizabeth McGovern is awkwardly charming, like a new-born  fawn about to grow up; Donald Sutherland does a memorable turn as Conrad's  awakening dad.  Judd Hirsch brings a surprising but unaffected warmth to  the key role of psychiatrist, and while the movie stays within the confines  of its own fragile, upscale but emotionally crippled world, it makes a case  for therapy as a universal healing.  Set on Chicago's North Shore,  virtually no detail is without its own peculiar gravity, from the sound of  Beth's expensive shoes on the rich carpeting, to the jagged hair Conrad  butchers himself, to the shivery feeling Conrad engenders in the  uncomfortably real swimming scenes. Everything moves towards the revelation  that will unlock Conrad's heart at last, from the seasonal change of autumn  to winter, to the score -- a choral Pachelbel Canon whittled down to a  single key stroke on the piano -- to the psychiatrist's office becoming  darker, darker, darker still - until we find ourselves in the middle of a  painful Christmas night.  Ordinary People remains as powerful today as it  did when it was first released, a testimony to the power of honest  elegance, and to the spare, stripping away of the layers we often bury  ourselves within.

The movie centers around a regular  old American family, living in rural Illinois. The story starts as though  it's in the middle of something, and basically it is. The family has just  suffered a major loss, their older son Buck died in a boating accident, and  their other son Conrad survived. When Conrad feels he can't take it  anymore, he attempts suicide. The movie starts off just after he has  returned from the ward he attended for four months. And throughout the rest  of the movie, the family has to come to grips with their anger and their  shame and their pain. And you feel everything with them.  With outstanding  performances from Judd Hirsch (from Taxi! Ahhh!) as Conrad's pshychiatrist,  Timothy Hutton as Conrad, the troubled son, and Mary Tyler Moore as Beth,  the confused and angry mother. And although I enjoy Donald Sutherland's  acting, it seemed like his character was more passive than it was in the  book.

223728,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,6300216977,Sean Pasek,"[4, 4]","***POSSIBLE  SPOILERS***The loss of a loved one may be one of the most powerfully profound situations that people find themselves in.  And at some point, it is something that everyone must deal with at some time, and on some level.  Life has a way of throwing us curve balls.  We tell ourselves that we are ready for our parents to pass on when they reach old age, but life invariably never follows that protocol.  After losing my own father to an accident when I was just 19, I was suddenly forced to deal with the pain, grief, and anger that seems to coincide with such a tragedy.""Ordinary People"" is about a Midwestern family trying to deal with the loss of a child to a tragic boating accident.  One of the things that makes this film so powerful is that it is something that can happen to anyone.  If you've suffered loss, you find yourself relating to one of the three main characters.  If you haven't, you still find yourself on some level, identifying or getting a taste of what that loss might look like through the eyes and feelings of one or more of these characters.This was Robert Redford's directorial debut, and he deservedly took home the Oscar for Best Director.  He keeps things simple.  He doesn't let the story or the character become too bogged down in melo-drama, but allows the characters of the story to keep it moving.  The feeling is that this could (and does) happen to anyone, anywhere, at any time.Aside from the masterful direction, Redford chooses one of history's most powerful musical pieces that sounds as if it came from heaven itself: Pachebel's Canon in D Major.  The irony of this particular piece is that it can go with just about any life situation...times when you feel the most joyous and happy, and those times when you feel down or depressed...on any level, it works.  And there are several particularly powerful moments when this piece of music is used.  Several scenes start off with this song being introduced very slowly, one note at a time, on a piano, and one cannot help but be moved by it.The performances in this film are all top-notch.  Of the three main actors, I felt that Mary Tyler Moore, as Beth Jarrett, turned in the best performance of her career.  Her character is operating on so many levels.  She is trying to keep her family together.  She fights against the changes that have occurred, and she follows the ""old"" belief that grief and pain should be dealt with within the family, and not by outsiders.  The irony of this belief is that Beth, herself, is unable to deal with it, which explains why she cannot relate with her husband, and especially her son, while they try to.  Instead, Beth Jarrett chooses to lose herself in outside situations such as traveling, visiting friends and relatives, and basically doing anything to keep herself from having to think and relive the tragedy of losing one son and nearly losing the other as well.  She is like someone living inside of a glass bubble, fearful that anyone or anything might shatter it and reveal that she isn't nearly as strong as the faade she puts on; that she needs healing as much as Conrad.  She's hurting and in pain, but the sad part is that she will not recognize this, let alone accept it.  I feel that much of the resentment she conveys toward her son is because, through him, she cannot help but see her own pain...a pain she does not want to acknowledge or deal with.Donald Sutherland turned in an equally powerful performance as Calvin Jarrett.  He feels the loss just as bitterly as his wife and son, and yet he is the one trying to figure out a way to keep the family intact.  In a sense, he is the glue trying to hold everything together.  He goes so far as to encourage his son to seek professional help, because even Calvin and Beth have no idea what Conrad is dealing with, since Conrad doesn't open up or share with anyone.  Sometimes, the love of a parent must be in the realization of, ""I love you so much, that I know I am unable to help you, and so I am going to find someone who can.""  Calvin is this type of parent.  In many ways, even though he is the father, he takes on motherly traits.  He is affectionate, and he is trying very hard to get through to his son and to let him know how much he loves him.Timothy Hutton took home the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Conrad Jarrett.  He gives us a harrowing and even frightening depiction of a young man who is not only dealing with the loss of his brother, but also the guilt and responsibility that he feels that led to his brother's death.  Conrad feels cut-off from his family, and mostly from his mother who he feels hates him.  Conrad feels that she possibly even adds to his own sense of guilt by causing him to feel responsible for the loss of the one person with whom his mother related to the most: his brother.  Reluctantly, he seeks out professional help from Dr. Berger (wonderfully played by Judd Hirsch), and as the subsequent therapy sessions progress, Dr. Berger helps him to see that life often gives no reasons or explanations for what has happened, and that it is only in the letting go of the anger and guilt that Conrad can begin the healing process and move on with his life.""Ordinary People"" is about every-day people, which is why the title of this film is so aptly named.  The story and performances are heart-felt and powerful, but in a subtle way.  Nothing is over-the-top, and neither are the characters, which is probably why so many viewers find themselves easily relating to them.  Even over 30 years later, I still feel that this is one of the most poignantly powerful films I have ever seen, and it still easily holds up today.  The story demonstrates that ""bad"" things happen, and very often, there is no reason as to why, but that true healing begins in the acknowledgement of the anger and the pain, and that it is only in the ""letting go"" of the anger and guilt that healing can finally take place.",5,"Powerful Film About Family, Loss, and Healing",1325808000,"01 6, 2012",2012,5952,"['***POSSIBLE', 'SPOILERS***The',

I chanced upon this this film without knowing anything about it, except that it was Robert Redfords directorial debut, and was truly surprised!The narrative is remarkably credible and smooth. The writing is superb, there is not one moment in this film that feels false or &quot;acted.&quot; The dialogue is extremely well written, but Redford, like Clint Eastwood or Kunrick, was not afraid to exploit moments of silence as well.I cannot believe that Donald Sutherland wasn't even nominated for a supporting cast role, he leaves a taste of his presence long after the credits have rolled. Mary Tyler Moore was very successful in potraying the odious mother who cannot even feel her own despair after her favorite son's death in a boat accident. But hats off to the pivot of the movie, the younger brother who survived the accident, played flawlessly by Tim Hutton! I guess a performance that is also quite easily overlooked is that of Judd Hirsch, in a seemingly background but very important role of the younger son's psychiatrist.Somewhat atypical of Hollywood, there are no happy endings and chiming bells to &quot;Ordinary People.&quot; This is a deep, dark movie that journeys into the worst, most difficult situation a family must ever face, and comes out with a very natural resolution (of sorts.)A must-watch treat!",5,REALISTIC YET HAUNTING WALK THROUGH LOSS AND RECOVERY,1069459200,"11 22, 2003",2003,1496,"['may', 'have', 'seen', 'American', 'Beauty', 'Ice', 'Storm', 'moving', 'chronicles', 'everyday', 'lives', 'dysfunctional', 'families', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'movie', 'set', 'trend', 'chanced', 'film', 'knowing', 'anything', 'was', 'Robert', 'Redfords', 'directorial', 'debut', 'was', 'truly', 'surprised', 'narrative', 'remarkably', 'credible', 'smooth', 'writing', 'superb', 'not', 'one', 'moment', 'film', 'false', 'quot', 'quot', 'dialogue', 'extremely', 'well', 'written', 'Redford', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Kunrick', 'was', 'not', 'afraid', 'exploit', 'moments', 'silence', 'well.I', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'nominated', 'supporting', 'cast', 'role', 'taste', 'presence', 'long', 'credits', 'have', 'rolled', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'was', 'very', 'successful', 'potraying', 'odious', 'mother', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'feel', 'own', 'despair', 'favorite', 'son', 'death', 'boat', 'accident', 'off', 'pivot', 'movie', 'younger', 'brother', 'who', 'survived', 'accident', 'played', 'flawlessly', 'Tim', 'Hutton', 'guess', 'performance', 'also', 'quite', 'easily', 'overlooked', 'Judd', 'Hirsch', 'seemingly', 'background', 'very', 'important', 'role', 'younger', 'son', 'atypical', 'Hollywood', 'are', 'happy', 'endings', 'chiming', 'bells', 'quot', 'Ordinary', 'People.', 'quot', 'deep', 'dark', 'movie', 'worst', 'most', 'difficult', 'situation', 'family', 'must', 'ever', 'face', 'out', 'very', 'natural', 'resolution', 'sorts', 'must-watch', 'treat']",Ordinary People VHS

Stodgy, square and reeking of respectability, it nevertheless has an undeniable emotional pull.  If you'll meet it half way, you can expect a good cry.  But it's crap just the same.Aside from a few memorable performances (notably Judd Hirsh's affable shrink and Meg Mundy's subtle, hilarious turn as Mary Tyler Moore's dragon of a mother), the acting is almost uniformly bad -- obvious, self-conscious and &quot;Serious.&quot;  (Worst is MTM, who gives a performance of surpassing obtuseness.) Timidity and solemnity inform every camera angle, prop, set decoration, line of dialogue.  Redford's idea of seriousness, of tastefulness, leeches the vitality out of everything he touches.  &quot;Ordinary People&quot; is so dreadfully tasteful that it achieves its own form of vulgarity.  (Marvin Hamlish did the score; the main theme is Pachelbel's Canon; it is SUNG during the opening titles.)Redford records events as an outsider; he's a diligent, uninspired anthropologist:  his method is clinical, bloodless, but not especially observant.  He tells us little enough about these people, none of it new, but manages nonetheless to get it all wrong. Yes, of course, many &quot;nice&quot; upper-middle class families are emotionally crippled -- nobody would disagree that the price of gentility is a certain amount of emotional repression.  That's what good manners are all about.As an outsider, Redford attempts to remain above the fray, but at the very end, succumbs to the disastrous urge to choose sides:  these aren't real people after all -- they're heroes and villains, just like in the movies.  His heroes, to be sure, have a few attractive warts to give them a becoming vulnerability, but his villains are entirely bad -- evil, dishonest, selfish, narrow-minded, callous, dangerously psychotic liars.  They're all warts and no vulnerability.

You're own mother not being able to even fake affection for his son. I know Mary Tyler Moore' character is not exactly a monster it's just she doesn't know how to connect with his son (in her words the other son that died whom she get along just fine doesn't need parenting). The screenplay allows the characters in the movie to be three dimensional, it made you feel that based on the conversations and dialogues they had that there could be people in real life in that situation.Mary Tyler Moore gave a topnoth performance. She just understood the complexity of the role and she never made  a false move, from the big confrontation scenes to the quieter non-dialogue scenes. She was just consistently marvelous. The rest of the cast was great too. The underrated Donald Sutherland provided a good match for Moore. I love the dynamics between the two. Not to mention that they are very believable as a couple.This is just a great movie. Great performances from the cast, a perceptive and moving screenplay and an intelligent direction from Redford.

I was kind of skeptical about Redford (the 'gorgeous guy') as a director at first, but 10 minutes into this movie, those 'worries' flew far away.This is simply a brilliant film that deals very honestly about a family (although 'Ordinary' still seems odd to me, as we all don't live in affluent Chicago suburbs!) that is trying desperately to deal with a family death, and all the denial and emotions that surround it.  Judd Hirsch is simply awesome as the psychiatrist that deals with the troubled Timothy Hutton, and they develop a very special relationship - one that ends up integrated with the father.

223741,A3VAXB8CDYY5BG,6300216977,The Wingchair Critic,"[3, 3]","Robert Redford's directorial debut, 'Ordinary People,' which won the 1980 Academy Award for Best Picture, is an interesting, intelligent, and often insightful film which in many ways can be seen as kicking off American 80s cinema, arguably the last great era of American filmmaking thus far.Adapted from Judith Guest's novel of the same name, 'Ordinary People' is three-fourths a great film. The first ninety minutes are beautifully written, acted, and produced, but 'Ordinary People' lacks a satisfying climax or resolution, even if the ending of both the source novel and the screenplay were intended to be 'realistic' or 'life-like,' and therefore rather unresolved, even arbitrary.Since teenage protagonist Conrad Jarrett (Timothy Hutton) doesn't share his climatic spirit-freeing realization that he's suffering 'survivor's guilt' over his brother's death with either of his parents, we never learn whether his emotionally cold and extraverted mother, Beth (Mary Tyler Moore), has been  unconsciously holding his brother's death against him for the same reason.Though Beth is something approaching the villain of the film, her character deserves the  opportunity to undergo the same catharsis that Conrad does.Instead, on a moment's notice, after a tense confrontation with husband Calvin (Donald Sutherland), she, in rather absurd, unconvincing, and stereotypical fashion, packs a suitcase, gets into a taxi, and drives off to live with her family in Texas.Though the novel ends in the same way, it is a woefully weak manner in which to close the film, especially since it has been made clear throughout that Beth favored her first child, the now-dead Buck, over Conrad, and was even unconsciously enamored of him.So 'Ordinary People' bravely approaches Freud's concept of psychologically incestuous 'family romance,' but then slinks away from it in cowardly fashion.As a result, the film loses momentum in its last thirty minutes, and is ultimately unsatisfying. The viewer is left with the impression that Redford simply dropped the ball.Redford's involvement generated a lot of interest in the film at the time of its release, as did the novel casting of famous television comedian Mary Tyler Moore as the self-centered, ostensibly cold-blooded Beth.But audiences who closely followed the precedent-setting 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show' (1970-1977) during its run probably were less surprised, since, in the show's fifth season, Moore's optimistic, sweet-natured character, Mary Richards, took a decided turn for the worse, becoming inexplicably and unexplainably frustrated, brittle, and peevish. The Beth Jarrett of 'Ordinary People' was born right there in 1975, on Moore's own program.Moore, who was also nominated for an Oscar, does a credible job in the somewhat thankless role as the mannish Beth, especially in her chilly scenes with Hutton.Despite its title, 'Ordinary People' is really about upper middle class WASPs, their values, and their modes of expression and repression, who, even in the 1970s and early 1980s, couldn't really be considered 'ordinary people,' in the sense that the phrase potentially referred to 'the average American.'The Jarretts are a privileged upper middle class professional family who live in a large two-story home in a prosperous Chicago suburb; Calvin and Beth attend 'causal parties' at the home of their adult friends in which the men are nonetheless dressed in suits and ties. Calvin and Beth play golf, and belong to tony country clubs. Conrad, barring his mental health, is expected to go away to college after his high school graduation.In this sense, the film is one of the most notable American films specifically about WASPs as such. Conrad and his young friends, as well as their parents, appear as if they've stepped out of Lisa Birnbach's 'The Official Preppy Handbook,' also released in 1980.The viewer cannot help thinking that it was this WASP aspect of the novel, and its partial inditement of high WASP culture, which attracted the politically liberal Redford to the project.Mental illness and suicide among WASPs, and an apparent inability to communicate effectively, were greatly in the cinematic air of the period: Woody Allen's 'Annie Hall' (1977), 'Interiors' (1978) and 'Stardust Memories' (1980), and Lawrence Kasdan's 'The Big Chill' (1983) all addressed mentally and emotionally troubled upper class Anglo-Americans.'Ordinary People' is full of terrific performances, especially from Timothy Hutton as the suicidal Conrad, and Donald Sutherland, who actually retracts his broad acting range to play a believable upper middle class WASP father and tax accountant. Judd Hirsch also shines as Conrad's pragmatic and unorthodox psychiatrist, Dr. Berger.In much smaller parts , Elizabeth McGovern and Dinah Manoff create three-dimensional, shadow-casting characters out of fairly generic secondary roles.",4,Extra'Ordinary People',1356566400,"12 27, 2012",2012,4876,"['Robert', 'Redford', 'directorial', 'debut', ""'Ordinary"", 'People', 'won', '1980', 'Academy',

223742,A31BBNT8C62MLU,6300216977,Trancelucence (Leigh),"[0, 0]","This is one of my favorite books and movies.  As others have noted, this is one of those films so packed with meanings, it appeals to different people on different levels, and one can see new aspects with repeated viewings.  It is a brilliant character study of three very different responses to tragedy by members of a family.  The focus is on the son, Conrad (phenomenal), but I especially wanted to mention the spectacular depiction of what good psychiatry CAN be (ditto in the moviesSybilandLars and the Real Girl), and the moving, incredibly profound character of Beth, played by Mary Tyler Moore, heartbreaking.***SPOILER ALERT: YOU MAY WANT TO WAIT & READ THIS AFTER VIEWING THE FILM***  The many reviews here that speak to Beth's emptiness and coldness, miss the crux of the family dynamic, at least what I see. Beth has lost her favorite son, yes, and THEN, her other son attempts suicide. She CANNOT forgive him for that, cannot trust him, one terrible tragedy after another. And now, another one looms.  She's done had enough, shuts down. Why does she dump the french toast in the sink? She's struggling to contain her hurt and rage, TOO MUCH.  She nearly implodes several times, an emotional wreck just beneath the carefully composed surface.  She can't even tolerate a hug, for fear of breaking down, losing control.  She must keep a tight lid on at all times.  It's not that she doesn't feel anything, it's that she's afraid of feeling too much.  And the last thing she feels is loving, or forgiving.  She keeps Conrad at arm's length not because she hates him, but because he threatens her sanity, her equilibrium.  She can't TAKE any more.She is furious at catching her son in a new pack of lies, the pattern seems to be starting all over again.  Her previous wounds still fresh, she just wants to flee, escape.  She wants to maintain the status quo.  She feels her husband slipping away from her, putting her further off-kilter.  Many people react this way to loss and pain, horror over not having control over circumstance, for one thing. The hallmark of her personality is the need for control, order, her way of staving off fears (she's afraid of everything from barking dogs to pigeons to swimming pools).  Such people, when confronted with tragedy, often withdraw, kick into auto-pilot, like robots (the remark about the color of Calvin's shoes), a self-protective mechanism.  Common, crippling.Others' reaction might be to give more, love more, NEED more, as does Donald Sutherland's Calvin.  He, unlike his wife, hungers for increased intimacy.  In any case, the disparity between their two styles is just too much to be overcome, sadly.  And brilliantly, it's shown, that despite Berger's counsel to extend compassion and forgiveness to Beth, through the insidious effects of ""hindsight bias"" all her past behavior, previously thought charming, appropriate, even endearing, is reevaluated in light of her present emotional difficulties and found to be wanting. ""We would've been all right if there just hadn't been any MESS,"" sighs Calvin.  Tragic.Some reviewers mentioned that Beth was sorry Conrad survived, blamed him for surviving, since her beloved Buck did not.  I think not, in fact, the pivotal key to Conrad's turning the therapeutic corner, with Dr. Berger's help, was in realizing that the regret, sorrow at having survived while his brother did not was his OWN, not his mother's.Note [added later]:  What Beth WAS guilty of was refusing to go in for family counseling, as Dr. Berger, and her husband wanted.  Family therapy is incredibly powerful, and could've helped them heal severally and as a family.Another movie that explores the theme of incompatible parental responses to a child's death (but with a happier outcome for the Beth-like character, played by William Hurt) isThe Accidental Tourist (1988), another favorite film (and book).  I'd rather hoped for a sequel to Ordinary People with a similar ending.  But Ordinary People is a WONDERFUL movie, memorable and profound, thanks to the story, the incredible performances (by all, including Judd Hirsch's as Dr. Berger, equally astonishing) and Robert Redford's incisive direction.The book by Judith Guest is one of my all-time favorite books, and it is no small feat to translate such a book into a film every bit as good, as did screenwriter Alvin Sargent and director Robert Redford, simply amazing.  And one funny/touching line has entered our family lexicon, surprising how often it comes in handy (spoken by Dr. Berger to Calvin): ""That sounds more like the philosophy of a DRIFTER than a tax attorney!""

I knew immediately that it was because ""Raging Bull"" had lost.I'm not deriding ""Raging Bull"" in any way-- it was a fine film, and the directing/acting was terrific... But I knew very well that depite ""Bull""s admitted quality, this room of gorillas were furious and indignant not because they really appreciated the artistry of that film, but they wanted a macho film with lots of scenes of guys beating the hell out of each other to win... Some movie-goers would also vote for ""Pulp Fiction"" and even ""Kill Bill"" over, say, ""Ordinary People"" for Best Picture as the latter has no graphic violence.It's that simple, and that silly.The suggestion that this win was one of the greatest travesties in Acadamy award history is--- well, it's just a buncha raging bull.""Bull"" was good, but ""Ordinary People""s haunting (there's that word again), finely textured, understated view of a disintegrating middle-class family after the death with which none of them can deal of the in-house golden-boy, is the more affecting film. Some may claim the movie is now ""dated"" in that so many pictures have followed focusing on or dissecting middle class suburban life, but I've generally found those to be either too 80's-style-self-conscious, and/or too smug, and just quirkily unconnected to reality (and please dont confuse ""Terms of Endearment"" nor ""American Beauty"" with ""Ordinary People""!)""People"" succeeds through understatement and lack-of-pretense, and from the fact that it was filmed in a now-bygone era in which posturing and political correctness weren't required from the script or the participants.The Academy got it right.",5,Quiet but enduring classic... deserved its Oscars.,1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,1787,"['remember', 'being', 'dormitory', 'TV', 'room', 'when', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Picture', 'guys', 'screamed', 'hissed', 'booed', 'stormed', 'out.And', 'why', 'knew', 'immediately', 'was', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'had', 'lost.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'deriding', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'way', 'was', 'fine', 'film', 'directing/acting', 'was', 'terrific', 'knew', 'very', 'well', 'depite', 'Bull', 's', 'admitted', 'quality', 'room', 'gorillas', 'were', 'furious', 'indignant', 'not', 'really', 'appreciated', 'artistry', 'film', 'wanted', 'macho', 'film', 'lots', 'scenes', 'guys', 'beating', 'hell', 'other', 'win', 'movie-goers', 'would', 'also', 'vote', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'even', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'say', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'Best', 'Picture', 'latter', 'graphic', 'violence.It', 'simple', 'silly.The', 'suggestion', 'win', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'travesties', 'Acadamy', 'award', 'history', 'well', 'just', 'buncha', 'raging', 'bull', 'Bull', 'was', 'good', 'Ordinary', 'People', 's', 'haunting', 'word', 'again', 'finely', 'textured', 'understated', 'view', 'disintegrating', 'middle-class', 'family', 'death', 'none', 'can', 'deal', 'in-house', 'golden-boy', 'more', 'affecting', 'film', 'may', 'claim', 'movie', 'now', 'dated', 'so', 'many', 'pictures', 'have', 'followed', 'focusing', 'dissecting', 'middle', 'class', 'suburban', 'life', ""'ve"", 'generally', 'found', 'be', 'either', 'too', ""80's-style-self-conscious"", 'and/or', 'too', 'smug', 'just', 'quirkily', 'unconnected', 'reality', 'please', 'dont', 'confuse', 'Terms', 'Endearment', 'American', 'Beauty', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'People', 'understatement', 'lack-of-pretense', 'fact', 'was', 'filmed', 'now-bygone', 'era', 'posturing', 'political', 'correctness', 'were', ""n't"", 'required', 'script', 'participants.The', 'Academy', 'got', 'right']",Ordinary People VHS

I watched it again the other night (after finally purchasing it on DVD).  The performances from Tyler Moore, Sutherland and Hutton are so exceptional that they all deserved oscars.How does a family deal with the loss of a well-loved son from an accident?  Some will shut out their emotions like Tyler-Moore's character, while the son needs to show his emotions, and needs his mother more than ever.  However, she is cold towards him, almost blaming him for the death of his brother.  Sutherland is the husband and father caught in the middle of it all, who is also trying to deal with his own emotions over the death of his eldest son.Ordinary People was made in 1980 and directed by Robert Redford.

Ordinary People is a very emotional impacting film about the irrevocable damages that take place in Timothy Hutton's family when his brother died in a sailing accident. He's internally depressed and afflicted by this traumatic event. Both Mary Tyler Moore and Donald Southerland have not been able to face this harsh reality, and lived for years in silent grief. The three members of the family is no longer happy together, and they haven't moved on since the death of the boy. What can they do in order to let go and become a happy family again? Or can they still be happy together? I was very moved by the performances, especially from Timothy Hutton and Mary Tyler Moore. This film is very similar to The Door In The Floor, and Moore's role is also similar to Kim Basinger's, because they both have been devastated for years and have no more feelings about the family and their husband.",5,Trauma Changes Things and People.,1116806400,"05 23, 2005",2005,1101,"['When', 'someone', 'family', 'accident', 'family', 'never', 'same', 'issues', 'such', 'blame', 'forgiveness', 'trauma', 'not', 'dealt', 'ultimately', 'gaps', 'walls', 'other', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'very', 'emotional', 'impacting', 'film', 'irrevocable', 'damages', 'take', 'place', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'family', 'when', 'brother', 'died', 'sailing', 'accident', 'internally', 'depressed', 'afflicted', 'traumatic', 'event', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Donald', 'Southerland', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'face', 'harsh', 'reality', 'lived', 'years', 'silent', 'grief', 'three', 'members', 'family', 'no', 'longer', 'happy', 'together', 'have', ""n't"", 'moved', 'death', 'boy', 'What', 'can', 'do', 'order', 'let', 'go', 'become', 'happy', 'family', 'again', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'happy', 'together', 'was', 'very', 'moved', 'performances', 'especially', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'film', 'very', 'similar', 'Door', 'Floor', 'Moore', 'role', 'also', 'similar', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'have', 'been', 'devastated', 'years', 'have', 'more', 'feelings', 'family', 'husband']",Ordinary People VHS

They included at the time ""Eraserhead"", ""Dawn of the Dead"", and ""Alien"", and man, how I wanted to see those films! I did eventually see ""Alien"" via HBO early on but the two former films not until I was in my late twenties (by that time more through inavailability than disallowment).But the second catagory were films too 'adult' in theme and content, films my mother characterised as 'slit-your-wrist flicks', in other words utterly depressing and gloomy. They included Woody Allen's ""Interiors"" and ""Ordinary People"" by Robert Redford.I had already been traumatised by the death of ""The Little Prince"" in the film of the same name and by Disney's ""Bambi"" so I never understood what the big deal was - gloom I could handle. Yet, I saw neither Redford's nor Allen's film until last night on TCM.I was expecting a truly heart-wrenching and gut-turning plot and performance. What I receieved was a two hour info-mmercial for psychoanalysis wrapped in a pointless story concerning terrible events the viewer isn't even aware of until the film's end.Now, I like gloomy movies. The only thing to like here is a very beautiful, young and sweet Elizabeth McGovern. Hutton is sympathetic at least and it's nice to see Sutherland stick by him, but this is not the devasting film that it's advertisements portrayed when it came out.For 'devastating' I think there would have to be a sort of 'snow-ball effect' apparent in the plot. You should be able to feel things getting worse, picking up pace and ready to crash. It may be there in terms of Moore's and Sutherland's on screen relationship but it didn't reach me on an initial viewing. The film focuses to much on Hutton for this to be apparent or sincere. In fact, the entire ending felt tacked on, almost maliciously, in an effort to punish Moore's character.After waiting almost thirty years to be impressed I'm sorry to say that Redford's freshman effort left me disappointed.",2,"Bob, you're killing me!",1269561600,"03 26, 2010",2010,2193,"['When', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'was', 'released', 'was', '11', 'years', 'old', 'was', 'discouraged', 'not', 'actually', 'disallowed', 'see', 'folks.Now', 'were', 'two', 'catagories', 'films', 'fell', 'earn', ""'disallowment"", 'first', 'were', 'films', 'too', 'bizarre', 'horrific', 'be', 'seen', 'pre-teen', 'included', 'time', 'Eraserhead', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'Alien', 'man', 'how', 'wanted', 'see', 'films', 'did', 'eventually', 'see', 'Alien', 'HBO', 'early', 'two', 'former', 'films', 'not', 'was', 'late', 'twenties', 'time', 'more', 'inavailability', 'disallowment', 'second', 'catagory', 'were', 'films', 'too', ""'adult"", 'theme', 'content', 'films', 'mother', 'characterised', ""'slit-your-wrist"", 'flicks', 'other', 'words', 'utterly', 'depressing', 'gloomy', 'included', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Interiors', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'Robert', 'Redford.I', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'traumatised', 'death', 'Little', 'Prince', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'Disney', 'Bambi', 'never', 'understood', 'what', 'big', 'deal', 'was', 'gloom', 'could', 'handle', 'saw', 'Redford', 'Allen', 'film', 'last', 'night', 'TCM.I', 'was', 'expecting', 'truly', 'heart-wrenching', 'gut-turning', 'plot', 'performance', 'What', 'receieved', 'was', 'two', 'hour', 'info-mmercial', 'psychoanalysis', 'wrapped', 'pointless', 'story', 'concerning', 'terrible', 'events', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'even', 'aware', 'film', 'end.Now', 'like', 'gloomy', 'movies', 'only', 'thing', 'like', 'here', 'very', 'beautiful', 'young', 'sweet', 'Elizabeth', 'McGovern', 'Hutton', 'sympathetic', 'least', 'nice', 'see', 'Sutherland', 'stick', 'not', 'devasting', 'film', 'advertisements', 'portrayed', 'when', 'came', 'out.For', ""'devastating"", 'think', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'sort', ""'snow-ball"", 'effect', 'apparent', 'plot', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'feel', 'things', 'getting', 'worse', 'picking', 'up', 'pace', 'ready', 'crash', 'may', 'be', 'there', 'terms', 'Moore', 'Sutherland', 'screen', 'relationship', 'did', ""n't"", 'reach', 'initial', 'viewing', 'film', 'much', 'Hutton', 'be', 'apparent', 'sincere', 'fact', 'entire', 'ending', 'felt', 'tacked', 'almost', 'maliciously', 'effort', 'punish', 'Moore', 'character.After', 'waiting', 'almost', 'thirty', 'years', 'be', 'impressed', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'Redford', 'freshman', 'effort', 'left', 'disappointed']",Ordinary People VHS
