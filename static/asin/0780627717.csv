35639,AYGHUCNGQ0HMF,0780627717,aaron wittenberg,"[9, 10]","From the people I've talked to that had seen it, this sounded like a great movie. I finally got my chance to see it just a few days ago.I wasn't using computers back when this movie starts at Berkeley in the early 70's, but from the time the Apple I was invented until the IBM PC came around, I recall that history pretty well.This movie does an alright job explaining the starting of Microsoft and Apple. The downside is many interesting facts have been left out. The writers never mentioned why IBM made a personal computer. They did because almost every other computer related company was building computers, and they wanted to cash in on the market. The scene where Gates goes to IBM and offers them DOS was not entirely correct.What they didn't tell you is that IBM first offered the late Gary Kildahl (the owner of CP/M) to write DOS, and for whatever reason he wasn't interested. Next was Microsoft, and Bill Gates was interested, but he sold IBM something he didn't have. Instead, Gates bought 86-DOS for $50,000 from its author Tim Paterson who worked at Seattle Computer Products way back in 1980. Tim later went to work for Microsoft.Just think... had Gary been interested, his business would likely be the Microsoft of today.There are other small differences which the movie either didn't tell the full story, or it wasn't entirely accurate. They failed to mention that Microsoft supplied MS-DOS (they renamed 86-DOS for licensing and ownership) to IBM, but the IBM PC used virtually all Intel components. They failed to mention that a huge chunk of history came from Intel. It was also never mentioned that Apple Motorola for processors, or else their beloved Macintosh would not exist.They were right on track about Apple stealing the graphic interface from Xerox. It is true that Xerox invented it sometime during the early-mid 70's and the management wasn't interested in this invention. BIG mistake.Apple is often credited with inventing the GUI. Not true.I was a little surprised that the movie made no mention about how Microsoft teamed up with IBM back in the 80's and they worked on OS/2. Microsoft spent more time working on Windows and IBM finally finished OS/2 on their own. I truly feel if they had worked together on a single operating system, we would have one today that doesn't crash like Windows and actually worked like an operating system should.If you are even a little interested in the history of computers and how some of these huge companies started out, you might find this very interesting.I still remember using Windows 1.0 back in 1986. A lot has changed with it!So to close, this would make a good time killer and something you give you a little more knowledge about computer history. But please keep in mind, not all of the events are totally accurate, and a lot of critical information was left out.

35643,AOMDGKZTVIE9P,0780627717,Andrew Collins,"[1, 1]","In this 1999 television movie, the early rise of Microsoft and Apple Computer is dramatized. Focusing on the early careers and professional lives of several key people, the movie depicts several events that led to the personal computer revolution. The main characters are men that most have heard of at some time or another and include Steve Jobs (Noah Wyle) and Steve Wozniak (Joey Slotnick) on the Apple side and Bill Gates (Anthony Michael Hall) and Steve Ballmer (John DiMaggio) at Microsoft.The film is an entertaining look at the growth of the PC industry and how personal rivalries and competition between Apple and Microsoft helped shaped the entire world. The lives of Jobs and Gates are also examined. Both characters are human and are also deeply flawed. Jobs is depicted as being a kind of bully at Apple demanding high quality work and long hours while Gates struggles to search for supremacy. As we all know, he would end up as one of the wealthiest men on the planet. Both Jobs and Gates are shown as very shrewd businessmen and also the geeks that they were. In one amusing scene, Gates and Jobs argue about who stole GUI technology from Xerox first.Although the film does at times show its made-for-TV quality, this is more than made up for in a very strong script that is both entertaining and yet does not stray very far from the reality.In 97 minutes, this film is a good way to understand the early history of personal computing and the behind-the-scenes events and people that made it possible.",5,"""Good Artists Copy; Great Artists Steal""",1385251200,"11 24, 2013",2013,1516,"['1999', 'television', 'movie', 'early', 'rise', 'Microsoft', 'Apple', 'Computer', 'dramatized', 'Focusing', 'early', 'careers', 'professional', 'lives', 'several', 'key', 'people', 'movie', 'several', 'events', 'led', 'personal', 'computer', 'revolution', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'men', 'most', 'have', 'heard', 'time', 'include', 'Steve', 'Jobs', 'Noah', 'Wyle', 'Steve', 'Wozniak', 'Joey', 'Slotnick', 'Apple', 'side', 'Bill', 'Gates', 'Anthony', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'Steve', 'Ballmer', 'John', 'DiMaggio', 'Microsoft.The', 'film', 'entertaining', 'look', 'growth', 'PC', 'industry', 'how', 'personal', 'rivalries', 'competition', 'Apple', 'Microsoft', 'helped', 'shaped', 'entire', 'world', 'lives', 'Jobs', 'Gates', 'are', 'also', 'examined', 'characters', 'are', 'human', 'are', 'also', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'Jobs', 'depicted', 'being', 'kind', 'bully', 'Apple', 'demanding', 'high', 'quality', 'work', 'long', 'hours', 'Gates', 'struggles', 'search', 'supremacy', 'know', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'one', 'wealthiest', 'men', 'planet', 'Jobs', 'Gates', 'are', 'shown', 'very', 'shrewd', 'businessmen', 'also', 'geeks', 'were', 'one', 'amusing', 'scene', 'Gates', 'Jobs', 'argue', 'who', 'stole', 'GUI', 'technology', 'Xerox', 'film', 'times', 'show', 'made-for-TV', 'quality', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'very', 'strong', 'script', 'entertaining', 'yet', 'not', 'stray', 'very', 'far', 'reality.In', '97', 'minutes', 'film', 'good', 'way', 'understand', 'early', 'history', 'personal', 'computing', 'behind-the-scenes', 'events', 'people', 'made', 'possible']",N/A
35644,A1LH7YTNTWP6MT,0780627717,Andrew Furst,"[0, 0]","Hugely enjoyable and quite accurate (by most accounts) telling of the rise and ultimate clash of two modern tech titans, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates.  Canadian Martyn Burke deserves great credit for both writing and directing this gem.  While made for television, this is better by far than most made-for-theater Hollywood productions.  The 70's and 80's music fits especially well; tremendously appropriate songs and soundtrack for the story.  And the use of the famous Apple ""1984"" commercial, compared with the vision of a huge, televised Bill Gates hovering over a humbled Steve Jobs is absolutely brilliant.The dual narration is brilliant too, using the Steve Wozniak character to narrate the Apple story, while the Steve Ballmer character narrates the Microsoft side of things.  Sure, there are major oversimplifications of many characters, and while a Paul Allen character is an active presence here - we learn virtually nothing about him as a person.  But so what?  As the commentary on the DVD points out, there's an almost Shakespearean feel to much of this. The focus is on the events surrounding the ultimate clash for PC superiority between Apple and Microsoft, and on Jobs himself, to a lesser extent on Gates. With no attempt to fully flesh out the other players (and none needed, in the particular story that's being told/dramatized). A few weakish scenes are included, but not many; virtually every scene adds a dimension to the plot and to the ultimate conclusion.  The pace is very good, very strong.  Noah Wyle gives a terrific performance as Steve Jobs; Anthony Michael Hall is also excellent as Bill Gates.  And the DVD has a brief but interesting and entertaining introduction by Wyle; be sure to view it.As to any ""inaccuracies"", from what I can tell those are very, very minor.  Those interested may want to check Steve Wozniak's website, a section (in ""letters"") discusses his take on this movie.  In a nutshell, Woz was not consulted for the movie, and was flattered by the way he was portrayed.  He seemed to feel the movie was accurate or portrayed accuracies; he mentions a few things such as they weren't allowed to wear the ""Alice in Wonderland"" costumes home, but changed out of them before leaving the performance - personally I thought it was a nice touch to have them walking home while still in costume. Also there's some obvious dialog added for humorous or dramatic purposes; for example, in one scene the Gates character tries to connect socially with women by complimenting their ""bandwidth"" and by attempting to imitate John Travolta's disco moves while on rollerskates - funny, almost believable, but not likely strict reality.  Or when both Jobs and Gates quote the Picasso line about ""...great artists steal"", but Gates (unlike Jobs) doesn't really care which artist said it.  Minor stuff like that should be treated as artistic/dramatic license, not absolute reality. It's a movie (or docudrama), not a strict documentary, yet still manages to make a great story while still being essentially true to the reality of the events. (By the way, ""Insanely Great"" was of course an Apple marketing phrase for the Mac, created by Steve Jobs himself; so I'm not meaning to infringe on any copyright there!).",5,Insanely great!,1180828800,"06 3, 2007",2007,3242,"['Hugely', 'enjoyable', 'quite', 'accurate', 'most', 'accounts', 'telling', 'rise', 'ultimate', 'clash', 'two', 'modern', 'tech', 'titans', 'Steve', 'Jobs', 'Bill', 'Gates', 'Canadian', 'Martyn', 'Burke', 'great', 'credit', 'writing', 'directing', 'gem', 'made', 'television', 'better', 'far', 'most', 'made-for-theater', 'Hollywood', 'productions', '70', '80', 'music', 'especially', 'well', 'tremendously', 'appropriate', 'songs', 'soundtrack', 'story', 'use', 'famous', 'Apple', '1984', 'commercial', 'compared', 'vision', 'huge', 'televised', 'Bill', 'Gates', 'hovering', 'over', 'humbled', 'Steve', 'Jobs', 'absolutely', 'brilliant.The', 'dual', 'narration', 'brilliant', 'too', 'using', 'Steve', 'Wozniak', 'character', 'narrate', 'Apple', 'story', 'Steve', 'Ballmer', 'character', 'Microsoft', 'side', 'things', 'Sure', 'are', 'major', 'oversimplifications', 'many', 'characters', 'Paul', 'Allen', 'character', 'active', 'presence', 'here', 'learn', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'about', 'person', 'so', 'what', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'points', 'out', 'almost', 'Shakespearean', 'feel', 'much', 'focus', 'events', 'surrounding', 'ultimate', 'clash', 'PC', 'superiority', 'Apple', 'Microsoft', 'Jobs', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Gates', 'attempt', 'fully', 'flesh', 'out', 'other', 'players', 'none', 'needed', 'particular', 'story', 'being', 'told/dramatized', 'few', 'weakish', 'scenes', 'are', 'included', 'not', 'many', 'virtually', 'scene', 'dimension', 'plot', 'ultimate', 'conclusion', 'pace', 'very', 'good', 'very', 'strong', 'Noah', 'Wyle', 'terrific', 'performance', 'Steve', 'Jobs', 'Anthony', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'also', 'excellent', 'Bill', 'Gates', 'DVD', 'brief', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'introduction', 'Wyle', 'be', 'sure', 'view', 'it.As', 'inaccuracies', 'what', 'can', 'tell', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'minor', 'interested', 'may', 'want', 'check', 'Steve', 'Wozniak', 'website', 'section', 'letters', 'take', 'movie', 'nutshell', 'Woz', 'was', 'not', 'consulted', 'movie', 'was', 'flattered', 'way', 'was', 'portrayed', 'seemed', 'feel', 'movie', 'was', 'accurate', 'portrayed', 'accuracies', 'few', 'things', 'such', 'were', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'wear', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'home', 'changed', 'leaving', 'performance', 'personally', 'thought', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'have', 'walking', 'home', 'still', 'costume', 'Also', 'obvious', 'dialog', 'added', 'humorous', 'dramatic', 'purposes', 'example', 'one', 'scene', 'Gates', 'character', 'tries', 'connect', 'socially', 'women', 'complimenting', 'bandwidth', 'attempting', 'imitate', 'John', 'Travolta', 'disco', 'moves', 'rollerskates', 'funny', 'almost', 'believable', 'not', 'likely', 'strict', 'reality', 'when', 'Jobs', 'Gates', 'quote', 'Picasso', 'line', 'great', 'artists', 'steal', 'Gates', 'Jobs', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'artist', 'said', 'Minor', 'stuff', 'should', 'be', 'treated', 'artistic/dramatic', 'license', 'not', 'absolute', 'reality', 'movie', 'docudrama', 'not', 'strict', 'documentary', 'yet', 'still', 'make', 'great', 'story', 'still', 'being', 'essentially', 'true', 'reality', 'events', 'way', 'Insanely', 'Great', 'was', 'course', 'Apple', 'marketing', 'phrase', 'Mac', 'created', 'Steve', 'Jobs', 'so', ""'m"", 'not', 'meaning', 'infringe', 'copyright', 'there']",N/A

I love these kinds of films, but somehow this one just missed the mark for me. I feel this movie could have had so much more story or history to it, but it focused mainly on portraying the two main characters as flawed, cold hearted, greedy souls, willing to use those closest to them and step on anyone to get to the top. Portraying one as an inept alcoholic and the other as a heartless druggie, the movie makes it seem that neither character did anything but use everyone who came into their path to make their way through life, all while being drunk or stoned.After watching the movie, I didn't really feel like I had watched a film, but instead just listened to someones gossip, telling me every horrible thing these two men had ever done in their life. Nothing good is ever mentioned it seems, in an attempt to make all that has been accomplished in their company names seem like a big scam. I found myself wishing there was more reasons given in the movie for their actions.

35655,A1QU1TBJIO4N89,0780627717,"Christopher A. Fulkerson ""Composer""","[1, 1]","It's de rigueur I suppose, but likable enough.  What surprised me about the ""Pirates"" was how well the detail about the 1960s and 1970s pop culture was used, and the sense of how Frat-house activity carried over into the later lives of the characters.  The Moody Blues sounded their ""Question"" more sharply even than it sounded back then.  The scene of Primal Scream therapy is very relevant; that was a major movement that is now often forgotten.  Some pop culture elements are occluded, but deepen the meanings.  Checking my own historic documents I find that in 1974 they cannot have been talking about either Playboy's Miss August or Miss October, but Miss May, Marilyn Lange, who was rightly Playmate of the Year, and her face is similar enough to that on the issue we see.  Context therefore suggests a truly raunchy metaphor about what it is that holds the tower of Playboys together.  Lifting a soiled sock on a stick to sleeping Bill Gates's nose thus has heightened frat significance, especially as we can now say it was Gates's sock.  (I said it was bad.)  There is not excessive heroism to any characterizations, though Bill Gates is portrayed as a particularly savvy operator with multiple agendas.  Steve Wozniac comes off as very humane, especially in that he wanted to give shares to some old friend named Dan.  I noticed that right after Wozniac tells Jobs he, Wozniac, is the brakes that keeps Jobs from running into a wall, in the very next scene, a justifiably angry programmer says ""Steve, not again,"" and when provoked runs Jobs into a wall, bloodying his nose.  That was astute scriptwriting, i.e., without proper brakes, Jobs will run into a wall.  Maybe that's what Jobs gets for hiring a Lyft (or, let us say, what Google will get for hiring Uber).  That's where the real piracy in the movie is best implied.There are some lacunae about who is who, and who knows who.  In the beginning we are shown Steve Jobs and Bill Gates in the same crowd playing poker; this makes the later scene in which Jobs doesn't recognize Gates to be a script disconnect.  I am always surprised that nobody seems to notice the number of guys named Steve.  It's almost as though something were going on with that.  A joke, probably by Woz, about all the Steves, seems called for.  The character I myself identified with was the boy who jabs Steve Jobs, who is playing the Mad Hatter, with a pencil.  When I was in graduate school I wrote a review for the Berkeley Graduate panning a composer who writes too many Alice in Wonderland pieces.  As a composer and conductor myself, I thought the bits about Jobs ""conducting"" were hackneyed and tiresome, but for now I will suppose that is just a clich&eacute; that the scriptwriters indulged.",4,A Few Cliches and Plot Disconnects (And You Must Mean Miss MAY 1974),1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,2740,"['de', 'rigueur', 'suppose', 'likable', 'enough', 'What', 'surprised', 'Pirates', 'was', 'how', 'well', 'detail', '1960s', '1970s', 'pop', 'culture', 'was', 'used', 'sense', 'how', 'Frat-house', 'activity', 'carried', 'later', 'lives', 'characters', 'Moody', 'Blues', 'sounded', 'Question', 'more', 'sharply', 'even', 'sounded', 'back', 'then', 'scene', 'Primal', 'Scream', 'therapy', 'very', 'relevant', 'was', 'major', 'movement', 'now', 'often', 'forgotten', 'pop', 'culture', 'elements', 'are', 'occluded', 'meanings', 'Checking', 'own', 'historic', 'documents', 'find', '1974', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'talking', 'Playboy', 'Miss', 'August', 'Miss', 'October', 'Miss', 'May', 'Marilyn', 'Lange', 'who', 'was', 'rightly', 'Playmate', 'Year', 'face', 'similar', 'enough', 'issue', 'see', 'Context', 'therefore', 'truly', 'raunchy', 'metaphor', 'what', 'tower', 'Playboys', 'together', 'Lifting', 'soiled', 'sock', 'stick', 'sleeping', 'Bill', 'Gates', 'nose', 'thus', 'heightened', 'frat', 'significance', 'especially', 'can', 'now', 'say', 'was', 'Gates', 'sock', 'said', 'was', 'bad', 'not', 'excessive', 'heroism', 'characterizations', 'Bill', 'Gates', 'portrayed', 'particularly', 'savvy', 'operator', 'multiple', 'agendas', 'Steve', 'Wozniac', 'off', 'very', 'humane', 'especially', 'wanted', 'give', 'shares', 'old', 'friend', 'named', 'Dan', 'noticed', 'right', 'Wozniac', 'Jobs', 'Wozniac', 'brakes', 'keeps', 'Jobs', 'running', 'wall', 'very', 'next', 'scene', 'justifiably', 'angry', 'programmer', 'Steve', 'not', 'again', 'when', 'provoked', 'Jobs', 'wall', 'bloodying', 'nose', 'was', 'astute', 'scriptwriting', 'i.e.', 'proper', 'brakes', 'Jobs', 'will', 'run', 'wall', 'Maybe', 'what', 'Jobs', 'hiring', 'Lyft', 'let', 'say', 'what', 'Google', 'will', 'get', 'hiring', 'Uber', 'where', 'real', 'piracy', 'movie', 'best', 'are', 'lacunae', 'who', 'who', 'who', 'who', 'beginning', 'are', 'shown', 'Steve', 'Jobs', 'Bill', 'Gates', 'same', 'crowd', 'playing', 'poker', 'later', 'scene', 'Jobs', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'Gates', 'be', 'script', 'disconnect', 'am', 'always', 'surprised', 'nobody', 'notice', 'number', 'guys', 'named', 'Steve', 'almost', 'something', 'were', 'going', 'joke', 'probably', 'Woz', 'Steves', 'called', 'character', 'identified', 'was', 'boy', 'who', 'Steve', 'Jobs', 'who', 'playing', 'Mad', 'Hatter', 'pencil', 'When', 'was', 'graduate', 'school', 'wrote', 'review', 'Berkeley', 'Graduate', 'panning', 'composer', 'who', 'too', 'many', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'pieces', 'composer', 'conductor', 'thought', 'bits', 'Jobs', 'conducting', 'were', 'hackneyed', 'tiresome', 'now', 'will', 'suppose', 'just', 'clich', 'eacute', 'scriptwriters', 'indulged']",N/A

But each had certain friends. Jobs had Steve Wozniack, essentially a techie tinkerer who could invent small gizmos which could defraud the phone company. Gates had Paul Allen who knew something about computers. The Pirates of Silicon Valley chronicles the escapades and misadventures of the young upstarts who created the industry that the old guard couldn't really see yet alone understand. An industry which now permeates all aspects of modern life.These crazy young inexperienced radicals who began their careers in garages and motels would mold what would become the entire PC market. Jobs and Woz founded Apple and created the first personal computer, the Apple I and Apple II. Gates created Microsoft and licensed an operating for IBM which would become MS-DOS, bought from a small fledging software company in Seattle for $50,000, although Wikipedia's article on the subject states it was $75,000.Then Jobs and his colleagues are brought to the Xerox development center where technicians were creating a computer with graphical interface. The Xerox executives had been given a demonstration of their new technology, but the old-school executives couldn't understand its potential as benefiting their company. Ultimately, they reject the new innovations. Jobs is given full demonstrations of the computers and understands the potential behind the new technology. He then begins the creation of the Macintosh (MAC). Eventually, a rift occurs within Apple between those who worked on Apple II and those working on the MAC. At the same time, Bill Gates creates Windows to utilize the graphical interface being used by Jobs which was originally invented by Xerox technicians. Which then incites the war between Apple and Microsoft.An excellent portrayal of the strange and often unbelievable circumstances surrounding the creation and eventual marketing of personal computers. Anthony Michael Hall is perfectly cast as Bill Gates, and Joey Slotnick does well as Steve Wozniack. However, Noah Wyle steals the show as Steve Jobs. Wyle captures the subtlety of Jobs as the driven genius whose faith in his own vision often eclipses common sense in terms of personal relationships. Jobs was no question one of the great visionaries of the 20th century, but he did not understand how to motivate and empower those around him.

And there, dear readers, lies the  tale of the century.Kudos for the director, the casting director, and  the fine performances from Hall and Wyle.  In this film, we see the rise of  the personal computer from two of most important players of the era, and  along the way, we are shown how deeply power and wealth corrupts.  Those of  us that lived through this period are well acquainted with the first  personal computers.  Indeed, many of us have heard enough rumors concerning  Steve Jobs' late night tantrums as he walked the halls of his empire, to  know that this film depicted both him and Steve Wozniac fairly honestly.  As far as the depiction of Bill Gates, there are those that agree and those  that disagree.  Obviously, artistic license was used on both sides.  Steve  Wozniac mentioned that he was surprised how accurately the movie portrayed  the personalities, but indicated they got many of the dates screwed up  (check his web site, he has many interesting comments concerning the  movie).As the title aptly suggests, both Steve and Bill gained their  initial fame not just from their own creative genius (although both are  considered geniuses), but as much from ""borrowing"" -- Jobs from Xerox PARC,  and Gates from Apple Computer.  And while that is the central theme of the  movie, it also points out the astonishing short-sightedness of top  corporate executives--HP (unfairly in reality) and IBM for not realizing  the potential of the personal computer and software for the masses, and  Xerox for not understanding what they themselves had developed.  One of the  best lines comes from an HP exec talking to Steve Wozniac (the creator of  the Apple computer)...  ""Why would the average person ever want a  computer?"" (I'm paraphrasing here--and I think in reality, it was IBM who  had this attitude).In fairness, back in those days computers were used  mainly by scientists, the military, and mathematicians.  These things were  gigantic and cost a fortune.  Still, it makes me think that the trillions  of dollars lost by some of these giant corporations sprang from an immense  lack of imagination at key positions (I doubt any of those people ever  opened a science-fiction novel).  To Jobs' credit, he understood  immediately what he was shown at the Xerox PARC center, and the rest, as  they say, is history.""Pirates"" works on many levels, and it really is a  fascinating movie, however, I think it bit off a little more than it could  chew.  This movie is only 100 minutes long (or thereabouts), yet tries to  encompass 25 years of creation, in-fighting, slight-of-hand, and lying,  with a blend of madness and out-and-out theft thrown in.  It also has a  tendency to stray from its theme, trying (and failing) in its depiction of  the main characters' personal lives.

35663,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,0780627717,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 2]","PIRATES OF SILICON VALLEY (1999, Writ./Dir. Martyne Burke, based on the nonfiction bookFire in the Valley: The Making of The Personal Computer (Second Edition)by Paul Freiberger and Michael Swaine, 95 minutes, for TNT, The Turner Network) was one of those fun, in some ways awesome TV films that nobody missed - everybody caught it, got it, grooved to it. Then everybody forgot about it. Even I took all these years to review it ... and it took this company until 2004 to get on DVD.A still-pencil-thin Anthony Michael Hall shines in the role of a young Bill Gates, all spotty and twitchy fun. As we watch him goof off at Harvard, eventually dropping out to advance himself in computers, we follow the odious backstory of Steve Jobs (a creepy twinlike performance by Noah Wyle, who actually fooled a live audience into thinking he was Jobs, at the 1999 Macworld Conference).Joey Slotnick plays a less-than-schlubby Steve Wozniak - which I found refreshing and a humorous role. Wozniak is likeable enough in real life for everyone to cheer him on, and was the only one smart enough to cash out and live the good life. Wayne P&eacute;re pops in and plays my legendary hero ""Captain Crunch"" (the dude who taught me how to telephone hack, back when ""hacker"" meant you hacked phones for fun). My immortal favorite Gailard Sartain, THE most underrated and underappreciated actor in history, plays the legendary Ed Roberts, the inventor of the Altair computer which Gates stole from him.Some of the best scenes in the film are the interactions between Hall and Sartain - the two are perfect together and somehow each enhances the other's acting. Sartain never got this far with Jim Varney in the ""Ernest"" movies. This film has always been touted as ""the history of Apple and Microsoft"" and that's true enough. However, it is much more. Jobs comes off as an odious, sociopathic phony and Gates as a thrill-addicted autistic gambler who cannot stop taunting life, daring life to come and get him. In other words, excellent biographical value and psychological insight.Hall is absolutely chilling in that legendary face-to-face Gates had with Jobs all those years ago. I don't know how Hall does it, but he uses those eyes and absolutely drills into a helpless Noah Wyle. Or IS he helpless? Another chilling matched-set scene is when Wyle turns to Hall and says something about them both being like burglars, except, Wyle says, ""I come in and see you there already."" I tell you, it gave me shivers. Not just any film does that ... I am nearly shiver-proof.So there's my review. You cannot miss owning this film no matter who you are or what you dream. This is a historical document, and I do not say that only because Jobs is now deceased. This will tell you the history of the 21st century computer and the men who invented it all from scratch. You'll witness the founding of both Microsoft and Apple, that is true, but the history you will witness far outweighs the sum of its parts.One thing this made me itch to see one more time is ""Captain Crunch"" blow that Captain Crunch whistle into the telephone, man oh man ....",5,"One must have the patience of Jobs to reach the pearly Gates, says the Book of Wozniak",1350777600,"10 21, 2012",2012,3112,"['PIRATES', 'SILICON', 'VALLEY', '1999', 'Writ./Dir', 'Martyne', 'Burke', 'based', 'nonfiction', 'bookFire', 'Valley', 'Making', 'Personal', 'Computer', 'Second', 'Edition', 'Paul', 'Freiberger', 'Michael', 'Swaine', '95', 'minutes', 'TNT', 'Turner', 'Network', 'was', 'one', 'fun', 'ways', 'awesome', 'TV', 'films', 'nobody', 'missed', 'everybody', 'caught', 'got', 'grooved', 'Then', 'everybody', 'forgot', 'Even', 'took', 'years', 'review', 'took', 'company', '2004', 'get', 'DVD.A', 'still-pencil-thin', 'Anthony', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'shines', 'role', 'young', 'Bill', 'Gates', 'spotty', 'twitchy', 'fun', 'watch', 'goof', 'off', 'Harvard', 'eventually', 'dropping', 'out', 'advance', 'computers', 'follow', 'odious', 'backstory', 'Steve', 'Jobs', 'creepy', 'twinlike', 'performance', 'Noah', 'Wyle', 'who', 'actually', 'fooled', 'live', 'audience', 'thinking', 'was', 'Jobs', '1999', 'Macworld', 'Conference', '.Joey', 'Slotnick', 'less-than-schlubby', 'Steve', 'Wozniak', 'found', 'refreshing', 'humorous', 'role', 'Wozniak', 'likeable', 'enough', 'real', 'life', 'everyone', 'cheer', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'smart', 'enough', 'cash', 'out', 'live', 'good', 'life', 'Wayne', 'P', 'eacute', 're', 'pops', 'plays', 'legendary', 'hero', 'Captain', 'Crunch', 'dude', 'who', 'taught', 'how', 'telephone', 'hack', 'back', 'when', 'hacker', 'meant', 'hacked', 'phones', 'fun', 'immortal', 'favorite', 'Gailard', 'Sartain', 'THE', 'most', 'underrated', 'underappreciated', 'actor', 'history', 'legendary', 'Ed', 'Roberts', 'inventor', 'Altair', 'computer', 'stole', 'him.Some', 'best', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'interactions', 'Hall', 'Sartain', 'two', 'are', 'perfect', 'together', 'somehow', 'other', 'acting', 'Sartain', 'never', 'got', 'far', 'Jim', 'Varney', 'Ernest', 'movies', 'film', 'always', 'been', 'touted', 'history', 'Apple', 'Microsoft', 'true', 'enough', 'However', 'much', 'more', 'Jobs', 'off', 'odious', 'sociopathic', 'phony', 'Gates', 'thrill-addicted', 'autistic', 'gambler', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'taunting', 'life', 'daring', 'life', 'come', 'get', 'other', 'words', 'excellent', 'biographical', 'value', 'psychological', 'insight.Hall', 'absolutely', 'chilling', 'legendary', 'face-to-face', 'Gates', 'had', 'Jobs', 'years', 'ago', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'Hall', 'eyes', 'absolutely', 'helpless', 'Noah', 'Wyle', 'helpless', 'chilling', 'matched-set', 'scene', 'when', 'Wyle', 'Hall', 'something', 'being', 'burglars', 'Wyle', 'come', 'see', 'there', 'already', 'tell', 'gave', 'shivers', 'Not', 'just', 'film', 'am', 'nearly', 'shiver-proof.So', 'review', 'can', 'not', 'miss', 'owning', 'film', 'matter', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'dream', 'historical', 'document', 'do', 'not', 'say', 'only', 'Jobs', 'now', 'deceased', 'will', 'tell', 'history', '21st', 'century', 'computer', 'men', 'who', 'invented', 'scratch', ""'ll"", 'witness', 'founding', 'Microsoft', 'Apple', 'true', 'history', 'will', 'witness', 'far', 'sum', 'parts.One', 'thing', 'made', 'itch', 'see', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'Captain', 'Crunch', 'blow', 'Captain', 'Crunch', 'whistle', 'telephone', 'man', 'oh', 'man']",N/A

Though, Pirates really shows its age today. Keep in mind that when this was made in 1999, there was no iPod or OS X, and the iMac hadn't been available long enough to show any sort of turnaround for Apple.Also at the time, Microsoft's plagues of security vulnerabilities and missed product deadlines were rarely published in mainstream media. So with all things considered, it's interesting to see this again, with today's perspective.As far as the DVD goes, it's pretty sparse on extras (a 5 minute clip of Noah W. and a trailer), and perhaps more disappointingly, is displayed in 4:3.

Even now, most of this made-for-television movie is your traditional rags-to-riches story as we follow Steve Jobs (Noah Wyle) and Bill Gates (Anthony Michael Hall) as they create the computer revolution.  You think it is David vs. Goliath, but then it becomes clear the opponents here are dinosaurs.  However, in the end, the heroes have become the monsters, which makes for an unsatisfying conclusion: what lesson do we learn from the story of these two guys?  Ultimately, the American success story here is sullied by the dark ending (reinforced by headlines about the government's concerted effort to break up Microsoft).  However, since I know nothing about computers, I found myself more interested in how Apple and Microsoft were able to rise to power and less concerned with the flawed nature of the characters.  Director Martyn Burke's script keeps the characters and events at a distance, so even our natural inclinations at empathy towards the main characters is worn down over the course of the film.  Instead of rooting for Jobs and Gates we end up having the most sympathy for their respective sidekicks, Steve Wozniak (Joey Slotnick) and Steve Ballmer (John DiMaggio).  After all, the pair get to do the voice-over narrations and halfway through you realize they are the better human beings than their fearless leaders.  This also hurts the film, because you end up being more interested in &quot;Dr. Watson&quot; (i.e., the storyteller), than in the heroes.  The choice of lead actors also becomes problematic because you have that nice Dr. Carter from &quot;E.R.&quot; versus the geek from &quot;The Breakfast Club,&quot; &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; and many other movies.  Of course, since Bill Gates is admittedly richer than God and Macintosh has gone back to meaning a type of red fruit, that probably helps balance things out a bit.

Noah Wiley not only looks like Steve Jobs, but does a beautiful job of taking on an unusually complex character. Love him or hate him, you can see why people are willing to put up with him as long as it takes to change the world. The big problem with the story is that it is incomplete. It ends at the point when Microsoft and Apple joined forces, and skims over what came after only by a few years. Anthony Michael Hall is so creepy as Bill Gates- and rightly so - that it leaves him looking smug and dominant. I don't care how much money he has, Jobs is the one with the vision.Since this movie was made, Jobs created Pixar Studios, which makes cutting-edge animated films, and has introduced the world to the iPod and now the iPhone. In doing so, he has revitalized the music industry and forever changed the way people relate to their music collections. TheiPod videohas changed the way we watch TV - who ever imagined having a whole season of your favorite show in your pocket, to watch where ever you are?! The iPhone is already changing the telecommunications business, and the big wireless companies are scrambling to to keep up with Jobs' newest, greatest cell phone/music player/Movie viewer/photo album/camera/web browser/address book/and mini computer, but no one can touch it or him.

No actor will ever do justice to all the odd quirks that make a Bill Gates or a Steve Jobs among others.  The best any actor can do is give you an impression of the people they portray.  The history of how todays IT industry and its mega-corporation titans came to be can not really be distilled into a simple hours long DVD.  Everyone's a critic including me.  Some people would have made different choices as to what this DVD should have included and what should have been left on the cutting room floor.  Pirates of Silicon Valley was and is a bold attempt to make the history that gave birth to the information age fun to watch for mainstream folks who do not live and breathe computer jargon.  I know it is hard to look at Bill Gates today and think of him as a kid with big dreams but, in his youth he was not a GOD!  These were brilliant inspired geniuses with big egos and larger than life personalities.  These guys were computer nerds with the passion to follow their dreams to their logical ends.  Pirates of Silicon Valley has its flaws as did those whose lives it attempts to portray.  Pirates of Silicon Valley suggests that motives in the early computer industry were not always virtuous and pure a situation that endures today.  Pirates of Silicon Valley is a fun look into the birth of the Information Technology age that manages to take what could have been a dull dry subject and spices it up without straying too far from the truth.  Acting is an art and art is always subject to interpretation of the artist a fact never lost to an autistic guy like me who works and slaves to act normal each day.  Hey I have been trying to act normal for over 50 years and have not got it right yet but; I keep trying.  Every day I haul myself out of bed and go to work in buildings filled to the brim with neurotypicals who find flaws in my portrayal of a normal person.  Do I give up nope.  Am I perfect nope.  Am I good enough to make it through the day and get a paycheck every two weeks yeap because; unlike others who just criticize I try.  Oh yeah anyone can say Pirates of Silicon Valley does not do justice to the founders of Apple, Microsoft, 3Com, Oracle and others but so many who cricticize actors never know just how hard it is to act.  I enjoyed Pirates of Silicon Valley because; it offers a fun historical perspective on the birth of the home computer a device that continues to mutate, grow and revolutionize our lives in almost every way!",5,YOU CAN NO MORE CAPTURE GENIUS IN A BOTTLE THAN YOU CAN CAPTURE THE ESSENCE OF PERSONALITY!,1358640000,"01 20, 2013",2013,2577,"['People', 'who', 'founded', 'tech', 'giants', 'Microsoft', 'Apple', 'are', 'unique', 'personalities', 'most', 'unusual', 'bent', 'actor', 'will', 'ever', 'do', 'justice', 'odd', 'quirks', 'make', 'Bill', 'Gates', 'Steve', 'Jobs', 'others', 'best', 'actor', 'can', 'do', 'give', 'impression', 'people', 'portray', 'history', 'how', 'todays', 'IT', 'industry', 'mega-corporation', 'titans', 'came', 'be', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'be', 'distilled', 'simple', 'hours', 'long', 'DVD', 'Everyone', 'critic', 'including', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'different', 'choices', 'what', 'DVD', 'should', 'have', 'included', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'Pirates', 'Silicon', 'Valley', 'was', 'bold', 'attempt', 'make', 'history', 'gave', 'birth', 'information', 'age', 'fun', 'watch', 'mainstream', 'folks', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'live', 'breathe', 'computer', 'jargon', 'know', 'hard', 'look', 'Bill', 'Gates', 'today', 'think', 'kid', 'big', 'dreams', 'youth', 'was', 'not', 'GOD', 'were', 'brilliant', 'inspired', 'geniuses', 'big', 'egos', 'larger', 'life', 'personalities', 'guys', 'were', 'computer', 'nerds', 'passion', 'follow', 'dreams', 'logical', 'ends', 'Pirates', 'Silicon', 'Valley', 'flaws', 'did', 'lives', 'portray', 'Pirates', 'Silicon', 'Valley', 'motives', 'early', 'computer', 'industry', 'were', 'not', 'always', 'virtuous', 'pure', 'situation', 'today', 'Pirates', 'Silicon', 'Valley', 'fun', 'look', 'birth', 'Information', 'Technology', 'age', 'take', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'dull', 'dry', 'subject', 'spices', 'up', 'straying', 'too', 'far', 'truth', 'Acting', 'art', 'art', 'always', 'subject', 'interpretation', 'artist', 'fact', 'never', 'lost', 'autistic', 'guy', 'who', 'act', 'normal', 'day', 'Hey', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'act', 'normal', '50', 'years', 'have', 'not', 'got', 'right', 'yet', 'keep', 'trying', 'day', 'haul', 'bed', 'go', 'work', 'buildings', 'filled', 'brim', 'neurotypicals', 'who', 'find', 'flaws', 'portrayal', 'normal', 'person', 'Do', 'give', 'up', 'nope', 'Am', 'perfect', 'nope', 'Am', 'good', 'enough', 'make', 'day', 'get', 'paycheck', 'two', 'weeks', 'yeap', 'others', 'who', 'just', 'criticize', 'try', 'Oh', 'anyone', 'can', 'say', 'Pirates', 'Silicon', 'Valley', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'founders', 'Apple', 'Microsoft', '3Com', 'Oracle', 'others', 'so', 'many', 'who', 'cricticize', 'actors', 'never', 'know', 'just', 'how', 'hard', 'act', 'enjoyed', 'Pirates', 'Silicon', 'Valley', 'fun', 'historical', 'perspective', 'birth', 'home', 'computer', 'device', 'mutate', 'grow', 'revolutionize', 'lives', 'almost', 'way']",N/A

35711,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,0780627717,V. Berk,"[0, 0]","Pirates of Silicon Valley is an interesting dramatization of the rise of Steve Jobs and Apple tied in with Bill Gates and Microsoft.  As could be expected in a movie about business, it is full of theft, double crosses, and extreme personalities.  It all culminates in the unveiling of the Macintosh and the Windows 1.0 operating system.The reoccurring theme of the film is that giants should never underestimate upstart competition.  IBM and HP failed to see  the future in personal computers which allowed Apple to start a revolution.  Steve Jobs when meeting Bill Gates doesn't see any threat in a small software company, and sees no value in selling an operating system to multiple manufacturers.  This idea will always be relevant, especially in a constantly expanding market such as technology.Both lead actors provide workable portrayals of these giants in the techworld.  Noah Wyle as Steve Jobs is a manic force that degrades anyone who doesn't conform to his vision.  Anthony Michael Hall as Bill Gates captures a computer genius and cunning business man who calculates every move.  Both performances show the good and bad sides of these two men's personalities and business practices.  These performances I feel perfectly represent what each man had been striving for: Jobs has an obsession with making art, starting with hardware, while Gates was most concerned with software, and getting a computer in every home.The greatest determent to Pirates of Silicon Valley is its relatively short running time.  Key events are covered, but not examined.  We see a key moment in Apple or Microsoft's history and then immediately cut to the next event.  One minute Bill Gates is looking at Apple's Lisa computer and then immediately afterward Bill Gates is joining Jobs to look at the Macintosh.  This movie would have you believe this was Jobs and Gates' first meeting if not for a throwaway line at a convention where Gates tries to speak to Jobs by saying ""We wrote some programs for your Apple II"" and Jobs doesn't even acknowledge him.  More time should have been spent on interactions between these characters, because whenever they do meet the movie shines.If this had been a miniseries, or been 2.5-3 hours long it could have been much better.  As it is, Pirates of Silicon Valley is still a must see for anyone interested in the history of Apple and Microsoft.

Most ""based on a true story"" movies are trite and nothing more than exploitation. Ripped from the headlines movies using someone's suffering or crime as a ratings getter. Pure crap!I must say however, that Pirates Of Silicon Valley is brilliant. Every aspect of the movie appeals to me. It's visual style, it's pacing, it's characters, it's humor, and most engrossing, it's history. I knew much of the parallels between Bill Gates and Steve Jobs already and was pleasantly surprised to see much of the facts faithfully reproduced. The parts that were inaccurate were obviously for entertainment value, but they did fit the theme of the story and are forgivable (it is a movie after all).The film makers were very original for two reasons. First, for focusing on the more interesting moments of computer history. Second for the brutally honest look at the two pivotal character's lives and personalities, they aren't depicted nicely. The movie flows from moment to moment, historical event to historical event, over the course of two decades, following the exploits of the two most influential men of the computer industry. We see thier origins, their beginning ventures in the industry, thier major deals, thier double-crosses and shady conquests, thier flaws, thier bad judgement, and ultimatley thier confrontation.My favorite moments come from the bonehead mistakes that are made by the corporate types. IBM allowing Microsoft to retain ownership of DOS, Xerox not developing its own inventions (the mouse and the GUI), HP not even wanting ownership of the apple, and the biggest mistake of them all, Steve Jobs trusting Bill Gates.I absolutely love this movie, and the only negative thing about it is that it doesn't exist in DVD format.

Still, it was entertaining and I'm guessing most of it is fact based.Jobs and Gates are two very different people in personality. Jobs seems more creative and Gates more logical. Both are power hungry and will get it by any means. Lots of subterfuge. But Jobs bothered me more because of the way he treated his girlfriend and his daughter by her. I couldn't understand how he could be so cold toward them. Especially considering his own background. I don't want to reveal too much in case anyone chooses to watch this film.Anyway, I do recommend this. It doesn't matter if you know much about computers or not. It's about how they built their empires and them as people.",4,Above average movie,1154736000,"08 5, 2006",2006,930,"['was', 'made', 'TNT', '1999', 'never', 'surprise', 'how', 'good', 'most', 'cable', 'movies', 'are', 'exception', 'Noah', 'Wyle', 'Steve', 'Jobs', 'Anthony', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'Bill', 'Gates', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'much', 'movie', 'true', 'based', 'book', 'Still', 'was', 'entertaining', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'most', 'fact', 'based.Jobs', 'Gates', 'are', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'people', 'personality', 'Jobs', 'more', 'creative', 'more', 'logical', 'are', 'power', 'hungry', 'will', 'get', 'means', 'Lots', 'subterfuge', 'Jobs', 'bothered', 'more', 'way', 'treated', 'girlfriend', 'daughter', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'cold', 'Especially', 'considering', 'own', 'background', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'reveal', 'too', 'much', 'case', 'anyone', 'watch', 'film.Anyway', 'do', 'recommend', ""n't"", 'matter', 'know', 'much', 'computers', 'not', 'how', 'built', 'empires', 'people']",N/A

This film is so far the only thing I have noted along the way that even tried to touch on the computer wars at the beginning. TNT produced this film back in 1999 as one of its first original movie shows.  Its good drama, and really got me interested in looking at the interesting history of computer development. Yes it's kinda nerdy, but hey, I think everybody has to admit it, Apple/Macintosh has always been a more reliable/stable system, very hard to crash. Why the heck then did the IBM/microsoft platform take off as it did?  Well, this movie only touches on it. Noah Wyle plays the outlandish Steve Jobes, who was co founder of Apple with Steve Woznyack.  This movie illistrates his control in the company, but only touches how Apple's priprietary protection/isolation killed its strong foothold on the market, while the IBM/IBM clone market skyrocketed secondary to competition keeping computer price and software down while Microsoft, the little program maker, rake in the money from lisencing it's software.  Is this really how Steve Jobes and Bill gates (anthony michael hall) are in real life, I don't think so, but hey, its still a decent movie. Check it out if you like this kind of history.",4,"Decent TNT original movie,  nice brief stroll through computer history.",1180483200,"05 30, 2007",2007,1322,"['computer', 'revolution', 'change', 'everything', 'past', '30', 'hope', 'someday', 'good', 'documentary', 'will', 'be', 'available', 'film', 'so', 'far', 'only', 'thing', 'have', 'noted', 'way', 'even', 'tried', 'touch', 'computer', 'wars', 'beginning', 'TNT', 'produced', 'film', 'back', '1999', 'one', 'first', 'original', 'movie', 'shows', 'good', 'drama', 'really', 'got', 'interested', 'looking', 'interesting', 'history', 'computer', 'development', 'Yes', 'kinda', 'nerdy', 'hey', 'think', 'everybody', 'admit', 'Apple/Macintosh', 'always', 'been', 'more', 'reliable/stable', 'system', 'very', 'hard', 'crash', 'Why', 'heck', 'then', 'did', 'IBM/microsoft', 'platform', 'take', 'off', 'did', 'Well', 'movie', 'only', 'Noah', 'Wyle', 'outlandish', 'Steve', 'Jobes', 'who', 'was', 'co', 'founder', 'Apple', 'Steve', 'Woznyack', 'movie', 'control', 'company', 'only', 'how', 'Apple', 'priprietary', 'protection/isolation', 'killed', 'strong', 'foothold', 'market', 'IBM/IBM', 'clone', 'market', 'skyrocketed', 'secondary', 'competition', 'keeping', 'computer', 'price', 'software', 'down', 'Microsoft', 'little', 'program', 'maker', 'rake', 'money', 'lisencing', 'software', 'really', 'how', 'Steve', 'Jobes', 'Bill', 'gates', 'anthony', 'michael', 'hall', 'are', 'real', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'hey', 'still', 'decent', 'movie', 'Check', 'out', 'like', 'kind', 'history']",N/A
