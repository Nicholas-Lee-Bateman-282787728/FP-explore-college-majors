591929,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005JKWM,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[8, 8]","Sadly, I am a sucker for films that nearly everyone has knocked over backwards.  I want to discover, myself, if these occasionally hidden cinematic gems are still hiding or if big corporate Hollywood has just smeared them enough to nearly wipe them out of film existence.  With ""Crossroads"", there was enough plague surrounding it that friends nearly shunned me for weeks knowing that this film was in my house, more-so in my DVD player.  Yet, I found persistence, and I watched with open eyes - twice actually, so that I can fully develop the sheer strength that ""Crossroads"" had to offer.  Well, friends, Romans, and fellow cinephiles out there, I can now officially add ""Crossroads"" to the list of horrid films that everyone quivers over yet has actually never seen.  I have seen ""Crossroads"", and I can stand up on a soapbox and announce that it is not the horrid trash everyone speaks about, but it also isn't worth the film it is printed on.  This was a cookie-cutter film, produced by Hollywood to benefit the distribution of CD sales and promote the already growing popularity of one Britney Spears.  This was not a film, but a platform from Ms. Spears, and by listening to the commentary, you begin to realize the power that this young girl once had - I stress the word ""once"".  Now, two kids and several tabloids later, I am not sure that this film could even see the light of day.To begin, because that is always a good starting point with films of this nature, I must take a step forward and say that the acting wasn't excruciating, but it was painful.  It was obvious that our three leads, Spears, Saldana, and Manning, were quickly becoming strong friends - and that friendship translated well onto the screen, but it was their individual stories and accomplishments that created the pain.  In one scene, we saw this trio as little girls - friends without a care in the world - then instantly we are pushed into the awkward high school dark ages where nobody is friends with anyone.  Riffs have been issued, and we are asked to rediscover who these characters are again.  Matching them with their young counterparts is easy, but when their mouths open, it is another world all together.  Spears leads with a hodgepodge of different characteristics.  She dances sensually in her bedroom, unrobes nonchalantly in front of her lab partner, but is most avid about doing the right thing when it comes to morality and truthfulness.  There is even one scene where she hangs up on her father, no doubtably instilling the correct visions into her impressionable teen fan base.  She couldn't give us a straight character to save her life.  Coupled with the annoying Zoe Saldana who tries the hardest of the group, but cannot seem to quite understand the life surrounding her.  Then, painful to write, there is Taryn Manning (who gets better with each film) using every clich&eacute; redneck white-trash persona possible to define her character.  It isn't bad enough that we have Spears fading in and out of her ""real"" character that to have Manning use ""y'all"" like it is Shakespeare - yikes.  Again, the acting isn't bad (I have seen far, far, far worse), but it isn't Juliard - closer to flunking out of Acting 101.I have mediocre respect for director Tamra Davis.  The woman that gave us the hysterical and near cult-classic ""Billy Madison"" as well as ""Half-Baked"", has also turned out slow duds like ""Gun Crazy"" and, surprise, ""Crossroads"".  Her talent seems to be all over the place instead of choosing projects that will continue to define her.  Listening to the commentary, it felt she did this to 1) work with Spears, 2) she needed the rent money, and 3) it was an all girl cast - her youthfulness will be returned.  Not exactly the typical reasons artist create on a blank slate.  With Davis, I wanted humor, darkness, or anything that would make me remember why I loved ""Madison"" or ""Half-Baked' - ANYTHING - there was nothing.  Did I expect it with ""Crossroads"", probably not, but it would have been nice to see something that was uniquely hers.  Road movies are made weekly, and it is those road films that try to bring something new to the genre that stand out and bring more to the table.  Wasn't ""Billy Madison"" just a take-off of ""Back to School""?  I just question the ability of Davis without a studio baking and thankfully she has taken her raw, rotten talent to television only to further infuse the masses.We are left with nothing more than the story.  What story did ""Crossroads"" tell?  How about one lone girl's quest to find herself and loose her virginity?  Does that sound right?  Again, this wasn't rocket science writing, yet it seemed amateur from the first word.  We know who Spears' love interest is going to be from the beginning, the ""take"" at the end is given away within the first twenty minutes, and the only strength to this entire film is a scene with Dan Aykroyd saying ""I was a Ghostbuster, a Blues Brother, and Conehead - I did this film for my kids"".  I believe that sums up this whole story in a nutshell.  Needless to say, the story lacked any depth, and there was one scene where we attempted to bring real life to the screen with a rape, an accidental death, and our old friend, ""underage drinking"".  Thankfully, Spears could push beyond all this and finally sing her songs near the end, the obvious finale to the film that was started.  The ending point didn't match with the starting point in this film.So, I watched this film.  Everyone will have to at one point in their life, I just shortened the inevitable.  Again, it wasn't the worst film ever made, ""Glitter"" still ranks below this, but there wasn't any value in the final performance.  Spears didn't push for this film to be made because she wanted to be an actress, she wanted more face time with an audience that seemed on the fence about her ability - and as time has shown, we didn't make the best assumption.  The acting wasn't horrible, but everything else was so we are left with a sour taste in our mouth coming from all directions.  I will not, nor suggest this film to anyone except my wife, who thought it was better than ""Clerks II"".Ouch.  I will end on that note.Grade: ** out of *****",2,"Crossroads: Business in the front, Party in the back....",1178668800,"05 9, 2007",2007,6207,"['Sadly', 'am', 'sucker', 'films', 'nearly', 'everyone',

591930,A2GSRIHX7VIIK9,B00005JKWM,"Amazon Customer ""douggw""","[0, 0]","This was a surprisingly entertaining movie for her debut and shows Britney can act very well.  She has real talent and potential as an actress.  Will do well with stronger material.  Movie deals with 3 high school graduate (girls) on a roadtrip from Georgia to California (and/or Arizona) to deal with different issues, riding with a guy who has been in jail.  Crossroads was obviously developed to plug Britney and her latest album.  If you can put those issues aside, you can enjoy the performances of quite talented actors.  If you can not accept this is (in part) a Britney marketing tool, do not buy.The plot for Crossroads was predictable but avoided most (but not all) of the mistakes of fluffy &quot;teen&quot; movies.  There was enough depth to make it an interesting watch.  My major criticism is the poor continuity between many of the scenes, but l guess it was low budget so they could not fix everything.  Why did they not take the interstate? Obviously because they would not have had the nice scenery, which was beautifully presented, but the choice of route should have been built into the plot.  I though the ending was worth waiting for, very nicely done. I recommend the DVD extras, especially the Making of Crossroads and music videos.  Despite whether you are a Britney fan or not, the interviews with her are a fascinating look at someone who is VERY VERY successful.Overall, it was a surprisingly good (but far from great) movie and can be enjoyed by both young and older folk (good date movie).

591932,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JKWM,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I know, I know; it's Britney Spears and so any self respecting film lover is supposed to instantly ignore this pre-ordained disaster.  I tried, but a friend of mine and his wife rented this while I was at their house, and so I kind of had to watch it (and I will admit that curiosity had me intrigued).  When the closing credits (accompanied by Spears' balladry) began to roll I found myself doubting what I was feeling.Did I really just enjoy that movie?The films plot seems a little generic, and at times it is, but it also has a layer of grit that I didn't expect.  You have three friends who really aren't that close anymore.  Lucy is a goody-two-shoes who is `saving herself' and lives with an overprotective father.  Mimi wants to be a singer, but is saddled with a baby in the belly.  Kit is almost too good for her `former' friends, and seems to hold a major grudge against Mimi.  After they graduate they take a road trip so that Mimi can get a record deal (or at least try to get one).  Along the way they pick up a `hot' guy.That's kind of the basic plot, but there is surprising depth sprinkled in here and there that make this feel rather fresh.I'll be one of the first to admit that the idea of Britney Spears acting made my stomach hurt a bit.  I mean, she can barely sing (come on, you know it's true) and so the idea of her tackling another `artistic' venture seemed like a wasted effort.  I'm shocked to say that her performance has a real dynamic I wasn't expecting.  She feels natural here and surprisingly warm.  I believe her.  Taryn Manning has had me wrapped around her finger since I saw her follow Dunst around like a puppy dog in `Crazy/Beautiful' and I still adore her.  She isn't exceptionally strong here, but she works.  Zoe Saldana is gorgeous to look at, and she has honed her talent a considerable amount in recent years (she was best in show in that `Avatar' mess, and she animated) but here she is rather token and clich&eacute;d.Don't let the cover fool you, this isn't the atrocity it could have been.  Yes, Britney Spears sings (of course she has to).  I was rather disappointed with the script shrugging off Manning's talent (vocally) in order to capitalize on Spears, but whatever.

591937,A3HTX1NOTTWERP,B00005JKWM,Busy Body,"[3, 4]","Crossroads was released at cinemas worldwide in April 2002 and was a fairly big hit; the film peaked at No.2 in the US and No.4 in the UK, making $40 million and 5 million in each country respectively. Total worldwide earning topped the $100 million mark - and what was the factor that made all this money? The answer, plain and simple, is Britney Spears. Crossroads proves further more what a superb money-maker Britney Spears is. One can only wonder how much cash Jive Records have made out of her concert tickets and records sales since 1999. I don't think you'd be considered a fool if we were talking hundreds of millions of dollars - maybe billions. I bought this film in November 2002 when I saw it advertised at No.1 in UK VHS chart. I was going to get it for Christmas but couldn't be bothered waiting so long! I scurried home with my mates and watched the film - for the next hour and a half, it was Britney Bliss for me!Crossroads begins with three young girls, Lucy (Britney Spears), Mimi (Taryn Manning) and Kit (Zoe Saldana). The three are all about 10 years old and the best of friends. They decide to bury their ""box of dreams"" one night and made a pact to dig to up at midnight on the night of their high school graduation. Eight years on and graduation day is fast approaching. The three girls have since fallen out and grown apart. They all have different friends and different outlooks on life; Lucy is a real daddy's girl, Mimi is a tom boy and Kit is self-obssessed about her looks and one of the most popular girls in the school. At midnight on graduation day, they all reluctantly arrive at the spot where they buried their ""box of dreams."" Lucy digs up the soil in her high heels and prom dress (like you do!) and sift through their personal items they placed in there eight years previously. Lucy wants to meet her mum - Sex And The City's Samantha (Kim Catrall) who abandoned her and her father (Dan Ackroyd) when she was only three, Kit wants to meet up with her boyfriend who she plans to marry next year and Mimi is auditioning for a record deal. Lucy and Kit agree to tag along with Mimi on a road trip across the US, not knowing they will re-discover the friendship they lost almost a decade ago. Their driver is Ben (Anson Mount), a hunky sex-god who Lucy falls for instantly, but doesn't let on until much later in the movie. Along with $486, a crumbling car and a whole lot of dreams, they set off on a road-trip of a lifetime to re-discover, re-kindle and re-evaluate their friendships and lives...The thing that I liked most about Crossroads was the way songs are mixed into the movie. The three girls sing in the car along with songs such as N'Sync's Bye Bye Bye, Sheryl Crowe's If It Makes You Happy and Shania Twain's Man! I Feel Like A Woman! When Lucy's on her own, she sings Madonna's Open Your Heart in just her underwear at the start of the film (a high point for many a male viewer!) and Britney's massive hits I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman, Overprotected and I Love Rock 'N' Roll are all worked into the film by means of karaoke singing and diary writing. The director (Tamra Davis) knows Britney Spears is the star of the film and makes sure you remember that fact, as Lucy seems to get the most attention and camera-time. Many people complain that the film is too unsuitable for children, the main audience that the film is directed towards. Lucy plans to lose her virginity on her prom night with Henry (Justin Long), but realises she should do it with someone she feels comfortable with and when she actually feels ready - not just to prove a point to the entire high school population. Many people fail to realise that this makes a point in itself. It's telling young girls that they should save themselves for someone they love. Romance beckons for Lucy and Ben as they share a kiss many a time. In the end, Lucy's dad comes to pick her up and the road-trip is over.OVERALL GRADE: 7/10Crossroads is a film that isn't based on the final outcome - it's more centered around the things that happen in-between such as re-discovered friendships. If you plan on watching the film for the final outcome, you'll be disappointed as you have to evaluate the points made on the way to a possible outcome - which in this case involves Lucy singing for a record company. The film has many funny bits that many teenage girls can definetly relate to. I'm a boy so I didn't quite understand all the stuff that goes on, but I did have my fair share of giggle-time! All in all, this is a thoroughly enjoyable film and a must for every Britney fan! This film is a basically a heart-felt chick flick which can be watched over and over again without getting too boring or repetitive.",4,A Worthwhile Film Debut From The Pop Icon,1051315200,"04 26, 2003",2003,4717,"['Crossroads', 'was', 'released', 'cinemas', 'worldwide', 'April', '2002', 'was', 'fairly', 'big', 'hit', 'film', 'peaked', 'No.2', 'US', 'No.4', 'UK', 'making', '40', 'million', '5', 'million', 'country', 'respectively', 'Total', 'earning', 'topped', '100', 'million', 'mark', 'was', 'factor', 'made', 'money', 'answer', 'plain', 'simple', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'Crossroads', 'further', 'more', 'what', 'superb', 'money-maker', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'cash', 'Jive', 'Records', 'have', 'made', 'concert', 'tickets', 'records', 'sales', '1999', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'considered', 'fool', 'were', 'talking', 'hundreds', 'millions', 'dollars', 'maybe', 'billions', 'bought', 'film', 'November', '2002', 'when', 'saw', 'advertised', 'No.1', 'UK', 'VHS', 'chart', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'Christmas', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'waiting', 'so', 'long', 'scurried', 'home', 'mates', 'watched', 'film', 'next', 'hour', 'half', 'was', 'Britney', 'Bliss', 'Crossroads', 'three', 'young', 'girls', 'Lucy', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'Mimi', 'Taryn', 'Manning', 'Kit', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'three', 'are', '10', 'years', 'old', 'best', 'friends', 'decide', 'bury', 'box', 'dreams', 'one', 'night', 'made', 'pact', 'dig', 'up', 'midnight', 'night', 'high', 'school', 'graduation', 'Eight', 'years', 'graduation', 'day', 'fast', 'approaching', 'three', 'girls', 'have', 'fallen', 'grown', 'apart', 'have', 'different', 'friends', 'different', 'outlooks', 'life', 'Lucy', 'real', 'daddy', 'girl', 'Mimi', 'tom', 'boy', 'Kit', 'self-obssessed', 'looks', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'girls', 'school', 'midnight', 'graduation', 'day', 'reluctantly', 'arrive', 'spot', 'where', 'buried', 'box', 'dreams', 'Lucy', 'up', 'soil', 'high', 'heels', 'prom', 'dress', 'do', 'personal', 'items', 'placed', 'eight', 'years', 'previously', 'Lucy', 'meet', 'mum', 'Sex', 'City', 'Samantha', 'Kim', 'Catrall', 'who', 'abandoned', 'father', 'Dan', 'Ackroyd', 'when', 'was', 'only', 'three', 'Kit', 'meet', 'up', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'marry', 'next', 'year', 'Mimi', 'auditioning', 'record', 'deal', 'Lucy', 'Kit', 'agree', 'tag', 'Mimi', 'road', 'trip', 'US', 'not', 'knowing', 'will', 're-discover', 'friendship', 'lost', 'almost', 'decade', 'ago', 'driver', 'Ben', 'Anson', 'Mount', 'hunky', 'sex-god', 'who', 'Lucy', 'instantly', ""n't"", 'let', 'much', 'later', 'movie', '486', 'crumbling', 'car', 'whole', 'lot', 'dreams', 'set', 'off', 'road-trip', 'lifetime', 're-discover', 're-kindle', 're-evaluate', 'friendships', 'lives', 'thing', 'liked', 'most', 'Crossroads', 'was', 'way', 'songs', 'are', 'mixed', 'movie', 'three', 'girls', 'sing', 'car', 'songs', 'such', ""N'Sync"", 'Bye', 'Bye', 'Bye', 'Sheryl', 'Crowe', 'Makes', 'Happy', 'Shania', 'Twain', 'Man', 'Feel', 'A', 'Woman', 'When', 'Lucy', 'own', 'Madonna', 'Open', 'Heart', 'just', 'underwear', 'start', 'film', 'high', 'point', 'many', 'male', 'viewer', 'Britney', 'massive', 'hits', ""'m"", 'Not', 'A', 'Girl', 'Not', 'Yet', 'A', 'Woman', 'Overprotected', 'Love', 'Rock', 'N', 'Roll', 'are', 'worked', 'film', 'means', 'karaoke', 'singing', 'diary', 'writing', 'director', 'Tamra', 'Davis', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'star', 'film', 'sure', 'remember', 'fact', 'Lucy', 'get', 'most', 'attention', 'camera-time', 'Many', 'people', 'complain', 'film', 'too', 'unsuitable', 'children', 'main', 'audience', 'film', 'directed', 'towards', 'Lucy', 'lose', 'virginity', 'prom', 'night', 'Henry', 'Justin', 'Long', 'should', 'do', 'someone', 'comfortable', 'when', 'actually', 'ready', 'not', 'just', 'prove', 'point', 'entire', 'high', 'school', 'population', 'Many', 'people', 'fail', 'realise', 'point', 'telling', 'young', 'girls', 'should', 'save', 'someone', 'love', 'Romance', 'beckons', 'Lucy', 'Ben', 'share', 'kiss', 'many', 'time', 'end', 'Lucy', 'dad', 'pick', 'up', 'road-trip', 'over.OVERALL', 'GRADE', '7/10Crossroads', 'film', ""n't"", 'based', 'final', 'outcome', 'more', 'centered', 'things', 'happen', 'in-between', 'such', 're-discovered', 'friendships', 'plan', 'watching', 'film', 'final', 'outcome', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'have', 'evaluate', 'points', 'made', 'way', 'possible', 'outcome', 'case', 'Lucy', 'singing', 'record', 'company', 'film', 'many', 'funny', 'bits', 'many', 'teenage', 'girls', 'can', 'definetly', 'relate', ""'m"", 'boy', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'stuff', 'did', 'have', 'fair', 'share', 'giggle-time', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'must', 'Britney', 'fan', 'film', 'basically', 'heart-felt', 'chick', 'flick', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'over', 'again', 'getting', 'too', 'boring', 'repetitive']",N/A

All with different reasons for going, the three girls set off on a roadtrip together.

I was expecting an average girl bonding film, but there is much more going on in this film than one is initally prepared for. There are hard issues covered here and there is not always a happy ending, but that is what helps this film from becoming another singer/movie ala Susanna Hoff's The Allnighter or Cool as Ice with Vanilla Ice. With Crossroads, Mandy Moore's A Walk to Remember and the upcoming Eminem film, it looks like the singers are prepared to take over the film screens and as long as the films are good, I say go for it.

This girl really does have ALOT of talent. Put aside every notion you've ever had of Britney and give this film a chance. It's a touching story about friendship and I don't know anyone who couldn't identify with the movie or it's characters at some point. Britney plays Lucy, an over achieving graduate who secretly aspires to become a singer even though her over bearing father expects her to be a doctor and stay in school. She decides to pursue one of her dreams which is to find her birth mother and plans a road trip with two girls, Kit and Mimi whom she used to be friends with when she was a child, but later had gone their seperate ways in high school. Kit is the snobby, pretentious, self centered one who's insecure at heart and Mimi is the eccentric, naive, pregnant one who doesn't think before she acts upon her crazy ideas. Case in point where she gets her friend Ben a supposed KILLER (!!) to drive them across the country. Along the way are some good times, some bad times, alot of heartache, disappointment and growing up. This movie is alot more touching and effective than it has been given credit for. Britney is great as the blossoming and maturing-before-our-eyes Lucy who's at a crossroads in her life trying to decide what is right for her. Mimi and Kit also add alot of heart and drama to the story going further into detail about Mimi's baby and Kit's insecurities. Don't be surprised if you shed a few tears during this movie and are rooting for Lucy, Mimi, Kit and Ben at the end of the film. Overall a really great movie with great acting, a beautiful and inspiring story/script, a wide variety of characters that anyone can relate to and some fun music. More of an inspiring drama with adult themes than a comedy (which is what the trailer makes the movie out to be), I wouldn't recommend letting anyone under the age of 13 watch this, but for everyone else I urge you to give this movie a chance because you'll be glad you went along for the ride and come out feeling like you made a whole new group of friends.",4,A Realistic Story About Friendship,1028332800,"08 3, 2002",2002,2254,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'completely', 'love', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'think', 'amazing', 'seeing', 'film', 'can', 'say', ""'ve"", 'honestly', 'seen', 'side', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'watch', 'movie', 'girl', 'really', 'have', 'ALOT', 'talent', 'Put', 'aside', 'notion', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'Britney', 'give', 'film', 'chance', 'touching', 'story', 'friendship', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'identify', 'movie', 'characters', 'point', 'Britney', 'Lucy', 'achieving', 'graduate', 'who', 'secretly', 'become', 'singer', 'even', 'bearing', 'father', 'be', 'doctor', 'stay', 'school', 'pursue', 'one', 'dreams', 'find', 'birth', 'mother', 'road', 'trip', 'two', 'girls', 'Kit', 'Mimi', 'whom', 'used', 'be', 'friends', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'later', 'had', 'gone', 'seperate', 'ways', 'high', 'school', 'Kit', 'snobby', 'pretentious', 'centered', 'one', 'who', 'insecure', 'heart', 'Mimi', 'eccentric', 'naive', 'pregnant', 'one', 'who', ""n't"", 'think', 'crazy', 'ideas', 'Case', 'point', 'where', 'friend', 'Ben', 'supposed', 'KILLER', 'drive', 'country', 'way', 'are', 'good', 'times', 'bad', 'times', 'alot', 'heartache', 'disappointment', 'growing', 'up', 'movie', 'alot', 'more', 'touching', 'effective', 'been', 'given', 'credit', 'Britney', 'great', 'blossoming', 'maturing-before-our-eyes', 'Lucy', 'who', 'crossroads', 'life', 'trying', 'decide', 'what', 'right', 'Mimi', 'Kit', 'also', 'add', 'alot', 'heart', 'drama', 'story', 'going', 'further', 'detail', 'Mimi', 'baby', 'Kit', 'insecurities', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'shed', 'few', 'tears', 'movie', 'are', 'rooting', 'Lucy', 'Mimi', 'Kit', 'Ben', 'end', 'film', 'Overall', 'really', 'great', 'movie', 'great', 'acting', 'beautiful', 'inspiring', 'story/script', 'wide', 'variety', 'characters', 'anyone', 'can', 'relate', 'fun', 'music', 'More', 'inspiring', 'drama', 'adult', 'themes', 'comedy', 'what', 'trailer', 'movie', 'be', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'letting', 'anyone', 'age', '13', 'watch', 'everyone', 'else', 'urge', 'give', 'movie', 'chance', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'went', 'along', 'ride', 'come', 'out', 'feeling', 'made', 'whole', 'new', 'group', 'friends']",N/A

Gaines,"[3, 4]","Britney Spears has made a movie.Depending on your gender, age bracket, and musical preferrence, that could be the best news in the world, or conversely, the worst. I'm not going to talk about Britney as a musician at all, because that's irrelevant to the film, really. I'll try my best to review the film without mentioning any Britney-isms that she has become so popular for.Britney's first movie is obviously a Glitter-esque movie: a vehical to display her as a ""serious"" actress and not as a pop ...-muffin. Well, it succeeds and it doesn't. I've noticed that in almost all movies that star musicians (Glitter, A Walk To Remember, Spiceworld...), the first shot of the artist is of them singing (or in Glitter's case, dancing). If you want an audience to see you as someone OTHER than a singer, don't start a film by singing. Seems to make sense, doesn't it?The movie itself is rather slow-moving, but is definetly a worthwhile story that is worth telling. The subplots involve a rape, uncaring mother, and a teen pregnancy. Of course, there are some moments that seem a little forced, for example, after a night of drinking, one of the characters says, ""I'm never doing THAT again!"" You can almost hear the mothers of America praising her for a breif second.The DVD extras are simply unbelievable. You can learn how to make T-Shirts (the parental advisory before this segment just confirms that, yes, they actually intend for children to wear the mini-mini-mini tops that they're creating), listen to audio commentary, watch Britney pop-up all over the film with her input, watch music videos, edit your own, and watch behind the scene footage of the Crossroads premiere.

591944,AE42JLYPXUI45,B00005JKWM,"Chad DeFeo ""(ChandlerBingFan)""","[2, 6]","Britney Spears seems to be following in Madonna's footsteps, but in her own unique way. Back in 1983 and 1984, Madonna became the freshest voice in music by releasing her first two albums. In 1985, Madonna became the freshest face in movies by starring in her first movie, DESPERATELY SEEKING SUSAN. Britney Spears in going down the same path. In 1999, Britney became the freshest voice in music and now's she become the freshest face in movies. This is her first starring role in a major film.Three ten year old girls named LUCY (Britney Spears), KIT (Zoe Saldana), and MIMI (Taryn Manning) had gotten a box and each put a wish into the box. They buried the box with the intention of digging it up on Midnight on the night of their High School graduation. LUCY put a locket in the box. The locket contained a picture of her and her mother. LUCY wished to find her mother. MIMI put in a keychain. The charm was a globe. MIMI wished to get out and see the world. KIT put in her Bride Barbie. KIT wished to become a bride. They vowed to be best friends forever, but unfortunately, that never happened.Eight years later, it is the dawn of their high school graduation. LUCY is a quiet person who wants get out and fun. She's very quiet because her father is been so overprotective in order to keep her from making the same mistake her mother made. MIMI is at times insecure, but very outgoing. She has enough street smarts to know what the world is like. She needs to be this way because she is now six months pregnant. This happened over Christmas Break. Her boyfriend blew her off just so he can hang out with his friends. MIMI had more than a few beers and a seemingly nice guy with a blue beer bottle offered her a ride home. The ride he had in mind was a bump in the back seat with MIMI. KIT is a very prissy, feminine girl, who happens to be the most popular in the whole school. MIMI seems to be the only one who wants to dig up the box. LUCY would have but has ""plans"" with her prom date, HENRY (played by Justin Long). KIT chooses not to go because she's too mature to do something childish. MIMI sets out on her own only to find KIT with a shovel. They both go looking for the spot until they find LUCY. They dig up the box and find their wishes. KIT's wish was to be a bride and her wish will be coming true. She's marrying her boyfriend Dylan. LUCY finds her wish and is still not sure if it's coming true yet. Her wish was to find her mother. MIMI finds her wish. Her wish was to see the world. Being that she's pregnant, LUCY and KIT don't think it will be coming true for awhile, but MIMI's going to make it happen. She gives the two a magazine article. It's an add for auditions for a record company in LA. MIMI asks LUCY and KIT to join her. KIT only goes so she could see DYLAN. LUCY goes along only to be dropped off in TUSCAN, ARIZONA so she could see her mother. They get a ride with BEN (ANSON MOUNT).By the third day, the car breaks down. KIT and MIMI become very bitter with each other, but MIMI's idea was the last chance the three had to becoming best friends again. They joined for a karaoke contest. Their performance of I LOVE ROCK 'N ROLL paid them enough money for the car and the trip. That night, the three became best friends again.They reached ARIZONA and let LUCY off in front of the house that belonged to her mother, CAROLINE (played by KIM CATRELL). Shocked to see her, Caroline invites LUCY in only to break her heart. Caroline said that she never wanted Lucy and that her father made her give birth. Lucy was just a mistake. So, she leaves and rejoins her friends.I will not give away the rest. But this a movie that should be viewed by everybody. It goes to show you that dreams may change, but friends are forever and beyond.

591950,A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ,B00005JKWM,David M. Lovin,"[1, 2]","Britney Spears can act.  Maybe not yet at the level where she will be getting any gold trophies to go next to the music awards, but she can hold her own in front of the camera.  In fact, this film almost tries to help her out too much, as if she is not able to handle the material on her own.  You can't go 10 minutes without a)seeing Britney in some skimpy outfit or b) hearing her sing or c) both.If she were not able to handle the role, these things would be necessary.  Then the audience would not have to realize they are watching a no-talent hack.  But that is not the case here.  What's possibly most impressive is that the script is nothing special at all, yet the movie is touching and real.Spears stars as Lucy, class valedictorian and beauty who has lost touch with her two best friends over the years.  On their graduation night, they agreed to dig up the time capsule they buried together when they were 10.  None really want to do it, but they all meet at the place and see what their dreams were at the time.One of her friends (Mimi) had the ambition to have the world and she sees herself succeeding in music.  She is heading to LA for an audition in a couple of days and invites her friends to go.  Each girl has her own agenda and reason to go west, so they pile into the car of a local hunk for a ride and head off.A few things almost always happen on trips like this (breakdown, amorous feelings between two of the passengers) which makes it seem that this movie is predictable and has nothing to offer.  Not so.  The characters and acting are superb and the story has enough turns to make it interesting.I am looking forward to seeing Britney in another movie.  This was not Schindler's List by any means, yet she was a reason to watch and not just because of her beauty.  Like I said, they could have toned that down a lot and let her act.

591951,A22S91YEO8DJBF,B00005JKWM,David R. Lorenz,"[1, 2]","I am a father of a daughter who absolutely loves Britney Spears. So, of course she knows that this movie is out on video, and really wants to see it. I, being a protective parent, one who honers the motion picture rating system, told her I need to preview it, and judge if it's ok for her to see or not (she's 7 and the film is rated PG13 for sexual content and brief teen drinking).I will also admit, before this movie, and before buying my daughter the Britney Spears Dance Beat video game for the Sony Playstation 2, I wasn't a real big Britney Spears fan myself. I knew who she was, and recognized a song or two of hers on the radio, but that had been the extent of it.But, after watching Crossroads, with the intent of checking it to make sure my daughter might be able to watch it, I will say, in all honesty, I loved this movie. Let me try my best to describe the film, without giving too much away (not wanting to ruin anything for someone who hasn't yet seen it).The movie opens with 3 young girls, children, putting personal items into a box, items that have resembelance, and significance to their dreams, promising that after they graduate from high school, they would return to that same spot, dig up the box, and reexamine the dreams and goals they set for themselves; also swearing the would be friends for ever.Well, for ever is shortened to eight years, as we see these same girls, in the midst of their high school graduation, not being able to stand each other; they simply grew apart over the years.The friends; Lucy (Britney Spears), Kit (Zoe Saldana), Mimi (Taryn Manning), reluctantly return to the scene in which they burried their ""box of dreams"" as children just eight years earlier.Lucy reveals her dreams was to go to Arizona to see her mother (Kim Cattrall), who had left her and her father (Dan Aykroyd) when she was very young; Kit's dream was to marry her high school sweetheart; Mimi admits to being unhappy where she is, and wants to travel and see the world. Mimi also reveals she wants to go to L.A. for an audition for a record label. She convinces Kit and Lucy to tag along with her, and so they set off to sunny California.Lucy's main intent for traveling with them, was to be dropped off in Arizona so she could see her mother. A very emotional scene here. Kim Cattrall, as Lucy's mother, does not look too thrilled to see her own daughter, and actually asks Lucy ""why are you here?"" She doesn't even try to hide the fact that Lucy is very much unwelcome, and admits that she never wanted Lucy; Lucy was an umwelcome accident.Lucy, heartbroken, reunites with her friends, and continues their quest to L.A.Kits turn for shattered dreams. She surprises her fiance, and becomes surprised herself when she catches him with another woman.The entire road trip, throughout the movie, is also a quest for personal soul-searching and self discovery, and re-kindling what had started out as a broken friendship.A very touching movie. But, alas, I will have to break the bad news to my daughter, as it is not intended for younger viewers.Here's why: In a couple scenes, they show Britney Spears in just her underwear (no nudity...just underwear); and there are moments of sexual intent (even tho they don't show anything...not appropriate for children). There is sexual innuendo and sexual dialogue.I hope this review has been helpful; and I hope I haven't spoiled anything for those who have not yet seen Crossroads.",5,A road trip of personal soul-searching and self discovery,1027814400,"07 28, 2002",2002,3446,"['am', 'father', 'daughter', 'who', 'absolutely', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'So', 'course', 'movie', 'out', 'video', 'really', 'see', 'being', 'protective', 'parent', 'one', 'who', 'motion', 'picture', 'rating', 'system', 'told', 'need', 'preview', 'judge', 'ok', 'see', 'not', '7', 'film', 'rated', 'PG13', 'sexual', 'content', 'brief', 'teen', 'drinking', '.I', 'will', 'also', 'admit', 'movie', 'buying', 'daughter', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'Dance', 'Beat', 'video', 'game', 'Sony', 'Playstation', '2', 'was', ""n't"", 'real', 'big', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'fan', 'knew', 'who', 'was', 'recognized', 'song', 'two', 'hers', 'radio', 'had', 'been', 'extent', 'it.But', 'watching', 'Crossroads', 'intent', 'checking', 'make', 'sure', 'daughter', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'will', 'say', 'honesty', 'loved', 'movie', 'Let', 'try', 'best', 'describe', 'film', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'not', 'wanting', 'ruin', 'anything', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'yet', 'seen', 'movie', '3', 'young', 'girls', 'children', 'putting', 'personal', 'items', 'box', 'items', 'have', 'resembelance', 'significance', 'dreams', 'promising', 'graduate', 'high', 'school', 'would', 'return', 'same', 'spot', 'dig', 'up', 'box', 'reexamine', 'dreams', 'goals', 'set', 'also', 'swearing', 'would', 'be', 'friends', 'ever.Well', 'ever', 'shortened', 'eight', 'years', 'see', 'same', 'girls', 'midst', 'high', 'school', 'graduation', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'stand', 'other', 'simply', 'grew', 'apart', 'years.The', 'friends', 'Lucy', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'Kit', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'Mimi', 'Taryn', 'Manning', 'reluctantly', 'return', 'scene', 'burried', 'box', 'dreams', 'children', 'just', 'eight', 'years', 'earlier.Lucy', 'dreams', 'was', 'go', 'Arizona', 'see', 'mother', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'who', 'had', 'left', 'father', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'when', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'Kit', 'dream', 'was', 'marry', 'high', 'school', 'sweetheart', 'Mimi', 'being', 'unhappy', 'where', 'travel', 'see', 'world', 'Mimi', 'also', 'go', 'L.A.', 'audition', 'record', 'label', 'Kit', 'Lucy', 'tag', 'so', 'set', 'off', 'sunny', 'California.Lucy', 'main', 'intent', 'traveling', 'was', 'be', 'dropped', 'off', 'Arizona', 'could', 'see', 'mother', 'very', 'emotional', 'scene', 'here', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'Lucy', 'mother', 'not', 'look', 'too', 'thrilled', 'see', 'own', 'daughter', 'actually', 'Lucy', 'why', 'are', 'here', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'hide', 'fact', 'Lucy', 'very', 'much', 'unwelcome', 'never', 'wanted', 'Lucy', 'Lucy', 'was', 'umwelcome', 'accident.Lucy', 'heartbroken', 'friends', 'quest', 'L.A.Kits', 'turn', 'shattered', 'dreams', 'fiance', 'becomes', 'surprised', 'when', 'woman.The', 'entire', 'road', 'trip', 'movie', 'also', 'quest', 'personal', 'soul-searching', 'self', 'discovery', 're-kindling', 'what', 'had', 'started', 'out', 'broken', 'friendship.A', 'very', 'touching', 'movie', 'alas', 'will', 'have', 'break', 'bad', 'news', 'daughter', 'not', 'intended', 'younger', 'why', 'couple', 'scenes', 'show', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'just', 'underwear', 'nudity', 'just', 'underwear', 'are', 'moments', 'sexual', 'intent', 'even', 'tho', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'anything', 'not', 'appropriate', 'children', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'sexual', 'dialogue.I', 'hope', 'review', 'been', 'helpful', 'hope', 'have', ""n't"", 'spoiled', 'anything', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'Crossroads']",N/A

I'm not a Britney Spears fan, nor will I ever be in her current state, but you won't see me pour acid on the movie's DVD package in bitter disgust.  It was a decent enough road film, not exactly what I like to see from the director of ""CB4"" and ""Billy Madison"", but it cares enough of what the film wants to be.  Although I'm not entirely believing in Britney's character (her, a valedictorian nerd?  HA!), her performance wasn't so bad.  She's noCheror evenBeyonc&eacute;, but she played her character with a grounded altitude, so I wouldn't call it bad acting.  Her supporting cast are pretty decent, with one of them surprisingly turning out to be Zo ""Neytiri"" Saldana; if anything I learned from this movie, it's that Zo has beenhankeringforwhite meatfor a LONG while.It is the type of movie where Britney Spears is hogging up the musical spotlight whenever the movie gives it to her.  Heck, one of the Spears' best friends, a pregnant trailer-trash, had a dream of being a singer and she eventually gave her dream away to the main lead; isn't that convenient?  The story was told well enough in itself, a trio of high school graduates going on a trip while rekindling their friendship that was lost since childhood, but I have to complain about the one plot moment where one of the characters confronted her boyfriend, on the other side of the nation, who just happened to be the one who raped the other character.  That moment, to me, was improbable and very contrived; just the because the movie wanted to resolve a sub-plot doesn't mean it has to, and sometimes it's best to leave things unresolved so characters can learn to grow.  Britney's love-interest, and driver of the trip, is just your typical five-o-clock shadow hunky with a bad attitude, though I have to say among the girl cast, he's quite a dweeb; the dude doesn't want the girls to touch his car, he has a problem with pop music, that dude has to stop whining.  But overall, one can do worse than watching ""Crossroads"".

They are graduating high school and trying ot figure out their futures. Lucy is supposed to go to college in Georgia with a double major in biology and chemistry. Being the perfect child. Mimi has no plans for her future, but she's 5 months pregnat. Kit wants to marry her boyfriend who goes to college in California.So, MImi says she's going to an audition in LA and taking a roadtrip out there. The next morning Kit and Lucy decide to go along for the ride - Kit to see her boyfriend, Lucy to find the mother who abandoned her when she was three. Lots of singing, lots of skin showing to be ""sexy"" (shoot the movie starts with Spears in briefs and singing in bed).Surprisingly, the acting was fairly good. All the actors/actresses do a good job of portraying teenagers who are in between immaturity and maturity. And they do a great job showing how old friends can become friends once more.However... everything else? Assuming this movie is aimed at Spears' followers, the audience was probably preteens to teens. At the beginning of the movie, it pretty much bashes virgins and that a guy who's a virgin can't make it in college because of the harassement. Spears wants to lose her virginity just cause. Lucy pretty much just runs away from her dad. Mimi's friend Ben, who is driving the car... nobody seems to know anything about him yet they're hitching a ride with him anyway? Everybody thinks he's a murderer, and three teenage girls just hop in the car for a 3000 mile roadtrip!? While on the trip, seatbelts are rarely, if ever, worn. At one point the girls are standing in the backseat singing. The girls get drunk one night, and although Mimi doesn't drink, the movie doesnt seem to be promoting abstaining from alcohol. Then, Lucy and Ben get together after only knowing each other like a week.Granted teenagers do this stuff all on their own, but do we really need a movie advocating it? Because Spears is such an idol to so many young kids, do we really need her promoting these ideas?And plotwise...come on, three girls going across the country for no particular reason at all? Lucy is going to see a mother who pretty much doesnt give a darn about her. Why not CALL her?? Kit is going to visit a boyfriend who doesnt seem to give a darn about her... why not CALL him?? and Mimi is just off to go audition - like you can't audition anywhere in Georgia.

I remember the hype machine going into full effect for the release of this film, and it seemed like it was going to achieve the instant, inexplicable success that Britney Spears's abysmal recording have received - and given her infamous ego, I'm sure she thought so, too.  But this was not to be - the film was blasted by critics and more or less tanked at the box office.  Nevertheless, I watched the movie with an open mind - either I was going to be pleasantly surprised or it would be 90 minutes of my life I'd never get back.  Not surprisingly, it was the latter.Think of the whole film as an opportunity for Spears to stroke her own ego: Take a tired road trip premise, throw in talented actors like Dan Aykroyd and Kim Cattrall to make the film look somewhat credible (both must have been hard out for a paycheck) along with some irrelevant teen actors and what you get is uninspired, formulaic drivel with no discernible purpose.  Spears is unconvincing as an intelligent high school graduate who decides to bypass college for a potential career in music: in one ridiculous scene, she reads an atrocious poem to one of her friends (the one where she says she's not a girl, and not a woman either) who actually thinks it's brilliant (yeah - if it's the first poem you've ever heard) and turns it into a song.  There's an unintentionally hilarious scene that features an awkward moment between Spears and a kid that looks exactly like Paul from &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;: they are on the verge of a promiscuous act before Spears concludes that she's &quot;not ready&quot; - the exchange in the aftermath of this is downright embarrassing.  Apparently they added this scene to differentiate Spears's character Lucy from the person portraying her - it doesn't advance the &quot;plot&quot; (of which there is hardly any) at all and merely acts as filler.Take the most maudlin, melodramatic movie you can think of and multiply it by 100: that in a nutshell describes Crossroads.  There's nothing you'll see here that hasn't been done before: It's just an excuse for Spears to prance around in tight clothes and underwear.In summary: Unreleasable if not for the presence of Spears (everything she touched up to this point turned to gold - I still can't see why), I would have to say that Crossroads is not worth your time.

Ok, so it's only a teen movie...but it's a really GOOD teen movie!!! I'm not sure why or how this film touched me so much, but it truly did. Britney Spears shows some great acting promise, and she is well supported by Zoe Saldana and Taryn Manning. The girls play three childhood friends who reach their high school graduation, hardly on speaking terms. They think they've grown apart, but as they embark on a road trip together, they realize that their friendship never died--they just walked away from it.You probably don't expect a movie with much depth if it's Britney Spears. Well, let me tell you--when you watch this, you can expect a deep, touching story with a certain degree of realness that I haven't seen in any other movie in my life. Yes, this movie is very real and convincing; every issue presented in here is one that you can either relate to or at least appreciate and understand.I was impressed with Britney's acting. I must admit that I thought this movie would be horrible. But now I regard it as one of my favorites. Spears has the ability to act, and I was convinced of this when I saw her crying scene with Ben (Anson Mount) in the bathroom. I choke up every time I watch this part--it's so REAL, and if it doesn't touch you in some way, I'd be surprised. After seeing this scene, I knew that she was an actress.You'll love it or you'll hate it. I love it. It has touched me in a way that no other teen movie ever has.

Yes, it is a bad movie for a number of reasons.  It is adult content.  You know, profanity, sex (rape), unwed motherhood, et cetera, et cetera.  Some have said that this movie changed their lives because they cried at the movie.  Hey, if every movie you cry at will change your life, how about trying ""Schindler's List.""  There's a terrific movie to change your life.All in all, though, Britney Spears is ""allegedly"" a role model to many young girls out there, and this is not a movie which really encourages those youngsters or shows them what a real role model is.  Where's Britney's femininity, or her aspiring nobility or even dignity?  Where are those thing?  It appears she has sold out to the Hollywood notion that Madonna sold out to, and all the others, including Drew Barrymoore and others.  Sex may sell, but it doesn't do a thing to impress the moms and dads out there who want to keep their little ones from harm.This movie is harmful on a lot of levels, and if you all out there think it's a great movie, maybe you are at the level where Britney is in this movie, so you can relate.  I'd suggest that you find a different role model.Do you remember the Rolling Stone cover not too long ago with a nearly disrobed Britney Spears on the cover?  That, in itself, speaks volumes, and my two daughters WILL NOT be impressed with the kind of ""lack of dignity and role model"" this Spears has shown us.Moms, keep your daughters away from this film.  Dads, if you are out for a treat or at home looking for a good movie, try an old fashioned Disney one.  Maybe Pollyanna or even Mary Poppins.  Two great flics.

591963,A2FQDF8QE9B9BC,B00005JKWM,"H. Detter ""Finally""","[1, 2]","...I actually enjoyed this movie. Because of her status in pop culture, it's difficult to not have some predetermined thoughts of Britney Spears and her choosing to branch out in a different area of entertainment. Having said that, I decided to watch this movie from the point of view of someone who had never heard of Britney. I wasn't successful. The marketing of her image proved to be too powerful an influence for me to pretend as though I were from the deep jungles of South America. Though I own none of her CDs, I enjoy much of Britney's music. Thus I just decided to view it from just my personal perspective.Is ""Crossroads"" as good as ""Can't Hardly Wait"", ""Sixteen Candles"" or ""Heathers""? Absolutely not but few adolescent themed movies can match the quality of the aforementioned. I'm sure ""Crossroads"" will be over looked and even trashed by those who view Britney Spears through horned-rimmed glasses but if it's not their loss, at minimum it's just unnecessary. With an open mind, there's decent quality to be found in this movie. There are three fairly decent actors with just a smidgeon of chemistry (Anson Mount, Zo? Saldana & Taryn Manning), a nicely written script (3 young females, once best friends who take different paths over the years, decide to go on a road trip to California which enables them to rekindle their closeness) and good pacing by the director. Dig a little more and you find well done supporting roles by some a couple of respected actors with Dan Ackroyd and Kim Cattrall as the father and mother of Britney's character. The talented Justin Long makes excellent use of his brief screen time as Britney's character's lab partner and pursuer. And then there's Britney herself. While obviously new to movies, her time in front of the interview camera, onstage and in the public eye in general enabled her to seem very natural on screen. Britney has had an incredibly successful music career thus far. But with teen idol careers for the most part not lasting well into adulthood, if she gets serious about acting she may very well have a respectable career.What I like most about this movie is that nothing seems forced. The writer and director chose not to shove too much skin down your throats (save for a scene near the beginning of the movie), they wrote just the right amount of dialog for the actors (only a few scenes of 3 giggly females talking 4000 words a minute and finishing each other's sentences) and even the serious subject matters (teen pregnancy, estranged parent figures & romance) were handled in a manner that wasn't overwrought.Finally, there have been worse results of other celebrities branching out into other areas of entertainment (Mariah Carey's movie ""Glitter"" was inexcusably horrible). So if you're open minded or a fan of Britney's, you may want to give this movie a shot.",3,I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING THIS BUT...

I admit I am way, way too old to be going to Britney Spears movies or commenting on them, I know that, however, I really was looking forward to this film, I saw it at the cheap $2.00 theaters where such films wind up soon, very soon, after release.  The thing is that ""crossroads"" was a lousy movie to begin with, whether or not Britney Spears was in it doesn't matter.  The ""friendship"" is never explained or believable, the ""road trip"" is equally silly none of which would matter if we cared about the characters or believed one word of this.  I can forgive much in a film, silly underwear dancing and such (not nearly enough underwear dancing) are OK, but when our heroines win ""The Big Karaoke Contest"" and get goo gobs of money they immediately check into a super fancy hotel and order room service and get drunk and giggle.......and giggle...and on and on, oh God the humanity, rarely have we seen such a blatant attempt to fill space with anything, I mean anything to move the film along.  Cut out characters, stupid situations we all saw none miles down the road, one girls boyfriend hasn't called since he left there backwater town, do ya think he might have another girl?  I won't give anything away, I promise.  Britney parodies herself by singing an old Joan Jett song (a song that was a cover to begin with, I bet I'm the only person who can tell you who the original band was, care?  Me neither) interesting since Britney Spears' thing is to lip synch in Music video's none of the irony is realized.  Perhaps the most interesting scene is when Ms.Spears has to tell the cool guy (I won't say whether or not the hunky driver is the one Britney loses her virginity to, ya gatta see for yourself) that her mother told her she was a mistake, she breaks down and cry's and, God help us, she was pretty good, no really, she could almost act and can in a film suited to her.  A walk to Remember was a good film because the producers know the star and built the film around her, this film was in production before Britney signed on, bad idea.  I don't hate Britney Spears the fact that she still matters after all this long four years is testament to her...whatever it is she has that keeps people coming back.

591984,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JKWM,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 8]","Britney Spears is certainly the best thing about ""Crossroads,"" although I did get the impression they were doing their best to exploit her in this film.  I mean even though this film is about three girl friends rediscovering their friendships on a crosscountry road trip (at least at face value), the only one of the three women to be seen in any serious state of undress is Britney Spears.  That just strikes me as being a bit much.The story is as old as the hills.  Once upon a time there were three young girls who were best friends, but when they graduate from high school they have gone in totally different directions.  However, they had vowed that at midnight on graduation day they would dig up a box they had buried eight years earlier in which they placed their dreams.  They show up and end up trekking from Georgia to California for different reasons: Mimi (Taryn Manning) wants to go audition for a music company in L.A., Kit (Zoe Saldana) wants to track down her fiance in the same city, while Lucy (Britney) wants to get dropped off in Arizona to see the mom who abandoned her when she was three.  Behind the wheel of the convertible is Ben Kimble (Anson Mount), who supposedly just got out of prison for killing a man.Sure fired recipe for fun, huh?  Toss into the mix Lucy's overbearing father (Dan Ackroyd), the need to have enough money to finance the trip, and several other traditional road picture elements.  But clearly the point of this film is to get Britney Spears up on the silver screen to see if she can make the transition.  Ironcially, the first time we see Spears she is singing along to a Madonna's ""Open Your Heart"" (which might be some sort of exorcism rite given the Material Girl's hit and miss film career).  This leads me to make a series of disjointed comments regarding ""Crossroads"":(1) I like the way the music is worked into the film as Lucy and the other girls sing along with what is on the radio, do karoke, or whatever.  (2) Britney Spears might have the whitest teeth on earth.  (3) Henry (Justin Long) might have had a lot more success with his graduate night plans if he had put on his list that Lucy is a real babe.  (4) People who cannot stand up and sing at a karoke bar should rethink plans for careers as a recording artist.  (5) There is a major highway that can get you from Georgia to California.  Besides, how in the world if you leave first thing in the morning from Georgia can you only make it as far as Alabama by nightfall not to mention taking another two days to get to Louisiana?  (6) I was going to give the film bonus points for finding someone to look like a young Britney Spears as Young Lucy, but they cheated in this film.  (7) Britney Spears' two big songs for this film, ""I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman"" and ""Overprotected"", both fit the storyline perfectly, which is pretty impressive when you stop and think about it.  (8) I think all four of the travellers in this road picture did credible jobs of acting and it would be nice if they each found some decent property to do next.",4,"Okay, Britney Spears can act.

591985,AT1GMH2UHYROT,B00005JKWM,Lee DeWald,"[24, 32]","Since not very many people have been able to write a decent review of this movie, I felt compelled to do so.  A movie as refreshing as this is worth it, in my humble opinion.""Crossroads"" is the story of three girls (Britney Spears as Lucy; Taryn Manning as Mimi; and Zoe Saldana as Kit) who decide to take a road trip to pursue their individual dreams.  Lucy wants to travel to Arizona to see the mother (acted by Kim Cattrall) that skipped out on her and her father (played admirably by Dan Akroyd) when she was three; Mimi has aspirations of a singing career and wants to head to California for an open audition; and Kit just wants to tag along to California to visit the man that never has any time for her, her husband-to-be.  Close friends when they were tiny tots, they grew apart as they reached maturity, each taking the individual path that life has led them.Lucy is the all-around brain and good girl who never disobeys her father.  And - surprise, surprise - she can sing and dance, too!  Mimi is five months pregnant, garnering a reputation that precedes her wherever she goes.  And Kit is just a stuck-up, always-clamoring-for-a-mirror type of girl who takes wicked delight in her popularity and good looks.  Little do these three girls know that life will bring their lives full circle.  And that at the end of the road, they will be as close as they've ever been.Now when I first heard that Britney Spears was going to be in a movie, I had my own conclusions.  I had seen her act on an episode of ""Sabrina: The Teenage Witch"" a few years back; you could definitely tell that she was new to the acting thing.  But then she went and did ""Saturday Night Live"" the next year and really showed the world that she was capable of something more.  Her performance as Dawn Paslowski, the bad-to-the-bone Mousketeer, was particularly memorable.  And after having seen her strut her stuff in her feature film debut, I can officially declare it - Britney Spears can act, whether people like to admit it or not.Britney has a very natural acting ability, which comes across so smoothly on-screen.  It seems as though she's barely making an effort; that's how real it looks.  And she does more than dance, sing and smile in this movie - I was genuinely moved by some of the things the script called on her to do.  She has two - yes, two - crying scenes, the second one being an absolute standout.  There is something in that very poignant scene alone that deserves praise.  It was almost a little too real.  This is something you've never seen out of Britney.  Anyone who slams her performance obviously doesn't know good acting.And the rest of the cast is outstanding as well.  Taryn Manning is a delight as the preconceived Mimi, giving her a strength and endearing quality that the character needed to have in order to make her believable.  And Zoe Saldana as Kit is just fabulous - she touches all the right chords with the character.  She can be fussy, she can be funny, and she can be moving.  I especially loved the casting of Dan Akroyd (as Lucy's father) and Kim Cattrall (as Lucy's mother).  Their mere presence in the movie lends a credibility to the film that otherwise might not have been there.  Not that the film wouldn't have been able to stand on its own without them; it's just that with two high-caliber stars like Akroyd and Cattrall, it lends it that certain ""star-quality"" style.  And just to note: Cattrall and Britney look so much alike in the movie, you really do believe that they are mother and daughter.  And, of course, we can't forget about the hunk behind the wheel, Ben (played by Anson Mount).  Mount lends a ruggedness - yet a very real feel - to the movie that definitely needed balancing out due to all the female goings-on.  His and Britney's chemistry in their scenes together is definitely something to watch for.As far as the DVD goes, you can't go wrong with it.  It has a host of features, highlighted by behind-the-scenes featurettes and commentaries by the director and writers.  I have never before listened to a commentary while watching a film, but I did for this film, and it was very interesting.  There are several bonus features in this package, and they just add to an already stellar DVD.  The transfer is absolutely brilliant - I have never seen a picture look so sharp.I really enjoyed this movie.  I had my apprehensions, but Britney - supported by an excellent ensemble cast - allayed those apprehensions.  Just because it has Britney Spears on the cover, don't assume that you're getting a particular type of movie.  This one was everything I didn't think it would be - funny, charming, endearing, scary, heartfelt, and most of all - real.Kudos to the cast and crew for making a movie that people everywhere can relate to.  I, for one, was genuinely touched by it.",5,Britney Makes a Splash in Her Film Debut,1028073600,"07 31, 2002",2002,4822,"['not', 'very', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'write', 'decent', 'review', 'movie', 'felt', 'compelled', 'do', 'so', 'movie', 'as', 'refreshing', 'worth', 'humble', 'opinion', 'Crossroads', 'story', 'three', 'girls', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'Lucy', 'Taryn', 'Manning', 'Mimi', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'Kit', 'who', 'decide', 'take', 'road', 'trip', 'pursue', 'individual', 'dreams', 'Lucy', 'travel', 'Arizona', 'see', 'mother', 'acted', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'skipped', 'out', 'father', 'played', 'admirably', 'Dan', 'Akroyd', 'when', 'was', 'three', 'Mimi', 'aspirations', 'singing', 'career', 'head', 'California', 'open', 'audition', 'Kit', 'just', 'tag', 'California', 'visit', 'man', 'never', 'time', 'husband-to-be', 'Close', 'friends', 'when', 'were', 'tiny', 'tots', 'grew', 'apart', 'reached', 'maturity', 'taking', 'individual', 'path', 'life', 'led', 'them.Lucy', 'all-around', 'brain', 'good', 'girl', 'who', 'never', 'disobeys', 'father', 'surprise', 'surprise', 'can', 'sing', 'dance', 'too', 'Mimi', 'five', 'months', 'pregnant', 'garnering', 'reputation', 'wherever', 'Kit', 'just', 'stuck-up', 'always-clamoring-for-a-mirror', 'type', 'girl', 'who', 'wicked', 'delight', 'popularity', 'good', 'looks', 'Little', 'do', 'three', 'girls', 'know', 'life', 'will', 'bring', 'lives', 'full', 'circle', 'end', 'road', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'close', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'movie', 'had', 'own', 'conclusions', 'had', 'seen', 'act', 'episode', 'Sabrina', 'Teenage', 'Witch', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'could', 'definitely', 'tell', 'was', 'new', 'acting', 'thing', 'then', 'went', 'did', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'next', 'year', 'really', 'showed', 'world', 'was', 'capable', 'something', 'more', 'performance', 'Dawn', 'Paslowski', 'bad-to-the-bone', 'Mousketeer', 'was', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'having', 'seen', 'strut', 'stuff', 'feature', 'film', 'debut', 'can', 'officially', 'declare', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'can', 'act', 'people', 'admit', 'not.Britney', 'very', 'natural', 'acting', 'ability', 'so', 'smoothly', 'on-screen', 'barely', 'making', 'effort', 'how', 'real', 'more', 'dance', 'sing', 'smile', 'movie', 'was', 'genuinely', 'moved', 'things', 'script', 'called', 'do', 'two', 'yes', 'two', 'crying', 'scenes', 'second', 'one', 'being', 'absolute', 'standout', 'something', 'very', 'poignant', 'scene', 'alone', 'praise', 'was', 'almost', 'little', 'too', 'real', 'something', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Britney', 'Anyone', 'who', 'performance', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'know', 'good', 'rest', 'cast', 'outstanding', 'as', 'well', 'Taryn', 'Manning', 'delight', 'preconceived', 'Mimi', 'giving', 'strength', 'endearing', 'quality', 'character', 'needed', 'have', 'order', 'make', 'believable', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'Kit', 'just', 'fabulous', 'right', 'chords', 'character', 'can', 'be', 'fussy', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'can', 'be', 'moving', 'especially', 'loved', 'casting', 'Dan', 'Akroyd', 'Lucy', 'father', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'Lucy', 'mother', 'mere', 'presence', 'movie', 'credibility', 'film', 'otherwise', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'there', 'Not', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'able', 'stand', 'own', 'just', 'two', 'high-caliber', 'stars', 'Akroyd', 'Cattrall', 'certain', 'star-quality', 'style', 'just', 'note', 'Cattrall', 'Britney', 'look', 'so', 'much', 'alike', 'movie', 'really', 'do', 'believe', 'are', 'mother', 'daughter', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'hunk', 'wheel', 'Ben', 'played', 'Anson', 'Mount', 'Mount', 'ruggedness', 'yet', 'very', 'real', 'feel', 'movie', 'definitely', 'needed', 'balancing', 'out', 'due', 'female', 'goings-on', 'Britney', 'chemistry', 'scenes', 'together', 'definitely', 'something', 'watch', 'for.As', 'far', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'host', 'features', 'highlighted', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurettes', 'commentaries', 'director', 'writers', 'have', 'never', 'before', 'listened', 'commentary', 'watching', 'film', 'did', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'are', 'several', 'bonus', 'features', 'package', 'just', 'add', 'already', 'stellar', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'picture', 'look', 'so', 'sharp.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'had', 'apprehensions', 'Britney', 'supported', 'excellent', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'allayed', 'apprehensions', 'Just', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'cover', 'do', ""n't"", 'assume', ""'re"", 'getting', 'particular', 'type', 'movie', 'one', 'was', 'everything', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'funny', 'charming', 'endearing', 'scary', 'heartfelt', 'most', 'real.Kudos', 'cast', 'crew', 'making', 'movie', 'people', 'everywhere', 'can', 'relate', 'one', 'was', 'genuinely', 'touched']",N/A

Now, they are faced with resolutions: Lucy is determined to find her mom who left her as a child, Mimi is pregnant but she wants to participate in a singing contest and Kit wants to surprise her fiance and come and see him - sadly he is the one who surprises her.Britney Spears delivers a fantastic performance.

I'm surprised it made it to movie theaters instead of just being a made for tv VH1 or MTV movie which is what it should have been. Its not entirely Britney's fault though. I think if she had a better script and if they used better actors, I think their acting abilities would rub off on her and help her become a better actress.

Still, deciding to give it a fair chance, I watched this with less than zero expectations.What a shocker. This was not at all the fluffy teen coming-of-age comedy that I thought it would be. Instead, what we get is a dark, sombre and chilling meditation on adolescent life, and none of the lead characters are perfect angels. One of them is pregnant, one is chronically obsessed with herself, and the other is looking for her birth mother.Perhaps the saddest, most poignant scene here is when Britney, who is in search of her biological mother, finally lands up at her mothers' door. This entire segment plays out like some of the best indie cinema I've seen. Her mother tells her that she hates her and regrets the day she was born. How realistic! No happy ending here. Watching the young Miss Spears pull off this mature scene with the most nuanced facial expressions, I was quite taken with her actual acting ability. She's not Meryl Streep, but she does have a certain *something*.Yes, the film does have its' cheesy moments (the male lead is thoroughly wasted), and the gratuitous performance of the horrid ""I Love Rock and Roll"" by Britney at a karaoke bar is perhaps the most annoying thing here. But there is much to rediscover and love about this film.

I've heard so many bad reviews about this film, but seeing as I have a tendancy to like ""bad"" films, I decided to buy it. And it's well worth the money! It has loads of extras, and even though it was filmed in 40 days, it doesn't look rushed or anything.The movie starts with Britney dancing around (and singing) in her underwear (which she does a LOT, guys) to Madonna (and a couple of years later, she kisses her on stage, and they're now ""best friends""!) Dan Aykroyd plays the overprotective, dorky father, a role which he played extremely well in My Girl 1 & 2.It is your teenage chick flick, but I enjoyed it, OK? It has a lot of teenage issues in it - boys, parents, sex, etc. A lot of people will relate to the issues raised in this, and the people. But the film doesn't go as far to teach you a lesson, which would have made the film totally patronising.Taryn Manning plays Mimi, who's 5 months pregnant. She also starred in 8 Mile, and plays the same kind of character - just a bigger role.There are a lot of shots of Britney's very enviable body, so girls, get ready to go green with jealousy! (And there's no way Britney had a boob job, as she's been rumoured to have - you see her in a bikini, and she would have got them bigger than that!) The director seemed to make sure Britney showed off her body, and her voice as much as possible. It's good to hear Britney sing in the film and in the extras. She's got a great voice, and the film showed this off.There's a couple of cringe worthy moments - when Britney sings along to ""Bye Bye Bye"" by NSync (oops!), when her character meets her ""mom"", and in the extras, when she says she's thinking of Justin when she's kissing Anson whatshisface.When you watch the extras, you get the feeling that everyone had a great time filming together, and you definitely see a different side to Britney, rather than what the press portrays her as.The extras boasts everything you could want from extras! Lots of outtakes, how to make T-shirts, Britney's videos, the premier of Crossroads (where Britney famously got slated for in the UK, for not stopping to speak to the fans).This DVD is definitely worth the money. If you're a teenage girl, you'll relate to the characters. Whether you're the quiet geeky one, the one who has a reputation, or the one who fancies herself (I know which one I am!). If you're a guy, you'll love Britney showing off her body, in not a lot sometimes, and her flat stomach (grrrr).

Aficionados of teen movies should not overlook this entry into the genre.THE STORY:Lucy (Spears), Mimi (Taryn Manning) and Kit (Zoe Saldana) are three former childhood friends who after graduation decide (for various individual reasons) to go on a cross-country road trip with mysterious rocker Ben (Anson Mount).  The cross-country journey metaphorically symbolizes the cast's own voyages of self-discovery as they leave behind their youth and boldly emerge into the world of adult womanhood.THE COOL THINGS:The ""self-discovery"" story is the true driver of this surprisingly good film.  The other added bonuses would be seeing the cool American countryside as the cast makes its way cross-country as well as the pretty hip pop soundtrack.THE DVD SPECIAL FEATURES:Fans of STACKED DVDs will be pleased with this entry.  There are tons of cool features on the Crossroads DVD.  Here they are:1.  Featurettes:a. 40 Days, the Making of Crossroads.  25 minute featurette that goes behind the scenes into the filming of the movie.b. Taryn's T-shirts:  11 minute featurette that showcases how to make Taryn Manning's (Mimi) cool t-shirts from the Karaoke scene.  Eh...c. Zoe's Premiere:  7 minute featurette that follows Zoe Saldana's (Kit) big Crossroad's premiere experience.2.  Deleted Scenes with Introductory Commentary by Director Tamra Davis.  7 scenes altogether.  The commentary is helpful and the scenes range from pretty good to ""yeah, I can see why they cut it...""3.  Commentary Track with Producer Ann Carli, Director Tamra Davis and Writer Shonda Rhimes.  Always insightful...4.  2 Music Videos: Britney Spear's ""Overprotected"" and ""I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman""  Like most music videos on DVDs, an alright feature...5.  ""Break Through Britney"":  Fun facts that you can access in the movie.  Pretty nifty...6.  ""Sing Along With Britney"":  Karaoke versions of ""I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman"" and ""Overprotected.""  Now THIS is cool...7.  ""Edit Your Own Video"":  Cool interactive version of ""I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman"" where you can pick three pieces of video footage and ""edit"" your version of the song.8.

Reaction to it was at both extremes, you either loved it or lampooned it, however, taking a ""middle"" ground and watching it for what it is, it's actually a very nice ""coming of age"" story.

Britney has had so many breakdowns and comebacks over the past couple of years that it's hard to keep track. Shonda Rhimes has gone on to create ""Grey's Anatomy"" but before she started writing about the E.R. she penned this girl empowerment film. The film is a testament to renewing and strengthening one's friendships. The film is very powerful and moving in several scenes. Take for example the moment when Lucy (Britney Spears) is sobbing uncontrollably on her bed while her father (Dan Akroyd) tries to comfort her. It is Lucy's graduation day and she has been voted class valedictorian. She laments all the fun things that she missed out on like football games and dances when she was studying and maintaining her good grades. In a vulnerable moment she looks at her father and in a trembling voice asks ""Is that all there is?"". Powerful stuff that I think we can all relate to. Lucy is searching for a lot of things in her life right now. They include meaning, her  mother who walked out on her and her dad when she was only a small child, and some support from her friends. Her childhood best friends Mimi (Taryn Manning) and Kit (Zoe Saldana) abandoned her long ago since they think she is too innocent to keep up with their fast lifestyles. Mimi is pregnant and has yet to reveal the father's identity and Kit is engaged to a boy in college who she talks to over the phone. It is after their graduation party that the girls reunite and set off on a road trip. When they were little they buried a shoebox full of artifacts which represented their dreams for the future. Mimi wanted to be a singer, Kit a beautiful bride, and Lucy wanted to reconnect with her mother. Mimi is going to a music audition and the girls, after much convincing on her part, agree to go with her. They tell her they will be her backup singers but each one has other motives. Lucy will hopefully find her mom and Kit will visit her fiance at his dorm.  Mimi has already arranged transportation for the girls in the hunky presence of Ben (Anson Mount). Lucy is horrified to learn that Ben was in the pen believed to have murdered a man. The girls, save for Mimi, are terrified to be in the same car let alone being driven past state lines with a convicted manslaughter but they soon learn the real reason for his incarceration. Ben hit a man who was assaulting his stepsister which  earns him points in Lucy's book. She regards him as a protective and sensitive man that she can fall in love with. Do the girls make it to their destination and achieve their dreams? It's irrelevant because if this film teaches us anything it's that the journey is more important than arriving at the destination. What they learn about each other is what is going to help them realize their dreams and live happy and contented lives. I know as a viewer that you are supposed to watch the character and not be influenced by the actor playing that character but I couldn't help myself in a particular scene that takes place in a bar. Hoping to raise some cash for their broken down car the girls don skimpy outfits and dance on top of tables during a karaoke competition. Lucy wants to hang out in the bar and party but Ben wants to get her out of there. This angers her and she gets drunk that night anyway and the next morning has to contend with a terrible hangover. I wondered is this Britney foreshadowing what is to become of her? Complicating things more is the fact that Jamie Lynn Spears, Britney's lil' sis plays a younger version of Lucy in the opening moments of the film. There are those who would say that Jamie Lynn has turned into her sister. Much like Mimi's plight in the film Jamie Lynn is young, unmarried, and a mother. Regardless of what was to come for the Spears sisters this film should be placed in a time capsule not unlike the one the girls bury in the beginning of the movie. It serves as a reminder of a time when Britney Spears was the biggest act in pop music who had her looks and unlimited potential working for her. For an hour and a half we can all live in that world again thanks to this wonderful movie.",3,Crossroads : An Appreciation,1201824000,"02 1, 2008",2008,4181,"['How', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'star', 'film', 'scriptwriter', 'Britney', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'breakdowns', 'comebacks', 'past', 'couple', 'years', 'hard', 'keep', 'track', 'Shonda', 'Rhimes', 'gone', 'create', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'started', 'writing', 'E.R', 'penned', 'girl', 'empowerment', 'film', 'film', 'testament', 'renewing', 'strengthening', 'one', 'friendships', 'film', 'very', 'powerful', 'moving', 'several', 'scenes', 'Take', 'example', 'moment', 'when', 'Lucy', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'sobbing', 'uncontrollably', 'bed', 'father', 'Dan', 'Akroyd', 'comfort', 'Lucy', 'graduation', 'day', 'been', 'voted', 'class', 'valedictorian', 'fun', 'things', 'missed', 'out', 'football', 'games', 'dances', 'when', 'was', 'studying', 'maintaining', 'good', 'grades', 'vulnerable', 'moment', 'father', 'trembling', 'voice', 'asks', 'Powerful', 'stuff', 'think', 'can', 'relate', 'Lucy', 'searching', 'lot', 'things', 'life', 'right', 'now', 'include', 'meaning', 'mother', 'who', 'walked', 'out', 'dad', 'when', 'was', 'only', 'small', 'child', 'support', 'friends', 'childhood', 'best', 'friends', 'Mimi', 'Taryn', 'Manning', 'Kit', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'abandoned', 'long', 'ago', 'think', 'too', 'innocent', 'keep', 'up', 'fast', 'lifestyles', 'Mimi', 'pregnant', 'yet', 'reveal', 'father', 'identity', 'Kit', 'engaged', 'boy', 'college', 'who', 'phone', 'graduation', 'party', 'girls', 'reunite', 'set', 'off', 'road', 'trip', 'When', 'were', 'little', 'buried', 'shoebox', 'full', 'artifacts', 'represented', 'dreams', 'future', 'Mimi', 'wanted', 'be', 'singer', 'Kit', 'beautiful', 'bride', 'Lucy', 'wanted', 'reconnect', 'mother', 'Mimi', 'going', 'music', 'audition', 'girls', 'much', 'convincing', 'part', 'agree', 'go', 'tell', 'will', 'be', 'backup', 'singers', 'one', 'other', 'motives', 'Lucy', 'will', 'hopefully', 'find', 'mom', 'Kit', 'will', 'visit', 'fiance', 'dorm', 'Mimi', 'already', 'arranged', 'transportation', 'girls', 'hunky', 'presence', 'Ben', 'Anson', 'Mount', 'Lucy', 'horrified', 'learn', 'Ben', 'was', 'pen', 'believed', 'have', 'murdered', 'man', 'girls', 'save', 'Mimi', 'are', 'terrified', 'be', 'same', 'car', 'let', 'alone', 'being', 'driven', 'state', 'lines', 'convicted', 'manslaughter', 'soon', 'learn', 'real', 'reason', 'incarceration', 'Ben', 'hit', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'assaulting', 'stepsister', 'points', 'Lucy', 'book', 'protective', 'sensitive', 'man', 'can', 'fall', 'love', 'Do', 'girls', 'make', 'destination', 'achieve', 'dreams', 'irrelevant', 'film', 'anything', 'journey', 'more', 'important', 'arriving', 'destination', 'What', 'learn', 'other', 'what', 'going', 'help', 'realize', 'dreams', 'live', 'happy', 'contented', 'lives', 'know', 'viewer', 'are', 'supposed', 'watch', 'character', 'not', 'be', 'influenced', 'actor', 'playing', 'character', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'myself', 'particular', 'scene', 'place', 'bar', 'Hoping', 'raise', 'cash', 'broken', 'down', 'car', 'girls', 'don', 'skimpy', 'outfits', 'dance', 'top', 'tables', 'karaoke', 'competition', 'Lucy', 'hang', 'out', 'bar', 'party', 'Ben', 'get', 'there', 'drunk', 'night', 'anyway', 'next', 'morning', 'contend', 'terrible', 'hangover', 'wondered', 'Britney', 'foreshadowing', 'what', 'become', 'Complicating', 'things', 'more', 'fact', 'Jamie', 'Lynn', 'Spears', 'Britney', 'lil', 'sis', 'younger', 'version', 'Lucy', 'opening', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'who', 'would', 'say', 'Jamie', 'Lynn', 'turned', 'sister', 'Much', 'Mimi', 'plight', 'film', 'Jamie', 'Lynn', 'young', 'unmarried', 'mother', 'Regardless', 'what', 'was', 'come', 'Spears', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'placed', 'time', 'capsule', 'not', 'one', 'girls', 'bury', 'beginning', 'movie', 'reminder', 'time', 'when', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'was', 'biggest', 'act', 'pop', 'music', 'who', 'had', 'looks', 'unlimited', 'potential', 'working', 'hour', 'half', 'can', 'live', 'world', 'again', 'thanks', 'wonderful', 'movie']",N/A
