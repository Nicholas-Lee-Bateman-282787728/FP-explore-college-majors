It simultaniously provides both the beginning and the possible ending of the title character. Richard Boone plays two parts which are essentially his younger and older self confronting each other.

He is from an important family but falls into disgrace and is eventually paid by his family not to go home. To stay away. He falls into a life of dueling, gambling and mercenary work. The episode shows the character hitting rock bottom in his youth, confronting his mistakes years later and possibly reaching a sort of redemption late in life.

Paladin stops the burglar and asks the burglar why he tried to steal from/kill him. He explains to Paladin that he has accrued a huge gambling debt...which reminds Paladin of a time long ago when he owed a huge gambling debt to Norge (played by William Conrad).
