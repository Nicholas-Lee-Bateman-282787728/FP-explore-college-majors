422202,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304438192,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Black comedies are usually controversial in tone.  How else could they really be considered `black', and yet there is something about `Citizen Ruth' that seems almost too extreme for its own good.  The subject of abortion is something that is so controversial because both sides of the equation (pro-life and pro-choice) are so firm and mostly aggressive in their beliefs.  I understand that the point of this film is to shed light on the insane steps that some do take to further their cause and so, in a way, this is nothing more than a darkly lit satire.  Still, this subject is hard to laugh at, and the script takes some situations too far, making it really hard to force a smile.Other than some of the outlandish dialog, I didn't find much about `Citizen Ruth' to be comedic at all.`Citizen Ruth' tells the story of a young, reckless drug addicted woman who is pregnant with yet another child (she has a few already that live with her brother) and facing criminal charges.  The judge suggests an abortion in exchange for leniency and this sparks a heated war between the `baby savers' and pro-choice advocates who leach onto this woman and exploit her for their own gain.  For me, there really wasn't room to make this a comedy, and so I'll admit to finding much of this rather uncomfortable.  Scenes depicting Ruth getting high and or drunk while knowingly pregnant are hard to stomach and certainly no laughing matter.  That said, watching character actors like Swoosie Kurtz, Kurtwood Smith and Mary Kay Place spar off in a battle of witty interchange is enjoyable to the hilt.I'm usually pretty pleased with Alexander Payne.  Despite loathing his most recent film (`The Descendants') I've found `Election', `About Schmidt' and `Sideways' to be some of the best films in their respective years.  Sadly, this one lacks the punch it needed and really should have been tonally shifted.  In fact, the approach he took to `The Descendants' (which was far more comedic than his usual fare) would have aided in this film's overall impact.Still, the cast is exceptional.  Laura Dern adds so many layers to Ruth and manages to highlight the dramatic tensions in her plight with ease, while exploiting her in a way that benefits the film and her scenes within it.  Mary Kay Place is my favorite supporting player here, her hysterical convictions are beautifully played out and play to the film's comedic efforts.  Sadly though, they can't save the script from being somewhat ill advised.  I don't think this is just because of a personal opinion (I am wholeheartedly pro-life and will never change that viewpoint for anything) but some may think that it is.  In the end, it was uneven and had glimmers of greatness, but I find this especially tonally challenged.",3,Uncomfortable...,1339372800,"06 11, 2012",2012,2761,"['Black', 'comedies', 'are', 'usually', 'controversial', 'tone', 'How', 'else', 'could', 'really', 'be', 'considered', 'black', 'yet', 'something', 'Citizen', 'Ruth', 'almost', 'too', 'extreme', 'own', 'good', 'subject', 'abortion', 'something', 'so', 'controversial', 'sides', 'equation', 'pro-life', 'pro-choice', 'are', 'so', 'firm', 'mostly', 'aggressive', 'beliefs', 'understand', 'point', 'film', 'shed', 'light', 'insane', 'steps', 'do', 'take', 'further', 'cause', 'so', 'way', 'nothing', 'more', 'darkly', 'lit', 'satire', 'Still', 'subject', 'hard', 'laugh', 'script', 'situations', 'too', 'far', 'making', 'really', 'hard', 'force', 'smile.Other', 'outlandish', 'dialog', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'much', 'Citizen', 'Ruth', 'be', 'comedic', 'all.', 'Citizen', 'Ruth', 'story', 'young', 'reckless', 'drug', 'addicted', 'woman', 'who', 'pregnant', 'yet', 'child', 'few', 'already', 'live', 'brother', 'facing', 'criminal', 'charges', 'judge', 'abortion', 'exchange', 'leniency', 'heated', 'war', 'baby', 'savers', 'pro-choice', 'advocates', 'who', 'leach', 'woman', 'exploit', 'own', 'gain', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'room', 'make', 'comedy', 'so', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'finding', 'much', 'rather', 'uncomfortable', 'Scenes', 'depicting', 'Ruth', 'getting', 'high', 'drunk', 'knowingly', 'pregnant', 'are', 'hard', 'stomach', 'certainly', 'laughing', 'matter', 'said', 'watching', 'character', 'actors', 'Swoosie', 'Kurtz', 'Kurtwood', 'Smith', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'spar', 'off', 'battle', 'witty', 'interchange', 'enjoyable', 'hilt.I', ""'m"", 'usually', 'pretty', 'pleased', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'loathing', 'most', 'recent', 'film', 'Descendants', ""'ve"", 'found', 'Election', 'Schmidt', 'Sideways', 'be', 'best', 'films', 'respective', 'years', 'Sadly', 'one', 'punch', 'needed', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'tonally', 'shifted', 'fact', 'approach', 'took', 'Descendants', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'comedic', 'usual', 'fare', 'would', 'have', 'aided', 'film', 'overall', 'impact.Still', 'cast', 'exceptional', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'so', 'many', 'layers', 'Ruth', 'manages', 'highlight', 'dramatic', 'tensions', 'plight', 'ease', 'exploiting', 'way', 'benefits', 'film', 'scenes', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'favorite', 'supporting', 'player', 'here', 'hysterical', 'convictions', 'are', 'beautifully', 'played', 'out', 'play', 'film', 'comedic', 'efforts', 'Sadly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'script', 'being', 'somewhat', 'ill', 'advised', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'just', 'personal', 'opinion', 'am', 'wholeheartedly', 'pro-life', 'will', 'never', 'change', 'viewpoint', 'anything', 'may', 'think', 'end', 'was', 'uneven', 'had', 'glimmers', 'greatness', 'find', 'especially', 'tonally', 'challenged']",Citizen Ruth VHS

Almost every character (none them a positive one)is a caricature and portrayed to perfection by the highly recognizable actors who play them. The movie offends everyone and that is its appeal!!!Laura Dern is outstanding in her role as the dim and drugged Ruth Stoops, utterly oblivious to the issues and to those who want only to use her to achieve their own ends. Ruth could care less about a ""cause"" --all she wants is money and a way to get high.This movie points out the absolute disrespect that zealots who blindly follow a ""cause""  have for individual rights and free choice. They see everything in black-or-white and have no room for others' thoughts and just feel the need to control others' lives. To Payne's credit, however, there is no good side or bad side in this movie, and no pat ending either.There is a lot of truth covered over by humor in this movie, and many things said that could never have been voiced in a more conventional film.

422206,A95SF04RX9G8,6304438192,"Christopher Moyer ""moyer.privatjokr.com""","[8, 10]","Abortion is always a difficult topic to tackle, because its two extreme sides - pro-life and pro-choice - have a ""you're either with us or against us and there's no in-between"" mentality. Alexander Payne's Citizen Ruth is a political satire that does not take a stand on either side of the fence, instead choosing to remain neutral and expose the absurdities of each side.Ruth Stoops (Laura Dern) is the very definition of troubled: an unemployed, drug-addled drifter with four children who were all taken away from her because she can't seem to get her life together. She's picked up for huffing and finds out that she's pregnant again, and the judge wants to impose a harsher sentence on her for endangering the fetus. This becomes a big news story, and soon Ruth finds herself being tugged at from both sides of the abortion issue.Ruth is taken in first by the pro-life Norm and Gail Stoney, played by Mary Kay Place and Kurtwood Smith, whose intention it is to convince Ruth to have the baby. They want to help her get her life together, and offer her the guest room in their modest house as refuge from the sea of reporters that want the scoop on Ruth's story. All Ruth wants is to be left alone and to keep her life private. Oh, but she also wants to get high all the time to escape her life.After Ruth has some difficulty with the Stoneys, another member of the pro-life commmitte, Diane Siegler (Swoosie Kurtz), takes Ruth in, and reveals that she is actually an undercover agent for the pro-choice force. The tug of war then kicks off in earnest, with the pro-lifers offering a large cash reward to Ruth for having the baby, and the pro-choicers attempting to match it. All the while, neither side really seems to care much about Ruth at all; they're more concerned with their own agendas.Now, nothing I have said here indicates that this is actually a comedy, but there are several laugh-out-loud moments. However, director/co-writer Alexander Payne, in this, his first film, and his later films, never attempts to design scenarios simply to make the audience laugh. He's more concerned with exposing situations, and if comedy results, then so be it. In my opinion, it's a great way of doing comedy: make the laughs come from putting characters in situations that they would avoid if they could, but circumstances rule that there is no alternative.It's kind of difficult to universally recommend a movie like Citizen Ruth, because of the subject matter. A lot of people will say that abortion is not something you should joke about, and I absolutely agree with them. However, if you can see past the subject of abortion and instead consider this film as a study in herd mentality, I think it can be rewarding.",4,Very good satire tackling the tough topic of abortion,1110153600,"03 7, 2005",2005,2719,"['Abortion', 'always', 'difficult', 'topic', 'tackle', 'two', 'extreme', 'sides', 'pro-life', 'pro-choice', 'have', ""'re"", 'in-between', 'mentality', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'Citizen', 'Ruth', 'political', 'satire', 'not', 'take', 'stand', 'side', 'fence', 'instead', 'choosing', 'remain', 'neutral', 'expose', 'absurdities', 'side.Ruth', 'Stoops', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'very', 'definition', 'troubled', 'unemployed', 'drug-addled', 'drifter', 'four', 'children', 'who', 'were', 'taken', 'away', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'life', 'together', 'picked', 'up', 'huffing', 'out', 'pregnant', 'again', 'judge', 'impose', 'harsher', 'sentence', 'endangering', 'fetus', 'big', 'news', 'story', 'soon', 'Ruth', 'being', 'tugged', 'sides', 'abortion', 'issue.Ruth', 'taken', 'first', 'pro-life', 'Norm', 'Gail', 'Stoney', 'played', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'Kurtwood', 'Smith', 'intention', 'convince', 'Ruth', 'have', 'baby', 'want', 'help', 'get', 'life', 'together', 'offer', 'guest', 'room', 'modest', 'house', 'refuge', 'sea', 'reporters', 'want', 'scoop', 'Ruth', 'story', 'Ruth', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'keep', 'life', 'private', 'Oh', 'also', 'get', 'high', 'time', 'escape', 'life.After', 'Ruth', 'difficulty', 'Stoneys', 'member', 'pro-life', 'commmitte', 'Diane', 'Siegler', 'Swoosie', 'Kurtz', 'Ruth', 'reveals', 'actually', 'undercover', 'agent', 'pro-choice', 'force', 'tug', 'war', 'then', 'off', 'earnest', 'pro-lifers', 'offering', 'large', 'cash', 'reward', 'Ruth', 'having', 'baby', 'pro-choicers', 'attempting', 'match', 'while', 'side', 'really', 'care', 'much', 'Ruth', ""'re"", 'more', 'concerned', 'own', 'agendas.Now', 'nothing', 'have', 'said', 'here', 'actually', 'comedy', 'are', 'several', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'However', 'director/co-writer', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'first', 'film', 'later', 'films', 'never', 'design', 'scenarios', 'simply', 'make', 'audience', 'laugh', 'more', 'concerned', 'exposing', 'situations', 'comedy', 'results', 'then', 'so', 'be', 'opinion', 'great', 'way', 'doing', 'comedy', 'make', 'laughs', 'come', 'putting', 'characters', 'situations', 'would', 'avoid', 'could', 'circumstances', 'rule', 'alternative.It', 'kind', 'difficult', 'universally', 'recommend', 'movie', 'Citizen', 'Ruth', 'subject', 'matter', 'lot', 'people', 'will', 'say', 'abortion', 'not', 'something', 'should', 'joke', 'absolutely', 'agree', 'However', 'can', 'see', 'subject', 'abortion', 'instead', 'consider', 'film', 'study', 'herd', 'mentality', 'think', 'can', 'be', 'rewarding']",Citizen Ruth VHS

Laura Dern is excellent and convincing in her role as Ruth Stoops, a confused and not very bright woman, who has an addiction to inhalants. You see her eyes positively light up when she sees a hardware store, full of spray paints and airplane model glue, etc. She is homeless, and the children she already has have been taken away from her. When the police find her passed out after ""huffing"" they take her to the hospital and then arrest her, again. Everyone knows her because this is not the first time. They also know this will probably not be the last time. Ruth discovers she is pregnant while at the hospital, and here is where the story turns. What starts as a story about Ruth and her problems becomes more a story about politics, morality and how society deals with a woman's rights to choose (or not to choose). The judge in her case tells Ruth to do everyone a favour and get rid of the baby, even granting her permission to visit a doctor to obtain an abortion. He indicates he may give her a lighter sentence if she aborts because she will ultimately be doing society a favour by getting rid of an unwanted child. Ruth is perpetually confused. Ruth is bailed out of jail by well-meaning Christian anti-abortion activists who put her up in their home (well played by Mary Kay Place and the man who plays the father on tv's That 70s Show as well as the father of Neil in the 1989 movie Dead Poet's Society). They do everything in their power to convince Ruth to keep the child, but Ruth is more interested in getting high (still). After she basically assaults the Christian family's son, another of the anti-abortion protesters, played by Swoosie Kurtz, offers to take Ruth in.Once she gets Ruth home she confesses that she is really a pro-choice activist posing as a pro-life activist. This throws Ruth for a loop. Ruth has already been pulled in several directions, and she can barely handle the everyday onslaught of reality as it is.Soon the Christian family discovers Kurtz's deception and organises a massive protest outside Kurtz's home. Matters only escalate from there. Both sides are fighting for Ruth's unborn child, but they are losing sight of the woman herself, offering to bribe her to have the child or not have the child. It becomes a media circus...The story is well written, the actors are all fantastic, and the film brings to light some of the more human issues at the heart of the ongoing abortion debate.",4,A WOMAN'S RIGHTS VERSUS SOCIETAL ISSUES,1000771200,"09 18, 2001",2001,2548,"['Creative', 'well-done', 'well-cast', 'film', 'up', 'lot', 'questions', 'American', 'society', 'not', 'like', 'face', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'excellent', 'convincing', 'role', 'Ruth', 'Stoops', 'confused', 'not', 'very', 'bright', 'woman', 'who', 'addiction', 'inhalants', 'see', 'eyes', 'positively', 'light', 'up', 'when', 'hardware', 'store', 'full', 'spray', 'paints', 'airplane', 'model', 'glue', 'etc', 'homeless', 'children', 'already', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'away', 'When', 'police', 'find', 'passed', 'out', 'huffing', 'take', 'hospital', 'then', 'arrest', 'again', 'Everyone', 'not', 'first', 'time', 'also', 'know', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'be', 'last', 'time', 'Ruth', 'pregnant', 'hospital', 'here', 'where', 'story', 'What', 'story', 'Ruth', 'problems', 'more', 'story', 'politics', 'morality', 'how', 'society', 'deals', 'woman', 'rights', 'choose', 'not', 'choose', 'judge', 'case', 'Ruth', 'do', 'everyone', 'favour', 'get', 'rid', 'baby', 'even', 'granting', 'permission', 'visit', 'doctor', 'obtain', 'abortion', 'may', 'give', 'lighter', 'sentence', 'will', 'ultimately', 'be', 'doing', 'society', 'favour', 'getting', 'rid', 'unwanted', 'child', 'Ruth', 'perpetually', 'confused', 'Ruth', 'bailed', 'jail', 'well-meaning', 'Christian', 'anti-abortion', 'activists', 'who', 'put', 'up', 'home', 'well', 'played', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'man', 'who', 'father', 'tv', '70s', 'Show', 'as', 'well', 'father', 'Neil', '1989', 'movie', 'Dead', 'Poet', 'Society', 'do', 'everything', 'power', 'convince', 'Ruth', 'keep', 'child', 'Ruth', 'more', 'interested', 'getting', 'high', 'still', 'basically', 'assaults', 'Christian', 'family', 'son', 'anti-abortion', 'protesters', 'played', 'Swoosie', 'Kurtz', 'take', 'Ruth', 'in.Once', 'Ruth', 'home', 'really', 'pro-choice', 'activist', 'posing', 'pro-life', 'activist', 'Ruth', 'loop', 'Ruth', 'already', 'been', 'pulled', 'several', 'directions', 'can', 'barely', 'handle', 'everyday', 'onslaught', 'reality', 'Christian', 'family', 'Kurtz', 'deception', 'massive', 'protest', 'Kurtz', 'home', 'Matters', 'only', 'escalate', 'there', 'sides', 'are', 'fighting', 'Ruth', 'unborn', 'child', 'are', 'losing', 'sight', 'woman', 'offering', 'bribe', 'have', 'child', 'not', 'have', 'child', 'media', 'circus', 'story', 'well', 'written', 'actors', 'are', 'fantastic', 'film', 'light', 'more', 'human', 'issues', 'heart', 'ongoing', 'abortion', 'debate']",Citizen Ruth VHS

422209,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,6304438192,Gregor von Kallahann,"[2, 3]","Having seen ELECTION previously and now, finally, catching up with CITIZEN RUTH, I can't help getting excited about the work of filmmaker Alexander Payne.  In both cases, the initial buzz on the films seemed positive, but in neither case, did I feel the need to rush right out to see them.  An abortion comedy?  A  high school student council election used as a pretext to make a larger statement about ethics in contemporary American political lifez/  Frankly, the chances of either film being pulled off successfully did not seem so good.But Payne and co-sreenwriter Jim Taylor succeeded beyond expectation both times out.  These are films that take no prisoners.  It's not surprising that in the case of RUTH, many viewers focus on the equal-opportunity skewering that both sides of the abortion debate receive.  All true, but the characters are not quite the stereotypical cut-out figures that some have suggested.  While Mary Kay Place as a fundamentalist pro-lifer may seem an obvious choice, and Swoosie Kurtz's performance as a radical pro-choicer may seem standard-issue at first, both the script and the individual performances are so full of deft touches and subtle embellishments, that their characters' self-contradictory humanity finally does begin to emerge.Caught up in the abortion rights maelstrom is the hapless Ruth Stoops, a homeless drug addict and four-time pronounced unfit mother, who finds herself facing felony charges of 'fetal abuse' after a routine physical examination after a drug bust finds her pregnant once again.  At least one review I found poking around the Net, suggested that the theme was getting a little &quot;old&quot; by the time of this film's release in 1996.  The &quot;fetal abuse&quot; charge, however, is precisely the element that made the film au courant.  The 'fetal rights' argument has been used increasingly in recent years to advance the pro-life cause.Satire has its own special demands on actors, but turning in a multi-layered performance is not usually one of them.  As suggested above, actors like Kurtz and Place are given some opportunity to do just that and you'll catch those moments if you don't blink.  But in the title role Laura Dern is given that privelege throughout.  Ruth is certainly slow-witted and morally immature, but Payne and Taylor wisely give her just enough self-awareness to make her interesting.  And Dern does not play her too broadly.  The satire takes on life around this authentic seeming character, almost despite her.

Well, director Payne and his co-scenarist Jim Taylor have a LOT to say about abortion, women's bodies and the issues of individuals versus groupthink.I loved this movie!  Laura Dern is genuinely funny and quirky as the slow-witted Ruth Stoops, who finds herself at storm center as a judge convicts her of criminal negligence to her unborn fetus. However, out of court, he advises her to ""take care of this problem,"" sotto voce telling her to get an abortion.  Ruth doesn't really care; she just wants to find some Krylon or airplane glue to inhale.Finding herself in jail, some Christian pro-lifers take her under their wing.  Suddenly, she is no longer a rational actor whose free will determines the birth of her baby, but a pawn in a PR war between pro-life and pro-choice zealots.  It is as if Ruth doesn't even exist as an individual, and is only important to these fanatics as a poster child for their respective causes.What I most love about the characterisations of the activists is how Payne shows how removed they are from reality.  The pro-lifers (Mary Kay Place and that guy from That 70s Show) are Christian evangelicals who won't even have a TV in their house, hold independent church services at their house and sing horrifyingly bad hymns like ""Yes Jesus Loves Me, The Bible Tells Me So"" (this hokum is probably the main reason people become atheists; whatever happened to church hymns by Bach or Cesar Franck?)  Their clothes are right out of the Monkey Wards 1977 catalogue and they speak in that anti-intellectual sing-song style.The pro-choicers are just as big a scream.  Swoosie Kurtz plays a ""double agent"" who spends months undercover as a tacky Christian hick in order to kidnap one of the women whose pregnancy the pro-lifers intend to bring to term.  Once she has Ruth at her house, the wig comes off and she becomes her real self, a somewhat butch lesbian with a bookish feminist lesbian lover.  I love the scene when they sing a moon hymn to Gaia.Eventually, this boils over into a national media circus, and we get a couple of campy cameos from Burt Reynolds as President of the Baby Savers and my own Hitchcock goddess, Tippi Hedren as the President of Pro-Choice.Of course, Payne's message is the REAL pro-choice message, that the rights of individuals are what should be protected, not the groupthink of movement activists, whose lives would be empty without having a cause to blindly follow.  This movie shows the ultimate disdain and disrespect such groups have for rational, individual choice and common sense.  Payne's moral center of the movie is a Vietnam vet and biker who -- though a fervent pro-choicer -- sees through the zealotry of both sides and treats Ruth as an individual, and gives her the ""tough love"" she needs, instead of patronising her.One of the things I like about this movie is that Payne presents us with _sincere_ activists, who make pretty good points for both sides.  And that's where most Americans are; they're not _absolutely_ pro-life nor _absolutely_ pro-choice.  But, reaching that point-of-view would take THOUGHT, which most rabid activists are incapable of.I found this VHS (could not find DVD) is only available used, and is currently not in print.  How sad!  I hope Miramax is planning a new release.  I have this movie on LaserDisc, and what a great introduction to Payne's ascerbic wit and keen visual sense that comes to full fruition in ""Election.""",4,Alexander Payne's Allegorical Farce,1026604800,"07 14, 2002",2002,3564,"['One', 'most', 'oft-repeated', 'cliches', 'pro', 'choice', 'movement', 'line', 'men', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'say', 'abortion', 'woman', 'body', 'Well', 'director', 'Payne', 'co-scenarist', 'Jim', 'Taylor', 'have', 'LOT', 'say', 'abortion', 'women', 'bodies', 'issues', 'individuals', 'versus', 'groupthink.I', 'loved', 'movie', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'quirky', 'slow-witted', 'Ruth', 'Stoops', 'who', 'storm', 'center', 'judge', 'criminal', 'negligence', 'unborn', 'fetus', 'However', 'court', 'take', 'care', 'problem', 'voce', 'telling', 'get', 'abortion', 'Ruth', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'just', 'find', 'Krylon', 'airplane', 'glue', 'inhale.Finding', 'jail', 'Christian', 'pro-lifers', 'take', 'wing', 'Suddenly', 'no', 'longer', 'rational', 'actor', 'free', 'will', 'determines', 'birth', 'baby', 'pawn', 'PR', 'war', 'pro-life', 'pro-choice', 'zealots', 'Ruth', ""n't"", 'even', 'exist', 'individual', 'only', 'important', 'fanatics', 'poster', 'child', 'respective', 'causes.What', 'most', 'love', 'characterisations', 'activists', 'how', 'Payne', 'how', 'removed', 'are', 'reality', 'pro-lifers', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'guy', '70s', 'Show', 'are', 'Christian', 'evangelicals', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'TV', 'house', 'hold', 'independent', 'church', 'services', 'house', 'sing', 'horrifyingly', 'bad', 'hymns', 'Yes', 'Jesus', 'Me', 'Bible', 'Tells', 'Me', 'So', 'hokum', 'probably', 'main', 'reason', 'people', 'become', 'atheists', 'happened', 'church', 'hymns', 'Bach', 'Cesar', 'Franck', 'clothes', 'are', 'right', 'Monkey', 'Wards', '1977', 'catalogue', 'speak', 'anti-intellectual', 'sing-song', 'style.The', 'pro-choicers', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'big', 'scream', 'Swoosie', 'Kurtz', 'double', 'agent', 'who', 'months', 'undercover', 'tacky', 'Christian', 'hick', 'order', 'kidnap', 'one', 'women', 'pregnancy', 'pro-lifers', 'intend', 'bring', 'term', 'Ruth', 'house', 'wig', 'off', 'real', 'self', 'somewhat', 'butch', 'lesbian', 'bookish', 'feminist', 'lesbian', 'lover', 'love', 'scene', 'when', 'sing', 'moon', 'hymn', 'Gaia.Eventually', 'over', 'national', 'media', 'circus', 'get', 'couple', 'campy', 'cameos', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'President', 'Baby', 'Savers', 'own', 'Hitchcock', 'goddess', 'Tippi', 'Hedren', 'President', 'Pro-Choice.Of', 'course', 'Payne', 'message', 'REAL', 'pro-choice', 'message', 'rights', 'individuals', 'are', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'protected', 'not', 'groupthink', 'movement', 'activists', 'lives', 'would', 'be', 'empty', 'having', 'cause', 'blindly', 'follow', 'movie', 'ultimate', 'disdain', 'disrespect', 'such', 'groups', 'have', 'rational', 'individual', 'choice', 'common', 'sense', 'Payne', 'moral', 'center', 'movie', 'Vietnam', 'vet', 'biker', 'who', 'fervent', 'pro-choicer', 'zealotry', 'sides', 'treats', 'Ruth', 'individual', 'tough', 'love', 'instead', 'patronising', 'her.One', 'things', 'like', 'movie', 'Payne', '_sincere_', 'activists', 'who', 'make', 'pretty', 'good', 'points', 'sides', 'where', 'most', 'Americans', 'are', ""'re"", 'not', '_absolutely_', 'pro-life', '_absolutely_', 'pro-choice', 'reaching', 'point-of-view', 'would', 'take', 'THOUGHT', 'most', 'rabid', 'activists', 'are', 'incapable', 'of.I', 'found', 'VHS', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'DVD', 'only', 'available', 'used', 'currently', 'not', 'print', 'How', 'sad', 'hope', 'Miramax', 'planning', 'new', 'release', 'have', 'movie', 'LaserDisc', 'what', 'great', 'introduction', 'Payne', 'ascerbic', 'wit', 'keen', 'visual', 'sense', 'full', 'fruition', 'Election']",Citizen Ruth VHS

Laura Dern is perfect as the angry, drug-addicted and pregnant Ruth, who becomes a pawn in the political war between professional pro-life and pro-choice activists. Declared an unfit mother by a court, Ruth is encouraged to have an abortion. She is ""rescued"" by a swarmy, too-nice couple who, of course, turn out to be fanatical pro-lifers. They embark upon a full-fledged campaign to change Ruth's mind, which includes making her watch a film of a fetus being destroyed. As her case gains publicity, she is soon appropriated by the other side. The pro-choicers turn out to be equally fanatical and ideology-driven. Soon Ruth is being offered money by both sides, to either have or abort her baby. What makes the film work so well is the way Ruth's deadpan street attitude sharply contrasts with everyone around her. She is utterly oblivious to the issues and movements which with they are obsessed. This perfectly illustrates the sharp separation that necessarily exists between causes and real life. Ruth is an actual, if not wholly sympathetic person; to the activists around her, she is only a symbol to be used in their campaigns. Citizen Ruth brings this point home in a way that is entertaining and very funny. It is one of those movies with an extremely unlikely plot that is so smoothly executed that it seems believable as you watch it.

422221,A4JHEO7H330AF,6304438192,Tom Brody,"[1, 1]","The movie is about a glue-sniffing, aerosol-huffing, homeless pregnant woman.  Near the beginning of the story ""Ruth"" visits her ex-husband's home. Inside, one can see two of the woman's children.  But the ex-husband does not let her inside and he chases her away, she starts to cry, and the man gives her $15.00.  Then we see Ruth enter a hardware store and steal an aerosol can, for the purpose of huffing the fumes.  She sniffs the fumes from a brown paper bag.  Then, to add to the woman's adventures, she is taken to jail, and is found to be pregnant.  The judge gives her the choice of getting an abortion or spending time in jail. This sets the tone for the rest of the movie.  Ruth is ""adopted"" by a pro-choice family. The husband's daytime job is clerk in a hardware store.  He is skillful at spouting Christian aphorisms.  Intrigue is introduced into the story by a short, one-minute sequence, where the man is briefly possessed by lust for Ruth.  (Ruth's only redeeming feature is that she has a slender waist.)The bulk of the movie is occupied by amusing, cartoonish, stereotypical behaviors of the Christian pro-lifers who allow Ruth to live with them for several days, and by an opposing group of people who eventually ""adopt"" Ruth as her own.  The second group of people are pro-abortionists.  They comprise a curious melange of a Vietnam veteran (with a prosthetic leg, and possessing a hefty Agent Orange settlement), two lesbians, and a young man.  The pro-lifers stage a sit-in just outside the property of the home of the pro-abortionists.Most of the movie is like a souffle busily rising in the oven.  One realizes that the souffle is a culinary work of art, but one is aware that it might collapse at any moment.  The acting of the pro-lifers and of the pro-abortionists is very good.  It is amazing how the script-writer and director turned this sort of unpleasant controversy into a cartoonish comedy that dwells on sterotypes.  But it seems to hang together.At any rate, Ruth spontaneously aborts, resulting in the entire controversy between the pro-lifers and the pro-abortionists being rendered moot.  Ruth's friends bring her to an abortion clinic (though they are not aware of the spontaneous abortion).  The clinic is surrounded by pro-lifer demonstrators.  Once in the clinic, Ruth jumps out the window, sneaks past the crowd of demonstrators, and the film ends by showing her running into the distance.  There is no question that Ruth will resume her earlier life as an aerosol-huffing vagrant.

The supporting cast is spot-on, especially Swoosie Kurtz as a woman who snatches Ruth away from the Baby Savers group by tricking them into thinking she is on their side.What's most refreshing about this wacky comedy is that the audience is not pushed to take a side, nor does it try to beat you over the head with a message or draw you into one camp or the other. Both extremist groups are using Ruth for their own purposes, when in the end it is really her decision as to what she will do with her ill-advised pregnancy.Kudos to the writer and director for coming up with a dark comedy that isn't afraid to skewer the hypocrites and users.",5,Doesn't take sides or push you to pick one,1268870400,"03 18, 2010",2010,806,"['Laura', 'Dern', 'hoot', 'Ruth', 'Stoops', 'foul-mouthed', 'huffing', 'drinking', 'homeless', 'skank', 'who', 'pregnant', 'fifth', 'child', 'previous', 'four', 'having', 'been', 'adopted', 'supporting', 'cast', 'spot-on', 'especially', 'Swoosie', 'Kurtz', 'woman', 'who', 'Ruth', 'away', 'Baby', 'Savers', 'group', 'tricking', 'thinking', 'side.What', 'most', 'refreshing', 'wacky', 'comedy', 'audience', 'not', 'pushed', 'take', 'side', 'try', 'beat', 'head', 'message', 'draw', 'one', 'camp', 'other', 'extremist', 'groups', 'are', 'using', 'Ruth', 'own', 'purposes', 'when', 'end', 'really', 'decision', 'what', 'will', 'do', 'ill-advised', 'pregnancy.Kudos', 'writer', 'director', 'coming', 'up', 'dark', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'skewer', 'hypocrites', 'users']",Citizen Ruth VHS

Red,"[3, 13]","I did not much enjoy this film, and I didn't find it very clever or funny.It's true, as other amazon reviewers have noted, that Citizen Ruth stereotypes both sides of the abortion issue. Does that make it an intelligent and even-handed comic treatment of a complex topic? No, indeed.Along the way, it also stereotypes poor people, middle class people, teenagers, drug addicts, Christians, and Vietnam veterans. That doesn't make it funny, though, because the satire is so heavy-handed and predictable. Simply tackling an important social topic, like abortion, isn't going to give a film the heft to generate either drama or humor. In my opinion, the film's pretentious take on a big issue just makes it creepy. There were too many close-ups of earnest, wide-pored, and angry faces. And Burt Reynolds as the national leader of the anti-abortion crowd was just peculiar. What was he doing in this film? And what are we supposed to make of his relationship with the young Eric?Laura Dern is a talented actress, and she does a creditable job with this part -- which because it straddles genres was a challenging one. But her talent couldn't redeem this film for me.",2,"Heavy-handed, Predictable, and Not Funny",1144540800,"04 9, 2006",2006,1161,"['did', 'not', 'much', 'enjoy', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'very', 'clever', 'funny.It', 'true', 'other', 'amazon', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'Citizen', 'Ruth', 'sides', 'abortion', 'issue', 'make', 'intelligent', 'even-handed', 'comic', 'treatment', 'complex', 'topic', 'No', 'indeed.Along', 'way', 'also', 'poor', 'people', 'middle', 'class', 'people', 'teenagers', 'drug', 'addicts', 'Christians', 'Vietnam', 'veterans', ""n't"", 'make', 'funny', 'though', 'satire', 'so', 'heavy-handed', 'predictable', 'Simply', 'tackling', 'important', 'social', 'topic', 'abortion', ""n't"", 'going', 'give', 'film', 'heft', 'generate', 'drama', 'humor', 'opinion', 'film', 'pretentious', 'take', 'big', 'issue', 'just', 'creepy', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'close-ups', 'earnest', 'wide-pored', 'angry', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'national', 'leader', 'anti-abortion', 'crowd', 'was', 'just', 'peculiar', 'What', 'was', 'doing', 'film', 'are', 'supposed', 'make', 'relationship', 'young', 'Eric', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'talented', 'actress', 'creditable', 'job', 'part', 'genres', 'was', 'challenging', 'one', 'talent', 'could', ""n't"", 'redeem', 'film']",Citizen Ruth VHS
