1085124,AQJAILPTX1DB2,B000S2XD9U,Anonymous,"[1, 2]","The three-star rating is a reflection of the video and audio quality, NOT the series itself, which is easily 5-star!  The series is more than 30 years old, and the video and audio quality aren't of today's higher standards, but the discs play quite well on an upscaling blu-ray player.  Picture and sound are actually quite good, and the subtitles (in clear, unobtrusive white print) are helpful.  Believe it or not, there are many sections of dialogue displayed with CORRECT grammar even when dialogue is deliberately spoken with poor grammar!The series is also quite endearing as well as funny, due to surprising character development throughout.  Delboy, the main character, and his much younger brother Rodney share a public housing apartment with their grandfather.  All the illegal money-making schemes Delboy riggs to care for himself, his brother, and his grandfather are very funny on their own, and the outcomes often hysterical.  Much to my surprise, however, Delboy also frequently displays genuine concern for his brother Rodney and his grandfather!  The cast is VERY good.Regarding packaging, it would be helpful if the complete series was in a digi-pak, but it isn't, so be prepared to condense the amount of shelf space the series takes up by repacking the discs in slim cases, all 18 of 'em, currently packed in a large, unwieldy cardboard box containing 5 separate cases (two of which also are cardboard!) of three to four discs each.The  current price the complete series is being offered for on Amazon ($75 as of July-August 2012) is finally affordable...if you are interested in the complete series.

1085125,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B000S2XD9U,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[4, 4]","With this series I discovered two of my favorite English actors in situation comedy. These were David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst, playing two brothers living in a council flat in London.  Their grandfather lives with them too.  Jason is Del-Boy, the elder brother and he is the smarter brother.  It is stretching things to call him smart but compared to Rodney, the younger brother he is.  Del-Boy lives by trading junk.  Rodney is considerably younger than he.  Since their mother died young, Del-Boy has had to raise Rodney.  There are a whole host of other characters, mostly people in their neighborhood, and they revolve around the brothers.  That is just the broad outline for one of the most hilarious sitcoms to ever grace a tv screen.  Del-Boy and Rodney are just a great comedy duo and I can understand why this was such a hit in the UK.  Another great thing about this show for Americans is that you see a whole different class of English people whom we don't usually get to see.  These are the people on the lower end of the spectrum, which is not the stuff of MASTERPIECE THEATER, to put it mildly. I became such a fan of the brothers that I chased down their other work in other years.  Jason has appeared in tons of other things but where he stood out equally as well is in A TOUCH OF FROST.  He is just a wonderful actor.

1085127,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B000S2XD9U,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[1, 1]","ONLY FOOLS AND HORSES premiered in the early 1980s, at a time when Thatcherism was just beginning to take hold in Great Britain.  As portrayed by David Jason, Del Trotter wanted to join the ever-growing throng of yuppies making loadsamoney and spending it on champagne and women.  The only snag was that he could hardly survive in his chosen profession of buying and selling with his company Trotter Independent Traders (or TIT for short).  John Sullivan's comedy was one of the BBC's best-loved series, running for over two decades in total.  It made a star out of Nicholas Lyndhurst, while proving that David Jason was a fine dramatic as well as a comic actor, able to cope with different situations.  Mention must also be made of Lennard Pearce (later Buster Merryfield): neither of them were well-known actors, but their contribution to this family comedy must not be underestimated.  ONLY FOOLS AND HORSES conjured up a seedy South London world of dodgy deals and shady characters - all of them lovable in their own way, yet always living on the breadline.  The comedy had a social realism often missing from sitcoms of an earlier period, which helps to explain why it attracted huge audiences.",5,Classic Comedy of the Thatcherite Era,1364947200,"04 3, 2013",2013,1199,"['ONLY', 'FOOLS', 'AND', 'HORSES', 'premiered', 'early', '1980s', 'time', 'when', 'Thatcherism', 'was', 'just', 'beginning', 'take', 'hold', 'Great', 'Britain', 'portrayed', 'David', 'Jason', 'Del', 'Trotter', 'wanted', 'join', 'ever-growing', 'throng', 'yuppies', 'making', 'loadsamoney', 'spending', 'champagne', 'women', 'only', 'snag', 'was', 'could', 'hardly', 'survive', 'chosen', 'profession', 'buying', 'selling', 'company', 'Trotter', 'Independent', 'Traders', 'TIT', 'short', 'John', 'Sullivan', 'comedy', 'was', 'one', 'BBC', 'best-loved', 'series', 'running', 'two', 'decades', 'total', 'made', 'star', 'Nicholas', 'Lyndhurst', 'proving', 'David', 'Jason', 'was', 'fine', 'dramatic', 'as', 'well', 'comic', 'actor', 'able', 'cope', 'different', 'situations', 'Mention', 'must', 'also', 'be', 'made', 'Lennard', 'Pearce', 'later', 'Buster', 'Merryfield', 'were', 'well-known', 'actors', 'contribution', 'family', 'comedy', 'must', 'not', 'be', 'underestimated', 'ONLY', 'FOOLS', 'AND', 'HORSES', 'conjured', 'up', 'seedy', 'South', 'London', 'world', 'dodgy', 'deals', 'shady', 'characters', 'lovable', 'own', 'way', 'yet', 'always', 'living', 'breadline', 'comedy', 'had', 'social', 'realism', 'often', 'missing', 'sitcoms', 'earlier', 'period', 'explain', 'why', 'attracted', 'huge', 'audiences']",Only Fools and Horses: The Complete Collection

It started in 1981 and ended in 2003, but unlike American series it didn't drown the watcher and the last three episodes were a year apart! There was even one 3 year gap between 1993 and 1996 and one 5 year gap between 1996 and 2001 before they took up the series again. Never have I seen such continuity in story lines. It is amazing to me that the same actors kept coming back year after year to create this wonderful body of work. It deserved every award and accolade it ever got and those were many.The first few seasons were half hour comedies and are hilarious, but you soon get to know these characters and become emotionally invested in their stories especially when they expand to full hour shows. By season 4 I was not just laughing, but crying. ""Only Fools and Horses"" succeeded in being both hilarious and extremely endearing. We are so lucky that we get to watch their stories unfold completely without having to wait 22 years. Best of all it answers the big questions and ties it all together by the final episodes. I can't imagine how invested people must have been who waited 22 years to get their answers. I know not everyone will like this series.
