498305,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00000F4EU,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","The first two paragraphs are taken from a review of Dalton Trumbo's novelistic treatment of the film under review. The points made here apply in general to the film:""The subject of war has had all sorts of novelistic treatments, the most successful usually treading lightly on the war action itself and delving into the personal choices and consequences of the characters as their central aim. In that odd sense the most compelling novelistic treatments are either pro-war (for some seemingly rational reason like defending one's country, coming to the aid of a smaller, weaker country, etc.) or neutral to the more physical and psychological dimensions of the situation. A flat out, anti-war (or, to use a more vague term, pacifistic) treatment is usually not successful either because it has a ""preaching to the choir"" quality or strikes some false chord. That is not the case with Dalton Trumbo's ""Johnny Got His Gun"".Although this novel was written under the sign of the Hitler-Stalin Pact in the late 1930s, reflected in Communist International and American Communist Party political line as one of intense opposition to Western war preparations it brings more home truths than merely another piece of `communistic' propaganda and it would be incorrect even for staunch anti-Stalinists to dismiss it out of hand. Joe, the main character here, maimed beyond belief and repair, is every mother's son, every American mother's son. His interior monologue, as he remembers his past, his lost youth, his desires and the useless way he was used in the last days of World War I is almost unique in the way the story unfolds. It certainly is not for the faint-hearted, or the weak-minded. As steps are now being taken to up the ante in Afghanistan, another one of those wars to `defend' democracy, or whatever the reason of the day is, this thing should be required reading for every mother, and every mother's son and daughter who seeks to put him or herself in war's way.""The film pretty faithfully follows Trumbo's, or at least the spirit of Trumbo's, main point. Off a reading, or rather re-reading of the novel I thought that it would be hard to sustain a film based on the lack of ""action"" in the story line. That is dealt with two ways-flash backs by Joe to sunnier times and by ""dream"" sequences featuring the likes of Donald Sutherland, as Jesus, giving his droll interpretation of Trumbo's message. This is not an easy film to get through; certainly not for those who like their entertainments light, but the pathos of the scenes as Joe tries to make sense of his ""new"" world is cause for reflection. That said, could one find a better actor than Timothy Bottoms to play the role of Joe, the fresh-faced ""dough boy"" filled with illusions, filled with thoughts of invincibility, but also filled with dreams and sorrows as he goes off to war. Kudos here. And thanks, brother Trumbo",5,A Powerful Anti-War Classic,1273276800,"05 8, 2010",2010,2885,"['first', 'two', 'paragraphs', 'are', 'taken', 'review', 'Dalton', 'Trumbo', 'novelistic', 'treatment', 'film', 'review', 'points', 'made', 'here', 'apply', 'general', 'film', 'subject', 'war', 'had', 'sorts', 'novelistic', 'treatments', 'most', 'successful', 'usually', 'treading', 'lightly', 'war', 'action', 'delving', 'personal', 'choices', 'consequences', 'characters', 'central', 'aim', 'odd', 'sense', 'most', 'compelling', 'novelistic', 'treatments', 'are', 'pro-war', 'seemingly', 'rational', 'reason', 'defending', 'one', 'country', 'coming', 'aid', 'smaller', 'weaker', 'country', 'etc', 'neutral', 'more', 'physical', 'psychological', 'dimensions', 'situation', 'flat', 'out', 'anti-war', 'use', 'more', 'vague', 'term', 'pacifistic', 'treatment', 'usually', 'not', 'successful', 'either', 'preaching', 'choir', 'quality', 'strikes', 'false', 'chord', 'not', 'case', 'Dalton', 'Trumbo', 'Johnny', 'Got', 'Gun', 'novel', 'was', 'written', 'sign', 'Hitler-Stalin', 'Pact', 'late', '1930s', 'reflected', 'Communist', 'International', 'American', 'Communist', 'Party', 'political', 'line', 'one', 'intense', 'opposition', 'Western', 'war', 'preparations', 'more', 'home', 'truths', 'merely', 'piece', 'communistic', 'propaganda', 'would', 'be', 'incorrect', 'even', 'staunch', 'anti-Stalinists', 'dismiss', 'hand', 'Joe', 'main', 'character', 'here', 'maimed', 'belief', 'repair', 'mother', 'son', 'American', 'mother', 'son', 'interior', 'monologue', 'past', 'lost', 'youth', 'desires', 'useless', 'way', 'was', 'used', 'last', 'days', 'World', 'War', 'almost', 'unique', 'way', 'story', 'unfolds', 'certainly', 'not', 'faint-hearted', 'weak-minded', 'steps', 'are', 'now', 'being', 'taken', 'up', 'ante', 'Afghanistan', 'one', 'wars', 'defend', 'democracy', 'whatever', 'reason', 'day', 'thing', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'reading', 'mother', 'mother', 'son', 'daughter', 'who', 'put', 'war', 'way', 'film', 'pretty', 'faithfully', 'Trumbo', 'least', 'spirit', 'Trumbo', 'main', 'point', 'reading', 'rather', 're-reading', 'novel', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'sustain', 'film', 'based', 'lack', 'action', 'story', 'line', 'dealt', 'two', 'ways-flash', 'backs', 'Joe', 'sunnier', 'times', 'dream', 'sequences', 'featuring', 'likes', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Jesus', 'giving', 'droll', 'interpretation', 'Trumbo', 'message', 'not', 'easy', 'film', 'get', 'certainly', 'not', 'who', 'like', 'entertainments', 'light', 'pathos', 'scenes', 'Joe', 'make', 'sense', 'new', 'world', 'cause', 'reflection', 'said', 'could', 'one', 'find', 'better', 'actor', 'Timothy', 'Bottoms', 'play', 'role', 'Joe', 'fresh-faced', 'dough', 'boy', 'filled', 'illusions', 'filled', 'thoughts', 'invincibility', 'also', 'filled', 'dreams', 'sorrows', 'war', 'Kudos', 'here', 'thanks', 'brother', 'Trumbo']",N/A
498306,A1XKI53W1E891T,B00000F4EU,Amy,"[3, 3]","This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's about a young American soldier named Johnny who gets hit by a shell on the last day of the First World War. Johnny lies in a hospital bed, a quadruple amputee who has lost his eyes, ears, mouth and nose. His only means of communication is by banging his head against his pillow.  As the movie progresses you get inside Johnny's head by means of a series of flashbacks and fantasy sequences. We learn about Johnny's failed shoe salesman father, his first, and last night with the woman he loves, his pre war job in the local bakery. I was so moved by the nurse in the movie. She finds a way to communicate with Johnny and her kindness to him should inspire us all. So, what's this movie all about? Well it's a damning indictment of war, obviously, and a strange one at that. But it's also a metaphysical examination of what it is to be human. The absence of limbs and features in no way extinguishes Johnny's imperishable humanity and in this case the mind definitely rules the body rather than vice versa. Bizarrely, the story is based on real events, and while this kind of truth is usually too strange to be turned into fiction, the director successfully turns Johnny into the living embodiment of the horror of war,but also of the unquenchable resilience of the human spirit. This is a wonderful movie and I highly recommend it if you are someone who likes to watch movies where when you are done watching it the story stays in your mind and has a high impact on you.",5,Very moving and emotional movie,1187136000,"08 15, 2007",2007,1522,"['one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'time', 'young', 'American', 'soldier', 'named', 'Johnny', 'who', 'hit', 'shell', 'last', 'day', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'Johnny', 'hospital', 'bed', 'quadruple', 'amputee', 'who', 'lost', 'eyes', 'ears', 'mouth', 'nose', 'only', 'means', 'communication', 'banging', 'head', 'pillow', 'movie', 'get', 'Johnny', 'head', 'means', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'learn', 'Johnny', 'failed', 'shoe', 'salesman', 'father', 'first', 'last', 'night', 'woman', 'pre', 'war', 'job', 'local', 'bakery', 'was', 'so', 'moved', 'nurse', 'movie', 'way', 'communicate', 'Johnny', 'kindness', 'should', 'inspire', 'So', 'what', 'movie', 'Well', 'damning', 'indictment', 'war', 'obviously', 'strange', 'one', 'also', 'metaphysical', 'examination', 'what', 'be', 'human', 'absence', 'limbs', 'features', 'way', 'Johnny', 'imperishable', 'humanity', 'case', 'mind', 'definitely', 'rules', 'body', 'rather', 'vice', 'versa', 'Bizarrely', 'story', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'kind', 'truth', 'usually', 'too', 'strange', 'be', 'turned', 'fiction', 'director', 'successfully', 'Johnny', 'living', 'embodiment', 'horror', 'war', 'also', 'unquenchable', 'resilience', 'human', 'spirit', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'are', 'someone', 'who', 'watch', 'movies', 'where', 'when', 'are', 'done', 'watching', 'story', 'mind', 'high', 'impact']",N/A

Having a few hours of free time, I decided to watch the film and see if it was really as good as the reviews on Amazon.com would suggest. I was not disappointed.The film is a most powerful inditement of needless wars and a military industrial complex that cares little for the lives of ordinary citizens like Joe. Through following Joe's present situation of having lost nearly his entire body (scenes filmed in black and white) and interspersing these horrific scenes with reminiscences from the past (scenes filmed in color) which over time become less and less reliable, the viewer receives an incredible contrast between the tragedy that is and the possibility that might have been.I have not read Trumbo's novel by the same name, so I cannot say for certain how loyal the film is to Trumbo's intent.However, standing alone, the film is still a powerful motion picture and one that I absolutely recommend, especially for Americans who prefer the neoconservative (Kristol, Cheney) approach to foreign policy ['preemptive wars'] over that of Ron Paul and Alex Jones. Hopefully, the film will at least open up the eyes of people who think 'war is peace' and that the next war will be the 'war to end all wars.'Also, I believe the film does a good job questioning the omnipotence of Jesus Christ (played by Donald Sutherland), who is unable to assist Joe in either finding hope or ending his life.",5,Wonderful Film!!!,1275696000,"06 5, 2010",2010,1439,"['first', 'came', 'film', 'YouTube', 'Having', 'few', 'hours', 'free', 'time', 'decided', 'watch', 'film', 'see', 'was', 'really', 'as', 'good', 'reviews', 'Amazon.com', 'would', 'suggest', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed.The', 'film', 'most', 'powerful', 'inditement', 'needless', 'wars', 'military', 'industrial', 'complex', 'little', 'lives', 'ordinary', 'citizens', 'Joe', 'following', 'Joe', 'present', 'situation', 'having', 'lost', 'nearly', 'entire', 'body', 'scenes', 'filmed', 'black', 'white', 'interspersing', 'horrific', 'scenes', 'reminiscences', 'past', 'scenes', 'filmed', 'color', 'time', 'become', 'less', 'less', 'reliable', 'viewer', 'incredible', 'contrast', 'tragedy', 'possibility', 'might', 'have', 'been.I', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'Trumbo', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'certain', 'how', 'film', 'Trumbo', 'intent.However', 'standing', 'alone', 'film', 'still', 'powerful', 'motion', 'picture', 'one', 'absolutely', 'recommend', 'especially', 'Americans', 'who', 'prefer', 'neoconservative', 'Kristol', 'Cheney', 'approach', 'foreign', 'policy', '[', ""'preemptive"", 'wars', ']', 'Ron', 'Paul', 'Alex', 'Jones', 'Hopefully', 'film', 'will', 'least', 'open', 'up', 'eyes', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'peace', 'next', 'war', 'will', 'be', ""'war"", 'end', 'wars', ""'Also"", 'believe', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'questioning', 'omnipotence', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'played', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'who', 'unable', 'assist', 'Joe', 'finding', 'hope', 'ending', 'life']",N/A

It looks like the tape is running at different speeds.  If this was intentional by the filmakers, I do not know.  This was very distracting to watch.  You can tell everything is 'looped' too(where actors re-record their lines) because their mouths rarely matched what was being heard.  But this is an old movie so I can understand that a little - a lot of 70s movies have that issue(Dirty Harry, Deliverance, etc).  The making-of is not really a making of.  It spends most of the 49 minutes talking about how the director was blacklisted in the 1950's which I didn't care to hear about.  I was more interested in the making of this movie than the directors career.  The Metallica video is flawed.  It looks like someone hit the pause and play button rapidly every 10 seconds, giving it a really weird movement.  It was out of sync.  This is not the way the video is on a Metallica 'The Videos '89-'03' DVD from a few years ago.  The above issues, along with the editing mentioned in other reviews, makes me say you are better off renting it and not buying it like I did.  The jerky movements are distracting.

498315,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B00000F4EU,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[93, 99]","This is a significant film that has reached cult status. Dalton Trumbo wrote the novel in 1938, won the National Book Award, and then the book was banned as subversive. Trumbo suffered a polemic from HUAC in 1949, and spent a year in jail for contempt of congress. The book was banned again in 1950, during the Korean War. Kirk Douglas brought him out of exile in 1960 to write the screenplay for SPARTACUS. In 1970, Trumbo directed this film himself, adapted from his own book, and it emerged as a scathing anti-war allegory. When the film opened, it did poorly at the box office in America. The Viet Nam war had clouded the issue. Perhaps if he had included more humor and satire in the picture it would have been easier to digest. Watching it is like drinking white lightning; it burns all the way down.In 1989, the rock group Metallica released a 7 minute video called TWO OF ONE, and it did use clips from this film. This helped to generate more interest in the movie. The cinematography was above average, done by Jules Brenner, nicely blending B&W;, sepia, and full color scenes.We are introduced in the opening scene to a group of doctors discussing a decerebrated patient, a grievously wounded soldier, assumed to be brain dead; incapable of sentience or dreams; just an armless, legless, faceless, totally deaf living chunk of meat with a beating heart and an active colon. But we soon hear the soldier's voice, and realize he is aware of his environment.Timothy Bottoms, in his film debut, played the young soldier, Joe Bonham. He did an exceptional job with the voice over work, and we get to see him in the flesh in flashbacks; even the moment he crouched in the trenches, readying himself for his rendezvous with the howitzer shell that had his name on it. There were some rough spots in his acting, but overall he was fine as the fresh-faced naive Joe. Jason Robards played the father, and he underplayed brilliantly. He was a terrific actor, who could bray and strut like in A THOUSAND CLOWNS, or he could quietly inhabit a role like he did in this film. Kathy Fields did a credible job as Joe's sweetheart, Kareen. Charles McGraw was wonderfully gruff, yet compassionate at Kareen's Dad. Eduard Franz, a skilled character actor, played the pivotal role of General Tillery, the doctor that had spared Joe's life, such as it was. Donald Sutherland played Christ, looking every inch both the hippy and the savoir. His scenes gave us a humorous take on death and war. Trumbo should have paid more attention to this level of satire. It might have made this movie more popular to the audiences of 1971.Diane Varsi was outstanding as the fourth Nurse. She found a way to share her love of humanity with what was left of Joe. Her willingness to see him as a human being, to open windows, to sponge bathe him, even masturbate him, showed a level of compassion unrivaled in the piece. It was she that figured out Joe's incessant head movements were important. They turned out to be Morse code. Joe found a way to commlunicate with his doctors.He asked to be allowed to be around other people, even to be given over to a carnival if necessary. He was tired of being alone. If they would not do this, then they should kill him. It was a chilling scene indeed, when shame, guilt, and cowardice washed over the medical assemblage. They fled quickly, exiling Nurse Varsi from the room, turned their backs on him, leaving him alone and drugged in the darkness and the complete silence, in the hellish limbo of the land of the living dead.I liked this film a lot, more for its message than its content. As TV Guide put it, the movie was,&quot;flawed but powerful.&quot; This film has sturdy teeth, and it bites through much of the traditional dogma, propaganda, and lies that politicians force-feed us eternally. It teaches us that blind patriotism can lead us into dark events, whereby the powers that be will be able to manipulate or sacrifice our life or limb on the alter of their choosing. It teaches us further that freedom, liberty, and democracy can be reduced to buzz words that can mantle the real issues.

498321,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,B00000F4EU,James Morris,"[41, 41]","In 1971 I was 17, and a budding ""hippie"" with anti-war leanings and a rebel streak a mile long.  While riding the NYC subway to work one day, I noticed a young man about my age absorbed in a book as he rode next to me.  The title of the book was Johnny Got His Gun.  ""Probably some right-wing adolescent shoot-`em-up war epic"", I thought to myself, dismissing the teen and his book from my mind.  A few weeks later, I read an article in the newspaper that a film was being made of the book Johnny Got His Gun, and I was instantly embarrassed at my previous assumption of the book's subject matter when I read that Johnny Got His Gun was actually a pacifist anti-war classic, and that its author, Dalton Trumbo, had been blacklisted as a communist during the 1950's.  A few days later, I ran across the book in my favorite bookstore, and picked it up almost without thinking.I was immediately blown away by the intense imagery of the narrative's storyline.  Joe Bonham, an 18-year old soldier, is hit by a bombshell on the last day of WWI, and awakes in a hospital bed horribly deformed.  Unable to speak, see, hear, or smell, he gradually learns that his arms and legs have been amputated.  As the horror of his situation unfolds in a stream-of-consciousness first person narrative, he slowly realizes that the bomb shell that hit him scooped out his face, leaving a gaping hole where his eyes, ears, nose and mouth used to be.  The army doctors automatically assume he is a thoughtless vegetable, and in an experimental effort to see if they can keep someone in his condition alive, he spends the next several years in a hospital bed, well cared-for but practically forgotten.  Joe is constantly thinking but unable to communicate.  Deprived of all senses, except feelings and thoughts, his story movingly unfolds, and I was forever transformed by the beauty of Mr. Trumbo's story-telling ability and the terror-filled description of Joe's situation.  He spends his days remembering the details of his young life, while struggling to overcome the inability to discern his conscious thoughts from his nightmares.  As I waited for the film's premiere, I must have read and re-read the book a half dozen times, and 38 years later, portions of the powerful book still stick with me.I saw the film on opening day in an art house on the east side of Manhattan, and although I was slightly disappointed by the movie's inability to project the author's hauntingly beautiful prose onto the screen, the story has remained a favorite of mine ever since.  I recall that the film got lukewarm reviews, but I remember urging all of my friends to see it and experience it for themselves.  I also remember a review by Rex Reed, then one of the top film critics in NY.  In describing the scene where Joe finally manages to communicate with a nurse the fact that he has conscious thoughts, Mr. Reed said that that scene alone contained more tenderness than the entire film ""Love Story"" (which was then a current smash hit).  I was also bitterly disappointed that the film did not get more attention.Recently I learned that an all-region DVD of the film was available from Portugal, and I gladly paid Amazon the import price of the DVD.  I also obtained a new copy of the book, and found to my delight that the story had lost none of its impact after 38 years.  Why should it?  The book was first published in 1939, and when I first discovered it 32 years later, I found it fresh, vibrant and surprisingly topical.Apparently due the fact that a stage version (and a DVD of the stage version) is getting quite a bit of attention, the powers that be have finally decided to release this forgotten gem.  I will now order the new DVD as well.Although the film is slightly dated, I heartily recommend it for its unforgettable storyline.  I also recommend that anyone who enjoys it check out the novel; Mr. Trumbo's masterpiece is every bit as compelling as any film version could ever be.",5,Never Judge A Book By Its Cover,1234137600,"02 9, 2009",2009,3965,"['1971', 'was', '17', 'budding', 'hippie', 'anti-war', 'leanings', 'rebel', 'streak', 'mile', 'long', 'riding', 'NYC', 'subway', 'work', 'one', 'day', 'noticed', 'young', 'man', 'age', 'absorbed', 'book', 'rode', 'next', 'title', 'book', 'was', 'Johnny', 'Got', 'Gun', 'Probably', 'right-wing', 'adolescent', 'shoot-', 'em-up', 'war', 'epic', 'thought', 'myself', 'dismissing', 'teen', 'book', 'mind', 'few', 'weeks', 'later', 'read', 'article', 'newspaper', 'film', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'book', 'Johnny', 'Got', 'Gun', 'was', 'instantly', 'embarrassed', 'previous', 'assumption', 'book', 'subject', 'matter', 'when', 'read', 'Johnny', 'Got', 'Gun', 'was', 'actually', 'pacifist', 'anti-war', 'classic', 'author', 'Dalton', 'Trumbo', 'had', 'been', 'blacklisted', 'communist', '1950', 'A', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'ran', 'book', 'favorite', 'bookstore', 'picked', 'up', 'almost', 'thinking.I', 'was', 'immediately', 'blown', 'away', 'intense', 'imagery', 'narrative', 'storyline', 'Joe', 'Bonham', '18-year', 'old', 'soldier', 'hit', 'bombshell', 'last', 'day', 'WWI', 'awakes', 'hospital', 'bed', 'horribly', 'deformed', 'Unable', 'speak', 'see', 'hear', 'smell', 'gradually', 'arms', 'legs', 'have', 'been', 'amputated', 'horror', 'situation', 'stream-of-consciousness', 'first', 'person', 'narrative', 'slowly', 'bomb', 'shell', 'hit', 'scooped', 'out', 'face', 'leaving', 'gaping', 'hole', 'where', 'eyes', 'ears', 'nose', 'mouth', 'used', 'be', 'army', 'doctors', 'automatically', 'assume', 'thoughtless', 'vegetable', 'experimental', 'effort', 'see', 'can', 'keep', 'someone', 'condition', 'alive', 'next', 'several', 'years', 'hospital', 'bed', 'well', 'cared-for', 'practically', 'forgotten', 'Joe', 'constantly', 'thinking', 'unable', 'communicate', 'Deprived', 'senses', 'feelings', 'thoughts', 'story', 'movingly', 'unfolds', 'was', 'forever', 'transformed', 'beauty', 'Mr.', 'Trumbo', 'story-telling', 'ability', 'terror-filled', 'description', 'Joe', 'situation', 'days', 'remembering', 'details', 'young', 'life', 'struggling', 'overcome', 'inability', 'discern', 'conscious', 'thoughts', 'nightmares', 'waited', 'film', 'premiere', 'must', 'have', 'read', 're-read', 'book', 'half', 'dozen', 'times', '38', 'years', 'later', 'portions', 'powerful', 'book', 'still', 'stick', 'me.I', 'saw', 'film', 'opening', 'day', 'art', 'house', 'east', 'side', 'Manhattan', 'was', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'inability', 'project', 'author', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'prose', 'screen', 'story', 'remained', 'favorite', 'mine', 'ever', 'recall', 'film', 'got', 'lukewarm', 'reviews', 'remember', 'urging', 'friends', 'see', 'experience', 'also', 'remember', 'review', 'Rex', 'Reed', 'then', 'one', 'top', 'film', 'critics', 'NY', 'describing', 'scene', 'where', 'Joe', 'finally', 'communicate', 'nurse', 'fact', 'conscious', 'thoughts', 'Mr.', 'Reed', 'said', 'scene', 'alone', 'contained', 'more', 'tenderness', 'entire', 'film', 'Love', 'Story', 'was', 'then', 'current', 'smash', 'hit', 'was', 'also', 'bitterly', 'disappointed', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'more', 'attention.Recently', 'learned', 'all-region', 'DVD', 'film', 'was', 'available', 'Portugal', 'gladly', 'paid', 'Amazon', 'import', 'price', 'DVD', 'also', 'obtained', 'new', 'copy', 'book', 'found', 'delight', 'story', 'had', 'lost', 'none', 'impact', '38', 'years', 'Why', 'should', 'book', 'was', 'first', 'published', '1939', 'when', 'first', 'discovered', '32', 'years', 'later', 'found', 'fresh', 'vibrant', 'surprisingly', 'topical.Apparently', 'due', 'fact', 'stage', 'version', 'DVD', 'stage', 'version', 'getting', 'quite', 'bit', 'attention', 'powers', 'be', 'have', 'finally', 'decided', 'release', 'forgotten', 'gem', 'will', 'now', 'order', 'new', 'DVD', 'film', 'slightly', 'dated', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'unforgettable', 'storyline', 'also', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'check', 'out', 'novel', 'Mr.', 'Trumbo', 'masterpiece', 'bit', 'as', 'compelling', 'film', 'version', 'could', 'ever', 'be']",N/A

498327,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B00000F4EU,J from NY,"[15, 15]","When I was young, the heavy metal group Metallica released a video entitled &quot;One&quot;.  A child at the time, I remember seeing black and white images of a man who appeared to be wearing a nurse's mask, and hearing narration.  Later on, seeing the video a few times, I realized what it was about, who this man was, and the general plotline.  I was so simultaneously horrified, depressed, and abysmally aware that this COULD happen and probably had happen that I thought about it for days.  I even feared, for a time, turning on MTV for fear of seeing the video again.  It stuck in my mind like morbid superglue.Finding out more about &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot; as novel, I was almost terrified to touch the book, but soon couldn't resist anymore.  The impact of the novel on my mind was indescribable.  Although I had no intention whatsoever of seeing the film (the book, in it's depth, sincerity, hopelessness and painstaking attention to gruesome detail had overwhelmed me), I promised myself that one day I would.I did.  While it doesn't approach the power of the novel, it is a film like no other.  I have never once seen a plot this bleak and &quot;in your face&quot; in terms of anti war, matters of human dignity and just bare suffering ever.  It made my stomach turn, heart leap and etched in my memory.  The scenes where Joe talks to an obviously illusory Christ are surreal and disturbing.  This is bar none the most powerful anti-war film, and one (if not the) powerful films I have ever seen.  I am not surprised at it's obscurity, as few would even want to see it.

A battered Bantam edition with a cover painting vaguely screaming, then intensely burning into my eyes when I realized in that dark store what I was seeing--a used book store--a dark cold November late afternoon-the first war novel I bought, because of that front cover of hell and the resounding review blurbs from all over the world on the back and inside. I read it Friday night. I was in UT. I have never been more shaken in my life. I had nightmares that night that Joe was on my attic steps trying to weep and having no eyes or face. The putting away when discovered, the shame of it, and far too often the truth is hidden, until it is too late.When the movie came out, I saw it in Memphis one hot Saturday afternoon. I was astounded that an ""unfilmable"" novel was filmed. As has been said, the beauty, the passion, the sheer incredible urgency of Dalton Trumbo's words could not be conveyed, yet it is unforgettable. I wrote endlessly about both for my university newspaper. I wanted to scream on housetops, read this book, see this film.Timothy Bottoms was superb as Joe. His dreams, his nightmares, his dad, his mom, his girl, even Christ mingle and slip away and try to help or say stay far from me, and his gradual knowing piece by piece what has happened to him. ""Oh Joe, put your two strong arms around me. Oh Joe, don't go.  You won't come back."" To the angry roar of the crowds and of the train ready for hell and the pompous patriotic speeches screamed in the background, all of it a series of horrors, a bid for love, a nurse's kindness, and the utter tragedy, for this is the face of war, Joe says to himself, everyone must see me, SOS SOS SOSIt is the most powerful book I have ever read and re-read, and one of the most powerful movies. Part of the genius of them is focusing on one soldier, few battle scenes, taking us into the mind of  a man as dead as dead can be and who horribly is aware and thinks. The sheer rapture of Joe's becoming able to count the days, to know it is Christmas morning, to dream he is whole and young and free as he falls into glorious summer grass on a blue sky day.One of the greats. A book and a movie needed right this second. Somehow Dalton Trumbo wrote from inside the mind of a man so destroyed. Somehow he made it into a movie. I wish to climb again to the house tops and scream see this movie, read this book. It is so heartening to read the reviews--and how such power and such love of life Dalton Trumbo created is remembered and still loved. That's the thing of it. Joe on my attic steps, trying to cry, but having no face or eyes.

498332,A2DB720I9XRX7K,B00000F4EU,K. Draper,"[0, 0]","this 1971 movie, based on the famous 1939 anti-war novel of the same name by Dalton Trumbo makes a powerful and obvious statement about the horrors of war, but I also think that it makes an impassioned statement about the need to treat people with disabilities, no matter how profound, with dignity and humanity.As the film opens, a team of doctors stares down at the breathing but otherwise completely incapacitated victim of enemy shelling. The unidentifiable soldier, we learn as he does, has lost both of his legs and arms, as well as most of his face. More importantly, the medical diagnosis is that he has lost nearly all of his brain function, except for the autonomic brain stem function which keeps him alive. The doctor in charge calls him ""decerebrated"" (lacking in higher brain functions) and orders that he be kept alive and cared for so that they can see what they can learn from him.  He further commands that the staff involved in the care of the patient not become emotionally involved with him, as he cannot think or feel anything at all. The young GI, it turns out has a very active mind, and throughout the two hours of the film experiences thoughts, flashbacks, dreams and desires, although he is unable to hear or see or communicate.Once he was whole and active as any other young American male. He was Joe Bonham, caught up with the desire to ""make the world safe for democracy"" and do his part in by serving his country to fight in The Great War. He seemed to have a romanticized view of the war, and he had no second thoughts about leaving his family behind, even though his father was dead. He had no problem leaving his girlfriend, Kareen, behind either, even though she repeatedly begged him not to go. She was sure he will be killed, but this did not bother him. What he never considered is that a fate perhaps worse than death itself could await him.In between the flashbacks and vignettes, we see the patient lying on a hospital bed mostly covered. He has a blanket or sheet over what is left of his body. His face, except for his forehead is covered by a mask. His curly hair and his neck with a breathing tube are visible. He struggles with trying to find out what happened to him, where he is, how much time passes, and how to communicate. I find it interesting the doctors insisted that the patient be sequestered away from everyone else to such an extreme that he ends up in a storage room with even the windows shuttered and the door locked. If he moves around too much they give him a sedative. Basically he is just considered to be a lump of flesh.(sorry for some spoilers). Eventually a nurse opens the window and he can feel the sunlight on his face. Eventually another nurse feels compassion for him and touches him lovingly. He exults as he learns to interpret the letters which she draws on his chest, spelling out ""Merry Christmas"". He finally thinks of a way to communicate by tapping his head in Morse Code. Medical staff, including the original doctor are brought to his room to witness this communication. Now that they know that he is a thinking, feeling man, does this bring him more humane treatment and end his isolation? Will he find a reason to want to continue to live?  These questions and their answers are what make the ending of this film interesting, and I think have insight for our treatment of the severely disabled in general.",5,Anti-war movie also a statement about the humanity of the disabled,1298160000,"02 20, 2011",2011,3391,"['1971', 'movie', 'based', 'famous', '1939', 'anti-war', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Dalton', 'Trumbo', 'powerful', 'obvious', 'statement', 'horrors', 'war', 'also', 'think', 'impassioned', 'statement', 'need', 'treat', 'people', 'disabilities', 'matter', 'how', 'profound', 'dignity', 'humanity.As', 'film', 'team', 'doctors', 'stares', 'down', 'breathing', 'otherwise', 'completely', 'incapacitated', 'victim', 'enemy', 'shelling', 'unidentifiable', 'soldier', 'learn', 'lost', 'legs', 'arms', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'face', 'More', 'importantly', 'medical', 'diagnosis', 'lost', 'nearly', 'brain', 'function', 'autonomic', 'brain', 'stem', 'function', 'alive', 'doctor', 'charge', 'decerebrated', 'lacking', 'higher', 'brain', 'functions', 'orders', 'be', 'kept', 'alive', 'cared', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'can', 'learn', 'further', 'staff', 'involved', 'care', 'patient', 'not', 'become', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'feel', 'anything', 'young', 'GI', 'out', 'very', 'active', 'mind', 'two', 'hours', 'film', 'experiences', 'thoughts', 'flashbacks', 'dreams', 'desires', 'unable', 'hear', 'see', 'communicate.Once', 'was', 'whole', 'active', 'other', 'young', 'American', 'male', 'was', 'Joe', 'Bonham', 'caught', 'up', 'desire', 'make', 'world', 'safe', 'democracy', 'do', 'part', 'serving', 'country', 'fight', 'Great', 'War', 'seemed', 'have', 'romanticized', 'view', 'war', 'had', 'second', 'thoughts', 'leaving', 'family', 'even', 'father', 'was', 'dead', 'had', 'problem', 'leaving', 'girlfriend', 'Kareen', 'even', 'repeatedly', 'begged', 'not', 'go', 'was', 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'killed', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'What', 'never', 'considered', 'fate', 'perhaps', 'worse', 'death', 'could', 'await', 'him.In', 'flashbacks', 'vignettes', 'see', 'patient', 'lying', 'hospital', 'bed', 'mostly', 'covered', 'blanket', 'sheet', 'what', 'left', 'body', 'face', 'forehead', 'covered', 'mask', 'curly', 'hair', 'neck', 'breathing', 'tube', 'are', 'visible', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'where', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'passes', 'how', 'communicate', 'find', 'interesting', 'doctors', 'insisted', 'patient', 'be', 'sequestered', 'away', 'everyone', 'else', 'extreme', 'up', 'storage', 'room', 'even', 'windows', 'shuttered', 'door', 'locked', 'around', 'too', 'much', 'give', 'sedative', 'Basically', 'just', 'considered', 'be', 'lump', 'flesh', 'sorry', 'spoilers', 'Eventually', 'nurse', 'window', 'can', 'feel', 'sunlight', 'face', 'Eventually', 'nurse', 'compassion', 'touches', 'lovingly', 'exults', 'interpret', 'letters', 'chest', 'spelling', 'out', 'Merry', 'Christmas', 'finally', 'way', 'communicate', 'tapping', 'head', 'Morse', 'Code', 'Medical', 'staff', 'including', 'original', 'doctor', 'are', 'brought', 'room', 'witness', 'communication', 'Now', 'know', 'thinking', 'feeling', 'man', 'bring', 'more', 'humane', 'treatment', 'end', 'isolation', 'Will', 'find', 'reason', 'want', 'continue', 'live', 'questions', 'answers', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'ending', 'film', 'interesting', 'think', 'have', 'insight', 'treatment', 'severely', 'disabled', 'general']",N/A

Unfortunately, given today's Political Climate that's doubtful.  There is a brief scene in the band's Long Version of the Music Video where the protaganist, as a young boy, asks his Father, ""What is Democracy?""  This is pre-WWI.  The Father, John Huston, I think, mumbles something like, ""It's got something to do with young men killing each other, I think.""  I made sure my kids watched that video, back inna day...The cover is, for me, thought provoking in a way.  That Peace sign, the split fingers.  That sign has it's roots in the 15th century, you know, The 100 Years War.  At the Battle of Agincourt, the French cut the middle fingers off of Welsh Archers that they had captured.  After that, the Longbowmen would show that they still had their fingers by flashing, what later became, the Peace sign.A few years ago, my now grown son joined the Army, right out of College.

The political agenda and philosophical premise may fall apart upon close examination, but the very human story of a young American soldier in WW I who loses all his limbs and four of his senses is as unforgettable as his novel.  There's no blood and gore here.  It's the bandaged stump of a man's memories, feelings and especially sense of touch that burn in his soul.  Timothy Bottoms is terrific as hallucinating war victim Joe Bonham and Donald Sutherland makes an interesting appearance as Jesus.  With the limited technology available to merge dreams, memories and reality, this film suffers here and there.  But the empathetic story of one human suffering for a nebulous cause is searing in its timeless depiction of the price paid by old men in suits who see youth as gun fodder for their dubious political or capitalist agendas.

However, even though the main character loses his arms, legs, face and four of his five senses to a mortar in World War I, not a drop of blood is shown in the movie and the film's indictment of the institution of war seems to take a backseat to the young soldier's struggle to adapt to his dark, silent and motionless environment.I was hesitant to watch this film at first because I thought it would be dull to watch a two-hour movie concerning a horribly maimed young man lying in bed. However, due to his unique condition of being connected to this world only through his sense of touch, I found it fascinating how he first struggles to distinguish his dreams from his reality, and after that tries puts his energy toward discerning the passage of time.The movie includes a number of dream sequences, which to a man deprived of sight, sound, smell and taste, must certainly at least rival anything that happens during his waking hours in importance. The numerous dream sequences serve to explain his past and shed light on his values. Some of them are quite surreal, some are unhappy while some are fairly humorous.The ending is grim and the man's predicament is left unresolved, which leaves the viewer to fill in some of the blanks, but this invites the viewer to give the movie some thought after seeing it, and I by no means felt that the movie was left so open-ended that I felt like I had been shortchanged.I strongly recommend this brilliant film even to those people who generally avoid war movies.",5,Dark Masterpiece,1023926400,"06 13, 2002",2002,1677,"['have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'knew', 'basic', 'plot', 'outline', 'so', 'when', 'saw', 'film', 'expected', 'very', 'strong', 'anti-war', 'sentiments', 'be', 'pervasive', 'movie', 'However', 'even', 'main', 'character', 'arms', 'legs', 'face', 'four', 'five', 'senses', 'mortar', 'World', 'War', 'not', 'drop', 'blood', 'shown', 'movie', 'film', 'indictment', 'institution', 'war', 'take', 'backseat', 'young', 'soldier', 'struggle', 'adapt', 'dark', 'silent', 'motionless', 'environment.I', 'was', 'hesitant', 'watch', 'film', 'first', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'dull', 'watch', 'two-hour', 'movie', 'concerning', 'horribly', 'maimed', 'young', 'man', 'lying', 'bed', 'However', 'due', 'unique', 'condition', 'being', 'connected', 'world', 'only', 'sense', 'touch', 'found', 'fascinating', 'how', 'first', 'distinguish', 'dreams', 'reality', 'energy', 'discerning', 'passage', 'time.The', 'movie', 'number', 'dream', 'sequences', 'man', 'deprived', 'sight', 'sound', 'smell', 'taste', 'must', 'certainly', 'least', 'rival', 'anything', 'waking', 'hours', 'importance', 'numerous', 'dream', 'sequences', 'serve', 'explain', 'past', 'shed', 'light', 'values', 'are', 'quite', 'surreal', 'are', 'unhappy', 'are', 'fairly', 'humorous.The', 'ending', 'grim', 'man', 'predicament', 'left', 'unresolved', 'viewer', 'fill', 'blanks', 'viewer', 'give', 'movie', 'thought', 'seeing', 'means', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'left', 'so', 'open-ended', 'felt', 'had', 'been', 'shortchanged.I', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'brilliant', 'film', 'even', 'people', 'who', 'generally', 'avoid', 'war', 'movies']",N/A

A courageous and compassionate nurse understands Johnny and mercifully disconnects his breathing tube so he can die swiftly and be released from his body which has become a prison.
