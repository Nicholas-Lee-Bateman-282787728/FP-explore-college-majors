The only horror involved here is that this movie was even made. The acting was the worst I have seen in recent memory,the special effects look like someone ravaged a butcher shop dumpster,and there is no plot at all. A completely worthless hack film.

A doctor that uses Faberware scissors to open up patients, and uses a pump for a blood transfusion?! They didn't even get the color of frog's blood right! I'll admit to something. This movie is better than other zombie movies (Zombie Nationcomes to mind). For a low budget zombie movie, it was ok. If you watch this movie, which I hope you don't, you will somewhat enjoy the movie once the zombies overrun the hospital. I guess the biggest fault of this movie, aside from the pathetic acting, is the beginning of the film and the lack of good props. The zombies are not that bad, except when they talk, and then it all goes down the drain. Zombies should not talk, they should eat and that's it. But, in this film the doctor's wife has quite the long dialogue, and that is annoying.",2,D-rated zombie movie,1194393600,"11 7, 2007",2007,884,"['so', 'bad', 'even', 'have', 'not', 'finished', 'watching', 'am', 'already', 'writing', 'review', 'doctor', 'Faberware', 'scissors', 'open', 'up', 'patients', 'pump', 'blood', 'transfusion', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'color', 'frog', 'blood', 'right', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'something', 'movie', 'better', 'other', 'zombie', 'movies', 'Zombie', 'Nationcomes', 'mind', 'low', 'budget', 'zombie', 'movie', 'was', 'ok', 'watch', 'movie', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'will', 'somewhat', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'zombies', 'overrun', 'hospital', 'guess', 'biggest', 'fault', 'movie', 'aside', 'pathetic', 'acting', 'beginning', 'film', 'lack', 'good', 'props', 'zombies', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'when', 'talk', 'then', 'down', 'drain', 'Zombies', 'should', 'not', 'talk', 'should', 'eat', 'film', 'doctor', 'wife', 'quite', 'long', 'dialogue', 'annoying']",Night of the Dead

First the title then the whole plot of the movie is like Re-animator but a bad knock of the greatness of Re-Animator. It starts with a doctor bringing a dead frog back to life then it goes crazy so he kills it. This is how it starts really dumb not even funny. ThenHis wife and daughter dies and you know the rest of the story. This movie was painful to watch. Bad acting,bad script, and terrible effects. This movie offers nothing on all levels. I rented this trash and feel so rip off. Do youerself a favor and PASS on this terd bomb!!
