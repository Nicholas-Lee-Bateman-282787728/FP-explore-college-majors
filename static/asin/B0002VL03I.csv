She is a good actress and is totally gorgeous as a NYC ""modern woman"" with a promiscuity problem, she's a ""user"" and hangs out with other ""users"", she becomes despondent. Through the provedential intervention of a wise shrink, one wonders if she will overcome it and find true happiness as a simple doctor's wife -- or revert to life as a well-paid, hi-fashion magazine editor. She is also involved in a murder investigation and suspicions turn her way.  Watch for Margaret Hamilton.  The Story is a ""5"" Picture quality is about a ""4"" its not perfect but completely watchable and enjoyable, the night scenes are a little dark, but all others have good contrast with no noticable artifacts or blotches.  The sound is very good, its even & steady and when you turn the volume up it does'nt hiss. The VCI Double Feature disc is a real bargain just for this movie alone, BUT look you also have---STRANGE WOMAN: This stars Hedy Lamarr as well as George Sanders, Louis Hayward, Gene Lockhart, Hillary Brooke, Rhys Williams, June Story, Moroni Olsen, Olive Blakeney, Kathleen Lockhart, Alan Napier, Dennis Hoey. The plot begins in Bangor Main in 1824 with Jennie Hagar as a child of about 8 at a swimming hole with some other childern all speaking with California accents.  Then the next scene is of Jennie played by Hedy with a foreign accent, noticably missing in the whole town is Main accents, but then this is the charm of old movies.  Hedy plays a manipulative temptress who marries a much older man out of need.  She plays a range of emotions in this drama. Its an enjoyable film for any Hedy Lamarr fan. The DVD quality on this film is quite good about the same as the previous film, it does a little better in the dark scenes. And the sound is clear and steady with no hiss when the volume is turned way up.This disc has scene selections and an extra.EXTRA FEATURE: ""Made In America"" a newsreel style advertisement/documentary about Hollywood and all the movies ""in the can"" and soon to be released, showing some behind the scene looks inorder to stir up interest in future releases.Hope this helps......",5,Just a Note On DVD Quality,1102032000,"12 3, 2004",2004,2326,"['Acme', 'Double', 'Feature', 'division', 'VCI/fi', ""'ve"", 'always', 'had', 'good', 'luck', 'VCI', 'releases', 'so', 'took', 'chance.DISHONORED', 'LADY', 'wonderful', 'film', 'Hedy', 'range', 'emotions', 'including', 'tipsy', 'good', 'actress', 'totally', 'gorgeous', 'NYC', 'modern', 'woman', 'promiscuity', 'problem', 'user', 'out', 'other', 'users', 'despondent', 'provedential', 'intervention', 'wise', 'shrink', 'one', 'wonders', 'will', 'overcome', 'find', 'true', 'happiness', 'simple', 'doctor', 'wife', 'revert', 'life', 'well-paid', 'hi-fashion', 'magazine', 'editor', 'also', 'involved', 'murder', 'investigation', 'suspicions', 'turn', 'way', 'Watch', 'Margaret', 'Hamilton', 'Story', '5', 'Picture', 'quality', '4', 'not', 'perfect', 'completely', 'watchable', 'enjoyable', 'night', 'scenes', 'are', 'little', 'dark', 'others', 'have', 'good', 'contrast', 'noticable', 'artifacts', 'blotches', 'sound', 'very', 'good', 'even', 'steady', 'when', 'turn', 'volume', 'hiss', 'VCI', 'Double', 'Feature', 'disc', 'real', 'bargain', 'just', 'movie', 'alone', 'BUT', 'look', 'also', 'have', '-STRANGE', 'WOMAN', 'Hedy', 'Lamarr', 'as', 'well', 'George', 'Sanders', 'Louis', 'Hayward', 'Gene', 'Lockhart', 'Hillary', 'Brooke', 'Rhys', 'Williams', 'June', 'Story', 'Moroni', 'Olsen', 'Olive', 'Blakeney', 'Kathleen', 'Lockhart', 'Alan', 'Napier', 'Dennis', 'Hoey', 'plot', 'Bangor', 'Main', '1824', 'Jennie', 'Hagar', 'child', 'about', '8', 'swimming', 'hole', 'other', 'childern', 'speaking', 'California', 'accents', 'Then', 'next', 'scene', 'Jennie', 'played', 'Hedy', 'foreign', 'accent', 'noticably', 'missing', 'whole', 'town', 'Main', 'accents', 'then', 'charm', 'old', 'movies', 'Hedy', 'manipulative', 'temptress', 'who', 'much', 'older', 'man', 'need', 'range', 'emotions', 'drama', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'Hedy', 'Lamarr', 'fan', 'DVD', 'quality', 'film', 'quite', 'good', 'same', 'previous', 'film', 'little', 'better', 'dark', 'scenes', 'sound', 'clear', 'steady', 'hiss', 'when', 'volume', 'turned', 'way', 'up.This', 'disc', 'scene', 'selections', 'extra.EXTRA', 'FEATURE', 'Made', 'America', 'newsreel', 'style', 'advertisement/documentary', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'can', 'soon', 'be', 'released', 'showing', 'scene', 'inorder', 'stir', 'up', 'interest', 'future', 'releases.Hope']",N/A
847348,A3GPR7GJ6HGVEY,B0002VL03I,"Burt Lee Liberty ""Artsy Leftist""","[0, 5]","Here is a film ripoff of a play, according to what I read.I also read that this was a vehicle for the lead, though it seems funny to me that a woman would go out of her way to play a dishonored woman as a showcase for herself. I went in blind, and it seems early that it's fairly exploitative and by the end it becomes more of a legitimate film. I wish it had chosen one route.We follow a dark protagonist, a beautiful woman working for a magazine, a whore and thrill seeker who apparently takes after her poppa, who was apparently a pink plunderer with an artistic flair. That's mentioned, but again the movie feels split in two between the skank-at-large and the story of the redeemed lady.The dishonored lady meets the man of her dreams, a geeky scientist. It's not totally convincing when he falls snap out of infatuation for her when confronted with her other side. Plot is too much at the forefront. The acting is fairly good. In some instances the film chooses to ""tell rather than show"" with a virtuous psychiatrist character. The film seems to me to milk Casablanca and Citizen Kane imagery, but maybe I'm crazy.It brings some sadness to me when reminded of the fact that at one point it was actually a bad thing to be a whore.

THE STRANGE WOMAN was one of the films made during this time. This sudsy period melodrama stars Lamarr as Jenny Hager, a young woman whose wanton lusts and desires end up destroying three men - and eventually herself.In 1800s Maine, Jenny emerges from her white-trash origins to become the wife of wealthy Isaiah Poster (Gene Lockhart), though the marriage is completely devoid of love and affection from Jenny's corner. She soon turns her attentions to her stepson Ephraim (Louis Hayward) and convinces him to kill his father, so that they may be together. But once the dirty deed has been done, Jenny turns her back on Ephraim and begins to zero-in on John Evered (George Sanders), the handsome new foreman. The fact that he is engaged to her supposed best friend (Hillary Brooke) doesn't faze Jenny in the least. It seems nothing will stop ruthless Jenny in her horrifying quest for love.Hedy Lamarr is ideally-suited in bringing to life the monstrous yet captivating Jenny Hager.

She is prepared to let him drown, asking &#34;who cares?&#34; until Judge Saladine happens by, at which point she takes credit for saving the boy's life.Jenny grows up to be a beautiful but equally heartless and manipulative young woman. Her father, a drunken widower, whips Jenny after learning of her flirtation with a sailor. She secretly schemes to wed the richest man in town, the much older timber baron Isaiah Poster, while his son Ephraim is away to college at Cambridge.Poster is unkind to his mild-mannered son upon Ephraim's return. He is unaware that the boy and Jenny were once sweethearts and that Jenny is again flirting with Ephraim behind her husband's back. Poster is more concerned about the lawlessness in town, lumberjacks drunkenly pillaging the town, manhandling the women and killing the judge, confirming Poster's long-held belief that Bangor must organize a police force.Jenny secretly hopes that her husband will die after he falls ill. When he recovers, Poster must make a trip to his lumber camps. Jenny appeals to Ephraim to arrange his father's death, saying, &#34;I want you to return alone.&#34; In the rapids, both men fall from an overturned canoe and Poster drowns. His son, still deathly afraid of water, is unable or unwilling to save him.To his shock, Ephraim returns to Jenny telling him, &#34;You wretched coward. You killed my father.&#34; He becomes a hopeless drunk, hating her and speaking freely about her deceitful ways. Poster's superintendent in the timber business, John Evered, goes to confront Ephraim but isn't sure whether to believe the harsh words he hears about Jenny.Jenny proceeds to seduce Evered, who is engaged to marry her best friend, Meg Saladine, the judge's daughter. Lust overtakes them during a thunderstorm. After their wedding, Poster is eager to have children, but Jenny learns she cannot bear any.A traveling evangelist, Lincoln Pettridge, preaches fire and brimstone that results in Jenny's confession to her husband that everything Ephraim said about her was true. Evered goes off to be by himself at a lumber camp, where Meg comes to persuade Evered to go back to his wife. Jenny, however, discovers them together, violently whips her horse and tries to run them down with her carriage. It careens off a cliff and she is killed.

847356,A2D9TA1EYXA9KR,B0002VL03I,"J. Kara Russell ""Actress/Artist/Musician/Writer""","[10, 11]","What a perfect pairing of films.  After her production role of the fascinating and morally complex STRANGE WOMAN (see my separate 5 star review for that), Hedy was awarded this great murder mystery, based on a true story, DISHONORED LADY.I saw this on a very poor VHS transfer (not purchased through Amazon).  The script is wonderful - a bit melodramatic, the casting is great, but the post production aspects, especially the music are a real disappointment because Hedy shines in this film with HER FINEST ACTING WORK ON FILM.  In another role that is complex and real in its portrayal of a ""party girl"" trying to straighten out her life, her self, when she becomes a murder suspect.This is a real ""slice of time"" film in that it deals with women who were working, ""like men"" who ""thought like men"" i.e. enjoied and wanted careers; which was considered a real social problem at the time as men came back from the war and wanted their jobs back.  Women were meanwhile enjoing the freedom of having their own jobs their own independence, and this was seen as transgressive, especially if the woman, like this one, was also sexually liberated.The script hits all these notes appropriately, but the awful operatic music hammers away.  Fortunately, that wasn't on the set.  Hedy gives a layered, thoughtful, and - a rarity - a relaxed, humorous, and joyful performance.  She has a ""drunk scene"" that is playful and completely real, a very subtly funny portrayal of being ""pleasantly inebriated.""  All this makes me think this must be who she truly was.  She had just finished a film she had fought for, and was working on this fantastic character who liked working and was interested in science (as she was herself).  It is simply a MUST see for any Hedy Lamar film  (as is THE STRANGE WOMAN for other reasons)- for a glimpse of her entire range.Looking at her bios, this was a turning point where she started her disenchantement with roles she was being offered.  She is beautiful and tempestuous in the later SAMPSON AND DELILAH, but her heart is not in that the way it is in this film.  And she slowed down her acting quite a bit after these.See this to see Hedy Lamar the actress surrounded by a great supporting cast (including Margaret Hamilton - Dorothy's wicked witch), in a film which I feel is her finest work.",5,Lamar the Actress and Woman at her film FINEST.,1143504000,"03 28, 2006",2006,2316,"['What', 'perfect', 'pairing', 'films', 'production', 'role', 'fascinating', 'morally', 'complex', 'STRANGE', 'WOMAN', 'see', 'separate', '5', 'star', 'review', 'Hedy', 'was', 'awarded', 'great', 'murder', 'mystery', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'DISHONORED', 'LADY.I', 'saw', 'very', 'poor', 'VHS', 'transfer', 'not', 'purchased', 'Amazon', 'script', 'wonderful', 'bit', 'melodramatic', 'casting', 'great', 'post', 'production', 'aspects', 'especially', 'music', 'are', 'real', 'disappointment', 'Hedy', 'shines', 'film', 'HER', 'FINEST', 'ACTING', 'WORK', 'ON', 'FILM', 'role', 'complex', 'real', 'portrayal', 'party', 'girl', 'trying', 'straighten', 'out', 'life', 'self', 'when', 'murder', 'suspect.This', 'real', 'slice', 'time', 'film', 'women', 'who', 'were', 'working', 'men', 'who', 'thought', 'men', 'i.e', 'enjoied', 'wanted', 'careers', 'was', 'considered', 'real', 'social', 'problem', 'time', 'men', 'came', 'back', 'war', 'wanted', 'jobs', 'back', 'Women', 'were', 'meanwhile', 'enjoing', 'freedom', 'having', 'own', 'jobs', 'own', 'independence', 'was', 'seen', 'transgressive', 'especially', 'woman', 'one', 'was', 'also', 'sexually', 'liberated.The', 'script', 'notes', 'appropriately', 'awful', 'operatic', 'music', 'hammers', 'away', 'Fortunately', 'was', ""n't"", 'set', 'Hedy', 'layered', 'thoughtful', 'rarity', 'relaxed', 'humorous', 'joyful', 'performance', 'drunk', 'scene', 'playful', 'completely', 'real', 'very', 'subtly', 'funny', 'portrayal', 'being', 'pleasantly', 'inebriated', 'think', 'must', 'be', 'who', 'truly', 'was', 'had', 'just', 'finished', 'film', 'had', 'fought', 'was', 'working', 'fantastic', 'character', 'who', 'liked', 'working', 'was', 'interested', 'science', 'was', 'simply', 'MUST', 'see', 'Hedy', 'Lamar', 'film', 'THE', 'STRANGE', 'WOMAN', 'other', 'reasons', 'glimpse', 'entire', 'range.Looking', 'bios', 'was', 'turning', 'point', 'where', 'started', 'disenchantement', 'roles', 'was', 'being', 'offered', 'beautiful', 'tempestuous', 'later', 'SAMPSON', 'AND', 'DELILAH', 'heart', 'not', 'way', 'film', 'slowed', 'down', 'acting', 'quite', 'bit', 'these.See', 'see', 'Hedy', 'Lamar', 'actress', 'surrounded', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Margaret', 'Hamilton', 'Dorothy', 'wicked', 'witch', 'film', 'feel', 'finest', 'work']",N/A

Hedy Lamarr was more than the ""most beautiful woman in Hollywood"". She never received the respect deserved for her acting ability. Ah, the curse of a physically gorgeous woman! And she was a brain too - inventor of what would become wireless technology. She is superb in both of these films which are probably 2 of her best performances next to ""Samson and Delilah"". The dvd quality is extremely good for the price. I'm always concerned about films in the public domain because print quality varies. Hedy is of course, stunningly beautiful and gives inspired & emotive performances. I always liked her film work and hope that someday, she will receive the overdue praise as a fine actress.

847365,A1B1F6YL4KP3S6,B0002VL03I,Tonio Gas,"[1, 1]","This double feature gives us a good opportunity to watch Hedy Lamarr (who was said to be the most beautiful woman in the world) at the peak of her career. Once accepted that she has a flamboyant beauty, but limited acting skills, both films manage quite well to strengthen the advantages and to detract from the disadvantages. In my opinion, ""Dishonored Lady"" does it better. This typical psychological film noir is a permanent style extravaganza - note that one character says about the Lamarr character that she is ""as beautiful as a PICTURE"". Her character always being a little insecure as a ""two-faced woman"", Lamarrs deficiency as an actress perfectly fits the role! Long before his Disney career, director Robert Stevenson was a fine stylist of expressionist noir, i.e. in ""Jane Eyre"" - and in ""Dishonored Lady"".""The Strange Woman"" is a somehow labored period picture about a (very, very) bad girl in Bangor, Maine, in the first half of the 19th century. Jenny (Lamarr) ist decided to climb the social ladder at any price, which makes her seduce and destroy more than one man (e.g. Louis Hayward and George Sanders). It's strongly entertaining and has some fascinating scenes, but different from ""Dishonored Lady"", the film does explain too much in the dialogue. It is always good when we can SEE what Jenny does, instead of being told. However, we have some interesting exercises in style, symbolism and lighting - but not as constantly as in ""Dishonored Lady"". The picture is directed by Edgar Ulmer, and Douglas Sirk is said to have done some additional directorial work.I would rate ""The Strange Woman"" four stars and ""Dishonored Lady"" five stars.",5,The most beautiful woman in the world in one outstanding and one quite good picture,1279929600,"07 24, 2010",2010,1658,"['double', 'feature', 'good', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'Hedy', 'Lamarr', 'who', 'was', 'said', 'be', 'most', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'world', 'peak', 'career', 'Once', 'accepted', 'flamboyant', 'beauty', 'limited', 'acting', 'skills', 'films', 'manage', 'quite', 'well', 'strengthen', 'advantages', 'detract', 'disadvantages', 'opinion', 'Dishonored', 'Lady', 'better', 'typical', 'psychological', 'film', 'noir', 'permanent', 'style', 'extravaganza', 'note', 'one', 'character', 'Lamarr', 'character', 'as', 'beautiful', 'PICTURE', 'character', 'always', 'being', 'little', 'insecure', 'two-faced', 'woman', 'Lamarrs', 'deficiency', 'actress', 'perfectly', 'role', 'Long', 'Disney', 'career', 'director', 'Robert', 'Stevenson', 'was', 'fine', 'stylist', 'expressionist', 'noir', 'i.e', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'Dishonored', 'Lady', 'Strange', 'Woman', 'somehow', 'labored', 'period', 'picture', 'very', 'very', 'bad', 'girl', 'Bangor', 'Maine', 'first', 'half', '19th', 'century', 'Jenny', 'Lamarr', 'ist', 'decided', 'climb', 'social', 'ladder', 'price', 'seduce', 'destroy', 'more', 'one', 'man', 'e.g', 'Louis', 'Hayward', 'George', 'Sanders', 'strongly', 'entertaining', 'fascinating', 'scenes', 'different', 'Dishonored', 'Lady', 'film', 'explain', 'too', 'much', 'dialogue', 'always', 'good', 'when', 'can', 'SEE', 'what', 'Jenny', 'instead', 'being', 'told', 'However', 'have', 'interesting', 'exercises', 'style', 'symbolism', 'lighting', 'not', 'as', 'constantly', 'Dishonored', 'Lady', 'picture', 'directed', 'Edgar', 'Ulmer', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'said', 'have', 'done', 'additional', 'directorial', 'work.I', 'would', 'rate', 'Strange', 'Woman', 'four', 'stars', 'Dishonored', 'Lady', 'five', 'stars']",N/A
