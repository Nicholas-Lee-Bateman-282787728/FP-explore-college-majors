1177473,A3QZH73OQCUGI6,B001CRQ8K6,Doc Schreiber,"[26, 54]","This is an interesting concept, but... I have a few issues with the movie:1. Too often it sounds like an infomercial, almost irritating. Perhaps, this was unintentional and plain clumsy, but it's there and hard to ignore.2. Bundling a potentially revolutionary concept with a dubious one called ""global warming"" (even flashing pics of Al Gore and stills from his movie). I don't want to get into the whole global warming politics here, but the bottom line is - the two should have never been mixed together.3. Plenty of catchy quotes throughout the movie, but very few meaningful scientific references. To fully benefit from the info presented, you need to go to the website (url in the movie) which provides tons of references. It would take months if not years to read all of them trying to verify all or most of the claims in the movie.4. Spectacular claims, such as substantial reductions in blood cholesterol levels over amazingly short periods of time, just by switching to non-animal diet. Similar claims regarding spontaneous remissions of advanced cancers etc. Again, no solid, unbiased data from clinical research to support these, no imaging or laboratory evidence from the patients who allegedly recovered or substantially improved.5. There are constant undertones of conspiracy by big pharma, big food industry, lobbies etc. No matter how real these are, their role seems to be overstated.6. Towards the end of the movie, there is a short segment that is a fairly typical PETA propaganda. Just like with misplaced global warming, why inject something like this into the movie that is supposed to explain the health benefits of a certain diet? It would have been better to simply state a point in question, as clearly as possible, and document it with some compelling scientific data, instead of spicing it up with junk science and junk politics.Even with all the described flaws, for some this may be a worthwhile info. Kinda elementary school or junior high level. If, however, in this day and age you still need someone to tell you that diets heavily based on animal products are not healthy, you probably don't need a movie like this one to begin with. Food can be a dangerous addiction, a lot more complex than just a simple matter of choices. It is a reflection of many layers of a society and should be addressed accordingly. This movie takes an important step in scratching the surface of the problem, but does it in a very awkward and at times misguided way.",2,Could have been...,1241222400,"05 2, 2009",2009,2479,"['interesting', 'concept', 'have', 'few', 'issues', 'movie:1', 'Too', 'often', 'infomercial', 'almost', 'irritating', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'unintentional', 'plain', 'clumsy', 'there', 'hard', 'ignore.2', 'Bundling', 'potentially', 'revolutionary', 'concept', 'dubious', 'one', 'called', 'global', 'warming', 'even', 'flashing', 'pics', 'Al', 'Gore', 'stills', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'whole', 'global', 'warming', 'politics', 'here', 'bottom', 'line', 'two', 'should', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'mixed', 'together.3', 'Plenty', 'catchy', 'quotes', 'movie', 'very', 'few', 'meaningful', 'scientific', 'references', 'fully', 'benefit', 'info', 'presented', 'need', 'go', 'website', 'url', 'movie', 'tons', 'references', 'would', 'take', 'months', 'not', 'years', 'read', 'trying', 'verify', 'most', 'claims', 'movie.4', 'Spectacular', 'claims', 'such', 'substantial', 'reductions', 'blood', 'cholesterol', 'levels', 'amazingly', 'short', 'periods', 'time', 'just', 'switching', 'non-animal', 'diet', 'Similar', 'claims', 'regarding', 'spontaneous', 'remissions', 'advanced', 'cancers', 'etc', 'Again', 'solid', 'unbiased', 'data', 'clinical', 'research', 'support', 'imaging', 'laboratory', 'evidence', 'patients', 'who', 'allegedly', 'recovered', 'substantially', 'improved.5', 'are', 'constant', 'undertones', 'conspiracy', 'big', 'pharma', 'big', 'food', 'industry', 'etc', 'matter', 'how', 'real', 'are', 'role', 'be', 'overstated.6', 'end', 'movie', 'short', 'segment', 'fairly', 'typical', 'PETA', 'propaganda', 'Just', 'misplaced', 'global', 'warming', 'why', 'inject', 'something', 'movie', 'supposed', 'explain', 'health', 'benefits', 'certain', 'diet', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'simply', 'state', 'point', 'question', 'as', 'clearly', 'possible', 'document', 'compelling', 'scientific', 'data', 'instead', 'spicing', 'up', 'junk', 'science', 'junk', 'politics.Even', 'described', 'flaws', 'may', 'be', 'worthwhile', 'info', 'Kinda', 'elementary', 'school', 'junior', 'high', 'level', 'however', 'day', 'age', 'still', 'need', 'someone', 'tell', 'heavily', 'based', 'animal', 'products', 'are', 'not', 'healthy', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'movie', 'one', 'begin', 'Food', 'can', 'be', 'dangerous', 'addiction', 'lot', 'more', 'complex', 'just', 'simple', 'matter', 'choices', 'reflection', 'many', 'layers', 'society', 'should', 'be', 'addressed', 'accordingly', 'movie', 'important', 'step', 'scratching', 'surface', 'problem', 'very', 'awkward', 'times', 'misguided', 'way']",Eating - 3rd Edition

Is that maybe the reason it is called the ""sad"" diet (meaning : standard American diet)?I became a vegetarian more than five years ago.  I feel this documentary sums up very well all the reasons why I became a vegetarian : to stop animal cruelty, to lower my ecological footprint, and to improve my health.The first part of the documentary is dedicated to the link between eating meat and becoming sick.On cancer, the point made in this documentary is that it will easily be held under control by a healthy immune system.  No doubt your immune system will improve if you eat a plant-based diet.  Cancer being caused by a dietary deficiency is also the core perspective of an excellent book by Edward Griffin World Without Cancer: The Story of Vitamin B17 (New edition revised and updated).However, I felt the documentary didn't really insist in eating *organic* food.  Dr. Epstein sees a clear correlation between the introduction of pesticides and the occurrence of cancer.  So you also have to take this risk into consideration.  I see no benefit in swallowing all the new fancy chemicals mankind introduced in the environment since the '40s of the last century, since our immune system never had to deal with DDT or PCB before.What was totally new to me is that you can *completely* cure type-II-diabetes by changing the ""sad"" diet to a plant-based diet, in one week time - two weeks tops!  Wow !  This statement is convincing, since four doctors and therapists are interviewed and confirming their experiences : Dr. John McDougall, Dr. Thomas Lodi, Brenda Copp and Charlotte Gerson.Finally, this documentary focuses on our environment and the cruel way the industrial society deals with animals.  This has an ecological impact on the whole world.  Tropical forests are cut just to make room for more animals - and the crops to feed them.

While I think it has some good information, one thing that did bug me was right at the beginning. It cited how years ago when people lived on more plant-based diets, things like heart disease and cancer were rare. Now this may be in fact true, but what did these people die of? They didn't live forever, but the DVD makes no mention of what diseases they did get. The DVD just skips right over the logical question.Like I said, this part was right at the beginning and slightly tainted my viewing of the rest of the DVD (like they were purposely avoiding information or something.) I did like the testimony from the interviewees and thought helped the viewers really relate to the information. I would recommend this as part (certainly not all) of your research on trying to live a more healthy lifestyle and with rethinking your eating habits.",4,Good DVD to help with your diet/lifestyle decisions,1231977600,"01 15, 2009",2009,934,"['DVD', 'benefits', 'plant-based', 'instead', 'animal-based', 'diet', 'think', 'good', 'information', 'one', 'thing', 'did', 'bug', 'was', 'right', 'beginning', 'cited', 'how', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'people', 'lived', 'more', 'plant-based', 'diets', 'things', 'heart', 'disease', 'cancer', 'were', 'rare', 'Now', 'may', 'be', 'fact', 'true', 'what', 'did', 'people', 'die', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'forever', 'DVD', 'mention', 'what', 'did', 'get', 'DVD', 'just', 'skips', 'right', 'logical', 'question.Like', 'said', 'part', 'was', 'right', 'beginning', 'slightly', 'tainted', 'viewing', 'rest', 'DVD', 'were', 'purposely', 'avoiding', 'information', 'something', 'did', 'testimony', 'interviewees', 'thought', 'helped', 'viewers', 'really', 'relate', 'information', 'would', 'recommend', 'part', 'certainly', 'not', 'research', 'trying', 'live', 'more', 'healthy', 'lifestyle', 'rethinking', 'eating', 'habits']",Eating - 3rd Edition
