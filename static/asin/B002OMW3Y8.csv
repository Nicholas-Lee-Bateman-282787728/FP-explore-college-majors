First, it has a few parts that are just plain gross.  And there are a few places they pause the movie to talk (didn't care for that).  Last, there are a couple parts to the movie that are too loud compared to the rest of the movie/riffs.  That being said, it was done by the same people we all know and love and still has plenty of good laughs and fun.",3,"I love this series, but this is not my favorite movie",1377734400,"08 29, 2013",2013,453,"['love', 'movie', 'riffing', 'guys', 'do', 'However', 'movie', 'couple', 'parts', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'First', 'few', 'parts', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'gross', 'are', 'few', 'places', 'pause', 'movie', 'talk', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Last', 'are', 'couple', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'too', 'loud', 'compared', 'rest', 'movie/riffs', 'being', 'said', 'was', 'done', 'same', 'people', 'know', 'love', 'still', 'plenty', 'good', 'laughs', 'fun']",N/A
1281332,A2PA9ACXDNHFID,B002OMW3Y8,Scott M,"[3, 4]","Cinematic Titanic, 'The Oozing Skull'(#1):Cinematic Titanic is an off-shoot of MST3k (a.k.a Mystery Science Theater 3000).Joel Hodgson created both shows.This is the first release on DVD. I have seen all the MST3k releasedvolumes (1-20), and have all seven releases of Cinematic Titanic - and I think The Oozing Skull is now my all time favorite (although I have not seen All of the MST3k movies - they had like 160 different ones).The 'riffs' on here are fantastic!! (riffs are the funny comments made by the gang in-between dialog). Only once did I think of a riff here that was 'missed' - where a man hands a woman a handgun - I think he could have said something like 'Have mercy on yourself - end your pain of experiencing the rest of this movie'. A great movie for the guys (and gal) to riff on.I love the Cinematic Titanic's theme song; Thanks to J. Elvis Weinstein(the original 'Tom Servo'. and a point of trivia, Josh Weinstein chose 'Elvis' as he is an Elvis Costello fan).A trailer of this movie can be seen on Youtube (as well as other Cinematic Titanic movies).  And there is a website for Cinematic Titanic.I have seen them 'live' and the meet and greet was wonderful!I have watched this 'episode' twice and pick up more humor and jokes each time.I can't wait for more Cinematic Titanic studio releases!This movie is in color, and total running time is: 1:20:56If you love MST3K, I think you'll love 'Cinematic', and if you love 'Cinematic'- oh just take my word - and see these movies. :)Scott MacNeil",5,"Cinematic Titnaic, 'The Oozing Skull' (#1)",1302739200,"04 14, 2011",2011,1516,"['Cinematic', 'Titanic', ""'The"", 'Oozing', 'Skull', '1', 'Cinematic', 'Titanic', 'off-shoot', 'MST3k', 'a.k.a', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', '3000', '.Joel', 'Hodgson', 'created', 'shows.This', 'first', 'release', 'DVD', 'have', 'seen', 'MST3k', 'releasedvolumes', '1-20', 'have', 'seven', 'releases', 'Cinematic', 'Titanic', 'think', 'Oozing', 'Skull', 'now', 'time', 'favorite', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'All', 'MST3k', 'movies', 'had', '160', 'different', 'ones', '.The', ""'riffs"", 'here', 'are', 'fantastic', 'riffs', 'are', 'funny', 'comments', 'made', 'gang', 'in-between', 'dialog', 'Only', 'once', 'did', 'think', 'riff', 'here', 'was', ""'missed"", 'where', 'man', 'woman', 'handgun', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'said', 'something', ""'Have"", 'mercy', 'end', 'pain', 'experiencing', 'rest', 'movie', 'great', 'movie', 'guys', 'gal', 'riff', 'on.I', 'love', 'Cinematic', 'Titanic', 'theme', 'song', 'Thanks', 'J.', 'Elvis', 'Weinstein', 'original', ""'Tom"", 'Servo', 'point', 'trivia', 'Josh', 'Weinstein', 'chose', ""'Elvis"", 'Elvis', 'Costello', 'fan', 'trailer', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'Youtube', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'Cinematic', 'Titanic', 'movies', 'website', 'Cinematic', 'Titanic.I', 'have', 'seen', ""'live"", 'meet', 'greet', 'was', 'wonderful', 'have', 'watched', ""'episode"", 'twice', 'pick', 'up', 'more', 'humor', 'jokes', 'time.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'more', 'Cinematic', 'Titanic', 'studio', 'movie', 'color', 'total', 'running', 'time', '1:20:56If', 'love', 'MST3K', 'think', ""'ll"", 'love', ""'Cinematic"", 'love', ""'Cinematic'-"", 'oh', 'just', 'take', 'word', 'see', 'movies', 'Scott', 'MacNeil']",N/A
1281333,A3V03HSQS3SFLU,B002OMW3Y8,S. Marzioli,"[10, 10]","Cinematic Titanic includes every original cast members of the show Mystery Science Theater 3000, sans Mike Nelson, Bill Corbet and Kevin Murphy (who started Rifftrax). The Oozing Skull was their first release.  I purchased the movie soon after it was pressed, when the company just started and was still getting on their feet.  As their first release, it was a mixed bag.  They sent the film in a white, paper slip with no artwork of any sort.  It was a bit disappointing.  (Later, they offered, free of charge, a downloadable outer insert to print out and include with the dvd at your leisure).Still, what I was looking for was riffing magic, not inserts!  I popped the disc in and watched the show.  The first thing I noticed, which was quite different from the folks at Rifftrax, was that Cinematic Titanic chose to include themselves over the footage with silhouettes.  The silhouettes were telling; these wonderful folks had obviously aged since MST3K was on the air.  But the important thing was whether or not it was funny.  It was!  With the numerous cast members involved all at once, it was a cluster cuss (wink, nod at FMF fans) of riffing frenzy.  Just like Joel and Mike and the Robots, the silhouettes also interacted with the film directly, trying to touch characters or props on the screen.  It was good fun!While I wouldn't place this film amongst my favorite riffed movies, it definitely has a place in my MST3K and related dvd collection.  In fact, Cinematic Titanic has since become a worthy successor of the MST3K legacy and deserves a proper placed beside its more successful Rifftrax counterpart.",4,They're BACK!,1299456000,"03 7, 2011",2011,1619,"['Cinematic', 'Titanic', 'original', 'cast', 'members', 'show', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', '3000', 'Mike', 'Nelson', 'Bill', 'Corbet', 'Kevin', 'Murphy', 'who', 'started', 'Rifftrax', 'Oozing', 'Skull', 'was', 'first', 'release', 'purchased', 'movie', 'soon', 'was', 'pressed', 'when', 'company', 'just', 'started', 'was', 'still', 'getting', 'feet', 'first', 'release', 'was', 'mixed', 'bag', 'sent', 'film', 'white', 'paper', 'slip', 'artwork', 'sort', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'Later', 'offered', 'free', 'charge', 'downloadable', 'outer', 'insert', 'print', 'out', 'include', 'dvd', 'leisure', '.Still', 'what', 'was', 'looking', 'was', 'riffing', 'magic', 'not', 'popped', 'disc', 'watched', 'show', 'first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'was', 'quite', 'different', 'folks', 'Rifftrax', 'was', 'Cinematic', 'Titanic', 'chose', 'include', 'footage', 'silhouettes', 'silhouettes', 'were', 'telling', 'wonderful', 'folks', 'had', 'obviously', 'aged', 'MST3K', 'was', 'air', 'important', 'thing', 'was', 'not', 'was', 'funny', 'was', 'numerous', 'cast', 'members', 'involved', 'once', 'was', 'cluster', 'cuss', 'wink', 'nod', 'FMF', 'fans', 'riffing', 'frenzy', 'Just', 'Joel', 'Mike', 'Robots', 'silhouettes', 'also', 'interacted', 'film', 'directly', 'trying', 'touch', 'characters', 'props', 'screen', 'was', 'good', 'fun', 'would', ""n't"", 'place', 'film', 'amongst', 'favorite', 'riffed', 'movies', 'definitely', 'place', 'MST3K', 'related', 'dvd', 'collection', 'fact', 'Cinematic', 'Titanic', 'become', 'worthy', 'successor', 'MST3K', 'legacy', 'proper', 'placed', 'more', 'successful', 'Rifftrax', 'counterpart']",N/A
