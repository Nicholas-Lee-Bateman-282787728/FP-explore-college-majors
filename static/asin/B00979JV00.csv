1586576,ALC5AAS4ONNPT,B00979JV00,Amy W.,"[0, 0]","My husband and I are late-comers to Downton Abbey.....we kept hearing people talk about how good it was, and I tried to find it online or on PBS so we could start from season 1, but it was nowhere to be found.  Soooo, I just bit the bullet and ordered this set of DVD's.  We started watching and it was ok -the first couple of episodes seemed to be getting to know the characters and things like that.  We also love Foyle's War and noticed it does the same thing, then BANG all of a sudden by the 3rd episode you find yourself drawn in, paying a little closer attention, and then looking forward to the next episode.  (Is this somewhat normal for British tv?).  We literally watched this set (all 3 seasons) within a week.  Every spare evening or weekend we did nothing but watch as we couldn't wait to see what happened next.  Outstanding acting, the characters are divine (for example the man who plays Carson is probably the most PERFECT actor in a role I have ever seen), and of course the costumes and setting are spectacular.  The story lines are believable, everything is authentic down to the most minute detail, and you get to know the characters so well you almost feel as if they are real friends in your life.  It is a rare thing when I start to personally care about characters on a television show, but Downton Abbey has successfully captured me.  Another part of the shows brilliance is Maggie Smith.  Her character is a hoot and we love it when she says something under her breath or in a way we know it is meant as an insult, but she does it with such class we often burst out laughing.  I only hope Downton Abbey will be around for many years.  Now that I am hooked, I can't imagine not watching it.

1586590,AUX7KVELDYZZ6,B00979JV00,"Brett H ""pentangle""","[14, 16]","This DVD set is a real treat as it includes all 24 episodes to date. There are seven episodes from the first series, eight each from the second and third, plus the 2011 Christmas special which was arguably the best single episode so far; it was certainly one of the most dramatic!The three series so far have taken us from 1912, just after the sinking of the Titanic, up to 1921. The circumstances surrounding each series have been in contrast with each other. The first series ran up to the start of the First World War, and the one of the main thrusts of the story line was the matchmaking within the Crawley family and the various financial and social influences on the choice of a suitable partner.The second series moves on to the war years, when Downton Abbey had been converted into a convalescent home for injured servicemen. The time setting is from the Battle of the Somme up to the end of the war. This background contributes to some very interesting scripts, and whilst some felt that it did not live up to the first series, personally I thought it was excellent, but different.The Christmas special and the third series take place from late 1919 into 1921. The first features a very dramatic trial, and in the third series the household is far more back to the life of an aristocratic family as it was in the first series although the estate faces major challenges in the post war period and a need to embrace change if Downton is to survive. A major feature of the show is the interaction between the family and those who serve them `below stairs' and there are many strong performances amongst both groups. However, a review of Downton would not be complete without mention of Maggie Smith who, as Violet has some very funny lines and dominates every scene she is in. Shirley Maclaine was introduced in the third series, presumably as a foil to Violet and presumably to please American viewers, and the rather frosty relationship between the two worked very well.I am sure that there will be few viewers who have not seen Downton, which is the most successful costume drama since Brideshead Revisited some thirty years ago. However if there are any out there this will be an excellent introduction to the show for them. Even if, like me, you have seen every episode to date you will enjoy revisiting them. Although this is the definitive box set to date, purchasers should be aware that there will be another 2 hour Christmas Special in 2012. I imagine that this set was rushed out to take advantage of the Christmas trade, but it is a shame it was not delayed for a couple of months so that it could include the 2012 Christmas Special. It has now been announced that there will be a fourth series followed by a 2013 Christmas Special.For those of you interested in extra features, this set includes what was included in the individual DVDs for Series 1,2 and 3.

1586635,AL9WKVMRI6GFB,B00979JV00,JMM,"[0, 0]","There is something special about ""Downton Abbey"". It has all the trappings of a typical British costume drama, but it's got an extra spark that's allowed it to travel overseas and find great success here in the United States. I am a male in his 20s who enjoys dark TV shows like ""Dexter"" and ""Breaking Bad"" - on the surface, I'm not exactly in the demographic you'd think would be interested in ""Downton Abbey"". But I gave the show a chance, and I really enjoy it. So I'd encourage you to give it a chance too. Between ""Downton Abbey"" and the BBC's ""Sherlock"", I think Britain has two of the best shows of recent years.As with any great TV show, ""Downton Abbey"" has a strong narrative and well-written characters. One thing that sounded a bit off-putting about the show was the idea of rich folks living in their castle with a bunch of servants. But as you watch, its obvious that the Crawleys (who own the estate) care very much for their staff. And when financial troubles hit the family, they do their very best to keep all their staff on payroll. They consider it their duty, and even their honor, to employ as many people as possible and treat them well (this is something that large companies today could learn from).One of the most fun aspects is that this world is unfamiliar to most of us. The show's timeline so far spans from 1912 to the early 1920s. People spoke, dressed, and acted differently than they do now. Various world events from the time period are referenced in the show - the sinking of the Titanic and the British campaigns of World War I are two in particular that greatly affect the series and its characters.This show feels very cinematic - the locations, the costumes, the sound design and the music are all fantastic. Despite TV programs having limited resources, this show is an example of what talented directors can achieve on a modest budget - the show feels every bit as grand in scope as a Hollywood feature film.** If you're a Prime member, you can stream all three seasons for free right now on Amazon Instant Video.",5,"""Downton Abbey"" Seasons 1-3",1379721600,"09 21, 2013",2013,2054,"['something', 'special', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'trappings', 'typical', 'British', 'costume', 'drama', 'got', 'extra', 'spark', 'allowed', 'travel', 'overseas', 'find', 'great', 'success', 'here', 'United', 'States', 'am', 'male', '20s', 'who', 'dark', 'TV', 'shows', 'Dexter', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'surface', ""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'demographic', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'gave', 'show', 'chance', 'really', 'enjoy', 'So', ""'d"", 'encourage', 'give', 'chance', 'too', 'Between', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'BBC', 'Sherlock', 'think', 'Britain', 'two', 'best', 'shows', 'recent', 'years.As', 'great', 'TV', 'show', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'strong', 'narrative', 'well-written', 'characters', 'One', 'thing', 'sounded', 'bit', 'off-putting', 'show', 'was', 'idea', 'rich', 'folks', 'living', 'castle', 'bunch', 'servants', 'watch', 'obvious', 'Crawleys', 'who', 'own', 'estate', 'care', 'very', 'much', 'staff', 'when', 'financial', 'troubles', 'hit', 'family', 'do', 'very', 'best', 'keep', 'staff', 'payroll', 'consider', 'duty', 'even', 'honor', 'employ', 'many', 'people', 'possible', 'treat', 'well', 'something', 'large', 'companies', 'today', 'could', 'learn', '.One', 'most', 'fun', 'aspects', 'world', 'unfamiliar', 'most', 'show', 'timeline', 'so', 'far', 'spans', '1912', 'early', '1920s', 'People', 'spoke', 'dressed', 'acted', 'differently', 'do', 'now', 'Various', 'world', 'events', 'time', 'period', 'are', 'referenced', 'show', 'sinking', 'Titanic', 'British', 'campaigns', 'World', 'War', 'are', 'two', 'particular', 'greatly', 'affect', 'series', 'characters.This', 'show', 'very', 'cinematic', 'locations', 'costumes', 'sound', 'design', 'music', 'are', 'fantastic', 'TV', 'programs', 'having', 'limited', 'resources', 'show', 'example', 'what', 'talented', 'directors', 'can', 'achieve', 'modest', 'budget', 'show', 'bit', 'grand', 'scope', 'Hollywood', 'feature', 'film', '**', ""'re"", 'Prime', 'member', 'can', 'stream', 'three', 'seasons', 'free', 'right', 'now', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'Video']",Downton Abbey: Series 1-3 + Christmas Special

It is superb writing, the finest acting, exceptional cinematography and art design, gorgeous scoring, absolute perfection. I was skeptical about starting to watch this series, not being a fan of the Upstairs/Downstairs genre but was talked into trying it, so bought the first season DVD and was instantly hooked. Rapidly went through the entire series, and eventually my DVD player began to shows signs of aging. Bought a BluRay player and immediately replaced the DVDs with this entire series package. It was like watching it anew. The detail, color, and clarity are astonishing, everything from pores in the actors skin, to beads on dresses, to booktitles on shelves. So much detail, and so gorgeous. The scenery and sets are breathtaking.Everyone else has gone into elaborate detail about Maggie Smith, Michele Dockery and company, so I  will leave it at get the BluRay version if you can, it's equisite!!
