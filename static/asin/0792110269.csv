In a vast amount of war films if the man is afraid or gun crazy for his country than he is weak and useless instead of being human. All holden wants is to get back to his family and life in one piece and through out the film he more than makes that clear but there are glimpses of a stronger man than we think he has been condtioned to not let the war affect his wife Grace Kelly or their two daughters. The combat scenes are well done and hold up very well today but the script and Holden's acting is the true saving grace of this film. The raw emtotions of conflict and duty is just amazing in this film. For once the true fact about men at war is shown-that when a war breaks out and you stand in the mist of battle it's not for your country you are fighting for but to remain alive and to live for what you have.

124405,A2UUWETDYA2EKV,0792110269,Douglas Doepke,"[8, 8]","For those who remember it, the war in Korea remains an enigma from murky beginning to wobbly close (1950-1953). It wasn't even called a `war'. Instead politicians dubbed it a `police action', which of course fooled no one (30,000 plus, dead Americans). Toko-ri stands as perhaps the only film to capture the popular uncertainty of that conflict. Some reviewers characterize the movie as anti-war, but it's not. Instead it reflects an American public's  longing for peacetime following the horrific sacrifices of WWII and the fresh sacrifices of a new war they neither understood nor desired. In the movie, Fredric March's fatherly admiral makes the official case for intervention. In a key scene with a skeptical Grace Kelly, he lectures on communist aggression and the necessity of stopping them where they stand. In a routine actioner that would have been enough. It's not enough for William Holden's Captain Brubaker, however. And the fact that the Holden character continues to question his personal role reflects the mixed feelings of ordinary Americans, who continued to be torn between patriotic duty, on one hand, and the exotic nature of the conflict, on the other. To the film's lasting credit, the ending does not cop-out in a blaze of heroics that might have undercut the script's ambivalent message. And it is this message of moral uncertainty that makes Bridges arguably the most  accurate memorandum from that long-ago war.The movie itself remains an A-grade production with some fine aerial photography, shipboard action, and special effects. It's also one of Holden's best  understated performances, superior to his Oscar role in Stalag 17. Not to be overlooked is the Mickey Rooney character which remains a revealing one. His buoyant hijinks and rowdy behavior amount to a holdover of a familiar WWII stereotype. Yet the clowning here fails to gel with the prevailing mood, and would vanish from serious treatments by the time Vietnam rolled around. Then too, by the time of the movie's release (1954), audiences were eager to get back to the certainties of WWII, and studios responded with a spate of popular WWII fare, such as, Mr. Roberts (1955), Battle Cry (1955), and Operation Petticoat (1959). Except for a straggler or two, Hollywood would make no more Korean warr films. And so, the process of forgetting that ""Forgotten War"" had begun. But, in retrospect, this was one of the few films of the decade to foreshadow the Vietnam trauma that was to follow, while the final shot of Holden's Captain Brubaker proved to be far more suggestive of war on the Asian mainland than critics could have anticipated (Toko-ri was not well received).

Imagine this film being released today, but with Iraq instead of Korea as its background.  This movie is all the more amazing, then, on several counts.  The script is a good adaptation of the original novel by James Michener, who based it on actual events  (just as many of the heros in ""Tales of the South Pacific"" were also based on real people). But this movie was made by artists, not by militants armed only with a one-sided axe to grind. It's a technically poetic homage to courage and sacrifice, and to the futility that war makes of heroism.  The respect Michener gave to fighting men and women is obvious in the book and the movie -- and so is the underlying theme, unspoken and understated, of war as waste.  That said, it's also remarkable that the combat scenes were filmed in '54 -- no computers, no fancy optics of today.  Amazingly, director Mark Robson used models (yes!) for many sequences, and perfected special effects he'd later use in ""Von Ryan's Express"".  Even as you watch the combat scenes, you're utterly convinced that it's 100% authentic newsreel footage.  On technical and performance merits alone, ""Bridges"" rates 5 stars.  Philosophically it gets a little muddled, but the overall effect by the time the movie ends is unforgettable.  Technically, I don't think any combat film equalled it until Spielberg (combat aircraft fans will be mezmerized by action shots of planes that have all but disappeared today), while intellectually it's a match for the earlier ""Story of G.I. Joe"".  Both films manage to glorify courage and dedication  without over-glorifying war -- a feat in itself.  The DVD transfer isn't perfect (apparently the original negs were unavailable), but the Technicolor is dazzling, the original mono sound is clean and, when needed, powerful. The chemistry between Holden and Kelly is all too obvious (they developed an affair during the filming).  Performances from Paramount's regulars are right-on.  Sadly, there are no DVD extras except a trailer - a major omission for a film of this stature.  Astonishing in its day, it still packs a wallop.  This film was released while the Korean War still raged -- the war, in fact, never ended.

124419,A11W5PP5FM494X,0792110269,Jake H. -- Chicago,"[2, 2]","I see that some regard the film as anti-war, or, at least, anti-Korean War.  I didn't see it that way.  The justification for the war is challenged in dialogue briefly, and then just as briefly defended.  I don't think the film is taking a stand one way or the other on that particular question.  Still, it's a different sort of war movie with a much different sort of war hero.  He's realistically ambivalent.  He's not a young hotshot, eager to fight.  He's not a ""Hurt Locker""-style adrenaline junkie who doesn't know how to live a normal life (a character type with which I think we have a bit of a perverse fascination these days).  He's not a steely-eyed warrior type of the ""strong, silent"" mold.  He's not even really the ordinary Tom Hanks sort who, though reasonably scared, carries out his duty with quiet courage and affability.The fact is, when Holden's called up, he's resentful.  Unlike Jeremy Renner in Hurt Locker, he desperately wants to return to his family.  (Married to Grace Kelly with two young daughters, it's easy to understand why.)  He's highly skilled, to be sure, but he's not a fighter pilot anymore, or so he thought.  He's a Denver lawyer and family man who, right up to the end, isn't convinced why he's got to be in Korea, and he's angry that instead of getting on with his life, he has to face death, something for which he increasingly lacks the energy.  With each scrape, he seems to lose more and more patience.  He does his duty with great competence and professionalism -- he almost never loses his cool -- and we might also say great courage.  But his courage comes by way of reluctant resignation and bitterness.  He can't stand listening to indifferent civilians cheer a football game, a mocking of war.  He can't stand the racket of the jets on the deck of the carrier as he tries to write a letter to his wife if he dies.  He can't stand watching the video from the photo mission through the heavily defended Toko-Ri valley, suggesting that it will be a miracle to make it through the real mission (to destroy the bridges) without being brought down.  The movie consists of this good man being drastically, and, we begin to feel, outrageously put upon, suffocated by the war and his own unshakeable dedication.  For example, he sacrifices a rare night with his family to bail Mickey Rooney out of a Tokyo military jail.  Rooney, a helicopter pilot, had rescued Holden from the ocean after Holden ""ditched"" his plane, and, Holden says, he'd do just about anything for Rooney in return.  The switch in this different sort of war movie is that Rooney, unlikeable away from his chopper, doesn't really deserve the benefit of Holden's fraternal devotion.

Where do we get such men?""They were my friends, these men of whom he speaks. I served with them, and serviced the very airplanes shown in the movie. The Korean War was my war.This is a fine movie. It correctly and accurately depicts life on an aircraft carrier (except for the depiction played by Mickey Rooney--there were no clowns in the service from which I am retired.) Even then, the scenes in Japan on liberty were like the real thing.The writer also took license in the closeness of a young lieutenant to an admiral, and the sequences showing the pilot's family, were unlikely events, but such quibbles are minor details.The airplanes, the fear which the pilots mastered, the courage required when facing capable enemies who are determined to kill you, the crash landing of the F9F (How did they do that so realistically? I don't know. It was not done with a model) the preposterous, irrational incongruity of finding inglorious death in a muddy ditch in a strange land in the afternoon, after breakfasting with your friends in a familiar wardroom--all of these things depict war accurately as seen by Navy pilots, and especially the ""Forgotten War"": the Korean war.If you would learn about war, see this movie.

We don't seem to be able to do that, regrettably, so To Ko Ri becomes that much more poignant.The other area I wrinkle my brow at is the Grace Kelly role. Seems wasted, unecessary. We already know that Harry Brubaker is a decent guy and we don't need carefully angled shots of Grace's not-so-modest bosom to reveal to us that yes, she's a babe and Brubaker loves her.But the rest of the movie is a portrait of what men and women do at war from 'This Band of Brothers' which is an unbelievably brilliant story by Spielberg and Hanks of the landing/drop at Normandy through Jim Brady's chronicles of Korea to Vietnam to Iraq. They do jobs. The chopper drivers, the CAG, Admiral Tarant, 'Paddles,' it's men and women at work.The final scene is not a Hollywood ending but it is a real ending. Absolutely brilliant. That there is so much knowledge, compassion and understanding over this forgotten war by the Amazon reviewers and on the Internet impacted somewhat by this movie 52 years later, is a credit to those who saw service there and Michner's excellent novel.

Kelly is wasted or is a waste; she lacks the spontaneity of Hepburn and tries to act the Diva with small beady eyes that rarely open. Why was she called beautiful remains a mystery, obviously if American men wanted to sleep with Nancy Reagan, I reckon Kelly was OK. Considering the fact that had Nancy been released in Salem of 17th Century she would have been an automatic candidate to be burnt on stake. Anyways some aerial shots are worth watching and remain quite unparalleled, but the background music is very poor and, that, is a tragedy, since many a film had little content but scenes were very vastly enhanced due to effective background score. In this film some visual content were superb but the music lets down as it either remains absent or fails to create a menacing atmosphere to jell with Holden's misgiving about the mission. Only the last few minutes are excellent but the rest of the movie looks like a documentary on naval aircrafts with few scenes replete with gross sexism and racism. Rooney is quite good and Holden holds good with a remarkably controlled performance, rest are mediocre and sermonize.

I remember that one of our local movie theaters had a huge bill-board on it's face advertising the movie.  Back then as a 'kid',  mostly the aerial sequences, and not the 'family tensions' that evolved in the movie captured my attention.  Years later, as an adult, the picture took on another meaning, and that 'meaning' is still a force today with our military involved in far-away places, much like Korea was almost 60 years ago.  The story is plausible and current:  just as during the Korean 'conflict', today, vet's have been called up, and even 're-re-called' to serve.  Anyway, back to the movie:  William Holden (Brubaker) had been 'called up' after serving during WWII.  He is bitter, as he not only has a wife with children, but an established legal career.  He 'does his job' as a Naval pilot, and in the end, pays the 'ultimate price' for his efforts. The supporting cast (Grace Kelly, Mickey Rooney, and Fredric March) do a pretty good job, especially March.  One of the negative points about the movie:  Mickey Rooney, altho doing a very creditable job in the flick, would have never made it as a pilot of ANY aircraft in the service, because of his height.  But, then again, Hollywood has been known to take a lot of 'artistic liberties' over the years.  Bottom line;  this movie is, in a lot of ways, recent and current events.

124448,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0792110269,Reviewer,"[84, 84]","The Korean War is the setting for ""The Bridges At Toko-Ri,"" a story of individual sacrifice and the high cost of freedom, from director Mark Robson.  Navy fighter-pilot Harry Brubaker (William Holden), a veteran of  World War II, is called to serve again when the conflict in Korea  escalates, which takes him away from his wife, Nancy (Grace Kelly), two  young children and a successful law practice.  When his plane goes down  after a mission, into the sea just short of the carrier, he survives; but  he bitterly questions the fairness of what he has been asked to do, while  everyone back home is able to go on with the routine of their lives,  uninterrupted.  Rear Admiral George Tarrant (Fredric March), a man who has  had his own share of personal tragedy (he looks upon Brubaker as the son he  has lost to the war, himself), tells Brubaker it's a matter of distance; we  do this because we're here; back home they're only doing just as you would  be doing if you were there.  When Brubaker is granted shore leave, strings  are pulled, and arrangements are made for Nancy and the children to join  him; a brief respite, after which he must return to face his most  formidable challenge yet, flying against the bridges that span the canyons  at Toko-Ri.  Very probably a suicide mission, it is nevertheless believed  that knocking out these particular bridges could bring about a turning  point in the war, and Lieutenant Brubaker is called upon once again to play  a pivotal roll in deciding the outcome.  An excellent supporting cast  ably brings to life the characters that infuse this drama with humanity.  Mickey Rooney is unforgettable as Mike Forney, the fighting, Irish  helicopter pilot who fishes Brubaker out of the sea when his plane crashes.  Memorable as well are Earl Holliman (Nestor Gamidge, Forney's partner),  Robert Strauss (Beer Barrel), Charles McGraw (Commander Wayne Lee), Keiko  Awaji (Kimiko) and Willis bouchey (Captain Evans).  An excellent precursor  to the more recent ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and ""U-571,"" ""The Bridges At  Toko-Ri"" is an intimate study of individual courage and responsibility, and  of the moral fortitude of which man is capable in times of crisis.  There  is a finality to the climax of this film that underscores the intense  personal aspects of the larger conflict, and of the price demanded by  certain individuals chosen to fulfill a seemingly random destiny.  At the  end of the movie, Admiral Tarrant sums it up succinctly when he ponders  aloud:  ""Where do we get such men?""

124456,A11BZ39QSLERNI,0792110269,T-Rexx,"[4, 4]","This 1954 movie narrates the story of a few F-9F Panther fighter-bomber pilots of the USS CV-34 Oriskany who must fly a perilous mission against a network of train bridges in North Korean territory during the eponymous conflict. One of the main characters is a mature pilot who ""was volunteered"" for serving as pilot whereas he is married, has kids and a successful job as a lawyer back in the US. What he gains in maturity is lost to self-control, which leads him to his final demise. The story is thus simple. Although a few scenes do underline the fact that the main character has a full, rich private life, the movie's primarily about the hard life of sea-borne military aircraft pilots during the tough, unforgiving Korean conflict. In itself, the story would not award a 5-star rating to this movie.However, in terms of documentary on rare aircraft operations, it is like striking gold for any aviation enthusiast! The main workhorse is the Panther, which is used to conduct unescorted strike missions in support of ground troops deep in Korean territory. Beyond this aircraft, the beginning of the film is marred with footage of some exotic, rare aircraft types such as the Demon and Banshee. Another star of the movie is the Sikorsky H-5 Dragonfly. But most importantly, life onboard the USS Oriskany is faithfully -although certainly a little smoothened...- described with numerous breathtaking scenes of aircraft landing on the aircraft carrier's wooden bridge. Many details are flabbergasting, such as the physical proximity of landing aircraft to parked ones, or the crude danger of flying in the Panther without ejection seat (the type was too early for having been equipped with it), the limited number of available tools and data for preparing and conducting a mission, the little protection US Navy pilots had when attacking a heavily defended ground target etc.For any military aviation enthusiast, for those seeking information on a rarely tackled war subject, this is a ""must-see"" movie that will come as a nice addition to any serious aviation movie collection",5,As close to actual naval operations as a movie can get!,1235692800,"02 27, 2009",2009,2080,"['1954', 'movie', 'story', 'few', 'F-9F', 'Panther', 'fighter-bomber', 'pilots', 'USS', 'CV-34', 'Oriskany', 'who', 'must', 'fly', 'perilous', 'mission', 'network', 'train', 'bridges', 'North', 'Korean', 'territory', 'eponymous', 'conflict', 'One', 'main', 'characters', 'mature', 'pilot', 'who', 'was', 'volunteered', 'serving', 'pilot', 'married', 'kids', 'successful', 'job', 'lawyer', 'back', 'US', 'What', 'gains', 'maturity', 'lost', 'self-control', 'final', 'demise', 'story', 'thus', 'simple', 'few', 'scenes', 'do', 'underline', 'fact', 'main', 'character', 'full', 'rich', 'private', 'life', 'movie', 'primarily', 'hard', 'life', 'sea-borne', 'military', 'aircraft', 'pilots', 'tough', 'unforgiving', 'Korean', 'conflict', 'story', 'would', 'not', 'award', '5-star', 'rating', 'movie.However', 'terms', 'documentary', 'rare', 'aircraft', 'operations', 'striking', 'gold', 'aviation', 'enthusiast', 'main', 'workhorse', 'Panther', 'used', 'conduct', 'unescorted', 'strike', 'missions', 'support', 'ground', 'troops', 'deep', 'Korean', 'territory', 'Beyond', 'aircraft', 'beginning', 'film', 'marred', 'footage', 'exotic', 'rare', 'aircraft', 'types', 'such', 'Demon', 'Banshee', 'star', 'movie', 'Sikorsky', 'H-5', 'Dragonfly', 'most', 'importantly', 'life', 'USS', 'Oriskany', 'faithfully', '-although', 'certainly', 'little', 'smoothened', 'described', 'numerous', 'breathtaking', 'scenes', 'aircraft', 'landing', 'aircraft', 'carrier', 'wooden', 'bridge', 'Many', 'details', 'are', 'flabbergasting', 'such', 'physical', 'proximity', 'landing', 'aircraft', 'parked', 'ones', 'crude', 'danger', 'flying', 'Panther', 'ejection', 'seat', 'type', 'was', 'too', 'early', 'having', 'been', 'equipped', 'limited', 'number', 'available', 'tools', 'data', 'preparing', 'conducting', 'mission', 'little', 'protection', 'US', 'Navy', 'pilots', 'had', 'when', 'attacking', 'heavily', 'defended', 'ground', 'target', 'military', 'aviation', 'enthusiast', 'seeking', 'information', 'rarely', 'tackled', 'war', 'subject', 'must-see', 'movie', 'will', 'come', 'nice', 'addition', 'serious', 'aviation', 'movie', 'collection']",N/A
