These images together with results of scientific investigations of polar ice caps, glaciers, and mountain glaciers, paint a vivid picture of the increasing rate of global ice melting compared to just one decade ago.The discoveries of the increased rates of mountain glacier declines, and the forming and draining of Greenlands surface ice melt lakes is alarming.I know that there are many people out there that believe that global warming is a hoax or a politicized issue, but scientific work, observations, and conclusions going back five decades are showing an increasingly clear picture of what is going on with the planet, and its climate.Ice is melting!  And, faster than it can form.Thanks for a fantastic glimpse into this important global historical event!5 stars!Alan Holyoak.

For me, this video gave me information that I kind of wish I didn't know.

It shows the actual melting of ice on both the northern and southern ends of our planet.  The people who made this film truly had courage.  There is an element of horror watching a man lower himself into a giant hole in the ice hundreds of feet deep.  The footage from Greenland was particularly disturbing,  showing how holes in the ice are now opening up inland as the ice melts and water pours from under the ice to the sea.
