1637845,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00BR1ZFC4,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[11, 14]","The cult oddity ""The Ghastly Love of Johnny X"" is one of those rare movies that I suspect will be a complete love-it or hate-it phenomenon.  Some will say the movie is a masterpiece of originality while others will decry it one of the worst movies ever made.  Just watch, I fully stand by this prediction!  For my taste, the movie is neither extreme.  This low budget endeavor is an obvious labor of love to its makers and cast, it has some genuinely memorable moments, but it never really comes together as strongly as you might hope.  I was really looking forward to ""The Ghastly Love of Johnny X"" because the idea really appealed to my oddball sensibilities.  I have been known to champion cult films of this type (Larry Blamire films, for example, come to mind, especially the sublimely silly The Trail of the Screaming Forehead).  Mixing science fiction with musicals with sixties era juvenile delinquents, there is certainly no lack of imagination in director Paul Bunnell's vision.  But the movie is wildly uneven and as much as I wanted to love it, it never fully connected with me.The movie starts off on a distant planet as Johnny Xavier (Will Keenan) stands trial for a seemingly bad attitude and general non-conformity.  Banished to Earth with his acolytes, we next see the group (the self-proclaimed Ghastlys) dolled up like extras in ""West Side Story"" and stomping through the desert in pursuit of Keenen's ex.  On the run, she (De Anna Joy Brooks plays Bliss) enters a desolate diner where she meets up with a innocent soda jerk (Les Williams) and a ruthless music promoter (Reggie Bannister).  When Johnny catches up with her, the movie kicks into a ambitious musical number that serves to introduce the characters more fully.  The plot, such as it is, involves a space suit that gives it owner great power.  Bliss has it, Johnny wants it.  A chase ensues.  Meanwhile, the music promoter enlists Johnny's assistance in staging a big concert with an aging music legend (Creed Bratton) and all of the principles will unite at this event.  From there, things change once again and the rest of the picture is ANOTHER chase across the desert.I just realized as I was writing this that I couldn't concisely make sense of the plot!  And maybe that's some of the problem, the movie feels somewhat unfocused as it covers a LOT of material.  As a parody of delinquent films from the 50's and 60's, the movie works.  As an homage to science fiction of the era, the results are a bit more sketchy.  As a musical, some numbers have their moments.  The only knock-out performance, in my opinion, is Bliss's drive-in seduction scene which caused me to laugh out loud frequently.  Adding Bannister and Bratton to the mix, the story gets increasingly convoluted.  Perhaps the most challenging aspect, though, is a lack of character focus.  Is Johnny X a real bad boy or just misunderstood?  The movie wants to have it both ways.Individual components of ""The Ghastly Love of Johnny X"" can be strong.  Kevin McCarthy and Paul William cameos are fun, Bratton (from TV's The Office) is amusing.  I loved De Anna Joy Brooks as Bliss.  But in the end, the many things that I liked about the movie never came together in a cohesive way.  I know what the movie wants to be, it just isn't as successful as I might have hoped.  Still, I'd recommend it to the right audience.  It's a small film just looking to be discovered by a faithful and rabid cult of followers.  But it definitely won't be embraced by everyone!

1637852,A14BPA6BKYORZG,B00BR1ZFC4,troyriser,"[2, 2]","This little film has taken a great deal of negative criticism both here and just about everywhere else, but I just don't have it in me to lambaste such an obvious labor of love. 'Ghastly' was made, I think, for at or around two million bucks, which is at the extreme low end of any feature film budget, whether meant for straight-for-DVD or theatrical distribution.  Yeah, I know: two million dollars is two million dollars, and a few really good movies (such as the Coen Brothers' first film 'Blood Simple') have been made for about that much or even less. The trick, I think, is that a low budget effort can't look like a low-budget effort, and this movie doesn't quite pull it off.  Why? Because musical numbers, for example, typically require innumerable takes to get it right, as I understand it, and I'm guessing the lack of funding for this project made just about every scene a one-take proposition, and it shows.So why do I like this movie, flawed as it is? Well, Reggie Bannister is in it, for one thing. I've loved watching Reggie Bannister work ever since the horror classic 'Phantasm' back in the 70's. For another thing, it was filmed in real-deal black and white using the last of the Kodak black and white film stock. I love old-school black and white. Done right, it's an incredibly visually pleasing experience, with a grayscale nuance that digitized cameras cannot seem to reproduce, and it seems the filmmakers in this instance tried very hard to get it right.Lastly, I loved the lead actress in this film, De Anna Joy Brooks, who played 'Bliss'.  I have never seen her in anything before and felt she brought an energy to the role which--in my view--made the movie worth watching until the end-credits rolled. If I see her name come up in anything else, I'm checking it out.
