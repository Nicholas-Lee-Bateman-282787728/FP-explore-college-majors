254838,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,630154028X,Andres C. Salama,"[0, 0]","According to many, The Mirror is Soviet filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky's best film. Certainly it is his most personal. It might look at first sight like a rambling series of confusing scenes, but the movie actually has a plot of sorts. The movie is reportedly based on Tarkovsky's own life. Basically we have a collection of vignettes (though in the film they are not shown chronologically). We have the protagonist as a boy (he is presumably based on Tarkovsky) living in a house with his mother (Margarita Terekhova in an intense performance) in the countryside before World War II, we see him later as a teenager training shooting with a rifle (with a stern instructor) presumably during the war, we see the absent father returning after World War II in soldier's uniform, we see the mother having a bad day in her job as proofreader in a printing house (that was actually Tarkovsky's mother real job), we see after the war how the boy has become a man (though he is never shown as an adult) and how he argues with his former wife (played also by Terekhova) about how to raise their troubled son called Ignat, we see a female doctor use hypnosis to try to cure Ignat's stuttering. Intercalated with these vignettes, we have documentary footage of the Spanish Civil War, of World War II, China's Cultural Revolution, the Chinese-Soviet border clashes during the late 1960. We also have surreal scenes of the mother levitating in the house, we have the child walking in the wintry countryside in a recreation of Brueghel's painting &#34;The Hunters in the Snow&#34;, we have the boy slowly perusing an art book. All to the music of Bach and Purcell and to poetry recitation by Tarkovksy's father Arseni.Many people have liked this film a lot, and I'm not denying Tarkovsky's seriousness or artistry, but I really wished that I would have like this movie more.

And the translation is very bothersome; I know no Russian, but it is obvious that a significant portion of the dialog is never translated.  We have to assume the skipped portions are unimportant to the story, but what a distraction.  This DVD takes what should be a 5 star experience for Tarkovsky fans, and turns it into 3 stars.I am fairly new to Tarkovsky:  I really love Stalker, one of my favorite movies of all time.  Solyaris is very good, although a bit depressing for my tastes.  Mirror I am more than willing to work with (and understanding it clearly requires work: other reviewers suggest doing some background reading combined with multiple viewings).

254842,A3N94LNED0IF0R,630154028X,Charles S. Tashiro,"[12, 17]","As with all work by the great Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky, &quot;The Mirror&quot; is an enigmatic, not quite describable film composed of finely honed imagery and evocative sounds that combine to produce an experience both delicate and overpowering at the same time. Tarkovsky's is among the most personal of personal filmmaking, in which each film seems a quest to re-invent the cinema over and over again. Rooted in the rhythms and routines of the everyday, his films are nonetheless the opposite of banal, finding in a glass of spilled milk or the movement of the wind through the trees an exquisite opening on to the transcendent.For such an uncompromising, original artist, every film is in a sense autobiographical, a record of his thoughts and feelings at the moment of filming. Yet in this, Tarkovsky's most explicitly autobiographical film (it is based on his childhood experiences during World War II), the results are relatively unsatisfying. There are still breathtakingly beautiful images, arresting sequences of inexplicable power, the same singular vision. What is surprising is how *fashionable* &quot;The Mirror&quot; is, and as a result, how dated. Made in the early 1970s, &quot;The Mirror&quot; indulges in many late 60s/early 70s mannerisms, including a non-linear narrative, stream-of-consciousness editing, dreams to explain the irrational and the use of newsreel footage as a kind of collective memory.While masterfully employed, these techniques are not really worthy of a director who has proven repeatedly his ability to move beyond fashion and create his own standards. Dependent on editing, these devices are also just a tad removed from Tarkovsky's basic skills. His best work flows with the coursing sparkle of the streams and puddles he loves to film. There are times in the &quot;The Mirror,&quot; on the other hand, when the cuts from one shot or scene to another are more forced than flowing, a touch too disconnected to compel as anything other than filmmaking necessity.&quot;The Mirror&quot; is nonetheless vividly textured, with an almost voracious response to light, shade and materials. (I have never seen a more effective use of the *grain* of film stock to enhance the tactile qualities of the image.) Like &quot;Solaris,&quot; it makes a good introduction to Tarkovksy's work for viewers who might be a little put off by his more uncompromising efforts. Which is to say that in addition to dating the film, &quot;The Mirror's&quot; stylishness works to smooth over some of the director's rough edges. Viewers already familiar with Tarkovsky's cinema will not be seriously disappointed, perhaps just a little surprised, as I was, that he too could succumb to the momentarily fashionable.",4,Pleasures of the Ineffable,1007510400,"12 5, 2001",2001,2737,"['work', 'great', 'Russian', 'filmmaker', 'Andrei', 'Tarkovsky', 'quot', 'Mirror', 'quot', 'enigmatic', 'not', 'quite', 'describable', 'film', 'composed', 'finely', 'honed', 'imagery', 'evocative', 'sounds', 'combine', 'produce', 'experience', 'delicate', 'overpowering', 'same', 'time', 'Tarkovsky', 'most', 'personal', 'personal', 'filmmaking', 'film', 'quest', 're-invent', 'cinema', 'over', 'again', 'Rooted', 'rhythms', 'routines', 'everyday', 'films', 'are', 'nonetheless', 'opposite', 'banal', 'finding', 'glass', 'spilled', 'milk', 'movement', 'wind', 'trees', 'exquisite', 'opening', 'transcendent.For', 'such', 'uncompromising', 'original', 'artist', 'film', 'sense', 'autobiographical', 'record', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'moment', 'filming', 'Tarkovsky', 'most', 'explicitly', 'autobiographical', 'film', 'based', 'childhood', 'experiences', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'results', 'are', 'relatively', 'unsatisfying', 'are', 'still', 'breathtakingly', 'beautiful', 'images', 'arresting', 'sequences', 'inexplicable', 'power', 'same', 'singular', 'vision', 'What', 'surprising', 'how', '*fashionable*', 'quot', 'Mirror', 'quot', 'result', 'how', 'dated', 'Made', 'early', '1970s', 'quot', 'Mirror', 'quot', 'indulges', 'many', 'late', '60s/early', '70s', 'mannerisms', 'including', 'non-linear', 'narrative', 'stream-of-consciousness', 'editing', 'explain', 'irrational', 'use', 'newsreel', 'footage', 'kind', 'collective', 'memory.While', 'masterfully', 'employed', 'techniques', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'worthy', 'director', 'who', 'proven', 'repeatedly', 'ability', 'move', 'fashion', 'create', 'own', 'standards', 'Dependent', 'editing', 'devices', 'are', 'also', 'just', 'tad', 'removed', 'Tarkovsky', 'basic', 'skills', 'best', 'work', 'coursing', 'sparkle', 'streams', 'puddles', 'film', 'are', 'times', 'quot', 'Mirror', 'quot', 'other', 'hand', 'when', 'cuts', 'one', 'shot', 'scene', 'are', 'more', 'forced', 'flowing', 'touch', 'too', 'disconnected', 'compel', 'anything', 'other', 'filmmaking', 'necessity.', 'quot', 'Mirror', 'quot', 'nonetheless', 'vividly', 'textured', 'almost', 'voracious', 'response', 'light', 'shade', 'materials', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'more', 'effective', 'use', '*grain*', 'film', 'stock', 'enhance', 'tactile', 'qualities', 'image', 'quot', 'Solaris', 'quot', 'good', 'introduction', 'Tarkovksy', 'work', 'viewers', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'put', 'off', 'more', 'uncompromising', 'efforts', 'Which', 'say', 'addition', 'dating', 'film', 'quot', 'Mirror', 'quot', 'smooth', 'director', 'rough', 'edges', 'Viewers', 'already', 'familiar', 'Tarkovsky', 'cinema', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'seriously', 'disappointed', 'perhaps', 'just', 'little', 'surprised', 'was', 'too', 'could', 'succumb', 'momentarily', 'fashionable']",The Mirror VHS
254843,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,630154028X,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[5, 6]","The film, although it received mixed critical reviews, was obviously thought of highly enough by Soviet authorities because, after initially not wanting to release it, they did, but refused its entry into film festivals like Venice of Cannes, for fear that it would win, and thus draw more attention to Tarkovsky's non-agitprop works. The irony is that, had Tarkovsky, and other artists, been allowed to pursue their art unfettered, it would have reflected all the greater on the Soviet system. Having seen earlier and later films of his, I can say that The Mirror is likely Tarkovsky's best film- not a perfect film, but a great film, and easily. Earlier works culminated in this, while later works stole from it. Tarkovsky, himself, wrote this, in his memoirs: `(the film) has demonstrated to me, again, how well founded my conjecture about the importance of personally experienced emotion was in telling a story onscreen. Perhaps cinema is the most personal art, the most intimate. In cinema only the author's intimate truth will be convincing enough for the audience to accept.' In actuality, cinema is second, in that regard, to poetry; but then cinema is closer to poetry than any other art in giving its creator an almost God-like ability over time and space. However, its visual element does make it more accessible to many than poetry; if not more intimate.The biggest critical boner about the film, however, seems to be the idea that the lead character, Alexei, dies in the film, or that the film is about his death, in either memory or toto. Yet, this simply is not a sustainable claim because, as mentioned earlier, the scene in which Alexei supposedly `dies,' is done in a blackly comic sort of way- with two old babushkas kvetching about Alexei possibly dying, even though he may only have strep throat. Yet, by virtue of the images of his memory we have seen to that point, Alexei clearly embellishes to a point of heightened reality, in the least, and melodrama, at most. Therefore, if he is the source of the claim of impending death, it is suspect. Clearly the two babushkas are not credible sources since they seem puzzled by the claim. The so-called doctor in the scene seems not too concerned, either. Likely, Alexei is hypochondriacal. The other pillar for the claim of death is when we see Alexei grip and release a small bird upward in the air. First, the image is so trite, and obviously so, that Tarkovsky, if this was his intent, made an error in judgment that is very bad, for it thuds the film flat. Instead, given the absurdity of the scene, this is likelier Alexei's own melodramatic tendencies coming to the fore again, and him trying to paint an end to the scene, not his life, for Alexei does, at times in the film, seem to break the fourth wall in his recall. Also, the bird does not fly free from Alexei's dead hand. His hand heaves up and releases the bird. It's a toss- a thing that would not occur in a last gesture. Given these visual certainties, the far likelier scenario is that, perhaps, this may be the present state of the film, with Alexei `s memory the rest of the film to that point. The end, with his mother's learning of her pregnancy with him, is just Andrei's exclamation point after the melodrama with the bird. Or, as I stated earlier, the whole film may be a flashforth with a return to the present of his mother at the `start' of his life.On the flip side, there are several good scenes that stand out narratively and have other import. The best is the dig at Stalinism and censorship when we see Alexei's mom freaking out over a possible typographical error at her job. She clearly fears staining her record, and the consequences that may bring. That this worry is compounded by the overt aggression of her co-worker makes for a scene where personal and professional ills collide convincingly, and the scene ends in a shower, where she relieves her stress by laughing. During the dummy grenade scene, when the drill instructor pounces on the grenade, we see his fear reflected in the pulses of his forehead where skull has clearly been removed- likely in a shrapnel explosion. It is eerie, realistic, and memorable. There is a scene where we see spilt milk and the odd coalescence of milk on a floor, or in the scene where Ignat reads Pushkin's letter aloud, then returns after opening the door, to find her gone. It seems a dream, except we see a moist condensation stain that evaporates on the wooden table, suggesting it was `real.' This scene prefigures similar scenes of ghosts in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, just five years later.But, then, in a sense, Alexei may or may not be a ghost- a possible person, or a past person. Certainly he embodies his nation, and the film is not wholly from his point of view. There are scenes, such as parts of the dummy grenade scene or when his mother frets over a possible typo, that simply cannot have been known by Alexei, unless he is more than just a human character- perhaps an amalgam of persons and idea(l)s absorbed by his surroundings. After all, early on the doctor tells his mother that some believe that plants have senses of perception. Similarly, some of the newsreels used in the film make no sense, as they are, nor in the context of the film, until one considers that not all memories make sense. Things rarely make sense in a fugue, anyway, and that's what The Mirror is- a visual fugue on thought and memory, and a great one. Compare it to any of David Lynch's similarly posited films, and Tarkovsky's film's superiority is manifest, for Lynch's films are piffle, in contrast. From literary references (Chekhov's Ward No. 6) to historical context to self-referentiality (a scene where a film poster of Tarkovsky's own Andrei Rublev hangs) to visual sleight of hand to characterization by accumulation, The Mirror succeeds as a great film by simultaneously being as large as everything while focusing on the trivia of life that one rarely recalls. Yet, the film never bores, it invites rewatch to re-trigger memories of it and one's own. Rare is the trigger that is also a bullet.

I actually watched the entire movie again the next night.  What I discovered was a beautifully and poetically created masterpiece that discards the narrative structure in place of disjointed memories and images.  The film is more like a painting in that to understand it each portion of the canvass must be mulled over and revisited to get the true impact.The images in this film are absolutely stunning and unforgetable; the burning barn, milk dripping from an overturned glass...It may go without saying but this film is for those interested in film as art and not film as blockbuster entertainment.

254846,A35AMPDFAB8JLT,630154028X,Edmonson,"[2, 2]","Tarkovsky's ""The Mirror""(1975) is more like a visual poem than a narrative story. Images jump forward and backward in time depicting thoughts and emotions of Alexei (Ignat Daniltsev) from childhood, and as an adult, from prewar to postwar. This is largely an autobiographical film that references back to Tarkovsky's childhood. Poetry written and spoken by Tarkovsky's father is intermingled with scenes. Mirrors are constantly being used. Sometimes mirrors are used like windows into the future. In one scene Alexei's mother, Maria (Margarita Terekhova), is looking into a mirror and sees an old woman (herself in the future). This scene then transitions into the old woman's present time. There are some instances like this in the film where one is reminded of scenes from Stanely Kubrick's film ""2001"" (1968) where one leaps forward in time or seems to be looking into the future. This film depicts the gaze as a reflection of the world of memories divorced from time, and so the mirror, the reflection of self, can be seen as a metaphor of the ephemeral, and as a window into memory and dreams.This film is in 1.33:1 aspect ratio and has not been remastered. It has color and black and white sequences. The audio is Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo in Russian with English subtitles. This film was originally filmed in mono.

254847,A2BPDFR58H9575,630154028X,Galina,"[16, 17]","I just finished watching it. It's been several years since I saw it last time. I worried that I may not like it as much as I used to...I should not have worried - I love it even more now if that is at all possible. I've seen it at different times of my life - first, as a college student many years ago in Moscow; I keep returning to it all my life.When Tarkovsky's Zerkalo (The Mirror) was first released, it divided the audience completely. I remember how my friends were passionately discussing it. One girl was complaining that she did not understand anything; the movie was confusing for her, dark, disturbing, the children characters - sad, pale, poorly dressed. I remember her asking, ""Why did they show a boy in the opening scene that had an awful stutter, and they never showed that boy again? What did it mean when the dying man in bed was setting a bird free? How did he get the bird on the first place?"" Another friend of mine, a guy, tried to explain the things to her. He suggested that she thought about the times Zerkalo was showing, he tried to explain to her Tarkovsky's symbolism where the bird could be representing life and soul of the main character and the boy with the stutter could mean that it was most difficult for people to communicate and understand each other.I only listened to their argument and did not participate because I had not seen the film yet. When it finally happened, Andrei Arsenievich Tarkovsky was presented at the screening and he talked to the audience before the show. I remember him repeating over and over that there were no tricks, no puzzles, and no tongue-in-cheeks in the film; that every symbol, image, dialog, and sound was there because they belonged there. He asked us if we had questions. Someone from the audience suggested that we saw the film first, and then, asked questions. Tarkovsky replied that from his experience, not many viewers would sit through the film and who ever would, usually leave in silence, not asking anything. And then he told us a story. After Zerkalo was completed, it was first shown to the group of the famous critics. After watching it, critics started to argue about it, trying to find the hidden meaning and make sense of what they just saw. It went on and on until the cleaning lady who came to the screening room and had been waiting for the end of discussion to do her job, asked them for how long they would stay? Someone said to her that they were discussing a very complicated film, and they needed time to understand it. Cleaning lady asked, ""What is that you do not understand in this film? I saw it also, and I understood everything."" Critics were silenced for a moment, and then, one of them asked the woman to share her thoughts on Zerkalo. She answered, ""It is about a man who had caused too much pain to the ones whom he loved and who loved him. Now he is dying and he is trying to ask them for forgiveness but he does not know how."" After the pause Tarkovsky said that he had nothing else to add about his film to what the cleaning lady had to say.I never understood complains that Zerkalo is a very confusing, difficult, and dark film. No, it is clear and deep as a mirror. Every time you look at the mirror, it will show you new depth and reflections. Past, presence, future, memory, love, guilt, forgiveness, beauty, sadness, nostalgia, and sacrifice - the mirror reflects it all -just watch closely.My verdict - The Best Film ever made, the top of my list (tie with Andrei Rublyov).",5,It is all in the mirror,1150416000,"06 16, 2006",2006,3493,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'been', 'several', 'years', 'saw', 'last', 'time', 'worried', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'as', 'much', 'used', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'worried', 'love', 'even', 'more', 'now', 'possible', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'different', 'times', 'life', 'first', 'college', 'student', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'Moscow', 'keep', 'returning', 'life.When', 'Tarkovsky', 'Zerkalo', 'Mirror', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'divided', 'audience', 'completely', 'remember', 'how', 'friends', 'were', 'passionately', 'discussing', 'One', 'girl', 'was', 'complaining', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'anything', 'movie', 'was', 'confusing', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'children', 'characters', 'sad', 'pale', 'poorly', 'dressed', 'remember', 'asking', 'Why', 'did', 'show', 'boy', 'opening', 'scene', 'had', 'awful', 'stutter', 'never', 'showed', 'boy', 'again', 'What', 'did', 'mean', 'when', 'dying', 'man', 'bed', 'was', 'setting', 'bird', 'free', 'How', 'did', 'get', 'bird', 'first', 'place', 'friend', 'mine', 'guy', 'tried', 'explain', 'things', 'suggested', 'thought', 'times', 'Zerkalo', 'was', 'showing', 'tried', 'explain', 'Tarkovsky', 'symbolism', 'where', 'bird', 'could', 'be', 'representing', 'life', 'soul', 'main', 'character', 'boy', 'stutter', 'could', 'mean', 'was', 'most', 'difficult', 'people', 'communicate', 'understand', 'other.I', 'only', 'listened', 'argument', 'did', 'not', 'participate', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'yet', 'When', 'finally', 'happened', 'Andrei', 'Arsenievich', 'Tarkovsky', 'was', 'presented', 'screening', 'talked', 'audience', 'show', 'remember', 'repeating', 'were', 'tricks', 'puzzles', 'tongue-in-cheeks', 'film', 'symbol', 'image', 'dialog', 'sound', 'was', 'there', 'belonged', 'there', 'asked', 'had', 'questions', 'Someone', 'audience', 'suggested', 'saw', 'film', 'first', 'then', 'asked', 'questions', 'Tarkovsky', 'replied', 'experience', 'not', 'many', 'viewers', 'would', 'sit', 'film', 'who', 'ever', 'would', 'usually', 'leave', 'silence', 'not', 'asking', 'anything', 'then', 'told', 'story', 'Zerkalo', 'was', 'completed', 'was', 'first', 'shown', 'group', 'famous', 'critics', 'watching', 'critics', 'started', 'argue', 'trying', 'find', 'hidden', 'meaning', 'make', 'sense', 'what', 'just', 'saw', 'went', 'cleaning', 'lady', 'who', 'came', 'screening', 'room', 'had', 'been', 'waiting', 'end', 'discussion', 'do', 'job', 'asked', 'how', 'long', 'would', 'stay', 'Someone', 'said', 'were', 'discussing', 'very', 'complicated', 'film', 'needed', 'time', 'understand', 'Cleaning', 'lady', 'asked', 'What', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'film', 'saw', 'also', 'understood', 'everything', 'Critics', 'were', 'silenced', 'moment', 'then', 'one', 'asked', 'woman', 'share', 'thoughts', 'Zerkalo', 'answered', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'caused', 'too', 'much', 'pain', 'ones', 'whom', 'loved', 'who', 'loved', 'Now', 'dying', 'trying', 'ask', 'forgiveness', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'pause', 'Tarkovsky', 'said', 'had', 'nothing', 'else', 'add', 'film', 'what', 'cleaning', 'lady', 'had', 'say.I', 'never', 'understood', 'complains', 'Zerkalo', 'very', 'confusing', 'difficult', 'dark', 'film', 'No', 'clear', 'deep', 'mirror', 'time', 'look', 'mirror', 'will', 'show', 'new', 'depth', 'reflections', 'Past', 'presence', 'future', 'memory', 'love', 'guilt', 'forgiveness', 'beauty', 'sadness', 'nostalgia', 'sacrifice', 'mirror', '-just', 'watch', 'closely.My', 'verdict', 'Best', 'Film', 'ever', 'made', 'top', 'list', 'tie', 'Andrei', 'Rublyov']",The Mirror VHS

254851,A2CV19XK9VI136,630154028X,"""hakob""","[69, 72]","Andrei Tarkovsky's THE MIRROR (1974) is his most personal and artistically daring film--and to me, ultimately his most moving.A semi-autobiographical work, it interweaves poems, dramatic scenes, dreams  and newsreels to evoke the inner symbolic world of the protagonist, his  nostalgia for the past and his troubled relationships with his wife and  mother in the present. At the same time it is a meditation on the nature of  Russia, from the nation's role as mediator between the East and West to  specific historical events such as the Stalinist purges of the mid-to-late  1930s and World War II. Indeed, few works of art say more about the Russian  people with such economy.The cinematography, by Georgii Rerberg, is so  richly detailed that it frequently takes your breath away. Many of the  shots are deliberately reminiscent of paintings by Breughel and Leonardo da  Vinci. The soundtrack is equally beautiful, layered with natural sounds,  electronic music, classical music (by composers such as Bach and Pergolesi)  and poems (written and recited by the director's father Arsenii Tarkovsky,  a noted Russian poet).The film undoubtedly benefits from its superb  cast, which includes many popular and highly respected Russian actors. The  voice of the Narrator is played by Innokenty Smoktunovsky; Margarita  Terekhova plays both the Mother and the Wife. Other actors make indelible  impressions in smaller roles: Anatoly Solonitsyn (the Doctor),  Oleg  Yankovsky (the Father), Alla Demidova and Nikolai Grinko (the mother's  colleagues at the printing factory). For those who speak Russian, it's a  pleasure just to hear their finely tuned dialogue.Although the film was  widely criticized for being too difficult to follow, it was also praised by  many Russian critics for capturing the spirit of an entire generation. It  may not be to the taste of everyone, since it is constructed more like a  poem than a conventional film narrative. However, for those who are willing  to make the leap of faith, it is uniquely rewarding.Kino on Video's new  DVD looks absolutely stunning. Having seen the film a number of times in  various less-than-ideal incarnations on video, I was impressed at the way  the DVD captures the richness of the film's cinemtography. The film is  above all a sensuous experience, so every extra bit of detail in the image  and sound helps add to its overall emotional impact. Kino has used the same  transfer for their new VHS edition, but the DVD is clearly preferable and  it's the same price. It doesn't have any special features, unlike Kino's  new release of Tarkovky's THE SACRIFICE, which includes a making-of  documentary. However, it's hard to complain when the film itself and the  video transfer are so satisfying. In summation, I can hardly recommend this  particular title more highly.",5,An absolute must-have!,952819200,"03 12, 2000",2000,2827,"['Andrei', 'Tarkovsky', 'THE', 'MIRROR', '1974', 'most', 'personal', 'artistically', 'daring', 'film', 'ultimately', 'most', 'moving.A', 'semi-autobiographical', 'work', 'poems', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'dreams', 'newsreels', 'evoke', 'inner', 'symbolic', 'world', 'protagonist', 'nostalgia', 'past', 'troubled', 'relationships', 'wife', 'mother', 'present', 'same', 'time', 'meditation', 'nature', 'Russia', 'nation', 'role', 'mediator', 'East', 'West', 'specific', 'historical', 'events', 'such', 'Stalinist', 'purges', 'mid-to-late', '1930s', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Indeed', 'few', 'works', 'art', 'say', 'more', 'Russian', 'people', 'such', 'economy.The', 'cinematography', 'Georgii', 'Rerberg', 'so', 'richly', 'detailed', 'frequently', 'breath', 'away', 'Many', 'shots', 'are', 'deliberately', 'reminiscent', 'paintings', 'Breughel', 'Leonardo', 'da', 'Vinci', 'soundtrack', 'equally', 'beautiful', 'layered', 'natural', 'sounds', 'electronic', 'music', 'classical', 'music', 'composers', 'such', 'Bach', 'Pergolesi', 'written', 'recited', 'director', 'father', 'Arsenii', 'Tarkovsky', 'noted', 'Russian', 'poet', '.The', 'film', 'undoubtedly', 'benefits', 'superb', 'cast', 'many', 'popular', 'highly', 'respected', 'Russian', 'actors', 'voice', 'Narrator', 'played', 'Innokenty', 'Smoktunovsky', 'Margarita', 'Terekhova', 'Mother', 'Wife', 'Other', 'actors', 'make', 'indelible', 'impressions', 'smaller', 'roles', 'Anatoly', 'Solonitsyn', 'Doctor', 'Oleg', 'Yankovsky', 'Father', 'Alla', 'Demidova', 'Nikolai', 'Grinko', 'mother', 'colleagues', 'printing', 'factory', 'who', 'speak', 'Russian', 'pleasure', 'just', 'hear', 'finely', 'tuned', 'film', 'was', 'widely', 'criticized', 'being', 'too', 'difficult', 'follow', 'was', 'also', 'praised', 'many', 'Russian', 'critics', 'capturing', 'spirit', 'entire', 'generation', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'taste', 'everyone', 'constructed', 'more', 'poem', 'conventional', 'film', 'narrative', 'However', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'make', 'leap', 'faith', 'uniquely', 'rewarding.Kino', 'Video', 'new', 'DVD', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'Having', 'seen', 'film', 'number', 'times', 'various', 'less-than-ideal', 'incarnations', 'video', 'was', 'impressed', 'way', 'DVD', 'richness', 'film', 'cinemtography', 'film', 'sensuous', 'experience', 'so', 'extra', 'bit', 'detail', 'image', 'sound', 'add', 'overall', 'emotional', 'impact', 'Kino', 'used', 'same', 'transfer', 'new', 'VHS', 'edition', 'DVD', 'clearly', 'preferable', 'same', 'price', ""n't"", 'have', 'special', 'features', 'Kino', 'new', 'release', 'Tarkovky', 'THE', 'SACRIFICE', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'However', 'hard', 'complain', 'when', 'film', 'video', 'transfer', 'are', 'so', 'satisfying', 'summation', 'can', 'hardly', 'recommend', 'particular', 'title', 'more', 'highly']",The Mirror VHS

Steffen ""jsteffe25""","[10, 11]","I have three versions of the film on DVD now--the Kino, the Ruscico, and the Russian Krupny Plan version (without subtitles).Kino's transfer is not bad considering its age; my main critique is that the color balance is overly cool. The RUSCICO edition looks better in some respects but the print is slightly pinkish and some of the scenes are transfered overly bright, as Vlad, another reviewer, has noted.I agree that Kino's subtitles are frustratingly incomplete in several dialogue scenes. It's a pity, because there are many wonderful small exchanges between the characters that really add texture to the script. The RUSCICO subtitles are more complete but they terribly botch the poetry, which is central to the film's effect.

254855,A2DEB4K5G9X21C,630154028X,Le_Samourai,"[3, 3]","Mirror is Andrei Tarkovsky's visually transcendent, artistically revelatory autobiographical film on lost innocence and emotional abandonment. Presented as a languidly paced, achronological cinematic montage of modern day life, personal memories, historical news footage, and dreams, Mirror is an introspective journey through the course of human existence, hope and despair, success and frailty: a television broadcast of a young man seemingly cured from stuttering through hypnosis; a neglected wife (Margarita Terekhova) humoring a village doctor who has lost his way; a custodial argument between a faceless narrator (Innokenty Smoktunovsky) and his ex-wife; a precocious young man trying the patience of his military instructor (Yuri Nazarov). To attempt to conform these images into some coherent plot or universal conclusion is meaningless. After all, Mirror is a reflection of Tarkovsky's haunted soul: his search for spirituality, connection, Truth - exposed through indelible images that inevitably define our own imperfect lives, however trivial or mundane.Andrei Tarkovsky deliberately obscures time by using the same actors to portray the two phases of the narrator's life: the fatherless boy attempting to reach out to his distracted mother, and the distant father unable to relate to his self-absorbed son. Anachronistic newsreels of world events are interspersed to provide environmental reference and tonal shift. The structure of the film constantly evolves through the use of flashbacks and flash forwards, defined through chromatic shifts. This results in a film that is thematically cyclical, reflecting the narrator's pattern of alienation and emotional isolation. The absence of logical order in the film elicits a visceral reaction from the audience: the knowledge that we have experienced truth in all its intoxicating beauty and desperate longing... and perhaps even a brief connection with the artist himself.",5,Another fantastically beautiful Tarkovsky masterpiece,1262822400,"01 7, 2010",2010,1936,"['Mirror', 'Andrei', 'Tarkovsky', 'visually', 'transcendent', 'artistically', 'revelatory', 'autobiographical', 'film', 'lost', 'innocence', 'emotional', 'abandonment', 'Presented', 'languidly', 'paced', 'achronological', 'cinematic', 'montage', 'modern', 'day', 'life', 'personal', 'memories', 'historical', 'news', 'footage', 'dreams', 'Mirror', 'introspective', 'journey', 'course', 'human', 'existence', 'hope', 'despair', 'success', 'frailty', 'television', 'broadcast', 'young', 'man', 'seemingly', 'cured', 'stuttering', 'hypnosis', 'neglected', 'wife', 'Margarita', 'Terekhova', 'humoring', 'village', 'doctor', 'who', 'lost', 'way', 'custodial', 'argument', 'faceless', 'narrator', 'Innokenty', 'Smoktunovsky', 'ex-wife', 'precocious', 'young', 'man', 'trying', 'patience', 'military', 'instructor', 'Yuri', 'Nazarov', 'attempt', 'conform', 'images', 'coherent', 'plot', 'universal', 'conclusion', 'meaningless', 'Mirror', 'reflection', 'Tarkovsky', 'haunted', 'soul', 'search', 'spirituality', 'connection', 'Truth', 'exposed', 'indelible', 'images', 'inevitably', 'define', 'own', 'imperfect', 'lives', 'however', 'trivial', 'mundane.Andrei', 'Tarkovsky', 'deliberately', 'time', 'using', 'same', 'actors', 'portray', 'two', 'phases', 'narrator', 'life', 'fatherless', 'boy', 'attempting', 'reach', 'out', 'distracted', 'mother', 'distant', 'father', 'unable', 'relate', 'self-absorbed', 'son', 'Anachronistic', 'newsreels', 'world', 'events', 'are', 'interspersed', 'provide', 'environmental', 'reference', 'tonal', 'shift', 'structure', 'film', 'constantly', 'use', 'flashbacks', 'flash', 'forwards', 'defined', 'chromatic', 'shifts', 'results', 'film', 'thematically', 'cyclical', 'reflecting', 'narrator', 'pattern', 'alienation', 'emotional', 'isolation', 'absence', 'logical', 'order', 'film', 'visceral', 'reaction', 'audience', 'knowledge', 'have', 'experienced', 'truth', 'intoxicating', 'beauty', 'desperate', 'longing', 'perhaps', 'even', 'brief', 'connection', 'artist']",The Mirror VHS
254856,A3CSDBDV77Z0VI,630154028X,lily t.,"[1, 1]","Ignat, the narrator's son says : Electricity, It's like it's all happening before but I haven't been here before.Interpretive Spoilers:Mirror: our lives mirror those which have gone before us. In this case the narrator, Alyosha, divorced from his wife Nataliya, whose son Ignat is growing up without him and is developing problems, repeats the tragedy he suffered - growing up without a father. However, the whole film reads as a tone poem dedicated to the [often widowed] women of his mother, Maria's, generation, and to the children whose families were broken up by the wars  of the 20th century. Viewed from that perspective all the imagery falls into place and is linked.In the first scene solitary Maria smokes, looking out onto the landscape. A charming doctor, passing,  flirts with her, but she is unmoved. Where is her husband? Has he been taken in the purges, why are they separated? We don't know yet. A nearby house burns as she and her children watch. We then segue into a beautiful and disturbing dream; a call from the irritating old mother to the grown narrator, and a scene from the 1930's during Stalin's reign of terror , where Maria is terrified of having made an editorial mistake in the publishing house where she works. We discover her husband has left her.We then move to friends of Nataliya and the narrator, a Spanish/ Russian family , and their memories of the Spanish Civil War- between the forces of fascism and communism. However, more than that, the Spaniard speaks of the separation of father and son, and we see newsreel footage of children being taken from their families [ evacuated?] --they are so helpless, so little and so alone.Now  we see a balloon in flight--then a book of Leonardo Da Vinci's drawings-- the man who invented many such flying machines as well as weaponry, which Ignat , the narrator's son, is leafing through. We notice Leonardo's Madonnas  look very much like Maria/Nataliya.Ignat, says to his mother who is in a rush to go somewhere and spills the contents of her handbag : Electricity, It's like its all happening before but I haven't been here before.He's alone in an apartment  waiting for his grandmother but doesn't recognize her when she comes to the door/ neither does she him. The apartment becomes much grander and a lady beckons Ignat to read a letter from Pushkin where Russia's separation from Europe is discussed.  The phone rings, the narrator is calling, knowing his son is alone. He asks do you have friends? [ this scene will be linked later to one where the narrator is sitting in an izba while his mother sells her jewels for a chicken where he understands he is a solitary being] When I was your age I loved a red-headed girl etc.The memory of the redheaded girl is the transition to a wartime scene, where sharp shooting is being practiced [ this was a national pastime, a skill then utilized when the youth, including girls, were formed into squads of snipers deployed against the Germans]. The instructor dresses down a boy, only to learn his parents have been killed in the siege of Leningrad[ 22- 25 million dead in WWII and many children left orphaned] . We see terrible footage of the war--and Pushkin's letter about Russia's destiny is recalled--for Europeans [Germans] Russians will always be the other, subhuman, Asiatics,  but now comes the absent father's poetry that is imbued with spirituality: Fear not Death, not at 17 or at 70, we are all immortal, and there is only light.  There's a line there that says something about the house that won't crumble, meaning though the country is under siege it will hold up --but the house in the beginning burned and the family was separated.How should things be? The orphaned boy is sledding in a scene straight out of Bruegel -- yet we see the dead body of Hitler, the bomb thrown on Hiroshima, the Chinese Revolution, the break between the Chinese and Russians--endless turmoil and violence. We return  to Leonardo's lady who looks like Maria, and Father coming home from on leave the war to visit the children.We are again in the present where Ignat is troubled, used as a pawn against his mother by the narrator who torments and humiliates Nataliya, and analyzes how they've grown bourgeois [ perhaps that is why his grandmother doesn't recognize him, or perhaps because she has seen him so little] until they see Ignat has started a fire in the courtyard.Now the narrator dreams of the 1930's again when everything was ahead of him, before he was damaged and before he damaged others. The world was still whole--the family was intact.  There is beautiful imagery of that wholeness, of the rain, the forest, the wind, and then a jarring memory of their wartime exile without a father in the country: mother and the last of their potatoes.She decides to sell her jewels for a chicken. When she gets to the woman's house where she will trade--she spills everything she is carrying on the floor--a link with the earlier electricity scene. The narrator Alyosha, who is with her,  is in tatters, he is ill, he is barefoot and  hungry--and yet she cannot bear the death of the chicken and runs away. While he  waits for her he looks into a mirror and realizes his terrible solitude, noticing an excess of milk spilling over, and the woman, who has a husband to do for her, wearing silk, and  her fat well fed child sleeping amidst starched white sheets.And now he understands who his mother is, and sees her with her handsome husband, whom she never stops grieving for , who is gone, whom she dreams of, and when she is ill, and in her illness floats above the bed, whose voice she hears speaking tenderly as if he loved and cared for her.Then Alyosha walks through lace curtains to the time before the war, to the time before his birth when his mother and father are lying in a field and father asks her if she is hoping for a boy or a girl--but in her happiness she grows sad--because she sees her terrible solitary future and herself growing old, left alone with the children.So we come full circle. Is the narrator dying  as some say? Or is he going to recover from his soul sickness; and in freeing the captive bird,  free himself of his  inability to communicate-just as the stuttering young boy in the first scene was freed.",5,It's

To recount things like a fantastic cast or a riveting camera-work feels trivial--these are givens when dealing with Tarkovsky. The magic lies elsewhere. Tarkovsky called his film-making sculpting in time and this phrase suits The Mirror perfectly. The richness of its imagery is reminiscent of that other great sculptor in time--Marcel Proust. Watching The Mirror feels very different from reading Proust, but Tarkovsky has that unparalleled understanding of memory that Proust has in literature. The film is not surreal or strange or difficult to watch; to the contrary, it feels bewitchingly light and liquid. It does not look as a dream or a flashback, but memories never do--although they are often represented as such on the silver screen. And yet Tarkovsky's luxurious pacing and exquisite framing are also dream-like in their haunting beauty and power of absorption. In The Mirror, as in The Remembrance of Things Past, memories are not representations of reality; they are reality. Watching the film feels as if someone caught your memory in a mirror and reflected it back. What you see is at once both personal and social--a view into your innermost emotions as well as their historical fabric. Its realism lies not in the specific events it portrays but in the structure of feeling it captures. Every Tarkovsky film has left me somewhere between a shock and a trance, totally dumbfounded that a film can be like this, and none more than The Mirror.

254860,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,630154028X,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[3, 3]","Tarkovsky's fourth feature length film was also his most overtly personal project, in which he creates a kind of mirror of his own life: growing up in Russia during WWII, raised largely by his mother with a distant father, going through divorce.  It is a kind of collage of images, depicting the life of a child who becomes an unseen narrator, whose life becomes a kind of repetition of the life of his father, and whose mother is played by the same actress who ends up playing his estranged wife.  The past blends with the present; documentary footage of life during wartime blends with lifelike recreations; dreamlike sequences blend with depictions of harsh realities.  It is an intriguing film - almost unprecedented in its experimental approach to autobiography.  Perhaps the closest parallel in cinema is with the films of Chris Marker, notablySans Soleil, in which highly personal reflections, displaced onto a fictional narrator and accompanied by richly evocative imagery, are elevated into reflections on time and memory and culture that transcend their semi-autobiographical locus.  The film's images will resonate profoundly with those who have seen Tarkovsky's other works.  Essential viewing for those who appreciate the work of Tarkovsky - even if it is probably not the best introduction to his work - and highly recommended for lovers of inventive approaches to cinema, or to those interested in Russian culture and history.It's hard to know what to say about this dvd transfer; I've seen the film projected from an old print more than a decade ago and as far as I recall this version looks better than that.  I'm happy to have it available on dvd at all, and can say that the power of the film does come across in Kino's version.

254861,ANM2SCEUL3WL1,630154028X,Pristine,"[3, 4]","I know there are websites devoted to comparing different transfers of Tarkovsky's movies.  The age-old Kino vs. R.U.S.C.I.C.O..  They both have their pluses and minuses.  There is first, the difference in color.  Kino (this edition) is more saturated, but the audio track has a tin-can reverb to it, delaying it almost to the point where the music doesn't match.  And then there is the matter of translation.I consider myself a huge fan of Andrei Tarkovski's work.  I own both versions, and had to obtain it long before Amazon even carried it.  (They are the same editions though).  I am reminded of an old scratchy King Pleasure record I own.  It's been played for so many years, you could hear every scratch, pop, and click on it.  But it doesn't take away the least bit from the enjoyment.  Why?  Because IT IS THE QUALITY OF THE WORK THAT COUNTS, not the quality of the media.I have seen this movie on the big screen at Lincoln Center in New York City recently, carefully restored with corrected translation.  I came home and watched both my copies the next day to compare.  In my opinion, as a non-Russian speaker (but a graduated English major), the minor discrepancies and lack of transfer DOES NOT outweigh the fantastic quality of film-making presented here.Tarkovsky is one of the recent Russian film greats, and this movie is seen by many as the apex of his creativity.  Last time I checked, film is more than mere images.  It is audio, visual, script, angles, color combined to tell a story.  You have Tarkovsky's father (the acclaimed Russian poet Arseny Tarkovsky) reciting his stately poems in his rich voice over long continuous shots detailing the director's childhood memory in the countryside, when his father went off to fight the war.Created scenes intersect with historical footage to present a fugal magnum opus onscreen.  Tarkovsky studied Arabic in the university, and he had a love of J.S. Bach's music (which is present here along with Purcell's works and Eduard Artemyev) which means he has an appreciation from Zakhrafa art and labyrinthian schemes.  For those who may not be familiar with Bach's compositions, three or four melodies interweave with each other to create a *fugue*, which uses sound to play off each other in a device called counterpoint.  Tarkovsky recreates this structure visually, where time is nonlinear, and each actor plays several characters, switching between present and past.This is Tarkovsky's way of presenting our persona as a composite of all our experiences and memory.Do yourself a favor.  Don't wait for the right version.  This movie is strong enough to pull through all the scratches, pops, hiss, clicks, and color discrepancies.",5,"Don't Get Bogged Down with the Technical Issues, Just Watch It.",1210377600,"05 10, 2008",2008,2694,"['know', 'are', 'websites', 'devoted', 'comparing', 'different', 'transfers', 'Tarkovsky', 'movies', 'age-old', 'Kino', 'vs.', 'R.U.S.C.I.C.O..', 'have', 'pluses', 'minuses', 'first', 'difference', 'color', 'Kino', 'edition', 'more', 'saturated', 'audio', 'track', 'tin-can', 'reverb', 'delaying', 'almost', 'point', 'where', 'music', ""n't"", 'match', 'then', 'matter', 'translation.I', 'consider', 'huge', 'fan', 'Andrei', 'Tarkovski', 'work', 'own', 'versions', 'had', 'obtain', 'long', 'Amazon', 'even', 'carried', 'are', 'same', 'editions', 'am', 'reminded', 'old', 'scratchy', 'King', 'Pleasure', 'record', 'own', 'been', 'played', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'could', 'hear', 'scratch', 'pop', 'click', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'least', 'bit', 'enjoyment', 'Why', 'IT', 'THE', 'QUALITY', 'THE', 'WORK', 'THAT', 'COUNTS', 'not', 'quality', 'media.I', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'big', 'screen', 'Lincoln', 'Center', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'recently', 'carefully', 'restored', 'corrected', 'translation', 'came', 'home', 'watched', 'copies', 'next', 'day', 'compare', 'opinion', 'non-Russian', 'speaker', 'graduated', 'English', 'major', 'minor', 'discrepancies', 'lack', 'transfer', 'DOES', 'NOT', 'outweigh', 'fantastic', 'quality', 'film-making', 'presented', 'here.Tarkovsky', 'one', 'recent', 'Russian', 'film', 'greats', 'movie', 'seen', 'many', 'apex', 'creativity', 'Last', 'time', 'checked', 'film', 'more', 'mere', 'images', 'audio', 'visual', 'script', 'angles', 'color', 'combined', 'tell', 'story', 'have', 'Tarkovsky', 'father', 'acclaimed', 'Russian', 'poet', 'Arseny', 'Tarkovsky', 'reciting', 'stately', 'poems', 'rich', 'voice', 'long', 'continuous', 'shots', 'detailing', 'director', 'childhood', 'memory', 'countryside', 'when', 'father', 'went', 'fight', 'war.Created', 'scenes', 'intersect', 'historical', 'footage', 'present', 'fugal', 'magnum', 'opus', 'onscreen', 'Tarkovsky', 'studied', 'Arabic', 'university', 'had', 'love', 'J.S', 'Bach', 'music', 'present', 'here', 'Purcell', 'works', 'Eduard', 'Artemyev', 'appreciation', 'Zakhrafa', 'art', 'labyrinthian', 'schemes', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'familiar', 'Bach', 'compositions', 'three', 'four', 'melodies', 'interweave', 'other', 'create', '*fugue*', 'sound', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'device', 'called', 'counterpoint', 'Tarkovsky', 'structure', 'visually', 'where', 'time', 'nonlinear', 'actor', 'several', 'characters', 'switching', 'present', 'past.This', 'Tarkovsky', 'way', 'presenting', 'persona', 'composite', 'experiences', 'memory.Do', 'favor', 'Do', ""n't"", 'wait', 'right', 'version', 'movie', 'strong', 'enough', 'pull', 'scratches', 'pops', 'hiss', 'clicks', 'color', 'discrepancies']",The Mirror VHS
254862,A3OJ012QPTGMLR,630154028X,R. J MOSS,"[8, 8]","At the pinnacle of his powers, Tarakovsky made this remarkable auto-biographical work, pushing cinema's powers to replicate dreams in a way that renders Surrealist 'dream' paintings redundant. Bergman, Resnais, and Bunuel had tackled the dreamworld too. But here, the commitment is ravishing. The best way to imbibe its spell is to surrender any urgency to make narrative sense, and allow the images to wash over you. This is true of all Tarakovsky, but moreso here. His familiar images, of rain, sodden earth, wood-floored interiors, sussurating meadows and leaves, red-haired women, and kids with lip herpes, are all  displayed. His aural net is on a par with the visuals; the barking dogs, Bach chorales, the squark of a beheaded chicken, sumptuous and thrilling. The prologue has a stuttering boy cured by a hypnotist and announcing (in lieu of Tarakovsky) that he will now speak clear and strong. The Kafkaesque corridors of the printworks, the family home all paint the new language that the director felt film, alone, could offer. As a vehicle for memory, dream, perception and the blurred edges they inhabit, this confessional film is close to describing how consciousness flickers in and out of control and focus. Key images, even those supplied by old newsreels, establish chronolgical footholds. Note the slightly askew sound and image tracking used sparingly, the minutely slowed down feeling of some passages. Tarakovsky's father occasionally reads his poetry over the film, adding tonal tension. In fact he is more present through voiceover than his embodied character in the film. His mother is present, at times tantalizingly so. Yet she remains withdrawn from the son, which may account for the love Tarakovsky subsequently projected with such intense palpability on the textures of the world. Watch this over and again.

254865,A2AREUQXKG7PCG,630154028X,Snow Leopard,"[33, 34]","Be sure to read Vlad's review of the shoddy quality of this DVD.  As a non-Russian speaker, I am essentially spared the awful knowledge of just what has been done to this film.At first viewing, unless you are an incredibly perspicacious viewer, this movie will be utterly baffling, partly because Tarkovsky has gone to such lengths to blur past and present.  The same actress plays the protagonist's ex-wife in the present and mother in the past and the same actor plays the protagonist's son in the present and himself in the past. Sometimes the present is in color, the past in black & white; having established this expectation, Tarkovsky then reverses it on you later.  Yet other times, dreams are in color and reality is in that tantalizing shade of sepia-color-black & white that Tarkovsky has used elsewhere (especially in ""Stalker"").In fact, I was so baffled when I first saw the film that I simply gave up trying to follow the narrative and basked in the intense beauty of the film work.  The dream sequence of the mother washing her hair, for instance, is utterly mesmerizing. The long shot that carries us from a table out to witness a burning building is breathtaking in all of the various reflections and reversals of angles it uses along the way.  The final shot of an old women and two children walking into a field as the camera pulls slowly into deeper and deeper woods until finally the people are completely concealed by the trees often chokes me up, and I couldn't tell you why.  Even the opening scene, simply a conversation on a fence by a field, is an exquisitely choreographed ballet of cinematography.This most personal of Tarkovsky's intensely personal body of work is essentially biographical, but no self-respecting member of the Russian intelligentsia, at least not one of Tarkovsky's disposition, could ever justify such a self-indulgence as mere biography. Consequently, we never see the protagonist, save for his hand when he is ill and overhearing his voice. This erasure of his adult self, and the inclusion of newsreel footage of key historical moments during the protagonist's life, aim at creating a generalized biography for all of Russia.  An especially striking moment shows news footage of Russian soldiers slogging muddily through a bog.  As soon as one has the full impression that this is human life in a thoroughly degraded condition, a voiceover of one of Tarkovsky's father's poems talks of immortality, sublime beauty, the very loftiest of human sentiments on spirituality.  The contrast is deliberate, but not ironic, and illustrates a triumph of the human spirit in even the most unlikely of places and times.  Elsewhere, Tarkovsky makes a religion of elevating the mundane.  In his book on his work, he admits that one of his techniques (he denies there is anything symbolic in his work) is to focus on an object for so long that the viewer inevitably begins to wonder at, and thereby increase the significance of it.Perhaps if the subtitles were better, I'd better understand the film.  As it is, the sheer intensity of the films gorgeousness never ceases to amaze me.  The dream sequences alone are simply amazing. There have been other movies that might here or there exceed the Mirror in beauty for a moment or two (""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" comes to mind), but I've never found one that can even come close to matching its consistency throughout.

254867,A2AJMMNO4S3IK,630154028X,"Tintin ""tintin75""","[6, 8]","Mirror (rus., Zerkalo, 1975), is unquestionably the masterpiece of Andrei Tarkovsky's opus. It is an autobiographical film, with a rather unconventional timeline. Its structure is somewhat convoluted, making it relatively inaccessible on first viewing. Fortunately, the beauty of its images and its lyricism carry you along, and most certainly compel you to a second viewing, and then you are ""hooked."" At least, this was my experience with this film.Mirror represents the recollections of a dying man, weighing the episodes of his life in his conscience. It is also autobiographical reflection of the author on the final stretch of the race toward the finish line of his life. His thoughts ebb and flow, as he contemplates his life's journey.What kind of mirror is it?  It's the author's broken mirror, whose shards have been re-assembled and glued in a random fashion, with each piece reflecting an aspect of his soul. Tarkovsky's mind wanders as he recounts some of the events of his past at least the way he remembers them. The memories are set against a Russian historical backdrop from the early Stalin years to the early 70s. Tarkovsky weaves newsreels, poems, and dramatic scenes to suggest his symbolic inner world; his relationships with his mother, his ex-wife, and his son, and with the world in which he has lived.The film, based on Tarkovsky's own screenplay. Some press interviews and writings of Tarkovsky leave no doubt that all of these events are true recollections concerning his family, his life as he has lived it and felt it. All the episodes are really part of his family history, except for one, and he undertook to literally replicate what was fixed in his memory. The only fictional episode is the illness of the narrator, which is intended to convey the author's spiritual crisis. As such, this fictional contrivance is a foundation for all of the others, utterly true remembrances.The pace of the film is slow. As in most of Tarkovsky's other films, we see long shots, which lead to lengthy contemplations on the viewer's part, requiring the absorption of a considerable amount of fine visual details. This in turn leads the viewer into an emotional involvement with the characters. By using long shots and few cuts in his films, Tarkovsky gives the viewers a sense of time passing, and the relationship of one moment to another, as opposed to the speedy jump-cut, Hollywood style. Tarkovsky developed a theory of cinema that he called ""sculpting in time,"" which was, using the unique characteristic of cinema as a medium, to take one's experience of time and alter it. This film is the best example of the application of his theory.Not only does Tarkovsky ""sculpt in time"" by manipulating events in an apparent random-time fashion, he also manipulates time within a particular event by using mirrors, which reflects different times, past or future, which are not of that event. There are many such examples throughout the film.The beauty and lyricism of the images are due to Tarkovsky's unmistakable poetic style. The childhood memories, hypnotic in their intensity, are the most visually stunning filmmaking imaginable. These dream-like sequences are also the most enigmatic moments of the film, which most likely accounts for the film's alleged impenetrability.Mirror is about the lives of the most important figures in Tarkovsky's life: his mother and his wife (interestingly, played by the same actress). From Tarkovsky's own admission, his father had no inner influence on him. His mother was the most important person in his life so much so that, for Tarkovsky, there was no question that she had to appear in person in several scenes.Although Tarkovsky never made an explicitly political film, the relationship of the individual to history was central to his world view. In terms of a person's spiritual experience, what happened to that person yesterday may be as significant as what happened to humanity a hundred years ago. From that point of view, the film is about the nature of Russia as a mediator between the East and the West, as portrayed in the scene where Ignat reads Pushkin's letter to Chaadayev (October 19, 1836), and a little later in the film, in the footage of Russian soldiers holding back a demonstration of Chinese Maoists.Mirror is also about the Stalinist purges of the mid-to-late 1930s and World War II. Tarkovsky shows us archive footage of contemporary events with complete detachment in contrast with the extreme intimacy of the memories. It is expressed, for example, by the apparently strange inclusion of the documentary footage of the Soviet army crossing the Sivash marshes. The poem by his father, Arseni Tarkovsky, which accompanies the Sivah crossing, is particularly telling.To summarize this beautiful and unusual film, I will quote the author himself (upon leaving the screening of Mirror), ""When I left the cinema I was thinking that here was a film made as a poem, that it was - a cinematic impossibility it would seem - an intimate lyrical monologue.""",5,Tarkovsky's Masterpiece,1104624000,"01 2, 2005",2005,5032,"['Mirror', 'rus.', 'Zerkalo', '1975', 'unquestionably', 'masterpiece', 'Andrei', 'Tarkovsky', 'opus', 'autobiographical', 'film', 'rather', 'unconventional', 'timeline', 'structure', 'somewhat', 'convoluted', 'making', 'relatively', 'inaccessible', 'first', 'viewing', 'Fortunately', 'beauty', 'images', 'lyricism', 'carry', 'most', 'certainly', 'compel', 'second', 'viewing', 'then', 'are', 'hooked', 'least', 'was', 'experience', 'film.Mirror', 'recollections', 'dying', 'man', 'weighing', 'episodes', 'life', 'conscience', 'also', 'autobiographical', 'reflection', 'author', 'final', 'stretch', 'race', 'finish', 'line', 'life', 'thoughts', 'ebb', 'flow', 'life', 'kind', 'mirror', 'author', 'broken', 'mirror', 'shards', 'have', 'been', 're-assembled', 'glued', 'random', 'fashion', 'piece', 'reflecting', 'aspect', 'soul', 'Tarkovsky', 'mind', 'wanders', 'events', 'past', 'least', 'way', 'memories', 'are', 'set', 'Russian', 'historical', 'backdrop', 'early', 'Stalin', 'years', 'early', '70s', 'Tarkovsky', 'newsreels', 'poems', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'suggest', 'symbolic', 'inner', 'world', 'relationships', 'mother', 'ex-wife', 'son', 'world', 'lived.The', 'film', 'based', 'Tarkovsky', 'own', 'screenplay', 'press', 'interviews', 'writings', 'Tarkovsky', 'leave', 'doubt', 'events', 'are', 'true', 'recollections', 'concerning', 'family', 'life', 'lived', 'felt', 'episodes', 'are', 'really', 'part', 'family', 'history', 'one', 'undertook', 'literally', 'replicate', 'what', 'was', 'fixed', 'memory', 'only', 'fictional', 'episode', 'illness', 'narrator', 'intended', 'convey', 'author', 'spiritual', 'crisis', 'such', 'fictional', 'contrivance', 'foundation', 'others', 'utterly', 'true', 'remembrances.The', 'pace', 'film', 'slow', 'most', 'Tarkovsky', 'other', 'films', 'see', 'long', 'shots', 'lead', 'lengthy', 'contemplations', 'viewer', 'part', 'requiring', 'absorption', 'considerable', 'amount', 'fine', 'visual', 'details', 'turn', 'viewer', 'emotional', 'involvement', 'characters', 'using', 'long', 'shots', 'few', 'cuts', 'films', 'Tarkovsky', 'viewers', 'sense', 'time', 'passing', 'relationship', 'one', 'moment', 'opposed', 'speedy', 'jump-cut', 'Hollywood', 'style', 'Tarkovsky', 'developed', 'theory', 'cinema', 'called', 'sculpting', 'time', 'was', 'using', 'unique', 'characteristic', 'cinema', 'medium', 'take', 'one', 'experience', 'time', 'alter', 'film', 'best', 'example', 'application', 'theory.Not', 'only', 'Tarkovsky', 'sculpt', 'time', 'manipulating', 'events', 'apparent', 'random-time', 'fashion', 'also', 'time', 'particular', 'event', 'using', 'mirrors', 'different', 'times', 'past', 'future', 'are', 'not', 'event', 'are', 'many', 'such', 'examples', 'film.The', 'beauty', 'lyricism', 'images', 'are', 'due', 'Tarkovsky', 'unmistakable', 'poetic', 'style', 'childhood', 'memories', 'hypnotic', 'intensity', 'are', 'most', 'visually', 'stunning', 'filmmaking', 'imaginable', 'dream-like', 'sequences', 'are', 'also', 'most', 'enigmatic', 'moments', 'film', 'most', 'likely', 'accounts', 'film', 'alleged', 'impenetrability.Mirror', 'lives', 'most', 'important', 'figures', 'Tarkovsky', 'life', 'mother', 'wife', 'interestingly', 'played', 'same', 'actress', 'Tarkovsky', 'own', 'admission', 'father', 'had', 'inner', 'influence', 'mother', 'was', 'most', 'important', 'person', 'life', 'so', 'much', 'Tarkovsky', 'was', 'question', 'had', 'appear', 'person', 'several', 'scenes.Although', 'Tarkovsky', 'never', 'made', 'explicitly', 'political', 'film', 'relationship', 'individual', 'history', 'was', 'central', 'world', 'view', 'terms', 'person', 'spiritual', 'experience', 'what', 'happened', 'person', 'yesterday', 'may', 'be', 'as', 'significant', 'what', 'happened', 'humanity', 'hundred', 'years', 'ago', 'point', 'view', 'film', 'nature', 'Russia', 'mediator', 'East', 'West', 'portrayed', 'scene', 'where', 'Ignat', 'Pushkin', 'letter', 'Chaadayev', 'October', '19', '1836', 'little', 'later', 'film', 'footage', 'Russian', 'soldiers', 'holding', 'back', 'demonstration', 'Chinese', 'Maoists.Mirror', 'also', 'Stalinist', 'purges', 'mid-to-late', '1930s', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Tarkovsky', 'archive', 'footage', 'contemporary', 'events', 'complete', 'detachment', 'contrast', 'extreme', 'intimacy', 'memories', 'expressed', 'example', 'apparently', 'strange', 'inclusion', 'documentary', 'footage', 'Soviet', 'army', 'crossing', 'Sivash', 'marshes', 'poem', 'father', 'Arseni', 'Tarkovsky', 'Sivah', 'crossing', 'particularly', 'telling.To', 'summarize', 'beautiful', 'unusual', 'film', 'will', 'quote', 'author', 'leaving', 'screening', 'Mirror', 'When', 'left', 'cinema', 'was', 'thinking', 'here', 'was', 'film', 'made', 'poem', 'was', 'cinematic', 'impossibility', 'would', 'seem', 'intimate', 'lyrical', 'monologue']",The Mirror VHS
254868,A3T689SS856U3N,630154028X,Vincent Lassauw,"[2, 2]","'The Mirror' is Tarkovsky's autobiographical masterpiece about which there is both little and a lot to say. As all his work, seeing this movie is something one must experience as it is such a different kind of cinema as that of any other director. Not a movie for those with a short attention span one could argue that The Mirror is about the overwhelming power that memories can have on our lives. As stated the movie more or less is autobiographic as we see Tarkovsky's childhood years in the country, to which many Russians fled from WWII, brought there by his mother. His father, the famous Russian poet Arsenii Tarkovsky is not present, except through citations from his poetry by means of a voice over, while we look at beautiful Russian scenery or archive images of soldiers walking through swamps. Apart from a visual feast the movie also offers an auditorial banquet not only of recited poems but also wonderful music, which plays a crucial part (as always in Tarkovsky's movies).The story timeline of the movie at first viewing may prove to be somewhat confusing, as there is continuous interplay between past and present. In the present time of the movie the main character is a divorced man, obviously an intellectual, who both spiritually as well as emotionally is in a crisis. In this state he has a series of childhood recollections and the movie throws in an extra free of charge bit of 20th century Russian history into the mix. It is shown how he grew up in the country, how Spanish civil war survivors fled to Russia, how he was military trained in Leningrad as a boy during WWII and got to know his first love, how his mother lived in a printing shop under Stalin's censorship, Soviet-Chinese border tensions after the Chinese revolution etc.Confusing in all this is that his mother in the flashbacks is played by the same actress as the main protagonist's current ex-wife, even though he says as much in a phonecall with his ex that when he has childhood recollections of his mother she always looks like his ex. The story itself is pretty simple, but it's complex through the way it is structured, especially the first time one sees the movie, but this is true for any Tarkovsky movie. Each movie  should be watched at least three times to get any kind of understanding of what they are about, which however doesn't mean one can't immensely enjoy them first time around. What worked for me on first viewings was not over analyzing too much and simply let the movie take me along, the perfect acting, the beauty of the images, the musical splendor and magnificent poetry.This was the first Tarkovsky movie I ever saw a long time ago and it changed the way I looked at art in general and cinema in particular.It's my sincere wish to any Tarkovsky 'newbie' to have a similar wonderful experience.The one star missing in my judgment is due to the rather bad visual quality of this release, which is quite a shame and, as a Russian friend assured me, quite bad translation.

There is no use of black and white when a memory creeps in, there's no dreamlike music that sets in when a sc?ne is occurring in the mind of a sleeping protagonist. Remember Alain Resnais' ""Last year at Marienbad"" in which present and past are mixed together and dissolve in each other without technical warnings for the audience. Resnais, by the way, did the same in his landmark debut ""Hiroshima mon Amour"" and would make a carreer out of movies in which chronological way of story telling is thrown out of the window very early on.Also the great Spanish surrealist Luis Bu?uel enjoyed confusing his viewers this way with films like ""The Exterminating angel"", ""The phantom of liberty"" and ""The discrete charme of the bourgeoisie"", mixing seemingly realistic moments with surrealistic immagery and dreamlike-sequences.Of the nowadays successful operating directors, David Lynch is perhaps the most widely known, with his non-logical, or rather a-logical movie puzzles like ""Lost Highway"" and his masterful creation ""Mullholland Dr.""""Mirror"" now, is an intimate view of ordinary life in Russia seen through the eyes of someone who doesn't seem to share much onscreen time. The result, in the hands of  the amazing Andrej Tarkovski, is however not ordinary but extraordinary in the biggest sence of the word. Startling images follow one another up in fast time, in a movie that is, on the contrary, to say the least, deliberatly paced (as are all of Tarkovski's efforts, who, all of his film carreer and, wanted spirituallity and contemplation as main goals.)Water, fire, wind, poems, all elements are part of the memories we witness, as are the faces that pass by the camera, faces filled with, or rather scarred by, deeply rooted maturity unexplained sorrow, and sheer character.In less gifted hands, all shown technical flares would be just show-offs, but Tarkovski makes sure that every everlasting vision portrayed here, is not only top-notch in its form, but is also the basic for his story telling and is quiet hunt of meditation. And although ""Mirror"" sees to be more a labyrinth of associative imagery and mis-en-sc?ne than a straight forward narrative, it's a huge story one can find `between the poetic lines' if one is patient enough to go along with Tarkovsi's own private sculpting of time.At the end, ""Mirror"" is more than anything a cinematic experience, it's a movie that reflects both vision and thoughts... pondering and meandering... but ever so intimate and rewarding.",5,"A mirror that reflects memories, poems and dreams",1146096000,"04 27, 2006",2006,2640,"['Mirror', 'one', 'movies', 'facts', 'poetry', 'reminiscences', 'dreams', 'making', 'audience', 'clear', 'what', 'are', 'looking', 'use', 'black', 'white', 'when', 'memory', 'creeps', 'dreamlike', 'music', 'when', 'sc', 'ne', 'occurring', 'mind', 'sleeping', 'protagonist', 'Remember', 'Alain', 'Resnais', 'Last', 'year', 'Marienbad', 'present', 'past', 'are', 'mixed', 'together', 'dissolve', 'other', 'technical', 'warnings', 'audience', 'Resnais', 'way', 'did', 'same', 'landmark', 'debut', 'Hiroshima', 'mon', 'Amour', 'would', 'make', 'carreer', 'movies', 'chronological', 'way', 'story', 'telling', 'thrown', 'window', 'very', 'early', 'great', 'Spanish', 'surrealist', 'Luis', 'Bu', 'uel', 'enjoyed', 'confusing', 'viewers', 'way', 'films', 'Exterminating', 'angel', 'phantom', 'liberty', 'discrete', 'charme', 'bourgeoisie', 'mixing', 'seemingly', 'realistic', 'moments', 'surrealistic', 'immagery', 'dreamlike-sequences.Of', 'nowadays', 'successful', 'operating', 'directors', 'David', 'Lynch', 'perhaps', 'most', 'widely', 'known', 'non-logical', 'rather', 'a-logical', 'movie', 'puzzles', 'Lost', 'Highway', 'masterful', 'creation', 'Mullholland', 'Dr.', 'Mirror', 'now', 'intimate', 'view', 'ordinary', 'life', 'Russia', 'seen', 'eyes', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'share', 'much', 'onscreen', 'time', 'result', 'hands', 'amazing', 'Andrej', 'Tarkovski', 'however', 'not', 'ordinary', 'extraordinary', 'biggest', 'sence', 'word', 'Startling', 'images', 'follow', 'one', 'up', 'fast', 'time', 'movie', 'contrary', 'say', 'least', 'deliberatly', 'paced', 'are', 'Tarkovski', 'efforts', 'who', 'film', 'carreer', 'wanted', 'spirituallity', 'contemplation', 'main', 'goals', 'Water', 'fire', 'wind', 'poems', 'elements', 'are', 'part', 'memories', 'witness', 'are', 'pass', 'camera', 'filled', 'rather', 'scarred', 'deeply', 'rooted', 'maturity', 'unexplained', 'sorrow', 'sheer', 'character.In', 'gifted', 'hands', 'shown', 'technical', 'flares', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'show-offs', 'Tarkovski', 'sure', 'everlasting', 'vision', 'portrayed', 'here', 'not', 'only', 'top-notch', 'form', 'also', 'basic', 'story', 'telling', 'quiet', 'hunt', 'meditation', 'Mirror', 'be', 'more', 'labyrinth', 'associative', 'imagery', 'mis-en-sc', 'ne', 'straight', 'forward', 'narrative', 'huge', 'story', 'one', 'can', 'find', 'poetic', 'lines', 'one', 'patient', 'enough', 'go', 'along', 'Tarkovsi', 'own', 'private', 'sculpting', 'time.At', 'end', 'Mirror', 'more', 'anything', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'movie', 'vision', 'thoughts', 'pondering', 'meandering', 'ever', 'so', 'intimate', 'rewarding']",The Mirror VHS
