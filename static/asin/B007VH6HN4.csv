1538710,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B007VH6HN4,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","There is something truly appalling about this movie, and yet it is truly hilarious so I guess those two factors balance each other out.  I mean, the extreme nature of the comedy here is something that cannot be shaken.  From giving his mother-in-law a pearl necklace (don't Google that) to making fun of a young boy's anatomy, this film is full of some of the most obnoxious and explicit moments of `adult' comedy I've seen in a film.  I know that I should be repulsed, but I don't think I stopped laughing once.  It's extreme, but that's the point of it all.  It holds fast to this awkward sense of honesty and so it never feels like it's too much.  To be honest, it kind of all works.The film, apparently inspired by a television show of the same name, follows two lovable fools who are far too immature for their own good.  Frank's girlfriend is pregnant and he's trying to prove to her that he's responsible, but his lack of good judgment leads to some pretty awful results and he winds up kidnapping her nephew in order to prove to her that he can take care of a kid.  He takes the boy, Bo, on a `guys weekend' with his buddy Casper, who is not happy about the extra passenger because he feels like it will dampen his chances at getting laid.  Traveling by canoe, the two chase High School girls down a river in pursuit of a famed brothel that Casper thinks he can get into.  Along the way, Frank grows up (sort of) and Casper shows his true colors (sort of).The finale pretty much sums up the whole movie; disturbing and repulsive and yet you can't look away or stop laughing long enough to turn the movie off.",4,I shouldn't be laughing at this...,1366070400,"04 16, 2013",2013,1616,"['something', 'truly', 'appalling', 'movie', 'yet', 'truly', 'hilarious', 'guess', 'two', 'factors', 'other', 'mean', 'extreme', 'nature', 'comedy', 'here', 'something', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'shaken', 'giving', 'mother-in-law', 'pearl', 'necklace', 'do', ""n't"", 'Google', 'making', 'fun', 'young', 'boy', 'anatomy', 'film', 'full', 'most', 'obnoxious', 'explicit', 'moments', 'adult', 'comedy', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'know', 'should', 'be', 'repulsed', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'stopped', 'laughing', 'once', 'extreme', 'point', 'fast', 'awkward', 'sense', 'honesty', 'never', 'too', 'much', 'be', 'honest', 'kind', 'works.The', 'film', 'apparently', 'inspired', 'television', 'show', 'same', 'name', 'two', 'lovable', 'fools', 'who', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'immature', 'own', 'good', 'Frank', 'girlfriend', 'pregnant', 'trying', 'prove', 'responsible', 'lack', 'good', 'judgment', 'pretty', 'awful', 'results', 'up', 'kidnapping', 'nephew', 'order', 'prove', 'can', 'take', 'care', 'kid', 'boy', 'Bo', 'guys', 'weekend', 'buddy', 'Casper', 'who', 'not', 'happy', 'extra', 'passenger', 'will', 'dampen', 'chances', 'getting', 'laid', 'Traveling', 'canoe', 'two', 'chase', 'High', 'School', 'girls', 'down', 'river', 'pursuit', 'famed', 'brothel', 'Casper', 'can', 'get', 'way', 'Frank', 'up', 'sort', 'Casper', 'true', 'colors', 'sort', '.The', 'finale', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'whole', 'movie', 'disturbing', 'repulsive', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'look', 'away', 'stop', 'laughing', 'long', 'enough', 'turn', 'movie', 'off']",N/A

1538713,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B007VH6HN4,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[1, 1]","Klown is one of the raunchiest, crudest, funniest movies I've watched in a long time. This movie is not for everybody. Anybody that is easily offended should avoid this movie. The jokes are foul.Frank and Casper are married buddies that go on an annual canoe trip. Casper is the slick, charming, cool guy that gets away with everything. Frank is his clumsy, socially inept buddy that says things most people might be thinking, but would never say out loud. One of the few examples that can be mentioned, Casper and Frank belong to a men's book club. Frank tells Casper he hasn't read the book. Casper admits he hasn't read the book either. During the book discussion, Frank pipes up immediately and says, let's get this taken care of immediately, I haven't read the book. The answer is for him to leave the meeting. Frank says, others haven't read the book either. The leader asks who hasn't read the book, Casper doesn't raise his hand. The point, Casper goes through this movie getting away with everything, and Casper manages to admit to the wrong thing all the time.This is a crude road movie. It isn't funny over the top like The Hangover. It is a more subtle comedy with more graphic humor. After all this is a Danish film, and their sense of acceptable jokes is much further out there than Hollywood. I really enjoyed this film. It is a blending of a scripted film, a documentary, and a television series. The director has taken the best of these styles to make this film.The two lead actors also wrote the script. They oddly use their real names in the movie. Both men are not afraid to show off their naked bodies or wandering around in whitie tightie underwear. The young boy that played Bo was the butt of many bad jokes. The film is an hour and a half and about the right length. There was enough time to get to know the three males and care about what happened to them.The film is rated R, and deserves this rating for language, nudity, and drug use. The old Jack Valenti led MPAA would have probably given this an NC-17 rating. There are no two ways around it; this is a very crude film. There are more penis jokes than I've seen in a long time. The film is presented in Danish with English subtitles that cannot be turned off. Younger viewers need not apply to watch this film.The DVD is chock full of special features. Probably best to watch them after the movie. The alternate opening scene is pretty darn good - it is almost a coin toss to use the out take or the one used in release. I really liked the 30 minute episode of the Danish television program Klovn. Apparently there are more episodes of this series. The episode focuses on Frank and his wife. He finds out that she goes to a friend's house to learn how to masturbate. There are other related threads through the episode. The blooper reel is not very good - actors flubbing their lines and laughing gets old after thirty seconds. All in all, there is about 40 minutes of bonus materials.This film is not a date movie, it is ultra-crude. Some of the jokes are cringe worthy, but most are genuinely funny. This is a Danish road movie in a canoe.",5,Raunchy And Crude,1367625600,"05 4, 2013",2013,3123,"['Klown', 'one', 'raunchiest', 'crudest', 'funniest', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'long', 'time', 'movie', 'not', 'everybody', 'Anybody', 'easily', 'offended', 'should', 'avoid', 'movie', 'jokes', 'are', 'foul.Frank', 'Casper', 'are', 'married', 'buddies', 'go', 'annual', 'canoe', 'trip', 'Casper', 'slick', 'charming', 'cool', 'guy', 'away', 'everything', 'Frank', 'clumsy', 'socially', 'inept', 'buddy', 'things', 'most', 'people', 'might', 'be', 'thinking', 'would', 'never', 'say', 'out', 'loud', 'One', 'few', 'examples', 'can', 'be', 'mentioned', 'Casper', 'Frank', 'belong', 'men', 'book', 'club', 'Frank', 'Casper', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'Casper', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'book', 'discussion', 'Frank', 'up', 'immediately', 'let', 'get', 'taken', 'care', 'immediately', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'answer', 'leave', 'meeting', 'Frank', 'others', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'leader', 'asks', 'who', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'Casper', ""n't"", 'raise', 'hand', 'point', 'Casper', 'movie', 'getting', 'away', 'everything', 'Casper', 'admit', 'wrong', 'thing', 'time.This', 'crude', 'road', 'movie', ""n't"", 'funny', 'top', 'Hangover', 'more', 'subtle', 'comedy', 'more', 'graphic', 'humor', 'Danish', 'film', 'sense', 'acceptable', 'jokes', 'much', 'further', 'there', 'Hollywood', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'blending', 'scripted', 'film', 'documentary', 'television', 'series', 'director', 'taken', 'best', 'styles', 'make', 'film.The', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'also', 'wrote', 'script', 'oddly', 'use', 'real', 'names', 'movie', 'men', 'are', 'not', 'afraid', 'show', 'off', 'naked', 'bodies', 'wandering', 'around', 'whitie', 'tightie', 'underwear', 'young', 'boy', 'played', 'Bo', 'was', 'butt', 'many', 'bad', 'jokes', 'film', 'hour', 'half', 'right', 'length', 'was', 'enough', 'time', 'get', 'know', 'three', 'males', 'care', 'what', 'happened', 'them.The', 'film', 'rated', 'R', 'rating', 'language', 'nudity', 'drug', 'use', 'old', 'Jack', 'Valenti', 'led', 'MPAA', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'given', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'are', 'two', 'ways', 'very', 'crude', 'film', 'are', 'more', 'penis', 'jokes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'film', 'presented', 'Danish', 'English', 'subtitles', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'Younger', 'viewers', 'need', 'not', 'apply', 'watch', 'film.The', 'DVD', 'chock', 'full', 'special', 'features', 'Probably', 'best', 'watch', 'movie', 'alternate', 'opening', 'scene', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'almost', 'coin', 'toss', 'use', 'out', 'take', 'one', 'used', 'release', 'really', 'liked', '30', 'minute', 'episode', 'Danish', 'television', 'program', 'Klovn', 'Apparently', 'are', 'more', 'episodes', 'series', 'episode', 'Frank', 'wife', 'out', 'friend', 'house', 'learn', 'how', 'masturbate', 'are', 'other', 'related', 'threads', 'episode', 'blooper', 'reel', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'actors', 'flubbing', 'lines', 'laughing', 'old', 'thirty', 'seconds', '40', 'minutes', 'bonus', 'materials.This', 'film', 'not', 'date', 'movie', 'ultra-crude', 'jokes', 'are', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'most', 'are', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'Danish', 'road', 'movie', 'canoe']",N/A

That's the kind of laughter you will experience while watching this movie.Here's the scoop. Frank is about to embark on a canoeing trip with his bud Casper which will culminate at a rock concert and a trip to a very exclusive house of ill repute. But just prior to cast-off he finds out his Girlfriend is pregnant and he must bring a friend's young son in tow. Can Frank step up to the plate in the fatherhood department? Not looking good for our buddy Frank.This is some way raunchy stuff. Frank is spineless and cannot see himself as a father. Casper is married but wants this trip to score some big-time womanhood. They manage to screw up one thing after another because of their stupidity and selfishness. They do things that make you so uncomfortable you will find yourself turning away. But these same things are hilarious. That two grown men would behave in such a manner boggles the mind.This Danish outing is not all that fancy. It's plainly shot with a lot of natural lighting. But the camera is framed well and things move well within the frame. What's happening here is the writing. These characters and situations have to be seen to be believed.

There is an uncanny resemblance between Frank Hvam and Larry and if you enjoyed Curb Your Enthusiasm, you'll like this movie.The big surprise is that it's from Denmark.  Now don't get me wrong. I have nothing but admiration for the Danes. In fact all Scandinavians rank high with me. Just look how well they run their own countries. We should look to them for guidance. Even the food isn't bad, except for the lutefisk. It's just that, until now, I was under the impression that Scandinavians lacked the humor gene.  This was not an idle assumption; it was based on the jokes I was told by people from that part of the world. First, a Danish Joke: ""We call hamburgers 'russian elevator operators' in denmark. Because they are minced meat as you will be if you let one operate an elevator. Hahahahahahaha.""  No, I'm not kidding. And the teller was an adult. Really.Okay, get ready for the second joke. It was told to me by someone from Sweden.  ""Oh I am so sad, my cousin is dead.""  ""What happened?""  ""He shot himself."" ""Oh no, why?""  ""Because his wife served roast pork and red cabbage for dinner.""  ""That is no reason to kill youself!""  ""But he had it for lunch.""See.  So when I watched Klown, I was not expecting much, which made the laughs all the more surprising. This is a very funny movie. In a very basic, stupid, gross, raunchy way.There is also a Danish TV series called Klown and the film is obviously a spinoff.  Watch both. The sitcom came first. According to an interview with Frankie Hvam(co-star, co-creator and Larry Davidsen clone, he and his partner Casper Christiansen made a list of the 20 most serious social taboos...cannibalism, Down Syndrome, death, physical handicaps, pedophelia, cancer -- the usual suspects -- and devoted one episode to exploiting each. What's not to love?For the movie, Hvam and Christiansen use the premise of impending fatherhood to find new, funny and really upsetting ways to poke fun at these and other sensitive social issues. Here's the synopsis in brief: Frankie's girlfriend is pregnant and she fears he is not good father material. Boy howdy. Naturally Frankie wants to prove her wrong, so he and buddy Casper do the only reasonable thing: kidnap her thirteen year old nephew and take him on a canoe trip.Okay. Yeah it's nuts, but it's not the stupidest thing two adults have ever done, right?  Wrong. This is not just a canoe trip. It is a Denmark wide spree of sexual debauchery, drinking and bad behavior that makes American Pie and Weekend At Bernies look like studies by Margaret Mead. Frankie and Casper are going to have one last fling before settling down and the presence of the kid isn't going to stop them.  The kid, by the way, is brilliant. Hulking, sulking and bulking. Typical 13 year old lout, but (and again, it's part of the movie's inexplicable charm), likable.  Somehow they manage to make it all funny...the kind of funny that sneaks up on you in your outrage and makes you laugh out loud in spite of yourself. It's smart dumb humor that offends and delights simultaneously.The film is available on Amazon, the TV series on Hulu. If you enjoy broad humor that is not just broad, but actually fresh and funny and takes no prisoners, you'll enjoy both.I guess now that the Scandinavians have demonstrated they do, indeed, understand the meaning of funny, the Swiss are now, officially, the only people so utterly devoid of humor, they look to Iceland as the comedy center of the Universe. Here are some examples of Swiss kneeslappers. They were painstakingly researched from Swiss internet sites and the one person I know who comes from that place. You tell me if I'm being unfair:In the year 2200, Switzerland will try to join the rest of the civillized world and tentatively try to open a store on Sundays as well. But first there must be a referendum.Woman: ""A cow died so you could eat that hamburger.""Man:  ""Next time I will not leave witnesses.""Teacher: ""Who was the first man?""Student: ""William Tell.""Teacher: ""That is incorrect.

Let us hope that the 2 season tv series will emerge on  bluray also in the future.I will NEVER forget the film's  finale - a true hysterically funny classic.,5,THE FUNNIEST FILM OF ALL TIME?,1346198400,"08 29, 2012",2012,607,"['film', 'version', 'hugely', 'popular', 'TV', 'series', 'Netherlands', 'unlikely', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'funnier', 'film', 'life.It', 'very', 'crude', 'touches', 'taboo', 'subjects', 'nudity', 'lot', 'good', 'fun', 'laugh', 'aloud', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'comedy', 'only', 'American', 'screenplay', 'writers', 'could', 'write', 'comedy', 'as', 'brilliant', 'film', 'final', 'scene', 'film', 'perhaps', 'funniest', 'scene', 'time', 'comedy', 'Let', 'hope', '2', 'season', 'tv', 'series', 'will', 'emerge', 'bluray', 'also', 'future.I', 'will', 'NEVER', 'forget', 'film', 'finale', 'true', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'classic']",N/A

I love watching a foreign movie whenever American cinema begins to bore me.  What this movie lacks in working comedy it more than makes up for in its ability to shock and surprise you.  You want to laugh at so much of this film but so much is so risque compared to what american audiences are used to that all you can do is smile (if you can handle the adult euro humor) and wait to see what this film pulls off next.  The characters seem awkward at first but they do grow on you.  The story is not necessarily new ground (think Big Daddy mixed with some About a Boy).  In short, this film will not bore you, and it is daring in it's approach to make you smile if not laugh.  Either way it will definitely be one people will talk about.... if they ever see it. ;)",4,"Don't be a klown, watch this now...",1353024000,"11 16, 2012",2012,893,"['Even', 'front', 'cover', 'film', 'was', 'NOT', 'funniest', 'film', 'year', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'love', 'watching', 'foreign', 'movie', 'whenever', 'American', 'cinema', 'bore', 'What', 'movie', 'working', 'comedy', 'more', 'up', 'ability', 'shock', 'surprise', 'want', 'laugh', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'risque', 'compared', 'what', 'american', 'audiences', 'are', 'used', 'can', 'do', 'smile', 'can', 'handle', 'adult', 'euro', 'humor', 'see', 'what', 'film', 'off', 'next', 'characters', 'seem', 'awkward', 'first', 'do', 'grow', 'story', 'not', 'necessarily', 'new', 'ground', 'think', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'mixed', 'Boy', 'short', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'bore', 'daring', 'approach', 'make', 'smile', 'not', 'laugh', 'way', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'one', 'people', 'will', 'talk', 'ever', 'see']",N/A
