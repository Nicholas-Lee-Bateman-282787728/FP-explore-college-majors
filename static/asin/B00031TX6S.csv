854478,AOB5695UUUJ0,B00031TX6S,"Anime Lover ""D""","[1, 1]","I will not go over what has been said be other people.  A story about a young man who has a disease that makes him fell like he is out of a different time.  A chance meeting near the lake with a young woman from outer space.  And when the young woman becomes his teacher, this starts the wheels moving forward.  When he learns of her secret and he tells her of his secret, what else is there to do, so he marries her (its okay, he is 18 and she is an alien).  As the new couple start their new lives together they learn that not everything is golden.  And when a classmate tries to steal Kei away from Mizuho, the two of them must learn to trust each other so their love and marriage will develop even when things look the darkest.This is a true legend of anime, if you are looking for a more adult driven series keep looking (of course episode 13 is more adult than the rest of the series, and very funny).  This is a well written story, with good humor, and good characters.  I also enjoyed the manga as well and while there were a few changes to the story (especially with the relationships of the friends) it stayed true.  a must have for any collection.",5,It is a true Legend for anime fame,1304899200,"05 9, 2011",2011,1158,"['will', 'not', 'go', 'over', 'been', 'said', 'be', 'other', 'people', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'disease', 'fell', 'different', 'time', 'chance', 'meeting', 'lake', 'young', 'woman', 'outer', 'space', 'when', 'young', 'woman', 'teacher', 'wheels', 'moving', 'forward', 'When', 'secret', 'secret', 'what', 'else', 'there', 'do', 'okay', '18', 'alien', 'new', 'couple', 'start', 'new', 'lives', 'together', 'learn', 'not', 'everything', 'golden', 'when', 'classmate', 'tries', 'steal', 'Kei', 'away', 'Mizuho', 'two', 'must', 'learn', 'trust', 'other', 'so', 'love', 'marriage', 'will', 'develop', 'even', 'when', 'things', 'look', 'darkest.This', 'true', 'legend', 'anime', 'are', 'looking', 'more', 'adult', 'driven', 'series', 'keep', 'looking', 'course', 'episode', '13', 'more', 'adult', 'rest', 'series', 'very', 'funny', 'well', 'written', 'story', 'good', 'humor', 'good', 'characters', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'manga', 'as', 'well', 'were', 'few', 'changes', 'story', 'especially', 'relationships', 'friends', 'stayed', 'true', 'must', 'have', 'collection']",Please Teacher!

Mizuho Kazami is an alien sent by something called the Galaxy Federation to observe the Earth. She becomes a teacher as her cover while observing. But when she landed, her cover was blowned when she was spotted by Kei Kusanagi, a boy in the class she teaches. Unlike his teacher, Kei has secret of his own. He is 18 year old with the body of a 15 year old. This is due to the fact that Kei has rare disorder which he calls a ""standstill"" which kept him in a coma and stunted his growth for the next three years. When the two accidentally got locked in a storage shed, they both shared their secrets. When they were rescued, the principal looked at the misunderstanding as a teacher and a student meeting in secret. Before the truth was spoken, Kei uncle told the principal that the two were married and they do get married for real. The principal asked Mizuho and Kei to keep their marriage a secret until Kei graduates from school. I won't go into anymore detail. If you want to know more, watch this and find out for yourself.

A friend had recommended it to me and I figured that I'd give it a try.The story of alien girl meets boy isn't a new one, but the little extras are what makes this story unique. What makes this series so good is that not only is the high school boy subject to a mysterious disease that causes him to fall into a coma & not age, but the two characters don't spend a lot of time dancing around each other.

I took their advice because I really enjoyed reading his review on Elfen Lied.  He said if you liked Elfen Lied you would enjoy this series.  He was wrong I really did not feel anything like I felt when watching Elfen Lied.  Now if you like anime are perverted and have the sexual maturity of a 15 year high school boy then this is the series for you.  This series is basically the dream of every high school boy with a hot teacher.  I have been there and I am sure that may of the males reading this review have been there as well.  Anyways if you want a series with a good storyline then this is not for you.  The writers who wrote the script need to get another job because script was mediocre to say the least.  I spent 27 dollars on this series with shipping and I might as well have burned the money.  I could write a better storyline than this one in less than a month in fact I have no doubt I could.  I'm just saying it would be best to spend your money on something else rather than this series.

854487,A3FIKATQ286DMV,B00031TX6S,Niko,"[33, 36]","For these series I have to say that it is truly very enjoyable. To make the long story short, it is about the relation of a young boy who falls in love with his female teacher and `vies versa' and the problems that they encounter. Additionally, it is getting very funny when they try to keep their relation as a secret.Well, thing is that:a) The teacher is an alienb) Her mother had a relationship with his fatherc) The alien nation will try at some point do stop the relationship and their relationship will be testedd) The teacher's mother in contrast to the teacher, is very corny and not shy at alle) The teacher has a little sister that resembles the little sister of the series called `Oh my Goddess' (if I remember the title correctly)f) Having watched both shows, the present one and `Oh my Goddess', I can safely conclude that both shows have many similarities - referring to the basis of the storyline - but still both of them are unique in their own wayg) It is a teenage comedy and how teenagers act and react when they encounter their first love situation, how life is in school etc.h) At some points the series imply sex and are a little bit nude (but still, over 12 year old children can watch the shows)i) However (Spoiler Included!!!): In one of the last episodes the series show something like a soft sex scene between teacher and the young student (Personally, I would have no problem with that but it is up to parents to decide).j) Overall, it is a very enjoyable and funny series, interesting, a mix of romance and drama. Personally, I liked the series a lot and that is why I can recommend the shows beyond any doubt.k) With this price you get all the shows and it is cheaper than buying them separately.As a `footnote', I preferred to write my review in a bullet-like style so that the reader will get easily a good general picture of the shows without giving too much away.

What that package doesn't tell you is behind the questionable concept is a thoughtfully told story of two interesting people caught up in an unusual situation. Both of these characters, Kei Kusanagi and his teacher Mizuho Kazami are complex individuals, each with a secret that both brings about and also complicates their relationship. In spite of the unusual premise, this story is neither kinky nor simple. It's just two good people trying to adapt to each other. There are a lot of complex emotions at work here, and it's not necessarily the most fun I've had watching anime, but the whole story is so lovely, I left this series with a great feeling.That said, I must acknowledge that the final episode was somewhat gratuitous, and sort of left one with the feeling of having gotten too much information. But I certainly wouldn't hold that against this wonderful show.

This is one of those series that proves my point.  I am far from being a fan of typical romantic comedy fare as that particular genre of entertainment is beyond stale and redundant here in America, but I have found that anime has so much more to offer than just sex, violence, fantastic sci-fi, and over-the-top slapstick humor.  There are some damn fine, truly romantic and touching stories in the anime genre, and this is one of them.  While ""Love Hina"" and other romantic-comedy anime series' have tempered their softer side with outrageous humor and outlandish characters to make their stories more, well, more anime-ish, ""Please Teacher"" shows remarkable restraint and -in spite of the teacher from outer space angle- keeps the sci-fi very light, the humor low-key and character-based, and takes a subtler approach to most of the characters that really helps to bring each of them to life.  The engrossing story features many plot twists that you would never expect since so many series are content to run in place for fear of upsetting their fanbases *cough*RanmaInuyasha*cough*.  One of the aspects of this series that really adds depth to the plot is the main character's unique ""disease"".  When Kei becomes sad, he enters a comatose state of suspended animation -sometimes for years at a time- where he goes into his own mind to escape from the sadness he finds in his life.  Through his experiences with his friends and, of course, his new teacher who through a bizarre set of circumstances he's forced to ""marry"" (Ms. Kazami, possibly the most charming anime girl ever) he learns that there is no happiness without sadness for contrast, and that even if he stands still the universe will keep moving without him.  These sorts of ideas and the way they are presented as integral parts of the story are what separate true classics from the throwaway entertainment crop.  It also doesn't hurt that the characters in the story are truly likeable.  Ms. Kazami's trademark phrase is hardly catchy (""This is priority one"") but her delivery of the line (in Japanese, anyways) makes it a pleasure to hear over and over, and don't get me started on her chocolate candystick habit. These sorts of minor nuances make the difference between the characters you enjoy and the characters you truly feel for.  The series ran for a far-too-short 12 episodes, but we are treated to a joyous epilogue that turns out to be the funniest episode of the whole series and really left me feeling happy that I'd given this show a try.  If you enjoyed ""Love Hina"", ""Ah! My Goddess"", or ""Chobits"", if you are looking for an anime that's both inspirational and humorous, if you've seen enough of the giant robots, killer ninjas, and obnoxious slapstick humor that pervades more typical anime, or if you just want to enjoy a sweet, romantic story with some feeling and depth, then this is exactly what you are looking for.",5,A true credit to the anime genre,1167955200,"01 5, 2007",2007,3031,"[""'ve"", 'long', 'held', 'opinion', 'matter', 'what', 'sort', 'film', 'television', 'shows', 'enjoy', 'anime', 'out', 'there', 'one', 'series', 'point', 'am', 'far', 'being', 'fan', 'typical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'fare', 'particular', 'genre', 'entertainment', 'stale', 'redundant', 'here', 'America', 'have', 'found', 'anime', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'offer', 'just', 'sex', 'violence', 'fantastic', 'sci-fi', 'over-the-top', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'are', 'damn', 'fine', 'truly', 'romantic', 'touching', 'stories', 'anime', 'genre', 'one', 'Love', 'Hina', 'other', 'romantic-comedy', 'anime', 'series', 'have', 'tempered', 'softer', 'side', 'outrageous', 'humor', 'outlandish', 'characters', 'make', 'stories', 'more', 'well', 'more', 'anime-ish', 'Please', 'Teacher', 'remarkable', 'restraint', '-in', 'spite', 'teacher', 'outer', 'space', 'angle-', 'sci-fi', 'very', 'light', 'humor', 'low-key', 'character-based', 'subtler', 'approach', 'most', 'characters', 'really', 'bring', 'life', 'engrossing', 'story', 'features', 'many', 'plot', 'twists', 'would', 'never', 'expect', 'so', 'many', 'series', 'are', 'content', 'run', 'place', 'fear', 'upsetting', 'fanbases', '*cough*RanmaInuyasha*cough*', 'One', 'aspects', 'series', 'really', 'depth', 'plot', 'main', 'character', 'unique', 'disease', 'When', 'Kei', 'sad', 'comatose', 'state', 'suspended', 'animation', '-sometimes', 'years', 'time-', 'where', 'own', 'mind', 'escape', 'sadness', 'life', 'experiences', 'friends', 'course', 'new', 'teacher', 'who', 'bizarre', 'set', 'circumstances', 'forced', 'marry', 'Ms.', 'Kazami', 'possibly', 'most', 'charming', 'anime', 'girl', 'ever', 'happiness', 'sadness', 'contrast', 'even', 'still', 'universe', 'will', 'keep', 'moving', 'sorts', 'ideas', 'way', 'are', 'presented', 'integral', 'parts', 'story', 'are', 'what', 'separate', 'true', 'classics', 'throwaway', 'entertainment', 'crop', 'also', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'characters', 'story', 'are', 'truly', 'likeable', 'Ms.', 'Kazami', 'trademark', 'phrase', 'hardly', 'catchy', 'priority', 'one', 'delivery', 'line', 'Japanese', 'pleasure', 'hear', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'started', 'chocolate', 'candystick', 'habit', 'sorts', 'minor', 'nuances', 'make', 'difference', 'characters', 'enjoy', 'characters', 'truly', 'feel', 'series', 'ran', 'far-too-short', '12', 'episodes', 'are', 'treated', 'joyous', 'epilogue', 'out', 'be', 'funniest', 'episode', 'whole', 'series', 'really', 'left', 'feeling', 'happy', ""'d"", 'given', 'show', 'try', 'enjoyed', 'Love', 'Hina', 'Ah', 'Goddess', 'Chobits', 'are', 'looking', 'anime', 'inspirational', 'humorous', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'enough', 'giant', 'robots', 'killer', 'ninjas', 'obnoxious', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'more', 'typical', 'anime', 'just', 'want', 'enjoy', 'sweet', 'romantic', 'story', 'feeling', 'depth', 'then', 'exactly', 'what', 'are', 'looking']",Please Teacher!

I've been exploring Anime for a while. You can see some of my other reviews if you like. As far as stories go, I like my love stories sentimental and corny. I think sometimes we could use a little more of that. This show isn't for everyone, but I enjoyed it thoroughly. I recommend that if you're a parent that you watch it yourself before you let anyone under 13 watch it, especially episode 13. It's a little too racy for the very young, but it isn't over the top like Hentai or anything like that. It's an older woman younger/man love story. Kei is technically a man, being 18 years old--even though he's pretending to be younger in order to fit in at school. Miss Kazami is 22 as I remember, so it's not that far fetched. My wife is very nearly ten years younger than I am. It just so happened that they came up with a clever way to explain that within the confines of the story.The bottom line is, that I set my sense of reality aside when I watched this. Watching anime is meant to take you away from reality on a little trip no and again. This one was an enjoyable one and it kind of reminded me of Weird Science, and Mannequin and all those other feel good 80s movies we're so fond of. Sure, the story doesn't stand up to close scrutiny but again, that's not why I chose to watch it. It made me smile, and that's the important thing. I definitely enjoyed the trip.",5,Set aside reality for a while and enjoy the ride.,1267401600,"03 1, 2010",2010,1483,"[""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'everything', 'been', 'covered', 'reviews', 'here', ""n't"", 'Dragonball', 'Shuffle', 'Air', 'TV', ""'ve"", 'been', 'exploring', 'Anime', 'while', 'can', 'see', 'other', 'reviews', 'like', 'As', 'far', 'stories', 'go', 'like', 'love', 'stories', 'sentimental', 'corny', 'think', 'sometimes', 'could', 'use', 'little', 'more', 'show', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'enjoyed', 'thoroughly', 'recommend', ""'re"", 'parent', 'watch', 'let', 'anyone', '13', 'watch', 'especially', 'episode', '13', 'little', 'too', 'racy', 'very', 'young', ""n't"", 'top', 'Hentai', 'anything', 'older', 'woman', 'younger/man', 'love', 'story', 'Kei', 'technically', 'man', 'being', '18', 'years', 'old', 'even', 'pretending', 'be', 'younger', 'order', 'fit', 'school', 'Miss', 'Kazami', '22', 'remember', 'not', 'far', 'fetched', 'wife', 'very', 'nearly', 'ten', 'years', 'younger', 'am', 'just', 'so', 'happened', 'came', 'up', 'clever', 'way', 'explain', 'confines', 'story.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'set', 'sense', 'reality', 'when', 'watched', 'Watching', 'anime', 'meant', 'take', 'away', 'reality', 'little', 'trip', 'again', 'one', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'kind', 'reminded', 'Weird', 'Science', 'Mannequin', 'other', 'feel', 'good', '80s', 'movies', ""'re"", 'so', 'fond', 'Sure', 'story', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', 'close', 'scrutiny', 'again', 'not', 'why', 'chose', 'watch', 'made', 'smile', 'important', 'thing', 'definitely', 'enjoyed', 'trip']",Please Teacher!
