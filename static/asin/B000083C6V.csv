If you want clever humor, or even jokes that make sense more often than not, look elsewhere. First of all, the cast and premise are shamelessly lifted from the Simpsons. Its almost pathetic, a fat dopey dad, a nagging wife, a brother sister and a baby...where have I seen that in cartoon form before? The majority of the plots are just pretext for Peter's stupid mugging and most of the jokes either fall flat, make no sense, or get a couple of cheap laughs. The show tries to ""push the envelope"" but it just comes out boring. The episodes usually contain some totally inane cut scene that has nothing to do with anything other than trying to get a few more laughs out of the morons who thing MTV is substantive. People who watch this show and think it's coherent need to turn off the TV and read an actual book with an actual plot. That being said, Stewie is the shows only saving grace, since he is the only character who is not either a total retread of something we have already seen 100 times or a cardboard cutout. His espisodes are actually clever since they don't focus on Peter falling down, getting drunk or farting. If you want a show with clever jokes, watch The Simpsons. If you want a show that has a semblence of a plot or an attempt at an actual message, watch South Park. If you are a dope with zero attention span who likes meaningless 30 second sound bites, this is the DVD for you.",2,"Occasionally  funny, mostly just stupid",1078617600,"03 7, 2004",2004,1468,"['bought', 'DVDs', 'high', 'expectations', 'were', 'not', 'met', 'want', 'clever', 'humor', 'even', 'jokes', 'make', 'sense', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'First', 'all', 'cast', 'premise', 'are', 'shamelessly', 'lifted', 'Simpsons', 'almost', 'pathetic', 'fat', 'dopey', 'dad', 'nagging', 'wife', 'brother', 'sister', 'baby', 'where', 'have', 'seen', 'cartoon', 'form', 'majority', 'plots', 'are', 'just', 'pretext', 'Peter', 'stupid', 'mugging', 'most', 'jokes', 'fall', 'flat', 'make', 'sense', 'get', 'couple', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'show', 'push', 'envelope', 'just', 'out', 'boring', 'episodes', 'usually', 'contain', 'totally', 'inane', 'cut', 'scene', 'nothing', 'do', 'anything', 'other', 'trying', 'get', 'few', 'more', 'morons', 'who', 'thing', 'MTV', 'substantive', 'People', 'who', 'watch', 'show', 'think', 'coherent', 'need', 'turn', 'off', 'TV', 'read', 'actual', 'book', 'actual', 'plot', 'being', 'said', 'Stewie', 'shows', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'only', 'character', 'who', 'not', 'either', 'total', 'retread', 'something', 'have', 'already', 'seen', '100', 'times', 'cardboard', 'cutout', 'espisodes', 'are', 'actually', 'clever', 'do', ""n't"", 'focus', 'Peter', 'falling', 'down', 'getting', 'drunk', 'farting', 'want', 'show', 'clever', 'jokes', 'watch', 'Simpsons', 'want', 'show', 'semblence', 'plot', 'attempt', 'actual', 'message', 'watch', 'South', 'Park', 'are', 'dope', 'zero', 'attention', 'span', 'who', 'meaningless', '30', 'second', 'sound', 'bites', 'DVD']","Family Guy, Volume One"

732550,AMP7TQRWAIE84,B000083C6V,"Adrian Cooper ""That Guy from Venus. :D""","[0, 0]","This show is one of the funniest on Adult Swim. It now shows on Fox, and another channel, The CW, formerly known as the WB, which hosted some of my favorite tv shows: From Animaniacs and What I Like About You to 8 Simple Rules For Dating My Teenage Daughter and Jerry Springer (Yes, as embarrassing as it is to admit, I was once a fan for a few months or so. But don't remind me!).The main characters are Peter Griffin, Chris Griffin, Lois Griffin, Brian  (the white pup), Stewie Griffin and last but not least, Meg Griffin who is tortured and put down by nearly everyone, especially her main family! Oh, joy!This cartoon comedy takes place in a fictitious place in Quahog, Rhode Island and the script was finished in 1999, by the uberly awesome, Seth Green, and originally produced for Fox.Peter is very funny, but he holds a somewhat considerate and compromising character, especially when it comes to his dear wife, Lois. Chris Griffin is a douche bag, to be put lightly. He's pretty clueless, likes to play with his pathetic little ""paddle ball"" thing, and thinks about how sad his non-existent sex life is! LOL He also has hinted at being confused at best with his sexuality. I think this has been made clear in 1 or 2 episodes. Once in a while though, when he's not being threatened by the Evil Monkey that scarily points to him from his closet, he manages to spew some thought-provoking knowledge to his parents, and sometimes to Meg.Meg is the unlucky sister of Chris, and the daughter to the hilariously heavy-weight, Peter and the level-headed and overworked mother, Lois. She spends her days trying to fit in and be ""one of the guys"", but seldom does it work! As far as we know, she has had one boyfriend, and it probably lasted a short, short time. He was a loser anyway! She's relatively smart, but is highly ignored and unaccepted. Next is Stewie, the baby. He is pretty evil when it comes to the way that his brain works. If he's not plotting plans to dominate the majority of the world, he's conjuring a plan to kill his mother, Lois. Stewie talks, but for the most part, it seems that no one really understands him. Lastly, Brian is the intelligent white dog, who also happens to be a smart-mouthed drunkard. It's sad how he falls out of chairs, and falls onto the floor half of the time, but strangely, any human, especially Stewie, understands every word he manages to mumble.This show is number 2 in comical relief to very few Adult Swim shows.

Yes, if you buy the Simpsons, you can get a discount on this second- (or third-) rate knockoff.I tried to give this show a chance, despite its already horrible premise. You have a fat, overweight, lackadaisical Everyman, his semi-reasonable wife, a smart daughter, a dumb son, a super-intelligent baby (with a disgusting 40-year-old voice) and a talking dog. The family would get into, and out of, ludicrous capers (which isn't necessarily bad - the Simpsons is often at its best in these moments; I mean, Homer becomes an astronaut?).However, where the family guy really runs afoul is in its horrible writing. Whereas the Simpsons often times tweaks popular culture and current events, the Family Guy runs over them with a sledgehammer. In fact, this show seems to want to be more South Park than the Simpsons, but is afraid to jump over the cliff in the profanity aspect. So instead, we are treated to mean-spirited jokes about Oprah Winfrey or the NBC network, which fail to amuse.I am surprised by the reviewer who claims this show is just ""too witty, shocking and satirical"" for American tastes. In fact, the Family didn't fail because of its shock content; in fact, most of America hardly batted an eye during its two (or maybe three, but who's counting?) season run. I remember reading a TV critic who lamented the Fox network's choice of ignoring a gold mine in Futurama, while continuing to run episodes of the sad-sack Family Guy.

Assuming this man must be his father, as someone like Peter couldn't be the father of such a genius, he takes Brian out on the road with him, on a cross country trip in Quagmire's RV, to find who he thinks is his long lost father. When he finally tracks this man down, however, he discovers it is his future self. Realizing what a loser he will become, Stewie rushes to try and fix up his future life, so he won't end up a 35 year old virgin with only one testicle.Now, aside from the fact that the movie moves at a snail's pace and takes forever to get to it's point, it just isn't half as funny as the show. Not quite sure why that is. Even the new, fourth season is still funny (although not quite as good as the ""Family Guy"" we knew in the past), but this ""movie"" just doesn't live up to the show. The best thing about ""Family Guy"" is that, if you don't like a joke, it doesn't matter, because there's another one coming around the corner. Here, they are few and far between, and often, quite unfunny. There is a lot of recycling used in this movie, a lot of jokes that have been done long ago, it makes me think that this movie is meant to appeal to people who have yet to pick up on the show. I honestly don't think this movie was a bad concept, but they easily could have compacted it into a normal 22 minute episode (afterall, nothing really happens in the first 22 minutes of this movie). Of all the jokes, sight-gags and whatnot, I'd say there are half a dozen funny ones (love that Stork gag). I think you really have to be a hardcore ""Family Guy"" fan to pick this DVD up.",3,Nothing You Haven't Seen Before...,1127779200,"09 27, 2005",2005,2260,"['Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'subject', 'line', 'fool', 'Yes', 'DVD', 'art', 'was', 'right', 'movie', 'never', 'actually', 'been', 'seen', 'damn', 'lot', 'jokes', 'sure', 'seem', 'familiar', 'eh', 'Stewie', 'Griffin', 'Untold', 'Story', 'who', 'else', 'Stewie', 'youngest', 'member', 'Griffin', 'family', 'arguably', 'most', 'popular', 'would', 'make', 'sense', 'were', 'do', 'hour', 'half', 'Family', 'Guy', 'movie', 'just', 'really', 'long', 'episode', 'should', 'star', 'Stewie', 'Remember', 'epsiode', 'Road', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'Deja', 'Vu', 'half', 'hour', 'going', 'almost', 'nowhere', 'only', 'one', 'funny', 'joke', 'Ew', 'band-aid', 'Stewie', 'man', 'television', 'who', 'remarkably', 'Assuming', 'man', 'must', 'be', 'father', 'someone', 'Peter', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'father', 'such', 'genius', 'out', 'road', 'cross', 'country', 'trip', 'Quagmire', 'RV', 'find', 'who', 'long', 'lost', 'father', 'When', 'finally', 'man', 'down', 'however', 'future', 'self', 'Realizing', 'what', 'loser', 'will', 'become', 'Stewie', 'try', 'fix', 'up', 'future', 'life', 'wo', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', '35', 'year', 'old', 'virgin', 'only', 'one', 'testicle.Now', 'aside', 'fact', 'movie', 'snail', 'pace', 'forever', 'get', 'point', 'just', ""n't"", 'half', 'as', 'funny', 'show', 'Not', 'quite', 'sure', 'why', 'Even', 'new', 'fourth', 'season', 'still', 'funny', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'Family', 'Guy', 'knew', 'past', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'show', 'best', 'thing', 'Family', 'Guy', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'joke', ""n't"", 'matter', 'one', 'coming', 'corner', 'Here', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'often', 'quite', 'unfunny', 'lot', 'recycling', 'used', 'movie', 'lot', 'jokes', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'long', 'ago', 'think', 'movie', 'meant', 'appeal', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'yet', 'pick', 'up', 'show', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'bad', 'concept', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'compacted', 'normal', '22', 'minute', 'episode', 'afterall', 'nothing', 'really', 'first', '22', 'minutes', 'movie', 'jokes', 'sight-gags', 'whatnot', ""'d"", 'say', 'are', 'dozen', 'funny', 'ones', 'love', 'Stork', 'gag', 'think', 'really', 'have', 'be', 'hardcore', 'Family', 'Guy', 'fan', 'pick', 'DVD', 'up']","Family Guy, Volume One"

I never thought that I would see a show rival that of the Simpsons in my lifetime, but here we have Seth MacFarlane's exceptional series, The Family Guy.  The epitome of the American family, Peter helms the show with the goofball humor that you normally finding yourself laughing at in your own film.  The rest of the characters truly give 100% for each episode, with young Stewie emerging as an ultimate favorite.  It is impressive when a television program can take social issues and realistic moments and twist them into humorous antidotes about life and family.  I think that is what is most important about this program is the ""wholesome"" family values that it promotes.  While it may not demonstrate at the beginning of each program, by the end it really drives home the power of the American family.  For those that may not see this, I loved this show.  I couldn't get enough of it when it was on television, so I went ahead and bought the series, and it is the best purchase I have ever made.  I just finished watching this first compilation for the tenth time and cannot wait to rewatch again.

I first discovered this gem on dvd... I had previously watched one or two episodes on fox, but because of the edgy material fox put the show on at crazy times, and never stuck to a schedual.  But since the show has been released on dvd a huge fan following has appeared over night and rightfully so!Family Guy has the normal cartoon (simpsons) make-up the oaft of a dad, loveable as always is Peter Griffen.  Peter is one of my favorite characters.  Lois Griffen is the glue that holds the family together.  Chris Griffen is the troublesome son.  Meg Griffen is the self-conscious daughter.  But family guy has some unique characters as well Brian, the talking dog, is absolutely hilarious and is Peter's complete opposite.  Funnily enough, Brian is the intellectual character and always has some profound comment on any subject!  And of course Stewie.  How can you forget Stewie.... the bond villian like baby who is obsessed with killing his own mother!!  All of these core characters and of course the numerous other hilarious ones Joe, Loretta, Clevland, and Quagmire--giggidy giggidy make for one hilarious, edgy, and just flat out funny television programNo review would be complete without mentioning the one element that makes family guy what it is.  The cut scenes.. that time when a character says remember when... or I've been there... and then the viewer is swooped to different scene often with an hilarious outcome!!  Every episode is great... there is no way to pick a favorite... there is a moment in every episode where I was laughing so hard it hurt!!  Every time I pop one of these dvds in keep thinking why couldn't I have come up with this!!  The writers on this show are the best around!!!

Every joke in this show comes from something else; Family Guy can't come up with any jokes of its own. This show is just terrible. Like I said, no originality, horrible story writing, and pathetic episodes are what a show needs to suck. That's what Family Guy is. A real show is a show like The Simpsons, where their jokes ARE relevant to the plot, the stories ARE interesting and creative, and the originality is GREAT. Sure, the show may have gotten a little less awesome, but the show is still great. Family Guy just needs to stop. This is a Simpsons rip-off with a few more dirty jokes. Who cares? Anybody at any age can easily make up a joke like that and make anybody laugh. The Simpsons on the other hand has sticked to its roots since episode one and still does well; proving that a show doesn't have to be funny by swearing or using sex jokes. Family Guy is a pathetic show. A show that sucks beyond all belief. A show that in no way at all should be used in the same sentence as the phrase ""The Simpsons"" and ""Great"".

I'm one of those evil people who carps and moans about how Family Guy is nowhere near as good as it was before it went off the air. Sorry. It's decline reminds me somewhat of the Simpsons' decline but much faster.I loved the old Family Guy episodes. Episodes like ""And The Weiner Is...,"" ""Love Thy Trophy,"" ""Thin White Line/Brian Does Hollywood,"" ""I Am Peter Hear Me Roar,"" and ""Peter Peter, Caviar Eater,"" among a ton of others, are among the funniest things I have seen on TV. So when I started watching it after it came back from cancellation, I was amazed at how the quality had sloughed off. When watching episodes like ""Blind Ambition,"" ""Breaking Out Is Hard To Do,"" ""Don't Make Me Over,"" and especially the painfully unfunny ""8 Simple Rules For Buying My Teenage Daughter,"" it's almost difficult to believe you're watching the same show.However, this movie is a respite from that disappointment. It's probably closer in quality to the old episodes than the new ones. As Martha Stewart says, ""That's a good thing.""So rejoice! This is something of a return to the good 'ol Family Guy in my opinion. Not the best of the best, but I'd rank it on the same level as older episodes like ""He's Too Sexy For His Fat"" and ""I Never Met The Dead Man.""The movie starts out with everyone in Quahog attending the premiere of the Family Guy movie. For anyone who says Family Guy can't be hilarious anymore, look at the joke about Stewie's ""failed political career."" Just as a visual gag alone it's hilarious. The joke with Lois and Peter ""get on!"" is more of the crassness they've been using lately that I usually don't like, but I actually found this funny. One guy I do with seeing a little less of is The Greased Up Deaf Guy. Losing his funny. However, the Evil Monkey gag (posing for the cameras) was great. So far, so good. Then we get into the actual movie.At the local community pool Stewie has a very funny near-death experience (Tom Allen channel-surfing - 'nuff said) that causes him to re-evaulate his behavior and become annoyingly nice. In the meantime, Peter gets angry because the local video chain has been taken over by Lackluster Video and has removed all the porn movies from the back room (which in itself is funny satire, I think; everywhere in the U.S. I've lived the local video chains have pornographic back rooms, but of course Blockbuster does not) and Tom Tucker hears him ranting about it, so he gives him a spot on the news where he can tell the public what ""grinds his gears.""From here of course, hilarity ensues and Stewie sets off on a cross-country trip when he sees a man who looks exactly like him (his real father?) being interviewed in San Francisco.Without giving away any more plot details, I have to say, to me, the beginning of the movie all the way until Stewie meets the man who looks like him is pretty good. The trip to San Francisco is quite amusing. And there's a very funny B story in which Peter and Lois teach Meg and Chris about dating and love (the funniest moment comes when Lois teaches Chris about dining out at a fine restaurant. You'll see, oh, you'll see). But the plot and the jokes when Stewie ""goes on his journey"" with the man kind of falls flat for me. The, ahem ""place where they go"" (trying not to spoil anything here) is not anywhere near as comedically fleshed out or full of the depth you'd hope. The twist with Meg really seems like pointless pandering for the legions of Meg haters. In short, when Stewie and the ""man who looks like him"" go to the ""other place"" I think the movie stalls badly. Brian's conversation with a few famous figures at this point is the high point.When Stewie returns the movie picks up again, and has it's most hilarious moment easily, the Ferris Bueller parody. Having been a child in the 80s, that really resonates with me. That's the funniest thing I've seen from Family Guy since they went off the air, hands down. Interestingly enough, in the commentary they note it was written for the episode ""Peter Griffin, Husband, Father, Brother?""After the movie, there's the after-premiere party, which isn't as funny as the beginning. It feels like they're trying to stretch the movie out to fit the minimum time for a movie.So, overall, I enjoyed the movie. Like with other Family Guy DVDs, the extras are nothing to write home about, at all. The commentary is fine, and I like the chaotic feel as commentators arrive and leave during the recording, and you get several interesting insights about the process of making the movie and what was going on when Family Guy was on hiatus, but it's a fairly standard Family Guy commentary.Overall, unless you're a die-hard Family Guy fan, I would recommend this for a video rental. After you've watched the movie, twice, with and without the commentary, and perused the few extras, in my opinion, you've gotten everything there is to be gotten out of this DVD - which is a good, enjoyable experience. But, unless you're a FG fanatic, I don't think this movie lends itself well to repeated viewing like the old Family Guy episodes you can watch 10 times or more.",4,A lukewarm but generally positive

732561,A2PUYMR4W89GUY,B000083C6V,Amanda,"[3, 4]","I used to think that ""South Park"" was the funniest, most original, most offensive show on television. And then, I saw ""Family Guy"". I remember watching it when it was still on the air and thinking how refreshing it was. You'd laugh for a full 22 minutes, and most of the time you'd feel guilty about it. Why? Because it pushed the envelope, most often just a little too far, and you couldn't help but think to yourself, ""I am going to hell for laughing at this."" But that's why it was so great.Unlike ""South Park"", ""Family Guy"" was a lot more mature. It didn't rely so much on potty humor and potty mouth, because it didn't have to. Just take, for instance, the family that we have here, the Griffins. There's Peter, the father and husband, who is a lot like Homer Simpson, only less yellow and with a bigger love for beer. He is lazy and not that bright. Then again, neither was Homer. Then there's Lois, the mother and wife who seems so normal and nice, you wonder why she's married to Peter. Then, there are the children: Chris, who is a bit chubby but kind-hearted and loves to draw; Meg who is a typical teenaged girl who wants to drive and get plastic surgery; and Stewie - the most complex character of all. He's just a little itty bitty baby, yet he speaks in an English accent, using big words, has a huge football-shaped head (probably to fit his large brain), likes to build complex machines such as time travelling ones, and - oh yeah - he wants to kill his mother. The biggest mystery about Stewie (one that's even been addressed in a couple of episodes, but never answered) is, can anyone hear him when he talks, other than the audience? The question goes unanswered, but we at least know that the family dog, Brian, hears him. Brian is another interesting character. He looks a bit like Snoopy, but that's where the similarities end. He likes to drink martinis, and he talks (he often is giving Peter sound advice - which Peter never takes). Every episode seems to find Peter trying to undo something bad that he did, but it never gets old. In fact, each of the 28 episodes are brilliant - there isn't a dud in the whole set.I remember the feeling I had when I found out that Fox had pulled ""Family Guy"" from their line-up. It really truly was the funniest show on television at the time, and it angered me that people were claiming it was offensive. But it doesn't matter now, because all of the episodes are coming out on DVD. Even if we aren't getting any new ones, the ones on the DVD can be viewed multiple times before they even start to get boring. You don't get much for special features here - pretty much just two commentaries each on each of the four discs. But you really don't need special features with a show this good. If you ever saw at least one episode and found yourself laughing, I strongly urge you to buy this DVD. The price is great for all that you get, which is hours of pure enjoyment. I guarentee you will not be disappointed.",5,It Really Doesn't Get Any Better Than This,1058572800,"07 19, 2003",2003,2969,"['used', 'think', 'South', 'Park', 'was', 'funniest', 'most', 'original', 'most', 'offensive', 'show', 'television', 'then', 'saw', 'Family', 'Guy', 'remember', 'watching', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'air', 'thinking', 'how', 'refreshing', 'was', ""'d"", 'laugh', 'full', '22', 'minutes', 'most', 'time', ""'d"", 'feel', 'guilty', 'Why', 'pushed', 'envelope', 'most', 'often', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'am', 'going', 'hell', 'laughing', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'great.Unlike', 'South', 'Park', 'Family', 'Guy', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'mature', 'did', ""n't"", 'rely', 'so', 'much', 'potty', 'humor', 'potty', 'mouth', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'Just', 'take', 'instance', 'family', 'have', 'here', 'Griffins', 'Peter', 'father', 'husband', 'who', 'lot', 'Homer', 'Simpson', 'only', 'less', 'yellow', 'bigger', 'love', 'beer', 'lazy', 'not', 'bright', 'Then', 'again', 'was', 'Homer', 'Then', 'Lois', 'mother', 'wife', 'who', 'so', 'normal', 'nice', 'wonder', 'why', 'married', 'Peter', 'Then', 'are', 'children', 'Chris', 'who', 'bit', 'chubby', 'kind-hearted', 'draw', 'Meg', 'who', 'typical', 'teenaged', 'girl', 'who', 'drive', 'get', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'Stewie', 'most', 'complex', 'character', 'just', 'little', 'itty', 'bitty', 'baby', 'yet', 'English', 'accent', 'using', 'big', 'words', 'huge', 'football-shaped', 'head', 'probably', 'fit', 'large', 'brain', 'build', 'complex', 'machines', 'such', 'time', 'travelling', 'ones', 'oh', 'yeah', 'kill', 'mother', 'biggest', 'mystery', 'Stewie', 'one', 'even', 'been', 'addressed', 'couple', 'episodes', 'never', 'answered', 'can', 'anyone', 'hear', 'when', 'other', 'audience', 'question', 'unanswered', 'least', 'know', 'family', 'dog', 'Brian', 'Brian', 'interesting', 'character', 'bit', 'Snoopy', 'where', 'similarities', 'end', 'drink', 'martinis', 'often', 'giving', 'Peter', 'sound', 'advice', 'Peter', 'never', 'episode', 'find', 'Peter', 'trying', 'undo', 'something', 'bad', 'did', 'never', 'old', 'fact', '28', 'episodes', 'are', 'brilliant', ""n't"", 'dud', 'whole', 'set.I', 'remember', 'feeling', 'had', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'Fox', 'had', 'pulled', 'Family', 'Guy', 'line-up', 'really', 'truly', 'was', 'funniest', 'show', 'television', 'time', 'angered', 'people', 'were', 'claiming', 'was', 'offensive', ""n't"", 'matter', 'now', 'episodes', 'are', 'coming', 'out', 'DVD', 'Even', 'are', ""n't"", 'getting', 'new', 'ones', 'ones', 'DVD', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'multiple', 'times', 'even', 'start', 'get', 'boring', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'special', 'features', 'here', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'two', 'commentaries', 'four', 'discs', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'special', 'features', 'show', 'good', 'ever', 'saw', 'least', 'one', 'episode', 'found', 'laughing', 'strongly', 'urge', 'buy', 'DVD', 'price', 'great', 'get', 'hours', 'pure', 'enjoyment', 'guarentee', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']","Family Guy, Volume One"

732571,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B000083C6V,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[3, 4]","While I did watch Family Guy occasionally when it was first on TV, I was never a fan until after it got cancelled.  In the interim period between the third and fourth (uncancelled) seasons, I discovered Seth MacFarlane's hilarious work.  It really pushed the envelope in terms of what the censors would allow as well as coming up with some of the most out-there plots imaginable (one of my favorites involves Peter seceeding from the Union).  When FOX decided to bring the show back, due to enormous DVD sales, I along with fans everywhere rejoiced at the news.However, when the first new episode aired, I was somewhat underwhelmed, and as the new season progressed, I found myself losing interest in the show.  So when the movie came out, I found that, while I did genuinely want to see it, I never rushed out to get it.  Finally, one of my neighbors held a small screening of it, and I found my faith in Family Guy renewed.One of my biggest problems with the new episodes is that they take jokes and concepts that worked in the original run and use them ad nauseum.  There are cutaways every minute now and jokes are drawn out for minutes at a time.  In the movie, there aren't any jokes that go on for too long (don't get me wrong, I do love it when they draw something out, but lately, they've gone on for too long), and while there are a lot of cutaways, they are all very funny (though there is one with Ray Charles that is a little distasteful, but then again, what isn't in good taste on this show?).Basically, the movie is three episodes that was going to be a three-parter in the series, but I guess that when FOX asked for a movie, they decided to slightly redo them and make them into a movie.  Also, they are bracketed by the characters attending a premiere of the movie.  The story begins with Stewie having a near-death experience in a swimming pool, and, thinking he ended up in Hell, decides to change his ways and be good.  When that doesn't work out, he wishes that he could find someone else out there who is like him.  All of the sudden, this guy appears in San Francisco who looks exactly like Stewie.  After being interviewed on television, Stewie and Brian set out to find the man Stewie believes to be his true father (after all, how could the dim-witted Peter share the same genes with maniacal Stewie?).  Of course, wackiness ensues as the pair hitch a ride with Quagmire and his (and I can't spell this the way it is in the movie) Cross-Country Tour.  However, when Stewie finally meets up with the man he is seeking, he is amazed to learn his true identity.While there are a few things about the movie I didn't like, overall it is great.  All of our favorite characters are here, but MacFarlane also introduces a few new people, including the Waving Arms Inflatible Tube Man in one of the funniest scenes of the movie.  This movie is sure to please Family Guy fans everywhere.  If you have never seen the show before, I reccomend this, but I want to issue a warning as well; the humor is extremely raunchy, so be expected to be caught off guard by a few things.  If you can get past that, be prepared to laugh long and hard.",4,"Funny, Raunchy, Fresh",1130544000,"10 29, 2005",2005,3153,"['did', 'watch', 'Family', 'Guy', 'occasionally', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'TV', 'was', 'never', 'fan', 'got', 'cancelled', 'interim', 'period', 'third', 'fourth', 'uncancelled', 'seasons', 'discovered', 'Seth', 'MacFarlane', 'hilarious', 'work', 'really', 'pushed', 'envelope', 'terms', 'what', 'censors', 'would', 'allow', 'as', 'well', 'coming', 'up', 'most', 'out-there', 'plots', 'imaginable', 'one', 'favorites', 'Peter', 'seceeding', 'Union', 'When', 'FOX', 'decided', 'bring', 'show', 'back', 'due', 'enormous', 'DVD', 'sales', 'along', 'fans', 'everywhere', 'rejoiced', 'news.However', 'when', 'first', 'new', 'episode', 'aired', 'was', 'somewhat', 'underwhelmed', 'new', 'season', 'progressed', 'found', 'losing', 'interest', 'show', 'So', 'when', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'found', 'did', 'genuinely', 'want', 'see', 'never', 'rushed', 'out', 'get', 'Finally', 'one', 'neighbors', 'held', 'small', 'screening', 'found', 'faith', 'Family', 'Guy', 'renewed.One', 'biggest', 'problems', 'new', 'episodes', 'take', 'jokes', 'concepts', 'worked', 'original', 'run', 'use', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'are', 'cutaways', 'minute', 'now', 'jokes', 'are', 'drawn', 'out', 'minutes', 'time', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'jokes', 'go', 'too', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'do', 'love', 'when', 'draw', 'something', 'out', 'lately', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'too', 'long', 'are', 'lot', 'cutaways', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'one', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'little', 'distasteful', 'then', 'again', 'what', ""n't"", 'good', 'taste', 'show', '.Basically', 'movie', 'three', 'episodes', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'three-parter', 'series', 'guess', 'when', 'FOX', 'asked', 'movie', 'decided', 'slightly', 'redo', 'make', 'movie', 'Also', 'are', 'bracketed', 'characters', 'attending', 'premiere', 'movie', 'story', 'Stewie', 'having', 'near-death', 'experience', 'swimming', 'pool', 'thinking', 'ended', 'up', 'Hell', 'change', 'ways', 'be', 'good', 'When', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'could', 'find', 'someone', 'else', 'who', 'sudden', 'guy', 'San', 'Francisco', 'who', 'exactly', 'like', 'Stewie', 'being', 'interviewed', 'television', 'Stewie', 'Brian', 'set', 'out', 'find', 'man', 'Stewie', 'be', 'true', 'father', 'how', 'could', 'dim-witted', 'Peter', 'share', 'same', 'genes', 'maniacal', 'Stewie', 'course', 'wackiness', 'ensues', 'pair', 'hitch', 'ride', 'Quagmire', 'ca', ""n't"", 'spell', 'way', 'movie', 'Cross-Country', 'Tour', 'However', 'when', 'Stewie', 'finally', 'up', 'man', 'seeking', 'amazed', 'learn', 'true', 'identity.While', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'overall', 'great', 'favorite', 'characters', 'are', 'here', 'MacFarlane', 'also', 'few', 'new', 'people', 'including', 'Waving', 'Arms', 'Inflatible', 'Tube', 'Man', 'one', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'movie', 'movie', 'sure', 'please', 'Family', 'Guy', 'fans', 'everywhere', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'reccomend', 'want', 'issue', 'warning', 'as', 'well', 'humor', 'extremely', 'raunchy', 'so', 'be', 'expected', 'be', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'few', 'things', 'can', 'get', 'past', 'be', 'prepared', 'laugh', 'long', 'hard']","Family Guy, Volume One"

I was hesitant about buying the set however, because after reading a number of reviews, I had learned that the un-aired episode ""When You Wish Upon A Weinstein"" was not included.  Nonetheless, I made the purchase, and I'm glad I did!I just read an exclusive interview with Seth McFarlane on TVSHOWSONDVD.com and the ""Weinstein"" episode will DEFINITELY be on the upcoming Volume 2 set which will be released September 9th.  I suggest you check it out if you require confirmation.Now, back to this set.  I guess there's only one beef I have with this, and that would be that the Bin Laden joke was removed from the episode, ""Road To Rhode Island"".  I guess the execs at Fox deemed it inappropriate.  Aside from that, I couldn't ask for a better set.  2 episodes on each of the disks have been laced with optional commentary by McFarlane et al which provides insight into the making of the show which I found to be very insightful.It's a shame the show was so short-lived, but for those of you who want to re-live the episodes again and again, this is the perfect set to buy.

732578,A3OT6IQ0YHGDCB,B000083C6V,"ANT ""azraelart""","[0, 0]","The reason for my title was to assure folks that this is not just one elongated epsiode.  Although, you could make an argument that any television series that makes an hour-and-a-half offering is simply making a long episode, I suppose.  Still, there is a consistent plot running throughout, and as fans of Family Guy would expect, there are also numerous side stories and tangents throughout the movie.It seems that from what I can gather from people I know, they either love it, like it a lot, or hate it.  There isn't much of a middle ground.  One of the biggest reasons for hating it was the ending.  I will not spoil anything, but I will agree that I believe they try to wrap things up too quickly, when they certainly had time to drag it out for a while.  Then again, and this isn't a spoiler as you know from the beginning, the entire movie is set in the theme of the Griffins actually making a Family Guy movie, with a hilarious mock premiere opening and ending.  So, it is book-ended nicely, thereby attempting to explain any problems within the movie.I promised no spoilers, but I will say this: the film revolves primarily around Stewie (which makes sense, since he tests as the show's highest rated character).  You could probably guess that with the title ""Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story.""  Don't worry, some of the other characters get a good treatment throughout, although there really isn't a heck of a lot involving Chris or Meg.  The constant tangents and side stories and cameos from previous bit players fill many gaps that might have been in there from a lesser story.  Fans of the series, though, come to expect these vignettes and they will not be disappointed.I would like to also say that if you are reading this, you probably have heard something about it.  Well, I cannot change your opinion on anything, nor can I change your friends' opinions, but I will say this.

They say what they say and hope that people don't take them serious enough to laugh at some of the offensive things they do say. And this is what I love about the series. So when I heard the movie was coming out, I was excited, figuring that it would go beyond everything the series ever achieved.I was disappointed. Not only is this movie mild compared to the series today, but it's edited. You don't expect curse words to be edited in an unrated DVD. To add to that, it's not a true movie but actually a three part series connected only the by fact that they're about Stewie and his future. Before and after these three parts is a mostly pointless frame story. They didn't take advantage of the freedom of DVD releases. It was a disappointing effort. They should have taken the cue from the Southpark movie, and just have at it.I can recommend this to people who are true fans of the series, and only then if you're willing to accept this as an extra episode of Family Guy and not an actual movie. Also, I recommend it to people new to Family Guy, so that you can get a taste of what the series is about.",2,"""Mildly Entertained""",1137628800,"01 19, 2006",2006,1167,"['Family', 'Guy', 'known', 'not', 'really', 'caring', 'what', 'people', 'think', 'say', 'what', 'say', 'hope', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'serious', 'enough', 'laugh', 'offensive', 'things', 'do', 'say', 'what', 'love', 'series', 'when', 'heard', 'movie', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'was', 'excited', 'figuring', 'would', 'go', 'everything', 'series', 'ever', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Not', 'only', 'movie', 'mild', 'compared', 'series', 'today', 'edited', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'curse', 'words', 'be', 'edited', 'unrated', 'DVD', 'add', 'not', 'true', 'movie', 'actually', 'three', 'part', 'series', 'connected', 'only', 'fact', ""'re"", 'Stewie', 'future', 'three', 'parts', 'mostly', 'pointless', 'frame', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'advantage', 'freedom', 'DVD', 'releases', 'was', 'disappointing', 'effort', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'cue', 'Southpark', 'movie', 'just', 'have', 'it.I', 'can', 'recommend', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'true', 'fans', 'series', 'only', 'then', ""'re"", 'willing', 'accept', 'extra', 'episode', 'Family', 'Guy', 'not', 'actual', 'movie', 'Also', 'recommend', 'people', 'new', 'Family', 'Guy', 'can', 'get', 'taste', 'what', 'series']","Family Guy, Volume One"

It's Family Guy, a show that FOX first aired in 1999, Family Guy has been cancelled twice, last in 2002. Thankfully though the genuises at Cartoon Network cancelled that horrible show, ''Home Movies'' to make room for Family Guy reruns (it currently airs Sun-Thur as part of Adult Swim). When Family Guy was on FOX it was constantly being compared to the Simpsons, and in many cases called a Simpsons [imitation], but I don't think so. Since about 1998 (coincidentally the year before Family Guy aired) The Simpsons were running out of plot ideas, episodes started to get [weak] and relied on, ''The Simpsons go to (insert city) with special celebrity guest (inser name)!'' Family Guy took what The Simpsons started and brought it up a notch, for instance, the baby in the Simpsons has no personality and just sucks on a pacifer. The baby in Family Guy is an ... Genius bent on taking over the world. Another thing that makes Family Guy better than the Simpsons is all those hillarious flashbacks (you'll know what I mean after you see an episode). Also Family Guy has a funny New England flavor to it that makes it great to watch.

It was horribly reviewed by critics, and shuffled around on the schedule by FOX, who didn't seem to know exactly what to do with it. I have never seen a show, much less a cartoon, that pushed the envelope that much and that far. It's amazing with some of the things they got away with. The show comes from creator Seth McFarland, and it's a doozy of a program. The show centers around the wacky Griffin clan, who hail from Quahog, Rhode Island. Dad Peter is a round man who works for a toy company. The wife is Lois, and she is voiced by Alex Borstein, who folks may remember from her five seasons on &quot;Mad TV&quot;, where she had characters like Ms. Swan. Son Chris is rather rotund like his father. He isn't the sharpest kid either. He is voiced by Seth Green. Daughter Meg is short and wears glasses. The smart one of the family. She was originally voiced by &quot;Party Of Five&quot; star Lacey Chabert, but was then replaced by Mila Kunis, from &quot;That 70's Show&quot;. The family dog is Brian. He talks, behaves like a human, and is the most intellectual one of the  bunch. Finally, there is baby Stewie. Never has there been a character such has him. He is a maniacal little tot plotting world domination. I am constantly amazed by this character. There are a number of recurring characters in this zany cartoon world. Their neighbor, Quagmire, is one for the books. A real ladies man. There are a few more. Seth McFarland also contributes the voices for Peter, Brian, Stewie, Quagmire, and a few others. The show is knee slapping, fall down funny. This is something very rare in television comedy these days. It can be quite offensive at times, and you feel guilty and ashamed for even smiling at it. This 4 disc collection contains 28 episodes from the show's first first 2 seasons. Some of the gems you will find are - &quot;A Hero Sits Next Door&quot;, which has Peter planning a bank robbery for him to foil so he can be a hero like his wheelchair bound police officer neighbor. &quot;Brian In Love&quot; is another hysterical episode where Brian starts having accidents in the house. He goes to see a therapist and finds out he is in love with Lois. &quot;The King Is Dead&quot; is another riot as Lois takes over the local community theater and plans to do a production of &quot;The King And I&quot;, but then disaster strikes when Peter takes the show over. &quot;Road To Rhode Island&quot; is another classic. Brian goes to pick up Stewie from visiting his grandparents in Palm Springs, and the two have an adventure trying to get back home. There are a lot more great episodes here, but those are some of the best. Every one is funny. What is also cool about the show, is how it really stays spot on with pop culture. Either recent or in the past. Some of their references or visual gags dealing with this are brilliant. The characters are also incredibly well developed. Each one has their very own personality, tick, and demeanor. McFarland is incredibly talented in this area. He does the voices for so many of the main characters.

Let's think of the concept: a dumb, drunk, and irresponsible father, an insightful wife, a dumb son, a smart but unpopular daughter, a dog, and a baby, and a bunch of wild neighbors.  Doesn't sound anything like the Simpsons, now does it?Also, it's not funny.  I recently watched an episode cause my friend made me, and half the episode was taken up by Peter randomly fighting a chicken.  Why?  Because it's funny?  No, because it takes up half the episode, and the writers are not clever enough to fill up a 30 min. time slot w/ commercials with jokes that are relevant.  Which brings me to my next point: have you noticed how none of the jokes have anything to do with the plot?  Thats because they're stolen!Another thing is that the show is so intent on being offensive that it loses any humor it does have.  I'm not someone who is offended easily; the only thing that does is when something is vulgar for the sake of being vulgar, and Family Guy is indeed.

Aside from the Dog, it almost a character-for-character rip off of that classic series. The &quot;hook&quot; for this series was supposed to be that &quot;The Family Guy&quot; would push buttons that &quot;The Simpsons&quot; could only dream about, and they succeded at it. However, while &quot;The Simpsons'&quot; wit and great writing have prevented the characters (for the most part) from devolving into stereotypes; &quot;The Family Guy&quot; desperately tried to be more shocking with each episode and eventually collapsed under the weight of its own hype. In addition, simply because a show &quot;pushes buttons&quot; doesn't automatically make it funny. The true redeeming value of the Simpsons (and more recently South Park) is that the shows make you think and have dynamic characters that the viewer actually cares about while either dancing (or sometimes trampling) on &quot;the line&quot; of what's socially acceptable. &quot;The Family Guy,&quot; while containing some genuinely funny moments, simply could not compete with either the Simpsons or South Park. The deathblow to the show came with Fox's juggling of the time schedule (which ironically hurt the Simpsons ratings when they put it up against The Cosby Show in the 2nd season). However, the cult that surrounds this show still continues to be resilient online, thus resulting in the DVD's that have been recently released. My guess is that while &quot;The Simpsons&quot; will continue to age like a fine wine, &quot;The Family Guy&quot; will age like a can of Natural Light that goes flat when you open it and finally be tossed on the ash heap of history with the several other shows that were either good or ok and that were in some way or another Simpsons knock-offs (such as &quot;Duckman&quot; and &quot;Dinosaurs!&quot;).",2,Simpsons knock-off,1063065600,"09 9, 2003",2003,1906,"['Family', 'Guy', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'blatant', 'TV', 'shows', 'come', 'down', 'line', 'Simpson', 'Aside', 'Dog', 'almost', 'character-for-character', 'rip', 'classic', 'series', 'quot', 'hook', 'quot', 'series', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'quot', 'Family', 'Guy', 'quot', 'would', 'push', 'buttons', 'quot', 'Simpsons', 'quot', 'could', 'only', 'dream', 'succeded', 'However', 'quot', 'Simpsons', 'quot', 'wit', 'great', 'writing', 'have', 'prevented', 'characters', 'most', 'part', 'devolving', 'stereotypes', 'quot', 'Family', 'Guy', 'quot', 'desperately', 'tried', 'be', 'more', 'shocking', 'episode', 'eventually', 'collapsed', 'weight', 'own', 'hype', 'addition', 'simply', 'show', 'quot', 'pushes', 'buttons', 'quot', ""n't"", 'automatically', 'make', 'funny', 'true', 'redeeming', 'value', 'Simpsons', 'more', 'recently', 'South', 'Park', 'shows', 'make', 'think', 'have', 'dynamic', 'characters', 'viewer', 'actually', 'dancing', 'sometimes', 'trampling', 'quot', 'line', 'quot', 'what', 'socially', 'acceptable', 'quot', 'Family', 'Guy', 'quot', 'containing', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'moments', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'compete', 'Simpsons', 'South', 'Park', 'deathblow', 'show', 'came', 'Fox', 'juggling', 'time', 'schedule', 'ironically', 'hurt', 'Simpsons', 'ratings', 'when', 'put', 'up', 'Cosby', 'Show', '2nd', 'season', 'However', 'cult', 'show', 'still', 'be', 'resilient', 'online', 'thus', 'resulting', 'DVD', 'have', 'been', 'recently', 'released', 'guess', 'quot', 'Simpsons', 'quot', 'will', 'continue', 'age', 'fine', 'wine', 'quot', 'Family', 'Guy', 'quot', 'will', 'age', 'can', 'Natural', 'Light', 'flat', 'when', 'open', 'finally', 'be', 'tossed', 'ash', 'heap', 'history', 'several', 'other', 'shows', 'were', 'either', 'good', 'ok', 'were', 'way', 'Simpsons', 'knock-offs', 'such', 'quot', 'Duckman', 'quot', 'quot', 'Dinosaurs', 'quot']","Family Guy, Volume One"

732606,A1JEWNBAYDSQBO,B000083C6V,Bonnie Burton,"[3, 4]","Let me get one thing straight right off the bat: &quot;The Family Guy&quot; was one of the best animated comedies on the telly. It takes more risks at upseting the mainstream than &quot;The Simpsons&quot; but isn't so blatant in shock value as &quot;Southpark.&quot; In fact, I seriously loved this series when it was on the air and I'm thrilled that now that it's available on DVD, I can watch my favorite episodes whenever I want. If you're a fan of the show, you need these DVD box sets.However, if you want really cool added features, keep looking. Unlike the commentary for DVDs like &quot;The Simpsons&quot; it's almost as though Seth and gang have no idea what DVD commentary is for. In fact, for many of the episodes that actually DO have commentary, they sit in silence instead of actually commenting -- which kinda begs the question -- why is this called an audio commentary track when you barely comment?Also, many of the comments really aren't that entertaining at all. Occasionally Seth M. or Seth Green will speak in their characters' voices to comment (which would have been sooo much more interesting if they continued to do so) but for the most part they just don't say much.Highlights of the commentary do include the actress who does Lois' voice (she is damn funny).... but some of the other voice actors/actresses that are on the commentary seem to have been brought in at last minute. One of supporting voice actors even asks in geniune astonishment: &quot;Brian the dog has a martini?&quot;  Which makes you kind of wonder if some of the actors even bothered watching the series they were in while it aired.There's only one documentary (if you want to call it that) which is simply a long commercial for the show.I was disappointed in the bonus material, but the episodes themselves are worth the price of the box set. I just hope in the future, more people who bother with DVD commentary do something other than just sit in silence.",4,Amazing TV show -- sub par DVD bonus material,1062460800,"09 2, 2003",2003,1955,"['Let', 'get', 'one', 'thing', 'straight', 'right', 'bat', 'quot', 'Family', 'Guy', 'quot', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'animated', 'comedies', 'telly', 'more', 'risks', 'upseting', 'mainstream', 'quot', 'Simpsons', 'quot', ""n't"", 'so', 'blatant', 'shock', 'value', 'quot', 'Southpark.', 'quot', 'fact', 'seriously', 'loved', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'air', ""'m"", 'thrilled', 'now', 'available', 'DVD', 'can', 'watch', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'whenever', 'want', ""'re"", 'fan', 'show', 'need', 'DVD', 'box', 'sets.However', 'want', 'really', 'cool', 'added', 'features', 'keep', 'looking', 'commentary', 'DVDs', 'quot', 'Simpsons', 'quot', 'almost', 'Seth', 'gang', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'fact', 'many', 'episodes', 'actually', 'DO', 'have', 'commentary', 'sit', 'silence', 'instead', 'actually', 'commenting', 'kinda', 'question', 'why', 'called', 'audio', 'commentary', 'track', 'when', 'barely', 'comment', 'Also', 'many', 'comments', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'entertaining', 'Occasionally', 'Seth', 'M.', 'Seth', 'Green', 'will', 'speak', 'characters', 'voices', 'comment', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'sooo', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'continued', 'do', 'so', 'most', 'part', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'much.Highlights', 'commentary', 'do', 'include', 'actress', 'who', 'Lois', 'voice', 'damn', 'funny', 'other', 'voice', 'actors/actresses', 'are', 'commentary', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'brought', 'last', 'minute', 'One', 'supporting', 'voice', 'actors', 'even', 'geniune', 'astonishment', 'quot', 'Brian', 'dog', 'martini', 'quot', 'Which', 'kind', 'wonder', 'actors', 'even', 'bothered', 'watching', 'series', 'were', 'only', 'one', 'documentary', 'want', 'call', 'simply', 'long', 'commercial', 'show.I', 'was', 'disappointed', 'bonus', 'material', 'episodes', 'are', 'worth', 'price', 'box', 'set', 'just', 'hope', 'future', 'more', 'people', 'who', 'bother', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'do', 'something', 'other', 'just', 'sit', 'silence']","Family Guy, Volume One"

They had banked on Futurama being the hit show and Family Guy just being filler material until they decided to pull the plug and put another show with an awful concept in it's place.Even in the beginning, Family Guy got a bad wrap of being told it was nothing but a rip off of the Simpsons. And the Simpsons, who were obviously threatened by Family Guy's success took a shot at the show placing Peter Griffin in with Homer's reject clones.Fox obviously thought Family Guy had no chance of being a success.But they were absolutely wrong. Family Guy was a hit and Futurama was not the success they had hoped for. But they couldn't be wrong, so they did their best to sabotage Family Guy by placing the show in various timeslots where people would not watch it because of more popular shows on other channels. Until they decided to pull the plug on Family Guy and keep Futurama, despite the fact Futurama really was not that funny.I felt it was the Critic all over again.But Fox's loss has proven to be Cartoon Network's gain as they are now showing all the old episodes of Family Guy. And at it's 11:30pm timeslot (incidentally right after Futurama), it's beating out both Letterman and Leno in the ratings.And now I am very pleased to see that all of the first and second season have been released on video. With the last season to be released very soon.If you think the first two seasons were good, Family Guy only gets better by the last season. Funnier than the Simpon's have been for the longest time.But I am very happy to see Family Guy enjoying the success it deserves on Cartoon Network.I would highly recommend this DVD set.

I figured there'd be a lot of cussing due to the box screaming 'Uncensored', but no. I expected it to be funny every single second, but no. But what it all boils down to is whether you came in a Family Guy fan or not. If you'd never seen it then yes, you'll most likely love it. But if you're already a big fan then you'll probably see this as simply mediocre. I however, came in being a huge fan and came out liking Family Guy even more. I think if you go into watching this with no expectations you'll be pleasantly surprised. Afterall, The Untold Story merely plays as a three part episode. The first part revolves around Stewie's trials and tribulations with swimming and a near-death experience. The second follows Peter when he gets his own segment on the local news called 'What Grinds My Gears.' And the third part follows Stewie as he tries to find his long-lost father, with an added twist. But don't think that it stops with those ideas, no, we get to see Meg as a guy named Ron, Chris as a cop, Peter in all his idiotic glory, Lois as a drunken sex kitten, Stewie get drunk, and Brian, well, be himself. This movie should be everything a Family Guy fan would love. The jokes are more raunchy and you get to hear your favorite characters cussing, what more can you ask for?I for one loved every second Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story had to offer. I thought every joke was right on with what would've been in a regular episode and even at times surpassed what would've been. It was even refreshing to see the characters you know from the show make fun of the movie once it ended.

Often when a TV series makes a movie it tries to encompass the whole run of a series, or provide some over-arcing storyline. Not true with the Family Guy movie. It was basically just a really long episode (3 to be exact- and all from different writers), but it flowed together just like a regular half hour show- which means random stories regularly interrupted by irrelevant montages and asides- you know, what makes it so great.Its also no worse than what they show on regular network TV- I'm not sure what the big UNCENSORED deal is.My favorite part was the opener- the news leading up to a red carpet opener. Very fun.The Special Features are lame previews and of course, the now standard commentary. But they did include a neat trick where you can watch the whole thing as a sketched cartoon side by side with the fully animated version. That was cool for about... 5 minutes.I definitely recommend watching this, but if you're debating between buying this and buying a season of shows on DVD- buy the season.

Family Guy has the same old-fashioend sitcom core that has worked for generations - a stupid but well-meaning dad and his zany family - but adds a huge dose of ridiculous unreality to the mix. The show makes heavy use of random cutaways that exist for no other purpose but to be funny. It also holds nothing sacred, willingly making jokes at anything, even itself. Admittedly, this humor is not for everyone. If you can appreciate a dose of the ridiculous, though, Family Guy is solid gold.This volume contains the first two seasons of Family Guy, which gets the show off and running quickly. You'll get a feel from the very first episode, where we start off with a talking dog, an evil maniacal baby, and a cutaway to a joke about Hitler's low self-esteem. If you can see how that can be fun, this DVD volume is for you.While I'm usually not keen on commentary or other goodies in a DVD, the commentary tracks on this set are very good and worth listening to if you're curious about the history of the show. Family Guy had a tumultuous relationship with Fox, leading to some severe censoring and eventual cancellation. The creators give some insight as to what was going on behind the scenes but are thankfully unbiased, taking as many shots at themselves as the network. Such matters are merely footnotes, however.

No offense to such award winners as The Sopranos, The West Wing and Six Feet Under to name a few, but this show had everything.  It was comical and satirical, sardonic and irreverent.  It made fun of everyone and I mean everyone.  It used sight gags The Simpsons and Futurama are afraid to use and goes beyond.  Quite simply it is under appreciated.Season one was short but sweet.  Peter cheats the government, feigns Homer Simpson with TV withdrawal, Stewie thwarts a cult leader, Peter punches a woman, builds a bar in his basement and turns Lois into a famous lounge singer, Peter exploits the handicapped, Lois pulls a Marge Simpson and becomes a gambling junkie and finally Brian steals the show.  It sound a lot like The Simpsons, but it had more guts.  It wasn't afraid to make you laugh by offending anyone and it did it so well.Season two only got better.  Peter's piano talent is accesbiel only through imbibing alcohol, he turn the King And I into a cyborg kill fest, breast feeds Stewie in the shows funniest sight gag to date, leads his family in rebellion and it thorws in plenty of other song and dance numbers, the signs of a great cartoon.The dialogue is superb, just the right amount of plot advancing script as making fun of someone script.  The characters are hilarious. Quagmire is easily one of the best supporting cartoon characters since Moe, Brian is the smartest of the lot and he's a dog, martini sipping, chuck wagon chasing, golden voiced Brian.  Better than Astro, Dino and Santa's Little Helper combined.  Stewie is hilarious.  He easily eclipses Maggie as the best baby from a cartoon series.  Move over Pebbles and BamBam.The Griffins as a whole are like the Bunkers on steroids.  They're like The Simpsons on crack.  They're the King Of The Hill meets South Park.  They were a perfect hybrid of everything that makes a cartoon successful.  It had great writing, great voice talents, perfect matches for the characters, simple story lines made complex by the dynamics of the characters in them.  Stewie can turn even a simple love story at a day care center into a mature story line with witty dialogue delivered with adult emotion, but then expose the cold hearted Janet for just wanting his cookies.  Great symbolism!In the end, this show got the short of the stick.  It got a raw deal when television needed a show like this.  It is wildly popular, thank God for this boxed set and it's revival on Cartoon Networks Adult Swim.  I know many people that want to see this show back on Sunday night amid The Simpsons, Futurama and King Of The Hill, where it belongs.  But now it can live on forever and thank the Fox Corporation for giving us this treat.  Buy it and watch it as often as you can!

Family guy will be returning on fox for a fourth season in june 2005, and with the recent attacks by the FCC on the more risk taking shows, it looks like it's going to be one hell of a fourth season.

One for the new Slim Set.BOXED SET:This box set comes with the first two seasons of Family Guy. The front cover shows the Griffin Family together having a fun time. The back cover shows and alternate Stewie photo and a description of the Volume One boxed set with bonus material and such. Inside there three thin plasitc cases for the discs. The front of each case has the main cover photo of the griffins on a different colored background. The backside of the cases have Episode Descriptions and what features are on the disc. Each disc has different artowork with different characters on them.SLIM SET (you get this if ordered from Amazon now):This slim set comes with the first two seasons of Family Guy, just like the original. The front and back cover's artwork is unchanged. However, the inside is much different. The inside has no episode descriptions. Just the disc number and episode title. There is little to no artwork inside. The discs artwork is the exact same, though.FINAL THOUGHTS:If you would prefer to get the boxed set with artwork and such go for it. But order it from another site. Amazon only ships the slim sets now. If you don't mind. Go for the slim set.

Since Family Guy is so edgy and controversial anyways, an unrated movie would really tear the roof off by its fingertips. Only for some reason, the film(not really, it's more like 3 episodes bunched together) is funny at times but not on a massive consistent level. In other words, there's certain jokes in the show that I literally had to pause the DVD cause I was laughing so hard. Here? Just a good little laugh.The episode starts out average enough with Stewie going swimming only encountering a rival. Wanting to get even, his plan instead backfires causing him to go to hell with a disturbing encounter with Steve Allen. Back on Earth, he vows to be more nicer which doesn't last long until he sees someone on TV which looks remarkably similar to himself so it's another Brian and Stewie road trip to find his father, or is it?Many of the jokes fall incredibly flat or you just get a good chuckle or 2. The biggest one for me was actually this spoof on overzealous salesmen on TV with a really long product name. Very well done. Others don't fare so well such as Elmer finally getting Bugs in the most un-Warner Bros. way possible.Extras are a bit disappointing. You get an animatic comparison and a full length commentary with writers and actors. I would've liked to see something similar to one of the season sets featurettes where the actors detail inspiration for voices and characters.For Family Guy fans this is a must-have although I think Fox is planning to air these episodes in typical weekly fashion but at least we get it uncensored.

This DVD is a no-holds-barred masterpiece of iconoclastic humor, not for the faint of heart.  The censors have had a field day with Family Guy episodes since its first broadcast, and that is a recommendation in its own right!  All our favorite characters have their moments - Brian the alcoholic intellectual dog, Stewie the evil mastermind infant, Meg the homely teen girl, Chris the overweight underachiever, Peter the buffoon who enjoys the guilty pleasures in life, Lois the former party girl from a wealthy family turned Mom, and Mayor Adam West (played by the 70's classic Batman, Adam West) as a paranoid Mayor of Quahaug RI.  In the very beginning, you see Lois tumble ass over teakettle on the red carpet from the limo to the ""opening night"" of this film, tanked from the champagne in the limo and wanting to do Peter then and there - and it sets the stage for the rest of the film, which is a bawdy fun tale of Stewie seeking the ""mysterious man"" whom he believes must be his biological father.  Stewie is inspired by the concept that Peter, a simpleton, could not have produced the DNA which created such a brilliant sinister genious, and decides to find the mysterious man he glimpsed who resonated with him so strongly.  The revelation of the mysterious man's identity drives the plot, as pop culture references, quips, and the never-ending insult duels between Brian and Stewie keep the laughs going.  We all know a Quagmire (clich? ladies' man ridiculous to all but himself and the conquests he ensnares with his lifelong experience of chasing tail), a Cleveland (sweet stable guy-next-door who is the calm in the storm and the voice of ethics and helping our fellow man), a Joe (while he is in a wheelchair, his personality as an overly macho jock is abundantly clear) and all our favorites.  We know people like these, and this is an unabashed portrayal of them that is only a slight exaggeration!  If you are easily offended, Family Guy isn't for you, but it should be.  If you can't laugh at your own beliefs, they are dogma not truth - truth is strong enough to handle the challenge of humor.  The pop culture references and laughs are sharp social commentary and the humor is edgy to say the least.  I agree with another reviewer - this was more like a few episodes put together, rather than feeling like a feature length film, but who cares when it is as good as this?

However, if your not easily offended, you'll be laughing from the very first episode to the last one on this set. An example of the crazy humor in you'll find in Fmaily Guy is a scene where Peter (the father) fights a giant chicken for 5 while minutes. The fights takes them from the sidewalk, to a truck, to a helicopter, then on top of a skyscraper. In the same episode, Peter is informed of Y2K by a man in a chicken costume.

The film is a three part story wrapped around and intro and wrap up that parodies a Hollywood premiere and party.The jokes fly fast and bawdy and pull no punches. Every pop culture reference no matter how obscure and some of the more controversial issues of the day are tossed in, and for the most part, work.The story follows the evil genius Stewie, who after a near death experience decides to change his ways as Hell does not hold much appeal for him. After the family gets Tivo, Stewie spots a person on television that is a spitting image of him. Convinced that the man is his real father, Stewie and the family dog Brian, join the hormonally driven Quagmire on a cross country trek.When Stewie reaches the coast he is shocked to discover the true identity of the man which will propel the remained of the story.While the show has a few misfires, it is mostly filled with one effective joke after another. The laughs were constant and I found myself enjoying every moment of the film. The laughs are very good, and if you are a fan of the show and do not mind some biting, and crude humor, this is a great escape.Fans of the show will love the usual interplay of the characters and the familiar style and pacing as the film plays out like a regular episode of the show, as it was initiated as a three part episode. The inclusion of segments that would not have likely made it past the networks Standards and Practices department only ads to the enjoyment of the show as it is nice to see a shown known for pushing the envelope taking steps that it would not otherwise be able to take.4 stars out of 5.Gareth Von Kallenbach",4,"While it started as a simple three part episode, it ends as one of the best Family Guy outings ever.",1126051200,"09 7, 2005",2005,1786,"['classic', 'animated', 'series', 'Family', 'Guy', 'up', 'success', 'return', 'Prime', 'Time', 'lineup', 'DVD', 'movie', 'Stewie', 'Griffin', 'Untold', 'Story', 'film', 'three', 'part', 'story', 'wrapped', 'intro', 'wrap', 'up', 'Hollywood', 'premiere', 'party.The', 'jokes', 'fly', 'fast', 'bawdy', 'pull', 'punches', 'pop', 'culture', 'reference', 'matter', 'how', 'obscure', 'more', 'controversial', 'issues', 'day', 'are', 'tossed', 'most', 'part', 'work.The', 'story', 'evil', 'genius', 'Stewie', 'who', 'near', 'death', 'experience', 'change', 'ways', 'Hell', 'not', 'hold', 'much', 'appeal', 'family', 'Tivo', 'Stewie', 'person', 'television', 'spitting', 'image', 'Convinced', 'man', 'real', 'father', 'Stewie', 'family', 'dog', 'Brian', 'join', 'hormonally', 'driven', 'Quagmire', 'cross', 'country', 'trek.When', 'Stewie', 'coast', 'shocked', 'discover', 'true', 'identity', 'man', 'will', 'propel', 'remained', 'story.While', 'show', 'few', 'misfires', 'mostly', 'filled', 'one', 'effective', 'joke', 'laughs', 'were', 'constant', 'found', 'enjoying', 'moment', 'film', 'laughs', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'are', 'fan', 'show', 'do', 'not', 'mind', 'biting', 'crude', 'humor', 'great', 'escape.Fans', 'show', 'will', 'love', 'usual', 'interplay', 'characters', 'familiar', 'style', 'pacing', 'film', 'out', 'regular', 'episode', 'show', 'was', 'initiated', 'three', 'part', 'episode', 'inclusion', 'segments', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'likely', 'made', 'networks', 'Standards', 'Practices', 'department', 'only', 'ads', 'enjoyment', 'show', 'nice', 'see', 'shown', 'known', 'pushing', 'envelope', 'taking', 'steps', 'would', 'not', 'otherwise', 'be', 'able', 'take.4', 'stars', '5.Gareth', 'Von', 'Kallenbach']","Family Guy, Volume One"

It has everything you love about FG: random references to media from the past & present, lowbrow humor that makes the Simpsons look tame (which it sort of is), and creator Seth MacFarlane doing half the voices.The story, folks, is simply this: Stewie is crushed under a lifeguard tower and nearly dies. He discovers life is precious and turns ""nice"" for a while, until he sees a man on TV in San Francisco that looks just like him. Thinking it could be his real father, he and Brian head out in Quagmire's Winnebago, tackling obstacles until he reaches the man and discovers it's really a future version of Stewie, a pathetic virgin who works at a Circuit City-like place and lives by himself. After helping Stu, as he goes by now, get his life together (sort of) and seeing a future version of the family (Peter and Lois are just older versions of themselves, Chris is a henpecked cop, and Meg is a man named Ron), Stewie races back to prevent his near-death experience so he won't grow up to be a mess.Thrown in here are jabs at Ray Charles, Casper the Friendly Ghost, Johnny Quest, Lethal Weapon, Indiana Jones (Temple of Doom AND The Last Crusade!), Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Shield, and more. It's no worse than the show in terms of content (Officer Scrotes, maybe, but that's awesome), unless you listen to the uncensored track with full-on F-bombs that are usually bleeped (most provided by Chris's wife).

732707,A3G3DN6ODH3RXR,B000083C6V,Graham V. Foy,"[31, 44]","Here's the honest truth, America: ""Family Guy"" is the one show that tops ""The Simpsons"". Honestly, can you IMAGINE what this show could have been if it had been allowed to continue? Unfortunately, it was just too witty, satirical and shocking for the American palate.Now, here is why I think ""Family Guy"" deserves to be ranked among the best shows ever. What ""Family Guy"" really is is a facade of outrageous humor that masks a secret agenda: to show our American life for what it really is. The absurd situations in which Peter consistently finds himself are indicative not of a crazy made-up world, but our America and our way of life. You'll notice that while the adventures of the Simpsons unfold in the Springfield of a state that is never revealed, the very first episode of ""Family Guy"" informs us that the Griffins make their home in Rhode Island, though the name of the town itself is fictional. I believe that this points to an undeniable ""realness"" of the show as a whole: the characters do human things, and more importantly they exhibit characteristics (and problems) of the real modern world. Peter is dense and absorbed by TV, Meg is run-down by the pressures of being a girl (she has a friend who encourages her to throw up to get thin), Lois is underappreciated by her family, Brian is a recurrent problem drinker, and Chris is a typically overweight adolescent who leaves the house every day ""to go get wasted"". Those are just the main characters! However, to really appreciate this show and its VERY well-written storylines, you'll just have to watch it. I guarantee you you'll be shocked, surprised and, if you have even the slightest predisposition towards laughter, on the floor before the end of the first episode.

Tucker is a lot like Ferrel's character of""Anchorman"", hes a male chauvonist pig.

I guess that little kids are too young to comprehend most of the jokes on Family Guy. I'm going on 15 but I understand all of them and this show is by far the funniest ever. Family guy was most definitely influenced by the simpsons but it's now WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY better than the simpson. Peter ressembles Homer, and Lois ressembles Marge. But Chris is a lot more awesome than Bart with the evil monkey in his closet and his jokes. ""THEY GIVE YOU 4 QUARTERS FOR 1 DOLLAR!!!!"" Meg is hilarious with her weird hat and she beats lisa barely. But, then who's better, Stewie or Maggie? I menan come on, Maggie doesn't even talk! Stewie is absolutely hilarious with his catch phrases (Dam*!)and no one even realizes that he is a genius. He wants to kill Lois and has picture books of him trying to kill her (a la psycho shower scene, poison drink, etc..) and Brian is a billion times better than santa's little helper. He goes to a psychiatrist, no one seems to realize that he can talk, he smokes and is always drunk! You just got to love him. And even though the simpsons has a lot more characters, Family guy has better ones like the sex pervert Quagmeyer, Cleveland, Joe, Tom Tucker, Trisha Tackinawa, etc..While the Simpsons just seems to the most of time just tell an interesting story, Family Guy tells an interesting but hilarious story. Family Guy makes me laugh, and that's something that I like doing. But, I have to admit that sometimes it does go over the top, and when it does, I feel that it's innapropriate. Nevertheless, it's usually hilarious with only certain parts that are over the top. But, if parents are worried for their young children about watching this show, I do admit that it's probably better for 13 year olds and so forth due to some unnecessary over the top stuff that comes along every once in a while.

Every episode is a ten with the exception of a few, which are 8 and 9s (on a scale of 10).This show is for people who enjoy random and edgy comedy that makes fun pop culture. All the characters are funny in their own way, Chris the son is probably the least likable, but he has occasional one liners. You can't really compare the show to The Simpson's, they're just different shows. The ambiance of each is so different that they're incomparable. I mean they have a talking dog in this show, common!Usually, babies talking as grownups don't work, but in this show, Stewie is hilarious. The writers have done a wonderful job of showing the world through baby's eyes and made him multidimensional by making him a matricidal anarchist. He has some classic lines in the show that are absolutely memorable. He is the most articulate person/baby on TV (I'm aware of Frasier).""It seems with death incapacitated my matricidal efforts are futile.""""Well, I'd love to stay and chat, but you're a total bitch.""Lois: ""Oh, I haven't been on a college campus in years.

This is BY FAR one of the funniest animation shows ever put on tv - with so many pop culture references, sight gags, plays on words, and spoofs, it appeals to every level or humor from slapstick to brainiac.Peter and Lois Griffin head a family (unhygienic son Chris, social-misfit daughter Meg, plotting-to-take-over-the-world-after-he-kills-his-mother baby boy Stewie, and their pet -- a talking dog named Brian who's also an intellectual alcoholic) that is as dysfunctional as it comes.  They live in Quahog, Rhode Island, and seem to often know they are a sitcom family, even if the situations they get into are usually more outrageous than most.This show is for adults, make no mistake - the humor often borders on raunchy - but in watching this show there were times I would laugh so hard I thought I was going to lose bladder control; it is THAT funny.Fox may have been stupid in not giving ""Family Guy"" what it deserved while on the air - but my VHS tapes of it that I recorded while the show was on are so worn out with overuse, GOD BLESS FOX for releasing this on DVD -- and not soon enough!!If you haven't seen ""Family Guy,"" at least rent them when they are released - you will become hooked on this show right away, and wonder (like the rest of us) why Fox didn't treat it better --or fight harder to keep it on the air.",5,"Yes, Virginia, there IS a Santa Claus!!",1044230400,"02 3, 2003",2003,1480,"['was', 'dark', 'dark', 'day', 'tv', 'animation', 'when', 'Fox', 'finally', 'put', 'end', 'Family', 'Guy', 'killing', 'shifting', 'around', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'slots', 'BY', 'FAR', 'one', 'funniest', 'animation', 'ever', 'put', 'tv', 'so', 'many', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'sight', 'gags', 'plays', 'words', 'spoofs', 'appeals', 'level', 'humor', 'slapstick', 'brainiac.Peter', 'Lois', 'Griffin', 'head', 'family', 'unhygienic', 'son', 'Chris', 'social-misfit', 'daughter', 'Meg', 'plotting-to-take-over-the-world-after-he-kills-his-mother', 'baby', 'boy', 'Stewie', 'pet', 'talking', 'dog', 'named', 'Brian', 'who', 'also', 'intellectual', 'alcoholic', 'as', 'dysfunctional', 'live', 'Quahog', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'seem', 'often', 'know', 'are', 'sitcom', 'family', 'even', 'situations', 'get', 'are', 'usually', 'more', 'outrageous', 'most.This', 'show', 'adults', 'make', 'mistake', 'humor', 'often', 'raunchy', 'watching', 'show', 'were', 'times', 'would', 'laugh', 'so', 'hard', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'lose', 'bladder', 'control', 'funny.Fox', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'stupid', 'not', 'giving', 'Family', 'Guy', 'what', 'deserved', 'air', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'recorded', 'show', 'was', 'are', 'so', 'worn', 'out', 'overuse', 'GOD', 'BLESS', 'FOX', 'releasing', 'DVD', 'not', 'soon', 'enough', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Family', 'Guy', 'least', 'rent', 'when', 'are', 'released', 'will', 'become', 'hooked', 'show', 'right', 'away', 'wonder', 'rest', 'why', 'Fox', 'did', ""n't"", 'treat', 'better', 'fight', 'harder', 'keep', 'air']","Family Guy, Volume One"
732734,A1JV3OZZVLHW85,B000083C6V,Jaime Rafael Vazquez,"[12, 19]","Let me start my review off wih some good news:  Seth MacFarlane revealed in an interview with Cinescape.com that he is hashing out a budget with FOX to create more Family Guy episodes (on tv or dvd, I don't know) and a feature length movie (direct-to-dvd).  The projects should take bewteen a year and a year and a half.  Now before I decided to write my review on this great show I decided to read the 1 and 2 star reviews (at this time a combined 12) and the 4 and 5 star reviews (at this time a combined 311, mine not included) and alot of the 1 and 2's had kept saying that this show is just a blatant rip off of The Simpsons.  Well I'm sorry to tell you this 1 and 2's but it's not.  Family Guy is better.  Now don't get me wrong, I love the Simpsons, I remember watching their first episodes when they were airing on Thursdays I believe.  But after about 13 years the show can get a little stale.  This will eventually happen to King of the Hill, Futurama and of course Family Guy.  But since Family Guy is the new baby in the house maybe it's about time for the Simpsons to bow out gracfully and pass down the torch.  Now alot of the 1 and 2's said that the members of both families were exactly the same but this is not true.  And I'll prove it to you by playing Simpsons vs. Griffins.  I will take the same member of each family (mom vs. mom, dad vs. dad) and I will compare them.  We start off with Homer vs. Peter: Same height, same colored hair (if Homer still had his) but Peter is fatter.  Now one worked at a toy company making sure they were safe to play with.  The other works as a safty inspector at a power plant.  Different jobs, same responibility.  But while Homer learns from his mistakes, alot of the time Peter learns nothing, like in the episode ""He's too sexy for his fat"".  But in the end: Homer and Peter might have been long lost brothers.  Marge vs. Lois: Lois is around 5'2"", Marge is around 7'5""-8' (with hair).  Both are house wives.  One became a flight attendent for a while and ones father was a flight attendent.  Lois was born rich, Marge was born just below middle class.  Marge and Homer like to do it in public.  Lois and Peter do it with whips, chains, leather, and Peter dressing up like the Gimp in Pulp Fiction.  In the end: Both are kinky and at times can be as bad as there husbands.  Now when it comes to the parents it's almost identical but the kids aren't alright.  Take Bart vs. Chris:  Both have blond hair, but that's all.  Bart is a little chunky, Chris is just fat.  Bart is a smooth talker that can get himself out of almost any problem.  Chris is kind of an idiot and might be ""special"".  Bart rides a skateboard. Chris can barely walk staight.  Bart fears almost nothing.  Chris is afraid of the evil monkey in his closest.  Sorry but in the end:  They maybe two Jacks but their of a differnt suit.  NO MATCH.  Lisa vs. Meg:  Lisa and Meg are both whiners but Lisa whines about social issues, Meg whines about her social life and not having the things her friends have.  Lisa is basicly an intellectual loner that doesn't really care what others think about her, all Meg ever cares about is what poeple think about her.  In the end:  One is a political and environmental activist, the other is just a brat (of course to some people that's two of the same thing).  NO MATCH.  Maggie vs. Stewie:  You can't get more opposite then this.  Both are the same age but most of the time Maggie acts her age.  Stewie acts like a gay, british Lex Luther hell-bent on taking over the world and getting rid of his mother once and for all.  Maggie loves her mommy and her bo-bo (pacifier).  Stewie talks eloquently and creates weapons and devices for world domination.  Maggie creates drool and the only word I ever heard her say was daddy.  In the end: they may be a pair quarters, but ones facing heads and the others facing tails.  NO MATCH.  When I said you couldn't get more opposite then Maggie vs. Stewie I was wrong beacuse I forgot about Santas Little Helper vs. Brian:  S.L.H. eats dog food, drinks water out of his bowl, barks when he wants too and is basicly a stupid dog (stupid as in not smart not stupid as in he sucks).  Brian eats whatever the Griffins are having for dinner while sitting at the dinner table.  He drinks martinis, gin and tonics, jack and cokes, and other forms of alcohol.  He speaks, not like when you ask a dog to speak but he talks like a person (english and bad spanish).  He is almost always out-smarting Stewie so he is very intelligent.  In the end:  Sorry but S.L.H. isn't fit to be near Brians martini glass.  NO MATCH.  The neighbors are different as well.  The Simpsons have Flanders (extremely religous guy), Reverend Lovejoy (not as religous as Flanders) and an old couple.  The Griffins have Cleavland (smart black guy), Joe (suped-up cop in a wheelchair) and Quagmire (sex-crazed weirdo).  On the political side you have Mayor Quimby and Mayor Adam West (yes, Batman).  One is an embezzler (never proven of course) and the other is insane (proven everytime you see him).  Some people say that Family Guy is sexist, racist, misogynistic and a little bit anti-semitic but that's what makes it funny.  Its political incorrectness is what gives it its edge.

732762,APRU373UYVK2Y,B000083C6V,J. N. Mohlman,"[4, 5]","Often one will hear the phrase tossed about that a show was ""too edgy"" for TV.  Usually, this is just apologia for a poorly conceived product, but in the case of ""Family Guy"" it is absolutely true.  This is a show that was every bit as radical as ""South Park"" but in a much more sophisticated, droll manner.  The odd thing is that at the same time it's skewering every sacred cow imaginable (more on that latter) with brilliantly satirical writing, it was also producing some of the most hysterical physical (for lack of a better phrase for a cartoon) comedy I have ever seen on any show.Much like ""The Simpsons"", ""Family Guy"" revolves around one family, in this case the Griffins.  That's pretty much where the similarities end though.  Whereas the Simpsons interact with a huge cast of characters, and will frequently tackle an overarching theme, ""Family Guy"" involves a cast that is largely replaced from episode to episode (other than a few neighbors) and manages to turn utterly inane pop-culture references and mundane household events into major plot points.  A particularly good example of this would be when Peter (the father) has his choice for the town parade theme selected; the fact that his theme revolves around an obscure reference to the `80's TV show ""Who's the Boss?"" barely even registers as odd within the context of the show.Also, whereas ""The Simpsons"" operate within the context of a `world' that is relatively similar to our own, the Griffins have a talking, booze-swilling dog and a psychotic, super-genius baby bent on killing his mother.  Furthermore, there are constant flashbacks, pop-culture references and super-natural visitors (Death appears in several episodes).All those details aside, what makes this show so brilliant is that it's willing to tackle any subject.  Bathroom humor?  Done.  Abortion?  Done.  Politics, the handicapped and sex?  Done, done and done.  There is absolutely nothing ""Family Guy"" won't tackle, and it does so in such a pragmatic way that one can't help but laugh.  I suppose if you're really sensitive, this isn't a series for you, but since everyone and everything is a target, it's hard to get too upset (especially since you'll be too busy laughing yourself sick).In the end, ""Family Guy"" is the perfect blend of satire, physical comedy, pop-culture send-ups and excellent animation.  It is a genuinely raw show that on more than one occasion left me thinking, ""Can they say that?"" and that's probably why it's not on the air anymore.  But it's also hysterically funny, and well packaged on the DVD's in this set.  While the extra's are nothing to get worked up about, the episodes alone are more than funny enough to justify the purchase.Enjoy!Jake Mohlman",5,Insanely funny!,1052265600,"05 7, 2003",2003,2722,"['Often', 'one', 'will', 'hear', 'phrase', 'tossed', 'show', 'was', 'too', 'edgy', 'TV', 'Usually', 'just', 'apologia', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'product', 'case', 'Family', 'Guy', 'absolutely', 'true', 'show', 'was', 'bit', 'as', 'radical', 'South', 'Park', 'much', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'droll', 'manner', 'odd', 'thing', 'same', 'time', 'skewering', 'sacred', 'cow', 'imaginable', 'more', 'latter', 'brilliantly', 'satirical', 'writing', 'was', 'also', 'producing', 'most', 'hysterical', 'physical', 'lack', 'better', 'phrase', 'cartoon', 'comedy', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'show.Much', 'Simpsons', 'Family', 'Guy', 'one', 'family', 'case', 'Griffins', 'pretty', 'much', 'where', 'similarities', 'end', 'Simpsons', 'interact', 'huge', 'cast', 'characters', 'will', 'frequently', 'tackle', 'overarching', 'theme', 'Family', 'Guy', 'cast', 'largely', 'replaced', 'episode', 'episode', 'other', 'few', 'neighbors', 'turn', 'utterly', 'inane', 'pop-culture', 'references', 'mundane', 'household', 'events', 'major', 'plot', 'points', 'particularly', 'good', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'when', 'Peter', 'father', 'choice', 'town', 'parade', 'theme', 'selected', 'fact', 'theme', 'obscure', 'reference', '80', 'TV', 'show', 'Who', 'Boss', 'barely', 'even', 'registers', 'odd', 'context', 'show.Also', 'Simpsons', 'operate', 'context', 'world', 'relatively', 'similar', 'own', 'Griffins', 'have', 'talking', 'booze-swilling', 'dog', 'psychotic', 'super-genius', 'baby', 'bent', 'killing', 'mother', 'Furthermore', 'are', 'constant', 'flashbacks', 'pop-culture', 'references', 'super-natural', 'visitors', 'Death', 'several', 'episodes', '.All', 'details', 'aside', 'what', 'show', 'so', 'brilliant', 'willing', 'tackle', 'subject', 'Bathroom', 'humor', 'Done', 'Abortion', 'Done', 'Politics', 'handicapped', 'sex', 'Done', 'done', 'done', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'Family', 'Guy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tackle', 'so', 'such', 'pragmatic', 'way', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'suppose', ""'re"", 'really', 'sensitive', ""n't"", 'series', 'everyone', 'everything', 'target', 'hard', 'get', 'too', 'upset', 'especially', ""'ll"", 'be', 'too', 'busy', 'laughing', 'sick', 'end', 'Family', 'Guy', 'perfect', 'blend', 'satire', 'physical', 'comedy', 'pop-culture', 'send-ups', 'excellent', 'animation', 'genuinely', 'raw', 'show', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'left', 'thinking', 'say', 'probably', 'why', 'not', 'air', 'anymore', 'also', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'well', 'packaged', 'DVD', 'set', 'extra', 'are', 'nothing', 'get', 'worked', 'up', 'about', 'episodes', 'alone', 'are', 'more', 'funny', 'enough', 'justify', 'purchase.Enjoy', 'Jake', 'Mohlman']","Family Guy, Volume One"

It's hard to list the best points because it is all so good, but really, the high point for me are the escapades of Stewie, the infant-terrible with the football-shaped head. He is cleverly done--the writers seem to have read Freud and other psychological theorists who believe that babies have both a megalomania complex and at the same time, fear their mothers as some kind of dreadful, all-powerful but necessary being who cruelly controls their happiness and even survival. Stewie's conniving to rule the world and dispatch his despised mom are hysterical.Not that Peter, head Family Guy, Brian the Brown-educated, dipsomaniac pet dog, and Lois and her dysfunctional kids aren't funny, too.

This The Empire Strikes Back parody has some great features, some of the graphics were fabulous and even looked like copies of the original - it took me back very nicely. As for the new take, a lot of it went OK but it was by no means consistent. As is Family Guys want, there were several `out there' moments where a scene diverted into something completely different. Some worked well, others less so, or they went on too long. This is part of Family Guys thing, taking things too far and then taking them further again. I like the way the show makes fun of itself like this but too much and you begin getting bored - in Darkside this happens a bit much. One of the main problems is that a lot of the focus is on Chris/Luke Skywalker. He's just one of the less funny characters and it's hard to make scenes he's in hilarious. Conversely, by sticking so close to the original story, Brian, regrettably, gets very little to do.

As I read some of the past reviews, I noticed that some viewers didn't think of it like the TV show, and I could understand that viewpoint. It was a little slow in the beginning, but it ends with one of the best Family Guy endings ever. As far as special features go... I think there could have been a lot more features but I can only hope the producers hope to make this up to us in Season Four (Volume 3) of Family Guy coming out on DVD in late November.

Chris is the 13 year son whom is also dumb like his dad, Meg is the teenage daughter that seems shy around her friends when she's with her family, Brian is the talking walking human-like dog, Lois is the gorgeous woman of the house and Stewie is the highly intelligent talking infant who has a plot for taking over the world.This show is most definitely one of the funniest and most outrageous animated shows on TV! it did got canned in 2002, but luckily Adult Swim on ""Cartoon Network"" has gotten big time ratings with some new episodes coming out this year and has gained a huge cult following for it's wackiness, deadpan humor and satire.This Boxset contains the first two seasons with three of my personal favorite episodes ""Death is a B*&^%&"", ""Road to Rhode Island"" and ""Waste Talent"" on this 3 Disc set that contains original Internet spots to promote the show, audio commentaries by the show's makers and a featurette behind the scenes on the show.I highly recommend this excellent animated comedy series to animation's fans and is definitely worthy to be in a animation lover's DVD collection alongside ""Futurama"" and "" The Simpsons"".",5,Best animated comedy on TV on a great DVD set!,1106006400,"01 18, 2005",2005,1463,"['animated', 'comedy', 'show', 'debuted', 'early', '1999', 'definitely', 'pushed', 'buttons', 'values', 'taste', 'great', 'laughs', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'who', 'are', 'called', 'Griffens', 'Peter', 'Griffen', 'lovable', 'dummy', 'father', 'whom', 'family', 'very', 'much', 'never', 'too', 'much', 'fun', 'even', 'mind', 'Chris', '13', 'year', 'son', 'whom', 'also', 'dumb', 'dad', 'Meg', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'shy', 'friends', 'when', 'family', 'Brian', 'talking', 'walking', 'human-like', 'dog', 'Lois', 'gorgeous', 'woman', 'house', 'Stewie', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'talking', 'infant', 'who', 'plot', 'taking', 'over', 'world.This', 'show', 'most', 'definitely', 'one', 'funniest', 'most', 'outrageous', 'animated', 'shows', 'TV', 'did', 'got', 'canned', '2002', 'luckily', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'gotten', 'big', 'time', 'ratings', 'new', 'episodes', 'coming', 'out', 'year', 'gained', 'huge', 'cult', 'following', 'wackiness', 'deadpan', 'humor', 'satire.This', 'Boxset', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'three', 'personal', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'Death', 'B*', '^', '%', 'Road', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'Waste', 'Talent', '3', 'Disc', 'set', 'original', 'Internet', 'spots', 'promote', 'show', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'show', 'makers', 'featurette', 'scenes', 'show.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'excellent', 'animated', 'comedy', 'series', 'animation', 'fans', 'definitely', 'worthy', 'be', 'animation', 'lover', 'DVD', 'collection', 'Futurama', 'Simpsons']","Family Guy, Volume One"
732768,A153MVFR0FTI6O,B000083C6V,John Nelson,"[1, 1]","You can chalk FAMILY GUY up with The Job, The Young Ones and Greg The Bunny among others as a great show that were cancelled for no good reason or ended way before their time.  Not to mention that they were all some of the funniest shows to grace TV.On the surface, FAMILY GUY isn't the greatest show due to the mold it was in which was a wannabe Simpsons mode; Peter the dad, Lois the Mom and Meg the daughter could be modeled after Homer, Marge and Lisa from the SIMPSONS.  Homer and Peter are both fat, insensitive dumb fathers, Lois and Marge are both suffering wives who stay with their husbands for no good reason.  Meg and Lisa suffer through unpopularity through school.  Chris is the only original character of the mainstream family, and by himself is annoying.  Too bad he wasn't modeled after Bart.  Only the shows two standout characters were of any sort of new ground; Brian the Dog who imbibes cocktails, smokes cigerettes and dispenses advice to his dolt owner and baby Stewie who at the age of one builds laser weapons, blow guns and other weapons to destroy the oblivious Lois and later on became a mean prankster.  At the end, lessons would usually be learned that would only make the SIMPSONS creators roll their eyes and think ""You know we used to do that too, remember when Bart cut off the statues head?""  One episode even has a character have a hallucinitory dream the way some Simpsons characters did early on.With all of that negativity out of the way, the shows brisk writing is what saved it and made it hilarious and broke it out of the mold.  Plots could start out on one topic and end on a completely different story (one episode has Peter planning on spending his tax money, after he is audited plans to build his own pool, to get a permit though he discovers his house isn't part of the US and forms his own country.)  Jokes sparkled with glorius lines (Peter tries potty training Stewie by offering him beer, since it makes you pee.  Stewie responds by saying while they were at it they could ""light up a doobie and watch porn"".  Peter considers it.)  The show was sprinkled with nonsequitors throughout that would be right out of the blue and hilarious.  (Peter sneaks out to go to a school function but falls off the roof, he is saved by Spiderman, who promptly leaves.)  The shows best part though came from the surreal flashbacks that characters would have for the purpose of telling a joke and I can't even start on those.The show also had the same kind of cutting, harsh, shock humor that the Simpsons used to have and South Park still achieves at times.  It was sadly the shows downfall.  One show (not on this DVD set but has been reported to be on the next release) was banned by Fox due to such content.  Religon and Race would be the butt of some jokes and other times the humor would get too blue (Lois and Peter dress up in Bondage gear during a casual conversation).  The show took chances, was funny and sadly was ended but it's place as a cult show has been cemented and will live on in the fans.If I may coment on the commentary of the show on the DVDs, even though only a few discs get commentary, they are all hilarious and the shows creator who provided the voice for Peter, Stewie and Brian does voices and it's great to hear (especially with swearing, and the voice of Lois during the first episode commentary is a standout).The only demerrits are not enough special features and that my favorite episode (Road to Rhode Island) has a scene cut out which featured Stewie sining showtunes to distract a airport guard so that he can smuggle weapons on the plane and even mentions Osama Bin Laden.  However the pilot episode did gain a scene, so it kind of evens out.Bottom line is that if you love South Park and the Simpsons, FAMILY GUY is a must own.  There is no excuse for not owning it if you like either of those shows.  If you decide not to get it, then as Stewie would say, BURN IN HELL!!!! (remember, he's one years old and wants to kill the mom.)",5,"Family Guy: dead before it's time, but finds life on DVD",1051056000,"04 23, 2003",2003,4008,"['can', 'chalk', 'FAMILY', 'GUY', 'up', 'Job', 'Young', 'Ones', 'Greg', 'Bunny', 'others', 'great', 'show', 'were', 'cancelled', 'good', 'reason', 'ended', 'way', 'time', 'Not', 'mention', 'were', 'funniest', 'shows', 'grace', 'TV.On', 'surface', 'FAMILY', 'GUY', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'show', 'due', 'mold', 'was', 'was', 'wannabe', 'Simpsons', 'mode', 'Peter', 'dad', 'Lois', 'Mom', 'Meg', 'daughter', 'could', 'be', 'modeled', 'Homer', 'Marge', 'Lisa', 'SIMPSONS', 'Homer', 'Peter', 'are', 'fat', 'insensitive', 'dumb', 'fathers', 'Lois', 'Marge', 'are', 'suffering', 'wives', 'who', 'stay', 'husbands', 'good', 'reason', 'Meg', 'Lisa', 'suffer', 'unpopularity', 'school', 'Chris', 'only', 'original', 'character', 'mainstream', 'family', 'annoying', 'Too', 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'modeled', 'Bart', 'Only', 'shows', 'two', 'standout', 'characters', 'were', 'sort', 'new', 'ground', 'Brian', 'Dog', 'who', 'imbibes', 'cocktails', 'smokes', 'cigerettes', 'dispenses', 'advice', 'dolt', 'owner', 'baby', 'Stewie', 'who', 'age', 'one', 'builds', 'laser', 'weapons', 'blow', 'guns', 'other', 'weapons', 'destroy', 'oblivious', 'Lois', 'later', 'became', 'mean', 'prankster', 'end', 'lessons', 'would', 'usually', 'be', 'learned', 'would', 'only', 'make', 'SIMPSONS', 'creators', 'roll', 'eyes', 'think', 'know', 'used', 'do', 'too', 'remember', 'when', 'Bart', 'cut', 'off', 'statues', 'head', 'One', 'episode', 'even', 'character', 'have', 'hallucinitory', 'dream', 'way', 'Simpsons', 'characters', 'did', 'early', 'on.With', 'negativity', 'way', 'shows', 'brisk', 'writing', 'what', 'saved', 'made', 'hilarious', 'broke', 'mold', 'Plots', 'could', 'start', 'out', 'one', 'topic', 'end', 'completely', 'different', 'story', 'one', 'episode', 'Peter', 'planning', 'spending', 'tax', 'money', 'audited', 'plans', 'build', 'own', 'pool', 'get', 'permit', 'house', ""n't"", 'part', 'US', 'forms', 'own', 'country', 'sparkled', 'glorius', 'lines', 'Peter', 'potty', 'training', 'Stewie', 'offering', 'beer', 'pee', 'Stewie', 'saying', 'were', 'could', 'light', 'up', 'doobie', 'watch', 'porn', 'Peter', 'show', 'was', 'sprinkled', 'nonsequitors', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'blue', 'hilarious', 'Peter', 'out', 'go', 'school', 'function', 'off', 'roof', 'saved', 'Spiderman', 'who', 'promptly', 'shows', 'best', 'part', 'came', 'surreal', 'flashbacks', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'purpose', 'telling', 'joke', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'start', 'those.The', 'show', 'also', 'had', 'same', 'kind', 'cutting', 'harsh', 'shock', 'humor', 'Simpsons', 'used', 'have', 'South', 'Park', 'still', 'times', 'was', 'sadly', 'shows', 'downfall', 'One', 'show', 'not', 'DVD', 'set', 'been', 'reported', 'be', 'next', 'release', 'was', 'banned', 'Fox', 'due', 'such', 'content', 'Religon', 'Race', 'would', 'be', 'butt', 'jokes', 'other', 'times', 'humor', 'would', 'get', 'too', 'blue', 'Lois', 'Peter', 'dress', 'up', 'Bondage', 'gear', 'casual', 'conversation', 'show', 'took', 'chances', 'was', 'funny', 'sadly', 'was', 'ended', 'place', 'cult', 'show', 'been', 'cemented', 'will', 'live', 'fans.If', 'may', 'coment', 'commentary', 'show', 'DVDs', 'even', 'only', 'few', 'discs', 'get', 'commentary', 'are', 'hilarious', 'shows', 'creator', 'who', 'provided', 'voice', 'Peter', 'Stewie', 'Brian', 'voices', 'great', 'hear', 'especially', 'swearing', 'voice', 'Lois', 'first', 'episode', 'commentary', 'standout', 'only', 'demerrits', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'special', 'features', 'favorite', 'episode', 'Road', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'scene', 'cut', 'out', 'featured', 'Stewie', 'sining', 'showtunes', 'distract', 'airport', 'guard', 'can', 'smuggle', 'weapons', 'plane', 'even', 'mentions', 'Osama', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'However', 'pilot', 'episode', 'did', 'gain', 'scene', 'kind', 'evens', 'out.Bottom', 'line', 'love', 'South', 'Park', 'Simpsons', 'FAMILY', 'GUY', 'must', 'own', 'excuse', 'not', 'owning', 'like', 'shows', 'decide', 'not', 'get', 'then', 'Stewie', 'would', 'say', 'BURN', 'IN', 'HELL', 'remember', 'one', 'years', 'old', 'kill', 'mom']","Family Guy, Volume One"

The voice actor who plays Lois is in most (if not all) of the commentaries, and she's very funny (as is Seth, of course).  They do pick on the show (&quot;See that? It means Peter is REALLY STUPID&quot;) and on each other (&quot;No, really, just give me a Yes or a No, Seth, and don't explain, so we can sit here for 20 minutes in silence.&quot;) but occasionally Seth or Lois's voice actor will do a character voice cursing or saying something funny (that's quite a laugh).

And since everybody I know likes at least one of these shows, it saddens me that there are fans of one show who insist on rebuking the other. Instead, people need to realize that it is these similarities that make both of these shows so great. Family Guy's humor may be a bit more abrasive, but it's just as successful at striking the right chords to make you laugh. Another comparison I can make with Family Guy is with the movie Airplane! Both feature quick pacing jokes which allow room for the hits and misses, and many many spoofs of different movies and tv shows (like my oh so favorite show, the Simpsons).Overall, when looking at the great animated comedies, Family Guy and the Simpsons come in with the one-two punch (and don't forget King of the Hill).

Peter Griffin was not the best character (dumb, has a stupid laugh) and his son has the same problem.2.  The show has some good jokes now and then.Cons:1.  I agree that the show was insensible in discussing many issues, like people with special needs or other religions.2.  There are many scenes with nudity and violence in this show, which I do not appreciate, especially for this ""family"" cartoon.  I also did not notice that this show brings many of the values for our society, despite what the song says (It seems today, that all you see, is violence in movies and sex on TV) !!

732808,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000083C6V,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 6]","Every semester in my Introduction to Popular Culture class the students make nominations and vote on what they think are the best shows on television today.  This semester the vote for the top spot is a battle between ""Lost"" and ""Family Guy,"" which is, of course pretty freakin' sweet.  The same can be said for ""Family Guy Presents Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story,"" which is a theatrical film version of the television series to the extent that three yet to be aired episodes linked together by a continuing story and bookended by an uncensored prologue and epilogue can be said to constitute such a thing.  Ironically, the biggest complaint is that the freedom of being a ""movie"" rather than a ""television show"" does not translate into the same sort of freedom that we say with ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut.""  I wanted to say that this is because eventually ""Family Guy"" would be able to run the three parts of this one as episodes on television whereas that was never going to happen with the ""South Park"" movie, except that Comedy Central shows it uncensored all the time now.The prologue has the ""Family Guy"" gang showing up for the premier of this film as they return to television after the hiatus forced upon them (Lois had the worst time of it, far and away, which explains why she shows up totally sloshed).  The continuing thread here is Stewie's search for his real father, an idea that begins by simply looking at Peter and trying to figure out a genetic connection, but which goes into high gear when Stewie sees a man on television who looks and talks exactly like what we would expect if Stewie was all grown up.  But before Stewie and Brian go on their cross-country journey, the littlest Griffin has a near-death experience that motivates him to try and change his evil ways.  Of course the main narrative thread is just an excuse to toss in as many jokes as possible, and there is certainly something to be said for not really being concerned with coming up with logical segues to throw references to Sacco & Vanzetti, ""Star Trek V,"" and Ziggy Stardust.  If I were going to point to a sequence that is emblematic of this movie I would pick Peter's ""What Grinds My Gears"" segment on television in which he attacks Lindsay Lohen (""What do you want, Lindsay? Tell me what you want?"").  I totally appreciate the sentiment, but if this is an ""uncensored"" movie then I expect there to be a lot more blood on the floor from start to finish (and more cartoon nudity).  So I was certainly entertained, but I really was expecting this to be really special and not just a collection of above average (future) television episodes.I can make an argument that the three funniest shows on television today are ""Family Guy,"" ""South Park"" and ""The Simpsons"" (who would have ever thought that ""The Simpsons"" would be considered a ""conservative"" cartoon show?).  What they have in common is what is being called ""flexible reality,"" which is simply the ability to go anywhere and do anything.  Obviously an animated series has an advantage over more realistic television in that regard.  Of those three series I think ""Family Guy"" clearly makes the best use of the practice, not only in terms of Peter's constant channeling of unseen lives, but also in the basic roster of characters.  Having either Stewie or Brian around is pretty good; having both, and constantly teaming them up as happens in this film, is pure genius, evil or otherwise.  Plus, the vocal talents of Seth MacFarlane, who does Stewie, Peter and Brian in the Griffin household plus Glen Quagmire and Tom Tucker, is as good as it gets for making diverse sounds out of one man's voice.

Burns,"[7, 23]","I started out like many people, discovering &quot;Family Guy&quot; reruns late at night on Cartoon Network's &quot;Adult Swim.&quot; I was never familiar with the show during its actual run, but seeing it late at night on television seemed a fresh breath of air compared to most of the unfunny crap and ridiculous reality shows that have infested TV lately. I immediately got ahold of the first season of &quot;Family Guy,&quot; and ran across a rather sad realization about the show: people, it's funny at times, but it's not all it's cracked up to be. &quot;Family Guy&quot; is often brilliant in the way that it comments on political and popular issues, and occasionally hilarious when it's REALLY irreverent (a foul-mouthed Big Bird that berates Chris Griffin comes to mind). The big problem with &quot;Family Guy&quot; - it can't survive on its own momentum and finish an episode. I find that most of the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episodes 'last' with me for about 10 or 12 minutes AT MOST, and then the episode falls stale and none of the gags work anymore. &quot;Family Guy&quot; is an obvious spawn of the ultimate of all animated shows, &quot;The Simpsons.&quot; Thank God, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; doesn't have anything to worry about. &quot;Family Guy&quot; lets most of its show coast on Simpsons-esque flashbacks, and YES, they're usually funny and often a riot. Sadly, &quot;Family Guy,&quot; despite its occasional spot-on irreverence, can only rely on those flashbacks and outrageous humor and can't actually carry a plot to the end. Some people find &quot;Family Guy&quot; to be one of the most brilliant and hilarious shows of all time. Some moments attest to that, I'll admit. There have been times I've been in stitches over certain moments on the show. Then again, most of those can't really save the fact that the humor of &quot;Family Guy&quot; can only carry it so far. After a while, it becomes obvious that shock-humor and flashbacks are just about the only things going for it.

I don't really see why people complain about it so much being 3 episodes, OK, it may have started off that way, but why complain about Family Guy? It's not that noticeable, when one episode ends and the other begins, because it does run that smoothly.This may be Stewie The Untold Story, but it doesn't really focus on Stewie as much as I thought it would. Unfortunately, it doesn't really focus much on my favourite character (and probably the character I'm most like, even though I hate the colour pink) Meg. She seems rather overlooked in this movie, with no funny scenes or stories.Stewie is definitely my other favourite character in Family Guy. He has me in fits all the time. So funny.

(Apparently, since I've only seen one Indiana Jones movie.) As normal, the references tend to go straight over my head, as I haven't seen the films, or don't get the humour but still enjoy it. I did manage to find two references in this, which my boyfriend didn't get, and I had to tell him, that they were referencing Sound Of Music & the infamous ""Turn Back Time"" video by Cher. I was quite happy with that!This is definitely a movie to be seen, and can be watched alone, even if you haven't seen any of the episodes before hand.

Now is it worth buying is the real question, especially given that it'll probably end up on tv at some point.  Well, the answer really depends on your love of the subject matter.  As with the other reviews, there's been criticism for this one being less funny than the other, but that's not surprising given that Empire Strikes Back, the movie parodied, is such a strongly made movie.  In some ways, it leads the movie to being more of a retelling of the film, rather than an actual parody, and so its not as funny as blu harvest, which is so easy to parody. Its not bad, just not as funny as before.So, you're desire to own this depends on your level of devotion to the source material.  Its funny, but not as funny as before.

732827,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B000083C6V,Michael Crane,"[5, 6]","This was something I had been waiting for ever since they started putting TV shows on DVD.  One of my favorite and short-lived comedies is now available to own on DVD.  That series being Family Guy, in a very nice package, ""Family Guy: Volume 1.""  All I can say is it's about freakin' time!!Yep, it's the family that was too rude and offensive for Fox to handle.  This very witty and extremely hilarious cartoon series takes comedy and satire to a whole different level.  I actually think this is much more offensive and outrageous than South Park.  With South Park, the offensive and crude humor is in your face and ""straight-to-the-point.""  With Family Guy, the offensive and sick twisted humor is very subtle in a shocking way.  The results: one of the funniest TV series to pollute your television set since Married with Children and The Simpsons.With this DVD collection, you get all 28 episodes from seasons 1 and 2.  (Not a bad deal, if you ask me!)  Relive your favorite moments with the Griffin Family as they get into the most chaotic and unbelievable situations that will have you laughing in tears.Here are the episodes:Death has a Shadow, I Never Met the Dead Man, Chitty Chitty Death Bang, Mind Over Murder, A Hero Sits Next Store, The Son Also Draws, Brian: Portrait of a Dog, Peter Peter Caviar Eater, Holy ***, Da Boom, Brian in Love, Love Thy Trophy, Death is a ***, The King is Dead, I Am Peter: Hear Me Roar, If I'm Dyin' I'm Lyin', Running Mates, A Picture's Worth a Thousand Bucks, Fifteen Minutes of Shame, Road to Rhode Island, Let's go to the Hop, *** Janet!, There's Something about Paulie, He's Too Sexy for His Fat, E Peterbus Unum, The Story on Page One, Wasted Talent, and Fore Father.The 4 DVDs also include commentaries, Internet promo spots, and a behind-the-scenes featurette.  It would've been nice to see some more extras, but I'm still pretty satisfied.The only major drawback is the picture tends to be shaky at times (you really notice it on the first episode).  Now, this isn't a major distraction and it doesn't happen non-stop, but it does happen every once and awhile.  (At least it does for me.  It's possible that it's the set that I bought or my DVD player that's causing the problem, but I'm pretty sure I read that someone else was having the same problems as well.)All in all, I am so happy that Family Guy is finally out there for everyone to own and enjoy once more.  It might've been a short-lived series, but  it's one that almost everybody has heard of and loves.  If you are down and feeling like you are having the worst day ever, pop in these babies and I assure you that you will forget all your troubles.  A very worthy purchase, indeed!Now, you can either have this nice Family Guy DVD set, or... what's in the Mystery Box!  I mean, a Mystery Box can be ANYTHING!  It can even be a freakin' Family Guy DVD set!!  We'll take the box!Get your hands on this set as soon as you can!  Trust me, it is very much worth it.",5,"The DVD Set, or....

732830,A3FOCW2R5LP3X4,B000083C6V,Michael Kent,"[4, 6]","First of all, I'd like to say that I love this show.Having said that, there are a few things that come to mind, one being the comparisons between Family Guy and The Simpsons, which others have elected to point out.Some of which include:1)Both fathers are morons who like to hang out with their friends at the local bar or sit in front of the TV.2)Both feature evil sons, though Stewie is more of an evil genious while Bart is just evil.3)Both feature mothers with annoying voices...though Lois will use her sex appeal...and both wear green.4)Both have outcast daughters...at least Lisa is smart...Meg is just a drag with her whining and her ""woe is me I'm unpopular"" attitude.5)Both feature a mix of regular and semi-regular supporting characters.6)Both families have dogs...and this is where Family Guy scores, as Brian is vastly superior in intellect and everything else to Santa's Little Helper.Without Brian and Stewie, this show would probably go nowhere and would certainly not have been resurrected as a series through its DVD sales. Do I see the show lasting sixteen years as The Simpsons has done? No, and this is the main reason... with The Simpsons, it took several viewings of episodes for me to become bored with certain ones...with Family Guy there were a few I would skip after viewing a couple of times.It'd be nice to say that these episodes stand up to the test of time, but certain ones don't hold up.Among these are:Chitty Chitty Death Bang - not that funny to begin with (with the exception of Brian's line ""I SAID runt."")the whole cult, let's drink some poisoned punch thing.DA BOOM - Too much like The Simpsons Treehouse Of Horror episodes and not consistant with the remaining episodes.THE KING IS DEAD - Just not much to offer in this one at all in the way of humor.I AM PETER, HEAR ME ROAR - Not that this is a bad episode, but that nipple sucking scene with Peter and Stewie gives me the creeps.RUNNING MATES - Just shows what a jerk Peter can be towards his wife...much like THE KING IS DEAD.A PICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND BUCKS - I guess I just find most episodes revolving around Chris or Meg boring and this one is right at the top.E PETERBUS UNUM - Just the title alone makes it worth skipping.Having said that, I would recommend the following as episodes worth repeated viewing:DEATH HAS A SHADOW - The first and one of the better episodes of the first season.MIND OVER MURDER - Lois becomes a stage attraction after Peter opens a bar in his basement after being placed under house arrest.BRIAN: PORTRAIT OF A DOG - Brian faces the death penalty after running out on the family after misbehaving at a dog show.BRIAN IN LOVE - Could Brian's carpet wetting problems have anything to do with his love for Lois?DEATH IS A BITCH - Death is injured, so Peter has to take over his duties (this is one The Simpsons blatently ripped off in one of their Treehouse episodes when Homer kills death, then becomes him)IF I'M DYIN', I'M LYIN' - Peter says Chris is dying so they can get their favorite show back on the air, then becomes known as a healer when Chris is ""cured"".ROAD TO RHODE ISLAND - Probably the one I watch the most. I like the song Brian and Stewie sing and the interaction between the two on the road. Brian shows once again how he is at once the most adult and the most flawed character on the show.LET'S GO TO THE HOP - Peter goes under cover to infiltrate the toad lickers at Meg's high school. Great musical number here, too.DAMMIT, JANET! - The first of the ""Stewie In Love"" themed shows.WASTED TALENT - Who knew Peter could play the piano...as long as he was wasted?If nothing else, it proves the whole Family Guy pattern that some shows hit the mark while others just splat against the wall and slide to the ground.

But over the years the Simpsons started getting a little stale.  And that's when Family Guy came in.Family Guy is, by far, the funniest animated television series since the Simpsons were in their prime.  We're weighing in alot of shows here...Ren and Stimpy, Futurama...but there's something about Family Guy that just warrants gut-busting laughs.  Maybe it's Quagmire's ridiculous attempts at picking up women, Peter's wealth of ignorance, little Stewie's attempts at world domination, or just the random silliness thrown in to all of the episodes, such as appearences by the Kool Aid man, the 'Two Scoops' sun from the old Raisin Bran commercials, references to the old Incredible Hulk television series...and alot more.Family Guy is definitely not for the kids...all of the situations are adult and sometimes are borderline risque (which got the series cancelled, unfortunately).  The network censors and committees have no idea what they've done...they threw away a gold mine.While it could never truly replace the Simpsons, Family Guy was well on its way to becoming the new dominant animated series on Fox.  The Simpsons have been stale the last few years...Family Guy breathed new life into prime time animation that you just don't see anymore.  It's too bad, really.  In any case, don't pass up the opportunity to own every episode on DVD!!Fans will love to have all episodes on dvd, I know i'm looking forward to it.  And even if you've never seen it, then take my advice: Pick it up anyway!  You will not regret it!  The extra features are a little bare bones, but it doesn't matter.

It's random, funny and original (but somehow makes no sense to BHogg). It's funny in two ways. 1.)It's random and comes out of nowhere and 2.)Alot of it actually comes from somewhere. Take that chicken fight for instance. Every place they end up fighting is taken from somewhere. I honestly can't remember everything 'cause I havent seen everything that they were refferencing, but the ending scene where they're fighting near the propelled airplane was from Indiana Jones. Another episode, in the scene where they invited the actress who played Lois Lane in Super Man II to dinner, the actress flips out when they mention that movie and goes into a tantrum and flips out the window. They were referrencing to the fact that she actually did go crazy during the making of that film. As for the crude and offensive language, they did this specifically for dvd.Now, why does anyone compare this to the simpsons? Peter is irresponsible and fat just like homer, but he is by no stretch of the imagination lazy like Homer and can also run without running out of breath. Homer's out of shape but Peter isn't. Meg is smart but unpopular? Since when did they ever hint her being smart? Also Meg strives to be popular her so called counterpart Lisa does not. A talkin dog, Brian who went to Brown, how does that at all compare to Santa's little helper or Snowball? The intelligent einstein, Stewie, whom always tries to make Lois' life miserable is not at all like Maggie whom loves her family and is not close to developing her motor skills. Then there's Chris, a complete moron who is unpopular and a good boy who tries hard to do what's right. This is like Bart? Um, no! Lois is 40 yetstunning and every man who meets her, wants her. She's sensible but is not at all afraid to take risks and get her hands dirty. How exactly is she like Marge?The point is is that it's funny but even funnier when you know what they're refferencing to.",5,In response to BHogg,1134518400,"12 14, 2005",2005,1983,"['Family', 'Guy', 'one', 'greatest', 'shows', 'television', 'random', 'funny', 'original', 'somehow', 'sense', 'BHogg', 'funny', 'two', 'ways', '1', 'random', 'nowhere', '2', 'Alot', 'actually', 'somewhere', 'Take', 'chicken', 'fight', 'instance', 'place', 'end', 'up', 'fighting', 'taken', 'somewhere', 'honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'everything', 'havent', 'seen', 'everything', 'were', 'refferencing', 'ending', 'scene', 'where', ""'re"", 'fighting', 'propelled', 'airplane', 'was', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'episode', 'scene', 'where', 'invited', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Super', 'Man', 'II', 'dinner', 'actress', 'out', 'when', 'mention', 'movie', 'tantrum', 'out', 'window', 'were', 'referrencing', 'fact', 'actually', 'did', 'go', 'crazy', 'making', 'film', 'crude', 'offensive', 'language', 'did', 'specifically', 'dvd.Now', 'why', 'anyone', 'compare', 'simpsons', 'Peter', 'irresponsible', 'fat', 'just', 'homer', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'lazy', 'Homer', 'can', 'also', 'run', 'running', 'out', 'breath', 'Homer', 'out', 'shape', 'Peter', ""n't"", 'Meg', 'smart', 'unpopular', 'when', 'did', 'ever', 'hint', 'being', 'smart', 'Also', 'Meg', 'be', 'popular', 'so', 'called', 'counterpart', 'Lisa', 'not', 'talkin', 'dog', 'Brian', 'who', 'went', 'Brown', 'how', 'compare', 'Santa', 'little', 'helper', 'Snowball', 'intelligent', 'einstein', 'Stewie', 'whom', 'always', 'make', 'Lois', 'life', 'miserable', 'not', 'like', 'Maggie', 'whom', 'family', 'not', 'close', 'developing', 'motor', 'skills', 'Then', 'Chris', 'complete', 'moron', 'who', 'unpopular', 'good', 'boy', 'who', 'hard', 'do', 'what', 'right', 'Bart', 'Um', 'Lois', '40', 'yetstunning', 'man', 'who', 'sensible', 'not', 'afraid', 'take', 'risks', 'get', 'hands', 'dirty', 'How', 'exactly', 'Marge', 'point', 'funny', 'even', 'funnier', 'when', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'refferencing']","Family Guy, Volume One"

I thought it was a wanna-be Simpsons. Well I, like many other people, have become a fanatic of this daring show. Since I've played the deuce out of volume 1 and 2, anything new is very welcomed. The creators really pulled out all the stops in making this DVD. It is treated like a feature film. It has a red carpet premiere with guests like the greased-up deaf guy, Kool-Aid Man, and, straight out of Chris' closet, the Evil monkey (who strikes a pose for the cameras), previews, an intermission, and a ""rap-up"" party at the Drunken Clam where the Griffin family discuss what they did during the show's cancellation (Meg did a Cher take-off for the troops and the troops took off, Lois' life really went in the sewer as one would expect. She does remind me of One Day at a Time's Bonnie Franklin). The movie is like a triple episode with all the side references one would expect from any Family Guy show. My favorites: Peter as Richard Dawson on Family Feud, what blinded Ray Charles, Stewie and Brian playing a Pac-Man game ""I'm not going to get the fruit there's a ghost right there!,"" a twisted Sam Adams commercial and Bugs Bunny finally getting what's coming to him; even the National Diabetes Assoc gets it. The wacky, waving, inflatable, arm-flailing tube man is one of the worst and most annoying. Oh, yeah, and the movie...Stewie takes swimming lessons and, in an attempt to eliminate a rival, has a near-death experience. This scare is seen as a sign for Stewie to change his ways. First, he becomes nice to the point of inducing vomit. Then he takes to the bottle (not the baby bottle) which really induces vomit. Brian takes him to a bar to make him so sick he will never drink again. Horrace the bartender asks of the baby ""Hey, is he 18?"" Brian responds, ""Horrace, the drinking age is 21."" Horrace then say ""Oh"" and leaves. After a hangover and automobile mishap, Stewie decides he needs to find himself and hopes to find someone just like him who understands him well enough to guide him. While watching the news, he spots a man in San Francisco (where else?) who looks just like him. Just a coincidence? His real father? An even closer relation? Stewie and Brian take Quagmire's ""Cross C*ntry"" RV to find out. In his quest to find himself, Stewie learns things about the future that are not at all pleasant.

There are currently two volumes out, but this is the best to start off with.  Whereas the 3rd season set has 21 episodes, this first set gives you the 7 extra episodes from their short first season.  So- same price, more episodes.That being said, this set is hilarious in every aspect.  I could spend pages of text describing individual bits of hilarity from each scene of each episode, but that would just be mundane and unneeded.  The humor ranges all over the spectrum, and some of it isn't quite suitable for younger children (if they see it, just hope they don't understand the sexual innuendo).  The commentary is funny as well, although it is only for occasional episodes in the set.  They also did an interesting thing with the commentary- it is actually rated R.  There is a warning saying that the commentary is not suitable for people under the age of 18, since they made the decision to allow profanity for the commentary.This does not bother me, but some people may be more sensitive to those kinds of things.  But if that offends you, I doubt that you'd appreciate Family Guy's humor.  The show is like a combination of The Simpsons' family based wry humor with South Park's outrageous lack of inhibitions.  All in all, it equates into hours of laughter.This DVD set is simply hilarious, as has been stated repeatedly.  If you've ever seen an episode of the show, you'd realize that.

The first season was good, and rife with plenty of jokes and wrong humor-( ex Scooby Doo meets CSI, Sesame Street meets NYPD Blue, and other other sick homages from Seth McFarlane).  Peter is the stupidist, but the funniest character.  Lois is good as the housewife with a wild streak.  But the best is Stewie, the maniacal 1 year old who considers himself free of his mom- Ovarian Bastille.  The Griffins are at their best being chased by Death, PEter going to sensitivity training/trying to breast feed Stewie himself, and of course dealing with Chris and Meg's issues.  Brian is good as the alcoholic but sharp tongued and strangely intellectual family pet.  The Family Guy is well worth the price.  Watch the old unedited versions as long as you can. Since Fox is returning them to TV, they may water down the Griffins.  I have to give McFarlane kudos for being warped and twisted enough to place Adam West (TV's Batman, as Mayor Adam West of the Griffins' hometown of Quahog, RI.)

I figured I should be straight up about my opinion now, before I start this review. I hate, hate, HATE this show. I hate the characters, I hate the laziness of the writing, I hate the voice work, and as for the animation...okay, the animation's not bad.I tried to like this show, I really did. And I tried not to judge it unfairly either as I did with South Park, a show which I originally passed judgement on without watching, and which I later recanted my opinion that it was stupid. I know when I'm wrong. And when South Park later referred to Family Guy's writers as a bunch of manatees floating beach balls filled with random non-sequiturs around in large aquarium tanks, I knew at once that I was right to recant my prejudice of South Park. Admittedly, I did the same thing with Beavis & Butthead, and upon giving that series a second chance I realized that it wasn't dumb, but that it was MAKING FUN of dumb.Family Guy, on the other hand, is just dumb.I watched about eight or nine episodes of Family Guy because, like I said, I really wanted to like it, and I wanted to be fair about it. I also made sure that the episodes spanned many of the show's different seasons, because I recognize that the first season of a TV series is never as good as the subsequent ones, and I REALLY wanted to be fair. And I did not laugh once, not once. The only time I even came close to cracking a grin was at Norm McDonald's performance as Death. Then never again. And that's because Family Guy is a truly bad show. The writing is so worthless that it defies us to laugh, and that's because the writers don't understand parody. Nor do they have to, because the fans don't care. ""Hey, you remember the time Gary Coleman and Bruce Willis went to a wrestling match and ran into Lady Gaga"" is not a parody of anything. It is not a social commentary, it is not contemporary criticism, and it is probably not even plot relevant. It's just ""stuff"" that happens, and then the episode continues on as if it didn't happen, which means every script of this show is likely a mishmash of scraps of ideas the writers fished out of the garbage and glued together.Now comes the part where defenders of the show will come at me. ""You're just too dumb to get it."" Okay, fine...then you, with your infinite intelligence, can explain it to me. Give me the SparkNotes rundown of Seth MacFarlane's genius, because not only is Family Guy terrible but the spinoffs are too. Here's another one I've heard: ""You hate the show because it's so popular,"" which of course is the dumbest defense imaginable. Here's another one I've heard: ""Family Guy is just like the Simpsons."" No. That's like comparing Coca-Cola to sugar water.I'm not asking for deep meaning in my cartoon shows. I don't tune into a TV show in the hopes of seeing Dostoevsky Theater. Sometimes I'm not even asking for meaning at all. There's no meaning in Wile E.

732858,A3JG72P0KY27HW,B000083C6V,Open Mike,"[5, 5]","My theory about Family Guy is that Seth MacFarlane (creator, animator, producer and most of the voices) ought to continue making Family Guy episodes EXCLUSIVELY to be released on DVD. That way he does not have to worry about the monkeys at the FCC or any other censorship board crawling down his throat. Family Guy is the torch bearer of adult cartoon comedy: it picks up where the sixth or seventh season of The Simpsons left off (anything after season seven is garbage, or at least inconsistent) and carries us into the 21st Century with an evolved sense of humor - infinitely more political and subversive than anything you have ever seen.The show is roughly based on the Simpsons format, or rather on the post-Reagan sitcom format consisting of a dysfunctional blue collar family, circa Rosanne and Married with Children. The father is an oaf, the kids need therapy and the mom is a classic product of the repressive 1980s model of the nuclear housewife. Add one acholohic dog and a closetted homosexual baby bent on conquering the world and you have a cast made in comic heaven. Unlike the Simpsons this series is far less realistic, with talking dogs and babies and slapstick that is totally outrageous; but similar to the Simpsons, Family Guy takes real-life scenarios such as welfare fraud, racism or sexual harassment and places them within a totally ludicrous context. Take Peter, for example, who with a 100,000$ welfare cheque purchases Michaelangelos David. I cannot get into the details of each episode, but for what this series is worth you will not be dissapointed investing in this series. Each and EVERY character is priceless and manages to make you laugh until your stomach hurts. Unlike the Simpsons, where Lisa is rarely funny and extremely irritating, Family Guy is virtually amoral (void of morals) and therefore does not rely on any characters to act as a moral anchor to compensate for the rest of the casts antics. If you like watching or listening to George Carlin, whose comedy can make your stomach turn as much as it can make you cry laughing, you will love the confrontational-meets-hysterical comedy stylings of Family Guy.

I watched the table read in the bonus section, and there were a lot of hilarious moments that could have been added to the story. Some parts on the DVD weren't all that necessary, they could have removed those and added parts from the table read, and it would have been better. I know it would have been longer, but a lot funnier, too. A lot of the extra dialogue was laugh-out-loud funny. And, there was one segment at the end of the table read that went with the first movie. Listen to it, you'll know what I mean. So I think they should go back and redo this (even though they won't, but I think it's a good idea), and add some of those segments instead. This could have been a much better movie than it was. It was still funny, but lacking a lot. I mean, it's DVD, for heaven's sake! Even a full animatic of the original concept would have been a plus. They do it for full seasons, why not a special? If you're going to put something like this out, do it right, or not at all! Don't rush it just because of the holidays.(On a side note, Another thing I'm also tired of is the stupid eco-cases. That's what this special came in, as well as a lot of other dvds. These can get your movies wrecked if you're not careful. They're not made good. I keep switching them out for regular ones that I bought.

I'm one of those people who loves a sick joke or a tasteless stab at society, and so I naturally laughed myself silly watching this show. It's a lot like ""The Simpsons"" in that it parodies a lot of things about American culture (and other cultures too) and isn't afraid to make a tasteless joke at someone else's expense.But where ""The Simpsons"" stops, ""Family Guy"" begins. Peter, one of the main characters, is even larger and dumber than Homer&#65533;almost aggravatingly so&#65533;but his stupidity contrasts well with the unexpected intelligence of Baby Stuey. Stuey is probably a year old, but he talks like a college grad and curses like a sailor. That and he's constantly plotting to kill his mom.Add to this a talking dog (who is always one to make the snide remark) and a refreshing disregard for being ""appropriate,"" and you have the greatest show that never should have been cancelled. I learned that it wasn't Fox that took the show off the air, but a dispute between the cast members.

732886,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000083C6V,Robert Moore,"[7, 8]","Above all else, FAMILY GUY is a funny, funny show.  I almost always watch TV, DVDs, or video when I eat my meals, but I have discovered that it isn't entirely safe to do so while watching this show.  It is funny to a degree that simply isn't compatible with eating food.  What is amazing about the show is that while on one level it will strike just about any viewer as a semi-ripoff of THE SIMPSONS (just check all the SIMPSONS references in other reviews--it is almost impossible not to compare the two), it nonetheless manages to come across as remarkably fresh and--paradoxically--underivative.Although the show uses a number of voiceover artists, the majority of the voices are supplied by only two actors:  Seth MacFarlane and Alex Borstein (who will be familiar to fans of MADTV).  It isn't fair to say that MacFarlane is the Matt Groening of FAMILY GUY, since Groening does so much less in the SIMPSONS.  MacFarlane is the creator of the show, voices most of the male characters, and is one of the main writers.  Alex Borstein voices most of the female characters and is also a writer.FAMILY GUY is THE SIMPSONS on speed and with a bawdy streak.  Like the Simpsons, the show recreates a small town and introduces a host of characters.  Like most people, my two favorites are Stewie, the one-year old evil super genius who also doubles as the youngest Griffin, and Brian, the talking family dog, who is also exceptionally literate and an alcoholic.  Unlike THE SIMPSONS, where Lisa and (usually) Marge are voices of reason, absolutely no one on FAMILY GUY really has their stuff together.  Brian, Meg, and Lois are relatively sane, but all can exhibit bizarre behavior at key times.  Brian can serve as the voice of reason, but his drinking problem can get out of control at inopportune times.This show is absolutely NOT for the children.  There is a huge amount of sexual humor, frequent references to genitalia, and the next-door neighbor is a sexual predator.  The show was designed with a late nighttime slot in mind, and it shows.  Much of the humor is scatological, and there really are no sacred subjects.  To be honest, when the show goes off color, I generally find it to be less funny than in the more primetime moments.  Much of the humor becomes ritualistic (a detractor might say formulaic).  For instance, whenever any character uses the phrase &quot;like the time&quot; you know you about about to get a flashback.  Transitions can be rapid, unexpected, and exceedingly weird.  And unlike THE SIMPSONS, when they introduce a song, it is almost always exceedingly funny.Just don't try to eat and watch FAMILY GUY at the same time.",5,Strikingly original and hysterically funny animation,1075507200,"01 31, 2004",2004,2651,"['else', 'FAMILY', 'GUY', 'funny', 'funny', 'show', 'almost', 'always', 'watch', 'TV', 'DVDs', 'video', 'when', 'eat', 'meals', 'have', 'discovered', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'safe', 'do', 'so', 'watching', 'show', 'funny', 'degree', 'simply', ""n't"", 'compatible', 'eating', 'food', 'What', 'amazing', 'show', 'one', 'level', 'will', 'strike', 'just', 'viewer', 'semi-ripoff', 'THE', 'SIMPSONS', 'just', 'check', 'SIMPSONS', 'references', 'other', 'reviews', 'almost', 'impossible', 'not', 'compare', 'two', 'nonetheless', 'come', 'remarkably', 'fresh', 'paradoxically', 'show', 'number', 'voiceover', 'artists', 'majority', 'voices', 'are', 'supplied', 'only', 'two', 'actors', 'Seth', 'MacFarlane', 'Alex', 'Borstein', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'fans', 'MADTV', ""n't"", 'fair', 'say', 'MacFarlane', 'Matt', 'Groening', 'FAMILY', 'GUY', 'Groening', 'so', 'much', 'less', 'SIMPSONS', 'MacFarlane', 'creator', 'show', 'most', 'male', 'characters', 'one', 'main', 'writers', 'Alex', 'Borstein', 'most', 'female', 'characters', 'also', 'writer.FAMILY', 'GUY', 'THE', 'SIMPSONS', 'speed', 'bawdy', 'streak', 'Simpsons', 'show', 'small', 'town', 'host', 'characters', 'most', 'people', 'two', 'favorites', 'are', 'Stewie', 'one-year', 'old', 'evil', 'super', 'genius', 'who', 'also', 'youngest', 'Griffin', 'Brian', 'talking', 'family', 'dog', 'who', 'also', 'exceptionally', 'literate', 'alcoholic', 'SIMPSONS', 'where', 'Lisa', 'usually', 'Marge', 'are', 'voices', 'reason', 'absolutely', 'one', 'FAMILY', 'GUY', 'really', 'stuff', 'together', 'Brian', 'Meg', 'Lois', 'are', 'relatively', 'sane', 'can', 'exhibit', 'bizarre', 'behavior', 'key', 'times', 'Brian', 'can', 'serve', 'voice', 'reason', 'drinking', 'problem', 'can', 'get', 'control', 'inopportune', 'times.This', 'show', 'absolutely', 'NOT', 'children', 'huge', 'amount', 'sexual', 'humor', 'frequent', 'references', 'genitalia', 'next-door', 'neighbor', 'sexual', 'predator', 'show', 'was', 'designed', 'late', 'nighttime', 'slot', 'mind', 'Much', 'humor', 'scatological', 'really', 'are', 'sacred', 'subjects', 'be', 'honest', 'when', 'show', 'color', 'generally', 'find', 'be', 'less', 'funny', 'more', 'primetime', 'moments', 'Much', 'humor', 'ritualistic', 'detractor', 'might', 'say', 'formulaic', 'instance', 'whenever', 'character', 'phrase', 'quot', 'time', 'quot', 'know', 'get', 'flashback', 'Transitions', 'can', 'be', 'rapid', 'unexpected', 'exceedingly', 'weird', 'THE', 'SIMPSONS', 'when', 'introduce', 'song', 'almost', 'always', 'exceedingly', 'funny.Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'eat', 'watch', 'FAMILY', 'GUY', 'same', 'time']","Family Guy, Volume One"

The show is a witty and darkly hilarious look at our society, and fans of the show (which really should be anyone with a couple of brain cells or more) should definitely pick up this terrific set.I'll pitch in a word about the DVD itself.The show is presented in its original 1.33:1 full-frame aspect ratio. The picture quality is good, although there's the occasional issue with jagged lines that occasionally appear on the earlier episodes (an issue with the animation itself?) The picture does offer the show's bright color palette though, vivid and well-saturated throughout. No instances of edge enhancement or pixelation appeared, as do on some of The Simpsons DVDs.The sountrack is Dolby 2.0 and my copy has subtitles in English, French and Spanish. The show's dialogue remains crisp and forward throughout, with the surround sound providing some reinforcement for music and occasional sound effects. Audio quality is superb, as sound effects remained clear (and occasionally punchy) throughout.Plus, the extras are great. Creator Seth McFarlane and various members of the cast and crew provide commentaries, there are over 20 deleted &quot;scenes&quot; provided in animatic (moving storyboards) form, the original pilot pitch (a rough, shortened version of the pilot episode), a 7-minute featurette on how the show pushed the envelope across its three seasons and a 17-minute documentary that takes a look at the overall series, from development to characters the voice talent.If you want to own a fab show, get these couple of seasons.

732908,A2Y4MUU6R9NDUR,B000083C6V,Shotgun Method,"[7, 8]","All hail Seth Mcfarlane, for having the balls to sell his brilliant, edgy, and endlessly hilarious animated comedy Family Guy to Fox. Too bad the boring masses were too busy watching primetime tripe like Friends (next to Ally McBeal and Seinfeld, the single most overrated and overwatched show on the face of the planet) to appreciate this gem. After being dropped by Fox twice, it's since been consigned to Cartoon Network's Adult Swim (late night programming), where it fares far better being paired up with Sealab 2021 and reruns of Futurama. Supposedly a new season is due out soon, and I can't wait.Anyway, a lot of folks pan this show as being derivative of that other pillar of edgy animated family comedy, The Simpsons. Some also believe that Trey Parker and Matt Stone's excellent (if slightly overrated) South Park is more creative and edgy. Allow me to insert my ""hurumph.""Now, while I have all the respect for Matt Groening and his now-classic show, let's be honest: The past few seasons of The Simpsons have been lacking, being full of retreaded plots and missed opportunities for humor, not to mention the fact that it's far less subversive and clever than it used to be. After over a decade of success, there's no shame in hanging up the proverbial hat.While Family Guy DOES borrow a couple of elements from The Simpsons, it is infinitely more funny, clever, and racy. Imagine The Simpsons with EVERY dysfunctional personality trait cranked to the max (and add some more psychosis, an alcoholic/socially sophisticated talking dog and a megalomaniacal/matricidal/sexually ambigious evil genius infant, to boot), a nonstop parade of pop culture references (some so damn obscure only a completely obsessive dweeb like me will get them), hiliarious guest voice appearances (ADAM WEST!!!!), ludicrous plot twists galore, and a sense of absurdity and gleefully offensive humor not seen since the heyday of Monty Python.As for South Park--make no mistake, it's often a very funny, zany experience. But the truly edgy, intelligent humor of that show is too often slathered in mounds of excessive bathroom humor that while occasionally good at netting some guilty-pleasure laughs, comes off too frequently as juvenile. I mean sure, lowbrow humor can be great, but I prefer genuine WIT, and Family Guy abounds with it. It's unrelentingly smart and never panders to its audience (maybe that's one of the reasons it got canceled). Very irreverent, razor-sharp, and often black humor is what characterizes Family Guy and separates it from the majority of lame programming out there. EVERYTHING gets a proper send-up, from The Pope to Bill Clinton to Christmas specials to the Kool Aid Guy.As far as the family itself is concerned, you know you're in for a riot when Brian, the aforementioned talking dog, is more often than not THE ONLY SANE BEING IN THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLD. And he's drunk half the time. Then you have Peter, who is like Homer with the insensitivity, cluelessness, and stupidity multiplied threefold. Chris, the equally dumb older son, with an artistic and sensitive side hidden under his inherited appreciation for bathroom jokes. Meg, the hopeless and whiny teenage outcast. Lois, the incredibly devoted wife who is equal parts oblivious and insane. And my absolute fave, Stewie...the single most quotable character in the entire show (""Damn broccoli, damn you, and DAMN THE WRIGHT BROTHERS!!""). Add some more supporting characters who are equally hiliarious (the macho wheelchair-bound police officer Joe and the total pervert sleazeball Quagmire just to name two) and you've got a show for the ages.Also notable is the fact that Mcfarlane actually voiced a good percentage of these characters. The fact that he could provide the voice for both Stewie and Brian (two extremely different voices) is pretty remarkable in of itself. I also never knew that was Seth Green voicing Chris until I looked at the credits.Anyway, I can't give Seasons 1 & 2 a perfect five, due to some episodes that aren't quite up to par and the fact that the satire would be honed to an even sharper edge on the show's third (and as of right now, final) season. Oh yeah, and I don't dig the packaging (extras are good though, especially the uncensored commentaries). But rest assured, it is a VERY high 4-star score. Like a 4.8, or something.

He then has a flashback with a five minute segment featuring him battiling a chicken on top of trucks, holding onto a helecopter, and crashing into an office building, where he slams the top of a copier machine into the chicken's head, and walks out of the hole they created saying only ""Chicken...Gave me a bad coupon""The show was apparently too controversial and was canceled, which is a shame because the show had huge potential.

This episode was needed to move the plot along to bring out the next episode, but not nearly as funny as the first one.

732912,A3VCFKG8PVV0CO,B000083C6V,Stingray Ramone,"[1, 1]","I remember during the 1999 NFL Playoffs, FOX had heavily hyped Family Guy just as much as it promoted the Super Bowl XXXIII, which of course, was a laugher.  Much like the clash between the Denver Broncos and Atlanta Falcons was nothing but hype, I was assured that Family Guy was nothing but just a Simpsons-looking ripoff.  Instead of deriding it further, I just fell in love with Family Guy, although various highly acclaimed critics and a major proportion of FOX viewers, a lot of them, Simpsons fans thought otherwise.  Furthermore, it was a darn shame that FOX did not have a whole lot of faith in the show, as it was shuffled in and out of lineups, like a baseball utility player. Sadly, instead of emerging as one of the marquee shows of the network, it was just thrown aside as an eccentric experimental show gone awry (i.e. Culture Clash, Andy Richter).  Aside from all the bad press it received, Family Guy is fresh, offensive, and just downright hysterical.  By far, it was edgier than the acceptable PG-rated norm, The Simpsons, pushing the ante for witty, satirical potty humor.Family Guy follows the Simpsonic mold of characters.  The series revolves around the Griffin family of Quahog, Rhode Island.  The patriarch is Peter, your overly healthy average joe who works at a toy company and is basically your Homer Simpson-type.  His wife is Lois, a redhead New England-accented average TV housewife.  Meg is Peter and Lois' angst-filled teenage daughter, who like most teenagers, fights the uphill battle to fit in at school.  Chris is the older son, who is a lunkhead like his old man.  Then, we have everyone's favorite cartoon infant, Stewie, a wide-headed baby who speaks eloquently with an over-the-top British accent, obsessed with killing his mother for bringing him into this world and like your typical James Bond megalomaniac, he is after world domination.  The Griffins' dog is Brian, a pooch that can walk, talk, and can become a drunken, sarcastic bum.As far as the episodes go on this DVD set, there are 28 episodes in all, Seasons 1 and 2 in their entirety.  Each episode is a guilty treat guaranteed to laugh yourself silly.  Here are my personal favorites from the first two seasons:Death Has a Shadow: The pilot episode.  Peter is fired when he shows up to work extremely hung over and he receives a $150,000 welfare check by accident.  When Lois reveals this ugly tidbit, Peter tries to save face by dumping money back to the taxpayers off a blimp over the Super Bowl.I Never Met the Dead Man: When Peter teaches Meg to drive, Peter accidentally knocks out the city's cable by colliding into a satellite dish and he makes Meg the culprit, to avoid cruel and unusual punishment.  Stewie attempts to destroy all vegetables by building a weather control device, when Lois forced him to eat his broccoli.A Hero Sits Next Door: Peter becomes annoyed of his new next-door neighbor, Joe, a handicapped man who Peter was forced to invite to play on his company's baseball team.  Because Joe emerges the sentimental favorite from his baseball-playing stint, Peter tries to become a hero by attempting to foil a bank robbery.Death is a B!tch: Peter visits the doctor, worried that he has a lump in his breast.  So that he does not have to pay a cent, Peter proclaims himself dead.  Much hilarity ensues when Death attempts to claim Peter afterward.The King Is Dead: Lois is the new artistic director of the Quahog Players theatre group and she plans to direct The King and I as her first production.  For Peter to stop annoying her, Lois makes him the producer and he converts The King and I into a raunchy cyborg fighting extravaganza.Road to Rhode Island: If I had to pick my very favorite episode, it's this one.  Brian goes to pick up Stewie from visiting his grandparents in Palm Springs, and they miss their flight home due to Brian's drunkenness.  The two set off back home on a heck of an adventure.  Meanwhile, Lois forces Peter to watch relationship communication tapes, which turn out to be porn.You can make a viable case for each episode to be a favorite because each one is laugh-out-loud funny, of course, some more than others. In summation, Family Guy is a very well-developed, well-executed comedy, which should be taken with light-hearted humor through its peak moments of rudeness.  It is a hysterical riot worthy of a second crack on the airwaves, but since the likeliness of that happening looks bleak, there is more incentive into buying this extremely enjoyable DVD set.",5,"Too Insensitive, Too Satirical, and Too Good for Network TV",1055548800,"06 14, 2003",2003,4518,"['remember', '1999', 'NFL', 'Playoffs', 'FOX', 'had', 'heavily', 'hyped', 'Family', 'Guy', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'promoted', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'XXXIII', 'course', 'was', 'laugher', 'Much', 'clash', 'Denver', 'Broncos', 'Atlanta', 'Falcons', 'was', 'nothing', 'hype', 'was', 'assured', 'Family', 'Guy', 'was', 'nothing', 'just', 'Simpsons-looking', 'ripoff', 'Instead', 'deriding', 'further', 'just', 'fell', 'love', 'Family', 'Guy', 'various', 'highly', 'acclaimed', 'critics', 'major', 'proportion', 'FOX', 'viewers', 'lot', 'Simpsons', 'fans', 'thought', 'otherwise', 'Furthermore', 'was', 'darn', 'shame', 'FOX', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'whole', 'lot', 'faith', 'show', 'was', 'shuffled', 'lineups', 'baseball', 'utility', 'player', 'Sadly', 'instead', 'emerging', 'one', 'marquee', 'shows', 'network', 'was', 'just', 'thrown', 'aside', 'eccentric', 'experimental', 'show', 'gone', 'awry', 'i.e', 'Culture', 'Clash', 'Andy', 'Richter', 'bad', 'press', 'received', 'Family', 'Guy', 'fresh', 'offensive', 'just', 'downright', 'hysterical', 'far', 'was', 'edgier', 'acceptable', 'PG-rated', 'norm', 'Simpsons', 'pushing', 'ante', 'witty', 'satirical', 'potty', 'humor.Family', 'Guy', 'Simpsonic', 'mold', 'characters', 'series', 'Griffin', 'family', 'Quahog', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'patriarch', 'Peter', 'overly', 'healthy', 'average', 'joe', 'who', 'toy', 'company', 'basically', 'Homer', 'Simpson-type', 'wife', 'Lois', 'redhead', 'New', 'England-accented', 'average', 'TV', 'housewife', 'Meg', 'Peter', 'Lois', 'angst-filled', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'who', 'most', 'teenagers', 'uphill', 'battle', 'fit', 'school', 'Chris', 'older', 'son', 'who', 'lunkhead', 'old', 'man', 'Then', 'have', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'cartoon', 'infant', 'Stewie', 'wide-headed', 'baby', 'who', 'eloquently', 'over-the-top', 'British', 'accent', 'obsessed', 'killing', 'mother', 'bringing', 'world', 'typical', 'James', 'Bond', 'megalomaniac', 'world', 'domination', 'Griffins', 'dog', 'Brian', 'pooch', 'can', 'walk', 'talk', 'can', 'become', 'drunken', 'sarcastic', 'bum.As', 'far', 'episodes', 'go', 'DVD', 'set', 'are', '28', 'episodes', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'entirety', 'episode', 'guilty', 'treat', 'guaranteed', 'laugh', 'silly', 'Here', 'are', 'personal', 'favorites', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Death', 'Shadow', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Peter', 'fired', 'when', 'up', 'work', 'extremely', 'hung', '150,000', 'welfare', 'check', 'accident', 'When', 'Lois', 'ugly', 'tidbit', 'Peter', 'save', 'face', 'dumping', 'money', 'back', 'taxpayers', 'off', 'blimp', 'Super', 'Bowl.I', 'Never', 'Met', 'Dead', 'Man', 'When', 'Peter', 'Meg', 'drive', 'Peter', 'accidentally', 'out', 'city', 'cable', 'colliding', 'satellite', 'dish', 'culprit', 'avoid', 'cruel', 'unusual', 'punishment', 'Stewie', 'destroy', 'vegetables', 'building', 'weather', 'control', 'device', 'when', 'Lois', 'forced', 'eat', 'broccoli.A', 'Hero', 'Sits', 'Next', 'Door', 'Peter', 'annoyed', 'new', 'next-door', 'neighbor', 'Joe', 'handicapped', 'man', 'who', 'Peter', 'was', 'forced', 'invite', 'play', 'company', 'baseball', 'team', 'Joe', 'sentimental', 'favorite', 'baseball-playing', 'stint', 'Peter', 'become', 'hero', 'attempting', 'foil', 'bank', 'robbery.Death', 'B', 'tch', 'Peter', 'doctor', 'worried', 'lump', 'breast', 'So', 'not', 'have', 'pay', 'cent', 'Peter', 'dead', 'Much', 'hilarity', 'ensues', 'when', 'Death', 'attempts', 'claim', 'Peter', 'afterward.The', 'King', 'Dead', 'Lois', 'new', 'artistic', 'director', 'Quahog', 'Players', 'group', 'direct', 'King', 'first', 'production', 'Peter', 'stop', 'annoying', 'Lois', 'producer', 'King', 'raunchy', 'cyborg', 'fighting', 'extravaganza.Road', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'had', 'pick', 'very', 'favorite', 'episode', 'one', 'Brian', 'pick', 'up', 'Stewie', 'visiting', 'grandparents', 'Palm', 'Springs', 'miss', 'flight', 'home', 'due', 'Brian', 'drunkenness', 'two', 'set', 'off', 'back', 'home', 'heck', 'adventure', 'Meanwhile', 'Lois', 'forces', 'Peter', 'watch', 'relationship', 'communication', 'tapes', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'porn.You', 'can', 'make', 'viable', 'case', 'episode', 'be', 'favorite', 'one', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'course', 'more', 'others', 'summation', 'Family', 'Guy', 'very', 'well-developed', 'well-executed', 'comedy', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'light-hearted', 'humor', 'peak', 'moments', 'rudeness', 'hysterical', 'riot', 'worthy', 'second', 'crack', 'airwaves', 'likeliness', 'happening', 'bleak', 'more', 'incentive', 'buying', 'extremely', 'enjoyable', 'DVD', 'set']","Family Guy, Volume One"

732934,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B000083C6V,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[0, 0]","Movie - 3.5Having been merely an off/on viewer of Family Guy throughout the last few years, I find it a bit surprising that for as few episodes as I've seen that I still like the show a lot, yet won't go out of my way to catch up on the ones I've missed. I only discovered Blue Harvest two years ago (a year after it actually came out) and finally got around to watching both it and Something (x3) Dark Side a few weeks ago. With that said, I'm also a big Star Wars fan (grew up watching the original trilogy many, many times as a kid). Combine the raunchy, vulgar, witty, humor and repetitious mannerisms of Peter and company with the ageless classic and you've got quite the satirical homage. Essentially, you get the mixed bag of potty-mouth dialogue, wordplay, and slapstick shenanigans any Family Guy fan would expect, only it's all been re-adapted. Characters from the show play themselves under the guises of their supposed Star Wars counterparts, and do so pretty well. It's not so much a retelling of George Lucas' epic sci-fi tale, so much as it is a long episode of Family Guy using those elements to entertain us. It's not a flat-out parody like Spaceballs either, but it's fun to watch for both its quirkiness to the new and respect to the old. Some of the jokes and one-liners are hit or miss leading to laugh-out-loud moments or complete and utter silence, while some of the characters' actions are just blatantly vulgar for no reason (perhaps to surprise the audience since this is normally edited for TV), though I'd offer to wage MacFarlane just wanted to get the unrated jitters out of his system. I'm also a bit disappointed that both this and Blue Harvest were only limited to 2 acts instead of 3. Not that I want them to make full-length features or anything, but for something as contextually rich as Star Wars I think a longer run time could've benefited for a much more entertaining event. But alas, this is all there is, and we'll just have to wait for the Return of the Jedi parody.Video - 4.5While it's only 2D animation and at an aspect ratio of 1.33:1, Dark Side looks remarkably good. Colors are especially vibrant in recreating the Family Guy color palette, while at the same time showing a great amount of line detail in the backgrounds and Star Wars designs of the feature itself. I especially thought some of the more action-packed animation sequences had a very fluid presentation to them and made for an overall pleasant picture. There are very few instances of any real problems like blocking, aliasing, or other artifacts, though there may be some slight banding in the sky of Cloud City, but it's not too noticeable unless you're actually looking for imperfections. If anything, the only real downside to the video is the 4:3 format. The presentation itself looks fantastic, but the black bars on the side kind of make you wish they had utilized that extra space to make a more spacious and fulfilling image. Other than that, great job by Fox.Audio - 4.5For the Star Wars fan in me, I was stoked to hear John William's score in lossless audio. The main theme, Imperial March, and other classic pieces are recreated to sonic perfection and sound absolutely stunning as a substitute for the real thing until Lucas decides to get off his butt and start remastering a Star Wars' BD release. Sound effects have a good deal of depth and dimensionality as well, with separation coming off mostly from the front, and a little bit on the sides. Dialogue is clear, though a smidgen too loud from the center, sometimes overpowering the rest of the sound field and even causing me to turn down the volume at points. LFEs aren't too frequent, but given this was a TV show the overall sound design still possesses excellent fidelity, while at the same time giving you a sample of what Star Wars will hopefully sound like when it comes to BD.Extras - 3.0The special features are pretty limited. Topping it is a very entertaining commentary with a big chunk of the crew responsible for making this and Seth Green. It's informative, fun to listen to, and a good supplement for the product itself. Other specials include a table read of the unfinished script, the surprisingly detailed making-of for the poster art, a Pop-up Video-esque factoid feature for the film, an animatic comparison, and a very short preview for the upcoming Return of the Jedi spoof. All of the video stuff is in HD, and while somewhat lacking overall, is still a good deal for such a short movie.Overall - 4.0If you like Family Guy and Star Wars equally, this is definitely worth checking out. If you're not quite either, then some of the mixed elements from each might be a turn off. I personally Dark Side to be pretty funny, albeit a little misfiring at some points and way too short overall. But it makes for some good laughs if you're feeling the mood for that sort of humor.

Where The Simpsons can be somewhat edgy without treading on thin ice, Family Guy takes those extra steps and dances all over the ice with glee.Family Guy is the birthchild of Seth MacFarlane and focuses on the daily trials and tribulations of the Griffin family.  The patriarch of the family is Peter Griffin (voiced by MacFarlane), a Homer Simpson-type dad who is a little dim-witted but can sometimes find a bright spot in any situation (as noted constantly by the flashbacks he and the other members of the family get in each episode).  Along for the ride are Peter's long-suffering wife Lois, their pet dog Brian who through some strang ability is able to talk with the family, and their three children: Meg, who is going through all the teenage angst that most girls her age go through; Chris, the seemingly dumb son who has some hidden talents, and last but certainly not least Stewie, a little cutie with the mind and motives of a megalomaniacal tyrant in the making.Family Guy was initally a hit, but Fox was afraid that censors would pounce all over the show and did virtually everything to make the show unwatchable by viewers.  Finally succeeding, the show was cancelled in 2000 and didn't gain success until Cartoon Network made the show part of it's Adult Swim lineup a little over a year ago.  When ratings for the airings on CN went through the roof and the sales of the DVD sets (this one and Volume 2)skyrocketed, Fox realized it made a terrible error in judgement (no surprise!) and decided to bring the show for a new series run sometime next year.For those of us who can't wait until then, the first DVD box set contains the first 28 episodes of Family Guy over its first 2 seasons (the first season only ran 7 episodes, the other 21 comprise season two)and are some of the most hilarious of the series.  Needless to say that they also spawned some of the most classic lines in Family Guy history, especially Stewie's response to Lois' advice that he go outside and play: ""Why don't you burn in HELL?!?"".  In addition, if you don't find yourself dying of laughter from the scene in ""I Am Peter, Hear Me Roar"" where Peter tries to breast-feed Stewie (yes, you read that right), you need a serious humor transfusion.If you consider yourself a fan of the series or you've just heard from word of mouth that this series is hilarious, get this set to see what all the fuss is about.",5,The Simpsons with some serious bite...,1099440000,"11 3, 2004",2004,2560,"['Family', 'Guy', 'Simpsons', 'what', 'Mustang', '5.0', 'base', 'model', 'Mustang', 'same', 'style', 'just', 'little', 'extra', 'edge', 'advantage', 'lot', 'better', 'Where', 'Simpsons', 'can', 'be', 'somewhat', 'edgy', 'treading', 'thin', 'ice', 'Family', 'Guy', 'extra', 'steps', 'dances', 'ice', 'glee.Family', 'Guy', 'birthchild', 'Seth', 'MacFarlane', 'daily', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'Griffin', 'family', 'patriarch', 'family', 'Peter', 'Griffin', 'voiced', 'MacFarlane', 'Homer', 'Simpson-type', 'dad', 'who', 'little', 'dim-witted', 'can', 'sometimes', 'find', 'bright', 'spot', 'situation', 'noted', 'constantly', 'flashbacks', 'other', 'members', 'family', 'get', 'episode', 'ride', 'are', 'Peter', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'Lois', 'pet', 'dog', 'Brian', 'who', 'strang', 'ability', 'able', 'talk', 'family', 'three', 'children', 'Meg', 'who', 'going', 'teenage', 'most', 'girls', 'age', 'go', 'Chris', 'seemingly', 'dumb', 'son', 'who', 'hidden', 'talents', 'last', 'certainly', 'not', 'least', 'Stewie', 'little', 'cutie', 'mind', 'motives', 'megalomaniacal', 'tyrant', 'making.Family', 'Guy', 'was', 'initally', 'hit', 'Fox', 'was', 'afraid', 'censors', 'would', 'pounce', 'show', 'did', 'virtually', 'everything', 'make', 'show', 'unwatchable', 'viewers', 'Finally', 'succeeding', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', '2000', 'did', ""n't"", 'gain', 'success', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'made', 'show', 'part', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'lineup', 'little', 'over', 'year', 'ago', 'When', 'ratings', 'airings', 'CN', 'went', 'roof', 'sales', 'DVD', 'sets', 'one', 'Volume', '2', 'skyrocketed', 'Fox', 'realized', 'made', 'terrible', 'error', 'judgement', 'surprise', 'decided', 'bring', 'show', 'new', 'series', 'run', 'sometime', 'next', 'year.For', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'then', 'first', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'first', '28', 'episodes', 'Family', 'Guy', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'first', 'season', 'only', 'ran', '7', 'episodes', 'other', '21', 'comprise', 'season', 'two', 'are', 'most', 'hilarious', 'series', 'Needless', 'say', 'also', 'spawned', 'most', 'classic', 'lines', 'Family', 'Guy', 'history', 'especially', 'Stewie', 'response', 'Lois', 'advice', 'go', 'outside', 'play', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'burn', 'HELL', 'addition', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'dying', 'laughter', 'scene', 'Am', 'Peter', 'Hear', 'Me', 'Roar', 'where', 'Peter', 'breast-feed', 'Stewie', 'yes', 'read', 'right', 'need', 'serious', 'humor', 'transfusion.If', 'consider', 'fan', 'series', ""'ve"", 'just', 'heard', 'word', 'mouth', 'series', 'hilarious', 'get', 'set', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'about']","Family Guy, Volume One"

Time's up and the Family Guy's version is here with SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING DARK SIDE.  Currently, this hour-long episode hasn't aired yet and at the moment is only available on DVD and Blu-ray (but we all know Seth MacFarlane is just as big a money machine as George Lucas and the episode will play either on tv or cable at some point).The story begins the same as BLUE HARVEST did with the power going out and Peter Griffin entertaining the family by continuing the story of Star Wars, but with some particular Family Guy twists.  Darth Vader (Stewie) is using the full control of the Empire to find the Rebel Alliance and wipe them out once and for all.  Luke (Chris) wants to be a Jedi, while Han (Peter) and Leia (Lois), Chewie (Brian), and C-3PO (Quagmire) try to evade the Empire, eventually escaping to Cloud City to visit with Han's old friend Lando (Mort Goldman).SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING DARK SIDE does a good job at staying true to the Star Wars saga and continuing the story began in BLUE HARVEST, while interjecting various pop culture allusions and typical Family Guy humor.  Just as THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is a better movie than STAR WARS, so is SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING DARK SIDE a better episode than BLUE HARVEST.  BLUE HARVEST is about 8 minutes shorter in length than SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING DARK SIDE, but there are times in BLUE HARVEST where the plot drags a bit. That doesn't happen in SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING DARK SIDE; scenes move quickly from one to the next, the gags don't stop, and the story moves along at a brisk pace.My favorite scene in the episode is when Yoda is training Luke.  The scene is done as a montage and is intersected with the actual music and footage of the Russian Boxer Drago training in ROCKY IV. The juxtaposition is hilarious.The extras on the DVD include a commentary, an option of playing the episode with pop-up facts (and unlike most DVDs with this feature, you can actually fast forward through the episode and still read the pop-ups), a table reading sneak peak of WE HAVE A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS (the Family Guy take on RETURN OF THE JEDI), and a featurette with the creators of the SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING DARK SIDE poster.Overall, this DVD is something that appeals to both Family Guy and Star Wars fans.

732941,A29HPI08Z5SYYX,B000083C6V,Tyler Foster,"[48, 100]","Family Guy didn't always suck. The original run of three seasons resulted in a crude, yet sharp and very funny animated TV show. It wasn't a classic, but it was funny, and its not-so-lofty goals were achieved with energy to spare.But when it popped back on television a few years after cancellation, it was never going to work, and doesn't. The new Family Guy is a weak rip-off of the original, forcing the ""obscure-but-cool"" pop culture references down the audience's throat and then drawing each unfunny joke or reference (mainly to itself) out to excruciating length. It's not enough to be rude and outrageous just for the sake of it, the new Family Guy has to rub it in our faces, leaving a bad taste in the viewer's mouth.Of anything that's been produced during the New Family Guy reign, this movie is by far the worst. The episodes range from the rare B+'s to the all-too-common D's, but this movie is an easy D-, representing the worst newly-released feature-length comedy I've seen in five years. I know I'm going to get scathed by hordes of 15 and 16-year-olds who revere the show as some sort of comedic Holy Grail, but despite the promise of ""unhelpful"" tagging, I'll say it again for the cheap seats: this movie sucks.The movie wallows in a string of unfunny movie premiere jokes before finally gearing into a subpar plot that strings three seemingly rejected episodes of the show together into something about as unimpressive as that sounds. Everything feels like it got sent to the animation house during the script's first draft, much like any given episode of the new show. Yes, there are a handful of amusing jokes -- but I laughed about as much as I would watching any one episode of original Family Guy. Considering the film is three times as long and crammed wall-to-wall with gags, this is not a particularly flattering ratio. The movie also throws in some truly gratuitous musical numbers as well, which the show itself would go on to do with alarming frequency.I know it's not a popular opinion, but it's true -- it just ain't the same. When it comes to comedy, while hilarity is subjective, laziness is not, and this movie is lazy. Whether or not you laugh (and, I reiterate, I didn't), the effort put forth by the filmmakers is very weak, and I fully expect that within a few years, once the hype over the show's return has died down and people are actually trying to rewatch and love the new episodes they thought were great in the way they rewatched and loved the old episodes, they'll find there's a lot less meat on the bones than meets the eye.",1,Someday you'll all realize it...,1127347200,"09 22, 2005",2005,2574,"['Family', 'Guy', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'suck', 'original', 'run', 'three', 'seasons', 'resulted', 'crude', 'yet', 'sharp', 'very', 'funny', 'animated', 'TV', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'classic', 'was', 'funny', 'not-so-lofty', 'goals', 'were', 'achieved', 'energy', 'spare.But', 'when', 'popped', 'back', 'television', 'few', 'years', 'cancellation', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'work', ""n't"", 'new', 'Family', 'Guy', 'weak', 'rip-off', 'original', 'forcing', 'obscure-but-cool', 'pop', 'culture', 'down', 'audience', 'throat', 'then', 'drawing', 'unfunny', 'joke', 'reference', 'mainly', 'excruciating', 'length', 'not', 'enough', 'be', 'rude', 'outrageous', 'just', 'sake', 'new', 'Family', 'Guy', 'rub', 'leaving', 'bad', 'taste', 'viewer', 'mouth.Of', 'anything', 'been', 'produced', 'New', 'Family', 'Guy', 'reign', 'movie', 'far', 'worst', 'episodes', 'range', 'rare', 'B+', 'all-too-common', 'D', 'movie', 'easy', 'D-', 'representing', 'worst', 'newly-released', 'feature-length', 'comedy', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'five', 'years', 'know', ""'m"", 'going', 'get', 'scathed', 'hordes', '15', '16-year-olds', 'who', 'revere', 'show', 'sort', 'comedic', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'promise', 'unhelpful', 'tagging', ""'ll"", 'say', 'again', 'cheap', 'seats', 'movie', 'movie', 'wallows', 'string', 'unfunny', 'movie', 'premiere', 'jokes', 'finally', 'gearing', 'subpar', 'plot', 'three', 'seemingly', 'rejected', 'episodes', 'show', 'together', 'something', 'as', 'unimpressive', 'Everything', 'feels', 'got', 'sent', 'animation', 'house', 'script', 'first', 'draft', 'much', 'given', 'episode', 'new', 'show', 'Yes', 'are', 'handful', 'amusing', 'jokes', 'laughed', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'watching', 'one', 'episode', 'original', 'Family', 'Guy', 'Considering', 'film', 'three', 'times', 'long', 'crammed', 'wall-to-wall', 'gags', 'not', 'particularly', 'flattering', 'ratio', 'movie', 'also', 'truly', 'gratuitous', 'musical', 'numbers', 'as', 'well', 'show', 'would', 'go', 'do', 'alarming', 'frequency.I', 'know', 'not', 'popular', 'opinion', 'true', 'just', 'ai', ""n't"", 'same', 'When', 'comedy', 'hilarity', 'subjective', 'laziness', 'not', 'movie', 'lazy', 'not', 'laugh', 'reiterate', 'did', ""n't"", 'effort', 'put', 'forth', 'filmmakers', 'very', 'weak', 'fully', 'expect', 'few', 'years', 'once', 'hype', 'show', 'return', 'died', 'down', 'people', 'are', 'actually', 'trying', 'rewatch', 'love', 'new', 'episodes', 'thought', 'were', 'great', 'way', 'rewatched', 'loved', 'old', 'episodes', ""'ll"", 'find', 'lot', 'less', 'meat', 'bones', 'eye']","Family Guy, Volume One"

732943,A2OCJNB6B46OKP,B000083C6V,"Underground Reborn ""gnome""","[0, 0]","Well it has arrived, the second instalment in the Family Guy Star Wars project. Now that I have finally seen it after months of anticiaption I have to say it was good, but it was definitely not what Empire was to New Hope.First and foremost, this second installment was not going to be a surprise like the first one was. 'Something 3X Darkside' was based on the exact same map as 'Blue Harvest' Macfarlane and company stuck true to the origional film using their infamous humor and pop culture references. I will say there were some moments that caused me to laugh a lot so that was a plus. Another plus was the new characters introduced to play the rolls of the new Star Wars characters...yes even Meg makes her triumphant return. Still, there are some flaws here. I think that this new installment could have been a little different. An example would be how Peter tells the story, it didn't have to be another blackout. Also, the end of the episode ends up in another battle between Chris and Peter about Robot Chicken which makes no sense what so ever because Seth MacFarlane has plenty of Roles on Robot Chicken so Ihave no idea why he takes shots at it. Most importantly as a Family Guy fan I am not a fan of the fact that Stewie is an ambiguously gay character.

I've yet to figure out why anyone likes the show for any reason, least of all the humor. The show does have one redeeming quality, the voice acting. Seth MacFarlane, Seth Green and others do excellent work that I normally find funny, but the talent is wasted on this nonsense.I love comedy and animation and am a fan of many animated comedy shows: The Simpsons, South Park, Futurama, Venture Bros., Robot Chicken, Bullwinkle and others, and I have yet to see anything in Family Guy that makes it worth watching once, let alone repeatedly on DVD. The jokes are strained and have nothing to say, unlike the dark, incisive humor one finds in early The Simpsons, or on Futurama or South Park.

732946,A2I2HDCI4LJYNU,B000083C6V,"voodoochild ""random person""","[6, 23]","This is a blantant rip-off of the Simpsons. First off, yes this is a funny show, but it is only funny rarely and really only because of Seth Green and Alex Borstein.First off all, animated primetime shows were a dyind arts for 30 years before The simpsons came along, saved animated shows, became the 2nd greatest show ever (2nd to Monty Python) and unfortunatley inspired other people to make there other, most of them unfunny. The only really funny ones were Futurama and The Critic which wee Simpson spinoffs really anyway. Family Guy is one of those unfunny rip offs like American Dad which was on for about 3 weeks.)The Simpsons in seasons 3-6 did ""cutaways"", which were short bits that were unrelated. They were funny. This show copied it and did it for a few times for some laughs, but now the show is half cut aways and hardly any story. Mostly uneccisary nudity is what this show is now.Peter Griffin is fat, stupid, drinks at the local bar with his two friends one black one white, and loves his family in his white shirt and blue pants. So does Homer Simpson.Lowes Griffin is struggling to keep up with her three kids. So is Marge Simpson.Meg Griffin is a misfit, can't get a boyfriend, is unpopular and is the most ignored family member. So is Lisa Simpson. Do you see the patern now?What made me do this review was an outrage I had while watching the new one today. The fourth season episode ""Marge in Chains"" is an episode in which Marge goes to jail for shoplifting, meets friends in prison, and at home everything falls apart including the people. The one on a few hours was exacty the same. Are the low-brow devoted fans ever gonna wake up? Many of them are Simpson fans, so you'd think they'de have noticed by now, but are most likely denying it.This show has only gotten worse over time. I liked it when it first came out. The show has been less funny by now, like the Simpsons did, but that took over a decade, this show has only been on 5 years. When the season premire came out this year, it was the most unfunny thing. It was worse than friends for crying out loud. Jokes about cripples, Jesus on a cross (which is funny only if it goes so far, but this is just blashemous) and kids dying of cancer. That's not dark humor, just disgusting. It seems that to get attention, this show feels the need to try to shock it's audience for publicity or to possibly get more blockheads to buy the DVDs who enjoy constant fart jokes.The next day i mentiond to my friend about how bad that season opener was, and he a devoted fan claimed it was the worst episode they'd ever done.Besides a small amount of these early episodes being funny, it gets two stars for it's ""Monty Python's Meaning of Life"" parody I saw on adult swim.So this show will now go into the category of 7-10pm sunday night shows, that have long been burned out, that's now being called ""Animation Domination. FOX has been trying to fill that 9pm spot after Malcolm in the Middle which if anybody noticed is live action. You should go on the internet and dicover how many shows have gone in that spot and been cancelled before there first season ended. Make a drinking game of it.So in conclusion, please don't purchase this DVD if you want smart, satirical humor that never ages wit constant topical jokes. Check out The Simpsons, Monty Python, MR. Show, Seinfeld, even the Honeymooners.

Oh well, we now have this four-disc set to remind just what we've been missing since ""Family Guy"" was finally taken off the air.  While ""Family Guy"" certainly bears more than a token resemblance to ""The Simpsons,"" it distinguished itself by being even more random and outrageous than its animated predecessor.  Peter Griffin, the title character, basically IS Homer Simpson, except fatter, stupider, and more irresponsible.  Fortunately, ""Family Guy"" also shares ""The Simpsons""' subtle, irreverent brilliance.  Every few seconds brought another unpredictable gag, bizarre flashback, pop-culture parody, or social-historical reference.  While the episodes had plots, they basically unfolded in free-flowing stream-of-consciousness format, making it virtually impossible to tell what was coming next.  ""Family Guy"" spits out jokes so rapid-fire that you can barely even process it all.  Sometimes I've missed one crack because I was still laughing at the previous one.  Of course, the solution is to watch over and over again, which I'm sure I'm going to wind up doing.  Although it makes a great family comedy, ""Family Guy"" is successful mainly as a grand satire of American culture.  The show is constantly casting light on just how shallow, excessive, and flat-out stupid our society can be.

Meg gets a job at a diner, and when she realizes that she can make extra money in tips by telling people that her little brother (Stewie) is addicted to crack, he gets sent to a foster home.Death is a [...] - Peter goes to the hospital when he thinks he may have cancer, and when he doesn't, he doesn't feel like paying the outrageous hospital bills. So he pretends to be dead. But what he doesn't know is that Death has to come and get him now, and in a freak accident, the rules of death no longer apply.All the episodes on FAMILY GUY: VOLUME ONE are hilarious, and I just wish I had seen the show earlier.

It feels however, not so much a film as three episodes following the same story put together.The same humour is used, but cleverly avoids falling into the trap of being the same joke repeated over and over again. As with any Family Guy show, the humour is a little risque, sometimes offensive, but always very funny. Many of the small bit-part characters (some of whom only make one appearance in the TV show,) are also given small bit parts in the film.As with the TV show, there are often little random scenes to explain jokes, and in this film, they are more frequent, and much more random, but still work all the same. The bulk of the film revolves around Brian and Stewie, which is never a bad thing. In short, if you like Family Guy, or can appreciate a childish sense of humour with many adult themes, then you will love this film.",5,Very Funny,1150848000,"06 21, 2006",2006,958,"['much', 'awaited', 'Family', 'Guy', 'film', 'really', 'very', 'similar', 'TV', 'series', 'like', ""'ll"", 'also', 'however', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'three', 'episodes', 'following', 'same', 'story', 'put', 'together.The', 'same', 'humour', 'used', 'cleverly', 'avoids', 'falling', 'trap', 'being', 'same', 'joke', 'repeated', 'over', 'again', 'Family', 'Guy', 'show', 'humour', 'little', 'risque', 'sometimes', 'offensive', 'always', 'very', 'funny', 'Many', 'small', 'bit-part', 'characters', 'whom', 'only', 'make', 'one', 'appearance', 'TV', 'show', 'are', 'also', 'given', 'small', 'bit', 'parts', 'film.As', 'TV', 'show', 'are', 'often', 'little', 'random', 'scenes', 'explain', 'jokes', 'film', 'are', 'more', 'frequent', 'much', 'more', 'random', 'still', 'work', 'same', 'bulk', 'film', 'Brian', 'Stewie', 'never', 'bad', 'thing', 'short', 'like', 'Family', 'Guy', 'can', 'appreciate', 'childish', 'sense', 'humour', 'many', 'adult', 'themes', 'then', 'will', 'love', 'film']","Family Guy, Volume One"

732954,AP3B615GM191G,B000083C6V,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","While watching the first Star Wars parody, Blue Harvest, from the creators of Family Guy, I was struck by the originality of the ""episode"" (competition with Robot Chicken aside!).  Just seeing Peter as Han Solo, Brian as Chewbacca, Quagmire as C3PO, and Cleveland as R2-D2, among others, was enough to bring a smile to my face.  It was one thing to develop those characters on a weekly TV series, but a whole different thing entirely to take that character development and use it to make fun (and pay tribute to) the first Star Wars film.In this second spoof, ""Something, Something, Something, Dark Side"", the Family Guy team sends-up The Empire Strikes Back.  Since that first shock-value of seeing all our favorite characters in the Star Wars universe is gone, it is more up to the jokes than ever, as sight gags just weren't going to cut it anymore.  With that being said, this entry into the FG cannon performs about as well as anything else...some jokes are brutally offensive, others fall completely flat, and still others are so funny that you'll be chuckling out loud and almost miss the next one!  Really, the success of the TV show stems from the fact that creator Seth McFarlane and Co. know no bounds in terms of poking fun at anything and everything, and that is once again the case here.Basically, this was another funny little entry into the FG universe (literally!) that does pretty much what it is supposed to do.  Fans of the show will eat it up (awkward moments and all), while non-fans will probably find it offensive and turn it off.",4,"Novelty Is Gone, But Still Funny",1263859200,"01 19, 2010",2010,1554,"['watching', 'first', 'Star', 'Wars', 'parody', 'Blue', 'Harvest', 'creators', 'Family', 'Guy', 'was', 'struck', 'originality', 'episode', 'competition', 'Robot', 'Chicken', 'aside', 'Just', 'seeing', 'Peter', 'Han', 'Solo', 'Brian', 'Chewbacca', 'Quagmire', 'C3PO', 'Cleveland', 'R2-D2', 'others', 'was', 'enough', 'bring', 'smile', 'face', 'was', 'one', 'thing', 'develop', 'characters', 'weekly', 'TV', 'series', 'whole', 'different', 'thing', 'entirely', 'take', 'character', 'development', 'use', 'make', 'fun', 'pay', 'tribute', 'first', 'Star', 'Wars', 'film.In', 'second', 'spoof', 'Something', 'Something', 'Something', 'Dark', 'Side', 'Family', 'Guy', 'team', 'sends-up', 'Empire', 'Strikes', 'Back', 'first', 'shock-value', 'seeing', 'favorite', 'characters', 'Star', 'Wars', 'universe', 'gone', 'more', 'up', 'jokes', 'ever', 'sight', 'gags', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'going', 'cut', 'anymore', 'being', 'said', 'entry', 'FG', 'cannon', 'performs', 'as', 'well', 'anything', 'else', 'jokes', 'are', 'brutally', 'offensive', 'others', 'fall', 'completely', 'flat', 'still', 'others', 'are', 'so', 'funny', ""'ll"", 'be', 'chuckling', 'loud', 'almost', 'miss', 'next', 'one', 'Really', 'success', 'TV', 'show', 'fact', 'creator', 'Seth', 'McFarlane', 'Co.', 'know', 'bounds', 'terms', 'poking', 'fun', 'anything', 'everything', 'once', 'again', 'case', 'here.Basically', 'was', 'funny', 'little', 'entry', 'FG', 'universe', 'literally', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'supposed', 'do', 'Fans', 'show', 'will', 'eat', 'up', 'awkward', 'moments', 'non-fans', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'offensive', 'turn', 'off']","Family Guy, Volume One"

Anyway, Family Guy ranks among the greatest television shows ever produced. I have loved the show for a very long time, and used to watch it when it was on Fox (and will again once it comes back) which was when I was in 4th and 5th grade (I'm an 8th grader now). Even though I didn't get almost all of the show's references (the few I got were ones aimed at things any 4/5th grader should know as well as the All in the Family and Jeffersons references), but I still loved the show. I guess I must've understood half of the jokes. Not most of the references, and not ones involving stuff I shouldn't have known back then. Anyway, I loved the show, and it was horrible to see it leave. I can't even describe the rush of excitement and joy I felt when I heard that opening song for the first time in almost two years (on Adult Swim). Two years that had gone by with no way for me to see the show. Oh, it was great. The episode I saw is one of the best episodes of the show, ""I Am Peter, Hear Me Roar."" I can't wait for the new season, which MacFarlain describes as ""Bigger than Jesus.""Anyway, Family Guy accomplishes what most shows cannot. Multiple laughs per a minute. I guarantee that in only fifty episodes you'll laugh almost as many times as you will watching every episode of South Park (slight Exaggeration there). Most of Family Guy's jokes are when a character references something that happened to them in the past, and then we see a short flashback that ends up being hilarious. The bad thing about this, though, is when you're watching other shows and they reference something that happened to them in the past, you expect them to jump to a flashback and they disappointingly do not.Anyway, Family Guy is a hilarious, brilliant show and this set contains the first 2 seasons (28 episodes: Season 1-7 episodes-Season 2-21 episodes), hitting its stride during the second season. Please enjoy this 4-disc set.
