1153332,A2BD0G4SRK0WMV,B0016GOJYA,CodeMaster Talon,"[16, 16]","You know you are watching a great film when at a critical point your friend falls off the couch you are sitting on, crawls on her knees to the TV, grabs the screen and proceeds to yell at the movie. That is greatness my friends. ""Dhoom:2"" is far and away, hands down, no debate about it the most wonderful Bollywood film I have ever seen. Reaching heights of loopiness unheard of in western film, Dhoom 2 is flat-out goofy until it gradually becomes genuinely compelling. If you have never seen a Bollywood film and are looking for a place to start, please please do yourself the enormous favor of paying a few dollars to buy this film.Abhishek Bachchan stars as Jai, a straight-edge cop on the hunt for Mr. A, the world's most successful thief (Hrithik Roshan; much more on him in a minute). He is hampered in his quest by his inept friend Ali (Uday Chopra, so painfully unfunny he elicits an occasional chuckle) and aided by his beautiful partner Shonali (Bipasha Basu, in a thankless dual role). Things get complicated when a second thief, Sunehri, (Aishwarya Rai) shows up, determined to catch the attention of Mr. A (and fellas, I think you must admit her plan to get his attention is pretty darn good, especially the outfit.). As is typical in Hindi films, subplots are abandoned half-way through the film and characters disposed of at whim, although you probably won't care as long as the focus remains on our two thieves. The chemistry between Rai and Roshan is white hot and their evolving attraction is the beating heart of the story.And now, a paragraph devoted entirely to Hrithik Roshan. I'm not going to mince words here; Roshan is the most beautiful man alive. He is heart-stoppingly, soul-crushingly gorgeous. He is also a great dancer, a talented actor and constantly exhibits a mischievous sense of humor. In every one of his films he exudes manliness and authority even when forced by the script to do incredibly silly things (""Dhoom:2"" has Roshan dressing up as the Queen of England and strumming a mandolin as one of Snow White's Seven Dwarfs. And still, so sexy.). In short, Roshan in this film and indeed in all his films embodies my idea of how a man should think, act, and oh most especially, look. Watch the way he holds Aishwarya Rai's face as he tells her her life belongs to him. See his stricken look as he spies on her from the Rio Carnival parade (sparking my little sister to wonder ""why she doesn't notice the incredibly hot clown."") Witness his kitchen rebellion and demands for payment. Who wouldn't give this man anything he asked for? Especially if he asked for that?Great dance numbers, fantastic soundtrack, brilliantly shot, well-acted, cheesy, sweet, romantic, and in the end, mesmerizing. I can't recommend this movie enough. If Hollywood insists on churning out ""romantic comedies"" that posses neither romance nor comedy, you have to look elsewhere. Look here.GRADE: A+ Two words for you: Wet. Basketball.(PS For further viewing of Hrithik Roshan, please watch ""Krrish"", a cross between ""George of the Jungle"", ""Superman"" and ""Paycheck"". It must be seen to be believed.)",5,"""He's the perfect thief!""",1281312000,"08 9, 2010",2010,3114,"['know', 'are', 'watching', 'great', 'film', 'when', 'critical', 'point', 'friend', 'couch', 'are', 'sitting', 'crawls', 'knees', 'TV', 'grabs', 'screen', 'proceeds', 'yell', 'movie', 'greatness', 'friends', 'Dhoom:2', 'far', 'away', 'down', 'debate', 'most', 'wonderful', 'Bollywood', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Reaching', 'heights', 'loopiness', 'unheard', 'western', 'film', 'Dhoom', '2', 'flat-out', 'goofy', 'gradually', 'genuinely', 'compelling', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Bollywood', 'film', 'are', 'looking', 'place', 'start', 'please', 'please', 'do', 'enormous', 'favor', 'paying', 'few', 'dollars', 'buy', 'film.Abhishek', 'Bachchan', 'Jai', 'straight-edge', 'cop', 'hunt', 'Mr.', 'A', 'world', 'most', 'successful', 'thief', 'Hrithik', 'Roshan', 'much', 'more', 'minute', 'hampered', 'quest', 'inept', 'friend', 'Ali', 'Uday', 'Chopra', 'so', 'painfully', 'unfunny', 'occasional', 'chuckle', 'aided', 'beautiful', 'partner', 'Shonali', 'Bipasha', 'Basu', 'thankless', 'dual', 'role', 'Things', 'get', 'complicated', 'when', 'second', 'thief', 'Sunehri', 'Aishwarya', 'Rai', 'up', 'determined', 'catch', 'attention', 'Mr.', 'A', 'fellas', 'think', 'must', 'admit', 'plan', 'get', 'attention', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'especially', 'outfit.', 'typical', 'Hindi', 'films', 'subplots', 'are', 'abandoned', 'half-way', 'film', 'characters', 'disposed', 'whim', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'as', 'long', 'focus', 'two', 'thieves', 'chemistry', 'Rai', 'Roshan', 'white', 'hot', 'evolving', 'attraction', 'beating', 'heart', 'story.And', 'now', 'paragraph', 'devoted', 'entirely', 'Hrithik', 'Roshan', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'mince', 'words', 'here', 'Roshan', 'most', 'beautiful', 'man', 'alive', 'heart-stoppingly', 'soul-crushingly', 'gorgeous', 'also', 'great', 'dancer', 'talented', 'actor', 'constantly', 'mischievous', 'sense', 'humor', 'one', 'films', 'manliness', 'authority', 'even', 'when', 'forced', 'script', 'do', 'incredibly', 'silly', 'things', 'Dhoom:2', 'Roshan', 'dressing', 'up', 'Queen', 'England', 'strumming', 'mandolin', 'one', 'Snow', 'White', 'Seven', 'Dwarfs', 'still', 'sexy.', 'short', 'Roshan', 'film', 'indeed', 'films', 'embodies', 'idea', 'how', 'man', 'should', 'think', 'act', 'most', 'especially', 'look', 'Watch', 'way', 'Aishwarya', 'Rai', 'face', 'life', 'belongs', 'See', 'stricken', 'look', 'Rio', 'Carnival', 'parade', 'sparking', 'little', 'sister', 'wonder', 'why', ""n't"", 'notice', 'incredibly', 'hot', 'clown', 'Witness', 'kitchen', 'rebellion', 'demands', 'payment', 'Who', 'would', ""n't"", 'give', 'man', 'anything', 'asked', 'Especially', 'asked', 'Great', 'dance', 'numbers', 'fantastic', 'soundtrack', 'brilliantly', 'shot', 'well-acted', 'cheesy', 'sweet', 'romantic', 'end', 'mesmerizing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'enough', 'Hollywood', 'churning', 'out', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'romance', 'comedy', 'have', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'Look', 'here.GRADE', 'A+', 'Two', 'words', 'Wet', 'Basketball', 'PS', 'further', 'viewing', 'Hrithik', 'Roshan', 'please', 'watch', 'Krrish', 'cross', 'George', 'Jungle', 'Superman', 'Paycheck', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed']",N/A
1153333,A2UJG6T6DOWKQF,B0016GOJYA,Jennifer Hopfinger,"[2, 2]","Action has long been a flourishing genre in Bollywood, but it is perhaps the genre least associated with Hindi film in the minds of Westerners. But however incongruent action and musical numbers may seem at first, the two are perfect compliments--both are spectacles, after all--as evidenced in any number of Hindi action flicks, including one of the finest, 'Dhoom 2.'It doesn't happen often, but sometimes the sequel is better than its predecessor, and while the action hit 'Dhoom' (2004) is solidly entertaining, the second installment far surpasses it.Abhishek Bachchan reprises his role as police detective Jai Dixit. Uday Chopra is back as Ali, a reformed small-time crook who has earned a spot on the police force. Rimi Sen returns, briefly, as Jai's wife Sweety, who is now pregnant and even more relegated to the sidelines of Jai's life than she was in the first movie.Three new characters are introduced. Shonali (Bipasha Basu) is a police investigator and Jai's old college friend. Ali--still a failure with women but ever hopeful--has a major crush on her, but she only has eyes for Jai. His marriage is in no danger though--at least from infidelity--Jai is as indifferent to Shonali's charms as he is to his wife's. The two villains are Aryan (Hrithik Roshan), known in the beginning only as ""A,"" a tech wiz and master of disguises who breaks into high-security places all over the world, and Sunehri (Aishwarya Rai), a copycat thief who's trying to beat Aryan to the prizes.Aryan is a bored genius who craves stimulation and only feels challenged by near-impossible heists. At different times, he impersonates a goofy teenager, an austere priest, a doddering janitor, and Queen Elizabeth II. Roshan assumes each identity with a glee that reveals Aryan's childlike spirit. Physically, though, he's quite a specimen of a man, and he shows off his ripped bod every chance he gets. He develops a white-hot connection with Sunehri, his adversary-turned-partner, who impresses him with her boldness, tenacity, and stunning beauty. (The two share a passionate kissing scene that was controversial because of its intensity.)Once again, the dull, glum Jai seems like no match for the colorful criminals, but he's sneaky smart, always thinking several moves ahead of his opponent--and the audience. Jai and Ali follow the thieves from Mumbai to Rio, where they are planning to steal rare coins from a museum. ('Dhoom 2' was the first major Hindi film to be shot in Brazil, where Bollywood is quite popular.)When Aryan and Sunehri aren't snatching priceless valuables and running from the cops, they burst into song, to revel in all the fun they're having. Roshan dances with rubbery, muscled abandon, and Rai swirls in his arms--not in saris but sassy outfits--to catchy pop tunes on MTV-style sets--before dashing off again, with Jai hot on their heels.- The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:The Bollywood Ticket)",5,Must See,1259712000,"12 2, 2009",2009,2950,"['Action', 'long', 'been', 'flourishing', 'genre', 'Bollywood', 'perhaps', 'genre', 'least', 'associated', 'Hindi', 'film', 'minds', 'Westerners', 'however', 'incongruent', 'action', 'musical', 'numbers', 'may', 'seem', 'first', 'two', 'are', 'perfect', 'compliments', 'are', 'spectacles', 'evidenced', 'number', 'Hindi', 'action', 'flicks', 'including', 'one', 'finest', '2', ""'It"", ""n't"", 'happen', 'often', 'sometimes', 'sequel', 'better', 'predecessor', 'action', 'hit', ""'Dhoom"", '2004', 'solidly', 'entertaining', 'second', 'installment', 'far', 'it.Abhishek', 'Bachchan', 'role', 'police', 'detective', 'Jai', 'Dixit', 'Uday', 'Chopra', 'back', 'Ali', 'reformed', 'small-time', 'crook', 'who', 'earned', 'spot', 'police', 'force', 'Rimi', 'Sen', 'returns', 'briefly', 'Jai', 'wife', 'Sweety', 'who', 'now', 'pregnant', 'even', 'more', 'relegated', 'sidelines', 'Jai', 'life', 'was', 'first', 'movie.Three', 'new', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'Shonali', 'Bipasha', 'Basu', 'police', 'investigator', 'Jai', 'old', 'college', 'friend', 'Ali', 'still', 'failure', 'women', 'ever', 'hopeful', 'major', 'crush', 'only', 'eyes', 'Jai', 'marriage', 'danger', 'least', 'infidelity', 'Jai', 'as', 'indifferent', 'Shonali', 'charms', 'wife', 'two', 'villains', 'are', 'Aryan', 'Hrithik', 'Roshan', 'known', 'beginning', 'only', 'A', 'tech', 'wiz', 'master', 'disguises', 'who', 'breaks', 'high-security', 'places', 'world', 'Sunehri', 'Aishwarya', 'Rai', 'copycat', 'thief', 'who', 'trying', 'beat', 'Aryan', 'prizes.Aryan', 'bored', 'genius', 'who', 'stimulation', 'only', 'feels', 'challenged', 'near-impossible', 'heists', 'different', 'times', 'goofy', 'teenager', 'austere', 'priest', 'doddering', 'janitor', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'Roshan', 'identity', 'glee', 'Aryan', 'childlike', 'spirit', 'Physically', 'though', 'quite', 'specimen', 'man', 'ripped', 'bod', 'chance', 'white-hot', 'connection', 'Sunehri', 'adversary-turned-partner', 'who', 'boldness', 'tenacity', 'stunning', 'beauty', 'two', 'share', 'passionate', 'kissing', 'scene', 'was', 'controversial', 'intensity', 'Once', 'again', 'dull', 'glum', 'Jai', 'match', 'colorful', 'criminals', 'sneaky', 'smart', 'always', 'thinking', 'several', 'moves', 'ahead', 'opponent', 'audience', 'Jai', 'Ali', 'follow', 'thieves', 'Mumbai', 'Rio', 'where', 'are', 'planning', 'steal', 'rare', 'coins', 'museum', '2', 'was', 'first', 'major', 'Hindi', 'film', 'be', 'shot', 'Brazil', 'where', 'Bollywood', 'quite', 'popular', 'When', 'Aryan', 'Sunehri', 'are', ""n't"", 'snatching', 'priceless', 'valuables', 'running', 'cops', 'burst', 'song', 'revel', 'fun', ""'re"", 'having', 'Roshan', 'rubbery', 'muscled', 'abandon', 'Rai', 'swirls', 'arms', 'not', 'saris', 'sassy', 'outfits', 'catchy', 'pop', 'tunes', 'MTV-style', 'sets', 'dashing', 'off', 'again', 'Jai', 'hot', 'heels.-', 'Bollywood', 'Ticket', 'American', 'guide', 'Indian', 'movies', 'Subscribe', 'Bollywood', 'Ticket']",N/A

1153337,A6M5U2YWC3YFF,B0016GOJYA,Timothy Liebe,"[4, 4]","As a Bollywood version of a slam-bang action-packed mindless fun ride, DHOOM 2 certainly delivers. It's got mad (sometimes CGI-aided, sometimes not) stunts, high-octane action sequences, some cute comedy bits, and very catchy musical numbers extremely-well danced. It's got a talented and engaging cast with Abhishek Bachan returning as ""Supercop"" Jai Dixit and Uday Chopra as his comic relief partner Ali, the charismatic and athletic Hritikh Roshan as gentleman ""Superthief"" Mr. A, the stunning Aishwarya Rai as cocky female thief Sunehri who has some secrets of her own, and Bipasha Basu in a fun double role as Dixit's college sweetheart Deputy Superintendent Sonali Bose and her comically Americanized sister/cousin/who cares Monali - so Ali can have a love interest just as silly as himself for once! As Indian fans have pointed out, the only thing missing is a coherent script - there are excellent dramatic and romantic bits as well as the expected action and comedy ones, but the plot barely holds together and doesn't even pretend to have more than a vague acquaintance with its predecessor, DHOOM.Even so, I'd have given this movie four stars rather than three simply because it's a delightful example of its genre-bending - a hilariously testosterone'd cop adventure, with singing, dancing and get-out-your-hankies melordrama. However, it appears that Amazon has misrepresented this as a two-disc set, when there's only one disc in the package. I sent the first one back and got a (one-disc) replacement, so I know it wasn't just a glitch in shipping - they're not selling the two-disc set advertised at double the cost of the one-disc set also available here.

1153338,AUQAL4MV2CM2R,B0016GOJYA,"Warp Girl ""warpgirl""","[0, 0]","Okay, as I've said before I believe that to truly get maximum pleasure out of a cinematic experience, one must first accept the film for what it is. If you go to a Summer Blockbuster expecting a transformative piece of art, then you'll be disappointed. That said, the Summer Blockbuster shouldn't be dismissed either, just coordinating the stunts and explosions is hard work, and they still entertain. Let me put it another way, Da Vinci created art that set the standard for centuries, Andy Warhol made a statement with a Campbell's soup can, both are the masters of their unique artistic spectrums.This is my long-winded way of saying Dhoom 2 is a darn good Campbell's soup can. Does it have an impressive script? Nope. Are the characters well developed? Not particularly. Does this movie make you think? Definitely not! It does entertain you and that's the point of a great action flick.This was also my first time seeing Abhishek Bachchan (the son of legendary Amitabh Bachchan, and now hubby to Aishwarya Rai) and I have to admit it took seeing a few Salman Khan movies to appreciate that he's not quite as dull as my first impression said he was. Only Mr. Salman Khan is a worse dancer, with a more limited emotional acting range. (Just my personal opinion and he has produced some AWESOME movies) Sad to say, although Mr. Bachchan Jr. is technically the ""hero"" in this film he's swallowed up by the charisma of his future bride, and Mr. Roshan. Jai Dixit has only three emotions, anger, disgust, and contempt. Contempt is the one he offers to friends and loved ones. All others get disgust and anger.Uday Chopra has such a bad reputation as an actor and it's *completely* undeserved! I cheerfully admit that Ali irritates the heck out of me, and if I hadn't seen him in films likeMohabbatein Bollywood DVD With English SubtitlesPyaar Impossible(which he wrote) andMujhse Dosti Karoge Bollywood DVD With English SubtitlesI'd fall victim to categorize him as an over-the-top actor as well. But the truth is he's a dang genius who not only writes and directs movies but he's developed his own comic book company! Unfortunately, even in his native land he's lampooned as an acting failure, and it's widely reported that he won't act in any other films aside from the Dhoom franchise. Since his work will be focused behind the camera from now on, I urge people to not judge him solely as Ali and give his other work a shot both on screen and off.Bipasha Basu has a double role as ACP Shonali Bose and her twin sister Monali. I have to say, she is a beautiful lady, but as an actress and a dancer she leaves me cold. As Shonali she's more repressed than any Vulcan and not nearly as interesting. And there's the fact that she shamelessly flirts with soon-to-be-father, and very married Jai (who himself deserves worst-husband-of-the-century) without any real sparks. As Monali she's slightly more engaging because it's fun to watch Jai's reactions to her air-headedness. It's the only time in the movie that Mr. Bachachan Jr. conveys any genuine emotion (disgust). However, there is one reason she deserves a little shout out. According to reports she lived on oranges for four days before her bikini shots. I don't care what they'd pay me there's no way I'd EVER do that! I hope they paid her well.I have to say that my main interest in this movie was born from falling in love with Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai inJodhaa Akbar (Three-Disc Collector's Edition). Frankly they're the reason this film works as well as it does. Without these two playing the antagonists there's nothing to lose myself in as an audience. Ali is simply too foolish, and Jai is so cardboard that I have absolutely no way of connecting to them emotionally. Normally, I'd blame this on the script, but in this case it boils down it the illusive, indefinable, ""IT"" factor. Mr. Bachchan Jr. simply doesn't have ""IT"" in this film, meanwhile Mr. Roshan and Ms. Rai have so much ""IT"" that it allows them to take two character outlines and make you care without knowing anything about them. We're never told why they do what they do, we're never told how they became what they are, we're never even privy to their surnames! It doesn't matter, once Sunehri and Aryan come together it's their movie.One can't talk about this movie without discussing the infamous kiss between Ms. Rai and Mr. Roshan, what to people in the USA would regard as something chaste and benign was called up before the courts in India, recently the now Mrs. Bachchan has said that she had her doubts the kiss would be well received when she did it, and felt the hoopla proved her right. Frankly, I was disappointed that felt that way because it's a gorgeous scene, but I give her kudos for going for it despite her reluctance.Ms. Rai's portrayal of Sunerhi is a demonstration of just how good of an actress she is. She's one of a very select group of actors who understand and use their eyes and bodies to their full potential in a performance. Now you might think I've lost my marbles for this one but hear me out... Look at a film like the incomparableGuzaarish (English Subtitles)and notice how she's used her voice differently, her gait and her body language is different, even the way she sits and eats are totally different. Guzzarish is the superior film and role no question, but it's equally hard to create something out of fluff. It's true Sunehri's primary function in the film is to be the sexy temptress, but Ms. Rai embraces the role, and retains her own elegance and innate dignity, which makes her the perfect mate for Aryan. My one complaint is that her dancing talent is tragically misused by the choreographer. She should have been able to bust out some flashy moves on par with her leading man. If you have the two best dancers in film paired with each other USE THE OPPERTUNITY. Her great dancing moments are during the end credits!Which brings me to Mr. Roshan, he's labeled as a so-called ""negative character"" but to me he's the real hero here. His character, unlike Jai Dixit has no backstory whatsoever. He's as mysterious at the end of the movie as he is at it's start, but his emerald eyes pull you into his heart and the way his brain works. Considering he has less dialogue than any other character Mr. Roshan has to rely on his face and body for the bulk of his performance. This is why he's rightly hailed as ""India's most complete actor"" I've yet to see any other Bollywood actor with a more thorough understanding of how to convey emotion through his eyes. To tell the truth, I can't think of many actors in this day and age anywhere who approach Mr. Roshan's talent of expression. It's this talent that ground Mr. A as a person, otherwise the character and his robberies would be so fantastical that he'd be just as remote as Jai Dixit. Since Mr. Roshan and Ms. Rai share the same level of talent, they're able to bring a certain level of depth to the movie without destroying the ""good time, no thinking, all entertainment, purpose of the film."" Oh and he deserves all the applause in the world for the makeup and disguises he dons in this. The man had to get acrylic nails! Speaking as someone who's endured the horror of acrylic nails, my heart bled for him! I assure you, they're far worse than hanging off a cliff.As far as the soundtrack goes, it's the perfect score for the movie. The songs are sexy without being vulgar. They're perfect for a rocking party, and a great blend of the Hindi film experience and spicy Latin beats of Carnival. The only weak track for me was Touch Me Don't Touch Me, but that might be because it's the only dance number I didn't like.One quick note about the basketball game, my mother (Mrs. My-High School-Records-Still-Stand) bashes the basketball game every time she sees it.
