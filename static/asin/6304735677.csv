Although it can be considered a family film, the many scenes of violence (and a couple of sexual ones), make it viewing for a more mature audience. Recommended for ages 12 (14 for boys), and older. Descretion advised.The overall production is superb. As is the acting. I watched all 3 hours of it, straight thru. It was entirely enthralling.Historically enlightening, the film shows how rugged the pioneer women of Texas were. They were more than tough, they were superwomen.A sweeping epic that encompasses a generation of 3 Texas pioneer familes, it adeptly shows the inside look at the Muscogee Creek 'Trail of Tears' (from Georgia), the War with Mexico, the defense against vindictive Commanche, and the homefront battles during the Civil War. All from the women's perspective. Relating their sacrifices, friendships and family life, as they strive to survive some of the most grueling times, of the early years of Texas.Angelina Jolie and Annbeth Gish both show their broad range as actors, but i think it was the character of Dana Delaney that was the anchor of the film. Although she smokes a pipe like a man, she is reserved & resourceful...and although tender as a wife, mother and sister, yet she's as tough as nails when it comes to defending her loved-ones. Willing to sacrifice her own life in doing so. I loved that about her.This film accurately portrays what pioneers were really like.

If I hadn't been doing a search for movies with Tina Majorino (Corrinna, Corrinna) I would never have discovered it -- and yet here are three of my favorite women stars: Dana Delany, Tina Majorino, and Angelina Jolie, all together in one big beautiful package! And in my favorite genre, too! A family of women building the country together, facing hostile Indians, the question of slavery, the brutality of life in a time of hard work and multiple hardships. Women and children died more often than not, and survival is the key to success in those times. I loved the historic context, and the delicately drawn complexities of the issues, from Indians to slavery to war to suffrage. It's all in there. Why this movie got next to no publicity is beyond me.What does puzzle me is the fabulous Indian &quot;Tarantula.&quot; I don't know who played him. He's not listed on the box, nor in the credits -- none of the &quot;Indians&quot; are. He was magnificent. I would love to know who he was/is.I would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in the side of history we don't get enough of: &quot;herstory.&quot; And of course, to fans of Angelina Jolie. She's as fabulous in this movie as she is in any of her others, and plays a role quite distinct from what you may be used to. Her character is complex, admirable, and made me think and question everything I thought I knew about Southern women. In fact, she brought a bit of &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; to the role, without being too obvious about it.Dana Delaney carries the movie from beginning to end and is as wonderful, believable, powerful and sexy as she is in China Beach.

This was one of the worst ""movies"" I have ever seen.It was depressing with no hope of a good ending right from the start. There was absolutely no plot whatsoever.

Phemie's father has just died and she must go to Texas to live with her older sister Sarah, who is already a mother.  Phemie finds herself in the middle of the U.S. Mexican War and she watches in awe as her sister leads the women pioneers to safety while their men heroically defend their homes.  Georgia, back in Georgia :-), is experiencing some very horrific acts on prejudice.  She herself is part Native American so her family is in great danger.  The girls grow up in this young and troubled nation, and reunite to fight against the prejudice and other social issues.This film is truly inspirational and has lots of action, so I think guys will enjoy it too!  ;-)  The cast includes Angelina Jolie and young Rachael Leigh Cook (the grown-up and little Georgias, respectively).

This movie had potential to be a really good movie and covered some important American history, but lacks significant content. It fairly skips over the civil war, and most of the second part of the movie deals with reconstruction.Dana Delany's character was a bit incredibile. She plays a super-human woman who is rather unbelievable. Her acting left a little to be desired also. The other actors however, did the best that could have been done with the script. There are some very redeamable parts of this movie, and some good acting,scenery, and wardrobe.

I found a VHS version of this at a booksale last weekend and was stunned at its brilliance for a second time.  The grit of these people: White, Black, Native American, young and old is wonderfully told in 180 minutes that fly past.  I am so glad I found this and I'm literally begging you to buy this movie. It is nonstop adventure while at the same time, delivering history from another point of view.  Two people really stand out: Dana Delany as Sarah and Michael Greyeyes as Tarantula.

434382,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,6304735677,Tsuyoshi,"[41, 46]","Hallmark Entertainment offers a sweeping drama about the three women living in the South, from the time of ""Alamo"" to the Civil War.  I am afraid that your teacher of history cannot allow you to use this TV series as a text for American history, and that is simply because it is too melodramatic, in the fashion of that famous Margaret Michell's book.  The story is too fast; the characters are too many; but the film never stops, and something happens every ten minutes -- war, lynch, dead bodies (including children), commentary about slavery, rights for women to vote, human rights for native Americans.  In a sense, this is a modern version of ""Gone with the Wind"" with smaller scale.Georgia and Euphemia are good friends, but the latter is forced to leave her in order to go to Texas (until then, it takes only ten minutes).  The film traces the life of the two women  separately until their reunion of many years later.  Now Georgia and Euphemia (with her independent sister) are both grown up, after the happy and sad times, and as you will expect, their environments changed what they once were; though they know they are no longer the best friends who played together by the peaceful riverside, they come to understand each other after the many plights of life in time of war.There are so many events that happen every five minutes (as the editorial review say rightly) that it is impossible for me to summerize the whole story.  The film goes just like turning pages of paperbacks: now you see delightful scenes, and suddenly, a war or epidemic breaks out.  Now you see Georgia meets a man, and next, you see their pledge of love.  The film gives no time to think.  But that is probably the point.So, it would be best for us to see the actors.  Angelina Jolie and Anabeth Gish are both good, and it is a bit surprise that their characters in childhood are played respectively by lovely Rachel Leigh Cook and Tina Majorino (who stole every scene from Kevin Costenr in ""Waterworld.""  Male character players like Powers Boothe and Tony Todd appear, alongside with Micheal York, but their roles are smaller they should be.  But it is a film about women, and female players all shine, of course, with Dana Delaney.So, see this one as such, as a melodramatic rendition of the Southern history.  It is a laudable attempt to spotlight the women's roles in the Western genre, but perhaps the film gives you an impression that there is another way of describing it.  My honest feeling is that ""True Women"" works as a melodrama, and women's life of this time, which deserve our attention more, should be treated with deeper characters and a slower story.
