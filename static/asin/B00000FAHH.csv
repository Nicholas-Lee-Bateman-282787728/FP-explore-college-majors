An animated story line ties together a very good look at the how and why of various  important functions and considerations of planning a Roman city.  The  audio-visual work is high class!  Some adults expressed regret that there  wasn't more animation!  They enjoyed the story telling as well as the  students.

As the empire expanded, these engineers planned and built cities throughout three continents that had logic, that had ample water by way of aqueducts, that had water distribution systems, sewers, paved streets with curbs and devices to slow traffic, public baths and public toilets, buildings devoted to culture and entertainment, warehouses, shops, homes and tenements. When the empire fell apart, it took 1,400 years for Western civilization to meet the challenges of urban living which the Romans had met.Roman City was a PBS production built around David Macaulay's illustrated book, City: A Story of Roman Planning and Engineering. Macaulay is a writer and illustrator who is fascinated by how things work. He also is a first-rate teacher, able to describe and show concepts and techniques so they are understandable and fascinating. Roman City, with Macaulay as narrator, opens up his book with location shots at several ancient Roman cities such as Pompeii, Herculaneum and Ostia, as well as with illustrations taken from the book and with animation. We get to see why Roman cities were laid out the way they were and how important arches and concrete were. As with the book, the program tells the story of the planning, building and growth of the fictional city of Verbonia in Gaul, beginning with the decision of Caesar Augustus to establish the city in 27 B.C. The cast of characters includes the animations of young Marcus Fabricius (voiced by Derek Jacobi), the engineer charged with designing and building the city; Gaius Verlius (voiced by Brian Blessed), the former general appointed by Caesar to run Verbonia; and Caesar Augustus himself (voiced by Ian McKellan). The story line works up to a point. The device of the fictitious Fabricius and Verlius helps to personalize the problems and decisions. On the other hand, there are side issues -- the conflicts between the Gauls and Romans, the hatred of the Druids, the corruption of officials -- which, in my view, become distractions to the fascination of how things were actually built. A couple of the fictional secondary characters quickly become irritating when they show up for some humor.On balance, I think this is an hour-long program that fans of engineering and ancient Rome will enjoy. I did. But I'd encourage anyone who gets this to also get a copy of David Macaulay's book. It's excellent throughout with none of the distractions. PBS also did programs based on three other outstanding Macaulay books, Pyramid, Castle and Cathedral.The DVD presentation looks good.

The animation here is of a superior quality to past versions of Macaulay's books and the story of the founding of the city, a subversive movement by local Celtic druids, and the plot to take the life of the visiting Caesar Augustus, all of these are new to the film.

I felt that this aspect of the video might make it more viewable for children.While it does not delve deeply into Roman history, it does cover as many aspects of the Roman City as can be expected in 60 minutes.Extremely informative and fun, I would recommend this video to adults and children alike because it lays a fair foundation for understanding ancient Rome.  The documentary also does not focus strictly on architecture, but also discusses Rome's control of other areas, such as Gaul, and guesses at the points of view of the conquered through the animated story.While I did find David Macaulay's attempts at jokes slightly gauche, they did not take away from the overall educational, intriguing quality of the documentary.While I assume that the animated sections of the film would make it more appealing to teachers and students, I also found that these sections contained educational value as well.  Still, I would say that the informative, live-action segments of the film are more useful on the subject.Overall, this is a great documentary explaining the Roman City in a format people of all ages can enjoy.",4,Interesting Use of Animation to Liven Up History,1081728000,"04 12, 2004",2004,1336,"['found', 'documentary', 'very', 'interesting', 'bit', 'dry', 'dull', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'be.This', 'due', 'part', 'use', 'animation', 'further', 'increase', 'viewers', 'understanding', 'Roman', 'City', 'history', 'felt', 'aspect', 'video', 'might', 'make', 'more', 'viewable', 'children.While', 'not', 'delve', 'deeply', 'Roman', 'history', 'cover', 'many', 'aspects', 'Roman', 'City', 'can', 'be', 'expected', '60', 'minutes.Extremely', 'informative', 'fun', 'would', 'recommend', 'video', 'adults', 'children', 'alike', 'fair', 'foundation', 'understanding', 'ancient', 'Rome', 'documentary', 'also', 'not', 'focus', 'strictly', 'architecture', 'also', 'Rome', 'control', 'other', 'areas', 'such', 'Gaul', 'guesses', 'points', 'view', 'conquered', 'animated', 'story.While', 'did', 'find', 'David', 'Macaulay', 'attempts', 'jokes', 'slightly', 'gauche', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'overall', 'educational', 'intriguing', 'quality', 'documentary.While', 'assume', 'animated', 'sections', 'film', 'would', 'make', 'more', 'appealing', 'teachers', 'students', 'also', 'found', 'sections', 'contained', 'educational', 'value', 'as', 'well', 'Still', 'would', 'say', 'informative', 'live-action', 'segments', 'film', 'are', 'more', 'useful', 'subject.Overall', 'great', 'documentary', 'explaining', 'Roman', 'City', 'format', 'people', 'ages', 'can', 'enjoy']",Roman City VHS

Wonderful, fun, good for boys or girls.  The DVD tries to put a story in there - and it takes up alot of the time instead of explaining about how the city was built.  I want to see them making the roads, designing the sewers, the crowded marketplaces, the busy streets, the water system!  And yet we get a story.  True, Brian Blessed is one of the voices, and the author does give us a tour of some Roman ruins while explaining how the cities worked but still, the book is better.  Kids may still enjoy the DVD, but only if you give it to them BEFORE the book.  And I do suggest gettingCity: A Story of Roman Planning and Construction.  It is worth it.
