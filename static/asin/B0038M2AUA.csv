1331800,AKZGOBZGR1WA3,B0038M2AUA,A.K.A. Me,"[11, 14]","From the moment I saw a teaser for American Pickers in December, I couldn't wait to see the first show. As a former flea market and yard sale addict, I miss the days when you really could find some amazing pieces of American history or pop culture at such venues. But those days were gone decades ago. So the thought that I could enjoy that vicariously through this show was pretty intriguing.And it did not disappoint. American Pickers is everything I hoped for and more. Mike and Frank really know their stuff, and the people they come across in their travels are a breed of American which is quickly disappearing...along with the treasures they have hidden in barns, garages, old opera houses, and even tunnels!One of the charming attributes of this series is the way Mike and Frank relate to each other. There are none of the insane ego dramas which plague-no, make that completely destroy-other reality shows. And over the time that these two have worked and traveled together, they have developed a language all their own-something I have experienced myself with my business partner. It's very real, and quite funny at times. (I especially like when the guys are freestylin').The pieces of history they unearth are truly amazing! Bicycles, scooters, motorcycles and sidecars. Visible gas pumps, a giant advertisng character with a movable arm. And don't forget Frank's favorites...oil cans, big little, round, square and beautifully kept or beautifully rusted. They even found a man who collects BUILDINGS! That's right, he has a White Castle hamburger joint in his front yard, and the General Store he shopped in as a boy in his back yard-fully stocked, of course-along with quite a few more buildings from his home town.I love this show. I hope it comes back for many more seasons. One disturbing thing I noticed at the end of the first season was a switch to 1/2 hour shows. PLEASE, DO NOT MESS WITH THIS NEARLY PERFECT JEWEL OF A SHOW!

Because of that I can not comment on the quality of the dvd or if the complete show from the series was included.I appreciate how they will often try to educate someone about what they have before they start making offers. I also appreciate that when they do come upon a once in a life time gem (a dino bone in season 4 or 5?) they are willing to donate it to a museum or hook it up with someone who might appreciate the item.Another aspect that I like about this show is their truly friends. You know they have been friends for a long long time because they joke and tease like only a pair can after being friends for so long. I appreciate how Mike is trying to help Frank at times (For example, in one season by giving him tapes to learn new techniques).It is difficult for me to comment on only season one because we have jumped around watching this so much.

They took it home and  got it appraised; $5000.

This is the premise of ""American Pickers,"" two antiques and collectible hunters from Iowa who go around in a white van and buy (or try to buy as is sometimes the case) what most people would call junk...and turn it around for a buck.Along the way, they meet some of the strangest assortment of fellow collectors from the Midwest and the South, some of whom are friendly and some...not so much.  We get to see strange folk art, a man who has created his own underground maze, and are given information on old cars, motorcyles, bicyles, oil cans, toys, advertising signs and objects, and much much more.This is not really the kind of show where you sit down and watch it more than once, but it is interesting for those who are into antiques, especially old vehicles.  The guys are fun to watch as they kid each other and Danielle, the girl back at their main base in LeClaire Iowa, who helps guide them to their next visit and sell and restore some of what they bring back.  Sometimes, they take a hit and sometimes they take a miss.  Sometimes, they manage to buy something and sometimes the person whose junkyard or collection they are viewing just can't let go of anything, even if their entire home or every rotting outbuilding they own is jam-packed with stuff.The show can be sad at times, especially when you see people who are essentially hoarders being unable to sell anything or when you see their wives or kids trying to deal with their accumulation of stuff.  Other times, its fascinating as you see people who have essentially set up their own museums of Americana and live life how they've chosen to live it--no matter if everyone else thinks they're a bit crazy.Once the pickers manage to buy an object, they provide an appraisal of what they think they can sell it for.  Sometimes, that's just another 20 or 30 bucks than what they paid for it and sometimes it thousands.  Sometimes, they take a chance and end up paying too much and lose on the deal.  Sure, you sometimes wonder if they are taking advantage of some of these people, but at the time there is no guarantee they will manage to sell some of the stuff for the price they think they can get and they have to clean the stuff and even restore the objects on occasion.  Plus, the people they are buying from get to be on tv and they would have had to had to agree with that in the first place.  This is ""reality tv"" clearly, and we only see part of what is really going on...Basically, if you like junk, if you like antiques, if you like old cars and motorcyles, then you might like this show.  But, its not really something you'd sit down and watch over and over again.

Meeting the people who have collected (or hoarded) this stuff for generations always is a story in itself when they reveal how they obtained certain items in the first place. Mike and Frank love to delve into American history by learning about rare pieces.It is an educational and interesting show and I bet it stirred the pot for a lot of people sitting at home to wonder what their stuff is worth. But as you can see on the show, sometimes your stuff is worth zip, especially when it can be turned over to reveal a $9.99 sticker! Assuming your junk has value could really initiate and aggravate hoarding symptoms and watching the show does not develop the skill of how to find pieces worth something since they seem to ""pick"" some of the most unlikely items.While antiques themselves are not my bag, resale and flipping is very alluring and fun to watch.

Mike and Frank, our guides through virtually infinite untapped resources of iconic antiques and mangled auto parts, have a brotherly rapport. Mike is the natural leader, charismatic but not afraid to get his hands dirty. Frank is his trustworthy and can-obsessed Sancho Panza. They are immediately likable, down-to-earth and just all around friendly.The places they visit throughout the course of the season vary immensely, and take them across the continental US, through decaying out-buildings and the homesteads of collectors, eccentrics and at least one gun-totting Southern gent. Sometimes it feels very much like the houses these men scour for odd, stylish antiques (and their rugged cousins ""mantiques"") could be contenders for the show Hoarders. Unlike that depressing program, however, the people who graciously allow their lives to be picked through by our heroes are presented as unsung salt-of-the-earth folk. Real people whose amassed wealth lingers in the objects they have spent their years storing. The stories of the objects add intrinsic value beyond the appraised monetary worth. Through Mike and Frank, the audience becomes a part of the legacy of battered farmhands and auto-part enthusiasts alike. This is the reason the show exists on the History channel. It is a piece, or rather, hundreds of scattered pieces of vintage Americana, soulful and rich. Surprises abound in overgrown yards, in dilapidated trailers. After continual viewing, American Pickers might very well lead one to consider with a more meticulous eye their own storied objects, to foster an appreciation for the life on shelved dolls or a gear for a childhood bicycle.

1331851,A6FIAB28IS79,B0038M2AUA,Samuel Chell,"[5, 8]","After no longer finding Fox news very funny, even tiring of Stewart and Colbert, and sensing that, at least since Bush, Olberman had lost much of his audacious eloquence and rhetorical thunder, I was fine with cutting loose from my cable connection and retiring to old movies.  Then I discovered ""Pawn Stars,"" which by itself caused me to reconsider.  ""American Pickers"" was a slower learning experience for me.  It didn't have a ""con artist"" (intended in the best, old carnie sense of the word) like the alternately affable and ruthlessly decisive Rick or a potential mega-media star like Chumley.  But Mike and Frank grow on you, an unlikely pair of latter-day Midwestern prospectors who not only take their quests seriously but manifest genuine feeling for each other as well as their elderly providers.  The show generates little of the interest in actual resale value as does ""Pawn Stars"" or in the before and after shots of ancient artifacts that have been expertly restored by one of Rick's many ""buddies.""  But it compensates with plenty of human interest (though try not to be initially put off by Mike's in-your-face mannerisms and amplified razor-blade voice: you soon come to respect him as a straight-up guy you'd do business with any day, and it doesn't hurt that Frank's softer, Teddy Bear personality is always on hand to counterbalance the more strident Mike).It soon becomes apparent that Rick and Mike have been prepped by the same reality TV coach--the pauses, inflections, exclamatory remarks (""The minute I saw it I knew I had to have it!"") soon stand out despite the differences in their personalities.  Both shows constantly challenge those who are so inclined to play the role of the invisible co-star(s): the camera crew that's doing the prepping, the set-ups, the ghost-stepping in the footprints of Rick's family or Frank and Mike.  When the latter pair discover the ultra-bizarre underground ""mole"" collector, and follow him into his precarious labyrinthian lair, you have to wonder how a single camera man could have tracked them, and the same when the pair split up to approach a prospective client singlehandedly so as not to ""spook"" him with a two-person full-frontal approach. Yet the number and variety of camera set-ups suggest that the pair are being shadowed by more than a one-person production team.Of the two shows, ""American Pickers"" definitely has more socially redeeming value.  Testimonies by the treasure hunters aside, the real bonanza, the ultimate ""pick,"" is pure Americana--an appreciation for America's past and the collection of weathered and withered yet diverse characters who have devoted their lives to assuring that a few concrete fossils will be preserved for future generations to appreciate (the show performs a service if it motivates young people to expand their time horizons beyond the immediate present or discourage them from limiting their speculations to Steve Jobs' announcement about the next iPod in six months).What some may find disturbing about the show is the mirror it's bound to hold up to those of us who find time slipping away considerably faster than our possessions (at times, there even seems to be an inverse relation between the two: we acquire ""things"" faster than we lose them.  ...a misguided effort to console ourselves for what we sense is being irretrievably lost?).  Mike's and Frank's ""clients,"" despite being in their '90s and literally swamped by scrap metal and ""old stuff,"" are frequently reluctant to part with an old bicycle part they may find a use for some day.The show strives mightily to overcome the sense of the elegiac and largely succeeds, but not without a continual unsettling undertone.  All of the junk, rust and dirt--convertible into cash or not--is a symbol of human mutability and our ultimately futile attempts to overcome it.  Still, you can't help but regret that these guys never had a chance to pick through Charles Foster Kane's vast menagerie before it all went into the fireplace at Xanadu and up in smoke.
