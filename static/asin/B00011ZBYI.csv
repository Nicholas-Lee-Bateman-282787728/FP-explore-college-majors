790885,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B00011ZBYI,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[8, 8]","A predictable plot, and a script and editing that could have been better are saved by the talent and enthusiasm of a terrific cast, and some fabulous music that is full of joy and life. ""The Fighting Temptations"" is also family friendly by today's standards and has a balance between the religious and secular that should provide ""something for everyone."" The only disappointment is that it had the potential of being so much better, as in the audition scene, which could have been hilarious, but lags and at times falls flat.The cast: Oscar winner Cuba Gooding Jr. has a charisma and energy that fills the screen, and is a marvelous actor. He deserved better direction and script here, but nevertheless always gives us 100% of his overflowing talent as Darrin Hill, a con man forced to face the truth of his superficial life. ""Destiny's Child"" Beyonc&eacute; Knowles, who gained a few pounds and became even more voluptuous for the role of Lilly, a single parent and lounge singer, is absolutely gorgeous, and does as well with her acting as she does as a singer. Among the many standout performances, some are memorable: Mike Epps as Lucius, Melba Moore as Bessie, Wendell Pierce as Reverend Lewis, Eddie Levert Sr. as Joseph the barber, and Rue McClanahan, Lou Myers, Angie Stone, Mickey Jones, and T-Bone.The music: My favorite numbers are ""Rain Down,"" with Angie Stone and Eddie Levert, Sr., and also with Eddie and his fellow ""O'Jays"" Walter Williams and Eric Nolan Grant, ""Love Me Like a Rock."" ""To Da River"" with T-Bone, Zane, and Montell Jordan is exceptional, being the rare combination of a rap song with a melody, and other fabulous numbers are sung throughout the film, including a sultry rendition of the Peggy Lee hit, ""Fever,"" by Beyonc&eacute;. The Blind Boys of Alabama and Melba Moore are among the many other fine performances.Weak moments don't stop this from being a very enjoyable film, and well worth its 123 minutes of one's time.",4,great cast and music highlight fun film,1119744000,"06 26, 2005",2005,1955,"['predictable', 'plot', 'script', 'editing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'are', 'saved', 'talent', 'enthusiasm', 'terrific', 'cast', 'fabulous', 'music', 'full', 'joy', 'life', 'Fighting', 'Temptations', 'also', 'family', 'friendly', 'today', 'standards', 'balance', 'religious', 'secular', 'should', 'provide', 'something', 'everyone', 'only', 'disappointment', 'had', 'potential', 'being', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'audition', 'scene', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'hilarious', 'lags', 'times', 'falls', 'flat.The', 'cast', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'charisma', 'energy', 'screen', 'marvelous', 'actor', 'deserved', 'better', 'direction', 'script', 'here', 'nevertheless', 'always', '100', '%', 'overflowing', 'talent', 'Darrin', 'Hill', 'con', 'man', 'forced', 'face', 'truth', 'superficial', 'life', 'Destiny', 'Child', 'Beyonc', 'eacute', 'Knowles', 'who', 'gained', 'few', 'pounds', 'became', 'even', 'more', 'voluptuous', 'role', 'Lilly', 'single', 'parent', 'lounge', 'singer', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'as', 'well', 'acting', 'singer', 'many', 'standout', 'performances', 'are', 'memorable', 'Mike', 'Epps', 'Lucius', 'Melba', 'Moore', 'Bessie', 'Wendell', 'Pierce', 'Reverend', 'Lewis', 'Eddie', 'Levert', 'Sr.', 'Joseph', 'barber', 'Rue', 'McClanahan', 'Lou', 'Myers', 'Angie', 'Stone', 'Mickey', 'Jones', 'T-Bone.The', 'music', 'favorite', 'numbers', 'are', 'Rain', 'Down', 'Angie', 'Stone', 'Eddie', 'Levert', 'Sr.', 'also', 'Eddie', 'fellow', ""O'Jays"", 'Walter', 'Williams', 'Eric', 'Nolan', 'Grant', 'Love', 'Me', 'Rock', 'Da', 'River', 'T-Bone', 'Zane', 'Montell', 'Jordan', 'exceptional', 'being', 'rare', 'combination', 'rap', 'song', 'melody', 'other', 'fabulous', 'numbers', 'are', 'sung', 'film', 'including', 'sultry', 'rendition', 'Peggy', 'Lee', 'hit', 'Fever', 'Beyonc', 'eacute', 'Blind', 'Boys', 'Alabama', 'Melba', 'Moore', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'fine', 'performances.Weak', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'being', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'well', '123', 'minutes', 'one', 'time']",N/A

Reluctantly, he decides to go through with it only because he was fired from his job in advertising and he needs the money.

790891,A5L5ITYHNCJYL,B00011ZBYI,"Chris Honaker ""reviewman""","[1, 1]","The movie might be a little unrealistic but it does have a strong message added with some humor.  Cuba Gooding Jr. plays Darrin Hill who grew up in a small town in Georgia along with Lilly (Beyonce Knowles) who he had a crush on since day one but Lilly keeps telling him she's waiting for Michael Jackson to come along.  Anyway, Darrin's mother was a member of the church choir and when she was outside of the church she performed in clubs to try and get a record deal.  Paulina who i think is a secetary of the church claimed that his mother was an embarrassment for the church because the music she was singing was sexually immoral.  Darrin's mother was giving a choice and that was to either to quit performing satan music at the club or leave the choir, she left the choir.  Darrin years later was found working in New York at a marketing firm.  Darrin literally lies to get want he wants.  He misrepesented himself at work and at home by pretending that he graduated from a big university which I think they said was Yale and of course he said he graduated from high school, but that wasn't true either.  Of course, Darrin's sins came back to haunt as his boss discovered these misrepresentations and Darrin was unemployed.  To make matters worse, Darrin was in financial debt up to his ears and he constantly used up the limit of how much he could spent on his credit cards.  The good news is (well kind of good) Darrin's aunt passed away and so he returns to his hometown to see the funeral which was the first time he had seen or talked to her in 20 years.  Darrin discovered that in his aunt's will he is asked to take over the church choir and lead them into the gospel explosion, if he is successful he will be inherited 150,000.  The problem is, darrin doesn't know jack about music directing, he doesn't know an upbeat from a downbeat.  However, Darrin once again misrepresents himself just so he can get his hands on that money by claiming he has helped out musicians like P. Diddy and Dr. Dre.  He has Steve Harvey's character, who is a liquor-swigging disc jockey to help promote the choir and get people to try out.  Unforunately, noone made the cut.  However, as Darrin is still trying to persuade Lilly to join he happens to meet a barbershop trio (O'Jays) singing and was able to get them to join the group and in the next coming weeks Darrin put together the oddest choir ever assembled but when they co-existed, they were awesome.  Paulina of course tries desperately to break up the choir by not mentioning the deadline to when the choir was to sign up and pay the fees to get into the contest and always revealing the dirty sins of the group especially Lilly who is single with a son.  Darrin did get Lilly to join along with ex-convicts, hillbilly pianist who happens to be a drunkard, rappers, blind boys, etc.  Everything was going great until Paulina discovered about Darrin's new york job and that his boss would be willing to hire him back which really concerns the choir and puts Darrin in a morality check.  Darrin claims that hey why not lie about all of this when it was the church that tore his family apart and he does go back to new york to promote his liquor product, but as he was promoting it the words of his aunt starting sinking in that he doesn't need to lie about who he is and decides he would rather direct the choir.  That task wasn't easy as to deal with the mean Paulina and try to get the rev and lilly back in the group.  Against all odds, Darrin did get to lead the choir into the explosion and they ended up winning the contest.  Darrin ended up keeping his promise and successfully follow his aunt's wishes and ends up going back to his old church and lead the choir every sunday.  Yes, he and Lilly were together and had a their own child. The movie had a very interesting cast and tons of humor.  From drinking to Mike Epps pimp lifestyle that he has portrayed in all his movies, to seeing old folks brawling in the church this is definatly a touching but still funny flick.

At first I thought I was going to be seeing some dry gospel movie with a deep spiritual message and a lot of tear jerky gospel singing.  Although it did have a lot of gospel singing, it was very upbeat.  The soundtrack is one of the best I've heard since The Wiz (and that was out in the 70's).  I listened to it on their web site and I'm definately going to buy it.  The movie did teach a good lesson about lying and true happiness, and at the same time, it was very funny and entertaining.

I found it so cliched that she was a single parent raising a child in the South by herself, would it have hurt the story line for her to have a husband beside her.  Yes, the film managed to deliver without nudity or profanity but I don't feel that the viewer should be grateful for this fact, after all it is a gospel film.  Let's fact it without Beyonce this film would go straight to video without hitting the movie theaters.  A film like this, should have finished with a cataclysmic finale.

His youth was spent on the road accompanying his mother (Faith Evans) who was ostracized from their hometown church. It was found out one Sunday that Darrin's mom was singing R&B; with suggestive lyrics. The strict rules of the church were enforced by Paulina who as the antagonist is successful in ridding of Darrin's mom.Forward many years later, Darrin receives notice of his Aunt's passing. He makes the trek back to his hometown with big town attitude and swagger. He is revered as a hero, but in fact is a failure in sheep's clothing. His trip comes with an opportunity to cash (and save himself from debt) in on his Aunt's will. He is given authority to reconstruct the choir and enter them into a contest. With green on his mind, Darrin seeks out his quest to bring himself out of the red. He finds out more about himself, his family, and his hometown.Though structurally not sound, the Fighting Temptations does provide funny moments with touching ones as well. Both Gooding and Beyonce Knowles play believable characters with substance. Mike Epps, Steve Harvey, Melba Moore, and Angie Stone round out a nice supporting cast.Backed up with a joyous and emotional soundtrack, The Fighting Temptations is a good movie centered on the honesty (or dishonesty) of Darrin Hill and the hypocrisy of a small town church.

But the music is great, this full new generation of Gospel singing that finds its reviving inspiration in hip hop, rock, and all kinds of other new developments, particularly the black musicians of the USA, urban or not, that want to take real life as their inspiration, real life of the younger generations and dedicate their vision to some religious dream and hope.That's probably what this film is best about: it really puts religion back in its place in society and that place is to procure joy and even happiness to people and not the sour ethics of an old fake widow who hides her having been abandoned by her husband behind the front cover of the Bible. This film is probably optimistic about the depth of this religious feeling among the younger generations, but it is not entirely false: these younger generations are looking for some spirituality, even in the most secular countries who, like the secular sectarian France, forbid religious discourse and culture in their schools and public institutions, including the kipa or skullcap for the Jews, the head scarf for Moslem women, and only tolerate religious pins if they are smaller than one inch.Here in this film they work a revival of a southern Baptist church choir that manages to find the real force of joy and gaiety in being together with others and share some communion with a divine dimension in this life. Not the communion of the commandments but the communion of the heart and empathy, soul and mind.The film though, as for the plot and tempo, is slightly too slow at times, too nonchalant.

Very soon the choir has new members which soon include three hysterically funny convicts and a beautiful lounge singer with an attitude as they strive achieve Darrin's deceased Grandmother's dream of making it big on the gospel circuit, especially the Gospel Explosion Competition in Atlanta.However the salt in the sugar is that Darrin's not doing it out of the goodness of his heart, he's hard hearted city boy after all, he in it for the money because there's a $150,000 legacy up for grabs and he has his eye on the main chance.However Darrin doesn't expect to fall in love with the lounge singer, the warmth of Southern Life and the food which to his disgust he can't get when he returns to the city and nor does he expect to grow fond of the misfits he has cobbled together in a bid to claim his inheritance.Be prepared for gentle laughs throughout the movie, a few loud chuckles over some of the ""ruder"" aspects of the film and toe tap your way through a great gospel soundtrack that had me almost heading for church to join in and I'm of the Hindu persuasion!The cast are crackingly good fun in this feel good movie, with Beyonc&eacute; Knowles proving she can act as well as sing, and you get some fun and energetic performances from the likes of T-Bone, (I love his hair in this movie!) LaTanya Richardson and the wonderful Melba Moore.Look out also for Golden Girl Rue McClanahan giving it her all, and sit back and enjoy this easy to watch movie that is enchanting as it is naughty in places.",5,"A rare film in the 21st Century, it's a feel good move guys!",1116720000,"05 22, 2005",2005,2327,"['Not', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'exciting', 'plot', 'who', 'earth', 'cares', 'age', 'special', 'effects', 'pretensions', 'such', 'actors/actresses', 'telling', 'press', 'friends', 'OH', 'WELL', 'IT', 'METHOD', 'ACTING', 'YOU', 'KNOW', 'MAKES', 'IT', 'SO', 'REAL', 'nice', 'watch', 'movie', 'fun', 'pleasing', 'eye.You', 'could', 'call', 'movie', 'poor', 'man', 'Sister', 'Act', 'certainly', 'feel', 'even', ""n't"", 'detract', 'charm', 'energy', 'very', 'rated', 'movie', 'found', 'enjoying', 'plot', ""n't"", 'rocket', 'science', 'thank', 'God', 'New', 'York', 'advertising', 'executive', 'Darrin', 'Hill', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'small', 'Southern', 'Town', 'reading', 'Grandmother', 'will', 'getting', 'involved', 'gospel', 'choir', 'could', ""n't"", 'sing', 'way', 'paper', 'bag', 'Very', 'soon', 'choir', 'new', 'members', 'soon', 'include', 'three', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'convicts', 'beautiful', 'lounge', 'singer', 'attitude', 'strive', 'achieve', 'Darrin', 'deceased', 'Grandmother', 'dream', 'making', 'big', 'gospel', 'circuit', 'especially', 'Gospel', 'Explosion', 'Competition', 'Atlanta.However', 'salt', 'sugar', 'Darrin', 'not', 'doing', 'goodness', 'heart', 'hard', 'hearted', 'city', 'boy', 'money', '150,000', 'legacy', 'up', 'grabs', 'eye', 'main', 'chance.However', 'Darrin', ""n't"", 'expect', 'fall', 'love', 'lounge', 'singer', 'warmth', 'Southern', 'Life', 'food', 'disgust', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'when', 'city', 'expect', 'grow', 'fond', 'misfits', 'cobbled', 'together', 'bid', 'claim', 'inheritance.Be', 'prepared', 'gentle', 'laughs', 'movie', 'few', 'loud', 'chuckles', 'ruder', 'aspects', 'film', 'toe', 'tap', 'way', 'great', 'gospel', 'soundtrack', 'had', 'almost', 'heading', 'church', 'join', ""'m"", 'Hindu', 'persuasion', 'cast', 'are', 'crackingly', 'good', 'fun', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'Beyonc', 'eacute', 'Knowles', 'proving', 'can', 'act', 'as', 'well', 'sing', 'get', 'fun', 'energetic', 'performances', 'likes', 'T-Bone', 'love', 'hair', 'movie', 'LaTanya', 'Richardson', 'wonderful', 'Melba', 'Moore.Look', 'out', 'also', 'Golden', 'Girl', 'Rue', 'McClanahan', 'giving', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'easy', 'watch', 'movie', 'enchanting', 'naughty', 'places']",N/A

Garrard ""the G-man""","[3, 6]","If not for the contemporary setting, fashion, and music, one might think &quot;The Fighting Temptations&quot; was made in the early 40's. The story line seems as if it were lifted from one of those old &quot;let's-put-on-a-show-to-save-the-town&quot; musicals starring Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney.And the ethnic, regional, gender, and corporate stereotypes are so thick; it's a wonder the movie was picketed by the N.A.A.C.P., The League for the Defamation of Southerners, feminists, or church folk.Speaking of the church scenes (of which these comprise three-fifths of the film), some things transpire that are too outrageous to believe: the &quot;shouting&quot; and church services are too over the top; a young couple passionately tongue each other in the choir stand and in the congregational pews; and one character boozes it up and carries a gun while playing the organ, just to name a few.Thank God, the film boasts a great soundtrack. It can't lose with performances from the likes of Ann Nesby, Melba Moore, Rev. Shirley Caesar, The O'Jays, Beyonce, Angie Stone, Montel Jordan, and rapper T-Bone who is showcased prominently in one of the film's strongest songs.As far as the acting is concerned, the performers do the best with what is given them in the rather routine script. A chief standout is Steve Harvey's portrayal of a radio announcer that &quot;tells it like it is&quot; while puffing on a cigarette. He's sort of like the movie's &quot;Greek chorus&quot;, providing insight and humor.It's also refreshing to see Rue McClanahan as one of the choir members. The former &quot;Golden Girl&quot; appears to be having a ball with the big production numbers and holds her own with the more seasoned singers.As the closing credits roll, the viewer is reminded how gifted a dancer and athlete Cuba Gooding, Jr. really is! He cavorts, contorts, flips, and flies, never missing a beat.Had Hollywood not beckoned, the Oscar winner's name would, without a doubt, be frequently seen on a Broadway marquee.The film, though entertaining for most of its 123-minute running time, could've easily been produced for television or home video.

The music was outstanding- Beyonce Knowles, The Blind Boys of Alabama, Shirley Caesar, and the Rapper T-Bone gave outstanding performances.But as a pastor, give me a break. The stereotyping was awful.  Where did they find such a weak-kneed pastor who could not stand up to female church bully especially in a black church?  Since when does one find someone being slain in the Spirit in a Baptist church?  Just how long are those church by-laws anyway?  It seems that even the minutest detail of church life is regulated by these omnipresent by-laws.  The overly enthusiastic church service with people dancing in the aisles seemed like it was borrowed from The Blues Brothers movie.  Oh by the way, since when can a ministry position in the church (choir director) be passed on through a private will to someone who does not attend?  And since when are Christians so selective who can come into the church?

""Sister Act"" & ""Gospel""), it actually turns out to be more like the gospel version of ""Catch Me If You Can"" ... sort of. Okay, well at least it tries to be different ... sort of.

After watching the previews, I was looking forward to this movie since I thought that it was going to be highly entertaining. The truth is that it has some entertaining value, but that's about it, there is not much else.Darrin Hill (Cuba Gooding Jr.) is climbing the corporate ladder in an advertising agency in New York years after his mother, Mary Ann, is forced to leave the Church's Choir in their hometown when she had to choose between the choir and singing ""profane"" R&B; as a recording artist.Things are beginning to look good for Darrin in the Big Apple until he gets the boot for lying about his education on his job application. At this point, he finds out that his Aunt Sally passed away and when he goes back to Monte Carlo, GA for the funeral, he receives the shocking news that she left him $150,000 on the condition that he directs the Church's Choir and gets it accepted into the Annual Gospel Explosion. With creditors pressing and out of a job, Darrin has no choice but to embark in this enterprise, which is harder than he realized.I have always enjoyed the performances of Cuba Gooding Jr., but in this case I think he does not deliver at the level at which he usually does. The movie is ""stolen"" away by Beyonce Knowles and her singing. She plays a single mother (Lilly) who was Darrin's childhood sweetheart. As I stated earlier, the movie has its entertaining moments, but at some points it gets boring and senseless. The director, Jonathan Lynn, could have cut thirty minutes of scenes without losing any real value or substance. I like Gospel music, but it is not my favorite genre, so I acknowledge that if you really love this type of music you will probably enjoy the movie a lot more than I did.",3,Not as good as expected,1078012800,"02 29, 2004",2004,1770,"['musical', 'comedy', 'short', 'mark', 'watching', 'previews', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'truth', 'entertaining', 'value', 'not', 'much', 'else.Darrin', 'Hill', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'climbing', 'corporate', 'ladder', 'advertising', 'agency', 'New', 'York', 'years', 'mother', 'Mary', 'Ann', 'forced', 'leave', 'Church', 'Choir', 'hometown', 'when', 'had', 'choose', 'choir', 'singing', 'profane', 'R', 'B', 'recording', 'artist.Things', 'are', 'beginning', 'look', 'good', 'Darrin', 'Big', 'Apple', 'boot', 'lying', 'education', 'job', 'application', 'point', 'out', 'Aunt', 'Sally', 'passed', 'away', 'when', 'back', 'Monte', 'Carlo', 'GA', 'funeral', 'shocking', 'news', 'left', '150,000', 'condition', 'Church', 'Choir', 'accepted', 'Annual', 'Gospel', 'Explosion', 'creditors', 'pressing', 'job', 'Darrin', 'choice', 'embark', 'enterprise', 'harder', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'performances', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'case', 'think', 'not', 'deliver', 'level', 'usually', 'movie', 'stolen', 'away', 'Beyonce', 'Knowles', 'singing', 'single', 'mother', 'Lilly', 'who', 'was', 'Darrin', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'stated', 'earlier', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'moments', 'points', 'boring', 'senseless', 'director', 'Jonathan', 'Lynn', 'could', 'have', 'cut', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'scenes', 'losing', 'real', 'value', 'substance', 'Gospel', 'music', 'not', 'favorite', 'genre', 'acknowledge', 'really', 'love', 'type', 'music', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'did']",N/A
