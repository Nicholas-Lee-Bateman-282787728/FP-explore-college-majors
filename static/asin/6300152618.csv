This forgotten Christmas special features the voices of Tommy Smothers and Barbara Feldon as two bears in a mythical bear world, and it's Tommy's character who longs to find out about this so-called ""Christmas"" that he heard about once. The problem is all bears fall into hibernation in this bear world, and can never really find out what this strange ""Christmas"" is.Not a bad seasonal special from the early seventies that deserves to find additional life on DVD.

Bear, get it?) is about to go into hibernation for the winter with his fellow bears, including his ladyfriend, Pattie Bear (voiced by Barbara Feldon).  But for years Ted has heard about something called Christmas, which in the past, he's attempted to find but always falls asleep.  Not this year.  Ted is determined once and for all to find out what Christmas exactly is, and nothing or no one is going to stop him.I watched this TV Christmas special the night it premiered on NBC forty years ago this month, and I have never forgotten it.  As a child you can't appreciate the true message behind it like you can as an adult.  Now that I am a half century older, and I've seen Charlie Brown and the gang a thousand times, I see the real beauty behind Ted E. Bear's frantic quest to find out what this thing called Christmas is all about.Like so many, I too am disappointed that no one has seen fit to release this classic on DVD.  However, I am thankful to Amazon for offering this as a streaming video, which I saw earlier this evening.  By the way, there is another Christmas program that follows if you stick around to watch it.  I don't know what exactly it is, but it appears to be some kind of pilot for Ted E. Bear and his further adventures, which perhaps the producers were hoping to land more deals for.  It's about 25 minutes in length, and features drawings and narration to two additional stories involving Thanksgiving and &#34;How Christmas Came to Monster Mountain,&#34; the latter which eventually was turned into a 1983 TV special.It's nice to know I am not the only one who holds Ted E.
