It is extremely hard to believe that the captivating Seasons 1-4 belong to the same tv series/franchise as Season 6. So Bill Comptom (aka Billith) is now a superhuman mini-god and vampire savior who can walk in the daylight and although he professes to despise Sookie, but then he quickly allows Warlow (a sexy-macho vampire/faeri hybrid?????) to save her from an untimely death at the hands of her father? And stupid sex-starved Sookie is even more stupider, if such a term/phrase exists in the English language. Meanwhile, Sam Merlott the shifter is still running around half-naked as usual and having sex with the first random female that crosses his path? Lafayette is still seeing ghosts, visions, and apparitions in his drug-warped mind. Tara is still over-acting her scenes and is even more annoying than usual.

While I can say that this show has changed a lot from season 1 to season 6, it has been a natural progression and one that I don't feel was too forced. That being said, I didn't find season 6 as engaging or enthralling as the previous 5 seasons, which is sad because this season puts all of the main characters in the most danger yet. The show is still filled with gore, tons of nudity and some really cool action scenes and one liners that this show has become so popular for. Yet I found myself not being as emotionally invested in these characters as I normally am.Season 6 brings back Anna Camp (Pitch Perfect) as Steve Newlin's estranged wife Sarah, and we have some new characters like Ben Flynn played by Robert Kazinsky (Pacific Rim) and  Nicole Wright played by the beautiful Jurnee Smollett-Bell (Friday Night Lights). But for me I thought Arliss Howard (Wilder Napalm) as Truman Burrell and Rutger Hauer (Bladerunner) as fairy king Niall Brigant were the stand out new additions to the show. As per usual, this is a character driven series but this season all bets are off for who lives and who dies. With tainted True Blood about to hit shelves, most of the main vampires locked up by Governor Burell, Sookie is after Warlow before he gets her, Jason is as confused as ever, and Bill has no idea who he is or what powers he has, or for how long he'll have them.While some characters are dramatically down played from previous seasons (I feel like Sookie and Alcide had the least amount of screen time this season, until the last two episodes) we see a lot of Eric and Pam and Jessica and these new characters which helped make this season feel a bit more fresh, and at the same time a bit distant and stale when compared to previous seasons. Ultimately I think anyone who is a True Blood fan will enjoy season 6, it has some big moments, fills in some blanks from previous season loose ends, and delivers a lot of the things we've come to love from this show. Granted this is probably the weakest season since season 2, I still enjoyed it as much as I ever do. There were some very cool throw-away scenes in the last two episodes that were very reminiscent of season 1 and had a very light hearted feeling to it. And the last 2 episodes were the best of the season. Of course it ends with a cliff hanger to segue nicely into season 7. True Blood isn't for everyone, but for anyone who has been watching this show for the last 5 seasons, you'll be in for some great treats in season 6.",4,True Blood Season 6,1376870400,"08 19, 2013",2013,3377,"['True', 'Blood', 'Season', '6', 'streets', 'June', '3rd', '2014', '*Five', 'commentaries', 'cast', 'crew', 'including', 'executive', 'producer', 'Brian', 'Buckner', 'Stephen', 'Moyer', 'Carrie', 'Preston', 'Amelia', 'Rose', 'Blaire', 'more', 'Episodes', 'Featurettes', 'Learn', 'backstories', 'episode', 'revealing', 'interviews', 'show', 'ten', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurettes', '*Vamp', 'Camp', 'Files', 'Get', 'inside', 'look', 'secret', 'trove', 'documents', 'detailing', 'effort', 'eradicate', 'vampires', 'institution', 'known', 'Vamp', 'Camp', '*True', 'Blood', 'Lines', 'Uncover', 'secrets', 'character', 'relationships', 'past', 'present', 'engaging', 'fully', 'interactive', 'season', 'guide', 'information', 'archive', '*Episode', 'Previews', 'RecapsCreator', 'show', 'not', 'books', ""'re"", 'based', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'left', 'True', 'Blood', 'helm', 'Cinemax', 'Banshee', 'great', 'show', 'fifth', 'season', 'worried', 'lot', 'fans', 'can', 'say', 'show', 'changed', 'lot', 'season', '1', 'season', '6', 'been', 'natural', 'progression', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'too', 'forced', 'being', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'season', '6', 'engaging', 'enthralling', 'previous', '5', 'seasons', 'sad', 'season', 'main', 'characters', 'most', 'danger', 'yet', 'show', 'still', 'filled', 'gore', 'tons', 'nudity', 'really', 'cool', 'action', 'scenes', 'one', 'liners', 'show', 'become', 'so', 'popular', 'found', 'not', 'being', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'characters', 'normally', 'am.Season', '6', 'brings', 'back', 'Anna', 'Camp', 'Pitch', 'Perfect', 'Steve', 'Newlin', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Sarah', 'have', 'new', 'characters', 'Ben', 'Flynn', 'played', 'Robert', 'Kazinsky', 'Pacific', 'Rim', 'Nicole', 'Wright', 'played', 'beautiful', 'Jurnee', 'Smollett-Bell', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'thought', 'Arliss', 'Howard', 'Wilder', 'Napalm', 'Truman', 'Burrell', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'Bladerunner', 'fairy', 'king', 'Niall', 'Brigant', 'were', 'stand', 'out', 'new', 'additions', 'show', 'usual', 'character', 'driven', 'series', 'season', 'bets', 'are', 'who', 'who', 'tainted', 'True', 'Blood', 'hit', 'shelves', 'most', 'main', 'vampires', 'locked', 'up', 'Governor', 'Burell', 'Sookie', 'Warlow', 'Jason', 'as', 'confused', 'ever', 'Bill', 'idea', 'who', 'what', 'powers', 'how', 'long', ""'ll"", 'have', 'characters', 'are', 'dramatically', 'down', 'played', 'previous', 'seasons', 'feel', 'Sookie', 'Alcide', 'had', 'least', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'season', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'see', 'lot', 'Eric', 'Pam', 'Jessica', 'new', 'characters', 'helped', 'make', 'season', 'feel', 'bit', 'more', 'fresh', 'same', 'time', 'bit', 'distant', 'stale', 'when', 'compared', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Ultimately', 'think', 'anyone', 'who', 'True', 'Blood', 'fan', 'will', 'enjoy', 'season', '6', 'big', 'moments', 'fills', 'blanks', 'previous', 'season', 'loose', 'ends', 'lot', 'things', ""'ve"", 'come', 'love', 'show', 'Granted', 'probably', 'weakest', 'season', 'season', '2', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'as', 'much', 'ever', 'do', 'were', 'very', 'cool', 'throw-away', 'scenes', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'were', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'season', '1', 'had', 'very', 'light', 'hearted', 'feeling', 'last', '2', 'episodes', 'were', 'best', 'season', 'course', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'segue', 'nicely', 'season', '7', 'True', 'Blood', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'anyone', 'who', 'been', 'watching', 'show', 'last', '5', 'seasons', ""'ll"", 'be', 'great', 'treats', 'season', '6']",N/A

1667371,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B00EIL7E9C,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[33, 52]","One of the most appealing things about the first few seasons of TRUE BLOOD was not just how addictive it was, or how appealing the characters were, but is that the first few seasons seemed to have focus. There weren't twelve different storylines that were trying to eclipse each other; they all seemed to come together in the end. But starting really with Season Four, it started to run a little off the rails, but that was excusable to an extent because the show still worked well. But in Season Five, it started to really wander all over the place and all the character work that had come before became an afterthought in attempts to propel the weirdness of the goings-on in Bon Temps into the stratosphere, combining seven or eight different plots that seemed to go almost nowhere, and once it got to the finale, nothing really coalesced.Season Six is almost a perfect distillation of the bad parts of this show and how bad it can get.So Bill's a god after drinking the blood of Lilith; Sookie learns who sold her out to Warlow, the vampire that is coming to make her his bride for all of eternity; Sam gets involved with ANOTHER moronic subplot that is so perfunctory that it's hard to believe that it took the writers more than ten minutes to put it together; Tara is still lame; Eric and Pam are still cool; Jessica is still sexy but scared; Jason is still trying to be the hero; Lafayette is still rocking the mystical mojo; humans are still trying new things to kill all the vampires. It's pretty much the status quo.However, the worst treated characters in the series are the Bellefleurs, and I don't just mean that in terms of plot. There are so many unnecessary moments of suffering for that family that just don't make sense, and the loss of who is my favorite character of the show was just so poorly executed that it just baffles me. I don't want to include who it is because I'd like to keep this spoiler-free.Then there's the stupidity of the Sam/Alcide feud. WHY IS THIS NECESSARY? Is it just more chest-thumping to prove how alpha-male these guys can get? Because it certainly doesn't do anything for their characters.And then there's the very worst thing: the reduction of Sookie, a strong, independent woman to nothing more than a self-admitted ""danger whore"". The show so blatantly exploits her Anna Paquin for her faux-innocent sexiness so that they can extract at least one nude sex scene for this season, despite how debasing it is to her character, because this show apparently NEEDS Sookie having sex.

In either case, I'm done. My long relationship with this series (both books and show) ended with a whimper rather than a bang. The end started off simply enough. One night I didn't make sure to sit down and watch an episode. It took me more than a week to watch it On Demand, and I couldn't see the subsequent episode before I had finished the previous one, now could I? It just became easier and easier to put off watching the show and finally I just asked myself why I was bothering. Obviously, I wasn't invested in the show anymore. I cannot point to one, single factor which caused the rift. I can, however, say with some certainty that I no longer felt connected to the characters and I felt as if they were becoming strangers that I didn't particularly like and in whose fate I wasn't particularly interested in anyway. Thus began the weaning process. It was painless, rather like a completely amicable divorce. Bloodless, lacking passion or anger. I was simply done. This show is like an ex-lover.

Now I'm not saying season 6 is all bad or even terrible.  It's still True Blood so it's still entertaining.  In some ways, I even thought it was an improvement over the disappointing season 5.  The problem however seems to be two-fold:1) This season lacked the feel of a ""real"" True Blood season.  It almost felt like a ""side season"" or something not quite a part of the actual series but still related (sort of like Battlestar Gallactica one-offs like ""The Plan"" and ""Blood and Chrome"").  It just felt sort of empty and insignificant with no big threat or real enemy to fight.  The big-bad this season looked like it was going to be Warlow.  In the end however Warlow just came across as a chump, died like a chump and never really added much of anything to the story arch except for giving Sookie something and some ONE to do.  The governor-another possible central threat likewise seemed unimportant and added nothing to the bigger picture.  And what about Billith?  Sookie was right on the nose when she said, ""you're not a god Bill, you're just an a** hole.""  So really, out of three possible threats-there wasn't really much of any threat or any kind of real substance to keep the viewer interested.2) This season was all over the place and I mean REALLY all over the place.  Many of the characters we know and love seemed to do completely irrational things or they just became more and more unlikeable as the season went on.  Eric was particularly nasty in the beginning, Bill was pretty much a dirt bag throughout even when he wasn't being Billith and even Alcide-who seems like one of the most morally grounded characters on the show became more and more unlikeable by the time the season ended.  Also-the story seemed to change on a whim without any true direction as to where they were taking it.  For those of you who watched this season-look back and try to describe it.  You can pretty sum it all up in a sentence or two.  ""So yeah, the government decides to capture vampires to study and torture them then there's this Warlow guy who may or may not be a bad guy that Sookie jumps all over even though she's been giving Alcide the cold shoulder for years, oh and Bill is a god-somehow that factors into things, though I don't really see how....""Don't get me wrong.

This season though I found myself not that engaged with the story-line. Last season ended with a loud bang, with Bill gaining some scary powers and Eric, Sookie and the rest of the band running away from the compound. Here we see how the story continues and the series quickly jumps into topics that have to do with Warlow, Sookie's past and a powerful anti-vampire group.The premise of the story is not bad, but the first half of the season the execution is lacking. It almost feels as if the writers did not really know which direction to take this series in. Finally, in the second half of the season, the story picks up and the end is much better than the beginning. Overall though, it is clearly the weakest season so far and it has shown in the drop in ratings.Sadly, this was probably one of the contributing factors for HBO to decide that there will only be one more season of this show. I truly hope that the last season is better than this one and we get the ending that the series deserves. It would also be good if they go back to 12 episodes, since 10 feels a little short.

1667408,A3MHGA6BJJ7P27,B00EIL7E9C,"W. T. Hoffman ""artist and musician""","[9, 15]","TRUE BLOOD has been my favorite show on TV since its inception. Each year, Alan Ball envisioned another one of Charlaine Harris's books, with excellent results. Season 5 however stopped following the books. Instead, last year initiated characters and plot lines, which season 6 resolves. First of all there's Warlow, a powerful, malicious vampire who killed Sookie's parents, and has a claim on her life. The last episode of season 5 created the character of ""Billith"", an amalgamation of the vampire goddess Lilith, and Bill retooled as a religious fundamentalist. Along with Warlow, the other primary antagonist for this season is the vampire hating governor of Louisiana, Truman Burrell. This season introduced some new characters. Fans of the books, will be pleased to learn that the fairy prince Niall, perfectly portrayed by Rutger Hauer (Blade Runner), has escaped from a parallel dimension to aid his grandchildren Sookie and Jason, in their fight against Warlow. While walking to work, Sookie meets Ben, a handsome stranger she develops feelings for. The other storylines include the Billith-Jessica arc, as Bill tries to understand his new godlike powers, and how he is to prevent his vision of the vampire cast members from meeting the sun. Another arc is Eric-Pam-Tara-Nora, all on the run from the genocidal war that Governor Burrell is waging against all vampires. The Alcide-Sam-Emma-Nicole arc revolves around the fallout from Luna's death, Emma's fate, Alcide's role as Pack Master, and the human rights worker Nicole, who quickly replaces Luna, as Sam's new special someone. Last of all, we have the Bellefleur axis (Terry, Arlene, Sheriff Andy and his fairy daughters). Terry still feels guilty from killing his Marine Sargent last season, while Andy's four fairy hybrid daughters create situations as they grow up ""overnight"". Finally, lets call Governor Burrell, his girlfriend Sara Newlin, and his daughter Willa, another axis. If all that sounds like a confusing mess, it is.The basic problem with this many story arcs, and character clusters, is how to keep them linked together, however tenuously. Throughout most of the season, you have Sookie, Ben, Niall and Jason exploring the Warlow dilemma, the vampires fighting Governor Burrell in and around the vampire concentration camp, Alcide and the werewolf pack chasing after Sam, Emma and Nicole, and the Bellefleurs worrying about Terry's insanity, and Andy's half fairy daughters. At best you have cohesion during the first and last episodes. Alan Ball's departure from the show, and the trouble finding a suitable replacement, may be partly to blame for the disjointed vibe. This year was said to portray the theme that evil corrupts, embodied by Bill's megalomania caused by wielding Lilith's powers, Alcide's new role as packmaster of the werewolves, and the Governor's power over the world's vampires, and their True Blood supply. However, which year DIDN'T portray the corruption of power? (Marnie, Salome, the Newlins, etc.) My major complaint, was the lack of interaction Sookie had with most the cast, especially Sam, Eric and Tara. Others have had problems with all the strange creatures, like the vampire-god hybrids, fairy-human hybrids, vampire-fairy hybrids, shifter-human hybrids, and shifter-werewolf hybrids. (Yes, these are all in the show this year.) For a show that takes itself so seriously, its become pretty wacky. Of course, the number of episodes was limited to ten, due to Anna Paquin's pregnancy. The tenth episode set up season seven, promising vampire-zombie hybrids, and a symbiotic allegiance between vampires and the human citizens of Bon Temps. Waiting between seasons doesn't suck like it used to.  Let's just hope we don't end up waxing nostalgic for the ""good ole days"" of Terry's fire monster.",4,What Ever Happened to Billith Warlow?,1377129600,"08 22, 2013",2013,3806,"['TRUE', 'BLOOD', 'been', 'favorite', 'show', 'TV', 'inception', 'year', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'envisioned', 'one', 'Charlaine', 'Harris', 'books', 'excellent', 'results', 'Season', '5', 'however', 'stopped', 'following', 'books', 'Instead', 'last', 'year', 'initiated', 'characters', 'plot', 'lines', 'season', '6', 'resolves', 'First', 'Warlow', 'powerful', 'malicious', 'vampire', 'who', 'killed', 'Sookie', 'parents', 'claim', 'life', 'last', 'episode', 'season', '5', 'created', 'character', 'Billith', 'amalgamation', 'vampire', 'goddess', 'Lilith', 'Bill', 'retooled', 'religious', 'fundamentalist', 'Warlow', 'other', 'primary', 'antagonist', 'season', 'vampire', 'hating', 'governor', 'Louisiana', 'Truman', 'Burrell', 'season', 'introduced', 'new', 'characters', 'Fans', 'books', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'learn', 'fairy', 'prince', 'Niall', 'perfectly', 'portrayed', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'escaped', 'parallel', 'dimension', 'aid', 'grandchildren', 'Sookie', 'Jason', 'fight', 'Warlow', 'walking', 'work', 'Sookie', 'Ben', 'handsome', 'stranger', 'feelings', 'other', 'storylines', 'include', 'Billith-Jessica', 'arc', 'Bill', 'understand', 'new', 'godlike', 'powers', 'how', 'prevent', 'vision', 'vampire', 'cast', 'members', 'meeting', 'sun', 'arc', 'Eric-Pam-Tara-Nora', 'run', 'genocidal', 'war', 'Governor', 'Burrell', 'waging', 'vampires', 'Alcide-Sam-Emma-Nicole', 'arc', 'fallout', 'Luna', 'death', 'Emma', 'fate', 'Alcide', 'role', 'Pack', 'Master', 'human', 'rights', 'worker', 'Nicole', 'who', 'quickly', 'Luna', 'Sam', 'new', 'special', 'someone', 'Last', 'have', 'Bellefleur', 'axis', 'Terry', 'Arlene', 'Sheriff', 'Andy', 'fairy', 'daughters', 'Terry', 'still', 'guilty', 'killing', 'Marine', 'Sargent', 'last', 'season', 'Andy', 'four', 'fairy', 'hybrid', 'daughters', 'create', 'situations', 'grow', 'up', 'overnight', 'Finally', 'call', 'Governor', 'Burrell', 'girlfriend', 'Sara', 'Newlin', 'daughter', 'Willa', 'axis', 'confusing', 'mess', 'is.The', 'basic', 'problem', 'many', 'story', 'arcs', 'character', 'clusters', 'how', 'keep', 'linked', 'together', 'however', 'tenuously', 'most', 'season', 'have', 'Sookie', 'Ben', 'Niall', 'Jason', 'exploring', 'Warlow', 'dilemma', 'vampires', 'fighting', 'Governor', 'Burrell', 'vampire', 'concentration', 'camp', 'Alcide', 'werewolf', 'pack', 'chasing', 'Sam', 'Emma', 'Nicole', 'Bellefleurs', 'worrying', 'Terry', 'insanity', 'Andy', 'half', 'fairy', 'daughters', 'best', 'have', 'cohesion', 'first', 'last', 'episodes', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'departure', 'show', 'trouble', 'finding', 'suitable', 'replacement', 'may', 'be', 'partly', 'blame', 'disjointed', 'vibe', 'year', 'was', 'said', 'portray', 'theme', 'corrupts', 'embodied', 'Bill', 'megalomania', 'caused', 'wielding', 'Lilith', 'powers', 'Alcide', 'new', 'role', 'packmaster', 'werewolves', 'Governor', 'power', 'world', 'vampires', 'True', 'Blood', 'supply', 'However', 'year', 'DID', ""N'T"", 'portray', 'corruption', 'power', 'Marnie', 'Salome', 'Newlins', 'etc', 'major', 'complaint', 'was', 'lack', 'interaction', 'Sookie', 'had', 'most', 'cast', 'especially', 'Sam', 'Eric', 'Tara', 'Others', 'have', 'had', 'problems', 'strange', 'creatures', 'vampire-god', 'hybrids', 'fairy-human', 'hybrids', 'vampire-fairy', 'hybrids', 'shifter-human', 'hybrids', 'shifter-werewolf', 'hybrids', 'Yes', 'are', 'show', 'year', 'show', 'so', 'seriously', 'become', 'pretty', 'wacky', 'course', 'number', 'episodes', 'was', 'limited', 'ten', 'due', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'pregnancy', 'tenth', 'episode', 'set', 'up', 'season', 'seven', 'promising', 'vampire-zombie', 'hybrids', 'symbiotic', 'allegiance', 'vampires', 'human', 'citizens', 'Bon', 'Temps', 'Waiting', 'seasons', ""n't"", 'suck', 'used', 'Let', 'just', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'waxing', 'nostalgic', 'good', 'ole', 'days', 'Terry', 'fire', 'monster']",N/A
