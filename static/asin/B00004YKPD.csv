Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[4, 6]","Like Bardock: The Father of Goku, The History of Trunks attempts to give a glimpse to the past of one of DBZ's characters, that being Future Trunks. Also like Bardock this isn't exactly a movie release but a special that originally aired on Japanese TV, yet it has all of the same similarities as the movies, that being it's relative shortness and its self-contained adventure.In this, we see the start of the attack of the androids and learn the true history of what happened to the Z warriors. Left behind from the initial destruction is Gohan and Trunks, and Trunks has yet to achieve the status of Super Saiyan. Living in a destroyed world, Gohan and Trunks spend a lot of time waiting for the news to reveal the location of the androids, and when not doing that they are training to get stronger. All of it is a wasted effort, as the androids are far too powerful for either Gohan or Trunks. It's only after Trunks has one last, final defeat, so thoroughly handed to him by the androids, that he realizes the hopelessness of his actions and goes through with his mother's plans to send him to the past in an attempt to prevent the androids from ever appearing.This story begins in media res, deep into the time-line of Future Trunks, and never really ends. Fortunately the questions left behind are answered in the series, yet the confusion this movie can create makes it impossible for new fans to watch unless they have seen the Trunks Saga of the DBZ series. And, like the other DBZ movies, a lot of the action is redundant and a bit repetitive, and the movie itself is short. What makes this movie different from the other movies, though, is that it's far more dramatic because of the settings and the past of the characters involved.Still, it's very hard to recommend this to anyone but true fans of DBZ, and only then long-time fans because of the reasons stated above. If you are a true fan, then have at it. This, along with Bardock: The Father of Goku, make great additions to the series and add a lot to the history of the show.",4,The History of a DBZ Favorite,1138147200,"01 25, 2006",2006,2043,"['Bardock', 'Father', 'Goku', 'History', 'Trunks', 'attempts', 'give', 'glimpse', 'past', 'one', 'DBZ', 'characters', 'being', 'Future', 'Trunks', 'Also', 'Bardock', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'movie', 'release', 'special', 'originally', 'aired', 'Japanese', 'TV', 'same', 'similarities', 'movies', 'being', 'relative', 'shortness', 'self-contained', 'adventure.In', 'see', 'start', 'attack', 'androids', 'learn', 'true', 'history', 'what', 'happened', 'Z', 'warriors', 'Left', 'initial', 'destruction', 'Gohan', 'Trunks', 'Trunks', 'yet', 'achieve', 'status', 'Super', 'Saiyan', 'Living', 'destroyed', 'world', 'Gohan', 'Trunks', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'waiting', 'news', 'reveal', 'location', 'androids', 'when', 'not', 'doing', 'are', 'training', 'get', 'stronger', 'wasted', 'effort', 'androids', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'powerful', 'Gohan', 'Trunks', 'only', 'Trunks', 'one', 'last', 'final', 'defeat', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'handed', 'androids', 'hopelessness', 'actions', 'mother', 'plans', 'send', 'past', 'attempt', 'prevent', 'androids', 'ever', 'appearing.This', 'story', 'media', 'res', 'deep', 'time-line', 'Future', 'Trunks', 'never', 'really', 'Fortunately', 'questions', 'left', 'behind', 'are', 'answered', 'series', 'confusion', 'movie', 'can', 'create', 'impossible', 'new', 'fans', 'watch', 'have', 'seen', 'Trunks', 'Saga', 'DBZ', 'series', 'other', 'DBZ', 'movies', 'lot', 'action', 'redundant', 'bit', 'repetitive', 'movie', 'short', 'What', 'movie', 'different', 'other', 'movies', 'far', 'more', 'dramatic', 'settings', 'past', 'characters', 'involved.Still', 'very', 'hard', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'true', 'fans', 'DBZ', 'only', 'then', 'long-time', 'fans', 'reasons', 'stated', 'above', 'are', 'true', 'fan', 'then', 'have', 'Bardock', 'Father', 'Goku', 'make', 'great', 'additions', 'series', 'add', 'lot', 'history', 'show']",N/A

Goku is dead in result of a heart virus. Only two fighters remain, a 13 year old boy named Trunks, and Gohan, the only son of Goku. These two young fighters are determined to put an end to these vicious monsters once and for all. But they didn't have enough power. Even Gohan, the only boy who surpasses his father's powers, was killed in battle with the Androids. Now it's up to Trunks to save the world by doing one thing...travel trough time ! His mission, to give Goku then antitdote, warn others about the Androids, and change the course of time ! Sounds intresting, huh ? Well it is !

There is a huge mystery as to where exactly trunks came from, how bad it really was, and how devistating the androids really were.  Believe me, any questions you may of had, are definetly answered here in this dvd.The story starts off  explaining the ""real"" story line to Dragon Ball Z, as to where Goku gets infected with a radical new strain of virus, which affects super saiyans.  He passes away, and six months after that, the androids show up, and start destroying everything.  Vegeta, Krillin, Yamcha, Tien, Chizazu, and Piccillo all fell to the androids awesome power.  (excuse me if I misspelled any of their names)  All that were left was Trunks, and Gohan.  I don't want to give away any more, so just to sum it up (for those who actually saw the series), alot of fighting and battling, and then he decides to travel to the past to give Goku the antidote, and to warn him of the dangers to take place in 3 years from that point.Watch the dvd, and really see something.  I still like to watch it even though I have seen it a couple dozen times.  The one last thing that you must know, is the two languages play a key role in this dvd.

And I am obviously none to late.  Like many fans of DBZ, I had never seen a uncut version of the series before, and was looking forward to seeing DBZ in all its uncensored glory.  Well, when I was watching this tape, I kept waiting and waiting for the promised &quot;violence and brief nudity&quot; that the back of the box had promised.  Man, was I tricked!  As far as nudity goes, there  WAS NONE.  And as for violence, well, it was no more violent than your average episode of DBZ that airs on Cartoon Network.  Beware, the company that puts out this video, Funimation, has a funny idea of who sees these videos.  They think that 3 and 4 year olds will be watching these tapes.  Hence, they think when someone gets hit with a laser blast, and then disappears in a puff of smoke, that this is &quot;extreme violence.&quot;  All I can say is that I would rate this video &quot;Rated G&quot; and is good clean fun for all ages.  But, if you are like me, and want to see the real DBZ, uncensored, straight from Japan, then keep looking.I see from past reviews of this video, that people use words like &quot;good enough&quot; and &quot;have to make do.&quot;  These are the words of people who have given up hope!  Don't listen to these defeated people!  They have been brainwashed by Funimation propaganda into believeing that this so called uncut video, is in fact what DBZ really is.  I am here to say that it is not!  If you take home anything from this review, let it be this:  Beware Funimation!  They distort and censor every episode of DBZ they get their hands on.  They say it is uncut, but that is a lie!  Don't be fooled!  Don't buy censored videos!  Don't buy funimation videos!!

Spoor ""Author, Gamer, Geek God""","[0, 0]","Well, the REAL essential background of DBZ consists of the entirety of the original Dragon Ball series, but aside from that, one of the most critical turning points in DBZ is the beginning of the Android/Cell Game story arc, where a mysterious young man named &quot;Trunks&quot; shows up to warn the Z-warriors of an impending terrible threat to their world and to offer them a way to save Goku (who is currently missing).This DVD tells us the story of Trunks' true origin -- child of Bulma and Vegita, raised in a darker version of Dragon World in which most of the Z-team were killed by a group of superpowered androids (jinzou ningen, &quot;artificial humans&quot;) designed by Dr. Gear, formerly of the Red Ribbon organization (which was a close parallel to James Bond's SPECTRE). Red Ribbon had been destroyed by Son Goku when Goku was a boy, due to their killing one of Goku's friends; this had killed off Gear's research gravy train and Gear's been looking for revenge ever since. The only survivor of the original Z-warriors is a much bigger, tougher Son Gohan, who tries to train Trunks as a warrior too.The two of them try to fight the androids (#17 and #18) but are simply unable to match them. In the end, it becomes clear that there is only one way to stop the eventual victory of the machines: go back in time, using a machine Bulma has designed, and prevent the death of Goku and his friends.Toriyama's intentional riffs on Terminator and Alien show clearly in this background special, but it's no less effective for all of that. In a sense, Trunks' position is even more grim than that of Terminator's original hero: what he does WILL NOT CHANGE HIS FUTURE. All it will do is make possible that ANOTHER version of him will have a better future than he does. His actions are purely noble, to ensure that somehow, somewhere, there will be a better world, even if he and his mother will never see it.",5,The second essential background DBZ disk,1066348800,"10 17, 2003",2003,1913,"['Well', 'REAL', 'essential', 'background', 'DBZ', 'entirety', 'original', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'series', 'aside', 'one', 'most', 'critical', 'turning', 'points', 'DBZ', 'beginning', 'Android/Cell', 'Game', 'story', 'arc', 'where', 'mysterious', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'quot', 'Trunks', 'quot', 'warn', 'Z-warriors', 'impending', 'terrible', 'threat', 'world', 'offer', 'way', 'save', 'Goku', 'who', 'currently', 'missing', '.This', 'DVD', 'story', 'Trunks', 'true', 'origin', 'child', 'Bulma', 'Vegita', 'raised', 'darker', 'version', 'Dragon', 'World', 'most', 'Z-team', 'were', 'killed', 'group', 'superpowered', 'androids', 'jinzou', 'ningen', 'quot', 'artificial', 'humans', 'quot', 'designed', 'Dr.', 'Gear', 'formerly', 'Red', 'Ribbon', 'organization', 'was', 'close', 'parallel', 'James', 'Bond', 'SPECTRE', 'Red', 'Ribbon', 'had', 'been', 'destroyed', 'Son', 'Goku', 'when', 'Goku', 'was', 'boy', 'due', 'killing', 'one', 'Goku', 'friends', 'had', 'killed', 'off', 'Gear', 'research', 'gravy', 'train', 'Gear', 'been', 'looking', 'revenge', 'ever', 'only', 'survivor', 'original', 'Z-warriors', 'much', 'bigger', 'tougher', 'Son', 'Gohan', 'who', 'train', 'Trunks', 'warrior', 'too.The', 'two', 'try', 'fight', 'androids', '17', '18', 'are', 'simply', 'unable', 'match', 'end', 'clear', 'only', 'one', 'way', 'stop', 'eventual', 'victory', 'machines', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'using', 'machine', 'Bulma', 'designed', 'prevent', 'death', 'Goku', 'friends.Toriyama', 'intentional', 'riffs', 'Terminator', 'Alien', 'show', 'clearly', 'background', 'special', 'less', 'effective', 'sense', 'Trunks', 'position', 'even', 'more', 'grim', 'Terminator', 'original', 'hero', 'what', 'WILL', 'NOT', 'CHANGE', 'HIS', 'FUTURE', 'will', 'do', 'make', 'possible', 'ANOTHER', 'version', 'will', 'have', 'better', 'future', 'actions', 'are', 'purely', 'noble', 'ensure', 'somehow', 'somewhere', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'world', 'even', 'mother', 'will', 'never', 'see']",N/A

From there after a short while two androids appear.  These Androids cause all sorts of mayhem, unitl Piccolo, Gohan, Yamcha, Vegeta, Kirllion, Tien and Chowsu appear.  At the end of that Battle only Gohan survives.  We then are pushed to ten years later.  Gohan is now in his early 20's and Trunks is in his teens.  The andriods don't want to destroy the world, they just want to have fun.  Gohan continually fightsd them to try and stop them but his no match for them.  From there Trunks begs him to train him and he does.  Eventually Trunks learns on how to become SUper Sayin but in one of the early battles he is almost killed, and Gohan suffers greatly.  Towards the end we witness Gohan dying and in the end Trunks leaving to try and change the future.This could of tied in so easily to the series.  It's amazing that it didn't.
