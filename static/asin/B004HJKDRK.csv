1408715,A33WAXM7XI8DQN,B004HJKDRK,"A. Sessler ""AniMason""","[3, 4]","Somewhere between Twilight and Underworld is where I found myself while enjoying, Dance in the Vampire Bund. It's maturity while engaging in several of the series' few action scenes and pre-established hierarchy within this universe resembles that of an Underworld-esque nature and is what should be expected within this domain(So expect gore & nudity). As for the romance element, it resonates that of a soft yet complex love story.Keep in mind though, Dance in the Vampire Bund, is primarily a Romance and its action elements are less of a focus than the relationship of the two main characters. It is also quite political in nature, being as the premise of this series mainly revolves around the creation of, 'The Vampire Bund' or, a sanctuary where vampires' existences can be acknowledged but, may  remain secluded from mainland. The conflict revolving around this, is that of the prejudice of ""man"" and the resentment of several associated vampire clans, with this choice.Dance in the Vampire Bund, is a good series within its genre but, sadly stumbles where most Anime has before, in establishing a conclusion to its series/season.",4,A Twilit Underworld,1311552000,"07 25, 2011",2011,1138,"['Somewhere', 'Twilight', 'Underworld', 'where', 'found', 'enjoying', 'Dance', 'Vampire', 'Bund', 'maturity', 'engaging', 'several', 'series', 'few', 'action', 'scenes', 'pre-established', 'hierarchy', 'universe', 'Underworld-esque', 'nature', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'expected', 'domain', 'So', 'expect', 'gore', 'nudity', 'romance', 'element', 'soft', 'yet', 'complex', 'love', 'story.Keep', 'mind', 'Dance', 'Vampire', 'Bund', 'primarily', 'Romance', 'action', 'elements', 'are', 'less', 'focus', 'relationship', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'also', 'quite', 'political', 'nature', 'being', 'premise', 'series', 'mainly', 'creation', ""'The"", 'Vampire', 'Bund', 'sanctuary', 'where', 'vampires', 'existences', 'can', 'be', 'acknowledged', 'may', 'remain', 'secluded', 'mainland', 'conflict', 'revolving', 'prejudice', 'man', 'resentment', 'several', 'associated', 'vampire', 'clans', 'choice.Dance', 'Vampire', 'Bund', 'good', 'series', 'genre', 'sadly', 'where', 'most', 'Anime', 'before', 'establishing', 'conclusion', 'series/season']",N/A

""raven cat""","[2, 3]","When I really started to get into anime, I thought that Moonphase was one of the best series ever when it came to telling the story about a cute female vampire and the man who is entrusted to protect her. Subsequently I bought the boxed set...Then I saw Dance in the Vampire Bund and kicked myself for not buying it instead of Moonphase..I have to say that this anime is a MUST HAVE for ANYONE who is into vampires, whether you like anime or not. Before looking at any other vampire series, I would check thism one out as it has the elegance contained in titles like Vampire Knight and Black Blood Brothers, and yet the stylishness and grit that Karin, Moonphase, and Rosario+Vampire don't even come close to. Mina Tepes exudes %1000 more cute-factor that any other vampire anime heroine I can think of (AND DOESN'T NEED CAT EARS) yet Mina is also brave and intelligent, as opposed to being bumbling and insecure about her vampire ststus. You get the sense from the end of the first episode that she is a leader, and though she acts sweet at times she IS the ruler of the vampires. You will not forget that. This series is not meant to be pretty and cute in the sense that say, Karin or Rosario+Vampire is (it's rated TV-MA), but Mina Tepes really puts an effort into her Lolita style :D In that sense the series is pretty.The animation is beautifully crisp, the sound quality is excellent (Dolby Digital HD), and the storytelling alone is enough to give this anime five stars.You will love how vampires and warewolves are related in an unexpected way.

As I have another production version and not this particular product, I can only recommend the series but I am sure the product offered here should meet or surpass one's expectations.This story is about a vampire queen looking for a safe homeland for vampires,the ""good"" ones willing to leave the general population alone,a place for those that chose not to engage in the vampire lifestyle by pulling out their fangs,etc. The adult queen has transformed her body into that of a 10-year-old because if she is of a mature age she must choose one of the three vampire family heads to marry and thus propetuate the vampire royal boodline. As she does not wish to lay down with any of them and wishes to,instead, spend her life with her chosen boyfriend,she refuses to show her mature body,which creates the tension for the storyline.Her chosen one starts out the series as a teenager in a local highschool that has no memory of his history longer than a year ago. There is,of course, a girl that wishes to care for him,etc., but,unlike too many such storylines, this girl ""matures"" as the plot thickens, but,to tell more would give too much away. He,on the other hand,take forever to catch on to the multible romantics that begin to swirl around him. In other words,typical male behavior. His role in the storyline,however,is crucial to the plot.The student body president,a female,is the principle player in a branch story that has a few surprises,especially with most anime series about students usually portraying student leaders as too stiff and unwilling/unable to mature or change. Most would,I think, will find the outcome of this sub-plot both surprising and not entirely unpleasant.There is very limited fan service and nudity,in any form, is virtualy non-existant.This is a very good series to get involved with and it remains up to the individual buyers if the product offered here is within their budget.",5,Dance in the Vampire Bund,1301875200,"04 4, 2011",2011,2005,"['series', 'easy', '4-41/2', 'stars', 'creativity', 'art', 'storyline', 'character', 'developement', 'have', 'production', 'version', 'not', 'particular', 'product', 'can', 'only', 'recommend', 'series', 'am', 'sure', 'product', 'offered', 'here', 'should', 'meet', 'surpass', 'one', 'expectations.This', 'story', 'vampire', 'queen', 'looking', 'safe', 'homeland', 'vampires', 'good', 'ones', 'willing', 'leave', 'general', 'population', 'alone', 'place', 'chose', 'not', 'engage', 'vampire', 'lifestyle', 'pulling', 'out', 'fangs', 'etc', 'adult', 'queen', 'transformed', 'body', '10-year-old', 'mature', 'age', 'must', 'choose', 'one', 'three', 'vampire', 'family', 'heads', 'marry', 'thus', 'propetuate', 'vampire', 'royal', 'boodline', 'not', 'wish', 'lay', 'down', 'wishes', 'instead', 'spend', 'life', 'chosen', 'boyfriend', 'show', 'mature', 'body', 'tension', 'storyline.Her', 'chosen', 'one', 'series', 'teenager', 'local', 'highschool', 'memory', 'history', 'longer', 'year', 'ago', 'course', 'girl', 'care', 'etc.', 'too', 'many', 'such', 'storylines', 'girl', 'matures', 'plot', 'thickens', 'tell', 'more', 'would', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'other', 'hand', 'take', 'forever', 'catch', 'multible', 'romantics', 'begin', 'swirl', 'other', 'words', 'typical', 'male', 'behavior', 'role', 'storyline', 'however', 'crucial', 'plot.The', 'student', 'body', 'president', 'female', 'principle', 'player', 'branch', 'story', 'few', 'surprises', 'especially', 'most', 'anime', 'series', 'students', 'usually', 'portraying', 'student', 'leaders', 'too', 'stiff', 'unwilling/unable', 'mature', 'change', 'Most', 'would', 'think', 'will', 'find', 'outcome', 'sub-plot', 'surprising', 'not', 'entirely', 'unpleasant.There', 'very', 'limited', 'fan', 'service', 'nudity', 'form', 'virtualy', 'non-existant.This', 'very', 'good', 'series', 'get', 'involved', 'up', 'individual', 'buyers', 'product', 'offered', 'here', 'budget']",N/A

Then found out that the North American release was likely to fall victim to the infamous US Kiddy Porn Panic, so decided to shell out USD 16 and find out what the fuss was about.In passing: it is beyond my understanding why this latest version of the Madness of Crowds should have chosen to target a visual arts genre that has never, in its entire existence, displayed a picture of a real child - or, indeed, of a real anything.  But abnormal psychology is not my forte, so back to the review.It's not too good.  The palette is very sombre, mostly black, gray and sepia.  No primary colours except a lot of red - blood red, if you get my meaning.  And the animation is poor: many still shots and pan shots, not much fluid motion even in the fight scenes.The story begins badly.  The mysterious high school, the goofy girls in short skirts, the boys forming rival clubs and bullying each other, ... Oh, and a hero with amnesia who has forgotten he's a werewolf.  Yawn.  But if you persevere, it does improve.  The series is divided into two main arcs: episodes 1 to 7 tell the story of how the Vampire Queen created a save haven for her fellow vampires - the Bund of the title.  The second arc, episodes 8 to 12, is about the rivalry between old vampire families.  It fills in some of the back story, but leaves enough loose ends to suggest a sequel.Overall, the story is watchable, interesting, and dense enough to repay more than one viewing.  The character development is also well done, and often quite moving.As other have mentioned, Mira the Vampire Queen is drawn as a young girl.  She has exactly one nude scene - in episode 2 - and there is no visible sexual connotation whatever. A bit of verbal banter about her ""immature body"", but very tame. In fact, most of the scene is a fight scene.  The other nude scene - in episode 11 - involves a female shape-shifting monster, who during a deadly battle with the hero briefly transforms into human form to distract him.However, there is a lot of graphic violence.  Stabbing, dismemberment, vampire biting, and all with realistically drawn blood.  The local film board gave this anime a PG-13 rating, and I agree.

The anime is not the manga. so don't be disappointed. given the ongoing status of the manga series (which is highly entertaining) and the need to adapt for anime format, the story has undergone a few significant changes that give it more of a sense of resolution than the manga does. so know that you are watching a different story (and different style of art as well - looks more like Bakemonogatari than the manga).2. While not the manga, the anime version is still quite entertaining and enjoyable. Dance, while certainly just another vampire story, does a good job mixing up the modern and the typical cast of mythical characters so that one doesn't feel like this is Blade redux. While not groundbreaking story work, i found myself pretty engrossed. the role of the Werewolves is pretty sweet.3. as you can tell just from the cover (and more so from the opening credits), Dance plays up the loli theme pretty directly. While tame by other loli standards and not a deal breaker by any means, for those who might be uncomfortable with content of that sort, this would be good to note before investing in watching. I found it tolerable, though i had a few uncomfortable moments. and, generally, the content is pretty edgy. which is fine if you like that, but might be a turn-off if you don't.overall, i recommend with the above warnings.",4,not the manga. but not bad. oh...and a loli alert.,1303689600,"04 25, 2011",2011,1430,"['few', 'quick', 'points', 'know', 'series', 'help', 'gauge', 'want', 'watch', 'it.1', 'anime', 'not', 'manga', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'given', 'ongoing', 'status', 'manga', 'series', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'need', 'adapt', 'anime', 'format', 'story', 'undergone', 'few', 'significant', 'changes', 'give', 'more', 'sense', 'resolution', 'manga', 'so', 'know', 'are', 'watching', 'different', 'story', 'different', 'style', 'art', 'well', 'more', 'Bakemonogatari', 'manga', '.2', 'not', 'manga', 'anime', 'version', 'still', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'enjoyable', 'Dance', 'certainly', 'just', 'vampire', 'story', 'good', 'job', 'mixing', 'up', 'modern', 'typical', 'cast', 'mythical', 'characters', 'so', 'one', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Blade', 'redux', 'not', 'groundbreaking', 'story', 'work', 'i', 'found', 'pretty', 'engrossed', 'role', 'Werewolves', 'pretty', 'sweet.3', 'can', 'tell', 'just', 'cover', 'more', 'so', 'opening', 'credits', 'Dance', 'up', 'loli', 'theme', 'pretty', 'directly', 'tame', 'other', 'loli', 'standards', 'not', 'deal', 'breaker', 'means', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'uncomfortable', 'content', 'sort', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'note', 'investing', 'watching', 'found', 'tolerable', 'i', 'had', 'few', 'uncomfortable', 'moments', 'generally', 'content', 'pretty', 'edgy', 'fine', 'like', 'might', 'be', 'turn-off', ""don't.overall"", 'i', 'recommend', 'above', 'warnings']",N/A
