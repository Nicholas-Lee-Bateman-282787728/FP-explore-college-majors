This series does not involve itself with humanity, but rather what happens to the things we would leave behind, and how well would nature reclaim everything.

1334489,A370Z6I5GBWU44,B0039ZBM3C,"M ""Delicious Strawberry""","[26, 27]","Overall, this was an enjoyable season. Of course, some episodes are better than others, but if you've seen LAP Season 1, you might like this. It's a cool look at how we have affected the world, and how different things would fare against Nature. And as anyone familiar with LAP knows, each episode is filled with puns and allusions to the theme of that episode. I have rated each episode with its own stars. Please note that '1/2' is a half star on its own.2.01 - Wrath of God *** Overall a okay episode (compared to any other LAP episode) I'm disappointed that they didn't concentrate on other religious monuments/other religions (Jerusalem, Dome on the Rock, the Kaaba/Mecca, Buddhist/Tao/Shinto shrines, Buddha statues, etc) It was interesting learning what would happen to the Crystal Cathedral and the statue of the Redeemer. This ep also talks about snakes and black cats (since they were seen as symbols of Satan) along with sheepdogs (the puppies are freaking adorable) Why sheepdogs, you ask? Well, they protect a FLOCK (this was actually milked quite a bit by the writers for puns), and the Latin word for shepherd is pastor. Fascinating, no?2.02 - Toxic Revenge ** Rather disappointing, actually. They talked about radiation, chlorine, and methane. The parts focusing on poisons was cool to watch, and the town with all the sinkholes was gnarly. But there's plenty of other poisons (mercury, household chemicals, chemicals at factories, etc) It was just mainly three different poisons they talked about and that's it :(2.03 - Crypt of Civilization *** Fairly interesting episode, talking about safes, time capsules, etc. Only they didn't say what would HAPPEN to the time capsules with no one to open them. They just said a lot of people buried them especially in the 50's, but they said nothing about how long a capsule would keep its contents safe, and they mentioned that safes only offered so much protection against fire, but what of safes held in humid and warm places, or safes left completely undisturbed? Not every safe is gonna end up in a fire, anyway. So as far as this episode was concerned, it was not THAT good. I did like learning about the 10,000 year clock though.2.04 - Last Supper **** Overall a great episode that managed to remain mostly on topic, but the one big sore spot of this ep was that they talked about some stupid  sanitarium, instead of talking about what would happen to farmland, how long farmland would go to seed or which crops would survive naturally. No, they had to talk about some stupid ****ing sanitarium (moisture and mold is destroying it blah blah, same **** thing that happens to all buildings eventually), what did this HAVE to do with the theme of this episode?2.05 - Home Wrecked Home **** Overall a great episode. It actually managed to stay on topic for the most part, so I can't really complain about this one, though I'd have liked to see how long it would take a trailer or mobile home to fall apart without maintenance. Also, this episode talked about household items - shoes, photographs, clothing, CDs and DVDs. Very cool.2.06 - Holiday Hell *** An okay episode. I never thought fruitcake could last so long, though they mainly focused on Christmas (fruitcake and a Christmas store), Thanksgiving (turkeys), and Fourth of July (firework factories). Before this aired, its summary included Christmas tree farms, but the actual episode was lacking in Christmas trees. Also, there was no mention of Halloween (pumpkin farms, candy) or New Years (alcohol/champagne, the ball in Times Square)2.07 - Waves of Devastation ***1/2 Overall an okay episode. It showed what happens to seaside towns (Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Santa Monica Pier) along with Sacramento (after the dam breaks) One blooper, though... the Sydney Opera House is shown to collapse before the Sydney Harbor Bridge, but when they show the bridge itself collapsing, you can see the Opera House still intact behind the bridge!2.08 - Sky's the Limit **1/2 Overall another okay episode about aviation and sky-related stuff. They talked about a lot of things, but they never said what will happen to regular commercial airplanes or private jets (they just talked about Air Force One), or helicopters and blimps.2.09 - Depths of Destruction ***** Really cool and fun episode, I LOVED the underwater garden, and the Bonne Terre mine was also a great place to discuss in this episode.2.10 - Take Me To Your Leader **** Overall cool episode. If this episode had more time, it could have covered other cool places such as the Buckingham Palace, the Emperor's Palace (in Japan) more about the Forbidden City (since it's a collection of buildings, not just one structure like Versailles or the White House) and perhaps the Winter Palace or one of the other palaces that was used by the Romanovs before the Russian Revolution. (be interesting to see how this would survive given Russia's cold winters) or one of the palaces to be found in the Middle East owned by one of the Saudi royals. (which would contrast with a Russian palace clime-wise) You also learn a lot of cool trivia about the White House in this episode, as well as the ages old question of 'Who is buried in Grant's Tomb?'Part of me hopes there will be a Season 3. There's still a few things they haven't explored, but part of me also thinks they should stop now. If they ever get around to a Season 3, I hope they are more careful about writing their episodes and keeping them on topic without being repetitive. But if they decide Season 2 is the end of it, that's fine with me. Overall, I would give this entire season 3 and a half stars, 3.75 at most. Of course, Amazon doesn't let me give out fractioned stars, so I guess I'll just give it a four.",4,Entertaining,1277078400,"06 21, 2010",2010,5731,"['Overall', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'season', 'course',
