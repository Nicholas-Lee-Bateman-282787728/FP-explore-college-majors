A lot of it won't be new to you, but there were a few things in it that I hadn't known, and it's interesting to hear all the stories from the people who've been with and around the band throughout it's history.On the downside, there are some inaccuracies.  For example, it says that Megadeth's ""Countdown to Extinction"" debuted at number 2, but that Metallica's self-titled album came out afterwards and debuted at number 1.  But actually, ""Countdown to Extinction"" came out A YEAR AFTER Metallica's self-titled album (Metallica's album came out in the summer of 1991; ""Countdown"" came out in the summer of 1992).A good look at the band, but unfortunately, the happy ending they close with didn't last.  Mustaine suffered an injury and ended Megadeth's run about 6 months or so after this DVD came out.  He later released the final Megadeth album, ""The System Has Failed"", which is really a Dave Mustaine solo album released under the Megadeth banner to fulfill contractual obligations (and Dave admits this -- but regardless of whose name is on the front, it's a fantastic album -- Mustaine's best in years.)",4,An interesting look at Megadeth,1102636800,"12 10, 2004",2004,1182,"[""'re"", 'Megadeth', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'love', 'DVD', 'bottom', 'line', 'lot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'new', 'were', 'few', 'things', 'had', ""n't"", 'known', 'interesting', 'hear', 'stories', 'people', 'who', ""'ve"", 'been', 'band', 'downside', 'are', 'inaccuracies', 'example', 'Megadeth', 'Countdown', 'Extinction', 'debuted', 'number', '2', 'Metallica', 'self-titled', 'album', 'came', 'out', 'afterwards', 'debuted', 'number', '1', 'actually', 'Countdown', 'Extinction', 'came', 'out', 'A', 'YEAR', 'AFTER', 'Metallica', 'self-titled', 'album', 'Metallica', 'album', 'came', 'out', 'summer', '1991', 'Countdown', 'came', 'out', 'summer', '1992', '.A', 'good', 'look', 'band', 'unfortunately', 'happy', 'ending', 'close', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'Mustaine', 'suffered', 'injury', 'ended', 'Megadeth', 'run', '6', 'months', 'so', 'DVD', 'came', 'out', 'later', 'released', 'final', 'Megadeth', 'album', 'System', 'Has', 'Failed', 'really', 'Dave', 'Mustaine', 'solo', 'album', 'released', 'Megadeth', 'banner', 'fulfill', 'contractual', 'obligations', 'Dave', 'regardless', 'name', 'front', 'fantastic', 'album', 'Mustaine', 'best', 'years']",N/A

So when VH1 aired an episode of &quot;Behind The Music&quot; devoted to Megadeth, I watched and even recorded it.  I knew that the show was released commercially by the band on dvd, but initially didn't see any point in buying it because I'd taped it off of VH1.  However I found out later that the dvd features an extended version of the show, and has some extra stuff, so I decided to buy the dvd.  I'm really glad I did!  First of all, the &quot;Behind the Music&quot; episode has a lot of footage that must've got cut to fit the show into VH1's time requirements.  The extra footage is really good and gives a lot more background about the band.  Also included as a bonus feature on the dvd is some extra interview footage with various people.  You also get the &quot;Moto Psycho&quot; music video too.  I also really liked the layout of the dvd menus.  Very nicely done, with a different Megadeth song playing at each menu.  If you're even hesitating about buying this, DON'T!  If you're a Megadeth fan at all, you won't be dissapointed.",5,Worth the money...extended version of VH1 special.,1013040000,"02 7, 2002",2002,1087,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Megadeth', '80', 'So', 'when', 'VH1', 'aired', 'episode', 'quot', 'Music', 'quot', 'devoted', 'Megadeth', 'watched', 'even', 'recorded', 'knew', 'show', 'was', 'released', 'commercially', 'band', 'dvd', 'initially', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'point', 'buying', ""'d"", 'taped', 'VH1', 'However', 'found', 'out', 'later', 'dvd', 'extended', 'version', 'show', 'extra', 'stuff', 'decided', 'buy', 'dvd', ""'m"", 'really', 'glad', 'did', 'First', 'all', 'quot', 'Music', 'quot', 'episode', 'lot', 'footage', 'must', ""'ve"", 'got', 'cut', 'fit', 'show', 'VH1', 'time', 'requirements', 'extra', 'footage', 'really', 'good', 'lot', 'more', 'background', 'band', 'Also', 'included', 'bonus', 'feature', 'dvd', 'extra', 'interview', 'footage', 'various', 'people', 'also', 'get', 'quot', 'Moto', 'Psycho', 'quot', 'music', 'video', 'too', 'also', 'really', 'liked', 'layout', 'dvd', 'menus', 'Very', 'nicely', 'done', 'different', 'Megadeth', 'song', 'playing', 'menu', ""'re"", 'even', 'hesitating', 'buying', 'DO', ""N'T"", ""'re"", 'Megadeth', 'fan', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'dissapointed']",N/A

For example, there is no chapter list and the ""bonus footage"" is 10 minutes of tour manager, managers, etc..(a few from Lars & James, Chris Polland). The 1hr 16 minute behind the music is good but it moved to fast at times...It would have been nice to see at least ONE concert shot with live music and without all the panning and flashes going on to hype up the story. It seemed to focus more on Dave Mustaine and his drug problems than anything else...but I guess that's understandable when he's the one who formed the band in 1984(?). They also could have more interview time with Marty Friedman, who unquestionably, played with the band during their most productive years. And where the hell was Nick Menza?! This guy was their BEST drummer, why wasn't he on this documentary? If you are a fan, this DVD is worth getting...it was just short of expectations but entertaining nevertheless.

I watched what originally aired on VH-1 and was bitterly disappointed. The extras on this dvd are somewhat mollifying, but still it lingers.For years, more than I can remember now, I was(and still am) enthralled with Dave Mustaine. His intelligence and lyrical mastery far surpassed that of his peers. And the music itself, well, I can't explain the genius of the speed, the melody, and the control that he/they have over it all.But instead of showing the almost palpable intensity and intelligence that Mustaine emanates, the show fell back on the drug abuse and excess that would make of Megadeth little more than another hair band. I knew, just as any other fan would know, that there was trouble in the band with sobriety, but where Mustaine and the boys decided to move on, the show did not.Perhaps I watched this with wishful expectations. I wanted the band to be honored, as they have never been give their due, and felt that the concentration was too heavily focused on the chaos rather than the balance.I'm giving this dvd four stars because it is a must for any Megadeth fan despite what I see as its failings(which is just my opinion.)And the extras are really great. Since MTV has give their videos no air time, it's wonderful to be able to see them at all.If you love the band as much as I do, if you want to see them praised, I wouldn't recommend watching this with the same mindset that I did.

673089,A5R3U8ZSFKAL4,B00005OW00,"Paul Lawrence ""'EJL'""","[2, 2]","As part of the rolling VH1 Behind the Music series a `Dave hour' - as James Hetfield calls it in the extra material - is fully justified. Regardless of the fact that Mustaines public persona has not always been overly warm and fuzzy the fact that he is so much a part of the metal music scene of the last quarter of a century means that a solid expose of his life in the music thus far is totally warranted.The show starts with a run through of early years travails which do to a certain extent explain some of the places Mustaine is coming from. From there we get a bunch of talking heads of varying degrees of validity and in trugh most of them do add something to the brew. We get members past and present, Lars Ulrich and Heftield and the usual cast of managers etc.What is uplifting to see, but at times difficult to watch, is the honesty of James, Lars and Dave in discussing aspects of the early years and especially the honesty of Dave in discussing his descent into drug hell as well as being strong enough to admit he wasn't strong enough to beat the drugs until well over a dozen attempts. I'm not going to spoil it for you by describing any of the elements in detail in this review, but I will point out that even if you aren't a fan of Megadeth then picking up this release may be a bit of an eye opener - a window into the world and past of one of the men of metal who actually gives good interview.Megadeth fans really should buy this, others interested in thrash and metal should probably try to get it cheap and add it to their DVD collection too and while the extended version doesn't really seem much different to the standard version which I've never seen, it's a no brainer which to choose if you can get either for much the same price.",4,Warts 'n' All,1249516800,"08 6, 2009",2009,1757,"['part', 'rolling', 'VH1', 'Music', 'series', 'Dave', 'hour', 'James', 'Hetfield', 'extra', 'material', 'fully', 'justified', 'Regardless', 'fact', 'Mustaines', 'public', 'persona', 'not', 'always', 'been', 'overly', 'warm', 'fact', 'so', 'much', 'part', 'metal', 'music', 'scene', 'last', 'quarter', 'century', 'solid', 'expose', 'life', 'music', 'thus', 'far', 'totally', 'warranted.The', 'show', 'run', 'early', 'years', 'travails', 'do', 'certain', 'extent', 'explain', 'places', 'Mustaine', 'coming', 'get', 'bunch', 'talking', 'heads', 'varying', 'degrees', 'validity', 'trugh', 'most', 'do', 'add', 'something', 'brew', 'get', 'members', 'past', 'present', 'Lars', 'Ulrich', 'Heftield', 'usual', 'cast', 'managers', 'uplifting', 'see', 'times', 'difficult', 'watch', 'honesty', 'James', 'Lars', 'Dave', 'discussing', 'aspects', 'early', 'years', 'especially', 'honesty', 'Dave', 'discussing', 'descent', 'drug', 'hell', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'strong', 'enough', 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'strong', 'enough', 'beat', 'drugs', 'well', 'dozen', 'attempts', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'spoil', 'describing', 'elements', 'detail', 'review', 'will', 'point', 'out', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'fan', 'Megadeth', 'then', 'picking', 'up', 'release', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'eye', 'opener', 'window', 'world', 'past', 'one', 'men', 'metal', 'who', 'actually', 'good', 'interview.Megadeth', 'fans', 'really', 'should', 'buy', 'others', 'interested', 'thrash', 'metal', 'should', 'probably', 'try', 'get', 'cheap', 'add', 'DVD', 'collection', 'too', 'extended', 'version', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'much', 'different', 'standard', 'version', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'brainer', 'choose', 'can', 'get', 'much', 'same', 'price']",N/A
