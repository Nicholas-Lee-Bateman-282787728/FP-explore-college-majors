1508872,A1DU8G4KYPXP09,B006328QWI,Anne Omniuss,"[4, 5]","I generally love classic English lit and film adaptations of these stories.  I will admit that Wuthering Heights has never been a particular favorite but I was curious to see how they'd adapted it for this film.  The film is two hours long and has very little dialog.  It moves at a glacial pace and was so vague I had to explain most of the plot to my husband who hadn't read the book because he couldn't follow the story at all.  There are long lingering, sometimes out of focus shots of people standing on windy peaks, insects buzzing in windows and people being cruel to animals.  We get to see Heathcliff kill a goat, a rabbit and a dog.  I understand that the Yorkshire moors are almost another character in the book but not at the sacrifice of plot.  The actual ending of the book is not there.  The story basically ends at Cathy Earnshaw's death.  The childhood scenes go on forever and the young actor playing Heathcliff barely talks.  Oh and they've made him black in the movie so instead of him being abused and neglected because of his low class, now the focus is on race.  The n-word is used several times as well as a few other expletives.  Other minor quibble is that the adult actors bear absolutely zero resemblance to the children playing the younger versions of the characters.  Also, for what is supposed to be a story about obsession, passion, and revenge this is a very  dull passionless movie.  I wanted to turn it off after about half an hour and I wish I had.  The film has the look of an art house film so maybe I'm just not sophisticated enough to ""get"" it but when adapting a classic novel, to me, story is far more important than atmosphere and this film is nothing but atmosphere.",2,Too arty for it's own good.,1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,1710,"['generally', 'love', 'classic', 'English', 'lit', 'film', 'adaptations', 'stories', 'will', 'admit', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'never', 'been', 'particular', 'favorite', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'how', ""'d"", 'adapted', 'film', 'film', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'very', 'little', 'dialog', 'glacial', 'pace', 'was', 'so', 'vague', 'had', 'explain', 'most', 'plot', 'husband', 'who', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'could', ""n't"", 'follow', 'story', 'are', 'long', 'lingering', 'sometimes', 'focus', 'shots', 'people', 'standing', 'windy', 'peaks', 'insects', 'buzzing', 'windows', 'people', 'being', 'cruel', 'animals', 'get', 'see', 'Heathcliff', 'kill', 'goat', 'rabbit', 'dog', 'understand', 'Yorkshire', 'moors', 'are', 'almost', 'character', 'book', 'not', 'sacrifice', 'plot', 'actual', 'ending', 'book', 'not', 'there', 'story', 'basically', 'Cathy', 'Earnshaw', 'death', 'childhood', 'scenes', 'go', 'forever', 'young', 'actor', 'playing', 'Heathcliff', 'barely', 'talks', 'Oh', ""'ve"", 'made', 'black', 'movie', 'so', 'instead', 'being', 'abused', 'neglected', 'low', 'class', 'now', 'focus', 'race', 'n-word', 'used', 'several', 'times', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'other', 'expletives', 'Other', 'minor', 'quibble', 'adult', 'actors', 'bear', 'absolutely', 'zero', 'resemblance', 'children', 'playing', 'younger', 'versions', 'characters', 'Also', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'story', 'obsession', 'passion', 'revenge', 'very', 'dull', 'passionless', 'movie', 'wanted', 'turn', 'off', 'hour', 'wish', 'had', 'film', 'look', 'art', 'house', 'film', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'sophisticated', 'enough', 'get', 'when', 'adapting', 'classic', 'novel', 'story', 'far', 'more', 'important', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'nothing', 'atmosphere']",Wuthering Heights 2011
1508873,A3UKQ50DCOIJ01,B006328QWI,Barbara J. Guetti,"[3, 5]","Ten years ago while I was still teaching Emily Bronte in college courses, I read some interesting  scholarly research about the  character, Heathcliff.  The author argued that when  Cathy's father brought the boy home to Wuthering Heights from Liverpool, he had probably bought him as an African salve. LIverpool, notorious as a densely overcrowded city, was also a major slave market, and Heathcliff is spoken of by all those grim Protestant characters who inhabit the Heights,  and who  perpetually scold the children, as  a black demon from Hell.  When I heard about this movie, I realized that the directors were making brilliant use  of this material.  I&#34;m sorry I can't remember the name of the author or the book, but I thought the arguments were very persuasive and by this time I suppose this argument may be familiar to more readers.This information was used, not only in the case of Heathcliff , but in presenting the heroine, Cathy,  as a rough country girl whose everyday speech, as we hear it in the film, is not the rather elevated literary language that Emily Bronte used in her book. The Bronte sisters lived among people who didn't speak &#34;proper&#34; English at all , and the film-makers  did a wonderful job of making us hear what those inhabitants of the Moors must have really sounded like. The immense tragedy of Wuthering Heights is that spontaneous feelings, and spontaneous speech and manners have to be sacrificed or &#34;outgrown&#34; because Cathy has the misfortune of being an Heiress, who must succumb to being coached, and married off, as a respectable young lady.  Cathy's pathetic failure of a brother,  who is finally ruined by Heathcliff, is another example of the difficult passage that all the characters have to make in one way or another.  Bronte is telling us that 'success' and 'refinement'  can become deadly forces of repression, rage,  and disappointment. I thought the actors were all brilliant in carrying off their difficult roles, including the character of Nelly Dean, who is actually the same age as the children, but becomes their surrogate mother and source of comfort. Bronte used a lot of different narrators in the story, most of them outsiders who are very puzzled by the people of the Heights, but Nelly is the most sympathetic and wisest interpreter of these children.",4,Heathcliff and Liverpool,1367020800,"04 27, 2013",2013,2335,"['Ten', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'still', 'teaching', 'Emily', 'Bronte', 'college', 'courses', 'read', 'interesting', 'scholarly', 'research', 'character', 'Heathcliff', 'author', 'argued', 'when', 'Cathy', 'father', 'brought', 'boy', 'home', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'Liverpool', 'had', 'probably', 'bought', 'African', 'salve', 'LIverpool', 'notorious', 'densely', 'overcrowded', 'city', 'was', 'also', 'major', 'slave', 'market', 'Heathcliff', 'spoken', 'grim', 'Protestant', 'characters', 'who', 'inhabit', 'Heights', 'who', 'perpetually', 'scold', 'children', 'black', 'demon', 'Hell', 'When', 'heard', 'movie', 'realized', 'directors', 'were', 'making', 'brilliant', 'use', 'material', '34', 'm', 'sorry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'name', 'author', 'book', 'thought', 'arguments', 'were', 'very', 'persuasive', 'time', 'suppose', 'argument', 'may', 'be', 'familiar', 'more', 'readers.This', 'information', 'was', 'used', 'not', 'only', 'case', 'Heathcliff', 'presenting', 'heroine', 'Cathy', 'rough', 'country', 'girl', 'everyday', 'speech', 'hear', 'film', 'not', 'rather', 'elevated', 'literary', 'language', 'Emily', 'Bronte', 'used', 'book', 'Bronte', 'sisters', 'lived', 'people', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'speak', '34', 'proper', '34', 'English', 'film-makers', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'making', 'hear', 'what', 'inhabitants', 'Moors', 'must', 'have', 'really', 'sounded', 'immense', 'tragedy', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'spontaneous', 'feelings', 'spontaneous', 'speech', 'manners', 'have', 'be', 'sacrificed', '34', 'outgrown', '34', 'Cathy', 'misfortune', 'being', 'Heiress', 'who', 'must', 'succumb', 'being', 'coached', 'married', 'off', 'respectable', 'young', 'lady', 'Cathy', 'pathetic', 'failure', 'brother', 'who', 'finally', 'ruined', 'Heathcliff', 'example', 'difficult', 'passage', 'characters', 'have', 'make', 'one', 'way', 'Bronte', 'telling', ""'success"", 'can', 'become', 'deadly', 'forces', 'repression', 'rage', 'disappointment', 'thought', 'actors', 'were', 'brilliant', 'carrying', 'off', 'difficult', 'roles', 'including', 'character', 'Nelly', 'Dean', 'who', 'actually', 'same', 'age', 'children', 'surrogate', 'mother', 'source', 'comfort', 'Bronte', 'used', 'lot', 'different', 'narrators', 'story', 'most', 'outsiders', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'puzzled', 'people', 'Heights', 'Nelly', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'wisest', 'interpreter', 'children']",Wuthering Heights 2011
1508874,A3KU995HEIFDNG,B006328QWI,Considering Film (Christopher Bruno),"[8, 11]","Andrea Arnold's Heathcliff is sort of a bastard.  Not in the sense that nothing is known of his lineage -- he's just a downright selfish and obstinate bastard.  Of course, in Emily Bronte's novel, he ultimately becomes one, bitter and jaded by the loss of Catherine, the object of his refuted affections, and seeks revenge upon those whom he feels have wronged him.  That mostly happens in the second half of the novel, however, in which Heathcliff manipulates the fates of the succeeding generation in a fairly scathing commentary on the ideas of monarchy, hegemony, propriety, and class.  Most film adaptations omit that rather sizable chunk of the novel in favor of the star-crossed lovers plot that dominates the first half, and Arnold's is no exception.  What distinguishes her version of Wuthering Heights is the idea of The Other in the Hegelian sense of the term, of the master-slave dialectic; it is this intrinsic Otherness that motivates her Heathcliff, even going so far as to imply that his desire for Catherine was borne not out of romantic passion but rather a more simple, self-preserving instinct predicated upon her compassion for this acceded stray.As such, it must be addressed immediately that this is the first production of Wuthering Heights to employ a black actor in the role of Heathcliff -- in fact it employs two: Solomon Glave as the younger Heathcliff and James Howson as the older.  Neither is given very much dialogue, which is another point of distinction for Arnold's unique telling of this story.  This is undoubtedly the most tactile adaptation of Wuthering Heights yet.  The weather has always played a prominent role in the story, but never has it been so palpable.  One feels the sheer force of the elements weighing down upon the characters; it is easy to understand why simply surviving could be considered such an accomplishment on the moors.Arnold's attention to the landscape, not as a distant backdrop but as a living organism within arm's reach, brings to mind the work of Terrence Malick; much like the fields ofDays of Heaven (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray] or the jungles ofThe Thin Red Line (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray], the moors of Wuthering Heights communicate more about the characters' priorities than the dialogue, illuminating their most basic motivations and concerns.  Heathcliff is shown gently touching the flora, diligently digging the earth, and stolidly breaking stone, more in communion with the ground below and the sky above than with the humans circumjacent to him.Heathcliff is first shown compassion when Mr. Earnshaw (Paul Hilton) takes him into his home, but it is of the Christian ""Now I can make you one of my own"" variety.  He is treated like an animal -- and explicitly called as much -- by the rest of the Earnshaws, save for Catherine (Shannon Beer, and later Kaya Scodelario), who herself seems to be an outsider among her family.  Whereas everyone else tries to ""civilize"" Heathcliff, Catherine instead tries to understand and to relate with him.  She appeals to his senses, teaching him the different birds by the touch of their feathers.  They go horseback riding together, Heathcliff rapturously inhaling the scent of her billowing hair and luxuriating in the gentle rocking of their bodies against one another.  They share their first -- and most -- intimate moment pinning one another down in the mud.Discounting these fleeting moments, however, Heathcliff is staunchly entrenched as The Other.  Even before Mr. Earnshaw dies and his eldest son Hindley (Lee Shaw) condemns Heathcliff to the stables, Heathcliff spends much of his time lurking around corners and peering through windows.  Much of the film is shot through small openings or vantages otherwise obstructed -- holes in the wall, doors left ajar, filthy windows, overgrown brush -- giving one the feeling of a voyeur, spying upon a world of which one is not a part.It is in fact an explicitly voyeuristic act perpetrated by Heathcliff and Catherine which will ultimately drive them apart.  Gawking through the windows of the nearby Linton estate, curious of how the other half lives, Heathcliff and Catherine are spotted by the Lintons who, startled, release their dogs upon them.  Catherine's foot is badly bitten, and the Lintons, realizing that she is just a girl, take her in to care for her.  Heathcliff, however, is sent away for his crude and vulgar demeanor, an attribute they claim of his having been an orphan from the streets of Liverpool.This interaction highlights what is perhaps Heathcliff's defining trait and greatest flaw: that of his priggish adherence to the label of The Other, which he wears as a foolish, spiteful, and wholly misguided point of pride.  This is where the issue of Heathcliff's race becomes pertinent, and it is worth reiterating the fact that the Lintons ascribe him the status of The Other based upon his actions and not his appearance.  Hindley, however, refers to Heathcliff as ""n----r"" several times throughout the film; to wit, even Catherine spits on Heathcliff when she first sees him.  As such, Heathcliff believes that as long as he is dark skinned, he will always be viewed as a savage, as unclean; he resists his baptism when he is first welcomed into Mr. Earnshaw's home, and even insists ""I like being dirty"" when it is suggested he bathe for company.  To Heathcliff, his own blackness is an irreversible stain on his character, making any attempts at gentility not only futile but a sign of weakness and of subservience.When Catherine marries Edgar Linton (James Northcote), Heathcliff -- at least in Arnold's telling of the story -- is maddened less by the loss of a potential lover than by the loss of compassion.  He views Catherine's acceptance of marriage as a concession to the hierarchical system of caste and manners of which he is an outsider and to which he professes no fealty.  Arnold even allows Catherine some concordant misgivings of her own; ""He's handsome, cheerful, and rich -- and he loves me,"" she asserts, before doubling back and confiding, ""Wherever souls live, I feel I'm wrong.""Heathcliff, rather than confronting Catherine, runs away.  When he returns several years later, he is in possession of some degree of wealth -- the source of which is undisclosed -- which he uses to secure room and board for a year in the Earnshaw house, during which time he will reinstate himself in Catherine's life.  This is, unfortunately, where Arnold starts to lose her grip on the story, and the final act doesn't quite gel.  Arnold is clearly trying to develop a conflict between Heathcliff's passion for Catherine and his vengeful greed, but she tilts the scales too much in favor of the latter to keep the audience emotionally invested.  Her Heathcliff simply has too few redeeming characteristics for us to want to see him succeed; he is selfish, insensitive, petulant, and manipulative.In fact, most of our sympathies end up with Isabella (Nichola Burley), Catherine's sister-in-law whose attraction to Heathcliff makes her an unfortunate pawn in his conquest for Catherine's affections.  Burley's may actually be the film's strongest performance; Isabella's is certainly the most fully realized emotional arc, even as it all unfolds within the film's final act.  It is through Heathcliff's treatment of her that we are able to more clearly understand his motives with Catherine.  The film ends by revisiting an earlier scene of Heathcliff and Catherine frolicking, in which Heathcliff eventually pins her down to the ground; what had earlier come across as playful now feels more like an act of dominance.  Heathcliff's steady gaze, which had originally seemed intimate and loving, now reads as self satisfaction, pleased at having found someone with whom he can reverse the roles of master and slave.Arnold deserves plaudits for intent -- I rather like this interpretation of Heathcliff, even if it does compromise the film's ability to engage the viewer -- and for technical execution.  Robbie Ryan, who has also worked on Arnold'sRed RoadandFish Tank (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray], deserves extra special mention for the film's poetic and evocative cinematography.  His unfussy compositions, smooth rack focuses across the vast moors, and control of atmosphere and light give the film a gravity that the script cannot.  I still admire Arnold's perspective and her control of mood, but ultimately Wuthering Heights suffers from the same lack of narrative momentum and thematic focus that, for me at least, crippled Arnold's previous film Fish Tank.  That film was, puzzlingly, almost universally adored for its stark depiction of the British lower class; Wuthering Heights at least has a little more to say, even if it struggles to get it all out.[originally published on Considering Film]",3,Regarding the Other,1363305600,"03 15, 2013",2013,8827,"['Andrea', 'Arnold', 'Heathcliff', 'sort', 'bastard', 'Not', 'sense', 'nothing', 'known',

1508880,AKS9SJTHTU0OM,B006328QWI,K. Gordon,"[0, 0]","Intelligent, controversial, challenging and edgy new version that is the correlative opposite of the famous 1939 classic version of Bronte's novel. Instead of Hollywood gloss and Shakespearian poetry, we get a dark, largely wordless, angry version of the story. One that uses images in the place of words to create it's rough-hewn poetry.This is a very sensual film, not in the sexual sense (although it has its smoldering moments) but in the way some films can make you feel a place as well as see it. The smell of the stables, the cold of the rain and wind, these seem to come palpably through the screen in Arnold's vision.Her boldest move is casting Heathcliff with a black actor (arguably much closer to Bronte's intent than the very white actors who have always seemed to play the role - in the book he's described as dark, possibly a gypsy, clearly a racial outsider). It brings new depths and meanings to Heathcliff's role as an outcast, new poignancy to his anger and hurt.It took me a while to lock into the film, perhaps because it so upended my conventional expectations. And I could see some just never feeling in sync with its odd, disturbed rhythms. But before long I was riveted. No longer was I watching &#34;a classic', but a living, breathing story of love, passion, class, race, and loss. Also, by casting young actors &#8211; as with Romeo and Juliet &#8211; the romantic intensity feels more understandable -- and probably more true to Bronte's time, when people married as teens, and rarely lived past 40.Ms. Arnold is one of the most exciting (if under known) young directors around, and she continues to fulfill her promise with this brave new version of a timeless tale.",5,"Clearly divides audiences, but I loved it",1397260800,"04 12, 2014",2014,1696,"['Intelligent', 'controversial', 'challenging', 'edgy', 'new', 'version', 'correlative', 'opposite', 'famous', '1939', 'classic', 'version', 'Bronte', 'novel', 'Instead', 'Hollywood', 'gloss', 'Shakespearian', 'poetry', 'get', 'dark', 'largely', 'wordless', 'angry', 'version', 'story', 'One', 'images', 'place', 'words', 'create', 'rough-hewn', 'poetry.This', 'very', 'sensual', 'film', 'not', 'sexual', 'sense', 'smoldering', 'moments', 'way', 'films', 'can', 'make', 'feel', 'place', 'as', 'well', 'see', 'smell', 'stables', 'cold', 'rain', 'wind', 'seem', 'come', 'palpably', 'screen', 'Arnold', 'vision.Her', 'boldest', 'move', 'casting', 'Heathcliff', 'black', 'actor', 'arguably', 'much', 'closer', 'Bronte', 'intent', 'very', 'white', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'always', 'seemed', 'play', 'role', 'book', 'described', 'dark', 'possibly', 'gypsy', 'clearly', 'racial', 'outsider', 'new', 'depths', 'meanings', 'Heathcliff', 'role', 'outcast', 'new', 'poignancy', 'anger', 'hurt.It', 'took', 'while', 'lock', 'film', 'perhaps', 'so', 'upended', 'conventional', 'expectations', 'could', 'see', 'just', 'never', 'feeling', 'sync', 'odd', 'disturbed', 'rhythms', 'long', 'was', 'riveted', 'No', 'longer', 'was', 'watching', '34', 'classic', 'living', 'breathing', 'story', 'love', 'passion', 'class', 'race', 'loss', 'Also', 'casting', 'young', 'actors', '8211', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', '8211', 'romantic', 'intensity', 'feels', 'more', 'understandable', 'probably', 'more', 'true', 'Bronte', 'time', 'when', 'people', 'married', 'teens', 'rarely', 'lived', 'past', '40.Ms', 'Arnold', 'one', 'most', 'exciting', 'known', 'young', 'directors', 'fulfill', 'promise', 'brave', 'new', 'version', 'timeless', 'tale']",Wuthering Heights 2011

1508882,A374CXEFOOX5DU,B006328QWI,M.C. Hewins,"[19, 25]","This production is a real mixed bag. It is beautifully inspired film-craft in regards to cinematography, location, direction and acting (especially from the younger actor and actress playing Heathcliff and Catherine).The director Andrea Arnold has lovingly understood and rendered Emily Bronte's masterpiece in a truer sense than I've ever seen previously in film adaptations. Her affinity with the novel is obvious in the extreme devotion to the nuances that other films always seem to miss. Specifically, and most importantly is location. Wuthering heights, Thrushcross Grange, and most especially the moors are such integral parts of this story and so representational that the importance of location cannot be over-estimated. Arnold's shots of the moors put the audience perfectly in the setting. Breathtaking images of the moors leave the viewer able to fully comprehend the isolation the characters would feel in such a desolate landscape. Which is then contrasted to the more populated and cheerful Thruscross Grange. Catherine and Heathcliff's bond is indigenous to the fierce and uncultivated land of the moors. Arnold's adaptation is unparalleled in expressing this deeper understanding of the story.She does a fine job with Catherine and Heathcliff's younger years. Solomon Glave and Shannon Beer gave heart-wrenching and profound performances, all the more remarkable given their tender ages. Glave's performance was remarkable. I believed in their love on screen, as surely as I did when I read the novel. However, the entire production goes belly up in the last third of film. The replacement of the characters with older actors betrays the powerful beauty and chemistry that was so painstakingly created by Beer and Glave. Kaya Scodelario and James Howson are both competent actors, but they did not earn the emotions they were pretending to as the younger actors had. Their appearance was too jarringly different. By the time they make it onscreen, Beer and Glave had already stole the show.Given that only three and half years pass in the novel between the time Catherine Marries Edgar and Heathcliff's return, the changeup of actors was even more senseless and inappropriate. But beyond this complaint, the rest of the story is wrapped up so quickly once the adult actors are brought in, that much of the story is missed. Heathcliff's revenge on Hindley, his reconstruction of his own trauma on Hareton, and his plot for Cathy and Linton are all forgotten about.This adaptation is superb in many ways, but fails in important aspects as well. I could not imagine watching this if I had not read the book. It would be incomprehensible and strange. Upon reflection as to why there has never been a generally accepted film adaptation for this story - I don't think it's possible. So much of the novel relies on narration. The narration of the ever boring Mr. Lockwood is a device for Nelly Dean to narrate the tale. It's Nelly Dean that makes the story human and digestible. She is not an unreliable narrator, but she is an incredibly biased narrator. In a sense, she raised Catherine and Heathcliff. Catherine and Heathcliff are detestable characters. They are selfish, narcissistic, and cruel. They are unlovable, yet Nelly loves them. Nelly forgives them. Nelly's narration softens and distills their harshness for the reader. However Nelly is never realized as a fully developed character in any of the film adaptations.This is a beautiful film with excellent cinematography. And while the directory clearly appreciates the story and captures real bits of the story with brilliance, she lets others important bits fall by the wayside, so that you have crystal clear snippets, but not the entire story in its full breathtaking splendor. What is captured is truer to the grisliest bits of the novel that are traditionally ignored in adaptations. It is a vindicating adaptation for anyone whose ever shaken their head in frustration when people romanticize Wuthering Heights or Heathcliff. This adaptation has glaring flaws and is difficult to digest, yet I'd recommend it to anyone else who is an avid fan of the novel, but not to newcomers and certainly not to people who enjoy standard period piece costume dramas.",4,Embracing the Thorn,1353024000,"11 16, 2012",2012,4232,"['production', 'real', 'mixed', 'bag', 'beautifully', 'inspired', 'film-craft', 'regards', 'cinematography', 'location', 'direction', 'acting', 'especially', 'younger', 'actor', 'actress', 'playing', 'Heathcliff', 'Catherine', '.The', 'director', 'Andrea', 'Arnold', 'lovingly', 'understood', 'rendered', 'Emily', 'Bronte', 'masterpiece', 'truer', 'sense', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'previously', 'film', 'adaptations', 'affinity', 'novel', 'obvious', 'extreme', 'devotion', 'nuances', 'other', 'films', 'always', 'seem', 'miss', 'Specifically', 'most', 'importantly', 'location', 'Wuthering', 'heights', 'Thrushcross', 'Grange', 'most', 'especially', 'moors', 'are', 'such', 'integral', 'parts', 'story', 'so', 'representational', 'importance', 'location', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'over-estimated', 'Arnold', 'shots', 'moors', 'put', 'audience', 'perfectly', 'setting', 'Breathtaking', 'images', 'moors', 'leave', 'viewer', 'able', 'fully', 'comprehend', 'isolation', 'characters', 'would', 'feel', 'such', 'desolate', 'landscape', 'Which', 'then', 'contrasted', 'more', 'populated', 'cheerful', 'Thruscross', 'Grange', 'Catherine', 'Heathcliff', 'bond', 'indigenous', 'fierce', 'uncultivated', 'land', 'moors', 'Arnold', 'adaptation', 'unparalleled', 'expressing', 'deeper', 'understanding', 'story.She', 'fine', 'job', 'Catherine', 'Heathcliff', 'younger', 'years', 'Solomon', 'Glave', 'Shannon', 'Beer', 'gave', 'heart-wrenching', 'profound', 'performances', 'more', 'remarkable', 'given', 'tender', 'ages', 'Glave', 'performance', 'was', 'remarkable', 'believed', 'love', 'screen', 'as', 'surely', 'did', 'when', 'read', 'novel', 'However', 'entire', 'production', 'belly', 'up', 'last', 'third', 'film', 'replacement', 'characters', 'older', 'actors', 'betrays', 'powerful', 'beauty', 'chemistry', 'was', 'so', 'painstakingly', 'created', 'Beer', 'Glave', 'Kaya', 'Scodelario', 'James', 'Howson', 'are', 'competent', 'actors', 'did', 'not', 'earn', 'emotions', 'were', 'pretending', 'younger', 'actors', 'had', 'appearance', 'was', 'too', 'jarringly', 'different', 'time', 'make', 'onscreen', 'Beer', 'Glave', 'had', 'already', 'stole', 'show.Given', 'only', 'three', 'half', 'years', 'pass', 'novel', 'time', 'Catherine', 'Marries', 'Edgar', 'Heathcliff', 'return', 'changeup', 'actors', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'senseless', 'inappropriate', 'complaint', 'rest', 'story', 'wrapped', 'up', 'so', 'quickly', 'adult', 'actors', 'are', 'brought', 'much', 'story', 'missed', 'Heathcliff', 'revenge', 'Hindley', 'reconstruction', 'own', 'trauma', 'Hareton', 'plot', 'Cathy', 'Linton', 'are', 'forgotten', 'about.This', 'adaptation', 'superb', 'many', 'ways', 'important', 'aspects', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'not', 'imagine', 'watching', 'had', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'would', 'be', 'incomprehensible', 'strange', 'Upon', 'reflection', 'why', 'never', 'been', 'generally', 'accepted', 'film', 'adaptation', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'possible', 'So', 'much', 'novel', 'relies', 'narration', 'narration', 'ever', 'boring', 'Mr.', 'Lockwood', 'device', 'Nelly', 'Dean', 'narrate', 'tale', 'Nelly', 'Dean', 'story', 'human', 'digestible', 'not', 'unreliable', 'narrator', 'incredibly', 'biased', 'narrator', 'sense', 'raised', 'Catherine', 'Heathcliff', 'Catherine', 'Heathcliff', 'are', 'detestable', 'characters', 'are', 'selfish', 'narcissistic', 'cruel', 'are', 'unlovable', 'yet', 'Nelly', 'Nelly', 'Nelly', 'narration', 'softens', 'distills', 'harshness', 'reader', 'However', 'Nelly', 'never', 'realized', 'fully', 'developed', 'character', 'film', 'adaptations.This', 'beautiful', 'film', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'directory', 'clearly', 'story', 'captures', 'real', 'bits', 'story', 'brilliance', 'others', 'important', 'bits', 'fall', 'wayside', 'have', 'crystal', 'clear', 'snippets', 'not', 'entire', 'story', 'full', 'breathtaking', 'splendor', 'What', 'captured', 'truer', 'grisliest', 'bits', 'novel', 'are', 'traditionally', 'ignored', 'adaptations', 'vindicating', 'adaptation', 'anyone', 'ever', 'shaken', 'head', 'frustration', 'when', 'people', 'romanticize', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'Heathcliff', 'adaptation', 'glaring', 'flaws', 'difficult', 'digest', 'yet', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', 'avid', 'fan', 'novel', 'not', 'newcomers', 'certainly', 'not', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'standard', 'period', 'piece', 'costume', 'dramas']",Wuthering Heights 2011

If you are going into this with that expectation, you are going to be sorely disappointed. It's actually a story about dysfunction and abuse. It's not beautiful. It's dark, brutal, and disturbing. There is nothing redeeming about it. The characters are not likable people. The story isn't a warm and happy one. The abuse is senseless and wicked.What makes it even worse is that it opens with this Blair Witch shaky cam that doesn't allow you to see the action. This continues throughout the ENTIRE FILM. Bizarre choice.Then you have the lack of dialog and music. The bulk of the film is silent. While I HATE dialog driven films (they feel like plays to me- which is a completely different animal), you do need SOME to know what is going on. The many long, silent shots do nothing to create deeper understanding, make you feel anything, or move the plot along. Then you get to the end when, finally, we hear some music. And what strange music it is. When music is done well, it is a supporting player to the scene. This just feels wrong.Another weird filming choice is the abundant use of extreme close ups and inserts of random images. The camera goes to boots, the mud, hair, a bug, a dead rabbit, the killing of a sheep, the moors... why? I get that one or two help to set the scene and but why bring the background to the foreground when it works very well where it is? And why do it over and over with the picture going in and out of focus?The story itself follows the book until it doesn't. When it stops, it goes wrong. The film maker spent so much time enjoying his ""artistry"" and setting the scene that there isn't time to finish the story properly so it stops midway through the book.The star of the movie is the moors. The actors are just okay. The story is weird and the film making is horrible. If you want to see snapshots of the moors, depression, and brutality, you will enjoy this.Oh, and if you are thinking of visiting England, watch this.
