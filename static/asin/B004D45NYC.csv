Her character is completely and energetically clueless with lots of screaming and hysteria whilst her family is trying to lull the Germans into thinking that England is at least partially pro-Germans so the iminent brutal war will be somewhat less brutal - this is also why the English housed German prisoners in beautiful old houses and served them afternoon tea in the drawing room every day so German spies could report back to the High Command that the English would be the best contacts for a possible ceasefire as once again, the German war machine sputtered out: Rudolf Hess.I wouldn't mind seeing this film again despite the creepy ending.

1396611,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004D45NYC,Grady Harp,"[48, 50]","Though there have been books and other films that deal with the dissidence between the aristocrats and the general populace of England around the topic of WW II, this beautifully executed 'historical thriller' brings many aspects of those discrepancies of opinion to light in a manner not unlike the similar thought processes in Germany at the same time: the gentry of Germany turned a blind eye to the events surrounding them (The Final Solution) in order to believe in what they chose to believe as a promise for stabilization and world importance as a genteel country.  Writer/Director Stephen Poliakoff has based his examination of this problem on focusing on the life of one particular character whose fate was the standard of the dispossessed.The year is 1939 and the aristocratic family of Sir Alexander Keyes (Bill Nighy) and his wife Maud (Jenny Agutter) are living what seems to be an idyllic life with their children Ralph (Eddie Redmayne), Celia (Juno Temple) and the eldest, Anne (Romula Garai) who we soon discover was adopted before the Keyes discovered they could bear children on their own.  Anne is a beautiful creative actress who seems to make the family proud.  The family is visited by an old friend Hector (David Tennant) who at dinner is very vocal about the fact that Hitler is a threat to England and that England must stop Hitler before he destroys them instead of pursuing a course of appeasement of Hitler that would prevent disturbance of their elegant way of life on the island of Britain.  It is obvious that Sir Alexander is more concerned with his duties as a member of parliament and his maintenance of his family history and wealth, and his responses to Hector as well as to the mysterious Balcombe (Jeremy Northam) from the Foreign Office and the young Lawrence (Charlie Cox), a new member of the Foreign Office who is courting Anne, suggest subterfuge.The family is visited by the very proper Aunt Elizabeth (Julie Christie) and while the entire family is on picnic, an infant transiently disappears while under Anne's care.  From this point the story takes a dark turn: Anne continues filming in London with her close friend, actor Gilbert (Hugh Bonneville), and Anne discovers some phonograph records in the basement of the Keyes home, records that contain not fox trots but instead 'conversations' from meetings.  Suspicions about evil derring-do arise when the family learns that Hector has committed suicide soon followed by the suicide of Gilbert and eventually the bizarre discovery of Lawrence's body among the pet animals ordered to be put to death to make the people of England more ready for abrupt changes.  War with Germany begins and changes the atmosphere and results in changes in the Keyes family: Anne is imprisoned by the family because 'she is really not one of us' and unravels the harrowing mystery of the Keyes' family involvement in the dark events of the present and the past.The mood of England of 1939 is beautifully captured by cinematographer Danny Cohen and the musical score by Adrian Johnston illustrates the dichotomy of the free-spirited Anne and the dark underpinnings of the Keyes family.  Romola Garai is excellent in her treacherous role as are the other stars.  Small roles by Toby Regbo, Christopher Lee, Corin Redgrave and others make this a cast rich in some of the finest British actors of the day.  GLORIOUS 39 ('Glorious' is the nickname given Anne) is an enlightening film that addresses many significant issues too infrequently addressed by works of history.

Scripted to the point that you wait for an actor to say some highly scripted, artificial line then the director says cut and edit then the next actor says their line and the director says cut again and edit. Thus we have no flow, no emotion, no humanness. Just stitched together improbabilities. Also called acting by line memorization - unemotional and unrealistic with poor to no character development.(2.) Extremely unrealistic character behavior in response to situations e.g. Anne is locked in a room and tries breaking out by banging on doors and window shutters with her hands when all she had to do was grab one of the iron lamps and bang away. The supposed suspense of who's the evil bad guys  was too predictable and not very suspenseful - been done many times before.(3.) Unrealistic, low budget, scenes like recently mown vast rolling fields with not a stitch of machinery or a single farm hand to be seen. Scenes taking place that are bizarre and unrealistic with no explanation e.g. people dying; military road blocks in the middle of nowhere.(4.) And, always a sign of a cheap not-well-thought-out production is a heavy reliance on borrowing props from some museum to create a cheap quicky period atmosphere.

I read the back-cover blurb, saw the familiar names of the cast members, got a whiff of the general subject matter and said to myself, ""Ah, just the thing!""I could not have been more wrong. What I found was a typically Hitchcockian story of charming, upper-class villainy directed by a man who clearly didn't have a clue as to what he was about and a cast of high-powered actors, all of whom were sleepwalking.Other reviewers here and on Amazon UK have accurately pointed out the lack of internal consistency and logic. The same charges can equally be laid against Hitchcock's works--but Hitchcock was a master of filmic magic and misdirection. This film's Poliakoff absolutely is not. Hitchcock, in storyboarding this film, would have used more than a few closeups to focus the drama directly on the heroine in what is at bottom a damsel-in-distress plot. Poliakoff, on the other hand, dotes on medium- and long-shots to inundate us in pretty views of candy-box-sweet landscapes. Hitchcock would have realized that the screenplay was full of pointless bloat and cut the running time by a good fifty percent. Poliakoff clearly doesn't appreciate that little problem. And finally, Hitchcock would have provided the film with a real ending rather than the dull thud we get here, which improbably manages to be simutaneously ultra-whispy and a kick in the viewer's teeth.There is just one reason to See this film: to hone your appreciation of Alfred Hitchcock's art.One grudgingly-given star.",1,A film desperately in need of Hitchcock,1322611200,"11 30, 2011",2011,1577,"['stumbled', 'thing', 'New', 'British', 'Shelf', 'nearby', 'video', 'rental', 'shop', 'read', 'back-cover', 'blurb', 'saw', 'familiar', 'names', 'cast', 'members', 'got', 'whiff', 'general', 'subject', 'matter', 'said', 'myself', 'Ah', 'just', 'thing', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'wrong', 'What', 'found', 'was', 'typically', 'Hitchcockian', 'story', 'charming', 'upper-class', 'villainy', 'directed', 'man', 'who', 'clearly', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'cast', 'high-powered', 'actors', 'whom', 'were', 'sleepwalking.Other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'Amazon', 'UK', 'have', 'accurately', 'pointed', 'out', 'lack', 'internal', 'consistency', 'logic', 'same', 'charges', 'can', 'equally', 'be', 'laid', 'Hitchcock', 'works', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'master', 'filmic', 'magic', 'misdirection', 'film', 'Poliakoff', 'absolutely', 'not', 'Hitchcock', 'storyboarding', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'few', 'closeups', 'focus', 'drama', 'directly', 'heroine', 'what', 'bottom', 'damsel-in-distress', 'plot', 'Poliakoff', 'other', 'hand', 'medium-', 'long-shots', 'inundate', 'pretty', 'views', 'candy-box-sweet', 'landscapes', 'Hitchcock', 'would', 'have', 'realized', 'screenplay', 'was', 'full', 'pointless', 'bloat', 'cut', 'running', 'time', 'good', 'fifty', 'percent', 'Poliakoff', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'little', 'problem', 'finally', 'Hitchcock', 'would', 'have', 'provided', 'film', 'real', 'ending', 'rather', 'dull', 'thud', 'get', 'here', 'improbably', 'be', 'simutaneously', 'ultra-whispy', 'kick', 'viewer', 'just', 'one', 'reason', 'See', 'film', 'hone', 'appreciation', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'art.One', 'grudgingly-given', 'star']",N/A

1396621,A1XT8AJB7S9JJG,B004D45NYC,Tony Heck,"[11, 13]","After finding secret pro-appeasment (for the Nazis) recordings Anne (Garai) becomes involved in a secret, violent conspiracy, set in England in 1939.  After one of her friends who speaks out against Hitler is found dead, Anne begins to dig deeper into the reasons for his death.  This is a very interesting movie.  It is both compelling and slow moving.  It is tense but it drags in spots. It kept me watching but my mind did wander a bit.  This is overall a good movie but you need to be in the mood for it.  You really feel for Anne and the way her life begins to fall apart.  I am a fan of historical movies so I really liked that aspect of it.  This movie had the feel of a made-for-TV movie, although it would have been an HBO movie with the quality of it.  I recommend this but again, it's not for everyone, and you need to be in the mood to watch a movie like this one.  I give it a B-.Would I watch again? - Probably not",3,An interesting movie set in pre-war England about appeasing Hitler. Slow but will keep you entertained and watching.

Having just been tortured this weekend with movies that were far worse, I have to say that I frankly enjoyed this thriller of pre-WWII English life. The political climate and thoughts pro and con from aristocrat to the average Englishman varied widely to my surprise. I didn't realize that many of the aristocracy were against the war and had reacted in such violent means in order to avoid war to save their own way of life - no matter what horrors others in Europe were facing at the same time from Hitler. As the movie progressed, I didn't know who to believe or not believe as one by one individuals were killed.  The movie, for me, at least kept up the suspense, though I hate to watch my darling Jeremy Northam play a rather despicable man. Word of warning, if you're an animal lover, stay away. Disturbing images. The slaughter of pets after the declaration of war was frankly appalling.  I found it very difficult to watch, especially when one's lover is found hanging from a hook upside down in a barn with other carcasses waiting to be burned.  In any event, the movie kept my interest and kept me guessing.  In spite of its merits, it's not quite worth a five star rating.",3,Surprised Suspense,1332633600,"03 25, 2012",2012,1260,"['First', 'must', 'say', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'negative', 'comments', 'movie', 'Having', 'just', 'been', 'tortured', 'weekend', 'movies', 'were', 'far', 'worse', 'have', 'say', 'frankly', 'enjoyed', 'thriller', 'pre-WWII', 'English', 'life', 'political', 'climate', 'thoughts', 'pro', 'con', 'aristocrat', 'average', 'Englishman', 'varied', 'widely', 'surprise', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'many', 'aristocracy', 'were', 'war', 'had', 'reacted', 'such', 'violent', 'means', 'order', 'avoid', 'war', 'save', 'own', 'way', 'life', 'matter', 'what', 'others', 'Europe', 'were', 'facing', 'same', 'time', 'Hitler', 'movie', 'progressed', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'believe', 'not', 'believe', 'one', 'one', 'individuals', 'were', 'killed', 'movie', 'least', 'kept', 'up', 'suspense', 'hate', 'watch', 'darling', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'play', 'rather', 'despicable', 'man', 'Word', 'warning', ""'re"", 'animal', 'lover', 'stay', 'away', 'Disturbing', 'images', 'slaughter', 'pets', 'declaration', 'war', 'was', 'frankly', 'appalling', 'found', 'very', 'difficult', 'watch', 'especially', 'when', 'one', 'lover', 'found', 'hanging', 'hook', 'upside', 'down', 'barn', 'other', 'carcasses', 'waiting', 'be', 'burned', 'event', 'movie', 'kept', 'interest', 'kept', 'guessing', 'spite', 'merits', 'not', 'quite', 'five', 'star', 'rating']",N/A
