Since that was not the case you kept hoping for something redeeming or different. Not gonna happen. So this just isn't really worth your time.

However, Jay Mohr is kind of an odd fit for the lead role of Kevin. He seems out of place as an actor and has a less than serious demeanor. The in-laws aren't particularly lovable themselves and initially treat Kevin so horribly that it almost makes his attitude justifiable.

He is invited to his in-laws' home for a Christmas celebration and drags his feet the whole way.  He, of course, wants to see his son, but he is not really thrilled about family time with the ex, her family and her new boyfriend.  Of course Kevin's son is thrilled to have the family together and doesn't care about anything other than that and wishes that it was Christmas every day.In the fame of &#34;Groundhog Day,&#34; Christmas repeats itself again and again with only Kevin realizing what is going on.  Kevin is not remotely delighted to spend the same day again and again with his ex and her family and acts out like the selfish man he is.  But a change may come if he is willing to open his heart and his eyes.&#34;Christmas Do-Over&#34; is a sweet Christmas film.  There is a lesson to be learned which makes it nice for the family.  Don't dig too deep though because there are a lot of things that would make you dismiss the magic of the sweet spot of this story.

Once a year, I throw good taste aside and  eagerly await the holiday TV movie season. I tune in for (almost) every mindless, formulaic Hallmark, Lifetime and ION made-for-TV movie released. (No small feat, as it seems like there is about 40 of them a year.) They are undeniably cheesy, laughably acted (always starring whatever third-billed former sitcom star is currently most in need of a paycheck), ridiculously formulaic and always cheaply produced ... And I love them. Yes, some are nearly unwatchable dreck, but some are terrible in a much better, much sweeter, far more festive way.In this oh-so-specific genre, CHRISTMAS DO-OVER is one of my all time favorites. Yes, it's rip-off of the undeniably superior in every single wayGroundhog Day  [Blu-ray]. But, I mean, c'mon, it's a made for TV Christmas film--there are only about four plots for all these movies and they make 20-30 a year. (We play a game where you say the title of a new made-for-TV Christmas movie and guess the plot based solely on the title; you'd be amazed how accurate you can get after seeing only a handful of examples.)So, yes, this is even far from the only do-the-day-over Xmas rip off either, but it is the best one, in my opinion.  But, for all it's cheesy Christmas goodness, it's also funny, sweet and will put you squarely in the holiday spirit ... Which is kind of the point.No real need to buy the DVD, though it's far from a big expense, as they show this, and every other Christmas film, annually. But if you're looking to find one of the better examples from this much-maligned, and yet also beloved, genre, CHRISTMAS DO-OVER is one of the best.",4,"Cheesy, Christmas Fun",1382832000,"10 27, 2013",2013,1762,"['usually', 'have', 'fairly', 'discerning', 'taste', 'movies', 'television', 'am', 'reason', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'junkie', 'Once', 'year', 'throw', 'good', 'taste', 'aside', 'eagerly', 'await', 'holiday', 'TV', 'movie', 'season', 'tune', 'almost', 'mindless', 'formulaic', 'Hallmark', 'Lifetime', 'ION', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'released', 'No', 'small', 'feat', '40', 'year', 'are', 'undeniably', 'cheesy', 'laughably', 'acted', 'always', 'starring', 'whatever', 'third-billed', 'former', 'sitcom', 'star', 'currently', 'most', 'need', 'paycheck', 'ridiculously', 'formulaic', 'always', 'cheaply', 'produced', 'love', 'Yes', 'are', 'nearly', 'unwatchable', 'dreck', 'are', 'terrible', 'much', 'better', 'much', 'sweeter', 'far', 'more', 'festive', 'way.In', 'oh-so-specific', 'genre', 'CHRISTMAS', 'DO-OVER', 'one', 'time', 'favorites', 'Yes', 'rip-off', 'undeniably', 'superior', 'single', 'wayGroundhog', 'Day', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'mean', ""c'mon"", 'made', 'TV', 'Christmas', 'film', 'are', 'only', 'four', 'plots', 'movies', 'make', '20-30', 'year', 'play', 'game', 'where', 'say', 'title', 'new', 'made-for-TV', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'guess', 'plot', 'based', 'solely', 'title', ""'d"", 'be', 'amazed', 'how', 'accurate', 'can', 'get', 'seeing', 'only', 'handful', 'examples', 'So', 'yes', 'even', 'far', 'only', 'do-the-day-over', 'Xmas', 'rip', 'best', 'one', 'opinion', 'cheesy', 'Christmas', 'goodness', 'also', 'funny', 'sweet', 'will', 'put', 'squarely', 'holiday', 'spirit', 'Which', 'kind', 'point.No', 'real', 'need', 'buy', 'DVD', 'far', 'big', 'expense', 'show', 'other', 'Christmas', 'film', 'annually', ""'re"", 'looking', 'find', 'one', 'better', 'examples', 'much-maligned', 'yet', 'also', 'beloved', 'genre', 'CHRISTMAS', 'DO-OVER', 'one', 'best']",N/A
