989134,A9TG2NFA614S9,B000FFJZOW,John F. Rooney,"[3, 4]","George Carlin is one of my favorite stand-up comedians--certainly in the top four--and I own all of his DVDs. ""Jammin' in New York"" (1991) is not one of his best. It's not as funny because George is angrier in this one, raving and bloviating -- a curmudgeon who has veered too far off his own track. There's less profanity and fewer of his down and dirty jokes. He's anti-everything in this outing. If you're a golfer, don't even go near this one because George wants to turn all of the thousands of golf courses into places to build homes for the homeless. Golf to him is an inane, elitist sport.A funny stream is his riff on airline trips, and he is very sharp targeting those announcements that drive you nuts. When he goes off a long rant about the indestructibility of Planet Earth toward the end of his performance, you sense that the comedian has surrendered to contentiousness, and you can hear him losing his audience. His harangues get tiresome. There are thin lines between satire, comedy, and polemics, and in this one he's lost that delicate balance.His delivery and inventiveness (he's a perceptive, shrewd dude) are, as usual, great. This one isn't as political as some.What to look for is his take on how aggressive the U.S. is, how willing to wage war against non-whites. This DVD focuses on the Gulf War. Local drinking water and the first George Bush are also subjects for discussion. Not a great DVD but a lot better than many of the efforts of other comics.",4,"Not at His Best, Still Very Good",1250812800,"08 21, 2009",2009,1478,"['George', 'Carlin', 'one', 'favorite', 'stand-up', 'comedians', 'certainly', 'top', 'four', 'own', 'DVDs', 'Jammin', 'New', 'York', '1991', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'not', 'funny', 'George', 'angrier', 'one', 'raving', 'bloviating', 'curmudgeon', 'who', 'veered', 'too', 'far', 'own', 'track', 'less', 'profanity', 'fewer', 'down', 'dirty', 'jokes', 'anti-everything', 'outing', ""'re"", 'golfer', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'go', 'one', 'George', 'turn', 'thousands', 'golf', 'courses', 'places', 'build', 'homes', 'homeless', 'Golf', 'inane', 'elitist', 'sport.A', 'funny', 'stream', 'riff', 'airline', 'trips', 'very', 'sharp', 'targeting', 'announcements', 'drive', 'nuts', 'When', 'long', 'rant', 'indestructibility', 'Planet', 'Earth', 'end', 'performance', 'sense', 'comedian', 'surrendered', 'contentiousness', 'can', 'hear', 'losing', 'audience', 'harangues', 'get', 'tiresome', 'are', 'thin', 'lines', 'satire', 'comedy', 'polemics', 'one', 'lost', 'delicate', 'balance.His', 'delivery', 'inventiveness', 'perceptive', 'shrewd', 'dude', 'are', 'usual', 'great', 'one', ""n't"", 'as', 'political', 'some.What', 'look', 'take', 'how', 'aggressive', 'U.S.', 'how', 'willing', 'wage', 'war', 'non-whites', 'DVD', 'Gulf', 'War', 'Local', 'drinking', 'water', 'first', 'George', 'Bush', 'are', 'also', 'subjects', 'discussion', 'Not', 'great', 'DVD', 'lot', 'better', 'many', 'efforts', 'other', 'comics']",N/A
