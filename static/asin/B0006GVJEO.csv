867615,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0006GVJEO,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 4]","Sayles had a very interesting film on his hands with Silver City, however it somehow became very muddied as it progressed from beginning to end.  Chris Cooper did an exceptional job embodying the essence of his character, a Dubya of sorts, but he wasn't nearly given enough screen time.  Instead, we find ourselves on a rampage with a character that felt less personal, less developed, and overall too confusing.  The path that this Danny Huston leads us on inevitably becomes the downfall of the film.  Too many characters are introduced to us in such a short time.  These characters randomly were involved with the progression of the plot, which became too convoluted with each passing minute.  Sayles knew what he was creating, I just feel as if it wasn't being translated well to the silver screen.Sayles is a master of his trade.  His films continue to inspire and evoke thought even if they are not commercial successes.  The trouble with Silver City is that I think he found himself going too deep with not enough money or time to explain it all.  At the beginning of the film, I had an idea of what was happening, but as more and more characters were introduced, as more and more plot twists tried to occur I lost the sense of the film by the ending.  While the ending was very clever and very dark, I needed more explanation.  I think some of the reason that I lost my train of thought with this film was due to the casting of Danny Huston as our guide.  He was pathetic.  I didn't seem him as very exciting person to lead us on this adventure.  He seemed to go through the motions, but not really accomplish much at all.  This was the first downfall of Sayles' important film.While I will admit that the characters played by Richard Dreyfuss, Miguel Ferrer, James Gammon, and Daryl Hannah were interesting, I just needed a better guide to help me understand their roles in this political scandal.  Danny Huston just did not cut it for me.  Outside of the characters, Sayles needed a stronger script.  I sometimes felt that unless I was deeply rooted in the political world, some of the references were well over my head.  The entire reasoning for Silver City to be built and the corruption behind it eluded me.  I am a simpleton that loves advanced films, but this one just didn't make much sense to me.  There were several times that I found myself asking, ""Why"" instead of seeing the whole picture.  I felt as if the individual stories were as clear as glass, yet the whole picture was dusty and murky at the same time.  Sayles needed to concentrate more on the bigger picture instead of these smaller issues, which ultimately fogged this film.Perhaps I went into this film with the wrong idea.  I was expecting to see another version of Primary Colors, but instead witnessed something less heartfelt and more technical.  Without giving the ending away, I thought that the final scene was one of the most beautiful moments in political cinema history.  The brilliant symbolism has stayed in my mind for the past two days after watching this film, while the rest of the movie quickly shuffled away from my mind.  Maybe a second viewing would do better for me, but for some odd reason Silver City just didn't click with me.  There seemed to be too many loopholes that were never explained or accounted for.  An ensemble piece is always good with me, but when the characters are introduced without explanation, it just looses steam.  This was one of those rare occasions.Overall, I was very upset with this film.  Being very Democrat, I wanted to see a side of politics that I wasn't aware of and another side that would make you chuckle.  I wanted to be engulfed with the world of corporate money and the dufus' that are elected.  I wanted intelligent humor framed by the words of George W., but instead all I found was a very confusing story aimed at a certain audience of which I will never be a part.  Sad, this picture had so much wasted promise.Grade: ** out of *****",2,"Murky, Confusing tale of Political Secrets.",1106524800,"01 24, 2005",2005,3982,"['Sayles', 'had', 'very', 'interesting', 'film', 'hands', 'Silver', 'City', 'however', 'somehow', 'became', 'very', 'muddied', 'progressed', 'beginning', 'end', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'did', 'exceptional', 'job', 'embodying', 'essence', 'character', 'Dubya', 'sorts', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'given', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'Instead', 'find', 'rampage', 'character', 'felt', 'less', 'personal', 'less', 'developed', 'overall', 'too', 'confusing', 'path', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'inevitably', 'downfall', 'film', 'Too', 'many', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'short', 'time', 'characters', 'randomly', 'were', 'involved', 'progression', 'plot', 'became', 'too', 'convoluted', 'passing', 'minute', 'Sayles', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'creating', 'just', 'feel', 'was', ""n't"", 'being', 'translated', 'well', 'silver', 'master', 'trade', 'films', 'continue', 'inspire', 'evoke', 'thought', 'even', 'are', 'not', 'commercial', 'successes', 'trouble', 'Silver', 'City', 'think', 'found', 'going', 'too', 'deep', 'not', 'enough', 'money', 'time', 'explain', 'beginning', 'film', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'more', 'more', 'characters', 'were', 'introduced', 'more', 'more', 'plot', 'twists', 'tried', 'occur', 'lost', 'sense', 'film', 'ending', 'ending', 'was', 'very', 'clever', 'very', 'dark', 'needed', 'more', 'explanation', 'think', 'reason', 'lost', 'train', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'due', 'casting', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'guide', 'was', 'pathetic', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'very', 'exciting', 'person', 'lead', 'adventure', 'seemed', 'go', 'motions', 'not', 'really', 'accomplish', 'much', 'was', 'first', 'downfall', 'Sayles', 'important', 'film.While', 'will', 'admit', 'characters', 'played', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'Miguel', 'Ferrer', 'James', 'Gammon', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'were', 'interesting', 'just', 'needed', 'better', 'guide', 'help', 'understand', 'roles', 'political', 'scandal', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'cut', 'characters', 'Sayles', 'needed', 'stronger', 'script', 'sometimes', 'felt', 'was', 'deeply', 'rooted', 'political', 'world', 'references', 'were', 'well', 'head', 'entire', 'reasoning', 'Silver', 'City', 'be', 'built', 'corruption', 'eluded', 'am', 'simpleton', 'advanced', 'films', 'one', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'were', 'several', 'times', 'found', 'asking', 'Why', 'instead', 'seeing', 'whole', 'picture', 'felt', 'individual', 'stories', 'were', 'as', 'clear', 'glass', 'yet', 'whole', 'picture', 'was', 'dusty', 'murky', 'same', 'time', 'Sayles', 'needed', 'concentrate', 'more', 'bigger', 'picture', 'instead', 'smaller', 'issues', 'ultimately', 'fogged', 'film.Perhaps', 'went', 'film', 'wrong', 'idea', 'was', 'expecting', 'see', 'version', 'Primary', 'Colors', 'instead', 'witnessed', 'something', 'heartfelt', 'more', 'technical', 'giving', 'ending', 'away', 'thought', 'final', 'scene', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'moments', 'political', 'cinema', 'history', 'brilliant', 'symbolism', 'stayed', 'mind', 'past', 'two', 'days', 'watching', 'film', 'rest', 'movie', 'quickly', 'shuffled', 'away', 'mind', 'Maybe', 'second', 'viewing', 'would', 'do', 'better', 'odd', 'reason', 'Silver', 'City', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'click', 'seemed', 'be', 'too', 'many', 'loopholes', 'were', 'never', 'explained', 'accounted', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'always', 'good', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'explanation', 'just', 'steam', 'was', 'one', 'rare', 'occasions.Overall', 'was', 'very', 'upset', 'film', 'Being', 'very', 'Democrat', 'wanted', 'see', 'side', 'politics', 'was', ""n't"", 'aware', 'side', 'would', 'make', 'chuckle', 'wanted', 'be', 'engulfed', 'world', 'corporate', 'money', 'dufus', 'are', 'elected', 'wanted', 'intelligent', 'humor', 'framed', 'words', 'George', 'W.', 'instead', 'found', 'was', 'very', 'confusing', 'story', 'aimed', 'certain', 'audience', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'part', 'Sad', 'picture', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'wasted', 'promise.Grade', '**', '*****']",N/A

While shooting a campaign ad, the candidate uncovers a dead body and an investigation begins.Unfortunately the tantalizing premise fails to deliver as the movie shifts its focus to a journalist working (a bland Danny Huston) on the story as it follows him on a convoluted path that takes him to Pilager's wayward black sheep sister (a hilariously menacing Daryl Hannah) and others tied in various ways to the campaign and its less that virtuous games while crossing paths with an old flame (a forgettable Maria Bello).""Silver City"" is not without its moments, particularly in some sharp performances by many in the cast, but unfortunately the normally astute Sayles seems to try to coast on the stellar cast and begins to lose control of the material about a third of the way through the film.

While Moore's film was a frontal assault on the George W. Bush administration, Sayles' film was less a jab at Right Wing politics, although it clearly was, and more an assault on the sliminess of politics in general. I was surprised at how good the film was, considering all the negative reviews it got from critics. Is it a great film, in league with Sayles' best? No. But it's light years beyond typical Hollywood fare- especially bigger budgeted films like the Clinton era's Wag The Dog.The film it most resembles is Roman Polanski's Chinatown, although set in contemporary Colorado, and this film having a lighter feel- in terms of the cinematography and humor.... t's a shame that this film was swamped by so many other screechy films, such as Fahrenheit 911 and Mel Gibson's The Passion Of The Christ, for it deserved it, despite its bad ending.

Sometimes there are real winners and sometimes losers. It's sorta like video Russian Roulette. Last night I viewed a loser. It was an awful movie. A lost evening. The DVD was ""Silver City"" and I picked it because it had an election theme spread all over the cover and this is, in fact, an election year.I'm left not knowing exactly what Silver City was all about. Elections and politics dominated the early going and I was just getting used to the characters and their roles, not an easy task. Then, at one of the photo opportunities, the movie turned into a murder mystery and stayed that way until the case was solved. What? Oh, I could mention that there were all sorts of twists and turns and little side excursions which went no where. Hard to follow? You betcha. Sub plots that lead nowhere. Relationships that lead nowhere. You name it. A lot of the movie just didn't make sense at all, at least to me. Rambling and incoherent might be a good brief review. The acting wasn't bad, not bad at all. The filming was excellent and I enjoyed viewing my home state of Colorado. The movie had a very large cast with some prominent names.

In SILVER CITY he continues his dissection of America's tarnished underbelly and with his usual techniques of large cast and long screenplay he gives us almost more than we can digest in one film.Not that each of his avenues of story doesn't have merit (clearly not the case! - they do).  But with so many agendas to examine through the eyes of such an enormous (and excellent) cast, some of the laser-like punches of his points become blunted.  The story is relatively straight forward in the beginning:  the simpleton, nerdy, inarticulate fool Dickie Pilager (Chris Cooper at his finest) is being processed as a candidate for Governor of Colorado by his campaign manager Chuck Raven (Richard Dreyfuss) and among the endless grammatical and textual faux pas is an accidental filming of Dickie trying to speak to the endangered environment while snagging the body of an illegal immigrant from one of the lakes in the mountains of Colorado.  The smarmy way Raven attempts to hide this hideous discovery includes manipulating the press, the police, and the public all in order to have his grossly incompetent candidate continue in a good light.  The discovered body unravels a chain of events that uncovers the corruption in every aspect of the town - and metaphorically in our country!Sayles shines his wise light on the plight of illegal immigrant issues, the gross mismanagement of environmental protection (read destruction), the demise of journalism credibility, the greed of land developers, the stench of the wealthy, AND a not too occult parody of George W. Bush!The large and generally fine cast (in addition to Cooper and Dreyfuss) includes the skills of Daryl Hannah, Tim Roth, Thora Birch, Maria Bello, Billy Zane, Danny Huston, Mary Kaye Place, Kris Kristofferson, and Miguel Ferrer.  While the movie wanders along in excess of two hours and feels like the hand of an editor would be welcome, what Sayles has to say and warn us about is very much worth seeing.  One leaves this movie with the feeling that a bit more time in  the postproduction room would have brought this important film into a tighter and more pungent arena.

867623,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B0006GVJEO,Joe Sherry,"[2, 3]","All I knew of ""Silver City"" is that it was the John Sayles movie where Chris Cooper does a killer impersonation of W. He does. But that's not really what the movie is about. Dickie Pilager (get it?) is running for Governor of Colorado. He's a fairly slow talking, dim-witted, easily confused and easily led caricature of President Bush. While shooting a promotional campaign commercial where Pilager is fishing in a river, Dickie manages to hook a corpse instead. Dickie's Karl Rove like manager Chuck Raven (Richard Dreyfuss) gets to work to protect his candidate and also to find out who did this. He believes that there are forces out to get Dickie and to sabotage his campaign. Raven gets a detective agency to work to find out who is behind it and also to let certain individuals know that ""They are being watched.""Danny O'Brien (Danny Huston) is the investigator put on the case and ""Silver City"" is really seen through his eyes as he investigates. We learn, as he does, about the legacy of the Pilager family, their corruption and ties to some big business, and how the power of this family was built on illegal labor, dishonesty, and a poor record towards the environment.While sometimes interesting and amusing (in particular, Cooper's Dickie Pilager just kills), ""Silver City"" isn't that great of a movie overall.

Well, ...Actually, Cooper's role in SILVER CITY is relatively minor as he plays Dickie Pilager, the dufus son of Colorado's senior senator running for that state's governorship. The film initially captures interest as Dickie snags a corpse with his fishing lure during a photo op at a mountain lake. The candidates handler, Chuck Raven (Richard Dreyfuss), immediately suspects his man is being set-up and hires private eye Danny O'Brien (Danny Huston) to investigate the opposition. From here on, the film slides into a boring and cynical visual rant against the unholy alliance of right-wing politicians, environmental polluters, corrupt land developers, and coyotes that smuggle illegal  - i.e. ""undocumented"" according to the Politically Correct - migrant workers for the benefit of Big Agrabusiness. One suspects that writer/director/editor John Sayles is drawing a parallel between the senior Pilager and son Dickie and George Bush, Sr. and Dubya.  Ok, fine. Whatever.  But even the tenuous thread of a murder mystery - who killed the guy in the lake - can't make this movie interesting, especially as it grinds on for over two excruciating hours.There is perhaps only one performance worth watching, that of the free-spirited and sexually liberated Madeleine Pilager (Daryl Hannah), Dickie's black sheep sister, who wields a mean bow and arrow and can expertly shaft campaign pictures of her detested sibling.My biggest problem with SILVER CITY was that the various characters, with the possible exception of Madeleine, were unappealing and unengaging, and, though the mechanism by which the bod got into the water is eventually revealed, it portends nothing more than a whole lot of dead fish. Nobody is brought to justice, if indeed there was ever much of a crime to begin with. And if the viewer is left with a heightened perception of political (read ""Republican"") banality and venality, so what? After 55 years in these United States and the world in general, those are attributes I can ascribe to politicians of any and every stripe.I watched SILVER CITY over my microwaved dinner hoping to be entertained at the end of a typically uninspiring 9 to 5 workday - and wasn't.

867625,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0006GVJEO,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 9]","When I first saw the trailer for ""Silver City"" I assumed it was going to be a political satire that was out to savage George W. Bush.  After all, the trailer shows us Dickie Pilager (Chris Cooper), a (1) conservative candidate from a (2) political family running for (3) governor in (4) the western state of Colorado whose political ideology is revealed in (5) torturous sentences that make no sense.  There are five points of commonality between Dickie and the current occupant of the White House.  The fact that John Sayles (""City of Hope"") wrote and directed this 2004 film also seemed like a hint, and if you watch the ""Making of"" featurette on this DVD he comes out and says that ""Silver City"" is a response to what Bush has done as president.  But since Dickie Pilager becomes a relatively minor character in this film, you cannot really say that Bush is only target.  Then again, Dickie's campaign manager is named Chuck Raven (Richard Dreyfuss), and that is within easy nudge-nudge wink-wink territory of Karl Rove, so maybe we just need to cast the net of Sayle's disdain a bit wider.I watched the trailer for ""Silver City"" as soon as I finished watching this DVD because I was thinking that I had been the victim of some sort of bizarre bait and switch.  But there is the bit from the beginning where Dickie hooks a dead body in a Colorado lake while filming a political ad, and the character of Danny O'Brien (Danny Huston) is featured prominently as the person investigating the murder.  So it is my fault that I got all excited about Dickie Pilager being a political joke when the movie wants to go in another direction.  The problem is that where the movie wants to go is rather convoluted and ultimately unsatisfying, especially if you already knew that politicals was a cesspool and that if a candidates lips are moving it is safest to assume they are lying.What happens in ""Silver City"" is not so much a plot as it is a chain of relationships.  O'Brien is the private eye investigating the case who used to be dating Nora Allardyce (Maria Bello), a reporter.  She thinks there is a connection between the floating corpse and the election campaign.  Nora is engaged to Chandler Tyson (Billy Zane), a lobbyist, who appears to know where the bodies are buried.  Meanwhile, O'Brien hooks up with Madeleine Pilager (Daryl Hannah), Dickie's sister, whose illegitimate child derailed her Olypmic skating career.  She would love to get sink her brother's campaign, which is being kept afloat by Wes Benteen (Kris Kristofferson), who apparently owns all the mines in Colorado and since he already has a Pilager in his pocked as a U.S. Senator (Michael Murphy), just needs that one's son as governor to cover the other half of his rear end.Also running around in this film are James Gammon, Tim Roth, Mary Kay Place, David Clennon, Miguel Ferrer, Alfre Woodard, and Thora Birch, so there is no doubting Sayles' ability to assemble an ensemble cast.  It is just that are of the piece and parts of ""Silver City"" end up constituting a whimper rather than a bang.  Obviously my heightened expectations are coming into play here, because I was expecting a scathing political satire and what Sayles hath wrought is more of a sad acknowledgement of the way the world works.  At one point a character allows that people have lost their ability to be scandalized, and that is probably as good an explanation as any as to why Sayles appears to be pulling his punches.  However, my disappointment at the end result causes me to round down on this one.  Fortunately this movie clearly clicks with some people and hopefully it will for you, but I am not to be counted in their number.",3,Wait a minute.

Unfortunately, this overtly political murder mystery isn't up to Sayles' usually high standards. Dicky Pilager (Chris Cooper) is a dim-witted son of a Senator who is running for Governor in the state of Colorado. While filming a television spot to promote his dubious concern for the environment, Dicky hooks a corpse on a fishing line. His paranoid campaign manager, Chuck Raven (Richard Dreyfuss), hires private investigator Danny O'Brien (Danny Huston) to find out if the corpse was planted by the Pilagers' enemies. Danny, who was a journalist until he fell victim to his own somewhat naive idealism, pokes into the Pilager family's fortunes, tracks down enemies and supporters, and tries to identify the dead man. He is too dedicated an investigator for his own good, though, and gets himself into much the same straits that ended his journalism career.""Silver City"" has John Sayle's trademark superior character writing and great ensemble cast. It gets off to a promising start, but the film is too long, the murder investigation tedious, and the pace is plodding. In case you don't know, Sayles' politics are left of center. ""Silver City"" lampoons President George W. Bush with Chris Cooper's Dicky Pilager, who ""seems a lot more gubernatorial with the sound off"". Kris Kristofferson plays Wes Benteen, a developer who wants to bulldoze national parks and the villainous brains behind the malleable Dicky: ""Silver City"" condemns relaxed environmental regulation, privatization of public lands, and heavy financing of political campaigns by private industry. Whether you agree with the film's politics or not, its story is weak and convoluted. And ""Silver City""'s socio-political criticisms would have been been more effective approached with a commonsense style instead of a clearly left-wing perspective. On the bright side are Chris Cooper and Danny Huston's performances.The DVD: Bonus features include a making-of documentary and an audio commentary by director John Sayles and producer Maggie Renzi. ""The Making of Silver City"" (35 minutes) is a poorly organized documentary in 7 parts. John Sayles and Maggie Renzi discuss the film's politics plainly, the cast talk about their characters, and we meet some of the crew. The audio commentary is about the technical aspects of filming, with little or no mention of the film's themes, and is really pretty good.

Some parts of the story could have and should have been left out for time purposes.The main jist of the film is this: Dicky Pilager is the son of Senator Judson Pilager and is running for Governor of Colorado. On a campaign video shoot by a lake, he reels in the body of a dead man, and his campaign manager immediately begins damage control. He hires Danny, an ex-political newspaper writer to investigate the body and any possible links to Pilager enemies.Through his investigation, Danny learns that the people that hired him to investigate Pilager enemies and their link to the body, actually have nothing to do with it., indicating something worse. Danny learns of illegal immigrants which lead him to an abandon mine shaft belonging to Wes Benteen (the money behind the Pilagers), which also happens to be where two of the immigrants tried to burry the body of the man who died in an accident at a slaughter house owned by Benteen. If you are following, Benteen's businesses include the mine shaft, a football team, agricultrue and a slaughter house, most of it manned by illegal aliens.The body found in the lake was from an illegal alien working in the slaughter house for Benteen when he slipped and fell to his death due to unsafe working conditions. His buddies hid him in the mine shaft until they could burry him, except that the mine shaft got flooded and the body washed down to the lake where Pilager later did the video shoot.When Danny goes to investigate the mine shaft, he slips and falls into the river and finds barrels of toxic waste in the water, which are hidden from the public. In the end, it is assumed that Pilager will win and as he's giving a speech, dead fish begin to pop up to the surface of the lake.Chris Cooper plays Dicky Pilager as an artifical politican being run by his father's old campaign machine.

I have to agree w/ the critics that the detective/journalist main character could have been much stronger, more believable and certainly more likable. But hey, this is a satirical movie for entertainment, not a documentary. It wasn't made as a vehicle for Oscar nomination, but to encourage the viewer to wake up and pay attention to the world outside of oneself, and just maybe to start caring enough about American politics to get involved. Sure it takes digs at GW and the GOP prior to the presidential election, but none are out of line (although by now who hasn't heard it before?). I took it for what is, enjoyed the great cast demonstrate their movie magic skills.

I wish it could have had more of Chris Cooper (who seems to act very much like Bush) and Richard Dryfuss (who seems awfully Cheney like). The movie wasn't as funny as the previews made it look and actually turns up to be a pretty good murder mystery full of oddball characters. It kind of reminded me of Primary Colors, with John Travolta, which was a mimic of Clinton and his skeletons in the closest. The movie never seems to step up and be true political satire or a full fledge murder mystery. It is somewhere in between, which actually reflects politics in today's world. Overall, it is an interesting movie and worth watching. It is very very slow at times, and I didn't really care for Danny Huston's character.",3,"Silver City isn't a silver or gold medal, but a bronze",1106870400,"01 28, 2005",2005,766,"['Silver', 'City', 'good', 'movie', 'little', 'slow', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'who', 'act', 'very', 'much', 'Bush', 'Richard', 'Dryfuss', 'who', 'awfully', 'Cheney', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'funny', 'previews', 'made', 'look', 'actually', 'up', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'murder', 'mystery', 'full', 'oddball', 'characters', 'kind', 'reminded', 'Primary', 'Colors', 'John', 'Travolta', 'was', 'mimic', 'Clinton', 'skeletons', 'closest', 'movie', 'never', 'step', 'up', 'be', 'true', 'political', 'satire', 'full', 'fledge', 'murder', 'mystery', 'somewhere', 'actually', 'politics', 'today', 'world', 'Overall', 'interesting', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'very', 'very', 'slow', 'times', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'character']",N/A

I think the main problem is that John Sayles cares too much about the subject matter and loses the aesthetic distance it requires to make an enjoyable movie.  I totally share his political concerns and only wish that this could have succeeded.  He piles horrific offense on top of horrific offense and I got bogged down.  The romantic encounters of the star, Danny Huston, with Darryl Hannah and Maria Bello, relieved the dreariness and made the film more watchable, at least for me.The cast is excellent, and as others have mentioned, Chris Cooper does a pretty humorous version of the man we all love to hate, although I actually think he overdid it a little.  I always enjoy Kris Kristofferson and would have liked to have seen more of him as the arch villain.It's a film worth seeing, for the importance of the message.

It had just enough laughs--and mystery--to keep me interested.Others have gone over the plot. Chris Cooper plays quite a good dimwit--actually no less articulate than the dimwit who now occupies the formidable house on Pennsylvania Avenue.I disagree with those critics who say Richard Dreyfus's character, the dimwit's campaign manager, is not slimy enough. I thought he did a good job as a Rove-like snake, of no integrity whatsoever. In fact, in the ""making of"" bonus feature, Dreyfus says what I've been saying since I was a teenager (and I'm almost Dreyfus's age!): People essentially don't care [about much of what's going on] until they're affected by it. And then it's too late. Thanks for confirming my assertion of the last nearly 40 years, Richard!Frankly, at first I thought Michael Murphy was too young to play Dicky Pilager's dad, but, when I saw it a few more times, he did all right.I had a slight problem with the sherrif, Skaggs I think the character was called. He was apparently the one responsible for the lead character, Danny O'Brien, played by Danny Huston, getting fired in the first place. But by the end, the guy bordered on being Danny's political advisor.  There was nothing Danny could do, so, the sherrif advised him, he'll have to reconcile himself to what's happened.But I can live with that as the consequence of a lower-budget story.Overall, I'm glad I have it. Sayles says in one of the special features that we are a story-telling species. That's obvious, from oral tradition of religious scripture to tales told by vikings which became epics. Those stories are important. I'll use this story it at the ""salons"" some friends plan to have. It's a great caricature of what we face with the neocons running the show so far.
