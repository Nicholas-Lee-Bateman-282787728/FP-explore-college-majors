986267,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,B000F9UEK2,Edwin C. Pauzer,"[18, 21]","This DVD catalogues the rise of Tom Delay from Texas backbencher to US Congressional power broker to his indictment and downfall.What makes Delay so special or infamous is his reform of congress for the worse. He parceled out money for votes, demanded that lobbying firms contribute money and hire republicans before he would even entertain their interests. (Some would call this bribery or conflict of interest. In our congress it's called business as usual.) He held votes open long after the normal voting period, and brought bills to the floor for vote without legislators even having a chance to read them.He ""gerrymandered"" Texas redistricting in a deliberate attempt to gain republican seats in congress. He managed to pull this off despite Texas legislators fleeing across the Oklahoma border so that a quorem could not be mustered. The hammer lost that round but eventually muscled his way to victory, and got more republicans elected.Delay's undoing was his insistence on corporate sponsorship (money) to his political action committee called Trmpac. This was patently illegal in a state that already has weak campaign laws. His reaction was to mount a campaign against the prosecutor that was unsuccessful. Finally, Delay resigns in disgrace and vows to help republicans win. His only hope was the people of Texas would re-elect a republican to his old seat. Even in this, Texans had apparently had enough of his shenanigans and elected a democrat.This story may interest those fascinated with Delay, or for those who know very little about him. But it is clear that this is a low-budget production. A couple of times my attention wondered, and I found myself pressing the back button.It is worth a look, and you can always resell it.

986268,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B000F9UEK2,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","Some political analyst has commented that we are no longer a Democracy but a Plutocracy. This documentary goes a long way in proving that.Here's the scoop. Tom DeLay went from being political wallpaper in the early part of his career to being an influence peddler. He did so by illegal means which included money laundering. The Texas Lt. Governor ordered an investigation and sent DeLay and some of his minions to court and proved the case.You'll want to take a shower after viewing this little gem. This skewers DeLay on essentially two avenues. First is his wanting to get more Republicans in the Senate. He did so by getting oodles of dollars from private business to dump into the campaigns of Republican candidates. Since he couldn't do it directly he sent the donated bucks to GOP Washington which turned around and sent the same dollars back as though it came from them, hence the money laundering. Then it deals with DeLay's re-redistricting of Texas to, once again, favor the Republicans and no where near give the tax payers fair representation.This is a very methodical presentation. It lays out what the Texas Lt. Governor thinks was happening, then moves on into the subsequent investigation, indictment and trial. It interviews politicians, journalists and some ordinary folk, and there is no doubt the allegations are true. DeLay is a scumbag. There is a significant amount of drama here. The Lt Governor knew this was no cake walk. He had to prove some mighty heinous allegations but, in the end, he was correct. There's little, if anything, new here in the format. What is cool is seeing the scumbag DeLay not own up to what he did. He, and all the others involved, feel persecuted. Boo-freakin'-hoo. I also like that Texas has a law disallowing corporations from contributing dollars to political campaigns. Also is the fact that, with the myriad scum issuing from Texas (I'm from Illinois so I know scum when I see it) over the decades, this documentary is loaded with some of the more upstanding people I've ever seen. Both on the government side as well as in the privet sector, these are people who seem as concerned about the state of things as I am.This is a must see for anyone concerned about the state of our union.",4,We're Being Sold Down the River,1375142400,"07 30, 2013",2013,2243,"['political', 'analyst', 'commented', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'Democracy', 'Plutocracy', 'documentary', 'long', 'way', 'proving', 'scoop', 'Tom', 'DeLay', 'went', 'being', 'political', 'wallpaper', 'early', 'part', 'career', 'being', 'influence', 'peddler', 'did', 'so', 'illegal', 'means', 'included', 'money', 'laundering', 'Texas', 'Lt', 'Governor', 'ordered', 'investigation', 'sent', 'DeLay', 'minions', 'court', 'proved', 'case.You', ""'ll"", 'want', 'take', 'shower', 'viewing', 'little', 'gem', 'skewers', 'DeLay', 'essentially', 'two', 'avenues', 'First', 'wanting', 'get', 'more', 'Republicans', 'Senate', 'did', 'so', 'getting', 'oodles', 'dollars', 'private', 'business', 'dump', 'campaigns', 'Republican', 'candidates', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'directly', 'sent', 'donated', 'bucks', 'GOP', 'Washington', 'turned', 'sent', 'same', 'dollars', 'back', 'came', 'hence', 'money', 'laundering', 'Then', 'DeLay', 're-redistricting', 'Texas', 'once', 'again', 'favor', 'Republicans', 'where', 'near', 'give', 'tax', 'payers', 'fair', 'representation.This', 'very', 'methodical', 'presentation', 'out', 'what', 'Texas', 'Lt', 'Governor', 'was', 'happening', 'then', 'subsequent', 'investigation', 'indictment', 'trial', 'politicians', 'journalists', 'ordinary', 'folk', 'doubt', 'allegations', 'are', 'true', 'DeLay', 'scumbag', 'significant', 'amount', 'drama', 'here', 'Lt', 'Governor', 'knew', 'was', 'cake', 'walk', 'had', 'prove', 'mighty', 'heinous', 'allegations', 'end', 'was', 'correct', 'little', 'anything', 'new', 'here', 'format', 'What', 'cool', 'seeing', 'scumbag', 'DeLay', 'not', 'own', 'up', 'what', 'did', 'others', 'involved', 'feel', 'persecuted', ""Boo-freakin'-hoo"", 'also', 'like', 'Texas', 'law', 'disallowing', 'corporations', 'contributing', 'dollars', 'political', 'campaigns', 'Also', 'fact', 'myriad', 'scum', 'issuing', 'Texas', ""'m"", 'Illinois', 'know', 'scum', 'when', 'see', 'decades', 'documentary', 'loaded', 'more', 'upstanding', 'people', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'government', 'side', 'as', 'well', 'privet', 'sector', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'seem', 'concerned', 'state', 'things', 'am.This', 'must', 'see', 'anyone', 'concerned', 'state', 'union']",The Big Buy - Tom Delay's Stolen Congress
986269,A2YLX1IY5FGAZX,B000F9UEK2,Erin Campbell,"[13, 14]","""The Big Buy"" may not have the slick gloss of other documentaries, but the content is invaluable in understanding how American democracy has been hijacked.  Birnbaum and Schermbeck show how Tom DeLay deliberately reengineered the electoral system to create an incestuous alliance of lobbyists and government officials on a scale not seen before in American politics.  This culture of corruption demands business representatives pay thousands of dollars for access to politicians -- akin to practices normally associated with self-serving Third World governments.  In the meantime, the interests of average Americans are shunted aside.  The documentary cautions that, even though DeLay has had to step down, others of his ilk have replaced him  and are carrying on his legacy.Another outstanding source revealing the magnitude of corruption that has taken hold is PBS's Bill Moyers on America.  The first episode, ""Capitol Crimes,"" connects the dots regarding Jack Abramoff, Tom DeLay, Grover Norquist and others who brought an agenda to D.C. to buy out Congress with a view to creating a permanent Republican Congress whose power derives from monies given to it by big business.One definition of Fascism is a government aligned in partnership with corporate businesses.  ""The Big Buy"" shows how Tom DeLay has created that model for American in the 21st century.

I don't understand why, given all the trouble it must be to arrange and film all these interviews, it was considered too much trouble to provide just a little bit of back-story narration up front, or some narration during the documentary to tell me what's going on, or some text on slides to mark section breaks, or something to keep this from turning into one big long stream-of-conscienceness firehose of interview clips that were supposed to be telling me something.Yes, there is a direction.  We start with interview clips telling about Tom DeLay's early years in Texas politics back in the 1980's, and we end up with DeLay resigning, but it's a long and tedious journey from here to there; kind of the film equivalent of driving on a highway through Texas, without even any signs to tell you that you're in Texas.Anyway, I didn't have any feelings about Tom DeLay going into this, and I must admit I learned something, but can documentary makers please get back to making geniune documentaries again?
