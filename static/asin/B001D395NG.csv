Outside of that, it is a quite entertaining show. The dancing is top notch ... when these girls break unison its a rare shock ... they are spot on. The singing is on key and enjoyable. There are some nice numbers for younger children to enjoy, great dancing for Moms to enjoy, and (ahem) plenty of legs for Dads to enjoy. ;-)I'm not sure this would top my list of ""must see"" Christmas entertainment every year, but it was certainly an entertaining diversion, and I'm sure that watching it live in the theater would have been a great experience. I had the opportunity to see the Rockettes live on one of my long ago visits to NYC, and its a show I still remember fondly.I probably wouldn't be moved to buy a DVD of this show, but its certainly worth the price of a rental if you don't have Prime, and its a no-brainer for Prime members to take advantage of its availability.",4,Review of the streaming video,1324512000,"12 22, 2011",2011,1074,"['watched', 'mainly', 'time', 'filler', 'recently', 'was', 'free', 'watch', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'membership.The', 'quality', 'streaming', 'video', 'not', 'very', 'sharp', 'thus', 'reason', 'docked', 'point', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'show', 'dancing', 'top', 'notch', 'when', 'girls', 'break', 'unison', 'rare', 'shock', 'are', 'spot', 'singing', 'key', 'enjoyable', 'are', 'nice', 'numbers', 'younger', 'children', 'enjoy', 'great', 'dancing', 'Moms', 'enjoy', 'ahem', 'plenty', 'legs', 'Dads', 'enjoy', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'top', 'list', 'must', 'see', 'Christmas', 'entertainment', 'year', 'was', 'certainly', 'entertaining', 'diversion', ""'m"", 'sure', 'watching', 'live', 'theater', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'experience', 'had', 'opportunity', 'see', 'Rockettes', 'live', 'one', 'long', 'ago', 'visits', 'NYC', 'show', 'still', 'remember', 'fondly.I', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'moved', 'buy', 'DVD', 'show', 'certainly', 'price', 'rental', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Prime', 'no-brainer', 'Prime', 'members', 'take', 'advantage', 'availability']",Radio City Christmas Spectacular

I tried to watch this film and was going nuts trying to SEE what was going on! It was edited in the rat-a-tat style you expect for the trailer of a Bruce Willis ""Die Hard"" film. It's as if the director was so afraid the show was boring, he (she?) felt it necessary to cut to a new shot, or a close up, or a zoom, or a dolly shot as frequently as possible. At first, I thought this was just for the introduction, that things would slow down. Nope. It never slowed down. And the audience shots; billions of them. This has become standard in filming live performances of everything, now, other than concerts by the Berlin Philharmonic!  Yes, it's a great show, I just wish the camerawork didn't get in the way of seeing it.

Along came this DVD...I've ordered several copies of this show to send to people this year in lieu of holiday cards.  I usually look at a holiday card for about 30 seconds.

So, I'll keep this review brief, adding yet another 5 STARS and sharing some photos in CUSTOMER IMAGES.After 75 years, The Rockettes' signature eye high kicks and precision choreography is now like a well oiled machine.  Sometimes you have to remind yourself that this is a real performance, by real people - not computer-generated imagery!I enjoyed watching everyone's favorite - the Christmas toy soldier come to life in  'Parade of the Wooden Soldier'.  My favorite part is when Wooden Soldiers 'fell down' like dominoes after the 'cannon' shot the word 'BANG' taking them down!  'Parade of the Wooden Soldier' is the Rockettes in perfect harmony!  Truly awesome!The more somber 'Let Christmas Shine' is indeed a 'heartfelt message of hope and love' by The Rockettes.  Dressed in silver and flesh colored outfits, they looked really smart!The Rockettes' whirlwind tour on a double-decker bus 'visiting' Manhattan, Times Square and Central Park is a nicely done dance routine creating the essence of Christmas in 'The Big Apple'.  The Rockettes end their 'tour' with their signature kicks singing 'It's Christmas Time Again In New York City' - the girls in smart white costumes trimmed with red and green looked tastefully gorgeous!My favorite on this DVD is 'The Twelve Days of Christmas' by Santa.  This 75th Anniversary Diamond Celebration is a must for your Holiday DVD Collection!The Rockettes are an iconic part of Christmas.  This DVD would make a great 'Stocking Stuffer' - buy this 75th Anniversary DVD in lieu of Christmas Cards this holidays!RUNNING TIME: 80 minutesAUDIO: 2.0 StereoVIDEO: WidescreenNOTE TO TIME WARNER INC:  I must admit, the video quality of this 2007 DVD is quite good.

I couldn't believe that I wasn't able to get this DVD to fill up my TV screen.  Since my Blu Ray player is relatively new, the first thing I thought was that there was an adjustment that I was not aware of and went to Best Buy to ask for help.  When the doubting salesperson put the disc on the in-store system, we were both amazed that it was,indeed, produced in a 4x3 matted version, leaving a good deal of black around all four edges.  I then went to the store that I bought it in and asked if there was a problem in the first pressing.  The sales person gave me a totally blank stare and said that no one had complained.  My next step was to call the phone number listed on the back cover.  The Time-Life rep who took the call was very polite and offered me a replacement DVD but didn't really know what I was talking about since, ""There have been no complaints"". I then went back to Barnes and Nobel and exchanged the disc for one from a new shippment that had come in.  Of course, the new disc was exactly the same.  The DVD is produced in high def. and looks simply spectacular! It is utterly amazing that the moron who was ultimately responsible for the end product could have produced it in a way that doesn't take full advantage of its possibilities!
