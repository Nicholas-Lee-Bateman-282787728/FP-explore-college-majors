You can master it very easily, and the optional use of wrist weights adds intensity and toning to  your arms while doing great aerobics.  What also makes this a great tape is  the excellent stretching, especially at the end.  They are very helpful and  relaxing.  Jane makes this video very well, which is great to do if you  can't do a half hour of high impact aerobics like in her other earlier  tapes.

I read all the reviews of this workout before I bought a copy and most of the reviews were favorable.  This is a steady low impact workout with very little stress to the joints.  The video requires optional equipment of wrist weights. I have to say this video had some corny aspects to it, in particular the ""new guy"".  The video could have done without that it was kind of silly.  Other than that the guy did not bother me to much. This not one of my favorite workouts it is an okay workout.  I like to use it as a warmup to one of my other Jane Fonda Workout tapes like workout with weights, complete workout, new workout or easy going workout.  I have to say if I were going to truly reccomend a low impact video that is still a challenge I would recommend the complete workout.  The music and chreography is better plus you have the option of really pushing yourself.",4,low impact workout for those who need light workout,1123459200,"08 8, 2005",2005,1015,"['workout', 'eight', 'minute', 'warmup', '35', 'minute', 'low', 'impact', 'aerobic', 'workout', 'additional', 'ten', 'minute', 'cool', 'down', 'read', 'reviews', 'workout', 'bought', 'copy', 'most', 'reviews', 'were', 'favorable', 'steady', 'low', 'impact', 'workout', 'very', 'little', 'stress', 'joints', 'video', 'optional', 'equipment', 'wrist', 'weights', 'have', 'say', 'video', 'had', 'corny', 'aspects', 'particular', 'new', 'guy', 'video', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'was', 'kind', 'silly', 'Other', 'guy', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'much', 'not', 'one', 'favorite', 'workouts', 'okay', 'workout', 'like', 'use', 'warmup', 'one', 'other', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'Workout', 'tapes', 'workout', 'weights', 'complete', 'workout', 'new', 'workout', 'easy', 'going', 'workout', 'have', 'say', 'were', 'going', 'truly', 'reccomend', 'low', 'impact', 'video', 'still', 'challenge', 'would', 'recommend', 'complete', 'workout', 'music', 'chreography', 'better', 'have', 'option', 'really', 'pushing']",N/A

I  don't find the whoops and hollers distracting. Yes, it is dated, but I've  yet to find a new routine that is truly low impact so I use it every week  to give my joints a rest while still getting in the workout I need. Despite  using it weekly for years, I'm still not bored with it. Because of the way  the routine was choreographed, I can always find some way to challenge  myself - picking knees up higher, kicking higher, bigger arm movements,  using more floor space, etc. You can add wrist weights as you improve your  fitness to get your heart rate up higher - just be careful with the arm  movements if you do. You must place your arms where you want them rather  than throwing them around or run the risk of injuring yourself. A great  routine!",5,"Truly low impact, not like others than claim to be &amp; aren't",968889600,"09 14, 2000",2000,903,"['need', 'aerobic', 'dance', 'routine', 'bouncing', 'one', 'foot', 'floor', 'times', 'still', 'good', 'workout', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'whoops', 'hollers', 'distracting', 'Yes', 'dated', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'find', 'new', 'routine', 'truly', 'low', 'impact', 'so', 'use', 'week', 'give', 'joints', 'rest', 'still', 'getting', 'workout', 'need', 'using', 'weekly', 'years', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'bored', 'way', 'routine', 'was', 'choreographed', 'can', 'always', 'find', 'way', 'challenge', 'picking', 'higher', 'kicking', 'higher', 'bigger', 'arm', 'movements', 'using', 'more', 'floor', 'space', 'etc', 'can', 'add', 'wrist', 'weights', 'improve', 'fitness', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'higher', 'just', 'be', 'careful', 'arm', 'movements', 'do', 'must', 'place', 'arms', 'where', 'want', 'rather', 'throwing', 'around', 'run', 'risk', 'injuring', 'great', 'routine']",N/A
