Because it focuses on three very different returning GIs than was depicted in that film. The three men, Guy Madison Robert Mitchum and Bill Williams are portrayed as the type ofworking class men who did come home from the war. As opposed to men in Best Years. Who were (with the exception one) more upper middle  class. Such men had a more difficult time re-adjusting than others.Plus the story was more focused than the other film. which jumped about from one GI to the other, without giving a fuller picture of each.It also didn't hurt the film to have the ""VERY"" Hunky Guy Madison in the lead role either!

In this one Robert Mitchum comes home with a plate in his head and too much pride to go to the hospital to get help; Bill Williams is minus his legs and feels he's useless; and Guy Madison is perfectly okay physically, just restless and unsure what he wants. He falls for widowed Dorothy McGuire, and the main plot concerns them. But the treatment of the men and their problems of fitting in is well handled - intelligent and sympathetic. Only the last 10 minutes threatens to sink the picture and all the good that came before: it's pure Hollywood corn (and includes a barroom brawl), which is a real shame.

248884,A2HIWDD2TDXS19,6301278518,F. Gentile,"[17, 23]","This movie is so forgotten that I'm the first person to review it! A nostalgic appreciation will definately contribute to your possible enjoyment of this film. This story of three returning World War 2  G.I.'s, and their readjustment into society, is much less celebrated than the similar themed ""The Best Years Of Our Lives"", even though this film was released before that Oscar winner. It's what you might call a ""B"" version of the celebrated ""Lives."" This was a very early vehicle for Robert Mitchum, and he effectively displays the tough-guy delivery and fledgling screen persona for which he later became well known. Dorothy McGuire is fine also as the troubled war widow/ love interest of Guy Madison. This film was  my first look at Mr. Madison, whom I vaguely recall from his later ""Wild Bill Hickock"" television series. Though he was not at all what you'd call a great actor, in fact, he was self-consciously wooden in delivery, I must admit I was impressed by his screen sexuality, which oddly transcends the films time period of the 1940's. He was almost impossibly beautiful, not remotely feminine, yet totally unlike other male actors of that time, and sported a ""look"" that would fit in any Abercrombie & Fitch catalogue of today. This film has very palpable sexual undertones (at least I felt 'em!) There are times when the camera languishingly lingers (can something languishingly linger??) on Madisons bare torso, as he lies in repose on the bed, as if he were Jane Russell, with an unheard of for that time intensity, which really makes me wonder if this is what the director intended. I doubt that possibility, given the oppressiveness of the times and the storyline. However, there are several such scenes, with exchanged glances, so heavy in unintentional homo-erotic suggestiveness that they are now campily hysterical. So, I would recommend this film primarily as more of a curiosity piece, with its ""war movie"" appeal coming in a contradictary second. This is probably not the best reason to suggest watching a film, but the fact that Guy Madison, who is not exactly a household name,  was quite possibly one of the handsomest men ever in film would be my major reason for suggesting this tale, where the story line comes in a distant second to all that beefcake in uniform.

248886,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,6301278518,Only-A-Child,"[0, 0]","Whereas ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" (1946) gave a Norman Rockwell picture of returning WWII veterans trying to reintegrate themselves into civilian life, RKO's  ""Till the End Of Time"" (released four months earlier) was more concerned with confronting that subject head-on than idealizing it.  Which ultimately makes it a better film if a less popular one with an escape seeking public who already had their fair share of trauma.Years later the television series ""China Beach"" would feature an episode (Fever) that was a worthy homage to this film.  In that episode Nurse McMurphy comes home to Kansas where: "" she goes to work as ward nurse at the local hospital while trying to make peace with her increasingly neurotic mother who does not approve of her fast, stressful lifestyle and bitterly tries to cling onto the past"".  I was reminded of that episode while watching Cliff Harper (Guy Madison) trying to deal with his mother.  Particularly a scene where her mother throws McMurphy's fatigue uniforms away and a panicked McMurphy frantically rushes to the curb to retrieve them from the garbage can.The point being that both mothers want the family to resume their lives from the point they were at before the war.  And while a part of each veteran wants this same thing, another part of them realizes that it is impossible; so they end up marking time for a period until they can get things sorted out internally.  Their readjustment process is one of reconciling the desire to have things as they once were with the desire (need) to hang on to the changes or growth they have undergone.  Director Edward Dmytryk symbolically dispels the notion that Cliff can ever pick up his life from where he left off, he does this through an early scene where Cliff discovers that his old civilian clothes are far too small for him.  Although played for laughs this scene conveys more than just the physical changes to Cliff during the three years he was been a Marine.""Till the End of Time"" nicely illustrates this dynamic with the two new women in Cliff's life.  Fresh-faced Helen Ingersoll (Jean Porter - Hollywood's all-time cutest actress) is a perfect fit for the pre-war Cliff; the type of girl he would be pursuing if things could magically go back to the way they were.  But the high mileage Pat Ruscomb (Dorothy McGuire) is a far better fit for what Cliff has become.  Cliff's attraction dynamic with these two females says in a nutshell everything the film is trying to illustrate. Thankfully Williams and McGuire have an effortless chemistry that helps them sell both their mutual attraction and their reluctance to move forward and let go of cherished parts of the past.The plot summary is a bit misleading, saying ""three"" marines have a hard time readjusting to civilian life and giving Robert Mitchum and Bill Williams (soon to be television's Kit Carson) equal billing with Madison and McGuire; as if there are three equally weighted parallel stories (insert ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" here).  The story centers on Cliff Harper, there are only a few brief scenes that do not feature Madison.  So fans of ""Surfside Six"" will get a full dose of their favorite star.My favorite scene is the one where Porter and Williams ""cut a rug"" to the sounds of the jukebox in the old soda joint.The most nostalgic scene was shot at the old Iceland skating palace.  It looks like Porter does her own skating while someone doubles for McGuire.  Unfortunately they did not go on location for the beach scene,  and the projected beach background requires considerable suspension of disbelief.Then again, what do I know?
