All of the characters from the 1999 film &#34;The Best Man,&#34;  are present and each character  has a time to shine in the movie.  Terence Howard is very funny and his character shows the most growth from the 1999 original.  Monica Calhoun is outstanding as the ill Mother of three children and wife to Morris Chestnut.  Several of the characters are going through trials, most of all Taye Diggs character and Sanaa Lathan and Julian (Murch) and wife, Regina Hall.  The movie ends on a positive note but there is truly a very sad part towards the end. There is plenty of cattiness and backbiting between the women and the men and it brings a clarity to their personalities and backgrounds.  Sanaa Lathan who was not in the first movie as much has a much more pivotal role in this one.It took 14 years for the Director Malcolm D. Lee to make this sequel but I must say that it was well worth the wait and the actors have grown as stars.  What a great ensemble cast.  The music in the movie also wonderful.  I really enjoyed this movie and it is one that I would watch again and again.  A sequel as good as the original.  How amazing!Watch this movie, recommend it to others and watch it with friends and be prepared to laugh a lot and also to cry.  Try not to hold back the tears let them flow.  Then watch it again.

1637230,A2QCCOYU3SA105,B00BPEJZEM,"Deborah Chapman ""Deborah Chapman""","[0, 0]","The Best Man Holiday movie writer and director Malcolm D. Lee (Spike Lee's cousin) waited 14 years to do a sequel to The Best Man, 1999 of an outrageously fresh comedy of African-American love and backbiting film displaying wit, verve, spark, and surprise. The Best Man Holiday extends portraying character stories and filling in blanks left in the original, The Best Man. Malcolm D. Lee raises the stakes on characters cradling to their bosoms, adding a surprising amount of tragedy with a richer emotional palette. The Best Man Holiday sequel to The Best Man ensues Malcolm D. Lee is a better motion picture writer than well-known Tyler Perry.The Best Man Holiday stars somewhat black ensemble cast, made with talented and likeable actors such as Taye Diggs, Morris Chestnut, Terrence Howard, Harold Perrineau, Nia Long, Regina Hall, and Sanaa Lathan, Melissa De Sousa, Monica Calhoun, Eddie Cibrian and among others. Lance Sullivan (Morris Chestnut) is now looking toward retirement, while Harper Stewart (Taye Diggs) is getting the boot from his professorship and a flat pan from his publishers in response to his latest manuscript. On top of this, Robyn (Sanaa Lathan), Harper's wife, is eight months pregnant, giving Harper reason to keep her in the dark about his troubles. I enjoyed the goofy rendition of New Edition's ""Can You Stand the Rain?"" of its fun by treating the cheesy lyrics with a certain measure of sincerity. The scant laughs come courtesy of hedonistic Quentin (Terrence Howard) and Julian Murch (Harold Perrineau), who's dealing with a scandalous online video featuring his wife, Candace (Regina Hall). As with the first film, the men indulge an off-putting jealousy in regard to women's sexual histories that Malcolm D. Lee plainly justifies as naturally masculine, and women on the whole here hardly matter outside of the men they're connected to. Even man-eater Shelby (Melissa De Soussa) is defined by her relationships with Julian (Harold Perrineau), her ex, and Quentin (Terrence Howard), her booty call; Jordan (Nia Long), a powerful businesswoman, is only noticeable for stirring up jealousy over Harper (Taye Diggs) and waiting for her new boyfriend, Brian (Eddie Cibrian) to forgive her. This was a great movie and I hope the next sequel does not take as long as 14 years later because t the end of this film Quentin (Terrence Howard) announced he was getting married.",5,The Best Man Holiday Is An Awe-Inspiring Film,1392422400,"02 15, 2014",2014,2403,"['Best', 'Man', 'Holiday', 'movie', 'writer', 'director', 'Malcolm', 'D.', 'Lee', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'cousin', 'waited', '14', 'years', 'do', 'sequel', 'Best', 'Man', '1999', 'outrageously', 'fresh', 'comedy', 'African-American', 'love', 'backbiting', 'film', 'displaying', 'wit', 'verve', 'spark', 'surprise', 'Best', 'Man', 'Holiday', 'portraying', 'character', 'stories', 'filling', 'blanks', 'left', 'original', 'Best', 'Man', 'Malcolm', 'D.', 'Lee', 'stakes', 'characters', 'cradling', 'bosoms', 'adding', 'surprising', 'amount', 'tragedy', 'richer', 'emotional', 'palette', 'Best', 'Man', 'Holiday', 'Best', 'Man', 'Malcolm', 'D.', 'Lee', 'better', 'motion', 'picture', 'writer', 'well-known', 'Tyler', 'Perry.The', 'Best', 'Man', 'Holiday', 'somewhat', 'black', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'made', 'talented', 'likeable', 'actors', 'such', 'Taye', 'Diggs', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'Harold', 'Perrineau', 'Nia', 'Long', 'Regina', 'Hall', 'Sanaa', 'Lathan', 'Melissa', 'De', 'Sousa', 'Monica', 'Calhoun', 'Eddie', 'Cibrian', 'others', 'Lance', 'Sullivan', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'now', 'looking', 'retirement', 'Harper', 'Stewart', 'Taye', 'Diggs', 'getting', 'boot', 'professorship', 'flat', 'pan', 'publishers', 'response', 'latest', 'manuscript', 'top', 'Robyn', 'Sanaa', 'Lathan', 'Harper', 'wife', 'eight', 'months', 'pregnant', 'giving', 'Harper', 'reason', 'keep', 'dark', 'troubles', 'enjoyed', 'goofy', 'rendition', 'New', 'Edition', 'Can', 'Stand', 'Rain', 'fun', 'treating', 'cheesy', 'lyrics', 'certain', 'measure', 'sincerity', 'scant', 'come', 'courtesy', 'hedonistic', 'Quentin', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'Julian', 'Murch', 'Harold', 'Perrineau', 'who', 'dealing', 'scandalous', 'online', 'video', 'featuring', 'wife', 'Candace', 'Regina', 'Hall', 'first', 'film', 'men', 'indulge', 'off-putting', 'jealousy', 'regard', 'women', 'sexual', 'histories', 'Malcolm', 'D.', 'Lee', 'plainly', 'naturally', 'masculine', 'women', 'whole', 'here', 'hardly', 'matter', 'men', ""'re"", 'connected', 'Even', 'man-eater', 'Shelby', 'Melissa', 'De', 'Soussa', 'defined', 'relationships', 'Julian', 'Harold', 'Perrineau', 'ex', 'Quentin', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'booty', 'call', 'Jordan', 'Nia', 'Long', 'powerful', 'businesswoman', 'only', 'noticeable', 'stirring', 'up', 'jealousy', 'Harper', 'Taye', 'Diggs', 'waiting', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'Brian', 'Eddie', 'Cibrian', 'forgive', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'hope', 'next', 'sequel', 'not', 'take', 'as', 'long', '14', 'years', 'later', 't', 'end', 'film', 'Quentin', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'announced', 'was', 'getting', 'married']",The Best Man Holiday

1637248,A10H47FMW8NHII,B00BPEJZEM,"Jay B. Lane ""professional audience member""","[20, 24]","So this fellow had written a fictitious book inspired by events in his own life... When the old group gathered for a wedding, friends questioned how much of that book was really fiction and how much was actual fact. Oops! That was the premise of &#34;The Best Man&#34; in 1999. Now we have a sequel which takes place 15 years later. And yes, the plot has thickened ...but those old hurts still haven't gone away.Our little bunch has never been so witty or so appealing; the dialogue is racy, raunchy and very, very funny (the delighted audience laughed out loud over and over again). Religion unabashedly plays a big part in the plot and it is used with NO irony or derision, so we see successful middle- class families who attend church, pray together, and raise polite well- mannered children who sing religious songs at family gatherings. This is a feel-good movie with a huge principal cast, so I must limit this to just a few.They are:* Taye Diggs (&#34;Baggage Claim&#34;) is Harper, that selfsame author, back on the prowl again in quest of a topic for a new book. Since his first book's middling success, he seems to be in a sophomore slump. (He was The Best Man 15 years ago.)* Sanaa Lathan (&#34;The Cleveland Show&#34;) is his wife Robyn, finally due to have a baby (Harper has a low sperm count); problem is, it's breach so she's scheduled for a C-section right after the holidays.* Morris Chestnut (&#34;Ladder 49&#34;) is Lance, our Alpha dog: a pro football player, a devoted husband, and a loving father of four (he was the groom 15 years ago). Mr. Chestnut says he doesn't take his shirt off in every film, but I am happy to report that in this one he DOES!* Monica Calhoun (Lots of TV) is Mia, Lance's adored wife and mother to his four children. (She was the bride 15 years ago.) In that crucial football game she watches with her youngsters, we see something that resembles a rugby scrum rather than a traditional football play.* Terrence Howard (&#34;Prisoners&#34;) is Quentin, a successful but wayward friend who is always in the middle of everything. I have never seen Mr. Howard so funny!* Nia Long (&#34;House of Lies&#34;) is an executive with a successful book publishing company. She wants her author to write a biography of a football player who just happens to be a personal friend.This R-rated outing contains sexual situations (not all the characters are devoted Christians) but stresses the importance of friendship, loyalty and trust. Expect plenty of profanity, lots of anatomical discussions, a girl fight, plus a time to laugh and a time to weep.All in all, this is a nice emotional workout for everyone; that's why movies are made, isn't it? Kudos to writer/director Malcolm D Lee (&#34;Welcome Home, Roscoe Jenkins&#34;). A happy and enthusiastic screening audience exited the theater Tuesday night.

The movie trailer looked fun. The movie poster looks fun. I was looking forward to fun. But the movie wasn't as fun to watch as I expected. These friends were dealing with issues that caused quite a bit of drama. And then something came to light that was so disappointing that I kept wondering why the script had to be written this way.

1637257,A1CDZNPO7U4E6N,B00BPEJZEM,LadyLestat,"[75, 76]","Bring your tissues ...The ""Best Man Holiday"" was way more than I expected it to be. This is the best movie of the year, in my opinion, but I don't think it's really appropriate for children so don't let the ""Holiday"" part fool you. This is a very underrated cast of actors and actresses because these people have been in the game for a while now, but they still are not as respected as they should be for the superb thespians that they are. All of the original stars from the first movie have returned, and this one was even better than the first. I saw ""The Best Man"" fifteen years ago, and I loved it then, so this sequel was long overdue. Stars include: Taye Diggs (Harper), Terrance Howard (Quentin), Morris Chestnut (Lance), Harold Perrineau, Jr (Julian), Nia Long (Jordan), Regina Hall (Candace), Monica Calhoun (Mia), Sanaa Lathan (Robin), Melissa DeSousa (Shelby), and new cast member Eddie Cibrian (Brian). This movie had a deeper story that was way more serious than the first film. It's about pride, loyalty, family, friendship, and understanding that everyone needs somebody at some point in their lives.This movie picks right up where the first one left off, and it brings you up to speed about where these characters have been all this time. I thought that was a clever move because it's clear that a lot has happened. Harper and Robin got married, and are expecting their first child, and clearly you can tell there is some tension in their relationship due to fertility problems as well as financial issues. Candance and Julian have gotten married, and they have two daughters, but Candace still can't escape the consequences of her old profession, and it is brought up a lot that she used to be a stripper, but Shelby is also still a major problem for both of them. Shelby is back, and she's now a reality show television star which is a perfect job for Shelby since she's so overdramatic, but she's also divorced with a daughter of her own now. However, while she continues stirring the pot with Candance and Julian she has bigger problems than she realizes. Jordan, the careerwoman, is back, but this time she has a boyfriend who surprises everybody by being just a little bit lighter than what they were expecting. Jordan's strength, as well as her control issues continue to keep her from obtaining happiness, but she soon realizes that she doesn't have it all. Quentin is still single, lewd, crude, and perhaps one of the realest characters ever, but I was pleased to see that he could also be a serious character with a soft side. Terrance Howard MADE this movie for me! Lastly, Lance and Mia are still married, they now have four children, and Lance is still playing pro-football better than ever, but after a while it becomes clear that they needed to get the old crew back together for a reason, and it is shocking.I absolutely loved the cameos by Anthony Hamilton and Marsha Ambrosius, and if you saw the first film, you'll totally see the significance behind the song they are singing, and if you are familiar with the music you'll love the soundtrack as well because there are great songs from different R&B; stars. I can't say enough good things about this movie.

First, let me say that I didn't watch the original Best Man, but you can still follow and enjoy this film regardless of whether you watched the first installation. It stands on its own. In this movie, a group of old college friends reunite. Candace and Julian are a married couple expecting their first child, after years of struggling  to get pregnant. Candace has the added struggle of trying to overcome her past as a stripper. Jordan is a career woman whose control issues are keeping her from the happiness both she and her new boyfriend deserve. Quentin is the comic relief most of the time, but he can also pull of a serious front when the situation calls for it. And of course you have the original couple who started it all. Lance and Mia have been married for years and have four children together. He's a pro-football player living the high life. It all seems like just a fun college reunion, but there is a deeper reason for the get-together and when that secret is revealed it will leave the audience reeling.Best Man Holiday is a fun and emotion packed film. The movie touches on a lot of common issues, including infertility, financial struggles, and overcoming the past.The cast gives a stellar performance. I was really impressed with the movie and I'm surprised I didn't hear more about it.

I predicted the tear jerker long before it was revealed one of the characters was dying; I should not have been able to guess that one of the characters had to die; but nothing else happened in the movie&#8230; so someone had to die!If you like dialog, then this is the movie for you.  If you enjoy watching a movie where people sit around and talk and talk and talk&#8230; then give it a five star rating and start the show!  The Best Man Holiday is about these couples who go to the professional athletes home to&#8230; talk (of course during the Christmas season).  These people are supposed to all be successful, well-educated young couples.  There is one scene where two of the women get into a fight (yes, I said a physical fight because most successful well-educated people get into brawls regularly) in front of their children, calling each other names that I can&#8217;t repeat because Amazon will kick out this review.  What kind of a person goes to someone else&#8217;s home and fights in front of children, calling their mother a prostitute?&#8230; Wait a minute, there&#8217;s more disbelief around the corner:  who invites a group of people to their home and doesn&#8217;t bother mentioning that they&#8217;re dying?  The guest find out by witnessing her having a coughing fit.

1637311,A1XT8AJB7S9JJG,B00BPEJZEM,Tony Heck,"[2, 5]","&#34;It doesn't feel like Christmas to me.&#34; After 15 years of not being together Lance (Chestnut) and Mia (Calhoun) invite all their friends to their house for Christmas. Almost immediately old feelings come up and tensions start to mount. When secrets are revealed the life-long friendships are threatened. Before I start I will admit I have never seen the original movie but the first five minutes seemed like a recap and at no time did I feel lost. I didn't really have any of the character back stories but I caught up pretty fast. As far as this movie goes I wasn't expecting anything all that amazing and was a little hesitant. The main reason for that is because I have never been a Tyler Perry fan (not to sound racist). Even though this isn't one of his movies that is what I was expecting. I'm not sure if it was my low expectations or not but I really enjoyed this much much more then I thought I was going to. The best way to describe this is a version of Why Did I Get Married but funnier and with more like-able characters. This movie is funny but has a real plot and real emotion in it that sucks you in and makes you care about each character. I can't say how it compares to the first one but I can tell you I really did enjoy this one. Overall, a better version of Why Did I Get Married that surprised me as to how much I enjoyed it. I give this a high B+.",4,I can't say how it compares to the first one but I really did enjoy this one.

I expected some of the same class that was shown in the Best Man.  The only person that I felt was truly disfunctional in the original Best Man was Morris Chestnuts Character who was always threatening and cursing, but lifted up God and struck out at anyone who did not.  What a hypocrite.When I watched the Best Man Holiday on Saturday night, I did not expect the Chestnut Character to still kit the Taye Diggs Character at the beginning of the movie, because they became friendly after the wedding in the first movie.Now, the Morris Chestnut Character seems to be a cracked out running back who is on his last hurahh and a cas of characters who are all having problems except Q.  He always seem to rise to the top like silky cream.  The one suprise was Candice.  in the first movie, she was was the struggling college student trying to make a buck to stay in college, &#34;Murch&#34; married her and in the Holiday Movie, she was a straight street &#34;W&#34; who could not seem to shake the streets.  All of the goins on in the house were done as if children were not present.  Poor Mia....the only conscious-effect in the flick had and was  be killed off with cancer, in order to bring the disfunctionlal group to their senses.
