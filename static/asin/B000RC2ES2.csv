1081049,AVT9Q9PTUCDMR,B000RC2ES2,Brian Maitland,"[0, 0]","I won't give anything away about our boys but nothing really mindblowing happens in this half a season. Splitting the DVD set into two was a dumb idea for fans of this show. Can you say ""marketing""?The extras are so-so although the lengthy cast and director/producer sitdown Q&A; reveal a lot but they do seem obsessed with location shooting. As someone who does not live in LA, I could care less how accurate the settings are. Who really cares they are shooting scenes at an actual restaurant or bar the Hollywood glitterati hang out at? It means zip to myself.I do like the scenes at Laker games or at concerts but as far as the rest, they could shoot on the moon for all I care, as it's the relationships between the four guys that drives this show not the locations.I'll be honest, the series better pick up in Season Four as the only decent storylines are Turtle possibly gaining an actual girlfriend and Ari and Lloyd having a nice moment in one outstanding episode.Plus I still don't get Vince as a sex symbol. The guy looks wimpy and is not even remotely cute (this taken from a straw poll of ten female co-workers) and even in this series Adrian Grenier still can't act his way out of a plastic bag (re., check his IMDB list of credits).Watchable but total fluff really.",3,same as it ever was,1326672000,"01 16, 2012",2012,1279,"['wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'boys', 'nothing', 'really', 'mindblowing', 'happens', 'half', 'season', 'Splitting', 'DVD', 'set', 'two', 'was', 'dumb', 'idea', 'fans', 'show', 'Can', 'say', 'marketing', 'extras', 'are', 'so-so', 'lengthy', 'cast', 'director/producer', 'sitdown', 'Q', 'A', 'reveal', 'lot', 'do', 'seem', 'obsessed', 'location', 'shooting', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'live', 'LA', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'how', 'accurate', 'settings', 'are', 'Who', 'really', 'are', 'shooting', 'scenes', 'actual', 'restaurant', 'bar', 'Hollywood', 'glitterati', 'hang', 'out', 'zip', 'myself.I', 'do', 'scenes', 'Laker', 'games', 'concerts', 'as', 'far', 'rest', 'could', 'shoot', 'moon', 'care', 'relationships', 'four', 'guys', 'show', 'not', 'locations.I', ""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'series', 'better', 'pick', 'up', 'Season', 'Four', 'only', 'decent', 'storylines', 'are', 'Turtle', 'possibly', 'gaining', 'actual', 'girlfriend', 'Ari', 'Lloyd', 'having', 'nice', 'moment', 'one', 'outstanding', 'episode.Plus', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Vince', 'sex', 'symbol', 'guy', 'wimpy', 'not', 'even', 'remotely', 'cute', 'taken', 'straw', 'poll', 'ten', 'female', 'co-workers', 'even', 'series', 'Adrian', 'Grenier', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'way', 'plastic', 'bag', 're.', 'check', 'IMDB', 'list', 'credits', '.Watchable', 'total', 'fluff', 'really']","Entourage: Season 3, Part 2"

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[1, 1]","Interesting for a show that follows the entourage of a Hollywood actor, and makes much of the dichotomy between ""the artists"" (who lean towards prestige projects with actual acting, writing, etc.) and ""the suits"" (who ALWAYS have an eye on the money-making potential of a project) that HBO decided to break this admittedly SLIGHTLY longer season into two pieces - and charge the same for this 8 episode set as for the other 12 episode sets.  The show that glorifies the artist and derides the suits is presented here in a COMPLETELY ""suit"" decision.  Sad.Do you feel a little jerked around?  I do.This is not at all an indictment on these 8 delicious episodes.  Vinny has a professional breakup with Ari, but Ari still hovers just over Vince's horizon, trying to woo him back.  Johnny Drama's show ""Five Towns"" debuts and the wonderful insecure bravado almost melts down when the reviews start.  In one wonderful episode Drama is the targeted for a ""Punk'd"" type show hosted by Pauly Shore. After stealing a parking spot from UFC Champion Chuck Liddell Johnny is convinced that the professional brawler will be coming for revenge.  They go home and tee up UFC footage - showing Liddell pounding another professional into smithereens.  It is really a tribute to Kevin Dillon's acting ability that I simultaneously felt  sympathy for Drama and was laughing my head off as he whimpered to his buds ""sweet, merciful Jesus"", imagining Liddell doing some similar damage to his insecure face.Vince has a new agent, played by Carla Gugino, after firing Ari, and the tension between the three of them is palpable.  There are several excellent Ari moments - such as Ari's sudden acquisition of a little humanity making him unable to fire an agent who is losing money.  Ari's shrink tries telling him that his new compassion is a GOOD thing, but he is desperate to get his ""edge"" back.  Another brilliant episode has Ari and another of his Jewish clients (Nick Rubenstein, played in matching apoplectic fashion by Adam Goldberg) trying to close a deal on Yom Kippor - while surrounded by their families and other worshipers who think that doing business, using any transportation other than foot, even using a phone, is a sin against God.  Ari has never been more torn.Turtle gets a hot romantic interest - the daughter of the custom car shop where he has Drama's cruiser fixed up.  Eric is mainly a sidekick to Vince, although in one humorous episode he is hoping for a weekend retreat to Napa with girlfriend Sloan.  He gets his wish, but as the saying goes - be careful what you wish for...So - 8 excellent episodes of a superb series - with you the viewer jerked around by exactly the kind of people the creative artists of this series despise.

For the wife, it's a given.  For the husband, he demands it to keep her happy.  And Vince bails.  Why did this ring false to me?  Because Vince has had sex with EVERYONE in Hollywood, from his co-stars to the girls hanging out in Starbucks to a cashier in a Barnes & Noble to his new agent.  Plus, he even tells Eric that he has a ""thing"" for Eastern European women--which the Saudi prince's wife is the stereotype.The Pablo Escobar project means everything to Vince.  He's willing to sacrifice his career, his finances, even Ari to get his hands on it.
