I am glad you asked! Alton Brown wrote 3 large books with tons and tons of information (Volume 1 the Early Years, Volume 2 the Middle Years, Volume 3 the Later Years). Each book is written by, you guessed it - episode! The books are packed with information and make a great middle school/high school food science curriculum/culinary (backed up with additional sources yes) program.Of course, you need the episodes to go along with each chapter of the book. By not having the seasons released - the value of what this book could actually &#34;do&#34; is diminished quite a bit. So, could you maybe do the world a favor (okay, maybe not the entire world, how about food nerds with little food nerds) a let these two same named projects be used in tandem with each other as intended.",5,Please release the DVD's Again,1392768000,"02 19, 2014",2014,925,"['Okay', 'first', 'really', 'do', 'love', 'episodes', 'Good', 'Eats', 'have', 'watched', 'said', 'Food', 'Network', 'please', 'release', 'videos', 'season', 'Why', 'am', 'glad', 'asked', 'Alton', 'Brown', 'wrote', '3', 'large', 'books', 'tons', 'tons', 'information', 'Volume', '1', 'Early', 'Years', 'Volume', '2', 'Middle', 'Years', 'Volume', '3', 'Later', 'Years', 'book', 'written', 'guessed', 'episode', 'books', 'are', 'packed', 'information', 'make', 'great', 'middle', 'school/high', 'school', 'food', 'science', 'curriculum/culinary', 'backed', 'up', 'additional', 'sources', 'yes', 'program.Of', 'course', 'need', 'episodes', 'go', 'along', 'chapter', 'book', 'not', 'having', 'seasons', 'released', 'value', 'what', 'book', 'could', 'actually', '34', 'do', '34', 'diminished', 'quite', 'bit', 'So', 'could', 'maybe', 'do', 'world', 'favor', 'okay', 'maybe', 'not', 'entire', 'world', 'how', 'about', 'food', 'nerds', 'little', 'food', 'nerds', 'let', 'two', 'same', 'named', 'projects', 'be', 'used', 'tandem', 'other', 'intended']",Good Eats: The Complete Second Season

Less for the specific recipes than for his approach to food and teaching cooking as opposed to just following a plan he teaches people to actually cook all covering it in a mass of pop culture references.In the past the Food channel has released his programs in topic focused sets- holiday foods/roasts/ fish etc. but for the real fan the whole season is more fun as you can rediscover episodes maybe you missed and wouldn&#8217;t get in the topic.That having been said the price of these, as good as they are, at $100 is way too high. I&#8217;d suggest looking elsewhere and hoping that the Food TV people release later season on DVD.",5,a great cooking show that really teaches to cook.,1401148800,"05 27, 2014",2014,679,"['Alton', 'Brown', 'one', 'favorite', 'TV', 'chefs', 'Less', 'specific', 'approach', 'food', 'teaching', 'cooking', 'opposed', 'just', 'following', 'plan', 'people', 'actually', 'cook', 'covering', 'mass', 'pop', 'culture', 'past', 'Food', 'channel', 'released', 'programs', 'topic', 'focused', 'sets-', 'holiday', 'foods/roasts/', 'fish', 'etc', 'real', 'fan', 'whole', 'season', 'more', 'fun', 'can', 'rediscover', 'episodes', 'maybe', 'missed', 'wouldn', '8217', 'get', 'topic.That', 'having', 'been', 'said', 'price', 'as', 'good', 'are', '100', 'way', 'too', 'high', '8217', 'suggest', 'looking', 'elsewhere', 'hoping', 'Food', 'TV', 'people', 'release', 'later', 'season', 'DVD']",Good Eats: The Complete Second Season
