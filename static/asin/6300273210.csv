238944,A35QF1GDLAFYCL,6300273210,"A. Calabrese ""othernj""","[1, 1]","It is hard to believe that the film, A Face in the Crowd, directed by Elia Kazan, screenplay by Bud Schulberg, is 50 years old.  It is as if Kazan and Schulberg could see into the future, the future of TV that is.  In today's world of gotcha journalism, scandal is the norm, but in the 1950's TV was still a fairly new medium.  A Face in the Crowd shows just how even in its infancy TV was already a corrupting power, its power in the visual.  Andy Griffith as the hustler, near do well, Larry ""Lonesome"" Rhodes is frightening.  If you only know Griffith as Opie Taylor's father you are in for a surprise and a shock.  Griffith's character plays off of the early optimism of the Patricia Neal character, Marcia Jeffries.  If Lonesome is corrupted by power, Marcia buys into the wealth TV can generate.  With great supporting actors like Walter Matthau and Tony Franciosa there is not a dull moment in this film.  Simply, A Face in the Crowd is a much overlooked film classic.

238945,A18BD98SU49UB7,6300273210,"Adam Hunnicutt ""A.H.""","[0, 0]","Andy Griffith succeeds in pulling off an act of pure madness in this chronicle of the rise and fall of a superstar.A Face in the Crowd is a mezmerizing film from start to finish. You get introduced to the character Lonesome Rhodes as he lay passed out in a jail cell. A local radio news reporter, played by Patricia Niel, is scouting for new talent and happens to see this explosive accident waiting to happen sprawled across the floor. She wakes him up and convinces him to sing into her recorder for the program she hosts. He whips out his old guitar (the love of his life) tries to sober a little, then makes up an ol' tune on the spot. Thus begins the immediate success of Lonesome Rhodes. Unfortunately, when the big mouth antics of this loose cannon give away the true intentions of his heart, an incredible twist formulates and the world comes crashing down.A face in the crowd is loosely based on a personality during the fifties known as the ""IL Redhead"" Author Godfrey. He was one of the biggest country sensation in 57, or the decade for that matter.From beginning to end A Face in the Crowd is a 2 hour 5 minute journey that I couldn't shake. It should be considered for AFI's top one hundred list simply because it broke a mold unlike anyone had seen at that time. This should be required viewing for film buffs and lovers of great performances. ~SAOS~",5,Rise and Fall,1110240000,"03 8, 2005",2005,1365,"['Andy', 'Griffith', 'pulling', 'off', 'act', 'pure', 'madness', 'chronicle', 'rise', 'fall', 'superstar.A', 'Face', 'Crowd', 'mezmerizing', 'film', 'start', 'finish', 'get', 'introduced', 'character', 'Lonesome', 'Rhodes', 'lay', 'passed', 'out', 'jail', 'cell', 'local', 'radio', 'news', 'reporter', 'played', 'Patricia', 'Niel', 'scouting', 'new', 'talent', 'see', 'explosive', 'accident', 'waiting', 'happen', 'sprawled', 'floor', 'wakes', 'up', 'convinces', 'sing', 'recorder', 'program', 'out', 'old', 'guitar', 'love', 'life', 'sober', 'little', 'then', 'up', 'ol', 'tune', 'spot', 'Thus', 'immediate', 'success', 'Lonesome', 'Rhodes', 'Unfortunately', 'when', 'big', 'mouth', 'antics', 'loose', 'cannon', 'give', 'away', 'true', 'intentions', 'heart', 'incredible', 'twist', 'formulates', 'world', 'crashing', 'down.A', 'face', 'crowd', 'loosely', 'based', 'personality', 'fifties', 'known', 'IL', 'Redhead', 'Author', 'Godfrey', 'was', 'one', 'biggest', 'country', 'sensation', '57', 'decade', 'matter.From', 'beginning', 'end', 'Face', 'Crowd', '2', 'hour', '5', 'minute', 'journey', 'could', ""n't"", 'shake', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'AFI', 'top', 'one', 'hundred', 'list', 'simply', 'broke', 'mold', 'anyone', 'had', 'seen', 'time', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'film', 'buffs', 'lovers', 'great', 'performances', '~SAOS~']",A Face in the Crowd VHS
238946,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6300273210,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[5, 6]","Like the roar of a lion or the maniacal laugh of thousands, Andy Griffith burst on the screen with a performance unmatched in the past 53 years. Using the direction of the infamous Elia Kazan, and words by Budd Schulberg, ""A Face in the Crowd"" transformed from a personal struggle with fame into a political statement of power. Since the birth of radio and television, or even before, the concept of celebrity followed side by side. This select 1% of the population was used to sell ads, promote products, and lastly, entertain the populous. Not much has changed as Hollywood has evolved; the wealthy still control and the audience still depend on their favorite voice to tell them what to get at the grocery store. The interesting point about this, explored deeply in Schulberg's script, is how quickly the mass audiences can casual drop one figure and follow anew. As one reads this review, the teens may have forgotten the Jonas Brothers and found a new follower, our Late Night hosts may all have new faces, and our ""Avatar"" may not be barreling through the theaters. Even as I write this, it feels stale. Surprisingly, watching ""A Face in the Crowd"" for the first time, there was a lack of preparedness for these points. One doesn't expect such a modern film found in 1957 (much less lead by the sheriff of Mayberry), but within the first twenty minutes, the average viewer will be surprised by what the screen allows. With bold direction, amazing acting, and valid, detailed points about our entertainment industry, ""A Face in the Crowd"" makes its mark in 1957 and remains valuable today in 2010 - one could even argue MORE valuable today.While watching this film, there is one person that steals the screen in the opening minutes and never releases for a solid two hours. His name is Andy Griffith, and while he will always be known as the quintessential small town hero, his film debut proved his range went further. With a diabolical laugh, a country-boy appeal, and a voice that could swoon anyone within an earshot, he takes what should have been a role for a seasoned veteran, and creates this iconic role that, after watching the film, could only be done by Mayberry himself. From his introduction in a cell recovering from a drunken disorderly charge, he finds his escape in the form of Patricial Neal, who in turn, introduces Griffith to the world of radio; aka mass audiences. Using a form of trickery, Neal demonstrates Griffith's power and the world welcomes him (unsuspectingly) with open arms. The small town of Arkansas does anything he wants, but he doesn't stop there. By becoming our very first Howard Stern, he does what he wants and says anything at all - and becomes the infamous ""Demigod in Denim"". The shift in Griffith's character is subtle, yet somewhat planned. He portrays Lonesome Rhodes as a man inheriting luck, but the calculated look on his face indicates otherwise. That is the perplexity of Griffith, one believes that it is just him being himself, but he peppers within his lines these moments of unknown - where perhaps this was Rhodes' plan all along. Bridled next to both Neal, who adds a strong level of support, sexuality, and madness, and a youthful Walter Matthau who brings the final worded-axe down at the finale; it doesn't surprised the ability and range that Griffith had to accomplish. The acting in this film will not only surprise, but also impress. This is the type of quality that Hollywood could produce, yet rarely do we see.Having just finished ""Cabin in the Cotton"", a film that used politics as a miscalculation to cinema, it was impressive to see Elia Kazan handle this issue with artistic talent as well as solid direction. Despite his dismay in Hollywood, his talent behind the camera glimmered in this feature as colors (blacks and whites) were bold, the symbolism was apparent, and the emotions were captured perfectly. He guided Neal through her tragic turn, while keeping Matthau solid as a rock throughout. He controlled Griffith, while allowing him to run throughout the scenes with ease. ""Face in the Crowd"" is a difficult film to direct, as there is both emotion and intent running rampant, but Kazan proves the he can handle Schulberg's words. There are scenes that just feel, and look, more modern than 1957. The one that immediately pops into mind is the montage surrounding Rhodes' introduction into Vitajex. The blend of animation, perverse snippets, and that disturbing laugh didn't feel old - it felt like a moment taken from 2010 (just in black and white). There are others like that scene throughout. The baton competition was one of the most intensely awkward scenes, as we knew what was happening, but didn't want to believe it. Again, modern ideas strewn throughout 1957, where the average '57 film felt didn't push the envelope - Kazan didn't care about the envelope.Finally, Schulberg's script has to be one of the best Hollywood stories to come out of that town. The images of Griffith laughing stapled behind several TV antennae, just barely scares the average viewer. Schulberg, like Kazan, isn't afraid of his idea. He pushes from radio to television, an audience of one to millions upon millions, and finally guiding politicians into office. Does this feel like an old idea? The modern implications are outstanding. The language as well, coming from Griffith (who had to ad-lib some) is wildly entertaining, but subtly symbolic, and those final thoughts by Matthau require another viewing just to hear again. Everyone, from writing to direction to acting, gave ""Face in the Crowd"" more than 100% of their talent, and this critic believes that Griffith may have fallen into the Mayberry sinkhole too soon. If this was his ability, he was surely wasted in Hollywood.VIDEO: Impressive throughout. The scenes were well focused, detailed and developed. Characters became iconic, giving some of the best lines from a motion picture. Flawless.VISUAL: Watched on regular DVD, this film would benefit from a Blu-upgrade. Even without, the visuals were stark, clear, and vibrant. The use of multi-media to tell this story seemed futuristic of sorts. This was an amazing film to experience, but a bold film to watch.SOUND: This had to be top-notch for the film to work. When Griffith yelled, we heard him; when he played his music, we heard him; whenever he spoke - yep, we heard him. That is the staple of this film, hearing Griffith's words - and we did - so the sound was perfect.EXTRAS: The only area lacking. A short documentary that talks to the cast about the film, but that was it. Why isn't there a Criterion release of this film - it seems like one of the best films in the last 50 years from America. It beats ""Network"" by a long shot. I would have liked to see more, experience this film more with stronger features - but it allows me to upgrade my disc down the road.Overall, wildly impressive. This has to be one of my favorite films watched this year and easily in my life-long Top Ten. Performances were immaculate, the direction was charged, and the words sparked controversy within the group as we discussed after our viewing. The use of media, sex, and power to create a man known only as Mr. Mayberry demonstrated a talent that went unused in Hollywood. Griffith demonstrated amazing talent, and I don't know if I could ever see him in anything else the same again. Bravo across the board, BRAVO!Grade: ***** out of *****",5,"A Face in the Crowd; or, Andy Griffith's Missed Oscar",1268179200,"03 10, 2010",2010,7423,"['roar', 'lion', 'maniacal', 'laugh',

238950,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6300273210,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 9]","In deep respect for the actress that we recently lost, my fingers are moved to review a film with which she shown as bright as she possibly could.  Yes, Patricia Neal was a beacon in her day, an actress who proved her worth time and time again and managed to create an image of greatness without ever becoming a solidified celebrity.  Despite her marvelous talent, Pat only received two Oscar nominations (thankfully she won for her BRILLIANT performance in `Hud').  Regardless of my feelings on this film in general (it's rather overblown and preposterous at times), Neal was flawless and really the films sole human element.  She deserved a nomination for sure (and at times I'm tempted to hand her the win).  I'm going to keep this short and sweet.  The film itself is overcooked.  It has some nice qualities, but in the end it pushes itself too far and becomes overtly melodramatic and unbelievable, which is sad since this film had all the potential to become a poignant and moving slice of realism.  It carries a weighty message (one that is beats us over the head as of late) with regards to the media and its influence (not to mention the power with which it destroys) but the way the script goes haywire in the films final hours only strips it of its soul.  Andy Griffith serves us something of a maniacal turn, which is so unlike him, with mixed results.  Walter Matthau is used to effective degrees, but he (and everyone else for that matter) is sidelined by the ferocity within Patricia Neal's performance.  She is just breathtakingly good.  The film is so far beneath her that it is startling to witness the depth with which she attempts to bring to the script.  She does it justice and actually hands the film it's only moments of validity.  Sadly, the film as a whole does not step up to her strength and it becomes bewilderment to me.  So, while I can't recommend this film on its execution and overall effect alone, I can say that Neal's performance drives it thoroughly and definitely deserves your attention.",3,A few words on an underwhelming film and its deserved figure of greatness...,1281398400,"08 10, 2010",2010,2027,"['deep', 'respect', 'actress', 'recently', 'lost', 'fingers', 'are', 'moved', 'review', 'film', 'shown', 'as', 'bright', 'possibly', 'could', 'Yes', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'was', 'beacon', 'day', 'actress', 'who', 'proved', 'worth', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'managed', 'create', 'image', 'greatness', 'ever', 'becoming', 'solidified', 'celebrity', 'marvelous', 'talent', 'Pat', 'only', 'received', 'two', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'thankfully', 'won', 'BRILLIANT', 'performance', 'Hud', 'Regardless', 'feelings', 'film', 'general', 'rather', 'overblown', 'preposterous', 'times', 'Neal', 'was', 'flawless', 'really', 'films', 'sole', 'human', 'element', 'deserved', 'nomination', 'sure', 'times', ""'m"", 'tempted', 'hand', 'win', ""'m"", 'going', 'keep', 'short', 'sweet', 'film', 'overcooked', 'nice', 'qualities', 'end', 'too', 'far', 'overtly', 'melodramatic', 'unbelievable', 'sad', 'film', 'had', 'potential', 'become', 'poignant', 'moving', 'slice', 'realism', 'weighty', 'message', 'one', 'beats', 'head', 'late', 'regards', 'media', 'influence', 'not', 'mention', 'power', 'way', 'script', 'haywire', 'films', 'final', 'hours', 'only', 'soul', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'something', 'maniacal', 'turn', 'so', 'mixed', 'results', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'used', 'effective', 'degrees', 'everyone', 'else', 'matter', 'sidelined', 'ferocity', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'performance', 'just', 'breathtakingly', 'good', 'film', 'so', 'far', 'startling', 'witness', 'depth', 'bring', 'script', 'justice', 'actually', 'film', 'only', 'moments', 'validity', 'Sadly', 'film', 'whole', 'not', 'step', 'up', 'strength', 'bewilderment', 'So', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'film', 'execution', 'overall', 'effect', 'alone', 'can', 'say', 'Neal', 'performance', 'thoroughly', 'definitely', 'attention']",A Face in the Crowd VHS

He is discovered by Patricia Neal's character and he begins a ""Will Rogers"" type of career.

Sloan,"[3, 3]","I'm not going to write about the symbolism or get into political jousting where this film is concerned because that doesn't matter to me in the least.  All I know is that from the first time I saw this approximately 10 years ago on AMC one Saturday morning, I've wondered who the hell was Andy Griffith's agent back then and why did he keep him out of movies of this callibur and genre.  I barely remembered that Matthau, Remmick and Franciosa were even in it.  He engulfed each and every scene he was in like nothing I'd ever seen before.  He chewed up anyone else who had the misfortune of even being in the same scene with him in this movie.With this being one of his first movies (the other standout being No Time for Sargents) you'd think he'd have been typecast as a villian, and maybe that's why his agent avoided his getting this type of role.  His take of the down-home county boy radio show ham who hands out bits of wisdom as Lonesome Rhodes starts out like a quaint little fire in a pot-bellied stove that warms you and is comforting.  But all of that quickly gets out of control as he is discovered and the flames of his new level of fame whip out of control and engulfs EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE that comes in contact with Lonesome.  (Even his loyal listening audience)Andy's boisterous, obnoxious and outrageous performance might have easily come off as over the top in someone else's hands but he is so believable that you too can feel the wave of ego build inside him yourself, yet you can only do much like Patricia Neal does; stand back with your mouth open in astonishment and hold on for the ride or get run down like a dog in the street.  Andy's Lonesome Rhodes character is much like an approaching train wreck, you know it's coming, you know it's going to be a bad scene littered with bodies when it's over but somehow you just can't look away.

The film is the most powerful statement (including &quot;Network&quot;)  ever made on the power of television.  Andy Griffith (in his film debut)  turns in the performance of his career as Lonesome Rhodes, a hobo who is  discovered by Patricia Neal, who has a radio program in a small Arkansas  town.  Rhodes' charismatic charm and appeal drive him from a small radio  show to a Memphis television station to national folk hero.  Rhodes becomes  so powerful that he influences and controls everything he touches from  advertising to possibly even the next President of the United States.  It  soon becomes clear to Neal, who becomes his plaything, that Rhodes is  becoming obsessed with his newfound power.This is a tremendous film  that has sadly been forgotten.  Griffith gave many good performances after  this, most of them much lighter, but never came close (and probably never  got the chance) to matching this role.  Some of the scenes ask the audience  to go a bit far out on a limb, but an incredible performance in an  incredible film.

It is a &#34;good&#34; wholesome family show that we can watch without the worry of improper innuendos and suggestive comments that you get with so many other shows! So when we saw that there were other movies that Andy Griffith played in, we were very excited and ordered several of them. I guess we just had the perception that Andy Griffith would have the same values and similar characteristics in all of his movies as he did in his role as Andy Taylor. However, we were disappointed when we found out that he plays roles of people with quite different characteristics in other movies. The roles that he plays in other movies includes characteristics of self-centeredness, pride, arrogance, loud-mouthed, vagrant and a rebel. All of these are basically quite the opposite characteristics of the image that we had developed of Andy Griffith.In this movie Andy Griffith starts out as person in jail that a reporter wants to interview. She was impressed with his straight forwardness and saying what he felt that she got him a spot of his own on her radio station. He ends up getting very popular. Throughout the whole movie he is a loud-mouthed, egotistical person that is very conceited and stuck on himself. More than once, it is obvious that he was having an affair with someone and ends up having an affair with the lady that initially got him the job. Supposedly they are going to get married but then on a road trip he eyes a 17 year old girl and marries her. I ended up just shutting the movie off because I didn't care for this type of personality. This was the first one of the movies that I ordered that I watched. It really shocked me because of the impression I had of Andy Griffith as Sheriff Taylor and this was a complete opposite characteristic. I would not recommend it to anyone. Not only because of the role he played but also because I just don't care for this type of movie.

He catapults to radio and TV stardom under the guise of being an aw-shucks homeboy who loves his fans. In fact, Lonesome Rhodes is a slimy, greedy, egotistical, manipulative womanizer with underhanded political aspirations and nothing but contempt for his gullible audience.  The film was far ahead of its time in its theme and telling, and Andy Griffith gives a blazing performance that rivals Burt Lancaster's in ""Elmer Gantry"" (for which Lancaster won an Oscar).  That this film wasn't even nominated for any awards is very surprising.I also am saddened that it's never been released on DVD; it's one of the best of its kind I have ever seen, and was certainly Griffith's plum role and best performance.  With a stellar supporting cast, including Patricia Neal, Walter Matthau, Tony Franciosa and a beautiful Lee Remick in her first film role, ""A Face in the Crowd"" is a must-see film, and should eradicate any opinion you may have that Griffith was only capable of his wholesome TV roles of Sheriff Taylor and Ben Matlock.",5,"""A guitar beats a woman every time!""",1106179200,"01 20, 2005",2005,1467,"['film', 'what', 'fine', 'actor', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'truly', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'mastered', 'had', 'not', 'chosen', 'Mayberry', 'path', 'instead.Directed', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'political', 'drama', 'satire', 'commercialism', 'Face', 'Crowd', 'story', 'Lonesome', 'Rhodes', 'Griffith', 'charismatic', 'guitar-playing', 'drifter', 'who', 'discovered', 'radio', 'executive', 'Marcia', 'Jeffries', 'husky-voiced', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'jail', 'public', 'drunk', 'charge', 'catapults', 'radio', 'TV', 'stardom', 'guise', 'being', 'aw-shucks', 'homeboy', 'who', 'fans', 'fact', 'Lonesome', 'Rhodes', 'slimy', 'greedy', 'egotistical', 'manipulative', 'womanizer', 'underhanded', 'political', 'aspirations', 'nothing', 'contempt', 'gullible', 'audience', 'film', 'was', 'far', 'ahead', 'time', 'theme', 'telling', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'blazing', 'performance', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'Elmer', 'Gantry', 'Lancaster', 'won', 'Oscar', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'nominated', 'awards', 'very', 'surprising.I', 'also', 'am', 'saddened', 'never', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'one', 'best', 'kind', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'was', 'certainly', 'Griffith', 'plum', 'role', 'best', 'performance', 'stellar', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'Tony', 'Franciosa', 'beautiful', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'first', 'film', 'role', 'Face', 'Crowd', 'must-see', 'film', 'should', 'eradicate', 'opinion', 'may', 'have', 'Griffith', 'was', 'only', 'capable', 'wholesome', 'TV', 'roles', 'Sheriff', 'Taylor', 'Ben', 'Matlock']",A Face in the Crowd VHS

Once Griffith leaves the countryside for NYC his role condenses to a one-dimensional personality - with a huge set of lungs.

Barten,"[0, 3]","I am so fond of Budd Schulberg, and Andy Griffith went on to become among our biggest TV stars when I was a youngun, so I expected A FACE IN THE CROWD to keep me entertained. What I hardly expected was that TV would end up being exposed as a medium which thrives on the possibility of turning young people who have a talent for communicating in a way that reminds people of Will Rogers into sales entities for commercial and political hokum. I also watched ""Hollywood Ending"" (2002) this week, which featured Woody Allen as an aging director who takes multiple medicines to match the activities of his day, and explaining it, says, ""And this one keeps me dry when it's raining."" Lonesome Rhodes (played by Andy Griffith) gets his start with a New York ad agency pushing pills that pep him up, but his ending is quite abrupt when a microphone is turned on to reveal his contempt for the folks he fools while the credits roll at the end of the show. That is not quite the ending, because after that he is at the top of a tall building and he feels like jumping off and you get to find out which other characters think it is such a good idea, they can hardly wait.Modern democracy still depends on TV, or bombing television stations, in the case of those enemies who dare to broadcast propaganda about NATO or the sole surviving super power. I don't watch much TV myself, but I see little clips on the internet that engage in demeaning whoever is trashing powerful mainstream media interests at the moment. The global economy is skewed to cater to an audience which has a lot in common with those early TV viewers seeing the Lonesome Rhodes Cracker Barrel and political huckster hour. Politically, Baghdad has turned into a pill that is like the battle of Gettysburg, where people ought to remember which army came the furthest to fight. Political scandals often reveal a character flaw that fits right into Aristotle's views on irreconcilable pride in his theory of tragedy, like President Clinton's sexual pride when a female White House intern turns on the power of her thong underwear, or George W. Bush's power to fire any U.S. Attorney who has some ideas about justice being used as a tool to help American Indians, which he does not personally believe in.

238960,AEOZZ0KYR4998,6300273210,Campbelldropout,"[1, 1]","I first heard about ""A Face in the Crowd"" after reading Andy Griffith's obituary in the Raleigh News and Observer.  The obituary discussed his performance in the film and how it was so far away from the character of Sheriff Andy Taylor. Growing up in North Carolina Andy Griffith is a legend and is only overshadowed by the myth of Andy Taylor.  The Andy Griffith show was the only work of his I had ever really seen and knew about. To me along with a majority of fans, Andy Griffith was Andy Taylor.  This image was shattered after watching ""A Face in the Crowd"". Now, this wasn't a horrible thing, it was a wonderful thing, it add a depth to Mr. Griffith which I had never known. His performance as Lonesome Rhodes was so raw and emotional, nothing like his later work or his TV show.  The character changes from a self-centered drunk to a self-centered celebrity. Even though the character is despicable Griffith plays him with so much charm it's amazing, at times you feel bad for hating the guy.  It's a shame that he never received a nomination for this film or let alone the Best Actor award. The other driving force in the film is Patricia Neal who holds her own against Griffith.  Her role progresses through the entire film and her role seems like a prequel to the character she ends up playing in ""Hud"".  The film also has some hints of ""Network"" and I got the feeling that Paul Newman and George Kennedy based their performances in ""Cool Hand Luke"" off of Griffith.  The film foretells the impact of television on politics, however, the power of the media over peoples is overstated when looking at the present day.  While there are some people that are worshiped in the media, I find it hard to believe they can influence people so easily.

Under Elia Kazan's masterful direction and with a brilliantly conceived script written by the venerable Budd Schulberg, ""A Face in the Crowd"" is a frightening vehicle which chronicles the ascension of an uneducated sham to the highest pinnacles of power.Griffith is discovered by roving reporter Marcia Jeffries played in an excellent performance by Patricia Neal, who works for a local radio station.  With tape recorder in hand she enters the local jail where Griffith is sleeping off a public drunkenness summons.  She gives him air time and amazingly his boisterous countrified jargon and down home philosophy instantly makes him a media favorite.  With his star on the the rise, he leaves Arkansas for Memphis and then soon after with sponsors clamoring after him, to the media capital of New York with Neal as his business advisor and girlfriend.Anthony Franciosa is recruited as his slick agent Joey and a team is assembled to serve Griffith's personal and professional needs.  Included in this team is writer Mel Miller played by Walter Matthau.  Griffith is soon seduced by the bright lights of notoriety and overindulges in sex, alcohol and corruption.  He jettisons the firmly grounded Neal and marries a beautiful baton twirling bimbo played by a gorgeous Lee Remick, also making her screen debut.Griffith soon becomes a boorish monster and a phony.

I'd like to think that the general public is a little more discerning and would not be so easily taken in by a megalomaniac like Lonesome Rhodes.  But then, the argument goes that Abe Lincoln would never be elected president today.  When you think about it our more successful presidencies, depending on your political persuasion, would be Kennedy, Reagan, and Clinton who were all masters of the medium.  I'd like to think of this film as more of a cautionary tale of the dangers of the new medium of television.  Director Elia Kazan from a script by Budd Schulberg have crafted their parable quite well.  I would like to think that Rhodes is not quite the monster that he inevitably became, that he started his career humbly and with good intentions only to be corrupted by forces that manipulated him to the darker side.  Andy Griffith, in probably one of the most criminally overlooked performances in American film history, is simply mesmerizing as Rhodes.  He manages to convey the folksiness tainted with contempt and self-loathing that ultimately is Lonesome Rhodes.  Patricia Neal is superb as Marcia Jeffries, the woman who discovers Rhodes and has mixed emotions about his fame.  Walter Matthau is also good as Mel Miller, a writer on Rhodes' show who feels he's sold his soul in the process.  I am trying to think of another film that tackled the beast that is television and the only comparable one that comes to mind is ""Network"".

However, this film is actually more relevant today than it was in the 50's because it deals with the power of celebrity and how it can control not only everyday life, but also politics.  Andy Griffith stars as a country bumpkin singer who is discovered by Patricia Neal while he is in an Arkansas jail after having been arrested for being drunk and disorderly.  He is somewhat of a nomad who she convinces to stick around and host a local radio show.  He becomes a beloved figure among the locals and finds that he has the power to influence people to do as he says as he dispenses advice in a friendly and folksy way over the radio.  Word spreads and his fame grows and he is offered a television job in New York City where he becomes more power hungry, believing his own publicity.  He is easily able to manipulate the public and because of this ability, political powers are clamoring for his advice and patronage.  He wasn't a nice guy to begin with and finds this power more than intoxicating.  The movie has a wonderful ending that should never be tampered with.  In addition to Andy Griffith's perfect and stellar performance, there are some wonderful supporting performances that more than hold their own against him.  You have a very young Walter Matthau as an idealistic writer who sees right through him from the start.  You have a beautiful young Lee Remick in her first acting role as a teenager who is infatuated with him.  Patricia Neal, who believes she can tame the wild beast, and Anthony Franciosa as a young advertising exec who wants to ride the waves of fame right with him.  With people so influenced and starved for celebrity today, you can see how this kind of media manipulation could take place.  Parts of the film are very dated and corny, but it only adds to the charm and effect.  Brilliantly directed by Elia Kazan.  This is one of my all time favorite black and white movies and there is nothing about it I would change.  As I said, how can you tamper with perfection?

Rhodes is a scary character -- equal  parts Elvis Presley and Huey Long -- and his transition from back-slapping yokel to heartless demagogue is briskly portrayed in this moody melodrama, directed by Elia Kazan.  Like &quot;Sweet Smell Of Success,&quot; which dealt with similar themes, the film hits a loud, hysterical tenor towards the  end, as Rhodes, who has charmed the nation, is revealed as the scoundrel he is.  Griffith's loud, powerful performance is remarkable, certainly unlike any role he's had before or since; also includes strong supporting roles by Patricia Neal (as the woman who discovers him) and Walter Matthau, as his rival, and a brief appearance by newcomer Lee Remick, who debuts as Lonesome's wife.

This is the story of a man named Lonesome Rhodes (played by Griffith) who was a simple country boy with little to no education.

The story shows how this highly liked country boy becomes totally corrupted by the end of the movie. It's a ""rags to riches to rags again"" story. All I really want to say here is that if you enjoy Andy Griffith, you won't want to pass up this gem. His second film, ""No Time for Sergeants"" is another incredible film but, unlike this film, he is a likeable country boy all through the film. In ""Face in the Crowd"" you either hate what he became or you feel very sad for him because of what fame and fortune did for him. I read one review saying that Lonesome Rhodes was evil, but I don't agree. I think what happened to Lonesome is extremely common. His stardom gave him money and power.

The choppy production of the film; however, betrays some what could have been award winning acting -- ending powerful scenes at times with a B-movie like feel.  Many potentially great scenes are also betrayed, with Matthau's voice of reason character coming across as underwhelming.  -- The film also features a young Tony Franciosa -- unfortunately, Kazan's ""attention span"" seems focused mainly on Griffith and his own favorite moments and scenes.The end result is a powerful film nonetheless, but one that like the Lonesome Rhodes character sabotages itself.Ultimately, it is gripping and engaging, but falls short of its potential -- nevertheless, its a film that's hard not to get thoroughly into as well as to emotionally react to.In retrospect, this seems like an example of a Hollywood Classic that in the right hands might very well deserve a remake... although who could be found to match Griffith's powerful performance... as well as Kazan's better directing moments???

238984,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6300273210,Ed Uyeshima,"[6, 7]","There are two major things that I find quite fascinating as I watch this 1957 classic. The first is the prophetic, hyper-realistic portrayal of television as a pervasive medium encroaching upon people's lives in ways unheard of back in the 1950's. The second is Andy Griffith's pull-all-the-stops performance as drunken hobo-turned-media sensation ""Lonesome"" Rhodes. For those who know Griffith only for his homespun TV portrayals, you will be surprised how remarkably he shows the venal underbelly and high-octane charisma of a character miles away from kindly, soft-spoken Sheriff Andy Taylor.Master filmmaker Elia Kazan and writer Budd Schulberg, collaborating for the second and last time after their brilliant ""On the Waterfront"" three years earlier, tell the story of Rhodes, a burgeoning pop-culture phenomenon thanks primarily to the efforts of Marcia Jeffries, a young radio program host who discovers him sprawled in a hangover on the floor of a rural Arkansas jail. He mesmerizes the local radio audience with an improvised country song about his predicament, ""Free Man in the Morning"", and this marks the beginning of his meteoric rise all the way to his own weekly national TV program. As he capitalizes on his folksy charm and empathetic manner, he becomes a power-crazed tyrant behind the scenes. A corporate tycoon wants to use Rhodes' influence to sway a Presidential campaign in his favor, and Rhodes' megalomania moves him lockstep into a Citizen Kane-like form of paranoia.It all seems exaggerated but it's brilliantly observed much like a film that covered the same themes twenty years later, Sidney Lumet and Paddy Chayefsky's ""Network"". However, even with strong doses of black comedy sprinkled throughout, Kazan and Schulberg use more melodramatic elements in their skewering until the near-Shakespearian climax when Rhodes' comeuppance takes on a grandly theatrical fervor. In a way, it seems a shame that Griffith never got another chance to bring out his dark side on the big screen. While sometimes wildly undisciplined in his film debut, he dexterously shows the cunning and charisma of his character to a level that makes his national celebrity utterly credible.Showing his amazing facility to elicit stellar work from a wide variety of actors, Kazan assembled a strong cast to back him up starting with Patricia Neal, who is just as devastating as Marcia, a woman torn between ambition, decency and her fateful attraction to Rhodes. An impossibly young Walter Matthau shows the beginnings of his cynical screen persona as Mel, a crafty television writer who de facto becomes Marcia's conscience. In their film debuts and making indelible impressions, Anthony Franciosa and Lee Remick play Joey, an office lackey who turns into Rhodes' immoral agent, and Betty Lou, a teenaged baton twirler seduced easily by Rhodes' power, respectively.If the film has one flaw, it's that it runs on a bit long for the parable it tells especially since Rhodes' moral ambiguity is pretty much settled in the first half of the story. Nevertheless, this movie is essential viewing as it not only shows a powerful early indictment of television (and supports Marshall McLuhan's mantra, ""The medium is the message"") but provides another example of the underappreciated artistry of Kazan and Schulberg.

I would never deny that the film is still worth seeing, but I'm not so sure it retains its original zing... or sting.The film was made during TV's infancy, when the power of the new medium was beginning to be realized.  Writer Shulberg and Director Kazan no doubt felt that they were addressing an issue of real concern, and very likely they were.  I recall my own family having an awe of what they saw on the TV screen that is hard to find today.  But I do not believe they--or many of their contemporaries--were swayed by the medium to the extent that this film suggests.  And did Kazan and Schulberg ever realize the extent of the skepticism toward the media that the generations who grew up with television would eventually exhibit?  Well, perhaps with efforts like this, they could even claim some credit for that skepticism--presuming that that was the desired effect.Still this movie has much to commend it.  Andy Griffith delivers a powerful performance as the egomaniacal TV-icon, &quot;Lonesome&quot; Rhodes.  He is a far cry from Mayberry...to say nothing of his character's mythic Riddle, Ark.  Patricia Neal, Tony Franciosa and Walter Matthau provide solid support, and a very young, captivating Lee Remick made her film debut here.  Kazan's direction keeps the sometimes heavy-handed story moving apace.  The film's power is ultimately only diminished by the fact that its message was well-heeded--at least by some.",4,As relevant today??

It has the impact of someone smashing glass on your face, it's that powerful. It is very, very timely, and hasn't dated one bit. Kazan was onto something here, on how TV destroys legitimate debate, and how easily manipulated the masses can be with this medium. Andy Griffith gives arguably his best performance as the troubled drunk (which is a nice way of saying a p***k) who becomes a media sensation with the help of Patricia O'Neal (who is very good in her role). Walter Matthau plays a writer on Griffith's TV show who sees through the lies of Griffith's ""persona"". Sure, Andy's a down home kind of guy on TV, but behind the scenes he's a cruel manipulator, an egomaniac, an adulterer, a thief, and an all around a*****e. Soon Andy's having dinner with important people, and starts advising candidates on how they should run their campaigns and their administrations. It's not too long after that he feels he should get a cabinet post of some kind. And he's muscling O'Neal out of her job as producer, because his ego thinks he's the greatest human being to walk the Earth. But when O'Neal has had enough of his philandering (O'Neal and Griffith have an affair during the film), she switches on the mike when the closing credits are being run for Andy's show. Andy is trashing his audience, and when they hear this, his whole career falls apart. Things haven't changed too much these days, with political candidates (on both sides) being manipulated by their handlers and by television, and how none of them seem real, because they look like they are programmed. Matthau's speech at the end of the film is one of the best closing speeches ever in a film. It's so true, so effective, and so undeniable. This film refuses to leave you off the hook at the end, and it makes for a really chilling and unforgettable experience.",5,"Shocking, intense film...hasn't dated at all....",1191974400,"10 10, 2007",2007,2016,"['one', '2', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'being', 'Waterfront', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'film', 'surpass', 'expectations', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'last', 'year', 'impact', 'someone', 'smashing', 'glass', 'face', 'powerful', 'very', 'very', 'timely', ""n't"", 'dated', 'one', 'bit', 'Kazan', 'was', 'something', 'here', 'how', 'TV', 'legitimate', 'debate', 'how', 'easily', 'manipulated', 'masses', 'can', 'be', 'medium', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'arguably', 'best', 'performance', 'troubled', 'drunk', 'nice', 'way', 'saying', 'p***k', 'who', 'media', 'sensation', 'help', 'Patricia', ""O'Neal"", 'who', 'very', 'good', 'role', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'writer', 'Griffith', 'TV', 'show', 'who', 'lies', 'Griffith', 'persona', 'Sure', 'Andy', 'down', 'home', 'kind', 'guy', 'TV', 'scenes', 'cruel', 'manipulator', 'egomaniac', 'adulterer', 'thief', 'a*****e.', 'Soon', 'Andy', 'having', 'dinner', 'important', 'people', 'advising', 'candidates', 'how', 'should', 'run', 'campaigns', 'administrations', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'should', 'get', 'cabinet', 'post', 'kind', 'muscling', ""O'Neal"", 'job', 'producer', 'ego', 'greatest', 'human', 'being', 'walk', 'Earth', 'when', ""O'Neal"", 'had', 'enough', 'philandering', ""O'Neal"", 'Griffith', 'have', 'affair', 'film', 'mike', 'when', 'closing', 'credits', 'are', 'being', 'run', 'Andy', 'show', 'Andy', 'trashing', 'audience', 'when', 'hear', 'whole', 'career', 'apart', 'Things', 'have', ""n't"", 'changed', 'too', 'much', 'days', 'political', 'candidates', 'sides', 'being', 'manipulated', 'handlers', 'television', 'how', 'none', 'seem', 'real', 'look', 'are', 'programmed', 'Matthau', 'speech', 'end', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'closing', 'speeches', 'ever', 'film', 'so', 'true', 'so', 'effective', 'so', 'undeniable', 'film', 'leave', 'off', 'hook', 'end', 'really', 'chilling', 'unforgettable', 'experience']",A Face in the Crowd VHS

This is one of those rare films that once it ended its first run, it later took on a life of its own. The story is a simple one. A young (and pretty) woman, Marcia Jeffries (played by Patricia Neal) has her own radio show on her uncle's radio station called ""A Face in the Crowd"". She totes around a large open reel tape recorder to interview people on the street. The movie begins with her going to the city's jail to see what she can get there. On the floor in a corner is a drunkard with a guitar sleeping it off (played by Andy Griffith). When she asks for him to sing a song, he asks ""What's in it for me?"". The sheriff tells him if he sings for the little lady, he'll let him out early. When he agrees, the lady introduces him as ""Lonesome Rhodes"" and he then begins to tell a tale as he stums his guitar. When she plays the tape on her show, Lonesome Rhodes becomes an overnight sensation and they run to find him, now released, to get him to agree to continue to appear on the radio, now on his own show.Rhodes popularity conitnues to skyrocket and soon, he and Marcia are soon on the road to fame and fortune. Rhodes is the star with Marcia in the shadows as not only his producer and his love interest. She is excited by him and at the same time, she sees his darker side, which is frightening to her. By the time he gets a nationally-broadcast TV show, he meets up with one of his sponsors that is simply called ""The General"" He takes Rhodes under his wing and teaches him that through his charisma, he has the power to control people via TV and Radio. He can tell them what to think and what to do, including how to vote for the General's choice to be President. Lonesome Rhodes has gone from a simple self-minded drunkard into a powerful king maker with delusions of his own grandeur. He must be destroyed and only Marcia has the power to bring him down.The film is one of the first tales about the power of radio and TV and how it can be used for good or bad. While the movie may not have seemed relevent to the movie-goers of 1957, it certainly resonates today. While Patricia Neal was a star when this film was made, it was the first film ever made by Andy Griffith and it is a powerful film that truly deserved consideration for an Academy Award. The role is totally opposite of virtually anything else Griffith took on. It reminds of the contrast between Angela Landsbury role in ""The Manchurian Candidate"" as compared to her more soft and kindly roles in movies and TV in the later years of her career.Lonesome Rhodes is one of the great all time tragic characters and its through the brilliant writing, directing, and acting that brings this fatefull character to life.

She couldn't have been more on the money. Released in 1957 and directed by the brilliant if controversial Elia Kazan, ""A Face in the Crowd"" has to be even more relevant today than then. Andy Griffith as Lonesome Rhodes, the country bumpkin spouter of cliches--""the family that prays together stays together"" is phenomenal. It is too bad that he never played this type character again but went on to be the folksy sheriff of Mayberry and later Matlock of network television. Patricia Neal as Marcia Jeffries, the woman behind Rhodes' ascension to stardom, comes off as she often does as a tough but vulnerable woman. Notice, by the way, how expressive her hands are. A very young Walter Matthau as the character who sees where Rhodes is heading is a great supporting actor as is Lee Remick, the woman Rhodes weds on an impulse after he has described baton twirling, which Remick does admirably, as ""an American art form.""The movie is about the unholy alliance with television and politics. I saw characteristics of almost every political figure I can think of in this sobering must-see film: Rhodes has a mechanical applause maker for his television shows as he advises the senator who would be president to get rid of his quite obvious comb-over and to smile more.  In today's political climate, candidates routinely hand out signs for supporters who are in line of the television cameras to hold at rallies. And presidents have focus groups to see where they should vacation. Another president carries his own luggage while boarding Airforce One to appear as one of the people. And political candidates play to our basest emotions and repeat over and over lies and half-truths. They will do anything to get elected. The candidate with the squarest jaw often gets into office. Does anyone believe for a minute that if the ex-governor of Alaska weighed 200 pounds and was five feet tall that anyone would listen to her brayings? Sadly, if Lincoln with his homely looks were alive today, he would never be elected president. It is widely believed of course that Nixon lost the race for president because he could not compete on television with the handsome and charismatic John Kennedy.This movie deserves to be resurrected or someone like Oliver Stone should do a remake of the story.",5,A Film for All Seasons,1281571200,"08 12, 2010",2010,2370,"['had', 'never', 'heard', 'film', 'friend', 'who', 'journalist', 'said', 'must', 'see', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'money', 'Released', '1957', 'directed', 'brilliant', 'controversial', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'Face', 'Crowd', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'relevant', 'today', 'then', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Lonesome', 'Rhodes', 'country', 'bumpkin', 'spouter', 'cliches', 'family', 'together', 'together', 'phenomenal', 'too', 'bad', 'never', 'played', 'type', 'character', 'again', 'went', 'be', 'folksy', 'sheriff', 'Mayberry', 'later', 'Matlock', 'network', 'television', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'Marcia', 'Jeffries', 'woman', 'Rhodes', 'ascension', 'stardom', 'off', 'often', 'tough', 'vulnerable', 'woman', 'Notice', 'way', 'how', 'expressive', 'hands', 'are', 'very', 'young', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'character', 'who', 'where', 'Rhodes', 'heading', 'great', 'supporting', 'actor', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'woman', 'Rhodes', 'weds', 'impulse', 'described', 'twirling', 'Remick', 'admirably', 'American', 'art', 'form', 'movie', 'unholy', 'alliance', 'television', 'politics', 'saw', 'characteristics', 'almost', 'political', 'figure', 'can', 'think', 'sobering', 'must-see', 'film', 'Rhodes', 'mechanical', 'applause', 'maker', 'television', 'senator', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'president', 'get', 'rid', 'quite', 'obvious', 'comb-over', 'smile', 'more', 'today', 'political', 'climate', 'candidates', 'routinely', 'hand', 'out', 'signs', 'supporters', 'who', 'are', 'line', 'television', 'cameras', 'hold', 'rallies', 'presidents', 'have', 'focus', 'groups', 'see', 'where', 'should', 'vacation', 'president', 'own', 'luggage', 'boarding', 'Airforce', 'One', 'appear', 'one', 'people', 'political', 'candidates', 'play', 'basest', 'emotions', 'repeat', 'lies', 'half-truths', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'get', 'elected', 'candidate', 'squarest', 'jaw', 'often', 'office', 'anyone', 'believe', 'minute', 'ex-governor', 'Alaska', 'weighed', '200', 'pounds', 'was', 'five', 'feet', 'tall', 'anyone', 'would', 'listen', 'brayings', 'Sadly', 'Lincoln', 'homely', 'looks', 'were', 'alive', 'today', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'elected', 'president', 'widely', 'believed', 'course', 'Nixon', 'lost', 'race', 'president', 'could', 'not', 'compete', 'television', 'handsome', 'charismatic', 'John', 'Kennedy.This', 'movie', 'be', 'resurrected', 'someone', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'should', 'do', 'remake', 'story']",A Face in the Crowd VHS

It just came in mail today.I honestly can't believe I've spent almost 38 years of a life not having seen this.  Imagine something just as powerful, vulgar and explosive as ""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" then multiply it by two.  You'll get this movie.  Patricia Neal, as always, alluring, full of bedroom eyes and that gorgeous voice, which I prefer even to Lauren Bacall for its dusky sultriness. What a woman!  She was married to Roald Dahl, you know.  My favourite photograph of the two of them was taken by Eli Wallach; quite fitting.Walter Matthau, in one of his early screen roles, tones it down, really low-key and gets the last laugh at movie's end.But, let me tell you about Andy Griffith.  I don't know whether it's his own genius, or Kazan's, but it is as good - or better - than Marlon Brando as Stanley Kowalski.  A further limb to go out on:  It's better than Robert deNiro in anything, including ""Taxi Driver"" or ""Raging Bull.""Maybe it's just coming off the drunk I had after watching this movie, downing a shot as potent as Bacardi 151, thinking it was ice water.  But, when this movie was over a lightning-quick chill ran through my blood, and my spine straightening, my neck snapping.  This was one hell of a movie, and I mean that literally, not figuratively.Who would've thunk?  Andy Taylor, Sheriff of Mayberry?  Matlock?  Yet, there he is, getting more and more vicious, lapping up the adulation, exploding into this force of populist politics.  He's every Southern snake-charmer politician and evangelist I hate -- Jerry Falwell, Newt Gingrich, Bill Clinton, Jesse Helms and Jimmy Swaggart - rolled into one.This movie comes at you from a liberal perspective, but that's not the message; the politics are immaterial.  What's important here is how a some cracker barrel homespun, seemingly innocent hick, can so easily twist politics into a vehicle for a fascist takeover of America.

He can do no wrong and events take an absurd turn as national media adopts the country boy and corrupts him with accolades and profitable bogus products.  It reaches a stunning climax where he will sit with heads of state and influence policy.  An open mike and a lose tongue lead to his downfall betrayed by his mentor.  It exposes the shallow nature of television and the fickleness of it.  A drunk rises from jail to high ratings and then crashes.  There is a lesson to be learned, but it is lost on the powers that be.  Even before the dust settles a new evangelist is being groomed to fool the people once more.

239001,AZ1UFPNARPZD2,6300273210,"Jeffrey Ellis ""bored recluse""","[121, 132]","A Face in the Crowd, director Elia Kazan's criminally underrated 1956 political melodrama, tells the all-too plausible story of Lonsome Rhodes.  Discovered by a local reporter (Patricia Neal) while spending time in a jail cell for vagrancy, Rhodes (Andy Griffith) is a drifter whose folsky charisma quickly makes him an instant celebrity.  Soon, Rhodes has taken Neal as his lover and has his own television show where he gives out his home-spun opinions to a charmed nation.  However, Rhodes is hardly the benevelolent country bumpkin that he presents himself to be.  Instead, he is a power hungry meglomaniac who uses his fame to promote a fascist political organization.  Much as he seduces a niave nation, he seduces a teenage cheerleader (Lee Remick) into being his bride.  By the time that Neal and cynical television writer Walter Matthau come to realize the monster they've helped unleash on the world, it may indeed be too late.If this film was too easily dismissed when released, it has become all the more plausible and relavent in recent years.  Certainly, the current popularity of talk radio can be seen as a fulfilment of the film's prophecy.  However, a more disturbing parallel can be made between Rhodes and the recent emergence of several political leaders whose popularity has been based less on their abilities and more on the &quot;straight-talking&quot; personalities that they skillfully display to a public disillusioned with &quot;politics-as-usual.&quot;  (Ross Perot and Jesse Ventura being just two of the more obvious examples.)Best known for working with certifiably great actors like Marlon Brando and James Dean, Elia Kazan assembled a cast for A Face in the Crowd that may appear unlikely at first.  Who could ever imagine a dark political drama starring Walter Matthau and Andy Griffith -- two seemingly polar opposites best known for their comedic efforts?  However, it is a risk that plays off beautifully.  Matthau's urban glumness stands in perfect contrast to Griffith's country-corn routine and both are such relaxing presences that even the most sophisticated of viewers will find it hard not to be drawn into a false sense of security that makes the film's ultimate revelations all the more disturbing.A Face in the Crowd was Andy Griffith's first film and he gives an amazing performance that will surprise anyone who knows Griffith only as the sheriff of Mayberry.  While still displaying his own unique charisma, Griffith also doesn't shy away from revealing -- subtly but surely -- that Lonesome Rhodes is a truly evil man.  What's now forgotten is that even as Sherif Andy Taylor, Griffith's performance had a certain edge.  If the people surrounding him were funny, Taylor was always a no-nonsense authoritarian who luckily had a good sense of humor.  In his performance as Rhodes, Griffith gives us a portrait of Andy Taylor without the sense of humor or the grounding-influence of family.  Its an amazing, all-too realistic performance that makes one wonder what Griffith could have accomplished if he'd continued to explore that edge.Though Griffith dominates the film, the supporting cast is also strong.  Along with the aforementioned Matthau, Patricia Neal gives a strong performance and brings both a subtle class snobbery and a repressed sensuality to her role.  Her scenes later in the film, when she is forced to confront what she has set loose on the world, are devastating.  Though her role is tiny, Lee Remick is both sexy and sympathetic as Griffith's child bride.  Interestingly, Kazan doesn't present her character as a total innocent.  Perhaps much like the film's America, if Remick is seduced and abused Rhodes, it is a seduction and degregation that she, at least partially, seems to desire.After naming names during the red scare, Kazan often seemed to be drifting.  Shunned by Hollywood, Kazan's films soon became obsessed with justifying his own actions.  His last two great films -- On the Waterfront and a Face in the Crowd -- both deal with the McCarthyism of the 1950s.  If Waterfront was Kazan's justification for informing, A Face in the Crowd is Kazan's attack on the men who perpatrated the Red Scare.  Rhodes becomes Kazan's horrific imagining of Joseph McCarthy.  It as if after justifying his own choice to name names, Kazan now wanted to make sure it was understood that he was still opposed to the excesses of the times.  All-in-all, its a self-centered way to view the power of cinema.  However, personal motivations aside, Kazan's need to justify himself produced at least two great films.  On the Waterfront is an acknowledged classic.  A Face in the Crowd deserves to be.",5,The Dark Side of Mayberry,1007510400,"12 5, 2001",2001,4660,"['Face', 'Crowd', 'director', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'criminally', 'underrated', '1956', 'political', 'melodrama', 'all-too', 'plausible', 'story', 'Lonsome', 'Rhodes', 'Discovered', 'local', 'reporter', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'spending', 'time', 'jail', 'cell', 'vagrancy', 'Rhodes', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'drifter', 'folsky', 'charisma', 'quickly', 'instant', 'celebrity', 'Soon', 'Rhodes', 'taken', 'Neal', 'lover', 'own', 'television', 'show', 'where', 'out', 'home-spun', 'opinions', 'charmed', 'nation', 'However', 'Rhodes', 'hardly', 'benevelolent', 'country', 'bumpkin', 'be', 'Instead', 'power', 'hungry', 'meglomaniac', 'who', 'fame', 'promote', 'fascist', 'political', 'organization', 'Much', 'niave', 'nation', 'teenage', 'cheerleader', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'being', 'bride', 'time', 'Neal', 'cynical', 'television', 'writer', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'come', 'realize', 'monster', ""'ve"", 'helped', 'unleash', 'world', 'may', 'indeed', 'be', 'too', 'late.If', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'easily', 'dismissed', 'when', 'released', 'become', 'more', 'plausible', 'relavent', 'recent', 'years', 'Certainly', 'current', 'popularity', 'talk', 'radio', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'fulfilment', 'film', 'prophecy', 'However', 'more', 'disturbing', 'parallel', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'Rhodes', 'recent', 'emergence', 'several', 'political', 'leaders', 'popularity', 'been', 'based', 'less', 'abilities', 'more', 'quot', 'straight-talking', 'quot', 'personalities', 'skillfully', 'display', 'public', 'disillusioned', 'quot', 'politics-as-usual.', 'quot', 'Ross', 'Perot', 'Jesse', 'Ventura', 'being', 'just', 'two', 'more', 'obvious', 'examples', 'Best', 'known', 'working', 'certifiably', 'great', 'actors', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'James', 'Dean', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'assembled', 'cast', 'Face', 'Crowd', 'may', 'appear', 'unlikely', 'first', 'Who', 'could', 'ever', 'imagine', 'dark', 'political', 'drama', 'starring', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'two', 'seemingly', 'polar', 'opposites', 'best', 'known', 'comedic', 'efforts', 'However', 'risk', 'beautifully', 'Matthau', 'urban', 'glumness', 'stands', 'perfect', 'contrast', 'Griffith', 'country-corn', 'routine', 'are', 'such', 'relaxing', 'presences', 'even', 'most', 'sophisticated', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'hard', 'not', 'be', 'drawn', 'false', 'sense', 'security', 'film', 'ultimate', 'revelations', 'more', 'disturbing.A', 'Face', 'Crowd', 'was', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'first', 'film', 'amazing', 'performance', 'will', 'surprise', 'anyone', 'who', 'Griffith', 'only', 'sheriff', 'Mayberry', 'still', 'displaying', 'own', 'unique', 'charisma', 'Griffith', 'also', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'revealing', 'subtly', 'surely', 'Lonesome', 'Rhodes', 'truly', 'evil', 'man', 'What', 'now', 'forgotten', 'that', 'even', 'Sherif', 'Andy', 'Taylor', 'Griffith', 'performance', 'had', 'certain', 'edge', 'people', 'surrounding', 'were', 'funny', 'Taylor', 'was', 'always', 'no-nonsense', 'authoritarian', 'who', 'luckily', 'had', 'good', 'sense', 'humor', 'performance', 'Rhodes', 'Griffith', 'portrait', 'Andy', 'Taylor', 'sense', 'humor', 'grounding-influence', 'family', 'amazing', 'all-too', 'realistic', 'performance', 'one', 'wonder', 'what', 'Griffith', 'could', 'have', 'accomplished', ""'d"", 'continued', 'explore', 'edge.Though', 'Griffith', 'film', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'strong', 'aforementioned', 'Matthau', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'strong', 'performance', 'subtle', 'class', 'snobbery', 'repressed', 'sensuality', 'role', 'scenes', 'later', 'film', 'when', 'forced', 'confront', 'what', 'set', 'loose', 'world', 'are', 'devastating', 'role', 'tiny', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'sexy', 'sympathetic', 'Griffith', 'child', 'bride', 'Interestingly', 'Kazan', ""n't"", 'present', 'character', 'total', 'innocent', 'Perhaps', 'much', 'film', 'America', 'Remick', 'seduced', 'abused', 'Rhodes', 'seduction', 'degregation', 'least', 'partially', 'desire.After', 'naming', 'names', 'red', 'scare', 'Kazan', 'often', 'seemed', 'be', 'drifting', 'Shunned', 'Hollywood', 'Kazan', 'films', 'soon', 'became', 'obsessed', 'justifying', 'own', 'actions', 'last', 'two', 'great', 'films', 'Waterfront', 'Face', 'Crowd', 'deal', 'McCarthyism', '1950s', 'Waterfront', 'was', 'Kazan', 'justification', 'informing', 'Face', 'Crowd', 'Kazan', 'attack', 'men', 'who', 'perpatrated', 'Red', 'Scare', 'Rhodes', 'Kazan', 'horrific', 'imagining', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'justifying', 'own', 'choice', 'name', 'names', 'Kazan', 'now', 'wanted', 'make', 'sure', 'was', 'understood', 'was', 'still', 'opposed', 'excesses', 'times', 'All-in-all', 'self-centered', 'way', 'view', 'power', 'cinema', 'However', 'personal', 'motivations', 'aside', 'Kazan', 'need', 'justify', 'produced', 'least', 'two', 'great', 'films', 'Waterfront', 'acknowledged', 'classic', 'Face', 'Crowd', 'be']",A Face in the Crowd VHS

239006,AZC562U18BK2S,6300273210,J. R. Trtek,"[2, 3]","A Face in the Crowd is one intriguing mix of very good and very bad, but whichever way your thumb points on this one there's really no looking away, for you're bound to discover at least one facet that will hook you. The tale of a media personality who rises from drunken obscurity to become an unrivaled performer and salesman -- and potential political kingmaker -- this film's satire is expressed not only in its substance but its style, so much so that in an odd way comparing it to other films of its time is like contrasting Citizen Kane with its contemporaries. The cinematographic is marvelous, the direction outstanding, and one can't say enough about the performances of its two co-stars, Andy Griffith and Patricia Neal. Think Heath Ledger put his stamp on the Joker? Try contemplating what Griffith did with Lonesome Rhodes. Neal, meanwhile, provides an incredible performance both quiet and intense, the perfect counterpoint to Griffith's outsized character. The satire is well-focused and razor-sharp, and prescient on a mind-blowing level. So why did I use the phrase ""very bad"" at the beginning, and why do I give this only three stars? Essentially because, for all the wonderful satire that was ahead of its time, for all of its wonderful technical excellence and despite the wonderful acting by Griffith and Neal -- and everyone else, for that matter -- the screenplay stinks in two or three glaring ways. First, the combination of satire and seriousness don't mix. They pretty much never do. The excesses of the parodies loosen the viewer's sense of reality so much that it's very hard to swing back into sober mood and feel the wrenching agony that is expressed in the relationship between Neal and Griffith. Then again, Rhodes' rise to power is too easy and pat, once more undermining the sense of reality that is a necessary bedrock for any serious emotional reaction by the audience. And, at least in my opinion, Rhodes' two-faced quality is always displayed more or less in the same limited way, with repetition piled on repetition, making the film even more simplistic. Still, all those positive aspects make me think of A Face in the Crowd as being not half empty but half full, though that may actually be half full of itself.",3,"Flawed Screenplay, Brilliant Everything Else",1355443200,"12 14, 2012",2012,2253,"['Face', 'Crowd', 'one', 'intriguing', 'mix', 'very', 'good', 'very', 'bad', 'whichever', 'way', 'thumb', 'points', 'one', 'really', 'looking', 'away', ""'re"", 'bound', 'discover', 'least', 'one', 'facet', 'will', 'hook', 'tale', 'media', 'personality', 'who', 'drunken', 'obscurity', 'become', 'unrivaled', 'performer', 'salesman', 'potential', 'political', 'kingmaker', 'film', 'satire', 'expressed', 'not', 'only', 'substance', 'style', 'so', 'much', 'odd', 'way', 'comparing', 'other', 'films', 'time', 'contrasting', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'contemporaries', 'cinematographic', 'marvelous', 'direction', 'outstanding', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'performances', 'two', 'co-stars', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'Think', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'put', 'stamp', 'Joker', 'Try', 'contemplating', 'what', 'Griffith', 'did', 'Lonesome', 'Rhodes', 'Neal', 'meanwhile', 'incredible', 'performance', 'quiet', 'intense', 'perfect', 'counterpoint', 'Griffith', 'outsized', 'character', 'satire', 'well-focused', 'razor-sharp', 'prescient', 'mind-blowing', 'level', 'So', 'why', 'did', 'use', 'phrase', 'very', 'bad', 'beginning', 'why', 'do', 'give', 'only', 'three', 'stars', 'Essentially', 'wonderful', 'satire', 'was', 'ahead', 'time', 'wonderful', 'technical', 'excellence', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'Griffith', 'Neal', 'everyone', 'else', 'matter', 'screenplay', 'stinks', 'two', 'three', 'glaring', 'ways', 'First', 'combination', 'satire', 'seriousness', 'do', ""n't"", 'mix', 'pretty', 'much', 'never', 'do', 'excesses', 'parodies', 'loosen', 'viewer', 'sense', 'reality', 'so', 'much', 'very', 'hard', 'swing', 'back', 'sober', 'mood', 'feel', 'wrenching', 'agony', 'expressed', 'relationship', 'Neal', 'Griffith', 'Then', 'again', 'Rhodes', 'rise', 'power', 'too', 'easy', 'pat', 'once', 'more', 'undermining', 'sense', 'reality', 'necessary', 'bedrock', 'serious', 'emotional', 'reaction', 'audience', 'least', 'opinion', 'Rhodes', 'two-faced', 'quality', 'always', 'displayed', 'more', 'less', 'same', 'limited', 'way', 'repetition', 'piled', 'repetition', 'making', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'simplistic', 'Still', 'positive', 'aspects', 'make', 'think', 'Face', 'Crowd', 'being', 'not', 'empty', 'half', 'full', 'may', 'actually', 'be', 'half', 'full']",A Face in the Crowd VHS

This has been one of my faves since first seeing it (too) long ago. Well, it is more relevant than ever and should be seen be everyone (literally)!! I notice some (likely younger) folks mentioned comparisons to some politicians, but indeed Lonesome Rhodes was based on the phenomenally successful (and notoriously haughty) radio & early TV host Arthur Godfrey. Yes, Godfrey discovered Julius La Rosa, but La Rosa probably got fired for asking for a raise (after becoming very popular, both on the show and solo records). Apparently Arthur, like Lawrence Welk, was a cheap prick who only paid scale -- no matter what the tenure or how successful were his performers.""A Face In the Crowd"" was most definitely social commentary, NOT satire; although, as one from that era, I can understand why it seemed so to many at the time. It's apparent why it inspired so many future talents! That this film was not nominated on its own merits due to political differences/grudges is a GD crime!!!  Can't say why Andy Griffith wasn't, but he sure deserved it... Awesome!! So awesome, it actually effected his personal life.Anyway, re: politicians, ""A Face In the Crowd"" was a prescient warning of the dangers of that new media (TV), thus akin to those who subsequently capitalized on its propaganda potential and the *science* of people's weakness of mistaking ""image"" for truth!But Kazan was not simply a great director; he was perhaps the most socially conscious of all Hollywood directors!! And he was one of the greatest actors' directors; hence, one reason why you never saw an Andy Griffith act like this in film again! (The DVD also has an excellent up-to-date documentary about the making of AFITC and its genesis, with many pertinent historical tidbits re: Kazan.)In just 21 films, Kazan directed at least 10 GREAT films:""America, America"" (1963), ""Wild River"" (1960), ""Baby Doll"" (1956), ""East of Eden"" (1955), ""On the Waterfront"" (1954), ""Viva Zapata!"" (1952), ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" (1951), ""Panic in the Streets"" (1950), ""Gentleman's Agreement"" (1947), and ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"" (1945).In his films, 21 different actors had Oscar-nominated performances: James Dunn, Celeste Holm, Gregory Peck, Dorothy McGuire, Anne Revere, Jeanne Crain, Ethel Barrymore, Ethel Waters, Karl Malden, Vivien Leigh, Kim Hunter, Marlon Brando, Anthony Quinn, Eva Marie Saint, Lee J. Cobb, Rod Steiger, Jo Van Fleet, James Dean, Carroll Baker, Mildred Dunnock, and Natalie Wood -- of which Dunn, Holm, Malden, Leigh, Hunter, Quinn, Brando, Saint and Van Fleet ALL won Oscars for their performances in one of Kazan's movies.Not too shabby, eh!?",5,One of the Greatest of ALL films....,1116460800,"05 19, 2005",2005,2737,"['Having', 'read', 'others', 'comments', 'here', 'IMDB', 'having', 'just', 'watched', 'new', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'add', 'two', 'cents', 'been', 'one', 'faves', 'first', 'seeing', 'too', 'long', 'ago', 'Well', 'more', 'relevant', 'ever', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'everyone', 'literally', 'notice', 'likely', 'younger', 'folks', 'mentioned', 'comparisons', 'politicians', 'indeed', 'Lonesome', 'Rhodes', 'was', 'based', 'phenomenally', 'successful', 'notoriously', 'haughty', 'radio', 'early', 'TV', 'host', 'Arthur', 'Godfrey', 'Yes', 'Godfrey', 'discovered', 'Julius', 'La', 'Rosa', 'La', 'Rosa', 'probably', 'got', 'fired', 'asking', 'raise', 'becoming', 'very', 'popular', 'show', 'solo', 'records', 'Apparently', 'Arthur', 'Lawrence', 'Welk', 'was', 'cheap', 'prick', 'who', 'only', 'paid', 'scale', 'matter', 'what', 'tenure', 'how', 'successful', 'were', 'performers', 'Face', 'Crowd', 'was', 'most', 'definitely', 'social', 'commentary', 'NOT', 'satire', 'one', 'era', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'seemed', 'so', 'many', 'time', 'apparent', 'why', 'inspired', 'so', 'many', 'future', 'talents', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'nominated', 'own', 'merits', 'due', 'political', 'differences/grudges', 'GD', 'crime', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'why', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'deserved', 'Awesome', 'So', 'awesome', 'actually', 'effected', 'personal', 'life.Anyway', 're', 'politicians', 'Face', 'Crowd', 'was', 'prescient', 'warning', 'dangers', 'new', 'media', 'TV', 'thus', 'akin', 'who', 'subsequently', 'capitalized', 'propaganda', 'potential', '*science*', 'people', 'weakness', 'mistaking', 'image', 'truth', 'Kazan', 'was', 'not', 'simply', 'great', 'director', 'was', 'perhaps', 'most', 'socially', 'conscious', 'Hollywood', 'directors', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'directors', 'hence', 'one', 'reason', 'why', 'never', 'saw', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'act', 'film', 'again', 'DVD', 'also', 'excellent', 'up-to-date', 'documentary', 'making', 'AFITC', 'genesis', 'many', 'pertinent', 'historical', 'tidbits', 're', 'Kazan', 'just', '21', 'films', 'Kazan', 'directed', 'least', '10', 'GREAT', 'films', 'America', 'America', '1963', 'Wild', 'River', '1960', 'Baby', 'Doll', '1956', 'East', 'Eden', '1955', 'Waterfront', '1954', 'Viva', 'Zapata', '1952', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', '1951', 'Panic', 'Streets', '1950', 'Gentleman', 'Agreement', '1947', 'A', 'Tree', 'Grows', 'Brooklyn', '1945', '.In', 'films', '21', 'different', 'actors', 'had', 'Oscar-nominated', 'performances', 'James', 'Dunn', 'Celeste', 'Holm', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Dorothy', 'McGuire', 'Anne', 'Revere', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'Ethel', 'Barrymore', 'Ethel', 'Waters', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'Vivien', 'Leigh', 'Kim', 'Hunter', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'Lee', 'J.', 'Cobb', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'Jo', 'Van', 'Fleet', 'James', 'Dean', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'Mildred', 'Dunnock', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'Dunn', 'Holm', 'Malden', 'Leigh', 'Hunter', 'Quinn', 'Brando', 'Saint', 'Van', 'Fleet', 'ALL', 'won', 'Oscars', 'performances', 'one', 'Kazan', 'movies.Not', 'too', 'shabby', 'eh']",A Face in the Crowd VHS

She calls it ""A Face in the Crowd"" because she believes she can coax ""talent"" from anyone.One day she goes to the county jail for that face which, it turns out, belongs to Larry Rhodes. He speaks right up and says, ""What's in it for me?,"" a phrase that becomes his magic words. She gives him the luminous name Lonesome Rhodes and puts him on her morning show where he becomes an immediate local hit. Here on radio he proves he can get people to do outrageous things just by asking. Lonesome has the stuff, star quality, and becomes a radio personality. No need of wands for Lonesome--he has his own magic: the raw vitality of animal magnetism even sight unseen.Before long Marcia and Lonesome go to Memphis for his own television show.On their way there, she learns he is really a warty toad inside that Prince Charming disguise, but as a princess is wont to do, she ignores it. In Memphis Lonesome is growing in influence and growing to fit inside that influence. He brings a black woman off the streets and asks the television audience to help raise money to rebuild her burned down house. More than enough money is raised. It's a magic kingdom, television is, with all kinds of far-reaching influence.Lonesome proves he can sell anything his way-- by belittling the product or boosting the product. He becomes a ""wielder of opinion, a man of influence, a strong hand of the elite to guide the masses,"" and is backed by a maker of presidents. At this point the toad has shed that skin to become a troll.Meanwhile, what has happened to Princess Marcia? Who is the real knight who comes to the rescue? And what happens to that troll?""A Face in the Crowd"" is one of the most overlooked films about media manipulation, misuse and abuse of the power of mass appeal by a television personality, a dark look at behind-the-scenes television.

And it has been said that Griffith swore to never play a similar role again, as some of the his characters personality spilled over into his home life. What a loss for us, but what proof that he was one incredible actor AND one incredible person. I get so tired of hearing that Brando was the greatest actor of his generation. It's just not true and man does Griffith make that clear, although I am sure that wasn't his goal, in this movie. Besides, do people forget the name Bette Davis, or Lawrence Olivier or Claude Reines.

239014,A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK,6300273210,"Kurt Harding ""bon vivant""","[5, 5]","My image of Andy Griffith as and actor and as a person has always been positive. I don't know him, he may be the biggest jerk in the world for all I know, but he has managed his public image well and has kept his name unsullied by sordid rumors, so I have always liked him.If your image of Griffith is the same, and you have never seen this movie, brace yourself for the cognitive dissonance you will feel when you watch this! Griffith turns in a powerful performance as a hobo troubador who is ""discovered"" by a small-town radio host while in jail and then uses the opportunities that unfold to rocket to fame as a canny, folksy and cynical television entertainer and pundit.My take after watching the movie is that Griffith's character, Larry ""Lonesome"" Rhodes, was always self-centered but was quite the ladies man as well. He found with Patricia Neal's help that he could use his folksy manner to get what he wanted. He also found that simple folks fell for and identified with his cornpone stories. But it was his handlers who led him to believe his own press and that his insight was indispensable in every situation.Kazan and Schulburg use the movie as a vehicle to show not only how television could be misused in politics, but also in advertising. With Rhodes as its spokesman, sales of  a worthless energy pill soared and so Rhodes became a sought-after spinmeister in other areas as well. Television does for Rhodes what radio did for the real-life folksy musician/politician Pappy O'Daniel.On the romantic side, Rhodes was a real skirt-chaser, full of promises but always with his eye out for his next conquest. His come-uppance came when he jilted the woman who had helped bring him to his great heights for the charms of a groupie-like baton-twirling teenager (Lee Remick) he met when a judge at a twirling contest. The cliche is that ""hell hath no fury..."", and the jilted Patricia Neal lost no time in conspiring to bring him down. She got her chance when she burst in to the studio and aired for the nation to hear all of Griffith's contemptuous comments about his fan base to the bunch of ""hayseeds"" he used as a focus group on his show. That put a quick end to his popularity and the ranting,raving ending is really something to witness! It is left to the viewer's imagination as to whether Griffith follows through on his threat to jump from his office tower if Neal leaves him.I never heard of this movie until recently and bought it on the strength of a recommendation.

He went on to endear himself to millions on The Andy Griffith Show and Matlock-- the folksy but wise nice guy. While I was watching A Face In The Crowd for the first time (it took me until age 40 before I discovered this film), I felt numbed, my emotions felt...BLASTED. I told my husband that I didn't think I could ever watch Matlock again-- how could this towering terror have ""sold out"" by playing the nice guy the rest of his life? How DARE he deprive his audience of the power he so obviously was able to bring to the screen? I was perplexed, even angry-- what happened?Now that I've heard the story of why his career took the path it did, I can watch his other work, smile, and appreciate it all the more. Because it's OK; they caught lightning in a bottle with this one. Most actors go their entire lives without leaving this kind of legacy.I'd never seen Patricia Neal play her emotions this raw, either. The HOWL she lets out when she throws herself across the console to keep Rhodes on the air...Kazan had a way of really wringing his actors.I won't go into any synopsis or further analysis; other reviewers have done just fine on that count. However, I am dumbfounded that this film is NOT on DVD, was NOT nominated for a single Academy Award; while I suppose the latter can be explained away by the politics of the times, it doesn't explain why Wiley and Bona's otherwise exhaustive tome ""Inside Oscar"" doesn't even MENTION the film as having made an impact.

The movie chronicles the rise to fame and ultimate destruction of a down-and-out Arkansas man who rises to power on the appeal of his folksy charm and home-spun philosophy, which find a responsive chord in his audience. At first ostensibly a champion of the common man, he eventually comes to despise the audience who has brought him so much fame and power and influence.Griffith plays the role with so much energy and intensity that one critic (Bosley Crowther of the New York Times) commented that he basically overwhelmed the entire cast and story, and would have preferred a more balanced movie. In fact Griffith said he would never play another role like it as he admitted it even affected his personal life and family.Griffith's character of Lonesone Rhodes may have been partly inspired by Arthur Godfrey, one of the leading radio and TV personalities of the day, who was known to ridicule the products and ad copy of his sponsors and writers--as Griffith does in the movie. When Godfrey on the air fired singer Julius La Rosa, who he had discovered and brought to fame (La Rosa eventually receiving more than 7000 fan letters a week, more than Godfrey himself), it also brought to light the less pleasant aspects of Godfrey's personality.Coincidentally, seeing Godfrey on TV in the 50s is one of my earliest memories of watching TV and I especially recall a morning news program where he would emerge from a helicopter to start his broadcast.But getting back to Griffith, eventually the power corrupts Griffith who even begins to abuse his friends and colleagues, many of whom have been quite loyal and have worked hard for him behind the scenes during his rise to fame and power. ""A Face in the Crowd"" is a trenchant morality tale of the corrupting influence of raw power, told especially from the standpoint of its effect on the cult personality's innermost circle.",4,High-voltage role for Griffith,1351641600,"10 31, 2012",2012,2175,"['Please', 'note', 'saw', 'movie', 'channel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'quality', 'DVD', 'release', 'features.Although', 'went', 'play', 'nice', 'guy', 'roles', 'rest', 'career', 'Face', 'Crowd', 'sealed', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'reputation', 'considerable', 'acting', 'talent', 'late', '50s', 'movie', 'rise', 'fame', 'ultimate', 'destruction', 'down-and-out', 'Arkansas', 'man', 'who', 'power', 'appeal', 'folksy', 'charm', 'home-spun', 'philosophy', 'find', 'responsive', 'chord', 'audience', 'first', 'ostensibly', 'champion', 'common', 'man', 'eventually', 'despise', 'audience', 'who', 'brought', 'so', 'much', 'fame', 'power', 'influence.Griffith', 'role', 'so', 'much', 'energy', 'intensity', 'one', 'critic', 'Bosley', 'Crowther', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'commented', 'basically', 'overwhelmed', 'entire', 'cast', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'more', 'balanced', 'movie', 'fact', 'Griffith', 'said', 'would', 'never', 'play', 'role', 'admitted', 'even', 'affected', 'personal', 'life', 'family.Griffith', 'character', 'Lonesone', 'Rhodes', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'partly', 'inspired', 'Arthur', 'Godfrey', 'one', 'leading', 'radio', 'TV', 'personalities', 'day', 'who', 'was', 'known', 'ridicule', 'products', 'ad', 'copy', 'sponsors', 'writers', 'Griffith', 'movie', 'When', 'Godfrey', 'air', 'fired', 'singer', 'Julius', 'La', 'Rosa', 'who', 'had', 'discovered', 'brought', 'fame', 'La', 'Rosa', 'eventually', 'receiving', 'more', '7000', 'fan', 'letters', 'week', 'more', 'Godfrey', 'also', 'brought', 'light', 'less', 'pleasant', 'aspects', 'Godfrey', 'personality.Coincidentally', 'seeing', 'Godfrey', 'TV', '50s', 'one', 'earliest', 'memories', 'watching', 'TV', 'especially', 'recall', 'morning', 'news', 'program', 'where', 'would', 'emerge', 'helicopter', 'start', 'broadcast.But', 'getting', 'back', 'Griffith', 'eventually', 'power', 'corrupts', 'Griffith', 'who', 'even', 'abuse', 'friends', 'colleagues', 'many', 'whom', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'loyal', 'have', 'worked', 'hard', 'scenes', 'rise', 'fame', 'power', 'Face', 'Crowd', 'trenchant', 'morality', 'tale', 'corrupting', 'influence', 'raw', 'power', 'told', 'especially', 'standpoint', 'effect', 'cult', 'personality', 'innermost', 'circle']",A Face in the Crowd VHS

Director Elia Kazan presents a disturbing image of America.  Kazan's America is peopled either by fools who can be manipulated like lemmings to run off a cliff or by aw-shuckin' Pied Pipers who lead them off, laughing all the while at their naivete.  Andy Griffith, in his role of a lifetime, plays Lonesome Rhodes, a low-class, conman wannabe whom Patricia Neal finds quite by accident in a local lockup.  She hears his country accent and is conquered by his homespun philosophy that seems to say a great deal but is all smoke and mirrors.  Rhodes is a verbal snapping turtle, waiting for his One Big Chance and in Neal, he finds it. She puts him on a radio show, where for the first time, his target audience now numbers in the thousands.  As he speaks into the mike, the audience listening on the radio and the audience watching him on their VCR can hear the power of his voice, exhorting them to become his camp followers.  Paradoxically, neither audience seems willing or able to look behind the smiling mask or hear past the barrage of corn to notice the evil that just now has found an outlet.  Walter Matthau and Tony Franciosa have superb minor roles who grease the skids for Rhodes, who increasingly is seen as a collective future composite of television and radio hosts so common today.  Rhodes, having conquered radio, now switches to television, reaching out to a national audience that is pictured as nothing less than suckers waiting to be fleeced.  Rhodes does not believe in looking back.  His focus is always on the new, the formerly unobtainable.  After he begins an affair with Neal, he has no problems dumping her for a sexy teenage cheerleader, played by Lee Remick, who pompoms both briefly and sensually.  Neal is determined to destroy Rhodes and she does so by allowing America to see the loathsomeness of Rhodes behind the mask and to hear the bitter ugly truth that pours from his lips.  It is only then that America wises up to the manipulator that very nearly became the power behind the presidential throne.A FACE IN THE CROWD is a truly gripping tale that is also hurtful to watch.  As you see and hear Lonesome Rhodes glide through the nation's mass media to become nothing less than a total pop icon, you can see that the difference between a country run by legitimate leaders or one run by a master manipulator is so slight that a spurned heart may be all that separates what Rhodes reached out to grab but missed only by the slightest of margins.",5,A Face in a Crowd of Fools,1027382400,"07 23, 2002",2002,2579,"['FACE', 'IN', 'THE', 'CROWD', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'revelatory', 'films', 'never', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Director', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'disturbing', 'image', 'America', 'Kazan', 'America', 'peopled', 'either', 'fools', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'manipulated', 'lemmings', 'run', 'off', 'cliff', 'aw-shuckin', 'Pied', 'Pipers', 'who', 'lead', 'off', 'laughing', 'while', 'naivete', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'role', 'lifetime', 'Lonesome', 'Rhodes', 'low-class', 'conman', 'wannabe', 'whom', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'quite', 'accident', 'local', 'lockup', 'country', 'accent', 'conquered', 'homespun', 'philosophy', 'say', 'great', 'deal', 'smoke', 'mirrors', 'Rhodes', 'verbal', 'snapping', 'turtle', 'waiting', 'One', 'Big', 'Chance', 'Neal', 'radio', 'show', 'where', 'first', 'time', 'target', 'audience', 'now', 'numbers', 'thousands', 'mike', 'audience', 'listening', 'radio', 'audience', 'watching', 'VCR', 'can', 'hear', 'power', 'voice', 'exhorting', 'become', 'camp', 'followers', 'Paradoxically', 'audience', 'willing', 'able', 'look', 'smiling', 'mask', 'hear', 'barrage', 'corn', 'notice', 'evil', 'just', 'now', 'found', 'outlet', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'Tony', 'Franciosa', 'have', 'superb', 'minor', 'roles', 'who', 'grease', 'skids', 'Rhodes', 'who', 'increasingly', 'seen', 'collective', 'future', 'composite', 'television', 'radio', 'hosts', 'so', 'common', 'today', 'Rhodes', 'having', 'conquered', 'radio', 'now', 'television', 'reaching', 'out', 'national', 'audience', 'pictured', 'nothing', 'less', 'suckers', 'waiting', 'be', 'fleeced', 'Rhodes', 'not', 'believe', 'looking', 'back', 'focus', 'always', 'new', 'formerly', 'unobtainable', 'affair', 'Neal', 'problems', 'dumping', 'sexy', 'teenage', 'cheerleader', 'played', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'who', 'briefly', 'sensually', 'Neal', 'determined', 'destroy', 'Rhodes', 'so', 'allowing', 'America', 'see', 'loathsomeness', 'Rhodes', 'mask', 'hear', 'bitter', 'ugly', 'truth', 'pours', 'lips', 'only', 'then', 'America', 'manipulator', 'very', 'nearly', 'became', 'power', 'presidential', 'throne.A', 'FACE', 'IN', 'THE', 'CROWD', 'truly', 'gripping', 'tale', 'also', 'hurtful', 'watch', 'see', 'hear', 'Lonesome', 'Rhodes', 'glide', 'nation', 'mass', 'media', 'become', 'nothing', 'less', 'total', 'pop', 'icon', 'can', 'see', 'difference', 'country', 'run', 'legitimate', 'leaders', 'one', 'run', 'master', 'manipulator', 'so', 'slight', 'spurned', 'heart', 'may', 'be', 'what', 'Rhodes', 'reached', 'out', 'grab', 'missed', 'only', 'slightest', 'margins']",A Face in the Crowd VHS

239026,A24GLNOGCWICTP,6300273210,Neil Cotiaux,"[5, 5]","Occasionally, the world of cinema is blessed with a work that not only comments on an emerging issue of its time but also forecasts with target precision the potential ramifications of that issue on society at large for decades to come. ""A Face in the Crowd"" is such a groundbreaking film, the magnificence of its message brought alive by the two spellbinding, Oscar-worthy performances of Andy Griffith, making his film debut, and Patricia Neal, already a highly respected actress, who are given equal billing in the opening credits of this 1958 release.Almost nonstop and for more than two hours, Andy Griffith chews up everything in his path as Lonesome Rhodes, a drifter with the gifts of gab and song and an uncanny ability to tell his audience what it wants to hear - whatever he thinks privately. With a maniacal laugh and take-no-prisoners approach aimed at whomever he is trying to win over, Rhodes is the antithesis of the straight-arrow good ole' boy that Griffith would portray with astounding success on the tube just several years later. First-time viewers of this film will know immediately they're Not In Mayberry Anymore when, instead of popping a Ritz cracker into his mouth and breaking into a smarmy grin, Rhodes takes a belt from a whiskey bottle and sneers as he manhandles his guitar in the jailhouse - or when he leers malevolently at a baton twirler's calves during a mass adulation in the town in which he was ""discovered"". In less capable dramatic hands, Griffith's reading of the Rhodes character could easily have become repetitive and headache inducing, but in Griffith's roundhouse performance, the viewer is left spellbound, almost hypnotized by one of the most overlooked performances in American cinema.The casting of Patricia Neal as the radio producer who innocently christens Rhodes ""Lonesome"" and sets America on a course of idol worship was truly inspired. Her soft-spoken drawl, doe-eyed look of innocence and fear of getting too close to Rhodes' crackling bonfire of sexual energy serve as the perfect counterpoint to Griffith's rip-snortin' persona. Neal is the only performer in ""Crowd"" that holds her own against Griffith's mesmerizing presence.In terms of its message, ""Crowd"", adroitly written by Budd Schulberg (who the credits say also co-wrote the songs Griffith performs), tells us that anyone with talent or the right stage presence can be packaged at convenience for mass consumption - so long as the packagers have the final say. It's all about the Sponsor, Stupid, even at the local radio station whose manager plays hard-to-get with an advertiser smitten by Rhodes' unctuous charm, and the stakes only grow larger when Rhodes moves to Memphis, then New York. ""Crowd"" debuted when Madison Avenue was starting to perfect the psychological advertising techniques first exposed in Vance Packard's ""The Hidden Persuaders"" (published during the year this film was shot), and ""Crowd"" both deprecates and warns against these techniques. Make no mistake, ""Crowd"" says, the media is all about money, and few who toil in its hallways will have the backbone to take a stand against self-interest in taming the media in order to have its celebrities use their powers responsibly. For Rhodes, the black woman he ushers on-camera or the boy in the wheelchair are simply props that help perpetuate both his ratings and his sinister influence, and when he decides to escalate to the next level with a demogogic senator, the best his writer can do is sit down and try to dash off an expose. Even Neal's character briefly succumbs to the promise of a payoff when bad-boy Rhodes realizes she's mad as hell and won't take it any more. And when the ""next"" Lonesome Rhodes is discovered, there are all too many industry players ready to take up his cause... and cash in.In the end, ""Crowd"" can be viewed as warning that we may never see the last of the Joseph McCarthys, but that only until things become too ""hot"" under the kleig light will media titans pull the plug. It's the Sponsor, Stupid, as attested to in real life by Edward R. Murrow, the Smothers Brothers and Don Imus.Hell Hath No Fury Like an Advertiser Scorned.

But if you were to ask me, my answer is ""A Face in the Crowd."" Were it not for the fact that Kazan was ""blacklisted"" by the Hollywood liberal elite for his supposed testimony (in which he named only those who were already named by others), this film might have swept the Academy Awards. As it was the film was virtually ignored -- Andy Griffith, who gave the performance of a lifetime, was not even nominated for Best Actor, and his performance h0olds up to this day.As to this classic making its debut on DVD, all I can say is It's About Time.The film also marked the debuts of three talented actors that left their marks on film and television: Tony Franciosa, Walter Matthau, and Lee Remick.But what makes this movie so great to watch again and again is that its subject matter never goes out of date, based as it is on the power of television to manipulate and control the minds of viewers. Griffith stars as Larry Rhodes, a drifter awoken one morning in the local jail by Patricia Neal, who is looking for subjects for her morning radio show, ""A Face in the Crowd."" Assured by the sheriff that he'll be released if he performs, Rhodes grabs his guitar and puts on a show that lands him a regular job on Neal's radio show. Now known as ""Lonesome"" Rhodes, his combination of homespun philosopher-entertainer quickly takes him from Arkansas to Memphis, where he meets Joey DePalma (Tony Franciosa), an aspiring agent who lands him a network deal in New York. Walter Matthau goes along as the head writer who stays on for the pay despite being mocked by Rhodes. Neal also comes with her prot&eacute;g&eacute;, for not only is she his manager, she is also his lover. (The movie's sub-text deals with the love Neal has for the Frankenstein monster she created, despite what he does to her time after time.) Her reaction when she finds out at the airport that her intended Lonesome has married a cheerleader (Remick) is one of the finest pieces of acting in the history of film.Brought to New York to pitch a worthless product call Vitajex on a variety show, Rhodes makes both the product and himself the biggest things since sliced bread. There is a hilarious sequence of a bout three minutes during this scene of how Madison Avenue can manipulate the public into believing a worthless product is actually good for you. People I've shown this to sit there with mouths agape, dazzled by sophistication rarely encountered in the movies.Rhodes now comes to the attention of the product's sponsor, who convinces him that not only is Rhodes an opinion maker, but that his untapped power should be used to make a Senate nonentity named J. Worthington Fuller into a viable presidential candidate. Rhodes takes the challenge, renaming the Senator ""Curly"" Fuller and featuring him on his new show, ""Lonesome Rhodes' Cracker Barrel,"" a sort of down home ""McLaughlin Group."" By this time, Rhodes's megalomania is completely out of control; his price for Fuller is a cabinet post as Secretary for National Morale. And he almost gets away with it, until Neal pulls the plug in a most unique manner.It is left to Walter Matthau to deliver the epilogue: we have not seen the last of Lonesome Rhodes. He'll be back, with others just like him; a chilling prediction only too well borne out by subsequent events.It's a shame this classic hasn't received more attention than it has. The message is timeless, the acting and direction flawless. There has been talk of a remake, but let's hope this doesn't come to fruition.

This is NOT the same character.  There is a brilliant mind behind the easy-going ""ah shucks"" delivery in each of the characters.  However, the sheriff always does the right thing, while Lonesome the drifter seems to always do the wrong thing.  Yet if you're a fan of the actor, Andy Griffith, you can't miss this movie; it's his best acting role bar none.What makes ""A Face in the Crowd"" so impressive is its' foresight in understanding media, politics, and the ability of one to manipulate the other.  After all, this movie was made in the mid-50's when the power of TV was little understood or appreciated.  It may well have gotten reviews that ridiculed its' premise when it was released.  Yet, seen today, it is an amazing study of how one man, with a willing media accomplice, can control public opinion.

Griiffith stars as the boorish, seemingly innocent, sociopath named Larry ""Lonesome"" Rhodes who quickly becomes the most popular man in America. Marcia Jefferies (Patricia Neal), who hosts a radio show called ""Face in The Crowd"", discovers Rhodes in a prison in Alabama and convinces him to appear regularly after recording and broadcasting his humorous antecdotes and songs. His popularity sky-rockets in the state in a short amount of time and one day, after pulling a public prank on the local sheriff with the help of his listeners, Marcia asks him how it feels to sway people to do his bidding and breifly, but calmly, realizes that he can. As the film progresses, The ""Good ole boy"" starts to reveal his true colors; Particularly when he becomes very close to his primary tv show sponsor who wants to see a senator in the oval office. The sponsor and senator appoint him to become an un-official ""image consultant"" and his ego grows to an all time by starting a new show which is the equivalent of today's political pundit shows but just not ashamed of being light-hearted entertainment. Mad with power he one night confesses to Marcia how truely feels about his audience, they are stupid sheep who he will manipulate to vote for the senator into the whitehouse and as a result he would be given a position of ""Secretary for National Morale""; The very backbone of the president's power. I won't spoil the ending because it's just good. Andy Griffith was terrific as this maniac who may be a country bumpkin but he knew the power of entertainment and the power of words and naturally gets drunk off this power; Twisting and turning not only his ""sheep"" but his closer friends. He's a user in the strongest sense of the word and truly a sheep in wolves clothing.

It's more than a little over the top, and the special on the dvd (`Facing the Past') leads you to believe that's more or less the way director Elia Kazan wanted it.  If `Lonesome' Rhodes is all surface noise, Marcia Jeffries (Patricia Neal) embodies quiet depth.  She's the most complex character in the screenplay, one who has to go from smoldering lovelorn frustration to confusion to pity and points beyond.  Fortunately, Patricia Neal is one of the best screen actresses ever, one who is able to communicate more with one reaction shot than most actors can with a page of dialogue. Walter Matthau plays writer Mel Miller, a wryly detached cynic who, it's hinted at, carries a torch for Marcia and also carries the point-of-view of the audience.  Miller is `Lonesome' Rhodes lead writer, a job that will lead him to write an expos&eacute; book entitled `Demagogue in Denim.'  If the audience is able to sneer through the Walter Matthau character, we feel through Marcia Jeffries.  Neal is the anchor of this project.It's Matthau's Miller, though, who voices one of the core messages of this movie - ""You gotta be a saint to stand all the power that little box (television) can give you."" A saint Rhodes ain't.  In fact, he's cast more like a classic movie monster, this time decked out in cowboy hat and denim jeans rather than neck bolts and elevator boots. If Griffith plays The Monster, Marcia is Victor Frankenstein, the one with the strongest ties to this abomination, the one who can still mourn amid the rubble that follows in the wake of `Lonesome' Rhodes meteoric rise.The monster he becomes is one born of the media, nursed in radio and nurtured by television, abetted by businessmen who appreciate his ability to sell product and courted by politicians who demean themselves to bask in his reflected glow.  A FACE IN THE CROWD is probably the first great critique of television by Hollywood.  Although dated and a little corny today, as opposed to the outlandish and improbable label it held when it was made, it sure proved prophetic.  Within a decade people would be writing about how politicians were sold like dish soap and detailing television's insidious and central role in the process.  It's an insight that we're grown used to, almost bored with, but Kazan and screenwriter Budd Schulberg deserve homesteaders credit on this one.  They were the first to give voice to what they saw as a subversion of democracy, and for that they deserve rich credit.Oddly, there's no commentary track on this one.

Cooper ""Scolopendra""","[0, 0]","Originally conceived as a warning of what was to come--the confluence of politics, business, and entertainment all through the sights and sounds of television--/A Face In The Crowd/ was originally brushed off by critics and viewers in the 1950s because ""it wasn't realistic"" (plus some Hollywood politics and reverse blacklisting probably didn't help).  Nowadays, this movie is heralded as being prophetic, and in the commentary the screenwriter talks about how he's stopped in the street and told how great this movie is because it describes how things are -now-.  The most backhanded compliment one can give to a prophet is to ignore him and then tell him he's right.Andy Griffith is /excellent/ as a nihilistic conman looking for number one, perhaps too much so.  Mr. Griffith claims in his interview that he got far too deep into character, and that's probably why ever since he's played good old Mayberry sheriffs--he's essentially a good man who's seen what bad men are, and he's shied away from it.  I can respect him for that.  I'll just go on the record as saying that his performance here is so good, so visceral, so -real- that he would've had a hard time topping it as a dramatic actor, and indeed his later history as a 'welcome friend in the TV' only gives this movie just that much more power.",5,Ironically Prophetic,1213228800,"06 12, 2008",2008,1308,"['Originally', 'conceived', 'warning', 'what', 'was', 'come', 'confluence', 'politics', 'business', 'entertainment', 'sights', 'sounds', 'television', '/A', 'Face', 'Crowd/', 'was', 'originally', 'brushed', 'off', 'critics', 'viewers', '1950s', 'was', ""n't"", 'realistic', 'Hollywood', 'politics', 'reverse', 'blacklisting', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'Nowadays', 'movie', 'heralded', 'being', 'prophetic', 'commentary', 'screenwriter', 'talks', 'how', 'stopped', 'street', 'told', 'how', 'great', 'movie', 'how', 'things', 'are', '-now-', 'most', 'backhanded', 'compliment', 'one', 'can', 'give', 'prophet', 'ignore', 'then', 'tell', 'right.Andy', 'Griffith', '/excellent/', 'nihilistic', 'conman', 'looking', 'number', 'one', 'perhaps', 'too', 'much', 'so', 'Mr.', 'Griffith', 'interview', 'got', 'far', 'too', 'deep', 'character', 'probably', 'why', 'ever', 'played', 'good', 'old', 'Mayberry', 'sheriffs', 'essentially', 'good', 'man', 'who', 'seen', 'what', 'bad', 'men', 'are', 'shied', 'away', 'can', 'respect', ""'ll"", 'just', 'go', 'record', 'saying', 'performance', 'here', 'so', 'good', 'so', 'visceral', 'so', '-real-', 'would', ""'ve"", 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'topping', 'dramatic', 'actor', 'indeed', 'later', 'history', ""'welcome"", 'friend', 'TV', 'only', 'movie', 'just', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'power']",A Face in the Crowd VHS
239044,AJYGQV81FSFE2,6300273210,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[6, 10]","I wasn't terribly familiar with the work of director Elia Kazan until he was stood up during an Academy Awards presentation a few years ago. It seemed he'd rather gutlessly turned in some members of the Communist Party during the McCarthy era and Hollywood still resented him for it.After these years have gone by, I heard a newsman whose work I like refer to ""Lonesome Rhodes"" Beck, for Glenn Beck, the popular commentator. I wasn't sure who Lonesome Rhodes was until I readCommon Nonsense: Glenn Beck and the Triumph of Ignorance. In that fine book I learned of the film and was fortunate to have gotten it from Amazon.com.I've always been impressed with Andy Griffith. My parents had a comedy album by him back in the 1950s. And who can forget the Andy Griffith show, as American an institution as Leave it to Beaver and other light classics. Later I saw him in a movie or two in which I thought he was quite good. Well, this film was done before he even did that old television series! Until this film, he'd only done stage acting, in ""No Time for Seargents"" on Broadway.I'll do my best to not give anything away while describing it. Marcia Jeffries (Patricia Neal, whom you may remember from the originalThe Day the Earth Stood Still, a local radio show host in I think Arkansas, has a Man on the Street type show called ""A Face in the Crowd."" She decides to broadcast from the local jail where there's a smartalek drifter Larry Rhodes getting over a bender from the night before. She refers to him as ""Lonesome Rhodes"" and the story begins. Rhodes has a charm to beat the band. While he wants to drift, the radio show wants him on full time. He continues to charm.Rhodes truly does move up the ranks. He gets offers in bigger cities. The script was ahead of itself in that Rhodes had an appeal to a black audience which a producer, portrayed masterfully by Walter Matthaw, is impressed with especially in the south! He's even able to convert people he's alienated because of his straightforward, down home style.In the meantime, Marcia is in love with him. Rhodes manipulates her, and she awaits him after he's proposed. But Lonesome has put on the charm to a cheerleader in a national contest and he marries her.Then a conservative figure wants Lonesome to help him in his Senate campaign. By then, Rhodes is a megastar and has become quite the megalomaniac!But the whole facade comes tumbling down for reasons I don't want to give away.The acting was outstanding. The only other familiar face among actors was that of Anthony Franciosa for whom I think it was also his first screen performance. Again, Griffith was stellar, as was Patricia Neal.The interview that's part of the DVD is worth nearly as much as the film. Andy Griffith is now a lot older and he states how Kazan told him to act toward, for example, the cheerleader he ends up marrying (for a while anyway). There is also discussion of what led Kazan to turn in his colleagues during the HUAC nightmare. I almost begin to sympathize with Kazan (though still appreciate his colleagues who had more guts and didn't turn in their friends). But a film such as this does exonerate Kazan to a degree; he did see the insidious influence of the ignorant power freaks that someone like Lonesome Rhodes can become.Yes, I said ""prescient"" in my title for reasons apparent earlier in this review. There are, unfortunately, media figures--ironically many of them who ARE the media they allegedly despise--who resemble Lonesome Rhodes. They have an inordinate degree of influence on those who adore them because they're celebrities.It can and does happen again and again and again. So a ""parable"" such as this fine film is something we need to remind ourselves of our own gullibility. Get it and show it to people as you discuss WHO they should pay attention to and why. It'll be a learning experience to get us out of the intellectual doldrums in which we find ourselves early in the 21st century!",5,A prescient masterpiece.,1290384000,"11 22, 2010",2010,3955,"['was', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'familiar', 'work', 'director', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'was', 'stood', 'up', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'presentation', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'seemed', ""'d"", 'rather', 'gutlessly', 'turned', 'members', 'Communist', 'Party', 'McCarthy', 'era', 'Hollywood', 'still', 'resented', 'it.After', 'years', 'have', 'gone', 'heard', 'newsman', 'work', 'like', 'refer', 'Lonesome', 'Rhodes', 'Beck', 'Glenn', 'Beck', 'popular', 'commentator', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'who', 'Lonesome', 'Rhodes', 'was', 'readCommon', 'Nonsense', 'Glenn', 'Beck', 'Triumph', 'Ignorance', 'fine', 'book', 'learned', 'film', 'was', 'fortunate', 'have', 'gotten', 'Amazon.com.I', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'impressed', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'parents', 'had', 'comedy', 'album', 'back', '1950s', 'who', 'can', 'forget', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'show', 'American', 'institution', 'Leave', 'Beaver', 'other', 'light', 'classics', 'Later', 'saw', 'movie', 'two', 'thought', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'Well', 'film', 'was', 'done', 'even', 'did', 'old', 'television', 'series', 'film', ""'d"", 'only', 'done', 'stage', 'acting', 'No', 'Time', 'Seargents', 'Broadway.I', ""'ll"", 'do', 'best', 'not', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'describing', 'Marcia', 'Jeffries', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'whom', 'may', 'remember', 'originalThe', 'Day', 'Earth', 'Stood', 'Still', 'local', 'radio', 'show', 'host', 'think', 'Arkansas', 'Man', 'Street', 'type', 'show', 'called', 'Face', 'Crowd', 'broadcast', 'local', 'jail', 'where', 'smartalek', 'drifter', 'Larry', 'Rhodes', 'getting', 'bender', 'night', 'Lonesome', 'Rhodes', 'story', 'Rhodes', 'charm', 'beat', 'band', 'drift', 'radio', 'show', 'full', 'time', 'charm.Rhodes', 'truly', 'move', 'ranks', 'offers', 'bigger', 'cities', 'script', 'was', 'ahead', 'Rhodes', 'had', 'appeal', 'black', 'audience', 'producer', 'portrayed', 'masterfully', 'Walter', 'Matthaw', 'impressed', 'especially', 'south', 'even', 'able', 'convert', 'people', 'alienated', 'straightforward', 'down', 'home', 'style.In', 'meantime', 'Marcia', 'love', 'Rhodes', 'proposed', 'Lonesome', 'put', 'charm', 'cheerleader', 'national', 'contest', 'conservative', 'figure', 'Lonesome', 'help', 'Senate', 'campaign', 'then', 'Rhodes', 'megastar', 'become', 'quite', 'megalomaniac', 'whole', 'facade', 'tumbling', 'down', 'reasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away.The', 'acting', 'was', 'outstanding', 'only', 'other', 'familiar', 'face', 'actors', 'was', 'Anthony', 'Franciosa', 'whom', 'think', 'was', 'also', 'first', 'screen', 'performance', 'Again', 'Griffith', 'was', 'stellar', 'was', 'Patricia', 'Neal.The', 'interview', 'part', 'DVD', 'worth', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'film', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'now', 'lot', 'older', 'how', 'Kazan', 'told', 'act', 'example', 'cheerleader', 'up', 'marrying', 'while', 'anyway', 'also', 'discussion', 'what', 'led', 'Kazan', 'turn', 'colleagues', 'HUAC', 'nightmare', 'almost', 'begin', 'sympathize', 'Kazan', 'still', 'appreciate', 'colleagues', 'who', 'had', 'more', 'guts', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'friends', 'film', 'such', 'exonerate', 'Kazan', 'degree', 'did', 'see', 'insidious', 'influence', 'ignorant', 'power', 'freaks', 'someone', 'Lonesome', 'Rhodes', 'can', 'become.Yes', 'said', 'prescient', 'title', 'reasons', 'apparent', 'earlier', 'review', 'are', 'unfortunately', 'media', 'figures', 'ironically', 'many', 'who', 'ARE', 'media', 'allegedly', 'despise', 'who', 'resemble', 'Lonesome', 'Rhodes', 'have', 'inordinate', 'degree', 'influence', 'who', 'adore', ""'re"", 'celebrities.It', 'can', 'happen', 'again', 'again', 'again', 'parable', 'such', 'fine', 'film', 'something', 'need', 'remind', 'ourselves', 'own', 'gullibility', 'Get', 'show', 'people', 'discuss', 'WHO', 'should', 'pay', 'attention', 'why', ""'ll"", 'be', 'learning', 'experience', 'get', 'intellectual', 'doldrums', 'find', 'early', '21st', 'century']",A Face in the Crowd VHS

239046,A4JHEO7H330AF,6300273210,Tom Brody,"[0, 1]","A FACE IN THE CROWD stars Andy Griffith and Patricia Neal. Mr. Griffith, of course, created an American institution out of himself by his role in ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW. Early in this film, I noticed Howard Smith, who I loved in the Twilight Zone episodes CAVENDER IS COMING (1962) and A STOP AT WILLOUGHBY (1960). Howard Smith is noted for his mouth, which he likes to twist in a curiously appealing manner. Because of Howard Smith's presence, I decided early on that I was going to like the entire movie, however, my mind gradually shifted in the opposite direction.BLUESMAN. The story starts out in a small town jail, which contains small-town derelicts such as Mr. Griffith, a confirmed lush. But Mr. Griffith is also a skilled bluesman. He plays bluesy numbers, while imitating Mississippi bluesmen, such as Willie Dixon and Muddy Waters. I told myself, if the Rolling Stones can, for a period of over 50 years, exploit Mississippi bluesmen by playing their songs and imitating their style, then I should try to tolerate Andy Griffith's character in A FACE IN THE CROWD doing the same. Eventually, Mr. Griffith's frequent imitations of an African-American's bluesy growl got on my nerves. One star off for Mr. Griffith's annoying imitations of a growling or raspy black man's voice. Griffith's imitation of a raspy laugh is annoying and too frequent in this movie.ADVERTISING AGENCY. Mr. Griffith is discovered by a woman from a radio station, Patricia Neal, who captures his blues songs and storytelling with a tape recorder. Mr. Griffith has no trouble getting hired as a regular on the radio show. The sponsor is a mattress company, and A FACE IN THE CROWD features some excellent and very humorous run-ins between Mr. Griffith's homespun and amusing candor and the sponsor. As Mr. Griffith's success as a performer explodes in popularity, the movie shifts to a new sponsor, the Vitajex company. A FACE IN THE CROWD features some excellent spoofs of the advertising industry, including some Vitajex commercials that are amusing and clever. I was getting to like the movie much more, because of the similar styles of the Vitajex commercials and the cartoons found in MAD MAGAZINE, which I read and cherished between the years 1957 and 1962. I believe that if the part of this movie that concerned advertising was used alone, it could easily be converted into an excellent 1-hour satire of the advertising profession.Then, I notice that the character played by Mr. Griffith had tendencies towards hanky-panky, and I decided that it was time to remove another star. The movie had an odd scene, where a former wife of Mr. Griffith complains about the legal aspects of a Mexican divorce. This part of the movie was jarring, and did not fit into any earlier part of the storyline, and did not fit into Mr. Griffith's character. The hanky-panky of Mr. Griffith's character increases to the point where the growing love-relationship between Griffith and Neal vanishes, and where Griffith marries a 17-year old girl (Lee Remick) on short notice. At that point, it was time to remove yet another star.MIXED UP. FACE IN THE CROWD deserves to have yet another star removed, because of the mixed-up hodge-podge of a plot. What is mixed up is this. The movie tries to be too many things at once. Is the movie about a homespun derelict who becomes a folk hero? Is the movie a spoof of the advertising industry, as it existed in the late 1950s? Is the movie a psychological morality story in the same vein as the very excellent NO DOWN PAYMENT (1957) and A RAGE TO LIVE (1965), both of which are black and white movies? The storyline also obviously influenced by Jerry Lee Lewis's problems when he married a young teenager. Also, the story was strongly influenced by bobby-sox fever that teenagers had for Frank Sinatra. A FACE IN THE CROWD tries to put too many strong themes into one movie. After the scene where Mr. Griffith had a bizarre over-the-top wedding ceremony with Lee Remick, I decided that enough was enough.

Although Rhodes infuriates the show's sponsor, his audience loves him. A wheeler-dealer office boy, Joey DePalma (Tony Franciosa), sets himself up as an agent and brokers a deal on behalf of Rhodes for a New York City television show. Rhodes growing popularity and influence goes to his head. He's rude to his staff and dumps fianc&eacute; Marcia for a 17-year-old baton twirler (Lee Remick). Rhodes' conservative sponsor soon has him playing kingmaker by stumping for right-wing Senator Fuller for President. Staff writer, Mel Miller (Walter Matthau), attempts to turn Marcia against Rhodes but she's already souring on her discovery. When Rhodes contemptuously berates viewers during closing credits of a show, Marcia manipulates the sound board, purposely broadcasting his insults. His audience and sponsors abandon Rhodes overnight. When no one shows up at his gathering for conservative politicians and corporate big shots, Rhodes calls Marcia threatening suicide. She goes to Rhodes' penthouse to reveal she was the one who betrayed him. The movie ends with Rhodes screaming for Marica as she rides away in a taxi.Kazan filmed the opening scenes of A Face in the Crowd in Piggott, Arkansas. Like in most of his films many non-actor locals were used. The house with the swimming pool is the Pfeiffer House, the home of businessman Paul Pfeiffer whose daughter was the second wife of Ernest Hemingway. Andy Griffith is a hoot in his film debut. Patricia Neal gives a great performance. The film did poor box office, which is understandable given the protagonist is a monster. There's no doubt the movie was ahead of its time as Bud Schulberg's script eerily foretold the role of television in politics. Sources reveal the character of Rhodes was inspired in part by Arthur Godfrey and Will Rogers.A Face in the Crowd has some wonderful scenes and some great performances but it's not a five-star movie. Schulberg and Kazan over-reached the mark with this undisguised left-wing, preachy, soapbox. One gets the feeling that with A Face in the Crowd, Schulberg and Kazan were saying, Sure, we may have named names before HUAC but see, we're still good liberals!This DVD includes no commentary but there is an interesting documentary, Facing the Past (2005), featuring interviews with Schulberg, Neal, and Griffith.",4,Kazan foretells role of television in politics,1319328000,"10 23, 2011",2011,2732,"['Face', 'Crowd', 'Warner', 'Bros.', '1957', 'was', 'director', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'thirteenth', 'film.A', 'radio', 'show', 'producer', 'Marcia', 'Jeffries', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'talented', 'drifter', 'Larry', 'Rhodes', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'small', 'town', 'Arkansas', 'jail', 'presenting', 'moniker', 'Lonesome', 'Rhodes', 'given', 'slot', 'local', 'radio', 'folksy', 'irreverent', 'humor', 'so', 'popular', 'soon', 'invited', 'host', 'Memphis', 'television', 'program', 'Rhodes', 'show', 'sponsor', 'audience', 'wheeler-dealer', 'office', 'boy', 'Joey', 'DePalma', 'Tony', 'Franciosa', 'up', 'agent', 'brokers', 'deal', 'behalf', 'Rhodes', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'television', 'show', 'Rhodes', 'growing', 'popularity', 'influence', 'head', 'rude', 'staff', 'dumps', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Marcia', '17-year-old', 'baton', 'twirler', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'Rhodes', 'conservative', 'sponsor', 'soon', 'playing', 'kingmaker', 'stumping', 'right-wing', 'Senator', 'Fuller', 'President', 'Staff', 'writer', 'Mel', 'Miller', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'turn', 'Marcia', 'Rhodes', 'already', 'souring', 'discovery', 'When', 'Rhodes', 'contemptuously', 'viewers', 'closing', 'credits', 'show', 'Marcia', 'sound', 'board', 'purposely', 'broadcasting', 'insults', 'audience', 'sponsors', 'abandon', 'Rhodes', 'overnight', 'When', 'one', 'up', 'gathering', 'conservative', 'politicians', 'corporate', 'big', 'shots', 'Rhodes', 'Marcia', 'threatening', 'suicide', 'Rhodes', 'penthouse', 'reveal', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'betrayed', 'movie', 'Rhodes', 'screaming', 'Marica', 'away', 'taxi.Kazan', 'filmed', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Face', 'Crowd', 'Piggott', 'Arkansas', 'most', 'films', 'many', 'non-actor', 'locals', 'were', 'used', 'house', 'swimming', 'pool', 'Pfeiffer', 'House', 'home', 'businessman', 'Paul', 'Pfeiffer', 'daughter', 'was', 'second', 'wife', 'Ernest', 'Hemingway', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'hoot', 'film', 'debut', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'great', 'performance', 'film', 'did', 'poor', 'box', 'office', 'understandable', 'given', 'protagonist', 'monster', 'doubt', 'movie', 'was', 'ahead', 'time', 'Bud', 'Schulberg', 'script', 'eerily', 'foretold', 'role', 'television', 'politics', 'Sources', 'reveal', 'character', 'Rhodes', 'was', 'inspired', 'part', 'Arthur', 'Godfrey', 'Will', 'Rogers.A', 'Face', 'Crowd', 'wonderful', 'scenes', 'great', 'performances', 'not', 'five-star', 'movie', 'Schulberg', 'Kazan', 'over-reached', 'mark', 'undisguised', 'left-wing', 'preachy', 'soapbox', 'One', 'feeling', 'Face', 'Crowd', 'Schulberg', 'Kazan', 'were', 'saying', 'Sure', 'may', 'have', 'named', 'names', 'HUAC', 'see', ""'re"", 'still', 'good', 'liberals', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'Facing', 'Past', '2005', 'featuring', 'interviews', 'Schulberg', 'Neal', 'Griffith']",A Face in the Crowd VHS

Once his handlers and agents get him on television the road to New York and national fame is made to seem a snap in this drama.  And once Lonesome Rhodes hits the big time jackpot, no one in his path is safe, including his manager/lover, Marcia Jeffries well played by Patricia Neal.A FACE IN THE CROWD chronicles the rise and fall of a demagogue, nothing reallynew only this one uses the then latest phase of electronic media, television.At this time television was the new face in the family living room and wasusually an overly polite guest, not counting commercials. So to see what damaging effect our friendly electronic visitor could have not just on our buying habits but on our voting as well as our thinking patterns might have been shocking to those who pulled themselves away from the set to see this movie at the theater.Of course eventually A FACE IN THE CROWD was shown on television amid commercials and station breaks, usually late at night, and it's doubtful this films impact was as shocking as it was originally intended.  In fact, as the movie unreels, it becomes a littletoo shrill, implying what once was smartly satirical is now  shouting down at us from the highest penthouse balcony in New York City insisting that this story is  our future.Of course we all know that it can't happen, the entertainers and commentators who are featured on our modern electronic media are sober and responsible broadcasters who would never use such baloney to make thier points and just plain outright lie to us.After all, our election campaigns fill those needs efficiently and quite well.So I rate A FACE IN THE CROWD a hearty four stars and recommend it despite a rather  shrieking  conclusion.This DVD edition of A FACE IN THE CROWD includes a documentary about the film, thetheatrical trailer and subtitles in English, French and Spanish.",4,One Out Of Milllions,1261008000,"12 17, 2009",2009,2397,"['revue', 'WB', 'DVD', 'film', 'A', 'FACE', 'IN', 'THE', 'CROWD', '1957', 'widescreen', 'b', 'w', 'release', 'was', 'written', 'Budd', 'Shulberg', 'directed', 'Elia', 'Kazan.A', 'FACE', 'IN', 'THE', 'CROWD', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'Walther', 'Matthau', 'andAnthony', 'Franciosa.Andy', 'Griffith', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'Lonesome', 'Rhodes', 'drifter', 'who', 'how', 'use', 'guitar', 'eventually', 'exploit', 'outgoing', 'personality', 'persuade', 'numbers', 'people', 'buy', 'anything', 'commercial', 'products', 'political', 'philosophy', 'eventually', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'handlers', 'agents', 'get', 'television', 'road', 'New', 'York', 'national', 'fame', 'made', 'seem', 'snap', 'drama', 'once', 'Lonesome', 'Rhodes', 'big', 'time', 'jackpot', 'one', 'path', 'safe', 'including', 'manager/lover', 'Marcia', 'Jeffries', 'well', 'played', 'Patricia', 'Neal.A', 'FACE', 'IN', 'THE', 'CROWD', 'rise', 'fall', 'demagogue', 'nothing', 'reallynew', 'only', 'one', 'then', 'latest', 'phase', 'electronic', 'media', 'television.At', 'time', 'television', 'was', 'new', 'face', 'family', 'living', 'room', 'wasusually', 'overly', 'polite', 'guest', 'not', 'counting', 'commercials', 'So', 'see', 'what', 'damaging', 'effect', 'friendly', 'electronic', 'visitor', 'could', 'have', 'not', 'just', 'buying', 'habits', 'voting', 'as', 'well', 'thinking', 'patterns', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'shocking', 'who', 'pulled', 'away', 'set', 'see', 'movie', 'theater.Of', 'course', 'eventually', 'A', 'FACE', 'IN', 'THE', 'CROWD', 'was', 'shown', 'television', 'commercials', 'station', 'breaks', 'usually', 'late', 'night', 'doubtful', 'films', 'impact', 'was', 'as', 'shocking', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', 'fact', 'movie', 'unreels', 'littletoo', 'shrill', 'implying', 'what', 'once', 'was', 'smartly', 'satirical', 'now', 'shouting', 'down', 'highest', 'penthouse', 'balcony', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'insisting', 'story', 'future.Of', 'course', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'happen', 'entertainers', 'commentators', 'who', 'are', 'featured', 'modern', 'electronic', 'media', 'are', 'sober', 'responsible', 'broadcasters', 'who', 'would', 'never', 'use', 'such', 'baloney', 'make', 'thier', 'points', 'just', 'plain', 'outright', 'lie', 'us.After', 'election', 'campaigns', 'fill', 'needs', 'efficiently', 'quite', 'well.So', 'rate', 'FACE', 'IN', 'THE', 'CROWD', 'hearty', 'four', 'stars', 'recommend', 'rather', 'shrieking', 'conclusion.This', 'DVD', 'edition', 'A', 'FACE', 'IN', 'THE', 'CROWD', 'documentary', 'film', 'thetheatrical', 'trailer', 'subtitles', 'English', 'French', 'Spanish']",A Face in the Crowd VHS

239051,A3PD6WWOPKPLJ9,6300273210,"Wayne Engle ""Wayne Engle""","[2, 2]","Andy Griffith's first starring role may have been the best performance he ever gave -- and he never played a character like Larry ""Lonesome"" Rhodes again.This is an absolutely riveting film, the story of a drunken, foot-loose ne'er-do-well who catches lightning in a bottle when a local radio reporter records an interview with him, waking him up while he's ""sleepin' one off"" in the local Arkansas jail. Larry Rhodes -- christened ""Lonesome Rhodes"" on the spot by the reporter, played expertly by Patricia Neal -- shows that his let-it-all-hang-out, anarchistic monologue style translates well to radio, then television, bringing him literally millions of goo-goo-eyed followers -- mostly women of the working class. Lonesome Rhodes becomes a national star, then an advisor of high-ranking political candidates.But then Patricia Neal, who has fallen in love with this brash, iconoclastic knight of the road, is done dirty by him when he marries someone else -- someone much, much younger. In the end, it is a species of retaliation by Neal that brings Lonesome Rhodes back to earth with a resounding crash.The other actors in this drama are merely backdrops for Andy Griffith and, to a much lesser extent, Patricia Neal. Griffith plays a character who is at once charismatic with a capital ""C,"" with a wonderfully rubber face which expresses every emotion; and also is, in quieter moments, a dark, brooding man with an uncaring, evil side. He inhabits the character of Lonesome Rhodes in such a way that one can hardly tear one's gaze away from him when he is in one of his stream-of-consciousness, ""I'm just one of y'all"" rants. There are scenes where Neal watches him, awestruck and wide-eyed. And the women and girls especially in his audiences scream and squirm at the sight and sound of him, a la the early followers of Elvis Presley. Remember, Elvis' first year of big-time success was 1956, the year before this film was released. Did Budd Schulberg borrow elements of the Presley story? Possibly, although I've never heard a professional film critic suggest that.For all the unpleasant aspects of Lonesome Rhodes as a man, there are still reasons one must grudgingly admire him. He will not allow himself to be ""talked down to,"" or kowtow or tug his forelock to his ""betters."" For instance, when Neal and her wealthy uncle, owner of the radio station, pick him up while he is trying to thumb a ride out of town, guitar case in hand, the uncle says in patrician tones, ""Get in the back."" Rhodes throws his guitar in through the open back window, jerks the front passenger door open, and pushes Neal over so he can sit in the front -- ""with the White folks,"" one might have said ironically in those pre-racial self-consciousness days.Earlier, when the sheriff of the town tells Larry Rhodes that he can get out of jail early if he'll agree to the recorded interview with Neal, Rhodes looks him straight in the face and says, ""Well, sheriff, you've sorta got the name of not keeping your promises."" Lonesome Rhodes may be a demagogue in embryo, but he won't back off or flinch in the face of authority.If you've never seen ""A Face in the Crowd,"" if your only memory of Andy Griffith is as Andy of Mayberry, or in ""No Time for Sergeants,"" or as ""Matlock"" on TV, then you've missed the amazing depths of this actor. By all means, this drama is well worth viewing.",5,Not your Andy of Mayberry!,1342656000,"07 19, 2012",2012,3367,"['Andy', 'Griffith', 'first', 'starring', 'role', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'performance', 'ever', 'gave', 'never', 'played', 'character', 'Larry', 'Lonesome', 'Rhodes', 'again.This', 'absolutely', 'riveting', 'film', 'story', 'drunken', 'foot-loose', ""ne'er-do-well"", 'who', 'lightning', 'bottle', 'when', 'local', 'radio', 'reporter', 'records', 'interview', 'waking', 'up', 'sleepin', 'one', 'off', 'local', 'Arkansas', 'jail', 'Larry', 'Rhodes', 'christened', 'Lonesome', 'Rhodes', 'spot', 'reporter', 'played', 'expertly', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'let-it-all-hang-out', 'anarchistic', 'monologue', 'style', 'well', 'radio', 'then', 'television', 'bringing', 'literally', 'millions', 'goo-goo-eyed', 'followers', 'mostly', 'women', 'working', 'class', 'Lonesome', 'Rhodes', 'national', 'star', 'then', 'advisor', 'high-ranking', 'political', 'candidates.But', 'then', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'who', 'fallen', 'love', 'brash', 'iconoclastic', 'knight', 'road', 'done', 'dirty', 'when', 'someone', 'else', 'someone', 'much', 'much', 'younger', 'end', 'species', 'retaliation', 'Neal', 'Lonesome', 'Rhodes', 'back', 'earth', 'resounding', 'crash.The', 'other', 'actors', 'drama', 'are', 'merely', 'backdrops', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'much', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'Griffith', 'character', 'who', 'once', 'charismatic', 'capital', 'C', 'wonderfully', 'rubber', 'face', 'emotion', 'also', 'quieter', 'moments', 'dark', 'brooding', 'man', 'uncaring', 'evil', 'side', 'character', 'Lonesome', 'Rhodes', 'such', 'way', 'one', 'can', 'hardly', 'tear', 'one', 'gaze', 'away', 'when', 'one', 'stream-of-consciousness', ""'m"", 'just', 'one', ""y'all"", 'rants', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'Neal', 'awestruck', 'wide-eyed', 'women', 'girls', 'especially', 'audiences', 'scream', 'squirm', 'sight', 'sound', 'la', 'early', 'followers', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'Remember', 'Elvis', 'first', 'year', 'big-time', 'success', 'was', '1956', 'year', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'Did', 'Budd', 'Schulberg', 'borrow', 'elements', 'Presley', 'story', 'Possibly', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'professional', 'film', 'critic', 'suggest', 'unpleasant', 'aspects', 'Lonesome', 'Rhodes', 'man', 'are', 'still', 'reasons', 'one', 'must', 'grudgingly', 'admire', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'be', 'talked', 'down', 'kowtow', 'tug', 'forelock', 'betters', 'instance', 'when', 'Neal', 'wealthy', 'uncle', 'owner', 'radio', 'station', 'pick', 'up', 'trying', 'thumb', 'ride', 'town', 'guitar', 'case', 'hand', 'uncle', 'patrician', 'tones', 'Get', 'back', 'guitar', 'open', 'back', 'window', 'front', 'passenger', 'door', 'open', 'pushes', 'Neal', 'so', 'can', 'sit', 'front', 'White', 'folks', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'said', 'ironically', 'pre-racial', 'self-consciousness', 'days.Earlier', 'when', 'sheriff', 'town', 'tells', 'Larry', 'Rhodes', 'can', 'get', 'jail', 'early', ""'ll"", 'agree', 'recorded', 'interview', 'Neal', 'Rhodes', 'straight', 'face', 'Well', 'sheriff', ""'ve"", 'sorta', 'got', 'name', 'not', 'keeping', 'promises', 'Lonesome', 'Rhodes', 'may', 'be', 'demagogue', 'embryo', 'wo', ""n't"", 'back', 'off', 'flinch', 'face', 'authority.If', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Face', 'Crowd', 'only', 'memory', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Andy', 'Mayberry', 'No', 'Time', 'Sergeants', 'Matlock', 'TV', 'then', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'amazing', 'depths', 'actor', 'means', 'drama', 'well', 'worth', 'viewing']",A Face in the Crowd VHS

I first saw this movie in a theater in 1957, when I was 12 years old. Regardless of my tender age, I was mesmerized and dumbstruck by its sheer power, its acting, directing - and, most importantly, its prescience about the power of the then-new medium, television, to dramatically (often adversely) affect public opinion. As soon as this movie became available in VHS format, I purchased it from Amazon and continue to watch it whenever I have the intestinal fortitude (because it's a very dark movie) to do so.Andy Griffith's acting talents are superb. This is NOT the Andy Griffith of the sitcom in which he starred as the sheriff of Mayberry. Kazan's direction brought out the best in all the stars, including Lee Remick, in her first acting role, and Walter Matthau, playing the level-headed friend of Patricia Neal's character. It's a painful movie, as it shows the rise of a drunken yokel (""Lonesome Rhodes"") to TV and radio stardom -- to the point that he influences political decisions and socializes with the elite -- and his tragic fall when his manager and spurned lover, played by Patricia Neal, leaves the microphone open as the credits for his TV show are rolling and he, thinking that the microphone is off, expresses his real opinions about his followers, who finally see and hear the ""man behind the mask"" and the utter contempt with which he views them.

239053,A1QIL7847ET6HX,6300273210,xxgrendelxx,"[3, 9]","Please understand a few things: I love Elia Kazan's films though they do not cover subject matter I am generally interested in - the man is a master filmmaker. That he has held my interest in a dozen or so films I otherwise would have skipped over is no small feat.""A Face in the Crowd"" itself is a masterpiece, a hideously ugly jewel whose facets reflect the corruption in our own hearts while simultaneously holding us spellbound by it's operatic dazzle. It's story is a claymore thrust to the heart of the television entertainment industry at a time when it was just feeling it's oats and flexing it's muscle. As the motion picture industry feared its own demise due to television's exponentially growing popularity, this is no great surprise and it's a wonder the studios hadn't had something to say like this earlier in the 1950s - still, it is shocking how raw and unrestrained Bud Schulberg and Kazan's script is, and Andy Griffith's ""Lonesome Rhodes"" stands out as one of the greatest all-time villains of cinema, loathesome yet magnetic. He seems to know how good he was at ""being bad"" too, since he refused to ever play a role so crooked ever again.However, this outstanding film is marred by one of the most dishonest and misleading morals ever committed to a celluloid soundtrack, wherein Patricia Neal's heartbroken and horrified character is consoled by Walter Matthau: ""Next time, we'll know better..."".Throughout the Victorian age there held fast an authoritarian stance and notion that national institutions were pure and sublime. If anything untoward occured involving the members of these organisations then it must be those individual's fault - ""a few bad apples do not spoil the bunch"". The system was pure and rigtheous, the individual may be corrupt. This stance may be traced back over two thousand years to Confucianism and Confucius himself, who, when asked how men of good character might be identified and promoted within government, replied with irritation ""Promote those you KNOW to be of good character!"". In his own era (as in our own), the better the actor, the further up the ""food-chain"" one climbed. Good character was in his day, and remains, an often hidden trait that only surfaces in crisis. And bad character (or no-character) abounds.This attitude and stance of ""institutional integrity"" persisted long into the twentieth century and is responsible in great part for the difficulties encountered by suffragettes and progressives in changing long-standing inequities in law, government, civil and commercial institutions - a fight that still continues daily.When Walter Matthau's character insists that ""Next time, we'll know better"" he is protecting the appearance of integrity of the ""machine"", the television entertainment business, which by 1957 was as corrupt as one might expect in an unregulated industry where the only measure of success is in the bottom line (exactly as today). He places the blame, all of the blame, on Griffith's ""Lonesome Rhodes"" for being greedy, disdainful and self absorbed. ""Rhodes"" sociopathic tendencies are of his own making in this rationale, and not the product of months of instruction. That Kazan and Schulberg wrote it this way indicates a complete indoctrination with this manner of thinking, a manner of thinking that was to come under the test and found wanting within a very few years of this film's release, when millions of young Americans began questioning ""the way things are"".Kazan was no stranger to conservative views: his ""On the Waterfront"", while also a masterpiece and a personal favorite despite it's underlying theme, sings the praises of aiding authorities in witch-hunts (Kazan had testified as a friendly witness to the House Un-American Activities Committee in the 1950s) while simultaneously, if obliquely, insulting the legitmate Left Wing viewpoint by portraying them as no better than gangsters and unquestionably crooked. Here, too, is evidence that he was unduly impressed with the percieved integrity of institutions and unquestioningly aided men in positions of authority who gave false testimony before nation and God simply to further their careers in politics.""A Face in the Crowd"" is not merely dishonest in it's final dialogue: the entire idea that it takes a sweaty incarcerated guitar playing drifter to school entertainment and advertising executives on how to appeal to the public is not only absurd but insulting to those very industries who have spent trillions of dollars over decades to get the American public to buy what they are selling. That Matthau and Neal play doe-eyed corporate ""Pollyanna""s is the final insult aimed directly at the audience's percieved gullibility since they are the only characters within the photoplay one is expected to identify with. They are utterly fictitious.In light of what we know today of the television, advertising and public relations industries, it is completely dishonest to expect the public to cheer for these phoney secondary characters - and cruel and manipulative that we are MADE to, as cruel and manipulative as ""Lonesome Rhodes"" himself.",2,"Great film, flawed premise and moral...",1310688000,"07 15,
