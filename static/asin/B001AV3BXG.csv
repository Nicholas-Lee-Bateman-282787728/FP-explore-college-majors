There, I said it, sorry to be so blunt, but I can't be nice about this.The connection to the story of the ""Scorpion King"" is about as tenuous as the directors grip on this movie.I don't mind sword and sorcery hokum, even the low budget variety, but I ended up feeling sorry for the actors in this one.We have all the standard makings of a franchise follow up.Hero - checkBabe - checkGeek - checkBad guy - checkAdd the stock additional characters to add supposed depth, but there chiefly to die in some grisly fashion, some tricky situations, monsters, and a good dose of ""dark magic"" and you've about got it all.Oh, I almost forgot, the hero's father was killed by the Bad Guy, so was his brother, and probably his hamster, so revenge is foremost in his mind, most of the time.This is dire, the acting is awful, the special effects are very cheap and choppy, even the blue screen stuff looks bad.On a separate note, the Sword of Damocles (needed to kill the bad guy) the last time I checked wasn't left spinning in the Underworld, but hung from a single horse hair. Oh, and the minotaur lived in a Labyrinth, not a dungeon. Oh, and the underworld was ruled by Hades, not some seductive dark witch................I could go on, and onLike a mug I purchased the Blu Ray hoping for great things, and got stung (at least I picked it up cheap).

1168503,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B001AV3BXG,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[1, 2]","THE SCORPION KING 2RISE OF A WARRIORWhen watching this film I couldn't help but think three things, one is that how awesome is it that Randy Couture has a starring role in this, two this would have made a better episode of Hercules The Legendary Journeys, and three this is in no way as good as the first. Ok maybe that last one is a bit false since this one has great production value going for it like the first but that is about it. When I first found out about this film all I could think was that I needed to buy it because of Randy and that I owned the first one. After watching all I could think was that was all right I guess, if it would have been a stand alone it may have faired better. In fact what is up with a prequel to a prequel, oh well I guess it was worth exploring. Still this isn't as bad as I am making it sound if you go into it knowing what type of film you are in for.Our story this time sees a young Mathayus [Michael Copon] wanting to join the ranks of the Black Scorpions which is the king's army. But all does not go according to plan as his friend Layla [Karen David] joins in on the try outs which is only for boys, of course the head of the guard Sargon [Randy Couture] is not about to let that happen. As she is about to be punished Mathayus steps in and therefore must be punished as well. This does not set well with Ashur [Peter Butler] Mathayus's father so he steps in to save his boy and get into it with Sargon, the king has to break it up before it gets ugly. It is this moment that sends Sargon into a rage that ends with Ashur dead and a young Mathayus wanting revenge.So off he goes to join and train as a Black Scorpion so that one day he will have the skills necessary to defeat the murderer of his father. Once back things don't go as planned and he as well as Layla are off on a quest to find some magical sword in the underworld that can defeat Sargon's black magic. It is here were they run into a young poet/writer named Aristophanes or Ari as the obvious short. It is also here that the film contradicts the first one but more on that later. Here our group of young heroes travel across sea, deserts, a labyrinth, and even the dreaded underworld [which actually looks really cool]. They also do battle with minotaur, other people, and the queen of the underworld, sounds like quite the adventure. All of that is fine and well and is entertaining but it comes off as a TV show like Hercules more so than a feature film.This is far from a perfect film as there are plot holes every were and this film actually contradicts the first. I won't go into a list or any thing but the most obvious is the Egypt thing. I am pretty sure that at the beginning of the first one the voice over says something like ""in a time before the pyramids"" right? Well when they are getting their tickets for the boat they say they are taking a trip to Egypt to see the pyramids, now if the first was before the pyramids and this is before the first, well. I won't go into any more of those but that is a big enough one right there at least for me, I hate when they do that. I guess the fault would be with writer Randall McCormick, he should have at least watched the first one and noticed that. His writing isn't all bad though because unlike most people I really don't mind the mixing in of all the other myths like the Minotaur and such. Sure it doesn't make full sense with this film, but hey at least it is entertaining.Director Russell Mulcahy did ok with this film but his direction seemed uneven at times, but watching the behind the scenes and listening to the commentary it is obvious that he wanted to make a good film. I guess my biggest complaint is that I really did not see the character of Mathayus coming up like this, I don't know but it seems like he would have came up a little harder and in a more realistic struggle. And while Michael Copon did a good job with what he was given to play Mathayus I just didn't see that same character in him. But that may been due to the writing of the character, but at the same time the performance should have been there. Karen David was good as Layla and as the romantic interest of Mathayus and Tom Wu was excellent as Fong. Still the stand out characters were Ari played by Simon Quarterman and like I said in the last one I am a sucker for comic relief. And of course Sargon played by Randy Couture who does a good job for what is first major role, you can see flaws at times but for the most part he is good as the evil lead.This is a decent movie over all and is worth a rental to see if you are into it first, but if you didn't like the first you will most likely hate this one. One thing I must say though is that the production value was good on this, the underworld looked awesomely creepy with those faces and stuff sticking out moaning in pain and loneliness.",3,DECENT - GOOD THING RANDY COUTURE IS IN THIS,1242691200,"05 19, 2009",2009,4855,"['SCORPION', 'KING', '2RISE', 'A', 'WARRIORWhen', 'watching', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'three', 'things', 'one', 'how', 'awesome', 'Randy', 'Couture', 'starring', 'role', 'two', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'episode', 'Hercules', 'Legendary', 'Journeys', 'three', 'way', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'maybe', 'last', 'one', 'bit', 'false', 'one', 'great', 'production', 'value', 'going', 'first', 'When', 'first', 'found', 'out', 'film', 'could', 'think', 'was', 'needed', 'buy', 'Randy', 'owned', 'first', 'one', 'watching', 'could', 'think', 'was', 'was', 'right', 'guess', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'stand', 'may', 'have', 'faired', 'better', 'fact', 'what', 'up', 'prequel', 'prequel', 'oh', 'well', 'guess', 'was', 'worth', 'exploring', 'Still', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'am', 'making', 'sound', 'go', 'knowing', 'what', 'type', 'film', 'are', 'for.Our', 'story', 'time', 'young', 'Mathayus', '[', 'Michael', 'Copon', ']', 'wanting', 'join', 'ranks', 'Black', 'Scorpions', 'king', 'army', 'not', 'go', 'according', 'plan', 'friend', 'Layla', '[', 'Karen', 'David', ']', 'try', 'outs', 'only', 'boys', 'course', 'head', 'guard', 'Sargon', '[', 'Randy', 'Couture', ']', 'not', 'let', 'happen', 'be', 'punished', 'Mathayus', 'steps', 'therefore', 'must', 'be', 'punished', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'set', 'well', 'Ashur', '[', 'Peter', 'Butler', ']', 'Mathayus', 'father', 'so', 'save', 'boy', 'get', 'Sargon', 'king', 'break', 'up', 'ugly', 'moment', 'Sargon', 'rage', 'Ashur', 'dead', 'young', 'Mathayus', 'wanting', 'revenge.So', 'join', 'train', 'Black', 'Scorpion', 'one', 'day', 'will', 'have', 'skills', 'necessary', 'defeat', 'murderer', 'father', 'Once', 'back', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'planned', 'as', 'well', 'Layla', 'are', 'off', 'quest', 'find', 'magical', 'sword', 'underworld', 'can', 'defeat', 'Sargon', 'black', 'magic', 'here', 'were', 'run', 'young', 'poet/writer', 'named', 'Aristophanes', 'Ari', 'obvious', 'short', 'also', 'here', 'film', 'first', 'one', 'more', 'later', 'Here', 'group', 'young', 'heroes', 'travel', 'sea', 'deserts', 'labyrinth', 'even', 'dreaded', 'underworld', '[', 'actually', 'really', 'cool', ']', 'also', 'do', 'battle', 'minotaur', 'other', 'people', 'queen', 'underworld', 'quite', 'adventure', 'fine', 'well', 'entertaining', 'off', 'TV', 'show', 'Hercules', 'more', 'so', 'feature', 'film.This', 'far', 'perfect', 'film', 'are', 'plot', 'holes', 'were', 'film', 'actually', 'first', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'list', 'thing', 'most', 'obvious', 'Egypt', 'thing', 'am', 'pretty', 'sure', 'beginning', 'first', 'one', 'voice', 'something', 'time', 'pyramids', 'right', 'Well', 'when', 'are', 'getting', 'tickets', 'boat', 'say', 'are', 'taking', 'trip', 'Egypt', 'see', 'pyramids', 'now', 'first', 'was', 'pyramids', 'first', 'well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'more', 'big', 'enough', 'one', 'right', 'there', 'least', 'hate', 'when', 'do', 'guess', 'fault', 'would', 'be', 'writer', 'Randall', 'McCormick', 'should', 'have', 'least', 'watched', 'first', 'one', 'noticed', 'writing', ""n't"", 'bad', 'most', 'people', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'mixing', 'other', 'myths', 'Minotaur', 'such', 'Sure', ""n't"", 'make', 'full', 'sense', 'film', 'hey', 'least', 'entertaining.Director', 'Russell', 'Mulcahy', 'did', 'ok', 'film', 'direction', 'seemed', 'uneven', 'times', 'watching', 'scenes', 'listening', 'commentary', 'obvious', 'wanted', 'make', 'good', 'film', 'guess', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'character', 'Mathayus', 'coming', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', 'have', 'came', 'up', 'little', 'harder', 'more', 'realistic', 'struggle', 'Michael', 'Copon', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'what', 'was', 'given', 'play', 'Mathayus', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'same', 'character', 'may', 'been', 'due', 'writing', 'character', 'same', 'time', 'performance', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'there', 'Karen', 'David', 'was', 'good', 'Layla', 'romantic', 'interest', 'Mathayus', 'Tom', 'Wu', 'was', 'excellent', 'Fong', 'Still', 'stand', 'characters', 'were', 'Ari', 'played', 'Simon', 'Quarterman', 'said', 'last', 'one', 'am', 'sucker', 'comic', 'relief', 'course', 'Sargon', 'played', 'Randy', 'Couture', 'who', 'good', 'job', 'what', 'first', 'major', 'role', 'can', 'see', 'flaws', 'times', 'most', 'part', 'good', 'evil', 'lead.This', 'decent', 'movie', 'rental', 'see', 'are', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'first', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'hate', 'one', 'One', 'thing', 'must', 'say', 'production', 'value', 'was', 'good', 'underworld', 'looked', 'awesomely', 'creepy', 'stuff', 'sticking', 'out', 'moaning', 'pain', 'loneliness']",The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior
1168504,A3BTL4FV6ODKAT,B001AV3BXG,"fredtownward ""The Analytical Mind; Have Brain...","[2, 2]","Like the running gag so often repeated throughout this movie: ""Never trust a Greek,"" my review title offers a pretty good rule of thumb, but is it always true?  Is it true in the case of this movie?  To my very considerable surprise the answer was no.Because I had simply assumed it was awful, I'd avoided it for years, despite knowing from my own experience that similar assumptions about the prequel it is a prequel to had turned out to be false.  So does that mean The Scorpion King 2 is anotherThe Scorpion King?  Not quite.The lower budget definitely shows as does the cast of even more unknowns, even less barely knowns, and even less well known character actors.  Randy Couture's performance is so wooden you'll expect him to sprout leaves.  Finally, the writing is even more constrained by subsequent events as not only the young couple but the entire Akkadian civilization is known beforehand to be ultimately doomed.  (Like The Scorpion King this movie works best if you forget about everyone's eventual dark fate.)Nevertheless, cast and crew put in a mighty effort, and it shows.  Simon Quarterman steals every scene he's in as the untrustworthy Greek in question, and Tom Wu does an amazing job in what is essentially a nonspeaking part as a hopelessly lost Chinese acrobat.  Natalie Becker gives a nicely disturbing performance as a borderline psychotic goddess, through deliberate mannerisms Michael Copon manages a better Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson imitation than I would have thought possible, and Karen David gives us a spunky, more believable than it ought to be, performance as the girl next door who insists on being one of the boys.  In particular there was good effort all around to make the necessarily low budget fight scenes look good.Could it have been better?  Absolutely, but IMHO no one involved has anything to be ashamed of about a good solid (if not as professionally polished as I would have preferred) effort.",4,Never Trust a Prequel of a Prequel,1349395200,"10 5, 2012",2012,1942,"['running', 'gag', 'so', 'often', 'repeated', 'movie', 'Never', 'trust', 'Greek', 'review', 'title', 'pretty', 'good', 'rule', 'thumb', 'always', 'true', 'true', 'case', 'movie', 'very', 'considerable', 'surprise', 'answer', 'was', 'no.Because', 'had', 'simply', 'assumed', 'was', 'awful', ""'d"", 'avoided', 'years', 'knowing', 'own', 'experience', 'similar', 'assumptions', 'prequel', 'prequel', 'had', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'false', 'So', 'mean', 'Scorpion', 'King', '2', 'anotherThe', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'Not', 'quite.The', 'lower', 'budget', 'definitely', 'cast', 'even', 'more', 'unknowns', 'even', 'less', 'barely', 'knowns', 'even', 'less', 'well', 'known', 'character', 'actors', 'Randy', 'Couture', 'performance', 'so', 'wooden', ""'ll"", 'expect', 'sprout', 'leaves', 'Finally', 'writing', 'even', 'more', 'constrained', 'subsequent', 'events', 'not', 'only', 'young', 'couple', 'entire', 'Akkadian', 'civilization', 'known', 'beforehand', 'be', 'ultimately', 'doomed', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'movie', 'best', 'forget', 'everyone', 'eventual', 'dark', 'fate', 'Nevertheless', 'cast', 'crew', 'put', 'mighty', 'effort', 'Simon', 'Quarterman', 'scene', 'untrustworthy', 'Greek', 'question', 'Tom', 'Wu', 'amazing', 'job', 'what', 'essentially', 'nonspeaking', 'part', 'hopelessly', 'lost', 'Chinese', 'acrobat', 'Natalie', 'Becker', 'nicely', 'disturbing', 'performance', 'borderline', 'psychotic', 'goddess', 'deliberate', 'mannerisms', 'Michael', 'Copon', 'better', 'Dwayne', 'Rock', 'Johnson', 'imitation', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'possible', 'Karen', 'David', 'spunky', 'more', 'believable', 'ought', 'be', 'performance', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'who', 'being', 'one', 'boys', 'particular', 'was', 'good', 'effort', 'make', 'necessarily', 'low', 'budget', 'fight', 'scenes', 'look', 'good.Could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Absolutely', 'IMHO', 'one', 'involved', 'anything', 'be', 'ashamed', 'good', 'solid', 'not', 'professionally', 'polished', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'effort']",The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior

1168511,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B001AV3BXG,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[28, 33]","After only amassing a moderate box office success with 2003's ""The Scorpion King"" starring former wrestling superstar Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Universal Pictures apparently put on hold any potential sequels to the prequel (that sounded funny... oh well) of their popular ""The Mummy"" series. In 2008, Universal dusted off the character of the Scorpion King for another shot at movie audiences; however, this effort would not star The Rock, as it was to be a prequel (a decision that I believe was prompted by The Rock most likely rejecting the notion of starring in another `Scorpion King' movie), and it would also skip any kind of theatrical release, going directly to DVD. So, let me think about this for a second, the star of the original movie most likely rejected the idea of reprising his role for a sequel, potentially causing the shift from sequel to prequel, then the movie skips theaters altogether and goes directly to DVD, finally getting released around the same time as another `Mummy' movie was hitting theaters. Does anyone else besides me believe that this spelled potential disaster for this second entry in the inferior spin-off series to ""The Mummy""? Let's have a show of hands... Yeah, that's what I thought, pretty much everyone sees this movie as nothing more than a hack job primarily made for cashing in on the recently released ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"".""The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior"" centers on a young Mathayus (Michael Copon) as he begins learning the ways of an assassin in order to better serve his king. However, when a warrior named Sargon (Randy Couture) murders Mathayus' father, Mathayus forgoes his oath of honor to begin a quest for vengeance against the evil Sargon and all those that side with him.Wow, I don't know if I can think of a time when the description on the back of a DVD could have been further from the truth. The description touted this action/adventure prequel as ""...a heroic adventure filled with heart-stopping action and thrilling visual effects!"" Well, I'm not sure what movie the marketing people that came up with that load of bull were watching, but it sure wasn't ""The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior"", I can tell you that right now. For a movie with supposedly ""heart-stopping action"", I was fairly bored a good majority of the time, and as for the ""thrilling visual effects"" they were more like B-movie effects or worse. In fact, I think that the Sci-Fi channel original movies have better effects than what was employed here.It's also a pity to note that director Russell Mulcahy comes fresh off of helming the successful third entry, ""Resident Evil: Extinction"", in the popular zombie franchise to directing this Direct-to-DVD piece of garbage. Now, I'm not trying to insinuate that I feel like Russell is an A-list director at all; in fact, I don't think he will ever compare to the likes of Steven Spielberg or Martin Scorcese, but regardless of that, he still is a decent enough Hollywood director that has had his fair share of successes that he deserved better than to be directing this movie. If Russell chose this as his next movie of his own free will then that's one thing, I personally would be shocked if that were the case, and would have to seriously question the judgment of a person who would willingly subject themselves to the kind of criticism this movie will draw from critics and movie fans alike. It is possible that whoever convinced Russell Mulcahy to direct this movie made the concept sound a heck of a lot better than the end result ever could hope to be, and if so, then kudos to whoever did the selling, because whatever you said worked and you managed to get a decent Hollywood director to really demean himself by working on a project as pathetic as this one.The cast for this movie was comprised of relative newcomers to the industry, several of them did have previous movie experience, but not much and what little they had wasn't all that impressive to be worth mentioning. For instance, the actual star of the movie (even though he doesn't get top-billing), Michael Copon, his biggest claim to movie fame was the third installment in the `Bring It On' franchise (a franchise that apparently will not go away) with ""Bring It On: In It to Win It"". I must point out that Michael was a good choice for the role because he does appear to be a decent enough resemblance to The Rock to pass off as a believable younger version of the first film's star. Getting top-billing for this movie, even though he only appears in maybe half of the movie, is UFC star Randy Couture. Days before watching this movie, I had seen Randy in David Mamet's ""Redbelt"" where he played a commentator for a fighting organization similar to UFC, and in that movie I thought that Randy showed some real potential to be a good actor; however, whatever potential I thought he had, was completely squandered by the time I saw his performance in this movie. Randy apparently didn't know how to effectively play the villainous role whatsoever, because there's nary a scene in which he isn't snarling or saying his lines in a menacing way, even if the line doesn't warrant that type of reading. With such a laughable performance as the one in this movie, I now feel that Randy has little to no hope for a future in Hollywood films, at least from my humble perspective.""The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior"" has got to be one of the most blatant, and poorly executed, attempts at cashing in on a theatrical release that I have seen go directly to DVD in a long time. The writing is horrible, the acting is sub-par at best, and the visual effects are possibly worse than an episode of The Power Rangers on TV. There is nothing much to praise with this prequel other than these two points; 1) Michael Copon was a good casting choice and did an alright job with the role, and 2) the movie does eventually end after an overly bloated, almost two hour long running time; so that those who were like me, and suffered through every moment of this crap, can eventually begin to work on putting the experience out of their minds. Perhaps some therapy could help, who knows.""The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior"" is rated PG-13 for violence and sensuality.",1,This King's Reign Should Come to an End Soon...,1220486400,"09 4,

1168533,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B001AV3BXG,Tim Janson,"[1, 3]","Scorpion King 2:  Rise of a Warrior is a prequel to the original film, telling the story of  Mathayus (the role played by Duane ""The Rock"" Johnson in the first film) as a young man.  He is trained to become one of the feared Black Scorpion mercenaries.  Returning home, Mathayus finds that Sargon, the man who killed his father, is the new Akkadian King, alleged to have murdered the previous King Hammurabi.  Mathayus vows revenge against Sargon (played by UFC champion Randy Couture) and attempts to kill him.  Sargon, however, has sorcery to aid him and Mathayus finds himself on the run with his childhood friend and love, Layla (Karen David).Onboard a ship they meet Aristophanes, a Greek scribe, who tells them about the legendary Sword of Damocles that can cut through anything.  The trio sets off on a quest to find the sword located in the Greek Underworld.  Along the way they will pickup a group of former prisoners as allies, battle a Minotaur, and take on the Goddess Astarte to try and claim the weapon.  The story climaxes in a battle between Mathayus and Sargon, who has transformed himself into a giant scorpion.Historically accurate Scorpion King 2 is not.  The first film is said to take place before the time of the pyramids and yet when Mathayus meets Aristophanes, the Greek tells them he's on his way to Egypt to ""see the pyramids"".  Sargon and Hammurabi are both well-known figures from ancient history.  Sargon indeed was King of Akkad and his rule fits into the general time period of the film, roughly 2250 BC.  Hammurabi, however, was not around until some 500 years later.  This period is also about a thousand years before the rise of ancient Greece so Aristophanes' presence is completely out of place.The Scorpion King 2 is one of those films that are so brazen in its ""badness"" that it is actually good.  There's no attempt to make the dialogue sound authentic and modern slang is used throughout the movie.  Like the first film, it doesn't take itself serious at all, although I'm not sure all of the humor was intentional.Couture accounts himself quite well.  He's not asked to do much other than to growl and play the bullying king but he's not as wooden as you might think.  Mathayus is played by Michael Copon, best known for playing the Blue Power Ranger in Power Rangers: Time Force.  He's not a physically imposing as The Rock but he's got a solid physique and admirably carries the role of the younger character.  Karen David is a lovely actress of Indian descent and while she doesn't look Middle-Eastern, she has an exotic look that fits the part..What was particularly impressive for a direct-to-video film was the quality of the set design.  The ancient city of Akkad looks good, even if it does seem like they run down the same street every time.  Scorpion King 2 is not a great movie...it's not even good, really, but it is cheesy, campy fun filled with action and ridiculous yet amusing dialogue and characters.
