1494561,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005MUOYB4,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 3]","Often cited as the worst director cranking out movies today, the notorious Uwe Boll returns with the sophisticated and stylish ""Blubberella."" Did I say sophisticated and stylish? I meant puerile and offensive. But that's okay! If the title didn't clue you in, this isn't really something meant to be taken seriously. Boll and company embrace their film's aggressive badness and (for a change) everyone seems to be in on the joke. Continuing the themes he began with the classic 2010 ""BloodRayne: The Third Reich,"" Boll once again mines the atrocities of World War Two for his filmmaking inspiration. And if you've been looking for some Holocaust humor, this might be right up your alley. While every Boll film has unintentional laughs, ""Blubberella"" plays as straight comedy (whether or not you find it funny, however, is another story). The picture starts as sort of an everything but the kitchen sink type of parody (kind of like the witless genre inhabited by films such as Epic Movie, Date Movie, Disaster Movie, etc) and eventually tries to pull off a Mel Brooks style satire. Truthfully, though, the film lacks any genuine cleverness and goes for the cheap shot every time.Blubberella (played by the game Lindsay Hollister) is a plus-sized half-vampire in 1940's Germany. It's a rather anachronistic setting, however, with plenty of gibes at modern day pop culture. Hollister is relatively clueless about the country's political climate and her online dating life is confounded when her hook-ups keep getting sent to concentration camps. She meets up with a team of resistance fighters led by a studly Brendan Fletcher and the flamboyant Willam Belli (named rather delightfully Vadge). One of the on-going jokes is that both Belli and Hollister want to sex up Fletcher and he seems pretty open-minded to just about any configuration. But personal considerations must wait as the team must wage battle with an evil Commandant (Michael Pare), his lieutenant (Steffen Mennekes) and a mad doctor (Clint Howard). While advertised as sort of a superhero movie, this is certainly not that. While angled as a vampire story, it barely registers that Blubberella herself is one. It is, as I said, more of a mish mash of juvenile comic antics.If you are a Boll fan, obviously you will not want to miss this one. The first five minutes of the movie has enough bad taste to weed out the more sensitive of viewers. No one will ever contend that Boll was attempting to make a good movie here--but I'm not sure how much extra credit to give a film that aspires to be bad and succeeds. Some may claim this is brilliantly bad, but I'm not so sure. I think the film had the potential to be a cult classic, but too much of the humor falls flat to really qualify. If you're going with the cheap shot of naming your movie ""Blubberella,"" than embrace the idea of that character and actually make it funny. If the movie had a consistent tone and didn't feel made up as it went along, it would have been much better for the effort. Again, Boll fans unite and rejoice! All others, be wary.

An overly offensive spoof that tries to hard at what it does, Boll's Blubberella is extreme badness, but surprisingly watchable here and there.  Using the same scenes, actors, and sets from BloodRayne 3, Boll presents the tale of an obese human/vampire (Lindsay Hollister) as she fights Nazis and her own girth.  Sometimes it's funny, sometimes it definitely isn't, sometimes you'll just hang your head in shame and wonder just why you're watching this.

1494564,A357H3W52835OK,B005MUOYB4,Vampyre Mike,"[3, 4]","I've seen some bad movies in my time, and usually I find something appealing in most of Mr. Boll's films. Was House of the Dead any good? Not really, but being a fan of the game(s) we got a good laugh out of it. How about In the Name of the King? Nope, but we are suckers for Statham. Stoic? I thought that was a damn decent flick, same with Rampage...And the list goes on and on.I thought to myself, I've seen quite a few of his films, it can't really be un-watchable. It was. This is the first Uwe Boll movie I had shut off due to boredom and stupidity. The jokes are just a ton of fat, and sex jokes. Distasteful can be funny, these just border on stupid and lack any humor.The plot is crazy and goes all over the place but the main focal point is the half vampire plump heroine (Blubberella) and her quest to save the Jews in Nazi Germany. She eventually plays a board game with Hitler and a white man in black face sits and makes remarks. I kid you not, that's in the film. And it may sound funny, but the idea went no where fast. By the way, Uwe Boll the creator of this film is Hitler in the movie =)The characters aren't very good or funny, and I feel slightly bad for the main actress because no matter how happy she is with herself, all the fat jokes must be sort of demeaning. At least slightly.That being said, I usually like his movies, but boy was this terrible. This movie was filmed in conjunction with Blood Rayne 3, they even reused the sets and costumes and the like where they could. They would have been better off not. I love B movies, and brash humor. This movie is just so painfully boring and stupid that I couldn't take it any longer. I suggest you watch anything else.
