An in-depth analysis and critique of the songs, the various members of Wings besides Paul and Linda, and the process of making the albums could have made me look a bit more kindly on his music and not be so inclined to dismiss it as cheesy lightweight meaningless pop, as many of his critics do.  That opportunity was wasted and squandered here.  This so-called documentary is little more than the story of Paul, Linda, and their family.  What material there is on the actual music is disappointingly brief and shallow.  We barely learn anything at all about the other members of Wings, and their names are barely even mentioned at all.  Why in the world weren't there any other people interviewed for this project, particularly Denny Laine, the only bandmember who was there the entire time?  Their perspective would have enhanced the viewer's understanding and appreciation of the music a lot, and made the story not seem so terribly one-sided.  This only confirms what just about everyone has known all along, that Wings were little more than a backup band for Paul.Having Paul's daughter Mary interview him is barely a step up from someone interviewing oneself.  Was he afraid that a less impartial and fawning source would have asked harder-hitting and more specific questions?  I'll admit it was really sweet to see the interactions between father and daughter, but it's just not very professional to have your own child interview you.  Naturally, she'll avoid questions that might cast her beloved father or his music in a less than perfect light, because of how close she is to the subject.  And I totally call BS on Mary's stunned reaction to being told that Yoko moved her bed into the studio while The Beatles were recording the White Album.  We're supposed to believe the child of an actual Beatle never heard such a well-known story ever before in her life?In spite of how the focus is almost entirely on the McCartneys' family life and not the music, and the rather kid-glove treatment of Paul and the late Linda, I did enjoy seeing all of the home movie footage.  Whatever I might think about his solo music (and his inclusion of his less-than-musically-gifted wife in the act), it's obvious that Paul provided his kids with a really happy stable loving family life growing up.  The footage of a few songs in the bonus material is also nice, as are the clips of videos we see in the actual body of the film.  It's just unfortunate that this material couldn't have been assembled by people who weren't so close to the source and who had interviewed other people, not just Paul and using audio clips from Linda.",3,Severely lacking perspective,1216080000,"07 15, 2008",2008,2840,"[""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'biggest', 'fan', 'most', 'Paul', 'solo', 'music', 'favorite', 'solo', 'Beatle', 'George', 'supposed', 'documentary', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'potential', 'change', 'opinion', 'solo', 'career', 'better', 'in-depth', 'analysis', 'critique', 'songs', 'various', 'members', 'Wings', 'Paul', 'Linda', 'process', 'making', 'albums', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'look', 'bit', 'more', 'kindly', 'music', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'inclined', 'dismiss', 'cheesy', 'lightweight', 'meaningless', 'pop', 'many', 'critics', 'do', 'opportunity', 'was', 'wasted', 'squandered', 'here', 'so-called', 'documentary', 'little', 'more', 'story', 'Paul', 'Linda', 'family', 'What', 'material', 'actual', 'music', 'disappointingly', 'brief', 'shallow', 'barely', 'learn', 'anything', 'other', 'members', 'Wings', 'names', 'are', 'barely', 'even', 'mentioned', 'Why', 'world', 'were', ""n't"", 'there', 'other', 'people', 'interviewed', 'project', 'particularly', 'Denny', 'Laine', 'only', 'bandmember', 'who', 'was', 'entire', 'time', 'perspective', 'would', 'have', 'enhanced', 'viewer', 'understanding', 'appreciation', 'music', 'lot', 'made', 'story', 'not', 'seem', 'so', 'terribly', 'one-sided', 'only', 'what', 'just', 'everyone', 'known', 'along', 'Wings', 'were', 'little', 'more', 'backup', 'band', 'Paul.Having', 'Paul', 'daughter', 'Mary', 'interview', 'barely', 'step', 'up', 'someone', 'interviewing', 'afraid', 'less', 'impartial', 'fawning', 'source', 'would', 'have', 'asked', 'harder-hitting', 'more', 'specific', 'questions', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'was', 'really', 'sweet', 'see', 'interactions', 'father', 'daughter', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'professional', 'have', 'own', 'child', 'interview', 'Naturally', ""'ll"", 'avoid', 'questions', 'might', 'cast', 'beloved', 'father', 'music', 'less', 'perfect', 'light', 'how', 'close', 'subject', 'totally', 'call', 'BS', 'Mary', 'stunned', 'reaction', 'being', 'told', 'Yoko', 'moved', 'bed', 'studio', 'Beatles', 'were', 'recording', 'White', 'Album', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'child', 'actual', 'Beatle', 'never', 'heard', 'such', 'well-known', 'story', 'ever', 'before', 'life', 'spite', 'how', 'focus', 'almost', 'entirely', 'McCartneys', 'family', 'life', 'not', 'music', 'rather', 'kid-glove', 'treatment', 'Paul', 'late', 'Linda', 'did', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'home', 'movie', 'footage', 'might', 'think', 'solo', 'music', 'inclusion', 'less-than-musically-gifted', 'wife', 'act', 'obvious', 'Paul', 'provided', 'kids', 'really', 'happy', 'stable', 'loving', 'family', 'life', 'growing', 'up', 'footage', 'few', 'songs', 'bonus', 'material', 'also', 'nice', 'are', 'clips', 'videos', 'see', 'actual', 'body', 'film', 'just', 'unfortunate', 'material', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'assembled', 'people', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'close', 'source', 'who', 'had', 'interviewed', 'other', 'people', 'not', 'just', 'Paul', 'using', 'audio', 'clips', 'Linda']",Paul McCartney - Wingspan - An Intimate Portrait

675307,A2VKJOBZEZJ2A0,B00005QJHL,David A. Bede,"[3, 3]","The worst thing I can say about Wingspan is that the title is misleading.  I suspect McCartney and his daughter intended to make a documentary about Wings but ended up with one about Paul and Linda instead.  But that's okay, although they should have changed the name of the DVD.The best feature of Wingspan is that Paul, for once, is remarkably articulate in the interview sections.  The questions are more intimate than you might expect from his own daughter, too.  It can't have been easy for him to talk with her about such issues as the drug bust in Japan - but he does it, apparently quite honestly.  I also loved the early films and stories of the retreat in Scotland immediately before and after the Beatles broke up, and the first Wings tour.  The shots of the 1976 American tour are also terrific - if there's enough footage of those shows for a full-length DVD, everyone who sees this will want to buy it.  Just sayin', guys.  While most fans will already know some of the stories he tells, there are several here that I've never heard before, notably the origin of ""Mrs. Vanderbilt"" and the reggae bridge in ""Live and Let Die.""  I also came away with a lot more respect for Linda after watching this, even if the fact remains that she couldn't sing.What's not so good is the discussion of the other members of Wings and the band's work as a whole - which, after all, is apparently what the show was supposed to be about in the first place.  With occasional exceptions, the talk about the songs is fairly cursory, and this is even more true when it comes to the musicians.  Denny Laine, the only constant member of Wings besides Paul and Linda (and, on two occasions, the only other member of the band) doesn't get anywhere near the screen time he warrants.  Some of the other members literally only get one mention in passing.  Then again, that is an accurate reflection of how long they were in the group!  Their best-selling album, ""Wings at the Speed of Sound,"" isn't discussed at all and only about a minute's worth of it is even used as background music.  (I can't help wondering if this is Paul and Mary's way of acknowledging that, big as it was, it's not a very good album.)  During the segment on the 1976 tour, he recites a rather obnoxious nursery rhyme he made up in response to questions about a Beatles reunion - without ever mentioning that Ringo turned up at one of the shows and he seemed quite happy about it at the time.  I'd love to know why he left that out.Overall, the good outweighs the bad.

Wings was a performing and recording band, they played concerts and made records.  But what is also impossible to argue, Linda McCartney's actual contributions to either live shows or records was minimal.  Those records and shows rested in the hands of Paul and his able band of musicians.What's disappointing is how little we really know of the MUSIC of Wings from this DVD.  How little of the musicians, how they came into the group, what became of them, how they contributed.  That's a real shame; they worked hard to keep up with an ex-Beatle, to do him and themselves proud, and make records that could stand up to the legacy of Paul McCartney.Instead, we get to know more about Linda McCartney than perhaps we really need to know.  It's no surprise that their love was incredibly strong - we've known that all along, they were very open, public and direct about that.  And her impact on his life was, without question, immeasurable.  But, it is also fair to say that her direct impact on the music of Wings was VERY measurable, and the overemphasis on her contributions defeats the thesis of this program.It's unfair to diminish Linda McCartney's place in the life of her famous husband, but it's equally unfair to overshadow with her memory the fine collaborations of the various members of Wings.

A little tribute to the late Jimmy McCulloch would have been cool... etc., etc.Now, if you are a Paul McCartney and Wings fan, you WILL find this entertaining and worthwhile. It just could have been much more. The extra interview out-takes are, for the most part, not all that exciting. However, you do get to hear Paul sing &quot;Picasso's Last Words&quot; to his daughter. That would have been enough as far as &quot;out-takes&quot;.... and the three videos included are cool.

675313,A1PVM3V959JFYM,B00005QJHL,Lovely to See You,"[4, 7]","ABC ran this as a television special a few years ago, and it was memorable enough to stick in my head until I finally ordered it last week.  Starting with the sad, jaded ending of the Beatles and his marriage to Linda Eastman, this is a great rockumentary fans of McCartney from any era of his career will want to pick up.  Linda was a great accompaniment to both the man's music and his personal life.  If you need further proof of that than this musical bio, I suggest you read Many Years From Now by Barry Miles or Blackbird by Geoffrey Giuliano.An often undeservedly persecuted group, Wings spawned an impressive credential of hit singles and albums during the 70s that rival all the animosity and, to be fair to Linda, she was no Yoko.  Paul WANTED her to be in his group, so he taught her how to play keyboards.  Her presence was also appreciated--not resented--by the other Wings members.It is amazing to see all the footage that was captured over the years of the McCartney family and the group, and it's great to view it all--and some pleasant extras here.  What really impresses me is that Mary (allegedly Paul's favorite daughter), who bears a striking resemblance to him was chosen to interview him for the special.  You can see how relaxed he is with her and how obvious it is that they have a great father daughter relationship.  A journey full of personal warmth, great music, and visual insight that makes you feel like you're an insider, this is a great DVD bio for any McCartney fan's collection.  On a personal note, I would like to say thank you, Macca, for such a priviledge.",5,Thoroughly Enjoyable.,1141862400,"03 9, 2006",2006,1596,"['ABC', 'ran', 'television', 'special', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'memorable', 'enough', 'stick', 'head', 'finally', 'ordered', 'last', 'week', 'Starting', 'sad', 'jaded', 'ending', 'Beatles', 'marriage', 'Linda', 'Eastman', 'great', 'rockumentary', 'fans', 'McCartney', 'era', 'career', 'will', 'want', 'pick', 'up', 'Linda', 'was', 'great', 'accompaniment', 'man', 'music', 'personal', 'life', 'need', 'further', 'proof', 'musical', 'bio', 'suggest', 'read', 'Many', 'Years', 'Now', 'Barry', 'Miles', 'Blackbird', 'Geoffrey', 'Giuliano.An', 'often', 'undeservedly', 'persecuted', 'group', 'Wings', 'spawned', 'impressive', 'credential', 'hit', 'singles', 'albums', '70s', 'rival', 'animosity', 'be', 'fair', 'Linda', 'was', 'Yoko', 'Paul', 'WANTED', 'be', 'group', 'taught', 'how', 'play', 'keyboards', 'presence', 'was', 'also', 'appreciated', 'not', 'resented', 'other', 'Wings', 'members.It', 'amazing', 'see', 'footage', 'was', 'captured', 'years', 'McCartney', 'family', 'group', 'great', 'view', 'pleasant', 'extras', 'here', 'What', 'really', 'Mary', 'allegedly', 'Paul', 'favorite', 'daughter', 'who', 'striking', 'resemblance', 'was', 'chosen', 'interview', 'special', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'relaxed', 'how', 'obvious', 'have', 'great', 'father', 'daughter', 'relationship', 'journey', 'full', 'personal', 'warmth', 'great', 'music', 'visual', 'insight', 'feel', ""'re"", 'insider', 'great', 'DVD', 'bio', 'McCartney', 'fan', 'collection', 'personal', 'note', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'thank', 'Macca', 'priviledge']",Paul McCartney - Wingspan - An Intimate Portrait
675314,A1WLZYEOIL1HLT,B00005QJHL,"Michael King ""Mike""","[29, 32]","For this ""rockumentary,"" Paul McCartney is interviewed by his daughter. He is very playful and relaxed, given his familiarity with the interviewer. At the beginning of the program we witness the dissolution of the Beatles and the marriage of Paul and Linda. Interestingly, none of the other Beatles were in attendance at the hastily arranged nuptials. Later, Paul wonders if he can make it as a solo artist. After releasing a couple of solo albums, he decides to form a new band. His wife Linda would be a member of the group, even though she had little musical experience. Paul admired Denny Laine's guitar playing and singing with the Moody Blues.  Denny was asked to join his new group Wings. As it turned out, Denny Laine was the ONLY member of Wings to stay with the group from start to finish, other than Linda. However, his musical contributions - what songs he wrote and sang on, or contributed a guitar solo to - are never discussed. Mr. Laine was not interviewed for this DVD, nor are any clips of old interviews with him included. Other band members are only mentioned in passing although, to be fair, most only lasted with Wings a short time.As Paul said near the end of the program, he proved that he could have major hits and successful world tours with another band after the Beatles. After Paul's infamous drug bust in Japan, he felt that it was time to give everything a rest. Thus Wings ended, not with a bang but with a whimper. Surprisingly, there is no booklet or even an insert included with the DVD. The extras include complete live performances of two songs - ""Jet"" and ""Let 'Em In"" - as well as the studio session for the instrumental ""Rockestra."" The discography contains mistakes; when you click on the song list for ""Wings Over America"" it displays the song list for ""Wings At The Speed Of Sound.""

675316,A1T5OK7UIIZC3W,B00005QJHL,"Mike S ""mike""","[8, 11]","First, I'm a big fan of the Beatles, Paul, and Wings.  All artists have their hits and misses.  And this mockumentary is a miss.  As others have stated, this is the story of Paul & Linda McCartney from 1969 to the 1980s, and not about the group Wings 1971-1979.  What does the breakup of the Beatles, or Paul and Linda's marriage have to do with Wings?  It's odd that Paul starts by saying how he wanted to form a band after the Beatles, then basically ends up proving it never really was a band.  He rarely even mentions a band member by name!  It's usually ""the guitarist"" or ""the drummer""- as if it was whoever happened to be there.  This just comes across as a commercial for Paul by Paul, as most of his videos do.For an ""inside documentary"" I didn't hear anything I didn't already know.  And I don't think you will either.  Most fans already know that Paul, Linda and Denny recorded Band on the Run after the first guitarist and drummer quit.  What we want to hear is why?  And not just Paul's version, how about asking the band members themselves?I think Paul ends up answering the question unwittingly:  They were probably tired of being ignored and the whole thing being about Paul.  Oh this was Paul's show the whole way alright- no question about it- and this proves it.  But we already knew that.  So what does this documentary accomplish?  Not much.  It's as if it's designed for someone who know's nothing about Paul (Really? he was in the Beatles before Wings?  His wife was in Wings too?)Not enough music, either.  What would have made this documentary work would be a year to year review, with Band members and others, discussing how songs were written and recorded, the concerts, the ""behind the scenes"" relationships of the band mambers, etc.  This DVD is an insult to Wings members and fans.  I'm left with a DVD that was mildly interesting to watch once.
