744637,A2XRZV63X79YSJ,B00008L3V9,"Movie Mania ""DVD Collector""","[35, 35]","County and The River came out virtually simultaneously.  They have the same theme, farms in crisis.  The main difference is Country is more political in nature.Country is not a true story but is based on a number of true stories.  This film is about a family owned farm that is in trouble.  This trouble was not really their fault.  It was a combination of changing economies and a pullout of government funding. During the 70's, the government threw loans to the farmers, encouraging farmers to overextend themselves.  In the 80's, when crop prices plummeted, the  government foreclosed on the farms.  This made way for large corporate farmers to buy them for pennies on the dollar.Real life husband and wife, Jessica Lange and Sam Sheppard, play the Jewel and Gil Ivey.  They have a farm and government loans.  When they can't make the harvest payment, the bank forecloses on the farm.  Jewel is determined not to lose the farm.This is tour de force performance by Jessica Lange.  Wilford Brimley plays her curmudgeon father and gives a perfectly measured performance.  This would become his signature character that he would be cast as for the remainder of his career.Richard Pearce's direction and William Witliff's screenplay keep the film from getting to preachy or too sentimental.  This is the best film made on the subject of the farm loan crisis.DVD EXTRAS: None",5,Jessica vs the Government,1134864000,"12 18, 2005",2005,1372,"['County', 'River', 'came', 'out', 'virtually', 'simultaneously', 'have', 'same', 'theme', 'farms', 'crisis', 'main', 'difference', 'Country', 'more', 'political', 'nature.Country', 'not', 'true', 'story', 'based', 'number', 'true', 'stories', 'film', 'family', 'owned', 'farm', 'trouble', 'trouble', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'fault', 'was', 'combination', 'changing', 'economies', 'pullout', 'government', 'funding', '70', 'government', 'threw', 'loans', 'farmers', 'encouraging', 'farmers', 'overextend', '80', 'when', 'crop', 'prices', 'plummeted', 'government', 'foreclosed', 'farms', 'made', 'way', 'large', 'corporate', 'farmers', 'buy', 'pennies', 'dollar.Real', 'life', 'husband', 'wife', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'Sam', 'Sheppard', 'play', 'Jewel', 'Gil', 'Ivey', 'have', 'farm', 'government', 'loans', 'When', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'harvest', 'payment', 'bank', 'farm', 'Jewel', 'determined', 'not', 'lose', 'farm.This', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'performance', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'Wilford', 'Brimley', 'curmudgeon', 'father', 'perfectly', 'measured', 'performance', 'would', 'become', 'signature', 'character', 'would', 'be', 'cast', 'remainder', 'career.Richard', 'Pearce', 'direction', 'William', 'Witliff', 'screenplay', 'keep', 'film', 'getting', 'preachy', 'too', 'sentimental', 'best', 'film', 'made', 'subject', 'farm', 'loan', 'crisis.DVD', 'EXTRAS', 'None']",N/A

While the work is hard and the earnings are slim, the Ivys have been able to get by, like most of their neighbors, until a one-two punch threatens to devastate the Iowa farming community. First, a tornado devastates the area, then the Farmers Home Administration calls in the loans on most of the farmers in the area, which they are in no position to repay. With thirty days to voluntarily liquidate their property, the Ivys, like most of their friends and neighbors, are desperate to find a way to hold on to their property, and when the stress causes Gil to buckle, Jewell must step in to keep the clan going. A well acted insight into the farming crisis of the mid 80s.
