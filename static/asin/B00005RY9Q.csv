680389,AE8W6OW6A1M5M,B00005RY9Q,Ibochild,"[5, 5]","Rather than make BOYCOTT another boring history lesson, the filmmakers have wisely chosen to take the characters off the mantlepiece and allow them to breathe and feel like human beings. Dr. Martin Luther King is not just a dynamic minister, supporting a noble cause, he's also a man with a young wife and family. He has feelings and is vulnerable. This allows the film to have a greater impact than did past films about King, because here the audience can better relate to him as a real person.The minute you hear Jeffrey Wright's voice as Dr. Martin Luther King, you can't help but be glued to the screen. Throughout the film, Wright effectively captures the essence of King. It's a dynamic performance that equals if not surpasses Denzel Washington's performance as Malcolm X.Others are also strong in the film. Carmen Ejogo is very effective and human in her role as Coretta Scott King. She's so convincing in her role, that you forget that this is the British-born actor that made her film debut as the little girl with the strong West Indian accent in ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS.Another standout is Erik Dellums as Bayard Rustin. As the gay radical that assisted in the boycott, Dellums brings to life a figure often ignored in the past.Canadian-born actor, Clark Johnson (best known for his role as Det. Meldrick Lewis on TV's &quot;Homicide&quot;) makes an auspicious feature length directing debut with this film. In addition to getting great performances from his cast, he effectively uses the visual aspects of film to help drive the narrative. At least some credit here must also be given to Herman Daniel Ferrell and Timothy J. Sexton, who adapted the book, DAYBREAK OF FREEDOM by Stewart Burns for the film. Particularly effective are the scenes immediately leading up to Rosa Parks's refusal to give up her seat to a white man. Iris Little-Thomas is also excellent in her role as Mrs. Parks.As in any film, you can nit-pick here and there. For one, the filmmakers have chosen to use a style of music on the soundtrack that didn't exist in the 1950s. Many of the actors don't physically resemble the real life figures that they portray (of course, that's usually the case anyway). The visual style of the film, while very effective at times borders on &quot;MTV-style&quot; flashy. However, for a film this powerful, these criticism are rendered insignificant.Overall, BOYCOTT is a fine film that explores an important part of American history with passion and depth. It just doesn't re-tell the story in purely academic fashion, it brings it to life. In short, BOYCOTT is a worthy addition to any film collection, particularly those with an interest in fact-based stories.",5,Jeffrey Wright is Riveting as Dr. Martin Luther King,1006819200,"11 27, 2001",2001,2679,"['Rather', 'make', 'BOYCOTT', 'boring', 'history', 'lesson', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'wisely', 'chosen', 'take', 'characters', 'mantlepiece', 'allow', 'breathe', 'feel', 'human', 'beings', 'Dr.', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'not', 'just', 'dynamic', 'minister', 'supporting', 'noble', 'cause', 'also', 'man', 'young', 'wife', 'family', 'feelings', 'vulnerable', 'film', 'have', 'greater', 'impact', 'did', 'past', 'films', 'King', 'here', 'audience', 'can', 'better', 'relate', 'real', 'person.The', 'minute', 'hear', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'voice', 'Dr.', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'glued', 'screen', 'film', 'Wright', 'effectively', 'essence', 'King', 'dynamic', 'performance', 'equals', 'not', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'performance', 'Malcolm', 'X.Others', 'are', 'also', 'strong', 'film', 'Carmen', 'Ejogo', 'very', 'effective', 'human', 'role', 'Coretta', 'Scott', 'King', 'so', 'convincing', 'role', 'forget', 'British-born', 'actor', 'made', 'film', 'debut', 'little', 'girl', 'strong', 'West', 'Indian', 'accent', 'ABSOLUTE', 'BEGINNERS.Another', 'standout', 'Erik', 'Dellums', 'Bayard', 'Rustin', 'gay', 'radical', 'assisted', 'boycott', 'Dellums', 'life', 'figure', 'often', 'ignored', 'past.Canadian-born', 'actor', 'Clark', 'Johnson', 'best', 'known', 'role', 'Det', 'Meldrick', 'Lewis', 'TV', 'quot', 'Homicide', 'quot', 'auspicious', 'feature', 'length', 'directing', 'debut', 'film', 'addition', 'getting', 'great', 'performances', 'cast', 'effectively', 'visual', 'aspects', 'film', 'help', 'drive', 'narrative', 'least', 'credit', 'here', 'must', 'also', 'be', 'given', 'Herman', 'Daniel', 'Ferrell', 'Timothy', 'J.', 'Sexton', 'who', 'adapted', 'book', 'DAYBREAK', 'OF', 'FREEDOM', 'Stewart', 'Burns', 'film', 'Particularly', 'effective', 'are', 'scenes', 'immediately', 'leading', 'up', 'Rosa', 'Parks', 'refusal', 'give', 'up', 'seat', 'white', 'man', 'Iris', 'Little-Thomas', 'also', 'excellent', 'role', 'Mrs.', 'Parks.As', 'film', 'can', 'nit-pick', 'here', 'there', 'one', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'chosen', 'use', 'style', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', '1950s', 'Many', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'physically', 'resemble', 'real', 'life', 'figures', 'portray', 'course', 'usually', 'case', 'anyway', 'visual', 'style', 'film', 'very', 'effective', 'times', 'borders', 'quot', 'MTV-style', 'quot', 'flashy', 'However', 'film', 'powerful', 'criticism', 'are', 'rendered', 'insignificant.Overall', 'BOYCOTT', 'fine', 'film', 'important', 'part', 'American', 'history', 'passion', 'depth', 'just', ""n't"", 're-tell', 'story', 'purely', 'academic', 'fashion', 'life', 'short', 'BOYCOTT', 'worthy', 'addition', 'film', 'collection', 'particularly', 'interest', 'fact-based', 'stories']",Boycott

680392,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005RY9Q,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[10, 11]","On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama so that a white passenger could sit down.  Her arrest for this act of civil disobedience sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott, one of the most significant and successful efforts against racial segregation in American history.  The HBO movie ""Boycott"" looks at what happened when the one-day boycott of the Montgomery buses called because of the Parks' arrest became a protracted effort that last more than a year.  The focus is not on Parks (Iris Little-Thomas), but on the young Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. (Jeffrey Wright), who becomes the spokesman for the boycott and had his first leadership role in the Civil Rights Movement.  However, while the focus in on King, the work of other leaders, such as Ralph Abernathy (Terrence Howard) and Jo Ann Robinson (CCH Pounder), as well as the ordinary citizens who walked to work and drove the car pools, are covered and honored as well.In watching how King becomes a leader be sure you continue to pay attention to how the city government of Montgomery tried to break the boycott, because there was a complexity to this struggle that goes beyond the simple idea that Negroes in the city stopped riding the bus.  The escalating efforts by the city not only served to solidify King's believes in the value of nonviolence, but also revealed the hypocrisy of using the law to enforce injustice.  There is also the interesting relationship between King and Bayard Rustin (Erik Todd Dellums), who actually sees King as failing to live up to Gandhi's example because there are armed men protecting Coretta Scott King (Carmen Ejogo) and his daughter.  King is a revered figure in the telling of this story, but he is not turned into a walking saint, and neither the writing nor Wright's performance tries to make him anything more than a man trying to make the boycott work against great odds, and the concern of Daddy King (Mike Hodge) for his son's safety foreshadow's King's assassination in 1968, even though I think few viewers will not have his fate always in the back of their mind while watching ""Boycott.""  The only serious complaint is that the movie seems to end somewhat abruptly because what turns out to be the straw that breaks the camel's back does not strike us as such at the time, so when victory is achieved it comes as something of a surprise.Writers Herman Daniel Farrell and Timothy J. Sexton, working from Stewart Burns' book ""Daybreak of Freedom,"" come up with creative ways to keep things movie in a movie that is about a boycott that lasts over 380-days (the exact number is in dispute).  You might think there would be a problem in showing people not riding a bus, but seeing the Negroes of Montgomery walking and car pooling to get to work becomes a potent series of images.  We also have folks on both sides of the issue addressing the camera with what constitute quick asides that give a sense of what people were thinking, which includes some rather ugly thoughts.  The bit of creativity where what Rosa Parks was thinking before her fateful moment in history, consisting of images seen on the window of the bus, is not repeated.  If you watch ""Boycott"" again after exhausting the special features, most of which require you to go frame by frame to read about the people and times, you will understand more of what is happening in the various montages that tie scenes together.  This is important becuase ""Boycott"" is trying to be educational as well as inspirational.",5,"The story of Rev.

The black (Negro) community immediately reacts with what they think will be a short boycott of the public transportation system. It turns into a 381 marathon of wills between the black community and the whites who want to preserve the status quo. How they did that is the story of this HBO film. There were many times when the boycott could have fallen apart. Many of the blacks did not have cars and relied on public transportation to get to work, often quite a distance from their segregated communities. It is a remarkable story of perseverance, hope and faith. Jeffrey Wright as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. carries the movie but there are impressive supporting performances as well that keep this story moving and entertaining. It is doubtful that any of us can see and learn too much about this ugly part of our country's history.

He caught my attention and I was riveted to every scene he was in.  Wright as Dr. King was a strike of genius.  He nails the performance with conviction and compassion.  Wright steals every scene he appears in.  The project as a whole is very impressive and I commend HBO for investing in this and other projects in which the lives and interests of African Americans are the focus.  Terrence Howard is also a figure to watch out for in the future.  Howard's performance is powerful especially with his facial expressions.  Carmen Ejogo's performance is warm and supportive to the Dr. King character.  In playing her part though, she was able to emote what she feels for her husband as she and Wright are real life husband and wife.There is one moment in this film where Dr. King is overcome with fear and prays to God for strength and it is one of Wright's strongest scenes.  It shows exaclty the fear that one might feel if suddenly realizing that you might not live to long just because of standing forwhat was right.  Wright's speeches are very King like and in delivering his lines, Wright takes on a slowness of speech that was characteristic of the way Dr. King spoke.  He spoke slowly as to give thought first to every word before before it was uttered.I do find at times that the handheld camera is a bit much and can be a distraction but it can be easily overlooked.I urge you to buy this film and watch it with your children.

680397,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,B00005RY9Q,The Mysterious Traveler,"[2, 4]","BOYCOTT (2001) Directed by Clark Johnson.Starring Jeffrey Wright (as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr), TerranceHoward (as Ralph Abernathy), Carmen Ejogo (as Coretta Scott King), IrisLittle Thomas (as Rosa Parks) and Erik Dellums as Bayard Rustin.The story of the 1954-5 Montgomery, Alabama Bus Boycott by the Blacksof that city in protest against the company's discriminatory practices.The boycott is considered the beginning of the Civil Right Movement andfirst brought into prominence as leader the Reverend Martin LutherKing. Jr.Unlike most HBO historical efforts, one is very pleased to report thatthis is a near perfect dramatization of a pivotal event in the 1950sand United States history. While there are some quibbles---which willbe noted in a bit---it appears that someone prevented HBO from ruiningthings with their usual anti-American leftist poisonous rubbish andthus miraculously a solid historical film was produced from a generallydubious source. Since this IS a HBO production, it is shown Kingreceiving bad advice from his friends, family and associates until anex-communist homosexual shows up to set him straight. However sincesaid commie Gay is played superbly by Dellums who smokes up a storm inan oddly non-smoking 1955 world, it was hard to be too annoyed at theever racist liberal idea that Blacks---even Martin Luther King--- arehelpless without The Party to explain it all to them in nice easyphrases. Also Thomas' performance as Rosa Parks is a creepy mistake.One kept expecting the glaze eyed fanatical looking actress to reachinto her handbag, pull out a large butcher knife, start shrieking ""Iwill get you my pretty."" and begin slashing away. If this is accurateportrayal of Parks--which one hopes not--- no wonder they kept her inthe background and had King be the front manAnother mistake is the director's tendency to have crowds of Blacksstaring into the camera. It IS intended to be accusatory towards thepresumably white viewers but the effect is to make them look like a mobabout to kill the first honky they see. The smugness quotient in thesescenes is a little too high and will probably become more noticeable tothe film's detriment as it ages. There is also a poor scene near theend with King walking in the modern world and getting down with somebrothers apparently sending the message that King speaks to the Blackyouth of today...............which if they have not figured out hisgigantic importance by this point in the picture, they certainly arenot going to be persuaded by a couple of high fives. It is rather sadthat such a scene was even thought necessary.However the above are, as said, just quibbles. Minor bumps on agenerally pleasing freedom ride. The photography, sets, costumes andperiod feel are well night perfect. Johnson's direction is mostlyinspired. The performances are........Thomas being theexception.....perfect. Wright is particularly fine as King. Truly aniconic piece of acting that one sees all too rarely these days.This film, along with the miniseries KING, are the definitive works onthe life of Dr. Martin Luther King. All that can be said cinematicallyabout the man has now been said. They are both that good.Highly recommended.",4,A Near Classic,1280707200,"08 2, 2010",2010,3198,"['BOYCOTT', '2001', 'Directed', 'Clark', 'Johnson.Starring', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'Dr.', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'Jr', 'TerranceHoward', 'Ralph', 'Abernathy', 'Carmen', 'Ejogo', 'Coretta', 'Scott', 'King', 'IrisLittle', 'Thomas', 'Rosa', 'Parks', 'Erik', 'Dellums', 'Bayard', 'Rustin.The', 'story', '1954-5', 'Montgomery', 'Alabama', 'Bus', 'Boycott', 'Blacksof', 'city', 'protest', 'company', 'discriminatory', 'practices.The', 'boycott', 'considered', 'beginning', 'Civil', 'Right', 'Movement', 'andfirst', 'brought', 'prominence', 'leader', 'Reverend', 'Martin', 'LutherKing', 'Jr.Unlike', 'most', 'HBO', 'historical', 'efforts', 'one', 'very', 'pleased', 'report', 'thatthis', 'near', 'perfect', 'dramatization', 'pivotal', 'event', '1950sand', 'United', 'States', 'history', 'are', 'quibbles', '-which', 'willbe', 'noted', 'bit', '-it', 'someone', 'prevented', 'HBO', 'ruiningthings', 'usual', 'anti-American', 'leftist', 'poisonous', 'rubbish', 'andthus', 'miraculously', 'solid', 'historical', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'generallydubious', 'source', 'HBO', 'production', 'shown', 'Kingreceiving', 'bad', 'advice', 'friends', 'family', 'associates', 'anex-communist', 'homosexual', 'up', 'set', 'straight', 'However', 'sincesaid', 'commie', 'Gay', 'played', 'superbly', 'Dellums', 'who', 'up', 'storm', 'inan', 'oddly', 'non-smoking', '1955', 'world', 'was', 'hard', 'be', 'too', 'annoyed', 'theever', 'racist', 'liberal', 'idea', 'Blacks', '-even', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'arehelpless', 'Party', 'explain', 'nice', 'easyphrases', 'Also', 'Thomas', 'performance', 'Rosa', 'Parks', 'creepy', 'mistake.One', 'kept', 'expecting', 'glaze', 'eyed', 'fanatical', 'looking', 'actress', 'reachinto', 'handbag', 'pull', 'out', 'large', 'butcher', 'knife', 'start', 'shrieking', 'Iwill', 'get', 'pretty', 'begin', 'slashing', 'away', 'accurateportrayal', 'Parks', 'one', 'not', 'wonder', 'kept', 'inthe', 'background', 'had', 'King', 'be', 'front', 'manAnother', 'mistake', 'director', 'tendency', 'have', 'crowds', 'Blacksstaring', 'camera', 'intended', 'be', 'accusatory', 'towards', 'thepresumably', 'white', 'viewers', 'effect', 'make', 'look', 'mobabout', 'kill', 'first', 'honky', 'see', 'smugness', 'quotient', 'thesescenes', 'little', 'too', 'high', 'will', 'probably', 'become', 'more', 'noticeable', 'tothe', 'film', 'detriment', 'also', 'poor', 'scene', 'theend', 'King', 'walking', 'modern', 'world', 'getting', 'down', 'somebrothers', 'apparently', 'sending', 'message', 'King', 'speaks', 'Blackyouth', 'today', 'have', 'not', 'figured', 'out', 'hisgigantic', 'importance', 'point', 'picture', 'certainly', 'arenot', 'going', 'be', 'persuaded', 'couple', 'high', 'fives', 'rather', 'sadthat', 'such', 'scene', 'was', 'even', 'thought', 'necessary.However', 'above', 'are', 'said', 'just', 'quibbles', 'Minor', 'bumps', 'agenerally', 'pleasing', 'freedom', 'ride', 'photography', 'sets', 'costumes', 'andperiod', 'feel', 'are', 'well', 'night', 'perfect', 'Johnson', 'direction', 'mostlyinspired', 'performances', 'are', '..Thomas', 'being', 'theexception', '..perfect', 'Wright', 'particularly', 'fine', 'King', 'Truly', 'aniconic', 'piece', 'acting', 'one', 'too', 'rarely', 'days.This', 'film', 'miniseries', 'KING', 'are', 'definitive', 'onthe', 'life', 'Dr.', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'man', 'now', 'been', 'said', 'are', 'good.Highly', 'recommended']",Boycott
