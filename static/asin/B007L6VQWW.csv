1533418,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B007L6VQWW,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 4]","I was a really big fan of `Another Earth'.  I thought it was intriguing and captivating and had so much individuality.  It breathed its own air and felt fresh and exciting.  With that feeling looming over, and decided that `Sound of My Voice' was going to be a similar film and sunk my teeth in.  Conceptually, I really has a lot to offer, but I can't help but think that it didn't develop its themes and its premise in a way that wholly works.  It is satisfying up to a certain extent, but the ending (while lavishing in the same ambiguousness that made `Another Earth' so provoking) just doesn't drive home the film's point or narrative in a way that compels me to think much about this after the fact.It was a letdown of sorts; that ending.`Sound of My Voice' follows a couple, Peter and Lorna, who have fully immersed themselves in a secret cult in order to expose it as a hoax, as a con.  The leader of the cult, a young woman named Maggie, claims to be from the future (the year 2054) and claims that she has been sent to help save the people she loves.  Her claims are vague and her purpose is even more vague, something that I took issue with.  She kept speaking of a place they were leaving for but never explained in depth or even minor detail what or where that place was.  The story takes an interesting turn when it broaches on Peter's home life.  A substitute teacher, Maggie preys on this aspect of Peter and asks him to get a girl from his class for her.  This is where the film starts to pick up and some of Maggie's intentions are made clear...Or are they?That's what I don't get.  They flirt with letting you in and then completely pull you back.  I think I understand (it makes perfect sense in a way) and then again, I'm left somewhat unaffected by the outcome because it isn't fully developed.That said, the atmospheric tones are exceptional.  The use of sound is remarkable here, really pulling you in to every scene, and Brit Marling is a truly talented actress who manages to make Maggie feel compelling and truthful while constantly plucking at the fraying edges of her identity.  She always seems slightly off, like she's lying, but she's a really, really good liar.",4,Sounds can be deafening...,1365552000,"04 10, 2013",2013,2193,"['was', 'really', 'big', 'fan', 'Earth', 'thought', 'was', 'intriguing', 'captivating', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'individuality', 'breathed', 'own', 'air', 'felt', 'fresh', 'exciting', 'feeling', 'looming', 'decided', 'Sound', 'My', 'Voice', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'similar', 'film', 'sunk', 'teeth', 'Conceptually', 'really', 'lot', 'offer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'did', ""n't"", 'develop', 'themes', 'premise', 'way', 'wholly', 'satisfying', 'up', 'certain', 'extent', 'ending', 'lavishing', 'same', 'ambiguousness', 'made', 'Earth', 'so', 'provoking', 'just', ""n't"", 'drive', 'home', 'film', 'point', 'narrative', 'way', 'compels', 'think', 'much', 'fact.It', 'was', 'letdown', 'sorts', 'Sound', 'My', 'Voice', 'couple', 'Peter', 'Lorna', 'who', 'have', 'fully', 'immersed', 'secret', 'cult', 'order', 'expose', 'hoax', 'con', 'leader', 'cult', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Maggie', 'be', 'future', 'year', '2054', 'claims', 'been', 'sent', 'help', 'save', 'people', 'claims', 'are', 'vague', 'purpose', 'even', 'more', 'vague', 'something', 'took', 'issue', 'kept', 'speaking', 'place', 'were', 'leaving', 'never', 'explained', 'depth', 'even', 'minor', 'detail', 'what', 'where', 'place', 'was', 'story', 'interesting', 'turn', 'when', 'Peter', 'home', 'life', 'substitute', 'teacher', 'Maggie', 'preys', 'aspect', 'Peter', 'get', 'girl', 'class', 'where', 'film', 'pick', 'up', 'Maggie', 'intentions', 'are', 'made', 'clear', 'are', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'flirt', 'letting', 'then', 'completely', 'back', 'think', 'understand', 'perfect', 'sense', 'way', 'then', 'again', ""'m"", 'left', 'somewhat', 'unaffected', 'outcome', ""n't"", 'fully', 'developed.That', 'said', 'atmospheric', 'tones', 'are', 'exceptional', 'use', 'sound', 'remarkable', 'here', 'really', 'pulling', 'scene', 'Brit', 'Marling', 'truly', 'talented', 'actress', 'who', 'make', 'Maggie', 'feel', 'compelling', 'truthful', 'constantly', 'plucking', 'fraying', 'edges', 'identity', 'always', 'slightly', 'off', 'lying', 'really', 'really', 'good', 'liar']",Sound of My Voice

A stunning beauty, she plays an otherworldly cult leader here, Maggie, a woman who claims to hail from 2054 with scary but important news about the future. We meet her thanks to the endeavors of Peter (Christopher Denham) and Lorna (Nicole Vicius, an amazing beauty), who are out to strike it rich by making a documentary about Maggie and her cult. Peter, especially, has some skin in this game, because his mother died after joining a cult.But as time goes on, Maggie seems to be getting under Peter's skin. &#34;We wanted to make a documentary about a cult,&#34; Lorna complains to him. &#34;And now we're in one.&#34;  Things escalate when Maggie demands that Peter prove his loyalty by kidnapping one of his eight-year-old students.Scanning the reviews I got confirmation for something I'd suspected: the ending of this movie is the major flaw. It's just too darn abrupt, with no follow up. I'm almost positive it had to do with the budget. This film had a shoestring budget and yet still it looks and feels really good.

As much as Another Earth has the ability to put on the appearance of being a bigger than Indie movie, The Sound of My Voice is clearly in the Indie tradition, and perhaps the reality tradition, yet manages to convey a sense of the mystical as well.A documentary filmmaker Peter, and his girlfriend penetrate the mysterious, inner workings of a cult. The members shower, are blindfolded, and driven to a secret meeting place. He is a schoolteacher with dreams of being a director. The mysterious and charismatic cult leader Maggie played by Brit Marling, has returned from the future, to save a select group of people, her followers. She breathes through a tube in the nose, yet occasionally removes the tube and seems to breathe with no bother.How one can get a camera in without being seen, and film without being noticed is a rather interesting question.On the surface she seems genuine and legit, though, if you're like me you will wonder, if she is a deluded soul or something more sinister. She appears to have extraordinary empathic and intuitive powers, yet some of what she does raises questions. She punishes bad behavior, and rewards compliance. I found it rather engaging, as when one member is ejected for asking questions, yet she claims this is not the reason for his ejection.Yet other members clearly become more compliant when she reacts like this. These tactics appear to work on the Peter, when she makes a very strange request of him, and she alienates him from his girlfriend. Maggie remains a mysterious character even to the end, with some intriguing twists and I loved the end.If you are new to Brit Marling's movies, I recommend Another Earth more highly. It won two awards at the Sundance Film Festival.Like Another Earth this is quite thought provoking, there are a few parallels such as the search for meaning, and in this case the search for truth.Sometimes necessity is the mother of invention and Brit Marling who was struggling like other actresses to get roles decided to go a different route and write the screenplays for the characters she would play and work with the directors she knew.I really admire that type of entrepreneurial spirit and this type of accomplishment.Last week I saw her in the Richard Gere movie Arbitrage so her strategy appears to have paid off.I do hope she will continue to make these types of movies as it brings a wonderful diversity to our moviegoing experiences.I think you will enjoy it, and I hope this was helpful.",4,Welcome to the world of secret handshakes.,1348272000,"09 22, 2012",2012,2621,"['Having', 'seen', 'been', 'impressed', 'Brit', 'Marling', 'other', 'work', 'Earth', 'was', 'enthusiasm', 'ventured', 'forth', 'see', 'movie', 'As', 'much', 'Earth', 'ability', 'put', 'appearance', 'being', 'bigger', 'Indie', 'movie', 'Sound', 'My', 'Voice', 'clearly', 'Indie', 'tradition', 'perhaps', 'reality', 'tradition', 'yet', 'convey', 'sense', 'mystical', 'well.A', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', 'Peter', 'girlfriend', 'penetrate', 'mysterious', 'inner', 'workings', 'cult', 'members', 'shower', 'are', 'blindfolded', 'driven', 'secret', 'meeting', 'place', 'schoolteacher', 'dreams', 'being', 'director', 'mysterious', 'charismatic', 'cult', 'leader', 'Maggie', 'played', 'Brit', 'Marling', 'returned', 'future', 'save', 'select', 'group', 'people', 'followers', 'tube', 'nose', 'yet', 'occasionally', 'tube', 'breathe', 'bother.How', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'camera', 'being', 'seen', 'film', 'being', 'noticed', 'rather', 'interesting', 'question.On', 'surface', 'genuine', 'legit', 'though', ""'re"", 'will', 'wonder', 'deluded', 'soul', 'something', 'more', 'sinister', 'have', 'extraordinary', 'empathic', 'intuitive', 'powers', 'what', 'raises', 'questions', 'bad', 'behavior', 'rewards', 'compliance', 'found', 'rather', 'engaging', 'when', 'one', 'member', 'ejected', 'asking', 'questions', 'yet', 'not', 'reason', 'ejection.Yet', 'other', 'members', 'clearly', 'become', 'more', 'compliant', 'when', 'tactics', 'appear', 'work', 'Peter', 'when', 'very', 'strange', 'request', 'girlfriend', 'Maggie', 'mysterious', 'character', 'even', 'end', 'intriguing', 'twists', 'loved', 'end.If', 'are', 'new', 'Brit', 'Marling', 'movies', 'recommend', 'Earth', 'more', 'highly', 'won', 'two', 'awards', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival.Like', 'Earth', 'quite', 'thought', 'provoking', 'are', 'few', 'parallels', 'such', 'search', 'meaning', 'case', 'search', 'truth.Sometimes', 'necessity', 'mother', 'invention', 'Brit', 'Marling', 'who', 'was', 'struggling', 'other', 'actresses', 'get', 'roles', 'decided', 'go', 'different', 'route', 'write', 'screenplays', 'characters', 'would', 'play', 'work', 'directors', 'knew.I', 'really', 'admire', 'type', 'entrepreneurial', 'spirit', 'type', 'accomplishment.Last', 'week', 'saw', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'movie', 'Arbitrage', 'so', 'strategy', 'have', 'paid', 'off.I', 'do', 'hope', 'will', 'continue', 'make', 'types', 'movies', 'wonderful', 'diversity', 'moviegoing', 'experiences.I', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'hope', 'was', 'helpful']",Sound of My Voice

1533439,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B007L6VQWW,Paul Allaer,"[20, 22]","""Sound of My Voice"" (85 min.) brings the story of Peter (played by Christopher Denham) and his girlfriend Lorna, who in true ""investigative journalism"" mode are infiltrating a small cult of some sort, with a view of making a documentary to expose the cult. The cult is led by a young woman called Maggie (played by Brit Marling), who claims to be from ""54"", as in... 2054. (Please don't ask yoursel how Peter and Lorna found out about this new small cult or how they were able to infiltrate it, it is never explained in the movie.) The cult seems to be made up of about 10 people who are brought blind-folded to the basement of a non-descript house somewhere in Los Angeles.In his ""other"" life, Peter is a substitute teacher of an all-girl class of 8 year olds. At a key point in the movie Maggie asks Peter to bring one specific girl from his class to her. How did Maggie know of this girl? Will Peter give in to this request, which amounts to kidnapping? To say much more about the plot would be to ruin your viewing experience. I thought this movie, which clearly was made on a nickel and a dime, was done quite nicely. There is a certain amount of tension from the very beginning that doesn't let up at all until the end of the movie (when Hot Chip's Thieves of the Night plays over the end credits).Special kudos to Zal Batmanglij (director and co-writer) and of course also to Brit Marling, who also co-wrote the script for this movie. This movie is MILES away from your typical Hollywood main fare. I have no idea why it took over a year for this movie to be released in the theatre (it created quite a buzz when it premiered at the 2011 SXSW film festival), but better later than never I suppose.

1533449,A3KKOJ6T4DCBDT,B007L6VQWW,"technoguy ""jack""","[1, 1]","Information-deficit dogs the steps of ths indie film about a cult.To say it casts shadows over a very decent effort by writer-actress Laura Marling and writer-direrctor Zal Batmanglij,is to say any more clarity would have entailed greater cost and more thorough development.There is the question of cults and what are they,how we approach them,what makes them distinguishable from religions.What do we have to do to give our lives meaning?Cults have got a bad press(eg we have the example of Scientology setting itself up as a mainstream religion for the tax breaks). They are nebulous,they depend upon secrecy and charisma,codes, rituals (showering,handshakes)inexplicable phenomena like time-travel,or coming from the future.Are they masking something sinister?The acting is great,the menace and tension unbearable.Marling is stirring as the beautiful leader of a cult who has to live in this basement,claiming to be from the future.She has to grow her own food and can't venture out.She depends on the blood of her followers.The question of how the documentarian duo investigate a cult they are part of.Dialogue is brilliant in ten sharply written episodes. What is vague is that plot strands remain untied,the ending seems a cop out.Design is low key,simple.The form is crackling.The set upis intriguing,the atmosphere is increased by the unpredictable direction,uncertainty.What better way into this cult than having 2 documentary film makers, Peter (Christopher Denham) and Lorna(Nicole Vicius) entering to find out what they can,but masking this with the desire to join the cult.Maggie the cult leader makes an entrance trailing an oxygen tank,suggesting vulnerability,fear of infection,delicacy, high-borne purpose.The guru has come to initiate and test her would-be fellow-travellers.Softly spoken,giving hope,feeding off their mutual curiosity.She claims to be from the future(2054),with no proof save a symbol on her leg and a pop song she sings from the past.These leaders depend upon your faith,any questioning scepticism, withholding, is perceived as cowardice,makes them angry.The news she has come to tell them is the future of wars and famine,their need for preparation for it.Their selection for it.Peter thinks her exposure would prevent all these people killing themselves.He'll make tapes of cult gatherings.""To see her is to believe her,but that's how all these cons work"".His glasses have inbuilt video,he swallows a receiver.Our argument about this cult are influenced by Peter and Lorna's waverings,fluctuations,fallings-out,disagreements.Peter is against at first then he's for.Lorna accepts it at first but then aids and abets the DoJ in reporting it and trying to bring it down.Peter is asked to abduct a child to meet Maggie,he being a teacher of the child.Each person who sees the film receives it differently,sees something else with no one meaning.Tying up loose ends would do away with its multi-dimensional scope.We're dealing with group formation of like-minded people,one or two of whom enter sceptically(as our duo of detective journalists to make their documentary to expose the cult and blow its' cover) then find themselves in over their heads.To stay in the group requires `trust' and `faith' with reason in suspension.We tell ourselves this is a scam,what is this ,a reverse mother-daughter situation?How far are people tested to ensure their selection?In this film,ostensibly about going on a journey into the future, journey more important than arrival.What do we have to do to give our livesmeaning? If she is not from the future(likely) has she been indoctrinated as a charismatic leader of a survivalist cult?Is the DoJ lady not what she seems? Does she enlist Lorna's support to encourage Peter to bring Abigail to Maggie?Does Maggie after being seized by the Police get to meet Abigail outside?Are Abigail and Maggie sisters who suffered similar abuse and grooming,learning the handshake in common?Why are children abducted for this cult(we never find out)?Maggie remembers waking up submerged in a bath(after a drug experience/escaping grooming by a cult?) and is picked up by Klaus, returned,fed and revived.Abigail is being injected between her toes by her father who appears to be indoctrinating her using a labtop.She often goes to sleep in public and builds strange lego buildings.Peter's dislike of cults springs from his mother being in a cult and her dying when he was 13 from cancer. The future is a maguffin,Maggie's in hiding for felony and arson.The idea she's from the future is lame as there is not enough backing for this idea in terms of evidence, production costs.Has she been groomed(like Abigail,her sister,daughter,mother???) to lead this new militia movement in the coming civil war?Lorna has been shown how to shoot a gun in the woods by one of the cult members.What the film required was a rewrite by David Mamet the master of the art of scam and con scenarios.The snap of action would have adrenalised it.As it is a series of individually brilliant scenes,loose beads without a connecting thread. Well worth seeing but it could have been so much better with not much more effort.Batmangklij has made a superb debut.Marling has created a complex female character, but she needs to get it housed in

1533453,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B007L6VQWW,Turfseer,"[3, 6]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Brit Marling, star and co-writer of 'Sound of MY Voice' was also responsible for 'Another Earth', a 2012 Spirit Award nominee for Best First Feature. Both films are similar in that they have an ambiguous ending which has sparked vast debate on the internet message boards. The ending of 'Sound of my Voice' is even more integral to the plot than 'Another Earth', since viewers are led to expect a big 'payoff'.That payoff involves whether the film's antagonist, Maggie, a cult leader, who claims to be from the year 2054, actually is a time traveler from the future. Before dissecting the ending, it's important to realize that the film is also about the power of cult psychology. The film's protagonist, Peter, along with his girlfriend, Lorna, are documentary filmmakers who decide to risk all by infiltrating the group. I had a hard time with the idea that Peter, knowing how dangerous the cult is, still is intent on going ahead with his project. You have to suspend your disbelief over Peter's stubbornness, since the average person (working in a vacuum as Peter and Lorna do) would probably not take such a risk.The film's main conceit during the 'Second Act' of the narrative is that even the most steadfast skeptics such as Peter, can be seduced by a talented manipulator. He and Lorna are subjected to a series of 'loyalty tests' including eating worms and poisoned apples, culminating in Maggie's ability to break Peter down emotionally during one of the sessions (she alludes to one of Peter's upsetting childhood memories). While Peter tells Lorna it was all just an act, later Peter agrees to assist in the abduction of Abigail, the young girl Maggie claims is her mother. Peter argues that he just wants to finish the job he started since so many people never do that. The scenarists of 'Sound of My Voice' argue whatever Peter's ultimate motive is, in the end he's been manipulated into committing an egregious act (the abduction of a child).While hardly any of the mechanics of cult indoctrination can be termed 'suspenseful', Ms. Marling and her co-writer keep dropping hints that there's something a lot bigger afoot. The big 'twist' at the end has Abigail giving Maggie the secret handshake, leading to all kinds of speculation. Interpretations of the ending have been broken down into multiple camps.One camp basically holds that Maggie is indeed Abigail's daughter and a time traveler. Adherents of this point of view point to the fact that when Abigail asks Maggie how she knew the secret handshake, Maggie replies, ""you taught it to me."" In this scenario, Abigail has been trained to be a terrorist and later Maggie receives the same indoctrination. Maggie's aim is to save her 'mother' as well as herself from those people in the future who have abused them. Carol, the self-declared 'Department of Justice' investigator, is actually a bounty hunter from the future, who is assigned to thwart Maggie's plans, as she will prevent both Abigail and Maggie from turning away from the cult in the present and the future. Camp #1 points to the fact that if these were real Department of Justice investigators, Peter would have also had to have been detained on charges of complicity in the kidnapping.Another camp holds that Carol is a cult follower who pretends to be a Department of Justice Investigator. The cult cons Lorna into believing that Maggie has been arrested but in reality she has been simply 'taken away' by cult followers. With this belief, Lorna is no longer a threat. The 'secret handshake' has been arranged by the man who has been indoctrinating Abigail and Maggie is in on it. Peter, the skeptic, suddenly becomes a 'true believer' in the cult, as he's been conned into the whole time travel scenario.And another camp holds time travel is impossible and it's Klaus who's the true Svengali here. He found the drug-addicted Maggie on the street and brainwashed her into believing that Abigail is her mother. Nonetheless, Abigail may indeed be Maggie's daughter and old lost memories may be breaking into her consciousness. Something inside her is telling her to save Abigail and when Peter finally brings Abigail to her and asks how she knew the secret handshake, Maggie suddenly recalls her daughter taught it to her when she was much smaller (the man who appears to be her 'father' is a cult follower who has been brainwashing little Abigail since her earliest memories, and taught her the secret handshake). Carol is actually affiliated with the DOJ and interrupts the confused Maggie and arrests her, as she is aware that she has a criminal history. Nonetheless, Maggie may not be held criminally liable as later on it may come out that she has been manipulated by Klaus.There seem to be a myriad of explanations to explain the ending of this film. Some people believe that such ambiguity is a mark of a great film--the fact that so many people can come up with so many different explanations as to what this film is about, is held up by some, as a sign of great creativity. On the other hand, others (including myself), feel that this kind of writing is a cop-out. Do you really have a definitive point of view you're trying to put across? Or are you leaving things intentionally ambiguous because you really haven't thought through precisely what you're trying to say?I suppose a film such as this which engenders so much discussion on the internet deserves an extra star. But ultimately, the film never answers fundamental questions about its antagonist which should be answered, leading one to conclude that the film's scenarists do not have a firm grasp on their material.",2,Ambiguous ending fails to satisfactorily answer ultimate question about cult leader,1359763200,"02 2, 2013",2013,5658,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Brit',
