It is totally unlike Christina Applegate's other roles. Imagine her Married With Children character as a whore. It is a total drama/action, as a kid who has run away rescues her from a killer. Unfortunately, the killer is a cop and chases them down as she shows the kid around the shady underworld of the streets and does her business in the ""world's oldest profession."" The killer cop stuff all but ruins a decent film.Angel in Red was basically about a band of prostitutes trying to keep one of their kids away from their pimp.

1512869,AGTFW4TAC7W2H,B0067QZCXQ,"M. McClellan ""marksakissfan""","[6, 7]","Imagine my surprise as I'm scoping out Amazon when I come across two lost movies I was beginning to think would never hit DVD: STREETS, which is among my top 10 favorite movies, and ANGEL IN RED, another good picture. Both feature ingenues who were big on TV: Christina Applegate from Married with Children and Leslie Bega from Head of the Class. These films, made in the early Nineties, have taken 20 years to make it to disk. Frankly, I don't understand what took so long. Granted, neither is well known but there have been opportunities to cash in on these titles before.Christina Applegate has maintained a relatively high profile over the years thanks to shows like Samantha Who? and Up All Night as well as her battle with breast cancer. And at 40 she has aged extremely well and is still a major hottie. STREETS was made at the height of her popularity and contains one of her only love scenes to date. In STREETS she plays Dawn, a teenage prostitute who's befriends a young runaway named Sy. Under a LA pier Dawn's ""business"" with a mysterious stranger (whom we later learn is a cop named Lumley) goes horribly wrong when things turns violent. After escaping him Dawn and Sy wander the streets and we meet an assortment of disturbed and homeless people. Later on, Lumley catches up to Dawn who, along with Sy, have to fight for their lives. A bit of trivia; EG Daily who sings ""Dawn's Theme"" also appeared as Candy in THE DEVIL'S REJECTS playing -believe it or not- a prostitute.When Leslie Bega appeared on The Sopranos and posed for Maxim magazine you'd think ANGEL IN RED would've seen the light of day. More surprising since Bega has no less than THREE topless scenes in this flick. She plays Micki, a young prostitute who is also caring for her abused and mentally disabled brother. When her pimp Sharkey (played by a very young Jeffrey Dean Morgan-holy cow!) goes mad and kills her best friend Joey (who is also one of Sharkey's girls) she enlists the aid of a rival pimp Stash to deal with him. Sharkey kills Stash's henchmen and hunts down Micki killing everybody in his path. A dramatic ending hammers it home. This movie contains a few deleted scenes not in earlier versions that mostly contain nudity. It also retains it's original title as it was renamed UNCAGED for the VHS release. Both movies are well acted and very engaging.Both films were reviewed by me. You can read them on Amazon.For this release, it's gratifying to know that both movies are presented in anamorphic widescreen. Although the presentation is somewhat grainy they're both a major step up from videotape. Many multipack DVD combos still present their low budget movies in fullscreen only. Why I'll never know.A seperate and eventual Blu-ray release for each movie -along with commentaries- would be preferable, but for now this'll do just fine.",5,Two Low Budget Gems Finally on DVD,1340841600,"06 28, 2012",2012,2837,"['Imagine', 'surprise', ""'m"", 'scoping', 'out', 'Amazon', 'when', 'come', 'two', 'lost', 'movies', 'was', 'beginning', 'think', 'would', 'never', 'hit', 'DVD', 'STREETS', 'top', '10', 'favorite', 'movies', 'ANGEL', 'IN', 'RED', 'good', 'picture', 'feature', 'ingenues', 'who', 'were', 'big', 'TV', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'Married', 'Children', 'Leslie', 'Bega', 'Head', 'Class', 'films', 'made', 'early', 'Nineties', 'have', 'taken', '20', 'years', 'make', 'disk', 'Frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'Granted', 'well', 'known', 'have', 'been', 'opportunities', 'cash', 'titles', 'before.Christina', 'Applegate', 'maintained', 'relatively', 'high', 'profile', 'years', 'thanks', 'shows', 'Samantha', 'Who', 'All', 'Night', 'as', 'well', 'battle', 'breast', 'cancer', '40', 'aged', 'extremely', 'well', 'still', 'major', 'hottie', 'STREETS', 'was', 'made', 'height', 'popularity', 'one', 'only', 'love', 'scenes', 'date', 'STREETS', 'Dawn', 'teenage', 'prostitute', 'who', 'young', 'runaway', 'named', 'Sy', 'LA', 'pier', 'Dawn', 'business', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'whom', 'later', 'cop', 'named', 'Lumley', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'when', 'things', 'violent', 'escaping', 'Dawn', 'Sy', 'wander', 'streets', 'meet', 'assortment', 'disturbed', 'homeless', 'people', 'Later', 'Lumley', 'up', 'Dawn', 'who', 'Sy', 'have', 'fight', 'lives', 'bit', 'trivia', 'EG', 'Daily', 'who', 'Dawn', 'Theme', 'also', 'appeared', 'Candy', 'THE', 'DEVIL', 'REJECTS', 'playing', '-believe', 'not-', 'prostitute.When', 'Leslie', 'Bega', 'appeared', 'Sopranos', 'posed', 'Maxim', 'magazine', ""'d"", 'think', 'ANGEL', 'IN', 'RED', 'would', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'light', 'day', 'More', 'surprising', 'Bega', 'less', 'THREE', 'topless', 'scenes', 'flick', 'Micki', 'young', 'prostitute', 'who', 'also', 'caring', 'abused', 'mentally', 'disabled', 'brother', 'When', 'pimp', 'Sharkey', 'played', 'very', 'young', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan-holy', 'cow', 'mad', 'best', 'friend', 'Joey', 'who', 'also', 'one', 'Sharkey', 'girls', 'aid', 'rival', 'pimp', 'Stash', 'deal', 'Sharkey', 'Stash', 'henchmen', 'hunts', 'down', 'Micki', 'killing', 'everybody', 'path', 'dramatic', 'ending', 'hammers', 'home', 'movie', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'not', 'earlier', 'versions', 'mostly', 'contain', 'nudity', 'also', 'original', 'title', 'was', 'renamed', 'UNCAGED', 'VHS', 'release', 'movies', 'are', 'well', 'acted', 'very', 'engaging.Both', 'films', 'were', 'reviewed', 'can', 'read', 'Amazon.For', 'release', 'gratifying', 'know', 'movies', 'are', 'presented', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'somewhat', 'grainy', ""'re"", 'major', 'step', 'up', 'videotape', 'Many', 'multipack', 'DVD', 'combos', 'still', 'present', 'low', 'budget', 'movies', 'fullscreen', 'only', 'Why', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know.A', 'seperate', 'eventual', 'Blu-ray', 'release', 'movie', 'commentaries-', 'would', 'be', 'preferable', 'now', ""'ll"", 'do', 'just', 'fine']",Streets/Angel in Red
1512870,A39GW5CBWTIWAZ,B0067QZCXQ,Phil S.,"[1, 2]","A couple of low budget, Friday-night-movies kind of item, which lend to glancing while one prepares a microwave dinner, actually have a very strong pull, with good scripts an exceptionally good acting.""Streets"" is the better film, as Christina Applegate once again shows she is easily among the very best of the new generation (1989) - her range is astonishing for her age. She plays the kid from the ""streets"", caught in-between: too smart for what she's doing but too unfocused and disoriented to take her [street] smarts to a college entrance exam and a modeling agency. She hooks up with a ""fringe"" streeter, a nice guy (Sy) from the suburbs, who hangs out with trouble...when things get wierd, he's back at the train station. In all the youthful confusion, real Love finds them...and separates them. While they navigate the city they must deal with an out of control Lawman, whose hobby is terrorizing young women in the early morning, beneath the piers.""Angel In Red"" from a years after, is more 'arty"", appearing to be filmed on used celluloid, a careful blend of shadow and high contrast colour. The lead is Leslie Bega, as Mickie, who arrives in town with her brain damaged but protective Brother. The nemesis is the Pimp Stash, played intensely by Jeffrey Dean Morgan. I kept waiting for Mickie to be revealed as a naive College kid who thinks she can penetrate this benighted existence and write her thesis (while rescuing her new found friends). Not bad, huh?Not sure that for 27 bucks we have something 50-inch worthy but if the DVD gos out of irculation...then, yes. Also, if you love Married With Children. (Had to say it, Christina).",4,Streets **** / Angel In Red ***,1326585600,"01 15, 2012",2012,1649,"['couple', 'low', 'budget', 'Friday-night-movies', 'kind', 'item', 'lend', 'glancing', 'one', 'microwave', 'dinner', 'actually', 'have', 'very', 'strong', 'pull', 'good', 'scripts', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'acting', 'Streets', 'better', 'film', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'once', 'again', 'easily', 'very', 'best', 'new', 'generation', '1989', 'range', 'astonishing', 'age', 'kid', 'streets', 'caught', 'in-between', 'too', 'smart', 'what', 'doing', 'too', 'unfocused', 'disoriented', 'take', '[', 'street', ']', 'college', 'entrance', 'exam', 'modeling', 'agency', 'up', 'fringe', 'streeter', 'nice', 'guy', 'Sy', 'suburbs', 'who', 'out', 'trouble', 'when', 'things', 'get', 'wierd', 'back', 'train', 'station', 'youthful', 'confusion', 'real', 'Love', 'navigate', 'city', 'must', 'deal', 'control', 'Lawman', 'hobby', 'terrorizing', 'young', 'women', 'early', 'morning', 'piers', 'Angel', 'Red', 'years', 'more', ""'arty"", 'appearing', 'be', 'filmed', 'used', 'celluloid', 'careful', 'blend', 'shadow', 'high', 'contrast', 'colour', 'lead', 'Leslie', 'Bega', 'Mickie', 'who', 'town', 'brain', 'damaged', 'protective', 'Brother', 'nemesis', 'Pimp', 'Stash', 'played', 'intensely', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'kept', 'waiting', 'Mickie', 'be', 'revealed', 'naive', 'College', 'kid', 'who', 'can', 'penetrate', 'benighted', 'existence', 'write', 'thesis', 'rescuing', 'new', 'found', 'friends', 'Not', 'bad', 'huh', 'Not', 'sure', '27', 'bucks', 'have', 'something', '50-inch', 'worthy', 'DVD', 'gos', 'irculation', 'then', 'yes', 'Also', 'love', 'Married', 'Children', 'Had', 'say', 'Christina']",Streets/Angel in Red
