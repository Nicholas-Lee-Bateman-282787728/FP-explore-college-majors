Jake Kincaid, Jack of...","[0, 0]","Upon viewing, this film seems to have two strikes against it, and Sandy Koufax just took the mound to close.To say the acting is amateurish in almost every case would be being kind; the camera work, whilst there are some really outstanding shots and good composition, is shaky and inconsistent; even the quality of the film is grainy and pixelated, tiling VERY apparent on the blacks and a lot of distortion in long shots; the sound work is hit and miss, a good bit of the dialogue fading into the background behind the overly-amped and D-grade soundtrack; the story is a pretty good one, not entirely original, but done in a convincing and different way, but there are several elements that don't immediately make an overt amount of sense......and all of that sounds like a terrible excuse for killing an hour of your time watching it.However...When you sit back and take into account that this film was done by a group of basically kids, with probably about two-hundred bucks worth of budget, borrowed equipment, and a weekend or two to work on it, you have to see it with different eyes.  I doubt seriously anyone who worked on this film got paid a red cent up front; it was composed purely of passion and dogged determination to get something worthwhile put together in a genre they obviously all love.  They sought to bring out a little originality rather than re-hash something someone else had already done, and whereas you can see some elements in the film you've seen before, overall I think they were successful.The story is simplistic, but sometimes those are the best kind:  A small town in New York (the actual hometown of the filmmakers) has an extremely unusual amount of teen disappearances, and local law seems stymied (well, actually, disinterested, but that's a plot point).  In this same little town is a guy named Loomis who runs an annual ""haunted house"" in his garage every Halloween (again, an actual event in this town), and the local teens think he may be the culprit in the disappearances...indeed, even using the bodies of his victims as props.  Impromptu investigations begin, and the fun starts.For this to be a no-budget film, the special effects are pretty good (and somewhat over the top, but they were obviously aiming for that), and if you watch it all with an open mind and appreciation for the genre, it genuinely grows on you before the second reel starts.  I'm a fan of indie horror, and can appreciate even the most pedestrian attempts if the heart is in it, and I believe that's the case with this one.So...casual watchers of the horror flick, you may want to go back, re-read my opening paragraph, and walk on...but you dyed-in-the-wool horrorphiles, if you keep your mind open, will find an enjoyable watch outta this one...don't spend a lot on it, but it's definitely worth seeing.I give it a solid three stars for the effort, the story, and the pretty good eye for cinematography.Hat's off to the young Andy Wolf and the family and friends that obviously put so much into this!",3,Putting things in perspective...,1289433600,"11 11, 2010",2010,3022,"['viewing', 'film', 'have', 'two', 'strikes', 'Sandy', 'Koufax', 'just', 'took', 'mound', 'close.To', 'say', 'acting', 'amateurish', 'almost', 'case', 'would', 'be', 'being', 'kind', 'camera', 'work', 'are', 'really', 'outstanding', 'shots', 'good', 'composition', 'shaky', 'inconsistent', 'even', 'quality', 'film', 'grainy', 'pixelated', 'tiling', 'VERY', 'apparent', 'blacks', 'lot', 'distortion', 'long', 'shots', 'sound', 'work', 'hit', 'miss', 'good', 'bit', 'dialogue', 'fading', 'background', 'overly-amped', 'D-grade', 'soundtrack', 'story', 'pretty', 'good', 'one', 'not', 'entirely', 'original', 'done', 'convincing', 'different', 'way', 'are', 'several', 'elements', 'do', ""n't"", 'immediately', 'make', 'overt', 'amount', 'sense', 'terrible', 'excuse', 'killing', 'hour', 'time', 'watching', 'it.However', 'When', 'sit', 'back', 'take', 'account', 'film', 'was', 'done', 'group', 'basically', 'kids', 'probably', 'two-hundred', 'bucks', 'budget', 'borrowed', 'equipment', 'weekend', 'two', 'work', 'have', 'see', 'different', 'eyes', 'doubt', 'seriously', 'anyone', 'who', 'worked', 'film', 'got', 'paid', 'red', 'cent', 'up', 'front', 'was', 'composed', 'purely', 'passion', 'dogged', 'determination', 'get', 'something', 'worthwhile', 'put', 'together', 'genre', 'obviously', 'love', 'sought', 'bring', 'out', 'little', 'originality', 'rather', 're-hash', 'something', 'someone', 'else', 'had', 'already', 'done', 'can', 'see', 'elements', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'overall', 'think', 'were', 'successful.The', 'story', 'simplistic', 'sometimes', 'are', 'best', 'kind', 'small', 'town', 'New', 'York', 'actual', 'hometown', 'filmmakers', 'extremely', 'unusual', 'amount', 'teen', 'disappearances', 'local', 'law', 'stymied', 'well', 'actually', 'disinterested', 'plot', 'point', 'same', 'little', 'town', 'guy', 'named', 'Loomis', 'who', 'annual', 'haunted', 'house', 'garage', 'Halloween', 'again', 'actual', 'event', 'town', 'local', 'teens', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'culprit', 'disappearances', 'indeed', 'even', 'using', 'bodies', 'victims', 'props', 'Impromptu', 'investigations', 'begin', 'fun', 'starts.For', 'be', 'no-budget', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'somewhat', 'top', 'were', 'obviously', 'aiming', 'watch', 'open', 'mind', 'appreciation', 'genre', 'genuinely', 'second', 'reel', 'starts', ""'m"", 'fan', 'indie', 'horror', 'can', 'appreciate', 'even', 'most', 'pedestrian', 'attempts', 'heart', 'believe', 'case', 'one.So', 'casual', 'watchers', 'horror', 'flick', 'may', 'want', 'go', 'back', 're-read', 'opening', 'paragraph', 'walk', 'dyed-in-the-wool', 'horrorphiles', 'keep', 'mind', 'open', 'will', 'find', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'outta', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'spend', 'lot', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing.I', 'give', 'solid', 'three', 'stars', 'effort', 'story', 'pretty', 'good', 'eye', 'cinematography.Hat', 'young', 'Andy', 'Wolf', 'family', 'friends', 'obviously', 'put', 'so', 'much']",Mr. Halloween

Mr. Halloween is probably the only independent horror film i've watched that is nearly two hours long. The story is pretty good and had lots of promise. Then again as i've said before no movie has a good synposis followed by overall, you'll be disappointed with this movie. Mr. Halloween suffers from poor acting and it moves at a very slow pace; it could have been cut down to the standard hour thirty, forty minutes. There is a few good kills and inside the haunted house was good. The ending confused me and I guess I must have missed a cruical part of the film because I was lost.

1075904,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,B000QGDIH0,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[1, 2]","I guess everyone is out there making movies now.  All you need is a video camera and a few non-talented idiot 20 something people and you can have a horror movie?  Is this what my beloved horror genre has become?  Terrible movies like ""Mr. Halloween"" would suggest that it is what it is.Well, what we have here in ""Mr. Halloween"" is what appears to be, anyway, a group of kids who decided to make a movie and they liked the concept of the movie ""Halloween"" and the success that this particular low-budget movie had...just goes to show you that just because you make a low budget movie and have the word ""Halloween"" in it does NOT mean that you will produce a good horror movie.  So, in a lame attempt to cash in on Carpenter's masterpiece, these lamos splattered some blood around with cups, buckets and smeared it when a kill was supposed to take place, used their lame actors to run around like a bunch of freaks, and had a psychopath on this loose killing people, and they couldn't call it ""Halloween"", so they just put a ""Mr."" in front of ""Halloween"" and called it ""Mr. Halloween"".  The best part about this movie is the police officer's attitude toward this new generation of kids.  As cynical as he may be, he's got a point, and I don't blame him about these characters...it would have been great if everyone in this whole movie died...that's how bad it is.  Yeah, that's right, I don't like this movie and you know why?  Because, it's garbage!""Mr. Halloween"" completely lacks in atmosphere, suspense and mood, elements that are essential to any horror movie's success.  The makers of this garbage completely failed to capture a Halloween theme in this movie.  Just a complete mess here, and it's just further evidence to support the fact that the horror genre is officially dead.",1,"0 STARS:  Terrible acting, awful script, pathetic movie...it sucks.",1322697600,"12 1, 2011",2011,1786,"['guess', 'everyone', 'out', 'there', 'making', 'movies', 'now', 'need', 'video', 'camera', 'few', 'non-talented', 'idiot', '20', 'something', 'people', 'can', 'have', 'horror', 'movie', 'what', 'beloved', 'horror', 'genre', 'become', 'Terrible', 'movies', 'Mr.', 'Halloween', 'would', 'suggest', 'what', 'is.Well', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'Mr.', 'Halloween', 'what', 'be', 'anyway', 'group', 'kids', 'who', 'decided', 'make', 'movie', 'liked', 'concept', 'movie', 'Halloween', 'success', 'particular', 'low-budget', 'movie', 'had', 'just', 'show', 'just', 'make', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'have', 'word', 'Halloween', 'NOT', 'mean', 'will', 'produce', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'So', 'lame', 'attempt', 'cash', 'Carpenter', 'masterpiece', 'lamos', 'splattered', 'blood', 'cups', 'buckets', 'smeared', 'when', 'kill', 'was', 'supposed', 'take', 'place', 'used', 'lame', 'actors', 'run', 'around', 'bunch', 'freaks', 'had', 'psychopath', 'loose', 'killing', 'people', 'could', ""n't"", 'call', 'Halloween', 'just', 'put', 'Mr.', 'front', 'Halloween', 'called', 'Mr.', 'Halloween', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'police', 'officer', 'attitude', 'new', 'generation', 'kids', 'As', 'cynical', 'may', 'be', 'got', 'point', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'everyone', 'whole', 'movie', 'died', 'how', 'bad', 'Yeah', 'right', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'know', 'why', 'garbage', 'Mr', 'Halloween', 'completely', 'atmosphere', 'suspense', 'mood', 'elements', 'are', 'essential', 'horror', 'movie', 'success', 'makers', 'garbage', 'completely', 'failed', 'capture', 'Halloween', 'theme', 'movie', 'Just', 'complete', 'mess', 'here', 'just', 'further', 'evidence', 'support', 'fact', 'horror', 'genre', 'officially', 'dead']",Mr. Halloween

It has bland terrible dialog, they overdo the fake blood splatter, and the actors have no emotion in their voice. A man named Bill Loomis (who plays himself) is called Mr. Halloween because he runs a cheesy haunted house in this garage. He kidnaps teenagers and uses their body parts as props. Jill, played by Shannon Eastman, is probably the only worthy character, and that's not saying a lot. It is very stupid, but somewhat entertaining.

He showed people around his house then said to them to get out while they still can. The killer had a crazy look an his face all the time.
