Though, I am probably one of the few who favors season one the best. I saw random airings of Charles in charge and was most familiar with the cast from season 2 thru. But, the sometimes on again ""other family"" (I remember saying to myself, ""Who are they!"") that was on the show were my favorite, indeed. The whole cast seemed to really meld together. The writing was less cocky and used all the characters very accurately to their role. Charles was close to the Pembroke family, something you don't really get to see with the Powell's.",4,Who's the Boss: CHARLES edition,1286323200,"10 6, 2010",2010,622,"['Wow', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'Charles', 'Charge', 'show', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'Tops', 'man', 'am', 'probably', 'one', 'few', 'who', 'season', 'one', 'best', 'saw', 'random', 'airings', 'Charles', 'charge', 'was', 'most', 'familiar', 'cast', 'season', '2', 'thru', 'sometimes', 'again', 'other', 'family', 'remember', 'saying', 'myself', 'Who', 'are', 'was', 'show', 'were', 'favorite', 'indeed', 'whole', 'cast', 'seemed', 'really', 'meld', 'together', 'writing', 'was', 'less', 'cocky', 'used', 'characters', 'very', 'accurately', 'role', 'Charles', 'was', 'close', 'Pembroke', 'family', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'see', 'Powell']",N/A

1167487,A1KVF4MKAGF67P,B001AQT0R2,Diane L. Mechlinski,"[1, 1]","I have purchased and viewed the entire ""Charles in Charge"" TV series on DVD. It's a wonderful nostalgic to TV times when comedies were more pure and funny and sweet. Yet there were some lessons learned along the way, too. The only negative point I would mention about this series is that toward the end of it, no mention was made of the mother character - where she was, why she was always gone from the house. Season 4, I believe, had less of her appearance as well but at least she was there occasionally, shown as having taken a fulltime job selling real estate. I guess we're to assume she did that too in Season 5, however, if it weren't for ""Aunt Lillian"" (Charles' mom) and the grandfather, the kids under 'Charles' charge would not have had an adult family member present at all, which is kind of odd. This is why I rated this season 4 stars rather than 5.Otherwise, I liked the stories, the acting, and the characters. As I stated, sometimes it's so nice to go back to these old comedies when comedy was more wholesome and fun. It's a good break from today's all-too-many realistic and suggestive plots.",4,A Great TV Series,1299974400,"03 13, 2011",2011,1112,"['have', 'purchased', 'viewed', 'entire', 'Charles', 'Charge', 'TV', 'series', 'DVD', 'wonderful', 'nostalgic', 'TV', 'times', 'when', 'comedies', 'were', 'more', 'pure', 'funny', 'sweet', 'were', 'lessons', 'learned', 'way', 'too', 'only', 'negative', 'point', 'would', 'mention', 'series', 'end', 'mention', 'was', 'made', 'mother', 'character', 'where', 'was', 'why', 'was', 'always', 'gone', 'house', 'Season', '4', 'believe', 'had', 'less', 'appearance', 'well', 'least', 'was', 'there', 'occasionally', 'shown', 'having', 'taken', 'fulltime', 'job', 'selling', 'real', 'estate', 'guess', ""'re"", 'assume', 'did', 'too', 'Season', '5', 'however', 'were', ""n't"", 'Aunt', 'Lillian', 'Charles', 'mom', 'grandfather', 'kids', ""'Charles"", 'charge', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'adult', 'family', 'member', 'present', 'kind', 'odd', 'why', 'rated', 'season', '4', 'stars', 'rather', '5.Otherwise', 'liked', 'stories', 'acting', 'characters', 'stated', 'so', 'nice', 'go', 'back', 'old', 'comedies', 'when', 'comedy', 'was', 'more', 'wholesome', 'fun', 'good', 'break', 'today', 'all-too-many', 'realistic', 'suggestive', 'plots']",N/A

This is the last season where Charles takes care of the not so little children but teenagers of the Powel family, the last time he gets into trouble in college, with his bevy of girls, and the last time that his beloved and supposedly dumb best friend Buddy and Charles enjoy their adventures in the world of Charles in Charge.A word about Buddy, while his character starts out being a wide out and not so smart college kid, he also evolves into a total moron at some points in the other seasons, avid Buddy fans will be happy to know that in the last season Buddy not only shows great maturity, but proves over and over again that sometimes the fool is really that as big of a fool as one might think!
