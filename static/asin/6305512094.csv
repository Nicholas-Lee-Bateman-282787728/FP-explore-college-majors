This forty year old film was and still is a weak musical Disney vehicle. You could see that there were Disney touches in this production. However, in this film, touches would help only slightly...like a bandade does not help a gaping bleeding woundThis musical with songs and score from Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman, the studio's resident songwriting team seems forced into this film. This motion picture could have worked better without being a musical. One of the problems is the film fall flat with the off key and out of tune singing of Fred MacMurray and Greer Garson. British import Tommy Steele as the wise-alec butler John showcases his British song and dance reputation. the two vocal duets of Leslie Anne Warren (who was hand picked for this role by Disney himself ) and John Davidson is sweet, but too few.One would assume this movie would be in genre of Mary Poppins, Disney's other live action musical hit...but it misses in many ways including its casting. Fred MacMurray may have been a great actor for the studio, but he is the weak link as the Biddle father figure. The characters of the Biddle boys (Paul Peterson & Eddie Hodges) vanish after one sceneIn hinesight, this stylized musical seems like a dinosaur in the Disney Backlist compare to other films.  Norman Tokar's direction, which is usually fast paced,  focus on odd long shots, focusing on MacMurray's close ups  and Tommy Steele's smiling mug, rather than moving this film to any pacing.As classic family entertainment, It is okay. but rather long timewise and tonewise. For those parents who want to share this film with their kids, note this DVD is the Roadshow edition which has an intermission. so I suggest ,you can show this film to the kids in two partsWith all the talent involved, I rate it three stars for all that is jammed into this movie.Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD",3,The Last of an Era,1195084800,"11 15, 2007",2007,2027,"['been', 'told', 'film', 'was', 'last', 'live', 'action', 'Disney', 'film', 'supervised', 'Walt', 'last', 'animated', 'film', 'Walt', 'had', 'stamp', 'was', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'forty', 'year', 'old', 'film', 'was', 'still', 'weak', 'musical', 'Disney', 'vehicle', 'could', 'see', 'were', 'Disney', 'touches', 'production', 'However', 'film', 'touches', 'would', 'help', 'only', 'slightly', 'bandade', 'not', 'help', 'gaping', 'bleeding', 'woundThis', 'musical', 'songs', 'score', 'Richard', 'M.', 'Robert', 'B.', 'Sherman', 'studio', 'resident', 'songwriting', 'team', 'forced', 'film', 'motion', 'picture', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'being', 'musical', 'One', 'problems', 'film', 'fall', 'flat', 'off', 'key', 'tune', 'singing', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'Greer', 'Garson', 'British', 'import', 'Tommy', 'Steele', 'wise-alec', 'butler', 'John', 'British', 'song', 'dance', 'reputation', 'two', 'vocal', 'duets', 'Leslie', 'Anne', 'Warren', 'who', 'was', 'hand', 'picked', 'role', 'Disney', 'John', 'Davidson', 'sweet', 'too', 'few.One', 'would', 'assume', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'genre', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'Disney', 'other', 'live', 'action', 'musical', 'hit', 'many', 'ways', 'including', 'casting', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'actor', 'studio', 'weak', 'link', 'Biddle', 'father', 'figure', 'characters', 'Biddle', 'boys', 'Paul', 'Peterson', 'Eddie', 'Hodges', 'vanish', 'one', 'sceneIn', 'hinesight', 'stylized', 'musical', 'dinosaur', 'Disney', 'Backlist', 'compare', 'other', 'films', 'Norman', 'Tokar', 'direction', 'usually', 'fast', 'paced', 'focus', 'odd', 'long', 'shots', 'focusing', 'MacMurray', 'close', 'ups', 'Tommy', 'Steele', 'smiling', 'mug', 'rather', 'moving', 'film', 'pacing.As', 'classic', 'family', 'entertainment', 'okay', 'rather', 'long', 'timewise', 'tonewise', 'parents', 'who', 'want', 'share', 'film', 'kids', 'note', 'DVD', 'Roadshow', 'edition', 'intermission', 'so', 'suggest', 'can', 'show', 'film', 'kids', 'two', 'partsWith', 'talent', 'involved', 'rate', 'three', 'stars', 'jammed', 'movie.Bennet', 'Pomerantz', 'AUDIOWORLD']",N/A

My opinion of a movie is based on did I enjoy it for what it is, every movie made is not a classic but can be entertaining, thought provoking or hit that emotional nerve that makes you feel something be it good or bad.  I purchased this movie based on the reviews, which still are overwhelmingly favorable.  I watched it with my wife and grandmother and we each had the same opinion, this isn't very good, in fact it is bad, to our taste.  I like musicals but the songs, to me, were not catchy and the singers not very good or believable and the characters not really even likable.  In Poppins, The Sound of Music, Lady and The Tramp, Jungle Book, Song of the South, I could go on and on, there is the ability of the viewer to suspend disbelief, meaning of course that you are willing to go along for the ride of the story.

Watching this film for the first time in decades (having forgotten it even existed), I was struck by the fact that everyone involved was working as hard as they could but the results just weren't growing roses.  Having competent singers might have helped.  Having songs worth singing would have also helped immensely.  Tightening the story to keep it from straying from the point would have also helped matters greatly.  This was, after all, supposedly a biography of a real person (Biddle, played by Fred MacMurray) yet more time was lavished on the budding romance of his daughter (Lesley Ann Warren) and her newly acquired boyfriend (John Davidson).  It might have helped promote their careers but it did nothing to keep the story in check.  When the focus is kept on MacMurray and Greer Garson, the film is packed with fun (and gators).  When it veers off into the more mundane matters of other characters, it falls flat.  They managed to give his two sons (Paul Petersen and Eddie Hodges) a single song before shipping them off to boarding school, never to be seen again.  Why couldn't they have done the same thing with their dreary daughter?Other than that, Greer Garson was elegant, Gladys Cooper was all nasty in the best way possible, so too a much underused Geraldine Page.  Hermione Baddeley was amusing.  Tommy Steele was all teeth and a wink.  His song (Fortuosity) was the only one I could remember afterwards and not in a good way.I wouldn't label it the worst musical ever set to film.  I did enjoy most of it.  I'm definitely keeping it in my collection and wouldn't hesitate to watch it again.  But.  If it was ever rereleased, I'd never buy the original soundtrack.

The edition would be helped by remastering the film; the color is washed out, the sound could be remixed. That would happen were this a ""Disney Classic"" and not a Vault Disney style budget release. But that would also price it out of its market. What of the show? This film is hurt by the comparisons with Mary Poppins, a film in which many viewers feel Walt got everything right. On it's own, however, it stands up quite well.It's a film from a musical from a book, and hearkens back to a nearly forgotten time when kids could buy books in school for 50 cents from little newspapers by Scholastic Book Services circulated on Weekly Reader day. One of these was a skinny b&w; photo story from this movie. Live action Disney films were just as anticipated as the animated features. How happy they are again being released in affordable versions. The flyer in this DVD case lists three more Fred Mac Murray films: Son of Flubber, Follow Me, Boys, and the even less seen Bon Voyage.This film was poised at the cusp, as it were, of what may be seen as the end of classic Disney or the rise of a shift in entertainment, as its release coincided with the Summer of Love and the Beatles' Sgt Pepper album. Everything before that time was effectively buried and is only now being unearthed.This film was directed by Norman Tokar, with Pat Paulsen from The Donna Reed Show in a minor role. It marked the film debut of John Davidson, who would become a household name and have his own variety TV show. The film's tone is hundreds of times more optimistic than anything now. If it won't win Best Musical, the songs are nevertheless quite stick-in-your head memorable. If the acting seems damped and restrained, it's somewhat due to the subdued ""millionaire"" setting, amid which MacMurray and the Biddles stand out as non-conformists or rugged individualists. But there are plenty of action scenes: boxing, bar fights, live alligators, and Tommy Steele as the indefatigable Irish butler. Films like this were made for the big screen, for the Saturday afternoon matinee. That's their true home, where they play best.The ""Restored Roadshow Edition"" is, frankly, odd. Having not seen the shorter version, I have no idea how much this 172 minute cut exceeds it in length, but there are title cards reading ""Overture"" at the beginning, ""Intermission"" in the middle, and ""Exit"" at the end, clearly meant for theater-going crowds. These add a bit of time on their own. In sum, I think any fan of early Disney would like this film. It would qualify for the way overused term ""Disney Classic"" not by being splashy and lavish, but because it likely fulfill's Walt's vision for his films. It's odd and unique, and may leave you wondering, as it did me, why can't they make films like this today?",5,What's Wrong with That?,1242691200,"05 19, 2009",2009,2849,"['could', 'rate', 'four', 'stars', 'edition', 'gave', 'five', 'show', 'edition', 'would', 'be', 'helped', 'remastering', 'film', 'color', 'washed', 'out', 'sound', 'could', 'be', 'remixed', 'would', 'happen', 'were', 'Disney', 'Classic', 'not', 'Vault', 'Disney', 'style', 'budget', 'release', 'would', 'also', 'price', 'market', 'What', 'show', 'film', 'hurt', 'comparisons', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'film', 'many', 'viewers', 'feel', 'Walt', 'got', 'everything', 'right', 'own', 'however', 'up', 'quite', 'well.It', 'film', 'musical', 'book', 'back', 'nearly', 'forgotten', 'time', 'when', 'kids', 'could', 'buy', 'books', 'school', '50', 'cents', 'little', 'newspapers', 'Scholastic', 'Book', 'Services', 'circulated', 'Weekly', 'Reader', 'day', 'One', 'was', 'skinny', 'b', 'w', 'story', 'movie', 'Live', 'action', 'Disney', 'films', 'were', 'just', 'as', 'anticipated', 'animated', 'features', 'How', 'happy', 'are', 'again', 'being', 'released', 'affordable', 'versions', 'flyer', 'DVD', 'case', 'three', 'more', 'Fred', 'Mac', 'Murray', 'films', 'Son', 'Flubber', 'Follow', 'Me', 'Boys', 'even', 'less', 'seen', 'Bon', 'Voyage.This', 'film', 'was', 'poised', 'cusp', 'were', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'seen', 'end', 'classic', 'Disney', 'rise', 'shift', 'entertainment', 'release', 'coincided', 'Summer', 'Love', 'Beatles', 'Sgt', 'Pepper', 'album', 'Everything', 'time', 'was', 'effectively', 'buried', 'only', 'now', 'being', 'unearthed.This', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Norman', 'Tokar', 'Pat', 'Paulsen', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'Show', 'minor', 'role', 'marked', 'film', 'debut', 'John', 'Davidson', 'who', 'would', 'become', 'household', 'name', 'have', 'own', 'variety', 'TV', 'show', 'film', 'tone', 'hundreds', 'times', 'more', 'optimistic', 'anything', 'now', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'Best', 'Musical', 'songs', 'are', 'nevertheless', 'quite', 'stick-in-your', 'head', 'memorable', 'acting', 'damped', 'restrained', 'somewhat', 'due', 'subdued', 'millionaire', 'setting', 'MacMurray', 'Biddles', 'stand', 'out', 'non-conformists', 'rugged', 'individualists', 'are', 'plenty', 'action', 'scenes', 'boxing', 'bar', 'fights', 'live', 'alligators', 'Tommy', 'Steele', 'indefatigable', 'Irish', 'butler', 'Films', 'were', 'made', 'big', 'screen', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'matinee', 'true', 'home', 'where', 'play', 'best.The', 'Restored', 'Roadshow', 'Edition', 'frankly', 'Having', 'not', 'seen', 'shorter', 'version', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'much', '172', 'minute', 'cut', 'length', 'are', 'title', 'cards', 'reading', 'Overture', 'beginning', 'Intermission', 'middle', 'Exit', 'end', 'clearly', 'meant', 'theater-going', 'crowds', 'add', 'bit', 'time', 'own', 'sum', 'think', 'fan', 'early', 'Disney', 'would', 'like', 'film', 'would', 'qualify', 'way', 'overused', 'term', 'Disney', 'Classic', 'not', 'being', 'splashy', 'lavish', 'likely', 'fulfill', 'Walt', 'vision', 'films', 'odd', 'unique', 'may', 'leave', 'wondering', 'did', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'films', 'today']",N/A

My youngest daughter liked it quite a bit when she was 4-7, and it became part of the regular rotation of comfort films.

468004,A1M9DQDGE07Q0U,6305512094,Nix Pix,"[20, 29]","Walt Disney's was a visionary film pioneer; he took the fledgling craft of animation and transformed it into an art form of the highest order, and, in the process, altered our collective perception of what childhood is all about. However, occasionally that vision was marred by Disney's own lack of foresight into changing audience tastes. By the end of the 1950s the Walt Disney Studios had incurred huge expenses on Disney's foray into live action films, the birth of his theme park - Disneyland - and the lack luster box office response to his most recent and most expensive animated feature - Sleeping Beauty. Though the old master was set to recoup his losses, the sumptuously mounted, though often dismal, The Happiest Millionaire (released the year after Disney's death) was the personal and financial failure that rounded out Disney's tenure as the mogul of one of Hollywood's great cinema dream factories.Throughout the 1950s and 60s road show engagements for movies of distinction were quite common. Road shows were designed to elevate movies to the lofty ambitions of live theater. They usually began with a lush orchestrated prelude, included an intermission half way through, and exit music to escort audiences out of the theater after the final credit sequence. One often dressed up for this sort of premiere event, certainly paid extra to attend and was often provided with a printed program as a keep sake from the occasion. Disney had attempted the road show only once before, on Fantasia (1940) and the result had been an unqualified financial disaster.  What a pity then, that The Happiest Millionaire - what should have been an eighty-minute tune-filled - if antiseptic and sexless - melodrama, is over inflated into a gargantuan three hours spectacle that, quite simply, fails to dazzle.The plot is a fictionalized account of real life circumstances that concern an eccentric Philadelphia millionaire, Anthony J. Drexel Biddle (Fred MacMurray). He runs a combination Bible and physical fitness college of sorts, loves boxing and keeps alligators in a solarium adjacent his dining room. When immigrant John Lawless (Tommy Steele) becomes Biddle's new butler he does indeed find his new surroundings rather odd. Not that Lawless isn't odd himself - it's just that, unlike Biddle's quirkiness, which can be grating to the point of distraction, Lawless becomes a genuinely loveable reprobate of congenial good humor, thanks to Tommy Steele's remarkable performance. The plot is thread bare to the point of nonexistent. It concerns Biddle's only daughter, Cordelia (Lesley Ann Warren). She's a sort of tomboy desperate to be feminine and sent off to a lady's finishing school where she meets and becomes engaged to New Yorker Angie Duke (John Davidson). Mrs. Duke (Geraldine Page) is social snob but Angie doesn't share her values. He wants to forgo the family business and build automobiles in Detroit. True to Disney form, everything does indeed work out in the end with Angie and Cordelia driving off toward an unintentionally apocalyptic matte painting that depicts the Motor City as something of a cross between Blade Runner and Mary Poppins, a glowering jungle of towering chimneys blackening the skies with the aftershocks of modernity.Plot construction is problematic; As Cordelia's mother, Greer Garson is given extremely little to do. One of Disney's good luck charms - Hemione Baddeley has even less of a say. Equally curious is the fact that after the film takes great pains to introduce the Biddle two sons Tony and Livingston (Paul Petersen and Eddie Hodges) - even giving them a song - it suddenly loses interest in their character development by sending them off to school where, as an audience, we forget that they ever existed.Of course, the plot - such as it is - would be largely forgivable if Disney's resident song writers, the Sherman Brothers had come up with a score worthy of their best endeavors.  Tommy Steele opens the show with a bang with, Fortuosity, but the rest of the score does not live up to expectations and, in spots, is painfully sweet and cuddly. Valentine Candy or Boxing Gloves is so coy one wishes for the elegant Tommy Steele to burst into the room and tap dance its treacle into silence. All in all, Steele is remarkably well served by the score, belting out I'll Always Be Irish and several other songs with such austerity and charm that he easily dismisses the awkward lyrics. His choreography by Mark Breaux and Dee Dee Wood showcase Steele's finer points, particularly in the barroom number that closes the second half of the show. Unfortunately, there are no memorable showstoppers that leave one with a sudden urge to run out and buy the soundtrack or even leave the theater humming.THE TRANSFER: This re-released DVD of The Happiest Millionaire is about as dismal as the film itself. Everything's present: the Overture, Entr'acte and Exit music, but the transfer is not enhanced for widescreen televisions. Unlike the previously available DVD from Anchor Bay, colors seem somewhat more dated this time around and fine details breaks apart with a considerable amount of pixelization and edge enhancement, especially when viewed on a larger monitor.  There are also several cases where mis-registration of the camera negative results in an excessively blurry print - something else absent on Anchor Bay's version. This DVD compresses the entire running time on one side of the disc, which I suspect is the biggest problem. There are no extras, not even the trailer.BOTTOM LINE: Get the Anchor Bay version instead!",3,"NOT THE HAPPIEST, BUT CERTAINLY THE MOST TYPICAL FROM DISNEY",1087862400,"06 22,

468005,A2JLK1SQ8O03EO,6305512094,octobercountry,"[2, 2]","I was sorry to hear of the death of Robert Sherman a few days ago, and this week I'm holding my own personal tribute to his memory by watching some of the films which the Sherman brothers worked on.  And so tonight I watched the 1967 musical ""The Happiest Millionaire,"" a DVD I've had at hand for a few months but hadn't yet viewed. I may have seen this film when I was quite young, but I had no recollection of any specifics of the film whatsoever.Yikes. This is a film I really wanted to like---and was expecting to enjoy---but man, did it fall flat. I found it incredibly dull and slow-moving; true enough, I viewed the original cut of the longer roadshow version, but I don't think any number of trims would have brought this to life.Problems? Well, sad to say the score was second-string; nowhere near the best of what the Sherman Brothers were capable. The juvenile leads, while attractive, were colourless and uninteresting. And perhaps most troublesome, I gather that we were supposed to find MacMurray's title character a loveable eccentric? Instead he was an insufferable bore; an irritating jerk.Holy cow, this film dragged on and on and I was hard-pressed to maintain any interest in the proceedings. It wasn't terrible, but it certainly wasn't particularly good either.Now, to be fair, there were things I liked about it. I appreciated the period sets and decor, and the real pleasure of the film came in seeing some all-time Hollywood greats like Greer Garson, Gladys Cooper, and Geraldine Page in primary roles. But even they couldn't enliven the leaden script to any great degree. For me personally, the ONLY time that the film came to life was when Geraldine Page was on the screen. Unfortunately, she didn't even show up until after the half-way point, and all her scenes put together probably didn't add up to much more than 15 or 20 minutes of screen time---just a drop in the bucket compared to the overall running time of 172 minutes. (Though to be accurate, some of those oh-sooooo-long minutes of total running time were taken up with the overture, intermission, and exit music.)Sorry to say that I didn't find any of the songs the least bit memorable---I would have to say that this is easily my least-favourite Sherman brothers film, out of all I've seen.Still, I'm not sorry I viewed it this one time. And I may even cue through it every now and again, to re-watch those portions of the film featuring Geraldine Page. But I can't imagine that I'll bother ever watching it right through again. My two-star rating may seem a bit harsh, but I really couldn't summon up the enthusiasm to give it three stars.",2,So disappointing,1331078400,"03 7, 2012",2012,2631,"['was', 'sorry', 'hear', 'death', 'Robert', 'Sherman', 'few', 'days', 'ago', 'week', ""'m"", 'holding', 'own', 'personal', 'tribute', 'memory', 'watching', 'films', 'Sherman', 'brothers', 'worked', 'so', 'tonight', 'watched', '1967', 'musical', 'Happiest', 'Millionaire', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'had', 'hand', 'few', 'months', 'had', ""n't"", 'yet', 'viewed', 'may', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'quite', 'young', 'had', 'recollection', 'specifics', 'film', 'whatsoever.Yikes', 'film', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', '-and', 'was', 'expecting', 'enjoy', '-but', 'man', 'did', 'fall', 'flat', 'found', 'incredibly', 'dull', 'slow-moving', 'true', 'enough', 'viewed', 'original', 'cut', 'longer', 'roadshow', 'version', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'number', 'trims', 'would', 'have', 'brought', 'life.Problems', 'Well', 'sad', 'say', 'score', 'was', 'second-string', 'nowhere', 'best', 'what', 'Sherman', 'Brothers', 'were', 'capable', 'juvenile', 'attractive', 'were', 'colourless', 'uninteresting', 'perhaps', 'most', 'troublesome', 'gather', 'were', 'supposed', 'find', 'MacMurray', 'title', 'character', 'loveable', 'eccentric', 'Instead', 'was', 'insufferable', 'bore', 'irritating', 'jerk.Holy', 'cow', 'film', 'dragged', 'was', 'hard-pressed', 'maintain', 'interest', 'proceedings', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'good', 'either.Now', 'be', 'fair', 'were', 'things', 'liked', 'appreciated', 'period', 'sets', 'decor', 'real', 'pleasure', 'film', 'came', 'seeing', 'all-time', 'Hollywood', 'greats', 'Greer', 'Garson', 'Gladys', 'Cooper', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'primary', 'roles', 'even', 'could', ""n't"", 'enliven', 'leaden', 'script', 'great', 'degree', 'personally', 'ONLY', 'time', 'film', 'came', 'life', 'was', 'when', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'was', 'screen', 'Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'show', 'up', 'half-way', 'point', 'scenes', 'put', 'together', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'much', 'more', '15', '20', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', '-just', 'drop', 'bucket', 'compared', 'overall', 'running', 'time', '172', 'minutes', 'be', 'accurate', 'oh-sooooo-long', 'minutes', 'total', 'running', 'time', 'were', 'taken', 'up', 'overture', 'intermission', 'exit', 'music', 'Sorry', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'songs', 'least', 'bit', 'memorable', '-I', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'easily', 'least-favourite', 'Sherman', 'brothers', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen.Still', ""'m"", 'not', 'sorry', 'viewed', 'one', 'time', 'may', 'even', 'cue', 'now', 'again', 're-watch', 'portions', 'film', 'featuring', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', ""'ll"", 'bother', 'ever', 'watching', 'right', 'again', 'two-star', 'rating', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'harsh', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'summon', 'up', 'enthusiasm', 'give', 'three', 'stars']",N/A

468007,AJGP5XYKKBGBG,6305512094,Reliable Reviews,"[2, 3]","""The Happiest Millionaire"" is not pleasingly perfect in every way. I enjoyed it, but I had to work at it. Some songs of humor. Quite surprisingly, Fred MacMurray, usually stoic (not showing emotion), is a good singer who can carry a high note for some time. His song with Greer Garson, at the end, is good.The film is more interesting if you know that the film was based upon a true story; there really was a millionaire Mr. Biddle, who owned alligators which froze and thawed, ran a Bible study for reformed drunks, had a boxing ring, practiced Judo, smoked to cure his asthma, and had trouble keeping servants, until he hired a butler from Ireland, all in the book ""My Philadelphia Father"". Truth is stranger than fiction, so much so, the truth appears unbelievable in the film. When you compare this film to the generally bad television and films of today, it is entertaining. Musicals I recommend solidly ahead of this one are: Disney's ""Summer Magic"", the 1937 ""Maytime"", and ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"".The same Sherman brothers who wrote the songs for ""Mary Poppins"", and the same dance choreographer. However, I do not believe Walt was really involved, and you can tell the difference. Mr. Disney was involved in the immense challenge of starting Disney World, secretly buying up land in Florida, running Disneyland in California, planning a ski resort, running the Cal Arts school, running his animation studio, producing several other films, spending more time on vacation with his family, and dying in the advanced stages of lung cancer; he did not live to see this film released. The film is a comedy, with some silliness, needing better plot, more focus, and more grounding stability. The acting is often veiled and distant, with glimpses of joy. Tommy Steele is good as the singing, dancing, butler, puzzled by it all. The opposing wealthy family matriarchs (mother-in-law, grandmother or aunt) singing about their wealthy family being better than the other is funny.This silly film with a weak script, and without depth, has some fun songs, and humor that is interesting if you know it really is a true story.There are three formats on Amazon, two of the formats are 20 minutes longer. The third Road Show Edition, is twice as much money as the other two, apparently only for wide-screen.

However, some of the big hits I managed to see first hand, and this isnt one of them. The Happiest Millionaire I saw thru previews, trailers, outakes, etc. but never the whole film, until now. Wow, I was actually impressed because I knew that this was Mr. Disney's last effort to capture the Mary Poppins crowd, and it didnt completely work at the time. That I knew. I think the bad thing was that the songs werent exciting as Mary Poppins, and many other fine Disney productions. I think, however, that the songs are actually secondary to the pretty good story involving Lesley Ann Warren and handsome John Davidson. Then there's the over the top upper crust stigma dripping wildly from Miss Geraldine Page as John Davidson's overwhelming mother. Wow, again. The songs are forgettable, except for Tommy Steele's opening number, and the interior mansion sets are Disney dazzling. I am very glad that the Disney studios are supplying hungry audiences with dvd updates to many of their films giving a chance for those once loved these films, and those who finally wish to see them in their entirety.

Fred McMurray is cast as the multi-millionaire Biddle heir (the Biddles arrived in America not long after the Mayflower). The Drexel-Biddles are old-stock Philadelphia, Biddle is an uncommon man in an era of conventionality, especially among the aristocracy. He loves boxing and built his own ring in the old stables, and started the Biddle Bible Clubs; he also captured 20+ alligators in Florida and keeps them in pools in the conservatory of his house (all of this is documented). His aunt Mary Drexel, a role captured beautifully by Gladys Cooper lives &#34;just around the corner&#34; from the Biddles, and she attempts to bring some order to the chaotic household. When daughter, (Leslie Ann Warren) is sent away to school, she falls in love with the heir to the Duke fortune, Algier Buchanan Duke (John Davidson). The differences between the wealthy Dukes (new money) and the Biddles (old money) is charmingly captured in song. Geraldine Page (Mrs.Sarah Duke) and Cooper (Aunt Mary Drexel) duel ever so cleverly over the differences in social mores between NYC and Philadelphia, the talky-singy duet, &#34;There Are Those&#34; points out these social more differences. It is a movie the whole family will probably enjoy. Following on the heels of Mary Poppins, the movie didn't do as well at the box office, probably because the music isn't as singable as the music from the prior Disney hit, but the movie seems to be making a well-deserved come-back now that it is on DVD. Greer Garson is lovely as Biddle's wife; low-key and elegant, she is the perfect foil for his mad-cap parenting style. The Duke University, of course, is named for the Duke family, and Sarah Duke is memorialized in the Duke gardens on the university grounds.

468013,A96K1ZGW56S2I,6305512094,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[6, 8]","Once upon a time I was involved in a discussion about favorite movies and someone said that their favorite film of all time was THE HAPPIEST MILLIONAIRE.  I had never heard of the film before.  The person told me that the film was a corny Disney musical starring Fred MacMurray.  After now having seen the film for myself, I agree that the film is kind of corny, but it is full of enough quirky and eccentric moments to make it beguiling.Released in 1967 THE HAPPIEST MILLIONAIRE was the first of a set of musicals that Disney produced in an attempt to capture the success of the highly popular MARY POPPINS.  The studio had high hopes for the film.  The movie was adapting from a popular (but now mostly forgotten) Broadway stage show of the same name that was in itself adapted from a popular memoir of the time, MY PHILADELPHIA FATHER.  The same songwriting pair of MARY POPPINS was hired to write the songs and lyrics for the show.  Tommy Steele was cast as the Irish butler who serves as a semi-narrator through parts of the show, Fred MacMurray was cast in the title-role of Anthony J. Drexel Biddle, the Happiest Millionaire, and the beautiful and talented Lesley Ann Warren of recent CINDERELLA fame was cast as Cordelia `Cordy' Drexel Biddle.  To top it all off, the film was overseen by Walt Disney himself and was the last live-action film that he ever was involved with.The film didn't live up to expectations.  Initially it only made $5 million and the only Oscar nomination was for costumes.  The movie was also apparently panned by critics at the time thus regulating it to the unknown status it has retained for sometime.  There isn't anything outstanding about THE HAPPIEST MILLIONAIRE and there isn't much of a plot.  Yet, what the film lacks in substance it makes up for in charm.Taking place in 1916 Philadelphia the movie is basically a story about a daughter's coming of age and the changing relationship between herself and her beloved father.  Anthony J. Drexel Biddle was a real life eccentric millionaire who kept alligators in his mansion, led Bible classes that involved boxing, was trained in judo, and became an officer in the U.S. Marines when he was over forty to train young cadets in hand-to-hand combat.  The movie begins with the arrival of the Biddle's new butler, John Lawless (Tommy Steele) straight off the boat from Ireland.  Lawless serves as a pseudo-narrator through parts of the film.  We first meet the Biddles through Lawless' eyes and from time to time he discusses with the audience about the events taking place on screen.  Anthony Biddle's daughter Cordy (Lesley Ann Warren) is growing up and wishes to leave for school.  Her father is opposed to the idea, but eventually consents.  Cordy leaves and soon finds herself in love and engaged to a wealthy New Yorker named Angie Duke (John Davidson).  These two love birds are madly in love, but Cordy is from Philadelphia and Angie is from New York and their families live in completely different worlds.I found THE HAPPIEST MILLIONAIRE to be enjoyable, but in a hit and miss fashion.  The sets and costumes are quite lovely, the acting is decent, and the singing and dance numbers are reminiscent of the days of a beautiful by-gone era.  I like Fred MacMurray and his role in the film and I got a kick out of Tommy Steele's performance as John Lawless.  Actually, most of the cast is quite good.  Yet, the film just doesn't stand out.  Most of the songs are quite entertaining but other ""Fortuosity"", ""Let's Have a Drink On It"", and the bittersweet ""It Wont' Be Long"" there aren't any memorable tunes.  There really isn't much plot to the movie and after awhile some of the antics seem repetitive.  Instead of a concise, well-told story, the movie feels more like a series of scenes and sketches that are loosely connected by the relationship between the characters.  Such a device often works well in a book, can sometimes be pulled off on stage, but usually doesn't make for a very good movie especially a musical.THE HAPPIEST MILLIONAIRE is a movie worth watching once.  Though it doesn't really standout in any way, it can be seducing with its charm.  It's not a movie I'll probably watch again for awhile, but I do want to read and research more about the real-life Anthony Biddle.",3,"""JOHN! My alligators! Look at my alligators!
