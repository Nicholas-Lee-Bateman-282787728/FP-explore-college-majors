478313,A1NLLX3IZAQUFI,6305797110,CyberLouis,"[2, 4]","Once called &quot;The Clairvoyant&quot;, The Killing Hour is a  suspense/thriller/murder mystery rolled into one.  Personally, I prefer the  original title, since it better captures a key element of the story.  Our  protagonist (played by Elizabeth Kemp) has two unique gifts. She is an  artist and has a sixth sense.  But she doesn't see dead people, instead she  can foresee who will be the next victim in a series of seemingly unrelated  murders.  Unrelated that is, except for the handcuffs found on each victim.  Her clairvoyance strikes her when she is drawing and usually, she draws  the next victim.  She begins to panic, when during one of her episodes, she  draws herself.When she finally goes to the police, she manages to  convince the skeptical officers assigned to the murders that their may be  some validity to her story.  More willing to believe her,  a TV talk show  host/reporter (played by Perry King) tries to befriend her and interview  her on his show.Slowly, the killer moves in on her.  The clairvoyant  knows he (or she) is near, but her power doesn't reveal the face to her.  Nor does the director give this one away.  We have to wait until he is  ready to reveal the killer, but once he does, it all makes perfect  sense.Overall, I found this movie to be a pleasant surprise.  Suspenseful, cleverly written, well acted, it will keep you guessing until  the end, when the killer finally and unexpectedly, is revealed.",4,Murder Mystery  at its Best,965606400,"08 7, 2000",2000,1444,"['Once', 'called', 'quot', 'Clairvoyant', 'quot', 'Killing', 'Hour', 'suspense/thriller/murder', 'mystery', 'rolled', 'one', 'Personally', 'prefer', 'original', 'title', 'better', 'key', 'element', 'story', 'protagonist', 'played', 'Elizabeth', 'Kemp', 'two', 'unique', 'gifts', 'artist', 'sixth', 'sense', ""n't"", 'see', 'dead', 'people', 'instead', 'can', 'foresee', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'next', 'victim', 'series', 'seemingly', 'unrelated', 'murders', 'Unrelated', 'handcuffs', 'found', 'victim', 'clairvoyance', 'when', 'drawing', 'usually', 'next', 'victim', 'panic', 'when', 'one', 'episodes', 'herself.When', 'finally', 'police', 'convince', 'skeptical', 'officers', 'assigned', 'murders', 'may', 'be', 'validity', 'story', 'More', 'willing', 'believe', 'TV', 'talk', 'show', 'host/reporter', 'played', 'Perry', 'King', 'befriend', 'interview', 'show.Slowly', 'killer', 'moves', 'clairvoyant', 'near', 'power', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'face', 'director', 'give', 'one', 'away', 'have', 'wait', 'ready', 'reveal', 'killer', 'once', 'perfect', 'sense.Overall', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'Suspenseful', 'cleverly', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'end', 'when', 'killer', 'finally', 'unexpectedly', 'revealed']",N/A
478314,A13Y57V8MRPUZN,6305797110,Daniel Kepley,"[4, 4]","THE KILLING HOUR (originally titled THE CLAIRVOYANT) is a vivid, well-crafted adult thriller in the tradition of Brian DePalma and the gialli of Mario Bava and Dario Argento. It is also an oasis from the teen-slasher craze at the time. A body is discovered floating in the Hudson River with handcuffs. Soon two more murders involving handcuffs ensue and the police, including detective/comedian Larry Weeks (Norman Parker, who is incredible), is on the case. But so is talk-show host Paul ""Mac"" McCormick (soap star Perry King), who does exactly what the police didn't want to happen: turn the killings into a media spectacle. And soon a young art student named Virna Nightbourne (Elizabeth Kemp), who can mysteriously sketch each murder as they happen, becomes involved.This film is kind of like EYES OF LAURA MARS as it would have been directed by Bava or Argento. But I will say that director Armand Mastroianni (HE KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE, which featured Kemp) can accomplish so much while showing so little in terms of the murder sequences! In fact, the pool murder, cast in an ominous red glow, looks like something Argento or Bava would have come up with. Also, the music score (by Alexander Peskanov, who scored ALONE with his brother Mark) resembles something Pino Donnagio would have composed for DePalma. And after all, why go for graphic violence when you have such fine performances, especially from character actors Kenneth McMillan and Joe Morton? This thriller is definetly worth your time!In terms of extras, there's a fun and insightful commentary by Mastroianni and then Anchor Bay head Bill Lustig, who talk about how the film came to be (William Friedkin was involved) among other things. We also get five deleted scenes (obviously cut to speed up the movie), one of which ended up in the trailer. Best of all, it's an unrated director's cut!

478315,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,6305797110,Dave. K,"[4, 6]","The Killing Hour is one of those movies that's full of potential, but never quite reaches it. The one thing you should know rather quickly is the killer is a character already in the movie and not someone who pops up at the end. You should figure out quickly who it actually is, but there a few scenes that might make you 2nd guess that. But it's not really a surprise, on who the killer is, but their motive is the twist that while is fairly interesting, one would think the police would figure it out. It's one of those twists you have to watch what you say or the whole movie will be spoiled and while again the twist is fairly good, but not sure how the cops wouldn't figure it out.The screenplay by Jonathon Ringkamp was the biggest problem with the movie, while not poorly written it's just that the characters lack any depth and really aren't all that interesting. The concept was quite interesting, but the screenplay is the downfall here. Again it's not poorly written, but the characters just aren't interesting, which wouldn't be so bad had the movie focus on the murders. Since its more character driven well you need solid characters something this doesn't have.Director Armand Mastroianni made his directorial debut with the slasher flick He Knows You're Alone, which was actually the very first film Tom Hanks appeared in; Mastroianni really isn't a bad director, while he's not great or anything he can deliver a well-made movie on a limited budget and while I'm no expert on his career he's done some enjoyable movies. He Knows You're Alone was a solid if not clich&eacute;d slasher flick that was actually shot in Staten Island, Ny where I live and I've actually hung around in the areas it was shot so maybe I'm a bit biased.With the Killing Hour he doesn't make as fun as a movie as his debut, but the problems here are with the writing and not the directing. Mastroianni gets the best out of each scene, but there really wasn't much he could do to make up for the shortcomings of the script. As I stated earlier you should figure out who the killer is rather early, but Mastroianni is able to add some nice touches to make you 2nd guess that.The cast is pretty good with Perry King and Norman Parker give solid performances despite not having the best of material. Elizabeth Kemp as Virna Nightbourne is the strongest character, but is given little to do in the first half and by the time she enters the movie most of the potential is now gone, but Kemp makes the best out of a weak character.Overall The Killing Hour is by no means a bad movie, but never reaches the potential it had. The twist is interesting, but cannot save the movie. In the end it's an alright movie; you could do better, but you can also do a lot worse.",3,Decent,1216598400,"07 21, 2008",2008,2747,"['Killing', 'Hour', 'one', 'movies', 'full', 'potential', 'never', 'quite', 'one', 'thing', 'should', 'know', 'rather', 'quickly', 'killer', 'character', 'already', 'movie', 'not', 'someone', 'who', 'up', 'end', 'should', 'figure', 'out', 'quickly', 'who', 'actually', 'there', 'few', 'scenes', 'might', 'make', '2nd', 'guess', 'not', 'really', 'surprise', 'who', 'killer', 'motive', 'twist', 'while', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'police', 'would', 'figure', 'out', 'one', 'twists', 'have', 'watch', 'what', 'say', 'whole', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'spoiled', 'again', 'twist', 'fairly', 'good', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'cops', 'would', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out.The', 'screenplay', 'Jonathon', 'Ringkamp', 'was', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'not', 'poorly', 'written', 'just', 'characters', 'lack', 'depth', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'concept', 'was', 'quite', 'interesting', 'screenplay', 'downfall', 'here', 'Again', 'not', 'poorly', 'written', 'characters', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'had', 'movie', 'focus', 'murders', 'more', 'character', 'driven', 'well', 'need', 'solid', 'characters', 'something', ""n't"", 'have.Director', 'Armand', 'Mastroianni', 'made', 'directorial', 'debut', 'slasher', 'flick', ""'re"", 'Alone', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'first', 'film', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'appeared', 'Mastroianni', 'really', ""n't"", 'bad', 'director', 'not', 'great', 'anything', 'can', 'deliver', 'well-made', 'movie', 'limited', 'budget', ""'m"", 'expert', 'career', 'done', 'enjoyable', 'movies', ""'re"", 'Alone', 'was', 'solid', 'not', 'clich', 'eacute', 'flick', 'was', 'actually', 'shot', 'Staten', 'Island', 'Ny', 'where', 'live', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'hung', 'areas', 'was', 'shot', 'so', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'bit', 'Killing', 'Hour', ""n't"", 'make', 'as', 'fun', 'movie', 'debut', 'problems', 'here', 'are', 'writing', 'not', 'directing', 'Mastroianni', 'best', 'scene', 'there', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'could', 'do', 'make', 'up', 'shortcomings', 'script', 'stated', 'earlier', 'should', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'killer', 'rather', 'early', 'Mastroianni', 'able', 'add', 'nice', 'touches', 'make', '2nd', 'guess', 'that.The', 'cast', 'pretty', 'good', 'Perry', 'King', 'Norman', 'Parker', 'give', 'solid', 'performances', 'not', 'having', 'best', 'material', 'Elizabeth', 'Kemp', 'Virna', 'Nightbourne', 'strongest', 'character', 'given', 'little', 'do', 'first', 'half', 'time', 'movie', 'most', 'potential', 'now', 'gone', 'Kemp', 'best', 'weak', 'character.Overall', 'Killing', 'Hour', 'bad', 'movie', 'never', 'potential', 'had', 'twist', 'interesting', 'can', 'not', 'save', 'movie', 'end', 'alright', 'movie', 'could', 'do', 'better', 'can', 'also', 'do', 'lot', 'worse']",N/A
