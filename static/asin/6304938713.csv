It has stuck with me since then, mostly because of Alan Arkin's fabulous performance as Ambassador Charles Embrick.  But, also, because of the way the film brings to light for its audience what life was like in Brazil during the miltary dictatorship of 1969 - 1979. And, because of its very understated manner of showing you how this small, underground group of anti-regimists coalesced, got its training, and put its thoughts into actions.  It all feels very real.  No Hollywood-ization here.If you want an entertaining *and* eductional evening, rent or buy &quot;Four Days in September.&quot; You won't be disappointed.",5,Sticks with you,1085184000,"05 22, 2004",2004,706,"['saw', 'quot', 'Four', 'Days', 'September', 'quot', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'U.S.', 'theaters', '1999', 'stuck', 'then', 'mostly', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'fabulous', 'performance', 'Ambassador', 'Charles', 'Embrick', 'also', 'way', 'film', 'light', 'audience', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'Brazil', 'miltary', 'dictatorship', '1969', '1979', 'very', 'understated', 'manner', 'showing', 'how', 'small', 'underground', 'group', 'anti-regimists', 'coalesced', 'got', 'training', 'put', 'thoughts', 'actions', 'feels', 'very', 'real', 'Hollywood-ization', 'here.If', 'want', 'entertaining', '*and*', 'eductional', 'evening', 'rent', 'buy', 'quot', 'Four', 'Days', 'September.', 'quot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",Four Days in September VHS
440626,A1W6PG6E8IGU84,6304938713,Emilio,"[10, 10]","This movie faced a lot of criticism in Brazil for the liberties it took with history. Some criticism dates back to the publication of Fernando Gabeira's book, mainly the fact that Gabeira's importance in the kidnapping is overplayed. Other survivors from the operation claim he did not write the note to the press, as the movie shows. Also, a girl did try to get information from the Ambassador's security man, but she did not spend the night with him (and those who like to spot errors may notice the fact that he calls her by her code name, Ren&eacute;, even though she introduced herself by a different name). And one just has to read other books about those days in Brazil to realize most torturers were sick animals, not guilt-ridden human beings like the guy in the movie.In spite of all these flaws, the movie still works admirably as a snapshot of an era. I understand it was rather easy to sell this movie to the international market because Alan Arkin is in it and the event it is based on involved the kidnapping of an American ambassador. But it would be great if people all over the world could also see another movie titled &quot;Pra Frente Brasil&quot;. The story is fictitious but inspired by actual facts: while the 1970 World Cup is taking place and the whole Brazilian population is glued to television sets, a guy is captured by mistake and tortured to death by the police. Brazil won that World Cup, so the whole country was in a celebratory mood while the horrors of repression were happening in the underground.",5,A great movie in spite of some minor inaccuracies,1085961600,"05 31, 2004",2004,1534,"['movie', 'faced', 'lot', 'criticism', 'Brazil', 'liberties', 'took', 'history', 'criticism', 'back', 'publication', 'Fernando', 'Gabeira', 'book', 'mainly', 'fact', 'Gabeira', 'importance', 'kidnapping', 'overplayed', 'Other', 'survivors', 'operation', 'claim', 'did', 'not', 'write', 'note', 'press', 'movie', 'shows', 'Also', 'girl', 'did', 'try', 'get', 'information', 'Ambassador', 'security', 'man', 'did', 'not', 'spend', 'night', 'who', 'like', 'spot', 'errors', 'may', 'notice', 'fact', 'code', 'name', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'even', 'introduced', 'different', 'name', 'one', 'just', 'read', 'other', 'books', 'days', 'Brazil', 'realize', 'most', 'torturers', 'were', 'sick', 'animals', 'not', 'guilt-ridden', 'human', 'beings', 'guy', 'movie.In', 'spite', 'flaws', 'movie', 'still', 'admirably', 'snapshot', 'era', 'understand', 'was', 'rather', 'easy', 'sell', 'movie', 'international', 'market', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'event', 'based', 'involved', 'kidnapping', 'American', 'ambassador', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'people', 'world', 'could', 'also', 'see', 'movie', 'titled', 'quot', 'Pra', 'Frente', 'Brasil', 'quot', 'story', 'fictitious', 'inspired', 'actual', 'facts', '1970', 'World', 'Cup', 'taking', 'place', 'whole', 'Brazilian', 'population', 'glued', 'television', 'sets', 'guy', 'captured', 'mistake', 'tortured', 'death', 'police', 'Brazil', 'won', 'World', 'Cup', 'whole', 'country', 'was', 'celebratory', 'mood', 'horrors', 'repression', 'were', 'happening', 'underground']",Four Days in September VHS

440629,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,6304938713,Linda Linguvic,"[7, 7]","Based on a memoir of one of the participants in the kidnap of the American Ambassador in Brazil in 1969, this is a thought provoking film.  We all remember the idealism of the times and the student protests around the globe.  Most of it was aimed at governments, which needed reform, but were never the ogres that the protesters claimed they were.  In Brazil, however, it was different.  A military junta had just toppled a democratically elected government.  All civil rights had been suspended and terror reigned.A small group of radical students became revolutionaries.  Clearly they were over their heads with their dreams of freedom.  A bungled bank robbery caused one of the students to be tortured and imprisoned.  Something drastic had to be done.  Several hard-boiled older radicals came to assist them and the plan for the kidnap was hatched. How it played out is the brought to the screen by Bruno Baretto, as all the participants from the student dreamer played by Pedro Cardoso, to the strong minded woman who saw herself as a revolutionary, played by Fernanda Torres, are shown to be both dangerous and nave.  Alan Arkin is cast as the ambassador and some of the scenes between him and his captors are masterpieces of subtlety and realism.  We see many sides of the problem, including the side of the young policeman who has nightmares because his job forces him to torture prisoners.Instead of making judgment, the film lets the audience experience the realities of the situation, which exacerbates the harshness of the government.  The emotional tenseness never ceases and the audience is drawn into the drama.  As an epilogue it jumps to a later time, when the original radicals, now older and wiser are freed in a prisoner exchange.  As the camera pans their faces, we see how they have changed.The film sets us down in a time and place that is gone now.  Times have changed and so have the methods of idealists.  There is something to learn, however, from this lesson in history.  It is well crafted, brilliantly directed and the actors are superb. No wonder it was nominated for an academy award.

A group of idealistic students join an underground revolutionary group in protest. Out of this climate of paranoia and violence, a bold plan is conceived: a plot to kidnap the U.S. ambassador to Brazil. This true story forms the basis for the excellent film &quot;Four Days in September,&quot; directed by Bruno Barreto.I have seen many historical films, and this is one of the best. There are no cardboard heroes or villains in this film; there are lots of moral shades of gray. Are these students terrorists or freedom fighters? Is the ambassador an innocent victim, or an ally of oppressive forces?Leopoldo Serran's intelligent script is based on Fernando Gabeira's book &quot;O Que E Isso, Companhiero?&quot; The dialogue offers thought-provoking insights into the minds of the individuals involved in these events. The cast gives universally superb performances; particularly impressive is veteran U.S. actor Alan Arkin as Ambassador Charles Elbrick. The film as a whole is well complemented by a memorable musical soundtrack. Barreto's direction is both suspenseful and sensitive.

I'm egyptian, so it is a rarity for me to see a Latin American film. It provides with the extra pleasure of seeing another  culture, one with which I was unfamiliar but was always curious about. The  story of this film, however is a common one. Young Idealists facing the  harsh realities and consequences of action rather than talk. You would  expect this film do be completly one sided but it shows great intelligence  when dealing with the Secret Service agent who can't sleep becuase of the  torture methods he uses on young revolutionaries, he calls them &quot;Young  dreamers&quot; who must be stopped becuase they are controlled by forces  greater than them. Ofcourse the movie doesn't take his side, but its rare  for a political film to be so sympathetic. The character of Jonas is also  fascinating, he orders the other rebels around and chillingly tells them  that he will shoot them if they disobey any orders. He does this in a  passive mannere suggesting efficiency rather than brutality, yet another  subtext is added to his character, when the American ambassador(wonderfully  played by Alan Arkin) observes that &quot;A man can hide himself in a  Revolution&quot;. The ending is both sad and inspiring, the rebels do  eventually succeed in toppling the dictatorship, but as the gather togather  infront of an airplane waiting to deport them to Algeria their is a certain  pain in their eyes, the myths of hotheaded revolution dispelled and the  aftermath of violence setting in.",4,Thoughtful and Intense,952300800,"03 6, 2000",2000,1586,"['knew', 'almost', 'nothing', 'Four', 'Days', 'September', 'when', 'cuaght', 'cable', 'T.V', 'tonight', ""'m"", 'egyptian', 'rarity', 'see', 'Latin', 'American', 'film', 'extra', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'culture', 'one', 'was', 'unfamiliar', 'was', 'always', 'curious', 'story', 'film', 'however', 'common', 'one', 'Young', 'facing', 'harsh', 'realities', 'consequences', 'action', 'rather', 'talk', 'would', 'expect', 'film', 'do', 'be', 'completly', 'one', 'sided', 'great', 'intelligence', 'when', 'dealing', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'becuase', 'torture', 'methods', 'young', 'revolutionaries', 'quot', 'Young', 'dreamers', 'quot', 'who', 'must', 'be', 'stopped', 'are', 'controlled', 'forces', 'greater', 'Ofcourse', 'movie', ""n't"", 'take', 'side', 'rare', 'political', 'film', 'be', 'so', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'Jonas', 'also', 'fascinating', 'orders', 'other', 'rebels', 'chillingly', 'will', 'shoot', 'disobey', 'orders', 'passive', 'mannere', 'suggesting', 'efficiency', 'rather', 'brutality', 'yet', 'subtext', 'added', 'character', 'when', 'American', 'ambassador', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'quot', 'man', 'can', 'hide', 'Revolution', 'quot', 'ending', 'sad', 'inspiring', 'rebels', 'do', 'eventually', 'succeed', 'toppling', 'dictatorship', 'gather', 'togather', 'infront', 'airplane', 'waiting', 'deport', 'Algeria', 'certain', 'pain', 'eyes', 'myths', 'hotheaded', 'revolution', 'dispelled', 'aftermath', 'violence', 'setting']",Four Days in September VHS

""Four Days in September"" is of the quality of ""Missing"", ""Z"", and ""Seven Days in May"".  It does an impressive job of setting the stage and moving quickly to the core of the story.  The main characters and their motivation are always a key part of any good political thriller and this film brings this out very well.  This is impressive since this is a Brazilian movie about Brazilian political situations yet the circumstances are clearly presented so that foreign audiences can easily follow along.  There is an American angle to the film that is also well-presented in that it enables the audience to understand events from multiple perspectives.

440633,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,6304938713,The Mysterious Traveler,"[1, 9]","FOUR DAYS IN SEPTEMBER (1997)Starring Alan Arkin.A Brazialian film in Portugese telling the true story on when in Sept, 1969, a group of Communist terrorists kidnapped the American Ambassador demanding the release of 15 comrades.In spite of a bad first scene and last scene, this historical film--inspired stylistically and successful because of same by THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS---is a mostly satisfying effort. The director intends to make a pro-communist terrorist film but he also wants to persuade by insinuation and subtltly rather than Moscow/Hollywood style blaring shouting and hamfisted progaganda. Thus he creates a film that gives the impression of being mostly fair and balanced thus lulling the viewer into a false sense of trust before ending with the BIG INDOCTRINATION moment. That said, the drawback to this style is that it can be a two edged blade if the viewer is not an ignorant drooling liberal but someone intellegent and informed about how these films work. Thus if one understands the film's deft and sneaky code--which is intended to be understood only by those in Liberal/Communist circles-- then one's enjoyement actually increases demonstrably because not only are we getting a reasonable history lesson but a solid insight into just how the Communist/Liberal mind works. It is like eavesdropping on a conversation between two terrorists.So when the film says that the Brazilain military overthrew a Democratic government what it really means is that they overthrew a Communist Govt. The Terrorists are obviously communists as well..but THE WORD never passes anyones lips. The film portrays the terrorists in a mostly positive manner though not without blemishes. These are not PARTY HEROES of the Moscow sort but naive mostly bumblers whose primary flaw is that they are Middle Class. Thus the film maintains the class warfare so vital to THE PARTY while refraining from condemning these Middle Class Reds who did after all succeed. Alas if only they were workers. The film's attitude towards torture will be shockingly ambivalent to most American viewers currently indoctrinated by the Party Line during the War on Terror. The film presents arguments in regards to the use of torture in fighting terrorists that are both pro and con saying that it is both effective in fighting terrorists and yet a terrible thing. The torturers are portrayed quite sympathetically as are their victims so one might be confused until what one realizes what the film is actually saying---namely that torture against Communist terrorists is bad but, since the Communists may seize power someday and, of course, besides mass murder, the Reds gleefully engage in torture, torture ITSELF as a concept has its positive points. Thus the film is leaving its options open for the future.The military dictatorship that is supposed to oppressing Brazil at this period is mostly off camera. One imagines this is because that this apparently was a police state where Communist terrorists could operate fairly freely, could hang around street corners for nearly an hour waiting to kidnap the American Ambassador while the police cannot even be bothered to investigate, stage massive demonstrations with little real response and where secret police cannot locate terrorists unless the latter order take out chicken and the chicken man then calls the police. So one imagines that this dictatorship was probably not much more onerous than the US under Bill Clinton only with fewer children being burned to death or sent to Communist prison islands at gun point. So yes the film keeps the military dictatorship off camera.The film DOES point out that if the Reds took over there would probably be mass executions but this is put in the mouth of one of the secret police. Still the film never contradicts the statement either. The film takes the old tact of saying that the Communists of the 60s era were really just misguided idealists in a hurry and kind of dumb but, at the end, the film concludes that these self important goonish agents of genocide and totalitarianism were ultimately heroes.But that is the last scene. Before we get there, the viewer is treated to an excellent historical drama that is solidly acted, has a perfect sense of period, is well written and directed that this viewer is going to strongly recommend. Besides how many historical films are there about Brazil???Note. The film was made during the period when the cinema was making the transition from showing characters urinating onscreen to showing them defecating. So this is everyones big chance to see that fine American actor Alan Arkin soil his underwear and then go to the bathroom and do potty on a blue toilet bowl.",2,Well done Communist
