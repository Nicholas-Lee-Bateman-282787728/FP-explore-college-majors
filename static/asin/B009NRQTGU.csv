This evening we began the Masterpiece Theatre's &#34;WUTHERING HEIGHTS&#34; and were disappointed to discover that it is VERY POORLY CAPTIONED - they left off dialogue of some characters, other captions are poorly done with words interspersed with non-words. So we are VERY DISAPPOINTED in this and there are NO SUBTITLES to switch to. We will see about the remaining 2 movies in the set.",3,Warning: The Wuthering Heights is Poorly Captioned,1389225600,"01 9, 2014",2014,518,"['Got', 'collection', 'finally', 'watched', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'last', 'week', 'BEST', 'JANE', 'EYRE', 'have', 'EVER', 'SEEN', 'absolutely', 'magnificent', 'evening', 'began', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', '34', 'WUTHERING', 'HEIGHTS', '34', 'were', 'disappointed', 'discover', 'VERY', 'POORLY', 'CAPTIONED', 'left', 'off', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'other', 'captions', 'are', 'poorly', 'done', 'words', 'interspersed', 'non-words', 'are', 'VERY', 'DISAPPOINTED', 'are', 'NO', 'SUBTITLES', 'switch', 'will', 'see', 'remaining', '2', 'movies', 'set']",N/A
