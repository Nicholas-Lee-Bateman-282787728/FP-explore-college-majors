The director times shifts repeatedly, showing the same event from different perspectives as the film progresses. There is a sense of foreboding throughout. Though quite explicit at times, that's not the real nature of this thoughtful film, which tries to say something about love and mature relationships, and how men and women relate or fail to relate. The theme is universal, though the characters are mostly German. One couple seems to be immigrants. The settings are bleak throughout, which add to the darkness.

Yet, it should not be misconstued as X-rated porn.Even though there is a close-up of someone's Wienerschnitzel in a hotel room, all of these scenes are secondary to the dramatic and well-crafted tales of men and women in modern day Vienna, struggling to come to terms with their sad, sordid and unfulfilling lives.I would, however qualify my 5-Star Rating by noting that this movie is really for serious fans of foreign art films.

As I watched the lives of three dysfunctional couples deconstruct, my mind wandered to the wisdom of the Jewish philosopher Philo of Alexandria: ""Be kind to all, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle."" All three couples are trapped in the same drab high rise apartments that serve as metaphors for their interior landscapes. The bored nurse Eva has an affair with an out of town doctor, but despite their torrid love affair she does not even remember the man's last name; nor do we ever learn her husband's name. The young and needy checkout clerk Sonja fakes a pregnancy to persuade her cheating boyfriend Marco to marry her. He's an immigrant laborer from Yugoslavia, injecting not only class-consciousness but ethnicity and immigration into the film. Despite her efforts to free herself, domestic violence traps Nicole with the jealous and abusive Alex, the third couple. In twists of fate that are more bizarre than important to the plot, the lives of these six people crash and collide, but only as ships passing in the night. Austrian angst buries everyone.

890702,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B0007TZHWA,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[47, 51]","Antares sounds like a reasonably normal film, the story of three couples living in a bleak apartment complex. This is far from an average normal film. This is an explicit film, not only for the intimate moments, but also in the way that people treat each other. The director, G&ouml;tz Spielmann, has sparks of Tom Tykwer in him; he plays with the timeline and three different views of events. There is an ever so slight feeling of Run Lola Run (Run Lola Run).This film is not for everyone. The film opens with a man in the back seat of a cab looking at intimate photographs of a woman. Suddenly the cab is hit by another car and the screen goes black. We are then transported to the horribly mundane life of a very beautiful blonde wife, housewife, nurse, mother; Eva. It turns out that Eva is having an affair with another man. Early in the film there is a very intimate explicit passionate scene between Eva and her lover. There is a shocking contrast between this scene and the following dinner scene with her husband and daughter. The second act of the film, connected through scenes or events from the first act, is of an almost dead looking white, blonde woman that is a cashier at the local grocery store. The second act is about her relationship with an imigrant. The third act is again connected through scenes in the first and second acts, and is about another blonde woman living in a separate building from the first two. This story is about the abusive relationship she has with her estranged husband.This may seem like a detailed description of the plot that might give away some secrets, however, that could not be farther from the truth. This is a multilayered plot that twists over on itself. G&ouml;tz Spielmann has done a magnificant job in painting these interesting characters, and then taken the timeline and completely thrown it out the window.Camera work is impeccible, every shot is locked solid on a tripod. If there were handheld shots, they were smooth and unobtrusive. The choice of framing was outstanding. There is a scene on the train just after Eva's rendezvous at the hotel - Eva is staring straight ahead from the far left of the screen. The rest of the frame is an expanse of black window with faint lights going past. On closer inspection, there is the reflection of another couple in the train, with the man on top of the woman, both are fully clothed, but they are clearly having sex. We hear him say, should we go to your apartment? It's this type of framing and details that are spread throughout the film.If there is one complaint about this film, it's the last 5 minutes. Somehow the director lost his way to closing the film. There is a sort of epilog after the third act is resolved. The film meanders around a little bit trying to find the finish. The director does finally find his way, and the final scene is just about right.The film is not rated by the MPAA, it did achieve and R rating in Canada. This is on the upper end of an R rating, almost to the NC-17 territory. The opening act is the most graphic of scenes. There is both male and female full nudity in this film. This is nowhere near the pronography area at all. Language is not particularly strong. And there is very little violence. However, the film is definately a very mature film.Another fabulous film brought to the US by Film Movements. This is a series to watch if you love independent and often times foreign film. Antares is an intense, explicit film that is very rewarding. If you loved this film, another film in this series that is just as wonderful,Fraulein.",5,Careful Viewing Is Rewarded,1241136000,"05 1, 2009",2009,3584,"['Antares', 'reasonably', 'normal', 'film', 'story', 'three', 'couples', 'living', 'bleak', 'apartment', 'complex', 'far', 'average', 'normal', 'film', 'explicit', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'intimate', 'moments', 'also', 'way', 'people', 'treat', 'other', 'director', 'G', 'ouml', 'Spielmann', 'sparks', 'Tom', 'Tykwer', 'timeline', 'three', 'different', 'views', 'events', 'ever', 'so', 'slight', 'feeling', 'Run', 'Lola', 'Run', 'Run', 'Lola', 'Run', '.This', 'film', 'not', 'everyone', 'film', 'man', 'back', 'seat', 'cab', 'looking', 'intimate', 'photographs', 'woman', 'Suddenly', 'cab', 'hit', 'car', 'screen', 'black', 'are', 'then', 'transported', 'horribly', 'mundane', 'life', 'very', 'beautiful', 'blonde', 'wife', 'housewife', 'nurse', 'mother', 'Eva', 'out', 'Eva', 'having', 'affair', 'man', 'Early', 'film', 'very', 'intimate', 'explicit', 'passionate', 'scene', 'Eva', 'lover', 'shocking', 'contrast', 'scene', 'following', 'dinner', 'scene', 'husband', 'daughter', 'second', 'act', 'film', 'connected', 'scenes', 'events', 'first', 'act', 'almost', 'dead', 'looking', 'white', 'blonde', 'woman', 'cashier', 'local', 'grocery', 'store', 'second', 'act', 'relationship', 'imigrant', 'third', 'act', 'again', 'connected', 'scenes', 'first', 'second', 'acts', 'blonde', 'woman', 'living', 'separate', 'building', 'first', 'two', 'story', 'abusive', 'relationship', 'estranged', 'husband.This', 'may', 'seem', 'detailed', 'description', 'plot', 'might', 'give', 'away', 'secrets', 'however', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'farther', 'truth', 'multilayered', 'plot', 'over', 'G', 'ouml', 'Spielmann', 'done', 'magnificant', 'job', 'painting', 'interesting', 'characters', 'then', 'taken', 'timeline', 'completely', 'thrown', 'out', 'window.Camera', 'work', 'impeccible', 'shot', 'locked', 'solid', 'tripod', 'were', 'handheld', 'shots', 'were', 'smooth', 'unobtrusive', 'choice', 'framing', 'was', 'outstanding', 'scene', 'train', 'just', 'Eva', 'rendezvous', 'hotel', 'Eva', 'staring', 'straight', 'ahead', 'far', 'left', 'screen', 'rest', 'frame', 'expanse', 'black', 'window', 'faint', 'lights', 'going', 'past', 'closer', 'inspection', 'reflection', 'couple', 'train', 'man', 'top', 'woman', 'are', 'fully', 'clothed', 'are', 'clearly', 'having', 'sex', 'hear', 'say', 'should', 'go', 'apartment', 'type', 'framing', 'details', 'are', 'spread', 'film.If', 'one', 'complaint', 'film', 'last', '5', 'minutes', 'Somehow', 'director', 'lost', 'way', 'closing', 'film', 'sort', 'epilog', 'third', 'act', 'resolved', 'film', 'meanders', 'little', 'bit', 'trying', 'find', 'finish', 'director', 'finally', 'find', 'way', 'final', 'scene', 'just', 'right.The', 'film', 'not', 'rated', 'MPAA', 'did', 'achieve', 'R', 'rating', 'Canada', 'upper', 'end', 'R', 'rating', 'almost', 'NC-17', 'territory', 'opening', 'act', 'most', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'male', 'female', 'full', 'nudity', 'film', 'nowhere', 'pronography', 'area', 'Language', 'not', 'particularly', 'strong', 'very', 'little', 'violence', 'However', 'film', 'definately', 'very', 'mature', 'film.Another', 'fabulous', 'film', 'brought', 'US', 'Film', 'Movements', 'series', 'watch', 'love', 'independent', 'often', 'times', 'foreign', 'film', 'Antares', 'intense', 'explicit', 'film', 'very', 'rewarding', 'loved', 'film', 'film', 'series', 'just', 'as', 'wonderful', 'Fraulein']",Antares

In  the last scene the camera holds on those concrete homes- each light in a window is a domestic world unto it's own. Antares has shown three domestic situations and they over-lap in some parts. This is the kind of film that improves with another viewing. The film looks simple enough but as in all well done artistically it belies its clarity and perceptiveness.sigh.....in heaven all the soap-operas would be like this ....  There is almost a docu-drama feel to this film as it explores men-women relations in and around the ideas of partnership. There is a quiet irony and a fly-on-the -wall call for compassion because the film's causes happen everyday.It proves that well made film doesn't need the distractions of high-drama or cosmetics to satisfy.Everyone Else is another film like Antares. It is well acted but requires a little patience for a brilliant ending. It involves a German couple. There was enough subelty between them to realise she could not see her blind-spot.

It breaks light into so many shiny sparks just like the seemingly unconnected lives of three couples living in dreary Vienna highrise.I am a long time fan of the Film Movement movies, and it seems that as time goes by their production is getting bolder.  Multi-layered film reflects on lives of today's contemporary couples.  Married, living together, or separated by divorce, these couples face challanges of their personal lives, desires and inability to truly break away from their routines.  They each deal with their mysery by escape into a world of fantasy that is impermanent and just as fragile. How their lives are connected will require you to see this movie, but I promise you, you will not be disappointed.I was suprised by bold choices women in this film make for themselves.  I was also stricken by a classical beauty of the actress playing Sonja, young grocery store clerk, needy and insecure, who wants to salvage her relationship with young eastern european immigrant Marko by any means possible, even by faking the pregnancy.
