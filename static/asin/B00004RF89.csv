David himself is a Minnesota native and attended the same school when he was a boy. The Learys' new neighbor is Art Lundstrom(Jeffrey Tambor) and his wife Betty(Faith Prince). The Lundstroms immediately welcomed the Learys upon the Learys' arrival. ""We won't need the Weather Channel while they're living next door to us."",David tells Ben. Art noticed some ugly cracks in the Learys' deck and offered some of his stain for replenishing the deck. Art says,""Make sure you apply a few extra coats otherwise the moisture will seep into the wood and rot it from the inside."". Art tells about the biting sunfish at Lake Rebecca. Also he offers his tuba to Ben. Ben hates Minnesota and would rather stay in California. Ben misses his mother who is David's ex-wife. The next morning,Art is chopping wood in the pleasant sunshine. David's childhood acquaintance Roscoe Bigger(Tom Arnold) comes along and continues to pick on David,despite they're both now adults. Don Knotts is the school principal who has Ben and Roscoe's son Kirby in his office for fighting. Then there's a circulating rumor that David killed Roscoe in a waterfall. David himself believed he committed the murder. All he did was push Roscoe with a long piece of plywood into the waterfall. David tells Art late one evening,while Art was pruning hedges,that David killed shop teacher Roscoe. ""Everyone knows you two had a twisted relationship."",Art tells David. Julianne Phillips plays David's girlfriend,who also teaches at the school. During childhood,Roscoe stole what's called a ""moonrock"" because of his aspiration of becoming an astronaut,which never happened. Eventually,David and Roscoe become friends and both their families move out of Minnesota together. WOOLY BULLY,performed by Sam the Sham & the Pharoahs is played during the opening credits.

Bullying is a serious topic, and it is shown as such, but there is plenty of comedy to keep it from being too depressing or dark of a movie.

Years later, David and his son return to town and David becomes the new creative writing teacher. He finds out that Ross is also a teacher at the same school and continues to bully him again.
