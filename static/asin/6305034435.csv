T ""(b-_-)b""","[0, 0]","The Odd One Dies is another film from Hong Kong's &quot;doom generation&quot; of film making, the 5-7 uneasy years leading up to the hand over of power to communist Chinese control. It is a fresh and occasionally funny film about small-time criminals that oozes with hopelessness, a sentiment representative of many citizens who could not leave Hong Kong. However, what keeps The Odd One Dies from being a completely depressing film like Wong Kar Wai's brooding crime dramas As Tears Go By or Days of Being Wild is Takeshi Kaneshiro, who despite the somber material, has an amazing comic presence (and the film's running joke involving severed fingers doesn't hurt either). The one major fault with The Odd One Dies is the story, which has some neat ideas but tends to meander and lose focus on many occasions.",3,Wanted: script editor,980380800,"01 25, 2001",2001,810,"['Odd', 'One', 'Dies', 'film', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'quot', 'doom', 'generation', 'quot', 'film', 'making', '5-7', 'uneasy', 'years', 'leading', 'up', 'hand', 'power', 'communist', 'Chinese', 'control', 'fresh', 'occasionally', 'funny', 'film', 'small-time', 'criminals', 'hopelessness', 'sentiment', 'representative', 'many', 'citizens', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'leave', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'However', 'what', 'Odd', 'One', 'being', 'completely', 'depressing', 'film', 'Wong', 'Kar', 'Wai', 'brooding', 'crime', 'dramas', 'Tears', 'Go', 'Days', 'Being', 'Wild', 'Takeshi', 'Kaneshiro', 'who', 'somber', 'material', 'amazing', 'comic', 'presence', 'film', 'running', 'joke', 'involving', 'severed', 'fingers', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'one', 'major', 'fault', 'Odd', 'One', 'Dies', 'story', 'neat', 'ideas', 'meander', 'lose', 'focus', 'many', 'occasions']",The Odd One Dies
444883,A2Z9AZNVWKCZN6,6305034435,AZNmovieFan,"[5, 5]","""Odd One Dies"" is a mesmerizing movie. The movie captures a few days in the life of a street urchin (of sorts). Takeshi Kaneshiro gives a stellar performance as a wandering thug, with nothing to lose--until he meets an equally lost soul. The resting love affair is quirky, heartbreaking and incredibly real. The two characters exist on the peripheries of society, in a world where love seems impossible, which makes the relationship between the two that much more powerful. If you enjoyed ""Chungking Express"" but crave something less sweet, this is the movie for you. Also, Takeshi Kaneshiro is in almost every scene.

The DVD cuts out at the 45 minute mark and I couldn't get it to play again.  I tried a DVD player that I have only played a few times and ran into the same problem.  Since no one else on here has had problems, I am guessing they got the Tai Seng version.  So whatever you do DO NOT GET THE MEI-EH/TAI SENG VERSION!!!!!Now it took me over 2 hours to watch this trying to get it to play but I did manage to see about 80 of the 90 minutes.  Luckily I saw the beginning and the end.  The story doesn't exactly explain itself that well at the start but you will proabably figure it out.  Takeshi Kaneshiro is big time gambler who I thought was just a little bit off.  While not the brightest guy, it makes for a VERY interesting character to study.  I don't want to spoil the story because it is actually quite good.  It gets a bit boring in the middle and I didn't like the disbelief part at the end.  This movie is very good but has a hard time staying on track and wanders off pretty far some times.So again, do not get the Mei-Eh version or if you have the Mei-Eh/Tai Seng version, please review how it plays.",4,"Pretty good movie, faulty DVD",1159228800,"09 26, 2006",2006,1220,"['have', 'beg', 'not', 'get', 'DVD', 'distributed', 'Mei-Eh', 'Tai', 'Seng', 'sticker', 'front', 'DVD', 'out', '45', 'minute', 'mark', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'play', 'again', 'tried', 'DVD', 'player', 'have', 'only', 'played', 'few', 'times', 'ran', 'same', 'problem', 'one', 'else', 'here', 'had', 'problems', 'am', 'guessing', 'got', 'Tai', 'Seng', 'version', 'So', 'do', 'DO', 'NOT', 'GET', 'THE', 'MEI-EH/TAI', 'SENG', 'VERSION', 'Now', 'took', '2', 'hours', 'watch', 'trying', 'get', 'play', 'did', 'manage', 'see', '80', '90', 'minutes', 'Luckily', 'saw', 'beginning', 'end', 'story', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'explain', 'that', 'well', 'start', 'will', 'proabably', 'figure', 'out', 'Takeshi', 'Kaneshiro', 'big', 'time', 'gambler', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'not', 'brightest', 'guy', 'VERY', 'interesting', 'character', 'study', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'story', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'bit', 'boring', 'middle', 'did', ""n't"", 'disbelief', 'part', 'end', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'hard', 'time', 'staying', 'track', 'wanders', 'off', 'pretty', 'far', 'times.So', 'again', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'Mei-Eh', 'version', 'have', 'Mei-Eh/Tai', 'Seng', 'version', 'please', 'review', 'how']",The Odd One Dies

His character in this movie can be so  intense at one moment, yet child-like in the next, without saying one word.  Carmen Lee's performance was down-played, but effective,and the extra  characters gave comic relief to this picture that could otherwise have been  a real depressing film.  The music they use usually have the complete  opposite feel as the scene before you, ex. an intense confrontation is  accentuated with what sounds like music from a commercial geared for kids,  yet it goes together so well.  If your in the mood for something a little  different, I would definately recommend seeing this movie for the laugh  factor alone.",4,"A fun movie to watch, if  you like Takeshi, and weird music.",940896000,"10 26, 1999",1999,752,"['love', 'Takeshi', 'have', 'seen', 'alot', 'movies', 'so', 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'character', 'play', 'character', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'intense', 'one', 'moment', 'yet', 'child-like', 'next', 'saying', 'one', 'word', 'Carmen', 'Lee', 'performance', 'was', 'down-played', 'effective', 'extra', 'characters', 'gave', 'comic', 'relief', 'picture', 'could', 'otherwise', 'have', 'been', 'real', 'depressing', 'film', 'music', 'use', 'usually', 'have', 'complete', 'opposite', 'feel', 'scene', 'ex', 'intense', 'confrontation', 'accentuated', 'what', 'like', 'music', 'commercial', 'geared', 'kids', 'together', 'so', 'well', 'mood', 'something', 'little', 'different', 'would', 'definately', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'movie', 'laugh', 'factor', 'alone']",The Odd One Dies
444886,ASFTYWTX1WWFE,6305034435,Shawn McKenna,"[0, 0]","Analogous to Expect The Unexpected (1998) and The Longest Nite (1998) Patrick Yau is the nominal director in The Odd One Dies but did not do the majority of directing (though Yau has stated of those three films he had the most input with this one). The uncredited director is Johnnie To, whose production company is Milkyway Image with Wai Ka-Fai who wrote the screenplay, that was the force behind the film. Aside from those three films (which I have seen) Patrick was credited to one more film The Loser's Club (2001) and apparently his film career has been over since then. However, when watching the movie it is easy to see many familiar elements of To including genre (shashou pian: professional killer genre), incorporation of humor and Lam Suet.Takeshi Kaneshiro is a laconic street thug called Mo who is either on a death wish or just does not care. I see a bit of this character in Louis Koo's performance in Throw Down (2004), but when you watch this it is hard not to think of Takeshi's two previous Wong Kar-wai roles (Chungking Express (1994), Fallen Angels (1995)) as well. Takashi after losing much money in gambling decides to take on a hired killer role for 88,000 HK dollars cash. First he gets himself an old large mobile phone, sunglasses, chain, watch, used car with a capricious bumper and a jacket. How he gets those items is quite hilarious. Since he is just does not care, he gambles a good portion of that money away as well. He loses thousands after thousands, doubling his bet every time with a local card shark named George (Lee Diy-yue), without as much as a wince when he loses. But then the strangest thing happens, he starts to win and he wins big. Then he decides to hire someone else to do the killing.The newly hired killer is, much to his surprise, a female (Carman Lee Yeuk-tung) who is just out of jail from a previous man-slaughter case and she is just as laconic as he is. They both smoke quite a lot and almost appear to be Doppelganger's of each other.* However, she is malodorous and unkempt. They, of course, become attached to each other. Now what is he going to do about the hit?I had a lot of fun watching this movie. I had so much merriment that I did the rare thing and watched it twice within a week which I had not done with another film in years. There is a peculiar comedic style to this that is dark, but still quite good. This includes a recurring fingers dismemberment joke when the Triad character Tony (Korean actor Byun Woo-min) catches a knife from both Takeshi and later Carman is brutally hilarious but also leads to a strong scene of redemption at the end. The direction is also quite quirky. You get a great look of Hong Kong in this film which is another trademark of many of Johnnie To's work. There is an excellent scene of Takeshi running around a busy area crossing one street after another. He is almost hit several times and it is great to see the passerby expression (many of these movies will be filmed with many people not knowing they are being filmed). All filmed with no or very few cuts. In fact it is quite reminiscent to a similar scene in Police Story 2 (1988) with Jackie Chan but with better results for Takeshi.I really wish these early Milkyway films like this one, The Longest Nite (1998) and The Mission (1999) would get more recognition especially amongst more mainstream critics. This has been slowly changing over the years with Stephen Teo's book on Johnnie To as well as David Bordwell adding a section on To in his updated book Planet Hong Kong. But as a fan of these movies such as this one it still is not enough. I know fans of Johnnie To and Hong Kong crime films will enjoy this, but this is a good film for people who are not familiar with those to start with.This Mei Ah R0 1997 DVD is not the easiest film to get a hold of as there is no R1 edition out there or any non-OOP version anywhere. It looks exactly like a LD port and I have read that some copies do not necessarily work on all DVD players. Thank goodness mine did. There are no extras unfortunately. There are Chinese and English subtitles (surprisingly decent subtitles) and Cantonese and Mandarin language tracks. This film is desperately in need of an update and rerelease.Johnnie To has stated that in an interview: ""we didn't deliberately set out to copy Wong Kar-wai. I don't copy other people's stuff. The film is about loneliness and it's possible that it shows a tendency to Wong Kar-wai."" My own personal opinion is that the biggest similarity is Takeshi Kaneshiro's performance. While some have stated the cinematography resembles Wong's work, I feel it is just because of the use of hand-held and overuse of canted angles (possibly more of them then in The Third Man (1949)). The issue of expiring time is familiar (Chungking Express) but I feel that is prevalent of Hong Kong cinema as a whole since the handover was to happen a little over a month after the release of this film. Plus one of the strongest thematic elements for Wong's oeuvre the ever-present ""unrequited love"" is missing from this film.* The Doppelganger is another recurrent theme in To's films as well as the use of motifs. When watching this movie look for a massive amount of scenarios repeated for a second time or third time. The last time the scenario happens it signals a change. For example, when Takeshi meets Simon for the second time he beats him up. When Carmen sees him she fantasizes about killing him, but leaves him without doing anything. When Takeshi tries to stab the Triad member for the third time (Carmen did it the second time), he does not go through with the motion to remove his fingers and ultimately receives the forgiveness of him. Takeshi apologizes to George the third time they meet. There are many more throughout the film sometimes with the Doppelganger taking the place of the protagonist.",5,Quirky and Fun Hong Kong Movie,1293580800,"12 29, 2010",2010,5869,"['Analogous',
