Many things but mostly the writing, acting directing, cinematography, not in this particular order, but altogether.  BEN X is a GREAT film, it is a roller coaster of emotions, it is a constant surprise.  It will take you places you never dreamed of going.  It explores many different subjects and will leave you wanting to tell all your friends to buy or rent BEN X.  I did.  It stands out very tall from thousands of movies made in 2008, and it is more than just about autism. It is about a different person who overcomes his fears and revenge in a very clever way.  When will humanity realize that every creature on earth is special and OK?  When will we learn to accept and tolerate each other for our differences? I can't recommend it enough.

He's a loner in the real world who loses himself as a gamer in the online virtual world. His teachers are empathetic but stymied. Doctors have their theories but offer no practical help. Ben's distraught parents are beside themselves. Much of the film is about the harassment and humiliation Ben receives at school. When one of these despicable episodes is filmed with a cell phone and uploaded to the internet, Ben plots his ""endgame."" His online virtual friend, a young girl named Scarlite, insists upon helping him as his ""healer."" And so they meet in real life and devise their revenge. ""Every night you pray to God that things will work out and be OK,"" laments his father.

1183702,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001DYRL22,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[10, 10]","Descend into the nightmare that autism and mob thinking must be. And accept people that are different as simply being different, not some side show act.This is director Nic Balthazar's first movie. Let me repeat, this is Nic Balthazar's first movie he has ever made. He is the author of the novel on which this film was based. There are directors that are on their 10th film that haven't yet come close to accomplishing what Balthazar has in this first film.There is so much to say about this film, and yet little should be said. The film opens with credits over ArchLord, a video game by Codemasters. This is the first time this reviewer has ever seen a computer game depicted so perfectly in film. It turns out the director collaborated closely with Codemasters to get the game perfect. It even includes the occaisional frame drop jump seen all high detail computer video games. The credits are shown in action boxes, clicked on by an accurate gloved hand.It takes some time to realize that Ben has autism, it's clear something isn't 100% normal about him. The initial clues are snap to extreme close ups of objects that Ben hears and sees. There are scenes of the veins in leaves, hair follicles, and eyes moving. All intercut with blurry views of the rest of the world. The sound is at times deafening. This is the beginning of the descent into, what must be, the nightmare Ben sees every single day. This intercutting technique is not overused and is carried throughout the film.This film has a unique style that is consistent throughout. Another intercut device is interviews with other characters in the film. The interviews are done face to camera, much like a television show (think of the Office, but these people are not being funny) or documentary. These people are also interviewed after the story has taken place, they are relecting on what has happened. They add a foreboding to the story. A teacher says, ""I should have seen this. I should have helped. But what can you do?"" These snipits are revealed perfectly through the story.The key message from this film, people battle with their demons. Ben's demon is autism and people treating him very badly. Instead of staring, we should find ways to accept those people. To not see the differences, just see a person.Please see this film. It is marvelous. It's not easy to watch. But in the end, you will be very pleased that you did watch this film.If the MPAA rated this, it's very likely it would R rated. There is no nudity, well except the scene where Ben has his pants pulled down and his naked behind is very visible. There really isn't much harsh language. There is some violence, mostly kids treating Ben badly. There is a fair amount of discussion about suicide. The film in the rest of the world was rated for older than 12, 13, 14, and 15 (pick your country).In Dutch with English subtitles, which can be turned off. There is no English soundtrack. The English had a wonderful rythmn to it, so I'm assuming the translation is very good.This is a Film Movements release. These discs are very deep with extras. In many ways, Film Movement is to DVD as to what Critereon was to LaserDisc. They have pushed the envelope for small independent film that matters. And they care about film deeply.",5,The Nightmare - Acceptance,1238284800,"03 29, 2009",2009,3263,"['Descend', 'nightmare', 'autism', 'mob', 'thinking', 'must', 'be', 'accept', 'people', 'are', 'different', 'simply', 'being', 'different', 'not', 'side', 'show', 'act.This', 'director', 'Nic', 'Balthazar', 'first', 'movie', 'Let', 'repeat', 'Nic', 'Balthazar', 'first', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'author', 'novel', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'are', 'directors', 'are', '10th', 'film', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'come', 'close', 'accomplishing', 'what', 'Balthazar', 'first', 'film.There', 'so', 'much', 'say', 'film', 'yet', 'little', 'should', 'be', 'said', 'film', 'credits', 'ArchLord', 'video', 'game', 'Codemasters', 'first', 'time', 'reviewer', 'ever', 'seen', 'computer', 'game', 'depicted', 'so', 'perfectly', 'film', 'out', 'director', 'collaborated', 'closely', 'Codemasters', 'get', 'game', 'perfect', 'even', 'occaisional', 'frame', 'drop', 'jump', 'seen', 'high', 'detail', 'computer', 'video', 'games', 'credits', 'are', 'shown', 'action', 'boxes', 'clicked', 'accurate', 'gloved', 'hand.It', 'time', 'realize', 'Ben', 'autism', 'clear', 'something', ""n't"", '100', '%', 'normal', 'initial', 'clues', 'are', 'snap', 'extreme', 'close', 'ups', 'objects', 'Ben', 'sees', 'are', 'scenes', 'veins', 'leaves', 'hair', 'follicles', 'eyes', 'moving', 'intercut', 'blurry', 'views', 'rest', 'world', 'sound', 'times', 'deafening', 'beginning', 'descent', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'nightmare', 'Ben', 'single', 'day', 'intercutting', 'technique', 'not', 'overused', 'carried', 'film.This', 'film', 'unique', 'style', 'consistent', 'intercut', 'device', 'interviews', 'other', 'characters', 'film', 'interviews', 'are', 'done', 'face', 'camera', 'much', 'television', 'show', 'think', 'Office', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'being', 'funny', 'documentary', 'people', 'are', 'also', 'interviewed', 'story', 'taken', 'place', 'are', 'relecting', 'happened', 'add', 'foreboding', 'story', 'teacher', 'should', 'have', 'seen', 'should', 'have', 'helped', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'snipits', 'are', 'revealed', 'perfectly', 'story.The', 'key', 'message', 'film', 'people', 'battle', 'demons', 'Ben', 'demon', 'autism', 'people', 'treating', 'very', 'badly', 'Instead', 'staring', 'should', 'find', 'ways', 'accept', 'people', 'not', 'see', 'differences', 'just', 'see', 'person.Please', 'see', 'film', 'marvelous', 'not', 'easy', 'watch', 'end', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'pleased', 'did', 'watch', 'MPAA', 'rated', 'very', 'likely', 'would', 'R', 'rated', 'nudity', 'well', 'scene', 'where', 'Ben', 'pants', 'pulled', 'down', 'naked', 'behind', 'very', 'visible', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'harsh', 'language', 'violence', 'mostly', 'treating', 'Ben', 'badly', 'fair', 'amount', 'discussion', 'suicide', 'film', 'rest', 'world', 'was', 'rated', 'older', '12', '13', '14', '15', 'pick', 'country', 'Dutch', 'English', 'subtitles', 'can', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'English', 'soundtrack', 'English', 'had', 'wonderful', 'rythmn', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'translation', 'very', 'good.This', 'Film', 'Movements', 'release', 'discs', 'are', 'very', 'deep', 'extras', 'many', 'ways', 'Film', 'Movement', 'DVD', 'what', 'Critereon', 'was', 'LaserDisc', 'have', 'pushed', 'envelope', 'small', 'independent', 'film', 'matters', 'care', 'film', 'deeply']",Ben X

Never showed up on your radar, but when you watch it it nails your head to the wall it's so good. ""Ben X"" is such a movie. It gets everything (well....almost everything) right, and it's a great watch.Here's the scoop. Ben is a very bright high school student. He's one of the smartest in his class, but he's autistic. He took a lot of grief all through grade school and it's not letting up in high school. Many of his classmates taunt him relentlessly. He does have a couple of fellow students and teachers who empathize with him but they're ineffectual. They cannot stop the things that are happening to him. To find refuge he hides out in an on-line video game where he scores mega points and comes to the attention of another, female, player who wants to meet him in the flesh. Things are arranged and lead to a rather peculiar outcome.This is a great movie. The way Ben's autism is captured is remarkable. The way people talk to him and the way he sees/ hears what they're saying to him are wildly different. His mother loves him and cares for him deeply, but she just doesn't get it. Mom and dad are divorced. His dad loves him. Dad's new wife seems to care about him as well, but, like mom, they are of no help to him. When he goes to rendesvous with his game playing pal, it's almost painful to see him in his inability to approach her. The director did an outstanding job of showing us Ben's world.This has a good look to it and the performances are all top shelf. The only reason I'm not giving this the big five stars is the ending. If I were one of the characters sitting where I was sitting and saw what I saw, I might not have reacted the way they all reacted. And what were they saying about his gal pal? I won't spoil anything but you might end up scratching your head. This is still a great movie. It IS Swedish with sub-titles, so factor that into your decision to see it. It IS based on true story (whatever that means)and it IS a great watch.

I dug the video game world as a contrast to his unpleasant life and I also thought the director used color in an interesting way, like when Scarlite (even the name suggests the director had color on his mind) is bright red against a wall of desaturated green.  The lead actor bugged, though.  He was too old and everytime he started bugging his eyes out I thought ""welp, it's scenery-chewing time at the Apollo's amateur hour"".  The trick ending was cool but I could see it coming a mile away--what parent helps their kid commit suicide?  And though I predicted the ending it was at least different, which I appreciated.Another thing that bugged me was the ""based on a true story"" label.  Man, what a cynical trick that label is.  The actual story this was supposed based on was a kid with autism who killed himself.  Movie studios and directors slap that label on because audiences want to think there's reality to their movies and movie studios are only too happy to oblige.Despite its flaws, a well-made movie.",3,Interesting flick,1262649600,"01 5, 2010",2010,1213,"['review', 'people', 'who', ""'ve"", 'already', 'watched', 'movie.Ben', 'X', 'story', '35', 'year-old', 'who', 'still', 'high', 'school', 'reason', 'being', 'tormented', 'Flemish', 'versions', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'dug', 'video', 'game', 'world', 'contrast', 'unpleasant', 'life', 'also', 'thought', 'director', 'used', 'color', 'interesting', 'way', 'when', 'Scarlite', 'even', 'name', 'director', 'had', 'color', 'mind', 'bright', 'red', 'wall', 'desaturated', 'green', 'lead', 'actor', 'bugged', 'though', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'everytime', 'started', 'bugging', 'eyes', 'out', 'thought', 'welp', 'scenery-chewing', 'time', 'Apollo', 'amateur', 'hour', 'trick', 'ending', 'was', 'cool', 'could', 'see', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'what', 'parent', 'kid', 'commit', 'suicide', 'predicted', 'ending', 'was', 'least', 'different', 'appreciated.Another', 'thing', 'bugged', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'label', 'Man', 'what', 'cynical', 'trick', 'label', 'actual', 'story', 'was', 'supposed', 'based', 'was', 'kid', 'autism', 'who', 'killed', 'Movie', 'studios', 'directors', 'slap', 'label', 'audiences', 'want', 'think', 'reality', 'movies', 'movie', 'studios', 'are', 'only', 'too', 'happy', 'oblige.Despite', 'flaws', 'well-made', 'movie']",Ben X

After a dramatic incident at school that is later posted on the internet, Ben is so humiliated that he is contemplating taking his own life. You'll have to see it for yourself how it all pays out.I thought this was a terrific movie, even if several bullying scenes are incredibly hard to watch.

1183708,AKI1CK229BDUC,B001DYRL22,PsyRC,"[1, 3]","I think that the concept of retreating into a fantasy life is notego-alien to most people at some point, as it imbues one with specialabilities and allows a much more rigid control over what happens in ourlives. I'm guessing this may echo more true in the case of people who,for whatever reason, have less sophisticated social skills and feelthreatened by the sometimes daunting task of adapting to thisnihilistic postpostmodern world. Now the concept of creating acrystallization of this fantasy life in everyday situations is somewhatplausible, albeit not so much unless we delve into the world ofpsychosis. Ben seems to first imagine his virtual girlfriend aspersonified after he takes the pill the bullies feed to him (I'massuming it was some sort of amphetamine), shifting the paradigm alongthe lines of substance-induced psychotic disorder, with lingeringeffects up until the end of the film (even though his mother dismissesthe potential severity of the psychic process brewing - after all,psychosis is neurotoxic, so to speak). She is much more concerned withthe overarching social adaptation in a sadistic world than achievingany real resolution to underlying causal issues. Technically, the filmwas visually appealing, the insertion of video game images renderedmore palpable the idea of associative thinking that goes on ineveryone's minds, you don't have to be on the autistic spectrum to fitinto that mold. I didn't love the actor's performance, the build-up wasreasonably OK, I didn't expect the twist, and yet it wasn't terriblyfulfilling nor incredibly realistic that he wouldn't be vilifiedhorrifically (more so) after staging such a farce. Anyway, the bottomline is that the story, in the end, is one of hopelessness, seen as howhe was able to ""win"" the battle against his persecutors, and yet hisego defenses were so clearly feeble, and the external environment sothreatening, that his only choice was to spiral into a psychotic world,so comforting and maladaptive that there may be no way out.",2,Asperger's uber alles,1281657600,"08 13, 2010",2010,2013,"['think', 'concept', 'retreating', 'fantasy', 'life', 'notego-alien', 'most', 'people', 'point', 'one', 'specialabilities', 'much', 'more', 'rigid', 'control', 'what', 'ourlives', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'may', 'echo', 'more', 'true', 'case', 'people', 'who', 'reason', 'have', 'less', 'sophisticated', 'social', 'skills', 'feelthreatened', 'sometimes', 'daunting', 'task', 'adapting', 'thisnihilistic', 'postpostmodern', 'world', 'Now', 'concept', 'creating', 'acrystallization', 'fantasy', 'life', 'everyday', 'situations', 'somewhatplausible', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'delve', 'world', 'ofpsychosis', 'Ben', 'first', 'imagine', 'virtual', 'girlfriend', 'aspersonified', 'pill', 'bullies', 'feed', ""I'massuming"", 'was', 'sort', 'amphetamine', 'shifting', 'paradigm', 'alongthe', 'lines', 'substance-induced', 'psychotic', 'disorder', 'lingeringeffects', 'up', 'end', 'film', 'even', 'mother', 'potential', 'severity', 'psychic', 'process', 'brewing', 'psychosis', 'neurotoxic', 'so', 'speak', 'much', 'more', 'concerned', 'overarching', 'social', 'adaptation', 'sadistic', 'world', 'achievingany', 'real', 'resolution', 'underlying', 'causal', 'issues', 'Technically', 'filmwas', 'visually', 'appealing', 'insertion', 'video', 'game', 'images', 'renderedmore', 'palpable', 'idea', 'associative', 'thinking', 'ineveryone', 'minds', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'autistic', 'spectrum', 'fitinto', 'mold', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'actor', 'performance', 'build-up', 'wasreasonably', 'OK', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'twist', 'yet', 'was', ""n't"", 'terriblyfulfilling', 'incredibly', 'realistic', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'vilifiedhorrifically', 'more', 'so', 'staging', 'such', 'farce', 'Anyway', 'bottomline', 'story', 'end', 'one', 'hopelessness', 'seen', 'howhe', 'was', 'able', 'win', 'battle', 'persecutors', 'yet', 'hisego', 'defenses', 'were', 'so', 'clearly', 'feeble', 'external', 'environment', 'sothreatening', 'only', 'choice', 'was', 'spiral', 'psychotic', 'world', 'comforting', 'maladaptive', 'may', 'be', 'way', 'out']",Ben X
1183709,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B001DYRL22,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[2, 10]","This season, Film Movement international independent movie makers seem to be exploring what it means to be a teenager and different.  What is different about Ben is that he is suffering from Ausberger syndrom.  This is form of autism where person cannot relate to his social surroundings.  Being that high school is painful enough for ""normal"" kids, Ben's hypersensitivity is making him more vulnerable.  His teachers and family, handful of school friends are trying to make it easy on him.  But Ben's only escape from the harsh reality is playing video games.  Ben has built his own reality around the music, video games and his own internal mind.  Interesting exploration of the mind that works differently than most, but not strong enough to convince anyone on how people like Ben make it in the real world as somewhat functioning adults.  Ben is intelligent, physically healthy, just socially inadequate - he has no feelings but can only mimic them from observing others.  What type of profession and independent adult life this leaves for him and people who truly care about him?  These questions remain unanswered, and that is why only two starts for this month's film.",2,Autism,1223942400,"10 14, 2008",2008,1175,"['season', 'Film', 'Movement', 'international', 'independent', 'movie', 'makers', 'seem', 'be', 'exploring', 'what', 'be', 'teenager', 'different', 'What', 'different', 'Ben', 'suffering', 'Ausberger', 'syndrom', 'form', 'autism', 'where', 'person', 'can', 'not', 'relate', 'social', 'surroundings', 'Being', 'high', 'school', 'painful', 'enough', 'normal', 'kids', 'Ben', 'hypersensitivity', 'making', 'more', 'vulnerable', 'teachers', 'family', 'handful', 'school', 'friends', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'easy', 'Ben', 'only', 'escape', 'harsh', 'reality', 'playing', 'video', 'games', 'Ben', 'built', 'own', 'reality', 'music', 'video', 'games', 'own', 'internal', 'mind', 'Interesting', 'exploration', 'mind', 'differently', 'most', 'not', 'strong', 'enough', 'convince', 'anyone', 'how', 'people', 'Ben', 'make', 'real', 'world', 'somewhat', 'functioning', 'adults', 'Ben', 'intelligent', 'physically', 'healthy', 'just', 'socially', 'inadequate', 'feelings', 'can', 'only', 'mimic', 'observing', 'others', 'What', 'type', 'profession', 'independent', 'adult', 'life', 'people', 'who', 'truly', 'care', 'questions', 'remain', 'unanswered', 'why', 'only', 'two', 'starts', 'month', 'film']",Ben X
