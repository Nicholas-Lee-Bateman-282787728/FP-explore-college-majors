Amazon is the only place that sells it and it's dirt cheap so I figured, why not? I am so glad I did. The plot is nothing that special, but I really enjoyed some of the mythology they made up for the show and other well known ideas that they also incorporated into it. I'm also a sucker for Romeo and Juliet type romances that involve vampires, so it's kind of natural that this show would be right up my alley. Although it was obviously made for an early to mid teen audience, I'm in my early 20s and still liked it. The DVD presentation is nothing special, just the first four episodes edited into a 90 minute movie. Six more episodes are scheduled for release in May on two seperate discs.",5,Great short-lived series,1111708800,"03 25, 2005",2005,815,"['absolutely', 'show', 'ordered', 'DVD', 'blind', ""'d"", 'heard', 'show', 'was', 'very', 'interested', 'Amazon', 'only', 'place', 'dirt', 'cheap', 'so', 'figured', 'why', 'not', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'did', 'plot', 'nothing', 'special', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'mythology', 'made', 'up', 'show', 'other', 'well', 'known', 'ideas', 'also', 'incorporated', ""'m"", 'also', 'sucker', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'type', 'romances', 'involve', 'vampires', 'kind', 'natural', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'alley', 'was', 'obviously', 'made', 'early', 'mid', 'teen', 'audience', ""'m"", 'early', '20s', 'still', 'liked', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'nothing', 'special', 'just', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'edited', '90', 'minute', 'movie', 'Six', 'more', 'episodes', 'are', 'scheduled', 'release', 'May', 'two', 'seperate', 'discs']",N/A

There are a lot of breaks which appear to be timed for commercials and it appears to just drag on.  I already had the other two DVDs so I bought this one with the hope that it would somehow complete the story.  It doesn't really complete anything.,4,Vampire High,1341532800,"07 6, 2012",2012,330,"['video', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'two', 'other', 'DVDs', 'were', 'made', 'TV', 'Show', 'are', 'lot', 'breaks', 'appear', 'be', 'timed', 'commercials', 'just', 'drag', 'already', 'had', 'other', 'two', 'DVDs', 'bought', 'one', 'hope', 'would', 'somehow', 'complete', 'story', ""n't"", 'really', 'complete', 'anything']",N/A

The budget's all there, but the plot is really dull - a group of teen vampires is sent to an exclusive school so that they can learn how to 'blend-in' with human society - to stop feeding frenzies so that they don't get caught - so because of this there's very little vampire action - aside from a couple of times they face off against each other baring their fangs.If you're after a film about vampires being vampires - this is not it. If you're after a film about teens being teens - then maybe this is for you - teens who just happen to have fangs.",1,Teen Angst as Vampires,1111708800,"03 25, 2005",2005,582,"['was', 'well', 'produced', 'yawn', 'budget', 'there', 'plot', 'really', 'dull', 'group', 'teen', 'vampires', 'sent', 'exclusive', 'school', 'can', 'learn', 'how', ""'blend-in"", 'human', 'society', 'stop', 'feeding', 'frenzies', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'caught', 'so', 'very', 'little', 'vampire', 'action', 'aside', 'couple', 'times', 'face', 'off', 'other', 'baring', 'fangs.If', ""'re"", 'film', 'vampires', 'being', 'vampires', 'not', ""'re"", 'film', 'teens', 'being', 'teens', 'then', 'maybe', 'teens', 'who', 'just', 'happen', 'have', 'fangs']",N/A
