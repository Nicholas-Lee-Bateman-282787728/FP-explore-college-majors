1524143,A18JORXY0YARAX,B0071LEMQ4,Anne with an e,"[12, 19]","TL:DR version first off:Pros: the narrator is funny, the animation is good and the main guy does have some charmCons: the female lead is vicious, the plot is all over the place, the tone is inconsistent and most of the major plot points are left unresolved.  Also Ryoko beats on Ryoshi like a red headed step child.Ryoko is the Big Bad Wolf and she works for a school club called Otogi Bank that solves people's problems.  For a tough fighter with a hair trigger temper she sure does get kidnapped a lot.  Anyway, while out solving a problem one day she receives a love confession from the socially phobic Ryoshi, who can't stand to have people stare at him.  Hilarity ensues.  Ryoko and her room mate Little Red Riding Hood end up taking Ryoshi into their problem solving team so they can have all sorts of wacky adventures like participating in a beauty pageant, invading enemy high schools and confronting Ryoko's worst enemy.Ryoko is one of those ""strong"" female characters who are tough on the outside but soft on the inside. While the show hints at why she's this way, she's not very well developed over all, and her violent nature does not help in making her sympathetic.  Also, she doesn't grow throughout the show, leaving it the way she came in.  As a result of this, one of the central aspects of the show, her relationship to Ryoshi, doesn't change from episode two through twelve much at all.  While some would say twelve episodes is too short to give a character much development, and admittedly Ryoko's got some huge issues to deal with, this nearly complete lack of change is disappointing and unsatisfying.  Part of that dissatisfaction comes from the fact that though a major figure from her past is the main antagonist, Ryoko herself has little agency in confronting and overcoming him.  Since his motivations are largely tied to her, as well, this is something of a flaw in the story telling and a huge missed opportunity to give Ryoko some much needed character growth.Ryoshi is the wimpiest of wimpy guys, at least at first.  If Ryoko is supposed to be the Bid Bad Wolf, then Ryoshi is the huntsman, what with his stalking abilities and his weapon of choice, a slingshot.  Unlike Ryoko, he actually does develop over the course of the series, and this helps to make him a more sympathetic and interesting character.  While he starts the show with some mad slingshot skills, he also learns to fight and starts to face his phobia of being stared at, in the process becoming more willing to protect those close to him in a proactive way.  His phobia is played for laughs, and it usually works.  Like so very, VERY many anime protagonists before him, he is motivated by a need to protect his lady friend, and often shouts this in battle.  Why he does love her is something of a mystery given how Ryoko's main form of communication with him is a fist to the face. He's in  love with her tsundere charms, I guess, though all he gets is the tsun and non of the dere.  Though his dialogue toward the back half of the show devolves to ""I will protect Ryoko"" he remains a sympathetic and fairly likeable character.As you might expect from a show that specifically mentions seven companions, there are a plethora of minor characters in this show as well.  Ringo (Little Red Riding Hood, what?), Ryoko's room mate and best friend, is the most important of the other Otogi Bank members.  As Ryoko's best friend, room mate and closest confidant, she also serves as Ryoko's humanizing element.  She's cute and childlike, brilliantly intelligent and pretty snarky, and actually pretty likeable, to boot.  She is also the lens through which we see most of Ryoko's character development, which all happens in flashback.The rest of the bank is filled out with assorted character archetypes: the quiet president, the tech geek secretary, the mad scientist, the maid, the lady killer and his sex crazed girlfriend.  Some of them get their own episodes, namely the maid and the sex crazed girl friend.  They're all right but nothing to write home about.  We learn virtually nothing about half of them.There is also a narrator to the story, and let me just say that she gets all the best lines.  A lot of what makes this show watchable is the narrator's monologue, and her continual commentary on the actions and characters in the show.  She also uses a lot of meta humor, with lines like ""in this episode"" and ""this isn't that kind of anime"" and so on.  She wins the show on likeability, and the English VA does a great job.  Pretty impressive for a character we never see.  She does occasionally talk over character dialogue, but I didn't find that too terrible since she generally only talked over arguments.The main bad guy is so generic he's not really even worth mentioning.  A menacing white haired pretty boy, student council president of a rival school.  What makes him menacing to Ryoko is barely touched on, not explored at all.  And I'm not sure what fairy tale he's supposed to be, if any at all.  He's not even the huntsman who always seems to kill the big bad wolf, since that's established to be Ryoshi.The main gimmick of the show are the fairy tale elements, and they are not well done.  In a time where this seems to be a trend, at least in American media, where remade fairy tales are a dime a dozen, and some of them are actually good (like Fables!) I guess there are bound to be a few duds.  The fairy tale elements here are very tacked on, mostly found in store and restaurant names, with a few token characters named after fairy tales.  The Cinderella spoof is the most effectively used fairy tale, and that's taken care of in the very first episode.  Don't expect the tales to have any real effect on story, theme or plot.So what makes this show so boring and bland and disappointing?  There's a lot of good stuff here, honestly, but very little of it is used well.  Instead of building on a couple solid characters and story elements, they overreached and filled this up with too much stuff.  Twelve episodes is not enough time to dig deep into the themes and story elements they set up, especially when they stuffed way too much in there:  Eight characters deemed important with the title.  At least three traumatized childhoods exposed.  School rivalry.  The central romance (that goes no where).  The virtually untapped modern fairy tale groundwork.  All powerful student club.  In other words, WAY too much stuff for twelve episodes.So over all, this was a disappointment, bland, and pretty generic.  Too much is introduced and nothing gets resolved. Half of the main duo is pretty terrible, and the fairy tale elements are underused.  It's just another mildly boring high school anime.",2,"bland, boring and short",1334448000,"04 15, 2012",2012,6715,"['TL', 'DR', 'version', 'first', 'Pros', 'narrator', 'funny', 'animation', 'good',

They will do nearly anything in exchange for a favor that will be determined and asked for later. So there kinda like the mob, or loan sharks. Ryoko and her partner do all sorts of heavy handed stuff for their club. One of the boys in the club is obsessed with Ryoko and will do anything to get her attention. This includes fighting gangs from other high schools.This anime was kind of a let down for me. It is beautifully drawn and has very unique vibe too. The story kind of like a very PG rated Ikki Tousen high school set up crossed with old fables and fairy tales. The animation is probably the best part of this series. It was very similar to Spice and Wolf. There is a lot of fighting in it. I think the character development needed some work to make it great. It had a relatively satisfying ending, but I felt like something was missing.

1524156,ARCD5LEJAQKJL,B0071LEMQ4,"M. White ""diablose""","[2, 2]","This is an anime of a style that has been rare in recent years.  It's a romantic comedy, without a harem.  The story's pretty simple.  Boy likes girl.  Actually the boy is completely devoted to the girl and has no problem being open with his feelings once he gains the courage to actually talk to her.  He does have a problem being the center of attention.  He has a fear of being stared at.  This is a problem because the girl is a fighter and values strength.  A boy that can't even stand to be watched for seconds isn't very appealing.  She's also very closed off from her emotions, so even if she did eventually have feelings for the boy, getting her to admit it, even to herself, would take time.The girl's part of a high school club that does favors for people in return for favors at some future date.  Sometimes these favors require violence to complete.  That's when the girl's boxing skills come to play.  Many of the episodes of this anime are mini stories based on the club's client of the day or to further develop the story of one of the club members.  These are usually just silly or emotionally positive side stories that finish by the end of the episode.  There are a few exceptions and these center around the anime's villain.  Besides that, the only main story line that carries throughout the anime is how the relationship between the boy and girl develops, or doesn't, through the episodes.This is one of the better anime of its style that I've watched.  Though the story is unresolved by the end of the anime, it stops at a point in time where everyone is in a good place.

1524157,A1RO76WBFX9XRJ,B0071LEMQ4,NC,"[39, 44]","It is one of the best short single season shows released within the last few years.The show brings in characters from a variety of fables and stories. The most prominent is Red Riding Hood, The Big Bad Wolf, and the hunter who hunts the wolf. Each character is recreated into a modern day anime counterpart. It's story centers around the Big Bad Wolf, Okami-san. The companions and friends make up a sort of school mafia organization. They take jobs and handle student problems to earn favors which they can then call in later at anytime they want. The school itself is then part of a larger group which owns the city. The concept of a feudal society mixed with mafia tones in how things run, is very prominent.Characters themselves are more akin to generic anime in style and presentation. There is the weak guy, the tough girl, and the schemer...along with all the other common threads like the fan service character/etc. But the interactions of these characters, coming from their fable roots, brings a degree of freshness to the anime that gives it a step above others. Each character has well designed backgrounds and some are very rich. When you recognize who these characters are referencing, you will see new life being breathed into the classic storybook characters.This is a series that will leave you wanting a second season, but for the most part, it does come to a decent stop point at the end. Art style is good and the voices are excellent. The Amazon page lists it currently as Japanese language, but the actors listed and the fact that it is Funimation means it could have an English dub. Hopefully it is a decent dub if there really is one. It is hard to imagine this show done in English. The personalities are so key to characters like Ringo or Okami. Future edit will note this once it is released.Great series, one of the best in recent years. It will cause you to rethink your opinion of the Big Bad Wolf and Red Riding Hood. Enjoy it!

Staff brings top shelf production quality and the character design is fun if a little cliche (a fake loli, perpetual maid, moe mad scientist, super tsundere and a relatively weak-sauce but surprisingly solid male lead).The story follows the members of the Otogi Bank, a mutual help association that does favors for favors - helping people out with certain requests and asking for their help at a later date. It's here that Morino-kun comes on the scene, confessing his affection for Ookami-san, the titular lead. Through a series of adventures the two try working out a troubled but ultimately sweet relationship.The series plays off a number of fairy tales. Ookami-san (wolf) is Akai-san's (red, as in little red riding hood) best friend. Then there is Shirayuki-hime (Snow White) who has seven siblings. And so it goes. It makes for a fun backdrop.One has to hope [POSSIBLE SPOILERS IMMANENT!!!] this is a first installment (though i haven't checked, recently, on plans for another season) as a number of central storylines remain unresolved: Ookami still hasn't told Morino about her past, Shirou is still at large with Rikkun's threat hanging over his head, etc. And ""I don't dislike him"" is hardly sufficient relational development.Overall, the series is enjoyable but not a must see.

But After just going head to by it, I have to save that they did a wonderful job with the dub.The Studio that did the wonderful yet popular series, Toradora, and Shkaugan no shana, has created another story with a fabvled-minded story full of fairy tale tomfoolery, attractive archetypes, allusion to allegories parodies that might capture your heart.The story is about Ryoko Okami as you can say a ""Wolf"" and heroine of the story and along with her Best friend Ringo, also known as Little Red riding hood, are members of Otogi Bank which is also a known as a high school club (Similar to Ouran High school host club if you seen the seires) that helps classmates with their problems Later a boy, comes along thier bank and confesses his love for Ryoko, how rejects him. But joins the Otgi Bank to prove his feelings for love for her, even though he mostly a ""screwup"" but is willing to take a blow to be her ""Sheild.""Each episodes deals with a problem within the request or within the Bank themselves, which in the end learns a lesson. I tell you, I couldn't stop watching this series for a minute. And once again, funimation didn't let me down with the dub, for the cast did a wonderful job.No people have complain this one major issue within this series. Which seems to be the narrator. Luci Christain did the Narrotor and Ringo's mother in this series. But I think she made it more funny and more Fairy tale like, Like she was telling this Fairy tale to a child. And even if you don't like the dub, the Sub as a narrator taking as well, so I don't see why the dub is horrible. I love them both, and I could stand to watch it till the end so If you into this kind of heroine who we could say is a Tsunadere or is Cold to the hero but then lovey dovey later on I would say give this a go. However I might recommend watching the sub or dub on Youtube so you can get he drift.As for the box, it kind like a cardboard but beautiful and cute and the same time. It comes with 4 disk 2 for DVD and 2 for Blu-ray (Each have same artcover on the disk so make sure you look at them first) Except for the cover on the case which has 2 different artworks with Okami-san (One of her Date with ryoshi) and the Other with her new power up costume.There are 12 episodes in all with English and Japanese Audio and subtitles as always.Extras include: Episode Commentaries, Tokyo Intertional Anime Fair, Promotional Video, Commricals for the Enlgish and Japanese Trailers, Textless Songs and Trailers.",5,"Great Series!
