Barral ""NY LuxViewer""","[4, 5]","Although highly inaccurate in the portrayal of the world's most famous castrato, Farinelli is a good introduction to the magical world of Baroque Opera and a visually beautiful film with great costumes and sets.The sets and costumes of the actual representations are great, in good form to the period and one wishes they could have been longer and shown more of the opera productions. The music is absolutely superb and I recommend getting the CD to hear the complete arias. There are plenty of extremely talented countertenors now reviving the part of the castratos all over the world: David Daniels, Dominique Vise and Andreas Scholl to name just a few that come to mind. Derek Lee Ragin was also excellent so I really do not see the need for the voice mix with a soprano, the ONLY choice for a mix, if any,  should have been Ewa Podles, a great alto singer that is also a great baroque technician.The whole plot around Farinelli and Handel is silly. The opera he ""steals"" from him was a very early opera of Handel,(Rinaldo)  which was published by then and he could have bought it at the local music shop. Still, it is interesting from ""the what if"" point of view. Handel was and remains, one of the world's greatest and most talented composers. His operas are particularly beautiful and they have been coming back to the repertory since the 1920's but much more strongly in the past 20 years. ""Xerxes"" ""Agripina"", ""Semele"", ""Flavio"", ""Alcina"". ""Partenope"" and ""Orlando"" have all been revived at the NYCO in recent seasons with excellent productions and sold out houses. Even the stodgy, retrograde MET has staged his ""Rinaldo"" ""Julius Caesar"" and ""Rodelinda"". His stature as one of the finest opera composers of all time is finally been recognized and secured for future generations.Strongly recommended for those interested in the Baroque period, particularly music.",5,Very Important Period Piece,1271808000,"04 21, 2010",2010,1871,"['highly', 'inaccurate', 'portrayal', 'world', 'most', 'famous', 'castrato', 'Farinelli', 'good', 'introduction', 'magical', 'world', 'Baroque', 'Opera', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'film', 'great', 'costumes', 'sets.The', 'sets', 'costumes', 'actual', 'representations', 'are', 'great', 'good', 'form', 'period', 'one', 'wishes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'longer', 'shown', 'more', 'opera', 'productions', 'music', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'recommend', 'getting', 'CD', 'hear', 'complete', 'arias', 'are', 'plenty', 'extremely', 'talented', 'countertenors', 'now', 'reviving', 'part', 'castratos', 'world', 'David', 'Daniels', 'Dominique', 'Vise', 'Andreas', 'Scholl', 'name', 'just', 'few', 'come', 'mind', 'Derek', 'Lee', 'Ragin', 'was', 'also', 'excellent', 'so', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'need', 'voice', 'mix', 'soprano', 'ONLY', 'choice', 'mix', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Ewa', 'Podles', 'great', 'alto', 'singer', 'also', 'great', 'baroque', 'technician.The', 'whole', 'plot', 'Farinelli', 'Handel', 'silly', 'opera', 'steals', 'was', 'very', 'early', 'opera', 'Handel', 'Rinaldo', 'was', 'published', 'then', 'could', 'have', 'bought', 'local', 'music', 'shop', 'Still', 'interesting', 'what', 'point', 'view', 'Handel', 'was', 'one', 'world', 'greatest', 'most', 'talented', 'composers', 'operas', 'are', 'particularly', 'beautiful', 'have', 'been', 'coming', 'back', 'repertory', '1920', 'much', 'more', 'strongly', 'past', '20', 'years', 'Xerxes', 'Agripina', 'Semele', 'Flavio', 'Alcina', 'Partenope', 'Orlando', 'have', 'been', 'revived', 'NYCO', 'recent', 'seasons', 'excellent', 'productions', 'sold', 'out', 'houses', 'Even', 'stodgy', 'retrograde', 'MET', 'staged', 'Rinaldo', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'Rodelinda', 'stature', 'one', 'finest', 'opera', 'composers', 'time', 'finally', 'been', 'recognized', 'secured', 'future', 'generations.Strongly', 'recommended', 'interested', 'Baroque', 'period', 'particularly', 'music']",N/A

551291,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00004TX5F,Ed Uyeshima,"[14, 20]","Something seems strangely amiss with what could have been a fascinating historical glimpse into the world of the castrati (castrated male opera singers) in 18th-century Europe. This 1994 Belgian film is an opulent production full of stunning costumes and set decorations, but director Gerard Corbiau is far more focused on the co-dependency between two real-life brothers, Carlo Broschi, the swoon-worthy castrato known to the world as Farinelli, and his marginally talented composer brother Riccardo. Although there are glimpses of the castration that occurred when Carlo was ten, the narrative deals very little with the psychological anguish of this act, instead showing extravagantly vainglorious scenes of Farinelli's impact on audiences at the time. It's as if the story structure of the Baroque operas written at that time took over the sensibility of the screenplay and trivialized the human complexities into exaggerated melodrama.Despite a valiant effort by Stefano Dionisi in the title role, Farinelli is portrayed as a moody, self-centered egotist rather than a misunderstood artist. Compounding the problem is the fact that his masculine speaking voice is at odds with his ethereal singing voice (obviously a creative decision so as not to alienate the general audience from the character's plight). Moreover, the computerized melding of countertenor Derek Lee Ragin and soprano Ewa Mallas Godlewska into Farinelli's voice simply does not sync up well with Dionisi's lip and throat movements. In other words, you simply don't believe it's Dionisi's voice coming out of him. When the film finally takes flight in the last third of the film, it's because the focus has shifted to the competitive, intense relationship between Farinelli and the great composer of the age, Handel. Jeroen Krabbe - familiar to American audiences for his nasty turn as Barbra Streisand's condescending husband in ""The Prince of Tides"" - plays Handel with such passionate fury that I wish the film was more about his character. This sequence climaxes with the film's musical highlight, a trio of wonderful, truly classic arias from Handel's ""Rinaldo"" - ""Lascia ch'io pianga"", ""Cara sposa, amante cara, dove sei?"" and ""Venti, turbini, prestate le vostre ali a questo pie"".Unfortunately, the remaining musical performances are not nearly as absorbing and rather repetitive. The film again flails toward the end when we are given a rather silly scene involving a solar eclipse and gratuitous nudity with a m&eacute;nage a trois among Farinelli, Riccardo and Alexandra, the woman who is - quite literally - between them. The remaining performances are fine with Enrico LoVerso conveying his Salieri-like inferiority with appropriate fervor, Elsa Zylberstein beguiling as Alexandra and Caroline Cellier doing a fine Jeanne Moreau impersonation as the jaded Margareth Hunter. Overall it's still a relatively disappointing movie saved by Handel's musical genius. Except for a few trailers, there are no extras with the DVD. For those interested in the world of the castrati in more penetrating detail, I suggest reading Anne Rice's 1982 novel, ""Cry to Heaven"", and the ""Rinaldo"" arias are better served by countertenor David Daniels and mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli on their 2002 cast recording conducted by Christopher Hogwood.",3,Fascinating World of Castrati Overshadowed by Brotherly Co-Dependency,1122422400,"07 27, 2005",2005,3311,"['Something', 'strangely', 'amiss', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fascinating', 'historical', 'glimpse', 'world', 'castrati', 'castrated', 'male', 'opera', 'singers', '18th-century', 'Europe', '1994', 'Belgian', 'film', 'opulent', 'production', 'full', 'stunning', 'costumes', 'set', 'decorations', 'director', 'Gerard', 'Corbiau', 'far', 'more', 'focused', 'co-dependency', 'two', 'real-life', 'brothers', 'Carlo', 'Broschi', 'swoon-worthy', 'castrato', 'known', 'world', 'Farinelli', 'marginally', 'talented', 'composer', 'brother', 'Riccardo', 'are', 'glimpses', 'castration', 'occurred', 'when', 'Carlo', 'was', 'ten', 'narrative', 'deals', 'very', 'little', 'psychological', 'anguish', 'act', 'instead', 'showing', 'extravagantly', 'vainglorious', 'scenes', 'Farinelli', 'impact', 'audiences', 'time', 'story', 'structure', 'Baroque', 'operas', 'written', 'time', 'took', 'over', 'sensibility', 'screenplay', 'trivialized', 'human', 'complexities', 'exaggerated', 'valiant', 'effort', 'Stefano', 'Dionisi', 'title', 'role', 'Farinelli', 'portrayed', 'moody', 'self-centered', 'egotist', 'rather', 'misunderstood', 'artist', 'Compounding', 'problem', 'fact', 'masculine', 'speaking', 'voice', 'odds', 'ethereal', 'singing', 'voice', 'obviously', 'creative', 'decision', 'so', 'not', 'alienate', 'general', 'audience', 'character', 'plight', 'Moreover', 'computerized', 'melding', 'countertenor', 'Derek', 'Lee', 'Ragin', 'soprano', 'Ewa', 'Mallas', 'Godlewska', 'Farinelli', 'voice', 'simply', 'not', 'sync', 'up', 'well', 'Dionisi', 'lip', 'throat', 'movements', 'other', 'words', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Dionisi', 'voice', 'coming', 'When', 'film', 'finally', 'flight', 'last', 'third', 'film', 'focus', 'shifted', 'competitive', 'intense', 'relationship', 'Farinelli', 'great', 'composer', 'age', 'Handel', 'Jeroen', 'Krabbe', 'familiar', 'American', 'audiences', 'nasty', 'turn', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'condescending', 'husband', 'Prince', 'Tides', 'Handel', 'such', 'passionate', 'fury', 'wish', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'character', 'sequence', 'climaxes', 'film', 'musical', 'highlight', 'trio', 'wonderful', 'truly', 'classic', 'arias', 'Handel', 'Rinaldo', 'Lascia', ""ch'io"", 'pianga', 'Cara', 'sposa', 'amante', 'cara', 'dove', 'sei', 'Venti', 'turbini', 'prestate', 'le', 'vostre', 'questo', 'pie', '.Unfortunately', 'remaining', 'musical', 'performances', 'are', 'not', 'nearly', 'absorbing', 'rather', 'repetitive', 'film', 'again', 'end', 'when', 'are', 'given', 'rather', 'silly', 'scene', 'involving', 'solar', 'eclipse', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'm', 'eacute', 'trois', 'Farinelli', 'Riccardo', 'Alexandra', 'woman', 'who', 'quite', 'literally', 'remaining', 'performances', 'are', 'fine', 'Enrico', 'LoVerso', 'conveying', 'Salieri-like', 'inferiority', 'appropriate', 'fervor', 'Elsa', 'Zylberstein', 'beguiling', 'Alexandra', 'Caroline', 'Cellier', 'doing', 'fine', 'Jeanne', 'Moreau', 'impersonation', 'jaded', 'Margareth', 'Hunter', 'Overall', 'still', 'relatively', 'disappointing', 'movie', 'saved', 'Handel', 'musical', 'genius', 'few', 'trailers', 'are', 'extras', 'DVD', 'interested', 'world', 'castrati', 'more', 'penetrating', 'detail', 'suggest', 'reading', 'Anne', 'Rice', '1982', 'novel', 'Cry', 'Heaven', 'Rinaldo', 'arias', 'are', 'better', 'served', 'countertenor', 'David', 'Daniels', 'mezzo-soprano', 'Cecilia', 'Bartoli', '2002', 'cast', 'recording', 'conducted', 'Christopher', 'Hogwood']",N/A
551292,A1UBBIDQTDDF79,B00004TX5F,"George Peabody ""Ariel""","[7, 8]","EXPERT FUSING OF TWO VOICES CREATES A SEMI-CASTRATO SOUND!This film is an excellent portrayal of the famous castrati singer 'Carlo Broschi (Farinelli), whose castration occured when he was a young child, and supposedly was his older brother Riccardo's doing; Riccardo being several years older and more or less in charge of his younger brother as both parents were dead.It shows the method of castration often used at that time,but there were many other methods also used.  Carlo wows friends and foes alike with his larger than life stage presence and strong, beautiful singing in 18th century Europe. He sings the mediocre opera compositions of his underachieving older brother Riccardo, who rides the coattails of his more talented and popular younger brother.  Although Riccardo tries to prevent Carlo from going to London (because he knows that once Carlo hears the music of Handel, that would be the end for his mediocre efforts).  And that is exactly what happins.  Carlo begins singing Handel arias and the 2 brothers are separated for many years; Carlo actually throws Riccardo out because he finds out that Riccardo had him castrated!The soundtrack of 'Farinelli', which features the recreation of the castrato voice using a digitally 'morphed' mixture of a counter-tenor (Derek Ragin) with a soprano voice (Ewa Godlewska), was directed by Christophe Rousset, director of Les Talens  Lyriques.  The recreation of the voice of Farinelli, with its superhuman quality was the greatest challange faced by Gerard Corbiau.There is really no accurate existing recording of the great castrati singers.  One cannot classify the disc of the late Alessandro Moreschi, dating from 1902 as a true picture of that glorious voice described by the listener historians of the 18th century.  Thus the fusing of 2 voices to obtain the vocal range of a castrato (three and one-half octaves).  In my opinion, the whole thing comes together very accurately and pleasantly; and has a great mixture of Handel opera arias.",5,a voice teacher and early music fan,1159747200,"10 2, 2006",2006,2007,"['EXPERT', 'FUSING', 'OF', 'TWO', 'VOICES', 'CREATES', 'SEMI-CASTRATO', 'SOUND', 'film', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'famous', 'castrati', 'singer', 'Broschi', 'Farinelli', 'castration', 'occured', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'child', 'supposedly', 'was', 'older', 'brother', 'Riccardo', 'doing', 'Riccardo', 'being', 'several', 'years', 'older', 'more', 'less', 'charge', 'younger', 'brother', 'parents', 'were', 'dead.It', 'method', 'castration', 'often', 'used', 'time', 'were', 'many', 'other', 'methods', 'also', 'used', 'Carlo', 'friends', 'foes', 'alike', 'larger', 'life', 'stage', 'presence', 'strong', 'beautiful', 'singing', '18th', 'century', 'Europe', 'mediocre', 'opera', 'compositions', 'underachieving', 'older', 'brother', 'Riccardo', 'who', 'coattails', 'more', 'talented', 'popular', 'younger', 'brother', 'Riccardo', 'tries', 'prevent', 'Carlo', 'going', 'London', 'once', 'Carlo', 'music', 'Handel', 'would', 'be', 'end', 'mediocre', 'efforts', 'exactly', 'what', 'Carlo', 'singing', 'Handel', 'arias', '2', 'brothers', 'are', 'separated', 'many', 'years', 'Carlo', 'actually', 'Riccardo', 'out', 'out', 'Riccardo', 'had', 'castrated', 'soundtrack', ""'Farinelli"", 'recreation', 'castrato', 'voice', 'using', 'digitally', ""'morphed"", 'mixture', 'counter-tenor', 'Derek', 'Ragin', 'soprano', 'voice', 'Ewa', 'Godlewska', 'was', 'directed', 'Christophe', 'Rousset', 'director', 'Les', 'Talens', 'Lyriques', 'recreation', 'voice', 'Farinelli', 'superhuman', 'quality', 'was', 'greatest', 'challange', 'faced', 'Gerard', 'Corbiau.There', 'really', 'accurate', 'existing', 'recording', 'great', 'castrati', 'singers', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'classify', 'disc', 'late', 'Alessandro', 'Moreschi', 'dating', '1902', 'true', 'picture', 'glorious', 'voice', 'described', 'listener', 'historians', '18th', 'century', 'Thus', 'fusing', '2', 'voices', 'obtain', 'vocal', 'range', 'castrato', 'three', 'one-half', 'octaves', 'opinion', 'whole', 'thing', 'together', 'very', 'accurately', 'pleasantly', 'great', 'mixture', 'Handel', 'opera', 'arias']",N/A

Not much of what goes on the film actually occured.  Also, Riccardo Broschi gets a Salieri-a-la-Amadeus treatment.

551294,AO9764AKXA3JI,B00004TX5F,"Go for Baroque ""Go for Baroque""","[12, 14]","Thank goodness this prize-winning, one-of-a-kind film ""Farinelli"" was made, even though there are many disappointments about it.  It makes a good story about the greatest singer ever; however, the plot has little to do about the real Carlo Broschi.  Some scenes and ideas about him actually are the antithesis of the real man.  I would guess that this story is about 10% Carlo, 10% about other known castrati, 10% about castrati in general, 20% about Baroque opera and that era, and 50% just plain fiction.  As astonishing as Farinelli's voice and career were, he did not have the conflicts and drama film makers believed necessary to make a successful movie; therefore, they made it up.My being a true music lover and also knowledgable about Baroque belle canto, I'm most disappointed in the voices used.  The Sony techs knew how to electronically meld the voices of a countertenor and a female soprano, but obviously they knew little about the belle canto sound, regardless of the fact that there were clues in their own script(!), let along first-hand accounts written by knowledgable people of that time.  Admittedly in 1994, better trained countertenors were only beginning to appear, so the established, average-voice one chosen may have seemed reasonable to the film makers.  In addition, the breathy, warbly, imprecise approach among most female sopranos (along with their distinctly female timbre) had become engrained and accepted by most listeners since the 19th century, so the makers did not sense that this soprano's voice was inappropriate in their attempt to approximate the castrato voice.  If they had been more careful in choosing, they should have insisted that supreme soprano Gundula Janowitz participate in the production.  And for the countertenor, they should have chosen Andreas Scholl.  Regardless of the fact that he was early in his countertenor carreer, he was known for that as well as his earlier experience as a boy soprano.The other musical disappointment is, to keep the movie length shorter, the arias were truncated to 2/5 their original length or less.  This is understandable from a film-maker's view; however, the viewer misses the intent to the Da Capo aria form where the repeated musical theme provides the singer (who in a sense was a ""co-composer"") with the opportunity to ""show his stuff,"" i.e., his acrobatic vocal skills, high notes, and his musical understanding.  The CD soundtrack does have the complete arias and, therefore, is more informative and satisfying.Since this 1994 film was made, interest among music lovers in Baroque vocal works has expanded greatly with many new productions of operas, oratorios, etc., from Handel, Hasse, Bononcini, Mozart, etc.  The Center for the Study of Farinelli has been established in Bologna.

I doubt that a man's ability to ejaculate has much to do with a woman's sexual satisfaction. And the portrayal of the composer George Frideric Handel is just plain ridiculous. When I saw this film in a theater with three friends, the scene where Handel hears Farinelli sing and nearly has a heart attack, with his wig falling off, prompted all four of us to laugh out loud. (In reality, Handel didn't have as high an opinion of Farinelli's singing as some, and chose not to hire him for his own opera troupe.) The film also depicts Farinelli plotting to sing Handel's music by having a maid steal a manuscript from Handel's apartment. The result is Farinelli singing ""Lascia ch'io pianga"" from the opera Rinaldo--which makes no sense at all, since that aria was written for a woman soprano, not an alto castrato, and Farinelli didn't perform travesty roles. Besides, by the time of the incident portrayed, the score of Rinaldo had been published and Farinelli could have simply purchased a copy. The main attraction of this film is the soundtrack. We really have no idea what the castrati sounded like (yes, I know there is a recording of ""the last castrato"" made in 1902, but it's a terribly weak representation of what the great ones must have sounded like), so for the film they concocted a unique voice by digitally combining the sounds of a woman soprano and a male falsettist. The result is dazzling; my recommendation is to buy the soundtrack. The best elements of the film are the beautiful costumes and camera work. The staging of  opera scenes is beautiful enough that you wish they had included complete excerpts, instead of frustratingly brief teases; at least the musical selections are complete on the soundtrack CD.",2,Beautiful But Silly,1175126400,"03 29, 2007",2007,2251,"['Visually', 'opulent', 'stunning', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'foolish', 'liberties', 'story', 'real', 'Farinelli', 'Unfortunately', 'much', 'plot', 'just', 'plain', 'silly', 'Whether', 'not', 'castrato', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'capable', 'sexual', 'relations', 'believed', 'were', 'absurd', 'how', 'film', 'Farinelli', 'would', 'have', 'sex', 'woman', 'then', 'had', 'turn', 'uncastrated', 'brother', 'finish', 'off', 'were', 'doubt', 'man', 'ability', 'ejaculate', 'much', 'do', 'woman', 'sexual', 'satisfaction', 'portrayal', 'composer', 'George', 'Frideric', 'Handel', 'just', 'plain', 'ridiculous', 'When', 'saw', 'film', 'theater', 'three', 'friends', 'scene', 'where', 'Handel', 'Farinelli', 'sing', 'nearly', 'heart', 'attack', 'wig', 'falling', 'off', 'prompted', 'four', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'reality', 'Handel', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'high', 'opinion', 'Farinelli', 'singing', 'chose', 'not', 'hire', 'own', 'opera', 'troupe', 'film', 'also', 'Farinelli', 'plotting', 'sing', 'Handel', 'music', 'having', 'maid', 'steal', 'manuscript', 'Handel', 'apartment', 'result', 'Farinelli', 'singing', 'Lascia', ""ch'io"", 'pianga', 'opera', 'Rinaldo', 'sense', 'aria', 'was', 'written', 'woman', 'soprano', 'not', 'alto', 'castrato', 'Farinelli', 'did', ""n't"", 'perform', 'travesty', 'roles', 'time', 'incident', 'portrayed', 'score', 'Rinaldo', 'had', 'been', 'published', 'Farinelli', 'could', 'have', 'simply', 'purchased', 'copy', 'main', 'attraction', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'really', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'castrati', 'sounded', 'yes', 'know', 'recording', 'last', 'castrato', 'made', '1902', 'terribly', 'weak', 'representation', 'what', 'great', 'ones', 'must', 'have', 'sounded', 'so', 'film', 'concocted', 'unique', 'voice', 'digitally', 'combining', 'sounds', 'woman', 'soprano', 'male', 'falsettist', 'result', 'dazzling', 'recommendation', 'buy', 'soundtrack', 'best', 'elements', 'film', 'are', 'beautiful', 'costumes', 'camera', 'work', 'staging', 'opera', 'scenes', 'beautiful', 'enough', 'wish', 'had', 'included', 'complete', 'excerpts', 'instead', 'frustratingly', 'brief', 'teases', 'least', 'musical', 'selections', 'are', 'complete', 'soundtrack', 'CD']",N/A

FUSCO ""yawnmower""","[17, 19]","Lavish, lusty, imaginative, free-wheeling bio-pic about the life of opera singer Farinelli, one of the great superstars of the 18th century.  The sets and costumes are appropriately extravagant.  The Baroque aesthetic is flamboyantly genuine.  As Carlo and Riccardo Broschi, Stefano Dionisi and Enrico Lo Verso are both darkly beautiful and splendidly sexy.The Church prohibited women from singing in Rome and, in its infinite wisdom, condoned the castration of talented boys to provide treble voices for the Sistine Chapel. Families would send a musical son to a conservatory for this purpose just as they might send another to a seminary for the priesthood.  The great castrati, far from being greeted with the aversion of a modern sensibility, were venerated. Women wept, swooned, fainted at their performances, and they lived lives of great comfort.Born Carlo Broschi, Farinelli was a musical genius with a voice of extraordinary facility, power, and beauty;  his older brother Riccardo is portrayed here as a second-rate composer whose notoriety is entirely dependent upon the genius of his younger brother.  This is just one of the historical facts that have been altered or exaggerated for the sake of dramatic effect.Riccardo was a successful, if minor, composer.  Their brotherly disputes were the subject of much gossip, but not for the reason promulgated in the film.  Carlo took his stage name to honor a benefactor named Farina.  He was reportedly not much interested in sex, but many castrati were highly sensual as Farinelli is depicted in the film.  He never sang for Handel but the composer was a jovial man and treated musicians with respect.  The decision to portray him as an ogre is the film's greatest, and most unnecessary, distortion.The star of the film, ultimately, is the resplendent music.  The voice of Farinelli (miraculously synthesized from a soprano and a counter-tenor) is glorious.  The performances are joyously Baroque.  And, considering the extraordinary beauty of Stefano Dionisi and Enrico Lo Verso, it is a luxurious feast for eyes as well as the ears.",5,baroque slice of life,1173312000,"03 8, 2007",2007,2093,"['Lavish', 'lusty', 'imaginative', 'free-wheeling', 'bio-pic', 'life', 'opera', 'singer', 'Farinelli', 'one', 'great', 'superstars', '18th', 'century', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'appropriately', 'extravagant', 'Baroque', 'aesthetic', 'flamboyantly', 'genuine', 'Carlo', 'Riccardo', 'Broschi', 'Stefano', 'Dionisi', 'Enrico', 'Lo', 'Verso', 'are', 'darkly', 'beautiful', 'splendidly', 'sexy.The', 'Church', 'prohibited', 'women', 'singing', 'Rome', 'infinite', 'wisdom', 'condoned', 'castration', 'talented', 'boys', 'provide', 'treble', 'voices', 'Sistine', 'Chapel', 'Families', 'would', 'send', 'musical', 'son', 'conservatory', 'purpose', 'just', 'might', 'send', 'seminary', 'priesthood', 'great', 'castrati', 'far', 'being', 'greeted', 'aversion', 'modern', 'sensibility', 'were', 'venerated', 'Women', 'wept', 'swooned', 'fainted', 'performances', 'lived', 'lives', 'great', 'comfort.Born', 'Carlo', 'Broschi', 'Farinelli', 'was', 'musical', 'genius', 'voice', 'extraordinary', 'facility', 'power', 'beauty', 'older', 'brother', 'Riccardo', 'portrayed', 'here', 'second-rate', 'composer', 'notoriety', 'entirely', 'dependent', 'genius', 'younger', 'brother', 'just', 'one', 'historical', 'facts', 'have', 'been', 'altered', 'exaggerated', 'sake', 'dramatic', 'effect.Riccardo', 'was', 'successful', 'minor', 'composer', 'brotherly', 'disputes', 'were', 'subject', 'much', 'gossip', 'not', 'reason', 'promulgated', 'film', 'Carlo', 'took', 'stage', 'name', 'honor', 'benefactor', 'named', 'Farina', 'was', 'reportedly', 'not', 'much', 'interested', 'sex', 'many', 'castrati', 'were', 'highly', 'sensual', 'Farinelli', 'depicted', 'film', 'never', 'sang', 'Handel', 'composer', 'was', 'jovial', 'man', 'treated', 'musicians', 'respect', 'decision', 'portray', 'ogre', 'film', 'greatest', 'most', 'unnecessary', 'distortion.The', 'star', 'film', 'ultimately', 'resplendent', 'music', 'voice', 'Farinelli', 'miraculously', 'synthesized', 'soprano', 'counter-tenor', 'glorious', 'performances', 'are', 'joyously', 'Baroque', 'considering', 'extraordinary', 'beauty', 'Stefano', 'Dionisi', 'Enrico', 'Lo', 'Verso', 'luxurious', 'feast', 'eyes', 'as', 'well', 'ears']",N/A

I was fascinated by it, and my daughter, a serious singing student, saw (non-racy) portions of it in her French school.  It is a very European film, paying minute attention to historical (if not biographical) detail.  It is also a taut drama between two brother, one a performer of genius (truly a rock star of his age) and the other a hanger-on who uses his brother to advance an otherwise mediocre talent.  Hamdel is also fun, but I never appreciated him all that much.At the core of the drama is a terrible secret, of course.  The brothers are very close, sharing lovers and their music, and their love for each other is lost eventually.  While this is not biographically anything we can know, it is great drama that never becomes soap opera.You see popular culture for aristocrats of the time, which is a real treat.

There are also subtitles in French and Spanish, as well as scene selections. French director Gerard Corbiau decided to make a lush film about the life of Farinelli, the greatest castrato singer in all history, portrayed by Italian actor Stefano Dionisi. On DVD, this film looks exquisite. It's a film of adult material (nudity and sex) and for specialized interests. Opera buffs will want to take a glimpse back to the early days of Baroque Opera when the castrati were the music idols of their day, enjoying rockstar status and great wealth. Everything about this film is really engaging to look at. The authentic historic costumes and the precise European locations provide the film with an immediacy and virtual historic escape. We are there in 17th century Italy following this dramatically heightened take on the career of Farinelli. Stefano Dionisi does a great performance, though his effiminate looks, mischief and diva temperament reveals something of a homosexual but this notion is taken into question when we see him in the love scenes with the many beautiful women that are his groupies and loyal admirers of his voice.This drama may not be entirely true. The story of how the two brothers who are at conflict (one brother reaps the benefits the other is left frustrated and obscure) may be a deliberate attempt to resemble Milos Forman's Amadeus.Farinelli came from a family of musical ambitions and when he was about to hit puberty he wanted to be castrated for the sole purpose of making millions of money and acquiring world fame as a singer. Castrating male youth so as to keep their high-pitched soprano range was an Italian custom, which died out in the 18th century where women began to enjoy more prominet roles in opera, such as the operas of Mozart. Farinelli was the greatest castrato singer of his day. He was incredibly rich and enjoyed the company of royalty. After his many theatrical performances in operas by Handel and other composers, he gave up the stage to sing in the private chambers of Spanish King Phillip V. He lived in luxury there for the rest of his life.The film is exotic and beautiful to look at and to listen. The music of Handel is prominent, since it was Handel who most wrote for the castrati voice. Impressive are the scenes at the opera, where Farinelli dazzles and mesmerizes his audience against the colorful and elaborate Baroque stage sets. In one scene early in the film, he sings what looks like the sun god Apollo, in a feathered helmet, and is briefly interrupted by a young lady's turning the pages to a libretto. He continues his singing and finishes with an elongated note that is impossible to hold for any tenor or soprano nowadays. Today, the castrati vocal sound is extinct. Perhaps close to it, and even this by a little off, is the male countertenor or a highly developed falsetto. I find that the female mezzo soprano voice is the closest to castrati singing, especially Cecilia Bartoli. Her singing in the recent Salieri Album comes dangerously close to sounding like castrati.In the movie, creative editing and synthesizing combined a tenor's lung power and a soprano's high top register to effectively portray the sound of a castrati, which sounded like a weird blend of male and female voices, with the female being the stronger range. With that voice, coloratura is unleashed with freedom, agility and high-flung acrobatics.",5,The Exotic History Of Opera: Farinelli The Great,1084406400,"05 13, 2004",2004,3494,"['DVD', 'equipped', 'English', 'translation', 'Italian', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'are', 'also', 'subtitles', 'French', 'Spanish', 'as', 'well', 'scene', 'selections', 'French', 'director', 'Gerard', 'Corbiau', 'decided', 'make', 'lush', 'film', 'life', 'Farinelli', 'greatest', 'castrato', 'singer', 'history', 'portrayed', 'Italian', 'actor', 'Stefano', 'Dionisi', 'DVD', 'film', 'exquisite', 'film', 'adult', 'material', 'nudity', 'sex', 'specialized', 'interests', 'Opera', 'buffs', 'will', 'want', 'take', 'glimpse', 'back', 'early', 'days', 'Baroque', 'Opera', 'when', 'castrati', 'were', 'music', 'idols', 'day', 'enjoying', 'rockstar', 'status', 'great', 'wealth', 'Everything', 'film', 'really', 'engaging', 'look', 'authentic', 'historic', 'costumes', 'precise', 'European', 'locations', 'provide', 'film', 'immediacy', 'virtual', 'historic', 'escape', 'are', 'there', '17th', 'century', 'Italy', 'following', 'dramatically', 'heightened', 'take', 'career', 'Farinelli', 'Stefano', 'Dionisi', 'great', 'performance', 'effiminate', 'looks', 'mischief', 'diva', 'temperament', 'reveals', 'something', 'homosexual', 'notion', 'taken', 'question', 'when', 'see', 'love', 'scenes', 'many', 'beautiful', 'women', 'are', 'groupies', 'loyal', 'admirers', 'voice.This', 'drama', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'entirely', 'true', 'story', 'how', 'two', 'brothers', 'who', 'are', 'conflict', 'one', 'brother', 'benefits', 'other', 'left', 'frustrated', 'obscure', 'may', 'be', 'deliberate', 'attempt', 'resemble', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'Amadeus.Farinelli', 'came', 'family', 'musical', 'ambitions', 'when', 'was', 'hit', 'puberty', 'wanted', 'be', 'castrated', 'sole', 'purpose', 'making', 'millions', 'money', 'acquiring', 'world', 'fame', 'singer', 'Castrating', 'male', 'youth', 'so', 'keep', 'high-pitched', 'soprano', 'range', 'was', 'Italian', 'custom', 'died', 'out', '18th', 'century', 'where', 'women', 'began', 'enjoy', 'more', 'prominet', 'roles', 'opera', 'such', 'operas', 'Mozart', 'Farinelli', 'was', 'greatest', 'castrato', 'singer', 'day', 'was', 'incredibly', 'rich', 'enjoyed', 'company', 'royalty', 'many', 'theatrical', 'performances', 'operas', 'Handel', 'other', 'composers', 'gave', 'up', 'stage', 'sing', 'private', 'chambers', 'Spanish', 'King', 'Phillip', 'V.', 'lived', 'luxury', 'rest', 'life.The', 'film', 'exotic', 'beautiful', 'look', 'listen', 'music', 'Handel', 'prominent', 'was', 'Handel', 'who', 'most', 'wrote', 'castrati', 'voice', 'Impressive', 'are', 'scenes', 'opera', 'where', 'Farinelli', 'dazzles', 'mesmerizes', 'audience', 'colorful', 'elaborate', 'Baroque', 'stage', 'sets', 'one', 'scene', 'early', 'film', 'what', 'sun', 'god', 'Apollo', 'feathered', 'helmet', 'briefly', 'interrupted', 'young', 'lady', 'turning', 'pages', 'libretto', 'singing', 'finishes', 'elongated', 'note', 'impossible', 'hold', 'tenor', 'soprano', 'nowadays', 'Today', 'castrati', 'vocal', 'sound', 'extinct', 'Perhaps', 'close', 'even', 'little', 'off', 'male', 'countertenor', 'highly', 'developed', 'falsetto', 'find', 'female', 'mezzo', 'soprano', 'voice', 'closest', 'castrati', 'singing', 'especially', 'Cecilia', 'Bartoli', 'singing', 'recent', 'Salieri', 'Album', 'dangerously', 'close', 'sounding', 'castrati.In', 'movie', 'creative', 'editing', 'synthesizing', 'combined', 'tenor', 'lung', 'power', 'soprano', 'high', 'top', 'register', 'effectively', 'portray', 'sound', 'castrati', 'sounded', 'weird', 'blend', 'male', 'female', 'voices', 'female', 'being', 'stronger', 'range', 'voice', 'coloratura', 'unleashed', 'freedom', 'agility', 'high-flung', 'acrobatics']",N/A
551301,ALN0TTRTLHA4E,B00004TX5F,"Tom Munro ""tomfrombrunswick""","[8, 26]","This was in a technical sense an interesting film. As everyone would know this film is about a castratii. A singer who has had his testicles cut off before puberty to preserve a boys voice. The sort of voice which was achieved by these singers is now something of a problem and the parts are sung by women. In an attempt to reproduce the sort of sound that would have occured two singers, a man and woman have tracks morphed by a computer. The sound is fascinating. The movie however is not.The hero Farinelli apart from being one of Europes leading singers became a companion of the king of Spain in later life. He would thus have seemed to be a person of some interlect and charm.The film however is pretty grotesque. It makes his castration the center point of the film and the basis of the entire tension and plot direction. Whilst such an operation would clearly be a bit of a shock, we would probably see it as so. For Farinelli it would not doubt be different. It was a decision which moved him from a person with no future to wealth and a place in a royal court. Of course nowdays we tend to see sexual matters as more important and the film reflects this rather modern attitude with the theme being his sense of loss and betrayal. It is his brother who has drugged and castrated him at a young age and then makes a living off him by managing him.Despite a modern view of things being cast back on a far different time, the film is quite grotesque. Thus Farinelli's brother uses him to get girls ""in the mood"" and as they lie in bed sexually excited he comes in to finish the job his brother cannot do. Again something which is the creation of the film director to explain the co-dependance of the brothers and the shame and hostility of Farinelli.In general the film is a dissapointment. The portrayal of the characters such as Handel is absurd. The tensions and drama within the film are contrived. The singing is however good.
