746731,A3TOWO3PUY3DGL,B00008R9KF,-Ashi-,"[7, 9]","I suppose people either love this film or hate it....The basic plot was a guy trying to do something in his life in a somewhat confusing world, were everything was not to his advantage.  Omar, a son of Pakistani immigrant, who up until the start of the movie, didn't have any direction in life.  We don't know about his history, but it'll unfold later in the movie.  We learned he is gay, and was a troublemaker when he was younger.Anyways..., I suppose some people don't like how this movie rambles.  I for one, hate it when I sense the author of a book (or in this case, filmmaker) can't seem to make up his/her mind.  I don't think in this movie the direction is lost (it actually works for some odd reason).  The movie is sort of a snapshot of life going through a phase.  This is realism.  I suppose it won't satisfy people who like a grand plot that's meticulously devised.Also keep in mind the movie was from the 80's when most movies' plots were thin like paper.  There are some dialogues that don't connect too well.  In general though, it's pretty good if you put the era into perspective.Memorable characters....  This is a very difficult thing to do in a movie or a book.  I like how real the characters seem to be.  Not fake, not exaggerated malevolent or divinely benign.  They have their own self interests.  There is few political agenda in characters' dialogue (e.g., let's beautify gay people, or let's do an anti-discrimination theme).  No, they are just real people.  They don't speak words directly to the audience and feed us ideas.  They earn out affection by being themselves, not ""I am gay and Pakistani, so you owe me something.""  If you want melodrama, look elsewhere.  (And people say I am melodramatic... ;-))I love the ending; very cute and affectionate.  Leave an imprint on me without shock value or sensual eroticism.  You'd think after Johnny (Daniel Day-Lewis) got beaten up, you'd hear some grunt about life and injustice in general.  No..., we are rewarded with a scene where Omar tried to clean Johnny's wound and they ended up not ""I'm sorry, but let's have sex"" but two guys, very innocently splash water at each other.  That's VERY original (though I sensed Day-Lewis was about to take his pants off...).  I challenge you to write a scene like that.Life moves on, you know.  I am happy the movie doesn't give a self-pity, wound-licking ending.  (I apologize for being so unprofessional in this review.

746736,A1G56KHOUOFWDW,B00008R9KF,"Dianne Foster ""Di""","[56, 62]","I love MY BEAUTIFUL LAUNDERETTE. I saw it ages ago in a local art house, and have never forgotten some of the scenes and the dialogue or the story line. The tale was written by a young Asian playwright of English birth and is somewhat autobiographical. It is a coming of age and love story rolled into one. Although the film is jam-packed with fine Asian actors, some of whom have very familiar faces, the most memorable character from my perspective is &quot;Johnny&quot; played by Daniel Day Lewis.Johnny bears a strong resemblance to various young EAST ENDERS, to Sid Vicious as portrayed by Gary Oldman in the film SID AND NANCY (physical build and demeanor, Johnny isn't as violent), and some of the youths in various Mike Leigh films. If you see this film along with other DDL films such as MY LEFT FOOT, LAST OF THE MOHICANS, THE BOXER, THE AGE OF INNOCENCE, THE CRUCIBLE, and THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING, you will realize why Daniel Day Lewis is the greatest living actor in the Enlish-speaking world. When LAUNDERETTE becomes available I plan to add it to my nearly complete collection of DDL films. DDL was very young when he made this film--near the time he made THE BOUNTY in which he plays Mr. Frye, and ROOM WITH A VIEW in which he plays Cecil. He's just incredible.At the beginning of the tale, Johnny like many of his English friends is semi-hostile toward the Pakistani settlers in London.  He feels they are somehow implicated in his predicament which is to be an unemployed school dropout with no future in Margaret Thatcher's England. Johnny offends the Asians with anti-immigrant behaviour--marching in a &quot;parade&quot; through the Asian sector of town to protest the presence of the Pakistanis in England.Some time later Johnny and the young Pakistani boy who is the protagonist of LAUNDERETTE (undoubtedly the author) become reacquainted. The young man is attempting to become independent from his overbearing relatives and establish himself as a London businessman by opening a launderette. He succeds, and manages to open his launderette, and he hires Johnny as his assistant. Soon Johnny becomes more than an employee, he becomes a lover. Obviously, given that the Asian boy's family would prefer that he retain his culture and allow them to arrange a marriage Johnny is a problem. They had not imagined their son and nephew would link up with Johnny--the lower class skinhead who is white and homosexual. Many awkward and funny moments ensue.The film is filled with humor, strife, growing up, ties of family, racism, religion, homoerotic love, and the struggle to become acculturated in a new society. The DVD is worth the price just to see Daniel Day Lewis with a peroxide blonde crewcut, his head covered with a baseball cap, his mouth filled with chewing gum, and naked. He is priceless.",5,Coming of age...,991353600,"06 1, 2001",2001,2827,"['love', 'MY', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'LAUNDERETTE', 'saw', 'ago', 'local', 'art', 'house', 'have', 'never', 'forgotten', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'story', 'line', 'tale', 'was', 'written', 'young', 'Asian', 'playwright', 'English', 'birth', 'somewhat', 'autobiographical', 'coming', 'age', 'love', 'story', 'rolled', 'one', 'film', 'jam-packed', 'fine', 'Asian', 'actors', 'whom', 'have', 'very', 'familiar', 'most', 'memorable', 'character', 'perspective', 'quot', 'Johnny', 'quot', 'played', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis.Johnny', 'strong', 'resemblance', 'various', 'young', 'EAST', 'ENDERS', 'Sid', 'Vicious', 'portrayed', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'film', 'SID', 'AND', 'NANCY', 'physical', 'build', 'demeanor', 'Johnny', ""n't"", 'violent', 'youths', 'various', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'films', 'see', 'film', 'other', 'DDL', 'films', 'such', 'MY', 'LEFT', 'FOOT', 'LAST', 'THE', 'MOHICANS', 'THE', 'BOXER', 'THE', 'AGE', 'OF', 'INNOCENCE', 'THE', 'CRUCIBLE', 'THE', 'UNBEARABLE', 'LIGHTNESS', 'OF', 'BEING', 'will', 'realize', 'why', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'greatest', 'living', 'actor', 'Enlish-speaking', 'world', 'When', 'LAUNDERETTE', 'available', 'plan', 'add', 'nearly', 'complete', 'collection', 'DDL', 'films', 'DDL', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'when', 'made', 'film', 'time', 'made', 'THE', 'BOUNTY', 'Mr.', 'Frye', 'ROOM', 'WITH', 'A', 'VIEW', 'Cecil', 'just', 'incredible.At', 'beginning', 'tale', 'Johnny', 'many', 'English', 'friends', 'semi-hostile', 'Pakistani', 'settlers', 'London', 'are', 'somehow', 'implicated', 'predicament', 'be', 'unemployed', 'school', 'dropout', 'future', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'England', 'Johnny', 'Asians', 'anti-immigrant', 'behaviour', 'marching', 'quot', 'quot', 'Asian', 'sector', 'town', 'protest', 'presence', 'Pakistanis', 'England.Some', 'time', 'later', 'Johnny', 'young', 'Pakistani', 'boy', 'who', 'protagonist', 'LAUNDERETTE', 'undoubtedly', 'author', 'become', 'reacquainted', 'young', 'man', 'attempting', 'become', 'independent', 'overbearing', 'relatives', 'establish', 'London', 'businessman', 'opening', 'launderette', 'manages', 'open', 'launderette', 'Johnny', 'assistant', 'Soon', 'Johnny', 'more', 'employee', 'lover', 'Obviously', 'given', 'Asian', 'boy', 'family', 'would', 'prefer', 'retain', 'culture', 'allow', 'arrange', 'marriage', 'Johnny', 'problem', 'had', 'not', 'imagined', 'son', 'nephew', 'would', 'link', 'up', 'Johnny', 'lower', 'class', 'skinhead', 'who', 'white', 'homosexual', 'Many', 'awkward', 'funny', 'moments', 'ensue.The', 'film', 'filled', 'humor', 'strife', 'growing', 'up', 'ties', 'family', 'racism', 'religion', 'homoerotic', 'love', 'struggle', 'become', 'acculturated', 'new', 'society', 'DVD', 'price', 'just', 'see', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'peroxide', 'blonde', 'crewcut', 'head', 'covered', 'baseball', 'cap', 'mouth', 'filled', 'chewing', 'gum', 'naked', 'priceless']",My Beautiful Laundrette

746743,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00008R9KF,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 5]","My Beautiful Laundrette is directed by Stephen Frears, the director behind one of my favorite films (Dangerous Liaisons) and several other good ones (High Fidelity, Mary Reilly, and The Queen to name a few). The film features an Oscar-nominated script by Hanif Kureishi and an early, stand-out performance by two-time Academy Award winner Daniel Day-Lewis (Best Actor, My Left Foot & There Will Be Blood).The setting is a racially-tense neighborhood in Thatcher-ear London. Omar (Gordon Warnecke) is a young Pakistani who starts working for his uncle washing cars. Omar is soon allowed to run his uncle's shabby, run-down laundrette. It's around this time that Omar encounters childhood friend Johnny (Day-Lewis), a hood who runs with a small group of fascists who enjoy provoking racial violence. Omar hires Johnny to help up him fix up the laundrette with drug money he has stolen from his uncle's associate Salim.It is soon revealed that Omar and Johnny are gay...And Salim discovers where his drugs went and Omar opens more laundrettes. None of these things will surprise you. They weren't meant to admittedly, but what this entire film seems to be is a rather complicated story told as a standard in a 94-minute timeframe.The film's script follows a very linear plot. This, juxtaposed with the unnecessary changes in tone, makes the screenplay the weakest element of the film. It's a film that wants to explore themes of social and ethnic classes, as well as sexuality, but it never really says much on the subject. As if Kureishi knew these were important issues but didn't know why. It doesn't work as an exploration of these subjects and it's a rather complex story that had been formatted into a much more simplistic one. It made me question what exactly the screenwriter's intention was.Beyond that, it's not particularly well-made. It has very dated near-grainy cinematography and some synthesizer music used as the score, which seems inappropriate in some of the scenes. Many films directed by Frears seem very dated due largely in part to his use of cinematography. ""Mary Reilly"" looks and feels much older than 1996 (this has nothing to do with its timeframe) and ""The Queen"" looks to glossy and done-up (another Miramax film called ""Casanova"" suffered the same problem).If anything, I can see My Beautiful Laundrette causing a stir in 1985 when it was released especially with its depiction of Omar and Johnny's homosexual relationship. This brings me to my next subject...This is not a gay-themed movie such as Brokeback Mountain. While ""Brokeback"" has a central theme of homosexuality and its very plot relies on it, My Beautiful Laundrette does not. It is not about two homosexual men but rather, two men who happen to be homosexual. If all the scenes of Omar and Johnny being intimate were removed from the film, it would have little or no effect on the overall story.The best, most consistent thing about the film is the subtle, moving performance of Daniel Day-Lewis. This is not Bill the Butcher or Daniel Plainview; this is Day-Lewis in neutral. It's a performance that shows off his range as an actor and his ability to completely immerse himself in a role, big or small. He's one of the few well-known actors who walk on-screen and allow you to instantly identify the character rather than the actor. I can imagine Day-Lewis viewing that as a compliment of the highest order.My Beautiful Laundrette is not a powerful, profound, or particularly moving film.

I was in the cinema tonight, watching this movie at the Gay & Lesbian film festival with my boyfriend and two friends, and this was WITHOUT EXCEPTION THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN! Why? For the following reasons:1. The STORY - or lack of same - is HORRIBLE. Not just bad, but horrible. Someone should have told the author that when you write a story you need to: a) Have something on your mind that you want to tell the reader/receiver; b) have a red line in the movie that connects the scenes, persons and events; and c) reach a conclusion in the end of the story. Unfortunately, story has neither. The events are totally rambled up, the focus seems to be moved at least a dozens of times during the (all to long) length of the movie, sudden events come without any purpose, explanation or, worst of all, point.2. The ACTING is INCREDIBLY LOUSY. Nothing really more to be said. Daniell Day Lewis looks nice, but the acting is just so incredibly amateur-like that I couldn't believe it.3. The DIALOGUE is Awful. There was one - ONE - line in the wholemovie that actually worked (when the uncle says ""I'm a professional businessman, not a professional Pakisthani."" The rest just screams 'I'm an 11 year old trying to write a screenplay'.4. The CUTTING is - I'm running out of bad words hear, so I'll just stick to horrible, cause that pretty much sums it up. When the cutting is done well you won't really notice it, but in this movie the cutting is done in all the wrong places - either too soon or too late.On the bottom line, you might think: There might be some redeeming qualities, there must be something good to say about this movie. But there's not. Sorry. But I have nothing good to say. It just downright horrible. And no, I'm not homophobic since I'm gay, so pleasy don't bring that one up.1 out of 5. That's a minimum.

746745,A1OBJ2263JCK5,B00008R9KF,Kenneth M. Gelwasser,"[11, 11]","I've been waiting a very long time to be able to add Stephen Frears' wonderful, independent film ""My Beautiful Laundrette"" to my DVD collection. I'm overjoyed to once again view this well written, 'slice of life' comedy/drama. The movie casts a sharp and critical, socio-political, eye on Margret Thatcher's England of the 1980's.In the film we meet Omar (Gordon Warnecke) a young man, who is a poor relation to a wealthy Pakistani family, living in England.Omar's rather  unscrupulous, Uncle (Saeed Jaffrey)decides to do him a favor and take him into the family business.He allows Omar to make a go of an old, broken down, laundrette, which is blithley described as a ""toilet"".At first Omar seems quiet, polite and attenative. But as the film goes on we find out, that he is quite a character. He isn't one to just push a broom around and watch the laundrette fail.He has big dreams for both the establishment and his financial future.Omar enlists the help of his white, working class, pal and gay lover, Johnny (brilliantly played by a young, Daniel Day-Lewis)to make the future happen now.Together the two craftily (and illegally) finance and fix up, what can only be described as the 'Disneyland' of Laundrettes.Director,Stephen Frear's movie humoursly presents Omar's speedy rise into the business world.But it is also rather melancholic in tone and touches on a variety of serious subjects, which includes everything from politics to race relations to economic policy. The cast of the movie is fantastic and the standouts include Saeed Jaffrey as Omar's amoral, Uncle Nasser and Roshan Seth as his socialist, alcholic father. Daniel Day-Lewis is superb in his star making, nuanced performance as a gay, working class, tough guy.The DVD remaster of the film is adequate, but has little in extras. It is a movie that is just begging for a director's commentary!""My Beautiful Laundrette"" is a wonderfully entertaining film, which leaves the viewer with plenty to think about.

But he wants to be more like his wealthy Uncle Nasar.  Uncle gives him a start by offering him a job to manage a Laundromat.  But this Laundromat is a dump and there is a string attached, Omar must date his cousin.To make some extra money, Omar delivers drugs for another cousin. Omar decides to spruce the Laundromat up and enlists his friend Johnny (DDL).  Johnny comes up with an idea of skimming some of the drugs to fund the upgrades.  They reopen the luxury Laundromat and it is a hit.The problem with dating his cousin is that Omar is in love with someone else, Johnny.  This is deftly handled and it hits you from the blindside.This film is great from many different directions.

His father is a brilliant, well educated socialist who was famous back home but is a nobody there, so he has taken to his bed with a bottle of vodka.  His hope is in Omar, and he expects him to go to college to understand the evils of society. Meanwhile, though they need cash and he calls on his successful  brother, Nassar to give Omar a summer job in one of his many businesses.We watch Omar as he gains favor with Nassar and gets to manage one of his run down laundrettes in a poor area of the city.  He wants to follow in his uncle's footsteps and make a lot of money.  The plot thickens as he runs into an old childhood friend, Johnny, a lower class native Brit who has turned into a petty criminal and hangs out with a group of racist skinhead types.  We follow Omar as he deals with the various personalities in the extended family, including a female cousin who has her eye on him.Omar persuades Johnny to help him turn the laundrette into something spectacular and the project gives the film its center.  We see squalor turned into beauty as the two boys realize their dream and meanwhile we see them fall in love with each other. It's not a simple success story, though, and they have to contend with enemies in both groups--the Pakistani family and the skinheads.There is so much richness in this small, unpretentious, made for TV film...themes of class distinction, political views, sexuality, roles of women as well as race.  The film just tells the story without preaching at us.  I found myself rooting for each of them, at one time or another, with the exception of the totally vile Salim.  The acting is terrific and Daniel Day Lewis will grab your heart. And even though there is plenty to worry us as the plot unfolds, I found myself feeling good at the end.
