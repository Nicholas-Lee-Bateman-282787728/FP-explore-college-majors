1001521,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B000GBK52G,Andres C. Salama,"[3, 5]","After Nine Queens, a good but perhaps somewhat overrated thriller involving con games related to some rare stamps, director Fabian Bielinski followed up with The Aura. The film involves an epileptic taxidermist (?), played by Ricardo Darin (a famous Argentine actor, who also starred in Nine Queens) who, by some improbable chances and coincidences, gets involved with a gang in a casino heist in the picturesque Patagonian Andes of Southern Argentina. The plot is not very believable: Bielinski's sources for his films are not real life, but genre films filtered through some heavy and dubious philosophizing. This is not bad in itself; directors like Fuller, Melville and John Woo made some fine films out of pulp material, but Bielinski, who died of a heart attack soon after Aura was released in Argentina, was unfortunately not on their league. His two films show him as a competent genre filmmaker, but neither of those rise up to what can be considered a great film, in my opinion.",2,Somewhat disappointing follow up to Nine Queens,1201046400,"01 23, 2008",2008,988,"['Nine', 'Queens', 'good', 'perhaps', 'somewhat', 'overrated', 'thriller', 'involving', 'con', 'games', 'related', 'rare', 'stamps', 'director', 'Fabian', 'Bielinski', 'followed', 'up', 'Aura', 'film', 'epileptic', 'taxidermist', 'played', 'Ricardo', 'Darin', 'famous', 'Argentine', 'actor', 'who', 'also', 'starred', 'Nine', 'Queens', 'who', 'improbable', 'chances', 'coincidences', 'involved', 'gang', 'casino', 'heist', 'picturesque', 'Patagonian', 'Andes', 'Southern', 'Argentina', 'plot', 'not', 'very', 'believable', 'Bielinski', 'sources', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'real', 'life', 'genre', 'films', 'filtered', 'heavy', 'dubious', 'philosophizing', 'not', 'bad', 'directors', 'Fuller', 'Melville', 'John', 'Woo', 'made', 'fine', 'films', 'pulp', 'material', 'Bielinski', 'who', 'died', 'heart', 'attack', 'soon', 'Aura', 'was', 'released', 'Argentina', 'was', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'league', 'two', 'films', 'show', 'competent', 'genre', 'filmmaker', 'rise', 'up', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'great', 'film', 'opinion']",N/A
1001522,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B000GBK52G,Andy Orrock,"[3, 3]","I second the guidance I see expressed here in one of the spotlight reviews: don't be put off by the cover image, which represents a very quick passage in the film.  Though the fear in 'The Aura' is palpable and threat of death becomes more of a possibility as writer/director Fabi&aacute;n Bielinsky expertly ratchets up the tension, the take of this intelligent movie is for the viewer to imagine the possible consequences.If you enjoyed Bielinsky teaming with the great Ricardo Dar&iacute;n (El Secreto De Sus Ojos (The Secret in Their Eyes)) in the spectacularNine Queens(a movie David Mamet might wish he wrote), then you're a slam dunk lock to dig 'The Aura.'  This was Bielinksy's last film before he died suddenly of a heart attack in 2006.  For fans, he left a filmography that is all too short.  'The Aura' serves as a bittersweet reminder of what might have been.Another reason to watch: sultry Argentinian actress Dolores Fonzi (as Diana Dietrich).

He's a shy, dreamer and lonely man suffering from epilepsy  refractory to the drug he takes, so, he has sometimes,  seizures preceded by an ""aura"". He has a friend, Sontag, another taxidermist, but Sontag is a stronger man less cerebral than Esteban. Both men dreams with planning a perfect robbery mostly as a distraction of his lonely lives.So, they decide as a defy to go to hunting deer to a far forest near Patagonia, as they are familiar with the shape of wild animals owing his work.  In the village near the forest, there's a casino next to close, and the normal hotels are plenty, so, they are counseled to go to a modest cabin  without comfort in the deep of the wood. That's the property of a man named Dietrich, who seems to rule his cabin with hand of iron and has a servant, a mysterious young girl for the service, meals and rooms, treated as a slave. But when Esteban and Sontag arrive, Dietrich is out.At morning, the hunting party begins, but  Esteban proves to be unable to shoot and kill to the deer, scaring them with noise, so, Sontag, angry with Esteban, gets out of the hunting.Once alone, Esteban attempts to prove himself to be capable to shoot the rifle, and he hits a shadow between the trees, but then he has an aura and an epileptic attack. When the attack passes, he discovers he has killed a man by error. The victim is Dietrich.  Esteban is totally alone with the corpse in the forest. A black, wild dog, property of Dietrich, follows from that accident to Esteban strange and ominously obedient as if he was his master from ever.Terrorized, Esteban takes the documentation of Dietrich and returns to the cabin. There, the girl doesn't make any question, as Dietrich was a hard man and a true criminal. Effectively, Esteban goes to the casino to get some order in his mind, but there, an employee suspects of Esteban as he drives the small truck of Dietrich, and says to him Dietrich owes him 67000 dollars from betting in the roulette. To close this debt, Dietrich, the employee and two another criminals are planning a violent robbery to the armored car that transports the money of the casino.The two another criminals appear. They are hard gangsters and killers. Esteban has to simulate he doesn't know where is Dietrich. He says he's also in the plot, introduced by Dietrich, but the two gangsters are experienced and they soon are aware that Esteban isn't by far a professional thief. The confrontations  begins and the mature employee of the casino is killed by the gangsters. Esteban, with the black dog, has to follow the facts.The attack to the armoured car is done, but there are not two guards, but three, owing the next closing of the casino, a fact the gangsters didn't  knew. This is a bad surprise and the first two guards are shot and killed in a terrible  bloody confrontation, but the third refuges in the steel compartment of the security case with the money. At last he's killed also, but he wounds the chief of the gangsters. The three men gets away, but the chief dies from his wounds and Esteban, a wise man, finally kills the other. Then he suffers another aura and another attack.For me, the intention of the director is to do a comparison with the real, quiet quotidian life and the hallucinating facts dreamed by Esteban, so, the robbery is a specie of aura or a nightmare compared with daily, ordinary life.Or you can think, as at the end we see Esteban seated in his routine work room of taxidermy, all these adventures have been only an ""aura"".

Bielinsky is a recently deceased Argentinian director who was also responsible for other great movies, for example the critically acclaimed ""Nueve reinas"" (""Nine queens""). ""El aura"" is very different from ""Nueve reinas"", but both movies share some common traits, like their originality and the ability to easily enthrall the spectator.The main character of ""El aura"" is Esteban Espinosa (Ricardo Dar&iacute;n), an epileptict taxidermist whose favorite pastime is to plan crimes he never carries out. The title of this film makes reference to the specific moments when Esteban knows he is going to suffer an epileptic seizure, something that in his case is triggered by stressful situations. However, and due to the fact that Esteban leads a rather boring life, that doesn't happen a lot.One day, though, something changes. Esteban's wife leaves him, and, without knowing what to do or what to think, he decides to go hunting to the Patagonian forest.with an acquaintance.

There are a few puzzling moments in the script and its characters, but this isn't one of those ""Don't go in that room!"" thrillers, it's old-school/neo-noir; quietly intense and full of suspense.Ricardo Dar&iacute;n's peculiarly charactered performance is executed with such subtlety and nuance that it's hard to believe he's acting. The sound design and original score are beautiful, and so perfect for the film, they seem to be growing out of it rather than being imposed upon it. There are times when the lack of any soundtrack is deafening. The droning tensions and lilting piano ennui disappear, punctuating the moments of action with a moribund silence.Sometimes I complain when a film ends with such ambiguity it appears to be a cop-out. But not here. The ending will make you rethink the journey you were just on but it won't devalue its magnificence. This is one of those rare films where the ride is so engaging that its hard to imagine anything but disappointment merely because it does end.""Aura"" is what doctors use to describe the moment before falling into epileptic seizure.

1001541,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B000GBK52G,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[53, 56]","Don't be put off by the violence of the image on the DVD cover for this film by Argentine director Fabi&aacute;n Bielinsky. It represents one brief moment in an off-beat heist movie that is full of twists and turns that defy expectations. Focused as it is on the mental and emotional state of the lead character, played by Ricardo Dar&iacute;n, it takes a while to even come together around a heist. Withdrawn and hyper vigilant, he's a detail obsessed taxidermist who goes hunting with an acquaintance in the woods and while in pursuit of a deer shoots a man instead. And thus begins an escapade full of deceit, danger, and increasingly high stakes, all complicated by the main character's epileptic condition that produces seizures at inopportune moments.Dar&iacute;n is just fine as the taxidermist hero, rarely giving us more than a single intense expression registering puzzlement, concentration, confusion, fear, or fascination with whatever he is observing. A robbery, which he watches from across the street, has the creepy verisimilitude of amateur news media footage, random gunshots fired by unseen shooters and figures running for cover. Meanwhile, scenes set in deep woods alternate with barren and desolate expanses crossed by hard-top roads leading to distant towns. As with Bielinsky's previous feature ""Nine Queens,"" this film mixes genres that lead to interesting ambiguities and unexpected results.

Summers,"[3, 4]","For an epileptic, robbing banks, casinos, and armored cars poses some unique challenges.Esteban is a mild mannered taxidermist, prone to grand mal seizures. Right before a seizure he experiences auras, which he eloquently describes as a moment in time when he knows something [a seizure] is going to happen, and has absolutely no control over it.Esteban spends his days fantasizing about committing the perfect heist, while quietly selecting glass eyes for his customer's recent trophy kills. He has the perfect job for daydreaming about an elegant crime where everything goes as planned, and no one gets hurt. Clearly it's been a while since Esteban rented `Reservoir Dogs'.Set in the woods outside Buenos Aires, `The Aura' is a well-timed, crime thriller. It has all the elements of an urban genre: a down-on-his-luck protagonist, a mysterious woman, and some really, really, bad guys.Although he is not a hunter, Esteban begrudgingly agrees to take a hunting trip with his buddy. An overbooked hotel manager recommends a nearby rustic hunting lodge run by a husband and wife. Deep in the woods, and angered by his friend's chiding, he decides to shoot a deer. This single action brings reality to Esteban's dream, as he fits himself into the planning and execution of an armored car robbery.Much like a seizure, once his plan is set in motion, it roars out of control, with violent and unique consequences. Starring Ricardo Darin as Esteban. Darin also played the arrogant con man in  `Nine Queens', which was later remade in the US as `The Criminal' starring John C.
