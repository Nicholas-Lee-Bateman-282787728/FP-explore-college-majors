Although the kids are the stars here, Agrelo's camera pays respect to the efforts of teachers like Yomaira Reynoso, Rodney Lopez and Alex Tchassov who really seem to be in this for the kids, not for themselves (and, god knows, certainly not for the money).  I think it's Ms. Reynoso who best expresses what's going on here - she says something along the lines of wanting to expose these nine- and ten-year-old kids to their creative sides to unlock whatever talent might be inside there.  And, you can actually see that clicking in a couple of these kids.  It's spine-tingling to watch that happening.

926276,A3QVI57VT1VGRO,B000ADS6DA,"bensmomma ""bensmomma""","[9, 9]","This documentary about New York's citywide ballroom dancing competition among public school 5th-graders has frequently been compared to the recent documentary ""Spellbound"" (about a spelling competition).  And, in fact, ""Mad Hot Ballroom"" has a great deal of Spellbound's charm.  There is something really engaging about seeing a 10 or 11-year-old come into his/her own.  An adult may stand a bit outside himself (a bit of concern about ""am I silly"" or ""what are you thinking about me while I dance""), but a kid is just DANCING - an entirely earnest and genuine experience unmediated by an adults self-consciousness.The filmmakers, likes Spellbound's, follow a ""one from Column A, one from Column B"" formula for choosing dance teams to follow.  At the first round, there is an upscale school in Tribeca, a melting-pot group of Brooklynites, and an energetic and wholly Dominican team from upper Manhattan's Washington Heights.  The kids from all schools are engaging and winsome, although the filmmakers indulge in a little stereotyping via editing (a wealthy Tribeca girl is very confident before the competition (in a sweet way) but the Tribeca team cries and complains afterwards, whereas the down-to-earth Brooklynites look endearingly dorky and take their loss with a them's-the-break attitude).The film's real energy, however, comes directly from the Dominican team, whose authentically wonderful and instinctive dancing allows us to combine the drama of kids competing with the reward of watching some mad hot dancing.It's not a kid's movie, however; it's pretty long.  Actual fifth-grade boys will recoil at the idea of watching a movie that involves dancing with real girls.  Younger girls (my six-year-old) will find it hard to sit still that long - the dancing will appeal to them, but the interviews less so.  Adults will love it, though: watching the winning team will make you wanna mambo!Conclusion: 5 for adults, 4 for girls, boys - your mileage will vary.",5,Can you mambo like a fifth grader?,1121817600,"07 20, 2005",2005,1971,"['documentary', 'New', 'York', 'citywide', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'competition', 'public', 'school', '5th-graders', 'frequently', 'been', 'compared', 'recent', 'documentary', 'Spellbound', 'spelling', 'competition', 'fact', 'Mad', 'Hot', 'Ballroom', 'great', 'deal', 'Spellbound', 'charm', 'something', 'really', 'engaging', 'seeing', '10', '11-year-old', 'come', 'own', 'adult', 'may', 'stand', 'bit', 'outside', 'bit', 'concern', 'am', 'silly', 'what', 'are', 'thinking', 'dance', 'kid', 'just', 'DANCING', 'entirely', 'earnest', 'genuine', 'experience', 'unmediated', 'adults', 'self-consciousness.The', 'filmmakers', 'Spellbound', 'follow', 'one', 'Column', 'A', 'one', 'Column', 'B', 'formula', 'choosing', 'dance', 'teams', 'follow', 'first', 'round', 'upscale', 'school', 'Tribeca', 'melting-pot', 'group', 'Brooklynites', 'energetic', 'wholly', 'Dominican', 'team', 'upper', 'Manhattan', 'Washington', 'Heights', 'kids', 'schools', 'are', 'engaging', 'winsome', 'filmmakers', 'indulge', 'little', 'stereotyping', 'editing', 'wealthy', 'Tribeca', 'girl', 'very', 'confident', 'competition', 'sweet', 'way', 'Tribeca', 'team', 'cries', 'complains', 'afterwards', 'down-to-earth', 'Brooklynites', 'look', 'endearingly', 'dorky', 'take', 'loss', ""them's-the-break"", 'attitude', 'film', 'real', 'energy', 'however', 'directly', 'Dominican', 'team', 'authentically', 'wonderful', 'instinctive', 'dancing', 'combine', 'drama', 'kids', 'competing', 'reward', 'watching', 'mad', 'hot', 'dancing.It', 'not', 'kid', 'movie', 'however', 'pretty', 'long', 'Actual', 'fifth-grade', 'boys', 'will', 'recoil', 'idea', 'watching', 'movie', 'dancing', 'real', 'girls', 'Younger', 'girls', 'six-year-old', 'will', 'find', 'hard', 'sit', 'still', 'long', 'dancing', 'will', 'appeal', 'interviews', 'less', 'so', 'Adults', 'will', 'love', 'watching', 'winning', 'team', 'will', 'make', 'wan', 'mambo', 'Conclusion', '5', 'adults', '4', 'girls', 'boys', 'mileage', 'will', 'vary']",N/A
926277,A2F3SXHT6RBV81,B000ADS6DA,"Betty Burks ""Betty  Burks""","[2, 20]","In New York City, the education department decided to try a ten-week experiment with over six thousand kids to learn to compete in ballroom dancing.  It must have been a government-funded project, as this video was made of the program from beginning to the final ballroom dance.  This is a prime example of the concept resulting from the 1960s beginning of the dumbing down of American education.  Instead of exercises in phy.ed. class, the schools attempted to force middle school children [...] to act like adults by enforcing the dancing into the curriculum.  Had it been teens preparing for a prom, it might have been worthy of the money spent on the professional dance instructors, but to give the kids no alternative but to take part in this project was what is known as coersion of the worst sort.Had that been a part of school here in the South, it would not have endured ten weeks.  I did not learn how to dance as I was a good little Baptist girl.  Two of the boys did not participate because of religion beliefs, they said, but they had to sit and watch the other kids make fools of themselves.  What was Arthur Murray for except to teach in a professional environment the people who chose to learn how to dance.  Music was my thing -- the vocal part of popular standars and ballads, but being a shy Southern girl who hated to get on the trampoline at Central High, the dance classes would not have worked.  Oh, we did have tap dancers while I was a singer.In 1999, Al Curtis had a swing orchestra and a local radio station (thanks, Eddy Roy) had monthly free dancing at a fancy hotel downtown.  It was a pleasure to watch the women with their colorful dress-up frocks as they swirled around the dance floor with the men in suits as their rocks to lean on.  Sometimes, the younger dance teachers would show out with their fancy maneuvers, but it was for the public and was fun and a joy to watch.  Now, with the ballroom dancing constantly on television, it has turned into a farce and the women dress like ice skaters with hardly any clothes, all skin showing.  Is this what we want our children in America to emulate?The youngsters in this docu-picture had no way out, they were put in adult posturing and situations before they were mature enough to know that dancing is making love to music.  The girls were ill at ease and the boys less than desirable as dance partners.  This is one DVD I would rather not to have gotten from Netflix.  It was on PBS sometime back and I watched a bit.  This one put me to sleep.  So, what else is new in today's perspective of educating the children for life after high school.  What about drama?  What about teaching them to speak English properly and learn how to write down their feelings?

926278,A20RQB3SXOQCGF,B000ADS6DA,Birdman,"[4, 4]","It's been a long time since I studied Documentary Film at University of Pennsylvania, but I recall the adage that documentaries are THE primary cinematic form, that fictitious film lay on a less elevated plane.While I don't agree with that, I feel some documentaries -- such as this warm and funny account of a co-curricular program in the five boroughs of Manhattan that took the city by storm a few years back -- simply break the mold.Imagine: 6,000 sixth and seventh graders with no ballroom dancing experience who enter a 60-school tournament which rises to an uproarious climax -- and victory for a handful of gifted students and teachers.Like the greatest documentaries about schoolchildren, this one reframes the mission of education and spurns the one-size-fits all curriculum. Writer, Amy Sewell and Director, Marilyn Agrello also allow their young students to share pearls of wisdom on relaationships between the sexes, on romance, marriage, families -- and more, conveying ulttimate respect to the kids on the way.If I could cite one thing I absolutely loved about this film, it would be  Claudia Raschke-Robinson's amazing camera. This cinematographer loves faces and allows the heartbreaking beauty of these emerging adolescents to shine through both physically and emotionally.  She understands the traumas associated with coming of age, with trying to dance for the first time, the awkwardness of locking eyes with a stranger during the first steps of the meringue.But there is much grace here and serious respect for children and pre-teens.  There is also eembedded here an homage to Latino musical tradition, much of it exported from Cuba, that deserves closer study.It questions the concept of physical fitness in public schools, and does it in a way that charms the shoes off the audience.  Would you rather do a squat-thrust or the mambo?I've seen this film twice in theatres and will watch it once or twice at home.  I have it slotted for five Christmas gifts -- most to educators and administrators, but also to a dancer I know.This is superb filmmaking -- and don't let the lala cinema purists whine about its ""sentimentality"" or its ""formulaic"" plot.  Having studied film and art history on the graduate level and produced a brrieef documentary myself, I can say that if you miss this one, you've really missed a winner.Ten stars.  No bull.

Really finding something you're good at, whether you felt like practicing or not.  It made me wonder what ever happened to the rest of the awkward kids.  Having a program of ballroom dancing should be available to 4th & 5th graders everywhere.  The confidence they develop is something they surely will not forget.  I learned a lot about the ""heart"" of a dancer, by watching these pre-teens.  They all tried and because of that, they all were winners.  But as with any competition, there is ultimately one winner.Watch and see how these children develop.  Watch with your family.  Definitely watch if you are a teacher.  My only wish was that the DVD offered special features.  I would have liked to see a featurette on all the dances but teaching us (the viewer) instead.  The words they used to teach kids is much different and more fun.  It would have also been nice to include clips from the other schools, that were most certainly edited out for time.  The documentary follows 3 schools but several were involved, so it would be easy to include clips about them also, in the special features.I also applaud the teachers.  They had so much heart.  They did well by showing us how to pep up ""tired"" kids.  So buy this movie.  You and your kids (if you have any) will watch this again and again.

926284,AUHG8KSHI529U,B000ADS6DA,Craig Matteson,"[6, 6]","A friend recommended this film to me, and I am very glad she did.  It is a delightful documentary about some eleven-year-old elementary school kids in New York who are participating in a program that teaches them four ballroom dances.  They then compete as a school team in a series of dance contests with one of the schools emerging as the champion dancing team.The contest is important only insofar as it sparks the kids to focus and improve.  The same is true of the film.  Following the contest provides a structure to the film, but being a documentary, the outcome is pretty well determined and we see the outcome well in advance.  However, the structure of the film is simply the road we take to see the real delights of this story.We see very different teachers working with their classes.  These kids a generally from impoverished areas of the city and many without a solid home environment backing them up.  One of the great moments in the film for me was one wonderful girl talking about how she felt after not getting into the finals.  She said that she felt so good about participating because it was the first time in her life that she felt that she could succeed, that someone was pulling for her.  It was such a delight to see her get such a positive experience under any circumstance, but especially to take it away from a disappointment!We follow another fine boy from that team and see him talking to the judge afterwards about why they lost.  The kind judge discusses how close it was and that they were only three points behind the team going to the finals (this is from a score of hundreds of points).  The boy says that he doesn't understand and is genuinely bewildered about why his dream isn't coming true.  Later, in another interview with that team, the boy says that he realizes that if they could have all just done one thing a bit better it would have made the difference, that he realizes that he could have done a bit better than he did.  Again, this is a marvelous lesson for anyone to learn at any stage in life, let alone as an eleven year old.We also get to see kids learning to socialize, boys and girls learning about each other and becoming more comfortable with each other.  That is also an important step in life.  Ballroom dancing, where you actually have to touch each other, in a proper way of course, and coordinate steps and movements together, is a fabulous way to help kids make that important social breakthrough.Yes, we are happy for the team that eventually does win, and we hurt for all the wonderful kids who do not win.  These kids dance their merengues, tangos, rumbas, and swings so well that they are a delight to watch.  It is marvelous.  These teachers are to be commended and these children praised.

926288,ADS5APY1NKTL4,B000ADS6DA,"D. Pawl ""Dani""","[6, 6]","I had wanted to see ""Mad Hot Ballroom"" for quite sometime, since I heard about it.  I was a child who was fortunate to have exposure to dance, and I am so glad it did, because it quite literally saved my life.  This is actually a common experience, found very self-evident in ""Mad Hot Ballroom,"" and in the eyes of the young stars we see blossom on the dance floor.Only several years ago, a free, afterschool dance program was implemented into several New York City elementary schools.  This offered an opportunity for children who normally didn't have access to dance, outside of school, the chance to gain exposure to the mambo, rumba, tango, merengue and jive, and also gain invaluable self confidence in the process.  This film touched my heart and my soul, and made me laugh and cry, as I also found myself tapping my feet to the rhythm and joyfully cheering on the young and talented amature performers.  We follow the footsteps of young, predominantly Dominican students, from Washington Heights (one of the poorest, predominantly Latino neighborhoods in New York City), as their hard-nosed teacher, Yomaira (also of Dominican ancestry), leads them through their regimented practices.  You can tell this woman wants to win it as badly as her kids (if not more so).  We also see Alex, a Russian dance instructor, at a neighboring school, lead his kids through the footwork.  He has, by far, a more gentle touch with his young pupils.What really makes the film special, is our glimpse, as the audience into the eyes, opinions and intelligent observations made by these young ladies and gentlemen.  While the young group of Dominicana girls from the Washington Heights school, strive to rise above their circumstances (which include single parent homes, thug life and drug dealing), other children feel they were born to perform and that this dance program is a jumping up point for them to build their resumes!This is a great, inspiring little film.  It makes me want to go teach in New York City, and inspire the new generation.  There is nothing more valuable than an exposure to the arts.  The younger you have it, the more beneficial.

She speaks directly into the camera while students talk amongst themselves in her classroom.  She puts her best, most professional foot forward for the camera, to best express the importance of what she is doing in an honest but demure and educated fashion.  But when she thinks about what she is witnessing, more than what she is doing for these children, her heart becomes full and overflows before our eyes.  She knows what she has to say is the most important thing for people to get about what she is doing and the entire movie--and maybe her life's work--but she tries to say it without crying, until she realizes she cannot.She finally loses her polite smile as her lips begin to tremble and says something to the effect of ""I'm watching them become ladies and gentlemen..."" and the tears begin rolling down her cheeks.Not to mention mine.If you ever find a movie that can make you believe in the redemptive power of art, the joyful majesty of dance, the culturally kaleidescopic beauty of New York City and the fact that ""the children"" really are ""the future"" simultaneously better or moreso than this film, please e-mail me and tell me the title so I can go and buy it.  I had an apatrment in Manhattan about a twenty minute walk uptown from the first school showcased in this documentary MAD HOT BALLROOM, but I can tell you, a person in Des Moine or Chicago--or Beijing, for that matter--will be as deeply touched by this movie as any native New Yorker.  Other reviewers have wisely revealed that part of the magic exists in the documentarists making you care about the lives of specific children involved in this.  You really have to see the film to see how true that is.  But that serves as the vehicle through which we are led to discover how incredible the dance competition is, and how important it is as a cultural phenomenon.I walked away from this movie feeling this: if the Constitution were set to music, the music would be jazz.

926290,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000ADS6DA,Grady Harp,"[7, 8]","MAD HOT BALLROOM is an example of how fine documentary filmmaking can create more drama, comedy, insight, and sensitivity than regular films.  The reason seems to be one of honesty: honesty in approaching the subject matter, honesty in allowing the lives of the individuals involved in the story to speak clearly without superficially imposed emotion, and honesty in presenting the subject for what it is instead of moralizing or judging.The 'cast' includes some of the most interesting and wise children from the various schools in New York (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bensonhurst, etc) whose comments while not on the dance floor are penetrating in insight as to the various living conditions they represent.  Quite simply, they are unforgettable kids, from the wise Emma, to the hyperactive Michael, to the eloquently non-English speaking Wilson - the list is endless. Equally compelling are the reactions from the various teachers and principals of the schools involved in this ballroom dancing competition.  These are the kinds of dedicated teachers and administrators that are role models for teachers across the country. The interactions between teacher and children are clearly a one on one situation, not some formula that wouldn't fit from one area to the next.The dancing itself is fun to observe: these kids not only take on the tango, merengue, rumba, swing, two-step etc, they also finesse the partnership behavior that extend from the gentility of the dance floor into the growing, out of class relationships, serving as rays of hope and proof that given opportunity and support and encouragement from staff and peers, many of these disenfranchised kids can turn their lives into positive ventures.The photography and editing and 'direction' are superb and the tension for each level of the competition builds in us as viewers as strongly as it is lived by the kids.

926299,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000ADS6DA,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","Catching up on some recent documentaries, I was eager to check out ""Mad Hot Ballroom."" A critical and commercial success upon its release, ""the movie details a school system in New York City that utilizes competitive ballroom dancing as a part of its after-school curriculum. Of course, this film is a crowd pleaser--what's not to love about seeing fifth graders doing the tango? But more than that, it showcases an alternative program that has increased in popularity and works to socialize inner city youth. Teaching responsibility and respect, in addition to dance steps, this program is being used as an invaluable tool to enhance the education system in some not-so-privileged areas.The film gives you a glimpse at several schools and takes you through the practice rounds through to the citywide finals. You meet many of the students, instructors, and parents--and what is clear is that ballroom has become an unlikely passion for many of the participants. The students are engaging and candid interview subjects, and the male/female dynamic of the fifth graders is documented interestingly. Competitive, without being cruel, there are real stakes involved for these kids and their teachers. But there can also be disappointment, and the communication about not winning is a vital part of the curriculum.""Mad Hot Ballroom"" is a gentle and pleasing documentary that can be viewed by the whole family. I am impressed that, in this day and age, such an unorthodox program was allowed. With big city education systems dependent on status quo performance and test scores, it's fascinating to look at an experiment that was ""outside the box"" which not only worked, but flourished.

If learning to dance can be fascinating when you are dealing with kids in elementary school, then it might be equally interesting when watching grown ups as well (not that I am capable of working any such magic on the dance floor, even in my wildest dreams).  The only difference is that there is no way in the world that the adults get as much out of the experience as the kids seen in this 2005 documentary from writer Amy Sewell and director Marilyn Agrelo.For some reason that passeth understanding ten years ago a couple of New York City elementary schools started teaching ten weeks of ballroom dancing as a required course for fifth graders.  This unlikely pilot program took root and by 2004 there were over 60 school in New York City that were not only enrolled in the program but sending their cherubs out to compete.  Their regular teachers offer support and encouragement, but the chief instructors for the kids come from the American Ballroom Theater.  The competition allows each school to send five pairs and one alternate to dance the merengue, rumba, tango, foxtrot and good old-fashioned swing dancing.The focus of ""Mad Hot Ballroom"" is on a trio of schools that certainly reflect the diversity of public schools in the Big Apple.  PS 112 is in Bensonhurst, where what was once an Italian neighborhood now has a large Asian population, PS 115 in Washington Heights, where most families are extremely poor ones from the Dominican Republic, and PS 150 in Tribeca, where it seems everybody's parents are divorced.  But what the kids all have in common is that they are not yet teenagers, which means puberty is just about to turn their lives upside done.  This means being forced to go up and actually touch someone of the opposite sex could well be more than educational for some of these youngsters.This matters because the camera being wielded by Claudia Raschke is being held down on the same level that the kids are living out their lives and dreaming of winning the competition.  The adults get to talk and sometimes cry over what the kids are doing, but this one is all about the little people.  I suppose the filmmakers stacked the deck a bit in choosing these three schools and while I was thrilled that the school I thought should win actually won, I bet what you will remember most are the crushed kids who do not exactly ""lose,"" but who do not move on in the competition.  No matter how many losing locker rooms you have seen in your life, none of them will be as painful or as revealing as the post mortem these kids conduct on what happened.This documentary won the Audience Award at the 2005 Philadelphia Film Festival and it is easy to see why.  Even with these kids kept at a distance by the camera this is a touching film and rather than overtly making a case the filmmakers simply let us watch what happens.  In an age when Michael Moore has replaced Ken Burns as the most famous documentarian around, there is much to be said for a non-rhetorical approach in this field.  By the end of this engrossing two hours you might be ready to go down to your local elementary school and insist the kids be taught ballroom dancing, even if your youngest is now in high school.",5,Anyone can make it if they know how to shake it,1132790400,"11 24, 2005",2005,3328,"['did', 'not', 'watch', 'Dancing', 'Stars', 'might', 'have', 'check', 'out', 'next', 'time', 'watching', 'Mad', 'Hot', 'Ballroom', 'learning', 'dance', 'can', 'be', 'fascinating', 'when', 'are', 'dealing', 'kids', 'elementary', 'school', 'then', 'might', 'be', 'equally', 'interesting', 'when', 'watching', 'grown', 'ups', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'am', 'capable', 'working', 'such', 'magic', 'dance', 'floor', 'even', 'wildest', 'dreams', 'only', 'difference', 'way', 'world', 'adults', 'get', 'as', 'much', 'experience', 'kids', 'seen', '2005', 'documentary', 'writer', 'Amy', 'Sewell', 'director', 'Marilyn', 'Agrelo.For', 'reason', 'understanding', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'couple', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'elementary', 'schools', 'started', 'teaching', 'ten', 'weeks', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'required', 'course', 'fifth', 'graders', 'unlikely', 'pilot', 'program', 'took', 'root', '2004', 'were', '60', 'school', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'were', 'not', 'only', 'enrolled', 'program', 'sending', 'cherubs', 'compete', 'regular', 'teachers', 'offer', 'support', 'encouragement', 'chief', 'instructors', 'kids', 'come', 'American', 'Ballroom', 'Theater', 'competition', 'school', 'send', 'five', 'pairs', 'one', 'alternate', 'dance', 'merengue', 'rumba', 'tango', 'foxtrot', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'swing', 'dancing.The', 'focus', 'Mad', 'Hot', 'Ballroom', 'trio', 'schools', 'certainly', 'reflect', 'diversity', 'public', 'schools', 'Big', 'Apple', 'PS', '112', 'Bensonhurst', 'where', 'what', 'was', 'once', 'Italian', 'neighborhood', 'now', 'large', 'Asian', 'population', 'PS', '115', 'Washington', 'Heights', 'where', 'most', 'families', 'are', 'extremely', 'poor', 'ones', 'Dominican', 'Republic', 'PS', '150', 'Tribeca', 'where', 'everybody', 'parents', 'are', 'divorced', 'what', 'kids', 'have', 'common', 'are', 'not', 'yet', 'teenagers', 'puberty', 'just', 'turn', 'lives', 'done', 'being', 'forced', 'go', 'up', 'actually', 'touch', 'someone', 'opposite', 'sex', 'could', 'well', 'be', 'more', 'educational', 'youngsters.This', 'matters', 'camera', 'being', 'wielded', 'Claudia', 'Raschke', 'being', 'held', 'down', 'same', 'level', 'kids', 'are', 'living', 'out', 'lives', 'dreaming', 'winning', 'competition', 'adults', 'get', 'talk', 'sometimes', 'cry', 'what', 'kids', 'are', 'doing', 'one', 'little', 'people', 'suppose', 'filmmakers', 'stacked', 'deck', 'bit', 'choosing', 'three', 'schools', 'was', 'thrilled', 'school', 'thought', 'should', 'win', 'actually', 'won', 'bet', 'what', 'will', 'remember', 'most', 'are', 'crushed', 'kids', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'exactly', 'lose', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'move', 'competition', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'losing', 'locker', 'rooms', 'have', 'seen', 'life', 'none', 'will', 'be', 'painful', 'as', 'revealing', 'post', 'mortem', 'kids', 'conduct', 'what', 'happened.This', 'documentary', 'won', 'Audience', 'Award', '2005', 'Philadelphia', 'Film', 'Festival', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'Even', 'kids', 'kept', 'distance', 'camera', 'touching', 'film', 'rather', 'overtly', 'making', 'case', 'filmmakers', 'simply', 'let', 'watch', 'what', 'age', 'when', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'replaced', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'most', 'famous', 'documentarian', 'around', 'much', 'be', 'said', 'non-rhetorical', 'approach', 'field', 'end', 'engrossing', 'two', 'hours', 'might', 'be', 'ready', 'go', 'down', 'local', 'elementary', 'school', 'insist', 'kids', 'be', 'taught', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'even', 'youngest', 'now', 'high', 'school']",N/A

In particular, the grim, determined Dominican drill instructor lady featured throughout, and the old authoritarian white lady who shows up later in the film, the one who is desperately trying to hang on to her youth (though that battle was lost ages ago)--for these two, I think it's safe to say it was about themselves first and foremost. I hope these two ladies are dance instructors only, and not also classroom educators, for I pity their students if the latter be the case. Both of these ladies showed what only could be described as ""worship"" for the big gold trophy they were after, in their actions and in their words. Interestingly, the best all-around teachers in this movie were the ones who emphasized the learning process and had their kids get shot down by the judges early on;  they did not let themselves nor their kids engage in the worshipping of a giant trophy so that their dance instructor could whoop and holler and draw attention to herself--hey, let's save that ""just win, baby"" stuff for pro football; let's let grade school kids be grade school kids.

It differs greatly from pretty much all the documentaries I have seen because it is populated by teachers and 5th graders who begin the story completely honest and ordinary.  From there they progress in a rather ordinary fashion to - something extraordinary.  There are no Michael Jordans or Tiger Woods' or Oprah Winfreys.  But there are large numbers (we're told about 6,000 per year) of elementary school kids, many who live in neighborhoods with 97% poverty.  This film takes place over just a few months, but you can see these young kids transforming before your eyes.  In neighborhoods where they are more likely to wind up in prison than in college, you can see them stepping away from mediocrity and towards lives that you can just sense will be productive.  Since these kids aren't even in High School yet we can't say with certainty how they will turn out - but I bet a ""where are they now"" documentary 10 years from now will show many of these kids still on the ""right track"".New York took a small ballroom dancing program and turned it into a mandatory exercise for 5th graders.  Remember your own life at that time - how you'd rather touch kryptonite than the hand of someone of the opposite sex and their ""kooties"".  Yet these children are led by dedicated teachers who come to identify with their students in a way that makes them think of them as ""their"" kids.The early dancing scenes are pretty humorous in their pre-pubescent awkwardness.  As happens in 10-12 year olds, many of the girls are a half-foot taller than the boys.  They move with a clumsy physical immaturity that is not graceful.  But you can see something else - they LIKE it.  They learn dedication, so an endeavor, to a partner of the opposite sex, and to their ""team"".By long slow practices we begin to see their improvements.  They are all in practice for the city championships.  They will be paired up to dance 5 traditional dances, and we begin to keep our eye on the kids that seem to have more natural ability.  The movie moves along through regional competitions leading up to the New York finals held beside the World Trade Center site.  By this time you have been so captivated by these hard-working kids that you honestly pull for them much more than you would for fictional characters in some ""Rocky Wanna Be"" story.I'd love to see how these kids turn out.

It is a predictable film.It is a documentary with real teachers and real fifth grade students from several public schools in New York City. I especially appreciate the fact that the characters are real and not professional actors.Several people connected with this film obviously did a lot of things right.However this is much more than a film. It is a kind of demonstration project. Public schools are under assault from many quarters: the ""small government"" majority, some teachers' unions, the religious right, parochial and private schools, some home schooling families -- although most of the latter work with their neghborhood schools.My late father-in-law, who worked as a teacher during the great depression, would recount with pride how he and his fellow teachers pooled their meager resources to provide a hot breakfast for ""their kids."" After working for years at the ritual dance of union negotiations, however, he used to say that the spirit of those days was gone forever. I shed a tear as I watched this film, knowing how he would have loved to see that the spirit is not dead.This film depicts a miracle that actually happened. It is a miracle that a hulking, urban, school administration, politics, racism, unions, or sheer inertia, did not crush this initative before it got off the ground. That it happened is a miracle. That it is recorded for posterity is an even greater miracle. That you can buy it is a miracle and a great gift.If you have kids in public school, if you are interested in public schools, get this film. Show it to your friends and family. Discuss what you can do to save the public schools, for they can be the last great hope for the poorest and most vulnerable among us.

926306,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000ADS6DA,mirasreviews,"[1, 1]","In 1994, the American Ballroom Theater introduced a ballroom dance program to 5th-graders in two New York City schools. By the time ""Mad Hot Ballroom"" was made a decade later, 6,000 5th-graders in more than 60 New York City schools take the 10-week ballroom dancing course each year, culminating in a city-wide competition. Director Marilyn Agrelo and screenwriter Amy Sewell focus on ballroom dance students at 3 New York elementary schools, following their progress from 8 weeks before the competition begins until the citywide Final, where teams who have won quarterfinal and semifinal rounds will vie for Gold, and one team will win the huge Challenge Trophy. The schools are: P.S.115 in Washington Heights, P.S. 150 in Tribeca, and P.S. 112 in Brooklyn's Bensonhurst neighborhood. The filmmakers may have chosen these schools for their disparate demographics. The school in Washington Heights is populated by the children of immigrants from the Dominican Republic, 97% of whom live at or below the poverty level. Bensonhurst is working class. And Tribeca is more affluent.""Mad Hot Ballroom"" skips the tedious beginners' dance lessons and starts while the students are trying to improve their technique in anticipation of the Manhattan & Brooklyn Quarterfinals competition. They will compete in the merengue, rumba, tango, fox trot, and the swing. Each school will choose one pair to compete in each dance, plus an alternate pair, for a total of 6 couples per school. Interviews with the schools' principals and some of the dance teachers show how much these professionals care for the children and thrill at their accomplishments. The filmmakers spend a lot of time with the children, who articulate their feelings about the dance competition, boys and girls, social issues, and all sorts of things that 10- and 11-year-olds talk about. Just on the cusp of puberty and living in an urban environment, these youngsters are sophisticated and ingenuous at the same time. Their enthusiasm is a pleasure to watch, as is their dancing. -Some wonderfully talented dancers are hiding in Washington Heights. Subtitles are available in English.

Sellers ""Bookworm500""","[4, 4]","Despite it's lascivious-sounding name, Mad, Hot Ballroom is a clean, entertaining documentary which follows a number of New York City fifth grade classrooms as they prepare for a city-wide ballroom dance competition.  The film picks up at the beginning of their classroom dance practices and goes back and forth among filming the dance class practices, personally interviewing the ten and eleven year-old kids, and interviewing different teachers and administrators.  We get to see inside some of their homes and hear what is important to them.The interviewer obviously asked the kids questions such as ""What do you think about boys/girls?  What do you want to do with your life?  What's it like to live here? Why do you like ballroom dancing?""  The kids' answers are funny and poignant.  They seem to be at the age where to some boys/girls are still a bit ""icky"" to each other, but they are starting to notice the opposite gender.  Hearing the girls speak about drug dealers and their parent's not allowing them to go out of the house by themselves because it isn't safe brought a different world into focus for me.The film is charged with emotion, especially during the competitions. Will the schools we've been following win?  There really is no way to know for sure, because this is real life, not a movie. They could win or loose. The tears are real.  The excitement they felt (and we felt) waiting for scores to be tabulated was real.There is no swearing, children are respectful to adults and to each other (or they are called for it!). As far as promiscuity, boys and girls do dance together (ballroom-style, nothing touching but hands and arms) and they do sway their hips.This might not be the movie to watch if you are looking for an action-adventure night, but it was certainly worth checking out to discover a bit of America that I didn't know existed--fifth grade ballroom dancers in New York City.",5,Even my pre-teens enjoyed it!,1144800000,"04 12, 2006",2006,1912,"['lascivious-sounding', 'name', 'Mad', 'Hot', 'Ballroom', 'clean', 'entertaining', 'documentary', 'number', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'fifth', 'grade', 'classrooms', 'prepare', 'city-wide', 'ballroom', 'dance', 'competition', 'film', 'up', 'beginning', 'classroom', 'dance', 'practices', 'back', 'forth', 'filming', 'dance', 'class', 'practices', 'personally', 'interviewing', 'ten', 'eleven', 'year-old', 'kids', 'interviewing', 'different', 'teachers', 'administrators', 'get', 'see', 'homes', 'hear', 'what', 'important', 'them.The', 'interviewer', 'obviously', 'asked', 'kids', 'questions', 'such', 'What', 'do', 'think', 'boys/girls', 'What', 'do', 'want', 'do', 'life', 'What', 'live', 'here', 'Why', 'do', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'kids', 'answers', 'are', 'funny', 'poignant', 'seem', 'be', 'age', 'where', 'boys/girls', 'are', 'still', 'bit', 'icky', 'other', 'are', 'starting', 'notice', 'opposite', 'gender', 'Hearing', 'girls', 'speak', 'drug', 'dealers', 'parent', 'not', 'allowing', 'go', 'house', ""n't"", 'safe', 'brought', 'different', 'world', 'focus', 'me.The', 'film', 'charged', 'emotion', 'especially', 'competitions', 'Will', 'schools', ""'ve"", 'been', 'following', 'win', 'really', 'way', 'know', 'sure', 'real', 'life', 'not', 'movie', 'could', 'win', 'loose', 'tears', 'are', 'real', 'excitement', 'felt', 'felt', 'waiting', 'scores', 'be', 'tabulated', 'was', 'swearing', 'children', 'are', 'respectful', 'adults', 'other', 'are', 'called', 'As', 'far', 'promiscuity', 'boys', 'girls', 'do', 'dance', 'together', 'ballroom-style', 'nothing', 'touching', 'hands', 'arms', 'do', 'sway', 'hips.This', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'movie', 'watch', 'are', 'looking', 'action-adventure', 'night', 'was', 'certainly', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'discover', 'bit', 'America', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'existed', 'fifth', 'grade', 'ballroom', 'dancers', 'New', 'York', 'City']",N/A

As they learn the dances and the disciplines involved you see them change from shy skittish children to consummate dancers all culminating in the final citywide competition.You get to really know these wonderful children.

I liked the way the camera explored the kids, teachers, parents' thoughts by making dance the central character of this movie.It is amazing to see how these inner-Manhattan-city kids develop concentration, motivation, communication skills, commitment, respect for girls (and boys) and still have so much fun doing ballroom dancing. You just can imagine what a different world they are making for themselves and around themselves by becoming wonderful adults. In fifth grade, kids long for physical contact between genders but in most cultures, it is surrounded by mystery and taboo, driving them nuts and making the whole thing much bigger and scarier than in reality. I realized how much the physical contact through ballroom dancing can respond to that appetite in a safe environment, and let them know how much more there is still to discover than only the physical contact.I watched the movie with my 8 year old son who got interested by the competition, picking his own team to win. He also watched it with his girl friends from school. These girls would stand up and dance watching the movie! It got me to talk to the Superintendant of his school to see if they could run a program like this. I hope it is going to work. They don't need to be inner city kids.

There was one little boy in there who made me crack up so hard in two instances, put in the disc and jump to chapter 8 where it begins with one kid and his mom walking down steps...but it isnt that kid im talking about, fast forward after that until you see them practicing in class, its that boy who cant find his partner... oh man, you have to see him, he even looks toward the camera in confusion, and the camera is on him in this state for about 2 minutes which is long but so cute funny if you see it ...and if you fastforward more to the part where allison, their teacher, is getting ""overklempt"" watching her children growing up right before her very eyes, and then you look to the back left of the classroom, there is that boy again, laughing at her like ""nelson"" from the simpsons, and then allison runs out. i laughed because of that kid, but also cried of what allison was saying.I loved this film, completely. If you ever been proud of watching your child perform on stage in front of an audience, you will love this too. It ranges through a variety of subjects, from just having fun at shaking your butt on the dancefloor, to the issues of homosexuality.

There are some unusually good reviews by others, so I will not repeat them.  The bottom line is that this movie is for grade school what E.O. Wilson's book ""Consilience"" is for adults.  In that book he answers the questions, ""why are the humanities vital to the sciences"" and concluded that science out of context is not helpful to humanity.Watching this movie, I found myself really admiring New York City for understanding how dancing could contribute to social IQ and to human interactions.  As my own teen-ager (145+ IQ) rejects rote learning in high school, I am compelled to believe that we need to drastically change education, and do more of this social interaction, learning to learn, learning to find people who know, learning to exchange ideas rather than memorize old ideas, etcetera.As a suburban New Yorker from the 1960's, I also found that this movie considerably enhanced my appreciation for New York, and the school system, in the aftermath of 9-11.

926317,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000ADS6DA,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 2]","For many of the students who attend New York City's public schools, education often takes a back seat to the daily struggles brought about by poverty, language barriers and broken homes.  It's small wonder, then, that so many students drop out of school, turn to gangs and drugs, and lose all hope for a bright, productive future.  In an attempt to circumvent that scenario and to give its children a viable reason for staying in school, the district has implemented a program that introduces all 5th graders to the fine art of ballroom dancing.  After a year of training, the best dancers go on to compete in a citywide competition that, for many of these kids, represents the one truly positive influence in their lives.  The rapturous documentary ""Mad Hot Ballroom"" is a tribute to that program.Director Marilyn Agrelo has focused on three schools, two in Manhattan and one in Brooklyn, where the program is in full swing.  Most of the film is spent chronicling the efforts on the part of the teachers and the students to get ready for the competition.  However, the movie also offers a generous collection of clips showing the children in their off-school hours, at home or in local hangouts.  The kids are not shy about opening up for the camera as they comment on all aspects of their lives, revealing their street smarts and their refreshingly candid, canny and thoughtful assessments of the world around them.  And as the competition increases, the kids learn a little something, too, about the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.The filmmaking style - which alternates between interviews and scenes of the children dancing - is straightforward and relatively conventional, but the subject matter is so compelling in its own right that any attempt on the part of the filmmakers to fancy it up would most likely have detracted from the movie's overall value as an instructional document. If there is a flaw in the film, it is that the movie isn't as successful at differentiating the individual participants as, say, ""Spellbound,"" a movie about spelling bees which took great pains to zero in on specific children throughout the course of the film, the end result being that we really felt that we got to know them as people.  In ""Ballroom,"" however, the kids, adorable as they are, come across more as part of a herd than as a collection of clearly delineated individuals.  But the scenes centered on the competition are as filled with suspense, emotion and high drama as those in ""Spellbound.""In this day and age in which funding for the arts in public education should have its own Endangered Species Act, it's wonderful to see such a program not only surviving but flourishing in such unpromising soil.  Though the program is clearly no panacea for all of life's many ills, for these children, at least, it seems to be a major step in setting them on the right path to a future full of promise and hope.Steeped in emotion and beautiful in spirit, ""Mad Hot Ballroom"" is ""inspirational"" filmmaking in the very best sense of the term.",4,captivating documentary,1161475200,"10 22, 2006",2006,3049,"['many', 'students', 'who', 'attend', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'public', 'schools', 'education', 'often', 'back', 'seat', 'daily', 'struggles', 'brought', 'about', 'poverty', 'language', 'barriers', 'broken', 'homes', 'small', 'wonder', 'then', 'so', 'many', 'students', 'drop', 'school', 'turn', 'gangs', 'drugs', 'lose', 'hope', 'bright', 'productive', 'future', 'attempt', 'circumvent', 'scenario', 'give', 'children', 'viable', 'reason', 'staying', 'school', 'district', 'implemented', 'program', '5th', 'graders', 'fine', 'art', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'year', 'training', 'best', 'dancers', 'go', 'compete', 'citywide', 'competition', 'many', 'kids', 'one', 'truly', 'positive', 'influence', 'lives', 'rapturous', 'documentary', 'Mad', 'Hot', 'Ballroom', 'tribute', 'program.Director', 'Marilyn', 'Agrelo', 'focused', 'three', 'schools', 'two', 'Manhattan', 'one', 'Brooklyn', 'where', 'program', 'full', 'swing', 'Most', 'film', 'spent', 'chronicling', 'efforts', 'part', 'teachers', 'students', 'get', 'ready', 'competition', 'However', 'movie', 'also', 'generous', 'collection', 'clips', 'showing', 'children', 'off-school', 'hours', 'home', 'local', 'hangouts', 'kids', 'are', 'not', 'shy', 'opening', 'up', 'camera', 'comment', 'aspects', 'lives', 'revealing', 'street', 'smarts', 'refreshingly', 'candid', 'canny', 'thoughtful', 'assessments', 'world', 'competition', 'increases', 'kids', 'learn', 'little', 'something', 'too', 'thrill', 'victory', 'agony', 'defeat.The', 'filmmaking', 'style', 'interviews', 'scenes', 'children', 'dancing', 'straightforward', 'relatively', 'conventional', 'subject', 'matter', 'so', 'compelling', 'own', 'right', 'attempt', 'part', 'filmmakers', 'fancy', 'up', 'would', 'most', 'likely', 'have', 'detracted', 'movie', 'overall', 'value', 'instructional', 'document', 'flaw', 'film', 'movie', ""n't"", 'as', 'successful', 'differentiating', 'individual', 'participants', 'say', 'Spellbound', 'movie', 'spelling', 'bees', 'took', 'great', 'pains', 'zero', 'specific', 'children', 'course', 'film', 'end', 'result', 'being', 'really', 'felt', 'got', 'know', 'people', 'Ballroom', 'however', 'kids', 'adorable', 'are', 'come', 'across', 'more', 'part', 'herd', 'collection', 'clearly', 'delineated', 'individuals', 'scenes', 'centered', 'competition', 'are', 'filled', 'suspense', 'emotion', 'high', 'drama', 'Spellbound', 'day', 'age', 'funding', 'arts', 'public', 'education', 'should', 'have', 'own', 'Endangered', 'Species', 'Act', 'wonderful', 'see', 'such', 'program', 'not', 'only', 'surviving', 'flourishing', 'such', 'unpromising', 'soil', 'program', 'clearly', 'panacea', 'life', 'many', 'ills', 'children', 'least', 'be', 'major', 'step', 'setting', 'right', 'path', 'future', 'full', 'promise', 'hope.Steeped', 'emotion', 'beautiful', 'spirit', 'Mad', 'Hot', 'Ballroom', 'inspirational', 'filmmaking', 'very', 'best', 'sense', 'term']",N/A

Perhaps there is reason there, and a look at the later lives of the children would be useful, as is done in ""Born in Brothels,"" an interesting documentary about the impact of photography on children of prositutes.

926322,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000ADS6DA,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[8, 23]","""Mad Hot Ballroom"", the new documentary about fifth graders from New York Public Schools who compete in ballroom dancing competitions, desperately wants to be the next ""Spellbound"".Concentrating on teams from three schools; a school in Tribeca, a school from another part of Manhattan and a school from Brooklyn, we meet the teachers in charge of each of these programs and learn a little about the creation of the program. A brief interview with one of the administrators extols the virtues of teaching the students ballroom dancing, especially at the fifth grade level. As the programs continue, the students practice the Tango, the Rumba, the Foxtrot, the Merengue, Swing and other dances. As competition looms, the teachers have to decide which of the students will represent their teams in specific dances.""Ballroom"" is a pleasant diversion, but it fails to deliver anything of meaningful value as either a narrative or a documentary. ""Spellbound"", the documentary about students competing in the National Spelling Bee, was a great, suspenseful story following the lives of a number of the participants. The key difference between the two is that ""Spellbound"" followed a select group of the participants, to their homes, interacting with their parents, at school. We learned what made these kids tick. In ""Ballroom"", there is a key scene about halfway through. We see a couple of the parents, for the first time, as they pick their kids up and drive off with them. Or we see one of the dads roller skating with his son. Most of the parents are on screen for a fraction of a second, if that.The film's focus is too broad. After the initial introduction to the three classrooms, we meet some of the students; at times they are talking to the camera, during others, we eavesdrop on their conversations with their friends. These conversations are interesting; they talk about boys and girls, their parents, older kids who get into drugs, their hopes, etc., but because we are watching so many kids, we don't get a true feeling for what makes any one of them tick. The names of the students pop up more than once when they are on camera. Even this doesn't help us truly identify the kids because we never spend enough time with them. Only later, when only one of the schools is left in the competition do we begin to remember who they are.There are two groups at the center of this film. The students and their teachers. The two teachers supervising the Brooklyn program are given more screen time. The male teacher is clearly into the program and really wants to help these kids learn these dance moves. All of the adult supervisors seem to believe that the program helps the kids learn social skills, etiquette, deportment, responsibility and more. About halfway through the training, his female counterpart takes center stage, training the students, teaching them discipline, and more. In fact, the male teacher disappears for a long stretch of time, only to reappear during the beginning of the competition. Because of this shift, we don't really get a feeling about what makes these people tick either.The adults at the other two schools; the Tribeca program is run by a middle-aged man with an accent and his younger, more `touchy-feely' female counterpart and I can't honestly remember the people who supervised the other school's program, aren't developed at all.Why didn't the filmmakers explore the backgrounds or lives of anyone in the film? Without an emotional heart at the center of either group, the film ultimately becomes an empty excuse for watching the kids dance. Are we supposed to find it amusing? Touching? Hard work? It is difficult to say. Without a central core of characters to identify with, we can't really determine the purpose or drive behind the film.Ultimately, as all films of this type must, everything comes down to a final competition. One of the three schools goes to this competition, and they are quite good. When their team gets up to do the Rumba or the Merengue, the students jump up and down with excitement because the kids are good, very good.

926323,A2GJ98824GGXGP,B000ADS6DA,Timothy Kearney,"[2, 2]","A few years ago, some New York City Schools had an unexpected group volunteer to begin what most would believe to be a project doomed from the start. The volunteers wanted to teach children in the fifth grade ballroom dance. Now dance lessons of many varieties ranging from ballet to hip hop can interest some students, but the volunteer dance instructors wanted to involve as many children as possible, including those who might otherwise balk at such an activity. The result is enchanting. These fifth graders, some elegant, others more than rough around the edges are almost transformed into miniature Fred Astaires and Ginger Rogers, perhaps with out the finesse, but full of the joy.MAD HOT BALLROOM is a film that takes us behind the scenes of the dance instruction and competition. We follow a number of groups from the beginning lessons to the final competition. We see some succeed and others drop out of the program. In the competition scenes we see the joy of victory, but we also see the heart felt feelings of those who do not succeed. The program teaches all sorts of life lessons including that of defeat, and we see the honest reactions of the children. The school administrators tell how the program changed the lives of many students who participated and in the end, we leave feeling better for seeing the film and knowing there are programs like the ballroom dance program in schools that teach life lessons while having fun and accomplishing something worthwhile.If you're like me, you'll wish you had the agility of these young people and hope that your local school has a similar program.",4,Shall we Dance?,1140825600,"02 25, 2006",2006,1610,"['few', 'years', 'ago', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Schools', 'had', 'unexpected', 'group', 'volunteer', 'begin', 'what', 'most', 'would', 'believe', 'be', 'project', 'doomed', 'start', 'volunteers', 'wanted', 'teach', 'children', 'fifth', 'grade', 'ballroom', 'dance', 'Now', 'dance', 'lessons', 'many', 'varieties', 'ranging', 'ballet', 'hip', 'hop', 'can', 'interest', 'students', 'volunteer', 'dance', 'instructors', 'wanted', 'involve', 'many', 'children', 'possible', 'including', 'who', 'might', 'otherwise', 'balk', 'such', 'activity', 'result', 'enchanting', 'fifth', 'graders', 'elegant', 'others', 'more', 'rough', 'edges', 'are', 'almost', 'transformed', 'miniature', 'Fred', 'Astaires', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'perhaps', 'out', 'finesse', 'full', 'joy.MAD', 'HOT', 'BALLROOM', 'film', 'scenes', 'dance', 'instruction', 'competition', 'follow', 'number', 'groups', 'beginning', 'lessons', 'final', 'competition', 'see', 'succeed', 'others', 'drop', 'program', 'competition', 'see', 'joy', 'victory', 'also', 'see', 'heart', 'felt', 'feelings', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'succeed', 'program', 'sorts', 'life', 'lessons', 'including', 'defeat', 'see', 'honest', 'reactions', 'children', 'school', 'administrators', 'tell', 'how', 'program', 'changed', 'lives', 'many', 'students', 'who', 'participated', 'end', 'leave', 'feeling', 'better', 'seeing', 'film', 'knowing', 'are', 'programs', 'ballroom', 'dance', 'program', 'schools', 'teach', 'life', 'lessons', 'having', 'fun', 'accomplishing', 'something', 'worthwhile.If', ""'re"", ""'ll"", 'wish', 'had', 'agility', 'young', 'people', 'hope', 'local', 'school', 'similar', 'program']",N/A

926325,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000ADS6DA,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 9]","It is hard not to like these children practicing ballroom-dancing earnestly for the competition. It is not because of them that I give this documentary only three stars, relatively lower evaluation compared with other reviewers. I would be ready to give five stars to these kids. But not to the director, who should have spent more time with the kids.The film is based on an article by writer Amy Sewell (and co-producer of the film) in 2003 that reported the after-class ballroom-dancing program, introduced to give the children in New York City public school a chance to do and achieve something worthy - something that they can be proud of. In one sense, the film's content looks like Hollywood film, and one might remember Wes Craven film `Music of the Heart.'But `Mad Hot Ballroom' deals with the real-life kids at P.S. 150, P.S. 112 and P.S. 115 in NYC, all of whom strive to win the upcoming dancing competition. It also shows the instructors who are eager to teach the children how to dance, and some of them are, I think, alarmingly eager. As if to counterbalance the apparently over-reaching zeal of some, it also shows the glimpse of the competition organizers who make it clear that it's not about winning or losing, but it is about gold medal or silver medal.So far, the film is good. But as Amazon's review says, this is a great missed opportunity because it fails to stop and probe the problems of the educational institutions that had to introduce this activity to give the students a chance for a better life. Even if I ignore the flaw (for I consider that as a flaw, for this dancing program is nothing but part of education, not competition), too many kids appear in the film, leaving almost no impression on us except some truly smart children. After all you are not allowed to know the kids themselves. You can see their dance, but cannot see their life. This happened also in another documentary `Rize,' but at least `Rize' is intended as a tribute to the dancing itself from the beginning.Yes, I like these kids in this film, especially one smart boy Silas whose poignant remarks are much more incisive than some of the adults who seem only interested in winning the competition. His disillusioned face is more convincing and touching than the film's one-note direction, which is too upbeat to delve into the depth of the kids' life. The film is truly a missed opportunity.",3,"Kids Are Fantastic, Director Is Not: Great Missed Opportunity",1144195200,"04 5, 2006",2006,2396,"['hard', 'not', 'children', 'practicing', 'ballroom-dancing', 'earnestly', 'competition', 'not', 'give', 'documentary', 'only', 'three', 'stars', 'relatively', 'lower', 'evaluation', 'compared', 'other', 'reviewers', 'would', 'be', 'ready', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'kids', 'not', 'director', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'kids.The', 'film', 'based', 'article', 'writer', 'Amy', 'Sewell', 'co-producer', 'film', '2003', 'reported', 'after-class', 'ballroom-dancing', 'program', 'introduced', 'give', 'children', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'public', 'school', 'chance', 'do', 'achieve', 'something', 'worthy', 'something', 'can', 'be', 'proud', 'one', 'sense', 'film', 'content', 'looks', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'one', 'might', 'remember', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'film', 'Music', 'Heart', 'Mad', 'Hot', 'Ballroom', 'deals', 'real-life', 'kids', 'P.S', '150', 'P.S', '112', 'P.S', '115', 'NYC', 'whom', 'strive', 'win', 'upcoming', 'dancing', 'competition', 'also', 'instructors', 'who', 'are', 'eager', 'teach', 'children', 'how', 'dance', 'are', 'think', 'alarmingly', 'eager', 'counterbalance', 'apparently', 'over-reaching', 'zeal', 'also', 'glimpse', 'competition', 'organizers', 'who', 'make', 'clear', 'not', 'winning', 'losing', 'gold', 'medal', 'silver', 'medal.So', 'far', 'film', 'good', 'Amazon', 'review', 'great', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'stop', 'probe', 'problems', 'educational', 'institutions', 'had', 'introduce', 'activity', 'give', 'students', 'chance', 'better', 'life', 'Even', 'ignore', 'flaw', 'consider', 'flaw', 'dancing', 'program', 'nothing', 'part', 'education', 'not', 'competition', 'too', 'many', 'kids', 'appear', 'film', 'leaving', 'almost', 'impression', 'truly', 'smart', 'children', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'know', 'kids', 'can', 'see', 'dance', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'life', 'happened', 'also', 'documentary', 'Rize', 'least', 'Rize', 'intended', 'tribute', 'dancing', 'beginning.Yes', 'like', 'kids', 'film', 'especially', 'one', 'smart', 'boy', 'Silas', 'poignant', 'remarks', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'incisive', 'adults', 'who', 'seem', 'only', 'interested', 'winning', 'competition', 'disillusioned', 'face', 'more', 'convincing', 'touching', 'film', 'one-note', 'direction', 'too', 'upbeat', 'delve', 'depth', 'kids', 'life', 'film', 'truly', 'missed', 'opportunity']",N/A
926326,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B000ADS6DA,Tucker Andersen,"[37, 42]","This documentary provides a fascinating ""slice of life"" glimpse into a not widely known program to provide instruction in ballroom dancing to fifth graders in the NYC public school system. Since the program's introduction on an experimental basis several years ago it has been gradually expanded into several schools throughout the city and encompasses students with a broad range of nationalities and socioeconomic backgrounds. As you might guess and the documentary makes clear, it is by definition a ""labor of love"" for everyone involved: the instructors who volunteer their time, the school faculty and administration, and the kids and their parents. This is one of several programs which have proved immensely successful, others involve musical instructional, other forms of dance, theater and finally sports, including one overseen by the NY Road Runners Club with which I am very familiar involving organized running activities and races. Their scope is limited only by the time constraints faced by their organizers and volunteers and their usually meager financial resources. The kids not only enjoy themselves and develop a sense of self-worth and much better self-image, but learn many of the ""lessons-of-life"" imparted by such activities. These include the value of training, discipline and hard work, the necessity for teamwork and of course, ""the joy of victory and the agony of defeat"". This film poignantly demonstrates how tough a lesson it is for many of them to accept the truth of Grantland Rice's immortal summary, ""when the One Great Scorer comes to write against your name, he marks - not that you won or lost - but how you played the game"".The film follows in detail the progress of students from three different schools, and uses the camera as the moviegoers' window into how the program affects everyone involved. It is almost entirely composed of film clips of the kids in class and interacting with their friends in other social situations and with their teachers; there are also a few brief supplemental commentaries from interviews with the kids, their parents and primarily the teachers. We then follow them through the stages of the competition including the finals held at the World Financial Center in downtown Manhattan. During the competition we also briefly meet several of the other teams, including the previous year's champions. One of the interesting juxtapositions is the team from Washington Heights (one of the poorest neighborhoods in NYC and a section where many of the kids come from one- parent families and who have to take the subway to the competition and buy their outfits at the local bargain store) competing on a par with the kids from a much more upscale neighborhoods and whose team gets private transportation to the finals.This is a film which will appeal to a wide range of individuals, especially those who are captivated by kids and dancing. It is a human interest documentary that captures some truly inspirational stories. It was fascinating to meet the girls who became so excited they decided they want to pursue dancing as their careers, and heartwarming to hear one of the immigrant mothers discuss her aspirations for her daughter as follows (paraphrase) "" My hope is that she will become a doctor, but if she decides she wants to become a dancer when she grows up, then I will totally support her in realizing her dreams"".The obvious comparison to this movie is another sleeper hit documentary involving competition among schoolkids, SPELLBOUND. This film is much more fun, but at least for me was not as totally engrossing. In some ways this is a combination of SPELLBOUND and the underappreciated 2004 version of SHALL WE DANCE, starring Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez, Susan Sarandon, Anita Gillette and Stanley Tucci. Of course, MAD HOT BALLROOM is not a fictional story but instead involves the real life impact of dancing on kids at a vulnerable and formative age; however, SHALL WE DANCE also uses dance as a metaphor for life and examines its power to change and inspire individuals while also simply showcasing the beautiful experience that dance can become for both the participants and the audience.The tension in SPELLBOUND built more slowly and was more sustained and the in depth interviews with several of those students and additional background information about the competition involved me much more in that story and made it more interesting to me. Thus, while this movie did not quite rise to the level of five stars for me, it was certainly a close call; dance fans who love to swing, meringue, and tango will undoubtedly be even more captivated than I was. In summary, if you are fortunate enough that this movie is shown in a theater near you, I strongly recommend it if you are looking for interesting story that you can just sit back and enjoy which has the added advantage of being even more appealing because it is true.Tucker Andersen",4,(4+) Dancing Lessons,1119398400,"06 22, 2005",2005,4930,"['documentary', 'fascinating', 'slice', 'life',
