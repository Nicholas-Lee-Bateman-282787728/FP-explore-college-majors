Some of the fissures should have been worked out of before the episodes were aired. But hey nothing's perfect.[My most memorable charcters for me were Orko, Evil-in and The Sorceress]The most disturbing thing I found was the lack of reference to his sister through out the serious. For those who did not keep up with She-Ra Princess of Power that is his sister. I think it was mostly due to the possibility that He-Man serious of the late 80s was already at an end by the time She-Ra started. (as far as the writing goes)King Randor had two babies, a set of twins Prince Adam and Princess Adora. (He -Man and  She-Ra) On the show I watched He-Man appeared quite often but she never appeared on He-Man so it was kind of like they never bothered to include her fighting along his side from time to time. Maybe the writers didn't think it was wise to write her in at least sometime into the second year, I don't know. But I'll have to include it into my collection.

The first documentary is titled ""The Stories of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe."" It's an interesting documentary where various people involved with the show speak about the final 32 episodes.  Much of the conversations are about the episodes ""The Greatest Show in Eternia"" and ""Not So Blind.""  It is mentioned that the writers and people involved with the show knew before production started that despite good ratings this would be the last season due to decisions from financial backers. It was also mentioned by one writer that the show had pretty much run it's course.  By the show being episodic in nature, everything had to be wrapped up by the end of each episode.

1010013,AHF97M45JFCB,B000H5U65W,ONENEO,"[3, 3]","Whoever coined the term ""all good things must come to an end"" was surely influenced by Filmation's epic fantasy show, He-Man and the Masters of the Universe. As hard as it is to imagine, the second volume of the second season represents the grand finale of the entire 130-show run. Coming from a fan of the show since its days in syndication, it was with great interest that I set off on a voyage of blissful nostalgia in reviewing the entire He-Man and the Masters of the Universe DVD series from BCI. When presented with the notion of 130 episodes spanning across 4 box sets of 6 discs each, it is easy to get into the false notion that the good times will never end. Unfortunately, here we are at the final installment of the classic series.Despite the fact that there is an unmistakable sadness that taints the viewing experience (after all, we realize that this is goodbye), the show's writers managed to break out of the slight slump that they apparently fallen into during the first half of the season. Unlike the first half, where additions to Mattel's corresponding toy line meant the introduction to several new characters (save Roboto), the second half works more closely with the formula discovered in the first season: the plots are bit more lesson-oriented but with slightly richer animation quality.At this point in time, the Filmation creative machine was changing gears for the upcoming She-Ra: Princess of Power series but their efforts in closing out He-Man were a worthy farewell. Those expecting some kind of closure or finale may be disappointed to learn that each and every episode of the 130 was designed to be a stand-alone plot (with resolve) and # 130 is no different. Interestingly, Larry Ditillio (one of the show's staff writers) went on to say that had Filmation decided to write multi-part episodes, it is likely that they would have had no shortage of material to work from for future seasons. As it stands, the reason for the show's demise was based not only on a lack of financial backing but also because the writers were basically tapped out as far as developing an additional 65 (or more) stand-alone plots was concerned.Preventing this experience from being ridden with sadness, fans can take solace in the fact that BCI has gone the extra mile to continue releasing their excellent He-Man related DVD sets to enjoy. Directly following this incarnation of the show are three 6-disc She-Ra: Princess of Power DVD sets, two 6-disc New Adventures of He-Man sets, and at present, the first (of three) 3-disc sets has been released celebrating the impressive 2002 Mike Young Productions version of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe.I've said it before and I'll say it again: About the best thing that can happen to a series is discovering that BCI is the company bringing it to DVD release. This installment is no exception!Included on this 6-disc compilation are the following episodes:Hunt For He-ManThe Greatest Show On EterniaNot So BlindRevenge Is Never SweetThe Good Shall SurviveThe Secret Of GrayskullNo Job Too SmallThe Bitter RoseThe GamblerTeela's TriumphOrko's New FriendThe Problem With PowerDouble TroubleThe Eternia FlowerHappy Birthday RobotoBattle Of The DragonsTime Doesn't FlyHere, There, Skeletors EverywhereBeauty And The BeastOrko's ReturnVisitors From EarthMonster On The MountainThe Magic FallsSearch For A SonMistaken IdentityThe Toy MakerBargin With EvilCapture The Comet KeeperThe Ancient Mirror Of AvatharThe GamesTo Save The CreaturesThe Cold ZoneExtras are once again abounding. The sixth disc contains inspiration for some of the various episodes between numbers 99-130, facts and trivia, scripts etc. Also noteworthy is the fantastic conclusion to the multi-part Filmation history called Animating He-Man and the Masters of the Universe. Very interesting stuff! 3 episodes contain full audio commentary and like always, BCI packs in a pair of 4x6"" collectible art cards, this time from artists: Dan Brereton and Mike McKone.",4,Great Series Comes To An End,1209945600,"05 5, 2008",2008,3995,"['coined', 'term', 'good', 'things', 'must', 'come', 'end', 'was', 'surely', 'influenced', 'Filmation', 'epic', 'fantasy', 'show', 'He-Man', 'Masters', 'Universe', 'As', 'hard', 'imagine', 'second', 'volume', 'second', 'season', 'grand', 'finale', 'entire', '130-show', 'run', 'Coming', 'fan', 'show', 'days', 'syndication', 'was', 'great', 'interest', 'set', 'off', 'voyage', 'blissful', 'nostalgia', 'reviewing', 'entire', 'He-Man', 'Masters', 'Universe', 'DVD', 'series', 'BCI', 'When', 'presented', 'notion', '130', 'episodes', 'spanning', '4', 'box', 'sets', '6', 'discs', 'easy', 'get', 'false', 'notion', 'good', 'times', 'will', 'never', 'end', 'Unfortunately', 'here', 'are', 'final', 'installment', 'classic', 'series.Despite', 'fact', 'unmistakable', 'sadness', 'viewing', 'experience', 'realize', 'goodbye', 'show', 'writers', 'managed', 'break', 'slight', 'slump', 'apparently', 'fallen', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'first', 'half', 'where', 'additions', 'Mattel', 'corresponding', 'toy', 'line', 'meant', 'introduction', 'several', 'new', 'characters', 'save', 'Roboto', 'second', 'half', 'more', 'closely', 'formula', 'discovered', 'first', 'season', 'plots', 'are', 'bit', 'more', 'lesson-oriented', 'slightly', 'richer', 'animation', 'quality.At', 'point', 'time', 'Filmation', 'creative', 'machine', 'was', 'changing', 'gears', 'upcoming', 'She-Ra', 'Princess', 'Power', 'series', 'efforts', 'closing', 'out', 'He-Man', 'were', 'worthy', 'farewell', 'expecting', 'kind', 'closure', 'finale', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'learn', 'episode', '130', 'was', 'designed', 'be', 'stand-alone', 'plot', 'resolve', '130', 'different', 'Interestingly', 'Larry', 'Ditillio', 'one', 'show', 'staff', 'writers', 'went', 'say', 'had', 'Filmation', 'decided', 'write', 'multi-part', 'episodes', 'likely', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'shortage', 'material', 'work', 'future', 'seasons', 'reason', 'show', 'demise', 'was', 'based', 'not', 'only', 'lack', 'financial', 'backing', 'also', 'writers', 'were', 'basically', 'tapped', 'out', 'as', 'far', 'developing', 'additional', '65', 'more', 'stand-alone', 'plots', 'was', 'concerned.Preventing', 'experience', 'being', 'ridden', 'sadness', 'fans', 'can', 'take', 'solace', 'fact', 'BCI', 'gone', 'extra', 'mile', 'continue', 'releasing', 'excellent', 'He-Man', 'related', 'DVD', 'sets', 'enjoy', 'Directly', 'following', 'incarnation', 'show', 'are', 'three', '6-disc', 'She-Ra', 'Princess', 'Power', 'DVD', 'sets', 'two', '6-disc', 'New', 'Adventures', 'He-Man', 'sets', 'present', 'first', 'three', '3-disc', 'sets', 'been', 'released', 'celebrating', 'impressive', '2002', 'Mike', 'Young', 'Productions', 'version', 'He-Man', 'Masters', 'Universe.I', ""'ve"", 'said', ""'ll"", 'say', 'again', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'happen', 'series', 'discovering', 'BCI', 'company', 'bringing', 'DVD', 'release', 'installment', 'exception', 'Included', '6-disc', 'compilation', 'are', 'following', 'episodes', 'Hunt', 'He-ManThe', 'Greatest', 'Show', 'EterniaNot', 'So', 'BlindRevenge', 'Never', 'SweetThe', 'Good', 'Shall', 'SurviveThe', 'Secret', 'GrayskullNo', 'Job', 'Too', 'SmallThe', 'Bitter', 'RoseThe', 'GamblerTeela', 'TriumphOrko', 'New', 'FriendThe', 'Problem', 'PowerDouble', 'TroubleThe', 'Eternia', 'FlowerHappy', 'Birthday', 'RobotoBattle', 'DragonsTime', 'Does', ""n't"", 'FlyHere', 'Skeletors', 'EverywhereBeauty', 'BeastOrko', 'ReturnVisitors', 'EarthMonster', 'MountainThe', 'Magic', 'FallsSearch', 'A', 'SonMistaken', 'IdentityThe', 'Toy', 'MakerBargin', 'EvilCapture', 'Comet', 'KeeperThe', 'Ancient', 'Mirror', 'AvatharThe', 'GamesTo', 'Save', 'CreaturesThe', 'Cold', 'ZoneExtras', 'are', 'once', 'again', 'abounding', 'sixth', 'disc', 'contains', 'inspiration', 'various', 'episodes', 'numbers', '99-130', 'facts', 'trivia', 'scripts', 'etc', 'Also', 'noteworthy', 'fantastic', 'conclusion', 'multi-part', 'Filmation', 'history', 'called', 'Animating', 'He-Man', 'Masters', 'Universe', 'Very', 'interesting', 'stuff', '3', 'episodes', 'contain', 'full', 'audio', 'commentary', 'always', 'BCI', 'pair', '4x6', 'collectible', 'art', 'cards', 'time', 'artists', 'Dan', 'Brereton', 'Mike', 'McKone']","He-Man and the Masters of the Universe - Season Two, Vol. 2"
