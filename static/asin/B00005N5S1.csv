The narritor's voice was monotone. I wanted to shout at his pompous, snobish demeanor SHUT UP!!  In my opinion is not the proper way to educate is to entertain at all god's peoples. With the narritor, granted he is educated but does he have to shove his creditals and his attitude from the gecko. When you take people on a educating journey (such as nine hours long) invite them like you would invite into a warm a loving welcoming home. I felt with his demeanor and atitude felt beat up and like I was crawling on my hands and knees through out the first two hours. I am not watching the rest of the seven hours and returning this DVD set back to the library and saying ""Check Please"".",1,I have got two words to descibes what I thought of this...,1112227200,"03 31, 2005",2005,782,"['IS', 'BORING', 'AND', 'SNOBISH', 'watched', 'first', 'two', 'hours', 'coud', ""n't"", 'keep', 'awake', 'narritor', 'voice', 'was', 'monotone', 'wanted', 'shout', 'pompous', 'snobish', 'demeanor', 'SHUT', 'UP', 'opinion', 'not', 'proper', 'way', 'educate', 'entertain', 'god', 'peoples', 'narritor', 'granted', 'educated', 'have', 'shove', 'creditals', 'attitude', 'gecko', 'When', 'take', 'people', 'educating', 'journey', 'such', 'nine', 'hours', 'long', 'invite', 'would', 'invite', 'warm', 'loving', 'welcoming', 'home', 'felt', 'demeanor', 'atitude', 'felt', 'beat', 'up', 'was', 'crawling', 'hands', 'knees', 'first', 'two', 'hours', 'am', 'not', 'watching', 'rest', 'seven', 'hours', 'returning', 'DVD', 'set', 'back', 'library', 'saying', 'Check', 'Please']",N/A
666641,A1G9FX1KV45N41,B00005N5S1,Gary Selikow,"[1, 2]","An impeccably created documentary on the four thousand remarkable people called the Jews, that have now returned to their ancient homeland, a narrated by the illustrious Abba Eban.The film is jam packed with footage of towns and ruins, monuments etc of the places under discussion in Israel, the Middle East and Europe. It is divided into 9 episodes , and provides the background history of the world in which the Jewish people found itself, the experiences of the Jews and their vast contribution to world civilization.Some very palpable points made such as the thousands year unbroken connection of the Jewish people with Jerusalem. With the destruction of the Temple Jerusalem retained a centrality in Jewish hearts and minds that never ended. He quotes Jewish scriptures : 'There is no wisdom like the wisdom of the Land of Israel. There is no beauty like the beauty of Jerusalem'.Jews lived in Jerusalem at various times during the two thousand year exile and there has been a Jewish majority in Jerusalem since the 1860s.A thin but continuous line of Jewish continuity , this digest illustrates remained in Jerusalem, Safed, Jaffa and Hebron, before the rebirth of the modern Zionist movement. Every one of the conquerors of the Holy Land had its origins elsewhere, Palestine was never the birthplace of any people other than the Jews, . The idea of Palestine as their homeland was neverPenetrating an analysis of Jew-hatred including those from so-called enlightened rulers and philosophers, begging the question today when Jew-hatred in the form of anti-Zionism (hatred of Israel and Israelis down to the last child) pervades governments, media, educational institutions , governments and NGOs and we have to ask now as in three hundred years ago, how those who claim to be enlightened can remain silent about this hatred in their midst.Episode 8 with harrowing footage takes us through the horrors of the Holocaust (Shoah) and the last Episode discusses the rebirth of The State of Israel, its conflicts, achievements and struggles to survive with beautiful footage of the land and people as well as the ruthless persecution of Jews in the Soviet Union and the situation of Jews today in the USA-their achievements and struggle for identity.",5,Excellent,1370908800,"06 11, 2013",2013,2250,"['impeccably', 'created', 'documentary', 'four', 'thousand', 'remarkable', 'people', 'called', 'Jews', 'have', 'now', 'returned', 'ancient', 'homeland', 'narrated', 'illustrious', 'Abba', 'Eban.The', 'film', 'jam', 'packed', 'footage', 'towns', 'ruins', 'monuments', 'etc', 'places', 'discussion', 'Israel', 'Middle', 'East', 'Europe', 'divided', '9', 'episodes', 'background', 'history', 'world', 'Jewish', 'people', 'found', 'experiences', 'Jews', 'vast', 'contribution', 'world', 'civilization.Some', 'very', 'palpable', 'points', 'made', 'such', 'thousands', 'year', 'unbroken', 'connection', 'Jewish', 'people', 'Jerusalem', 'destruction', 'Temple', 'Jerusalem', 'retained', 'centrality', 'Jewish', 'hearts', 'minds', 'never', 'ended', 'Jewish', 'scriptures', 'wisdom', 'wisdom', 'Land', 'Israel', 'beauty', 'beauty', ""Jerusalem'.Jews"", 'lived', 'Jerusalem', 'various', 'times', 'two', 'thousand', 'year', 'exile', 'been', 'Jewish', 'majority', 'Jerusalem', '1860s.A', 'thin', 'continuous', 'line', 'Jewish', 'continuity', 'digest', 'illustrates', 'remained', 'Jerusalem', 'Safed', 'Jaffa', 'Hebron', 'rebirth', 'modern', 'Zionist', 'movement', 'one', 'conquerors', 'Holy', 'Land', 'had', 'origins', 'elsewhere', 'Palestine', 'was', 'never', 'birthplace', 'people', 'other', 'Jews', 'idea', 'Palestine', 'homeland', 'was', 'neverPenetrating', 'analysis', 'Jew-hatred', 'including', 'so-called', 'enlightened', 'rulers', 'philosophers', 'begging', 'question', 'today', 'when', 'Jew-hatred', 'form', 'anti-Zionism', 'hatred', 'Israel', 'Israelis', 'down', 'last', 'child', 'governments', 'media', 'educational', 'institutions', 'governments', 'NGOs', 'have', 'ask', 'now', 'three', 'hundred', 'years', 'ago', 'how', 'who', 'claim', 'be', 'enlightened', 'can', 'remain', 'silent', 'hatred', 'midst.Episode', '8', 'harrowing', 'footage', 'horrors', 'Holocaust', 'Shoah', 'last', 'Episode', 'rebirth', 'State', 'Israel', 'conflicts', 'achievements', 'struggles', 'survive', 'beautiful', 'footage', 'land', 'people', 'as', 'well', 'ruthless', 'persecution', 'Jews', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'situation', 'Jews', 'today', 'USA-their', 'achievements', 'struggle', 'identity']",N/A
666642,A3QGRSZ7VTV0SY,B00005N5S1,Rabbi Yonassan Gershom,"[93, 98]","This DVD is a re-issue of a 9-hour mini-series that first aired in the 1980s, and was recently (Nov-Dec. 2001) aired again on PBS. Each segment is 1 hour long, making it a useful tool in history classes covering many different periods.  Since the &quot;history of civilization&quot; textbooks rarely mention what the Jews were doing in the 1900-year period between the rise of Christianity and the Nazi Holocaust, this series plays an important role in helping to make the curriculum more inclusive. Plus, The DVD version has a lot of additional resource materials not in the original PBS series.Regarding classroom appropriateness in public schools, this is a documentary, not a &quot;religion&quot; series. Yes, the series does talk about religion in some places, but it's called &quot;Civilization and the Jews&quot; for a reason. To be Jewish is not just a &quot;religion,&quot; it is also a culture, with its own art, music, literature, etc.  The approach is a mix of history, theology, archaeology, art, architecture, etc. that is intended to inform, not preach.  The series clearly shows how Jews have contributed to the various civilizations where they lived, and how, in turn, the Jews benefitted from interaction with many of the different cultures where the Jewish communities were located. Yes, it also covers the pesecutions of the Jews, but it's well-balanced with positive experiences and events.

It interesting that my 6 years old daughter was watching some parts with me and we both enjoyed. There are a lot of reasons to watch the program. First, it gives a good overview of the western civilization from sumerians. Second, the quality of the material is superb. You'll see a lot of beautiful places around the globe. Third, you'll learn about the jews.Some things are quite surpising. The program is focused on dates, places and events. It tells you what happened and where but not much about why. Also it doesn't tell much jewish religion or traditions. If you want to know about jewish holidays, what kosher is etc, you'll need to look for other sources.Overall, it's a great history program!",5,Recommeded!!!,1114560000,"04 27, 2005",2005,760,"['9', 'hours', 'watch', 'complete', 'set', 'worths', 'interesting', '6', 'years', 'old', 'daughter', 'was', 'watching', 'parts', 'enjoyed', 'are', 'lot', 'reasons', 'watch', 'program', 'First', 'good', 'overview', 'western', 'civilization', 'sumerians', 'Second', 'quality', 'material', 'superb', ""'ll"", 'see', 'lot', 'beautiful', 'places', 'globe', 'Third', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'jews.Some', 'things', 'are', 'quite', 'surpising', 'program', 'focused', 'dates', 'places', 'events', 'what', 'happened', 'where', 'not', 'much', 'why', 'Also', ""n't"", 'tell', 'much', 'jewish', 'religion', 'traditions', 'want', 'know', 'jewish', 'holidays', 'what', 'kosher', 'etc', ""'ll"", 'need', 'look', 'other', 'sources.Overall', 'great', 'history', 'program']",N/A

Instead he made a certain sacrifice and devoted his life to the cause of helping the Jewish state come into being and survive.This nine- part series is not concentrated on Israel but rather is a survey of Jewish civilization. Eban tries to show us how Jews interacted with the surrounding world, both learning and giving to the larger native socieities.
