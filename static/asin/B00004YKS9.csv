559401,A1YC9XEDFKXPLK,B00004YKS9,Armando M. Mesa,"[3, 4]","The only major key elements saving this comedy is Dangerfield's amazingly sarcastic humorous jokes and facial expressions,the lovely babes who play his wives, and the the tongue-in-cheek humor on a certain religion. Otherwise, the story is forgettable. Andrew Dice Clay again plays a typical role as memorable as his acting career.As for the story itself, it's about a construction developer from L.A. who purchases land in a Mormon town-community to build a ski-lodge resort. What he did not realize was that in bidding and gaining the land he would also inherit several wives from the previous landowner who has since passed away (it's a major part of the community's religious tradition). He,himself must also become a Mormon in order to join the township as a citizen to own the land.The rest involves crooked bankers/loan officers, mob king pins based in Las Vegas, and uptight conservative Mormon town folk...Despite all the films flaws, it's Rodney's humor that delivers every time. My only recommendation for any true die-hard Rodney Dangerfield fan is to skip this 100 minute flick and watch his stand up performances on the Jay Leno Show.At least on the Leno Show Rodney cuts to the chase and gets to his comedy gags !...This comedy flick rates 3 stars...One for Rodney,One for the babes, and One for some of the other miscellaneous antics and gag-jokes !",3,My 3 Stars...,975715200,"12 2, 2000",2000,1365,"['only', 'major', 'key', 'elements', 'saving', 'comedy', 'Dangerfield', 'amazingly', 'sarcastic', 'humorous', 'jokes', 'facial', 'expressions', 'lovely', 'babes', 'who', 'play', 'wives', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'humor', 'certain', 'religion', 'Otherwise', 'story', 'forgettable', 'Andrew', 'Dice', 'Clay', 'again', 'typical', 'role', 'as', 'memorable', 'acting', 'career.As', 'story', 'construction', 'developer', 'L.A.', 'who', 'purchases', 'land', 'Mormon', 'town-community', 'build', 'ski-lodge', 'resort', 'What', 'did', 'not', 'realize', 'was', 'bidding', 'gaining', 'land', 'would', 'also', 'inherit', 'several', 'wives', 'previous', 'landowner', 'who', 'passed', 'away', 'major', 'part', 'community', 'religious', 'tradition', 'must', 'also', 'become', 'Mormon', 'order', 'join', 'township', 'citizen', 'own', 'land.The', 'rest', 'crooked', 'bankers/loan', 'officers', 'mob', 'king', 'pins', 'based', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'uptight', 'conservative', 'Mormon', 'town', 'folk', 'films', 'flaws', 'Rodney', 'humor', 'time', 'only', 'recommendation', 'true', 'die-hard', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'fan', 'skip', '100', 'minute', 'flick', 'watch', 'stand', 'up', 'performances', 'Jay', 'Leno', 'Show.At', 'least', 'Leno', 'Show', 'Rodney', 'chase', 'comedy', 'gags', 'comedy', 'flick', 'rates', '3', 'stars', 'One', 'Rodney', 'One', 'babes', 'One', 'other', 'miscellaneous', 'antics', 'gag-jokes']",My Five Wives artisan

559403,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00004YKS9,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","I believe My 5 Wives is one of the funniest movies starring Rodney Dangerfield that I've seen yet.  I watched another Rodney movie where he went back to school (in fact, Back to School is the name of it) and Rodney's humor in that movie doesn't touch the more upbeat and hilarious style performed in My 5 Wives.  Perhaps there was some kind of restriction in place back in the mid 80's that wouldn't allow us to witness Rodney's *true* side (since My 5 Wives is clearly more joke-oriented).  Who knows.As you've probably figured out, the storyline is about Rodney becoming religious and specifically a polygamist.  He inherits 5 attractive women and basically takes over a small town with generous tips and charity donantions thanks to having the money to do so (thanks to a top-notch laywer and a divorce settlement that turns in his favor).  At first the townspeople accept him with open arms despite his offbeat, ""always quick to blurt out a witty remark"" style of humor but later on when they find out he's been spending counterfeit dollars (unintentionally unbeknownst to even Rodney) well, things change in a hurry.  My favorite part is probably when the girls take a trip to Las Vegas and turn into naughty girls!  The skiing/snowmobile segment at the end -despite being *extremely* exaggerated- is another high point.  Actually Rodney executes several hilarious lines while riding in the back of a garbage truck.I had no idea that was Andrew Dice Clay playing the role of the tough Italian guy, haha.  I forgot all about HIS style of comedy- more raunchy!  I recall his standup routines in the mid 90's and how my dad and his girlfriend were reluctant to let me watch them given my young age and the inappropriate topics he was discussing, but they ultimately gave in since I was a teenager at the time.I swear, Rodney's at the top of his game in this movie.  Without giving away the actual jokes, a certain one about holding open elevator doors, a false allegation involving his ex-wifes chest, terrible cooking and having to bring Tums for the ants, to the joke about stimulating the wrong female body parts... he's flat out *awesome* in this movie.I could seriously listen to Rodney's well-constructed style of humor all night long, haha.  I HIGHLY recommend My 5 Wives.

559405,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00004YKS9,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","MY 5 WIVES (Writ. Rodney Dangerfield, 2000, 100 minutes) left me surprised firstly because Dangerfield managed to do five more films plus two TV shows before his passing in 2004 (which left me weeping for days).This silly, straight-to-DVD-looking comedy tells the story of LA native Monte Peterson, a land developer eyeballing some prime land in Utah for a ski resort. Looking to bring jobs into the community, Monte finds a community made up of weird religious people - a sort of comedic blend of Amish and Mormon. Since the buyer of land left by a decedent also ""buys"" the deceased's wives, Monte finds himself having to marry three wives in order to finalize the deal.As ever, Dangerfield is game for the silliest of excuses to make his jokes on film. While nothing can ever really approach the genius of hisEasy Money, it's always fun to see anything with Dangerfield in it. Well, almost anything. This film has an odd significance just now because it is a clear stab at Mormonism, and we are days away from an election that could see a Mormon weirdo win the presidency. The film somehow bobs up and down comedically without being offensive to Mormonism. It does manage to be 100% offensive toward women.If you're a fan, then you'll like this and, as Dangerfield always plans, you'll roll your eyes in exasperation just when he wants you to - but he can still produce a great belly laugh when he wants to, his face as rubbery as ever.With the talents of Jerry Stiller, Andrew Dice Clay (I know, I was stunned too) and the great John Byner.",3,Let's go the whole inch-and-a-half,1351987200,"11 4, 2012",2012,1543,"['5', 'WIVES', 'Writ', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', '2000', '100', 'minutes', 'left', 'surprised', 'firstly', 'Dangerfield', 'managed', 'do', 'five', 'more', 'films', 'two', 'TV', 'shows', 'passing', '2004', 'left', 'weeping', 'days', '.This', 'silly', 'straight-to-DVD-looking', 'comedy', 'story', 'LA', 'native', 'Monte', 'Peterson', 'land', 'developer', 'eyeballing', 'prime', 'land', 'Utah', 'ski', 'resort', 'Looking', 'bring', 'jobs', 'community', 'Monte', 'community', 'made', 'weird', 'religious', 'people', 'sort', 'comedic', 'blend', 'Amish', 'Mormon', 'buyer', 'land', 'left', 'decedent', 'also', 'buys', 'deceased', 'wives', 'Monte', 'having', 'marry', 'three', 'wives', 'order', 'finalize', 'deal.As', 'ever', 'Dangerfield', 'game', 'silliest', 'excuses', 'make', 'jokes', 'film', 'nothing', 'can', 'ever', 'really', 'approach', 'genius', 'hisEasy', 'Money', 'always', 'fun', 'see', 'anything', 'Dangerfield', 'Well', 'almost', 'anything', 'film', 'odd', 'significance', 'just', 'now', 'clear', 'stab', 'Mormonism', 'are', 'days', 'away', 'election', 'could', 'see', 'Mormon', 'weirdo', 'win', 'presidency', 'film', 'somehow', 'bobs', 'comedically', 'being', 'offensive', 'Mormonism', 'manage', 'be', '100', '%', 'offensive', 'women.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'then', ""'ll"", 'like', 'Dangerfield', 'always', ""'ll"", 'roll', 'eyes', 'exasperation', 'just', 'when', 'can', 'still', 'produce', 'great', 'belly', 'laugh', 'when', 'face', 'as', 'rubbery', 'ever.With', 'talents', 'Jerry', 'Stiller', 'Andrew', 'Dice', 'Clay', 'know', 'was', 'stunned', 'too', 'great', 'John', 'Byner']",My Five Wives artisan

And what's funnier than having Rodney--the ""no respect"" guy--marrying five young & beautiful wives? It's a premise that's a gold mine of laughs! Rodney plays Monte Peterson, a real-estate contractor who comes across some prime land to build a ski lodge in Utah. The catch: In order to use his land, he has to join the Mormon religion...which automatically gives him his many wives! His purchase immediately raises the ire of a shifty banker (John Byner) who happens to be in a ""stronghold"" partnership with a Las Vegas gangster (Andrew Dice Clay, beautifully cast) who has a secret land scheme that will turn the community upside-down. But Peterson's got his own problems: A trip to Vegas to treat his wives goes awry when both the city's fast living & a gung-ho feminist author (Molly Shannon) quickly corrupt the girls, opening up their eyes to women's lib. Worse, Byner sends his portly minion to Vegas in hopes of catching Peterson smoking or drinking as proof to ex-communicate him.Rodney's likable & in top form in this one, rattling off some terrific one-liners, and getting into mischief as usual. The one flaw is the action sequences. The jail breakout, with Rodney riding in a trash bin, has some obvious stunt double work; and the ski chase is marred with stunt work that's obviously not Rodney.

That somehow includes taking three wives, and they become five.
