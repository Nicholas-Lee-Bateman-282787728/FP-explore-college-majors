The only reason I went to see this movie was because a friend wanted to. She was really excited to see it and even she walked out disappointed. I went in with extremely low expectations and I was STILL disappointed.

I didn't think it was the best of the series but still was a good spoof on some of the latest horror films. I agree about the other review how it had a different tone and had more dark humor in it. It mainly focuses on Paranormal Activity but also quite a bit on Black Swan, Mama and Rise Of the Planet Of The Apes. I can't believe how many people dislike the Scary Movie franchise, I even find it a bit underrated. It's not a masterpiece but just great dumb, hilarious spoofs.

But not as horrible as I expected! It's even worse.The movie makes ""Movie 43"" or ""Disaster Movie"" look like master pieces! And the fact that they obviously tried to replace Cindy and Brenda with bad copies for potential sixth and seventh parts(Jody and Kendra) made it sink. Ashley and Erica tried too hard to be funny, while Anna and Regina didn't had to try a lot. I just wish Dimension would had waited for Anna Faris (she was pregnant at the time this was filmed), because perhaps, the movie with her would had been WAY better. No one can replace Cindy and Brenda! There's no Scary Movie without them. Also, Simon Rex's performance was painful to watch. He should quit acting. If he thinks he was funny in this movie, well he's not! All the funny moments of the movie are seen on the trailer, the other ones are just the typical physical humor jokes or tasteless comedy. At least the other Scary Movies were stupid and with physical humor sometimes, but they were funny!Another thing that annoyed me is that they parodied more drama movies/TV shows than horror movies (isn't Scary Movie known for parodying HORROR movies?).

If that terrifying image is not enough to scare you off, read on!This movie mostly spoofs the horror movie ""Mama""  - so if you want to get the most out of Scary Movie 5, be sure to watch the movie ""Mama"" first.  Scary Movie 5 also loosely spoofs Planet of the Apes (the current one, of course) and Black Swan.  (I didn't see Black Swan, but I don't think that really mattered).Anyhoo.....did I enjoy the movie?  Well, I suppose in a way...I did get some laughs out of it....it wasn't boring....and YET....something didn't quite feel right.I think this particular installation in the Scary Movie series had a darker humor to it than the others.  Also, this movie does not have Anna Farris...the nave bumbling lovable star of all the other Scary movies...and THAT I think, is where it fails the most.Anna Farris had a charming innocence about her...she was, basically, a nice person, and you rooted for her as the main character.  Now we have Ashley Tisdale as the ""star"" - and she is not likable at all.  Not that I blame her - it's the writing that's at fault, of course.  But she plays a sort of trashy, unlikable, unfriendly person who you really DON'T root for, at all.  And this, I believe, is the main reason why the movie just doesn't have the same ""feel"" as the others.A lot of the humor is indeed the same in Scary Movie 5 as in the other Scary Movies - (***WARNING***: This movie is NOT for young children - plenty of sexual references!!!).  So yes, there is definitely humor - just no Anna Farris.Should you see the movie?  Sure, it's worth seeing at least once - especially if you are a fan of the series.

1645148,A27F1WYCM6IEYH,B00CAATSME,Colten,"[3, 5]","""Scary Movie 5"" must be some kind of psychological experiment. Perhaps the filmmakers sat in a lab, rubbing their temples while wondering aloud how awful they could make a movie and still score at the box office.It's the only reasonable explanation for this lazy, boring, vile and tragically unfunny attempt at a horror-film spoof that is sure to kill brain cells and may signal the impending apocalypse. It's the kind of movie that leaves audience members partially lobotomized, exiting the theater and muttering absently to themselves, ""How on earth did this movie get made?""The answer: cheaply. Each of the increasingly terrible ""Scary Movie"" installments has enjoyed an impressive return on investment, so it's only logical that producers want to keep making them, quite literally, ad nauseam. The cost-cutting is evident, between the not-so-special effects and the amateur editing errors, including a casual relationship between dialogue and moving mouths.Thirteen years after the first ""Scary Movie,"" this new chapter follows the same general template, with one exception: This incarnation kicks off with Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan, playing themselves, preparing to make a sex tape.From there, the story skips to couple Dan and Jody, who inherit a trio of youngsters after the demise of the kids' dad. What follows shouldn't be confused with a plot; it's more a series of snippets in which the characters borrow familiar story lines from other movies, including ""Mama,"" ""Inception,"" ""Black Swan"" and ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes.""But ""Scary Movie"" doesn't really put any kind of twist on these familiar plots, so much as present them in some brainless context. But stupid doesn't necessarily equate to funny, and that goes for Heather Locklear, dressed as a pregnant ballerina whose water breaks all over a male dancer's face as he lifts her above his head.The movie is so appalling that even a film fan who guffawed her way through ""The Aristocrats"" would feel nothing but a deep emptiness as the end credits begin to roll, wondering if one solid joke was too much to ask from a movie that bills itself as comedy.But no, there's nothing worthy of even a small smirk. Instead, the movie serves up violence against man, woman, child, doll and ape, not to mention sexual situations involving a German shepherd, a hairy, overweight nanny, Santa Claus, an automatic swimming pool cleaner, a pony and a microwave. A knock-knock joke told by a 6-year-old would be funnier than this endless stream of flatulence jokes, feces-infused food items and gratuitous vomiting.For some reason, watching this movie kept conjuring up the voice of Smokey Bear intoning ""Only YOU can prevent forest fires.""

1645155,ACW4P33TPKDWW,B00CAATSME,Drew from Oregon,"[1, 3]","I was fortunate enough to receive a copy of Scary Movie V for review.  Here it is:We are all familiar with the silliness of the Scary Movie franchise, so one would think we already know what we are getting ourselves into before viewing another Scary Movie installment; however, what we get with Scary Movie V is really just immature and juvenile slap-stick comedy.Scary Movie V has its moments where I actually laughed out loud at a few things, but then the movie seemed to just keep dragging on and repeating a lot of the same stuff, i.e., when someone gets hit in the head with pots and pans.  Usually, a comedy is supposed to move fast and keep you laughing throughout most of the movie, not making you beg for it to be over.  Clocking in at 88 minutes long, Scary Movie V was just too long of a movie and should have been only cut down to 30 minutes as that's about when it started to lose its luster.Some of the movies that were parodied in this installment were Black Swan, Paranormal Activity, The Cabin in the Woods, and Inception among others.  We even see a Fifty Shades of Grey parody in the movie, which was interesting, but many people probably wouldn't get the joke if they haven't read the book.  Although Scary Movie V has an all-star cast of comedians who have been part of some extremely funny movies in the past like Charlie Sheen, Katt Williams, Molly Shannon, Mike Tyson, and Snoop Dogg among a whole list of others, it still wasn't enough to save this movie from being such a train wreck.Overall, Scary Movie V was just an okay comedy movie.  It certainly isn't one of the better movies in the Scary Movie franchise and probably shouldn't have even been made.  Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of the Scary Movie series, I even like the fourth one as well, and that's probably where it should have stopped.  I give Scary Movie V an overall rating of 2/5 stars because, although it was a disaster, I still got some pretty good laughs out of it within the first 30 minutes of the movie.  Some people like this kind of comedy, and I do as well, but it just dragged on too much throughout this film.  Scary Movie V is definitely worth checking out yourself so you can make your own judgment.Overall Rating:  2/5 starsSpecial Features:Deleted and Extended Scenes",2,Not the Best Scary Movie Installment,1376870400,"08 19, 2013",2013,2282,"['was', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'receive', 'copy', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'V', 'review', 'Here', 'are', 'familiar', 'silliness', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'franchise', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'already', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'viewing', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'installment', 'however', 'what', 'get', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'V', 'really', 'just', 'immature', 'juvenile', 'slap-stick', 'comedy.Scary', 'Movie', 'V', 'moments', 'where', 'actually', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'few', 'things', 'then', 'movie', 'seemed', 'just', 'keep', 'dragging', 'repeating', 'lot', 'same', 'stuff', 'i.e.', 'when', 'someone', 'hit', 'head', 'pots', 'pans', 'Usually', 'comedy', 'supposed', 'move', 'fast', 'keep', 'laughing', 'most', 'movie', 'not', 'making', 'beg', 'be', 'Clocking', '88', 'minutes', 'long', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'V', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'long', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'only', 'cut', 'down', '30', 'minutes', 'when', 'started', 'lose', 'luster.Some', 'movies', 'were', 'parodied', 'installment', 'were', 'Black', 'Swan', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'Inception', 'others', 'even', 'see', 'Fifty', 'Shades', 'Grey', 'parody', 'movie', 'was', 'interesting', 'many', 'people', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'joke', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'V', 'all-star', 'cast', 'comedians', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'part', 'extremely', 'funny', 'movies', 'past', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'Katt', 'Williams', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'whole', 'list', 'others', 'still', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'save', 'movie', 'being', 'such', 'train', 'wreck.Overall', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'V', 'was', 'just', 'okay', 'comedy', 'movie', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'one', 'better', 'movies', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'franchise', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'even', 'been', 'made', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'series', 'even', 'fourth', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'probably', 'where', 'should', 'have', 'stopped', 'give', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'V', 'overall', 'rating', '2/5', 'stars', 'because', 'was', 'disaster', 'still', 'got', 'pretty', 'good', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'movie', 'people', 'kind', 'comedy', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'dragged', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'V', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'so', 'can', 'make', 'own', 'judgment.Overall', 'Rating', '2/5', 'starsSpecial', 'Features', 'Deleted', 'Extended', 'Scenes']",Scary Movie 5

The first two (and arguably even the third film) in the Scary Movie film series were entertaining. Riffing on famous films with low brow humor, they were absolutely hilarious. However, this is not at all near the calibre of those films. In those previous films, there'd be one film parodied with slight nods to other franchises in a humorous manner. However, in this one - SPOILERS - there is no plot. It's just haphazard attempt to parody numerous movies that were out in 2009. So not only is this film 3-4 years too late, it just flat out IS NOT FUNNY.It was a painful movie to watch and even worst to think about after the fact.

1645159,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00CAATSME,FNDNreview,"[6, 10]","Let's do the bottom line first:  parody films are the scourge of the film world.  The comedy parody is the cheapest, most worthless form of entertainment in all of film.  Quite simply, they give movie-making a bad name and simply try to cash in the success of other films.  Now, this particular response is mainly due in large part to the abysmal, horrendous parody films in recent memory  - including, but not limited to Movie 43, The 41-Year-Old Virgin Who Knocked Up Sarah Marshall and Felt Superbad About It, and A Haunted House.  Now, that's not to say all parody films are bad.  On the contrary, that are are select few parody films that a classics - including Spaceballs, Hot Shots!, The Naked Gun, and Scary Movie.  Does the original Scary Movie film belong in that club?  The honest answer is probably not yet (give it more time to appreciate in value), however, if you compared the massively successful Scary Movie to newest sequel in the series, Scary Movie 5, you'll see exactly how far the franchise has fallen in terms of quality.Typically, this is where the synopsis for the film enters the review - but when you're dealing with a parody film, there's absolutely no plot to be had.  From beginning to end, Scary Movie 5 mainly attempts to follow the Paranormal Activity plot-line where there is an evil presence in a ""normal"" suburban home and the residents try to videotape the evil inhabitants.  However, Scary Movie constantly veers off course to mock various other films, including Black Swan, Evil Dead, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and Inception.  Although this film is technically a sequel, previous main cast members Anna Faris and Brenda Meeks exit the franchise and make way for Ashley Tisdale and Erica Ash.  However, Charlie Sheen (briefly) and Molly Shannon both return after stints in previous sequels.There's really no other way to say this:  Scary Movie 5 is not funny.  For a film to be labeled a comedy, one would assume there's laughing involved.  Easily the worst in the series, Scary Movie 5 completely misses the mark, often trying too hard to create something out of nothing.  If you saw the trailer and thought there might be some hope for the film, you're not alone.  The problem is Scary Movie 5 is one of those films that used all of its best moments in the trailer - including the brief appearance by Charlie Sheen and Lindsey Lohan, both of whom are only in the opening scene and were obviously brought in to tastelessly dupe people into falsely buying tickets for the movie.  Not only were they strictly in the opening scene, but there is absolutely nothing to take away from that scene, other than the sad state of their personal lives.  Sheen shows off his sex tape collection, while Lohan goes on and on about her court date the following morning.  It's a completely lackluster and disappointing interaction between the two, especially since the general public is already mostly aware of their constant battles with the legal system - and virtually don't care anymore.It's often hard to find a silver lining in a parody film, but if one exists in Scary Movie 5, it has to be the acting of Ashley Tisdale.  Surprisingly, she plays her part well - even if she is less effective than the absent Anna Faris.  It was announced relatively early that Faris would not be returning to the franchise (and who can blame her), but Scary Movie 5 was obviously written with the assumption that the Faris/Meeks tandem would be reprising their roles.  For the diehard Scary Movie fans (assuming they exist somewhere), it's a pretty devastating blow to be without Anna Faris, the face of the franchise, for the first time - yet, Scary Movie 5 almost feels like a parody of a parody with Tisdale/Ash doing their best Faris/Meeks impressions.Occasionally, there are brief moments of sunlight in this monumentally dull film.  In one particular scene, the main lead - Ashley Tisdale treats her cell phone as a means to discover whether or not she's pregnant by using an ""I-Preggers App"" - which she urinates on, and then immediately answers an incoming call.  While the scene isn't overly amusing, it does serve its purpose to make fun of the way society relies on smartphones to give us the majority of our information.  Oddly enough, Scary Movie 5 has far too many of these smart moments and not enough laugh-out-loud funny moments, with the majority of its cracks being either too dimwitted or too intelligent for their own good.  Either way, the film suffers greatly due its complacency.Overall, the Scary Movie franchise continues to struggle without the Wayans brothers - and even more so due to the restriction of a PG-13 rating, which the franchise adopted for Scary Movie 3 and beyond.  The film is filled with an endless amount of sex, drug, and celebrity references, and even though the film was able to attain a PG-13 rating, it's still unsuitable for kids and simply mind-baffling how a film of this nature wasn't given an R-rating.  Do yourself a favor and skip this film at all cost - and if you have kids, make sure they skip it, too.Overall Film Grade:  D-FNDNreview.com",1,Filmmaking at its worst in 'Scary Movie

Lee (The Soul Men, The Best Man) took a formula story of parody with characters originally created by Marlon and Shawn Wayans, Aaron Seltzer and others - and a final script by Pat Proft (Real Genius, Police Squad) and David Zucker (Airplane, The Naked Gun) and had some fun making fun of films like `The Help', The Cabin In The Woods', Paranormal Activity, Black Swan and `Rise of the Planet of the apes'.As the fifth in the line, the comedy is simple and the jokes are always not as obvious, but in `Scary Movie 5' its Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan who have a really funny opening scene of making of a `sex tape' of themselves. Without saying too much, it literally goes over the top and both Charlie and Lindsay obviously have no problem making fun of themselves as well. It is probably the best bit in the film.Ashley Tisdale (High School Musical, Suite Life) and Simon Rex (Scary Movie 1,2,3 & 4) play a mother and father who obvious have a house with issues. The movie centers around the two of them realizing and then dealing with the `ghostlike' problem the house is having. People like Snoop Dogg, Mike Tyson, Mac Miller, Big Ang and Sharee Whitefield all make cameo appearance of themselves. All are exaggerated, but definitely making fun of themselves.Overall it's a video movie for me because the previous films were a little funnier to me and had more gags.

1645185,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B00CAATSME,Micheal Hunt,"[0, 1]","So we wait for years for a 5th movie and when it finally comes out, we get a few laughs, but in the end, overall it's the weakest of all the series. Many said 3 and 4 where bad because the Wayans brothers did not create them, but I think people appreciate them more now because they realize who actually made those and what parodies he was involved with many years ago. It does take 3 to make a classic, true, but on his own with new friends at the plate, 3 and 4 has been seen as different to the first 2, but in there own way, a great part of the whole franchise. This time around however Zucker decided to kick back and let someone else take the helm. Although he was still involved, I think this movie clearly shows where and what he was involved in compared to the other guy who's claim to fame was ""Undercover Brother"".Plot: HAHA, if you can call it one. Charlie Sheen himself dies and his kids go missing in the woods. His brother gets word they are found and brought back to society, but they have gone rabid and brought Mama back with them. End Plot. I think the first thing that has confused people is that Sheen has been in parts 3 & 4, and was killed off in 4. But now he is back, but not playing a character, he is playing himself. His supposed real life brother is played by Simon Rex who played his brother in Scary Movie 3 & 4 but is now playing someone else who is supposed to be his real brother, but only in the film. It's kind of confusing for some, but I suppose if you can look at the logic that Star Wars 1, 2 & 3 are actually 4, 5 & 6 and 4, 5, & 6 are really 1,2 & 3, and now that Disney have the franchise, they will make parts 7, 8 and 9 which are really going to be 10, 11 & 12 to avoid any confusion about it. Anyway, no one seemed to mind when one of the Wayans was killed in the first Scary Movie and was one of the killers in the end, but came back alive in the second movie like nothing happened. So it's not the first time the franchise has done this. Oh, and Brenda was killed in every movie. Kind of like a Kenny from South Park thing. Only now the names have been changed to shame the guilty.Anyway, enough jibber-jabber. This film takes a spoof on Paranormal Activity and Mama for the most part. Throw in Black Swan, The Evil Dead and Inception and you have Scary Movie part 5. There is some good stuff in this movie. I actually saw this before I saw Mama and Evil Dead, and it did cause me to laugh at those scenes once I realized what they where making fun of. It's not all that bad of a movie, worthy of seeing once at least, and it does actually have a much better ending than Mama in my opinion.I think what let so many people down was the expected Anna Farris to at least make an appearance. Well, she was written into it, but could not do it due to pregnancy.

The familiar cast of characters and any pretense of plot continuity have been flushed down the proverbial celluloid toilet in favor of a new cast of unlikable characters and no real plot to speak of. They don't even seem to have stuck to the premise of just making fun of ""scary"" movies anymore. Now, the targets are any movie that they think they can get a cheap laugh out of. For the most part, it doesn't work.The whole segment with Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan falls totally flat. Lohan (pre-rehab) just comes off as more of a bad actress than a comedian. Sheen simply isn't given any decent material to work with. Throw-in some cameos by Snoop Dog/Snoop Lion and lots of other celebrities that can't act and you get a mish-mash of half-assed comedy sketches that normally would not rate enough laughs to make it as a sketch on Saturday Night Live.The film did have its moments at times, but as soon as it felt like things were starting to turn around another round of bad acting, bad writing and lack of any interest at all in the main characters would bring everything to a screeching halt. Based upon the previous movies in the series, I really wanted to like this movie. I'll give it two stars for the director, cast and crew trying to make the best of a bad situation (i.e. the script, loss of main characters, having to work with Lindsay Lohan, etc.).
