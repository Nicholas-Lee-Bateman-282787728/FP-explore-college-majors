1434964,A11MGPEYU3VO1U,B004ZOF48U,Keith Niemeyer,"[12, 15]","My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.There are about 12 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer, a pot handle at 15% and the same leaf at 20% 4 times in a brief period.The in-screen 3D is vivid but pushed to the limits most of the time. Pushing the 3D to the limit for an object at 1 depth seems to have caused MINOR 3D defects at other depths 13 times. Additionally, 10 times there were easily noticeable 3D flaws in the background. Don't get me wrong, this film is a keeper as long as you don't mind the lack of OOS effects. With more (3D) camera time and better stereographing, I expect some awesome 3D from Asylum in their future.MY 3D RATING = GOOD to VERY GOOD, 3 1/2 stars (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing.

This movie was actually shot in native 3d and the 3d is EXCELLENT. Although it's not about popping out at you mostly , it's about depth mainly, still many 3d flicks were shot in 2d and then processed and will never look as good as this one does, other than a few titles , this is TRUE 3D. The movie which was shot on a low budget (ohter than the 3d)  in California , is a average haunted house movie , and it's actually alot better than most asylum titles! (the company that made this one).
