Girl has some tough choices to make.This story just draws you in from the very beginning.  While it is simple it is no less intriguing for its simplicity.  I watched it every time it came on MTV and every person that I know that has ever seen this film had the same attraction to the characters.The love between these two is steamy and intense without having to run the kids out of the room.  It's a great story with a hopeful message for humanity:  ""It's best to see the person and not the ""label"" and let your heart decide.""",5,A love story for the new millenium,1017446400,"03 30, 2002",2002,609,"['Boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'girl', 'betrothed', 'Boy', 'new', 'world', 'girl', 'Girl', 'tough', 'choices', 'make.This', 'story', 'just', 'draws', 'very', 'beginning', 'simple', 'less', 'intriguing', 'simplicity', 'watched', 'time', 'came', 'MTV', 'person', 'know', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'had', 'same', 'attraction', 'characters.The', 'love', 'two', 'steamy', 'intense', 'having', 'run', 'kids', 'room', 'great', 'story', 'hopeful', 'message', 'humanity', 'best', 'see', 'person', 'not', 'label', 'let', 'heart', 'decide']",Love Song VHS

696070,A3U5JCXIXTGSLN,B000063UTS,musiclover13,"[9, 9]","When I first heard about this movie, I was definitely skeptical. I had seen my fair share of singers trying to be actresses, so I wanted to see for myself if Monica could pull off a starring role.For the most part, I thought the story was very nice. Monica did a pretty good job with her acting. However, there were moments where her emotions seemed forced - almost as if she was trying too hard. Christian Kane did an excellent job as her love interest even though I wish his character would have been developed a little more.Overall, this is a pretty good movie. It was nice to see a movie about an interracial couple where things turned out for the good and the characters didn't let society and their families determine their happiness.",3,Pretty Good,1049068800,"03 31, 2003",2003,740,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'movie', 'was', 'definitely', 'skeptical', 'had', 'seen', 'fair', 'share', 'singers', 'trying', 'be', 'actresses', 'wanted', 'see', 'Monica', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'starring', 'most', 'part', 'thought', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'Monica', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'acting', 'However', 'were', 'moments', 'where', 'emotions', 'seemed', 'forced', 'almost', 'was', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'Christian', 'Kane', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'love', 'interest', 'even', 'wish', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'developed', 'little', 'more.Overall', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'movie', 'interracial', 'couple', 'where', 'things', 'turned', 'out', 'good', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'society', 'families', 'determine', 'happiness']",Love Song VHS
