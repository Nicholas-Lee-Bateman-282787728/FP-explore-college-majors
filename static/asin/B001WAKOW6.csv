Many people like this. I happen to think it takes away from the potential of many of these types of movies. This is the story of a hard-charging female management type from Florida who is sent by her company to Minnesota in order to lay people off and re-organize the factory. Of course she goes in the middle of the winter so we have the jarring weather along with the culture shock of being in a Minnesota. The movie includes a number of stock situations for movies like this and very little that is innovative or fresh. I think the two main characters have a bit of chemistry, but they never seem to be put in situations where it can develop much. Whenever they end up together, something else usually happens to change the focus of the action. Finally, the ending is a feel-good finale. In any case, if you like the kind of movie in which a proud city person ends up learning lessons from rural folk, you might like this movie. If you are looking for a really good romantic movie, you should probably temper your expectations.",3,Typical nice but weak romantic movie,1266019200,"02 13, 2010",2010,1177,"['one', 'fish-out-of-water', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'up', 'stereotypes', 'exaggerates', 'things', 'name', 'being', 'funny', 'cute', 'Many', 'people', 'happen', 'think', 'away', 'potential', 'many', 'types', 'movies', 'story', 'hard-charging', 'female', 'management', 'type', 'Florida', 'who', 'sent', 'company', 'Minnesota', 'order', 'lay', 'people', 're-organize', 'factory', 'course', 'middle', 'winter', 'have', 'jarring', 'weather', 'culture', 'shock', 'being', 'Minnesota', 'movie', 'number', 'stock', 'situations', 'movies', 'very', 'little', 'innovative', 'fresh', 'think', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'bit', 'chemistry', 'never', 'seem', 'be', 'put', 'situations', 'where', 'can', 'develop', 'much', 'Whenever', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'something', 'else', 'usually', 'change', 'focus', 'action', 'Finally', 'ending', 'feel-good', 'finale', 'case', 'like', 'kind', 'movie', 'proud', 'city', 'person', 'up', 'learning', 'lessons', 'rural', 'folk', 'might', 'like', 'movie', 'are', 'looking', 'really', 'good', 'romantic', 'movie', 'should', 'probably', 'temper', 'expectations']",New In Town
1244680,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001WAKOW6,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","One of those pointless romantic comedies, `New in Town' has absolutely nothing in it that sets it apart from the rest of the pack.  The acting is mediocre, at time excruciatingly amateur, and that script is so cookie cutter that it borrows so much from other, better films to create a complete waste of time.And yet I'm compelled to give this two stars for the mere fact that I did laugh kind of hard a few times.Lucy Hill is a Miami businesswoman who gets transferred to a small town in Minnesota in order to whip a plant into shape.  She is not given a warm welcome, as the townsfolk know with her she brings layoffs, but what starts off rocky soon becomes smooth as Lucy warms up to Ted, the local Union Officer, not to mention Blanche, her secretary.  Of course, it can't stay smooth for long, especially once her corporate office makes some abrupt changes in her plans.  But, have no worries; like every movie it steals its many scenes from, there is a happy (and very sappy) ending in store for us.My issue is that nothing here is fresh, exciting or noteworthy.Except Harry Connick Jr.I credit every funny scene in this film to Connick Jr., an actor I used to kind of hate but who has lately made me take a double take (his work in 07's `Bug' was extraordinary).  He is funny, charming and totally natural here, even when everyone around him is nothing more than an over-emphasized stereotype.  He stands out, not just because everyone else is horrible, but because he is BETTER THAN THIS MOVIE.Zellweger used to be so lovely.  Remember when she waded through `Bridget Jones' movies with spunk and sweetened naturalism?  Remember when she blew us all away with her beautifully charming breakthrough in `Jerry Maguire'?  Remember her sizzle through `Chicago'?  WHERE IS THAT GIRL!?!?  I miss her.  Her she is nothing, truly NOTHING.  Her squished face barely registers an emotion through this entire film.  In fact, the only scene she nails is the one where she plays drunk.  Siobhan Fallon is really nothing but a carbon copy of a `Fargo' character, yet without the intelligence that the Coen brothers brought to their characters.  J.K. Simmons is a great character actor, but his accent is so iffy that he really loses points here.  I will say that the weight and the beard suit him (he should think about getting fat) but aside from that he was absolutely pointless.Why does every one of these films containing a diner waitress name her Flo?Skip this one.  Really.  Stay away.  It's sad, because I really liked Connick Jr.'s performance and want to say ""watch this for him"" but even he is not worth suffering through the rest of this film for.  My wife even said about halfway through; ""is this torture for you too?"" and the answer was ""yes"", but I have this thing where I need to finish what I start, even if the only reason is to tear it apart the next day in a review!",2,Nothing new in this town...,1259020800,"11 24, 2009",2009,2879,"['One', 'pointless', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'New', 'Town', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'apart', 'rest', 'pack', 'acting', 'mediocre', 'time', 'excruciatingly', 'amateur', 'script', 'so', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'so', 'much', 'other', 'better', 'films', 'create', 'complete', 'waste', 'time.And', 'yet', ""'m"", 'compelled', 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'mere', 'fact', 'did', 'laugh', 'kind', 'hard', 'few', 'times.Lucy', 'Hill', 'Miami', 'businesswoman', 'who', 'transferred', 'small', 'town', 'Minnesota', 'order', 'whip', 'plant', 'shape', 'not', 'given', 'warm', 'welcome', 'townsfolk', 'know', 'layoffs', 'what', 'off', 'rocky', 'soon', 'becomes', 'smooth', 'Lucy', 'up', 'Ted', 'local', 'Union', 'Officer', 'not', 'mention', 'Blanche', 'secretary', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stay', 'smooth', 'long', 'especially', 'once', 'corporate', 'office', 'abrupt', 'changes', 'plans', 'have', 'worries', 'movie', 'many', 'scenes', 'happy', 'very', 'sappy', 'ending', 'store', 'us.My', 'issue', 'nothing', 'here', 'fresh', 'exciting', 'noteworthy.Except', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.I', 'credit', 'funny', 'scene', 'film', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'actor', 'used', 'kind', 'hate', 'who', 'lately', 'made', 'take', 'double', 'take', 'work', '07', 'Bug', 'was', 'extraordinary', 'funny', 'charming', 'totally', 'natural', 'here', 'even', 'when', 'everyone', 'nothing', 'more', 'over-emphasized', 'stereotype', 'out', 'not', 'just', 'everyone', 'else', 'horrible', 'BETTER', 'THAN', 'THIS', 'MOVIE.Zellweger', 'used', 'be', 'so', 'lovely', 'Remember', 'when', 'waded', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'movies', 'spunk', 'sweetened', 'naturalism', 'Remember', 'when', 'blew', 'away', 'beautifully', 'charming', 'breakthrough', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'Remember', 'sizzle', 'Chicago', 'WHERE', 'THAT', 'GIRL', 'miss', 'nothing', 'truly', 'NOTHING', 'squished', 'face', 'barely', 'emotion', 'entire', 'film', 'fact', 'only', 'scene', 'one', 'where', 'drunk', 'Siobhan', 'Fallon', 'really', 'nothing', 'carbon', 'copy', 'Fargo', 'character', 'yet', 'intelligence', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'brought', 'characters', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'great', 'character', 'actor', 'accent', 'so', 'iffy', 'really', 'points', 'here', 'will', 'say', 'weight', 'beard', 'suit', 'should', 'think', 'getting', 'fat', 'aside', 'was', 'absolutely', 'pointless.Why', 'one', 'films', 'containing', 'diner', 'waitress', 'name', 'Flo', 'Skip', 'one', 'Really', 'Stay', 'away', 'sad', 'really', 'liked', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'performance', 'want', 'say', 'watch', 'even', 'not', 'worth', 'suffering', 'rest', 'film', 'My', 'wife', 'even', 'said', 'halfway', 'torture', 'too', 'answer', 'was', 'yes', 'have', 'thing', 'where', 'need', 'finish', 'what', 'start', 'even', 'only', 'reason', 'tear', 'apart', 'next', 'day', 'review']",New In Town

Renee Zellweger plays headstrong businesswoman/amateur outdoors-gal Lucy Hill, and she's sent to a small town in Minnesota to make some changes at one of her employer's factories. She gets more than she bargained for when she meets Ted, played by the ruggedly handsome Harry Connick Jr., and a town full of likable folks who are so nice they even leave their keys in their cars in case a friend OR a stranger needs to make quick use of it. The Minnesotan accents of the townspeople were too cute, and I especially loved the scrapbooking characters. They made me want to be a scrapper myself. This movie was almost like one of those cheesy, cozy novels you pick up to keep you warm by the fire during winter. Harry Connick Jr. and Renee Zellweger had great chemistry. I especially loved the crow hunting excursion when Ted just about flipped Lucy upside down trying to help her get her zipper unstuck on her jumpsuit.

Alas it was not meant to be.The idea of a glamorous city executive (Zellweger) coming to a small town to downsize a company and butting heads with the local union rep (HCJ) is an excellent one. There was so much potential here for a really sharp romantic comedy, but it basically fell completely flat. Why? IMO because it didn't want to tackle the real issues surrounding downsizing and corporate greed, so it went the way of condescending stereotypes and tired romcom cliches.Zellweger goes from being a brittle corporate drone to someone with a conscience in the blink of an eye, and there are only a few lame scenes with her & HCJ before they are in lurve. There's no sparring or witty repartee to draw the reader in, or any attempt to build sexual tension. The dialogue is unbelievable and the film consists of very short scenes that don't allow you to connect with the characters. The icy landscape is very fitting because Zellweger's face is frozen throughout the entire movie, but maybe that was through embarassment at being in such a dud, and not a botox treatment gone wrong.",1,Disappointing,1345420800,"08 20, 2012",2012,1168,"[""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'HCJ', 'was', 'expecting', 'lot', 'film', 'Alas', 'was', 'not', 'meant', 'be.The', 'idea', 'glamorous', 'city', 'executive', 'Zellweger', 'coming', 'small', 'town', 'downsize', 'company', 'butting', 'heads', 'local', 'union', 'rep', 'HCJ', 'excellent', 'one', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'here', 'really', 'sharp', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'basically', 'fell', 'completely', 'flat', 'Why', 'IMO', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'tackle', 'real', 'issues', 'surrounding', 'downsizing', 'corporate', 'greed', 'went', 'way', 'condescending', 'stereotypes', 'tired', 'romcom', 'cliches.Zellweger', 'being', 'brittle', 'corporate', 'drone', 'someone', 'conscience', 'blink', 'eye', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'lame', 'scenes', 'HCJ', 'are', 'lurve', 'sparring', 'witty', 'repartee', 'draw', 'reader', 'attempt', 'build', 'sexual', 'tension', 'dialogue', 'unbelievable', 'film', 'very', 'short', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'allow', 'connect', 'characters', 'icy', 'landscape', 'very', 'fitting', 'Zellweger', 'face', 'frozen', 'entire', 'movie', 'maybe', 'was', 'embarassment', 'being', 'dud', 'not', 'botox', 'treatment', 'gone', 'wrong']",New In Town

1244700,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001WAKOW6,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 4]","""New in Town"" is both a romantic comedy and a fish-out-of-water story, setups so overused that they've pretty much lost all credibility. I will not go so far as to say that this is a bad film; in fact, it redeems itself to a degree with a subplot involving corporate greed and harsh economic realities, which could not be timelier. But as far as the romantic comedy stuff is concerned, this movie gives as absolutely nothing new, and it showed no ambition to do so. It's typical boy-and-girl-from-two-different-worlds material, with an executive from sunny Miami and a blue-collar union representative from snowy New Ulm, Minnesota crossing paths and hitting it off. Even more typical is the fact that, initially, the two can't stand each other, which I guess is proof of the age-old adage that opposites attract.The Miami exec is Lucy Hill (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger), who lives a comfortable life and prefers business skirts and clacky high heels. She senses a possible promotion when her company announces it needs someone to restructure one of their out-of-state factories. She volunteers before realizing that she will be sent to New Ulm, one of those middle-of-nowhere towns with a population of less than 15,000 people. When she arrives, she tries to think positively: ""How bad can it be?"" she asks before stepping out the airport door and feeling a bone-chilling arctic wind. You'd think someone traveling to another state would have the foresight to check The Weather Channel before leaving; that way, you would know to pack the right kind of clothing. Alas, no such character exists in a romantic comedy.Lucy soon meets Blanche Gunderson (Siobhan Fallon Hogan), a woman Sarah Palin could communicate with were it not for her thick Minnesota accent. She's wholesome, cheerful, and uncomplicated, a member of a scrapbooking club who guards her tapioca pudding recipe and regularly brings Jesus into everyday conversation. Did you expect anything less from a character named Gunderson? She's to be Lucy's secretary at the factory. For a time, she's also the only friendly face Lucy will come across; New Ulm is a tight-knit community that doesn't take kindly to corporate types, especially since they're more interested in making a profit than they are in the livelihoods of the working class. Indeed, Lucy's restructuring plan involves a serious number of job cuts.The first to voice his opposing views is the union representative, Ted Mitchell (Harry Connick, Jr.), who also serves as a tow-truck driver and a volunteer firefighter. Aside from the fact that he and Lucy don't get along, the fact that he doesn't sound like anyone else in New Ulm is a big clue that the two will eventually fall in love. Ted is originally from North Carolina; he moved to Minnesota (for reasons I won't reveal), and now he's an overprotective single dad raising a shy teenage daughter named Bobbie (Ferron Guerreiro). Lucy can help, here, not because she has children of her own, but because she knows how to dress and put on makeup, which will help Bobbie on her date to a Valentine's Day dance. There are other factors, of course, but do any of them really matter? All we need to know is that Lucy and Ted are falling in love.As the two get closer, the community begins to see Lucy in a different light. Likewise, Lucy begins to respect the community, seeing them as more than beer drinking, ice fishing lowlifes that like polka dancing. Before long, it becomes a life-changing event for everyone. This is about as predictable as some of the film's ""funnier"" moments, such as when Lucy and Ted are out crow hunting, and Lucy has to pee in the woods but can't undo her zipper. Or when a local named Stu Kopenhafer (J.K. Simmons) and a group of coworkers trick Lucy into thinking there's a holiday called Gopher Day. Or when Lucy gets drunk after driving into a ditch and getting stranded. I guess romantic comedies need moments like this, just like they need an assortment of quirky characters. God forbid screenwriters try their hand at witty dialogue or characters with believable personalities.But ""New in Town"" does have the factory subplot to fall back on. There are a select few moments that are actually compelling, not only because they draw on plausible economic situations, but also because they allow the characters to temporarily set aside their quirks. They even give Zellweger the opportunity to finally seem like a real executive and not just a woman who looks silly pacing a factory in high heels. If only there were more moments like this. Maybe this movie didn't need to be a romantic comedy; maybe it could have been better as a dramatic story about a small American town and the corporate entity that seeks to ruin its reputation. It wouldn't allow for anything to bloom between Zellweger and Connick, Jr., but at least the story would be much more engaging. ""New in Town"" is no better or worse than your average romantic comedy, which is disappointing. By now, I wish someone would think up a new way tell this kind of story.",3,Of Romance and Tapioca,1233360000,"01 31, 2009",2009,5035,"['New', 'Town', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'fish-out-of-water',

It's an hour and a half that is predictible, starts off a bit slow, but then gains traction and yes it's sweet. There's not much real New Ulm, Minnesota in here (I happen to know the town pretty well).If your expectations are, some mindless entertainment, a few good laughs, and you happen to like Renee Zellweger (count me in that fan club) or Harry Connick Jr. - well you will enjoy this film. There's no heavy social commentary, no deep insight into human nature, no deep exploration of male female relationships, and the production values are just good. No it's just flat out mindless entertainment.At one point I leaned over to my wife and said, hey wasn't her hair a lot longer in the previous shot? The answer back, who cares? And that's simply the attitude you have to have about this movie, precision doesn't matter so much here. The New Ulm accents, well they are close. Stu Kopenhafer (played by J.R. Simmons - the psychiatrist on Law and Order for 43 episodes) is absolutely the best spot on with his accent. Blanche Gunderson (Siobhan Fallon - '91-92 Saturday Night Live) is pretty good. The others, are passable. It's not Fargo good - no the Fargo accents were perfection.The story - Renee Zellweger is sent from Florida to a newly acquired manufacturing plant in very cold, New Ulm, Minnesota. Her job is to cut the workforce by 50% and mechanize the plant. Eventually she is won over by the characters in the town, they melt her ice cold heart. Obviously Reneee and Harry are attracted to eachother. And, no the ending is not a surprise at all.Early in the movie there is a very funny joke about Renee's nipples, and the effect of cold weather on them. Renee unfortunately walks around with a lot of padding at this time, and that moment is fake.

It lasts a couple of minutes, and that is one of the very few redeemable qualities that this otherwise flat and predictable film has to offer. It's no wonder that this movie came and went very quickly in theaters because I'm really amazed at how poorly constructed it is by Danish director Jonas Elmer and how overly reliant it is on cutesy humor and dated stereotypes. I thought Zellweger already went down the path of the smug career woman with her unctuous turn as a Doris Day wannabe in Peyton Reed's retro-kitschyDown with Love, but it looks like she is going down the well once again with even less fortuitous results this time. She plays Lucy Hill, a cutthroat middle management executive on the fast track in a Miami-based food processing conglomerate. Sent to the arctic-level cold of New Ulm, Minnesota, Lucy has been assigned to dismantle and downsize operations in order to produce a new snack bar line.Tough as nails with the high heels to match, Lucy is unsurprisingly hated by most of the townsfolk with two exceptions. One is her devoted secretary, Blanche Gunderson, who has a secret tapioca recipe that figures into the by-the-numbers plot, and the other is Ted Mitchell, the local union representative who pushes Lucy off her self-anointed pedestal only to find himself falling in love with her. The film's first half is marked by all the typical fish-out-of-water clich&eacute;s that co-screenwriters Kenneth Rance and C. Jay Cox could resuscitate, or at least copy from Charles Shyer'sBaby Boom(1987), while the second half is even worse with Lucy inevitably winning the trust of the townsfolk with her fierce determination redirected in saving the plant. The means by which she finds success for the factory is almost as predictable as the makeover montage showing how she transforms Ted's adolescent daughter into a prom princess. Attempts at Capra-level corn seem not only uninspired but completely unoriginal, and the aw-shucks stereotypes of rural Minnesotans lifted from the Coen Brothers'Fargoonly add to the contrivances pervasive throughout the plot.Photographed in a most unflattering manner, Zellweger has rarely been this unappealing onscreen, and it's a wonder why she would have accepted a role as soul-curdling as Lucy. Connick comes across as either belligerent or listless as Ted, and the chemistry between the actors suffers for the dichotomy. As kind-hearted Blanche, Siobhan Fallon Hogan (the birthing coach inBaby Mama) is never given a chance to elevate the character above a regional stereotype, while J.K. Simmons (the wiseacre father inJuno) manages to score a few points as the plant's curmudgeonly foreman. Interestingly, Winnipeg, Manitoba substitutes for rural Minnesota, and credit cinematographer Chris Seager for fully capturing the rigorous winter conditions. Given how dismal the movie's box office returns were, the 2009 DVD provides a surprisingly robust set of extras with a making-of featurette as well as a couple of other shorts spotlighting some of the plot devices like scrapbooking and tapioca pudding. There are some deleted scenes and an optional commentary track with the cast and crew.",2,Another Fish-Out-of-Water Tale with a Dismally Used Zellweger,1245628800,"06 22, 2009",2009,3295,"['quiet', 'fireside', 'scene', 'stars', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Zellweger', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'couch', 'midway', '2009', 'rom-com', 'couple', 'minutes', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'redeemable', 'qualities', 'otherwise', 'flat', 'predictable', 'film', 'offer', 'wonder', 'movie', 'came', 'went', 'very', 'quickly', 'theaters', ""'m"", 'really', 'amazed', 'how', 'poorly', 'constructed', 'Danish', 'director', 'Jonas', 'Elmer', 'how', 'overly', 'reliant', 'cutesy', 'humor', 'dated', 'stereotypes', 'thought', 'Zellweger', 'already', 'went', 'path', 'smug', 'career', 'woman', 'unctuous', 'turn', 'Doris', 'Day', 'wannabe', 'Peyton', 'Reed', 'retro-kitschyDown', 'Love', 'going', 'down', 'well', 'once', 'again', 'even', 'less', 'fortuitous', 'results', 'time', 'Lucy', 'Hill', 'cutthroat', 'middle', 'management', 'executive', 'fast', 'track', 'Miami-based', 'food', 'processing', 'conglomerate', 'Sent', 'arctic-level', 'cold', 'New', 'Ulm', 'Minnesota', 'Lucy', 'been', 'assigned', 'dismantle', 'downsize', 'operations', 'order', 'produce', 'new', 'snack', 'bar', 'line.Tough', 'nails', 'high', 'heels', 'match', 'Lucy', 'unsurprisingly', 'hated', 'most', 'townsfolk', 'two', 'exceptions', 'One', 'devoted', 'secretary', 'Blanche', 'Gunderson', 'who', 'secret', 'tapioca', 'recipe', 'by-the-numbers', 'plot', 'other', 'Ted', 'Mitchell', 'local', 'union', 'representative', 'who', 'Lucy', 'self-anointed', 'pedestal', 'only', 'find', 'falling', 'love', 'film', 'first', 'half', 'marked', 'typical', 'fish-out-of-water', 'clich', 'eacute', 'co-screenwriters', 'Kenneth', 'Rance', 'C.', 'Jay', 'Cox', 'could', 'resuscitate', 'least', 'copy', 'Charles', ""Shyer'sBaby"", 'Boom', '1987', 'second', 'half', 'even', 'worse', 'Lucy', 'inevitably', 'winning', 'trust', 'townsfolk', 'fierce', 'determination', 'redirected', 'saving', 'plant', 'means', 'success', 'factory', 'almost', 'as', 'predictable', 'makeover', 'montage', 'showing', 'how', 'Ted', 'adolescent', 'daughter', 'prom', 'princess', 'Attempts', 'Capra-level', 'corn', 'seem', 'not', 'only', 'uninspired', 'completely', 'unoriginal', 'aw-shucks', 'stereotypes', 'rural', 'Minnesotans', 'lifted', 'Coen', ""Brothers'Fargoonly"", 'contrivances', 'pervasive', 'plot.Photographed', 'most', 'unflattering', 'manner', 'Zellweger', 'rarely', 'been', 'unappealing', 'onscreen', 'wonder', 'why', 'would', 'have', 'accepted', 'role', 'as', 'soul-curdling', 'Lucy', 'Connick', 'belligerent', 'listless', 'Ted', 'chemistry', 'actors', 'suffers', 'dichotomy', 'kind-hearted', 'Blanche', 'Siobhan', 'Fallon', 'Hogan', 'birthing', 'coach', 'inBaby', 'Mama', 'never', 'given', 'chance', 'elevate', 'character', 'regional', 'stereotype', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'wiseacre', 'father', 'inJuno', 'score', 'few', 'points', 'plant', 'curmudgeonly', 'foreman', 'Interestingly', 'Winnipeg', 'Manitoba', 'rural', 'Minnesota', 'credit', 'cinematographer', 'Chris', 'Seager', 'fully', 'capturing', 'rigorous', 'winter', 'conditions', 'Given', 'how', 'dismal', 'movie', 'box', 'office', 'returns', 'were', '2009', 'DVD', 'surprisingly', 'robust', 'set', 'extras', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'as', 'well', 'couple', 'other', 'shorts', 'spotlighting', 'plot', 'devices', 'scrapbooking', 'tapioca', 'pudding', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'optional', 'commentary', 'track', 'cast', 'crew']",New In Town

Of course! Studios don't make movies to loose money. Everyone knows that Scrooge will change his attitude in ""A Christmas Carol"" but does that make Charles Dicken's a bad writer? NO WAY.So expect the expected but enjoy the funny, romantic, suspense, and characterization that is to be viewed along the way. That's what makes this movie so nice--so honestly 5-star good.Take Lucy Hill (Renee Zellweger), the lone female of the corporate executive pool in a company needing someone to head to Minnesota, the arctic, to rid the company of losses and half a factory work force.  Predictable because you know the lady-exec will get the draft, and you know the outcome will turn out positive.  You also know that Zellweger will be sexy, completely believable, and outstanding in her portrayal of the lady-executive with an attitude needing changed--LIKE EBENEZER.

Connick played Ted, the guy everyone seems upset to ""expect"" romance from at the film's beginning.  He's handsome, Zellweger's beautiful, so expect sparks.I'm sure the director, Jonas Elmer, intended you to expect a romance. Why else would he put such an outrageous conflict of characters in such extreme settings so early in the film? The story is in the journey, not the outcome.

1244715,A3ML2HRDE3PY5I,B001WAKOW6,Hikari,"[12, 17]","2.5 stars. The title of my review pays homage to several influences that came to mind while watching ""New in Town"", all of which, I might add, were funnier than this. Multifaceted Oscar winner Renee Zellweger has finally encountered a role she can't pull off convincingly, that of a ruthlessly ambitious corporate management type tasked with turning around an underperforming factory.  'Fish out of Water' stereotypes abound as our plucky gal travels from Miami to New Ulm, MN (Winnipeg stands in for Minnesota here, and is even colder, if that is possible), to earn herself a promotion by making the factory profitable.  As her entire wardrobe consists of designer suits and shoes more fitting of a fashion editor covering the Bryant Park shows than to a hard hat zone in Minnesota in the middle of winter, her new subordinates are doubtful that this will be achieved.  As are we.  Of course, the script demands that everyone, including the hunky union boss (Harry Connick, Jr.) take an instant dislike to the stuck-up big city suit intent on screwing them out of a job, until, of course, she reveals her pluckiness and charm and they win her over with tapioca and down-home Midwestern gumption.  Renee Zellweger has proven that there is no other actress more willing to take physical pratfalls and otherwise look ridiculous as she, and she pratfalls her little heart out as she falls sideways in the snow; falls facedown in the snow; falls backwards off the porch into snow while drunk; gets her car stuck in the snow; and memorably tries to take a pee in the woods while wearing about 75 pounds of snowsuit.  She works her little heart out to bring the funny, but the script lets her down and just never gels into a cohesive whole.  Some of the supporting players are effortlessly hilarious, most notably Siobhan Fallon Hogan as Blanche Gunderson, who is certainly related to Frances McDormand's Sheriff Marge Gunderson of ""Fargo"", and J.K. Simmons (Spiderman; The Closer), nearly unrecognizable under a 10-pound beard and even heavier Minnesota accent.  The leads unfortunately can't save this from being a freeze-dried piece of Rom-Com Screenwriting 101 complete with Midwestern sterotypes.  Even if the good people of Minnesota have no other hobbies besides ice fishing, scrapbooking and eating tapioca (which I'm sure they do), this is insulting all the same.  Matthau and Lemmon did this better, and had loads more chemistry, too.  It's kinda a shame that so many cast and crew members braved frostbite for this frozen dud.  But the Academy might consider minting a new award and making Renee its shoo-in first recipient: Best Performance in Stiletto Heels on Snow Pack by a Lead Actress.  Really--she deserves some kind of recognition for that.",2,Grumpy Young Woman going Gung Ho in Fargo,1243814400,"06 1, 2009",2009,2753,"['2.5', 'stars', 'title', 'review', 'homage', 'several', 'influences', 'came', 'mind', 'watching', 'New', 'Town', 'might', 'add', 'were', 'funnier', 'Multifaceted', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'finally', 'encountered', 'role', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'convincingly', 'ruthlessly', 'ambitious', 'corporate', 'management', 'type', 'tasked', 'turning', 'around', 'underperforming', 'factory', ""'Fish"", 'Water', 'stereotypes', 'plucky', 'gal', 'travels', 'Miami', 'New', 'Ulm', 'MN', 'Winnipeg', 'Minnesota', 'here', 'even', 'colder', 'possible', 'earn', 'promotion', 'making', 'factory', 'profitable', 'entire', 'wardrobe', 'designer', 'suits', 'shoes', 'more', 'fitting', 'fashion', 'editor', 'covering', 'Bryant', 'Park', 'hard', 'hat', 'zone', 'Minnesota', 'middle', 'winter', 'new', 'subordinates', 'are', 'doubtful', 'will', 'be', 'achieved', 'are', 'course', 'script', 'everyone', 'including', 'hunky', 'union', 'boss', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'take', 'instant', 'dislike', 'stuck-up', 'big', 'city', 'suit', 'intent', 'screwing', 'job', 'course', 'pluckiness', 'charm', 'win', 'tapioca', 'down-home', 'Midwestern', 'gumption', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'proven', 'other', 'actress', 'more', 'willing', 'take', 'physical', 'pratfalls', 'otherwise', 'look', 'ridiculous', 'little', 'heart', 'out', 'sideways', 'snow', 'facedown', 'snow', 'backwards', 'porch', 'snow', 'drunk', 'car', 'stuck', 'snow', 'memorably', 'take', 'pee', 'woods', 'wearing', '75', 'pounds', 'snowsuit', 'little', 'heart', 'bring', 'funny', 'script', 'down', 'just', 'never', 'gels', 'cohesive', 'whole', 'supporting', 'players', 'are', 'effortlessly', 'hilarious', 'most', 'notably', 'Siobhan', 'Fallon', 'Hogan', 'Blanche', 'Gunderson', 'who', 'certainly', 'related', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'Sheriff', 'Marge', 'Gunderson', 'Fargo', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'Spiderman', 'Closer', 'nearly', 'unrecognizable', '10-pound', 'beard', 'even', 'heavier', 'Minnesota', 'accent', 'leads', 'unfortunately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'being', 'freeze-dried', 'piece', 'Rom-Com', 'Screenwriting', '101', 'complete', 'Midwestern', 'sterotypes', 'Even', 'good', 'people', 'Minnesota', 'have', 'other', 'hobbies', 'ice', 'fishing', 'scrapbooking', 'eating', 'tapioca', ""'m"", 'sure', 'do', 'insulting', 'same', 'Matthau', 'Lemmon', 'did', 'better', 'had', 'loads', 'more', 'chemistry', 'too', 'kinda', 'shame', 'so', 'many', 'cast', 'crew', 'members', 'braved', 'frostbite', 'frozen', 'dud', 'Academy', 'might', 'consider', 'minting', 'new', 'award', 'making', 'Renee', 'shoo-in', 'first', 'recipient', 'Best', 'Performance', 'Stiletto', 'Heels', 'Snow', 'Pack', 'Lead', 'Actress', 'Really', 'kind', 'recognition']",New In Town

1244725,AA90W95STFGAC,B001WAKOW6,jj,"[3, 5]","The girl at the video store said this film wasn't very good, but I LOVE Renee, so I went ahead and bought it.  She was right.  I actually turned it off in the middle somewhere---it was just too boring.  Normally I don't go back, but I gave this one a second shot and the second half was pretty good.From the 44 other reviewers who have written before me, I suspect the buyer is fairly well warned.  I am writing to say something to the producers, if they should read this.Here it is in a nutshell:  You (and almost every other producer in hollywood) need an executive story producer who has the final say.  I suspect the original script was a whole lot better than this film, and someone too close to the footage lost sight of what makes for a good story.  An executive story producer could tell you VERY QUCIKLY, you just can't throw Renee into a jogging scene, and then a meeting where she shows up late (People on the fast track don't show up late), and expect the audience to know what is going on or care about this character.There is such a thing as a set-up.For example: she loves her fancy Miami apartment, she loves warm weather, she loves fashion, she wouldn't be caught dead without five inch heels, she cares about the homeless.  There has to be SOMETHING that makes us love her.  Something!AND, we needed a former plant manager telling her what it's going to be like in this awful place---then her cavalier reaction to set up what actually happens and make it funny.  Mr. and Ms. Producer---it's all so dull.AND, you start this film with HER for pete's sake---she is the star.  I bought it to see HER (and whoever lit her scenes should be set on fire---she looked old and I suspect she looks fab in great light.)  You paid her big bucks to be there, make the most of it.  Same with HC Jr.---come on, he looked disgusting in the whole film with that ragged beard and those dirty-looking clothes.  Again, you want the viewer to step into the fictive dream, not run from it.  You don't want the viewer to be saying, ""Eeewww"" all the way through the film---with both of the leads.  Bad. Bad. Bad.Clearly, Blanche stole this film away from both of them---so you could have saved some coin if that was the plan.  (and we all know it wasn't) But good for you, Blanche actress.The sound was awful at the start and I always think this signals a bad film.  Get that right---there is no story if you cannot hear it.  There's also NO EXCUSE for that kind of sloppiness, and yet it is rampant in big-budget films.But the biggest sin was that we did not care about Renee, and I LOVE Renee.  As I said, I turned it off.  Come on, an executive story producer would have seen this sin right off the bat.  You need that.And the story just kept getting worse.  I did not realize she was going for a long time until we started buzzing through the holidays.  Buzzing---one minute it is Christmas and the next it is Valentines day.I did not realize any union guy was important until she said she needed to kiss his butt---I still don't know why.  I don't even know precisely why she was there; why she needed to be there so long to cut jobs.I do know when she fired the boss and everyone idled the plant---who, what and how did she get it going again?  The story was just not there---I mean if she had begged him to come back and he refused, then at least we would have some sense of why everyone went back to work and why he talked to her again at the end of the film.The Rocky type ending I liked a lot.  That saved this film from being one star.  As I said, the second half was a whole lot better because we knew these people and liked them and wanted to cheer for them.BUT (big butt)--- wanting to cheer for someone should have been there five minutes into this film.  Any respectable writer could have told you that, and this film could have made MANY millions of dollars.Get a STORY PRODUCER---you and the rest of Hollywood!

Adhering to the genre - boy and girl meet, spark, soften, screw-up and make a mess, separate and change into better people so that happily ever after seems like a sure thing -- New in Town doesn't contain many plot twists or surprises. And if you happen to be a fan of romantic comedy, you should not be disappointed by the playing out of said character development and plot.The secondary characters in New are charming and eclipsed the leads. I adored Blanche (Siobhan Fallon) with her sweet Minnesota sensibilities, big, drippy heart and quirky out-loud thoughts. The dialog contains loads of chuckles and some of the physical humor is laugh-out-loud funny.The film is sweet and perfect for a chick-flick night or would be a great date movie. New is reminiscient of movies like While You Were Sleeping, Two Weeks Notice and The Wedding Planner. Fans of this genre or any of these films will want to make sure to rent if not buy outright.New in Town is family friendly save for random smatterings of moderate curse words and a scene wherein the heroine wears a tight, clingy sweater and reacts to the cold. There is a potty in the woods scene that may not be considered appropriate for those of you who screen movies very carefully for sexual/suggestive content. A mild make-out scene is hidden for the most part. I have seen/heard much worse on sitcoms.We rented the film but it will become an addition to our library.

In my experience, I don't have to fast forward/tell my kids to cover their eyes/tell my kids to leave the room/just turn the thing off if a chick flick is PG.  Unfortunately, Hollywood just can't seem to master the art of combining decent and clean with high quality.  Renee Zellweger and Harry Connick were okay as the leads.  I've always liked Connick and Zellweger is growing on me.  However, the story is 100% predictable - Prada-laden, cutthroat businesswoman from Florida meets frozen backwards Minnesotan hicks.  The romance played out the way I guessed from when the two characters first met.  And the business storyline also played out as predicted.

There is No chemsitry between the leads.  There is nothing happening with them in any of their scenes together. The stuck zipper scene should have been charming, playfull, and cute at least, but NOTHING!  Rene has to be the one to start the kissing action and then she does it while the poor slob is telling her about his first wife dying! That is romantic?2.  Rene Z. isn't even filmed in such away that she looks attractive.  The male lead is crubby looking and comes on as a ""pig.""  I understand that  this maybe the script's fault, but he never becomes likeable.3. The script is predictable and the ending, well you know is coming  way too early.

I'm generally not an American comedy fan, but this one is different.Renee Zellweger plays Lucy Hill, a bright career woman who is determined to climb the corporate ladder at Munck Foods no matter who she steps on to get to that coveted VP slot.When Munck execs determine that a remote Minnesota factory needs to be retooled to make energy bars, she jumps on the chance to go and prove herself even if it means firing half the factory.Miami raised Lucy is completely unprepared for a Minnesota winter.  She arrives in high heels and hose and quickly learns about boots and layering.Blanche Gunderson (Siobhan Fallon), her secretary, also teaches her about old fashioned values including sitting down to the dinner table with the union rep and keeping things personal and real between herself and her staff.Then there's Ted (Harry Connick, Junior), the union rep.  Naturally, he's going to be the bane of management's existence, but he's also the kind of guy to rescue stranded women out of snow drifts.The humor's a little raunchy, think of what the Prairie Home Companion people would say if they could say what they really thought, and you might want to take an extra sweater into the theatre.  Maybe order a hot chocolate instead of the coke as refreshments.  All that snow is pretty suggestive.""New in Town"" is an old style comedy with updated dialogue and humor.  It all works.

1244785,A25QJBK33C4O0R,B001WAKOW6,"terpfan1980 ""Barry""","[0, 0]","A few things come to mind when watching this film, many of those thoughts included in the few words I've used in the title for this review: predictable - check!, cliched - check!, stereotypical - check!  If you watch this film, you'll probably think of a few more words that apply, and not just words that mean the same thing.Predictable? Most definitely.  After being almost literally hit on the head with the mentions of a particular item you can fairly easily predict that the mentioned item will figure prominently at a key moment.Cliched and stereotypical? It doesn't take much more than the early acts to set up that we're going to see a big city gal go to the cold and nasty, and oh, yeah, countrified and assumed to be less than sophisticated nether regions of the heartland: Minnesota, eh!Formulaic just comes along for the ride since this is yet another romantic comedy that has to follow the requisite road map for such movies, after all, Hollywood wouldn't want to break the mold and try for originality since they can't use their predictions and modelling to tell how original material will score at the box office.New in Town is an ok film, but I really can't go much higher than just the ok level.  Again, with the cliches, predictability, and stereotyping of people from the heartland, it's hard to not consider the film slightly flawed, despite performances that are certainly respectable.  Harry Connick, Jr., sporting a beard and look that is more like something you'd expect to see, say, David Cook (of American Idol fame) wearing (fuzzy beard/whiskers, somewhat shaggy hair style) seems ok for the role he's asked to play, and Renee Zellweger is cute and perky, though reminiscent of a past character she played: Bridget Jones.  The supporting characters are ok, though they pile on the Minnesota accent pretty heavily (which adds to the cliches and stereotyping I've complained about here).A couple of frustrations/ notes/ comments about the Blu-ray presentation: this is the first film that I noticed (I'm sure it's happened before, but it's the first time I'm noticing it) a blatant commercial before the previews and other material that comes before the feature presentation here.  The Blu-ray includes an ad for a company that sells an overage of stock items.  Bleh.  It'd be nice to think that such ads would help keep the prices of these dics down, but that would be wishful thinking (given the retail price of this disc).  I'd have no issue having a good 10 minutes worth of commercials at the start of a disc if it meant shaving say $10 off the price of the disc, but that isn't going to happen as the studios use such things to add to the profit margin rather than reduce the prices of the products.Similarly, this film is chock full of product placement.  Enough to prominently feature the product placement team in the credits at the end of the film, as if viewers need to be reminded that they heard mentions of those companies or saw the king of beer bottles repeatedly featured on the screen.(Almost) Finally, to whomever designed the menu system on the Blu-ray, what were you thinking?!  While it's not horrible, it's almost barely usable because the menu doesn't indicate anywhere what menu item is selected/highlighted.  Well, actually, perhaps it does, but not in any way that is obvious to the user.  I say that because the menu for the disc slides left to right or right to left and the item that is at the left of the screen is the one that will be active.  Never mind that there are 3 other choices shown on the screen and that none of the choices are highlighted in any way, just assume that the left most item is the menu that is active.  Gee, thanks.  How about changing the color of the item, making it bolder, put a flashing widget around it or doing something else that would show what menu item is selected?!I said *almost* finally above because I had one last thought and then the close to this review.  The one last thought was why the movie includes questions about the religious beliefs of Zellweger's character.  Questions that seem to be thrown in to enhance the stereotyping that goes on here.  That plot item was played for a little humor, but then shows up again which makes it obvious that someone wanted to make a point about such things which raises the question: why?  It wasn't needed at all, and just makes the film seem to tweak viewers that much more.Now, finally, the important question: rent it or buy it?  Given the price tag, I'd be more inclined to say rent it.  My wife (who I watched this with) knows I'm partial to Ms. Zellweger, but even as a fans of hers I'm not really inspired to spend more than the rental fee on this one.",3,"Predictable, cliched, stereotypical, formulaic rom-com",1243728000,"05 31, 2009",2009,4703,"['few', 'things', 'come', 'mind', 'when', 'watching', 'film', 'many', 'thoughts', 'included', 'few', 'words', ""'ve"", 'used', 'title', 'review', 'predictable', 'check', 'cliched', 'check', 'stereotypical', 'check', 'watch', 'film', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'think', 'few', 'more', 'words', 'apply', 'not', 'just', 'words', 'mean', 'same', 'thing.Predictable', 'Most', 'definitely', 'being', 'almost', 'literally', 'hit', 'head', 'mentions', 'particular', 'item', 'can', 'fairly', 'easily', 'predict', 'mentioned', 'item', 'will', 'figure', 'prominently', 'key', 'moment.Cliched', 'stereotypical', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'more', 'early', 'acts', 'set', 'up', ""'re"", 'going', 'see', 'big', 'city', 'gal', 'go', 'cold', 'nasty', 'oh', 'yeah', 'countrified', 'assumed', 'be', 'less', 'sophisticated', 'nether', 'regions', 'heartland', 'Minnesota', 'eh', 'Formulaic', 'just', 'along', 'ride', 'yet', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'follow', 'requisite', 'road', 'map', 'such', 'movies', 'Hollywood', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'break', 'mold', 'try', 'originality', 'ca', ""n't"", 'use', 'predictions', 'modelling', 'tell', 'how', 'original', 'material', 'will', 'score', 'box', 'office.New', 'Town', 'ok', 'film', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'much', 'higher', 'just', 'ok', 'level', 'Again', 'cliches', 'predictability', 'stereotyping', 'people', 'heartland', 'hard', 'not', 'consider', 'film', 'slightly', 'flawed', 'performances', 'are', 'certainly', 'respectable', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'sporting', 'beard', 'look', 'more', 'something', ""'d"", 'expect', 'see', 'say', 'David', 'Cook', 'American', 'Idol', 'fame', 'wearing', 'fuzzy', 'beard/whiskers', 'somewhat', 'shaggy', 'hair', 'style', 'ok', 'role', 'asked', 'play', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'cute', 'perky', 'reminiscent', 'past', 'character', 'played', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'ok', 'pile', 'Minnesota', 'accent', 'pretty', 'heavily', 'cliches', 'stereotyping', ""'ve"", 'complained', 'here', '.A', 'couple', 'frustrations/', 'notes/', 'comments', 'Blu-ray', 'presentation', 'first', 'film', 'noticed', ""'m"", 'sure', 'happened', 'first', 'time', ""'m"", 'noticing', 'blatant', 'commercial', 'previews', 'other', 'material', 'feature', 'presentation', 'here', 'Blu-ray', 'ad', 'company', 'overage', 'stock', 'items', 'Bleh', ""'d"", 'be', 'nice', 'think', 'such', 'ads', 'would', 'help', 'keep', 'prices', 'dics', 'down', 'would', 'be', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'given', 'retail', 'price', 'disc', ""'d"", 'have', 'issue', 'having', 'good', '10', 'minutes', 'commercials', 'start', 'disc', 'meant', 'shaving', 'say', '10', 'price', 'disc', ""n't"", 'going', 'happen', 'studios', 'use', 'such', 'things', 'add', 'profit', 'margin', 'rather', 'reduce', 'prices', 'products.Similarly', 'film', 'chock', 'full', 'product', 'placement', 'Enough', 'prominently', 'feature', 'product', 'placement', 'team', 'credits', 'end', 'film', 'viewers', 'need', 'be', 'reminded', 'heard', 'mentions', 'companies', 'saw', 'king', 'beer', 'bottles', 'repeatedly', 'featured', 'screen', 'Almost', 'Finally', 'whomever', 'designed', 'menu', 'system', 'Blu-ray', 'what', 'were', 'thinking', 'not', 'horrible', 'almost', 'barely', 'usable', 'menu', ""n't"", 'indicate', 'anywhere', 'what', 'menu', 'item', 'selected/highlighted', 'Well', 'actually', 'perhaps', 'not', 'way', 'obvious', 'user', 'say', 'menu', 'disc', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'item', 'left', 'screen', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'active', 'mind', 'are', '3', 'other', 'choices', 'shown', 'screen', 'none', 'choices', 'are', 'highlighted', 'way', 'just', 'assume', 'left', 'most', 'item', 'menu', 'active', 'Gee', 'thanks', 'How', 'changing', 'color', 'item', 'making', 'bolder', 'put', 'flashing', 'widget', 'doing', 'something', 'else', 'would', 'show', 'what', 'menu', 'item', 'selected', 'said', '*almost*', 'finally', 'had', 'one', 'last', 'thought', 'then', 'close', 'review', 'one', 'last', 'thought', 'was', 'why', 'movie', 'questions', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'Zellweger', 'character', 'Questions', 'seem', 'be', 'thrown', 'enhance', 'stereotyping', 'here', 'plot', 'item', 'was', 'played', 'little', 'humor', 'then', 'up', 'again', 'obvious', 'someone', 'wanted', 'make', 'point', 'such', 'things', 'question', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'needed', 'just', 'film', 'seem', 'tweak', 'viewers', 'much', 'finally', 'important', 'question', 'rent', 'buy', 'price', 'tag', ""'d"", 'be', 'more', 'inclined', 'say', 'rent', 'wife', 'who', 'watched', ""'m"", 'partial', 'Ms.', 'Zellweger', 'even', 'fans', 'hers', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'inspired', 'spend', 'more', 'rental', 'fee', 'one']",New In Town
1244786,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B001WAKOW6,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[43, 49]","When I saw a trailer for this film, I saw it compared with ""Fargo,"" the Coen brothers classic. My spouse and I were both in need of a laugh so we went to see it.I must agree with at least one other review that it's an absurdly predictable story. Boy meets girl, they despise each other, yet fall in love and they all live happily ever after. That element of the story was a letdown. But there were enough laughs to redeem the story.I'll paraphrase, and perhaps add a little to another review: Rene plays Lucy Hill, a rising Yuppie corporate exec based in Miami. The company decides to send someone to Minnesota to close one of their plants. None of the guys will do it so Lucy volunteers. She, in true, corporate tradition, has her eye on corporate VP, something she's going to get when she faithfully fulfills the company's goals, right?Well, when she gets to MN, she has so little perception of the conditions--cold, slippery--that she is, alas, a fish out of water. She meets her assistant, masterfully performed by Siobhan Fallon, who is an exaggeration of Frances McDormand's role in ""Fargo."" Her one-liners had both my spouse and I ""ROFL""ing. I do have a comment though on Fallon's (Blanche Gunderson's) monolog: She asked Lucy if she's found Jesus, and that became the cause for a burst of laughter from both Lucy and presumably the audience. I thought that question to be slightly incongruous; it's something one would have more likely experienced in, say, Mississippi or Georgia than in New Ulm, MN.Well, then, Lucy, while secretly trying to close the plant, meets fireman Ted Mitchell (Harry Connick) when she flew off the icy road. They eventually fall in love... Well, the synopsis has already been written here so I won't repeat it.In the process, not only is love fallen into, but Lucy decides that, shucks, these are nice people. (The story reminded me of Michael J. Fox's ""Doc Hollywood"" and countless other scripts.) She decides to keep the place open, and they come up with a new product, blah, blah, blah.From an honest perspective, while I was laughing at the script, I found that portion of the story to be a complete fantasy. Most of us know how corporations work these days. First, the product they came up with (no, I won't give it away here and spoil the story) wouldn't compete with the corporate, pre-packaged and advertised product. Second, no, the corporation's not going to say, ""Aw, shucks, let's be nice to these folks whom Lucy told us are are so quaint.""Then, without giving any more away, Lucy and Ted fall in love, and they all lived happily ever after.Hmmm. I'm quite critical of the story. So why do I give it four stars?  Because of the laughs.Again, I think the idea of the accent was a product of McDormand's academy award winning role in ""Fargo."" In this film, they may have made a little more of a caricature out of it. One of the Minnesotan characters, by the way, was played by one of my heroines, Frances Conroy (I'm a big ""Six Feet Under"" fan). But it was so well done, it had me laughing thoughout.Then there's the scene when Ted and Lucy try to disguise their indiscretion so that Ted's daughter didn't know what happened, another side-buster.  But the choreography necessary of Lucy while Ted and Lucy were hunting and nature called was worth the price of the ticket.No, I won't give away any more than that, but it was hysterical.Again, as others have already said and more will surely say, if you're after a soul-enhancing, humanitarian, or realistic story, this one might not be for you. That ain't the way life works except maybe in the movies. but if you'd like some hearty laughs--maybe a little to deliver you from what's going on in today's economy, this is a side breaker.",4,"Predictable romance, but hysterical",1233705600,"02 4, 2009",2009,3731,"['When', 'saw', 'trailer', 'film', 'saw', 'compared', 'Fargo', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'classic', 'spouse', 'were', 'need', 'laugh', 'went', 'see', 'it.I', 'must', 'agree', 'least', 'one', 'other', 'review', 'absurdly', 'predictable', 'story', 'Boy', 'girl', 'despise', 'other', 'yet', 'fall', 'love', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'element', 'story', 'was', 'letdown', 'were', 'enough', 'laughs', 'redeem', 'story.I', ""'ll"", 'paraphrase', 'perhaps', 'add', 'little', 'review', 'Rene', 'Lucy', 'Hill', 'rising', 'Yuppie', 'corporate', 'exec', 'based', 'Miami', 'company', 'send', 'someone', 'Minnesota', 'close', 'one', 'plants', 'None', 'guys', 'will', 'do', 'so', 'Lucy', 'volunteers', 'true', 'corporate', 'tradition', 'eye', 'corporate', 'VP', 'something', 'going', 'get', 'when', 'faithfully', 'company', 'goals', 'right', 'Well', 'when', 'MN', 'so', 'little', 'perception', 'conditions', 'cold', 'slippery', 'alas', 'fish', 'water', 'assistant', 'masterfully', 'performed', 'Siobhan', 'Fallon', 'who', 'exaggeration', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'role', 'Fargo', 'one-liners', 'had', 'spouse', 'ROFL', 'ing', 'do', 'have', 'comment', 'Fallon', 'Blanche', 'Gunderson', 'monolog', 'asked', 'Lucy', 'found', 'Jesus', 'became', 'cause', 'burst', 'laughter', 'Lucy', 'presumably', 'audience', 'thought', 'question', 'be', 'slightly', 'incongruous', 'something', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'more', 'likely', 'experienced', 'say', 'Mississippi', 'Georgia', 'New', 'Ulm', 'MN.Well', 'then', 'Lucy', 'secretly', 'trying', 'close', 'plant', 'meets', 'fireman', 'Ted', 'Mitchell', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'when', 'flew', 'icy', 'road', 'eventually', 'fall', 'love', 'Well', 'synopsis', 'already', 'been', 'written', 'here', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'it.In', 'process', 'not', 'only', 'love', 'fallen', 'Lucy', 'shucks', 'are', 'nice', 'people', 'story', 'reminded', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'Doc', 'Hollywood', 'countless', 'other', 'scripts', 'keep', 'place', 'open', 'come', 'up', 'new', 'product', 'blah', 'blah', 'honest', 'perspective', 'was', 'laughing', 'script', 'found', 'portion', 'story', 'be', 'complete', 'fantasy', 'Most', 'know', 'how', 'corporations', 'work', 'days', 'First', 'product', 'came', 'up', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'here', 'spoil', 'story', 'would', ""n't"", 'compete', 'corporate', 'pre-packaged', 'advertised', 'product', 'Second', 'corporation', 'not', 'going', 'say', 'Aw', 'shucks', 'let', 'be', 'nice', 'folks', 'whom', 'Lucy', 'told', 'are', 'are', 'so', 'quaint', 'Then', 'giving', 'more', 'away', 'Lucy', 'Ted', 'fall', 'love', 'lived', 'happily', 'ever', 'after.Hmmm', ""'m"", 'quite', 'critical', 'story', 'So', 'why', 'do', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'laughs.Again', 'think', 'idea', 'accent', 'was', 'product', 'McDormand', 'academy', 'award', 'winning', 'role', 'Fargo', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'little', 'more', 'caricature', 'One', 'Minnesotan', 'characters', 'way', 'was', 'played', 'one', 'heroines', 'Frances', 'Conroy', ""'m"", 'big', 'Six', 'Feet', 'fan', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'had', 'laughing', 'scene', 'when', 'Ted', 'Lucy', 'try', 'disguise', 'indiscretion', 'Ted', 'daughter', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'side-buster', 'choreography', 'necessary', 'Lucy', 'Ted', 'Lucy', 'were', 'hunting', 'nature', 'called', 'was', 'price', 'ticket.No', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'more', 'was', 'hysterical.Again', 'others', 'have', 'already', 'said', 'more', 'will', 'surely', 'say', ""'re"", 'soul-enhancing', 'humanitarian', 'realistic', 'story', 'one', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'ai', ""n't"", 'way', 'life', 'maybe', 'movies', ""'d"", 'like', 'hearty', 'laughs', 'maybe', 'little', 'deliver', 'what', 'going', 'today', 'economy', 'side', 'breaker']",New In Town
