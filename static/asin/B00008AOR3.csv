This shows a richness and a subtle softness in her voice that proves only voices like Sinatra or Bennett, like Ms. Peggy here, could pull off the numbers with a style that shows a different approach vocally that, were she 30 years younger, might not have come out. No one who loves this woman's style will regret buying this one.",5,Like a fine wine,1253577600,"09 22, 2009",2009,413,"['am', 'bowled', 'criticism', 'not', 'best..they', 'are', 'best', 'richness', 'subtle', 'softness', 'voice', 'only', 'voices', 'Sinatra', 'Bennett', 'Ms.', 'Peggy', 'here', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'numbers', 'style', 'different', 'approach', 'vocally', 'were', '30', 'years', 'younger', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'one', 'who', 'woman', 'style', 'will', 'regret', 'buying', 'one']",N/A

Carter Joseph ""CARTERJ""","[4, 4]","This 'club date', recorded in its entirety in the early 1980s, is an important document of a seminal figure in American music, the divine Peggy Lee. Although just a few years past the time when her voice could shine with that famous crispness and clarity, and before the time when her health problems caused her voice to shrink to a whisper, here she is still at the top of her game, and her musicianship is undiminished.This woman literally lived to make music, and the combo that backs her up obviously love collaborating with her. She looks great, never misses a beat or an inflection, and has the audience (and us) right in the palm of her hand. And the musicianship of everyone concerned here is dazzling. If you love Peggy Lee as I do, you must own this disc. A friend came over for dinner last night and we watched it afterward. He was transfixed, blown away.Along with Ella Fitzgerald and maybe Barbra Streisand, Peggy Lee just may be the greatest female singer of them all. Her subtlety is unmatched. For Ella, the words were almost beside the point (a songwriter once remarked, ""Why bother writing lyrics when Ella does so well without them?""). But for Peggy Lee, the words and the music are inseparable. She takes you to the inner core of a song like nobody else, and always leaves a touch of mystery, never overstating the case.A delight, a treasure,in every way. The disc is one of the jewels in my collection.",5,AN EXHILERATING DELIGHT,1254700800,"10 5, 2009",2009,1423,"[""'club"", 'date', 'recorded', 'entirety', 'early', '1980s', 'important', 'document', 'seminal', 'figure', 'American', 'music', 'divine', 'Peggy', 'Lee', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'time', 'when', 'voice', 'could', 'shine', 'famous', 'crispness', 'clarity', 'time', 'when', 'health', 'problems', 'caused', 'voice', 'shrink', 'whisper', 'here', 'still', 'top', 'game', 'musicianship', 'undiminished.This', 'woman', 'literally', 'lived', 'make', 'music', 'combo', 'up', 'obviously', 'collaborating', 'great', 'never', 'beat', 'inflection', 'audience', 'right', 'palm', 'hand', 'musicianship', 'everyone', 'concerned', 'here', 'dazzling', 'love', 'Peggy', 'Lee', 'do', 'must', 'own', 'disc', 'friend', 'came', 'dinner', 'last', 'night', 'watched', 'afterward', 'was', 'transfixed', 'blown', 'away.Along', 'Ella', 'Fitzgerald', 'maybe', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'Peggy', 'Lee', 'just', 'may', 'be', 'greatest', 'female', 'singer', 'subtlety', 'unmatched', 'Ella', 'words', 'were', 'almost', 'point', 'songwriter', 'once', 'remarked', 'Why', 'bother', 'writing', 'lyrics', 'when', 'Ella', 'so', 'well', 'Peggy', 'Lee', 'words', 'music', 'are', 'inseparable', 'inner', 'core', 'song', 'nobody', 'else', 'always', 'touch', 'mystery', 'never', 'overstating', 'case.A', 'delight', 'treasure', 'way', 'disc', 'one', 'jewels', 'collection']",N/A

Peggy Lee has the talent to rivet an audience with her buoyant personality, and swing oh so softly. Every song is perfect--they all stand out. Although Ms. Lee is older and appears a bit too fragile, she knows her way around a song better than most. She is backed by a stellar combo, as well as The NJ Symphony on strings.The audience is a bit subdued until the end of the program, then they show their appreciation in full.The video is clean, the sound is wonderful. This is an addition to any music lover's collection. It states above that this disc is for adults. Further clarification is it is for any serious jazz lover, and music period. It doesn't get any better than this. The only other video commercially available is ""Fever"" dotted with great performances and interrupted and marred by needless voice overs.
