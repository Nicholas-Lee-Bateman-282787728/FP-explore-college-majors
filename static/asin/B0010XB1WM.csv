I think many of the people that didn't like this show didn't understand it.  People don't like to have to think when they watch TV.

As a result, they don't really have much effect on the plot (other than one brief scare). Which makes one wonder why they were written in at all. If Jack has a supernatural ability and is Still boring, than Jack is a Truly dull boy.If you're higher than a kite on reefer like the writers were, this may be for you. Make sure you're properly cooked before watching and stay that way well after, otherwise you're likely to realize that not much of anything is happening in all the sub plots to nowhere. Episode after episode, it looks like something interesting might happen... then it side tracks, new characters and plots are thrown in, the old ones just kind of linger. Eventually the show is full of loose ends and you realize that the writers just don't know what they are doing.Clearly, after doing someone a Huge favor by green-lighting this, the execs tossed in the towel and walked away after 10 episodes.Wondering how they managed to get so many veteran actors to walk through this nonsense is actually the most intriguing thing about the series.",1,Abysmal writing that goes nowhere - Marvelous actors wasted,1381276800,"10 9, 2013",2013,1476,"['Idiot', 'savant', 'stranger', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'mystical', 'abilities', 'small', 'very', 'sleepy', 'California', 'surf', 'mecca', 'town', 'where', 'cast', 'are', 'apparently', 'unemployed', 'spend', 'days', 'surfing', 'smoking', 'pot', 'selling', 'pot', 'randomly', 'bumming', 'spouting', 'philosophical', 'musings.A', 'couple', 'people', 'develop', 'strange', 'supernatural', 'abilities', 'are', 'indifferent', 'more', 'concerned', 'hiding', 'exploring', 'result', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'much', 'effect', 'plot', 'other', 'one', 'brief', 'scare', 'Which', 'one', 'wonder', 'why', 'were', 'written', 'Jack', 'supernatural', 'ability', 'Still', 'boring', 'Jack', 'Truly', 'dull', 'boy.If', ""'re"", 'higher', 'kite', 'reefer', 'writers', 'were', 'may', 'be', 'Make', 'sure', ""'re"", 'properly', 'cooked', 'watching', 'stay', 'way', 'well', 'otherwise', ""'re"", 'likely', 'realize', 'not', 'much', 'anything', 'happening', 'sub', 'plots', 'nowhere', 'Episode', 'episode', 'something', 'interesting', 'might', 'happen', 'then', 'side', 'tracks', 'new', 'characters', 'plots', 'are', 'thrown', 'old', 'ones', 'just', 'kind', 'linger', 'Eventually', 'show', 'full', 'loose', 'ends', 'realize', 'writers', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'are', 'doing.Clearly', 'doing', 'someone', 'Huge', 'favor', 'green-lighting', 'execs', 'tossed', 'towel', 'walked', 'away', '10', 'episodes.Wondering', 'how', 'managed', 'get', 'so', 'many', 'veteran', 'actors', 'walk', 'nonsense', 'actually', 'most', 'intriguing', 'thing', 'series']",John from Cincinnati: Season 1
1127836,AVT9Q9PTUCDMR,B0010XB1WM,Brian Maitland,"[1, 2]","First of all the series lasted just one season and got canceled so don't expect too much closure to the story. There is an ending (or is it a beginning of a new chapter for all these characters?) but I'm not spoiling it for those of you interested in this unique HBO series.Secondly, it takes place in a surfing community but that is really just a porthole into these people's lives. It is more about how preconceived notions can be turned around 180 and a community and family can come together and get past judging people based on their job, choice of lifestyle, appearance, etc. That sounds like a simple and nicely wrapped up synopsis but once you start watching this series, you'll wonder why it takes such a convoluted route to reach that conclusion.""John From Cincy"" is definitely weird and seems like a second division ripoff of ""Twin Peaks,"" but well worth watching mainly because of the interesting characters. I will say although John, as a sort of mirror that reflects back the reality of these people's lives, is the main driving force he is more an annoying Rain Man than anything else.To be honest, the creator of this series comes across like he dropped way too much acid in the '60s and his head is filled with some magical and lyrical poetry that only he can comprehend. When it's spit out onto the screen, it can be thicker than pea soup to paddle through. Not that it's not worth sticking with this series episode to episode. Just be forewarned your brain may explode trying to figure out what it all means.Seeing Luke Perry and a porn actress turned born-again mom become an item, Rebecca de Mornay as a screaming lunatic of a grandma (a grandma?), the guy from WKRP (Howard Hesseman) as an old hippy dippy drug casualty, the ""Married With Children"" dad (Ed O'Neill) as a retired cop who ""talks"" to his pet birds and Carrie's gay friend from ""Sex and the City"" (Greyson Fletcher) as a surf-loving easygoing and nice guy lawyer are all worth the price of admission.The soundtrack is beyond awesome. The opening credit montage with Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros doing ""Johnny Appleseed"" to the closing credits on episode 1 with the awesome ""Sun Rise Light Flies"" by Kasabian as surfers ride those waves is magic. Lastly, the ""sound"" of the surf in beach scenes where no music, no dialogue is on, you can almost feel like it's coming through your TV screen. Very hard to explain but it captures the way beaches are and how powerful the sea is.Now before I go as weird on you, I would say this series is not for everyone and I can understand people tuning out after one or two episodes. My advice is, if you stuck with ""Twin Peaks"" through season two, you can at least give this a shot.",3,a real headscratcher of a series,1321833600,"11 21, 2011",2011,2705,"['First', 'series', 'lasted', 'just', 'one', 'season', 'got', 'canceled', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'closure', 'story', 'ending', 'beginning', 'new', 'chapter', 'characters', ""'m"", 'not', 'spoiling', 'interested', 'unique', 'HBO', 'series.Secondly', 'place', 'surfing', 'community', 'really', 'just', 'porthole', 'people', 'lives', 'more', 'how', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'can', 'be', 'turned', '180', 'community', 'family', 'can', 'come', 'together', 'get', 'past', 'judging', 'people', 'based', 'job', 'choice', 'lifestyle', 'appearance', 'etc', 'simple', 'nicely', 'wrapped', 'up', 'synopsis', 'once', 'start', 'watching', 'series', ""'ll"", 'wonder', 'why', 'convoluted', 'route', 'reach', 'conclusion', 'John', 'From', 'Cincy', 'definitely', 'weird', 'second', 'division', 'ripoff', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'mainly', 'interesting', 'characters', 'will', 'say', 'John', 'sort', 'mirror', 'back', 'reality', 'people', 'lives', 'main', 'driving', 'force', 'more', 'annoying', 'Rain', 'Man', 'anything', 'else.To', 'be', 'honest', 'creator', 'series', 'dropped', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'acid', ""'60s"", 'head', 'filled', 'magical', 'lyrical', 'poetry', 'only', 'can', 'comprehend', 'When', 'spit', 'out', 'screen', 'can', 'be', 'thicker', 'pea', 'soup', 'paddle', 'Not', 'not', 'worth', 'sticking', 'series', 'episode', 'episode', 'Just', 'be', 'forewarned', 'brain', 'may', 'explode', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'means.Seeing', 'Luke', 'Perry', 'porn', 'actress', 'turned', 'born-again', 'mom', 'become', 'item', 'Rebecca', 'de', 'Mornay', 'screaming', 'lunatic', 'grandma', 'grandma', 'guy', 'WKRP', 'Howard', 'Hesseman', 'old', 'hippy', 'dippy', 'drug', 'casualty', 'Married', 'Children', 'dad', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'retired', 'cop', 'who', 'talks', 'pet', 'birds', 'Carrie', 'gay', 'friend', 'Sex', 'City', 'Greyson', 'Fletcher', 'surf-loving', 'easygoing', 'nice', 'guy', 'lawyer', 'are', 'price', 'admission.The', 'soundtrack', 'awesome', 'opening', 'credit', 'montage', 'Joe', 'Strummer', 'Mescaleros', 'doing', 'Johnny', 'Appleseed', 'closing', 'credits', 'episode', '1', 'awesome', 'Sun', 'Rise', 'Light', 'Flies', 'Kasabian', 'surfers', 'ride', 'waves', 'magic', 'Lastly', 'sound', 'surf', 'beach', 'scenes', 'where', 'music', 'dialogue', 'can', 'almost', 'feel', 'coming', 'TV', 'screen', 'Very', 'hard', 'explain', 'way', 'beaches', 'are', 'how', 'powerful', 'sea', 'is.Now', 'go', 'weird', 'would', 'say', 'series', 'not', 'everyone', 'can', 'understand', 'people', 'tuning', 'out', 'one', 'two', 'episodes', 'advice', 'stuck', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'season', 'two', 'can', 'least', 'give', 'shot']",John from Cincinnati: Season 1

This show never got off the ground, it was bad from the beginning - and I watched the whole series.  The dialog is so ""cutting edge"" (they're speaking ""Imperial Beach-ese"", or ""IB"" as they call it because they're all so cool) that they might as well be speaking a foreign language.  I love foreign films, but not when they're speaking English.  Most of the characters have no purpose at all to the story (what little story there is, and even that's not interesting), including the title character.  It's never really explained who he is - from God?  An alien? - but that's OK.  Then you have three generations of professional surfers - a grandfather, a father who's a heroin addict, and a son played by one of the worst kid actors I've ever seen.  I winced almost every time he spoke.  Then you have Rebecca de Mornay in an awful, awful role as the angriest, most foul-mouthed grandmother in TV history.  I don't think once in all 10 episodes did they show her smile - she literally constantly had a scowl on her face and was usually yelling at someone.  And I like Rebecca de Mornay, so I hated that.  I only finished the show because of the money I spent on it and it was short - I had lost interest by the second or third episode and it never got better.  Only two or three noteworthy things happened in the whole series.  I started to listen to the commentary on the first episode, by the creator David Milch, but didn't finish - he's a very angry, cynical man, and just scary - I very much disliked listening to him (part of his commentary was mentioning that he'd love to follow someone home who'd cut him off on the highway and kill them - or maybe it was beat the crap out of them, I don't remember.)  In episode 7, I think, there was a ""dream"" - not really, but everyone ended up in the same place talking real, true nonsense.  In an extra Milch explained, to the actors and to us, what all the gibberish meant.  It was just as confusing as the gibberish itself.  Leave this one alone.  Don't even buy it used.

Speaking of the characters, there are some classic ones, like ""Barry the Fairy,"" who won the Mega-Millions after an epileptic vision gave him the winning numbers. Butchy Yost walks the tightrope between humor and tragedy like few characters on any series. Also impressive is the way JFC captures the Imperial Beach atmosphere.

1127845,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B0010XB1WM,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[3, 3]","The Yosts are a dysunctional family that contains three generations of surfing royalty. Mitch Yost (Bruce Greenwood), the patriarch, is a surfing champ whose career was ended by an injury; Butch Yost (Brian Van Holt), Mitch's son, who seemed poised to follow in his father's footsteps until his career was cut short by drug addiction; and Shaun Yost (Greyson Fletcher), Butch's son, who is known as a surfing prodigy but is hampered from joining contests by his guardian Mitch who doesn't want to see him follow in his or Butch's footsteps. But when the mysterious John (Austin Nichols) shows up their lives are changed by miracles and other occurences that bring them closer together.David Milch is a god of television. Milch created such powerhouses as Deadwood and NYPD Blue, as well as writing for shows as LA Law, Brooklyn South, and Hill Street Blues. His love for language makes for some of the most colorful scripts you will ever hear committed to the screen as can be attested to by anyone who's watched Deadwood (if you haven't watched it, go check it out today). After Deadwood ended in it's third season, Milch went on to work on John From Cincinnati. Utilizing a lot of the same actors as can be seen in Deadwood, with a few fresh faces that you'll recognize from other TV shows and movies, John From Cincinnati is a very ambitious TV show that appears to only have lasted one season. The big question is: did it deserve more.I would say so. John From Cincinnati is brilliantly written taking twists and turns not common for TV, making it a very original show. Touching on moments of existentialism, belief in God, drug abuse, redemption, and so on, John From Cincinnati is the type of show I wish would be made more often. The characters are well developed, with their own quirks, hangups, and problems that all feel real and fit the actors perfectly, and the storyline takes twists and turns that you'd never expect. This isn't your typical cliched television show.The acting is superb, and in many cases I would say that it's some of it's actors best work. Of these, the two standouts in my mind are Ed O'Neill and Brian Van Holt. Ed O'Neill as Bill Jacks, a former cop and friend of the Yosts, plays a man who is still adjusting to life without a badge and without his wife. He gets the meatiest lines of the show, and, in my opinion, gives some of his best acting work apart from his performance as the patriarch in Modern Family. Brian Van Holt has a little more of a wall to climb playing the drug addicted failure of a son who's heard one too man times that he's a loser and needs to get off the drugs, but the way he portrays it makes you feel every tick from messed up to jonesing and beyond. You feel him when he tries to redeem himself and find his way back into a better relationship with his son.But I have to fault the series for being a bit too impenetrable at times and even a tad bit pretentious. At times the show is too clever and self aware of it, Milch and his writing seem to be trying to send a message, and try to hard to rap the message in an enigma in something of an attempt to show off. I still can't tell you that I know what all of it means, and maybe I will eventually figure it out on future viewings and while the rewatchability factor is a strength of the show, it's also it's weakness.All in all, I would highly recommend the show. The dialogue is brilliant and just fun to listen to, and the acting is superb. The movie works on various levels from comedy to drama and beyond and is highly entertaining.4/5",4,John From Cincinnati Season 1,1262476800,"01 3, 2010",2010,3556,"['Yosts', 'are', 'dysunctional', 'family', 'three', 'generations', 'surfing', 'royalty', 'Mitch', 'Yost', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'patriarch', 'surfing', 'champ', 'career', 'was', 'ended', 'injury', 'Butch', 'Yost', 'Brian', 'Van', 'Holt', 'Mitch', 'son', 'who', 'seemed', 'poised', 'follow', 'father', 'footsteps', 'career', 'was', 'cut', 'short', 'drug', 'addiction', 'Shaun', 'Yost', 'Greyson', 'Fletcher', 'Butch', 'son', 'who', 'known', 'surfing', 'prodigy', 'hampered', 'joining', 'contests', 'guardian', 'Mitch', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'follow', 'Butch', 'footsteps', 'when', 'mysterious', 'John', 'Austin', 'Nichols', 'up', 'lives', 'are', 'changed', 'miracles', 'other', 'occurences', 'bring', 'closer', 'together.David', 'Milch', 'god', 'television', 'Milch', 'created', 'such', 'powerhouses', 'Deadwood', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'as', 'well', 'writing', 'shows', 'LA', 'Law', 'Brooklyn', 'South', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'love', 'language', 'most', 'colorful', 'scripts', 'will', 'ever', 'hear', 'committed', 'screen', 'can', 'be', 'attested', 'anyone', 'who', 'watched', 'Deadwood', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'go', 'check', 'out', 'today', 'Deadwood', 'ended', 'third', 'season', 'Milch', 'went', 'work', 'John', 'From', 'Cincinnati', 'Utilizing', 'lot', 'same', 'actors', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'Deadwood', 'few', 'fresh', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'other', 'TV', 'shows', 'movies', 'John', 'From', 'Cincinnati', 'very', 'ambitious', 'TV', 'show', 'only', 'have', 'lasted', 'one', 'season', 'big', 'question', 'did', 'deserve', 'more.I', 'would', 'say', 'so', 'John', 'From', 'Cincinnati', 'brilliantly', 'written', 'taking', 'twists', 'not', 'common', 'TV', 'making', 'very', 'original', 'show', 'Touching', 'moments', 'existentialism', 'belief', 'God', 'drug', 'abuse', 'redemption', 'so', 'John', 'From', 'Cincinnati', 'type', 'show', 'wish', 'would', 'be', 'made', 'more', 'often', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'developed', 'own', 'quirks', 'hangups', 'problems', 'feel', 'real', 'fit', 'actors', 'perfectly', 'storyline', 'twists', ""'d"", 'never', 'expect', ""n't"", 'typical', 'cliched', 'television', 'show.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'many', 'cases', 'would', 'say', 'actors', 'best', 'work', 'two', 'standouts', 'mind', 'are', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'Brian', 'Van', 'Holt', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'Bill', 'Jacks', 'former', 'cop', 'friend', 'Yosts', 'man', 'who', 'still', 'adjusting', 'life', 'badge', 'wife', 'meatiest', 'lines', 'show', 'opinion', 'best', 'acting', 'work', 'apart', 'performance', 'patriarch', 'Modern', 'Family', 'Brian', 'Van', 'Holt', 'little', 'more', 'wall', 'climb', 'playing', 'drug', 'addicted', 'failure', 'son', 'who', 'heard', 'one', 'too', 'man', 'times', 'loser', 'get', 'off', 'drugs', 'way', 'feel', 'tick', 'messed', 'up', 'jonesing', 'feel', 'when', 'redeem', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'better', 'relationship', 'son.But', 'have', 'fault', 'series', 'being', 'bit', 'too', 'impenetrable', 'times', 'even', 'tad', 'bit', 'pretentious', 'times', 'show', 'too', 'clever', 'self', 'aware', 'Milch', 'writing', 'seem', 'be', 'trying', 'send', 'message', 'try', 'hard', 'rap', 'message', 'enigma', 'something', 'attempt', 'show', 'off', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'know', 'what', 'maybe', 'will', 'eventually', 'figure', 'out', 'future', 'viewings', 'rewatchability', 'factor', 'strength', 'show', 'also', 'weakness.All', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'show', 'dialogue', 'brilliant', 'just', 'fun', 'listen', 'acting', 'superb', 'movie', 'various', 'levels', 'comedy', 'drama', 'highly', 'entertaining.4/5']",John from Cincinnati: Season 1

1127847,A2MZ1VBYTQ7MO5,B0010XB1WM,Joseph Haggard Jr.,"[5, 20]","When I was on vacation last summer in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, me and my family stayed at a hotel in Sault Saint Marie. The TV in the hotel room had cable, including HBO. On this particular night I was flicking through all the channels looking for something to watch, and I came across an episode of HBO's newest series at the time, ""John from Cincinnati"". I had heard from a few TV critics that this show wasn't very good. But I decided to watch the episode that aired, and it looked like an interesting show. So when it came out on DVD, I wanted to get it so that I could watch all 10 episodes. Well I have seen all 10 episodes, and I have to give ""John from Cincinnati"" a mixed review.This very strange and bizarre series takes place over nine eventful days as we follow an assortment of characters from Imperial Beach, California (a town which lies south of San Diego and north of the U.S.-Mexico border). Much of the action focuses on the very dysfunctional Yost family, which has three generations of surfers. The patriarch is Mitch Yost, who was once a top-notch surfer until an injury cut his surfing career short. Eventually he passed his surfing genes onto his son Butchie, who turned out to be a very good surfer as well. But things started to go downhill for Butchie when he started using drugs, which (as the show starts) is ruining his life. While Mitch is the first Yost surfer and Butchie the second Yost surfer, the third Yost surfer comes in the form of Butchie's teenage son Shaun, who is being raised by Mitch and his wife Cissy, since Butchie's drug use puts him in no condition to raise his own son. Shaun loves surfing and wants to follow in his father's and grandfather's footsteps. The Yost clan owns a surf shop which Cissy runs along with Kai, a female surfer (and family friend of the Yost's) who occasionally looks after Shaun and has a sweet little relationship with Butchie. Other acquaintances of the Yost family include retired police officer Bill Jacks, who spends most of his time talking to his bird Zippy; Ramon, the manager of an old, broken down motel where Butchie is currently living; and Linc Stark, a surfing agent who once represented Butchie and is now pursuing to represent Shaun. Other characters include Cass, a young woman who (in the beginning) poses as a filmmaker working for Linc; Barry Cunningham, the new owner of that run down motel; Meyer Dickstein, another motel employee who usually works alongside Ramon; Tina Blake, a porn actress who happens to be Shaun's mother; Steady Freddy Lopez, a criminal who has a past with Butchie; and Palaka, Freddy's henchman. Their lives are all pretty much routine, that is until a mysterious stranger appears and proceeds to change their lives. That stranger is John Monad (aka John from Cincinnati). He's very dim, acts childlike much of the time, and constantly mimics the words of what the other characters around him say to his face. John repeatedly says things to people as if the world is coming to an end or something. Not to mention spiritual situations start happening to some of the members of the Yost clan. For example, in the first episode Mitch discovers that he can hover several inches off the ground, which he has no idea why. Also in episode one a dead bird comes back to life. In episode two a surfer suffers a life-threatening injury and ends up in a coma. The same bird gives that injured surfer a peck on the cheek and immediately wakes up and is completely healed. Is John the one behind all of this? Is he some supernatural force that needs to be reckoned with?Throughout the 10 episodes, I found ""John from Cincinnati"" to run hot and cold. I thought the first three episodes were pretty good as I got to know these people. Then the show when kind of dull with the next four episodes, before finally coming back for a bright wrap-up with the final three episodes. The cast features some good acting from the cast, but I found only two characters to be truly memorable: teenage surfer Shaun Yost and retired cop Bill Jacks. These two characters are brought to life by two terrific actors: one a newcomer and the other a TV veteran (who made us laugh for over ten years playing one of the most popular TV patriarchs of all time). The newcomer is Greyson Fletcher, who in real life is a teen skater and gets to display some of that talent in a few episodes of this show. ""John from Cincinnati"" marks his acting debut and he does a terrific job in his first time out as an actor. I look forward to seeing more of this young talent in the years to come. The TV veteran who comes off great on this show is Ed O'Neill, who if you remember played the occasionally grouchy Al Bundy for 11 seasons on the popular '80s-'90s sitcom ""Married with Children"". O'Neill is on hand to provide most of the comic relief here, and as usual does a great job. The best scenes of this show are the ones where Shaun and Bill are on screen together. Those moments are wonderful. Only problem is there's not enough of them. I would have liked to have seen more scenes with Fletcher and O'Neill onscreen together, but unfortunately that doesn't happen, and that's because there are way too many unnecessary characters that we have to get to know, and I feel that they really don't need to be here. And that's the first of many problems that ""John from Cincinnati"" has.Bruce Greenwood and Rebecca De Mornay are good as the head of the Yost clan, but they have been better in other projects in the past. Plus I was constantly laughing every time the Rebecca De Mornay character got angry, which was quite often. Did the writers have to make her character (Cissy) so mad almost all the time? (Get a load of one scene early in episode five -- the trailer sequence -- where De Mornay overacts so uproariously that it made me laugh out loud to the point where I had to stop the DVD because it made me laugh so hard.) Same goes for Brian Van Holt, who plays Butchie. In the first episode, Van Holt acts so angry most of the time that I thought this was going to be one of the most aggravating characters in television history. But as the show progressed over the next nine episodes, his character actually settled down and didn't act so mad as he did in episode one. This makes the Cissy Yost character the angriest one on the show. But to be perfectly honest, ""John from Cincinnati"" does work when the focus is on the Yost family. When the focus is on Mitch, Cissy, Butchie, Shaun, Bill the cop, Kai the surfer girl (played by another newcomer, Keala Kennelly), Tina the porn actress (played by Chandra West, who doesn't appear until episode four), and the mysterious John (played by Austin Nichols, who plays the childlike role well by not going over the top), the show is at its best. The show is at its worst when it focuses on all the other characters, mainly the ones at that motel. Luis Guzman (Ramon) is a good actor and I've liked him in the past, but he really doesn't belong here. He's actually good on this show, but to what point? He's stuck in the most uninteresting part of the show. The two other characters at that motel (employee Meyer and owner Barry) aren't very interesting either. And that leads to the two most annoying characters on the whole show: the criminals Steady Freddy Lopez and his henchman Palaka, who just happen to be rooming at that same motel. It drove me crazy watching these two guys interact on the screen, and they almost single handedly ruin the show. Take these two characters out of ""John from Cincinnati"" and the show would get four stars.But in the end, I can only give ""John from Cincinnati"" three stars. And that's too bad. This show had potential. There are many good things about it. But in the end there was just too much, and some of the things on hand weren't that great, and that includes the fantasy element. This is a drama series that throws in a few fantasy moments just to grab our attention, and it really doesn't work. Ironically, this show made its debut just after the final episode of ""The Sopranos"" ended. Most ""Sopranos"" viewers were so ticked off by the ending of that series that they didn't even bother to check this series out. In fact a lot of people didn't bother to check this series out. Reviews were mostly bad, and it never caught fire in the ratings. ""John from Cincinnati"" was cancelled after the final episode aired, and maybe that was for the best. This show was far from being a classic, but I think if it had to be reworked into a better show, I believe it might work as a half-hour comedy series. Just get rid of the unnecessary characters (about half of them), focus on the Yost clan and a few of their friends, and you might have something.",3,John from Cincinnati - The Complete

The mini-series starts out well.  Interesting quirky characters and a bit of magical realism.  If you are a fan of Kem Nun's surf fiction, you will appreciate the concept of the show.Sadly, about half-way through, the show looses its way.  Magical realism, like chili pepper, is best used sparingly.  Toward the end, JFC becomes fully surreal.  Not that I mind surrealism ... but the change from light magical realism to full-blown surrealism left me feeling dis-jointed and confused.The other disappointment was the characterization.  Over the course of the show, quirky characters become downright annoying.  Rebecca De Mornay is a good actress.  Her character is believable and multi-faceted at the start.  Yet by the end she is reduced to playing a caricature who screams and cusses her way through every episode.John visits profound revelations upon the characters which might cause deeply transformative experiences ... yet in spite of profound revelations about her past, DeMornay's character becomes predictable, boring, and annoying.Likewise, the possibly homosexual ""hoods"" from Hawaii.  Their characters are like bad mental slapstick - they might provide comic relief but they are too annoying to be really funny.John From Cincinnati had real promise, but didn't live-up to its potential ... ironically like the surfers it portrays.  My BF would give it 4 stars b/c it has some good surf scenes and you will ""recognize"" some of these ""beach type"" characters if you surf in SoCali.
