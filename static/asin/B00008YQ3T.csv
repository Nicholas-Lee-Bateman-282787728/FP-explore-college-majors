I could have done a better job years with the free software that came on my laptop. I hear the Canadian version is better? But this is the one I could get. I love the show even after all these years and only wish that it had lasted longer. The tv movie comes with it so don't buy that seperate. I paid about twenty, if could do it over I would have waited till it droped down to ten because the menu is terrible.
