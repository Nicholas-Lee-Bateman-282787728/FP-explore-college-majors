I found this film very real, emotionally stimulating and totally thought provoking.  From the beginning I was caught up and the experience was a honest, heart wrenching experience.All the acting here is superb.  Heather Graham leads the cast in an amazing performance as a very mysterious eye doctor.  Add in Victor Rasuk in a career making performance as a 20 year old photographer who becomes obsessed with her and Dominic Chianese as one of her patients who is also excellent.  All the characters here are shown very realistically and their lives are troubled and multi layered.  The script as well as the directing desrve high credit here.  We become involved and totally invested in these peoples lives.  They are introduced vaguely and as the film progresses we discover all about their lives and the complexities of the issues they are all dealing with.This was truly one of the best films I have seen in a long time.  It is very intelligent and the way all the characters lives become entwined is very believable.  This film was an emotional journey I will not soon forget.  ADRIFT IN MANHATTAN does not manipulate the emotions of the viewer but rather tells the stories openly and honestly and allows the viewer to feel their own emotions.I truly don't understand the low ratings here.  I highly praise this film and also highly recommend it.

A little wierd also in the sense that this eye doctor is being stalked by a very quiet man in his early 20s and she is eventually ok with it.  I won't spoil what happens with the stalker but the result is kind of weird.

1112197,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000WTZ6RG,Grady Harp,"[16, 20]","Though there have been many films of late that address the issues of the isolation of the individual in a society increasingly settling for homogeneity, few have the honesty and simplicity of presentation as Alfredo De Villa's ADRIFT IN MANHATTAN.  Perhaps the reason this film works so well is that instead of dealing with the usual tropes, De Villa restricts his story to three individuals who are suffering isolation in the noise and autonomy of New York City and are thus 'adrift' in a life that seems flat and without a beacon of hope.  The story De Villa weaves is one of interaction of these characters by almost serendipitous incidents, moments that change their lives - at least for a while.Teenager Simon Colon (Victor Rasuk) lives with his overbearing mother Marta (Marlene Forte) and gets through his life almost without speaking, working in a camera shop, spending his idle hours photographing people in the park. Tommaso Pensara (Dominic Chianese) is an elderly painter and music lover who lives alone and supports himself by being the 'mail boy' in a large firm: his loneliness is heightened when he discovers he has macular degeneration and will go blind.  The physician who makes his diagnosis is Dr. Rose Phipps (Heather Graham) who is grieving from the recent death of her 2-year old child and is unable to continue her marriage to literature professor Mark Phipps (William Baldwin).The threads of coincidence begin to tie these people together when Simon begins to photograph Rose in a manner that resembles stalking, when Tommaso notices and desires and older lady at his workplace, Isabel Parades (Elizabeth Pe&ntilde;a) and is encouraged by Dr Rose to share his potential blindness with this friend, and when Rose explores the attention Simon bestows on her, filling an emotional need for both parties.  Naturally the development of these intersections is more complex but at the same time the manner in which they develop is very tender and gentle.Some viewers may find the film meandering a bit too much: this is not linear storytelling but rather shifts in incidents and moods and gradual changes that occur among these simple but needy people, much like the coincidences and random kindnesses occur to the sensitive eye.  The cast is very fine and the cinematography and musical score sustain the mood of the piece.  This film requires involvement on the part of the viewer, and that involvement has its rewards.

However, by the time the telling is done, you discover that the story was not being woven, but was actually unraveling instead, as each thread of the story ends disappointingly and unsatisfyingly. I got a feeling that the moral of the story is that life has no purpose, so just give up. It is not inspiring at all, as one reviewer suggested, but instead is very, very depressing. If you are contemplating suicide and looking for a movie that will cheer you up or give you some hope, I recommend you do not watch this one.Other reviewers have suggested that this movie reveals truths about the secret lives of disconnected people, but I hope there are not really Mothers out there who want to seduce their developmentally disabled adult children, or Mothers who have feelings of guilt over the loss of a child and who want to solve that by inviting developmentally disabled strangers to rape and otherwise hurt them.I am also somewhat surprised that other reviews did not bother to mention the very graphic rape/sex scene as well as numerous other scenes that would be highly offensive to people who are not expecting to see that kind of thing in an ""art movie"", which is what I think this movie is trying to be.",1,Made My Short List of Movies Not Worth Watching,1332115200,"03 19, 2012",2012,1970,"['box', 'movie', 'unrated', 'should', 'just', 'be', 'honest', 'say', 'Rated', 'R', 'strong', 'deviant', 'graphic', 'sexuality', 'so', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'would', 'have', 'idea', 'might', 'want', 'skip', 'one.The', 'box', 'Award', 'Winning', 'examination', 'claim', 'was', 'unable', 'discover', 'what', 'award', 'awards', 'might', 'be.The', 'box', 'critics', 'have', 'been', 'raving', 'movie', 'watching', 'am', 'pretty', 'sure', 'understand', 'why', 'listing', 'names', 'critics.For', 'most', 'part', 'acting', 'directing', 'cinematography', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'sense', 'watching', 'discussed', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'very', 'important', 'story', 'being', 'artfully', 'woven', 'together', 'interesting', 'compelling', 'way', 'However', 'time', 'telling', 'done', 'discover', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'being', 'woven', 'was', 'actually', 'unraveling', 'instead', 'thread', 'story', 'disappointingly', 'unsatisfyingly', 'got', 'feeling', 'moral', 'story', 'life', 'purpose', 'so', 'just', 'give', 'up', 'not', 'inspiring', 'one', 'reviewer', 'suggested', 'instead', 'very', 'very', 'depressing', 'are', 'contemplating', 'suicide', 'looking', 'movie', 'will', 'cheer', 'up', 'give', 'hope', 'recommend', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'one.Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'suggested', 'movie', 'truths', 'secret', 'lives', 'disconnected', 'people', 'hope', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'Mothers', 'there', 'who', 'want', 'seduce', 'developmentally', 'disabled', 'adult', 'children', 'Mothers', 'who', 'have', 'feelings', 'guilt', 'loss', 'child', 'who', 'want', 'solve', 'inviting', 'developmentally', 'disabled', 'strangers', 'rape', 'otherwise', 'hurt', 'them.I', 'am', 'also', 'somewhat', 'surprised', 'other', 'reviews', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'mention', 'very', 'graphic', 'rape/sex', 'scene', 'as', 'well', 'numerous', 'other', 'scenes', 'would', 'be', 'highly', 'offensive', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'expecting', 'see', 'kind', 'thing', 'art', 'movie', 'what', 'think', 'movie', 'trying', 'be']",N/A

There was a lovely mysterious mood created in the beginning when we see a young Puerto Rican fellow follow an older beautiful blond woman and take pictures of her.  He is quite nice-looking himself which adds to the enjoyment of the film.  The blond turns out to be an eye doctor and treats an elderly man who is losing his eyesight.  He works as a mail deliverer in an agency but is really a serious painter at night.  He becomes involved with a younger woman who works at the agency.  Then we see the separated husband of the eye doctor and the  very disturbed mother of the photographer.  The film shows how their lives connect.  It's a device that has been used elsewhere to great effect and here it is nicely done, too.Although I liked it while watching it, a few hours later, it had left my mind, like a frothy dessert with no substance.  The relationship of the young photographer to his mother is quite disturbing and then he has another disturbing encounter with the eye doctor.  It all rings true but it may bother some viewers.The film is visually appealing, from its New York City setting to the actors, most of whom are very good looking.  The female star, whose name I've already forgotten, is quite stunning but her voice is flat and without much expression.  The young photographer has very few lines but has a beautifully expressive face.  The older man is also quite beautiful, I found. Even the insane mother of the photographer is very attractive.  Most of the supporting actors looked good, too.  So if you're visually oriented as I am, you may give an extra star as I did, for its look.  It's interesting how the eye features prominently in the film---the eye doctor, the painter who's losing his sight and the photographer who uses his camera as a way to connect with the world.  Whether this is intentional of not I don't know.  I still think that, as appealing at the film is on the surface that is lacks the emotional depth that would make it more important and memorable.",3,Nice idea --but more style than substance,1388793600,"01 4, 2014",2014,2062,"['found', 'film', 'interesting', 'enough', 'sit', 'end', 'was', 'lovely', 'mysterious', 'mood', 'created', 'beginning', 'when', 'see', 'young', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'fellow', 'follow', 'older', 'beautiful', 'blond', 'woman', 'take', 'pictures', 'quite', 'nice-looking', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'blond', 'out', 'be', 'eye', 'doctor', 'elderly', 'man', 'who', 'losing', 'eyesight', 'mail', 'deliverer', 'agency', 'really', 'serious', 'painter', 'night', 'involved', 'younger', 'woman', 'who', 'agency', 'Then', 'see', 'separated', 'husband', 'eye', 'doctor', 'very', 'disturbed', 'mother', 'photographer', 'film', 'how', 'lives', 'connect', 'device', 'been', 'used', 'elsewhere', 'great', 'effect', 'here', 'nicely', 'done', 'liked', 'watching', 'few', 'hours', 'later', 'had', 'left', 'mind', 'frothy', 'dessert', 'substance', 'relationship', 'young', 'photographer', 'mother', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'then', 'disturbing', 'encounter', 'eye', 'doctor', 'rings', 'true', 'may', 'bother', 'viewers.The', 'film', 'visually', 'appealing', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'setting', 'actors', 'most', 'whom', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'looking', 'female', 'star', 'name', ""'ve"", 'already', 'forgotten', 'quite', 'stunning', 'voice', 'flat', 'much', 'expression', 'young', 'photographer', 'very', 'few', 'lines', 'beautifully', 'expressive', 'face', 'older', 'man', 'also', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'found', 'Even', 'insane', 'mother', 'photographer', 'very', 'attractive', 'Most', 'supporting', 'actors', 'looked', 'good', 'too', 'So', ""'re"", 'visually', 'oriented', 'am', 'may', 'give', 'extra', 'star', 'did', 'look', 'interesting', 'how', 'eye', 'prominently', 'film', 'eye', 'doctor', 'painter', 'who', 'losing', 'sight', 'photographer', 'who', 'camera', 'way', 'connect', 'world', 'intentional', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'still', 'think', 'that', 'appealing', 'film', 'surface', 'emotional', 'depth', 'would', 'make', 'more', 'important', 'memorable']",N/A
