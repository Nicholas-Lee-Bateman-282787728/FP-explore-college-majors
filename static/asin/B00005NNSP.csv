Sloan ""thegreyfox""","[2, 3]","Anyone buying this DVD and seeing the date on it, and expecting state of that art concert sound and video, will get what they deserve. Neither.Anyone with no particular knowledge of Rory Gallagher the man, but with a love for the music he played on this tour will probably be better off with the CD ( and a great CD it is too ! ) .. prabably his least ""bluesy"" recordingBut anyone who was touched by Rory Gallagher, and appreciated, loved and respected everything he was, stood and worked for, will not be watching this video with a critical eye, but probably a misty one.This ""film"" (if you consider it a documentary rather than a concert video, you will feel more comfortable with the quality issues ) shows our modest hero performing a fantastic concert('s actually), in times and conditions that you could not possibly contemplate having listened to the CD. How can such a great concert come from town halls with no facilities, bouncers telling kids to sit down, a 13amp extension board for all the power .... it is an amazing tribute to the band that they produced such an incendiary set from such basic ammenities. I bought this DVD at the same time as aerosmith, Ha ! .... talk about POLAR opposites in terms of resources. ( no criticism of Steve and the boys, BTW)The sound in this film is actually really good .. Rod D'arths drumming is actually brilliant despite the fact that he looks like he is going to burst into tears at any moment. Lou Martin is no mean keyboard player either and all round, these were some HUGELY talented guys.I dont care if the thing is not up to todays standards technically ... it is like comparing the original KING KING movie to ther latest version. The original may look a bit dated, but it had originality, flare, imagination, enthusiasm and energy and all the modern recording capabilities will NEVER make up for the lack in any of those departments.I will never listen to ""Irish tour 1974"" again without seeing this film, and for that, it is worth every penny.",4,Can I just put my rose tinted glasses away ?,1165190400,"12 4, 2006",2006,2004,"['Anyone', 'buying', 'DVD', 'seeing', 'date', 'expecting', 'state', 'art', 'concert', 'sound', 'video', 'will', 'get', 'what', 'deserve', 'Neither.Anyone', 'particular', 'knowledge', 'Rory', 'Gallagher', 'man', 'love', 'music', 'played', 'tour', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'CD', 'great', 'CD', 'too', '..', 'prabably', 'least', 'bluesy', 'recordingBut', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'touched', 'Rory', 'Gallagher', 'appreciated', 'loved', 'respected', 'everything', 'was', 'stood', 'worked', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'watching', 'video', 'critical', 'eye', 'probably', 'misty', 'film', 'consider', 'documentary', 'rather', 'concert', 'video', 'will', 'feel', 'more', 'comfortable', 'quality', 'issues', 'modest', 'hero', 'performing', 'fantastic', 'concert', 'actually', 'times', 'conditions', 'could', 'not', 'possibly', 'contemplate', 'having', 'listened', 'CD', 'How', 'can', 'such', 'great', 'concert', 'come', 'town', 'halls', 'facilities', 'bouncers', 'telling', 'kids', 'sit', 'down', '13amp', 'extension', 'board', 'power', 'amazing', 'tribute', 'band', 'produced', 'incendiary', 'set', 'such', 'basic', 'ammenities', 'bought', 'DVD', 'same', 'time', 'aerosmith', 'Ha', 'talk', 'POLAR', 'opposites', 'terms', 'resources', 'criticism', 'Steve', 'boys', 'BTW', 'sound', 'film', 'actually', 'really', 'good', '..', 'Rod', ""D'arths"", 'drumming', 'actually', 'brilliant', 'fact', 'going', 'burst', 'tears', 'moment', 'Lou', 'Martin', 'mean', 'keyboard', 'player', 'round', 'were', 'HUGELY', 'talented', 'guys.I', 'dont', 'care', 'thing', 'not', 'up', 'todays', 'standards', 'technically', 'comparing', 'original', 'KING', 'KING', 'movie', 'ther', 'latest', 'version', 'original', 'may', 'look', 'bit', 'dated', 'had', 'originality', 'flare', 'imagination', 'enthusiasm', 'energy', 'modern', 'recording', 'capabilities', 'will', 'NEVER', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'departments.I', 'will', 'never', 'listen', 'Irish', 'tour', '1974', 'again', 'seeing', 'film', 'worth', 'penny']",Rory Gallagher - Irish Tour 1974

669483,A2TVMU7XUQ61RX,B00005NNSP,"Kevin W. Burdeshaw ""Kevin""","[0, 0]","This is probably the best music DVD that I have ever watched. This shows Rory Gallagher from the very beginning to almost the very end of his life. It shows with the changes in equipment times of prosperity, and periods of time with low amounts of money.It doesn't matter what year of the DVD that you are watching, you will get a rip-roaring good concert, and I guarantee you that.Rory Gallagher, to me, was one of the very best guitarists of all time.The day that Rory died was one of the very saddest days of my life, along with the death of Jimi Hendrix, in 1970.The world lost one of the very nicest performers that ever graced the stages around the world.He was always very shy, but he could play any of the mryiad types and styles of guitar based rock and roll.The way that Rory was able to make that beat-up Stratocaster sing, was just amazing. Rory was never one to play, using flashy or new guitars. Throughout his too short career, he stuck with that Stratocaster which now resides with Rory's brother in Ireland. There are many guitarists playing now who were very much influenced by Rory's playing style.One that is now one of the most well known guitarists, The Edge, shaped a lot of his playing style, from listening and watching Rory.Too me, this DVD was worth at least 3 times the price that they are charging for it. I just wish that during his life, that he would have known just what he meant to this world.His straight Blues playing, and his impeccable slide playing was just masterful.I watch this DVD at least once every week without fail. If you buy this DVD, I truly believe that you will get as much enjoyment out of it as I do.",5,The most underrated guitarist in the world!,1199059200,"12 31, 2007",2007,1654,"['probably', 'best', 'music', 'DVD', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'Rory', 'Gallagher', 'very', 'beginning', 'almost', 'very', 'end', 'life', 'changes', 'equipment', 'times', 'prosperity', 'periods', 'time', 'low', 'amounts', 'money.It', ""n't"", 'matter', 'what', 'year', 'DVD', 'are', 'watching', 'will', 'get', 'rip-roaring', 'good', 'concert', 'guarantee', 'that.Rory', 'Gallagher', 'was', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'guitarists', 'time.The', 'day', 'Rory', 'died', 'was', 'one', 'very', 'saddest', 'days', 'life', 'death', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', '1970.The', 'world', 'lost', 'one', 'very', 'nicest', 'performers', 'ever', 'graced', 'stages', 'world.He', 'was', 'always', 'very', 'shy', 'could', 'play', 'mryiad', 'types', 'styles', 'guitar', 'based', 'rock', 'roll.The', 'way', 'Rory', 'was', 'able', 'make', 'beat-up', 'Stratocaster', 'sing', 'was', 'just', 'amazing', 'Rory', 'was', 'never', 'one', 'play', 'using', 'flashy', 'new', 'guitars', 'too', 'short', 'career', 'stuck', 'Stratocaster', 'now', 'Rory', 'brother', 'Ireland', 'are', 'many', 'guitarists', 'playing', 'now', 'who', 'were', 'very', 'much', 'influenced', 'Rory', 'playing', 'style.One', 'now', 'one', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'guitarists', 'Edge', 'shaped', 'lot', 'playing', 'style', 'listening', 'watching', 'Rory.Too', 'DVD', 'was', 'worth', 'least', '3', 'times', 'price', 'are', 'charging', 'just', 'wish', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'just', 'what', 'meant', 'world.His', 'straight', 'Blues', 'playing', 'impeccable', 'slide', 'playing', 'was', 'just', 'masterful.I', 'watch', 'DVD', 'least', 'once', 'week', 'fail', 'buy', 'DVD', 'truly', 'believe', 'will', 'get', 'as', 'much', 'enjoyment', 'do']",Rory Gallagher - Irish Tour 1974
669484,A1BLRXV5QA2LXX,B00005NNSP,MungoB,"[18, 18]","Anyone who's a big fan of blues-rock or guitar-hero rock of the sixties and seventies should get a huge thrill out of this gem. It begins with scenes of the sea thrusting into the Irish coast and then makes its way into a spellbound onstage version of 'Walk On Hot Coals'. Rory Gallagher was definitely the most under-rated blues-rock guitarist of all time; this DVD is proof of it. His style and tone are both blustery and unrefined, but natural and brown-toned as well. His band of himself on vocal and guitar (mainly a strat player), Gerry McAvoy (bass), Lou Martin (piano), and Rod de'Ath (drums), is loud and raw blues-rock heaven. The backstage interviews are interesting, too, as they show how electrified and personable he was. It's blatantly obvious how much he loved playing live by the huge smile on his face and the way he interacts with the crowd. The scenes of Belfast and the rough old Irish nightclubs and venues just add to the raw beauty of the music. This one will be all worn out by the time I'm done watching it and listening to it. It's one of my favorite DVDs.",5,Raw and magical!,1025481600,"07 1, 2002",2002,1083,"['Anyone', 'who', 'big', 'fan', 'blues-rock', 'guitar-hero', 'rock', 'sixties', 'seventies', 'should', 'get', 'huge', 'thrill', 'gem', 'scenes', 'sea', 'thrusting', 'Irish', 'coast', 'then', 'way', 'spellbound', 'onstage', 'version', ""'Walk"", 'Hot', 'Coals', 'Rory', 'Gallagher', 'was', 'definitely', 'most', 'under-rated', 'blues-rock', 'guitarist', 'time', 'DVD', 'proof', 'style', 'tone', 'are', 'blustery', 'unrefined', 'natural', 'brown-toned', 'as', 'well', 'band', 'vocal', 'guitar', 'mainly', 'strat', 'player', 'Gerry', 'McAvoy', 'bass', 'Lou', 'Martin', 'piano', 'Rod', ""de'Ath"", 'drums', 'loud', 'raw', 'blues-rock', 'heaven', 'backstage', 'interviews', 'are', 'interesting', 'too', 'show', 'how', 'electrified', 'personable', 'was', 'blatantly', 'obvious', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'playing', 'live', 'huge', 'smile', 'face', 'way', 'crowd', 'scenes', 'Belfast', 'rough', 'old', 'Irish', 'nightclubs', 'venues', 'just', 'add', 'raw', 'beauty', 'music', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'worn', 'out', 'time', ""'m"", 'done', 'watching', 'listening', 'one', 'favorite', 'DVDs']",Rory Gallagher - Irish Tour 1974
