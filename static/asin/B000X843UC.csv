North America uses the NTSC format, so you need the European player that uses the PAL format to watch them, which would pretty much preclude you needing a region-free player, since PAL players are region 2 to begin with.  You would also need a converter for your electrical outlets, as European electricity is different from ours, too.  TPTB at Amazon should specify that up there where they talk about getting a region 2 player.That being said, this show is hilarious.  Brilliant.  The cast work well together and they all are so subtle in their delivery.I love looking at the backgrounds.

I haven't been disappointed by it so far.The IT Crowd follows the three people in the IT department.

Because of that Jen has to routinely run interference between her co-workers & everyone else in the building.This show is brilliant.

1113584,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B000X843UC,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[4, 5]","Take two hopeless I.T. nerds (one a slob and one a bespectacled social misfit), and add one pathologically lying people expert.That's the setup for ""The IT Crowd,"" a fun little workplace sitcom that sits on the other end of the comedy spectrum from ""The Office"" -- in particular, hardcore farce. The first season is six episodes of pure weirdness and mild surreality, mostly focusing on desk rabbits, corporate goths, disastrous dates, too-small shoes, Aunt Irma and the occasional desk fire.As the story begins, Jen (Katherine Parkinson) is hired by the deranged CEO Dernholm, whom she has told that she knows plenty about computers. Unfortunately, he doesn't plan to have her working on the levels that are full of ""lots of sexy people, not doing much work, and having affairs.""So he sends her down to the I.T. department, a filthy basement occupied only with ""standard nerds"" -- an embittered slob named Roy (Chris O'Dowd) and socially oblivious Moss (Richard Ayoade). Despite the fact that they keep the company from imploding, nobody appreciates them (""Have you tried turning it off and on again?""). Initially the guys loathe Jen and vice versa, but gradually they start to appreciate one another.But that doesn't stop the weird plots that ensue, obviously: Roy disrupts an anti-stress seminar while Jen grapples with foot-deforming shoes (think reverse childbirth). The arrival of Jen's ""Aunt Irma"" causes the geeks to have PMS. A disastrous date causes Roy to try to prove that women love jerks, and Jen's crush on a security guard goes horribly awry when he uses her as his lifeline on ""Do You Want To Be A Millionaire?""Even stranger, the boys forbid Jen from opening The Red Door, but when Roy is trapped under a woman's desk Jen opens it and unleashes the gloomy horror within. And when Jen tries to avoid an obnoxious date, Moss ends up inadvertently spreading the rumor that she's died (while Roy tries to avoid a savage Yetilike woman).""The IT Crowd's"" first season has a few bumps in the road (""The Haunting of Bill Crouse"" way overextends some of its jokes) but is overall a pretty solid sitcom -- think a more farcical version of ""The Office"" with a dash of ""The Mighty Boosh."" It even has Noel Fielding as the supremely freaky goth that lives down in the basement like a vampire.And it's got some great running jokes like Dernholm's demented moodswingy personality (""Now stay away from me, you goblin!!"") and the idiots who call IT because their computers are unplugged. But each episode has its own running gags: toe-deforming shoes, office fires, and Jen accidentally convincing her treacherous date that she's a vengeful ghost (""Sttoopppp telling people you slept with meeeeee..."") And the dialogue is a big oozing bundle of hilarity (""I didn't even know she was pregnant...

1113597,A1WX42M589VAMQ,B000X843UC,Mir,"[10, 10]","What Reynholm Industries actually creates or produces or sells is a mystery, but what the IT department of Reynholm Industries produces is terrific comedy led by a talented trio playing Jen, Roy, and Moss (ably assisted as the show progresses by whomever is the head of Reynholm in this first season, and that's all I'll say about that). You will laugh your head off at the nerdy way of things.The players: Jen, the ""dynamic go-getter"" whose idea of lots of computer experience (a nice little fib at her job interview) is turning the computer on and off, sending and receiving email, rinse, repeat. In other words, zip qualifications to work as the manager of IT, the department exiled to the nearly windowless squalor of the basement. She gets the job all the same.The IT department's tech-savvy workers are Roy and Moss. Roy is Irish and Moss has a guffaw-inducing strictly parted afro. They're consummate nerds (look at the posters, the t-shirts, the games they play, the social awkwardness). But with Jen at the help as the ""people person"" to buffer for the non-people people that are Roy and Moss, a team gels that continues to fall into mishaps that ensure laughter.Trust me, the show is way, way better than my encapsulation. Moss is my particular fave. In series one, the episode where he has to lie is a hoot. My fave Moss-mess in this series is the fire episode. He's wonderful in his lack of practical knowledge. In later series, he just keeps getting funnier and more clueless about practical, non-IT matters.Jen, though not a nerd, is hilarious in other ways (the SHOE episode!), as well as offering an earnest ambition and likability.Roy is hot-tempered and feisty and will make you chuckle at his frustration at the computer illiteracy of others. His standard answer of ""Did you try turning it on and off?"" and ""Are you sure it's plugged in?"" will be a running gag for a few episodes, but in fresh ways.Nerds rule comedically here, and you'll love their antics. Brits manage to be goofy and funny BUT smart, too. And this is another beloved Brit-Com to add to the list. My hubby, a software engineer, likes the little in-jokes that can be found in the accessories (posters, knick-knacks, t-shirts).Each set/series has six episodes. In series one you have:Yesterday's Jam--Jen is hired as manager, and the guys want her gone on the grounds of her not knowing squat about IT. But people skills count for something, yes?Calamity Jen-- the shoes episodes. My husband and I nearly had laugh-induced strokes over the emergency number (the Brit version of 911). OMIGOSH, I won't ruin it for you, but it's dangerously funny.Fifty-Fifty--bad date/dating episode. ""Poop"" on the forehead, too.The Red Door--Roy is trapped under a desk with two female employees sitting on either side. No escape! And the wonderful Richmond (goth hilarity ensues) is discovered in the basement.The Haunting of Bill Crouse--Jen is in avoidance mode, and Moss, bad at lying, panics and tells everyone she's dead.

One might say this is how the ""Office"" might have looked like if Monty Payton were writing it while using heavily.It follows 2 socially awkward IT techs in a big corporate - Roy and Moss, and their newly appointed head of IT department, Jen. As Jen's knowledge in all matters ""computery"" does not go beyond email sending and mouse clicking, it is soon settled that she will act as the ""relationship manager"" and strive to better Roy's and Moss' social status ( lower than that of the rabid toilet cleaners) among other employees of Reynholm industries.It's certainly not just for nerds or computer savvy people - though it does have some jokes intended for that crowd. The show will tackle a bunch of intriguing topics  such as office dating, synchronized menstrual cycles, cannibalism, women shoe obsession and much much more, as well as the incredibly popular and yet so mysterious term IT- and what the hell that stands for.The first Episode or two might be a bit too weird and crazy for the novice watcher to enjoy thoroughly, but as you get the hang of it you'll be hooked, guaranteed.I've watched all 4 seasons in a heart beat, and my only complaint is that I wish there were more.

In series one, Jen (Katherine Parkinson) makes the mistake of overstating her computer skills to Denholm Reynholm (Chris Morris), the manic, slightly insane boss of Reynholm Industries.  As a reward she is sent down to manage the ""situation nerds"" in the basement -- and provide a management bridge to the corporate floors above. The team she manages -- Roy (Chris O'Dowd) and Moss (Richard Ayoade) -- are two distinctively drawn nerd types whose personalities become more endearing (and funnier) as the series progresses.  As with many Britcoms, the humor can be broad and repetitive, and frequently risque, but the cumulative effect is winning and we grow to see some of the ways the three main characters operate beyond the basement.  Especially when it comes to relationships and dating, the results are predictably disastrous and hilarious.

It involves people from two shows I love, Black Books and Look Around You and I can say if you like that type of humor, you will like the IT Crowd.  If you work in IT, you will love it more. I mean, critics say oh the ""have you turned it on and off"" line isn't funny...but have any of those people worked in IT?  Probably not.  Most computer problems can be solved by turning the computer on and off or plugging it in.The actors are so funny. Moss, Roy, Jen, the ignorant bosses and the goth guy Richmond, who is locked away in the IT's dungeon. I find it witty and original.  Whoever said the laughter is canned, it isn't. They show it being filmed in front of an audience, it's real sound.  They truly jump into their character roles without being too cliche.  The jokes come at you a mile a minute too.  Even the minor characters are great.  There is also a lot of Mighty Boosh crossovers here, namely Noel Fielding and Richard Ayoade...so fans of that would find this show worthwhile too.  It's got about the same vibe, though the IT Crowd is a lot less surreal.But what I like most in the work put into the DVD. All the graphic scenes are well done and run for a really long time. You can get a chuckle out of the graphics as well as the episodes.  The Venture Brothers used the video thing for their 3rd season, but it wasn't as well done as this, don't know which came out first, but I feel this series is a labor of love from start to finish.  The commentary is missing off the American first season (I think, unless there is some way to get to it) so the director commentary on the Season Two that keep referring to Season One, that is lost on me.  Not sure why that was not done. I think the commentary is really insightful about what the writer/director is trying to achieve and not him just going on about what he ate for breakfast or trying to be irrelevant and funny just being kooky without talking about the show, so that is a plus.",5,DVD is so funny and the DVD menus are some of the best I've even seen...,1254787200,"10 6, 2009",2009,2030,"['started', 'watching', 'friend', 'recommendation', 'IFC', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'people', 'two', 'shows', 'love', 'Black', 'Books', 'Look', 'can', 'say', 'like', 'type', 'humor', 'will', 'like', 'IT', 'Crowd', 'work', 'IT', 'will', 'love', 'more', 'mean', 'critics', 'say', 'have', 'turned', 'line', ""n't"", 'funny', 'have', 'people', 'worked', 'IT', 'Probably', 'not', 'Most', 'computer', 'problems', 'can', 'be', 'solved', 'turning', 'computer', 'plugging', 'in.The', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'funny', 'Moss', 'Roy', 'Jen', 'ignorant', 'bosses', 'goth', 'guy', 'Richmond', 'who', 'locked', 'away', 'IT', 'dungeon', 'find', 'witty', 'original', 'said', 'laughter', 'canned', ""n't"", 'show', 'being', 'filmed', 'front', 'audience', 'real', 'sound', 'truly', 'jump', 'character', 'roles', 'being', 'too', 'cliche', 'jokes', 'come', 'mile', 'minute', 'too', 'Even', 'minor', 'characters', 'are', 'great', 'also', 'lot', 'Mighty', 'Boosh', 'crossovers', 'here', 'namely', 'Noel', 'Fielding', 'Richard', 'Ayoade', 'so', 'fans', 'would', 'find', 'show', 'too', 'got', 'same', 'vibe', 'IT', 'Crowd', 'lot', 'less', 'surreal.But', 'what', 'like', 'most', 'work', 'put', 'DVD', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'run', 'really', 'long', 'time', 'can', 'get', 'chuckle', 'graphics', 'as', 'well', 'episodes', 'Venture', 'Brothers', 'used', 'video', 'thing', '3rd', 'season', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'well', 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'came', 'out', 'first', 'feel', 'series', 'labor', 'love', 'start', 'finish', 'commentary', 'missing', 'off', 'American', 'first', 'season', 'think', 'way', 'get', 'director', 'commentary', 'Season', 'Two', 'keep', 'referring', 'Season', 'One', 'lost', 'Not', 'sure', 'why', 'was', 'not', 'done', 'think', 'commentary', 'really', 'insightful', 'what', 'writer/director', 'trying', 'achieve', 'not', 'just', 'going', 'what', 'ate', 'breakfast', 'trying', 'be', 'irrelevant', 'funny', 'just', 'being', 'kooky', 'talking', 'show', 'plus']","The IT Crowd - Series 1 [Non-US Format, PAL, Region 2, Import]"
