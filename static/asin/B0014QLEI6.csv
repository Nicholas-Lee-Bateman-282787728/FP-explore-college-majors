1147243,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B0014QLEI6,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[3, 7]","I go into this review on the defensive.  Looking up some information on the movie, I peeked and saw it is not highly esteemed by professionals or amateurs.  Sporting a likable Tracy Morgan and the natural presence of Ice Cube, I found `First Sunday' to be flawed, but funny.  There's an undeniable sit-com presence in its making, and there's a whole lot of suspension of disbelief that doesn't get off the ground, yet 'First Sunday' did get me chuckling fairly often once it got going and made me a little misty eyed when they went for the message and feeling.The hijinx begins with Durell (Ice Cube) and Lee John (Tracy Morgan) two long-suffering buddies staying in trouble.  I can't say I could figure out the starting circumstances even after rewinding, but I think they're delivering drugs by transporting wheelchairs.  They aren't very good criminals.  Most criminals aren't, but they aren't all that effective, either.  Let's just say they get quickly caught and don't have the cool to slip out of the knot.  Facing court, their trial is held by a judge (Keith David) who has seen them many times before.  Perhaps out of compassion or out of disgust, he trades their time for 5,000 hours of community service.  Immediately, their outbursts indicate they aren't too grateful, but service they do.It's a hard break for Durell's estranged lady love (Regina Hall) who doesn't have enough money for her beauty salon which requires back pay.  Durell brings over forty dollars, but she announces she will have to leave and take their son (C.J. Sanders), to Atlanta where her livelihood will be more affordable.  He doesn't want to lose him, and it doesn't help that her new lover, Ralph, is built like a gym rat, so he`s determined to do something.We get a lot of random scenes on the community service circuit and in a massage parlor, but one day Durrell is inspired.  Distracted by the bottom of an attractive woman, Durell finds his way to her church.  He and Lee John join them on a Sunday, but are no closer to converting as much as following up on Durell's lustful interest in Tianna (Melinda Willams).  It is after the financial reports are read at church that they get an idea:  After hours they will come and rob the church.I won't give up the core of the bumbling adventure, but they end up being caught on a night the Deacon (Michael Keith David) checks the safe, a financial meeting takes place with the pastor (Chi McBride of `Boston Public') and Rickey, the choir director (Katt Williams) is engaged in singing practice.  The confrontation turns to a hostage situation that brings most of the movies heart and humor.It must be conceded that this movie is dumb.  However, if one considers the premise of 'Some Like It Hot,' an AFI comedy classic, where the characters escape witnessing a mob massacre by dressing in drag and going to Florida, then dumb can count.  It's how you do dumb that matters.  Don't get me wrong, by no means am I saying this is the next 'Some Like It Hot,' but I found it more entertaining than `Liar Liar,' and it exceeds the reputation of `Big Momma's House 2'.As someone who liked watching 'The Tracy Morgan Show,' a Cosby inspired sitcom, I felt that Morgan was likable, but somewhat limited here.  He was shrill, but I enjoyed Ice Cube's collected and believable performance.  The supporting cast, especially the church personnel, give natural performances, but Katt Williams steals the show as Rickey, the choir director.I can forgive 'First Sunday''s failings.  Despite the temptation to dismiss the film as just another stupid comedy adventure, `First Sunday' is forgivably funny.  It is entertaining with a moving message and a supporting cast that helps bridge the credibility gap.",3,Forgivably Funny,1210464000,"05 11, 2008",2008,3728,"['go', 'review', 'defensive', 'Looking', 'up', 'information', 'movie', 'peeked', 'saw', 'not', 'highly', 'esteemed', 'professionals', 'amateurs', 'Sporting', 'likable', 'Tracy', 'Morgan', 'natural', 'presence', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'found', 'First', 'Sunday', 'be', 'flawed', 'funny', 'undeniable', 'sit-com', 'presence', 'making', 'whole', 'lot', 'suspension', 'disbelief', ""n't"", 'get', 'off', 'ground', 'yet', ""'First"", 'Sunday', 'did', 'get', 'chuckling', 'fairly', 'often', 'got', 'going', 'made', 'little', 'misty', 'eyed', 'when', 'went', 'message', 'feeling.The', 'hijinx', 'Durell', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'Lee', 'John', 'Tracy', 'Morgan', 'two', 'long-suffering', 'buddies', 'staying', 'trouble', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'could', 'figure', 'out', 'starting', 'circumstances', 'even', 'rewinding', 'think', ""'re"", 'delivering', 'drugs', 'transporting', 'wheelchairs', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'criminals', 'Most', 'criminals', 'are', ""n't"", 'are', ""n't"", 'effective', 'either', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'get', 'quickly', 'caught', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'cool', 'slip', 'knot', 'Facing', 'court', 'trial', 'held', 'judge', 'Keith', 'David', 'who', 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'Perhaps', 'compassion', 'disgust', 'time', '5,000', 'hours', 'community', 'service', 'Immediately', 'outbursts', 'indicate', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'grateful', 'service', 'do.It', 'hard', 'break', 'Durell', 'estranged', 'lady', 'love', 'Regina', 'Hall', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'money', 'beauty', 'salon', 'back', 'pay', 'Durell', 'forty', 'dollars', 'will', 'have', 'leave', 'take', 'son', 'C.J', 'Sanders', 'Atlanta', 'where', 'livelihood', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'affordable', ""n't"", 'want', 'lose', ""n't"", 'help', 'new', 'lover', 'Ralph', 'built', 'gym', 'rat', 's', 'determined', 'do', 'something.We', 'get', 'lot', 'random', 'scenes', 'community', 'service', 'circuit', 'massage', 'parlor', 'one', 'day', 'Durrell', 'inspired', 'Distracted', 'bottom', 'attractive', 'woman', 'Durell', 'way', 'church', 'Lee', 'John', 'join', 'Sunday', 'are', 'closer', 'converting', 'as', 'much', 'following', 'up', 'Durell', 'lustful', 'interest', 'Tianna', 'Melinda', 'Willams', 'financial', 'reports', 'are', 'read', 'church', 'get', 'idea', 'hours', 'will', 'come', 'rob', 'church.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'core', 'bumbling', 'adventure', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'caught', 'night', 'Deacon', 'Michael', 'Keith', 'David', 'safe', 'financial', 'meeting', 'place', 'pastor', 'Chi', 'McBride', 'Boston', 'Public', 'Rickey', 'choir', 'director', 'Katt', 'Williams', 'engaged', 'singing', 'practice', 'confrontation', 'hostage', 'situation', 'most', 'movies', 'heart', 'humor.It', 'must', 'be', 'conceded', 'movie', 'dumb', 'However', 'one', 'premise', ""'Some"", 'Hot', 'AFI', 'comedy', 'classic', 'where', 'characters', 'escape', 'witnessing', 'mob', 'massacre', 'dressing', 'drag', 'going', 'Florida', 'then', 'dumb', 'can', 'count', 'how', 'do', 'dumb', 'matters', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'means', 'am', 'saying', 'next', ""'Some"", 'Hot', 'found', 'more', 'entertaining', 'Liar', 'Liar', 'reputation', 'Big', 'Momma', 'House', ""2'.As"", 'someone', 'who', 'liked', 'watching', ""'The"", 'Tracy', 'Morgan', 'Show', 'Cosby', 'inspired', 'sitcom', 'felt', 'Morgan', 'was', 'likable', 'somewhat', 'limited', 'here', 'was', 'shrill', 'enjoyed', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'collected', 'believable', 'performance', 'supporting', 'cast', 'especially', 'church', 'personnel', 'give', 'natural', 'performances', 'Katt', 'Williams', 'show', 'Rickey', 'choir', 'director.I', 'can', 'forgive', ""'First"", 'Sunday', 's', 'failings', 'temptation', 'dismiss', 'film', 'just', 'stupid', 'comedy', 'adventure', 'First', 'Sunday', 'forgivably', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'moving', 'message', 'supporting', 'cast', 'bridge', 'credibility', 'gap']",N/A

Ice Cube's character, Durell, was against the idea at first, but eventually agreed to do it.  In this church, they run into problems, and they learn about their mistakes and shortcomings.  I thought this movie was funny and at times sensible.  I liked Katt Williams, too.  He was very funny.I usually have a favorite character, but I have to say that they were all equally fun to watch.  But my favorite scene was when Cube and Tracy were in the church for the first time, and the choir was singing.  The choir was so awesome.

You see the problem here is that ""First Sunday"" is not even funny. I can forgive a comedy of this sort for wandering off the storyline from time to time in order to up the laughs, but Ice Cube's, ""First Sunday"", wanders off far too many times and doesn't even make up for it with any funny parts (or at least no memorable parts).Tracey Morgan and the hilarious stand-up artist, Katt Williams, do their best to try and salavge the film with one or two knee slappers but the problem is the writers. The writers don't give the actors half enough of the comedic material that they need to pull everything off. I also have quite a bit of respect for Ice Cube as an actor, and I don't blame him for this (I blame the creators), but his lead character in ""First Sunday"" is just about as bland and boring as they come. If your planning on making a film full of laughs my first suggestion is to give your main character a sense of humor. Ice Cube does not smile one time throughout the film so while all of his supporting characters are running around trying to pull some funnies, he is angrily pointing a gun at a 70 year old woman and a pastor.

I can only stand two movies that Ice Cube was in: Friday(the first one) and Higher Learning. Next Friday, Friday After Next, XXX- State Of The Union, Are We There Yet and Are We Done Yet are straight garbage. First Sunday is just as weak.Premise: Durell(Ice Cube) and Leejon(Tracy Morgan) are two crooks who decide to rob a church after Durell runs out of options. You see Durell's baby mother is planning to take his son with her to Atlanta and Durrel doesnt want that. Things go from bad to worse when they cant find the money and parishioners are coming in so Durell and Leejohn decide to take them hostage till they find the money.Opinion: The biggest problem with this movie besides the weak script is that its not funny! Every joke falls on its face with a resounding thud.  Tracey Morgan? Was he ever funny? And Katt Williams is as dry as sandpaper here. There are some touching moments in this movie: When Durell interacts with his son, when Loretta Devine's character sings happy birthday to Leejon who never had that experience and when the elder scolded Durell for what he was doing and he saw himself in the mirror. Those scenes are not bad but they still are not a good enough reason to see this movie. The movie is still as bland as an episode of Saturday Night Live and for a movie to stretch at 95 minutes its an hour and 35 minutes longer than it needs to be. Another thing, do black baby mothers have to be portrayed so negatively in these flicks? Durell's baby mother is such a raging (fill in the blank) that if she got belted nobody would feel sympathy for her. It's just a movie right? Please.
