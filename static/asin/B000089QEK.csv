736850,AGEIT17HENDIS,B000089QEK,Alfred Johnson,"[2, 3]","A number of American bourgeois political figures, usually presidential, come to epitomize the era that they live in. For example one thinks of Washington as founder of the American bourgeois republic, Jackson as the advocate of the rough-Hew democratic element that built the country and drove it westward, and Lincoln as its war time preserver and extender. The subject of this review, early 20th century President Theodore Roosevelt, readily brings to mind that period when the American republic went from being something of a backwater democratic experiment, an important one to be sure, but still outside of the main currents of world affairs to the first nibbling of its current imperial status. Needless to say that symbols of eras do not have the final say in what their era was about but certainly the life of old Teddy came as close as it could to that end.If most people were asked one thing about Teddy Roosevelt that one thing would probably be his experiences as leader of the eclectic army unit, ""The Roughriders"" , that fought in Cuba during the Spanish-American War, a war that closed out the 19th century and ushered in the new age of inter-imperial rivalries. That however, as this three plus hours production, at times painfully demonstrates, is only a small part of the personal story of the man. As usual in this type of documentary production a good number of ""talking head"" commentators, including Teddy scholars, historians of the ""robber baron"" era, surviving relatives, and other specialists give their take on the meaning of the man, his influence on history and his role in the creation of the American imperial state.And what was that role? Part One of this two part production centers on Teddy early sickly childhood, his struggle for health, and his intellectual and physical pursuits. It then moves on to his college career at Harvard, his marriages and family life and all the other sidelights that give substance to these visual biographies. The key though, given his patrician class background, is his magnet-like attachment to the political rough and tumble, first in local New York Republican state politics and then later as campaigner and official in various national Republican administrations in the late 19th century. This segment finishes up with Roosevelt's above-mentioned war adventure in Cuba that he did so much to encourage, his time as New York Governor, as accidental American Vice President and equally accidental President after McKinley's assassination.Part two centers on his presidency which included his fight against the trusts, his fight to save the Western lands for the future, his role in international diplomacy, his creation of a strong navy that he had started earlier in his career as a Navy Department official, and his acknowledged indifference, although not hostility, to the fate of black people in this country at a time when ""Jim Crow"" was gripping the South (and got reflected by &lt;em>de facto&lt;/em> segregation in the North as well). The remainder of the documentary details his post-presidential years including his run as the ""Bull Moose"" candidate in 1912, his support to Wilson's war efforts and his last years away from the center of attention. All in all well done, with many good photographs and film clips from the period plus a spirited Teddy narration by actor Richard Dreyfuss. For the Teddy aficionado probably not enough but for the novice a very good primer of what it was like to stand at the head of the American Republic at the dawn of the imperium.",5,At The Dawn Of The American Imperium,1271894400,"04 22, 2010",2010,3544,"['number', 'American', 'bourgeois', 'political', 'figures', 'usually', 'presidential', 'come', 'epitomize', 'era', 'live', 'example', 'one', 'Washington', 'founder', 'American', 'bourgeois', 'republic', 'Jackson', 'advocate', 'rough-Hew', 'democratic', 'element', 'built', 'country', 'drove', 'westward', 'Lincoln', 'war', 'time', 'preserver', 'extender', 'subject', 'review', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'President', 'Theodore', 'Roosevelt', 'readily', 'mind', 'period', 'when', 'American', 'republic', 'went', 'being', 'something', 'backwater', 'democratic', 'experiment', 'important', 'one', 'be', 'sure', 'still', 'main', 'currents', 'world', 'affairs', 'first', 'nibbling', 'current', 'imperial', 'status', 'Needless', 'say', 'symbols', 'eras', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'final', 'say', 'what', 'era', 'was', 'certainly', 'life', 'old', 'Teddy', 'came', 'as', 'close', 'could', 'most', 'people', 'were', 'asked', 'one', 'thing', 'Teddy', 'Roosevelt', 'one', 'thing', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'experiences', 'leader', 'eclectic', 'army', 'unit', 'Roughriders', 'fought', 'Cuba', 'Spanish-American', 'War', 'war', 'closed', '19th', 'century', 'ushered', 'new', 'age', 'inter-imperial', 'rivalries', 'however', 'three', 'hours', 'production', 'times', 'painfully', 'only', 'small', 'part', 'personal', 'story', 'man', 'usual', 'type', 'documentary', 'production', 'good', 'number', 'talking', 'head', 'commentators', 'including', 'Teddy', 'scholars', 'historians', 'robber', 'baron', 'era', 'surviving', 'relatives', 'other', 'specialists', 'give', 'take', 'meaning', 'man', 'influence', 'history', 'role', 'creation', 'American', 'imperial', 'state.And', 'what', 'was', 'role', 'Part', 'One', 'two', 'part', 'production', 'centers', 'Teddy', 'early', 'sickly', 'childhood', 'struggle', 'health', 'intellectual', 'physical', 'pursuits', 'then', 'college', 'career', 'Harvard', 'marriages', 'family', 'life', 'other', 'sidelights', 'give', 'substance', 'visual', 'biographies', 'key', 'given', 'patrician', 'class', 'background', 'magnet-like', 'attachment', 'political', 'rough', 'tumble', 'first', 'local', 'New', 'York', 'Republican', 'state', 'politics', 'then', 'later', 'campaigner', 'official', 'various', 'national', 'Republican', 'administrations', 'late', '19th', 'century', 'segment', 'up', 'Roosevelt', 'above-mentioned', 'war', 'adventure', 'Cuba', 'did', 'so', 'much', 'encourage', 'time', 'New', 'York', 'Governor', 'accidental', 'American', 'Vice', 'President', 'equally', 'accidental', 'President', 'McKinley', 'assassination.Part', 'two', 'centers', 'presidency', 'included', 'fight', 'trusts', 'fight', 'save', 'Western', 'lands', 'future', 'role', 'international', 'diplomacy', 'creation', 'strong', 'navy', 'had', 'started', 'earlier', 'career', 'Navy', 'Department', 'official', 'acknowledged', 'indifference', 'not', 'hostility', 'fate', 'black', 'people', 'country', 'time', 'when', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'was', 'gripping', 'South', 'got', 'reflected', 'lt', '>', 'de', 'facto', 'lt', '>', 'segregation', 'North', 'as', 'well', 'remainder', 'documentary', 'details', 'post-presidential', 'years', 'including', 'run', 'Bull', 'Moose', 'candidate', '1912', 'support', 'Wilson', 'war', 'efforts', 'last', 'years', 'away', 'center', 'attention', 'well', 'done', 'many', 'good', 'photographs', 'film', 'clips', 'period', 'spirited', 'Teddy', 'narration', 'actor', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'Teddy', 'aficionado', 'probably', 'not', 'enough', 'novice', 'very', 'good', 'primer', 'what', 'was', 'stand', 'head', 'American', 'Republic', 'dawn', 'imperium']",N/A

Yet icon he is, for he stands for everything the ideal American should: Ambition, the drive to do what it takes to accomplish your dreams, the courage to stand up to the bully (in his case, big business) who no one else will stand up to.  Call him what you will, Roosevelt was an incredible man.This documentary is beautifully done.  Richard Dreyfuss is perfect as the voice of Teddy--I couldn't imagine a better match.  Clips of video, photographs, and splendid views of gorgeous scenery make this documentary pleasing to the eye, and superb editing and dubbing, coupled with relevant commentary and quotes from Teddy himself make it enjoyable to listen to as well.  These features combine to make Teddy a REAL person, with insecurities and fears to match his ambitions and acheivements, and serve to endear him to almost any viewer.I have studied almost nothing on Theodore Roosevelt, so I can't really comment on how accurate this is.  It is possible (it wouldn't be the first time) that the History Channel is a little hazy on some of the facts, but for all I know this film is accurate.

His legacy is still with us: Whenever you put a burger on the grill and don't die from it...thank TR. Whenever you turn on your faucet to drink water that's not infected...thank TR. Whenever you visit Grand Canyon and enjoy its beauty...thank TR.The only complaint I have about this DVD is it doesn't go into full details about TR's Civil Rights record. TR wasn't perfect, but he was MUCH better than most presidents and had a very close relationship with two black men that worked for his family.In polls, TR is ranked in the top 5 (Lincoln, FDR, and Washington are ranked higher) as our greatest presidents.

I decided to get it precisely because I didn't know much about him and didn't want to start with a dense tome.  TR was a man of ambition, of energy, of strongly held views, a man who had many great successes and tragedies in his life.

I got the sense while watching this that I understood the man.  There is some discussion of his policies, and his role in the great events of the day, but this DVD about the man, not politics or policy.  You'll learn about TR's family life, the ups and downs along his way to the presidency, his successes and failures as president.
