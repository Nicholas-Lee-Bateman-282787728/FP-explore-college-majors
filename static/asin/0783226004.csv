55173,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,0783226004,Acute Observer,"[0, 1]","The film begins on a snowy night. Hackers broke into a computer to issue checks to various groups. One leaves to buy food, the others are caught by the police. [Was such hacking possible in 1969?] Later we see a group who are tapping into phone lines. An alarm goes off because of a device in a safety deposit box. This is all part of a burglary that tests security for a bank: its perfectly legal. Two businessmen arrive at Martin Bishop's company to hire him for a special job. They'll do it for the money. They start to surveil the subject, a professor who may have a formula to create unbreakable codes. Others are interested in that professor's work. ""Social engineering"" is used to gain admittance to the target corporation. [The slow response to questions tells of the prompting.] Does Bishop talk too much at that party? ""Too many secrets?""Can one device the size of a cassette telephone answering machine allow unauthorized access to secured sites? [Only in a Hollywood film.] Does possession of this device put them in grave danger? ""Who were those guys?"" Now the mystery begins. Should Martin disappear again? Could a private business have great need for that device? Can official records be changed to create evidence? Who can you trust? The team plans to break into the corporation to retrieve that device. Is it an impossible mission? The film makes it seem plausible. Will there be any problems to hype the drama? Will the good guys win against the odds? The usual formula says they will, with plenty of action at the finish. Does the deus ex machina ending detract from the story?Does the idea of organized crime owning an electronics company seem far out? Do legitimate companies build trapdoors into their software to allow clandestine access to their customer's data?

It's not that organizedSneakers has an unabashed leftist slant, but in spite of that it is a pretty good high tech espionage thriller. Robert Redford plays Martin Brice, alias Martin Bishop. A Hacker since the 60's, he got away because he went out for pizza, while his partner, Cosmo went to prison. Years later Martin is still underground but he makes his living robbing banks using high tech schemes and subterfuge. The difference is that now he is employed by the banks themselves to expose weaknesses in their security. When he is approached by the NSA he at first refuses, as he doesn't work for the government, but when the choice is between working for them and getting his record expunged or going to prison, he accepts.--------------------Martin Bishop: You know I could have been in the NSA, but they found out my parents were married.==============================The job is to get a black box made by a mathematician that contains an algorithm capable of cracking any code.Martin leads a rag tag group of operatives with various specialties. Whistler (David Strathairn) is a phone phreak modeled after a real life phone phreak, also blind, with perfect pitch, who was able to control phone switches by whistling the codes (on a side note, another phone phreak was known as Captain Crunch because he discovered that a whistle from a box of cereal could also switch phones). Donald Crease (Sidney Poitier) is a former CIA man who had to quit because of his temper. Mother (Dan Aykroyd) is the resident conspiracy theorist. He is always getting under Crease's skin spouting his crazy theories about cattle mutilations or the JFK Assassination Conspiracy, the mother of all conspiracies.-----------Crease: Now what are you saying, the NSA killed Kennedy?Mother: No, they shot him but they didn't kill him. He's still alive.=====================Carl (River Phoenix) is the precocious rep for the younger generation of hackers.Together, they get the black box, but at the hand off they figure out that the NSA agents are not who they claim to be. Cosmo (Ben Kingsley), Martin's old friend, is behind it. He has gone over to the dark side. He wants to use the box to bring down the whole financial system, causing global chaos -- not unlike the situation we find ourselves in at present. The second act involves getting the box back from the bad guys, who will stop at nothing to prevent them.----------Cosmo: I'm sorry if he hurt you. I'm afraid Wallace doesn't like you very much.Martin Bishop: You oughta have that guy checked for rabies.Cosmo: Rabies occurs only in warm-blooded animals.===============Call it Mission Improbable, but apart from the universal code cracking box most of the technology is pretty accurate and cleverly implemented. The tone hovers between light comedy and high tech espionage thriller, but with a cast as charming as this, that is an easy caper for them to pull off.Robert Redford, River Phoenix, Sidney Poitier, Ben Kingsley, David Strathairn... what a stellar cast. Check out River Phoenix in Running on Empty, or Strathairn in Good Night, and Good Luck. The politics are half baked, and there is wishful thinking involved, but Sneakers makes a good case that the good guys will prevail because they are smarter, and that is a good antidote for the paranoia that movies like Oliver Stone's JFK inspire, where some rough beast, its hour come round at last, slouches towards Bethlehem to be born.------------------------Dr. Gunter Janek: It would be a breakthrough of Gaussian proportions and allow us to acquire the solution in a dramatically more efficient manner.=====================================Good Night, and Good Luck (Widescreen Edition)(2005) ....

Also appearing is David Strathairn (Dolores Claiborne), Dan Aykroyd (Grosse Pointe Blank), the late River Phoenix (My Own Private Idaho), Mary McDonnell (Independence Day), and Ben Kingsley (Gandhi).In the film, Martin Bishop (Redford) and his colleagues operate a security company who other businesses hire to break into their companies, exposing where their security may be lacking.  Each member of the small team has their own, unique background (many involving past criminal activities), but after the group is approached (blackmailed) by a gooberment agency with a proposition to recover a mysterious device (it involves the use of computers and cryptography), it's discovered that Bishop has the most to lose if they don't accept the job.  The group manages the acquisition easy enough, but soon find themselves in a heap of trouble as the device turns out to be something of extreme value, a device many would kill to possess.  As the web of conspiracy and deceit grows, as does the level of danger (various individuals wind up getting killed), the group must use all their abilities to outwit those intent on stealing the device for themselves, using it for their own, nefarious purposes, and seeing Martin and his co-workers in jail, or even dead.Sneakers is a deceptive film.  I've seen it a few times, the first time I saw it, it appeared to be a light movie (I've read that the makers of the film injected a modest amount of profanity into the script to avoid a `G' rating, for fears the movie would have been perceived as a film for children) with a few, gaping plot holes, but subsequent viewings (for me, at least), reveal it to be a very rich, complex, intelligent, enjoyable thriller with an excellent cast and a tight storyline with little or no mistakes, and the plot holes I originally perceived actually dealt with, many times in very subtle ways, hence the need for repeat viewings (it's important to pay attention to many of the little details provided throughout).  Redford and Poitier are the strongest cast members in the film, but they don't necessarily come off that way, as they seem to understand the importance of their parts within the whole of the film, instilling a subtleness within their performances, allowing for the focus to be on the story rather on themselves.  This seems to be an obvious sign of their experience, and I found myself appreciating this, as often starring actors tend to be full of themselves, and their efforts on screen show it...originally it seemed to me that the character development was a bit light, but I've since come to feel we're given just exactly what's needed for the story, and anymore would have bordered on the extraneous and unnecessary.  Also, it's nice to see a film where Dan Aykroyd plays a relatively minor part, doing what he's told, having nothing to do with the writing or directing (he not only wrote but directed the one of the worst films I've ever seen in 1991's Nothing But Trouble).  Also, I usually tend to like women with the longer hair, but I thought Mary McDonnell, with her short hair and all, looked very attractive and added a wonderful, feminine element to this nearly all male cast with her role as Liz, a former lover of Bishop, now assisting the group seemingly out of appreciation of Bishop's past.  Director Robinson keeps the pacing tight, and uses the talent within the film well (I supposed this is helped by the fact he also wrote the screenplay, so he has an intimate understanding of the visuals he wants to present in accordance with the story).  The McGuffin (a term invented by Alfred Hitchcock to describe the element of the film the plot centers on...he would often present, but rarely elaborate on it, as its' specifics were never important, in his mind, only its' use in providing focus for the story and progressing the plot) seems a bit farfetched, but the smart story and the talented performances do well in creating a level of believability that got through this aspect.  Another important feature of the film is the musical score, provided by legendary and prolific composer James Horner (Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan, Aliens).  Usually I neglect mentioning the music within a film unless it's either really bad or really good (the latter being the case here).  I wonder how many people are aware that he started out composing for low budget producer Roger Corman, working on films like Battle Beyond the Stars and Humanoids From the Deep, both released 1980. A couple of minor appearances worth looking for are Donal Logue (Blade, The Tao of Steve), James Earl Jones (Clear and Present Danger), and Timothy Busfield (Revenge of the Nerds).  Favorite line from the film?  When Bishop is talking to the NSA guys and responds, ""I could have been in the NSA, but they found out my parents were married.""The widescreen anamorphic picture (1.85:1) looks reasonably fair, and the Dolby Digital Surround 2.0 tracks (available in English, French, and Spanish) sound decent.  Special features include an original theatrical trailer for the film, subtitles, informative production notes, background and filmographies of some of the cast and crew, a `making of' featurette, and commentary track by the director.  All in all a decent release of a really good film.Cookieman108",4,"""Cattle mutilations are up.""",1105315200,"01 10, 2005",2005,5905,"['first', 'time', 'used', 'credit', 'card', 'buy', 'something',

55189,A2OSERGXBYMPJ0,0783226004,C. T. Mikesell,"[5, 5]","This film is an example of what an ensemble cast of A-list actors can do when they have fun with a project. While their acting has been better in other films, their camaraderie carries the film. Clocking in at over 2 hours, the film becomes muddled in parts, but your interest in the characters keeps you from becoming overly impatient with it. Equal parts ""Charade"" and ""WarGames"" the movie keeps you guessing at who's who and what the character's true motivations are, while the technology doesn't get out of hand (most solutions are low- not high-tech).For a Collector's Edition, the supplementary material on the DVD is disappointing. The high point is the commentary: the detailed reminiscences of the director and writers are informative and enjoyable. The ""Making of"" documentary is pleasant, but doesn't build much on the commentary; the comments of the cast don't expand beyond telling who the characters are (only Ackroyd describes anything he brought to his character beyond the writers' amalgam of 70s and 80s phone phreaks and social engineers). The single theatrical preview is nice, but with along with the bonus materials in general, you feel there should have been more. The only other item on the Bonus Materials section is a ""Recommendation"" for ""other films you might enjoy"": Field of Dreams (same director/writer), Spy Game (also with Redford), and The Sting (Redford again, with James Earl Jones' father); there aren't previews of these films, just three small DVD cases sharing the screen. No deleted scenes (although several are described in the commentary). No outtakes (you know there had to be some serious hijinks on the set). No scripts or scene comparisons to show the film's decade-long evolution. Not even an Easter egg to reward devoted hackers.Buy this disc for the movie, not the bonus materials.

55191,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,0783226004,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[11, 13]","The movie SNEAKERS owes a great deal to the television show MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. In fact the movie, which follows an eclectic group of colorful characters pulling off some amazing missions, is something of a hybrid mix of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, WARGAMES and James Bond with a splash of ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN thrown in for good measure.Perhaps its only a coincidence then that the movie's star, Robert Redford was also the star of the 1970s story which detailed the shady underbelly of the federal government and the investigative work following the Watergate break-ins. And the parallels with WARGAMES are even more obvious since its writers (Lawrence Lasker and Walter F, Parkes) were also responsible for this effort.Regardless, SNEAKERS gives is an exciting and fun, yes fun, look at the power of computers in today's age and what a danger that the technology can do in the wrong hands. The movie opens in the Dec. 1969 with two college kids hacking into Richard Nixon's bank account, one of them goes out to grab some Chinese and as he is getting into his vehicle sees his friend being arrested.Fast forward two decades and we learn that the college hacker who had avoided the rap earlier has assumed a new identity and now goes under the title of Martin Bishop. He has joined a group that specialize in testing banks security systems and other such missions. Among the group is Sydney Poitier as former straight-laced CIA operative Donald Creese, Dan Aykroyd as the conspiracy-theory obsessed ""Mother,"" River Phoenix as the young hotshot ""romantic"" Carl Arbegast and David Stratham as the blind  Erwin ""Whistler"" Emory.The group is contracted to get their hands on a chip that would allow computer users to hack into any network, something both the government's NSA and the criminal underworld want to get their hands on (so that the former cannot break into the latter's networks. Involved in this complex, but entertaining plot is Bishop's former friend Cosmo (Ben Kingsley) who went to work for the underworld after getting out of prison. The dramatic scenes between Redford and Kingsley are some of the best exchanges in the movie. In addition the exchanges between ""Mother"" and Creese provide for some humor as the former irritates the latter constantly with his ever more involved conspiracies. The dialogue really shines and the movie is easy to recommend.The collector's edition may appear a little thin on special features today when 2-disc ultimate editions have become the norm, but it does serve up an interesting 39-minute ""Making of..."" documentary and a breezy, friendly scene specific commentary track.The featurette includes a number of archival on-camera interviews with the stars including Robert Redford, Ben Kingsley, Dab Aykroyd and the late River Phoenix. It is among these interviews that we learn that the slides projected onto the wall behind the professor as he teaches cryptography theory were actually prepared by a real professor of cryptography. And that Aykroyd based his conspiracy theorist character on his brother (who apparently believes all number of conspiracies including that there has never been a picture taken of the North Pole.)Understandably the three recount how stars flocked to their movie once Redford had signed on.We also learn that the blind Whistler was based on a real-life blind sneaker who was imprisoned after creating a box that could replicate telephones touch-tones.Director/Writer Phil Alden Robinson recounts the genesis of the story and how co-writers Lasker and Parkes came across the term ""sneakers"" while they were writing WARGAMES in 1981. Initially the term was a reference to the young programmers at IBM who come to work wearing sneakers. However, they learned at a computer convention in Chicago that the term also referred to groups who are hired to break into secure networks. Believing this to be a great basis for a movie the two (along with Robinson) began a 10-year journey (during which they managed to bring a dozen other movies to the screen) to put together the story. Initially the younger Redford and Kingsley characters were to have been responsible for a campus explosion but this was changed to hacking into Nixons account because the audience would have never gained sympathy for the Redford character in the original screenplay.The three (Robinson, Parkes and Lasker) are obviously great friends as is evidenced by the scene-specific commentary. They talk about the characterization and there is good balance between technical and anecdotal remembrances. They recount how they received some erroneous criticism from Ebert who said they used up-to-the-date technology in the 1969 opener when in fact they went out of their way to use 1969-era computers as well as the producers search for a young looking Redford.Trailers and recommendations round out the special features.",5,DVD edition includes nice extras on WARGAMES meets MISSION IMPOSSIBLE

55200,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,0783226004,Erik North,"[6, 6]","Robert Redford and Sidney Poitier head a fine cast in SNEAKERS, a solid 1992 thriller with a robust sense of humor directed and co-written with good skill by Phil Alden Robinson (FIELD OF DREAMS).  In it, Redford, who has been on the run since 1969 for computer hacking in that politically turbulent time, heads up a team of security experts known as ""sneakers"", whose job it is to penetrate the security set-ups of their respective clients to give them tips whenever those companies' security systems are lacking.  Then two guys (Timothy Busfield; Eddie Jones) claiming to be from the National Security Agency give Redford the biggest task of all: to recover a ""little black box"" from a Czech scientist visiting in the San Francisco Bay Area.But when they find out what this little black box does, they realize that they could be marked for death.  For this box is actually a machine that can break any security codes to every single system on the planet.  And when Busfield and Jones turn out NOT to be NSA representatives and renege on the arrangement they made with him, Redford is forced to confront an old friend (Ben Kingsley) from his past who is now out to take revenge.Structured with elements of techno-thrillers, spy thrillers, and fears of Big Brother, and combined with goodly amounts of humor, SNEAKERS moves quite briskly through its 125-minute running time.  Suspenseful moments, including Redford having to move ultra-slowly through a highly secured area to recover the box in Kingsley's complex, are juxtaposed with moments of political humor, including Dan Aykroyd's conspiracy-obsessed technician, and in the film's introductory scene, in which the younger versions of Redford and Kingsley think of transfering the money in Richard Nixon's personal checking account to the National Association to Legalize Marijuana.  As rightly mentioned in Amazon's review of the film, that little black box that can break every code functions as what Hitchcock calls a ""McGuffin"", a plot device that may not mean much to us until we realize why people want it so badly they'd kill for it.  This, combined with fears of the government functioning as ""Big Brother"", make SNEAKERS every bit as relevant today as when it was released in 1992, perhaps even more so.",5,"""Sneaking"" Around",1103241600,"12 17, 2004",2004,2267,"['Robert', 'Redford', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'head', 'fine', 'cast', 'SNEAKERS', 'solid', '1992', 'thriller', 'robust', 'sense', 'humor', 'directed', 'co-written', 'good', 'skill', 'Phil', 'Alden', 'Robinson', 'FIELD', 'OF', 'DREAMS', 'Redford', 'who', 'been', 'run', '1969', 'computer', 'hacking', 'politically', 'turbulent', 'time', 'up', 'team', 'security', 'experts', 'known', 'sneakers', 'job', 'penetrate', 'security', 'set-ups', 'respective', 'clients', 'give', 'tips', 'whenever', 'companies', 'security', 'systems', 'are', 'lacking', 'Then', 'two', 'guys', 'Timothy', 'Busfield', 'Eddie', 'Jones', 'claiming', 'be', 'National', 'Security', 'Agency', 'give', 'Redford', 'biggest', 'task', 'recover', 'little', 'black', 'box', 'Czech', 'scientist', 'visiting', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Bay', 'Area.But', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'little', 'black', 'box', 'realize', 'could', 'be', 'marked', 'death', 'box', 'actually', 'machine', 'can', 'break', 'security', 'codes', 'single', 'system', 'planet', 'when', 'Busfield', 'Jones', 'turn', 'out', 'NOT', 'be', 'NSA', 'representatives', 'renege', 'arrangement', 'made', 'Redford', 'forced', 'confront', 'old', 'friend', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'past', 'who', 'now', 'take', 'revenge.Structured', 'elements', 'techno-thrillers', 'spy', 'thrillers', 'fears', 'Big', 'Brother', 'combined', 'goodly', 'amounts', 'humor', 'SNEAKERS', 'quite', 'briskly', '125-minute', 'running', 'time', 'Suspenseful', 'moments', 'including', 'Redford', 'having', 'move', 'ultra-slowly', 'highly', 'secured', 'area', 'recover', 'box', 'Kingsley', 'complex', 'are', 'juxtaposed', 'moments', 'political', 'humor', 'including', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'conspiracy-obsessed', 'technician', 'film', 'introductory', 'scene', 'younger', 'versions', 'Redford', 'Kingsley', 'think', 'transfering', 'money', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'personal', 'checking', 'account', 'National', 'Association', 'Legalize', 'Marijuana', 'rightly', 'mentioned', 'Amazon', 'review', 'film', 'little', 'black', 'box', 'can', 'break', 'code', 'functions', 'what', 'Hitchcock', 'McGuffin', 'plot', 'device', 'may', 'not', 'mean', 'much', 'realize', 'why', 'people', 'want', 'so', 'badly', ""'d"", 'kill', 'combined', 'fears', 'government', 'functioning', 'Big', 'Brother', 'make', 'SNEAKERS', 'bit', 'relevant', 'today', 'when', 'was', 'released', '1992', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'so']",N/A

The personalities are well rounded for such a movie, and though a bit caricatured, all of them are respectfully portrayed. The manner in which they work with one another is entertaining to watch, though there are no surprises on the inter-relational level.The concept is as plausible as can be expected for a thriller of this type, and as long as that is accepted, a good time will be had. If you feel like dissecting the actual technological side of things too much annoyances will occur, but reality would be less cinematic, so it's best just to let it slide. (If you happen to have that decryption device be sure to let me know as soon as possible!)I really can't call it a suspenseful thriller, since the good guys are too obviously good and the bad guys too obviously bad to cast any doubt on the outcome. The suspense-setpieces are entertaining to watch, and the ways in which they infiltrate the places they need to be is pure funstuff.The villain is a bit deranged and his motivations/employers remain something of a mystery. Which i find rather annoying. He becomes too delusional and ignorant to seem like much of a threat. The organization to which he belongs remains completely invisible so that the movie can focus on the personal relationship between Redford and Kingsley.

First of all, to call this movie a thriller is an insult to the genre, and it is a misnomer. The only way to enjoy this movie, if is it is possible at all, is to call it what it is: a comedy. It really is a comedy. But the problem is that it is even a bad one at that. This movie starts out as a thriller, so we don't know it is a comedy, until half an hour or so into it. When you first see the comedy scenes, you think it is a flaw, but keep on watching. But after an hour or so, it totally degenerates. And at the end, the writer or the director must have decided that it is not possible to pull this together anyway, so why not make it a complete comedy? The finale gives the impression that they wanted the movie to be a satire may be, but it is too late for that. I mean it is not possible to make anything of this movie. It is not possible to say it has a plausible or consistent plot. There are gaping holes in the plot. And then it is too serious at times to be a comedy. I would nonetheless put it in that genre. If you want a good thriller, there are very good ones out there, don't waste your time with this. If you want satire on government, or conspiracy theories, don't waste your time with this either.

Written and directed by FIELD OF DREAMS Phil Alden Robinson, this movie charms with its array of colorful characters and the cast's obvious understanding of what they were intended to do.  A then middle-aged Robert Redford, still maintaining that boyish handsomeness, has a field day as Martin Bishop, a man who has been on the run since avoiding capture in an earlier computer hacking scam.  His crew of ""sneakers"" includes Sidney Poitier, Dan Aykroyd, River Phoenix and the marvelous David Strathairn.  Mary McDonnell from DANCES WITH WOLVES is also along for the ride, and she is a joyful addition to the cast.  Ben Kingsley shows up as the real villain, and we even get THIRTY SOMETHINGS Timothy Busfield as one of the villains.  The ubiquitous James Earl Jones shows up for the climax which is hilarious as each team member tells him what they want from him before they give him the valued box.

55238,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,0783226004,mirasreviews,"[0, 0]","""Sneakers"" was brought to us in 1992 by the folks who wrote ""WarGames"" in 1983 and is probably the second important hacker film, a subgenre that was sparsely populated back then. ""Sneakers"" are a team of black hat-ish hackers and security experts who hire out their services to companies who want to test their security systems. Marty Bishop (Robert Redford), a first-generation hacker who got up to mischief in the 1960s and had to flee to Canada, owns the operation, and, one day, two men claming to be NSA agents insist on hiring him. He is to retrieve a device from a crypto mathematician named Gunter Janek (Donal Logue) in exchange for $175,000, to keep decryption technology from falling into Russian hands. After consulting with his team, Marty reluctantly takes the job, only to find the situation more complicated and the technology more powerful than he expected.""Sneakers"" was in development for 9 years. Walter F. Parkes and Lawrence Lasker, who co-wrote ""WarGames"", conceived of the film as a result of research they did on that film. Phil Alden Robinson ended up finishing the script and directing the film, while Lasker produced. This is a high-concept, relevant story, so it's difficult to imagine why it took so long to get the film off the ground. But once it was, it seems that everyone was eager to participate. It's an all-star cast, with Sidney Poitier playing second to Redford as ex-CIA agent Donald Crease. Dan Ackroyd is the team's conspiracy-spouting technician. Ben Kingsley is Marty's old hacking buddy Cosmo. David Straithairn is the team's blind phone phreak ""Whistler"". River Phoenix plays the team's young apprentice Carl, the only GenXer among Baby Boomers. He seems hazy, presumably due to his drug problem.Parkes and Lasker tried to cram every interesting tidbit that they discovered about phone phreaks, the security industry, and cryptography into these characters. And they question who controls information and who has access in the Digital Age. This is admirable, but it is sometimes an awkward fit. Occasionally they resort to just having characters mouth the themes, such as: ""The world isn't run by weapons anymore, or energy, or money. It's run by little ones and zeros. Little bits of data. It's all just electrons."" And ""there's a war out there, old friend. A world war. And it's not about who's got the most bullets. It's about who controls the information...It's all about the information!"" They sound like cypherpunks -a year before the Clipper Chip was announced. We would have to wait 20 years for domestic surveillance by the NSA, but ""Sneakers"" was prescient there.Weaving complex themes and iconic digital underground types into a formulaic caper plot can produce a hokey effect. The characters are a little thin. Mary McDonnell, as Marty's ex-girlfriend Liz, seems thrown in there just to have a woman in the cast. The capers are not as suspenseful as one might hope. But I commend the filmmakers for their efforts to make their real-world inspirations authentic on screen. The prison experiences of famed phone phreak John Draper, AKA Captain Crunch, were the inspiration for the Cosmo character. Robinson consulted Ricky Jay about a slight of hand trick in the first scene. He went so far as to hire cryptographer Len Aldeman of RSA fame to write Janek's lecture and his slides. Wrap it up in a classic caper plot, throw in some humor, a great cast, and you've got a fun, provocative movie that ages well thematically, if not technologically.The DVD (Universal Collector's Edition 2004): ""The Making of Sneakers"" (40 min) interviews writer/director Phil Alden Robinson, writer Walter F. Parkes, and writer/producer Lawrence Lasker about the film's conception and long development, the writing process, characters, and where their inspirations came from. There are also brief interviews with John Draper, Len Aldeman, and the cast. There is an audio commentary by Robinson, Parkes, and Lasker as well. They discuss the multiple functions served by each scene due to so much plot, characters, plot, some camerawork, and make comparisons to early drafts of the script. The focus is on the writing. There is a theatrical trailer (2  min). Subtitles are available for the film in Spanish and French. Captioning available in English.

55239,A3UVGHUDOY77YR,0783226004,MissPammy,"[0, 0]","""Sneakers"" is one of my favorite watch-again movies, and I think it has the elements needed to become a classic: numerous stars; a tight, suspenseful plot; enough laugh-out-loud humor to make it lots of fun to watch; and plenty of action and intrigue.  The star-studded cast includs Robert Redford, Dan Aykroyd, Ben Kingsley, Mary McDonnell, the late River Phoenix, Sidney Poitier, James Earl Jones, and David Strathairn, and each of them brings an excellent performance.  This quirky combination of stars plays well in the movie, with Aykroyd channeling his brother, who believes every conspiracy theory ever devised and Redford as the guy who gets all the dangerous tasks, or--as Poitier puts it--""all the fun stuff.""  Ben Kingsley as the maniacal Cosmo with his two cold-blooded operatives, Timothy Busfield and Eddie Jones, is just scary enough to keep you on the edge of your seat, while the other performers all add humor to the suspense.  Stephen Tobolowsky as Dr. Werner Brandes is comical as Mary McDonnell's computer date, yet menacing when he finds out her true identity.  This is an engaging and entertaining movie that lets the viewer into the inner sanctum of a group of exceptionally talented computer gurus with the boyish charm of high school geeks.  It has a warmth and vibrancy that are a bit unexpected for a movie of its genre, and there are few ""slow"" moments in the film; the action keeps moving.  The scene where Robert Redford unexpectedly encounters the mathematician's paramour is hilarious, and the one where Whistler drives the van is hair-raising and funny at the same time.  It's fun to watch for details such as Redford's using a Popeil Pocket Fisherman to retrieve something, right in the midst of a suspenseful moment.

His supporting cast shows  what a broad range of talent is necessary  to handle the roles imposed by  dealing with security issues.  Each is a social malcontent, yet  wholly  professional as they address the questions posed by clients and  circumstances.  Among them, David Strathairn stands out.  Comparing his  presentation with his base  commander role in Memphis Belle shows the depth  of his abilities.  As a blind techie relying  on hearing alone, his  contribution to this film is sensational.  The only predictable figure is  Dan Akroyd - he seems to come straight from a Ghostbusters take without  shedding any of  that character.

The technology is valid, a 'super cracker' device is  under investigation by countless agencies,  both government and private.  Today's mathematics will provide such a device, but one  hopes it won't be  achieved by the strange character depicted in this film.  The serious  question arises over who will control it.  James Earl Jones, as the  government agent who ultimately acquires the cracker is far too easygoing  for the job he fills.That being said, the message of this film is  vivvidly expressed.

In his eyes, what he and Robert Redford's ""Martin"" were doing in college -- shifting money from ""The Man"" to charities via hacking -- was a real exercise in altruism; for Martin, it was just a prank.  Although Cosmo is technically the villain of the piece, he is not evil (just off his rocker); he doesn't want to use the MacGuffin to gain power, but to carry out a demented, massive-scale version of the same wealth redistribution he and Martin were doing in college.  He's a genuinely tragic character, and Kingsley's portrayal of him was very powerful, yet he avoided scenery chewing (and that line about the future being about who controls the information was terrifyingly prescient).  I also thought that ""Liz,"" Martin's on-again, off-again, was a charming, elegant, intelligent, welcome departure from the bimbos so popular during this period.

55274,A243HY69GIAHFI,0783226004,tropic_of_criticism,"[34, 37]","SNEAKERS is one of those movies that didn't have a great box office run despite being a fantastic film. It fortunately has found a second life in the video market, maintaining a respectable, though not stellar, presence  on best-seller lists.  Why does it continue to convert audiences a decade  after release?  Because it's everything we expect of a fun summer movie,  but don't usually get.You know that feeling you have the day before a  summer blockbuster is going to be released?  That one of total anticipation  that tells you this movie is going to be the best thing you've ever seen?  And then you go to the movie and it totally disappoints you because the  characters were made of cardboard.  the action scenes were implausible, and  the romance was just set decoration?SNEAKERS is not that film.  SNEAKERS  entirely satisfies.  In fact, SNEAKERS is, in my estimation, the very best  (fictional) action film of the 1990s.At the heart of the film is a  very clever, character-based script.  It combines tried and true Grecian  tragedy with thoroughly modern humor, cool gadgets, and genuine intrigue.  The relationships between Redford and McDonnell-like the friendship between  Redford and Kingsley--is mature and complex, bringing true character  development in its wake.All of it is made possible by phenomenal acting.  No one (except maybe James Earl Jones) is playing to type.  Redford is  very much a reluctant hero, less than confident in his abilities, and  having romantic difficulties with the fact that he's middle-aged and alone.  Dan Aykroyd gives one of his very best performances because he's playing a  character whose eccentricities help define him rather than label him.  He's not really playing `funny' so much as `quirky'. David Strathairn  steals every scene he's in with his alternately comic and tragic  performance of a highly capable blind team member.  Sidney Poitier,  meanwhile, is surprisingly adept at playing lighthearted comedy, and Ben  Kingsley makes an unusually menacing enemy-far, far different than his  sainted performances in GANDHI and SCHINDLER'S LIST.  It's a true ensemble  production in which everyone pulls their load with aplomb.Why, then,  didn't this film do better at the box office?The very fact that this  film successfully integrated thriller, comedy, romance and adventure into a  single script may have hurt.  It was somewhat hard to market because it WAS  so richly textured.  Also, the fact that  it was an original script meant  there was no built-in audience chomping at the bit to see it.  1992 was a  year dominated by derivative films (ALADDIN, HOME ALONE 2, BATMAN RETURNS  and LETHAL WEAPON 3 were the top four movies that year, grossing over $300  million each worldwide), and it was hard for an original voice to be heard.  Still, it did make about $70 million worldwide, making it one of the  biggest grossers of that year's original films.Whatever the case of its  box office's  history, you need to make this film a part of your DVD  collection's present.  No, there's not much in the way of DVD extras, but  sound is important to the plot, and you'll want the crisper audio DVD has  to offer.  Hopefully, though, they'll make a Collector's Edition of this  film for its 10 year anniversary, because the dearth of extra materials is  fairly inexcusable.  With this many stellar cast members, there must've  been great stories about the set.",5,Why can't summer blockbusters be more like this?,963532800,"07 14, 2000",2000,3417,"['SNEAKERS', 'one', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'great', 'box', 'office', 'run', 'being', 'fantastic', 'film', 'fortunately', 'found', 'second', 'life', 'video', 'market', 'maintaining', 'respectable', 'not', 'stellar', 'presence', 'best-seller', 'lists', 'Why', 'continue', 'convert', 'audiences', 'decade', 'release', 'everything', 'expect', 'fun', 'summer', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'get.You', 'know', 'feeling', 'have', 'day', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'going', 'be', 'released', 'one', 'total', 'anticipation', 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'best', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'then', 'go', 'movie', 'totally', 'characters', 'were', 'made', 'cardboard', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'implausible', 'romance', 'was', 'just', 'set', 'decoration', 'SNEAKERS', 'not', 'film', 'SNEAKERS', 'entirely', 'fact', 'SNEAKERS', 'estimation', 'very', 'best', 'fictional', 'action', 'film', '1990s.At', 'heart', 'film', 'very', 'clever', 'character-based', 'script', 'tried', 'true', 'Grecian', 'tragedy', 'thoroughly', 'modern', 'humor', 'cool', 'gadgets', 'genuine', 'intrigue', 'relationships', 'Redford', 'McDonnell-like', 'friendship', 'Redford', 'Kingsley', 'mature', 'complex', 'bringing', 'true', 'character', 'development', 'wake.All', 'made', 'possible', 'phenomenal', 'acting', 'one', 'maybe', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'playing', 'type', 'Redford', 'very', 'much', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'less', 'confident', 'abilities', 'having', 'romantic', 'difficulties', 'fact', 'middle-aged', 'alone', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'performances', 'playing', 'character', 'eccentricities', 'help', 'define', 'rather', 'label', 'not', 'really', 'playing', 'funny', 'so', 'much', 'quirky', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'steals', 'scene', 'alternately', 'comic', 'tragic', 'performance', 'highly', 'capable', 'blind', 'team', 'member', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'meanwhile', 'surprisingly', 'adept', 'playing', 'lighthearted', 'comedy', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'unusually', 'menacing', 'enemy-far', 'far', 'different', 'sainted', 'performances', 'GANDHI', 'SCHINDLER', 'LIST', 'true', 'ensemble', 'production', 'everyone', 'load', 'aplomb.Why', 'then', 'did', ""n't"", 'film', 'do', 'better', 'box', 'office', 'very', 'fact', 'film', 'successfully', 'integrated', 'thriller', 'comedy', 'romance', 'adventure', 'single', 'script', 'may', 'have', 'hurt', 'was', 'somewhat', 'hard', 'market', 'WAS', 'so', 'richly', 'textured', 'Also', 'fact', 'was', 'original', 'script', 'meant', 'was', 'built-in', 'audience', 'chomping', 'bit', 'see', '1992', 'was', 'year', 'dominated', 'derivative', 'films', 'ALADDIN', 'HOME', 'ALONE', '2', 'BATMAN', 'RETURNS', 'LETHAL', 'WEAPON', '3', 'were', 'top', 'four', 'movies', 'year', 'grossing', '300', 'million', 'worldwide', 'was', 'hard', 'original', 'voice', 'be', 'heard', 'Still', 'did', 'make', '70', 'million', 'worldwide', 'making', 'one', 'biggest', 'grossers', 'year', 'original', 'films.Whatever', 'case', 'box', 'office', 'history', 'need', 'make', 'film', 'part', 'DVD', 'collection', 'present', 'No', 'not', 'much', 'way', 'DVD', 'extras', 'sound', 'important', 'plot', ""'ll"", 'want', 'crisper', 'audio', 'DVD', 'offer', 'Hopefully', 'though', ""'ll"", 'make', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'film', '10', 'year', 'anniversary', 'dearth', 'extra', 'materials', 'fairly', 'inexcusable', 'many', 'stellar', 'cast', 'members', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'great', 'stories', 'set']",N/A
