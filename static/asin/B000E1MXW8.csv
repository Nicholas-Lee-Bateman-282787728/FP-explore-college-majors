965908,A1PS4EZLXYMNPF,B000E1MXW8,"BRADLEY R HUTSON ""hutsman""","[26, 29]","This disc represents a scary and disturbing possibility:  That Warner Bros. is brushing off releasing the rest of the seasons of ""Night Court"" in favor of offering this poorly selected group of episodes as a kind of ""peace offering.""  I've even heard that these are not even the original NBC broadcast versions, but rather the edited syndication versions.  I've never known Warner to release anything other than uncut episodes of a TV show before.  But, I know there is always that possibility, since other publishers have certainly done it already.  The REALLY scary part of it is just this:  If this disc performs poorly, it very well could be the final nail in the coffin of the hope of any more uncut season sets to be released.  BUT, how can Warner Bros. realistically expect true fans of the show to buy such an inferior product as this?  It's no secret that we are all craving the full season sets in uncut format.  If Warner feels that the first season set did not sell enough copies, then here's a good idea:  Get more copies of the set available at retailers!  When the season one set first became available, I noticed that a lot of the stores around here did not even have it!  Those that did soon sold out, but almost all of them never restocked it!  It seems to me that since the first shipment sold well and quickly, more shipments should have followed.  But the slots that had been occupied by ""Night Court"" were then filled by something else, and it never seemed to show up again.  It's almost like it got lost in the shuffle of a continually changing store lineup of available titles.  I sincerely believe that it would have done much better if given the chance.Even though buying this disc might send a message to Warner that ""Night Court"" is not dead, I can't bring myself to support this lackluster offering.  We all have to take a stand and send a message to Warner that this disc belongs in the garbage by NOT buying it.  Let's all appeal to them via e-mail or snail mail to resume complete season sets of the original NBC versions.  There is no doubt in my mind that season two would be gobbled up immediately.  All they would have to do is put it out there, and give it better exposure than season one.  We would DEFINITELY take care of the rest.",1,I Hope This is Nothing More Than a Stall Tactic...,1136592000,"01 7, 2006",2006,2270,"['disc', 'scary', 'disturbing', 'possibility', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'brushing', 'off', 'releasing', 'rest', 'seasons', 'Night', 'Court', 'favor', 'offering', 'poorly', 'selected', 'group', 'episodes', 'kind', 'peace', 'offering', ""'ve"", 'even', 'heard', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'original', 'NBC', 'broadcast', 'versions', 'rather', 'edited', 'syndication', 'versions', ""'ve"", 'never', 'known', 'Warner', 'release', 'anything', 'other', 'uncut', 'episodes', 'TV', 'show', 'know', 'always', 'possibility', 'other', 'publishers', 'have', 'certainly', 'done', 'already', 'REALLY', 'scary', 'part', 'just', 'disc', 'poorly', 'very', 'well', 'could', 'be', 'final', 'nail', 'coffin', 'hope', 'more', 'uncut', 'season', 'sets', 'be', 'released', 'BUT', 'how', 'can', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'realistically', 'expect', 'true', 'fans', 'show', 'buy', 'inferior', 'product', 'secret', 'are', 'craving', 'full', 'season', 'sets', 'uncut', 'format', 'Warner', 'first', 'season', 'set', 'did', 'not', 'sell', 'enough', 'copies', 'then', 'here', 'good', 'idea', 'Get', 'more', 'copies', 'set', 'available', 'retailers', 'When', 'season', 'one', 'set', 'first', 'became', 'available', 'noticed', 'lot', 'stores', 'here', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'have', 'did', 'soon', 'sold', 'out', 'almost', 'never', 'restocked', 'first', 'shipment', 'sold', 'well', 'quickly', 'more', 'shipments', 'should', 'have', 'followed', 'slots', 'had', 'been', 'occupied', 'Night', 'Court', 'were', 'then', 'filled', 'something', 'else', 'never', 'seemed', 'show', 'up', 'again', 'almost', 'got', 'lost', 'shuffle', 'continually', 'changing', 'store', 'lineup', 'available', 'titles', 'sincerely', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'given', 'chance.Even', 'buying', 'disc', 'might', 'send', 'message', 'Warner', 'Night', 'Court', 'not', 'dead', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'support', 'lackluster', 'offering', 'have', 'take', 'stand', 'send', 'message', 'Warner', 'disc', 'belongs', 'garbage', 'NOT', 'buying', 'Let', 'appeal', 'e-mail', 'snail', 'mail', 'resume', 'complete', 'season', 'sets', 'original', 'NBC', 'versions', 'doubt', 'mind', 'season', 'two', 'would', 'be', 'gobbled', 'up', 'immediately', 'would', 'have', 'do', 'put', 'there', 'give', 'better', 'exposure', 'season', 'one', 'would', 'DEFINITELY', 'take', 'care', 'rest']",Night Court
965909,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000E1MXW8,calvinnme,"[7, 7]","There are two parts to my review - an informative portion, and then a rant. First, the informative portion:There are only six episodes on this DVD:All You Need is Love - Season 1 (January 4, 1984)Her Honor, Part 1 - Season 4 (aired April 29, 1987)Her Honor, Part 2 - Season 4 (aired May 6, 1987)Death of a Bailiff - Season 5 (aired October 15, 1987)Who Was that Mashed Man? - Season 5 (aired November 19, 1987)Fire - Season 6 (aired November 2, 1988)""All You Need is Love"" was the series premiere and is redundant if you already own season one, the only season of Night court on DVD.""Her Honor"" was actually a 4-part episode that spanned the fourth and fifth seasons. In these episodes, Harry is not reappointed to his judgeship and Christine is given the opportunity to be appointed instead. This is an odd choice since you only get the the first two episodes of the 4-parter, but not the resolution of the entire situation.""Death of a Bailiff"" has Bull being struck by lightning and surviving. When he recovers he says that God has told him to give away everything he owns. Bull sets up shop in the courthouse and proceeds to follow his divine directive.""Who Was that Mashed Man?"" has Dan's evil boss tasking Dan to look after his attractive niece. The other subplot has Harry having to rule against an actor who used to portray a superhero who wants to be able to dress up as his character in public. As a result, the actor becomes suicidally despondent and Harry must try to talk the old actor into wanting to keep on living.""Fire"" has everyone retreating to the morgue for shelter from a fire in the courthouse. Meanwhile, Dan is awaiting the election returns to find out if he has been successful in his bid for State Assemblyman.If you're young enough to have never seen Night Court before, it might be worth the low price of admission to purchase this, but if you are at all familiar with the series I think this compilation is a waste of time. It is too small a dose of the show and the episodes are not the very best of the series.Now for the ranting portion of my review. Warner Brothers has shown tremendous insight into what audiences want with their DVD's and boxed sets of classic movies over the last five years. That's why I can't figure out why they don't have the same insight when it comes to one of the most original and timelessly funny shows ever aired. Unfortunately, it took time for Night Court to reach its ""classic phase"", which really didn't start until the beginning of season three in 1985 when Markie Post began playing public defender Christine Sullivan, and ended in 1989 when creator Reinhold Weege left the series. Those four seasons were just about perfect, but that is not to say that the other five were turkeys by any stretch, and I think the show remained very funny up to the end in spite of a few misfires. However, season one was the weakest of all the seasons with the weakest cast - Mac wasn't even the court clerk back then - as the series struggled to find its way. So, naturally, sales of season one are going to be weak too. The attitude WB has taken with Night Court would be the same as if they had started their release of classic movies to DVD with the obscure ""Ice Follies of 1939"", and when sales were weak assumed that it would be a waste of time to restore and release ""Casablanca"" or ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"". I know this is an exaggeration, but the logic is the same in both cases.WB should release the subsequent seasons of Night Court. I guarantee that fans like myself that had a standing date with my TV to watch the show every week will yield a return on the studio's investment.",2,Not even close to the best episodes of a classic comedy series,1181952000,"06 16, 2007",2007,3654,"['are', 'two', 'parts', 'review', 'informative', 'portion', 'then', 'rant', 'First', 'informative', 'portion', 'are', 'only', 'six', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'Need', 'Love', 'Season', '1', 'January', '4', '1984', 'Honor', 'Part', '1', 'Season', '4', 'aired', 'April', '29', '1987', 'Honor', 'Part', '2', 'Season', '4', 'aired', 'May', '6', '1987', 'Death', 'Bailiff', 'Season', '5', 'aired', 'October', '15', '1987', 'Who', 'Was', 'Mashed', 'Man', 'Season', '5', 'aired', 'November', '19', '1987', 'Fire', 'Season', '6', 'aired', 'November', '2', '1988', 'Need', 'Love', 'was', 'series', 'premiere', 'redundant', 'already', 'own', 'season', 'one', 'only', 'season', 'Night', 'court', 'DVD', 'Honor', 'was', 'actually', '4-part', 'episode', 'spanned', 'fourth', 'fifth', 'seasons', 'episodes', 'Harry', 'not', 'reappointed', 'judgeship', 'Christine', 'given', 'opportunity', 'be', 'appointed', 'instead', 'odd', 'choice', 'only', 'get', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', '4-parter', 'not', 'resolution', 'entire', 'situation', 'Death', 'Bailiff', 'Bull', 'being', 'struck', 'lightning', 'surviving', 'When', 'God', 'told', 'give', 'away', 'everything', 'Bull', 'up', 'shop', 'courthouse', 'proceeds', 'follow', 'divine', 'directive', 'Who', 'Was', 'Mashed', 'Man', 'Dan', 'evil', 'boss', 'tasking', 'Dan', 'look', 'attractive', 'niece', 'other', 'subplot', 'Harry', 'having', 'rule', 'actor', 'who', 'used', 'portray', 'superhero', 'who', 'be', 'able', 'dress', 'up', 'character', 'public', 'result', 'actor', 'suicidally', 'despondent', 'Harry', 'must', 'try', 'talk', 'old', 'actor', 'wanting', 'keep', 'living', 'Fire', 'everyone', 'retreating', 'morgue', 'shelter', 'fire', 'courthouse', 'Meanwhile', 'Dan', 'awaiting', 'election', 'find', 'out', 'been', 'successful', 'bid', 'State', 'Assemblyman.If', ""'re"", 'young', 'enough', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Night', 'Court', 'might', 'be', 'low', 'price', 'admission', 'purchase', 'are', 'familiar', 'series', 'think', 'compilation', 'waste', 'time', 'too', 'small', 'dose', 'show', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'best', 'series.Now', 'ranting', 'portion', 'review', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'shown', 'tremendous', 'insight', 'what', 'audiences', 'want', 'DVD', 'boxed', 'sets', 'classic', 'movies', 'last', 'five', 'years', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'insight', 'when', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'timelessly', 'funny', 'shows', 'ever', 'aired', 'Unfortunately', 'took', 'time', 'Night', 'Court', 'reach', 'classic', 'phase', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'start', 'beginning', 'season', 'three', '1985', 'when', 'Markie', 'Post', 'began', 'playing', 'public', 'defender', 'Christine', 'Sullivan', 'ended', '1989', 'when', 'creator', 'Reinhold', 'Weege', 'left', 'series', 'four', 'seasons', 'were', 'just', 'perfect', 'not', 'say', 'other', 'five', 'were', 'turkeys', 'stretch', 'think', 'show', 'remained', 'very', 'funny', 'end', 'spite', 'few', 'misfires', 'However', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'weakest', 'seasons', 'weakest', 'cast', 'Mac', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'court', 'clerk', 'back', 'then', 'series', 'struggled', 'find', 'way', 'So', 'naturally', 'sales', 'season', 'one', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'weak', 'too', 'attitude', 'WB', 'taken', 'Night', 'Court', 'would', 'be', 'same', 'had', 'started', 'release', 'classic', 'movies', 'DVD', 'obscure', 'Ice', 'Follies', '1939', 'when', 'sales', 'were', 'weak', 'assumed', 'would', 'be', 'waste', 'time', 'restore', 'release', 'Casablanca', 'Treasure', 'Sierra', 'Madre', 'know', 'exaggeration', 'logic', 'same', 'cases.WB', 'should', 'release', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'Night', 'Court', 'guarantee', 'fans', 'had', 'standing', 'date', 'TV', 'watch', 'show', 'week', 'will', 'yield', 'return', 'studio', 'investment']",Night Court

Maybe they should look at all the reviews on here and other sites to realize the fans ain't buying so I will not buy this Warner can stick this DVD were the sun don't shine for all I care.,1,Warner Brothers can stick it,1137715200,"01 20, 2006",2006,507,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'am', 'huge', 'Night', 'Court', 'fan', 'However', 'agree', 'everyone', 'here', 'pathetic', 'cash', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'must', 'have', 'brains', 'size', 'peanuts', 'think', 'people', 'are', 'gon', 'buy', 'mean', 'waited', 'months', 'season', 'two', 'am', 'not', 'pleased', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'are', 'offering', 'instead', 'Maybe', 'should', 'look', 'reviews', 'here', 'other', 'sites', 'realize', 'fans', 'ai', ""n't"", 'buying', 'so', 'will', 'not', 'buy', 'Warner', 'can', 'stick', 'DVD', 'were', 'sun', 'do', ""n't"", 'shine', 'care']",Night Court

The reasons behind this set are first - to get people who might not buy a season set. Second - they wanted to get a few Markie Post episodes out there. Since she only has one episode in season two, and doesn't become a regular until season three... Warner decided to push a few of her episodes on this compilation.

Jaworski ""jawsomatic""","[3, 4]","First things first, I am a fan of ""Night Court"", but I'll be the first one to admit that this show really didn't come alive until season four when everyone got into place.  Even creator Reinhold Weege admitted that.  There are moments that I do love within those first three seasons, and it's a shame that the late Selma Diamond was only able to shine her comic brilliance for only two seasons.Let's be honest here though, the reason season one's numbers weren't too high is because it wasn't yet what it came to be (I hope that makes sense).  In case you were wondering, I did purchase a copy of the compilation.  I can't think of a better way to rate something unless I see it.  Also, why the hell would anyone want to boycott this DVD?  1) To boycott it would surely spell the end of a season two release, 2) It's still ""Night Court"", regardless of the season, you'll still get laughs from it and enjoy it.OK, OK, so the company picked out what THEY thought were the best shows.  Well guess what, I thought they were pretty damn good.  It included the pilot, which ya gotta have, uncut mind you. These episodes were not the syndicated versions.It may not the best compliation, & it may not be the favorite compilation.  Right now though, it's the best way to enjoy a show when it finally hit its mark & started its way to become a classic show.

That's what most of the reviewers here at Amazon for Warner's Television Favorites DVD of ""Night Court"" have attempted to do . . . they are simply expressing their displeasure for Warner's release of this sampler DVD (which most admit they wouldn't buy) over full season sets, rather than actually reviewing the DVD.  Incidentally, none of the other ""Television Favorites"" sampler DVDs released by Warner have received these overwhelmingly negative ratings at Amazon.  In the case of two of them, ""F-Troop"" and ""Cheyenne,"" sales of the samplers have resulted in planned season 1 releases by Warner Home Video for June 2006.Let's take a look at this DVD and review it on its own merits.  The video presentation on the DVD is pretty much what you would expect for a series recorded on videotape from the 1980s . . . reasonably sharp, but certainly not up to the high definition standards of modern sitcoms.  Overall, the audio/video presentation is fairly solid throughout and fans of the show will not be disappointed in that aspect.  There are six episodes in this collection, not five as a few reviewers have indicated.  Some other reviews have also suggested that these are cut, syndicated episodes.  Again, that's not the case; episodes average around 23 and a half to about 24 minutes . . . the correct running times for a half-hour television series that began broadcasts in the mid-1980s.Is this a perfect DVD?  No, it's not and, like many, I would prefer seeing full season releases for television series that are released on DVD.  The DVD is a ""bare bones"" affair; there are no extras included, unlike the season 1 release which included a documentary about the show and series creator Reinhold Weege's commentary on the pilot episode.  This DVD drops the Weege commentary on the pilot, the only episode that's repeated from the season 1 release; the other episodes are from seasons 4, 5, and 6.  On the plus side, English, French and Spanish subtitles are offered.  On balance, it's a fun little collection that offers a few evenings of enjoyable comedy and, if full season sets are not released by Warner Home Video in the future, those who have this DVD will be able to enjoy some episodes beyond the first season.  Finally, if you want another independent review of this DVD by someone who has actually seen it, visit Sitcomsonline.com where the reviewer gave this DVD a four star (out of five) rating; I concur.",4,"Judging the ""Night Court"" DVD on its own merits",1142294400,"03 14, 2006",2006,2517,"['How', 'can', 'one', 'write', 'objective', 'review', 'product', 'even', 'seeing', 'purchasing', 'what', 'most', 'reviewers', 'here', 'Amazon', 'Warner', 'Television', 'Favorites', 'DVD', 'Night', 'Court', 'have', 'attempted', 'do', 'are', 'simply', 'expressing', 'displeasure', 'Warner', 'release', 'sampler', 'DVD', 'most', 'admit', 'would', ""n't"", 'buy', 'full', 'season', 'sets', 'rather', 'actually', 'reviewing', 'DVD', 'Incidentally', 'none', 'other', 'Television', 'Favorites', 'sampler', 'DVDs', 'released', 'Warner', 'have', 'received', 'overwhelmingly', 'negative', 'ratings', 'Amazon', 'case', 'two', 'F-Troop', 'Cheyenne', 'sales', 'samplers', 'have', 'resulted', 'planned', 'season', '1', 'releases', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'June', '2006.Let', 'take', 'look', 'DVD', 'review', 'own', 'merits', 'video', 'presentation', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'series', 'recorded', 'videotape', '1980s', 'reasonably', 'sharp', 'certainly', 'not', 'high', 'definition', 'standards', 'modern', 'sitcoms', 'Overall', 'audio/video', 'presentation', 'fairly', 'solid', 'fans', 'show', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'aspect', 'are', 'six', 'episodes', 'collection', 'not', 'five', 'few', 'reviewers', 'have', 'indicated', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'also', 'suggested', 'are', 'cut', 'syndicated', 'episodes', 'Again', 'not', 'case', 'average', '23', 'half', '24', 'minutes', 'correct', 'running', 'times', 'half-hour', 'television', 'series', 'began', 'broadcasts', 'mid-1980s.Is', 'perfect', 'DVD', 'No', 'not', 'many', 'would', 'prefer', 'seeing', 'full', 'season', 'releases', 'television', 'series', 'are', 'released', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'bare', 'bones', 'affair', 'are', 'extras', 'included', 'season', '1', 'release', 'included', 'documentary', 'show', 'series', 'creator', 'Reinhold', 'Weege', 'commentary', 'pilot', 'episode', 'DVD', 'Weege', 'commentary', 'pilot', 'only', 'episode', 'repeated', 'season', '1', 'release', 'other', 'episodes', 'are', 'seasons', '4', '5', '6', 'plus', 'side', 'English', 'French', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'are', 'offered', 'balance', 'fun', 'little', 'collection', 'few', 'evenings', 'enjoyable', 'comedy', 'full', 'season', 'sets', 'are', 'not', 'released', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'future', 'who', 'have', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'Finally', 'want', 'independent', 'review', 'DVD', 'someone', 'who', 'actually', 'seen', 'Sitcomsonline.com', 'where', 'reviewer', 'gave', 'DVD', 'four', 'star', 'five', 'rating', 'concur']",Night Court

The reason I have it is because there are a lot of episodes I may have missed when it first aired and so on.  Season two is when I started paying attention, even more so when Christine came into the picture (not sure which season that was.)  Hell, she still looks good last I saw her in ""There's Something About Mary,""There's Something More About Mary (Widescreen Collector's Edition)but never mind.  Anyway, I have written a review for ""The Wayans Brothers"" collection made by WB, also, and am a fan of both shows.The Wayans Bros - The Complete First SeasonI've waited this long to no avail for the other seasons and to find out that at least Night Court has this DVD instead of season two?  WOWWWWWWW!  What first season of any collection has ever been as good as the later episodes?  Of course poor sales will become the weakest part of a lot of collections when the shows first started.  Check this, the people that collect any TV show DVD will want the first seasons of a collection, regardless of its strength because they are fans.  Happy to know it exists, they await the season they look forward to and come back to get the first season for their collection (some people don't purchase in order, they purchase their favorites first.)  I can't think of an example right now, maybe someone reading this review can help with that if they agree, but if Warner continues to focus on sales of the first seasons of different shows, we may continue to see these ""incomplete collections"" dubbed TV Favorites that people will not buy because they feel cheated waiting for the real deal, like Me!  I know what's happening and I'm not going for it because WB's just taking the easy way out.  By that, I mean not even getting the fan's POV and not taking the time and effort to reach it's public to get the sales they need to sell season one.  Sometimes a commercial isn't enough, maybe not package them as a season-by-season basis.  A box-set of all the seasons would be cool because at least it could be on a limited edition type deal with extras included (I think they did that with ""Friends""Friends - The Complete Series Collectionand several others.)  Amazonworld, keep writing your reviews and make it known that it is important to finish something that you start, especially the classics that we've waited to own for decades!
