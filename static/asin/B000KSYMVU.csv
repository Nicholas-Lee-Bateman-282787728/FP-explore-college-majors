Made into a movie by the Director Carroll Ballard, with choreography by Kent Stowell and an incredible set and costumes by Maurice Sendak, it is well worth the newly-released DVD-R to view. Excellent production! Great for adult and child, it is the original intent of the designers of the ""Nutcracker"" and not the watered-down versions now available.

But if you are a fan of Maurice Sendack's clever and whimsical art, this in my opinion is his masterpiece.  Taking that into consideration I was willing to overlook the liberties taken with the story, the added music and the unecessary narration interspersed throuhout this movie version of the ballet.  This performance is as delightful as the Balanchine's movie of the ballet.  The quality of the picture and sound were clear and sharp and the dancing a joy to watch.  I taped this originally when it was shown on PBS and was excited to see it available on a dvd.

Carrol Ballard directed this film and through the use of some dark imagery  took it above just typical childs movie, his production kept this version interesting to adults along with younger people, some of the nightmare like dream sequences are kind of spooky and very young children may have problems with certain scenes. all in all a beautiful scenic production, wonderful, colorful costumes,all the dancers fantastic,even the children were terrific. the sound production is faithfully brought out in all it's glory also.I mentioned on my first review that they had DVD copies available for around $20.00,unfortunately these were cheap -made on a home computer-ripoffs and not factory made and you could tell that.I am still waiting on a good DVD version but so far no luck-you still have to be satisfied with a VHS copy if you can find one. Amazon has a streaming version you can watch or you can buy it for download to your computer for $9.99. Adults and children need to catch this one for Christmas Holidays.6-5-14.

1035578,A1V8ZE9BH0WTXE,B000KSYMVU,cinephiliagal,"[2, 9]","I wanted to like this. I expected to like this, because (1) I love Tchaikovsky's ""The Nutcracker Suite"" ballet, (2) I loved Maurice Sendak's books, and (3) I like classical music. Unfortunately, this movie does not showcase any of the above in its best forms. It winds up very much less than the sum of its parts. You would be far better off watching the version done for PBS by the American Ballet Theater with Mikhail Barishnikov and Gelsey Kirkland, than this. Better yet, bring some young children to see it performed live if you can. They'll never forget it and it will imbue the ballet itself with that magical nostalgia that people seem to be pouring into their reviews of this particular version.I get the sense that if any of these 5- and 4-star reviewers had seen a live performance of The Nutcracker Suite, or the PBS American Ballet Theater/Baryshnikov/Kirkland version of The Nutcracker, you would have gotten the same response and they would be giving glowing reviews to those versions instead. This is because the source material - Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite ballet - is so fantastic to begin with. It feels very happenstance that many of them say this was the first Nutcracker they saw AND they first saw it as children -- so of course it's the one they love.I recall one of my nephews being enraptured with the PBS/American Ballet Theater version of The Nutcracker one Christmas Eve when we had tuned to PBS to watch it. He was about 6 at the time and he sat like 3 feet from the television, mouth open in wonder from start to finish. Clearly, if you show ANY version of The Nutcracker to small children, they're going to love it. I would NOT show children this version if you want them to like classical music or ballet or even opera, because this mashup of film and ballet does a disservice to ballet, to the Nutcracker, to Tchaikovsky, and to all well-filmed versions of ballets and operas (which actually do exist).In this Nutcracker, the narration, the special effects, and the way the film of the ballet is shot, all smacks of shoving Tchaikovsky's beautiful ballet into a ""children's movie"" format to make it more palatable for non-classical-music oriented audiences. Unfortunately, the film, the ballet and the music all suffer as a result.Let's start with the voice over/narration. In no version of Tchaikovsky's music for The Nutcracker, and in no performance of the ballet, is there supposed to be voice over narration. The voice over is intrusive and unnecessary - I don't care if it's taken from the Hoffman novella on which Tchaikovsky based his ballet, or not. This story can be told in a dialogue-less, narration-less form, purely visually - and virtually every filmed version of this ballet that I've seen does it better than this film.That's part of the whole magic of Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker (and all ballets): the story is told via the music and the dance: the choreography, the sets, the costumes. There is no narration because it doesn't need any.Then let's go over the way it is filmed. When you see ballet live, you get to see the entire stage and all the performers dancing at once. This is part of the spectacle and what makes the performance so impressive - all those dancers moving in unison with each other and with the music, telling a story beautifully. The usual conventions are used: sets, lighting (including spot lighting, dimming, and brightening of particular lights on specific parts of the stage), costumes - and, of course, the music and the dancing.Film is a totally different medium, with a totally different visual language. It can be employed to tell a story utterly without dialogue. But the version of visual language most often used for live action movies is not the best way to showcase a ballet. It necessarily favors close-ups of faces over long shots of dancing bodies. The vast majority of this movie could have been greatly enhanced by exploiting specific conventions of the visual story telling language of film.For example, edits between close ups of the dancers' faces and medium- and long-shots of them dancing could have used long dissolves or super-impositions of close-ups and long shots. In my opinion, this would have greatly improved both the translation of the ballet to film and the telling of the story itself. It would also have negated the need for voice over narration. The way this film was designed and edited is shockingly unimaginative and greatly limits the beauty of the ballet and its story.Now let's consider the costumes: it is not until 2/3 of the way into the film that you see any costuming that is specific to Maurice Sendak. The vast majority of the costumes and sets are utterly conventional Nutcracker costumes. Therefore, the use of Sendak's costuming as a selling point of this film is more than a little disingenuous, because it is hardly a showcase of purely Sendak-ian costuming and/or set design; most of the costuming is very traditional Nutcracker-performance derived, if you've ever seen more than one version of the ballet.Other people's criticism of the godfather/uncle character as a pedophile seems to me to say a lot more about them than about the ballet itself. To me, as played in this film, the uncle as genius clock- and toy-maker is someone who fits in neither with the other adults, because of his child-like fascination with toys, nor with the children, because he is an adult. This is most obviously shown in the early scene where he dances with his niece for whom the nutcracker and other toys were made. He has nowhere near the physical confidence, knowledge, carriage or comfort level with the steps and moves of the dance itself than do the adults around him or even his niece. He reminds me of one of those wacky uncles or aunts you loved as a kid because they had all kinds of old toys, dolls, train sets, and other cool stuff that kids love, but at the same time you knew somehow that he/she was a bit weird.It's not until you're grown yourself that you realize his/her lack of adult companionship was odd, and that it was a little weird that they had all this kid stuff as grown-ups - that it was kind of Peter Pan-ish or maybe Asperger's-ish. But then it probably takes a bit of Asperger's to be such a great clock- and toy-maker, and it is mentioned multiple times in the voice over that he is a 'genius.' I've always speculated that Tchaikovsky considered the uncle/godfather a stand-in for himself - someone bringing beautiful things to life, who didn't fit in with conventional adults or society, though he was dependent on their patronage to realize his dreams. (Also, he would hardly have been a pedophile for little girls, as Tchaikovsky himself was a homosexual, though he did have an odd but chaste relationship with his main patron, a rich noblewoman.)The creepy part is the dream/nightmare that the toys can come to life, and the niece's sense or fear that the uncle may have imbued the toys with the ability to come to life. But this is a common scary dream/nightmare theme in young children: that mechanical objects might come to life and operate themselves. It's sort of the flip-side (or dark side) of playing with and anthropomorphizing toys. One might even say it is an inherent human fear of all toys and tools: that they might have a life of their own, other than the life where we wield them. This fear has been exploited in any number of classic as well as modern stories and films.So, in summary, I don't see the pedophile angle in this that others speak of; not sure where they're getting that.Aside from the narration, the inclusion of the duet from Tchaikovsky's opera ""Pique Dame"" is also totally unnecessary and jarring for those of us familiar with the original music itself. It doesn't belong and it does nothing to enhance the soundtrack, the performance, or the storytelling.There is nothing wrong with the Pacific Northwest Ballet's performance (though it could have been filmed far better than it was). There is nothing wrong with the London Symphony's performance of the soundtrack. There is nothing wrong with the costumes or sets (though they are not all that obviously by Maurice Sendak until about 2/3 of the way through the ballet). And there is nothing wrong with filming a ballet.Yet, somehow, combining all of these things results in a disappointingly subpar experience of The Nutcracker. It is neither ground breaking, which I would welcome, nor traditional, which I would also welcome. It's an uncomfortable mish-mash of the two, and combined with the narration, smacks of dumbing down a ballet for mass American children's consumption. The use of green-screens for artificial miniaturization in the early scenes when the niece/god-daughter and other children look into the windows of the clock-work doll house would seem to indicate otherwise, but I found it surprisingly unimaginative, and this lack of imagination in the conception seriously limits it as both movie and filmed ballet.I acknowledge that it is difficult to film ballet and opera performances in the first place, because the inherently different mediums (media?) do not necessarily marry easily. It's not easy to combine the two in ways that please both traditional audiences of opera and ballet and new fans unfamiliar with classical ballet and opera traditions. However, it can be done and it can be done in ways that do not mar the original source.* All it requires is some thoughtfulness and imagination as to how things will be filmed and edited. Unfortunately, I don't have the sense that that thoughtfulness was employed in this production of Nutcracker: The Motion Picture.Anyway, if you specifically want to see a beautiful Nutcracker, I would recommend the PBS filmed version of the ABT/Baryshnikov/Kirkland Nutcracker. If you want to see amazing visual storytelling set to dialogue-less classical music, see the original Fantasia (which you can't even tell is from 1940). If you want to see amazing live-action visual story telling married with dance and with virtually no dialogue, I recommend the French film Le Bal, which tells the story of a dance hall over many decades, from pre-WWII to 1980s disco (you don't need subtitles for it because there is very little dialogue to begin with).This is not worth either the money or the time invested, in my opinion -- not when there are far better versions of The Nutcracker available.*See any of the New York Metropolitan Opera's Live in HD! operas, either in digital projection at movie theaters, or on PBS. Seriously, see these - they are, for the most part, amazingly well done, and many of them are now on DVD. For children, I recommend the DVD of the Met's Live in HD! Rossini opera La Cenerentola, which is Cinderella, with Elina Garanca in the title role.",1,"Disappointing mish-mash, much less than the sum of its parts.

1035585,A2D3H2F628I0HD,B000KSYMVU,Itsoutthere,"[3, 3]","Prior to discovering a recorded VHS version of this in my video cabinet, I'd grown up watching the famous Mikhail Barishnikov version of this ballet and was eager to see another interpretation of this famous story. A couple of points:One thing I never quite understood is the ownership of the nutcracker doll in Act I: traditionally, Drosselmeyer gives the nutcracker to Clara, however, in this one, it is apparently a Christmas tree ornament that the Stahlbaum (Clara's) family have probably had for years.Hugh Bigney is a lot of fun to watch as Herr Drosselmeyer and I love his character design; however, although he cares for Clara, it's especially obvious in the first act that it's a somewhat convoluted relationship. Even though the narrating Clara emphasizes that she loved him and his stories deeply and was in awe of his genius, at the Christmas party Clara is noticeably wary of Drosselmeyer, who seems to enjoy giving her less-than-innocent looks, and they share an awkward dance, although some may argue awkward in a charming way. This feeling is emphasized by Drosselmeyer swiftly departing after, refusing to look Clara in the eyes and leaving her confused and hurt. Although this adds an air of mystery to Drosselmeyer, who is supposed to be mysterious in general, there is definitely a sinister undertone in Bigney's characterization of the character.This version sticks more to the original story by E.T.A. Hoffman in that the Mouse King has seven heads, along with some other details. Also, Clara and the Nutcracker Prince crawl into the Mouse King's coat at one point, which I'm sure does not happen in other interpretations.As noted in other reviews, this interpretation includes an extended face-off between the Prince and Drosselmeyer for Clara's affection in Act II. Although the Nutcracker Prince is Clara's obvious (romantic) interest throughout the ballet, Drosselmeyer makes a point of being the one to conjure up various dances to entertain Clara. This is made especially obvious when Drosselmeyer and the Prince have two or three staredowns at various points in the second act.If I'm correct, some of the pieces are done out of order in relation to Tchaikovsky's original vision, one of them being the Tarentella and the final waltz, which plays during the closing credits. Of course, this is apparently quite common in adaptations of The Nutcracker, but purists should stay away from this adaptation for this reason.There are also some parts that I feel are irrelevant to the overall story: a dream sequence that establishes Fritz's malice (although this is arguably not necessary) and Clara's fear of rats--this dream sequence also seems to establish Drosselmeyer as a magician who is able to grant dreams and nightmares to people, and Clara accepts this as truth due to her naming Drosselmeyer as the one responsible for her nightmare. Also, at one point during the Christmas party, there is an opera-esque performance with three masked dancers which definitely does not appear in the original score.In comparison to the Barishnikov version that I have, this is visually much richer in sets and costumes than Barishnikov's minimalist interpretation. I particularly enjoy the opening sequence with all of Drosselmeyer's clocks and his designing and making of the dollhouse for Clara.Wade Walthall sports a Salvador Dali mustache as the Nutcracker Prince. Just saying :)This is a decent adaptation of the Nutcracker, but Drosselmeyer's ambiguous morality and his faceoffs with the prince add a sinister and arguably unnecessary dynamic to the work. Also, there are bits and parts that I feel are irrelevant to the story at large. But still, a good effort on their part.",4,"A couple of faults, but overall still nice",1324598400,"12 23, 2011",2011,3699,"['Prior', 'discovering', 'recorded', 'VHS', 'version', 'video', 'cabinet', ""'d"", 'grown', 'up', 'watching', 'famous', 'Mikhail', 'Barishnikov', 'version', 'ballet', 'was', 'eager', 'see', 'interpretation', 'famous', 'story', 'couple', 'points', 'One', 'thing', 'never', 'quite', 'understood', 'ownership', 'nutcracker', 'doll', 'Act', 'traditionally', 'Drosselmeyer', 'nutcracker', 'Clara', 'however', 'one', 'apparently', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'ornament', 'Stahlbaum', 'Clara', 'family', 'have', 'probably', 'had', 'years.Hugh', 'Bigney', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'Herr', 'Drosselmeyer', 'love', 'character', 'design', 'however', 'Clara', 'especially', 'obvious', 'first', 'act', 'somewhat', 'convoluted', 'relationship', 'Even', 'narrating', 'Clara', 'loved', 'stories', 'deeply', 'was', 'awe', 'genius', 'Christmas', 'party', 'Clara', 'noticeably', 'wary', 'Drosselmeyer', 'who', 'enjoy', 'giving', 'less-than-innocent', 'looks', 'share', 'awkward', 'dance', 'may', 'argue', 'awkward', 'charming', 'way', 'feeling', 'emphasized', 'Drosselmeyer', 'swiftly', 'departing', 'refusing', 'look', 'Clara', 'eyes', 'leaving', 'confused', 'hurt', 'air', 'mystery', 'Drosselmeyer', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'mysterious', 'general', 'definitely', 'sinister', 'undertone', 'Bigney', 'characterization', 'character.This', 'version', 'sticks', 'more', 'original', 'story', 'E.T.A', 'Hoffman', 'Mouse', 'King', 'seven', 'heads', 'other', 'details', 'Also', 'Clara', 'Nutcracker', 'Prince', 'crawl', 'Mouse', 'King', 'coat', 'one', 'point', ""'m"", 'sure', 'not', 'happen', 'other', 'interpretations.As', 'noted', 'other', 'reviews', 'interpretation', 'extended', 'face-off', 'Prince', 'Drosselmeyer', 'Clara', 'affection', 'Act', 'II', 'Nutcracker', 'Prince', 'Clara', 'obvious', 'romantic', 'interest', 'ballet', 'Drosselmeyer', 'point', 'being', 'one', 'conjure', 'up', 'various', 'dances', 'entertain', 'Clara', 'made', 'especially', 'obvious', 'when', 'Drosselmeyer', 'Prince', 'have', 'two', 'three', 'staredowns', 'various', 'points', 'second', 'act.If', ""'m"", 'correct', 'pieces', 'are', 'done', 'order', 'relation', 'Tchaikovsky', 'original', 'vision', 'one', 'being', 'Tarentella', 'final', 'waltz', 'closing', 'credits', 'course', 'apparently', 'quite', 'common', 'adaptations', 'Nutcracker', 'purists', 'should', 'stay', 'away', 'adaptation', 'reason.There', 'are', 'also', 'parts', 'feel', 'are', 'irrelevant', 'overall', 'story', 'dream', 'sequence', 'Fritz', 'malice', 'arguably', 'not', 'necessary', 'Clara', 'fear', 'rats', 'dream', 'sequence', 'also', 'establish', 'Drosselmeyer', 'magician', 'who', 'able', 'grant', 'dreams', 'nightmares', 'people', 'Clara', 'truth', 'due', 'naming', 'Drosselmeyer', 'one', 'responsible', 'nightmare', 'Also', 'one', 'point', 'Christmas', 'party', 'opera-esque', 'performance', 'three', 'masked', 'dancers', 'definitely', 'not', 'appear', 'original', 'score.In', 'comparison', 'Barishnikov', 'version', 'have', 'visually', 'much', 'richer', 'sets', 'costumes', 'Barishnikov', 'minimalist', 'interpretation', 'particularly', 'enjoy', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Drosselmeyer', 'clocks', 'designing', 'making', 'dollhouse', 'Clara.Wade', 'Walthall', 'sports', 'Salvador', 'Dali', 'mustache', 'Nutcracker', 'Prince', 'Just', 'saying', 'decent', 'adaptation', 'Nutcracker', 'Drosselmeyer', 'ambiguous', 'morality', 'faceoffs', 'prince', 'add', 'sinister', 'arguably', 'unnecessary', 'dynamic', 'work', 'Also', 'are', 'bits', 'parts', 'feel', 'are', 'irrelevant', 'story', 'large', 'still', 'good', 'effort', 'part']",N/A

However, I give this production a &#34;meh - could have been better.&#34; The music is just as magical, the costumes indeed are gorgeous - exquisite, even - but there's something lacking here that I can't quite put my finger on... Maybe the way it ended?I was amused by the tension between the nutcracker prince and the mysterious Drosselmeyer. The nutcracker hero appears jealous of Clara's godfather, and I don't think Drosselmeyer was bothered by this. I love the magic and mystery that he poured into Clara's dreams.I didn't like how uncomfortable the young child, Clara, felt around Drosselmeyer, especially at the beginning of the film. If he was her godfather, and if as the narrator stated she &#34;loved&#34; him, why was she so unnerved by his presence? Maybe because he was so strange that she couldn't understand him.I did, however, like, the romantic dances between Clara and her nutcracker. I also liked the frothy dresses that swirled around the sugar plum fairy and the others as they danced. One of my favorite Nutcracker melodies is the dance of the Russians, and this was accompanied by three dark-skinned, shirtless, muscular males who bounced around the stage energetically.  :)Giive this movie a try - see what you think! - and add it to your list of holiday traditions this Christmas :)",3,Magic & Mystery - Though Leaves Something to Be Desired,1387238400,"12 17, 2013",2013,1441,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'Nutcracker', 'twice', 'person', 'once', 'Boston', 'time', 'Cincinnati', 'so', 'was', 'thrilled', 'find', 'Netflix', 'However', 'give', 'production', '34', 'meh', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better.', '34', 'music', 'just', 'as', 'magical', 'costumes', 'indeed', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'exquisite', 'even', 'something', 'lacking', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'put', 'finger', 'Maybe', 'way', 'ended', 'was', 'amused', 'tension', 'nutcracker', 'prince', 'mysterious', 'Drosselmeyer', 'nutcracker', 'hero', 'jealous', 'Clara', 'godfather', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Drosselmeyer', 'was', 'bothered', 'love', 'magic', 'mystery', 'poured', 'Clara', 'dreams.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'uncomfortable', 'young', 'child', 'Clara', 'felt', 'Drosselmeyer', 'especially', 'beginning', 'film', 'was', 'godfather', 'narrator', 'stated', '34', 'loved', '34', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'unnerved', 'presence', 'Maybe', 'was', 'so', 'strange', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'him.I', 'did', 'however', 'romantic', 'dances', 'Clara', 'nutcracker', 'also', 'liked', 'frothy', 'dresses', 'swirled', 'sugar', 'plum', 'fairy', 'others', 'danced', 'One', 'favorite', 'Nutcracker', 'melodies', 'dance', 'Russians', 'was', 'accompanied', 'three', 'dark-skinned', 'shirtless', 'muscular', 'males', 'who', 'bounced', 'stage', 'energetically', 'Giive', 'movie', 'try', 'see', 'what', 'think', 'add', 'list', 'holiday', 'traditions', 'Christmas']",N/A
