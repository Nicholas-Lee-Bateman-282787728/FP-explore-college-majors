So, I pop the disc in and low and behold... it's in 4:3 blurry vision.  I've been watching NFL games in HD now for 4 years and was expecting 16:9 versions of the games (silly me; I forgot to ask for that too)!  Not Blu-Ray versions mind you, but standard def 480p 16:9 enhanced games.  Pretty basic stuff for 2007 if you ask me.  I went back on-line to check if this was user error on my part and that it was me who picked the fool screen version by mistake.  Unfortunately this is the only version available, so I'm gonna pass this set on to my dad who still watches fool screen.  I hope this set gets a proper DVD release in the future.Guess it really was too good to be true.jd",2,Classic NFL Games in Blurry Vision,1191369600,"10 3, 2007",2007,818,"['was', 'so', 'excited', 'get', 'set', 'was', 'finally', 'getting', 'what', 'asked', 'NFL', 'complete', 'games', 'not', 'highlight', 'reels', 'DVD', 'So', 'pop', 'disc', 'low', 'behold', '4:3', 'blurry', 'vision', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'NFL', 'games', 'HD', 'now', '4', 'years', 'was', 'expecting', '16:9', 'versions', 'games', 'silly', 'forgot', 'ask', 'too', 'Not', 'Blu-Ray', 'versions', 'mind', 'standard', 'def', '480p', '16:9', 'enhanced', 'games', 'Pretty', 'basic', 'stuff', '2007', 'ask', 'went', 'back', 'on-line', 'check', 'was', 'user', 'error', 'part', 'was', 'who', 'picked', 'fool', 'screen', 'version', 'mistake', 'Unfortunately', 'only', 'version', 'available', ""'m"", 'gon', 'pass', 'set', 'dad', 'who', 'still', 'fool', 'screen', 'hope', 'set', 'proper', 'DVD', 'release', 'future.Guess', 'really', 'was', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true.jd']",Indianapolis Colts: Road to Super Bowl XLI

Samuelson ""Bolski""","[6, 10]","Overall, it's nice to have all four games that will allow me to relive one of the most exciting times for me as a Colts fan. The picture is nice and the editing is crisp and pretty clean. Each game is around 1 hour and 45 minutes long up to 140 minutes long.Other than that, no special features. It's strictly the games with the original network broadcast commentary. However, this DVD along with the companionNFL Super Bowl XLI - Indianapolis Colts Championship DVDthat was released earlier this season as well as theNFL Films - Colts - The Complete History DVDmake a nice set for Colts fans.The one glaring omission is the Prince half-time show. I really wanted to have this as well and I was under the impression from other fans that the Steeler's Road to the Super Bowl DVD included the half-time show, so I'm a little confused as to why the Colts didn't include it, unless I'm mistaken about the Steeler's DVD.Also, the Steeler's DVD had the radio broadcasters doing the play-by-play. I wish they would have done the same for this one. I really didn't want to hear Chris Collingsworth again during the Chiefs game.Overall, you can't go wrong with this. I just wish the Prince half-time show was included!",4,Nice to have but where's Prince???,1188950400,"09 5, 2007",2007,1209,"['Overall', 'nice', 'have', 'four', 'games', 'will', 'allow', 'relive', 'one', 'most', 'exciting', 'times', 'Colts', 'fan', 'picture', 'nice', 'editing', 'crisp', 'pretty', 'clean', 'game', 'around', '1', 'hour', '45', 'minutes', 'long', 'up', '140', 'minutes', 'long.Other', 'special', 'features', 'strictly', 'games', 'original', 'network', 'broadcast', 'commentary', 'However', 'DVD', 'companionNFL', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'XLI', 'Indianapolis', 'Colts', 'Championship', 'DVDthat', 'was', 'released', 'earlier', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'theNFL', 'Films', 'Colts', 'Complete', 'History', 'DVDmake', 'nice', 'set', 'Colts', 'fans.The', 'one', 'glaring', 'omission', 'Prince', 'half-time', 'show', 'really', 'wanted', 'have', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'impression', 'other', 'fans', 'Steeler', 'Road', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'DVD', 'included', 'half-time', 'show', ""'m"", 'little', 'confused', 'why', 'Colts', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', ""'m"", 'mistaken', 'Steeler', 'DVD.Also', 'Steeler', 'DVD', 'had', 'radio', 'broadcasters', 'doing', 'play-by-play', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'same', 'one', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear', 'Chris', 'Collingsworth', 'again', 'Chiefs', 'game.Overall', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'just', 'wish', 'Prince', 'half-time', 'show', 'was', 'included']",Indianapolis Colts: Road to Super Bowl XLI
1083785,A1LVHR5OO45L5V,B000RPD0IC,JAG 2.0,"[0, 0]","Road to Super Bowl XLI is exactly that. It is the path the Colts had to take to reach the Superbowl. It is made up of the network broadcasts of the three playoff games and Superbowl XLI. These are the original broadcasts with their original play-by-play in their entirety.The first game is the Wild Card game at Kansas City in which the Colts surprised the Chiefs by an excellent defensive game which effectively shut down their vaunted running game. The second game is the Divisional contest versus the Baltimore Ravens which, once again, was an away game for the Colts. This matchup against the Ravens was definitely a defensive contest in which points were at a premium. All Colts scoring came from kicker Adam Vinatieri who made good on five field goals which, in a defensive struggle such as this, was enough for the win.The third game was the AFC Championship game at Indianapolis against their arch-rivals - the New England Patriots. I'm sure, most Colts fans would agree that this was the ""real"" Superbowl for the Colts and their victory was certainly satisfying against the team that had defeated them in the playoffs several times. The Colts certainly exercised some demons by defeating their nemesis!Of course, it includes the culmination of their season with the victory over the Chicago Bears to be NFL Champions and hold aloft the Vince Lombardi Trophy. Most interesting of all, the Colts won in the rain, despite being a ""dome team"" and doing so with a punishing, clock-eating running game and a swarming defense despite being labeled a ""finesse team"".This is a must-have for true Colts fans and should be enjoyed over and over again. For the Colts fan, this is a five-star DVD set and worth every penny!",5,Colts were champions.,1394928000,"03 16, 2014",2014,1719,"['Road', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'XLI', 'exactly', 'path', 'Colts', 'had', 'take', 'reach', 'Superbowl', 'made', 'network', 'broadcasts', 'three', 'playoff', 'games', 'Superbowl', 'XLI', 'are', 'original', 'broadcasts', 'original', 'play-by-play', 'entirety.The', 'first', 'game', 'Wild', 'Card', 'game', 'Kansas', 'City', 'Colts', 'surprised', 'Chiefs', 'excellent', 'defensive', 'game', 'effectively', 'shut', 'down', 'vaunted', 'running', 'game', 'second', 'game', 'Divisional', 'contest', 'Baltimore', 'Ravens', 'once', 'again', 'was', 'away', 'game', 'Colts', 'matchup', 'Ravens', 'was', 'definitely', 'defensive', 'contest', 'points', 'were', 'premium', 'Colts', 'scoring', 'came', 'kicker', 'Adam', 'Vinatieri', 'who', 'made', 'good', 'five', 'field', 'goals', 'defensive', 'struggle', 'such', 'was', 'enough', 'win.The', 'third', 'game', 'was', 'AFC', 'Championship', 'game', 'Indianapolis', 'arch-rivals', 'New', 'England', 'Patriots', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'Colts', 'fans', 'would', 'agree', 'was', 'real', 'Superbowl', 'Colts', 'victory', 'was', 'certainly', 'satisfying', 'team', 'had', 'defeated', 'playoffs', 'several', 'times', 'Colts', 'certainly', 'exercised', 'demons', 'defeating', 'nemesis', 'course', 'culmination', 'season', 'victory', 'Chicago', 'Bears', 'be', 'NFL', 'Champions', 'hold', 'aloft', 'Vince', 'Lombardi', 'Trophy', 'Most', 'interesting', 'Colts', 'won', 'rain', 'being', 'dome', 'team', 'doing', 'so', 'punishing', 'clock-eating', 'running', 'game', 'swarming', 'defense', 'being', 'labeled', 'finesse', 'team', '.This', 'must-have', 'true', 'Colts', 'fans', 'should', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'over', 'again', 'Colts', 'fan', 'five-star', 'DVD', 'set', 'worth', 'penny']",Indianapolis Colts: Road to Super Bowl XLI
