""ALS""","[4, 4]","This is definitely Jillian Michaels Yoga - no doubt about it.I pop in this DVD when I want a quick workout that will get my heart pumping that doesn't require any equipment or weights. The moves are challenging and Jillian adds her flavor which I appreciate and enjoy. I also like the girls in the background. A major improvement from the ones in Trouble zones and Banish Fat -- they actually look like they're human and don't smile like Stepford Wives. lol. I hope she sticks with them.While I do enjoy these two workouts, there are a few things I'm not a fan of:1) Some of the moves are done WAY too fast -- for each move you perform reps then hold for 15 seconds. Unless you have major balance skills or there was a lot of editing going on post-production, performing the reps at the speed of Jillian and the girls is very difficult.  They seemed to do it effortlessly, but I think editing made it look like it was easy for them.2) Jillian should have relaxed a bit more in this one -- I appreciate her flavor and her style as she is one of my favorite fitness gurus. But I wish she would have been a little less ""hard core! Who's your daddy! Be a badass in this move!"" etc. These moves don't really require that sort of intense instruction.This DVD is pretty decent.It's a fun DVD to switch up a routine, but not her best effort.

1318095,AWVQR7YYTYJ1L,B0031XYLWG,Brittany Rose,"[17, 19]","I am not someone who enjoys yoga. I like feeling like I've *worked* after a workout and yoga never gave me that feeling - even with the Biggest Loser's 'Weight Loss Yoga'. So I was skeptical when Jillian Michaels released a yoga DVD, but willing to give it a shot. To my surprise, I absolutely love this DVD. It definitely makes you feel like you're working, there's tons of room for progression and self-improvement (and some moves, admittedly, I will probably never master the advanced version of), yet it's also got a nice flow to it that doesn't drag on but makes the workout feel less like work, and more like fun.There are two levels on this DVD, but both of them are relatively comparable. The second level is more challenging in terms of the advanced poses and bonus moves, but after a week or two on Level 1 (depending on your fitness level) you should easily be able to alternate between levels 1 and 2. Each level has a warm-up and cool down, with three circuits of training. Each circuit consists of three moves that are repeated (partially to compensate for switching out arms / legs on certain moves). Between each circuit you also do a 'bonus move' of some sort - in Level 1 it's 'sun salutations', and in Level 2 it's a series of quite challenging balance poses.For someone who's unfamiliar with Jillian Michaels and is expecting a 'love your body and breathe in relaxing breaths' DVD, this is not the yoga workout for you. Jillian combines cardio and movement into each pose before getting you to hold 'power poses' for fifteen seconds to contract the muscles that have just been active. Therefore, it's even more intense than a typical Yoga Flow workout - she expects you to get moving, get your heart rate up, and focus on breathing more to support your muscles than to reach a zen place. That being said, if you're like me and someone who never really 'got' yoga, this DVD will be a welcome change of pace that combines Jillian's tough as nails body weight training with some moves to increase your flexibility, and also change up your routine in general. I find when I don't feel like slugging it out with some hand weights, Yoga Meltdown is a nice variation that doesn't bring on that occasional feeling of dread I get when I eyeball my fitness gear.On the flip side for those who are already big Jillian fans, I'm happy to say her more professional and upbeat persona from her personal line of DVDs is the host here, not her battle axe Biggest Loser trainer self. It's a tiny bit amusing to see Jillian use the odd bit of yoga speak, and she does break out of it during the cooldown by making quips about how she'll ""speak English now"" and that she thought she'd hate yoga, until she found a way that made it work for her - and her devotees. She shows a bit of humanity throughout by showcasing how tough some of the poses really are, especially given she's made it very clear she's not very flexible.I have to say this is one of my favourite workout DVDs these days. I love that you don't need any equipment other than your own body, and I feel there is a good balance of progression between the beginner and advanced versions of each move, and between each level. It's the perfect thing to add to my workout DVD mix and I'm happy I own it!",5,Makes Yoga A Blast - Literally!,1284940800,"09 20, 2010",2010,3264,"['am', 'not', 'someone', 'who', 'yoga', 'feeling', ""'ve"", '*worked*', 'workout', 'yoga', 'never', 'gave', 'feeling', 'even', 'Biggest', 'Loser', ""'Weight"", 'Loss', 'Yoga', 'was', 'skeptical', 'when', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'released', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'willing', 'give', 'shot', 'surprise', 'absolutely', 'love', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'feel', ""'re"", 'working', 'tons', 'room', 'progression', 'self-improvement', 'moves', 'admittedly', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'master', 'advanced', 'version', 'also', 'got', 'nice', 'flow', ""n't"", 'drag', 'workout', 'feel', 'less', 'work', 'more', 'are', 'two', 'levels', 'DVD', 'are', 'relatively', 'comparable', 'second', 'level', 'more', 'challenging', 'terms', 'advanced', 'poses', 'bonus', 'moves', 'week', 'two', 'Level', '1', 'depending', 'fitness', 'level', 'should', 'easily', 'be', 'able', 'alternate', 'levels', '1', '2', 'level', 'warm-up', 'cool', 'down', 'three', 'circuits', 'training', 'circuit', 'three', 'moves', 'are', 'repeated', 'partially', 'compensate', 'switching', 'out', 'arms', '/', 'legs', 'certain', 'moves', 'Between', 'circuit', 'also', 'do', ""'bonus"", 'move', 'sort', 'Level', '1', ""'sun"", 'salutations', 'Level', '2', 'series', 'quite', 'challenging', 'balance', 'poses.For', 'someone', 'who', 'unfamiliar', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'expecting', ""'love"", 'body', 'breathe', 'relaxing', 'breaths', 'DVD', 'not', 'yoga', 'workout', 'Jillian', 'combines', 'cardio', 'movement', 'pose', 'getting', 'hold', ""'power"", 'poses', 'fifteen', 'seconds', 'contract', 'muscles', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'active', 'Therefore', 'even', 'more', 'intense', 'typical', 'Yoga', 'Flow', 'workout', 'get', 'moving', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'focus', 'breathing', 'more', 'support', 'muscles', 'reach', 'zen', 'place', 'being', 'said', ""'re"", 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'really', ""'got"", 'yoga', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'welcome', 'change', 'pace', 'Jillian', 'tough', 'nails', 'body', 'weight', 'training', 'moves', 'increase', 'flexibility', 'also', 'change', 'up', 'routine', 'general', 'find', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'slugging', 'out', 'hand', 'weights', 'Yoga', 'Meltdown', 'nice', 'variation', ""n't"", 'bring', 'occasional', 'feeling', 'dread', 'get', 'when', 'eyeball', 'fitness', 'gear.On', 'flip', 'side', 'who', 'are', 'already', 'big', 'Jillian', 'fans', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'more', 'professional', 'upbeat', 'persona', 'personal', 'line', 'DVDs', 'host', 'here', 'not', 'battle', 'axe', 'Biggest', 'Loser', 'trainer', 'self', 'tiny', 'bit', 'amusing', 'see', 'Jillian', 'odd', 'bit', 'yoga', 'speak', 'break', 'cooldown', 'making', 'quips', 'how', ""'ll"", 'speak', 'English', 'now', 'thought', ""'d"", 'hate', 'yoga', 'found', 'way', 'made', 'work', 'devotees', 'bit', 'humanity', 'showcasing', 'how', 'tough', 'poses', 'really', 'are', 'especially', 'given', 'made', 'very', 'clear', 'not', 'very', 'flexible.I', 'have', 'say', 'one', 'favourite', 'workout', 'DVDs', 'days', 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'equipment', 'other', 'own', 'body', 'feel', 'good', 'balance', 'progression', 'beginner', 'advanced', 'versions', 'move', 'level', 'perfect', 'thing', 'add', 'workout', 'DVD', 'mix', ""'m"", 'happy', 'own']",N/A

Now, if you are looking for a complete mind/body yoga that works your muscles and calms your mind this is not it.  This is like yoga bootcamp.  Jillian takes classic poses, downward dog, camel, triangle, boat, warrior and the like and ""reps it out"", meaning she does repetitions, then she holds the poses for about 15 seconds.  This brings more cardio to the moves and then the strength comes in having to hold the pose.I didn't go into this for a calm, zen-like yoga practice-truly, are you buying Jillian for her zen-line persona, or because you know she is going to work you until you drop?  I have plenty of dvds by Shiva Rea, Sara Ivanhoe, Brian Kest, Erich Schiffman & Alan Finger to do a more traditional practice.  With Jillian I expect for her to be ""outside the box"" and to kick my butt and make it challenging.  I thought it was fun to use the basic yoga poses to build a more powerful cardio workout.  Is it for yoga purists, absolutely not.  Is it fun for a different kind of work out that works your arms, core, butt and legs.  Absolutely.The dvd has two workouts-level one and level two.  Both are a little over 30 minutes long.  Level one is supposed to be the ""easier"" of the two workouts, but I find the plank positions to be more challenging for me and did a bit better on the second workout that had more core and balancing postures.If you are bored with your workouts and want to try something new, this is a fun one to try-the only thing you need is a sticky (yoga) mat and you are on your way. I would rate this as an intermediate workout, with a couple more advanced poses (crow, wheel) thrown in toward the end. If you are not up to the more advanced poses, you can take this to a strictly beginner level by following the person to the right that is modifying the moves, or the person to the left if you are looking to take it up a notch.All in all, a good workout~",4,"Use this as a workout, not as a yoga practice....",1271548800,"04 18, 2010",2010,1988,"['enjoy', 'variety', 'Jillian', 'bootcamp', 'style', 'workouts', 'pilates', 'dance', 'yes', 'yoga', 'Now', 'are', 'looking', 'complete', 'mind/body', 'yoga', 'muscles', 'calms', 'mind', 'not', 'yoga', 'bootcamp', 'Jillian', 'classic', 'poses', 'downward', 'dog', 'camel', 'triangle', 'boat', 'warrior', 'like', 'reps', 'out', 'meaning', 'repetitions', 'then', 'poses', 'about', '15', 'seconds', 'more', 'cardio', 'moves', 'then', 'strength', 'having', 'hold', 'pose.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'calm', 'zen-like', 'yoga', 'practice-truly', 'are', 'buying', 'Jillian', 'zen-line', 'persona', 'know', 'going', 'work', 'drop', 'have', 'plenty', 'dvds', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'Brian', 'Kest', 'Erich', 'Schiffman', 'Alan', 'Finger', 'do', 'more', 'traditional', 'practice', 'Jillian', 'expect', 'be', 'box', 'kick', 'butt', 'make', 'challenging', 'thought', 'was', 'fun', 'use', 'basic', 'yoga', 'poses', 'build', 'more', 'powerful', 'cardio', 'workout', 'yoga', 'purists', 'absolutely', 'not', 'fun', 'different', 'kind', 'work', 'arms', 'core', 'butt', 'legs', 'Absolutely.The', 'dvd', 'two', 'workouts-level', 'one', 'level', 'two', 'are', 'little', '30', 'minutes', 'long', 'Level', 'one', 'supposed', 'be', 'easier', 'two', 'workouts', 'find', 'plank', 'positions', 'be', 'more', 'challenging', 'did', 'bit', 'better', 'second', 'workout', 'had', 'more', 'core', 'balancing', 'postures.If', 'are', 'bored', 'workouts', 'want', 'try', 'something', 'new', 'fun', 'one', 'try-the', 'only', 'thing', 'need', 'sticky', 'yoga', 'mat', 'are', 'way', 'would', 'rate', 'intermediate', 'workout', 'couple', 'more', 'advanced', 'poses', 'crow', 'wheel', 'thrown', 'end', 'are', 'not', 'more', 'advanced', 'poses', 'can', 'take', 'strictly', 'beginner', 'level', 'following', 'person', 'right', 'modifying', 'moves', 'person', 'left', 'are', 'looking', 'take', 'up', 'notch.All', 'good', 'workout~']",N/A

But in Yoga Meltdown Jillian misses the mark.  After using quite a few of her other videos, I've gotten to know her on-screen persona fairly well.  Compared to those other videos, it seems as if Jillian didn't particularly like making Yoga Meltdown.  She is frown-y, slightly grouchy, and has no enthusiasm for the yoga workout.  I'm guessing that since yoga is currently popular, her team told her that she needed to make a yoga video, so she did.  But her heart clearly wasn't in it.  So it is difficult, while doing the video, to have any enthusiasm for the workout when the instructor doesn't.As for the yoga itself, well, it isn't.  Yoga, that is.  I wasn't expecting strictly traditional yoga.  This is Jillian, after all.  But this workout can be called yoga only with the very most tenuous of connections.

Having done all sorts of yoga dvds over the past 10 years (Rodney, Kristin McGee, Tara Stiles, Rainbeau Mars...) I can say that this is indeed yoga.  The difference is that there are no mountain scenes, flutes playing in the background, etc.  This is yoga aimed at fitness and it accomplishes what it sets out to do.  You are still doing sun salutations and connecting movement with breath.  Yes,  Jillian is a bit more aggressive in her instructions, but I enjoy her approach.  She readily admits that yoga is fairly new to her.  Since starting this dvd a month ago, I find that I am able to hold poses that I had never been able to do before (Crow for 15 seconds).  I also like the 30 minute time length.  An hour is just too long sometimes and 20 minutes of slow-paced yoga often feels like a waste of time.

1318135,A31V9NOMBWPFWS,B0031XYLWG,Imara219,"[1, 1]","I bought the Jillian Michaels 4-pack DVD set to begin my workout journey years ago. I was grossly out of shape but integrated Yoga Meltdown into my workout schedule. As a beginner it was a good workout. I got the gist of yoga through the workout, but I could tell this wasn't true yoga but Jillian's interpretation. It is similar to Flow Yoga using Power Yoga moves. Flow or power yoga is used for ""weight loss"" purposes because the moves are quicker so you build up aerobic sweat but the power moves encourages you to put all your body weight and strength into a pose. After a year, and lots of weight loss from different DVD sets, I moved on to Turbo Fire. Turbo Fire has a yoga dvd, and I fell in love with real yoga, leading me to Crunch Yoga Body Sculpt and now Ultimate Yogi. I feel that Jillian is the perfect gateway for you to decide the next step in your Yoga journey.If you are intermediate or advanced and into true Yoga, then this is not the DVD for you. If you want a yoga DVD to feel like weight loss program minus the true Yoga principals then this is the perfect DVD. The set is broken into 2 30 minute workouts-- Level 1 and Level 2. There are two other people on the DVD to do the easy and advance version of the moves. You won't hold moves for too long but at the time I did enjoy the flow and workout especially as a beginner.ETA: When searching for yoga workouts, a person has to know if they want yoga practice with true principals of meditation and relaxation incorporated or not. There are several different types of yoga-- from flow/power to kundalini. You will be happiest if you know what you would like from a practice and decide on the level from there. I feel as if this dvd is an awesome starting point because the moves are there and the presentation of yoga is familar-style.",4,Can satisfy beginners and Jillian fans,1374796800,"07 26, 2013",2013,1809,"['bought', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', '4-pack', 'DVD', 'set', 'begin', 'journey', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'grossly', 'shape', 'integrated', 'Yoga', 'Meltdown', 'workout', 'schedule', 'beginner', 'was', 'good', 'workout', 'got', 'gist', 'yoga', 'workout', 'could', 'tell', 'was', ""n't"", 'true', 'yoga', 'Jillian', 'interpretation', 'similar', 'Flow', 'Yoga', 'using', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'Flow', 'power', 'yoga', 'used', 'weight', 'loss', 'purposes', 'moves', 'are', 'quicker', 'so', 'build', 'up', 'aerobic', 'sweat', 'power', 'moves', 'put', 'body', 'weight', 'strength', 'pose', 'year', 'lots', 'weight', 'loss', 'different', 'DVD', 'sets', 'moved', 'Turbo', 'Fire', 'Turbo', 'Fire', 'yoga', 'dvd', 'fell', 'love', 'real', 'yoga', 'leading', 'Crunch', 'Yoga', 'Body', 'Sculpt', 'now', 'Ultimate', 'Yogi', 'feel', 'Jillian', 'perfect', 'gateway', 'decide', 'next', 'step', 'Yoga', 'journey.If', 'are', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'true', 'Yoga', 'then', 'not', 'DVD', 'want', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'feel', 'weight', 'loss', 'program', 'true', 'Yoga', 'principals', 'then', 'perfect', 'DVD', 'set', 'broken', '2', '30', 'minute', 'workouts', 'Level', '1', 'Level', '2', 'are', 'two', 'other', 'people', 'DVD', 'do', 'easy', 'advance', 'version', 'moves', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hold', 'moves', 'too', 'long', 'time', 'did', 'enjoy', 'flow', 'workout', 'especially', 'beginner.ETA', 'When', 'searching', 'yoga', 'workouts', 'person', 'know', 'want', 'yoga', 'practice', 'true', 'principals', 'meditation', 'relaxation', 'incorporated', 'not', 'are', 'several', 'different', 'types', 'yoga', 'flow/power', 'kundalini', 'will', 'be', 'happiest', 'know', 'what', 'would', 'like', 'practice', 'decide', 'level', 'there', 'feel', 'dvd', 'awesome', 'starting', 'point', 'moves', 'are', 'there', 'presentation', 'yoga', 'familar-style']",N/A

I should have known better when I bought the DVD, but I really liked everything she did so I thought I give it a try. Big waste of money. Maybe it's ok for people who have never done yoga before in their lives and who want a variation on daily training, but it's definitely not for those who actually want to do yoga.

If you have used 30 Day Shred, Banish Fat, and/or No More Trouble Zones, don't really expect the same thing.  Jillian still does have her great, encouraging, down-to-business attitude.  There are no real circuits in this video, which I was totally prepared for; she mentions circuits once, but it's nothing like the other clear-cut 6 minutes... 5 moves, repeat each move twice (if you're familiar with Jillian, you know what I'm talking about) I also just have to comment on how pretty she looks in this DVD :) No, but seriously, I love Jillian to death, but my kid says she looks ""manly"" in her other videos, but even my kid said... she looks less mean and manly in this video.This video is comprised of 2 30 minute workouts.  The first one is the reccomended starter and is a little easier than level 2.  I was able to keep up with most of the advanced in Level 1, but was dying in Level 2!  I could not do the move where you put your elbows on your knees and balance.  I was surprised because I am in good shape, but I have never done much yoga at all.  My balance is lacking, so I'm hoping that by incorporating this video into my routine, I'll improve. Jillian tells you not to be intimidated, she wanted to give you something to work towards.  You can expect to see two gals in the background... one doing advanced and one doing beginner modifications.  As always, the advanced demonstrater makes me writhe with envy.I can't comment much on the technical yoga aspects because as I said, I'm pretty new to it, but don't expect somethig slow moving here.  She has taken traditional yoga poses and added movement.  You know it wouldn't be Jillian without a little cardio and elevated heart rate, but it's nothing like the heart rates you feel in her other DVDs. She calls it ""rep it out.""  Then you hold the poses for 15 seconds at the end.  Some of these feel like MUCH longer than 15 seconds!  There are a few Sun Salutations mixed in there, which I was familiar with.  There is a nice warm up and cool down included, but the cool down in mainly for the lower body, hips and back.  Make sure you do your own thing if you feel the need to stretch out your arms, chest, neck, etc.Overall, I was happy with this.  I think I just have to ""get comfortable with being uncomfortable"" as Jillan says.  I'm glad I tried something new and can fit it into my rotation.  It's something for me to work towards :)  If you like Jillian, go for it.  If you're not sure and you want a unique workout with an encouraging, no BS instructor, then go for it too!

I picked Yoga Meltdown because I became a huge Jillian Michaels fan after purchasingJillian Michaels: No More Trouble Zones.  Since I love a good workout, AND I love yoga, I thought: ""I can't go wrong with this video!""Well, it turned out to be the craziest exercise situation I've ever been in.  I never dreamed I would EVER hear the words: ""Who's your daddy!!?"" being shouted at me during a yoga session! In fact, I never got through it the first time because I spent most of the time on the floor laughing! Still, since I already have an extensive yoga library (full of ""serious"" yoga), I welcome this addition and will likely use it as a warm-up before doing another yoga video.If you are a die-hard yoga fundamentalist DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!! I promise you that if you are a hard-core purist, you will see this video as nothing less than profane.  When you see how Jillian has done things like turning Upward Bow into a set of inverted push-ups you'll be scandalized and outraged.  Spare yourself the coronary and just look elsewhere:Power Yoga - Total Body Workout.If you are brand-new to yoga DO NOT BUY THIS ONE, because you WILL NOT know how to make the repetitions safe for your knees and wrists.  The problem is not the type of poses (they are all basic), but in order to do reps, even with basic poses, it is IMPERATIVE that you are fully competent with proper alignment.  Otherwise you are likely to hurt yourself. TryRodney Yee's Yoga for Beginnersinstead.To experienced Yogis and Yoginis who (like myself) have a sense of humor and enjoy a good work out: you may really like this one! Yes, it's pretty far out there on the edge of the yoga continuum, but so what!? Once you can do the routine (without collapsing into helpless giggling) you will find that this is a very challening workout that will make you sweat. I would recommend that you make the workout what you want it to be (modify to make transitions more graceful, or simply to guard your joints).Jillian herself is pretty hilarious during this video, too.  You will see her in a new light, which may endear her to you a little, since even SHE can't do some of the poses! In fact, I think she actually FELL OVER during Standing Head-to-Knee pose, because just as she's losing her balance the camera shoots over to one of her assistants.  The camera then STAYS on the assistant, until Jillian finally comes walking over to ""coach"" her.  It's a total SCREAM!I imagine that Jillian must have gotten talked into making this video before she was ready (though, for the most part she does demonstrate proper alignment).  At any rate, she definitely gets an A for effort. And she even seems humbled by the experience, stating several times throughout the workout: ""it's not about being perfect, but about being perfect in your imperfection.""

It takes standard yoga poses and adds repetitions to the movement.  What's really smart about it is three things:1.)  The repetitions are movements that don't put a lot of pressure on major joints--you're not moving through the joints in such a way that there is a lot of force, so this isn't likely to cause injury.  Specifically, what you're not doing, is rolling through shoulder joints repeatedly, with all your weight on your shoulders, as in most Ashtanga yoga--which does tend to cause injuries.2.)  It's interval training.  What that means is that your heart rate goes up and down a lot.  Your body, in response, will default to a higher level of calorie burning and oxygen use, so this is a pretty good way to increase metabolism and what we think of as ""lung capacity.""3.)  It's difficult enough that you don't feel like you're wasting your time.  Each workout is only 30 minutes, but it's difficult enough that, if your goal that day is fitness, you're definitely getting your money's worth.Some negatives:  it's filmed on a really bright gym set, which is a little difficult to watch;  Jillian doesn't actually do all the poses; sometimes it's hard to see the beginner model when you need to.Who this is for:  experienced yoga folks who want a different kind of more athletic short practice;  anyone wanting to add gym-based yoga to their workouts.Who this is not for:  if you have bad wrists, this might be undoable.  Your knees also should be good enough to get up and down from the floor without difficulty.However, this is a fairly safe, more difficult yoga dvd.Yogi Eric Schiffman has been quoted as saying, ""The point with yoga, is to do it a lot.""

Usually you can find me with the Rodney Yee or Shiva Rea DVD, or doing yoga at work.  I'm no yogi - I've never done a handstand or had more than 2 limbs off the ground at any one time.  But I do love to do yoga - it makes me feel so relaxed, strong, flexible and of all the workouts I do, it's the only one that has never hurt me.  I'm also a huge fan of Jillian Michaels.  I love her attitude.  I love to watch Biggest Loser.  And I've been using 30  Day  Shred for two years now, off and on (alas, I keep straining/pulling/hurting various things if I do that every day).So, take two things I love - Jillian Michaels and Yoga - and put them together?  Well, it's like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup (only healthier).  On Jillian's new DVD, she offers two 30-minute workouts, one to start out with and one to advance to.  Like her other DVDs, each workout offers both a beginner and advanced exerciser to follow  besides Jillian, who cues the movements and points out the correct alignment on her demonstrators.Jillian's yoga workout is quite strenuous, as it takes poses and turns them into strength-training exercises.  For example, she will take a Warrior II and make it into a lunge sequence so that you are going in and out of the bent knee.  Then you hold that pose.  I have mainly worked with the first workout, and it is structured into three segments, plus a warmup and cooldown.  Each segment consists of 3 poses, done as described above, followed by a sun salutation flow.Jillian knows how to properly describe the movements and she makes it accessible to a non-yoga person (or so I would think).  She uses more sports/fitness terminology.  In fact, it sounds a bit funny when she tries to use yoga terminology, and she even jokes about that.  I think this video will put some people at ease who may have been afraid of yoga.  And people who didn't want to do  yoga because they thought it didn't burn calories?  They may enjoy this video as it's bit more uptempo than your average video, Bryan Kest aside.This one is a keeper!",5,Yoga Meltdown is awesome.,1273363200,"05 9, 2010",2010,2134,"['little', 'background', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'yoga', 'not-so-serious', 'fashion', 'ten', 'years', 'now', 'Usually', 'can', 'find', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'DVD', 'doing', 'yoga', 'work', ""'m"", 'yogi', ""'ve"", 'never', 'done', 'handstand', 'had', 'more', '2', 'limbs', 'ground', 'one', 'time', 'do', 'love', 'do', 'yoga', 'feel', 'so', 'relaxed', 'strong', 'flexible', 'workouts', 'do', 'only', 'one', 'never', 'hurt', ""'m"", 'also', 'huge', 'fan', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'love', 'attitude', 'love', 'watch', 'Biggest', 'Loser', ""'ve"", 'been', 'using', '30', 'Day', 'Shred', 'two', 'years', 'now', 'off', 'alas', 'keep', 'straining/pulling/hurting', 'various', 'things', 'do', 'day', '.So', 'take', 'two', 'things', 'love', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'Yoga', 'put', 'together', 'Well', 'Reese', 'Peanut', 'Butter', 'Cup', 'only', 'healthier', 'Jillian', 'new', 'DVD', 'two', '30-minute', 'workouts', 'one', 'start', 'out', 'one', 'advance', 'other', 'DVDs', 'workout', 'beginner', 'advanced', 'exerciser', 'follow', 'besides', 'Jillian', 'who', 'movements', 'points', 'out', 'correct', 'alignment', 'demonstrators.Jillian', 'yoga', 'workout', 'quite', 'strenuous', 'poses', 'strength-training', 'exercises', 'example', 'will', 'take', 'Warrior', 'II', 'make', 'lunge', 'sequence', 'are', 'going', 'bent', 'knee', 'Then', 'hold', 'pose', 'have', 'mainly', 'worked', 'first', 'workout', 'structured', 'three', 'segments', 'warmup', 'cooldown', 'segment', '3', 'poses', 'done', 'described', 'followed', 'sun', 'salutation', 'flow.Jillian', 'how', 'properly', 'describe', 'movements', 'accessible', 'non-yoga', 'person', 'so', 'would', 'think', 'more', 'sports/fitness', 'terminology', 'fact', 'bit', 'funny', 'when', 'use', 'yoga', 'terminology', 'even', 'jokes', 'think', 'video', 'will', 'put', 'people', 'ease', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'afraid', 'yoga', 'people', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'yoga', 'thought', 'did', ""n't"", 'burn', 'calories', 'may', 'enjoy', 'video', 'bit', 'more', 'uptempo', 'average', 'video', 'Bryan', 'Kest', 'one', 'keeper']",N/A

I did workout one the day after Christmas and thoroughly enjoyed it. The thirty minutes goes by fast and you aren't constantly looking at the clock, hoping the workout was over. You learn the yoga poses, but Jillian implements them in repetitions where you are constantly getting cardio in as well. In regular yoga, you hold the pose and don't have much movement... don't get me wrong, yoga is excellent for your body, but with Jillian's I don't lose interest and get bored.

However, I am NOT new to Jillian, I own 9 of her dvd's and love them all...this one I have to say though missed the mark and is my absolute least favorite of hers.Mainly, because I feel like the &#34;Meltdown&#34; part is false advertising.  There is nothing about this workout that is fast paced or gets your heart rate up very much or even makes you sweat more than a drop or 2!  Very much unlike anything she's done.  Although, to be fair, it does seem like from what I've learned, that yoga is not about getting your HR up or sweating, it's more about flexibility and strength and relaxing.  So, while this is my least favorite, I do pull it out now and again on a day I maybe wouldn't have otherwise worked out, or on a day I had a short run.  I do appreciate working muscles at a slower pace, however to be honest, I've gotten so used to her &#34;high octane&#34; workouts, I've come to expect and enjoy them and that is what I was looking for!  If I'm putting in a half hour or hour, I'd like to get the most calories burned for that time as possible and this here falls short.As far as instruction goes, she does a good job at explaining the poses I feel, I'm not sure how &#34;true&#34; they are to yoga since as I said I am new, but I appreciate what she was trying to do.  Also, when I do this I usually do both levels, that way at least I am burning more for 60 mins!If you are looking for something that is more traditional Jillian, I'd say you may want to pass on this.

I'm a fitness junkie and have done just about every type of fitness program there is in gyms and at home. I own dozens and dozens of fitness dvds. I've done yoga off and on through the years, but have not practiced it enough to be nearly an authority. I initially tried yoga many years ago because I was impressed by pictures of so called yoga bodies in various magazines, but I was never able to find a program that seemed to be the right fit for me. Many of them had their benefits and I enjoyed them, but they were either too slow paced or involved poses that I couldn't master. Quite frankly I've never really wanted to do a head stand, but I did want some of the other benefits that come from the practice.I was never a big Jillian fan (haven't done any of her programs) and was reluctant to give Yoga Meltdown a try. I enjoy lifting heavy weights and high intensity cardio, but every so often my interests change and I want to try something different. In the last several years I've begun to learn about the benefits of strictly body weight training but it's hard to find a variety of dvds that focus on this and present a challenge. I wanted something that worked my muscles more deeply but still left me feeling like I had good workout. This one caught my eye, I was impressed by the brief video so I went for it.I was pleasantly surprised from the start. I began with the level 1 just to get a feel for it and worked up a good sweat. It was paced just fast enough and presented enough body weight resistance to make me feel like it was worthwhile. The repetitive movements in some of the traditional yoga poses gave my muscles quite a workout. To me that's what had been missing from some of the more traditional yoga programs that I've done. We moved through the poses and though my body was obviously challenged I didn't feel like I was working towards that ""yoga body"", it was more just deep stretching. I understand the obvious mental benefits of doing yoga and other types of exercise and I appreciate them, but for me the primary focus is maintaining a high level of physical fitness. This program presented just the right mix of using your own body resistance to build strength and to sculpt and give your muscles a deep stretch.This program may not be for everyone for as others have stated if you are a yoga purist you won't enjoy it. There is no soothing music or chanting or calming voices with words of wisdom. But if you want more of an athletic yoga program this might work for you. I believe it will be a nice addition to my workout library. I only gave it 4 stars because after doing it I wished that it could have been 45 minutes instead of 30.",4,Pleasantly Surprised,1288569600,"11 1, 2010",2010,2790,"[""'ve"", 'ordered', 'many', 'products', 'Amazon', 'rarely', 'do', 'write', 'review', 'However', 'felt', 'need', 'comment', 'one', ""'m"", 'fitness', 'junkie', 'have', 'done', 'just', 'type', 'fitness', 'program', 'gyms', 'home', 'own', 'dozens', 'dozens', 'fitness', 'dvds', ""'ve"", 'done', 'yoga', 'off', 'years', 'have', 'not', 'practiced', 'enough', 'be', 'nearly', 'authority', 'initially', 'tried', 'yoga', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'impressed', 'pictures', 'so', 'called', 'yoga', 'bodies', 'various', 'magazines', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'find', 'program', 'seemed', 'be', 'right', 'fit', 'Many', 'had', 'benefits', 'enjoyed', 'were', 'either', 'too', 'slow', 'paced', 'involved', 'poses', 'could', ""n't"", 'master', 'Quite', 'frankly', ""'ve"", 'never', 'really', 'wanted', 'do', 'head', 'stand', 'did', 'want', 'other', 'benefits', 'come', 'practice.I', 'was', 'never', 'big', 'Jillian', 'fan', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'programs', 'was', 'reluctant', 'give', 'Yoga', 'Meltdown', 'try', 'enjoy', 'lifting', 'heavy', 'weights', 'high', 'intensity', 'cardio', 'so', 'often', 'interests', 'change', 'want', 'try', 'something', 'different', 'last', 'several', 'years', ""'ve"", 'begun', 'learn', 'benefits', 'strictly', 'body', 'weight', 'training', 'hard', 'find', 'variety', 'dvds', 'focus', 'present', 'challenge', 'wanted', 'something', 'worked', 'muscles', 'more', 'deeply', 'still', 'left', 'feeling', 'had', 'good', 'workout', 'one', 'caught', 'eye', 'was', 'impressed', 'brief', 'video', 'so', 'went', 'it.I', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'start', 'began', 'level', '1', 'just', 'get', 'feel', 'worked', 'up', 'good', 'sweat', 'was', 'paced', 'just', 'fast', 'enough', 'presented', 'enough', 'body', 'weight', 'resistance', 'make', 'feel', 'was', 'worthwhile', 'repetitive', 'movements', 'traditional', 'yoga', 'poses', 'gave', 'muscles', 'quite', 'workout', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'missing', 'more', 'traditional', 'yoga', 'programs', ""'ve"", 'done', 'moved', 'poses', 'body', 'was', 'obviously', 'challenged', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'working', 'towards', 'yoga', 'body', 'was', 'more', 'just', 'deep', 'stretching', 'understand', 'obvious', 'mental', 'benefits', 'doing', 'yoga', 'other', 'types', 'exercise', 'appreciate', 'primary', 'focus', 'maintaining', 'high', 'level', 'physical', 'fitness', 'program', 'presented', 'just', 'right', 'mix', 'using', 'own', 'body', 'resistance', 'build', 'strength', 'sculpt', 'give', 'muscles', 'deep', 'stretch.This', 'program', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'others', 'have', 'stated', 'are', 'yoga', 'purist', 'wo', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'soothing', 'music', 'chanting', 'calming', 'voices', 'words', 'wisdom', 'want', 'more', 'athletic', 'yoga', 'program', 'might', 'work', 'believe', 'will', 'be', 'nice', 'addition', 'workout', 'library', 'only', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'because', 'doing', 'wished', 'could', 'have', 'been', '45', 'minutes', 'instead', '30']",N/A
