1026017,A2OZBJ58CML9OS,B000JBXY44,A. Gammill,"[1, 1]","Having re-lived many shows from my childhood via DVD in the past few years, I've learned to approach new releases with some trepidation.  The harsh reality of growing up (for me, anyway) is that sometimes nostalgic feelings for a show don't always overcome its now-obvious deficits.  I'm happy to say that, for the most part, this is not the case with Dungeons and Dragons.The stories are. . .well, not quite ADULT, but a little better developed than most ""kids"" shows.  The excellent voice cast lends credibility to the characters.  You really care about what happens next to those kids.My only real complaint with the show itself is the shockingly limited animation.  The world of D & D is populated by all sorts of fantastic creatures and worlds, most of which are well-drawn.  But the movement, even in action-packed scenes, is pretty static.Now, the DVD presentation is first-class.  There's a well-made documentary detailing the making of the series, a few commentary tracks, and ""Uni's Fun Facts,"" a text-only trivia section for each episode.  The mini D & D manual will be of interest to anyone who's ever played the Dungeons & Dragons game.If you are able to overlook some minor shortcomings, this is certainly a fine purchase for fans of the show.",4,Better than the average nostalgia trip,1166659200,"12 21, 2006",2006,1257,"['Having', 're-lived', 'many', 'shows', 'childhood', 'DVD', 'past', 'few', 'years', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'approach', 'new', 'releases', 'trepidation', 'harsh', 'reality', 'growing', 'up', 'anyway', 'sometimes', 'nostalgic', 'feelings', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'overcome', 'now-obvious', 'deficits', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'most', 'part', 'not', 'case', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons.The', 'stories', 'are', '.well', 'not', 'quite', 'ADULT', 'little', 'better', 'developed', 'most', 'kids', 'shows', 'excellent', 'voice', 'cast', 'lends', 'credibility', 'characters', 'really', 'care', 'what', 'next', 'kids.My', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'show', 'shockingly', 'limited', 'animation', 'world', 'D', 'D', 'populated', 'sorts', 'fantastic', 'creatures', 'worlds', 'most', 'are', 'well-drawn', 'movement', 'even', 'action-packed', 'scenes', 'pretty', 'static.Now', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'first-class', 'well-made', 'documentary', 'detailing', 'making', 'series', 'few', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'Uni', 'Fun', 'Facts', 'text-only', 'trivia', 'section', 'episode', 'mini', 'D', 'D', 'manual', 'will', 'be', 'interest', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'played', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'game.If', 'are', 'able', 'overlook', 'minor', 'shortcomings', 'certainly', 'fine', 'purchase', 'fans', 'show']",Dungeons & Dragons - The Complete Animated Series

Unlike so much stuff that seemed awesome when I was a kid but disappointing to me as an adult (""Goonies"" flick, I'm talking to you!), this cartoon is still a lot of fun. We've watched all the episodes together and are looking forward to watching them with our sons when they're bigger.Granted, the animation definitely isn't up to today's standards -- though it wasn't bad for the '80s -- and sometimes the humor is kind of cheesy. But the show is still really unique and entertaining. I'm surprised how many things from this series I remembered even 25 years later!I've noticed other reviewers have had some issues with the booklet falling apart of scratches on the discs. I'm happy to say we haven't encountered those problems.

1026024,A1T8N18XKDLJO4,B000JBXY44,B. Aikens,"[3, 4]","When i came across this in a local store a while back i instantly had to have it. I have fond memories of this show as being one of the only real fantasy cartoons on tv...along with He-man which was a pretty cheesy show to begin with. So being a dnd gm (at least when we all find a time to play) and an old fan of the show i bought it instantly. The series is filled with many extras as well as a handbook with a short adventure using the characters from the series. This would be a good starting point for a younger player and would be a good intro to how dnd works (or worked since 4e is unfortunately on the horizon). The book wasn't put together very well as the pages where very loose and after my initial read through i put it back in the box and haven't taken it out since. So when i got home i loaded disc one and was instantly filled with nostalgia and watched every episode on the first couple of discs in one sitting. Something weird happened as i watched these discs and the nostalgia started to fade. The cartoons are cheesy and in some spots over the top cheesy but they do have some decent episodes with decent quests in them and i have actually been able to steal a few ideas for my campaigns from them believe it or not. Overall though i guess it just comes down to the fact that the things i loved while growing up are not the things i like now and the cheesy stories and animation of these cartoons aren't up to the standard that i set for my own viewing. Don't get me wrong i think this is a good package and the cartoons are watchable and when i have kids they will probably enjoy them but overall i just didn't enjoy them that much. So in closing if you have fond memories of the show but aren't into 80's animation very much these days i would say pass on these and remember them being as great as they were not as lame as they are. However, if you are into 80's animation these are some of the best cartoons from the era and they still beat the crap out of anything that is on for kids these days even if the animation is really dated.",3,DnD the animated series - not quite what i remembered,1195430400,"11 19, 2007",2007,2059,"['When', 'i', 'came', 'local', 'store', 'back', 'i', 'instantly', 'had', 'have', 'have', 'fond', 'memories', 'show', 'being', 'one', 'only', 'real', 'fantasy', 'cartoons', 'tv', 'He-man', 'was', 'pretty', 'cheesy', 'show', 'begin', 'So', 'being', 'dnd', 'gm', 'least', 'when', 'find', 'time', 'play', 'old', 'fan', 'show', 'i', 'bought', 'instantly', 'series', 'filled', 'many', 'extras', 'as', 'well', 'handbook', 'short', 'adventure', 'using', 'characters', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'starting', 'point', 'younger', 'player', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'intro', 'how', 'dnd', 'worked', '4e', 'unfortunately', 'horizon', 'book', 'was', ""n't"", 'put', 'together', 'very', 'well', 'pages', 'where', 'very', 'loose', 'initial', 'read', 'i', 'put', 'back', 'box', 'have', ""n't"", 'taken', 'out', 'when', 'i', 'got', 'home', 'i', 'loaded', 'disc', 'one', 'was', 'instantly', 'filled', 'nostalgia', 'watched', 'episode', 'first', 'couple', 'discs', 'one', 'sitting', 'Something', 'weird', 'happened', 'i', 'watched', 'discs', 'nostalgia', 'started', 'fade', 'cartoons', 'are', 'cheesy', 'spots', 'top', 'cheesy', 'do', 'have', 'decent', 'episodes', 'decent', 'quests', 'i', 'have', 'actually', 'been', 'able', 'steal', 'few', 'ideas', 'campaigns', 'believe', 'not', 'Overall', 'i', 'guess', 'just', 'down', 'fact', 'things', 'i', 'loved', 'growing', 'up', 'are', 'not', 'things', 'i', 'now', 'cheesy', 'stories', 'animation', 'cartoons', 'are', ""n't"", 'up', 'standard', 'i', 'set', 'own', 'viewing', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'i', 'think', 'good', 'package', 'cartoons', 'are', 'watchable', 'when', 'i', 'have', 'kids', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'overall', 'i', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'that', 'much', 'So', 'closing', 'have', 'fond', 'memories', 'show', 'are', ""n't"", '80', 'animation', 'very', 'much', 'days', 'i', 'would', 'say', 'pass', 'remember', 'being', 'as', 'great', 'were', 'not', 'as', 'lame', 'are', 'However', 'are', '80', 'animation', 'are', 'best', 'cartoons', 'era', 'still', 'beat', 'crap', 'anything', 'kids', 'days', 'even', 'animation', 'really', 'dated']",Dungeons & Dragons - The Complete Animated Series

The premise is that Dungeon Master gives them a riddle and in solving it they hope they will get home.",4,The better version of an old favorate,1285718400,"09 29, 2010",2010,1932,"['had', 'fortune', 'getting', 'BCI', 'version', '2006', 'can', 'make', 'sure', 'are', 'getting', 'version', 'rather', 'later', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'Entertainment', '2009', 'version', 'BCI', 'version', 'addition', 'DVDs', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'fold', 'out', 'plastic', 'holding', 'case', 'Animated', 'Series', 'Handbook', 'mini', 'module', 'then', 'current', 'D', 'D', '3.x', 'system', 'episode', 'guide', 'outlining', 'episode', 'including', 'extras', 'DVDs', 'are', 'LOT', 'extras', 'BCI', 'set', '.The', 'extras', 'order', 'are', 'presented', 'Episode', 'Guide', 'are', '*', '32', 'minute', 'documentary', 'featuring', 'interviews', 'show', 'production', 'team', 'writers', 'animators', 'network', 'executives*', 'Two', 'episodes', 'Night', 'No', 'Tomorrow', 'Dragon', 'Graveyard', 'commentary', 'tracts*', 'Full', 'length', 'animated', 'storyboard', 'interactive', 'episodes', 'comparison', 'Girl', 'Who', 'Dreamed', 'Tomorrow', '*', 'D', 'D', 'interactive', 'adventure*', '50', 'detailed', 'characters', 'creatures', 'artifacts', 'pictures', 'clips', 'bios*', 'Short', 'live', 'action', 'fan', 'film*', 'Trivia*', 'Gallery', 'original', 'models', 'sheet', 'memorabilia*', 'Radio', 'dramatization', 'final', 'unaired', 'episode', 'Requiem', '*', 'Alternative', 'rare', 'footage*', 'DVD-ROM', 'scripts', 'development', 'bible', 'storyboards*', 'Ink', 'Paint', 'TrailersFor', 'people', 'unfamiliar', 'premise', 'six', 'children', 'are', 'catapulted', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'world', 'called', 'Realm', 'riding', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'rollercoaster', 'are', 'given', 'magical', 'weapons', 'role', 'names', 'guide', 'Dungeon', 'Master', 'meeting', 'Tiamat.Part', 'charm', 'series', 'three', 'character', 'roles', 'are', 'exact', 'opposite', 'actual', 'personalities', 'coward', 'made', 'Cavalier', 'youngest', 'made', 'Barbarian', 'stereotypical', 'science', 'nerd', 'made', 'Magician', 'who', 'always', 'worse', 'luck', 'getting', 'what', 'magical', 'hat', 'premise', 'Dungeon', 'Master', 'riddle', 'solving', 'hope', 'will', 'get', 'home']",Dungeons & Dragons - The Complete Animated Series

I had recorded a few of my favorite episodes to VHS and watched them repeatedly, but one episode was missing - The Dragon's Graveyard, in my opinion, the best of the entire series.I'm glad the DVD set finally came out, but as another reviewer pointed out, some of the newer music pieces of Season 2 were replaced with the older music from Season 1.  This changes the experience in a significant way for me, so in that, this release is disappointing.  This certainly isn't the first time I've acquired a DVD release of an old favorite to have its music or editing changed.  The nostalgia of the ""first time wow"" is ripped away when they don't remain faithful to the way it originally appeared on TV.  So, sadly, this isn't the same Dragon's Graveyard I watched in awe so long ago.  Frankly, some of the music in the episode seems out of place.  The intensity of the episode really demanded the music originally scored for it.  It's strange that the music was changed for the DVDs though, since its recent syndication to the Disney channel retained the original music - but the DVDs don't have the small edits present in the currently aired versions.One other problem I noticed is that in a couple of the episodes (Prison Without Walls being one of them), the audio is about a half-second off from the video.Those problems aside, this really is a complete release.  I believe some of the episodes may have even been cleaned up and reanimated to generate the DVDs (this is especially true of Night of No Tomorrow, episode #1), but some blemishing is apparent on black backgrounds.  The booklet has nice renditions of the characters inside as well.Episodes to watch for: Night of No Tomorrow (any episode with an extended presence of Tiamat is cool), The Box, Quest of the Skeleton Warrior, Treasure of Tardos, Dragon's Graveyard, Dungeon at the Heart of Dawn",4,"All episodes are here, but some music is different",1165881600,"12 12, 2006",2006,1929,"['was', 'avid', 'watcher', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'TV', 'back', '80', 'had', 'recorded', 'few', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'VHS', 'watched', 'repeatedly', 'one', 'episode', 'was', 'missing', 'Dragon', 'Graveyard', 'opinion', 'best', 'entire', 'series.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'DVD', 'set', 'finally', 'came', 'out', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'newer', 'music', 'pieces', 'Season', '2', 'were', 'replaced', 'older', 'music', 'Season', '1', 'experience', 'significant', 'way', 'so', 'release', 'disappointing', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'acquired', 'DVD', 'release', 'old', 'favorite', 'have', 'music', 'editing', 'changed', 'nostalgia', 'first', 'time', 'wow', 'ripped', 'away', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'remain', 'faithful', 'way', 'originally', 'appeared', 'TV', 'So', 'sadly', ""n't"", 'same', 'Dragon', 'Graveyard', 'watched', 'awe', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'Frankly', 'music', 'episode', 'place', 'intensity', 'episode', 'really', 'demanded', 'music', 'originally', 'scored', 'strange', 'music', 'was', 'changed', 'DVDs', 'recent', 'syndication', 'Disney', 'channel', 'retained', 'original', 'music', 'DVDs', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'small', 'edits', 'present', 'currently', 'aired', 'versions.One', 'other', 'problem', 'noticed', 'couple', 'episodes', 'Prison', 'Without', 'Walls', 'being', 'one', 'audio', 'half-second', 'video.Those', 'problems', 'aside', 'really', 'complete', 'release', 'believe', 'episodes', 'may', 'have', 'even', 'been', 'cleaned', 'up', 'reanimated', 'generate', 'DVDs', 'especially', 'true', 'Night', 'No', 'Tomorrow', 'episode', '1', 'blemishing', 'apparent', 'black', 'backgrounds', 'booklet', 'nice', 'renditions', 'characters', 'as', 'well.Episodes', 'watch', 'Night', 'No', 'Tomorrow', 'episode', 'extended', 'presence', 'Tiamat', 'cool', 'Box', 'Quest', 'Skeleton', 'Warrior', 'Treasure', 'Tardos', 'Dragon', 'Graveyard', 'Dungeon', 'Heart', 'Dawn']",Dungeons & Dragons - The Complete Animated Series

We are both in our 30's, he had expressed interest in my copy when he saw mine. We both have a common interest of role-playing and the cartoons we grew up with, this qualifies as both. I apologize in advance for unrelated comparisons with other products I HAVE had difficulties with.The packaging, I had no problem with the DVD discs or the dual-layer (overlapping discs) digi-pak packaging. All discs were properly seated and easy enough to remove and not damaged in anyway. (Unlike Buck Rogers' digi-pak packaging which requires a crowbar and then a gentle touch as not to bend the discs in half!!)The mini-book, that comes with the set was however woefully ""bound"", at least in my copy. They expected the strength of one page to hold the entire book inside the cover with staples, not glue. While the damage to the booklet is minor as the staples just pulled through the page, basically leaving me with a cardboard slipcover and the guts of the book, all still very legible, just mildly disappointing as is any new product you received that comes with odd, random, non-performance related damage.The cartoons, were as entertaining as I remembered them and maybe even more so now from a D&D; nerd point-of-view. (Unlike Voltron(lions), the content was immature and so very painful! Do we really need EVERY commercial bumper? damn it!)

1026045,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B000JBXY44,Dorrie Wheeler,"[13, 16]","If you grew up in the 1980's, you surely remember Dungeons & Dragons. Before Halo, Final Fantasy and the other slew of console video games, kids played Dungeons and Dragons.  The actual board game looked pretty plain, but kids and teens all over the world were hooked on the role playing game in the 80s.  Dungeons & Dragons-The Animated Series premiered in 1983 and lasted a total of 27 episodes. Air dates range from 1983-1985.The complete series DVD is being released on DVD by Ink and Paint. In recent years they have released animated DVD sets for He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, She-Ra Princess of Power, and Prince Valiant among others.  The Dungeons & Dragons DVD box set is one of the most gorgeous sets they have released to date.Okay, I'll start with the basics.  All 27 episodes are presented on 5 individual discs which are housed inside of a gorgeous case inside of a nice box.  The art work on the cover of the case is a reproduction of the original promotion poster from 1983.  As pretty as it is, one of the bad parts is that the discs are housed in one of the cases where the discs sort of lie on top of each other, where one disc is slightly raised.  This sometimes causes discs to become loose in transit.  Two of my discs were loose in the box but undamaged.  Each disc includes artwork of one of the characters from the series.  The back of the box includes the Dungeons & Dragons World Map.Where Ink & Paint went above and beyond comes in the form of the Dungeons & Dragons Animated Series Handbook.  This hard cover book is included with the set.  As a reviewer who has reviewed well over 100 TV on DVD box sets, this is one of the nicest set guides I have come across. It's very detailed.  The guide to some on the surface may seem like just a book with profiles of the characters.  However, it's actually a guide with statistics and rules for playing the characters of the Dungeons & Dragon's cartoon.  The detailed guide includes everything you need to know about playing the adventure and the background.  There is a paper booklet insert that includes the episode guide.

1026052,ATJLR5VAS2QE5,B000JBXY44,Garrett Aja,"[50, 52]","The people at BCI Eclipse (and Andy Mangels in particular) have established themselves as masters at releasing cartoons on DVD with great care, no small feat given Filmation's reputation and the time-compressed PAL masters that Hallmark left behind before destroying everything else (or so the story goes). With Dungeons & Dragons, though, things were much more hopeful, just so long as the artificial commercial breaks, mystifying edits, and the awful new theme that Saban created for recent re-airings were absent.Naturally, Murphy's Law had to kick in, in the form of The Walt Disney Company.Nine episodes (every episode from ""City At The Edge Of Midnight"" until the finale, with the exception of ""The Traitor"", ""The Last Illusion"", and ""The Dungeon At The Heart Of Dawn""-one third of the show's 27 episodes, for those counting at home) have had three pieces of music-one ""oasis"" theme and two fast-paced, dramatic battle themes-replaced. All three were penned and conducted by Rob Walsh. To the experienced fan of the cartoons of Marvel and Sunbow, this replacement comes as a surprise, since Walsh's music was never removed from Rhino's Sunbow releases, where it is extremely prevalent, to the point of even totally supplanting that of Johnny Douglas.What makes this especially aggravating is that the UK DVDs were untouched, ""The Dungeon At The Heart Of Dawn"" (a Walsh-heavy episode) is untouched, and Disney has created new music that is really bad, a maddening choice considering that the majority of the missing cues have been replaced by the familiar music of Johnny Douglas (and other than in ""The Dragon's Graveyard"", where Walsh's music is vital, the change is not immediately recognizable). We don't deserve this unexplained set of changes, and BCI *really* doesn't, because they have done an awesome job assembling features for this set.First and foremost of these extras is a radio play rendition of Michael Reaves' unproduced (and nigh legendary) series finale, ""Requiem"". While Katie Leigh (voice of Sheila, the thief) is the only original cast member present, the voices assembled (especially for Hank and Dungeon Master) are close matches. Second are two commentaries (moderated excellently by Andy Mangels) and a very nice documentary. Third is the alternate/rare footage, but there are only two of the episode previews, and the best of the series openings (for the second season) looks like an ancient PAL transfer (sped up and zoomed in). Fourth is a plethora of scripts, storyboards, and other documents from the series' production. Also present is a fan-made production and extensive (and I mean *extensive*) character and object biographies (with appropriate clips from the series).If not for Disney's imposed meddling with the soundtrack, this set would qualify as the best '80s cartoon released to date. It has a great deal of special features, excellent packaging, and even manages to (finally!) bridge the gap between the actual D&D; game to the series. While I would have liked to have seen all of the ""Today on Dungeons & Dragons..."" previews (or at least known that this was an issue, so I could have contributed the two or three extras I have on barely-acceptable VHS tapes) and the season 2 opening at its proper speed and resolution, these seem like minor concerns when compared to the unnecessary music replacement on this set.

Along the way they face down evil and are supposed to grow as people.The production values were good for the time and the episodes here are in very good shape so if you loved this 30 years ago, you will not be disappointed.

Yes I know it was a kids show and all but the level of violence was laughable. In a world with knights and beasts etc you rarely see so much as a pen knife , never mind a sword and the weapons they have are' energy based"" so no one really gets hurt. No I don't want a blood soaked slaughter but freaking Ricocheted Rabbit or Quickdraw McGraw had more violence than these teens battling evil.

And, as thrilled as I am to own the complete Dungeons & Dragons series, I must confess I'm a little disappointed with the gimmicky packaging.  The D&D set comes in a very nicely decorated red box, the top of which, unfortunately, is poorly constructed with a weakness at the right and left sides.  As a result, mine arrived with a crease and a tear on one side.  The bonus ""Animated Series Handbook"" is also very sloppily assembled so that all the pages are loose and falling out before you've even laid a finger on it.  The DVDs come on one of those bothersome fold-out cardboard and clear plastic things.  Discs 2 and 3, and 4 and 5 overlap each other in their holders, so you have to remove the top disc in order to get at the bottom disc.  The whole package, when placed on your DVD shelf, will stick out about a half inch more than your standard DVD cases.  BCI should have stuck with the much more serviceable slim cases in slipcover packaging used for the Defenders of the Earth set (which you should purchase at once if you haven't already done so).  Thankfully, none of my discs were loose or scratched (unlike my He-Man discs) and everything plays fine aside from a brief instance of pixilation and static sounds during ""Servant of Evil"" on disc 2, and some out of sync vocals on a couple other episodes.  I also have to say that the ""FOX KIDS...FOX KIDS...FOX KIDS..."" chant at the closing of every show is really annoying.

Unfortunately, BCI had financial problem and in 2009, Mill Creek Entertainment acquired the rights to this series and it know as ""Dungeons & Dragons: The Complete Animated Series"" on amazon (yes, the listing only replaces the dash with a semicolon), which simply repackaged the episodes in a 3-disc set. The cover on the Mill Creek Entertainment looks slightly more professional, but DO NOT be fooled, it has NONE of the special features.The BCI set featured a ton of bonus content including a 30-minute documentary, two audio commentaries, a 32-page hardcover game supplement exclusively by Wizards of the Coast, a radio-style presentation of the final episode that was never completed in animation, a short live-action fan film, alternate and rare footage, a Choose Your Own Adventure DVD game, DVD-ROM features, and 50 profiles of many characters and monsters. There's even a few more items I didnt mention.The BCI set is a fan favorite, and although there seem to be a few audio edits that are know to exist in this set, if you're really a stickler for authenticity then you can always buy the Mill Creek Entertainment version at a later date (they're fairly cheap). So please, buy the BCI versions to get all the special features that us hardcore fans have always wanted. It truly is a great send off for the series.

I accidentally came across this looking up something else, but i'm glad i did.  Unfortunately, all i can recall of this show was that it was rather colorful and detailed in its animation at the time, the characters were unique and fun, the storylines and adventures were interesting with more mature elements to it than most other sat morning offerings, and of course...the multi-headed dragon pictured on the cover!  For me personally as a kid, this ranked higher than TRANSFORMERS, THUNDERCATS, TMNT, and anything else that was big during that time period.  I usually wait for box-sets to drop in price or go used, but this one(the complete series for about $35-$40) is on pre-order.  Btw, thanks for the in-depth review/info from the reviewer above.  I don't have anything new i can add to that great preview, but i can add another 'highly recommended' and another 5-star rating to strengthen its average.

He liked the actual game, I liked the cartoon.The cartoon is basically about a few kids who are together at a carnival. They go on this ride and are transported to another realm, This realm is inhabited with many mythical creatures such as unicorns, 3 headed dragons, and a evil sorcerer named Venger. The kids, led by Dungeon Master who appears out of nowhere, says a riddle for the kids to complete a quest, journey or a way to get home. The kids: an acrobat, cavalier, ranger (with the best energy bolt arrows), a young barbarian, and a magician are given special weapons and/or equipment. Venger, the evil sorcerer wants the special weapons and equipment. So the kids have to watch out for Venger as well as the 3-headed dragon named Teamac who can't stand Venger as well as the kids.The stories are nicely developed and if you are into fantasy and mythical creatures, you will like this. The box comes with all of the episodes in the short animated series that use to be on Saturday mornings. There are a lot of goodies within the box. Mine came with a metal dragon. For the price, with all of its goodies, as well as all of the episodes, is a great deal especially since there are a lot of DVD's that hardly have any extras or the ones that do, charge an enormous price. A small book explaining the animated series, behind the scenes material, and a lot more is included on the DVD's. The one disappointing thing is the fact that the last episode (the series finale) is not even a cartoon, it's a sound-bite like something you'd hear on the radio. It's been a while since I actually saw the series on TV so I'm guessing that the show was canceled before the final episode was completed. If not, it would of been nice for the series finale episode to be included. The cartoons look great after 20 years.If you had any interest in Dungeons and Dragons the game and/or genres about fantasy and mythical creatures, this is a must have for your collection because I've haven't even seen it on T.V. in well over 10 years. Someone told me (if you live in the New York metropolitan area) that it's been seen on the Boomerang channel (carried by the Monopoly; Cablevision) but it depends in your location.

Fortunately Mill Creek Entertainment, which by the way is distributed by BCI's parent company, Navarre, has acquired the rights to bring many of BCI's titles to the home market once more.In the case of Dungeons & Dragons, this set represents the complete series released to the home market once more at a fraction of the cost of the BCI release.  Coming in at a total runtime of 686 minutes, this set spans 3 discs and contains a freshened up version of the art showcased on the BCI set.D&D; was one of those cartoons that I watched as a kid back in the early 1980s nearly every week without fail that was unique in two areas: First, it was one of few shows that I was engrossed in that wasn't toy-driven. In other words, unlike He-Man and most other animated programs I consider myself a fan of, I never had a D&D; toy with which to continue my own version of the excitement once the show faded to black. Secondly, despite my youth at the time of its original CBS broadcast, this one managed to stick with me even after all these years. Somehow I still recalled quotes from episodes that I hadn't had any contact with for 25 years. Not bad considering I have difficulty recalling quotes that my boss bestowed upon me just yesterday.So what's the problem with jumping back in to a series that I regard so highly you ask? I feared that perhaps I remembered it too fondly! So often in revisiting landmarks of our own youth, we're sadly disappointed in how unimpressive the experience actually is. We all have a tendency of making things more grandiose over time. I figured maybe Dungeons & Dragons was best left to the blissful halls of memory where it was, in my opinion, nothing short of classic.That said, I reluctantly slipped the first of this three-disc compilation into the player in the hopes that I hadn't disturbed a childhood memory. Boy was I in for a surprise! Rather than disappointing me with a lesson in the limitations of early 1980s animation or the realities of standards and practices when it comes to children's television, I was instead immediately reminded of why I loved the show so much back then. Let me begin this review by saying that truly Dungeons & Dragons was ahead of its time on many levels.The saga begins with an episode that aired on September 17, 1983 in the form of a pilot written by the then overworked Mark Evanier. And while old Mark would contribute only this single episode to the 27 total, he deserves praise for kicking things off on the right foot. Perhaps the show's greatest strength lies in the rich development of the main characters. So often in animation of the time we had heroes who were basically interchangeable in their lines. All of the good guys were essentially the same guy differentiated only by their appearance while all of the bad guys existed only to destroy the good guys. D&D; laid this archetype to rest with six protagonists who had personalities all their own. Not only that but the characters played off each other to perfection. Somehow the show's writers managed to capture the subtle (yet often over the top) dynamic that a fairly large group of children would possess in their interaction. Not only that but these were children who wanted, more than anything else, to simply return home. As a result the writers were presented with many interesting dynamics of individual frustrations and the group's resulting resourcefulness.To aid them on their journey was the enigmatic Dungeon Master, who appeared and disappeared at will but not before dispensing a clue (riddle) that would point our heroes into the right direction. Their ultimate goal was to simply leave the realm of D&D; behind and return home to their families. While that sounds simplistic enough from afar, the show was quite unique in that there were no shortage of opportunities for them to do so along the way. More often than not, their staying in the realm was the result of a decision they consciously made to do what was morally right over what they desired most. While it is said that the proverbial ""dangling of the carrot"" keeps the show moving, the creative team behind D&D; was wise to keep that carrot in the foreground of the action on a nearly weekly basis. While we all secretly wished the kids could just go back home, it was their failures that kept us tuning in week after week.This time around I was far more aware of the show's pop culture inspirations. While the series was modeled after the popular role playing game of the same name, it obviously drew more inspiration from Star Wars than it did rolling dice and earning points. In fact not subtle are the similarities between Hank (the ranger) and Luke Skywalker, Dungeon Master and Yoda, and I won't even bother getting too deeply into the Cloud Bears (let's just say the Ewok village doesn't exist only on the forest moon of Endor but in the Realm of D&D; as well). These uncanny similarities are quite forgivable however, as they don't simply rip off the blockbuster franchise but rather ""borrow"" from some of the energy that made it so popular even after all of these years. Much in the way George Lucas is credited for taking pieces and bits of classic film elements to give Star Wars its timeless appeal, so too does D&D; implement these charms.The other element of D&D; that makes the show remarkable nearly three decades after the fact are the environments and backgrounds. Here is a program that finally delivers upon the potential that is so often flaunted in fantasy shows but so seldom realized. Somehow the Realm just feels spooky. Be it the result of excellently painted skies with many suns and moons or perhaps the fact that rarely are our heroes situated in the same place twice, or maybe it's just the interesting creatures they encounter lurking around nearly every corner. Whatever the case (probably a combination of all of the elements mentioned above) it just plain works. This type of attention to detail is present everywhere in this series and as a result, the show holds up even against today's best fantasy efforts.  The revised price of the Mill Creek release is the icing on the cake.",4,The Silver Lining of BCI's Unfortunate Closing,1252195200,"09 6, 2009",2009,6320,"['denying', 'BCI', 'Eclipse', 'had',

1026105,ASPTG9WNQSW7J,B000JBXY44,Red Demon,"[521, 535]","This was my #1 favorite cartoon series when I was eleven years old in 1983. I watched it religiously on TV back then, and when we got our first VCR, I recorded every re-run and watched those videotapes until I wore them out. Naturally, I was excited to hear this show was finally coming out on DVD. I bought the complete series box set released by BCI right away. All the episodes look great in terms of picture quality. Not to mention, the special features are surprisingly plentiful for an old, mostly-forgotten Saturday morning cartoon, and it really brought back some great memories.Then I discovered a very disappointing problem. And I'm going to sound like a real nit-picker here - but I gotta state my case...Any dedicated fan of this show is familiar with the episode ""The Dragon's Graveyard"" - generally considered to be the best episode of the entire series. That's the one where the kids decide to destroy Venger (the ultimate, evil bad guy) once and for all. They plan to do this by convincing Tiamat (the ultimate, evil 5-headed Dragon) to help them. It's a very cool story, because the good guys basically team up with one arch villain in order to settle their grudge match with another arch villain. As a kid in the 80's, I videotaped this series and ""The Dragon's Graveyard"" was one episode that I went back and watched repeatedly. So, I know that episode almost by heart. One of the things I always loved about that episode, and which I still remember clearly, was its powerful musical score. Especially during the scene where Venger throws fireballs at Uni, the baby Unicorn, nearly killing her, and the scene at the end, where the kids have their final, climactic battle with Venger, pin him against a rock, and lead hero Hank has to make the ultimate decision whether to kill Venger, or let him go. From watching and re-watching this particular episode to death on videotape, I remember very clearly that during these scenes the music had a fast, chaotic, rushing quality - a theme not heard frequently in other episodes - which racheted up the energy and took the drama way beyond typical Saturday morning cartoon fare.And yet, while watching this same classic episode on the BCI-released Dungeons and Dragons DVD set, I noticed that this music had been completely replaced with slower, formulaic sections of music that can be regularly heard elsewhere in the series. This change in the music made the scenes described above considerably less effective, severely weakening the emotional impact of this episode.Allright, now - yes - I realize how trite and ridiculous it must sound for a 30+ year old man to be nit picking the DVD quality of one single episode of a Saturday Morning cartoon show he loved when he was eleven. But the whole reason I bought this DVD set in the first place was to re-experience the innocent fun of those childhood memories, and instead I got a diluted version of that experience.As a matter of fact, in the ""Episode Trivia"" section, it even mentions that another version of ""The Dragon's Graveyard"" episode exists, with a completely different musical score... and when I read that, all I could think was, ""Yeah, no kidding, and you bozos put the weaker of the two versions on the DVD set. Thanks a lot!""So... that's my one huge disappointment with the BCI set, and I'm guessing other fans who are total geeks for this show, will notice and be bothered by it, too.NOW HERE IS THE GOOD NEWS... In 2009, Dungeons and Dragons was RE-RELEASED in a new DVD set, by a company called Mill Creek Entertainment. I had heard rumors that this new release RESTORED ALL of the ORIGINAL MUSIC used on the show, thus presenting every episode AS IT APPEARED, WHEN IT WAS ORIGINALLY SHOWN on TV in the early 1980's. At first I wasn't sure if I should believe the rumors... Then I saw that the Mill Creek release was selling for a surprisingly lower price than the BCI set... Low enough that I decided it was worth giving it another shot.So, I ordered it, and let me tell you as a knowledgeable fan, that yes - the Mill Creek Entertainment release DOES include all the episodes with their original music. THIS is ""The Dragon's Graveyard"" as I remember and love it. Be advised, the Mill Creek release contains no Special Features, which is unfortunate, but I find myself not caring about that. The important thing is to have all the original episodes in their original form. And again, the price on the Mill Creek set is also a lot cheaper than the price on the BCI set, so it's hard to complain about the lack of ""extras"".Bottom line - this is a great cartoon series. But if you want to experience this show in its original form - do yourself a favor: Snub the BCI set, and buy the Mill Creek Entertainment set. Take if from a long time fan of this show. I was deeply disappointed with the BCI set, and very, very happy with the Mill Creek set.",4,A long-time fan says: Make sure you buy the version released by Mill Creek Entertainment.

Ultimately after reading reviews, I went with my gut instics & decided on this version. It has all 27 episodes (as do the other sets). And in my opinion it is a decent/adequate quality of DVD's and case. The case art is cool & the designs on the DVD's look good too. The case is like a regular DVD case. But inside has a pivital/hinged piece that holds a DVD on each side. Then, the 3rd DVD is on the back part of the inner case, behind the pivital/hinged piece. The DVD's stay on just fine. The episodes quality have been getting mixed reviews by people too! In my opinion. The episodes look overall pretty good! Someone stated it looks like the lower quality uploads on youtube. I would have to disagree w/ that. Even when playing it on my LCD TV's, w/ a Blu-ray player using HDMI cable, it looks just fine. It's as good of quality as I remember seeing it on TV as a kid. Which was cool for back then. The sound is also as I remember....Adequate. My 9yr old son & I have been watching and enjoying these the last few days. I'm sure on some older (90's) TV's it would look exact as it did back in the 80's when it aired! And some older shows such as this, don't look too easy on the eyes on new LCD's w/ modern DVD/Blu-ray players. But this particular set holds it's own! I feel confident saying if you are on here looking and debating on getting this 3disc set. You obviously know and enjoy the D&D animated series. And would likely enjoy this version!!! Could they have made the box/case even more fancy, sure. Could they have remastered the audio & visuals...Perhaps. But when it's all said & done. This cartoon is 30yrs old now. And even with technology, you can only ""remaster"" older shows so much. This 3disc set is only like 5-6 dollars for the entire series. And for that price you get a good transfer of the episodes. W/ a good cover art, good disc desgin, and decent (not the best, but far from the worst) case. Why knitpick and gripe about the episode quality? It's as good as it was when airing. And you paid a little under $10.00, after shipping even. For the whole set! The saying is ""You get what you pay for."" But in this case, I'd say you get more than what you pay for.  I gave it 4 & a half stars because yes, it could be a little better. But doesn't need to be.",5,4 &1/2 stars!

There the kids [garbed in medieval attire] each carried a magic weapon given them by the Yoda-esque Dungeon Master, their guide in the realm who seemingly distributed the weapons based on the kids individual personalities and abilities. The weapons, desperately sought after by Venger, the force of evil, not only protected the kids but also those in need of their aid which in effect benefited the kids as Dungeon Master informs them at the end of an episode ""With each good deed, you grow more worthy of finding a way home. In time, you will be rewarded."" Eric, the Cavalier (the show's comedy relief and most popular character) sarcastically remarks ""In time for what?--Our retirement?!"" To which Dungeon Master casually replies with ""Patience, Cavalier. Patience.""Featuring the voice talents of Willie Aames & Adam Rich (Eight is Enough) and Donny Most (Happy Days); production services of Marvel Productions, Ltd; and stories written by veterans Jeffrey Scott, Steve Gerber, Marc Scott Zicree and Michael Reaves (just to name a few), Dungeons & Dragons was a crowning example of a great Saturday morning cartoon--so amazingly fun and entertaining that it left you thinking about it long after the show was over.

Robare ""smurfwreck""","[1, 1]","You know, if there were an award for the best company producing and distributing DVD sets in North America I would have to say that hands down, BCI Eclipse deserves it more than goth kids who cut themselves deserve a barrel full of happy face band-aids. Out of all the 80s TV on DVD sets I've purchased (hell of any from any decade) BCI has consistently brought out fun shows in unique and beautiful packaging at a very low price point. Just take a look at one of the He-Man sets with their vibrantly colored foldout digipaks, high episode counts (at least 32 episodes per set), the small color prints included in each set, and all for about $25-$35 depending on where you shop. And that's just the packaging. Their DVDs are also crammed full of trivia, documentaries, a slew of episode info, not to mention a few easter eggs here and there.I recently received the complete Dungeons and Dragons cartoon DVD box set that was also released by BCI under their Ink and Paint imprint and it's just more of the same. The set is really gorgeous and it's chock full of everything you'd ever want from this cartoon. The set itself was designed to look like the core rulebook set from 1983, the same edition that came out when the cartoon premiered on American television. It's also set up like a box set (think shoebox) instead of the more normal slipcase, but inside is the same sort of foldout digipak that BCI and most other slipcase DVD sets come with.This set contains the complete cartoon series, with all 27 episodes from seasons 1-3, a 30 minute documentary with interviews from the show's creative staff, a bunch of alternate footage (including the three different versions of the show's opening credits), a fan film, as well as a special treat for fans of the show, a radio play recording of the never produced final episode of the show that gives some closure to the D&D; cartoon story. The set also includes a cute little hardbound D&D; role-playing sourcebook that has player info for all the characters and items from the cartoon.Anyway, as far as the cartoon itself goes, I think it holds up rather well which is a credit to the creators and writers of the series including Mark Evanier, Jeffery Scott, Michael Reeves and Paul Dini. Like He-Man, this was one of the first shows that brought action elements back into Saturday Morning cartoons, which made it both fun and exciting. Its shows like this that would really pave the way for the more intelligent non-comedic action cartoons of the 90s and beyond like Batman and Justice League. If you've never had the opportunity to catch it, the show is about six kids who get pulled into the fantasy world of Dungeons and Dragons while riding a roller coaster of the same name at a theme park or carnival or something.They each end up with special powers, armor or weapons that represent various classes from the Dungeon and Dragons world, the Ranger (Hank, voiced by Willie Aames of Charles in Charge and Bibleman fame) with his energy bow and arrows, an Acrobat (Diana, voiced by Tonya Gail Smith) with her resizable bo-staff/javelin, a thief (Shelia, voiced by Katie Leigh) who has a nifty invisibility cloak, the cavalier (Eric, voiced by Don Most of Happy Days fame) who has a nifty shield, the Wizard, (Presto, voice by Adam Rich of 8 is Enough fame) who gets a hat that he can ""pull"" magic out of, and a barbarian (Bobby, voiced by Ted Field III) who had a bitchin' club and an almost annoying pet unicorn Uni (voiced by Frank Welker, the man responsible for voicing two of my all time best Transformers voices, Soundwave and Megatron.)Together with the Dungeon Master, the kids are fighting against Venger (voiced by Peter Cullen, who voiced Optimus Prime on Transformers), an evil tyrant set out to ruling the D&D; lands. I always dug Venger because he rode on a Nightmare and had that really disturbing single horn on his head. He always reminded me of another screen villain, the Source of All Evil from Time Bandits.What I think is pretty awesome about this show is that it manages to capture a very specific feeling and area of pop culture from the 80's, that of book and dice role playing as well as Saturday morning cartoons (which in the 80's had a much different feel from the Saturday morning cartoons of the 70's.) Like I said above, and can't seem to stress enough, that the box set is beautiful and at about $35, is the perfect price for a nice nostalgia DVD set like this (end product gushing and pimping.)I've got a lot of fond memories of watching this show, most of which revolve around getting up early on Saturday mornings, feigning sick to get out of soccer practice, and then vegging out to this show with either a bowl full of Chef Boyardee mini raviolis or Capt'n Crunch with Crunchberries, dry because I hated the damn Soggies. I also remember being completely ignorant of the table top role playing game, though I did have a couple of the D&D; action figures, namely the Warduke and Strongheart. I think in my silly little mind world, the Warduke figure was actually more at home in the Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome world than like a He-Man type world, what with his half on, half naked costume and evil red eyes.

Being a lover of everything 80s, I decided to pick this up. Watched the first disc so far, and....it's alright. The storyline is kind of weak, even for a 1980s cartoon, but it's still pretty fun to watch. I picked this set, and not the out of print BCI set, because I didn't really remember the show from when I was a kid and the BCI set didn't really have any amazing extras. The one thing that this version has over the BCI set, other than being FAR cheaper, is that it has the original music. Whereas the BCI set had replacement music in at least one of the episodes. The quality of the animation is stellar, especially for an 80s cartoon.Like I said, the stories in the show are pretty weak. If you like fantasy 80s cartoons, I think I'd stick with stuff like He-man, She-Ra, Defenders Of The Earth, Thundercats, and even JEM. The vibe will be sort of the same and the stories in those shows are much better and, at times, deeper and more involved.",3,It's Alright....I Guess,1380067200,"09 25, 2013",2013,1046,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'played', 'game', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'kind', 'thing', ""'d"", 'be', 'Being', 'lover', 'everything', '80s', 'decided', 'pick', 'up', 'first', 'disc', 'so', 'far', '.it', 'alright', 'storyline', 'kind', 'weak', 'even', '1980s', 'cartoon', 'still', 'pretty', 'fun', 'watch', 'picked', 'set', 'not', 'out', 'print', 'BCI', 'set', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'remember', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'BCI', 'set', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'amazing', 'extras', 'one', 'thing', 'version', 'over', 'BCI', 'set', 'other', 'being', 'FAR', 'cheaper', 'original', 'music', 'BCI', 'set', 'had', 'replacement', 'music', 'least', 'one', 'episodes', 'quality', 'animation', 'stellar', 'especially', '80s', 'cartoon.Like', 'said', 'stories', 'show', 'are', 'pretty', 'weak', 'like', 'fantasy', '80s', 'cartoons', 'think', ""'d"", 'stick', 'stuff', 'He-man', 'She-Ra', 'Defenders', 'Earth', 'Thundercats', 'even', 'JEM', 'vibe', 'will', 'be', 'sort', 'same', 'stories', 'shows', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'times', 'deeper', 'more', 'involved']",Dungeons & Dragons - The Complete Animated Series
1026123,A2NXAV1SNXWA9H,B000JBXY44,S. R.,"[212, 224]","After two decades, all 27 episodes of the classic 'Dungeons & Dragons' animated TV series are finally available on DVD!  This was a Saturday morning staple for many who have anxiously awaited its arrival on DVD for some time.  BCI (who was also responsible for the exemplaryHe-Man & the Masters of the UniverseDVD sets) has released not only the complete series, but a ton of extras in this beautifully remastered 5-disc boxed set.  For the uninitiated, this series tells the tale of six kids who, after riding the Dungeons & Dragons rollercoaster, mysteriously get sucked into its fantasy world.  There, each of them gains magical talents and abilities, all the better to survive their time in the Realm. The bow-shooting ranger, the acrobat, the thief, the cavalier, the wizard, and the boy-barbarian are soon joined by a baby unicorn, and tutored by the mysterious Dungeon Master.  Opposing them is the evil sorcerer Venger, as well as various monsters and entities all intent on keeping the kids from getting back home.  This was one of CBS' most popular animated series, airing from 1983-1986, and later on the Fox Kids network as reruns.  Created by the legendary Marvel Productions, the series was based on the popular TSR role-playing game created in 1974, which spawned an entire industry.  Here are the special features;*All-new half hour documentary, 'Entering the Realm of Dungeons & Dragons' featuring interviews with the show's production team, writers, animators, and network executives*Two commentary tracks for episodes 'Night of No Tomorrow' & 'The Dragon's Graveyard' with producer Bob Richardson, story editor/ voice director Hank Saroyan, writers Mark Evanier & Michael Reaves, and CBS executives Ted Field II & Judy Price*Radio show-style presentation of the unaired final episode 'Requiem' featuring select original voice cast members*Full length animated storyboard with interactive episode comparison for Episode #16 'The Girl Who Dreamed Of Tomorrow'*'Choose Your Own Adventure' DVD Game & 'Uni's Fun Facts' Trivia*50 characters, creatures & artifacts profiles with bios, images & clips, plus extensive gallery of original model sheets & memorabilia*Short live-action film by fan Sean Kennedy*Alternate and rare footage plus hidden easter eggs*DVD-ROM features including scripts for multiple episodes (including the un-produced series finale script), complete storyboards and the original series bible*Episode guide booklet with show's synopsis, writers and original air dates*Official 'Dungeons & Dragons' hard-cover game supplement created exclusively by Wizards of the Coast featuring 32 pages of character profiles and stat blocks.  The adventure is a prelude to the episode 'The Dragon's Graveyard' and is designed to bridge the game and the animated TV series.  The characters and world within the animated series are now playable with the traditional RPG game.It is unfortunate that some uninformed adults originally feared that the game and show promoted occult activities (a claim that seems ludicrous in retrospect).  Eventually, it was not magic that led to the show's premature cancellation in 1986, but rather sagging ratings.  But thanks to this DVD release, fans can relive all these great adventures anytime they want.  For a small company, the now defunct BCI showed unparalleled commitment to modern cartoon classics through their beautifully remastered DVD sets and extensive supplemental material that were second to none.  Fortunately for fans, BCI released a slew of classic cartoons on DVD before closing its doors for good.",5,Gone But Not Forgotten!,1160870400,"10 15, 2006",2006,3573,"['two', 'decades', '27', 'episodes', 'classic', ""'Dungeons"", 'Dragons', 'animated', 'TV', 'series', 'are', 'finally', 'available', 'DVD', 'was', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'staple', 'many', 'who', 'have', 'anxiously', 'awaited', 'arrival', 'DVD', 'time', 'BCI', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'responsible', 'exemplaryHe-Man', 'Masters', 'UniverseDVD', 'sets', 'released', 'not', 'only', 'complete', 'series', 'ton', 'extras', 'beautifully', 'remastered', '5-disc', 'boxed', 'set', 'uninitiated', 'series', 'tale', 'six', 'kids', 'who', 'riding', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'rollercoaster', 'mysteriously', 'get', 'sucked', 'fantasy', 'world', 'gains', 'magical', 'talents', 'abilities', 'better', 'survive', 'time', 'Realm', 'bow-shooting', 'ranger', 'acrobat', 'thief', 'cavalier', 'wizard', 'boy-barbarian', 'are', 'soon', 'joined', 'baby', 'unicorn', 'tutored', 'mysterious', 'Dungeon', 'Master', 'Opposing', 'evil', 'sorcerer', 'Venger', 'as', 'well', 'various', 'monsters', 'entities', 'intent', 'keeping', 'kids', 'getting', 'back', 'home', 'was', 'one', 'CBS', 'most', 'popular', 'animated', 'series', 'airing', '1983-1986', 'later', 'Fox', 'Kids', 'network', 'reruns', 'Created', 'legendary', 'Marvel', 'Productions', 'series', 'was', 'based', 'popular', 'TSR', 'role-playing', 'game', 'created', '1974', 'spawned', 'entire', 'industry', 'Here', 'are', 'special', 'features', '*All-new', 'half', 'hour', 'documentary', ""'Entering"", 'Realm', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'featuring', 'interviews', 'show', 'production', 'team', 'writers', 'animators', 'network', 'executives*Two', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'episodes', ""'Night"", 'Tomorrow', ""'The"", 'Dragon', 'Graveyard', 'producer', 'Bob', 'Richardson', 'story', 'editor/', 'voice', 'director', 'Hank', 'Saroyan', 'writers', 'Mark', 'Evanier', 'Michael', 'Reaves', 'CBS', 'executives', 'Ted', 'Field', 'II', 'Judy', 'Price*Radio', 'show-style', 'presentation', 'unaired', 'final', 'episode', 'featuring', 'select', 'original', 'voice', 'cast', 'members*Full', 'length', 'animated', 'storyboard', 'interactive', 'episode', 'comparison', 'Episode', '16', 'Girl', 'Who', 'Dreamed', ""Tomorrow'*'Choose"", 'Your', 'Own', 'Adventure', 'DVD', 'Game', ""'Uni"", 'Fun', 'Facts', 'Trivia*50', 'characters', 'creatures', 'artifacts', 'bios', 'images', 'clips', 'extensive', 'gallery', 'original', 'model', 'sheets', 'memorabilia*Short', 'live-action', 'film', 'fan', 'Sean', 'Kennedy*Alternate', 'rare', 'footage', 'hidden', 'easter', 'eggs*DVD-ROM', 'features', 'including', 'scripts', 'multiple', 'episodes', 'including', 'un-produced', 'series', 'finale', 'script', 'complete', 'storyboards', 'original', 'series', 'bible*Episode', 'guide', 'booklet', 'show', 'synopsis', 'writers', 'original', 'air', 'dates*Official', ""'Dungeons"", 'Dragons', 'hard-cover', 'game', 'supplement', 'created', 'exclusively', 'Wizards', 'Coast', 'featuring', '32', 'pages', 'character', 'profiles', 'stat', 'blocks', 'adventure', 'prelude', 'episode', 'Dragon', 'Graveyard', 'designed', 'bridge', 'game', 'animated', 'TV', 'series', 'characters', 'world', 'animated', 'series', 'are', 'now', 'playable', 'traditional', 'RPG', 'game.It', 'unfortunate', 'uninformed', 'adults', 'originally', 'feared', 'game', 'show', 'promoted', 'occult', 'activities', 'claim', 'ludicrous', 'retrospect', 'Eventually', 'was', 'not', 'magic', 'led', 'show', 'premature', 'cancellation', '1986', 'rather', 'sagging', 'ratings', 'thanks', 'DVD', 'release', 'fans', 'can', 'relive', 'great', 'adventures', 'anytime', 'want', 'small', 'company', 'now', 'defunct', 'BCI', 'showed', 'unparalleled', 'commitment', 'modern', 'cartoon', 'classics', 'beautifully', 'remastered', 'DVD', 'sets', 'extensive', 'supplemental', 'material', 'were', 'second', 'none', 'Fortunately', 'fans', 'BCI', 'released', 'slew', 'classic', 'cartoons', 'DVD', 'closing', 'doors', 'good']",Dungeons & Dragons - The Complete Animated Series

You can watch some of the episodes on YouTube for free, if you want to get a feel for the show first as well. I'm not sure every episode is there though.There are no extras on the discs.

1026129,AXFPFO28Y04BW,B000JBXY44,Thanos6,"[4, 4]","Unlike many others who have reviewed, I did not watch this series when it first aired, as I was only three years old when it was cancelled.  My girlfriend though, is several years older and remembers and loves it well, so I bought this set for her as a present.  After she'd finished hugging the air out of my lungs, we decided to have a marathon and go through all the episodes in a day.And I fell in love with this series.  For a Saturday morning cartoon (whatever happened to those, anyway?) the characterization can be surprisingly deep, especially for (but by no means limited to) Eric and Presto.  Standout episodes include ""The Dragon's Graveyard"" for its ambiguous morality, and both ""The Last Illusion"" and ""Child of the Stargazer"" for their themes of bittersweet love.  And I can't forget the apocalyptic ""Dungeon at the Heart of Dawn.""And then there's ""Requiem."" For a series whose main purpose was a quest to leave that quest unresolved was criminal; for the series to have a script resolving that quest but not animating was nothing short of a SIN.  Thankfully, at long last we can read (and hear, thanks to voice acting) what may be their last adventure.  This special feature alone is worth the set; my girlfriend had tears in her eyes when it was over; I softly asked her if the twenty-year wait was worth it to know the ending and she nodded emphatically.

1026138,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,B000JBXY44,Zack Davisson,"[2, 2]","I picked these DVDs up pretty much on a whim.  I watched them a bit when I was a kid--I was about 11 years old--but I never really got into the series.  I had just discovered Japanese cartoons, and their more nuanced and continued plotlines made American cartoons look shallow and childish by comparison. But I have been a life-long D&D; player, so when I saw how cheap the collection was I figured that even if they were as mediocre as I remembered them it would still be fun to check them out and finally watch the whole series.I am actually surprised at how well the series hold up. Released from 1983-1985, ""Dungeons and Dragons"" was on the cusp of when American animation technology and techniques advanced, and some actual writers were slowly raising the level of intelligence in the storylines.  They are still the shallow, one-note, one-plot adventures representative of the times--they walk the endless treadmill of trying to find a way home, and do little else--but the writers managed to sneak in some actual characterization and moral challenges for the kids.  I was surprised to see love affairs, moral quandaries, and in the episode ""The Dragon's Graveyard"" even the ultimate question of ""Why don't we just kill the main villain and be done with it?""Apparently, that moral quandary was a bit too much for parent's groups at the time, who tried to have the episode banned, as well as run a disclaimer before the entire series warning that ""Dungeons & Dragons had been linked to real life violent deaths.""  Ah, parent's groups ... there is an interesting interview with series-writer Mark Evanier where he talks about parent's groups' interference with the show, and how they forced the character of Erik on the show in order to give it the ""pro-social"" moral of ""The group is always right...the complainer is always wrong.""After watching the entire series, I think the 11-year old me sold the series a bit short.  Sure, it is noRecord of Lodoss War, but for an `80s ""Dungeons and Dragons""-themed cartoon it has a bit of an edge to it and remains entertaining. The character designs are good, the animation is fluid for the times, and it is fun seeing the D&D; monsters animated. (It is miles better than the wretchedDungeons & Dragonslive-action film). I am glad I gave the show a second chance.I got the Mill Creek version of the collection, and it is disappointing to read some reviews and find out that there is no real ""Perfect Collection"" of this series.  The BCI release had a bunch of extra features, including a Radio Play version of the scripted-but-never-made ""final episode,"" but they messed around with the soundtracks.  This Mill Creek release has the original soundtracks restored, but without the bonus features. It would be nice to have them merged into a single release with the best of both versions.",4,"Much, much better than expected",1341792000,"07 9, 2012",2012,2831,"['picked', 'DVDs', 'up', 'pretty', 'much', 'whim', 'watched', 'bit', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'was', '11', 'years', 'old', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'series', 'had', 'just', 'discovered', 'Japanese', 'cartoons', 'more', 'nuanced', 'continued', 'plotlines', 'made', 'American', 'cartoons', 'look', 'shallow', 'childish', 'comparison', 'have', 'been', 'life-long', 'D', 'D', 'player', 'when', 'saw', 'how', 'cheap', 'collection', 'was', 'figured', 'even', 'were', 'as', 'mediocre', 'remembered', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'fun', 'check', 'out', 'finally', 'watch', 'whole', 'series.I', 'am', 'actually', 'surprised', 'how', 'well', 'series', 'hold', 'up', 'Released', '1983-1985', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'was', 'cusp', 'when', 'American', 'animation', 'technology', 'techniques', 'advanced', 'actual', 'writers', 'were', 'slowly', 'raising', 'level', 'intelligence', 'storylines', 'are', 'still', 'shallow', 'one-note', 'one-plot', 'adventures', 'representative', 'times', 'walk', 'endless', 'treadmill', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'home', 'do', 'little', 'else', 'writers', 'managed', 'sneak', 'actual', 'characterization', 'moral', 'challenges', 'kids', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'love', 'affairs', 'moral', 'quandaries', 'episode', 'Dragon', 'Graveyard', 'even', 'ultimate', 'question', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'kill', 'main', 'villain', 'be', 'done', 'Apparently', 'moral', 'quandary', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'parent', 'groups', 'time', 'who', 'tried', 'have', 'episode', 'banned', 'as', 'well', 'run', 'disclaimer', 'entire', 'series', 'warning', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'had', 'been', 'linked', 'real', 'life', 'violent', 'deaths', 'Ah', 'parent', 'groups', 'interesting', 'interview', 'series-writer', 'Mark', 'Evanier', 'where', 'parent', 'groups', 'interference', 'show', 'how', 'forced', 'character', 'Erik', 'show', 'order', 'give', 'pro-social', 'moral', 'group', 'always', 'right', 'complainer', 'always', 'wrong', 'watching', 'entire', 'series', 'think', '11-year', 'old', 'sold', 'series', 'bit', 'short', 'Sure', 'noRecord', 'Lodoss', 'War', '80s', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', '-themed', 'cartoon', 'bit', 'edge', 'entertaining', 'character', 'designs', 'are', 'good', 'animation', 'fluid', 'times', 'fun', 'seeing', 'D', 'D', 'monsters', 'animated', 'miles', 'better', 'wretchedDungeons', 'Dragonslive-action', 'film', 'am', 'glad', 'gave', 'show', 'second', 'chance.I', 'got', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'version', 'collection', 'disappointing', 'read', 'reviews', 'find', 'out', 'real', 'Perfect', 'Collection', 'series', 'BCI', 'release', 'had', 'bunch', 'extra', 'features', 'including', 'Radio', 'Play', 'version', 'scripted-but-never-made', 'final', 'episode', 'messed', 'soundtracks', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'release', 'original', 'soundtracks', 'restored', 'bonus', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'have', 'merged', 'single', 'release', 'best', 'versions']",Dungeons & Dragons - The Complete Animated Series
