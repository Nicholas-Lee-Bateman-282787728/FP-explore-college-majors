Rubbo""","[13, 13]","[BRIAN ENO (1971-1976) THE MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH - Screen Format 4:3]  An incredible in-depth documentary chronicling Eno's most prolific and experimental years and output, from pre-Roxy Music artschool days to collaborations with Robert Fripp, Phil Manzanera, John Cale, Nico, Cluster, Portsmouth Symphonia, 801,Gavin Bryars, David Toop, Harold Budd, Ambient music and of course, David Bowie. No musical stone is left unturned during this remarkable period of productivity in Eno's continuing career and, though this may be an unsanctioned chronicle (something I'm usually adverse to and highly skeptical of), it could only have been better if the man himself was involved. It's a collection of photos, videos, and interviews with writers Eric Tamm (who wrote bios on both Fripp and Eno), Mark Prendergast (The Ambient Century), Geeta Gayal (Another Green World), David Sheppard (On Some Faraway Beach - The Life and Times of Brian Eno), Johnny Rogan (an eccentric, notable biographer of many works), as well as prominent music critics Robert Christgau and Simon Reynolds, musicians Lloyd Watson, David Toop, Percy Jones, John Hassell, Bryan Turrington, Chris Spedding , David O'List and Rodelius. These are people who have been close to the 'nerve net' of focus here and not hangers-on, former-but-now-irate bedmates and rumor propagators. It's a fairly meticulous examination that clocks in at well over 2  hours, and never gets boring, bland, too analytical or critical. It's thoroughly entertaining on all counts.Several reviewers here have taken issue that Eno has no involvement and that there's no newly unearthed music to be found, even that some of the details are incorrect (which is entirely untrue) - didn't they know this was an unauthorized biography? As Robert Fripp used to say at his small, improvised Frippertronic shows during the 70's, ""Leave your elevated expectations at the door and you're more likely to enjoy this for what it is"" (I'm paraphrasing). Ignore the naysayers. All followers of Roxy Music, Eno and those mentioned above need to add this one to their music libraries immediately, if not yesterday. It's enlightening, engaging, informative and essential to all who claim to love and know about important music. As reclusive as Eno is these days, we're not likely to get better than this. Don't pass this one up - you'll be sorry you did.",5,Much Better Than You'd Think...,1313107200,"08 12, 2011",2011,2372,"['[', 'BRIAN', 'ENO', '1971-1976', 'THE', 'MAN', 'WHO', 'FELL', 'TO', 'EARTH', 'Screen', 'Format', '4:3', ']', 'incredible', 'in-depth', 'documentary', 'chronicling', 'Eno', 'most', 'prolific', 'experimental', 'years', 'output', 'pre-Roxy', 'Music', 'artschool', 'days', 'collaborations', 'Robert', 'Fripp', 'Phil', 'Manzanera', 'John', 'Cale', 'Nico', 'Cluster', 'Portsmouth', 'Symphonia', '801', 'Gavin', 'Bryars', 'David', 'Toop', 'Harold', 'Budd', 'Ambient', 'music', 'course', 'David', 'Bowie', 'musical', 'stone', 'left', 'unturned', 'remarkable', 'period', 'productivity', 'Eno', 'continuing', 'career', 'may', 'be', 'unsanctioned', 'chronicle', 'something', ""'m"", 'usually', 'adverse', 'highly', 'skeptical', 'could', 'only', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'man', 'was', 'involved', 'collection', 'photos', 'videos', 'interviews', 'writers', 'Eric', 'Tamm', 'who', 'wrote', 'bios', 'Fripp', 'Eno', 'Mark', 'Prendergast', 'Ambient', 'Century', 'Geeta', 'Gayal', 'Green', 'World', 'David', 'Sheppard', 'Faraway', 'Beach', 'Life', 'Times', 'Brian', 'Eno', 'Johnny', 'Rogan', 'eccentric', 'notable', 'biographer', 'many', 'works', 'as', 'well', 'prominent', 'music', 'critics', 'Robert', 'Christgau', 'Simon', 'Reynolds', 'Lloyd', 'Watson', 'David', 'Toop', 'Percy', 'Jones', 'John', 'Hassell', 'Bryan', 'Turrington', 'Chris', 'Spedding', 'David', ""O'List"", 'Rodelius', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'close', ""'nerve"", 'net', 'focus', 'here', 'not', 'hangers-on', 'former-but-now-irate', 'bedmates', 'rumor', 'propagators', 'fairly', 'meticulous', 'examination', 'well', '2', 'hours', 'never', 'boring', 'bland', 'too', 'analytical', 'critical', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'counts.Several', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'taken', 'issue', 'Eno', 'involvement', 'newly', 'unearthed', 'music', 'be', 'found', 'even', 'details', 'are', 'incorrect', 'entirely', 'untrue', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'unauthorized', 'biography', 'Robert', 'Fripp', 'used', 'say', 'small', 'improvised', 'Frippertronic', 'shows', '70', 'Leave', 'elevated', 'expectations', 'door', ""'re"", 'more', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'what', ""'m"", 'paraphrasing', 'naysayers', 'followers', 'Roxy', 'Music', 'Eno', 'mentioned', 'above', 'need', 'add', 'one', 'music', 'libraries', 'immediately', 'not', 'yesterday', 'enlightening', 'engaging', 'informative', 'essential', 'who', 'claim', 'love', 'know', 'important', 'music', 'As', 'reclusive', 'Eno', 'days', ""'re"", 'not', 'likely', 'get', 'better', 'Do', ""n't"", 'pass', 'one', 'up', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sorry', 'did']",N/A
1422478,AZS9KPEYA0O5Z,B004NTDF24,"Guy M. Budziak ""noir enthusiast""","[2, 2]","After reading a few of the of the other contributors' reviews I felt I just had to throw my hat into the ring. I was an enthusiastic fan and admirer of Eno's musical efforts starting in 1973 when I heard ""Baby's On Fire"" coming in over the airwaves from Canada (I'm a native Detroiter, where Eno's music wasn't getting any airplay then or since). Having watched this documentary I found it very informative and thoroughly enjoyable. In reading a few of the other more critical reviews here I find the word ""persnickety"" comes to mind. The years 1971-1977 cover a very fertile period in the artist's life, before he began immersing himself in producing the music of others (Ultravox, Devo, U2, etc.) and creating music of the more ambient type. It was nice to take a stroll down memory lane watching this, as a wordsmith of absurdist wit and whimsy his lyrics always delighted me, and as a creator of ""sounds"" of a musical type he was assuredly an innovator. All those involved in contributing to this documentary (including guitarist Chris Spedding and esteemed music critic Robert Christgau) come across as knowledgeable, appreciative and involved. This might be officially ""unauthorized"", but it still comes across as the best to be offered thus far. There will no doubt come a day when Eno's career will end up the subject of a more all-encompassing documentary, but for now this suits me just fine.",5,Satisfying Overview,1362268800,"03 3, 2013",2013,1402,"['reading', 'few', 'other', 'contributors', 'reviews', 'felt', 'just', 'had', 'throw', 'hat', 'ring', 'was', 'enthusiastic', 'fan', 'admirer', 'Eno', 'musical', 'efforts', 'starting', '1973', 'when', 'heard', 'Baby', 'Fire', 'coming', 'airwaves', 'Canada', ""'m"", 'native', 'Detroiter', 'where', 'Eno', 'music', 'was', ""n't"", 'getting', 'airplay', 'then', 'Having', 'watched', 'documentary', 'found', 'very', 'informative', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'reading', 'few', 'other', 'more', 'critical', 'reviews', 'here', 'find', 'word', 'persnickety', 'mind', 'years', '1971-1977', 'cover', 'very', 'fertile', 'period', 'artist', 'life', 'began', 'immersing', 'producing', 'music', 'others', 'Ultravox', 'Devo', 'U2', 'etc', 'creating', 'music', 'more', 'ambient', 'type', 'was', 'nice', 'take', 'stroll', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'watching', 'wordsmith', 'absurdist', 'wit', 'whimsy', 'lyrics', 'always', 'delighted', 'creator', 'sounds', 'musical', 'type', 'was', 'assuredly', 'innovator', 'involved', 'contributing', 'documentary', 'including', 'guitarist', 'Chris', 'Spedding', 'esteemed', 'music', 'critic', 'Robert', 'Christgau', 'come', 'knowledgeable', 'appreciative', 'involved', 'might', 'be', 'officially', 'unauthorized', 'still', 'best', 'be', 'offered', 'thus', 'far', 'will', 'doubt', 'come', 'day', 'when', 'Eno', 'career', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'subject', 'more', 'all-encompassing', 'documentary', 'now', 'suits', 'just', 'fine']",N/A
1422479,A1J2LQPDI4NKRG,B004NTDF24,Kirk McElhearn,"[2, 2]","I've long been a fan of Brian Eno's varied work. From his early song albums made in the 1970s, through his ambient compositions, to his more recent experimental work and collaborations with other musicians. There is a stark difference between the sound of, say, the first two Roxy Music albums, which featured Brian Eno (Roxy Music and For Your Pleasure, and his ambient works, such as Music for Airports; and that's only looking at recordings from the 1970s.This recent DVD is a documentary about Eno's career during that period, beginning in 1971 when he started working with Roxy Music, and ending in 1977, around the time that he had finished his fourth ""song"" album, Before and After Science, one of the four classic song albums of the period, and the last album of songs he would release for some three decades.This documentary is long, at just over 2 1/2 hours, and resembles a ""director's cut"" of a 52-minute documentary. It has interviews with a number of journalists and authors, but only a handful of musicians and composers, and Eno himself only appears for about 30 seconds, in a clip from a BBC interview. The back cover of the DVD clearly states that, ""This film is not authorized or sanctioned by Brian Eno, or bay any party representing him,"" so there were obviously some issues that prevented the filmmakers from not only interviewing Eno, but also getting any footage other than the above-mentioned BBC interview, and some early Roxy Music clips, again, from BBC performances. (One criticism is the use of cheesy stock footage every time a musical excerpt is played; these videos have nothing to do with the music, and are, at best, filler.)This is an interesting documentary, and perhaps more so for someone who, like myself, is very familiar with Eno's music. It covers the Roxy Music period, the four song albums, with a special focus on Another Green World, which is arguably the best of the lot. It looks at Eno's collaboration with the German duo Cluster, his creation of Obscure Records (which released 10 LPs, with music notably by Michael Nyman, Gavin Bryars, John Adams, John Cage, The Penguin Caf&eacute; Orchestra, and Eno himself), and the earliest forays into ambient music.It's fair to say that the length of this documentary will be off-putting for those with just a passing interest in Brian Eno's music, but I suspect that such people wouldn't want to buy it anyway. So if you're a fan of Eno, this long, flawed documentary is worth buying to see a close look at Eno's earliest works.",4,Worth watching if your'e an Eno fan,1347062400,"09 8, 2012",2012,2521,"[""'ve"", 'long', 'been', 'fan', 'Brian', 'Eno', 'varied', 'work', 'early', 'song', 'albums', 'made', '1970s', 'ambient', 'compositions', 'more', 'recent', 'experimental', 'work', 'collaborations', 'other', 'musicians', 'stark', 'difference', 'sound', 'say', 'first', 'two', 'Roxy', 'Music', 'albums', 'featured', 'Brian', 'Eno', 'Roxy', 'Music', 'Your', 'Pleasure', 'ambient', 'works', 'such', 'Music', 'Airports', 'only', 'looking', 'recordings', '1970s.This', 'recent', 'DVD', 'documentary', 'Eno', 'career', 'period', 'beginning', '1971', 'when', 'started', 'working', 'Roxy', 'Music', 'ending', '1977', 'time', 'had', 'finished', 'fourth', 'song', 'album', 'Science', 'one', 'four', 'classic', 'song', 'albums', 'period', 'last', 'album', 'songs', 'would', 'release', 'three', 'decades.This', 'documentary', 'long', 'just', '2', '1/2', 'hours', 'director', 'cut', '52-minute', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'number', 'journalists', 'authors', 'only', 'handful', 'musicians', 'composers', 'Eno', 'only', '30', 'seconds', 'clip', 'BBC', 'interview', 'back', 'cover', 'DVD', 'clearly', 'film', 'not', 'authorized', 'sanctioned', 'Brian', 'Eno', 'bay', 'party', 'representing', 'were', 'obviously', 'issues', 'prevented', 'filmmakers', 'not', 'only', 'interviewing', 'Eno', 'also', 'getting', 'footage', 'other', 'above-mentioned', 'BBC', 'interview', 'early', 'Roxy', 'Music', 'clips', 'again', 'BBC', 'performances', 'One', 'criticism', 'use', 'cheesy', 'stock', 'footage', 'time', 'musical', 'excerpt', 'played', 'videos', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'music', 'are', 'best', 'filler', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'perhaps', 'more', 'so', 'someone', 'who', 'very', 'familiar', 'Eno', 'music', 'Roxy', 'Music', 'period', 'four', 'song', 'albums', 'special', 'focus', 'Green', 'World', 'arguably', 'best', 'lot', 'Eno', 'collaboration', 'German', 'duo', 'Cluster', 'creation', 'Obscure', 'Records', 'released', '10', 'LPs', 'music', 'notably', 'Michael', 'Nyman', 'Gavin', 'Bryars', 'John', 'Adams', 'John', 'Cage', 'Penguin', 'Caf', 'eacute', 'Orchestra', 'Eno', 'earliest', 'forays', 'ambient', 'music.It', 'fair', 'say', 'length', 'documentary', 'will', 'be', 'off-putting', 'just', 'passing', 'interest', 'Brian', 'Eno', 'music', 'suspect', 'such', 'people', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'buy', 'anyway', 'So', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Eno', 'long', 'flawed', 'documentary', 'worth', 'buying', 'see', 'close', 'look', 'Eno', 'earliest', 'works']",N/A
1422480,AY3IM97CPMKP6,B004NTDF24,"Kristopher Spencer ""ScoreBabyCom""","[19, 24]","While watching this earnest doc about the legendary Brian Eno I wondered why the filmmakers were unable to interview the man himself. They clearly had access to the foremost experts on Eno, but Eno is seen only once in interview, and of his many collaborators only the most obscure sat for interviews (no Bowie, no Byrne). So, while much of the information shared seems accurate enough, I can't help but think that it was a missed opportunity to get new insight into his working methods and philosophy. That said, if you're new to Eno and don't want to read the various books about him and his music, this film offers a fairly concise portrait of him during his most protean period and relies heavily on the insights of the authors of those books.",3,"A decent intro to Eno, but lacks the man himself",1306108800,"05 23, 2011",2011,747,"['watching', 'earnest', 'doc', 'legendary', 'Brian', 'Eno', 'wondered', 'why', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'unable', 'interview', 'man', 'clearly', 'had', 'access', 'foremost', 'experts', 'Eno', 'Eno', 'seen', 'only', 'once', 'interview', 'many', 'collaborators', 'only', 'most', 'obscure', 'sat', 'interviews', 'Bowie', 'Byrne', 'So', 'much', 'information', 'shared', 'accurate', 'enough', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'was', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'get', 'new', 'insight', 'working', 'methods', 'philosophy', 'said', ""'re"", 'new', 'Eno', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'read', 'various', 'books', 'music', 'film', 'fairly', 'concise', 'portrait', 'most', 'protean', 'period', 'relies', 'heavily', 'insights', 'authors', 'books']",N/A
