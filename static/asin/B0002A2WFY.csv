829147,A74CIFZOL7QEF,B0002A2WFY,"A. Hamilton ""Ace Hamilton""","[4, 8]","The real problem with these new Stooges releases is that Columbia has used the excuse of the colorization to present only four shorts, some of which have been released on other DVDs previously.  Furthermore these retail for 24.99 while most others containing more shorts retail for 19.99 so we are asked to pay more for less.  I bought both of them used for under $10 each and suggest you look for them used if you must have them.  I have already seen many used copies in stores, probably because there are many disappointed buyers.  Advantages of buying used: you'll pay less and Columbia won't make any money off the sale.  The sad fact is that if these sell well enough this is all we can expect in the future.As for the colorization: it may be the best I've seen, which is still pretty awful.  Very unrealistic hues, jarring color combinations, unpleasant pastels.  If you know anything about film you'll know that if the filmmakers had made these in color they would not have looked anything like this. What is the point of researching what the actual color of a prop was on Ebay (see the self-congratulatory featurette)?  The props and costumes were chosen for how they would photograph in black and white.  They would have done better to just try and make everything look as natural as possible.I can't help thinking the choice of the stooges for launching this new colorization line is an odd one.  If there is any B&W; material that seems almost immune to the objections of people who won't watch black and white it's the stooges.  My five-year-old daughter loves the stooges in black and white and so do many people who refuse to watch B&W; movies.In summary because of the colorization we get less entertainment.But if you find color more important than laughs, this disc is for you.",1,Fewer shorts for more money!,1093824000,"08 30, 2004",2004,1794,"['real', 'problem', 'new', 'Stooges', 'Columbia', 'used', 'excuse', 'colorization', 'present', 'only', 'four', 'shorts', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'other', 'DVDs', 'previously', 'retail', '24.99', 'most', 'others', 'containing', 'more', 'shorts', 'retail', '19.99', 'are', 'asked', 'pay', 'more', 'less', 'bought', 'used', '10', 'suggest', 'look', 'used', 'must', 'have', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'many', 'used', 'copies', 'stores', 'probably', 'are', 'many', 'disappointed', 'buyers', 'Advantages', 'buying', 'used', ""'ll"", 'pay', 'less', 'Columbia', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'money', 'sale', 'sad', 'fact', 'sell', 'well', 'enough', 'can', 'expect', 'future.As', 'colorization', 'may', 'be', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'still', 'pretty', 'awful', 'Very', 'unrealistic', 'hues', 'jarring', 'color', 'combinations', 'unpleasant', 'pastels', 'know', 'anything', 'film', ""'ll"", 'know', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'made', 'color', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'looked', 'anything', 'What', 'point', 'researching', 'what', 'actual', 'color', 'prop', 'was', 'Ebay', 'see', 'self-congratulatory', 'featurette', 'props', 'costumes', 'were', 'chosen', 'how', 'would', 'photograph', 'black', 'white', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'just', 'try', 'make', 'everything', 'look', 'as', 'natural', 'possible.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'choice', 'stooges', 'launching', 'new', 'colorization', 'line', 'odd', 'one', 'B', 'W', 'material', 'almost', 'immune', 'objections', 'people', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'black', 'white', 'stooges', 'five-year-old', 'daughter', 'stooges', 'black', 'white', 'so', 'do', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'refuse', 'watch', 'B', 'W', 'summary', 'colorization', 'get', 'less', 'entertainment.But', 'find', 'color', 'more', 'important', 'laughs', 'disc']",The Three Stooges: Goofs on the Loose
829148,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B0002A2WFY,Anyechka,"[0, 0]","Who are the executives at Columbia who seriously thought that this would be a good idea?  Fans of classic film sent the powers that be a message in the Eighties that they hated colorisation, and after the issue was seemingly dead and buried, it rears its ugly head again in a new generation.  The Chroma Color (from what I saw of it on the self-congratulatory featurette) does look better than the colorisation of the Eighties, but that's still not saying very much.  It might look better and more realistic, but it still looks fake and distracting.  And even if it did look totally natural and lifelike, it just doesn't feel right.  Some people you can only ever picture in black and white; to imagine the Stooges in color (apart from a handful of films they made that were actually originally shot in Technicolor) would just seem wrong.  These shorts were shot in black and white and have been enjoyed in black and white for over 70 years now.  The technicians can do all of the research they want on what types of colors these things might have been, but it's still missing a big point--the colors that were actually chosen were chosen precisely because of how they would register on black and white film stock.  The colors used certainly wouldn't have looked anything like what they actually do in Chroma Color.  Frankly, the only reason I even rented this disc was because I hadn't yet seen 'Playing the Ponies' or 'The Sitter-Downers.'This disc also has the misfortune of only having two previously unreleased shorts.  It's great that one at least has the option of viewing them in B&W; or color (and there is a ""Play All"" button, something that was absent on almost all of the previous discs), but it's not great at all that the consumer is basically being asked to pay much more money for something that only has two new-to-DVD shorts.  'Men in Black' and 'Punch Drunks' were already released on the 'Curly Classics' disc.  Including both the B&W; and colorised versions, there are 8 shorts on this disc; if only they could have been 8 shorts that hadn't been released on DVD prior instead of consisting of two rehashes.  And come on, only 4 shorts on a disc, regardless of how many had already been released?The shorts themselves are somewhat of a mixed bag.  'Punch Drunks' (1934), their second Columbia short and the only one they got credit for writing themselves, is a classic, even though they hadn't really ironed out their comedy style, their screen personae, or their screen relationship yet.  If only this and not 'Woman Haters' had been their first short, since it has the three of them meeting one another for the first time in the opening scenes and starts to establish their characters and relationship.'Men in Black' (1934) I personally find to be kind of overrated.  It is rather memorable, but more because of what an odd short it is, not because it's fall-down hilarious or contains a lot of classic lines and routines.  It seems like a lot of their early shorts have been declared classics only because they were done so early in their tenure at Columbia, and not for any more substantial reasons.  Seriously, would this short be considered such a great classic had it been made in, say, 1940 or 1938?  Still, as strange as this short may be, at least it's nowhere near the likes of 'Horsing Around' or 'Rumpus in a Harem.''Playing the Ponies' (1937) has some fun stuff in it, but overall I didn't find it to be so hot.  This short got a one-star rating in 'The Three Stooges Scrapbook,' though I wouldn't give it such a poor rating myself.  (This is also the same book that gives 3-star ratings to the likes of 'Sweet and Hot,' 'Hoofs and Goofs,' and 'Fling in the Ring'!)  This is a cute fun short, but overall it's not one of their classics.  I'd consider it a bit below average.'The Sitter-Downers' (1937), which stars Ted Healy's sister Marcia as Cora Belle, could perhaps be viewed as the short in which they entered into their golden era.  There's a lot of great stuff in this one, and even though the premise of trying to build a house had been done before (by Buster Keaton in 'One Week' and by Laurel and Hardy in 'The Finishing Touch'), it doesn't seem like an old and tired situation.  The possibilities for comedic mayhem are endless when carpentry is involved!  The concept of sit-down strikes was also something that would have hit the original audience very close to home, as they were all over the news that year.  The ending is somewhat abrupt, but everything that went before was so great that it doesn't really matter.This is not a collection I would recommend getting, even considering that one does have the option of watching them in B&W; only.  Though the overall quality of the shorts is pretty decent, there are still only 4 shorts, and half of them have been issued before.  It's ridiculous that someone actually thought this would sell well and generate a lot of interest instead of indifference and anger.",3,No wonder it didn't sell well,1156377600,"08 24,

829151,ABAZFH25304ZG,B0002A2WFY,John M Spangler,"[9, 9]","I may be a numbskull, but I love these collections!!! I notice some people really don't like the idea of color for the stooges.  But being a true fan of stooge-mania, there is really a lot to like. These 4 amazing shorts look spectacular and I've never seen any stooges short look better, either on DVD or the old VHS tapes that I own. The picture is crisp and there is little if any distortions between the four twenty minute shorts. Even more amazing, all have also been colorized with the power of computer technology and it looks quite amazing, was this filmed in 05?? Wow! The 4 shorts, all from the 30's druing the prime time of the stooges era (All Curly), are of unmatched quality.  Columbia painstakingly removed the scratches and blemishes that have progressed throughout the years and they got a hold of the original prints and touched them up to boot.The color factor of the collection is the main selling point, and although Columbia got a bit lazy as 4 shorts may seems pretty skimpy (about 60 minutes),but seeing them in color and the remastered original prints look is worth your hard earned dough. Some feel the color seems fake or washed out, but I personally love the color addition. It really makes you feel like the short was filmed in color.  It doesn't look too synthetic or fake, the realistic color with skin tones, color backdrops and every thread of clothing is a site to behold. Some shorts look better than others, the indoor scenes seem to suffer the most, but when they're outside, it seems to look more natural. When you view the shorts, take a close look at the trees, it's amazing how a computer can bring the color to life. At times I thought the skin tones of the stooges was a bit off at parts, they sometimes have a sunkist orangy tint, but considering the age of these shorts, what is not to like? Don't want to bother with the color? No problem. With the press of the ""angle"" button on your remote, you can instantly go back to the remastered black and white originals.The shorts are all during the prime years of the stooges when they are all at their best. Playing the Ponies was never released on DVD before and was a nice inclusion. Curly has more time on the short and is well deserved for sure. Men in Black, one of their first shorts which was nominated for an Oscar, is one of Curly's best performances. The Sitter Downers contains enough slapping and bashing of Larry and Curly to do most stooges fans in, Moe really lays into them and the smacking and eye-poking and is as funny as ever. Pop Goes The Weasel, a bit of a take off of the other future (boxing/wrestling) short called Grips, Grunts and Groans (1937), is a short that was never released on VHS and a rare find for stooge fans. One mentioned the fact that this short was censored or edited out, I 100% guarantee it is uncut and very uncouth, you won't be disappointed. The ending sequence he was referring to that was left out was regarding ""Grips Grunts and Groans"" which was released later in the 30's.I seriously like what Columbia is doing. They want to give us the best possible Stooge collection and this is a good start. The shorts really are remastered and being a fan of the stooges for 20 years, I can honestly say I've never seen a single short look better than these four. One can say Columbia is just out for a  quick buck to re-release the shorts and claim they look better, but believe me when I say, they seriously do look better. The colorized versions are very well done and they were painstakingly conceived by some real savvy people and computers. I hope the two DVD's offered are not the last, as I would love to have every stooge short ever made (remastered) and in color on DVD. If it takes years to have this accomoplished, I would be willing to wait. Well worth your dough if you're a fan especially if you want the absolute best.

MCCOSKER,"[11, 14]","The Stooges are great, but the core of their achievement -- the approximately two hundred comedy shorts they did for Columbia -- has never gotten anything remotely approaching the respect it or its fans deserve. This latest piece of junk adds yet more insult to injury.A one-sided DVD will hold at least thirteen Stooges shorts, but Columbia, when it sporadically decides to knock out a new one, only includes five to eight shorts. Until now, that is.This latest disgrace only has four shorts. You read that right -- less than a third of what it could hold, out of some 200 shorts in the Columbia vaults. And at least one of the four -- ""Men in Black"" -- is already out on an earlier-released Stooges DVD collection (*Curly Classics*).The nyuk-nyuks are on us consumers, apparently.Naturally, given Columbia's bent, it's charging more than ever. Pay more for less value, in other words. That should be Columbia's motto.Oh, that's right: These are colorized. Like the Stooges really need that.New and improved colorization, supposedly. There's even a little ""featurette"" trying to sell us on the colorization (when what consumers really want are a lot more Stooges shorts released, with far more shorts per disc and more reasonable prices). Colorization, we're assured, has made great technical strides since the old controversy about it in the '80s.Let *me* assure you: *This* colorization job looks as bad as ever. Nothing looks real, and everybody's skin has that ghastly orangey washed-over look.Fortunately, the colorization effect can be turned off. But not the distracting icon that's on the lower right corner of every frame of the Stooges shorts. Presumably this is to discourage piracy: But, if so, how do thousands of new movie and television DVDs get released without them? Why are Stooges fans singled out to suffer them?The bottom line is that this is yet another example of Columbia's gross disrespect for both its products and its customers.I'd gladly pay hundreds of dollars for thoughtfully released DVDs of the complete Stooges Columbia shorts: circa 13 shorts to a disc, lost scenes restored (another notorious failure so far by Columbia), no repetitions of shorts from disc to disc (the greed of these cheaters is illimitable), and, hopefully, some meaningful chronological order (by release dates or, better still, production sequence).Not that I'm holding my breath.For now, I'm just renting these Stooges DVDs on a one-time-only basis for myself and my children. I wouldn't dream of buying any of them given Columbia's greedy and insulting marketing schemes. Columbia won't get my money, and I hope it doesn't get yours.And it shouldn't get any of our money until it finally decides to do right by the work and the fans of the Stooges -- and market those 200 classic shorts with some shred of decency.",1,More sucker-bait for Stooges fans,1139702400,"02 12, 2006",2006,2824,"['Stooges', 'are', 'great', 'core', 'achievement', 'approximately', 'two', 'hundred', 'comedy', 'shorts', 'did', 'Columbia', 'never', 'gotten', 'anything', 'remotely', 'approaching', 'respect', 'fans', 'deserve', 'latest', 'piece', 'junk', 'yet', 'more', 'insult', 'injury.A', 'one-sided', 'DVD', 'will', 'hold', 'least', 'thirteen', 'Stooges', 'shorts', 'Columbia', 'when', 'sporadically', 'knock', 'out', 'new', 'one', 'only', 'five', 'eight', 'shorts', 'now', 'is.This', 'latest', 'disgrace', 'only', 'four', 'shorts', 'read', 'right', 'less', 'third', 'what', 'could', 'hold', '200', 'shorts', 'Columbia', 'vaults', 'least', 'one', 'four', 'Men', 'Black', 'already', 'out', 'earlier-released', 'Stooges', 'DVD', 'collection', '*Curly', 'Classics*', 'nyuk-nyuks', 'are', 'consumers', 'apparently.Naturally', 'given', 'Columbia', 'bent', 'charging', 'more', 'ever', 'Pay', 'more', 'less', 'value', 'other', 'words', 'should', 'be', 'Columbia', 'motto.Oh', 'right', 'are', 'colorized', 'Stooges', 'really', 'need', 'that.New', 'improved', 'colorization', 'supposedly', 'even', 'little', 'featurette', 'trying', 'sell', 'colorization', 'when', 'what', 'consumers', 'really', 'want', 'are', 'lot', 'more', 'Stooges', 'shorts', 'released', 'far', 'more', 'shorts', 'disc', 'more', 'reasonable', 'prices', 'Colorization', ""'re"", 'assured', 'made', 'great', 'technical', 'strides', 'old', 'controversy', ""'80s.Let"", '*me*', 'assure', '*This*', 'colorization', 'job', 'as', 'bad', 'ever', 'Nothing', 'real', 'everybody', 'skin', 'ghastly', 'washed-over', 'look.Fortunately', 'colorization', 'effect', 'can', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'not', 'distracting', 'icon', 'lower', 'right', 'corner', 'frame', 'Stooges', 'shorts', 'Presumably', 'discourage', 'piracy', 'so', 'how', 'do', 'thousands', 'new', 'movie', 'television', 'DVDs', 'get', 'released', 'Why', 'are', 'Stooges', 'fans', 'singled', 'out', 'suffer', 'bottom', 'line', 'yet', 'example', 'Columbia', 'gross', 'disrespect', 'products', 'customers.I', ""'d"", 'gladly', 'pay', 'hundreds', 'dollars', 'thoughtfully', 'released', 'DVDs', 'complete', 'Stooges', 'Columbia', 'shorts', 'circa', '13', 'shorts', 'disc', 'lost', 'scenes', 'restored', 'notorious', 'failure', 'so', 'far', 'Columbia', 'repetitions', 'shorts', 'disc', 'disc', 'greed', 'cheaters', 'illimitable', 'hopefully', 'meaningful', 'chronological', 'order', 'release', 'dates', 'better', 'still', 'production', 'sequence', ""'m"", 'holding', 'breath.For', 'now', ""'m"", 'just', 'renting', 'Stooges', 'DVDs', 'one-time-only', 'basis', 'myself', 'children', 'would', ""n't"", 'dream', 'buying', 'given', 'Columbia', 'greedy', 'insulting', 'marketing', 'schemes', 'Columbia', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'money', 'hope', ""n't"", 'get', 'yours.And', 'should', ""n't"", 'get', 'money', 'finally', 'do', 'right', 'work', 'fans', 'Stooges', 'market', '200', 'classic', 'shorts', 'shred', 'decency']",The Three Stooges: Goofs on the Loose

During ""punch drunks"" what is up with the line down the middle of the screen , If you have a plasma you will see every artifact , which i would be able to live with being that there 70 years old BUT If you remastered them you can remove a line, That is unbearable to watch and second some dvd players show this blue movie camera in the top right hand corner . My old Toshiba did not , My new Samsung with HDMI does . I cant watch them that way . So I'm returning the player for a new Panasonic HDMI in hopes that it will remove the camera . As for the artifacts and the missing scenes of the shorts . Columbia , You blanked the stooges and now you blanked the fans . Worst movie company in the history of TV . I do not agree with most saying the color is bad , I think that is one of the best parts and if you don't like it switch it to B/W . Who cares how much if they were done right the Stooges are priceless but for edited and un-restored versions I don't think i will ever buy anymore till some new company buys them out. They would sell anything for money cause that's all they care about and I'm sure there are other motion picture companies that would do justice to the Stooges , Till then Screw Columbia . !!!

The ""new"" color is absolutely dazzling---quite an incredible technical accomplishment.These four episodes contain some of the most classic Stooge gags ever.  ""Punch Drinks"" was actually written by the Stooges, and all three are prominently featured, including Larry with his actual violin playing, and then his scrambling through town to locate music to help Curly defeat his boxing opponent [""that weasel tune""], as the music gives him unbeatable strength.  ""Playing The Ponies"" is one of the all-time cleverest Stooge features: Curly cooking up hilarious fun in the restaurant kitchen, Larry constantly getting frustrated (by Moe, of course) when he tries to pilfer a few cents from the till, and that entire, hilarious horse race-- hot pepper, speed-induced, water-chasing sequence.  In their Academy Award nominated ""Men In Black,"" the Stooges play medical interns at Los Arms Hospital, and we learn that they graduated med school with the highest temperatures in their class!  [Some class!]  ""For duty and humanity!""  ""The Sitter Downers,"" the weakest of these episodes, still has some very clever gags and funny moments, as the guys play newlyweds who get a free house (which they have to put together, with hilarious and disastrous results).If you think you would enjoy the Stooges in color (again, very effectively done), and remember these episodes fondly (all with Curly at his very best, along with great contributions from Moe AND Larry), or are just curious, grab this collection QUICK!  As a side note, I would like to add that, in my opinion, the treatment of the legacy and the product has been reverent in creating these exciting color episodes.
