1179559,A3N95R1VKWROWF,B001D7T6AE,Christopher Schwinger,"[0, 0]","I always loved watching the Berenstain Bears' Christmas tree special on video in childhood, and I still love it just as much.  I think a lot of the appeal of the Berenstain Bears cartoons for me is the corniness of the characterizations--Papa the clown who's clumsy and out of touch with reality, Mama the practical disciplinarian with a mellifluous voice and who always has answers, Brother the regular boy, Sister the regular girl.  I find their voices, faces, and activities simply hilarious--I'm not sure whether I think they're dumb, truly appealing, or both.  The voices of Papa Bear and some characters outside of the family are really funny.  Reading the books didn't make me laugh, but watching the cartoons does!The 25-minute Christmas tree special from 1979, which is the highlight of this DVD, is funny especially when Papa Bear goes crazy as he's looking for the biggest Christmas tree he can find, heedless of the snowy weather and creatures who don't like their trees axed down.  Papa Bear's change of heart, realizing that what he calls ""Christmas trees"" are homes to other creatures, is unforgettable and contains a suspenseful buildup.  I hadn't seen the Christmas tree special in probably 15 years, and I remembered Papa Bear's song and that turning point really well. Probably because of ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"", the Christmas tree special is done in rhyme.  This DVD also has four 10-minute episodes from the 1980s TV show.",5,"Great Christmas tree special, with 4 additional funny cartoons",1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,1453,"['always', 'loved', 'watching', 'Berenstain', 'Bears', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'special', 'video', 'childhood', 'still', 'love', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'think', 'lot', 'appeal', 'Berenstain', 'Bears', 'cartoons', 'corniness', 'characterizations', 'Papa', 'clown', 'who', 'clumsy', 'touch', 'reality', 'Mama', 'practical', 'disciplinarian', 'mellifluous', 'voice', 'who', 'always', 'answers', 'Brother', 'regular', 'boy', 'Sister', 'regular', 'girl', 'find', 'voices', 'activities', 'simply', 'hilarious', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'think', ""'re"", 'dumb', 'truly', 'appealing', 'voices', 'Papa', 'Bear', 'characters', 'family', 'are', 'really', 'funny', 'Reading', 'books', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'laugh', 'watching', 'cartoons', '25-minute', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'special', '1979', 'highlight', 'DVD', 'funny', 'especially', 'when', 'Papa', 'Bear', 'crazy', 'looking', 'biggest', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'can', 'find', 'heedless', 'snowy', 'weather', 'creatures', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'trees', 'axed', 'down', 'Papa', 'Bear', 'change', 'heart', 'realizing', 'what', 'Christmas', 'trees', 'are', 'homes', 'other', 'creatures', 'unforgettable', 'suspenseful', 'buildup', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'special', 'probably', '15', 'years', 'remembered', 'Papa', 'Bear', 'song', 'turning', 'point', 'really', 'well', 'Probably', 'How', 'Grinch', 'Stole', 'Christmas', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'special', 'done', 'rhyme', 'DVD', 'also', 'four', '10-minute', 'episodes', '1980s', 'TV', 'show']",N/A

One of the few I was missing was the Bernstein Bears Christmas tree (which my mother taped off TV on BETA!). It was always a favorite of mine with the plastic pink '18-pointed' star, the snowbirds, Grizzly Gus' tree lot and Papa Bear's single minded vision of the perfect tree.And this DVD is the complete, 80s-fantastic classic. (Don't be fooled by the 'newer' art on the cover) It's everything I remember. Also included are a few classic episodes (Trouble with Strangers, Forget their Manners, Stage Fright and Ice Monster (which I'd never seen)).
