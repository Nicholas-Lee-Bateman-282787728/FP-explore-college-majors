I still scramble to get through his sun salutations, but hopefully eventually will be able to do them smoothly.  I like that he includes modifications and is so encouraging.As others have noted, there isn't anything fancy about the production of this dvd-no fancy scenery, music, models, etc.He emphasizes the breathe and the bandhas which is nice, but still things I'm working towards.I think this gives a person a lot to work on and is a great value.",5,"Traditional, Bare Bones Yoga",1312502400,"08 5, 2011",2011,558,"['like', 'how', 'clear', 'David', 'Swenson', 'descriptions', 'are', 'like', 'detailed', 'introduction', 'beginning', 'still', 'scramble', 'get', 'sun', 'salutations', 'hopefully', 'eventually', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'smoothly', 'like', 'modifications', 'so', 'encouraging.As', 'others', 'have', 'noted', ""n't"", 'anything', 'fancy', 'production', 'dvd-no', 'fancy', 'scenery', 'music', 'models', 'etc.He', 'breathe', 'bandhas', 'nice', 'still', 'things', ""'m"", 'working', 'towards.I', 'think', 'person', 'lot', 'work', 'great', 'value']",N/A
195494,A1GW7V6S6XSXX3,1891252143,Christopher Mayo,"[6, 6]","Ashtanga Yoga: The Practice, First Series by David Swenson is one of my favorite DVDs. I think I actually view it more often than any of the movies / tv series I have purchased!David leads you through the sequences with detailed explanations and flawless movements. It feels very meditative to follow his instructions and work through the Ashtanga series. And, his practice is so beautiful you almost wonder if he is using wires or computer graphics to move so well. It is a quality DVD that is well worth the investment.You might want to also think about purchasing his book to go along with the DVD (ASHTANGA YOGA: THE PRACTICE MANUAL ; AN ILLUSTRATED GUIDE TO PERSONAL PRACTICE. The Primary & Intermediate Series plus Three Short Forms). It's certainly not necessary, but there are lots of explanations in it, and because it is spiral-bound, you can use it during your practice.I have several yoga DVDs, but this one and John Scott'sAshtanga Yoga Primary Series with John Scott DVDare the two that I keep coming back to. The DVDs are probably best used to supplement practice in classes with a trained instructor, but I think even a beginner without any knowledge of yoga could enjoy it.",5,One of My Favorite DVDs,1278374400,"07 6, 2010",2010,1190,"['Ashtanga', 'Yoga', 'Practice', 'First', 'Series', 'David', 'Swenson', 'one', 'favorite', 'DVDs', 'think', 'actually', 'view', 'more', 'often', 'movies', '/', 'tv', 'series', 'have', 'purchased', 'David', 'sequences', 'detailed', 'explanations', 'flawless', 'movements', 'very', 'meditative', 'follow', 'instructions', 'work', 'Ashtanga', 'series', 'practice', 'so', 'beautiful', 'almost', 'wonder', 'using', 'wires', 'computer', 'graphics', 'move', 'so', 'well', 'quality', 'DVD', 'well', 'investment.You', 'might', 'want', 'also', 'think', 'purchasing', 'book', 'go', 'along', 'DVD', 'ASHTANGA', 'YOGA', 'PRACTICE', 'MANUAL', 'AN', 'ILLUSTRATED', 'GUIDE', 'TO', 'PERSONAL', 'PRACTICE', 'Primary', 'Intermediate', 'Series', 'Three', 'Short', 'Forms', 'certainly', 'not', 'necessary', 'are', 'lots', 'explanations', 'spiral-bound', 'can', 'use', 'practice.I', 'have', 'several', 'yoga', 'DVDs', 'one', 'John', ""Scott'sAshtanga"", 'Yoga', 'Primary', 'Series', 'John', 'Scott', 'DVDare', 'two', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'DVDs', 'are', 'probably', 'best', 'used', 'supplement', 'practice', 'classes', 'trained', 'instructor', 'think', 'even', 'beginner', 'knowledge', 'yoga', 'could', 'enjoy']",N/A

195496,A1NO74JFBLP9PO,1891252143,Observer,"[91, 98]","This is a DVD of the Ashtanga Primary Series targeted to those who already do, or are already in the process of studying, the practice. (If you are unfamiliar with Ashtanga don't let the word ""primary"" fool you: this is a serious and challenging workout).Ashtanga is a set series of poses (ie the same poses every time). It is an active, moving type of yoga. You get very hot and sweaty as you simultaniously build strength and flexiblity.Ashtanga is a daily practice and should be learned from a competent teacher. If you are studying Ashtanga and can't make it to class every day this DVD is an excellent way to practice at home to supplement your time in class. But a live teacher is essential to make sure you are doing the practice correctly.IF YOU ARE A YOGA BEGINNER OR NOVICE THIS DVD IS NOT TARGETED TO YOU (so please don't complain that it is too hard, too fast or lacks explanation). This is NOT meant to be a step-by-step intro to yoga in general or Ashtanga specifically.It is an excellent DVD for those with Ashtanga experience who want to do a ""led primary series"". Or for those who are wondering what a full-fledged Ashtanga practice looks like.But, if you are starting out, this is not a detailed instructional video on how to do each pose. It is a quickly moving, ""led primary series"" (and if you don't know what that means this DVD is probably not for you...yet anyway).",5,"This is Ashtanga, the original Power Yoga",1203724800,"02 23, 2008",2008,1389,"['DVD', 'Ashtanga', 'Primary', 'Series', 'targeted', 'who', 'already', 'do', 'are', 'already', 'process', 'studying', 'practice', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'Ashtanga', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'word', 'primary', 'fool', 'serious', 'challenging', 'workout', '.Ashtanga', 'set', 'series', 'poses', 'ie', 'same', 'time', 'active', 'moving', 'type', 'yoga', 'get', 'very', 'hot', 'sweaty', 'simultaniously', 'build', 'strength', 'flexiblity.Ashtanga', 'daily', 'practice', 'should', 'be', 'learned', 'competent', 'teacher', 'are', 'studying', 'Ashtanga', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'class', 'day', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'way', 'practice', 'home', 'supplement', 'time', 'class', 'live', 'teacher', 'essential', 'make', 'sure', 'are', 'doing', 'practice', 'correctly.IF', 'YOU', 'ARE', 'A', 'YOGA', 'BEGINNER', 'OR', 'NOVICE', 'THIS', 'DVD', 'IS', 'NOT', 'TARGETED', 'TO', 'YOU', 'so', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'complain', 'too', 'hard', 'too', 'fast', 'explanation', 'NOT', 'meant', 'be', 'step-by-step', 'intro', 'yoga', 'general', 'Ashtanga', 'specifically.It', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'Ashtanga', 'experience', 'who', 'want', 'do', 'led', 'primary', 'series', 'who', 'are', 'wondering', 'what', 'full-fledged', 'Ashtanga', 'practice', 'like.But', 'are', 'starting', 'out', 'not', 'detailed', 'instructional', 'video', 'how', 'do', 'pose', 'quickly', 'moving', 'led', 'primary', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'DVD', 'probably', 'not', 'yet', 'anyway']",N/A

Now thats very important to remember while practicing Ashtanga as it is all too easy to get caught into the flow of the sequence and keep pushing yourself over the edge. In fact given how tranquilizing the sequence is, you may not even know when you have pushed yourself  too hard- till its too late that is. I absolutely love the Ashtanga sequence, however as someone in her late 30s, I have to keep reminding myself that I may never be able to reach the advanced poses like David. I am really glad that David keeps reminding me of the different options. Of course after a good primary series workout- I feel as if I'd had a day at the Spa- so alive and yet so relaxed- thats just the beauty of the sequence.",5,"Great instructions, great practice",1241222400,"05 2, 2009",2009,828,"['David', 'Swenson', 'uniquely', 'gentle', 'soothing', 'voice', 'constantly', 'reminding', 'not', 'push', 'too', 'hard', 'Now', 'very', 'important', 'remember', 'practicing', 'Ashtanga', 'too', 'easy', 'get', 'caught', 'flow', 'sequence', 'keep', 'pushing', 'edge', 'fact', 'given', 'how', 'tranquilizing', 'sequence', 'may', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'when', 'have', 'pushed', 'too', 'hard-', 'till', 'too', 'late', 'absolutely', 'love', 'Ashtanga', 'sequence', 'however', 'someone', 'late', '30s', 'have', 'keep', 'reminding', 'may', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'reach', 'advanced', 'poses', 'David', 'am', 'really', 'glad', 'David', 'reminding', 'different', 'options', 'course', 'good', 'primary', 'series', 'workout-', 'feel', ""'d"", 'had', 'day', 'Spa-', 'alive', 'yet', 'so', 'relaxed-', 'thats', 'just', 'beauty', 'sequence']",N/A
