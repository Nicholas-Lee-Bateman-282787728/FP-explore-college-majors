1116992,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000YAA68W,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[9, 9]","Forget your stereotypes of Iranians. `Persepolis' is an engagingly funny, sad, and poignant look at Merjane (Margie) (Chiara Mastrorianni) a girl who grows up in Tehran during the 1980's.  Despite our possible preconceptions, Merjane surprisingly sports addidas sneakers, eats French fries, and yearns to shave her legs.  The movie provides an absorbing history lesson, showing us the close up ramifications of people's lives behind the headlines, and tells a captivating story about a girl trying to belong and survive under dire circumstances.Until all the world changing events, Merjane lets us know, ""I led a peaceful, uneventful life as a child.""  Within the family, Merjan's uncle is kindly, yet communist.  He's probably seen enough dictatorships and knows of only one way out.  His ordeal is documented well enough.  The most supportive in the family is Merjane's grandmother (Daniell Darrieux), whose affection and wisdom go a long way.  Her parents (Catherine Deneuve and Simon Abkarian) are also good people who yearn for freedom, but know how to keep Merjane's best interests above their own.During the time, we get a first person perspective on the Shah of Iran, his rise to power, the unrest that led to his exile, and his subsequent replacement by Ayatolla Kohmeni while Saddam Hussein rose to power in Iraq.  From the narrative and the played out scenes, we get the pedestrian view of how these events came into fruition and their implications in everyday lives.  Later, the Iran-Iraq War is particularly unsettling for her entire country.  For her safety, Merjan flees her country and settles into Austria where she develops not so close friendships with the ""Out"" group, seeking refuge in the punk rock/alternative scene.  With Merjane telling her story we get an intimate and often comic take on the angst of adolescence as well as what it's like to be a foreigner who's mostly misunderstood or ignored.  She returns to her own country and her family, but the changes have made her an alien in her own neighborhood.  Knowing the origin of this film, you can probably guess what happens next...The animation is unique and interesting.  Reminded that this film garnered a nomination for Best Animated Movie Oscar*, the extras show the French artists creating the film one frame (or picture) at a time.  Done mostly in black and white, the backgrounds are stylish, but mostly stagnant with the characters remaining flowing for every scene.  Oddly, it is only during the transportation scenes (like when she's waiting at the airport) when we are given the full color treatment.  Inevitably, it must be that hope colors her consciousness every time there's a new transition in her life.  I have one objection:  I didn't like all the body fluids presented.  I thought they kept it real enough without having to show all of that.  Ironically, the blood made a difference.  We need it as evidence; it provides an unflinching detail of the ordeal(s) at hand and respects all the people involved.Our funny bones are tickled several times as our colorful rebel resorts to splendid retorts to zealous extremists (""Girls who reveal themselves will burn in hell,"" says one educator), and we are served some truly funny thoughts about her body changes during puberty and the fallout of dating.  'Persepolis' has many simple joys entailed upon its viewing:  A fascinating first-person history lesson, an absorbing story, and a splendid protagonist.(Not since Art Spiegelman's groundbreaking 'Maus' have I seen a similar graphic novel treatment give this much of a wollop.)*`Ratatouille' won the Oscar for Best Animated Film from 2007.",4,"""Bear the Unbearable""",1214956800,"07 2, 2008",2008,3637,"['Forget', 'stereotypes', 'Iranians', 'Persepolis', 'engagingly', 'funny', 'sad', 'poignant', 'look', 'Merjane', 'Margie', 'Chiara', 'Mastrorianni', 'girl', 'who', 'up', 'Tehran', '1980', 'possible', 'preconceptions', 'Merjane', 'surprisingly', 'sports', 'sneakers', 'eats', 'French', 'fries', 'yearns', 'shave', 'legs', 'movie', 'absorbing', 'history', 'lesson', 'showing', 'close', 'up', 'ramifications', 'people', 'lives', 'headlines', 'captivating', 'story', 'girl', 'trying', 'belong', 'survive', 'dire', 'circumstances.Until', 'world', 'changing', 'events', 'Merjane', 'know', 'led', 'peaceful', 'uneventful', 'life', 'child', 'family', 'Merjan', 'uncle', 'kindly', 'yet', 'communist', 'probably', 'seen', 'enough', 'dictatorships', 'knows', 'only', 'one', 'way', 'ordeal', 'documented', 'well', 'enough', 'most', 'supportive', 'family', 'Merjane', 'grandmother', 'Daniell', 'Darrieux', 'affection', 'wisdom', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'parents', 'Catherine', 'Deneuve', 'Simon', 'Abkarian', 'are', 'also', 'good', 'people', 'who', 'yearn', 'freedom', 'know', 'how', 'keep', 'Merjane', 'best', 'interests', 'own.During', 'time', 'get', 'first', 'person', 'perspective', 'Shah', 'Iran', 'rise', 'power', 'unrest', 'led', 'exile', 'subsequent', 'replacement', 'Ayatolla', 'Kohmeni', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'rose', 'power', 'Iraq', 'narrative', 'played', 'out', 'scenes', 'get', 'pedestrian', 'view', 'how', 'events', 'came', 'fruition', 'implications', 'everyday', 'lives', 'Later', 'Iran-Iraq', 'War', 'particularly', 'unsettling', 'entire', 'country', 'safety', 'Merjan', 'country', 'settles', 'Austria', 'where', 'not', 'so', 'close', 'friendships', 'Out', 'group', 'seeking', 'refuge', 'punk', 'rock/alternative', 'scene', 'Merjane', 'telling', 'story', 'get', 'intimate', 'often', 'comic', 'take', 'angst', 'adolescence', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'be', 'foreigner', 'who', 'mostly', 'misunderstood', 'ignored', 'own', 'country', 'family', 'changes', 'have', 'made', 'alien', 'own', 'neighborhood', 'Knowing', 'origin', 'film', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'what', 'next', 'animation', 'unique', 'interesting', 'Reminded', 'film', 'garnered', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Animated', 'Movie', 'Oscar*', 'extras', 'show', 'French', 'artists', 'creating', 'film', 'one', 'frame', 'picture', 'time', 'Done', 'mostly', 'black', 'white', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'stylish', 'mostly', 'stagnant', 'characters', 'remaining', 'flowing', 'scene', 'Oddly', 'only', 'transportation', 'scenes', 'when', 'waiting', 'airport', 'when', 'are', 'given', 'full', 'color', 'treatment', 'Inevitably', 'must', 'be', 'hope', 'colors', 'consciousness', 'time', 'new', 'transition', 'life', 'have', 'one', 'objection', 'did', ""n't"", 'body', 'fluids', 'presented', 'thought', 'kept', 'real', 'enough', 'having', 'show', 'Ironically', 'blood', 'made', 'difference', 'need', 'evidence', 'unflinching', 'detail', 'ordeal', 'hand', 'people', 'involved.Our', 'funny', 'bones', 'are', 'tickled', 'several', 'times', 'colorful', 'rebel', 'resorts', 'splendid', 'retorts', 'zealous', 'extremists', 'Girls', 'who', 'reveal', 'will', 'burn', 'hell', 'one', 'educator', 'are', 'served', 'truly', 'funny', 'thoughts', 'body', 'changes', 'puberty', 'fallout', 'dating', 'many', 'simple', 'joys', 'entailed', 'viewing', 'fascinating', 'first-person', 'history', 'lesson', 'absorbing', 'story', 'splendid', 'protagonist', 'Not', 'Art', 'Spiegelman', 'groundbreaking', ""'Maus"", 'have', 'seen', 'similar', 'graphic', 'novel', 'treatment', 'give', 'much', 'wollop', '*', 'Ratatouille', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Animated', 'Film', '2007']",Persepolis

Here is something completely different -- an animated movie produced by humans drawing with pencils on paper in black and white where the emphasis is on the story. We experience the Iranian Islamic Revolution and its brutal aftermath through the eyes of one young Iranian girl and her family.This is recent history that needs to be retold and remembered because Iran looms so large on the world stage today. With its president spewing hatred on Israel and its scientists racing to acquire a nuclear weapon, we should remember how these extremists came to power and what they did to their own people once they had grasped it.The movie is scrupulously fair, depicting the brutality of the Shah followed by the much greater savagery of the Islamic regime which succeeded it. We see women harassed for ""improper"" dress, parties busted, families searched for illegal alcohol. We see the hardship and suffering Iranians had to endure during the 8-year war with Iraq. Most of all, we see the effect of such intolerance and extremism on the delicate psyche of one bright, intelligent woman who wants nothing other than to grow up to be free and to realize her potential.There are many charming and funny incidents in this movie -- it's not a complete downer.

1116996,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B000YAA68W,Andres C. Salama,"[1, 2]","This autobiographical animated feature dealing with the coming of age of a young girl in Iran during the revolutionary period is witty and engaging all way through, as well as technically brilliant, yet its narrow middle class view makes you wince from time to time. Co director Marjanne Satrapi, born in 1969 into a progressive middle class Iranian family, tells how as a young girl she witnessed the fall of the shah, the coming of the Islamic regime, the brutal Iran-Iraq war, how she was sent during the mid 1980s to Austria by her family, where she saw first hand some of the nihilistic life style of European youth, how there she fell into drugs and almost die after a doomed love affair, how she returned to Iran in the early 90s, enrolling in the university and getting into an ill fated marriage before going to exile to France. Made in engaging black and white, 2D animation, and full of faux naif touches, the problem with this movie is Satrapi's inability to see what happened in Iran outside the narrow view of Iran's westernized middle class. In fact, the working class of Iran is virtually absent from the movie. And her personal complaints (about how her right to consume trash culture from the west was infringed) seems petty and trivial (to her credit, she does realize this from time to time, as when she meets an old childhood friend, a crippled veteran from the war). The film ugliest bit is when the girl's mother complains that the new administrator in a hospital in newly revolutionary Iran used to be a window washer.",4,"Fascinating, if not perfect",1211500800,"05 23, 2008",2008,1542,"['autobiographical', 'animated', 'feature', 'dealing', 'coming', 'age', 'young', 'girl', 'Iran', 'revolutionary', 'period', 'witty', 'engaging', 'way', 'as', 'well', 'technically', 'brilliant', 'narrow', 'middle', 'class', 'view', 'wince', 'time', 'time', 'Co', 'director', 'Marjanne', 'Satrapi', 'born', '1969', 'progressive', 'middle', 'class', 'Iranian', 'family', 'how', 'young', 'girl', 'witnessed', 'fall', 'shah', 'coming', 'Islamic', 'regime', 'brutal', 'Iran-Iraq', 'war', 'how', 'was', 'sent', 'mid', '1980s', 'Austria', 'family', 'where', 'saw', 'first', 'hand', 'nihilistic', 'life', 'style', 'European', 'youth', 'how', 'fell', 'drugs', 'almost', 'die', 'doomed', 'love', 'affair', 'how', 'returned', 'Iran', 'early', '90s', 'enrolling', 'university', 'getting', 'ill', 'fated', 'marriage', 'going', 'exile', 'France', 'Made', 'engaging', 'black', 'white', '2D', 'animation', 'full', 'faux', 'naif', 'touches', 'problem', 'movie', 'Satrapi', 'inability', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'Iran', 'narrow', 'view', 'Iran', 'westernized', 'middle', 'class', 'fact', 'working', 'class', 'Iran', 'virtually', 'absent', 'movie', 'personal', 'complaints', 'how', 'right', 'consume', 'trash', 'culture', 'west', 'was', 'infringed', 'petty', 'trivial', 'credit', 'realize', 'time', 'time', 'when', 'old', 'childhood', 'friend', 'crippled', 'veteran', 'war', 'film', 'ugliest', 'bit', 'when', 'girl', 'mother', 'new', 'administrator', 'hospital', 'newly', 'revolutionary', 'Iran', 'used', 'be', 'window', 'washer']",Persepolis

1116998,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000YAA68W,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[0, 0]","Winning the Jury Prize at Cannes in 2007 and even getting a surprising Oscar nod in the Best Animated Feature category, PERSEPOLIS is more of a dramatic biography of one girl's life as she runs away from her country and her Iranian heritage.Most Americans are probably used to animated films being light, funny, or a combination of the two (thinking along the lines of Finding Nemo). But Persepolis isn't even in the same ballpark.The animation is cruder, with thick, black lines indicating the strict black and white laws of Iran during the Islamic Revolution that rocked the nation. No 3-dimensions here either. But the austere coloring and 2-dimensional representations are an integral part of the story.The story follows the real-life history of its creator, Marjane Satrapi, who grew up during Iran's tumult and the battles incurred while trying to find its identity. Marjane, too, tries to find herself, and often latches onto the world around her, until family and friends teach her the horrors of past, present, and probably future.The audience grows up with Marjane, learning the ways of the outside world while watching Iran implode. Alone and lost in a world that doesn't understand her, Marjane must learn to live her life while worrying about what's happening back home (she leaves Iran at the behest of her parents and travels around Europe, going to school and working odd jobs).The gripping story is told all from Marjanes point of view, making the viewer care tremendously about this young girl as she creeps into womanhood. We feel her aches and pains as she tries to understand the world around her but keeps getting stymied by her upbringing and her terrible losses back in Iran.I do have to warn potential viewers, though, that this animation holds back nothing. The language, the wars, sex, drugs, it's all there, and Marjane experiences all of them in their great and terribleness. That being said, this is a breath of fresh air in terms of what most audiences think of as an animated feature. It'll surprise you again and again.",4,A Breath Of Fresh Air For Animated Features...,1229990400,"12 23, 2008",2008,2052,"['Winning', 'Jury', 'Prize', 'Cannes', '2007', 'even', 'getting', 'surprising', 'Oscar', 'nod', 'Best', 'Animated', 'Feature', 'category', 'PERSEPOLIS', 'more', 'dramatic', 'biography', 'one', 'girl', 'life', 'away', 'country', 'Iranian', 'heritage.Most', 'Americans', 'are', 'probably', 'used', 'animated', 'films', 'being', 'light', 'funny', 'combination', 'two', 'thinking', 'lines', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'Persepolis', ""n't"", 'even', 'same', 'ballpark.The', 'animation', 'cruder', 'thick', 'black', 'lines', 'indicating', 'strict', 'black', 'white', 'laws', 'Iran', 'Islamic', 'Revolution', 'rocked', 'nation', '3-dimensions', 'here', 'either', 'austere', 'coloring', '2-dimensional', 'representations', 'are', 'integral', 'part', 'story.The', 'story', 'real-life', 'history', 'creator', 'Marjane', 'Satrapi', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'Iran', 'tumult', 'battles', 'incurred', 'trying', 'find', 'identity', 'Marjane', 'too', 'tries', 'find', 'often', 'world', 'family', 'friends', 'teach', 'horrors', 'past', 'present', 'probably', 'future.The', 'audience', 'up', 'Marjane', 'learning', 'ways', 'outside', 'world', 'watching', 'Iran', 'implode', 'Alone', 'lost', 'world', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Marjane', 'must', 'learn', 'live', 'life', 'worrying', 'what', 'happening', 'back', 'home', 'Iran', 'behest', 'parents', 'travels', 'Europe', 'going', 'school', 'working', 'odd', 'jobs', '.The', 'gripping', 'story', 'told', 'Marjanes', 'point', 'view', 'making', 'viewer', 'care', 'tremendously', 'young', 'girl', 'womanhood', 'feel', 'aches', 'pains', 'understand', 'world', 'getting', 'stymied', 'upbringing', 'terrible', 'losses', 'back', 'Iran.I', 'do', 'have', 'warn', 'potential', 'viewers', 'though', 'animation', 'back', 'nothing', 'language', 'wars', 'sex', 'drugs', 'there', 'Marjane', 'great', 'terribleness', 'being', 'said', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'terms', 'what', 'most', 'audiences', 'think', 'animated', 'feature', ""'ll"", 'surprise', 'again', 'again']",Persepolis
1116999,A1KE3JBO3KQX2O,B000YAA68W,Brian C.,"[2, 2]","This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. This is one of those rare movies which seems to me to reach near perfection and succeeds in every imaginable way. There is simply so much to praise in this little movie I am not sure where to begin. I should offer my SPOILER ALERT at this point as well since I do give away some of what happens in the movie.The story is really a coming of age story set mostly in Iran. The movie provides a very basic history lesson in regard to Iran's recent history which is interesting in its own right. The protagonist of the story, Marjane Satrapi, lives through the overthrow of the Shah, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism, as well as the Iran-Iraq war. As a coming of age story the themes of the movie are universal but it is set against a very unique background and has a political message as well. Marjane's parents send her to school in Vienna and we see her struggling to find her place and her identity as an Iranian. She falls in with a group of dissident, counter-culture types but never really fits in. None of them have backgrounds even remotely resembling her own. She has a failed romance before returning to Iran. Marjane is clearly someone who is, like all of us, struggling to find her place.The movie is apparently based on the autobiographical graphic novel of the same name by Marjane Satrapi. The movie is animated but it is animated in a very unique way. The style of animation seems to have been chosen in order to recreate the feel of a graphic novel or comic book on film. At first I was not sure whether I was going to like the style of animation in this movie, it seemed so different from what I was used to, but it really worked exceptionally well for this film. In a comic book a continuous story is constructed through discontinuous frames. This forces a kind of minimalism on the story. Everything has to be distilled down to its essence. You get maybe six frames a page and a few lines so those lines have to be well chosen. There is no room for extraneous details. Something similar happens in this film. The whole movie is told in this very minimalist way and yet the producers of this movie succeed brilliantly in capturing the essence of everything that happens to Marjane. The story of Marjane's first love, for example, is told in a very compact number of frames and yet this film succeeds in presenting a much fuller and truer picture of first love than any movie I have ever seen and with more insight (the transformation of her first love's image after she discovers him cheating on her for example).Another example is the scene between Marjane and her husband where she is looking for her car keys while he is watching the Terminator. She asks him where the car keys are in an angry way and he turns up the volume on the t.v. and then she finds them in her pocket. All of their marital problems are condensed into that one scene. Somehow in that one scene of Marjane looking for her car keys we get a sense of the entire marriage and its deterioration. A typical hollywood movie would have portrayed the deterioration of the marriage quite differently. First, it probably would turned the husband (or Marjane) into a villain perhaps through infidelity. It then would have brought the deteriorating relationship to a head with a dramatic fight scene. Hollywood trades drama for realism and truth. This movie captures the essence of a deteriorating marriage without turning anyone into a villain and without over-dramatizing.This minimalist style is like having to express everything you have to say in a single sentence. Most movies can ramble on and on and never have anything truly interesting or profound or even true to say. The opposite is the case with this film. This film cuts right to the essential truths of its subject matter without rambling on and on. It is really quite amazing.And the film is entirely devoid of sentimentality or cliche. There is not a false note in this movie. So much on screen emotion feels so utterly false. People are portrayed as they think they are supposed to feel rather than how they actually would feel. This movie is a breath of fresh air. Every emotion in the film is real.Besides being a universal coming of age story the movie also has some interesting and important political themes. It is clear after watching this movie that the values that we tend to think of as Western values, such as individual liberty, freedom of expression, women's rights, democracy, etc. are not, in reality, uniquely Western. Oppression is oppression wherever and whenever it exists and the human spirit rebels against oppression wherever it is found. Marjane Satrapi is more courageous than most in expressing her opposition to oppression but she finds sympathy from nearly everyone around her. The majority of the Iranian people are not happy with their oppressive system (as evidenced by the recent protests there) and this movie documents the Iranian's struggles quite beautifully.The characters are all fully drawn especially Marjane, her parents, and her grandmother with whom Marjane has a special bond. There is a great deal of humor in the movie despite the fact that it is often dealing with heavy themes. This really is a nearly perfect movie. It combines laughter with sadness, comedy with tragedy, personal growth set amidst political turmoil. It deals with its themes (love, coming of age, life in a foreign country, political oppression and resistance to oppression, etc.) in a profound way. The animation is beautiful. The characters are extremely memorable. The movie is extremely unique without being artsy for artsiness sake. And you get a free, short, history lesson on Iran to boot!When I read the description of this movie I was really only mildly interested in watching it. But I was visiting my family and they wanted to watch it so I acquiesced and it turned out to be the best movie I have seen in a long time. If you are at all on the fence about this movie I highly recommend giving it a try. Perhaps you will not like it as much as I did but I think there is a very good chance that you will.",5,Coming of age in Iran...,1325462400,"01 2, 2012",2012,6136,"['one', 'best', 'movies', 'have',

There's good and bad but mostly bad created by those in power be it during the times of the Shah or the mullahs in Iran. The look of the movie is very graphic novel which makes sense because it comes from the same. It does have some genuinely scary, poignant, touching and funny scenes. The filmmaker is a true talented individual.It also helps that she is speaking from the heart as it is her story of her childhood through early 20s trying to figure out her own self but being driven down an almost suicidal hole by the grind that is modern Iran.Some interesting asides: The fact that Iron Maiden may be considered ""punk"" and/or revolutionary let alone the lame sounds of Michael Jackson or ABBA just shows you how freaked out and paranoid the religious leaders are in Iran. Imagine their reaction if they found Iran's youth secretly listening to the Sex Pistols, Clash or any other classic punk.The flip from black-and-white to color when the movie shows scenes in Paris is all that's needed to show how the West, for all its faults, is a place where people can be free from this sort of horrible repression they find in nations like modern Iran.The extras are almost as good as the movie.The Hidden Side is way too long at over 30 minutes.Behind-the-Scenes has Marjane Satrapi (co-director and the person whom is the central character of the movie) and is in English. You get Iggy Pop (voice actor in the English version of the movie) popping up, too!Cannes Press Conference Q&A; has Catherine Denevue whose voice I did not recognize in the movie but she played the grandma.Selected Scene Commentaries are fun but the piece de resistance is the Animated Scene Comparisons.

Just in case anyone's wondering.This film is certainly above average, but I don't think it can touch the two graphic novels.I'm not sure why that is, though.  The same tone and style is used in both, and certainly Marjane Satrapi's creative control infuses both.But the graphic novel was more episodic:  the film bleeds everything together, creating the illusion that it's telling a coherent story.  But the viewer becomes vaguely uncomfortable when he realizes the film isn't telling a coherent story, more of a pastiche.  The graphic novel could get away with this, but the movie can't.Also, the book allowed you to pause, think, and digest.  Movies, by their nature, do not.And the inability to let things sink in before you moved forward definitely blunted the effect of some scenes.There's something I found infuriating, though:That the publishers of this terrific DVD didn't include Farsi subtitles on the disk.  Or any Farsi audio.Oh, it's popular and well-known in Iran.Although the authorities won't let you bring it in to the country, everybody just downloads it illegally.

1117002,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,B000YAA68W,Christopher Culver,"[0, 0]","PERSEPOLIS is an animated adaptation by Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud of Satrapi's critically acclaimed graphic novels which recount her upbringing in revolutionary-era Iran and difficult adaptation to Europe. The film combines both a historical presentation of Iran's tribulations with poignant observations of the immigrant experience.PERSEPOLIS has a few twists and turns like every Bildungsroman, but its course is fairly simple. As the film opens, we see the last days of the Shah's regime and the hope for a new, free country. The release of political prisoners bring Marjane's communist uncle Mantoush home, who tries to instill a desire for justice in his niece. After Khomeini turns the country into a theocratic regime and Iran is mired in a long, pointless war with Iraq, Marjane is sent to a boarding school in Vienna. Here she becomes ashamed of her background, has a constant series of feuds with landlords, and eventually ends up homeless. After she collapses in the cold and is taken to hospital, she decides to return to Iran. But now she finds that instead of the homeland she missed, the country had become even more hardline and corrupt. At the end of the film, Marjane arrives in France, determined to make it in Europe while staying true to herself.Though the tribulations of Satrapi's life were great, PERSEPOLIS is able to depict many things with humour. From Tehran's shady trenchcoat-clad sellers of forbidden music casettes to Marjane's ecstasy in a well-stocked European supermarket, there are a lot of laughs in the film. It sometimes feels a lightweight venture -- the presentation of Iran's history tends toward the didactic, while Marjane's experiences in Austria are never given as much depth as they might have been. Still, it's entertaining and often touching, and I'd recommend it.I saw this film in the original French, so I cannot comment on the voice acting in the English-language version.",4,Remain in Iran with its trials and tribulations or face the challenge of immigration?,1265414400,"02 6, 2010",2010,1937,"['PERSEPOLIS', 'animated', 'adaptation', 'Marjane', 'Satrapi', 'Vincent', 'Paronnaud', 'Satrapi', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'graphic', 'novels', 'recount', 'upbringing', 'revolutionary-era', 'Iran', 'difficult', 'adaptation', 'Europe', 'film', 'combines', 'historical', 'presentation', 'Iran', 'tribulations', 'poignant', 'observations', 'immigrant', 'experience.PERSEPOLIS', 'few', 'twists', 'turns', 'Bildungsroman', 'course', 'fairly', 'simple', 'film', 'see', 'last', 'days', 'Shah', 'regime', 'hope', 'new', 'free', 'country', 'release', 'political', 'prisoners', 'bring', 'Marjane', 'communist', 'uncle', 'Mantoush', 'home', 'who', 'instill', 'desire', 'justice', 'niece', 'Khomeini', 'country', 'theocratic', 'regime', 'Iran', 'mired', 'long', 'pointless', 'war', 'Iraq', 'Marjane', 'sent', 'boarding', 'school', 'Vienna', 'Here', 'ashamed', 'background', 'constant', 'series', 'feuds', 'landlords', 'eventually', 'up', 'homeless', 'cold', 'taken', 'hospital', 'return', 'Iran', 'now', 'instead', 'homeland', 'missed', 'country', 'had', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'hardline', 'corrupt', 'end', 'film', 'Marjane', 'France', 'determined', 'make', 'Europe', 'staying', 'true', 'herself.Though', 'tribulations', 'Satrapi', 'life', 'were', 'great', 'PERSEPOLIS', 'able', 'depict', 'many', 'things', 'humour', 'Tehran', 'shady', 'trenchcoat-clad', 'sellers', 'forbidden', 'music', 'Marjane', 'ecstasy', 'well-stocked', 'European', 'supermarket', 'are', 'lot', 'laughs', 'film', 'sometimes', 'lightweight', 'venture', 'presentation', 'Iran', 'history', 'didactic', 'Marjane', 'experiences', 'Austria', 'are', 'never', 'given', 'much', 'depth', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Still', 'entertaining', 'often', 'touching', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'it.I', 'saw', 'film', 'original', 'French', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'voice', 'acting', 'English-language', 'version']",Persepolis
1117003,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000YAA68W,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 2]","""Persepolis"", based on Marjane Satrapi's graphic novel, is one of those kind of films that acts not only as a well-constructed and thought-provoking film yet at the same time a reminder that animated films are not simply just for kids and parents looking to kill time or adults who are fascinated by robots and bizarre imagery like that from Japan. Its format is rather unique and indeed the method of telling a very adult and politic-centered story using an attractive visual style might seem a bit off-putting but that also makes the story stand out more and it becomes emotional without manipulative and comedic without being untasteful. In essence, it's a story about life...using pencils.Based on novel creator and director Satrapi's life, the film follows Marjane as a young girl living in Iran. Dealing with the oppression and government control of the Shah and hoping for better days. That day comes when the Shah falls and a revolution happens but much to their dismay, the new government is just as worse with fierce laws concerning dress, speaking out about politics, music and social class of women. Marjane is sent away to Vienna but like any traumatic event, moving elsewhere doesn't mean you've entirely escaped your past and the influence of the war is just as powerful as it is anywhere.Awhile ago, I had the pleasure/misfortune of watching another French animated film called ""Renaissance"", another visually-appealing film which wasn't geared towards children. Only problem was the story was incredibly dull and you remember the art style more than you remember the movie. ""Persepolis"" on the other hand not only has a unique style with black-and-white and more exaggerated movements and shots with occasional color sequences but the story is also intriguing. There's not much of a story so to speak and we focus on the progression and maturing of Marjane but the film never feels slow and sluggish and the story helps bring the characters to life, so to speak.But a film concerning a war and revolution doesn't have to be depressing and indeed, there's plenty of humor to be found. Whether it's a pair of eyes poking out of a puff of exhaust Looney Tunes-style or just genuinely funny moments such as a scene concerning flushing alcohol from officers to Marjane herself as a character, the film works on many levels though I doubt kids would be into this. Only thing that didn't sit well with me is that the last 20 minutes or so don't really drag but you can tell the film's starting to slow down a bit, like a runner in a race pushing himself to the end. A weird sequence involving ""Eye of the Tiger"" is strangely funny but in retrospect, it's also a bit too unlike the rest of the film that it sticks out sore thumb-like.I'd recommend watching the French dub with subtitles over the English dub since I don't mind the dub but it's rare for the English track to be better than the original track and I prefer the voices in the French one. We get some looks into the making of the film (but sadly, no feature-length commentary) but I'd recommend watching the film since it's so unlike what I normally watch in animation outside of Japan.",5,Evocative and emotional storytelling,1214438400,"06 26, 2008",2008,3157,"['Persepolis', 'based', 'Marjane', 'Satrapi', 'graphic', 'novel', 'one', 'kind', 'films', 'not', 'only', 'well-constructed', 'thought-provoking', 'film', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'reminder', 'animated', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'simply', 'just', 'kids', 'parents', 'looking', 'kill', 'time', 'adults', 'who', 'are', 'fascinated', 'robots', 'bizarre', 'imagery', 'Japan', 'format', 'rather', 'unique', 'indeed', 'method', 'telling', 'very', 'adult', 'politic-centered', 'story', 'using', 'attractive', 'visual', 'style', 'might', 'seem', 'bit', 'off-putting', 'also', 'story', 'stand', 'out', 'more', 'emotional', 'manipulative', 'comedic', 'being', 'untasteful', 'essence', 'story', 'life', 'using', 'pencils.Based', 'novel', 'creator', 'director', 'Satrapi', 'life', 'film', 'Marjane', 'young', 'girl', 'living', 'Iran', 'Dealing', 'oppression', 'government', 'control', 'Shah', 'hoping', 'better', 'days', 'day', 'when', 'Shah', 'falls', 'revolution', 'much', 'dismay', 'new', 'government', 'just', 'worse', 'fierce', 'laws', 'concerning', 'dress', 'speaking', 'out', 'politics', 'music', 'social', 'class', 'women', 'Marjane', 'sent', 'away', 'Vienna', 'traumatic', 'event', 'moving', 'elsewhere', ""n't"", 'mean', ""'ve"", 'entirely', 'escaped', 'past', 'influence', 'war', 'just', 'as', 'powerful', 'anywhere.Awhile', 'ago', 'had', 'pleasure/misfortune', 'watching', 'French', 'animated', 'film', 'called', 'Renaissance', 'visually-appealing', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'geared', 'towards', 'children', 'Only', 'problem', 'was', 'story', 'was', 'incredibly', 'dull', 'remember', 'art', 'style', 'more', 'remember', 'movie', 'Persepolis', 'other', 'hand', 'not', 'only', 'unique', 'style', 'black-and-white', 'more', 'exaggerated', 'movements', 'shots', 'occasional', 'color', 'sequences', 'story', 'also', 'intriguing', 'not', 'much', 'story', 'so', 'speak', 'focus', 'progression', 'maturing', 'Marjane', 'film', 'never', 'slow', 'sluggish', 'story', 'bring', 'characters', 'life', 'so', 'speak.But', 'film', 'concerning', 'war', 'revolution', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'depressing', 'indeed', 'plenty', 'humor', 'be', 'found', 'pair', 'eyes', 'poking', 'puff', 'exhaust', 'Looney', 'Tunes-style', 'just', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'moments', 'such', 'scene', 'concerning', 'flushing', 'alcohol', 'officers', 'Marjane', 'character', 'film', 'many', 'levels', 'doubt', 'kids', 'would', 'be', 'Only', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'drag', 'can', 'tell', 'film', 'starting', 'slow', 'down', 'bit', 'runner', 'race', 'pushing', 'end', 'weird', 'sequence', 'involving', 'Eye', 'Tiger', 'strangely', 'funny', 'retrospect', 'also', 'bit', 'too', 'rest', 'film', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb-like.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'watching', 'French', 'dub', 'subtitles', 'English', 'dub', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'dub', 'rare', 'English', 'track', 'be', 'better', 'original', 'track', 'prefer', 'voices', 'French', 'one', 'get', 'looks', 'making', 'film', 'sadly', 'feature-length', 'commentary', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'watching', 'film', 'so', 'what', 'normally', 'watch', 'animation', 'Japan']",Persepolis

It won the Jury Prize at that year's Cannes Film Festival and was also nominated at the Oscars for Best Animated Feature. It's based on Marjane Satrapi's graphic novel, and tells the story of Satrapi's own life.""Persepolis"" opens at Orly, one of the main Paris airports, with Marji preparing for her return to Tehran. The prospect of returning is weighing heavily on her and, as she tries to gather herself, she thinks back to her childhood - in the days leading up to the Iranian Revolution.Marji was just an ordinary 10-year old in 1979. She loved eating French Fries with red sauce, idolized Bruce Lee and had only two dreams : to, one day, shave her legs and to be the last prophet. Naturally, she understood little of the ""adult world"" - Marji liked the Shah, and believed her teachers when they said he'd been appointed by God. Her parents soon put her straight : they, with good reason, detested the Shah. The current Shah inherited his position from his father - who, in turn, had been appointed by the British, rather than God. Furthermore, her Grandfather (a prince, no less) and her Uncle Anoosh had been imprisoned by one Shah or another and both had been devoted Communists - viewed by both Shahs as something evil. Wide-eyed and deeply impressed, Marji immediately switches sides and becomes a devout revolutionary...well, she adopts Che Guevara as a role model and chants anti-Shah slogans in the living -room. Her parents are careful to confine her when the uprising finally comes - something they're involved in themselves. With the fall of the Shah, life is - for a short spell - like a dream. Old family friends - like Siamak, who had been routinely tortured - and Marji's Uncle Anoosh are released from prison. Like Marji's parents, both are hopeful of a better society. Marji had known nothing of her Uncle before his release from prison but, before long, the pair are devoted to each other. Unfortunately, their hopes prove unfounded. Islamic Fundamentalists win the following elections, and society becomes even more oppressive. Many of the Shah's former enemies - including Anoosh - are hunted down and returned to prison; others, like Siamak, flee. However, Marji and her family stay put...with our young heroine becoming more and more disillusioned. In time, she turns her back on her dreams of being a prophet - instead, she starts listening to Iron Maiden, adds a denim jacket and trainers to her hijab and argues with her teacher when she lies about their wonderful new government. Naturally, her parents are a little concerned that she's speaking up like this...and feel they have to do something to protect her. The path they set her on eventually leads to the confused young woman sitting in Orly Airport.An absolutely brilliant movie, one that is much more than ""just a cartoon"". The film was initially released in France, with Chiara Mastroianni (as Marjane) and Catherine Deneuve (as her mother) amongst the voice actors.

If it had had a better ending, or even a more definite ending, it'd be five-stars all the way. I have seen Persepolis several times since buying it last month and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes an imaginative story or who wants to learn more about the Iranian Revolution, the Iran-Iraq War, or the struggle for the stifled soul to breathe free inside a fundamentalist Islamic Republic. Persepolis does a grand job of putting faces onto Iranians of the extraordinary and mundane stripe, from a charming old grandmother, to a kindly uncle tragically murdered by revolutionaries, to everyday kids lethally persecuted for trying to have party. Above all Persepolis cracks many stereotypes and shows the uniqueness and goodness in everyone, even as it stares down those who would seek to crush the human spirit in the name of their God. It also irrefutably condemns the evils of Islamism, which is merely another guise for totalitarian of an all-too familiar order.

The movement is towards ever more realistic and textured canvases that paint an exquisitely detailed world in glowing shades of pure, pixellated magic. Persepolis, however, is an exception to the rule, a throwback every bit as successful as Aardman's work with clay. This largely black-and-white, defiantly undetailed and sometimes stylised film could have been made at any point since the dawn of cinema, and yet it's a thoroughly modern affair.An autobiographical tale that was written as a graphic novel, adapted for the screen and then co-directed by its chief character, Marjane Satrapi, this is a highly personal look at a situation of real complexity. Satrapi was six, born into a prosperous Tehran home, when the Iranian Revolution swept away the Shah Of Iran and the country's autocracy was replaced with extremist rule. The war with Iraq that raged for seven years then destroyed much of Iran's wealth, and the subsequent religious crackdowns killed any hope Satrapi and her family had of democratic freedom as well.The film is at its strongest when examining the turbulent history of Iran through Marjane's eyes. Marjane-as-a-child is one of the most appealing characters in years, happy to embrace new ideas like the latest Igglepiggle and believing herself, briefly, to be a prophet appointed by God. That's not to say that she isn't spoiled, wilful and occasionally cruel - witness Marjane and friends deciding to arm themselves with nails and torture a classmate whose father worked for the secret police. But there's an innocence and exuberance to her schemes that is endlessly charming, and having a child as our guide perfectly pitches the history for those of us who know little about Iran's murky politics. In a sense, the film is the antithesis of most modern animation: where they tell a relatively simple story using complex instruments, this uses very basic tools to tell a story about a very complex time.The film's second act, wherein Marjane grows up alone in Austria and loses her way, is less winning but still involving, a sometimes bleak counterpoint to her earlier optimism. But if that middle section introduces something of a minor note, the tempo picks up again with her return to a transformed, more hardline Iran. Still bolshy, Marjane doesn't fit into that strictly monitored society, but it's in that defiance that she rediscovers her zest for life.That second half provides a powerful argument that our origins shape who we become - no matter how far we travel. Marjane can't be content in Europe after being sent into exile from her home, but equally can't stomach the restrictions of an Islamic state after being raised in a free Iran and then in Europe. The film is ultimately the story of her quest to find a balance between homeland and freedom, when her nation has failed to do the same. Satrapi's willingness to acknowledge, and make fun of, her own faults makes this a story with real depth, and in these hysterical times, the sight of a young girl standing up to fundamentalist bullies is a vital counterpoint to the West's tendency to tar all Middle Easterns with the same terrorist brush.",5,Artistic Accomplishment,1211241600,"05 20, 2008",2008,3227,"['Pixar', 'down', 'general', 'trend', 'animation', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'been', 'clear', 'movement', 'towards', 'ever', 'more', 'realistic', 'textured', 'canvases', 'paint', 'exquisitely', 'detailed', 'world', 'glowing', 'shades', 'pure', 'pixellated', 'magic', 'Persepolis', 'however', 'exception', 'rule', 'throwback', 'bit', 'as', 'successful', 'Aardman', 'work', 'clay', 'largely', 'black-and-white', 'defiantly', 'undetailed', 'sometimes', 'stylised', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'point', 'dawn', 'cinema', 'yet', 'thoroughly', 'modern', 'affair.An', 'autobiographical', 'tale', 'was', 'written', 'graphic', 'novel', 'adapted', 'screen', 'then', 'co-directed', 'chief', 'character', 'Marjane', 'Satrapi', 'highly', 'personal', 'look', 'situation', 'real', 'complexity', 'Satrapi', 'was', 'six', 'born', 'prosperous', 'Tehran', 'home', 'when', 'Iranian', 'Revolution', 'swept', 'away', 'Shah', 'Iran', 'country', 'autocracy', 'was', 'replaced', 'extremist', 'rule', 'war', 'Iraq', 'raged', 'seven', 'years', 'then', 'destroyed', 'much', 'Iran', 'wealth', 'subsequent', 'religious', 'crackdowns', 'killed', 'hope', 'Satrapi', 'family', 'had', 'democratic', 'freedom', 'well.The', 'film', 'strongest', 'when', 'examining', 'turbulent', 'history', 'Iran', 'Marjane', 'eyes', 'Marjane-as-a-child', 'one', 'most', 'appealing', 'characters', 'years', 'happy', 'embrace', 'new', 'ideas', 'latest', 'Igglepiggle', 'believing', 'briefly', 'be', 'prophet', 'appointed', 'God', 'not', 'say', ""n't"", 'spoiled', 'wilful', 'occasionally', 'cruel', 'witness', 'Marjane', 'friends', 'deciding', 'arm', 'nails', 'torture', 'classmate', 'father', 'worked', 'secret', 'police', 'innocence', 'exuberance', 'schemes', 'endlessly', 'charming', 'having', 'child', 'guide', 'perfectly', 'history', 'who', 'know', 'little', 'Iran', 'murky', 'politics', 'sense', 'film', 'antithesis', 'most', 'modern', 'animation', 'where', 'tell', 'relatively', 'simple', 'story', 'using', 'complex', 'instruments', 'very', 'basic', 'tools', 'tell', 'story', 'very', 'complex', 'time.The', 'film', 'second', 'act', 'wherein', 'Marjane', 'up', 'alone', 'Austria', 'way', 'less', 'winning', 'still', 'involving', 'sometimes', 'bleak', 'counterpoint', 'earlier', 'optimism', 'middle', 'section', 'introduces', 'something', 'minor', 'note', 'tempo', 'up', 'again', 'return', 'transformed', 'more', 'hardline', 'Iran', 'Still', 'bolshy', 'Marjane', ""n't"", 'fit', 'strictly', 'monitored', 'society', 'defiance', 'zest', 'life.That', 'second', 'half', 'powerful', 'argument', 'origins', 'shape', 'who', 'become', 'matter', 'how', 'far', 'travel', 'Marjane', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'content', 'Europe', 'being', 'sent', 'exile', 'home', 'equally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stomach', 'restrictions', 'Islamic', 'state', 'being', 'raised', 'free', 'Iran', 'then', 'Europe', 'film', 'ultimately', 'story', 'quest', 'find', 'balance', 'homeland', 'freedom', 'when', 'nation', 'failed', 'do', 'same', 'Satrapi', 'willingness', 'acknowledge', 'make', 'fun', 'own', 'faults', 'story', 'real', 'depth', 'hysterical', 'times', 'sight', 'young', 'girl', 'standing', 'up', 'fundamentalist', 'bullies', 'vital', 'counterpoint', 'West', 'tendency', 'tar', 'Middle', 'Easterns', 'same', 'terrorist', 'brush']",Persepolis

1117011,A2IHIKHWCDB0FG,B000YAA68W,Dexter Manning,"[0, 0]","THE FILMThis is not to disparage animated films made by studios in the United States, of which there are numerous excellent examples (""WALL-E,"" ""The Incredibles,"" ""Aladdin,"" ""Iron Giant,"" and ""An American Tail"" are but a handful of relatively recent titles and, of course, one cannot forget the classic animations from Walt Disney--""101 Dalmations,"" ""Fantasia,"" ""Bambi,"" ""Pinocchio,"" ""Cinderella."")But it seems to this reviewer that, at least over the past couple decades, the animated work from the film industries in other countries--Japan, the UK, France, even Canada--are not only more diverse stylistically than their American brethren but better demonstrate the extensive range of stories to which this technique can be successfully applied. Too often, especially in the modern age, US animated films are limited to visually slick confections with a play-it-safe, family-friendly vibe. It appears that a body of unwritten rules apply to each animated film, none of which would be imposed as strictly on live-action movies. First and foremost, the basic story of each must be based in fantasy and be enjoyable by children--though it's a plus if a few adults at least don't find it boring. Stories that may disturb children or otherwise contain more mature themes are off-limits. Its characters and other contents should be rendered so as to fit a prescribed idea of attractiveness. Its general visual aesthetic, character action, and other movement should be delineated by a smooth gloss and even be somewhat ""realistic,"" (no bold abstractions in style)--if that's ever truly possible in animation; it's less possible than one may think even in live-action. (Computer-rendered graphics, it turns out, can serve this need fairly well.) And, if nothing else, it absolutely, positively may not overtly refer to anything political or religious.It's not that animated movies born of this philosophy are not realized by other nations; they can be. It's simply that animated films that, in at least a few topics, run contrary to this way of thinking are also produced there, and are often well-received by their public. This is obvious in ""Fantastic Planet,"" a seventies-era French classic, but also in more recent films like the United Kingdom's ""Chicken Run"" and ""Wallace & Grommit""; ""The Triplets of Belleville"" from Canada; ""Metropolis,"" ""Paprika,"" the movies of Hayao Miyazaki, and any number of other Japanese anime. Continuing the tradition of imaginative creativity in foreign-language animation, while telling a poignant story infused by the politics of its setting, is ""Persepolis,"" a French film from 2007 written and directed by Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud and based on a pair of Satrapi's graphic novels.The film, like their books of reference, is Satrapi's autobiographical story, beginning as a young girl (voiced by Gabrielle Lopes) growing up in Iran as part of a decidedly liberal and political family at the start of that nation's revolution in 1978. Idealistic as children often are, she marches around her apartment, proclaiming her support of a new government--""Down with the Shah! Down with the Shah!...""--until her parents tell her to go to bed. At nights in her bedroom she often speaks to a god who has long appeared in the clouds of her imagination, seeking his advice and reassurance.Upon learning the news from her father that the old, despised Iranian leadership has been overthrown--a dream held by Satrapi's parents and extended family for many years--this small girl, in some ways, is the most vocal and elated member of that family (although her views at that age are colored by those closest to her). In fact, they, at times, tell her to tone it down. Though it lasts for only a few seconds, the simple sight of Mr Satrapi spinning the little girl around in the air is one of the most memorable in the film. The hopes of a child, her family, and her nation are elevated skyward.Unfortunately, those hopes are soon quashed as the new regime proves itself to be at least as oppressive as its predecessor. A religious-based fundamentalism, tyranical in its application, unforgiving toward those who openly object to it, quickly grips the nation like a vise. School curricula are modified to those which instill the respect and fear of the state and its leaders into young, impressionable minds. Women and girls are instructed to wear veils. Western culture is condemned. Liberal views--and anyone harboring them--are to be dealt with mercilessly. The Satrapi family is itself touched by the rulers' growing intolerance when young Marji's uncle, too outspoken in this era of oppression, is imprisoned.But, rather than fear, Marji, as she grows into a rebellious teen (Chiara Mastroianni, who also gives voice to the adult Marjane), cultivates her own particular brand of defiance, not only prefering to shirk the veil, and rejecting the code of conduct imposed on her country by the Shah, but rocking to the sounds of punk and Michael Jackson and Abba. Her experiences finding such music is a commentary that is both humorous and sad.Her parents, fearing that the situation in Iran has grown too dangerous, especially for their increasingly outspoken daughter, send her to live in Vienna, Austria, if only for her safety. One would expect Satrapi to be more comfortable in the more liberal European society, and in some ways she is, but she also remains largely an outsider to those around her, this time not for her political views, but for the fact that she is Iranian and the two cultures are as different as they are from each other. She becomes friends with a group of free-spirited college students and experiments with the usual substances and lifestyles kids often experiment with. Her older friends think themselves knowlegeable and open-minded, but it's a case where the youth has a more substantial life experience than her elders. She then finds a hopeless infatuation for her blond, wavy-haired Austrian boyfriend--then, she finds a hatred for him that is more hopeless. Other events conspire to unravel her life as she fully comes of age, though considerably earlier than most do. The film never veers from Satrapi's perspective, either as a precocious little girl or as the young woman later in the story, which lends a certain simplicity and focus to the entire story.The most striking aspect of the picture, of course, is the its notable visual aesthetic. Inspired by its source books, Persepolis and Persepolis 2, the animated images, supervised by Christian Desmares, are rendered almost entirely in bold black and white, with some shades of gray mixed in. Other colors, in the few scenes in which they are used, tend to be somewhat subdued so the general feeling of the film is not disrupted. The color scenes are set during different times in the story and coincide with our protagonist's increasing maturity. The pictures, as they are drawn, are a bit smoother than the graphics in the original novels, though by no means do they look anything like the typical Hollywood animated film of the 2000s. Although some digital work was used to create the animated effects and compositions, computerization does not take center stage. The characters and settings exude a much more hand-drawn feel. Three-dimensional rendering is not attempted here. Instead, distances in these deliberately flat visual concoctions (that is not a criticism) are implied chiefly by the proportions and shapes of objects as they relate to one another. This infuses much of the experience with a certain kind of innocent enchantment, particularly the sections focused on Marji as a young girl.Just as significant as the visuals, of course, are the people who inhabit that world: Marji's left-leaning and hopeful mother (Catherine Deneuve) and father (Simon Abkarian); her remarkably progressive grandmother (a wonderful Danielle Darrieux) with, for instance, a laissez-faire approach to marriage--old-fashioned she is not; and Marjane's activist Uncle Anoush (Franois Jerosme). But, at the center of this tumultuous, unforgettable world, is Marjane herself, growing up, growing rebellious, and growing wiser, all in her own distinct way.The film was easily nominated in its year for the best animated feature Academy Award. It didn't actually win over the typical Hollywood animated movie that took the statue, but, in the eyes of this critic, it most certainly deserved to. A similar situation has happened with other animated films of late. Big money-makers tend to win over smaller, stylistically avant-garde features. Besides the money issue, however, I think Hollywood simply isn't ready to give their most coveted award to a film that is as stylistically alien and thematically mature and candid as ""Persepolis,"" and it certainly isn't ready to actually produce them. It may not be for a long while, and that's too bad. I like to imagine that, in the not-too-distant future, the situation may change, that we could eventually see the birth of an animation revolution in the States. Until then, however, I'll have to look to our animated &eacute;migr&eacute;s.ON THE DISCThis review refers to the Blu-ray disc edition. The features of other available editions may differ.High-definition 1080p transfers are a particular benefit to movies that use graphic elements extensively, such as this. The drawn lines and textures are sharp and clear, even moreso than they were in theaters. The tones of color and gray are rich and subtle differences can be detected. The sound is as good as can be by today's standards with Dolby TrueHD 5.1 for both the French and English soundtracks. My only complaint about the visuals is that the white subtitles are sometimes a bit difficult to decipher, despite the black outlines. A light shadow effect behind the letters would probably have resolved this.There are indeed two soundtracks available on the disc. In addition to the original French, the English soundtrack is available. Users can toggle between the two via the menus. The English-language track includes the voices of Mastroianni and Deneuve, reprising the same roles as in the French. Other performers featured in English include Sean Penn, Gena Rowlands, and Iggy Pop. The English version is well-done, though this reviewer tends to prefer the original language version.""The Hidden Side of Persepolis"" is a half-hour documentary that details the making of the film, from how the two co-directors met and work together, to the philosophy of telling the story using animation as opposed to live-action, to the process of developing the animation. ""Behind the Scenes of Persepolis,"" an eight-minute featurette and something of a promotional piece, provides further details about the making of the film. They essentially touch on the basics of the technical aspects of the film. One wishes that the making-of documentary were longer and more detailed, especially considering the lack of a feature-length audio commentary.The film won the grand jury prize at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival and included on the disc is a Q&A-style; press conference held at that festival. It seems somewhat unusual for a nearly-half-hour-long recording of such a conference to be included as a special feature on a disc, but the simple and, albeit, rather dry, session turns out to be rather informative on how the film came to be realized. Included on the panel are the two directors, Satrapi and Paronnaud; the actors Deneuve, Abkarian, and Mastroianni; executive producer Kathleeen Kennedy; and others.Shedding a little more light on how the visual concepts of the film were created and morphed through their various stages, the animated scene comparisons, which feature commentary by Satrapi, compare the initial storyboard and other drawings to the completed scenes, many of which never made the final cut of the movie. Also included is an animation test, a sliver of a segment that shows a bit of how the filmmakers experimented and refined the animation style. The segment is a fascinating record of the development process.The disc features audio commentary by directors Satrapi and Paronnaud and actress Mastroanni, though only on three scenes, spanning about six minutes. The comments provide much insight into the filmmakers intentions, enough so that one truly wishes the disc came with the full, feature-length commentary the movie clearly deserves.Although there are trailers for a number of other films, there is none for ""Persepolis"" itself. The trailer as it appeared in theaters, which was influential in convincing audiences to see the film in the first place, would have been a welcome addition to this disc. For some reason, studios leave off the theatrical trailers of recent theatrical releases about as often as they include them. Such omissions are puzzling because seeing how this most-central piece of a film's marketing is handled makes for among the most intriguing of special features, often meriting its own review. Furthermore, given that such trailers usually already exist at the time discs are created, they are easily among the easiest special features to include.Navigation of the disc is reasonably straightforward, with a good number of chapters, an easy bookmarking system, a timeline-style graphic that pinponts the exact time location of of live viewing and chapters, and an attractive, user-friendly interface, all these features being the norm for Blu-ray discs from Sony. A minor issue is the fact that the top-level menu titles shift their locations when they are selected (the one chosen moves horizontally across the bottom of the screen to left-most position), which is somewhat disconcerting and time-consuming. A larger issue (one that is a less appealing norm of Sony Blu-ray discs) is the fact that the chapters are not given names, which would go a long way toward helping viewers find scenes faster.",4,Persepolis: A Review.,1234742400,"02 16, 2009",2009,13866,"['FILMThis', 'not', 'disparage', 'animated', 'films', 'made', 'studios', 'United', 'States', 'are', 'numerous', 'excellent',

1117013,ADKHI1TUGAX4,B000YAA68W,E. Anderson,"[6, 7]","This weekend I went to see the Oscar nominated film Persepolis. The film is based on the graphic novel of the same name by Iranian author Marjane Satrapi. Marjane also writes the screenplay as well as directs the animated film with the help of Vincent Paronnaud. The film/graphic novel is autobiographical on Marjane's life during and after the reign of the Shah. Legendary Gallic actress Catherine Deneuve and her daughter Chiara Mastroianni ironically assumes the mother and daughter roles in the film. For people who don't like subtitles, this film isn't for you. The entire film is in French with English subtitles.I was pleasantly surprised to find myself engrossed by the story of Marjane Satrapi than by the animation. Her life in and outside of Iran was anything but boring. The film is particularly spot on when it came to describing life in Iran during the early '80s when the Shah was in power. Life in Iran became even more unbearable when the overzealous religious whackjobs got into power after the fall of the Shah. I believe it was Marjane who mentions that the only reason the religious fundamentalists got into power was because most of the country was illiterate and uneducated, and nationalism and religion was the only things that everyone knew. Voting for religious fundamentalists proved to be the country's own undoing.The film isn't all that dark depressing. There are plenty of laugh out loud moments through out the film where Marjane could laugh at herself like her love life. Another hilarious moment is after Marjane goes through a bought of depression after returning to Iran, she decides to pick herself up and go back to school, singing to the tune of ""Eye of the Tiger"" by Survivor. Let me just say that Chiara  Mastroianni can't sing a single note to save her life but her lack of singing ability makes that particular moment in the film all the more earnest and endearing to me as well as hilarious. The music in the film is fantastic. It is a mix of French pop/techno and Middle Eastern music.There were many times during the film when I was so engrossed with the story that I forgot that the film was animated. Persepolis felt more like a biopic than an animated film. It is rare to find an animated film where the story sucks the viewer in until the the ending credits begins to roll. This film is definitely worth viewing for anyone who has the opportunity to do so.",5,A fabulous animated film,1203292800,"02 18, 2008",2008,2406,"['weekend', 'went', 'see', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'film', 'Persepolis', 'film', 'based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Iranian', 'author', 'Marjane', 'Satrapi', 'Marjane', 'also', 'screenplay', 'as', 'well', 'directs', 'animated', 'film', 'help', 'Vincent', 'Paronnaud', 'film/graphic', 'novel', 'autobiographical', 'Marjane', 'life', 'reign', 'Shah', 'Legendary', 'Gallic', 'actress', 'Catherine', 'Deneuve', 'daughter', 'Chiara', 'Mastroianni', 'ironically', 'mother', 'daughter', 'roles', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'subtitles', 'film', ""n't"", 'entire', 'film', 'French', 'English', 'subtitles.I', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'engrossed', 'story', 'Marjane', 'Satrapi', 'animation', 'life', 'Iran', 'was', 'anything', 'boring', 'film', 'particularly', 'spot', 'when', 'came', 'describing', 'life', 'Iran', 'early', ""'80s"", 'when', 'Shah', 'was', 'power', 'Life', 'Iran', 'became', 'even', 'more', 'unbearable', 'when', 'overzealous', 'religious', 'whackjobs', 'got', 'power', 'fall', 'Shah', 'believe', 'was', 'Marjane', 'who', 'only', 'reason', 'religious', 'fundamentalists', 'got', 'power', 'was', 'most', 'country', 'was', 'illiterate', 'uneducated', 'nationalism', 'religion', 'was', 'only', 'things', 'everyone', 'knew', 'Voting', 'religious', 'fundamentalists', 'proved', 'be', 'country', 'own', 'undoing.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'dark', 'depressing', 'are', 'plenty', 'laugh', 'loud', 'moments', 'film', 'where', 'Marjane', 'could', 'laugh', 'love', 'life', 'hilarious', 'moment', 'Marjane', 'bought', 'depression', 'returning', 'Iran', 'pick', 'up', 'go', 'back', 'school', 'singing', 'tune', 'Eye', 'Tiger', 'Survivor', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'Chiara', 'Mastroianni', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'single', 'note', 'save', 'life', 'lack', 'singing', 'ability', 'particular', 'moment', 'film', 'more', 'earnest', 'endearing', 'as', 'well', 'hilarious', 'music', 'film', 'fantastic', 'mix', 'French', 'pop/techno', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'were', 'many', 'times', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'so', 'engrossed', 'story', 'forgot', 'film', 'was', 'animated', 'Persepolis', 'felt', 'more', 'biopic', 'animated', 'film', 'rare', 'find', 'animated', 'film', 'where', 'story', 'viewer', 'ending', 'credits', 'roll', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'viewing', 'anyone', 'who', 'opportunity', 'do', 'so']",Persepolis
1117014,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000YAA68W,Ed Uyeshima,"[7, 7]","Hand-drawn animation, especially simple black-and-white drawings, is so rare to see on the big screen that one has to appreciate the emotional nakedness that Marjane Satrapi and her fellow cartoonist Vincent Paronnaud bring to this 2007 fictionalized memoir of Satrapi's formative years as the free-spirited daughter in a liberal Iranian family. The 95-minute film follows the same abstract style found in her best-sellingautobiographical graphic novel, adding color for the present-day scenes and using a shadow theater approach to the historical sequences. The cumulative effect works well within the context of the story's volatile emotional changes as it alternates in quicksilver fashion between poignant, funny and harrowing. The film reminds me a bit of Mark Forster's adaptation of Khaled Hosseini'sThe Kite Runner, which also has a protagonist forced to live in exile due to the advent of war and tyranny. The difference is that Satrapi's family stayed in Tehran throughout the turmoil brought on by the Shah's overthrow, the oppressive fundamentalist regime that followed, and the Iran-Iraq war. Some of this comes across as a bit muddled, but the propulsive narrative drive and empathetic voice characterizations compensate greatly.The plot flashes back to Marjane's childhood in Iran during the 1970's as she gradually begins to understand how her family has been mistreated and imprisoned due to their Communist leanings under the Shah. Once the Islamic Revolution deposes of the Shah in 1979, the family faces even more persecution by the new government. Forced to wear a burqa, Marjane has an escalating desire to express her individuality through listening to heavy rock music and questioning authority at every turn. During the 1980's, Marjane's parents decide to send their daughter to Austria to continue her education since Iran was becoming a political hotbed with the oncoming Iran-Iraq war promising even greater horrors. In he meantime, Marjane never fits into Viennese student life, and her situation worsens with a series of bad romantic relationships. She ends up on the streets, and her desperation becomes such that she returns home to Iran. Falling into a crevasse between Western and Eastern cultures, Marjane falls into a depression until she faces up to her true fate. What Satrapi and Paronnaud do especially well is make the animated Marjane's journey a universal one that gives personalized insights into the current challenges facing the Middle East.The 2008 DVD offers both the original French and English-dubbed versions of the feature. The filmmakers recruited quite a cast of voices to inhabit the characters, including Chiara Mastroianni as Marjane, her mother Catherine Deneuve as Marjane's mother, and another legend, Danielle Darrieux as Marjane's feisty grandmother. Deneuve and Darrieux played mother-and-daughter in Jacques Demy's candy-coated musical,The Young Girls of Rochefortover four decades earlier. On the English version, Mastroianni and Deneuve repeat their roles, but Gena Rowlands takes over for Darrieux. There are several other extras on the DVD, the chief one being a half-hour documentary in French, ""The Hidden Side of Persepolis"", which gives a highly detailed look at the production process. Satrapi and Paronnaud are interviewed extensively, as are several crew members and both the 91-year-old Darrieux and Mastroianni (a dead ringer for her father Marcello). There are two other pieces - a brief short, ""Behind-the-Scenes of Persepolis"", which focuses primarily on the English dubbing process with Rowlands and Iggy Pop, and a half-hour press conference held at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival with Satrapi, Paronnaud, the film's producers, as well as Mastroianni and Deneuve. There is no full-length directors' commentary track, but three scenes have individual subtitled commentary - Satrapi on the opening scene in color, Mastroianni on the amusing ""Eye of the Tiger"" scene, and Paronnaud on the establishing shots of Vienna.

The book's stark black and white images perfectly suited the horror of life under the Shah and the Ayatollahs. Could a movie adaptation ever do justice to the Satrapi's harrowing account? Thankfully, it pretty much did.The movie more or less follows the narrative of Satrapi's work, following her from an idealistic (and a bit sadistic!) young girl through her struggles with the repressive forces of the revolution, to her wastrel exile in Vienna, and to her return to her home country. The character list from the book is a drastically simplified, focusing mostly on Satrapi's beloved grandmother, an adored uncle who dies in prison and her protective and secularized parents. Satrapi's artistic style, one of the neat things about the book, was retained, but expanded enough to allow the film to breathe. This is a true adaptation -- not a slavish repetition of the book's style and themes. I only wish that it could have been be longer.

1117022,A3FOVF353HED72,B000YAA68W,Kaman,"[10, 31]","This movie is bad. If you're informed enough about Iran, this can be a refreshing look at things but if not, you got to read a bit more before seeing this movie.The first 20 minutes of the film is to bash the former Shah of Iran and his late father Reza Shah the great as most ex-Communists and leftists do these days and mislead the viewers to believe that Reza Shah the great was a product of British control over Iran at the time which is an utter nonsense and it just goes to repeat the same old cliche of conspiracy theorists in the Iranian society. Yes, the vast majority of Iranians still believe that British had something to do with installing Reza Shah to power and they're unable to see the facts of the past and accept that Reza Shah was not installed by the Brits, yet he disliked the colonial powers and was an extreme nationalist who cared for nothing but his own shattered country. The other shortcoming of this animated film was to repeat the same terrible anti-Shah nonsense that you can hear in most Marxist-Islamist circles today. The first 20-30 minutes were badly wasted to tell the clueless western viewer that the Shah was wrong to prosecute the Stalin supported Azeri separatists of Iran in 1946-47 who had orders from Kremlin to disintegrate Iran from within. Yes, according to Ms. Satrapi's accounts, it was okay for a Stalinist group to seize parts of Iran but it was wrong for the government to stop them. One has to remember that Ms. Satrapi basically comes from a Communist family where his uncles and father are/were proudly anti-Shah Marxist activists.What disturbed me most through out the entire movie was the fact that author really failed to mention the source of oppression in post-revolution Iran which is/was Islamofascism and the mullahs who enforce that ideology. No mention of Khomeini in the movie is a mystery to me. Ms. Satrapi portrayed the late Shah as a commie-hating brutal dictator, yet she definitely failed to show who the real evil was represented by in post-revolution Iran. Yeah, I saw the moral police behavior towards western clothing or late night parties but who enforced that? Satrapi failed to tell the viewer. If I wasn't from that country or didn't know much, I'd not be able to guess who enforced a ban on alcohol or western music.The graphic novels which this animated movie is based on are truly reflective of the lives of many Iranians who like Ms. Satrapi suffered a a lot but again one has to remember that the story told by the author represents a tiny minority of the Iranian people. And the novels are the memoirs of one specific person and don't really tell us the whole story and I, for one, didn't expect her to talk about my story or stories of others. Persepolis is the story of Marjane Satrapi and for that, it is nothing special. She got to go to Europe because her family could afford it while me and tons of people like me had to suffer under the war of the cities and put up with the Islamic regime oppressive system. She got to leave Iran in mid 1990s again when she got depressed after a short time living under the mullah's rule but millions and millions of us had no choice but to stay there and soldier on. Persepolis animated movie is just about Ms. Satrapi's complicated life and has nothing to do with the vast majority of the people held hostage by the Islamic regime of Iran. Kudos to her for making money by selling her story but it really doesn't change much for those who still live inside of the country and have to suffer a great deal due to the mistakes Ms. Satrapi's communist father and uncles made in pre-revolution eras.

As The Who sang, ""Meet the new boss/Same as the old boss.""

I feel very strongly about this probably because I have gone through many similar experiences (with different background) so when I was watching the movie , the truth in it almost made me cry.We are used an Iran depicted by CNN and George Bush Administration but this is a very narrow and politicized view of Iran - Persia as a country has an enormous cultural roots and strong social fabric which the islamic rulers cannot destroy so easily and we also forget to realize that Islam (speacially the persian version) was not aggressive or brutal  infact they gave us Rumi. Thye movie shows an amazing transformation of Iran through the last century - this transformation has never been produced so lucidly anywhere. It also shows that the subcultural of this liberal front in Iran has not died (not yet) and it still can germinate back again. The protagonist see the revolution (where Shah is removed), the war with Iraq - see gets support from her liberal grandma who represents the subculture of liberalism which never died. This movie probably shows the biggest difference between Iran and Arab nations (like Saudi) - most of the time we lump Iran in the same category with Arab nations but Persia was completely a different world.Then when the protagonist moves to Europe for her studies - she faces the challenges of cultural differences and her inner battle of identity crisis - this depiction is poetic it is almost like somebody is reading from Albert Camus - sometimes the inner demons wins but finally she overcomes the hurdles and moves forward - the movie ends with an ray of hope - it shows that Iran can get back its own identity which is different from the Islamic identity.Finally it brings out a potrait of the women of Iran - they can fight their own battle and do not need western sympathy - they understand their plight and they are involved in a struggle to change it - hope they can change - I have decided to buy this DVD",5,a classic in its own rights and domain,1219536000,"08 24, 2008",2008,2414,"['do', 'not', 'believe', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'deep', 'touching', 'animation', 'movie', 'absolute', 'wonder', 'domain', 'difficult', 'explain', 'hard', 'understand', 'Iran', 'not', 'Arab', 'Europe', 'culture', 'cultural', 'classes', 'religion', 'politics', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'complicated', 'Vincent', 'Paronnaud', 'Marjane', 'Satrapi', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'simplify', 'complex', 'issues', 'simple', 'story', 'seen', 'eyes', 'protagonist', 'Marjane', 'Satrapi', 'feel', 'very', 'strongly', 'probably', 'have', 'gone', 'many', 'similar', 'experiences', 'different', 'background', 'when', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'truth', 'almost', 'made', 'cry.We', 'are', 'used', 'Iran', 'depicted', 'CNN', 'George', 'Bush', 'Administration', 'very', 'narrow', 'politicized', 'view', 'Iran', 'Persia', 'country', 'enormous', 'cultural', 'roots', 'strong', 'social', 'fabric', 'islamic', 'rulers', 'can', 'not', 'destroy', 'so', 'easily', 'also', 'forget', 'realize', 'Islam', 'speacially', 'persian', 'version', 'was', 'not', 'aggressive', 'brutal', 'infact', 'gave', 'Rumi', 'Thye', 'movie', 'amazing', 'transformation', 'Iran', 'last', 'century', 'transformation', 'never', 'been', 'produced', 'so', 'lucidly', 'anywhere', 'also', 'subcultural', 'liberal', 'front', 'Iran', 'not', 'died', 'not', 'yet', 'still', 'can', 'germinate', 'back', 'again', 'protagonist', 'see', 'revolution', 'where', 'Shah', 'removed', 'war', 'Iraq', 'see', 'support', 'liberal', 'grandma', 'who', 'subculture', 'liberalism', 'never', 'died', 'movie', 'probably', 'biggest', 'difference', 'Iran', 'Arab', 'nations', 'Saudi', 'most', 'time', 'lump', 'Iran', 'same', 'category', 'Arab', 'nations', 'Persia', 'was', 'completely', 'different', 'world.Then', 'when', 'protagonist', 'Europe', 'studies', 'challenges', 'cultural', 'differences', 'inner', 'battle', 'identity', 'crisis', 'depiction', 'poetic', 'almost', 'somebody', 'reading', 'Albert', 'Camus', 'sometimes', 'inner', 'demons', 'wins', 'finally', 'hurdles', 'moves', 'forward', 'movie', 'ray', 'hope', 'Iran', 'can', 'get', 'back', 'own', 'identity', 'different', 'Islamic', 'identity.Finally', 'out', 'potrait', 'women', 'Iran', 'can', 'fight', 'own', 'battle', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'western', 'sympathy', 'understand', 'plight', 'are', 'involved', 'struggle', 'change', 'hope', 'can', 'change', 'have', 'decided', 'buy', 'DVD']",Persepolis

It is important to point out that even though this is an animated film, it is definitely not for children. Nonetheless, I firmly believe that this funny and somewhat wistful movie is a rare gem that teenagers and adults will appreciate in its full value.This film is based on the autobiography of one of its directors, Marjane Satrapi, a young woman that grew up in Iran, and lived there both before and after the Iranian revolution that established an Islamic Fundamentalist government, drastically reducing personal liberties and imposing a completely different lifestyle on its citizens, specially on women.Marjane's story allows us to see her as a young and enthusiastic child that shares her parents hopes regarding the new regime, and as a rebellious teenager that cannot understand the limitations that affect women in her country, and that is sent abroad by her parents in order to protect her. We suffer with Marjane when she tries to find herself in Austria, and understand her feelings when she decides to return to Iran in order to be with her family.What happens then? Well, you have to watch this film in order to find out that. All the same, I can let you know that I loved ""Persepolis"", and that I think that this simple and powerful film is highly likely to strike a cord in you.

I highly recommend checking that out as well, because there were a few things left out that I felt could have added a little more to the story.  I think for dramatic effect they left out the part of the book when she actually became good friends with her first college roommate and went home with her for Christmas and had a great time.

1117032,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000YAA68W,mirasreviews,"[2, 2]","""Persepolis"" is based on Marjane Satrapi's autobiographical graphic novels of her childhood and youth in Iran. Satrapi co-directed and co-wrote the film with Vincent Paronnaud, and she is careful to say that it should not be taken as a literal representation of her life, because the narrative technique in film is so different from graphic novels that some liberties are inevitable. The story begins in 1978 Tehran, as 9-year-old Marjane, with a childish and uncomprehending political eye, witnesses the last days of the Shah's regime. Initial optimism turns to fear as the nation's new leadership institutes Draconian reforms. Fearing for their outspoken daughter, Marjane's parents send her to high school in Vienna. After an eventful flirtation with Western culture, Marjane heads back to Tehran for university, family, and more frustration with that nation's oppressive religious regime.""Persepolis"" is created from hand-drawn animation, stark black-and-white foregrounds that tend to be against muted backgrounds. Though the characters are illustrated with relatively simple lines, the texture of other elements in the scenes is often pronounced and inviting. Marjane Satrapi chose to make an animated film in part because she wanted it to be abstract, not identified solely with a particular place and time, and not an ""ethnic"" film. She's correct in thinking that animation removes the ethnic quality, even from a film that takes place in a foreign country among people speaking a foreign language. The animation style is thoroughly enjoyable and deceptively simple. The clean lines focus attention on what is important, while peripheral elements create mood.I don't think that ""Persepolis"" has anything pointed to say. It expresses one person's experiences with passion and humor. Marjane laments what happened to her family and country. She remarks on the advantages and shortcomings of life in Europe. I think more than a commentary on Iran or oppressive governments, ""Persepolis"" expresses the conflicting emotions that immigrants from the developing world to the First World often feel: Contentment and optimism in the new opportunities that they enjoy. Frustration and nostalgia for their native countries that continue to struggle with basic social and economic issues. This is where ""Persepolis"" most succeeds and finds itself expressing thoughts and emotions common to millions of people. In French with optional subtitles.The DVD (Sony 2008): The film was recorded in French, but the directors also recorded an English version, so you can watch the film in either language or with subtitles in English or Spanish. There are 5 featurettes on the disc. Most are in French with subtitles. ""The Hidden Side of Persepolis"" (30 min) is a French making-of documentary. Satrapi takes us behind the scenes to meet the film's animators, cast, and other technicians, who explain their work. ""Behind the Scenes of Persepolis"" (9 min) was made for the English version. It interviews the director and some of the American cast. In ""Cannes Press Conference Q&A;"" (29 min), the directors, producers, and French cast take questions from the press. ""Selected Scene Commentaries"" presents 3 sequences with commentary by Satrapi, Paronnaud, or actress Chiara Mastroianni.

The brief, understated visions of war and its destruction -- blessedly free from sentiment, gore, or propaganda -- tear at the heart. The funny scenes were laugh-out-loud hilarious and a credit to the sensitive pen of the artist -- Marjane's exposure to punk rock brought back memories and had me laughing till I choked.

1117034,A1S5B32WYMEE44,B000YAA68W,"M. Swinney ""Marc My Words""","[11, 21]","Marjane Satrapi has indeed lived an interesting life.  Growing up in Iran and seeing a country and culture transform from the days of the Shah to all the turmoil that ensued in a revolution left her, her family, and her country devastingly reeling to find some semblance of a livable life.  Persepolis, graphically animates, Satrapi's comic book graphic novel of the same name and does it to great effect both with the story and with the art form.  Though I've rated it 3-stars, don't think it is a movie you should pass on.  Persepolis is what your friends will be talking about around the dinner table, at the local Starbucks, at Church, at your 4th of July bar-b-que.  Though the flick didn't live up to the high expectations I had for it, doesn't mean you shouldn't take the opportunity to immerse yourself in all things Persian to try to get a better understanding of a part of the world that has the single-most potential to be the next international conflict flash point.  Get to know Iran because it will be on center stage for years to come.The highlight of Persepolis is the animation. Though the physical depiction of the characters are somewhat one-dimensional, the animator Vincent Paronnaud uses light and color and unique shapes to enhance their emotions and the events of their lives.  There is one scene in which two older burkha wearing religious ladies acccost her on the streets for listening to punk music.  The shape of the ladies in their burkhas are almost amorphous, snake-like and the power of intimidation leaps out so much more than what it would have been if real actors played the characters.  Time and time again the animator uses the contrast of light and darkness to highlight a scene.  Many times there are the scene fade-outs where a white figure is left to the end burning itself in one's retina providing a subtle yet effective dramatic effect.I think of other adult animations and ones that really caught on and caught my attention did some different things either with the story or with the animation.  ""Heavy MetalHeavy Metal: Music From The Motion Picture,"" reached out to teens in the early 80's and then found a second life on the midnight movie circuit.  Though I was drawn in by the killer soundtrack featuring Sammy Hagar, Blue Oyster Cult, Devo and Sabbath; the movie tied in animation, music and story into a specifically teen targeted flick that stuck.  Or Richard Linkletter's ""Waking LifeWaking Life,"" that came out in 2003 has something so unique and creative about it that its take on philosophy stays with you years after you've watched it.

1117035,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B000YAA68W,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[3, 3]","Persepolis is a brilliantly constructed and beautifully animated film about a young girl growing up in Tehran during the Islamic revolution.  Based on an autobiographical graphic novel by Marjane Satrapi, her story is a sad one: of a young woman who cannot feel at home in an increasingly oppressive state (who digs punk rock and heavy metal and can't stand conformity) but feels out of place anywhere else.  At the same time, the author is clever and self-aware and never lets the story sink to the level of self-pity -- and doesn't shy away from self-criticism.The animation is unlike anything you are likely to have seen.  It matches the expressive simplicity of the graphic novels -- but has a vitality and wit that is uniquely cinematic.  It is another reminder that the possibilities of creative storytelling with animation are far from exhausted by the more mainstream approaches of Disney and Dreamworks, or even the wide ranging styles of Japanese Anime.One of the most touching elements of the story is its tribute to the strength and support of her parents.  While sometimes they are exasperated by her behavior they are never less than supportive.  Her grandmother, who understands her best, encourages her to hold on to her passion and spunk, but be wise in its expression.  A delightful and exciting work -- that is timely in its reminder that our perception of life in other countries should not be dictated exclusively by the stories that appear in the mainstream media.  This story, also, does not pretend to capture everything there is to know about Iran -- since it is merely the perspective of one young woman, but a perceptive and intelligent and thoughtful perspective.

Adapted for the screen by Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud, the film brings together both ""Persepolis"" and ""Persepolis 2""; so if you have a favorite scene from either book, you should be aware that some necessary telescoping has gone on, and therefore that favorite scene may, from your point of view, receive short shrift.  An advantage of this decision, on the other hand, is that while the film makes clear the brutality of the Islamist regime that took power in Iran after that nation's 1979 revolution, it also makes equally clear that life in the West (once the young Marjane Satrapi escapes from Iran and travels to Austria) has its own hazards.  The film reproduces well the stark black-and-white drawing style of the graphic novels (one of my students referred to the style as ""monochromatic minimalism""), with switches to color photography for a couple of crucial scenes.  While the film can't do everything that the graphic novels do (Satrapi is particularly artful at making individual panels larger or smaller for the sake of dramatic effect), the story translates very well to the motion-picture medium.  I prefer hearing the dialogue in the original French when I watch the film, but an English soundtrack is available as well.

It's not quite the same as watching a Superman or Wonder Woman animated film.  This film delves into the childhood and young adulthood of a young Iranian teenager/woman growing up in Iran and in Europe.  It's gives you a different perspective on things, but it actually isn't as different as one may imagine.  Aren't all of us young, one time in our lives and don't some of us have issues growing up as adolescents and aren't there always some economic, political, or family difficulties when we were growing up?  Sometimes, it's just a part of life.  These are the times in which we grow up.I just watch it for more of an entertainment value rather than a history lesson in Iranian life and politics or about growing up in Europe.  I found no need to argue or to to overanalyze the film, I accept it as an autobiographical work, done in an unusual, but entertaining format.Watching it in French with English subtitles is really funny.  I recall a scene with her falling in love with a Spaniard, and I had to laugh at how it turned out.  It probably was the most funny scene in the film.The nuns in Austria were hard on the girl.  Just imagine the ultra strict and tough nuns that you see in the film ""The Sound Of Music,"" without the sweet Maria and without any music and joy.The film is mostly done in a simplistic French cartoon style.

I did find it very charming, due to the animation.  I don't usually like animated films, even the ones that others like, so I was very pleasantly surprised at the tremendous charm of this.  Frame by frame, the expressions on the faces of the characters, their body language, the wit and the sheer beauty of the drawings captured my attention and pulled me along.The film is long and I broke it up into two settings.  The ending was abrupt and left me hanging.  This is where I look back at the structure of the story and find it wanting.  It is actually a narrative of the events of a young Iranian girl as she watched the political regime change in her country, then her brief stay in Austria, her return home and then her flight to Paris.  It's really an autobiography rather than a story and when viewed in that light, it's well done.  But somehow there is a ""so what?"" left at the end.We don't know what happens after the girl gets out of the taxi...Will she adapt better to French society than she did to Austrian?  What happens to her parents?  etc.  There were some other questions that arose in my mind as I watched it.  Why did she end up sleeping on the streets in Vienna, when it seemed that her parents had plenty of money?.  Why did she refuse to contact them for two months and then refuse to tell them what she did there?  Were there events that weren't shown?So anyway, structurally, as a story it doesn't hold together for me.

I am not a great fan of animated films, so it takes a lot of convincing for me to see one.  To me this story really is about coming of age, differences between middle east and western world and a girl stuck in between becoming the unwilling participant of the events around her.  Marjane is curious, smart and overbearing while her immediate and extended family take a great effort to raise her right so she can be a decent human being.  Her background story is about political uprising in Iran is really a story about social polarization betweeen left (communists) and right (fundamentalists).  Very similar to 1930s in Europe when Nazis were getting advantage in Europe.  Our main character's protective parents send her to Austria in order to protect her from the unstable political situation, but shelter away from one country never really is a shelter against emotional ravage a young girl becomes a part of while away from her parents.

As it turns out, it wasn't different at all, save for making certain parts of the book stand out in even starker contrast to their surrounding scenes (such as the embarrassingly awful ""Eye of the Tiger"" sequence, which I can't believe anyone involved with the movie wasn't horrified enough to excise before this thing ever made it to a theater).I'm the first to admit that my antipathy towards both book and movie stems from my dislike of memoirs, which tend to be the work of uninteresting people who have led uninteresting lives trying to cash in on the more interesting things that happened around them. Persepolis is no different in this regard (and Satrapi has since gone on two author more books, all of which are, unsurprisingly, either memoir or biography). If you're one of the millions who currently goes gaga over memoirs, you're probably going to love this. I don't like memoirs, and had the expected reaction.

As it turned out, I encountered the film before the book.  I had long wanted to see it after noticing the stellar reviews it received upon its release and because of the extreme outrage the film created in the Iranian government, which repeatedly requested that various countries not allow it to be shown.  I can understand why.  It is an unfiltered and uncensored insider's perspective on what life inside post-revolution Iran is like.  There is absolutely no question that life under the Shah was horrific.  It is also absolutely certain that life after the Shah has been just as bad or worse.I am a religious person and I certainly have no problem with anyone worrying about what God wants them to do.  I have a great deal of difficulty with people who think they know what God wants other people to do.  This film should not lead Americans into complacency.  There are millions of fundamentalist Americans who are just as certain that they know what you or I need to do to fulfill God's will as the religious zealots in Iran.  So this film should stand as a warning to us reaffirm diligently the separation between church and state.  We really, really don't want religion shaping our government.If PERSEPOLIS were merely about the dangers of religious fundamentalism taking over civil society this film might have pedagogical value but no more.  Luckily, it is a witty, charming, and deeply moving account of one person's life.  As Marjane Satrapi's real life story unfolds in animated form we come to feel deep compassion for the tragedy that has surrounded her childhood and youth.  We are also moved by the delight and joy she finds in life despite the religious zealots who want to micro manage and tightly control her thoughts and habits.  We also come to understand the impossibility of anything approaching a normal life in a society where self-appointed policemen (and the occasional policewomen) for God dominate everything.  The film is filled with dozens of amazing moments illustrating the absurdities that enforced religiosity creates.  My favorite may have been when Marjane goes to the black market where shifty looking men quietly hawk their wares, looking for all the world like drug dealers.  But instead of heroin or pot they are selling the Bee Gees and Julio Iglesias.  And you have to love it when Marjane refuses to succumb to religious pontification but instead goes back to her apartment to listen defiantly to Iron Maiden.This is a delightfully unique film.  We are used to non-animated films dealing with serious topics and as a result are somewhat steeled against them.  They are simply all too familiar.  But we aren't used to animation delving so deeply into such serious and profound matters, and as a result the film surprises us.  The film provides us with a grim and illuminating portrait of life in Iran since the late seventies, but it does something else besides:  it delights and entertains.",5,Not your typical coming of age film,1230249600,"12 26, 2008",2008,3043,"['had', 'long', 'intended', 'read', 'graphic', 'novel', 'film', 'based', 'see', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'encountered', 'film', 'book', 'had', 'long', 'wanted', 'see', 'noticing', 'stellar', 'reviews', 'received', 'release', 'extreme', 'outrage', 'film', 'created', 'Iranian', 'government', 'repeatedly', 'requested', 'various', 'countries', 'not', 'allow', 'be', 'shown', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'unfiltered', 'uncensored', 'insider', 'perspective', 'what', 'life', 'post-revolution', 'Iran', 'absolutely', 'question', 'life', 'Shah', 'was', 'horrific', 'also', 'absolutely', 'certain', 'life', 'Shah', 'been', 'just', 'bad', 'worse.I', 'am', 'religious', 'person', 'certainly', 'have', 'problem', 'anyone', 'worrying', 'what', 'God', 'do', 'have', 'great', 'deal', 'difficulty', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'know', 'what', 'God', 'other', 'people', 'do', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'lead', 'Americans', 'complacency', 'are', 'millions', 'fundamentalist', 'Americans', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'certain', 'know', 'what', 'need', 'do', 'fulfill', 'God', 'will', 'religious', 'zealots', 'Iran', 'So', 'film', 'should', 'stand', 'warning', 'reaffirm', 'diligently', 'separation', 'church', 'state', 'really', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'religion', 'shaping', 'government.If', 'PERSEPOLIS', 'were', 'merely', 'dangers', 'religious', 'fundamentalism', 'taking', 'over', 'civil', 'society', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'pedagogical', 'value', 'more', 'Luckily', 'witty', 'charming', 'deeply', 'moving', 'account', 'one', 'person', 'life', 'Marjane', 'Satrapi', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'unfolds', 'animated', 'form', 'come', 'feel', 'deep', 'compassion', 'tragedy', 'surrounded', 'childhood', 'youth', 'are', 'also', 'moved', 'delight', 'joy', 'life', 'religious', 'zealots', 'who', 'want', 'micro', 'manage', 'tightly', 'control', 'thoughts', 'habits', 'also', 'come', 'understand', 'impossibility', 'anything', 'approaching', 'normal', 'life', 'society', 'where', 'self-appointed', 'policemen', 'occasional', 'policewomen', 'God', 'dominate', 'everything', 'film', 'filled', 'dozens', 'amazing', 'moments', 'illustrating', 'absurdities', 'enforced', 'religiosity', 'creates', 'favorite', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'when', 'Marjane', 'black', 'market', 'where', 'shifty', 'looking', 'men', 'quietly', 'hawk', 'wares', 'looking', 'world', 'drug', 'dealers', 'instead', 'heroin', 'pot', 'are', 'selling', 'Bee', 'Gees', 'Julio', 'Iglesias', 'have', 'love', 'when', 'Marjane', 'succumb', 'religious', 'pontification', 'instead', 'back', 'apartment', 'listen', 'defiantly', 'Iron', 'Maiden.This', 'delightfully', 'unique', 'film', 'are', 'used', 'non-animated', 'films', 'dealing', 'serious', 'topics', 'result', 'are', 'somewhat', 'steeled', 'are', 'simply', 'too', 'familiar', 'are', ""n't"", 'used', 'animation', 'delving', 'so', 'deeply', 'such', 'serious', 'profound', 'matters', 'result', 'film', 'film', 'grim', 'illuminating', 'portrait', 'life', 'Iran', 'late', 'seventies', 'something', 'else', 'entertains']",Persepolis

Zwick,"[0, 0]","Movies don't come much more boldly original or stylistically unique than the animated hit ""Persepolis,"" an autobiographical tale of life under a totalitarian regime as seen through the eyes of a spirited Iranian girl named Marjane Satrapi, who, after immigrating to France, wrote the graphic novel upon which the film (co-directed by Satrapi herself) is based.  Satrapi was a wide-eyed, inquisitive youngster when, in 1978, the Shah of Iran was toppled and a new era of freedom appeared to be dawning for that nation's people.  Unfortunately, as is so often the case with revolutions, the new regime - in this case, the fundamentalist Islamic Republic led by the Ayatollah Khomeini- turned out to be even more cruel, dictatorial and repressive than the one that got overthrown.As the central character in the movie, Marjane is both an observer of and a participant in the many events that play out in the story, as any number of her own relatives and neighbors fall victim to the systematic purging of all those who refuse to adhere to the present regime`s newly enacted draconian measures (women must go out in burkas and head scarves, lovers are not allowed to hold hands in public, etc.) - while those who remain behind live in constant fear that they will find themselves in jail or up in front of a firing squad for a simple, perhaps even inadvertent, code violation.  Yet, despite all the bleakness and repression, hope and freedom of thought somehow miraculously flourish and prevail in the human heart, as exemplified by Marjane who refuses to yield her rebellious spirit (she buys bootleg Iron Maiden CDs from hawkers on the street) to the forces that would suppress and imprison it.In terms of style, ""Persepolis"" relies on old-school cell drawings rather than computer graphics for its animation.  The starkness of the times and of the setting is enhanced by the simple, ""flat"" look of the largely black-and-white drawings.  Yet, the movie is a veritable cornucopia of visual delights, thanks to the animators' generous use of surrealism and magical realism throughout the picture.  (If the movie reminds us of any one film, it is probably ""Yellow Submarine"").In quick, bold strokes, director Satrapi, along with her co-director Vincent Paronnaud and their team of expert animators, chronicles not only her own experience but that of an entire nation as well.",4,graphic novel come to life,1227398400,"11 23, 2008",2008,2370,"['Movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'much', 'more', 'boldly', 'original', 'stylistically', 'unique', 'animated', 'hit', 'Persepolis', 'autobiographical', 'tale', 'life', 'totalitarian', 'regime', 'seen', 'eyes', 'spirited', 'Iranian', 'girl', 'named', 'Marjane', 'Satrapi', 'who', 'immigrating', 'France', 'wrote', 'graphic', 'novel', 'film', 'co-directed', 'Satrapi', 'based', 'Satrapi', 'was', 'wide-eyed', 'inquisitive', 'youngster', 'when', '1978', 'Shah', 'Iran', 'was', 'toppled', 'new', 'era', 'freedom', 'appeared', 'be', 'dawning', 'nation', 'people', 'Unfortunately', 'so', 'often', 'case', 'revolutions', 'new', 'regime', 'case', 'fundamentalist', 'Islamic', 'Republic', 'led', 'Ayatollah', 'Khomeini-', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'cruel', 'dictatorial', 'repressive', 'one', 'got', 'central', 'character', 'movie', 'Marjane', 'observer', 'participant', 'many', 'events', 'play', 'out', 'story', 'number', 'own', 'relatives', 'neighbors', 'fall', 'victim', 'systematic', 'purging', 'who', 'refuse', 'adhere', 'present', 'regime', 's', 'newly', 'enacted', 'draconian', 'measures', 'women', 'must', 'go', 'out', 'burkas', 'head', 'scarves', 'lovers', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'hold', 'hands', 'public', 'etc', 'who', 'remain', 'live', 'constant', 'fear', 'will', 'find', 'jail', 'up', 'front', 'firing', 'squad', 'simple', 'perhaps', 'even', 'inadvertent', 'code', 'violation', 'bleakness', 'repression', 'hope', 'freedom', 'thought', 'somehow', 'miraculously', 'flourish', 'prevail', 'human', 'heart', 'exemplified', 'Marjane', 'who', 'yield', 'rebellious', 'spirit', 'bootleg', 'Iron', 'Maiden', 'CDs', 'hawkers', 'street', 'forces', 'would', 'suppress', 'imprison', 'it.In', 'terms', 'style', 'Persepolis', 'relies', 'old-school', 'cell', 'drawings', 'rather', 'computer', 'graphics', 'animation', 'starkness', 'times', 'setting', 'enhanced', 'simple', 'flat', 'look', 'largely', 'black-and-white', 'drawings', 'movie', 'veritable', 'cornucopia', 'visual', 'delights', 'thanks', 'animators', 'generous', 'use', 'surrealism', 'magical', 'realism', 'picture', 'movie', 'one', 'film', 'probably', 'Yellow', 'Submarine', '.In', 'quick', 'bold', 'strokes', 'director', 'Satrapi', 'co-director', 'Vincent', 'Paronnaud', 'team', 'expert', 'animators', 'chronicles', 'not', 'only', 'own', 'experience', 'entire', 'nation', 'well']",Persepolis

Just when the Shah is defeated and it seems some freedom may be restored to Iran a fundamental Islamic group comes to power and dashes all hope. So the viewer learns to navigate such dodgy waters as Marjane does, including what it means to be female under such a smothering regime, how one comes to terms with her own feelings of hatred and frustration, and how to find a way to thrive when everything around you opposes it.Try as she might, Marjane just can't keep her rebellious self under wraps and her parents feel it's best to send her to Europe to be educated. Meeting a very different kind of adversity there, Marjane comes to see just what freedoms she has missed out on and how western culture doesn't even know how blessed it is. Upon returning to Iran as a young adult Marjane falls into a deep depression, leading to a rocky marriage and sad realization that while she genuinely loves her homeland she knows she will never prosper there.Based on the autobiographical graphical novel of the same name, Persepolis is brilliantly done. Written and directed by Marjane Satrapi, herself, the coming-of-age story allows us to grow and develop with the young heroine, to feel frankly the hurt of a child's dreams not realized in the adult's life. The stark and contrasting black and white animation is evocative and powerful, no doubt a mirror to having grown up in a place that as much creates open space for growth it also embodies the restricting darkness that inhibits it.

Finally Marji returns to Iran and you experience the alienation and dissatisfaction she feels as she tried to readjust to Iranian life. As a child Marji is inquisitive and endearing and her sense of independence, although lost at times, is never far below the surface as she grows up.

1117057,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000YAA68W,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[24, 26]","Marjane Satrapi, lives with her parents (voiced by Catherine Deneuve and Simon Abkarian) in Iran during the difficult times leading up to and from the removal of the Shah. Marjane frequently spends time with her grandmother (voiced by Danielle Darrieux) who bristles at the new restrictions placed on women. As Marjane (voiced by Chianni Mastrianni) grows up, she learns about new things, including rock music, and wears band t-shirts under her traditional dress, attends parties to make out with boys, and has remarkable luck staying one step ahead of the police. Eventually, things become so bad in Iran, and everyone realizes Marjane will never reach her full potential there, that she is sent to live in Vienna. Later, she returns, heartbroken, and can't handle the religious and political pressures placed on the young people of her generation. She eventually immigrates to France.Strangely, what I have just described is the synopsis for the new animated film ""Persepolis"". This new film from France has been winning many awards and garnering a lot of attention. Even more strangely, Marjane Satrapi bases it on semi-autobiographical graphic novels. The idea alone is enough to garner the project attention, but the end result is very good, giving us a fascinating look at the life of one girl who grew up in a difficult time, in a difficult place, and chose a fairly unique way to tell her story.Satrapi's drawing style is eye-catching. Seemingly very simplistic, she catches a lot of detail by showing the pattern on a dress, for example, to make the drawing seem more significant than a simple black and white line drawing. Throughout, she captures little details like this, allowing us to get a glimpse of what life was like in this tumultuous part of the country's history.Satrapi and her co-director Vincent Paronnaud, have adapted the unique look of Satrapi's graphic novels to this film. I am glad the people backing this film gave her the freedom to retain this unique visual look, rather than try to use CGI or more realistic animation. In a way, this more simplistic style lends itself better to the tone and scope of the story. Yes, there are a lot of larger things happening around her, but the story is about Marjane and her family, and needs to remain fairly intimate. Because the filmmakers stick with the style originated by Marjane, probably be at home in a newspaper comic strip, the film seems to convey Marjane's plight in a more realistic way.I have read Marjane has been very influenced by Italian Neorealism and German Expressionism and this is very evident in her drawing style. As Marjane hears stories of other family members, the drawings take on the appearance of woodcuts, moving in a stilted, jangled fashion. These moments also help to reinforce the romantic nature a child would give to these horrific events. Stories become fairy tales to young boys and girls, so Marjane is unable to realize the events being described are real or dangerous, and gives them a romantic, daring edge while they are scaring her. There is an old silent animated film called ""The Adventures of Prince Achmed"". In this film, the characters are all paper cuts and the animation is done by moving these figures every frame or so. This style is so closely related to fairy tales it is almost impossible to think of anything else when you see it.The film is also largely composed in black and white, with brief moments of color at the beginning and end. These moments help to highlight the fact the bulk of the story is a remembrance, a dream of a time past. All of these choices are the right choices and help to make this story right, giving us a real feel for what Marjane experienced growing up in this environment.As Marjane gets older, she becomes more rebellious and more daring. She buys bootleg copies of her favorite rock musicians, wears a Michael Jackson button underneath her traditional Muslim wear, and attends parties with boys. But all of these things are strictly forbidden and she and her friends have to be teenagers in a fairly clandestine environment, adding an element of danger to the evening.As Marjane gets older, she also begins to question authority and lash out at the people in charge. These activities coincide with the growing unrest in their country, and the government's increased efforts on cracking down on these same activities. Her parents realize the country will only get worse before it gets better, so they arrange for Marjane to live in Vienna. With this newfound freedom, Marjane goes a little wild and finds it difficult to live with her host family.She eventually returns to Iran, a more confident, headstrong, rebellious woman. As she grows, so does the crackdown imposed by the government and things are worse than ever. But life in Vienna also beat Marjane down a bit and she returns a bit defeated, a bit worse for wear. She tries to live up to the ideals imposed by the government, and becomes depressed by having so many civil liberties taken away. A well-timed conversation with her grandmother leads her to take the next step and move to Paris, leaving her family behind.""Persepolis"" is almost instantly engaging; the style of animation and the portrayal of a young Marjane draw the viewer into this world. As Marjane grows, we learn about this country, it's struggles, and more importantly Marjane's struggles to live in such a place. And during the final moments of the film, ""Persepolis"" is a very moving film; the intimate story has really given us a feel for Marjane, her parents and her grandmother, and their struggles. As we watch Marjane leave all of this behind, for a new life, it is very difficult to feel anything but moved.The most amazing thing about ""Persepolis"" is that it is more real, more touching and more emotional than most other films. And it is animated.",5,"More Human, More Touching, More Emotional Than Most Live Action Films",1201737600,"01 31, 2008",2008,5847,"['Marjane', 'Satrapi', 'parents', 'voiced', 'Catherine', 'Deneuve',

1117059,A2YKADCJME4FSW,B000YAA68W,Tom Birkenstock,"[0, 0]","Persepolis is a kind of film rarely seen in America: an animated film for adults. When I say ""adult"" I'm not referring to the ultra-violent zaniness found in Japanese animation or the double entendres meant to go over children's heads in movies like Shrek, I'm referring to a complicated protagonist attempting to simultaneously understand and manage overpowering change in the world around her. I don't think Bugs Bunny had the same depth of problems that Marjane Satrapi has (of course, I supposed he was struggling with living in Hobbes's nature during that whole rabbit season/duck season debacle). Even referencing Bugs seems a bit silly since animation has supposedly evolved to encompass many genres beyond children's film. Or at least outside of the United States boarders it has, and I'm sure no one would be surprised to learn that Persepolis has French subtitles.Persepolis is based on an autobiographical comic book by Marjane Satrapi about growing up in Iran, being sent to Europe during her adolescents, and returning as she transitions into an adult. Growing up during the Iranian revolution, Marjane has a sense of wonder about the chaos around her. She becomes particularly intrigued by her uncle, a communist who was jailed and was only recently released from prison. Fueled by her uncle's stories and her parents political involvement she rallies a group of neighborhood kids to chase the son of an Iranian torturer so that they can gouge out his eyes with nails. They are stopped by an adult before the bloody deed is done. Marjane even begins talking back to her teacher in school, contradicting the Iranian status quo. After the Ayatollah comes to power Marjane's family fears what will happen to their outspoken daughter and decide to send her with some friends in Europe.Once in Europe Marjane wrestles with the travails of puberty while trying to reconcile her exotic Iranian heritage with her adolescent need to fit in. At first she stays at a Catholic boarding school, but when one of the nuns affronts Iranians Marjane makes the uncouth comment that all nuns were once prostitutes. This leads to her moving out into a series of living arrangements as well as a string of boyfriends. When she discovers one of her boyfriends in bed with another woman, Marjane becomes despondent and gets kicked out of her apartment and winds up living on the streets. It would be easy to shrug off Marjane's self-destructive behavior as her being a self-involved teen. It would be easy except that when Marjane wakes up in a hospital from malnutrition she chastises herself for becoming upset over a relationship when her own uncle was subject to incarceration for merely speaking his mind. It's this kind of self-reflection that prevents the film from falling into the kind of narcissism that plagues so many other coming of age stories. After her brush with death Marjane decides to return to Iran where she must confront the intolerance of a government run by a religion.Like the comic book the animation is deceptively simple. The film is mostly black and white and the characters are drawn with thick lines. Anyone who's read the comic book will wonder whether they fit in most of the original medium. While the filmmakers do a good job at referencing many of Marjane's stories, many of the vignettes are necessarily truncated. However, this is hardly a downfall of the film which utilizes animation to communicate Marjane's tale as succinctly as possible. When she falls in love with a boy, for example, we see her floating above the ground with him, which, for a teenage romance, is just about all the audience needs to know. Each moment of the film is, like the animation, told clearly and simply, but as the film moves forward the moments gather greater strength. It's like the filmmakers are putting down one pebble after anther until, before you know it, they've constructed an entire wall.The intellectual middle class nature of Marjane's family seems so familiar that I often found myself wondering what I would do if suddenly transplanted in a country where you could be jailed for walking with someone of the opposite sex who wasn't related to you and, worst of all, alcohol was banned. Persepolis is a needed reminder that small minded rulers too often rule over a more enlightened populace (it says something that the same sentence could describe the state of today's America). For all the talk of cultural differences, it should be remembered that certain ideals can be disseminated by dialogue, even if they're unsuccessfully translated through the barrel of a gun.",5,Foreign Culture that Looks a Lot Like Ours,1314662400,"08 30, 2011",2011,4595,"['Persepolis', 'kind', 'film', 'rarely', 'seen', 'America', 'animated', 'film', 'adults', 'When', 'say', 'adult', ""'m"", 'not', 'referring', 'ultra-violent', 'zaniness', 'found', 'Japanese', 'animation', 'double', 'entendres', 'meant', 'go', 'over', 'children', 'heads', 'movies', 'Shrek', ""'m"", 'referring', 'complicated', 'protagonist', 'attempting', 'simultaneously', 'understand', 'manage', 'overpowering', 'change', 'world', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Bugs', 'Bunny', 'had', 'same', 'depth', 'problems', 'Marjane', 'Satrapi', 'course', 'supposed', 'was', 'struggling', 'living', 'Hobbes', 'nature', 'whole', 'rabbit', 'season/duck', 'season', 'debacle', 'Even', 'referencing', 'Bugs', 'bit', 'silly', 'animation', 'supposedly', 'evolved', 'encompass', 'many', 'genres', 'children', 'film', 'least', 'United', 'States', 'boarders', ""'m"", 'sure', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'surprised', 'learn', 'Persepolis', 'French', 'subtitles.Persepolis', 'based', 'autobiographical', 'comic', 'book', 'Marjane', 'Satrapi', 'growing', 'up', 'Iran', 'being', 'sent', 'Europe', 'adolescents', 'returning', 'adult', 'Growing', 'up', 'Iranian', 'revolution', 'Marjane', 'sense', 'wonder', 'chaos', 'particularly', 'intrigued', 'uncle', 'communist', 'who', 'was', 'jailed', 'was', 'only', 'recently', 'released', 'prison', 'Fueled', 'uncle', 'stories', 'parents', 'political', 'involvement', 'group', 'neighborhood', 'kids', 'chase', 'son', 'Iranian', 'torturer', 'can', 'gouge', 'out', 'eyes', 'nails', 'are', 'stopped', 'adult', 'bloody', 'deed', 'done', 'Marjane', 'even', 'talking', 'back', 'teacher', 'school', 'contradicting', 'Iranian', 'status', 'quo', 'Ayatollah', 'power', 'Marjane', 'family', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'outspoken', 'daughter', 'decide', 'send', 'friends', 'Europe.Once', 'Europe', 'Marjane', 'travails', 'puberty', 'trying', 'reconcile', 'exotic', 'Iranian', 'heritage', 'adolescent', 'need', 'fit', 'first', 'Catholic', 'boarding', 'school', 'when', 'one', 'nuns', 'affronts', 'Iranians', 'Marjane', 'uncouth', 'comment', 'nuns', 'were', 'once', 'prostitutes', 'moving', 'out', 'series', 'living', 'arrangements', 'as', 'well', 'string', 'boyfriends', 'When', 'one', 'boyfriends', 'bed', 'woman', 'Marjane', 'despondent', 'kicked', 'apartment', 'up', 'living', 'streets', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'shrug', 'off', 'Marjane', 'self-destructive', 'behavior', 'being', 'self-involved', 'teen', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'when', 'Marjane', 'up', 'hospital', 'malnutrition', 'becoming', 'upset', 'relationship', 'when', 'own', 'uncle', 'was', 'subject', 'incarceration', 'merely', 'speaking', 'mind', 'kind', 'self-reflection', 'film', 'falling', 'kind', 'narcissism', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'coming', 'age', 'stories', 'brush', 'death', 'Marjane', 'return', 'Iran', 'where', 'must', 'confront', 'intolerance', 'government', 'run', 'religion.Like', 'comic', 'book', 'animation', 'deceptively', 'simple', 'film', 'mostly', 'black', 'white', 'characters', 'are', 'drawn', 'thick', 'lines', 'Anyone', 'who', 'read', 'comic', 'book', 'will', 'wonder', 'fit', 'most', 'original', 'medium', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'referencing', 'many', 'Marjane', 'stories', 'many', 'vignettes', 'are', 'necessarily', 'truncated', 'However', 'hardly', 'downfall', 'film', 'animation', 'communicate', 'Marjane', 'tale', 'as', 'succinctly', 'possible', 'When', 'love', 'boy', 'example', 'see', 'floating', 'ground', 'teenage', 'romance', 'just', 'audience', 'know', 'moment', 'film', 'animation', 'told', 'clearly', 'simply', 'film', 'forward', 'moments', 'gather', 'greater', 'strength', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'putting', 'down', 'one', 'pebble', 'anther', 'know', ""'ve"", 'constructed', 'entire', 'wall.The', 'intellectual', 'middle', 'class', 'nature', 'Marjane', 'family', 'so', 'familiar', 'often', 'found', 'wondering', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'suddenly', 'transplanted', 'country', 'where', 'could', 'be', 'jailed', 'walking', 'someone', 'opposite', 'sex', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'related', 'worst', 'alcohol', 'was', 'banned', 'Persepolis', 'needed', 'reminder', 'small', 'minded', 'rulers', 'too', 'often', 'more', 'enlightened', 'populace', 'something', 'same', 'sentence', 'could', 'describe', 'state', 'today', 'America', 'talk', 'cultural', 'differences', 'should', 'be', 'remembered', 'certain', 'ideals', 'can', 'be', 'disseminated', 'dialogue', 'even', ""'re"", 'unsuccessfully', 'translated', 'barrel', 'gun']",Persepolis
1117060,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B000YAA68W,trashcanman,"[72, 75]","""Persepolis"" is an animated film based on Marjane Satrapi's autobiographicalgraphic novelof the same name about her childhood in Tehran during the last Iranian revolution and coming of age after emigrating to Vienna.  It is an extraordinarily ordinary story about an average woman coming to terms with herself and with the world around her.  Did I say ""average woman""?  My bad.  I meant dynamic, charming, intelligent, and fiercely individualistic.  Ms. Satrapi's story is among the finest works ever animated and bestows upon the viewer the endless virtues of knowledge, a broadened mind, and a true perspective on humanity.  ""Persepolis"" will break your heart, make you smile and laugh out loud, cheer, possibly sing, and restore your faith in humanity.  The fact that this was passed over for an Oscar in favor of yet another mediocre Pixar effort (about a rat that controls a chef by pulling his hair, no less) is the ultimate proof positive that that award (or any other, really) has no merit whatsoever.Young Marji walks down the street to the place where shady characters reside.  As she passes each bootlegger, they whisper the names of the forbidden fruit they possess.  ""Lipstick"" whispers one, ""Jichael Mackson"" mispronounces another. She continues on until she hears what she wants: ""Iron Maiden"".  She quickly negotiates a price and makes off with her prize just as a group of overbearing religious figures tower over her.  They have taken issue with her shoes: plain sneakers.  Marjie insists they are for basketball, but another spots her Michael Jackson patch, a symbol of American greed.  Then the coup-de-gras; she has ""punk is not dead"" scrawled across the back of her outfit.  Thinking fast, Marjie bursts into tears, sobbing lies about her parents having died in the war with the Iraqis and a cruel guardian who will burn her with an iron if they turn her in.  Safely back at home, having tricked the local oppressive religious posse, the young girl grabs a tennis racket as a guitar and bangs her head to the sweet, hard-earned reward of heavy metal.  The scene then segues -music still rocking- to the frontlines of the war where the new Iranian Islamic rulers are sending young men unarmed to rush the Iraqi army, acting as human shields/martyrs.  Their parents are rewarded by the government for their sons' sacrifices with little plastic keys which are promised to open the door to Heaven for their dead children.  Such are the complications of everyday life in Iran at this time.  The duality of these scenes speaks a lot for the power and message of this film.  But while there is highly enlightening political commentary and historical information to be found here, the focus is on the everyday life and struggles of our protagonist with the horrors of her surrounding often being downplayed.The animation is minimalist art of the highest stylistic brilliance.  The endearing nature of Marjie and her family is only highlighted by the ultra-simplistic black and white pencil-and-paper artwork.  All of the CG in the world could not improve on this film in any way; the focus is on story, characters, and stylistic integrity, as it should be.  The film's philosophies run deep and broad, ranging from harsh commentaries on authority to harsh commentary on purposeless counterculture.  Wisdom comes from Marjie's grandmother, from her imaginary chats with God, and her memories of her communist uncle.  These are life lessons about integrity, prudence, and acceptance that one should always carry with them and produce many, many quotable quotes.Do not think for a second that this film is all about heaviness of spirit and preachiness.  No, no, no, no; nothing could be further from the truth.  Ms. Satrapi is a brilliant social satyrist who fills ""Persepolis"" with pointed jokes, lighthearted moments, and heartwarming charm while pointing out that at heart, we are all the same.  There is a time in Marjie's life where she becomes a lifeless, jaded cynic unable to do anything but watch TV and let life pass her by.  Then one day, she wakes up angry again.  The result is a musical montage that will likely make you laugh hysterically or jump out of your seat to sing along.  Possiby both.  This is just that kind of film.  Throw in some animated love forGodzilla,Bruce Lee, andTerminator 2and I am beyond sold.The DVD has a few behind-the-scenes special features that show us the woman herself at work.  Having already fallen in love with her animated doppelganger, seeing the vivacious Marjane Satrapi made flesh is a real treat.  We get a view of the old-school animation processes and are able to watch Ms. Satropi act out different characters for the animators to see. This is nearly as much fun as the movie itself.  Wonderful feature.This is a near-perfect film that I would recommend to anybody who isn't going to run away from a mostly black and white animated film with subtitles.  And if you are: well, enjoy your life of closed-minded cinematic ignorance.  ""Persepolis"" is a revelation whose duty is to entertain us while reminding us just how good we have it and simultaneously educating us about a culture and history few in the West have made any attempt to understand.  Ms. Satropi's insisted that this story be animated and not filmed for this reason: animated characters are more universally identifiable.  Set a film in Iran and fill it with Iranians and you have an ethic film that many will subconsciously refuse to identify with.  But with animation, all things are possible; even bridging a gaping cultural divide.  But at it's heart, this is a film about the enthusiam of youth, the hardships of adulthood, and the triumph of personal integrity.

1117061,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000YAA68W,Tsuyoshi,"[6, 6]","(The following review refers to the original French version.)""Persepolis"" is a French animation with a bitter-sweet story. It is about Marjane Satrapi (or ""Marji""), only daughter to Iranian family living in Tehran. This is an autobiographical film that covers the life of Marjane Satrapi (who wrote the original graphic novels and also co-directed this film with Vincent Paronnaud) from the year 1978 when Marji was a 9-year-old girl who is a big fan of Bruce Lee. The time was just before the Revolution happens in Iran and Marji's coming-of-age story unfolds against the background of the modern Iranian history since then.The fast-paced narrative of the film is brilliant, especially in the first half which shows the impact the Iranian Revolution gave to the ordinary people, all seen from the perspective of Marji (Chiara Mastroianni as teenager and adult). Marji's parents (voice by Simon Abkarian and Catherine Deneuve) welcome the big social changes at first, but soon start to fear as their acquaintances start to leave the country or just vanish. Then a war breaks out.The film is historical and even political, but its story has also a personal aspect which would appeal universally. Marji slowly realizes what is going on around her after the Revolution, but naturally rebellious girl Marji no longer feels comfortable. Knowing that Marji talked back to her teacher at school, her worried parents (and they have to worry because they know the worst possible scenario waiting for her) decide to send her to Vienna. But still Marji senses that she does not belong to Europe either....Episodic nature of the film may be a little disappointing to some viewers. Most of the European characters are unmemorable, compared with the colorful Iranian characters surrounding Marji, especially Marji's wise grandmother (voice by Danielle Darrieux) who is outstanding. Obviously Marji's story (real-life or fictional) is very large and the film's second half would be better with less episodes or the film needs more time to allow us to get emotionally involved with the story, its romantic part in particular.Except three brief segments about the Paris airport, the film is shot in black and white, or I should say, black in combination of white and grey. The hand-drawn type animation creates the mood of each scene effectively with sparse soundtrack - sometime grim, sometimes funny and often beautiful (opening credit should not be missed).""Persepolis"" is a film about a life of a person. The person herself may not be perfect, but her story is universal.",5,"(4.5 STARS) Imaginative Animation and Fascinating Tale of Marjane ""Marji"" Satrapi",1200960000,"01 22, 2008",2008,2558,"['following', 'review', 'refers', 'original', 'French', 'version', 'Persepolis', 'French', 'animation', 'bitter-sweet', 'story', 'Marjane', 'Satrapi', 'Marji', 'only', 'daughter', 'Iranian', 'family', 'living', 'Tehran', 'autobiographical', 'film', 'life', 'Marjane', 'Satrapi', 'who', 'wrote', 'original', 'graphic', 'novels', 'also', 'co-directed', 'film', 'Vincent', 'Paronnaud', 'year', '1978', 'when', 'Marji', 'was', '9-year-old', 'girl', 'who', 'big', 'fan', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'time', 'was', 'just', 'Revolution', 'Iran', 'Marji', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'unfolds', 'background', 'modern', 'Iranian', 'history', 'then.The', 'fast-paced', 'narrative', 'film', 'brilliant', 'especially', 'first', 'half', 'impact', 'Iranian', 'Revolution', 'gave', 'ordinary', 'people', 'seen', 'perspective', 'Marji', 'Chiara', 'Mastroianni', 'teenager', 'adult', 'Marji', 'parents', 'voice', 'Simon', 'Abkarian', 'Catherine', 'Deneuve', 'welcome', 'big', 'social', 'changes', 'first', 'soon', 'start', 'fear', 'acquaintances', 'start', 'leave', 'country', 'just', 'vanish', 'Then', 'war', 'out.The', 'film', 'historical', 'even', 'political', 'story', 'also', 'personal', 'aspect', 'would', 'appeal', 'universally', 'Marji', 'slowly', 'what', 'going', 'Revolution', 'naturally', 'rebellious', 'girl', 'Marji', 'no', 'longer', 'comfortable', 'Knowing', 'Marji', 'talked', 'back', 'teacher', 'school', 'worried', 'parents', 'have', 'worry', 'know', 'worst', 'possible', 'scenario', 'waiting', 'decide', 'send', 'Vienna', 'still', 'Marji', 'not', 'belong', 'Europe', '.Episodic', 'nature', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'disappointing', 'viewers', 'Most', 'European', 'characters', 'are', 'unmemorable', 'compared', 'colorful', 'Iranian', 'characters', 'surrounding', 'Marji', 'especially', 'Marji', 'wise', 'grandmother', 'voice', 'Danielle', 'Darrieux', 'who', 'outstanding', 'Obviously', 'Marji', 'story', 'real-life', 'fictional', 'very', 'large', 'film', 'second', 'half', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'less', 'episodes', 'film', 'more', 'time', 'allow', 'get', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'story', 'romantic', 'part', 'particular.Except', 'three', 'brief', 'segments', 'Paris', 'airport', 'film', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'should', 'say', 'black', 'combination', 'white', 'grey', 'hand-drawn', 'type', 'animation', 'mood', 'scene', 'effectively', 'sparse', 'soundtrack', 'sometime', 'grim', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'often', 'beautiful', 'opening', 'credit', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'Persepolis', 'film', 'life', 'person', 'person', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'perfect', 'story', 'universal']",Persepolis

1117063,AUTBHG6070SL4,B000YAA68W,"wiredweird ""wiredweird""","[11, 12]","Marjane Satrapi presents the first part of her autobiographical series, based on the graphic novel of the same name. For those of you who haven't read the book, this movie has little in the way of plot - well, that's true of most people's lives. Instead, the fascination comes from the movie's sense of reality. Marji starts as a precocious and sometimes scary little girl of six or so, and matures into her early twenties as we watch. She gives some idea of what a child sees in the blast rubble that used to be a neighbor's house (and what used to be the neighbor). When she attends school, we see her as the permanent outsider, among but never truly of her peers' society. Then, when she returns to her family in Teheran, she brings her European sensibility into a nation teetering on the edge of repressive theocracy. She has become a stranger in her own country and family, and maybe in her own life.A few things leap out at a Western viewer. One might be Marjane's intense political awareness, from a very early age. It makes sense, though. She's a grand-daughter very few generations away from someone who ruled Iran, then was overthrown a handful of overthrows ago. In a nation where clan feuds recall events hundreds of years back, that puts her practically on the front line, even as a child. Her family name, Satrapi, long ago entered the English language as ""satrap,"" a mid-eastern ruler. No wonder she went to sleep with bedtime stories of her uncle's imprisonment and torture.The other striking feature of this movie is its stark visual style. People are simple line drawings, with blocky black or white patches for clothing. Backgrounds generally resemble ink wash on a rough-surfaced watercolor paper. Color doesn't exist until the very last moment - perhaps a foreshadowing of a sequel to come, more than an actual part of this movie's narrative. The simplicity won't appeal to everyone. As much as I like animation and graphic novels, I have mixed feelings about it. Still, I can't imagine this plain, stark story being told in any visual idiom less plain and stark than the movie's. Somehow, it all blends perfectly into a coming of age story that leaves triteness behind in the political prisons or urban battlefields of Marjane's growing-up years.-- wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release.",4,Growing up in a war zone,1202342400,"02 7, 2008",2008,2316,"['Marjane', 'Satrapi', 'first', 'part', 'autobiographical', 'series', 'based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'little', 'way', 'plot', 'well', 'true', 'most', 'people', 'lives', 'Instead', 'fascination', 'movie', 'sense', 'reality', 'Marji', 'precocious', 'sometimes', 'scary', 'little', 'girl', 'six', 'so', 'early', 'twenties', 'watch', 'idea', 'what', 'child', 'blast', 'rubble', 'used', 'be', 'neighbor', 'house', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'neighbor', 'When', 'school', 'see', 'permanent', 'outsider', 'never', 'truly', 'peers', 'society', 'Then', 'when', 'family', 'Teheran', 'European', 'sensibility', 'nation', 'teetering', 'edge', 'repressive', 'theocracy', 'become', 'stranger', 'own', 'country', 'family', 'maybe', 'own', 'life.A', 'few', 'things', 'leap', 'out', 'Western', 'viewer', 'One', 'might', 'be', 'Marjane', 'intense', 'political', 'awareness', 'very', 'early', 'age', 'sense', 'though', 'grand-daughter', 'very', 'few', 'generations', 'away', 'someone', 'who', 'ruled', 'Iran', 'then', 'was', 'overthrown', 'handful', 'overthrows', 'ago', 'nation', 'where', 'clan', 'recall', 'events', 'hundreds', 'years', 'back', 'practically', 'front', 'line', 'even', 'child', 'family', 'name', 'Satrapi', 'long', 'ago', 'entered', 'English', 'language', 'satrap', 'mid-eastern', 'ruler', 'wonder', 'went', 'sleep', 'bedtime', 'stories', 'uncle', 'imprisonment', 'torture.The', 'other', 'striking', 'feature', 'movie', 'stark', 'visual', 'style', 'People', 'are', 'simple', 'line', 'drawings', 'blocky', 'black', 'white', 'patches', 'clothing', 'Backgrounds', 'generally', 'resemble', 'ink', 'wash', 'rough-surfaced', 'watercolor', 'paper', 'Color', ""n't"", 'exist', 'very', 'last', 'moment', 'perhaps', 'foreshadowing', 'sequel', 'come', 'more', 'actual', 'part', 'movie', 'narrative', 'simplicity', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'everyone', 'As', 'much', 'like', 'animation', 'graphic', 'novels', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'Still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'plain', 'stark', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'visual', 'idiom', 'plain', 'stark', 'movie', 'Somehow', 'perfectly', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'triteness', 'political', 'prisons', 'urban', 'battlefields', 'Marjane', 'growing-up', 'years.', 'wiredweird', 'reviewing', 'theatrical', 'release']",Persepolis
