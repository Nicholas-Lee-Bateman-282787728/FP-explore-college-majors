This anime series is only season 1 & 2. Season 3 is my hope it would be soon. This show is amazing, slice of life, adventure and very educational. Very rear does an anime does such as to educate, this anime is about how the market works. From their, they add a slice of life and a great adventure to make it spice and wolf. From good moments to sad, from jealousy to needing someone you like. From rich to poor to hopefully of a fortune. I can keep going, but think I will bored you. Lol the DVD set come in DVD format and Blu-Ray DVD. They are in their own case, some share from front and back case. Animation is amazing, soundtrack is glamurous and the story is excellent.

Turns out she's a Wolf God of Harvest that lost her worshipers when Christianity came in and she's desperate to get back home to the north to spend her days in peace. He reluctantly agrees to take her but only if it's along his way. So she ends up tagging along on his business ventures adding her cute and mischievous talents to them . A friendship grows and more.

1550778,AFV2584U13XP3,B008D1RDIU,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[1, 1]","The series will definitely appeal to many fans once they see the series after an episode or two though if you like more of the action fast paced series like Naruto or Bleach then this one might not be for you.  The series while somewhat slow paced in certain areas is understandable as the writers give you a chance to better know the characters and the situation as the couple travel on their journey, The main two characters are Kraft Lawrence a wandering merchant who during his traveling meets a apparently young woman named Holo who he later finds out is Wolf harvest deity who feels her time has come with staying in the area but also as the villagers who once worshiped her have now started to forsake and forget about her and so wishes to see how the world has changed. The two quickly endear themselves to you with their quirk personalities and plans.  The series has a decent mixture of most genres in it so most people will probably find entertainment in watching the series though again while the series does have action scenes for the most part they creators and writers keep the pace on a more normal pace if you've seen the series [...] then you'll probably be used to the pace of this series as well.The animation is pretty decent and the soundtrack fits the series nicely of course the subbed and dubbed cast were very talented in voicing their character roles, the set itself is pretty much the standard from Funimation combo packs.  The set will give you four regular dvds and four blu-ray dvds, the extras are so-so but I and I think a few others rarely look at the extras so it's not a big issue.  At the end a great series awaits you and for other fans of fast paced animes I say give the series a shot you might be astounded at how entertaining the series really is...",5,A Entertaining Series With A Equally Good Storyline,1353024000,"11 16, 2012",2012,1791,"['series', 'will', 'definitely', 'appeal', 'many', 'fans', 'once', 'see', 'series', 'episode', 'two', 'like', 'more', 'action', 'fast', 'paced', 'series', 'Naruto', 'Bleach', 'then', 'one', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'series', 'somewhat', 'slow', 'paced', 'certain', 'areas', 'understandable', 'writers', 'give', 'chance', 'better', 'know', 'characters', 'situation', 'couple', 'travel', 'journey', 'main', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'Kraft', 'Lawrence', 'wandering', 'merchant', 'who', 'traveling', 'meets', 'apparently', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Holo', 'who', 'later', 'out', 'Wolf', 'harvest', 'deity', 'who', 'time', 'come', 'staying', 'area', 'also', 'villagers', 'who', 'once', 'worshiped', 'have', 'now', 'started', 'forsake', 'forget', 'so', 'wishes', 'see', 'how', 'world', 'changed', 'two', 'quickly', 'endear', 'quirk', 'personalities', 'plans', 'series', 'decent', 'mixture', 'most', 'genres', 'so', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'entertainment', 'watching', 'series', 'again', 'series', 'have', 'action', 'scenes', 'most', 'part', 'creators', 'writers', 'keep', 'pace', 'more', 'normal', 'pace', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'series', '[', ']', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'used', 'pace', 'series', 'well.The', 'animation', 'pretty', 'decent', 'soundtrack', 'series', 'nicely', 'course', 'subbed', 'dubbed', 'cast', 'were', 'very', 'talented', 'voicing', 'character', 'roles', 'set', 'pretty', 'much', 'standard', 'Funimation', 'combo', 'packs', 'set', 'will', 'give', 'four', 'regular', 'dvds', 'four', 'blu-ray', 'dvds', 'extras', 'are', 'so-so', 'think', 'few', 'others', 'rarely', 'look', 'extras', 'not', 'big', 'issue', 'end', 'great', 'series', 'awaits', 'other', 'fans', 'fast', 'paced', 'animes', 'say', 'give', 'series', 'shot', 'might', 'be', 'astounded', 'how', 'entertaining', 'series', 'really']",N/A

The writing is fantastic and their deliveries of the lines (native Japanese voices) are superb. The world they live in is also fun and interesting, and you end up feeling like you have learned something at least a little applicable to our own world. The animation is well done and I feel that Spice and Wolf holds a special place in my heart. Normally I don't like slow anime that is mostly talk and banter, I usually enjoy shows more like Darker than Black and Code Geass. But Spice and Wolf just put everything together well, and it made me actually like the two main characters a lot.
