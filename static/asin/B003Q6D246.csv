1357175,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B003Q6D246,Armando N. Roman,"[1, 1]","The first [REC] caught me by surprise because of how perfectly paced and shot it was for being a found footage movie, and a horror one at that. It did everything right- had characters you wanted to be safe, just the right amount of gore, a genuinely scary situation, and it didn't have any boring scenes. It's one of the few horror movies I can watch every couple of months and still have fun watching it. A sequel wasn't necessary, but when I heard one was being made, I couldn't wait to see it. Well, I watched it about a month ago, and everything's surprisingly still fresh in my mind, but it took me this long to have a final verdict on it. The movie started out great, then came to a sudden halt about halfway through, and then some new plot devices took me out of everything at the end. It wasn't bad, and I did like what they did with the twist, but I felt like it didn't belong in this movie.[REC] 2 starts up with some officers getting ready to take action, looking for survivors in the apartment building where several people were locked in due to an infection. It's quickly revealed that they're not really looking for survivors when the leader of the operation turns out to be with the Vatican, and he wants to get a blood sample to find out the truth about the infection. As we learned in the first movie, a young girl seemed to be possessed and was locked in the attic of the apartment where another holy person was conducting experiments on her. The squadron make their way through the building, finding the blood sample they need, and sure enough, it ain't normal blood. It reacts to holy elements, as do the infected people when the priest recites passages from the Bible. Unfortunately, the sample is destroyed within minutes and they realize they need to get the blood from the possessed girl. It's easier said than done, what with tons of infected people still running around in the building. At the same time, a group of kids and the father of the infected girl from the first movie make it into the building. How are they going to fare without any conventional weapons?It's hard to say much about the movie's plot without revealing too much. Where the first [REC] played the infection out like a zombie movie (I don't care if they're not ""technically"" zombies, that's what they pretty much are), this one takes the demon route. As much as I liked the aspect of Biblical passages and crosses putting these guys in their place, it felt like this should've been an entirely different movie. By the end of it, I was a bit let down not only with the eye-roll-inducing final moment, but that it seemed like they -had- to make a sequel and threw in a bunch of new stuff because they couldn't think of anything more original. Things go so into the paranormal at the end, that I said ""what?"" out loud since it seemed happened so abruptly. They also made this movie consist of two stories...well, they tried to anyway. The footage with the priest and his men stops for a brief time, and we cut over to some teenagers who are doing crazy kid stuff outside of the apartment when they notice everything going on. They want to check it out, and get trapped in the building with everyone else. Their footage isn't that interesting, though it has a great moment with some fireworks later on, and it hurts the momentum of the movie. The kids could've been completely removed from the movie and I would've been find with that. My last main complaint is that the subtitles on the dvd release aren't too accurate during some scenes. Supposedly, the blu-ray release has better subtitles, but I can't confirm this myself.Fortunately, the camera work here is still done by the same guy who did the first movie's, and everything is shot perfectly. You feel like you're right there with the officers trying to make it out of hell alive. The acting by each and every person is solid, even those darn meddlin' kids who come off as darn meddlin' kids. I was surprised by how much I liked the characters here, from the seemingly uppity priest who turns out to be a no-nonsense kinda guy, to the more talkative/longer lasting soldiers that shouldn't have been thrown into something like this without any kind of briefing. For what it's worth, there's a very brutal kill early on in the movie that trumps anything else that happens as it progresses, and anything else in the first [REC] for that matter.While the movie didn't win me over like the first one did, and I may have a lot of problems with it, it's still not a bad movie. Fans of the first one are sure to at least like it, and people looking for a decent horror movie could do much, much worse than [REC] 2. Here's hoping that the next [REC] (not the god-awful third one) brings the series back on track.",3,More Of The Same: The Movie.,1341187200,"07 2, 2012",2012,4756,"['first', '[', 'REC', ']', 'caught', 'surprise', 'how', 'perfectly', 'paced', 'shot', 'was', 'being', 'found', 'footage', 'movie', 'horror', 'one', 'did', 'everything', 'right-', 'had', 'characters', 'wanted', 'be', 'safe', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'gore', 'genuinely', 'scary', 'situation', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'boring', 'scenes', 'one', 'few', 'horror', 'movies', 'can', 'watch', 'couple', 'months', 'still', 'have', 'fun', 'watching', 'sequel', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'when', 'heard', 'one', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'Well', 'watched', 'month', 'ago', 'everything', 'surprisingly', 'still', 'fresh', 'mind', 'took', 'long', 'have', 'final', 'verdict', 'movie', 'started', 'out', 'great', 'then', 'came', 'sudden', 'halt', 'halfway', 'then', 'new', 'plot', 'devices', 'took', 'everything', 'end', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'did', 'like', 'what', 'did', 'twist', 'felt', 'did', ""n't"", 'belong', 'movie', 'REC', ']', '2', 'up', 'officers', 'getting', 'ready', 'take', 'action', 'looking', 'survivors', 'apartment', 'building', 'where', 'several', 'people', 'were', 'locked', 'due', 'infection', 'quickly', 'revealed', ""'re"", 'not', 'really', 'looking', 'survivors', 'when', 'leader', 'operation', 'out', 'be', 'Vatican', 'get', 'blood', 'sample', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'infection', 'learned', 'first', 'movie', 'young', 'girl', 'seemed', 'be', 'possessed', 'was', 'locked', 'attic', 'apartment', 'where', 'holy', 'person', 'was', 'conducting', 'experiments', 'squadron', 'make', 'way', 'building', 'finding', 'blood', 'sample', 'need', 'sure', 'enough', 'ai', ""n't"", 'normal', 'blood', 'holy', 'elements', 'do', 'infected', 'people', 'when', 'priest', 'passages', 'Bible', 'Unfortunately', 'sample', 'destroyed', 'minutes', 'realize', 'need', 'get', 'blood', 'possessed', 'girl', 'easier', 'said', 'done', 'what', 'tons', 'infected', 'people', 'still', 'running', 'around', 'building', 'same', 'time', 'group', 'kids', 'father', 'infected', 'girl', 'first', 'movie', 'make', 'building', 'How', 'are', 'going', 'fare', 'conventional', 'weapons', 'hard', 'say', 'much', 'movie', 'plot', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', 'Where', 'first', '[', 'REC', ']', 'played', 'infection', 'zombie', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', ""'re"", 'not', 'technically', 'zombies', 'what', 'pretty', 'much', 'are', 'one', 'demon', 'route', 'As', 'much', 'liked', 'aspect', 'Biblical', 'passages', 'crosses', 'putting', 'guys', 'place', 'felt', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'entirely', 'different', 'movie', 'end', 'was', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'not', 'only', 'eye-roll-inducing', 'final', 'moment', 'seemed', '-had-', 'make', 'sequel', 'threw', 'bunch', 'new', 'stuff', 'could', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'more', 'original', 'Things', 'go', 'so', 'paranormal', 'end', 'said', 'what', 'loud', 'seemed', 'happened', 'so', 'abruptly', 'also', 'made', 'movie', 'consist', 'two', 'stories', 'well', 'tried', 'anyway', 'footage', 'priest', 'men', 'stops', 'brief', 'time', 'cut', 'over', 'teenagers', 'who', 'are', 'doing', 'crazy', 'kid', 'stuff', 'apartment', 'when', 'notice', 'everything', 'going', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'get', 'trapped', 'building', 'everyone', 'else', 'footage', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'great', 'moment', 'fireworks', 'later', 'momentum', 'movie', 'kids', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'completely', 'removed', 'movie', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'find', 'last', 'main', 'complaint', 'subtitles', 'dvd', 'release', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'accurate', 'scenes', 'Supposedly', 'blu-ray', 'release', 'better', 'subtitles', 'ca', ""n't"", 'confirm', 'myself.Fortunately', 'camera', 'work', 'here', 'still', 'done', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'did', 'first', 'movie', 'everything', 'shot', 'perfectly', 'feel', ""'re"", 'right', 'there', 'officers', 'trying', 'make', 'hell', 'alive', 'acting', 'person', 'solid', 'even', 'darn', 'meddlin', 'kids', 'who', 'come', 'off', 'darn', 'meddlin', 'kids', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'characters', 'here', 'seemingly', 'uppity', 'priest', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'no-nonsense', 'kinda', 'guy', 'more', 'talkative/longer', 'lasting', 'soldiers', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'thrown', 'something', 'kind', 'briefing', 'what', 'worth', 'very', 'brutal', 'kill', 'early', 'movie', 'anything', 'else', 'anything', 'else', 'first', '[', 'REC', ']', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'first', 'one', 'did', 'may', 'have', 'lot', 'problems', 'still', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'Fans', 'first', 'one', 'are', 'sure', 'least', 'people', 'looking', 'decent', 'horror', 'movie', 'could', 'do', 'much', 'much', 'worse', '[', 'REC', ']', '2', 'Here', 'hoping', 'next', '[', 'REC', ']', 'not', 'god-awful', 'third', 'one', 'series', 'back', 'track']",N/A

1357181,A18D0R137EYS6C,B003Q6D246,Clinton Enlow,"[0, 0]","I'm probably being a bit too nice to REC 2 I think. Personally I loved the original film that was intense, dark, violent and well made. It had what a horror film needs in my opinion offering something that was compulsively watchable and actually had jump moments that worked. That was taken by Quarantine and added a layer of cheese that these FPS movies like to have with a bunch of moments where the actors break down in tears and bad acting. It also tried to explain the mysterious plague turning humans into rabid zombies in a way.And now comes REC 2 offering its own explanation in the first hour, a disappointing one at that. Offering an explanation kind of kills the experience in a way for me especially when it spoils the idea of the zombies and whats behind the infection in the apartment building. It takes that intensity that made the original good and squanders it on a bad idea.Thankfully unlike another disappointment in The Descent II the original directors are thankfully still at the helm and do make the film watchable from the opening moments  obviously echoing  the marines in Aliens (and of course FPS videogames). Bringing back a character from the original isn't as insulting as it was in the Descent sequel. And there are moments that make up for the lack of the originals final twenty minutes which to me were amazing (a characters final moments surrounded by possessed while in a bathroom being a highlight).The film is problematic but made good enough that its at least watchable in my opinion.",3,REC 2,1280275200,"07 28, 2010",2010,1522,"[""'m"", 'probably', 'being', 'bit', 'too', 'nice', 'REC', '2', 'think', 'Personally', 'loved', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'intense', 'dark', 'violent', 'well', 'made', 'had', 'what', 'horror', 'film', 'needs', 'opinion', 'offering', 'something', 'was', 'compulsively', 'watchable', 'actually', 'had', 'jump', 'moments', 'worked', 'was', 'taken', 'Quarantine', 'added', 'layer', 'cheese', 'FPS', 'movies', 'have', 'bunch', 'moments', 'where', 'actors', 'break', 'down', 'tears', 'bad', 'acting', 'also', 'tried', 'explain', 'mysterious', 'plague', 'turning', 'humans', 'rabid', 'zombies', 'way.And', 'now', 'REC', '2', 'offering', 'own', 'explanation', 'first', 'hour', 'disappointing', 'one', 'Offering', 'explanation', 'kind', 'kills', 'experience', 'way', 'especially', 'when', 'idea', 'zombies', 'whats', 'infection', 'apartment', 'building', 'intensity', 'made', 'original', 'good', 'squanders', 'bad', 'idea.Thankfully', 'disappointment', 'Descent', 'II', 'original', 'directors', 'are', 'thankfully', 'still', 'helm', 'do', 'make', 'film', 'watchable', 'opening', 'moments', 'obviously', 'echoing', 'marines', 'Aliens', 'course', 'FPS', 'videogames', 'Bringing', 'back', 'character', 'original', ""n't"", 'as', 'insulting', 'was', 'Descent', 'sequel', 'are', 'moments', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'originals', 'final', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'were', 'amazing', 'characters', 'final', 'moments', 'surrounded', 'possessed', 'while', 'bathroom', 'being', 'highlight', '.The', 'film', 'problematic', 'made', 'good', 'enough', 'least', 'watchable', 'opinion']",N/A
1357182,A24CLTMHT2KJL7,B003Q6D246,Daimonion,"[7, 7]","Generally I try to avoid sequels now, as they are for the most part ripoffs. Lazy cash-grabs. As for remakes, well, there isn't a good reason to see one unless the filmmaker's do something different with the material or add to it and make it more interesting in some way. But, of course they don't most times. Also it matters which film is being remade! In other words, I don't like sequels and I don't like remakes.There are always exceptions to everything, however, and [REC]2 is an example of a sequel that I enjoyed thoroughly. It manages to be non-stop action but without skimping on story at all. There is plenty of eerie atmosphere and a few jump scares. As a sequel should do, it gives us information about what happened to characters that survived the original and also furthered the story, filling in some of the mystery around the first story.In [REC]2, we follow a group of SWAT team members as they are sent into a quarantined apartment building where a viral outbreak has spread and killed most, turning residents into crazed, violent lunatics. The virus is described as a derivation of rabies. That's about all you should know about the plot going in. I don't want to ruin it for you. Let me say, though, that there are some surprises regarding the virus and it's origins as well as some of the people trying to get in and out of the building and their motives. However, this film does not hinge on plot twists, which is refreshing.The style in which this film was shot is terrific. It's done in much the same way as the first, only BETTER, as they improved their techniques. It's easier to watch, with less shaky, jerking camera and there's more light so you can tell what's happening easier. These things make it scarier and more intense. Also, there are more cameras, as the SWAT members have helmet cams, giving us more points of view, so the film is interesting in that way. Several scenes reminded me of Aliens, as we get to see through each team member's helmet cam with their last name in the upper corner. It's a terrific idea and makes for some high tension moments.This is an intense film with good acting and well-done effects.

1357185,A3IA3ABAT5WM5R,B003Q6D246,"D. Feaster ""Mediaphile""","[0, 1]","This DVD, REC 2, is an import DVD from Singapore.  I live in the US and it played on my XBox 360 without any problems.  The subtitles are in English or Japanese.If you don't want to read some spoilers, stop here.In the first film, the reason for the infection that transformed innocent apartment dwellers into rampaging, bloodthirsty maniacs remained hidden until the end of the film.  If you've seen the first film, then you know that the infection in the REC films is a plague of contagious demonic possession.  In that respect, these films tread similar ground with Lamberto Bava's Demons and perhaps even Kevin Tenney's Night of the Demons.  All of these films are about people trapped in a building where others are being possessed by demons who then try to kill all others or infect them with possession as well.  Possession in the REC films, though, is treated more traditionally than in Demons or Night of the Demons.  More akin, to say, The Exorcist.What distinguishes the REC films from films like Demons and Night of the Demons is a matter of perspective: the action is being viewed through cameras belonging to characters in the film, or in other words, the film presents itself as ""found footage"", just as in films like the Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield.  One difference between REC and REC2 is that there are more characters with cameras in REC 2.  REC was filmed almost exclusively from the perspective of the TV news show cameraman, Pablo.  In REC 2, we have a four man SWAT team each with a helmet cam in addition to two other cameras, including the original camera from REC, coming into the movie later.  Thus REC 2 is filmed by more characters, allowing for different perspectives on the action.REC 2 starts shortly after the events in REC.  A four man SWAT team escorts an investigator into the apartment building from the first film, however, the investgator is not what he appears to be.  The investigator is searching for an item necessary to create a vaccine to cure the infection.  Unfortunately, things just keep going from bad to worse.  The investigator and the survivors of the SWAT team are eventually joined by a fireman, a man looking for his wife and daughter, and three curious teenagers who happen to have a video camera with them.  The survivors of this group are finally joined by one other unexpected survivor.  The ending for me was a little predictable, given the circimstances, but nonetheless, I found REC 2 to be even more enjoyable than the original.If you saw the first film and liked it, you definitely want to see this one as it is an entertaining continuation of the original film, expanding upon its mythos.One other difference between REC and REC 2, is that you have some extremely well armed characters in REC 2.  It doesn't help them that much.",4,Great Sequel,1298246400,"02 21, 2011",2011,2802,"['DVD', 'REC', '2', 'import', 'DVD', 'Singapore', 'live', 'US', 'played', 'XBox', '360', 'problems', 'subtitles', 'are', 'English', 'Japanese.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'read', 'spoilers', 'stop', 'here.In', 'first', 'film', 'reason', 'infection', 'transformed', 'innocent', 'apartment', 'dwellers', 'rampaging', 'bloodthirsty', 'maniacs', 'remained', 'hidden', 'end', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'first', 'film', 'then', 'know', 'infection', 'REC', 'films', 'plague', 'contagious', 'demonic', 'possession', 'respect', 'films', 'tread', 'similar', 'ground', 'Lamberto', 'Bava', 'Demons', 'perhaps', 'even', 'Kevin', 'Tenney', 'Night', 'Demons', 'films', 'are', 'people', 'trapped', 'building', 'where', 'others', 'are', 'being', 'possessed', 'demons', 'who', 'then', 'try', 'kill', 'others', 'infect', 'possession', 'as', 'well', 'Possession', 'REC', 'films', 'treated', 'more', 'traditionally', 'Demons', 'Night', 'Demons', 'More', 'akin', 'say', 'Exorcist.What', 'REC', 'films', 'films', 'Demons', 'Night', 'Demons', 'matter', 'perspective', 'action', 'being', 'viewed', 'cameras', 'belonging', 'characters', 'film', 'other', 'words', 'film', 'found', 'footage', 'just', 'films', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'Cloverfield', 'One', 'difference', 'REC', 'REC2', 'are', 'more', 'characters', 'cameras', 'REC', '2', 'REC', 'was', 'filmed', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'perspective', 'TV', 'news', 'show', 'cameraman', 'Pablo', 'REC', '2', 'have', 'four', 'man', 'SWAT', 'helmet', 'cam', 'addition', 'two', 'other', 'cameras', 'including', 'original', 'camera', 'REC', 'coming', 'movie', 'later', 'Thus', 'REC', '2', 'filmed', 'more', 'characters', 'allowing', 'different', 'perspectives', 'action.REC', '2', 'starts', 'shortly', 'events', 'REC', 'four', 'man', 'SWAT', 'team', 'investigator', 'apartment', 'building', 'first', 'film', 'however', 'investgator', 'not', 'what', 'be', 'investigator', 'searching', 'item', 'necessary', 'create', 'vaccine', 'cure', 'infection', 'Unfortunately', 'things', 'just', 'keep', 'going', 'bad', 'worse', 'investigator', 'survivors', 'SWAT', 'team', 'are', 'eventually', 'joined', 'fireman', 'man', 'looking', 'wife', 'daughter', 'three', 'curious', 'teenagers', 'who', 'happen', 'have', 'video', 'camera', 'survivors', 'group', 'are', 'finally', 'joined', 'one', 'other', 'unexpected', 'survivor', 'ending', 'was', 'little', 'predictable', 'given', 'circimstances', 'nonetheless', 'found', 'REC', '2', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'original.If', 'saw', 'first', 'film', 'liked', 'definitely', 'want', 'see', 'one', 'entertaining', 'continuation', 'original', 'film', 'expanding', 'mythos.One', 'other', 'difference', 'REC', 'REC', '2', 'have', 'extremely', 'well', 'armed', 'characters', 'REC', '2', ""n't"", 'help', 'that', 'much']",N/A

1357189,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B003Q6D246,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 1]","This is a bit different from the first in that the writer/producer/director infuse a back story to the proceedings that aims for a resolution. The first installment is much like Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" in that the situation just explodes with no real explanation as to how it started (until the final scene). The audience is experiencing the events at the same time as those involved. That, with the fact you have a reporter there recording the events, is what gave the original it's power and sense of immediacy.This installment (it looks like they're bucking for a third) begins right where the first left off. The building is still sealed off and a SWAT team has to escort a doctor in so he can get the scoop on what happened. Of course it isn't that easy and there are surprises for all. Part of that lies in the fact some teenagers have made their way into the building to see what's happening and they complicate issues. They also have a vid-cam to record what they're seeing.This was good but, for my money, there were some mistakes made that kept it from being really great. This will be difficult to explain without spoiling so bare with me. Given the new plot line there is something that happens in the first 15 minutes that shouldn't have happened until late in the 2nd or early 3rd act. And it could easily have been done without screwing anything up. To me it threw the story and rhythm way out of whack. Also, introducing the teenagers was actually a decent touch but to keep the whole 'first person recording thing' going they had to give them a camera as well. To me they could have mixed traditional filming techniques with the first person thing and still held it's sense of immediacy. It would not have been unlike Cameron's ""Aliens.""Don't get me wrong. This is still a fun ride with a lot of thrills. Everyone does a fine job and there are some truly unsettling images, particularly near the end. They also make great use of the location. The building has a personality all its own and they do good job of exploiting it. A little nip here and a tuck there would have made this, not only better than the original, but really good movie in its own right.",3,Good Sequal But Not Great,1313452800,"08 16, 2011",2011,2185,"['bit', 'different', 'first', 'writer/producer/director', 'infuse', 'back', 'story', 'proceedings', 'resolution', 'first', 'installment', 'much', 'Romero', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'situation', 'just', 'real', 'explanation', 'how', 'started', 'final', 'scene', 'audience', 'experiencing', 'events', 'same', 'time', 'involved', 'fact', 'have', 'reporter', 'there', 'recording', 'events', 'what', 'gave', 'original', 'power', 'sense', 'immediacy.This', 'installment', ""'re"", 'bucking', 'third', 'right', 'where', 'first', 'left', 'off', 'building', 'still', 'sealed', 'off', 'SWAT', 'team', 'escort', 'doctor', 'can', 'get', 'scoop', 'what', 'happened', 'course', ""n't"", 'easy', 'are', 'surprises', 'Part', 'fact', 'teenagers', 'have', 'made', 'way', 'building', 'see', 'what', 'happening', 'complicate', 'issues', 'also', 'have', 'vid-cam', 'record', 'what', ""'re"", 'seeing.This', 'was', 'good', 'money', 'were', 'mistakes', 'made', 'kept', 'being', 'really', 'great', 'will', 'be', 'difficult', 'explain', 'spoiling', 'so', 'bare', 'Given', 'new', 'plot', 'line', 'something', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'happened', 'late', '2nd', 'early', '3rd', 'act', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'screwing', 'anything', 'up', 'threw', 'story', 'rhythm', 'way', 'whack', 'Also', 'introducing', 'teenagers', 'was', 'actually', 'decent', 'touch', 'keep', 'whole', 'person', 'recording', 'thing', 'going', 'had', 'give', 'camera', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'mixed', 'traditional', 'filming', 'techniques', 'first', 'person', 'thing', 'still', 'held', 'sense', 'immediacy', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'Cameron', 'Aliens', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'still', 'fun', 'ride', 'lot', 'thrills', 'Everyone', 'fine', 'job', 'are', 'truly', 'unsettling', 'images', 'particularly', 'end', 'also', 'make', 'great', 'use', 'location', 'building', 'personality', 'own', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'exploiting', 'little', 'nip', 'here', 'tuck', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'not', 'only', 'better', 'original', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'own', 'right']",N/A

1357192,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B003Q6D246,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 1]","Cloverfield,Chronicle, and[Rec] happen to be my top three favorite found footage films, but, of them three, only the Spanish zombie horror picture [REC] saw fit to grace its fans with a sequel (with a second sequel already out and a third one underway). [REC] was an experimental frightener concerning a mysterious outbreak in a residential building in Barcelona. It scared the bejesus out of me.[REC] 2 picks up mere minutes after the harrowing events of the original movie. This time, a S.W.A.T. team escorts a medical official from the Ministry of Health into the sealed structure. A S.W.A.T. member, armed with a video camera, is tasked with officially documenting the mission. As in the first film, ""We must record everything."" is the strident battle cry. The cameraman's equipment even has a picture-in-picture function which is married to corresponding cameras fixed on the gear of the other squad members, thus allowing us the occasional shift in perspective. That is, if you care for frenzied scamperings inside cramped air vents whilst the marauding undead descend on some panicked law enforcer bastard.[REC] 2 veers away from tying the origin of the zombie outbreak to some scientific snafu. But, no worries, man's hubris still plays a role in raising the revenant. It turns out that the medic isn't a medic at all, but a disguised priest (Jonathan Mellor). He informs the skeptical S.W.A.T. team that the unholy infestation is manifested from a supernatural source. Their real mission is to unearth a cure in case containment becomes compromised. To do this, they must procure a blood sample from the original zombie girl (she with the bloody wicked mallet and the unbecoming undies).And because this sequel isn't immune to cliches, the film, roughly around 30 minutes into it, breaks away from this first cast of characters to introduce a new set of zombie fodder. And, yes, they're a bunch of dumb teenagers who somehow manage to sneak into the sealed-off building. And, yes, one of these kids has a video camera. Gauging their level of foolhardiness - really, why would you venture into a building that's been cordoned off because of a highly virulent contagion? - well, I couldn't wait for them to get what's coming to them. I even yearned for their deaths to be exceedingly gross and painful.For those who've seen the first [REC], there's a neat element in that the zombies in this sequel are comprised of characters who were turned in the original film, so there's a bit of ""Hey, I remember that guy!"" going on. [REC] 2 plays up that claustrophobic vibe even more. I quite relished the plot device which compels the priest's unsettling remark: ""The night vision will reveal hidden things, things we didn't see."" As if it weren't terrifying enough, now, for our characters to locate their patient zero, they have to turn out the light. But nasty things happen when the lights are out.[REC] 2, made on a bigger budget, captures the grimy, chilling, spellbinding essence of its predecessor. You want visceral scares? You crave unrelenting suspense? You're in the right wrong place. As in the first film, there are moments so fraught with nail-biting terror I had to fight off the urge to look away. Jonathan Mellor as the priest with the hard agenda exudes a commanding presence. When he utters grandiose statements like ""He gives me the power to walk over snakes, and vanquish my enemies."" - he has such conviction you want to believe he has a fighting chance. Fans of the first [REC] will be gratified to see the lovely Manuela Velasco reprise her reporter role late in the narrative. But, like me, you'll be uneasy and wondering just how she managed to survive getting dragged into the darkness. She demonstrates a more physical toughness... But she's been thru a lot in that house of horrors, so you can see her being that much more aggressive and paranoid.The cherry on top is that [REC] 2, every now and then, ambushes you with unexpected humor. Black humor, mind you. I couldn't curb them giggles when the film demonstrated how effectively a rocket can be employed to get an attacking zombie off someone's back. Moments later, the giggles turned to mewling cries of fright. This [REC] franchise is fast turning me into a world class wimp.The DVD's bonus stuff (with English sub-titles):- 4 Deleted & Extended Scenes (00:06:48 minutes)- Extensive Behind the Scenes featurette

This of course does not affect the quality of the movie neither will the fact that it was filmed in spanish. You do have subtitles, but since I know spanish this was not a problem for me. It picks up where the first one left off, we are talking within minutes. The gore and blood is plenty and abundant. Now the people alledgedly turn into zombies but as we find out they are much more complicated than a zombie, I would explain that but that would be a spoiler alert for those of you who have not seen it. The plot becomes interesting as we learn more about the evolution of these demons. The characters here are very naive at times as they do not know what they are dealing with. In general you don't have one single character that knows it all or  YOU DO NOT have a hero that saves the day but you do have a group of people working together to get out of the depths of hell that seems to be surrounding them at times. You don't have characters that try and be funny or brave which makes this movie very real and scary at times. May I also add this: you see children zombies that are more terrifying then adult zombies. The end is very unexpected and surreal almost supernatural making it borderline between the biblical and the theological.  If you saw the first one and was disapointed with the many plot holes, this sequel will certainly fill in those holes.

1357195,A1Y0HX12MCT6OR,B003Q6D246,I'm Right,"[0, 1]","SpoilersSo after the events of the previous film [REC] 2 picks up minutes afterwards, where a rather small SWAT team moves in lead by a priest. At this point you can indicate that the sequel isn't going the zombie route the first one did, and while it twisted the idea and gave the sequel new material to work with it just didn't feel very consistent for me. In this one the demons can talk and crawl on walls and such, if the first one gave ANY hint of this than I'd be ok with it but it doesn't so we kind of get this twist leftfield. Still [REC] 2 is a solid horror movie that doesn't disappoint on the thrills and chills.The film can be divided up into 3 acts, the first act features the team moving in and checking out the building, encountering the infec-demons, sorry, and learning the severity of their predicament. The second act shows three teenagers with a camera sneak into the building to see what all the hullabaloo is about and run into the SWAT guys. Then the final act is, well you'll just have to find out, there is a great twist in the final act. Of all these acts I found the second act to be the weakest,  it's pretty jarring and weird from being with the SWAT team to suddenly see a bunch of teenagers bickering. I can see why they did it though, to add a new element and such, but when one of the kids gets possessed they literally lock the other two in a room and just forget about them for the rest of the movie, we never see them again. They could've pulled this off better, I don't know how I'm not a screenwriter but I'm sure there's a way to make it work.The first half is pretty good, it almost feels like a videogame but they add a few human elements to make it better than that 2005 turd DOOM, and you get to see the whole cast from the first movie in all their *possessed* glory and you get some intense scenes where the team is pushed to their limits. The third act things get really creepy with some surrealism that I didn't mind unlike other amazon reviewers. If they're going to take a new angle on [REC] they might as well go all the way with it which they wisely did.All of the actors were great, considering what they had to work with. My personal favorite being the priest, who was way more of a badass than that schmoe who was in the movie titled ""Priest"". [REC] 2 also had some gruesome and interesting deaths, the strangest one was shamelessly ripped off by Grave Encounters. The zombies (or demons, whatever) are as gruesome looking as ever, all of it is really good. It's just that [REC] 2 overshot it's potential, what made the first one so effective was it's simplicity. But who can really blame a movie for going above and beyond? [REC] 2 is still a blast, it just didn't have very good continuity with the first one.",4,[REC] goes Aliens on us,1333324800,"04 2, 2012",2012,2766,"['SpoilersSo', 'events', 'previous', 'film', '[', 'REC', ']', '2', 'picks', 'up', 'minutes', 'afterwards', 'where', 'rather', 'small', 'SWAT', 'team', 'moves', 'lead', 'priest', 'point', 'can', 'indicate', 'sequel', ""n't"", 'going', 'zombie', 'route', 'first', 'one', 'did', 'twisted', 'idea', 'gave', 'sequel', 'new', 'material', 'work', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'very', 'consistent', 'one', 'demons', 'can', 'talk', 'crawl', 'walls', 'such', 'first', 'one', 'gave', 'ANY', 'hint', ""'d"", 'be', 'ok', ""n't"", 'so', 'kind', 'get', 'twist', 'leftfield', 'Still', '[', 'REC', ']', '2', 'solid', 'horror', 'movie', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'thrills', 'chills.The', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'divided', 'up', '3', 'acts', 'first', 'act', 'team', 'moving', 'checking', 'out', 'building', 'encountering', 'infec-demons', 'sorry', 'learning', 'severity', 'predicament', 'second', 'act', 'shows', 'three', 'teenagers', 'camera', 'sneak', 'building', 'see', 'what', 'hullabaloo', 'about', 'run', 'SWAT', 'guys', 'Then', 'final', 'act', 'well', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'find', 'out', 'great', 'twist', 'final', 'act', 'acts', 'found', 'second', 'act', 'be', 'weakest', 'pretty', 'jarring', 'weird', 'being', 'SWAT', 'team', 'suddenly', 'see', 'bunch', 'teenagers', 'bickering', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'did', 'add', 'new', 'element', 'such', 'when', 'one', 'kids', 'possessed', 'literally', 'lock', 'other', 'two', 'room', 'just', 'forget', 'rest', 'movie', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'could', ""'ve"", 'pulled', 'off', 'better', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', ""'m"", 'not', 'screenwriter', ""'m"", 'sure', 'way', 'make', 'work.The', 'first', 'half', 'pretty', 'good', 'almost', 'feels', 'videogame', 'add', 'few', 'human', 'elements', 'make', 'better', '2005', 'turd', 'DOOM', 'get', 'see', 'whole', 'cast', 'first', 'movie', '*possessed*', 'glory', 'get', 'intense', 'scenes', 'where', 'team', 'pushed', 'limits', 'third', 'act', 'things', 'get', 'really', 'creepy', 'surrealism', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'other', 'amazon', 'reviewers', ""'re"", 'going', 'take', 'new', 'angle', '[', 'REC', ']', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'go', 'way', 'wisely', 'did.All', 'actors', 'were', 'great', 'considering', 'what', 'had', 'work', 'personal', 'favorite', 'being', 'priest', 'who', 'was', 'way', 'more', 'badass', 'schmoe', 'who', 'was', 'movie', 'titled', 'Priest', '[', 'REC', ']', '2', 'also', 'had', 'gruesome', 'interesting', 'deaths', 'strangest', 'one', 'was', 'shamelessly', 'ripped', 'off', 'Grave', 'Encounters', 'zombies', 'demons', 'are', 'gruesome', 'looking', 'ever', 'really', 'good', 'just', 'REC', ']', '2', 'potential', 'what', 'made', 'first', 'one', 'so', 'effective', 'was', 'simplicity', 'who', 'can', 'really', 'blame', 'movie', 'going', '[', 'REC', ']', '2', 'still', 'blast', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'very', 'good', 'continuity', 'first', 'one']",N/A

We get plenty of scares and the action is turned up. While the first film focused more on running and hiding, this film gives us more of a first-person shooter perspective. It's still very thrilling and moves at a very fast pace, but it's not as scary or creepy as the first film. The acting was great and should be watched in Spanish, the panic in their voices is still effective and realistic; like I mentioned in my review of the first movie, I doubt a dub/voiceover can capture the same emotion as the Spanish cast. I had mixed feelings about the ending; I liked it, but it wasn't spectacular. And, although it feels a little different from the first, it's not as innovative as the original film was when it released.Overall, I highly recommend purchasing or at least watching [Rec] 2.

Following a group of firefighters on a seemingly routine call, the rescue workers, the cameraman, and the reporter are inadvertently trapped in an apartment building where the residents appear to be succumbing to a strange, vicious disease that -- with one bite -- turns them into bloodthirsty monsters. Intense, cleverly filmed, and claustrophobic (the building is quickly quarantined), the film was a step up for horror films, this in spite of (or maybe even because of) its use of the ever more tiresome ""found footage"" trope.This film follows immediately where the last one left off. In this case, our found footage comes from a trained group of SWAT members who enter the building with a mysterious doctor to ascertain the source of the infection. Halfway through the film, there is a leap back in time as we watch -- again through found footage -- as a group of teens manages to infiltrate the building. What follows is a merging of perspectives and experiences, as each group struggles to survive among the building's ravenous denizens.Although the story follows perfectly from the previous film, and although it satisfactorily answers some niggling questions about the rather inconsistent behavior of those who are ""infected,"" and although the conclusion of the film is clever but also deft enough not to lose its tension, I found myself disliking this film from the first ten minutes.The dialogue is repetitive and uninspired, and the SWAT men have got to be some of the most incompetent and cliched characters I've seen in a long time. So the audience might be treated to literally a dozen shots of creatures leaping at the screen, the SWAT men rarely fire their weapons, spending most of their time screaming like little girls at every little thing and then yelling ""What's going on?"" and ""What is that?"" over and over and over again. Instead of rooting for our human characters, I found myself begging the monsters to take out most of the men, the loudest of whom displayed the kind of fortitude and skill that is more often found in paranoid schizophrenics as opposed to supposedly highly trained operatives.The kids aren't any better. Their reasons for getting into the building -- as well as how they manage it -- strain credulity. Even with a hefty suspension of disbelief, they are annoying to the point of distraction. Once again, I found myself praying that they would be dispatched of quickly, although -- yet again -- we were treated to more quick, skittering shots of critters leaping at the lens of the cameraman who -- although a teen -- manages to have the wherewithal to keep filming.There are moments of tension and intrigue, some nice twists and scenes, but these things are so buffeted by lunacy (why would a priest keep a refrigerator of blood THERE?) and annoying/unbelievable characters that the movie becomes a trial to watch.",2,"SWAT Men Who Act Like Teens, and Teens Who Act Like SWAT Men",1345161600,"08 17, 2012",2012,2990,"['original', 'REC', 'followed', 'hapless', 'reporter', 'attempted', 'do', 'report', 'series', 'people', 'high', 'octane', 'jobs', 'Following', 'group', 'firefighters', 'seemingly', 'routine', 'call', 'rescue', 'workers', 'cameraman', 'reporter', 'are', 'inadvertently', 'trapped', 'apartment', 'building', 'where', 'residents', 'appear', 'be', 'succumbing', 'strange', 'vicious', 'disease', 'one', 'bite', 'bloodthirsty', 'monsters', 'Intense', 'cleverly', 'filmed', 'claustrophobic', 'building', 'quickly', 'quarantined', 'film', 'was', 'step', 'up', 'horror', 'films', 'spite', 'maybe', 'even', 'use', 'ever', 'more', 'tiresome', 'found', 'footage', 'trope.This', 'film', 'immediately', 'where', 'last', 'one', 'left', 'off', 'case', 'found', 'footage', 'trained', 'group', 'SWAT', 'members', 'who', 'enter', 'building', 'mysterious', 'doctor', 'ascertain', 'source', 'infection', 'Halfway', 'film', 'leap', 'back', 'time', 'watch', 'again', 'found', 'footage', 'group', 'teens', 'manages', 'infiltrate', 'building', 'What', 'merging', 'perspectives', 'experiences', 'group', 'survive', 'building', 'ravenous', 'story', 'perfectly', 'previous', 'film', 'answers', 'niggling', 'questions', 'rather', 'inconsistent', 'behavior', 'who', 'are', 'infected', 'conclusion', 'film', 'clever', 'also', 'deft', 'enough', 'not', 'lose', 'tension', 'found', 'disliking', 'film', 'first', 'minutes.The', 'dialogue', 'repetitive', 'uninspired', 'SWAT', 'men', 'have', 'got', 'be', 'most', 'incompetent', 'cliched', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'audience', 'might', 'be', 'treated', 'literally', 'dozen', 'shots', 'creatures', 'leaping', 'screen', 'SWAT', 'men', 'rarely', 'fire', 'weapons', 'spending', 'most', 'time', 'screaming', 'like', 'little', 'girls', 'little', 'thing', 'then', 'yelling', 'What', 'going', 'What', 'over', 'again', 'Instead', 'rooting', 'human', 'characters', 'found', 'begging', 'monsters', 'take', 'out', 'most', 'men', 'loudest', 'whom', 'displayed', 'kind', 'fortitude', 'skill', 'more', 'often', 'found', 'paranoid', 'schizophrenics', 'opposed', 'supposedly', 'highly', 'trained', 'operatives.The', 'kids', 'are', ""n't"", 'better', 'reasons', 'getting', 'building', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'manage', 'strain', 'credulity', 'Even', 'hefty', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'are', 'annoying', 'point', 'distraction', 'Once', 'again', 'found', 'praying', 'would', 'be', 'dispatched', 'quickly', 'yet', 'again', 'were', 'treated', 'more', 'quick', 'skittering', 'shots', 'critters', 'leaping', 'lens', 'cameraman', 'who', 'teen', 'manages', 'have', 'wherewithal', 'keep', 'are', 'moments', 'tension', 'intrigue', 'nice', 'twists', 'scenes', 'things', 'are', 'so', 'buffeted', 'lunacy', 'why', 'would', 'priest', 'keep', 'refrigerator', 'blood', 'THERE', 'annoying/unbelievable', 'characters', 'movie', 'trial', 'watch']",N/A

Well I guess the international success of the equally low budget original is a good reason from a financial perspective.  From the viewer's perspective, why?  This has little new in terms of a story.  It just picks up where the last one left off.  The original from 2007 is one of the best horror films in the last decade.  I am a big fan.

One of the problems with watching a subtitled horror film is that dialogue becomes noticeably inane very quickly because you're forced to read rather than just hear it.

You'll have a regular camera then a small box in the corner which indicates the viewpoint of one of the helmet cameras worn by the SWAT team. It's really a distraction more than an enhancement. Also, including a small group of teens who sneak in and the father of the little girl from the first movie left me asking myself why they were in the movie at all. *SPOILER* The little girl's father from the first [rec] manages to get inside only to get bitten by his wife and shot by the surviving SWAT members and the priest, while one of the teens gets bit and the others are just locked in a room *SPOILER*.

Given the end of [REC], I didn't see how that was possible. I hadn't heard anything about it going in, and so finding out how they pulled that off was one of the pleasant surprises of the film. There is, however, no way I can really give you a plot synopsis without destroying that for you, so instead of one, I'll just have to say that, yes, things do continue. There were some questions in the first film, especially in the final fifteen minutes, that remained unanswered, and we get closer to those answers here. But the last film ended with us not actually realizing some of those questions still needed asked; that's pretty darn cool.Most of the original cast returns as zombies, and there are a few wonderful asides that reference the original movie (remember the mother whose husband had gone out to get medicine for her sick daughter? We meet him briefly, as an example). Yes, the characters sometimes act stupid, which seems to be the main criticism of the movie, but depending on how old you are, this should not come as a surprise; just about every movie ever made (at least in the fictional realm) hinges on one or more characters making one or more dumb decisions. This is not only true of low-budget horror movies. (Deliverance, anyone? The third act of The Deer Hunter? Sunset Blvd.? And that's the barest tip of the iceberg...) I don't think it's a reason to trash a whole movie (or, in at least one reviewer's estimation, ""the worst movie I've ever seen"" solely for this reason). It's not a deathless piece of film literature, and it's not meant to be; it's a fun, turn-your-brain-off action picture, and it gets the job done nicely.

I won't go into it much further to prevent spoilers, but suffice it to say that the script takes a supernatural turn (suggested by the end of [Rec]), which directors Balaguero and Plaza then use to tie the films together.  With [Rec] 3 slated for an August release and [Rec] 4 in development, there's obviously questions still to be answered, though I think the series could have ended here and still been satisfactory.  In other words, there's no cliff-hanger demanding answers or teasers like the ending of [Rec] left us with.[Rec] 2 returns us to the same claustrophobic settings of the first one, as well as resuming the shaky-cam style of the first.  I've read plenty of opinions about this style, and if you've hated it before, then you're not going to find anything here to change your mind.  To me, I don't mind these films per se, unless I feel as though we are getting too many cheap scares from the technique, like when the camera slowly pans around a room only to land on the boogey-man at the very end, who has waited until that moment to make his move.  That sort of stylistic technique gets overdone quickly, but if the cam is logically used instead, I think it can augment the tension nicely.  [Rec] 2, for the most part, does reasonably make use of the hand cams, with the nifty addition of the helmet cams of the SWAT team interspersed with the main recorder.  So, stylistically and technically, I think [Rec] 2 builds on the atmosphere created by [Rec], giving us more of the same with some twists.Story-wise, I'd say the movie is on shakier ground.  Both the revelations in the script, the actions of the teens who sneak into the building, and the sudden reappearance of one the characters from the first movie made it more difficult for me to suspend belief.  Part of this is an inherent problem when films are trying to 'puzzle' the audience.  In those cases, I'm spending more of my time trying to outguess the directors rather than letting myself be absorbed by events onscreen.  That, I think, was much of the charm of the first movie; it was more of simple scenario of survival than it was an explanation of events or a puzzle.That isn't to say I didn't like the film, because I did.  I just didn't think it was quite as good as the first.  Most horror film junkies will, I think, not be too terribly surprised at the 'surprise' ending, and though I figure they will also have a favorable impression of the film, I'd caution anyone from getting their expectations up.  That's another intrinsic problem for a film like this to hurdle; the first movie seems to come out of nowhere, and startle us with its freshness.  It also can't help but raise our expectations for the sequel.  In cases like these, I think it's best to know as little as possible about part 2, with the hope that it might sneak up on you like the first one did.  So stop reading reviews already and go watch.",4,Stop spoiling it by reading reviews and just go watch,1343260800,"07 26, 2012",2012,3151,"['[', 'Rec', ']', '2', 'action', 'up', 'right', 'point', 'where', 'first', 'installment', 'ended', 'entirely', 'new', 'set', 'characters', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'causes', 'contagion', 'threatened', 'cast', 'first', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'much', 'further', 'prevent', 'spoilers', 'say', 'script', 'supernatural', 'turn', 'suggested', 'end', '[', 'Rec', ']', 'directors', 'Balaguero', 'Plaza', 'then', 'use', 'tie', 'films', 'together', '[', 'Rec', ']', '3', 'slated', 'August', 'release', '[', 'Rec', ']', '4', 'development', 'obviously', 'questions', 'still', 'be', 'answered', 'think', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'here', 'still', 'been', 'satisfactory', 'other', 'words', 'cliff-hanger', 'demanding', 'answers', 'teasers', 'ending', '[', 'Rec', ']', 'left', '[', 'Rec', ']', '2', 'returns', 'same', 'claustrophobic', 'settings', 'first', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'resuming', 'shaky-cam', 'style', 'first', ""'ve"", 'read', 'plenty', 'opinions', 'style', ""'ve"", 'hated', 'then', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'find', 'anything', 'here', 'change', 'mind', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'films', 'se', 'feel', 'are', 'getting', 'too', 'many', 'cheap', 'scares', 'technique', 'when', 'camera', 'slowly', 'around', 'room', 'only', 'land', 'boogey-man', 'very', 'end', 'who', 'waited', 'moment', 'make', 'move', 'sort', 'stylistic', 'technique', 'overdone', 'quickly', 'cam', 'logically', 'used', 'instead', 'think', 'can', 'augment', 'tension', 'nicely', '[', 'Rec', ']', '2', 'most', 'part', 'reasonably', 'make', 'use', 'hand', 'cams', 'nifty', 'addition', 'helmet', 'cams', 'SWAT', 'team', 'interspersed', 'main', 'recorder', 'So', 'stylistically', 'technically', 'think', '[', 'Rec', ']', '2', 'builds', 'atmosphere', 'created', '[', 'Rec', ']', 'giving', 'more', 'same', 'twists.Story-wise', ""'d"", 'say', 'movie', 'shakier', 'ground', 'revelations', 'script', 'actions', 'teens', 'who', 'sneak', 'building', 'sudden', 'reappearance', 'one', 'characters', 'first', 'movie', 'made', 'more', 'difficult', 'suspend', 'belief', 'Part', 'inherent', 'problem', 'when', 'films', 'are', 'trying', ""'puzzle"", 'audience', 'cases', ""'m"", 'spending', 'more', 'time', 'trying', 'outguess', 'directors', 'rather', 'letting', 'be', 'absorbed', 'events', 'onscreen', 'think', 'was', 'much', 'charm', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'simple', 'scenario', 'survival', 'was', 'explanation', 'events', 'puzzle.That', ""n't"", 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'film', 'did', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'Most', 'horror', 'film', 'junkies', 'will', 'think', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'terribly', 'surprised', ""'surprise"", 'ending', 'figure', 'will', 'also', 'have', 'favorable', 'impression', 'film', ""'d"", 'caution', 'anyone', 'getting', 'expectations', 'up', 'intrinsic', 'problem', 'film', 'hurdle', 'first', 'movie', 'come', 'nowhere', 'startle', 'freshness', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'raise', 'expectations', 'sequel', 'cases', 'think', 'best', 'know', 'as', 'little', 'possible', 'part', '2', 'hope', 'might', 'sneak', 'up', 'first', 'one', 'did', 'So', 'stop', 'reading', 'reviews', 'already', 'go', 'watch']",N/A

Taking place fifteen minutes after the original, Dr. Owen (Mellor) goes into the apartment building to try and find a cure.  After searching for the original host of the disease he discovers something he didn't plan on.  Having not seen the first one (I did watch ""Quarantine"" though) I wasn't sure what to expect.  I do have to say that I thought ""Quarantine"" was a little slow and kinda boring, but this one was much, much better than that was. While it was a little creepy it didn't have that big of an effect on me because I watched this after ""Insidous"", which was about the scariest thing I've ever seen so this one seemed tame.  From what I saw, if you have seen the first ""Quarantine"" then you will be able to catch up with what is going on in this movie.  Overall, not really too much to say about this one, better then ""Quarantine"" and with ""Quarantine 2"" releasing soon I am interested to see if it will compare to this one.  I liked it.
