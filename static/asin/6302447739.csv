312920,A6HZN83OUPYRN,6302447739,976-ERIC,"[0, 0]","After a completely unrecognizable movie serial in the 1940s and two barely recognizable and silly tv movie pilots in 1979, Cap is back and more faithful to his comic book origins than ever. The WWII portion of this film is a lot of fun, the sets and dress is reminescent of the Golden Age of comics and the diner scene alone captures the sensibility of that era as good as anything in Donner's Superman or Burton's Batman. Cap's origin story is very faithful and his storming of the Red Skull's stronghold is good exciting action.Why we have an Italian Red Skull in the movie is bewildering, but we do, accent and all. *cringe* He looks pretty cool though and is appropiately greusome, but his prominent nose keeps his face from looking anything like a skull. Paulkin also does not have the menacing presence the character needs to be affective. The make-up helps in the WWII period, but once in present day the Skull gets plastic surgery (budget constraints?) and looses that aid. His English does improve, however, so we don't have to hear ""Capteen Amayreeca"" anymore, thank God!The best thing about this movie is Matt Salinger. Surrounded by silliness he gives the role a sincerity and authenticity. He is not smiling dumbly like Reb Brown or hamming it up ala Adam West. He takes the role seriously and emits a low key strength and confidence that serves this character as well as Chris Reeves' Superman. (It is interesting to note the irony in the son of iconoclastic writer J.D. Salinger portraying a character who is often used as a symbol of American jingoism.)However, this is strictly B-movie stuff. The script is full of the expected pithy sayings concerning American nationalism, what it is and what it isn't and (occasionally affective) dialogue reflecting the fear that America's day in the sun may have past it's high noon and the resilient fighting soldier spirit that refuses to give up. (They even manage to have the Red Skull throw in a ""next time we'll have made in Japan,"" concerning an American micro-radio transmitter that malfunctions.)Final verdit:  If you turn your brain on low, this is good two-fisted fun and Cap fans will want to see it atleast once for its faithfulness. The end is a rousing fist/gun/shield battle involving Cap, the President, the Skull and his minions. Should be on DVD, if only for historical purpose. Heck, the 1989 Punisher film is available.My Rating:  5/10",3,Halfway decent adaptation of the Marvel Comics Icon,1158796800,"09 21, 2006",2006,2411,"['completely', 'unrecognizable', 'movie', 'serial', '1940s', 'two', 'barely', 'recognizable', 'silly', 'tv', 'movie', 'pilots', '1979', 'Cap', 'back', 'more', 'faithful', 'comic', 'book', 'origins', 'ever', 'WWII', 'portion', 'film', 'lot', 'fun', 'sets', 'dress', 'reminescent', 'Golden', 'Age', 'comics', 'diner', 'scene', 'alone', 'sensibility', 'era', 'as', 'good', 'anything', 'Donner', 'Superman', 'Burton', 'Batman', 'Cap', 'origin', 'story', 'very', 'faithful', 'storming', 'Red', 'Skull', 'stronghold', 'good', 'exciting', 'action.Why', 'have', 'Italian', 'Red', 'Skull', 'movie', 'bewildering', 'do', 'accent', 'pretty', 'cool', 'appropiately', 'greusome', 'prominent', 'nose', 'keeps', 'face', 'looking', 'anything', 'skull', 'Paulkin', 'also', 'not', 'have', 'menacing', 'presence', 'character', 'be', 'affective', 'make-up', 'helps', 'WWII', 'period', 'once', 'present', 'day', 'Skull', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'budget', 'constraints', 'aid', 'English', 'improve', 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'hear', 'Capteen', 'Amayreeca', 'anymore', 'thank', 'God', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'Matt', 'Salinger', 'Surrounded', 'silliness', 'role', 'sincerity', 'authenticity', 'not', 'smiling', 'dumbly', 'Reb', 'Brown', 'hamming', 'up', 'ala', 'Adam', 'West', 'role', 'seriously', 'low', 'key', 'strength', 'confidence', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'Chris', 'Reeves', 'Superman', 'interesting', 'note', 'irony', 'son', 'iconoclastic', 'writer', 'J.D', 'Salinger', 'portraying', 'character', 'who', 'often', 'used', 'symbol', 'American', 'jingoism', 'However', 'strictly', 'B-movie', 'stuff', 'script', 'full', 'expected', 'pithy', 'sayings', 'concerning', 'American', 'nationalism', 'what', 'what', ""n't"", 'occasionally', 'affective', 'dialogue', 'reflecting', 'fear', 'America', 'day', 'sun', 'may', 'have', 'high', 'noon', 'resilient', 'fighting', 'soldier', 'spirit', 'give', 'up', 'even', 'manage', 'have', 'Red', 'Skull', 'throw', 'next', 'time', ""'ll"", 'have', 'made', 'Japan', 'concerning', 'American', 'micro-radio', 'transmitter', 'malfunctions', 'Final', 'verdit', 'turn', 'brain', 'low', 'good', 'two-fisted', 'fun', 'Cap', 'fans', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'atleast', 'once', 'faithfulness', 'end', 'rousing', 'fist/gun/shield', 'battle', 'involving', 'Cap', 'President', 'Skull', 'minions', 'Should', 'be', 'DVD', 'only', 'historical', 'purpose', 'Heck', '1989', 'Punisher', 'film', 'available.My', 'Rating', '5/10']",Captain America VHS

312923,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,6302447739,Andre Dursin,"[18, 19]","A strong Shout! Factory Blu-Ray of Albert Pyun's comic-book production that was shot for Menahem Golan's post-Cannon Group 21st Century Film Corporation but never theatrically released.Matt Salinger (nephew of J.D.) plays Steve Rogers as he fights the Red Skull both in the `40s and again after he's frozen in time; Scott Paulin essays his arch-nemesis while a better-than-the-movie-deserves supporting cast includes Ronny Cox, Ned Beatty, Darren McGavin, Michael Nouri and Melinda Dillon. ""Captain America"" does move along briskly and has a few fun moments but is basically let down by threadbare production values (there's a WLVI TV-56 Boston microphone during a White House press briefing!) and terrible editing. Pyun further claims his film was ruined by Golan in post-production, but this charge isn't entirely supported by his recent so-called ""Director's Cut"" that the director sold a couple of years ago on his website (sadly I was dumb enough to buy a copy; the Blu-Ray version looked like some third-gen Youtube video!).Particularly compared to the dramatic stylings of Reb Brown (who played Rogers in a pair of failed '70s TV pilots), Salinger is actually quite good as Cap -- the movie is more about Steve Rogers than the man in the suit, and there are intermittent moments where the film is effective. Tolkin's script, meanwhile, hits many of the same narrative buttons as the recent Marvel movie, but needed a more seasoned director and a stronger budget for it to come together.Nevertheless, Shout's Blu-Ray goes a long way to making the '90 ""Captain America"" respectable. Previously available as a manufactured-on-demand DVD release that recycled its old home video master, Shout's Blu-Ray of ""Captain America"" is a vast improvement on any prior presentation of the picture. The AVC encoded 1080p transfer is detailed and satisfying, opening up the old 4:3 frame for a bolder, more colorful widescreen image that immediately enhances the cramped full-screen release of every prior transfer. The stereo sound is fine, and extras include a brand new, 20-minute featurette with Pyun and the good-natured Salinger lamenting the production's thrifty production values. Recommended for Marvel completists, and a reminder to younger viewers that those of us who grew up in the `80s often had to endure movies like this as our source of superhero entertainment - a far cry from the mega-budget, and hugely entertaining, big-screen comic book flicks of today.",3,Blu-Ray Finally Does this Flawed Super-Hero Adventure Justice,1367539200,"05 3, 2013",2013,2466,"['strong', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'Blu-Ray', 'Albert', 'Pyun', 'comic-book', 'production', 'was', 'shot', 'Menahem', 'Golan', 'post-Cannon', 'Group', '21st', 'Century', 'Film', 'Corporation', 'never', 'theatrically', 'released.Matt', 'Salinger', 'nephew', 'J.D', 'Steve', 'Rogers', 'Red', 'Skull', '40s', 'again', 'frozen', 'time', 'Scott', 'Paulin', 'arch-nemesis', 'better-than-the-movie-deserves', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Ronny', 'Cox', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'Darren', 'McGavin', 'Michael', 'Nouri', 'Melinda', 'Dillon', 'Captain', 'America', 'move', 'briskly', 'few', 'fun', 'moments', 'basically', 'let', 'down', 'threadbare', 'production', 'values', 'WLVI', 'TV-56', 'Boston', 'microphone', 'White', 'House', 'press', 'briefing', 'terrible', 'editing', 'Pyun', 'further', 'claims', 'film', 'was', 'ruined', 'Golan', 'post-production', 'charge', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'supported', 'recent', 'so-called', 'Director', 'Cut', 'director', 'sold', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'website', 'sadly', 'was', 'dumb', 'enough', 'buy', 'copy', 'Blu-Ray', 'version', 'looked', 'third-gen', 'Youtube', 'video', '.Particularly', 'compared', 'dramatic', 'stylings', 'Reb', 'Brown', 'who', 'played', 'Rogers', 'pair', 'failed', ""'70s"", 'TV', 'pilots', 'Salinger', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'Cap', 'movie', 'more', 'Steve', 'Rogers', 'man', 'suit', 'are', 'intermittent', 'moments', 'where', 'film', 'effective', 'Tolkin', 'script', 'meanwhile', 'many', 'same', 'narrative', 'buttons', 'recent', 'Marvel', 'movie', 'needed', 'more', 'seasoned', 'director', 'stronger', 'budget', 'come', 'together.Nevertheless', 'Shout', 'Blu-Ray', 'long', 'way', 'making', ""'90"", 'Captain', 'America', 'respectable', 'Previously', 'available', 'manufactured-on-demand', 'DVD', 'release', 'recycled', 'old', 'home', 'video', 'master', 'Shout', 'Blu-Ray', 'Captain', 'America', 'vast', 'improvement', 'prior', 'presentation', 'picture', 'AVC', 'encoded', '1080p', 'transfer', 'detailed', 'satisfying', 'opening', 'up', 'old', '4:3', 'frame', 'bolder', 'more', 'colorful', 'widescreen', 'image', 'immediately', 'cramped', 'full-screen', 'release', 'prior', 'transfer', 'stereo', 'sound', 'fine', 'extras', 'include', 'brand', 'new', '20-minute', 'featurette', 'Pyun', 'good-natured', 'Salinger', 'lamenting', 'production', 'thrifty', 'production', 'values', 'Recommended', 'Marvel', 'completists', 'reminder', 'younger', 'viewers', 'who', 'grew', 'up', '80s', 'often', 'had', 'endure', 'movies', 'like', 'source', 'superhero', 'entertainment', 'far', 'cry', 'mega-budget', 'hugely', 'entertaining', 'big-screen', 'comic', 'book', 'flicks', 'today']",Captain America VHS

Fuchs, author of The Axiom-man Saga ""www...","[0, 0]","Taking part in a secret super soldier experiment in the 1940s, Steve Rogers becomes the American icon Captain America. After an altercation with the Red Skull, he is trapped in ice for fifty years before being thawed out in 1993. Upon awakening, Steve must come to grips with being a man out of time and also that the Red Skull is still alive and is leader of a powerful crime family. Steve must track down the Red Skull, with each clue giving more insight into his own past and bringing him one step closer to his arch enemy to settle a fight that began half a century before.This flick is your classic Captain America story, that is, his origin, his World War II beginnings, battling Red Skull, being frozen, awakening in the future and reconnecting with his old enemy who is still active.I remember seeing this as a kid and liking it. Saw it recently a few years back and still liked it. It&#8217;s not the greatest superhero movie, but it still holds its own all these years later.It&#8217;s very much Steve Rogers&#8217;s story as he&#8217;s Captain America for a little bit then isn&#8217;t for a good while, then is again in terms of him getting into costume. As a kid, you don&#8217;t care about story and just want to see the superhero. As an adult, you see the big picture so don&#8217;t mind the non-costumed parts. It&#8217;s a story about a journey, both for Steve and even for Red Skull as you watch Steve wrestle with himself for being from the past and how everything&#8217;s changed, and also the different things he finds out as he searches for his enemy.The Captain America costume is very rubbery, but it&#8217;s way better than the one that appeared in the 1979 movies and looks pretty good overall. The shield rocks and when Captain America throws it, it&#8217;s got that cool swooshing-through-the-air sound effect, adding to its power.I was totally fine with Matt Salinger as Steve Rogers. He had that all-American sensibility about him, was nave in the right ways, learned in others, and filled out those big red boots nicely.This is a solid Marvel movie that was made well before the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe of today and should be on the shelves of every superhero movie enthusiast out there.Recommended.",3,A 1990s Good Time,1389312000,"01 10, 2014",2014,2238,"['Taking', 'part', 'secret', 'super', 'soldier', 'experiment', '1940s', 'Steve', 'Rogers', 'American', 'icon', 'Captain', 'America', 'altercation', 'Red', 'Skull', 'trapped', 'ice', 'fifty', 'years', 'being', 'thawed', 'out', '1993', 'awakening', 'Steve', 'must', 'come', 'grips', 'being', 'man', 'time', 'also', 'Red', 'Skull', 'still', 'alive', 'leader', 'powerful', 'crime', 'family', 'Steve', 'must', 'track', 'down', 'Red', 'Skull', 'clue', 'giving', 'more', 'insight', 'own', 'past', 'bringing', 'one', 'step', 'closer', 'arch', 'enemy', 'settle', 'fight', 'began', 'century', 'before.This', 'flick', 'classic', 'Captain', 'America', 'story', 'origin', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'beginnings', 'battling', 'Red', 'Skull', 'being', 'frozen', 'awakening', 'future', 'reconnecting', 'old', 'enemy', 'who', 'still', 'active.I', 'remember', 'seeing', 'kid', 'liking', 'Saw', 'recently', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'still', 'liked', '8217', 'not', 'greatest', 'superhero', 'movie', 'still', 'own', 'years', 'later.It', '8217', 's', 'very', 'much', 'Steve', 'Rogers', '8217', 's', 'story', '8217', 'Captain', 'America', 'little', 'bit', 'then', 'isn', '8217', 't', 'good', 'while', 'then', 'again', 'terms', 'getting', 'costume', 'kid', 'don', '8217', 'care', 'story', 'just', 'want', 'see', 'superhero', 'adult', 'see', 'big', 'picture', 'don', '8217', 'mind', 'non-costumed', 'parts', '8217', 's', 'story', 'journey', 'Steve', 'even', 'Red', 'Skull', 'watch', 'Steve', 'wrestle', 'being', 'past', 'how', 'everything', '8217', 'changed', 'also', 'different', 'things', 'out', 'enemy.The', 'Captain', 'America', 'costume', 'very', 'rubbery', '8217', 's', 'way', 'better', 'one', 'appeared', '1979', 'movies', 'pretty', 'good', 'overall', 'shield', 'rocks', 'when', 'Captain', 'America', '8217', 'got', 'cool', 'swooshing-through-the-air', 'sound', 'effect', 'adding', 'power.I', 'was', 'totally', 'fine', 'Matt', 'Salinger', 'Steve', 'Rogers', 'had', 'all-American', 'sensibility', 'was', 'nave', 'right', 'ways', 'learned', 'others', 'filled', 'out', 'big', 'red', 'boots', 'nicely.This', 'solid', 'Marvel', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'well', 'whole', 'Marvel', 'Cinematic', 'Universe', 'today', 'should', 'be', 'shelves', 'superhero', 'movie', 'enthusiast', 'there.Recommended']",Captain America VHS

The acting is poorly executed, the plot often descends into silliness and the fake ears on the Captain America costume are ridiculous. Even worse is that the plot descends into the common pit that so many bad thrillers descend, blaming the villain of this movie for the assassination of John Kennedy.A brilliant Italian boy is kidnapped from his home before the Second World War by military forces led by an officer that looks a great deal like Benito Mussolini. His parents and others are killed in the abduction and the boy is then subjected to a process that will turn him into a super soldier. While the process works, his face is horribly disfigured and he becomes the deadly Red Skull, Captain America's longtime enemy.Shortly after this, weakling Steve Rogers volunteers to undergo a similar process in the United States. It is successful, but a Nazi agent kills the female scientist responsible for the process so Rogers is the only one that can be transformed. He then dons the uniform of Captain America and embarks on a mission to Europe to thwart the Red Skull.Easily defeated, Captain America is strapped to a rocket that is to be launched to destroy the American White House. The missile is launched but before it can hit the White House, Captain America kicks it off course (literally) and it crashes in the Arctic without detonating. Exactly how Captain America could survive the speed, cold and lack of oxygen while strapped to the outside of a rocket that had to leave the Earth's atmosphere and go supersonic is one that the scientist viewer can ponder without coming up with an answer. Captain America then remains frozen in the ice until a scientific research team discovers him approximately 40 years later.The Red Skull is still active and has been responsible for a great deal of the mayhem that has plagued the Earth since Captain America disappeared. A highly ranked American general with direct access to the president has turned traitor and is a member of the Red Skull's team. Therefore, it is up to the unthawed Captain and his newfound sidekick/girl friend to turn the tide and remove all of the threats.I know it is a bad movie when the only part that I found interesting enough to rewind and watch again was the scene where one of the evil women allies of the Red Skull is flipped over backwards and her skirt flies up.

The setting in the 40's certainly conjured up grand images of World War II with our hero fighting Red Skull in the midst of all of that. But this isn't it. It's not even a shadow of it. Even if you can forgive it for it's low budget effects, there is no getting around some of the dumbest casting choices in film history. Billy Mumy (aka Will Robinson from Lost in Space) as General Fleming...REALLY? Ned Beatty as an overgrown nerd turned newspaper reporter is hilarious. And Darren McGavin (aka the Night Stalker from the early 70's) as the 'evil' backstabbing government insider is just about as believable as a dark Mr. Rogers. And let's not even get started with the lead role played by Matt Salinger. His goody two-shoes attitude would make a 40 year old virgin blush. You know there's a reason why Salinger hasn't done much in his acting career. It's because he didn't have a career in acting.Let's be honest. If you can rationalize this film as somehow being a good movie, your either drowning in bad taste or are most likely blinded by some false sense of nostalgia that shouldn't be there. The dialogue and acting makes the TV movies of Capt America look award winning. Cap's suit looks like an air brushed scuba suit. And everyone in the film looks like they were held at gun point to say some of the dumbest lines in film history. Do yourself a favor. If you have a positive memory of this movie, don't buy it.

It was made in 1990, before Marvel Comics really got into making their own films. Matt Salinger portrays a believable Steve Rogers/Captain America.

The acting is spotty, the music is cheesy, it had so much quick cuts that it's nauseating, and the whole production value feels like it was made straight for a TV movie.  However, despite being an underwhelming effort, I don't hate this movie.  The film didn't make me throw a fit, feel uncomfortable, or have any homicidal tendencies towards anyone involved in the production, because it's pretty straightforward in what the film tried to be.While the majority of the cast gave a B-grade performance, at least they don't make themselves sound goofy or attempt to retort a corny one-liner.  I actually like Scott Paulin's role as The Red Skull, because while the actor can't seem to decide if he wanted to be a crime boss or a supervillain, he kept his character low-key; his smooth and serious attitude actually made him appear intimidating, at least he's not acting like a Power Ranger villainlike a certain androgynous nemesis from a flaming skull movie.  The president of this movie is quite helpful in saving the day; sure, he's not Bill Pullman from ""Independence Day"", but he can put up a fight when he's in danger. As for Matt Salinger as Captain America, he's not really a good actor, but he did the best to be patriotic with his role.  I don't think the movie really needs one actress to play two characters, it feels like a lazy attempt to establish a familiar new love interest for the hero.The plot is quite a mess, no way around it.  How did Red Skull know all about Captain America's name when they first met?  How did Red Skull manage to stay fit even though he's around 80 years old after the timeskip?  How did America's top security manage to let The President get kidnapped in his own country?  How did Captain America's manage to get from Alaska to California on a non-stop car ride with a single gas tank?  Why are Red Skull's minions consist of Italian models?  Aside from these uncertain plot elements, this is about as simple as it gets: American supersoldier fights Nazi supersoldier.  Although the film's done on the cheap, the special effects weren't that bad at the time; seeing CapAm throws his disk at objects was quite impressive, if a bit too floaty.Once the reboot ""Captain America"" movie comes out, regardless of quality, this oldie would be ignored and thrown out like a scab.  I won't sympathize with this one, but it's not quite the disaster people make it out to be.

312939,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6302447739,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[3, 4]","It was 1990 and  for many of us who were collecting comic books, the '90s was a decade of the re-emergence of comic book collecting, interest in the superheroes from years past and for many superhero films, before they were the big budget summer blockbusters as they are today, they were independent films.In 1989, there was ""The Punisher"" and the following year, there was ""Captain America"" (to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Captain America) which was released in several countries outside of the U.S. but in America, it went direct-to-video.And I can easily remember going to the video store, highly anticipating this film (and also the ""Fantastic Four"" film that came out in 1994) and thinking, it has to be way better than the '70s ""Captain America"" films right?Well, with the release of ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" in theaters, sure enough, we have ""Captain America"", the 1990 film released on Blu-ray via a Collector's Edition release.The film is directed by Albert Pyun (""The Sword and the Sorcerer"", ""Cyborg"", ""Kickboxer 4: The Aggressor"") and is written by Stephen Tolkin (who would later become the co-executive producer of ""Brothers & Sisters"", ""Legend of the Seeker"", ""Summerland"") and Lawrence Block.VIDEO:Captain America"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:33:1).  In my original DVD review, I wrote about how the video was nothing to write home about because it was a low budget film from the early '90s.  But watching it on Blu-ray, I'm amazed of how much better the Blu-ray looks versus any video version I have seen in the past.  Even the outdoor scenes look a lot better.  Granted, there is that hint of softness but still, the film looks so much better on Blu-ray!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Captain America"" is presented in DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0.  Dialogue is crystal clear including the 1990 synth music.  A front-channel driven lossless soundtrack but definitely better than its previously released DVD version.SPECIAL FEATURES""Captain America"" comes with the following special features:Looking Back at Captain America - (20:05) A fascinating interview with Director Albert Pyun and actor Matt Salinger of how budget cuts and a very short schedule made the film different from the Tolkin script.  For Pyun, he wanted to make a Captain America film in the spirit of the comic books but the producers and studio wanted a Clark Kent/Superman style storyline.  Salinger talks about the difficult of wearing the latex suit during the humid hot summer and his thoughts on the film and how much the film deviated from the script due to the small budget and shortened schedule.JUDGMENT CALL:In my original review, I wrote that ""Captain America"" is a bad film.  But the fact was that director Albert Pyun was put in a situation where they didn't have any budget to execute any major action scenes and with a shortened schedule and being told that their would be followup shooting after shooting in Yugoslavia...it just didn't happen.  In fact, Pyun was so disappointed that he didn't want to see the final cut of the film after it was all done.  The entertaining script that Stephen Tolkin had originally written was turned to something else by the studio who wanted to emphasize a different Captain America, while Pyun was dedicated to featuring the Steve Rogers/Captain America that he grew up reading in the comic books.With that being said, if you watch a lot of the older Marvel films, definitely don't watch these with the highest of expectations because they are quite cheesy.But I'm going to be truthful, during this time, like many other comic book collectors, obtaining these superhero films was not easy.  I can remember friends trying to get this film and the ""Fantastic Four"" film from conventions and they were in the nastiest conditions.  For me, I found a rental copy from a video store and watched it with a few friends.Yes, it was cheesy and definitely not so faithful to the comic books and while it was a cheesy adaptation, somehow many of us back then wanted these films not so much because they were bad films but because they were superhero films.  A step-up from the old '70s films and of course, it's one thing to say how much this film sucks compared to ""Captain America: The First Avenger"", these films didn't have the greatest budget and the superhero films from Marvel were not in the same position as their rival DC, which was doing well with the big budget Michael Keaton ""Batman"" films.But at that time, Captain America fans or Marvel fans wanted to grab a copy of these films because we were collectors.But watching in today, in 2013 and seeing how times have changed where both Marvel and DC are now making the big-budget blockbuster superhero films, these older films... they are no doubt, forgotten films that are now looked at as just slightly better than the '70s films but that's not saying much.  Watching it today, it's just a bad film, bad adaptation, bad music (you have to enjoy how they try to redo popular songs in a different arrangement ala Duran Duran's ""Girls on Film"") but still, I'm sure there are Captain America fans who still want to own a copy of this Blu-ray as their original VHS probably is unwatchable by now.With this Blu-ray release, there are a few things that Shout! Factory has done that makes this release much better than the 2011 DVD release and it's the fact that the film is presented in 1080p High Definition. Picture quality is so much better than the original DVD and because of many outdoor scenes that the film was shot, colors are so much better and the film doesn't look 1990.  I was surprised by how much better this film looks in HD versus its 2011 DVD counterpart.  So you get the 1080p High Definition and a lossless 2.0 DTS-HD MA soundtrack.But possibly the biggest addition which I wanted to see in the first DVD release was a special feature with director Albert Pyun and star Matt Salinger and this is where Shout! Factory has delivered.  Not only do you get a cool 20-minute featurette, both men really go into detail of the problems they ran into shooting this film, but both emphasizing how they had only so much they can work with, because of the very small budget and shortened schedule.And what happened after the film was done and what happened to the shield and the latex suit!  Those questions are answered in this Blu-ray release!So, while the 2011 DVD should appease fans, this Blu-ray release for 2013 is so much better! And the even better news is that this Blu-ray release is still budget priced at $11.  IWhile I can't recommend this film to the masses, especially those who are so used to today's Marvel films, I'm sure there are Marvel/Captain America fans who may have some fondness in their hearts or for memorabilia sake to watch this film all over again and will want this Blu-ray release.  This was how Marvel films were back in the 1990&#8242;s, they were not the big money making machine summer blockbuster films they are now.For nostalgic Marvel/Captain America fans, if you enjoyed the film, it is definitely worth upgrading your VHS or DVD version to this 2013 Blu-ray release of ""Captain America: Collector's Edition"".",3,An improvement over the DVD version and has an informative

The rest of the film carefully follows this same formula: hint, never show.  Seven years later, Captain America is introduced as a failed hero.  For all his gosh-golly pluck and determination, the clod doesn't stand a chance against super villain Red Skull, a yappy red headed fop.  Strapped to a rocket destined for the White House, Captain America manages to make a detour to Alaska instead.  The years roll by.........I wish this movie did as well.  Director Albert Pyun admits this wasn't the movie he set out to make, blaming the results on too much interference, a lousy budget, and a lot of rules from Marvel.  What he wanted to make was a movie about Steve Rogers, who just happened to be Captain America in his spare time.  This is as close as he could get to that vision.  Either way, he was doomed to fail.  Character studies do not make great action flicks.  I could care less that Steve Rogers smoked, was faithful to his honey back home, or wanted to be a guinea pig for the government when he grew up.  It's the suit, the shield, and the adventure that's important.  Nefarious plots to thwart, villains to outwit, people to save, that's what it's all about.  This movie doesn't quite manage to do any of that.  The stunts are limited, the car chases lame, the mob of thugs just preppy dressing clones, and Red Skull has a botched face lift that despoils his moniker.  ""Holy mackerel!""  At the end it even tosses in a commercial of sorts for ecology!  It's not so much where they went wrong as when.........at the very beginning.But it does look nice in Blu-ray.",3,"""Steve.

What the hell did you expect?I for one thought it was fantastic entertainment.  Now, I'll be honest, I have never read one single ""Captain America"" comic book in my life, so I have no clue whether this film sticks close to the comics.  But that didn't stop me from having a helluva good time watching it!The plot was cool and full of surprises.  The action scenes were straight out of a comic book panel!  The acting wasn't the best, but it wasn't bad, either.  Red Skull, however, was a superb villain and great fun to watch.  And the music was excellent, and followed the footsteps of John William's score for ""Superman"" and Danny Elfman's ""Batman"" theme.While this is not one of my all-time favorite comic book movies, it's on the top ten.

312944,ADWQPR0LJD4J,6302447739,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[7, 9]","Before 1998's ""Blade,"" Marvel Comics couldn't seem to catch a break when it came to movie versions of their different properties. In the wake of ""iron Man 3"" and ""The Avengers,"" I know that's very hard to believe. There was a serial for Captain America released in 1944 through Republic Pictures. George Lucas executive produced a live-action adaptation of ""Howard the Duck"" in 1986.The next few years up to Wesley Snipes' take on the legendary vampire slayer were plagued with low-budget versions of the comic book publisher's characters. Dolph Lundgren's ""The Punisher"" couldn't even muster a theatrical release in the U.S. Roger Corman's ""The Fantastic Four"" never officially saw the light of day anywhere, although bootleg copies float around.21st Century Film Corporation released ""Captain America"" straight to video in the middle of those two disasters. For many years, the movie was hard to get a hold of and only released on VHS. Shout! Factory released it on DVD and made it widely available to those who sought it out for so many years as a sort of Nerd Holy Grail. Now they've went one step further by giving the 1990 cult classic a high definition upgrade.Several years after being caught by Red Skull and left for dead, Steve Rogers is found frozen in the ice and thawed out. He discovers Red Skull received plastic surgery to hide his true identity and is heading up a group of world leaders set on kidnapping the President of the United States for their own diabolical ambitions.Is ""Captain America"" filled with cheese? If you judge it from a modern standpoint, of course it is. If you look at it as being a piece of World War II propaganda filmed in the 1940s, you'll find it totally hits its mark. That's the standpoint I choose to view it from.My only real issue is that we only get about 5 minutes of face time from the real Red Skull. The rest of the film features actor Scott Paulin in flesh-colored make-up topped with scar lines. It's a real letdown for fans of the Red Skull who wanted to see the character the way he looks in the comic books.The hi-def video transfer for ""Captain America"" will no doubt leave geeks giggling in glee. There are many out there who have longed for this movie in a suitable home entertainment format since DVDs became the standard. Have no fear, as Shout! Factory delivers the ultimate version with near-perfect picture quality. The 2.0 stereo is adequate and gives the sound effects, dialogue, and musical score ample room to breathe and spread out.The only bonus material found on the Collector's Edition Blu-ray is a brand new featurette entitled ""Looking Back at 'Captain America' with Director Albert Pyun and Star Matt Salinger."" It's evident that Pyun and Salinger's lofty visions for ""Captain America"" were grounded by very limited finances. Salinger comes across as extremely devoted to bringing the character of Steve Rogers and Captain America to life onscreen. You can tell from the atmosphere and the camerawork that Pyun did everything he could to stretch the dollars he was given. In the end, you can tell they were both disappointed in the outcome.I still think that ""Captain America"" gets way more flack for being cheesy and low budget than it deserves. Is it on the same quality level as ""Captain America: The First Avenger?"" No way! However, it has an inviting and personal flavor to it that still works 23 years later. Real comic book fans will find value in this adaption and appreciate it for what it is.",3,"Blu-ray Review: ""Captain America: Collector's Edition""",1369180800,"05 22, 2013",2013,3481,"['1998', 'Blade', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'could', ""n't"", 'seem', 'catch', 'break', 'when', 'came', 'movie', 'versions', 'different', 'properties', 'wake', 'iron', 'Man', '3', 'Avengers', 'know', 'very', 'hard', 'believe', 'was', 'serial', 'Captain', 'America', 'released', '1944', 'Republic', 'Pictures', 'George', 'Lucas', 'executive', 'produced', 'live-action', 'adaptation', 'Howard', 'Duck', '1986.The', 'next', 'few', 'years', 'up', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'take', 'legendary', 'vampire', 'slayer', 'were', 'plagued', 'low-budget', 'versions', 'comic', 'book', 'publisher', 'characters', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'Punisher', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'muster', 'theatrical', 'release', 'U.S.', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'never', 'officially', 'saw', 'light', 'day', 'anywhere', 'bootleg', 'copies', 'float', 'around.21st', 'Century', 'Film', 'Corporation', 'released', 'Captain', 'America', 'straight', 'video', 'middle', 'two', 'disasters', 'many', 'years', 'movie', 'was', 'hard', 'get', 'hold', 'only', 'released', 'VHS', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'released', 'DVD', 'made', 'widely', 'available', 'who', 'sought', 'out', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'sort', 'Nerd', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'went', 'one', 'step', 'further', 'giving', '1990', 'cult', 'high', 'definition', 'upgrade.Several', 'years', 'being', 'caught', 'Red', 'Skull', 'left', 'dead', 'Steve', 'Rogers', 'found', 'frozen', 'ice', 'thawed', 'out', 'Red', 'Skull', 'received', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'hide', 'true', 'identity', 'heading', 'up', 'group', 'world', 'leaders', 'set', 'kidnapping', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'own', 'diabolical', 'ambitions.Is', 'Captain', 'America', 'filled', 'cheese', 'judge', 'modern', 'standpoint', 'course', 'look', 'being', 'piece', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'propaganda', 'filmed', '1940s', ""'ll"", 'find', 'totally', 'mark', 'standpoint', 'choose', 'view', 'only', 'real', 'issue', 'only', 'get', '5', 'minutes', 'face', 'time', 'real', 'Red', 'Skull', 'rest', 'film', 'features', 'actor', 'Scott', 'Paulin', 'flesh-colored', 'make-up', 'topped', 'scar', 'lines', 'real', 'letdown', 'fans', 'Red', 'Skull', 'who', 'wanted', 'see', 'character', 'way', 'comic', 'books.The', 'hi-def', 'video', 'transfer', 'Captain', 'America', 'will', 'doubt', 'leave', 'geeks', 'giggling', 'glee', 'are', 'many', 'who', 'have', 'longed', 'movie', 'suitable', 'home', 'entertainment', 'format', 'DVDs', 'became', 'standard', 'Have', 'fear', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'ultimate', 'version', 'near-perfect', 'picture', 'quality', '2.0', 'stereo', 'adequate', 'sound', 'effects', 'dialogue', 'musical', 'score', 'ample', 'room', 'breathe', 'spread', 'out.The', 'only', 'bonus', 'material', 'found', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'Blu-ray', 'brand', 'new', 'featurette', 'entitled', 'Looking', 'Back', ""'Captain"", 'America', 'Director', 'Albert', 'Pyun', 'Star', 'Matt', 'Salinger', 'evident', 'Pyun', 'Salinger', 'lofty', 'visions', 'Captain', 'America', 'were', 'grounded', 'very', 'limited', 'finances', 'Salinger', 'extremely', 'devoted', 'bringing', 'character', 'Steve', 'Rogers', 'Captain', 'America', 'life', 'onscreen', 'can', 'tell', 'atmosphere', 'camerawork', 'Pyun', 'did', 'everything', 'could', 'stretch', 'dollars', 'was', 'given', 'end', 'can', 'tell', 'were', 'disappointed', 'outcome.I', 'still', 'think', 'Captain', 'America', 'way', 'more', 'flack', 'being', 'cheesy', 'low', 'budget', 'same', 'quality', 'level', 'Captain', 'America', 'First', 'Avenger', 'way', 'However', 'inviting', 'personal', 'flavor', 'still', '23', 'years', 'later', 'Real', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'value', 'adaption', 'appreciate', 'what']",Captain America VHS

312949,A6VFFRIHAXKRL,6302447739,"J. Paul ""John doe""","[0, 0]","Before my review I want to say I have seen the trailers & TV spots for the new Captain America movie I really want to see it. But there's another Captain America movie released in the early 90's  I heard how awful it was I saw it & I don't mind it it's good as a stand alone movie maybe that's because I'm not a big Captain America fan I knew about the character through The Spider Man animated show in the 90's but as for the movie I have seen much, much, much, much, much worse than Captain America 1990. I could easily watch this over Batman & Robin or Punisher Warzone or Crow Salvation & Wicked Prayer or X Men Orgins Wolverine & oh he  l  l  yeah even X Men First Nap that's what I call it. & for all you First Class fanboys don't even think about leaving comment you're not changing my mind. This was going to be released in theasters in the summer of 90 it kept getting pushed back until it went straight to video. Ok the movie was directed by Albert Pyun he directed Cyborg which I have heard his directors cut is bad he wants to release his directors cut of this movie he also directed Kickboxer 2 yeah that was good sequel (being sarcastic.) Stars Matt Salinger as Steve Rodgers aka Captain America, Kim Gillingham as Bernice Stewart as well as Sharon Stewart, Scott Paulin as The Red Skull, & Ronny Cox as President Tom Kimball. You start off with this Italian Kid who is kidnaped his family is gunned down by the fascist government. There going to turn him into the ultimate super soldier. There is this Doctor that is against it she escapes & comes to America. We then go to 1943 where we are introduced to Steve Rodgers he can't be in WW II cause of his polio he has volunteered  to become a super soldier 1 of the people who created it was that same Doctor she keeps the formula in her head. However a spy snuck in & kills the Doctor. Well Captain America's 1st mission is to stop The Na  z  i's from launching a missile at The White House ok I didn't know The Axis had that capability. Captain America has a battle with The Red Skull, & the make up effects are great why didn't he appear like this through out the whole movie. Captain America gets his a  s  s beat like a pu z  zy he strapped to a dank looking rocket & flies far far away. Were also introduced to this kid he grows up to become The President this could've been cut out. Anyway missile lands in Alaska he remains there for 50 years. So 50 years later you have President Kimball trying to pass a law that doesn't sit well with 1 of his Generals well we meet a group led by The Red Skull who had plastic surgery & guess what he's responsible for The Assassinations of JFK MLK. He wants to put a brain implant into Kimball & control him. Captain America's frozn body is discovered he awakens & he still thinks he's in The 40's. An ok action scene where The Red Skull's Daughter is after him he gets a ride from this reporter that happens to be a childhood friend of President Kimball's. I don't know whose idea it was but faking being sick to steal peoples vehicles. What's up with that?  Cap makes his way back to California his old Girlfriend Bernice still lives in her same home. She has long since married. Later on there Daughter Sharon takes him to her apartment & shows him all what has gone on. Some of The Red Skull's henchies go to Cap's old girlfriends house kill her & wound her husband. Oh yeah the reporter was there too he was killed.So Sharon has a vendetta now.  During a conference in Rome The President is captured.  They go & look for that Doctors journal for info on The Red Skull,  Those henchies follow them & you get a decent action scene. They go to Italy & another faking sick scene. The get a recording of when The Red Skull's parents were killed. It really didn't do much it went no where. There being followee & you get a pretty good action scene. The part with the bike is like wtf. They are still being followed. Sharon allows herself to be captured we finally get to see Steve Rodgers in The Captain America gear there is too much Steve Rodgers not enough Cap. President Kimball escalate his cell you have him & Captain America team up. Ronny Cox you could see had some fun it was like he knew it was a bad movie. Kim Gillingham you could see she had fun with her role. You get a good action scene with Captain America going After The Red Skull. Red Skull pulls out a remote control explosive device. Captain America plays the tape where his parents are killed. Cap throws his shield at him Red Skull falls to his death. His Daughter tries to kill him she's decapited by his returning shield & that's basically the movie. I feel this movie is over hated but needed a big budget & I guarantee you that the new Captain America is better. $10 million isn't enough. New World could do a low budget like The Punisher cause it didn't call for spectacular  special effects. The faking sick thing was dumb Red Skull's back story wasn't needed. I've people say it has a terrible pace I felt it was fine had a fast pace you want a bad pace watch X Men First Nap. Matt Salinger was good I felt Ronny Cox did a good job. Kim Gillingham was likable  enough. Scott Paulin was decent. That's my review hopefully I 'll review the new Captain America film. I'll see what else I can review next.",3,I can't believe  I don't hate this movie 7/10,1311897600,"07 29, 2011",2011,5289,"['review', 'want', 'say', 'have', 'seen', 'trailers', 'TV', 'spots', 'new',

Now that we have a mega budget Captain America, I went back and got this to re watch. It comes on a made on demand disc, with no restoration , but doesn't look awful, except for a few scenes look washed out a bit. Matt Salinger who plays Steve Rogers in this, was kind of wimpy acting most of the time and even smacked a couple of women with a cafe table. (they were bad women). And he looks alot like a young Mel Gibson. The Red skull looked great at the beginning,but some one dropped the ball and made the decision to give him plastic surgery face  the rest of the time. The script is simple and silly at times, but had some neat ideas with the president as a child etc...The worst part of the movie personally, was the Red Skull's henchmen were all young colledge kids dressed in preppy sweaters and deck shoes??? I suppose that was just the fashion at the time but seems painful to look at now. And I swear it had a different theme song at the end on other copies I saw. I'm glad I finally have a copy of this for my super hero DVD cllection.  If you are a Super Hero, or Captain America fan, you'd probably like it as well.

For better or for worse, this movie is what it is...and if you don't know what that is, you probably shouldn't make this a ""blind-buy"".  I grew up with it, so I happen to like it...but I do not like this DVD.Immediately, it starts out with a warning, claiming something along the lines of ""This is the best source we could find.""  TRANSLATION: ""We couldn't be bothered to make a new transfer, so enjoy this old one.  And, thanks for the cash.""As far as I can tell, MGM's MOD edition recycles the one made for the 1992 VHS and LaserDisc versions.  Video is a cropped 4x3 full screen presentation.  I had hoped it was open-matte, but after comparing it to a UK edition, I am certain it has been cropped.And, like the '92 VHS and LD releases, quality is quite poor.  Colors are washed-out, the picture is soft, there is heavy grain, and loads of rainbow-artifacts grace the image.Oh, I forgot to mention the compression problems.  Yep, this baby has some pretty big areas of block noise during some of the fast moving action scenes (like the machine gun fire at night during the early portions of the film).Audio is Dolby stereo and sounds adequate, but has some occasional pops.  And, I also think I heard some mild ""hiss"" at times.  However, given that I am sending this back to Amazon in a hurry, I don't have time to check it more thoroughly.As for extras, a theatrical trailer is included.  I would say ""hooray"", but the quality of the movie itself has left me quite apathetic.In closing, MGM has delivered the legal equivalent to all the ""bootlegs"" floating around the ""grey market""...complete with being on a DVD-R disc.

The Cap costume has rubber ears, instead of using the actors real ears-it's a little distracting.Again, this is the most faithful adaptation we have: better than the 1944 serial, better than the 70's Reb Brown TV movies, but what will really be better is the new Marvel Studios version that should be coming out after Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk.Not one you need to own, but if you're a Captain America fan pick it up.",4,Closest thing to the comics...for now.,1208908800,"04 23, 2008",2008,1466,"['have', 'several', 'film/TV', 'versions', 'Captain', 'America', 'going', 'back', '1940', 'one', 'closest', 'adaptation', 'comics.The', 'movie', 'not', 'fantastic', 'means', 'have', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'think', 'bad.The', 'Good', '-The', 'costume', 'shield', 'are', 'faithful', 're-creations', 'classic', 'Cap', 'look', 'are', 'actually', 'used', 'film.-We', 'actually', 'get', 'see', 'Red', 'Skull', 'Red', 'Skull', 'even', 'only', 'short', 'while.-The', 'story', 'contains', 'footage', 'Cap', 'WWII', 'being', 'frozen', 'ice', 'then', 'being', 'unfrozen', 'present', 'day', 'comic', 'stories.-There', 'are', 'actually', 'great', 'story', 'points', 'Steve', 'going', 'see', 'OLD', 'girlfriend', 'Red', 'Skull', 'calling', 'Cap', 'American', 'Brother', '.-Also', 'storyline', 'reporter', 'President', 'who', 'idolized', 'Captain', 'America', 'kids', 'how', 'present', 'day', 'neat.The', 'Bad', '-The', 'acting', 'pretty', 'terrible', 'exception', 'Ned', 'Beatty.-The', 'action', 'effects', 'are', 'little', 'slow.-And', 'course', 'RUBBER', 'EARS', 'Cap', 'costume', 'rubber', 'ears', 'instead', 'using', 'actors', 'real', 'ears-it', 'little', 'distracting.Again', 'most', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'have', 'better', '1944', 'serial', 'better', '70', 'Reb', 'Brown', 'TV', 'movies', 'what', 'will', 'really', 'be', 'better', 'new', 'Marvel', 'Studios', 'version', 'should', 'be', 'coming', 'out', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Incredible', 'Hulk.Not', 'one', 'need', 'own', ""'re"", 'Captain', 'America', 'fan', 'pick', 'up']",Captain America VHS

The Red-Skull isn't German anymore, there's no Bucky Barnes, & as portrayed in the movie, Cap had only ONE mission during World War Two.  (He's supposed to have had an illustrious career as a spy-smasher up till the end of the European War.)Oh well.  I don't mind if the screen-writers take liberties with the original stories.  After all, Sam Raimi took a few for the recent ""Spider-Man"" movie.  But ""Captain-America"", with the exception of the costume, is way off from the original.Hopefully, now that Stan Lee has more clout in Hollywood because of the recent ""Spider-Man"" movie, maybe they can try again with ""Cap""...and this time...get it right!",2,Close...But Not Quite,1022112000,"05 23, 2002",2002,935,"['one', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'based', 'Golden', 'Age', 'comic-character', 'costume', 'Matt', 'Salinger', 'costume', 'LOOKS', 'Captain', 'America', 'least', 'lot', 'more', 'Reb', 'Brown', 'did', 'motorcycle-outfit', '1970', 'Captain-America', 'made', 'tv', 'movies', 'Red-Skull', ""n't"", 'German', 'anymore', 'Bucky', 'Barnes', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'Cap', 'had', 'only', 'ONE', 'mission', 'World', 'War', 'Two', 'supposed', 'have', 'had', 'illustrious', 'career', 'spy-smasher', 'up', 'end', 'European', 'War', 'Oh', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'screen-writers', 'take', 'liberties', 'original', 'stories', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'took', 'few', 'recent', 'Spider-Man', 'movie', 'Captain-America', 'exception', 'costume', 'way', 'original.Hopefully', 'now', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'more', 'clout', 'Hollywood', 'recent', 'Spider-Man', 'movie', 'maybe', 'can', 'try', 'again', 'Cap', 'time', 'get', 'right']",Captain America VHS

312965,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,6302447739,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[0, 0]","In a word? Bad. More than one word? Has potential, but ends up sucking. What you have here is a movie that sounds good on the treatment and even looks promising when looking at the script. However in execution falls flat on many levels. To be fair this version of Captain America has its good moments. The problem is they are too few and are outweighed by the very bad elements of this film.I'm still trying to fathom the thinking behind making this movie. 21st Century Film is a small operation. I get that. However when you look at this film, that was made in the early 90's, it looks like it was done in the 70's. I'm not just talking about cinematography and quality of cameras. I'm talking plot structure, music, special effects, stunt work, a whole of lot of elements that make a movie. It all feels like this movie should have been seen as a TV movie alongside 70's Wonder Woman and Spider-Man. More care really should have been taken putting it together instead of trying to get it released in time for Captain America's 50th anniversary (which they missed that deadline anyway).Where to begin? Lets start with the story as it is the more complicated aspect that shows some good elements as well as bad. On the good side we have a pretty tidy explanation about how ole' Cap gets his abilities and why we don't have an army of shield wielding super soldiers. The backstory of Steve Rogers and his 40's sensibility and how he copes with waking in the modern world has a good deal of heart to it.And... that's about it. Now we have to deal with the atrociously disconnected origin story of arch nemesis The Red Skull that starts off with the massacre of his entire family and moves from there to his callous treatment as a child. You would think after all this Red Skull would take vengeance on his ""benefactors"", but instead we are supposed to assume this history merely explains why he is a bad guy because he was treated bad. Doesn't really connect on film that way. Once you get past the origin and back stories the main plot tends to just coast in neutral throughout the film. What motivates the baddies into being bad is yawn worthy. What motivates Captain America to save the day? Seems like the answer is ""just because.""What makes the story shortcomings even worse is the inane actions that fill up space in between exposition. You get bland scenes like Captain America sneaking away from the good guys for some reason or another, villains following good guys and being stereotypically mean to people. And don't get me started on the action scenes. The movie either feels like it's in a standstill or actually gets more boring with the fights. And this is in spite of the fact the studio re-shot stunts after test screenings.Technical aspects of this movie hurt it the most. Like I said before the camera footage looks very cheap and not much attention was made on maximizing the use of camera angles for dramatic effect. Lighting and special effects (mostly practical) further reinforce that dated look to the film. Makeup effects are actually serviceable in regards to the Red Skull's face. The one thing that stands out the most is Captain America's costume uses fake ears on his cowl. It's almost embarrassing seeing any close ups of Cap in full costume.The acting is a mixed bag of B-Movie style nonchalance from supporting characters and some pretty decent acting from the primary. Ned Beatty does a pretty good job with what little he had to work with walking the fine line between believable reporter and comic relief. Matt Salinger actually does a good performance and gives you that feeling that his character is from a simpler time.So this movie was intended to be released to capitalize on Captain America's 50th anniversary. Maybe that's why the cheap production values as the studio was more focused on cashing in on the timeliness. Well it looks like they did it again. This DVD was also intended to be re-released to coincide with the new theatrical release of Marvel Studio's Captain America: The First Avenger. Instead the released was pushed back a couple months and now has that onerous feeling that it's an intended bait and switch for people thinking it's the new movie out on DVD early. Sorry if you got duped, but I'm sure the packaging gave off some warning signs.While this release is the latest and ""greatest"" there is only so much polish you can put on a turd. The source material was very cheap film stock to begin with and I doubt any amount of remastering will make it look any better than the 70's TV show vibe it started out with. In other words no high fidelity images and lots of specks and scratches. I think the audio fares a little better on Dolby Digital Stereo than previous releases, but it's been a while since I rented the old version. The only special feature includes is the ""Theatrical Trailer"", which is ironic as it was straight to video release in the United States with very limited theatrical release internationally.So should you buy this DVD? No way. Not unless you already seen this movie and really like it. In that case this is the best (and likely last) release available. The rest of you who may be curious rent first... preferably via uber-cheap RedBox or Netlix subscription.",2,The 90's weren't good to him,1321315200,"11 15, 2011",2011,5248,"['word', 'Bad', 'More',

Although it received a European release, it was shelved in the U.S. until 1992.  I thought it was a good low budget attempt to bring the Joe Simon-Jack Kirby comic book character to life.

This movie has a great cast: Matt Salinger, Scott Paulin, Ronny Cox, Ned Beatty, Darren McGavin, Carla Cassola,  Melinda Dillion, Michael Nouri, Kim Gillingham Francesca Neri and Billy Mumy.  It was directed by Albert Pyun.In Italy during WW2, Dr. Maria Vaseli (Carla Cassola) creates a process which transforms child musical prodigy Tadzio de Santis into the hideously scarred 'Red Skull' (Scott Paulin) for the Nazis. Dr. Vaseli escapes to America where she perfects the process and helps the American Military transform Polio-ridden Steve Rogers into the Star Spangled Avenger 'Captain America' (Matt Salinger).  Aided by two Resistance Fighters (Scene deleted), Captain America to a hidden Nazi Fortress, Captain America encounters his nemesis, the Red Skull,  where he is defeated and strapped to a rocket that the Nazis are planning to launch launch at the White House to kill President Roosevelt.  Cap heroically manages to stop the rocket from crashing into the White House; but it crashes in the Alaskan Tundra where he is frozen for the next 50 years.While Captain America is frozen, the Red Skull and plots and successfully carries out the deaths of John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King with the help of a group of international businessmen and General Fleming (Mumy/McGavin).  Now, they are planning on kidnapping President Kimball (Cox) and controlling his mind to do their evil bidding.  Luckily for the Red, White and Blue, Cap is accidently found by an Alaskan Surveying Team and thawed out where upon he tried to return home and while he finds that things have drastically changed; Captain America is torn between duty and the love of his former girlfriend, Bernice (Gillingham).
