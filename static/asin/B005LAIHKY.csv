I measured when, for me the thing began to fall apart- 101:13. It was around there when the writer went to a movielover's subtext to maintain the narrative of the film. Movielover's subtext? Vampires represent the oppressive feudal lords of europe, bleeding their peasants dry with oppressive logic which claims their lifelong debt to their feudal lord.  The writer picks up this subtext in earnest around 101:13 and tries to play with it, toggling between camp and brainy fun in the background. You know the script is in trouble when it drags out Alice Cooper to hot things up at 1:26:08. Sure, there are some vague hints toward the philosophical  subtext of the entire vampire genre, but the feints are not clear, instead, shrouded in campy reference which clouds the reason behind the gag. The end, though, returns to victorian camp, with generous footage of slashing, splashing waves and a weepy part which gives heart to the conclusion.

Whatever the case may be, the 2012 ""Dark Shadows"" is an imperfect but -- surprisingly -- intermittently charming film that reaffirms how good an actor Johnny Depp can be.The star's performance as Barnabas Collins - a Maine vampire who awakens in the early `70s after having slept for over 200 years, only to find his ancestors on the downturn and his hated rival (a witch played by Eva Green) having overtaken their place in the community - absolutely anchors a sometimes chaotic and under-written (or is it over-written?) Seth Grahame-Smith screenplay that has too many supporting players running around to little or no effect. Yes, Depp's Barnabas is still ""quirky"" yet the actor retains enough of his aristocratic origins to make the part not just a rehash of the ""colorful"" characters the actor has been essaying of late; he's fascinating, alternately sinister and sympathetic, and the fish-out-of-water material, while not as dominant as the movie's advertising campaign suggested, provides some of the film's more entertaining aspects.The movie does fumble countless dramatic possibilities -- so much of it seems overstuffed and yet undercooked, between Barnabas' weakly drawn relationship with the younger Collins clan (Chloe Grace Moretz's part is close to a throwaway; after prominently establishing her early on, Bella Heathcote's role as the reincarnation of Barnabas' lost love disappears almost completely, resurfacing just in time for the climax), to his confrontation with Green, who turns in an unsatisfying performance (her affected American accent sounds more like she's from Texas as opposed to a witch who's lived in Maine for over two centuries). Michelle Pfeiffer, Jackie Earle Haley, and, of course, Helena Bonham Carter also appear in roles that never seem to serve the dramatic purpose that they should have.It seems evident here that Burton didn't apply himself as much to his craft as usual -- despite using familiar personnel like production designer Rick Henrichs and costume designer Colleen Atwood, the picture has a glossy, ""digitized"" appearance unlike his past works -- and even Danny Elfman's score often takes a backseat to a parade of familiar, effectively utilized period pop tunes. Yet there's just something infectious about ""Dark Shadows"" when it does score -- particularly in several amusing moments of offbeat humor (Barnabas pounding his head against an electric organ; Alice Cooper showing up to perform at a Collins family party) and through Depp's winning performance. Though still one of Burton's weaker outings all told, it's at least livelier than the moribund ""Alice in Wonderland"" and should find a receptive genre audience this Halloween season on video.Warner's Blu-Ray/DVD/Ultraviolet combo pack offers a clear 1080p transfer, with Bruno Delbonnel's cinematography utilizing a striking pallet of colors throughout. The DTS MA soundtrack is effective and extras include just five minutes of deleted scenes (mostly involving Barnabas' relationship with the modern Collins family - material that there should've been more of in the final cut) and ""Maximum Movie Mode"" behind-the-scenes ""focus points.""",3,"Minor Tim Burton -- But Still Fun, With a Great Depp Performance",1348617600,"09 26, 2012",2012,3302,"['Maybe', 'knew', 'remake', 'old', 'Dan', 'Curtis', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'auto-pilot', 'dialed', 'expectations', 'down', 'accordingly', 'Whatever', 'case', 'may', 'be', '2012', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'imperfect', 'surprisingly', 'intermittently', 'charming', 'film', 'how', 'good', 'actor', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'can', 'be.The', 'star', 'performance', 'Barnabas', 'Collins', 'Maine', 'vampire', 'who', 'early', '70s', 'having', 'slept', '200', 'years', 'only', 'find', 'ancestors', 'downturn', 'hated', 'rival', 'witch', 'played', 'Eva', 'Green', 'having', 'overtaken', 'place', 'community', 'absolutely', 'sometimes', 'chaotic', 'under-written', 'over-written', 'Seth', 'Grahame-Smith', 'screenplay', 'too', 'many', 'supporting', 'players', 'running', 'around', 'little', 'effect', 'Yes', 'Depp', 'Barnabas', 'still', 'quirky', 'yet', 'actor', 'aristocratic', 'origins', 'make', 'part', 'not', 'just', 'rehash', 'colorful', 'characters', 'actor', 'been', 'essaying', 'late', 'fascinating', 'alternately', 'sinister', 'sympathetic', 'fish-out-of-water', 'material', 'not', 'as', 'dominant', 'movie', 'advertising', 'campaign', 'suggested', 'film', 'more', 'entertaining', 'aspects.The', 'movie', 'fumble', 'countless', 'dramatic', 'possibilities', 'so', 'much', 'overstuffed', 'yet', 'undercooked', 'Barnabas', 'weakly', 'drawn', 'relationship', 'younger', 'Collins', 'clan', 'Chloe', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'part', 'close', 'throwaway', 'prominently', 'establishing', 'early', 'Bella', 'Heathcote', 'role', 'reincarnation', 'Barnabas', 'lost', 'love', 'almost', 'completely', 'resurfacing', 'just', 'time', 'climax', 'confrontation', 'Green', 'who', 'unsatisfying', 'performance', 'affected', 'American', 'accent', 'more', 'Texas', 'opposed', 'witch', 'who', 'lived', 'Maine', 'two', 'centuries', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'Jackie', 'Earle', 'Haley', 'course', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'also', 'appear', 'roles', 'never', 'seem', 'serve', 'dramatic', 'purpose', 'should', 'have.It', 'evident', 'here', 'Burton', 'did', ""n't"", 'apply', 'as', 'much', 'craft', 'usual', 'using', 'familiar', 'personnel', 'production', 'designer', 'Rick', 'Henrichs', 'costume', 'designer', 'Colleen', 'Atwood', 'picture', 'glossy', 'digitized', 'appearance', 'past', 'works', 'even', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'score', 'often', 'backseat', 'parade', 'familiar', 'effectively', 'utilized', 'period', 'pop', 'tunes', 'just', 'something', 'infectious', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'when', 'score', 'particularly', 'several', 'amusing', 'moments', 'offbeat', 'humor', 'Barnabas', 'pounding', 'head', 'electric', 'organ', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'showing', 'up', 'perform', 'Collins', 'family', 'party', 'Depp', 'winning', 'performance', 'still', 'one', 'Burton', 'weaker', 'outings', 'told', 'least', 'livelier', 'moribund', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'should', 'find', 'receptive', 'genre', 'audience', 'Halloween', 'season', 'video.Warner', 'Blu-Ray/DVD/Ultraviolet', 'combo', 'pack', 'clear', '1080p', 'transfer', 'Bruno', 'Delbonnel', 'cinematography', 'utilizing', 'striking', 'pallet', 'colors', 'DTS', 'MA', 'soundtrack', 'effective', 'extras', 'include', 'just', 'five', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'mostly', 'involving', 'Barnabas', 'relationship', 'modern', 'Collins', 'family', 'material', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'final', 'cut', 'Maximum', 'Movie', 'Mode', 'behind-the-scenes', 'focus', 'points']",N/A

Yet, a couple of plot inconsistencies bothered me... (except, that they were not inconsistencies, but very intentional Burtonisms) SPOILER ALERT!First, why did the ghost of Josette appear to Vicky after Barnabas' arrival?  So, she said he's coming, he did, good!  Ghost, go to the light, but nooo - she kept on appearing and saying ""help me"" and throwing herself off that splendid chandelier over and over again, yet that story line leads nowhere... Vicky doesn't help her in any way and the ghost is nowhere to be seen at the end.Second, why does Vicky walk off the cliff after the witch has died?  The curse should have been lifted, by all fairytale standards; it just doesn't make any sense.  Alas, this is a Tim Burton movie, and the darkness that permeates it is above and beyond anything you should expect from a mediocre Hollywood picture show.It dawned on me - this subtle and, I dare say, dysfunctional, obsession with the macabre and death, that Mr. Burton harbors, has found an interesting way of expressing itself - Josette is telling Vicky to throw herself off the cliff throughout the film in order for Vicky to gain the everlasting union with Barnabas (there is no curse, Vicky jumps of her own volition, is about to die, and just like she planned - he turns her into an immortal, blood sucking monster, weird kissing of the undead ensues).

1470449,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B005LAIHKY,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[7, 9]","Let me start right off the bat by saying that I am a die hard fan of Tim Burton. I will see anything and everything the man does. I think he's a genius. However, even geniuses can have those moments where they aren't knocking it out of the park. 'Dark Shadows' is one of those moments. It has all the right ingredients, but isn't fully stirred to a wonderful brew.Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) is turned into a vampire, cursed by the witch Angelique (Eva Green), and buried. Centuries later, Barnabas is dug up in 1972. Upon returning to his home, Collinwood, he meets the latest Collins family descendants, headed by Michelle Pfeiffer. Barnabas then sets out to return his family, home, and family business to it's former glory, but witch Angelique once again raises her head to cause problems.I never saw the original 'Dark Shadows' TV series or movies, so there is nothing I can say about that and I can't compare. Tim Burton is certainly brilliant when it comes to style and flare, but his recent output has all been just that - style and flare. That's 'Dark Shadows'. It also doesn't help any that the movie has the same cold detachment that his previous movie, ""Alice In Wonderland"", suffered from. Burton has no problem putting together a stellar cast who seem to want to rise to the occassion, but the movie doesn't rise to their level. Depp is fantastic, of course, with a great, classic look. He sparkles in his scenes. The supporting cast of Pfeiffer, Green, Jackie Earle Haley, Chloe Grace Moretz, Helena Bonham Carter, and Christopher Lee, all do their best, but they are in a movie that mostly slumps along not realizing the dazzling people it has to work with. Style-wise, the movie is wonderful, of course. It has some great cinematography, production design, and striking visuals. Sometimes, in some movies, that's enough. But it's not here. Burton can do better.'Dark Shadows' isn't a bad movie by any means. It's certainly watchable, and even enjoyable and entertaining in parts, but it doesn't feel like all the parts are there. That the filmmakers settled for middle of the road. The potential is there in abundance, but no one took too much interest. The final climax is rousing, to be sure, but it felt too quick and not exploited to the the crazy, over the topness that it could of been. A ""Death Becomes Her"" sort of thing, especially with the character of Angelique. That's the feeling throughout the whole movie. That feeling of 'What could of been'.In the end, 'Dark Shadows' is a mixed bag and a lost opportunity. I used to like seeing Tim Burton do his spin of well known, existing properties, but enough is enough. I am really eager for Tim to go back and do something original. Give us the next 'Beetlejuice', the next 'Edward Scissorhands'. Hopefully, the recent ""Frankenweenie"" returns Tim to his former glory. But this one?

After watching ""Dark Shadows"" I guess I will just have to admit that I do like his body of work.

It is really a disgrace they couldn't pull off a good movie.

1470475,A3TY1B54GNRM1B,B005LAIHKY,"B. Newby ""spikescreed""","[5, 7]","My review here is inspired by the myriad opinions being voiced about this movie, opinions which are highly bifurcated. Many people want to defend the movie entirely or lambast it in full with little room in between. I would like to join the vocal minority who believe this movie is neither dark nor light, but a shade of grey.This film does something that few filmmakers in Hollywood would ever dare to do: it attempts to capture the magic of a soap opera, and one that lasted the better part of a decade, in a 2-hour film. This has been attempted before, specifically with Dark Shadows. ""House of Dark Shadows"" worked at the time, and still feels good for long-time fans of the series, but newcomers are often left feeling that they missed something. They did - the entire rest of the series. A good soap opera never has just one plot - it has many which arch over multiple episodes/seasons, or wrap around each other, or come and go...it is maddening to try and follow. To boil down the essence of a series like that into a single film is a ludicrous task. But they did it, and good for them for trying. It is ambitious, and I respect that.Going into ""Dark Shadows,"" one needs to keep this in mind: Burton and crew attempted to take the most popular story arc from the series, Barnabas's curse and his feud with Angelique, and distill it into a stand-alone plot. But, being who they are, the filmmakers could not ignore the source material entirely. What we end up with is a solid plot which is constantly interrupted by smaller, less poignant plots which are related to the main plot (though some are more related than others). That is exactly what the series did, only it did it over the course of years, not a couple hours. Having watched the series, I know that there are some subplots worth skipping. This movie felt the same way - I really liked the main plot but I could have done without some of the sidebars.All this makes the film hard to swallow for viewers. Some viewers wanted a film slavishly devoted to the source material and others wanted a pure-bred Burton horror/comedy. What we all got was something in between. When this movie gets dark, it gets dark. When it gets goofy, it gets goofy. These two halves don't exactly blend together, and instead we get an oil/water effect - they never blend into the perfect mixture but neither does one detract from the other. They just sort of coexist together. Some people want the movie to pick a side: either be a pure comedy (which would have felt insulting to the source material and its fans) or a pure horror (which runs the risk of taking its dark side too seriously the way ""Dark Shadows: The Revival"" did). What we should do is take it for what it is. You may not like everything about it, but maybe you'll like more than you expected.Confused yet? Yeah, sorry, but this is a weird movie to describe while remaining neutral. And be sure, I am neutral. I didn't hate this movie like I thought I would, but neither am I willing to run out and pay $20 for a new copy. I'm going to wait for the price to drop, then I'll consider it.Would I recommend this movie? Yes, but only to open-minded DS fans, Burton fans, and the occasional horror/comedy fan. I don't think most people will feel connected to this story, but maybe they will connect with just enough of it to see it as an acceptable popcorn flick. If you feel like you want to give it a chance, do so. Otherwise, leave it alone and find something else. It isn't a movie to watch unless you really feel like you should.On a side note, my mother was a die-hard fan of the show back in the 60s. I took her to see this movie opening weekend and she really liked it, more so than I did. She took it for what it was and said to me afterwards, ""It was like watching a miniature series, like I just watched an entire season in one sitting. I hope they make a sequel."" And she dislikes everything Burton or Depp does. Take that evidence for what you will. I know other die-hard fans who despised it.

Barnabus, Quentin, Victoria, et al.

It gave the film too much temptation to bring out elements of Jack Sparrow, and this movie didn't need that.Another problem I had with the film is that after Barnabus appears in the 70s and ""reunites"" with Victoria, she suddenly disappears for an extended stretch of the film. By the time they come back to the romance, there is literally no foundation built for it.Despite flaws, the film does have a lot of good moments. Special effects are outstanding and often spooky, as you would hope they would be. The funny moments are indeed funny ... there should have just been either more of them or none at all. The climax of the film is unusual and disturbing, even if it doesn't really make much sense or leave you with a real feeling of resolution.Obviously, huge fans of Depp are going to purchase this film. For anyone else, I recommend catching it on cable or a modestly priced rental. While I thought the film was worth a look, it isn't one I'll care to watch a second time.",3,"Several good sequences, but left me flat",1365552000,"04 10, 2013",2013,1650,"[""'m"", 'old', 'enough', 'have', 'watched', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'originally', 'when', 'ran', '30', 'minute', 'daily', 'soap', 'was', 'well', 'informed', 'original', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'lore', 'Barnabus', 'Quentin', 'Victoria', 'et', 'al', 'previews', 'expected', 'was', 'going', 'deviate', 'serious', 'nature', 'original', 'material', 'campy', 'story', 'plenty', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'patented', 'offbeat', 'character.I', 'think', 'creators', 'film', 'never', 'made', 'up', 'mind', 'what', 'kind', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'scenes', 'Depp', 'played', 'amusing', 'fish', 'water', 'then', 'next', 'scene', 'committing', 'cold-blooded', 'murder', 'Depp', 'think', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'wrong', 'choice', 'role', 'gave', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'temptation', 'bring', 'out', 'elements', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'that.Another', 'problem', 'had', 'film', 'Barnabus', '70s', 'reunites', 'Victoria', 'suddenly', 'extended', 'stretch', 'film', 'time', 'come', 'back', 'romance', 'literally', 'foundation', 'built', 'it.Despite', 'flaws', 'film', 'have', 'lot', 'good', 'moments', 'Special', 'effects', 'are', 'outstanding', 'often', 'spooky', 'would', 'hope', 'would', 'be', 'funny', 'moments', 'are', 'indeed', 'funny', 'there', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'either', 'more', 'none', 'climax', 'film', 'unusual', 'disturbing', 'even', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'leave', 'real', 'feeling', 'resolution.Obviously', 'huge', 'fans', 'Depp', 'are', 'going', 'purchase', 'film', 'anyone', 'else', 'recommend', 'catching', 'cable', 'modestly', 'priced', 'rental', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'look', ""n't"", 'one', ""'ll"", 'care', 'watch', 'second', 'time']",N/A

Even if that heart is no longer beating,"" might be the theme of this very funny film by Tim Burton.I used to watch the original series on TV when I was a kid.  And I was hooked, especially when the Barnabas Collins character was introduced.  I tried to watch this series again recently when streaming for it became available, and realized that in reality, the series itself wasn't all that great.  It wasn't really scary enough, and it wasn't really campy enough.  The mistake that they made with the series:  they needed to go one way or the other and they tried to have it both ways, and I believe that it succeeded ultimately at neither.But Mr. Burton didn't make that mistake.  He decided to mostly take the campy route, and in my opinion, it works.  The spirit of the early 70s was recreated here as well, so that worked.  And the overall acting was very good as well, particularly by Johnny Depp and his nemesis.  But I believe that the writing was the strongest point in this film, since movies such as ""Dark Shadows"" either succeed or fail based upon writing.  Comedic timing by the actors is also important, and I believe that the actors succeeded in that regard.  In particular, there is a scene where an entire Carpenters song is played that is very clever and funny, especially if you're a fan of that excellent group that disbanded too young.One other item that worked as well:  the special effects.  There is a lot of CGI here, and in a lot of films, the CGI just isn't quite believable.  In ""Shadows,"" differentiating between what is fantasy and what is real is difficult, which is quite a feat.Pretty big recommendation by me for a film that the critics panned, for some odd reason.

The film is a nice blend of comedy and horror; however the horror might be better described as dark humor. Tim Burton is a visual genius and his films are eye stunners. Based on the old television soap opera, Dark Shadows has visual effects that would be the envy of those involved in the television version back in 1968. Interestingly, Depp is not sexy in this film. He is stiff and creepy but he never emits sexual vibes. His make-up, including the greasy black hair that encircles his white face, is just creepy, never sexy.The character of Angelique, the white witch seeking revenge for being rejected by Barnabas Collins 250 years ago. When Barnabas is finally released from his tomb after 200 years of entrapment, Angelique continues her revenge against the Collins family. In the final fight between Angelique and the Collins family, I actually found the wood-work carving and architectural details coming to life as a visual treat. Eva Green actually out-acts the rest of the cast in this film.Whereas the visuals are entertaining, the plot is a bit weak and is not really related that much to the original television series that I watched as a kid.

1470518,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B005LAIHKY,Chris Kennison,"[24, 33]","Tim Burton has made a career off of the `strange and unusual'. In fact, he has rarely strayed from that formula in his entire career. He has made gems like ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Beetlejuice"", ""Batman"", ""The Nightmare before Christmas"", ""Corpse Bride"", ""Ed Wood"", ""Sweeney Todd"", and the list goes on and on. He has also teamed up with Johnny Depp now eight times.  With ""Dark Shadows"" he has kept with the `strange and unusual' theme, but the strangest thing about it, is the lack of comedy in the film, despite the trailers obvious comedic tone.I wasn't sure what to think about ""Dark Shadows"". I have been a huge fan of Tim Burton over the years, but the trailer promoting the film just didn't grab me as funny. I felt like the trailer was trying to be funny, and I found it `strange' and flat. I know now, after watching the film, that my perception and preconceived notion was the correct one.For all I know, the film will enjoy the same camp following as the television show in which it is based upon. In 1966, the television show ""Dark Shadows"" debuted on ABC and it was melodramatic, campy and `strange'. The television show was a gothic soap opera and that is exactly what the film is. It centers around Barnabas Collins, a man who unfortunately draws the intense eye of a hired help named Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green). He doesn't return her affections and when he falls in love with another. Bouchard, a witch, casts spells that change all of their lives forever.The film has amazing effects and design. Most Burton films do. I was most drawn by the amazing effect they had for the witch as she cracks from time to time like a porcelain doll. It was an amazing effect, and it isn't the only one. The thing about ""Dark Shadows"" is that it could have been great. It had the potential to be great, but there were just too many scenes that served no purpose in the film, except to try and be funny and most weren't. The movie jumped from drama to comedy without warning and it never tapped into a single emotion the whole time.I wanted to like it. That's the thing.

So, as you might expect, when I heard about the upcoming release for the theatrical version of Dark Shadows, I was curious to see what the film treatment for this TV classic would be like.In general, what I thought I would get from this movie was a light-hearted take on the TV show and I was okay with that.  I say this because the ""spooky, horror"" genre just doesn't appeal to me like it did when I was a kid.  In watching the trailers for this film, I was led to believe that I would actually be watching a satire of a TV classic with some updates added to make it a bit more contemporary.  What I think I saw was a film in which the direction it wanted to take (remake, satire,comedy, or horror) was not evidently clear and I thus felt cheated after spending about two hours watching a film which fell far short of expectations.The story line for the film seemed to change mid-course and seemed fragmented in these transitions.  Some parts also seemed too predictable to keep me interested.  Granted, I did have a few chuckles at a couple of points in the film.  However, those laughs were not worth the nearly two hours of agony I spent hoping the story would get more interesting and thus better.The experience of watching Dark Shadows left me with the belief that all of the interesting parts of the movie were shown in the TV commercials for the film.

That should have already told me that this is not going to be anything like the original Dark Shadow.  Sometimes, I got the impression that Tim Burton could not make up his mind.  Is this a comedy or a horror show?All this tragedy, all this suffering, came about because a young Barnabas spurned the love of the family maid, Angelique.  Unfortunately for Barnabas, Angelique is unlike most women.  Most women who get spurned simply just suck it up, get depressed, and write poems about it.  But not Angelique.  Angelique knows witchcraft!  She puts together a curse to strike at Barnabas, turning him into a vampire.  Unable to control his urge to suck the life blood from humans, Barnabas eventually gets imprisoned and buried away.  The people of Collinsport eventually got tired of his dining habits, marches up to Collinwood and takes Barnabas into custody.  Driven by Angelique, they imprison Barnabas into a special coffin and buried him deep under ground.  Time marched on and eventually these events were forgotten.Now, fast forward two hundred years into the future, to the year 1972.  Construction workers accidentally release Barnabas from his coffin.  Still alive, the vampire wakes up from his sleep of two centuries.  Immediately, he makes his way back to Collinwood, and finds the once-glorious mansion in a state of decay and disrepair.  The family fortune has turned for the worse, it would seem.  Barnabas introduces himself to the now dysfunctional Collins family and learns that the once thriving Collins caning plant has been struggling to stay in business. To complicate matters, Barnabas must now learn to adapt to the modern world.  Nevertheless, Barnabas makes a vow to his new family that he will bring the family business back to its former glory, and with it, the family finances. Angelique is still alive, naturally.  And now owns the biggest business in town.This is actually a pretty good movie.  I'm just not a big fan of Tim Burton's ideas.  I much prefer the Dark Shadows revival of the early 1990s.  Anyway, I do agree with the comedic and light-hearted treatment of the material.  With all of the vampire movies out there (Twilight, True Blood, Underworld, Blade), the last thing Hollywood needed was another stereotypical vampire flick.  So, perhaps this may not have been the right moment to bring out another vampire film.  And if you must do so, you have to be a little different.  And this one certainly is.  Vampires are a dime a dozen in cinema today.  Perhaps Dan Curtis' vision would have been met with lukewarm reception, given the number of vampire exposure on both the big screen and television.  Tim Burton probably felt like he needed to take his movie in another direction.  Given that there were other vampire-themed movies to come out in 2012, from the outlandish ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" to the latest in the ""Twilight"" franchise, it may have been the right thing to do.Johnny Depp is actually very good as Barnabas.  Eva Green and Michelle Pfeifer were pretty good in their respective roles.  In my view, Chloe Grace Moretz should have been given better material to work with.  She was wasted in this film.

1470533,A24F1UX8ZT5IXY,B005LAIHKY,C.J. Hustwick,"[0, 0]","Are they just spitballing here?  Dark Shadows should be a thoroughly enjoyable entertainment featuring an ensemble cast and the wicked environs of Collinwood, Maine.  It could have been one of the few really enjoyable American films of the past few years, as one of our most prolific directors returns to the sub-genre he essentially created.  Instead, once again we have a DOA script loaded with nothing more than a string of tired fish-out-of-water jokes and caricatures, creepy mansions peopled by increasingly uninteresting &#8220;eccentrics&#8221;.How did we journey from the brilliant fable of Edward Scissorhands to this? It almost begs the question if this spells the death of the distinctly 1990s pop-gothic aesthetic which Burton pioneered.  Sleepy Hollow, Corpse Bride, and Sweeney Todd all had their problems, but Dark Shadows is by far the most regressive of the bunch, particularly as it should have been a triumphant return to form for a director who&#8217;s been all over the map.  This is where we see the depth of the sell-out who unleashed &#8220;Alice in Wonderland&#8221; into theatres worldwide.The story follows the British TV show of the same name whereby a 200-year-old vampire comes back to life and lives in the 20th Century, vengeful and seeking out true love &#8212; at least I think that&#8217;s the story.  Funny things are then supposed to then happen &#8212; but they mostly don&#8217;t.  For the first act the film seems confused as to who the main character is, and when Barnabus does show up he promptly murders eleven innocent men.  Then he murders some more, we find out he&#8217;s rich, and the dysfunctional family pulls together for a limp climax.  That&#8217;s about it.  Eva Green from &#8220;Casino Royale&#8221; pretty much steals the show as the wafer-thin villain, and while Johnny Depp fans will be intermittently amused, poor Michelle Pfeiffer isn&#8217;t given much to work with, and she&#8217;s never been the greatest comic anyhow (just see her turn as Selena Kyle in Batman Returns for a fine example).  The less said about Helena Bonham Carter the better.What little pleasure there is to be had comes mostly from production designer Rick Heinrichs, who also worked on Batman Returns, Sleepy Hollow, and the megabudget Pirates of the Caribbean films.  While there&#8217;s a funny McDonald&#8217;s joke, and some amusing purple prose spewed from Barnabus&#8217;s lips, the fact that this is a &#8220;Time Burton Movie&#8221; is supposed to be enough.

1470539,A1LBGXE29GG1IR,B005LAIHKY,"Coffee Addicted Writer's Reviews ""Billy""","[2, 2]","The film starts in the year 1760, where the Collins along with their young son Barnabas leave Liverpool and travel to the United States, where they open up a fishing port in Maine. Years go by and Barnabas (Johnny Depp) grows up to be somewhat of a playboy, fooling around a servant, Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green), who is actually a powerful witch. Barnabas falls in love with Josette du Pres and rejects Angelique's affections, but the witch doesn't like rejection. She forces Josette to jump off a cliff, and one by one the Collins die. All but Barnabas as Angelique has cursed him into a vampire. When the town people find out about the vampire, they chain Barnabas inside a coffin and bury him.It's now 1972 and a young woman named Maggie Evans is arriving at the Collinwood Manor. She is running away from her haunting past and uses the name Victoria Winters as she accepts the job as David Collin's governess.A group of construction works stumble upon a coffin and releases the vampire Barnabas Collins, who returns to the Collinwood Manor where he meets the handyman Willie Loomis and makes him his servant. Barnabas introduces himself to the family as a distant cousin, but he does not fool the head of the household, Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (played by Michelle Pfeiffer). With no other choice, he unveils himself as their ancestor and now a cursed vampire. He wants to be a member of the family and help restore the Collins canning business, which has went under because of a competitor, Angel Bay Fishery.Barnabas is stunned when he sees Victoria Winters as she is the split image of his long lost love Josette. He is determined to romance the young governess. The Collins doctor, who lives with them, Dr. Hoffman easily figures out that Barnabas is a vampire, and insists that she can find a cure for the curse. Out his control, Barnabas is charming to all women and Dr. Hoffman falls in love with him.After restoring Collinwood and the canning business, Barnabas learns that Angel Bay Fishery is owned by Angelique, who has been trying to end the Collins family line for years. She still loves Barnabas, but he still does not return her affections. Therefore, Angelique plans on destroying Barnabas and the rest of the Collins.I went into this movie fully aware that this was a Tim Burton movie; therefore I was probably going to get a gothic comedy, in which I did. A die hard Dark Shadows fan will be disappointed that their favorite Gothic drama is now a comedy, but I watched the movie for what it was, a silly Gothic tale. The sets and the costumes look amazing. I thought Eve Green was miscast. Don't get me wrong, she is a great actress and she looks the part of Angelique, but I never felt that she was truly evil. Michelle Pfeiffer looks great for her age and she does a marvelous job playing Elizabeth. Jackie Earle Haley was the best actor in this remake, putting a new spin on Willie Loomis. Johnny Depp is goofy all the way through the movie, and looks less like the 60's Barnabas and more like an old-school vampire. Even though Barnabas is a murderer, Depp made the character funny and likeable. Now I did have some issues with Helena Bonham Carter portrayal of Dr. Hoffman, who is now a lonely drunk. I felt she was never in character and was just there to be there.The screenplay writer Seth Grahame-Smith threw in all the Dark Shadows best with a vampire, a witch, a werewolf, and ghosts. I was disappointed that Quentin never made an appearance, but I guess that was why another Collins was a werewolf, which added nothing to the plot. I liked the small ghost storyline and the CGI special effects never bothered me. I am not for sure why Seth and Tim decided to mold Maggie Evans and Victoria Winters into one character, but it didn't bother me one bit.Dark Shadows is somewhat underrated as I did enjoy the movie for what it was, a fun Gothic romp.",3,Tim Burton's Dark Shadows,1345593600,"08 22, 2012",2012,3885,"['film', 'year', '1760', 'where', 'Collins', 'young', 'son', 'Barnabas', 'leave', 'Liverpool', 'travel', 'United', 'States', 'where', 'open', 'up', 'fishing', 'port', 'Maine', 'Years', 'go', 'Barnabas', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'up', 'be', 'somewhat', 'playboy', 'fooling', 'servant', 'Angelique', 'Bouchard', 'Eva', 'Green', 'who', 'actually', 'powerful', 'witch', 'Barnabas', 'love', 'Josette', 'du', 'Pres', 'Angelique', 'affections', 'witch', ""n't"", 'like', 'rejection', 'Josette', 'jump', 'off', 'cliff', 'one', 'one', 'Collins', 'die', 'Barnabas', 'Angelique', 'cursed', 'vampire', 'When', 'town', 'people', 'find', 'out', 'vampire', 'chain', 'Barnabas', 'coffin', 'bury', 'him.It', 'now', '1972', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Maggie', 'Evans', 'arriving', 'Collinwood', 'Manor', 'running', 'away', 'haunting', 'past', 'name', 'Victoria', 'Winters', 'job', 'David', 'Collin', 'governess.A', 'group', 'construction', 'stumble', 'coffin', 'vampire', 'Barnabas', 'Collins', 'who', 'Collinwood', 'Manor', 'where', 'handyman', 'Willie', 'Loomis', 'servant', 'Barnabas', 'family', 'distant', 'cousin', 'not', 'fool', 'head', 'household', 'Elizabeth', 'Collins', 'Stoddard', 'played', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'other', 'choice', 'ancestor', 'now', 'cursed', 'vampire', 'be', 'member', 'family', 'help', 'restore', 'Collins', 'canning', 'business', 'went', 'competitor', 'Angel', 'Bay', 'Fishery.Barnabas', 'stunned', 'when', 'Victoria', 'Winters', 'split', 'image', 'long', 'lost', 'love', 'Josette', 'determined', 'romance', 'young', 'governess', 'Collins', 'doctor', 'who', 'Dr.', 'Hoffman', 'easily', 'out', 'Barnabas', 'vampire', 'can', 'find', 'cure', 'curse', 'control', 'Barnabas', 'charming', 'women', 'Dr.', 'Hoffman', 'love', 'him.After', 'restoring', 'Collinwood', 'canning', 'business', 'Barnabas', 'Angel', 'Bay', 'Fishery', 'owned', 'Angelique', 'who', 'been', 'trying', 'end', 'Collins', 'family', 'line', 'years', 'still', 'Barnabas', 'still', 'not', 'return', 'affections', 'Therefore', 'Angelique', 'destroying', 'Barnabas', 'rest', 'Collins.I', 'went', 'movie', 'fully', 'aware', 'was', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'movie', 'therefore', 'was', 'probably', 'going', 'get', 'gothic', 'comedy', 'did', 'die', 'hard', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'fan', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'favorite', 'Gothic', 'drama', 'now', 'comedy', 'watched', 'movie', 'what', 'was', 'silly', 'Gothic', 'tale', 'sets', 'costumes', 'look', 'amazing', 'thought', 'Eve', 'Green', 'was', 'miscast', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'great', 'actress', 'part', 'Angelique', 'never', 'felt', 'was', 'truly', 'evil', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'great', 'age', 'marvelous', 'job', 'playing', 'Elizabeth', 'Jackie', 'Earle', 'Haley', 'was', 'best', 'actor', 'remake', 'putting', 'new', 'spin', 'Willie', 'Loomis', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'goofy', 'way', 'movie', 'less', '60', 'Barnabas', 'more', 'old-school', 'vampire', 'Even', 'Barnabas', 'murderer', 'Depp', 'made', 'character', 'funny', 'likeable', 'Now', 'did', 'have', 'issues', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'portrayal', 'Dr.', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'now', 'lonely', 'drunk', 'felt', 'was', 'never', 'character', 'was', 'just', 'there', 'be', 'there.The', 'screenplay', 'writer', 'Seth', 'Grahame-Smith', 'threw', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'best', 'vampire', 'witch', 'werewolf', 'ghosts', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Quentin', 'never', 'made', 'appearance', 'guess', 'was', 'why', 'Collins', 'was', 'werewolf', 'added', 'nothing', 'plot', 'liked', 'small', 'ghost', 'storyline', 'CGI', 'special', 'effects', 'never', 'bothered', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'Seth', 'Tim', 'decided', 'mold', 'Maggie', 'Evans', 'Victoria', 'Winters', 'one', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'one', 'bit.Dark', 'Shadows', 'somewhat', 'underrated', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'what', 'was', 'fun', 'Gothic', 'romp']",N/A

1470544,A2XK9W52YI1HQR,B005LAIHKY,Craig Gustafson,"[10, 13]","One of the reasons that ""Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein"" and ""Young Frankenstein"" are perfect horror comedies is because they each have a consistent tone.  ""Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein"" plays as both a standard Abbott & Costello comedy and a standard Universal horror film.  Bud & Lou play for laughs and the monsters play it straight.  The only exception is when Frankenstein's Monster recoils in horror when seeing Costello for the first time.  ""Young Frankenstein"" examines all the clich&eacute;s of old ""Frankenstein"" movies, but the characters are always deadly serious.On the other hand, I've been listening to a lot of old time radio comedy shows featuring horror stars like Boris Karloff and Peter Lorre.  Some are really good (""Bob Hope"", ""Abbott & Costello""), but most of them (""Dinah Shore"", ""Command Performance"") are painful, because they are written by hacks with no love for the genre, who trot out the same references and puns every time.  They'd be unbearable if it wasn't for the gravitas brought by the stars - Peter Lorre, in particular, could make any line funny.""Dark Shadows"" plays as if a team of writers from the ""Dinah Shore Show"" were assigned to write a straight horror movie and couldn't resist the impulse to Get a Few Boffos!  This could have been *such* a good movie, and it's just crap.  It just has no idea what kind of film it wants to be, and the mix it tries for just doesn't mix.  Barnabas Collins emerges from his coffin after 196 years and he's *really thirsty*, killing eleven construction workers luckless enough to have dug up his grave.  Then he does a lame gag with a McDonald's sign.  He brushes his teeth while looking into a mirror which doesn't reflect him.  He sleeps hanging upside down like a bat.There are some chilling moments, as when Barnabas sadly announces to a group of hippies with whom he has been pleasantly (if inanely) conversing, that he will now have to kill all of them.  Which he does.  It wants to be a straight horror film.  It wants to be a fish-out-of-water comedy.  And it has NO clue how to put the two together.Burton also steals the brilliant sex-so-hot-it-trashes-the-bedroom scene from ""The Tall Guy"", where Jeff Goldblum and Emma Thompson hilariously wrecked an entire room without the benefit of harnesses and stunt people.  It's not funny here.Johnny Depp does what he can with the material.  For this picture, rather than channeling Michael Jackson, he's 100% doing Richard Burton as a vampire.Eva Green is really good as Angelique, though unlike Lara Parker, her eyes are not her most prominent features.Jackie Earle Haley is good as Willie Loomis, totally played for laughs rather than as John Karlen's angsty, guilt-ridden dweeb.I love Helena Bonham Carter in most things, and here she's a redhead, so you're not going to catch me saying she's being anything less than magnificent.Everbody else was ok.  Eh.Original series stars Jonathan Frid, Kathryn Leigh Scott, Lara Parker and David Selby appear in the ball sequence - for four seconds.I'm a huge fan of the original series.  I had high hopes because Tim Burton and Johnny Depp kept loudly proclaiming that THEY were fans of the original series.  As a straight vampire film with great characters and solid acting, this is a bust.  As an episode of ""The Birds-Eye Open House with Dinah Shore"", it's serviceable.

1470546,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B005LAIHKY,C. Sawin,"[6, 8]","I think most people can agree that Tim Burton movies have gone downhill in recent years, but I think I tend to enjoy them a bit more than everyone else. While ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" fail in comparison to the likes of ""Beetlejuice"", ""Edward Scissorhands"", and ""Sleepy Hollow"", they're still pretty entertaining at face value. ""Dark Shadows"" has been rubbing everyone the wrong way ever since that first trailer was released and revealed that the original gothic soap opera from 1966 was now more of a comedic fantasy. Even after viewing the movie, giving a definite opinion of ""Dark Shadows"" is still rather difficult.I didn't follow the original series, but I had my doubts about the movie right from the start. Johnny Depp looked really awkward as Barnabas Collins. If you just look at Barnabas, he appears to be an emo Nosferatu. The comedy felt like it didn't belong in a film like this. It was as if Dracula went to the school of slapstick comedy and decided to run around throwing cream pies and squirting everyone in the face with a seltzer water bottle instead of biting them on the neck and either feasting on their blood or turning them into a creature of the night.""Dark Shadows"" is somewhat surprising though. Witnessing the whole McDonalds sponsorship scene was a bit painful, but that scene that takes place where Barnabas awakens in 1972 is when the movie illustrates that it is capable of getting dark and violent. Hell, it may even show a little blood every once in awhile. The humor is very ridiculous throughout, but there are quite a few innuendos and a handful of sex jokes that you may not be expecting. There's an entire conversation revolving around balls, a scene where Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter) goes down on Barnabas, a pair of panties being shoved and left in Barnabas' face for an extended period of time, and one of the most awkward sex scenes to be released on the big screen that is even more ""regrettable"" than Barnabas says it is.Most of the humor that hits its mark the most involves the outdated speaking method that Barnabas uses. His fascination with ""fertile birthing hips,"" the way he keeps referring to Alice Cooper as a hideous woman, and his fantastically longwinded insults are easily the highlight of the character. Chloe Grace Moretz is fairly entertaining, as well. That could just be because she reminds me of my cousin who wishes she was born in the seventies, but her screen time certainly didn't feel like it was wasted.""Dark Shadows"" is this really bizarre excuse of a movie. Some moments are pretty funny and others are fairly clever, but that's where the movie's charm ends. Everything is overly goofy, ridiculous, and too over the top to be completely coherent. Imagine trying to mix a fruit salad and a garden salad. That weird concoction is pretty much what ""Dark Shadows"" is to the film world. The fantastical comedy isn't really good or downright awful, but you can't really describe it as anything other than ""meh.""

1470568,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B005LAIHKY,David Baldwin,"[1, 2]","The original ""Dark Shadows"" serial went off the air when I was eight so I have vague recall.  I remember my older sister going out for Halloween as Angelique one year.  As a Burton-Depp fan I was awaiting this version with baited breath.  A couple months before the film came out the devotees of the series went on the offensive imploring people not to see it because Burton et al made a ""comedy"".  My buddy, who was a long time fan and even liked the Ben Cross reboot, hated the film.  These dual forces persuaded me not to see it in a theatre and apparently others followed suit because it was a box office underperformer.  Finally seeing the film on home video I can state emphatically to the fanboys, ""Are you mad?  Have you even seen the movie?""  ""Dark Shadows"" is terrific.  For those who say that Burton made a comedy for sure there are comedic elements but for the most part the narrative is played straight.  Johnny Depp continues to amaze with his mesmerizing account of reluctant vampire Barnabas Collins.  Clad in black with a pale visage Depp projects an austere courtliness even if his underlying motive is to drink your blood.  Eva Green is equally terrific as the devilish Angelique, a seductive witch who could tempt the purest of heart to the dark side.  The script is full of wit and memorably macabre throwaway lines.  The art direction is nothing short of stupendous.  Aside from Danny Elfman's usual sterling score Burton populates the soundtrack with some delicious vintage chestnuts.  I had chills running down my spine as a straightjacketed Alice Cooper sang ""The Ballad of Dwight Fry"" at a Collins family ball.  Afficienadoes of the original series may quibble with some of the liberties Burton has taken.  As one of the uninitiated I thought it was a gas.  If anything came out of this I bought ""House of Dark Shadows"" and ""Night of Dark Shadows"" because Burton's film piqued my interest in Dan Curtis' original creation.",5,"Take A Chill Pill,Fanboys.

Yes, I'm 53 & not a prude at all. I just think some shows can go a bit overboard. HBO was not like it is today, yet even regular TV shows more than what I'm use to. I agree, times changed but perhaps the simpler times can be more refreshing too. Leave something to the viewer's imagination. I like the Underworld series & the scenes where Sonia is with Lucien & Selene is with Michael are lovely. They are making love which is how is should be.This Dark Shadows, as I stated above was great! It had some sex not being graphic, no graphic violence & comedy. There is so much horror going on in the real world I prefer to laugh when I'm relaxing. Do like horror flicks as long as they aren't too graphic.

It had its moments but was basically over-acted, low budget and full of fluff.It shows the utter desperation of Hollywood that anyone would consider this show to be worthy of a reboot.  The film most horrific moment is when you realize that you've just wasted almost two hours of your life that you will never get back.This film has NOTHING going for it.  Johnny Depp overwhelms the entire cast who seem to be little more than ghosts in their roles.  This point is especially clear when you realize that the great romance of this film revolves around Barnaby (Johnny Depp) and the governess who has about three minutes of screen time.  At the end of the film, we are supposed to feel something for this tragic couple but I'm not sure why.The plot is so pointless that the viewer is subjected to good chunks of time when nothing but mayhem is going on.  I don't mean anything exciting just things getting broken, burning, flying around - whatever.The antagonist is about the only character who has any fire to her.

1470603,A1EZMV5DSWU8TU,B005LAIHKY,Draconis Blackthorne,"[0, 3]","Uncustomarily compelled to emerge from My Noctuary Lair to attend the external theatre experience, I recently viewed this presentation for the amusement of it, actually not expecting too much by way of factual or actual content, usually preferring one's own viewing room, or the drive-in for these purposes. Yet harboring a deep affinity for the series, and being appreciative of the productions of Tim Burton {especially in combination with Maestro Danny Elfman's orchestrations}, it seemed a natural inspection. He does have a knack for splendidly presenting the Gothic sensibility to a fine point, after all.I first became pleasantly aware of this sinister series through rebroadcasts on a local channel, and has since become preferred entertainment fare, which is presented in a serious vain, whose Gothic psychodramas seem to reflect many predispositions and innate interests. The uses of mood lighting, suspenseful music, occult story lines, grants it a brooding atmosphere similar to Hammer films, yet imbued with Dan Curtis' unique psychological darkness. Dark Shadows features not only vampires & witches, but warlocks, werewolves, zombies, ghosts, sinister cults, insane preachers, time-travels, mad killers, demons, & many more creatures & situations of a paranormal nature.As far as Dark Shadows films are concerned, I personally recommendHouse of Dark Shadows&Night Of Dark Shadows.So, when I first viewed the preview for the film, it was a bit underwhelming, as it focuses primarily on the 70's comedic elements, yet in the overall film, it actually became beside the point. Actually, I thought it a bit appropriate after all, that since the series was broadcast in the late 60's/early 70's season {actually premiering in Year 1 A.S.}, that the setting seemed to make sense for a plot such as this. Being leery of any 'remakes, since the early 90's adaptation was actually a pleasing tribute, but what may be condensed in a 113 minute film? Obviously, if you want the real thing, just continue viewing and submerging yourself therein. I have been collecting these on DVD as they became available, & most remarkably, the entire series has recently become available in the marvelousDark Shadows: The Complete Original Series (Deluxe Edition).In October of VII A.S., Barnabas Collins is unleashed from a century of subterranean incarceration by construction workmen {instead of groundskeeper Willy Loomis immediately, whom he meets shortly}, who of course, sates his blood lust forthwith. He meets a drunken Willy {his 'Renfield'} wandering the Collinswood grounds among the pumpkins, who after a quick interrogation about the current surroundings, quickly assumes his role.Arriving at the Collinswood estate, he meets with elegant matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard and the rest of the surviving family. She is obviously taken aback by his arrival {return}, thus revealing some interesting house secrets during the introduction. After all, a pleasantly dark chamber via a secret passageway is a necessity for any vampire! His descriptions of the architecture and history of the fine resident possessions therein are a remarkable relation, in marked appreciation for the construction of their materialization.Present are Elizabeth {the lovely, stately, lady of the manor}, Dr. Hoffman {here, the professional intellectual physician is portrayed as an attractive, fiery-haired lush living a life of quiet desperation}, David {well-portrayed, rather like a Damien}, pretty little Carolyn Stoddard {the impetuous blonde here portrayed as a hippie-like stoner / rebellious 'party girl' type}, & Roger Collins {the stoic gentleman here portrayed as a rude, inconstant, boorish lothario}. While Barnabas himself is here portrayed in a more slender variation, more akin to a callowNosferatu, intentionally depicted.With the help of these new-found relatives, Barnabas goes about familiarizing himself with the culture, to some amusing interactions with automobiles, entertainment evolutions, & technological advancements. The juxtaposition between a gentleman of eloquence, fine tastes, irrefutable deportment, dashing style, and elite dispositions, to that of an increasingly vulgar, down-slidden society are tangibly evident.Arriving as David's new nanny, Barnabas is smitten with Victoria Winters, seemingly Josette resurrected, who, in another fanciful twist among many, here arrives in Collinwood from that fateful train ride deriving from no less than an asylum. Most amusingly intriguing indeed.He eventually becomes re-acquainted with a busty Angelique Bouchard, the source of his torments, for those unfamiliar, in what would amount to be an undead fatal attraction, the witch who commended him into the coffin-prison for refuting her advances in favor of his dear Josette DuPres {a sweetly diminutive fianc&eacute;}, who herself plunged from Widow's Hill at the bidding of black witchcraft. Harboring resentment of Barnabas & the successes of The Collins Family since childhood, Angelique uses her own immortality & wiles to raise her family name to prominence. Of course, that re-acquaintance yields a passionate fling finally culminating in a final battle.Notable scenes include: one Alice Cooper performing at a ball circaWelcome to My Nightmare, with Jonathan Frid, Lara Parker, David Selby and Kathryn Leigh Scott in attendance. ""David! Go watch the Cooper woman!""; a haggard Christopher Lee as Clarney the fisherman hypnotized by Barnabas; Barnabas lays some hippies to waste while camping in the forest.As pleasurably typical of Tim Burton productions, the sets are a majestic marvel to behold, the music enriching with an inspired soundtrack by Danny Elfman, familiar & compelling characterizations, complimenting the overall experience. In this case, this rendition is an amusing aside, created as a quirky notion of how a vampire would interact with an outside herd world, in continued predation, of course. As a combination Gothic / Comedy / Thriller, it certainly has its moments in the shadows, even while venturing into the lightmare, and may certainly be good for a nefarious cachinnation or two, while asserting an enhanced appreciation for the core origins.

It suffers from a severe case of subplot-itis, and tries in vain to cram four chapters' worth of back story into nearly every face. Even the less interesting minor players are obsessively over-inspected, which leads the more important characters to pull constant disappearing acts. Pseudo-protagonist Belle Heathcote is the most glaring example, vanishing without explanation for a full forty minutes during the second act, and then materializing right in the middle of a cramped romance. Johnny Depp's Barnabus is the one constant, happily sailing far over the top in yet another colorful, inexplicably successful leading turn. I caught myself laughing at the punchlines more often than I'd expected, but Dark Shadows often tests the boundaries of good taste, and in one case (an out-of-left-field comic love scene) ventures too close to the uncomfortably absurd.

""Planet of the Apes.""And for many years, he and favorite star Johnny Depp wanted to make an adaptation of the classic supernatural soap ""Dark Shadows."" Except, you know, getting virtually every aspect of the story wrong -- instead of a tale of vampiric tragedy and suspense, we get an awful sitcom that tries to get all its humor from Barnabas Collins being a ""man out of time.""About two hundred years ago, the witch Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green) took revenge on her former lover Barnabas Collins (Depp) after he jilted her. She killed his family, made his fiancee commit suicide, turned him into a vampire, and got him buried for two hundred years.When Barnabas is accidentally dug up, it's the 1970s. After snacking on some road workers, he heads straight back to the old family manor. The Collins family -- led by the dour matriarch Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer) -- has seen its fortunes decline over the centuries, and Barnabas is determined to restore them. He also immediately falls for Victoria (Bella Heathcote), who is an exact doppelganger for his dead fiancee.However, it turns out that Angelique is still kicking around because... well, she's a witch, so apparently that makes her immortal. She's still carrying a torch for Barnabas. And she's been responsible for the family ""curse."" And, well, she's opened a rival fish cannery that is threatening the old family biz. When Barnabas turns her down again, she's out for revenge...If you've seen even some of Tim Burton's other movies, then you know pretty much what to expect from ""Dark Shadows."" Burton is just regurgitating the same things he always does -- it stars Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter, there's pancake makeup with sunken raccoon eyes, a Skellington scarecrow, gothic houses with lots of sharp angles, wild hair, etc.Burton's style is not the problem, though... but the fact that he turned a story of tragedy and revenge into a COMEDY is. And even as a comedy, it fails.Instead we get endless gags relying on Barnabas' culture shock (oh ha ha, he's confused by the TV), and how he's so obviously a vampire but the Collins clan never notices. And once the backstory is out of the way, Burton seems to lose interest in the plot -- he simply flings around a dozen random plot threads, culminating in a confusing deus-ex-machina climax with random ghosts and werewolves popping up to fight Angelique.There's also an ugly misogynistic tone to the movie -- every woman is either a vengeful scorned harpy who can't move on, a vain age-obsessed skank or a blank-faced nonentity like Victoria.Johnny Depp is admittedly doing what he can here, but the character of Barnabas is just embarrassing -- he comes across as a blithering idiot and a huge cad. Depp is charming, but not charming enough. Heathcote has the charisma and acting ability of a log, and most of the other actors are wasted (Pfeiffer, Green, Chlo Grace Moretz, Jonny Lee Miller).It boggles the imagination that ""Dark Shadows"" was made by actual fans of the original TV show, because frankly it's hard to imagine a worse adaptation being made by people who hated it.

In my mind it disrespects on the original, and poor comedy at that. 2) it doesn't even develop any of the other characters at all AND all but completely ignores the Victoria Winters character.At it's core the original Dark Shadows was a tragic love story between Barnabas, a several hundred year old vampire and Victoria's uncanny resemblance to his long lost love Jos&eacute;tte Duperies. But they basically threw in the major characters that were in the original series jut to get them all in an didn't really use them for more than set dressing for Depp. They were never fleshed out at all, provided no motivation and you had no idea who they even were (unless you knew from before).Did you even know that many stars from the TV show made a mass cameo?

1470616,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B005LAIHKY,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[3, 6]","DARK SHADOWS (Prod. Johnny Depp, Dir. Tim Burton, 2012, 113 minutes) was a delightfully Gothic, dramatic remake of creator Dan Curtis' original filmHouse of Dark Shadows(see my review), though the film credits itself as based on the television series, which of course Curtis created first. We watched ""Dark Shadows"" on TV all the time from day one, several years before Jonathan Frid came on board as Barnabas Collins. All that work was unique, as I well knew at the time. It set the high bar for vampire, werewolf, ghost and other Gothic stories pretty much forever.We used to run home from school in order to catch ""Dark Shadows"".Here Johnny Depp does a stunning combination of Jonathan Frid and Christopher Lee (who has a cameo here) - mostly channeling Frid in his portrayal of Barnabas Collins. I found Depp showing a depth of skill here that another actor would have ruined in a heartbeat. Don't believe me? See Ben Cross in the weak TV remake of ""Dark Shadows""! It was stunning to note that Frid had a cameo appearance twice in the film, along with other original cast members. This is Jonathan Frid's final film appearance; our greatest vampire ever departed this life back in April (2012). R.I.P., Barnabas.In fact, Depp did his best to bring Frid back to life with his portrayal but it is nothing like a mere impersonation. Depp adds his own spices to this, as he always does with any role, and some of the most touching moments are also laugh-out-loud thanks to his skill. Frid had similar skills as an actor.This film is not typically Burton, in the sense that Burton has perfected high Gothic drama - something he touched on inSleepy Hollow. Yet the moving and appropriate humor does not get in the way of the tragedy of the deeply wounded Collins descendants. Seeing the decay and misery spurs Barnabas to devote himself to assisting his relatives. Their misery is not helped by the apparently immortal witch Angelique, which we old fans recall from the original TV series. Sadly there is no Reverend Trask in this film.Another detail to examine is the way Burton married the two past eras, pre-Revolutionary America and 1970s America. The way he managed to bridge the two was simple: he left it all on Depp's capable shoulders. What we may not catch on the first viewing is the skill Burton brings to this, from the cinematography to the incidental music. Burton's ability to slip in homages and spoofs is really something everyone should see - I cannot begin to describe the references here, but I can tell you he took potshots atHarry Potter Years 1 - 5as well as the originalNosferatu.I will decry the silly sexual junk that Burton most certainly could have skipped; it prevented this film from reaching its ultimate potential. Even so, it takes one hell of a filmmaker to do such a glorious and enjoyable remake. Also, I was deeply unhappy with the 1970s songs in the soundtrack, looking forward instead to some original Danny Elfman music that never seemed to present itself.Incidentally, this is Tim Burton's eighth film with Johnny Depp, his seventh film with Helena Bonham Carter (in a stunning turn as Dr. Julia Hoffman and doing a fine take on Grayson Hall's original portrayal), his fifth film with Christopher Lee, and his second film with Michelle Pfeiffer.

1470625,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B005LAIHKY,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[5, 10]","Warner Bros. Home Entertainment is doing the smart thing and releasing Tim Burton's ""Dark Shadows"" just in time to soak up some Halloween spirit. The film performed poorly in studios but will no doubt do good business on Blu-ray and DVD since the holiday season puts people in the mood to see something spooky and kooky to celebrate. ""Dark Shadows"" is perfect for viewers who want to get the chills and some thrills but not overdose on them. A good helping of humor helps to balance things out.The vampire Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) returns to his home town of Collinsport after being locked up in a coffin for two centuries. He discovers the witch Angelique (Eva Green) who cursed him is alive and well. The small fishing town his father founded is now under her control. Barnabas must find a way to restore his family name to its rightful glory. He also longs to be free of his curse and the hunger for blood it causes him to have. At the same time, a new visitor (Bella Heathcote) to Collinswood resembles his lost love from centuries before. Could she be the reincarnated woman he's longed for so long?""Dark Shadows"" has the same perfect blend of sophisticated and unrefined humor we've come to expect from director Tim Burton. You could say it's a blend of ""Beetlejuice"" comicality and the gothic seriousness of ""Sleepy Hollow."" Most of the comedy comes thanks to Depp's portrayal of the ""out-of-time"" Barnabas being exposed to 1972 culture and technology. That's not to say the horror and supernatural elements are put on the back burner. They're very much present and play a big part in the movie.The high-definition transfer of ""Dark Shadows"" is stunning. All the darks colors stand out in contrast and Burton's beautifully gloomy color schemes shine through nicely. Helena Bonham Carter's red hair dances across the screen clashing with the grey scenery around her. It also brings out all the nooks and crannies of the old Collinswood mansion.The 5.1 surround sound mix spreads out all the creepy sounds, creaks, crashing waves, and Danny Elfman's masterful score throughout the speakers. It will heighten the viewing experience in a home theater.Special features included in the Blu-ray edition consist of Maximum Movie Mode, Focus Points, and deleted scenes. Maximum Movie Mode gives us picture-in-picture commentary from Tim Burton, cast, and crew about different facets of the movie. 37-minutes of Focus Points are broke up into different featurettes entitled ""Becoming Barnabas,"" ""Welcome to Collinsport,"" ""The Collinses: Every Family Has Its Demons,"" ""Reliving a Decade,"" ""Angelique: A Witch Scorned,"" ""Alice Cooper Rocks Collinsport,"" ""Dark Shadowy Secrets,"" ""A Melee of Monstrous Proportions"" and ""'Dark Shadows:' The Legend Bites Back."" Five deleted scenes round out the bonus material.I think if people give ""Dark Shadows"" a chance on Blu-ray or DVD, they'll discover an entertaining Tim Burton film that celebrates the television show many of us grew up watching. It's one of the best examples of a movie where the directors and stars successfully poke fun at the unintended campiness of its source material while being reverent to it at the same time. If you're a fan of Burton, his ensemble casts, and / or Johnny Depp, ""Dark Shadows"" is a must-see.",4,"Blu-ray Review: ""Dark Shadows""",1348790400,"09 28, 2012",2012,3275,"['Warner', 'Bros.', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'doing', 'smart', 'thing', 'releasing', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'just', 'time', 'soak', 'up', 'Halloween', 'spirit', 'film', 'performed', 'poorly', 'studios', 'will', 'doubt', 'do', 'good', 'business', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'holiday', 'season', 'people', 'mood', 'see', 'something', 'spooky', 'kooky', 'celebrate', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'perfect', 'viewers', 'who', 'want', 'get', 'chills', 'thrills', 'not', 'overdose', 'good', 'helping', 'humor', 'balance', 'things', 'out.The', 'vampire', 'Barnabas', 'Collins', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'home', 'town', 'Collinsport', 'being', 'locked', 'up', 'coffin', 'two', 'centuries', 'witch', 'Angelique', 'Eva', 'Green', 'who', 'cursed', 'alive', 'well', 'small', 'fishing', 'town', 'father', 'founded', 'now', 'control', 'Barnabas', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'restore', 'family', 'name', 'rightful', 'glory', 'also', 'be', 'free', 'curse', 'hunger', 'blood', 'have', 'same', 'time', 'new', 'visitor', 'Bella', 'Heathcote', 'Collinswood', 'resembles', 'lost', 'love', 'centuries', 'Could', 'be', 'reincarnated', 'woman', 'longed', 'so', 'long', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'same', 'perfect', 'blend', 'sophisticated', 'unrefined', 'humor', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'director', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'could', 'say', 'blend', 'Beetlejuice', 'comicality', 'gothic', 'seriousness', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'Most', 'comedy', 'thanks', 'Depp', 'portrayal', 'out-of-time', 'Barnabas', 'being', 'exposed', '1972', 'culture', 'technology', 'not', 'say', 'horror', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'are', 'put', 'back', 'burner', ""'re"", 'very', 'much', 'present', 'play', 'big', 'part', 'movie.The', 'high-definition', 'transfer', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'stunning', 'darks', 'colors', 'stand', 'out', 'contrast', 'Burton', 'beautifully', 'gloomy', 'color', 'schemes', 'shine', 'nicely', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'red', 'hair', 'dances', 'screen', 'clashing', 'grey', 'scenery', 'also', 'out', 'nooks', 'crannies', 'old', 'Collinswood', 'mansion.The', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'mix', 'spreads', 'out', 'creepy', 'creaks', 'crashing', 'waves', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'masterful', 'score', 'speakers', 'will', 'heighten', 'viewing', 'experience', 'home', 'theater.Special', 'features', 'included', 'Blu-ray', 'edition', 'consist', 'Maximum', 'Movie', 'Mode', 'Focus', 'Points', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Maximum', 'Movie', 'Mode', 'picture-in-picture', 'commentary', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'cast', 'crew', 'different', 'facets', 'movie', '37-minutes', 'Focus', 'Points', 'are', 'broke', 'up', 'different', 'featurettes', 'entitled', 'Becoming', 'Barnabas', 'Welcome', 'Collinsport', 'Collinses', 'Family', 'Has', 'Demons', 'Reliving', 'Decade', 'Angelique', 'Witch', 'Scorned', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'Rocks', 'Collinsport', 'Dark', 'Shadowy', 'Secrets', 'A', 'Melee', 'Monstrous', 'Proportions', ""'Dark"", 'Legend', 'Bites', 'Back', 'Five', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'round', 'out', 'bonus', 'material.I', 'think', 'people', 'give', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'chance', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'discover', 'entertaining', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'film', 'television', 'show', 'many', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'one', 'best', 'examples', 'movie', 'where', 'directors', 'stars', 'successfully', 'poke', 'fun', 'unintended', 'campiness', 'source', 'material', 'being', 'reverent', 'same', 'time', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Burton', 'ensemble', 'casts', '/', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'must-see']",N/A

I realize its based on an old tv show that most have never seen but that should have been a good thing.For one, why did it take place in the 1970s?  That is not interesting at all. It should have taken place in modern times or at least it should have played around with the time and culture change some more.  Second, there was no consistent tone and too many plot holes.For example, where did Barnaba's descendants come from if he had no children and no obvious brothers or sisters? Also why did he kill those innocent hippies if he was getting blood transfusions? Furthermore why is the fact that he keeps banging Angelique never surface in the eyes of his girlfriend?The plot was full of potential but the outcome was boring.

1470641,A3LQDYVAAHHV2T,B005LAIHKY,FYI,"[1, 1]","I'm glad the '70s are ""in"" again; by it's very nature, the classic Dark Shadows series is timeless. Many savor the classic gothic drama, with its tremendous cast. This spin-off film's best part, aside from the opening sequence with the train and Moody Blues (easy to script-write, a give away), is the momentary glimpse of favorites: Kathryn Leigh Scott, Lara Parker, David Selby, and Jonathan Frid; what good sports! Sadly, the new movie is not respectful of the series or actors, past and present. What a wasted opportunity, with a disappointing squandering of talent, resources, and classic story lines. Why alter the narrative so clumsily? There is no clear point of view, just a chaotic collage of images. Changing the demise of Barnabas' parents, Joshua and Naomi, is just one departure. The film drastically departs from many story-lines, and alters Maggie Evans in a bizarre way; Tim Burton turns Vickie into Maggie Evans. Except for the Moody Blues opening, Karen Carpenter (and other) music lends nothing. Burton inflicts that WHOLE Carpenter song on viewers (trite cynicism? Burton lost his mind) during what should have been a fun scene. The wrong Witch of Eastwick was cast; Susan Sarandon would have played our darkly mysterious matriarch Elizabeth Collins/Joan Bennett far better. Julia Hoffman is a throw-away part, as is Caroline - a desultory werewolf. Dr. Julia Hoffman's role is mangled, and Angelique is a brittle (literally) bore. Collinwood manor burns to the ground. What a mess, and a misuse of the goodwill numerous fans would have been happy to give. Tim Burton has his head up his wide child-bearing-sized hips. What's with that fixation? This film is the rant of a guy afraid to grow old, with riffs from his therapist's couch tossed in. There is a difference between honest vintage camp and contemporary mocking; Tim Burton lacks the ballast to discern between the two.

But then the trailers came out and I wondered if they had flubbed it all up.  I was prepared to be disappointed big time.That being said, I went to the movie after all and enjoyed quite a bit of it.  Much much more than I expected to.  Yes, it had little to do with the tone of the original series (which I also loved) and some of the humor fell flat on occasion.  But the overall look to the movie was fabulous and many of the scenes were really really funny, mostly those that involved Barnabus having to deal with the 1970's.  Well, and some of the scenes were just funny because of looking back at the 1970's in general.Basically, once I stopped expecting it to be the old classic Dark Shadows, I enjoyed it for what it was.

1470644,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B005LAIHKY,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[1, 1]","The original DARK SHADOWS was a soap opera that aired on ABC from 1966 to 1971.  The series did not draw a significant audience and was on the verge of cancellation when creator and producer Dan Curtis began adding supernatural storylines.  Suddenly the ratings took off, and the series remained popular until changing tastes, a lack of fresh material, and unusually high production costs brought it to a sudden end.Over the years there have been two films with the original cast, HOUSE OF DARK SHADOWS and NIGHT OF DARK SHADOWS, and two attempts at a series revival.  In 2012 20th Century Fox released a star-studded feature film titled DARK SHADOWS, developed and directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Helena Boham Carter.  The film received mixed reviews, and although it did reasonably well in America and even better in Europe, it was regarded as a box office disappointment.The film begins with a five minute recap of the basic soap opera storyline, radically condensed and significantly tweaked.  Barnabas Collins (Depp) narrates his life from his boyhood in England to coming of age in America, the son of a prosperous family.  Although he has an physical affair with servant girl Angelique (Eva Green), it is really Josette (Bella Heathcote) he loves--and Angelique, secretly a powerful witch, responds by killing his parents, driving Josette to suicide, and turning Barnabas into a vampire.All of this is preface: the film actually begins when Barnabas is accidentally freed from the coffin in which Angelique has trapped for close to two hundred years.  He experiences considerable culture shock, but he nonetheless finds his way to the family home, Collinwood, where he enters into a pact with family matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Pfeiffer) to revive the family fortunes.  His relationship with the family is complicated by governess Victoria Winters (Bella Heathcote again), who bears a remarkable resemblance to Josette.  But Angelique is still lurking about, determined to gain Barnabas' love, even if she has to destroy the entire family to do it.The movie is very stylish in terms of designs and visuals, but although the script starts out well and finishes well, it has a great big huge sagging middle.  There are occasionally effective moments of parody and a few interesting special effects, but that's pretty much it.  Depp is merely adequate.  Pfeiffer is wasted.  Helena Bonham Carter is miscast.  The plot is fairly uninteresting and the script uninspired.When the film debuted a good many critics commented that while Burton and Depp have done several good films together, their artistic collaboration seems to have run its course, and they would be better off going in different directions.  Much the same could be said of Burton and Helena Bohnam Carter; Burton seems determined to cast his girlfriend in one film after another, but he never seems to find her an appropriate part, and she is particular dire as Dr. Hoffman.DARK SHADOWS isn't as bad as its detractors claim.  Unfortunately, it isn't as good as its supporters would have you believe.  In the end, it is trivial.  Recommended to hardcore fans of Burton and his stars, but that's all.Gary TaylorAmazon Reviewer",2,Trivial and Tiresome,1386374400,"12 7, 2013",2013,3242,"['original', 'DARK', 'SHADOWS', 'was', 'soap', 'opera', 'aired', 'ABC', '1966', '1971', 'series', 'did', 'not', 'draw', 'significant', 'audience', 'was', 'verge', 'cancellation', 'when', 'creator', 'producer', 'Dan', 'Curtis', 'began', 'adding', 'supernatural', 'storylines', 'Suddenly', 'ratings', 'took', 'off', 'series', 'remained', 'popular', 'changing', 'tastes', 'lack', 'fresh', 'material', 'unusually', 'high', 'production', 'costs', 'brought', 'sudden', 'end.Over', 'years', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'two', 'films', 'original', 'cast', 'HOUSE', 'OF', 'DARK', 'SHADOWS', 'NIGHT', 'OF', 'DARK', 'SHADOWS', 'two', 'attempts', 'series', 'revival', '2012', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'released', 'star-studded', 'feature', 'film', 'titled', 'DARK', 'SHADOWS', 'developed', 'directed', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'starring', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'Helena', 'Boham', 'Carter', 'film', 'received', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'did', 'reasonably', 'well', 'America', 'even', 'better', 'Europe', 'was', 'regarded', 'box', 'office', 'disappointment.The', 'film', 'five', 'minute', 'recap', 'basic', 'soap', 'opera', 'storyline', 'radically', 'condensed', 'significantly', 'tweaked', 'Barnabas', 'Collins', 'Depp', 'life', 'boyhood', 'England', 'coming', 'age', 'America', 'son', 'prosperous', 'family', 'physical', 'affair', 'servant', 'girl', 'Angelique', 'Eva', 'Green', 'really', 'Josette', 'Bella', 'Heathcote', 'Angelique', 'secretly', 'powerful', 'witch', 'responds', 'killing', 'parents', 'driving', 'Josette', 'suicide', 'turning', 'Barnabas', 'vampire.All', 'preface', 'film', 'actually', 'when', 'Barnabas', 'accidentally', 'freed', 'coffin', 'Angelique', 'trapped', 'close', 'two', 'hundred', 'years', 'considerable', 'culture', 'shock', 'nonetheless', 'way', 'family', 'home', 'Collinwood', 'where', 'pact', 'family', 'matriarch', 'Elizabeth', 'Collins', 'Stoddard', 'Pfeiffer', 'revive', 'family', 'fortunes', 'relationship', 'family', 'complicated', 'governess', 'Victoria', 'Winters', 'Bella', 'Heathcote', 'again', 'who', 'remarkable', 'resemblance', 'Josette', 'Angelique', 'still', 'lurking', 'about', 'determined', 'gain', 'Barnabas', 'love', 'even', 'destroy', 'entire', 'family', 'do', 'it.The', 'movie', 'very', 'stylish', 'terms', 'designs', 'visuals', 'script', 'out', 'well', 'finishes', 'well', 'great', 'big', 'huge', 'sagging', 'middle', 'are', 'occasionally', 'effective', 'moments', 'parody', 'few', 'interesting', 'special', 'effects', 'pretty', 'much', 'Depp', 'merely', 'adequate', 'Pfeiffer', 'wasted', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'miscast', 'plot', 'fairly', 'uninteresting', 'script', 'film', 'debuted', 'good', 'many', 'critics', 'commented', 'Burton', 'Depp', 'have', 'done', 'several', 'good', 'films', 'together', 'artistic', 'collaboration', 'have', 'run', 'course', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'going', 'different', 'directions', 'Much', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'Burton', 'Helena', 'Bohnam', 'Carter', 'Burton', 'determined', 'cast', 'girlfriend', 'one', 'film', 'never', 'find', 'appropriate', 'part', 'particular', 'dire', 'Dr.', 'Hoffman.DARK', 'SHADOWS', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'detractors', 'claim', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'supporters', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'end', 'trivial', 'Recommended', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'Burton', 'stars', 'all.Gary', 'TaylorAmazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

Himes,"[4, 7]","This is a review for the film, not the DVD, as it's release is more than a month off at the time of this writing.The promos and trailers for this were awful... if the film were as completely bad, it would have been worst or second-worst of the year (even though the year has yet to finish).The theatrical trailer had all the humorous bad-bits in the movie, excepting a few.  Unfortunately, the humor was not left to what one would normally expect for a horror film.  If you watched ""Time After Time,"" which was a thriller/romance, the humor, which kept the film from getting too dark, was revealed primarily with Wells' ignorance with the future.  It was therefore well placed and not distracting to the story.  Not here.  Even though many jokes are based in the main character's ignorance of future times (and the 70's in particular), they are delivered with severe heavy-handedness. So, often they are very funny, but all to a severe detriment to the film.  Then, throughout a majority of the film, Barnabas' inexperience is ignored, making the situations less believable.For fans of the classic TV series (like me), this will be very offensive, even though there are little additional pieces in the film which build on, or are at least a respectful salute to the show.  And there were a couple of ""outside the Dark Shadows"" mythos bits that were impressive, as well as a few background pieces (like the history of the cannery).The worst thing about the film, as a standalone, is that it seems like it was written by three or four people, only one who had watched the original, and only one other who had any real intelligence and creativity.  It had no feel that the screenplay had been properly edited by anyone, to make it a coherent streamlined piece.  It is very choppy and things constantly seem to be coming out of ""left-field.""  This occurs throughout the film, from the start, to the end.  As one reviewer mentioned, that after the starting monologue it completely changes tone... all the way to the end, where we get two or three revelations one after the other... (how about this?  Well, then, what do you think of that? No? Then try this!).  That was the biggest joke of the movie, even though one of the reveals was quite funny.  And seriously, how bad does a film have to be, to have a huge angry mob outside of a mansion, which includes numerous police, and not have them do anything (well, at least if they aren't paralyzed).The movie was quite uneven.. so much so, I would normally give a film only two stars.  However, I'm giving it three, because of all of the other elements of the film, the atmosphere, costumes, set-design, and music, all of which were way above average.Burton has done much better work, and so has Depp, (as a producer here -- not blaming him for the acting, which it seems most actors did well with what they were given).  In fact, they've done excellent things together. But not here.My big question after seeing this, is, how can one take such a rich canvas, claim respect for it, and then bollocks it up so badly with elements that clearly do not respect it.  Seriously, the trailer alone seemed to have but one aim, and that was to make everybody familiar with the original, ill, and to drive them away.This is worth a watch. But, as others have said, once you see this, track down the original serial, and watch that.  Do note that that the original story started earlier, with ghosts, curses, and murder, before it got around to the famous vampire, Barnabas.Dark Shadows: The Complete Original Series (Deluxe Edition)House of Dark ShadowsNight of Dark ShadowsDark Shadows: The Revival - The Complete SeriesFinal Note: digital copies (even though often encoded cleaner than DVDs), are basically a waste unless they are ACTUALLY ENCODED ON the media you purchased, with NO INTERNET REQUIRED.  Anything you have to download costs extra in bandwidth, massive hard disc and backup space, allows the studios to track you, is not watchable directly on most devices other than a PC, and is unwatchable past the expiration date if anything happens to your computer.  So I can never recommend anything by the fact that it has a digital copy... unless you have a program which removes the DRM from your legitimate downloads.This type of thing was done in the 90's with CD-ROM/CD-extra material, and NONE, without exception, worked more than a couple years past their release.  I have more than 40 examples of this from early Windows and Macintosh software put on music CDs.  I don't have more, because I refused to buy anything that had critical material based on these schemes. Don't put money into anything that relies on the life of an internet page -- think about it -- how many commercial internet pages still exist at the same address and page that they did a couple years back? How many even still exist in any form at all?DO NOT ALLOW STUDIOS TO BAIT YOU LIKE THIS!",3,"Not as bad as the promos, but...",1345593600,"08 22, 2012",2012,4911,"['review', 'film', 'not', 'DVD', 'release', 'more', 'month', 'off', 'time', 'writing.The', 'promos', 'trailers', 'were', 'awful', 'film', 'were', 'completely', 'bad', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'worst', 'second-worst', 'year', 'even', 'year', 'yet', 'finish', '.The', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'had', 'humorous', 'bad-bits', 'movie', 'excepting', 'few', 'Unfortunately', 'humor', 'was', 'not', 'left', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'normally', 'expect', 'horror', 'film', 'watched', 'Time', 'Time', 'was', 'thriller/romance', 'humor', 'kept', 'film', 'getting', 'too', 'dark', 'was', 'revealed', 'primarily', 'Wells', 'ignorance', 'future', 'was', 'therefore', 'well', 'placed', 'not', 'distracting', 'story', 'Not', 'here', 'Even', 'many', 'jokes', 'are', 'based', 'main', 'character', 'ignorance', 'future', 'times', '70', 'particular', 'are', 'delivered', 'severe', 'heavy-handedness', 'So', 'often', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'severe', 'detriment', 'film', 'Then', 'majority', 'film', 'Barnabas', 'inexperience', 'ignored', 'making', 'situations', 'less', 'believable.For', 'fans', 'classic', 'TV', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'offensive', 'even', 'are', 'little', 'additional', 'pieces', 'film', 'build', 'are', 'least', 'respectful', 'salute', 'show', 'were', 'couple', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'mythos', 'bits', 'were', 'impressive', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'background', 'pieces', 'history', 'cannery', 'worst', 'thing', 'film', 'standalone', 'was', 'written', 'three', 'four', 'people', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'had', 'watched', 'original', 'only', 'one', 'other', 'who', 'had', 'real', 'intelligence', 'creativity', 'had', 'feel', 'screenplay', 'had', 'been', 'properly', 'edited', 'anyone', 'make', 'coherent', 'streamlined', 'piece', 'very', 'choppy', 'things', 'constantly', 'seem', 'be', 'coming', 'left-field', 'film', 'start', 'end', 'one', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'starting', 'monologue', 'completely', 'tone', 'way', 'end', 'where', 'get', 'two', 'three', 'revelations', 'one', 'other', 'how', 'Well', 'then', 'what', 'do', 'think', 'Then', 'try', 'was', 'biggest', 'joke', 'movie', 'even', 'one', 'reveals', 'was', 'quite', 'funny', 'seriously', 'how', 'bad', 'film', 'have', 'be', 'have', 'huge', 'angry', 'mob', 'mansion', 'numerous', 'police', 'not', 'have', 'do', 'anything', 'well', 'least', 'are', ""n't"", 'paralyzed', '.The', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'uneven..', 'so', 'much', 'would', 'normally', 'give', 'film', 'only', 'two', 'stars', 'However', ""'m"", 'giving', 'three', 'other', 'elements', 'film', 'atmosphere', 'costumes', 'set-design', 'music', 'were', 'way', 'average.Burton', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'work', 'so', 'Depp', 'producer', 'here', 'not', 'blaming', 'acting', 'most', 'actors', 'did', 'well', 'what', 'were', 'given', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'done', 'excellent', 'things', 'together', 'not', 'here.My', 'big', 'question', 'seeing', 'how', 'can', 'one', 'take', 'rich', 'canvas', 'claim', 'respect', 'then', 'bollocks', 'up', 'so', 'badly', 'elements', 'clearly', 'do', 'not', 'respect', 'Seriously', 'trailer', 'alone', 'seemed', 'have', 'one', 'aim', 'was', 'make', 'everybody', 'familiar', 'original', 'ill', 'drive', 'away.This', 'watch', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'once', 'see', 'track', 'down', 'original', 'serial', 'watch', 'Do', 'note', 'original', 'story', 'started', 'earlier', 'ghosts', 'curses', 'murder', 'got', 'around', 'famous', 'vampire', 'Barnabas.Dark', 'Shadows', 'Complete', 'Original', 'Series', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'House', 'Dark', 'ShadowsNight', 'Dark', 'ShadowsDark', 'Shadows', 'Revival', 'Complete', 'SeriesFinal', 'Note', 'digital', 'copies', 'even', 'often', 'encoded', 'cleaner', 'DVDs', 'are', 'basically', 'waste', 'are', 'ACTUALLY', 'ENCODED', 'ON', 'media', 'purchased', 'INTERNET', 'REQUIRED', 'Anything', 'have', 'download', 'costs', 'extra', 'bandwidth', 'massive', 'hard', 'disc', 'backup', 'space', 'studios', 'track', 'not', 'watchable', 'directly', 'most', 'devices', 'other', 'PC', 'unwatchable', 'expiration', 'date', 'anything', 'computer', 'can', 'never', 'recommend', 'anything', 'fact', 'digital', 'copy', 'have', 'program', 'DRM', 'legitimate', 'downloads.This', 'type', 'thing', 'was', 'done', '90', 'CD-ROM/CD-extra', 'material', 'NONE', 'exception', 'worked', 'more', 'couple', 'years', 'release', 'have', 'more', '40', 'examples', 'early', 'Windows', 'Macintosh', 'software', 'put', 'music', 'CDs', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'more', 'refused', 'buy', 'anything', 'had', 'critical', 'material', 'based', 'schemes', 'Do', ""n't"", 'put', 'money', 'anything', 'life', 'internet', 'page', 'think', 'how', 'many', 'commercial', 'internet', 'pages', 'still', 'exist', 'same', 'address', 'page', 'did', 'couple', 'years', 'back', 'How', 'many', 'even', 'still', 'exist', 'form', 'DO', 'NOT', 'ALLOW', 'STUDIOS', 'TO', 'BAIT', 'YOU', 'THIS']",N/A

1470657,A26TY6GCGBF5HT,B005LAIHKY,Graves,"[6, 9]","This was a daring premise. Take a 1960's soap opera that ran for years and condense it into a 2 hour movie. Tim Burton is a past master of the macabre and Jonny Depp brings all his very considerable talents to bare but in the end, this was just too much for even them.Depp plays Barnabas Collins, a man from the days of colonial America cursed to be a vampire by the witch he scorned and buried alive (buried undead?) by the townspeople. Flash to 1972 and he is dug up by a construction crew and returns home to find the family has fallen on hard times, as the witch, still around and looking fabulous as a 217 year old business woman, has actively gone after the family as a hobby all these years. Depp sets out to restore the family.All well and good but the film early on picks up and drops so many potential story threads it gets aggravating. For example the first scenes of the film in the modern world introduce us to the new governess who's going to be teaching the young son of the family, ""the loony"" who won't accept that his mother, lost at sea is really dead. You think this will be a major plot line but once Depp arrives and revives the family fortune you forget about the governess until you see her standing in a family setting during a montage of goings on. Why did I waste all that time caring about her in the early scenes you ask? Likewise when Depp reveals the lost treasure hidden in the house, to Michelle Pfieffer, the current matriarch, she says they should keep its existence a secret between just them. He agrees. It's implied she doesn't trust her brother in law with the money. But during a montage of the house being extensively remodeled he walks though it clueless to the cost. The problem is the one scene he had before has him complaining about the poor quality of food they must endure and how his son has cut holes in sheets to pretend to be a ghost-he goes from being very aware of cost to clueless about  restorations?It's reported the town is freaked out by several deaths at a construction site- the freshly dug up Barnabas was hungry, but that sort of fades into the background too.My guess is there's a lot on the cutting room floor or maybe they were hoping for a sequel but after a while it was too much. I started to wonder why should I have any emotion invested in story X if it is going to get dropped 2 scenes later without resolution? And this was fatal to me. If I don't want to get involved why pay attention to the plots? They're just get dropped right? Family fortune, cute governess, troubled boy with ghosts, cunning matriarch and a sexy witch and who cares? Too many threads picked up and dropped. You can't believe they'kll resolve them all, nicely in so short a time.If you don't care enough to get involved then you don't care to watch.

1470659,A1SHNOU2ODKIDG,B005LAIHKY,Gregorio,"[9, 12]","Tim Burton takes everything that made the original series so wonderful and trashes it.  I'll admit this is a very beautiful looking film and the cast is for the most part very good but the story is so poorly executed that it simply becomes a CGI spectacle by the time the film lurches to its routine conclusion.  Burton makes some unforgivable errors with the story.  By turning the Collins family into a down on their luck bunch of has beens, turning Collinwood into a dump (and then burning it down), making theCollins family an object of hatred in the town of Collinsport, rather than the respected community institution, and changing the nature of ALL of the characters from the series...it just isn't DARK SHADOWS any more.  Even cameos from original cast members are wasted, as is the appearance by Alice Cooper.  Nothing works.  The entire film has been boiled down to a movie by committee.  You can see all the places where studio execs have had their input and alterations made from endless test screenings. It ends up being another typical bloated Hollywood extravaganza lacking heart, creativity and emotion.  Sincerity and originality are no where to be seen on screen.  I will say that the costumes and set design are gorgeous and if they had been put to use in a film that had an authentic script instead of this cobbled together atrocity they could have really enhanced the film.Now I'm not just another fan of the series complaining that they changed everything.  When I saw the first trailer for the film I was shocked and delighted to find that the film was a comedy.  I would have been fine with a comic take on the beloved characters.  As it turns out, THE FILM IS NOT REALLY A COMEDY, in fact it seems to have no idea what it is.  ALL of the comic bits were shown in the trailer and the rest of the film is played pretty much as a strange fish out of water horror drama.  The sudden shifts in tone are jarring and mostly obnoxious.  With such a talented cast and gorgeous look, this film is such a missed opportunity that it is depressing.  All of the merits of the film (and there are a lot of them) simply are not enough to save it from an awful script and a wildly self-indulgent director who seems to have run out of original ideas and simply keeps remaking his own tired movies over and over and over again. I doubt I'll see another take on DARK SHADOWS in my lifetime since this one was a failure at the box office and despised by most critics.  Too bad.The Bluray transfer is fantastic.  Not a flaw to be seen anywhere.  Absolutely beautiful.  I bought the bluray only edition and it has one short documentary as an extra feature.  A pretty bare bones affair in keeping with Warner Bros new ultra cheap standard blu ray releases complete with no artwork on the disc and a bluray case so flimsy it will fall apart if looked at.  Menus are also bare bones (actually a good thing) and the disc loads quickly with no BD live garbage and no forced trailers.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[6, 11]","Maybe someday Tim Burton will wander back from cuckooland and once more make movies that grip you beyond the pretty,pretty visuals. DARK SHADOWS starts out so promisingly, getting me so enthused, and then, as it went on, the awfulness seeped in and built and built. Here I am, tearing out of the movie theater, in a foul, condemning mood. My date's asking that I not walk so fast, but I can't get out of there fast enough.I've no concrete point of reference to compare this film adaptation to, although the original television cult classic had been around for decades, lurking as this creaky pop culture trivia. But I thought the film instantly assumes a vibrant gothic presence and unveils a captivating introductory segment. In short strokes, this opening passage chronicles the establishing of a Maine fishing village in the 18th century and the life and death - and then undeath - of Barnabas Collins, scion of the founding Collins family. Barnabas Collins, who fails to love a comely witch and is cursed with vampirism. The villagers turn on him. They bury him in the dirt.- Barnabas Collins: ""Tell me, future dweller, what is the year?""- Willie Loomis: ""1972.""Jackie Earle Haley (always reliable) plays Willie Loomis, butler to the present-day Collins clan and the first person Barnabas doesn't bite upon his release from entombment. Two hundred years (or, to be exact, 196 years) after being put in the ground, Barnabas bursts out of his coffin, shatters the chains encircling it, finds himself in today's modern era, in 1972. He makes a beeline for his ancestral home, now reduced to a dusty and dilapidated estate.Barnabas encounters his distant descendants and worms his way into their ambivalent graces, passing himself off as a relative from overseas. Only Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer), the stern matriarch, knows the truth of Barnabas. In the passing centuries, the family fortunes have plummeted. Barnabas vows to return the Collins family to its former stature of wealth and prominence. He doesn't know yet that he's set himself against a familiar supernatural presence. It's sort of apropos that in 1972 the Eagles released their single ""Witchy Woman.""You eyeball this glittering lineup and assume that you're in for some powerhouse performances. Except that this unfolds mostly as a one man show. Johnny Depp is undeniably fabulous, and if that's all you're looking for in this flick, then you'll walk away sated. You have to allow for Depp's affectations, his character's arch mannerisms, those expressive, elongated fingers of his. You have to, I guess, allow for his character's lack of accountability. Barnabas pretty much gets away with murdering a bunch of people, but never mind, never mind. I frankly love what Depp does with this role. But then most everyone else follows suit, and that negates the effectiveness of what Depp was trying to do. Pfeiffer, Helena Bonham Carter, even Chlo Grace Moretz all submit such stylized performances that I had a problem relating to them. Only Eva Green, as the wicked and long-lived Angelique Bouchard, brings it with vivid energy and great enthusiasm. Down the centuries, the witch Angelique had become a powerufl and influential figure in this fishing community. Compelled by dark designs, she promptly renews acquaintances with the lover who once spurned her.I admit to relishing the fish-out-of-water gags surrounding Barnabas' 18th century sensibilities colliding with the modern-day culture of 1972. He gazes, entranced, at a lava lamp, thinking it composed of blood and urine. He hangs out with hippies. He thinks the ""M"" on a MacDonald's stands for ""Mephistopholes."" But the best bit may be Alice Cooper's cameo at the ball, with Barnabas gazing at him thru opera glasses and muttering: ""Ugliest woman I have ever seen."" It's a shame the film denies us the thrill of a unique interaction between Barnabas and Alice. It's just one more missed opportunity.I don't think Tim Burton can craft an ugly-looking film if his life depended on it. DARK SHADOWS is cinematically well-executed. It treats us to a series of sumptuous visuals. But it's hollow gratification, yo. The story suffers from poor character development, the lack of a narrative drive, the actors' languid approach, and an underdeveloped and absolutely unearned love story. About the last, Barnabas keeps refering to the slim governess he adores as possessing these ""fertile birthing hips,"" except that she totally doesn't, so what was he going on about? The campiness and sense of satire are so marked that they pretty much overwhelm whatever meager grounding the film has. I admire Depp's performance, but I don't care about his character. I don't care about any of these characters. I don't perceive them as anything but caricatures. Anyway, the narrative, ultimately, takes a back seat to Depp's doing his weird sh--. To cap off the awfulness of it all, things fall apart at the climax. Somewhere along this final sequence, the film even finds the nerve to drop a reveal about Chlo Grace Moretz's character that is jarring and comes out of left field. In the past few years Burton and Depp's collaboration has become a gimmicky thing. It's disconcerting that SLEEPY HOLLOW - the last film by these two that I've really enjoyed - is thirteen years old. I had such high hopes for this one. I love several things about this DARK SHADOWS. But I dislike so much more about it.",2,"DARK SHADOWS - that thin line between love and hate, between flash and substance",1337558400,"05 21, 2012",2012,5409,"['Maybe', 'someday', 'Tim', 'Burton',

I faithfully rented many episodes of the original Dark Shadows (on VHS) as a late teen from a local video store, so when this came to the theaters another friend and I couldn't wait to get our seats!  To be able to watch the story unfold in less than 2 hours as opposed to over 1200 episodes is a great boon!  Who has time for soap operas anymore?  And just what is a ""local video store"" anyway? The movie certainly respins the yarn with plenty of Burton flair and creativity.  The 70's theme raised the quirky and hilarious factors up several notches.  I loved Alice Cooper's appearance as well - I was a huge fan of his as a teen.  Probably unusual in the late 80's for a 16-year-old to love Alice Cooper and an old vampire soap opera.  Also unusual - I'm one of the few Johnny Depp fans that doesn't always or automatically appreciate Burton's work (particularly his animated offerings).  I will admit Burton takes on formidable masterpieces and somehow manages to improve upon them.  He not only keeps the soul of the story intact but also deftly deepens and accentuates it.  I absolutely adore Burton's Sweeney Todd (I'd give 6 Stars for that one!) and applaud Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Sleepy Hollow, and Alice in Wonderland.  Now Dark Shadows can be added to the list of the duo's thumbs up retellings of exceptional classics.

I even hesitated to get the DVD just thinking it would be a campy version of TV cult classic. Oddly enough, even though it was campy, it worked. Depp give us his interpretation of Barnaby Collins as only Johnny Depp can, yet, he does not go over the top as one would expect with this material. Even Tim Burton seems to be toned down from his normal style.We actually have an interesting vampire story with a full background. Barnabas Collins has a tragic background that led to him being cursed forever as a vampire. Two centuries have passed and Barnabas has show up at his family estate. I enjoyed the backstory of where he has been for two centuries and the current situation of his relatives. It's a funny idea thinking one of your ancestors who happens to be a vampire shows up at your home one day.Barnabas promises not to harm any of his relatives and he is allowed to stay if he promises to help the family business thrive again.I was floored by Tim Burton's DARK SHADOWS. It's a fun movie with just the right amount of camp to make it entertaining. Lovely Michelle Pfeiffer shows her best as the current Collins matriach trying to hold a crumbling family and empire together.Helena Bonham Carter has a slow start as the resident psychiatrist for Pfeiffer's nephew, who doesn't seem so emotionally wounded as to need a full tim psychiatrist. Carter's character seems to be a throw away at first. Flamboyant and wild, her character doesn't deserve any respect from the family that has hired her, yet things changes after she knows Barnaby's secret.Poor Barnaby doesn't want to be a vampire. He just wants to be mortal. It's not his fault that he is a vampire and it sure is not his fault that several innocent locals have to give their lives to feed his hunger for blood. Here is the only dark part of the film.The Collins family has been cursed by a witch and imagine the power of a witch and a vampire ""getting it on.""Truly funny scene. The story is set in 1972 and the 1970's music is just right one. And who would expect Alice Cooper to be in a Tim Burton film, yet who better to be in a Tim Burton film than Alice Cooper?? Barnaby Collins tries to get with the times and hires that Alice Cooper ""woman"" to perform at a ""ball."" Who throws a ball in 1972 anyhow? The delightful part of the film is the confusion of two eras and the fun of someone being out of place ina  new time. If you missed Alice Cooper in the 70's, here is your chance to see him perform now. Even though 40 years has passed, they seem to be able to wipe away those years when looking at Alice.It's so much fun to watch this film if you need some fun campy entertainment!",4,CAMPY YET FUN VERSION OF A CLASSIC TV SHOW,1349654400,"10 8, 2012",2012,2784,"['am', 'fan', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'was', 'none', 'too', 'eager', 'see', 'versions', 'Barnaby', 'Collins', 'DARK', 'SHADOWS', 'even', 'hesitated', 'get', 'DVD', 'just', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'campy', 'version', 'TV', 'cult', 'classic', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'even', 'was', 'campy', 'worked', 'Depp', 'give', 'interpretation', 'Barnaby', 'Collins', 'only', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'can', 'yet', 'not', 'go', 'top', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'material', 'Even', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'be', 'toned', 'down', 'normal', 'style.We', 'actually', 'have', 'interesting', 'vampire', 'story', 'full', 'background', 'Barnabas', 'Collins', 'tragic', 'background', 'led', 'being', 'cursed', 'forever', 'vampire', 'Two', 'centuries', 'have', 'passed', 'Barnabas', 'show', 'up', 'family', 'estate', 'enjoyed', 'backstory', 'where', 'been', 'two', 'centuries', 'current', 'situation', 'relatives', 'funny', 'idea', 'thinking', 'one', 'ancestors', 'who', 'be', 'vampire', 'up', 'home', 'one', 'day.Barnabas', 'not', 'harm', 'relatives', 'allowed', 'stay', 'help', 'family', 'business', 'thrive', 'again.I', 'was', 'floored', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'DARK', 'SHADOWS', 'fun', 'movie', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'camp', 'make', 'entertaining', 'Lovely', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'best', 'current', 'Collins', 'matriach', 'trying', 'hold', 'crumbling', 'family', 'empire', 'together.Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'slow', 'start', 'resident', 'psychiatrist', 'Pfeiffer', 'nephew', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'so', 'emotionally', 'wounded', 'need', 'full', 'tim', 'psychiatrist', 'Carter', 'character', 'be', 'throw', 'away', 'first', 'Flamboyant', 'wild', 'character', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'respect', 'family', 'hired', 'yet', 'things', 'changes', 'Barnaby', 'secret.Poor', 'Barnaby', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'vampire', 'just', 'be', 'mortal', 'not', 'fault', 'vampire', 'sure', 'not', 'fault', 'several', 'innocent', 'locals', 'have', 'give', 'lives', 'feed', 'hunger', 'blood', 'Here', 'only', 'dark', 'part', 'film.The', 'Collins', 'family', 'been', 'cursed', 'witch', 'imagine', 'power', 'witch', 'vampire', 'getting', 'Truly', 'funny', 'scene', 'story', 'set', '1972', '1970', 'music', 'just', 'right', 'one', 'who', 'would', 'expect', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'be', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'film', 'who', 'better', 'be', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'film', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'Barnaby', 'Collins', 'get', 'times', 'hires', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'woman', 'perform', 'ball', 'Who', 'ball', '1972', 'anyhow', 'delightful', 'part', 'film', 'confusion', 'two', 'eras', 'fun', 'someone', 'being', 'place', 'ina', 'new', 'time', 'missed', 'Alice', 'Cooper', '70', 'here', 'chance', 'see', 'perform', 'now', 'Even', '40', 'years', 'passed', 'seem', 'be', 'able', 'wipe', 'away', 'years', 'when', 'looking', 'Alice.It', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'film', 'need', 'fun', 'campy', 'entertainment']",N/A

This is not like the soap opera nor the 1971 film based on the soap opera.  This version works because Johnny Depp brings his own dark and comical style to the role.  The result is a very entertaining film that establishes its own style.  The fact that it is set in the 1970s also adds to the camp and fun.  The film is well-shot, acted with gusto and features some new twists.  This could turn into a series but lets see what happens.  Overall, this is a hip horror film from Tim Burton.

1470698,AQ01Q3070LT29,B005LAIHKY,James McDonald,"[3, 4]","The House of Dark Shadows is Alive. Woof!I appreciate Tim Burton and Johnny Depp revitalizing Dark Shadows again for those of us middle-aged and seniors who enjoyed the original Dark Shadows soap opera (1966-71) in our younger days. Perhaps this movie will open some new doors and obtain new fans.Dark Shadows (1966-71) is still more popular than ever. The DVD CollectionsDark Shadows DVD Collection 1are selling like hot cakes.After seeingSleepy Hollow [Blu-ray] (1991) andAlice in Wonderland(2010), I then got the idea of what Tim Burton and Johnny Depp might do with Dark Shadows (2012).  It was very different and tried to be more of a comedy to honor the 1970's and the Dark Shadows story.The movie opens giving us a brief history of the Collins family and how this town of Collinsport was built up by the Collins Family. Now it's 1972 and Victoria Winters (Bella Heathcote) is at first taking a train ride and then having to hitch a ride to the Collinwood Estate. The song ""Nights in White Satin"" by Moody Blues, is played to help us get in the mood.A chained coffin is excavated deep underground from where one of Angelique's building projects will be constructed. A workman breaks the chains from around the coffin and the strong power of Barnabas Collins is unleashed. Everyone is killed at the construction site. Barnabas (Johnny Depp) has been locked away for 195 years and has an incredible thirst for human blood. You see he is a vampire. For the first time, Barnabas sees a McDonald's Restaurant and a paved road with an automobile. He makes his way back to the Collinwood Estate.This movie includes the cameo appearance of four original cast members ofDark Shadows: The Complete Original Series (Deluxe Edition)(1966-71). Jonathan Frid (""Barnabas Collins""), Kathryn Leigh Scott (""Maggie""), Lara Parker (""Angelique"") and David Selby (""Quentin"").My eyes were focused on Jonathan Frid and Kathryn Leigh Scott and although they were together, Lara Parker and David Selby went by too fast for me to see clearly. They should have let them stop and all say a few lines so they could be seen real good on film.How interesting to note that Jonathan Frid became popular with his first appearance as ""Barnabas Collins"" in Dark Shadows in 1967 and his final role was in this ""Dark Shadows"" movie. He made his exit stage left. He passed away April 14, 2012 at the age of 87.Christopher Lee also has a small role who was known in his prime as Dracula, Prince of Darkness.Dracula Prince of Darkness/The Satanic Rites of Dracula.Alice Cooper sings a couple songs from his heyday in the 1970's.Everyone has their own opinion of how a new Dark Shadows movie could be. I would like to add my 2 cents worth.I don't think it was necessary for Johnny Depp to wear the white make-up at all. He could have played ""Barnabas"" with his own natural face and skin tone and it would have worked.I didn't care for Jackie Earle Haley as ""Willie"" and thought it would have been great if the original ""Willie"" from the tv series could have played ""Willie"" again. Karlen played ""Willie"" again inHouse of Dark Shadows(1970) and ""Alex Jenkins"" inNight Of Dark Shadows(1971).They made ""Carolyn"" a girl of 15 years old in this version. I thought Chloe Grace Moretz did a wonderful job and I think we will be seeing much more of her as an actress in her adult years to come.I wanted so much to hear Michelle Pfeiffer say ""Meow"" in this film, but not even close.Jonny Lee Miller is the grandson of Bernard Lee who played ""M"" in the James Bond movies in 1962-1979.Dark Shadows was broadcast on the ABC Network before or after ""General Hospital"" in your area. In the end, in 1971, they wanted to replace it with the ""Password"" game show.Best of Password: 30 Episodes.Others played ""Barnabas"", Ben Cross in 1991 and Alec Newman in 2004.If they were to ever make a serious ""Dark Shadows"", I have wondered how soap opera actor Victor Irizarry would have faired.This 2012 movie does have its faults, but if they wanted to make a Dark Shadows Part 2, I would go see it.Johnny Depp wants to play Kolchak: The Night Stalker in a motion picture, perhaps for 2014.Kolchak - The Night StalkerJune 27, 2016 will mark the 50th Anniversary of Dark Shadows.",3,See Dark Shadows.

To have a creative pair like Johnny Depp and Tim Burton collaborate again is like getting a big gift with a bow on it. We couldn't wait to open it and see what treats we had in store! This time it's a high-concept comedy.Late in the 18th century, handsome young Barnabas Collins was the object of unwanted affection from a witch who, out of spite, turned him into a vampire, had him enclosed in a chained casket and buried for 196 years in the New England woods. After a construction crew unearths the casket and cuts the chains in 1972, he is free to vamp about and quench a powerful thirst! Along with seeing that his once-grand family estate has fallen into ruin, Barnabas is nonplussed by horseless carriages, McDonald arches and asphalt. There are endless opportunities to show that our hero is indeed, a stranger in a strange land.These folks make it fun:* Johnny Depp (&#34;Sweeney Todd&#34;) is courtly and confused. He has lost the love of his life, so he isn't above a little diversion with that seductive witch.* Michelle Pfeiffer (&#34;New Year's Eve&#34;) is the current lady of the house, trying to hold together the family traditions and a nearly bankrupt fish-packing company.* Eva Green (&#34;Perfect Sense&#34;) is that evil witch who was deter- mined to have him for all eternity, now she will settle for ruining the Collins family fortune and reputation.* Helena Bonham Carter (&#34;The King's Speech&#34;) is the tipsy doctor/ counselor/psychiatrist (I couldn't tell) who seems to live in the Collins mansion.* Bella Heathcote (''In Time&#34;) is both Barnabas' true love from his youth and the family governess in 1972.Some samples: Because they chose to set this production in 1972, the movies on the local marquee are Superfly and Deliverance. Karen Carpenter sings Top of the World while Barnabas tries to see how she got into that accursed box! He finds a lava lamp endlessly fascinating and is shocked to see that one secret chamber in the family &#34;pile&#34; is full of macram&eacute;. When Alice Cooper is hired to entertain, Barnabas takes one look and says &#34;That's the ugliest woman I've ever seen!&#34; As a red convertible approaches the Collins' mansion, the theme from A Summer Place sweeps through the theater.This is a reminder that the Depp/Burton team is alive and well, despite some third-act problems which they camouflaged with lots of CGI and blowie uppie stuff.

From time to time it has resurfaced on cable, experienced a short lived reboot but somehow just never seemed to catch on the way some other classic shows have.  This remake with big name stars offered so much promise, and happily delivered an interesting product.  It is not completely faithful to the original, but then what remake is?  It does capture lots of the quirky charm of the original if not the delightful feelings of terror, (there is never any doubt that Barnabas will triumph in this one) and many of the familiar characters and plot lines return.For those unfamiliar with the story the Collins family traveled to America from Liverpool in the 19th century to establish a fishing business in the colonies.  The family heir, Barnabas was cursed by a powerful witch, Angelique, when he scorned her for the beautiful Josette.  Barnabas, now a vampire, was imprisoned by the townspeople for 200 years when he was accidentally released in 1972.  Now Barnabas had to adapt to a greatly changed world and perhaps find a way to regain his humanity.Burton has managed to recapture some of the innocent fun of the original series, the all powerful vampire confronting his first automobile for example, and also to poke fun at the campiness of the original, the Collins are broke but they can afford to hire a live in psychiatrist, who happens to be a drunk and just a bit nuts and a governess, but don't check her references.Depp gives a wonderful performance as Barnabas, changing from an arrogant young man to a bewildered victim to the selfless lover with charming sensitivity reminiscent of Jonathan Frid's original portrayal.  Helena Bonham Carter's Dr Hoffman is delightfully campy although more sympathetic than the original is a delight.The open ending, suggesting of perhaps more to come, is in keeping with the cliffhangers that kept viewers anxiously awaiting the next installment all those years ago.",4,Let's take a trip to Collinsport,1369785600,"05 29, 2013",2013,2116,"['who', 'remember', 'dashing', 'home', 'school', 'catch', 'up', 'latest', 'happenings', 'Collinsport', 'oh', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'VCR', 'have', 'probably', 'told', 'others', 'marvelously', 'quirky', 'show', 'time', 'time', 'resurfaced', 'cable', 'experienced', 'short', 'lived', 'reboot', 'somehow', 'just', 'never', 'seemed', 'catch', 'way', 'other', 'classic', 'shows', 'have', 'remake', 'big', 'name', 'stars', 'offered', 'so', 'much', 'promise', 'happily', 'delivered', 'interesting', 'product', 'not', 'completely', 'faithful', 'original', 'then', 'what', 'remake', 'capture', 'lots', 'quirky', 'charm', 'original', 'not', 'delightful', 'feelings', 'terror', 'never', 'doubt', 'Barnabas', 'will', 'triumph', 'one', 'many', 'familiar', 'characters', 'plot', 'lines', 'return.For', 'unfamiliar', 'story', 'Collins', 'family', 'traveled', 'America', 'Liverpool', '19th', 'century', 'establish', 'fishing', 'business', 'colonies', 'family', 'heir', 'Barnabas', 'was', 'cursed', 'powerful', 'witch', 'Angelique', 'when', 'scorned', 'beautiful', 'Josette', 'Barnabas', 'now', 'vampire', 'was', 'imprisoned', 'townspeople', '200', 'years', 'when', 'was', 'accidentally', 'released', '1972', 'Now', 'Barnabas', 'had', 'adapt', 'greatly', 'changed', 'world', 'perhaps', 'find', 'way', 'regain', 'humanity.Burton', 'managed', 'recapture', 'innocent', 'fun', 'original', 'series', 'powerful', 'vampire', 'confronting', 'first', 'automobile', 'example', 'also', 'poke', 'fun', 'campiness', 'original', 'Collins', 'are', 'broke', 'can', 'afford', 'hire', 'live', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'be', 'drunk', 'just', 'bit', 'nuts', 'governess', 'do', ""n't"", 'check', 'references.Depp', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Barnabas', 'changing', 'arrogant', 'young', 'man', 'bewildered', 'victim', 'selfless', 'lover', 'charming', 'sensitivity', 'reminiscent', 'Jonathan', 'Frid', 'original', 'portrayal', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Dr', 'Hoffman', 'delightfully', 'campy', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'original', 'delight.The', 'open', 'ending', 'suggesting', 'perhaps', 'more', 'come', 'keeping', 'cliffhangers', 'kept', 'viewers', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'next', 'installment', 'years', 'ago']",N/A

A program about a family of monsters or strange characters. All I know is that when you hear that The tag-team of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp will make a film version of that popular TV show, you immediately find that it's a given. You become excited. You think of the usual gothic-like set decorations of Burton's movies, you think of his usual eerie-yet-fantasy-like-music made by his friend Danny Elfman, you think about his excellent actress-of-a-wife (Helena Bonham-Carter) that you know we'll be in it somewhere, you also think about the superb cast of well-known actors and actresses that you know wil grace the screen, Well, you think of all that and you're bound to have great expectations for this cinematic proposition.  And then, you even hear that Alice Cooper, the legendary morbid and funny singer will have a cameo. How can you not have a great time? How can they mess it up?Well, they didn't mess it up. Not exactly. But you think... all this for... that? For what, exactly? What was the goal? This movie is spectacular. It's well acted. Everything that dress it up is excellent. But what's inside? What was the point? At the level where Tim Burton is, after making a great film like ""Big Fish"", I would have expected something deeper with this ""Dark Shadows"". A second and a third layer to the story. A metaphor for something else. Like ""The Shining"" by the late Stanley Kubrick.Roger Ebert, the great critic, summed it up well: ""All dressed up but nowhere to go"". We have a great intro, not classic, but great nonetheless. Then, we follow for a good twenty minute the new and young governess, how she is introduced to the strange family and what will be her goal. Then we forget about her and she becomes a secondary character! The problems continue: you don't quite get the bizarre attraction that the witch (Eva Green) has for Depp's character, you only learn about the true nature of the daughter at about... 15 minutes until the end of the film, the father has nothing interesting to offer to the plot, the mother seems to simply stand on top of the stairs all day long, the witch simply tells the sheriff at the end that the strange family is responsible for the explosion of a warehouse and he believes her right away with only a tape recorder as proof (no she didn't use any hypnotic power), then the cops and the whole village hunts the family down, surround the Mansion and... suddenly disappear (even the cops!) even if the whole house is on fire with an epic battle of supernatural beings inside of it...All of this, plus the fact that they misused Alice Cooper (who seemed to have been set up for a bigger role), well of this makes me think that Burton simply went through the robotic moves of storytelling. The characters do this and that because they need to do it and that's it. Because the story demands it. The movie seemed to want to go somewhere and then, the same movie seemed to had forgotten about its purpose and simply went on automatic. When it ends, you're left disappointed.  Something is missing. A direction. A vision. A goal for all of this. Simply relying on the talent of Johnny Depp is not enough. The film is constantly flirting with greatness but always misses it. It's a very disappointing offering by a great director. It's not a disaster, mind you.

It's directed by Tim Burton, the creator of the current top movie,  Frankenweenie.It stars Johnny Depp and the inclusion of this director and mega-star are what make it worth a look.The story revolves around the Collins family who migrated to Maine and set up a fishing port, naming it Collinsport.When a teen, the son, Barnabas Collins (Depp) subduces the family maid, Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green). He regrets his decision and tells her he doesn't love her. That would be bad enough to tell any woman, but in this case she's a witch. She decides to put a curse on him, if he won't be with her he won't be with anyone.He falls for Josett du Pres (Bella Heathcote). Angelique puts a spell on his true love, causing Josett to leap off a cliff. Heartbroken, Barnabas follows her, but he doesn't die, he comes back as a vampire.Angelique then rials up the townspeople telling what Barnabas is, and what he's done to Josett.He is captured and buried alive, only to be dug up during construction 196 years later.

Let's face it, TV in the 70's was terrible and Dark Shadows, even though they considered it a soap, was refreshing.  All the actors do an excellent job and the movie is hilarious!  The only way they could have pulled it off was making it a comedy and the only people who could pull that off are Burton and Depp.  I loved the music throughout the movie so much that I immediately bought the soundtrack.  My kids never saw Dark Shadows and they both loved this movie.  I don't think it would have worked if they had done a serious, soapy type movie.  It would have been just another Twilight.  Who needs another Twilight!  If you grew up in the 70's, you will love the way they poked fun of that time.  It was like going down memory lane.  One of my favorite scenes is with Alice Cooper.

What keeps the movie from being a complete disaster is the director's uncanny sense of character complexity, and compelling, mind burning visuals.  This is not a film whose plotting begs for the type of analysis of Mann's ""Heat"" or Hegeland's ""L.A. Confidential.""  It's the product of an acutely artistic mind devoted to fetish, obsession, and aberrant personalities at odds with other aberrant personalities.  Lucky for us, that mind has a bizarre and enthralling sense of humor too!  Disparaging word-of-mouth, combined with a terribly misguided trailer, may have dissuaded many from seeing this little gem, but don't let it stop you from having a good time.  The movie is rife with stunning, atmospheric visuals, and strange, delightful comedy.  ""Dark Shadows"" continues Burton's fascination with ""misunderstood monsters,"" and here time and a curse have turned Barnabas Collins into an anachronism.  Fine performances by all the pincipals and supporting cast also lend a hand in tethering the rambling story to some form of logic.  I will agree with those who were disappointed the movie didn't take greater pains to polish the script and impart those fine, finishing touches that could have elevated the material beyond its pulpy origins.  But the end result is still a compelling horror fairy tale with wonderful acting, engaging humor, brilliant visuals, and offbeat comedy.

1470734,A168VXSISJWQN9,B005LAIHKY,"John D. Muir ""oldies and pies lover""","[1, 4]","Poor old Tim Burton had to deal with two of the most difficult problems a movie-maker faces when putting together a film.First, he was making a movie loosely based on an old TV series. Predictably, the reviews of many people focus on the fact that the movie is not like the TV series. People do love their memories and to see the characters and atmosphere changed from what they remember causes them anguish and leads to endless comments in which the words 'in the tv series', 'in the original Dark Shadows' or even 'in the real Dark Shadows' feature prominently.Second, he was making a comedy for the big screen. In order to get people to come to see it in theaters, it's necessary to show trailers and the trailers for a comedy have to be funny. The movie-maker is therefore forced to choose between screening some of the best jokes in the trailers in order to attract an audience and having the jokes fall flat in the film because people have already seen them or not showing the best stuff in the trailers and risking a flop because no-one thinks the film is funny enough to want to come and see it.Personally, I never saw Dark Shadows when it was a soap opera, so I had no preconceptions of what the movie 'should' contain. In that sense, I'm the ideal audience for Burton, but unfortunately for him, many people did come and see the movie hoping for a continuation of the program they recalled. However, I did see the trailers and sure enough, seeing the same jokes in the film wasn't nearly as funny as it would have been had I never seen them before. Perhaps one day an adventurous movie-maker will produce a trailer which has a completely different set of jokes in it and sell it on the basis that the film is even funnier- but then people would probably be disappointed that a joke in the trailer wasn't in the movie!I thought this was an entertaining film, based on Johnny Depp's wonderful ability to convey thoughts and emotions through subtle (yes, even in this film) changes of facial expression and tone of voice. The supporting cast was excellent, there was lots of action and the sets and special effects were, as always in Tim Burton movies, outstanding. It's not a film I'd watch over and over, but it certainly wasn't a disappointment. Try and watch it without comparing it with the TV series and you might find you enjoy it on its own terms.",4,What's a movie-maker to do?,1338940800,"06 6, 2012",2012,2362,"['Poor', 'old', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'had', 'deal', 'two', 'most', 'difficult', 'problems', 'movie-maker', 'when', 'putting', 'together', 'film.First', 'was', 'making', 'movie', 'loosely', 'based', 'old', 'TV', 'series', 'Predictably', 'reviews', 'many', 'people', 'focus', 'fact', 'movie', 'not', 'TV', 'series', 'People', 'do', 'love', 'memories', 'see', 'characters', 'atmosphere', 'changed', 'what', 'remember', 'anguish', 'endless', 'comments', 'words', 'tv', 'series', 'original', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'even', 'real', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'feature', 'prominently.Second', 'was', 'making', 'comedy', 'big', 'screen', 'order', 'get', 'people', 'come', 'see', 'theaters', 'necessary', 'show', 'trailers', 'trailers', 'comedy', 'have', 'be', 'funny', 'movie-maker', 'therefore', 'forced', 'choose', 'screening', 'best', 'jokes', 'trailers', 'order', 'attract', 'audience', 'having', 'jokes', 'fall', 'flat', 'film', 'people', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'not', 'showing', 'best', 'stuff', 'trailers', 'risking', 'flop', 'no-one', 'thinks', 'film', 'funny', 'enough', 'want', 'come', 'see', 'it.Personally', 'never', 'saw', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'when', 'was', 'soap', 'opera', 'had', 'preconceptions', 'what', 'movie', ""'should"", 'contain', 'sense', ""'m"", 'ideal', 'audience', 'Burton', 'unfortunately', 'many', 'people', 'did', 'come', 'see', 'movie', 'hoping', 'continuation', 'program', 'recalled', 'However', 'did', 'see', 'trailers', 'sure', 'enough', 'seeing', 'same', 'jokes', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'funny', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'day', 'adventurous', 'movie-maker', 'will', 'produce', 'trailer', 'completely', 'different', 'set', 'jokes', 'sell', 'basis', 'film', 'even', 'funnier-', 'then', 'people', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed', 'joke', 'trailer', 'was', ""n't"", 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'entertaining', 'film', 'based', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'wonderful', 'ability', 'convey', 'thoughts', 'emotions', 'subtle', 'yes', 'even', 'film', 'changes', 'facial', 'expression', 'tone', 'voice', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'excellent', 'was', 'lots', 'action', 'sets', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'always', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'movies', 'outstanding', 'not', 'film', ""'d"", 'watch', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointment', 'Try', 'watch', 'comparing', 'TV', 'series', 'might', 'find', 'enjoy', 'own', 'terms']",N/A

Anywho, I went to this movie expecting nothing, and left very satisfied. Though I am not a fan of most of his movies, I cannot dispute that Johnny Depp (Barnabas Collins)is a fantastic actor. His supporting cast especially Michelle Pfeiffer (Elizabeth Collins Stoddard) , Helena Bonham Carter (Dr. Julia Hoffman) , Chlo Grace Moretz (Carolyn Stoddard) and Jackie Earle Haley (Willie Loomis) are all incredible in their own right. With the ensemble cast and the very good directing (again, though not a fan I cannot dispute Tim Burton's talents)the movie was still about Dark Shadows, something I never ever cared about. Enter Seth Grahame-Smith. The story was silly enough to make me laugh, but interesting enough to keep me engaged throughout the entire movie. Add the fact that I got to hear a couple of Alice Cooper classics and it was a very entertaining two hours. I actually thanked my wife for making me go.

1470753,A30CXBWNJ83TUG,B005LAIHKY,J. Whelan,"[26, 37]","This 2012 film is a very loose adaptation of various storylines from the cult gothic suspense soap opera DARK SHADOWS (1966-71).  In this, Tim Burton's version, the vampire Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) returns to the ancestral mansion after 200 years locked in a coffin, determined to restore the sagging family fortunes.  There are brief moments of real horror, as well as much crude fish-out-of-water humor as Barnabas tries to get used to life in 1972.  As is usual with Burton, the film is visually quite striking.At one point during the film, Barnabas asks Willie (Jackie Earl Haley), his mentally-enslaved mortal lackey, to dispose of the corpse of one of his victims.  On learning of this tragedy, Willie shrugs it off with: ""I never liked the bitch anyway.""  As one who had watched the original show, I immediately recalled that this attitude was nothing like that of the original Willie (John Karlen), who was constantly fighting against his master's mind-control, who always tried, in one way or another, to save his master's victims and prevent his killings, and who always grieved deeply when he failed.But my point is not to complain that this film is unfaithful to the old series (though it certainly is).  My point is to explain why it fails on its own terms.  The problem with Willie's attitude here is that it is not just Willie's attitude --it is everybody's.  NOBODY cares that Barnabas is an undead serial murderer.  Not Collins matriarch Elizabeth Stoddard (Michelle Pfeifer); not her teen daughter Carolyn (Chloe Moretz); not her 10-year old nephew David (Gulliver McGrath); not live-in psychiatrist Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter); not David's governess Victoria Winters (Bella Heathcote).  And it is not as though they don't find out.  The only character who tries to make an issue out of his murders is the evil witch Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green) and she is motivated not by morality, but petty revenge.Even Josette DuPres, who in the original threw herself off a cliff to escape Barnabas and avoid becoming like him, has no such motive here.  Here, she dives off the cliff for entirely different reasons.  Here, Josette's ghost entirely approves of Barnabas, and would like nothing less than to be united with him forever as an immortal undead serial murderer.Are the scriptwriter and director trying to make some kind of ironic point with all this moral obtuseness?  Not as far as I can tell.  They seem merely to project their own attitudes.  Here, Barnabas swears to Elizabeth that he would never harm family.  Unlike the original Barnabas (who for all his fine talk would not have hesitated to murder even little David) he apparently speaks the truth.  The script constantly returns to this theme of family loyalty, a virtue that apparently excuses and justifies all other crimes.  Apparently, we are expected to cheer for and root for Barnabas, even after watching him butcher a half-dozen construction workers and an entire van-full of nice young hippies.  We are then expected to nod with approval as he preaches family values and good parenting to Roger Collins (Jonny Lee Miller).  This is mafia morality.This is not vampire horror, nor even (primarily) vampire comedy.  It is vampire fantasy.  Burton assumes his audience WANT to become vampires, like Bela Swann in the TWILIGHT series.  But this vampire is no Edward Cullen: a sparkly do-gooder who never takes human blood.  He looks like a corpse (moreso even than the original Barnabas, played with suitable menace by craggy-faced Jonathan Frid) and murders without compunction.  That is why, whether you label it horror or comedy, it simply does not work.  We cannot be scared because there is no-one to root for (except the anonymous victims); we cannot laugh because it is just not funny.The main horror comes from our glimpse into the dark hearts and diseased souls of Tim Burton and Seth Grahame-Smith.

1470759,A37MH7ICH80QOX,B005LAIHKY,Kate McMurry,"[8, 14]","Tim Burton's Dark Shadows 2012 (DS12) ranks right up there for me with Mel Brooks's 1974 masterpiece,Young Frankenstein, which is a hilarious parody of Universal Studios's horror movies of the 1930's, something that DS12 does, at least indirectly, as well. I personally rank this show 4 stars for script, 5 stars for CGI special effects, 5 stars for the elaborate sets by production designer Rick Heinrichs, and 5 stars for the beautiful costumes designed by Colleen Atwood. Most of all I give 5+ stars to the actors, in particular Johnny Depp. His acting is always wonderful, but it is a real joy for anyone who loves comedy to see him in a comedic part. He is a master at subtle nuances of expression, making him outstanding as either the one delivering the comic lines, or the straight man receiving them. To me, he is the best part of this film, but it is also a great pleasure to see so many talented supporting actors in the film, especially Eva Green, whose performance is terrific as the villain, Angelique Bouchard, an evil witch.The afternoon soap opera,Dark Shadows(DSTV), on which this film is based, ran on network TV from 1966-1971. Its central character is a handsome vampire, Barnabas Collins, who was portrayed with equal parts anguish and menace by talented actor, Jonathan Frid. His central role is reprised in DS12 by Depp, who has a long, successful history with the film's director, Tim Burton (a partial list of their teamwork includes,Edward Scissorhands,Ed Wood,Sweeney Todd, Corpse Bride, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,Sleepy Hollow, andAlice in Wonderland). During the era it was broadcast, DSTV offered its audience an excitingly bizarre mishmash of vampires, witches and werewolves like nothing anyone had ever seen on TV or even in films. In their youth, both Burton and Depp were big fans of the show, and Burton claims it had a major impact on the type of films he would make later in life.DS12 does not try to repeat what DSTV accomplished but rather expands on it. In a fun homage, DS12 is set in the same era as the TV series itself, beginning in 1972, the year after DSTV ended. Burton draws on the classic American tale, Rip Van Winkle, for his plot (a story written by Washington Irving, the 19th-century author on whose work Burton based his film, Sleepy Hollow). Like poor Rip, Barnabas (Depp) is condemned to a long ""sleep."" In his case, the evil witch Angelique, in punishment for rich, 18th-century playboy Barnabas's breaking her heart, turns him into a vampire and buries him in a coffin for a sleep ten times as long as Rip's enchanted slumber in a mountain meadow. Like Rip, when Barnabas escapes his magical imprisonment, he discovers the world he knew has vanished. Instead of staid 1772 (which is also Rip's era), it is now psychedelic, disco-ridden 1972. Barnabas seeks out his ancestral home and learns that the once magnificent estate is now in ruins, and his seriously dysfunctional descendants are strongly in need of his assistance to rebuild the family fortune. They include matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeifer), her debauched brother Roger (Johnny Lee Miller), her insolent teenage daughter Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz), and Roger's unstable, young son David (Gulliver/Gully McGrath). The household also includes a meek governess, Victoria Winters (Bella Heathcote), an alcoholic caretaker, Willie (Jackie Earle Haley), a senile servant, Mrs. Johnson (Ray Shirley), and a drunken psychiatrist, Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter who, as Tim Burton's wife, is in all his movies).At its peak, DSTV enjoyed a large and loyal following of 20 million fans. It hit the airwaves immediately following the close of two successful comedic monster-movie parodies, The Munsters (1964-1966) and The Addams Family (1964-1966). However, DSTV gained far higher ratings than either of those shows and ran over twice as long, perhaps because DSTV's approach to horror was melodramatic instead of comedic.The Munsters and The Addams Family can obviously be included in the rich tradition of horror parody in motion picture form, starting as early as the 1940's with movies such as Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948), but many fans of DSTV, who regard the show with utmost seriousness, object to anyone characterizing DSTV as a monster parody. However, the stars of DSTV state that the show's attitude toward horror themes was actually, if not comedic, definitely impudent. Actor David Selby, who played Quentin in DSTV, states, ""Fans who are upset [at Burton for creating a campy parody of the show] have to remember that when we made the series, we screwed with beloved monster movies and turned them upside down! We were hardly reverent ourselves."" This sentiment is seconded by Lara Parker, who played Angelique in DSTV.Burton shows his intention to honor DSTV, not mock it, by dedicating the film to Dan Curtis, DSTV's creator who is now deceased. In addition, Burton cast many of the stars of DSTV in cameos, including Frid, who died very recently at age 87, Selby, Parker, and Kathryn Leigh Scott, who played Josette. All of these actors have been strong supporters of the film.Burton also cast 90-year-old Christopher Lee in a small part in DS12, as a nod to Lee's famous portrayal of the prototype vampire from literature,Count Dracula, in multiple movies in the 60's and 70's, the same era as DSTV.To insure he had the best writer to achieve the approach he wanted to take with this film, Burton hired best-selling novelist Seth Grahame-Smith, author ofPride and Prejudice and Zombies, to do the screenplay. The two of them have also worked together on another spoofy vampire movie, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, which is set to release within a month of this movie, in June, 2012. Burton co-produced that film, which is based on anovelof the same name by Grahame-Smith, who wrote that film's screenplay as well.",5,Hilarious parody of a 1960's TV classic,1336694400,"05 11,

I was never a fan of the Dark Shadows TV series that everyone talked about in the old days, so my review is based on this movie alone, and not on a comparison against the TV series.The movie begins in Liverpool 1760, where young Barnabas Collins departs with his upper-class family.  They start a town called Collinsport (which looks like Maine or Nova Scotia), and as it grew, they built the family estate Collinwood. Angelique, who was of a lower class, wanted Barnabas, but it was not to be, so she dabbled in black magic and caused quite a bit of trouble for the Collins family, and turned Barnabas into a vampire.Now, after being buried for 196 years, Barnabas is back!Most likely, what I just told you and more is right out of the old TV series.

I think ""Alice in Wonderland"" was one of the best movies I've seen in my whole lifetime. Loved ""Sweeney Todd,""and I generally have a very high regard for Mr. Burton's work. But this movie, comparisons with the original series aside, is just plain awful. It lacks plot, and seems to be anchored down by its attempts to make references to the original series.I guess the really frustrating thing here is if you were going to reach back to the original series for material there were at least 8000 storylines & subplots that you could have drawn from. Unfortunately Seth Graham Greene chose to disregard all of those and gave us a sophomoric script that's a combination between the TV series Dallas and the previous Burton movie Beetlejuice. Seriously, the goings-on between Angelique and Barnabas remind me of the antics and sibling rivalry between Bobby Ewing and JR Ewing. As hard as Johnny Depp tries to make the material work, he just can't.Anybody older than 12 is going to be totally annoyed by Chloe Moretz as Carolyn Stoddard. There's just absolutely nothing likable about this character and nothing in her performance to make you care one lick about what happens to her or the rest of the family. Eva Green is totally miscast as Angelique, and Michelle Pfeiffer - who is one of the finest actresses in Hollywood - seems to be completely wasted on this material. That goes double for Helena Bonham Carter.The movie does have a couple of nice moments. Watching the opening titles with Victoria Winters riding a train into Collinwood, set to the Moody Blues ""Nights in White Satin""was sort of breathtaking. And surprisingly, Jackie Earle Haley as Willie Loomis is the bright spot in this mess of a movie. He truly is funny and got some belly laughs... more than once.I don't know who to be madder at. Seth Graham Greene, or Tim Burton. But I waited 50 years for someone to do a decent treatment of Dark Shadows, and I guess I'll have to wait a little while longer. No one seems to have figured out that one of the reasons the original series worked is there were always two story lines going at the same time. It never was all about Barnabas Collins. There was Elizabeth Stoddard and Jason Maguire. And then there was Barnabas and Maggie Evans. The interplay between the two story lines is what made the series so interesting. In the 1700s it was Barnabas and Angelique, and Vicky and Peter Bradford, and I can go on. Etc. etc.They used the excuse that they needed to update the story for modern audience. I am insulted.

But things went down hill fast for me once the silly comedy started kicking in.I'm a huge Dark Shadows fan and I was hoping for something on the more darker, mysterious side. Heck, I would of even excepted dry humour here and there. But, leave it to good ol' Tim Burton to upstage the classic storyline with his usual flamboyant style of gay candy art and silly hijinks. Needless to say, I was far from impressed with Edward Scissorhands.Why, at the very beginning of the movie, before the opening credits, do they have the brief chapter,(that explains Barnabas's tragic life), be so dark and chilling, and then later, flip it over like a hot pancake and turn into a hot mess of a joke? It just makes no sense to me.The sex scene between Barnabas and Angelique (flying around the office as they rip each other's clothes off, destroying all the furniture) was just way 'too over the top'. It came off as a 'Naked Gun' parody. Not only that, we just saw (!!) the same exact scene (though, left more to the imagination) in the latest, Twilight movie. (Where Edward and Bella make love on their honeymoon, leaving the room destroyed.) Both films came out around the same time. Didn't anyone notice, in Hollywood, that the joke had just been done?And don't get me started on Alice Cooper singing under a disco ball during the big party scene. Talk about the final nail in the coffin. If I wanted to watch a vampire movie with a funny disco scene, I'd rather be watching Jim Carrey and Lauren Hutton in, 'Once Bitten' dancing to the tune of, ""Hands off! He belongs to me!"" Now that's what I call, a really funny scene. And, hot, too. (the dance scene in 'Fright Night' with Chris Sarandon and Amanda Bearse, was cool, too!)But,wait! There IS something that I liked very much about the Dark Shadows movie. The opening credits! Of all things! Go figure.I love the song, 'Nights in White Satin' performed by The Moody Blues, which plays during Vicki's train ride to Collinwood. Oh-My-God! It's so neat! I actually went to the movies, twice, just to 'experience' this scene again.It was a real 'goose bumpy' moment for me. For days, I couldn't get the movie's opening out of my head. It's really a great choice song for such a perfect, somber opening. Especially once we go inside the train to meet Victoria Winters, who looks pale and slightly nervous. (that's when the song begins to, quietly whistle, in the background) Aaah! Very nice. Someone was really on the ball here; I love how the music just seems to, float along, with the train as it traveles through the open valley ways. Incredible. Magical. Dreamlike, and, kinda scary. That's the tone that I wished the movie would of stayed with. But,...if you like tongue in cheek horror movies like 'Death Becomes Her','Eight legged freaks' 'My Demon Lover' 'The Vampire Killers' 'Haunted Honeymoon' and 'Love at First Bite', you'll probably enjoy this. Especially if you don't like your horror, strait up and raw. Like I do.So, I give 'Dark Shadows' two stars. Mostly because of the opening credits over the train ride, and, Michelle Pfeiffer. She's always a pleasure to watch. She is so hot in Grease 2, it's not even funny!And, in the meantime, I love you Grayson Hall, and miss you!

1470770,AEL6AD2AL2UX8,B005LAIHKY,"Kevin ""Revolution""","[7, 18]","I was a big fan of the Dark Shadows TV series and was excited to hear that Tim Burton was going to make the movie.  I thought if anyone can create the murky dark atmosphere of the TV series it would be him.  I along with others was disappointed to see the corny trailer that came out.  A comedy?  What?  Sacrilege. I decided to see the movie anyway making my peace with the fact that this was not going to be like the TV show.  I was able to separate the two and just look at it as its own piece and its own movie.Luckily by doing that, I found that I was entertained with this film and enjoyed every minute of it.  I suppose it did what its job was meant to do.  Entertain.  I also found that it wasn't nearly as comedic as they made it out to be with the trailer.  It was darker and more gothic and interesting.  The mood as in any Tim Burton movie was offbeat and not of this world.  Johnny Depp who did not look like himself made a great vampire coming to terms with being in the wrong century.  Michelle Pfeiffer was stunning and as always lit up the screen with her ferocious take on the reclusive dark matriarch.  The two surprises were Eva Green as Angelique Bouchard and Chloe Moretz who played Carolyn Stoddard. They both leapt gleefully into their characters prompting me to wonder who those two actors I'd never heard of were.Critiquing this movie as its own piece without comparing it to the TV series or Tim Burton's earlier work, I thought it was fun and entertaining.  Comparing it to the TV series or Burton's older films, then no it doesn't hold a candle and not his best work.  It was however better than Planet of the Apes, Big Fish, Alice in Wonderland and maybe even Charlie & the Chocolate Factory.  Sweeney Todd was a great movie, but I can only take so much of a movie where people are singing throughout it.  As great as Sweeney Todd was, I'm more likely to throw this Dark Shadows on instead.

This is how the story goes: In the year 1752, Joshua and Naomi Collins, with young son Barnabas, set sail from Liverpool, England to start a new life in America. But even an ocean was not enough to escape the mysterious curse that has plagued their family. Two decades pass and Barnabas has the world at his feet -- or at least the town of Collinsport, Maine. The master of Collinwood Manor, Barnabas is rich, powerful and an inveterate playboy...until he makes the grave mistake of breaking the heart of Angelique Bouchard. A witch, in every sense of the word, Angelique dooms him to a fate worse than death: turning him into a vampire, and then burying him alive.Two centuries later, Barnabas is inadvertently freed from his tomb and emerges into the very changed world of 1972. He returns to Collinwood Manor to find that his once-grand estate has fallen into ruin. The dysfunctional remnants of the Collins family have fared little better, each harboring their own dark secrets. Matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard has called upon live-in psychiatrist, Dr. Julia Hoffman, to help with her family troubles.Also residing in the manor is Elizabeth's ne'er-do-well brother, Roger Collins; her rebellious teenage daughter Carolyn Stoddard; and Roger's precocious 10-year-old son, David Collins.The cast led by Johnny Depp (as Barnabas, who also produced) & Michelle Pfeiffer (as Elizabeth) is great. The directing by Tim Burton is great. The story (based on Dan Curtis' TV series) by John August & Seth Grahame-Smith & the screenplay (based on Dan Curtis' TV series) by Grahame-Smith is great.The music by Danny Elfman is great. The cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel is great. The film editing by Chris Lebenzon (who also executive produced) is great. The casting by Susie Figgis is great. The production design by Rick Heinrichs is great. The art direction by Neal Callow, Dean Clegg, Christian Huband, Jason Knox-Johnston, Chris Lowe & Phil Sims is great. The set decoration by John Bush is great. The costume design by Colleen Atwood is great. The make-up effects (prosthetic & regular) by Charlie Hounslow, Duncan Jarman, Tamsin Dorling, Sophia Knight, Leonard MacDonald & Debbi Salmon (also hair stylist) are great. The stunts coordinated by Eunice Huthart & fights coordinated by James Grogan are great. The special effects supervised by Joss Williams & coordinated by Victoria Stokes are great. The visual effects supervised by Angus Bickerton & coordinated by Samantha Fazackerley, Charlotte Frances, Holly Gosnell (set supervisor) is great.This is a great blend of horror-comedy that keeps you thinking and entertained at the same time. This is another great pairing (the eighth) of Johnny Depp & Tim Burton, the fifth pairing of Depp, Burton & Burton's wife, Helena Bonham Carter (who plays Dr. Hoffman, also in her seventh pairing with Burton), as well. This is another great pairing of frequent Burton collaborators, as well, and an interesting reteaming as well, with Burton & Pfeiffer after nearly 20 years. This is also an interesting vampire film that is a little bit different from other vampire films that have been made that are out there, as well.",5,"""Dark Shadows"" is great!",1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,3192,"['Dark', 'Shadows', 'great', 'how', 'story', 'year', '1752', 'Joshua', 'Naomi', 'Collins', 'young', 'son', 'Barnabas', 'set', 'sail', 'Liverpool', 'England', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'America', 'even', 'ocean', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'escape', 'mysterious', 'curse', 'plagued', 'family', 'Two', 'decades', 'pass', 'Barnabas', 'world', 'feet', 'least', 'town', 'Collinsport', 'Maine', 'master', 'Collinwood', 'Manor', 'Barnabas', 'rich', 'powerful', 'inveterate', 'playboy', 'grave', 'mistake', 'breaking', 'heart', 'Angelique', 'Bouchard', 'A', 'witch', 'sense', 'word', 'Angelique', 'fate', 'worse', 'death', 'turning', 'vampire', 'then', 'burying', 'alive.Two', 'centuries', 'later', 'Barnabas', 'inadvertently', 'freed', 'tomb', 'very', 'changed', 'world', '1972', 'Collinwood', 'Manor', 'find', 'once-grand', 'estate', 'fallen', 'ruin', 'dysfunctional', 'remnants', 'Collins', 'family', 'have', 'fared', 'little', 'better', 'harboring', 'own', 'dark', 'secrets', 'Matriarch', 'Elizabeth', 'Collins', 'Stoddard', 'called', 'live-in', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'Julia', 'Hoffman', 'help', 'family', 'troubles.Also', 'residing', 'manor', 'Elizabeth', ""ne'er-do-well"", 'brother', 'Roger', 'Collins', 'rebellious', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Carolyn', 'Stoddard', 'Roger', 'precocious', '10-year-old', 'son', 'David', 'Collins.The', 'cast', 'led', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Barnabas', 'who', 'also', 'produced', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'Elizabeth', 'great', 'directing', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'great', 'story', 'based', 'Dan', 'Curtis', 'TV', 'series', 'John', 'August', 'Seth', 'Grahame-Smith', 'screenplay', 'based', 'Dan', 'Curtis', 'TV', 'series', 'Grahame-Smith', 'great.The', 'music', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'great', 'cinematography', 'Bruno', 'Delbonnel', 'great', 'film', 'editing', 'Chris', 'Lebenzon', 'who', 'also', 'executive', 'produced', 'great', 'casting', 'Susie', 'Figgis', 'great', 'production', 'design', 'Rick', 'Heinrichs', 'great', 'art', 'direction', 'Neal', 'Callow', 'Dean', 'Clegg', 'Christian', 'Huband', 'Jason', 'Knox-Johnston', 'Chris', 'Lowe', 'Phil', 'Sims', 'great', 'set', 'decoration', 'John', 'Bush', 'great', 'costume', 'design', 'Colleen', 'Atwood', 'great', 'make-up', 'effects', 'prosthetic', 'regular', 'Charlie', 'Hounslow', 'Duncan', 'Jarman', 'Tamsin', 'Dorling', 'Sophia', 'Knight', 'Leonard', 'MacDonald', 'Debbi', 'Salmon', 'also', 'hair', 'stylist', 'are', 'great', 'stunts', 'coordinated', 'Eunice', 'Huthart', 'fights', 'coordinated', 'James', 'Grogan', 'are', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'supervised', 'Joss', 'Williams', 'coordinated', 'Victoria', 'Stokes', 'are', 'great', 'visual', 'effects', 'supervised', 'Angus', 'Bickerton', 'coordinated', 'Samantha', 'Fazackerley', 'Charlotte', 'Frances', 'Holly', 'Gosnell', 'set', 'supervisor', 'great.This', 'great', 'blend', 'horror-comedy', 'thinking', 'entertained', 'same', 'time', 'great', 'pairing', 'eighth', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'fifth', 'pairing', 'Depp', 'Burton', 'Burton', 'wife', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'who', 'Dr.', 'Hoffman', 'also', 'seventh', 'pairing', 'Burton', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'pairing', 'frequent', 'Burton', 'collaborators', 'as', 'well', 'interesting', 'reteaming', 'as', 'well', 'Burton', 'Pfeiffer', 'nearly', '20', 'years', 'also', 'interesting', 'vampire', 'film', 'little', 'bit', 'different', 'other', 'vampire', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'are', 'there', 'well']",N/A

Taken the dark and the weird and melded them together in a creepy retelling of this old 1960's TV Soap Opera.In 1966  Dark Shadows which recently lost its star Jonathan Frid  who played the original Barnabus Collins became the most popular daytime soap opera of its kind. Running for almost seven years, it became the staple of modern vampires as seen in the contemporary world.Burton takes the reigns and uses light splashes of blood, super-human abilities....and hypnotic control and gives them to Johnny Depp (Pirates of the Caribbean, Alice In Wonderland, Neverland) who takes this character to creepy levels and beyond. His performance was amazing to watch. When he is on screen you can' take your eyes of him. Given a back story 200 years old...he tries to adjust to he year 1972....as well as anyone could coming from the year 1789.Screenwriter Seth Jared Greenberg (Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter) took a long-winded approach to lead the audience through a slow beginning and  little lengthy middle to then really spice up action, magical effects with an incredibly bizarre characters...you would never want to meet.Michelle Pfieffer (Hairspray, Scarface, Batman Returns), turns in a stoic performance as the Lady of the Collins house with two very different Collins children  - played by Gulliver McGrath (Hugo, Lincoln) as the gried stricken son and the daughter played by Chloe Grace Moretz (500 Days of Summer, Hugo, Kick Ass) with a surprise secret!The contrasting and memorable performance of a physiologist is played extremely creatively (if somewhat held back) by Mrs. Burton herself, Helena Bonham Carter (Harry Potter, Alice In Wonderland, The Corpse Bride). She is wickedly weird.The movie is sprinkled with great character acting by the unique physical appearance of the creepy groundskeeper played by Jack Earl Haley (Watchman, Shutter Island, Loosin' It) and an obnoxious and annoying brother of Michelle Pfieffer played by Jonny Lee Miller (Trainspotting, Hackers).Now the plot revolves around a sadistic, cruel and evil villainess that only the issue of LOVE could be the cause and the cure of this Collinsville Curse that exists....and has existed for two centuries. This villain  is seductively play by Eva Green (Casino Royale, The Golden Compass) with powers equal to - and in some parts - exceeding the vampire Barnabus Collins himself(Depp).Besides Johnny Depps performance and that of Ms. Green's the best thing in the movie was the choices of the song hits on the year 1972. They are sewn in extremely well and you'll find yourself singing the tunes as you go. Not to take away from master composer himself, Danny Elfman (Batman, Milk, Real Steel) who compliments the vampires, action and enormous powers that flair out of these colorful characters.I think it's a fun film with good performances by at least two of the cast and contains a great soundtrack. It does move slow at times and a lot of the story is catch up. I would have asked for more of the fish-out-of-water side of Depp in the year 1972 and less of the backstory of the evil villainess!If you are a Depp or Burton fan - you'll love it. Bonham Carter is not allowed to expand much and if slow is your speed this is the film for you. Otherwise...you could wait for the video. I liked it more than I disliked it. You have to decide for yourself.",3,"Johnny Depp Masterfully Makes You Quiver, Again - The Movie - Not So Much!",1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,3460,"['MOVIE', 'REVIEW', '32', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'Macabre', 'genre', 'director', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'done', 'again', 'Taken', 'dark', 'weird', 'melded', 'together', 'creepy', 'retelling', 'old', '1960', 'TV', 'Soap', 'Opera.In', '1966', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'recently', 'lost', 'star', 'Jonathan', 'Frid', 'who', 'played', 'original', 'Barnabus', 'Collins', 'became', 'most', 'popular', 'daytime', 'soap', 'opera', 'kind', 'Running', 'almost', 'seven', 'years', 'became', 'staple', 'modern', 'vampires', 'seen', 'contemporary', 'world.Burton', 'reigns', 'uses', 'light', 'splashes', 'blood', 'super-human', 'abilities', '.and', 'hypnotic', 'control', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'Neverland', 'who', 'character', 'creepy', 'levels', 'performance', 'was', 'amazing', 'watch', 'When', 'screen', 'can', 'take', 'eyes', 'Given', 'back', 'story', '200', 'years', 'old', 'adjust', 'year', '1972', '.as', 'well', 'anyone', 'could', 'coming', 'year', '1789.Screenwriter', 'Seth', 'Jared', 'Greenberg', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', 'took', 'long-winded', 'approach', 'lead', 'audience', 'slow', 'beginning', 'little', 'lengthy', 'middle', 'then', 'really', 'spice', 'up', 'action', 'magical', 'effects', 'incredibly', 'bizarre', 'characters', 'would', 'never', 'want', 'meet.Michelle', 'Pfieffer', 'Hairspray', 'Scarface', 'Batman', 'Returns', 'stoic', 'performance', 'Lady', 'Collins', 'house', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'Collins', 'children', 'played', 'Gulliver', 'McGrath', 'Hugo', 'Lincoln', 'gried', 'stricken', 'son', 'daughter', 'played', 'Chloe', 'Grace', 'Moretz', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'Hugo', 'Kick', 'Ass', 'surprise', 'secret', 'contrasting', 'memorable', 'performance', 'physiologist', 'played', 'extremely', 'creatively', 'somewhat', 'held', 'back', 'Mrs.', 'Burton', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'Corpse', 'Bride', 'wickedly', 'weird.The', 'movie', 'sprinkled', 'great', 'character', 'acting', 'unique', 'physical', 'appearance', 'creepy', 'groundskeeper', 'played', 'Jack', 'Earl', 'Haley', 'Watchman', 'Shutter', 'Island', 'Loosin', 'obnoxious', 'annoying', 'brother', 'Michelle', 'Pfieffer', 'played', 'Jonny', 'Lee', 'Miller', 'Trainspotting', 'Hackers', '.Now', 'plot', 'around', 'sadistic', 'cruel', 'evil', 'villainess', 'only', 'issue', 'LOVE', 'could', 'be', 'cause', 'cure', 'Collinsville', 'Curse', '.and', 'existed', 'two', 'centuries', 'villain', 'seductively', 'play', 'Eva', 'Green', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'powers', 'equal', 'parts', 'exceeding', 'vampire', 'Barnabus', 'Collins', 'Depp', 'Johnny', 'Depps', 'performance', 'Ms.', 'Green', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'was', 'choices', 'song', 'year', '1972', 'are', 'sewn', 'extremely', 'well', ""'ll"", 'find', 'singing', 'tunes', 'go', 'Not', 'take', 'away', 'master', 'composer', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'Batman', 'Milk', 'Real', 'Steel', 'who', 'vampires', 'action', 'enormous', 'powers', 'flair', 'colorful', 'characters.I', 'think', 'fun', 'film', 'good', 'performances', 'least', 'two', 'cast', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'move', 'slow', 'times', 'lot', 'story', 'catch', 'would', 'have', 'asked', 'more', 'fish-out-of-water', 'side', 'Depp', 'year', '1972', 'less', 'backstory', 'evil', 'villainess', 'are', 'Depp', 'Burton', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'love', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'not', 'allowed', 'expand', 'much', 'slow', 'speed', 'film', 'Otherwise', 'could', 'wait', 'video', 'liked', 'more', 'disliked', 'have', 'decide']",N/A

1470809,A24TSV6PUYAWYQ,B005LAIHKY,"Los conquistadores del gato! ""The cat conquerors""","[11, 24]","A man of privilege Barnabas Collins develops feelings for a woman whom is of what would be considered a working class or a poor and undesirable type.  While Barnabas never treats Angelique any differently than anyone else just because of her social status, he never truly loves Angelique.  Barnabas then later meets Josette Dupres whom is the true love of his life.  While Barnabas was also still involved with Angelique, he decides to end his relationship with her and stay true to Josette as that is whom he truly loves.  Other things transpire and after the Death of both of his parents, Barnabas develops a strong interest in Dark Magic in hopes of finding answers.  The woman, whom he had previously been involved with and no longer cares for, Angelique Bouchard, will not leave Barnabas alone.  Obsessed with Barnabas and not wanting to accept he has moved on, Angelique curses Barnabas and he is imprisoned from the 1700's until 1972.  Barnabas is finally able to escape his prison, and returns to his former home which is now inhabited by his present day relatives.  Barnabas has a difficult time adjusting to modern times as well as getting to know his family whom was not alive at the time he was imprisoned.  Angelique is not only still alive, but is also doing remarkably well and soon seeks out Barnabas whom is not very happy at all to see her, let alone know that she is actually still alive.  Angelique is still very much in love with Barnabas as he is slowly developing a new love interest with Victoria Winters.  To further complicate matters, Victoria bears an uncanny resemblance to Barnabas's true love Josette Dupres.  Barnabas decides as his new purpose in life, he is going to restore his family's name and business to what they once were.  However, the chief competitor in the business is none other than Angelique - Barnabas's former lover and long time nemesis.  Further developments and events follow and ultimately end with a climatic showdown which also throws in a few twists not hinted at earlier in the movie.I must say that first I am not very familiar with the Original TV series, so for some of the people whom have reviewed the movie and were disappointed I am sorry to hear you feel that way.  However as someone, whom had no knowledge of the back story or much else at all for that matter about Dark Shadows, I really loved the movie very much and I am looking forward to the Bluray.  I loved the way the story was told from this perspective, as a movie by itself (if you do not take any of the previous Dark Shadows material into account....) it was great!  There are times when the movie seems to slow down but overall I loved how the odd jokes and the sarcasm were presented in the way that only Johnny Depp can present them!  I don't want to give anything away other than if you have not seen this movie, what are you waiting for?  Pre-Order this like yesterday!  The movie will be even better than it was in the theater!I cannot wait to see what additional footage was left out of the original cut!  For the people that saw the movie and hated it because they were longtime Dark Shadows fans - Perhaps you may like the movie more with the extra footage?  I want to see to see how holes in the story onscreen are filled in and other elements of the film are expanded upon.I also want to say that I am not very familiar with Eva Green (Angelique Bouchard); however she was amazing in her role and bought the character to life. It was great to see Chloe Moretz (Carolyn Stoddard) again who will only continue to become a bigger star in the future.  One of the reasons I was interested in this movie was Johnny Depp whom of course portrays Barnabas Collins.  That's not to say the movie is shabby or anything of the sort, I was just not familiar with the Dark Shadows Franchise in anything other than the name.Helena Bonham Carter (Dr. Julia Hoffman), Michelle Pfeiffer - (Elizabeth Collins Stoddard), and Jackie Earle Haley (Willie Loomis) were all great casting choices as well as of course Bella Heathcote  (Victoria Winters/Josette Dupres).  The only other part I can think of that was of more than just a passing mention would be that of David Collins played by Gulliver McGrath.  The one role I was not impressed much at all with was that of Roger Collins played by Johnny Lee Miller whom is a solid actor though this was just not his movie.I loved the movie, a sequel would be nice...though Depp may be tied up doing the next two Pirates Of The Caribbean movies (which are going to be filmed simultaneously and then released separately).So Pre-order Dark Shadows already! Or at the least, rent this on Amazon as soon as its put up for streaming and then buy it when you can.....but do whatever you can to see it.  It's great!",5,A Great Movie!,1345334400,"08 19, 2012",2012,4772,"['man', 'privilege', 'Barnabas', 'Collins', 'feelings', 'woman', 'whom', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'working', 'class',

1470824,A79U01AE98EV8,B005LAIHKY,MACLEAR,"[3, 7]","Surely no director with so much talent has wasted it on the drivel Tim Burton has.  For the past ten or so years he has done everything in his limited power to demonstrate his total lack of imagination.  Yes.  The man noted for his unorthodox style hasn't the imagination to make a movie unmarred by lack of structure, by characters who are hopelessly one dimensional, by stories that are absurd in the pejorative sense of the word (rather than the Beckettian sense).  The only film he has made that might be considered great is ""Ed Wood"" which is ironic as Burton may soon be closely identified with that talentless hack.  His ""Alice"" film was an insult leveled against not only Lewis Carroll's fertile imagination, but also of every child who wondered at the story of Alice's adventures.""Dark Shadows"" is a abortive remake of ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Sleepy Hollow"".  You'd think by now Burton would have made more than one film that might join the ranks of his contemporaries such as Tarentino, the Coen Brothers, or Wes Anderson to name a few.  The Coens' also are stylists, but not at the expense of substance.  They mine every genre for all they're worth, sometimes mixing them superbly as in their masterpieces ""Raising Arizona"" and ""Fargo"".  Burton simply has nothing to say cinematically (or any other way for that matter) in this he is akin to Depalma who has never had an original thought, cinematic or otherwise, instead preferring to wallow in interring ideas that worked when he was still cutting his teeth.  Burton's once lauded ""Batman"" films are horribly dated.  Style alone can take one only so far - one gets the feeling he has no feeling for the craft to which he has devoted his life.  Sample dialogue: ""I'm a werewolf.  Deal with it.""  And it boasts a montage while Karen Carpenter warbles ""Top of The World""Avoid this film.

1470825,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B005LAIHKY,MadMacs,"[20, 29]","***Spoiler Warning***Dreadful. Now that's a word I don't hear or use very often. But dang, it's the most appropriate term for this silly train wreck of a flick.Admittedly, I'm not a fan of auteur director Tim Burton. But this, this would be bad regardless of whatever name was attached to it. Had he adopted a pseudonym like say, John Smith, I would be here saying that Director Smith had pooped out a turd and called it a movie.Not sure if Hollywood has yet figured out that Burton's visionary talent is monochromatic astigmatism with a dash of delusional creativity. Like a street performer - while initially fascinating and providing a momentary diversion, quickly loses steam as one gets bored by the repetitive drone. You've seen it all before. The man is the definition of a one-string banjo with a bucket of white face paint and mobile airbrush on the side.Depp's vampire-outside-his-own-time bit quickly grows tiresome and honestly doesn't make the best use of the material. There were a multitude of lost opportunities as Burton went for the cheap easy laughs, failing to exploit anachronisms to their maximum potential. Sadly, there were only a few moments of pure cleverness. One of the best as Barnabus makes a quiet sideways inquiry on meeting the young Collins daughter Carolyn for the first time, to which she replies in a wonderful deadpan, ""I think he called me a hooker."" Unfortunate that there weren't more of those.The one performance I found enjoyable - Eva Green. To me, she struck the right balance of zesty campiness, sincere wickedness and forlorn love warped into vicious jealousy. Previously she's always taken the quiet, often low-key approach to her characterizations. But as witch Angelique, the funny comedienne emerged from her more established cool sensual persona. Fun and tasty, I like to think this role will broaden her appeal to differing filmmakers.The worst aspect of this production was that the entire film lacked cohesiveness. Various components patched together with no sense of a greater theme; scenes and cast that were disconnected and unfinished.Examples of script incongruity:- Victoria states she was always returning to Collinswood and back to Barnabas. When does she ""always return"" to the township? It's never explained. And that when she returns, it's always to him. Wasn't he stuck in a coffin all her life? So... &lt;shrug>- Another quagmire: How many ghosts inhabit the manor? Two apparently. There's the original Josette who haunts her modern incarnation Victoria. Then suddenly, and conveniently without any explanation, young David's mother appears in a pathetic deus ex machina cheat to save the day. Confusingly, neither interacts with the other. 'Natch, since we're only introduced to the other spirit toward the very end of the film.- Carolyn's lycanthropy. No seeming point to this other than as a hurried prop thrown into this weak monster bash. All that was missing was ol' Bolt Neck.Stuff like this irks since we're left trying to make sense out of the senseless; pressed to make our own mental jigsaw by forcing the various pieces to fit.Lack of directorial oversight and ignoring simple internal story logic.Mostly, I feel bad for the hardcore Dark Shadows fans. Can't begin to imagine their disappointment, frustration and anger. And in truth, if I were part of any iconic cultural heritage, and the name Tim Burton was suddenly mentioned in conversation, I'd be very, very scared. The man has the unfortunate black thumb of moviemakers looking to plumb the cultural bank.

Its visually appealing. The casting isn't bad. But the plot and story are lame.Vampire Barnabas Collins shows up after 200 years and encounters his 1970s era degenerate descendents. He proceeds to fix everything up in everyone's lives and then does battle with a witch. Too much of the film was spent on witch-related melodrama and action. Too little was spent on fixing up the family.The visual jokes at Michael Jackson's expense were obvious but well done.But they missed alot of good material in the original premise. Elizabeth Stoddard in the original had killed her husband and refused afterward to leave the house for years. In the film, she has no problems whatsoever. The original premise where a treasure-hunting Willy Loomis unearths the vampire was better. Roger and David they got generally right aside from having the ghosts david sees be only his mother. Carloine, aside from one thing done at the end, was probably an improvement on the original. Victoria Winters, for whatever reasons, comes across in the film as a shallow non-entity. They don't really use her at all. Dr. Julia Hoffman as a drunk was good in some scenes as a drunk, but then written off in a rather shallow way as a one-note joke.Everything to do with Angelique is terrible. All the fishing industry competition stuff (Angel Bay) was a waste of time. The character is reduced to a obsessed stalker. Eva Green does the best she can with what she is given. But its not much.Jackie Earl Haley turns in a good character preformance as Willie Loomis. Michelle Pfeiffer turns in a good performance in spite of the role not giving her all that much to do. Depp is good to a point but he is somewhat playing his stock character rather than doing anything interesting.For all the good little bits in the film, they somehow missed the premise of the original material altogether.

I have been a huge Tim Burton fan since the beginning, even using his work for a final in my film class. After all who can go wrong with a guy whose dream was to be the guy in the Godzilla suit!Sadly, his movies of late are missing an element that made his movies unique and quirky masterpieces. It's almost as if a child has gotten bored with his favorite toy, yet still goes through the motions in playing with it.This movie is DULL! Lackluster performances by ALL the actors/actresses involved. Every character is flat out boring, and gives you absolutely no reason to become invested in them. The humor is tired, unoriginal and just not humorous. The beloved quirkiness of Burton's previous films like Edward Scissorhands (one of the best films ever) is absent. The story-line has the same affect of fingernails on a chalkboard. The bulk of the characters have zero purpose.Quite frankly, Burton needs to get over his man-crush with Johnny Depp. His movies are beginning to prove that directors shouldn't direct their significant others. It's time to bury the Burton/Depp/Bonham-Carter triangle. It's becoming old and too comfortable...with each providing a ""lazy"" product. What previous chemistry there was has evaporated and these great talents are going to waste.There really isn't anything good about this film.

Burton makes the 'dark' shine so brightly in all of his films, which includeBatman,Edward Scissorhands: 10th Anniversary,Sleepy Hollow, and a personal favorite,Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.  Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter (Burton's spouse) are often cast in Burton's films and 2012'sDark Shadowsis no different.  While Depp and Carter are superb as usual in Dark Shadows, it is the film itself that is an ambitious remake that falls short.  To Dark Shadows's credit, there are many good pieces (the ambitious and potential), but those pieces come off as scattered and lacking the same oomph as most Tim Burton films do.  Dark Shadows is funny given its role as a dark comedy, but it is also 'silly,' which makes the laughs a bit temporary and superficial.The plot is as follows: Barnabas Collins (Depp), a member of a family of prominent fishermen/fish marketers, is the protagonist of the story. After his lover jumps to her death after being put under a spell by jealous witch Angelique (Eva Green).  Angelique ultimately curses Barnabas and the Collins family making Barnabas a vampire who is ultimately buried alive.  Two centuries later, Barnabas's coffin is dug up and he is alive in full fledge vampire form.  He returns to his mansion to restore the family fishing business and try to undo Angelique's fishing business, which became the standard after Angelique turns the town against the descendants/remaining Collins family.  Victoria, a non-family members comes to the mansion to serve as a governess for David Collins (Gully McGrath) whose mother was the victim of Angelique's witchcraft.  Barnabas Collins falls for Victoria and ultimately saves her from Angelique's witchcraft.Ultimately, the plot is a bit 'all over the place' much like the overall film. It is scattered and over-ambitious. Writers do well by making the beginning and end of the film connect, but some of the inner plot is questionable.  As stated earlier, there is enough comical moments to make Dark Shadows enjoyable for a while.  However, the ludicrousness and silliness sometimes supersede the comical nature, which ultimately hurts this Tim Burton offering. The ambitious elements furthermore are not enough to carry this film.",2,"Ambitious, But Falls Short",1351209600,"10 26, 2012",2012,2305,"['First', 'foremost', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'one', 'favorite', 'directors', 'Burton', ""'dark"", 'shine', 'so', 'brightly', 'films', 'includeBatman', 'Edward', '10th', 'Anniversary', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'Demon', 'Barber', 'Fleet', 'Street', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Burton', 'spouse', 'are', 'often', 'cast', 'Burton', 'films', ""2012'sDark"", 'Shadowsis', 'different', 'Depp', 'Carter', 'are', 'superb', 'usual', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'film', 'ambitious', 'remake', 'short', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'credit', 'are', 'many', 'good', 'pieces', 'ambitious', 'potential', 'pieces', 'come', 'off', 'scattered', 'lacking', 'same', 'oomph', 'most', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'films', 'do', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'funny', 'given', 'role', 'dark', 'comedy', 'also', ""'silly"", 'laughs', 'bit', 'temporary', 'superficial.The', 'plot', 'Barnabas', 'Collins', 'Depp', 'member', 'family', 'prominent', 'fishermen/fish', 'marketers', 'protagonist', 'story', 'lover', 'jumps', 'death', 'being', 'put', 'spell', 'jealous', 'witch', 'Angelique', 'Eva', 'Green', 'Angelique', 'ultimately', 'Barnabas', 'Collins', 'family', 'making', 'Barnabas', 'vampire', 'who', 'ultimately', 'buried', 'alive', 'Two', 'centuries', 'later', 'Barnabas', 'coffin', 'dug', 'up', 'alive', 'full', 'fledge', 'vampire', 'form', 'mansion', 'restore', 'family', 'fishing', 'business', 'try', 'undo', 'Angelique', 'fishing', 'business', 'became', 'standard', 'Angelique', 'town', 'descendants/remaining', 'Collins', 'family', 'Victoria', 'non-family', 'members', 'mansion', 'serve', 'governess', 'David', 'Collins', 'Gully', 'McGrath', 'mother', 'was', 'victim', 'Angelique', 'witchcraft', 'Barnabas', 'Collins', 'Victoria', 'ultimately', 'Angelique', 'witchcraft.Ultimately', 'plot', 'bit', ""'all"", 'place', 'much', 'overall', 'film', 'scattered', 'over-ambitious', 'Writers', 'do', 'well', 'making', 'beginning', 'end', 'film', 'connect', 'inner', 'plot', 'questionable', 'stated', 'earlier', 'enough', 'comical', 'moments', 'make', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'enjoyable', 'while', 'However', 'ludicrousness', 'silliness', 'sometimes', 'supersede', 'comical', 'nature', 'ultimately', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'offering', 'ambitious', 'elements', 'furthermore', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'carry', 'film']",N/A
1470866,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B005LAIHKY,Michael Butts,"[3, 5]","Note:  Comparing this movie to the TV serial is really difficult to do since the series had more time to develop the entire Barnabas storyline.  As one of those devoted DARK SHADOWS fanatics who rushed home from school and work to watch the show, Jonathan Frid and Lara Parker are the only Barnabas and Angelique I can fully accept..and none of the subsequent remakes will ever surpass the original.With that in mind, how does Tim Burton's film stand on its own merits?  One flaw is the tone of the movie - is it a comedy or a straight-on horror flick---or is it both?  Johnny Depp starts off rather foppish and then tries being more sinister and aggressive without any real transitional event to support this change.  Bella Heathcote is a rather passive love interest; Michelle Pfeiffer is quite good as the Collins matriarch, even when she's using a shotgun against the evil Angelique; Burton unwisely restrains Jackie Earle Haley in his role as Willie, a role that would have been more effective had Willie been more uncontrolled; Eva Green chews up the scenery relentlessly but almost becomes comical; Helena Bonham Carter, Jonny Lee Miller and Chloe Jane Moritz are adequate, but their characters seem under-developed.  Burton's visuals are expectedly stunning.  While Danny Elfman's score has its moments, shame on the producers decision not to use the series' haunting theme, especially since both Burton and Depp claimed to be such faithful devotees.  The film's final battle between Depp and Green is an over-the-top CGI slugfest and its final scene between Depp and Heathcote is oh-so TWILIGHTish.  Also the cameos of series regulars Frid, Parker, Kathryn Leigh Scott and David Selby occur so quickly, there easy  to overlook...surely they deserved a bigger moment?  But I have gone back on my word not to compare???  Sorry, just had to include my feelings on those two pet peeves.I was entertained by Burton's film, but ultimately, it's a hollow victory.

No it's the half comedy and half horror concept of a beloved franchise that sank this movie. It was tim burton's biggest flop. I do like parts of this movie. The scenes with alice cooper are just great! and other scenes capture a gothic sense of dread. BUT the movie meanders off into semicomedy and not very good comedy at that. Why not make a real dark shadows movie? OH well we got the parody instead. And that's a shame.  The blu ray looks dark throughout as if filmed with gauze over the lens. This was done for atmosphere but since this is a comedy, perhaps they shouldn't have bothered.  IT's not a terrible movie though as it does feature some good scenes and the effects are great. But all killing is mostly pg rated and silly. So long term fans may want to get the real Dark shadows films on blu ray. As they exist and casual fans may like this comedy , that's not really funny.

Tresca ""Talien""","[3, 4]","Quick, which film features a child with uncertain heritage stewarded by vampires and werewolves and a war between two supernatural factions over a family's choice?  Before there was ""Twilight: Breaking Dawn,"" there was ""Dark Shadows.""Instead of Edward we have Barnabas (Johnny Depp, vamping it up), an old-school vampire in love with a pretty young thing who is played by an actress named Bella Heathcote (playing Josette du Pres).  It seems Barnabas made the mistake of having an affair with the family's maid, Angelique Buouchard (Eva Green) who also happens to be a witch.  She uses witchcraft to push Josette to suicide and curses Barnabas with vampirism.Fast forward to the 1970s and Barnabas is unearthed, returning to his ancestral home to reclaim his legacy.  But that legacy is in tatters: matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer) lives with her ne'er-do-well brother Roger (Johnny Lee Miller), his 10-year-old spooky son David (Guilliver McGrath), Elizabeth's oversexed teen daughter Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz), and a handful of staff consisting of Caretaker Willie Loomis (Jackie Earle Haley), David's psychiatrist Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter), and David's new governess Victoria Winters (also played by Bella). David, it seems, believes he can talk to ghosts. It's not a happy place.Barnabas' return leads to the discovery to two startling facts: Angelique is an immortal with an iron grip on the town and Victoria is the reincarnation of Josette.  Torn between the two women, Barnabas plans to return his family to its former glory while fending off his own bloody thirst for women and blood.  It's enough to make a vampire blush.The trailers for ""Dark Shadows"" gave the appearance of a comedy, which likely set critics' expectations for an entirely different film.  But this is a Tim Burton/Johnny Depp collaboration that is alternately macabre and humorous - tonally it's no different from any of the other movies they've produced.  The difference is they're playing in someone else's sandbox.  ""Dark Shadows"" has a long legacy compressed in to just a few hours.""Dark Shadows"" is entertaining as the anti-vampire movie - Barnabas frequently walks around with blood trailing down the corners of his mouth - but it has a lot of ground to cover.  Some characters are more fleshed out and relevant than others, leaving Roger a caricature, Carolyn a brooding teen stereotype, and Julia yet another quirky wisp of a personality.  There's enough here that it could easily be fleshed out into a soap opera...which means the film is faithful to its source material.A soap opera about vampires, ghosts, and werewolves?

1470871,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B005LAIHKY,Micheal Hunt,"[9, 15]","Be very aware that there is alot of Vampire fans out there, and a lot of Johnny Depp fans, and seeing Johnny Depp as a vampire is a wet dream for those kind of fans. So expect to see a lot of 5 star reviews that would give the movie top scores on the mere fact that such and such have been put together for the first time. I on the other hand am no fan of Vampire movies, especially ones that sparkle, nor is Johnny Depp a favored actor of mine: so let me be brutally honest when I tell you this movie is really getting overrated reviews from women who just enjoyed seeing one actor of the world play a role that is being done to death lately.The plot is about a wealthy and respected guy (Johnny Depp) who wouldn't fall in love with a witch. So the witch casts a spell on the guys girlfriend to throw herself off of a cliff. The guy plummets after her, only to find the witch has cursed him to be a vampire. The witch then exposes him as a vampire and the town go after him with pitchforks and torches to bury him in the ground forever. 100 or so years later, his coffin is dug up and he returns to his mansion to find his decedents are living there. He introduces himself, but only the mother of the clan, played by Michelle Pheiffer, understands that he is actually the vampire guy who he says he is.The vampire then ends up living with the family and some almost humorous moments take place as the vampire meets and greets new people and talks of vampire things he does, before Michelle Pheiffer steps in and throws them off track by making up an explanation to hide the fact he is a vampire. These scenes could have been much funnier, but look like they where just added in at last minute to try and make some humor for the rest of the mostly dull and boring dialog.The witch who first cursed the guy is still alive too, and she finds out about his return and confronts the guy, and says he must either join her corporation of selling fish, or he will spend another century buried in a tomb. The guy still does not love her, even tho he gives her a vampire vs witch love making scene that failed to be funny, but then says he still doesn't love her, instead he is in love with someone who looked like his former girlfriend. Played by a not-so pretty woman who hardly appears or speaks in the film, it was done horribly wrong to care about.Besides the mother character of Pheiffer, she also has a cheating husband, an annoying 70's style emo daughter, a dork of a kid for a son who rips off the kid from Jurassic park and Jumanji too much, and a nanny who see's dead people. The witch threatens to hurt the kids if the guy doesn't do what she wants, and of coarse, he refuses and the battle is on.By the time the movie ends, it felt rushed, and things seemed thrown in at last second. I wont spoil it for you, but I will say this which will make more sense if you see the part in general... what the hell was with the werewolf thing? It made no sense, was pointless and a stupid idea.The only decent part of this movie was the appearance of Alice Cooper. Playing an intro to Schools Out, into No More Mr Nice Guy and then Balled of Dwight Fry. However, almost ruined when the music is turned down to hear boring ""is it my breath"" dialog of a 100 year old vampire trying to kiss someone who looks 17 years old who see's dead people.Why can't vampire legend be left as it was? Why does this one try to give up drinking blood to fit into the times, look like a bad emo version of Aston Kutcher, and be dead, but have enough blood in his body to keep his heart going to actually get an erection? If the heart doesn't pump blood, no way will that happen... but yet, this guy manages to accept some oral enjoyment from a character in the movie... yeah, just, wouldn't happen if vampires did exist. Sorry ladies, but if Johnny was a vampire, he'd be useless to you in that area, so quit fantasizing about it :PSome parts of the movie where funny, but not all that memorable, so I wouldn't even call this movie ""dark humor""... thats just something people say when Johnny Depp and Tim Burton make films together... but, it's not what I would call dark.

1470890,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B005LAIHKY,M. Oleson,"[2, 7]","Director Tim Burton and actor Johnny Depp team up again for yet another version of their quirkiness.  OK, we get it.  While I never watched the ""Dark Shadows"" soap opera, I understand it was not supposed to be humorous.  So when transplanted to the screen should it have been more serious?  Eh, maybe not.  But at least make up your mind.The movie begins with something similar to Coppala's version of ""Dracula"" (1992) where Barnabas Collins (Depp) is cursed by a witch around 1776 for spurning her love for another.  He becomes a vampire but is soon captured and buried in a silver chained coffin.  Nearly 200 years later the coffin is uncovered at a construction site and Barnabas is set free.  He finds his old homestead is in a poor state and that his fishing enterprise has floundered and replaced by a witchy descendent of Angelique (Eva Green).  Spoiler alert:  The witch is the same person, but has aged well.Barnabas confides in the current head of the household Elizabeth (a still stunning Michelle Pfeiffer) of his secret but doesn't ""come out"" to the others until later.  The house is filled with off kilter children (Chloe Moretz and Gulliver McGrath) and even weirder adult staffers (Jackie Earle Haley, Helena Bonham Carter and Ray Shirley).  Then of course there is the beautiful Bella Heathcote as Victoria, the reincarnation of Barnabas original love from 1776 who was offed by an Angelique spell.The film is full of some excellent photography and well used CGI but it continually bogs down.

I do not know if the critics are narrow minded or they just don't get the magic that Tim Burton and Johnny Depp create together, in every movie they've made, some better than other but all of them just wonderful.In my opinion, as a fan and follower of Burton since I was 13 years old (I'm 35 now), Dark Shadows is the most ""Burtonian"" movie since ""Mars attacks"", full of that scent of satire and black humor that I loved in ""Mars"". But now it's even better because we have the mixture of Burton + Depp. These two guys were meant for each other (with respect to their wives).I went to see it with a friend who is a fan of Johnny, but she doesn't really get the ""Burton"" style. She did not like it. It was a shame I went with her jjaa. That first time I like it and I gave it an 8 in my scale, but the second time I saw it, now in blu-ray, I liked it even more. Last week I saw it again with one of my students and my Mom. Both of them loved it. Case closed: media critics know nothing! It's the most ""Burtonian"" and personal movie since ""Big Fish"". Between then until Dark Shadows, Tim devoted his time to more commercial films, not that I did not enjoy them, but I prefer more of this kind of work.The cast is superb as always. Also, he hires the same actors again. Thanks God, he hired Michelle for this one. After her masterpiece work as Catwoman, I was wondering why Tim waited 20 years to call her back for a role. She's one of the greatest actresses of all time. And for Depp, I wonder what weird role he still has ahead; I think he's done almost everything.

1470896,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B005LAIHKY,Monty Moonlight,"[3, 8]","Barnabas Collins is a vampire from the 18th century whose curse came from a jilted lover who turned out to be a vengeful witch, Angelique Bouchard. Angelique also caused the deaths of Barnabas's parents and his true love, Josette DuPres. And now, when Barnabas is awakened in 1972, he finds Angelique's torture of his family continues. Along with other secret attacks, she has become a wealthy fishing magnate and driven the Collins family out of business. But now that Barnabas is back, he is determined to restore the family honor as the true royalty of Collinsport, Maine. Using his old world charm and vampire gifts, he takes on Angelique in a grudge match to the finish.As a hardcore Dark Shadows fan, I gotta say, that sounds like a pretty decent movie version of the classic show. Plus, you have a great cast bringing to life many of the classic characters from the 60's/70's, supernatural soap opera and its 90's, nighttime soap revival. Johnny Depp is Barnabas, Michelle Pfeiffer is Elizabeth, Chloe Grace Moretz is Carolyn, and Helena Bonham Carter is Dr. Hoffman, to name a few. Tim Burton's gothic style seems a perfect match, and as I said, the plot SOUNDS excellent. I mean, compare it to the first ever Dark Shadows feature with the original cast. This one has a basic story that does a much better job capturing the story of the TV show than the first film, which was just a typical Dracula type movie. In this one, Barnabas is both good and bad, he battles, and the villain is Angelique, as it should be in a Dark Shadows movie about Barnabas. So, why was this not the PERFECT big budget Dark Shadows movie fans have dreamed of?Well, personally, I would have aimed for two trilogies. One telling a three part Barnabas story, and the other telling a three part Quentin werewolf story that includes Barnabas (as a vampire and a good guy). This, to me, is the only way to do the show justice on the big screen. Of course, another important note, I would NOT have made them comedies. Let's face it, that was one of the big issues the fans had with this film. It's not that a Dark Shadows comedy is such a bad thing, it's just that Dark Shadows didn't need to resort to that. This could have been such an epic movie-going experience. It has NOT been done before. Not on the bigscreen with a huge budget, cast, and director. This is such a perfect example of missed opportunity. But, bear with me, I am going to speak well of the film too.But first, let's get more into the negatives. After all, being a comedy doesn't make this a bad film. In truth, it isn't a bad film, it's just not a very good Dark Shadows film. This is not so much because it's a dark comedy, it's because it took far too many liberties to even feel like a true spoof of the original. This film's two biggest problems were an awkward climax and characters that had little in common with the known versions beyond their names and, in some cases, appearances. Yes, Roger and Julia Hoffman were great likenesses of the originals, but they sure weren't playing those characters at all. Why not? I have no idea. Michelle Pfieffer definitely wasn't playing Elizabeth as we have ever known her, nor was Carolyn anything like Carolyn, and I cut Carolyn a lot of slack in this because of her big secret (badly done as it was), which is something I tend to be partial to, and because Chloe Moretz grows more lovely every day. Willie was yet another complete recreation. Fair enough, but I've always said the original Willie was one of the best things that show had going for it, so I don't know why he is turned into more and more of a throwaway, loser character with each version. David was not much like previous Davids either, Mrs. Johnson was a barely moving old woman sight gag, and Barnabas, well, Barnabas... I won't say I didn't like the character Johnny Depp portrayed here, but this wasn't really Barnabas either. Seriously. All I can say is that Angelique was decent (though she got too weird in the climax) and Victoria, well, that character never was much, even though she was important, and she is way more interesting here. At least, her backstory is. It doesn't feel like we really get to spend much getting to know her, though she is definitely a vision to look upon (amazing eyes and love her cutesy outfits). Naturally, having the characters not reflect the originals very much if at all is rather disappointing for fans of the original show. But, besides that, you have moments where you just have to ask, ""Why?"" Was it just to annoy us? I mean, moments like when David refers to Barnabas as ""Uncle Barnabas"" instead of ""Cousin Barnabas"". I mean, we go out of your was to make this is different from the source material as possible? Those are the kinds of choices I never really can get.Besides that, as I said, there is the issue of a very messy climax. This thing was all over the place, throwing too much at you at once and with some very awkward, at times just plain bad lines and acting. One particular reveal about Carolyn comes with some of the worst dialogue (which poor Chloe had to give) that I've ever heard. I could have gotten totally behind this if weren't for that line, a few complaints about the visuals, and the fact that it really felt thrown in. When you know about it already, you can see the little hints in the film, but they are just a smidge too subtle to not make it feel totally thrown in the first time you see the film. Speaking of the first time you see the film, yeah, it's going to look pretty messy. Once you have seen it already, you can take in everything a bit easier. But the first time, Burton is just trying to throw way too much at you way too fast. A most notable one is the relationship between Doc Hoffman and Barnabas. This is only slightly touched upon here, but it is a big deal when it is (and no, it's not like any fan of the shows would imagine it to be). Basically, if you blink, you can miss things here that come back later, and yet, overall, it feels like only a few things were important to the plot at all. It ends up feeling very random and messy, and it's probably much worse if you are not familiar with the original TV show. Not that this film follows that at all, but, well, at least you will ""get"" some aspects of the Doc Hoffman situation, anyway.To move onto the flipside though, this film is not a total loss. The bottom line is, it is a lot of fun to watch. Not everyone will think so, I know, but even as a true fan of the previous two TV shows, I do enjoy this film. It has some very funny moments (though some of the jokes are really lame too, like the McDonald's one that I'm sure the filmmakers thought was comedy gold). It does have some awkward scenes, like the love scene that seems to imply sex, though not really..., and the finale that really is a pretty big problem (am I wrong, or is there a big loose end there involving what everyone in town saw and heard?), but it's also got really neat stuff too, like Alice Cooper giving a performance at Collinwood and some of the original Dark Shadows cast members in attendance. There's a lot to be bugged by in this film, but there's a lot to like and enjoy too. The most difficult part is getting past the opening (just after the prologue), in which Victoria is riding a train to Collinwood and ""Nights in White Satin"" is playing. The problem with that scene is, that looks like a completely different and far better film. Actually, that looks like an incredible, amazing Dark Shadows movie! It really emphasizes the missed opportunity here. But, this one, honestly, is still fun. Some moments feel a bit amateurish to be coming from Burton, but a lot of it is just sooo very entertaining, it is hard not to like, even for a fan of the shows. But, it does leave me with concern that now, one of my other top favorite shows, Kolchak the Night Stalker, is on Depp's to do list (so I can't help but wonder if that means Burton too). Honestly, I always hoped to one day make Dark Shadows and Kolchak movies myself, though, I have so many projects on my mind and so little funds that I hardly expect to get to most of them. I enjoy my down time far too much.Getting to the Blu-Ray (and a key thing to remember is that the ""movie-only"" blu-ray, I hear, does not come with bonus features, so we are forced to pay more for the digital copy and DVD), it naturally looks and sounds gorgeous, so what are the bonus features. Well, I could have hoped for more, but we do get deleted scenes and a nice collection of ""Making Of"" material, though it badly needed a ""Play All"" feature. Also, there is an option to watch the film with even more interviews and behind the scenes footage, including some interviews with original cast members; a pretty nice inclusion. Still, more features could have been had here, from the obvious to the not-so-obvious. The film, when/where I got it came with a slipcover featuring a hologram of Barnabas, though not an interesting, changing one or anything. It's pretty static.And, that's about it. ""Dark Shadows"", not the movie Dark Shadows fans wanted, not a great Dark Shadows movie, and a very flawed movie in general, but also very unique and fun for both fans and newcomers, and great for the Halloween season. It's worth checking out for some laughs or the lovely ladies, or if you're a Burton fanatic, like so many are. I'm happy to have it in my collection, though don't think it reflects the original or 90's versions at all. And, I know the original show is pretty steep on DVD (like, what, 500 or so for the complete series?), but at the very least, you should check out the 90's show, and that one is probably pretty cheap to buy these days. It was REALLY GOOD, and it's what got me into Dark Shadows to begin with. I was pretty obsessed with it, even though they never got around to the werewolves before it was canceled. What a shame the 2000's version never got picked up! Marley Shelton as Victoria? I would have enjoyed that.",4,"Not the Dark Shadows movie we wanted, but definitely a fun, if flawed flick!",1349481600,"10 6, 2012",2012,9975,"['Barnabas', 'Collins', 'vampire', '18th', 'century',

Who wants to see or buy a film that has had every moment ruined and hashed out for them. So having said that let me say, I LOVED THIS FILM. I was very against this film due to the trailer but I am glad I went and saw it in theatres because I was begging for more by the end of the film. This film does indeed have spell to cast, one that is magical, and totally Burton. Yet this Burton film is very much like those of 'ole in that it falls in vein with Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, and Sweeney Todd. From the first chords of the films opening song---NIGHTS IN WHITE SATIN--I was totally hooked. Let me also state that I find it ironic that fans of the orginal show---not all--but some ---hate this film---when in turn the stars of the original show---which some appear in this film---gave the film not only thumbs up but also their blessing. Now isn't that ironic? The film does follow the premise of the original show but with some new liberties and tweaks, and I was amazed to realize that salutes in certain scenes to the films HALLOWEEN, CARRIE, and THE SHINING all which not only influenced a generation but also Burton as a filmmaker. I would definitely suggest this to any film lover, fan of the show, and anyone who is looking for a vampire style film that is not Twilight and is not a gore fest. I truly am suprised that this film did not do better. But I think the studios should never have advertised this as a comedy because it is not. Like other serious films and even horror films, there is some funny moments, which lighten the mood, but it seems once you are smiling and laughing something happens to give you pause and shudder at the dark light of what has just occurred. Give this film a chance. The acting is top notch. The film's capture of the era is pitch perfect. The only sad thing is that Burton has said he will not make a sequel which this film was a set up for grand and great series or even a trilogy of films. But who knows what will happen. I will say, disregard the negative fan base reviews, especially if you are a fan of the genre, Burton, or just love movies. Oh and yes let's not forget the Depp fans, this is one of his best films. So definitely buy it. Love this movie.",5,Brilliant.

If you are waiting for this movie to relate to the old t.v. series, you will be highly disappointed. This movie, unfortunately, follows the same route as the remake of ""The Stepford Wives."" It takes a horror classic and makes it into over the camp comedy movie. Now the original Dark Shadows did have unintentional humor in it but the actors all took their roles seriously. In this movie, this is not the case. The best peroformances do come from Johnny Depp and Michelle Pfeiffer. Eva Green makes a good Angelique. Helena Bonham Carter looks like Grayson Hall but that is it. She acts nothing like Grayson Hall, but in all fairness, who can. The relationship between Barnabas and Dr. Hoffman from the series is nonexisting here. The actress, who plays Carolyn, looks like a child than the spoiled pre-Paris Hilton bitch, that Nancy Barrett played her years ago. Other disappointments, Maggie Evans, Victoria Winters and Josette are all one person. Also, the cameo scene with Jonathan Frid, his last performance before he died, he really did this time,LOL, David Selby, Lara Parker and Kathryn Leigh Scott is so fast that you can miss them with a blink of an eye.

After seeing the movie, it made me start watching the original series. I love how this was mostly a comedy, and a tribute to the series, rather then a serious dramatic soap opera. Johnny Depp was great as Barnabas Collins, the vampire of Collinwood Manor. I love how it had a classic 'fish-out-of-water' story. It was like taking Bela Lugosi's Dracula and putting him in the 70's hippie age. This is definitely a Tim Burton film because everyone wears pale Marilyn Manson-type makeup, and it has Helena Bonham Carter, along with Danny Elfman music. Chloe Moretz gives a great performance as Carolyn Stoddard. She's the rebellious teenager we've seen in all of Burton's other films like Ryder in Beetlejuice.In the 1700's, Barnabas makes the mistake of breaking the heart of a witch named Angelique. She curses him by turning him into a vampire and locks him in a coffin for 200 years. In 1972, the Collins family are trying to find a governess for young David who claims to see the ghost of his mom. Along comes Maggie, who changes her name to Victoria Winters. When Barnabas is found and awakened, he returns home to bring the manor to its former glory and re'vamp' the family business. When Angelique returns and threatens his family, Barnabas must take action and seek revenge on the witch who cursed him.

Turned into a vampire, Barnibus is locked away in a coffin for two centuries. Now, freed by unsuspecting construction workers, Barnibus finds that his home town of Collins Port has drastically changed. He must learn to fit into the 70s while protecting his family, restoring Collins Port to its former glory and riding himself of the evil witch, Angelique, who cursed him to be a creature forced to hide in dark shadows. I absolutely loved this movie. Johnny Depp, who plays Barnibus Collins, did fantastic! Johnny is one of my all time favorite actors and when he teams up with director Tim Burton, you know it's a film worth seeing. The cinematography was great because of the gloominess that you will often find in Tim Burton's films, but they found a flawless way to thrown in the bright colors of the 70's.  The special effects were great too, especially in the end when Angelique's skin started to crack; she really looked as if she was made out of porcelain. Something that did bother me about the visuals was that the blood in the film looked way to fake considering that it is a vampire movie. My favorite character would have to be that daughter of the Collins family played by Chloe Moretz. One; she is my favorite young actress, two; she played a moody, mellow dramatic, angsty teenager perfectly.  The acting in this film was priceless because there was a lot of over-acting, but not in a cheesy way, it was done very purposefully and it gave a wonderful comedic feel to dramatic situations. I suggest this film for ages 13 and up because of sexual situations, mild drug use and language. On a scale of 1-5 I would give this film 6 stars because it far surpassed my expectations!

The actors are just quirky enough to make the charater interesting and make the viewer feel empathetic towards the character.  The script was very funny.

Being both a huge fan both Burton and Depp while being a fan of Dark Shadows, I thought I was getting the best of both worlds.  When I started to see production photos slowly coming out, I thought they got it spot on, until that trailer came out... Disco music, comedy, really?  Still, I went this past Friday into the movie with no expectations..... And lets just say it's not the Dark Shadows your mother grew up with.The movie starts out great with an original story line from the show.  Barnabas Collins and his family create Collinwood and Collinsport.  He then spurns the love a servant girl named Angelique and falls in love with another girl by the name of Jossette.  Angelique, being a witch, curses both of them.  Jossette falls to her death and Barnabas is turned into a Vampire.  He is then locked away in a chained coffin by angry mod, led by Angelique.Fast forward 200 years.  Collinwood and Collinsport still stand.  The Collins family still endure with only a couple members remaining: Elizabeth Stoddard and her daughter Caroline, Elizabeth's brother Roger and his son David.  There's Willy Loomis, their groundskeeper, Mrs. Johnson, a maid (who served no purpose but to stand around and pretend to be an old crazy person), Dr. Julia Hoffman, David's always drunken slosh psychiatrist, and soon they're joined by Victoria Winters (aka Maggie Evans) who comes on as David's governess.  Already, Vicki's character is pushed into the wayside many times in the film, although you would assume she would have a bigger part as being the reincarnation of Jossette.  She only appears when it suits Barnabas' scenes.Depp's Barnabas awakens in 1972 by a construction crew building a Mcdonalds.  Already starts the downfall from here.  Instead of being the serious Barnabas in the opening of the film, Depp plays him as a bumbling fool, all wigged out about all the ""weird"" things he sees along the way (the giant glowing McDonalds M, cars, lava lamps, etc.)  In the television show, Barnabas had put Willy under control and then seemingly planted himself in place with no issues and charm the Collins family in letting him stay at Collinwood.  Never did they know he was a vampire either, as they spill in this movie.Another character dynamic they got all wrong was that of Dr. Hoffman.  In the television show, she was a doctor that dealt blood diseases, thus trying to always cure Barnabas of his curse.  She was always the voice of concern and did develop a friendship with Barnabas. Helena Carter's portrayal is far from the loving doctor we know, where she is constantly drunk, uses sexual favors to get what she wants and instead of finding a cure for Barnabas, she has other plans on how to use his blood.You find out later on that the Collins are almost broke due to another company called Angel Bay.  You can see where this is going.  Angel could be short for Angelique maybe?  Eva Green did Lara Parker a grave injustice by portraying Angelique as some sad, desperate slut who happens to be a witch.  Hilarity ensues, there's conflict, and a big climatic ending.My biggest beef with this film is while it made many references to the television show, Burton and Depp had made this more of a campy comedy rather than a serious soap opera.  Granted the television show was know for it's very campy drama and occasional bloopers in scenes.  But it still managed to be serious when it needed to be.  I think the biggest mistake was to let Seth Grahame-Smith (Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter) write the screenplay.  He's know for writing humorous spoofs and that's what he did with this. Sure it had it's moments, but to do that through out was a mistake.  Another thing that was wrong was all the ""surprises"" they made.  Caroline turns into a werewolf and breaks the third wall, telling the audience to ""deal with it.""  Okay sorry, I wanted to cry foul and not deal it.  It was lame.The only thing rewarding about this film was the performances of Jackie Earl Haley (Willie) and Michelle Pfeiffer (Elizabeth).  Even Belle Heathcote (Victoria) had a great performance, it's ashame they didn't give her more.Out of all the Burton/Depp movies, this one was my least favorite.  That's very hard to say, considering I love all of the films they've made over the years.  It had so much potential, but they ruined it.  I prefer my cheezy soap opera.  It's like they made 2 different movies, one serious and one humorous.  They should've worked more on it, made it serious and released it on Halloween.  Would've been more fitting that way.",2,Not your Mother's Dark Shadows.,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,4707,"['*possible', 'spoilers*When', 'first', 'heard', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'were', 'collaborating', 'making', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'movie', 'squealed', 'biggest', 'fan', 'girl', 'ever', 'Being', 'huge', 'fan', 'Burton', 'Depp', 'being', 'fan', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'thought', 'was', 'getting', 'best', 'worlds', 'When', 'started', 'see', 'production', 'photos', 'slowly', 'coming', 'out', 'thought', 'got', 'spot', 'trailer', 'came', 'out', 'Disco', 'music', 'comedy', 'really', 'Still', 'went', 'past', 'Friday', 'movie', 'expectations', '..', 'just', 'say', 'not', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'mother', 'grew', 'up', 'with.The', 'movie', 'out', 'great', 'original', 'story', 'line', 'show', 'Barnabas', 'Collins', 'family', 'create', 'Collinwood', 'Collinsport', 'then', 'love', 'servant', 'girl', 'named', 'Angelique', 'love', 'girl', 'name', 'Jossette', 'Angelique', 'being', 'witch', 'Jossette', 'death', 'Barnabas', 'turned', 'Vampire', 'then', 'locked', 'away', 'chained', 'coffin', 'angry', 'mod', 'led', 'Angelique.Fast', 'forward', '200', 'years', 'Collinwood', 'Collinsport', 'still', 'stand', 'Collins', 'family', 'still', 'endure', 'only', 'couple', 'members', 'remaining', 'Elizabeth', 'Stoddard', 'daughter', 'Caroline', 'Elizabeth', 'brother', 'Roger', 'son', 'David', 'Willy', 'Loomis', 'groundskeeper', 'Mrs.', 'Johnson', 'maid', 'who', 'served', 'purpose', 'stand', 'around', 'pretend', 'be', 'old', 'crazy', 'person', 'Dr.', 'Julia', 'Hoffman', 'David', 'always', 'drunken', 'slosh', 'psychiatrist', 'soon', ""'re"", 'joined', 'Victoria', 'Winters', 'aka', 'Maggie', 'Evans', 'who', 'David', 'governess', 'Already', 'Vicki', 'character', 'pushed', 'wayside', 'many', 'times', 'film', 'would', 'assume', 'would', 'have', 'bigger', 'part', 'being', 'reincarnation', 'Jossette', 'only', 'when', 'suits', 'Barnabas', 'scenes.Depp', 'Barnabas', '1972', 'construction', 'crew', 'building', 'Mcdonalds', 'downfall', 'here', 'Instead', 'being', 'serious', 'Barnabas', 'opening', 'film', 'Depp', 'bumbling', 'fool', 'wigged', 'out', 'weird', 'things', 'way', 'giant', 'glowing', 'McDonalds', 'M', 'cars', 'lava', 'lamps', 'etc', 'television', 'show', 'Barnabas', 'had', 'put', 'Willy', 'control', 'then', 'seemingly', 'planted', 'place', 'issues', 'charm', 'Collins', 'family', 'letting', 'stay', 'Collinwood', 'Never', 'did', 'know', 'was', 'vampire', 'either', 'spill', 'movie.Another', 'character', 'dynamic', 'got', 'wrong', 'was', 'Dr.', 'Hoffman', 'television', 'show', 'was', 'doctor', 'dealt', 'blood', 'diseases', 'thus', 'trying', 'always', 'cure', 'Barnabas', 'curse', 'was', 'always', 'voice', 'concern', 'did', 'develop', 'friendship', 'Barnabas', 'Helena', 'Carter', 'portrayal', 'far', 'loving', 'doctor', 'know', 'where', 'constantly', 'drunk', 'sexual', 'favors', 'get', 'what', 'instead', 'finding', 'cure', 'Barnabas', 'other', 'plans', 'how', 'use', 'blood.You', 'find', 'out', 'later', 'Collins', 'are', 'almost', 'broke', 'due', 'company', 'called', 'Angel', 'Bay', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'going', 'Angel', 'could', 'be', 'short', 'Angelique', 'maybe', 'Eva', 'Green', 'did', 'Lara', 'Parker', 'grave', 'injustice', 'portraying', 'Angelique', 'sad', 'desperate', 'slut', 'who', 'be', 'witch', 'Hilarity', 'conflict', 'big', 'climatic', 'ending.My', 'biggest', 'beef', 'film', 'made', 'many', 'references', 'television', 'show', 'Burton', 'Depp', 'had', 'made', 'more', 'campy', 'comedy', 'rather', 'serious', 'soap', 'opera', 'Granted', 'television', 'show', 'was', 'know', 'very', 'campy', 'drama', 'occasional', 'bloopers', 'scenes', 'still', 'managed', 'be', 'serious', 'when', 'needed', 'be', 'think', 'biggest', 'mistake', 'was', 'let', 'Seth', 'Grahame-Smith', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', 'write', 'screenplay', 'know', 'writing', 'humorous', 'spoofs', 'what', 'did', 'Sure', 'had', 'moments', 'do', 'out', 'was', 'mistake', 'thing', 'was', 'wrong', 'was', 'surprises', 'made', 'Caroline', 'werewolf', 'third', 'wall', 'telling', 'audience', 'deal', 'Okay', 'sorry', 'wanted', 'cry', 'foul', 'not', 'deal', 'was', 'lame.The', 'only', 'thing', 'rewarding', 'film', 'was', 'performances', 'Jackie', 'Earl', 'Haley', 'Willie', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'Elizabeth', 'Even', 'Belle', 'Heathcote', 'Victoria', 'had', 'great', 'performance', 'ashame', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'more.Out', 'Burton/Depp', 'movies', 'one', 'was', 'least', 'favorite', 'very', 'hard', 'say', 'considering', 'love', 'films', ""'ve"", 'made', 'years', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'ruined', 'prefer', 'cheezy', 'soap', 'opera', 'made', '2', 'different', 'movies', 'one', 'serious', 'one', 'humorous', 'should', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'more', 'made', 'serious', 'released', 'Halloween', 'Would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'fitting', 'way']",N/A

1470980,A6D5ZA35QYLDA,B005LAIHKY,R. Wall,"[163, 205]","I really look forward to the Blu-Ray Release of Burton's Dark Shadows as it sounds like there are nine additional segments to the movie that can be watched individually or as part of an expanded feature film...if I understand correctly. For sure there is a fairly fast, fun paced DARK yet FUNNY movie.To begin with...if you are a traditional vampire purist...you WILL be aggravated that Barnabas never encounters a Crucifix, never disappears on demand or turns into a bat nor is required to sleep in his coffin by day.The Burton ""take"" on the Collins family (and employees) yields Elizabeth Collins Stoddard, her brother Roger Collins, her daughter Carolyn, his son David, Dr Julia Hoffman, Willie Loomis, Sarah Johnson and of course Barnabas Collins. ""Victoria Winters"" and Angelique Bouchard round out the main cast.The flick is a nice tight jaunt of around 113 minutes and is very well paced. Most of the material seen on the movie trailers are quickly whisked by in the film's first ten to fifteen minutes. The story of the Barnabas' original time period from 1752 thru 1776 is recounted swiftly including his being cursed (for rejecting Angelique) and buried alive by the town's people (for being a monster). Barnabas' parents Joshua and Naomi are shown so briefly that all we remember is Joshua's declaration that ""family is only the REAL wealth"" while he builds a formidable fortune (using the wealth he built up in Liverpool) by building the seaport town of Collinsport and transforming it into a great fishery/sea port.Light humor abounds throughout the flick...most of it pertaining to Barnabas trying to `ingest"" and ""adjust to"" this great new age of 1972 after being released from his chained coffin after a construction crew literally bangs into his coffin. Barnabas is released. The construction crew do not live to tell about their discovery as Barnabas' nutrient deprived body demands a quick and furious feast.After an encounter with ""Mephistopheles"", ""Lucifer"" and the towns people...Barnabas finally makes his way to Collinwood. He is shocked to discover the dilapidated condition that Collinwood is in and immediately seeks out the matriarch for some answers. He makes it clear to the matriarch that he's the original Barnabas Collins cursed for two centuries. She thinks he's an intruder looking for money and blood until he shows her the Family Wealth safely hidden in the lowest secret passages of the mansion. She, then, realizes that Barnabas is the genuine item and she introduces him to the family the next morning at breakfast but keeps his secret intact.Angelique, meanwhile, has spent two centuries being a rival to the Collins family industry and has driven them to almost poverty levels. Angelique subsequently learns of Barnabas being released from his ""life imprisonment"" and throws all her witchery to wage war against Barnabas and the Collins family..During the remaining hour and change of the film...we are treated to the fact that the Collins family members as well as the new governess, ""Victoria Winters"" each have secrets that are brought to light during the course of the film.Dr Hoffman discovers that Barnabas is a vampire and promises to cure him as Barnabas is soon walking out in the light of day albeit that he appears somewhat like Michael Jackson with an umbrella.In the midst of this drama...Barnabas wants to gain the favor of the townsfolk by throwing a ""happening"".  According to Carolyn...the ""happening"" needs lots of booze and a superstar singer to ""rock"" the town as she suggests Alice Cooper.  Barnabas promises enough booze to fill a schooner and declares ""she"", Alice Cooper, will be the guest of the Collins Family.  The Collinsport ""happening"" is a success.It's at this point that I would like to comment on the film's soundtrack.  Burton very effectively uses Percy Faith's a theme from ""A Summer Place""...The Moody Blues ""Nights in White Satin""....The Carpenter's ""Top Of The World"" and Alice Cooper's ""No More Mr Nice Guy"" and ""Ballad of Dwight Frye"".  Other nice selections are included.  Loved the music.As the film drives toward it's climax...Barnabas and the Collins family steadily move toward their final battle with Angelique which contains a surprise or two.I found the ending (unlike most movie reviewers) quite satisfying after Burton throws everything but the kitchen sink into the final conflict. Unlike many reviewers I did not see a strong indication for a sequel. I don't expect one.The cast performed superbly.  Special Kudos to Johnny Depp and Eva Green as Barnabas and Angelique...but they were all superb in my opinion.After all is said and done...I loved Tim Burton's ""Dark Shadows"" for being uniquely it's own film not borrowing from the two Dan Curtis films of the 1970s. The visuals do overshadow the script....but we are having so much fun watching all the dysfunctional members of the family fighting for the Collins' true core value that ""family is the only REAL wealth""...that we don't see any reason to criticize the script's shortcomings because it's so darn much fun.",4,"Anybody for Shadows that are Funny, Quirky yet DARK???

Burton is a very on and off director for me.  He sometimes makes great films like Beetlejuice and then makes awful ones like Planet of the Apes.This time he&#8217;s off.Parts of the film are similar to the TV series by Dan Curtis.  Victoria Winters (not her real name) goes to Collinwood for a job as a governess for David, a kid who is odd and has a doctor who counsels him.Victoria sees things.  She has a dark past with her parents callously sending her off to an asylum because she &#8216;sees things.&#8217;  As Barnabas later points out, they should be sent to hell.  Nice line!The story is really between two protagonists:  Angelique (who has been putting the Collins&#8217; out of the fishing business for 100 years) and Barnabas (recently risen from the grave where Angelique put him, killing for blood).The film does not know whether it&#8217;s a comedy or a horror movie.  The original soap opera was campy in many ways and I did not expect that.  But Barnabas being a dope with Victoria (who looks just like his lost love Josette, who would&#8217;a thought!) and at the same time slaughtering a bunch of hippies at a campfire.Bottom line:  If you&#8217;re looking for nostalgia, forget it.

Lee,"[0, 1]","I have heard that this movie was based on a popular soap-opera TV show in the years before I was born, but this movie is actually pretty good for its contemporaries. While it may not endure as a classic, the beautiful images, scenery, witty writing style, costumes, and music--have made this movie a little unique on its own. The movie's story is definitely centered on Barnabas, with the rest of the (Collins) family members as his supporting cast. I was actually thinking of a comedy with Gothic scenery before watching this movie; so, I was a bit more amused when it was slowly turning into a gangster-style movie. There were lots of poetic moments (e.g.) a strong, ambitious and determined woman as its villain) and satirical dialogue writing, but it was sort of a letdown when some of &#34;twists&#34; towards the end were revealed in order to &#34;finish&#34; the movie. I thought that the storytellers had probably tried to cram as many characteristics from the source material as much as they could, but it didn't effectively work out because the movie has been about Barnabas and his arch-enemy Angelique since its beginning. I had mixed feelings at the end because I felt really sorry for its villain and the family whom she had tried to destroy for two centuries. Sadly, the planned mixture of comedy and serious elements of power-play (and especially that out-of-this-world character revelation towards the end) just didn't blend well for its &#34;blood is thicker than water&#34; message (sorry for the intended pun).On the other hand, I feel so blessed with this holiday with another of Amazon.com's exceptional service. Not only I have received a free (limited) access of the streaming movie version, but I also received the package a lot sooner than expected.

I am a fan of Tim Burton, however, even as I'm aware of his hits and misses, which made me curious to see his version of Dark Shadows. I've seen it on the big screen and now a handful of times on HBO, a testament to the fact that I find it worth repeated viewings.This movie bears little resemblance to the program - the words of the many dissenting opinions - putting it squarely in line with the majority of movie versions of old tv programs. It's a safe plan that shuns creativity for easy manipulation of a particular fan base.  Tim Burton and Johnny Depp are reportedly a part of that reverent fan base, but that doesn't stop Burton from employing his deft macabre touch and penchant for overblown conclusions to tell a satirical tale of an cursed man (Barnabas Collins) who comes back to 1972 New England to restore the family name and settle an old score with the witch who cursed him (played deliciously by the lovely Eva Green).The jokes are mostly of the fish out of water variety, Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, and the aforementioned Green clearly relish their campy roles, the movie has silly sub-plots and could be trimmed by a good fifteen minutes, and the ending is a typically epic Burton confrontation, yet in spite of all that, this movie was very enjoyable for me. There are some truly funny moments and Depp's campilicious performance keeps the silliness rolling along. I've been critical of Depp turning into a cartoon with his roles, but for some reason, his turn here works for me. No accounting for taste, aye?Dark Shadows is played for laughs and irony, and it worked for me.  It reminds me of The Brady Bunch movies, and those too are funny yet irreverent to the source material. If you approach this movie without expectations and prejudice, you might enjoy the ride as much as I do. If you go into it expecting a loving recreation of a beloved tv show, you'll most likely be very disappointed.3.5 - 4 stars",4,It's Tim Burton...what do you expect?,1374278400,"07 20, 2013",2013,2104,"['have', 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'airing', 'did', 'ages', '3-8', 'thus', 'having', 'interest', 'afternoon', 'tv', 'kind', 'age', 'am', 'fan', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'however', 'even', ""'m"", 'aware', 'hits', 'misses', 'made', 'curious', 'see', 'version', 'Dark', 'Shadows', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'big', 'screen', 'now', 'handful', 'times', 'HBO', 'testament', 'fact', 'find', 'worth', 'repeated', 'viewings.This', 'movie', 'little', 'resemblance', 'program', 'words', 'many', 'dissenting', 'opinions', 'putting', 'squarely', 'line', 'majority', 'movie', 'versions', 'old', 'tv', 'programs', 'safe', 'plan', 'creativity', 'easy', 'manipulation', 'particular', 'fan', 'base', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'are', 'reportedly', 'part', 'reverent', 'fan', 'base', ""n't"", 'stop', 'Burton', 'employing', 'deft', 'macabre', 'touch', 'penchant', 'overblown', 'conclusions', 'tell', 'satirical', 'tale', 'cursed', 'man', 'Barnabas', 'Collins', 'who', 'back', '1972', 'New', 'England', 'restore', 'family', 'name', 'settle', 'old', 'score', 'witch', 'who', 'cursed', 'played', 'deliciously', 'lovely', 'Eva', 'Green', '.The', 'jokes', 'are', 'mostly', 'fish', 'water', 'variety', 'Depp', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'aforementioned', 'Green', 'clearly', 'relish', 'campy', 'roles', 'movie', 'silly', 'sub-plots', 'could', 'be', 'trimmed', 'good', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'ending', 'typically', 'epic', 'Burton', 'confrontation', 'yet', 'spite', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'are', 'truly', 'funny', 'moments', 'Depp', 'campilicious', 'performance', 'silliness', 'rolling', 'along', ""'ve"", 'been', 'critical', 'Depp', 'turning', 'cartoon', 'roles', 'reason', 'turn', 'here', 'accounting', 'taste', 'aye', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'played', 'laughs', 'irony', 'worked', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'movies', 'too', 'are', 'funny', 'yet', 'irreverent', 'source', 'material', 'approach', 'movie', 'expectations', 'prejudice', 'might', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'go', 'expecting', 'loving', 'recreation', 'beloved', 'tv', 'show', ""'ll"", 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'very', 'disappointed.3.5', '4', 'stars']",N/A

If however, you would like to see a really great theatrical adaptation of the classic TV series Dark Shadows - well, better luck next time. Alas, this is not so much ""Dark Shadows"", as it is ""The Tim Burton movie"" - pretty much the same one he's been making over and over for more than a decade now. Tim was great back when he was doing projects that were not remakes, but as soon as he started ""Re-imagining"" classics, he fell into a rut, and hasn't been able to climb out, and Johnny Depp is stuck down there with him. The film starts out promisingly enough, with a similar origin story to the series, but when Barnabas wakes up in 1972, and meets his Addams Family wanna-be relatives, it all starts to come unglued. A bunch of not so funny 1970s pop culture gags follow, then we get to see Barney battle the evil Witch who vamped him out in the first place. This ain't no Hammer film, so instead of the edge of your seat Undead Nosferatu taking on a Satanic Sorceress monster clash, we get a quip spouting pale skinned goofball, competing with a Yuppie Itch-Bay in a bad wig, to see who's company can sell more Fish sticks. Yea, there is Gothic window dressing, and some Monster and Ghost lip service, but this is not your Parent's Dark Shadows - their's was way better! There are some good things that this movie has helped to bring about. Apparently, because it flopped(deservedly so), some other classics may be spared the same fate. Depp's next Victims were to be The Thin Man, and Kolchak the Night Stalker, and the former has already been shelved, hopefully, the latter will follow. Also, the REAL Dark Shadows movies(House of, and Night of)are finally being released on Blu-Ray/DVD to coincide with Burton's folly.

There's a hilarious scene of supernatural wall climbing, ornament-smashing ultra-sex (think Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone in The Professional, but with super powers).

A vampire that looks like a vampire.2. 200 years out-of-time person acts like one (Depp flawlessly uttering a script straight from a Victorian Thesaurus) .3. A real world plotline of sorts.4. This version of Barnabas cares for his family; the previous version slaughters them like cattle.5. A sense of humor...finally.I really didn't want a remake of House of Dark Shadows, a blood-fest of killing everybody that depressed me when it came out. By contrast, the construction worker massacre was bloody, yet brilliantly executed with almost comical visuals. The weed smoking scene was also oddly appropriate for the time, while having a wretched, screaming, but-no-blood-shown climax.Helena Bonham Carter's Julia Hoffman was brutally funny (hypnotizing a vampire is pretty odd twist).Of course Tim Burton and Johnny Depp would humor it up a little! The source material was humorless and needed a fresh perspective, though I could've done without many of the juvenile puns. A serious re-boot was already attempted and it didn't last past one season. The original formula should best remain part of TV history.The music track was very reminiscent of Robert Colbert's scores, without the overbearing soap opera melodramatic sound.So lighten up...I think they did a pretty good job of avoiding recycling a boring gothic vampire story that has been made over and over.

I believe that most purists of the daytime serial (including myself) were hoping for a script that was melodramatic in tone and stuck to what made the show a success in the first place: a piece of work that may have been hard to believe but took itself so seriously that one became lost in the characters and stories. Instead, Tim Burton's take on ""Dark Shadows"" is a comedic one with the bulk of the script dealing with Barnabas Collins being released from his coffin in 1972 and trying to adjust to a new time with strange people and events.All of the original characters from the ABC series are present and Johnny Depp (an ardent fan of Barnabas and of the show) does his best with the material he is given, but as I was watching the film I couldn't help think that there will only be one true Barnabas and that is Jonathan Frid who sadly passed away a few weeks before the film's debut in theaters. Jonathan actually has a cameo in the movie (his last acting role as a guest at a party) along with others from the serial including the beautiful Lara Parker (Angelique), David Selby (Quentin Collins) and Katherine Leigh Scott (Maggie Evans/Josette DuPres).The Blue Ray will feature 9 scenes cut from the theatrical release so that is something to look forward.""Dark Shadows"" was a hit upon its release in May, 2012 making $236,000,000 on a $150,000,000 budget so Warners was quite happy and it did bring renewed interest in the original series with MPI releasing a beautiful box set of all 1225 episodes along with a slew of bonus features in a coffin that quickly sold out.On October 30th, 2012 the two original ""Dark Shadows"" films from 1970 and 1971 will be released separately on DVD and Blu Ray for the first time so look for those titles too.",5,"""Hello Barnabas!!!!""",1344038400,"08 4, 2012",2012,1911,"['many', 'ardent', 'fans', '1960', 'soap', 'opera', 'did', 'not', '2012', 'film', 'version', 'series', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'starring', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'really', 'fun', 'film', 'believe', 'most', 'purists', 'daytime', 'serial', 'including', 'were', 'hoping', 'script', 'was', 'melodramatic', 'tone', 'stuck', 'what', 'made', 'show', 'success', 'first', 'place', 'piece', 'work', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'hard', 'believe', 'took', 'so', 'seriously', 'one', 'became', 'lost', 'characters', 'stories', 'Instead', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'take', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'comedic', 'one', 'bulk', 'script', 'dealing', 'Barnabas', 'Collins', 'being', 'released', 'coffin', '1972', 'trying', 'adjust', 'new', 'time', 'strange', 'people', 'events.All', 'original', 'characters', 'ABC', 'series', 'are', 'present', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'ardent', 'fan', 'Barnabas', 'show', 'best', 'material', 'given', 'was', 'watching', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'one', 'true', 'Barnabas', 'Jonathan', 'Frid', 'who', 'sadly', 'passed', 'away', 'few', 'weeks', 'film', 'debut', 'theaters', 'Jonathan', 'actually', 'cameo', 'movie', 'last', 'acting', 'role', 'guest', 'party', 'others', 'serial', 'including', 'beautiful', 'Lara', 'Parker', 'Angelique', 'David', 'Selby', 'Quentin', 'Collins', 'Katherine', 'Leigh', 'Scott', 'Maggie', 'Evans/Josette', 'DuPres', '.The', 'Blue', 'Ray', 'will', 'feature', '9', 'scenes', 'cut', 'theatrical', 'release', 'something', 'look', 'forward', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'was', 'hit', 'release', 'May', '2012', 'making', '236,000,000', '150,000,000', 'budget', 'Warners', 'was', 'quite', 'happy', 'did', 'bring', 'renewed', 'interest', 'original', 'series', 'MPI', 'releasing', 'beautiful', 'box', 'set', '1225', 'episodes', 'slew', 'bonus', 'features', 'coffin', 'quickly', 'sold', 'out.On', 'October', '30th', '2012', 'two', 'original', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'films', '1970', '1971', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'separately', 'DVD', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'first', 'time', 'so', 'look', 'titles', 'too']",N/A

1471063,A2D63RN5LF14R2,B005LAIHKY,"THE BLUEMAHLER ""THE BLUEMAHLER""","[23, 36]","Tim Burton will go down as an artist who peaked early. Dark Shadows (2012) continues the autopilot fatigue that has plagued this director for the past sixteen years. Burton's quasi-religious fan base has a tendency to erroneously dress him up as a ""dark"" auteur. Rather, his is a one-note style with increasingly few exceptions. The bulk of his post Ed Wood (1994) films are ""Disneyfied"" and actually jettison the darker, complex nuances in favor of what he imagines to be audience accessibility. Alice in Wonderland (2010) and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) are lucid examples of this syndrome. Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka projected far more interior disturbance than Johnny Depp`s silicone interpretation. In Burton's Alice, Lewis Carroll's twitchy surrealism gave way to a Disney-paced narrative with yet another cartoon pseudo performance by Depp at its center.Many critics harp on Burton's narrative shortcomings. The films of Luis Bu&ntilde;uel refute the lie that three-dimensional characterizations are absolutely wedded to orthodox narratives. Burton's early films evoked a strikingly fresh milieu with characters who, on the surface, seemed to be flying the freak flag high. But, Burton's initial cannon of freaks really weren't so different than the rest of us. If Pee Wee Herman, Adam, Barbara, Lydia and Beetlejuice, Bruce Wayne & Selina Kyle, Edward Scissorhands, Kim, and Peg, along with Ed Wood and Bela Lugosi were not immediate family, then perhaps they were extended family or close friends with whom we felt affinity, kinship, and admiration.Then, something happened. Burton lost his mojo, and Depp followed suit in an even more pronounced, blatantly obvious way. At one point, Depp promised to be the new Brando, offering a fresh alternative to the plasticity of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. Whoever would have guessed that Cruise would eventually prove to be a smarter, riskier, more clever actor? Nothing in Depp's later career has the nuanced depth of Brando's Don, Paul, or Jack Mickler. Cruise's Bill Harford, Frank Mackey, John Anderton, and Colonel Claus resonate far more intelligence and commitment to craft than anything Depp has committed to celluloid in the last decade. Instead, in his non-Burton films, Johnny Depp has become a parody of Errol Flynn's late career parody. Doused in increasingly thick make-up and mascara, Depp's offerings have amounted to flaccid drag (perhaps Ed Wood's hooks dug too deeply into Depp). If Depp's lethargic, dumbed-down Flynn-esque caricaturization increasingly amount to a dull train wreck then, in Dark Shadows, we witness the actor's de-evolving slide into Bela Lugosi drag, which sounds more interesting than it actually is.Depp's phlegmatic Barnabas Collins all but evaporates inside a movie that sees Burton imitating Burton, disguised as a Gothic soaper that only worked as a product of its time and place. It would seem obvious, to anyone with an iota of artistic or pop culture instinct, or even to anyone who remembers the original ""Dark Shadows,"" that the series simply cannot not be duplicated. The short-lived, early 90s remake only served to reiterate how delightfully dated the original series had become.Burton's big screen treatment, some fifty years after the fact, is even further removed. Burton attempts to stylize Dark Shadows with his sophisticated, big budget stamp, never once realizing that the rudimentary quality of the original is its sole staying power. But even in his lampoon take, Burton plays it safe, and the film never rises above a ho-hum investment.A vapid lead character, made strictly of cardboard with a cut-and-paste performance, is the sleepwalking ringmaster in a cookie-cutter ensemble. Even Eva Green, who proved herself a remarkably complex actress in Casino Royale (2006), fails to register. She is given no direction in a flatly written character. Chloe Grace Moretz, another promising talent (who did very good work in last year's Hugo), is simply placed in front of a lens and told to snarl. Helena Bonham Carter screeches annoyingly as Dr. Julia Hoffman; she seems like a character lifted out of a second-tier Hanna-Barbara cartoon. Only Michelle Pfeiffer, who can be a stoic actress, briefly manages to generate any living flesh from the printed script.On the surface, Burton and Depp should have been as interesting a collaboration as Tod Browning and Lon Chaney, but the former team was composed of genuine malcontents coming from an actual freak circuit. Burton and Depp were birthed by Disney and ""21 Jump Street."" It shows. Dark Shadows is yet another failure in the Burton/Depp cannon. Burton and Depp's Dark Shadows comes across like a lecture from two stuffy, aging academics, who might have been genuinely weird at one time, failing to convince us how hilarious the original series now seems. Yuk yuk. In the last 16 years, the most interesting film Burton has himself directed was 2005's The Corpse Bride. Burton seems to relate better to actual cartoons. Perhaps the upcoming Frankenweenie will redeem him. But, haven't we seen that one already? Hopefully, it will not be further proof of Burton coasting by on his past successes.Regardless, in the meantime, I wish somebody would separate those boys, Tim and Johnny.*my review originally

1471073,A37J6JRKISQMH0,B005LAIHKY,"Thomas Mc ""THOM""","[3, 8]","When I saw that Tim Burton and Johnny Depp were making a big screen adaptation of ""Dark Shadows"" I was thrilled. But a little apprehensive, how could a clunky, corn ball old television show be revived and made relevant for today? The attempt at resurrecting it in the early 1990's as a television series with Ben Cross in the lead was a dismal failure and a horror, but not in a good way. But I felt that if anyone could pull it off Tim Burton and Johnny Depp could. What I didn't realize was how well they would do it. The new ""Dark Shadows"" is surprisingly very, very good! Depp of course is absolutely perfect as the fish-out-of-water Barnabas, released from his coffin in 1972 after being trapped in it and buried away for over a century. The culture clash is hilarious. Depp's Barnabas is a hoot, but also very endearing and lovable. The film is much darker than the trailer suggests, much closer in feel to Burton's wonderful ""Sleepy Hollow."" Though some of the silly fans of the old series were hilariously outraged that the film was a ,gasp, ""comedy,"" they can be totally ignored and their opinions regarded as irrelevant, because nothing anyone could do with ""their"" show would make them happy. They should just watch the old show's dvds and stay in their fantasy world. Now don't get me wrong, the old show is fun and has a certain charm, and Jonathan Frid and Grayson Hall are great. But the show was always campy and impossible to take seriously. Anyway it was great for its time, but that was then, this is now. Burton took the right approach in revving up the fun. The new DS is what the old show would have been if they had had a big budget and writers with a better sense of humor. Frid and the other cast members of the old show were cool enough to ""get it"", they loved the new movie. It was sad that Jonathan Frid died just before it's release. The movie succeeds, however, largely due to the fact that Burton and Depp genuinely love the old series and paid loving homage to it. The cast is perfect, especially Michelle Pheiffer as Elizabeth the matron of the 1972 Collins family and Eva Green as the witch Angelique. Helena Bonham Carter as Dr. Hoffman is great and steals every scene she's in, as does Jackie Earl Haley as Willie Loomis. Chlo Grace Moretz and Gulliver McGrath are delightful as the Collins kids. The entire cast is great including Alice Cooper and Christopher Lee in wonderful cameos. The production values are first rate, the movie is beautiful and visually stunning, and the music! The music is incredible, maybe one of the best scores ever! The Danny Elman score is unexpectedly brilliant! And the incorporation of some great old 70's songs like ""Knights in White Satin"" and ""Go All the Way"" is also brilliantly achieved. The Carpenters ""Top of the World"" has never sounded so cool! Barry White's ""My First, My Last, My Everything,"" is the perfect accompaniment to a hilarious love-making scene between Barnabas and Angelique. It's great seeing all the 1972 nostalgic references, like ""Scooby Doo"" on television and ""Deliverance"" and ""Dracula AD 1972"" on theater marquees. The lava lamp is great fun! The movie is fun, brilliant and a breath of fresh air, everything it should be and I can't wait to own in on dvd! I hope the film does well enough box-office wise to warrant a sequel. It has made so far nearly 80,000,000 at the US box-office, which is amazingly good for a film so off-beat, with such a quirky sense of humor and based on an old 1960's/'70's forgotten television show! Plus it has become fashionable for movie critics to unfairly trash anything Tim Burton does. The movie will grow in popularity when it becomes a cult film on the college circuit and is released on dvd and to cable television, it will find its audience in the US. And the film has done very well internationally, world-wide it's box-office gross is close to $250,000,000 so far. That's good news for Barnabas and company and the movie is good news for audiences who enjoy a slick blend of humor and horror.

I am a DS purist, in fact, I own the entire series, all 26 volumes.  I loved it as a boy, running home to see it twice, once at 3:30 and another at 4:00.  The show was escapism at its best, especially for a primary school kid.I loved all of the original actors in their varied roles.  No one, not even Depp, whom I consider the best actor on the planet since Pirates 1.  He did a good job in what was asked of him, but he's no Jonathan Frid.  And Angelique?  I don't even know the blonde's name who played her here but there is no woman on this Earth better that bringing Angelique to life than Lara Parker.  The question asked on the boys of my generation is this:  Ginger or Mary Ann?  I say that question is incomplete.  Throw Angelique in that mix and, to me, the answer would be a hands-down Angelique.  Lara Parker is one of the most beautiful daytime actresses I have ever seen, enough so to jolt the heart of a seven year old boy!!I guess I am the purest among purists but I was disappointed that this movie didn't stay true to the original ""intent"" of the series.  The first movie, The House of Dark Shadows, was really just a jazzed up version of events we had already seen in the series, we'd seen it all before, but it took some of the blood and gore to higher levels. It was exciting and fun!  Even a 2012 remake of that, with a few tweeks, would have been ok.I guess I am nostalgic for the old days, but this movie did not do it for me.  With a $100 million plus budget and todays special effects, the write story line could have been the scariest thrill ride in the last decade.  The result, old purists like me would have been talking about it non-stop and legions of new fans would have come on board.Talk about the making of a new film franchise? This could have been the next monster, pardon my pun.And my mood for this review isn't helped by the fact that Jonathan Frid died earlier this year.

1471077,AAGLJJ0OUBO8V,B005LAIHKY,Tim,"[129, 144]","I had two big surprises when I started watching Dark Shadows. First: the trailer was very misleading. The trailers made this film look as if it was going to be a complete comedy. Much to my delight, the film was actually a lot darker than I thought it would be. While I have no problem with comedies, I felt that making this a completely comedic film would not do justice to the original Dark Shadows TV show, in which the comedic elements were not its main draw.The second surprise for me was that this felt like an older Tim Burton film. Now when I say that, I mean it feels like a return to his more macabre films than his recent output. Burton has always been at his best in my mind when dealing with horror elements, such as Sleepy Hollow or even Ed Wood. He draws on classic horror films and plays with their tropes. He hasn't been doing this as much recently with the exception of Sweeney Todd. Other than that he's been doing more family friendly films (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Alice in Wonderland come to mind) which don't capture the feel of his older films. There's nothing wrong with trying something new, but this is a return to classic Burton.The film works fairly well. The funny bits are funny and the scary bits are... well, I guess they could unnerve some people. Burton's usual color scheme is in effect, so expect a lot of dark colors with red highlights. The cinematography was a pleasant surprise, as the shots tend to be very much in the style of old Hammer Horror films (Horror film buffs should keep an eye out for shots that resemble some of your old favorites). The soundtrack is a nice mix of Danny Elfman's score and 70s rock. This is used to great effect throughout the movie (most notably Nights in White Satin).The film is not Burton's best, nor is it Depp's (Both of which would be Ed Wood in my opinion). It is an entertaining film, nothing particularly special... but there's a sense of nostalgia to it... Both for fans of the show and old Burton fans.Recommended for fans of Burton/Depp or those who liked old Hammer Horror films.",4,Something of a surprise,1349136000,"10 2, 2012",2012,2080,"['had', 'two', 'big', 'surprises', 'when', 'started', 'watching', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'First', 'trailer', 'was', 'very', 'misleading', 'trailers', 'made', 'film', 'look', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'complete', 'comedy', 'Much', 'delight', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'lot', 'darker', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'have', 'problem', 'comedies', 'felt', 'making', 'completely', 'comedic', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'original', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'TV', 'show', 'comedic', 'elements', 'were', 'not', 'main', 'draw.The', 'second', 'surprise', 'was', 'felt', 'older', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'film', 'Now', 'when', 'say', 'mean', 'return', 'more', 'macabre', 'films', 'recent', 'output', 'Burton', 'always', 'been', 'best', 'mind', 'when', 'dealing', 'horror', 'elements', 'such', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'even', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'classic', 'horror', 'films', 'plays', 'tropes', ""n't"", 'been', 'doing', 'much', 'recently', 'exception', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'Other', 'been', 'doing', 'more', 'family', 'friendly', 'films', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'come', 'mind', 'do', ""n't"", 'capture', 'feel', 'older', 'films', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'trying', 'something', 'new', 'return', 'classic', 'Burton.The', 'film', 'fairly', 'well', 'funny', 'bits', 'are', 'funny', 'scary', 'bits', 'are', 'well', 'guess', 'could', 'unnerve', 'people', 'Burton', 'usual', 'color', 'scheme', 'effect', 'so', 'expect', 'lot', 'dark', 'colors', 'red', 'highlights', 'cinematography', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'shots', 'tend', 'be', 'very', 'much', 'style', 'old', 'Hammer', 'Horror', 'films', 'Horror', 'film', 'buffs', 'should', 'keep', 'eye', 'out', 'shots', 'resemble', 'old', 'favorites', 'soundtrack', 'nice', 'mix', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'score', '70s', 'rock', 'used', 'great', 'effect', 'movie', 'most', 'notably', 'Nights', 'White', 'Satin', '.The', 'film', 'not', 'Burton', 'best', 'Depp', 'Both', 'would', 'be', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'opinion', 'entertaining', 'film', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'special', 'sense', 'nostalgia', 'fans', 'show', 'old', 'Burton', 'fans.Recommended', 'fans', 'Burton/Depp', 'who', 'liked', 'old', 'Hammer', 'Horror', 'films']",N/A

After refusing the advances of Angelique Bouchard (Green), Barnabas Collins (Depp) is cursed with eternal life by being turned a vampire and being buried alive. 200 years later he is accidentally awoken and returns to the manor his family built where he meets his descendants. He soon discovers that his relatives do not have perfect lives either and begins to try and change the fortunes of the Collins family. I have to put a disclaimer on this review by saying that I am not a Johnny Depp fan and am really getting sick of him playing the same role over and over. Having said that this movie is deceiving. The preview made it seem like it was a comedy, while there are funny parts this is not really a straight comedy. I never saw the TV show so I wasn't sure what to expect but to me the movie had the feel of less funny ""Death Becomes Her"" as far as comedy goes. To me the best parts were the old maid who doesn't speak at all and the soundtrack (as well as Alice Cooper). There were some pretty funny lines and Depp did do a good job but this is his typical character lately so I can't really be impressed by his acting. I will admit though that if you are a Johnny Depp fan then you will probably really enjoy this movie and totally disagree with my review. As far as my feelings I thought it was a little slow moving and seemed confused as to whether it wanted to be funny or not. Overall, fans of Depp will probably love this, I thought it was a little less then OK and a carbon copy of every other Depp/Burton movie.

1471086,AYB0IXBPBJ20A,B005LAIHKY,"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee""","[5, 8]","They're creepy and they're kooky, mysterious and...oh, that's another crazy horror TV family. Dark Shadows has managed to achieve some measure of cult status thanks to its quirky, macabre premise, more so than for any claim to being good. It was unique at least, as fairly serious goth soap operas featuring monsters and parallel universes are kinda hard to come by nowadays. You won't have to look hard to find the yearly Dark Shadows Festival, and the show has been attempted as a remake on more than one occasion. They all failed. Let's face it, remaking a series that seems to defy typical genre conventions is a tough act. Since most people have no clue what the heck Dark Shadows was, and a TV series is a proven failure, what's the best way to make use of this niche property? Make a movie out of it.Unfortunately that seems to be the only consideration at play in this tired and disappointing version of Dark Shadows, made even worse by the presence of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, who on paper would seem to be the perfect fit. Over the years, Burton has strayed further away from original material, shutting off much of his creative genius in order to bring to life the vision of others, and this would be the best evidence that all those years away have caused him to lose his touch. The same goes for Depp, who in his eighth collaboration(!!!) with Burton has fallen into the same comfortable formula as him. Burton appears perfectly happy to apply his talents to substandard, franchise friendly material. Depp, who has spent more time playing goofball characters than actual human beings, has reached the point where it looks as if he's not even trying anymore.This Dark Shadows bears many of the hallmarks of the original series, Burton-ized for maximum marketability. That's not to say that making an obviously mainstream film is a bad thing. It's just that what made Burton so special is that he could do it without it ever feeling like he was compromising his artistic vision. Those days, sadly, are gone, traded in for half-hearted love triangles and lazy culture clash jokes sprinkled with spiffy 1970s rock tunes. The film begins promisingly in 1760, where the Collins clan have uprooted themselves and moved to Maine, where they began a thriving seafood company that powers the entire town's economy. They're so beloved that the town actually becomes known as Collinsport, but that's about where all the good cheer ends. Young Barnabas Collins(Depp) has become the object of desire of their servant girl, Angelique(Eva Green), and he has given in to passion with her on numerous occasions, even though he has found true love with the beautiful Josette(Bella Heathcote). When Barnabas tries to break things off with Angelique, she gets revenge by casting a murderous spell on Josette, destroying the Collins family, and cursing Barnabas as a vampire. Oh, and then she has him buried alive.Fast forward a couple of hundred years to 1972, and the Collins family is still feeling the effects of Angelique's curse. The once stately Collins Manor has fallen into disarray, broken and disheveled. The family business is in tatters, with the surviving Angelique using the years to take over the seafood industry for herself, sending the Collins' into ruin. All that remains of the family are a handful of heirs with secrets and quirks galore: the regal matriarch, Elizabeth Collins Stoddard(Michelle Pfeiffer); her insufferable, gold-digging brother(Johnny Lee Miller); the rebellious teenage daughter, Carolyn(Chloe Moretz); and the troubled 10-year old son, David(Gully McGrath). Things begin to turn around with the arrival of Victoria Winters(Heathcote again) as the new governess, who happens to be the spitting image of Josette. When Barnabas is accidentally unearthed from his grave(and promptly slaughters everyone nearby), he rejoins the family and sets out to restore them to their greater glory.Of course it won't be easy, especially when Barnabas quickly falls for Victoria, and she seems drawn mysteriously to him. Like a replay from their youth, Angelique jealously does everything in her power to steal Barnabas away, inciting a rivalry between her and the Collins clan that threatens to consume the town. What could have been a hilarious and spirited war between supernatural foes, mixed with Burton's freakish flair for the dramatic, turns out to be a one-note affair. Much of the humor derives for Barnabas's inability to adapt to modern times, spazzing out over the ""tiny songstress"" singing on the television. He's generally lost in the cultural freedom of the time period, although he seems to have the ""free love"" ideal down pretty well. Burton, along with horror novelist turned screenwriter Seth Grahame-Smith(Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter), mine the fish out of water humor for all it's worth. They're actually quite funny for awhile, but like most of Depp's impersonations they wear thin really quick. It doesn't help that the rest of the Collins clan are basically ignored, seen only when reacting to some misstep Barnabas has made. Moretz, a fantastic and mature young actress is badly miscast as Carolyn, a vampy bit of jailbait with a snotty attitude and great ""birthing hips"". Not even Helena Bonham Carter, such a staple and a highlight of many Burton movies, has much to do here as the family psychiatrist, Dr. Julia Hoffman. The most interesting thing about her, other than the momentary ""fling"" she has with the over-sexed Barnabas, is her blazing scarlet hair. Only Eva Green's busty and sinful performance as Angelique has any hint of life to it. She can curse me anytime she wants. We just aren't given much of a reason to care about anybody, and that includes Barnabas.The fundamental problem is the inability to blend the show's campy, soap opera elements with Burton's rather specific sort of black comedy. The tone is all over the map, from dark and rather vicious, to downright silly. Sometimes this can be a good thing, and Burton has shown many times he can usually find a way to make these elements work in perfect harmony. He never pulls it off here, though, and a big part of the problem is Graham-Smith's haphazard writing. Having read both of his popular, genre mash-up novels, that inconsistency is a recurring theme. He's a writer with a lot of cool ideas but little clue how to pull them off. That fits what happens to Dark Shadows to a tee. There's so much potential here, from the concept to the cast, that it's aggravating to sit and watch it go absolutely nowhere. At least it looks like a Burton film. He certainly hasn't lost his touch for art and production design.Burton and Depp have stated in the past how they were huge fans of theTV series, and it's mainly due to them that this film exists. They must've only really enjoyed the occasional episode or two, because it quickly becomes apparent that they have no idea where a Dark Shadows movie should lead. Clocking in at a ponderous 113 minutes, you start to feel every second of it, and the ending indicates the possibility of sequels. Rather than going in that direction, maybe Burton and Depp should just get together and pop in the Blu-Rays for a weekend marathon.",2,Depp and Burton have lost their touch,1336694400,"05 11,

But it is a Burton / Depp film anyway, which means you have great visuals and an eccentric character Depp plays with a heavy make-up just like in ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and ""Alice in Wonderland."" Frankly, I was not much impressed with either of them. Now with ""Dark Shadows"" their efforts are getting formulaic.""Dark Shadows"" is a typical case of ""pieces better than the whole."" Johnny Depp plays Barnabas Collins, a well-to-do 18th century gentleman turned into a vampire, who, after being confined in a coffin for about 200 years, wakes up again in 1972 (one year after the original TV show ended). To watch Depp's Barnabas amazed by the 1970s pop culture is just fun. The Alice Cooper concert scene (played by himself) is one of the film's highlights.Unfortunately, it seems the writer Seth Grahame-Smith (known for his book ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"") didn't come up with a coherent narrative for the protagonist Barnabas, who is not exactly a likeable person. Some may say the unfaithful womanizer well deserves the ""curse."" He also kills innocent people like Sweeney Todd. Unlike the film of the murderous barber of Fleet Street (directed by Burton), however, ""Dark Shadows"" does not give us any single reason for us to care for the film's hero.The supporting players include Helena Bonham Carter, Eva Green, Jackie Earle Haley, Jonny Lee Miller, Chlo Grace Moretz and Michelle Pfeiffer. Except Eva Green as the ""evil"" witch Angelique, completely overshadowing Bella Heathcote's heroine(s), none of them is memorable. Perhaps Tim Burton is not really interested.""Dark Shadows"" is one of the most disappointing Tim Burton films, in a sense as bad as his ""re-imagined"" version of ""Planet of the Apes.""

Thankfully he is released in 1972 when the music is great. Imagine him released from the grave in the mid 90's with all the rap music we could have to endure throughout the movie.
