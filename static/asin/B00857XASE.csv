There's nothing funny about it (unless you're in the 4th grade and find profanity and vulgarity for its own sake hilarious, or you find gay humor funny).  And it is certainly a let down as a vampire film as well.  Not sure what was trying to be accomplished, but I couldn't even make it through 20 minutes.Bad acting, poor writing, and worse directing.

It is a new way of looking at the vampires to see how they come up with this stuff is beyond me but I usually shy away from vampire movies as they have a tendency to be the same and boring but some are not like the blade trilogy.  I will continue to watch this movie once in a while or maybe twice a year but when I feel like it and I don't have to have space to store the dvd or worry about a dvd player breaking down.  Its always on amazon and I have no intention of ever closing my account with amazon.,5,good movie,1392681600,"02 18, 2014",2014,582,"['got', 'movie', 'amazon', 'instant', 'videos', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'dvd', 'new', 'way', 'looking', 'vampires', 'see', 'how', 'come', 'up', 'stuff', 'usually', 'shy', 'away', 'vampire', 'movies', 'have', 'tendency', 'be', 'same', 'boring', 'are', 'not', 'blade', 'trilogy', 'will', 'continue', 'watch', 'movie', 'once', 'while', 'maybe', 'twice', 'year', 'when', 'feel', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'have', 'space', 'store', 'dvd', 'worry', 'dvd', 'player', 'breaking', 'down', 'always', 'amazon', 'have', 'intention', 'ever', 'closing', 'account', 'amazon']",Vamperifica

1546365,A1SMSJ8UYB0BQD,B00857XASE,Fidel Rodriguez,"[1, 1]","The story is that a young man learns that he's a reincarnated vampire king. The story is flimsy at best and you can pretty much discard it. In fact, just about every effort to insert the premise behind why he's targeted to be turned into a vampire is kind of distracting and almost pointless. Ladies and gentlemen. Here's the real story: Young flamboyant man becomes a vampire. The rest of the movie is kind of just killing people.I'm a fan of vampire movies so I thought I'd try it out. It's not what I expected, but I found it entertaining, though I feel like it missed it's mark. As I mentioned earlier the story is heavily flawed and and because of this, the movie is just held together by the main character. Martin Yurkovic plays Carmen, a failed actor who is &#34;turned&#34; by 2 vampires who knew him in a previous incarnation. His role is that of a flamboyant and mildly aggressive homosexual man who is besties with a girl and a straight guy. I feel like Martin turned a crappy character into something half entertaining, though I don't think I ever actually laughed. Most of my enjoyment was just watching his antics. Dark humor, at times almost slapstick.Oh the actual movie was horrible. I think if the story was actually good, you'd notice the other actors, who were mostly terrible. 3 stars for originality, though. Plus there was no sparkly vampires or tortured souls. That was refreshing.",3,It's kind of gay.
