1544868,A3R7PQAHD3NZM0,B0082SINT2,Autumn Blues Reviews,"[12, 12]","Originally released by the Hallmark Channel in 2007. You've Got a Friend is a heartwarming tale of friendship found in the least expected places. Bobby Graham is a twelve-year-old boy who has been shuffled to a new town and placed under the care of his aunt and uncle after the death of his parents in a car accident. While his uncle seems uncomfortable with the whole parenting situation he has been thrown into he tries as best he knows how to raise and discipline Bobby. In his new school Bobby immediately becomes the target of the school bully which leads him into some trouble. At home when Bobby shows interest in soapbox racing his uncle feels it is a waste of time and refuses help his nephew in his interests. This leads Bobby into more trouble when he  lies to cover up the only person willing to help him, his new friend, the town recluse (Jim) and only person who is now helping him fulfill his dreams. However Jim (John Schneider) a former soapbox derby champion as a child, has emotional skelotons of his own he has chosen to hide. Which has led him to being shunned by his town for acting different since coming back from serving in Vietnam. While at first Jim is relucant to help Bobby he later begins to open up and mentor Bobby. In the end Jim and Bobby come to have more in common then they first realize.I found this film to be very predictable yet there are many lessons taught in the film. Those of which include not to judge others, one can find friendship with those we least expect to find it with, we all make mistakes and people come into our life for a reason, amongst many others. A great family film this movie is for parents to share with their children to help teach them about relationships, friendship, love and most importantly self-confidence. I feel kids can really connect with Bobby, feel for him and his situation, while learning that no matter how bad life can get, if they work hard they can overcome those obstacles and make the best of it.",5,Sometimes friendship develops where least expected when we need it the most.,1345420800,"08 20, 2012",2012,1984,"['Originally', 'released', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', '2007', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Friend', 'heartwarming', 'tale', 'friendship', 'found', 'least', 'expected', 'places', 'Bobby', 'Graham', 'twelve-year-old', 'boy', 'who', 'been', 'shuffled', 'new', 'town', 'placed', 'care', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'death', 'parents', 'car', 'accident', 'uncle', 'uncomfortable', 'whole', 'parenting', 'situation', 'been', 'thrown', 'as', 'best', 'how', 'raise', 'discipline', 'Bobby', 'new', 'school', 'Bobby', 'immediately', 'target', 'school', 'bully', 'trouble', 'home', 'when', 'Bobby', 'interest', 'soapbox', 'racing', 'uncle', 'feels', 'waste', 'time', 'help', 'nephew', 'interests', 'Bobby', 'more', 'trouble', 'when', 'cover', 'up', 'only', 'person', 'willing', 'help', 'new', 'friend', 'town', 'recluse', 'Jim', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'now', 'helping', 'fulfill', 'dreams', 'However', 'Jim', 'John', 'Schneider', 'former', 'soapbox', 'derby', 'champion', 'child', 'emotional', 'skelotons', 'own', 'chosen', 'hide', 'Which', 'led', 'being', 'shunned', 'town', 'acting', 'different', 'coming', 'back', 'serving', 'Vietnam', 'first', 'Jim', 'relucant', 'help', 'Bobby', 'later', 'open', 'up', 'mentor', 'Bobby', 'end', 'Jim', 'Bobby', 'come', 'have', 'more', 'common', 'then', 'first', 'realize.I', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'very', 'predictable', 'yet', 'are', 'many', 'lessons', 'taught', 'film', 'include', 'not', 'judge', 'others', 'one', 'can', 'find', 'friendship', 'least', 'expect', 'find', 'make', 'mistakes', 'people', 'come', 'life', 'reason', 'amongst', 'many', 'others', 'great', 'family', 'film', 'movie', 'parents', 'share', 'children', 'help', 'teach', 'relationships', 'friendship', 'love', 'most', 'importantly', 'self-confidence', 'feel', 'kids', 'can', 'really', 'connect', 'Bobby', 'feel', 'situation', 'learning', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'life', 'can', 'get', 'work', 'hard', 'can', 'overcome', 'obstacles', 'make', 'best']",N/A

On top of this I loved the relationship that you see that develops between Bobby and Jim and you come to find that even though at first you think it is Bobby that needs Jim, that instead it really is the other way around.

You can see the set up for a whole lot of healing and more coming a mile away.You've Got A Friend starring one of my childhood crushes John Schneider so I was already excited before it even started.John Schneider plays Jim, a Viet Name Vet who was a Derby Car champion. Dylan McLaughlin, an adorable, sweet looking boy plays Bobby Graham, a smart, kid who is looking for someone to help him with a Derby car, something he and his dad were working on before his father's death.  He tries to get his Uncle Jeff to help but Jeff is busying running his hardware store and has some underlying anger toward Derby.I will never understand movies where a child loses their family and has to deal with such negativity. Thankfully, Bobby's teacher and Jim care deeply for Bobby and want to make sure he is happy and doesn't feel alone! Thankfully, it doesn't take long before his Uncle comes around and everyone is happy.Does Bobby win the Derby?
