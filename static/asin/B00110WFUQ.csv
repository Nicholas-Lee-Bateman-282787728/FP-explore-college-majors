1128643,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B00110WFUQ,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[0, 0]","Two outstanding pictures with a moral message.  This set contains the films ""FACING THE GIANTS"" & ""FLYWHEEL"" created by the people behind the current outstanding theater HIT, ""FIREPROOF.""  I wholeheartedly recommend all three movies to everyone, including my own children and their families.You will see some of the same ""stars"" performing different roles in each of these stories.  This Georgia movie-making congregation is cranking out quality without Hollywood.  While you're waiting on the release of ""Fireproof"" on DVD, get this set and enjoy both.  Don't let the NOT RATED scare you.  No one swears, kills, is nude, or any of the other ""suggested musts"" of the traditional movie producers.  This is good, funny, inspirational, touching, spiritual, joyful...well...it's all good.AWESOME job by Sherwood Pictures and the writing, producing, directing, and acting of the Kendrick brothers.  There is even lots of good special feature extras showing how they do it in Georgia.",5,FAMILY CHRISTIAN ENTERTAINMENT FOR ANY AGE,1226102400,"11 8, 2008",2008,978,"['Two', 'outstanding', 'pictures', 'moral', 'message', 'set', 'films', 'GIANTS', 'FLYWHEEL', 'created', 'people', 'current', 'outstanding', 'theater', 'HIT', 'FIREPROOF', 'wholeheartedly', 'recommend', 'three', 'movies', 'everyone', 'including', 'own', 'children', 'families.You', 'will', 'see', 'same', 'stars', 'performing', 'different', 'roles', 'stories', 'Georgia', 'movie-making', 'congregation', 'cranking', 'out', 'quality', 'Hollywood', ""'re"", 'waiting', 'release', 'Fireproof', 'DVD', 'get', 'set', 'enjoy', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'NOT', 'RATED', 'scare', 'one', 'swears', 'kills', 'nude', 'other', 'suggested', 'musts', 'traditional', 'movie', 'producers', 'good', 'funny', 'inspirational', 'touching', 'spiritual', 'joyful', 'well', 'good.AWESOME', 'job', 'Sherwood', 'Pictures', 'writing', 'producing', 'directing', 'acting', 'Kendrick', 'brothers', 'even', 'lots', 'good', 'special', 'feature', 'extras', 'showing', 'how', 'do', 'Georgia']",Facing the Giants / Flywheel Director's Cut  Two-Pack
1128644,A1ZSWL641H5018,B00110WFUQ,"Marie44 ""marie44""","[0, 0]","In ""Flywheel"", a car salesman listens to his wife (smart man!) and puts God first in his life, runnning his business with honesty and integrity. He eventually reaps great rewards, both spiritual and financial. The struggles he goes through and the perseverance demonstrated in doing what is right when it seems he is failing, and in the relationships that are built during those times, is inspiring. In ""Facing the Giants"", a man learns how to be a great football coach, inspires his team and others, and persists in taking the high road even when the odds are against him. What happens between a son (one of the players) and his father is a very poignant resolution of a healed relationship. The only thing I didn't like about this movie was the emphasis on the couple (coach and wife) trying so hard to have a baby. I thought that depicted them as very  irresponsible since they couldn't even afford to fix their car and his job prospects seemed so unstable. I loved the way he talked with his players and colleagues and others, not hiding his faith, but I can't imagine that kind of talking being allowed at a public school without someone complaining about it. If you can ignore the part about the couple being irresponsible and can imagine talk about God and scripture used at a school, you will really enjoy this movie.",5,Two faith-promoting movies,1245974400,"06 26, 2009",2009,1325,"['Flywheel', 'car', 'salesman', 'wife', 'smart', 'man', 'God', 'first', 'life', 'runnning', 'business', 'honesty', 'integrity', 'eventually', 'great', 'rewards', 'spiritual', 'financial', 'struggles', 'perseverance', 'demonstrated', 'doing', 'what', 'right', 'when', 'failing', 'relationships', 'are', 'built', 'times', 'inspiring', 'Facing', 'Giants', 'man', 'how', 'be', 'great', 'football', 'coach', 'team', 'others', 'persists', 'taking', 'high', 'road', 'even', 'when', 'odds', 'are', 'What', 'son', 'one', 'players', 'father', 'very', 'poignant', 'resolution', 'healed', 'relationship', 'only', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'was', 'emphasis', 'couple', 'coach', 'wife', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'have', 'baby', 'thought', 'depicted', 'very', 'irresponsible', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'afford', 'fix', 'car', 'job', 'prospects', 'seemed', 'so', 'unstable', 'loved', 'way', 'talked', 'players', 'colleagues', 'others', 'not', 'hiding', 'faith', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'kind', 'talking', 'being', 'allowed', 'public', 'school', 'someone', 'complaining', 'can', 'ignore', 'part', 'couple', 'being', 'irresponsible', 'can', 'imagine', 'talk', 'God', 'scripture', 'used', 'school', 'will', 'really', 'enjoy', 'movie']",Facing the Giants / Flywheel Director's Cut  Two-Pack
