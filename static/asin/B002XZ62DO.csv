Debra is extremely encouraging, the music is very motivating, and the workout is fast and energetic!After about 40 minutes of various walk/step moves, we switch to the ""toning"" which also moves at a brisk pace (side knee lifts, etc.) The toning is followed by another approx. 10-minute fast walk. I didn't think I'd want to walk again after stopping for toning, but the toning moved quickly enough that I didn't feel too ""cooled"" to do another burst of walking. There are about FIVE PRE-MIXES as well, from a 15-minute (or so) walk to just over an hour!

1298865,A2BF2OUBWDGSZK,B002XZ62DO,TamarinaDC,"[6, 6]","I bought this video based on the reccomendations online, particularly those people who said that they had become bored by Leslie Sansone's dependence on her 4 basic moves.  The DVD is to be commended for offering a number of ways to view the exercizes, including a number of ""pre-mixes"".  I chose the 50 minute premix because I usually had been doing LS's 3 mile 40-45 minute walks and figured that 50 minutes would be pretty close.  Once I got over Debra's NY/Philly accent and recognized walker Angel as a model/host from QVC, I got into the exercize. There were a number of new moves to learn, which were fun (the Sashay, the Wedding March, the Starburst), but they weren't explained very well- I think, though, that that is a function of the ""premix"", because presumably if you watched the video from beginning to end in the manner it was filmed, you'd know the steps and not need so much instruction.  The workout took longer for me to break a sweat, but once I did, the sweat just kept coming (particularly with  Debra's ""quick feet"" and ""leg lifts""- they sound innocent, but they will kick your butt).  The cooldown stretch didn't include a stretch or the lower leg, which I certainly could have used after the calf nightmare that is ""quick feet"".  Overall, I'll use this occasionally to supplement my LS taapes, but I'm not replacing them entirely- I like LS, and don't have any propblem with her repetition (plus, I alternate betweeen a number of her workouts with their various ""boosters"", including the stretchy band, the walk belt, the weighted belt, and the hand weights- I never get bored because I'm using them in rotation). But I will add Debra to the mix every once in a while when I feel like shaking my hips.",4,A worthwile addition to my DVD collection,1318982400,"10 19, 2011",2011,1727,"['bought', 'video', 'based', 'reccomendations', 'online', 'particularly', 'people', 'who', 'said', 'had', 'become', 'bored', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'dependence', '4', 'basic', 'moves', 'DVD', 'be', 'commended', 'offering', 'number', 'ways', 'view', 'exercizes', 'including', 'number', 'pre-mixes', 'chose', '50', 'minute', 'premix', 'usually', 'had', 'been', 'doing', 'LS', '3', 'mile', '40-45', 'minute', 'walks', 'figured', '50', 'minutes', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'close', 'Once', 'got', 'Debra', 'NY/Philly', 'accent', 'recognized', 'walker', 'Angel', 'model/host', 'QVC', 'got', 'exercize', 'were', 'number', 'new', 'moves', 'learn', 'were', 'fun', 'Sashay', 'Wedding', 'March', 'Starburst', 'were', ""n't"", 'explained', 'very', 'well-', 'think', 'though', 'function', 'premix', 'presumably', 'watched', 'video', 'beginning', 'end', 'manner', 'was', 'filmed', ""'d"", 'know', 'steps', 'not', 'need', 'so', 'much', 'instruction', 'workout', 'took', 'longer', 'break', 'sweat', 'once', 'did', 'sweat', 'just', 'kept', 'coming', 'particularly', 'Debra', 'quick', 'feet', 'leg', 'lifts', 'sound', 'innocent', 'will', 'kick', 'butt', 'cooldown', 'stretch', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'stretch', 'lower', 'leg', 'certainly', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'calf', 'nightmare', 'quick', 'feet', 'Overall', ""'ll"", 'use', 'occasionally', 'supplement', 'LS', 'taapes', ""'m"", 'not', 'replacing', 'entirely-', 'like', 'LS', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'propblem', 'repetition', 'alternate', 'number', 'workouts', 'various', 'boosters', 'including', 'stretchy', 'band', 'walk', 'belt', 'weighted', 'belt', 'hand', 'weights-', 'never', 'get', 'bored', ""'m"", 'using', 'rotation', 'will', 'add', 'Debra', 'mix', 'once', 'while', 'when', 'feel', 'shaking', 'hips']",SHAPELY GIRL: WALKING FIT and FABULOUS!
1298866,A39MD3N21Z8OUU,B002XZ62DO,The Mrs.,"[29, 29]","I must say that each workout that Debra releases just gets better! I have her 3 previous DVDs and all I love dearly; Lets Get Stepping is my favorite. After doing this DVD, I can honestly say that it's a tie now for my Favorite Debra DVD bwt this one and her Step Aerobics workout. If you are a Leslie Fan or like me, tired of Leslie and her monotonous workouts, this is a must have and a breath of fresh air for any in-home walking program! Debra has an instant hit on her hands with this one! Her laughter and interaction alone with the cast brings a smile to my face and makes me want to put more of myself into the workout.IMO this DVD is more Intermediate than Beginner and can easily be made Advanced by adding plyometrics and weights gloves/belts. The choreography starts basic and gets more ""complex"" as the DVD progresses. The complexity of the movements is still easy to catch onto and really makes the time fly! My favorite moves being the Tri-Star (not Cathe Friedrich's or Firm's Tri-Star) and the Wedding March. The majority of the moves are low impact but can be made high impact for more of a burn or harder workout. There is no TIFTing in this DVD or in her earlier 3. Her cast is inspiring and fun; Tonya being my personal fav as I can relate to her story which she says in Circle Time. Being a Shapely Girl myself, a size 14, I LOVE having DVDs that I can do with other women that look like me, have been in my shoes, and know my struggles. Just because we may be ""larger"" doesn't mean we are not physically fit or can become so! Circle Time at the end of the DVD is the best yet and it really will speak to so many women. I am healthy at a 14 and I love being able to workout with Debra and DVDs that I find absolutely fun with no DREAD factor what so ever. I looked at the clock at minute 15 and before I knew it, we were onto the AB Section and final stretch!The Ab section is more about overall core work using a lot of balance and stability moves. This isn't the ""6 Pack Abs"" workout, but it is one that will promote better posture and better overall core function. Some of these moves my Physical Therapist has me doing already. The day after doing the ab section, mind you really focusing on the movements, I could feel my obliques and other muscles were sore. This was not something I had expected from her standing ab routine, and was a welcome surprise. This is a fabulous DVD, better than ANY Leslie DVD IMHO; God I am never going back to that woman's workouts!! With workouts like this there is no need to do the same old and boring 4 basic steps! There is variety galore! Debra is the best and I am so happy that I made another investment with her. She's changed my life and will change yours too. Whether you're a Size 2 or 22, Debra is the perfect instructor. FYI for those beginners, if the movements are too tricky at first, as always she mentions to go back to the March and watch and practice. I love how she says ""Quitting is not an option, you can slow down, but you CANNOT quit!""",5,Another Favorite and instand hit from Debra!!!,1251072000,"08 24, 2009",2009,3020,"['must', 'say', 'workout', 'Debra', 'just', 'better', 'have', '3', 'previous', 'DVDs', 'love', 'dearly', 'Lets', 'Get', 'Stepping', 'favorite', 'doing', 'DVD', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'tie', 'now', 'Favorite', 'Debra', 'DVD', 'bwt', 'one', 'Step', 'Aerobics', 'workout', 'are', 'Leslie', 'Fan', 'tired', 'Leslie', 'monotonous', 'workouts', 'must', 'have', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'in-home', 'walking', 'program', 'Debra', 'instant', 'hit', 'hands', 'one', 'laughter', 'interaction', 'alone', 'cast', 'smile', 'face', 'want', 'put', 'more', 'workout.IMO', 'DVD', 'more', 'Intermediate', 'Beginner', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'made', 'Advanced', 'adding', 'plyometrics', 'weights', 'gloves/belts', 'choreography', 'basic', 'more', 'complex', 'DVD', 'complexity', 'movements', 'still', 'easy', 'catch', 'onto', 'really', 'time', 'fly', 'favorite', 'moves', 'being', 'Tri-Star', 'not', 'Cathe', 'Friedrich', 'Firm', 'Tri-Star', 'Wedding', 'March', 'majority', 'moves', 'are', 'low', 'impact', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'high', 'impact', 'more', 'burn', 'harder', 'workout', 'TIFTing', 'DVD', 'earlier', '3', 'cast', 'inspiring', 'fun', 'Tonya', 'being', 'personal', 'fav', 'can', 'relate', 'story', 'Circle', 'Time', 'Being', 'Shapely', 'Girl', 'size', '14', 'LOVE', 'having', 'DVDs', 'can', 'do', 'other', 'women', 'look', 'have', 'been', 'shoes', 'know', 'struggles', 'Just', 'may', 'be', 'larger', ""n't"", 'mean', 'are', 'not', 'physically', 'fit', 'can', 'become', 'so', 'Circle', 'Time', 'end', 'DVD', 'best', 'yet', 'really', 'will', 'speak', 'so', 'many', 'women', 'am', 'healthy', '14', 'love', 'being', 'able', 'workout', 'Debra', 'DVDs', 'find', 'absolutely', 'fun', 'DREAD', 'factor', 'what', 'so', 'ever', 'looked', 'clock', 'minute', '15', 'knew', 'were', 'AB', 'Section', 'final', 'stretch', 'Ab', 'section', 'more', 'overall', 'core', 'work', 'using', 'lot', 'balance', 'stability', 'moves', ""n't"", '6', 'Pack', 'Abs', 'workout', 'one', 'will', 'promote', 'better', 'posture', 'better', 'overall', 'core', 'function', 'moves', 'Physical', 'Therapist', 'doing', 'already', 'day', 'doing', 'ab', 'section', 'mind', 'really', 'focusing', 'movements', 'could', 'feel', 'obliques', 'other', 'muscles', 'were', 'sore', 'was', 'not', 'something', 'had', 'expected', 'standing', 'ab', 'routine', 'was', 'welcome', 'surprise', 'fabulous', 'DVD', 'better', 'ANY', 'Leslie', 'DVD', 'IMHO', 'God', 'am', 'never', 'going', 'back', 'woman', 'workouts', 'workouts', 'need', 'do', 'same', 'old', 'boring', '4', 'basic', 'steps', 'variety', 'galore', 'Debra', 'best', 'am', 'so', 'happy', 'made', 'investment', 'changed', 'life', 'will', 'change', 'yours', 'too', 'Whether', ""'re"", 'Size', '2', '22', 'Debra', 'perfect', 'instructor', 'FYI', 'beginners', 'movements', 'are', 'too', 'tricky', 'first', 'always', 'go', 'back', 'March', 'watch', 'practice', 'love', 'how', 'Quitting', 'not', 'option', 'can', 'slow', 'down', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'quit']",SHAPELY GIRL: WALKING FIT and FABULOUS!

I don't want to do the Fit workout after the beginner as it starts you out at the beginning again, with another warm up.  I then switch to pre-mixes and chose standing ab workout.  Another warm up, but I do it and then the ab workout which is fine.  But she leaves out quite a few cues.  Also says, ""no arms,"" and proceeds to use her arms.
