How awesome was it? Flippin', that's how awesome it was. Basically I'm a man that doesn't believe in love, and this didn't make me believe in love or anything, but it sure was awesome. I very much enjoyed the DJ dude, he was so cool. And the babe, she was a fox. To be honest I was surprised at how much I liked this film. Very surprised. I don't even know why I watched it. It is by far definitely the best romantic movie I've ever seen in my life. Like I said, I don't believe in love, and so for all those guys that think most romantic stories are hokey, you might actually like this film. I guess the description caught my attention.

874771,A2MJHH2UJGNJOT,B0006VD398,Brandon,"[13, 14]","I was rather surprised by this movie. I usually am not the biggest fan of Romantic Comedies, but a friend of mine raved about this one, and the cinephile that I am, I decided to give it a shot. While it retained the feeling that no matter what happened, the romantic leads were inevitably going to end up together (I s'pose it's a romantic comedy, such things are inevitable), it managed to present this story in a very stylish way. Instead of confining the discussion to the romantic entaglements presented in the narratives, the film talked about things like the benefits and failings of routine.Of course at times it descended into the schmaltz of love letters, utterances of 'I want to spend the rest of my life with you', and the like, but--as my female friends inform me--this is an essential element of the genre. And there were some wonderful moments of truth such as an awkward conversation about the weather that turn into embers of romance, or a moment of quiet delight when the female lead tests out an indicator of love (it's all in the fingertips). For me the hightlight of the movie was the paralellism that was presented between love and mermaids. And the direction and cinematography weren't subservient to the story: each element was allowed to explore the themes in its own way without being an illustration of the feelings of the characters. All in all, it never stopped being a Romantic Comedy, but all the while, it managed to side step insufferability.",5,Not the typical Romantic Comedy,1271289600,"04 15, 2010",2010,1475,"['was', 'rather', 'surprised', 'movie', 'usually', 'am', 'not', 'biggest', 'fan', 'Romantic', 'Comedies', 'friend', 'mine', 'raved', 'one', 'cinephile', 'am', 'decided', 'give', 'shot', 'retained', 'feeling', 'matter', 'what', 'happened', 'romantic', 'leads', 'were', 'inevitably', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'together', ""s'pose"", 'romantic', 'comedy', 'such', 'things', 'are', 'inevitable', 'managed', 'present', 'story', 'very', 'stylish', 'way', 'Instead', 'confining', 'discussion', 'romantic', 'entaglements', 'presented', 'narratives', 'film', 'talked', 'things', 'benefits', 'failings', 'routine.Of', 'course', 'times', 'descended', 'schmaltz', 'love', 'letters', 'utterances', 'want', 'spend', 'rest', 'life', 'like', 'female', 'friends', 'inform', 'essential', 'element', 'genre', 'were', 'wonderful', 'moments', 'truth', 'such', 'awkward', 'conversation', 'weather', 'turn', 'embers', 'romance', 'moment', 'quiet', 'delight', 'when', 'female', 'lead', 'tests', 'out', 'indicator', 'love', 'fingertips', 'hightlight', 'movie', 'was', 'paralellism', 'was', 'presented', 'love', 'mermaids', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'were', ""n't"", 'subservient', 'story', 'element', 'was', 'allowed', 'explore', 'themes', 'own', 'way', 'being', 'illustration', 'feelings', 'characters', 'never', 'stopped', 'being', 'Romantic', 'Comedy', 'while', 'managed', 'side', 'step', 'insufferability']",The Republic of Love
874772,A23UB49EG29MVT,B0006VD398,Commenter77,"[3, 6]","A lot was said about this movie at the time it came out, indicating it was a touching love story.  Been skeptical of the general downturn in the genre, with a lot of indications that they have no clue what that's all about. But, thought I'd try again.  But, true to form, it ran to the now standard poor taste with an unpleasant aftertaste.  For starters - the kinky Indian music was too strange. Maybe the mermaid idea was considered an artsy touch as well.If the characters had been able to get over themselves, the viewer would have been able to breathe easier. The long looks - forget your lines? The oh-so-serious weighing of inner feelings about oneself, especially with Fay - grow up, kid. I think it's called analysis paralysis. Her brother had her number. Where does all that probative introspection get her? It's good she rallied around her mother when needed, but was it really necessary to spin into withdrawal? Lash out at Tom when he calls? She's a baby.  Someone really should have taken Tom's temperature. I think he was sick or was he just sleep walking? Just kind of drifts into things, including marriage. Use the brain. Get a pulse. Now, put the two together.These are supposed to be adult people who hold down real jobs. Their courtship and relating revolve mainly around the initial newness of meeting and cohabiting. Pretty flimsy deal they got going here. Not surprising that it doesn't weather the first ill wind that blows its way. I guess their parents failed them along the way, but what else is new? You are supposed to acquire some life skills beyond that on your own. You're grown up now (40ish, in his case), so why can't you handle anything? Where's the strength for someone else? Consumed on little me, actually. Good luck on the marriage (""I'm so happy!""). Unfortunately, it takes a lot more than that. Oh, please finally get with it, or just go back home and settle into sucking your thumbs in earnest.This is a downer about two losers likely to remain that way.",1,Pathetic But Unsympathetic Characters,1351814400,"11 2, 2012",2012,1998,"['lot', 'was', 'said', 'movie', 'time', 'came', 'out', 'indicating', 'was', 'touching', 'love', 'story', 'Been', 'skeptical', 'general', 'downturn', 'genre', 'lot', 'indications', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'thought', ""'d"", 'try', 'again', 'true', 'form', 'ran', 'now', 'standard', 'poor', 'taste', 'unpleasant', 'aftertaste', 'starters', 'kinky', 'Indian', 'music', 'was', 'too', 'strange', 'Maybe', 'mermaid', 'idea', 'was', 'considered', 'artsy', 'touch', 'well.If', 'characters', 'had', 'been', 'able', 'get', 'viewer', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'breathe', 'easier', 'long', 'forget', 'lines', 'oh-so-serious', 'weighing', 'inner', 'feelings', 'especially', 'Fay', 'grow', 'up', 'kid', 'think', 'called', 'analysis', 'paralysis', 'brother', 'had', 'number', 'Where', 'probative', 'introspection', 'get', 'good', 'rallied', 'mother', 'when', 'needed', 'was', 'really', 'necessary', 'spin', 'withdrawal', 'out', 'Tom', 'when', 'baby', 'Someone', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'Tom', 'temperature', 'think', 'was', 'sick', 'was', 'just', 'sleep', 'walking', 'Just', 'kind', 'drifts', 'things', 'including', 'marriage', 'Use', 'brain', 'Get', 'pulse', 'Now', 'put', 'two', 'together.These', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'adult', 'people', 'who', 'hold', 'down', 'real', 'jobs', 'courtship', 'relating', 'revolve', 'mainly', 'initial', 'newness', 'meeting', 'cohabiting', 'Pretty', 'flimsy', 'deal', 'got', 'going', 'here', 'Not', 'surprising', ""n't"", 'weather', 'first', 'ill', 'wind', 'way', 'guess', 'parents', 'failed', 'along', 'way', 'what', 'else', 'new', 'are', 'supposed', 'acquire', 'life', 'skills', 'own', ""'re"", 'grown', 'up', 'now', '40ish', 'case', 'so', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'anything', 'Where', 'strength', 'someone', 'else', 'Consumed', 'little', 'actually', 'Good', 'luck', 'marriage', ""'m"", 'so', 'happy', 'Unfortunately', 'lot', 'more', 'Oh', 'please', 'finally', 'get', 'just', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'settle', 'sucking', 'thumbs', 'earnest.This', 'downer', 'two', 'losers', 'likely', 'remain', 'way']",The Republic of Love
874773,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B0006VD398,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","The Republic of Love feels like it was a romantic date movie made in the 80's. The movie is good but sappy.There are too many conflicting influences on this film. It follows the cut and dried standard love story, will they get together, will they be happy, will they break up, how it all will end, etc. Every once in a while Bollywood intrudes. It has a bit of the Canadian indigenous culture (Gary Farmer - born into the Cayuga nation and Wolf Clan - played Ken the audio engineer and good friend, is a bright spot in this film - everybody should have a friend like Ken). The happy old couple that refuses to get married and imparts the freedom theory until something horrible happens. In the end, the mash up just didn't work for me at all.This film felt like a side project to keep the director, Deepa Mehta, busy between her three masterpiece films, Earth, Fire, and Water. The film was well made, but it got very lost in the message and character development. I mostly didn't really care what happened to the two lead characters.Film Movement is usually a slam dunk for me. The majority of their films are massive winners for me. Films I would have never watched in a million years and was so glad I saw them. The Republic of Love seems like they went for a big name and possible blockbuster, Deepa Mehta. Unfortunately, this just wasn't that film. To really understand how much I didn't care about this film, my wife and I accidently watched it twice, once a few years ago when I bought the DVD and just this week. There were certain scenes, mostly the ones with Gary Farmer in them, that we remembered; but we honestly both forgot the whole film.The DVD includes a ten minute short, Persistence. An old man in a wheel chair tries to leave a hospital. After the third try, it was a bit too repetitive. Even at ten minutes, the film was too long.The Republic of Love is not a bad film. It just isn't memorable. I think it had a lot of potential and never lived up to those expectations. There are so many incredible films in the Film Movement series, please move on to another one.",2,Sappy - I forgot that I've already seen this film,1376956800,"08 20, 2013",2013,2086,"['Republic', 'Love', 'feels', 'was', 'romantic', 'date', 'movie', 'made', '80', 'movie', 'good', 'sappy.There', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'conflicting', 'influences', 'film', 'cut', 'dried', 'standard', 'love', 'story', 'will', 'get', 'together', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'will', 'break', 'up', 'how', 'will', 'end', 'etc', 'once', 'while', 'Bollywood', 'intrudes', 'bit', 'Canadian', 'indigenous', 'culture', 'Gary', 'Farmer', 'born', 'Cayuga', 'nation', 'Wolf', 'Clan', 'played', 'Ken', 'audio', 'engineer', 'good', 'friend', 'bright', 'spot', 'film', 'everybody', 'should', 'have', 'friend', 'Ken', 'happy', 'old', 'couple', 'get', 'married', 'freedom', 'theory', 'something', 'horrible', 'happens', 'end', 'mash', 'up', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'all.This', 'film', 'felt', 'side', 'project', 'keep', 'director', 'Deepa', 'Mehta', 'busy', 'three', 'masterpiece', 'films', 'Earth', 'Fire', 'Water', 'film', 'was', 'well', 'made', 'got', 'very', 'lost', 'message', 'character', 'development', 'mostly', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'what', 'happened', 'two', 'lead', 'characters.Film', 'Movement', 'usually', 'slam', 'dunk', 'majority', 'films', 'are', 'massive', 'winners', 'Films', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'watched', 'million', 'years', 'was', 'so', 'glad', 'saw', 'Republic', 'Love', 'went', 'big', 'name', 'possible', 'blockbuster', 'Deepa', 'Mehta', 'Unfortunately', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'film', 'really', 'understand', 'how', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'film', 'wife', 'accidently', 'watched', 'twice', 'once', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'bought', 'DVD', 'just', 'week', 'were', 'certain', 'scenes', 'mostly', 'ones', 'Gary', 'Farmer', 'remembered', 'honestly', 'forgot', 'whole', 'film.The', 'DVD', 'ten', 'minute', 'short', 'Persistence', 'old', 'man', 'wheel', 'chair', 'tries', 'leave', 'hospital', 'third', 'try', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'repetitive', 'Even', 'ten', 'minutes', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'long.The', 'Republic', 'Love', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'memorable', 'think', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'never', 'lived', 'up', 'expectations', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'incredible', 'films', 'Film', 'Movement', 'series', 'please', 'move', 'one']",The Republic of Love
874774,A358AG4MJTFVTS,B0006VD398,E. Simpson,"[0, 0]","I love the bits that the negative reviewers either didn't get or care for. To me, the discrepancy in opinions is in part because the movie is Canadian, a number of the supporting cast are British, and the director is of Indian ethnicity - which makes this romantic comedy &#34;foreign&#34; for Americans. Frankly, it was those foreign elements that I loved. To me, the director's choice of Indian music was happily atypical because it was unexpected, fit the scenes it was in and added a sense of fun. The leads clicked with each other and made a believable couple with dignity as well as quirks. The humor is not low-brow and the acting is across-the-board intelligent. Greenwood is excellent as usual and looks fantastic. As for the reviewer who said the movie is not &#34;clean&#34; that reflects a very conservative standard. There are humorous sexual situations (including one I found hysterical), but absolutely no nudity and the scenes are shot tastefully. There is a lot that is funny in this film and if it doesn't say something profound, it does say something sweet about love, risk, commitment, and enchantment.

874775,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0006VD398,Grady Harp,"[15, 17]","THE REPUBLIC OF LOVE is yet another fine film from Canada based on Canadian Pulitzer Prize Winner (for 'The Stone Diaries') Carol Shields' novel by the same name, and written for the screen and directed by the gifted Deepa Mehta ('Earth', 'Fire', 'Water', etc). It is a satisfying story about the human boundaries set by/for love and how those 'republics' touch and clash and interact.Tom Avery (the very gifted actor Bruce Greenwood) was an illegitimate child, raised by a homemaker class as a teaching lesson in how young brides to be should learn the skills of tending house, who has grown up, married three times out of a need for belonging and for being loved, and is currently unattached, making his living as a night talk show host helping the lonely hearts.  Into his life steps the beautiful museum curator, currently involved in a Mermaid Exhibition, by the name of Fay (Emilia Fox) who remains single because of her exceptionally high demands for a partner.  The two meet, fall immediately in love at first sight, much to their individual surprise, and proceed with a courtship, while at the same time encountering and observing other couples (especially their parents) who seem to hold the winning medals for perfect marriage.Fay's parents (James Fox is Richard, the father) have just celebrated their anniversary when Richard abruptly decides to leave his wife.  Fay runs to her mother's rescue, leaving Tom alone and the apparent brunt of Fay's disillusion of marriage.  The changes that occur cause Tom to reflect on his history of marrying too often in unions that have not met with success. How Fay and Tom ultimately resolve the abutments of their personal 'republics' is the part of the story that carries the film.The entire cast includes some of Canada's finest actors and the film is solidly directed by Mehta.  There are aspects that disrupt the flow of the story, the main one being the incessant and very loud East Indian music that seems wholly out of place and is at best distracting (the score was written by Talvin Singh).  Mehta also elects to throw in some bizarre cutesy animation at the end that for this viewer cheapens the story. But flaws aside, this is a fine film graced by the presence of Bruce Greenwood and Emilia Fox. Recommended entry from Film Movement.

I did find some of the casual sex scenes funny (foot fetish for example).",3,Meditation on love and marriage,1212710400,"06 6, 2008",2008,1093,"['Film', 'three', 'couples', 'elderly', 'couple', 'who', 'have', 'spent', 'lives', 'together', 'being', 'married', 'couple', '40', 'years', 'marriage', 'middle', 'aged', 'couple', 'new', 'relatioship', 'crossroads', 'deciding', 'want', 'get', 'married', 'not', 'learn', 'relationships', 'are', 'never', 'what', 'seem', 'be', 'outsiders', 'What', 'be', 'perfect', '40-year', 'long', 'relationship', 'up', 'trial', 'separation', 'what', 'be', 'uncommited', 'casual', 'relationship', 'up', 'marriage', 'hospital', 'death', 'bed', 'young', 'couple', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'married', 'divorced', 'three', 'times', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'never', 'had', 'seemingly', 'strong', 'relationship', 'are', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'marriage', 'are', 'great', 'British', 'actors', 'ogf', 'older', 'generation', 'movie', 'Edward', 'Fox', 'Claire', 'Bloom', 'example', 'who', 'have', 'aged', 'so', 'much', 'almost', 'impossible', 'recognize', 'liked', 'mystic', 'indian', 'music', 'movie', 'fresh', 'infatuation', 'two', 'youngest', 'protagonists', 'too', 'sappy', 'time', 'did', 'find', 'casual', 'sex', 'scenes', 'funny', 'foot', 'fetish', 'example']",The Republic of Love

I hadn't read the novel to be able to make comparisons, but I can see how a lot probably had to be abbreviated. The two leads are excellent. Bruce Greenwood is one of my favorite actors, and it is only because he is so appealing that his character Tom (who has been married 3 times and impulsively falls in love and wants to marry immediately again) doesn't seem like the total suffocating mess he probably would be in real life, and actually seems like someone Fay could feel comfortable with.
