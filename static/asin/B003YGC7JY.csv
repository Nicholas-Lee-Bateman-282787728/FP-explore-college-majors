1376282,AZ2YLC0GWTAH2,B003YGC7JY,D.P.,"[2, 2]","Paul ""Big Show"" Wight plays Walter Kronk, a 32 year old orphan who's looks like a giant but it really just a child at heart &  accidently sets fire to the kitchen in the orphanage causing thousands of dollars of damage that will result in the place being shut down in a week if they don't get the money to begin repairs.  Elsewhere is a man named Eddie Sullivan (Mark Feuerstein) who's a mixed martial arts promoter who owes a heavy debt to Memphis Earl (Dennis Farina) & is trying to find a new fighter to win a tournament to get the money he needs to pay off the debt.  After meeting Walter, Eddie convinces the head nun Sister Francesca (Wendy Malick) that Walter could make the money as a MMA fighter in a tournament out in New Orleans & send him off on the road, for the first time in his life, with her assistant & Walter's friend Mary (Melora Hardin) as a chaperone.  From there they get attempt to build his reputation via the internet by fighting in the most unusual situations such as churches, backyard at a children's party, a bear at a carnival, and frat houses while running into issues of their own such as transportation issues, Eddie & Mary facing their past, Walter seeing this as his only opportunity to be a hero, and Memphis Earl & his fighter Redrum (Lester Speight) trying to stop them at all cost.Anyone who's seen Big Show on WWE television or the now famous Saturday Night Live episode back in 2000 knows that Show is funny doing the ""Chris Farley"" method in that he's a big softhearted guy who's just very clumsy & doesn't realise just how big he is at times leading to a lot of physical humor. Doing this led to show having some very funny moments like breaking the bed in the hotel room, walking into a ceiling fan (I can relate to that one), using a small bathroom on a bus, and riding in a motorcycle sidecar with sparks coming off the back.  As I stated earlier, this comedy relies more on physical humor more than punchlines & jokes as the acting wasn't much but I was still entertained at the end of the day.  In the end, this was WWE Studios first attempt at a comedy film & the movie did it's job in that I laughed & was entertained for the most part so this is definately worth checking out for a viewing.",3,WWE Studios First Comedy...And I Laughed,1290643200,"11 25, 2010",2010,2242,"['Paul', 'Big', 'Show', 'Wight', 'Walter', 'Kronk', '32', 'year', 'old', 'orphan', 'who', 'looks', 'giant', 'really', 'just', 'child', 'heart', 'accidently', 'fire', 'kitchen', 'orphanage', 'causing', 'thousands', 'dollars', 'damage', 'will', 'result', 'place', 'being', 'shut', 'down', 'week', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'money', 'begin', 'repairs', 'Elsewhere', 'man', 'named', 'Eddie', 'Sullivan', 'Mark', 'Feuerstein', 'who', 'mixed', 'martial', 'arts', 'promoter', 'who', 'heavy', 'debt', 'Memphis', 'Earl', 'Dennis', 'Farina', 'trying', 'find', 'new', 'fighter', 'win', 'tournament', 'get', 'money', 'pay', 'off', 'debt', 'meeting', 'Walter', 'Eddie', 'head', 'nun', 'Sister', 'Francesca', 'Wendy', 'Malick', 'Walter', 'could', 'make', 'money', 'MMA', 'fighter', 'tournament', 'out', 'New', 'Orleans', 'send', 'off', 'road', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'assistant', 'Walter', 'friend', 'Mary', 'Melora', 'Hardin', 'chaperone', 'get', 'attempt', 'build', 'reputation', 'internet', 'fighting', 'most', 'unusual', 'situations', 'such', 'churches', 'backyard', 'children', 'party', 'bear', 'carnival', 'frat', 'houses', 'running', 'issues', 'own', 'such', 'transportation', 'issues', 'Eddie', 'Mary', 'facing', 'past', 'Walter', 'seeing', 'only', 'opportunity', 'be', 'hero', 'Memphis', 'Earl', 'fighter', 'Redrum', 'Lester', 'Speight', 'trying', 'stop', 'cost.Anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'Big', 'Show', 'WWE', 'television', 'now', 'famous', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'episode', 'back', '2000', 'knows', 'Show', 'funny', 'doing', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'method', 'big', 'softhearted', 'guy', 'who', 'just', 'very', 'clumsy', ""n't"", 'realise', 'just', 'how', 'big', 'times', 'leading', 'lot', 'physical', 'humor', 'Doing', 'led', 'show', 'having', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'breaking', 'bed', 'hotel', 'room', 'walking', 'ceiling', 'fan', 'can', 'relate', 'one', 'using', 'small', 'bathroom', 'bus', 'riding', 'motorcycle', 'sidecar', 'sparks', 'coming', 'off', 'back', 'stated', 'earlier', 'comedy', 'more', 'physical', 'humor', 'more', 'punchlines', 'jokes', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'was', 'still', 'entertained', 'end', 'day', 'end', 'was', 'WWE', 'Studios', 'first', 'attempt', 'comedy', 'film', 'movie', 'did', 'job', 'laughed', 'was', 'entertained', 'most', 'part', 'definately', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'viewing']",Knucklehead

With the title that this film has I am sure you know what you are getting into. The best thing about this movie is that it is a family film. My little cuz and I have watched this a few times because she loves it.Walter Krunk [Big Show] is a full grown orphan is a mess that breaks all things around him, but he has a big heart. When an accident in the kitchen of the orphanage leaves the room burned down they are told they have ten days to fix it or be shut down. Enter Eddie Sullivan [Mark Feuerstein] a fighter manager who is in dept to the wrong people and needs to pay them back. When he finds Walter he takes the giant under his wing so that they can win some fights and hopefully they will both get the money they need.For the adult watching this it may not be a laugh out loud classic comedy but it is an enjoyable film. As for the kids they will love it, what is better than a big kind hearted giant who is very clumsy. This is a fun movie that actually has some decent fight scenes for a family flick. My cuz in particular loved the bear part, reminds me of the kid flicks from the 90's and such. You know like ""Kindergarten Cop"" and such, it just as that feeling about it.The Big Show makes for a great lead in this family friendly movie which makes sense given his comedic turns in the WWE. He delivers with his character very well and the physical comedy is well done. Feuerstein is good here as well playing a guy you should hate because of what he is doing but you root for him anyway. Will Patton and Dennis Farina were excellent additions to the film as was Wendie Malick as the head Nun [excellent] and Melora Hardin as well. This isn't the best movie ever but it is a good one especially for family viewing. There are some great special features here like the commentary that Show is actually on.",4,GOOD FAMILY FLICK,1358380800,"01 17, 2013",2013,2005,"['KNUCKLEHEADI', 'am', 'huge', 'wrestling', 'fan', 'huge', 'movie', 'fan', 'so', 'when', 'two', 'come', 'together', 'am', 'was', 'comedy', 'WWE', 'put', 'together', 'starring', 'Big', 'Show', 'typical', 'man', 'child', 'title', 'film', 'am', 'sure', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'family', 'film', 'little', 'cuz', 'have', 'watched', 'few', 'times', 'it.Walter', 'Krunk', '[', 'Big', 'Show', ']', 'full', 'grown', 'orphan', 'mess', 'things', 'big', 'heart', 'When', 'accident', 'kitchen', 'orphanage', 'room', 'burned', 'are', 'told', 'have', 'ten', 'days', 'fix', 'be', 'shut', 'down', 'Enter', 'Eddie', 'Sullivan', '[', 'Mark', 'Feuerstein', 'fighter', 'manager', 'who', 'dept', 'wrong', 'people', 'needs', 'pay', 'back', 'When', 'Walter', 'giant', 'wing', 'so', 'can', 'win', 'fights', 'hopefully', 'will', 'get', 'money', 'need.For', 'adult', 'watching', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'classic', 'comedy', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'kids', 'will', 'love', 'what', 'better', 'big', 'kind', 'hearted', 'giant', 'who', 'very', 'clumsy', 'fun', 'movie', 'actually', 'decent', 'fight', 'scenes', 'family', 'flick', 'cuz', 'particular', 'loved', 'bear', 'part', 'kid', '90', 'such', 'know', 'Kindergarten', 'Cop', 'such', 'just', 'feeling', 'it.The', 'Big', 'Show', 'great', 'lead', 'family', 'friendly', 'movie', 'sense', 'given', 'comedic', 'turns', 'WWE', 'character', 'very', 'well', 'physical', 'comedy', 'well', 'done', 'Feuerstein', 'good', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'playing', 'guy', 'should', 'hate', 'what', 'doing', 'root', 'anyway', 'Will', 'Patton', 'Dennis', 'Farina', 'were', 'excellent', 'additions', 'film', 'was', 'Wendie', 'Malick', 'head', 'Nun', '[', 'excellent', ']', 'Melora', 'Hardin', 'as', 'well', ""n't"", 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'good', 'one', 'especially', 'family', 'viewing', 'are', 'great', 'special', 'features', 'here', 'commentary', 'Show', 'actually']",Knucklehead
1376284,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B003YGC7JY,Jeffery Mingo,"[3, 4]","In an interview, Big Show admited, ""This is not 'Gone with the Wind.'""  So you have to go into this film in advance knowing it's poor quality.  However, he didn't let fans know that in this flick, you get to see his gluteus maximus twice.  You may have to use the slow-down button on your remote control, but it's definitely there.  When seeing Big Show wrestle, if you've ever said, ""I wonder what he looks like naked?"", then this film will give you some idea of that.  If you love you some big men, then you should see this flick despite its obvious shortcomings.Derriere aside, yes, this is predictable and silly, as anyone could assume.  The characters crash a bus in a field and they just walk away from it.  No farmer ever takes them to task for destroying his land.  The explosion never sets the whole field on fire.  A boy doesn't know a fire is going on while playing a video game.  Yes, young people can be focused, but a person at any age would say, ""Why do I smell smoke?!""  Big Show's character is supposed to be unsophisticated, yet when the subject of family jewels comes up, he is all of a sudden able to make double entrendres and witty repartee.  Of course, there's a predictable love story line here too.

This is not a bunch of idiots daring each other to do stupid things, it's a family movie. Paul Wight plays Walter, a 7 foot tall orphan who has never left the orphanage, also a gentle giant who wouldn't hurt a fly. The orphanages kitchen burns down, and in order to save the orphanage, they have to raise money in a week to replace the kitchen. So a trainer discovers Walter, and takes him on a road trip to train him to be a fighter and attempt to win a martial arts contest to get the money.Sure, the plot sounds pretty thin, but as does most light-hearted family comedies of this type. You will see the typical love interest, fart gags and corny jokes that go into the making of these kinds of films. It's a decent movie, better then you might expect, but just do not expect it to be a Steve Austin action movie or a Glen Jacobs (Kane) horror movie it is far from either. Take note when you see the PG-13 rating, and not M or R, so do not expect ""JACKASS"" to appear and start clubbing each other in the nads to win over some mindless teenagers idea of what funny is.
