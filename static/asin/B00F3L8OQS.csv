1670313,A3D0T6EHDQREDJ,B00F3L8OQS,Cartoon lover,"[1, 1]",I like it . I love having the rest of season 1 on dvd now. However it appears that Millcreek decided to edit out the bumpers that would occur before and after commercials. And they did not do a perfect job so you actually do get a frame or two of a bumper every now and then if you press pause. Also you can get one single bumper that they left in....HEY MILLCREEK WE WANT THE BUMPERS LEAVE THEM IN! Ok so you can go to youtube and hopefully find some im sure. For now GOOD JOB for keeping your promise Millcreek and putting this out. Can we squeeze season 2 out of you?,4,It's the rest of season 1 yay.

I think that they released something that others might not have taken a chance on.  i also appreciate their releasing it in a timely manner.That being said, I must say that the packaging for this Heathcliff release will unfortunately be poorly received.People will feel the discs will get scratched if they are put one on top of each other with this design.I think people find the packaging to be OK that was used with the previous Heathcliff release.I hope it will be beneficial for Mill Creek to release the rest of the series.",3,packaging could improve.  appreciate the release.,1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,583,"['i', 'am', 'appreciative', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'released', 'set', 'think', 'released', 'something', 'others', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'taken', 'chance', 'i', 'also', 'appreciate', 'releasing', 'timely', 'manner.That', 'being', 'said', 'must', 'say', 'packaging', 'Heathcliff', 'release', 'will', 'unfortunately', 'be', 'poorly', 'received.People', 'will', 'feel', 'discs', 'will', 'get', 'scratched', 'are', 'put', 'one', 'top', 'other', 'design.I', 'think', 'people', 'find', 'packaging', 'be', 'OK', 'was', 'used', 'previous', 'Heathcliff', 'release.I', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'beneficial', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'release', 'rest', 'series']","Heathcliff - Season 1, Volume 2 - 33 Episodes"
