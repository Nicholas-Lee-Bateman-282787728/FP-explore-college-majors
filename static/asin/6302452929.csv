313198,A3KSW2CDMNMN34,6302452929,Mr. James A. Newton,"[5, 6]","This is a fairly good film; I just happen to think the title is misleading. Sure it tells the partial story of a man who became the 'last of his tribe', but it concentrates on the also very interesting story of the men who knew him best in the last years of his life. I'm not sure if this film really knew where it was going, whose story it was, or why it should be told. I sort of feel this is two films cobbled together ...... but not very well.Ishi was apparently the last member of the Yahi tribe who 'appeared' out of the Northern California countryside in the early years of the 20th Century. He was then taken in by Alfred Kroeber, a professor of Anthropology for the final 5 years of his life. the film covers this period and while accurate does not really delve too deeply into the character of Ishi, but focusses on Kroeber and how this period was difficult in his life.As I've already said this is quite a good film, but I think the title should reference Kroeber so watchers are not mislead. The story as to 'how' Ishi became the 'last of his tribe' really deserves a separate film in itself. in the meantime for more on this very intricate and human story I'd suggest reading ""Ishi Rediscovered""; ""Ishi's Brain""; ""Ishi the Last Yahi"" and ""Ishi in Two Worlds"".

The historical significance alone makes it worth seeing.Beyond that, Graham Greene and Jon Voight give outstanding and moving performances. Greene (who is always excellent - Clearcut, Thunderheart, Dances With Wolves, etc.) as Ishi, and Voight as the genius anthropologist who takes him in.Voight's character is a pure scientist through and through who finds it difficult to get emotionally involved with much of anything.
