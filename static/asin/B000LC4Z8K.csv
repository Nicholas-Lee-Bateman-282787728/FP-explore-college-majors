1038566,A3QVJHA6LLAN6M,B000LC4Z8K,,"[0, 0]","I'm a fan of the series. I have all four seasons, and with the series' cliffhanger conclusion, I knew it was only a matter of time before I got my hands on this DVD. All things considered, if you didn't like how the series ended, you will only find both movies hard to watch.I can mostly forgive &#34;the Pretender 2001&#34;, especially since it really worked to be true in spirit and in story to the series. We finally see how Jarod escaped the Centre (although that doesn't seem like that much of a challenge), and he pulls off a heartfelt pretend to work a case involving a fellow lab rat. The geek in me can even appreciate the Joker/Batman allusion to the villain's origin story.What doesn't sit well is the use of Ethan, and the perpetuation of this mystic power he shares with Miss Parker of seeing ghosts. While just about everything in the Pretender series is hand-waved by Jarod's genius and a Hollywood justice system, there's some things that are just too fantastical when introduced into a semi real-world setting. This is definitely one of them.And that's where &#34;the Pretender - Island of the Haunted&#34; screws everything up. This particular one is more about the Parkers than Jarod, although his mother makes a brief appearance. I could tell you not to get your hopes up, but if you're going to watch it, that'll happen no matter what. Apparently there's a collection of ancient scrolls that hold no real value, but is sought after due to what might be written on them. There's some refreshing exchanges between Jarod and Miss Parker when the two are stranded on an island together, and we get some resurfacing feelings of respect and affection for one another that began in a great episode of the first season under similar circumstances. But when that is pushed to the background, and the truly stupid story takes over - one gets bored fast.There is no resolution to the series. There are some revelations that make little sense in any context, but by the time it all goes down you've either already guessed that's the direction they'd take, or you're just not surprised anymore.The cast isn't at their best, and that's mostly because of how important or unimportant their characters are to both stories. The loveable butt-monkey Broots really doesn't do anything beyond looking at encrypted files on a computer, and even worse, Sydney is only really there to look over his shoulder in a completely useless manner. Mr Lyle's best moment is a half-assed distraction with the Triumvirate, but he's lost all creepiness and charm as he's situated in the background. Even creepy Raines offers little, even with some potentially frightening revelations about his past - this guy is just used up.I love Miss Parker, and my own personal bias is reacting to the way her character is just turned into some freakshow - a fate worse than death. I'd have preferred her character to have died protecting Jarod, or even died in some Mexican standoff with Jarod and say, Mr Lyle... but alas, she's still a slave to the Centre when the last movie ends.Do yourself a favor and let this one go.",2,Lazy and Haphazard,1375660800,"08 5, 2013",2013,3098,"[""'m"", 'fan', 'series', 'have', 'four', 'seasons', 'series', 'cliffhanger', 'conclusion', 'knew', 'was', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'got', 'hands', 'DVD', 'things', 'considered', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'series', 'ended', 'will', 'only', 'find', 'movies', 'hard', 'watch.I', 'can', 'mostly', 'forgive', '34', 'Pretender', '2001', '34', 'especially', 'really', 'worked', 'be', 'true', 'spirit', 'story', 'series', 'finally', 'see', 'how', 'Jarod', 'escaped', 'Centre', ""n't"", 'seem', 'much', 'challenge', 'heartfelt', 'pretend', 'work', 'case', 'involving', 'fellow', 'lab', 'rat', 'geek', 'can', 'even', 'appreciate', 'Joker/Batman', 'allusion', 'villain', 'origin', 'story.What', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'use', 'Ethan', 'perpetuation', 'mystic', 'power', 'shares', 'Miss', 'Parker', 'seeing', 'ghosts', 'just', 'everything', 'Pretender', 'series', 'hand-waved', 'Jarod', 'genius', 'Hollywood', 'justice', 'system', 'things', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'fantastical', 'when', 'introduced', 'semi', 'real-world', 'setting', 'definitely', 'one', 'them.And', 'where', '34', 'Pretender', 'Island', 'Haunted', '34', 'screws', 'everything', 'up', 'particular', 'one', 'more', 'Parkers', 'Jarod', 'mother', 'brief', 'appearance', 'could', 'tell', 'not', 'get', 'hopes', 'up', ""'re"", 'going', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'happen', 'matter', 'what', 'Apparently', 'collection', 'ancient', 'scrolls', 'hold', 'real', 'value', 'sought', 'due', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'written', 'refreshing', 'exchanges', 'Jarod', 'Miss', 'Parker', 'when', 'two', 'are', 'stranded', 'island', 'together', 'get', 'resurfacing', 'feelings', 'respect', 'affection', 'one', 'began', 'great', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'similar', 'circumstances', 'when', 'pushed', 'background', 'truly', 'stupid', 'story', 'one', 'bored', 'resolution', 'series', 'are', 'revelations', 'make', 'little', 'sense', 'context', 'time', 'down', ""'ve"", 'already', 'guessed', 'direction', ""'d"", 'take', ""'re"", 'just', 'not', 'surprised', 'anymore.The', 'cast', ""n't"", 'best', 'mostly', 'how', 'important', 'unimportant', 'characters', 'are', 'stories', 'loveable', 'butt-monkey', 'Broots', 'really', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'looking', 'encrypted', 'files', 'computer', 'even', 'worse', 'Sydney', 'only', 'really', 'look', 'shoulder', 'completely', 'useless', 'manner', 'Mr', 'Lyle', 'best', 'moment', 'half-assed', 'distraction', 'Triumvirate', 'lost', 'creepiness', 'charm', 'situated', 'background', 'Even', 'creepy', 'Raines', 'little', 'even', 'potentially', 'frightening', 'revelations', 'past', 'guy', 'just', 'used', 'up.I', 'love', 'Miss', 'Parker', 'own', 'personal', 'bias', 'reacting', 'way', 'character', 'just', 'turned', 'freakshow', 'fate', 'worse', 'death', ""'d"", 'have', 'preferred', 'character', 'have', 'died', 'protecting', 'Jarod', 'even', 'died', 'Mexican', 'standoff', 'Jarod', 'say', 'Mr', 'Lyle', 'alas', 'still', 'slave', 'Centre', 'when', 'last', 'movie', 'ends.Do', 'favor', 'let', 'one', 'go']",N/A

So I was glad to be able to not only get the 4 series but also the two films on DVD too from Amazon in America.The two films aren't extentions of the series in that Jarod helps people whilst discovering pieces of his past by trying to find his family.  In the films they firmly centre of Jarod's search for his family and why The Centre wanted him so badly.  Alas we don't get to know as there is a tantalising cliffhanger at the end of Island of the Haunted.  I do hope at least another film is made in the future at some time to either wrap up the story arc or give us more pieces of the puzzle.I recommend the entire Pretender DVDs collection.  The first series has some really funny episodes, as Jarod newly escaped from The Centre has some quite childlike qualities (despite being a genius) as he discovered new things that we take for granted.We don't get Twinkies or Crackerjacks in this country, so when I went to America a couple of years back because of The Pretender (who tries both in different episodes) I had to try both products.

'The Pretender 2001' answers a few questions of where season 4 left off but leads to even more unanswered questions.  It was a very entertaining film, much in the same vein as its episodic predecessors, so it is definitely worth watching for any 'Pretender' fan.'The Pretender - The Island of the Haunted' is even more puzzling and complex than the preceding film, which is frustrating to no end since there is no real resolve.  What began as an enigmatic series headed by the altruistic protagonist and the ambiguous hunters, namely Ms. Parker, Broots and Sidney, ends up in much the same way, with simply a few more pieces of the puzzles but far from having a complete picture of Jarod and Ms. Parker's legacies.  The movie itself is well directed with an eerie yet appealing ambience on the island that's riddled with mysteries, and the story is clever, as usual.  Nothing is left desired acting wise, the cast delivers great performances, especially by Jarod and Ms. Parker, who hint at something beyond mere mutual respect and an unspoken comradery.All in all, this is well worth getting as it is a slightly better conclusion to the series than the season 4 finale cliffhanger, but nevertheless, I along with all the other fans of 'The Pretender' want answers to the questions that remain from the numerous arching storylines, such as who exactly is Jarod's mother, will he ever get to spend time with her and settle down, what became of Jarod's dad, who murdered Ms. Parker's mother and why, what is the fate of Ms. Parker's newly found half brother, besides Mr. Lyle, what will happen with Mr. Parker and Brigitte's newborn son from season 4, what will happen to the Triumvirate, The Centre, as well as the new questions from both these new, final films.I implore the producers of this excellent series to please make an ultimate film that will once and for all answer the burning questions that have haunted not just Jarod and Ms. Parker but the fans as well for so many years.  I sincerely plead to both the TNT and NBC channels that they produce a fitting end to 'The Pretender' saga.

Between the good ratings and fan pleas, the cable net decided to make these two television movies. It was originally planned as four films, but TNT's lack of support in promoting the second led to bad ratings and therefore no further movies.""The Pretender 2001"" - Reunites the cast and creative from the series, in fact picking up where the cliffhanger of season four ends. Jarod (Michael T. Weiss) makes it a point to reveal even more disturbing facts about The Centre. At the center of everything, as always, Miss Parker (Andrea Parker) fends off her disfunctional family in her futile quest for truth. Of the two, this remained truest to the series' tone.""The Pretender: Island of the Haunted"" - While there were appearances by most of the original cast, this was a battle of wills between Jarod and Miss Parker. They find themselves trapped on a small island in Scotland where Jarod tracks down his long lost mother. From there, it seemed to go off in a quasi-supernatural direction which was completely foreign to the show. Since the same creative team was in place, it's hard to fault them for changing their creation. Probably with the hope that TNT would see series potential in the altered Pretender reality.Overall, ""2001"" puts a nice cap on the series. ""Haunted"" is a worthwhile diversion for fans. Michael T. Weiss and Andrea Parker worked very well together, and ""Haunted"" is one of the few times they got to work face-to-face for any length of time.",5,"One great, one very good.",1165449600,"12 7, 2006",2006,1525,"['NBC', 'cancelled', 'Pretender', 'reruns', 'showed', 'up', 'TNT', 'good', 'ratings', 'fan', 'pleas', 'cable', 'net', 'decided', 'make', 'two', 'television', 'movies', 'was', 'originally', 'planned', 'four', 'films', 'TNT', 'lack', 'support', 'promoting', 'second', 'led', 'bad', 'ratings', 'therefore', 'further', 'movies', 'Pretender', '2001', 'cast', 'creative', 'series', 'fact', 'picking', 'up', 'where', 'cliffhanger', 'season', 'four', 'ends', 'Jarod', 'Michael', 'T.', 'Weiss', 'point', 'reveal', 'even', 'more', 'disturbing', 'facts', 'Centre', 'center', 'everything', 'always', 'Miss', 'Parker', 'Andrea', 'Parker', 'disfunctional', 'family', 'futile', 'quest', 'truth', 'two', 'remained', 'truest', 'series', 'tone', 'Pretender', 'Island', 'Haunted', 'were', 'appearances', 'most', 'original', 'cast', 'was', 'battle', 'wills', 'Jarod', 'Miss', 'Parker', 'find', 'trapped', 'small', 'island', 'Scotland', 'where', 'Jarod', 'down', 'long', 'lost', 'mother', 'there', 'seemed', 'go', 'off', 'quasi-supernatural', 'direction', 'was', 'completely', 'foreign', 'show', 'same', 'creative', 'team', 'was', 'place', 'hard', 'fault', 'changing', 'creation', 'Probably', 'hope', 'TNT', 'would', 'see', 'series', 'potential', 'altered', 'Pretender', 'reality.Overall', '2001', 'nice', 'cap', 'series', 'Haunted', 'worthwhile', 'diversion', 'fans', 'Michael', 'T.', 'Weiss', 'Andrea', 'Parker', 'worked', 'very', 'well', 'together', 'Haunted', 'one', 'few', 'times', 'got', 'work', 'face-to-face', 'length', 'time']",N/A
