1313171,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B002ZG99QS,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[5, 13]","If nothing else, 'Tron Legacy' is Sci-Fi eye-candy.  Of course 'Tron Legacy' has some visual appeal that immediately hooks in the audience.  There are discuses which are thrown as weapons in stadium duels between man and machine, artificial crowd cheering, and vehicles that ride in Matrix-like slow-motion arcs that splash wild neon colors in high-tech chase scenes.There's a trade off that takes place between the original Tron and the sequel, 'Tron Legacy'.  And judging both entities is really a matter of separating the story from the special effects.  (Although taking a movie apart in not an entirely fair way to judge a movie.)Call me old-fashioned.  Call me clueless, but, while I love how the new visuals' striking appeal, and I really enjoyed how they linked time together by having Flynn's son visit his father's old arcade after he mysteriously disappeared from his Fortune 500 company (as well as rebooting the sequel by having Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner on the screen) the pregnant pauses for narrative and a too-often pensive story-line take away the excitement and urgency found in the primitive original.Further that with more stagnant and less compelling chase sequences in between, and I thought much of the magic was lost.  The fights in the inner space bar seem lame and familiar--especially if you consider the original 'Star Wars' as the standard.  Chris Pine or Channing Tatum could just have easily taken the part of Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund).  This young protagonist, along with a few others were far from a stellar cast, except for Bridges who could play his character with the vitality and looks easily reminiscent of his younger performance--alongside with his aging counterpart, a Zen recluse (a captive to his own technology) and his nemesis/alter ego (Clu).  Olivia Wilde as the heroine, Quorra, doesn't do much for the proceedings either.  Bruce Boxleitner is merely a token memory of the original.I truly remember the original 'Tron' back in the early eighties.  It transported me to a place I had never been before.  In college video games had invigorated our recreation time with ""Donkey Kong,"" ""Pac-Man,"" and ""Centipede,"" which gave us study breaks and a hefty escape from the pressures of college.  Tron delivered us into that same world in a sustaining way by combining a convincing mix of arcade life and real life.  The visuals and the world created there were both unique and mesmerizing.  By the time the protagonist was brought back to life outside the game, I felt I had been gone a long time.'Tron Legacy' remains worthy as a minor arcade, a nice milestone party, and a bit of memory filing experience--not unlike a thirty year high school reunion, but, in the end, the film is a forgettable ride that might be worth taking only once.",3,High-Tech 'Tron Legacy':  More Advanced/Less Worthwhile,1296518400,"02 1, 2011",2011,2790,"['nothing', 'else', 'Legacy', 'Sci-Fi', 'eye-candy', 'course', ""'Tron"", 'Legacy', 'visual', 'appeal', 'immediately', 'audience', 'are', 'discuses', 'are', 'thrown', 'weapons', 'stadium', 'duels', 'man', 'machine', 'artificial', 'crowd', 'cheering', 'vehicles', 'ride', 'Matrix-like', 'slow-motion', 'arcs', 'wild', 'neon', 'colors', 'high-tech', 'chase', 'trade', 'off', 'place', 'original', 'Tron', 'sequel', 'Legacy', 'judging', 'entities', 'really', 'matter', 'separating', 'story', 'special', 'effects', 'taking', 'movie', 'apart', 'not', 'entirely', 'fair', 'way', 'judge', 'movie', 'Call', 'old-fashioned', 'Call', 'clueless', 'love', 'how', 'new', 'visuals', 'striking', 'appeal', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'how', 'linked', 'time', 'together', 'having', 'Flynn', 'son', 'visit', 'father', 'old', 'arcade', 'mysteriously', 'disappeared', 'Fortune', '500', 'company', 'as', 'well', 'rebooting', 'sequel', 'having', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Bruce', 'Boxleitner', 'screen', 'pregnant', 'pauses', 'narrative', 'too-often', 'pensive', 'story-line', 'take', 'away', 'excitement', 'urgency', 'found', 'primitive', 'original.Further', 'more', 'stagnant', 'less', 'compelling', 'chase', 'sequences', 'thought', 'much', 'magic', 'was', 'lost', 'fights', 'inner', 'space', 'bar', 'seem', 'lame', 'familiar', 'especially', 'consider', 'original', ""'Star"", 'Wars', 'standard', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'could', 'just', 'have', 'easily', 'taken', 'part', 'Sam', 'Flynn', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'young', 'protagonist', 'few', 'others', 'were', 'far', 'stellar', 'cast', 'Bridges', 'who', 'could', 'play', 'character', 'vitality', 'easily', 'reminiscent', 'younger', 'performance', 'aging', 'counterpart', 'Zen', 'recluse', 'captive', 'own', 'technology', 'nemesis/alter', 'ego', 'Clu', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'heroine', 'Quorra', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'proceedings', 'Bruce', 'Boxleitner', 'merely', 'token', 'memory', 'original.I', 'truly', 'remember', 'original', ""'Tron"", 'back', 'early', 'eighties', 'transported', 'place', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'before', 'college', 'video', 'games', 'had', 'invigorated', 'recreation', 'time', 'Donkey', 'Kong', 'Pac-Man', 'Centipede', 'gave', 'study', 'breaks', 'hefty', 'escape', 'pressures', 'college', 'Tron', 'delivered', 'same', 'world', 'sustaining', 'way', 'combining', 'convincing', 'mix', 'arcade', 'life', 'real', 'life', 'visuals', 'world', 'created', 'were', 'unique', 'mesmerizing', 'time', 'protagonist', 'was', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'game', 'felt', 'had', 'been', 'gone', 'long', 'time', 'Legacy', 'worthy', 'minor', 'arcade', 'nice', 'milestone', 'party', 'bit', 'memory', 'filing', 'experience', 'not', 'thirty', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'reunion', 'end', 'film', 'forgettable', 'ride', 'might', 'be', 'worth', 'taking', 'only', 'once']",N/A

1313176,A9VSDB7HJFMAO,B002ZG99QS,AJ Hayden,"[0, 0]","I'll be honest, I wasn't a huge friend of the original ""Tron"" and had no interest in watching it. But eventually, we rented it and I decided to rent it. I liked it better than the original ""Tron"", but it wasn't the best movie ever.The graphics were amazing. The way they were able to create the whole video-game world was cool. Nothing looked cheap or lame. I thought it was also interesting, that with Jeff Bridges, they were able to make him look younger (not just with hair color, but also removing wrinkles and stuff like that.) Hands down, the graphics are five stars.But everything else? I can only give it an ""okay"" unfortunately.THE PLOT: At least there WAS a plot. In the original ""Tron,"" I couldn't see a plot (but at the same time I wasn't really paying attention.) It was pretty basic and somewhat unoriginal (bad ruler, must destroy bad ruler), but easy to follow.THE ACTING: Garett Hetlund can somewhat act. I can sort of see some acting skils poking through, but a lot of the time, he sort of came off as a pubescent boy who's saying, ""Look how cool I am. Do you see my awesome talent?""I liked Olivia Wild's acting overall and I liked Quorra's character. She was tough, but not one of those ""kick-butt-without-a-heart"" female characters. My only real complaint for her is that the wig looked sort of funny on her. It didn't come off obvious that she had one, but she looks better with brown hair. Maybe it looked funny because her eyebrows weren't the same color as her hair.Between Sam and Quorra, I appreciated that there was barely any romance. I like just a little bit of romance sprinkled in a film (or book), but this didn't have any. It also didn't have one of those start-out-fighting-end-up-in-love relationships (which is starting to get very overused.)Jeff Bridges played a good Clu/Kevin Flynn.The Sirens (for the short time that they're in it) were awesome. Whoever did their makeup deserves a round of applause, all silvery and pale and almost frightening.LOVED Zuse/Castor. He was hilarious and absolutely entertaining to watch.Overall, this film is good, but definitely not worth buying.

However, there was something about its sequel that made me want to see it (and, no, it wasn't Olivia Wilde -- although that didn't hurt). The story picks up about 21 years after Sam's (Garrett Hedlund) dad, Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) disappears. Now the grown-up Sam finds a clue that may lead to his dad. That's when he enters the Grid, where he's soon accompanied by a program, Quorra (Wilde). LikeTangled, I saw this film in 3-D. It was cool to see even though it doesn't usually make a difference to me (plus, seeing Wilde in 3-D wasn't so bad). I have to admit that I've never seen the attraction that most people have to Olivia Wilde, but this movie did work very much in her favor. She is extremely attractive and I liked the fact that her character wasn't some vampy sex kitten-type. Bridges shines as Flynn, who is almost like an offspring of the Dude fromThe Big Lebowski (Widescreen Collector's Edition). He plays the part well and is able to prove his coolness and great acting ability all in this performance. My only gripe is that the computer-generated de-aging of Bridges as Clu seems a bit clunky during the movie, but, then again, Clu being only a computer program, maybe it's meant to look that way. ""Tron: Legacy"" may not appeal to everyone as it's very technical (I didn't know every technical aspect that was mentioned), but it's great entertainment.",4,You don't have to be a fan of the original to love this!,1305331200,"05 14, 2011",2011,1479,"['was', 'never', 'big', 'fan', 'originalTron', 'Original', 'Classic', 'Special', 'Edition', 'acquired', 'taste', 'However', 'was', 'something', 'sequel', 'made', 'want', 'see', 'was', ""n't"", 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'story', 'up', '21', 'years', 'Sam', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'dad', 'Kevin', 'Flynn', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Now', 'grown-up', 'Sam', 'clue', 'may', 'lead', 'dad', 'when', 'Grid', 'where', 'soon', 'accompanied', 'program', 'Quorra', 'Wilde', 'LikeTangled', 'saw', 'film', '3-D', 'was', 'cool', 'see', 'even', ""n't"", 'usually', 'make', 'difference', 'seeing', 'Wilde', '3-D', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'have', 'admit', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'attraction', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'movie', 'did', 'work', 'very', 'much', 'favor', 'extremely', 'attractive', 'liked', 'fact', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'vampy', 'sex', 'kitten-type', 'Bridges', 'shines', 'Flynn', 'who', 'almost', 'offspring', 'Dude', 'fromThe', 'Big', 'Lebowski', 'Widescreen', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'part', 'well', 'able', 'prove', 'coolness', 'great', 'acting', 'ability', 'performance', 'only', 'gripe', 'computer-generated', 'de-aging', 'Bridges', 'Clu', 'bit', 'clunky', 'movie', 'then', 'again', 'Clu', 'being', 'only', 'computer', 'program', 'meant', 'look', 'way', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'may', 'not', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'very', 'technical', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'technical', 'aspect', 'was', 'mentioned', 'great', 'entertainment']",N/A
1313188,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002ZG99QS,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I have not seen the original `Tron' film.  Maybe that was a bad way to walk into this film, and then again maybe it was the best way.  My eyes were not blinded by the blindfold of nostalgia and I was able to judge the film based on its own merits and not those created by its predecessor.  And then again, some will balk that movies within a series need to be seen and judged within that series because some if not most is lost on eyes not familiar with the origins of the film.I don't see `Tron' as being in that boat since I could follow this film rather easily and so I don't think anything at all was lost of these virgin eyes.`Tron: Legacy' tells the story of a young man named Sam who is haunted by the disappearance of his father.  His father, Kevin Flynn, was a computer genius who created a cyber-universe of sorts and then suddenly vanished after leaving the lingering promise to take his son to that world.  His son, now all grown up, is a rebel of sorts; a young man swimming in the wealth his father left behind who has no desire to run his father's company but takes it upon himself to sabotage their efforts if he sees them conflicting with what he perceives would have been his father's wishes.  After a mysterious `page' comes through from his father's old office, Sam ventures into the unknown as he is sucked into the world behind the screen, the world his father created but that has now become trapped in the chaos surrounding the enthronement of Kevin's own creation; Clu.  Clu is the evil doppelganger of Kevin Flynn, a dangerous force determined to travel into the real world.  The only way that he can do that is to enter the portal using a special disc resting on Kevin's back.  Kevin has thus been in hiding, dwelling in the outskirts of The Grid with a young woman, a miracle of sorts, who has proved to be his guardian angel.  Sam now has to help his father defeat Clu before the rest of the world suffers at his tyranny.To say that this film is hollow would be an understatement.  There really isn't any depth at play here.  That doesn't mean that the film isn't fun, because it excels in that department.  In fact, the film is a visual feast and I must admit to being blindsided by that.  When I initially saw the trailer for the film I was unimpressed.  The dark color palate just seemed so monotonous and I was expecting to be bored by the film's framing, but what I found was rather stellar.  The scenes are expertly framed.  The cinematography is exciting and bold and the blacks and bright lights complement each other flawlessly.The acting is decent.  Olivia Wilde has never looked better (and I mirror the sentiments that that shot of her lounging on the couch is THE still of the year) but she doesn't do much.  Bridges phones it in, Sheen oversells it (but he's fun) and Hedlund just looks happy to be there (but he has talent, it's just not on display here).  The script is lazy and formulaic (and there are some plot points that are never thought through fully, especially concerning Tron himself) and really is nothing but an excuse for digital violence, but that is the best part of the film and the real reason to watch.Your eyes will be happy you invited them to this party.",3,Visually dense...,1318809600,"10 17, 2011",2011,3220,"['have', 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'Tron', 'film', 'Maybe', 'was', 'bad', 'way', 'walk', 'film', 'then', 'again', 'maybe', 'was', 'best', 'way', 'eyes', 'were', 'not', 'blinded', 'blindfold', 'nostalgia', 'was', 'able', 'judge', 'film', 'based', 'own', 'merits', 'not', 'created', 'predecessor', 'then', 'again', 'will', 'balk', 'movies', 'series', 'need', 'be', 'seen', 'judged', 'series', 'not', 'most', 'lost', 'eyes', 'not', 'familiar', 'origins', 'film.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Tron', 'being', 'boat', 'could', 'follow', 'film', 'rather', 'easily', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'was', 'lost', 'virgin', 'eyes.', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Sam', 'who', 'haunted', 'disappearance', 'father', 'father', 'Kevin', 'Flynn', 'was', 'computer', 'genius', 'who', 'created', 'cyber-universe', 'sorts', 'then', 'suddenly', 'vanished', 'leaving', 'lingering', 'promise', 'take', 'son', 'world', 'son', 'now', 'grown', 'up', 'rebel', 'sorts', 'young', 'man', 'swimming', 'wealth', 'father', 'left', 'behind', 'who', 'desire', 'run', 'father', 'company', 'sabotage', 'efforts', 'conflicting', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'father', 'wishes', 'mysterious', 'page', 'father', 'old', 'office', 'Sam', 'ventures', 'unknown', 'sucked', 'world', 'screen', 'world', 'father', 'created', 'now', 'become', 'trapped', 'chaos', 'surrounding', 'enthronement', 'Kevin', 'own', 'creation', 'Clu', 'Clu', 'evil', 'doppelganger', 'Kevin', 'Flynn', 'dangerous', 'force', 'determined', 'travel', 'real', 'world', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'do', 'enter', 'portal', 'using', 'special', 'disc', 'resting', 'Kevin', 'back', 'Kevin', 'thus', 'been', 'hiding', 'dwelling', 'outskirts', 'Grid', 'young', 'woman', 'miracle', 'sorts', 'who', 'proved', 'be', 'guardian', 'angel', 'Sam', 'now', 'help', 'father', 'defeat', 'Clu', 'rest', 'world', 'suffers', 'tyranny.To', 'say', 'film', 'hollow', 'would', 'be', 'understatement', 'really', ""n't"", 'depth', 'play', 'here', ""n't"", 'mean', 'film', ""n't"", 'fun', 'department', 'fact', 'film', 'visual', 'feast', 'must', 'admit', 'being', 'blindsided', 'When', 'initially', 'saw', 'trailer', 'film', 'was', 'unimpressed', 'dark', 'color', 'palate', 'just', 'seemed', 'so', 'monotonous', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'bored', 'film', 'framing', 'what', 'found', 'was', 'rather', 'stellar', 'scenes', 'are', 'expertly', 'framed', 'cinematography', 'exciting', 'bold', 'blacks', 'bright', 'lights', 'complement', 'other', 'flawlessly.The', 'acting', 'decent', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'never', 'looked', 'better', 'mirror', 'sentiments', 'shot', 'lounging', 'couch', 'THE', 'still', 'year', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'Bridges', 'Sheen', 'fun', 'Hedlund', 'just', 'happy', 'be', 'there', 'talent', 'just', 'not', 'display', 'here', 'script', 'lazy', 'formulaic', 'are', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'never', 'thought', 'fully', 'especially', 'concerning', 'Tron', 'really', 'nothing', 'excuse', 'digital', 'violence', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'real', 'reason', 'watch.Your', 'eyes', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'invited', 'party']",N/A

As anticipated, this movie translates well to Blu-ray, although it looks very nice on DVD as well, in my opinion.

1313191,A32T2H8150OJLU,B002ZG99QS,ARH,"[2, 6]","First of all, you need to know that I very much enjoyedTron (20th Anniversary Collector's Edition)when it came out back in 1982 - I think I saw it three times in two days when I first saw it (this was in the days before everyone had video players), and I have seen it several times since.  I was mesmerized with TRON (1982) and the fact tht it was the first feature length film to rely entirely on digital effects.  I guess you could say that I'm a TRON fan.  What this means is that I had very high expectations when I went to see TRON:Legacy in the theater.For overall chic, coolness, and sci-fi fun, I put this film on par with STAR TREK (2009).  Plus, it's rated PG - totally watchable!What I can tell you without revealing anything about the storyline is that watching the movie was more of an overall experience for the senses than just an action movie.  There were fantastic effects, but the effects did not overwhelm or drive the story, and the techno-music from Daft Punk was a perfect match to the digital world of the web.  TRON: Legacy wasn't at all like the somewhat unsatisfying experience I had with Star Wars III - which was a major dose of digital candy with little else to offer.Anyway, TRON: Legacy had an interesting premis stemming from TRON (1982), had many interesting connections to that older film if you know what to look for, e.g., Dumont's garage, ""That is a big door"", etc.  Jeff Bridges was fantastic, the special effects were gripping, the action was engaging, and the acting was quite good.  I think that this film was better or at least on par with other good recent films I've seen, e.g., Avatar, Sherlock Holmes, etc.  It's not a non-stop adrenaline rush, but it's a good mix of action, thoughtfulness, great effects, and memorable characters.This is definitely a 5-star show for sci-fi fans, and a 4-star offering for action adventure fans.  Since I like sci-fi, I give it a strong 5-star rating.",5,"Went in with high expectations, and was NOT disappointed",1292630400,"12 18, 2010",2010,1932,"['First', 'all', 'need', 'know', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyedTron', '20th', 'Anniversary', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'back', '1982', 'think', 'saw', 'three', 'times', 'two', 'days', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'was', 'days', 'everyone', 'had', 'video', 'players', 'have', 'seen', 'several', 'times', 'was', 'mesmerized', 'TRON', '1982', 'fact', 'was', 'first', 'feature', 'length', 'film', 'rely', 'entirely', 'digital', 'effects', 'guess', 'could', 'say', ""'m"", 'TRON', 'fan', 'What', 'had', 'very', 'high', 'expectations', 'when', 'went', 'see', 'TRON', 'Legacy', 'theater.For', 'overall', 'chic', 'coolness', 'sci-fi', 'fun', 'put', 'film', 'par', 'STAR', 'TREK', '2009', 'rated', 'PG', 'totally', 'watchable', 'What', 'can', 'tell', 'revealing', 'anything', 'storyline', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'overall', 'experience', 'senses', 'just', 'action', 'movie', 'were', 'fantastic', 'effects', 'effects', 'did', 'not', 'overwhelm', 'drive', 'story', 'techno-music', 'Daft', 'Punk', 'was', 'perfect', 'match', 'digital', 'world', 'web', 'TRON', 'Legacy', 'was', ""n't"", 'somewhat', 'unsatisfying', 'experience', 'had', 'Star', 'Wars', 'III', 'was', 'major', 'dose', 'digital', 'candy', 'little', 'else', 'offer.Anyway', 'TRON', 'Legacy', 'had', 'interesting', 'premis', 'stemming', 'TRON', '1982', 'had', 'many', 'interesting', 'connections', 'older', 'film', 'know', 'what', 'look', 'e.g.', 'Dumont', 'garage', 'big', 'door', 'etc', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'was', 'fantastic', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'gripping', 'action', 'was', 'engaging', 'acting', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'think', 'film', 'was', 'better', 'least', 'par', 'other', 'good', 'recent', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'e.g.', 'Avatar', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'etc', 'not', 'non-stop', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'good', 'mix', 'action', 'thoughtfulness', 'great', 'effects', 'memorable', 'characters.This', 'definitely', '5-star', 'show', 'sci-fi', 'fans', '4-star', 'offering', 'action', 'adventure', 'fans', 'sci-fi', 'give', 'strong', '5-star', 'rating']",N/A

But I have to say visually, nothing can top it- it's simply beautiful. The light cycle scene has simply made history all over again and that's saying it lightly. The disc battle was much more impressive than the first movie for sure ! The music was amazing considering Daft punk did the soundtrack. But where I find it interesting is right after the Light Cycle scene there is this HUGE drop off in action? The movie takes a hard left turn for the worst. Continuously trying to explain the first film all over again which I found completely unnecessary to say the least. So be prepared for a lot of talking and a lot of flash backs for no reason? I personally think this was a cheap way out to save money to be honest. Because if they had of put more action sequences in the film like the 1st one. This would have easily topped Avatar in the budget department. I certainly hope the next one has a better script and TRON returns as a main character. But over all I was visually pleased and I felt they did a excellent job in upgrading the characters, environment and light cycles.

1313194,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B002ZG99QS,Armando N. Roman,"[6, 9]","I was never that excited about Tron: Legacy, having not seen the original movie, but the visual style got me interested. Well, that and Olivia Wilde looking damn good in all the ads I'd seen. But watching Tron: Evolution was a complete chore, despite me being wide awake and not having any distractions. This movie was cold, had all the action in the first half of the movie, had one whole character with personality, and relied way too much on the incredible special effects. Just think about the Star Wars prequels, only nowhere near as bad, and that's what Tron: Legacy is. I think this movie will only appeal to hardcore fans of the original, who've been waiting so long for the sequel, or people who will like anything sci-fi because they don't know any better.The movie starts out with Sam Flynn, son of Kevin Flynn, the original Tron's main character. Kevin built a computer program that was essentially its own world, but disappeared one day, never to be seen again. After causing a little bit of over-dramatic havoc with the company his dad ran, Sam goes into Kevin's old arcade, and stumbles upon an old computer, and enters the program. The world looks like a high-tech night club, complete with a rockin' soundtrack to go along with it, but it's not all fun. Immediately, Sam is thrown into dangerous games, where you can be 'derezzed' (the program's equivalent of death), whether you're a real person or AI. After he gets saved by the lovely Quorra, Sam meets his dad for the first time in years, where everything's revealed about the world, and how they can get out into the real world again.If the plot summary sounds good to you, well, then by all means rent the movie. But there are too many problems that keep it from being the hit that it wanted to be. First up, the characters are dull. Aside from Kevin Flynn, I didn't care for any of these characters. Well, aside from Quorra of course, but that's just because she was so dang pretty. Sam is plain, all the bad guys are as generic as you can be and not threatening, emoting mostly with scowls, and yelling here and there, and it's hard to connect with them. Granted, there were some good father-son moments, but that was all thanks to Jeff Bridges' acting, where it always came off as sincere. I liked the touch of having Kevin use some outdated slang words from the 80s, but I couldn't help thinking that I was seeing The Dude instead of Kevin Flynn in some parts. The other huge problem is that all the action is thrown into the first half of the movie: a big chase, light cycle races, disc fights, etc. These were all really cool scenes, and not getting anything even equal to those scenes for the climax was a huge letdown. Almost as bad is the lack of humor that isn't coming out of Jeff Bridges' mouth. I wasn't expecting a comedy, but for god's sake, this movie could almost pass off as a sci-fi drama instead of a sci-fi action movie. Before and after the light cycle and disc fight scenes, I was literally falling asleep thanks to the poor pacing. As incredible as the visuals and art direction were, which is the reason I'm still thinking about this movie 2 months after watching it, I don't know if I'll ever buy it and watch it much because of how boring it was. This is one of those movies I'd have just to skip to my favorite scenes, then throw back on the shelf for x months.As for the blu-ray itself, it's absolutely perfect. Flawless picture and audio. If there's any one movie out there to show off your new tv and sound system with, it's definitely this one. And if you have a 3D tv, go with the 3D version of the movie, because it's one of the few 3D blu-rays that really uses the technology as it was meant to be. I have zero complaints in these categories. The special features are loaded as well, but the main thing you'll want to watch is the Flynn Lives material. It covers the marketing campaign that got all the hardcore fans hyped.Like I just mentioned, I'm still thinking about this movie 2 months later, but it's all because of the visuals and soundtrack...and Olivia Wilde. There's nothing special about Tron: Legacy as far as the story or characters go, and it has a couple of scenes that are downright embarrassing to watch (Michael Sheen's odd dance bit comes to mind immediately).

I've seen clips and I do not find it visually appealing. I understand the gist of the plot and the character's involved and know enough to understand the references in Tron: Legacy. That being said, I loved Tron: Legacy so much that I've seen it twice.2D vs 3D. I must say that I despise this 3D trend because the movies I have seen in 3D did not feel like it added anything spectacular to it. When I think of 3D, I think of objects flying out of the screen and feeling like I could reach out my hand and touch them. With Tron: Legacy, there was so much potential here. A disc flying out, programs disintegrating in front of you..etc etc. There were moments where it felt like my eyes were crossed, more than anything. I don't doubt that certain scenes like the lightcycle grid and disc wars, the 3D really enhanced them, but I'm not sure it was worth the extra four bucks. The second time, I saw it in regular 2D and walked away feeling like the special effects were just as amazing. Now there were a couple of parts in 2D where things looked almost fake and you can tell that they were supposed to be 3D but not so much that it bothers you. The best part about the 3D experience was the trailers you saw before the movie, especially the intro for the Real 3D.There were a couple of things that annoyed me. For one, Kevin Flynn's overuse of 'man', 'radical', etc etc. The number of Star Wars references was another thing. The great purge of the ISOs...sounds like order 66 ie, the great jedi purge. During the dogfight scene, I expected Kevin to tell Sam not to get cocky. Perhaps I only see them that way because Star Wars is my geekdom, but obviously I was able to make connections.I do wish there had been greater detail about how Kevin created this new grid and how he was able to manifest a living space in the outlands. But that's not something that makes the movie bad for me. It just makes me thirst for more of the universe.I feel like there are very subtly placed possibilities for a continuation of the franchise and I have mixed feelings about that. It would be nice for a film to actually have an final ending, but at the same time, I feel like there is a lot of room to flesh this out and maybe answer those questions that others have asked.As far as acting goes, I think Garrett Hedlund did a good job in his role.

I can't begin to express how pretty the movie is.That said, this movie was very close to being very bad in a lot of ways.  It does appear that Disney spent their money on the visuals and the really good writers were too busy working onTangled (Four-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy)because there were elements of the storyline that were either lacking, cheesy, or just superficial.  The whole club scene with an overacting club owner inside the machine was just not believable and the acting was just plain bad.  At the same time, the whole yin/yang, nouvou hippy, my-zen mindset that Jeff Bridges had through the movie also just didn't come across as very real. But hey, that's just me.  The biggest issue I had though was that the movie is called TRON (trace program) and is supposed to be a super program that flynn developed to break into and out of anything --- well TRON is a very minor character and he doesn't speak (kindof like the STIG from Top Gear)....really?  I kindof expected TRON to do more.  Don't get me wrong, TRON is still out there and that's good but I just expected TRON to feature more prominently: he is the name of the movie.All of the shortfalls that I saw were made up by  a few things:- the gorgeous sets- the mere fact that a remake was made- the novelty of the conceptI will warn the average person that this movie might not be for you.  It is most certainly fanciful science fiction.  It gets a  lot of stars from those of us who love it but that most definitely does not mean that YOU are going to like it.For the die hards, I really don't have much to add, everything is here from the original, lightcycles, disc throwing, etc.Overall, it's not perfect (mostly because of some of the writing and some cheesy scenes) but it comes a long way from the original.Oh, yes get the bluray and watch it at night with the sound system turned up - you will not be disappointed.

The music and sound of the film is deep, powerful, and incredible. Daft Punk created an incredible score for this film, worthy of checking out on its own. I'm absolutely amazed at how this digital world was imagined and created. Director Joseph Kosinski, with his education and background in architecture, was clearly the brilliant Architect of the Tron: Legacy world in his directorial debut. I can't believe Kosinski was trusted with this massive film in his first outing as a director. There are scenes that are simply EPIC and will live on forever in cinematic history. I had goosebumps and chills at times in anticipation from the visuals and music. But as an overall film, Tron: Legacy didn't quite live up to my high expectations from watching the trailers over the last year. It's a good film...very much worthy of seeing on the big screen for its spectacle and digital wonderland. But beyond its eye- and aural-candy, the movie felt a bit empty. It tried so hard to have the soul of a great film. But like the lesson it tries to teach through its story, it's imperfection that is perfect...not perfection. Perfection is actually imperfect. And Tron: Legacy tries to be a little too perfect.I give Tron:Legacy 3.5 stars out of 5. It's definitely entertaining in many ways, as I mentioned above. The marketing for the film worked for me, because I've been anticipating this film for over a year and I just had to see it in the theater opening day...even though I was never a fan of the original film. I think the biggest flaws in the movie are the writing, acting, and directing. Neither fulfill on the promise that seemed possible in the trailers for this sequel to the original Tron (1982). Jeff Bridges and Garrett Hedlund, as father and son, do their best to bring life to the story and the relationship between them. But it's all just too cold and empty. Both actors spurt out blips and blurbs but do nothing to tie what their saying to anything. Hedlund's lines especially are just filled with cheap one-line bits, that lose their humor after awhile.Again, it's like the film is so ""perfectly"" scripted that it doesn't allow for emotional imperfection to be portrayed on the big screen. I don't really buy into the stories of the two main characters or their relationship. Hedlund, as Sam Flynn, doesn't convey any emotion with his father Kevin (Jeff Bridges). His father's been missing for years and years and yet there is no release of the incredible tension and emotion that one would think would be present between them. They just kind of waive off all those years and move on instantly, because that get's us into more visual effects scenes. The story worked in the first act of the film, where it attempts to develop a relationship between father and son, but midway through the plot just fell apart. It became all about the chase and the action between the good guys and the bad guys. It fell into typical Hollywood blockbuster action and special effects mode with a hollow center.As an Architect myself, I've spent much of my life looking at ""perfect"" photos of buildings, spaces, and landscapes. And for many years, I never paid attention to what was missing in all those photos. Instead, I always oohed and awed over the building's structure, materials, details, etc. I'd notice the furniture, the light fixtures, the plants, the artwork, the door hardware, and all the things that go into creating architecture. What was missing? People. People are imperfect...so they are almost always left out of architectural photos. But people are who use architecture. People are who design and build and enjoy the buildings and spaces that we architects create. ""The Grid"" in the world of Tron feels more like an architecture photo to me than a movie. I oohed and awed while I looked at Tron's incredible structures, materials, and details. But after being satisfied as an Architect, I became dissatisfied as a Cinephile and a person. Movies ultimately are about people and their stories and their emotions and their imperfections. Architecture is an incredible art and I love being an Architect, creating things from nothing but my imagination. But it's people who are important both on the screen, behind the screen, and in front of the screen. And it's our stories that keep us interested in the screen. I think Director/Architect Joseph Kosinski naively got lost in creating buildings, spaces, and the world of Tron, like most architects would, and didn't spend enough time creating the people, characters and emotions to inhabit that incredible world. I'll be curious to see what he creates next time.",3,"Visually and Acoustically Stunning, But Lacking a Soul",1293840000,"01 1, 2011",2011,4756,"['saw', 'Tron', 'Legacy', '2010', 'big', 'screen', 'opening', 'day', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'visual', 'architecture', 'film', 'simply', 'breathtaking', 'music', 'sound', 'film', 'deep', 'powerful', 'incredible', 'Daft', 'Punk', 'created', 'incredible', 'score', 'film', 'worthy', 'checking', 'out', 'own', ""'m"", 'absolutely', 'amazed', 'how', 'digital', 'world', 'was', 'imagined', 'created', 'Director', 'Joseph', 'Kosinski', 'education', 'background', 'architecture', 'was', 'clearly', 'brilliant', 'Architect', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'world', 'directorial', 'debut', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Kosinski', 'was', 'trusted', 'massive', 'film', 'first', 'outing', 'director', 'are', 'scenes', 'are', 'simply', 'EPIC', 'will', 'live', 'forever', 'cinematic', 'history', 'had', 'goosebumps', 'chills', 'times', 'anticipation', 'visuals', 'music', 'overall', 'film', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'high', 'expectations', 'watching', 'trailers', 'last', 'year', 'good', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'worthy', 'seeing', 'big', 'screen', 'spectacle', 'digital', 'wonderland', 'eye-', 'aural-candy', 'movie', 'felt', 'bit', 'empty', 'tried', 'so', 'hard', 'have', 'soul', 'great', 'film', 'lesson', 'teach', 'story', 'imperfection', 'perfect', 'not', 'perfection', 'Perfection', 'actually', 'imperfect', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'tries', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'perfect.I', 'give', 'Tron', 'Legacy', '3.5', 'stars', '5', 'definitely', 'entertaining', 'many', 'ways', 'mentioned', 'above', 'marketing', 'film', 'worked', ""'ve"", 'been', 'anticipating', 'film', 'year', 'just', 'had', 'see', 'theater', 'opening', 'day', 'even', 'was', 'never', 'fan', 'original', 'film', 'think', 'biggest', 'flaws', 'movie', 'are', 'writing', 'acting', 'directing', 'fulfill', 'promise', 'seemed', 'possible', 'trailers', 'sequel', 'original', 'Tron', '1982', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'father', 'son', 'do', 'best', 'bring', 'life', 'story', 'relationship', 'just', 'too', 'cold', 'empty', 'actors', 'spurt', 'out', 'blips', 'blurbs', 'do', 'nothing', 'tie', 'what', 'saying', 'anything', 'Hedlund', 'lines', 'especially', 'are', 'just', 'filled', 'cheap', 'one-line', 'bits', 'lose', 'humor', 'awhile.Again', 'film', 'so', 'perfectly', 'scripted', ""n't"", 'allow', 'emotional', 'imperfection', 'be', 'portrayed', 'big', 'screen', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'buy', 'stories', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'relationship', 'Hedlund', 'Sam', 'Flynn', ""n't"", 'convey', 'emotion', 'father', 'Kevin', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'father', 'been', 'missing', 'years', 'years', 'yet', 'release', 'incredible', 'tension', 'emotion', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'present', 'just', 'kind', 'waive', 'years', 'move', 'instantly', 'get', 'more', 'visual', 'effects', 'scenes', 'story', 'worked', 'first', 'act', 'film', 'where', 'develop', 'relationship', 'father', 'son', 'midway', 'plot', 'just', 'fell', 'apart', 'became', 'chase', 'action', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'fell', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'blockbuster', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'mode', 'hollow', 'center.As', 'Architect', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'much', 'life', 'looking', 'perfect', 'photos', 'buildings', 'spaces', 'landscapes', 'many', 'years', 'never', 'paid', 'attention', 'what', 'was', 'missing', 'photos', 'Instead', 'always', 'oohed', 'awed', 'building', 'structure', 'materials', 'details', 'etc', ""'d"", 'notice', 'furniture', 'light', 'fixtures', 'plants', 'artwork', 'door', 'hardware', 'things', 'go', 'creating', 'architecture', 'What', 'was', 'missing', 'People', 'People', 'are', 'imperfect', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'left', 'architectural', 'photos', 'people', 'are', 'who', 'use', 'architecture', 'People', 'are', 'who', 'design', 'build', 'enjoy', 'buildings', 'spaces', 'architects', 'create', 'Grid', 'world', 'Tron', 'feels', 'more', 'architecture', 'photo', 'movie', 'oohed', 'awed', 'looked', 'Tron', 'incredible', 'structures', 'materials', 'details', 'being', 'satisfied', 'Architect', 'became', 'dissatisfied', 'Cinephile', 'person', 'Movies', 'ultimately', 'are', 'people', 'stories', 'emotions', 'imperfections', 'Architecture', 'incredible', 'art', 'love', 'being', 'Architect', 'creating', 'things', 'nothing', 'imagination', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'important', 'screen', 'screen', 'front', 'screen', 'stories', 'keep', 'interested', 'screen', 'think', 'Director/Architect', 'Joseph', 'Kosinski', 'naively', 'got', 'lost', 'creating', 'buildings', 'spaces', 'world', 'Tron', 'most', 'architects', 'would', 'did', ""n't"", 'spend', 'enough', 'time', 'creating', 'people', 'characters', 'emotions', 'inhabit', 'incredible', 'world', ""'ll"", 'be', 'curious', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'time']",N/A

Without question there is absolutely no comparisons that can, or should be made in terms of special effects. Things have changed immensely since 1982. I think Disney also clearly understood this time that the true audience for 'Tron: Legacy' were adults and provided an appropriate technology, philosophy and storyline to satisfy that target group.There's definitely not much to complain about in this film. I like the fact that Both Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner reprised their roles from the original, I think Garrett Hedlund gave a strong, believable performance, as did Olivia Wilde, the soundtrack is absolutely hypnotizing and the special effects certainly do not disappoint. In my opinion the storyline is also much stronger than the original. Of course the fact that there was an original film to use as a foundation and expand upon doesn't hurt one bit.Unlike most Tron fans (I'm making an assumption here that may or may not be valid) it's not the technological implications of the film that attract me. What really intrigues me is the association of Flynn, or any user with divinity.

1313219,A11SPSEM08VIXX,B002ZG99QS,"Carbonadam ""Ladies and gentleman, I hope that...","[3, 9]","I remember seeing the original Tron back in 1982 and thought it was a lot of fun. Back then the film just came out with little fanfare prior to its release. Nowadays every film comes out with an entire economy of junk and press months, sometimes years, ahead of it. Generally nothing winds up satisfying expectations with all this hoopla in advance. Never mind the current addiction to cynicism everyone seems to have. Nothing is good. Everything is lame. Mockery on everything is the language of the day. Ugh. How did we become so jaded? I am sad at how much vitriol is wasted on films just meant to be enjoyed. Scathing reviews as if people were just robbed of all their earthly possessions.For me the original Tron sits firmly alongside fun childhood films like The Black Hole, The Dark Crystal, Time Bandits, and Flash Gordon. The films were all tons of fun. None of them were meant to be masterpieces. Most of the time I saw films only once and had to live with them in my mind's memory for years on end with no possibility of re-watching them. Many films just came and went and no one kicking up much fuss. The NYT Janet Maslin review back in 1982 was not kind to the original but now the current review claims Tron Legacy did not live up to the original.  How is this possible? The incongruous reviews are because those involved in the reviewing process cared little then and care even less now. They know, somewhere because perhaps someone told them, that a group of people exists that hold the original in high regard. They write the new review, possibly after scanning the DVD at high speed or watching it once to sound like they know what the hell they are talking about but in the end they simply do not care. They probably do not even like science fiction. And even if they do they are too old, too cynical, too job oriented to just sit back and have some fun.Fast forward from the original crappy reviews almost 30 years and now the sequel to Tron is out and the reviews are claiming Tron Legacy is nothing like the original, not nearly as good. Never mind the fact that no one cared for the original even when it came out and were it not for the VHS, Laserdisc, DVD fan base all these years this sequel would not even exist. The original was a simple portal film where a dude goes into a computer to stop an evil computer program from taking over the world. The original could easily be criticized with the same sword many are wielding on the new one today. Seriously though, all faults the original may and do have are all forgiven because real fans love these old films anyway despite any flaws. The flaws give them charm. It was a B film that some people loved over time. It reminds me of childhood, of the 80s, of videogames, of the beginnings of the personal computer that has since become ubiquitous to all. They are charming and fun and remind us of our childhood. We like the hokey plot and don't care to over analyze any flawed logic. This is art, not some logical mind game.  Now 28 years later reviewers who could care less for the original are holding it up as some pillar when they do not even know what they are writing about.Just the very fact that a sequel is out is amazing to me. The Thing was a flop the very same year (1982) as Tron and I did not even see that film till years later. Now that too will get a prequel and some pseudo highbrow at the NYT will review it as if the original is some old fine wine they have loved and cherished forever. I love the original Tron and I can tell you even I did not care about it much when it came out. The way the reviewers are panning the new film makes it seem as if everyone loved the original and it was some smash hit. It wasn't. I did not care much till years later. Even schlock fun cinema today is approached by everyone as if it needs to be the height of storytelling as if ever story man has ever told has led up to Tron Legacy and anything less than God like perfection is garbage. First of all many have simply grown up too much in order to even enjoy good old clean visually excitable cinema. Second, if any of you go and watch Tron legacy with a 10 year old I dare you to tell them it was lame, and then explain why. I double dog dare you. And if you do, you'll have Scroodge-McGrinch written all over your face, and you'll have shut the bright happy wide eyes of some cool kid. The simple fact is that were this the film that came out 28 years ago with the SFX of the time and the original Tron were created today with modern SFX as a prequel all the same criticisms would be written of it.When I got Tron on laserdisc years ago I put the disc in, cranked up the volume, and jumped to the light cycle scene. No one used to give a hoot about this film but a hand full of us nerds. Now everyone is suddenly a connoisseur of the original when 1/2 of them are not even old enough to have been there to generate the cult status it now has that let this sequel become possible. No one was there writing dozens of big articles on the failure of the first film because back then cinema like this mattered less to the populace as a whole and more to the individual.  It's ironic that a film that flopped in the 80s gets a sequel 30 years later that is considered not as poignant and heartfelt as the original. Get over yourselves everyone and do me a favor, unless you owned the Laserdisc of Tron stop yammering that this one was no good. It was just as good if not better. And after waiting 28 years and sitting in the theater watching it with my wide-eyed 9 year old son who kept giving me the thumbs up every 5 minutes I can tell you it was well worth the wait.",5,Great

This is lovely, eerie, jaw-dropping science fiction adventure that is both agreeable Disney family fare and a stunning futuristic opus. I originally saw this in Bangkok, Thailand, where many Thais don't seem aware that this is a sequel. Some of the imagery recalls some of the 80's and 90's issues of Heavy Metal Magazine. Emotions run higher in this film, and there are great moments which suggest a very strange new human digital evolution to come (in the hoped-for episode 3- please not another 28 years of waiting).The dvd has great quality, though some may be overwhelmed by the 3-D imagery (especially those light-paths left in the wake of the rushing light cycles). The soundtrack is heavy and fantastically loud, so that you can appreciate the thundering sound FX and Daft Punk's powerful (and also underrated) dance-tech and symphonic film score.

It's simply a well made movie, and the effort from everyone involved shows.Jeff Bridges makes this movie stand out with his performance(s).  Garrett Hedlund did an outstanding job, especially with how demanding the role was mentally and physically.  Olivia Wilde was cast perfectly in playing the naive, yet intelligent and capable character Quorra.The visuals are amazing, and they stand on their own.  I'm someone who's easily put off by excessive CGI in movies (Indiana Jones 4 was terrible, the CGI brought it down even further), but Tron: Legacy is a movie where CGI actually helps make the movie, as it takes place in a digital world (Star Wars Episodes I - III however does not take place in a digital world, hence it looked bad, and the technology used to film those movies wasn't as advanced as it is today, just as an example of where I'm coming from).The score was amazing.  When I found out it was Daft Punk who scored the music, I was taken back after realizing who they were.  I'm  not a fan of their other work, but I do have respect for them after hearing their work for this movie.  The music worked flawlessly with each scene, as it added to the emotional situation perfectly.The story was perfect.  A touch of a Nazi Germany theme along with a father son story in the middle helped make this movie very much enjoyable.I went into watching this movie for the first time expecting an excessively high level of quirkiness and lameness (I was not familiar with the Tron series before seeing this). I also expected that those who made this movie might have approached it as a money making project where I'd only see a ""cookie cutter"" like movie (Example: The Pirates of the Caribbean movies) - I'm very glad I was wrong, and I'm also glad that I gave this movie a chance; a well deserved/earned chance.Finally - I'm accustomed to people making comments on reviews for DVDs/Blu-rays in stating that they only want a review of the product, the product being the format alone, not the actual film/story.  In response to anyone who is tempted to make such a comment (I know you're out there), this IS a review of the product, as I bought the movie, I didn't just buy a blu-ray.

Did I miss the point when I left ""Tron: Legacy"" feeling it was a monumental failure as a story? If I'm to continue with this review, I must first make it clear that I don't see the ""Tron"" films in the same way a lot of people do. I don't believe they deserve praise simply for their innovative special effects; I personally require an engaging plot, character development, and the sense that it's operating under a heightened but nonetheless understandable set of rules. In other words, I like a good sci-fi/fantasy film, but not when all effort is put into visuals and absolutely nothing is put into the screenplay. If that makes me a prude who wouldn't know a cool movie even if it came up and bit me, feel free to stop reading and start searching the web for a more enthusiastic review.Just like its 1982 predecessor, watching ""Tron: Legacy"" is a little like watching a demo reel from the visual effects department - all flash and bang but no substance. It makes not the slightest effort to be plausible or consistent, it freely glosses over glaring technicalities, the dialogue is unbelievably awkward, and the performances are wasted on characters with no depth. The plot is convoluted and impenetrable, and it seems the more it tries to explain, the less sense it makes. The entire concept of people living inside a computer is a logistical nightmare, but if I start rattling off a list, I fear I might not be able to stop. Its greatest offense is not having any audience in mind other than the original film's fan base, which, when you think about, hardly seems big enough to have warranted a sequel in the first place.I will admit that the film is a dazzling sight to behold. I was especially impressed with work done on the character of Clu, a hacking program; he was designed to look exactly like his creator, Kevin Flynn, but since people age and computer programs do not, it was necessary to digitally reconstruct the face of Jeff Bridges as it appeared over twenty years ago. The results are uncannily convincing. With just a little more development, we may someday see digital recreations of bygone Hollywood icons and not notice a difference. Imagine it - Humphrey Bogart acting alongside Ingrid Bergman in a sequel to ""Casablanca.""Since the events of the first film, Flynn got married, had a son, became a widower, and was promoted to CEO of a computer corporation called ENCOM International. He disappeared in 1989, leaving behind his son, Sam, and vague promises of a cutting edge digital revolution, one he claimed would forever change science, medicine, and religion. The story begins twenty years later, when a now twenty-seven-year-old Sam (Garrett Hedlund) breaks into ENCOM headquarters, distributes their newest operating system over the internet for free, uploads a virus into their mainframe, and escapes by jumping off the rooftop and releasing a parachute he just happened to have stowed away on his person. After his arrest and release, Sam is approached by ENCOM's consultant and Flynn's old friend Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner), who says he received a page from Flynn's office, the number of which has been disconnected for twenty years. So help me God, the man is still using a pager.Upon entering his father's abandoned arcade, Sam discovers a secret room with a miraculously functional computer and a fully operational laser; with a few careless strokes of the keyboard, Sam is zapped with light and transported into the computer world, known as the Grid. We then witness must have been an homage to the sepia-tone-to-Technicolor transition shown in ""The Wizard of Oz""; the film shifts from 2D to 3D, which is a new one on me. Sam is immediately captured by electronically-voiced guards in black suits with glowing orange stripes. After being stripped of his earthly clothes, fitted with a black suit with glowing blue stripes, and linked with a memory-storing disc that doubles as a Frisbee, he's pitted against Flynn's program, Clu (Jeff Bridges), who has since turned evil. He's then forced to participate in games of survival, including a race on digital motorcycles that trail light behind them. He's rescued by a program named Quorra (Olivia Wilde) and driven away from the city into the surrounding mountains. Mountains. In a computer grid. And there are clouds in the sky, too.I will now stop describing the plot and move on to some of the little things that drove me mad. There's a house stocked with furniture, physical paper books, and food. I must assume it's not some digital replication, for Sam is able to eat it without a problem. There's a club high atop a sky rise in the heart of the computer city, where a program played by Michael Sheen struts around with a cane and speaks like a Dr. Frank N. Furter wannabe. There's an ending which begs the question of how anything created in a computer could ever exist in the physical human world. After all, it's all just a bunch of immaterial zeros and ones. The fact that I'm fixated on this when I'm supposed to be enjoying myself should tell you everything you need to know.

I love the graphics of Legacy, but the de-rezzing of the original. There is a rather interesting story to each. Each is a product of the times. I think if one were to think how one would do a follow up to the original Tron, one would at least take some of the basics from Legacy. Kevin would have re-booted the Grid. He would have created a Clu type character. The system would have ended up pretty close to what we see in the movie.  The ISOs? Sure, why not? Every system has its anomoly or anomolies. Would the Codified Likeness Utility ended up how it did? Sure, why not? It would be a mirror of its creator at the time of its creation. I like the choices for each of the characters. I think this keeps in the spirit of the original as well as creating a new mythos for the Tron universe. As to the ending...if there is a sequel to this, I could come up with a handful of reasons either way why Flynn could survive or not. I mean, really, the greatest code writer of that universes decade creates a digital frontier and doesn't create a fail-safe for if/when something goes wrong? As someone who at least comprehends the extreme basics of code writing (at least from roughly the same time), one would always have a backup. Kevin Flynn, at least in theory, could have survived. Whether or not he did, that would remain to be seen. Great movie. Great concept.

1313232,A24F1UX8ZT5IXY,B002ZG99QS,C.J. Hustwick,"[4, 10]","This sequel is a total disaster. Joseph Kosinski cannot direct actors or craft anything but the most cliched of scenes, and even his eye for visual effects lacks discipline; shots are loaded with egregious lightning flashes, poor use of particle effects, and a certain monomania in all aspects of audio / visual design. I actually think there are a few decent ideas in the script (Clu turning evil, Boxleitner's cameo, the Lightcycle course), but all are mangled by dreadful execution. Then we have ""Zen Master"" Kevin Flynn, evil Dillinger Jr., computer vixens prancing around in platform heels and inch-thick eye shadow, ""2001"" rip-off furniture, going back to the arcade (where there's a Tron game!), a motorcycle-riding jock as son of Flynn... it's all just beyond hokey.For all of the film's technical prowess, it does not hold a candle to its predecessor from nearly 30 years earlier even as eye candy. The kitchen sink production design deviates tremendously from the stark, haunting grid envisioned by Syd Mead and Moebius; Kosinski's world looks more like a ride at the Luxor Hotel (Fireworks... really?). Gone too is Wendy Carlos, replaced by the danceclub beats of Daft Punk... which are a bit of a mixed bag. It makes the whole thing feel a bit like being at a late-90s rave, and maybe that was the idea. Unfortunately for stock ticker DIS this sexed-up/dumbed-down approach did not translate into titanic revenues; this film grossed less than half of either The Dark Knight or Avatar worldwide.The original Tron was not a perfect film, but its spirit and originality, its conception of the burgeoning world of computers helped define an era, and lived up to Walt Disney's dream of breaking new ground with his company's films. The destruction of the MCP, its bizarre worlds and charming interludes (e.g. with the byte), along with some genuine creepiness earned Tron a solid place not only in the Disney canon, but I think it fares quite well alongside many classic Sci-Fi films like ""Things To Come"".

1313235,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B002ZG99QS,C. Sawin,"[5, 10]","TRON: Legacy has been one of the most promoted films of the year. With a monstrous budget (around $200 million) and reports saying that Disney is worried that the film isn't tracking as well as they'd hoped, the initial thought process from these rumors is that the TRON sequel will open to a disappointing first place weekend much like the most recent Chronicles of Narnia film. As of this writing, I haven't gotten around to seeing the original film. I wanted to, but thanks to Disney it was pretty much pulled from every retail store imaginable whether you wanted to rent or purchase the film at least until next year. The urge to see TRON: Legacy didn't really sink in until around the time the third trailer was released. While the Daft Punk score has interested me from the beginning, TRON: Legacy just seemed like another overrated piece of eye candy that fanboys were getting excited about. The thing about first impressions though is that they always have the opportunity to be wrong.It's been twenty years since Kevin Flynn (Bridges) had made some miraculous breakthrough on what he only referred to as The Grid and mysteriously disappeared. Over the years without his father around, Sam (Hedlund) became reckless and spends his time sabotaging ENCOM, the company he inherited. Alan Bradley (Boxleitner), a friend of Kevin's who still works for ENCOM, pays a visit to Sam telling him that he's received a page from his father from a number that's been disconnected since his father's disappearance. Feeling doubtful and skeptical, Sam goes to investigate where the page originated from; Flynn's Arcade, his father's original workspace. It's here that Sam is transported to the digital world his father always talked about, The Grid. Sam is captured upon arrival and forced to compete in the games of the mysterious world. Sam crosses paths with a program named Clu, who looks exactly like his father did 20 years ago and wants nothing more than to prevent Kevin's escape from The Grid. Once the light cycles enter the equation and Sam's life seems to be in danger, Quorra (Wilde) makes her presence known. After saving Sam, Quorra takes him to meet his father. After the Flynn's reunite, they must come up with a plan that'll help get them all home without running into Clu along the way; a feat that is much more difficult and dangerous than it seems.The glorified TRON sequel is getting a lot of mixed reviews from most movie critics. The problem seems to lie within the way the film is written and its screenplay. To tell the truth, you don't see a movie like this for a great story alone. The special effects are the main attraction and boy, do they deliver. The way programs disintegrate when they're disposed of, the light cycle battles, airborne chases, and the many fight sequences in the film are just a small example of the dazzling display of some of the most exceptional and impressive special effects ever seen in a cinematic feature. As with most films that have been presented in 3D lately, the 3D effect probably isn't necessary to enjoy a film of this magnitude. It'll be just as entertaining if you save yourself the extra $4 and see it in a conventional theater.The writing didn't seem as bothersome as much as other reports say. It certainly wasn't the best, but it seemed like enough to add just the right amount of depth to TRON: Legacy and give it more of a background than most films revolving around spectacular special effects. There were a few lines that bothered me. The main one being when Alan first visits Sam and Sam says something about his father probably either being dead or chilling in Costa Rica...or both. Wait, what? It just gives you this Weekend at Bernie's flashback with Bernie being replaced with Kevin Flynn's limp carcass. Some of the lines Jeff Bridges muttered just made him seem way too much like The Dude from The Big Lebowski, which seems awesome but really has no place in the TRON universe. Saying things like, ""Check this out,"" or, ""Radical, man,"" followed by that stoner laugh of his really didn't help matters much. The weak points of the way the film is written are rectified with the way the film never lets your attention out of its chokehold. You'll be drawn to the screen the entire film; that's practically a guarantee. The right mindset for a film like this can make or break your opinion of the film. If you don't have inflated expectations and don't expect much more than impressive special effects, then you'll probably walk away pleasantly surprised. I actually had a similar mindset during Avatar, which seemed to also suffer/take advantage of groundbreaking special effects being more consuming than the story and had a similar result.The cast is about as developed as can be expected. The real star of the film is Garrett Hedlund, who does a pretty decent job of carrying the film and being generally astonished that not only was his father alive but the extraordinary world he always talked about actually existed. Jeff Bridges' performance isn't nearly as strong as his portrayal of Rooster Cogburn in True Grit, but he does have his moments. He seems to shine during his reunion with Hedlund and his strongest scenes are with Hedlund alone while being rather flat the rest of the time. Olivia Wilde's Quorra is interesting, as well. There's an intriguing twist to her character, but her fascination and curiosity revolving around the world Sam is from is what gives her character heart. Michael Sheen did seem a bit too over the top at times as Castor, but that may have been the point. The biggest surprise was seeing Cillian Murphy cameo. Given his strong outings in films like Sunshine, Peacock, and Inception, it just left me wanting to see more of his character in future installments assuming this film does well enough to warrant a sequel (or sequels).TRON: Legacy is certainly the special effects extravaganza it's been made out to be all year. Its fantastic effects certify the sequel as being the most visually appealing film of the year. While the writing of the film isn't quite as polished as the special effects, there certainly seems to be a good enough balance to keep the film afloat and deliver an extremely entertaining way to kill two hours. As far as eye candy goes, TRON: Legacy is an incredible and all around awesome experience.",4,The most visually appealing film of 2010,1292457600,"12 16, 2010",2010,6336,"['TRON', 'Legacy', 'been',

The picture and sound are amazing.Disney did a great job on this release except for one area, the special features. About 30 minutes total talking about pre production, visuals and the cast. A Flynn lives segment, Daft Punk video, not much. A huge disappointment for me. You can not tell me their are not hours of set design and costume design behind the scenes stuff. You get to see tidbits of the design process in the 10 minute videos, but nothing extensive. I really wanted to see the body casting, design process, making of the suits, lighting challenges of the suits documentary, just a small hint was shown. Also, no directors commentary.One of the things that makes this movie work for is the Daft Punk soundtrack. It makes this movie sound amazing along with the top notch visuals.

1313242,A2XMBWQL0LGNJD,B002ZG99QS,Dave Cordes,"[8, 11]","28 years, 161 days later, Tron's legacy lives on. Joe Kosinkski's understated long-awaited sequel to Steven Lisberger's game changing electronic mythos is a visual triumph, a world unlike anything we've ever seen before, transforming the iconography of its predecessor into an awesome 3D spectacle, but it is an imperfect world, its breathtaking three dimensions propped upon the two dimensional pillars of its problematic plot and one that would be looked upon with the consternation of its biggest adversary who, ironically, is the one who nearly completely undermines and very nearly derezzes it... Clu... and the guy doesn't dig imperfection.The film's biggest special effect is also its biggest failure. The technology that I had hoped would be the promise of taking Tron once again to a new revolutionary cinematic level and breaking new technical ground in much the same way as the original film had ushered in a new era at the dawn of the digital filmmaking frontier demonstrates that we still have quite a ways to go before digital actors can convincingly look indistinguishable from real human performers and reinforces the theory of the ""Uncanny Valley"" in robotics that says the closer we get to making artificial constructs look human the more we can identify their subtle inhuman imperfections. The CGI animation used to make Jeff Bridges look 20 years younger more closely resemble the animated cut-scenes from its video game counterpartTRON: Evolution. Comparing it to how he looks in other earlier films of his career likeStarmanit's obvious that Bridges did not look quite like his poorly rendered doppleganger at that age. The eyes, the brows, the cheekbones, and the mouth have an unconvincing artificiality about them that betrays the illusion and his aged voice also belies the effect. In a creepy sort of way it almost works for the character within the context of the story because he is supposed to be an artificial construct and we can almost buy that he doesn't look quite like a real human being, but during the film's opening scenes when we see Bridges in flashback playing younger Kevin Flynn telling bedtime stories to his son, Sam, it robs the moment between a father and his son of its already forced sincerity and dehumanizes it in a cold and unsettling way.The plot is almost video-game like in its objective as the competing faction of Clu's militaristic forces must obtain elder Flynn's identity disc which is a master key to unlock the door to our world so that he and his army can take it over. It is never convincingly explained how exactly virtual programs existing in the digital world can somehow manifest themselves into tangible living matter in our physical world with Flynn's disc like a magician pulling a rabbit out of an ethereal hat, just as it does not attempt to explain why a User like Sam can bleed in its digital realm other than the fact he is simply a User and ""he's different,"" nor does it attempt to explain how Kevin Flynn has aged 20 years trapped in his digital confinement when theoretically he shouldn't have physically aged at all as a digital avatar of himself. Narratively it misses those opportunities to explore such metaphysical questions as it so masterfully eluded to in the film's promising test trailer shown at Comic Con the way that the originalTronexplored such intriguing philosophical ideas around the religious beliefs of its programs and their creators. Tron Legacy's most astonishing revelation delivered by Alan when he tells Sam that his father was about to change science, medicine and religion in such a profound way is simply thrown away in a single line of expository dialogue. We never learn the real reason why Flynn created this world in the first place other than the fact that it was far out biodigital jazz, man.Once again Jeff Bridges is the chemistry that holds the foundations of the Troniverse together solely with his strength and conviction of his performance as zen guru cyber-Jesus Flynn to his Judas megalomaniacal alter-ego Clu in some sort of virtual yin and yang. Garret Hedlund is surprisingly likeable as his son, Sam. Thankfully, he's no wooden Hayden Christiansen (although he would have made a much better Anakin Skywalker) and plays the cliched angst-ridden rebellious youth with convincingly noble admiration. Reciprocally, Olivia Wilde plays the character of Quorra with a truthful childlike innocence and wonder that demonstrates she has more to offer as an actress than just luscious fanboy eyecandy. Michael Sheen livens the film as Castor with his jestly rendition of David Bowie circa glam rock era Ziggy Stardust. And once again Bruce Boxleitner returns as Alan Bradley aka Tron... sort of. After all it's called TRON Legacy, right? Though, like the first film, the story is centered around Flynn's character and his legacy of which Tron is merely incidental to. The enigmatic character of Rinzler is Clu's henchman, one part Darth Maul wielding two discs, and one part Boba Fett as a mysterious tracker whose helmeted identity is concealed and it doesn't take half a nerd to figure out who he is.As a 3D film Tron Legacy's illuminated electronic visuals perfectly lends itself to creating brightly rendered 3D images which has been the pitfall of all other 3D films. Tron Legacy is by far the real Avatar. It makes the world of Pandora look like a cartoon by comparison. The Grid is a place I would want to visit again because it is unlike anything seen in our world or any other. The brilliantly 3D rendered Disney logo showcasing the Magic Kingdom ""Tronified"" is appropriately memorable for setting the tone of the film which is then 2D until Sam is transported into Tron's colorful three dimensional illuminated world like Dorothy in theThe Wizard of Oz. As a first-time director Joe Kosinski proves that he has the technical prowess to design a fully immersive world much like Ridley Scott did with Alien and Blade Runner but his weakness is marshaling a bullet-proof script equally as flawless to support it, but then again the original Tron, to be fair, didn't necessarily have a solid script to support it either so in that sense they are both equally as flawed and both equally as visually stunning.As a fan of the original Tron I am torn. Part of me is protective of its mythos and at the same time heartbroken that what was once a unique, groundbreaking film has now been rendered obsolete by its own sequel that has taken the technology and improved upon it in nearly every visual way. The Lightcycle and Disc Wars sequences, for example, are spectacularly exhilarating and render the graphics in the original film relics of the Atari age by comparison and why Disney has wisely kept the original Tron film hidden away in its vaults and hasn't released it on blu-ray yet to avoid the inevitably unfair comparisons. Fortunately as a sequel it delivers without the bitter disappointment of sequels like Star Wars or Indiana Jones. It's no Phantom Menace or Crystal Skull, thank God. If it performs well there will no doubt be more Tron films that confident Disney has stated they already have in development along with an animated TV show Tron Uprising and will hopefully include the participation of Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner to make them work. Without them, it wouldn't be a Tron film at all. Tron lives. He fights for the Users.END OF LINE",4,"Bio-digital Jazz, man!",1292544000,"12 17, 2010",2010,7381,"['28', 'years', '161', 'days', 'later', 'Tron', 'legacy', 'Joe', 'Kosinkski', 'understated',

If you love tech movies with computers turning evil you will love this movie.  This movie is great on Blu Ray and looks and sounds amazing.  I saw this movie in Theatres in 3D, but actually like it better in 2D (even at the theatres it states it does not have full 3D throughout the movie).  My only nit picky thing is that the movie often changes between filling the screen and having black bars on top and bottom throughout the movie (it tells you at the beginning it tries to preserve the IMAX size for some parts).  -- So that it sort of weird...  In all it is a fun movie, has plenty of action to keep everyone engaged, and is safe for kids (no language, just a little violence)!  Highly recommend, and also if you have not seen the original Tron movie it has also been released on Blu Ray!!!  So this way you can see the earlier story.  Although, you do not need to know the original movie to follow the new one, but it would help identifying characters easier, since most are the same from the original!",5,Great Movie!!,1302134400,"04 7, 2011",2011,1104,"['was', 'great', 'movie', 'plenty', 'action', 'beautiful', 'graphics', 'keep', 'intrigued', 'love', 'tech', 'movies', 'computers', 'turning', 'evil', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'movie', 'great', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'amazing', 'saw', 'movie', 'Theatres', '3D', 'actually', 'better', '2D', 'even', 'theatres', 'not', 'have', 'full', '3D', 'movie', 'only', 'nit', 'picky', 'thing', 'movie', 'often', 'filling', 'screen', 'having', 'black', 'bars', 'top', 'bottom', 'movie', 'beginning', 'preserve', 'IMAX', 'size', 'parts', 'sort', 'weird', 'fun', 'movie', 'plenty', 'action', 'keep', 'everyone', 'engaged', 'safe', 'kids', 'language', 'just', 'little', 'violence', 'Highly', 'recommend', 'also', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'Tron', 'movie', 'also', 'been', 'released', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'So', 'way', 'can', 'see', 'earlier', 'story', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'know', 'original', 'movie', 'follow', 'new', 'one', 'would', 'help', 'identifying', 'characters', 'easier', 'most', 'are', 'same', 'original']",N/A
1313246,AD566OQG88ORV,B002ZG99QS,David Feeney,"[1, 5]","To me, Tron legacy represents the adult realization that just because you liked something as a child doesn't mean it will hold up when you're an adult. Case in point; Tron, a mediocre B movie from the early 80s which had some cool special effects though in a bad way even by 80s standards. But the idea was novel; a man is trapped in a video game. It was a boring film, but people liked it, mainly because they were children and didn't know any better.Fast forward something like twenty-eight years to Tron Legacy. Great potential. I admit, I was blown away by the trailer. The notion of Jeff Bridges' son following him into the digital world to find/rescue him was outstanding. The thought of how the digital world has developed a-la the internet kept my mind racing.Truth be told, the movie was boring. It was great to see 'The Dude,' in the digital world battling a younger version of himself. And the effects were outstanding. But you'd think after twenty-eight years they'd have come up with some kind of a plot. Don't get me wrong Tron Legacy has a lot of bells and whistles. Not to mention eye candy.But seriously, the bad guys can't find the dude who's living by himself on a mountain within eye sight of the city? He's the only one on the mountain. You can see a light coming from his house! Nobody ever asked; I wonder who lives up there?The Matrix covered this ground better.When I hear people raving about how great it was, it reminds me of all those guys back in 97 coming out of 'The Phantom Menace,' Light Sabers in hand, for the tenth time saying things like, 'This one just sets things up.' And 'George will come out swinging with the next one. You'll see.'Just my opinion.By David Feeney, AuthorTerror On The High Seas",1,"Twenty-eight years, you'd think they'd come up with a better plot",1360713600,"02 13, 2013",2013,1736,"['Tron', 'legacy', 'adult', 'realization', 'just', 'liked', 'something', 'child', ""n't"", 'mean', 'will', 'hold', 'up', 'when', ""'re"", 'adult', 'Case', 'point', 'Tron', 'mediocre', 'B', 'movie', 'early', '80s', 'had', 'cool', 'special', 'effects', 'bad', 'way', 'even', '80s', 'standards', 'idea', 'was', 'novel', 'man', 'trapped', 'video', 'game', 'was', 'boring', 'film', 'people', 'liked', 'mainly', 'were', 'children', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'better.Fast', 'forward', 'something', 'twenty-eight', 'years', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'Great', 'potential', 'admit', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'trailer', 'notion', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'son', 'following', 'digital', 'world', 'find/rescue', 'was', 'outstanding', 'thought', 'how', 'digital', 'world', 'developed', 'internet', 'kept', 'mind', 'racing.Truth', 'be', 'told', 'movie', 'was', 'boring', 'was', 'great', 'see', ""'The"", 'Dude', 'digital', 'world', 'battling', 'younger', 'version', 'effects', 'were', 'outstanding', ""'d"", 'think', 'twenty-eight', 'years', ""'d"", 'have', 'come', 'up', 'kind', 'plot', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'lot', 'bells', 'whistles', 'Not', 'mention', 'eye', 'candy.But', 'seriously', 'bad', 'guys', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'dude', 'who', 'living', 'mountain', 'eye', 'sight', 'city', 'only', 'one', 'mountain', 'can', 'see', 'light', 'coming', 'house', 'Nobody', 'ever', 'asked', 'wonder', 'who', 'up', 'there', 'Matrix', 'covered', 'ground', 'better.When', 'hear', 'people', 'raving', 'how', 'great', 'was', 'guys', 'back', '97', 'coming', ""'The"", 'Phantom', 'Menace', 'Light', 'Sabers', 'hand', 'tenth', 'time', 'saying', 'things', ""'This"", 'one', 'just', 'sets', 'things', 'up', ""'George"", 'will', 'come', 'out', 'swinging', 'next', 'one', ""'ll"", 'see', ""'Just"", 'opinion.By', 'David', 'Feeney', 'AuthorTerror', 'High', 'Seas']",N/A

The special effects are mostly (I'll discuss why ""mostly"" later) incredible and the visual direction of the film is very stunning. They did an excellent job of updating everything from the first film into a stylized futuristic environment that blows us away visually.Tron: Legacy is about Sam Flynn, Kevin Flynn's son, as he searches the computer world for his father who mysteriously disappeared 20 years earlier.This is a fun film to watch and is just really stunning visually. The special effects are all awesome minus one thing - a computer-enhanced younger Jeff Bridges. For the first half of the movie, you may not even realize that he is computer-enhanced. But the character seems to become more and more unrealistic and fake looking as the movie continues. By the end, it is way too obvious that the young Bridges is CG-affected. It is especially noticeable when he talks. It reminds me of The Mummy Returns when you first see the Scorpion King monster near the end of the film - there's all this build up and then you see the monster and you think, ""He looks like a plastic Ken doll placed on a prehistoric dino-toy body."" Disappointing.There were also a lot of loopholes and unanswered questions brought up by the film:*Spoiler Alert*What was the point of the two spheres CLU was using during the disc battle. It seemed that he was using them to control TRON, but they never showed up again. Why?Why did TRON suddenly turn good in the end? What happened that caused this sudden loyalty change?What happens to a program when they enter the human world? Does their body become human? How can a program exist in this world without being human?*End Spoiler Alert*And other questions. Overall, the film was a fun watch and a great update of the original Tron film.

1313256,AU32ZJ0LGMBSA,B002ZG99QS,"dgdbear ""David""","[2, 2]","What can I say? This movie gives you exactly what you're looking for. It has perfect action, perfect style, and perfect characters. Some may complain of its ""boring"" or ""weak"" plot, but for me... it's every action/adventure-lover's dream come true. The light bike scene is the hands-down best action scene this year. Apart from the action, the score of this movie really gives it life. Each of the tracks fit perfectly to the scene and gave me this weightless feeling that is unmatchable. So if you're looking for a movie to be amazed by its script and plot, rent The Social Network or Inception. But if you're looking for an expertly-crafted sci-fi adventure filled with spectacle and wonder, rent (buy) TRON: Legacy.The Visuals: Absolutely Ground-breaking. Never before has computer animation felt so life-like; so realistic yet imaginative. The movie alone features the best visuals (in my opinion) available today. The Blu-ray transfer is the best I have ever seen. The best element is definitely the shifting aspect ratio which gives you an awesome feel every time it changes to full screen. Apart from that, the colors are perfect, the detail is so crisp without being overblown, and the blacks are astounding, so smooth and glossy that it makes you believe you are actually in the movie. If you are looking for a demo disk, look no further. Pop in TRON: Legacy and let your jaw-drop.Now for the Audio: As if the visuals could be matched? The 7.1 surround sound is deafening: in a good way. Scratch that: in a GREAT way. This is absolutely the best audio I've ever heard. Daft Punk's perfect soundtrack will ignite your speakers, and every tiny sound effect will be present in your house. Sounds are crisp and clear, and action sequences will shake your house. If you had any expectations for the audio , you might as well drop them now, because TRON: Legacy shatters them all.The extras: Many have been complaining about these, but really I am quite satisfied. Sure, there could have been more. But there are certain factors that bring up the score for me. For starters, the three featurettes about the movie were really well done; short but sweet. The ""Flynn Lives"" extra was spectacular, providing a great story for fans of the movie: one that gave you hope for a third movie. Finally, what made the disc for me was the incredible main menu: which is the best I have ever seen: Amazing!Finally, the TRON: Legacy Blu-ray disc was everything I would have hoped it to be. Perfect quality to a near-perfect movie with a great amount of extras. I really recommend that you get this Blu-ray because it is one of the best available. The movie is the perfect blockbuster that is backed up with amazing visuals and audio. The disc will be playing in my PS3 for a long time to come.

1313265,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B002ZG99QS,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","TRON: LEGACY - just my two cents - was a fairly cool film. I can't say it was on par with the original (see my review). There has been too much innovation in a short span, and TRON: LEGACY just does not really innovate. In fact, it looked like some odd entry in the STAR WARS franchise.In brief, old Flynn (Jeff Bridges) is lost in cyberspace again - this time to be rescued by his son Sam (a drop-dead gorgeous Garrett Hedlund, BIG upcoming star for this young hunk). While I liked the nods at the original TRON, and loved seeing the set of Flynn's old 1980s arcade, it was all too familiar and a tad boring. The music, desperately trying to grasp a pinch of the old 1980s electronic madness, just fell flat.And what is up with Michael Sheen appearing in weirdo cameos every time I turn around ... is he that strapped for cash?Jeff Bridges is very good in this, I must say. Though his Zen-like existence in cyberspace could have been turned into a zonked-out joke, it actually works. Admittedly, the first scene with the real Flynn gives chills. He looks as if the cyberspace life has pushed him toward enlightenment.Now back to my present focus, which is Garrett Hedlund. This kid (he says he's 27 in the film) is an amazing moving sculpture. His sweet-but-tough Swedish countenance and amazing body is electrifying enough to carry any film. He has the face that seems to be a total combination of Jared Leto, Brad Pitt, Kurt Cobain and River Phoenix; it is his resemblance to the latter that startled me in the beginning.With his powerful, booming voice - a bit like a young James Earl Jones - this young man is going to skyrocket to fame if he plays his cards right. After all, being pretty can also translate into being effective on the Silver Screen. Even with the lack of direction here (this was newbie Joseph Kosinski's first time out) Hedlund lights up the screen.I guess it's a sad but typical review when I go on breathlessly about a particular star while the film leaves me aching for an old kung fu film ....",3,Relatively cool - one hunk can really distract,1312156800,"08 1, 2011",2011,2022,"['TRON', 'LEGACY', 'just', 'two', 'cents', 'was', 'fairly', 'cool', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'par', 'original', 'see', 'review', 'been', 'too', 'much', 'innovation', 'short', 'span', 'TRON', 'LEGACY', 'just', 'not', 'really', 'innovate', 'fact', 'looked', 'odd', 'entry', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'franchise.In', 'brief', 'old', 'Flynn', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'lost', 'cyberspace', 'again', 'time', 'be', 'rescued', 'son', 'Sam', 'drop-dead', 'gorgeous', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'BIG', 'upcoming', 'star', 'young', 'hunk', 'liked', 'nods', 'original', 'TRON', 'loved', 'seeing', 'set', 'Flynn', 'old', '1980s', 'arcade', 'was', 'too', 'familiar', 'tad', 'boring', 'music', 'desperately', 'trying', 'grasp', 'pinch', 'old', '1980s', 'electronic', 'madness', 'just', 'fell', 'flat.And', 'what', 'up', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'appearing', 'weirdo', 'cameos', 'time', 'turn', 'around', 'strapped', 'cash', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'very', 'good', 'must', 'say', 'Zen-like', 'existence', 'cyberspace', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'turned', 'zonked-out', 'joke', 'actually', 'Admittedly', 'first', 'scene', 'real', 'Flynn', 'chills', 'cyberspace', 'life', 'pushed', 'enlightenment.Now', 'back', 'present', 'focus', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'kid', '27', 'film', 'amazing', 'moving', 'sculpture', 'sweet-but-tough', 'Swedish', 'countenance', 'amazing', 'body', 'electrifying', 'enough', 'carry', 'film', 'face', 'be', 'total', 'combination', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'River', 'Phoenix', 'resemblance', 'latter', 'startled', 'beginning.With', 'powerful', 'booming', 'voice', 'bit', 'young', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'young', 'man', 'going', 'skyrocket', 'fame', 'cards', 'right', 'being', 'pretty', 'can', 'also', 'translate', 'being', 'effective', 'Silver', 'Screen', 'Even', 'lack', 'direction', 'here', 'was', 'newbie', 'Joseph', 'Kosinski', 'first', 'time', 'out', 'Hedlund', 'up', 'screen.I', 'guess', 'sad', 'typical', 'review', 'when', 'go', 'breathlessly', 'particular', 'star', 'film', 'aching', 'old', 'kung', 'fu', 'film']",N/A

I own four or five other 3D movies including Kung Fu Panda 2, Alice In Wonderland and Lion King but neither of them present such a clean, clear and crisp 3D image as this movie and Avatar. In my experience, Avatar and Tron are the only two 3D movies that I've seen so far that do 3D the way it should be done and the overall experience is better for it. There may not be many (if any) pop out of the screen 3D effects but the pop out stuff is gimmicky anyway and when it is done, it's usually only to show off that particular effect and doesn't serve the story at all. I think Avatar and Tron got it right. This movie is a visual and audio  feast in 3D and 2D for that matter. My blu-ray player is an OPPO BDP-95 which outputs video to a Panasonic TC-P55VT30 (plasma with professional calibration by Kevin Miller) and my surround system consists of a Yamaha RX-V3800 AVR, Paradigm Studio 100 V.4 mains, Studio CC690 center channel, Bose 201 used as surrounds and an SVS SB13-Ultra subwoofer. Over this system, in 3D and 2D, this movie simply rocked and was a lot of fun to watch.

1313268,A4796VPATRFR1,B002ZG99QS,Eoghann Irving,"[0, 0]","I'm really not sure how well this movie works if Tron isn't a part of your childhood. In its day Tron was something unique. Not necessarily good (plot and characterwise it was ho hum), but something visually distinct. So part of the appeal of this movie for me at least, is recreating that.On on that level (visually and aurally) they absolutely succeed. What we see on the screen here is a logical and satisfying extension of what came before. It's stunning to look at. We still have Light Cycles, but now we also have Light Planes for example. So far so good.But Tron: Legacy also apes the original movie when it comes to plot and character. In fact it is worse. We're talking characters so shallow that two dimensional would be a compliment and a plot that really doesn't make sense if you analyse it at all. I'm not going to even try and make it work. The plot black holes would suck me in.There's not much to be said about the acting either. Garrett Hedlund as Sam Flynn.... is. Olivia Wilde does a decent job of being pretty and a wide eyed innocent (not really an acting challenge) and Bruce Boxleitner doesn't really get anything to work with. The Tron sub-plot is under-used unfortunately.The only standout performance is Michael Sheen in the role of Castor, who milks his minor character for everything it's worth.Somehow though it doesn't matter. There's action, there's discs, there's Light Cycles!  And there's a really creepy Jeff Bridges both as Clu and as the younger Kevin Flynn.Let's talk about that for a moment. The effects work to animate a younger Jeff Bridges has been heavily criticized, but it's actually a pretty impressive technical achievement and it _almost_ works. But it's just slightly off. The face is *too* perfect and too still. For Clu you can go with it. After all he's a computer clone of Flynn. But they shouldn't have used it in the early real world segment.So great spectacle, crappy plot and so-so acting. Where does that leave us? Well I still loved it. Just switch off your brain and surf the wave.

Johnson ""'ntohign slhe thaersam'""","[5, 6]","In a word, yes.Late in my BD collection, but still much loved, TRON: Legacy explodes into light and life, sound and fury. The story starts off almost as a slight segue from the original; we see Flynn (always the marvelous Jeff Bridges) with his son possibly hours prior to getting zapped into the Internet before it was really the Internet.You read that right; the original TRON predates everything except for the vaguest concept of the Internet. If you have not seen it yet, stop reading this review and go watch it. Now.Back? Alrighty. The film then skips 20 years and the son receives a mysterious clue about the whereabouts of his father. Cue special effects. Enter eye candy.The film was beautiful on the big screen, breathtaking in 3D, and even still a powerful experience in 2D HD. The 7.1 soundtrack explodes in your ears, whizzing along and grabbing you for the ride. The quality of the acting is less important than the underscores of the story: is the Creator responsible for the Created, and if so, how do you hold them accountable? Can human existence persist in an artificial environment, and if so how does the concept of The Soul correlate? Can visual effects be used as a primary character in film? And no, I'm not talking about Avatar and other purely CGI films. I'm talking about the visual effects (like some 98% of the film) of the new TRON film acting as a visual construct for the whole of the Internet. Pretty gutsy. And fairly unique. There is literally nothing like TRON and certainly not with the pure spectacle of TRON: Legacy.The BD is rounded out with a goodly handful of featurettes, including a very unique prologue containing what happens directly after the film leaves off. We don't have any Commentary tracks, but then again, both TRON films are intended for the audience to make up their own minds and figure out the meanings therein.The best part is the visuals, hands down. I guarantee, every time you watch this film you will notice something new. Maybe just a small but arresting detail, but it's still there.

The 3D Bluray, 3D Glasses and a 3D TV??!! No thanks.Movie:As for the movie itself, I don't know why some people are having such issues and are giving it low ratings. It is a well made, well acted film. I was impressed with the CG, younger version of Flynn (CLU). They completely rendered a younger version of Jeff Bridges who is the program that Flynn created called CLU while at the same time, Jeff played Flynn (The original creator) as well who has aged 20yrs since the first movie, Tron.Small spoiler: Tron is still running around in this film but they keep his face hidden by a helmet for almost the whole movie. If you pay attention to the Tron action figure in the beginning, you will know Tron is still around in the cyber world.I really enjoyed the 2D Bluray. This is the kind of movie you want to see on Bluray.Special features: I would expect a bit more for souch a big budget film but there was enough that you will have more to watch after the movie is ended.

From there, we see a familiar face in Alan Bradley, but he is given maybe twenty minutes of screen time throughout the whole movie. Sam goes to his father's arcade, enters a code, and is transported to the digital realm. There, without even being taken to a holding cell, he is placed in the 'games', until his identity as a user is discovered by none other than Tron (another actor with a full mask, with a voice over by Bruce Boxleitner). He is then introduced to Clu, who seeks to destroy him via another confrontation, this time on light cycles. As Sam is about to be killed, he is rescued By Quorra, played by Olivia Wilde, his father's 'apprentice'. A father and son reunion ensues, followed by a race to beat Clu to the I/O tower.This movie was made, as another reviewer said, to capitalize on the short attention spans of the younger generation. The characters (with the exception of Jeff Bridges and a very short appearance by Bruce Boxleitner) are the only redeeming things in this movie. The computer circutry has been downplayed in favor of a streamlined, flashy look. Here, instead of a couple of characters joining forces in a common goal, we have the all too common father-son reunion, and the confusion and anger that follows. Hot chicks in latex abound, there are enough strobe lights to give a normal person an epileptic attack, and Tron has been reduced to a character who does nothing but make short appearances.Good visual movie, but there's no way in hell it will stand up to repeated viewings. It just doesn't have anything deeper than sex appeal and flash. No substance.

1313272,A36NMMVWY6BP1V,B002ZG99QS,evani1997,"[0, 0]","Please do not kill me for saying this, but I am not what you would consider a fan of the original TRON. Don't get me wrong, I like the movie. It was a milestone in the special effects department and was quite interesting. However, the film didn't quite stick out to me as it did other people. Of course, being as I grew up in an age where special effects are as advanced as they are today, it shouldn't be too surprising. Despite this, when I saw that a sequel, called TRON: Legacy, was coming out, I wanted to see it. After seeing it, I can now consider myself a TRON fan.Legacy takes place about twenty years after the first one, which is fitting since the film came out about twenty years later. Kevin Flynn (big-time game developer and protagonist of the first film) has gone missing, leaving his son, Sam, to fend for himself. Sam eventually finds the Grid, a digital world his father had created many years ago. Here he finds his dad and faces a new enemy, Clu, who is a digital version of Kevin Flynn. Now Sam, Kevin, and a program called Quorra must now race to the portal if they are ever to escape the Grid. Though there are quite a few twist and turns in the movie, but the story itself is controversial. Many found the plot to be confusing. I personally didn't. Of course, after watching films like Inception, TRON: Legacy shouldn't be that hard to grasp. I did like the story and definitely appreciated that there was one as opposed to it being an action flick with absolutely no story to it. The only thing I really would have changed is that I would have had more Tron in it, being as he's sort of the title character.Though the story is good, what really makes the movie great is its presentation. I would normally say that it is the special effects, for obvious reasons, but I have to be more broad, because the music is just as good. Daft Punk writes and performs the music to this film and their music is brilliant. It's very techno and suits the film perfectly. One of my favorite songs, though, is the Adagio for Tron, which isn't techno at all, but rather orchestrated. In terms of special effects, if you've watched any of the trailers, you know why they're great. Everything in this movie looks very convincing.Overall, I'd say that TRON: Legacy is one of my favorite sci-fi films. Very little is wrong with it, aside from an awkward line of dialogue or two. This film is a worthy successor to the original and, in my opinion, the superior film in the franchise. One thing I have to tell you though is that the 3D isn't very good. This is mostly due to the fact that there aren't actually that many action scenes. If you haven't seen this movie yet, see the first one, and then watch this one. If you've seen the first one, you probably won't be disappointed.Final Score: 9/10",5,True Grid,1396828800,"04 7, 2014",2014,2800,"['Please', 'do', 'not', 'kill', 'saying', 'am', 'not', 'what', 'would', 'consider', 'fan', 'original', 'TRON', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'like', 'movie', 'was', 'milestone', 'special', 'effects', 'department', 'was', 'quite', 'interesting', 'However', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'stick', 'out', 'did', 'other', 'people', 'course', 'being', 'grew', 'up', 'age', 'where', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'as', 'advanced', 'are', 'today', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'surprising', 'when', 'saw', 'sequel', 'called', 'TRON', 'Legacy', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'wanted', 'see', 'seeing', 'can', 'now', 'consider', 'TRON', 'fan.Legacy', 'place', 'twenty', 'years', 'first', 'one', 'fitting', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'Kevin', 'Flynn', 'big-time', 'game', 'developer', 'protagonist', 'first', 'film', 'gone', 'missing', 'leaving', 'son', 'Sam', 'fend', 'Sam', 'eventually', 'Grid', 'digital', 'world', 'father', 'had', 'created', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'Here', 'dad', 'new', 'enemy', 'Clu', 'who', 'digital', 'version', 'Kevin', 'Flynn', 'Now', 'Sam', 'Kevin', 'program', 'called', 'Quorra', 'must', 'now', 'race', 'portal', 'are', 'ever', 'escape', 'Grid', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'twist', 'movie', 'story', 'controversial', 'Many', 'found', 'plot', 'be', 'confusing', 'personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'course', 'watching', 'films', 'Inception', 'TRON', 'Legacy', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'that', 'hard', 'grasp', 'did', 'story', 'definitely', 'appreciated', 'was', 'one', 'opposed', 'being', 'action', 'flick', 'absolutely', 'story', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'changed', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'Tron', 'being', 'sort', 'title', 'story', 'good', 'what', 'really', 'movie', 'great', 'presentation', 'would', 'normally', 'say', 'special', 'effects', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'have', 'be', 'more', 'broad', 'music', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'Daft', 'Punk', 'writes', 'music', 'film', 'music', 'brilliant', 'very', 'techno', 'suits', 'film', 'perfectly', 'One', 'favorite', 'songs', 'Adagio', 'Tron', ""n't"", 'techno', 'rather', 'orchestrated', 'terms', 'special', 'effects', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'trailers', 'know', 'why', ""'re"", 'great', 'Everything', 'movie', 'very', 'convincing.Overall', ""'d"", 'say', 'TRON', 'Legacy', 'one', 'favorite', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'Very', 'little', 'wrong', 'aside', 'awkward', 'line', 'dialogue', 'two', 'film', 'worthy', 'successor', 'original', 'opinion', 'superior', 'film', 'franchise', 'One', 'thing', 'have', 'tell', '3D', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'mostly', 'due', 'fact', 'are', ""n't"", 'actually', 'many', 'action', 'scenes', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'yet', 'see', 'first', 'one', 'then', 'watch', 'one', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'first', 'one', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed.Final', 'Score', '9/10']",N/A

1313277,AY12DBB0U420B,B002ZG99QS,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","This review is from: Tron: Legacy (DVD)Not too long ago, I became interested in the music of Daft Punk and bought and reviewed two of their live albums (1997 and 2007). They were excellent. As such, I was looking over the other available selections and found that the ""Tron Legacy Soundtrack Album"" was coming out. I ordered it well in advance of the release date. It was an excellent soundtrack album but my impression was that the music was more symphonic orchestra than Daft Punk. Nevertheless, it was excellent music and my feeling was that it will undoubtedly gain an academy award nomination as best soundtrack of the year. We'll see. In any case, I was wondering what the music might sound like in a cavernous theater environment so last night my wife and I took in the ""Tron Legacy"" movie.We both enjoyed the movie, but it took us a long time to be won over. Somehow the story seemed implausible and rather thin. Mostly it consisted of rather spectacular action scenes involving martial arts, racing cars, space-age motorcycles, fighting of all kinds, guns of every type and a wide variety of other violence. It was interesting and I'm always left in awe of how they ever manage to make these movies. Really incredible! In any case, the thin plot involving computer, father, son, electronic girlfriend and so forth all involved in a gigantic sci-fi chase scene finally won us over and we'd say that it was an interesting and enjoyable movie. Would I buy the movie to watch again on DVD? Probably not.But remember, I wasn't there primarily for the movie, but rather to hear the Daft Punk soundtrack. Well, it was a bit disappointing. Our theater's sound system was not as good as I expected. Also, the soundtrack CD has only the music, whereas the movie has the music plus a plethora of miscellaneous noises to go along with it. Plus the soundtrack of the movie was quite considerably longer than the soundtrack album on CD. Did I enjoy it? Yes. It was excellent, but my feeling is that the CD is better for the music part alone.

1313278,A1EQQ5XM756RTQ,B002ZG99QS,G D Bryant,"[0, 0]","It's one of those funny myths of Hollywood.  The myth that the original Tron was a total failure and people didn't really get it.Well, that's half true.  People didn't really get it at all.  However, the part about it being a total failure wasn't true.  It grossed about $70 million with a cost of $17 million.  That was with very stiff competition like E.T. and others.  I think the fact that it didn't reach $100 million made someone at Disney float the rumor that it was some sort of bomb.Therefore, no sequel was forthcoming.  Perhaps ever.But over the better part of 30 years, it has become a classic.  And people have been wanting a sequel for a very long time.  In late 2010, they got their wish:  Tron Legacy.The film takes place in modern times, 27 years after the original.  Kevin Flynn (played in the original and in Legacy by Jeff Bridges) had the key to the next step in human evolution.  But, in 1989, before he can tell anyone the details, he mysteriously disappears, leaving behind a son with no mother or father.Flash forward to now.  That son, Sam Flynn, is a major shareholder in Encom, his dad's company, but seems to have little interest in being an executive.  He does love making the other execs nervous by committing a series of practical jokes at the company's expense, such as sabotaging Encom's new operating system by releasing it online for free before it can be put online for sale.But a mysterious page from Flynn's Arcade, closed for 20 years, indicates that his father is alive and well.  And Sam must find out what happened.The critics have been generally very lukewarm about this film.  My take is that it is a film that tries to straddle the fine line between kids fare and adults fare, with mixed results.  There's no denying that the special effects are pretty awesome and it captures the spirit of the original very well, albeit with a modern sensibility.  But, sometimes the performances by the cast, with some exceptions, are a little wooden and could use a bit more of a sense of humor.  They take it a bit too seriously.I think Jeff Bridges provides most of the humor and wit, Flynn being a bit of a ideological hippy, but he kind of overdoes it.  He does provide a great bad guy in his other role as Clu, the power hungry computer alter ego of Flynn's.Garrett Hedlund, who plays Sam, has the tendency to grunt and mumble his lines.  He's likable enough, but his enunciation skills could use some work.  He tries to talk like Clint Eastwood and it doesn't really work for him.Olivia Wilde, who plays Quorra, the video game warrior with a potentially world changing secret, is nice and she has the physicality to do the role, but even she is a bit plastic.  However, she has the ability and talent to improve in future movies.The highlight is Zeus, played by Michael Sheen, who provides the animated camp of David Bowie and Tim Curry.  But his screen time is rather short.  However, judging from his interviews, he didn't seem to mind that much.  He's been a fan of the original since he was a kid and loved being on the same set with Jeff Bridges.The Blu-Ray is awesome, as usual, with a 7.1 mix and razor sharp picture.  The switching between aspect ratios during the film is something new to me and I question its necessity, but it doesn't affect the quality of the disk.  And I do love the short film Flynn Lives (an epilogue, if you will), marking the return of a fan favorite from the first film (although he's not in Legacy).My verdict:  It's a promising re-launch and I look forward to future movies that can build upon this one and do a better job.End of line.",4,Continuation of line,1388275200,"12 29, 2013",2013,3611,"['one', 'funny', 'myths', 'Hollywood', 'myth', 'original', 'Tron', 'was', 'total', 'failure', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'it.Well', 'true', 'People', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'However', 'part', 'being', 'total', 'failure', 'was', ""n't"", 'true', 'grossed', '70', 'million', 'cost', '17', 'million', 'was', 'very', 'stiff', 'competition', 'E.T', 'others', 'think', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'reach', '100', 'million', 'made', 'someone', 'Disney', 'float', 'rumor', 'was', 'sort', 'bomb.Therefore', 'sequel', 'was', 'forthcoming', 'Perhaps', 'better', 'part', '30', 'years', 'become', 'classic', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'wanting', 'sequel', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'late', '2010', 'got', 'wish', 'Tron', 'Legacy.The', 'film', 'place', 'modern', 'times', '27', 'years', 'original', 'Kevin', 'Flynn', 'played', 'original', 'Legacy', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'had', 'key', 'next', 'step', 'human', 'evolution', '1989', 'can', 'tell', 'anyone', 'details', 'mysteriously', 'leaving', 'son', 'mother', 'father.Flash', 'forward', 'now', 'son', 'Sam', 'Flynn', 'major', 'shareholder', 'Encom', 'dad', 'company', 'have', 'little', 'interest', 'being', 'executive', 'love', 'making', 'other', 'execs', 'nervous', 'committing', 'series', 'practical', 'jokes', 'company', 'expense', 'such', 'sabotaging', 'Encom', 'new', 'operating', 'system', 'releasing', 'online', 'free', 'can', 'be', 'put', 'online', 'sale.But', 'mysterious', 'page', 'Flynn', 'Arcade', 'closed', '20', 'years', 'father', 'alive', 'well', 'Sam', 'must', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened.The', 'critics', 'have', 'been', 'generally', 'very', 'lukewarm', 'film', 'take', 'film', 'straddle', 'fine', 'line', 'kids', 'fare', 'adults', 'fare', 'mixed', 'results', 'denying', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'awesome', 'spirit', 'original', 'very', 'well', 'modern', 'sensibility', 'sometimes', 'performances', 'cast', 'exceptions', 'are', 'little', 'wooden', 'could', 'use', 'bit', 'more', 'sense', 'humor', 'take', 'bit', 'too', 'seriously.I', 'think', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'most', 'humor', 'wit', 'Flynn', 'being', 'bit', 'ideological', 'hippy', 'kind', 'overdoes', 'provide', 'great', 'bad', 'guy', 'other', 'role', 'Clu', 'power', 'hungry', 'computer', 'alter', 'ego', ""Flynn's.Garrett"", 'Hedlund', 'who', 'Sam', 'tendency', 'grunt', 'mumble', 'lines', 'likable', 'enough', 'enunciation', 'skills', 'could', 'use', 'work', 'talk', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'him.Olivia', 'Wilde', 'who', 'Quorra', 'video', 'game', 'warrior', 'potentially', 'world', 'changing', 'secret', 'nice', 'physicality', 'do', 'role', 'even', 'bit', 'plastic', 'However', 'ability', 'talent', 'improve', 'future', 'movies.The', 'highlight', 'Zeus', 'played', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'who', 'animated', 'camp', 'David', 'Bowie', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'screen', 'time', 'rather', 'short', 'However', 'judging', 'interviews', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'mind', 'much', 'been', 'fan', 'original', 'was', 'kid', 'loved', 'being', 'same', 'set', 'Jeff', 'Bridges.The', 'Blu-Ray', 'awesome', 'usual', '7.1', 'mix', 'razor', 'sharp', 'picture', 'switching', 'aspect', 'ratios', 'film', 'something', 'new', 'question', 'necessity', ""n't"", 'affect', 'quality', 'disk', 'do', 'love', 'short', 'film', 'Flynn', 'Lives', 'epilogue', 'will', 'marking', 'return', 'fan', 'favorite', 'first', 'film', 'not', 'Legacy', 'verdict', 'promising', 're-launch', 'look', 'forward', 'future', 'movies', 'can', 'build', 'one', 'do', 'better', 'job.End', 'line']",N/A

In the same way that God created man in his own image and likeness... Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) creates Clu in his own image and likeness. The objective was for Clu to help him to perfect the digital Grid that he made. However, Clu, like man in his own curiosity, rebels against his creator. Here is where the story diverges, in that Clu turns Flynn into a captive of the Grid.Plot:Sam Flynn (Garret Hedlund) loses his father at 12 years of age. Now as a young adult, he is a bit deviant. One day a strange text is received by his surrogate father, Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner, who also acts as Tron) on his pager. The message is from Kevin's office, where the line has been disconnected years ago. Based on this message, Sam goes to their old arcade center, where he is then absorbed into the Grid.Cinematics:This movie is a digital graphics wonder. The artistic designs are simply breath taking to behold. At times, its hard to believe that all the visuals are mainly computer generated images.The activities include: an updated versions of the disc game and the light cycle game. Omitted are the tanks and the cone games. The vehicle initiations are excellent, a baton like object is thrown and as the user grabs it, the entire vehicle is quickly rendered out. Simply impressive.Conclusion:This film is a must see for all techies and Sci-fi fans, While the plot is not a mind bender, the action sequences are very engaging. Also there is some emotional depth contained in this film.

1313287,A1X15AQVSCKKRG,B002ZG99QS,GreatMovieCriticForever,"[4, 8]","Very decent sequel to the original Tron. I got goose bumps when I watched this in the theater.  It's been a long time coming but finally a sequel was done.Tron Legacy is a visually sound movie experience.  The 200 million dollar budget over the movie definitely shows on screen.  The incredible musical score by Daft Punk fits the film PERFECTLY and it definitely felt like this was taken right after the original TRON.Story: Kevin Flynn, the hero from the original movie, took over Encom but then mysteriously vanished. Sam's gets an s.o. s from Flynn's old arcade house. He gets there then he gets thrown back into the digital world of Tron (just like Flynn did in the original movie). Sam has to fight in the games of the grid like his father did all the while trying to get to his father, so the two can find a way out of the grid. Kevin it turns out was betrayed by his program, Clu, who has decided to take over the whole grid killing any programs and anomalies that threaten him.I read a couple of the critiques about the film with regards to the story, and the critics do have some valid points. The story told is pretty simple, and could have been reworked a bit more to  take full advantage of all the elements from the original movie including the actual character of Tron/ Alan Bradley  (Bruce Boxleitner) whose inexplicably reduced to a minor role....However, with that said, the writers didn't lose sight of the main character of Kevin Flynn who was the main character of the original movie. Jeff Bridges hasn't played the role in more than twenty eight years, but as the great actor he is, easily starts out where he left in the original and takes the character into another direction. Kevin Flynn is now older and as such is a wiser,  darker,  more mysterious character, not the same nave guy he was in the first movie.Joseph Kosinki's directorial style is good. He throws a lot of references to the original movie and uses a couple of comedy bits, but the movie for the most part has a dark and futuristic look that gives fans a good feel of where exactly the Tron universe has evolved too since the last movie.The movie  is definitely a visual spectacle for the eyes. Everything has been upgraded from the original, and you definitely do get the realism like the original that this guy has been sucked into the movie. The light cycles have been upgraded, and you see programs disassembled and destroyed In more graphic fashion than in the original movie. We also get the cool hand to hand disc battles that were in the original with the exception now that the fights borrow a lot from motion style of fighting. There are added new gadgets like the light jets and light cars.There's also besides the visual feats as mentioned an incredible music score by French musicians Daft Punk (who have a small cameo in the movie as a couple of digital Dj's). Daft Punk's score is definitely another element that really made the movie quite an experience.The performances in the movie are good.  As talked about Jeff Bridges as Kevin Flynn has grown from the original movie. He's no longer the that nave hacker with a love for computers, now he's older and seen his great creation once again perverted again.  Garrett Hedlund as Sam Flynn does his role well as the estranged son here. Olivia Wilde as his would be love interest is also pretty good.Tron Legacy is a good sequel that definitely lives up the hype surrounding it. Studios gave the director a mighty big budget to work with, and he took advantage of it. It's true the script and story could have been better but as far as what happens to the main character of Kevin Flynn, they did answer a lot of questions that we wanted to know since the first movie and introduced a couple of new ones for possible sequels. If there are plans for further entries in the franchise then they must include a deeper story that takes more advantage of the characters from the original including Tron.  As far as this movie goes,  I think they got right what they were supposed to do which is get news fans interested in the franchise, and get older dedicated fans of  the original something to look back on.",4,Good sequel,1292803200,"12 20, 2010",2010,4157,"['Very', 'decent', 'sequel', 'original', 'Tron', 'got', 'goose', 'bumps', 'when', 'watched', 'theater', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'coming', 'finally', 'sequel', 'was', 'done.Tron', 'Legacy', 'visually', 'sound', 'movie', 'experience', '200', 'million', 'dollar', 'budget', 'movie', 'definitely', 'screen', 'incredible', 'musical', 'score', 'Daft', 'Punk', 'film', 'PERFECTLY', 'definitely', 'felt', 'was', 'taken', 'right', 'original', 'TRON.Story', 'Kevin', 'Flynn', 'hero', 'original', 'movie', 'took', 'over', 'Encom', 'then', 'mysteriously', 'vanished', 'Sam', 's.o', 's', 'Flynn', 'old', 'arcade', 'house', 'there', 'then', 'thrown', 'back', 'digital', 'world', 'Tron', 'just', 'Flynn', 'did', 'original', 'movie', 'Sam', 'fight', 'games', 'grid', 'father', 'did', 'while', 'trying', 'get', 'father', 'two', 'can', 'find', 'way', 'grid', 'Kevin', 'out', 'was', 'betrayed', 'program', 'Clu', 'who', 'decided', 'take', 'over', 'whole', 'grid', 'killing', 'programs', 'anomalies', 'threaten', 'him.I', 'read', 'couple', 'critiques', 'film', 'regards', 'story', 'critics', 'do', 'have', 'valid', 'points', 'story', 'told', 'pretty', 'simple', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'reworked', 'bit', 'more', 'take', 'full', 'advantage', 'elements', 'original', 'movie', 'including', 'actual', 'character', 'Tron/', 'Alan', 'Bradley', 'Bruce', 'Boxleitner', 'inexplicably', 'reduced', 'minor', 'role', '.However', 'said', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'lose', 'sight', 'main', 'character', 'Kevin', 'Flynn', 'who', 'was', 'main', 'character', 'original', 'movie', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', ""n't"", 'played', 'role', 'more', 'twenty', 'eight', 'years', 'great', 'actor', 'easily', 'out', 'where', 'left', 'original', 'character', 'direction', 'Kevin', 'Flynn', 'now', 'older', 'such', 'wiser', 'darker', 'more', 'mysterious', 'character', 'not', 'same', 'nave', 'guy', 'was', 'first', 'movie.Joseph', 'Kosinki', 'directorial', 'style', 'good', 'lot', 'references', 'original', 'movie', 'couple', 'comedy', 'bits', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'dark', 'futuristic', 'look', 'fans', 'good', 'feel', 'where', 'exactly', 'Tron', 'universe', 'evolved', 'too', 'last', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'definitely', 'visual', 'spectacle', 'eyes', 'Everything', 'been', 'upgraded', 'original', 'definitely', 'do', 'get', 'realism', 'original', 'guy', 'been', 'sucked', 'movie', 'light', 'cycles', 'have', 'been', 'upgraded', 'see', 'programs', 'disassembled', 'destroyed', 'more', 'graphic', 'fashion', 'original', 'movie', 'also', 'get', 'cool', 'hand', 'hand', 'disc', 'battles', 'were', 'original', 'exception', 'now', 'fights', 'borrow', 'lot', 'motion', 'style', 'fighting', 'are', 'added', 'new', 'gadgets', 'light', 'jets', 'light', 'cars.There', 'also', 'visual', 'feats', 'mentioned', 'incredible', 'music', 'score', 'French', 'musicians', 'Daft', 'Punk', 'who', 'have', 'small', 'cameo', 'movie', 'couple', 'digital', 'Dj', 'Daft', 'Punk', 'score', 'definitely', 'element', 'really', 'made', 'movie', 'quite', 'experience.The', 'performances', 'movie', 'are', 'good', 'talked', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Kevin', 'Flynn', 'grown', 'original', 'movie', 'no', 'longer', 'nave', 'hacker', 'love', 'computers', 'now', 'older', 'seen', 'great', 'creation', 'once', 'again', 'perverted', 'again', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'Sam', 'Flynn', 'role', 'well', 'estranged', 'son', 'here', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'would', 'be', 'love', 'interest', 'also', 'pretty', 'good.Tron', 'Legacy', 'good', 'sequel', 'definitely', 'up', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'Studios', 'gave', 'director', 'mighty', 'big', 'budget', 'work', 'took', 'advantage', 'true', 'script', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'as', 'far', 'what', 'main', 'character', 'Kevin', 'Flynn', 'did', 'answer', 'lot', 'questions', 'wanted', 'know', 'first', 'movie', 'introduced', 'couple', 'new', 'ones', 'possible', 'sequels', 'are', 'plans', 'further', 'entries', 'franchise', 'then', 'must', 'include', 'deeper', 'story', 'more', 'advantage', 'characters', 'original', 'including', 'Tron', 'As', 'far', 'movie', 'think', 'got', 'right', 'what', 'were', 'supposed', 'do', 'get', 'news', 'fans', 'interested', 'franchise', 'get', 'older', 'dedicated', 'fans', 'original', 'something', 'look', 'back']",N/A

1313290,A2HD1FY51FM1TW,B002ZG99QS,Grimluke,"[0, 0]","Being a fan of the original TRON film, I was hyped to find out that they were making a sequel. I saw this epic sequel opening day and I must say that it was completely worth it! Here is my breakdown of the film:Story: Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges), the protagonist of the original film, disappeared a few years after the events of the first movie. Present day, his son Sam (Garrett Hedlund) has become a reckless young adult, unaware of what truly happened to his dad. His investigation leads him to an old laser that shoots him into the digital world known as the Grid. The plot is good, but I think the first film had a better one. The story can drag a bit, but there are some plot points that I found interesting.Acting: For the most part, the acting is okay, but actors like Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxlitener (Alan Bradley) are GREAT at their jobs.Writing: The writing is really good, excluding an awkward line or two.Special Effects: The clear highlight of this film is the special effects. The world looks absolutely amazing, and the action scenes are some of the best I've seen in any movie. I am still perplexed as to how this movie wasn't nominated for best special effects at the Academy Awards. They are INCREDIBLE!!!Music: Another one of the best parts of this movie. Daft Punk did a great job making awesome tecno music to match this epic science fiction film.Costumes: Again, why weren't these nominated at the Oscars?Verdict: All in all, this is great sequel.

Like many of its kind, Tron Legacy can feel less impressive next to the original, but that doesn't mean it's a bad film in its own right.Visually, Legacy channels much of the spirit of the original film with fantastic updated designs to the landscape, sets, and vehicles present in the film. However, certain other elements have been streamlined, mostly notably the costumes. Whereas in the first film programs would often be seen wearing rather bizarre costumes that formed odd shapes and unique silhouettes filled with complex, circuit-board like design patterns. In this film, everybody wears the same generic body suit with a few conservative light patterns. The handful of characters you see that look different, have a more generic cyber-punk look to them such as loose clothing with basic trim patterns. Often when you see the actors interacting with each other, it looks more like a new matrix movie or a lost star wars episode then Tron.Story wise while the original film was a wide-arc adventure focusing on the discovery of this new fantasy world. The new film is instead a character-driven story about Sam Flynn, the son of Kevin Flynn from the first film. Pretty much the entire film is told from his perspective, with plenty of drama, romance, and action. As a character development piece it is pretty good, but it missed out on a great deal of potential. `The Grid' is portrayed more as just another alternate dimension rather then being a world inside our computer software, as all the ties that related it to real electronics are gone. Aside from the occasional reference to users and programs, there's no more bits, no more data streams, the internet is never even mentioned. I was personally hoping to see how the new world created in Tron would've evolved over the years, as technology has evolved so far and so fast. Instead we got the story of Sam Flynn. Again, they could've removed the few references to the world established in the first Tron and called it a new Matrix film, and you wouldn't know the difference.On the other hand, the action sequences in this film are fantastic. The creative team took full advantage of the advanced technology available today and the deep pockets that Disney has. Deadly Discs is given a multiplayer tournament setup, the light bikes race across multiple levels, and the aerial battle at the end is just fantastic!As far as the extras on this blue ray package, they are all well worth it. Tron Legacy is available in a large number of packages, and I'd strongly advise consumers to take the time to compare and contrast before making their final decision. Do you really need three versions of this film? One on DVD, one on Blue Ray, and on for 3D? Sounds pretty wasteful. And don't even think about the four or five disk sets, that just insane. Save yourself the cash and pick this up on a cheaper set like this one.

1313297,A2ICW5OUWX2A2V,B002ZG99QS,Ian,"[5, 11]","Before I review Tron:  Legacy, I feel I should point out that I have little emotional connection to the original Tron film, a movie which I thought had a very unique idea, but was at the same time an average film that had a nifty visual style, but a plot that felt muddled with no real goal or purpose, and was mostly a showcase for the film's look.  Now, almost thirty years later, Tron has finally gotten a sequel that delivers pretty much more of the same, but adds an interesting dimension to this digital universe.Tron:  Legacy begins back in 1989.  Kevin Flynn, now a rich and wildly successful CEO of ENCOM International, talks with his son, Sam, about the Tron universe.  But like almost all happy families in films, things fall apart.  Kevin vanishes, and Sam grows up an unhappy, fatherless kid.  But one day, Kevin sends a page, and Sam heads to the old arcade his father frequented, and soon finds himself inside the Tron world, and finds himself involved in a plot that could introduce both worlds to each other...with disastrous consequences.At first glance, Tron delivers a mixed experience...the visuals, as to be expected, are incredible, full of sleek, shiny, yet dark technology that has fused to create a world of haunting, electronic beauty, full of dazzling black and neon that feels artificial, yet real at the same time, as if this place really exists in a world different from our own.  Yet, on the story level, Tron:  Legacy feels as muddled as it's predecessor.  The visuals and the world itself take the spotlight, and the script feels somewhat aimless, moving along without a greater theme or meaning (There is a subplot about life that spontaneously appears and could change humanity's perception on everything, but it doesn't really go anywhere), and when it's over, it feels somewhat empty.However, there is an unexpected surprise within the story...while Sam and Quorra are supposed to be the main characters, it's Kevin and Clu who steal the spotlight, as they share an almost religious relationship, with Kevin being God, and Clu being the devil, who started out good, but eventually sought to rule the Tron world.  The relationship between the two is fascinating and compelling to watch, and I really wish the movie had focused completely on the two of them, and the idea that the God of the Tron world has lost control of his creation, and now has to deal with the consequences.In the end, Tron: Legacy is a fun sequel.  Despite the weak story, it's fantastic visuals, fascinating relationship between Kevin and CLU (who is really a digitally de-aged Jeff Bridges, an effect pulled off very well), and great action moments help to make it a fun experience worth seeing.  It doesn't hit masterpiece status, but it gets pretty close, and in that aspect, it's a worthy successor to the original.",3,"A great graphical upgrade, but not much else",1292544000,"12 17, 2010",2010,2829,"['review', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'feel', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'have', 'little', 'emotional', 'connection', 'original', 'Tron', 'film', 'movie', 'thought', 'had', 'very', 'unique', 'idea', 'was', 'same', 'time', 'average', 'film', 'had', 'nifty', 'visual', 'style', 'plot', 'felt', 'muddled', 'real', 'goal', 'purpose', 'was', 'mostly', 'showcase', 'film', 'look', 'Now', 'almost', 'thirty', 'years', 'later', 'Tron', 'finally', 'gotten', 'sequel', 'pretty', 'much', 'more', 'same', 'interesting', 'dimension', 'digital', 'universe.Tron', 'Legacy', 'back', '1989', 'Kevin', 'Flynn', 'now', 'rich', 'wildly', 'successful', 'CEO', 'ENCOM', 'International', 'son', 'Sam', 'Tron', 'universe', 'almost', 'happy', 'families', 'films', 'things', 'fall', 'apart', 'Kevin', 'vanishes', 'Sam', 'up', 'unhappy', 'fatherless', 'kid', 'one', 'day', 'Kevin', 'page', 'Sam', 'heads', 'old', 'arcade', 'father', 'frequented', 'soon', 'Tron', 'world', 'involved', 'plot', 'could', 'introduce', 'worlds', 'other', 'disastrous', 'consequences.At', 'first', 'glance', 'Tron', 'mixed', 'experience', 'visuals', 'be', 'expected', 'are', 'incredible', 'full', 'sleek', 'shiny', 'yet', 'dark', 'technology', 'fused', 'create', 'world', 'haunting', 'electronic', 'beauty', 'full', 'dazzling', 'black', 'neon', 'artificial', 'yet', 'real', 'same', 'time', 'place', 'really', 'world', 'different', 'own', 'story', 'level', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'feels', 'as', 'muddled', 'predecessor', 'visuals', 'world', 'take', 'spotlight', 'script', 'somewhat', 'aimless', 'moving', 'along', 'greater', 'theme', 'meaning', 'subplot', 'life', 'spontaneously', 'could', 'change', 'humanity', 'perception', 'everything', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'anywhere', 'when', 'somewhat', 'empty.However', 'unexpected', 'surprise', 'story', 'Sam', 'Quorra', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'main', 'characters', 'Kevin', 'Clu', 'who', 'steal', 'spotlight', 'share', 'almost', 'religious', 'relationship', 'Kevin', 'being', 'God', 'Clu', 'being', 'devil', 'who', 'started', 'out', 'good', 'eventually', 'sought', 'rule', 'Tron', 'world', 'relationship', 'two', 'fascinating', 'compelling', 'watch', 'really', 'wish', 'movie', 'had', 'focused', 'completely', 'two', 'idea', 'God', 'Tron', 'world', 'lost', 'control', 'creation', 'now', 'deal', 'consequences.In', 'end', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'fun', 'sequel', 'weak', 'story', 'fantastic', 'visuals', 'fascinating', 'relationship', 'Kevin', 'CLU', 'who', 'really', 'digitally', 'de-aged', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'effect', 'pulled', 'off', 'very', 'well', 'great', 'action', 'moments', 'help', 'make', 'fun', 'experience', 'worth', 'seeing', ""n't"", 'hit', 'masterpiece', 'status', 'pretty', 'close', 'aspect', 'worthy', 'successor', 'original']",N/A

1313299,A1Y0HX12MCT6OR,B002ZG99QS,I'm Right,"[1, 6]","I am the least qualified person to review this movie, I've never seen the original, I was basically dragged into this with no interest, and I didn't even watch the whole thing! So you'd probably be saving some time just hitting the 'no' button now and moving on.Anywhoo Tron: Legacy continues the apparent legacy of the man who created an alternate reality is passed on to his son, who is like some mega-genius hacker who's living like a slob off his dad's company. I enjoyed this part quite a bit though, the company has a boring meeting when the son messes with them and runs away from the police, the whole presentation was very Disney adventure like.When the kid gets into the alternate reality at first it was kinda cool, he was being transported in some 1984 world where programs are forced to fight each other I guess to please the dad's clone. After awhile though what should've been dramatic movie action turned into one long video game, and in between the action scenes the dialogue/story were too basic to really delve into the realm of sci-fi, and too much of a mish mash of CGI with almost no human elements, and when those elements come on it's a vapid experience. Everything except Olivia Wilde's smokin' body that is.It starts to really drag on at the point where the son met his real father so my friend decided to skip to the last scene where the characters were trying to escape in some timed portal. After the movie I had no questions, there were no apparent plot holes, the whole story made sense without watching the second act in the movie. This is the only movie I've seen that seemingly had a completely unnecessary middle part.Daft Punk did the soundtrack, I've never really given their music a fair chance but it seems like bland techno for people who usually don't like techno, and the soundtrack in this film from what I've heard were very simple dumb 'thump thump thump' sounds.

This Blu-ray contains the 2D BD, 3D BD, DVD, & Digital Copy, along with Disney Movie Rewards points. The video quality is amazing and I never noticed anything I didn't like. The IMAX scenes are included so it goes from widescreen to IMAX a few times, but it isn't really noticeable. The audio is great and the soundtrack to the movie is the best I have ever heard. The only thing I was disappointed about was the special features. There are only a few and they aren't that good. Flynn Lives was disappointing, but would probably be better for people that are big fans of the original. Installing the Cast just talked briefly on five actors. First Look at Tron: Uprising was just like a scene from the new show. It does look good, but it doesn't really tell you anything about the show. Visualizing Tron takes you behind the scenes of the movie, but I wish it was longer.  Launching the Legacy was a behind the scenes look at how this film came to be. This was probably the most interesting feature on the disc. Disc Roars was just the audience at Comic Con making noise that was used in the film which was pretty useless. There is also a music video and short trailers for Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides and more. There is also a feature called Second Screen that can be used on your computer or iPad that lets you look at behind the scenes stuff while the movie is playing. There is no BD Live so there won't be any added features in the future.

1313302,A12VPEOEZS1KTC,B002ZG99QS,JadeRain,"[0, 3]","Greetings, well let me say that I was and still am a fan of the original Tron film.  Yes, I've taken my share of abuse for this over the years.  I really dug the Discs of Tron arcade game that you could stand in, and I even enjoyed the Intellivsion game Discs of Tron.  So, I was somewhat excited when I heard that there would be a new Tron film.  Wished I could have seen it at the IMAX, but I liked it.  I think they really couldn't have done a much better job.  That is saying a lot in my opinion, considering the drivel they turn out these days.  Yes, I suppose one could say that Tron has the same out-of-control action that other films do, but I still enjoyed it.  I really like that they dropped Jules Verne's name, and Flynn's living quarters are right out of one of Verne's books, maybe the youngsters will look up some of his works.  Nitpicks?  The ""rebel leader"" guy was too much like something out of the Matrix, and I still think they could slow the action down and it would be MORE intense, not less.  Just my opinion.

1313303,A20TZ1MQ0KMJRR,B002ZG99QS,Jaha,"[1, 3]","I am one of the few die hard Tron fans who apparently enjoyed Legacy in the theater.  I have seen the original probably 100 times since the 80's.  Heck the video store ended up giving me the VHS one day saying that I must have purchased it several times over we rented it so much.I expected nothing from Legacy and was surprised.  I caught it in IMAX 3-D and while I could care less for 3D films I loved the IMAX.  The original film wowed audiences with a style and sound never heard before.  Well, Legacy managed the same effect.  The style was amazing and Daft Punk's score is brilliant.  The IMAX experience was over the top and more than made up for the atrocious plot.Sadly, the film doesn't live up to the hype on marginal home theater systems.  Don't get me wrong it;s good.  I have a 42 inch 1080p HDTV with a meager surround sound system.  The film looks beautiful but it lacks that real in your face wow factor.  Because of that I found myself really focusing on the plot more.The original was no Oscar worthy story to be fair.  It was pretty ludicrous but Legacy really went further with some of the ridiculous elements as well as just some gaping holes.  This is Disney after all and they generally aren't known for tight stories, just stunning animation.  The biggest problem in the film I think is that the director is a professional architect.  What happens is the guy spent so much time focusing on set design that the world of Tron ends up being the principle character.  The actual actors are nothing but a vehicle to move you around from one impressive set piece to another.  Successful directors tend not to let their production elements dominate the story.Acting wise the film is ok I suppose.  Jeff Bridges is a great actor but I suspect that the CGI for his CLU character distracts you from his performance and his Kevin character is a bit too much Big Lebowski meets Obi Wan Konobi this time around.  (Granted the plot is a heavily borrowing from Star Wars)  The two youngsters in the film were passable largely because their roles were more physical than emotional.  Basically if they could move they were pushing the film.  I garner that both will gain sex symbol status from their respective fan clubs but to the older crowds they are pretty forgettable.One major gripe I tend to have is that there was very little attempts by the Director/writers to incorporate Tron/Rinzler in to the story more.  Frankly we rarely see Tron and even when he is on screen you don't even realize it.  Kind of silly.Overall I think Tron Legacy was a major visual and auditory success which will forever be plagued by a lousy story.  It's a fun mindless film to throw on once in a while but much of its appeal will be lost from it's translation from the theater to your TV.  Had the director not been so set oriented maybe he could have tightened up the script but alas, it's Disney...  Traditionalists will despise this, casual or new fans will find it enjoyable.  I suspect the films soundtrack will outlive the popularity of the film.",3,Better in the theater...,1303344000,"04 21, 2011",2011,3045,"['am', 'one', 'few', 'die', 'hard', 'Tron', 'fans', 'who', 'apparently', 'enjoyed', 'Legacy', 'theater', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'probably', '100', 'times', '80', 'Heck', 'video', 'store', 'ended', 'up', 'giving', 'VHS', 'one', 'day', 'saying', 'must', 'have', 'purchased', 'several', 'times', 'rented', 'so', 'much.I', 'expected', 'nothing', 'Legacy', 'was', 'surprised', 'caught', 'IMAX', '3-D', 'could', 'care', 'less', '3D', 'films', 'loved', 'IMAX', 'original', 'film', 'wowed', 'audiences', 'style', 'sound', 'never', 'heard', 'Well', 'Legacy', 'managed', 'same', 'effect', 'style', 'was', 'amazing', 'Daft', 'Punk', 'score', 'brilliant', 'IMAX', 'experience', 'was', 'top', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'atrocious', 'plot.Sadly', 'film', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'marginal', 'home', 'theater', 'systems', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 's', 'good', 'have', '42', 'inch', '1080p', 'HDTV', 'meager', 'surround', 'sound', 'system', 'film', 'beautiful', 'real', 'face', 'wow', 'factor', 'found', 'really', 'focusing', 'plot', 'more.The', 'original', 'was', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'story', 'be', 'fair', 'was', 'pretty', 'ludicrous', 'Legacy', 'really', 'went', 'further', 'ridiculous', 'elements', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'gaping', 'holes', 'Disney', 'generally', 'are', ""n't"", 'known', 'tight', 'stories', 'just', 'stunning', 'animation', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'think', 'director', 'professional', 'architect', 'What', 'guy', 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'focusing', 'set', 'design', 'world', 'Tron', 'up', 'being', 'principle', 'character', 'actual', 'actors', 'are', 'nothing', 'vehicle', 'move', 'one', 'impressive', 'set', 'piece', 'Successful', 'directors', 'tend', 'not', 'let', 'production', 'elements', 'dominate', 'story.Acting', 'wise', 'film', 'ok', 'suppose', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'great', 'actor', 'suspect', 'CGI', 'CLU', 'character', 'distracts', 'performance', 'Kevin', 'character', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'Big', 'Lebowski', 'Obi', 'Wan', 'Konobi', 'time', 'around', 'Granted', 'plot', 'heavily', 'borrowing', 'Star', 'Wars', 'two', 'youngsters', 'film', 'were', 'passable', 'largely', 'roles', 'were', 'more', 'physical', 'emotional', 'Basically', 'could', 'move', 'were', 'pushing', 'film', 'garner', 'will', 'gain', 'sex', 'symbol', 'status', 'respective', 'fan', 'clubs', 'older', 'crowds', 'are', 'pretty', 'forgettable.One', 'major', 'gripe', 'tend', 'have', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'attempts', 'Director/writers', 'incorporate', 'Tron/Rinzler', 'story', 'more', 'Frankly', 'rarely', 'see', 'Tron', 'even', 'when', 'screen', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'realize', 'Kind', 'silly.Overall', 'think', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'was', 'major', 'visual', 'auditory', 'success', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'plagued', 'lousy', 'story', 'fun', 'mindless', 'film', 'throw', 'once', 'while', 'much', 'appeal', 'will', 'be', 'lost', 'translation', 'theater', 'TV', 'Had', 'director', 'not', 'been', 'so', 'set', 'oriented', 'maybe', 'could', 'have', 'tightened', 'up', 'script', 'alas', 'Disney', 'Traditionalists', 'will', 'despise', 'casual', 'new', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'enjoyable', 'suspect', 'films', 'soundtrack', 'will', 'outlive', 'popularity', 'film']",N/A

1313308,A1FSLE0YF3BKVQ,B002ZG99QS,Jeannie Tran,"[7, 38]","I feel I should preface this review by saying that I have never seen the original Tron, and I have no computer or gaming prowess whatsoever. See how simple this blog is? Well it took me a LONG time to figure out how to do this, and I'm still trying to learn how to make the pictures line up properly or be the same size. So it shouldn't be surprising that I didn't understand most of what's going on in this movie, and I generally don't like things that I don't understand.I can see why people like Legacy, though, especially since I live in Silicon Valley and am constantly surrounded by techies. But I think a good movie should be able to reach beyond its niche market and appeal to a more general audience. And I know that this is a sequel, but it's been two decades and I know I'm not the only one who hasn't seen Tron. Yes, it definitely should pay homage to the original and its fans, but it should also be able to stand on its own for the new viewers. Some scenes between Flynn and Sam were touching and heartfelt, which was nice, and the actor playing Sam managed to squeeze out some pretty convincing tears. Other than that, I was basically just looking at bright lights for two hours.Ugh, the lights. I get that contrast is effective, but the constant switch between a luminous scene and then a dim scene left me really disorientated. And really, how stealthy can you be when you're a walking Lite Brite? How Clu couldn't see the white light streaking amidst his orange lighted minions is beyond me.The Grid is nothing like what I imagine is inside my computer. It's just a weird futuristic world full of neon lights. If they didn't repeatedly say ""programs,"" ""users,"" or ""discs"" I would totally forget that we're supposed to be inside a computer. Sam's adventure to and within The Grid don't have any sense of a journey to it. He goes to the arcade, tries to play Tron, notices a groove on the floor, finds a door behind the machine, fiddles with a computer, a laser takes him to The Grid instantaneously, wins battles against other programs in seconds, finds his dad, runs to the portal. The end. And while I can accept that his highly adept computer skills were inherited, there's nothing to suggest that he would be a good fighter. There was no struggle or hardship in his battles; he bested his opponents far too quickly and easily, which made it hard to root for him since you knew he was capable of taking care of himself and makes the movie less exciting because you assume he's going to be able to reach his destination.

1313311,A1RSXP7MB772E3,B002ZG99QS,"Jeff W. Shimkus ""Movie Manji""","[2, 5]","Tron Legacy was filmed with great effect. The cybernetic music helped to spin the intricate computer world. Here, Joseph Kosinski, who did commercials before filming the latest Tron, paid some attention in making this Tron with some similarity to the original. This time around it is much more stylistic. The neon lights and symmetrical design of the cybenetic world is an enhanced version of the old Tron. The young acting leads Garrett Hedlund and then later in the movie Olivia Wilde make their impressions felt. Jeff Bridges is made young by CGI, and the effects are passable when distant, and under artificial, glowing light.The upbeat music by Daft Punk made the already stylistic film more so. The entertaining arena scenes are made memorable by the heart thumping, resonant music. Throughout, there are really funky mixes, that remind me of the first time I watched ""the Matrix"". It is the sort of stuff that reminds me of late nights at the rave. I believe that Daft Punk makes an acting cameo as DJ's.As far as length, I would say it fits nicely, and does not over stay its welcome. You do not get much resolution, it falls flat. I, for one, did not have an emotional climax. I wanted a more fleshed-out relationship between Sam and Quorra, who had early chemistry. I felt that the makers of Tron Legacy decided to pay more attention towards making Sam cool, with unshakeable confidence. Instead of showing off with his motorcycle riding skills so much, I craved more for characterization. Especially since they tried to make a more serious movie than the original Tron.The costumes were artistic, and sleek; reminding me of speed bike gear, made for high velocity. The costume department created some visual flair playing with a palette of luminescent colors. The effect of the muted, shadowy presentation of Tron Legacy when matched with the glowing outlines and shapes on the characters is very stimulating. Sometimes there are dim scenes of high contrast when all but the faces and energized patterns of their costumes can be seen. It reminded me of my trip to the modern museum of science's energy revolution department. The costume department was also responsible for easing the burden of having to show a computerized-young Jeff Bridges everytime. They sometimes covered his face with Darth Vader-effect, under a Tron helmet.Tron Legacy is less for young boys, more for a general audience. It is a formulaic movie that makes steps towards being a franchise. I enjoyed the thrilling action, that was complemented by Daft Punk's techno music. It is too serious at times, and the ending is balanced but not memorable. They fell short of revolutionizing the film industry but a worthy sequel to an original that really didn't make much money in the movies.",4,Stylistic movie with great music and action,1293062400,"12 23, 2010",2010,2769,"['Tron', 'Legacy', 'was', 'filmed', 'great', 'effect', 'cybernetic', 'music', 'helped', 'spin', 'intricate', 'computer', 'world', 'Here', 'Joseph', 'Kosinski', 'who', 'did', 'commercials', 'filming', 'latest', 'Tron', 'paid', 'attention', 'making', 'Tron', 'similarity', 'original', 'time', 'much', 'more', 'stylistic', 'neon', 'lights', 'symmetrical', 'design', 'cybenetic', 'world', 'enhanced', 'version', 'old', 'Tron', 'young', 'acting', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'then', 'later', 'movie', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'make', 'impressions', 'felt', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'made', 'young', 'CGI', 'effects', 'are', 'passable', 'when', 'distant', 'artificial', 'glowing', 'light.The', 'upbeat', 'music', 'Daft', 'Punk', 'made', 'already', 'stylistic', 'film', 'more', 'so', 'entertaining', 'arena', 'scenes', 'are', 'made', 'memorable', 'heart', 'thumping', 'resonant', 'music', 'Throughout', 'are', 'really', 'funky', 'mixes', 'remind', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'Matrix', 'sort', 'stuff', 'late', 'nights', 'rave', 'believe', 'Daft', 'Punk', 'acting', 'cameo', ""DJ's.As"", 'far', 'length', 'would', 'say', 'nicely', 'not', 'stay', 'welcome', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'much', 'resolution', 'flat', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'emotional', 'climax', 'wanted', 'more', 'fleshed-out', 'relationship', 'Sam', 'Quorra', 'who', 'had', 'early', 'chemistry', 'felt', 'makers', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'decided', 'pay', 'more', 'attention', 'making', 'Sam', 'cool', 'unshakeable', 'confidence', 'Instead', 'showing', 'off', 'motorcycle', 'riding', 'skills', 'so', 'much', 'craved', 'more', 'characterization', 'Especially', 'tried', 'make', 'more', 'serious', 'movie', 'original', 'Tron.The', 'costumes', 'were', 'artistic', 'sleek', 'reminding', 'speed', 'bike', 'gear', 'made', 'high', 'velocity', 'costume', 'department', 'created', 'visual', 'flair', 'playing', 'palette', 'luminescent', 'colors', 'effect', 'muted', 'shadowy', 'presentation', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'when', 'matched', 'glowing', 'outlines', 'shapes', 'characters', 'very', 'stimulating', 'Sometimes', 'are', 'dim', 'scenes', 'high', 'contrast', 'when', 'energized', 'patterns', 'costumes', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'reminded', 'trip', 'modern', 'museum', 'science', 'energy', 'revolution', 'department', 'costume', 'department', 'was', 'also', 'responsible', 'easing', 'burden', 'having', 'show', 'computerized-young', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'everytime', 'sometimes', 'covered', 'face', 'Darth', 'Vader-effect', 'Tron', 'helmet.Tron', 'Legacy', 'less', 'young', 'boys', 'more', 'general', 'audience', 'formulaic', 'movie', 'steps', 'towards', 'being', 'franchise', 'enjoyed', 'thrilling', 'action', 'was', 'complemented', 'Daft', 'Punk', 'techno', 'music', 'too', 'serious', 'times', 'ending', 'balanced', 'not', 'memorable', 'fell', 'short', 'revolutionizing', 'film', 'industry', 'worthy', 'sequel', 'original', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'money', 'movies']",N/A

1313317,A2KHGS9SWP4LOF,B002ZG99QS,"J. Larsen ""J. Larsen""","[0, 0]","After seeing this revision of a cult Disney Sci-Fi classic last Christmas, I couldn't wait for the DVD to come out.  In a time of never ending rumors circulating online about blockbuster film remakes because of a lack of great storytelling coming out of Hollywood, the time is just right for Walt Disney's TRON to finally journey into the 21st Century.  The 1982 Sci-Fi classic has been long overdue for a major upgrade and thanks to a visionary director, talented screenwriters, genius special effects artists and the wonders of 21st Century computer technology along with the many refined talents of an all star cast, comes a one of a kind digital spectacle more then twenty years in the making.The film takes place twenty years after the sudden disappearance of computer genius and Encom executive, Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) and with his son Sam (Garrett Hedlund) struggling with a deep sense of personal loss and belonging in the present high tech digital age of technology, reluctantly takes it upon himself to reconnect with a long lost relic of his father's genius, an old arcade where he finds in his Dad's office an old computer that launches him into the unpredictable and unbelievable world of TRON.  Here, Sam has to match wits with highly skilled disc throwers, cunning opportunists and a notoriously dangerous replicate of a computer program of Kevin Flynn's design that runs amuck and starts a crusade against father and son as they fight to bring order and balance to the chaotic universe that has become the new world of TRON.  Fortunately, they are not only in their quest.  With the help of Quorra, the daring and charming heroine (Olivia Wilde) takes the lead as Sam's partner and protector throughout the adventure and along the way, the pair finds things out about themselves and their two different worlds that they could only discover together.  From there, the action and peril only builds as the film takes viewers on a ride where misadventures and surprises await the trio at every turn.The film's computer generated visual effects only serve to heighten the grandeur of the characters' environment.  With unique set designs, space age costumes and eerily mysterious weather patterns, all blend in seamlessly well with the film.  Visionary director, Joseph Kosinski, brings an original architectural approach to the futurist revamp of the TRON franchise, which is very appropriate for its time when you're introducing a long and forgotten cult classic to a new generation of movie goers who for the most part, thought ""Avatar"" was the coolest thing they had ever seen.  For me personally, I liked TRON: Legacy way better because of the storyline and the special bonds that develop between the main characters.  Jeff Bridges does a superb job serving as the anchor and guide to the new film and newcomers Garrett Hedlund and Olivia Wilde have excellent chemistry together on screen.  Garrett Hedlund plays the tender role of Sam perfectly and Olivia Wilde shows that Quorra can be loving, athletic and sexy all at the same time.I bought the DVD Blu-Ray pack for the sake of the added behind the scenes special features.  It would have been easier if they had released a two disc version of the new TRON movie on DVD like they did with the original 25th anniversary edition but that's beyond me.  Viewing the special features on Blu-Ray came with a few disappointments with occasional glitches here and there but other then that, the deleted scene of what happened after Sam's adventure and the behind the scenes featurettes about the mythology of the TRON universe were all very impressive.  It will be interesting to see what else Disney has in store for the TRON movie franchise, I guess we'll have to wait and see.  This is an excellent example of what can happen when you combine imagination with the wonders of innovative technology to create something spectacular!For those of you who haven't seen it, the film has a great message about creation and how struggling to find perfection can often leave one blind to exploring other infinite possibilities.  This film is definitely worth a look and with the advent of today's computer technology, well worth its weight in gold.",4,An Awesome Sequel to a Classic that is Overdue for an Upgrade!,1323216000,"12 7, 2011",2011,4206,"['seeing', 'revision', 'cult', 'Disney', 'Sci-Fi', 'classic', 'last', 'Christmas', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'DVD', 'come', 'out', 'time', 'never', 'ending', 'rumors', 'circulating', 'online', 'blockbuster', 'film', 'remakes', 'lack', 'great', 'storytelling', 'coming', 'Hollywood', 'time', 'just', 'right', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'TRON', 'finally', 'journey', '21st', 'Century', '1982', 'Sci-Fi', 'classic', 'been', 'long', 'overdue', 'major', 'upgrade', 'thanks', 'visionary', 'director', 'talented', 'screenwriters', 'genius', 'special', 'effects', 'artists', 'wonders', '21st', 'Century', 'computer', 'technology', 'many', 'refined', 'talents', 'star', 'cast', 'one', 'kind', 'digital', 'spectacle', 'more', 'then', 'twenty', 'years', 'making.The', 'film', 'place', 'twenty', 'years', 'sudden', 'disappearance', 'computer', 'genius', 'Encom', 'executive', 'Kevin', 'Flynn', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'son', 'Sam', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'struggling', 'deep', 'sense', 'personal', 'loss', 'belonging', 'present', 'high', 'tech', 'digital', 'age', 'technology', 'reluctantly', 'reconnect', 'long', 'lost', 'relic', 'father', 'genius', 'old', 'arcade', 'where', 'Dad', 'office', 'old', 'computer', 'unpredictable', 'unbelievable', 'world', 'TRON', 'Here', 'Sam', 'match', 'wits', 'highly', 'skilled', 'disc', 'throwers', 'cunning', 'opportunists', 'notoriously', 'dangerous', 'replicate', 'computer', 'program', 'Kevin', 'Flynn', 'design', 'amuck', 'crusade', 'father', 'son', 'fight', 'bring', 'order', 'balance', 'chaotic', 'universe', 'become', 'new', 'world', 'TRON', 'Fortunately', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'quest', 'help', 'Quorra', 'daring', 'charming', 'heroine', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'lead', 'Sam', 'partner', 'protector', 'adventure', 'way', 'pair', 'things', 'out', 'two', 'different', 'worlds', 'could', 'only', 'discover', 'together', 'there', 'action', 'peril', 'only', 'film', 'viewers', 'ride', 'where', 'misadventures', 'surprises', 'await', 'trio', 'turn.The', 'film', 'computer', 'generated', 'visual', 'effects', 'only', 'serve', 'heighten', 'grandeur', 'characters', 'environment', 'unique', 'set', 'designs', 'space', 'age', 'costumes', 'eerily', 'mysterious', 'weather', 'patterns', 'blend', 'seamlessly', 'well', 'film', 'Visionary', 'director', 'Joseph', 'Kosinski', 'original', 'architectural', 'approach', 'futurist', 'revamp', 'TRON', 'franchise', 'very', 'appropriate', 'time', 'when', ""'re"", 'introducing', 'long', 'forgotten', 'cult', 'classic', 'new', 'generation', 'movie', 'goers', 'who', 'most', 'part', 'thought', 'Avatar', 'was', 'coolest', 'thing', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'personally', 'liked', 'TRON', 'Legacy', 'way', 'better', 'storyline', 'special', 'bonds', 'develop', 'main', 'characters', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'superb', 'job', 'serving', 'anchor', 'guide', 'new', 'film', 'newcomers', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'have', 'excellent', 'chemistry', 'together', 'screen', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'tender', 'role', 'Sam', 'perfectly', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'Quorra', 'can', 'be', 'loving', 'athletic', 'sexy', 'same', 'time.I', 'bought', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'pack', 'sake', 'added', 'scenes', 'special', 'features', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easier', 'had', 'released', 'two', 'disc', 'version', 'new', 'TRON', 'movie', 'DVD', 'did', 'original', '25th', 'anniversary', 'edition', 'Viewing', 'special', 'features', 'Blu-Ray', 'came', 'few', 'disappointments', 'occasional', 'glitches', 'here', 'there', 'other', 'then', 'deleted', 'scene', 'what', 'happened', 'Sam', 'adventure', 'scenes', 'mythology', 'TRON', 'universe', 'were', 'very', 'impressive', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'else', 'Disney', 'store', 'TRON', 'movie', 'franchise', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wait', 'see', 'excellent', 'example', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'when', 'combine', 'imagination', 'wonders', 'innovative', 'technology', 'create', 'something', 'spectacular', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'great', 'message', 'creation', 'how', 'struggling', 'find', 'perfection', 'can', 'often', 'leave', 'one', 'blind', 'exploring', 'other', 'infinite', 'possibilities', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'look', 'advent', 'today', 'computer', 'technology', 'well', 'weight', 'gold']",N/A

I didn't see the link until almost 345pm. And luck had there was a screening in Portland OR. It took me a nearly a hour by bus to get to the theater from where I live but the movie was well worth the time. So again thank you Movieweb for letting me know. Now onto the review.Story: Was the worst part of the movie for me. The theme had been down many times before. Blade Runner and Ghost in the Shell are the first two that come to mind. Sure the first Tron was headed that way but that was over 25 years ago. The idea is machines coming to life creating a new life form and existing in our world. It's nothing new but still the writers did a good job telling the story of a father and son finding each other again after many years apart. The other problem was the character Castor(Michael Sheen). His character was pointless except to movie the story forward. I will be contradicting myself on this point in the next paragraph.Acting/Characters: The acting was really good in this film and it seemed everyone was enjoying their work. Now it's time to contradict my self. Sure Michael Sheen's character was really pointless you could still see he was halving fun playing the character and it won't bother you so much. Olivia Wild(Quorra) show she's so much more than her good looks. Garrett Hedlund(Sam Flynn) I've never heard of before and was the first time I've seen him. He did a really good job and his chemistry with Jeff Bridges was excellent you could just see the emotion when the two characters meet after so many years. Of course I saved the best for last. That being Jeff Bridges(Kevin Flynn/Clu) a truly great actor. I can't remember a bad film I've seen he's been in. From White Squall, Tron, Iron Man to Blown Away, The Big Lebowski and Arlington Road. I'm sure he's been in a bad filmsI just haven't seen them. He is perhaps the best thing in this movie essentially playing two characters. Even Clu a CGI character is brought to life by him. He is really is just one of my favorite actors.Special Effects/Visuals: The effects and the world brought to life I believe it were done by Digital Domain, Quantum, and Mr. X Inc. The world they created was beautifully done and will blow you away.Music: I feel like commenting on the music done by Daft Punk. I might have heard the music before but I've never heard of the band until I saw the trailer for Tron. They are really good and their music brought live to the CGI world.Overall: A great film whose only problem is a decent to good story. Well worth spending your money on. And I hope you do.

Ludwick ""kibitzer""","[1, 5]","The special FX, prod. design, cinematography, and cast bring the world of TRON to life - but can't rise above an obtuse, convoluted, script and the uncanny valley.TRON has a real legacy in the cultures of Hollywood, Cyberpunk, and Special Effects. Critics didn't quite get it, or thought it too simplistic. Years later, TRON is appreciated. I don't think that will happen here.The script spends more time explaining fringe digital technology and connecting creatively stale action scenes instead of building empathy in the characters. It begins themes (information should be free! we work as a team!) without developing those themes adequately in the characters. The light cycles are back - on multiple floors! Light Flyers do the same thing... in the air! The discs are back... as Aerodisks! And some programs have TWO! It's all more, more, more. And why should we care?A film is such a difficult thing to produce, and even harder to make timeless. The producers of this film didn't carve the niche they could have. In the original, bikes could turn 90 on a dime without inertia... because you're in a computer. That was something very unique about the original world of TRON that no other movie has quite exploited (except the Matrix). After a while, you actually forget they're in a computer; they might just as well be in a futuristic city.  That's a negative for me.The villain CLU is a failed digital performance. If you think about how it's done on screen, the effects guys, IMO have not done their job. Everytime I saw CLU, I thought, ""he moves weird"" not ""he's a computer program"".

1313321,AXOO7BPM22BDO,B002ZG99QS,"John Green ""Darkwriter""","[7, 17]","Well, it's finally here.  TRON: Legacy.  The one you've been waiting for.  The denouement to the movie year.  The ne plus ultra of cinematic splendor.  The cherry on the 3D ice cream cone- look, they even digitized the Disney logo!  Oooh, shiny...The movie begins in 1989 with Kevin Flynn (Bridges) telling his young son Sam a bedtime story about the amazing adventures he'd had in The Grid, the virtual world he discovered.  Flynn leaves for Encom, only to never be seen again.  Flash forward to 2010 and Sam is breaking into Encom's servers- now a soulless software corporation- to spread the source code for their new software release.  Subtle.Sam investigates a claim that his father contacted his former BFF Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner) and gets zapped into The Grid and is immediately swept up in its deadly game-oriented culture where he gets the attention of CLU, Flynn's former avatar who's taken over their cyber-realm.  CLU is aided in this by Rinzler, his personal Darth Vader, which is more than enough of a hint.  Turns out Sam's presence here isn't quite so accidental and now he's got to find his father before CLU does.  The Grid has evolved into more than anyone imagined and CLU has some serious daddy issues and no therapist to talk to.  Flynn himself is the key to everything in both The Grid and the User's world and if CLU gets his mitts on him- Game over, man!  Game over!  But Flynn's not alone; he's aided by his beauteous apprentice Quorra, a program who's native to The Grid and dreams of a life in the real world.________________________________________________________________________Seems like folks are way too caught up in the hype and are trying to make more of this movie than it is.  It's fluff and eye candy- grab your tub o' popcorn, put on them 3D specs and lean back in your stadium seat.  Like a friend of mine said- if you saw the original, you've seen this one.  The script and characters couldn't be more by-the-numbers if they came with a paint set.  Even in the relatively deeper moments there's little substance to them.  No mysteries of the universe tucked away in here... though Jeff Bridges' Flynn has taken up Zen and he does seem to be having fun channeling The Dude from Big Lebowski.  Even Michael Sheen's scene-chewing comic turn as Castor, androgynous club owner and rogue, gets boring fast.One thing that really annoyed me was the incessant game metaphors- 'he's changed the game', 'the game has changed', 'you're the new piece on the board', etc.  Ok, ok, we get it- next time could you only hit us over the head with a mallet instead of a sledgehammer?TRON: Legacy recycles everything from the original and adds a few new wrinkles, even if it doesn't all make sense.  Why does Sam have to break into Encom when he's the majority shareholder?  Why do you have a solar sailer in a world with no sunlight?  How'd you come up with roast pork and fresh veggies in The Grid... no, seriously- where did that come from?  Or all those hardcover books?  What's in those drinks everyone's having?  And why couldn't CLU just fly into Outland and find Flynn?  And why did...*sexy, shiny cyber-chick struts by*  Oooh, niiiice...TRON: Legacy is all about the SFX and in that it delivers big time.  Every vehicle, background and enhancement looks spectacular and the lightcycles and lightflyers are amazing and flawless.  I saw it in IMAX 3D- my first IMAX experience- and other than a few blurry spots it looked great, but I can live without it.  Even all the characters were color-coded to help you keep score: good guys are blue, bad guys are red and neutrals are day-glo white.  Kind of reminded me of Dragonlance.  The only downside to the CGI was Jeff Bridges' rendering- looked like his face was molded out of Play-doh.  And the Daft Punk soundtrack completely worked; the music fit the mood perfectly. No complaints there.TRON: Legacy is exactly what it's supposed to be- lots of pretty, glowing, fast moving objects and people.  Anything else would've been excessive.  Maybe even engaging.  But maybe there's room for that stuff in the next one, 'cause when Sam...*light cycle zooms by*  Oooh, pretty...",3,Like A Blonde Joke- Really Pretty But Kinda Dumb,1292457600,"12 16, 2010",2010,4158,"['Well', 'finally', 'here', 'TRON', 'Legacy', 'one', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'denouement', 'movie', 'year', 'ne', 'ultra', 'cinematic', 'splendor', 'cherry', '3D', 'ice', 'cream', 'cone-', 'look', 'even', 'digitized', 'Disney', 'logo', 'Oooh', 'shiny', 'movie', '1989', 'Kevin', 'Flynn', 'Bridges', 'telling', 'young', 'son', 'Sam', 'bedtime', 'story', 'amazing', 'adventures', ""'d"", 'had', 'Grid', 'virtual', 'world', 'discovered', 'Flynn', 'Encom', 'only', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'Flash', 'forward', '2010', 'Sam', 'breaking', 'Encom', 'servers-', 'now', 'soulless', 'software', 'corporation-', 'spread', 'source', 'code', 'new', 'software', 'release', 'Subtle.Sam', 'claim', 'father', 'contacted', 'former', 'BFF', 'Alan', 'Bradley', 'Bruce', 'Boxleitner', 'zapped', 'Grid', 'immediately', 'swept', 'up', 'deadly', 'game-oriented', 'culture', 'where', 'attention', 'CLU', 'Flynn', 'former', 'avatar', 'who', 'taken', 'over', 'cyber-realm', 'CLU', 'aided', 'Rinzler', 'personal', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'more', 'enough', 'hint', 'out', 'Sam', 'presence', 'here', ""n't"", 'quite', 'so', 'accidental', 'now', 'got', 'find', 'father', 'CLU', 'Grid', 'evolved', 'more', 'anyone', 'imagined', 'CLU', 'serious', 'daddy', 'issues', 'therapist', 'talk', 'Flynn', 'key', 'everything', 'Grid', 'User', 'world', 'CLU', 'mitts', 'him-', 'Game', 'man', 'Game', 'Flynn', 'not', 'alone', 'aided', 'beauteous', 'apprentice', 'Quorra', 'program', 'who', 'native', 'Grid', 'dreams', 'life', 'real', 'world.________________________________________________________________________Seems', 'folks', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'caught', 'up', 'hype', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'more', 'movie', 'fluff', 'eye', 'candy-', 'grab', 'tub', 'o', 'popcorn', 'put', '3D', 'specs', 'lean', 'back', 'stadium', 'seat', 'friend', 'mine', 'said-', 'saw', 'original', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'script', 'characters', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'by-the-numbers', 'came', 'paint', 'set', 'Even', 'relatively', 'deeper', 'moments', 'little', 'substance', 'mysteries', 'universe', 'tucked', 'away', 'here', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Flynn', 'taken', 'up', 'Zen', 'seem', 'be', 'having', 'fun', 'channeling', 'Dude', 'Big', 'Lebowski', 'Even', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'scene-chewing', 'comic', 'turn', 'Castor', 'androgynous', 'club', 'owner', 'rogue', 'boring', 'fast.One', 'thing', 'really', 'annoyed', 'was', 'incessant', 'game', 'metaphors-', ""'he"", 'changed', 'game', 'game', 'changed', ""'re"", 'new', 'piece', 'board', 'etc', 'Ok', 'ok', 'get', 'it-', 'next', 'time', 'could', 'only', 'hit', 'head', 'mallet', 'instead', 'sledgehammer', 'TRON', 'Legacy', 'recycles', 'everything', 'original', 'few', 'new', 'wrinkles', 'even', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Why', 'Sam', 'have', 'break', 'Encom', 'when', 'majority', 'shareholder', 'Why', 'do', 'have', 'solar', 'sailer', 'world', 'sunlight', 'How', ""'d"", 'come', 'up', 'roast', 'pork', 'fresh', 'veggies', 'Grid', 'seriously-', 'where', 'did', 'come', 'hardcover', 'books', 'What', 'drinks', 'everyone', 'having', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'CLU', 'just', 'fly', 'Outland', 'find', 'Flynn', 'why', 'did', '*sexy', 'shiny', 'cyber-chick', 'struts', 'by*', 'Oooh', 'niiiice', 'TRON', 'Legacy', 'SFX', 'big', 'time', 'vehicle', 'background', 'enhancement', 'looks', 'spectacular', 'lightcycles', 'lightflyers', 'are', 'amazing', 'flawless', 'saw', 'IMAX', '3D-', 'first', 'IMAX', 'experience-', 'other', 'few', 'blurry', 'spots', 'looked', 'great', 'can', 'live', 'Even', 'characters', 'were', 'color-coded', 'help', 'keep', 'score', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'blue', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'red', 'neutrals', 'are', 'day-glo', 'white', 'Kind', 'reminded', 'Dragonlance', 'only', 'downside', 'CGI', 'was', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'rendering-', 'looked', 'face', 'was', 'molded', 'Play-doh', 'Daft', 'Punk', 'soundtrack', 'completely', 'worked', 'music', 'fit', 'mood', 'perfectly', 'No', 'complaints', 'there.TRON', 'Legacy', 'exactly', 'what', 'supposed', 'be-', 'lots', 'pretty', 'glowing', 'fast', 'moving', 'objects', 'people', 'Anything', 'else', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'excessive', 'Maybe', 'even', 'engaging', 'maybe', 'room', 'stuff', 'next', 'one', 'when', 'Sam', '*light', 'cycle', 'zooms', 'by*', 'Oooh', 'pretty']",N/A

But that's where the uniqueness ends.In trying to make sense out of ""Tron: Legacy"", it helps to have seen the original ""Tron"".  Other scenes you will recognize from other movies anyway.Never mind the fact that the chronology is off and our hero Sam Flynn's age is off by about 7 or 9 years:  The film supposedly takes place in modern day - 2010.  Sam, once in the grid, tells his dad Kevin he is 27 years old.  Kevin disappeared 21 years earlier, back in 1989, making young Sam six years old at the time.  But on the night in 1989 when he disappeared, we see Kevin and Sam talking together and Sam is WAY older than 6.  He's probably closer to 14 years old.  That should make him at least in his early thirties in modern day.  Fail.And there are a great many moments in the film that seem lifted from other films.  I counted at least 2 moments that were blatantly lifted from ""Batman Begins"", two from ""The Dark Knight"", god knows how many from ""The Matrix"", one or two from the original ""Star Wars"", and several cliched moments that could have come from any of a dozen generic action films.When Sam, on a quest to locate his missing father, gets pulled into the grid and is forced to engage in gladiator games, no explanation is offered why those games exist or are necessary.  It is explained in ""Tron"" but not in this sequel.  A newbie to this universe might be left scratching his head.  And seemingly everyone in this new universe knows martial arts.  That wasn't the case in the original ""Tron"", but it seems necessary in ""Legacy"" because movies of recent years feature a lot of martial arts fighting and ""Legacy"" borrows heavily from recent movies.It is great to have Jeff Bridges back on board, but his character in this film is almost indistinguishable from his ""Dude"" character in ""The Big Lebowski"".  His Flynn character in ""Tron"" wasn't at all like that.The film's score is heavy-handed at times.  Even during an overly-long dinner and plot exposition scene, the score plays too loudly and forcefully.  Very intrusive.What drives the thin plot in ""Legacy"" is our hero's attempts to escape from the grid without the chief villain obtaining Kevin Flynn's identity disc.  It is never explicitly clear what the villain really needs it for, either.  There's a lot of talk about the urgency of it but not very specific detail.Sam Flynn manages to escape the grid by employing a move that I doubt he would have known about unless he had seen the first ""Tron"" movie.  So I guess in the ""Tron: Legacy"" universe, the film ""Tron"" had played in theaters or on home video and Sam saw it.  How fortunate.Truth is, aside from the very impressive visuals there is not much in the storytelling of ""Legacy"" that is all that original or compelling.  Most everything about it seems borrowed and the sentimentality seems forced.The Blu-ray release is visually stunning on all fronts and has a satisfying amount of bonus content.  But that stuff is expected nowadays and can hardly be used as a selling point anymore.In the end, ""the play's the thing"".  You can watch it only so many times before the ""wow factor"" of the special effects wears off.  After that, the story has to sustain your interest.

There was not a great deal of emphisis put into the screenplay.It basically plays off as somewhat of a carbon copy of the original.

I also loved the fact that they included the original actors Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxlighter.  There was a lot of action stunts and CGI, with light cycles, cars, flying devices, etc.  A Disney flick, this 2010 release begins in the year 1989 and is approximately 2 hours long.  Bridges/Flynn, who built the Tron gaming system, is talking to his 7 year old son/Kevin.  Flynn disappears that night, leaving Kevin alone.Fast forward to 2009.  Kevin is now 27 and quite wealthy.  He chooses to not participate in the business (ENCOM Company).  Bruce Boxleitner/Alan is still around.  While the board is preparing for a press release on a new product, Kevin sneaks in and hacks into the system because his father would have wanted the software to be available to all.Shortly after, Kevin enters his father's workshop, dives into the system, and accesses the grid.  The adventure begins here as Users and Programmers meet and the games begin.  The light up suits are really neat looking and everyone wears a disc on their back.  The disc is their weapon and it carries all their knowledge.  The light cycles and other transportation devices are too cool, along with the light-up suits and the competition games.  As always, there is a general good guy vs. bad guy theme.  Kevin also finds his father on the grid and the young gaming Bridges wants the knowledge in the disc the old Bridges has.  There is also a young Boxlighter on the grid.I recently read an article that stated the movie's cost at approximately $170 million dollars! Los Angeles visual f/x house ""Digital Domain"" used the latest 3D cameras and motion-capture technology to create the younger version of Bridges.  They captured Bridges' facial movements and then transferred the CG version of Bridges onto another actor.  They then fine-tuned hair, eyes, etc.  French electronic duo Daft Punk created the soundtrack.I very much enjoyed the movie and was pleased at the sequel as a real continuation.",5,Futuristic--Light Cycles & Gaming Come to Life,1295222400,"01 17, 2011",2011,2014,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'sequel', 'original', 'Tron', 'also', 'loved', 'fact', 'included', 'original', 'actors', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Bruce', 'Boxlighter', 'was', 'lot', 'action', 'stunts', 'CGI', 'light', 'cycles', 'cars', 'flying', 'devices', 'etc', 'Disney', 'flick', '2010', 'release', 'year', '1989', 'approximately', '2', 'hours', 'long', 'Bridges/Flynn', 'who', 'built', 'Tron', 'gaming', 'system', 'talking', '7', 'year', 'old', 'son/Kevin', 'Flynn', 'night', 'leaving', 'Kevin', 'alone.Fast', 'forward', '2009', 'Kevin', 'now', '27', 'quite', 'wealthy', 'not', 'participate', 'business', 'ENCOM', 'Company', 'Bruce', 'Boxleitner/Alan', 'still', 'around', 'board', 'preparing', 'press', 'release', 'new', 'product', 'Kevin', 'hacks', 'system', 'father', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'software', 'be', 'available', 'all.Shortly', 'Kevin', 'father', 'workshop', 'system', 'grid', 'adventure', 'here', 'Users', 'Programmers', 'meet', 'games', 'begin', 'light', 'up', 'suits', 'are', 'really', 'neat', 'looking', 'everyone', 'disc', 'back', 'disc', 'weapon', 'knowledge', 'light', 'cycles', 'other', 'transportation', 'devices', 'are', 'too', 'cool', 'light-up', 'suits', 'competition', 'games', 'always', 'general', 'good', 'guy', 'vs.', 'bad', 'guy', 'theme', 'Kevin', 'also', 'father', 'grid', 'young', 'gaming', 'Bridges', 'knowledge', 'disc', 'old', 'Bridges', 'also', 'young', 'Boxlighter', 'grid.I', 'recently', 'read', 'article', 'stated', 'movie', 'cost', 'approximately', '170', 'million', 'dollars', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'visual', 'f/x', 'house', 'Digital', 'Domain', 'used', 'latest', '3D', 'cameras', 'motion-capture', 'technology', 'create', 'younger', 'version', 'Bridges', 'captured', 'Bridges', 'facial', 'movements', 'then', 'transferred', 'CG', 'version', 'Bridges', 'actor', 'then', 'fine-tuned', 'hair', 'eyes', 'etc', 'French', 'electronic', 'duo', 'Daft', 'Punk', 'created', 'soundtrack.I', 'very', 'much', 'movie', 'was', 'pleased', 'sequel', 'real', 'continuation']",N/A

The movie becomes not only amazingly gorgeous but actually quite interesting, mainly due to Jeff Bridges' surprisingly affecting performance. The script could have gone much deeper on the issues of cyber/human interface and where that's taking us, but I guess the Mouse doesn't really ever want to get that deep. A missed opportunity, but then you've got to sell your toys first and foremost!Bridges shows real growth as an actor as compared to the original film; I recall seeing that the weekend it opened with all the other kids eager for New Electronic Graphics! And it delivered, as does its sequel. The light cycle sequences are especially fine and neo-noir glistening, and they make this movie work, along with Bridges. He's easily the highlight, but all the actors are at least decent, and there's less b-movie feel here than I expected.The blu-ray transfer is also stunningly crisp, one of the best I've yet seen, of hundreds. These effects deserved perfect reproduction, and they got it. I can imagine that this flick would be mighty fun in 3D, and look forward to seeing that one day.

(Yeah I know pretty silly right?) First, let me say I love both Films but, I never would even attempt to compare these two total opposites. Let me point out that The Matrix is pure rated R goodness while Tron is a DISNEY film people! Yes Disney so you already know if there is even a hint of violence in the film it would be mild at best. Newbies tend to forget that Tron:Legacy is a sequel to a film that came out way before there was a Matrix. I saw the original Tron when I was 6 years old on my uncles Laser disc (yeah, back in the stone age) then the Matrix came out around my 19th birthday and nobody was comparing those films at the time. Then here comes along Legacy and some people decide to go all looney bin WHY? all because the only thing similar between the two films is a human being entering a computer generated world and that is it!If you are a fan of the first TRON you will probably dissect the entire TRON:Legacy film but, I think you'll still like the movie overall. My only real complaints was that they could of used the 3-D better, what does that mean? well they don't start using 3-D effects until Sam enters the Grid that's over 15 minutes into the movie. I, like most people out there, would've loved to see Sam's Base jump off of the tower in full 3-D. Even Sam's motorcycle escape & evasion of the bike cop would've been cool in 3-D.I didn't like the fact that Tron:Legacy is actually Part 3 of the story. Part 2 of the story was shown to us in a brief flashback and that story seemed to be way more interesting than the Legacy story. Hopefully the next Tron film will address that flashback or maybe they just wanted us to buy the comics that explained it in TRON:Betrayal. Disney was smart with the overall look of the film. If you haven't seen the original TRON lately then let me tell you they were smart to go with the all black with outline lighting because would you have really paid to see the old look in 3-D? (I don't think so!)Compared to the original TRON, TRON:Legacy is a great modern update and I give it 4 stars for that but, because I like the style and the new direction they are taking the storyline, I'll have to add 1 more star for a total of 5 stars.",5,You cant compare this to the Matrix...,1317081600,"09 27, 2011",2011,2320,"['there', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'small', 'group', 'people', 'there', 'comparing', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'Matrix', 'Yeah', 'know', 'pretty', 'silly', 'right', 'First', 'let', 'say', 'love', 'Films', 'never', 'would', 'even', 'attempt', 'compare', 'two', 'total', 'opposites', 'Let', 'point', 'out', 'Matrix', 'pure', 'rated', 'R', 'goodness', 'Tron', 'DISNEY', 'film', 'people', 'Yes', 'Disney', 'already', 'know', 'even', 'hint', 'violence', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'mild', 'best', 'Newbies', 'tend', 'forget', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'sequel', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'way', 'was', 'Matrix', 'saw', 'original', 'Tron', 'when', 'was', '6', 'years', 'old', 'uncles', 'Laser', 'disc', 'yeah', 'back', 'stone', 'age', 'then', 'Matrix', 'came', 'out', '19th', 'birthday', 'nobody', 'was', 'comparing', 'films', 'time', 'Then', 'here', 'along', 'Legacy', 'people', 'decide', 'go', 'looney', 'bin', 'WHY', 'only', 'thing', 'similar', 'two', 'films', 'human', 'being', 'entering', 'computer', 'generated', 'world', 'are', 'fan', 'first', 'TRON', 'will', 'probably', 'dissect', 'entire', 'TRON', 'Legacy', 'film', 'think', ""'ll"", 'still', 'movie', 'overall', 'only', 'real', 'complaints', 'was', 'could', 'used', '3-D', 'better', 'what', 'mean', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'start', 'using', '3-D', 'effects', 'Sam', 'Grid', '15', 'minutes', 'movie', 'most', 'people', 'out', 'there', 'would', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'see', 'Sam', 'Base', 'jump', 'tower', 'full', '3-D', 'Even', 'Sam', 'motorcycle', 'escape', 'evasion', 'bike', 'cop', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'cool', '3-D.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'fact', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'actually', 'Part', '3', 'story', 'Part', '2', 'story', 'was', 'shown', 'brief', 'flashback', 'story', 'seemed', 'be', 'way', 'more', 'interesting', 'Legacy', 'story', 'Hopefully', 'next', 'Tron', 'film', 'will', 'address', 'flashback', 'maybe', 'just', 'wanted', 'buy', 'comics', 'explained', 'TRON', 'Betrayal', 'Disney', 'was', 'smart', 'overall', 'look', 'film', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', 'TRON', 'lately', 'then', 'let', 'tell', 'were', 'smart', 'go', 'black', 'outline', 'lighting', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'paid', 'see', 'old', 'look', '3-D', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'Compared', 'original', 'TRON', 'TRON', 'Legacy', 'great', 'modern', 'update', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'like', 'style', 'new', 'direction', 'are', 'taking', 'storyline', ""'ll"", 'have', 'add', '1', 'more', 'star', 'total', '5', 'stars']",N/A

1313366,A17NVM7IAPF2NS,B002ZG99QS,Maek,"[5, 9]","With a bunch of original-Tron viewers from 1982, Tron:  Legacy had some big shoes to fill.  And boy, does it ever...The original Tron was groundbreaking in terms of its incorporation of CG special effects - the first of its kind to do so in a mind-blowing way.  Granted, the original looks horrifically dated now, but as I explained to my 7-year old daughter:  ""This movie came out when less than 8% of the public owned a computer.  Think about 12 of your friends and then say, 'I'm the only one with a computer.'  Effects like the one in this movie (which has been completely exceeded in PC, PS3, Wii and XBOX 360 games) simply didn't exist.  The original rendering was performed with 2 MB of RAM...you were considered rich if you had a computer with 256KB!""  And Tron was a fun adventure story about programmer Kevin Flynn and his search for evidence linking his name to the creation of blockbuster arcade games stolen by his rival, Ed Dillinger who took over Encom.  Kevin Flynn is inadvertently transported to the computer world by the Master Control Program, an evil AI program that has designs of its own for the real world.  Kevin subsequently meets the security program, Tron, designed by real-world programmer Alan Bradley.  Together, they manage to vanquish the MCP and Kevin obtains the evidence he needs to establish his rightful place within Encom.Tron:  Legacy picks up the story 28 years later.  In the past (1989), we come across Kevin's son Sam Flynn , a boy that has a great relationship with his father who speaks reverently of creating a new computer Grid where he, his own program CLU (""Codified Likeness Utility"" - loved that), and Tron (transported from the original Grid where the MCP had once resided) worked diligently to bring about a new world order.  Kevin is somewhat cryptic about the ""miracle"" that he has found there before leaving his son to go back to work.  Kevin Flynn subsequently disappears leaving Sam as an orphan living with his grandparents.Fast forward to the present and we come across Sam as a reckless recluse who seems to take delight in pulling off an annual prank on Encom (which has become a greedy, directionless corporation).  Alan Bradley still works for the company, but his shared views of Kevin Flynn's dream of making data management/sharing more accessible and affordable to everyone is obviously quashed under the current corporate machine.Alan Bradley then receives a mysterious page on a quite antiquated pager (something that the movie does well in poking fun at) from Flynn's old arcade building.  Alan relays the information to Sam who discovers his father's secret project and, in turn, is transported to the computer world as well.  What follows is a wonderful story filled with religious allegory and reunification intertwined with bittersweet circumstances where CLU has usurped his own creator in his own quest for perfection.  I won't spoil the movie for you beyond that.  I will say this, however; many critics have lit up Olivia Wilde's role by stating that her purpose is to ""look pretty.""  I will give this much up:  Olivia Wilde brings to the role a childlike wonder of everything that she hears about the real world with a great deal of heartfelt sincerity and believability.  It's almost hard to imagine that she IS acting it, because she pulls it off quite well.  To speak any more of it would be to ruin a potential plot point, so I won't.  I just wanted to throw it out there, however, because critics were unduly harsh.I was 9 when I watched the original, but as a parent now, the pang of watching Kevin's son dealing with the loss of his father hits me square in the chest.  Like I mentioned earlier, the movie has grown up with me and it's a powerful nod and acknowledgment for those of us who loved the original Tron as kids and who are watching the current movie now as adults.  The story's theme is darker and certainly delves into the ""human condition"" and everything about the agony of suffering your own mistakes, however well-intentioned your purposes were.There have been too many critics who have lambasted this film and I simply think that they don't get it.  Roger Ebert, at least, seems to get it quite well - he loved the original Tron and gives Tron:  Legacy a solid 3 out of 4 stars.  Too many others don't, however, and seem to feel that anyone who loves this film is a ""fanboy"" of sorts.Well, count me in as a ""fanboy"".  Tron:  Legacy has created a beautiful story and the visuals are stunning to say the least.  The soundtrack is an awesome landscape as well; kudos to Daft Punk for constructing a soundtrack that is quite an impressive blend of both electronica and the London Philharmonic.  Thanks, Disney, for making a 9-year old boy smile again and for making our children shake their heads in wonder about a past that was yet to experience a digital revolution in both life and

Tron Legacy is a stunning computer graphics adventure. Unfortunately, viewers will get the feeling that the film is missing something.The film's synopsis is rather disappointing and could have been better. The plot takes place after the original film. If you have not seen it, do not worry because the events that take place are not necessary to know what is going on. At the same time, it would have been better if the film had not try to stay close to the original. The plot is trying to explain what happened in a gap of nearly 20 years (between the first film and this one). As it attempts to explains, it weakens the plot. It is hard not to notice because the film tries so hard to explain the history of Tron while having various inconsistencies. On the other hand, the characters that bring livelihood into the original has returned. The concept of a going inside the world of computers is truly amazing and makes the film a fantastic adventure.The best part is the special effects. Since the setting of most of the film is inside a computer world, the special effects illustrate the vividness of the realm. Even though this world is only numbers, Disney wows people with the power of imagination and makes viewers wish they were there. The only disappointing thing is CGI Jeff Bridges. It can be easily seen throughout the film which is the real actor himself and a computer generated young version of himself. The computer graphics are amazing in HD. Unlike other films that rely heaving on CGI, this film's special effects is a core element in making it artwork.Another awesome element is the music. The soundtrack by Daft Punk makes the audience feel like they are in this world described in the film. Daft Punk did an excellent job of creating music that follows the mood of the films from action scenes to dramatic and sentimental moments. Like special effects, the music does an good job at bringing viewers into this world of computer programs.Overall, Tron Legacy will most definitely bring your imagination to life and make you want to wish you were a character in this film. On the other hand, Disney could have done better with the plot that was too afraid to leave the film's origins. It succeed in what the previous film could not,special effects, but sacrificed a potentially good plot to fabricate a history lesson that is not necessary of viewers to know.",4,Amazing But Had More Potential,1358208000,"01 15, 2013",2013,2500,"['sequel', 'original', 'film', 'released', '1982', 'must', 'say', 'film', 'truly', 'stepped', 'up', 'terms', 'visuals', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'stunning', 'computer', 'graphics', 'adventure', 'Unfortunately', 'viewers', 'will', 'get', 'feeling', 'film', 'missing', 'something.The', 'film', 'synopsis', 'rather', 'disappointing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'plot', 'place', 'original', 'film', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'do', 'not', 'worry', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'are', 'not', 'necessary', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'same', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'film', 'had', 'not', 'try', 'stay', 'close', 'original', 'plot', 'trying', 'explain', 'what', 'happened', 'gap', 'nearly', '20', 'years', 'first', 'film', 'one', 'explains', 'plot', 'hard', 'not', 'notice', 'film', 'tries', 'so', 'hard', 'explain', 'history', 'Tron', 'having', 'various', 'inconsistencies', 'other', 'hand', 'characters', 'bring', 'livelihood', 'original', 'returned', 'concept', 'going', 'world', 'computers', 'truly', 'amazing', 'film', 'fantastic', 'adventure.The', 'best', 'part', 'special', 'effects', 'setting', 'most', 'film', 'inside', 'computer', 'world', 'special', 'effects', 'illustrate', 'vividness', 'realm', 'Even', 'world', 'only', 'numbers', 'Disney', 'people', 'power', 'imagination', 'viewers', 'wish', 'were', 'there', 'only', 'disappointing', 'thing', 'CGI', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'seen', 'film', 'real', 'actor', 'computer', 'generated', 'young', 'version', 'computer', 'graphics', 'are', 'amazing', 'HD', 'other', 'films', 'rely', 'heaving', 'CGI', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'core', 'element', 'making', 'artwork.Another', 'awesome', 'element', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'Daft', 'Punk', 'audience', 'feel', 'are', 'world', 'described', 'film', 'Daft', 'Punk', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'creating', 'music', 'mood', 'films', 'action', 'scenes', 'dramatic', 'sentimental', 'moments', 'special', 'effects', 'music', 'good', 'job', 'bringing', 'viewers', 'world', 'computer', 'programs.Overall', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'will', 'most', 'definitely', 'bring', 'imagination', 'life', 'make', 'want', 'wish', 'were', 'character', 'film', 'other', 'hand', 'Disney', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'plot', 'was', 'too', 'afraid', 'leave', 'film', 'origins', 'succeed', 'what', 'previous', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'special', 'effects', 'sacrificed', 'potentially', 'good', 'plot', 'fabricate', 'history', 'lesson', 'not', 'necessary', 'viewers', 'know']",N/A

It was a hit film that year and when released on video and later DVD became a hit as well, even though it hadn't been available for some time. And now a new generation has access to not only the original film but a sequel that takes us back to the Grid, back to a place no one has ever seen, back to the world of TRON.TRON LEGACY picks up some years after the original. The opening scenes take place a few years later but soon after the world changes. Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) promised his son he'd be back but for some reason he disappeared. Never seen again the company he began with friend Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner) is different. Encom is now about to go global and rather than become the open and file sharing system Flynn intended it to be, it's main goal is profits and security.Security that's not quite as good as they would hope. For into the secret board meeting sneaks a single minded individual with something on his mind, a way to open up the portals to the net and share the newest version of Encom's favorite program. That person is Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund), the major shareholder in the company who yearly stirs the pot and disrupts the aims of the company, aims that he knows his father would not have shared.After being caught and released from jail, Sam goes home to find Alan waiting for him. They talk, banter back and forth and then Alan tells Sam he received a page from his father's old storefront, the video arcade he owned where it all began. Passing along a key Flynn left him for safekeeping, he encourages Sam to check it out.Sam's curiosity is piqued and he does indeed go to the old battered arcade, game machines draped in plastic that come to life along with the jukebox when he flips the power switch. Noticing the Tron game his father designed and promised to play with him the day before he disappeared, he tries to play it only to have his quarter slip out. It lands on the floor and he notices groves where the machine has moved. Pushing it aside he finds a door that leads to his father's inner sanctum, where he made everything, where he planned to release the new idea he had that would have changed the world. Touching his computer screen, it comes to life and Sam finds himself digitized just as his father was and tossed into the Grid, the computer world.First on the agenda is Sam being picked up and sent to the games, a virtual battle of life and death involving the information discs that each player carries on their back. He survives and attempts an escape but not before being captured by the best of the best and taken to the ruler of this world. Once there the ruler is revealed as...Flynn! But not quite. Though he may appear to be Flynn on the surface, in reality this is Clu, the program produced by Flynn years ago to create the perfect world. And Sam isn't a part of the world Clu sees.Once again in the games, this time on light cycles, Sam takes on the best team there is and then escapes with the help of Quorra (Olivia Wilde), a program sent to aid him in his escape. They do so and she takes him off the grid to a secret location where he finally meets his father, the real one. They talk and spend a short time together during which Flynn tells Sam that he never sent the page. It has to be something Clu has put together. It ends up being a chance to use the portal to the real world where Clu hopes to take his digital army and make them real in an attempt to control it all. Only Flynn and his son now stand in his way.The original film was an amazing piece of work filled with special effects that were dazzling at the time. A bit dated by today's standards, the folks behind LEGACY have taken all of the main ideas, the design of the Grid, the games, the discs and vehicles and updated them for a more digitized world. Effects have grown during the 28 years since the original and it shows in all of the amazing effects seen here. Perhaps the most amazing isn't the vehicles seen in nearly all commercials for the film but the fact that they make Jeff Bridges look like he did 28 years ago when he appears as Clu.But without actors, without a heart, what kind of movie would it have made? Here we have a story, seemingly simple, where the efforts of a few dedicated individuals attempt to make things right. Where good guys take on bad guys to save the day. And where a father and son have the opportunity to meet once again after so long apart.Filled with plenty of action and enough science fiction know how to please fans of the genre, TRON LEGACY lives up to the expectations that many fans will have for the film. I found it to not only live up to the original but to take it into a new dimension as well. It was fun, it was fast and it made me want to watch the old one beside this one and that makes this a legacy fulfilled.",4,THE MAGIC CONTINUES,1302134400,"04 7, 2011",2011,4914,"['1982', 'height', 'video', 'arcade', 'games', 'popularity', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'fans', 'clamored', 'see', 'was', 'hit', 'film', 'year', 'when', 'released', 'video', 'later', 'DVD', 'became', 'hit', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'available', 'time', 'now', 'new', 'generation', 'access', 'not', 'only', 'original', 'film', 'sequel', 'back', 'Grid', 'back', 'place', 'one', 'ever', 'seen', 'back', 'world', 'TRON.TRON', 'LEGACY', 'up', 'years', 'original', 'opening', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'soon', 'world', 'changes', 'Kevin', 'Flynn', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'promised', 'son', ""'d"", 'be', 'back', 'reason', 'disappeared', 'Never', 'seen', 'again', 'company', 'began', 'friend', 'Alan', 'Bradley', 'Bruce', 'Boxleitner', 'different', 'Encom', 'now', 'go', 'global', 'rather', 'become', 'open', 'file', 'sharing', 'system', 'Flynn', 'intended', 'be', 'main', 'goal', 'profits', 'security.Security', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'would', 'hope', 'secret', 'board', 'meeting', 'single', 'minded', 'individual', 'something', 'mind', 'way', 'open', 'up', 'portals', 'net', 'share', 'newest', 'version', 'Encom', 'favorite', 'program', 'person', 'Sam', 'Flynn', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'major', 'shareholder', 'company', 'who', 'yearly', 'pot', 'aims', 'company', 'father', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'shared.After', 'being', 'caught', 'released', 'jail', 'Sam', 'home', 'find', 'Alan', 'waiting', 'talk', 'banter', 'back', 'forth', 'then', 'Alan', 'Sam', 'received', 'page', 'father', 'old', 'storefront', 'video', 'arcade', 'owned', 'where', 'began', 'Passing', 'key', 'Flynn', 'left', 'safekeeping', 'Sam', 'check', 'curiosity', 'piqued', 'indeed', 'go', 'old', 'battered', 'arcade', 'game', 'machines', 'draped', 'plastic', 'come', 'life', 'jukebox', 'when', 'power', 'switch', 'Noticing', 'Tron', 'game', 'father', 'designed', 'promised', 'play', 'day', 'disappeared', 'play', 'only', 'have', 'quarter', 'slip', 'floor', 'groves', 'where', 'machine', 'moved', 'Pushing', 'door', 'father', 'inner', 'sanctum', 'where', 'made', 'everything', 'where', 'planned', 'release', 'new', 'idea', 'had', 'would', 'have', 'changed', 'world', 'Touching', 'computer', 'screen', 'life', 'Sam', 'digitized', 'just', 'father', 'was', 'tossed', 'Grid', 'computer', 'world.First', 'agenda', 'Sam', 'being', 'picked', 'sent', 'games', 'virtual', 'battle', 'life', 'death', 'involving', 'information', 'discs', 'player', 'back', 'escape', 'not', 'being', 'captured', 'best', 'best', 'taken', 'ruler', 'world', 'Once', 'ruler', 'revealed', 'Flynn', 'not', 'quite', 'may', 'appear', 'be', 'Flynn', 'surface', 'reality', 'Clu', 'program', 'produced', 'Flynn', 'years', 'ago', 'create', 'perfect', 'world', 'Sam', ""n't"", 'part', 'world', 'Clu', 'sees.Once', 'again', 'games', 'time', 'light', 'cycles', 'Sam', 'best', 'team', 'then', 'help', 'Quorra', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'program', 'sent', 'aid', 'escape', 'do', 'so', 'off', 'grid', 'secret', 'location', 'where', 'finally', 'father', 'real', 'one', 'talk', 'spend', 'short', 'time', 'together', 'Flynn', 'Sam', 'never', 'sent', 'page', 'be', 'something', 'Clu', 'put', 'together', 'up', 'being', 'chance', 'use', 'portal', 'real', 'world', 'where', 'Clu', 'take', 'digital', 'army', 'make', 'real', 'attempt', 'control', 'Only', 'Flynn', 'son', 'now', 'stand', 'way.The', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'amazing', 'piece', 'work', 'filled', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'dazzling', 'time', 'bit', 'dated', 'today', 'standards', 'folks', 'LEGACY', 'have', 'taken', 'main', 'ideas', 'design', 'Grid', 'games', 'discs', 'vehicles', 'updated', 'more', 'digitized', 'world', 'Effects', 'have', 'grown', '28', 'years', 'original', 'amazing', 'effects', 'seen', 'here', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'amazing', ""n't"", 'vehicles', 'seen', 'nearly', 'commercials', 'film', 'fact', 'make', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'look', 'did', '28', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'Clu.But', 'actors', 'heart', 'what', 'kind', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'Here', 'have', 'story', 'seemingly', 'simple', 'where', 'efforts', 'few', 'dedicated', 'individuals', 'attempt', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'Where', 'good', 'guys', 'take', 'bad', 'guys', 'save', 'day', 'where', 'father', 'son', 'have', 'opportunity', 'meet', 'once', 'again', 'so', 'long', 'apart.Filled', 'plenty', 'action', 'enough', 'science', 'fiction', 'know', 'how', 'please', 'fans', 'genre', 'TRON', 'LEGACY', 'up', 'expectations', 'many', 'fans', 'will', 'have', 'film', 'found', 'not', 'only', 'live', 'up', 'original', 'take', 'new', 'dimension', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'fun', 'was', 'fast', 'made', 'want', 'watch', 'old', 'one', 'beside', 'one', 'legacy', 'fulfilled']",N/A

No one was willing to watch it with me, for some reason. Maybe because the first one sucked, I don't know. I don't really remember the first one very well, considering the last time we used the VCR was...a long time ago. I was probably ten when I last saw Tron. I do recall that it wasn't terribly impressing, so that's something.Anyway, I liked this movie. It started out with a not-particularly-likable main character. The kid has daddy issues and doesn't see the common sense of taking over the company himself rather than playing the occasional practical joke on them, which probably cost them a good deal of money. In this particular area, the writing is lacking. The character shows himself to be a dynamic character, sure. He learns from his experiences and comes out with a greater respect for what his mentor has been saying all his life, but this is not presented well, I think. ""You're right."" he says.""About what?"" Alan asks.""Everything.""The problem is that this particular interchange is not explained very well. I, for one, had no idea what the ""everything"" was. For all I knew, it meant he should take out the trash.So it could've used some work.The story, however, mostly takes a backseat to the graphics. Most of the time, they are spectacular. In fact, I almost got a headache from all the spectacular graphics. Some of the time, like with the digitally-altered face of Clu, it's kinda obviously CGI, but that's OK, considering it IS a movie about a CGI WORLD.For some reason, despite a lot of things not working well in this movie, I really liked it.

1313376,A2MHDZXWWF0VIN,B002ZG99QS,Matthew Kresal,"[0, 0]","Twenty-eight years after Tron first hit cinema screen in 1982, the long awaited sequel Tron: Legacy finally saw the light of day. Given both the advances of special effects and the legacy (no pun intended) of the original film, Tron: Legacy found itself with a high set of expectations before it. Keeping both of those things in mind, how does Legacy stand up as a sequel to the original film?Let's start by looking at the two retuning cast members from the original film: Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner who both reprise their two roles from the original film. Bridges plays both Kevin Flynn and his digital avatar, the program named CLU. The Flynn of Legacy is quite different from the quirky everyman seen in the original film, this Flynn being more philosophic as well as having a dash of both Bridges' The Dude character and just a bit of Obi-Wan Kenobi thrown in for good measure. While that might make one think the character would be unrecognizable, just the reverse is true as Bridges presents a believable nevertheless as a continuation of the character. CLU is, while wearing Flynn's face from the 1980s, is very much different as he has become a tyrannical ruler bent on creating what is perfection in his own eyes. Boxleitner reprises the roles of Alan Bradley and Tron, both of which are effectively extended cameo appearances but comes across as crucial to the film's plot. Both actors are able to reprise their younger roles thanks to a bit of digital de-aging that for the most part works incredibly well (though some of the shots of the younger Flynn are very noticeable due to the lighting). The result is a nice link back to the original film that nevertheless expands on the original character's.The majority of the cast though are new characters. Playing Flynn's now grown son Sam is Garrett Hedlund who, like Bridges in the original film, convincingly portrays a fairly normal person sent into a digital world. Outshining him to a certain degree is Olivia Wilde as the program Quorra whose performance perfectly captures what is effectively an innocent abroad character with an action film twist. It also helps that Hedlund and Wilde share a good deal of chemistry between them which helps the film out as well. Also appearing in the supporting cast is an almost unrecognizable Michael Sheen as Castor, James Frain as CLU's henchman Jarvis and Beau Garrett as Gem. The film is also full of countless supporting characters who appear for only a scene or so at a time but immensely help to sell the reality of the film's digital world. All together, the cast serves the film well which is always a plus.The production values of Legacy are worthy of note for a whole number of reasons. The original production values of Tron from its production design to its costumes and early CGI effects created a vision of a digital world iconic decades later. Iconic yet on the surface dated due to the limitations of 1980s technology. The biggest challenge that Legacy would face would be updating that world for a 21st century audience. In that regard, Legacy succeeds. The film takes the iconic elements of the first film such as the Lightcycles and disc battles but gives them a modern edge. Compare for example the ""new"" lightcycles with the ""old"" lightcycle seen later in the film. They're both light cycles but the ""new"" one has a less plastic feel to it, as if it's been streamlined down to basics. The same is true of the costumes which have the same silhouette but have been given both a dark coloring and the ability to emit actual light (rather than having it more or less pasted on afterwards). Legacy also has a lot more physical sets in its digital world, called ""the Grid"", which make it perhaps a more believable world with a solid feeling to it.  That isn't to downgrade what was done in the original film by any means of course but Legacy takes what was done there and, with nearly three decades of technological advancement, takes it up a level while still remaining true to it.Last but not least, is the plot and script for Legacy. The original Tron has fairly been called simplistic in terms of its plotting and the same can just as fairly be said about its sequel here. The film, minus some flashbacks, is set twenty-eight years after the original. Kevin Flynn, head of Encom and a man apparently on the brink of some breakthrough, disappeared in 1989. Twenty years later, with Alan Bradley now a relatively minor member of Encom's board and Flynn's son Sam largely uninterested in the company, a mysterious message sends Sam on a course onto the Grid. Legacy follows many of the same beats as the original film in terms of the order of sequences showing off different aspects of the digital world. That isn't to say that it is a rip-off by any means. Legacy, appropriately enough, deals with the theme of legacies throughout. In the real world, Sam and Alan are dealing with Flynn's disappearance twenty years on. The Grid is being directed by CLU towards some secret goal, which CLU hopes will allow him to once and for all overcome Flynn's legacy. Last but not least is Flynn himself who, with Sam's arrival, begins at long last a journey that will see him facing the consequences of actions in a world he has disconnected from. Like the first film, Legacy is a simple plot that embodies some sizeable ideas just beneath the surface.Where does that leave Legacy then as a sequel? The performances of both returning actors and new actors is on par with that seen in the original film, the production values and effects bring the iconic world of the original into the modern day and the script has the same fault as the original one did in being perhaps overly simplistic in terms of plot while harboring some intriguing ideas. I would argue that, quality wise, Legacy is on par with the original film in terms of pure enjoyment as a sci-fi adventure film. Whether it will be as iconic as the original though is something that only time will tell.",4,Tron: 28 Years Later,1326067200,"01 9, 2012",2012,5981,"['Twenty-eight', 'years', 'Tron', 'first', 'hit',

I am not a collector of special editions and such.

Soundtrack, dialog and effects sounded excellent and fit the movie well. Watching the movie in 3D really drew me in and at times, due to the clarity and flawless 3D, I truly felt as if I could reach out and touch the actors. The 3D effects were not (but a few) of the ""in your face"" kind of effects but rather the 3D effect gave a great sense of depth to the movie and the feeling that you were standing in the scene.I enjoyed the movie as the acting, animation, story (yet simple), graphic beauty and sound were all put together well which resulted in a fine sequel.My viewing environment consisted of:Samsung UN55C8000 55-Inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D LED HDTVSony BDP-S570 3D Blu-Ray playerDenon AVR-1611 ReceiverINFINITY TSS-450 PLATINUM 5.1 Home Theater Speaker SystemUltimate3DHeaven Ultra-Clear Samsung compatible 3D Glasses",5,My Tron:Legacy 3D review ...in a nutshell....2 thumbs up!,1302220800,"04 8, 2011",2011,1253,"['purchased', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'Four-Disc', 'Combo', 'Blu-ray', '3D', '/', 'Blu-ray', '/', 'DVD', '/', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'pack', 'strictly', '3D', 'blu-ray', 'disc', 'am', 'not', 'collector', 'special', 'editions', 'such', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'comment', 'pack', 'itself.The', 'movie', 'out', '2D', 'fine', 'suspected', '3D', 'portions', 'movie', 'would', 'kick', 'once', 'are', 'taken', 'grid', 'did', '3D', 'looked', 'flawless', 'clarity', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Soundtrack', 'dialog', 'effects', 'sounded', 'excellent', 'fit', 'movie', 'well', 'Watching', 'movie', '3D', 'really', 'drew', 'times', 'due', 'clarity', 'flawless', '3D', 'truly', 'felt', 'could', 'reach', 'out', 'touch', 'actors', '3D', 'effects', 'were', 'not', 'few', 'face', 'kind', 'effects', 'rather', '3D', 'effect', 'gave', 'great', 'sense', 'depth', 'movie', 'feeling', 'were', 'standing', 'scene.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'acting', 'animation', 'story', 'yet', 'simple', 'graphic', 'beauty', 'sound', 'were', 'put', 'together', 'well', 'resulted', 'fine', 'sequel.My', 'viewing', 'environment', 'consisted', 'Samsung', 'UN55C8000', '55-Inch', '1080p', '240', 'Hz', '3D', 'LED', 'HDTVSony', 'BDP-S570', '3D', 'Blu-Ray', 'playerDenon', 'AVR-1611', 'ReceiverINFINITY', 'TSS-450', 'PLATINUM', '5.1', 'Home', 'Theater', 'Speaker', 'SystemUltimate3DHeaven', 'Ultra-Clear', 'Samsung', 'compatible', '3D', 'Glasses']",N/A

After seeing this movie in the theatre and buying the DVD and original Tron film on DVD, I actually prefer this one by leaps and bounds.  Overall, I think the story, acting, film score, and visual elements are all better than the first Tron movie - and not just because of better computer graphics.  A lot of my friends have criticized this movie, saying it's not nearly as good as the original Tron, or the story wasn't good.  I'm not sure what anyone expected from a movie about people getting sucked into a computer.  I can't imagine the story or any other part of this movie being better than it is.  I think Disney did an amazing job with this.You might be wondering after all my praise why I rated this 4 stars instead of 5.  The only reason is actually the DVD features.  I think they could have put more special features on the DVD for nerds like me who loved the movie and want to know more about how it was made.  I know there are Blu-Ray combo packs that have lots of other features, but I just felt like the DVD was lacking.  I am old school and sticking to DVD for now, but maybe someday I'll get a Blu-Ray player and get another version of this with more features.Anyway, all in all, great movie for kids and adults alike.

1313388,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B002ZG99QS,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 2]","I remember a few things about the original 1982 film: the light cycles, the throwing glowing Frisbees, the giant flying staplers, the Master Control Program, and the outfits.  That's it.  I thought Tron was the name of the entire universe (it's not).  Basically, I remembered Tron for its technology, not its plot.Which perhaps explains why I was confused watching Tron: Legacy. Is Tron (the computer program) going to be in this movie? What's Space Paranoids?  And why is a CGI-simulation of Jeff Bridge's head talking to his son? MASTER SPOILER: The answers in order are sort of, still don't know, and hopefully you didn't notice that CGI head because you're going to see a lot of it.ENCOM, the game company from the first film, is an Apple-like proxy in the second; its board has lost its way, arrogantly above all reproach and releasing the same operating system with few improvements (it's up to OS-12).  They refuse to release the OS for free, a reminder of the old LINUX debate.  Early in the movie it seems like Tron: Legacy might have a lot to say about the state of technology.But then Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund) gets sucked into the program and everyone is poorly lit. The light cycles are back, the giant flying staplers are back, the Frisbees are back, but Master Control is oddly nowhere to be found.  We have a new villain in CLU, who features the same Jeff Bridges digitized head that we saw in the flashback.  Tron: Legacy features flashbacks both to reality and within the mainframe, which makes for a series of jarring transitions.  I half-expected the flashbacks to look like pixilated Atari 2600-style graphics.What we get is Bridges as a digital version of the Dude from The Big Lebowski and wide-eyed hottie Quorra (Olivia Wilde) lounging in various cyber-chic poses. The plot -- oh right, this is a film with a plot! - is that our real-life Users must make it back to the portal to the outside world before CLU uses it to transport his digital army back through it.Tron's entire premise pivots on your ability to buy into this universe.  There's a new race of programs called the ISOs who ""spontaneously evolved"" and were subsequently killed off.  CLU is processing other rogue programs to be Stormtrooper-like followers, but it's never made clear what defines a ""rogue"" program.  Programs hang out at bars, eat food, paw at each other (porn?) and there are even homeless drunk programs (Internet?).CLU's plan isn't really explained...will his followers have any weapons when they show up in the real world?  It looks like he plans to invade Earth with a few thousand troops.  Dangerous, sure, but enough to take over the world?  Not even close.  The original Tron movie confined its ambitions to technology we could understand: blackmail, video games, and broadcasts of secret code.  Tron: Legacy blows all that in the first five minutes and instead turns into space invaders.As a laser light effects show, Tron: Legacy is amazing, but two hours is simply too much.  As a coherent movie, it's largely the Marix with more glowy parts: There's the dangerous chick in leather who guards our clueless hero, the villain who wants to create rigid conformity, the battle to escape one world to enter the next, and a lot of spiritual mumbo-jumbo about the nature of the soul and its role in the universe.Bridges spouts most of that pseudo-philosophy here, and it's hard not to giggle when he says, ""you're messing with my Zen thing, man.""

While not in 3-D, this version may in fact add some clarity to the scenes.  From a visual and sonic level this is probably the best Blu-ray disc out there.  That's saying something with ""Avatar"" sitting on the shelf.  The cycle chases are spectacular, clear and exciting.  The Daft Punk soundtrack is a perfect match for this film.  I can't remember a better synch of sound and vision.  What's missing is a better story, but hey this is silly cyberspace so I can accept the existing premise.  Unfortunately, with all the attention given to the technology, the filmmakers gave us characters without a wisp of emotion.  For example, when Flynn (Jeff Bridges) sees his son Sam (Garrett Hedlund) for the first time in 20 some years, you would expect more than grabbing his shoulders and saying ""how ya' doin'.""  Olivia Wilde's character Quorra is expected to be cool.  After all she's an isochip.  But she warms up along the way.  Sam?  It's like she's his pet dog or something.  Hey dummy, it's Olivia Wilde!

I even tried renting it recently only to find it out of print. Don't they normally release those kind of movies when a new one is coming out to make more cash? Anyways, back to one of the most hyped films of the year, Tron Legacy.Knowing that the visuals were sure to be outstanding, I was worried that everything else would suffer. Yeah the story and dialogue are hit and miss at times, but as a whole I was just transfixed for the entire two hours. There is a neat Blade Runner type vibe going on.It has been a long time since a film's musical score has fit this perfectly. I have to buy myself a copy of this soundtrack by Daft Punk. Think Blade Runner or anything by Tangerine Dream. It has a nice 80's feel to it, without seeming dated. It just takes the already intoxicating images to a whole new level.The cast is quite strong with Jeff Bridges back in action as the same character he played in 1982. The guy playing his son never got on my nerves (always a plus) and Olivia Wilde was nice to look at. Michael Sheen even shows up in a odd, yet interesting minor role.A couple of small negatives would be that it starts somewhat slow and runs maybe ten minutes too long, but other than that, I have little else to complain about. Well, the young CGI version of Jeff Bridges wasn't great, but I could buy it a whole lot more once they entered the game world.The IMAX 3-D was the best I've seen since Avatar. It's sole purpose is to put you in the world, not just tease you with stuff flying out of the screen.The bottom line is that Tron Legacy was more than I expected it to be. Before today, I never would have thought it possible that I would consider this movie one of the 10 best of 2010, but in this case, I'm glad I proved myself wrong.4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars",5,"Oh, what sights...what sounds...",1292630400,"12 18, 2010",2010,1955,"['must', 'first', 'confess', 'never', 'saw', 'nearly', 'three', 'decade', 'old', 'Tron', 'knew', 'enough', 'going', 'people', 'know', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'various', 'online', 'means', 'even', 'tried', 'renting', 'recently', 'only', 'find', 'print', 'Do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'release', 'kind', 'movies', 'when', 'new', 'one', 'coming', 'out', 'make', 'more', 'cash', 'Anyways', 'back', 'one', 'most', 'hyped', 'films', 'year', 'Tron', 'Legacy.Knowing', 'visuals', 'were', 'sure', 'be', 'outstanding', 'was', 'worried', 'everything', 'else', 'would', 'suffer', 'Yeah', 'story', 'dialogue', 'are', 'hit', 'miss', 'times', 'whole', 'was', 'just', 'transfixed', 'entire', 'two', 'hours', 'neat', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'type', 'vibe', 'going', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'film', 'musical', 'score', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'have', 'buy', 'copy', 'soundtrack', 'Daft', 'Punk', 'Think', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'anything', 'Tangerine', 'Dream', 'nice', '80', 'feel', 'seeming', 'dated', 'just', 'already', 'intoxicating', 'images', 'whole', 'new', 'level.The', 'cast', 'quite', 'strong', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'back', 'action', 'same', 'character', 'played', '1982', 'guy', 'playing', 'son', 'never', 'got', 'nerves', 'always', 'plus', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'was', 'nice', 'look', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'even', 'up', 'odd', 'yet', 'interesting', 'minor', 'role.A', 'couple', 'small', 'negatives', 'would', 'be', 'somewhat', 'slow', 'maybe', 'ten', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'other', 'have', 'little', 'else', 'complain', 'Well', 'young', 'CGI', 'version', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'could', 'buy', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'entered', 'game', 'world.The', 'IMAX', '3-D', 'was', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Avatar', 'sole', 'purpose', 'put', 'world', 'not', 'just', 'tease', 'stuff', 'flying', 'screen.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'was', 'more', 'expected', 'be', 'today', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'possible', 'would', 'consider', 'movie', 'one', '10', 'best', '2010', 'case', ""'m"", 'glad', 'proved', 'wrong.4', '1/2', '5', 'stars']",N/A
1313396,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B002ZG99QS,Monty Moonlight,"[1, 1]","In the first ""TRON"", a video game designer named Kevin Flynn, searching for proof that his work was stolen from him, became trapped within the digital world he helped to create, forced to fight in gladiator-style games to the death against computer programs that appeared very human in the world of the Grid. It was a strange world in which the programs viewed the ""Users"" of the real world as godlike figures. TRON was the greatest gamer on the grid, and TRON fought for the Users.""TRON Legacy"" takes us back to the world of the Grid, when Kevin's son, Flynn, follows a mysterious message from his long lost father and ends up trapped on the Grid himself. There, he finds things are not as wonderful as his father described since a troubled program called CLU began running things. Sam soon must go into hiding with his rediscovered dad and a lovely girl named Quorra who is more than she appears. Together, the three must plan a way to escape from the Grid and thwart CLU's dream of crossing through to the real-world and ""perfecting"" it. And what of TRON himself? Yes, he's in here too in a most surprising way.1982's TRON and 2010's TRON Legacy are now available in a variety of purchasing options. Myself, I picked up the Blu-Ray + DVD combo of each film separately. For me, this was the best way. I don't have use for digital copies, nor 3D discs, as much as I would have liked the collectible identity disc packaging, ha. I doubt it is even full-size anyway, but I'm not sure since I've never seen it in stores. Anyway, this review is for the Blu-Ray/DVD of the 2010 sequel to TRON (the Original Classic), TRON Legacy.As I said in the title of this review, this is a great sequel that surpasses the original in many ways. Not every way maybe, since one can't deny the first film's status as innovative, and groundbreaking, and all that jazz. It was a daring movie to make. Tron Legacy is a little safer, as sequels tend to be (though it's tough to really say that in this case, with TRON being a bit of an odd duck and nearly 30 years old). The story in TRON Legacy is simpler and easier to follow, I think, catering more to a wider audience, more than anything because it is less stiff and computer-geek-centric, I'd say. I imagine back when the first film came out, a lot of folks didn't know what all the computer jargon even meant. I mean, I know WE didn't have much hands on experience with computers back in `82 in MY parents' house. The outfits and light cycles and stuff still were cool through the eyes of a kid though. However, the original TRON, while I find it IS a very interesting movie with a great cast and good characters (though we only really got to know Flynn really well), is a film that one can, frankly, really fall asleep too. If you're determined to watch it, you may decide it's a pretty good movie. I think it is. But, no doubt, it takes concentration; absolutely no distractions. It's like... reading a book.  Miss a beat and you're lost. Allow yourself  to get lost, and you'll probably drift off to sleep. TRON Legacy is a different story. The visuals are far more real than the first film, which attempted to show off very primitive computer animation that wasn't actually realistic at all (but still kinda works in the world that film created). While TRON Legacy improves on character development as well as visuals, the plot is easier to understand with much livelier action, music, and fun. The emotional levels are much more present too. Yeah, you can nit-pick at some of the concepts in the film, but really, this is pure fantasy anyway, so if it's not interfering with your enjoyment and just adding to the story rather then mucking it up, why do that?  TRON Legacy is just lots of fun, full of visual eye-candy, and also loaded with lots of clever stuff for both new fans and fans of the original to appreciate. And, ya gotta love it when, nearly 30 years later, the original actors return to make a sequel probably no one in the general audience would have guessed would ever actually happen.  Yes, Jeff Bridges returns here as Kevin Flynn/Clu, Bruce Boxleitner returns as Alan Bradley/TRON,  and there is a franchise teaser on this DVD in which Dan Shor returns as RAM, in a sense, hinting that he and perhaps others may return for a third installment, which Bruce Boxleitner has already claimed to be a Go project. David Warner is suspect to be back the third time `round as well, which would be very cool, especially if Cindy Morgan is brought back as well, but I digress. Returning to the topic of Legacy, the are fresh faces on board too, including Olivia Wilde as Quorra, Garrett Hedlund as Sam Flynn, Michael Sheen, who is a highlight in the Bowie-esque roll of Castor/Zuse, Beau Garrett, another highlight in the drool-inducing roll of Gem, and Cillian Murphy doing a cameo as the son of David Warner's character, Dillinger, hinting that he will be back to play a villain in the third TRON film. Daft Punk, who provides the electronic soundtrack, also appear as D.J.s in the film.TRON Legacy is a great movie that pulls at your nostalgia-bone in particular if you have any fond memories of the 80's at all, or if you're a Disney fanatic like myself. All the stuff called back from the first film is just awesome, and that scene where Sam is checking out the arcade with Journey and the Eurythmics playing in the background is just too sweet. It's also just a great sci-fi flick with a great cast though. There is one thing I must mention, however, and I nearly forgot. There's been a lot of talk about the younger version of Kevin Flynn seen in the film. Basically, it's a CGI Jeff Bridges. Filmmakers have never learned that CGI isn't wholly perfect looking yet, especially with human characters, and it may never be. I don't have a big problem with CLU looking a little CGI since he's a digital entity anyway (though none of the others have that issue), but even I have to admit that they probably should have given a clear shot of CGI Flynn during the flashback scenes. The really clear, direct views didn't work that well. This is more a problem in the opening flashback than anywhere else. However, this does not spoil the movie for me. I hope it won't spoil this great movie for you. The Blu-Ray sadly has no commentary track, Disney's stuff rarely does, but it does have some nice behind the scenes featurettes, as well as a pretty cool Daft Punk music video with really retro TRON graphics and a cameo by Olivia Wilde, and you get the sneak peak at the upcoming TRON animated series, which is worth getting excited about with its great cast and cool visuals. ""The Next Day: Flynn Lives Revealed"" is probably the highlight bonus feature though, as it gives us a deeper look into what happened when Kevin Flynn disappeared and what happened when Sam returned. In other words, this is a cool set up for a 3rd film. I can't wait! As for the included DVD of the film, it holds the sneak peak at the animated series as well, plus two of the behind the scenes bonus features from the Blu-Ray. All in all, a nice package, but be sure to buy the original classic on Blu-ray too! In all honestly, the existence of TRON Legacy just makes the first one more interesting and easier to watch, because now you're thinking about how it led to the events of that film as well.",5,Great

Personally, I don't see what all the hype was about.  But then again, I have never seen the original.Kevin Flynn is a talented video game creator, best known for his game Tron. When he mysteriously disappears one night, he leaves behind a son who is now an orphan.  Now twenty years later, the son, Sam, isn't sure where he is headed in life.  He is bitter and disillusioned by his father and his company but then discovers a clue that may lead him to the whereabouts of his father.  In an old arcade, he discovers how his father entered the arcade ""grid"" and actually went inside the game as he too is now in the same place.  But he isn't really wanted there; an evil copy of his father is set on killing him and escaping into the real world.  But Clu, the copy, also likes playing games, and this world is one giant game.Characters:Jeff Bridges: Kevin Flynn & CluGarrett Hedlund: Sam FlynnOlivia Wilde: QuorraMichael Sheen: CastorBruce Boxleitner: Alan BradleyJames Frain: JarvisThere wasn't much development to these characters.  They could have done so much to them, yet they fit into predictable stereotypes.  Father who is really kind and generous just trapped; son who is bitter and rebellious but quickly forgiving, etc.  It just seemed like they could have thrown some non standard quirks in there and developed the relationships better.  I was surprised to find out Olivia Wilde was Quorra; I completely didn't recognize her at all.  But honestly, she was probably the best character in this movie along with Castor just because he was so odd.  Clu as the bad guy wasn't very convincing.  He just didn't seem that menacing or really much of an obstacle.The cinematography was actually well done in this movie.  There were very nice special effects and I liked the whole motif of the lights that were throughout the entire film.  That being said, I think they spent so much time on making this film look fantastic that they failed to spend as much time on the plot.  I found myself getting bored with the movie quite often and hoping that it would end soon.  Which is never a good sign.  Even the music failed to impress; indeed, I barely remember it and nothing stood out.  I think that it failed in just being blah and bland with no new plot twists or exciting moments.  Sure the games parts were exciting, but really, they were a small portion of the movie that instead was given a bunch of substandard dialogue to fill a big portion of the time.Not the best.  Yes it is visually pretty but I like more than that in the movie.  It has to have some substance to.  Stick to the original (I hear its not too shabby) and only see this if you're looking for eye candy.Review by M.

Maybe the 3D just let me down.  And that it said in the beginning of the film not all of it was to be in 3d...I don't just judge a film on just effects, but I was hoping for more.  There were some scenes to me that should have been in 3D and vise versa.  I feel the film was too black and not enough neon coloring was used to match the previous film--just a bunch of yellows and oranges....I would have liked within the story see more of Sam Flynn's father in more action scenes.With today's technology and it being a 3D film, I feel this movie could have offered more.  Maybe if the story included another ""hero"" in it (like if they added a friend to Sam in the story and had him go into the grid with him), the story make have been more interesting.

1313408,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B002ZG99QS,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[40, 58]","Tough gig, you would think, reprising a film that sank almost without trace 28 years ago. ButTronsank in heavy seas: it was released within a month of Stephen Spielberg'sE.T. - The Extra Terrestrialand a fortnight of Ridley Scott'sBlade Runner, both by common consent amongst the inner circle of all-time science fiction greatness, and against both it does seem rather a pale facsimile. Yet it does have its adherents: it picked up and kept a cult following, some of whose membership were in evidence at the London premi&egrave;re of its long awaited (by them) sequel, Tron: Legacy, still toting their original 1982 Tron tee-shirts etc. 1982's Tron did have Jeff Bridges, these days a much-loved elder statesman of dudeness even if, in 1982,The Big Lebowskiwas still a decade and a half away. In any case, it still had enough of a pulse to dare Disney to get out the CPR machine.The thing is, if anything, Tron was the visionary film of those three. William Gibson cites it as an influence for his seminal 1984 novelNeuromancer, and its parallels with theMatrixandTerminatorfranchises are plain to see. This was the direction Science Fiction was destined to take, and for all its historical consequence, E.T. didn't leave much of a legacy.Twenty eight years later, another 80s blockbuster that looms large is Back to the Future. Jeff Bridges has been remade as a digital avatar of his former self, and appears not only as the grizzled country and western singer we now know and love, but as his 35 year old alter-ego on the Grid, Clu. For the spods amongst us, that in itself is enough of a reason to turn up, and it's no surprise to hear they've done an incredible job on this. It is genuinely eerie: it's just about discernible that this is a computer regeneration, but it's hard to put a finger on how. It was enough to have me wondering whether the Screen Actor's Guild should go on strike about this, and conclude that they'd better not, because the eggheads would be able to cope without them.As is sadly de rigueur these days Tron: Legacy is in 3D, though not always: the first scenes of the film, set in real-life 1989 were not, and I opted to take my foggy little spectacles off. That I would not recommend though, because as Sam Flynn goes into the grid we are magically transported into 3D in a reveal not unlike the bursting Technicolor of the Wizard of Oz, and this is worth seeing.Still, I am sick of 3D, sick of the extortionate prices cinemas think they can charge for it, and I hope we'll get over this fad soon and go back to making good old fashioned 2D films where director concentrate on dramatic, rather than visual, extravagance.That's not to deny the importance of visual design, of course, which is so spectacular in this film that it would almost succeed on production design alone. Tron: Legacy is a truly wonderful film to look at and there were occasional breath-taking tableaux which, in my frame of reference, handsomely outdid anything the saccharine day-glo of Avatar could muster.The visual scheme is matched by the audio one. Daft Punk (who make a cameo appearance) have picked the musical vibe exquisitely: somewhere between the pulsing electronica of Jean Michel Jarre'sOxygeneand the icy square-wave soundscapes ofVangelis, but with a rocking beat. It is hard to overstate how important the soundtrack is here: I've tried and failed to get to grips with Daft Punk before, but this one puts them into a new space.So to the drama. Now there are parts of the screenplay (and Tron's, er, legacy) that aren't a million miles away from preposterous farce. Debutant director Joe Kosinski's achievement is, as the saying goes, to have the courage to change those things he can, the patience to accept those he can't, and the wisdom to know the difference. Given how seriously the film takes itself - there is absolutely no self-aware sniggering going on here of the sort you'd expect as the standard issue post-ironic response to the silly old eighties - it is all the more an achievement that Kosinski gets away with it. He's helped ineffably by Jeff Bridges, given these days to lampooning himself (in the 20 years he's been on the grid Kevin Flynn has amalgamated with The Dude, and the Dude has come out on top), and who brings some mystic, bearded Zen magic to the picture. Star Wars is visually checked on a number of occasions, not the least by Bridges' hessian hooded Alex Guinness rendition.Sure, Tron: Legacy calls to mind the Matrix, Blade Runner and Terminator (but no more than these films call to mind Tron) but somehow something more subtle is being said. Here I think we are helped, rather than hindered, by Tron's hokey original premise (being one of the facets Kosinski definitely could not change). Because the film's set up is so nonsensical and (contrary to Matrix) no time is invested in explaining it - how or why, for example, a human could wind up in a computer or why, if those MacGuffin Frisbee things are so important, it would ever be a good idea to throw them around like laser boomerangs - the viewer is left with no choice but to accept the basic resting-state absurdity of the platform and simply engage in the film itself. And this is really fun to do.It isn't perfect, then, and thereby hangs the tale: this is the very point. (Tron: Legacy repeatedly curls back on itself like this - I am still turning such things over in my mind 24 hours later). The film's moral is that striving for perfection in itself is quixotic: perfection is unknowable, unattainable, and fractal: no amount of additional detail, analysis or processing power will get you to a place which simply can't exist in the first place, and the assumption that it can - and its quest - is in itself destructive and damaging.Here, again, Tron: Legacy arcs back, reflexively on itself like a screaming lightcycle. For the grid is near perfection, but it's an empty, barren, cold and heartless place. The enhanced digital wizardry updates and supercharges the original, but never loses that anachronistic vision of the future from 1982 (in this way, really taking us back to the future). Once upon a time it seemed cool to think that the future would be all polished chrome, neon and rectangles - that dust and decay would be banished. Indeed, as a vision of the future, that takes us back further yet: for all the resemblance Tron: Legacy has to the Matrix and Terminator (and, as noted, that's a two-way street), the film whose spirit it summons most notably is Fritz Lang's Metropolis.Truly back to the future, then:  the *real* feel of the future, but as apprehended in 1982 (or even 1928): a glacial, angular, geometric dystopia of black, chrome and white neon. Nowhere is this more prominent than in the film's one moment of light relief: a cameo by British actor Michael Sheen who, having recently played Tony Blair and David Frost, seems himself to have been playing with Marty McFly's De Lorean, and has brought to the screen a white-washed character that is one part Ziggy Stardust, one part Frank-N-Furter, one part Gary Numan (and a dash of Godzilla for all the scenery he chews). It isn't entirely clear what else he's there for - there are shades of the Merovingian in him, too, come to think of it - other than to nudge the plot towards its denouement but again, there's enough going on (and he's funny enough) that it really doesn't matter.If there are false steps they are towards the end, which gravitates towards a needlessly Spielbergian apocalyptic climax which the film really doesn't need, and there was probably a spaceship dogfight too many (again, so much Star Wars), but along the way there are so many beautiful scenes, and the production design is so impressive, that I still left the theatre blown away by the whole experience. None of the other big budget sci-fis of recent times have captured the thrill of that post-Lucas ""Golden Age"" of science fiction quite like this.Olly Buxton",5,"Back To The Future, 1982 (and 1928)

It's almost an insult to the original film, which, while not a classic, at least brought up some heady subjects like the nature of reality and free will.  Tron never took itself too seriously, but it wasn't just playing around either.  It had a good mix of action, story, solid acting, and the cool visuals of what a 1980's computer network might look like.  Tron: Legacy makes some noises about being about something, but it's full of undeveloped ideas, a complete idiot plot, and, aside from the grid games in the beginning of the film, some pretty dull visuals.  The action stops for a good 2/3rds of the film while the characters explain, explain, and explain some more in an effort to make the plot make sense.  They fail.  Nothing that happens in the film makes any sense if you think about it for 5 minutes.  The only good parts of the film are the score, which really is outstanding, and the grid games that happen about 20 minutes into the movie.  Other than that, the film is 30 minutes too long, and the ending is hilariously absurd, essentially invalidating most of the ideas that came before.  It's such an empty movie.  The stakes are so low for a film that seems to think it's ""about something"", when really it seems like a cynical cash grab from Disney.  Save your money and your time.

1313412,A3500UVGFOC9PA,B002ZG99QS,Paulmeister,"[1, 2]","I've just returned from my 3rd theatrical viewing (IMAX Omni) of this film. It's a completely indescribable experience, except that I can say it appeals to my sense of aesthetics both aurally and visually in just about every way I could imagine. The only other film I can think of that even came close was The Island.This, to me, is exactly how the prequel Star Wars experience should have been. Profoundly ironic that I've always joked about Lucas' poorly conceived trilogy feeling like something concocted by Disney. A thousand apologies to Disney for those thoughts and remarks in light of what they have accomplished here. In fact, to borrow a quote, I would hope Lucas feels he just ""got dunked on"" in a big way. There are plenty of Star Wars undertones throughout, from the ominous ""emperor"" with his right hand ""sith"" assassin (who dual-wields two red discs), to Sam's ""Obi-Wan Kenobi""-like father and the lovely ""princess"" he protects, to the activation effects of the combat discs, right up to Sam's mistaking the light cycle stick for a lightsaber. Haha, that's like the icing on the cake when he does that and then Jarvis gives him that condescending look, as if to say ""no, it's not THAT"". And it definitely isn't THAT, being far greater than anything Lucas could come up with.I'm not sure how the critic reviews for this film could be a dead 50% split between positive/negative, but my guess is that those I would view as the ""dumb majority"" just do not have a proper appreciation for light, sound, and great story-telling.Speaking of light and sound, this is the closest approximation of a ""feely"" that I've ever come across. (If you don't understand that term, read Adolf Huxley). When the first Recognizer appeared on screen, the legs of my pants began literally to vibrate with the sonic intensity of it's propulsion drive as it landed. Never before have I actually felt the presence of something that was on a screen. There are many such intense scenes in this movie, to such a degree that it feels quite like a ride. The only way I would ever think of watching this film at home would be at similarly loud volume and with a minimum of 7.1 surround sound. High-quality headphones might actually be the only practical way to do this movie justice without an elaborate and expensive sound system, not to mention the risk of annoying the neighbors!Blu-ray... I'm not a fan, but this single movie leads me to greatly reconsider adding 3D Blu-ray to my entertainment setup. Perhaps one day, once 3D technology gets itself some standards established.This is not a review of the physical product, since 1) I don't yet own it, and 2) nor do I have a 3D Blu-ray disc player. However, for a modern film release you shouldn't need that kind of reassurance. If you love Tron to even a percentage of the degree that I do, simply get it. I feel slightly sorry for anyone who missed seeing it in theatres -- the best possible way by far to see this film. I say slightly in relation to the extreme amount of sadness I would have felt, had I listened to the critic reviews and not gone out that first time to see this with friends at the local IMAX 3D, only to eventually catch it on TV or DVD and realize the kind of experience I had let slip by.Anyway and in conclusion, the lack of this item's presence on my shelf cannot be remedied fast enough, but when it does it will be one of the most treasured, since it is an answer to my prayers in a way -- for it more than makes up for the disappointingly crappy prequels that George Mucus released not long enough ago, in a galaxy much much to near...",5,wow,1302912000,"04 16, 2011",2011,3600,"[""'ve"", 'just', 'returned', '3rd', 'theatrical', 'viewing', 'IMAX', 'Omni', 'film', 'completely', 'indescribable', 'experience', 'can', 'say', 'appeals', 'sense', 'aesthetics', 'aurally', 'visually', 'just', 'way', 'could', 'imagine', 'only', 'other', 'film', 'can', 'think', 'even', 'came', 'close', 'was', 'Island.This', 'exactly', 'how', 'prequel', 'Star', 'Wars', 'experience', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Profoundly', 'ironic', ""'ve"", 'always', 'joked', 'Lucas', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'trilogy', 'feeling', 'something', 'concocted', 'Disney', 'thousand', 'apologies', 'Disney', 'thoughts', 'remarks', 'light', 'what', 'have', 'accomplished', 'here', 'fact', 'borrow', 'quote', 'would', 'hope', 'Lucas', 'feels', 'just', 'got', 'dunked', 'big', 'way', 'are', 'plenty', 'Star', 'Wars', 'ominous', 'emperor', 'right', 'hand', 'sith', 'assassin', 'who', 'dual-wields', 'two', 'red', 'discs', 'Sam', 'Obi-Wan', 'Kenobi', 'father', 'lovely', 'princess', 'activation', 'effects', 'combat', 'discs', 'right', 'up', 'Sam', 'mistaking', 'light', 'cycle', 'stick', 'lightsaber', 'Haha', 'icing', 'cake', 'when', 'then', 'Jarvis', 'condescending', 'look', 'say', 'not', 'THAT', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'THAT', 'being', 'far', 'greater', 'anything', 'Lucas', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'with.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'critic', 'reviews', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'dead', '50', '%', 'split', 'positive/negative', 'guess', 'would', 'view', 'dumb', 'majority', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'proper', 'appreciation', 'light', 'sound', 'great', 'story-telling.Speaking', 'light', 'sound', 'closest', 'approximation', 'feely', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'come', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'term', 'read', 'Adolf', 'Huxley', 'When', 'first', 'Recognizer', 'appeared', 'screen', 'legs', 'pants', 'began', 'literally', 'vibrate', 'sonic', 'intensity', 'propulsion', 'drive', 'landed', 'Never', 'have', 'actually', 'felt', 'presence', 'something', 'was', 'screen', 'are', 'many', 'such', 'intense', 'scenes', 'movie', 'degree', 'quite', 'ride', 'only', 'way', 'would', 'ever', 'think', 'watching', 'film', 'home', 'would', 'be', 'similarly', 'loud', 'volume', 'minimum', '7.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'High-quality', 'headphones', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'only', 'practical', 'way', 'do', 'movie', 'justice', 'elaborate', 'expensive', 'sound', 'system', 'not', 'mention', 'risk', 'annoying', 'neighbors', 'Blu-ray', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'single', 'movie', 'greatly', 'reconsider', 'adding', '3D', 'Blu-ray', 'entertainment', 'setup', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'day', 'once', '3D', 'technology', 'standards', 'established.This', 'not', 'review', 'physical', 'product', '1', 'do', ""n't"", 'yet', 'own', '2', 'do', 'have', '3D', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'player', 'However', 'modern', 'film', 'release', 'should', ""n't"", 'need', 'kind', 'reassurance', 'love', 'Tron', 'even', 'percentage', 'degree', 'do', 'simply', 'get', 'feel', 'slightly', 'sorry', 'anyone', 'who', 'missed', 'seeing', 'theatres', 'best', 'possible', 'way', 'far', 'see', 'film', 'say', 'slightly', 'relation', 'extreme', 'amount', 'sadness', 'would', 'have', 'felt', 'had', 'listened', 'critic', 'reviews', 'not', 'gone', 'out', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'friends', 'local', 'IMAX', '3D', 'only', 'eventually', 'catch', 'TV', 'DVD', 'realize', 'kind', 'experience', 'had', 'let', 'slip', 'by.Anyway', 'conclusion', 'lack', 'item', 'presence', 'shelf', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'remedied', 'fast', 'enough', 'when', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'treasured', 'answer', 'prayers', 'way', 'more', 'up', 'disappointingly', 'crappy', 'prequels', 'George', 'Mucus', 'released', 'not', 'long', 'enough', 'ago', 'galaxy', 'much', 'much']",N/A

1313419,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B002ZG99QS,P. Hardy,"[5, 16]","Eight years ago, the closet thingTron, Disney's 1982 Pioneering Special Effects venture gone horribly wrong (or right, depending on how you watch it), ever got to a sequel was the 2003 gameTron 2.0and for all intents and purposes, it was probably a venture everybody except TRON fans were scratching their heads over. Six years later (I think), Disney releases a teaser demo of the future that would eventually become TRON: Legacy; TRON fans are ecstatic, general audiences (half of which are young enough to wonder ""what or who the heck is Tron?"") are wondering why Disney is even attempting to resurrect a non-franchise that barely gave them the desired revenue return they wanted well over two decades ago. Trepidation and excitement fills the air when the PR-machine for Legacy kicks into high gear in the early months of 2010 and before you know it, the month of December is here and everyone's geared up and ready to see the sequel.I'm intrigued, my sister's intrigued, my parents don't want to see it (they didn't like the original). I'm monitoring the movie's progress with semi-interest and when the reviews start pouring in, I read both sides of the argument with careful consideration, but figured, given the utter volume that were all saying the same thing (""worth it only to see in IMAX/3D/For the special effects, weak story/performances"") I figured that many people couldn't lie and everyone defending it to the death were seeing things through rose colored glasses. That and my mother told me the original was bad so there was no hope for this at all.""man,"" I thought. ""I wanna see this movie, but everyone says its bad."" So were the so-called ""Negative Reviews"" right about TRON: Legacy? In a nutshell, yeah, they were. Does that mean the movie wasn't enjoyable, though? No, not really.---- Our story begins with the disembodied voice of Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) narrating to his son, Sam, the tale of ""The Grid"". The digital frontier within our computers/servers that he's seemingly always dreamed of going to (despite being ""accidentally"" digitalized into it in the original film) and eventually got in. Father and Son fanboy over characters Tron and CLU [2.0] and the tale ends with a mystery that Flynn simply describes as a ""Wonderful Miracle"". Before he leaves for work, he promises to take Sam with him to the Grid one day. But, as [mis]fortune would have it, that day never comes. Kevin has mysteriously vanished into the ether, leaving his son a practical orphan (his mother died in a car crash in 1985), guardianed by his father's parents. After a moving pictures sequence that wraps parts of the backstory of pre-Legacy up in a nice little package, we flash-forward 27 years into the future. Sam has become the atypical ""rebel without a clause"", causing a ruckus in his father's fortune 500 company (ENCOM) every now and again for the hell of it, via leaking new-software onto the internet for the public (because it was meant to be FREE and sharable originally) and BASE-jumping off the EMCOM tower.He goes to jail, gets bailed out and is confronted by Alan Bradley, a mere figure head in the company since Kevin's disappearance, who tells him he got a page from his father's disconnected server at FLYNN'S [Arcade]. Sam is initially uninterested at first, playing the IDGAF-card, but ends up visiting the old arcade anyway. Next you know he's sucked into the Grid (via half-hearted digitalization sequence), but it's not how his father described it. His Doppelganger, ClU [2.0] has enslaved the system under the belief that he has brought true perfection and order to their world. When Sam escapes, he discovers Kevin has been hiding away in the outlands with a unique program named Quorra, contemplating how to bring CLU [2.0] down once and for all. Only, if they do things Kevin's way, it would mean staying within the Grid and letting the portal to the real world close for good. Naturally, thickheaded Sam decides to take the direct approach and well...things don't turn out so good for our heroes. ----Despite having low expectations in regards to the quality of the film's structure (story wise), I was really disappointed by the execution of it all. I've never seen so much NOTHING happen within the span of two hours. Absolutely nothing significant happens in the movie. At least in the original Tron, there was an objective: ""Recover Flynn's stolen idea(s) from the ENCOM system before Dillinger could erase his misdeeds from existence in the real world. Stop the MCP and Sark from taking complete control of the ENCOM mainframe in the computer world.""With Legacy, its ""Get into the Grid, Find Dad, Get out of the Grid"". That's it. It's subplots concerning the unexplained ISO's and the back-story behind everything that's shown/mentioned in flashbacks (Mrs. Flynn's death, Flynn's sudden erratic/obsessive behavior over his work, the rise and fall of the Grid, the brainwashing of Tron, Alan's suddenly unwavering faith in Flynn*, the rise of CLU [2.0]'s dictatorship, and the creation/demise of the ISO's) are practically a unshot film themselves and provide little or no substance. Legacy is in such a rush to get to the Grid, to the Disc Arena, the Light Cycle races and anything that resembles a fight or a massive special effects scene, that the movie begins to feel like it just wants to be done and over with itself. There's no patience, just rushing. Like the first film, Legacy feels too content to gloss over the things that will make you give a damn about your central character (Sam Flynn, portrayed by Garrett Hedlund) and his quest.With that said, the special effects in the movie, like the original, are the biggest focus of the production's attention. From the updated (and practical) light-suits, the manner in which characters are derezzed (aka ""killed""), to vehicles and THE GRID itself (which is a personal server belonging to Flynn, located in the bowls of his arcade), it's everything TRON couldn't be because of the limitations of the time. Long story short, it's a lovely light show without the ecstasy, acid and alcohol. If I have any complaint it's that the universe feels less like a computer generated world (it's too dark so the only thing your really looking at are the illuminated lines that make up the illusion of physical mass) and more like the world ofBlade Runnerwithout the multitude of colors and big screens with Asians selling coca cola.Jeff Bridge's youthful appearance in the movie is ugly. It's a old, bloated face pressed smooth of it's wrinkles. It doesn't resemble Jeff Bridges' in the late 1980s in any shape or form. At least not in the way it should. The eyes are devoid of emotion, the mouth moves out of sync with his words the skin looks so much like plastic it's not even funny. Those using pitiful argument that he's supposed to look like that because he's a computer program simply need to remember the opening sequence of the film to find themselves debunked.X-Men: The Last StandandTerminator Salvation(2009)'s attempt at a youthful Patrick Stewart, Ian McKelen and Arnold Schwarzenegger are better entries than this. Even better, all one has to do is rememberThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button(2008) to see what a de-aged or aged facade looks like done right. Legacy's visual effects team really dropped the ball in that area.There are plenty homages to the first film, but like any sequel without a true road of it's own to carve, it copies so much of it's processor that it really doesn't bring anything new to the table beyond the updated special effects and Daft Punk (no hoaky electric keyboard music fromWendy Carloshere). Because of this and the title card that simply says ""TRON"" and not ""TRON: Legacy"" the majority have come to consider Legacy a ""soft reboot"" of the original film.Me? I just call that plain lazy writing and a common problem that occurs in almost every sequel (whatever the medium) that's ever been made. The sequel bait, Cillian Murphy's cameo, Quorra and the ""Miracle of the ISO"" plot, practically screams that the writer's had written themselves into a corner with a idea that never made much sense to begin with. It's most likely something that will either be poorly explained (and widely accepted) or ignored completely (and pointed out constantly) if Disney gets that coveted greenlight for a Tron 3.The thing that interested me most in Tron (1982) was Flynn's uncanny ability to manipulate the digital world around him with just a touch and bring dead vehicles back to life or re-energize dying programs. Yes, it could be explained away by simply stating ""Well, he's the USER. He can do anything because he technically has complete control over the system he's in"", but I would've loved to have seen this sequel expand more on the ""how"" of it, rather than just exploiting it again and expecting the audience go along with it. That and other things I can't pinpoint without a another viewing of the film.The characters are more or less present to get you from point A to point B. The same could be said of the performances from the actors, with the exception of maybe Olivia Wilde and Bruce Boxleitner. Sam Flynn, by definition, is a character that could've been interesting in the hands of a more capable actor (maybe). As it stands, Sam is no more interesting than ""Anon"" fromTRON: Evolution. He speaks, he rebels and spits in the face of authority, sure, but it's all hollow. There's no personality or spark of life strong enough to motivate me to care for the Son of Flynn. Garrett Hedlund's linear and doldrum performance leaves me wishing I had a better protagonist (or actor) to root for.Jeff Bridges is utterly wasted in both his performance as Kevin Flynn and his facsimile, CLU [2.0]. Kevin sits (or walks around) looking morose, spouting pseudo-spiritual nonsense that doesn't sound terribly spiritual or deep. Other times he plays up the ""Dude, I'm from the 80s!"" persona a little too much. CLU [2.0] struts about, throwing out orders and smiling sinisterly at every little thing, playing computer-Hitler, but whatever potential he had as a villain is utterly squandered by the writers. But, then, I suppose that's no different from Sark via TRON, who spends most of his time glaring at screens, smacking his henchmen to the ground and getting railed on by the MCP. Neither villain amounts to anything, especially not in the final acts of either film. (But at lest Sark got a headshot death.)And while we're at it, Rinzler (a brained-washed Tron, who is believed to be dead by Flynn and most of the Grid), CLU [2.0]'s right hand man is completely unimpressive. I really expected something with the way people were going on about how ""awesome"" this character was, but in the end the most Rinzler does is cock his head, mock Darth Vader and strike a pose with his twin Identity Discs like he's in a photoshoot. It's a literal insult to even compare his character/actor to Darth Maul or Ray Park. Tron/Rinzler's body/stunt double, Anis Cheurfa, his movements are so stiff, so utterly lame, that I had to look away from the screen whenever he appeared. It's embarrassing to even think this is supposed to be Tron's villainous alter ego (especially since the body double they chose seems to be of average height verses Boxleitner's 6'2. You can see that much when he stands next to Olivia Wilde who is 5'7'). And their resolution for the character's redemption, their method of having Tron remember who he is again near the final gambit of the movie is just awful. So, yeah, people who say ""Tron really isn't in this movie"" aren't wrong. He spends most of his time under the lame guise of Rinzler, which is disappointing.Michael Sheen's Castor/Zuse is another disappointing character entry and one I thought I would like, too. He's supposed to be a two-faced character who'll play both sides to get what he wants, but without prior introduction, it just looks like he sold Sam Flynn out to CLU [2.0] without a second thought. The offhanded comment that he ""once believed in users"" as a way to validate his scheming ways really doesn't count for anything. The character is made worse when they decide to let Sheen act the fool during a fight scene that has no emotional pay-off until Quorra literally looses an arm.And while we're on her, out of everybody, Olivia Wilde stands out as the shining performer in this film (but that's not saying much). Quorra's a little like Yori (Cindy's Morgan's character and Tron's lover in the first film), only, instead of a engineer, you get a ""Marcile ISO"" who's primed for battle. She's a little naive and childlike in her comprehension of most things that aren't a dangerous situation. She's a undeniably cute character. Unfortunately, she is criminally underused in a lot of ways, not unlike Yori. Her chemistry with Hedlund works to great effect more or less because she does most of the emoting. Wilde is the one element of Legacy I expected to dislike the most, but I'm glad I was wrong.Finally, Bruce Boxleitner's performance as Alan Bradley is rather more or less a non-comment. He's not horrible in any way, he's just there. The most I can say is that I simply enjoyed his presence/performance and the strange way he almost resembles his 32-year-old self near the end of the movie when the adventure is done and over with.The main attraction for this film is undoubtedly DAFT PUNK's first motion picture score. I don't think I would've given this film a second glance if I hadn't heard they were scoring for it. In retrospect, they were the biggest part of the film's promotion and part of why the movie isn't a complete loss (aside from the ending of the film itself). Their cameo's in the movie are rather comical. They play MP3 programs who switch up the music everytime something happens. The score is quite unlike their albums (Discovery, Homework, Human After All), but there's enough of their sound and the typical orchestral elements --- that seem to hearken back to Don Davis at times --- that you'll be won over immediately. Themes like ""Derezzed"", ""C.L.U."", ""Adagio for TRON"" and ""The Game Has Changed"" truly shine among what could be a soundtrack without a single bad single on it.Overall, if there is anything I can give Legacy any credit for, it's making me give Tron (1982) a second chance, watching it and enjoying it despite the numerous flaws that usually have me going at a movie with a chainsaw or German cooking knife. Other than that, it doesn't live up to it's processor on any level, regardless of whether or not it was actually trying to. It fails simply because there were too many hands in the pot that was providing it's storyline. It introduces ideas and plots that never come to any sort of realization, the characters/actors are props for special effects.You know there's a problem when the villain's big master plan is to escape into the real world and try to take over the world,Pinky and the Brainstyle, with a army of programs and big ship that probably wouldn't even fit the screen. As if, man. [A 3 out of 5]*Yes, I know Alan, Lora and Flynn all become BFFs at the end of Tron, but their relationship never struck me as the kind that would inspire the kind of unshakable faith that Alan displays in Legacy. And if it did, this is something should've gotten a little screentime, otherwise, I'm forever rolling my eyes at this despite my affinity for strong friendships.",3,TRON: Legacy simply makes you

Based on the reviews here, I'm in the minority, because I wasn't awe-struck with Tron: Legacy, and I certainly don't feel the need to own it, or even watch it again on DVD either.The best review of this movie was this sentence by critic Bret Fetzer who wrote: ""For all the techno-babble and quasi-philosophy the characters spout, this is a movie without an idea in its shiny head.""

1313425,A2JFKSHR0WQB8C,B002ZG99QS,QuickSilverSeven,"[1, 1]","Tron Legacy the movie (which I very much enjoy) was said to be groundbreaking in visual effects moviemaking, and in many ways, it's one of a kind. But as far as groundbreaking, they may have been referring to mapping Jeff Bridges younger face to another actor, as the 3D effects are not as groundbreaking as they could've been.What is the standard for great 3D?Great 3D: In the time of 3D Polarized Glasses, great 3D could be described as an effect clear and strong enough to warrant wearing the glasses. Depth that is easily discerned and clearly visible, so the foreground pops apart from the mid and background imagery. This is achieved when the cameras are far enough apart when appropriate.Inadequate 3D:Anything that is subdued to the point where you could choose to not wear the glasses and get about the same experience, is considered average 3D. Depth that is hard to discern and closer to being flat 2D than great 3D, so the foreground is almost on the same plane as the mid and background. This is achieved when the cameras are too close to each other when a better effect could've been accomplished.Unfortunately, as much as I was rooting for Tron Legacy's 3D considering the quality of the film itself, the 3D stereographers who filmed the movie's 3D failed to take advantage of really pushing the 3D to an unmistakable level of depth, as in Avatar 3D. Tron Legacy 3D is just average 3D. At rare moments, when Sam is being scanned before he enters the games, the 3D looks great. But the rest of the 3D in Tron Legacy unfortunately remains flat, perhaps by choice of the filmmaker.Film: 4/5. Great film, story, visuals, action and much improved pacing over Tron.3D: 2/5. It's not as good as it could've been. Hopefully they get it right for Tron 3. The 3D ends up being ""Do I really need to wear these glasses when the 3D is this weak? I'll just watch 2D for this one."" And I didn't want to say that, but I'm being totally honest here. Buy the 3D version anyway, if you liked the movie and have a 3D TV. The 3D in TL is acceptable at best. If you say it's great 3D, you need to see better 3D effects to get some perspective...This review is really a call for Tron 3 filmmakers to really push the 3D envelope and not play it safe next time.

1313432,A39W3263A9HCMN,B002ZG99QS,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[0, 3]","Expectation is a funny thing. For every movie, there's different expectations. And disappointment with a movie is nothing new, as a matter of fact, those who regularly watch movies or have read movie critics would know that every critic's expectations are quite contrary to the that of the audience.In fact, those who haven't seen this movie yet, if you plan on re-living your childhood/memories of seeing the original TRON back when it came out/etc., I suggest you just watch the first TRON again. This is the new TRON. It'd dark, it's gritty, it's sexy, it's the new take on the TRON series, with a new focus, sleek and more refined visuals, and a score by Daft Punk to seal the deal that pays tribute to the original as well as with a John Carpenter influence.TRON: Legacy takes place 28 years after the original. Kevin Flynn has disappeared in 1989 after a big announcement, leaving behind a son, Sam Flynn. Cut to present day, Sam is 27 and a skilled computer hacker. After an incident, he is given the keys to the arcade, and he goes there, only to discover the computer that contains The Grid. Of course, he is transported into The Grid and is given the same task that his dad was 28 years ago- survive. That's right- light cycle, disc wars, survive it all. Except he is saved by the sexy Quorra, and is taken to where he meets his father for the first time since 1989.However, things aren't as basic as it seems. Running the Grid is CLU, the program that Flynn created, and became corrupt. This leads to the conclusion that the only things that can be done are: Terminate CLU and stop his army of programs, and get his dad out of the grid.So like the original TRON, you will either love this movie, or hate it. TRON always has been an acquired taste and TRON Legacy is no different in that aspect. I always loved the Original TRON and so I went in and threw my expectations at the door, and as a result, loved this wicked ride.This movie is glossy and pretty looking. But it is also rough, cold, gritty and broken. For every moment of brilliance, there's a moment where the viewer feels the frustration of a character, the emotion of a character, etc. The viewer is put inside the difficult mind of Sam Flynn, and that's what makes TRON: Legacy brilliant. Aside from that, great acting from Garrett Hedlund, Jeff Bridges, and a show-stealing performance from my favorite actor, James Frain as Jarvis, the right hand man of CLU. Add to that, a great performance from the sexy Olivia Wilde, who manages to mesmerize the viewer with not just her attractiveness but her real classy attitude and motivated performance.The score by Daft Punk is brilliant too. Daft Punk's music has always been blockbuster in a way- their music has always had an epic feel of a James Cameron sci-fi epic, and their score is no fifferent. It is a nice tribute to the eighties- John Carpenter would be proud. We have the classic Carpenter-esque synth, the epic Hans Zimmer feel, and overall, it is pure ear candy and perfection.The 3D is also another great touch. I love how the 3D only kicks in once we enter the Grid. It gives the movie a real human touch and as a result, the movie is more fun to watch. Avatar opened the door, TRON: Legacy tears the door down and the whole wall with it.Overall, TRON: Legacy is an overlooked masterpiece. It will not please everyone. But people will see this movie for the classic it will be one day.

1313437,A3BJDFGSLXFB36,B002ZG99QS,R. Legendre,"[2, 4]","I have always been a big fan of the original Tron, having seen it multiple times at the local theater house back in 1982, so I was psyched to see this sequel (which, I believe, is the longest time in the history of movies between an original film and it's sequel - 28 years). I did have some trepidation since many of the super-hyped films of the last decade have been consummate flops or, at the very most, ""so-so"" films.I am happy to say that ""Tron: Legacy"" does not fall into that category. The film delivers a logical sequel to its predecessor and, like it's parent film, has broken new ground in the realm of special effects. IMHO, it even gives ""Avatar"" a run for it's money in that category.So, let's start with that. Like the original ""Tron"", ""Legacy"" is incredible eye candy. I was able to see this in IMAX 3D and that is defintely the way to go. Some complain of headaches and other issues when dealing with 3D, but I found it to be a pleasurable experience (unlike other 3D films I have seen) and even a vital or necessary way to view ""Tron: Legacy"" in order to get the full effect of its rich, detailed and mind-blowing special effects. The combination of live-action and computer animation is seamless and masterfully done. The use of light and shadow was also very evident throughout the film and it definitely gives you the feeling of being immersed in ""the grid"". The combat sequences were very well done, but we get a little too much of the ""Matrix"" slow-mo dodging of bullets (or discs in this case). That kind of thing was the way to go back in 1999, but it seems so cliche now. Other than that, a very exciting experience. Also, the CGI rendering of Kevin Flynn to make him look 30-ish again was pretty damn convincing.Next seems to be the biggest problem that most of the critics had with ""Legacy"" and that is the plot. Personallly, I found the plot to be well-conceived, logical and engaging. The relationship between Sam and Kevin Flynn was well-played and gave the film biblical undertones. At one point in the film, a minor character cries out ""Behold! The son of our maker!"". I won't give away any more details than that, but you can catch the parralels between Christ and Sam Flynn with that one phrase. There are other parallels as well. Regardless, the story makes sense, continues the plot elements of the original film and is easy to follow. The film does slow up a bit and gets bogged down with the ""we have to fill you in on what happened in the past 28 years"" sequences, but then it picks right back up. There are some memorable characters (I loved the night club owner) and really good one-liners, but sadly, the film's namesake ""Tron"" is only a minor character and we barely get to see him.To sum up, ""Tron: Legacy"" delivers. The special effects are absolutely amazing, the story is engaging and the characters are memorable. This is definitely a film that you will want to see again and that, folks, is why we go to the movies.",4,How much has changed in 28 years,1293408000,"12 27, 2010",2010,2964,"['have', 'always', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'original', 'Tron', 'having', 'seen', 'multiple', 'times', 'local', 'theater', 'house', 'back', '1982', 'was', 'psyched', 'see', 'sequel', 'believe', 'longest', 'time', 'history', 'movies', 'original', 'film', 'sequel', '28', 'years', 'did', 'have', 'trepidation', 'many', 'super-hyped', 'films', 'last', 'decade', 'have', 'been', 'consummate', 'flops', 'very', 'most', 'so-so', 'films.I', 'am', 'happy', 'say', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'not', 'fall', 'category', 'film', 'logical', 'sequel', 'predecessor', 'parent', 'film', 'broken', 'new', 'ground', 'realm', 'special', 'effects', 'IMHO', 'even', 'Avatar', 'run', 'money', 'category.So', 'let', 'start', 'original', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'incredible', 'eye', 'candy', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'IMAX', '3D', 'defintely', 'way', 'go', 'complain', 'headaches', 'other', 'issues', 'when', 'dealing', '3D', 'found', 'be', 'pleasurable', 'experience', 'other', '3D', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'even', 'vital', 'necessary', 'way', 'view', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'order', 'get', 'full', 'effect', 'rich', 'detailed', 'mind-blowing', 'special', 'effects', 'combination', 'live-action', 'computer', 'animation', 'seamless', 'masterfully', 'done', 'use', 'light', 'shadow', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'evident', 'film', 'definitely', 'feeling', 'being', 'immersed', 'grid', 'combat', 'sequences', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'get', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'Matrix', 'slow-mo', 'dodging', 'bullets', 'discs', 'case', 'kind', 'thing', 'was', 'way', 'go', 'back', '1999', 'so', 'cliche', 'now', 'Other', 'very', 'exciting', 'experience', 'Also', 'CGI', 'rendering', 'Kevin', 'Flynn', 'make', 'look', '30-ish', 'again', 'was', 'pretty', 'damn', 'convincing.Next', 'be', 'biggest', 'problem', 'most', 'critics', 'had', 'Legacy', 'plot', 'Personallly', 'found', 'plot', 'be', 'well-conceived', 'logical', 'engaging', 'relationship', 'Sam', 'Kevin', 'Flynn', 'was', 'well-played', 'gave', 'film', 'biblical', 'undertones', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'minor', 'character', 'out', 'Behold', 'son', 'maker', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'more', 'details', 'can', 'catch', 'parralels', 'Christ', 'Sam', 'Flynn', 'one', 'phrase', 'are', 'other', 'parallels', 'well', 'Regardless', 'story', 'sense', 'plot', 'elements', 'original', 'film', 'easy', 'follow', 'film', 'slow', 'up', 'bit', 'bogged', 'down', 'have', 'fill', 'what', 'happened', 'past', '28', 'years', 'sequences', 'then', 'right', 'back', 'up', 'are', 'memorable', 'characters', 'loved', 'night', 'club', 'owner', 'really', 'good', 'one-liners', 'sadly', 'film', 'namesake', 'Tron', 'only', 'minor', 'character', 'barely', 'get', 'see', 'him.To', 'sum', 'up', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'delivers', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'story', 'engaging', 'characters', 'are', 'memorable', 'definitely', 'film', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'folks', 'why', 'go', 'movies']",N/A

1313440,AE31M52VLKOG6,B002ZG99QS,Robert G Yokoyama,"[3, 7]",Tron Legacy is a visually dazzling movie with excellent music and an easy to follow plot. I recommend the movie for these reasons. Jeff Bridges reprises his role as Kevin Flynn. He also plays the evil Clu. Clu is a computer program that looks exactly It is interesting to see Jeff Bridges play both characters. The plot is simple. Flynn has been trapped in a digital world for twenty plus years. He has a son named Sam who finds his long lost father and tries to get him out of this virtual world. I love the visual effects of the movie. The light cycle races are neat to watch and so is the light jet.  Another scene that I liked watching involved Garrett Hedhund being stripped of his clothes with one finger and instantly clad in a black body suit. I also love watching the light disc battles in the film. Daft Punk is a music group that scores the film. They provide the movie with a pulsating techno sound that I like very much.  There are also classic songs by Journey and The Eurythmics played in the movie too.  These songs still sound great The lovely actress Olivia Wilde plays Quorra.

1313441,AVYHQVH6XYOF2,B002ZG99QS,Robin,"[12, 16]","I have been a fan of the original 1982 TRON since I was a kid. Both my parents worked in the satellite and computer field, and, at its heart, TRON is about a Kevin Flynn's journey into a fantastical world, albeit one of circuits and bits. This being said, it's my kind of movie, dated technology and all, and there is no way for me to go into seeing TRON: Legacy without a biased perspective.The initial idea of a sequel, followed by the first teaser trailer released looked fabulous; I pounced on it and couldn't stop thinking about it from the moment I saw it. I was so impressed with how they managed to get such a wonderful blend of the old school style from the original, mixed with the modern sensibilities of our current computer age. When I first saw the newly-designed Recognizer float down out of the sky, my heart skipped several beats. The numerous articles written about the film implied an incredible amount of work having gone into making the film and the extended trailers continued to look just as amazing as the first; even better.And on that note, I suppose, the film managed to deliver. The look of the film is, by far, its strongest quality (except, perhaps, for Daft Punk's ingenious musical score). The story,  however, leaves something to be desired. Several somethingsWhen I first viewed the film, I was left feeling deflated and slightly heartbroken. The ending pushed all the film's other pros aside; I wasn't sure if I'd ever see it again, even for the visuals.I have, however, gone back and seen it twice since. I have come to appreciate it more with each viewing, but I'm still left disappointed by the time the end credits roll.Visually, it was everything I could have hoped for, dreamed of, ever thought possible. Absolutely fantastic. It was beyond amazing to see those images, those concepts come to life in ways that the original couldn't, because of the restrictions in technology and filmmaking of the time. Still, the original film set those ideas in motion and to see them executed in the ways that Legacy was able to do was a dream come true. The Light Cycles, the Disc Games and, again, for me, personally, the eloquent appearance and flight of the Recognizers.But for all the effort the filmmakers supposedly put into the screenplay, it doesn't seem to be there. The story is clich&eacute;, predictable, and, at times, paradoxically over-achieving.  The film is an ""Alice in wonderland"" type plot, it didn't need the earth-shattering subplot of the miraculous new life form.  Going into the computer and finding a living,  breathing world was earth-shattering enough and could have been, all on its own, in this sequel, from the perspective of Sam Flynn, Kevin's son. The religious subtext, too, was unnecessary.  Not wholly inappropriate (since any artist can relate to the idea of one's ideas and creations becoming their own entities) but sometimes it felt almost preachy (""there, standing over me, was the Creator..."" and, ""behold! the son of our Maker!""). They could have played with these ideals in a different way, more the way they did in the original film, with this debate of whether or not the Users are real, or if that predetermines them to a specific life or fate (a theme right out of Alice Through the Looking Glass).There's no mention whatsoever of who Kevin Flynn married, or what happened to Laura and/or Yuri (the female programmer and program from the first film, played by Cindy Morgan).I also feel that, by having Flynn get stuck inside the Grid in the 1980's, it restricted the story from utilizing any of the concepts or developments that have come along in the last 22 years (since the film's opening in 1989). What was the point of updating the story to modern times, then? Plus, the original Grid was not a ""world,"" with buildings, restaurants, etc., nor was there a game called TRON; Tron was the program, not a game. The game was called Space Paranoids. I realize that it's an adaptation for the new film, for a new generation, but they never really explain what this TRON game is; every bit of the ""Tron Game"" that we saw were Light Cycles and Disc Wars; so what is it? And what was the point? Too, the very idea of Light Cycles, Disc Battles, Recognizers, etc., didn't necessarily make sense. Why would Clu 2.0 have reinvented these things, exactly as they were before?But my biggest gripe with the film, as I've mentioned, is the way they chose to end it, and here's why.(SPOILERS AHEAD)My favorite character in the TRON universe is Tron himself. He's my favorite part of the original film; him and Flynn meeting and taking down the Master Control Program together. But Tron, the character, was one of the things I loved most about the film and the story; I liked how he resembles Alan, but they're really two different characters (which I thought was impressive from an acting standpoint on the part of Bruce Boxleitner, who played both roles). My expectation for the new film, given the publicity surrounding it, was that Tron was going to either be completely ignored or only included as a bit part, without much involvement. After all, the trailers, commercials, posters, etc., don't even MENTION him at all, despite the title of the film itself. I thought, on a more specific note, that Tron would have been killed or buried or something, and that the mission would involve - at least partly - finding him (along with Flynn) and bringing him back to life, which, given how the film went, I would much rather have seen; it would have been a more interesting story. Hell, they could have gone with a ""King Arthur"" sort of subtext and it would have worked.In a way, that's sort of what happened, though. Clu re-programs Tron to become a faceless, evil henchman, complete with the red-coloring and a helmet that hides his face. They tried to fool the audience by not telling you until much later in the film that that's who Tron is, but it's incredibly easy to figure out pretty early on. At least I wondered if it was him almost as soon as I saw him. I was looking for him, though; almost as soon as Sam Flynn entered the computer universe I was thinking, where's Tron? Where's Tron? I wonder if that's Tron... So I picked up on it pretty quickly. We get to see Tron's face in flashbacks; a young Bruce Boxleitner's face, via the same tech used to make a young Jeff Bridges' face for young Kevin Flynn and Clu. And it's pretty amazing, honestly. It really was Tron. (Likely, in part, because Boxleitner aged really well.) But you never see his face again, throughout the rest of the film. That bothered me. I kept waiting for him to take a more active role. He's just been re-programed; brainwashed so to speak, and it seemed off, a cheap way to have him involved. Knowing the back-story from the original, too, I find it a little hard to believe that Clu could just simply overtake Tron. Tron was the bigger program, with a specific purpose, more suited to take out threats than Clu; he was written as a security program by Alan, after all.At the end of the film, Tron ""pulls Darth Vader."" They're all in the middle of this air battle, and Tron's coming after them, as he's done the whole movie as Clu's top henchman. But Flynn makes eye contact with him (through the helmet, I'm guessing) and just says his name, ""Tron..."" and Tron, still decked in the red coloring, seems to recall his own memory of the flashback we saw earlier, when he said, ""Flynn, go!"" as he was fighting off Clu and his cronies. He shakes his head, but then seems to have a full change of heart and turns his vehicle to intersect with Clu's. Just before he throws the vehicle forward for impact, we hear him say, ""I fight for the Users."" It's a classic line from the original, and I loved hearing it, but as they crashed, and both Tron and Clu went spiraling down into the Sea, I was horrified, thinking that Tron had gotten the axe for good. Then they showed him falling in the sea, and his suit returns to the blue tones. And that, boys and girls, is the last we see of him in the film.The real killer thing, though, is that, on top of already having lost Tron at that point, Flynn defeats Clu by merging to two of them together and causing a massive explosion throughout the Grid, destroying everything - including himself - while Sam and Quorra escape back through the portal, into our world.It just seemed cruel and unnecessary, to lose them both. I would have rather have seen Sam get stuck there than Kevin. I realize that it's largely due to the filmmakers' attempting to bring the whole of the story into a modern context, to a new audience, to the younger generation, but, at the same time, it's just completely heart wrenching for anyone who has followed the original and loved it for years. Honestly, I don't care about Sam and Quorra. The film did not manage to successfully create new characters that match the originals. I thought that Olivia Wilde's performance was enjoyable and thorough, but I was not especially impressed with Garrett Hedlund. The last few minutes of the movie, all about them, just seemed useless. I respected the fact that they didn't have some big, romantic kissing scene at the end, but otherwise, I just didn't care what happened to them. The two cornerstones of the story, the universe, were gone.Again, it just seems that, considering the title is TRON, he, as a character, gets terribly underplayed in this film; so under-appreciated and often flat-out ignored. That makes me sad, because, as I said, he's my favorite character and I wanted to see him around more. I think his participation in the story as a hero would have actually helped the newer audiences fully understand WHY the thing is called TRON to begin with.I have heard the various theories floating around regarding the supposed third film that is being planned; i.e. that the whole system will be examined with a fine-tooth comb and that the mission will be to help bring Flynn back to life, along with Tron. One of my friends even predicted that, next time, Alan may have to go back in with Sam. If they chose to follow that route, then I'm all for it, because, in that case, maybe Tron and Alan will come face to face. They communicate in the original film, but only Tron experiences it as a conversation; to Alan, it's just a command code or mission. So if they actually met in person, like Clu and Flynn did in this one, how AMAZING would that be?As a writer, filmmaker and a fan, all I really care about is bringing back Flynn and Tron. Save them. Save Tron, save the world.",2,A Legacy Shattered,1302393600,"04 10, 2011",2011,10541,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'original', '1982', 'TRON', 'was', 'kid', 'parents', 'worked', 'satellite', 'computer',

1313442,AVMAHVWDGNOKK,B002ZG99QS,Rock~N~Rolla,"[0, 0]","The original Tron movie is one of my all-time most favorite movies ever. I saw the original Tron movie on the big screen back in 1982 and I was really wowed by it. Here was a movie about a young computer programmer and video game designer named Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) who gets trapped inside of a computer world and must survive against his very own creations. How cool is that for a movie storyline? Plus, I could really relate to this movie because back in those days I used to go to the video game arcade all of the time. In fact, in the same shopping center where I first saw Tron, there was also a video game parlor located there named Time Zone Arcade where I spent a lot of Friday evenings playing the newest video games before going to see the latest movies.  Even now, 28 years later at the theater where I watched Tron:Legacy this last December, I played Ms. Pac Man, and Galaga in the theaters game section just before seeing the movie. It was like Deja Vu. Anyway, I absolutely loved the new Tron: Legacy movie. It was everything that the first movie was and so much more.To think that some 28 odd years later after the release of the first Tron and here I was seeing a big-budget sequel on the big screen featuring the return of two of its original stars, Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner and, well...Wow, I practically had to pinch myself to see if I was dreaming. I never would have thought that there would ever be a sequel made to this movie in my wildest dreams. During its theater run I managed to see Tron: Legacy 4 times, twice in 3D, and twice the regular version, and I would have seen it at least a couple more times if I could have. This movie is awesome and really entertains you. It is films such as this one that I go to movie theaters for in the first place, to see big, epic, larger-than-life action adventure movies loaded with wild and interesting characters, great action sequences, spectacular special effects, and lots of fun, and this movie delivered all of that and more in Spades.The only negative that I can give the film is that I did not think the 3D looked all that impressive. Of course I only saw this movie in a regular theater, I did not see it in IMAX, which I have heard the 3D looked much better in IMAX. But I digress, this review is not about the 3D Blu-Ray DVD, only the standard Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack of which I own. EDIT: As of 12-17-2011 I am now the proud owner of the 3D Blu ray version of the film and let me tell you, it looks absolutely stunning! I really was surprised at how so much better the 3D in this movie looks at home. If you are considering obtaining the 3D version of this film, do not hesitate. It looks very impressive.But, besides all of that, this movie still rocks whether viewed in 3D or not. All I can say is if you enjoy big epic Sci Fi action adventure movies as much as I do then you should definitely see this film. Trust me, they do not get much bigger or more epic than this.",5,An excellent sequel to a great classic film!,1302480000,"04 11, 2011",2011,2965,"['original', 'Tron', 'movie', 'one', 'all-time', 'most', 'favorite', 'movies', 'ever', 'saw', 'original', 'Tron', 'movie', 'big', 'screen', 'back', '1982', 'was', 'really', 'wowed', 'Here', 'was', 'movie', 'young', 'computer', 'programmer', 'video', 'game', 'designer', 'named', 'Kevin', 'Flynn', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'who', 'trapped', 'computer', 'world', 'must', 'survive', 'very', 'own', 'creations', 'How', 'cool', 'movie', 'storyline', 'could', 'really', 'relate', 'movie', 'back', 'days', 'used', 'go', 'video', 'game', 'arcade', 'time', 'fact', 'same', 'shopping', 'center', 'where', 'first', 'saw', 'Tron', 'was', 'also', 'video', 'game', 'parlor', 'located', 'there', 'named', 'Time', 'Zone', 'Arcade', 'where', 'spent', 'lot', 'Friday', 'evenings', 'playing', 'newest', 'video', 'games', 'before', 'going', 'see', 'latest', 'movies', 'Even', 'now', '28', 'years', 'later', 'theater', 'where', 'watched', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'last', 'December', 'played', 'Ms.', 'Pac', 'Man', 'Galaga', 'theaters', 'game', 'section', 'just', 'seeing', 'movie', 'was', 'Deja', 'Vu', 'Anyway', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'new', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'movie', 'was', 'everything', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'more.To', 'think', '28', 'odd', 'years', 'later', 'release', 'first', 'Tron', 'here', 'was', 'seeing', 'big-budget', 'sequel', 'big', 'screen', 'featuring', 'return', 'two', 'original', 'stars', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Bruce', 'Boxleitner', 'well', 'Wow', 'practically', 'had', 'pinch', 'see', 'was', 'dreaming', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'would', 'ever', 'be', 'sequel', 'made', 'movie', 'wildest', 'dreams', 'theater', 'run', 'managed', 'see', 'Tron', 'Legacy', '4', 'times', 'twice', '3D', 'twice', 'regular', 'version', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'least', 'couple', 'more', 'times', 'could', 'have', 'movie', 'awesome', 'really', 'films', 'such', 'one', 'go', 'movie', 'theaters', 'first', 'place', 'see', 'big', 'epic', 'larger-than-life', 'action', 'adventure', 'movies', 'loaded', 'wild', 'interesting', 'characters', 'great', 'action', 'sequences', 'spectacular', 'special', 'effects', 'lots', 'fun', 'movie', 'delivered', 'more', 'Spades.The', 'only', 'negative', 'can', 'give', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'think', '3D', 'looked', 'impressive', 'course', 'only', 'saw', 'movie', 'regular', 'theater', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'IMAX', 'have', 'heard', '3D', 'looked', 'much', 'better', 'IMAX', 'digress', 'review', 'not', '3D', 'Blu-Ray', 'DVD', 'only', 'standard', 'Blu-Ray/DVD', 'combo', 'pack', 'own', 'EDIT', '12-17-2011', 'am', 'now', 'proud', 'owner', '3D', 'Blu', 'ray', 'version', 'film', 'let', 'tell', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'really', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'so', 'much', 'better', '3D', 'movie', 'home', 'are', 'considering', 'obtaining', '3D', 'version', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'hesitate', 'very', 'impressive.But', 'movie', 'still', 'viewed', '3D', 'not', 'can', 'say', 'enjoy', 'big', 'epic', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'action', 'adventure', 'movies', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'then', 'should', 'definitely', 'see', 'film', 'Trust', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'much', 'bigger', 'more', 'epic']",N/A
1313443,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B002ZG99QS,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 3]","***1/2Although the original ""Tron"" was a somewhat inexplicable box office failure when it was released in 1982, the film still managed to enter sci-fi lore as a prescient and visionary work that both exploited our then-burgeoning obsession with cybernetics and paved the way for the CGI era of moviemaking that was to come.  All of which means that any modern remake of the film is going to have to seem just as cutting-edge as the original in a time when eye-popping computer-generated special effects have become the rule rather than the exception - no easy task given the quality of its competition.  Now that technology has caught up with ""Tron,"" the question must be asked, can a new version of the film still manage to outpace the technology of its own time and present something never before seen at the local cineplex?Well, the answer is, it doesn't quite do so, but that doesn't keep the movie from being moderately entertaining on its own terms anyway.  While retaining the neon-lit visual schema of the original film, director Joseph Kosinski's ""Tron: Legacy"" does manage to ramp up the special effects with modern CGI technology - with a heavy emphasis on layered planes and geometric shapes to give this virtual world a circuit board look and feel.  The mood is also enhanced by the electronics-based score of Daft Punk.The story is essentially the same, as a human finds himself drawn into a video game and fighting for his life against the cybernetic forces that reside therein.  In this case, the human is Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund), the twenty-seven-year-old son of Kevin Flynn, the man who invented the game (played by Jeff Bridges, the star of the original film) and who disappeared under mysterious circumstances in 1989 when Sam was still a lad.

There is only 2 good things about this movie, light bikes and a hot girl in black latex. That's it. The rest of the movie blows. And it amazes me that anyone would give this movie a positive review. So Sam is the major shareholder of the company Encom but yet, he has to break into his own company to play a prank once a year? Why? It's his company! And it would appears this billion dollar company can only hire one security guard? Who has to run all the way up to try and catch the owner breaking into his own company? Stupid! And either the actor Garrett Heglund or maybe the script was written this way, but he acts like a boring, unemotional d-bag through the whole movie. Sam doesn't seem to be that surprised when he enters a virtual world and just so happens to be BA with a disc. Okay, whatever. Now Kevin Flynn is hiding out in this virtual world but off grid with real world items, such as books, and eating green beans? Huh? You don't need to eat in this world! And where did the books come from and why did Kevin bring them in. And if he's hold up off the grid, how come Clu can later just fly out to this hide out? Why hasn't Clu never went looking for Kevin out in this region before. Who knows!? And it was lame how Tron who had been reprogrammed to a bad guy, just so happens to defend the good guys at the most convenient time. And how about that long time delay, when Clu decides to kill Zeus or whatever his name is with planted explosives in the techno-bar and it doesn't explode for like five minutes. Why doesn't the Zeus guy just escape? Oh yeah, and another stupid thing, when Sam is fighting Tron(dual disc guy) and Sam gets cut on his arm and bleeds! Hello!, this is a virtual computer world, you are not flesh and blood here! So how can he bleed at all? And the idea is given that Clu wants to come to the real world along with his bat armed army and take over the world. Ha! Ha! Why fear this at all? How are these losers going to go up against a real world military? Clu would be wiped out in no time.

First, did Disney, the litigiousest place on earth, recognize itself as Encom, the high tech firm shown introducing its heavily rights-managed software to the world? And second, in a nod to the film's theme, is the horrifying CGI young Jeff Bridges a comment on the inability of computing systems to render ""imperfect"" humans?Tron Legacy seems to be assembled out of separate component parts that don't quite fit. On the one hand, there is the story that tries to be a meditation on father/son relationships, and the nature of digital systems. Then there is the direction, in which Joseph Kosinski's greatest concern seems to have been making sure that underwear lines aren't visible. Then there are the actors who seem to be fending for themselves, never sure what's happening around them and why. The effect is like watching a music video in which distant, hazy memories of Willy Wonka, Star Wars and the original Tron are remixed with a special issue of Dwell.Kosinsky knows how to make a sexy Elite model of a film that yearns to be ogled. Yet, the requirements of narrative film are such that there needs to be emotional and thematic engagement. So the father/son relationship and the ""what is perfection?"" theme are grafted on via endless exposition. The end result is more like watching an experiment in implantation than drama, perhaps fitting for a film about technology.",3,Components that don't fit,1293408000,"12 27, 2010",2010,1467,"['Watching', 'beginning', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'bracketing', 'out', 'two', 'prospective', 'ironies', 'First', 'did', 'Disney', 'litigiousest', 'place', 'earth', 'recognize', 'Encom', 'high', 'tech', 'firm', 'shown', 'introducing', 'heavily', 'rights-managed', 'software', 'world', 'second', 'nod', 'film', 'theme', 'horrifying', 'CGI', 'young', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'comment', 'inability', 'computing', 'systems', 'render', 'imperfect', 'humans', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'be', 'assembled', 'separate', 'component', 'parts', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'one', 'hand', 'story', 'be', 'meditation', 'father/son', 'relationships', 'nature', 'digital', 'systems', 'Then', 'direction', 'Joseph', 'Kosinski', 'greatest', 'concern', 'have', 'been', 'making', 'sure', 'underwear', 'lines', 'are', ""n't"", 'visible', 'Then', 'are', 'actors', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'fending', 'never', 'sure', 'what', 'happening', 'why', 'effect', 'watching', 'music', 'video', 'distant', 'hazy', 'memories', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Star', 'Wars', 'original', 'Tron', 'are', 'remixed', 'special', 'issue', 'Dwell.Kosinsky', 'how', 'make', 'sexy', 'Elite', 'model', 'film', 'be', 'ogled', 'requirements', 'narrative', 'film', 'are', 'such', 'be', 'emotional', 'thematic', 'engagement', 'father/son', 'relationship', 'what', 'perfection', 'theme', 'are', 'grafted', 'endless', 'exposition', 'end', 'result', 'more', 'watching', 'experiment', 'implantation', 'drama', 'perhaps', 'fitting', 'film', 'technology']",N/A

The Blu-Ray quality is excellent.  I gave it four stars rather than five because this sequel is a little muddy in the plot department.

In this sequel, the father and son programmers do have some power beyond other programs in the computer but it's inconsistent and not as strong as one would expect.

1313474,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,B002ZG99QS,"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time""","[455, 575]","""Greetings, programs!""It was a long time coming, but the wait was worth it. While theatrical sequels to The Last Starfighter and War Games may or may not come out in the near future, and I am left hoping and praying for big-screen adaptations of Isaac Asimov's Foundation Series and Doc Smith's Lenman Series...Tron Legacy is here now (in glorious 3D) courtesy of Disney. I saw it on opening night in 3D with a huge box of kettle corn, a large group of friends...and I was first in line for the showing. Naturally my expectations were high.The GridTo be sure, this movie is visually and audibly stunning in every way. Everyone who was tantalized by the trailers and got excited by the visuals will NOT be disappointed with the art design or special effects. As they were leaving the showing before us, many people had neither a positive nor a negative expression on their face. They simply looked...stunned. Shocked. Out of it. And after seeing the movie I think I understand why.This must be what it felt like to see Star Wars the first time in 1977. Seeing Tron Legacy (especially without seeing the first Tron) is like being transported to an alien planet through an inter-dimensional gateway. There simply has never been anything like this on the big-screen in history. The film cost 170 million according to box office records I read online, and you can see where the money went.The computer world is literally a city of light. The first time you see it, it takes your breath away. The action sequences featuring light cycles, flying discs, and various flying vehicles are some of the most amazing ever captured. From the moment I saw the visuals that became the film's logo I knew the visual style of this film was spot on and I was going to love it.The Game Has ChangedWhen you compare this movie to the first Tron, it's a MAJOR upgrade in just about every way (the one area I think it's inferior is the acting not quite on the same level). The dorky outfits of the first movie have been replaced with the new skin-tight outfits with glowing edges, the discs no longer look like ceramic Frisbees, the light cycles can make curved turns, ect. In truth, this was something I was worried about when I first saw the previews. It seemed to break from the feel of the first Tron film too much. But now...This is how i feel about the overall feel of Tron Legacy compared to the first: I have seen many animated TV shows that were then made into feature films, and you almost always have the same feeling that characters were changed around, and usually some past events were totally re-written. In a good movie adaptation the essence is maintained but the experience is different (like an alternate telling or a what if?). Thus, while Tron Legacy breaks from many of the traditions of Tron  (digital people now look much more like real people, real food exists in the Grid instead of just energy), at its heart it is a continuation of the story, characters, and world you have grown to love.Flynn LivesYes, at its heart, this is the same world you loved when you saw the first Tron, with the same features and flaws. The first Tron was a visual masterpiece with unique music and visual flair, a simple but deep plot, and characters you grew to love on an age-old but engrossing quest to save the computer world and along with it the real world. This film is no different in these fundamentals. The visuals are amazing, the music is astounding, and the main plot is almost identical to the first movie (get out of system, defeat the evil program who rules the computer world with an iron fist).The now older Kevin Flynn who was trapped in the digital world is no less likable, but expectedly changed as anyone would be after decades spent inside a computer. His son Sam is the kind of guy you immediately like. He's rich but not snobby, attractive but not superficial, a good guy but maybe just lacking some purpose and direction in his life. At any rate, he makes a great protagonist. Jeff Bridges is a bit subdued compared to his other roles lately, but his whacky zen charm still makes him fun to watch. His digital younger (flashback and arch-nemesis) self does not fare as well because while a digital world evil Jeff Bridges that feels a bit unnatural is no problem, when it's supposed to be Kevin Flynn in the past it just comes off as strangely artificial.Probably the first thing everyone noticed from the trailer besides the light cycles was Olivia Wilde's character Quorra. She manages to be beautiful, innocent, courageous, loyal, child-like, fierce, and in all other ways awesome for the duration of the film. Her acting is flawless. Michael Sheen is totally over-the-top in a role that people will probably either love or hate, and Beau Garrett's Gem and Cillian Murphy's Dillinger will have you wishing they had larger roles. And of course there is one surprise I wasn't expecting regarding an old favorite character. But let's not kid ourselves...the real star of this movie is...the soundtrack!DerezzedThe soundtrack...to Tron...is one of the greatest soundtracks in history. Please understand, I do not use these terms to describe a soundtrack lightly. My favorite kind of music to listen to is orchestral movie and TV music. From anime soundtracks like Vision of Escaflowne and Magic Knight Rayearth to under-rated scores like A.I. and the New World, I am a HUGE fan of orchestral tracks. I have literally hundreds of movie themes performed by the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. I listen to the Star Wars soundtrack from beginning to end. I even recently wrote the Prague Philharmonic an email requesting that they record music on my wish list. That is to say...I take movie musical scores SERIOUSLY.You should know that I am a fan of Daft Punk's album Discovery. Look it up on Amazon and you'll see my ecstatic review. Some people have unfairly criticized the soundtrack for Tron Legacy, simply because what they wanted was another Daft Punk album, another Discovery. This is NOT a Daft Punk album. This is a FILM SCORE, featuring a full orchestra in addition to the electronic wizardry of Daft Punk. And it is destined to become legendary. From the first moments of the film when the main theme kicked in I was blown away by the music, but there is much more to it than just that the music is phenomenal.I would say that from 60 to 75 percent of the brilliance of this movie is the film score, and the reason for that is that the film was actually CUT to the film score, rather than the score being cut to the film. What this means, is that the film and its music are almost perfectly synchronized. Anyone who has watched a really good AMV on the Internet has seen the magic that happen when you cut the action to the music and it works magic in this film. The disc battles, light-cycle sequences, and chase scenes and fight scenes (Derezzed being the stand-out) are incredible because of how the music not only fits, but drives these scenes. And when the epic climax of the movie rolls around the music makes it a hundred times better because it is brilliant, and it is so loud, so strong, so appropriate, and so flat-out amazing that it just makes everything WORK. Some have said that they listened to the music on its own in order to more fully appreciate it. I say the opposite. See the movie to appreciate how the music was MEANT to be used. Awesome.The CreatorSome critics and others might dismiss Tron Legacy as a simple candy-coated popcorn flick with all the depth of Super-Bowl commercial. ""Tron Legacy isn't actually trying to be smart""? You have got to be kidding me. But then again...people said EXACTLY the same thing when the first Tron came out, and when the Matrix movie came out as well. I'm starting to think that every time someone says a movie has no plot what they really mean is ""I didn't understand it.""This movie is NOT simplistic. The spiritual overtones of Tron once again are pronounced. Love them or hate them, they are what drive this story, not the basic premise of the plot. In the first Tron the Users were seen as gods, the ones who had a plan for everything, the great beings who watched over the Grid with benevolence. When Tron was given a mission by his User, it was akin to pulling The Sword From The Stone or learning to Use The Force. Likewise, Kevin Flynn's User powers are seen from time to time, making him seem like a sort of mythological wizard (Merlyn, Gandalf, or better yet Obi-Wan Kenobi from Star Wars: A New Hope). When the creatures of his self-created Grid turn on him we cannot help but see an allusion to our own world where in films and popular culture everyone sees to be angry at God despite the fact that he made them. This spiritual metaphor does not come off as silly or cheesy (at least in my opinion) but rather lends significant gravity to an otherwise straightforward plot.There you have it. The new Tron is an amazing film in just about every way. Not perfect, but definitely the best movie to come out in years. The 3D is nice, but not required, as it is not quite up to the par of Alice in Wonderland and Avatar. It would be better to see this film on a digital screen where the wonders of the world of the Grid can really shimmer and pop off the screen in razor sharp detail (the icing on the cake would be digital 3D). I've seen it multiple times in the theater. You should do the same. This one movie you do not want to rent and watch on a tiny TV for your first viewing. You want to see it on the big screen. And then buy the Blu Ray and watch it on your home theater. This is one movie that would show off a high-def setup in spectacular fashion.",5,"""I Fight For The USERS!!!!!!!!""",1293062400,"12 23, 2010",2010,9640,"['Greetings', 'programs', 'was', 'long',

The movie immediately feels like the antidote to every bad Pixar film you had to sit through while you were wondering what happened to Disney.Let me emphasize again, the movie is great.  It has several clever curves thrown at you to take you off guard.  When entering the new grid, the visual style is spectacular, indeed the CGI itself plays into the Tron conceptual world with astonishing effect because IT IS a CGI computer landscape.Just when you think things couldn't get any better, it does.  Because Tron Legacy is far more mature and philosophical than the original movie.  Yes, there is a Matrix level very clever narrative here involving Flynn and Clu.  Let's just say that by the end of the movie you'll be looking at Sam Flynn like he's Angel Gabriel helping to clean up what Clu did.  The action scenes are freaking cool, it's about as good as it could ever get, rivaling scenes in Macross Plus.  As an added bonus, the tremendous electronic soundtrack is performed by Daft Punk!!

In 1982, I originally viewed this film in my local theater, and found it to be a great visual experience on the big movie theater screen.  I remembered that TRON's Reality-to-Cyberspace concept was a bit far-fetched (and I should be a bit more tolerant of this type of concept since I'm a Sci-Fi / now, retired IT guy). I also found the pacing was a bit Slow and Boring in a few spots.  To give this new film a fair review, I re-watched my original TRON DVD through my YT-V3D-P 2D-3D Converter in my home theater, and once again, I found TRON was Still a bit Slow and Boring in a few spots.  However, the 2D-3D Conversion on a large screen did draw me into the film better.  I found the film to be pioneering in its CGI effects, which were ground-breaking in 1982.  The New TRON: Legacy which Much more geared to Live-Action 3D, with better plot and character development. The 3D and the updated live / CGI'd set design were visually more interesting (although I missed the color scheme of the original TRON, which I liked better). Kudos to the cast and crew who were able to work with better material than the first TRON. I found TRON: Legacy to be generally more enjoyable than TRON.

1313487,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B002ZG99QS,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[0, 2]","I remember not liking ""Tron"" when I saw it during the original release. The story seemed too simplistic and I didn't appreciate the ""cutting edge"" graphics. When I first heard Disney was making a sequel, some twenty plus years later, I was surprised. I didn't remember the original being very successful. Apparently, it became a 'cult favorite' and this prompted a big budget revisit to the Grid. As the buzz for the new film began, it became clear Disney was putting a lot into and behind this new film. Producing the film in 3-D is a no-brainer, but they have also been showing clips and building buzz at every comic book convention for what seems like years. Does all of this effort and trouble create a film worth watching?Yes. In fact, I really enjoyed ""Tron: Legacy"" and with the exception of two problematic areas, would give it a 4  star rating.The new film begins with a prologue. Sam Flynn clearly idolizes his dad, Kevin (Jeff Bridges), the visionary head of a software company, who fills his son's head with stories of ""The Grid"". But Kevin disappears, leaving Sam in the care of his grandparents. Flash forward twenty years and Sam (Garrett Hedlund, the soon to be released ""Country Strong"", the younger brother in ""Four Brothers"") is now living on the proceeds of the company he refuses to run. Given the fact he dislikes the direction the company is going, Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner), doesn't understand why he doesn't take control and start to build the company again. Alan tells Sam he received a page from Kevin, from the phone number of his old arcade, long since closed down. Sam becomes intrigued and visits the dusty arcade, finding a hidden room. Before you can say ""Reboot"", Sam ends up on the Grid and quickly gets thrust into a battle with other programs, all of whom are fighting to stay alive. He quickly attracts the attention of Clu (Bridges), a computer program who has taken over the development of the Grid; Sam has something Clu thinks will help him take control. And he wants it. He wants it bad. Quorra (Olivia Wilde, TV's ""House"", ""The Next Three Days"", the upcoming ""Cowboys Vs. Aliens"") sweeps in and saves Sam, taking him to meet his long lost father, Kevin, who now lives far off the Grid. Apparently Clu has plans to take over the Grid and eventually the outside world. Naturally, Kevin, Sam and Quorra have to stop him.Directed by Joseph Kosinski, a video game designer, and written by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz (Executive Producers and Writers on ""Lost""), ""Tron: Legacy"" is more engaging, better looking and more gratifying than the original. It is also unnecessarily complicated.Following the prologue, the filmmakers immediately thrust us into the action along with Sam. The young Flynn is a playboy and spends his time coming up with elaborate ""Mission: Impossible"" - like pranks to play on his dad's company. Immediately after he enters the Grid, he is forced into a battle with other programs and as soon as that begins to sink into our subconscious, he is thrust into a race and he begins racing around, trying to avoid those solid light streams which can destroy your speeder. These three sequences are pretty terrific and happen so quickly the pacing could almost be labeled relentless. This is a good thing in an action film; you never want to be bored. But once these segments play out, it almost seems as if the filmmakers have shot their wad. The next third of the film seems to be almost completely exposition and everything slows down considerably. This bit is also capped off by the three leads riding a slow moving transport vehicle, while talking about the past. It literally brings the film to a dead stop. Unfortunately, what they discuss doesn't really seem all that engaging or make a terrific amount of sense which helps put the brakes on the action. When this segment is over, the movement has to begin anew and it takes a while for everything to ramp up again. It just never seems to pick up the momentum.There is a lot of discussion about Clu taking over the Grid and his plans to take control of other things, other areas. There is also some discussion about the role both Sam and Quorra play in all of this. Unfortunately, it doesn't make a lot of sense. Because we don't (can't?) understand it, it seems to take even more time to explain it. At this point in the film, we don't need something to slow things down even more.The scenes in the beginning and end, pre-Grid, are all terrific looking and moody. Taking place entirely at night, Sam is a lone warrior, devising and executing elaborate pranks. This is his way of reacting to the way his father's company is now being run. Yet, these actions also point to his immaturity and need for connection with his long lost father. The darkness is a literal reflection of Sam's mood and a mirror to how the Grid looks. These scenes also appear to have the 3-D toned down.When Sam hits the Grid, everything pops into 3-D. This is a nice tough because it helps to make this world stand out and seem more interesting and unusual.The filmmakers have taken the familiar graphic elements of the first film and streamlined them, making them more modern and interesting. When I watched the first film, it felt like a film that would be cutting edge ten years earlier. ""Legacy"" feels like it embraces the current limits of the technology. The action scenes are really terrific to watch, especially the chase across the Grid. Much like the first film, the vehicles emit a light trail, which they need to avoid. But in this new film, these trails seem more fluid and natural, less rigid and angular.In ""Legacy"", Clu, Kevin Flynn's alter ego is also played by Jeff Bridges, but because he is a computer program, he doesn't age. Using CGI, the filmmakers have created a facsimile of Bridges during the mid-80s. It is an interesting technique but would be better served in small doses. As it is, Clu pops up a lot and has long conversations with other characters. The more this CGI representation of Bridges speaks, the more unrealistic he seems, his mouth just seems wrong. If he stayed in his universe, it would be more acceptable. But the filmmakers also use this same technique to recreate Kevin during the prologue. Honestly, the young Sam should have nightmares about his creepy father.James Frain (HBO's ""True Blood"") and Michael Sheen (""Twilight"", ""Frost/ Nixon"", ""The Queen"") pop up as two programs on the Grid. Frain is a little more interesting simply because he seems more subtle and human like. Sheen's Zuse is an over-the-top character who does some serious scenery chewing.Garrett Hedlund is good and believable as a young man who would be successful navigating the Grid, a foreign universe to most of us. When Sam and Kevin reunite, Hedlund is able to make us believe in what we are watching, a young man happy to be reunited with his long-lost dad. But he is also confused by all of the emotions running through his mind..Jeff Bridges returns to this big-screen reboot, playing both Kevin Flynn and Clu. I like the fact Bridges is able to keep some of his own mannerisms and dialect to portray this character. No one is going to forget it is Bridges, so allowing him to integrate himself into the role makes it a lot more fun.I enjoyed ""Tron: Legacy"" much more than I thought I would. It is also a terrific use of the new 3D technology, creating eye-popping visuals enhancing already enjoyable action scenes.",4,Fun and a Great Showcase of 3-D,1293667200,"12 30,

1313489,AMNFD1Y9HLLGZ,B002ZG99QS,"Tierra12 ""Tierra12""","[1, 2]","I was fortunate enough to be able to see Tron:  The Legacy opening weekend in IMAX 3D.  I also saw the movie in regular 3D.  Of the two formats I've seen the film in I can honestly say that seeing it in IMAX 3D is the way to go since it offers a more immersive experience.Tron:  The Legacy is the sequel to the moderately successful 1982 film Tron which was released 28 years ago.  Newcomers to the series (like myself since I never saw the original film) will find it easy to get into the world that the film creates since the movie centers around the original heroes' son a young man named Sam Flynn who is also a newcomer to the computer world of Tron.  As he learns about this new world, we the viewers get to learn about this digital world.The movie begins in 1989, where we (the viewers) are introduced to a seven year old Sam being told a bedtime story by his father Kevin Flynn.  After Kevin tells the wide-eyed and eager young Sam part of this magical story, he puts him to bed, and promises to finish the story later.  This doesn't happen since Kevin goes missing, leaving behind his young son.Fast-forward twenty years and Sam has grown up from an innocent boy to a directionless young man who wastes his potential and plays annual pranks on his dad's company ENCOM International.  Luckily for Sam his life of mediocrity comes to an abrupt end when he accidentally causes himself to be transported to the digital world.  It is here in this futurstic, black, barren, and very shiny world of Neon lights that Sam meets two versions of his father.  The first version of his father that Sam meets is CLU 2 (Codified Likeness Utility 2, being that Clu 1 was derezzed in the first Tron movie).  Clu 2 is a program that looks like his user Kevin Flynn did when he was younger.  Clu 2 also lacks any traces of humanity including any kind of care for Sam which makes their first meeting a sad one.  Sam also meets is real dad who has now grown old and wise from hard lessons he's learned from bad decisions and an unrealistic desire to create a perfect system.During Sam's meeting with his father, he learns that his father's creation Clu 2 revolted against him and that Clu 2 has not wavered from his father's dream of perfection.  He also learns that his father has been trapped in this digital world for 20 years.  Naturally, Sam wants to escape this digital world and take his father with him; however, leaving is a much harder thing to do than arriving.  If you want to know more about the escape plan and the adventure associated with it I'd recommend you watch the film.Visually speaking,  Tron:  The Legacy is certainly very pretty to look at, has a great musical score, fantastic fight sequences, and great costume designs (they're modern, hip, sleek, and sexy).  These visuals are especially impressive with the graphics they used to de-age Jeff Bridges and transforming him into a younger version of himself). It's an effect that has to be seen to be believed especially when young Jeff comes face-to-face with old Jeff.Rating: A-",5,Welcome to the Grid,1295395200,"01 19, 2011",2011,3043,"['was', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'opening', 'weekend', 'IMAX', '3D', 'also', 'saw', 'movie', 'regular', '3D', 'two', 'formats', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'seeing', 'IMAX', '3D', 'way', 'go', 'more', 'immersive', 'experience.Tron', 'Legacy', 'sequel', 'moderately', 'successful', '1982', 'film', 'Tron', 'was', 'released', '28', 'years', 'ago', 'Newcomers', 'series', 'never', 'saw', 'original', 'film', 'will', 'find', 'easy', 'get', 'world', 'film', 'movie', 'centers', 'original', 'heroes', 'son', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Sam', 'Flynn', 'who', 'also', 'newcomer', 'computer', 'world', 'Tron', 'new', 'world', 'viewers', 'get', 'learn', 'digital', 'world.The', 'movie', '1989', 'where', 'viewers', 'are', 'introduced', 'seven', 'year', 'old', 'Sam', 'being', 'told', 'bedtime', 'story', 'father', 'Kevin', 'Flynn', 'Kevin', 'wide-eyed', 'eager', 'young', 'Sam', 'part', 'magical', 'story', 'bed', 'promises', 'finish', 'story', 'later', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Kevin', 'missing', 'leaving', 'young', 'son.Fast-forward', 'twenty', 'years', 'Sam', 'grown', 'up', 'innocent', 'boy', 'directionless', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'potential', 'plays', 'annual', 'pranks', 'dad', 'company', 'ENCOM', 'International', 'Luckily', 'Sam', 'life', 'mediocrity', 'abrupt', 'end', 'when', 'accidentally', 'be', 'transported', 'digital', 'world', 'here', 'futurstic', 'black', 'barren', 'very', 'shiny', 'world', 'Neon', 'lights', 'Sam', 'two', 'versions', 'father', 'first', 'version', 'father', 'Sam', 'meets', 'CLU', '2', 'Codified', 'Likeness', 'Utility', '2', 'being', 'Clu', '1', 'was', 'derezzed', 'first', 'Tron', 'movie', '2', 'program', 'user', 'Kevin', 'Flynn', 'did', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'Clu', '2', 'also', 'traces', 'humanity', 'including', 'kind', 'care', 'Sam', 'first', 'meeting', 'sad', 'one', 'Sam', 'also', 'real', 'dad', 'who', 'now', 'grown', 'old', 'wise', 'hard', 'lessons', 'learned', 'bad', 'decisions', 'unrealistic', 'desire', 'create', 'perfect', 'system.During', 'Sam', 'meeting', 'father', 'father', 'creation', 'Clu', '2', 'revolted', 'Clu', '2', 'not', 'wavered', 'father', 'dream', 'perfection', 'also', 'father', 'been', 'trapped', 'digital', 'world', '20', 'years', 'Naturally', 'Sam', 'escape', 'digital', 'world', 'take', 'father', 'however', 'leaving', 'much', 'harder', 'thing', 'do', 'arriving', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'escape', 'plan', 'adventure', 'associated', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'watch', 'film.Visually', 'speaking', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'certainly', 'very', 'pretty', 'look', 'great', 'musical', 'score', 'fantastic', 'fight', 'sequences', 'great', 'costume', 'designs', ""'re"", 'modern', 'hip', 'sleek', 'sexy', 'visuals', 'are', 'especially', 'impressive', 'graphics', 'used', 'de-age', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'transforming', 'younger', 'version', 'effect', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'especially', 'when', 'young', 'Jeff', 'face-to-face', 'old', 'Jeff.Rating', 'A-']",N/A

I'm sure if the technology was available back in the early 80s, in terms of special effects, 'Tron: Legacy' is the movie that would have been made. It's not only an homage to the original, but a dazzling dream scape in its own right and the creative effects team should be praised highly for their efforts.That said, without a good story, all the special effects in the world cannot make a decent movie, great. It starts off rather nicely though with the focus on the effect of Kevin Flynn's disappearance on his young son, Sam. The film's scenarists were wise to create an internal arc in which Sam's main motivation is to reunite with his long lost father. We soon discover that Kevin's disappearance in the 80s has affected Sam in a most negative way as an adult. Despite being the controlling shareholder of his Dad's multinational company, ENCOM, Sam spends his time playing a practical jokes on the Board of Directors, such as breaking into company headquarters, hacking into the computer system and briefly posting a new software application on the internet.One notices that the ENCOM break-in scene is much too long as well as the meeting with Alan Bradley, his father's old friend, who informs Sam of a mysterious page (Alan still uses a pager) emanating from the old Flynn arcade which had been shut down for twenty years, Sam discovers his father's laboratory through a hidden passageway inside the arcade and after a few keyboard strokes, Sam is inadvertently transported inside the virtual world of the computer. What's interesting is that this computer world has no interface with today's cyberspace and reflects the computer landscape of the early 1980s.Once Sam is dropped into the virtual world, there are two sensational sequences with Sam battling the minions of CLU, his father's digital clone, who seeks to create a perfect world by subjugating everyone to his will. Sam's first battle involves gladiator-like combat where the combatants throw computer discs at one another and must jump from level to level on a chess-like grid. All the while, a huge crowd is enjoying the carnage. Sam is then brought before CLU, who has the face of the young Jeff Bridges, who appeared in the original Tron. CLU challenges Sam to a life cycle race (on digital motorcycles) and Sam is saved by Quorra, Kevin's assistant, who turns out to be last remaining ISO (Isomorphic Algorithm). The ISOs are sentient beings who somehow are found to contain DNA inside the virtual world. Quorra is played by the lovely Olivia Wilde (who reminds me of a young Kirstie Alley, playing 'Saavik' in the first Star Trek movie).The story slows down a bit when Sam finally reunites over the dinner table with his father who's morphed into a Zen-like Master. There's some dull chatter about each of them having gone to Cal Tech and then a better (and brief flashback) as Kevin explains how CLU wiped out the ISOs. Kevin also explains to Sam about the portal that was opened up when Sam arrived in the virtual world, how that's the only way out and it's going to close real soon. Kevin has this dumb idea that CLU can be defeated by opposing forces within the virtual world but Sam knows better--the only way to defeat CLU is delete the program from the outside and the only way to do that, is get to the portal and get out before it closes.You would think that all-knowing Quorra would then give Sam some good advice on how to get to the portal in the nick of time, but she recommends he look up Zuse, a sleazy David Bowie-like character who ends up betraying Sam, snatching his father's 'disc' (which CLU needs as it works as the master key to the Grid). Of course Dad shows up and saves Sam from CLU's clutches. There's a weak scene after that where Zuse bargains with CLU with no backup, gives up the disc, and is then easily murdered by CLU, when he blows up Zuse's nightclub. Meanwhile, Quorra has one of her arms blown off by CLU's henchmen and fortunately Kevin reprograms her so she can regenerate all her dead tissue.The final climax is a good one where virtual jet fighters are used in a race to the portal. Kevin uses his Zen-like powers to reprogram the original 'Tron' right before he kills Quorra and also uses Zen-like powers to prevent CLU from stopping Sam and Quorra successfully getting through the portal.I'm not sure how Quorra is able to survive outside the virtual world but as stated before, the actor who plays her, Olivia Wilde, is worth the price of admission.While Jeff Bridges does well playing his alter egos, the characters themselves aren't very complex. If you're looking for a story that will massage your brain, you won't find it here. But the special effects are dazzling and are enough to keep you entertained, despite the simplicity of the good versus evil storyline.",3,"Dazzling special effects save predictable, battling alter

Revolving around Flynns son Sam this movie pays a true tribute to its 1982 predecessor, by bringing back the same actors that made it big in the first place. Also, by attempting to push the bar in computer technology. The most amazing thing I saw in this movie was the ability to stick Jeff Bridges' head on a younger body to re-create a younger version of himself. Also all of the action sequences are amazing and the whole movie itself shows you just how much more advance the world of computers has become since the first movie. Even by paying tribute to some of the games that were played in the first film. It showed us that even those simple games got even more complex how things weren't just cubes and strait lines anymore. The computer world has evolved so much and so fast it has practically caught up with the real world itself. That makes the stakes much higher for our heros. What I also took from Tron Legacy is that we will never be perfect, we are always going to be discovering new things at every turn and just because they may not always keep us in our comfort zone we need to try and move forward and see what the future will bring to us.Acting wise the movie isn't at its strongest and like the first one it does have a few dead spots. Still Jeff Bridges is awesome and I was blown away that they managed to bring Bruce Boxlightner back into the spotlight and it seems like he now has some new projects in the works for his career.Tron Legacy, while it is not perfect, I loved it and would recommend it to anyone who wants to see something new.(but you gotta see the first one first) The best part about this movie was the soundtrack, Daft Punk drives this movie from beginning to end and even if you end up hating this movie you will still love the soundtrack. Now, there is an animated series premering this fall and there are talks of a third installment I am very curious to see where we will go next in the world of Tron.",5,Tron gets with the times,1304121600,"04 30, 2011",2011,2138,"['was', 'always', 'hearing', 'rumors', 'Tron', 'sequel', 'was', 'works', 'finally', 'got', 'Tron', 'Legacy.After', 'waiting', 'nearly', '30', 'years', 'Tron', 'movie', 'going', 'public', 'never', 'before', 'Revolving', 'Flynns', 'son', 'Sam', 'movie', 'true', 'tribute', '1982', 'predecessor', 'bringing', 'back', 'same', 'actors', 'made', 'big', 'first', 'place', 'Also', 'attempting', 'push', 'bar', 'computer', 'technology', 'most', 'amazing', 'thing', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'ability', 'stick', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'head', 'younger', 'body', 're-create', 'younger', 'version', 'Also', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'amazing', 'whole', 'movie', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'world', 'computers', 'become', 'first', 'movie', 'Even', 'paying', 'tribute', 'games', 'were', 'played', 'first', 'film', 'showed', 'even', 'simple', 'games', 'got', 'even', 'more', 'complex', 'how', 'things', 'were', ""n't"", 'just', 'cubes', 'strait', 'lines', 'anymore', 'computer', 'world', 'evolved', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'fast', 'practically', 'caught', 'up', 'real', 'world', 'stakes', 'much', 'higher', 'heros', 'What', 'also', 'took', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'perfect', 'are', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'discovering', 'new', 'things', 'turn', 'just', 'may', 'not', 'always', 'keep', 'comfort', 'zone', 'need', 'try', 'move', 'forward', 'see', 'what', 'future', 'will', 'bring', 'us.Acting', 'wise', 'movie', ""n't"", 'strongest', 'first', 'one', 'have', 'few', 'dead', 'spots', 'Still', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'awesome', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'managed', 'bring', 'Bruce', 'Boxlightner', 'back', 'spotlight', 'now', 'new', 'projects', 'works', 'career.Tron', 'Legacy', 'not', 'perfect', 'loved', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'see', 'something', 'new', 'got', 'ta', 'see', 'first', 'one', 'first', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'soundtrack', 'Daft', 'Punk', 'movie', 'beginning', 'end', 'even', 'end', 'up', 'hating', 'movie', 'will', 'still', 'love', 'soundtrack', 'Now', 'animated', 'series', 'premering', 'fall', 'are', 'talks', 'third', 'installment', 'am', 'very', 'curious', 'see', 'where', 'will', 'go', 'next', 'world', 'Tron']",N/A

1313502,A3QMJMTLJC34QC,B002ZG99QS,"Vincent E. Martin ""Darkbard""","[7, 28]","Bottom-Line:  ""Tron Legacy"" was an alright movie, but I would not see it again nor highly recommend it.Trends in movie making come and go, and I had hoped that 3-D had seen its time, but its back, but that's in line with the ""everything old is new again"" theme currently sweeping through Hollywood studios.  And that brings us to ""Tron Legacy"" in 3-D.  Having experienced movie is 3-D in the `70's I would just assume skip it now, and as it happens I did not intend to see Tron Legacy 3-D, but it's the only version the local theater had, so...Story-LineDirected by new-comer Joseph Kosinski, Tron Legacy 3-D picks up where the original Tron (1982) supposedly left off.  The movie opens on Kevin Flynn portrayed by Jeff Bridges (True Grit, Crazy Heart, Iron Man) talking to his young son Sam Flynn about Tron.  Fade to black and Daddy Flynn disappears, light come up and Sam Flynn portrayed by a very bland Garrett Hedlund (Four Brothers, Troy, Eragon) is all grown up and has shunned the gaming company his father started choosing to live the life of techno-recluse on a fast motorcycle.However, after Sam engages in a bit of corporate sabotage, he is sought out by his father's right hand man Alan Brady, portrayed by Bruce Boxleitner (Tron, Babylon 5, Scarecrow & Mrs. King) who gives him to keys to his father's old video game store.  Same reluctantly goes of course, and discovers his father's old workshop with equipment still humming away.  A few keyboard strokes later and Sam is in the Tron universe and quickly identified as a ""player.""The games begins naturally and Sam bests all comers except Tron and is rescued by Quorra portrayed by and equally bland Olivia Wilde (The O.C., Alpha Dog, House M.D.), who just happens to work and live with Sam's father, who we discover is also stuck in the game and doing battle with his (evil) clone.My ThoughtsJeff Bridges is in the middle of a renaissance of sorts; an aging American actor popping up in all sorts of high budget, high profile movies and turning in critically acclaimed performances.  ""Tron Legacy 3-D"" will not win him any awards, or acclaim.  But, then I doubt the makers of this B-movie thought ""Tron Legacy"" was anything than what it is, a fair good live-action movie, which is thin on story and acting.I do not like 3-D.  Cool at first, the effect quickly lost its luster as ""Tron Legacy"" progressed.  Watching a film in 3-D is like watching it through muddy water, the movie loses its sharpness and vibrancy; i.e. the colors are muted and take the 3-D glasses off and the movie becomes out of focus!  I do not like 3-D and I will avoid all movies in 3-D in the future.  To be fair, some of the effects in 3-D were cool, but there were not enough of them to sit through this rather dark movie fiddling with over-sized plastic glasses.  I would end by saying that 3-D is for children, not adults, who should take the movie-going experience seriously.My dislike of 3-D aside, ""Tron Legacy"" was an alright movie, but I would not see it again nor highly recommend it.  The action sequences were well done, but there were slow spots where frankly I had to fight to stay awake.  And this says a lot about the lack of a compelling story-line outside the action.  There is nothing new in ""Tron Legacy""; we have been down this rabbit-hole before; it is a tried and true formula without much more to say.I wanted to like ""Tron Legacy"", but really after one gets past the cool form fitting neon-glow costumes, whizzing Frisbee/disc weapons, seriously cool vehicles and cyberspace milieu, there isn't much to get excited about.  Though I was only a passing fan of the original movie I was excited about the reboot, attracted by the promise of gee-wiz CGI special effects.  On that score the movie delivered, but in the end the story made little sense, and unless we are in the middle of non-stop action--we're not here--the store should be compelling enough to keep me awake!",2,"Outside of Action, There is Little to See Here",1293580800,"12 29, 2010",2010,3934,"['Bottom-Line', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'was', 'alright', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'see', 'again', 'highly', 'recommend', 'it.Trends', 'movie', 'making', 'come', 'go', 'had', 'hoped', '3-D', 'had', 'seen', 'time', 'back', 'line', 'everything', 'old', 'new', 'again', 'theme', 'currently', 'sweeping', 'Hollywood', 'studios', 'Tron', 'Legacy', '3-D.', 'Having', 'experienced', 'movie', '3-D', '70', 'would', 'just', 'assume', 'skip', 'now', 'did', 'not', 'intend', 'see', 'Tron', 'Legacy', '3-D', 'only', 'version', 'local', 'theater', 'had', 'so', 'Story-LineDirected', 'new-comer', 'Joseph', 'Kosinski', 'Tron', 'Legacy', '3-D', 'picks', 'where', 'original', 'Tron', '1982', 'supposedly', 'left', 'off', 'movie', 'Kevin', 'Flynn', 'portrayed', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'True', 'Grit', 'Crazy', 'Heart', 'Iron', 'Man', 'talking', 'young', 'son', 'Sam', 'Flynn', 'Tron', 'Fade', 'black', 'Daddy', 'Flynn', 'light', 'come', 'up', 'Sam', 'Flynn', 'portrayed', 'very', 'bland', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'Four', 'Brothers', 'Troy', 'Eragon', 'grown', 'up', 'shunned', 'gaming', 'company', 'father', 'started', 'choosing', 'live', 'life', 'techno-recluse', 'fast', 'motorcycle.However', 'Sam', 'bit', 'corporate', 'sabotage', 'sought', 'out', 'father', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'Alan', 'Brady', 'portrayed', 'Bruce', 'Boxleitner', 'Tron', 'Babylon', '5', 'Scarecrow', 'Mrs.', 'King', 'who', 'keys', 'father', 'old', 'video', 'game', 'store', 'Same', 'reluctantly', 'course', 'father', 'old', 'workshop', 'equipment', 'still', 'humming', 'away', 'few', 'keyboard', 'strokes', 'later', 'Sam', 'Tron', 'universe', 'quickly', 'identified', 'player', 'games', 'naturally', 'Sam', 'comers', 'Tron', 'rescued', 'Quorra', 'portrayed', 'equally', 'bland', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'O.C.', 'Alpha', 'Dog', 'House', 'M.D', 'who', 'just', 'work', 'live', 'Sam', 'father', 'who', 'discover', 'also', 'stuck', 'game', 'doing', 'battle', 'evil', 'clone.My', 'ThoughtsJeff', 'Bridges', 'middle', 'renaissance', 'sorts', 'aging', 'American', 'actor', 'popping', 'up', 'sorts', 'high', 'budget', 'high', 'profile', 'movies', 'turning', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'performances', 'Tron', 'Legacy', '3-D', 'will', 'not', 'win', 'awards', 'acclaim', 'then', 'doubt', 'makers', 'B-movie', 'thought', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'was', 'anything', 'what', 'fair', 'good', 'live-action', 'movie', 'thin', 'story', 'acting.I', 'do', 'not', '3-D', 'Cool', 'first', 'effect', 'quickly', 'lost', 'luster', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'progressed', 'Watching', 'film', '3-D', 'watching', 'muddy', 'water', 'movie', 'sharpness', 'vibrancy', 'i.e', 'colors', 'are', 'muted', 'take', '3-D', 'glasses', 'movie', 'focus', 'do', 'not', '3-D', 'will', 'avoid', 'movies', '3-D', 'future', 'be', 'fair', 'effects', '3-D', 'were', 'cool', 'were', 'not', 'enough', 'sit', 'rather', 'dark', 'movie', 'fiddling', 'over-sized', 'plastic', 'glasses', 'would', 'end', 'saying', '3-D', 'children', 'not', 'adults', 'who', 'should', 'take', 'movie-going', 'experience', 'seriously.My', 'dislike', '3-D', 'aside', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'was', 'alright', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'see', 'again', 'highly', 'recommend', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'were', 'slow', 'spots', 'where', 'frankly', 'had', 'fight', 'stay', 'awake', 'lot', 'lack', 'compelling', 'story-line', 'action', 'nothing', 'new', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'have', 'been', 'down', 'rabbit-hole', 'tried', 'true', 'formula', 'much', 'more', 'say.I', 'wanted', 'like', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'really', 'one', 'cool', 'form', 'fitting', 'neon-glow', 'costumes', 'whizzing', 'Frisbee/disc', 'weapons', 'seriously', 'cool', 'vehicles', 'cyberspace', 'milieu', ""n't"", 'much', 'get', 'excited', 'was', 'only', 'passing', 'fan', 'original', 'movie', 'was', 'excited', 'reboot', 'attracted', 'promise', 'gee-wiz', 'CGI', 'special', 'effects', 'score', 'movie', 'delivered', 'end', 'story', 'made', 'little', 'sense', 'are', 'middle', 'non-stop', 'action', ""'re"", 'not', 'here', 'store', 'should', 'be', 'compelling', 'enough', 'keep', 'awake']",N/A

1313505,A4OSXRZR2BMX8,B002ZG99QS,"William Merrill ""eclecticist""","[4, 11]","I saw TRON Legacy in IMAX 3D, and I was impressed at times but it never really came close to meeting my expectations.  To begin with, the first half-hour or so (set in ""the real world"") is relatively humdrum and not unique: a flashback scene to the hero's youth (in which the younger/ CGI Jeff Bridges has problems with realistic lip movements while talking), a bit of industrial espionage the likes of which we've seen many times before, and a setup scene for Sam (the son) to enter The Grid.  Once he's into the Grid, the part of the movie we've come to see actually begins.As Sam searches for his dad and battles the Big Bad Guy (CLU), we get the light-cycle race, one of two pretty cool scenes in the movie.  (The other is the ""dogfight"" scene, late in the film.)  This is where the 3D could have been used more effectively and to a greater extent, but it wasn't.  You know how you're amazed in 3D movies with stuff that pops out in front of you? Feeling like you could almost reach out and touch them?  Well, that doesn't happen very often in TRON Legacy.  Perhaps the moviemakers were aiming for a more integrated use of 3D, so it appears natural and is hardly noticed.  If so, that seems to go against the entire concept of 3D movies.  The limited use of 3D was the biggest problem for me.But there were so many more flaws, including (1) Even though the light-cycle and dogfight scenes were cool, the moments when one rider/ pilot defeated one of their enemies happened too quickly to really see how or why the enemy was defeated.  One second the two were coming together, the next, one of them was dissolving into pieces (bytes?), with little clue on what actually caused the destruction. That confusion could've been solved by a slo-mo cutaway or other ways. (2) The sound was often too LOUD (no surprise), especially the music in some scenes.  A related sound problem is that dialog was often hard to make out, either due to an echo chamber effect or an excess of background noise.  (3) The story was poorly constructed at times, such as how Zeus was initially supposed to be a good guy, but he never really seemed for a moment like he was actually going to help the heroes (and many other similar things).There are various great looking visuals in The Grid portion of the flick, such as when the ""cargo ship"" flies across the beam toward the Portal.  So TRON Legacy wasn't a completely worthless movie.  The sad thing is that, as usual, so many viewers will quickly and easily overlook the many problems just because a few scenes are cool.  That's just the way things are with filmgoing these days.",3,"Some dazzling scenes, but also problems",1292544000,"12 17, 2010",2010,2609,"['saw', 'TRON', 'Legacy', 'IMAX', '3D', 'was', 'impressed', 'times', 'never', 'really', 'came', 'close', 'meeting', 'expectations', 'begin', 'first', 'half-hour', 'so', 'set', 'real', 'world', 'relatively', 'humdrum', 'not', 'unique', 'flashback', 'scene', 'hero', 'youth', 'younger/', 'CGI', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'problems', 'realistic', 'lip', 'movements', 'talking', 'bit', 'industrial', 'espionage', 'likes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'setup', 'scene', 'Sam', 'son', 'enter', 'Grid', 'Grid', 'part', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'come', 'see', 'actually', 'begins.As', 'Sam', 'searches', 'dad', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'CLU', 'get', 'light-cycle', 'race', 'one', 'two', 'pretty', 'cool', 'scenes', 'movie', 'other', 'dogfight', 'scene', 'late', 'film', 'where', '3D', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'more', 'effectively', 'greater', 'extent', 'was', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', ""'re"", 'amazed', '3D', 'movies', 'stuff', 'out', 'front', 'Feeling', 'could', 'almost', 'reach', 'out', 'touch', 'Well', ""n't"", 'happen', 'very', 'often', 'TRON', 'Legacy', 'Perhaps', 'moviemakers', 'were', 'aiming', 'more', 'integrated', 'use', '3D', 'natural', 'hardly', 'noticed', 'so', 'go', 'entire', 'concept', '3D', 'movies', 'limited', 'use', '3D', 'was', 'biggest', 'problem', 'me.But', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'flaws', 'including', '1', 'Even', 'light-cycle', 'dogfight', 'scenes', 'were', 'cool', 'moments', 'when', 'one', 'rider/', 'pilot', 'defeated', 'one', 'enemies', 'happened', 'too', 'quickly', 'really', 'see', 'how', 'why', 'enemy', 'was', 'defeated', 'One', 'second', 'two', 'were', 'coming', 'together', 'next', 'one', 'was', 'dissolving', 'pieces', 'bytes', 'little', 'clue', 'what', 'actually', 'caused', 'destruction', 'confusion', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'solved', 'slo-mo', 'cutaway', 'other', 'ways', '2', 'sound', 'was', 'often', 'too', 'LOUD', 'surprise', 'especially', 'music', 'scenes', 'related', 'sound', 'problem', 'dialog', 'was', 'often', 'hard', 'make', 'out', 'either', 'due', 'echo', 'chamber', 'effect', 'excess', 'background', 'noise', '3', 'story', 'was', 'poorly', 'constructed', 'times', 'such', 'how', 'Zeus', 'was', 'initially', 'supposed', 'be', 'good', 'guy', 'never', 'really', 'seemed', 'moment', 'was', 'actually', 'going', 'help', 'heroes', 'many', 'other', 'similar', 'things', 'are', 'various', 'great', 'looking', 'visuals', 'Grid', 'portion', 'flick', 'such', 'when', 'cargo', 'ship', 'flies', 'beam', 'Portal', 'So', 'TRON', 'Legacy', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'worthless', 'movie', 'sad', 'thing', 'that', 'usual', 'so', 'many', 'viewers', 'will', 'quickly', 'easily', 'overlook', 'many', 'problems', 'just', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'cool', 'just', 'way', 'things', 'are', 'filmgoing', 'days']",N/A

That leaves plenty of expressive range, however, from Clu's beetle-helmed henchmen, to the sterile sexiness of the white-clad ""Sirens,"" to Zuse's manic manner. The arcade-game illumination got plenty of help from the exceptional sound track, too. Imagine a day in the life of a pinball, rendered into music by the James Bond composers. (Even the opening credits featured a unique take on the iconic Disney fairy-castle, something that primed me for a visual treat.)That brings me to other visual elements, too, and not just the remarkable synthespian built electronically from the younger Bridges's face.
