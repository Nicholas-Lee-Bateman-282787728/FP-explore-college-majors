Working at a video store these days, my manager (who was going to send it back due to the content) decided to watch it and told me that it was funny...she must have a real bad sense of humor or something....not ""hilarious"" in the least.  The story is cute, but both actors (although good in other films) failed to bring this one home. As mentioned in the last review, the humor is sub-par, and the overall picture is BORING!!!

900771,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00092ZMXY,Grady Harp,"[7, 7]","STRANGE BEDFELLOWS is one of those films that plays like a TV sitcom without the canned laughter - especially now that gay themed shows have made it big on television.  This film's main charm is its Aussie flavor and that forgives a lot of the shortcomings of a fluffy idea of a script.Essentially, two men (Paul Hogan and Michael Caton) decide to avoid back taxes and take advantage of a new law that allows same sex partners to gain the rights of married couples by passing as a gay married couple.  How they go about convincing each other that they can pass as gay in order to convince the authorities and then how they can learn to act gay and live a gay life to back up their story is the action of the movie.  Many stereotypes are included but somehow the Aussies know how to pull this off with minimal offense.The overall theme, after the story is all said and done, is one of tolerance and compassion for people who are in different societal climes.  Hogan and Caton pull this off well, showing how really everyone they meet in their charade is just a 'regular guy' - and for that reason the film becomes more tolerable than the usual farces that deal with 'passing'.  Not a great movie, but one with a wink!

900772,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B00092ZMXY,MadMacs,"[1, 1]","It's unfortunate that Paul Hogan will always be that character. A perfect example of an accomplishment that was both a blessing and a curse; because the man's talent is greater than the role that first brought him fame. And he's achieved so more than many one-role actors, both as a screenwriter and producer.Like 'Almost An Angel', this is one of those performances that showcases the actor in a different light than his previous efforts.In this film he plays Vince, divorcee and small town theater proprietor who is about to be buggered two ways to Sunday by the tax department. His detestable ex-wife has racked up an astounding tax bill while running multiple failed businesses. Unfortunately, to facilitate the separation from the witch, she and her boyfriend manipulated him into blindly signing paperwork - and it's his name on the various corporate papers. Understandably, the tax assayer holds that person responsible for the liability. Despite attempts to explain, the government wants its money. Even if they have to bankrupt him to get it.Desperate times call for desperate measures. And Vince has an idea.His best bud is Ralph. Nice guy who runs the local auto shop in their tiny rural village of Yankandandah. (Believe it or not, it's an actual township deep in Australia's Victoria territory) Now, the pair have been best buds for as long as either can remember. And it's that friendship that Vince is calling upon in his hour of need.He wants them to go gay.Well, more specifically, Vince wants to file as a same sex couple for the multiple tax breaks such couples can claim. It's all set up for an easy score. Do the paperwork, get the credit, and presto - Vince's problems with the tax man are gone. Easy peasy - lemon squeezy.Except... there are a few 'glitches'.First and foremost: The tax office is sending an officer to investigate. Having been played by that particular scam, they're now looking at all claims with a very jaundiced eye. And the man they send isn't a bureaucratic paper-pusher. Played by the imitable Pete Postleswaite, who very sadly recently passed away at the young age of 64, his character is by-the-book as they come. He's not messing about. If he discovers fraud, he's going to personally see the two get hammered to the fullest extent allowed by law. It's jail time if the pair of knuckleheads fail to convince him.Second: Because of said inspection and its inspector - they have to ""learn"" to be gay - convincingly. Even if that means blackmailing their local hairdresser for lessons and traveling to the big city to validate those lessons in the happiest community in Oz. The country, not the prison.Third: By pure accident the entire town learns of the their recently out-ted ""couple"". For a straight-laced community, this the equivalent of a dropping a fuel-air bomb into the center of town. Completely fractured, the residents split along traditional lines. Unsure of what to do or think, the furious debate hilariously takes place completely unbeknownst to the guys. They only know that 'something is up' when they catch people quickly diverting their gazes and immediately shutting down any conversation when either of them shows up.On their journey to avoid chains and lockup, Vince and Ralph make an unexpected discovery: That love is love regardless of whom you devote that very precious commodity. And that the love one feels for a bud is just as real and valid as one feels for an intimate partner.This production is not only hilariously funny, but fascinating. Challenging the &uuml;ber-masculine view that many Aussies display when confronted with homosexuality. Considered weak and poofy, many are disparaged for having a differing sexual orientation. To be fair, some of that is fair criticism. It's not enough that some from that team tend to be ridiculously flamboyant, but they can often be arrogant and viciously opinionated - generally not a combination of personality traits that would be enjoyable in *any* person, regardless of sexual orientation. If those on their team were all like Anderson Cooper, I doubt such blatant aggression and antipathy would be produced. Just sayin'.Extremely enjoyable and proof positive that Hogan was always more than just a one-hit wonder. It's unfortunate that audiences couldn't or wouldn't accept that fact.",4,Subtle Tolerance Lesson Enveloped In A Quiet Comedy,1348876800,"09 29, 2012",2012,4313,"['unfortunate', 'Paul', 'Hogan', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'character', 'perfect', 'example', 'accomplishment', 'was', 'blessing', 'curse', 'man', 'talent', 'greater', 'role', 'first', 'brought', 'fame', 'achieved', 'so', 'more', 'many', 'one-role', 'actors', 'screenwriter', 'producer.Like', ""'Almost"", 'Angel', 'one', 'performances', 'actor', 'different', 'light', 'previous', 'efforts.In', 'film', 'Vince', 'divorcee', 'small', 'town', 'theater', 'proprietor', 'who', 'be', 'buggered', 'two', 'ways', 'Sunday', 'tax', 'department', 'detestable', 'ex-wife', 'racked', 'up', 'astounding', 'tax', 'bill', 'running', 'multiple', 'failed', 'businesses', 'Unfortunately', 'facilitate', 'separation', 'witch', 'boyfriend', 'manipulated', 'blindly', 'signing', 'paperwork', 'name', 'various', 'corporate', 'papers', 'Understandably', 'tax', 'assayer', 'person', 'responsible', 'liability', 'attempts', 'explain', 'government', 'money', 'Even', 'have', 'bankrupt', 'get', 'it.Desperate', 'times', 'call', 'desperate', 'measures', 'Vince', 'idea.His', 'best', 'bud', 'Ralph', 'Nice', 'guy', 'who', 'local', 'auto', 'shop', 'tiny', 'rural', 'village', 'Yankandandah', 'Believe', 'not', 'actual', 'township', 'deep', 'Australia', 'Victoria', 'territory', 'Now', 'pair', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'buds', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'remember', 'friendship', 'Vince', 'calling', 'hour', 'need.He', 'go', 'gay.Well', 'more', 'specifically', 'Vince', 'file', 'same', 'sex', 'couple', 'multiple', 'tax', 'breaks', 'such', 'couples', 'can', 'claim', 'set', 'up', 'easy', 'score', 'Do', 'paperwork', 'get', 'credit', 'presto', 'Vince', 'problems', 'tax', 'man', 'are', 'gone', 'Easy', 'peasy', 'lemon', 'squeezy.Except', 'are', 'few', ""'glitches'.First"", 'foremost', 'tax', 'office', 'sending', 'officer', 'investigate', 'Having', 'been', 'played', 'particular', 'scam', ""'re"", 'now', 'looking', 'claims', 'very', 'jaundiced', 'eye', 'man', 'send', ""n't"", 'bureaucratic', 'paper-pusher', 'Played', 'imitable', 'Pete', 'Postleswaite', 'who', 'very', 'sadly', 'recently', 'passed', 'away', 'young', 'age', '64', 'character', 'by-the-book', 'come', 'not', 'messing', 'about', 'fraud', 'going', 'personally', 'see', 'two', 'get', 'hammered', 'fullest', 'extent', 'allowed', 'law', 'jail', 'time', 'pair', 'knuckleheads', 'fail', 'convince', 'him.Second', 'said', 'inspection', 'inspector', 'have', 'learn', 'be', 'gay', 'convincingly', 'Even', 'blackmailing', 'local', 'hairdresser', 'lessons', 'traveling', 'big', 'city', 'validate', 'lessons', 'happiest', 'community', 'Oz', 'country', 'not', 'prison.Third', 'pure', 'accident', 'entire', 'town', 'learns', 'recently', 'out-ted', 'couple', 'straight-laced', 'community', 'equivalent', 'dropping', 'fuel-air', 'bomb', 'center', 'town', 'Completely', 'fractured', 'residents', 'split', 'traditional', 'lines', 'Unsure', 'what', 'do', 'think', 'furious', 'debate', 'hilariously', 'place', 'completely', 'unbeknownst', 'guys', 'only', 'know', ""'something"", 'up', 'when', 'catch', 'people', 'quickly', 'diverting', 'gazes', 'immediately', 'shutting', 'down', 'conversation', 'when', 'up.On', 'journey', 'avoid', 'chains', 'lockup', 'Vince', 'Ralph', 'make', 'unexpected', 'discovery', 'love', 'love', 'regardless', 'whom', 'devote', 'very', 'precious', 'commodity', 'love', 'one', 'feels', 'bud', 'just', 'real', 'valid', 'one', 'feels', 'intimate', 'partner.This', 'production', 'not', 'only', 'hilariously', 'funny', 'fascinating', 'Challenging', 'uuml', 'ber-masculine', 'view', 'many', 'Aussies', 'display', 'when', 'confronted', 'homosexuality', 'Considered', 'weak', 'poofy', 'many', 'are', 'disparaged', 'having', 'differing', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'be', 'fair', 'fair', 'criticism', 'not', 'enough', 'team', 'tend', 'be', 'ridiculously', 'flamboyant', 'can', 'often', 'be', 'arrogant', 'viciously', 'opinionated', 'generally', 'not', 'combination', 'personality', 'traits', 'would', 'be', 'enjoyable', '*any*', 'person', 'regardless', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'team', 'were', 'Anderson', 'Cooper', 'doubt', 'such', 'blatant', 'aggression', 'antipathy', 'would', 'be', 'produced', 'Just', ""sayin'.Extremely"", 'enjoyable', 'proof', 'positive', 'Hogan', 'was', 'always', 'more', 'just', 'one-hit', 'wonder', 'unfortunate', 'audiences', 'could', ""n't"", 'would', ""n't"", 'accept', 'fact']",Strange Bedfellows
900773,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B00092ZMXY,Michael Butts,"[3, 4]","STRANGE BEDFELLOWS is a somewhat lighthearted examination of relationships, perceptions and masculine bonding.  In an attempt to avoid bankruptcy, Paul Hogan (Crocodile Dundee himself) convinces his lifelong friend (a superb Michael Caton) to pose as his life partner to capitalize on a new tax law supporting gay couples.  Of course, there is the expected coaching from the local male hairdresser (who is really straight but fakes his homosexuality because it's expected); a trip to a gay bar in Syndey where they bond with a collection of ""fops""; and the showdown at the big local dance.  The movie is to be admired for its refusal to fall into the general stereotypical emotions about homsexuals, and for its sensitivity to relationships in general.  It's not riotously funny, but is mildly amusing.  Hogan seems a little too removed from the film to be effective, but Caton and the other supporting players (including Pete Postelthwaite as the investigator) are charming.",3,A GAY CROCODILE DUNDEE?,1127952000,"09 29, 2005",2005,975,"['STRANGE', 'BEDFELLOWS', 'somewhat', 'lighthearted', 'examination', 'relationships', 'perceptions', 'masculine', 'bonding', 'attempt', 'avoid', 'bankruptcy', 'Paul', 'Hogan', 'Crocodile', 'Dundee', 'lifelong', 'friend', 'superb', 'Michael', 'Caton', 'pose', 'life', 'partner', 'capitalize', 'new', 'tax', 'law', 'supporting', 'gay', 'couples', 'course', 'expected', 'coaching', 'local', 'male', 'hairdresser', 'who', 'really', 'straight', 'homosexuality', 'expected', 'trip', 'gay', 'bar', 'Syndey', 'where', 'bond', 'collection', 'fops', 'showdown', 'big', 'local', 'dance', 'movie', 'be', 'admired', 'refusal', 'fall', 'general', 'stereotypical', 'emotions', 'homsexuals', 'sensitivity', 'relationships', 'general', 'not', 'riotously', 'funny', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'Hogan', 'little', 'too', 'removed', 'film', 'be', 'effective', 'Caton', 'other', 'supporting', 'players', 'including', 'Pete', 'Postelthwaite', 'investigator', 'are', 'charming']",Strange Bedfellows

900776,A3EAU736LWTDCE,B00092ZMXY,sinisterfiend666,"[0, 6]","The only reason I rented this was because I have always liked Paul Hogan's work. I think the ""Crocodile Dundee"" series and ""Lightning Jack"" were both very funny\entertaining movies so I figured I would give this movie a try. I read the synopsis of the movie on the back of the DVD case, and it sounded funny. I was getting a mental image of Paul Hogan wearing a dress while doing cross-dressing slapstick comedy. I also seen the ""R"" rating and figured it would be adult humor (you know: probably corny, rude, crude bathroom jokes that some people might find offensive). Well, I got it home and it only took about 10 minutes for me to see that that it was a big disappointment. If you can believe it, the movie is actually way too serious. The humor is beyond dry, I found myself hardly laughing at all. Next, it was very boring. The story was too far fetched (which you expect from a comedy, but seeing how this isn't funny at all, it just adds to your frustration of watching it) There is no crafty one liners in the movie. Not even the story line itself is entertaining enough to keep your attention; and for the life of me, I also cannot figure out why it is R rated: there is no severe vulgar language in it. It's a PG-13 movie at best. Anyway, I literally turned the movie off a little over half way into it (right after the night club scene) I stopped caring what happens, I had no attachment what so ever to any of the characters, or their challenge to succeed at tax evasion.Verdict: I cannot believe people are giving this movie 4 and 5 stars. They must live a sheltered life, must be easily entertained, or they must find dry, jay leno type of humor funny (this is actually even worse than jay leno humor). This is the equivalent of watching paint dry at a cross dresser's house, and about as funny as having your knee caps broken. Bring a pillow!!! This is going to be a long haul!!
