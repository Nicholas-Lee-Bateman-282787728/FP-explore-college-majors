79287,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0788809806,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 3]","LOL Beany, here is one of those films we were talking about in the comment section of my `Yogi Bear' review; the kinds that don't deserve much explanation.  I feel that I need to now that I've been called out for not in that instance.What can be said though?I understand that the idea of `George of the Jungle' is to be stupid.  I get that.  I mean, anyone who saw the trailer for the film or was familiar with the original television series would be a fool to expect something more.  That being said, it doesn't give it a free pass from being criticized for offering nothing of substantial value.  I love my kids and I let them watch what makes them happy, I just prefer to put them in front of a film that not only makes them happy but doesn't slowly make them stupid in the process.  I just see no value in a film that is too lazy to pull itself out of the mindset that regurgitated pit falls and jokes about animal poop is enough to make a good `kids movie'.  It's not.  Brendan Fraser is goofy in a way that makes you cringe (kind of like his career) and Mann isn't much better (thank god her career took off in recent years).  The sad thing is that this could be something smarter and still get the laughs it thinks it is earning.  I mean, `George of the Jungle' is an obvious spoof on `Tarzan', but when you take to mocking a classic you have to be smart about it.  Why do you think so many parody films get torn to shreds by critics?  You have to think it through, and nothing about `George of the Jungle' is thought through in a way that creates anything worth noting.",1,Hit me with a tree and get it over with...,1340064000,"06 19, 2012",2012,1577,"['LOL', 'Beany', 'here', 'one', 'films', 'were', 'talking', 'comment', 'section', 'Yogi', 'Bear', 'review', 'kinds', 'do', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'much', 'explanation', 'feel', 'need', 'now', ""'ve"", 'been', 'called', 'out', 'not', 'instance.What', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'understand', 'idea', 'George', 'Jungle', 'be', 'stupid', 'get', 'mean', 'anyone', 'who', 'saw', 'trailer', 'film', 'was', 'familiar', 'original', 'television', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'fool', 'expect', 'something', 'more', 'being', 'said', ""n't"", 'give', 'free', 'pass', 'being', 'criticized', 'offering', 'nothing', 'substantial', 'value', 'love', 'kids', 'let', 'watch', 'what', 'happy', 'just', 'prefer', 'put', 'front', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'happy', ""n't"", 'slowly', 'make', 'stupid', 'process', 'just', 'see', 'value', 'film', 'too', 'lazy', 'pull', 'mindset', 'regurgitated', 'pit', 'falls', 'jokes', 'animal', 'poop', 'enough', 'make', 'good', 'kids', 'movie', 'not', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'goofy', 'way', 'cringe', 'kind', 'career', 'Mann', ""n't"", 'much', 'better', 'thank', 'god', 'career', 'took', 'off', 'recent', 'years', 'sad', 'thing', 'could', 'be', 'something', 'smarter', 'still', 'get', 'laughs', 'earning', 'mean', 'George', 'Jungle', 'obvious', 'spoof', 'Tarzan', 'when', 'take', 'mocking', 'classic', 'have', 'be', 'smart', 'Why', 'do', 'think', 'so', 'many', 'parody', 'films', 'get', 'torn', 'shreds', 'critics', 'have', 'think', 'nothing', 'George', 'Jungle', 'thought', 'way', 'anything', 'worth', 'noting']",N/A

George is shocked to discover that this fella' is a woman!Along the way, we get to see George fight a stuffed lion, see him play fetch with a little elephant (who reminds me of my Malemute), run into bridges and dress in flowing gowns.  We are treated to Ursula and Lyle's engagement party with a smashed cake and an absent Lyle, and where Ursula's mother threatens George, causing him to leave San Francisco.  Of course, we know how it ends- Tarzan always gets the girl, and this version is no different.There is nothing deep here for adults, but my young children find it fascinating.

79305,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,0788809806,Einsatz,"[0, 1]","I vaguely remember watching this as a cartoon in the 60s.  That Disney thought to turn it into a live action feature yet keep the cartoon sensibility/silliness is an odd choice but one that worked for them, as this was a box office hit at the time of its release.  Evidently, a lot of people enjoyed it.  I wish I could say I was one of them but I'm not.As expected, there is absolutely nothing sophisticated about this movie.  There are fart jokes and excrement humor throughout; it is entirely slapstick, based on a single malfunctioning rope trick.  The plot is long and belabored, dampened by a continuous narration that constantly interrupts with reassurances that no one dies; don't worry.  (It's a pity really, because I had several candidates in mind.)  Most of the acting consists of an alarming amount of smiling and acting mentally challenged.  There are several villains too many (a whole contingent shows up just for the final finale........there are several endings).  Admittedly, this movie isn't aimed at adults, children will probably love its many pratfalls, an elephant that thinks it's a dog, a talking ape...........

But with GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE, director Sam Weisman and screenwriters Dana Oldsen and Aubrey Wells bring the loony jungle hero to life and make it as much fun as a cartoon.  Brendan Fraser brings his physical and thespian assets to the role of George, a loveable lunk who manages to survive hitting hundreds of trees, and other assorted obstacles.  It's in the true spirit of the cartoons, indeed.  I also liked the narrator whose occasional forays into the action itself were fun and reminiscent of Fractured Fairy Tales, also a Jay Ward creation.  Lovely Leslie Mann (Last Man Standing) is a good Ursula, her prim socialite a perfect foil for the loveable George.  John Cleese adds his vocals to the role of Ape, the Ape, and it's a great addition.

If you are stuck having to pick which of the two to watch, see this w-a-y before you see Dudley Do Right. The film is about George of the Jungle, he looks for love in a girl named Ursilla, a woman from America and George just can not understand why he starts having all of these feelings for another person. His mate. John Clease does an OK job of playing the voice for the character An Ape Named Ape. Ape is George's mentor and guide through his life until he leaves the &quot;Heart of the Jungle.&quot;This is an over all good film, GREAT for kids.

LeBaron ""Todd LeBaron""","[1, 1]","I was absolutely thrilled when I heard that Disney had taken a cartoon I loved from the late 60s and given it the big screen treatment. Naturally, I expected it would die a quick death at the box office, and was delighted when it was actually a hit of some stature. It says something about a show that only had 17 episodes in its original run when so many people remember it as well as they do this many years later. The good news is, they stayed true to the spirit of how Jay Ward did the cartoon, right down to the discussions between the characters onscreen and the narrator (in this case a great impersonation and tribute to the late Paul Frees, one of animation's greatest voice-over people) and the requisite (not to mention obvious) really bad puns...and all the things that made the cartoon as funny and hip as it was back in 1967...they're all here in the movie. Don't look for War & Peace here, just a really enjoyable and funny movie for young and old alike that never gets risque or mean spirited. Brendan Fraser obviously enjoyed doing this (he must have or he wouldn't have played the starring role in Dudley Do-Right, another Jay Ward classic character)...John Cleese gave the perfect voice to the Ape character (very proper and British). This one's a loving tribute to the mad genius of Jay Ward. If you don't think so, you're overanalyzing it or you're looking too hard for meaning here. Get some popcorn, put this one in and get ready for some good laughs...and just try to get that theme song out of your head!",5,True to the spirit of the original!,1111881600,"03 27, 2005",2005,1529,"['was', 'absolutely', 'thrilled', 'when', 'heard', 'Disney', 'had', 'taken', 'cartoon', 'loved', 'late', '60s', 'given', 'big', 'screen', 'treatment', 'Naturally', 'expected', 'would', 'die', 'quick', 'death', 'box', 'office', 'was', 'delighted', 'when', 'was', 'actually', 'hit', 'stature', 'something', 'show', 'only', 'had', '17', 'episodes', 'original', 'run', 'when', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'remember', 'as', 'well', 'do', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'good', 'news', 'stayed', 'true', 'spirit', 'how', 'Jay', 'Ward', 'did', 'cartoon', 'right', 'down', 'discussions', 'characters', 'onscreen', 'narrator', 'case', 'great', 'impersonation', 'tribute', 'late', 'Paul', 'Frees', 'one', 'animation', 'greatest', 'voice-over', 'people', 'requisite', 'not', 'mention', 'obvious', 'really', 'bad', 'puns', 'things', 'made', 'cartoon', 'funny', 'hip', 'was', 'back', '1967', ""'re"", 'here', 'movie', 'Do', ""n't"", 'look', 'War', 'Peace', 'here', 'just', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'funny', 'movie', 'young', 'old', 'alike', 'never', 'risque', 'mean', 'spirited', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'obviously', 'enjoyed', 'doing', 'must', 'have', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'played', 'starring', 'role', 'Dudley', 'Do-Right', 'Jay', 'Ward', 'classic', 'character', 'John', 'Cleese', 'gave', 'perfect', 'voice', 'Ape', 'character', 'very', 'proper', 'British', 'one', 'loving', 'tribute', 'mad', 'genius', 'Jay', 'Ward', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', ""'re"", 'overanalyzing', ""'re"", 'looking', 'too', 'hard', 'meaning', 'here', 'Get', 'popcorn', 'put', 'one', 'get', 'ready', 'good', 'laughs', 'just', 'try', 'get', 'theme', 'song', 'head']",N/A
