1618732,A3KUJRUJV0N9L4,B00AZMFG48,"Alejandro A. Reyes ""Knowledge Warrior""","[3, 4]","Brilliant documentary laying out a set of social injustices in 1989 New York City.  I remember being roughly the same age as these 5 teenagers and in high school in Brooklyn when it happened.  I recall my history teacher pulling out the newspaper and showing us the front page with the headshots of these kids and the term &#34;wilding&#34; appearing in large bold letters.  I also remembered sitting next to a black classmate and both of us discussing how the kids were all black and Hispanic.  This in a predominately black and Hispanic high school and I remember the awkwardly tense environment this popular case created in my school among the student body.  The film even dealt with that in a very straight forward manner that I very much appreciated.  That&#8217;s an easy thing for people to want to shy away from and it takes some courage to admit it and bring it to light.Another thing this film portrays is how the police and district attorneys regarded these kids as guilty from the beginning before it even reached the newspapers.  Then they became guilty in the eyes of the media, which then landed the final blow by creating the same guilty conclusion in the minds of much of the public.  &#34;The Crime of the Century&#34; it was called.  And in the end of it all, it turns out they were actually innocent.  So I guess it was the crime of the century---just not one perpetrated by these kids, but instead the one perpetrated by the system.The original case received so much media attention in 1989 that I think it was impossible to not hear something about it and this was the days before the internet and easy 24-hour access to news.  Meanwhile, when a black woman was raped and thrown off of a roof in Brooklyn on the same day, it got very little attention.  The racial implications in this Central Park jogger case were very disturbing and well elucidated in the film.Taking 5 14-16 year old kids and coercing them into giving false statements of guilt just to close a case under pressure.  It sadly also resulted in the actual guilty person to roam free and commit more rapes while these innocent kids were being convicted.This is an incredibly sad tale and I had been wanting to see this film since it first came out in theaters.  It brought back a lot of memories.  It is tragic indeed and not something that should be forgotten, but unfortunately their exoneration got very little attention so most people from the time I&#8217;m sure have no idea of how this all turned out.  I didn&#8217;t even know until I heard of this film, which was 23 years later.The film is an important film for that reason.  It is the greatest public statement of the injustice that was carried out in a number of different ways by different criminal justice departments of our system.  Legendary documentarian Ken Burns and his daughter Sara, as well as her husband, did an excellent job of bringing the social/political implications and ramifications to light with both heart and a commitment to factual rigor.This film really should be watch by many more people, especially those of us from this time period.

1618746,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B00AZMFG48,Doug Park,"[0, 0]","I remember the skeptical tone of one news report I read in 2002, when the Central Park Five (""CP5"") were exonerated due to Matias Reyes's confession to the 1989 assault and rape of Trisha Meili. The majority of people (including myself) who gave the story a cursory glance seemed doubtful about a serial rapist who was already serving a life sentence--i.e., with nothing left to lose by making a false confession--meeting one of the CP5 by chance in prison and taking the blame in order to clear the names of several young men who must have been properly convicted some years earlier. ""What did Reyes get in return?"" many of us wondered, ignoring the facts that all of the CP5 had already completed their sentences for the rape and near-murder of Meili--though one of them was incarcerated for a later drug trafficking offense and just happened to meet Reyes in prison--and that Reyes's DNA matched the profile found at the crime scene.THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE is very important in showing the other side of the story. It definitely has its slant, as any documentary will, but it makes a strong argument for the basic fact that five teenaged boys were convicted solely because of coerced and contradictory confessions to the crime after hours of being interrogated and played off against one another with a complete disregard for the lack of direct evidence against them. It clearly shows how this can and does happen far more often than many of us want to think. It's also very revealing of how dangerous public emotion and outrage, regardless of its focus, can be.Unfortunately, the NYPD, the prosecutors in the case, and everyone else responsible for the convictions declined to speak to Directors Ken and Sarah Burns, which is very telling but also limits the scope of the film. THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE is dominated by interviews with the CP5 and their relatives, obviously a crucial ingredient, but it becomes repetitive. There are, however, important comments from then-Mayor Ed Koch, who was all for conviction and serious punishment of the CP5 in 1989 but has now apparently changed his mind. The brief input by NYC historian Craig Steven Wilder and several others also adds a great deal.One of the strongest aspects of THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE is the brief sociological perspective of New York City's racially polarized, have/have-not environment during the 1970s and 80s. Not only is it elucidating in its own right, it also provides background and something in the way of explanation for the wrongful conviction of the CP5.Some of the more negative reviews have criticized THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE for being simply ""boring,"" and at the risk of sounding crass, I see what they mean. While this is an important miscarriage of justice that should not be ignored, the repetitiveness and narrow scope of the film will inevitably limit its mass appeal. Anyone with a serious interest in this case and wrongful convictions in general, however, will probably find its two-hour length well-worth sitting through.More analysis of the details that led to the wrongful convictions would have been helpful, e.g., the term ""wilding."" [One of the CP5 confessed to police that he and a number of others were ""wilding"" in Central Park on the night of the crime.] The term ""wilding"" is roughly equivalent to ""raising hell,"" the usual term-of-choice when I was a kid in the late '70s/early '80s. ""Raising hell"" could, of course, refer to anything from driving fast, drinking beer, and talking loudly and irreverently (as we meant it) to violent felonies. More discussion of how  misinterpretations of the loose term ""wilding"" were a critical factor in the conviction would have added some depth to this documentary.",4,"""I just wanted to go home""",1392249600,"02 13, 2014",2014,3696,"['remember', 'skeptical', 'tone', 'one', 'news', 'report', 'read', '2002', 'when', 'Central', 'Park', 'Five', 'CP5', 'were', 'exonerated', 'due', 'Matias', 'Reyes', 'confession', '1989', 'assault', 'rape', 'Trisha', 'Meili', 'majority', 'people', 'including', 'who', 'gave', 'story', 'cursory', 'glance', 'seemed', 'doubtful', 'serial', 'rapist', 'who', 'was', 'already', 'serving', 'life', 'sentence', 'i.e.', 'nothing', 'left', 'lose', 'making', 'false', 'confession', 'meeting', 'one', 'CP5', 'chance', 'prison', 'taking', 'blame', 'order', 'clear', 'names', 'several', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'properly', 'convicted', 'years', 'earlier', 'What', 'did', 'Reyes', 'get', 'return', 'many', 'wondered', 'ignoring', 'facts', 'CP5', 'had', 'already', 'completed', 'sentences', 'rape', 'near-murder', 'Meili', 'one', 'was', 'incarcerated', 'later', 'drug', 'trafficking', 'offense', 'just', 'happened', 'meet', 'Reyes', 'prison', 'Reyes', 'DNA', 'matched', 'profile', 'found', 'crime', 'scene.THE', 'CENTRAL', 'PARK', 'FIVE', 'very', 'important', 'showing', 'other', 'side', 'story', 'definitely', 'slant', 'documentary', 'will', 'strong', 'argument', 'basic', 'fact', 'five', 'teenaged', 'boys', 'were', 'convicted', 'solely', 'coerced', 'contradictory', 'confessions', 'crime', 'hours', 'being', 'interrogated', 'played', 'off', 'one', 'complete', 'disregard', 'lack', 'direct', 'evidence', 'clearly', 'how', 'can', 'happen', 'far', 'more', 'often', 'many', 'want', 'think', 'also', 'very', 'revealing', 'how', 'dangerous', 'public', 'emotion', 'outrage', 'regardless', 'focus', 'can', 'be.Unfortunately', 'NYPD', 'prosecutors', 'case', 'everyone', 'else', 'responsible', 'convictions', 'declined', 'speak', 'Directors', 'Ken', 'Sarah', 'Burns', 'very', 'telling', 'also', 'scope', 'film', 'CENTRAL', 'PARK', 'FIVE', 'dominated', 'interviews', 'CP5', 'relatives', 'obviously', 'crucial', 'ingredient', 'repetitive', 'are', 'however', 'important', 'comments', 'then-Mayor', 'Ed', 'Koch', 'who', 'was', 'conviction', 'serious', 'punishment', 'CP5', '1989', 'now', 'apparently', 'changed', 'mind', 'brief', 'input', 'NYC', 'historian', 'Craig', 'Steven', 'Wilder', 'several', 'others', 'also', 'great', 'deal.One', 'strongest', 'aspects', 'THE', 'CENTRAL', 'PARK', 'FIVE', 'brief', 'sociological', 'perspective', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'racially', 'polarized', 'have/have-not', 'environment', '1970s', '80s', 'Not', 'only', 'elucidating', 'own', 'right', 'also', 'background', 'something', 'way', 'explanation', 'wrongful', 'conviction', 'CP5.Some', 'more', 'negative', 'reviews', 'have', 'criticized', 'THE', 'CENTRAL', 'PARK', 'FIVE', 'being', 'simply', 'boring', 'risk', 'sounding', 'crass', 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'important', 'miscarriage', 'justice', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'ignored', 'repetitiveness', 'narrow', 'scope', 'film', 'will', 'inevitably', 'limit', 'mass', 'appeal', 'Anyone', 'serious', 'interest', 'case', 'wrongful', 'convictions', 'general', 'however', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'two-hour', 'length', 'well-worth', 'sitting', 'through.More', 'analysis', 'details', 'led', 'wrongful', 'convictions', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'helpful', 'e.g.', 'term', 'wilding', 'One', 'CP5', 'confessed', 'police', 'number', 'others', 'were', 'wilding', 'Central', 'Park', 'night', 'crime', ']', 'term', 'wilding', 'roughly', 'equivalent', 'raising', 'hell', 'usual', 'term-of-choice', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'late', ""'70s/early"", 'Raising', 'hell', 'could', 'course', 'refer', 'anything', 'driving', 'fast', 'drinking', 'beer', 'talking', 'loudly', 'irreverently', 'meant', 'violent', 'felonies', 'More', 'discussion', 'how', 'misinterpretations', 'loose', 'term', 'wilding', 'were', 'critical', 'factor', 'conviction', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'depth', 'documentary']",The Central Park Five

1618749,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,B00AZMFG48,Edwin C. Pauzer,"[13, 19]","In the early evening hours of April 19, 1988, a 28 year old investment banker named Trisha Meili was jogging in Central Park when she was attacked and brutally raped. Several suspects were brought in for questioning who described their activities that night as ""wilding,"" slang for making mischief in the form of assault, robbery and general hooliganism in the park. With the young woman in a coma and not expected to live, the five Hispanic and black youths were quickly rounded up by a Police Department that was under pressure to find the hoodlums and bring the case to justice.Adding fuel to the fire was Donald Trump, never missing a moment for self-promotion, put out full page ads in the major New York newspapers calling for a reinstituted death penalty. Former Mayor Ed Koch helped contaminate the jury pool by saying in front of the camera ""we have to call them suspects"" implying that it was a nicety applied to the guilty. Even the mainstream media jumped on the bandwagon publishing the names and the addresses of the suspects, even those that were under-age. Minority newspapers retaliated outraging white New Yorkers by publishing the name of the victim.  The pictures of the guilt- and shame-ridden faces revealed their guilt to everyone white. It was a D.W. Griffiths nightmare-- the evil black men were raping ""our white women,"" just as portrayed in the movie that glorified the Ku Klux Klan a hundred years earlier.Interrogated hour after hour, each suspect was worn down from the coaxing and cajoling, finally admitting to the crime or implicating someone with them in the belief that they could go home if they just confessed. The parents, as ignorant of the judicial process as their offspring, encouraged them to confess. To their surprise indictments followed, but that was only part of the nightmare. One parent hired a divorce and real estate lawyer to defend her son. One of the defendant's lawyers slept threw some of the testimony.  And while judges in criminal cases are generally chosen by the name falling out of a tumbler, a judge was assigned to the case, a judge who had the reputation for siding with prosecutors. Couple all these phenomena with the power of confessions, the fate of the defendants was sealed even though the D.A. had no physical evidence that put any of them at the scene of the crime.Fate, career and relationships often turn on coincidences, and sometimes justice does too. It is clear that the five would have served out their entire sentences because they were unwilling to admit to any parole board that they committed the crime. But one of the five saw Matias Reyes, another inmate in prison. Reyes sensing trouble from their previous meetings on Rikers Island was surprised when he held out his hand to Reyes in friendship.Now for the confession that really mattered. Touched by the offer of friendship, Reyes confessed to the crime, and gave New York City detectives details that weren't released to the public. The real coup d' grace was that his D.N.A was a perfect match to that found on the victim. A timeline search by reporters discovered that the Central Park Five could not have been in the same place as the jogger who followed a routine workout and route schedule.The five were set free and tell their story here. Ken Burns once again demonstrates his talent for documentaries that is sobering, shameful, enlightening.  You feel the deep sense of loss that each felt at the injustice that robbed them of years of their lives. As one said, by this time in his life, he should have been married, had kids, and living in his own home. He wonders where to go to get his life back. And while any one of us will deny that our search for justice was racist, one woman who was interviewed asked: ""Would anyone have noticed if it was a black woman who was raped in Harlem?""This is powerful and disturbing.Update:Several personalities come in for a roasting which includes conservative pundit, author and lawyer, Ann Coulter who claimed in her book, ""Demonic,"" that liberals are only interested in the rule of law when it comes to protecting criminals. Coulter, of course, uses the Central Park Five as her example. Coulter wailed and gnashed the following in a column: ""Consider only the odds of a false confession leading to a conviction. If the judge believes a confession is not an expression of free will, the confession will be thrown out. If the jury believes a confession is not an expression of free will, the confession will be thrown out. If an appeals court finds the confession was not voluntary, it will be thrown out. If the police fail to read the suspect his Miranda rights, the confession will be thrown out. If the defendant lyingly [sic] claims he was not read his Miranda rights and gets some appeals court to believe him, the confession will be thrown out. If the police question a juvenile outside the presence of his parents, the confession will be thrown out.""Not so fast, Goldilocks!1) There are plenty of examples of people making false confessions and being convicted.2) Confessions are a powerful influence with juries. In many cases juries will ignore or dismiss evidence that contradicts the confession. This jury did with the exception of one who held out until he was browbeaten into changing his verdict.3) Coulter ignores that Reyes' DNA was a perfect match with semen found on the jogger.4) As one blogger wrote the Police videotaped the confessions, not the questions.5) The Police treated this almost as a murder, having homicide detectives investigate the case instead of sex crimes detectives.6) The Police discovered the DNA several years before and did nothing about it.Donald Trump tweeted ""What were the Central Park Five doing in the park?"" There are two possibilities: a) they had no business being in the park because they're black and Hispanic, which makes perfect sense if one thinks like a racist, or b) it was none of Trump's  business. He deleted his tweet shortly after. It looks like the Donald wanted to be thought of as a ""b"" rather than as a first class ""A.""Matias Reyes went on to rape more women and even killed one in the time of the arrest of the Central Park Five and their incarceration.Mayor Bloomberg refuses to settle a lawsuit brought by the Central Park Five. Could it be if the city did, they would or could be sued by the families of Matias' other rape victims?",5,Powerful and Disturbing,1368057600,"05 9, 2013",2013,6393,"['early', 'evening', 'hours',

The stories about ""wilding"" where gangs of inner city youth were running amok and terrorizing citizens was like something out of a horror movie.  At the time, I was probably about the same age as some of those young men who were convicted.  I saw their pictures on television and condemned them due to the stories that were being reported by supposedly reputable news agencies.  Watching this movie made me realize how easily I accepted the idea of their guilt due to my own prejudicial ideas.  They were young, black or Hispanic men from a rough section of New York who were confessing to commiting the crime.  If the group had been white guys from Manhattan, would everyone have been so quick to condemn them?  Of course not.  The horror that all of the young men have been through is inexcusable.  There was too much conflicting testimony during their trials.  It should have at least raised questions in the prosecutors minds but they needed a culprit or culprits to convict and it was easier to ignore what didn't fit than to try and explain it.  While the convictions were overturned, nothing can ever repay the five for the years they lost.  All seem to have moved on as much as was possible but their pain is still so obvious as you hear them tell their stories.  This film is moving and I hope in some small way helps the Five to regain part of the faith in humanity that was taken from them.  If you're 40 or over, you need to watch this to understand how our justice system went so wrong.  If you're younger, you need to watch this film to see the injustice of our history so that we don't repeat it.  In other words, everyone over the age of 15 or 16 should see this film.I understand that the five are now suing the City of New York for their mishandling of this case.

1618753,A15RATHAZNE9XH,B00AZMFG48,Francine Long,"[1, 3]","The kids apprehended for the Central Park Jogger Rape and their families are interviewed about getting railroaded into &#34;confessing&#34; to the crime. I am convinced that this happens after seeing a lot of police interrogation videotapes on true crime TV shows. I thought suspects could just say they want an attorney present before answering any more questions, but I can see how a naive kid would be intimidated. That said, the interviews got rather repetitive and the view point extremely one-sided. It left me wondering just what were these kids doing out there at night given the lawlessness and mob violence that was a regular occurrence in Central Park during the 1980's.

This co-documentary is directed by the book's author as well as David McMahon and Ken Burns (yes, that Ken Burns).""The Central Park Five"" (120 min.) brings in excruciating (but riveting and enraging) details the background of the infamous ""Central Park jogger"" case of a woman who was savagely attacked, raped and left for dead while jogging in New York's Central Park in 1989. By coincidence that very same evening a bunch of black and latino 14 and 15 yr. old teenagers were hanging out in Central Park and pretty quickly the New York police rounded up a number of them, eventually causing 5 of them to admit to a crime they did not commit. This of course then goes to the very heart of this documentary: why did the 5 innocent teenagers confess to a crime they did not commit? Just watch!Several comments: first and foremost, this documentary is clearly the result of painstaking background work into the details of the case. The initial part of the documentary does a great job setting the table of what New York was like in the late 80s (pre-law and order days of Rudolph Giuliani's administration in the 90s). The documentary also gives some amazing insights on why the media were not more thorough and critical while covering the case and the trial (one of the interviewees is a New York Times reporter who basically admits that 'we failed to do our job'). Also appalling is the dumbfounding absence of a strong legal defense during the trial, when not a single lawyer for the defendants points out that it was physically impossible for the teenagers to be at the spot of the crime when the crime happened. And on and on. This movie is gathering strong buzz, and hence I was surprised that it did not get an Oscar nomination for Best Documentary.

1618792,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00AZMFG48,Turfseer,"[64, 103]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'The Central Park Five' is noted documentarian Ken Burns' take on the infamous arrest, subsequent trial and eventual legal exoneration of five minority youths accused in the assault and rape of a Central Park jogger in 1989. It's Burns' position that in a haste to make arrests, the investigating detectives and representatives from the NYC DA's office, 'force fed' their own versions of events and 'coerced' the youths to make statements implicating themselves, both in written and (in some of the defendants' cases) videotaped confessions. Burns is also satisfied with the confession of serial killer Matias Reyes, who claimed he acted alone and whose DNA was linked directly to the Central Park jogger.For those looking for easy answers, 'The Central Park Five' upon first glance seems to tie things up quite nicely, making the case that the five youths were victims not only of a police and DA's office 'rush to judgment', but of being victims of the racism endemic in society as a whole. Burns trots out the five victims who all seem fairly articulate and reasonable as they recount their stories from their perspective as adults.One of the problems that Burns fails to explore in enough detail is that the Central Park Five (CPF) were not only convicted of rape (in most cases) but also assaulting other people in the park that night. Burns and the CPF want you to believe that they merely observed two serious assaults in the park and acted 'shocked' by the brutality of the mob. The CPF all insisted during the documentary, that they were not guilty and that's why they all refused to accept a plea bargain from the DA's office prior to trial. Nonetheless, on February 9, 1994, at his PAROLE HEARING, Raymond Santana (one of the CPF) denied the rape but READILY ADMITTED that he and seven or eight of his friends planned to go to the park to rob and assault people. He also admitted that they let one man go because he was with his girlfriend and also admitted (he himself) had beat a man.When Anton McCray went before the parole board, in November 1994, he also admitted all the crimes in the park except the rape. In 2002, Kevin Richardson and Santana were interviewed by detectives and they both admitted their participation in the assaults but not the rapes. Just as an example, 23 people were identified as participating on the assault of a victim, Antonio Diaz in the park. Numerous accomplices implicated all five defendants; both Richardson and McCray admitted participation and Salaam and Wise, admitted being present and Santana observed some ""commotion"" in the distance. Not a word from Burns on these facts as it's clear he doesn't want to tarnish the image of the Central Park Five, as it looks a lot better if they're depicted as total and complete victims and not individuals who might be capable of violence. Of course some will say, even if the Central Park Five committed assaults, it doesn't make them rapists. But Burns doesn't even let on that the CPF might be guilty of ANYTHING!Another fact about the case that Burns conveniently ignores is that only two of the CPF, Richardson and Santana, were actually arrested in the park. How is it, that the other three were eventually linked to the two found in the park? Long before the alleged 'coercion' during the DA interviews, there was obvious PROBABLE CAUSE to arrest the other three. That's because when police initially encountered the mob of kids, only Santana (and separately charged Stephen Lopez), remained at the scene. They were observed to be 'wide-eyed' and in 'shock'. Richardson fled and was apprehended. On the way to the precinct, Richardson (and another youth, Clarence Thomas) both fingered McCray as the 'murderer'. Statements by Richardson and others implicated both Santana and Lopez as being part of the mob. Later, the other three were linked by Richardson and Santana, as well as other witnesses, to each other.In watching 'The Central Park Five', you'll get the distinct impression that the defendants were 'railroaded'; that there was no opportunity for them to dispute their allegations that the initial arrest was invalid, their statements were obtained by trickery or outright deception, the Family Court Act and Criminal Procedure Law provisions mandating parental notification and presence during questioning were not followed, false promises were made that they would be released, physical force was used and they were deprived of food and sleep. In reality, there was a six week pre-trial hearing involving testimony from twenty-nine prosecution witnesses, testimony from Wise, Richardson, Santana and Salaam, Lopez, parents, siblings, relatives and friends of the defendants. Judge Galligan found, except for one instance, there were no grounds to suppress any of the statements or evidence taken from the statements. You can read about all the motions the defense submitted in their attempt to suppress evidence and why almost all of their motions failed. It's chronicled in this special report at Findlaw.com commissioned by the Police Commissioner for the purpose of determining whether the new evidence indicated that police supervisors or officers acted improperly or incorrectly: news.findlaw.com/cnn/docs/cpjgr/nypd12703jgrrpt.pdf.Despite all the claims during the documentary that the CPF were ""coerced"", only Kharey Wise claimed he was ""fed"" answers. As the prosecutor pointed out during the trial, ""McCray testified that the police said he should put himself in it, and that was all the information that was given to Antron McCray about what he was supposed to put in his statement."" If Burns is guilty of the sin of omission, he's on far shakier ground when he asserts as fact, that there was some kind of 'time line' that contradicted the police and DA version of events. The Findlaw report concluded otherwise: ""In fact, no accurate time line can be constructed because the evidence regarding the timing of the various events and the individuals who participated in them is not sufficiently precise to allow any exact conclusion.""There's plenty more in the report commissioned by the Police Department including collaboration by outside witnesses (and not just the defendants themselves), that the CPF were involved in the assault on the jogger.  One such witness, Melody Jackson, was a sister of one of Kharey Wises' friends, Corey. After the pre-trial hearing, she told the police that she was at her sister's house when she took a call from Wise from Riker's Island, who admitted that he held the jogger's legs down while Richardson sexually assaulted her.  Jackson thought this information would be helpful to Wise (obviously unaware that by placing Wise at the scene, he could be charged with rape).  Not only did she testify at the trial but in 2002, she re-confirmed her statement.  Jackson also explained that by inculpating Wise, it had a negative effect on her for the rest of her life (her community obviously regarded her as a 'traitor').  Here is somebody who had everything to lose by telling the truth about what Wise told her, but she continued to stick to her story, even years later!'The Central Park Five' is the 'Mickey Mouse' version of what happened. In reality, the entire story is extremely complex. Read the report at the Findlaw site if you're interested in DETAILS. Otherwise, watch Burns' sanitized version. A civil lawsuit is still pending, with all defendants seeking compensation. If they can prove their case, they deserve all the compensation in the world. Let the chips fall where they may.UPDATE: New York City's left-leaning Mayor has now given the Central Park Five the payday they were looking for.  Doubts still remain.  Significantly the NY Post reported this in their 6-20-14 edition: In 2002, a judge granted a motion to vacate the 13-year-old convictions after a serial rapist who was already in jail said he committed the crime, a confession backed up by DNA evidence. The Wall Street Journal, however, reported Thursday that two doctors who treated Meili said in recent interviews that some of her wounds were not consistent with Matias Reyes' account of the attack. The revelation castes doubt on the claim that Reyes was the only attacker.",2,"Burns' 'Mickey Mouse', sanitized version of events will impress those who eschew complexity",1358640000,"01 20,
