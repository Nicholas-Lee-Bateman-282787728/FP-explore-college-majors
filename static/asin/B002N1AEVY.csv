1278768,A1UHKF1UQ3EGW4,B002N1AEVY,Charles H. Thompson III,"[26, 38]","This movie has a very good story line about being content with the life you have instead of wishing you had someone else's life. The one thing I want to mention is that the cover says, ""Family Approved"" and it really is not. The movie takes God's name in vain several times, characters say ass and hell, the main woman wears revealing clevage and short skirts, and there is a scene where a man in a towel is coming onto the main character to have sex with her. I am disappointed in the ""Family Approved"" seal that I have come to trust in choosing movies.",3,Family Approved?,1259539200,"11 30, 2009",2009,554,"['movie', 'very', 'good', 'story', 'line', 'being', 'content', 'life', 'have', 'instead', 'wishing', 'had', 'someone', 'else', 'life', 'one', 'thing', 'want', 'mention', 'cover', 'Family', 'Approved', 'really', 'not', 'movie', 'God', 'name', 'vain', 'several', 'times', 'characters', 'say', 'ass', 'hell', 'main', 'woman', 'revealing', 'clevage', 'short', 'skirts', 'scene', 'where', 'man', 'towel', 'coming', 'main', 'character', 'have', 'sex', 'am', 'disappointed', 'Family', 'Approved', 'seal', 'have', 'come', 'trust', 'choosing', 'movies']",N/A

It's become the theme of hundreds of other Christmas movies. Frankly, I think audiences are becoming sick of it. It's fine to preach that people should appreciate their lives, but adult life is more complex than shown in these films.The Christmas Clausetries too hard to preach the virtues of family life, but instead comes across as unoriginal. Part of the problem is that the acting is lousy. Lea Thompson sounds like she's repeating her lines rather than engaged in emotional dialogue. I just couldn't get excited about it or the story - especially when there are so many other great Christmas movies to watch, likeIt's a Wonderful Life.",2,Cliche theme and lousy acting,1261267200,"12 20, 2009",2009,775,"['hate', 'pile', 'butThe', 'Christmas', 'Clausecertainly', 'was', 'disappointment', 'whole', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'just', 'boring', 'cliche', 'become', 'theme', 'hundreds', 'other', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'Frankly', 'think', 'audiences', 'are', 'becoming', 'sick', 'fine', 'preach', 'people', 'should', 'appreciate', 'lives', 'adult', 'life', 'more', 'complex', 'shown', 'films.The', 'Christmas', 'Clausetries', 'too', 'hard', 'preach', 'virtues', 'family', 'life', 'instead', 'across', 'unoriginal', 'Part', 'problem', 'acting', 'lousy', 'Lea', 'Thompson', 'repeating', 'lines', 'rather', 'engaged', 'emotional', 'dialogue', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'excited', 'story', 'especially', 'when', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'great', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'watch', 'Wonderful', 'Life']",N/A

You know how it's going to end before it even starts. You know the main character is shallow in the beginning and sees the error of his/her ways by the end and you know that the Angel or whatever will make it right in the end. Come on, these movies are just supposed to make you feel good. This wasn't the best of those theme movies but it's not the worst.
