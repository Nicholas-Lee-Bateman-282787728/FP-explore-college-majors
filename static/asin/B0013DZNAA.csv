1141506,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B0013DZNAA,Bobby Underwood,"[31, 32]","It took some time for this show to find its footing and decide exactly what it wanted to be. Many expecting it to be very dark like ""Profiler"" or intricately technical like ""C.S.I."" gave up on it too soon. The pilot episode offered a lot of background and insight into Jordan Cavanaugh (Jill Hennessey). She was smart and pretty, and terribly messed up, haunted by demons from her childhood. She was also relentless in her pursuit of justice.Once she left L.A. for Boston, joining the M.E.'s office, she gradually found a home. By the middle of season one, the show knew what it was and many were glad they'd hung around. It became this wonderfully cool show about a small group of people in the medical examiner's office, Jill Hennessy at its center, who had formed a kind of familial bond as they dealt with crimes and their personal problems. In Jordan's case, who was searching for her mother's killer, the two often intertwined.There was a lot of quirky humor and fun mixed in with the darker elements, making for a great show. There was also a fine ensemble cast. Miguel Ferrer as Jordan's boss, Katherine Hahn as the always ""glass half full"" Lily, and Jerry O'Connell as Woody, the cop often at odds with Jordan, but sort of loving every minute of it, all brought something to the show's dynamic. Ken Howard was also good as Jordan's estranged father. But it was really Steve Valentine's Nigel and Ravi Kapoor's ""Bug"" and their interactions with Jordan which made the show special.They bickered, got in trouble, covered for each other, and generally had a life and a family thanks to each other. Crossing Jordan really hit its stride with the two-part ""Digger"" story arc. It cemented the show to its core audience, who stayed from then on. Followed by the very good ""Blue Christmas"" episode, it had finally discovered the perfect mix of crime and quirky humor and personal woes. It was both the dark and the light.One of the great things about the show was the music. An eclectic mix of songs was often used for atmosphere, which could run from noir to hilarity in less time than it took to make a fun reference to Elvis. From the middle of season one to the end of season two, this was great television. You could never put it in in a nice little box, pegging it as this kind of show or that. It was simply Crossing Jordan.Here are the episodes for season one:  Pilot, The Dawn of a New Day, The Ties That Bind, Born to Run, You Can't Go Home Again, Believers, Digger, Part I, Digger, Part II, Blue Christmas, Wrong Place, Wrong Time, Blood Relatives, Miracles & Wonders, Four Fathers, Acts of Mercy, Lost and Found, Crime & Punishment, With Honor, For Harry, with Love and Squalor, The Gift of Life, Someone to Count On, Secrets & Lies, Secrets & Lies, Part IIWith everything on television seeming the same, Crossing Jordan was different. Many episodes and story lines were interconnected. You never got the full story from just occasionally tuning in for a peak. It required some attention and time. It was what made the show work, and its downfall in later seasons when it tried to fit in more. Seasons one and two were terrific, however, and something a bit different for TV fans to own.",5,The Dark and Light,1211673600,"05 25, 2008",2008,3199,"['took', 'time', 'show', 'find', 'footing', 'decide', 'exactly', 'what', 'wanted', 'be', 'Many', 'expecting', 'be', 'very', 'dark', 'Profiler', 'intricately', 'technical', 'C.S.I', 'gave', 'up', 'too', 'soon', 'pilot', 'episode', 'offered', 'lot', 'background', 'insight', 'Jordan', 'Cavanaugh', 'Jill', 'Hennessey', 'was', 'smart', 'pretty', 'terribly', 'messed', 'up', 'haunted', 'demons', 'childhood', 'was', 'also', 'relentless', 'pursuit', 'justice.Once', 'left', 'L.A.', 'Boston', 'joining', 'M.E', 'office', 'gradually', 'found', 'home', 'middle', 'season', 'one', 'show', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'many', 'were', 'glad', ""'d"", 'hung', 'around', 'became', 'wonderfully', 'cool', 'show', 'small', 'group', 'people', 'medical', 'examiner', 'office', 'Jill', 'Hennessy', 'center', 'who', 'had', 'formed', 'kind', 'familial', 'bond', 'dealt', 'crimes', 'personal', 'problems', 'Jordan', 'case', 'who', 'was', 'searching', 'mother', 'killer', 'two', 'often', 'intertwined.There', 'was', 'lot', 'quirky', 'humor', 'fun', 'mixed', 'darker', 'elements', 'making', 'great', 'show', 'was', 'also', 'fine', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Miguel', 'Ferrer', 'Jordan', 'boss', 'Katherine', 'Hahn', 'always', 'glass', 'half', 'full', 'Lily', 'Jerry', ""O'Connell"", 'Woody', 'cop', 'often', 'odds', 'Jordan', 'sort', 'loving', 'minute', 'brought', 'something', 'show', 'dynamic', 'Ken', 'Howard', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'Jordan', 'estranged', 'father', 'was', 'really', 'Steve', 'Valentine', 'Nigel', 'Ravi', 'Kapoor', 'Bug', 'interactions', 'Jordan', 'made', 'show', 'special.They', 'bickered', 'got', 'trouble', 'covered', 'other', 'generally', 'had', 'life', 'family', 'thanks', 'other', 'Crossing', 'Jordan', 'really', 'hit', 'stride', 'two-part', 'Digger', 'story', 'arc', 'cemented', 'show', 'core', 'audience', 'who', 'stayed', 'then', 'Followed', 'very', 'good', 'Blue', 'Christmas', 'episode', 'had', 'finally', 'discovered', 'perfect', 'mix', 'crime', 'quirky', 'humor', 'personal', 'woes', 'was', 'dark', 'light.One', 'great', 'things', 'show', 'was', 'music', 'eclectic', 'mix', 'songs', 'was', 'often', 'used', 'atmosphere', 'could', 'run', 'noir', 'hilarity', 'less', 'time', 'took', 'make', 'fun', 'reference', 'Elvis', 'middle', 'season', 'one', 'end', 'season', 'two', 'was', 'great', 'television', 'could', 'never', 'put', 'nice', 'little', 'box', 'pegging', 'kind', 'show', 'was', 'simply', 'Crossing', 'Jordan.Here', 'are', 'episodes', 'season', 'one', 'Pilot', 'Dawn', 'New', 'Day', 'Ties', 'Bind', 'Born', 'Run', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Go', 'Home', 'Again', 'Believers', 'Digger', 'Part', 'Digger', 'Part', 'II', 'Blue', 'Christmas', 'Wrong', 'Place', 'Wrong', 'Time', 'Blood', 'Relatives', 'Miracles', 'Wonders', 'Four', 'Fathers', 'Acts', 'Mercy', 'Lost', 'Found', 'Crime', 'Punishment', 'Honor', 'Harry', 'Love', 'Squalor', 'Gift', 'Life', 'Someone', 'Count', 'Secrets', 'Lies', 'Secrets', 'Lies', 'Part', 'IIWith', 'everything', 'television', 'seeming', 'same', 'Crossing', 'Jordan', 'was', 'different', 'Many', 'episodes', 'story', 'lines', 'were', 'interconnected', 'never', 'got', 'full', 'story', 'just', 'occasionally', 'tuning', 'peak', 'required', 'attention', 'time', 'was', 'what', 'made', 'show', 'work', 'downfall', 'later', 'seasons', 'when', 'tried', 'fit', 'more', 'Seasons', 'one', 'two', 'were', 'terrific', 'however', 'something', 'bit', 'different', 'TV', 'fans', 'own']",Crossing Jordan: Season 1

It was just that good and I am still royally peeved at NBC for canceling it without even a heads up!!!  They left us all hanging and anxiously waiting for the new season to arrive and then bam!! it was cancelled.  So boooo to NBC forever for that.  Now on to how great this show is, I liked averything about this show, the science, the drama, the comedic spots that were woven into it.  Each actor was brilliant in their role and I really miss them alot.  I don't really like to get up at 5 a.m. to watch reruns on A&E, so I at least have the first season on dvd to watch anytime.  My next beef is when are the rest of the seasons going to be released??  I think we fans have been more than reasonably patient about waiting for at least the second season to arrive, but this is getting ridiculous.  Give us any word, please.  Amazon, you are a saviour, it is not easy to find certain dvd sets that I want in my area, and the nearest large department store is over two hours away, so you have excellent quality products and at a really nice price too.

Ive seen shows and Movies and Loved the soundtracks and have gone out to buy them or purchased them from Amazon, and have looked/bought other stuff for the actors/actresses that Ive seen in the various shows, so whats the difference in them being seen/heard on TV and yet not on DVD/BluRay/or even VHS Tape?

Somehow he made a pain in the neck bearable. Jill Hennessy, however, at least for me, never having seen her previously, has no such aura. She comes through as a woman immature to a high degree.  Let me clarify that, she appears to be an excellent actress whose clear humanity, mostly in her relationship to the always superior Ken Howard, never counterbalances the sheer self-obsessed egotism of the role written for her. Perhaps my own experience within organizations has made me impervious to the virtues of people who screw up everything they touch because it is always them involved not the needs of the organization, their way, their desires, and never mind the trouble they cause everyone else. With the rest of the roles in the show, I am sympathetic and willing to take the bitter with the better (Goodman Ace). The shows are built around the customarily brilliant rebel finding quick solutions, with the help of her Dad, the retired police officer. The sequence of problem raised to problem solved is no worse and no better than the many such exhibitions we have had over the years.

The fact that it takes place in a morgue is not depressing because the story and the characters are so interesting.  All of the Actors are great. This first Season featured Jordan talking to her Father and speculating on how crimes were committed as he was a retired Police man who ran a bar.  I don't know what happened with NBC because the last show of the seasons did not match up to the beginning of the next season.  A lot of questions were never answered during the whole series. Nevertheless, each season was great. NBC made a mistake in cancelling this show.  Jay Leno could not compete with it.  It was surely one of the best shows on TV ever, and we are waiting for more DVDs of the ensuing seasons.",5,My Favorite TV program,1265068800,"02 2, 2010",2010,766,"['CROSSING', 'JORDAN', 'favorite', 'Television', 'Program', 'ever', 'fact', 'place', 'morgue', 'not', 'depressing', 'story', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'interesting', 'Actors', 'are', 'great', 'first', 'Season', 'featured', 'Jordan', 'talking', 'Father', 'speculating', 'how', 'crimes', 'were', 'committed', 'was', 'retired', 'Police', 'man', 'who', 'ran', 'bar', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'NBC', 'last', 'show', 'seasons', 'did', 'not', 'match', 'up', 'beginning', 'next', 'season', 'lot', 'questions', 'were', 'never', 'answered', 'whole', 'series', 'Nevertheless', 'season', 'was', 'great', 'NBC', 'made', 'mistake', 'cancelling', 'show', 'Jay', 'Leno', 'could', 'not', 'compete', 'was', 'surely', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'TV', 'ever', 'are', 'waiting', 'more', 'DVDs', 'ensuing', 'seasons']",Crossing Jordan: Season 1

1141525,A1C1U3RRUZ138Z,B0013DZNAA,"L7 ""Tech Head""","[6, 6]","Wonderful, heartfelt show, with a great continuing mystery. Unlike some of the Law and Order shows, Crossing Jordan has more of an emotional investment in the characters on the show. You really get caught up in the story, along with the drama of the crime. I started watching it again, after the few yrs it was off the air. Love Jordan, and the characters.But if you are like me you watch full seasons of shows on Netflix, but sometimes the story arc gets confused. Well with CJ, it's a mess. NBC aired the episodes in the wrong order, so the story makes no sense. If you try and find the episode guide online, it still is in bad shape. I have corrected the order in which the episodes were suppose to air. Follow the names of the episodes and the production numbers, NOT the episode numbers.OriginalEpisode #  Prod #  Air Date  Titles_____ ______ ___________  ___________ ___________________________________________* Season 11-01  64301  24/Sep/01  Pilot1-02  64302  01/Oct/01  The Dawn of a New Day1-03  64303  08/Oct/01  The Ties That Bind1-05  64304  22/Oct/01  You Can't Go Home1-04  64305  15/Oct/01  Born to RunAgain1-06  64306  29/Oct/01  Believers1-07  64307  12/Nov/01  Sight Unseen1-08  64308  19/Nov/01  Digger (1)1-09  64309  26/Nov/01  Digger (2)1-10  64310  10/Dec/01  Blue Christmas1-11  64311  07/Jan/02  Wrong Place, Wrong Time1-12  64312  14/Jan/02  Blood Relatives1-13  64313  21/Jan/02  Miracles & Wonders1-14  64314  28/Jan/02  Four Fathers1-15  64315  04/Feb/02  Acts of Mercy1-16  64316  25/Feb/02  Lost and Found1-17  64317  04/Mar/02  Crime & Punishment1-18  64318  18/Mar/02  With Honor1-19  64319  08/Apr/02  For Harry, with Love and Squalor1-20  64320  15/Apr/02  The Gift of Life1-21  64321  29/Apr/02  Someone to Count On1-22  64322  06/May/02  Secrets & Lies (1)1-23  64323  13/May/02  Secrets & Lies (2)* Season 22-01  02001  23/Sep/02  There's No Place Like Home2-02  02002  30/Sep/02  Bombs Away2-03  02003  07/Oct/02  The Truth Is Out There2-04  02004  14/Oct/02  Payback2-05  02005  21/Oct/02  As If by Fate2-07  02006  18/Nov/02  Scared Straight2-06  02007  11/Nov/02  One Twelve2-08  02008  02/Dec/02  Don't Look Back2-15  02009  24/Feb/03  John Doe2-09  02010  09/Dec/02  Prisoner Exchange2-10  02011  06/Jan/03  Ockham's Razor2-11  02012  13/Jan/03  Family Ties2-12  02013  27/Jan/03  Perfect Storm2-14  02014  10/Feb/03  Wild Card2-13  02015  03/Feb/03  Strangled2-16  02016  17/Mar/03  Conspiracy2-20  02017  21/Apr/03  Sunset Division2-17  02018  31/Mar/03  Cruel and Unusual2-18  02019  07/Apr/03  Fire and Ice2-19  02020  14/Apr/03  Dead Wives Club2-21  02021  28/Apr/03  Pandora's Trunk (1)2-22  02022  05/May/03  Pandora's Trunk (2)* Season 33-13  03001  06/Jun/04  Oh, Brother Where Art Thou?

The very fine Miguel Ferrer was given a chance to prove his worth; I don't think his immense talent has been put to such good use as here. I look forward to watching these episodes again, and hope the other seasons will be available soon. It was a fun ride. Jordan Cavanaugh is not to be written off as just another detective-type.
