True fans will save their money for the complete series on DVD.  Well, we have Blackadder, now where is Mr. Bean and &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot; on DVD?  Bean is completely opposite of Blackadder and Thin Blue Line in that as Bean, Rowan is all but mute and completely relies on physical comedy, where as in Blackadder (as Edmund) and Thin Blue line (as Inspector Fowler) Rowan talks his head off and the main source of comedy is in the dialogue, although physical comedy is not absent by any means.  Those who only know Rowan for being Bean may be shocked when they see Blackadder or Blue line for the first time because of the drastic character change, but trust me he's just as funny with words as he is with physical action.  &quot;The Best Bits of Mr. Bean&quot; is fine for a rental or for an extremely casual fan, but bigger fans of Rowan and Bean are still waiting for the complete series on DVD.  I can highly recommend the Blackadder 5 disc DVD set, which contains all 4 series (24 episodes), a reunion special, and other goodies (read my review of that item for much more detail) but I recommend saving your money for the complete &quot;Mr. Bean&quot; series.

448818,A1N2E1GTHUSG7P,6305112851,Ryoko's Husband,"[0, 0]","Greetings;Nothing new mind you, Rowan Atkinson felt that he was being typecasted with acting in parts much like Bean. But he had a good run, several movies, several seasons in BBC terms as well as the animated series and a Wii video game based on the animated episodes. The physical aspects that would often go into his playing the part was probably also getting to be a bit too much, especially when expected to act like a child. But enough about that.Been a big fan since I was much much younger. Used to have a couple of the episodes on VHS, the movie, the best bits of bean-which is what this review is really about mind you-as well as several tapes to the Thin Blue Line show which when I was much much younger, I couldn't understand what they had to do with Mr. Bean-which is to say they have nothing to do with each other, just a few actors here and there. I upgraded to dvd over the years and for some time had the 'complete' series which included the tv show and nothing else. I also bought the best of Mr. Bean Vol. 1 which I thought was what this was supposed to be but in fact, it isn't. My main point in all this is that while the Best bits of Mr. Bean is a flashback episode as many have been quick to point out, it is still an episode. I don't care for the snippets so much since there is a lot left out of some of them-the crushed car scene-he falls to his knees and the scene ends, as though he were more upset by the whole thing but the scene would contine in the show to reveal him pulling the deadbolt off his driver side door and acting as though everything were fine. Makes the scene more dramatic but still. I wanted it for the element that strung it all together. Him digging around his attic as it gives you even more of a glimpse into his flat. How he lives not that much else is revealed but still-all of the other things he has stored away in there, so many other unaddressed stories.They did return to the attic a bit in the animated series but still. Just fun to see something more of Bean. Even if some of his bits are things he had done before apart from bean, elements from his stand-up and sketches. But it is all in good fun. Oh, but do see his one man show.
