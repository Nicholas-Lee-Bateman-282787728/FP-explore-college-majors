1151567,A4R9MJFF8UFND,B0015YX412,Brian Camp,"[27, 29]","THE FANTASTIC ADVENTURES OF UNICO (1981) was based on a manga (comic book) by Osamu Tezuka (""Astro Boy"") and, according to some sources, co-directed by Tezuka himself. It was produced by Sanrio, home of Hello Kitty (who makes a cameo appearance), and it tells the tale of Unico, a cute little unicorn whose horn has magical powers and allows him to bring happiness to everyone he comes into contact with. When the gods get angry at Unico for having such powers they order the West Wind to exile him. Against orders, the West Wind drops him off at the Island of the Devil of Solitude, where he encounters the cranky and mischievous little blue devil, Beezel, sole occupant of the island. Not much later, just after Unico's finally convinced Beezel to be his friend, The West Wind comes by to whisk Unico away again, and drops him in another land, where he befriends a selfish little kitten named Katy and even turns her into a human girl to fulfill her most devout wish, but only if she'll continue to help the old woman in whose house they stay.For the first half of the film, it's traditional children's film territory as Unico befriends two disparate and flawed creatures and seeks to get the anti-social Beezel and the vain, self-absorbed Katy to learn how to care about other people. The theme of redeeming the worst among us is a common one in Tezuka's works. But then things take a dark turn in the second half as a local Baron, handsome, long-haired and devious, takes an interest in Katy and lures her to his castle, where he plies her with wine, even drugging her and putting her to bed, for what sinister purpose we never find out. There's even a scene where some cuddly forest creatures, turned evil by the Baron's magic, attack a monkey. The Baron suffers a gruesome, violent fate during his battle with Unico, but he then reveals his gargantuan demon form, which cuts a swath of great destruction through his castle and the surrounding forest, culminating in a raging fire. All of this would make the film of greater interest to older kids, say 8-to-10, while possibly scaring the 4-to-5-year-olds.It's a tricky film to recommend to a particular age group. There's not enough dramatic interest for a teenage or adult audience except, perhaps, for the scenes of Katy in the Baron's castle. The first half is better suited for young children (4-7), while older ones would prefer the second half with its action and spectacle. Parents have to judge how well their children can take scary, monstrous material. It does get pretty exciting, though, so my guess is that most kids would eagerly stick with it. And it does have a set of positive messages.It's very nicely animated and designed, with beautiful shots of lush, natural countrysides bedecked with flowers. It's always nice to look at, even in the parts that would try adult viewers' patience. It's done in a more neutral animation style than we usually see in Japanese animated films, one that's closer to American cartoons, with only a few trademark touches giving it away as Japanese, such as that sinister long-haired Baron, in his 18th-century outfits and baroque castle, and the resemblance of Unico to Tezuka's other great little white animated wild creature, Kimba, the White Lion.The disc comes only with an English dub, which is too bad, since the English voices, particularly that of Beezel, are especially grating to older viewers' ears. There are also a couple of insipid English-language songs which I assume were newly recorded for the English dub and made me wish I could hear the original Japanese soundtrack. There have been other Unico films, including a direct sequel to this one, entitled UNICO IN THE ISLAND OF MAGIC (1983).",3,Unusual children's animated feature from Japan,1230854400,"01 2, 2009",2009,3712,"['FANTASTIC', 'ADVENTURES', 'OF', 'UNICO', '1981', 'was', 'based', 'manga', 'comic', 'book', 'Osamu', 'Tezuka', 'Astro', 'Boy', 'according', 'sources', 'co-directed', 'Tezuka', 'was', 'produced', 'Sanrio', 'home', 'Hello', 'Kitty', 'who', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'tale', 'Unico', 'cute', 'little', 'unicorn', 'horn', 'magical', 'powers', 'bring', 'happiness', 'everyone', 'contact', 'When', 'gods', 'get', 'angry', 'Unico', 'having', 'such', 'powers', 'order', 'West', 'Wind', 'exile', 'Against', 'orders', 'West', 'Wind', 'off', 'Island', 'Devil', 'Solitude', 'where', 'cranky', 'mischievous', 'little', 'blue', 'devil', 'Beezel', 'sole', 'occupant', 'island', 'Not', 'much', 'later', 'just', 'Unico', 'finally', 'convinced', 'Beezel', 'be', 'friend', 'West', 'Wind', 'whisk', 'Unico', 'away', 'again', 'land', 'where', 'selfish', 'little', 'kitten', 'named', 'Katy', 'even', 'human', 'girl', 'fulfill', 'most', 'devout', 'wish', 'only', ""'ll"", 'continue', 'help', 'old', 'woman', 'house', 'stay.For', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'traditional', 'children', 'film', 'territory', 'Unico', 'two', 'disparate', 'flawed', 'creatures', 'get', 'anti-social', 'Beezel', 'vain', 'self-absorbed', 'Katy', 'learn', 'how', 'care', 'other', 'people', 'theme', 'redeeming', 'worst', 'common', 'one', 'Tezuka', 'works', 'then', 'things', 'take', 'dark', 'turn', 'second', 'half', 'local', 'Baron', 'handsome', 'long-haired', 'devious', 'interest', 'Katy', 'castle', 'where', 'wine', 'even', 'drugging', 'putting', 'bed', 'what', 'sinister', 'purpose', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'even', 'scene', 'where', 'cuddly', 'forest', 'creatures', 'turned', 'evil', 'Baron', 'magic', 'attack', 'monkey', 'Baron', 'gruesome', 'violent', 'fate', 'battle', 'Unico', 'then', 'gargantuan', 'demon', 'form', 'swath', 'great', 'destruction', 'castle', 'surrounding', 'forest', 'culminating', 'raging', 'fire', 'would', 'make', 'film', 'greater', 'interest', 'older', 'kids', 'say', '8-to-10', 'possibly', 'scaring', '4-to-5-year-olds.It', 'tricky', 'film', 'recommend', 'particular', 'age', 'group', 'not', 'enough', 'dramatic', 'interest', 'teenage', 'adult', 'audience', 'perhaps', 'scenes', 'Katy', 'Baron', 'castle', 'first', 'half', 'better', 'suited', 'young', 'children', '4-7', 'older', 'ones', 'would', 'prefer', 'second', 'half', 'action', 'spectacle', 'Parents', 'have', 'judge', 'how', 'well', 'children', 'can', 'take', 'scary', 'monstrous', 'material', 'get', 'pretty', 'exciting', 'though', 'guess', 'most', 'kids', 'would', 'eagerly', 'stick', 'have', 'set', 'positive', 'messages.It', 'very', 'nicely', 'animated', 'designed', 'beautiful', 'shots', 'lush', 'natural', 'countrysides', 'bedecked', 'flowers', 'always', 'nice', 'look', 'even', 'parts', 'would', 'try', 'adult', 'viewers', 'patience', 'done', 'more', 'neutral', 'animation', 'style', 'usually', 'see', 'Japanese', 'animated', 'films', 'one', 'closer', 'American', 'cartoons', 'only', 'few', 'trademark', 'touches', 'giving', 'away', 'Japanese', 'such', 'sinister', 'long-haired', 'Baron', '18th-century', 'outfits', 'baroque', 'castle', 'resemblance', 'Unico', 'Tezuka', 'other', 'great', 'little', 'white', 'animated', 'wild', 'creature', 'Kimba', 'White', 'Lion.The', 'disc', 'only', 'English', 'dub', 'too', 'bad', 'English', 'voices', 'particularly', 'Beezel', 'are', 'especially', 'grating', 'older', 'viewers', 'ears', 'are', 'also', 'couple', 'insipid', 'English-language', 'songs', 'assume', 'were', 'newly', 'recorded', 'English', 'dub', 'made', 'wish', 'could', 'hear', 'original', 'Japanese', 'soundtrack', 'have', 'been', 'other', 'Unico', 'films', 'including', 'direct', 'sequel', 'one', 'entitled', 'UNICO', 'IN', 'THE', 'ISLAND', 'OF', 'MAGIC', '1983']",N/A
