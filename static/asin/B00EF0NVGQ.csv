The detail and intricacy of any design-with-fabric business is both time consuming and very fulfilling.  This movie took me back into the world of fabrics and designs.  The clothing worn by both lead actresses was stunning.  When they showed their seasonal lines to their clients, I could not take my eyes off the fashions.  I can see why this series won awards for fashion design.  Fashions during the 1920's had a lot of bead work, usually done by hand.  You don't see that work any longer and it was a joy to behold during this series.I also loved the language.  It was so nice to not hear slang and harsh words like we hear on our TV today.  Yes, people got angry and upset, but their vocal expressions were so much more palatable then what you see today.  My last comment is that this series is primarily for women.  I fully intend to watch it for many, many years to come.",5,Absolutely and Completely Fabulous,1399248000,"05 5, 2014",2014,1089,"['have', 'designed', 'clothing', 'years', 'also', 'owned', 'window', 'covering', 'business', 'where', 'spent', 'endless', 'hours', 'drapery', 'workrooms', 'working', 'seamstresses', 'order', 'come', 'up', 'beautiful', 'finished', 'product', 'detail', 'intricacy', 'design-with-fabric', 'business', 'time', 'consuming', 'very', 'fulfilling', 'movie', 'took', 'back', 'world', 'fabrics', 'designs', 'clothing', 'worn', 'lead', 'actresses', 'was', 'stunning', 'When', 'showed', 'seasonal', 'lines', 'clients', 'could', 'not', 'take', 'eyes', 'fashions', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'series', 'won', 'awards', 'fashion', 'design', 'Fashions', '1920', 'had', 'lot', 'bead', 'work', 'usually', 'done', 'hand', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'work', 'longer', 'was', 'joy', 'behold', 'series.I', 'also', 'loved', 'language', 'was', 'so', 'nice', 'not', 'hear', 'slang', 'harsh', 'words', 'hear', 'TV', 'today', 'Yes', 'people', 'got', 'angry', 'upset', 'vocal', 'expressions', 'were', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'palatable', 'then', 'what', 'see', 'today', 'last', 'comment', 'series', 'primarily', 'women', 'fully', 'intend', 'watch', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'come']",N/A

1667096,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B00EF0NVGQ,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[26, 26]","Stellar in flapper costume elegance. The main plot of the 3 year series is two sisters bucking the system and beginning a lifetime of high society women's fashion. A 1920s rags to riches adventure (which alas did end suddenly like the stock market of the time.) Why did BBC every cancel?The good news, it's back in this new packaging andSUBTITLES,yes, SDH SUBTITLES are NOW included.The sets and props are as period perfect and breathtaking as the gowns the sisters create. And it is an advantage to have two beautiful lead roles played by Stella Gonet (Holby City) and Louise Lombard (CSI) to fill the sisters' act.Episode plots keep the romance and action perking right along. There is never a dull moment in the 34 episodes. It's almost 30 hours of viewing London from the high society, low-brow, in-shop, street, and dark sides of clothing marketing as well as love lives both working and gone awry. The only negative I can offer is the fact that this Emmy and BAFTA award-winning series came to an end long before the public was ready. Again, Why?The series was created from the lady team that also was responsible for ""Upstairs, Downstairs""--Jean Marsh and Eileen Atkins, stars in their own right in front of the camera.Because this series is PERIOD COSTUME DRAMA, it never seems dated. It's stuck in the 1920s, and marvelously so.This is a series must for British period lovers, and who isn't these days. I keep my set on the shelf, HANDY-LIKE, right beside my personal copy series of Downton Abbey.
