Wayne Wang is one of the most famous directors of &quot;no budget films&quot; (films that shoot on 16mm and video with no connection to Hollywood) and popularized by Rick Schmidt.  On that recommendation, I went to see this movie.The plot centers around a rich tech-geek who hires a stripper to go with him to Las Vegas.  During the trip, sex mixes with (maybe) love and eventually all hell breaks lose with each side realizing what they really are.There are plenty of reasons to view this movie.  The characters are very complex, with truly subtle perfomances given by all involved.  The story also is engaging with enough twists to keep one puzzled.  This is a sexual film that is the complete opposite of &quot;Showgirls.&quot;  It is a view of the sex industry with both it's appeal and its horrible toll of the minds of its partisipants.  You will real want to discuss this film.So far, it sounds like a five star movie, but it isn't.  The lowbudgetness of the movie makes the sex scenes look like porn, which actually draws the audiance out of the emotions Wang is looking for.  It also is a movie that becomes increasingly vulgar to melodramatic effect, so as to almost parody itself at times.It appears that there were two sides to Director Wayne Wang on this piece.Director Wayne made a profound study of the sex industry.Director WANG made a cheap vulgar porno.It's too bad that they're the same movie.",3,Weird Sexual Film Leaves One Dry,1008288000,"12 14, 2001",2001,1437,"['was', 'weird', 'movie', 'Wayne', 'Wang', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'directors', 'quot', 'budget', 'films', 'quot', 'films', 'shoot', '16mm', 'video', 'connection', 'Hollywood', 'popularized', 'Rick', 'Schmidt', 'recommendation', 'went', 'see', 'movie.The', 'plot', 'centers', 'rich', 'tech-geek', 'who', 'stripper', 'go', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'trip', 'sex', 'mixes', 'maybe', 'love', 'eventually', 'hell', 'breaks', 'lose', 'side', 'realizing', 'what', 'really', 'are', 'plenty', 'reasons', 'view', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'complex', 'truly', 'subtle', 'perfomances', 'given', 'involved', 'story', 'also', 'engaging', 'enough', 'twists', 'keep', 'one', 'puzzled', 'sexual', 'film', 'complete', 'opposite', 'quot', 'Showgirls.', 'quot', 'view', 'sex', 'industry', 'appeal', 'horrible', 'toll', 'minds', 'partisipants', 'will', 'real', 'want', 'discuss', 'film.So', 'far', 'five', 'star', 'movie', ""n't"", 'lowbudgetness', 'movie', 'sex', 'scenes', 'look', 'porn', 'actually', 'audiance', 'emotions', 'Wang', 'looking', 'also', 'movie', 'increasingly', 'vulgar', 'melodramatic', 'effect', 'so', 'almost', 'parody', 'times.It', 'were', 'two', 'sides', 'Director', 'Wayne', 'Wang', 'piece.Director', 'Wayne', 'made', 'profound', 'study', 'sex', 'industry.Director', 'WANG', 'made', 'cheap', 'vulgar', 'porno.It', 'too', 'bad', ""'re"", 'same', 'movie']",The Center of the World

[H]e plays the  main character, not Balthazar Getty, who is barely in the film but is listed on top of the credits. I thought Sarsgaard was so great that I went over to IMDB to look up his other film credits.  Much to my surprise, he apparently played a super bad guy in ""Boys Don't Cry.""  I didn't even recognize him from that film to this film and that is the hallmark of great acting ability.  He reminds me a great deal of Colin Firth, from a decade ago, as a leading man except that he's American. I picked the film because I generally admire Wayne Wang's work and have followed his career from its start with ""Dim Sum.""  Wang has moved away from using solely Japanese American characters but has not moved away from his independent, edgy roots.  I don't think this is a porn film, by the way, as others do. I think it is an American romance through and through.  Sarsgaard is a wealthy cyber geek who is not a bad guy but his long suite is not the social graces.  Shane Edelman plays the woman who comes into his life.  She plays in a rock and roll band and also strips to support herself until she ""makes it"" as a drummer.  This is actually about as American as you can get and is a far cry from the woman waiting for a man to rescue her from a life of stripping cliche.  These two really match up quite well because they have a lot in common and in many ways are similar souls.  It may not look that way on the surface but this is a deeply layered work and much becomes apparent to the patient viewer.  Shane Edelman also does a nice job of showing how a ""regular"" woman can range all over the place in both her appearance and her emotions.  Personally, I don't see how you can go wrong with this one.",5,Going Out On A Limb: I Thought It Was Great!,1022284800,"05 25, 2002",2002,1756,"['[', 'agree', ']', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'WONDERFUL', '[', 'H', ']', 'e', 'main', 'character', 'not', 'Balthazar', 'Getty', 'who', 'barely', 'film', 'listed', 'top', 'credits', 'thought', 'Sarsgaard', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'went', 'IMDB', 'look', 'up', 'other', 'film', 'credits', 'Much', 'surprise', 'apparently', 'played', 'super', 'bad', 'guy', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'recognize', 'film', 'film', 'hallmark', 'great', 'acting', 'ability', 'great', 'deal', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'decade', 'ago', 'leading', 'man', 'American', 'picked', 'film', 'generally', 'admire', 'Wayne', 'Wang', 'work', 'have', 'followed', 'career', 'start', 'Dim', 'Sum', 'Wang', 'moved', 'away', 'using', 'solely', 'Japanese', 'American', 'characters', 'not', 'moved', 'away', 'independent', 'edgy', 'roots', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'porn', 'film', 'way', 'others', 'do', 'think', 'American', 'romance', 'Sarsgaard', 'wealthy', 'cyber', 'geek', 'who', 'not', 'bad', 'guy', 'long', 'suite', 'not', 'social', 'graces', 'Shane', 'Edelman', 'woman', 'who', 'life', 'rock', 'roll', 'band', 'also', 'support', 'drummer', 'actually', 'about', 'as', 'American', 'can', 'get', 'far', 'cry', 'woman', 'waiting', 'man', 'rescue', 'life', 'stripping', 'cliche', 'two', 'really', 'match', 'up', 'quite', 'well', 'have', 'lot', 'common', 'many', 'ways', 'are', 'similar', 'souls', 'may', 'not', 'look', 'way', 'surface', 'deeply', 'layered', 'work', 'much', 'becomes', 'apparent', 'patient', 'viewer', 'Shane', 'Edelman', 'also', 'nice', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'regular', 'woman', 'can', 'range', 'place', 'appearance', 'emotions', 'Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'one']",The Center of the World
664320,A27CFNHYZG6WS8,B00005LPZW,darragh o'donoghue,"[7, 11]","In outline, 'Center of the World' is one of those envelope-pushing, censor-baiting films like 'Intimacy' that combines the use of digital film-making and the subject matter of explicit sex to create a more immediate and frank picture of reality, or realism.  this being a film by Wayne Wang and co-written by Paul Auster, we can at least expect some intelligence in this case, and 'Center' is less interested in presenting unadorned reality, than exploring the links between digital film-making and sexuality.  The artificial premise - a dot.com millionaire takes a lap-dancer to Las Vegas for a 'romantic' weekend - is heightened by the artificial flashback structure; the strict rules laid down by the woman; the theatrical rituals in which we see every stage in the process of making the erotic illusion, the make-up, clothes, music, body movement, dialogue etc.; the theatrical surroundings, the complex framing of the hotel rooms, with their fairy-tale-like doorways restricting passage, and paintings of nude figures; the phoniness of Las Vegas itself, less the centre of the world than a gaudy, miniature recreation of it.  This emphasis on the artifice of sex, supposedly the most natural relation between two people, its rules, games, strategies, rituals etc., is much more convincing than the contrived realism of 'Intimacy''s grappling.Allied to this artifice of subject matter is Wang's film-making.  Taking his digital camera which facilitates greater realism, and setting it in Las Vegas, makes the real even more artificial, the outlines of bodies and surfaces heightened, as if against a backdrop, the characters removed from their surroundings.  Wang makes great play with reflections (mirrors, windows, glass) to elucidate his main theme, the conflict between reality and illusion, between genuine emotion and an act, that pivots the story.  But he also makes us aware of the presence of the camera, its elaborate, artifical movements, the degrading and disintegration of the image, which become a thematic, even philosophical reflection on the human drama.  More importantly, Wang reveals the limitation of digital's claims on the real - in one brilliant scene, the camera is tied to a rollercoaster: the image can't keep up with the speed and breaks up, fails, just as Wang knows the representation of explicit sex can never go the whole way, which the child-like Richard learns devastatingly, forever uncomprehending that centre of the world, female sexuality.so the film is intelligent and sensitive.  there are, however, two big problems.  the first is that Molly Parker takes all the risks, her body is constantly on display, often filmed in ways flattering to the voyeur.  It could be argued, from the opening credits of a computer screen, the hero's centre of the world, that the entire story is the fantasy of a nerd (the ambiguity of the flashbacks further question the narrative 'reality'), that everything must be mediated through his no-risk, no-show eyes.  but whatever way you argue it, it's always the woman taking her clothes off.  Secondly, and more damagingly, these films like 'Intimacy' are supposed to be 'about' sex, but they have no faith in the audience's interest and have to impose stories around it, wending towards utterly predictable climaxes or releases, which is why 'In the Realm of the Senses', a film unflinching and uncluttered in its representation of sex, remains unequalled.  So 'Centre', for all its ambition and frequent, ironic wit, ends up becoming rather dull.",2,Virtually interesting.,1004918400,"11 5, 2001",2001,3522,"['outline', ""'Center"", 'World', 'one', 'envelope-pushing', 'censor-baiting', 'films', ""'Intimacy"", 'use', 'digital', 'film-making', 'subject', 'matter', 'explicit', 'sex', 'create', 'more', 'immediate', 'frank', 'picture', 'reality', 'realism', 'being', 'film', 'Wayne', 'Wang', 'co-written', 'Paul', 'Auster', 'can', 'least', 'expect', 'intelligence', 'case', ""'Center"", 'less', 'interested', 'presenting', 'unadorned', 'reality', 'exploring', 'links', 'digital', 'film-making', 'sexuality', 'artificial', 'premise', 'dot.com', 'millionaire', 'lap-dancer', 'Las', 'Vegas', ""'romantic"", 'weekend', 'heightened', 'artificial', 'flashback', 'structure', 'strict', 'rules', 'laid', 'down', 'woman', 'theatrical', 'rituals', 'see', 'stage', 'process', 'making', 'erotic', 'illusion', 'make-up', 'clothes', 'music', 'body', 'movement', 'dialogue', 'etc', 'theatrical', 'surroundings', 'complex', 'framing', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'fairy-tale-like', 'doorways', 'restricting', 'passage', 'paintings', 'nude', 'figures', 'phoniness', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'less', 'centre', 'world', 'gaudy', 'miniature', 'recreation', 'emphasis', 'artifice', 'sex', 'supposedly', 'most', 'natural', 'relation', 'two', 'people', 'rules', 'games', 'strategies', 'rituals', 'etc.', 'much', 'more', 'convincing', 'contrived', 'realism', ""'Intimacy"", 's', 'grappling.Allied', 'artifice', 'subject', 'matter', 'Wang', 'film-making', 'Taking', 'digital', 'camera', 'greater', 'realism', 'setting', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'real', 'even', 'more', 'artificial', 'outlines', 'bodies', 'surfaces', 'heightened', 'backdrop', 'characters', 'removed', 'surroundings', 'Wang', 'great', 'play', 'reflections', 'mirrors', 'windows', 'glass', 'elucidate', 'main', 'theme', 'conflict', 'reality', 'illusion', 'genuine', 'emotion', 'act', 'story', 'also', 'aware', 'presence', 'camera', 'elaborate', 'artifical', 'movements', 'degrading', 'disintegration', 'image', 'become', 'thematic', 'even', 'philosophical', 'reflection', 'human', 'drama', 'More', 'importantly', 'Wang', 'limitation', 'digital', 'claims', 'real', 'one', 'brilliant', 'scene', 'camera', 'tied', 'rollercoaster', 'image', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'speed', 'breaks', 'up', 'fails', 'just', 'Wang', 'representation', 'explicit', 'sex', 'can', 'never', 'go', 'whole', 'way', 'child-like', 'Richard', 'devastatingly', 'forever', 'uncomprehending', 'centre', 'world', 'female', 'sexuality.so', 'film', 'intelligent', 'sensitive', 'are', 'however', 'two', 'big', 'problems', 'first', 'Molly', 'Parker', 'risks', 'body', 'constantly', 'display', 'often', 'filmed', 'ways', 'flattering', 'voyeur', 'could', 'be', 'argued', 'opening', 'credits', 'computer', 'screen', 'hero', 'centre', 'world', 'entire', 'story', 'fantasy', 'nerd', 'ambiguity', 'flashbacks', 'further', 'question', 'narrative', ""'reality"", 'everything', 'must', 'be', 'mediated', 'no-risk', 'no-show', 'eyes', 'way', 'argue', 'always', 'woman', 'taking', 'clothes', 'off', 'Secondly', 'more', 'damagingly', 'films', ""'Intimacy"", 'are', 'supposed', 'be', ""'about"", 'sex', 'have', 'faith', 'audience', 'interest', 'have', 'impose', 'stories', 'wending', 'towards', 'utterly', 'predictable', 'climaxes', 'releases', 'why', 'Realm', 'Senses', 'film', 'unflinching', 'uncluttered', 'representation', 'sex', 'unequalled', 'So', ""'Centre"", 'ambition', 'frequent', 'ironic', 'wit', 'up', 'becoming', 'rather', 'dull']",The Center of the World

A gaudy hotel suite, complete with erotic paintings; a set of two double-doors, separating (permanently) our two protagonists.And behold the movie THE CENTER OF THE WORLD.  That's pretty much it.Okay, there is a little more than the above, but not much.  When computer wonder-boy Richard Longman (Peter Sarsgaard) finds himself infatuated with a stripper and rock drummer-wannabe Florence (Molly Parker), he offers the lady ten grand to spend three pleasurable nights in Las Vegas with him.  Never mind the fact he could have used the money for a decent set of clothes and a shampoo, but I digress.  Florence accepts the offer, but there are conditions.  Primarily, ala the film ""Pretty Woman,"" the conditions have to do with avoiding liking one another, so at once the viewer knows immediately what's going to happen.So, in essence, we are treated to a film where two characters prance and frolic in wanton self-denial, until, at last, one of them finally succumbs to his/her (no giving away the storyline for me, by golly) emotions.  The confrontation/climax is both bittersweet and unbelievable--especially once the rejector treats the rejectee to a most puzzling episode of self-pleasure, before the lowered eyes of said rejectee.Where the heck did that come from?But, again, I digress.  THE CENTER OF THE WORLD is a handsome film, and very easy on the eyes.  Both main characters could stand a square meal, by the way, but again, that's just me.  Eat hearty, folks.  The ending is contrived, nothing is actually resolved, and now I'm pulling the cushions off my sofa looking for loose change.

""The Center of the World"" was his first digital film, shot alternately on a Digi Betacam and Mini DV. Most critics didn't like it, but it is a rare film that deals with sex as frankly as this one, an unflinching exploration of the costs and consequences of sexual power. And this is a sexy film. There is a lot of sexual game-playing in it. My only complaint is that the Mini DV used in so many of the intimate scenes and close-ups brings out too much detail and makes the actors look sallow. This was before the days of HD DV, so the quality leaves something to be desired.Richard (Peter Sarsgaard) is a twenty-something technology entrepreneur whose hard work and dismal social life have made him co-owner of a company about to go public. He's going to be rich, and he'd like to enjoy himself. He is attracted to Florence (Molly Parker), a woman who frequents a local coffee shop. When he finds out that Florence is a stripper, Richard offers her $10,000 to spend three nights with him in Las Vegas, thinking this is an agreeable way to make his fantasies come true. Florence accepts, on the condition that there will be no intercourse. ""It's all an act. You know that, right?"" she says.Richard is used to being master of his own world, building a company and a fortune from behind a monitor and keyboard. Florence makes a living with her power to inspire men's imaginations and fulfill their fantasies while maintaining distance and control. Richard and Florence like each other, and their arrangement seems mutually beneficial. They have lively conversations about mundane things...until the power game becomes a power struggle. To what extent did Richard's fantasy become reality? Most women would not act as Florence does; strippers are very conscious of boundaries. But does her unwillingness to cede power undermine her own interests?

664338,A2H9UO8RYFX5MB,B00005LPZW,"Rich Stoehr ""Idle Rich""","[24, 26]","Think the premise of ""Pretty Woman,"" but more firmly grounded in the real world, and you might get close to what ""The Center of the World"" is all about. This film abandons the glamourized Hollywood notions of sex workers, and doesn't engage in the pat, happy ending that we saw in ""Pretty Woman""... and it is a far better film for it. Furthermore, Molly Parker is far more exotically lovely than Julia Roberts could even hope to be, and a better actress to boot.In short, if you're looking for a romantic escapist fantasy about a sex worker redeemed by the love of a good man, look elsewhere -- this film is far more complex than that.Comparisons to ""Pretty Woman"" do seem inevitable however, to the point that I wonder if the director and writers weren't crafting this film as a direct response to that one, a way of saying, ""Whoa boy, reality check!"" The premise is familiar at least. Richard (Peter Saarsgard) is wealthy but lonely after a breakup with his girlfriend two years before. He meets Florence (Molly Parker) in a coffee shop and finds out that she is a stripper. He visits her at the strip club where she works (nicely named Pandora's Box), and is so intrigued by her that he offers her $10,000 to spend three days with him in Las Vegas. She agrees, with a number of strict conditions, including limiting the number of hours she is required to ""work,"" and limiting the acts she will perform. ""No kissing on the mouth"" (sounds familiar, no?) and ""no penetration"" are among her limitations.From this familiar territory, though, the film explores new ground. Richard and Florence get to know one another as they spend more time together, and Florence finds out that Richard isn't such a bad guy, just lonely. ""Why do you have to be so nice?"" she asks him at one point, partially angry and partially not. Richard, in the meantime, is becoming more and more deeply entranced by this woman he has hired, which becomes part of the conflict.Given the subject of the film, there is of course a great deal of sexuality portrayed in it. It is handled pretty tastefully, and none of it is there for its own sake. It is partially through their sexual relationship that we see the growth and the limitations of the characters' relationship in general. The sex scenes are handsomely shot and are not the typical sort of scenes one might expect from an erotic film; nevertheless (perhaps because they are unique), they are extremely erotic.The acting is quite good. We spend most of the film only seeing Richard and Florence interacting together, with just a few other characters showing up here and there, but the two lead actors have the chops to sustain the film from beginning to end. Peter Saarsgard plays a ""nice guy"" well, and it's good to see that he doesn't overplay it at all. He's a very real nice guy, with flaws and points where he stops being nice out of frustration or anger. Molly Parker, as Florence, lends a similar depth to her role. From the first moment you see her you can see why Richard becomes infatuated with her: she is ethereally lovely, with a husky voice that is simply enthralling. But it is her personality that Richard really falls for, and that too is portrayed believably. She is played with a genuine warmth and likeability that is often missing from erotic films, but not overly sweet like ""Pretty Woman"" and many other Hollywood attempts at a similar story. I suspect that Molly Parker will be a talent to watch carefully in the next few years.The nature and limitations of the relationship between these two people -- in one sense employer and employee and in another far more intimate than that -- becomes the main subject of the film as it progresses. How much of what Florence is giving to Richard is real, and how much is an act? How does the aspect of money change what happens over that three days? Are his feelings based in reality?  Are hers?Some of these questions are answered at the end, others are left open to the viewer's interpretation. There is nothing about the end, however, that is trite or simple, and as in life, there is a great deal that will depend on the perspective of the person watching the story unfold. This is a film very much grounded in reality, dealing with real people in a realistic (if unique) situation, and in the end it avoids the typical Hollywood fantasy notions that are so common.Comparisons to ""Pretty Woman"" may well be inevitable for this film, but in such comparisons ""The Center of the World"" comes out ahead in every category.

It also explores the bleak terrain of emotional isolation. This time the protagonist is a rich internet geek (Peter Sarsgaard) who literally contracts with a rock and roll drummer and part-time stripper (Molly (Parker) for a sexual get-away in Las Vegas.  The phoniness of Vegas and the impersonal internet are more than metaphors for what amounts to virtual sex in real life.  The basic elements are familiar in countless other love stories, but here the physicality of the two main characters dominates everything.  In many ways we root for them to break out of their protective shells and actually connect with the hearts.Sometimes the walls we build to keep out the bad cuts us off from life itself. This film, shot on high definition video, evokes a more personal and immediate response and is much more effective on DVD than it is projected in a theater.

If you can watch this movie and come away without even knowing what the Center of the World is, then you just plain missed it.I guess if you're not in on the theme of the movie in your own life, you will indeed probably miss it. But since I hate to see a tremendously powerful message wasted by the hard knocks of those who can't understand, the fun is in discovering what the Center of the World is!I will give you a hint for you to look for in the movie. Hint: There are actually two versions of what the Center of the World is. The woman's, and the man's. What does the lady regard as the Center of the (her) world? Hmmm. And what does the gentleman regard as the Center of the world? It's that thing on his desk that allows him to be at the center of what is perhaps more appropriatley called his ""universe"".OK, so maybe if you're not into the information age, and you aren't at all interested in what the lady considers the Center of the World, then this movie might not appeal to you.

At issue is whether they can overcome their neurosis, their alienation from their own humanity. The answer is, no, it can't work, just as the woman (Florence) knows all along but the man (Richard) has to find out.We never learn what has caused their alienation but it's not important.  In the case of Richard, a successful computer geek, it is at least part of what has enabled him to immerse himself in work (some people believe that working long hours away from people have caused his neurosis but that is less likely).  In Florence' case it enables her to earn her living performing lap dances for strangers.  In both cases their coping mechanism is reinforced by its success.Florence is more aware of her coping mechanism and therefore  realistic about it.  Richard, suffering from over work, loneliness, the pressure of an impending IPO and the recent death of his father hasn't got a clue.  He meets Florence, learns that she is a stripper and invites her to a weekend in Vegas.  After being turned down he offers to pay for her company (!).  She is hip and knows nothing can come of this even after she later develops conflicting feelings.The ""exotic"" dancing is at least erotic, a lot more than I can say for the films, Exotica, Dancing at the Blue Iguana, Showgirls and Striptease.  That's probably because there was at least a psychological connection between the two characters.  I did feel sympathetic to them unlike anyone in those other films.

664344,A35S3VPS50CCX0,B00005LPZW,W.Kim,"[8, 8]","Arguably the most thematically serious film I've seen where a stripper was a lead character, director Wayne Wang's ""The Center of the World"" stars Richard (Peter Sarsgaard) as a software millionaire who offers $10,000 to Florence (Molly Parker - the widow in ""Deadwood""), a drummer in a struggling band who makes a living as a stripper) to spend three days with him in Las Vegas, setting the stage for a story about the collision between fantasy and reality: the fantasies upscale prostitutes sell to their clients and the weird mix of naivete, simple lust and a desire for connection that a john might bring to their relations - and the reality that these relations are little more than a transaction of the starkest sort.  Even more interesting for me was the balance Wang brings to the narrative: their changing points of view get almost equal time in the story, adding a bit more depth to the film than I expected.In an interview, director and co-writer Wang ("" Thousand Years of Good Prayers, Smoke, Joy Luck Club"") makes an interesting comment about how the film had it's genesis in a visit he made to the Silicon Valley area, where, at the time, there was a serious imbalance in the gender ratio of the areas' population, something akin to eight or more single men to every single woman.  And with all the ready money in the post dot.com-bust economy of the time, gave rise to a huge market for strippers, call girls and dating services.The film didn't have the strongest reception from the critics, which I thought was undeserved.  Wang and his co-writers, Paul Auster (""Smoke, Lulu on the Bridge"") Miranda July (""You Me & Everyone We Know"") did a great job getting into the characters heads and the performances of the leads is some of the best work I've seen from either actor.
