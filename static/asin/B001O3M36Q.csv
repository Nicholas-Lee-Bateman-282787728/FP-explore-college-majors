1221642,AY12DBB0U420B,B001O3M36Q,Gary Peterson,"[0, 1]","Here's a good bargain in amusing entertainment, if you like Tom Hanks. Actually, I've liked him a lot better in some of his more dramatic roles. The Hanks' comedies are amusing, to be sure, but I find them somewhat uncomfortable to watch because of the nature of the subject material. Take ""The 'Burbs,"" for example. All, I can say is, thank God I don't live on a suburban cul-d-sac like that of the movie. Everyone is into everyone else's face to a degree that I just couldn't tolerate. I goes well beyond funny and I cringed and felt uncomfortable in watching this so-called comedy unfold. In ""The Money Pit"" I again was cringing, but for different reasons. It's really tough to buy a house and represents a serious financial gamble, even if all goes well. It's just not a laughing matter. But in the ""Money Pit"" nothing went well. In fact it turned out to be a new homeowner's worst nightmare. Well, a lot of the things were visually amusing, to be sure, but I find it difficult to laugh at somebody else's very difficult problems, even if it's just a movie. In any case, those are just my personal feelings. The two movies are well done and the double feature packet is a good bargain, if you like those types of films. I thought ""The Money Pit"" was the better of the two movies.Gary Peterson",3,Amusing.

1221643,A7Y6AVS576M03,B001O3M36Q,gobirds2,"[1, 1]","In THE 'BURBS a little bit of life comes to a rather mundane suburban neighborhood thanks to director Joe Dante. Tom Hanks, Bruce Dern and others get obsessed with the strange goings on with their new neighbors (Henry Gibson and his strange looking family) that move in to their average American neighborhood. Gibson's relatives look like a barrel full of weirdoes to say the least. They were really a product of great casting. Corey Feldman is excellent as a teenage neighbor observer who sits on his porch and invites his friends over to watch the would-be commandos (Dern and Hanks) in action as they attempt to unravel and protect the neighborhood from Gibson's strange goings-on. Jerry Goldsmith composed a very good score that is in touch with his subject and keeps the pace of the film moving. His score also includes a very catchy end title for this bizarre little film. In fact Jerry Goldsmith's Dolby Digital 5.1 score is one of the best attractions on this DVD. I found this movie to be very amusing containing some real gut wrenching laughs along the way. Highly recommended viewing. THE MONEY PIT once again in the suburbs just somehow seems more annoying than entertaining. Yet, all the mayhem is somehow amusing to watch. Director Richard Benjamin's direction seems not be able to capture a real central point here. Joe Mantegna as Art Shirk is a standout.",5,Mayhem in the Suburbs,1381795200,"10 15, 2013",2013,1371,"['THE', ""'BURBS"", 'little', 'bit', 'life', 'rather', 'mundane', 'suburban', 'neighborhood', 'thanks', 'director', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'others', 'get', 'obsessed', 'strange', 'goings', 'new', 'neighbors', 'Henry', 'Gibson', 'strange', 'looking', 'family', 'move', 'average', 'American', 'neighborhood', 'Gibson', 'relatives', 'look', 'barrel', 'full', 'weirdoes', 'say', 'least', 'were', 'really', 'product', 'great', 'casting', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'excellent', 'teenage', 'neighbor', 'observer', 'who', 'porch', 'friends', 'watch', 'would-be', 'commandos', 'Dern', 'Hanks', 'action', 'attempt', 'unravel', 'protect', 'neighborhood', 'Gibson', 'strange', 'goings-on', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'composed', 'very', 'good', 'score', 'touch', 'subject', 'pace', 'film', 'moving', 'score', 'also', 'very', 'catchy', 'end', 'title', 'bizarre', 'little', 'film', 'fact', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'score', 'one', 'best', 'attractions', 'DVD', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'very', 'amusing', 'containing', 'real', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'laughs', 'way', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'viewing', 'MONEY', 'PIT', 'once', 'again', 'suburbs', 'just', 'somehow', 'more', 'annoying', 'entertaining', 'mayhem', 'somehow', 'amusing', 'watch', 'Director', 'Richard', 'Benjamin', 'direction', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'capture', 'real', 'central', 'point', 'here', 'Joe', 'Mantegna', 'Art', 'Shirk', 'standout']",The 'Burbs / The Money Pit Double Feature
