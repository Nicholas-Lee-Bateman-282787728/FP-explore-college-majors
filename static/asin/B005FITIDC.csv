This movie was adapted from a book about a real life situation going on in Africa and a man from America dedicating his life to helping the orphaned children there.Gerard plays Sam Childers, a heroin addicted ex con biker with an attitude, who after killing a man decides to change his ways and go to church.  He then turns it all around and opens his own business and starts his family.  He volunteers for a mission to Sudan and after staying there and seeing all the violence taking place there.  He decides to go back and try to open an orphanage there.  But as you watch the movie you will see all the hardships and torture this man goes through to help these kids.This movie is action packed and inspiring, it will make you cry as well.  It's simply amazing I don't understand why this movie hasn't gotten more recognition, I haven't heard anyone talking about it.  What makes this movie even more amazing is that this is actually taking place to this day, and they couldn't have found a better guy to play Sam than Gerard in my opinion.So I highly recommend this movie to anyone who isn't easily grossed out by blood and guts and can handle watching child deaths.

Shirley,"[14, 17]","I have seen Machine Gun Preacher, though it was not easy to do so in the US, due to the lousy PR efforts by Relativity Media (its head, Ryan Cavanaugh is allegedly a friend of Gerard's).  I recommend it, as it is probably Butler's best  performance to date.  He is an emotional guy, and it shows always, even in lackluster films like The Bounty Hunter.  Here, we see what he can do.  The film itself suffers from being too much story for one film but it is a fascinating take on a true story of a man who is willing to be a warrior missionary, not a peace loving missionary.He comes across as a violent man, a biker criminal who learns to take that violence and refocus it.  You get the impression here is a man, who, in his early life, would have smashed anyone in his way.  You do not have to agree with his approach as a missionary, but just understand that it was that or totally retreat from his work in the Sudan.

1458290,A1KQ6Z445AGKQL,B005FITIDC,Curtis A. Cecil,"[5, 7]","So tonight I watched a film that I had been really wanting to watch, but yet at the same time I was putting off seeing.Now I know that is an oxymoron but it is truth.  And it is a great depiction of this film as well.The movie was ""Machine Gun Preacher"" the story of Sam Childres.You can read multiple different reviews on this film.  It was very controversial since it was a story of FAITH but rated R and filled with violence.In the first 10 min's the film would turn any Christian watching it for Christian Values (Or at least make them blush).  From the on screen, yet not visible, sex in a car to extreme profanity, violence and alcohol and Drug abuse scenes... yet all these items are in context and are used to build the Character of the man.This man who was a biker gang member who upon getting out of jail finds his wife had gone `religious'.  Yet in a turn of events he realizes there has to be something more and in a non-dramatic scene we find him believing and being baptized.  There weren't angels, there weren't shouts from him but a sort of groggy sense of awe.We again see that same feeling when he arrives back from a trip to Northern Uganda to help with construction of a mission.  He, unlike the other members, wanted to see the truth of the war.  And did he ever...  His soon to be friend Deng took him to a village where the children would come each night in order to not be abducted.Finally he senses God's call to build an orphanage and a Church.  One in American and one in Sudan.  This is the story of the trials and floods that he goes against.  You will be pulled into the reality of this war that has been waged for 30+ years and that has taken the lives of over 400,000 people.  You will feel his anguish, his hurt, and his anger.There were two parts of this movie that moved me the most outside of the general message of Orphan care that you all know is my passion.First: When he is arriving back in the states after his monumental first trip.  You see on his face the unspoken emotion of one whose world has just been changed.  I have been there.  From my first visit to a squatters village in Mexico, or a small tribal village in Guatemala; but most vividly in the post earthquake Haiti where orphans begged for water on every street corner; where bodies are still being found among the ruble...  I understood this vague look of heartache.Second: we watch as Sam's story progress' and eventually we see what happens to most of us who become passionate about something.  We come up against opposition and we want to quit.  Sam didn't; but once he kept going he began to see others who didn't understand his passion, or share his passion as unworthy of being called Christians.  His passion became the only true passion of Christ instead of one means of showing God's passion.I would HIGHLY recommend this film to all of you who wish to learn more about what one man is doing in Sudan/Uganda.  I do not recommend it for those who are easily offended.  This Machine Gun Preacher lives up to his name not only with his gun but with his mouth.There is a quick note from the Real Sam at the end of the film in the credits that says in essence that I know that I may not have gone about this the best or right way at times... but  ""If a madmen abducted your child or a family member and I said I could bring them home, does it matter how I bring them home?""So to sum it all up: Don't watch it with the kids.  But don't watch it if you don't want your heart pulled out, trampled on cause you will finish asking yourself (I Hope) What on earth am I doing!!This movie is not about Sam Childers. It's about you.

Gerard Butler's portrayal and this story are somewhat beyond description. His acting is top notch and the story is as well.It shows how the real-life Sam Childers goes from a psychotic motorcycle thug to a tried and true freedom fighter for the children in southern Sudan and northern Uganda. It shows his transformation through his new found faith in the Christian religion and the unending support that he receives from his loving wife, daughter, and mother. He goes from robbing crack houses to building up his own successful construction company.He's then inspired by a missionary to go to Africa to ""help"". After his return, he's inspired to do more. He then builds his own church in order to support an orphanage in Sudan.In the beginning, everything goes really well until ... you know, it doesn't. Then his faith in everything that he believes in is tested. Part of his ""test"" comes when his best friend kills himself after Sam hurts him during a heated argument. Sam goes into a very emotionally dark place where you think that he might become the monster that he was and is now trying to fight in Africa. He's then reenergized by the love and support that he receives from his African friends and the children at the orphanage he runs.While watching this movie you'll go through every extreme of emotion from joy to dread. Just watching how this guy, by all rights should be dead of Anytown, Pennsylvania, fights for these kids that no one in the world cares about. It makes you wonder that if he can do this with minimal support, what the hell is the UN doing in Africa?This movie was truly inspiring and thought provoking.

1458298,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B005FITIDC,Eric Sanberg,"[17, 21]","This is one of the tougher movies I've ever tried to rate. It is entirely due to my difficulty in separating the story from the movie.Here's the scoop. Sam Childers is a bad guy. We meet him as he's getting out of prison. He's a junkie biker. He has no reservations about inflicting serious pain on people. He wants his wife, who has found Jesus and a respectable job, to go back to being a stripper. After a particularly rough bout with drugs he begins to re-examine his life. He goes straight. Finds a job. Builds a church. Starts a construction company. Goes to the Sudan to help out there and finds he genuinely cares about the lives of those people. He's now on a mission.This is certainly a great story. Here's a guy who's scraping the bottom of the barrel, turns himself around, and becomes a true, moving force in the lives of a tortured people. But I don't know if the movie itself is all that spectacular. The director, Mark Forster, has had some outstanding movies to his credit. He seemed to want to play this one straight, with little razzle dazzle. But it all seemed too familiar. I felt as though I'd seen most of these scenes before in other movies. There was too little here that was fresh. It was all very professional and tight. You could practically set your watch to it it was so evenly paced. Maybe that was the problem. It needed something to shake loose from the normal.This is by no means a bad movie and it's easy to watch. During the closing credits the viewer is treated to actual footage of Childers and others depicted in the movie. This is a serious plus. Some might take exception to the Jesus thumping, gun toting point of view, but that's how the story goes.

Plus a reminder of the ongoing atrocities the UN is doing nothng about. That's why it didn't last long in the theaters, I would guess.Childers is leading a pretty bad life when a traumatic incident makes him realize he has to change. He finds salvation in Christ, and things turn around. He is confronted with the sufferings inflicted by Kony and friends, and goes to the Sudan to do something to help, building an orphanage and feeding the victims.What do you do when helpless children are being kidnapped and turned into murdering monsters or killed? What do you do when these kidnapping cowards bring the fight to your gates, destroying their safe haven besides?Childers decides he has to fight back - using bullets and the occasional RPG. And this is what makes this movie interesting. What should he do? What should Christians do? Is ""turn the other cheek"" for when you're slapped, or also when other innocents are being slapped around?We see his frustration when fellow Christians back home seem indifferent to the horrors he has seen - at least, where their pocketbooks are concerned. He begins to focus on the Sudanese to the neglect of his family. Right or wrong? Is his daughter right to fret over Dad's refusal to spring for a limo for her formal when kids in the Sudan are getting hacked to death and blown up? We are not told if he shares these sufferings with his family; the movie portrays him as keeping it to himself.One reviewer mentions some scenes thrown in for dramatic effect, such as his crisis of faith, turning instead to himself to solve these problems.

Based on the tacky title, I expected &#34;Machine Gun Preacher&#34; to fall into that category; but actually, apart from the gore and fact that Butler's character is generally amoral and loathsome, it's a good movie.Butler is a junky drug dealer who, after nearly killing a man in a fit of rage, finds religion through the faith of his devoted wife.  Because he is fundamentally an obsessive person, he takes his new beliefs to an extreme, traveling to Africa to help dispossessed orphans.  He is deeply moved by the plight of these children, but an inherently violent man, it doesn't take long before he is militaristically embroiled in a veritable war in Africa.

I must be doing something right.""). Right then, I knew I had to check this out. Good move.You ever hear someone scoff at a Christian and say that God can't use them because of their past? Sam Childers could be a good example of that kind of thought, only he didn't use that thought. Getting out of jail for dealing drugs, the biker finds out his ex-stripper wife has accepted Christianity and, beinglike Lee Strobel before becoming a Christian, challenges that notion. But it takes a tripper after some drug use for him to reconsider. Reluctantly (VERY reluctantly, almost a la C.S. Lewis-esque) accepting Jesus, he decides to use a useful skill of his (construction) to build a new area for orphans. Then he goes north and hears about this ""Christian"" warlord, Joseph Kony, and decides to help the orphans even further. Only every time he tries to help, he gets attacked. More and more brutally every time. Over time (not sure how many years, but it goes from when his daughter's a young girl to being a high school student), he starts losing his mind. Losing his faith in God after his best friend dies a tragic death. Losing his family after his narrow-minded focus on the finances ""required"" for the orphans compared to our financial standards here. Losing his spiritual standing in his church. Essentially, losing everything that holds dear to him. Inevitably, though, he, like Job in the Bible, does get a few things back.Last Christian movie I saw that was this hardcore, raw, real, extreme, etc. was The Book of Eli, and for me, just as enjoyable.If not also as devastating.",5,How far is too far?,1339027200,"06 7, 2012",2012,1767,"['First', 'heard', 'was', 'Becoming', 'Archetype', 'website', 'controversial', 'movie', 'dealing', 'controversial', 'preacher', 'said', 'movie', 'got', 'price', 'head', 'must', 'be', 'doing', 'something', 'right.', 'Right', 'then', 'knew', 'had', 'check', 'out', 'Good', 'move.You', 'ever', 'hear', 'someone', 'scoff', 'Christian', 'say', 'God', 'ca', ""n't"", 'use', 'past', 'Sam', 'Childers', 'could', 'be', 'good', 'example', 'kind', 'thought', 'only', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'thought', 'Getting', 'jail', 'dealing', 'drugs', 'biker', 'out', 'ex-stripper', 'wife', 'accepted', 'Christianity', 'beinglike', 'Lee', 'Strobel', 'becoming', 'Christian', 'challenges', 'notion', 'tripper', 'drug', 'use', 'reconsider', 'Reluctantly', 'VERY', 'reluctantly', 'almost', 'la', 'C.S', 'Lewis-esque', 'accepting', 'Jesus', 'use', 'useful', 'skill', 'construction', 'build', 'new', 'area', 'orphans', 'Then', 'north', 'Christian', 'warlord', 'Joseph', 'Kony', 'help', 'orphans', 'even', 'further', 'Only', 'time', 'help', 'attacked', 'More', 'more', 'brutally', 'time', 'time', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'many', 'years', 'when', 'daughter', 'young', 'girl', 'being', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'losing', 'mind', 'Losing', 'faith', 'God', 'best', 'friend', 'tragic', 'death', 'Losing', 'family', 'narrow-minded', 'focus', 'finances', 'required', 'orphans', 'compared', 'financial', 'standards', 'here', 'Losing', 'spiritual', 'standing', 'church', 'Essentially', 'losing', 'everything', 'dear', 'Inevitably', 'though', 'Job', 'Bible', 'get', 'few', 'things', 'back.Last', 'Christian', 'movie', 'saw', 'was', 'hardcore', 'raw', 'real', 'extreme', 'etc', 'was', 'Book', 'Eli', 'just', 'enjoyable.If', 'not', 'also', 'devastating']",N/A
1458309,A10H47FMW8NHII,B005FITIDC,"Jay B. Lane ""professional audience member""","[14, 17]","This is a tough film to review because our ""Machine Gun Preacher"" was a violent person in the opening scenes. I know there are many moviegoers who would be inspired by this film but they will have to endure that first half hour. I guess you can't see what our hero has become until you see what he has been, so this R-rated film contains gunfire, disturbing images, drug use and lots of profanity.Real-life Sam Childers served as the consultant, which is a fictionalized account of his headstrong, passionate and unusual life. Childers was a biker, a felon, and a drug-dealing addict who became a Christian crusader dedicated to saving hundreds of children in the Sudan who, if they were lucky enough to survive, were handed AK 47s and forced to serve as soldiers. His mission to save children is no longer limited to one country. He has centers in several African countries, plus in the United States. (Google Sam Childers) I hasten to emphasize, Childers' endeavors are humanitarian, NOT religious. He says, ""You don't ask a hungry child who he worships.""These actors portray real people:*Gerard Butler (""Phantom of the Opera"") is Childers. Butler does a masterful job showing us the arc of Sam's early violent life followed by his conversion to Christ, and then his rage at the treatment of the children in the Sudan.*Michelle Monaghan (""Source Code"") plays his wife, a former stripper named Lynn, who, in my opinion, is truly Sam's anchor. Without Lynn's tough love and staunch support, his efforts would have collapsed long ago.*Kathy Baker (""Seven Days in Utopia"") is Daisy, the ever-lovin' Mama who swapped the gun in Sam's belt for a Bible....*Michael Shannon (""Revolutionary Road"") is Donnie, the ne'er-do-well brother who can't seem to get his bearings. This Oscar-nominated actor is so good it's spooky.Director Marc Forster (""The Kite Runner"") knows how to work with children so we know this inspiring story is in good hands. Script writer Jason Keller spent a year traveling with Childers and accumulating stories from his legendary life. This script compresses about 30 exciting years into a two-hour movie.It is obvious that not only is Sam passionate about his work, but scriptwriter Keller too, has become evangelistic about helping the innocent victims of this senseless slaughter.

His journey to save the children of Sudan from the LRA (Kony) is powerful and motivational.First, the story is very emotional and effective; it shows how Childers changed his life, through religion, for the better and if shows the atrocities that have occurred and continue to occur in Sudan. And, although religion is a significant part of the film, Machine Gun Preacher does not force religion on to the audience, which I think some viewers will appreciate. This is the type of film that can make you happy for a moment, and make you sad, or even cry, the next moment; for example, watching the kids play soccer with a baseball as Childers tried to teach them to play was heartwarming; conversely, watching a young boy chase after his dog and accidentally hit a explosive was heartwrenching. The film also works as an action film as it uses some intense action/shootout sequences to push the story along. Gerard Butler, as Childers, was brilliant. Michael Shannon, as Donnie, was also excellent, despite his limited screen time. The music was also great, and the film was shot beatifully.Overall, Machine Gun Preacher is a brilliant film with a powerful message.

Sam was a reformed bad guy, and seemed to be pretty bad in his time, as you will see in the very beginning of the film.The film begins in Sudan in 2003, showing a village being raided, burned, and whole families being butchered.  Then we flip back a few years to a town in Pennsylvania, USA, where Sam (Butler) is being released from prison.  He lives with his wife, daughter and mother.  He is nasty, his language is bad, he is involved with drugs and robbery, and has a real nasty temper.  One day, he decides to find Jesus, and begins going to church with his family, turning his life completely around.  He starts working in construction, and when he hears a Pastor from the Christian Ministries in Uganda speak, he decides he wants to go over there and help out for a couple of weeks.As you might guess, Sam gets caught up in the needs of many young children who cannot even sleep at night because ""Death Comes at Night in the Villages.""  All of this, in a land far away, that most of us will never see.  It is a wonderful story of a man who completely changes his life for the better, and in the process, makes a huge difference in the lives of many others.  His life proves that God does not only call certain people, but needs folks from all walks of life to carry his message of peace and love.  It also reminds us of the simple freedoms and necessities that many of us take for granted (toilets, food, being able to sleep at night, games, just being outside).  As of this movie, Sam lives today in Pennsylvania, still carrying out his activities and you will see pictures of Sam during the very end of the movie.Wonderful movie, but not for the young children.

1458336,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B005FITIDC,Mark Turner,"[4, 5]","I've always been a fan of Gerard Butler. Most found him interesting when he starred front and center on both PHANTOM OF THE OPERA and 300. I think he's been good not only in those films but the ones most right off as being bad like THE BOUNTY HUNTER and THE UGLY TRUTH. It takes a good actor to make a bad movie enjoyable and Butler has done so. His latest isn't a bad movie but he does make it one worth watching.Butler stars as Sam Childers, a biker about to be released from prison with a drug addiction problem who finds crime the easiest way to make a living. When he's released he returns home to discover that his wife Lynn (Michelle Monaghan) has given up her old ways. No longer working as a stripper, she has a respectable job and has found religion. Unhappy with this turn of events, Sam heads out to a bar with his friend and cohort Donnie (Michael Shannon).On their way home they pick up an Indian hitchhiker who threatens them with a knife. Sam takes the knife from him, stabs him repeatedly and tosses the body out of the car.Reaching home Sam tries to wash the blood off, horrified at what he has done. With Lynn at his side, she helps him find his way to God.Sam gets his act completely together. He starts a construction company and when he hears God talking to him builds a church for people like himself, outcasts from society who need a place to pray and find help. He rescues Donnie from the life he was once leading. When he meets a missionary from Africa talking about the atrocities that are going on there, he decides to investigate further.Heading to the Sudan he sees the effects of the war there on the children of the area. When he gets home he tells Lynn that God has called on him to build a refuge for these children and sets out to do so. Gathering any funds and donations he can, Sam does build the church and orphanage. But the LRA (Lord's Resistance Army) who stand against these children and their families take offense and attack his stockade. Picking up a weapon, Sam joins his protectors to run them off and a legend is born.Keeping the orphanage and church open is not an easy task and Sam is tested time and again for his beliefs. His fighting is rare if at all but that changes one night. On the way home after rescuing several children, Sam comes across a number of children stranded by the roadside. Only able to take so many in his truck, he promises to come back for the rest. By the time he does so he returns to find nothing more but their charring bodies burned by the LRA. This sends him over the edge and from then on he carries a weapon which he uses with more frequency.There is no real ending to this tale. Based on the true story of the real Sam Childers his fight carries on. During the closing credits we get to see footage of the real Sam as he talks about his journey and shows us the church here at home and in Africa. It is an inspiring story that some will side with and other condemn. Those who think everything must be done to save these children will side with Childers. Those who feel you must turn the other cheek will dismiss it. But once you get into the mind of this man who has sacrificed so much for so many, you won't have a choice but to admire him for who he is and what he accomplished.",3,VENGEANCE IS MINE...,1344470400,"08 9, 2012",2012,3264,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Most', 'found', 'interesting', 'when', 'starred', 'front', 'center', 'PHANTOM', 'THE', 'OPERA', '300', 'think', 'been', 'good', 'not', 'only', 'films', 'ones', 'most', 'right', 'off', 'being', 'bad', 'THE', 'BOUNTY', 'HUNTER', 'THE', 'UGLY', 'TRUTH', 'good', 'actor', 'make', 'bad', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'Butler', 'done', 'so', 'latest', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'make', 'one', 'worth', 'watching.Butler', 'stars', 'Sam', 'Childers', 'biker', 'be', 'released', 'prison', 'drug', 'addiction', 'problem', 'who', 'crime', 'easiest', 'way', 'make', 'living', 'When', 'released', 'home', 'discover', 'wife', 'Lynn', 'Michelle', 'Monaghan', 'given', 'up', 'old', 'ways', 'No', 'longer', 'working', 'stripper', 'respectable', 'job', 'found', 'religion', 'Unhappy', 'turn', 'events', 'Sam', 'out', 'bar', 'friend', 'cohort', 'Donnie', 'Michael', 'Shannon', '.On', 'way', 'home', 'pick', 'up', 'Indian', 'hitchhiker', 'who', 'knife', 'Sam', 'knife', 'stabs', 'repeatedly', 'body', 'car.Reaching', 'home', 'Sam', 'wash', 'blood', 'off', 'horrified', 'what', 'done', 'Lynn', 'side', 'find', 'way', 'God.Sam', 'act', 'completely', 'together', 'construction', 'company', 'when', 'God', 'talking', 'builds', 'church', 'people', 'society', 'who', 'need', 'place', 'pray', 'find', 'help', 'Donnie', 'life', 'was', 'once', 'leading', 'When', 'missionary', 'Africa', 'talking', 'atrocities', 'are', 'going', 'there', 'investigate', 'further.Heading', 'Sudan', 'effects', 'war', 'there', 'children', 'area', 'When', 'home', 'Lynn', 'God', 'called', 'build', 'refuge', 'children', 'out', 'do', 'so', 'Gathering', 'funds', 'donations', 'can', 'Sam', 'build', 'church', 'orphanage', 'LRA', 'Lord', 'Resistance', 'Army', 'who', 'stand', 'children', 'families', 'take', 'offense', 'attack', 'stockade', 'Picking', 'up', 'weapon', 'Sam', 'protectors', 'run', 'off', 'legend', 'born.Keeping', 'orphanage', 'church', 'open', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'Sam', 'tested', 'time', 'again', 'beliefs', 'fighting', 'rare', 'one', 'night', 'way', 'home', 'rescuing', 'several', 'children', 'Sam', 'number', 'children', 'stranded', 'roadside', 'Only', 'able', 'take', 'so', 'many', 'truck', 'come', 'back', 'rest', 'time', 'so', 'find', 'nothing', 'more', 'charring', 'bodies', 'burned', 'LRA', 'edge', 'then', 'weapon', 'more', 'real', 'ending', 'tale', 'Based', 'true', 'story', 'real', 'Sam', 'Childers', 'fight', 'closing', 'get', 'see', 'footage', 'real', 'Sam', 'journey', 'church', 'here', 'home', 'Africa', 'inspiring', 'story', 'will', 'side', 'other', 'condemn', 'who', 'think', 'everything', 'must', 'be', 'done', 'save', 'children', 'will', 'side', 'Childers', 'who', 'feel', 'must', 'turn', 'other', 'cheek', 'will', 'dismiss', 'once', 'get', 'mind', 'man', 'who', 'sacrificed', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'many', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'choice', 'admire', 'who', 'what', 'accomplished']",N/A

1458343,A3Q07NIIS6V2CT,B005FITIDC,"Mia N. Searles ""The Muses Circle""","[5, 6]","Machine Gun Preacher is one of those movies that sneaks up on you, grabs your heart, and doesn't let go. Going into this movie, I'm a bit embarrassed to say I not only hadn't heard of Sam Childers and his work over in Sudan and Uganda, but had no idea who Joseph Kony was, the leader of the LRA (Lord's Resistance Army). But I guess that is the point of movies like this-- to educate and inform people about very serious current issues going on in the world. As a blogger, a teacher, and the type of person that is not afraid to speak my mind, I knew before the end credits rolled that I would be reviewing Machine Gun Preacher and dedicating the post to the children of Uganda and Sudan and to spread awareness so that Kony's reign of terror will end.Gerard Butler does a great job portraying Sam Childers, former drug dealer, heroin addict, motorcycle misfit whose first moments on the screen is him being released after doing a stint in prison. I like the fact that the movie doesn't try to sugarcoat how Sam used to be--you can add verbally abusive to his wife and not much of a father figure to his daughter to the list. But after a life changing incident, he allows his wife to clean him up and take him to the church that helped her find God (she was also a former addict & stripper).Now many may think this movie is ""preachy"" since it shows Sam being baptized and he later builds his own church--but I'm setting the record straight, this movie's agenda is not to ""convert"" or ""recruit"" people to Christianity. This is not a film in the fashion of Fireproof and Courageous. The solid R rating should attest to that. But Sam IS a born again Christian and the movie IS about his life, so of course it's going to play an important part of the film. I just wanted to clear the air for those people that may have been thinking about skipping the film because they thought Machine Gun Preacher was going to be ""preachy"".I don't want to give too much away as far as describing specific scenes since I think this movie is much more effective by watching it with your own eyes, but let me say there are definitely some shocking moments when Sam is over in Africa. Children being maimed, tortured, burned, children forced to kill other children, etc. The one scene I will divulge that pissed me off-- as it did Sam-- was actually the scene where he asks a rich businessman who praised his work over in Africa, for $5,000 which would help keep the orphanage running for another 6 months. The man invites Sam and his family over to a huge, lavish party where he hands him an envelope. Sam excuses himself to the bathroom, opens it, to find a check for....$150 dollars! WTF?? Sometimes I forget how selfish and self centered people can be!What kept me from giving this movie a complete 5 star rating was more a directorial/writing/casting issue. The first thing that bothered me was the time transitions or lack there of. In the beginning of the movie, there was a little blurb that popped up to let everyone know what year it was. The rest of the film is not so kind. I'm not saying every scene needed a little blurb to let me know that time had passed, but there were definitely a few awkward time transitions that confused me. Most movies that are based on true stories will say something like, ""2 years later"" or something to help the viewer acclimate to the time change. In this movie, one minute Paige, Sam's daughter, is 5 years old, then she is suddenly in her young teens. This wouldn't be a big deal but I had to rewind it because while everyone else looked the same, there was an older actress playing Paige. I think a little blurb stating that time had passed would have been helpful.Another awkward scene is when Donnie, Sam's best friend, tries to take over his nightly duties as a father. It's sweet that while Sam was over in Africa, Donnie would keep an eye on Lynn and Paige. But there is just this part where Donnie is telling Paige goodnight, and she asks, ""Aren't you gonna read me a book?"" Followed by her saying her dad normally kisses her on the forehead and he can do that if he wanted to. Now this isn't the 5 year old Paige asking this. It is the 13-14 year old Paige asking. I work with middle/high school kids and...I don't know, I just felt that that particular scene was creepy and awkward. Not many kids that age that I know would ask their dad's friend for a kiss on the forehead. That's just my opinion!My last issue is a small one, more like a goof. There is a scene where Sam is at the airport to leave for Africa and Lynn, Paige, and Donnie walk him right up to the departing gate. I think everyone knows that doesn't happen anymore, especially after 9/11.Like I said, these are just minor issues I had. If you plan on buying Machine Gun Preacher, it is due out on dvd and blu-ray on June 5th. When you get your copy, make sure you don't turn the film off right away. While the end credits role, there is some real life photos and footage of the real Sam Childers, his close friends/freedom fights Deng and Marco, etc. For more information on how you can help get involved in the fight against Kony, the evil leader of the LRA, come check out my blog. I have a link on there that will take you to a site so that you can get involved. I am going to end this post with something the real Sam says:""For me to sit here and give all kinds of excuses to make it right, I can't do. But what I want to ask everyone out there, everyone that has a child, everyone that has a brother, a sister: if your child or family member was abducted today, if a mad man came in, a terrorist came in, abducted your family member or your child and if I said to you I can bring your child home...does it matter how I bring them home?"" --Sam ChildersMia at The Muses Circle (Like my review?

I used to work with violent youth and recognize how important it is for children to have a safe environment, and Sam was all about providing this most basic human need. I didn't like the way he preached, he seemed to be all about works, but I really can't know whether the movie correctly portrayed his life or not. And we are all growing in our faith as we walk.... I do think that his killing of the LRA was appropriate. And that the female medic was harsh in her evaluation of him.He entered into the most chaotic and violent situation when he joined forces with the freedom fighters, I applaud their accomplishments.

Oleson,"[2, 2]","There are numerous things wrong with this movie beginning with the title (sounds like something Tarantino or Rodriquez would make) and ending with its 2+ hour length.  There's also plenty right, perhaps beginning and ending with bringing attention to the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of innocent people on the African continent.You never know how much of the depicted events of a ""true"" story really happen but the overview seems uncontested.  Gang member and heroin addict Sam Childers (Gerard Butler) is released from a prison stint to find that his wife (Michelle Monaghan) has retired from her lucrative pole dancing career to work as a clerk.  It seems she has found Jesus and has been reborn.  After a hellish night on smack where Sam and his best friend Donnie (Michael Shannon) nearly kill a hitch hiker, Sam also sees the light.After Sam's conversion he has 2 missions.  One is to build a church and nursery in his eastern Pennsylvania community and second, to help the people of northern Uganda and southern Sudan which is being overrun by the Lord's Resistance Army headed by the vile Joseph Kony.  When Sam has some success in Pennsylvania, he underestimates the violence and political issues in Africa.  He has problems raising money, so begins to borrow against his house and eventually sells his successful construction business.  Sam slips off the deep end often.  Too often for my liking.  Still, Lynn (Monaghan) and his daughter (Madeline Carroll) stick with him even though his violent rages and financial malfeasance would usually bring on a lawyer at some point.This is where the director (Marc Forster) and writer (Jason Keller) seem to get carried away as well.  To their credit, however they don't shy away from the violence and unspeakable horrors that transpire to this day in east Africa.  Some absurdities aside, the film moves quickly and is technically well made.The 1080p transfer is generally well done and consistent with recent movies.  I did notice a bit of flickering on the opening scene but that may have been an aberration.  Overall the contrast is quite good and some of the African landscape is well presented.  The film is shot in 2.40:1 aspect ratio which is carried over here.  Although I don't talk about it much above, the film has numerous scenes of gun battles including automatic weapons, rockets and bombs.

1458365,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B005FITIDC,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","Machine Gun Preacher (Marc Forster, 2011)Marc Forster directed Quantum of Solace, to date my least favorite James Bond movie. Still, even that did not prepare me for the jaw-dropping idiocy that was Machine Gun Preacher. Even better, checking Forster's IMDB page shows that as of this writing he's also got a TV movie called Hand of God in pre-production. Two questions immediately come to mind. 1. When did Marc Forster find Jay-zus? (And how, if he has, was he enticed to direct the decidedly non-evangelical World War Z between the two?) 2. What in the flying hell possessed him to go back to the most ridiculous excesses of eighties-era evangelical film, rather than following farther down the road taken by more recent Christian filmmakers like Robby Henson (Thr3e) and Rafal Zielinski (Hangman's Curse)? Because those guys are making movies that are at least bearable even if you're a non-Christian. This is fund-raising, altar-call claptrap that has all the sincerity of The Cross and the Switchblade without any of the talent&#8212;which is pretty impressive given Forster behind the camera and the roster he put in front of it. Coriolanus aside, I should know better than to watch anything with Gerard Butler's name on it.Plot: as we open, Sam Childers (Butler) is a biker. He's being released from prison and on his way home. When he gets there, he finds that his wife Lynn (Gone Baby Gone's Michelle Monaghan) has gotten religion, and has the expected reaction&#8212;heading out to the usual bar to meet up with his old friend Donnie (Take Shelter's Michael Shannon) to do some drinking and drugging. As expected, Sam has his own come-to-Jesus moment not long after, and not only gets himself into the church, but pulls Donnie out of the life too, hallelujah and amen. Fast-forwarding through the slow bits, Childers is inspired by a preacher who comes to his church to go over to Uganda and do a bit of carpentry work. While he's there, he befriends Deng (Keep the Lights On's Souleymane Sy Savane), a Sudanese Liberation Army member who acquiesces to Childers' request to go &#8220;see some country&#8221;, taking him into war-torn south Sudan, where warlord Joseph Kony holds sway. As is the case with such things, Childers is inspired to set up shop in Sudan, building a church and an orphanage there, all the while seeming to not realize that the addiction that previously drove him to his drinking and drug excesses has simply found new roots in service.I will give the movie one thing: Forster and screenwriter Jason Keller (Escape Plan) never once flinch from portraying Childers as not a great guy, and when his devotion to service hits the same bottom as his last hellraising with Donnie, Butler portrays Childers as a true monster; it's the only time I've seen him on a screen other than in Coriolanus where I've been impressed with his acting abilities. (IMDB's trivia section notes that Childers uses the film as a fundraising tool on his speaking tours. They also note that the version shown in churches is &#8220;heavily edited&#8221;. One wonders how much of the editing has to do with the language and how much with the darker parts of Childers' character as portrayed by Butler.) The problem is that while the movie goes to great lengths to portray itself as one of those newfangled Thr3e-style movies that's &#8220;edgier&#8221; than the stuff turned out by the Kirk Cameron patrol (and before),  this is a case of the script following the letter of the law, not the spirit. This is as Old Time Gospel-y as any of those horrible movies I used to see in the lobby of the Assemblies of God church I attended in the mid-eighties, just with added violence and some cursin'. Simply put: this is terrible. *",1,"My son, my son, what have ye done?",1401148800,"05 27, 2014",2014,3731,"['Machine', 'Gun', 'Preacher', 'Marc', 'Forster', '2011', 'Marc', 'Forster', 'directed', 'Quantum', 'Solace', 'date', 'least', 'favorite', 'James', 'Bond', 'movie', 'Still', 'even', 'did', 'not', 'prepare', 'jaw-dropping', 'idiocy', 'was', 'Machine', 'Gun', 'Preacher', 'Even', 'better', 'checking', 'Forster', 'IMDB', 'page', 'writing', 'also', 'got', 'TV', 'movie', 'called', 'Hand', 'God', 'pre-production', 'Two', 'questions', 'immediately', 'come', 'mind', '1', 'When', 'did', 'Marc', 'Forster', 'find', 'Jay-zus', 'how', 'was', 'enticed', 'direct', 'decidedly', 'non-evangelical', 'World', 'War', 'Z', 'two', '2', 'What', 'flying', 'hell', 'possessed', 'go', 'back', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'excesses', 'eighties-era', 'evangelical', 'film', 'rather', 'following', 'road', 'taken', 'more', 'recent', 'Christian', 'filmmakers', 'Robby', 'Henson', 'Thr3e', 'Rafal', 'Zielinski', 'Hangman', 'Curse', 'guys', 'are', 'making', 'movies', 'are', 'least', 'bearable', 'even', ""'re"", 'non-Christian', 'fund-raising', 'altar-call', 'claptrap', 'sincerity', 'Cross', 'Switchblade', 'talent', '8212', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'given', 'Forster', 'camera', 'roster', 'put', 'front', 'Coriolanus', 'aside', 'should', 'know', 'better', 'watch', 'anything', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'name', 'it.Plot', 'open', 'Sam', 'Childers', 'Butler', 'biker', 'being', 'released', 'prison', 'way', 'home', 'When', 'there', 'wife', 'Lynn', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'Michelle', 'Monaghan', 'gotten', 'religion', 'expected', 'reaction', '8212', 'heading', 'usual', 'bar', 'meet', 'up', 'old', 'friend', 'Donnie', 'Take', 'Shelter', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'do', 'drinking', 'drugging', 'expected', 'Sam', 'own', 'come-to-Jesus', 'moment', 'not', 'long', 'not', 'only', 'church', 'Donnie', 'life', 'too', 'hallelujah', 'amen', 'Fast-forwarding', 'slow', 'bits', 'Childers', 'inspired', 'preacher', 'who', 'church', 'go', 'Uganda', 'do', 'bit', 'carpentry', 'work', 'there', 'Deng', 'Keep', 'Lights', 'Souleymane', 'Sy', 'Savane', 'Sudanese', 'Liberation', 'Army', 'member', 'who', 'Childers', 'request', 'go', '8220', 'see', 'country', '8221', 'taking', 'war-torn', 'south', 'Sudan', 'where', 'warlord', 'Joseph', 'Kony', 'sway', 'case', 'such', 'things', 'Childers', 'inspired', 'set', 'up', 'shop', 'Sudan', 'building', 'church', 'orphanage', 'there', 'while', 'seeming', 'not', 'realize', 'addiction', 'previously', 'drove', 'drinking', 'drug', 'excesses', 'simply', 'found', 'new', 'roots', 'service.I', 'will', 'give', 'movie', 'one', 'thing', 'Forster', 'screenwriter', 'Jason', 'Keller', 'Escape', 'Plan', 'never', 'once', 'flinch', 'portraying', 'Childers', 'not', 'great', 'guy', 'when', 'devotion', 'service', 'same', 'bottom', 'last', 'hellraising', 'Donnie', 'Butler', 'Childers', 'true', 'monster', 'only', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'screen', 'other', 'Coriolanus', 'where', ""'ve"", 'been', 'impressed', 'acting', 'abilities', 'IMDB', 'trivia', 'section', 'notes', 'Childers', 'film', 'fundraising', 'tool', 'speaking', 'tours', 'also', 'note', 'version', 'shown', 'churches', '8220', 'heavily', 'edited', '8221', 'One', 'how', 'much', 'editing', 'do', 'language', 'how', 'much', 'darker', 'parts', 'Childers', 'character', 'portrayed', 'Butler', 'problem', 'movie', 'great', 'lengths', 'portray', 'one', 'newfangled', 'Thr3e-style', 'movies', '8220', '8221', 'stuff', 'turned', 'out', 'Kirk', 'Cameron', 'patrol', 'case', 'script', 'following', 'letter', 'law', 'not', 'spirit', 'Old', 'Time', 'Gospel-y', 'horrible', 'movies', 'used', 'see', 'lobby', 'Assemblies', 'God', 'church', 'attended', 'mid-eighties', 'just', 'added', 'violence', 'cursin', 'Simply', 'put', 'terrible', '*']",N/A

This is the farthest from a Christian movie that you can get. It is fouled up so bad. Maybe they should have gotten Sherwood Baptist to film it. To sum it up....here is a quote from Plugged in Online:Inspiring. Devastating. Heartbreaking. Disturbing. Revelatory. Graphic. Raw. Those are just a few of the words that spring to mind as I ponder how to sum up Machine Gun Preacher, a complex, category-shattering story.On one hand, director Marc Forster (who helmed The Kite Runner, a similarly wrenching film) has served up a spiritually poignant story that evokes comparisons to the kind of movies Sherwood Pictures is making--movies like Courageous and Fireproof that unashamedly preach Jesus and show the difference He makes in someone's life. On the other, this deservedly R-rated film pulls absolutely no punches when it comes to hard-edged content: obscenity, violence, drug abuse and sex. In these areas, Machine Gun Preacher is much more akin to Schindler's List and The Apostle, both tales of similarly broken men desperately trying to find redemption in the midst of trying, sometimes brutal circumstances.Forster says of his protagonist, ""The fascinating thing about [Sam] is that he is a very flawed character. He has been abusive to himself and to others throughout his life. Those are just facts. At the same time, he has put his life on the line to save hundreds and hundreds of kids. There is this conflict within the character that makes for truly interesting storytelling.""""The movie definitely was not made for Christian people,"" Sam told me in a recent phone interview. ""I should say it was not made for religious people. I feel that every Christian person out there is going to want to hand tickets out. I think it's a great outreach. ... There's no way you can walk into the theater and walk out of the theater, and not be preached to in this movie. So it's like planting seeds. [The movie] shows a conversion. And it shows it in a raw way that most people in the world and of the world can relate to.""He's dead right about one thing: Anyone who watches this movie will be forced to grapple with some pretty significant questions. How do we respond to evil? Can God forgive our most heinous choices?

He is upset that his wife is now packing mushrooms and has stopped stripping, but not as upset as I was.Within 5 minutes, Sam reaches a point in his life where he will either die, go back to jail, or find the Jesus he dreads.

When Jesus sends a tornado through central Pa., it created a construction business for Sam, however the only way he can stop chasing the rabbit is to save his buddy. The next thing you know, he is off to Africa.Combining his Christian belief and bad boy past (which, believe it or not the movie downplayed) Sam decides he can help in Sudan and save part of it by building an orphanage (target) in a war zone. He discovers things are not that easy, even with God on your side. Sam becomes obsessed with Sudan to the point it effects his home life. The scenes have low level intensity.This is an excellent film. It is well acted with mediocre editing.

It is about a Pennsylvania biker and former alcohol/drug-addict ex-convict, who is converted to Christianity, goes to Uganda and South Sudan, and decides to dedicate his life to saving children, building an orphanage there. His name is Sam Childers (played by Gerard Butler) and he intends to protect these children, some of whom are abducted by a militant group the LRA (Lord's Resistance Army), and he does so, no matter what it takes.I will not discuss here the serious issue of ""child soldiers"" that has been around for many years, a topic that has been also taken up in such films as ""Johnny Mad Dog"" and ""Blood Diamond."" Director Marc Forster provides enough information for us to understand what Childers aka Machine Gun Preacher does to rescue the children in the social context of Africa and its political situations. The film includes several action set-pieces in which Childers fights back the attacking soldiers, but I think they are one or two too many. Violence is discreetly presented, but what is suggested is sometimes shocking.Gerard Butler, charismatic as ever, carries the film throughout almost single-handedly. Audiences may either admire or dislike the character he plays, but either way they will be fascinated by his strong performance. Part shot in South Africa, the on-location photography is credible. Soul&eacute;ymane Sy Savan&eacute; as Deng, a Sudanese telling Sam the harsh reality of his land is impressive.But most supporting characters are underwritten. It seems the subplot of Sam's friend Donnie (talented Michael Shannon, wasted) is heavily shortened, and so does the back story of Sam's wife Lynn Childers (Michelle Monaghan), even though some (including me) may find her character more intriguing than Sam Childers himself.

The Bible says, the greatest love of all is to lay your life down for another, which is what Sam Childers is doing.  I pray that God keep each and every person involved in this cause safe ,from Joseph Kony and the LRA, from the savagery and destruction they create in their reign of terror.

This movie is incredible, you can never take your eyes off of it, and whilst all the time you are waiting for Childers to take a bullet (especially when Kony puts a bounty on his head), there is never really a time when you think he can't survive all that he is given.The film starts in Sudan in 2003 and shows a village being burnt to the ground, but not before the pilledging, and plundering, and raping, and killing of young and old - all brought about by (the now fugitive) warlord Joseph Kony. We then go back a ""few years earlier"" to Pennsylvania, where Childers (Butler) is getting out of jail. Met by his long-suffering wife, Michelle Monaghan, he soon gets back into his bad ways re: drink, drugs, whoring, and robbing and killing!She has found The Lord since he was last away, he thinks that's funny, until one night he nearly kills a hitchhiker on the side of the road. Soon he joins her in Church, becomes re-baptised and slowly, but surely Childers takes on a whole new God-empowered persona. He builds his own church across the street from their new house, as now he has his own building contractor company, and when a visiting Pastor comes over from Uganda to tell of the troubles over there too, it's then he knows what he has to do.And therein falls the last two thirds of this glorious film. Childers invests all his time and efforts into building an Orphanage in Uganda, one that gets burnt down the first time, but not the second. He tries to make the streets safe for the kids (that are everywhere, scattered after the Kony raids), and even joins in when it's time to fight the rebels - hence the term, Machine Gun Preacher.At the end of the fim, which I won't give away, the credits roll and reveal that Amnesty International estimates that Kony and the LRA are responsible for over 400,000 murders and 40,00 child abductions alone! And that, to this day, Sam Childers STILL fights for the children of the Southern Sudan and Northern Uganda.Russell A.

Not just the Sudan but thru out Africa people are at war with one another in the most horrible way.
