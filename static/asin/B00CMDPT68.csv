1648782,A1LBGXE29GG1IR,B00CMDPT68,"Coffee Addicted Writer's Reviews ""Billy""","[2, 4]","The Canadian drama The Border is finally available on DVD for the first time in the United States thanks to Mill Creek Entertainment releasing the complete first season on a three-disc set, which sent me a free copy of the DVD in exchange for my honest review.The Border is a blend of NCIS and Law & Order, except the series focuses its attention on the fictional ICS (Immigration and Customs Security) agency as it protects the Canadian border from terrorist and smugglers. The agency is lead by Mike Kessler with Maggie Norton as his second-in-command, as they attempt to protect Canada from any threat.The episodes are:Disc One:Pockets of VulnerabilityGray ZoneBodies on the GroundGross DeceptionsSpecial Features:Cast & Crew CommentaryBehind the Scenes with the CastDisc Two:Compromising PositionsPhysical AssetsFamily AffairsEnemy ContactDisc Three:Restricted AccessNormalizing RelationsCivil DisobedienceGrave ConcernBlowbackI don't have access to Canadian television programs, so I didn't know what to expect from The Border, which plays out more like a 24 episode. The episodes are fast-paced, but can be slightly boring at times despite the fact the plots involve hunting down terrorists, tracking down hijacked planes, and stopping a money laundering scheme. Considering the ICS is a fake agency, it can feel like a bit of science-fiction than reality. They producers could at least used a real agency. Besides from Sofia Miles, I had never heard of any of the cast before, though they do a decent job with what little they have to work with. Overall, I found The Border to be moderately entertaining, and the DVD picture quality is wonderful, but I can easily see why the series only lasted three seasons.",3,Moderately Entertaining,1376870400,"08 19, 2013",2013,1716,"['Canadian', 'drama', 'Border', 'finally', 'available', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', 'United', 'States', 'thanks', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'Entertainment', 'releasing', 'complete', 'first', 'season', 'three-disc', 'set', 'sent', 'free', 'copy', 'DVD', 'exchange', 'honest', 'review.The', 'Border', 'blend', 'NCIS', 'Law', 'Order', 'series', 'attention', 'fictional', 'ICS', 'Immigration', 'Customs', 'Security', 'agency', 'Canadian', 'border', 'terrorist', 'smugglers', 'agency', 'lead', 'Mike', 'Kessler', 'Maggie', 'Norton', 'second-in-command', 'attempt', 'protect', 'Canada', 'threat.The', 'episodes', 'are', 'Disc', 'One', 'Pockets', 'VulnerabilityGray', 'ZoneBodies', 'GroundGross', 'DeceptionsSpecial', 'Features', 'Cast', 'Crew', 'CommentaryBehind', 'Scenes', 'CastDisc', 'Two', 'Compromising', 'PositionsPhysical', 'AssetsFamily', 'AffairsEnemy', 'ContactDisc', 'Three', 'Restricted', 'AccessNormalizing', 'RelationsCivil', 'DisobedienceGrave', 'ConcernBlowbackI', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'access', 'Canadian', 'television', 'programs', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'Border', 'out', 'more', '24', 'episode', 'episodes', 'are', 'fast-paced', 'can', 'be', 'slightly', 'boring', 'times', 'fact', 'plots', 'involve', 'hunting', 'down', 'terrorists', 'tracking', 'down', 'hijacked', 'planes', 'stopping', 'money', 'laundering', 'scheme', 'Considering', 'ICS', 'fake', 'agency', 'can', 'feel', 'bit', 'science-fiction', 'reality', 'producers', 'could', 'least', 'used', 'real', 'agency', 'Sofia', 'Miles', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'cast', 'do', 'decent', 'job', 'what', 'little', 'have', 'work', 'Overall', 'found', 'Border', 'be', 'moderately', 'entertaining', 'DVD', 'picture', 'quality', 'wonderful', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'why', 'series', 'only', 'lasted', 'three', 'seasons']",N/A
