1016944,AH4SL0YL5AQVU,B000HWZ4HU,Alric the Red,"[4, 5]","MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE was one of the very few 60s series I'd even think about revisiting, so I sprung forMission: Impossible (The Complete 1st Season).  To my disappointment, the show didn't match the intensity of my affection, which led to my acceptance of a couple of obvious facts.  Vintage TV series were manufactured by studios like a factory produces widgets.  To meet rapid shooting schedules and tight budgets, production values were often stinted, especially in effects-driven shows like this.  If you take into account your entertainment options at the time -- only THREE networks -- a studio could get away with some pretty clunky results.  This show was no exception.The first thing I noted was that the intricate and elegant planning that was the hallmark of the stories was missing from almost the entire first season.  Not until the last few episodes did it begin to hit its stride, to exploit what really made it clever.  During the best episodes, the audience witnesses a member of the crew performing solo some puzzling task in the course of IMF's meticulously interwoven subterfuge, the purpose for which would be revealed only later for a wonderfully satisfying ah-ha moment.  Those pleasures were absent for most of these early episodes, about two-thirds of them.  The writing was lazy and perfunctory, fobbing off a fight scene as an action sequence, which lacked real tension and misdirected focus from the foremost appeal of the show.  Many episodes included a karate chop to the neck as a quick remedy for many contingencies.  All of the shortcomings of pop-culture 60s television were featured in ample supply here, all backlot and soundstage, and it just didn't work for me at this point.  I admit to having some fun, but without a nostalgic component to transmute the experience, there's nothing a newer generation can appreciate; not as adults, anyway.  That it did by the end of the season come closer to the series I remembered wasn't enough to balance my heavier disappointment, and I wasn't so eager to jump forM:I's second season.  I will eventually go on ahead and buy it, because it was pretty good when it was at its best.  But I'm not in a hurry.As for the DVD set itself, it's been remastered with 5.1 sound and a picture that's sparkling bright and clean.  I can honestly say you've never seen or heard it like this.  Amazing, really.  The packaging for the 7-disc set is equally as classy, a glossy slipcase containing four plastic inner sleeves with two discs in each, with a final disc to itself.  The episodes are arranged chronologically according to the original air dates, precisely documented.  Unfortunately, there's not a single special feature included on any of the discs.  Not one.That omission is not a big deal really, not when you take into account THIS: Barbara Bain.  Man, I always thought she was one sultry, smoky beauty, in the classic mold.  But even in that superlative estimation, she was better than I remembered.  I just can't get over how stunningly beautiful she really was.  It's mesmerizing.___________________________________________________",4,"Good, but not as good as I remembered",1241049600,"04 30, 2009",2009,3110,"['MISSION', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'was', 'one', 'very', 'few', '60s', 'series', ""'d"", 'even', 'think', 'revisiting', 'sprung', 'forMission', 'Impossible', 'Complete', '1st', 'Season', 'disappointment', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'match', 'intensity', 'affection', 'led', 'acceptance', 'couple', 'obvious', 'facts', 'Vintage', 'TV', 'series', 'were', 'manufactured', 'studios', 'factory', 'widgets', 'meet', 'rapid', 'shooting', 'schedules', 'tight', 'budgets', 'production', 'values', 'were', 'often', 'stinted', 'especially', 'effects-driven', 'shows', 'take', 'account', 'entertainment', 'options', 'time', 'only', 'THREE', 'networks', 'studio', 'could', 'get', 'away', 'pretty', 'clunky', 'results', 'show', 'was', 'exception.The', 'first', 'thing', 'noted', 'was', 'intricate', 'elegant', 'planning', 'was', 'hallmark', 'stories', 'was', 'missing', 'almost', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'Not', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'did', 'begin', 'hit', 'stride', 'exploit', 'what', 'really', 'made', 'clever', 'best', 'episodes', 'audience', 'member', 'crew', 'performing', 'puzzling', 'task', 'course', 'IMF', 'meticulously', 'interwoven', 'subterfuge', 'purpose', 'would', 'be', 'revealed', 'only', 'later', 'wonderfully', 'satisfying', 'ah-ha', 'moment', 'pleasures', 'were', 'absent', 'most', 'early', 'episodes', 'two-thirds', 'writing', 'was', 'lazy', 'perfunctory', 'fobbing', 'off', 'fight', 'scene', 'action', 'sequence', 'lacked', 'real', 'tension', 'misdirected', 'focus', 'foremost', 'appeal', 'show', 'Many', 'episodes', 'included', 'karate', 'chop', 'neck', 'quick', 'remedy', 'many', 'contingencies', 'shortcomings', 'pop-culture', '60s', 'television', 'were', 'featured', 'ample', 'supply', 'here', 'backlot', 'soundstage', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'point', 'admit', 'having', 'fun', 'nostalgic', 'component', 'transmute', 'experience', 'nothing', 'newer', 'generation', 'can', 'appreciate', 'not', 'adults', 'anyway', 'did', 'end', 'season', 'come', 'closer', 'series', 'remembered', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'balance', 'heavier', 'disappointment', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'eager', 'jump', 'forM', 'second', 'season', 'will', 'eventually', 'go', 'ahead', 'buy', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'when', 'was', 'best', ""'m"", 'not', 'hurry.As', 'DVD', 'set', 'been', 'remastered', '5.1', 'sound', 'picture', 'sparkling', 'bright', 'clean', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'heard', 'Amazing', 'really', 'packaging', '7-disc', 'set', 'equally', 'classy', 'glossy', 'slipcase', 'containing', 'four', 'plastic', 'inner', 'sleeves', 'two', 'discs', 'final', 'disc', 'episodes', 'are', 'arranged', 'chronologically', 'according', 'original', 'air', 'dates', 'precisely', 'documented', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'single', 'special', 'feature', 'included', 'discs', 'Not', 'omission', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'really', 'not', 'when', 'take', 'account', 'THIS', 'Barbara', 'Bain', 'Man', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'sultry', 'smoky', 'beauty', 'classic', 'mold', 'even', 'superlative', 'estimation', 'was', 'better', 'remembered', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'how', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'really', 'was', 'mesmerizing.___________________________________________________']",Mission: Impossible - The Complete First TV Season

The series was just starting out and it tended to have greatly varied plots during the first season which made it exciting to watch. Dan Briggs seemed to be the perfect character to lead the IMF and I was not sure why he was replaced by Peter Graves until I read the write-up on his religious background. His no-nonsense approach was just what you would expect of someone in his position and he also had the added benefit of not being as well known as Peter Graves at the time, anonimity being a necessary part of undercover activities, which made him seem all the more real.

1016964,A1MF9JXT4U23Y2,B000HWZ4HU,Charles Wilcox,"[56, 60]","I have been waiting for years for this series to come out on DVD. This show was to secret agents what CSI is to crime drama and House is to medical mystery. Granted, the plots are a lot more fantastic than what you might see today; but stylistically, there are vague similarities, such as storylines that are plot-driven as opposed to character driven. You know very little about the personal lives of the members of the IMF team, save that they are not above vicious and sometimes even brutal tactics to bring down their foes -- so much so that the viewing audience often felt sorry for the villain of the week because the IMF messed them over so badly. Granted, the dialogue is a bit stagy, but the series is still years ahead of its time. A word of warning to those expecting Peter Graves in this collection: His character, Jim Phelps, did not appear until the second season, brought in to replace first season lead Steven Hill; but since this is a plot driven show, chances are, you won't miss Phelps. Martin Landau as Rollin Hand more than makes up for his absence. Besides, the first season episodes are some of the best of the entire run. And the subject matter has suddenly become topical and current with all the world unrest today. Sometimes it's hard to believe the show is a product of the sixties. In the pilot episode, for example, the IMF has to stop an ""unfriendly foreign power"" from attaining a nuclear weapon(sound familiar?)and a dictator who bears an eerie passing appearance to Saddam Hussein (actually Martin Landau in heavy makeup). One wishes there were a real IMF today . . . P.S. Ethan Hunt doesn't appear ANYWHERE! And for those of you who have only been exposed to the Tom Cruise fare, I urge you to give the original series a try.

Each episode opens with Dan Briggs being told that should his mission fail, the government that sent him out on it will happiliy lie to cover up their actions.  These instructions are familiar to everyone now, but taken in the context of the times they're pretty jaded and cold.  In the next scene Dan feeds his fish tank and selects that week's agents -- by sorting through their headshots, carnival bills and what look like dinner theater programs!  It's really silly and terrific.The shows vary in quality and a couple are a little dull, but by and large they're entertaining and have been crisply restored.  It's funny to watch a pre-craggy Stephen Hill as the team's mastermind. (Funnier still to watch him romance the gorgeous Mary Ann Mobley.)  You can watch his famed retreat from the show's center stage about 5 shows in when he can't take on missions because the parties involved would recognize him.  This sets the stage for what makes the show most watchable (besides television's best theme song) and that's Martin Landau as Rollin Hand.  Not the 60's most suave spy, but his edgy -- sometimes a little goofy -- perfomances enliven even the dullest capers.  He's absolutely great.And don't forget to play the M:I drinking game!

1016981,A2MNB9PF4QMK9P,B000HWZ4HU,"givbatam3 ""givbatam3""","[46, 49]","Those of you somewhat familiar with this classic television series may note that the title of this review is different than they remember. That is because, in this, the first season, the head of the Impossible Missions Force (IMF) was played by Steven Hill in the role of Dan Briggs, whereas in all the subsequent seasons, Peter Graves as Jim Phelps was the leader.  Hill gives a different flavor to the role, less physical but more cerebral.This first season is also different than the following ones because like most series, the show was finding its bearings.  Whereas most adventure shows in the 1960's were expected to have a generous helping of car chases, fist fights and gun shootouts, MI creator Bruce Geller wanted a different type of show, one that is plot oriented (as opposed to ""action oriented"" or ""character oriented"") and which requires the viewer to pay attention and think as several different threads of the story which are occurring simultaneously are drawn together at the end.  Thus, we see in the first season some episodes do have the car chases and shootouts, and we do see some banter between the characters, but these things were quickly phased out as the show settled into its familiar, unique  format that lasted seven seasons, as the entire program focuses on the IMF's elaborateplans to stop some evildoer.My favorite episodes from this season are ""Operation Rogosz"" and ""The Frame"".  The first is a story unfortunately quite relevant to today, in which an international terrorist tries to release lethal bacteriological agents into the Los Angeles water supply.  The other is about a plan by the IMF to eliminate a powerful Mafia boss (note how the word ""mafia"" is never used for""political correctness"" reasons, but rather ""the Syndicate"" or ""organized crime"") by making it seem that he was cheating on his partners in crime. Neither of these episodes have any ""action"" of the type I described above, but they are both riveting with outstanding acting and directing (director Leonard J Horn was particularly effective in ""Operation Rogosz"") and intricate stories.I do have some reservations about certain premises of the show, for example, although I have no expectation about the stories being ""realistic"", I do find situations where an IMF team member (usually Rollin Hand played by Martin Landau) impersonates somebody by wearing a mask looking like that person to be beyond the realm of credibility.  Also, whereas in some episodes, the IMF is able to overthow dictatorial goverments, stop or prevent wars and the such, and so when their entire weight is used to stop one man (as in ""The Frame"") it sort of makes you feel sorry for the poor guy since he doesn't stand a chance against them (in later seasons, as a result of the unpopularity of America's war in Vietnam, it became ""politically incorrect"" for the IMF to interfere in foreign countries so most of the stories became modified forms of the IMF removing some Mafia figure and this became stale after a while).This show has become a classic and will be remembered far into the future, just as Sherlock Holmes has.  I hope more seasons will be brought out in the future on DVD.",5,Good Morning Mr Briggs......,1157414400,"09 5, 2006",2006,3173,"['somewhat', 'familiar', 'classic', 'television', 'series', 'may', 'note', 'title', 'review', 'different', 'remember', 'because', 'first', 'season', 'head', 'Impossible', 'Missions', 'Force', 'IMF', 'was', 'played', 'Steven', 'Hill', 'role', 'Dan', 'Briggs', 'whereas', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'Peter', 'Graves', 'Jim', 'Phelps', 'was', 'leader', 'Hill', 'different', 'flavor', 'role', 'physical', 'more', 'cerebral.This', 'first', 'season', 'also', 'different', 'following', 'ones', 'most', 'series', 'show', 'was', 'finding', 'bearings', 'Whereas', 'most', 'adventure', 'shows', '1960', 'were', 'expected', 'have', 'generous', 'helping', 'car', 'chases', 'fist', 'fights', 'gun', 'shootouts', 'MI', 'creator', 'Bruce', 'Geller', 'wanted', 'different', 'type', 'show', 'one', 'plot', 'oriented', 'opposed', 'action', 'oriented', 'character', 'oriented', 'viewer', 'pay', 'attention', 'think', 'several', 'different', 'threads', 'story', 'are', 'occurring', 'simultaneously', 'are', 'drawn', 'together', 'end', 'Thus', 'see', 'first', 'season', 'episodes', 'do', 'have', 'car', 'chases', 'shootouts', 'do', 'see', 'banter', 'characters', 'things', 'were', 'quickly', 'phased', 'out', 'show', 'settled', 'familiar', 'unique', 'format', 'lasted', 'seven', 'seasons', 'entire', 'program', 'focuses', 'IMF', 'elaborateplans', 'stop', 'evildoer.My', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'Operation', 'Rogosz', 'Frame', 'first', 'story', 'unfortunately', 'quite', 'relevant', 'today', 'international', 'terrorist', 'tries', 'release', 'lethal', 'bacteriological', 'agents', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'water', 'supply', 'other', 'plan', 'IMF', 'eliminate', 'powerful', 'Mafia', 'boss', 'note', 'how', 'word', 'mafia', 'never', 'used', 'political', 'correctness', 'reasons', 'rather', 'Syndicate', 'organized', 'crime', 'making', 'seem', 'was', 'cheating', 'partners', 'crime', 'episodes', 'have', 'action', 'type', 'described', 'are', 'riveting', 'outstanding', 'acting', 'directing', 'director', 'Leonard', 'J', 'Horn', 'was', 'particularly', 'effective', 'Operation', 'Rogosz', 'intricate', 'stories.I', 'do', 'have', 'reservations', 'certain', 'premises', 'show', 'example', 'have', 'expectation', 'stories', 'being', 'realistic', 'do', 'find', 'situations', 'where', 'IMF', 'team', 'member', 'usually', 'Rollin', 'Hand', 'played', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'somebody', 'wearing', 'mask', 'looking', 'person', 'be', 'realm', 'credibility', 'Also', 'whereas', 'episodes', 'IMF', 'able', 'overthow', 'dictatorial', 'goverments', 'stop', 'prevent', 'wars', 'such', 'so', 'when', 'entire', 'weight', 'used', 'stop', 'one', 'man', 'Frame', 'sort', 'feel', 'sorry', 'poor', 'guy', ""n't"", 'stand', 'chance', 'later', 'seasons', 'result', 'unpopularity', 'America', 'war', 'Vietnam', 'became', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'IMF', 'interfere', 'foreign', 'countries', 'so', 'most', 'stories', 'became', 'modified', 'forms', 'IMF', 'removing', 'Mafia', 'figure', 'became', 'stale', 'while', 'show', 'become', 'classic', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'far', 'future', 'just', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'hope', 'more', 'seasons', 'will', 'be', 'brought', 'out', 'future', 'DVD']",Mission: Impossible - The Complete First TV Season

But, as a child, I didn't want to watch it. My Mom was hooked on it & didn't understand why I wouldn't give it a chance. Finally, she forced me to sit down to watch it one evening. I was hooked!So, I purchased this with great anticipation of watching this goldie oldie. I was disappointed. The producers were still trying to find their angle so they weren't sure which direction to take. The gadgetry that MI was so famous for didn't star occuring until the second half of season 1. In fact, I found the first half of it to be SLOW, especially the two part episode of the team performing as a circus act in an Eastern Bloc country. That two-parter was so padded out with filler as to be an insult to my intelligence.All the famous parts of Mission: Impossible were already in place, such as the opening introduction of the mission & the selection process of agents to be used. Steven Hill, the original team leader, is only in season 1 & it's easy to understand why he was replaced by Peter Graves in the following seasons.MR. Hill was too stiff & limited as an actor to be the dynamic leader of a crack team of infiltrators. In later episodes he would be gradually phased into a restricted role, not actually taking part in the mission; in fact, in one episode, Cinnamon (Barbara Bain), performed the opening sequences including the selection of agents.Viewer beware, season 1 is a weak effort compared, especially, to the next two seasons.

I followed it religiously and was a bitter as Barbara Bain was when it was cancelled. I've waited and waited for it to appear under one cover, and now am happy to say that, it having arrived, MI is as good as I hoped (and remembered). Those who recal the Peter Graves years should note that he wasn't the first director of the IMF, and that this first season seems a little mor earnest than the latter ones. I remeber that when we first saw it, we thought that the black-and-white room where they got their assignments seemed edgy, since we all remembered B&W TV, and that the throwback was original against this, being very early in color TV series. The stories in this first season are typical MI, and all revolve around a bad guy, a task, and a near escape. The beautiful woman gets to be beautiful, the strong man strong and so on. They pretty much all end with the IMF riding into the sunset. What makes this DVD release so special is the incredible care that went into the transfers and remastering.

1017000,A2SNYQC0AVWZZV,B000HWZ4HU,"J.T.J., an Author","[3, 4]","Perhaps my review is just one of many singing the praise of this set of DVDs. I had not seen an episode of this series in many years, and had forgotten many of the episodes from Season One, so going back and watching these programs was a real treat.Mission: Impossible first came to television in 1966. As anyone familiar with the time period knows, this was the vintage season of heroic spy entertainment in the movies and on TV. James Bond, of course, was wildly popular, and The Man from U.N.C.L.E. had a huge number of fans. Mission: Impossible, although arriving soon after those famous spies, was quite different. It focused on plot, subterfuge, chicanery, and disguise. Season One introduced us to these elements, and does so superbly in the pilot episode.I have not viewed each and every episode yet, but it appears to me that the writers and cast were trying to find their way. At times, it almost looks as if they want to ""go James Bond,"" in shootouts, fistfights, etc., but fortunately, most of the time, they resort to actions reflecting brain power. The real strength of the show is the plan of deception they serve so well to their  nasty adversaries.Steven Hill, the original star of the series, is exceptionally good. He looks, and sound like what we would imagine to be a real U.S. Government covert agent. His style, unlike that of his successor, Peter Graves, is quite different. He reminds me of someone who will snap, and kill an adversary in a heartbeat. He communicates daring, and deadliness while preferring to outsmart the devils. My only complaint about him as leader is his number of absences from episodes. True, he introduces each story, but it is a shame that he did not appear completely throughout more of them.Other performers in this first season are great. I believe that Martin Landau and Barbara Bain are practically flawless. One episode in particular features Landau as a Bacarat expert, and he could have give Sean Connery a run for his money! As for Barbara Bain, I was finding myself falling for her easily. Seldom has there been such a seductive woman on the screen. Greg Morris as Barney was incredible. He came across as one of the most brilliant people in the history of television. I really wish the C.I.A. did have someone to equal his talents!!!My one criticism of the collection: why aren't there interviews with surviving cast members? I would have loved to heard what Steven Hill, Barbara Bain, and Martin Landau had to say about the show four decades later. I can only hope that there will be interviews with cast members in future box sets released.I also look forward to successive seasons of this program coming out on DVD. Peter Graves took over as IMF leader beginning in Season Two. I have always been a fan of Peter Graves who always gave a terrific performance in any role (yes, he did a great deal more than the Geico ad, or the sicko-pilot in Airplane).A suggestion to anyone wanting to see one of the most entertaining, and original programs in the history of televion? Buy Mission: Impossible. These TV shows are not only vastly superior to the garbage that Tom Cruise put in his movies, but much better than nearly every other adventure show on television. This was one of the best ever.",4,"Season One Mission:Impossible, Accomplished",1173744000,"03 13, 2007",2007,3254,"['Perhaps', 'review', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'singing', 'praise', 'set', 'DVDs', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'episode', 'series', 'many', 'years', 'had', 'forgotten', 'many', 'episodes', 'Season', 'One', 'going', 'back', 'watching', 'programs', 'was', 'real', 'treat.Mission', 'Impossible', 'first', 'came', 'television', '1966', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'time', 'period', 'was', 'vintage', 'season', 'heroic', 'spy', 'entertainment', 'movies', 'TV', 'James', 'Bond', 'course', 'was', 'wildly', 'popular', 'Man', 'U.N.C.L.E', 'had', 'huge', 'number', 'fans', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'arriving', 'soon', 'famous', 'spies', 'was', 'quite', 'different', 'focused', 'plot', 'subterfuge', 'chicanery', 'disguise', 'Season', 'One', 'introduced', 'elements', 'so', 'superbly', 'pilot', 'episode.I', 'have', 'not', 'viewed', 'episode', 'yet', 'writers', 'cast', 'were', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'times', 'almost', 'want', 'go', 'James', 'Bond', 'shootouts', 'fistfights', 'etc.', 'fortunately', 'most', 'time', 'resort', 'actions', 'reflecting', 'brain', 'power', 'real', 'strength', 'show', 'plan', 'deception', 'serve', 'so', 'well', 'nasty', 'adversaries.Steven', 'Hill', 'original', 'star', 'series', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'sound', 'what', 'would', 'imagine', 'be', 'real', 'U.S.', 'Government', 'covert', 'agent', 'style', 'successor', 'Peter', 'Graves', 'quite', 'different', 'someone', 'who', 'will', 'snap', 'kill', 'adversary', 'heartbeat', 'daring', 'deadliness', 'preferring', 'outsmart', 'devils', 'only', 'complaint', 'about', 'leader', 'number', 'absences', 'episodes', 'True', 'story', 'shame', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'completely', 'more', 'them.Other', 'performers', 'first', 'season', 'are', 'great', 'believe', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'Barbara', 'Bain', 'are', 'practically', 'flawless', 'One', 'episode', 'particular', 'features', 'Landau', 'Bacarat', 'expert', 'could', 'have', 'give', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'run', 'money', 'Barbara', 'Bain', 'was', 'finding', 'falling', 'easily', 'Seldom', 'there', 'been', 'seductive', 'woman', 'screen', 'Greg', 'Morris', 'Barney', 'was', 'incredible', 'came', 'one', 'most', 'brilliant', 'people', 'history', 'television', 'really', 'wish', 'C.I.A', 'did', 'have', 'someone', 'equal', 'talents', 'one', 'criticism', 'collection', 'why', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'interviews', 'surviving', 'cast', 'members', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'heard', 'what', 'Steven', 'Hill', 'Barbara', 'Bain', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'had', 'say', 'show', 'four', 'decades', 'later', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'interviews', 'cast', 'members', 'future', 'box', 'sets', 'released.I', 'also', 'look', 'forward', 'successive', 'seasons', 'program', 'coming', 'out', 'DVD', 'Peter', 'Graves', 'took', 'over', 'IMF', 'leader', 'beginning', 'Season', 'Two', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Peter', 'Graves', 'who', 'always', 'gave', 'terrific', 'performance', 'role', 'yes', 'did', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'Geico', 'ad', 'sicko-pilot', 'Airplane', 'suggestion', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'see', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'original', 'programs', 'history', 'televion', 'Buy', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'TV', 'shows', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'vastly', 'superior', 'garbage', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'put', 'movies', 'much', 'better', 'nearly', 'other', 'adventure', 'show', 'television', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'ever']",Mission: Impossible - The Complete First TV Season

As a TV/DVD collector of primarily 60's-80's series and member of a couple of TV/DVD forums on the 'net, I can mention to all of the ""Amazon'ers"" out there that this is a gem that we've been wanting on DVD for years.  As for some of the ""Cruise"" posts, I saw the 1st MI film and, as others mentioned here, it's somewhat like comparing ""apples and oranges"".  From a TV/DVD collectors point of view, we want the (TV-series remake) films released, since in a lot of cases, the studios will release the original TV/DVD series as a market ""tie-in"" coinciding with the film release.  TV/DVD collectors may not purchase the film on DVD but in a lot of cases, the film ""gets the job done"" for the TV series release.  My favorite season of this series was S1.  I liked Steven Hill in the IMF Force Team Leader role just a little better than Peter Graves although I thought Graves did an outstanding job in the role after Hill left the series.  I also liked the original script line of  ""Please dispose of this recording in the usual manner"".  :)  What can we say about the ""Landau/Bain"" team on this show?  Classic!  And, what a casting jackpot for Greg Morris in the ""tech/electronics genius"" role :)This series is a must-buy for most of the TV/DVD collectors out there.  It's simply-put, a ""sure thing"" gem for your collection.  I only hope that additional seasons will make it to their release[s].  As the saying goes, ""It's all about the #'s"" (sales #'s).

As more and more TV shows were released in DVD boxed sets, I waited, first patiently, then impatiently, for the EXCELLENT Mission: Impossible series to be among them.  I couldn't understand why it was consistently overlooked!  I had no idea it was because of the sub-standard movies that had recently been cranked out!  Why the producers of the movies would think that DVD's of the series would adversely effect ticket sales is beyond me...unless they knew their products were inferior in comparison.I was too young to watch the first two seasons when they first aired.  I had a very early bedtime.  But after a babysitter let me see an episode from the third season, I was hooked!  I'd go to bed, then sneak downstairs and sit two feet away from the TV so the sound wouldn't draw attention and get me in trouble, to watch this incredible show!  Pretty soon my brother was sneaking down to join me!  Thankfully, by the last season we were both allowed to actually stay up and watch!Until I bought the VHS tapes of M:I several years ago (while waiting in line for a Harry Potter book to be released...either the second or third, I think!), I had no idea Peter Graves hadn't been in every episode.

Of course, the James Bond inspired plots are dated and the so called ""foreign country"" locales look way more domesticated than I remember as a kid but overall, the storytelling still stands out.I believe you will enjoy this show better if you can remember the times as they were back then.  In my judgment, the memory of the Cold War tension makes the show seem a bit more unsettling and riveting. To a younger viewer, it will be little more than escapist entertainment.  Funny, there were a few ""new"" things I noticed after all these years. First, my memory was that the show took itself very seriously.  However, now I notice snippets of dialog that prove the writers were capable of having some fun. Also, though television shows of the 60's were beginning to portray women as more than the wholesome and dutiful wives the 50's sitcoms etched in our minds, it is almost too extreme how Barbara Bain's only contribution to a mission seemed to be getting the bad guys aroused (In the pilot episode, Martin Landau's character even hints that the best use of his free time alone with her would be a quick roll in the sack). Of course, I imagine most male viewers weren't protesting. Finally, all those years ago, I never paid much attention to the irony that Rollin Hand (Martin Laundau) always bore an amazing resemblance to each person he was going to disguise himself as(ha, ha).My only complaint, as mentioned earlier, is the lack of extras. Several of the stars are still with us. What about some interviews?  This show ran for seven years. How about some sort of history?  And get this - we don't even get the original air dates of the episodes listed!  All we get is a note saying the episodes are in order.  Maybe it is just me expecting too much.  I just hate this ""let's not pay anyone we don't have to in order squeeze every penny of profit"" policy that Paramount seems to be displaying.  Come on Paramount, we live in an information age. Would it hurt to give us some?",4,An enjoyable romp through scary times,1174867200,"03 26, 2007",2007,2661,"['mentioned', 'review', 'nice', 'Paramount', 'Video', 'releasing', 'many', 'treasured', 'classic', 'products', 'libraries', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'do', 'not', 'show', 'tendency', 'completely', 'satisfy', 'fans', 'neglect', 'detailed', 'extras', 'believe', 'could', 'add', 'so', 'much', 'enjoyment', 'have', 'continued', 'pattern', 'Mission', 'Impossible-Season', '1', 'Technically', 'job', 'handled', 'well', 'However', 'are', 'first', 'season', 'have', 'business-like', 'Steven', 'Hill', 'leading', 'team', 'more', 'authoritarian', 'style', 'compared', 'somewhat', 'father-like', 'style', 'Peter', 'Graves', 'displayed', 'beginning', 'season', 'two', 'transfers', 'look', 'play', 'just', 'fine', 'course', 'James', 'Bond', 'inspired', 'plots', 'are', 'dated', 'so', 'called', 'foreign', 'country', 'locales', 'look', 'way', 'more', 'domesticated', 'remember', 'kid', 'overall', 'storytelling', 'still', 'out.I', 'believe', 'will', 'enjoy', 'show', 'better', 'can', 'remember', 'times', 'were', 'back', 'then', 'judgment', 'memory', 'Cold', 'War', 'tension', 'show', 'seem', 'bit', 'more', 'unsettling', 'riveting', 'younger', 'viewer', 'will', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'escapist', 'entertainment', 'Funny', 'were', 'few', 'new', 'things', 'noticed', 'years', 'First', 'memory', 'was', 'show', 'took', 'very', 'seriously', 'However', 'now', 'notice', 'snippets', 'dialog', 'prove', 'writers', 'were', 'capable', 'having', 'fun', 'Also', 'television', 'shows', '60', 'were', 'beginning', 'portray', 'women', 'more', 'wholesome', 'dutiful', 'wives', '50', 'sitcoms', 'etched', 'minds', 'almost', 'too', 'extreme', 'how', 'Barbara', 'Bain', 'only', 'contribution', 'mission', 'seemed', 'be', 'getting', 'bad', 'guys', 'aroused', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'character', 'even', 'best', 'use', 'free', 'time', 'alone', 'would', 'be', 'quick', 'roll', 'sack', 'course', 'imagine', 'most', 'male', 'viewers', 'were', ""n't"", 'protesting', 'Finally', 'years', 'ago', 'never', 'paid', 'much', 'attention', 'irony', 'Rollin', 'Hand', 'Martin', 'Laundau', 'always', 'bore', 'amazing', 'resemblance', 'person', 'was', 'going', 'disguise', 'ha', 'ha', 'only', 'complaint', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'lack', 'extras', 'Several', 'stars', 'are', 'still', 'What', 'interviews', 'show', 'ran', 'seven', 'years', 'How', 'sort', 'history', 'get', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'original', 'air', 'dates', 'episodes', 'listed', 'get', 'note', 'saying', 'episodes', 'are', 'order', 'Maybe', 'just', 'expecting', 'too', 'much', 'just', 'hate', 'let', 'not', 'pay', 'anyone', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'order', 'squeeze', 'penny', 'profit', 'policy', 'Paramount', 'be', 'displaying', 'Come', 'Paramount', 'live', 'information', 'age', 'Would', 'hurt', 'give']",Mission: Impossible - The Complete First TV Season

CBS has done an excellent job in restoring each episode and they look as pristine as when the show premiered in 1966. Clever and thoughtful, Mission Impossible was considered one of the elite shows of its day (along with I Spy and Ironside). The episodes were well plotted and a relief from the gun toting spy shows that populated the air waves during the James Bond mania of the era. The show made Martin Landau, Barbara Bain and Greg Morris household names and international stars.  Unfortunately, the fine actor Steven Hill (Dan Briggs) became a footnote in the history of the show--leaving after the first year. What is not well known was the reason why----as a devout Orthodox Jew, Steven could not and would not work after sundown on Fridays. And with the typical brutal filming schedules required of episode TV, it cause work delays.

The leader of the team in season 1 is Dan Briggs, played low-key by Steven Hill (the DA for the first nine years of ""Law & Order""), replaced in season 2 by Peter Graves' Jim Phelps.  Over the course of the first season, Barbara Bain, playing Cinnamon Carter (a ""space-age Mata Hari,"" according to Look Magazine at the time), becomes a star before your eyes.  Her charisma and that of then-husband Martin Landau made major contributions to the series' impact, even though they appeared only in the first three (of seven) seasons.

1017016,AL4MKKO24563R,B000HWZ4HU,Michael K. Beusch,"[411, 459]","When Mission: Impossible, the movie came out, I was expecting a big studio update of the classic TV show. What I got was yet another Tom Cruise star vehicle where he preens and postures and seizes the spotlight at the expense of everyone else in the film. To say I was disappointed is an understatment -- I was incensed! The IMF team killed off? Jim Phelps a bad guy? You've got to be kidding me! The TV series' concept of an elite covert operations team working together to save the United States from enemies, both foreign and domestic, was bastardized so Tom Cruise could flash his 1000 watt smile and save the day all by himself. I was so angry, I vowed to never see the film again or any possible sequels. It's a vow I've kept to this day and will continue to keep.I'm sure that Mr. Cruise and his represtatives had something to do with the delay in releasing the original series on DVD. Thankfully, now that Paramount has shown old Tom the door, we can now see the series that started it all. Peter Graves' Jim Phelps is missing from the first season (Steven Hill of Law and Order plays Dan Riggs, the leader of the IMF during the first season). But Martin Landau as Rollin Hand, Barbara Bain as Cinnamon Carter, Greg Morris as Barney Collier and Peter Lupus as Willy Armitage are all present. Unlike most of the spy stories from the 1960's (and unlike the Tom Cruise film series), Mission:Impossible, the TV series, took a more cerebral approach to its stories. There's no James Bond in these stories -- just a team of agents who covertly depose all types of dictators, terrorists and traitors without leaving any evidence of their involvement. Just as Columbo turned the TV detective genre on its ear so did Mission:Impossible turn the spy genre on its ear.Here's hoping that those who only know Mission:Impossible from the films have a look for themselves. I daresay they'll realize that the TV series is vastly superior to the film series and that the complete absence of Tom Cruise is a very, very good thing.",5,"FINALLY: Hill, Landau, Bain, Morris, Lupus AND NO CRUISE!",1157760000,"09 9, 2006",2006,2020,"['When', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'expecting', 'big', 'studio', 'update', 'classic', 'TV', 'show', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'yet', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'star', 'vehicle', 'where', 'postures', 'spotlight', 'expense', 'everyone', 'else', 'film', 'say', 'was', 'disappointed', 'understatment', 'was', 'incensed', 'IMF', 'team', 'killed', 'off', 'Jim', 'bad', 'guy', ""'ve"", 'got', 'be', 'kidding', 'TV', 'series', 'concept', 'elite', 'covert', 'operations', 'team', 'working', 'together', 'save', 'United', 'States', 'enemies', 'foreign', 'domestic', 'was', 'bastardized', 'so', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'could', 'flash', '1000', 'watt', 'smile', 'save', 'day', 'was', 'so', 'angry', 'vowed', 'never', 'see', 'film', 'again', 'possible', 'sequels', 'vow', ""'ve"", 'kept', 'day', 'will', 'continue', 'keep.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Mr.', 'Cruise', 'represtatives', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'delay', 'releasing', 'original', 'series', 'DVD', 'Thankfully', 'now', 'Paramount', 'shown', 'old', 'Tom', 'door', 'can', 'now', 'see', 'series', 'started', 'Peter', 'Graves', 'Jim', 'Phelps', 'missing', 'first', 'season', 'Steven', 'Hill', 'Law', 'Order', 'plays', 'Dan', 'Riggs', 'leader', 'IMF', 'first', 'season', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'Rollin', 'Hand', 'Barbara', 'Bain', 'Cinnamon', 'Carter', 'Greg', 'Morris', 'Barney', 'Collier', 'Peter', 'Lupus', 'Willy', 'Armitage', 'are', 'present', 'most', 'spy', 'stories', '1960', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'film', 'series', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'TV', 'series', 'took', 'more', 'cerebral', 'approach', 'stories', 'James', 'Bond', 'stories', 'just', 'team', 'agents', 'who', 'covertly', 'depose', 'types', 'dictators', 'terrorists', 'traitors', 'leaving', 'evidence', 'involvement', 'Just', 'Columbo', 'turned', 'TV', 'detective', 'genre', 'ear', 'so', 'did', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'turn', 'spy', 'genre', 'hoping', 'who', 'only', 'know', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'films', 'have', 'look', 'daresay', ""'ll"", 'realize', 'TV', 'series', 'vastly', 'superior', 'film', 'series', 'complete', 'absence', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'thing']",Mission: Impossible - The Complete First TV Season

I was mesmerized by the gadgets, clipped dialog, and missions that worked like puzzle boxes, and anxious whether the team would escape after accomplishing their plan.  Of course, I was also anxious whether Batman and Robin would escape the fiendish plots to kill them every Wednesday night; by Thursday, they were always safe and sound.I had never seen any of the first season before, so I was unfamiliar with Steven Hill's role of Dan Briggs, which was replaced in the second season with the more familiar Peter Graves playing Jim Phelps.  This DVD set is an excellent way to observe the development of the show.  The set dressing and plots of the early shows are not as strong as the later episodes, and watching as a 40-something meant I had to suspend attention to details that escaped me when I was eight years old.  For example, a casino in one episode was redecorated to be a police station in the next; the elevator to a basement vault at the end of one story was in a hospital two weeks later (and since when do elevators have walls made of cinder blocks?).  But these were attributes of the time.  Perhaps one-third of the way into the season (and yes, I did watch all 28 episodes), there's a marked increase in quality.  Quality in stories -- Cinnamon becomes something more than eye candy; the group acts less as con artists and more as special ops; Barney has more gadgets to play with.  Quality in production values.  Quality in guest stars, including Arthur Hill, Carroll O'Connor, J.D. Cannon, Pat Hingle, and Ricardo Montalban.  And quality in the incidental music, which sounds like it was also written by Lalo Schifrin.  Of course, the unimitable theme still stirs my blood whenever I hear it.The DVDs have no special features but otherwise are fine; good picture and sound quality.  The package of 7 discs is packaged economically in a thin box and won't wipe out one shelf of your storage racks.All in all, a nice package of an interesting show.

Gorgeous gals for the guys, bulging muscles and a handsome face for the gals, and (usually) a plot which will keep us all entertained for the hour the show runs. And while the plots are not great inof themselves, the joy is in watching the IMF pull the operation off. It's like watch a Rube Goldberg fabrication in action. You know the outcome, but watching the machine work is fascinating.I just received my set and look forward to acquiring the entire collection as it is made available. The transfer to DVD is crisp and clear with excellent audio. No extras to speak of, but that's okay ... I like the show.One peculiarity I've noticed on my set is that when the DVD is first inserted, no matter which of the episodes I select, the third one plays. It does this until I select the third one and stop it. Then I can pick the one I want to see. While this is not a big detractor from the set, it is an oddity and can get in the way if you want to see a particular episode.Oh well....For anyone that hasn't seen the original series and judges MI by the movie remakes (I've never seen any of them, and don't appear to be missing much), read any of the reviews here and at least rent the set for an evening or two.

As I understand it, they just did not show up for the rehearsal and taping of a particular episode. She was black balled and she is still to this day. No work for her then and even now into old age.

1017044,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,B000HWZ4HU,Simon,"[9, 9]","Having been born well after the original series ended its run, Mission: Impossible was something I'd only caught in brief re-runs on TV, and through the revival series that aired in the 80s. But I'd seen enough of it for the show to leave a lasting impression, and knew that the Tom Cruise films were nothing like the series.So I took a gamble on the first season, and it's a blast to watch. The show holds up really well, with intricate plots that take things seriously and avoid the usual sixties cheese. The formula for each show is standard, but there are enough curveballs and variations to keep things interesting. Production values seem pretty high for this kind of retro fare; considering they had to come up with a different, fictitious country every week, there's a good mixture of indoor and backlot sets to get the idea across. And while Jim Phelps isn't head of IMF at this point, Steven Hill as Dan Briggs is a capable team leader and active field agent. He gets the series off on the right foot.If you enjoy more laid-back stuff that doesn't rely on explosions and music video edits, Mission: Impossible is highly recommended.

Under the command of Dan Briggs (cerebral Steven Hill), the IMF team went head to head each week with a villain entirely plausible, then and now.  In fact, some plots could be ripped from today's headlines, as the team took down everyone from heroin czars to petty dictators to fanatical terrorists to local mafioso.  During the first season, before the likable but lightweight Peter Graves would inexplicably replace Hill's tough-as-nails mission leader, the show easily stood out as high quality, even with great shows like ""The Man from UNCLE,"" ""The Wild, Wild West,"" ""Secret Agent,"" and ""The Avengers"" in the mix.  (""I Spy"" comes closest in feel to the early ""Mission:  Impossible,"" and was nearly as unique in helping to redefine expectations for the genre.)  The first season also made the best use of the ensemble cast, who all look great, allowing in particular the spectacular husband-and-wife team of Martin Landau and Barbara Bain to shine without overshadowing Hill, Peter Lupus, or Greg Morris.  By the second season, the show would start to give way to more conventional plots and characters, succumbing, too, to the gimmicky camera work most associated with the late 1960s -- the shaky hand held, the dark, soft focus, and the dreaded quick zoom.  Among the guest stars this season are Lloyd Bridges, Simon Oakland, Eartha Kitt, Joseph Campanella, John Collicos, Fritz Weaver, Arthur Hill, George Takei, Albert Dekker, Jill Gordon, and Percy Rodriguez.",5,Some of the Finest Television Ever in the U.S.,1180310400,"05 28, 2007",2007,1704,"['first', 'season', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'easily', 'best', 'episodes', 'were', 'filmed', 'creative', 'economic', 'style', 'scripts', 'tightly', 'written', 'pacing', 'wonderfully', 'tense', 'mood', 'suitably', 'low', 'key', 'acting', 'first', 'rate', 'command', 'Dan', 'Briggs', 'cerebral', 'Steven', 'Hill', 'IMF', 'team', 'went', 'head', 'head', 'week', 'villain', 'entirely', 'plausible', 'then', 'now', 'fact', 'plots', 'could', 'be', 'ripped', 'today', 'headlines', 'team', 'took', 'down', 'everyone', 'heroin', 'czars', 'petty', 'dictators', 'fanatical', 'terrorists', 'local', 'mafioso', 'first', 'season', 'likable', 'lightweight', 'Peter', 'Graves', 'would', 'inexplicably', 'replace', 'Hill', 'tough-as-nails', 'mission', 'leader', 'show', 'easily', 'stood', 'out', 'as', 'high', 'quality', 'even', 'great', 'shows', 'Man', 'UNCLE', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'Secret', 'Agent', 'Avengers', 'mix', 'Spy', 'closest', 'feel', 'early', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'was', 'nearly', 'as', 'unique', 'helping', 'redefine', 'expectations', 'genre', 'first', 'season', 'also', 'made', 'best', 'use', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'who', 'look', 'great', 'allowing', 'particular', 'spectacular', 'husband-and-wife', 'team', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'Barbara', 'Bain', 'shine', 'overshadowing', 'Hill', 'Peter', 'Lupus', 'Greg', 'Morris', 'second', 'season', 'show', 'would', 'start', 'give', 'way', 'more', 'conventional', 'plots', 'characters', 'succumbing', 'too', 'gimmicky', 'camera', 'work', 'most', 'associated', 'late', '1960s', 'shaky', 'hand', 'held', 'dark', 'soft', 'focus', 'dreaded', 'quick', 'zoom', 'guest', 'stars', 'season', 'are', 'Lloyd', 'Bridges', 'Simon', 'Oakland', 'Eartha', 'Kitt', 'Joseph', 'Campanella', 'John', 'Collicos', 'Fritz', 'Weaver', 'Arthur', 'Hill', 'George', 'Takei', 'Albert', 'Dekker', 'Jill', 'Gordon', 'Percy', 'Rodriguez']",Mission: Impossible - The Complete First TV Season

1017056,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000HWZ4HU,trebe,"[4, 4]","To the tune of composer Lalo Schifrin's pulse pounding theme, Bruce Geller's Mission Impossible came to TV in 1966 at the height of the `spy craze', with a deadly serious take on international espionage, Mission was all about deception, and the precise execution of the most elaborate of schemes, by a specialized team of operatives employed by the US government to accomplish policy aims.Overall, the stories hold together pretty well.  While not always credible, they are still exciting, entertaining, and full of suspense.  There is wide variety in the types of missions, the locations, and the methods used to complete them.  Sometimes subtle manipulation was required, other times a bold dramatic approach, or a smooth sophisticated con job.  Missions often featured the use of technology, both real and fictional.  Cool mechanical devices or gadgets, were often integral to success.  They may not have invented it, but the series' writers certainly popularized the rather unrealistic technique of the rubber mask impersonation, which became a trademark of the series.  Mostly they played fair, but at times the writers did cheat a bit, especially at the endings when things are not tied up neatly, or by making the escapes too easy.  Getting everything done in just an hour was sometimes a challenge, so the occasional sloppiness is understandable.With one exception, the cast was very strong, and worked together well.  Though a capable enough actor, Steven Hill seemed rather stiff and lacking charisma, as Dan Briggs, the leader of the IMF.  Hill had a reputation for being difficult, and his religion placed restrictions on his availability for work.  After a strong a prominent start, Briggs fades away to just being a setup man for the missions, after problems arose between Hill and the producers.  He practically disappears in some of the later episodes.Real life husband and wife, Martin Landau as Rollin Hand, and Barbara Bain as Cinnamon Carter are the true stars of the program.  Both smoothly assume the many diverse roles required of them.  Hand was an expert at physical impersonation, and was often the point man for the mission.  Landau apparent had reservations about committing to the series, and so he was not listed as one of the regular cast, and instead was credited as making `special guest appearances' in each episode.  Ms. Bain brought so much class, elegance and acting talent to the screen as Cinnamon Carter, that she won the Emmy for best actress in a dramatic series, for each of the three years she was on MI.  You could count on Cinnamon to add `spice' to the proceedings.Greg Morris brought class and dignity to the proceedings, as the low-key electronics expert Barney Collier.  Barney could handle any situation, was icy cool under pressure, and always had your back.  Likeable bodybuilder turned actor, Peter Lupus is rock steady as operative Willy Armitage.  Willy seems to have more to do in this season than he would in later years.  In some of the later episodes, he probably has as much screen time as Steven Hill!Although there were some creative bumps, the style and the level of quality was firmly established in this first season.  The producers replaced Steven Hill with Peter Graves for the second season.  A move which most fans would probably agree was a positive one, as the show increased in popularity with Graves aboard.  After Mission, Hill apparently gave up acting for a time, but later returned to prime time on Law and Order in the 1980's.",4,Light the fuse . . .,1201910400,"02 2, 2008",2008,3505,"['tune', 'composer', 'Lalo', 'Schifrin', 'pulse', 'pounding', 'theme', 'Bruce', 'Geller', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'came', 'TV', '1966', 'height', 'spy', 'craze', 'deadly', 'serious', 'take', 'international', 'espionage', 'Mission', 'was', 'deception', 'precise', 'execution', 'most', 'elaborate', 'schemes', 'specialized', 'team', 'operatives', 'employed', 'US', 'government', 'accomplish', 'policy', 'aims.Overall', 'stories', 'hold', 'together', 'pretty', 'well', 'not', 'always', 'credible', 'are', 'still', 'exciting', 'entertaining', 'full', 'suspense', 'wide', 'variety', 'types', 'missions', 'locations', 'methods', 'used', 'complete', 'Sometimes', 'subtle', 'manipulation', 'was', 'required', 'other', 'times', 'bold', 'dramatic', 'approach', 'smooth', 'sophisticated', 'con', 'job', 'Missions', 'often', 'featured', 'use', 'technology', 'real', 'fictional', 'Cool', 'mechanical', 'devices', 'gadgets', 'were', 'often', 'integral', 'success', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'invented', 'series', 'writers', 'certainly', 'popularized', 'rather', 'unrealistic', 'technique', 'rubber', 'mask', 'impersonation', 'became', 'trademark', 'series', 'Mostly', 'played', 'fair', 'times', 'writers', 'did', 'cheat', 'bit', 'especially', 'endings', 'when', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'tied', 'up', 'neatly', 'making', 'escapes', 'too', 'easy', 'Getting', 'everything', 'done', 'just', 'hour', 'was', 'sometimes', 'challenge', 'occasional', 'sloppiness', 'understandable.With', 'one', 'exception', 'cast', 'was', 'very', 'strong', 'worked', 'together', 'well', 'capable', 'enough', 'actor', 'Steven', 'Hill', 'seemed', 'rather', 'stiff', 'lacking', 'charisma', 'Dan', 'Briggs', 'leader', 'IMF', 'Hill', 'had', 'reputation', 'being', 'difficult', 'religion', 'placed', 'restrictions', 'availability', 'work', 'strong', 'prominent', 'start', 'Briggs', 'away', 'just', 'being', 'setup', 'man', 'missions', 'problems', 'arose', 'Hill', 'producers', 'practically', 'later', 'episodes.Real', 'life', 'husband', 'wife', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'Rollin', 'Hand', 'Barbara', 'Bain', 'Cinnamon', 'Carter', 'are', 'true', 'stars', 'program', 'smoothly', 'assume', 'many', 'diverse', 'roles', 'required', 'Hand', 'was', 'expert', 'physical', 'impersonation', 'was', 'often', 'point', 'man', 'mission', 'Landau', 'apparent', 'had', 'reservations', 'committing', 'series', 'so', 'was', 'not', 'listed', 'one', 'regular', 'cast', 'instead', 'was', 'credited', 'making', 'special', 'guest', 'appearances', 'episode', 'Ms.', 'Bain', 'brought', 'so', 'much', 'class', 'elegance', 'acting', 'talent', 'screen', 'Cinnamon', 'Carter', 'won', 'Emmy', 'best', 'actress', 'dramatic', 'series', 'three', 'years', 'was', 'MI', 'could', 'count', 'Cinnamon', 'add', 'spice', 'proceedings.Greg', 'Morris', 'brought', 'class', 'dignity', 'proceedings', 'low-key', 'electronics', 'expert', 'Barney', 'Collier', 'Barney', 'could', 'handle', 'situation', 'was', 'icy', 'cool', 'pressure', 'always', 'had', 'back', 'Likeable', 'bodybuilder', 'turned', 'actor', 'Peter', 'Lupus', 'rock', 'steady', 'operative', 'Willy', 'Armitage', 'Willy', 'have', 'more', 'do', 'season', 'would', 'later', 'years', 'later', 'episodes', 'probably', 'as', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'Steven', 'Hill', 'were', 'creative', 'bumps', 'style', 'level', 'quality', 'was', 'firmly', 'established', 'first', 'season', 'producers', 'replaced', 'Steven', 'Hill', 'Peter', 'Graves', 'second', 'season', 'move', 'most', 'fans', 'would', 'probably', 'agree', 'was', 'positive', 'one', 'show', 'increased', 'popularity', 'Graves', 'aboard', 'Mission', 'Hill', 'apparently', 'gave', 'up', 'acting', 'time', 'later', 'returned', 'prime', 'time', 'Law', 'Order', '1980']",Mission: Impossible - The Complete First TV Season

1017061,A3KF8A4ESRHPCI,B000HWZ4HU,William K. Lasley,"[22, 22]","To this day, no TV series has demanded as much attention from the viewer.  Instead of dumbing us down, this show insisted that we heighten our senses.  The basic structure of a MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE episode as they are now remembered was still forming in the first season with various plot styles being tested.  This super-sophisticated series got better and better throughout the second and third seasons, but expect great things from this daring, ground-breaking, successful, and popular first year.  One reviewer has written that the episodes seem dated with 1960's-style TV production.  On the contrary, these ""mini motion pictures"" pushed television filming to new heights of artistic and technical sophistication.  The frequent rapid-fire cutting/editing resulted in most episodes containing double the number of shots found in any other TV series episodes.  The intricate plots cannot be followed by those numbed by today's ""think-it-for-you"" method of storytelling.  The meaning of certain events as they occur throughout the episodes will be lost to ""viewers"" who don't relish the requirement of complete concentration.  These factors are a large part of what makes MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE great.  The show is a rare opportunity to be more deeply involved in your entertainment than you probably ever have before.What makes this DVD set all the more a discovered holy grail is that the picture and sound quality are absolutely superb.  MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE could never have looked this good, even when it was new in the sixties.  And you have the option of listening in original mono or remastered 5.1 stereo!  Wow, that opening music is awesome, being one of the greatest of all TV themes.  Another reviewer has complained about the lack of bonuses in the set.  The episodes ARE the features.  They were and still are a wonderful bonus gift in this world of entertainment sameness.  Sure, no series is more deserving of study and documentation as this one, but the episodes stand alone as supreme quality product.  Extras would be greatly appreciated, but are not necessary, as MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE on DVD is indeed an awesome, super-cool, long-awaited, much anticipated revealing of a long-lost holy grail.Good luck viewer...",5,The Peak of 1960's TV from the USA!,1166918400,"12 24, 2006",2006,2228,"['day', 'TV', 'series', 'demanded', 'much', 'attention', 'viewer', 'Instead', 'dumbing', 'down', 'show', 'insisted', 'heighten', 'senses', 'basic', 'structure', 'MISSION', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'episode', 'are', 'now', 'remembered', 'was', 'still', 'forming', 'first', 'season', 'various', 'plot', 'styles', 'being', 'tested', 'super-sophisticated', 'series', 'got', 'better', 'better', 'second', 'third', 'seasons', 'expect', 'great', 'things', 'daring', 'ground-breaking', 'successful', 'popular', 'first', 'year', 'One', 'reviewer', 'written', 'episodes', 'seem', 'dated', ""1960's-style"", 'TV', 'production', 'contrary', 'mini', 'motion', 'pictures', 'pushed', 'television', 'filming', 'new', 'heights', 'artistic', 'technical', 'sophistication', 'frequent', 'rapid-fire', 'cutting/editing', 'resulted', 'most', 'episodes', 'containing', 'double', 'number', 'shots', 'found', 'other', 'TV', 'series', 'episodes', 'intricate', 'plots', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'followed', 'numbed', 'today', 'think-it-for-you', 'method', 'storytelling', 'meaning', 'certain', 'events', 'occur', 'episodes', 'will', 'be', 'lost', 'viewers', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'relish', 'requirement', 'complete', 'concentration', 'factors', 'are', 'large', 'part', 'what', 'MISSION', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'great', 'show', 'rare', 'opportunity', 'be', 'more', 'deeply', 'involved', 'entertainment', 'probably', 'ever', 'have', 'before.What', 'DVD', 'set', 'more', 'discovered', 'holy', 'grail', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'MISSION', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'could', 'never', 'have', 'looked', 'good', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'new', 'sixties', 'have', 'option', 'listening', 'original', 'mono', 'remastered', '5.1', 'stereo', 'Wow', 'opening', 'music', 'awesome', 'being', 'one', 'greatest', 'TV', 'themes', 'reviewer', 'complained', 'lack', 'bonuses', 'set', 'episodes', 'ARE', 'features', 'were', 'still', 'are', 'wonderful', 'bonus', 'gift', 'world', 'entertainment', 'sameness', 'Sure', 'series', 'more', 'deserving', 'study', 'documentation', 'one', 'episodes', 'stand', 'alone', 'supreme', 'quality', 'product', 'Extras', 'would', 'be', 'greatly', 'appreciated', 'are', 'not', 'necessary', 'MISSION', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'DVD', 'indeed', 'awesome', 'super-cool', 'long-awaited', 'much', 'anticipated', 'revealing', 'long-lost', 'holy', 'grail.Good', 'luck', 'viewer']",Mission: Impossible - The Complete First TV Season
1017062,A35JCTYQGSO6CT,B000HWZ4HU,"W. McRae ""woohooboy""","[2, 3]","The year was 1966. The Cold War was heating up and the Spy Craze was becoming a global phenomenon. Thanks in large part to the James Bond feature films starring Sean Connery and hit tv shows like ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E"", ""I Spy"", ""The Wild Wild West"" & ""The Avengers"". Not surprisingly, another take on the spy genre was about to be unveiled.Created by Bruce Geller, ""Mission: Impossible"" would follow the exploits of a top-secret team of highly trained spies who weekly assignments took them all over the world fighting the forces of evil, wherever it lay. Geller was keen to emphasise the nail-biting situations his characters would often find themselves in and how they would achieve ""the impossible"".From this, he would structure a simple but effective format. The beginning of each episode would commence with the show's team leader arriving at various different locales to receive his assignment in the form of tape players, reels of film, vinyl recordings, projection screens etc. An anonymous voice would greet him and outline what his pending mission would involve. At the end, the voice would offer the man the option to accept the assignment (which of course, he always did!) and would then shortly thereafter self-destruct either by a puff of smoke or by other means.The action would then shift back to the team leader's apartment where he would sift through a dossier that contained the profiles of a number of agents. From there, he would hand pick his team. Afterwards a briefing scene would unfold with snippets of the assignment being discussed amongst the team and what steps would be implemented during the mission. Then it was straight into the thick of the action.Unlike some of it contemporaries such as ""U.N.C.L.E"" & ""Wild Wild West"" which relied on strong doses of humour and over-the-top scenarios, Bruce Geller was determine to kept things understated. Character development was kept to a minimum (you never really knew about the personal lives of the show's characters since you almost always saw them in a professional capacity - and more often than not, they were undercover playing other people). Electronic devices and gadgetry which was to become a staple within the series were used as realistically as possible.Casting was underway and eventually, the show's line-up was selected. Steven Hill was chosen to play the role of Dan Briggs, head of the IMF team. Briggs was an enigma. Low-key in demeanour and tone, he was a thinker who allowed others to play a central role in the plans that he created. Smart and decisive, he generally never allowed himself to become too emotionally involved with his fellow team members and often kept his distance - even sometimes not participating in the assignment altogether.Barbara Bain (in a role that would ultimately see her win her three consecutive Emmys for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series) was selected to play the part of Cinnamon Carter - the bright and attractive female member of the team who would often use her feminine charms and wiles to lure unsuspecting targets off-balance. Smart and capable, Cinnamon was more than just a pretty face. Greg Morris was chosen to play electronics expert Barney Collier. Second behind Bill Cosby on ""I Spy"", Morris was able to blend seamlessly into the show at a time when African-American actors were seldom seen on television. Intelligent and quick-thinking, Barney proved to be an invaluable member of the IMF team. Former competitive body-builder Peter Lupus rounded out the show's cast when he was signed on to play Willy Armitage, the team's strongman who also provided the muscle when the group got themselves into a spot of bother.Bruce Geller also made the decision to cast Martin Landau (who was married to Barbara Bain at the time) in the capacity of a ""guest-star"" during the show's first season, to play the character of Rollin Hand - the team's master of disguise. Rollin was able to take on the look of anyone he was impersonating (due to the masks that he would create - another Mission staple) as well as replicating their voice as well. Landau was an inspired choice and would soon proved to be a major player in the show's success eventually becoming a regular cast member from season two onwards.The first season is an interesting mix of stories that runs a wide gambit. From undermining dictatorships (""Pilot"", ""Odds on Evil"", ""& ""The Diamond""), to taking down American gangsters (""The Ransom"" & ""The Frame) to tackling schemes regarding the Nazi's return to power (""The Legacy"" & ""The Legend""). Still trying to establish its own identity, many of these episodes are infused with moments of personal interaction amongst the team - something that would be scaled back as the series progressed.Right from the outset, ""Mission: Impossible"" established it's unique indenity on the television landscape. With strong story-telling, solid production values, tight editing and of course one of the greatest theme songs ever created - courtesy of Lalo Schifrin - the series would eventually finds it's place in pop culture. The first season is an interesting and enjoyable romp worth checking out. The series would undergo a major casting change by the time it returned for it's second season and aspects of the show's format would be refined and honed as well.
