This episode covers this question and does a pretty good job.There is a fair amount of action and the suspense is well done. The conflict between Scotty and the none-too-bright diplomat is especially well handled. This is one of Scotty's best command assignments. He runs the Enterprise with intelligence and restraint.Kirk's solution to the episode's problem is very suspect in light of the prime directive that he's supposed to be following, but over-all, this is a very good episode.",4,Good Episode on the Nature of War,997660800,"08 13, 2001",2001,581,"['What', 'war', 'were', 'fought', 'computers', 'casualties', 'reported', 'disintegration', 'chambers', 'episode', 'question', 'pretty', 'good', 'job.There', 'fair', 'amount', 'action', 'suspense', 'well', 'done', 'conflict', 'Scotty', 'none-too-bright', 'diplomat', 'especially', 'well', 'handled', 'one', 'Scotty', 'best', 'command', 'assignments', 'Enterprise', 'intelligence', 'restraint.Kirk', 'solution', 'episode', 'problem', 'very', 'suspect', 'light', 'prime', 'directive', 'supposed', 'be', 'following', 'over-all', 'very', 'good', 'episode']","Star Trek - The Original Series, Episode 23: A Taste of Armageddon VHS"
207805,A1S3C5OFU508P3,6300213277,Charles Ashbacher,"[1, 1]","What would happen if war were made deadly, yet clean? If the only damage to society was the loss of people? This question was raised during the presidency of Jimmy Carter, when there was discussion of the neutron or enhanced radiation bomb. It is a weapon that kills living creatures, but does not destroy the physical infrastructure. The neutron bomb was widely ridiculed, considered immoral by the many critics, the point of jokes by late night talk show hosts and production was cancelled.In this episode, two societies (Eminiar and Vendikar) have made the ""rational"" decision to conduct a deadly, but non-destructive war. The battles are fought by computers, with simulated fusion bombs being ""materialized"" over each other's cities. The casualties are computed and the people ""killed"" in the attacks dutifully report to disintegration chambers. This way each society is saved from the disease, filth and brutish nature of the war. The computers of both sides are in constant contact, so both sides are aware of the actions of the other. If either side is lax in their quota of casualties, then escalation into a real war is automatic.For decades, the two societies have warned Federation ships to stay away, but Kirk is ordered to transport Federation Ambassador Fox to Eminiar so that diplomatic relations can be established. Their orders are to violate the wishes of the two societies and essentially force the establishment of friendly relations. When they arrive, Kirk, Spock and a small party of security people beam down to Eminiar. Their treatment upon arrival is very cordial, and they are escorted to the chamber of the ruling council. However, once they arrive, Vendikar launches an attack and the Enterprise is declared destroyed. Since Kirk refuses to allow his crew to beam down to be killed, the Enterprise landing party is taken hostage and the armed forces of Eminiar try to destroy the Enterprise.Kirk manages to get a message to the Enterprise, where he orders Scotty to implement general order 24, which means that the Enterprise is to destroy all of the major cities on the surface. The landing party then proceeds to destroy some disintegration stations, and eventually the computers that correlate the Eminiar attack and defenses. This forces the rulers of Eminiar and Vendikar to talk about peace and finally end the war. Kirk argues at the end that they had made their war too neat, that to end it, they had to face the real threat of the destruction of their societies. He also points out that they have been killing millions a year and a real attack would not have killed any more.In an age of thermonuclear devices, the evolution of such a society is not as absurd as it may appear. For decades, two superpowers deliberately targeted nuclear weapons at each other's cities, under the doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction or MAD. Societies have long accepted the deaths of their soldiers in battle, and there are many indications that war is an inherent part of the human condition, so a combination of these principles could lead to some form of perpetual, clean war. The degree of civilization that would lead to such a situation would also mean that the imposition of a truce by an exterior force would be as easy as is depicted in this episode.I also contrast the reaction of Anon VII, the leader of Eminiar with that of Kirk in ""Errand of Mercy."" In that episode, the Organians intervene to end a war between the Federation and the Klingons. Kirk is furious, arguing that they had no right to interfere and end the war. By contrast Anon is not angry, just concerned about what will happen next.While this episode demonstrates an unusual social order, which raises the quality, there are also two disturbing traits. The first is the Federation attempting to force a planet to open relations and become a spaceport. This is a return to the gunboat diplomacy that existed on Earth and that led to colonization and domination. Commodore Perry forced the Japanese to open their society and shortly after that, Japan launched a decades-long plan of aggressive war and eventually attacked the country that forced the opening. The second is that Kirk would order the destruction of the planet. While the Federation no doubt badly wanted the planet as a spaceport, destroying it to achieve that goal is hardly what Star Fleet command had in mind. It reminded me of the old Vietnam adage, ""We had to bomb the village in order to save it."" For these reasons, I can only give the episode four stars.",4,The Federation imposes its will on another society,1107820800,"02 8, 2005",2005,4525,"['What', 'would', 'happen', 'war', 'were', 'made', 'deadly', 'yet', 'clean', 'only', 'damage', 'society', 'was', 'loss', 'people', 'question', 'was', 'raised', 'presidency', 'Jimmy', 'Carter', 'when', 'was', 'discussion', 'neutron', 'enhanced', 'radiation', 'bomb', 'weapon', 'living', 'creatures', 'not', 'destroy', 'physical', 'infrastructure', 'neutron', 'bomb', 'was', 'widely', 'ridiculed', 'considered', 'immoral', 'many', 'critics', 'point', 'jokes', 'late', 'night', 'talk', 'show', 'hosts', 'production', 'was', 'cancelled.In', 'episode', 'two', 'societies', 'Eminiar', 'Vendikar', 'have', 'made', 'rational', 'decision', 'conduct', 'deadly', 'non-destructive', 'war', 'battles', 'are', 'fought', 'computers', 'simulated', 'fusion', 'bombs', 'being', 'materialized', 'other', 'cities', 'casualties', 'are', 'computed', 'people', 'killed', 'attacks', 'dutifully', 'report', 'disintegration', 'chambers', 'way', 'society', 'saved', 'disease', 'filth', 'brutish', 'nature', 'war', 'computers', 'sides', 'are', 'constant', 'contact', 'sides', 'are', 'aware', 'actions', 'other', 'side', 'lax', 'quota', 'casualties', 'then', 'escalation', 'real', 'war', 'automatic.For', 'decades', 'two', 'societies', 'have', 'warned', 'Federation', 'ships', 'stay', 'away', 'Kirk', 'ordered', 'transport', 'Federation', 'Ambassador', 'Fox', 'Eminiar', 'diplomatic', 'relations', 'can', 'be', 'established', 'orders', 'are', 'violate', 'wishes', 'two', 'societies', 'essentially', 'force', 'establishment', 'friendly', 'relations', 'When', 'arrive', 'Kirk', 'Spock', 'small', 'party', 'security', 'people', 'beam', 'down', 'Eminiar', 'treatment', 'arrival', 'very', 'cordial', 'are', 'escorted', 'chamber', 'ruling', 'council', 'However', 'once', 'arrive', 'Vendikar', 'attack', 'Enterprise', 'declared', 'destroyed', 'Kirk', 'allow', 'crew', 'beam', 'down', 'be', 'killed', 'Enterprise', 'landing', 'party', 'taken', 'hostage', 'armed', 'forces', 'Eminiar', 'try', 'destroy', 'Enterprise.Kirk', 'get', 'message', 'Enterprise', 'where', 'orders', 'Scotty', 'implement', 'general', 'order', '24', 'Enterprise', 'destroy', 'major', 'cities', 'surface', 'landing', 'party', 'then', 'destroy', 'disintegration', 'stations', 'eventually', 'computers', 'correlate', 'Eminiar', 'attack', 'defenses', 'rulers', 'Eminiar', 'Vendikar', 'talk', 'peace', 'finally', 'end', 'war', 'Kirk', 'end', 'had', 'made', 'war', 'too', 'neat', 'end', 'had', 'face', 'real', 'threat', 'destruction', 'societies', 'also', 'out', 'have', 'been', 'killing', 'millions', 'year', 'real', 'attack', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'killed', 'more.In', 'age', 'thermonuclear', 'devices', 'evolution', 'such', 'society', 'not', 'as', 'absurd', 'may', 'appear', 'decades', 'two', 'superpowers', 'deliberately', 'targeted', 'nuclear', 'weapons', 'other', 'cities', 'doctrine', 'Mutual', 'Assured', 'Destruction', 'MAD', 'Societies', 'have', 'long', 'accepted', 'deaths', 'soldiers', 'battle', 'are', 'many', 'indications', 'war', 'inherent', 'part', 'human', 'condition', 'combination', 'principles', 'could', 'lead', 'form', 'perpetual', 'clean', 'war', 'degree', 'civilization', 'would', 'lead', 'situation', 'would', 'also', 'mean', 'imposition', 'truce', 'exterior', 'force', 'would', 'be', 'as', 'easy', 'depicted', 'episode.I', 'also', 'contrast', 'reaction', 'Anon', 'VII', 'leader', 'Eminiar', 'Kirk', 'Errand', 'Mercy', 'episode', 'Organians', 'intervene', 'end', 'war', 'Federation', 'Klingons', 'Kirk', 'furious', 'arguing', 'had', 'right', 'interfere', 'end', 'war', 'contrast', 'Anon', 'not', 'angry', 'just', 'concerned', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'episode', 'unusual', 'social', 'order', 'quality', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'disturbing', 'traits', 'first', 'Federation', 'attempting', 'force', 'planet', 'open', 'relations', 'become', 'spaceport', 'return', 'gunboat', 'diplomacy', 'existed', 'Earth', 'led', 'colonization', 'domination', 'Commodore', 'Perry', 'forced', 'Japanese', 'open', 'society', 'shortly', 'Japan', 'launched', 'decades-long', 'plan', 'aggressive', 'war', 'eventually', 'attacked', 'country', 'forced', 'opening', 'second', 'Kirk', 'would', 'order', 'destruction', 'planet', 'Federation', 'doubt', 'badly', 'wanted', 'planet', 'spaceport', 'destroying', 'achieve', 'goal', 'hardly', 'what', 'Star', 'Fleet', 'command', 'had', 'mind', 'reminded', 'old', 'Vietnam', 'adage', 'had', 'bomb', 'village', 'order', 'save', 'reasons', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'episode', 'four', 'stars']","Star Trek - The Original Series, Episode 23: A Taste of Armageddon VHS"

That is what the Enterprise encounters on Eminiar VII in &quot;A Taste of Armageddon,&quot; a planet that has been at war for five centuries but which fails to show the usual signs of destruction.  This is because they have been fighting the war with computers; after such an attack Anan 7, leader of the High Council announces that half a million people were &quot;killed,&quot; and now have to report to disintegration chambers.  Unfortunately the Enterprise, which was warned not to approach the planet, has also been destroyed and Kirk's crew needs to beam down for disintegration.  Of course, Kirk takes exception to this request and decides to remind these people of the true face of war.  As far fetched as this idea might be, you have to remember the idea of the Neutron Bomb, which would kill the people but leave the buildings, a weapon that was ironically considered by some to be more &quot;humane&quot; than your traditional nuclear device.  Kirk's efforts to restore sanity are hampered by the presence of Federation Ambassador Fox, who wants to stick to the traditional diplomatic approaches despite the fact nobody on the planet is impressed at all by such delicacies.  &quot;A Taste of Armageddon&quot; is another, albeit minor example, of Captain Kirk versus the Super Computer plotline that was so prominent in Star Trek's first season.",5,Kirk proves there is no such thing as a clean war,1002931200,"10 13, 2001",2001,1473,"['One', 'fun', 'things', 'science', 'fiction', 'can', 'take', 'things', 'logical', 'extreme', 'conclusions', 'what', 'Enterprise', 'encounters', 'Eminiar', 'VII', 'quot', 'A', 'Taste', 'Armageddon', 'quot', 'planet', 'been', 'war', 'five', 'centuries', 'show', 'usual', 'signs', 'destruction', 'have', 'been', 'fighting', 'war', 'computers', 'attack', 'Anan', '7', 'leader', 'High', 'Council', 'million', 'people', 'were', 'quot', 'killed', 'quot', 'now', 'have', 'report', 'disintegration', 'chambers', 'Unfortunately', 'Enterprise', 'was', 'warned', 'not', 'approach', 'planet', 'also', 'been', 'destroyed', 'Kirk', 'crew', 'beam', 'down', 'disintegration', 'course', 'Kirk', 'exception', 'request', 'decides', 'remind', 'people', 'true', 'face', 'war', 'far', 'fetched', 'idea', 'might', 'be', 'have', 'remember', 'idea', 'Neutron', 'Bomb', 'would', 'kill', 'people', 'leave', 'buildings', 'weapon', 'was', 'ironically', 'considered', 'be', 'more', 'quot', 'humane', 'quot', 'traditional', 'nuclear', 'device', 'Kirk', 'efforts', 'restore', 'sanity', 'are', 'hampered', 'presence', 'Federation', 'Ambassador', 'Fox', 'who', 'stick', 'traditional', 'diplomatic', 'approaches', 'fact', 'nobody', 'planet', 'impressed', 'such', 'delicacies', 'quot', 'A', 'Taste', 'Armageddon', 'quot', 'minor', 'example', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'Super', 'Computer', 'plotline', 'was', 'so', 'prominent', 'Star', 'Trek', 'first', 'season']","Star Trek - The Original Series, Episode 23: A Taste of Armageddon VHS"
