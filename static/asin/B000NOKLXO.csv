1059497,A36N93O6F0WJ6E,B000NOKLXO,C.C.N.,"[5, 8]","Bellydance Basic is a nice starter for a new dancer and is GREAT for practice! Princess Farhana's technique and fun persona will really inspire you to dance. I have been studying and dancing for several years now, and I still find myself refering back and practicing with this DVD for fun.This DVD covers posture, a brief warm-up, arm positions, basic hip movements, traveling, basic shimmy, figure eights, undulations, arms and hand technique, arm and hand technique with shimmy, and a snappy performance that includes a cute drum solo.Throughout the instruction she gives clear visuals that are easy to understand, and then shows you how to perform the movement so it looks flawless and graceful. She also includes how to present each move with arm positions. (I had taken classes where they did'nt even do that). The way she structures the exercises on this DVD, help prepare the beginning dancer for the more advanced movements you will learn later on.The lighting, camera work, and sound are good. Although, there are points, you can hear a slight sound of cars driving by in the very beginning of the dvd, it's not distracting, or noticeable throughout.If you are looking for a fun, beginner level bellydance DVD to supplement your at home practice or if you are new and want to get your feet wet, I think you will enjoy this one.NOTE: Belly Dance Basics is structured more like an actual bellydance class, you will get excercise but I would not really call it a ""workout.""",5,Great Beginner/Practice Bellydance DVD,1204070400,"02 27, 2008",2008,1479,"['Bellydance', 'Basic', 'nice', 'starter', 'new', 'dancer', 'GREAT', 'practice', 'Princess', 'Farhana', 'technique', 'fun', 'persona', 'will', 'really', 'inspire', 'dance', 'have', 'been', 'studying', 'dancing', 'several', 'years', 'now', 'still', 'find', 'refering', 'back', 'practicing', 'DVD', 'fun.This', 'DVD', 'covers', 'posture', 'brief', 'warm-up', 'arm', 'positions', 'basic', 'hip', 'movements', 'traveling', 'basic', 'shimmy', 'figure', 'eights', 'undulations', 'arms', 'hand', 'technique', 'arm', 'hand', 'technique', 'shimmy', 'snappy', 'performance', 'cute', 'drum', 'instruction', 'clear', 'visuals', 'are', 'easy', 'understand', 'then', 'how', 'perform', 'movement', 'flawless', 'graceful', 'also', 'how', 'present', 'move', 'arm', 'positions', 'had', 'taken', 'classes', 'where', ""did'nt"", 'even', 'do', 'way', 'exercises', 'DVD', 'help', 'prepare', 'beginning', 'dancer', 'more', 'advanced', 'movements', 'will', 'learn', 'later', 'on.The', 'lighting', 'camera', 'work', 'sound', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'points', 'can', 'hear', 'slight', 'sound', 'cars', 'driving', 'very', 'beginning', 'dvd', 'not', 'distracting', 'noticeable', 'throughout.If', 'are', 'looking', 'fun', 'beginner', 'level', 'bellydance', 'DVD', 'supplement', 'home', 'practice', 'are', 'new', 'want', 'get', 'feet', 'wet', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'one.NOTE', 'Belly', 'Dance', 'Basics', 'structured', 'more', 'actual', 'bellydance', 'class', 'will', 'get', 'excercise', 'would', 'not', 'really', 'call', 'workout']",Princess Farhana: Belly Dance Basic Workout

I guess those sales people really do know how eye appeal sells!  First off, this lady is TOUGH! Tough, as in her demeaner, someone you wouldn't want to make mad at you!  Her beautiful photo on the cover was totally different than the tough girl from the streets that I was so glad that wouldn't want to run into an alley.  (sorry, but I'm trying to be truthful).  Her  personality must have came from her pauper who lives in the dungeon!  I have bellydanced for some time, off and on, but have never seen such a terrible tape, the organization, the hesitation in her 'what do I do' to show the steps, which often she didn't!  I don't like bad reviews, but this was real bad!  I haven't seen the second tape that came with the second one that yes, I bought her double DVD set.  I beter stop, as I don't have any more to say.  O.K., one more thing, I have been seeing a chiropracter and masseuse, to help my muscles, yet, with her workout, I have to look up at the t.v. so much, I torked my neck and through out my back by trying to watch, since she gave no instructions.

1059499,A7U9GG09POJ02,B000NOKLXO,Erin,"[7, 10]","The pretty cover is a total dupe! Inside the video is the EXACT opposite. Lord almighty, this is the ugliest bellydance video I've seen in 15 years.Looks like it was shot in a 1930's catholic school gym with a dirty, old and stained, hardwood floor. Behind Farhara dressed in basic black (no princess accroutments evident...she looks less glamourous than a soccer mom) hang dragging-floor-to-ceiling tattered blue satin curtains of the gaudiest color, making your eyes beg for relief. I don`t know what those curtains are hiding but I kept expecting basketballs from the junior high team no doubt playing behind her, to come flying in.Farhana herself is not a terrible dancer persay - but lets face it, bellydance for all it's technique and work is not rocket science, but a dance whose technique is constantly under interpretion, unlike, say ballet, so tho I would not classify her as `bad`, she`s no inspiring swan song either. Her technique is sloppy and ungainly as far as a teacher goes. She's good-natured enough but does not have the polish of a professional educator and I felt ripped off by this two-bit, pathetic production and frankly was flat out angry I`d wasted my money.The audio is terrible! The echo of her voice in the empty room is unforgivable. The cover leads one to believe a romanitic almost princess-like class awaits - or at the very least, a dvd with some composure and class, but alas it is not so. Save your cash and buy almost any other bellydance video. Best of luck in the future, Farhara, and blessings to you, but this video is just not worth the purchase.If you want to see the total opposite in style, panache, and sophistication, purchase `Luscious - The Bellydance Workout for Beginners (2008)` - it is gorgeous and smart and gives you the experience you were probably looking for in Princess Farhara`s instruction and production distaster of a dvd.

1059501,A8A6QIW6PG508,B000NOKLXO,ND,"[3, 3]","I am a beginner, taking bellydance classes. When I bought this DVD, I was'nt sure what to expect (some of the reviews seemed less than stellar). But after working with it, I am glad I got it. The instructor teaches everything well and has a fun personality. This DVD covers almost everything we do in bellydance classes- like basic dance posture, some of the hip movements (like hips drops-up & down, hip circles, figure 8's), undulations, the shimmy.I really liked the way she taught the hand and arm movements. They were very graceful and she showed you how to pair them with your hip movements. I can see with a little practice that I will eventually be able to achieve that look for myself. It was also great to have get another ""take"" on the bellydance moves. I was having trouble understanding a few of the moves in class, and was'nt able to perform them very well. The way she taught them really clicked with me  and I finally ""got"" it. She also covers some traveling combinations, that look more advanced but were do-able for me as a beginner. She is also constant about your posture, (very helpful for me) and how to maintain it though each movement. She includes what ""not"" to do, as well as, lots of repetition of the correct movement.Some mentioned, Jenna's ""Bellydance Basics & Beyond."" I have this one too, and it is very good, a bit better production and covers all the bellydance basics. But I am glad I did'nt pass Princess Farhana's up, based on that. I found she has some different methods of teaching that worked better for me, as well as, some different material (traveling combinations, history, hand technique, etc.) that is not covered on the other. Over the last few weeks, I find I like rotating between the two beacuse they both have alot of great information.I would not say Princess Farhana's ""Bellydance Basic Workout""  is the definitive of beginner bellydance dvds, but it does have alot of good material & technique that is valuable for the beginner studying bellydance. It probably won't satisfy those looking for a serious workout, (like Kathy Smith's-areobics styled with a few bellydance moves), because the material is really like a class, to actually learn bellydance technique. The title is misleading.I would recommend it to any beginner bellydancer that wants to work on technique and broaden your learning.",5,Good Bellydance DVD- Not Sure Why All the Negative?,1333670400,"04 6, 2012",2012,2348,"['am', 'beginner', 'taking', 'bellydance', 'classes', 'When', 'bought', 'DVD', ""was'nt"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'reviews', 'seemed', 'less', 'stellar', 'working', 'am', 'glad', 'got', 'instructor', 'everything', 'well', 'fun', 'personality', 'DVD', 'almost', 'everything', 'do', 'bellydance', 'classes-', 'basic', 'dance', 'posture', 'hip', 'movements', 'hips', 'drops-up', 'down', 'hip', 'circles', 'figure', '8', 'undulations', 'shimmy.I', 'really', 'liked', 'way', 'taught', 'hand', 'arm', 'movements', 'were', 'very', 'graceful', 'showed', 'how', 'pair', 'hip', 'movements', 'can', 'see', 'little', 'practice', 'will', 'eventually', 'be', 'able', 'achieve', 'look', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'have', 'get', 'take', 'bellydance', 'moves', 'was', 'having', 'trouble', 'understanding', 'few', 'moves', 'class', 'able', 'perform', 'very', 'well', 'way', 'taught', 'really', 'clicked', 'finally', 'got', 'also', 'traveling', 'combinations', 'look', 'more', 'advanced', 'were', 'do-able', 'beginner', 'also', 'constant', 'posture', 'very', 'helpful', 'how', 'maintain', 'movement', 'what', 'not', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'lots', 'repetition', 'correct', 'movement.Some', 'mentioned', 'Jenna', 'Bellydance', 'Basics', 'Beyond', 'have', 'one', 'too', 'very', 'good', 'bit', 'better', 'production', 'bellydance', 'basics', 'am', 'glad', ""did'nt"", 'pass', 'Princess', 'Farhana', 'up', 'based', 'found', 'different', 'methods', 'teaching', 'worked', 'better', 'as', 'well', 'different', 'material', 'traveling', 'combinations', 'history', 'hand', 'technique', 'etc', 'not', 'covered', 'other', 'last', 'few', 'weeks', 'find', 'rotating', 'two', 'beacuse', 'have', 'alot', 'great', 'information.I', 'would', 'not', 'say', 'Princess', 'Farhana', 'Bellydance', 'Basic', 'Workout', 'definitive', 'beginner', 'bellydance', 'dvds', 'have', 'alot', 'good', 'material', 'technique', 'valuable', 'beginner', 'studying', 'bellydance', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'satisfy', 'looking', 'serious', 'workout', 'Kathy', ""Smith's-areobics"", 'styled', 'few', 'bellydance', 'moves', 'material', 'really', 'class', 'actually', 'learn', 'bellydance', 'technique', 'title', 'misleading.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'beginner', 'bellydancer', 'work', 'technique', 'broaden', 'learning']",Princess Farhana: Belly Dance Basic Workout
