I grew up in the Bronx, New York and watched this show every day. Carole and Paula were a beautiful, calming and educational presence in my childhood. It's too bad that kids nowadays need endless stimulation, sarcastic cartoons, video games and cellphones to be entertained. ""The Magic Garden"" takes me back to a much simpler time. I loved the lengthy segment on creative things to do with plain old boxes. It reminds me how kids like myself used our imaginations in a useful and fun way.Thank goodness for DVD.

Unlike many other childrens' shows which do not live up to their beloved memories, The Magic Garden does not disappoint, even almost 40 years after its initial release. Carol and Paula both have amazing chemistry due to their long time real-life friendship, something that cannot be duplicated by throwing two people into a show together. Great stories, wonderful songs, and two ladies, who are as nice as they are talented, still manage to keep today's kids glued to the TV set.

Some 37 years ago she recited the jokes and sang the songs, and we even bought her the record album.  My husband took one look at the DVD set when it came and asked, ""Are you sure this isn't for Rachel (our daughter)?""  I sort of wondered myself which one I was buying it for.  However, we watched our granddaughter a week later, and she was reciting jokes from the Chuckle Patch, singing songs, and telling us about Sherlock the puppet.  She said she watches the DVD every night before she goes to sleep.  We surprised her when we showed her the album her mother played to death as a little girl.  And the album cover is the real treasure.  It was left uncolored by the manufacturer so little ones could color it in themselves.  We showed our granddaughter the album cover her mother had colored, and then we played the record for her - and listened as she sang along.",5,FOR A NEW GENERATION,1231372800,"01 8, 2009",2009,1015,"['ordered', 'almost', 'five-year-old', 'granddaughter', 'Christmas', 'knew', 'daughter', 'had', 'loved', 'Carole', 'Paula', 'when', 'was', 'seven', '37', 'years', 'ago', 'recited', 'jokes', 'sang', 'songs', 'even', 'bought', 'record', 'album', 'husband', 'took', 'one', 'look', 'DVD', 'set', 'when', 'came', 'asked', 'Are', 'sure', ""n't"", 'Rachel', 'daughter', 'sort', 'wondered', 'one', 'was', 'buying', 'However', 'watched', 'granddaughter', 'week', 'later', 'was', 'reciting', 'jokes', 'Chuckle', 'Patch', 'singing', 'songs', 'telling', 'Sherlock', 'puppet', 'said', 'DVD', 'night', 'sleep', 'surprised', 'when', 'showed', 'album', 'mother', 'played', 'death', 'little', 'girl', 'album', 'cover', 'real', 'treasure', 'was', 'left', 'uncolored', 'manufacturer', 'so', 'little', 'ones', 'could', 'color', 'showed', 'granddaughter', 'album', 'cover', 'mother', 'had', 'colored', 'then', 'played', 'record', 'listened', 'sang', 'along']",N/A

It was always on around 2 P.M. every day like clockwork. Even during the summer months out of school, I went in to watch Carole and Janis and friends. For a half-hour, they sang songs, told stories, and taught a lesson. I never knew that there were only 52 episodes. Unfortunately, there are only 10 here. I always thought there had to be hundreds and I probably saw them a dozen times. Thirty years later, I kind of yearn for that period of life when my worry was missing the Magic Garden.
