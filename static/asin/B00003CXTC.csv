536901,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00003CXTC,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[7, 10]","Rollerball.  In the original film, the game attempted to stand as an outlet of Corporation superiority; constantly demonstrating to the consumers (the people) that individuality is futile.  Apparently, one does not have to either read the screenplay or physically watch the original film for there to be a remake.  Decent director John McTiernan, who ""wow-ed"" me with such films as the remake of The Thomas Crown Affair as well as his early cult hits like Die Hard and Predator has obviously lost his ability to either A) do remakes or B) handle a camera with any sense of decency.  If I was allowed one question to have answered through the course of my life, my question would be, ""What was the point of Rollerball the remake?"", and I do believe there would be answer from any higher authority.  This film single handedly goes down in the record books as not just the worst remake to come out of Hollywood, but it is also a double threat, with it being in the top 100 of worst films ever conceived.  It is embarrassing to say, but it has to be said, that Rollerball is one of a few select films that demonstrated no ability in the fields of direction, acting, cinematography, or writing.  If Rollerball were deemed a student paper, it would have failed all four parts.  Nothing, I repeat, nothing of value can be found with this film, and I even tried hard, but one must easily look at this film and simply state, ""It failed"".As I look at the description for this film through many web sites, I happen to notice that many times this film is classified as a ""science fiction"" film, which boggles my mind.  There was absolutely nothing science fiction about this film outside of the possibility of the actual Rollerball game being a rather sci-fi-esque type game, but when you look at it, there is nothing special about the sport.  The 1975 film version was extremely science fiction with its views on the future of our world, the surrounding environment, as well as subtly placed usage of the laser gun.  Yet somehow, this 2002 version is able to call itself a ""science fiction"" merely on the premise that it takes place three years in the future.  Three. Whole. Years.  That to me is the staple of why this film corrupted from the inside out.  The writing was atrocious to say the least.  It felt as if the writers of this film, one Larry Ferguson or one John Pogue (odd, this horrid smelling filth of a film took two of Hollywood's scribes ... ouchers!), took random ideas, threw them together and attempted to create continuity in the course of 97 minutes.  No doubtably procrastination was an issue, and to cut corners to meet a deadline these avid writers chose to cut characters, huge plot points, and any sort of solid stream of consciousness to create possibly the worst that Hollywood could ever offer.  Nothing, in the form of script, plot, or action/adventure is worth mentioning in this film.  I had difficulty enjoying the first one and it was a symbolic mess about the corporate hold on its consumers, while this filth had nothing to do with ... nothing.  Words came out of the actor's mouths, but they meant nothing, they stood for nothing, and half the time it just had me laughing due to the staged words that they were dealt.  Again, there was no value in this film.Chris Klein has ridden the shirt tales of American Pie for a very long time (I always saw him as the Weakest Link of those films), so he decided to take a leading man's role in Rollerball in hopes that he could transform his career into a leading man, but you can't make cardboard stand on his own.  Could Chris have attempted to grow a backbone for this film ... is that possible?  The words that came out of his mouth had no emotion; he was together with Rebecca Romijn-Stamos for purely the physical admiration, and someone needs to tell him that by squinting his eyes harder doesn't indicate that he is upset or angry.  I cannot seem to shake the image of him riding with L.L. Cool J in the Russian night on a motorcycle using ""night vision"" for dramatic purposes, and Klein speaking unattached words out of my mind.  It was hilarity on a grand scale.  I remember the pair talking about something, but the laughter coming from my mouth was far more overpowering.  Nothing (which seems to be the common theme of this film) is of value in this film.  Klein proved that on more than one occasion.  That isn't to say that those like LL, Jean Reno, Stamos, or even my favorite Naveen Andrews were any better.  Klein led the pact with kindergarten acting skills, but Reno was completely over the top, which caused confusion as to who he was and why he was involved financially, Andrews was nothing more than filler, Stamos was used for the nudity ... that was all, and LL kept the ""hip-ness"" factor on a grander scale.  Nobody demonstrated anything close to talent in this film and it ultimately boils down to the failure of decent director John McTiernan.Rollerball is one of those films that gives remakes a horrid name.  Even if the original wasn't worth writing home to mother about, films of this stature only place a black scar on the future of remakes.  I have to be worried about McTiernan because of my enjoyment of some of his past films and how anyone could see the final cut of this film and say, ""This is my best work yet!""  If you cannot say those words as you hand the final reel to the distribution company, I would reconsider the release.  Writing was far worse that imaginable, the acting was nowhere to be seen, and the cinematography (something I didn't feel like going into too deeply with this review) felt as if it was done by those who are afraid of camera.  Honestly, I have seen better amateur work than what Rollerball had to offer.  Why is this film still being distributed?  This is a very dark cloud amongst the Hollywood types and am very surprised to see that everyone is still able to acquire roles in Tinsel town after this disaster.  My only wish is that future directors and actors actually take pride in their work instead of just allowing the paycheck to do the talking.  Ignore this film or it will haunt you the rest of your life!Grade: * out of *****",1,What channel did you say you gave us in your territory?,1160438400,"10 10, 2006",2006,6174,"['original', 'film',

Based in central Asia, the game becomes increasingly violent to boost TV ratings - especially in America - and to make for  growing fan interest.It takes the anticorporate stance of Jonathon E and morphs him into outlaw exteme sports lover Jonathon Cross (Chris Klein), who ultimately leads the players and fans in a revolt against the senseless violence pushed by sport founder Alexi Petrovich (Jean Reno) and the networks. Sounds like a bad WWE storyline, and that may be why motormouth Paul Heyman is the ""announcer"" for the games. I was waiting for Heyman to belt out, ""It's Extreme,"" several hundred times.Put LL Cool J, who plays an old friend of Cross and the person who gets him involved in the game, in the lead role and he may have saved the character from being absolutely unbelievebale.

The bloodlust that was in the fictional future's rollerball audience was only slightly little different from the real life demands young white men were making at that time of the then emerging sport of Ice Hockey.The age of the Nation-State was over and the multinational corporation, who was the new totalitarian aggroprop motivator, was now ascendent. We no longer had to worry about ideologues but PR men telling you what, when and where to buy. Control through the supply and demand for consumer goods and pastimes.Humankind still had an aggression complex: a need for one man to hurt -and yes even kill!- his fellow man. How does the Multinational Global Corporations contain, yet satisfy, this bloodlust (and at the same time further stupify an already flabby, dumbed-down populace)? ROLLERBALL. All the fastpaced, adrenaline inducing, death and maiming and scarring of WAR, shrunken down and sealed up into a tiny arena, starting and ending at precise times.Sad. Hateful. However, like all those aforementioned movies did, showing a reflection of us: Modern, secular, selfish, self-gratifying Humanity.2002's &quot;Rollerball&quot; instead of updating and furthering this warning/message, is rather just another example and prop of our malaise as a immature, gratification addicted species. No true message. Just bright lights, loud noise, hitech special effects and shallowness. The writers and artists have become just as negative and selfish as the lumpen.It is because of movies such as this that I was putoff when I heard that there was talk of making remakes of &quot;Logan's Run&quot; and &quot;Omega Man&quot;. When the respective stars being considered for these intended remakes are Leonardo Di Caprio and Arnold Schwartzenneger I easily imagine Hollywood rendering these beloved classics into meaningless, mindless action/thriller schlock and junk. All shoot-em-ups, chases, and silly  countdowns to explosive fireworks. Leaving no commitment or involvement from the theatre audience but laughter and cheers. No reflections. No introspections. No learning. No morality.Hollywood, please leave the films of a better, more compassionate, more intelligent era alone. You can satisfy the mob you pander to without remakes. Thin plots, involving one-dimensional characters, speeding through long scenes of T&amp;A, mindless violence and numbing special effects will more than satisfy your market and bring in all the revenue you lust for.

It's not really fair to call this a remake of the 1975 version, which is good in its own rights.  This takes the basic premise of the Rollerball game, but instead of being set in some futuristic sci-fi world, it places the game in our current time.  Now that the Soviet Union has broken up into independent countries, men who were powerful under the Soviet government still seek to remain in power.  Rollerball team owners are incredibly powerful men - men who are not willing to give up the trappings of power.  They use their power with impunity, resorting to extortion, force, threats to accomplish their goals.The pace can become fast and furious.  Much as if this were a real sport, the movie is cut with the style that would be appreciated by afficianados of this sort of sport - similar to the way professional wrestling is marketed.  The fast cuts, choppy action, insertion of elements such as the player's trading cards, persistent music, all help focus on the experience that the Rollerball fans would relish.Chris Klein and L.L. Cool J are two Americans on a team based in Kazakstan (my apologies for any spelling errors).  Their team travels to compete against teams in other Central Asian countries.  When the TV ratings begin to drop, the team owners resort to any means possible to keep the ratings up.  The methods used, in light of the political situation in that area of the world, are entirely plausible and believable.  One should take note of the subtle ways that are used to control the team members.Although younger viewers may enjoy the action scenes and the music, more mature viewers will enjoy those plus the intrigue.

This movie is more about the trouncing of participants in the roller derby sport I used to watch on 1970's television.  So the only things in common between the two films are the name and the fact a ball rolls around a rink in a violent sport.If one can disassociate the first film from this one, then this version can actually be fun.  In a brief synopsis, the star rollerballer in a central asian ring discovers that the league ownership is manipulating television ratings by staging violent scenes on the rink.  When he and a fellow American (played adequately by LL Cool J) decide to save their own necks by fleeing to the boarder, they are hunted down by the Russian thugs before they can make good their escape.  The inclusion of a Dutch motorcyclist, played by Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, provided the movie with a love interest.The final game is a bit unrealistic as the wounded star, played by Chris Klein who surprisingly looks like a junior Keanu Reeves, stays alive on the rink long enough to confront his opponents in the front office.All in all, better than I expected, as long as I kept in mind it was not the same as the original.",4,Better than Expected,1051920000,"05 3, 2003",2003,1244,"['original', '1975', 'film', 'provoked', 'thought', 'society', 'how', 'mankind', 'chose', 'comfort', 'free', 'choice', 'movie', 'more', 'trouncing', 'participants', 'roller', 'derby', 'sport', 'used', 'watch', '1970', 'television', 'only', 'things', 'common', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'name', 'fact', 'ball', 'rink', 'violent', 'sport.If', 'one', 'can', 'disassociate', 'first', 'film', 'one', 'then', 'version', 'can', 'actually', 'be', 'fun', 'brief', 'synopsis', 'star', 'rollerballer', 'central', 'asian', 'ring', 'discovers', 'league', 'ownership', 'manipulating', 'television', 'ratings', 'staging', 'violent', 'scenes', 'rink', 'When', 'fellow', 'American', 'played', 'adequately', 'LL', 'Cool', 'J', 'decide', 'save', 'own', 'necks', 'fleeing', 'boarder', 'are', 'hunted', 'down', 'Russian', 'thugs', 'can', 'make', 'good', 'escape', 'inclusion', 'Dutch', 'motorcyclist', 'played', 'Rebecca', 'Romijn-Stamos', 'provided', 'movie', 'love', 'interest.The', 'final', 'game', 'bit', 'unrealistic', 'wounded', 'star', 'played', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'who', 'surprisingly', 'junior', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'alive', 'rink', 'long', 'enough', 'confront', 'opponents', 'front', 'office.All', 'better', 'expected', 'as', 'long', 'kept', 'mind', 'was', 'not', 'same', 'original']",Rollerball VHS

536916,A1AKDW4P8V72R4,B00003CXTC,"David C. Anderson ""fenrisbooks""","[4, 6]","One has to ask why anyone would want to remake Rollerball in the first place. Aside from the rather interesting James Caan in the starring role, the flat direction by Norman Jewison and the almost laughable story guaranteed this film a place among the greatest cult films ever. Perhaps the makers of this version mistook its cult status for popularity when they imagined that this remake would appeal to today's audience. As if it was an indication of how the film would do, it was pulled from its original release date and ""retooled"" (Hollywood speak for shelved) before new trailers were made and the film was given a high profile launch earlier this year. It was all for naught, it seems, as this film couldn't be any worse. The DVD version is the R rated cut, giving teen audiences the blood and bare breasts that they missed in the PG-13 theatrical version. The slight glimpses of Rebecca Romjin-Stamos' breasts and some slight gore don't make up for what is ultimately a car wreck of a film, that fails to achieve on any level.Chris Klein stars as Jonathan, the new superstar of Asian supersport Rollerball - the sport of near future kings - a combination of motorcross, Jai A'lai, and roller derby. With a clumsy opening credits sequence wherein an enthusiastic american announcer (played by a guy doing a Rowdy Roddy Piper goes to Pittsburgh accent) explains the rules of the game - we are introduced to our first taste of the sport. That the sport is as chaotic and violent as it is - what with motorcyles and people being hit with metal balls, etc. - it makes one wonder why anyone would bat an eyelash at people being killed during the matches. However, Chris Klein and co. become suspicious when they suspect that fatal accidents are being arranged to help boost ratings (incidentally, in this future a giant scoreboard reports the ratings numbers stock ticker style so the game's owner - played with bored detachment by Jean Reno - can immediately see how these ""accidents"" help boost the ratings. And, in another odd bit of out there movie reasoning - the second something dangerous happens in the game, these numbers jump by hundreds of millions of viewers (how such a fickle fan base manages to tune in at a moments notice is puzzling - but I digress).As a fan of McTiernan's other films (Die Hard, Die Hard With a Vengeance, Predator, and even the Thomas Crown Affair) I expected that no matter how bad the story was, the Rollerball scenes would be well executed enough to hold my interest. After all, we never liked Die Hard for Reginald Vel Johnson - did we? Alas, it seems that John McTiernan saw the futility of the project and gave up long before shooting began. The action scenes are flashy and flat - sacrificing a well built scene in favor of the quick flash of less than impressive effects and stunt laden glitz. Its almost as if Mc Tiernan handed over control of the film to a second unit director itching to get his hands on a real film. Of course blame should be shared by cinematographer Steve Mason, whose camerawork shows that he doesn't have the imagination to shoot make believe sport films (add rollerball to the equally treacherous BASEketball of a few years back), his lensing of many scenes feels made up on the fly - and many times it doesn't work. This is espescially true of a long nighttime chase sequence shot through a green tinted lens that gives the scene the look of being filmed through night vision goggles. Equal parts distracting and headache inducing, it is one of the worst cases of a crime against cinema in recent memory.Not that the actors do much to help the film along. Chris Klein, bless his heart, is so out of place in a film where it is required that he exhibit emotion or act like anyone other than Chris Klein. It's as if the rest of the cast and crew went along with making the film so as not to make him feel bad. I felt like a parent at a 3rd grade school play, watching someone else's kid butcher the production. Suffice it to say that when L.L. Cool J is forced to carry the film - the film is in trouble.Rollerball is bad. It will never be revered as a piece of bad cinema to be enjoyed on the level of Showgirls or even Ernest goes to Jail. Rather, it will eventually find its way to the [price] reduction bin at [local store] - and even then its probably not a good purchase.",1,So bad - its bad,1028764800,"08 8, 2002",2002,4347,"['One', 'ask', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'want', 'remake', 'Rollerball', 'first', 'place', 'Aside', 'rather', 'interesting', 'James', 'Caan', 'starring', 'role', 'flat', 'direction', 'Norman', 'Jewison', 'almost', 'laughable', 'story', 'guaranteed', 'film', 'place', 'greatest', 'cult', 'films', 'ever', 'Perhaps', 'makers', 'version', 'mistook', 'cult', 'status', 'popularity', 'when', 'imagined', 'remake', 'would', 'appeal', 'today', 'audience', 'was', 'indication', 'how', 'film', 'would', 'do', 'was', 'pulled', 'original', 'release', 'date', 'retooled', 'Hollywood', 'speak', 'shelved', 'new', 'trailers', 'were', 'made', 'film', 'was', 'given', 'high', 'profile', 'launch', 'earlier', 'year', 'was', 'naught', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'worse', 'DVD', 'version', 'R', 'rated', 'cut', 'giving', 'teen', 'audiences', 'blood', 'bare', 'breasts', 'missed', 'PG-13', 'theatrical', 'version', 'slight', 'glimpses', 'Rebecca', 'Romjin-Stamos', 'breasts', 'slight', 'gore', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'what', 'ultimately', 'car', 'wreck', 'film', 'achieve', 'level.Chris', 'Klein', 'Jonathan', 'new', 'superstar', 'Asian', 'supersport', 'Rollerball', 'sport', 'near', 'future', 'kings', 'combination', 'motorcross', 'Jai', ""A'lai"", 'roller', 'derby', 'clumsy', 'opening', 'credits', 'sequence', 'wherein', 'enthusiastic', 'american', 'announcer', 'played', 'guy', 'doing', 'Rowdy', 'Roddy', 'Piper', 'Pittsburgh', 'accent', 'rules', 'game', 'are', 'introduced', 'first', 'taste', 'sport', 'sport', 'chaotic', 'violent', 'what', 'motorcyles', 'people', 'being', 'hit', 'metal', 'balls', 'etc', 'one', 'wonder', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'bat', 'eyelash', 'people', 'being', 'killed', 'matches', 'However', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'become', 'suspicious', 'when', 'suspect', 'fatal', 'accidents', 'are', 'being', 'arranged', 'help', 'boost', 'ratings', 'incidentally', 'future', 'giant', 'scoreboard', 'ratings', 'numbers', 'stock', 'ticker', 'style', 'game', 'owner', 'played', 'bored', 'detachment', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'can', 'immediately', 'see', 'how', 'accidents', 'help', 'boost', 'ratings', 'odd', 'bit', 'movie', 'reasoning', 'second', 'something', 'dangerous', 'happens', 'game', 'numbers', 'jump', 'hundreds', 'millions', 'viewers', 'how', 'fickle', 'fan', 'base', 'tune', 'moments', 'notice', 'puzzling', 'digress', '.As', 'fan', 'McTiernan', 'other', 'films', 'Die', 'Hard', 'Die', 'Hard', 'Vengeance', 'Predator', 'even', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'Affair', 'expected', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'story', 'was', 'Rollerball', 'scenes', 'would', 'be', 'well', 'executed', 'enough', 'hold', 'interest', 'never', 'liked', 'Die', 'Hard', 'Reginald', 'Vel', 'Johnson', 'did', 'Alas', 'John', 'McTiernan', 'saw', 'futility', 'project', 'gave', 'up', 'long', 'shooting', 'began', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'flashy', 'flat', 'sacrificing', 'well', 'built', 'scene', 'favor', 'quick', 'flash', 'less', 'impressive', 'effects', 'stunt', 'laden', 'glitz', 'almost', 'Mc', 'Tiernan', 'handed', 'over', 'control', 'film', 'second', 'unit', 'director', 'itching', 'get', 'hands', 'real', 'film', 'course', 'blame', 'should', 'be', 'shared', 'cinematographer', 'Steve', 'Mason', 'camerawork', ""n't"", 'have', 'imagination', 'shoot', 'make', 'believe', 'sport', 'films', 'add', 'rollerball', 'equally', 'treacherous', 'BASEketball', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'lensing', 'many', 'scenes', 'feels', 'made', 'up', 'fly', 'many', 'times', ""n't"", 'work', 'espescially', 'true', 'long', 'nighttime', 'chase', 'sequence', 'shot', 'green', 'tinted', 'lens', 'scene', 'look', 'being', 'filmed', 'night', 'vision', 'goggles', 'Equal', 'parts', 'distracting', 'headache', 'inducing', 'one', 'worst', 'cases', 'crime', 'cinema', 'recent', 'memory.Not', 'actors', 'do', 'much', 'help', 'film', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'bless', 'heart', 'so', 'place', 'film', 'where', 'required', 'emotion', 'act', 'anyone', 'other', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'rest', 'cast', 'crew', 'went', 'making', 'film', 'so', 'not', 'make', 'feel', 'bad', 'felt', 'parent', '3rd', 'grade', 'school', 'play', 'watching', 'someone', 'else', 'kid', 'production', 'Suffice', 'say', 'when', 'L.L', 'Cool', 'J', 'forced', 'carry', 'film', 'film', 'trouble.Rollerball', 'bad', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'revered', 'piece', 'bad', 'cinema', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'level', 'Showgirls', 'even', 'Ernest', 'Jail', 'Rather', 'will', 'eventually', 'find', 'way', '[', 'price', ']', 'reduction', 'bin', '[', 'local', 'store', ']', 'even', 'then', 'probably', 'not', 'good', 'purchase']",Rollerball VHS
536917,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B00003CXTC,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[1, 2]","Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has a fascinating career slump, dating the origins of its downfall for many years.  The company used to be the king of producing movies, or at least it and Warner Bros. saw eye-to-eye, but the trouble began once Ted Turner bought the majority of the MGM library in the mid-1980s.  And then in the mid-90s, MGM started heading down the quality crapper with the release of ""Showgirls"", a movie I personally thought was enjoyable but I had to acknowledge the critical lashing the film had.  From then on, it kept a consistent record of producing below-average movies, with very few non-UA movies worth praising; not even the recent James Bond movies (sans ""Casino Royale"") helped them with their downward slope.  As of now, the once-roaring studio is in financial trouble and in danger of being bankrupt (despite being sold to multiple companies), so what films did it accomplish in recent years?  ""Soul Plane"", ""College"", ""The Mod Squad"", ""Sleep Over"", ""Good Boy"", ""Jiminy Glick in Lalawood"", ""Fame"" remake...and this movie, ""Rollerball"".  What can I say, at least they had ""Barbershop"".I'm on the defense to say this isn'tthe worst of the worst, but if this movie expected for me to accept a dystopian world where corrupt businessmen are using this sport as a global-televised sensation, then it had another thing coming.  It's glorified roller derby, for goodness sake, and the way it was set-up is impractical.  This sport had a pretty small field of play, no bigger than a regular skating rink.  Since many players had to fill in the stage, it would be pretty cluttered to watch and to experience, and this sport is suppose to include skateboarders AND motorcyclists. Do you know how crazy is it to ride a motorcycle in a small area surrounded by other players? There's no way one can drive fast and maneuver around the field without running over the majority of players; although logic like that seem dismissible in this film since one biker manage to run over a player and he didn't get seriously injured.  And what are the rules of this game, besides hitting a metal ball at a goalpost?  The film's final act decided not to have any rules, but I didn't know what the rules were to begin with; the chubby announcer in the film hadn't any idea what to make of this sport either.Even if I'm just humoring the premise, I can't deal with the film taking obnoxious lengths to be edgy.  For this movie to be edgy, every character has to be cocky and insulting each other (this is par for every sport, though),  they have to wear spikes and other ridiculous get-ups (with the girls wearing dominatrix attire),  the largely heavy metal soundtrack had to blast Slipknot and Rob Zombie whenever it can, and there has to be lots of jump cuts whenever the action occurs.  It tried too hard to be extreme that the film reached the point of pretentiousness.And then there's the plot, which has ""The Running Man"" written all over it.  Chris Klein is the lead hot-shot, LL Cool J is the black partner, and Rebecca Romijn is the fanservice; they're part of an elite team of the popular sport, which is controlled by Jean Reno, and once they know how corrupt the sport is, they planned to fight their way out.  The lack of any exposition is what nearly destroyed this movie.  Somehow, everyone knows what's going on and where to go at particular moments without being told, so a lot of events just happened out of change.  There's too many characters and the film didn't bother to establish most of them, and often times it pulled random conveniences out of its edgy behind (i.e., how that one character manages to steal the locker key off of some other character without showing it).The convoluted, inexplicable plot and the obnoxious hardcore attitude about itself made ""Rollerball"" almost unenjoyable.  I say 'almost', because I admit in enjoying the climax of the film, which had some tension and it wasn't boring (plus, I have a thing foruprisingconclusions); plus, the whole desert sequence shot in night-vision was certainly new, if a bit of an odd design choice.

Although I did manage to limp through this cinematic trainwreck in the space of three separate viewings, it is on a par with that trio -- a complete and utter disaster, a piece of filmic shinola that is completely undeserving of your attention.  Lead actor Chris Klein is Keanu lite, pure and simple... And it's all downhill from there, baby.  I seem to recall liking the 1975 James Caan version of this film, which I saw when I was a kid -- but this ""extreme sport"" inspired remake turns the premise on its head, trying to dazzle us with reality-show glitz, even while bluntly, crushingly attempting to recreate the anti-establishment subversiveness of the original.  I should pause here to mention that even this low level of analysis lends this travesty too much creedence -- the script is pathetic, the acting nominal, the cinematography and direction are both quite shabby, and even the sound design is muddled and cluttered. To make things worse, if possible they write in the ""hero"" as a young, untouchable super-stud, rather than an aging jock whose skill and experience are only just barely enough to him fit for this dangerous new game.

Tony Scott's Spy Game was one, but that film at least had the star power of Robert Redford and Brad Pitt to rescue it.  Rollerball, on the other hand, has no redeeming features -- it is easily the worst film in John McTiernan's oeuvre.Which is sad, because McTiernan's resume is an astonishing one:  Predator, Die Hard, Die Hard with a Vengeance, The Hunt for Red October.  Even his worst film up to now, Last Action Hero, was better than the mess that is Rollerball.  From the beginning, it's clear that this film has no interest whatsoever in characterization and pacing.  It simply thrusts you into sequence after sequence of undisciplined chaos.  Who is main character Jonathan Cross?  Who is his buddy?  You still won't have a clue 30 minutes into the film, and that's about 20 minutes too late.  Too much loud music, messy dialogue editing, use of pointless and ugly jump cuts, and hyperactive camera work conspire to make Rollerball an even bigger migraine than Swordfish...and that's saying a lot.  Handheld camera is an overrated device indeed, and in the case of Rollerball, there are so many characters onscreen at a time that you'll find yourself desperately straining to figure out who's saying what, who is the focal point, and what exactly is going on.  The overall feeling is that this film was shot in pure handheld-coverage style, the filmmakers simply mashing all the actors together in a location and then shooting endless amounts of film, without preplanning as to how it would all cut together.  Call this modern filmmaking, but I'd take the razor-precision of Die Hard, Lethal Weapon and Top Gun any day.Matched with the stylistic anarchy is a cast of characters who mostly behave like animals or clowns.  There's not a single recognizable human trait in these characters; their motivations and behaviour are outlandishly cartoonish, without the entertaining factor.What happened?  I believe that action masters like McTiernan and Scott may have been led down this undesireable path by all the young Turks springing up from music-video backgrounds to do features.  Unfortunately, as in the case of Rollerball, Swordfish, Gone in 60 Seconds, The Replacement Killers, this style is a true atrocity to action filmmaking.  I hope Scott, McTiernan and others realize this and stick to their guns, or we can say goodbye to action movies.",1,John McTiernan -- yet another casualty of MTV style.,1024444800,"06 19, 2002",2002,2485,"['Several', 'masters', 'action', 'film', 'have', 'fallen', 'prey', 'undisciplined', 'chaos', 'post-MTV', 'music-video-style', 'editing', 'filmmaking', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'Spy', 'Game', 'was', 'one', 'film', 'least', 'had', 'star', 'power', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'rescue', 'Rollerball', 'other', 'hand', 'redeeming', 'easily', 'worst', 'film', 'John', 'McTiernan', 'oeuvre.Which', 'sad', 'McTiernan', 'resume', 'astonishing', 'one', 'Predator', 'Die', 'Hard', 'Die', 'Hard', 'Vengeance', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'October', 'Even', 'worst', 'film', 'now', 'Last', 'Action', 'Hero', 'was', 'better', 'mess', 'Rollerball', 'beginning', 'clear', 'film', 'interest', 'whatsoever', 'characterization', 'pacing', 'simply', 'sequence', 'sequence', 'undisciplined', 'chaos', 'Who', 'main', 'character', 'Jonathan', 'Cross', 'Who', 'buddy', 'still', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', '30', 'minutes', 'film', '20', 'minutes', 'too', 'late', 'Too', 'much', 'loud', 'music', 'messy', 'dialogue', 'editing', 'use', 'pointless', 'ugly', 'jump', 'cuts', 'hyperactive', 'camera', 'work', 'conspire', 'make', 'even', 'bigger', 'migraine', 'Swordfish', 'saying', 'lot', 'Handheld', 'camera', 'overrated', 'device', 'indeed', 'case', 'Rollerball', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'onscreen', 'time', ""'ll"", 'find', 'desperately', 'straining', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'saying', 'what', 'who', 'focal', 'point', 'what', 'exactly', 'going', 'overall', 'feeling', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'pure', 'handheld-coverage', 'style', 'filmmakers', 'simply', 'mashing', 'actors', 'together', 'location', 'then', 'shooting', 'endless', 'amounts', 'film', 'preplanning', 'how', 'would', 'all', 'cut', 'together', 'Call', 'modern', 'filmmaking', ""'d"", 'take', 'razor-precision', 'Die', 'Hard', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'Top', 'Gun', 'day.Matched', 'stylistic', 'anarchy', 'cast', 'characters', 'who', 'mostly', 'behave', 'like', 'animals', 'clowns', 'not', 'single', 'recognizable', 'human', 'trait', 'characters', 'motivations', 'behaviour', 'are', 'outlandishly', 'cartoonish', 'entertaining', 'factor.What', 'happened', 'believe', 'action', 'masters', 'McTiernan', 'Scott', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'led', 'down', 'undesireable', 'path', 'young', 'Turks', 'springing', 'up', 'music-video', 'backgrounds', 'do', 'features', 'Unfortunately', 'case', 'Rollerball', 'Swordfish', 'Gone', '60', 'Seconds', 'Replacement', 'Killers', 'style', 'true', 'atrocity', 'action', 'filmmaking', 'hope', 'Scott', 'McTiernan', 'others', 'realize', 'stick', 'guns', 'can', 'say', 'goodbye', 'action', 'movies']",Rollerball VHS

One of the most glaring things that I noticed was the poor editing job; there are several instances where it looks like one of those old silent films where one minute a character is one place and another minute a character is another place. It is amazing to find that kind of thing happen these days in movies. Still, I think this movie had some potential. It was a relatively good action movie that used the corruptability of sports and ratings as its main theme. The basic premise is that in order to get ratings powerful sports organizers are willing to do anything, including sometimes brutal accidents, to achieve this. You may choose to look at this as a stab at what we do in America today (such as reality type television), or you may take it to ""glamourize"" this type of action (which I do not think the producers were trying to do). The lack of star power and script really hurts this movie, however. Also, it is overdone with a soundtrack that is seemingly never ending. I would venture to guess that half of the movie has music blaring in it during the action scenes. (It is fine to have a soundtrack, but you do not need to make the music the movie.) Overall, although this was not a good movie, I certainly do not think it was ""the worst"" movie you will ever see.

His film, the second in his career 'remade' from Norman Jewison - after ""Thomas Crown"" - actually uses all the fashioned cliches of American action movies: all the scenes were shot and edited at 100 mph, in the MTV style (the musical background is unstandable). We have the impression to deal with a ""Fast and Furious"" on skates. The story doesn't have any slice of interest, and the too cool acting (especially LL Cool J's - 'Close your eyes and take the dough!') and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos disastrous Russian accent don't arrange anything. But what may be really shocking in this film is the presence of a woman in the games, which is really unacceptable when you see the great violence of this sport, mixing football, baseball, boxing and ice hockey, and where (maybe for the beauty of the show...) almost no blow is forbidden. There is no woman football or ice hockey league (so far...), but you can see a woman playing rollerball... look for the mistake! And McTiernan definitely turned his movie to politically correct, by locating the rollerball games in a poor country in central Asia.Add to it this French actor, Jean Reno, who absolutely doesn't belong in here and ridiculizes himself more than anything else and you have a zero movie, one of the worse ever directed by McTiernan, maybe his worst, along with ""Medicine Man"". The advice I could give McTiernan is try to be more personal and independent, and to write screenplays of his own. What are the use and interest spending so much dough to produce things like this?

These spots featured absurd imaginary sports being played in some dry and dusty location which looked vaguely Central Asian. The tag line was, ""sports news from the only region you care about --- yours.""This new version of Rollerball looks like it was taken from one of those FSN commercials. Gone is the SF storyline of the original story. Rather than set the story in the future, the film makers transposed it to Central Asia in the present day, post-Soviet world.The game vaguely resembles the original Rollerball, but is so hastily edited and poorly choreographed that nothing of what made the original game so compelling remains. It's just blow stuff up. Instead of drama, you get bashed in faces. In fact, although there's plenty of mindless action, there's actually less game footage than in the original... and less action.Jean Reno delivers a terrible performance as the capitalist mogul who is (gasp!) deliberately cranking up the violence in the game for (gasp!) higher ratings. With the wretched script he's given, he could hardly be expected to fill the shoes of the role played by John Houseman, the icy corporate chief of the original.As for Chris Klein... Granted, he doesn't have much of a script to work with, but I still found his performance annoying.  I've seen him do better work (""Election"") but he doesn't project the kind of screen presence James Caan did in the original.Curiously, although the script dispenses with the science fiction background, it does have men and women playing on the same team, and showering in co-ed locker rooms. I seriously doubt there is a culture anywhere on Earth today where men and women would participate in full contact sports together, let alone get undressed in the same locker room. There would have to be some very intense social upheaval to make that happen, particularly in Central Asia, which is a fairly conservative part of the world.If you thought ""Replicant"" was a great movie, then you might like this one; but frankly, folks, Chris Klein's performance makes Jean Claude van Damme look like Olivier.

Suddenly a lightbulb goes on over his head:STUDIO EXEC(to SECRETARY, O.S.)Call John McTiernan!  Have him redo anotherNormal Jewison film.  What else has that geezerdone?! (rifling through old DGA directory) (Beat)Rollerball!!  Perfect!!  Violence, fast-paced, slinkygirls, lots of stunts, loud music!  Perfect!Maybe...  Anyway, we now return to our original review.So when McT, as he refers to himself on other commentaries (one of my major disappointments about this so-called special edition is the lack of a McTiernan wry, dry, and ever so enjoyable commentary), brings in the sensibilities of the original version, but addresses the subject in a more 2000-friendly way (i.e., ratings, and the immediacy of the decisions), he is shouted down because he didn't do what someone with a pre-conceived notion about what the remake ""should"" be expected.Pardon the expression, but to borrow from good ol' Colonel Potter (and the writers of M*A*S*H), this is a bunch of ""horse feathers.""  The film has an excellent pace, an engaging, lively soundtrack, and fun action.  OK, so Chris Klein and Rebecca Romijn aren't Tracy and Hepburn, but this is the first role I've seen Chris Klein in where he has an edge.  He actually looks not like the puppy he normally looks, but someone who, when driven to it, can kill.  And I credit McTiernan with bringing that out of him.Overall, yes, this is not an Oscar-winning weaper for which Merryl could win an Oscar because she learned another accent, but as far as summer entertainment, I'd say it's superior to most.",4,"""The Thomas Crowne Affair"" it may not be...",1113264000,"04 12, 2005",2005,2238,"['gentle', 'reader', 'believe', 'movie', 'not', 'horror', 'previous', 'few', 'reviewers', 'thought', 'would', 'be.To', 'begin', 'John', 'McTiernan', ""n't"", 'faithfully', 'redo', 'classics', 'Instead', 'modern', 'action', 'film', 'modern', 'concepts', 'modern', 'values', 'almost', 'always', 'better', 'average', 'often', 'exceptional', 'characters', 'Think', 'aforementioned', 'Thomas', 'Crowne', 'Affair', 'plot', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'Norman', 'Jewison', 'version', 'oh', 'gee', 'who', 'directed', '1975', 'version', 'Rollerball', 'forget', 'However', 'very', 'similar', 'sensibilities', 'are', 'there', '1999', 'version.Hmm', 'FADE', 'IN', 'Studio', 'exec', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'next', 'production', 'Suddenly', 'lightbulb', 'head', 'STUDIO', 'EXEC', 'SECRETARY', 'O.S', 'Call', 'John', 'McTiernan', 'Have', 'redo', 'anotherNormal', 'Jewison', 'film', 'What', 'else', 'geezerdone', 'rifling', 'old', 'DGA', 'directory', 'Beat', 'Rollerball', 'Perfect', 'Violence', 'fast-paced', 'slinkygirls', 'lots', 'stunts', 'loud', 'music', 'Perfect', 'Maybe', 'Anyway', 'now', 'return', 'original', 'review.So', 'when', 'McT', 'other', 'commentaries', 'one', 'major', 'disappointments', 'so-called', 'special', 'edition', 'lack', 'McTiernan', 'wry', 'dry', 'ever', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'commentary', 'sensibilities', 'original', 'version', 'subject', 'more', '2000-friendly', 'way', 'i.e.', 'ratings', 'immediacy', 'decisions', 'shouted', 'down', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'what', 'someone', 'pre-conceived', 'notion', 'what', 'remake', 'should', 'be', 'expected.Pardon', 'expression', 'borrow', 'good', 'ol', 'Colonel', 'Potter', 'writers', 'M*A*S*H', 'bunch', 'horse', 'feathers', 'film', 'excellent', 'pace', 'engaging', 'lively', 'soundtrack', 'fun', 'action', 'OK', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'Rebecca', 'Romijn', 'are', ""n't"", 'Tracy', 'Hepburn', 'first', 'role', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'where', 'edge', 'actually', 'not', 'puppy', 'normally', 'someone', 'who', 'when', 'driven', 'can', 'kill', 'credit', 'McTiernan', 'bringing', 'him.Overall', 'yes', 'not', 'Oscar-winning', 'weaper', 'Merryl', 'could', 'win', 'Oscar', 'learned', 'accent', 'as', 'far', 'summer', 'entertainment', ""'d"", 'say', 'superior', 'most']",Rollerball VHS

Stathoulopoulos ""nick9155""","[2, 5]","Rollerball still stands as a solid sci-fi flick about the fear of corporate society and the crushing of the little guy (you).  Sadly, if you look around, we're slowly approaching it.Fast forward to now and we have yet another remake.  With Rollerball (2002) I am now convinced that these remakes serve a functional purpose: to make the originals look like masterpieces.  If there is another reason, I've yet to see it.  At this point, I would be less insulted if Hollywood studios publicly declared: We have no ideas, we are bankrupt of original thoughts, so we'll just resell you the same thing, over and over.The sickest thing about John McTiernan's Rollerball remake is that it had potential.  The original film took place in a sterilized future world where corporations had taken the place of nations, society had everything it needed, and the main distraction for the pesty public was the ultraviolent sport of rollerball.  Jonathan E began to meddle by somehow surviving the sport year after year and began to shine, which is exactly what the corporations did NOT want.  The sport was to prove the futility of individual effort.In the remake, the setting is the near future, but the concerns are not global like the original.  Rollerball is more a fringe sport (like Slamball, or Arena Football, or backyard wrestling) operating out of central Asia (any of the '-stan' countries of the old Soviet empire.)  For the miserable masses who slave in mines, the sport, which is less coherent here than the original film, provides a distraction from their meaningless lives (sort of like all sports do, anyway.)I did like this idea for the setting, making rollerball a regional interest rather than global phenomenon.  It actually makes it more realistic, and indeed there are references to WWE wrestling, which it resembles in the glitzy pageantry and shameless profiteering.  This, along with other elements, are wasted in the ensuing chaos.An NHL draftee (Chris Klein, doing a career Keanu impersonation that is frightening) flees the USA because he's been busy illegally body-boarding down San Fran streets and runs off with LL Cool J to play for big money in the rollerball leauge.  The (naturally) evil team owner is Jean Reno, who covets more and more ratings by getting rid of rules, penalties, and other pesty elements of the sport that prevent people from dying.  This is all to satisfy some kind of global ratings meter that is instant and will gauge who is tuning in when.I could go on and on about this film.  It was famously plagued during post-production (not to mention pre-production, production, and the 'idea', casting, and all other phases.)  The film is incoherent, plain and simple.  What you would call a mess.It is highly recommended to bad movie buffs the world over.  I picked this baby up at a 2-for-$15 sale--that's less than the cost of seeing this clinker in the theater!  The DVD wisely throws in many extras to entice you and to give you something approaching value after you realize how appalling the film is.The other recommendation is to buy the original Rollerball on DVD, also a good value.I now heartily endorse remakes like this one, as I'm sure Norman Jewison (director of the original) does.

Zwick,"[12, 19]","`Rollerball' is a god-awful remake of the 1975 Norman Jewison film about a fictional sport in which murdering the players becomes a primary object of the game. The original film acquired what little credibility it had by setting the story sometime in the distant future. This version is set in the present, but it tries to maintain its believability by locating the league in Southwest Asia, under the parochial assumption, I suppose, that that part of the world is every bit as alien, exotic and dehumanized as any hypothetical future society. It doesn't work. It is simply impossible for us to believe even for a split second that the owners and promoters of this sport would think they could get away with such murderous shenanigans broadcast live to millions of viewers the world over. Might not the United Nations, among other international organizations, have a thing or two to say about all this? Also, will someone please explain to me just WHAT purpose is served by having the promoters of this sport killing off their own players? Doesn't that sort of deplete their own resources for future games? I can't imagine too many people willingly signing on to engage in this sort of gladiatorial tomfoolery.Even if we agreed to swallow the whole thing merely for the sake of the entertainment value of the film, we would be forced to admit that `Rollerball' is a chintzy, clunky, uninteresting movie in all respects. The sport itself - sort of a cross between motor cross racing, roller derby, hockey and basketball - is completely unexciting, consisting of little more than blurred figures racing madly around a cramped, claustrophobic track. Without even the context of good action sequences, `Rollerball' is forced to fall back on its dialogue and characters, which proves to be disastrous for all concerned. Chris Klein, in the role of hotshot Jonathon Cross - played by James Caan in the original - comes across as a minor league version of Keanu Reeves. LL Cool J is wasted in the part of Jonathon's American sidekick, and poor Jean Reno gets to play one of the most laughable villains we've run across in a movie in a long long long long time.In fact, this redux turns out to be good for nothing BUT a few hearty laughs.

His conscience kicks in, and he tries to find a way to stop it.The special effects in the movie are nice, they scenes are patched together so it really looks like they're playing the game, flying through the air, and doing a bunch of stunts. The costumes are flashy, everyone has their own unique style, from a gladiator down to someone in a tutu. Everything is done in a flashy way, with lots of sparks or flashy lights.The soundtrack fits the movie, there's hard rock for the games and parties and slower music for other scenes. The Rob Zombie song is well picked, it fits in with the style of the movie. What I liked best about the music is that you didn't really notice it, there weren't points that stood out and made you go ""Why on earth did they pick that piece?""Overall I'd give it 3 stars. The first is for the music, it was appropriate. The second star is for the costumes and set design, it really made the movie more substantial, although not by much. And, the third star would be for a simple plot that's hard to screw up. Rollerball isn't the next great movie, but it's one that can be fun to watch if you let your brain go.",3,"Eye Candy and Good Music, but Little Else",1030060800,"08 23, 2002",2002,1757,"[""'d"", 'never', 'had', 'interest', 'seeing', 'movie', 'dad', 'had', 'rented', 'so', 'watched', 'visiting', 'equate', 'movie', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'not', 'bad', ""'re"", 'willing', 'just', 'let', 'mind', 'go.The', 'plot', 'pretty', 'straight', 'forward', 'Johnathon', 'Cross', 'extreme', 'sports', 'junkie', 'persuaded', 'friend', 'play', 'Rollerball', 'cross', 'soccer', 'rollerblading', 'anything', 'being', 'played', 'Asia', 'start', 'player', 'team', 'perks', 'including', 'getting', 'cozy', 'fellow', 'teammate', 'then', 'discovers', 'owners', 'teams', 'are', 'staging', 'fights', 'accidents', 'boost', 'ratings', 'conscience', 'kicks', 'find', 'way', 'stop', 'it.The', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'are', 'nice', 'scenes', 'are', 'patched', 'together', 'really', ""'re"", 'playing', 'game', 'flying', 'air', 'doing', 'bunch', 'stunts', 'costumes', 'are', 'flashy', 'everyone', 'own', 'unique', 'style', 'gladiator', 'down', 'someone', 'tutu', 'Everything', 'done', 'flashy', 'way', 'lots', 'sparks', 'flashy', 'lights.The', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'hard', 'rock', 'games', 'parties', 'slower', 'music', 'other', 'scenes', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'song', 'well', 'picked', 'style', 'movie', 'What', 'liked', 'best', 'music', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'notice', 'were', ""n't"", 'points', 'stood', 'out', 'made', 'go', 'Why', 'earth', 'did', 'pick', 'piece', 'Overall', ""'d"", 'give', '3', 'stars', 'first', 'music', 'was', 'appropriate', 'second', 'star', 'costumes', 'set', 'design', 'really', 'made', 'movie', 'more', 'substantial', 'not', 'much', 'third', 'star', 'would', 'be', 'simple', 'plot', 'hard', 'screw', 'up', 'Rollerball', ""n't"", 'next', 'great', 'movie', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'fun', 'watch', 'let', 'brain', 'go']",Rollerball VHS

Just like a cross between rollerskating and ice hockey, people all over the world are excited watching the thrilling games - well, he wants it that way. No enters Chris Klein's character that soon becomes a new hero of the circuit, but he realizes that some heinous plot is going on when one of his teammates got heavily injured by receiving a big iron ball in the face.Well, that is the film's story, sort of. Actually, nothing really makes sense in those badly edited ""game scenes"" where players are seen hitting each other rollerskating, and motorcycles with howling engines stumbling on the rink (and one of the riders is beautiful Rebecca Romijn-Stamos from ""X-Men"" but you cannot recognize her ... again.) To be honest, I had no idea of what is going on and I'm afraid you won't either. Rules? Sorry, I thought there was an introductory part about them, but I stopped caring as the film got more and more incredible.The original ""Rollerball"" a cult film by Norman Jewison, knew what it wanted by drawing the bleak vision of our near future and its actions are still refreshing and exciting to see. But this remake most unaccountably ignores the tone of the original's futuristic society and stays content just showing meaninglessly violent stunts. The film remains pointless throughout I thought as it has no drama not even a decent story and no character. The game scenes look terribly bland. In fact they look dull compared with what we can see on some cable TV programs.To be fair, there are some good action scenes like opening skateboarding race or bike chasing in the midnight. But strangely they have virtually nothing to with the premise of the film, game of the title. Chris Klein is good and Jean Reno is just OK, but the latter's charisma seen in such great films as ""The Professional"" cannot be found here.
