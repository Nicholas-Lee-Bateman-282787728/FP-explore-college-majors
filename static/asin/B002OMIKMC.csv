I bought this because the premise appealed to me: short workouts over 30 days to develop a workout habit and achieve a baseline of fitness.What a letdown! None of the exercisers seem to have any sense of rhythm. They're out of sync with the music and even with each other, which makes it difficult to follow. The two who are performing modifications aren't consistent either, e.g., they seem to each have their own version about how a given move should be performed. Add to this the generally 'lost' look that all of them share, as if they don't know what's coming next and they're waiting to find out, and this DVD becomes unnecessarily hard to follow smoothly.For the brand, I expected far better.",2,Not worth it,1278028800,"07 2, 2010",2010,789,"['do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'familiarity', 'expectations', ""'cast"", 'bought', 'premise', 'appealed', 'short', 'workouts', '30', 'days', 'develop', 'workout', 'habit', 'achieve', 'baseline', 'fitness.What', 'letdown', 'None', 'exercisers', 'seem', 'have', 'sense', 'rhythm', ""'re"", 'sync', 'music', 'even', 'other', 'difficult', 'follow', 'two', 'who', 'are', 'performing', 'modifications', 'are', ""n't"", 'consistent', 'either', 'e.g.', 'seem', 'have', 'own', 'version', 'how', 'given', 'move', 'should', 'be', 'performed', 'Add', 'generally', ""'lost"", 'look', 'share', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'next', ""'re"", 'waiting', 'find', 'out', 'DVD', 'unnecessarily', 'hard', 'follow', 'brand', 'expected', 'far', 'better']",The Biggest Loser: 30-Day Jump Start
1281255,A2K5128BI2GKGK,B002OMIKMC,"Ames ""Workout Girl""","[1, 2]","I am one to buy The Biggest Loser dvds. In fact I feel like Ill be missing something if I dont! However I probably should have looked into this one more before wasting time and money.Routines: The routines themselves were decent, although not very challenging. Tara's cardio segment is probably the best one since you really get your heart rate up for almost the entire 10 minutes. The rest were just mediocre. Flailing weights around....proper form was barely discussed. The amount of reps werent even on each side and Ive felt like ive ""been there done that"".Trainers: This was the biggest downfall of them all. Without reading the back in detail, you have no way of knowing Bob isn't the trainer. This really knocked the appeal down---big time! Although the contestants were halfway decent and they obviously really tried, they still felt short. The appeal of buying workout dvds is to have people (trainers) instruct and guide you...not just any old people who have lost weight. If thats the case, maybe *I* should make my own workout dvd. Again, they dont talk about proper form, were clumsy in their words, and if i had to hear another ""Im proud of you"" I might not believe it. In Sione's upper body workout with weights he mentions how we are ""burning a ton of calories"". Uhh no we arent...in fact barely at all in that segment. Bob and Jillian always said you must work upper and lower together constantly because working arms just doesnt cut it. It was also frustrating to me to hear them talk like they knew what they were talking about, when it was words just to fill in the silence.I hope Jillian's 30 Day Jump Start is better than this, because they really let me down this time.

1281256,AWVQR7YYTYJ1L,B002OMIKMC,Brittany Rose,"[1, 2]","The main purpose of buying this DVD would be for one of two reasons: one, you're ready to get in shape again but have heard how tough the Biggest Loser DVD series is. Two, you've been working out for awhile and you want to keep it up on a (near) daily basis - but you don't always have the time or energy to do a full 30-60 minute workout.This DVD includes five 10-minute programs, all of which incorporate a brief warm-up and cool-down. Two cardio levels (one with weights, one without), and programs focused on abs, upper body, and lower body - although being the Biggest Loser, most programs integrate all of these things. Despite only being 10 minutes, each program definitely gets your heart and your breathing revved up - these aren't workouts for the weak at heart, even in a condensed form.Interestingly, despite what the cover may imply, the DVD does not feature Biggest Loser's Bob Harper as the trainer. Fan faves Sione and Tara, plus obnoxious first female winner Ally are the stars who take turns hosting the programs - sometimes even within a single segment. All three of them do a passable job, but lack the ease and motivation of Bob or Jillian. Tara is probably the most spirited, Sione is the most natural, and Ally is just irritating as per usual - she also comes off as the most nervous despite her constant desire to give every move more than 100%.Overall, having used various workout dvds for the last 9 months, I'm glad I own this one. It might not burn an excessive number of calories, but it's perfect to throw on when I have only a bit of time to work out and still enables me to feel like I'm keeping up with my workout goals. Plus you can do more than one program if you really want to workout for longer. As I said, it's also great if you want an introduction to the Biggest Loser style of workout dvds - a challenge to be sure, but the bite size portions make it worth it.",4,"Good To Start, Good To Keep Up",1263600000,"01 16, 2010",2010,1902,"['main', 'purpose', 'buying', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'two', 'reasons', 'one', ""'re"", 'ready', 'get', 'shape', 'again', 'have', 'heard', 'how', 'tough', 'Biggest', 'Loser', 'DVD', 'series', 'Two', ""'ve"", 'been', 'working', 'out', 'awhile', 'want', 'keep', 'up', 'daily', 'basis', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'have', 'time', 'energy', 'do', 'full', '30-60', 'minute', 'workout.This', 'DVD', 'five', '10-minute', 'programs', 'incorporate', 'brief', 'warm-up', 'cool-down', 'Two', 'cardio', 'levels', 'one', 'weights', 'one', 'programs', 'focused', 'abs', 'upper', 'body', 'lower', 'body', 'being', 'Biggest', 'Loser', 'most', 'programs', 'integrate', 'things', 'only', 'being', '10', 'minutes', 'program', 'definitely', 'heart', 'breathing', 'revved', 'up', 'are', ""n't"", 'workouts', 'weak', 'heart', 'even', 'condensed', 'form.Interestingly', 'what', 'cover', 'may', 'imply', 'DVD', 'not', 'feature', 'Biggest', 'Loser', 'Bob', 'Harper', 'trainer', 'Fan', 'Sione', 'Tara', 'obnoxious', 'first', 'female', 'winner', 'Ally', 'are', 'stars', 'who', 'take', 'turns', 'hosting', 'programs', 'sometimes', 'even', 'single', 'segment', 'three', 'do', 'passable', 'job', 'lack', 'ease', 'motivation', 'Bob', 'Jillian', 'Tara', 'probably', 'most', 'spirited', 'Sione', 'most', 'natural', 'Ally', 'just', 'irritating', 'usual', 'also', 'off', 'most', 'nervous', 'constant', 'desire', 'give', 'move', 'more', '100', '%', '.Overall', 'having', 'used', 'various', 'workout', 'dvds', 'last', '9', 'months', ""'m"", 'glad', 'own', 'one', 'might', 'not', 'burn', 'excessive', 'number', 'calories', 'perfect', 'throw', 'when', 'have', 'only', 'bit', 'time', 'work', 'out', 'still', 'enables', 'feel', ""'m"", 'keeping', 'up', 'workout', 'goals', 'can', 'do', 'more', 'one', 'program', 'really', 'want', 'workout', 'longer', 'said', 'also', 'great', 'want', 'introduction', 'Biggest', 'Loser', 'style', 'workout', 'dvds', 'challenge', 'be', 'sure', 'bite', 'size', 'portions', 'make']",The Biggest Loser: 30-Day Jump Start
1281257,A17V9XL4CWTQ6G,B002OMIKMC,Chandler,"[83, 84]","I have to agree with the other reviewer that I was hoping for another dvd with Bob as the trainer. I have always found his dvds to be high calorie burners and extremely motivational due to his warm yet strong training style. But one thing about the Biggest Loser you know if you watch it is that many of the contestants go on to become trainers themselves and they did choose some good trainers for this and it does mix things up a bit. However, with Bob at the center of the picture, one would think it's the same as past dvds...Bob does give diet and motivation tips on the dvd but does not train you as a trainer.CALORIC BURN: As far as calorie burn, like the contestants on the show I wear a Bodybugg (the black electronic gadgets on arm bands) which measures my daily caloric burn. Because of this, I am also able to measure exactly how many calories I burn per workout and how many calories I burn per minute of any workout. This enables me to compare how effective a workout is against the many other workouts I own. I mention this only so you know what I say is based upon scientific measurement rather than perceived exertion.  I bought the other new Biggest Loser dvd which is Jillian's ""Last Chance Workout"" at the same time I bought this one so I was able to compare both as well as compare them to the previous Biggest Loser dvds, all of which I already own. While this had a decent calorie burn, it wasn't as high as many of the other ones already out, nor was it as high as the other new Biggest Loser dvd released on the same date. (Jillian's Last Chance Workout) However, I actually ENJOYED this one more in some regards because I like the fact that it used the medicine ball and bands that I have and rarely have a good workout to use them with...you could do the workouts with just weights, (and not all workouts use these so you may not ever use them at all) but this adds interest for me and prevented boredom. Still, it has a higher burn than many fitness dvds (Biggest Loser and Jillian's dvds are all pretty good on calorie burn) so it's a good addition to my collection.If you are looking to do the segment with the highest calorie burn, choose Alli's ""cardio 2"" which also combines weights. The lowest calorie burn on this dvd is Sione's upper body workout. While I typically don't quote how many calories I personally burned because it's going to vary per person based on muscle density, height, weight etc...just to give you a guage of how extremely low it was...I burned only 23 calories in his segment. No, I didn't forget the third digit. This shows why you need to combine 2 of the ten minute workouts on this dvd rather than just doing one in order to achieve any results.(the others were WAY above that one.) Unfortunately, the dvd does not allow you to combine segments easily. I'll get to that in a minute. (If you combine Sione's and Alli's you will get a good burn and that's what I do. For a good workout combine one of the cardio segments with another of your choice.)CUEING: The instructors all have their teaching methods down, in spite of the fact they were contestants trying to lose weight themselves not long ago. Beginners will be able to easily pick up steps but those more advanced can tackle the more strenuous moves and enable their own fitness level to increase. You will not only know how to do the steps, but how to do them safely as well and correctly so they are effective.  Good training. Good energy. A good combo of moves.STRENGTH AND CARDIO: I love the dvds that contain a combo of both strength and cardio, which you will find here. Not all segments combine the two. You can do just cardio or cardio and strength. Cardio burns the most calories in the shortest amount of time, but strength training enables your body to keep burning more calories long after the workout is over and develop more muscle which also increases metabolism and allows your body to burn more calories even while at rest--in spite of the fact that you burn less during the workout with strength training.  The most effective workouts have been shown to get your heart rate up in its target zone, then switch to muscle building to add strength while it's still high, then go back to cardio and you'll get this here for double the results.MARKETING: They titled this dvd the same as their 30 day jumpstart book and their new website to lose weight of the same name. You don't need any of the others to coincide with each other but dang that show is good at marketing. (grin)MUSIC: Upbeat and to the pace of the moves. Keeps you motivated and revved.SEGMENTS: 5 10-minute segments. 50 minutes total The calorie burn in a ten minute segment is not going to be enough to make much difference unless you combine two segments and make it a 20 minute workout, according to my caloric measurement. In this case, you'd get a good workout. Unfortunately, the dvd only allows you to choose one routine at a time unlike most of the other Biggest Loser dvds where you can pick a few to combine in the beginning. And, because some segments are all cardio with no strength, you'll burn less overall than the other Biggest Loser or Jillian dvds that combine the two for a deep calorie blasting circuit workout. I don't want to do a routine that ends in a cooldown then start all over again with a warm up in another segment when I'm already very warmed up but you have to if you want to do more than a low calorie burning 10 minute workout...odd that they did this on this one. It's like they only wanted you to do a ten minute segment and nothing more rather than being able to combine two.MUSCLES WORKED: This is very well-rounded and hits 'em all.EQUIPMENT: hand weights, a stability ball (the large air filled ball you can sit on--optional, you can do the moves standing or on a Bosu), medicine ball (this is a small weighted ball. Optional. You can use anything weight including a gallon of milk which is their suggestion or a large can of something like beans. I varied between my kettlebell and my medicine ball.) bands, (optional, you can use your hand weights) floor mat for ab workNEGATIVES: Although I appreciate the trainers and their excellent moves and cueing, it still felt slightly as though this was their first workout dvd...because it was. There was just a faint of nervousness...although there is nothing I could pinpoint exactly to illustrate this...they did a great job for someone new at doing a fitness dvd but there was a slight air of discomfort on camera and in showing others the moves I gotta say. I would have loved for Bob to have at least done one segment but I applaud the contestants for doing well under their first spotlight..ALTERNATIVES:Should you progress to wanting a higher calorie burn but the same great instruction, cardio and strength training, you might try:(in no particular order):1.Body by Jake Total Body Workout2.Jillian's Banish Fat, Boost Metabolim and Last Chance Workout3.Kathy Smith Build Muscle Shrink Fat4.Crunch Total Resculpt5.Star Trainers: Strength6. Weight Loss Cardio Sculpt with Violet ZakiCONCLUSION: Few dvds kept up my interest as much as this one did and I love it for that because it will keep you coming back to it. However, the calorie burn wasn't quite as high as its predecessors for only being able to do a 10 minute run and not combine two segments easily and I was a little surprised to see trainers with less experience leading the moves rather than Bob but I can't fault them...they did a nice job in spite of some discomfort showing. If you only have time for a ten minute workout, I'd skip Sione's. His instruction is good but the calorie burn won't even cover a bite of something. Combine his with one or two others for good results.",4,Lower calorie burn than most other Biggest Loser dvds but fun to do and kept my interest.

1281258,A1EHTFVSD0H7I6,B002OMIKMC,Kelly Klepfer,"[1, 2]","I'm not a fitness expert...so consider my thoughts through that lens.Jump Start would be a great introduction to the nuts and bolts of workouts. In ten minute increments the participant is given a decent building block of exercises. The participant starts out with 10 minutes a day, and works up into 30 minutes a day. There is a cardio, upper and lower body workout. The same workouts are repeated during the week, however, not back-to-back day-after-day. The following weeks build on that first week's schedule.Biggest Loser's Bob Harper shares some healthy eating and inspirational information that is building block and common sense as well. The exercises are led by Biggest Losers winners (not all THE Biggest Loser but several favorites who've personally won through changing their lives.) This in itself is inspiring because anyone who watches the show knows where those folks started. And it is encouraging to see folks who are now in great shape still talking about hating a certain exercise or breathing hard/sweating while working out.I think Biggest Loser fans who aren't currently exercising would make a good choice in getting this DVD. It could be helpful. and a great introduction to exercising and learning the nuts and bolts of how and why certain things are done certain ways. Anyone who is looking for a killer or very difficult workout won't likely be challenged though. I rented it and won't be buying it because after a week, I found that I wanted a little more change-up.

Even though the program is divided into quick 10 minute workouts over the 30 days, they were brutal and had me struggling to keep up. I'm not totally unfit either. I can do a full 4 mile workout with Leslie Sansone, no problem. But the high impact aerobics in this program had me struggling to keep up and had my joints begging for mercy. I'm not very overweight either.

He's my favorite trainer from this series and even though his picture is on the cover (as Jillian's is on the Last Chance Workout) he does not lead any of the exercise circuits.  I missed him. (He does show up giving motivational/diet/training tips)Anyway, this DVD has 5 (five), 10-minute workouts with a short warm-up/cool-down included in the 10 minutes.  Tara leads the first Cardio section.  It includes marching, jumping jacks, knee-up (low or high impact), twists, etc.  Liz and Daniel provide beginner modifications.  This is a good place for beginners to start.Ali leads the second cardio section.  I like this one because it includes resistance to get the heartrate up and keep it there.  You will need a weighted ball, dumbells, and/or resistance bands.  (Daniel again provides beginner modications.)  She does punches with weights, side lunges with a medicine ball, squats with weights over head, etc.  A good full-body workout.Sione leads the third upper body section.  He again starts with a short warm-up emphasizes your upper body and core.  He then uses weights and a large stability ball (or workout bench) to work the biceps, chest, back, shoulders, etc., and ends with a stretch.Ali leads the lower body section starting with a warm-up and then completing lunges, squats, side, lunges. ""donkey kicks (on hands and knees) and ends with a stretch.Tara and Sione end the DVD with an ab and core workout.  Again, the warm-ups and cool-downs are included in the 10 minutes, so if you want to get a constant workout, you'll have to skip between sections.All three of the instructors are encouraging and keep the class flowing, but there seems to be a ""charisma"" missing with them that Bob supplies.Also included in the DVD is recipe booklet and an offer for a free workout music CD if you have an MP3 program on your computer.This DVD is not as tough as the ""Last Chance Workout), but if you skip the cool-downs and work harder on the warm-ups, you can make this a continuous flowing session.  That's what I miss about the programmable DVD the Biggest Loser produced before.  It had a warm-up, cool-down, section and then you were able to group all of the cardion sections (or strength sections) together for a personal workout.  That said, this is still a good workout.",4,Where's Bob???,1259712000,"12 2, 2009",2009,2307,"['What', 'happened', 'Bob', 'favorite', 'trainer', 'series', 'even', 'picture', 'cover', 'Jillian', 'Last', 'Chance', 'Workout', 'not', 'lead', 'exercise', 'missed', 'show', 'up', 'giving', 'motivational/diet/training', 'tips', 'Anyway', 'DVD', '5', 'five', '10-minute', 'workouts', 'short', 'warm-up/cool-down', 'included', '10', 'minutes', 'Tara', 'first', 'Cardio', 'section', 'marching', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'knee-up', 'low', 'high', 'impact', 'twists', 'etc', 'Liz', 'Daniel', 'provide', 'beginner', 'modifications', 'good', 'place', 'beginners', 'start.Ali', 'second', 'cardio', 'section', 'one', 'resistance', 'get', 'heartrate', 'up', 'keep', 'there', 'will', 'need', 'weighted', 'ball', 'dumbells', 'and/or', 'resistance', 'bands', 'Daniel', 'again', 'beginner', 'modications', 'punches', 'weights', 'side', 'lunges', 'medicine', 'ball', 'squats', 'weights', 'head', 'etc', 'good', 'full-body', 'workout.Sione', 'third', 'upper', 'body', 'section', 'again', 'short', 'warm-up', 'upper', 'body', 'core', 'then', 'weights', 'large', 'stability', 'ball', 'bench', 'work', 'biceps', 'chest', 'back', 'shoulders', 'etc.', 'stretch.Ali', 'lower', 'body', 'section', 'starting', 'warm-up', 'then', 'completing', 'lunges', 'squats', 'side', 'donkey', 'kicks', 'hands', 'knees', 'stretch.Tara', 'Sione', 'end', 'DVD', 'ab', 'core', 'workout', 'Again', 'warm-ups', 'cool-downs', 'are', 'included', '10', 'minutes', 'so', 'want', 'get', 'constant', 'workout', ""'ll"", 'have', 'skip', 'sections.All', 'three', 'instructors', 'are', 'encouraging', 'keep', 'class', 'flowing', 'there', 'be', 'charisma', 'missing', 'Bob', 'supplies.Also', 'included', 'DVD', 'recipe', 'booklet', 'offer', 'free', 'workout', 'music', 'CD', 'have', 'MP3', 'program', 'computer.This', 'DVD', 'not', 'as', 'tough', 'Last', 'Chance', 'Workout', 'skip', 'cool-downs', 'work', 'harder', 'warm-ups', 'can', 'make', 'continuous', 'flowing', 'session', 'what', 'miss', 'programmable', 'DVD', 'Biggest', 'Loser', 'produced', 'had', 'warm-up', 'cool-down', 'section', 'then', 'were', 'able', 'group', 'cardion', 'sections', 'strength', 'sections', 'together', 'personal', 'workout', 'said', 'still', 'good', 'workout']",The Biggest Loser: 30-Day Jump Start
