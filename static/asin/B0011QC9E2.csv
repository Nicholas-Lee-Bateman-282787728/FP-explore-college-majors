While it was cute and different from what they are used to, it just can't hold a candle to the animation and computer effects of today's movies.The story is a good, wholesome one.

Younger folks may have trouble understanding the rhymed dialogue, but they will certainly enjoy the action, and there is plenty of it. Davie and his lamb Chops, who sports little butterfly wings and flies with ease, first try out their strength against a mechanical monster, and as the Storyteller philosophizes, ""Sometimes it takes failing a test, in order to prepare for a much longer one."" Later they get to battle with the mean giant Golimyr, whose ""appetite grows for a destruction buffet,"" and here the story takes on the biblical ""David and Goliath"" comparison, as Davie, a peaceful pear grower, has not much else but faith, a sling and a pear to go on.I like the way the ""Isles of the Sea"" are pictured (it reminds me a little of ""Waterworld""!), and especially like the impish fellow who is in the company of the Storyteller. The faces are expressive, and the colors bright. And also, there is a lovely twist to the tale, adding God's infinite mercy and the ability in all of us, no matter how dark and grumpy, to change.

The stop-motion animation was unusual and imaginative, but the strangeness of some of the characters detracted from the telling of the story, which, by the way, was done in rhyme.Deciding that I was perhaps a bit older than the target audience, I ran it for my son, and his very first comment was that it wasn't drawn properly.  I spent the next fifteen minutes fielding questions about why some of the people had other people living on their heads, and others didn't, and why they didn't have legs, and why did a sheep have wings, and why the people were so ugly.  The narrator and his minstrel were considered b-o-ring, and he lost interest in everything except the final battle. (He didn't make it all the way to the end of the DVD)PROS:1. Slightly different retelling of the story of David & Goliath, where the young hero proves his faith in God using a sling, some stones and a spiritually-enhanced pear.2. Not your standard animation3. Only 45 minutes longCONS:1. The characters, while quirky and unusual, don't fit in very well with the flow of story, causing unnecessary distractions2. Many unlikeable characters3.

1132203,A34PCCROYXQM77,B0011QC9E2,"B. Breen ""Canuckster1127""","[1, 1]","Davie and Golimyr is a stop action animation film that appears to be trying to bring together Veggie Tales with Wallace and Grommit.  It is a Biblically based retelling of David and Goliath but focuses more upon that as a theme than being Scripturally accurate.  If your kids can handle slushies being launched from the walls of Jericho (A Veggie Tales classic), then you'll probably find nothing objectionable in this retelling of the Scriptural tale which ends in the Giant being reformed rather than killed.As an adult I found the tale to be creative and engaging, but I was taxed to pay attention for the full 45 minutes of the feature.  Thankfully, my co-reviewer, a 6 year old rumored to live at home with my wife and me, was able to lend his expertise to the experience and for the most part he found it interesting and funny.  He still asks to view it occassionally in between his other repeat favorites and that really is the ultimate test for him.  When questioned on what he liked about the feature, he responded that it was funny and he liked the flying sheep especially.All in all, for a home feature video, there is nothing to object to in terms of content or pace.  It's aimed for a younger audience.

It's about an aspiring young warrior named Davie, who is the only resident of the land of the Zites to stand up to the terrible giant Golimyr, with the help of his flying sheep Chops. Golimyr hears of the ""faith"" that the Zites possess, and he decides to take it as though it were a treasure, then force the Zites to bow to him as their new king.  So Davie becomes, quite literally, ""defender of the faith"".  It's told in rhyming couplets reminiscent of Dr. Seuss' verse, though not as clever.  But the strength of this video is the amusing and inventive stop-motion animation and design, based on the work of illustrator James Christensen, which makes it enjoyable to watch and makes the message that much more palatable.

1132208,AWIF8AR75LL9L,B0011QC9E2,"Colorgirl ""Spreading color around my world""","[0, 0]","When I first saw this DVD I was not sure what to think.  It seems that every time someone tries to make over a traditional story, they tend to do a substandard job and I end up disappointed.With Davie and Golimyr I am still not sure what to think.  The story just left me asking one question- ""Why?""Why did they go to all this effort to take a really good story and chop it, dice it, slice it, and add all kinds of other stuff to it, when it was really a great story to begin with?  Why not just start fresh?What this ended up being was like a merging of THE NEVERHOOD, KRYANDIA, GUMBY, WALLACE AND GROMMIT, with a splash of the biblical story of David facing the giant Goliath to add a bit of flavor.This story takes place in a totally fanciful background.  It is about a king of a bizarre fantasy land of Zites.  There is a giant threatening the peaceful land (his name, of course, is Golimyr) and the only one who comes forward to defeat this giant is Davie- who grows pears and has a flying sheep named Chops.The movie is filled with total fantasty characters who are half strange looking robots, combinations of bits and pieces of things- like a guy with a castle on his head, odd combinations of rocks made into a ship, and a windmill that is powered by sneezes, a flying sheep......Davie learns through a pear that his faith can grow from being small and he can live a fruitful life, and he vanquishes the giant.I am having a hard time reviewing this movie, because on one hand, it is very colorful and the animation is really beautiful and bright and detailed.  However, on the other hand, this movie annoyed me.When I played this for my entire family, the reactions were varied.  The story is told in rhyme, and the tale is supposed to be entertaining with all kinds of crazy odd things and bizarre characters.The film has such good potential- and they spent so much time with it, that I feel sad that I did not enjoy this movie.  My family ranges in age from 9 to adult and none of us really was jumping up and down with glee at this movie.I think what bothers me is that they attempted to jump on the back of a really good solid story with fabulous potential to keep the attention of an audience and they altered it SO much that they ruined it.If they had taken this story and started fresh with a similar theme but called it a title completely unrelated to the biblical story, perhaps it might not have been so annoying.Each character was so strange and such a mish mash of oddities that they distracted from the story.  We all spent so much time trying to figure out the point of why so many things in this movie were strange that we really did not enjoy it as much as we could have.The flying sheep was rather stupid, Golimyr had to be hit twice with a stone before he was conquered- the characters were all so intricate and unrelated to the story that I found that we spent so much time trying to figure out how it all fit together, that we missed what was being said by the narrator.The story being told in rhyme was a good idea, but it was overshadowed by the overstimulation of the characters- so much was going on with each character that it seemed like a mass of confusion. Being talked at in rhyme, being stimulated by gorgeous color and 3D animation, seeing characters that were so ""out there"" that they did not make any sense, trying to figure out how this related to the original biblical story, and trying to see how this all fit together, was like sensory overload and it tended to make us all burn out and not even care by the end.Honestly, I feel that if they started fresh and used their creativity to introduce the same concepts WITHOUT depending upon the biblical story which is familiar to many, I think that this might have been a bigger success.I was irritated by the many changes that they made in the original story which is far more interesting and fun to explore, yet tried to keep close to the same title.In the real story, David is not even remembered or revered by his family- so much so that when Samuel comes to anoint a king, no one even remembers that he is there- all the other brothers are brought forward first.  His world of living almost estranged from his family with the sheep gives the impression that he had a lonely life- and time to develop character.  Then the mockery when he comes forward to go after the giant of his brothers who are still jealous of him.  The sheer miraculous way that he stands on the faith of his God who taught him to survive impossible odds while being in the fields is what kills the giant- not the stone......This story on the DVD has very little of this flavor to it.  It is so focused on fantasy that is loses the beauty of the underdog conquering and the poignancy of being disliked/undervalued by your own family and yet living to triumph.The effect was like trying to make a 12 oz glass of milk less fattening by adding a gallon of water to it and still calling it milk.I am rating this 3 stars because it does have beautiful colors, some discussion of faith in it, and a slight resemblance to the story it claims to be inspired by.It is not a terrible movie, but it just did not thrill any of us very much either.  Too much crowded into on small span of time, they seemed to lose and powerful focus.Perhaps in the future they can make another movie that might turn out better.  This was a good try anyway.  Hats off to their efforts.",3,Why Not Just Use a Fresh Idea?,1208476800,"04 18, 2008",2008,5423,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'DVD', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'think', 'time', 'someone', 'make',

It is based on the Bible story of David and Goliath, but has popular music and additional fanciful elements, such as flying sheep and mechanical monsters. It is done in a very opulent claymation style that is visually stimulating for even the most jaded viewers. Many of us who are slightly beyond the age of children, grew fond of the claymation style that was developed in the early days of film, but perfected in the fifties and sixties as the ""high tech"" special effect of that time period. It is still sought after today, with the very unique look it imparts to a film, and it is the frame structure of film that went hand in hand with the claymation concept. Usually, the best children's stories are those that also entertain adults, and this is a fine example.

Rodriguez ""The Movie Wizard.com Revi...","[4, 6]","Ok, so lets take this into account before I evaluate the value of ""Davie & Golimyr"": I am a twenty-two year old male, and this movie was not made with me in mind.  For goodness sakes, this is a stop-motion retelling of the Biblical tale of David and Goliath that has gone straight to video.  The biggest star in it is John Schneider of ""Dukes of Hazard"" fame (and for younger fans, of ""Smallville"" fame).  The movie comes in a single disk, cardboard sleeved DVD that includes a set of free stickers from a Nick Jr. show called ""Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!""  I am not the person who is meant to watch this movie.  Chances are if can read this, then you are not the target audience either.  No, this movie is squarely aimed at the toddler crowd.The little tots are not going to make note of many of the things I did.  They are not going to muse over the fact that this re-telling of the famous Bible story is so close to the original, that the makers might as well have just made another David and Goliath.  They aren't going to note that this kind of stop-motion comes off as fairly unsophisticated compared to recent releases of ""Corpse Bride"" and ""Wallice and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit.""  Chances are, they won't even pay attention to any of that.  Trying to bring my own childhood back into play, I believe that kids will enjoy this because the colors are bright, the characters cute, and the story still speaks to the underestimated personality in most young tots.Young ones who are already familiar with the story may get excited that, unlike Goliath, it takes two stones before the mighty Golimyr is taken down.

1132218,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B0011QC9E2,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[2, 3]","Loosely based on the Biblical story of David and Goliath, ""Davie and Golimyr"" takes place in a village inhabited by the Zites.  Young Davie wants nothing more than to be a soldier, but because he's so little, he's laughed out of the arena when he tries to become one in a contest against a gear-driven giant.  When a real giant shows up in the small village, however, no one is willing to challenge him.  No one except for Davie, who uses his faith in God to face Golimyr in a one on one competition for the village.  It's pretty obvious who wins if you're familiar with the Bible story, but I won't spoil the ending for newcomers.The animation in this story is pretty good.  The Zite village comes with a cast of strange characters, from a king with a queen on his back to a flying sheep named Chops.  The story is told in rhyme, and while this could become boring for some, the production crew manages to hold the viewer's interest.  The voice casting was excellent, even John Schneider as Golimyr.As stated before, this is loosely based on the story of David and Goliath.  The Biblical message is still evident, but certain parts of the tale have been altered so that younger children can enjoy this story.  I recommend this tale for children from four to eight years old.  Older children may find it boring, as well as some adults.

The moral is told in rhyme and has a mix of modern and Shakespeare which went over my kid's heads but they enjoyed it all the same.

1132223,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B0011QC9E2,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[8, 8]","Davie & Golimyr tells a story based on David and Goliath from the Bible. This animated short film for young children is charming. Much of the story is told in rhyming verses and the characters and scenery are drawn with great attention to detail. The movie uses great techniques to capture the attention of young children--people wear hats with people living inside of those hats; and there is a windmill that starts if you sneeze! The plot moves along at a good pace and overall the film should hold a young child's attention very well. The film also aims to tell children that with faith in themselves and a high power they can do just about anything. Incredibly, this movie does it all and more in just 45 minutes. Excellent!David, who represents any young child, wants to be all grown up right away so he can be a famous and triumphant warrior for his people, The Zites. Unfortunately, Davie is just too young and too small--five years in a row he fails the test to become a warrior. He's also not exactly cut out to be a warrior; he raises pears and enjoys the company of a sheep for a mascot. Just as things look bleakest for Davie; things also begin to look pretty bleak for the Zites. A giant monster named Golimyr threatens to destroy all the Zites' land and property to dethrone their king and become their ruler.Now since we all know this is based on the Biblical story of David and Goliath, I'm sure you can figure out the ending. However, this film takes things one step further--the giant learns to be kind and the Zites show the importance of forgiving one's mistakes as they take the reformed Golimyr into their midst.I do agree with the reviewer who writes that the animation is somewhat like older animation that we saw in TV specials like Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer and others from decades ago. On the other hand, however, the colors are very pretty and it still works very well.The DVD doesn't really come with any extras; there are some ""sneak peeks"" that work essentially as ads to entice young children to beg their parents to buy them more DVDs.Overall, this fine short animated motion picture teaches the value of standing up for what you believe in and the value of faith in a higher power to enable you to reach your goals. We see Davie never gives up; this is another important lesson to children about life. We also see that bad people can be reformed by kindness and understanding.

These days we need more of it, and not less. The story of David and Goliath is retold so many times and in so many ways that it has become part of our lives irrespective of faiths. One of the highlights of this DVD is hearing the voice of John Schneider who entertained so many fans as Bo Duke in Dukes of Hazard, and later in the WB drama Smallville. The story is told with the same moral theme; through faith in God you can conquer anything in life no matter how small or weak you are.When a giant named Golimyr threatens the village of Zites, their King Sullic calls for a hero to fight the enemy. Davie, a peaceful pear grower with a sling, a sheep named Chop, and strong faith in God volunteers to save the village.

But if you can stand that-this quirky little film has many good points.  Tops on the list is visually the stop animation is stunning, highly detailed, and very imaginative.  Fantastical inventions abound, the costuming of the characters, and funny facial expressions remined this film buff family of some of our favorites likeLabyrinth (Anniversary Edition), andWallace & Gromit - The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (Widescreen Edition).Finally-the faith aspect of the film was well done-gently told for the age group, not ""preachy"" at all, and told with a positive end message:  Forgiveness.  True believers as well as those  open minded ""on the fence"" believers or  even non faith based viewers would enjoy this sweet childrens film that's a great visual change of pace from most modern, CGI based animation.So finally:Art: 5 starsStoryline( because of rhyming): 2 starsFaith storyline: 3.5 starsTotal: 3.5 stars.",3,a fantastical faith filled movie....,1207526400,"04 7, 2008",2008,1634,"['someone', 'who', 'actively', 'away', 'most', 'mainstream', 'Christian', 'media', 'majority', 'way', 'too', 'preachy', ""'re"", 'better', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'hesitant', 'review', 'film', 'Fantasy', 'element', 'boxes', 'artwork', 'intrigued', 'enough', 'give', 'try', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did.My', 'husband', 'eleven', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'watched', 'last', 'night', 'agreed', 'was', 'adorable', 'film-in', 'fact', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'five', 'star', 'review', 'one', 'thing-the', 'story', 'told', 'entirely', 'RHYME-which', 'was', 'slightly', 'annoying', 'films', 'end.As', 'mom', 'who', 'had', 'peripherally', 'listen', 'multiple', 'replayings', 'preschool', 'film', 'past', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'rhyming', 'would', 'be', 'psychosis', 'inducing', 'several', 'days', 'can', 'stand', 'that-this', 'quirky', 'little', 'film', 'many', 'good', 'points', 'Tops', 'list', 'visually', 'stop', 'animation', 'stunning', 'highly', 'detailed', 'very', 'imaginative', 'Fantastical', 'inventions', 'abound', 'costuming', 'characters', 'funny', 'facial', 'expressions', 'remined', 'film', 'buff', 'family', 'favorites', 'likeLabyrinth', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'andWallace', 'Gromit', 'Curse', 'Were-Rabbit', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', '.Finally-the', 'faith', 'aspect', 'film', 'was', 'well', 'done-gently', 'told', 'age', 'group', 'not', 'preachy', 'told', 'positive', 'end', 'message', 'Forgiveness', 'True', 'believers', 'as', 'well', 'open', 'minded', 'fence', 'believers', 'even', 'non', 'faith', 'based', 'viewers', 'would', 'enjoy', 'sweet', 'childrens', 'film', 'great', 'visual', 'change', 'pace', 'most', 'modern', 'CGI', 'based', 'animation.So', 'finally', 'Art', '5', 'starsStoryline', 'rhyming', '2', 'starsFaith', 'storyline', '3.5', 'starsTotal', '3.5', 'stars']",David & Golimyr

Fennell ""pianistcritic""","[1, 1]","Poor ""Davie & Golimyr""; this stop-motion animated video wants so badly to be an installment of Veggie-Tales, but never quite gets there.  The animation itself is pretty impressive, with lots of detail and fluidity, and the voicing of the characters is also top-notch, even though the characters themselves are a bit off-center.  It's the script that causes everything to go off track.  As other reviewers have noted, the entire story is told in rhyme, (with some questionable rhyme schemes, if you want to be picky about it....and I do), and the novelty wears off pretty quick.  My biggest qualm is regarding the writer's choice to tell a slightly-skewed verision of David and Goliath with this video. As other reviewers have asked, why not just re-tell the original story instead of rewriting the Biblical account?  There is such a thing as too much poetic license.*SPOILER ALERT*I was rather aggravated that they chose to have the Davie character actually MISS the first time he throws a stone at the giant, and then finally make a successful shot by hitting the giant with a PEAR instead. (huh??) And while I suppose I can understand the producer's choice of not wanting to show Davie actually killing the giant in a kid's video, the decision to have the giant turn NICE after being hit in the head, was a little ridiculous.*END SPOILER*In short, I'd have a hard time reccomending this video.

1132232,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B0011QC9E2,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","DAVIE & GOLIMYR is a re-telling of the story of David and Goliath from the Bible.  The story told using stop-motion animation and is set within the fantasy world of James Christensen.  The tale begins with a storyteller telling the story to one of his helpers.  The island kingdom of the Zites is preparing for an attack by a terrible giant named Golimyr.  Golimyr has already destroyed several other kingdoms and King Sullic knows the Golimyr will soon come to Zite.  A proclamation is sent throughout the land seeking a champion to fight the giant, but the only person to answer the challenge is the boy pear grower Davie and his sidekick flying sheep, Chops.  Davie is sent home several times, but when Golimyr finally arrives, there is no one to meet his challenge.  Then Davie appears and on faith answers the call.The tale of David and Goliath has been retold in countless ways and the filmmakers take certain liberties with the story, e.g. Davie doesn't kill Golimyr at the end.  Therefore, those who are stickler's for Biblical-inspired or based stories will be disappointed by certain elements of DAVIE & GOLIMYR.The animation isn't the quality of a WALLACE AND GROMIT short, but isn't all that bad and is reminiscent of the stuff done for the Rudolph television Christmas specials.  I was really impressed with the visual images of the story.  The characters, landscapes, and even props are all imaginatively stunning.  I was reminded of the worlds in Jim Henson's LABYRINTH and THE DARK CRYSTAL.The one problem I did have with the story is that everyone speaks in rhyming couplets.  The narrator does, his helper does, and the characters in the story do.  I love Dr. Suess and I actually enjoy reading poetry, but listening to the characters in the story speak in rhyme for forty-five minutes was quite irritating.Overall, DAVIE & GOLIMYR may not be great short film, but with it's imaginative characters its not too bad.  With all the bright colors and rhymed speech, it's a great DVD for kids six and under.",3,For Toddlers and Tykes,1215820800,"07 12, 2008",2008,2020,"['DAVIE', 'GOLIMYR', 're-telling', 'story', 'David', 'Goliath', 'Bible', 'story', 'told', 'using', 'stop-motion', 'animation', 'set', 'fantasy', 'world', 'James', 'Christensen', 'tale', 'storyteller', 'telling', 'story', 'one', 'helpers', 'island', 'kingdom', 'Zites', 'preparing', 'attack', 'terrible', 'giant', 'named', 'Golimyr', 'Golimyr', 'already', 'destroyed', 'several', 'other', 'kingdoms', 'King', 'Sullic', 'Golimyr', 'will', 'soon', 'come', 'Zite', 'proclamation', 'sent', 'land', 'seeking', 'champion', 'fight', 'giant', 'only', 'person', 'answer', 'challenge', 'boy', 'pear', 'grower', 'Davie', 'sidekick', 'flying', 'sheep', 'Chops', 'Davie', 'sent', 'home', 'several', 'times', 'when', 'Golimyr', 'finally', 'one', 'meet', 'challenge', 'Then', 'Davie', 'faith', 'answers', 'call.The', 'tale', 'David', 'Goliath', 'been', 'retold', 'countless', 'ways', 'filmmakers', 'take', 'certain', 'liberties', 'story', 'e.g', 'Davie', ""n't"", 'kill', 'Golimyr', 'end', 'Therefore', 'who', 'are', 'stickler', 'Biblical-inspired', 'based', 'stories', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'certain', 'elements', 'DAVIE', 'GOLIMYR.The', 'animation', ""n't"", 'quality', 'WALLACE', 'AND', 'GROMIT', 'short', ""n't"", 'bad', 'reminiscent', 'stuff', 'done', 'Rudolph', 'television', 'Christmas', 'specials', 'was', 'really', 'impressed', 'visual', 'images', 'story', 'characters', 'landscapes', 'even', 'props', 'are', 'imaginatively', 'stunning', 'was', 'reminded', 'worlds', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'LABYRINTH', 'THE', 'DARK', 'CRYSTAL.The', 'one', 'problem', 'did', 'have', 'story', 'everyone', 'speaks', 'rhyming', 'couplets', 'narrator', 'helper', 'characters', 'story', 'do', 'love', 'Dr.', 'Suess', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'reading', 'poetry', 'listening', 'characters', 'story', 'speak', 'rhyme', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'was', 'quite', 'irritating.Overall', 'DAVIE', 'GOLIMYR', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'great', 'short', 'film', 'imaginative', 'characters', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'bright', 'colors', 'rhymed', 'speech', 'great', 'DVD', 'kids', 'six']",David & Golimyr
