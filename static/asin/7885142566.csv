This film reveals little dialogue, but subtitles are easy to read.There is a shocking beginning with a young girl who jumps off a balcony and we don't know what happened, nothing is said, so after watching the movie, you begin to assume what happened to that young girl.  The setting is a huge mansion of a very wealthy man, his pregnant wife, a little girl, and an elderly housekeeper.  Now, the premise of the film is that a young girl has been hired as the new housemaid who begins an affair with the rich man, who calls the shots and whose only given identity is of a classic pianist.  We don't learn anything else only that the husband exploits the help.However, there isn't anything to indicate a slow building affair, they go right into the sex, lurid sex.  They have no connection, nothing to give the viewer something to build up upon.  It's slam bam, thank you mam.We get a great view of the mansion, nice subtle background music, and we learn a little into the relationship of the elderly housekeeper and how she is indebted to the family.But, other than the sex affair, what is there left?  Not enough punch for me, as much is left to the imagination.  There is moderate nudity with controlled sexual scenes.  But, there is an element of drama and suspense with a shocking twist to the end.

I have not seen this earlier film, but not to worry, the general themes covered in the recent version (English subtitles) have often been explored in cinema land.It's about a young woman, Eun-yi (Do-yeon Jeon), who, due to economic necessity,  becomes a housemaid for a super-wealthy Korean family.  The maid is a pleasant, compassionate woman. Jung-Jae Lee plays the young patriarch of the family. He is used to having his way, or so says his heartless mother-in-law. So, he has his way with Eun-yi, even though he has a young daughter, and his wife is pregnant with twins. Most would say he did not rape the maid, but it's clear that she would lose her job if she did not submit.  Complicating the image of the rich guy using the poor woman is the fact that Eun-yi is attracted to him.I do not want to reveal any more of the story. All of the actors were very sharp. We get a convincing image of the evil deeds of evil people who are rich enough to try to cover their tracks with cash.  Those who equate great wealth with moral bankruptcy will not be disappointed here.One fascinating aspect of the film for me was how the opening sequence strongly suggested the story's conclusion.

488779,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,7885142566,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[104, 111]","The notorious 1960 Korean film ""The Housemaid"" by Kim Ki-young shocked contemporary audiences with its suspenseful descent into depravity and madness.  Taking on a classic (even a cult classic) can be a daunting task.  2010's remake of the same name by Im Sang-soo maintains the same principle characters and much of the plotting, and is able to be much more graphic in nature.  But despite the added nudity and sexuality--the film somehow seems much more subdued.  In fact, I'll issue a cautionary warning.  Billed as a thriller, ""The Housemaid"" really plays as a slow-burn domestic drama.  Still and quiet, anyone expecting edge-of-your-seat excitement will likely be mystified by the thriller descriptive.  That's not to say that there isn't much to recommend this version--I just missed some of the wildness of its predecessor.  More inspired by than an actual remake, this is a glossy and dignified soap opera that maintains a surprising calm amidst increasingly melodramatic plot points.Jeon Do-yeon (a captivating perfromer who won Cannes' Best Actress prize for 2007's Secret Sunshine) plays the titular lead.  Enlisted as a maid and nanny for a wealthy family, she is soon exchanging flirtations with the family patriarch.  Although irresistibly sweet and alluring (probably too much so), she makes some consciously controversial choices.  As a character, she is a bit of a cipher as her excursions into impropriety don't seem to affect her in the slightest.  After a series of bad actions, things start to unravel in the household as an undercurrent of domestic strife affects just about everyone.  With the unfaithful husband, a pregnant wife, a little girl torn, a vengeful mother-in-law, and a put-upon house manager--it is unlikely that anyone will remain unscathed.  Plots and schemes begin to surface, but through all the escalating tension--the film manages to remain inexplicably detached.  The film finishes with an unexpected flourish that is likely to further divide audiences.Visually, the film is very beautiful (man, that's a great house!).  And the primary actors are all especially good.  I have to shout out to the invaluable Yun Yeo-Jung.  As the woman behind the scenes that really runs the household, she steals every scene that she's in.  While the film is ostensibly about the new housemaid, I found this stalwart servant to be the real heart of the movie.  Initially, rigid and imposing--she becomes the moral compass navigating the treacherous waters between the two opposing factions.  A study of class differences and gender roles, this upscale soap opera might not appeal to everyone.  I, personally, thought it lacked a bit of punch and left me more emotionally disengaged than I would have liked.  But it's still a noteworthy film with many great attributes.  Recommended for patient viewers who aren't expecting a thriller!

Basically, some chick gets a job at some wealthy and powerful executive's estate as a nanny/kid-watcher in South Korea. So her job is to watch over the man's pregnant wife and the household, as the wife is about to have a second child. During this time the man feels the need to be unfaithful and ""sow his oats"" but doesnt want to do it with his hideously pregnant wife and has seen too many Smokey The Pokey commercials (Remember kids ""Only you can prevent baby-poking!"") so he starts an illicit affair with the hot young nanny/maid/housebitch. Though, being a powerful executive, who probably does none of the work at his company besides holding meetings, he is quite stupid enough to forgo the use of protection (neither legal, prophylactic, or emergencysaran wrap classic). Of course, this leads the nanny to become pregnant by one overly aggressive supersperm, most undoubtedly the one that had spent all it's genesis training for this exact moment, after seeing many of it's comrades fall. After nanny-gate happens, the wife of executive and her evil Cruella Devil mother discover the nanny's pregnancy and the executive's infidelity. Being that they some GAKGATs (Gangsta Ass Koreans doing Gangsta Ass Things), they rough up that biatch a little bit.They try to coerce her into getting an abortion with some hush money. The nanny refuses after a deep existential and moral pondering about the justification of using her gladiatorial power to choose life or death for another living being, the most pertinent question that perturbs her soul is why should she be Judge Dread to an innocent soul? Nah...I'm just joshing ya! In reality she possibly sees the potential dolla dolla bills yall in the future. So, somehow the wife and the Mother-in-Law then basically poison our po' lil' knocked-up Cinderella with some magic Korean JuJu juice  (that is rumored to be a concoction of 2 parts Hi-fructose corn syrup, purple, 1 part early trimester RU-486 freshly ground, and a shot of SOJU for that kick) in order to  make her lose her baby in the bathtub...in a liquefying bloody mess....while Ace Of Base'sAll That She Wantsplays in the background. Then the crazy biatch nanny goes crazier realizes herGwen Stefani dreamsaint happening. She breaks back into the mansion and proceeds to acts way inane, nonsensical, and in no-way believable if it were real life. This is the point where you can actually start paying attention to the movie.As when you're watching it, it will just makes you say ""WTF?, What type of household is this?"". Seriously, just rent this and watch it for the ending it comes waaay outta left field and you'll be like A) How Big is This House?

He is back with this remake of a 1960 film by Kim Ki-young and it opens sharply, when a maid in a wealthy household leaps to her death in the city's business district.  The search for a replacement begins and Jeon Do-yeon, South Korea's best known actress, gets the role of Lee Eun-yi.When the master of the house (Lee Jung-jae) and the new maid succumb to primal passion, (and I note here that the language of their promiscuity is more explicit than its visual depiction) Sang-soo devotes the rest of the film trying to determine the consequences.  Lee's roommate tries to bring the maid to her senses, but the large paychecks corrupt the moral vision of both women.  The senior servant in the household, Mrs. Cho, (Youn Yuh jung) gives an impressive performance with her worldliness, as well as her signature comment, repeated several times in the film, namely that we live in a world with the R.U.N.S.  Revolting, Ugly, Nauseating and Shameless.  Sometimes it's a funny comment, by the end of the film, it's also accurate.Lee Hyung Deok's camera work throughout the film is stellar and in Jeon Do-yeon, Director Sang-soo has an actress who moves from searing inquiry to calm acceptance in two or three frames.
