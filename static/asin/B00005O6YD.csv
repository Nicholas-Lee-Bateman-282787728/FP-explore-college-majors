I was watching Animal Planet and they mentioned Kangaroos and for some reason, my favorite childhood movie ""Dot and the Kangaroo"" popped up in my mind. I didn't even think that Amazon sold it! I'm so happy! :)Guys, this is a great movie for kids. It obviously still has an impact on me because 24 years later, I'm now 28, and I still remember the film like I watched yesterday.

Could have been much better if it was a restored print. Even having some background on how the movie was actually done would have been neat to see.I thought that this movie was a brakthrough film long before Roger Rabbit. It was like Pete's Dragon in a way... An animal helping it's human friend get out of trouble...The scenes where she cares for the kangaroo were touching.. Even when the kangaroo went home I cried like crazy... It touches on feelings that people experience when a good friend leaves..I have fond memories of little Dot finding her way home and even after all these years, I still cry...

I still remember it fondly to this day.This is a cute tale of a young girl and a kangaroo.  It's a very enjoyable story about friendship, although there are some scary moments involving dingos and the mythical Bunyip, whom I always called ""Bun Lip"" for some unknown reason.I think this is a great movie for parents to watch with their kids, far better than any over-commercialized Disney garbage you might find.
