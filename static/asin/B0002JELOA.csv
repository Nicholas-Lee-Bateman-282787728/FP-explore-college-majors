837260,A2D4NMCM6JYJ98,B0002JELOA,Lynn,"[14, 15]","Loved the video, although it should've been longer.  I would have loved to see more of the Jackson Five footage, the complete performances.  This video shows clips of footage.  I must admit it took me back some years, but it was well worth it.  I allowed my family to view the video and they loved it as well, but wished it would've been longer.  This brought back some good time memories.  ""I Think About The Good Times.""  I would ask that each of you purchase this video as a collectors item to reflect back on the good old times, and most of all to support the Jackson Family.  I hope they will come out with a video of the Jackson Five showing full tv shows and concerts they did back in the day.  Thank you Marlon for doing such a fantastic job on the narration.  Also, I thought the interview Marlon's daughter did with the Jackson Five plus Randy was great.Lynn, okc",4,America's First Family of Music,1262908800,"01 8, 2010",2010,873,"['Loved', 'video', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'longer', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'more', 'Jackson', 'Five', 'footage', 'complete', 'performances', 'video', 'clips', 'footage', 'must', 'admit', 'took', 'back', 'years', 'was', 'well', 'worth', 'allowed', 'family', 'view', 'video', 'loved', 'as', 'well', 'wished', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'longer', 'brought', 'back', 'good', 'time', 'memories', 'Think', 'Good', 'Times', 'would', 'ask', 'purchase', 'video', 'collectors', 'item', 'reflect', 'back', 'good', 'old', 'times', 'most', 'support', 'Jackson', 'Family', 'hope', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'video', 'Jackson', 'Five', 'showing', 'full', 'tv', 'shows', 'concerts', 'did', 'back', 'day', 'Thank', 'Marlon', 'doing', 'fantastic', 'job', 'narration', 'Also', 'thought', 'interview', 'Marlon', 'daughter', 'did', 'Jackson', 'Five', 'Randy', 'was', 'great.Lynn', 'okc']",N/A
