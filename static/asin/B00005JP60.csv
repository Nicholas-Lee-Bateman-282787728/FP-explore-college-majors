At core it is about an arranged marriage but more so it is about working on and growing relationship, making it work and deepening the love engendered through change and loss. It is also about migration, raising family and developing a life that at birth was not imagined and a return to what is important and it is not necessarily money, fame and finding your soul partner in serial episodes. It also effectively tells the story of the intergenerational children caught between old/new and making sense and finding place in their own world.

Like many immigrants coming to America, there is a draw to the freedoms and folkways of our country while trying to retain the best of the culture they have left behind.  Ashoke and his wife, Anshima, leave India to find adventure in the U.S.  Starting a family, he names his son Gogol after a friend's favorite Russian author, Gogol Nikolai.  Like many second generation Americans, Gogol (Kal Penn of 'Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle'Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle (Unrated Edition) (UMD Mini For PSP)tries to fit in socially with his friends. He listens to Pearl Jam, immerses himself in university life, and socializes with his peers.  Despite all his company, his name causes him great insecurity and some insensitive jokes.  Against his parent's wishes, he changes it to Nick and dates Maxine, an American girl of Northern European descent.  However, changes in his life make him embrace his ancestry more enthusiastically.Later, he dates an American who shares his Indian heritage only to find this brings complications as well.  When his father's health falters, he finds himself drawing near to his family.  Before his father's health fails, the family goes to India where Gogol discovers the Taj Mahal and the modest residences of relatives in India.  It is only later that he uncovers the real treasures of his thoughtful name and the wisdom of his father's words, ""There are no accidents.""  Gogol must live with all these dichotomies with America his home, but India his family`s tradition--and the family members who are scattered about and affected by life's changes.  How he chooses between whom he dates and where he lives and draws meaning in life is a revelation for us as well.Sometimes lost in translation, the gentle humor and heartwarming development of the movie is absorbing and varied enough to keep one's interest.

Their son Gogol (Kal Penn) is caught in a culture gap between his parents' old traditions of India and the clashing modern ways of the United States.I have to admit I didn't know much about Indian culture prior to seeing this film; not the way I knew about the Japanese, the Chinese, the French, and Italians, anyway. It was easy to relate to the family's alienation and feelings of loneliness. On top of the generation gap between their parents and them, Gogol (whose father named after Russian writer Nikolai Gogol) and his sister Sonia struggle to understand their parents' take on life. The film skillfully deals with life's most important issues and stays in touch with the essence of the characters. The cinematography is beautiful and the performances are heartfelt. Kal Penn sheds his stoner image from Harold and Kumar to deliver his most poignant performance to date. The film does tend to drag a bit in certain places, but the overall experience is an enjoyable one.Well written characters and script, great actors, and a talented director make this one a must-see for aficionados of foreign and art-house films. If you've always wondered what it's like to come from a different country and be immersed in a society such as America, then see this film.

It began when a young Indian man traveled back to India to find a wife. They had two children, Gogul (Kal Penn) and a girl Sonia. The lived in New Jersey and during the growing up the kids in school really picked on them for being Indian, especially Gogul for having not only a very unusual name but because he had the name of a ""crazy"" writer. When they traveled to India for 90 days they really came to know their heritage and the traditions they rebeled against from their mother and father. The death of Gogul's father is what really brough them together and Gogul to really understand and want to be the Indian he was born. He married a Bengali women which really made his mother happy because he was also Bengali and in their culture it is what is ""suppose"" to happen.

Lahiri's novel is written at times in the matter of a ""just the facts"" accounting.  Nair, however, has succeeded in unearthing the emotional high points of the book and staging them in stirring fashion.  Two scenes stand out in particular: the drama of the opening train scene and the interaction between passangers Ashoke and Ghosh are a heart-stopping beginning to the film; and the scene in which Ashoke finally reveals to Gogol the symbolic relevance of his name raises goose-bumps even thinking about it.  Great stuff from Mira Nair.  Between this work and 'Monsoon Wedding,' she's created two of my favorites.The film's real revelation is the acting ability of Kal Penn.  Previously known and typecast only for stoner-like roles, Nair took a flyer here on Penn and came up a winner.  He's brilliant.  He pretty much has to be, as he's in just about every scene.

Though not significantly altered from the novel, the movie's script provides a distinctly different treatment to the way characters are depicted. As a consequence, Namesake the movie, is in many ways is more of a depiction of the life and experiences of Ashima Ganguli than that of Gogol Ganguli (the person who is meant to be the Namesake). Nonetheless, the movie is an insightful portrayal of a lifecycle of an immigrant family - including some brilliant scenes and some tender moments of exquisite emotional glory.The acting of Tabu (as Ashima Ganguli) and Irfan Khan (as Ashok Ganguli) is of a very high standard.  Their comfort in the role of immigrant parents is numbingly realistic. Irfan Khan stands out for bringing a typical immigrant father's character almost live to the screen. He is aware of his children's needs for different perspectives and practices than his own, but at the same time he is uncomfortable at their departure from values he holds dearest to his heart. In her portrayal of an immigrant Indian wife and mother, Tabu has attained excellence in her typical style.Along with these outstanding characters, coexists a characterization that is less appealing than you would expect from a Mira Nair movie's protagonist. Gogol Ganguli's dilemmas and struggle for an identity have been dealt with in rather brief scenes, and the themes have not emerged well. That is why his reasons for refusing a girl with whom he was happy, and instead loving and marrying a girl, who eventually hurt him, are obvious only if you have an immigrant perspective. That is why the concluding scenes of the movie do not seem consistent with his character - it seems that the pursuer of an American value system in him concedes to his racial roots, but the transition is rather sudden, even mildly abrupt. The enigma around his characterization is the biggest drawback of the movie. After all, the Namesake - Gogol Ganguli - is expected to rise above the rest and convey a bit more.",3,Insightful portrayal of immigrant life,1179187200,"05 15, 2007",2007,2145,"['Jhumpa', 'Lahiri', 'international', 'bestseller', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'Namesake', 'not', 'same', 'league', 'book', 'compelling', 'work', 'art', 'own', 'rights', 'not', 'significantly', 'altered', 'novel', 'movie', 'script', 'distinctly', 'different', 'treatment', 'way', 'characters', 'are', 'depicted', 'consequence', 'Namesake', 'movie', 'many', 'ways', 'more', 'depiction', 'life', 'experiences', 'Ashima', 'Ganguli', 'Gogol', 'Ganguli', 'person', 'who', 'meant', 'be', 'Namesake', 'Nonetheless', 'movie', 'insightful', 'portrayal', 'lifecycle', 'immigrant', 'family', 'including', 'brilliant', 'scenes', 'tender', 'moments', 'exquisite', 'emotional', 'glory.The', 'acting', 'Tabu', 'Ashima', 'Ganguli', 'Irfan', 'Khan', 'Ashok', 'Ganguli', 'very', 'high', 'standard', 'comfort', 'role', 'immigrant', 'parents', 'numbingly', 'realistic', 'Irfan', 'Khan', 'out', 'bringing', 'typical', 'immigrant', 'father', 'character', 'almost', 'live', 'screen', 'aware', 'children', 'needs', 'different', 'perspectives', 'practices', 'own', 'same', 'time', 'uncomfortable', 'departure', 'values', 'dearest', 'heart', 'portrayal', 'immigrant', 'Indian', 'wife', 'mother', 'Tabu', 'attained', 'excellence', 'typical', 'style.Along', 'outstanding', 'characters', 'characterization', 'less', 'appealing', 'would', 'expect', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'movie', 'protagonist', 'Gogol', 'Ganguli', 'dilemmas', 'struggle', 'identity', 'have', 'been', 'dealt', 'rather', 'brief', 'scenes', 'themes', 'have', 'not', 'emerged', 'well', 'why', 'reasons', 'refusing', 'girl', 'whom', 'was', 'happy', 'instead', 'loving', 'marrying', 'girl', 'who', 'eventually', 'hurt', 'are', 'obvious', 'only', 'have', 'immigrant', 'perspective', 'why', 'concluding', 'scenes', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'consistent', 'character', 'pursuer', 'American', 'value', 'system', 'concedes', 'racial', 'roots', 'transition', 'rather', 'sudden', 'even', 'mildly', 'abrupt', 'enigma', 'characterization', 'biggest', 'drawback', 'movie', 'Namesake', 'Gogol', 'Ganguli', 'expected', 'rise', 'rest', 'convey', 'bit', 'more']",The Namesake

Her writing is beautiful and fluid, and her stories flow beautifully.This movie, unfortunately, does not follow her example. The story is told well, but the acting is just horrible. Kal Penn is absolutely terrible. There's a reason that he's famous for Harold and Kumar-like roles. Every line that he delivers sounds exactly the same (nasal and overly dramatic), and his teenage angst is completely unbelievable. Whoever it is that plays his sister is equally bad (I'm sure that's why I've never seen her in anything else). And good lord, Zuleikha Robinson is horrible also - her only saving grace is that she is stunningly beautiful. The three of them overacting every single scene like they do is almost painful to watch. In fact, Gogol's first girlfriend in the movie, Maxine (played by Jacinda Barrett), is a better actress than them all, and she only had a minor part in the film. It was almost as if they wanted to cast the worst actors they could find.However - I gave this film 4 stars because the actors that portray Gogol's parents, Irrfan Khan and Indian actress Tabu, are absolutely breathtaking in their roles as a traditional Indian couple. The chemistry between those two characters is gorgeous to watch. Seeing them together was worth watching the rest of the crappy movie. Tabu is so, so beautiful, I can't believe I've never seen her in anything before.If you really want the experience of this story, please read the book.

Even though the film spans 25 years, I still felt a keen sense of what these characters were about, despite the fact that they grew and changed so much during the film, much of it off the screen.The film shows problems common to many immigrant families in which the children do not hold the culture in the same reverence as the parents do...but with a fresh look. There is no sense of the director making accusations or judgements. We see events through the perspective of different family members --- which gives the viewer a sense of what would be felt by anyone, in any cultural or ethnic group.Understated and not at all melodramatic, THE NAMESAKE gives an honest portrayal of a family that is coping with assimilation while trying to maintain its cultural heritage.Every actor did a marvelous job, sometimes conveying great emotions with just a glance, no words needed.

645671,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B00005JP60,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[13, 16]","Films with universal themes run great risks. Mostly this risk entails descending into that pit known as cliche. Many films have done it and fallen victim, but THE NAMESAKE uses its universal theme to great advantage, never disguising what it is and how important it can be.The theme is family and how vital they are to our core existence. They shape every part of us, from childhood on, for better or worse. They create a sense of belonging, even when we're apart, even when separated by oceans. They give us our early identity, and even our names.Most of us don't think about how tough it is to name a human being and how we lug that title around with us for the rest of our lives. But in The Namesake, director Mira Nair ( of MONSOON WEDDING fame) gives us Gogol Ganguli, a name of substance and importance, but not necessarily important to its owner.The Namesake is a tri-generational story of a Bangladeshi family. The film starts with the beautiful Indian singing of Ashima (Tabu). Her initial goal in life is to become a great artist/singer. But family concerns override her plans as she returns home to find a marriage arrangement being put forth for her. Her parents introduce her to her future husband, Ashoke (Irfan Khan), an architect who's been studying and living in America. The marriage takes place and Ashima accompanies her new husband to New York (""Half a world away""). She immediately begins missing her family but her forlorn attitude is whisked aside as Ashoke teaches her the ways of the City. She becomes pregnant with her first child, Gogol. The naming is tricky because normally it is done by an elder from within the family (all of whom are still in India). So Ashoke names him after one of his favorite authors (Nicholas ""Gogol"", a famous Russian writer). Gogol bares the name with disdain, never fully realizing its importance (one of Nicholas Gogol's books actually saved Gogol's father's life after a fatal train accident in India many years before). Gogol eventually changes his name to Nick, thus ending his family's tradition of keeping an appropriate Indian name.It is this Americanization that is most troubling throughout the film. It invades the very fabric of what Gogol's family represents. Although not entirely without merit (America does give him a good education and a nice job), the culture of his parents seems stilted and uncool. As Gogol (and eventually his sister) grow into adulthood, they search for love in America, and find it via Americans. This is also another blow to Ashima and Ashoke (Gogol's mother and father). Americans live in the fast lane and often have to choose between one spouse's family over the other. This comes into sharp contrast as Gogol begins dating a beautiful blonde American named Maxine (Jacinda Barrett, POSEIDON). Maxine's pull is strong and forces Gogol to drift farther away from his roots. His parents call and call but never hear back. It takes a devastating family event to get Gogol back on track and it is this that gives the film its emotional heft. Tear-jerking and non-forced, this event was played perfectly and surprised everyone in the audience (all the movie patrons gasped around me when it occurred, a true tribute to this film's masterful weaving of the family theme).The movie's arc is also well done. It ends just as it begins, with the focus on understanding family and what it means to move on when the time comes, but to never forget where you've come from.",5,Sometimes Universal Themes Work Wonders,1175040000,"03 28, 2007",2007,3460,"['Films', 'universal', 'themes', 'run', 'great', 'risks', 'Mostly', 'risk', 'descending', 'pit', 'known', 'cliche', 'Many', 'films', 'have', 'done', 'fallen', 'victim', 'THE', 'NAMESAKE', 'universal', 'theme', 'great', 'advantage', 'never', 'disguising', 'what', 'how', 'important', 'can', 'be.The', 'theme', 'family', 'how', 'vital', 'are', 'core', 'existence', 'shape', 'part', 'childhood', 'better', 'worse', 'create', 'sense', 'belonging', 'even', 'when', ""'re"", 'apart', 'even', 'when', 'separated', 'oceans', 'give', 'early', 'identity', 'even', 'names.Most', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'how', 'tough', 'name', 'human', 'being', 'how', 'lug', 'title', 'rest', 'lives', 'Namesake', 'director', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'MONSOON', 'WEDDING', 'fame', 'Gogol', 'Ganguli', 'name', 'substance', 'importance', 'not', 'necessarily', 'important', 'owner.The', 'Namesake', 'tri-generational', 'story', 'Bangladeshi', 'family', 'film', 'beautiful', 'Indian', 'singing', 'Ashima', 'Tabu', 'initial', 'goal', 'life', 'become', 'great', 'artist/singer', 'family', 'concerns', 'plans', 'home', 'find', 'marriage', 'arrangement', 'being', 'put', 'forth', 'parents', 'introduce', 'future', 'husband', 'Ashoke', 'Irfan', 'Khan', 'architect', 'who', 'been', 'studying', 'living', 'America', 'marriage', 'place', 'Ashima', 'new', 'husband', 'New', 'York', 'world', 'away', 'immediately', 'missing', 'family', 'forlorn', 'attitude', 'whisked', 'aside', 'Ashoke', 'ways', 'City', 'pregnant', 'first', 'child', 'Gogol', 'naming', 'tricky', 'normally', 'done', 'elder', 'family', 'whom', 'are', 'still', 'India', 'So', 'Ashoke', 'names', 'one', 'favorite', 'authors', 'Nicholas', 'Gogol', 'famous', 'Russian', 'writer', 'Gogol', 'name', 'disdain', 'never', 'fully', 'realizing', 'importance', 'one', 'Nicholas', 'Gogol', 'books', 'actually', 'saved', 'Gogol', 'father', 'life', 'fatal', 'train', 'accident', 'India', 'many', 'years', 'Gogol', 'eventually', 'name', 'Nick', 'thus', 'ending', 'family', 'tradition', 'keeping', 'appropriate', 'Indian', 'name.It', 'Americanization', 'most', 'troubling', 'film', 'very', 'fabric', 'what', 'Gogol', 'family', 'not', 'entirely', 'merit', 'America', 'give', 'good', 'education', 'nice', 'job', 'culture', 'parents', 'stilted', 'uncool', 'Gogol', 'eventually', 'sister', 'grow', 'adulthood', 'search', 'love', 'America', 'find', 'Americans', 'also', 'blow', 'Ashima', 'Ashoke', 'Gogol', 'mother', 'father', 'Americans', 'live', 'fast', 'lane', 'often', 'have', 'choose', 'one', 'spouse', 'family', 'other', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'Gogol', 'dating', 'beautiful', 'blonde', 'American', 'named', 'Maxine', 'Jacinda', 'Barrett', 'POSEIDON', 'Maxine', 'pull', 'strong', 'forces', 'Gogol', 'drift', 'farther', 'away', 'roots', 'parents', 'call', 'call', 'never', 'hear', 'back', 'devastating', 'family', 'event', 'get', 'Gogol', 'back', 'track', 'film', 'emotional', 'heft', 'Tear-jerking', 'non-forced', 'event', 'was', 'played', 'perfectly', 'surprised', 'everyone', 'audience', 'movie', 'patrons', 'gasped', 'when', 'occurred', 'true', 'tribute', 'film', 'masterful', 'weaving', 'family', 'theme', 'movie', 'arc', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'just', 'focus', 'understanding', 'family', 'what', 'move', 'when', 'time', 'never', 'forget', 'where', ""'ve"", 'come']",The Namesake

The most common theme in Indian films is the importance of family and loving ones parents. Though this is an American film the storyline and message are purely Indian in content and delivery.While the plot is well constructed and imbued with pathos and depth, I found the film to be a little slow in development and somewhat short on emotional peak moments necessary to keep the audience fully involved. The real strength of the film is in the wonderful performances by Tabu and Ifran Khan as the newly married couple who leave India to embrace a new life in America. They are magical together and their understated yet profound performances are a joy to watch as they journey through life tied by a bound of unspoken love slowly unfolding in the years following their arranged marriage. Also starring in `Namesake' is the popular Kal Penn as their American born son Gogol.Solid production values, excellent wistful soundtrack, poignant message and life lessons topped off by a number of excellent performances make `Namesake' a film well worth investing 122 minutes of your time.",4,"""Embrace The New, Don't Forget The Old"" ~ Living Life Without Borders",1197072000,"12 8, 2007",2007,1261,"['release', 'Namesake', 'movie', 'living', 'life', 'embracing', 'diversity', 'human', 'experience', 'forgetting', 'family', 'cultural', 'roots', 'sprang', 'most', 'common', 'theme', 'Indian', 'films', 'importance', 'family', 'loving', 'ones', 'parents', 'American', 'film', 'storyline', 'message', 'are', 'purely', 'Indian', 'content', 'delivery.While', 'plot', 'well', 'constructed', 'imbued', 'pathos', 'depth', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'little', 'slow', 'development', 'somewhat', 'short', 'emotional', 'peak', 'moments', 'necessary', 'keep', 'audience', 'fully', 'involved', 'real', 'strength', 'film', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'Tabu', 'Ifran', 'Khan', 'newly', 'married', 'couple', 'who', 'leave', 'India', 'embrace', 'new', 'life', 'America', 'are', 'magical', 'together', 'understated', 'yet', 'profound', 'performances', 'are', 'joy', 'watch', 'journey', 'life', 'tied', 'bound', 'unspoken', 'love', 'slowly', 'unfolding', 'years', 'following', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'Also', 'starring', 'Namesake', 'popular', 'Kal', 'Penn', 'American', 'born', 'son', 'Gogol.Solid', 'production', 'values', 'excellent', 'wistful', 'soundtrack', 'poignant', 'message', 'life', 'lessons', 'topped', 'off', 'number', 'excellent', 'performances', 'make', 'Namesake', 'film', 'well', 'investing', '122', 'minutes', 'time']",The Namesake

The film is joyous without being artificial and tear-jerking without being melodramatic.The performances are subtle, textured, and as close to perfect as you will ever find. I guess the best compliment I can pay this little film is that my wife and I were still talking about it days after we watched it together, reliving our favorite moments. There is far more to discuss than one might think. There is multi-generational misunderstanding, cross-cultural confusion, a lifelong love story, and ultimately, the way these various issues help transform a confused young man into a mature and confident adult.There are already dozens of positives reviews here that outline the plot and the performances, and I really have nothing new to add to those comments.

Their son, named Gogol, grows into a smart but slightly rebellious teen-ager who often feels stiflied by his parent's focus on tradition and family unity. He gets engaged to an American girl, Maxine, but they break up after she responds selfishly to the degree of mourning Gogol experiences following the death of his father. Gogol later ends up marrying a very modern and French influenced Indian girl named Moushumi. But once again the relationship doesn't work out. The movie ends with Gogol's mother deciding to sell the family home in America and return to India.My favorite parts of the movie are the scenes set in India. I spent 4 months travelling there as a college student and the film does a great job of capturing the country in all it's intense, colorful and bustling glory. As in several of her previous movies, director Mira Nair is interested in exploring how Indians are affected by modernization and Western influence while still trying to maintain their own traditions and sense of cultural authenticity. The movie is rather slow paced and with a serious tone. Personally I preferred Nair's more celebratory and humor filled past movies such as ""Monsoon Wedding"" and ""Mississippi Masala"".

Pawl ""Dani""","[3, 3]","THE NAMESAKE, a beautiful film about the delicate ties and tensions between family, culture and identity, is beautifully brought to the screen by the great Indian director, Mira Nair.  This story, adapted from a novel, has moments of warm and infectious humor, as well as intense scenes of cultural displacement and alienation.  What is especially compelling is the running theme and great significance paid to the Indian custom of one's nickname and ""good name"" (AKA the name with which most of the world addresses you).  This subject ties into other aspects of the struggle to assimilate and come to know one's self in a culture quite alien and unfamiliar, and is beautifully illustrated in the relationships between East and West, conveyed in the film.Ashoke Ganguli (soulfully played by Irfan Khan) is a young electrical engineer, who returns home to India, to meet and be married to beautiful Ashima (Tabu).  Together, they make their home in Queens, New York, which provides great culture shock for Ashima, who has never been away from India before, and must adjust to the cold climate and unlimited supply of gas powered heating, in their modest apartment.  Soon, their family begins to grow, with the arrival of their son, Gogol (Kal Penn) and daughter, Sonia (Sahira Nair).  ""Gogol"" is their son's nickname, while Nikhil is his, more formal, good name.  Gogol sticks with his nickname, in spite of the merciless teasing he endures in school, and doesn't take on the name ""Nikhil"" or ""Nick,"" until he is out of high school.  This name change is a significant change for the young man, torn between his Westernized self identity, and the Indian identity of his parents.  On the way, he searches for his true identity, independent of his parents and the life he knew before, in his relationship with his White girlfriend, Maxine (Jacinda Barrett), and then his Bengali girlfriend, Moushumi (Zuleikha Robinson).Mira Nair does a fantastic job telling this complex and engaging story.  I particularly took notice of (and loved) her attention to distinctive cinematography, in the scenes shot in the United States, versus India.  While we see rich colors and flowing light, while the family is on holiday there for the summer, the sky and surroundings are grey and dismal once the Gangulis' have settled in Queens.

645682,ADKHI1TUGAX4,B00005JP60,E. Anderson,"[0, 0]","The Namesake is the newest film by Mira Nair who directed Monsoon Wedding and Vanity Fair. The film centers around an Indian family living in New York. The parents Ashoke Ganguli (Irfan Khan) and Ashima Ganguli (Tabu) immigrated to American after their parents arranged to have the couple married. The story begins prior to Ashoke and Ashima's wedding when Ashoke is going to visit his grandfather via a train which ends up in a horrific accident, leaving Ashoke a changed man. For awhile the film focuses on the young couple's life in New York which was obviously a lonely time for Ashima since she did not know anybody in the US. The couple ends up having two children, Gogol and Sonia and they move out into the 'burbs.When Gogol (Kal Penn) gets older, the adolescent angst kicks in especially during high school when his high school peers teases him for his unusual name. This soon leads to his conflict between his parents' traditional Indian heritage and his Americanized upbringing. For awhile Gogol rebels against his parents' Indian roots but when tragedy befalls the family, his Indian roots is awakened through self-realization.The film was excellent. The writing was strong and every compelling. The conflict between America and India in Gogol was very convincing. After seeing this film, I am quite interested in reading the book that this film was based on.Kal Penn is more known for his goofy roles like in National Lampoon's Van Wilder and Harold and Kumar goes to White Castle. I recently saw him on an episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit this year in a darker, sinister role. I thought he was quite good as an actor. I hope to see him in roles like Gogol and maybe make less crappy comedy films like Van Wilder.",4,Very enjoyable,1174780800,"03 25, 2007",2007,1738,"['Namesake', 'newest', 'film', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'who', 'directed', 'Monsoon', 'Wedding', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'film', 'centers', 'Indian', 'family', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'parents', 'Ashoke', 'Ganguli', 'Irfan', 'Khan', 'Ashima', 'Ganguli', 'Tabu', 'immigrated', 'American', 'parents', 'arranged', 'have', 'couple', 'married', 'story', 'prior', 'Ashoke', 'Ashima', 'wedding', 'when', 'Ashoke', 'going', 'visit', 'grandfather', 'train', 'up', 'horrific', 'accident', 'leaving', 'Ashoke', 'changed', 'man', 'film', 'young', 'couple', 'life', 'New', 'York', 'was', 'obviously', 'lonely', 'time', 'Ashima', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'anybody', 'US', 'couple', 'up', 'having', 'two', 'children', 'Gogol', 'Sonia', 'move', 'out', ""'burbs.When"", 'Gogol', 'Kal', 'Penn', 'older', 'adolescent', 'angst', 'kicks', 'especially', 'high', 'school', 'when', 'high', 'school', 'peers', 'unusual', 'name', 'soon', 'conflict', 'parents', 'traditional', 'Indian', 'heritage', 'Americanized', 'upbringing', 'awhile', 'Gogol', 'rebels', 'parents', 'Indian', 'roots', 'when', 'tragedy', 'family', 'Indian', 'roots', 'awakened', 'self-realization.The', 'film', 'was', 'excellent', 'writing', 'was', 'strong', 'compelling', 'conflict', 'America', 'India', 'Gogol', 'was', 'very', 'convincing', 'seeing', 'film', 'am', 'quite', 'interested', 'reading', 'book', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'on.Kal', 'Penn', 'more', 'known', 'goofy', 'roles', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'Harold', 'Kumar', 'White', 'Castle', 'recently', 'saw', 'episode', 'Law', 'Order', 'Special', 'Victims', 'Unit', 'year', 'darker', 'sinister', 'role', 'thought', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'actor', 'hope', 'see', 'roles', 'Gogol', 'maybe', 'make', 'less', 'crappy', 'comedy', 'films', 'Van', 'Wilder']",The Namesake
645683,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JP60,Ed Uyeshima,"[24, 26]","Meticulously observed and wonderfully heartfelt, this time-spanning 2007 family dramedy represents a return to form for director Mira Nair, who faltered somewhat with 2004's elaborate but lugubrious ""Vanity Fair"". This one is also a literary adaptation but this time from a contemporary best-seller by Jhumpa Lahiri, who wrote an emotionally drawn story about first generation Bengali immigrants to the United States and their U.S.-born children. It's an intricate book full of careful nuances, and Nair, along with screenwriter Sooni Taraporevala, captures most of them in a most loving manner. The story speaks fluently to the universal struggle to extricate ourselves from the obligation of family and a perceived enslavement to the past. Nair and Taraporevala manage to transcend the necessarily episodic nature of the novel to make it an involving journey toward self-acceptance.The film initially focuses on Ashoke Ganguli and his arranged marriage to Ashima, a classically trained singer. The young couple move from Calcutta in 1977 to Queens in order for him to pursue his career as an electrical engineer. The adjustment is difficult, especially for Ashima in assimilating into the often cold U.S. culture, and these quiet scenes show a keen eye for subtle observation. They quickly have two children in succession, son Gogol and daughter Sonia. Gogol's name is the key plot point as he was inadvertently after Ashoke's favorite writer, Nikholai Gogol, and this is revealed to have greater significance as the story unfolds. Eventually, the film switches the perspective to Gogol's as he grows up, changes his name to Nikhil and starts his life as a yuppie architect in Manhattan.At the same, the film does not abandon Ashoke and Ashima as they remain significant figures in shaping Gogol's destiny, especially as the impact of a tragic turn brings unexpected changes. The cathartic aspect of these scenes is what makes the film powerful. Moreover, with her filmmaking experience in her native India and the U.S., Nair brings a seamless fluency to both locales. The movie falters a bit toward the end when it starts to ramble and feel pat, but the story's old world gravitas rescues it just in time. Beforehand I was convinced Kal Penn would be the spoiler in this film, but he gives a sharp, dedicated performance as Gogol. Poised to be taken seriously as an actor even amid his White Castle and Van Wilder movies, he seems a bit exaggerated only in the early teenage scenes which recall those other movies.However, it is the superb work of Irfan Khan and Tabu as his parents that make the film soar. Both bring a level of assurance and compassion that ground the film completely, especially Tabu who makes the seemingly modest character arc of Ashima really striking. Playing yet another variation of the spoiled American girl, Jacinda Barrett again proves how fearless an actress she can be in exposing the vanity and ignorance of Maxine, Gogol's first serious girlfriend. As Moushumi, the Bengali girl who comes with the family's seal of approval, Zuleikha Robinson has a ripe presence to match her character's aspiring worldliness. Cinematographer Frederick Elmes and production designer Stephanie Carroll provide masterful work in capturing the diverse flavors of the different locales. This film is for anyone who has struggled to forge his or her own identity only to find the need to embrace the past, especially those of us who have parents who displayed the courage to move from their native lands.",5,Truly Universal and Cathartic Adaptation of Lahiri's Time-Spanning Novel,1173484800,"03 10, 2007",2007,3518,"['Meticulously', 'observed', 'wonderfully', 'heartfelt', 'time-spanning', '2007', 'family', 'dramedy', 'return', 'form', 'director', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'who', 'faltered', 'somewhat', '2004', 'elaborate', 'lugubrious', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'one', 'also', 'literary', 'adaptation', 'time', 'contemporary', 'best-seller', 'Jhumpa', 'Lahiri', 'who', 'wrote', 'emotionally', 'drawn', 'story', 'first', 'generation', 'Bengali', 'immigrants', 'United', 'States', 'U.S.-born', 'children', 'intricate', 'book', 'full', 'careful', 'nuances', 'Nair', 'screenwriter', 'Sooni', 'Taraporevala', 'most', 'most', 'loving', 'manner', 'story', 'fluently', 'universal', 'struggle', 'extricate', 'obligation', 'family', 'perceived', 'enslavement', 'past', 'Nair', 'Taraporevala', 'manage', 'transcend', 'necessarily', 'episodic', 'nature', 'novel', 'make', 'involving', 'journey', 'self-acceptance.The', 'film', 'initially', 'Ashoke', 'Ganguli', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'Ashima', 'classically', 'trained', 'singer', 'young', 'couple', 'move', 'Calcutta', '1977', 'Queens', 'order', 'pursue', 'career', 'electrical', 'engineer', 'adjustment', 'difficult', 'especially', 'Ashima', 'assimilating', 'often', 'cold', 'U.S.', 'culture', 'quiet', 'scenes', 'show', 'keen', 'eye', 'subtle', 'observation', 'quickly', 'have', 'two', 'children', 'succession', 'son', 'Gogol', 'daughter', 'Sonia', 'Gogol', 'name', 'key', 'plot', 'point', 'was', 'inadvertently', 'Ashoke', 'favorite', 'writer', 'Nikholai', 'Gogol', 'revealed', 'have', 'greater', 'significance', 'story', 'unfolds', 'Eventually', 'film', 'perspective', 'Gogol', 'up', 'name', 'Nikhil', 'life', 'yuppie', 'architect', 'Manhattan.At', 'same', 'film', 'not', 'abandon', 'Ashoke', 'Ashima', 'remain', 'significant', 'figures', 'shaping', 'Gogol', 'destiny', 'especially', 'impact', 'tragic', 'turn', 'unexpected', 'changes', 'cathartic', 'aspect', 'scenes', 'what', 'film', 'powerful', 'Moreover', 'filmmaking', 'experience', 'native', 'India', 'U.S.', 'Nair', 'seamless', 'fluency', 'locales', 'movie', 'bit', 'end', 'when', 'ramble', 'feel', 'pat', 'story', 'old', 'world', 'gravitas', 'just', 'time', 'Beforehand', 'was', 'convinced', 'Kal', 'Penn', 'would', 'be', 'spoiler', 'film', 'sharp', 'dedicated', 'performance', 'Gogol', 'Poised', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'actor', 'even', 'White', 'Castle', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'movies', 'bit', 'exaggerated', 'only', 'early', 'teenage', 'scenes', 'recall', 'other', 'movies.However', 'superb', 'work', 'Irfan', 'Khan', 'Tabu', 'parents', 'make', 'film', 'soar', 'bring', 'level', 'assurance', 'compassion', 'ground', 'film', 'completely', 'especially', 'Tabu', 'who', 'seemingly', 'modest', 'character', 'arc', 'Ashima', 'really', 'striking', 'Playing', 'yet', 'variation', 'spoiled', 'American', 'girl', 'Jacinda', 'Barrett', 'again', 'how', 'fearless', 'actress', 'can', 'be', 'exposing', 'vanity', 'ignorance', 'Maxine', 'Gogol', 'first', 'serious', 'girlfriend', 'Moushumi', 'Bengali', 'girl', 'who', 'family', 'seal', 'approval', 'Zuleikha', 'Robinson', 'ripe', 'presence', 'match', 'character', 'aspiring', 'worldliness', 'Cinematographer', 'Frederick', 'Elmes', 'production', 'designer', 'Stephanie', 'Carroll', 'provide', 'masterful', 'work', 'capturing', 'diverse', 'flavors', 'different', 'locales', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'struggled', 'forge', 'own', 'identity', 'only', 'find', 'need', 'embrace', 'past', 'especially', 'who', 'have', 'parents', 'who', 'displayed', 'courage', 'move', 'native', 'lands']",The Namesake

I love character-driven dramas, and this one is quite a mixture of heart felt emotion.  It's true to Nair's style and Indian heritage in that movies can depict complex emotion without becoming too syrupy.  Kal Penn is a winner in this one, and I'd love to see him in more dramas.  Up til now we've seen him in nothing but bombastic comedies save for Superman Returns in which he had no speaking part, but it always does an actor good when he exhibits versatility.  In one scene, he discovers a secret about his wife and for a split second, there's a forceful bit of rage which makes you go ""Wow!  Didn't know he had it in him.""  You want to see more of that.  I don't think it's a long shot to say that Kal Penn has Oscar potential because there obviously is more hidden talent within him than meets the eye.  Like Jamie Foxx, Penn is anchored in comedy, easily pulled off by his very funny persona; however, I think his strongest suit is drama, and we need to see more of it.

645687,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00005JP60,Grady Harp,"[3, 7]","Jhumpa Lahiri's very popular novel THE NAMESAKE has been successfully adapted for the screen by Sooni Taraporevala and the gifted director Mira Nair has gathered a fine cast to capture the spirit of the original story of family commitment despite cultural changes and challenges.  Some of the novel's impact is lost on the big screen, but the tender message remains at the end.In India a gifted young singer Ashima (Tabu) follows her family's rules of matchmaking and marries the quiet Ashoke (Irfan Khan), and soon after the wedding festivities are over the couple depart to New York for Ashoke's career.  The cultural and climate changes are a shock to both, but their marriage soon produces a boy child who, instead of being named traditionally by the grandmother in India, has to have a name assigned in the New York hospital in order to be released with a birth certificate.  Out of desperation, Ashoke decides to temporarily name him Gogol (Ashoke's favorite author)-played as a child by Sohan Chatterjee - , and the family of three soon becomes a family of four with the arrival of their daughter Sonia (Sahira Nair). While the parents maintain the customs of their Bengali heritage, the two children struggle with adapting to their preferred life in America and the conflict between parent and child is magnified by the cultural disparities.  As young Gogol grows toward manhood (now Kal Penn) he favors Western ways and becomes involved with a non-Indian girl Maxine (Jacinda Barrett) and her family.  Gogol tires of the critical comments about his name and decides to change his name to the more traditional Nick- further evidence of his separation from his background.  But family tragedies occur and Gogol finds himself drawn to his mother and to his roots.  When Gogol's father dies, the significance of his family grows even stronger and being unable to identify with Maxine and her family, he instead agrees to 'date' a Bengali girl from his past - Moushumi (Zuleikha Robinson) has blossomed from the frumpy bookworm into a beautiful and experienced woman.  They marry, keeping to Indian traditions, but the marriage is rocky and in the end Gogol discovers that his true happiness is in the rich family history and beauty of his native India.There are moments of rare beauty, both cinematically (camera work is by Frederick Elmes) and emotionally (musical score is a lovely creation by Nitin Sawhney), and while the film is somewhat brittle at times due to the occasional bilingual nature of the script, the main characters are portrayed by such strong actors that the little flaws become unimportant.  It is well to have so many films that deal with the immigrant experience at this particular juncture in our history, and when that theme is enhanced by the beauty of authors such as Lahiri, the messages become even more poignant.

645688,A3URTG22M2SYYZ,B00005JP60,H. Qureshi,"[1, 1]","The Namesake is a vivid interpretation of a novel by Jhumpa Lahiri. It is a wonderful story which embodies love, betrayal, values, and much more. Having read the book, and watched the movie, I have fallen in love.Gogol Ganguli has a funny name, a name that holds dear to his father, and a name of consequence that he does not understand. He belongs to a Hindu family living America, a family whose morals and values are still tied to India. From a young age Gogol was forced to maintain a balance between his American influences and Indian values. As he grew older, he became more distant from his Indian family, and closer to his girlfriend Max's family. His rejection of his heritage furthered when he chose to change his name from Gogol to Nikhil. However, all was going to change. Gogol's father, Ashoke, died of a sudden heart attack, leaving Gogol to realize that he needs to become closer to his family, and in order to do that, he needs to be closer to his culture. Before Ashoke's death, he told Gogol why he named him Gogol, because of life threatening accident he had, in his early years, while he was reading a book by Nikolai Gogol. Gogol understood, and was touched. Ashima, Ashoke's wife was faced with a life of singularity after his death, a life where she had to get a job, drive, and live alone, like any other single American. During this time, Gogol is swept away by Moushumi Mazoomdar, a Bengali girl who he knew from a very young age. He soon arranges to marry her. Their marriage is faced with the challenges of Moushumi's desire to study further, and her love affair with a French man. Gogol, heartbroken, grows further when he visits his mother's going away party to India. He stumbles upon a book, ""The Overcoat"" by Nikolai Gogol; a gift his father had given him, a gift he never opened, or cared about when he was alive.

645692,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B00005JP60,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[2, 3]","If ""The Namesake"" had just been your usual coming-of-age story, it would be easily forgotten. But director Mira Nair (""Monsoon Wedding,"" ""Vanity Fair"") has gone beyond the usual confines of such a story to present a portrait of three people, a husband and wife, and their son, who come to moments when they lose sight of who they are, only to find through difficult times that sense of identity again. The story begins in 1971 Kolkata, a time when foreign products dazzled us and visits by expatriate relatives were pretty much the event of the year. A young Bengali settled in the US, Ashoke Ganguli (Irrfan) marries a local girl Ashima (Tabu) and they migrate to the US. Some years down the line, Ashima gives birth to a son (Kal Penn). The basic premise of the film is this: How will this child survive in American society with a name as odd sounding and tongue twisting as Gogol Ganguli? Nikolai Gogol is Ashoke's favorite author. A brilliant and eccentric man, who penned literary masterpieces like The Overcoat, he eventually starved to death.His modern-day namesake Gogol Ganguli experiences all the usual clich&eacute;s associated with people with unusual names -- his American classmates poke fun at him during lessons on Russian Literature and women raise a quizzical eyebrow at the part when he reveals his name. He grows up, very annoyed. But also, sadly, with a misconception about the origin of his name. Little does he realize that it has a more profound explanation, than he could ever imagine.Though the premise sounds flimsy, the film breathes life into the book's characters by leaps and bounds, expanding the central idea to encompass a whole lot more. It dissects the complex lot of the American Born Confused Desi and more importantly, their attitude towards India. But sans the caricatures and the clich&eacute;s. It traces a troubled son's pilgrimage back to his family and the realizations that don on prodigal children only in the face of immense tragedy. In fact, the film is a tribute to one's parents, but tackles the subject sans the emotional drama of say, a Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham. The accents, the sets, the costumes and the dialogues boast of an authenticity, which is often missing in Indian films set in a foreign country. And the cinematography boasts a host of frames rich in texture, especially in the scenes set in Kolkata.Irrfan Khan brilliantly, effortlessly steps into the shoes (which read 'Made In USA') of the very Bengali, practical, cool-headed Ashoke, accent and all (though it slips in one or two places). The chemistry between Khan and Tabu is intense! Kal Penn has a meaty role and finally, an opportunity to act. And he does a smooth job of it. The rest of the cast measure up perfectly, like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Though the film begins on a somber pace (and slips back off and forth), it gains momentum post Gogol's birth. Nair makes the search for one's identity both enlightening and entertaining- a journey, both internal and external, you won't regret taking.",4,Mira Nair returns... by bringing art back to cinema,1199664000,"01 7, 2008",2008,3025,"['Namesake', 'had', 'just', 'been', 'usual', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'easily', 'forgotten', 'director', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'Monsoon', 'Wedding', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'gone', 'usual', 'confines', 'such', 'story', 'present', 'portrait', 'three', 'people', 'husband', 'wife', 'son', 'who', 'come', 'moments', 'when', 'lose', 'sight', 'who', 'are', 'only', 'find', 'difficult', 'times', 'sense', 'identity', 'again', 'story', '1971', 'Kolkata', 'time', 'when', 'foreign', 'products', 'dazzled', 'visits', 'expatriate', 'relatives', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'event', 'year', 'young', 'Bengali', 'settled', 'US', 'Ashoke', 'Ganguli', 'Irrfan', 'local', 'girl', 'Ashima', 'Tabu', 'migrate', 'US', 'years', 'down', 'line', 'Ashima', 'birth', 'son', 'Kal', 'Penn', 'basic', 'premise', 'film', 'How', 'will', 'child', 'survive', 'American', 'society', 'name', 'odd', 'sounding', 'tongue', 'twisting', 'Gogol', 'Ganguli', 'Nikolai', 'Gogol', 'Ashoke', 'favorite', 'author', 'brilliant', 'eccentric', 'man', 'who', 'penned', 'literary', 'masterpieces', 'Overcoat', 'eventually', 'starved', 'death.His', 'modern-day', 'namesake', 'Gogol', 'Ganguli', 'usual', 'clich', 'eacute', 'associated', 'people', 'unusual', 'names', 'American', 'classmates', 'poke', 'fun', 'lessons', 'Russian', 'Literature', 'women', 'raise', 'quizzical', 'eyebrow', 'part', 'when', 'name', 'up', 'very', 'annoyed', 'also', 'sadly', 'misconception', 'origin', 'name', 'Little', 'realize', 'more', 'profound', 'explanation', 'could', 'ever', 'imagine.Though', 'premise', 'flimsy', 'film', 'life', 'book', 'characters', 'leaps', 'bounds', 'expanding', 'central', 'idea', 'encompass', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'complex', 'lot', 'American', 'Born', 'Confused', 'Desi', 'more', 'importantly', 'attitude', 'India', 'caricatures', 'clich', 'eacute', 's.', 'troubled', 'son', 'pilgrimage', 'back', 'family', 'realizations', 'don', 'prodigal', 'children', 'only', 'face', 'immense', 'tragedy', 'fact', 'film', 'tribute', 'one', 'parents', 'subject', 'emotional', 'drama', 'say', 'Kabhi', 'Khushi', 'Kabhie', 'Gham', 'accents', 'sets', 'costumes', 'dialogues', 'boast', 'authenticity', 'often', 'missing', 'Indian', 'films', 'set', 'foreign', 'country', 'cinematography', 'host', 'frames', 'rich', 'texture', 'especially', 'scenes', 'set', 'Kolkata.Irrfan', 'Khan', 'brilliantly', 'effortlessly', 'shoes', 'read', ""'Made"", 'USA', 'very', 'Bengali', 'practical', 'cool-headed', 'Ashoke', 'accent', 'one', 'two', 'places', 'chemistry', 'Khan', 'Tabu', 'intense', 'Kal', 'Penn', 'meaty', 'role', 'finally', 'opportunity', 'act', 'smooth', 'job', 'rest', 'cast', 'measure', 'up', 'perfectly', 'pieces', 'jigsaw', 'puzzle', 'film', 'somber', 'pace', 'back', 'forth', 'gains', 'momentum', 'post', 'Gogol', 'birth', 'Nair', 'search', 'one', 'identity', 'enlightening', 'entertaining-', 'journey', 'internal', 'external', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'taking']",The Namesake

645694,A146H6A41B26QT,B00005JP60,"J. Marren ""jtm497""","[3, 6]","Based on the novel by Jhumpa Lahiri, ""The Namesake"" on the surface is a story of  culture clash, but on a deeper level it's just a story about growing up. Gogol Ganguli is an Indian boy who is racing as fast as he can to escape his parents and his Bengali heritage. After getting through his obnoxious teenager stage, he goes to Yale and takes up with an almost impossibly WASP girl and her family. It's only upon his father's death that he realizes how much he loved him, but then he runs in the other direction and marries a Bengali girl who nevertheless shares none of his values.  In the end he's off to ""find himself,"" traveling through India and really seeing it for the first time.Much more interesting here is the story of Gogol's parents, especially his mother, and the story of their arranged marriage. And the tale of Ashok, Gogol's father, and how he came to give Gogol his odd name, is quite moving.Although an interesting film, with beautiful insights into Hindu culture, I had the same problem with the movie as I did with the book--we never fully understand the Gogol character, with his abrupt shifts back and forth.  Lahiri came to our attention with her Pulitzer-prize winning collection of short stories, which were truly wonderful, but I don't think she's mastered the novel form, and the trick of watching a character evolve. By filling in more details of Gogol's childhood, the film struggles to overcome this with only partial success.Nevertheless, this is a beautiful film to watch, especially if you've ever been to India, and the story of immigrants adapting to a new culture is compelling. The film makes us really feel how inhospitable, cold and lonely the ""outer boroughs"" of NYC must have felt to a young girl whose first plane trip took her to the United States. Hot and cold running water and gas 24 hours a day, as her husband proudly explains, hardly began to make up for the life she left behind. But Ashima grows into a lovely and mature woman, who is free at the end to choose her life for the first time.

Some of us are named after our fathers and grandfathers (or mothers and grandmothers) for traditional purposes, others are given names because they were ""trendy names"" at the time and picked out of baby books. Some of us were given names that have a much deeper meaning, and such is true for our main character in the ""Namesake"" Gogol.His parents, both bourn and raised in India make the journey to the U.S for a better life and opportunity not only for themselves, but for the children's future. Their lives and cultures tend to clash with American culture, and their children (although being bourn Indian) are raised within American culture and do not have the same ties to their Indian heritage as their parents do.Gogol, struggles with his name and does not understand the reasons for it, being named after a famous Russian author who was deemed ""crazy"" but a genius at the same time. To distance himself from it, he decides to change his name from his ""pet name"" to Nickoli which was his true name, but never put on the birth certificate. His busy ""American life"" distances himself from his parents, of which they do not understand. How can friends and business be more important than his family?Both brother and sister being steeped in American culture cause both frustration and heartache for their parents. Gogol, who despised his given name, learns later on how he came to get that name given to him by his father. The encounter with a train passenger, a terrible train derailment and life changing experience is how he came to be. Gogol's father dies suddenly and only then does he truly begin to understand and embrace his culture, and to accept his true name given to him.You don't have to be ""Indian"" to connect with the story. Families are ""universal"" and watching this film as it unravels over a 25 year span, the message really hits home of the importance of family and our given name.

645707,A129YBX5BVNW2,B00005JP60,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[68, 69]","This movie deals with Bengali culture in India and families both in their native lands and abroad - and I have to say is one of the most satisfying and beautiful watches I had the pleasure of sitting down to. To an Irishman of 49 and typical multiplex type, I'd admit that most of the cast is unrecognizable to me, but that makes no odds, because all are uniformly superb. And I love the insights the film gives into a culture as fascinating as theirs.It begins in 1977 when a young Bengali man (who has been to study in the USA since 1974) is back in his native Calcutta to meet his new bride - one that is picked out for him whether he likes her or not. He is Ashoke, an engineer with prospects - played subtly and gently by a fantastic Irrfan Khan. Ashoke gets real lucky - his bride is the quietly beautiful Ashima (it means limitless, played by the gorgeous Bollywood star Tabu). Waiting with her parents, Ashoke looks uncomfortable but resigned - its been done this way for centuries. Before Ashima goes into the room to see him for the first time - she tries on his American shoes he's left outside the room - they fit and she likes them - a good sign. Ashima takes them off and meekly enters - ultra respect to her elders. Ashoke is not traditionally handsome, but his big soppy bug-eyes and equally studious glasses tell you that this is a good man - and an intelligent one. They marry in full traditional dress and custom. Ashima waves her family goodbye at the airport and then on to New York.Life in America is foreign to her, but she adapts. Besides, something else is happening that makes it all bearable; Ashima is slowly but surely falling in love with her 'chosen' husband. It's in these scenes that the film shows it true charm - it's so beautifully and realistically handled (many scenes returned to later in flashback to flesh out dialogue that is important and pivitol to the story). Their relationship is an evolving love, away from need and initial awkwardness into a mutual respect for each other. The believability of the two lead actors here is crucial - and you can feel their drawing together - year after year after year.The story continues to both of their kids being born (a boy and a girl), then young, then grown up and full of New Yawk attitude and difficulty with the 'old ways' - even with their names. 1st born - and most rebellious - the boy's name is Gogol (played by Kal Penn), which he hates with a passion until he finds out why his father called him that (a train journey and a passenger who changed his life). Gogol and his sister's dual identities cause them both conflict and even heartache. They endure racism, work, snobbery, meet potential partners, they marry - and on it goes - to sad and joyful surprises as their life journey progresses. It's set across 25 years and there's a lot crammed in. (Gogul's sister Sonia is played by Sahira Nair)The Namesake is as much about Indian culture (then and now) as it is about the power and pull of family - that one thing that unites us all with love and misery in equal measure! I can't recommend this movie enough - in my Top 20 with a bullet. A gentle and beautiful surprise I heartily recommend.P.S.: Like Gustavo Santaolalla's music in ""The Motorcycle Diaries""  and ""Babel"", Nitin Sawhney's music is one of the reasons the movie has such slow and majestic power - an absolutely gorgeous soundtrack - and one I'm going to buy pronto!P.P.S.: The title of this review is from the dedication in the credits by the director Mira Nair.",5,"""For Our Parents - Who Gave Us Everything""",1186963200,"08 13, 2007",2007,3526,"['movie', 'Bengali', 'culture', 'India', 'families', 'native', 'lands', 'abroad', 'have', 'say', 'one', 'most', 'satisfying', 'beautiful', 'watches', 'had', 'pleasure', 'sitting', 'down', 'Irishman', '49', 'typical', 'multiplex', 'type', ""'d"", 'admit', 'most', 'cast', 'unrecognizable', 'odds', 'are', 'uniformly', 'superb', 'love', 'insights', 'film', 'culture', 'as', 'fascinating', 'theirs.It', '1977', 'when', 'young', 'Bengali', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'study', 'USA', '1974', 'back', 'native', 'Calcutta', 'meet', 'new', 'bride', 'one', 'picked', 'out', 'not', 'Ashoke', 'engineer', 'prospects', 'played', 'subtly', 'gently', 'fantastic', 'Irrfan', 'Khan', 'Ashoke', 'real', 'lucky', 'bride', 'quietly', 'beautiful', 'Ashima', 'limitless', 'played', 'gorgeous', 'Bollywood', 'star', 'Tabu', 'Waiting', 'parents', 'Ashoke', 'uncomfortable', 'resigned', 'been', 'done', 'way', 'centuries', 'Ashima', 'room', 'see', 'first', 'time', 'American', 'shoes', 'left', 'room', 'fit', 'good', 'sign', 'Ashima', 'off', 'meekly', 'enters', 'ultra', 'respect', 'elders', 'Ashoke', 'not', 'traditionally', 'handsome', 'big', 'soppy', 'bug-eyes', 'equally', 'studious', 'glasses', 'tell', 'good', 'man', 'intelligent', 'one', 'marry', 'full', 'traditional', 'dress', 'custom', 'Ashima', 'family', 'goodbye', 'airport', 'then', 'New', 'York.Life', 'America', 'foreign', 'Besides', 'something', 'else', 'happening', 'bearable', 'Ashima', 'slowly', 'surely', 'falling', 'love', ""'chosen"", 'husband', 'scenes', 'film', 'true', 'charm', 'so', 'beautifully', 'realistically', 'handled', 'many', 'scenes', 'returned', 'later', 'flashback', 'flesh', 'out', 'dialogue', 'important', 'pivitol', 'story', 'relationship', 'evolving', 'love', 'away', 'need', 'initial', 'awkwardness', 'mutual', 'respect', 'other', 'believability', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'here', 'crucial', 'can', 'feel', 'drawing', 'together', 'year', 'year', 'year.The', 'story', 'kids', 'being', 'born', 'boy', 'girl', 'then', 'young', 'then', 'grown', 'up', 'full', 'New', 'Yawk', 'attitude', 'difficulty', ""'old"", 'ways', 'even', 'names', '1st', 'born', 'most', 'rebellious', 'boy', 'name', 'Gogol', 'played', 'Kal', 'Penn', 'passion', 'out', 'why', 'father', 'called', 'train', 'journey', 'passenger', 'who', 'changed', 'life', 'Gogol', 'sister', 'dual', 'identities', 'cause', 'conflict', 'even', 'heartache', 'endure', 'racism', 'work', 'snobbery', 'meet', 'potential', 'partners', 'marry', 'sad', 'joyful', 'surprises', 'life', 'journey', 'set', '25', 'years', 'lot', 'crammed', 'Gogul', 'sister', 'Sonia', 'played', 'Sahira', 'Nair', 'Namesake', 'as', 'much', 'Indian', 'culture', 'then', 'now', 'power', 'pull', 'family', 'one', 'thing', 'love', 'misery', 'equal', 'measure', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'enough', 'Top', '20', 'bullet', 'gentle', 'beautiful', 'surprise', 'heartily', 'recommend.P.S', 'Gustavo', 'Santaolalla', 'music', 'Motorcycle', 'Diaries', 'Babel', 'Nitin', 'Sawhney', 'music', 'one', 'reasons', 'movie', 'such', 'slow', 'majestic', 'power', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'soundtrack', 'one', ""'m"", 'going', 'buy', 'pronto', 'P.P.S', 'title', 'review', 'dedication', 'credits', 'director', 'Mira', 'Nair']",The Namesake

Adjusting to life in a new country is difficult, especially for Ashima, but the Ganguli's children have an easier time blending in with American culture, because it's what they were born into. However, being an American-born child with Bengali parents is a difficulty in itself, and it's something that Ashoke and Ashima's son, Gogol (Kal Penn), has a very hard time dealing with. As Gogol grows into a young man, he distances himself from his family and embraces the American way of life. However, when tragedy strikes, Gogol realizes that his priorities are completely out of whack, and he attempts to make some changes in his life, but not everything goes according to plan.This is a decent adaptation of a stunning book. The cast is fantastic, and I was especially impressed by Khan and Tabu's performances. I think that I expected more out of the film because I am such a huge fan of Lahiri's novel, so it was probably impossible for the film to measure up in my eyes.

645711,AMG2LF8MLUDN1,B00005JP60,M. Fields,"[3, 4]","This is a very touching film about a young woman who meets a young man by the arrangement of the parents.  The story revolves anrond the couple and the life that they make for themselves and their children in America.  Actor, Kal Penn, practically begged Mira Nair (director of Monsoon Wedding and Mississippi Masala) for the role he plays here.  You may know him from Harold and Kumar go to White Castles or other silly comedies.  Penn longed to trade in his goofy, crazy film persona for one more serious and dramatic.  I'm happy to say he did a fine job here and know you can see him on televsion in the new doctor show called House.  His persistance paid off.Penn's charachter is named Gogol, after Russian novelist Nikolai Gogol.  Gogol doesn't like being the novelist's namesake.  The film moves back and forth from Calcutta to New York and contrasts the lives of the characters in much the same way.  A couple from India moves to New York and brings their traditions with them only to be scorned and laughed at by their American born children who are New Yorkers to the core.Kal Penn is correct when he states that this is an American film.  This story could have been told from anyone's perspective.  It could be an African family or an Irish family.  The story is not really driven by nationality.  The kids listen to rock and soul, smoke pot and don't really care about family customs.  At some point later in the film, Gogol learns exactly why his father gave him this name.  I won't spoil it for you here.  Life brings changes and reactions to those changes are very different with each family member.  The Namesake is definately a character driven film. Mira Nair has done a wonderful job directing here.  In it one can sense the pain she felt in losing someone close to her because she uses that pain as a vehicle to drive the film, as it were.  Still, the film is not as heavy handed as it could have been with another director.  There is sadness but there is light heartedness which runs throughout.The cinematography is lovely especially in India.  Shots of the Taj Mahal are beautiful.  The entire cast performs wonderfully.  Kudos to all.  Tabu plays Ashima Ganguli (the mother) with modesty and grace.  Irfan Khan who plays Ashoke Ganguli (the father) uses very subtle facial expressions to convey feelings and thoughts.

645712,AT393OR1JTYNR,B00005JP60,Miami Nights,"[13, 20]","While ""The Namesake"" does deliver a strong message about family and identity, the movie is seemingly less than the sum of its parts, and especially less than its underlying message.While it does have some strong and moving scenes, and scenes that those in similar situations to the characters will know and understand, the movie is often episodic without enough connection made between the scenes. We catch glimpses of their lives, but the filmmaker doesn't quite connect how those scenes affect their lives and understanding as the characters grow older. I'm not asking to be spoonfed the meanings of the scenes (we get enough spoonfeeding of the obvious in  most Hollywood movies), but it often feels we're just jumping from one episode to another with little transition and little reason as to why we saw that moment in their lives. It's like a book of snapshots, one snapshot's done and we quickly move on as if each ""picture"" exists independently of the others.Even the scene of the father telling his son, Gogol, how he got his name isn't as powerful as it could be. Again, I'm not asking for overdone Hollywood histrionics, but more of a feeling than ""OK, the scene ends here, let's move on...""It's still worth watching, but if one purchases it, they'll probably be watching more scenes than others to get the heart in this rather softly directed effort.",2,Message conveyed is stronger than movie itself,1195862400,"11 24, 2007",2007,1361,"['Namesake', 'deliver', 'strong', 'message', 'family', 'identity', 'movie', 'seemingly', 'less', 'sum', 'parts', 'especially', 'less', 'underlying', 'message.While', 'have', 'strong', 'moving', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'similar', 'situations', 'characters', 'will', 'know', 'understand', 'movie', 'often', 'episodic', 'enough', 'connection', 'made', 'scenes', 'catch', 'glimpses', 'lives', 'filmmaker', ""n't"", 'quite', 'connect', 'how', 'scenes', 'affect', 'lives', 'understanding', 'characters', 'grow', 'older', ""'m"", 'not', 'asking', 'be', 'spoonfed', 'meanings', 'scenes', 'get', 'enough', 'spoonfeeding', 'obvious', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'often', ""'re"", 'just', 'jumping', 'one', 'episode', 'little', 'transition', 'little', 'reason', 'why', 'saw', 'moment', 'lives', 'book', 'snapshots', 'one', 'snapshot', 'done', 'quickly', 'move', 'picture', 'independently', 'others.Even', 'scene', 'father', 'telling', 'son', 'Gogol', 'how', 'got', 'name', ""n't"", 'as', 'powerful', 'could', 'be', 'Again', ""'m"", 'not', 'asking', 'overdone', 'Hollywood', 'histrionics', 'more', 'feeling', 'OK', 'scene', 'here', 'let', 'move', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'one', 'purchases', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'watching', 'more', 'scenes', 'others', 'get', 'heart', 'rather', 'softly', 'directed', 'effort']",The Namesake
645713,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00005JP60,mirasreviews,"[2, 3]","""The Namesake"" is the most memorable and enjoyable of all the films about South Asian immigrant families that I've seen. Based on the novel by Jhumpu Lahiri and directed by Mira Nair, it expounds on a familiar theme: Traditional immigrant parents struggling with a new culture and perplexed by their Westernized offspring. This film is always in motion, respectful of the characters' emotions but never stopping to wallow in them. It treats the parents' conventions and perspective as a matter of fact, not as a source of conflict or an issue in need of examination. Along with the striking performances, this approach sets ""The Namesake"" apart from other films with a similar premise.In 1977, Ashoke Ganguli (Irrfan Khan) returns to his family home in Calcutta, India to find a bride to join him in New York, where he is a graduate student. Ashima (Tabu) is the playful, elegant young woman who agrees to marry Ashoke and embark on a new life far away from her country and family. The couple have a son, whom they name Gogol after the Russian writer whose stories played a role in a pivotal event in Ashoke's life. Gogol (Kal Penn) and his sister Sonia (Sahira Nair) grow up both fascinated and annoyed by their Indian heritage, while their parents are bewildered yet tolerant of their self-centered American children. Gogol's priorities and loyalty to family sometimes conflict, like his lifelong love-hate relationship with his name.""The Namesake"" is as much about Ashima's adaptation as about Gogol's dual cultural identities. Bollywood star Tabu is beautiful but not pristinely so. Her face is so interesting that I never stopped wanting to look at her. She is radiant, self-contained, and thoroughly sympathetic. Irrfan Khan is amazing as unassuming, even-tempered Ashoke. My first impression of the cinematography was of ""ordinariness"". In fact, the work is very good and suits ""The Namesake"" perfectly. The view is always interesting. Color and design don't draw attention to themselves but reinforce the characters' authenticity. With first-rate performances and characters that make the audience curious to know them better, ""The Namesake"" may be Mira Nair's best film. In English and Bengali with subtitles.The DVD (20th Century Fox 2007): Bonus features include 3 deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer, 4 featurettes, and an audio commentary. ""The Anatomy of The Namesake: A Class at Columbia University's Graduate Film School"" (32 min) features the director, producer Lydia Dean Pilcher, DP Frederick Elmes, the production designer, editor, and casting director explaining their work and answering students' questions. ""Fox Movie Channel Presents: In Character with Kal Penn"" (4 min) interviews the actor about Gogol. ""Kolkata Love Poem"" (4 min) is a visual tribute to the locations in India, with music. ""Photography as Inspiration"" (8 min) showcases some photos and the scenes that drew on them. The audio commentary by director Mira Nair is constant and detailed. She discusses her inspirations, intentions, and the elements of each scene, and how the film connects the worlds of New York and Calcutta.

There are brilliant acting performances in this film (the ""parent"" Indian actors Tabu and Irfan Khan especially). ""White Castle's"" Kal Penn does a fine job as the young son who at first refuses to understand his immigrant father's ""uncool"" ways then learns to respect and even admire his father's difficult and haunted past (we learn in the film that the father was the only survivor of a catastrophic train crash as a young man).The film follows the lives of the parents as they move to America (with gorgeous, small touches by director Mira Nair that show the challenges of moving to a completely unknown country) and in its second half the film focuses on the son as he grows into maturity and suffers a devastating, unexpected heartbreak that helps (as he puts it) him become truly ""free."" In the mid-section of the film the family visits India for a summer; the children see and appreciate the rich heritage they had ignored to this point in their lives when they visit the Taj Mahal and ingest the astonishing sights and sounds of Kolkata (Calcutta). The film also boasts one of the best soundtracks of the year, which mixes gorgeous Indian tunes and Western music and seamlessly blends the songs with key images from the film.

645718,A3PT0PHUY3RC1F,B00005JP60,P. Kennedy,"[1, 1]","This is a terrific film centered around an immigrant family from India merging into our society.  The plot goes through their trials and tribulations throughout 25 years of their lives.  While eye-opening in certain areas as to how harshly they are treated by others, it's also interesting the cultural differences between how the parents' lives were compared to their two children who were born and raised in New York.  This movie is a must-see for anyone wishing to gain a better appreciation for Indian culture and Hinduism.Basically it starts off with Ashoke returning to India for a wife.  Their parents arrange for them to meet and they marry.  He brings Ashima to live with him in New York.  She is startled with the cultural differences but struggles through.  They go on to have two children and move to the suburbs to raise them.  Ashima's father dies suddenly and the family returns to India for a visit that gives their children exposure to their cultural roots and heritage.  Upon their return, their son Gogol begins to have trouble accepting his name due to all of the peer pressure.  He asks to change his name shortly after graduation to prevent any future issues.  He begins a relationship and loses touch with his own family in the process.  In the meantime, his dad's health begins to fail and while in Cleveland he dies suddenly of a heart attack.  This dramatic event results in Gogol returning to his cultural roots.  Ashima is left feeling lost and devastated without her husband.  Gogol begins to date the daughter of a family friend and they eventually marry.  Soon after, his wife feels too constricted in the marriage and begins an affair.  Gogol finds out through her slip of the tongue.  Sonia, Ashima's daughter, eventually finds her life partner as well.  While at the house for Sonia's announcement, Gogol finds a book his father left for him of his namesake giving him true meaning in life and its journey.  It is at this point he realizes that ""there are no accidents.""  Ashima eventually returns to India to follow her singing for six months a year.Another intriguing aspect of this film is the many references to Indian heritage and Hinduism.  The story opens with the arrangement of marriage between Ashoke and Ashima and then their traditional Indian marriage ceremony which she is shown beautifully decorated.  After the birth of Gogol, they were shocked to learn that he could not leave the hospital until a name had been given for his birth certificate.  In India, the children are not formerly named until later.  The family from India came to visit for the first solid food ceremony, which is another significant Hindu celebration.  Many years later, the assimilation into American culture was noticed with their Christmas decorations.  Once Ashoke passed away, Gogol shaves his head, the family has a small ceremony in their home and then returns to India to leave Ashoke's ashes in the sacred Ganges River.  Gogol's marriage ceremony taken place in New York created another cultural clash since a fire was not allowed in the building.  Each time while in India, there are gods and goddesses publicly displayed.  Additionally, for each of these Hindu ceremonies, they use chanting, music, incense, etc. just as they would in India.",4,Captivating portrayal of Indian culture and Hinduism,1202428800,"02 8, 2008",2008,3276,"['terrific', 'film', 'centered', 'immigrant', 'family', 'India', 'merging', 'society', 'plot', 'trials', 'tribulations', '25', 'years', 'lives', 'eye-opening', 'certain', 'areas', 'how', 'harshly', 'are', 'treated', 'others', 'also', 'interesting', 'cultural', 'differences', 'how', 'parents', 'lives', 'were', 'compared', 'two', 'children', 'who', 'were', 'born', 'raised', 'New', 'York', 'movie', 'must-see', 'anyone', 'wishing', 'gain', 'better', 'appreciation', 'Indian', 'culture', 'Hinduism.Basically', 'Ashoke', 'returning', 'India', 'wife', 'parents', 'arrange', 'meet', 'marry', 'Ashima', 'live', 'New', 'York', 'startled', 'cultural', 'differences', 'through', 'go', 'have', 'two', 'children', 'move', 'suburbs', 'raise', 'Ashima', 'father', 'suddenly', 'family', 'India', 'visit', 'children', 'exposure', 'cultural', 'roots', 'heritage', 'return', 'son', 'Gogol', 'have', 'trouble', 'accepting', 'name', 'due', 'peer', 'pressure', 'change', 'name', 'shortly', 'graduation', 'prevent', 'future', 'issues', 'relationship', 'touch', 'own', 'family', 'process', 'meantime', 'dad', 'health', 'fail', 'Cleveland', 'suddenly', 'heart', 'attack', 'dramatic', 'event', 'results', 'Gogol', 'returning', 'cultural', 'roots', 'Ashima', 'left', 'feeling', 'lost', 'devastated', 'husband', 'Gogol', 'date', 'daughter', 'family', 'friend', 'eventually', 'marry', 'Soon', 'wife', 'feels', 'too', 'constricted', 'marriage', 'affair', 'Gogol', 'out', 'slip', 'tongue', 'Sonia', 'Ashima', 'daughter', 'eventually', 'life', 'partner', 'well', 'house', 'Sonia', 'announcement', 'Gogol', 'book', 'father', 'left', 'namesake', 'giving', 'true', 'meaning', 'life', 'journey', 'point', 'are', 'accidents', 'Ashima', 'eventually', 'India', 'follow', 'singing', 'six', 'months', 'year.Another', 'intriguing', 'aspect', 'film', 'many', 'references', 'Indian', 'heritage', 'Hinduism', 'story', 'arrangement', 'marriage', 'Ashoke', 'Ashima', 'then', 'traditional', 'Indian', 'marriage', 'ceremony', 'shown', 'beautifully', 'decorated', 'birth', 'Gogol', 'were', 'shocked', 'learn', 'could', 'not', 'leave', 'hospital', 'name', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'birth', 'certificate', 'India', 'children', 'are', 'not', 'formerly', 'named', 'later', 'family', 'India', 'came', 'visit', 'first', 'solid', 'food', 'ceremony', 'significant', 'Hindu', 'celebration', 'Many', 'years', 'later', 'assimilation', 'American', 'culture', 'was', 'noticed', 'Christmas', 'decorations', 'Once', 'Ashoke', 'passed', 'away', 'Gogol', 'head', 'family', 'small', 'ceremony', 'home', 'then', 'returns', 'India', 'leave', 'Ashoke', 'ashes', 'sacred', 'Ganges', 'River', 'Gogol', 'marriage', 'ceremony', 'taken', 'place', 'New', 'York', 'created', 'cultural', 'clash', 'fire', 'was', 'not', 'allowed', 'building', 'time', 'India', 'are', 'gods', 'goddesses', 'publicly', 'displayed', 'Additionally', 'Hindu', 'ceremonies', 'use', 'chanting', 'music', 'incense', 'etc', 'just', 'would', 'India']",The Namesake

The parents assimilate into American life, arriving in this country as married grown adults.  They adhere to their Bengali traditions but learn to build new lives, far away from their roots and relatives.  The children, born in this country, regard themselves as ""American"" first, and seek to reconcile their family's upbringing and Bengali traditions with the secular, loose, American lifestyle. These are often in conflict.""The Namesake"" refers to why the father, Ashoke, named his son ""Gogol"", honoring the famed but flawed Russian author.  Ashoke was reading one of Gogol's books while talking to a fellow train passenger outside Calcutta when there was a tragic train wreck. Before dying, the passenger advised Ashoke that life was short and to get out of India and see the world.  This was a life transforming experience, and as one of the few survivors of the wreck, Ashoke took his advice and ended up living and raising a family in America.  The name ""Gogol""  was a problem for the boy, making him the target of ridicule.  The idea of names and identity is a theme throughout the movie.This is an excellent movie that feels Indian but not Bollywood.

Althought I have not read ""Namesake"" , I knew I wanted to see the film.  I imagined from her previous work colorful characters, clothes and surroundings and sure enough, I was not disappointed.  We meet a young man of Indian descent who is named Gogol, after famous Russian writer.  That name seems to be a torment in his life, until one day he decides to change it, americanize it and convert even his Indian name Nikhil to Nick.  Born and raised in the America to his Indian parents, he has difficulty trying to identify with his Indian ancestry.  So, his girlfriend is blond American girl from a higher social status and we see Nick slowly pulling away from his family.  It is only thru his father's death that Nick realizes who he is, what heritage really means to his family and him personally.  Inevitably, that means the end of his life that until that moment he has known.  And then again, it is Nick's marriage to Bengali woman he has known since his childhood that creates new conflicts in his life. Are the pressures of one's heritage such that one has to deny his/her true feelings toward a person of a different heritage?  How much is the modern life on the western hemisphere influenced new generations in the ways they want to live their lives?  I absolutely loved film's tenderness and its slow rhytm.  I felt drawn to the characters and curious about their inner life.  But then the best part of all is the film's ending that simply states ""To our parents who sacrificed everything to give us what we have"".

645726,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JP60,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","Based on the novel by Jhumpa Lahiri , ""The Namesake"" is a moving and thoughtful tale of two generations of Bengalese living in the United States.The movie begins in India in 1977 with the arranged marriage between the sheltered Ashima (Tabu) and a young college professor named Ashoke (Irrfan Khan) who lives and works in New York City.  The film chronicles their early years as a couple, the births of their son and daughter, and the eventual maturing of those children into highly Americanized young adults.  The issue of arranged marriage - or at least the avoidance of a mixed marriage - inevitably comes to the fore as the young man, Gogol (""Harold and Kumar""'s Kal Penn), falls in love with a beautiful blonde artist he brings home to meet his parents.With tenderness and sensitivity, ""The Namesake"" illuminates a dilemma that all immigrants must one day face:  how to assimilate oneself into the adopted culture while, at the same time, remaining faithful to one's roots.  The movie astutely captures the tension that develops between parents and their offspring when first-generation youngsters have no affection for - or even interest in - the Old World customs.But this is more than just your typical multi-cultural generation-gap drama; it is an intensely moving look at personal identity, at marital and filial relationships, and at the deep and abiding bond that is family.  For, in the end, Gogol learns that he must embrace both sides of his heritage if he is to have any hope of discovering the person he truly is.But personal growth is not limited solely to the younger generation, for the adults are forced to accept the fact that traditionalism comes with its own limitations and drawbacks as well.The movie is bolstered by beautiful performances - most notably by Tabu and Khan as the two parents - and by lyrical and sensitive direction by Mira Nair, most renowned in this country for ""Salaam Bombay,"" ""Mississippi Masala,"" and ""Monsoon Wedding.""With little fuss or fanfare, ""The Namesake"" manages to tell an epic story while remaining intimate in scope and specific in detail.  The screenplay by Sooni Taraporevala constantly shifts its point-of-view, so that different characters become the ""protagonist"" at various points in the story.  The result is a richly observed and fully rounded perspective on the events that unfold.""The Namesake"" is a beautiful and heartfelt work overflowing with wisdom and universal appeal.",4,moving look at the immigrant experience,1248739200,"07 28, 2009",2009,2443,"['Based', 'novel', 'Jhumpa', 'Lahiri', 'Namesake', 'moving', 'thoughtful', 'tale', 'two', 'generations', 'Bengalese', 'living', 'United', 'States.The', 'movie', 'India', '1977', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'sheltered', 'Ashima', 'Tabu', 'young', 'college', 'professor', 'named', 'Ashoke', 'Irrfan', 'Khan', 'who', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'film', 'early', 'years', 'couple', 'births', 'son', 'daughter', 'eventual', 'maturing', 'children', 'highly', 'Americanized', 'young', 'adults', 'issue', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'least', 'avoidance', 'mixed', 'marriage', 'inevitably', 'fore', 'young', 'man', 'Gogol', 'Harold', 'Kumar', 'Kal', 'Penn', 'love', 'beautiful', 'blonde', 'artist', 'home', 'meet', 'parents.With', 'tenderness', 'sensitivity', 'Namesake', 'dilemma', 'immigrants', 'must', 'one', 'day', 'face', 'how', 'assimilate', 'adopted', 'culture', 'same', 'time', 'remaining', 'faithful', 'one', 'roots', 'movie', 'astutely', 'tension', 'parents', 'offspring', 'when', 'first-generation', 'youngsters', 'have', 'affection', 'even', 'interest', 'Old', 'World', 'customs.But', 'more', 'just', 'typical', 'multi-cultural', 'generation-gap', 'drama', 'intensely', 'moving', 'look', 'personal', 'identity', 'marital', 'filial', 'relationships', 'deep', 'abiding', 'bond', 'family', 'end', 'Gogol', 'must', 'embrace', 'sides', 'heritage', 'have', 'hope', 'discovering', 'person', 'truly', 'is.But', 'personal', 'growth', 'not', 'limited', 'solely', 'younger', 'generation', 'adults', 'are', 'forced', 'accept', 'fact', 'traditionalism', 'own', 'limitations', 'drawbacks', 'well.The', 'movie', 'bolstered', 'beautiful', 'performances', 'most', 'notably', 'Tabu', 'Khan', 'two', 'parents', 'lyrical', 'sensitive', 'direction', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'most', 'renowned', 'country', 'Salaam', 'Bombay', 'Mississippi', 'Masala', 'Monsoon', 'Wedding', 'little', 'fuss', 'fanfare', 'Namesake', 'tell', 'epic', 'story', 'remaining', 'intimate', 'scope', 'specific', 'detail', 'screenplay', 'Sooni', 'Taraporevala', 'constantly', 'point-of-view', 'different', 'characters', 'become', 'protagonist', 'various', 'points', 'story', 'result', 'richly', 'observed', 'fully', 'rounded', 'perspective', 'events', 'unfold', 'Namesake', 'beautiful', 'heartfelt', 'work', 'overflowing', 'wisdom', 'universal', 'appeal']",The Namesake

The parents move to the country, try to get acclimated, have children and then try to instill traditional values in them as they grow up and deal with their own difficulties. ""The Namesake"" is a very good film, but it lacks just a little something to make it a great film.Ashoke (Irfan Khan, star of many Bollywood films) meets Ashima (Tabu) in India. Their parents are very keen on their marriage and both consent to become man and wife; Ashoke is clearly taken by Ashima's beauty and Ashima seems to be intrigued with the idea of living in America. Upon their arrival in New York, Ashoke immediately returns to work, leaving his new wife to acclimate to the new, cold weather surroundings alone. Soon, they have a child, Gogol, named after Ashoke's favorite author, Nikolai Gogol. Then, they have a daughter, Sonia. As the children grow, they become more and more entrenched in the American way of life, eschewing many of the parent's traditional beliefs. After graduating from college, Gogol (Kal Penn, ""Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle"", TV's ""24"") announces he wants to change his name, he can't see Gogol Ganguli on a resume getting him a good job. This causes a rift between father and son, causing discord in their relationship.Directed by Mira Nair, ""The Namesake"" is a beautiful looking, thoughtful film. If Nair is able to accomplish anything, it is to make her films thoughtful examinations of the challenges her characters face in a new environment, or as they strain against old-fashioned ideas and morals. Her films have concentrated primarily on the experience of Indians, both in India and America, throwing her min characters into a new situation, as they face many challenges. In ""The Namesake"", the story centers on the Ganguli family and it is much different than I originally anticipated.Watching the trailers, you might get the impression the film is primarily about the struggles of Gogol (Penn), as he deals with life as an Indian in the United States. Actually, his story is just a part of the overall film. The film begins in the 70s, as Ashoke travels on a train, reading a collection of works by Nikolai Gogol. Later, he meets Ashima, they marry, move to America, get to know one another, have children, and much more. The film presents a lot of detail about the lives of this family.In less capable hands, the film would completely succumb to its `melodramatic' structure, but Nair manages to keep these tendencies at bay, for most of the film. The director makes the characters very real, showing them in very natural situations. This is the history of this family, not merely a slice of life. Because of that, we watch various, representative episodes through the years, in an attempt to get a full picture of the Ganguli family.Irfan Khan has made about forty films, according to IMDB, and this is the first time I have ever seen him on screen. The majority of his work has been in Bollywood, but with this film, he appears to be branching out and has just completed a role in the Anjelina Jolie film about journalist Daniel Pearl and his wife. Khan is really good as Ashoke. He makes the character seem real by imbuing him with feelings and attitudes that seem real. He almost doesn't appear to be acting; he appears to be pulling thoughts and ideas from his real life to make this character seem more realistic. When he is happy, he smiles slightly, when he is upset, his eyes narrow and he stares at the person he is talking to. He isn't effusive, but realizes he has to protect his family and try to live with their mistakes, even if he disagrees.Tabu is also very good as Ashima, the Ganguli family matriarch. As soon as she arrives in America, she tries to acclimate, on her own, but finds it too much. When Ashoke realizes this, he becomes much more compassionate, maybe even falls in love with her a little more. As she grows older, and her children grow older, she becomes more of a patriarch, more of a guiding force in her children's lives.Kal Penn is probably the most recognizable face in the cast. He is good, but he is not a great actor. Penn is capable of delivering the emotions necessary to portray Gogol, the young man torn between tradition and his desire to be a modern American, but he only delivers the one emotion, or thought, never making his character seem real. When Gogol is supposed to be sad, Penn frowns. When he is happy, Penn smiles. There is never anything underneath the surface, never a layer of conflict or a layer of any other emotion than the one he is supposed to portray at that given moment. This makes his performance serviceable, but not much else.Initially, I thought the film would be primarily about Gogol, which would mean a lot of screen time for Penn. I was surprised to find the film is more of a family portrait, charting the course of this family's journey to America and how they deal with all of their problems. This helps the film because it takes the focus off of Penn and let's the other actors, the better actors, contribute to the success of the film. The other actors are better.Jacinda Barrett (""Poseidon"", ""School for Scoundrels"") appears as Gogol's American girlfriend. And she is also serviceable. It is easy to see why he would be attracted to her, physically, but she is also a little boring. She is always smiling, a little giggly, which fits her character well. But we never really learn anything about her. At one point, Gogol asks her about her dreams and ambitions. Her replay is ""I don't want to think about it now"".Nair has a real knack for pulling away the layers, allowing her characters to show their feelings in a natural way. Ashoke is a complicated character, and we see that in just about every scene, every conversation, every action. Nair allows the character to retain their Indian roots and heritage, yet deal with life in America. Throughout the film, the family has traditional celebrations, interacts with the Indian community and through these moments, we get a glimpse of this culture. I am not an expert, but because these moments are so thoughtful, and interesting, I have no doubt they are also realistic as well.""The Namesake"" is a well-made and thoughtful film, but because of the very reasons it is well made, it is less than great. Because the film covers so much territory, it seems slightly melodramatic, cutting through the film's power like a knife to butter. The scenes are well done and get the message across, but they give the film an episodic structure. There is an overall theme to the film, Gogol accepting his heritage and identity, and there is another layer below that, which I won't reveal, but because the scenes are episodic, they don't allow the story to generate any heat or power, to make it resonate with the viewer. The final moments will move you, I just wish there were more moments like this throughout the film.As you watch, you will become engrossed in the lives of these characters, then the story shifts, and you have to become familiar with them again, at this new point in their lives. This isn't bad, but these scenes don't always grab us, and demand our attention. After a while, they become a little routine and our attention shifts.""The Namesake"" is a well-made film, worth your attention, but it is not an incredible film, or a memorable film. You will likely only remember it when you hear about Mira Nair's next film.",4,"3 1/2 - ""The Namesake"" is good, but too reserved",1174780800,"03 25, 2007",2007,7610,"['Namesake', 'directed', 'Mira',

She likes him and they marry. She accompanies her husband back to America, where houses stand far apart and are covered by the grey snow of cities.They have a first child whom they name Gogol after the Russian writer the husband so admires. The parents make American friends and are on good terms with most everyone. They are not, and can never be, quite at home in this alien land but they find contentment and happiness. They buy a home and invite their Indian friends to a traditional ceremony blessing their house.The boy grows up in the United States and rebels against his Indian heritage. His parents accept this as a result of their own choice to live abroad. A trip back to India brings the relief of a homecoming, but the family must return to their new chosen homeland.As a story, the Namesake hardly breaks new ground.
