680724,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B00005RYLP,Anyechka,"[0, 1]","The title of this DVD is rather misleading; I understand why some people feel disgruntled because it didn't have any shorts on it but instead had a bunch of rarities and documentaries.  With a title like 'All-Time Favorites,' one would logically expect something better-known and more beloved than things that only a completist, not a casual fan, would be really interested in seeing.  The four programs included are:Highlights of a 1998 fan convention.  We get to see members of all six Stooges' families gathered here, as well as fans of all ages, doing things like competing in a trivia contest, throwing pies, visiting their final resting places, sharing stories and memories, and checking out memorabilia.  It's not a very long film, but it is interesting and worth watching if you're more than just a casual fan.The long-unseen and unaired pilot for a proposed 1949 tv series entitled 'Jerks of All Trades,' also starring Emil Sitka, Symona Boniface, and Joseph Kearns (the original Mr. Wilson on 'Dennis the Menace').  This is a pretty funny piece of film, though it does feel a little off due to the lack of sound effects and the laughter of the studio audience.  It just kind of has a different flow, being filmed before a live audience instead of being shown in theatres after being edited to perfection.  Unfortunately, the bigwigs at Columbia threw their weight around and threatened a lawsuit and the termination of their contract if they appeared in a tv series, feeling it would not only violate some stupid clause in their contract but also create competition for their series of shorts.  Perhaps if this had been allowed to air, their popularity would have reached its peak ten years before it went on to do, introducing them to television even earlier, perhaps even opening the door for them to have starred in features while they were still in their peak years.  Typically, since the film was shelved for decades, the A/V quality is pretty bad.'Family Album,' a short documentary featuring rare photos and home movies of the boys, together with a chronological narration starting with the immigration of Solomon and Jennie Horwitz to America and ending in the present day.  However, I do wish it had been a bit longer, and it was unfortunate how at least two bits of misinformation were included.  Once again we're given the erroneous story about Shemp leaving the group in 1932 to play Knobby Walsh in the Joe Palooka series, when in actual fact he starred in that series in 1936, and we're laughably told that Joe DeRita had always held the Stooges' comedy in high respect and admiration, even before he joined the group.  In other sources he's quoted as saying he never found them funny, thought working with them was beneath him, and felt that, as a top banana in burlesque, all of the stuff he did with them was mere slumming.  We're also told that Joe Besser had it in his contract that he couldn't get hit, which is nothing more than an urban legend.  True, he didn't like to get hit (partly because that kind of thing just wasn't funny or believable with his screen persona), and he didn't take a huge amount of physical punishment in the 16 Stooge shorts he was in, but he did get hit and take physical abuse more than just a few isolated times.'Kook's Tour,' an hour-long travelogue/home movie of sorts from 1970.  It's not really intended as a comedy, so one shouldn't expect any classic zaniness.  It has a few moments, but overall it's pretty dull, and it is pretty sad to watch, knowing that Larry had a stroke during the last days of filming.  However, as dull and unfunny as this film is (even considering it's not really supposed to be a comedy), I just can't give this one a one-star rating, since it just shows how devoted at least Moe and Larry were to continuing the act even as senior citizens, trying for one last hurrah, giving it their all even though they were long past their creative peak and no longer had the same energy they did in the Thirties, Forties, or even early Fifties.  It's worth seeing once, if only for its historical significance.As interesting as these rarities are, however, they are somewhat marred by a bit of shameless self-promotion by Comedy III (a group run by Joe DeRita's stepsons, who own the legal rights to their images, the distribution of most of their films, their names, and that has even trademarked the word ""knucklehead"").  At the end of most of these programs, there are a bunch of credits hawking their website, phone numbers, and addresses (just in case we wanted, for example, one of those ""Golf with your friends"" pictures from 'Three Little Beers' that is *everywhere*), like making what should have been a loving tribute to these great comedians into a commercial for Comedy III.  I just found that REALLY tacky.  It was also annoying how the only clips of their Columbia shorts which were shown during the fan convention and the 'Family Album' were from the 4 public domain shorts (and in shabby condition at that).  Since this DVD was put together by C3 (a fact impossible to miss by all of the self-promotion during the credits), the group that owns the rights to the other 186 shorts, why in the world did they only use those 4 shorts that everyone has seen over and over again?  It got really boring and annoying seeing clips of these same 4 shorts over and over again!This certainly isn't a DVD that a new or casual fan is going to want to pick up, and while it's also not something most serious fans are going to want to watch over and over again, it does have some worthwhile rarities for a pretty nice price.  If you can get past the shameless self-promotion during the credits, this is a pretty good disc for the completist to add to one's collection.",4,Interesting rarities,1157846400,"09 10,

680727,A3JTAUXHZQN092,B00005RYLP,"Dean Wisland ""Titanic buff""","[0, 0]","This DVD contains four programs. The first is a short documentary about the history of the three stooges. Stooge fans will know most of this history, but the home movies of Moe and Shemp with their familes, as well as footage of Curly on his wedding day make it worthwile. The second is highlights of a Stooge convention. I didnt find it all that interesting, though it was fun to see family members of the boys, like Larry and Shemp's grandchildern and Moe and Curlys daughters.The third program is Jerks of All Trades. Made before a live audience in 1949, it was a pilot for a proposed TV series. It had the boys as interior decarators who brutalize a potential customer, played by Emil Sitka. Somyona Bonniface then calls the boys to come decorate a room in her house, unaware they just brutalized her husband. Of course, the boys make a complete mess of everything. The show never aired, because of a clause in their Columbia contract, forbidding them from doing a series on TV that would compete with their two reel comedies. This was done on Kiniscope, thus picture and sound are not too good. But it is watchable, and interesting to see what a Stooges TV show would have been like.The final program, Kook's Tour, was made in 1969 and was intended to be a pilot for a weekly series showing the retired Stooges traveling around the world. Shot in color, it was filmed in Idaho and Yellowstone National Park. The boys go camping and fishing, and Larry can't catch one fish. Moe says, If you don't catch one you don't eat one. Poor Larry ends up eating corn flakes. Unfourtantely, Larry suffered a serious stroke before filming was completed, and had to retire from the Stooges. Director Normam Maurer extended the show to one hour in hopes of selling it as a TV special, but it never aired. It was sold as a Super 8 film in the late 1970's. It was finally released on VHS, and now DVD. Not a good film, but the Stooges deserve a nice round of applause for at least trying to do something different at such a late time in their careers.
