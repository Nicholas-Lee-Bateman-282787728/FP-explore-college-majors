1614613,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B00AO7HQ9M,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","We've seen this before. A seemingly stable household becomes disrupted when a black sheep relative or friend makes an unscheduled appearance. This might not be the best of the lot buts it's watchable and entertaining.Here's the scoop. William (Luke Wilson) is in the high-level real estate game. His wife Katherine (Anna Paquin) does the society thing in and around town while distancing herself from her two young children, both who have issues. William's black-sheep brother Scott (Ryan Phillippe) rides up on a horse with a boatload of booze and pills and turns everything topsy turvy. But, in his own way he reveals to them they may have a good lifestyle but they're far from having good lives.I can't say there are a lot of surprises here. You see the set-up early on and you're pretty well assured where things are headed. A few things do happen that are unexpected but nothing that alters the destination. What is going on here is the acting. Luke Wilson has a natural presence in front of the camera and he's decent here as is Anna Paquin. The big surprise for me was Ryan Phillippe. I'm not a big fan of his which almost caused me to pass this one by, but, for my dollar, he was what was happening here. The way he stands, walks, his voice and his southern accent all add up to a really good character. This is shot well with some nice scenes showing the Northern Louisiana bayou area. It has decent production values for an indy film and it sports a nice musical score.This isn't quite worth the 4 stars I gave it, mostly due to its derivative nature.

It's a drama through and through -- an in-depth character study of a woman (Anna Paquin) whose life is pretty much turned upside-down as her brother-in-law (Luke Wilson) (and former lover) waltzes back into her life when her husband is out of town. In any other movie, that premise would be a recipe for Paquin's character to leave her lifeless marriage for Wilson -- but the writers thankfully strayed away from that scenario, one that would have emotionally scarred Paquin's two young children beyond repair. It's implied (via a dead mother's journal) that Wilson is the father of Paquin's oldest child, but thankfully the movie spends no time on it -- it comes up in one sentence and that's it.""Straight A's"" is sentimental, but the writers resisted the temptation to make it overly so.

While she seems the raison d'etre of the film, the love, first and true, of two brothers, the fly in the ointment lost soul of a brother played by Ryan Phillippe adding tension to the mild estrangement of the husband and wife, no character portrays a complete personality.  Instead, predictable stereotypes seem to direct the plot.  Anna's portrayal is brittle and bristling as though she is playing AT a person instead of IN the character.  This greatly detracts from the entire film.The bright lights are the children, mysterious and surprising, accepting of the unconventional which their parents stridently reject.
