Everyone is in top-notch form (Voight, Dunaway) and Ricky Shroder delivers a break-through job that should have been nominated for an Oscar. Here is a bit of trivia: Apparently Shroder was having a difficult time being able to cry on camera. La Dunaway, always being the true professional that she is, asked the director to give her a few moments alone with the boy. In order to help Ricky prep for his emotional finale to seeing his Champ pass away, Faye grabbed hold of Shroder's baby testicles with her thumb and forefinger and pinched as hard as she could. Just as soon as Ricky yelped out in terrible pain and the tears began to run like a sink faucet, Dunaway whispers in his ear ""do the scene"" and the director yells ""Roll!""

276683,A1KL0B5UFWI2SI,6301966023,BullDog,"[2, 2]","As good as Jon Voight and Faye Dunaway are in this, I deeply believe Ricky Schroder's performance holds the entire film together. Looking at this little boy, you can't help but fall in love with him; smile when he smiles, cry when he cries and so on. Ricky cries, not only tears of grief but of disappointment (the scene where his horse gets injured in the race), fear (the scene where the Champ is arrested for assault), persuasion (the jail scene where his father tells him to live with Annie), confusion, denial (the state room scene with Faye Dunaway) but above all else, love (the scene where he and his father reunite in the stands). The love T.J. has for his father is so moving and so deep it goes to show you it's just as natural, just as important and just as valuable for there to be affection between fathers and sons; not just fathers and daughters. I also love the part where Billy's in the gym training for the fight and there's his beautiful little boy at the ropes watching him closely. Through his big blue eyes you can see the champ's inspiration: his son's love for him. (The music certainly adds to it.) Furthermore, the character of T.J. I believe is a role model for kids who have difficulty showing their feelings. As you can see, T.J. never hides what he feels, never holds back what he's thinking, never lets any person's ignorance pull him down. (The scene with Joan Blondell before the race.) He's not judgmental, selfish or naive. He's one of those people who behaves as nobody but himself and loves people unconditionally. Like Judy Garland in THE WIZARD OF OZ, Macaulay Culkin in HOME ALONE, Brad Renfro in THE CLIENT, Henry Thomas in E.T., and Peter Billingsley in A CHRISTMAS STORY, Ricky Schroder holds his own. His winning of a Golden Globe Award is testiment to that fact. If you not only enjoy a good cry but believe in bonding between fathers and sons, check this film out. THE CHAMP will certainly tear your heart out, but in a positive way. And maybe, for those who don't have kids yet, it'll inspire you to want a son like T.J.",5,Ricky Rules The Show!,1364601600,"03 30, 2013",2013,2068,"['As', 'good', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'are', 'deeply', 'believe', 'Ricky', 'Schroder', 'performance', 'entire', 'film', 'together', 'Looking', 'little', 'boy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'fall', 'love', 'smile', 'when', 'cry', 'when', 'so', 'Ricky', 'cries', 'not', 'only', 'tears', 'grief', 'disappointment', 'scene', 'where', 'horse', 'injured', 'race', 'fear', 'scene', 'where', 'Champ', 'arrested', 'assault', 'persuasion', 'jail', 'scene', 'where', 'father', 'live', 'Annie', 'confusion', 'denial', 'state', 'room', 'scene', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'else', 'love', 'scene', 'where', 'father', 'reunite', 'stands', 'love', 'T.J.', 'father', 'so', 'moving', 'so', 'deep', 'show', 'just', 'natural', 'just', 'important', 'just', 'valuable', 'be', 'affection', 'fathers', 'sons', 'not', 'just', 'fathers', 'daughters', 'also', 'love', 'part', 'where', 'Billy', 'gym', 'training', 'fight', 'beautiful', 'little', 'boy', 'ropes', 'watching', 'closely', 'big', 'blue', 'eyes', 'can', 'see', 'champ', 'inspiration', 'son', 'love', 'music', 'certainly', 'Furthermore', 'character', 'T.J', 'believe', 'role', 'model', 'kids', 'who', 'have', 'difficulty', 'showing', 'feelings', 'can', 'see', 'T.J.', 'never', 'what', 'never', 'back', 'what', 'thinking', 'never', 'person', 'ignorance', 'pull', 'down', 'scene', 'Joan', 'Blondell', 'race', 'not', 'judgmental', 'selfish', 'naive', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'nobody', 'people', 'unconditionally', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'THE', 'WIZARD', 'OF', 'OZ', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'HOME', 'ALONE', 'Brad', 'Renfro', 'THE', 'CLIENT', 'Henry', 'Thomas', 'E.T.', 'Peter', 'Billingsley', 'A', 'CHRISTMAS', 'STORY', 'Ricky', 'Schroder', 'own', 'winning', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Award', 'testiment', 'fact', 'not', 'only', 'enjoy', 'good', 'cry', 'believe', 'bonding', 'fathers', 'sons', 'check', 'film', 'out', 'CHAMP', 'will', 'certainly', 'tear', 'heart', 'positive', 'way', 'maybe', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'kids', 'yet', ""'ll"", 'inspire', 'want', 'son', 'T.J']",N/A

276685,AYHDKBFFAFEJU,6301966023,C. Martin,"[2, 2]","Found this movie at a local library. I've watched it with and without commentary from Schroder and Voigt. There were a couple things that stood out as ""unfinished""...for starters, the package TJ gave to ""The Champ"" at the beginning of the movie, could've been brought back into the flick at the end...but it wasn't. And what happened with the $2K that The Champ asked Annie for in order to save the horse? Where did it go?Other than those two things, the movie was fairly good for a movie from the late '70s.TJ (Rick Schroder):This was apparently Schroders first movie, and he provided a wonderful performance. There were a couple reviewers who said his character portrayed a child more sophisticated than a normal 8 year old. TJ (his character) HAD to be more mature than a normal 8 year old, he was the only child of a single father who struggled with gambling and alcohol. TJ had to take on more maturity to make up for what The Champ lacked. There are many children in similar situations who also exude more maturity than their peers.Annie (Faye Dunaway):The confrontation between The Champ and Annie in the barn after She's a Lady injured herself, was sub-par and confusing. Part of the time Annie is laughing, and it seems that the director didn't catch that or something....because the interaction between the two characters was physically confrontational (with the Champ man-handling her) it seemed sickly un-natural for her character to go from laughing to crying and screaming at him in a split second with no additional action from him between the two vastly different responses.Finally, The Champ (Jon Voigt):I confess, I had not seen any of Jon's early work. This movie is the earliest work of his that I've seen. I almost didn't recognize him. I was impressed by the depth he was able to give to his character when, at the end, Annie had come to him in the barn and The Champ became really vulnerable in asking her to ""come back, we'll give you a second chance"". And at her refusal, immediately the bravado returned.I was impressed by the interaction between Schroder and Voigt throughout the movie, and it was compounded when listening to the two of them on the commentary throughout the movie. However, I was not impressed by Dunaway's performance as much. She seemed more ""mentally off"" than the Champ was.It is definitely a different style movie than those coming out today. For it's time, it was good. For those of us who were children when it was originally released, it will remain timeless. But I am not certain that children today, would find it as relatable.",4,Schroder and Voigt,1275350400,"06 1, 2010",2010,2582,"['movie', 'local', 'library', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'commentary', 'Schroder', 'Voigt', 'were', 'couple', 'things', 'stood', 'out', 'unfinished', 'starters', 'package', 'TJ', 'gave', 'Champ', 'beginning', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'brought', 'back', 'flick', 'end', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'happened', '2K', 'Champ', 'asked', 'Annie', 'order', 'save', 'horse', 'Where', 'did', 'go', 'Other', 'two', 'things', 'movie', 'was', 'fairly', 'good', 'movie', 'late', ""'70s.TJ"", 'Rick', 'Schroder', 'was', 'apparently', 'Schroders', 'first', 'movie', 'provided', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'were', 'couple', 'reviewers', 'who', 'said', 'character', 'portrayed', 'child', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'normal', '8', 'year', 'old', 'TJ', 'character', 'HAD', 'be', 'more', 'mature', 'normal', '8', 'year', 'old', 'was', 'only', 'child', 'single', 'father', 'who', 'struggled', 'gambling', 'alcohol', 'TJ', 'had', 'take', 'more', 'maturity', 'make', 'up', 'what', 'Champ', 'lacked', 'are', 'many', 'children', 'similar', 'situations', 'who', 'also', 'exude', 'more', 'maturity', 'peers.Annie', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'confrontation', 'Champ', 'Annie', 'barn', 'Lady', 'injured', 'was', 'sub-par', 'confusing', 'Part', 'time', 'Annie', 'laughing', 'director', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'something', '.because', 'interaction', 'two', 'characters', 'was', 'physically', 'confrontational', 'Champ', 'man-handling', 'seemed', 'sickly', 'un-natural', 'character', 'go', 'laughing', 'crying', 'screaming', 'split', 'second', 'additional', 'action', 'two', 'vastly', 'different', 'responses.Finally', 'Champ', 'Jon', 'Voigt', 'confess', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'Jon', 'early', 'work', 'movie', 'earliest', 'work', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'was', 'impressed', 'depth', 'was', 'able', 'give', 'character', 'when', 'end', 'Annie', 'had', 'come', 'barn', 'Champ', 'became', 'really', 'vulnerable', 'asking', 'come', 'back', ""'ll"", 'give', 'second', 'chance', 'refusal', 'immediately', 'bravado', 'returned.I', 'was', 'impressed', 'interaction', 'Schroder', 'Voigt', 'movie', 'was', 'compounded', 'when', 'listening', 'two', 'commentary', 'movie', 'However', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'Dunaway', 'performance', 'much', 'seemed', 'more', 'mentally', 'off', 'Champ', 'was.It', 'definitely', 'different', 'style', 'movie', 'coming', 'out', 'today', 'time', 'was', 'good', 'who', 'were', 'children', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'will', 'remain', 'timeless', 'am', 'not', 'certain', 'children', 'today', 'would', 'find', 'relatable']",N/A

Sarhan ""matured reviewer""","[14, 14]","The Champ is an astounding motion picture directed by Franco Zeffirelli with outstanding performances by Jon Voight, Faye Dunaway and the unbelievably convincing Ricky Schroder.The movie is the best intimate melodramatic tearjerker that I have ever seen. One view of this film will leave you with a lump in your throat and teary eyes, the next viewings will just leave you in plain tears. Yes, its that kind of movie that you'd see more than once and still feel engaged.Jon Voight plays former boxer Billy Flynn who is down on his luck raising his son TJ, played by Schroder, alone after his wife, played by Dunaway, left him and the boy and went on to marry a millionaire after he falls out of his life of boxing, doctor's orders. The movie brings you close to the lives of all three of these characters, you feel their pain, their grief, and their emptiness. Billy has turned to drinking to escape the pain of not being able to return to boxing to support a family. TJ does not know his mother since she left him when he was still an infant, and still sees his deadbeat father as a hero, calling him 'champ'. Faye Dunaway's character can't seem to cope with the fact that her son has grown up believing she is dead and can only take him as a friend after bumping into him at a horserace, the horse that 'champ' bought him was competing in this race. The story begins to unfold when the three characters enter each other's lives again.What's more beautiful about this movie is its musical score. The music is really another character in the film, and is quite breathtaking.Highly RecommendedA",5,The one movie that still makes me cry,1072310400,"12 25, 2003",2003,1593,"['Champ', 'astounding', 'motion', 'picture', 'directed', 'Franco', 'Zeffirelli', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'unbelievably', 'convincing', 'Ricky', 'Schroder.The', 'movie', 'best', 'intimate', 'melodramatic', 'tearjerker', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'One', 'view', 'film', 'will', 'leave', 'lump', 'throat', 'teary', 'eyes', 'next', 'viewings', 'will', 'just', 'leave', 'plain', 'tears', 'Yes', 'kind', 'movie', ""'d"", 'see', 'more', 'once', 'still', 'feel', 'engaged.Jon', 'Voight', 'former', 'boxer', 'Billy', 'Flynn', 'who', 'down', 'luck', 'raising', 'son', 'TJ', 'played', 'Schroder', 'alone', 'wife', 'played', 'Dunaway', 'left', 'boy', 'went', 'marry', 'millionaire', 'life', 'boxing', 'doctor', 'orders', 'movie', 'close', 'lives', 'three', 'characters', 'feel', 'pain', 'grief', 'emptiness', 'Billy', 'turned', 'drinking', 'escape', 'pain', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'return', 'boxing', 'support', 'family', 'TJ', 'not', 'know', 'mother', 'left', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'infant', 'still', 'deadbeat', 'father', 'hero', 'calling', ""'champ"", 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'cope', 'fact', 'son', 'grown', 'up', 'believing', 'dead', 'can', 'only', 'take', 'friend', 'bumping', 'horserace', 'horse', ""'champ"", 'bought', 'was', 'competing', 'race', 'story', 'unfold', 'when', 'three', 'characters', 'enter', 'other', 'lives', 'again.What', 'more', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'musical', 'score', 'music', 'really', 'character', 'film', 'quite', 'breathtaking.Highly', 'RecommendedA']",N/A

Voight is believable both as a boxer and as a well-intentioned screw-up of a dad, and Schroder is a fine young actor (and irresistibly adorable), especially since its a custody battle that ends up costing a parents life in the long run where everybody becomes a loser.This flick takes me back to memory lane to when I was 6 years old in the 1st grade during its theatrical release in the Spring of 1979 and when I saw it for the very first time on HBO in the Summer of 1980 and it made me and my mother cry.",3,Before Rick Schroeder was a star,1396569600,"04 4, 2014",2014,1296,"['young', 'Rick', 'Schroeder', 'cute-as-all-get-out', 'of-film', 'debut', 'drama', 'flick', 'ex-boxing', 'champion', 'KO', ""'d"", 'gambling', 'booze', 'Billy', 'Flynn', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'ring', 'win', 'custody', 'son', 'TJ', 'Flynn', 'Rick', 'Schroeder', 'when', 'wealthy', 'estranged', 'ex-wife', 'Annie', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'who', 'abandoned', 'years', 'ago', 'abruptly', 'back', 'picture', 'trying', 'lure', 'TJ', 'away', 'Billy', 'Billy', 'struggling', 'provide', 'boy.The', 'ups', 'downs', 'devoted', 'co-dependent', 'pair', 'might', 'be', 'enough', 'movie', 'own', 'soon', 'enough', 'Annie', 'up', 'displays', 'strangely', 'protective', 'interest', 'T.J.Though', 'plot', 'around', 'too', 'much', 'quite', 'hold', 'together', 'CHAMP', 'certainly', 'affecting', '3', 'leads', 'take', 'film', 'so', 'earnestly', 'somehow', 'Voight', 'believable', 'boxer', 'well-intentioned', 'screw-up', 'dad', 'Schroder', 'fine', 'young', 'actor', 'irresistibly', 'adorable', 'especially', 'custody', 'battle', 'up', 'costing', 'parents', 'life', 'long', 'run', 'where', 'everybody', 'loser.This', 'flick', 'back', 'memory', 'lane', 'when', 'was', '6', 'years', 'old', '1st', 'grade', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Spring', '1979', 'when', 'saw', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'HBO', 'Summer', '1980', 'made', 'mother', 'cry']",N/A

Admittedly, everyone in the movie is a bit 'too' sincere/earnest/honest, a quality the media would like us to believe vanished forever with the 1970's (it doesn't sell products), but which is actually timeless and has gone nowhere.The issues this movie deals with are timeless as well (divorce, father/son relationships, etc.) and are still completely valid today.  An excellent 'family' film (which means you, unless you were born in a test tube).

276698,A3CHIONKNQ0MMR,6301966023,"Tom ""A music and movie  lover""","[14, 14]","I remember seeing this movie in the theater when I was 16.  I still recall that everybody there was crying by the end.  I don't think I've seen a performance by a child star that can rival little Ricky Schroder's effort in this film.  This was his first acting job and he stole the show with what was easily an Oscar winning performance.  This movie is a remake of an older film by the same title made back in the early 1930's; this remake is superior on all counts.  Jackie Cooper, then age nine played the role covered here by Schroder, who turned eight, while on the set.  Wallace Beerey played the title role done here by Jon Voight.  The film is about as perfect as any drama could hope to be because it deals so honestly with very real family issues.  Especially the love of a father for his son.  The events told in the story could happen to anyone.  Perhaps that's why it was such a success in the theaters.  Performaces by all the actors were simply fantastic, but again Schroder's will leave you stunned.  I've never been able to get through this film without tearing up; as it's unquestionably, one of the most powerfully emotional films ever made.I highly recommend it to everyone.  The DVD has a very honest and insightful audio commentary by both Voight and Schroder. Their comments actually reinforce the picture's true emotional power; and together, they recall special moments that clearly indicate to it's viewers, why this movie will always stand the test of time.

276700,AP3B615GM191G,6301966023,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","After just recently viewing this 1979 film ""The Champ"", it has a little bit in common with three more contemporary films:-Million Dollar Baby (for the gritty, real-world perspective that director Franco Zeffirelli brings to the movie)-Rocky (for the underdog story)-Over The Top (for the father/son relationship and custody battle)For a basic plot summary, ""The Champ"" tells the story of Billy (Jon Voight) and his son TJ (Ricky Schroder).  Though Billy is adored by the best son a father could ever want in TJ, Billy is also a compulsive gambler and drinker, thus not being able to provide the best environment for the young boy.  When the boy's mother (Faye Dunaway) comes back into the picture, Billy (once a professional boxer) decides to step back into the ring again to try and make a few more big paydays to take care of his beloved boy.There are a few things that this film doesn't quite nail, but they are so far overshadowed by what it does right:-The acting is terrific.  Schroder turns in perhaps the greatest child-star performance of all-time, while Voight and Dunaway also turn in dramatic and emotional roles.-The direction of Zeffirelli is, much like a modern-day Clint Eastwood, very realistic and down-to-earth.  Much like life, there are shades of grey thrown into every decision the main characters do or do not make.  It isn't just a wild soap opera with easily distinguished bad guys and heroes.-This film also pulls at the male heartstrings (yes, they do exist!) like almost no other.  The themes of the father/son relationship and Billy's enduring struggle with gambling/alcohol, all eventually summed up in a sporting-atmosphere that men can relate to, create a perfect storm of male emotion that is difficult to not get overwhelmed by.  If you don't shed a tear when the credits roll, you'll have to question whether you are alive at all.Overall, this is one of the better dramas you will ever watch.  The overall screenplay could have been a bit tighter, but the emotional scenes more than make up for those shortcomings.  Make sure to watch with the Kleenex box by the couch.
