639364,A1II2ZRPKZAQQD,B00005JO4H,"Amy Mcfarland ""Mom of 2""","[12, 13]","My son was so excited to see this at the video store last night.  We love the muppets, so we gave it a try.  There were several comments throughout the first 30 minutes that seemed inappropriate, and after 30 minutes we finally had to turn it off.First off, it did have a few cute spots.  Instead of having Toto as a dog, Dorothy has a shrimp named Toto.  Dorothy is still in Kansas, but instead of dreaming she is exploring outside the farm, Dorothy is a waitress in a small-town diner, dreaming of a career as a singer.  Cute concept, and I really thought this movie had great potential.The part that gets to me is that there are SO many inappropriate, adult comments, I don't know why this is marketed as a children's movie, or why the muppets were even involved.  Just as one example, Dorothy refuses to wear the witch's magic shoes and starts a bratty little tirade, until Miss Piggy explains they are from a top-name designer.  Dorothy jumps at the chance to wear them then, and exclaims they make her feel SEXY.  Are you kidding???  I was watching this movie with a 5-year old! The first 30 minutes of the movie were riddled with such comments.

I watched this with my niece and it was a waste of time.  I was bored out of mind and had to ask myself, ""What happened?"" What happened to ""The Great Muppet Caper"" and ""The Muppets Take Manahattan""? Ashanti can't sing, dance, or act to save her life. She pretty much looks like a floozy throughout the movie, with her low-rider jeans and short skirts. The voices of  Fozzy and Miss Piggy sounded waaaaayyy too much alike.  You would assume that this movie would be for children, but it has too many adult references  in it. In one scene, the wizard was in the form of a so-called beautiful woman. This  computer generated woman's (...) were spilling out of her skimpy top! I said to my mom,""Look at this trash they have on here! Kids are watching this!"" Then there was this one out of place scene where Kermit and Quentin Tarantino are in a boardroom and Quentin is giving these graphic ideas on how to kill the Wicked Witch. I thought to myself, ""What was the point of that?"" Anyway, the Muppets are like everyone else: slap some B.S. together  and make a few bucks off it.

I recall episodes where Sylvester Stallone and Vincent Price actually sang.  Clearly, the muppets were doing their own thing, they weren't interested in being ""hip.""Fast forward to ""Muppets Wizard of Oz.""  Singing flavor-of-the-moment Ahsanti stars as Dorothy, a Kansas waitress with visions of stardom.  As the opening credits roll, she sings a forgettable song in music-video format (complete with a music video reference).  Later, she tells her Aunt 'Em that she wants to go to Hollywood and learn Kaballa, a pop-cultural reference that was already dated by the time of the movie's release.Soon, Dorothy is whisked off to Oz, a land where pop cultural references pile up like flying monkey guano.  Among these is Gonzo explaining to Pepe that the buttons he is pushing on his chest are his nipples.  This comment may be the last gasp of the edginess that once made the muppets great.  Later, Dorothy steps into a make-over machine and comes out as the talentless daughter of Ozzy Osboune (she's been re-born, or rather, Oz-born, yuck yuck).  I'm sure that joke will be twice as funny to new viewers in a year or two, right?Dorothy eventually announces that she wants to go home, perhaps she was driven off by the staggeringly unfunny jokes that crop up on all sides (see the Osbourne joke above).  Although her character elicits no sympathy, the audience wishes her to return home too, just so we can end the movie.Once, long ago, the muppets succeeded because they made their own rules.  This is why their show (season 1 recently released on DVD) and their early movies have retained their charm for the past several decades.

It could have been funnier and it definitely is not their best work. At times the story is formulaic with little thought added. That being said it is still a fun family movie. There is plenty of material to keep you laughing. Parents will like the subtle humor and kids will like it just because there are muppets. All in all a worthwhile movie to watch.For those that have stated a problem with the adult-oriented humor get over it. The muppets have always done this. I would say that Muppets Take Manhattan has at least as much, if not more, adult oriented humor. Also it is a lot more apparent. I don't remeber the name of the muppet but the blond one states that she won't take off her clothes even if it is done artfully. that is a whole lot more obvious than anything a kid would pick up on in Oz.The Muppets have always been an adult geared show in the guise of a kid's program.  To now try to sanitize and turn it into something for a 3 year old would completely ruin their magic.  Need I remind everyone that Alice Cooper was once on the show, ""Welcome to my nightmare"", also Ozzie Osborne ""Born to be Wild."" .

639385,A26O0T192IBKY1,B00005JO4H,J. Alford,"[3, 3]","After seeing nearly every other movie verion of Wizard Of Oz, I figured I might as well get around to doing the Muppets one too. Since Kermit and friends already knocked over A Christmas Carol and Treasure Island, it was probably going to be this or an Alice In Wonderland adaptation. Originally meant to be a made-for-TV movie, this was released on DVD as an extended feature with some material not used in the original broadcast, which included some rather mature stuff for an intended ""family"" film. For this time around, Dorothy Gale(played by Ashanti)is a young waitress(did Tin Man steal this?)who wants to be a pop singer. After failing to get it to an audition for the Muppets, Dorothy heads back home to her trailer park, which gets swept off to Oz by a tornado. Once there, her pet prawn Toto(yep, prawn)has evolved into a larger talking prawn. The Munchkins are actually rats, although they're called Munchkins here, who are watched over by the Good Witch of the North(i.e. Miss Piggy). BTW, Piggy plays all the Witches in this. She sends Dorothy off to see the Wizard with her dead sisters' shoes. Along the way, Dorothy befriends Scarecrow(Kermit), Tin Man(Gonzo), and the Lion(Fozzie). They manage to get past the heckling Kalidahs(Statler and Waldorf), and the Poppyfield nightclub where the Electric Mayhem jam. After finally arriving at the Emerald City, each of our heroes go in to see the Wizard which takes on a different form for each one. The big Wiz tells them to get the Wicked Witch of the West's magic eye. The Witch has Piggy looking like Cher in biker gear, and uses her magic cap to command the flying monkeys(here a biker gang)to get Dorothy. Dorothy manages to push the Witch into a bathtub which was supposed to be filled with bottled water, but instead melts her. Dorothy and the others take the eye back to the Wizard, who is revealed to be a special effects expert from Hollywood and not really a wizard. He however makes it possible for Dorothy to be a celebrity in Oz, and gives the others their own hearts' desires. Dorothy realizes that she really wants to go back home though, so they head back to Munchkinland to get help from Glinda(also Piggy). She then uses her magic footwear to go back to Kansas, where the Muppets hire her on their Star Search ripoff show. This was ultimately a decent movie, although it seemed to be a bit lacking in both style and substance from most Muppet productions. There was just too many pop culture parodies thrown in, like it was trying too much to be like Shrek. Plus, there was some stuff in this that was definately not for kids, like the phrase ""bitchslap"", or Kermit bringing up The Passion while being nailed up on the pole as a scarecrow. Ashanti wasn't bad as Dorothy, which apparently helped her later on to get in a recent production of The Wiz. I was mostly impressed though that the movie actually followed the original novel a little more than most adaptations did, like the East Witch being called Tattypoo which didn't even come up until the Ruth Thompson novels, as well as the West Witch only having one eye.

After all, Disney had now taken over Jim Henson Productions and in my opinion the best of the muppets was with Disney (eg. The Muppet Christmas Carol, Muppet Treasure Island, Muppet Fairy Tales). I also love nything to do with OZ. MGM's The Wizard Of Oz is a classic, Return To Oz was great and the Broadway musical Wicked was simply amazing. So things were looking bright.I couldn't have been more disappointed. The version of the story was weak, the songs were not catchy, and it just wasn't very funny.(Here's an idea Disney: Do a Muppet musical of Robin Hood- with Kermit as Robin, Miss Piggy as Marion, Robin the Frog as Will, etc, etc, along with a better plot and catchier songs- I suggest the song writers from Pooh's Grand Adventure. I have lots of ideas. Get in contact for more details Disney.)Now back to the review. I could totally understand Ashanti being cast as Dorothy. I mean, in 1997 Brandy had been great in Disney's live action version of Cinderella. Unfortunately although Ashanti is a great singer, she doesn't get good enough songs to sing to, and she doesn't show that much promise as an actress here. I'm sorry to say that cos I wanted her to be brilliant.To be fair, there are some highlights. Having Pepe (the ""shrimp"") as Toto was nice, and having the poppy fields actually be a nightclub was quite original.

The shot is stimulating and convincing.True, the songs were not nearly as catchy as they should've been, but that is made up for with a somewhat sick sense of humor.

We have the tin man (Gonzo the robot) showing off his cell phone/nose; someone inquires about the buttons on his chest, and he replies, ""Oh, those are my nipples."" There's the Poppy Field night club, the wizard masquarading as a seductive chicken, the Flying Monkeys Hog Gang (We're just middle-aged motorcycle enthusiasts!""), and of course: Miss Piggy as the domanitrix Witch of the West.The scene where the trap opens in front of Dorothy, not underneath, is far funnier than the similar scene in Team America.

It all starts with the writing, obviously this was written by someone who knows little about the Muppets and their humor. There is absolutely no charm or class in this entire film. Ashanti is passible at best, the muppets have no real personality, the effects are an atrocious mix of bad lighting and ""Sesame Street"" like sets. It also would have been nice to have the music composed by someone who knew what they were doing. If you're going to make a musical, get someone who can do some catchy tunes. Bottom line, if you're an Oz fan or a Muppets fan...give it a once over, but no promises.

639408,A1FT7QFKNHL9DT,B00005JO4H,Wolfe Moffat,"[33, 39]","OK, who do I think I am saying such a thing about a Muppet movie? Hey, I've watched enough Muppets to know what's good and what's funny. This ain't it, and it isn't even close. Hey, you know the saying about not judging a book by the cover. The same applies to flicks, because the cover of this alone invites you to an all new world of the classic we've loved for years. I seriously wonder how ""Muppet Treasure Island"" was so awesome and THIS was so bad. It sucked, plain and simple! I'm thankful that we were able to borrow this from our local library before dishing out our money for this. By the way, the extra star IS simply for potential alone. How does it manage to screw up? Hey, read on!You think of the Muppets, you're thinkin' ha ha ha!! You watch this and your like eh heh heh, it isn't that funny, and it isn't that innovative. Freakin' Quentin Tarantino made it all the more horrific! But ok, let's take a look at all the potential that could've made this great. Here we go! The opening song with Dorothy was good. But where did it flop? I personally don't know, but it did indeed FLOP. Kermit the Frog is Scarecrow. And of course he has his moments, but it doesn't hit the bulls eye, and misses the mark completely. Gonzo the Great is Tin-Man. Hey, I said this sucked for a reason. Because when Gonzo can point to knobs on his chest and say, ""Those are my nipples"" with no humorous effect, I can say THIS SUCKS!! Yeah, that's a direct quote from this, I ACTUALLY WATCHED IT! OK? I'll continue. My daughter loves Gonzo, and she was gone by this point. Gonzo wasn't funny. Fozzy Bear as Cowardly Lion, and it could've been great. I'll spare you any details. It wasn't too pretty. I thought it might be tolerable when Statler and Waldorf finally made their intro with their crack or two. Statler and Waldorf's heckling MADE Muppets better every time. This time they made it worse. The biggest disappointment I thought was Miss Piggy, not just as the Wicked Witch, but as ALL THE WITCHES. Now for a little while, it worked. But after some time, she got crappy too! The monkeys were a disgrace in my opinion.I always saw ""The Wizard of Oz"" as a thing of beauty, of wonder and enchantment. Of AWE most of the time! I saw this as sheer stupidity! Like I said, they made ""Treasure Island"" work, and it happens to be a BIG favorite of my daughter's. This just gave her reason to play with her toys. Hey, if we're going to watch The Muppets, give us what we're used to. And that's entertainment! The Muppets are all about the unexpected, and madness hilarity, but they tried WAY too hard this time. It sucks, and I won't waste my time and money on it. No apologies.",2,"Absolutely, postively SCREAMED potential.
