828171,A3DGB4HN3QCGAL,B00029NLGO,A. Burchfield,"[3, 3]","I watched this movie, on TV, expecting it to be all right but not great- aimed at young teen girls. It is that but it actually does the story pretty well anyway.The plot is about an irresponsible, somewhat lazy, fictional Danish Crown Prince who decides to go to Wisconsin after seeing a commercial for a video of Wisconsin college girls going topless for some stupid video. At the university he meets a very serious minded girl who has no time for someone like him (he's using an assumed name and she doesn't know who he really is).Things go badly for a while but gradually thaw as she needs help with her Shakespeare class (he's an expert at it)and it seems he needs her help in a lot of things. He ends up being invited to her home for Thanksgiving break and gets along really well with everyone, the romance really gets started then.Back at school things go well until the paparazzi get some incriminating photos of the two of them. Paige is furious when she finds out that ""Eddie"" is actually Crown Prince Edvard of Denmark and ends the relationship. At semester's end he goes back home to his royal duties and Paige finds that she can't bear to be without him.From here on the movie does get kind of rushed and somewhat weak as she instantly decides to rush off to Denmark (with one small piece of luggage)with the aid of her own and her friends combined credit cards paying for a ticket. Once in Denmark her cab is stopped by what turns out to be a Royal parade. Paige gets out and tries to get Eddie's attention but can't. The crowd recognizes her from all the tabloid pictures and starts chanting her name, Eddie hears and rides his horse over to pick her up. Things really blur along  but Paige seems to get along with most everyone except the Queen and even they are all right once the Queen sees what a positive influence Paige has been on Edvard. At almost the end of the movie Paige suddenly gets cold feet and breaks off the engagement, leaving Denmark as the now King Edvard III  makes a speech to his subjects. Some months later Paige has graduated and can now go on to medical school as she's always wanted. She turns at hearing some Shakespeare, Edvard is there, he tells her he'll wait for her, she accepts his proposal.The Denmark on part of the movie was less than half of the story and far too rushed along but the happy ending was nice.One thing I found interesting was when the queen took Paige into the royal vault to try on some jewelry for some event. I remember thinking that the ""Harry Winston"" necklace she tried on was probably worth the price of her father's farm, turns out in the credits that Harry Winston did supply the jewelry shown.",3,A lot better than I expected it to be,1096243200,"09 27, 2004",2004,2671,"['watched', 'movie', 'TV', 'expecting', 'be', 'right', 'not', 'great-', 'aimed', 'young', 'teen', 'girls', 'actually', 'story', 'pretty', 'well', 'anyway.The', 'plot', 'irresponsible', 'somewhat', 'lazy', 'fictional', 'Danish', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'who', 'go', 'Wisconsin', 'seeing', 'commercial', 'video', 'Wisconsin', 'college', 'girls', 'going', 'topless', 'stupid', 'video', 'university', 'very', 'serious', 'minded', 'girl', 'who', 'time', 'someone', 'using', 'assumed', 'name', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'really', '.Things', 'go', 'badly', 'while', 'gradually', 'thaw', 'help', 'Shakespeare', 'class', 'expert', 'help', 'lot', 'things', 'up', 'being', 'invited', 'home', 'Thanksgiving', 'break', 'along', 'really', 'well', 'everyone', 'romance', 'really', 'started', 'then.Back', 'school', 'things', 'go', 'well', 'paparazzi', 'get', 'incriminating', 'photos', 'two', 'Paige', 'furious', 'when', 'out', 'Eddie', 'actually', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Edvard', 'Denmark', 'relationship', 'semester', 'end', 'back', 'home', 'royal', 'duties', 'Paige', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bear', 'be', 'him.From', 'here', 'movie', 'get', 'kind', 'rushed', 'somewhat', 'weak', 'instantly', 'rush', 'off', 'Denmark', 'one', 'small', 'piece', 'luggage', 'aid', 'own', 'friends', 'combined', 'credit', 'cards', 'paying', 'ticket', 'Once', 'Denmark', 'cab', 'stopped', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'Royal', 'parade', 'Paige', 'out', 'tries', 'get', 'Eddie', 'attention', 'ca', ""n't"", 'crowd', 'tabloid', 'pictures', 'chanting', 'name', 'Eddie', 'horse', 'pick', 'up', 'Things', 'really', 'blur', 'along', 'Paige', 'get', 'along', 'most', 'everyone', 'Queen', 'even', 'are', 'right', 'once', 'Queen', 'what', 'positive', 'influence', 'Paige', 'been', 'Edvard', 'almost', 'end', 'movie', 'Paige', 'suddenly', 'cold', 'feet', 'breaks', 'engagement', 'leaving', 'Denmark', 'now', 'King', 'Edvard', 'III', 'speech', 'subjects', 'months', 'later', 'Paige', 'graduated', 'can', 'now', 'go', 'medical', 'school', 'always', 'wanted', 'hearing', 'Shakespeare', 'Edvard', 'there', ""'ll"", 'wait', 'proposal.The', 'Denmark', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'less', 'half', 'story', 'far', 'too', 'rushed', 'happy', 'ending', 'was', 'nice.One', 'thing', 'found', 'interesting', 'was', 'when', 'queen', 'took', 'Paige', 'royal', 'vault', 'try', 'jewelry', 'event', 'remember', 'thinking', 'Harry', 'Winston', 'necklace', 'tried', 'was', 'probably', 'worth', 'price', 'father', 'farm', 'out', 'credits', 'Harry', 'Winston', 'did', 'supply', 'jewelry', 'shown']",N/A

I didn't absolutely hate it like I did years ago (which is only because it didn't make me hate Julia Stiles all over again due to an unhealthy love of Dexter) but I didn't end the movie feeling like I loved it or hated it, just indifferent to it.  A major point of contention I had with the movie in high school (when I last watched it) was my hatred of her dress for the coronation.  They spent all this time and had a huge designer that boasted that she could create anything (including Chanel and McQueen) and THAT is what they came up with? That hot mess of 5 different colors and.... well, after several years (most of which were spent with subscriptions to Vogue) I actually love that dress and it isn't as awful as I once imagine it was. It's not the mess that was Molly Ringwald's Pretty In Pink dress that I still hate to this day (In fact I have a hard time with that movie because of that dress... and the guy).I now like - and more fully understand - Paige running away to retain some semblance of her own identity and her own goals and dreams.  She doesn't want to walk and bow behind her boyfriend just because he's rich or famous or beautiful or all three (I'm looking at you 'she-who-cannot-exist-without-a-man-Bella-Swan').But the thing that always made me hate this movie is still there. Still so cheesy and ridiculous and awful... That freaking butterfly! I blocked it out, I must have, or else I wouldn't have let the urge to watch it overpower me in such a way.  Was he holding the butterfly the entire time? Do butterflies just come standard with engagement rings? Is there a royal butterfly trainer? It's such a ridiculous, albeit small part, of the movie that I just can't handle it.  I've never understood the romanticism of the butterfly (they're just a bug to me).  But there's no real significance to the butterfly, just that one scene where he presents the ring... and a bug.  And then it's in a jar in her room.  Didn't it fly off to freedom after being trapped in his sweaty hand for 20 minutes, probably praying to whatever deity butterflies pray to that he wouldn't crush it (never mind the fact that the oils from his hands would have ruined it's wings and it never would have flown again).  Was his creepy little man servant hanging out, just out of sight, with a butterfly net so she could have it as a pet?

In his latest scheme to ""blow off some steam"", he decides to head off to America (after seeing the word ""Wisconsin"" plastered across a girls boob while watching a raunchy ""Girls Gone Wild-type"" television commercial) in search of some ""fun"".  The kicker is that his trip turns into something infinitely different than what he expected.While posing as a Danish exchange student on the University of Wisconsin campus, he meets senior Paige, a hardworking farm girl who aspires to go to John Hopkins Medical School.. Their relationship starts out rocky, to say the least, with Paige thinking ""Eddie"" is a spoiled rich boy, and ""Eddie"" trying to do whatever it takes to woo Paige's heart. When the Prince runs out of money, he is forced to find a job and do menial tasks. Paige is failing her Shakespeare class, one that she desperately needs to ace if she is going to graduate, and when she finds out that Eddie is versed in Shakespeare they strike a bargain...she will teache him how to do laundry, if he will help her understand the Sonnets..thus the romance begins. I don't want to disclose anymore of the plot here; I'm sure you can figure out that hey fall in love, but the endingis quite a surprise, very unusual - totally not expected.I want to issue a word of caution for parents - please don't mistake this for a cute teen-type Disney movie. I watched this with my very mature 11-year old and I'm sorry I didn't watch it alone first. In one of the earlier scenes Paige and her friends are shown drinking beer and doing shots (she does one shot).  Hen there's the Girls Gone Wild-type television commercial that went on way too long, and the kissing...There is a LOT of serious kissing in this movie and one scene where the two main characters go at it in the library (the Prince loses his shirt, literally). My point is, according to the standards of our household, I would say this is mature movie. I was not comfortable with the intimacy displayed and the overdone portrayal of the typical ""college"" behavior, but this would not deter me form saying that as a whole. I really liked it. Seeing the Prince mature into a delightful young man because of his relationship with Paige was worth it, as was the fabulous acting by Julia Stiles and Luke Mably.

Before she knows it, Paige is living the life of a princess within a Denmark palace, attending balls and being waited on hand and foot.  But is living a life of royalty worth giving up her personal hopes and dreams?  Or will true love conquer all?Though many of the elements presented herein are quite clich&eacute;, I still found the story to be rather enthralling in an adorably cute, completely unrealistic kind of way.  The Prince & Me is a light-hearted romp through every young girl's fantasy, but it also carries with it an enchanting moral.  Furthermore, it seems as though the generally generic Cinderella-esque plot has been tweaked in such a way as to keep the tale entertaining.  Buried amidst some of the hackneyed tripe is a genuinely noteworthy and heartwarming tale of love, perseverance, and exquisite imagination.Both Julia Stiles and Luke Mably pulled off their roles quite nicely, and seem to work rather well together.  With Ben Miller rounding out the cast as Prince Eddie's personal attendant, and adding the occasional comic relief, the plot and script tend to veer away from the overly-sappy.  The DVD extras include a few deleted scenes, a gag reel, and some short featurettes on some of the film's sequences, which is a nice touch.  This is one of few ""chick-flicks"" to grace my DVD collection, and it's well worth the purchase price.",4,Heartwarming Cinderella Tale,1119571200,"06 24, 2005",2005,2114,"['must', 'admit', 'am', 'generally', 'not', 'one', 'indulge', 'more', 'girly', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'genre', 'However', 'am', 'fan', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'as', 'well', 'occasional', 'insouciant', 'debauchery', 'therefore', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'movie', 'try.The', 'Prince', 'Me', 'classic', 'Cinderella-type', 'tale', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Paige', 'Morgan', 'quaint', 'farm', 'girl', 'mission', 'Paige', 'finish', 'up', 'pre-medical', 'studies', 'University', 'Wisconsin', 'go', 'medical', 'school', 'Johns', 'Hopkins', 'then', 'use', 'knowledge', 'help', 'need', 'globe', 'However', 'when', 'handsome', 'irresponsible', 'Prince', 'Edvard', 'Luke', 'Mably', 'seek', 'solstice', 'UW', 'brief', 'holiday', 'excursion', 'high-profile', 'life', 'kink', 'thrown', 'Paige', 'plans', 'Paige', 'living', 'life', 'princess', 'Denmark', 'palace', 'attending', 'balls', 'being', 'waited', 'hand', 'foot', 'living', 'life', 'royalty', 'worth', 'giving', 'up', 'personal', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'will', 'true', 'love', 'conquer', 'Though', 'many', 'elements', 'presented', 'herein', 'are', 'quite', 'clich', 'eacute', 'still', 'found', 'story', 'be', 'rather', 'enthralling', 'adorably', 'cute', 'completely', 'unrealistic', 'kind', 'way', 'Prince', 'Me', 'light-hearted', 'romp', 'young', 'girl', 'fantasy', 'also', 'enchanting', 'moral', 'Furthermore', 'generally', 'generic', 'Cinderella-esque', 'plot', 'been', 'tweaked', 'such', 'way', 'keep', 'tale', 'entertaining', 'Buried', 'amidst', 'hackneyed', 'tripe', 'genuinely', 'noteworthy', 'heartwarming', 'tale', 'love', 'perseverance', 'exquisite', 'imagination.Both', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Luke', 'Mably', 'pulled', 'off', 'roles', 'quite', 'nicely', 'seem', 'work', 'rather', 'well', 'together', 'Ben', 'Miller', 'rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'Prince', 'Eddie', 'personal', 'attendant', 'adding', 'occasional', 'comic', 'relief', 'plot', 'script', 'tend', 'veer', 'away', 'overly-sappy', 'DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'gag', 'reel', 'short', 'featurettes', 'film', 'sequences', 'nice', 'touch', 'one', 'few', 'chick-flicks', 'grace', 'DVD', 'collection', 'well', 'purchase', 'price']",N/A

Equal part comedy, romance and drama the movie features some wonderful performances (especially from the supporting cast) and enough light-hearted air to stop the drama from being too overbearing.The movie centers around the romance between a Danish prince and a medical student at the University of Wisconsin.Seems the Danish prince (Edward) is a little restless and (in an apparent reference to the antics of Britain's Princes William and Harry) is feeling the pressure of the expectations lofted upon him and engaging in car races and dalliances with a number of girls.Following a particularly embarrassing incident and in the belief that American girls are wild and exhibitionist, Edward persuades his parents to allow him to attend classes in Wisconsin. His intentions are however hardly noble. In fact his persistence in visiting America's Dairyland comes from a television commercial for one of those Girls Gone Wild-type videos that gives Edward the impression that Wisconsin girls are easy - boy is he in for a shock.It's not long after arriving at Wisconsin that he realizes that the campus is not populated entirely by free-wheeling party girls and in fact the one girl who catches his eye in particular is a very studious medical student (played with warmth and charm by Julia Stiles).There is a real wicked streak of comedy in here, mostly supplied by the supporting characters such as Edward's bemused and disdainful man servant or his sloth-some roommate. But, what this movie does best is romantic comedy.Of particular joy is watching Edward grow into the responsibilities of being a future King as his father (played by the amazing James Fox) slips further into decline.For those who enjoyed movies such as ""Boys and Girls"" or ""Down to You"" (which also featured Stiles) then this is a movie you will enjoy.

The love between them is so strong that Paige can't forget thinking about Eddie and decided to go to Denmark to find him. Though at first she leaves him after realizing that she's not ready to be the Queen of Denmark, but Evard still wants to be with her and go to find Paige after she ends her medical course.

828235,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00029NLGO,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","THE PRINCE AND ME (2004, 111 minutes) is a silly teen-targeted story of a bored Prince of Denmark Edvard Valdemar (a truly smoking hot Luke Mably) deciding to go to college in Wisconsin (I assume it's Madison) based on one of those ""college slut"" videos. His parents, King Harald (James Fox) and Queen Rosalind (an oddly out-of-place Miranda Richardson) are worried about their ne'er-do-well son but they let him go.I'll bet the real monarch, Queen Margrethe II, not to mention her son Crown Prince Frederic, were not amused by this. Though if I recall, Prince Frederic married his commoner wife Princess Mary right at the time of the release of this movie. Also I noted that the scenes filmed in Copenhagen did show Amalienborg in the background. Amalienborg is the actual royal residence.At college, Prince Edvard Valdemar, trying to be incognito, falls for brainy cheesecake Paige (Julia Stiles) who wants to join Doctors Without Borders. That she falls for 'Edward' and soon goes happily skipping back to Denmark with him - well, who watches these things for logic or truth? It's a fun enough premise without actually hurting any real person directly (I suspect differently but, about this, it is best to keep silent).What's left is something of a cross betweenThe Princess DiariesandWhat a Girl Wants- it is unique enough not to really fit anyplace else. Anyway, the most interesting related story is that Mably and another cast member went to the Four Seasons, Toronto, in character, convinced everyone that Mably was the Crown Prince of Denmark and had them all bowing and scraping. True? Like with this film, one must reply, Who cares.All it really did for me (aside from showing me nice shots of Copenhagen, Amsterdam and Toronto) was raise the question of what must be a morganatic marriage versus what must not necessarily be so. Mably is always hot to admire onscreen, so that was nice and I was actually struck by his resemblance to the Family, eyes, hair and everything - but he looks more like the English than the Danish ones. One point: what did bother me deeply was when King Harald apparently abdicated due to illness: suddenly Edvard Valdemar becomes king.That was just plain silly, but it bothered me. I doubt the average audience will know or care. I was disgusted by the slobbering kissing but aside from some Danish swearing this film is clean. I guess filmmakers are drawing closer to that age old question Shakespeare himself often asked: What do royals want, what are they like? There are echoes of Diana Spencer here, yes, but very faint.This is an OK kids' film, barely tolerable for adults, downright insulting to certain adults. But hey, the century was tailor made for that, right?",3,3 stars for effort - and nothing else,1356825600,"12 30, 2012",2012,2713,"['PRINCE', 'ME', '2004', '111', 'minutes', 'silly', 'teen-targeted', 'story', 'bored', 'Prince', 'Denmark', 'Edvard', 'Valdemar', 'truly', 'smoking', 'hot', 'Luke', 'Mably', 'deciding', 'go', 'college', 'Wisconsin', 'assume', 'Madison', 'based', 'one', 'college', 'slut', 'videos', 'parents', 'King', 'Harald', 'James', 'Fox', 'Queen', 'Rosalind', 'oddly', 'out-of-place', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'are', 'worried', ""ne'er-do-well"", 'son', 'let', 'go.I', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'real', 'monarch', 'Queen', 'Margrethe', 'II', 'not', 'mention', 'son', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Frederic', 'were', 'not', 'amused', 'recall', 'Prince', 'Frederic', 'married', 'commoner', 'wife', 'Princess', 'Mary', 'right', 'time', 'release', 'movie', 'Also', 'noted', 'scenes', 'filmed', 'Copenhagen', 'did', 'show', 'Amalienborg', 'background', 'Amalienborg', 'actual', 'royal', 'residence.At', 'college', 'Prince', 'Edvard', 'Valdemar', 'trying', 'be', 'incognito', 'brainy', 'cheesecake', 'Paige', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'who', 'join', 'Doctors', 'Borders', ""'Edward"", 'soon', 'happily', 'skipping', 'back', 'Denmark', 'well', 'who', 'things', 'logic', 'truth', 'fun', 'enough', 'premise', 'actually', 'hurting', 'real', 'person', 'directly', 'suspect', 'differently', 'best', 'keep', 'silent', '.What', 'left', 'something', 'cross', 'betweenThe', 'Princess', 'DiariesandWhat', 'Girl', 'Wants-', 'unique', 'enough', 'not', 'really', 'fit', 'anyplace', 'else', 'Anyway', 'most', 'interesting', 'related', 'story', 'Mably', 'cast', 'member', 'went', 'Four', 'Seasons', 'Toronto', 'character', 'convinced', 'everyone', 'Mably', 'was', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Denmark', 'had', 'bowing', 'scraping', 'True', 'film', 'one', 'must', 'reply', 'Who', 'cares.All', 'really', 'did', 'aside', 'showing', 'nice', 'shots', 'Copenhagen', 'Amsterdam', 'Toronto', 'was', 'raise', 'question', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'morganatic', 'marriage', 'versus', 'what', 'must', 'not', 'necessarily', 'be', 'so', 'Mably', 'always', 'hot', 'admire', 'onscreen', 'was', 'nice', 'was', 'actually', 'struck', 'resemblance', 'Family', 'eyes', 'hair', 'everything', 'more', 'English', 'Danish', 'ones', 'One', 'point', 'what', 'did', 'bother', 'deeply', 'was', 'when', 'King', 'Harald', 'apparently', 'abdicated', 'due', 'illness', 'suddenly', 'Edvard', 'Valdemar', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'silly', 'bothered', 'doubt', 'average', 'audience', 'will', 'know', 'care', 'was', 'disgusted', 'slobbering', 'kissing', 'aside', 'Danish', 'swearing', 'film', 'clean', 'guess', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'drawing', 'closer', 'age', 'old', 'question', 'Shakespeare', 'often', 'asked', 'What', 'do', 'royals', 'want', 'what', 'are', 'are', 'echoes', 'Diana', 'Spencer', 'here', 'yes', 'very', 'faint.This', 'OK', 'kids', 'film', 'barely', 'tolerable', 'adults', 'downright', 'insulting', 'certain', 'adults', 'hey', 'century', 'was', 'tailor', 'made', 'right']",N/A

The actors are a little young but this is definately not what I would consider teenage comedy fluff.  In fact I would cancel out the comedy part and put it down as a delightful romance movie.The acting was superb.  I love Julia Stiles and Luke Mably and there is a spark bwtween them.  The plot was excellent.  This show did not try to dumb it down for the audience, the ending was slightly awkard but on the whole I think it's the best romance movie I've seen in the past few years.SPOLIERSPremise: Prince of Denmark: playboy, spoiled.  Farmgirl: intelligent, hardworking and trying to get into med school.  Prince decides he needs a change of pace, sees a commercial about ""Wild Girls of Wisconsin"" and so enrolls into school there.  (OK the reasoning was pretty darn weak, esp for a prince but he's supposed to be shallow)They meet, he's a jackass and she hates him on sight. They somehow end up in a Bio Chemistry lab class which is wierd cos why would he take Bio Chem? Anyway the show really picks up from here on and seeing them develop the relationship over 4-5 months which is how long the fall semester is. I especially love the trip they take over thanksgiving to her parent's farm.Then things fall apart, she discovers he's a prince, they part even though he says he loves her.  She regreats it and flies all the way to Denmark.  He whisks her off on his horse in a passing parade.  They get engaged.Here's the excellent part, most shows end here, but this one tries to be realistic and she decides to fulfill her dreams of being a doctor, and he becomes king of Denmark.  Tears flow.  And then a happy ending of course.  The method the ending came about was my only gripe about the show.  Honestly, the King of Denmark (or any king) being so... needy was a little hard to take.  He really looks miserable when he said I need/want you and will wait 5-7 years till she becomes a doctor.

Characters such as Charming Prince and Dutiful Farm Maid (duly accompanied by king, queen, and a totally hilarious servant who greatly resembles the role of Pussy in Boots), fairy tale situations such as quests, tests and infatuations, mix in this story to present a situation in which a highly focused, ambitious, hard-working girl of our times (Paige)faces a tough choice indeed: either to follow her ideals and the path she's been laboriously creating through very hard work (which involves studying at medical school and then working for Doctors without Borders), or follow her heart and run after the dashingly handsome classmate she has fallen in love with (and who has turned out to be nothing less than the -for real- Prince of Denmark).And so, enters literary language, giving us several hilarious literary hints and winks at the conclusion the story is leading us to. Actually, literature plays the role of the fairy godmother, helping and guiding Paige (who believes literature is a useless vestige of past times) in her decissions. The most important example of this is quite early in the story, in a moment of what should be routine laundry making for the main characters, but which ends up turned into a moment of romance through the magic of  Shakespeare (some fairy!!). When Edvar (the Prince of Denmark) passionately defends Hamlet (the Prince of Denmark), we begin to see this character is evolving from play-boy royal rake to royal grown-up. But when he explains metaphor to Paige through one of Shakespeare's love sonnets, we literally see the sparks of love. Some really wonderful acting and directing in this scene, too.When Edvar explains the imagery of this sonnet, we are given the main theme of the film -even the sun (reason) cannot shine through the clouds of Heaven (love)-. And the fact that Paige  understands this message of the sonnet (that love makes us blind) does not necessarily mean she thinks this can be applied to her own life. In fact, it is also Shakespeare who convinces her, through discussing Othello in a final literature exam, that she must grab the opportunity and run after her love.And once in Denmark everything seems out of a fairy tale, but....let's just say that the film ends as it should: with the sun shining brightly (see Shakespeare).""Thus you, pretty girls, out thereListen carefully and beware,When Prince charming comes aroundJust be sure to stand your ground;For she deserves not True Love's giftsWho from her very Essence drifts""",5,The uses of fairy tale,1111104000,"03 18, 2005",2005,2644,"['film', 'delicious', 'way', 'prove', 'languages', 'fairy', 'tale', 'literary', 'classics', 'are', 'universal', 'greatly', 'effective', 'modern', 'world', 'Characters', 'such', 'Charming', 'Prince', 'Dutiful', 'Farm', 'Maid', 'duly', 'accompanied', 'king', 'queen', 'totally', 'hilarious', 'servant', 'who', 'greatly', 'role', 'Pussy', 'Boots', 'fairy', 'tale', 'situations', 'such', 'quests', 'tests', 'infatuations', 'mix', 'story', 'present', 'situation', 'highly', 'focused', 'ambitious', 'hard-working', 'girl', 'times', 'Paige', 'tough', 'choice', 'indeed', 'follow', 'ideals', 'path', 'been', 'laboriously', 'creating', 'very', 'hard', 'work', 'studying', 'medical', 'school', 'then', 'working', 'Doctors', 'Borders', 'follow', 'heart', 'run', 'dashingly', 'handsome', 'classmate', 'fallen', 'love', 'who', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'nothing', 'less', '-for', 'real-', 'Prince', 'Denmark', '.And', 'so', 'enters', 'literary', 'language', 'giving', 'several', 'hilarious', 'literary', 'hints', 'winks', 'conclusion', 'story', 'leading', 'Actually', 'literature', 'role', 'fairy', 'godmother', 'helping', 'guiding', 'Paige', 'who', 'literature', 'useless', 'vestige', 'past', 'times', 'decissions', 'most', 'important', 'example', 'quite', 'early', 'story', 'moment', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'routine', 'laundry', 'making', 'main', 'characters', 'up', 'turned', 'moment', 'romance', 'magic', 'Shakespeare', 'fairy', 'When', 'Edvar', 'Prince', 'Denmark', 'passionately', 'Hamlet', 'Prince', 'Denmark', 'begin', 'see', 'character', 'evolving', 'play-boy', 'royal', 'rake', 'royal', 'grown-up', 'when', 'metaphor', 'Paige', 'one', 'Shakespeare', 'love', 'sonnets', 'literally', 'see', 'sparks', 'love', 'really', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'directing', 'scene', 'too.When', 'Edvar', 'imagery', 'sonnet', 'are', 'given', 'main', 'theme', 'film', 'sun', 'reason', 'can', 'not', 'shine', 'clouds', 'Heaven', 'love', 'fact', 'Paige', 'message', 'sonnet', 'love', 'blind', 'not', 'necessarily', 'mean', 'can', 'be', 'applied', 'own', 'life', 'fact', 'also', 'Shakespeare', 'who', 'discussing', 'Othello', 'final', 'literature', 'exam', 'must', 'grab', 'opportunity', 'run', 'love.And', 'once', 'Denmark', 'everything', 'fairy', 'tale', '.let', 'just', 'say', 'film', 'should', 'sun', 'shining', 'brightly', 'see', 'Shakespeare', 'Thus', 'pretty', 'girls', 'out', 'thereListen', 'carefully', 'beware', 'When', 'Prince', 'charming', 'aroundJust', 'be', 'sure', 'stand', 'ground', 'not', 'True', 'Love', 'giftsWho', 'very', 'Essence', 'drifts']",N/A

The college scenes in Wisconsin are 100% Americana, and then the camera switches the story to Denmark and royalty never seemed so beautiful.

Perskie ""ceruleana""","[35, 45]","I'm a sucker for romance and the Cinderella story is one of my favorites - however, there are just so many ways this tale can be told before it gets really old. Director Martha Coolidge gets off to a good start, updating the fairy tale to the 21st century, with our prince from Denmark, not Hamlet(ish) at all, but a very decisive, spoiled and sexy Prince Edvard Valdemar Dangaard (Luke Mably). He really looks royal and is very hunky. Paige Morgan, (played by the lovely Julia Stiles), is the love interest and a premed student at the University of Wisconsin. She's a farm girl who is very focused on a career in medicine with, perhaps, a post-grad stint working with ""Doctors Without Borders."" Paige has a plan, and early marriage is not on her to-do list. Edvard, bored in Denmark, views a TV commercial, ""Wild Girls of the Midwest,"" and decides that a year at a Wisconsin university might be just the experience to help him mature and settle down. He plans to attend classes undercover, so to speak. He definitely does not want the royal treatment.OK! Predictable, but still amusing and entertaining, the studious female meets Eddie, playboy prince incognito, and there are some delightful scenes before the film begins to move downhill. Let it suffice to say/write that once the setting moves from the US to Denmark there are few surprises. The romance loses its luster (for me, not them). The impediments to the romance are so predictable. There is no pizzazz, energy, flair. This is a stale tale, and even a terrific cast cannot improve it much.I am surprised at my lukewarm response to ""The Prince And Me."" I love princess flicks. Julia Stiles is a favorite, and she doesn't disappoint here. The problem is what she is given to work with lacks freshness and originality. The screenwriting is merely average. I mean, were any cliches ommited from the script? Ms. Stiles does brighten the screen, as do many in the cast - Prince Eddy is a real winner, and so is Soren (Ben Miller), the prince's valet. But there is just no zing!

The movie takes its time telling the story in order to develop the characters in a good way (it was never boring in my opinion).  It is a five star movie until we get to the end and I will admit I am probably just getting too old and practical but the ending really left a foul taste in my mouth.  I expected fantasy, it is a fairy tale kind of story, but that is not the ending you get, we get the spreading of the myth that you can have it all.  Spoiler alert in case you want to see it:  I am sick of the false belief that you can have it all.  No, you really can't.  Life is about choices and you have to make them; when you do you have to give up something to get your goal.  If a nanny is raising you kids while you work 80 hours a week and go out on the weekends you don't have it all-you have your work and social life and on the side you spawned children to be raised by someone else.  If you stay at home to raise your children then great, you are a houseparent but you are giving up your career (at least for 18 yeas or so).  If you want to go to medical school, go do that but you can't be a queen and a doctor, and a mom and a whatever.  Make your choices and live with them but to say the handsome prince is going to wait 7-12 years while she does medical school and residency and then her mission work adds another few years . . . just plain silly.

You could truly believe that he went from playboy to devoted prince charming through the course of the movie.Julia Stiles, well, what can I say?  Really, her most perfect performance yet (although rivaled by her performance in Mona Lisa.)  I really believed she was a hard-working dairy farm girl and a brilliant scientist working hard to become a doctor.  How many actors could pull off that dual-personality?Not to be missed, her solo dancing scene.  It was truly beautiful.  The song was perfect, and her imperfect yet unself-conscious movement really sealed the deal with her prince charming.The role of Soren was diverse and funny, yet a bit mean.  In the end, I didn't really like him.The only really plot problem came when Paige (Julia Stiles) had to tell Eddie (Luke Mably) about her desire not to give up her dreams.  Her good-bye was abrupt with very little segue.Although we knew she had worthwhile dreams of becoming a doctor, there just wasn't enough warning this scene was coming.  I felt a bit betrayed by the script as I believed very much in her dedicated love to the prince at this point.  Had there been a scene or two where she seemed to miss her former dreams, I would have been a little less suprised when this scene came about.Here good-bye seemed a bit heartless as she did not even open up a dialog to discuss it with Eddie.  As I said, the good-bye was really abrupt and out-of-character with the degree of their love.  (I guess I hoped for the impossible, as many movie-watchers would, that she could find a way of pursuing her dreams while fulfilling her role as a queen too.)Though the ending was ambiguous, it gave us hope that they might one day forge a way to be together -- and ""live happily everafter, the end.""",5,A little gem!,1100736000,"11 18, 2004",2004,2134,"['are', 'many', 'well-written', 'reviews', 'movie', 'will', 'only', 'add', 'few', 'more', 'points.I', 'felt', 'acting', 'Luke', 'Mably', 'was', 'superb', 'could', 'move', 'easly', 'carefree', 'playboy', 'soul-touched', 'romeo', 'be', 'believable', 'emotion', 'was', 'revealed', 'eyes', 'face', 'instances', 'where', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'hiding', 'emotions', 'really', 'admired', 'performance', 'could', 'truly', 'believe', 'went', 'playboy', 'devoted', 'prince', 'charming', 'course', 'movie.Julia', 'Stiles', 'well', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'Really', 'most', 'perfect', 'performance', 'yet', 'rivaled', 'performance', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'really', 'believed', 'was', 'hard-working', 'dairy', 'farm', 'girl', 'brilliant', 'scientist', 'working', 'hard', 'become', 'doctor', 'How', 'many', 'actors', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'dual-personality', 'Not', 'be', 'missed', 'solo', 'dancing', 'scene', 'was', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'song', 'was', 'perfect', 'imperfect', 'yet', 'unself-conscious', 'movement', 'really', 'sealed', 'deal', 'prince', 'charming.The', 'role', 'Soren', 'was', 'diverse', 'funny', 'yet', 'bit', 'mean', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'him.The', 'only', 'really', 'plot', 'problem', 'came', 'when', 'Paige', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'had', 'tell', 'Eddie', 'Luke', 'Mably', 'desire', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'dreams', 'good-bye', 'was', 'abrupt', 'very', 'little', 'knew', 'had', 'worthwhile', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'doctor', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'warning', 'scene', 'was', 'coming', 'felt', 'bit', 'betrayed', 'script', 'believed', 'very', 'much', 'dedicated', 'love', 'prince', 'point', 'Had', 'been', 'scene', 'two', 'where', 'seemed', 'miss', 'former', 'dreams', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'less', 'suprised', 'when', 'scene', 'came', 'about.Here', 'good-bye', 'seemed', 'bit', 'heartless', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'open', 'up', 'dialog', 'discuss', 'Eddie', 'said', 'good-bye', 'was', 'really', 'abrupt', 'out-of-character', 'degree', 'love', 'guess', 'hoped', 'impossible', 'many', 'movie-watchers', 'would', 'could', 'find', 'way', 'pursuing', 'dreams', 'fulfilling', 'role', 'queen', 'too', 'ending', 'was', 'ambiguous', 'gave', 'hope', 'might', 'one', 'day', 'forge', 'way', 'be', 'together', 'live', 'happily', 'everafter', 'end']",N/A

Talha ""Weird Gurl""","[4, 4]","Despite the efforts to describe this story as a great story that has not been done before, the reality is far different from that suggested by the producers of the film. This is little more than yet another variation on the Cinderella story that Hollywood has been milking for one hundred years. Some of those milkings have been somewhat more successful than the others, but overall it is a theme that we have all become rather too familiar with over the years in film. It also does not help that it has been paraded in some form or another in real life over recent decades too. So what exactly does The Prince & Me offer that makes it stand out in a crowd?Basically not a whole lot. My attraction to the film was simply due to the casting of Julia Stiles in the lead role - of the emerging crop of new female actors, she is in my view one of the better ones and she rarely offers up a poor performance. The trouble is that whilst she might not offer up poor performances, sometimes her co-workers are not so discriminating and at times let her down. This is perhaps one of those times. As for other attractions the film might have? Not too many.Yet despite all the less than positive vibes here, what results is a decent enough romantic comedy that is by no means an atrocious way to spend two hours of your life. There are certainly a lot better choices out there, but equally there are loads of even worse choices.

828288,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00029NLGO,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 3]","On one of the bonus features for ""The Prince and Me"" the producer for the film talks about how nobody had ever made a film about a prince who comes to the United States to fall in love with a commoner.  I guess ""Coming to America"" does not count because the prince was looking for a bride over here, unless there is some reason Eddie Murphy's character does not count as a real (read ""European"") prince.  That seems a strange justification for recycling this particular story on a par with saying a war movie would be something new because it takes place in Wisconsin and no war movie has ever been set in Wisconsin.  I pick the Cheese state because ""The Prince and Me,"" like ""Love Actualy,"" thinks that the sexiest women in America are in Wisconsin.  I have to salute whoever is in charge of getting the state good publicity in the movies.The prince in this case is Edvard Valdemar Dangaard (Luke Mably), who is too busy enjoying the good life and all the women who cling to him everyone he goes to spend much time dealing with the fact he is the heir to the throne of Denmark.  He is apparently so shallow that a tape of ""Girls Gone Wild"" focusing on college coeds in Wisconsin is enough to make him fly off to the U.S.A. to enroll at a college and get a dorm room that he can share with a roommate and still have room for his faithful servant Soren (Ben Miller).  Meanwhile, Paige Morgan (Julia Stiles), a hard working pre-med student who is determined to get into Johns Hopkins and is apparently the last unengaged girl in her farm town back home in dairy country.Once Eddie, as the prince know wants to be called, shows up on campus Paige is the woman that he is constantly running into, culminating with their faithful coupling as lab partners in a science course.  This does not bode well for her grade in that course given Eddie's inability to show up on time for class, but eventually he starts to hold his own.  Besides, Paige the science wiz is having trouble with her Shakespeare course (an ironic idea given the fact Stiles has done update versions of ""The Taming of the Shrew"" and ""Othello"") and Eddie likes to quote from the Bard as a way for making up for an apparently inability to come up with anything bright to say on his own.These two are going to hate each other and then they are going to fall in love.  Then she is going to find out who he really is and that is going to cause problems for a while.  He is going to visit her farm and she is going to visit his castle.  His parents are going to have something to say about her.  She is going to have to decide between career and family.  It is so hard for this sort of plot line to get away from all of the Cinderella cliches that it is easy to lose sight of some of the more interesting twists in this particular version of the tale and the fact that there are some charming moments.  In terms of the later I will point to what may be the most romantic way of offering a girl a ring that I can have ever seen.Unfortunately when ""The Prince and Me"" gets to the most interesting part, which deals with what sort of queen is needed in a country like Denmark in the 21st century, the movie is about over.  I understand that this movie is targeted at teenage girls who want to believe in the fantasy that they can find their own Prince Charming, even if he is not the heir to a real European throne, and that such an audience is not interested in the material practice of the contemporary monarchy.  But one of the things I liked about this movie was the idea that Paige forces Eddie to grow up so that he is actually interested in being a good monarch and helping his country.  This is a good thing, because his ailing father (Edward Fox) has to abdicate his crown just as a strike is about to cripple the country.Besides, this issue is a concern of Eddie's mother (Miranda Richardson), who has to revise her initial opinion about Paige.  But the happy ever after here has to do with the romance and not the state of Denmark and I actually give this film points for not having a big wedding as the obvious grand finale.  The chief attraction is Stiles, who cannot help but communicate intelligence as an actress.  Fortunately the script does not force her to do any of the dumb things that often happen to such characters; that all happens to her prince.  This is much more her film than his, and it is believable that she has a conflict of the head and the heart at the end.

828289,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00029NLGO,Lawyeraau,"[1, 1]","With its excellent cast and Cinderella storyline, this is a fairly formulaic, predictable film about a very focused young woman, Paige Morgan (Julia Stiles), a farmer's daughter from Wisconsin who wants to become a doctor. She is so focused that she simply does not date, that is, until she is a pre-med student at the University of Wisconsin and meets ""Eddie"" (Luke Mably), a fellow student at the University. Despite an inauspicious first meeting, she and ""Eddie"" become lab partners, work in the same student hang-out joint, and eventually fall in love. Little does she know that ""Eddie"" is really Edvard, the Crown Prince of Denmark.It seems that Edvard, nothing more than a rich, spoiled royal playboy, originally set out to attend the University of Wisconsin incognito, accompanied by his valet, Soren (Ben Miller), in hopes of sowing some wild oats and scoring with the chicks. When he meets Julia, his hopes of an easy, breezy fling are dashed, when he discovers that his charms are initially lost upon her. They eventually become friends, as they each have something that they can teach the other, but end up falling in love. Just as they are on the bring of consummating their love, the paparazzi descend upon them, and all hell breaks loose.Paige is, of course, understandably miffed that ""Eddie"" has not told her the truth. Edvard, however, makes Paige an honorable proposal of marriage. Needless to say, the royal family is initially less than thrilled with the Crown Prince's choice of a mate. While King Haraald (James Fox) feels that it is his son's choice, Queen Rosalind (Miranda Richardson) is not a happy camper at the prospect of an American commoner for a daughter-in-law. Of course, Paige doesn't help any, as on the surface she comes across as a stolid, unsophisticated, and uncultured, though otherwise nice, young woman. Still, it seems that Edvard has done a three hundred and sixty degree turn and become a serious and stable young man since his attachment to Paige developed. Then, Paige has second thoughts about becoming the next Queen of Denmark, throwing a small monkey wrench into the works.James Fox and Miranda Richardson steal the movie out from under Julia Stiles' nose, however brief their appearance. Moreover, there is simply little chemistry between Ms. Stiles and her leading man, Luke Mably. While I think that Ms. Stiles is one of the better young actresses around, this film is simply not one of her finer performances, as her portrayal of Paige is often leaden. It could simply be that she was hampered by the quality of the script. As for Luke Mably, he had his moments, but they were not enough to make this film more than what it is. This is simply a pleasant, romantic piece of fluff that is worth a rental and not much more.",3,THE FARMER'S DAUGHTER MEETS THE CROWN PRINCE OF DENMARK...,1150588800,"06 18, 2006",2006,2776,"['excellent', 'cast', 'Cinderella', 'storyline', 'fairly', 'formulaic', 'predictable', 'film', 'very', 'focused', 'young', 'woman', 'Paige', 'Morgan', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'farmer', 'daughter', 'Wisconsin', 'who', 'become', 'doctor', 'so', 'focused', 'simply', 'not', 'date', 'pre-med', 'student', 'University', 'Wisconsin', 'Eddie', 'Luke', 'Mably', 'fellow', 'student', 'University', 'inauspicious', 'first', 'meeting', 'Eddie', 'become', 'lab', 'partners', 'work', 'same', 'student', 'hang-out', 'joint', 'eventually', 'fall', 'love', 'Little', 'know', 'Eddie', 'really', 'Edvard', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Denmark.It', 'Edvard', 'nothing', 'more', 'rich', 'spoiled', 'royal', 'playboy', 'originally', 'set', 'out', 'attend', 'University', 'Wisconsin', 'incognito', 'accompanied', 'valet', 'Soren', 'Ben', 'Miller', 'hopes', 'sowing', 'wild', 'oats', 'scoring', 'chicks', 'When', 'Julia', 'hopes', 'easy', 'breezy', 'fling', 'are', 'dashed', 'when', 'charms', 'are', 'initially', 'lost', 'eventually', 'become', 'friends', 'have', 'something', 'can', 'teach', 'other', 'end', 'up', 'falling', 'love', 'Just', 'are', 'bring', 'consummating', 'love', 'paparazzi', 'descend', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose.Paige', 'course', 'understandably', 'miffed', 'Eddie', 'not', 'told', 'truth', 'Edvard', 'however', 'Paige', 'honorable', 'proposal', 'marriage', 'Needless', 'say', 'royal', 'family', 'initially', 'less', 'thrilled', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'choice', 'mate', 'King', 'Haraald', 'James', 'Fox', 'son', 'choice', 'Queen', 'Rosalind', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'not', 'happy', 'camper', 'prospect', 'American', 'commoner', 'daughter-in-law', 'course', 'Paige', ""n't"", 'help', 'surface', 'across', 'stolid', 'unsophisticated', 'uncultured', 'otherwise', 'nice', 'young', 'woman', 'Still', 'Edvard', 'done', 'three', 'hundred', 'sixty', 'degree', 'turn', 'become', 'serious', 'stable', 'young', 'man', 'attachment', 'Paige', 'developed', 'Then', 'Paige', 'second', 'thoughts', 'becoming', 'next', 'Queen', 'Denmark', 'throwing', 'small', 'monkey', 'wrench', 'works.James', 'Fox', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'steal', 'movie', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'nose', 'however', 'brief', 'appearance', 'Moreover', 'simply', 'little', 'chemistry', 'Ms.', 'Stiles', 'leading', 'man', 'Luke', 'Mably', 'think', 'Ms.', 'Stiles', 'one', 'better', 'young', 'actresses', 'film', 'simply', 'not', 'one', 'finer', 'performances', 'portrayal', 'Paige', 'often', 'leaden', 'could', 'simply', 'be', 'was', 'hampered', 'quality', 'script', 'Luke', 'Mably', 'had', 'moments', 'were', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'what', 'simply', 'pleasant', 'romantic', 'piece', 'fluff', 'rental', 'not', 'much', 'more']",N/A

I mention it because I may be mistaken this was the hero) was racing some brat pack he runs with on a wager, it is to be supposed.  This might have been interesting, but the camera cut back and forth between these two races for an inexcusably long time, while introductory credits were running overwritten.

As a romantic comedy it is just average and includes several cliches that drive me crazy in this genre.There are MANY romantic comedies where one character has a secret they hide from their love interest.  In ""Prince and Me"" the secret is that ""Eddie"", the Danish student who shows up one day at the University of Wisconsin (played convincingly by Luke Mably) is actually the Prince and soon to be King of Denmark.  (It is extremly convenient for us that all the Danes in the film including the royal family, prime minister, servants and paparazzi all speak English exclusively!)  Our heroine, a farm-girl pre-med student, is played by Julia Stiles, and Ms. Stiles continues a budding acting career where she plays women of depth and character.  Her Paige Morgan is accepted to Johns Hopkins Medical School around the same time she discovers Eddie is a Prince, and she aspires to work as a Doctor in an underserved country.Prince Edvard GOES to Wisconsin because he's one of those Euro-trashy princes in the beginning of the movie and he sees an ad for one of those videos where college girls pull their shirts up, and *these* girls happen to be from Wisconsin.  Bent on meeting sleazy young girls at the U of W Edvard immediately becomes fixated on the least sleazy, most-principaled woman in sight.When the scene comes where Paige discovers Eddie is the Crown Prince she doesn't think ""hey.... the hunky guy I was just kissing in the library is actually a PRINCE!"" Instead she shrieks at him ""you lied to me!"" (which is only true for those who consider that a lie can include what you don't say - Eddie only tells Paige that he has to ""go into the family business"" when he returns to Denmark.)The King is ill at this exact moment and Edvard must jet back to Copenhagen, which leads to one of the better done Romantic Comedy cliche-moments, the one where one character flies off after the lovers have had a tiff, only to have the other character come flying after them on the next plane.  (If you think I've given anything away here, you haven't seen many Romantic Comedies.)The third act begins here as Paige arrives in Denmark, is reunited with Edvard, and begins to contemplate a possible life as Queen of Denmark.  During the breakfast where it first dawns on her that this is possible she suddenly looks uncertain.  ""Do you think the people will mind if I'm the Queen of Denmark and all I've seen is the airport?""The Cinderella tale gets a thoroughly modern and believable upgrade, and it must have been difficult for Martha Coolidge and the screenwriters to generate the required romantic conflict for the characters who seem to have everything.  Paige is not only the girl getting to go to Johns Hopkins, but the Prince falls in love with her too?  There's conflict here?Okay - it's not the best Romantic Comedy ever.

The story is a fairy tale, to be sure, but if we are to believe the script of this movie, Denmark is about to have a flakey, uneducated, lazy jerk ascend to the throne.  There is growth in the prince's character, but it's not done in a believeable manner.  The prince is a disinterested punk who spends state meetings drawing cars on his agenda, yet after one semester in Wisconsin, he is able to negotiate settlements to stop strikes.  Perhaps I took the movie too seriously, but if I were from Denmark, I would find this depiction of my country and people insulting.  I'm not certain that the people of Wisconsin could have been too thrilled either.  All in all, even for what it's supposed to be (a fairy tale story aimed at 13 year old girls), the story is simply too cliche, which is disappointing considering it has some wonderful people in the cast.

Which would have been nice.This film was fairly good, although it seemed to drag a bit in parts. Julia Stiles was fabulous as always, looking older with her shorter, dark hair, trying (unsuccessfully) to move away from the teen romance which she's made her name doing. I felt there were several continuity problems regarding her hair - one minute it's completely dark, then it seems to go very light brown, then back to dark brown, complete with blonde highlights.As usual, it's a predictable rom-com, with an unexpected ending. I wasn't expecting what happened at the end to happen. And when Paige went to Denmark - did she not miss out on a lot of college work?! And also there's no apparent time line in the movie. Thanksgiving is mentioned, as are finals, but when Paige goes to Denmark, surely there should be some snow on the ground, as it happens practically right after Thanksgiving!This is basically a film for all those little girls out there, who haven't really fallen in love yet, and think there's a guy out there who will sweep them off their feet, and he just happens to be rich! Just wait until they grow up a bit (sorry), and the likelihood of this happening is very rare. Instead, you'll probably meet the &quot;love of your life&quot; in a bar, and after sleeping with him, never see him again.The scene I loved was just before the press discovered the prince and the pauper kissing. Julia & Luke Mably are sitting in the library, holding hands, and stroking each other's fingers - that kinda stuff makes me go weak at the knees. No wonder she pounced on him.This is a good movie if you like these rom-coms. If you're a guy, there's probably a big chance you'll sit and moan right the way through.

828325,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00029NLGO,Only-A-Child,"[1, 2]","Roger Ebert actually gave ""The Prince and Me"" zero stars which seems a little harsh, as it does have a few universally enjoyable scenes and decent performances from almost the entire cast. Unfortunately they are saddled with a somewhat weak and completely predictable screenplay, and a premise that has been used and reused.Ebert compares it unfavorably with ""Win a Date With Tad Hamilton"" where the same type of small town girl wins a date with a big Hollywood star, who then falls in love with her freshness and sincerity.  She begins to struggle with the tedious real-life demands of what she thought would be a glamorous life. Others compare it to 1954's ""The Student Prince"" and its 1997 television remake, although not unfavorably as both productions are considered barely competent. I think it is most like ""Coming to America"", although it does not capture the humor and social commentary of that film. I'm sure that the producers of ""The Prince and Me"" drew considerable inspiration from the box office popularity of ""Coming to America. Unfortunately they failed to follow its example and create a fictional monarchy, choosing instead to subject Denmark to the indignity of this silly story.The story obviously satisfies some basic yearning in the human psyche, or at least the teenage female psyche. The most interesting thing about ""The Prince and Me"" is the inspired way they successfully expanded their target audience to include pre-teen girls. By casting Eliza Bennett (with apologies to Jane Austen) as the Princes's adoring little sister, Princess Arabella, they created a nice fantasy for this younger demographic. To her credit, Eliza brings a lot of much needed charm to the production.The physical casting of the two leads is very good. Julia Stiles does not exude a lot of sensuality but fits the role of a brainy American college student, with ambitions to become a doctor. That Stiles is convincing as a smart and serious young woman helps convince us when Queen (Miranda Richardson) is eventually won over by her prospective daughter-in- law. Their changing relationship is the one plot element that you don't entirely see coming. And Luke Mably fits Americas idea of a young prince, looking much like those Windsor boys.While the pairings of Prince and little sister and of Queen and future Queen work exceptionally well, the Stiles-Mably relationship has no chemistry and seems terribly forced. So one just has to go with it and enjoy the other elements of the film.Once the story moves to Copenhagen it gets better as they do a good job of presenting the entire experience from the point of view of Paige Morgan (Stiles).

In fact, she never dates, preferring to keep her mind on her pre-med college studies: she's worked hard for everything she's got!  Prince Edvard ""Eddie"" of Denmark (Luke Mably) has the opposite problem: he has grown up surrounded by wealth and privilege (having been groomed since birth to become the next ruler of his country).  Only thing is: he's not ready for the responsibility!Along with his trusty servant/bodyguard Soren (Ben Miller), the Prince enrolls as a student at a Wisconsin college, in order to meet girls; he immediately sets off to the local hangout to find some.  It is there that he runs into Paige, who is working; she dislikes him from the start, as he acts as less than a gentleman to her. When Eddie comes along the next day and pairs up with her as her lab partner, she's not about to change her mind about him...after all, he's just a rich playboy.  Isn't he?Although Eddie quickly realizes that she is the girl for him: the ONLY girl for him.  He apologizes for his earlier behavior and the two become friends, and then something more.  But when Paige discovers that her Eddie is actually Prince Edvard Valdemar Dangaard, soon to be 51st ruler of Denmark, she is understandably upset that he lied to her...but will she forgive him?  And if she does, will the Prince be able to convince his parents to accept a poor Wisconsin girl as the future queen of Denmark?Running from the paparazzi, exploding lab chemicals, lawnmower races, and a royal procession, this movie is full of cute moments of excitement and fun!  For those of you with kids that are worried about content, there is barely any language in the film (one ""bloody"" and one ""I'm going to kick your a**""), and other than a few scenes in a bar hangout and some make-out scenses, it is very family friendly!From the beautiful scenery and dream-like sequence of events (that come across VERY realistically), this romantic film is definitely worth the watch!  The chemistry and love that blossoms between Paige and Eddie is so sweet and believable that you can't help falling in love with the characters themselves, and wishing that every girl could end up with their Prince Charming and live happily ever after!",4,A cute and believable love story!,1080777600,"04 1, 2004",2004,2377,"['saw', 'cute', 'film', 'weekend', 'opening', 'local', 'sneak', 'preview', 'let', 'say', 'was', 'great', 'Wisconsin-born', 'Paige', 'Morgan', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'boys', 'are', 'distraction', 'fact', 'never', 'preferring', 'keep', 'mind', 'pre-med', 'college', 'studies', 'worked', 'hard', 'everything', 'got', 'Prince', 'Edvard', 'Eddie', 'Denmark', 'Luke', 'Mably', 'opposite', 'problem', 'grown', 'up', 'surrounded', 'wealth', 'privilege', 'having', 'been', 'groomed', 'birth', 'become', 'next', 'ruler', 'country', 'Only', 'thing', 'not', 'ready', 'responsibility', 'trusty', 'servant/bodyguard', 'Soren', 'Ben', 'Miller', 'Prince', 'enrolls', 'student', 'Wisconsin', 'college', 'order', 'meet', 'girls', 'immediately', 'local', 'hangout', 'find', 'there', 'Paige', 'who', 'working', 'start', 'less', 'gentleman', 'When', 'Eddie', 'next', 'day', 'pairs', 'up', 'lab', 'partner', 'not', 'change', 'mind', 'just', 'rich', 'playboy', ""n't"", 'Eddie', 'quickly', 'girl', 'ONLY', 'girl', 'earlier', 'behavior', 'two', 'become', 'friends', 'then', 'something', 'more', 'when', 'Paige', 'Eddie', 'actually', 'Prince', 'Edvard', 'Valdemar', 'Dangaard', 'soon', 'be', '51st', 'ruler', 'Denmark', 'understandably', 'upset', 'lied', 'will', 'forgive', 'will', 'Prince', 'be', 'able', 'convince', 'parents', 'accept', 'poor', 'Wisconsin', 'girl', 'future', 'queen', 'Denmark', 'Running', 'paparazzi', 'exploding', 'lab', 'chemicals', 'lawnmower', 'races', 'royal', 'procession', 'movie', 'full', 'cute', 'moments', 'excitement', 'fun', 'kids', 'are', 'worried', 'content', 'barely', 'language', 'film', 'one', 'bloody', 'one', ""'m"", 'going', 'kick', 'a**', 'other', 'few', 'scenes', 'bar', 'hangout', 'make-out', 'scenses', 'very', 'family', 'friendly', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'dream-like', 'sequence', 'events', 'come', 'VERY', 'realistically', 'romantic', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watch', 'chemistry', 'love', 'blossoms', 'Paige', 'Eddie', 'so', 'sweet', 'believable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'falling', 'love', 'characters', 'wishing', 'girl', 'could', 'end', 'up', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'live', 'happily', 'ever']",N/A

He's a royal slacker who has come to the University of Wisconsin in the naively boorish belief that coeds in the States will be willing to lift up their shirts for him the moment he asks them to do so.  And all I can say is if you can swallow that premise, then you can pretty much swallow everything else that comes along in the wake of it.Not pretty in a conventional sense, the gifted Stiles has a full-moon face and a wincey expression that gives her an air of intelligence that seems sorely out of place in the mind-numbingly preposterous scenario she`s been called upon to enact here.  Luke Mably is bland and flavorless as her knight in shining armor, and the whole production is so sloppy in its details that, even though it is supposed to be Thanksgiving in Wisconsin, everyone is running around in shirtsleeves and shorts among the trees that seem to have forgotten to turn colors and shed their leaves for the season.

Being a Crown Prince is really not a very good job which this film shows.  You are surrounded by sycophants and can never determine who are real friends and who are not.  Thus the Prince goes incognito to Wisconsin and the fun begins.  Be sure and watch his Valet because he has some of the best lines in the movie.  The Prince is totally helpless in most situations but not all.  More importantly he is willing to learn and just be a regular guy.  His driven and soon to be girl friend is also relatively realistic in her disdain for the pampered Prince.  Once his cover is blown the action shifts back to Denmark and the royal family.  I felt the Queen came across like most of the Danes I have met -- a little stiff at first but warm, friendly, and essentially pro-American.

I like Luke Mably's performance as Edward.  With his passing resemblance to younger British royals, he's easy on the eye, and the viewer does get a sense that he matures from being the doofish, selfish, rover-boy he is in the beginning, into someone who's actually capable of ruling a country.  But I'm not too keen on Julia Stiles's performance.  Her face and manner are curiously stiff, even when she's upset and crying.  As the compelling reason for the Prince's growing up, she brings all the intelligent, sensible, no-nonsense strength to her character that's required, but the ""swept away by her feelings"" half of her performance that should be there too, is lacking.  I like her best when she's learning to know Edward while they're at college - particularly, the Shakespeare scene in the laundry room.  But I have to talk myself into believing that (SPOILER ALERT) she's so in love with Edward that she runs away from her life in the U.S. to be with him.  Perhaps because she's been SO unbending until that point, she doesn't entirely project the softer, lovable and loving side of her character in equal parts.  (END SPOILER)The best sections of the movie are when the characters are slowly learning about each other, talking to each other and reacting to different situations.  The story is easy to enjoy as a fairytale, but the screenwriter also captured some realistic relationship cues, which give it some depth.

828355,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00029NLGO,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 7]","'The Prince and Me' features charming Julia Stiles as American college student Paige, who is determined to make it in the academic field.  There, from Denmark, comes Prince Edvard (played by British Luke Mably) as 'Eddie' seeking for lots of fun and chicks here in Wisconsin, just because he saw these cute American girls on TV.  What happens in the 1h50m film is nothing surprisng, except that the real Prince of Denmark, Crown Prince Frederick married a commoner Mary Donaldson of Australia the same year this film was released.The film is a typical fairy tale like 'The Princess Diaries,' but considering that fact above mentioned, it should have more topicality and credibility in it.  Adults watching it, however, will find the film's story nothing new, keeping itself in the quite safe territory.  The story is made out of strict formulas -- including comic relief Ben Miller appearing as Eddie's valet -- and the love story between Paige and Eddie develops exactly as you expect.  They hate each other at first, then come to realize that the girl/boy is not as bad as he/she had been thinking.Still, the actors are so amiable that they almost get away with the cliched script and Martha Coolige's by-the-numbers play-it-safe direction.  In fact, 'The Prince and Me' proves unwittingly that Julia Stiles is such a fine, talented actress who needs and deserves much better films, romantic comedy or not.  Her natural charms exude so easily in the too familiar situations that she can give credibility even to the most contrived spript.Veterans also appear.  Miranda Richardson and James Fox as The Queen and The King of Denmark, and they are as great as you can imagine.  If only the film decided to include their turns more, and shows something interactive between them and Julia Stiles.  As it is, their roles are obligatory at best, though still they render the film's images of royal family more credible ... just briefly though.Escapism, Cinderella story, whatever you say, 'The Prince and Me' has some funny scenes and plausible moments concerning the royal family in it.  And after all, the leads are so likable that it is hard to hate this film.  Still, it could be better, I think, with shorter running time and tight direction.  And if I say that the ending is very weak -- it could be and should be more romantic -- the most devoted fans would agree with me.",3,"Fluffy Fairy Tale, But Amiable Julia Stitles Still Shines",1103414400,"12 19, 2004",2004,2374,"['Prince', 'Me', 'features', 'charming', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'American', 'college', 'student', 'Paige', 'who', 'determined', 'make', 'academic', 'field', 'Denmark', 'Prince', 'Edvard', 'played', 'British', 'Luke', 'Mably', ""'Eddie"", 'seeking', 'lots', 'fun', 'chicks', 'here', 'Wisconsin', 'just', 'saw', 'cute', 'American', 'girls', 'TV', 'What', '1h50m', 'film', 'nothing', 'surprisng', 'real', 'Prince', 'Denmark', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'Frederick', 'married', 'commoner', 'Mary', 'Donaldson', 'Australia', 'same', 'year', 'film', 'was', 'released.The', 'film', 'typical', 'fairy', 'tale', ""'The"", 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'considering', 'fact', 'mentioned', 'should', 'have', 'more', 'topicality', 'credibility', 'Adults', 'watching', 'however', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'story', 'nothing', 'new', 'keeping', 'quite', 'safe', 'territory', 'story', 'made', 'strict', 'formulas', 'including', 'comic', 'relief', 'Ben', 'Miller', 'appearing', 'Eddie', 'valet', 'love', 'story', 'Paige', 'Eddie', 'exactly', 'expect', 'hate', 'other', 'first', 'then', 'come', 'realize', 'girl/boy', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'he/she', 'had', 'been', 'thinking.Still', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'amiable', 'almost', 'get', 'away', 'cliched', 'script', 'Martha', 'Coolige', 'by-the-numbers', 'play-it-safe', 'direction', 'fact', 'Prince', 'Me', 'proves', 'unwittingly', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'such', 'fine', 'talented', 'actress', 'who', 'much', 'better', 'films', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'not', 'natural', 'charms', 'exude', 'so', 'easily', 'too', 'familiar', 'situations', 'can', 'give', 'credibility', 'even', 'most', 'contrived', 'spript.Veterans', 'also', 'appear', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'James', 'Fox', 'Queen', 'King', 'Denmark', 'are', 'as', 'great', 'can', 'imagine', 'only', 'film', 'decided', 'include', 'turns', 'more', 'something', 'interactive', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'roles', 'are', 'obligatory', 'best', 'still', 'render', 'film', 'images', 'royal', 'family', 'more', 'credible', 'just', 'briefly', 'though.Escapism', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'say', ""'The"", 'Prince', 'Me', 'funny', 'scenes', 'plausible', 'moments', 'concerning', 'royal', 'family', 'leads', 'are', 'so', 'likable', 'hard', 'hate', 'film', 'Still', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'think', 'shorter', 'running', 'time', 'tight', 'direction', 'say', 'ending', 'very', 'weak', 'could', 'be', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'romantic', 'most', 'devoted', 'fans', 'would', 'agree']",N/A

People might grow to be jaded or even cynical but I refuse to believe that there are people out their who didn't love fairytales even as just a quick phase during childhood. In this world where the fantasy of meeting Prince Charming is being held in derision in the quest for empowerment, it's nice to see that there are ways to encourage girls to accomplish goals, be strong, and still let themselves be open to love and supporting a partner in their own goals and dreams too.Life is meant to be shared, and maybe not for everyone in a romantic context, but with family and friends. This film is great because when we first meet Paige Morgan, she's shutting everything out. Forget romance, she can't talk about ANYTHING but her ambition to her best friends and family. Her tunnel-vision handicaps her career ambitions as well, because it's wrecking her humanities grades. See it's not just about the romance here. In order to truly succeed, we all need to be open to the world and people around us. That's the real message of this movie, and it's a good one for boys and girls. Being wrapped up in yourself brings failure.This is something Prince Edward and Paige learn by opening up first to one-another, and then to their own destinies. They make each other better people, which is why for all it's corniness and fantasy the relationship works. Again, it's not the fact that they fall in love that makes their relationship special, it's the fact that they bring out the best in each other, and everyone needs people like that in their lives in any capacity.But enough moralizing. This movie's just buckets full of sap, wit, and romance, and I just eat it up!I've been a fan of Ms. Styles for years, and to see this accomplished Shakespearean Actress, and ballerina, play a Bard hating, graceless, science geek was just awesome. She is so genuine, so unabashedly full of sincerity and conviction that I beg you to ignore all of the sequels in this series! Without her playing Paige, they're just not worth it!Luke Malby... (sigh) LOL I mean: he's cute, he's got the accent, he's talented, really how can a girl not sigh? I should be getting too old for such things but I can't help it. There's just something so endearing about how he plays Edward that even at his height of Jackassery, (""this isn't my first indiscretion"")you never forget that there is a good heart underneath all that spoilt self-doubt.  It's not easy playing royalty, one has to cultivate an almost indescribable aura, and he's got it! Whether it's a gift of nature or his own hard work, he managed to convince the staff of an upscale restaurant that he was an actual prince during off hours! This innate aura is yet another reason why I couldn't sit throughThe Prince & Me 2because in that film, he was the ONLY person with the aura! I always say that what makes an actor do well in a role is their sincerity, and their conviction. In this installment Mr. Malby had it in spades, in part two, not-so-much, but I can't blame him.Miranda Richardson, as the Queen of Denmark has great impact for such a small role. She also has the illusive royal aura about her and I personally loved the fact that the costume designer went really BIG with the wardrobe and added a touch of whimsy to echo the style of Her Majesty Queen Margrethe of Denmark. Granted, this film is most certainly NOT about the Danish Royal Family, (even though Crown Prince Fredrick did indeed marry a ""commoner"") but it's still a nice touch.Truthfully speaking though, one secondary character did steal the show and that was long-suffering Soren, played by Ben Miller. We all know that sometimes being the ""Straight Man"" in a comedy is a thankless job. Not here, Mr. Miller endows Soren with a biting wit from his very first line. You feel sympathy for him because he has to constantly follow Edward around, cleaning up his messes both literally and metaphorically. Yet, you also are touched by his loyalty and his affection for his wayward charge. Even at the peak of frustration, Soren never gives up on Edward or forgets the good in him. And, when real life gets slightly confusing for the lad, he's always there to translate and nudge in the right direction. Again this is where I say avoid the sequels. I ADORE Jonathan Firth! He played a dang fine Prince Albert inVictoria & Albertbut nobody can play Soren as well as Mr. Miller.Now here's where I get shallow... Costumes and jewelry OMG. I'm just going to say I want it ALL! Seriously, for a frothy romantic comedy the clothes were heartbreakingly superb! Oh just once I would love to dress up in such lovely things. Jewelry... I saw this movie the first time in the theater when it came out and I literally hyperventilated. My father grew concerned. If their are any fashion students out there, just watch this for the costumes.All in all, I say to anyone who might say they don't love fairytales please try this. Maybe if you look beyond the surface of Princes and Romance you'll discover that at their core, they really just try to teach us to be the best versions of ourselves.",5,"Deep Down, Everyone Loves

The twist here, of course, is that the guy happens to be royalty so there's a fairy tale quality about the end of the film.  The plot is not the major problem here, as it does have a couple of interesting twists.The problem is the execution of the first 30 minutes of the film, which are disjointed and uninteresting.  There is a substantial amount of time spent setting up Paige (Julia Stiles)as independent and driven, and some of the scenes dealing with this topic are forced and repetitive.  The same is true for the Prince (Luke Mably), though his scenes are considerably more interesting due to comic relief provided by Soren (Ben Miller), the prince's man servant.  Overall, the beginning of the film is poorly acted, directed, and written, and frankly was not interesting enough to hold my attention.This is a shame, because after the Prince and Paige fall in love the film picks up, the writing is crisper, and the direction seems to be better.  The subplot with Soren becoming addicted to XBox is absolutely hysterical even though it only consumes a few seconds of screen time.  Once the scene shifts to Denmark the film becomes much more engaging, though the last five minutes, with a cop-out to please the mass market, are disappointing.The DVD has a couple of special features worth watching.  The commentary from director Martha Coolidge (who directed one of my favorite films, Real Genius) is above average and has a nice mix of technical film insider stuff about camera angles and insightful commentary into some of the characters.  There is a featurette about the lawnmower racing sequence (really, the guy's highlight to the film) that is definately worth watching.  The gag reel is average, as are the other featurettes, though it does provide the alternate (read original) ending.Overall, this film gets 0 stars for the first 30 minutes, three stars thereafter, and 4 for the DVD features.  Guys won't like the film unless they're on a date, but they'll at least be able to tolerate it if they can get past the first 30 minutes.",3,Not a bad film after the first 30 minutes,1108857600,"02 20, 2005",2005,2692,"['Disclaimer', 'am', 'not', 'film', 'target', 'audience', 'film', 'was', 'made', '15-30', 'year', 'old', 'women', ""'m"", 'man', 'same', 'age', 'are', 'three', 'kinds', 'chick', 'flicks', 'out', 'there', 'are', 'kind', 'men', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'watching', 'may', 'secretly', 'kind', 'like', 'see', 'Sleepless', 'Seattle', 'kind', 'men', 'could', 'do', 'will', 'tolerate', 'see', 'Ghost', 'kind', 'hate', 'see', 'How', 'Make', 'American', 'Quilt', 'film', 'middle', 'category.The', 'Prince', 'Me', 'what', 'be', 'basic', 'chick', 'flick', 'plot', 'girl', 'independent', 'meets', 'arrogant', 'guy', 'girl', 'changes', 'guy', 'guy', 'changes', 'girl', 'fall', 'love', 'twist', 'here', 'course', 'guy', 'be', 'royalty', 'fairy', 'tale', 'quality', 'end', 'film', 'plot', 'not', 'major', 'problem', 'here', 'have', 'couple', 'interesting', 'twists.The', 'problem', 'execution', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'disjointed', 'uninteresting', 'substantial', 'amount', 'time', 'spent', 'setting', 'up', 'Paige', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'independent', 'driven', 'scenes', 'dealing', 'topic', 'are', 'forced', 'repetitive', 'same', 'true', 'Prince', 'Luke', 'Mably', 'scenes', 'are', 'considerably', 'more', 'interesting', 'due', 'comic', 'relief', 'provided', 'Soren', 'Ben', 'Miller', 'prince', 'man', 'servant', 'Overall', 'beginning', 'film', 'poorly', 'acted', 'directed', 'written', 'frankly', 'was', 'not', 'interesting', 'enough', 'hold', 'attention.This', 'shame', 'Prince', 'Paige', 'fall', 'love', 'film', 'up', 'writing', 'crisper', 'direction', 'be', 'better', 'subplot', 'Soren', 'becoming', 'addicted', 'XBox', 'absolutely', 'hysterical', 'even', 'only', 'few', 'seconds', 'screen', 'time', 'Once', 'scene', 'shifts', 'Denmark', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'engaging', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'cop-out', 'please', 'mass', 'market', 'are', 'disappointing.The', 'DVD', 'couple', 'special', 'features', 'worth', 'watching', 'commentary', 'director', 'Martha', 'Coolidge', 'who', 'directed', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'Real', 'Genius', 'above', 'average', 'nice', 'mix', 'technical', 'film', 'insider', 'stuff', 'camera', 'angles', 'insightful', 'commentary', 'characters', 'featurette', 'lawnmower', 'racing', 'sequence', 'really', 'guy', 'highlight', 'film', 'definately', 'worth', 'watching', 'gag', 'reel', 'average', 'are', 'other', 'featurettes', 'provide', 'alternate', 'read', 'original', 'ending.Overall', 'film', '0', 'stars', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'three', 'stars', 'thereafter', '4', 'DVD', 'features', 'Guys', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', ""'re"", 'date', ""'ll"", 'least', 'be', 'able', 'tolerate', 'can', 'get', 'first', '30', 'minutes']",N/A
