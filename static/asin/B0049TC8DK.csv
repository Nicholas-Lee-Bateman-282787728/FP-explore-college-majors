As I watched the series, I noted that the series seemed to be heading toward a head on crash at the end. You know, where everyone either gets killed or damaged beyond repair in the end. Well, I must say, after taking you thru what looks to be a huge disaster turns out so well, that I really was very impressed with it. I very much suggest buying this series if you like happy endings where not everybody gets tore up before the end.

1390234,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B0049TC8DK,DVD Verdict,"[1, 1]","Judge Roman Martel, DVD Verdict-- The heart of the story is Rin, and the conflict within her. She's just a decent girl who gets pulled into a whole mess. It puts her friends, family and herself in constant danger. And yet, she loves the thrill of driving the Rideback. There are moments when she achieves a unity with the machine, and during these scenes composer Takafumi Wada uses the Mussorsky piece ""The Great Gate of Kiev"" mirroring the moment Rin achieves in the first episode. This little tune pops up in numerous forms tying Rin's love of dancing with her love of the Ridebacks. It works exceedingly well and is darn catchy to boot.By the end of the series things continue getting more dangerous for Rin, no matter how hard she tries to defuse the situations she finds herself in. Once we hit an incident involving her brother, I honestly had no idea where Rideback was going to end up. Tragedy seems to be looming in every corner and Rin's internal conflict shows no sign of resolving.But luckily, this anime series does provide a solid ending with some great closure. It's a refreshing change of pace to have such a good ending in an anime series, and for that reason alone I can easily recommend it.Beyond that, there is plenty to enjoy. The animation by studio Madhouse is up to their high standards. The character design is atypical but works great with the more realistic story line. The characters are well rounded. The action scenes are thrilling. There are some humorous parts (especially in the first quarter), but the drama is what drives the story and it's here where the story excels. Up to the task are the English voice actors who do a great job with their roles, especially Tia Ballard who plays Rin.Funimation presents Rideback with an excellent transfer. Dark scenes looked sharp, and the colors popped during the daytime sequences. The 5.1 sound added a bit of power behind the race and combat scenes. There are two commentary tracks with the English voice actors, both for key episodes in the series. You also get the typical clean opening and ending credits.Rideback does an excellent balancing act that anime often dares but rarely achieves. It mixes genres to create a unique storytelling experience and reaffirms why I love anime as a medium. Simply put, Rideback is one of the best anime series I've seen this year.-Full review at dvdverdict.com",4,The trailer to Rideback didn't do it any justice,1313539200,"08 17, 2011",2011,2378,"['Judge', 'Roman', 'Martel', 'DVD', 'Verdict', 'heart', 'story', 'Rin', 'conflict', 'just', 'decent', 'girl', 'who', 'pulled', 'whole', 'mess', 'friends', 'family', 'constant', 'danger', 'yet', 'thrill', 'driving', 'Rideback', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'unity', 'machine', 'scenes', 'composer', 'Takafumi', 'Wada', 'Mussorsky', 'piece', 'Great', 'Gate', 'Kiev', 'mirroring', 'moment', 'Rin', 'first', 'episode', 'little', 'tune', 'up', 'numerous', 'forms', 'tying', 'Rin', 'love', 'dancing', 'love', 'Ridebacks', 'exceedingly', 'well', 'darn', 'catchy', 'boot.By', 'end', 'series', 'things', 'continue', 'getting', 'more', 'dangerous', 'Rin', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'defuse', 'situations', 'hit', 'incident', 'involving', 'brother', 'honestly', 'had', 'idea', 'where', 'Rideback', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'Tragedy', 'be', 'looming', 'corner', 'Rin', 'internal', 'conflict', 'sign', 'resolving.But', 'luckily', 'anime', 'series', 'provide', 'solid', 'ending', 'great', 'closure', 'refreshing', 'change', 'pace', 'have', 'such', 'good', 'ending', 'anime', 'series', 'reason', 'alone', 'can', 'easily', 'recommend', 'it.Beyond', 'plenty', 'enjoy', 'animation', 'studio', 'Madhouse', 'high', 'standards', 'character', 'design', 'atypical', 'great', 'more', 'realistic', 'story', 'line', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'rounded', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'thrilling', 'are', 'humorous', 'parts', 'especially', 'first', 'quarter', 'drama', 'what', 'story', 'here', 'where', 'story', 'excels', 'task', 'are', 'English', 'voice', 'actors', 'who', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'roles', 'especially', 'Tia', 'Ballard', 'who', 'Rin.Funimation', 'presents', 'Rideback', 'excellent', 'transfer', 'Dark', 'scenes', 'looked', 'sharp', 'colors', 'popped', 'daytime', 'sequences', '5.1', 'sound', 'added', 'bit', 'power', 'race', 'combat', 'scenes', 'are', 'two', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'English', 'voice', 'actors', 'key', 'episodes', 'series', 'also', 'get', 'typical', 'clean', 'opening', 'ending', 'credits.Rideback', 'excellent', 'balancing', 'act', 'anime', 'often', 'rarely', 'mixes', 'genres', 'create', 'unique', 'storytelling', 'experience', 'why', 'love', 'anime', 'medium', 'Simply', 'put', 'Rideback', 'one', 'best', 'anime', 'series', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year.-Full', 'review', 'dvdverdict.com']",Rideback: The Complete Series

However, I got it recently--the price was right so I figured what the hey? I was glued to the TV from the first episode. It is only twelve episodes, so the character development is condensed but still good. Additionally, the story line is a bit weak--but I've probably just seen toooooo much anime.

1390238,A1RO76WBFX9XRJ,B0049TC8DK,NC,"[18, 22]","Originally passed Rideback up when it was airing. Then some people convinced me to check it out. They were right. This is a great show. Its a mix of mecha with motorcycle racing, and then dancing...sounds odd but it mixes well. There is a fair deal of action as well as some great characters and story. Plus Mell does the opening theme song. If you've seen Black Lagoon you've heard her before. She did the opening theme to that anime too. This time she does a bit of a racing beat which works real well. Great stuff.Right now the only downside I'm seeing to this release is the price. This is not a full 24-26 episode anime. Rideback is only 12 episodes. Plus if you like dubs, currently it is listed as being Japanese only. For $65, its a bit steep. This series should be in the $30-$40 price range. Hopefully they'll lower it before release. But even then, you can't really do wrong picking up this series, it is one of those rare gems in anime and its unfortunate that it only ran for 12 episodes.",5,Great show,1294704000,"01 11, 2011",2011,1001,"['Originally', 'passed', 'Rideback', 'up', 'when', 'was', 'airing', 'Then', 'people', 'convinced', 'check', 'out', 'were', 'right', 'great', 'show', 'mix', 'mecha', 'motorcycle', 'racing', 'then', 'dancing', 'odd', 'mixes', 'well', 'fair', 'deal', 'action', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'characters', 'story', 'Mell', 'opening', 'theme', 'song', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Black', 'Lagoon', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'before', 'did', 'opening', 'theme', 'anime', 'too', 'time', 'bit', 'racing', 'beat', 'real', 'well', 'Great', 'stuff.Right', 'now', 'only', 'downside', ""'m"", 'seeing', 'release', 'price', 'not', 'full', '24-26', 'episode', 'anime', 'Rideback', 'only', '12', 'episodes', 'like', 'dubs', 'currently', 'listed', 'being', 'Japanese', 'only', '65', 'bit', 'steep', 'series', 'should', 'be', '30-', '40', 'price', 'range', 'Hopefully', ""'ll"", 'lower', 'release', 'even', 'then', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'wrong', 'picking', 'up', 'series', 'one', 'rare', 'gems', 'anime', 'unfortunate', 'only', 'ran', '12', 'episodes']",Rideback: The Complete Series

Smith ""Steven Smith""","[3, 4]","Rideback is misleading from the very first trailer that I saw, or maybe FUNimation knows how to market to its consumers; but whatever the case-the series is not very good. The opening 9 episodes are slow, dull, and listless and tiresome on the eyes. The animation quality is mediocre at best, especially for a 2011 Blue Ray. The plot only picks up and starts to move at around episode 9 and then floors itself into episode 11 and 12 the best episodes. This is a story of a girl who falls of a horse and needs a help getting back on, that's the jist of the story. The horse would be her ballet and the help would be the rideback; fair, easy, not convoluted at ll. Yet the people she meets on her way are shallow and under developed, which makes you not care for them when the anime tries to have an emotional connection.

Great story, fabulous animation, vivid colours and the whole thing looks gorgeous. Nice use of the music ""Pictures at an Exhibition"" by Modest Mussorgsky. The piano playing is lovely, too.We meet Rin, a young ballerina who sustains an injury during a performance. She gives up ballet for her studies. The one rainy day she takes shelter in a garage and meets a Rideback club - a group of people dedicated to riding these strange contraptions which as a cross between a mecha and a motorcycle. Rin, by chance, becomes on of them....In the background an insidious organisation, the GGP, is attempting to force its world government onto the citizens of Japan. A rideback group called the BMA opposes the GGP with civil disobedience and Rin crosses their path.The story is rich and engaging, with lots of thrills and spills. I found the entire series a compelling experience on both an emotional and intellectual level.
