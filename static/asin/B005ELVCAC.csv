I suspect STRONGLY the persons benefitting from the sale of them have written most of the 5 star reviews and rated badly anyone stating anything negative on it...((after all it is the History Channel..so surely has many invested in it..what is to stop them?)They both totally ""chop up""  real footage from the war and using ""hollywood movie"" style music and sound effects in background. Much of the time you will be watching one of 3 or 4 different people sitting in their living room or standing with sunglasses on while ""remembering"" their own PERSONAL stories. Most would think they are actually watching a movie on WW2 while watching real colour footage from war and listening to same accounts of A FEW (3?) persons who fought in WW2.NOT A REAL DOCUMENTARY.

1456738,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005ELVCAC,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[67, 69]","Just in time for the holiday season, a Collector's Edition of the well regarded 2009 documentary miniseries ""WWII in HD"" is being released for the history buff on your list. There are a lot of ways to discuss this re-release, so I'll try to break things down into three categories: (1) review, (2) contents, and (3) DVD quality. Hopefully this will assist whether you are new to the series, considering a repurchase, or planning a gift. If you already own the previous version of this DVD or Blu-Ray release, this is probably NOT an essential upgrade. Although the set features two new full length documentaries, the contents and quality of the original miniseries has not been changed. So I can't really recommend a complete reinvestment just for the two new specials (which can be shopped individually if there is an interest).Review: From the 1970's exquisite and comprehensive ""World at War"" to Ken Burns' 2007 ""The War,"" there have been a number of significant pieces documenting World War II. Due to the closeness in timing, most will probably relate this to Burns' piece and both are certainly noteworthy in their own way. Some of the biggest advantages of ""WWII in HD"" is the use of color, the attention to the action in the Pacific Theater, and the powerful and gruesome imagery. This miniseries details 12 Americans as they navigated themselves through the war using their real words and thoughts to punctuate the recreations. It's strong stuff that really honors how ordinary citizens emerged as heroes. Narrated nicely by Gary Sinise, this is stylized and constructed in a modern way. Filled with quick cut editing and other effects, the presentation attempts to put you into the heart of the story. The use of name talent (including Josh Lucas, Rob Lowe, LL Cool J, Steve Zahn, and Jason Ritter to name a few) can be mildly distracting, but the scope of the experience can't be denied. In my opinion, this is an essential addition into the canon of World War II material. Effective and affecting, a true must for those with an interest in the subject.Set Contents: The History Channel miniseries runs for ten episodes--each approximately an hour. In addition, there is ""The Battle of Iwo Jima"" which hits the highlights of this pivotal battle and uses restored, full-color images in the telling. Also included is ""WWII in HD: The Air War,"" a solid recounting of the American air war over Europe in the days preceding D-Day. It's a rousing documentary that makes things very personal indeed, and it also features some exquisite color footage. If you watch a lot of non-fiction programming about World War II, you might be familiar with some of the footage utilized in these specials and in ""WWII in HD,"" but I think that's to be expected and does not detract from the experience. The Collector's Edition also repurposes the special features included in the original release including character profiles and two behind-the-scenes featurettes about finding and preserving the footage (a fascinating and extensive process in both regards). The Collector's Edition is 4 discs for Blu-ray and 5 discs for DVD (I have the Blu-ray, so I can't tell you how the assembly on the discs may differ). The Collector's Edition is packaged in a solid khaki green box of a woven texture with the title embossed in gold. It's very handsome and gift worthy.DVD/Blu-Ray Quality: One of the remarkable things about the miniseries is how it incorporates original color footage from World War II into mix, which is something that you don't often see. The modern day sequences are, of course, flawless and spectacular. The file material has been cleaned and restored to within an inch of its life. Depending on how and when it was shot, there can be a little distortion from aspect ratio variations and some of the colors (although real) lack the natural palette that we've become accustomed to. But the obvious care with which this piece was constructed is apparent in every frame. In my opinion, considering the age and condition of some of the source material, this Hi-Def DVD presentation is as crisp and beautiful as can be expected.

1456743,A2OBULJ18UYEUN,B005ELVCAC,Robert,"[5, 6]","I am aware that most World War II era color film was of the 16 mm variety and was shot during the Pacific campaign. Perhaps there was better access to unexposed color stock on the west coast of the United States. A great amount of the 16mm and 8mm color footage shot in Europe was by the Germans themselves. 8 mm was mostly used by German officers to document their experience in the form of ""home movies."" (Much is available on The Third Reich in Color series). An interesting brief use of early color film was also used during the SA/NAZI rally in Berlin in 1933. Another bit of German film was taken from the documetary ""Good Morning Mister Hitler"" and was shot by German color film buffs in July 1939. This is in addition to the now infamous Eva Braun films and the footage shot by Hiter's pilot. Much of the film from the American perspective during the European campaign was shot in black and white and then colorized (I believe by the British for their documentary - Color of War). Furthermore, George Stevens shot much of the 16mm color film seen in this film from D-Day until the close of the War (seen in his documentary ""From D-Day to Berlin""). This is not to say that the colorized footage is not also impressive, but I was quite surprised that the source was not mentioned or the fact that some of the film is colorized. It is not even mentioned by the producers in the Extra section.
