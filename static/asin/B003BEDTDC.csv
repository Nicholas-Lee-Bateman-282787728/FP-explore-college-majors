I actually bought this set specifically for the Season 4 bonus disc; since I have the bonus discs for Seasons 1-3.  Both my Blu-ray player AND PS3 spit the DVD back out stating a PAL disc/Region 2 could not be played; the listing and Blu-ray.com show the playback as 'region free'.  This Amazon listing show it as 'region 1', the blu-rays are playable, but apparently NOT the DVD; so this review is towards the product for sale; not the content.",1,Region 1 ???

The creator built himself an awesome red Ferrari and then drove it into the ditch.The first season is some of the best, most inspiring TV I've seen. It actually made me a better person - to try to be a hero in my own mundane way.Season two wasn't bad, but was too short due to the unfortunate writer's strike.But by the start of season three the show was in free-fall. I made it most of the way through episode 3 then gave up. I just didn't care any more. Based on what I've read on the internet the series just got worse after that.I did very much dislike the high level of visceral violence throughout the series. It's the kind of awful bloody meanness you might see in a horror movie. (I hate horror.)

1335468,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B003BEDTDC,Mike S.,"[1, 1]","Fair warning, there will be some spoilers in my review.  Heroes was a show that had a true ensemble case, which was made up of relatively unknown actors (at least when the series started).  There was no superstar actor that everyone would recognize.  As a result there were always multiple storylines going on, and it was truly a show that you had to watch from the beginning to really understand what was going on.The first and second seasons were very very good.  The first season was excellent, and like nothing that had been on TV.  You knew from the first episode what the characters were going to try to prevent, but there was no way of knowing how it was going to get there.  Because of the time travel aspect the story came in bits and pieces and sometimes out of order.  They did not reveal too much about each character too soon.  We never got to see Sylar until midway through the season, and HRG's (or as we would come to know him Noah Bennet)past and motivations were kept hidden until almost the end of the first season.I think the series had a clear goal of where it was going in the first and second seasons.  You could tell that it was meticulously planned out.  However the writer's strike ended the second season midway through, and it had to be cut short.  There were some stories from that season that were just abandoned entirely, and I thought those should have been wrapped up before proceeding how they did.  I think after that the writers never had a clear plan for the show.  I did not like how the third season made Nathan into a villain.  He had always had a grey moral compass, but it seemed that had gone away at the end of the first season and with the second.  But then he did a complete 180 (almost anyway) then they decided to try to make him likable again by giving the impression that he was just in over his head.I think the 4th season actually wrapped the series up very well.  While it was not intended to be the end of the show (it was not cancelled until after the season had ended), it tied up everyone's stories, and left a lot to your own imagination.  The reason I think the show declined, is that while the main ""big"" storylines changed every season, the individual stories within that got very repetitive.  They kept too many characters around for too long, and kept the characters going through the same conflicts and experiences over and over.  While this did change somewhat by the 4th season, I think too many people had abandoned the show by then.I definitely think it is better to see the series all at once.  The stories do tend to flow a little better than when there were months between seasons.  Plus it is just easier to follow with all the time jumps, flash-backs and character arcs. If you were a fan of the show, it is definitely worth adding to your collection.  The series looks great on blu ray, and there are a lot of entertaining extras.",4,Heroes was,1366675200,"04 23, 2013",2013,2904,"['Fair', 'warning', 'will', 'be', 'spoilers', 'review', 'Heroes', 'was', 'show', 'had', 'true', 'ensemble', 'case', 'was', 'made', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'actors', 'least', 'when', 'series', 'started', 'was', 'superstar', 'actor', 'everyone', 'would', 'recognize', 'result', 'were', 'always', 'multiple', 'storylines', 'going', 'was', 'truly', 'show', 'had', 'watch', 'beginning', 'really', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'first', 'second', 'seasons', 'were', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'excellent', 'nothing', 'had', 'been', 'TV', 'knew', 'first', 'episode', 'what', 'characters', 'were', 'going', 'try', 'prevent', 'was', 'way', 'knowing', 'how', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'there', 'time', 'travel', 'aspect', 'story', 'came', 'bits', 'pieces', 'order', 'did', 'not', 'reveal', 'too', 'much', 'character', 'too', 'soon', 'never', 'got', 'see', 'Sylar', 'midway', 'season', 'HRG', 'would', 'come', 'know', 'Noah', 'Bennet', 'past', 'motivations', 'were', 'kept', 'hidden', 'almost', 'end', 'first', 'season.I', 'think', 'series', 'had', 'clear', 'goal', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'first', 'second', 'seasons', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'meticulously', 'planned', 'out', 'However', 'writer', 'strike', 'ended', 'second', 'season', 'midway', 'had', 'be', 'cut', 'short', 'were', 'stories', 'season', 'were', 'just', 'abandoned', 'entirely', 'thought', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'wrapped', 'up', 'proceeding', 'how', 'did', 'think', 'writers', 'never', 'had', 'clear', 'plan', 'show', 'did', 'not', 'how', 'third', 'season', 'made', 'Nathan', 'villain', 'had', 'always', 'had', 'grey', 'moral', 'compass', 'seemed', 'had', 'gone', 'away', 'end', 'first', 'season', 'second', 'then', 'did', 'complete', '180', 'almost', 'anyway', 'then', 'decided', 'try', 'make', 'likable', 'again', 'giving', 'impression', 'was', 'just', 'over', 'head.I', 'think', '4th', 'season', 'actually', 'wrapped', 'series', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'was', 'not', 'intended', 'be', 'end', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'cancelled', 'season', 'had', 'ended', 'tied', 'up', 'everyone', 'stories', 'left', 'lot', 'own', 'imagination', 'reason', 'think', 'show', 'declined', 'main', 'big', 'storylines', 'changed', 'season', 'individual', 'stories', 'got', 'very', 'repetitive', 'kept', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'too', 'long', 'kept', 'characters', 'going', 'same', 'conflicts', 'experiences', 'over', 'did', 'change', 'somewhat', '4th', 'season', 'think', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'had', 'abandoned', 'show', 'then.I', 'definitely', 'think', 'better', 'see', 'series', 'once', 'stories', 'do', 'tend', 'flow', 'little', 'better', 'when', 'were', 'months', 'seasons', 'just', 'easier', 'follow', 'time', 'jumps', 'flash-backs', 'character', 'arcs', 'were', 'fan', 'show', 'definitely', 'worth', 'adding', 'collection', 'series', 'great', 'blu', 'ray', 'are', 'lot', 'entertaining', 'extras']",Heroes: The Complete Collection
