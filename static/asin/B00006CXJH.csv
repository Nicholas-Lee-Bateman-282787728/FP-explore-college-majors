712258,A32GCOTGFJ9XC3,B00006CXJH,"Alex Honda ""onyx575""","[7, 7]","Now that I've got your attention, I have to say that I was really worried about purchasing this ""Further Tales Of The City"" dvd set. It seems that many reviewers were having problems with the two-disc set, where either dvd would skip and freeze. Thankfully, my set didn't do that(whew!), but I have encountered dvds that did, so I can understand the frustration that many reviewers felt with this set.I'm not going to talk about the plot just what's on the dvds themselves. This edition of FTOTC seems to be the shortest of the three. It runs at about 180 minutes, whereas the previous two ran over 240 minutes each. The set contains two dvds, the first one contains the entire FTOTC show and runs straight through. Unlike the previous series, where each episode ended after an hour, this one plays right through. It's like watching a three-hour movie.The second dvd, contains all the special features including interviews with Maupin, director Pierre Gang, exec. prod. Suzanne Girard and Alan Poul, and the cast members (Linney, Garrick, Dukakis, et al). Also included are:*Selected scenes with commentary by Girard, Gang, Burroughs(mother mucca)and Hopkins(michael tolliver)*Behind the scenes footage*Alternate scenes w/commentary*Trailers from Showtime-I think that when it was originally aired, the show was broken into episodes and that's what these trailers represent*Still shots comparing the look of the characters from the 70s to the 80s*Cartoon of ""Queer Duck""-a funny little cartoon about a gay nurse who happens to be a duck. You can access this by selecting the ""Q"" on the main menu pageAnd the running time on dvd #2 is 143 minutes! That's a lot of extras!The show does stay remarkably true to the book with a little added to clarify things. Oh yes, there is full-frontal nudity in some scenes, like in the ""More Tales of the City"" mini-series, but it's all tastefully done.I would have given this five stars but I can't get used to Paul Hopkins as Mouse! Even though Hopkins does a terrific job, Marcus D'Amico brought something unique to that role. And while watching scenes with the new ""mouse,"" I find myself wondering what it would have been like had D'Amico continued on with the series.",4,Full-Frontal!,1161388800,"10 21, 2006",2006,2207,"['Now', ""'ve"", 'got', 'attention', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'really', 'worried', 'purchasing', 'Further', 'Tales', 'City', 'dvd', 'set', 'many', 'reviewers', 'were', 'having', 'problems', 'two-disc', 'set', 'where', 'dvd', 'would', 'skip', 'freeze', 'Thankfully', 'set', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'whew', 'have', 'encountered', 'dvds', 'did', 'can', 'understand', 'frustration', 'many', 'reviewers', 'felt', 'set.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'talk', 'plot', 'just', 'what', 'dvds', 'edition', 'FTOTC', 'be', 'shortest', 'three', '180', 'minutes', 'previous', 'two', 'ran', '240', 'minutes', 'set', 'two', 'dvds', 'first', 'one', 'entire', 'FTOTC', 'show', 'runs', 'straight', 'previous', 'series', 'where', 'episode', 'ended', 'hour', 'one', 'right', 'watching', 'three-hour', 'movie.The', 'second', 'dvd', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'interviews', 'Maupin', 'director', 'Pierre', 'Gang', 'exec', 'prod', 'Suzanne', 'Girard', 'Alan', 'Poul', 'cast', 'members', 'Linney', 'Garrick', 'Dukakis', 'et', 'al', 'Also', 'included', 'are', '*Selected', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'Girard', 'Gang', 'Burroughs', 'mucca', 'Hopkins', 'michael', 'tolliver', 'scenes', 'footage*Alternate', 'scenes', 'w/commentary*Trailers', 'Showtime-I', 'think', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'aired', 'show', 'was', 'broken', 'episodes', 'what', 'trailers', 'represent*Still', 'shots', 'comparing', 'look', 'characters', '70s', '80s*Cartoon', 'Queer', 'Duck', '-a', 'funny', 'little', 'cartoon', 'gay', 'nurse', 'who', 'be', 'duck', 'can', 'access', 'selecting', 'Q', 'main', 'menu', 'pageAnd', 'running', 'time', 'dvd', '2', '143', 'minutes', 'lot', 'extras', 'show', 'stay', 'remarkably', 'true', 'book', 'little', 'added', 'clarify', 'things', 'Oh', 'yes', 'full-frontal', 'nudity', 'scenes', 'More', 'Tales', 'City', 'mini-series', 'tastefully', 'done.I', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'five', 'stars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'used', 'Paul', 'Hopkins', 'Mouse', 'Even', 'Hopkins', 'terrific', 'job', 'Marcus', ""D'Amico"", 'brought', 'something', 'unique', 'role', 'watching', 'scenes', 'new', 'mouse', 'find', 'wondering', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'had', ""D'Amico"", 'continued', 'series']",N/A
712259,A3Q66OKHQ0FJUA,B00006CXJH,Ben Benji,"[27, 27]","This release consists of two disks.  The first features all four episodes of 'Further.'  The second, which I have yet to watch all of, contains the extras (those that I have seen are very good).My only problem with this release is that instead of screening all four episodes uncut, they have released them as a feature length movie.In Britain 'More' was released on video in the same format.  The result was that all the scenes at the start of each episode that had the cast/production credits on screen were cut so I, the viewer, missed out on a number of scenes.  I haven't seen the TV version of 'Further' so cannot comment on whether this dvd version has cut some scenes due to the on screen credits or whether they have included these scenes minus the on screen credits.  'More' was released as six episodes back to back.  'Further' should have been released this way as well.The production is classy although there are a few dodgy shots here and there, such as establishing shots of the ship spoilt by rain drops on the camera lens.Viewers of 'Tales' and 'More' should enjoy this release.  Viewers new to 'Tales of the City' will probably find the characters in 'Further' a bit cold and would be advised to watch the first two mini-series before watching 'Further'.Its hard to believe that in 2003 the first mini-series will be ten years old.

712262,A3BLK88R8PV1SE,B00006CXJH,"Bunny Man! ""mallard6""","[18, 18]","""Further Tales of the City"" continues in the fine tradition established by the first two dramatizations of Maupin's works. We can only hope for the last 3 books (and maybe ""Maybe the Moon"" as well??)Fortunately, the lion's share of actors from ""More Tales of the City"" continues into part three. It is critically important that Mary Ann and Anna Madrigal have been played throughout by the same fine actors, and it is a great bonus that Dee Dee has also had one performer. Her look in part three is quite a change from pts. 1-2; this woman has seen great changes in her life, and has weathered them well. The experience shows.Other important actors (especially Bryan, Michael, and Mother Mucca) continue from part two.It is amazing how much of the plot of the book, and how much of the actual language, has been able to be incorporated into this new series. The major substantive change was the incorporation of Mother Mucca (who appears only in book 2) and a whole new subplot into Further Tales. The major deletion was the ""gay bashing"" of Bryan and Michael, and the shifting of the wedding scene. None of this does violence to the original plot, and none will interfere into devoutly-desired future sequels, and they add richnesses of their own.I am a veteran of many readings of the books, and of frequent viewings of ""Tales"" and ""More Tales"", will certainly watch ""Further Tales"" repeatedly.Do get this and watch it!
