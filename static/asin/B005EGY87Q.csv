I may have enjoyed this movie if I were 10 or maybe if it had been a childhood favorite.  This was my first time to see this movie and last.,2,If you like watching things like Barney...maybe,1405900800,"07 21, 2014",2014,221,"['was', 'very', 'creative', 'thinking', 'story', 'writer', 'was', 'high', 'something', 'may', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'were', '10', 'maybe', 'had', 'been', 'childhood', 'favorite', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'movie', 'last']",N/A

They were never very good, but they were what was available at the time, I guess. Perhaps if I were a child I might find the movie entertaining, but it seemed a bit ridiculous to me. I almost turned it off as soon as I saw that the &#34;Luck Dragon&#34; was really a flying dog.",2,Not good,1405900800,"07 21, 2014",2014,354,"['movie', 'kind', 'silly', 'movies', 'used', 'watch', 'kid', 'were', 'never', 'very', 'good', 'were', 'what', 'was', 'available', 'time', 'guess', 'Perhaps', 'were', 'child', 'might', 'find', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'seemed', 'bit', 'ridiculous', 'almost', 'turned', 'off', 'as', 'soon', 'saw', '34', 'Luck', 'Dragon', '34', 'was', 'really', 'flying', 'dog']",N/A

As a child it's easy for your imagination to run wild and this movie really did a great job of capturing the imagination a child has. That said I am sad to go back to this movie as I simply cannot view it in the same way I did all those years ago. I never read the book but I know the movie ends too soon and I'm not sure why that is or why they never properly finished it. I don't care for the ending all that much. I would've liked to see more of the Fantasia that is told in this story. That being said this ranks up there with 80's fantasy classics such as The Empire Strikes Back and The Dark Crystal. There's simply nothing like watching it for the first time as a child.,4,A favorite of my childhood,1405209600,"07 13, 2014",2014,785,"['saw', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'about', '5', '6', 'was', 'very', 'enthralled', 'practically', 'everything', 'movie', 'child', 'easy', 'imagination', 'run', 'wild', 'movie', 'really', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'capturing', 'imagination', 'child', 'said', 'am', 'sad', 'go', 'back', 'movie', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'view', 'same', 'way', 'did', 'years', 'ago', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'know', 'movie', 'too', 'soon', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'why', 'never', 'properly', 'finished', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'ending', 'much', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'Fantasia', 'told', 'story', 'being', 'said', 'up', 'there', '80', 'fantasy', 'classics', 'such', 'Empire', 'Strikes', 'Back', 'Dark', 'Crystal', 'simply', 'nothing', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'child']",N/A
