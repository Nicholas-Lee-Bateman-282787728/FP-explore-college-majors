406383,A1S3C5OFU508P3,630417960X,Charles Ashbacher,"[0, 0]","This episode is one with a very weak plot and an ending that just falls completely flat. Commander Riker is on an R & R break with a woman and she introduces him to a game. A headset generates images of funnels that can be moved via thought and the goal is to capture disks in the funnels. While it appears innocuous, the game is one that stimulates the brain in such a way that the person can be manipulated and controlled. Riker brings the game back to the Enterprise and introduces it to the rest of the crew. The crew becomes incrementally addicted and under the control of the woman who originally gave Riker the headpiece.Wesley Crusher is on leave from Star Fleet Academy and back on the Enterprise. There is a young woman who was recently assigned to the Enterprise played by Ashley Judd. They become friends and notice how the crew is becoming attached to the game and acting strangely. Wesley is particularly concerned when Data somehow becomes incapacitated and no one seems to be willing or able to help him. Finally, when Wesley and his new friend run a simulation on the device they learn that it is addictive and leaves the player open to suggestion.Wesley notifies Captain Picard of the effects, but it is too late, Picard has already come under the influence of the game. Wesley learns what has happened to Data and attempts to repair him. Finally, Wesley and his friend are in engineering and too late, Wesley learns that she is now under the influence of the game. This sets off an extreme form of pursuit, where the entire crew is chasing Wesley throughout the ship. He is eventually captured at the time when the Enterprise crew is being ordered to turn their ship over to the criminals and begin passing the mind control devices to other Federation ships. Fortunately, Wesley was able to restore Data and Data discovers and executes a cure for the affliction.What makes this episode so weak is how easy it is for the bad people to take over the minds of the Enterprise crew. The Enterprise is the flagship of the Federation, so one would think that there would be more checks on the behavior of the crew than what is exhibited here. Recall how many times the original Enterprise crew encountered species capable of entering their minds. Finally, even though Wesley saved the Enterprise and perhaps even the entire Federation, he receives no commendation or even a thank you from Picard. He simply packs his bags and goes back to school. In an organization like Star Fleet such a commendation or a positive note in the Captain's log would be a very natural action.",3,One of the more absurd plots and an extremely unpalatable ending,1180310400,"05 28, 2007",2007,2585,"['episode', 'one', 'very', 'weak', 'plot', 'ending', 'just', 'completely', 'flat', 'Commander', 'Riker', 'R', 'R', 'break', 'woman', 'game', 'headset', 'images', 'funnels', 'can', 'be', 'moved', 'thought', 'goal', 'capture', 'disks', 'funnels', 'innocuous', 'game', 'one', 'brain', 'such', 'way', 'person', 'can', 'be', 'manipulated', 'controlled', 'Riker', 'game', 'back', 'Enterprise', 'introduces', 'rest', 'crew', 'crew', 'incrementally', 'addicted', 'control', 'woman', 'who', 'originally', 'gave', 'Riker', 'headpiece.Wesley', 'Crusher', 'leave', 'Star', 'Fleet', 'Academy', 'back', 'Enterprise', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'recently', 'assigned', 'Enterprise', 'played', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'become', 'friends', 'notice', 'how', 'crew', 'becoming', 'attached', 'game', 'acting', 'strangely', 'Wesley', 'particularly', 'concerned', 'when', 'Data', 'somehow', 'incapacitated', 'one', 'be', 'willing', 'able', 'help', 'Finally', 'when', 'Wesley', 'new', 'friend', 'simulation', 'device', 'learn', 'addictive', 'player', 'open', 'suggestion.Wesley', 'notifies', 'Captain', 'Picard', 'effects', 'too', 'late', 'Picard', 'already', 'come', 'influence', 'game', 'Wesley', 'what', 'happened', 'Data', 'attempts', 'repair', 'Finally', 'Wesley', 'friend', 'are', 'engineering', 'too', 'late', 'Wesley', 'now', 'influence', 'game', 'off', 'extreme', 'form', 'pursuit', 'where', 'entire', 'crew', 'chasing', 'Wesley', 'ship', 'eventually', 'captured', 'time', 'when', 'Enterprise', 'crew', 'being', 'ordered', 'turn', 'ship', 'criminals', 'begin', 'passing', 'mind', 'control', 'devices', 'other', 'Federation', 'ships', 'Fortunately', 'Wesley', 'was', 'able', 'restore', 'Data', 'Data', 'discovers', 'cure', 'affliction.What', 'episode', 'so', 'weak', 'how', 'easy', 'bad', 'people', 'take', 'over', 'minds', 'Enterprise', 'crew', 'Enterprise', 'flagship', 'Federation', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'checks', 'behavior', 'crew', 'what', 'exhibited', 'here', 'Recall', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'original', 'Enterprise', 'crew', 'encountered', 'species', 'capable', 'entering', 'minds', 'Finally', 'even', 'Wesley', 'saved', 'Enterprise', 'perhaps', 'even', 'entire', 'Federation', 'commendation', 'even', 'thank', 'Picard', 'simply', 'bags', 'back', 'school', 'organization', 'Star', 'Fleet', 'commendation', 'positive', 'note', 'Captain', 'log', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'natural', 'action']","Star Trek - The Next Generation, Episode 106: The Game VHS"

But this one, &quot;The Game&quot;, is the one that fascinates me the most.It seemed to be an innocent game. Riker was introduced to it by one of his female companions while on leave. It was HIGHLY addictive. He brought it back on board ship, had it replicated, and the game caught on like wild fire! EVERYONE was hooked! They played the game even while they worked. Only Wesley Crusher and one other female friend of his were wary. They realized the addictive game was not natural.Wesley Crusher vs the entire ship. Talk about bad odds! But this nimble and intellegent teenager amazed me. To tell more would spoil it.Considering only 3 episodes stand out for me (&quot;True Q&quot;, &quot;Remember Me&quot;, and &quot;The Game&quot;), I cannot help but post this in hopes that someone else will fall in love with these perticular 3.",5,My all time favorite episode!,1002585600,"10 9, 2001",2001,913,"['son', 'favorite', 'episode', 'quot', 'Remember', 'Me', 'quot', 'admit', 'AWESOME', 'one', 'quot', 'Game', 'quot', 'one', 'most.It', 'seemed', 'be', 'innocent', 'game', 'Riker', 'was', 'introduced', 'one', 'female', 'companions', 'leave', 'was', 'HIGHLY', 'addictive', 'brought', 'back', 'board', 'ship', 'had', 'replicated', 'game', 'caught', 'wild', 'fire', 'EVERYONE', 'was', 'hooked', 'played', 'game', 'even', 'worked', 'Only', 'Wesley', 'Crusher', 'one', 'other', 'female', 'friend', 'were', 'wary', 'realized', 'addictive', 'game', 'was', 'not', 'natural.Wesley', 'Crusher', 'vs', 'entire', 'ship', 'Talk', 'bad', 'odds', 'nimble', 'intellegent', 'teenager', 'amazed', 'tell', 'more', 'would', 'spoil', 'it.Considering', 'only', '3', 'episodes', 'stand', 'out', 'quot', 'True', 'Q', 'quot', 'quot', 'Remember', 'Me', 'quot', 'quot', 'Game', 'quot', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'post', 'hopes', 'someone', 'else', 'will', 'fall', 'love', 'perticular', '3']","Star Trek - The Next Generation, Episode 106: The Game VHS"

Reynolds,"[2, 3]","This engrossing episode involved an evil electronic device that lured almost everyone on the Enterprise into a state of addicted, malleable euphoria.  ALMOST everyone, that is, except for Wesly Crusher, who was visiting from Starfleet Academy.Wesley noticed the crew behaving strangely, analyed the device, located the knocked-out Data and determined how to reactivate him, then arranged for same to appear just at the right moment and de-hypnotize the command staff -- which saved not only the Enterprise itself, but (per instructions being executed) several star bases, the Academy and, pretty much, the entire Federation.Wesley, at this point, having bravely and cleverly prevented enslavement of the whole civilized universe, deserved nothing less than to be promoted to full starship captain... but no, he just kissed Ashley Judd goodbye and went back to school.  It was a grave injustice, and I have never been more depressed after watching a Star Trek episode.

I also thought Lefler was cute when this came out.I don't know how this would have worked on Geordi though-a blind manAlso, it would have been interesting to see how they got Worf to play (it doesn't really seem like his ""thing""). Although I suppose the counselor may have gotten him to. Or even Picard, with a playful, ""I order you to take some time off, Mr. Worf! Relax-play a game""The one person who I am really surprised at was Guinan. Her character would really seem to have been a person to have been hard to get to play.
