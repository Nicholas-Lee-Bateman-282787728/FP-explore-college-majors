893279,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B0007XBM34,blackaciddevil,"[2, 2]","Originally running from 1967 to 1968 in America as a children's cartoon show, Speed Racer found its' place in our culture. The series was originally released in Japan by Tatsunoko Productions under the name ""Mach Go Go Go"", which itself was a manga published in Shueisha's 1958 Shnen Book. Mach GoGoGo was first created and designed by anime pioneer Tatsuo Yoshida (1932-1977). The actual manga was inspired by Yoshida's earlier, and most popular automobile racing comic, ""Pilot Ace"". Yoshida got the idea for his story after seeing two films that were very popular in Japan at the time, ""Viva Las Vegas"" and ""Goldfinger"". By combining the look of Elvis Presley's race-car driving image from the time and James Bond's gadget-filled Aston Martin, Yoshida had the inspiration for Speed Racer.Volume 3 contains episodes 24-36. They originally aired between December 8, 1967 and January 19, 1968. Just in case you're just coming on board to the whole Speed Racer thing, here's a little recap...Speed Racer is the world's greatest racer, thanks to his car- the Mach 5. Along with his family and friends, Speed gets into all types of crazy adventures. Most of the episodes are two-parters, while there are some that are stand-alone stories. Racer X makes his appearances in this set as well.Admittedly, the video quality on this set is a bit lower in comparison to the first two sets on DVD.  The episodes themselves look abit grainy. While the grainy look is glaringly obvious, it doesn't take away too much from things. As for special features, sadly- there are none to speak of. You'd think with Speed being part of our american culture as much as it is, you'd see more. Unfortunately, there are none.Overall, the third set is a great addition to your collection of Speed Racer cartoons, despite the aforementioned comments. It's well worth grabbing if you're a big Speed Racer fan.",5,"Speed Racer, Volume 3.......",1236038400,"03 3, 2009",2009,1879,"['Originally', 'running', '1967', '1968', 'America', 'children', 'cartoon', 'show', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'found', ""'"", 'place', 'culture', 'series', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'Japan', 'Tatsunoko', 'Productions', 'name', 'Mach', 'Go', 'Go', 'Go', 'was', 'manga', 'published', 'Shueisha', '1958', 'Shnen', 'Book', 'Mach', 'GoGoGo', 'was', 'first', 'created', 'designed', 'anime', 'pioneer', 'Tatsuo', 'Yoshida', '1932-1977', 'actual', 'manga', 'was', 'inspired', 'Yoshida', 'earlier', 'most', 'popular', 'automobile', 'racing', 'comic', 'Pilot', 'Ace', 'Yoshida', 'got', 'idea', 'story', 'seeing', 'two', 'films', 'were', 'very', 'popular', 'Japan', 'time', 'Viva', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Goldfinger', 'combining', 'look', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'race-car', 'driving', 'image', 'time', 'James', 'Bond', 'gadget-filled', 'Aston', 'Martin', 'Yoshida', 'had', 'inspiration', 'Speed', 'Racer.Volume', '3', 'contains', 'episodes', '24-36', 'originally', 'aired', 'December', '8', '1967', 'January', '19', '1968', 'Just', 'case', ""'re"", 'just', 'coming', 'board', 'whole', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'thing', 'here', 'little', 'recap', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'world', 'greatest', 'racer', 'thanks', 'car-', 'Mach', '5', 'family', 'friends', 'Speed', 'types', 'crazy', 'adventures', 'Most', 'episodes', 'are', 'two-parters', 'are', 'are', 'stand-alone', 'stories', 'Racer', 'X', 'appearances', 'set', 'well.Admittedly', 'video', 'quality', 'set', 'bit', 'lower', 'comparison', 'first', 'two', 'sets', 'DVD', 'episodes', 'look', 'abit', 'grainy', 'grainy', 'look', 'glaringly', 'obvious', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'things', 'special', 'features', 'sadly-', 'are', 'none', 'speak', ""'d"", 'think', 'Speed', 'being', 'part', 'american', 'culture', 'as', 'much', ""'d"", 'see', 'more', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'third', 'set', 'great', 'addition', 'collection', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'cartoons', 'aforementioned', 'comments', 'well', 'worth', 'grabbing', ""'re"", 'big', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'fan']",N/A

Wallis Davenport ""joyous2""","[4, 4]","Speed Racer was one of my fav cartoons as a little girl, and so I naturally bought the series for my own 6 year old daughter.  Need I tell you she loves it?These are exciting stories, terrific animation, and I feel I should say that it offers good role models for women.  Many of the women in Speed Racer are daredevils themselves, and Trixie always stood up tall in her role as well.  Speed Racer does have somewhat of a violent undertone (that my mother hated), but I feel it's no worse than any other cartoon violence you have seen anywhere else.  It doesn't seem at all gratuitous, either, but is used to carry the story.I loved the names of the characters, too.  In the first episode of this Vol. (#24), we meet Prince Jam, Prince Sac-Charin, and further references to sugary sweets in the names.  I think this adds to the charm and also makes Speed Racer equally fun for the adult viewer.My favorite episode of all times is on this Vol. - Man on the Lam.  It starts out with a man escaping from prison, and then meeting a blind little girl.  A few twists and a surprise ending are in this story.  Holds up well over time!  I think if you grew up on Speed Racer, you will enjoy watching this again, and introducing it to your own kids, either boys or girls.",4,"Excitement, Fun, and good role models for Girls and Boys",1210896000,"05 16, 2008",2008,1262,"['Speed', 'Racer', 'was', 'one', 'fav', 'cartoons', 'little', 'girl', 'so', 'naturally', 'bought', 'series', 'own', '6', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Need', 'tell', 'are', 'exciting', 'stories', 'terrific', 'animation', 'feel', 'should', 'say', 'good', 'role', 'models', 'women', 'Many', 'women', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'are', 'Trixie', 'always', 'stood', 'up', 'tall', 'role', 'as', 'well', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'have', 'somewhat', 'violent', 'undertone', 'mother', 'hated', 'feel', 'worse', 'other', 'cartoon', 'violence', 'have', 'seen', 'anywhere', 'else', ""n't"", 'seem', 'gratuitous', 'either', 'used', 'carry', 'story.I', 'loved', 'names', 'characters', 'too', 'first', 'episode', 'Vol', '24', 'meet', 'Prince', 'Jam', 'Prince', 'Sac-Charin', 'further', 'references', 'sugary', 'sweets', 'names', 'think', 'charm', 'also', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'equally', 'adult', 'favorite', 'episode', 'times', 'Vol', 'Man', 'Lam', 'out', 'man', 'escaping', 'prison', 'then', 'meeting', 'blind', 'little', 'girl', 'few', 'twists', 'surprise', 'ending', 'are', 'story', 'up', 'well', 'time', 'think', 'grew', 'up', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'will', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'again', 'introducing', 'own', 'kids', 'boys', 'girls']",N/A

I always laughed myself onto the floor watching Spritle's tears spraying out like a fountain.

In fact the mismatched mouth movements (seemingly due to more than translation) and coarse animation only added to it's unique charm.  I've waited a long time for a collection like this.HOWEVER, I agree with other reviewers in that Lion's Gate should include the ORIGINAL JAPANESE theme song, and it would be GREAT to have a whole episode in Japanese as it aired in Japan.  That would make this a much better collection.Also, they should put forth some effort to improve the video quality.  I have a VHS tape that provides better image quality.

893288,A1EEG7YJIYN60B,B0007XBM34,Lesley Aeschliman,"[2, 2]","This DVD contains episodes twenty-four through thirty-six of the Speed Racer anime series.  Because thirteen episodes were crammed onto the disc, the video quality is noticeably lower when compared to the first two DVDs.  In fact, when I was watching some of the episodes, the picture was noticeably fuzzy, and this made it harder to enjoy the episodes.  Also, with thirteen episodes on the disc, there are absolutely no special features included.The copy I purchased of this DVD came in a circular tin that is supposed to resemble a tire, and a cardboard slipcover slides over the tin.  Unfortunately, there is no hub in the tin to hold the DVD steady, so the disc just slides around in the packaging.  This means that there's a greater chance that the DVD could become damaged if it's left in that packaging.I'm at a loss as to why thirteen episodes were crammed onto this disc, especially since the last two volumes only contain eight episodes each.  If it had been up to me, I would have split it out this way: disc one would have had 11 episodes, the second disc would have had ten episodes, disc three would have had eleven episodes, and discs four and five would have had ten episodes each.  Also, I would have tried to spread the special features across all of the discs a little more evenly.If you're a Speed Racer fan that wants to have all of the episodes on DVD, then you need to pick this up.

The packaging does not adequately protect the DVD and the fact that there are no extras is a real shame. It would be GREAT if the producers of this DVD collection would put the orginal Japanese version of the theme song and opening titles on one of these volumes as an extra feature. Instead, there are no extras at all, fun or not, on this release.",3,"Great cartoons, but DVD has some deficiencies",1125100800,"08 27, 2005",2005,878,"['cartoons', 'are', 'terrific', 'cheesy', 'depending', 'point', 'view', ""'re"", 'pure', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'so', 'like', 'sharing', 'old', 'cartoons', 'children', 'be', 'sure', 'add', 'collection', 'would', 'give', 'set', 'higher', 'rating', 'just', 'cartoons', 'packaging', 'real', 'issue', 'volume', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'collection', 'hence', '3-star', 'rating.All', 'problems', 'release', 'relate', 'packaging', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'quality', 'inventiveness', 'previous', 'two', 'volumes', 'packaging', 'not', 'adequately', 'protect', 'DVD', 'fact', 'are', 'extras', 'real', 'shame', 'would', 'be', 'GREAT', 'producers', 'DVD', 'collection', 'would', 'put', 'orginal', 'Japanese', 'version', 'theme', 'song', 'opening', 'titles', 'one', 'volumes', 'extra', 'feature', 'Instead', 'are', 'extras', 'fun', 'not', 'release']",N/A

But as everyone else has said- there is a chance of it scratching because there is space for it to bounce around, which can cause the disc to chip or scratch at the edge.What Family Home Entertainment should have done is :1. Put the disc in a rugular dvd case2. Make a Tin Case to put the dvd case inThis way the disc can be protected and still have a tin case for it to be a special edition. This is was just a suggestion. Maybe Family Home Entertainment might redo it if people sent them e mails or letters stating it.Now as for the extras. There's none on this edition. Just the episodes and that's all.I will say that Family Home Entertainment has done a wonderful job so far with the Speed Racer Series. Putting it on dvd as special editions it so deservers. Keep up the good work! oh and could you guys maybe release the 4th volume a bit sooner? I don't want to wait another year for it to be released. =)",4,It's Different,1117843200,"06 4, 2005",2005,1050,"['rest', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'edition', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'Volume', '3', 'round', 'tin', 'case', 'foam', 'protect', 'disc', 'everyone', 'else', 'said-', 'chance', 'scratching', 'space', 'bounce', 'around', 'can', 'cause', 'disc', 'chip', 'scratch', 'Family', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'should', 'have', 'done', ':1', 'Put', 'disc', 'rugular', 'dvd', 'case2', 'Make', 'Tin', 'Case', 'put', 'dvd', 'case', 'inThis', 'way', 'disc', 'can', 'be', 'protected', 'still', 'have', 'tin', 'case', 'be', 'special', 'edition', 'was', 'just', 'suggestion', 'Maybe', 'Family', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'might', 'redo', 'people', 'sent', 'e', 'mails', 'letters', 'stating', 'it.Now', 'extras', 'none', 'edition', 'Just', 'episodes', 'all.I', 'will', 'say', 'Family', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'done', 'wonderful', 'job', 'so', 'far', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'Series', 'Putting', 'dvd', 'special', 'editions', 'so', 'Keep', 'good', 'work', 'oh', 'could', 'guys', 'maybe', 'release', '4th', 'volume', 'bit', 'sooner', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'wait', 'year', 'be', 'released', '=']",N/A
