I swear, his voice over is getting so old and stale, and on this DVD, it just puts me to sleep. It just sounds like ""Yosemite was... blah,blah,blah ... President Roosevelt... blah,blah,blah...""  And, the picture isn't that great... not like the 70mm filming that something like the movie Baraka had. It seems like any half-talented junior college student could have pieced together this DVD with grainy, archival footage and lousy voice over. How come we see so little of the desert too? Its all about the main stream parks like Yosemite and Yellowstone, like we haven't seen a hundred films about that by now. What a joke! What a total piece of garbage! Ken Burns, failed once again.

1259886,A3QIEISBZP4QTV,B002BO2R4K,,"[21, 35]","This should have been entitled ""A Political History of National Parks"".  And even if it would have had that title, it would still be boring.How can a respected film-maker like Ken Burns whose previous series are endlessly entertaining and informative at the same time (which is what a documentary should be), come up with this poorly edited, poorly written montage of political interviews?  The answer is he didn't.  The credits note that Dayton Duncan actually wrote the show.  Dayton Duncan is a leftist bureacrat who wrote a book called ""Out West"" about 20 years ago where he did a modern day car trip that roughly paralleled Lewis and Clark.  So I warn you that you think you are getting a Burns documentary but it is really not his product.  Kind of like the latest Tom Clancy books that are plastered with his name but turn out to have been ""inspired"" by Clancy or he has read over the plot of some other author.  Not the same thing at all.So you have to watch this knowing that it really isn't the typical Ken Burns product.Also the series is mostly about the politics behind the National Parks.  Which is an interesting subject but not necessarily what you think you are getting.  And even when this series is lecturing on some political struggle, it could have actually showed you parks instead of some scruffy-looking, boring ranger.I really wanted to like this series.  As a biologist, I am in love with the American National Parks idea.  I enjoy history and politics.  But this series is not at all what it could and should have been.  A couple of hours is plenty to discuss the politics of National Parks.The worst part of this series is frankly that it is boring.  How do you take a majestic subject like National Parks and make it boring?  Even if you only concentrate on politics, there have been enough political shenanigans involving them that it would be hard not to make this interesting and even controversial.  I think that Duncan was trying to give us an environmental and political lecture and hiding it behind the National Parks idea.  These are not compatible, in my view.  Also, many of the lecturers are the same tired bunch of people that have popped up in Duncan's writings for decades.  I've read their thoughts before and didn't find this reincarnation to be any different.I fear the glowing pollyanna-like 5 star reviews have mostly not watched the series, and if they have, they are simply stating that they like wilderness and National Park ideals (as do I).I've been in the Sierra Club, I've worked in this field, and I still had to force myself to watch these episodes hoping that the next part would be better.  Way too often I woke up an hour later snoring.  2 stars is the best I could muster for this mixed-up and poorly edited series. Before you buy, by all means check out the 5 star reviews also.

Then there was a ridiculous amount of commentary and interpretations by various self-agrandising environmental group spokesmen lecturing you on how you should feel about the parks--instead of showing you and evoking the feelings like when you actually go to the parks.After a while of listening to the verbosity, I started wishing we could go back to the days of silent films.Anyway, I have visited most of our National Parks, and this series almost ruined my memories about what is so great about them.

The majestic sequoias in Yosemite to the beauty of the Great Smoky Mountains. I felt so fortunate to be able to gaze upon these vistas, and have the luxury of being able to come back to them often, I never imagined that the creation of these Parks was not an easy process. It was surprising to learn that it took massive effort to create these parks I took for granted, that their creation was embroiled in politics and vested interests of those who wanted to exploit these natural resources.This documentary tells us of visionaries like John Muir who spent their life trying to show their countrymen just why we needed to preserve these vast areas of natural beauty and bustling wildlife. Artists like Obata who came from Japan to Ansel Adams who painted and photographed the glories of these parks to show just why we needed to preserve this land in it's natural state. From FDR to Ickes who used loopholes in law to designate these parks as national monuments.The documentary explores periods from the late 1800s to 1990s through the turmoil of war and Depression and how the idea preserved through the years through incessant efforts of a few. It has interviews from historians and writers who speak of the forces that tried to prevent the parks from coming into existence and the few who supported it. There are some very heartfelt and emotional moments during these interviews. The common thread that connected all those who fought for the parks' survival was the belief that these parks were meant to be accessed by all -irrespective of their financial status or their skin color.I think that this documentary is so inspirational and deeply moving because it is not just about the parks and their beauty, it gives you an insight into the mind of the visionaries who made America what it is today. It is a powerful depiction of how the American ideals of truth, beauty and goodness, and liberty are represented in creation of the National Parks. After viewing this documentary I feel deeply grateful to those who allowed me to experience this beauty.

Whether it is interesting enough to sit through depends on what your expectations are and whether you like learning about history. Personally, I think The National Parks is an incredible achievement in documentary filmmaking and is incredibly interesting through and through, especially on Blu-ray. I saw the first episode on TV and thought it was interesting, but I was a bit disappointed somehow. Then I rented the 2nd and 3rd episodes on DVD and found my enjoyment of the series increased and liked it enough to want to buy it. Going back through the episodes on Blu-ray, my enjoyment was furthered and I was captivated by everything, as if I'd never seen it before. When reflecting on my disappointment with the first episode when I saw it broadcast on TV, I realized the reason why. Presentation is everything!The picture quality on the blu-ray is far better than the broadcast and a step or two above the DVD. The old photographs have so much intricate detail and texture, that they seem almost unreal. I love how they decided to shoot the entire documentary on Super 16 film. For the outdoor scenes, the film's stock emphasizes color and texture, making the shots look more like paintings, which seems to be what they were going for, especially when you see actual vintage paintings of the various landscapes. They blend together so well. I'm glad that they went that route, preferring an artistic viewpoint that blends the different visual pieces together rather than utilizing the BBC Earth style of capturing nature in intricate detail.

It reminds me of the great job he did on Lewis and Clark and Mark Twain.  His films all have a certain look to them.  He likes combining footage of the subject matter today as well as images and writings from the past. With image upon image being of the USA's national parks, this is a win-win deal for him.  All of his work has that PBS feel to it and this is no exception.  If you have seen one Burns documentary series for PBS, you have seen all of them as far as the way they are done.  He goes from point A to point B in all of them the exact same way.  Normally I might fault an artist for this.

1259903,A11OTLEDSW8ZXD,B002BO2R4K,CGScammell,"[20, 35]","This six-part set is a work of love and passion from both Ken Burns and David Duncan.  Burns produced this, Duncan wrote this, so there's no wonder this project was a success.  It keeps the viewer spell-bound.I spent two months this past summer road-triping across the country and logging in over 13,000 miles.  I got to see several national parks along the way, many for the first time.  My complaint about many of the parks was that I saw so few minorities:  that despite once being sacred lands to many Native American tribes, very few Native Americans were employed at any of the parks I visited except for the Little Big Horn National Battlefield in Montana.  The only park that hired any African Americans was Yellowstone, so it was nice to listen to Shelton Johnson, an African-American park ranger at Yellowstone, tell visitors the history of Yellowstone and how many Buffalo Soldiers helped guard this park from poachers and collectors.Ken Burns' and David Duncan's passion for this film radiates throughout the interviews in this production, a production that took two years longer to produce because the crew was in part captivated by the beauty of all the parks they visited.This documentary is more than just breath-taking photography, it's the behind-the-scenes history of Native Americans losing many of their best lands, the pleading from wealthy socialites to preserve these lands, the blood and sweat of soldiers and poor people to help protect these wild places.  The contributions of so many diverse Americans, from not just wealthy Anglos but also the before-mentioned African- and Native-Americans (many who were forced out of these new parks under Eminent Domain), Mexicans (San Antonio mission) new immigrants, talented writers like John Muir, outdoor photographers such as John Muir, determined women (many of them minorities, too) who fought the US government to preserve some of the lesser-known parks in our country, and of course wilderness lovers such as President Theodore Roosevelt are all fetured in this work. In fact, the second episode deals with mostly TR's tireless efforts to get national parks established and is perhaps my favorite episode of them all.I have seen quite a few of our national parks over the years and had always been fascinated by the little-known histories of each location.  A lot of these histories come alive in this documentary.  ""The other part of history"" and ""democracy"" resonate across many of the interviewees in this production.  American Heritage and American Patriotism for all Americans are what oozes from these episodes as the viewer gets enraptured in the documentary.""Wow, I didn't know that!"" is what I'm sure many viewers will say after watching this, especially after watching the Mount Rushmore episode.  So much untold history comes alive, and not all of this history is in school text books, either.There are over 50 national parks and over 300 national historical sites in our country and almost all of them are featured in this documentary.  The good and bad of these many sites, from former Japanese internment sites (Manzanar) to former Indian battlefields  (Little Big Horn) and other battlesites (San Antonio and the Spanish missions) get their fame in this well-produced project.  Educational, emotional, awe-inspiring and beautiful, there is little wonder than anything less from the Burns-Duncan team was not expected.  Although I'm not sure why the episode ""City Kids in National Parks"" was all that important for this set, overall this documentary is true American History in which all groups of Americans have played their part in making these parks what they are today.",5,"History, People and natural beauty all wrapped into one production",1249862400,"08 10, 2009",2009,3663,"['six-part', 'set', 'work', 'love', 'passion', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'David', 'Duncan', 'Burns', 'produced', 'Duncan', 'wrote', 'wonder', 'project', 'was', 'success', 'viewer', 'spell-bound.I', 'spent', 'two', 'months', 'past', 'summer', 'road-triping', 'country', 'logging', '13,000', 'miles', 'got', 'see', 'several', 'national', 'parks', 'way', 'many', 'first', 'time', 'complaint', 'many', 'parks', 'was', 'saw', 'so', 'few', 'minorities', 'once', 'being', 'sacred', 'lands', 'many', 'Native', 'American', 'tribes', 'very', 'few', 'Native', 'Americans', 'were', 'employed', 'parks', 'visited', 'Little', 'Big', 'Horn', 'National', 'Battlefield', 'Montana', 'only', 'park', 'hired', 'African', 'Americans', 'was', 'Yellowstone', 'was', 'nice', 'listen', 'Shelton', 'Johnson', 'African-American', 'park', 'ranger', 'Yellowstone', 'tell', 'visitors', 'history', 'Yellowstone', 'how', 'many', 'Buffalo', 'Soldiers', 'helped', 'guard', 'park', 'poachers', 'collectors.Ken', 'Burns', 'David', 'Duncan', 'passion', 'film', 'interviews', 'production', 'production', 'took', 'two', 'years', 'longer', 'produce', 'crew', 'was', 'part', 'captivated', 'beauty', 'parks', 'visited.This', 'documentary', 'more', 'just', 'breath-taking', 'photography', 'behind-the-scenes', 'history', 'Native', 'Americans', 'losing', 'many', 'best', 'lands', 'pleading', 'wealthy', 'socialites', 'preserve', 'lands', 'blood', 'sweat', 'soldiers', 'poor', 'people', 'help', 'protect', 'wild', 'places', 'contributions', 'so', 'many', 'diverse', 'Americans', 'not', 'just', 'wealthy', 'Anglos', 'also', 'before-mentioned', 'African-', 'Native-Americans', 'many', 'who', 'were', 'forced', 'new', 'parks', 'Eminent', 'Domain', 'Mexicans', 'San', 'Antonio', 'mission', 'new', 'immigrants', 'talented', 'writers', 'John', 'Muir', 'outdoor', 'photographers', 'such', 'John', 'Muir', 'determined', 'women', 'many', 'minorities', 'too', 'who', 'fought', 'US', 'government', 'preserve', 'lesser-known', 'parks', 'country', 'course', 'wilderness', 'lovers', 'such', 'President', 'Theodore', 'Roosevelt', 'are', 'fetured', 'work', 'fact', 'second', 'episode', 'deals', 'mostly', 'TR', 'tireless', 'efforts', 'get', 'national', 'parks', 'established', 'perhaps', 'favorite', 'episode', 'all.I', 'have', 'seen', 'quite', 'few', 'national', 'parks', 'years', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'fascinated', 'little-known', 'histories', 'location', 'lot', 'histories', 'come', 'alive', 'documentary', 'other', 'part', 'history', 'democracy', 'resonate', 'many', 'interviewees', 'production', 'American', 'Heritage', 'American', 'Patriotism', 'Americans', 'are', 'what', 'episodes', 'viewer', 'enraptured', 'documentary', 'Wow', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'viewers', 'will', 'say', 'watching', 'especially', 'watching', 'Mount', 'Rushmore', 'episode', 'So', 'much', 'untold', 'history', 'alive', 'not', 'history', 'school', 'text', 'books', 'are', '50', 'national', 'parks', '300', 'national', 'historical', 'sites', 'country', 'almost', 'are', 'featured', 'documentary', 'good', 'bad', 'many', 'sites', 'former', 'Japanese', 'internment', 'sites', 'Manzanar', 'former', 'Indian', 'battlefields', 'Little', 'Big', 'Horn', 'other', 'battlesites', 'San', 'Antonio', 'Spanish', 'missions', 'get', 'fame', 'well-produced', 'project', 'Educational', 'emotional', 'awe-inspiring', 'beautiful', 'little', 'wonder', 'anything', 'Burns-Duncan', 'team', 'was', 'not', 'expected', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'episode', 'City', 'Kids', 'National', 'Parks', 'was', 'important', 'set', 'overall', 'documentary', 'true', 'American', 'History', 'groups', 'Americans', 'have', 'played', 'part', 'making', 'parks', 'what', 'are', 'today']",N/A

DEGEORGE,"[154, 172]","Although the series suffers somewhat from repetitiveness occasioned by the need to keep re-orienting viewers as multiple story sequences are interrupted for long periods of time while first one, then another, thread is begun, I am glad that I was patient enough to view the entire collection. If you like Ken Burns's thorough and somewhat laid-back style, you will find it agreeable here as in his other series, even if this is not quite his best effort. One should bear in mind that this is primarily an historical documentary, not a travelogue or guide to the parks.In terms of content, I'd probably give the series four stars; but I was disappointed in the video quality of the new motion-picture footage that Burns's photographers accumulated over six years of hard and dedicated work. I believe that a fundamentally wrong decision was made in the choice of medium. Burns has a love of old-style photography, and the many stunning examples of still photos were a joy to behold. I also agree with him that film is a more pleasing medium than direct-to-video. Unfortunately, it would appear that budget limitations (and perhaps portability considerations as well, as photographers were slogging through wilderness) precluded the use of 35mm film, which would have been ideal. Instead, a decision was made (by whom I have no idea) that 16mm film would be the next best thing. This is the point at which I would have decided to use direct video. Even though it may be a little lacking in warmth compared with film, there is only so much grain that I am willing to put up with in a hi-def production. My consumer-grade HD camcorder makes much clearer and cleaner video than is seen in this series.There are a couple of points to be made in favor of the Blu-ray version, however. First, those who may be basing their purchase decision on what they saw on PBS's HD telecast should know that the Blu-ray disc is somewhat better; the graininess of the 16mm film really messed up the compression algorithms used in the distribution of the telecast.

Watching this series I was reminded of what it means to be American and how we are all touched by and connected to the land that is America. The astounding beauty of Yosemite, the wondrous Yellowstone, the rare and majestic sequoias and redwoods, the astonishing prehistoric landscapes of the Grand Canyon, the coastal beauties of Maine, and the towering Grand Tetons and Rocky Mountains, to name a few, are all photographed with obvious love and admiration. Serene, spiritual, mesmerizing Nature in all its glory is contrasted to the long struggles to save some of the most astonishingly beautiful places in America from the greed and shortsightedness of capitalist investors, developers, tacky free market souvenir stands, price gouging hotels and tour groups, etc.  It was never a given that these glorious beauties of nature would be saved or protected. ""The National Parks"" illuminates the historic struggles to create national parks and national monuments to preserve for future generations. This was the American idea, to set aside large tracts of land and to create of these wonderous places a national park to be enjoyed by all people and not just as a preserve of the wealthy elite. Eventually the idea took hold in the world so that now over 4000 national parks exist outside the United States and around the world.

He's the modern John Muir.  In Thoreau's time, he was already telling people that natural beauty could instill noble thoughts into its beholders, but Ken Burns goes one step further and regards the conservation movement as a religion, for good reasons.

Big difference.*  It is disjointed and fractured in terms of its narration.  It will be following one story, then just drop it to talk about something else.  Then, interrupt some other story to go back to one of the previously interrupted ones.*  It is disjointed and fractured in terms of its timeline.  It will jump forward and backwards by decades, with seemingly no rhyme or reason.*  The vast majority of the music is absolutely dreadful.  The Native American flute, drum, and chant music is great.  But it is rare.  Mostly what you get are terrible guitar themes and rehashed Ken Burn's Civil War themes.*  Images of National Parks are often intermixed with each other.  They will be talking about Yosemite, or Yellowstone, and up will pop an image of Glacier.  Like no one would possibly know about them.*  Photographs and footage are repeated many, many times.  Especially images of Yosemite and Yellowstone.  Within the context of a discussion of a park, you may see the same image of it simply repeated.  McKinley comes to mind.*  In retrospect, I wonder if they even visited some of the National Parks they talk about.  The presentation is loaded with archival footage, stills, and old photographs.  In some cases, they don't even show the primary feature of the park.  Lassen comes to mind.*  The editors seem to have been fond of picking 'Bad' guys and 'Good' guys.  In general, a balanced view of the people involved is not presented.  Wilson, for instance made some horrendous decisions regarding the parks, yet most of the mention of his actions focuses on the good stuff he did.  In discussing Yosemite, much is made of how ranchers and others wanted to graze Yosemite, and how John Muir (the good guy) opposed this.  No mention is made of how John Muir himself took sheep to graze in the Yosemite area for many years.  Yeah, I know.  It was just his job.  He needed to make a living.  But, isn't that everyone's excuse?  I am not putting down the good works here of Muir or Wilson, just pointing out the one-sided depiction.*  Overall, the features of the National Parks are not identified when shown, or are not shown at all.  And in many cases, when they are identified and shown, it is with archival footage, poor images, or repetitive stuff you have seen before.  Maps presented are a roaring joke.  You can see better maps in the inserts of a standard $10 road atlas!Quite frankly, I would not watch this a second time.  I certainly would not pay money for it!

We watched discs 2-6 rented from Netflix, disc 1 is listed in our queue as ""Long Wait"" :-(There is so much to say about the experience of watching this series, I don't know where to begin... I guess I'll say that Ken Burns has done it again! Thanks to him and his crew. And regardless what others claim, Blu-ray is currently the best format for watching this (HD-DVD is long dead, unfortunately, so BD is the best even with BD-Java). BUY IT!!!My utter enjoyment of this series is amplified by my personal experiences. In 1952, my family drove ""across country"" in a '51 Ford Woodie station wagon. We camped in many places (couldn't afford hotels/motels... my dad was a Master Sergeant in the US Marines), but my strongest memories are of Yellowstone NP, Badlands NP, and Mount Rushmore NM. Watching this series brought so much back (and tears to my eyes, even now, thinking how fast a lifetime flies) about that trip, as well as other ""return"" trips to National Parks. One particularly vivid memory was when we were stuck for hours in one of the infamous traffic jams in Yellowstone caused by folks wanting to feed the black bears or wanting to watch folks feeding the black bears. As we sat there, we were all (5 people) watching a family feed several black bears to the left of our car. A (LARGE!) black bear stuck its head into my mom's window and nosed her head... there was quite a ruckus to say the very least, and the fastest upping-windows ever! Man that was cool! I was also a National Park Ranger in the Golden Gate National Recreational Area for two years before I began working for the man.Since 1952,  I've been fortunate enough to travel (and many places camp in) this beautiful world of ours including Canada (NWT, BC, Yukon, Alberta), England, Scotland, France (Ahhh, Paris!), Netherlands, Switzerland (ahhhh, Grindelwald), Austria, Philippines, Hong Kong, Australia... but I've never seen anything to compare with our National Park System.In the past 57-years, I've visited the following parks, many more than one visit: Redwood NP, Great Smokey Mountains NP, Grand Canyon NP, Arches NM, Canyonlands NP, Grand Tetons NP, Rocky Mountains NP, Saguaro NP, Tuzigoot NM, Dinosaur NP, Zion NP, Bryce Canyon NP, Death Valley NP, Lake Mead NRA, Joshua Tree NP, Yosemite NP, Pinacles NM, Lassen Volcanic NP (honeymooned there), Point Reyes NS, Muir Woods NM, Lava Beds NM, all of Washington DC's fabulous places, Oregon Caves NM, Mount Rainier NP, Olympic NP, Craters of the Moon NM & Preserve, Colonial NP, several Civil War Battlefields, Shenandoah NP, Gettysburg NMP, Valley Forge NHP, Ellis Island NM, Statue of Liberty NM, Boston NHP, Robert E.

Terrill ""Jasoninohio""","[7, 8]","This takes a more pointed view on the history of the National Parks, and those who fought for them to be preserved for future generations.  The theme that almost made me jump for the conservation effort in the last disc was the people who pushed to expand areas in Alaska.  How this push to expand the National Parks was met with a lot of local opposition, and how over time, those who once opposed the expansion have seen and understand the wisdom of conservation.  We live in a great country, and have been blessed with people who had the foresight to preserve these natural wonders for future generations to enjoy, and for the most part leave it untouched.  Some of these people spent most of their lives fighting for the conservation effort.  As for the video quality of some of the footage, what did you expect?The video quality is kept exactly the way it was filmed on some of these 16 mm home movies.  That was the evolution of film, and some of the home movies that were shown in this documentary were done with very good taste.  They brought back great memories of past camping trips that I am sure my parents still have somewhere in their basement.  It has that familiar warm feeling.

1259951,A36EW68H08UOCS,B002BO2R4K,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[1, 2]","Ken Burns, America's Documentarian, turns his observational genius to a unique project.  Already hailed for his works ""The Civil War"", ""Baseball"", ""Jazz"", ""Mark Twain"" among others, he had to be coaxed by Dayton Duncan into this project.  Perhaps he, like myself and Thomas Jefferson, initially took the natural wonders of American so for granted that it didn't occur to us to give it special consideration.But this superb series makes us sit up and take notice.  Yes, we've heard about Yosemite and Yellowstone and the Shenandoah Valley and John Muir.  But I confess I had not considered how uniquely American is the very idea of ""National Parks"".  The series makes the point that:1. There isn't a more beautiful continent to be found.2. In other places such as Europe ""beautiful"" places were quickly snapped up by the wealthy and turned into their personal playgrounds.3. In the uniquely democratically developing nation of the United States, it was around the time of the Civil War that the idea was publicly presented to preserve and nurture and make available for every ordinary citizen our wonders of the world.  I did not know that this was a new idea, (I've taken it for granted so all my life) and I did not know that America remains one of the only places where such an idea has ever taken root.We hear about heroes such as John Muir, who came to Yosemite Valley at an absolutely perfect time.  He was stunned by the beauty of a place he recognized as one of the most magnificent manifestations of Creation, and uniquely suited by ability and temperament to learn everything about nature that he could.  His abilities included a genius and instinctive scientific nature, but also a persuasive and poetic ability to catalogue his discoveries and use words to infuse others with his passions.  He could have stayed in the place he loved, but he recognized the importance of making others care about nature as well, so he relocated to the Bay area to write persuasive articles and found the Sierra Club.  Although his geographic specialty was the Sierras, his passion for the outdoors created a national awareness that led to the preservation and formation of all of the National Parks.This series contrasts heroes like Muir with self-serving villains who tried to exploit the wonders of nature for their own financial gain, with input to remind us that for the Native Americans, the notion that the Nationals Parks were ""discovered"" by white men is laughable.  For the Natives, the wonders were never lost.All of these stories are accompanied by jaw-dropping cinematography of frankly some of the most astonishing sights possible.  Gigantic Cascading Falls, Spouting Geysers, Erupting Vocanoes, Enormous Underground Caverns, Giant Redwoods, Glistening Waters and Mammoth Mountains amaze us.  Indigenous flora and fauna are captured in these spectacular surroundings.  Large families of grizzlies stand at the top of waterfalls, catching leaping salmon in their gaping maws.  Majestic Deer carry their ornate headgear across serene meadows.This series is a wonderful marriage of history, story, passion, sight and sound.  It has inspired in me a desire now to see these majestic sights for myself.

1259954,A1RPTVW5VEOSI,B002BO2R4K,Michael J. Edelman,"[19, 27]","Like all Ken Burn documentaries, ""National Parks"" contains hours of gorgeous photography, cameras panning across scenic vistas (or photographs of scenic vistas), all the while inspiring music plays in the background. There's a lot of good historical information, too. The problem with the documentary is that Burns doesn't really know how to tell a story visually. Rather, he strings together interminable scenes of people talking with static images, making his documentaries more like watching a slide show while a series of lecturers come and go.True, he does present some interesting stories, but there's no overall narrative theme, nothing that really drives the story.

But this video series gives you so much more.  Great pictures set to bluegrass and folk music as the history of the national parks is told.  That combination you can't find elsewhere.  It was interesting to see that things haven't changed at all since 1878 when Yellowstone became our first U.S. national park.  People are still the short-sighted fools that they've always been who satisfy their short-term greed instead of planning for long-term benefit.  It's going on all over the country and almost every national park is continually assaulted by artifact stealers (Petrified Forest N.P.), clear cutting right up to the park boundary (Olympic N.P.) and commercial exploitation, e.g., the hideous skywalk that was built at Grand Canyon as well as the ubiquitous helicopter rides over the canyon; and the hundreds of snowmobiles that are allowed in several national parks such as Yellowstone that disturb the wildlife and the people who go there for solace.  Now, the Utah delegation is trying to stop the beautiful Red Rock wilderness in southern Utah from getting permanent federal protection (they've been fighting this battle for  20 years).  They want the resources to be made available to ORV users, oil rigs and loggers and for the burgeoning population that irresponsible over breeders generate.  Nothing has changed.This was all going on over a hundred years ago, but scaled to 19th and early 20th century technology, and that is the most important thing that this video series teaches.  John Muir never took anything for granted and saw the damn built that would flood Yosemite's lovely Hetch Hetchy Valley, the valley that he had spent a lifetime fighting to protect.  Muir thought that President Theodore Roosevelt had protected it for perpetuity, but he found out in his last years that that wasn't so.Buy these DVDs and learn what your children may be missing unless you fight for it.",5,Buy it to see what your children may be missing.,1254700800,"10 5, 2009",2009,2018,"['want', 'just', 'picture', 'book', 'filled', 'great', 'national', 'parks', 'photography', 'then', 'are', 'plenty', 'video', 'series', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Great', 'pictures', 'set', 'bluegrass', 'folk', 'music', 'history', 'national', 'parks', 'told', 'combination', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'elsewhere', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'things', 'have', ""n't"", 'changed', '1878', 'when', 'Yellowstone', 'became', 'first', 'U.S.', 'national', 'park', 'People', 'are', 'still', 'short-sighted', 'fools', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'who', 'satisfy', 'short-term', 'greed', 'instead', 'planning', 'long-term', 'benefit', 'going', 'country', 'almost', 'national', 'park', 'continually', 'assaulted', 'artifact', 'stealers', 'Petrified', 'Forest', 'N.P', 'clear', 'cutting', 'right', 'up', 'park', 'boundary', 'Olympic', 'N.P', 'commercial', 'exploitation', 'e.g.', 'hideous', 'skywalk', 'was', 'built', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'as', 'well', 'ubiquitous', 'helicopter', 'rides', 'canyon', 'hundreds', 'snowmobiles', 'are', 'allowed', 'several', 'national', 'parks', 'such', 'Yellowstone', 'wildlife', 'people', 'who', 'go', 'there', 'solace', 'Now', 'Utah', 'delegation', 'trying', 'stop', 'beautiful', 'Red', 'Rock', 'wilderness', 'southern', 'Utah', 'getting', 'permanent', 'federal', 'protection', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fighting', 'battle', '20', 'years', 'want', 'resources', 'be', 'made', 'available', 'ORV', 'users', 'oil', 'rigs', 'loggers', 'burgeoning', 'population', 'irresponsible', 'breeders', 'generate', 'Nothing', 'changed.This', 'was', 'going', 'hundred', 'years', 'ago', 'scaled', '19th', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'technology', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'video', 'series', 'teaches', 'John', 'Muir', 'never', 'took', 'anything', 'granted', 'saw', 'damn', 'built', 'would', 'flood', 'Yosemite', 'lovely', 'Hetch', 'Hetchy', 'Valley', 'valley', 'had', 'spent', 'lifetime', 'fighting', 'protect', 'Muir', 'thought', 'President', 'Theodore', 'Roosevelt', 'had', 'protected', 'perpetuity', 'found', 'out', 'last', 'years', 'was', ""n't"", 'so.Buy', 'DVDs', 'learn', 'what', 'children', 'may', 'be', 'missing', 'fight']",N/A

1259968,A16QODENBJVUI1,B002BO2R4K,Robert Moore,"[11, 14]","This is a high quality, gorgeous-to-look-at documentary that is nonetheless marred by some stunning omissions.  The show gets many of the key issues correct, though I think it was a bit weak early on in emphasizing just how radical the idea of creating national parks was.  This could have been done by contrasting American views of wilderness with European views, by delving a bit into Romantic ideas of the sublime and the beautiful and contrasting traditional views of natural beauty as land usable by people with wilderness beautiful simply in and or themselves.  The whole series is hurt a bit by the rather thin intellectual context into which it is placed.  I would strongly recommend anyone interested in gaining a deeper understanding of the larger intellectual context read Roderick Nash's great classic WILDERNESS AND THE AMERICAN MIND.  You can't do much better than that.  Nash's book also contains a great bibliographic essay that is almost worth the cost of the book by itself.  The role of Thoreau in America's philosophy of nature cannot be overstated, yet he is almost barely mentioned.  This is typical of the entire series.  The great thinkers that have framed nearly all of our discussions of nature get very little mention.  Granted, this series was not meant to be a history of American thought about nature, but it is nonetheless strange not to hear discussions of the individuals whose writings on nature and parks have had the greatest impact on our country.  John Muir is discussed, of course, at great length, but most of the other great figures are omitted entirely or barely mentioned at all.Examples.  I've mentioned Thoreau.  Building on his early mentor Emerson, Thoreau wrote in enormous detail about valuing nature and wildness in ways that were completely unique in Western civilization.  His writings, from CAPE COD to ""Walking"" to WALDEN to the thousands of pages of his journals have inspired and reinspired nearly every important thinker on nature who came afterwards.  One of the most shocking omissions was Aldo Leopold, for two reasons.  First, Leopold was extremely important in talking of conservation and the use of the forests, helping to establish much of the national policy towards the national forests.  Second, and more importantly, Leopold wrote what is far and away the great classic of the environmental ethics movement, SAND COUNTY ALMANAC, which includes the great classic essay ""Thinking Like a Mountain.""  Nearly as tragic was the complete lack of mention of Edward Abbey and his great work DESERT SOLITAIRE, a book which chronicles his experiences in the two summers he spent working in Arches National Monument (now Park).  Abbey's book is the most famous single work on nature of the past fifty years and possibly of the entire 20th century.  Moreover, he was a student of Wallace Stegner, whose from whose writings the phrase ""America's best idea"" was taken.  Perhaps worst of all there was no mention of the incredibly important role of Bernard DeVoto in the single greatest environmental crisis of the 20th century.  DeVoto was the mentor to Wallace Stegner (who wrote a biography about DeVoto, THE UNEASY CHAIR, which referred to DeVoto's regular Harper's column ""The Easy Chair).  In the early 1950s there was an effort by some in Congress to sell off the vast majority of public land in America.  In essence, just about all public land that was not already a national park would have been sold to private interests.  This was a crisis that completely dwarfed the more famous and notorious effort to build a dam in the Grand Canyon in the potential damage that could have resulted.  DeVoto almost single-handedly waged war against the Congressional plot and saved millions of square miles of public lands by private takeover.  Yet, DeVoto's towering achievement curiously is omitted from most histories of American environmentalism.  Many of the parks created after WW II and most of the extensions of the parks would have been impossible if DeVoto had failed.  There was a single shot in the documentary of the headline of one of DeVoto's essays, but surely he deserved more mention than that.  One of the things that Burns is noted for in his films is rescuing from anonymity deserving and underrated individuals, so that the omission of DeVoto's extraordinary victory is all the more remarkable.  (DeVoto is, by the way, someone whose writings more people need to know.  He was a wonderful prose writer -- I strongly recommend the interested to search out THE LETTERS OF BERNARD DEVOTO, edited by Wallace Stegner, which reveal his personality and passions better than any of his other books -- and wrote some marvelous popular histories -- his widow made a brief appearance in JULIE AND JULIA as the person who put Julia Child in contact with her eventual publisher.)  I find these omissions disappointing in large part because these writers and thinkers have molded the thinking about nature and parks for a vast number of Americans.  We value parks and wilderness and nature in large part because of people like Thoreau, Mary Austin, Henry Beston, Aldo Leopold, Bernard DeVoto, Edward Abbey, and Annie Dillard and it would have been nice to see the role of thinkers stressed as much as park managers and public officials.As a passionate student of the history of American environmentalism and environmental ethics I found this series to be quite disappointing.  While it was weak on the major thinkers, the series still does a decent job of hitting many of the highlights in American history.  There were a host of relatively minor incidents that provide great background and depth to things.  I would have liked to see more about the loss of Glen Canyon, cut by the Green river, which was lost by the building of a dam (the destruction of which provides the heart of Edward Abbey's novel THE MONKEY WRENCH GANG).  And I would have liked to see more about such things like the role of the Hudson River school (Thomas Cole and his cohorts).  In other words, this is a subject I know quite a bit from earlier reading and study (I once seriously contemplated teaching a class on Environmental Ethics) and had I been asked to write the script I would have had some very different emphases.  Too much of the documentary, I believe, focused on secondary and bit players, while too many of the stars of the drama were left out.I will add, however, that many people were included as commentators whose work I know and respect.  I own and have read books by William Cronon, Alred Runte, and Terry Tempest Williams, as well as John Hope Franklin, who is obviously not known primarily as an authority on American environmentalism.  So, I thoroughly enjoyed this series, just as I always enjoy Ken Burns's works, but I feel that it failed in some unexpected ways.  When I first heard about this series, I immediately wondered how they were going to handle Edward Abbey, so it was a bit of a shock when he was not covered at all.  If there had simply been one or two omissions like this I wouldn't have been so disappointed, but to anyone who knows much about the history of American environmentalism, to have almost no Thoreau, no Leopold (except as an inclusion in a single sentence), no DeVoto (except a single photo of one of his articles), and no Abbey was indicative of how much was left out.  I am, however, delighted that Terry Tempest Williams was included as a commentator (I strongly recommend anyone who enjoyed the series to read her REFUGE).  I just wish that so much that was left out hadn't been.",3,Excellent and beautiful despite some stunning omissions,1264291200,"01 24, 2010",2010,7571,"['high', 'quality', 'gorgeous-to-look-at',

This is one of, if not the best, documentaries ever produced by Ken Burns, and is a must see by everyone who can appreciate the symbiotic and sacred relationship between mankind and nature.

In this film, there are stunning pictures and footage that show the beauty of all of our National Parks, their history, people, and the politics that sometimes were involved in getting these parks established. Several people (writers, activists, park rangers, etc.) lend their perspective on what the parks mean to not only them, but to this country as a whole. One such guest in this 12 hour film is Shelton Johnson, who is a park ranger at Yosemite National Park. This man does a great job with his very intellectual perspective on what the parks mean to our history. The manner in which he communicates is heartfelt, and draws the viewer into his sort of allegorical style of communicating. I was mesmerized by how he describes things, and made me appreciate our National Parks more than ever. Ken Burns has a unique ability to bring pictures and images to life, and this coupled with the guests' passion really make this film work. The music intro is folk, and works well as a sort of 'land of the beautiful' soundtrack. I particularly like how each park is explored historically, with no park left out, or other parks getting way more exposure or air time.

While many countries have spectacular places (including some great ones in my home country Australia)the scenes I witnessed in the Ken Burns masterpiece of film making, you are blessed to have had some visionary people to save the areas known as The National Parks. They are truly breath taking sights and the brilliance of Ken Burns to put it all together as a permanent record of those places is truly amazing.I have been fortunate to visit Yosemite, Grand Canyon and Sequoia National parks with my family and found them fascinating, but this documentary has made me want to come back and visit them all and to really experience something truly special. I was literally blown away by the beauty and majesty of these places, and the BluRay only enhanced my viwewing pleasure. I learnt so much from watching this documentary and certainly looked at Teddy Roosevelt in a new and much better light. He and people like John Muir were true visionaries and the pioneers of today's environmental movement. Without them and others, you probably wouldn't have these great National Parks that you now enjoy.It was great to have actual National Parks rangers on the program, as well as noted historians. And I defy anyone not to be touched and moved by the personal experiences of some of these people on disc 6 when they recall their visits to the parks. If you aren't, you surely have a heart of stone.Take the time to buy this documentary, sit down and enjoy some fascinating people and even more spectacular sights. The voice overs are great and the narration of Peter Coyote is moving and passionate.I bought Prohibition earler this year and found that excellent, but I think The National Parks-America's Best Idea will prove to be Ken Burns' greatest project and a true masterpiece. Even if you don't live in America, be prepared to be dazzled by brilliant film making and photography to view places and sights that are truly breath taking, and to be thankful for the people who created these parks for the benefit of all people, not just Americans, to enjoy and marvel at.",5,BRILLIANT!!!!

The only complaints I have revolve around the storytelling, which flits from one topic to another and back again so quickly as to feel almost like a dilettantish fantasia. I understand that this approach may help to keep some people's attention, as no topic lingers too long as to become disinteresting, but I feel it somewhat fractures the narrative. With that said, this film is not so much about a story as it is about pictures.

1259983,AIR5HDNUI9WCU,B002BO2R4K,Wayne J. Anderson,"[5, 6]","""Natureshots"" review says it best. As always, Ken Burns does an excellent job putting this documentary together. We live only 1 1/2 hours away from Glacier Park in the summer, and feel very fortunate to have the park in our back yard. Every American needs to see this video, and learn what treasures have been created in our country. It made me proud of our country to watch this video, and it is difficult for me to understand any negative review. The documentary makes me want to go visit all the national parks I have not seen. It is best to watch in two hour segments, like it was presented on PBS. Yes there is a great deal of history in the documentary, however it is not boring, but fascinating. How fortunate we are as Americans that outstanding people came along at just the right time to help great ideas come to life.",5,Great ideas,1254787200,"10 6, 2009",2009,828,"['Natureshots', 'review', 'best', 'always', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'excellent', 'job', 'putting', 'documentary', 'together', 'live', 'only', '1', '1/2', 'hours', 'away', 'Glacier', 'Park', 'summer', 'feel', 'very', 'fortunate', 'have', 'park', 'back', 'yard', 'Every', 'American', 'needs', 'see', 'video', 'learn', 'what', 'treasures', 'have', 'been', 'created', 'country', 'made', 'proud', 'country', 'watch', 'video', 'difficult', 'understand', 'negative', 'review', 'documentary', 'want', 'go', 'visit', 'national', 'parks', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'best', 'watch', 'two', 'hour', 'segments', 'was', 'presented', 'PBS', 'great', 'deal', 'history', 'documentary', 'however', 'not', 'boring', 'fascinating', 'How', 'fortunate', 'are', 'Americans', 'outstanding', 'people', 'came', 'along', 'just', 'right', 'time', 'help', 'great', 'ideas', 'come', 'life']",N/A

They convinced me that it is unfair to review a series without seeing all the episodes, so I deleted the first review. I have seen all the episodes now and have to admit that Ken Burns has come down firmly in the right place. I can see why the Sierra Club, of which I am a member, has so strongly endorsed this series.I learned a lot about the history of the National Parks, and,yes, I got some beautiful HD shots. I also saw minority viewpoints which were lacking in his last documentary. I appreciate this.Burns has been criticized for showing too many old black and white photos. I understand he does this to get an historical perspective and it is effective but I think he uses this technique too much. Many have criticized the background music he uses. To me, it is distracting, a kind of elevator music. In the last episode he used a short clip of the Mamas and Papas. Why?There are too many interviewed who see God in the NationalParks. This is different from the pantheism of Thoreau or the Native Americans. But I have to admit that we are a religious nation and the documentary reflects this fact.These are minor objections and in the end I must endorse Burns' fighting the good fight against all those commercial interests that have tried to destroy the parks in the past and still are.",4,A Good History of the National Parks,1254096000,"09 28, 2009",2009,1403,"['was', 'one', 'reviewers', 'who', 'gave', 'series', '1', 'star', 'got', '32', 'comments', 'replied', 'convinced', 'unfair', 'review', 'series', 'seeing', 'episodes', 'deleted', 'first', 'review', 'have', 'seen', 'episodes', 'now', 'have', 'admit', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'come', 'down', 'firmly', 'right', 'place', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Sierra', 'Club', 'am', 'member', 'so', 'strongly', 'endorsed', 'series.I', 'learned', 'lot', 'history', 'National', 'Parks', 'yes', 'got', 'beautiful', 'HD', 'shots', 'also', 'saw', 'minority', 'viewpoints', 'were', 'lacking', 'last', 'documentary', 'appreciate', 'this.Burns', 'been', 'criticized', 'showing', 'too', 'many', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'photos', 'understand', 'get', 'historical', 'perspective', 'effective', 'think', 'technique', 'too', 'much', 'Many', 'have', 'criticized', 'background', 'music', 'distracting', 'kind', 'elevator', 'music', 'last', 'episode', 'used', 'short', 'clip', 'Mamas', 'Papas', 'Why', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'interviewed', 'who', 'see', 'God', 'NationalParks', 'different', 'pantheism', 'Thoreau', 'Native', 'Americans', 'have', 'admit', 'are', 'religious', 'nation', 'documentary', 'fact.These', 'are', 'minor', 'objections', 'end', 'must', 'endorse', 'Burns', 'fighting', 'good', 'fight', 'commercial', 'interests', 'have', 'tried', 'destroy', 'parks', 'past', 'still', 'are']",N/A
