1150072,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B0015OKWKI,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[2, 3]","The first thing that struck me while watching `The Visitor' is how much the protagonist reminded me of Dennis Quaid's character in `Smart People'.  Although this movie was made before that one, we have a man who has a striking resemblance.  Walter (Richard Jenkins) is a professor at a Connecticut college.  He is a widower who is taking piano lessons, so that he can learn the same talent his wife was able to create for her C.D.'s.  With his students he's tight-fisted, not giving anyone slack, while he lives his solitary life almost in a catatonic state at home.His life is quickly disheveled when he goes to his New York rental and runs into a foreign couple living in his flat.  Startled to be sure, he learns quickly that Tarek (Haaz Speiman) and Mouna (Hiam Abbass) have been renting his place from Ivan, a mysterious opportunist we never meet.  Tarek is a percussion musician who often plays on street corners or at jazz venues in bars.  Perhaps given the jolt he needs, Walter warmly welcomes them to stay in his place while Tarek gives him bongo lessons and invitations to his concerts.  Eventually, a mutual warmth thaws Walter's life.In a mishap, Tarek uses his subway pass to get past the turnstile, but makes the mistake of letting a ticket-less Walter through, too.  From here the police descend on Tarek and incarcerate him as an illegal alien.  For the rest of the film, Walter makes Tarek's freedom and citizenship the first priority while allowing his professional opportunities to slip past.Tom McCarthy (who directed the wonderful indie film, `The Station Agent') wrote and directed this film, and it is to his credit that the movie has a similar quirkiness to evoke a unique warmth.  While the acting is real-life believable, the dialogue sometimes consists of small talk or lacks spark.  Certainly, there are laudable themes here, but the movie works best when it lets the action do the talking.  Although this is a good indie film, it lacks the impact of other fine immigrant movies where comparisons of recent movies like 'The Namesake' and 'Man Push Cart' quickly come to mind.A J.P.'s Pick 4.0 *'s = Very Good",4,'Bringing It All Back Home',1223683200,"10 11, 2008",2008,2137,"['first', 'thing', 'struck', 'watching', 'Visitor', 'how', 'much', 'protagonist', 'reminded', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'character', 'Smart', 'People', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'one', 'have', 'man', 'who', 'striking', 'resemblance', 'Walter', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'professor', 'Connecticut', 'college', 'widower', 'who', 'taking', 'piano', 'lessons', 'so', 'can', 'learn', 'same', 'talent', 'wife', 'was', 'able', 'create', 'C.D.', 'students', 'tight-fisted', 'not', 'giving', 'anyone', 'slack', 'solitary', 'life', 'almost', 'catatonic', 'state', 'home.His', 'life', 'quickly', 'disheveled', 'when', 'New', 'York', 'rental', 'foreign', 'couple', 'living', 'flat', 'Startled', 'be', 'sure', 'quickly', 'Tarek', 'Haaz', 'Speiman', 'Mouna', 'Hiam', 'Abbass', 'have', 'been', 'renting', 'place', 'Ivan', 'mysterious', 'opportunist', 'never', 'meet', 'Tarek', 'percussion', 'musician', 'who', 'often', 'street', 'corners', 'jazz', 'venues', 'bars', 'Perhaps', 'given', 'jolt', 'Walter', 'warmly', 'stay', 'place', 'Tarek', 'bongo', 'lessons', 'invitations', 'concerts', 'Eventually', 'mutual', 'warmth', 'thaws', 'Walter', 'life.In', 'mishap', 'Tarek', 'subway', 'pass', 'get', 'turnstile', 'mistake', 'letting', 'ticket-less', 'Walter', 'too', 'here', 'police', 'descend', 'Tarek', 'incarcerate', 'illegal', 'alien', 'rest', 'film', 'Walter', 'Tarek', 'freedom', 'citizenship', 'first', 'priority', 'allowing', 'professional', 'opportunities', 'slip', 'past.Tom', 'McCarthy', 'who', 'directed', 'wonderful', 'indie', 'film', 'Station', 'Agent', 'wrote', 'directed', 'film', 'credit', 'movie', 'similar', 'quirkiness', 'evoke', 'unique', 'warmth', 'acting', 'real-life', 'believable', 'dialogue', 'sometimes', 'small', 'talk', 'lacks', 'spark', 'Certainly', 'are', 'laudable', 'themes', 'here', 'movie', 'best', 'when', 'action', 'do', 'talking', 'good', 'indie', 'film', 'impact', 'other', 'fine', 'immigrant', 'movies', 'where', 'comparisons', 'recent', 'movies', ""'The"", 'Namesake', 'Push', 'Cart', 'quickly', 'come', 'mind.A', 'J.P.', 'Pick', '4.0', '*', '=', 'Very', 'Good']",N/A

1150074,AGEIT17HENDIS,B0015OKWKI,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 2]","The quirky little film deals very nicely with the questions of one college professor's mid-life crisis (a not unfamiliar problem to this reviewer and, I am sure, to the reader of this review and the audience for this film) and immigration in America in the post 9/11 world and various cross-cultural, if not multi-cultural concerns. As the story unfolds it seems that our professor craves some musical outlet to stave off those mid-life blues (and, additionally, get over his isolation due to the death of his wife). Presto- on a dreaded and fruitless trip to New York City  as a `sub' presenter at one of those never ending conferences that are central to and bedevil academic life he finds a musical muse, a Palestinian jazz drum aficionado, who also happens to be an illegal immigrant `squatting' in the good professor's apartment with his also illegal girlfriend.Along the way the professor, through a fluke of bad timing inadvertently caused by him, learns the hard way the nature of the immigration problem, its seeming absurdities and its abuses. Hovering in the background is our drummer's deeply concerned mother, a very fetching mother to be sure. The professor and mother form an `alliance' to save her son from the horrors of the deportation process. To no avail and he is deported back to Syria. This deportation to Syria serves as a very useful metaphor concerning the plight of the Palestinian Diaspora and of the continuing non-resolution of the question of a Palestinian homeland.Although, in the end, the only one who gets out with some resolution of his crisis is the professor we will not fault the creators of this film for that but rather the vagaries of the post 9/11 world, one George W. Bush and friends and a certain innate American xenophobia about immigrants- that is after one's own ethnic or racial group has `made' it to and in America. After viewing this film I have also become more confirmed in my belief that those who make it here to old immigrant-formed and built America should have full citizenship rights. Watch this film to see what I mean. Moreover watch this film for the taboo `romance' between the good WASP professor and his muse's sparklingly exotic mother. I am sure that it will drive every cultural and religious fundamentalist on both sides of the divide crazy at the cross-cultural implications.

It is at times captivating, at other times sad, but always compelling.  This film should be seen by a wider audience than the art house market.If ""The Visitor"" does nothing else, it raises to the light the issue of illegal immigration.  In this post 11 September world, the fate of illegal immigrants is much more tenuous.  Indeed, this applies not just in America but the entire western world where newly arrived foreigners are viewed with suspicion.  The fact that immigrants add value and pay taxes is too easily forgotten as we revert to positions of hostile disengagement.""The Visitor"" centres around a detached and bored economics professor from Connecticut who visits Manhattan where he owns an apartment.  Upon arrival, he discovers that the apartment is occupied by a young couple.  The man is from Syria and the woman is from Senegal.  They are initially hostile to one another but within a short time come to trust one another.  Unfortunately, the young man (Tarek) is detained by immigration authorities.  His mother arrives to help him and, as this process takes place, a warmth develops between the professor and the mother.  This is a film where characters develop slowly but their true emotions shine.The plot to ""The Visitor"" is slim.  Rather, it is a character study of very plausible people.  All the main characters are warm and giving people.  If there is a dark side to the film it is in the characters of the various government bureaucrats.  These people are portrayed as clinical and uncaring.  In a subtle way, the film is a critique of modern fears of different people.  Its ending is sad.  It is,nonetheless a terrific film.

1150077,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0015OKWKI,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","There is something universally moving about the drama `The Visitor', which takes the tired `finding yourself' storyline and adds layers of poignancy that one does not often encounter in these films.  It feels awfully delicate, which only raises ones interested level and cements ones adoration.This is a film that will speak to you.The film centers around Professor Walter Vale, a relative shell of a man who has lost all meaning in his life since the passing of his wife.  He tries to find something, anything to stimulate him but he falls short every time.  When asked to attend a conference in New York he finds two illegal aliens living in his apartment.  Instead of putting them out of the street, Walter offers to allow them to live with him while they look for another place to live.  What happens next is a revelation in Walter's life, a rebirth, an awakening as he builds a friendship with this couple that reshapes his very existence.`The Visitor' is a very quite yet very profound film about the inner person we keep locked away.  Walter grows gradually in his understanding of himself and allows the audience to grasp his strengths and weaknesses beautifully.Richard Jenkins needs to be Oscar nominated.Jenkins builds his performance with each passing scene, totally diving into Walter's very being and drawing out for us a layered and raw portrayal of a man who lost everything only to find that he hadn't even truly begun to live yet.  The final scene is heartbreaking and reaffirming at the same time for it cements in us the desire to come to know ourselves and be as true to our being as we can be.The film also uses the controversial ideas behind immigration as a catalyst for the films major emotional revelations.  When Tarek (one of the aliens residing in Walter's apartment) is picked up by immigration and threatened with deportation we can see how this affects not just his family but also Walter, a man who most likely had never considered the unjust side of the system.  It challenges his faith in a system that is supposed to protect, to do what is right.It makes you think.In the end I found this to be one of the best films to be released this year; a truly remarkable story that is as engaging as it is important and one that will make you smile as much as it will make you cry.  There are few films that understand the balance in emotions and know how to craft themselves into something that is a treat for each sense.  `The Visitor' is one of those movies.",5,A film you'll want to visit again and again...,1231718400,"01 12, 2009",2009,2488,"['something', 'universally', 'moving', 'drama', 'Visitor', 'tired', 'finding', 'storyline', 'layers', 'poignancy', 'one', 'not', 'often', 'encounter', 'films', 'awfully', 'delicate', 'only', 'ones', 'interested', 'level', 'cements', 'ones', 'adoration.This', 'film', 'will', 'speak', 'you.The', 'film', 'centers', 'Professor', 'Walter', 'Vale', 'relative', 'shell', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'meaning', 'life', 'passing', 'wife', 'find', 'something', 'anything', 'stimulate', 'short', 'time', 'When', 'asked', 'attend', 'conference', 'New', 'York', 'two', 'illegal', 'aliens', 'living', 'apartment', 'Instead', 'putting', 'street', 'Walter', 'allow', 'live', 'look', 'place', 'live', 'What', 'next', 'revelation', 'Walter', 'life', 'rebirth', 'awakening', 'friendship', 'couple', 'very', 'existence.', 'Visitor', 'very', 'quite', 'yet', 'very', 'profound', 'film', 'inner', 'person', 'keep', 'locked', 'away', 'Walter', 'gradually', 'understanding', 'audience', 'grasp', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'beautifully.Richard', 'Jenkins', 'needs', 'be', 'Oscar', 'nominated.Jenkins', 'performance', 'passing', 'scene', 'totally', 'diving', 'Walter', 'very', 'being', 'drawing', 'out', 'layered', 'raw', 'portrayal', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'everything', 'only', 'find', 'had', ""n't"", 'even', 'truly', 'begun', 'live', 'yet', 'final', 'scene', 'heartbreaking', 'reaffirming', 'same', 'time', 'desire', 'come', 'know', 'be', 'as', 'true', 'being', 'can', 'be.The', 'film', 'also', 'controversial', 'ideas', 'behind', 'immigration', 'catalyst', 'films', 'major', 'emotional', 'revelations', 'When', 'Tarek', 'one', 'aliens', 'residing', 'Walter', 'apartment', 'picked', 'up', 'immigration', 'threatened', 'deportation', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'not', 'just', 'family', 'also', 'Walter', 'man', 'who', 'most', 'likely', 'had', 'never', 'considered', 'unjust', 'side', 'system', 'faith', 'system', 'supposed', 'protect', 'do', 'what', 'right.It', 'think.In', 'end', 'found', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'be', 'released', 'year', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'story', 'as', 'engaging', 'important', 'one', 'will', 'make', 'smile', 'as', 'much', 'will', 'make', 'cry', 'are', 'few', 'films', 'understand', 'balance', 'emotions', 'know', 'how', 'craft', 'something', 'treat', 'sense', 'Visitor', 'one', 'movies']",N/A

It premiered here in Dallas at the AFI Dallas 08 film festival.  We saw seven movies at this rapidly-growing event.  'The Visitor' was by far the standout.McCarthy's previous effort,The Station Agent, was a gem.  'The Visitor' is of the same ilk - small cast, 'little' but powerful story, outstanding script, standout acting.  We saw The Station Agent over two years ago, and I think often about the work turned in by Peter Dinklage, Bobby Cannavale and Patricia Clarkson.Likewise, here there's a trio of wonderful, understated performances here - character actor Richard Jenkins (loved him in David O. Russell'sFlirting With Disaster), Haaz Sleiman (whose smile lights up the screen) and the beautiful Hiam Abbass, whose presence gives me an opportunity for my umpteenth plug of one of my favorite movies,The Syrian Bride.  If Mr. McCarthy has the good sense and taste to put Hiam Abbass in a movie, I suspect he saw it, too.  Ms. Abbass is unforgettable there.Hopefully, McCarthy's new film gets the good audience and wide distribution it deserves in 2008.Oh yeah, since I'm actually supposed to be reviewing the DVD here, let me say that music plays an important part of this film and is a key in Jenkins' character's transformation.

The early scenes of the movie show you Walter's loneliness--he eats alone, lives alone--but there are obvious echoes of happier times in his life.  On a chance visit to NYC he discovers two illegal immigrants that have illegally sublet his apartment.  On a whim, he lets them stay, and they slowly bring him back to life.  Just when the movie starts to cheer up--the unlucky happens--one of the immigrants is arrested.  The rest of the film is heart-wrenching, but well worth the watch.This movie is excellent.  The writing is great, and the acting is understated in a way that feels authentic.  You really empathize with these characters as their world is torn apart.  Although the film has a very negative portrayal of the US Government and US Immigrations, you can understand why the characters are so frustrated with the system.  This is certainly a film that will get you thinking, and after watching it, I understand the praise it has received in the press.I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a real human interest story.

Right off the bat, I felt connected to the main character, Walter Vale, a lonely, widowed professor who's just going through the motions of life--not really engaging in it and passionless about most things.  It's as if he's marking time as quietly and as unobtrusively as he can for there's nothing left to excite or inspire him.  Fortunately, something unforeseen happens that reignites Walter's passion.The ensuing relationship he develops with the young couple, Tarek and Zainab, who mistakenly rent Walter's apartment in New York, resonated with me quite profoundly.  After viewing, a few of us discussed if anyone would really go to the lengths Walter did to help someone else.  I truly believe that there are decent and selfless individuals who would do so.  What's remarkable about this film is how realistic the acting is (most especially that of Richard Jenkins of Six Feet Under fame), the kind where I get the sensation that I'm eavesdropping on real people.  There are political issues at the forefront of the story, but they're neither rammed down your throat nor trotted out for the sake of liberal posturing.

We also get left with many questions about our country and its systems.  The film does not wrap itself up in a pretty bow with a happy ending.  The ending is actually open ended with much food for thought for the viewer.The weight of the movie weighs on the shoulders of Richard Jenkins who portrays Walter, a widowed college professor who lives in the country but also holds an apartment in New York City.  When he visits New York he finds two homeless illigal aliens haven been living in his apartment.  They thought that the apartment had been rented to them and had no idea it was owned by Walter.  All reaction to this situation is very believable and Walter ends up letting the couple stay with him.  He forms a bond with them, especially with Syrian musician Tarek, and seems to find a newfound emotional release through them.  A simple mishap leads to Tarek being arrested by the immigration authorities and he is threatened with deportation.  The story proceeds as his mother comes to New York and stays with Walter.  A special bonds is formed between these two as well.The acting here is superb from the entire cast and through the simple story the viewers heart will be broken and many issues will be raised.  These are not generic characters.  Richard Jenkins gives a slowly simmering emotional performance of perfection and Haaz Sleiman as Tarek matches him scene for scene.  This is a film that raises issues about our countries laws regarding illegal aliens in the country and especially the strict changes made after 9/11.  This is a deep, emotional drama realistically told.  There are no overboard plot twists.  Instead we have what could be a real life situation told through the emotions and actions of the characters.  This film touched me deeply and I had to own it for repeated viewing.  Deep character studies well done are hard to come by.  This one is superb.  I also purchased the blu ray which adds much to the story with its vivid and realistic visual presentation.  Though mostly a dialogue driven movie the sound provided is superb.  I highly recommend this film.

A story of the healing power of music, of the renewal of the spirit, of the loyalty of family and friends, set against a backdrop of an indifferent immigration process...this is truly an exceptional film in every way, and should be at the top of your 'must have' list of films.The cast is very, very good, with Richard Jenkins' Oscar-nominated performance a standout. He plays Prof. Walter Vale, an Economics professor whose existence has been on autopilot since the death of his pianist wife.

While he accepts their apology and promise to leave, he sympathizes with their situation enough to give them a couple of days to move...and when he hears Tarek play an African drum, a bonding based on the unique sound reawakens the dormant spirit of Vale, and a friendship develops that gives his life new meaning....But when Tarek is arrested, and it is revealed that he and Zainab are illegal aliens, Vale's rediscovered humanity will be tested against a system that simply doesn't care...and when he meets Tarek's mother, Mouna (Hiam Abbass, who is simply terrific), he faces a moral dilemma; does he stay on in Manhattan to do what he can to help, or do the 'proper' thing, and return to his mundane existance in Connecticut?The film doesn't gloss over the issues, but deals with them on a personal level, in a completely believable fashion, and the frequent musical moments have a pulsating yet sublime quality that truly demonstrates the transcendental power of music.

1150088,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B0015OKWKI,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[2, 3]","There are so many great qualities about THE VISITOR that it's tough to know where to start. I guess the first thing to mention might be the fact that it's an independent film that got only scattered showings across the States. It plugged away for about 19 weeks at small, indie cineplexes and churned out a surprising $10 million dollars. Chump change for big budget films like theSpider-Man series, but for something that cost around $1 million to make, that's quite a hefty return for an indie. Although dollars don't always add up to successful (or even good) cinema, it does show this film had legs and kept on sprinting along with other big budget summer flicks (it came out in April of 2008). I'd always wondered why it remained so long at my local art theater, but just never got around to seeing it. So when I saw its release on DVD, I swept in and picked up a copy to see what the hubbub was all about.Well, the quiet accolades were definitely deserved. The Visitor ranks up there as one of my favorite films this year. Why? Because it's topical, well-acted (by many unknowns), and filmed in simple measures that allow the story to unfold without smacking the audience in the face with a blatant message.The star of the show is Richard Jenkins, and he's the most familiar face you'll see. Known as the quirky dead dad in theSix Feet Under series, and appearing this year in the Cohen brothers' dark comedy hit Burn After Reading, Jenkins pulls off the role of a lifetime.  Professor Walter Vale (Jenkins) is just going through life's motions. He cares for nothing since his wife passed away, giving boring lectures and repetitive tests to his students. Forced to leave town for New York City in order to give a speech about a book he coauthored (which he didn't coauthor), Walter steps into his small apartment only to find two strangers living there without his knowledge.  Tarek (Haaz Sleiman,24) and his girlfriend Zainab (newcomer Danai Jekesai Gurira) were duped into renting the apartment by a slimy friend, and once Walter arrives they are forced to leave.Tarek is a Syrian while Zainab is a native of Africa and the two seem an odd pairing but are obviously in love. And Tarek's other love, his drums, are what bring him and his girlfriend back into Walter's fold. The thing Walter remembers most about his deceased wife is her love of music, and the opening scene of the film gives us some hidden insights into Walter's need to stay connected to her (he tries to learn the piano but simply isn't very good at it). But Tarek introduces him to his African drum and Walter's mind begins to awaken. They play together in the apartment and in Central Park. Walter shirks everything he thought might be dear to him and follows Tarek around, watching him play at various venues. But then tragedy strikes. In a post 9/11 world, anyone who looks like Tarek is a suspect, so when a mistake at a subway turnstile turns into a legal matter, Walter learns some disturbing news: Tarek and Zainab are illegals. Feeling as if he's losing another piece of himself (similar to the way he felt about losing his wife), Walter comes to their aid, hiring an immigration attorney and trying his best to get Tarek released.The ante gets upped further when Tarek's mother (Hiam Abbass,Paradise Now) arrives and wants to know what's going on with her son (whom she hasn't heard from since his incarceration). Walter breaks the bad news to her, and she and Walter strike up a gradual personal relationship that pulls down many barriers (from political to social).It is a serious credit to this film that it takes on issues of the post 9/11 world and shows us the problems with our overly fearful homeland security system. Tarek is a hard worker, wanting only a fresh start in a country of opportunity, but is given none because of the color of his skin, the lilt of his voice, and the name of his country. Likewise for Zainab. And for Mouna (Tarek's mother).

1150089,AYC3Y4QX7GATV,B0015OKWKI,"Bob Dog ""My Thoughts""","[0, 0]","""The Visitor"" is the kind of film we need everyone to watch at least once.  It could change the world in a matter of hours.  Tom McCarthy has created a piece of art that is at times magnificent, always graceful, and never misses.Most of the movies to which I would give five stars probably have more great vs. not so good moments.  But for ""The ""Visitor,"" I'm still trying unsuccessfully to think of any short sequence, or even a frame that was not outstanding, or failed to add to the story.Not long into ""The Visitor,"" I began to see that each scene had a significant theme, personality, sound, and visual impact.  Many of these scenes could have successfully stood by themselves as shorts.  Taken together as a sequence of wonderful little vignettes, they made for a very emotional experience.As a private person with an academic background, it was very easy for me to imagine myself in the role played brilliantly by Richard Jenkins.  He makes the highly praised acting of Bill Murray in ""Lost in Translation"" look just average.I love the writing, acting and especially the cinematography.  Several times I leaned over to my wife and whispered, ""that was good writing.""  And even now, several days later, I still recall some of the great images in the film, such as the image of that bunker-like immigration jail, or seeing Richard Jenkins through multiple panes of reinforced glass, or behind the criss-crossing subways. Some of the scenes were just incredible - like when the shallow tourist buys the bracelet, or when Tarik's mother lays down with Jenkins (it breaks your heart), or when the immigration clerk asks Jenkins to step away from the glass.  I could go on and on.  These were brilliant moments.Immediately after seeing it for the first time, I decided to experience it again without sound. I don't mean to take anything away from the wonderful score, which was very powerful and important to the film.  But I wanted to watch the images.  Then, I watched it again without looking, just listening to the score, the sounds, and the voices of the actors.  I can tell you, the respective sights and sounds of ""The Visitor"" are so good, that it still succeeds without one or the other.Illegal immigration is a very emotional topic for millions of Americans who will never have any understanding of reality for illegals of today, or illegals of the past (their ancestors?).  I'm sure someone could write a film about illegal aliens who, once they are here, commit crimes or who sit around collecting government benefits. Perhaps in some cases that is true.  But I will end this review as I started it.  If we could somehow get everyone on earth to watch ""The Visitor,"" we would all benefit from the experience of understanding a little reality about someone who is different than ourselves, and make this a better place to live, wherever we live.",5,Beautiful Film About Humanity,1225065600,"10 27, 2008",2008,2857,"['Visitor', 'kind', 'film', 'need', 'everyone', 'watch', 'least', 'once', 'could', 'change', 'world', 'matter', 'hours', 'Tom', 'McCarthy', 'created', 'piece', 'art', 'times', 'magnificent', 'always', 'graceful', 'never', 'misses.Most', 'movies', 'would', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'probably', 'have', 'more', 'great', 'vs.', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'moments', 'Visitor', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'unsuccessfully', 'think', 'short', 'sequence', 'even', 'frame', 'was', 'not', 'outstanding', 'failed', 'add', 'story.Not', 'long', 'Visitor', 'began', 'see', 'scene', 'had', 'significant', 'theme', 'personality', 'sound', 'visual', 'impact', 'Many', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'successfully', 'stood', 'shorts', 'Taken', 'together', 'sequence', 'wonderful', 'little', 'vignettes', 'made', 'very', 'emotional', 'experience.As', 'private', 'person', 'academic', 'background', 'was', 'very', 'easy', 'imagine', 'role', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'highly', 'praised', 'acting', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'look', 'just', 'average.I', 'love', 'writing', 'acting', 'especially', 'cinematography', 'Several', 'times', 'leaned', 'wife', 'whispered', 'was', 'good', 'writing', 'even', 'now', 'several', 'days', 'later', 'still', 'recall', 'great', 'images', 'film', 'such', 'image', 'bunker-like', 'immigration', 'jail', 'seeing', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'multiple', 'panes', 'reinforced', 'glass', 'criss-crossing', 'subways', 'scenes', 'were', 'just', 'incredible', 'when', 'shallow', 'tourist', 'bracelet', 'when', 'Tarik', 'mother', 'down', 'Jenkins', 'heart', 'when', 'immigration', 'clerk', 'Jenkins', 'step', 'away', 'glass', 'could', 'go', 'were', 'brilliant', 'moments.Immediately', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'decided', 'experience', 'again', 'sound', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'wonderful', 'score', 'was', 'very', 'powerful', 'important', 'film', 'wanted', 'watch', 'images', 'Then', 'watched', 'again', 'looking', 'just', 'listening', 'score', 'sounds', 'voices', 'actors', 'can', 'tell', 'respective', 'sights', 'sounds', 'Visitor', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'still', 'one', 'other.Illegal', 'immigration', 'very', 'emotional', 'topic', 'millions', 'Americans', 'who', 'will', 'never', 'have', 'understanding', 'reality', 'illegals', 'today', 'illegals', 'past', 'ancestors', ""'m"", 'sure', 'someone', 'could', 'write', 'film', 'illegal', 'aliens', 'who', 'once', 'are', 'here', 'commit', 'crimes', 'who', 'sit', 'collecting', 'government', 'benefits', 'Perhaps', 'cases', 'true', 'will', 'end', 'review', 'started', 'could', 'somehow', 'get', 'everyone', 'earth', 'watch', 'Visitor', 'would', 'benefit', 'experience', 'understanding', 'little', 'reality', 'someone', 'who', 'different', 'make', 'better', 'place', 'live', 'live']",N/A

Erland,"[0, 0]","The '08 release `The Visitor' is a thoughtful, poignant reflection on Post 9/11 America and its impact on those who would wish to immigrate to this country. Richard Jenkins is superb as Walter, a university professor from Connecticut who has drifted into a deep melancholy since the death of his wife. Walter is sent to New York to present a paper at an academic conference and while he's there befriends two illegal immigrants, Tarek (Haaz Sleiman) a Syrian and his Senegalese girlfriend Zainab (Danal Gurira).Walter is invigorated by his friendship with Tarek and begins playing the drum under Tarek's skilled instruction. However it's more than the three beat rhythm of the third world that Walter is becoming immersed in. When his Syrian is arrested by immigration and faced with imminent deportation Walter learns first hand the struggle and heartache of families and individuals seeking a new life in the U.S.A.I have only praise for this film; production values, storyline, music and most of all a terrific cast which includes one of my favorite actresses Haim Abbass in the role of Mouna, Tarek's mother.

He goes to stay at his Greenwich Village apartment while attending an academic conference. But is shocked to discovered a Syrian guy, Tarek, and his Senegalese girlfriend, Zainab, living there. The two had been conned into moving in by a scammer. Yet, instead of kicking them out onto the street, Walter invites them to stay. Tarek helps lift Walter out of his stagnation by teaching him how to play drums. But, while returning from playing in a drum circle, Tarek is picked up by the subway police on a phony charge and taken to a detention center for illegal immigrants. Tarek's mother, Mouna, comes from Michigan and the latter half of the film involves Walter and Mouna trying to get Tarek released.The film's greatest success is in its well crafted depiction of illegal Muslim immigrants as real people rather than negative caricatures. Another important theme is how these guests, and the creative act of drumming, help Walter re-discover the ""rhythm of life"". The acting, direction and script are all outstanding. I should mention, however, that this film is rather slow paced, especially in its middle section. Fans of ""serious cinema"" probably won't mind. But I think a film about finding the ""rhythm of life"" could have used a little more energy. Also this would have perhaps helped it to reach a wider audience. This is something I think is important because the film's humanistic consideration of the plight of illegal immigrants is something a large number of people need to see rather than this being just another ""art film"" preaching to the converted.Still this a very fine movie and I would encourage everyone to see it.",4,Illegal Immigrants Depicted As Human Beings Rather Than Stereotypes,1212192000,"05 31, 2008",2008,1766,"['Walther', 'Vale', 'economics', 'professor', 'who', 'become', 'bored', 'job', 'mired', 'loneliness', 'following', 'death', 'wife', 'stay', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'apartment', 'attending', 'academic', 'conference', 'shocked', 'discovered', 'Syrian', 'guy', 'Tarek', 'Senegalese', 'girlfriend', 'Zainab', 'living', 'there', 'two', 'had', 'been', 'conned', 'moving', 'scammer', 'instead', 'kicking', 'out', 'street', 'Walter', 'stay', 'Tarek', 'lift', 'Walter', 'stagnation', 'teaching', 'how', 'play', 'drums', 'returning', 'playing', 'drum', 'circle', 'Tarek', 'picked', 'up', 'subway', 'police', 'phony', 'charge', 'taken', 'detention', 'center', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'Tarek', 'mother', 'Mouna', 'Michigan', 'latter', 'half', 'film', 'Walter', 'Mouna', 'trying', 'get', 'Tarek', 'released.The', 'film', 'greatest', 'success', 'well', 'crafted', 'depiction', 'illegal', 'Muslim', 'immigrants', 'real', 'people', 'rather', 'negative', 'caricatures', 'important', 'theme', 'how', 'guests', 'creative', 'act', 'drumming', 'help', 'Walter', 're-discover', 'rhythm', 'life', 'acting', 'direction', 'script', 'are', 'outstanding', 'should', 'mention', 'however', 'film', 'rather', 'slow', 'paced', 'especially', 'middle', 'section', 'Fans', 'serious', 'cinema', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mind', 'think', 'film', 'finding', 'rhythm', 'life', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'little', 'more', 'energy', 'Also', 'would', 'have', 'perhaps', 'helped', 'reach', 'wider', 'audience', 'something', 'think', 'important', 'film', 'humanistic', 'consideration', 'plight', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'something', 'large', 'number', 'people', 'need', 'see', 'rather', 'being', 'just', 'art', 'film', 'preaching', 'converted.Still', 'very', 'fine', 'movie', 'would', 'encourage', 'everyone', 'see']",N/A

It causes very strong feelings regardless your residence status...If you are a native you will definitely see under a different light all the foreigners surrounding you and sometimes annoy you or they do not make sense to you.  If you are an immigrant you will feel so much compassion for Tarek. Now if you happen to be illegal in this country (or as a matter of fact in any country) you will get a knot in your stomach.Another interesting aspect of the movie is the culture differences between Tarek who is a man from the Middle East (Syria) and his girlfriend who is from West Africa (Senegal). And finally you see Walter a New Yorker who is an observer of this relationship. At times he feels awkward or sometimes he makes hilarious comments. It is also great to see how two different persons can come so close to each other.

He's calling it in at work, recycling the syllabus of the undergraduate econ course he teaches by changing the year using correction fluid.  He's written three books and pretends to be working on a fourth. He and his classical pianist wife were successful enough to have kept their spacious (by NYC standards) apartment in New York when they moved to Connecticut to be closer to his job. There was probably an unspoken assumption between them that he would be the first to go. His wife's passing left Walter forlorn; every so often he tries to re-connect to his life with her by taking piano lessons, but he was not destined to play the piano.Because he took a co-author credit on a paper he barely even read, he gets stuck having to go into New York to attend a conference and deliver the paper. When he arrives at his long-unused apartment, he discovers it has been fraudulently sub-let to an immigrant couple. The rest of the plot is well-documented elsewhere.What sets this film apart and make it worth seeing it Richard Jenkins' award-winning performance as Walter. A lessor actor might have been tempted to lean toward the maudlin to make Walter more ""likable"" to audiences. American audiences in particular like their emotions Big on the screen. Jenkins internalizes Walter's personal pain and professional boredom and then lets it show through in Walter's appearance and expressions  of indifference and ennui. Jenkins has already won several awards for this role and has been nominated for several more, including an Academy Award. He deserves, even in this year's strong field in the best actor category, everything he wins.I'm taking a star off because in a film where all the characters are so very atypical, the law-enforcement portrayals cross over into stereotype.

1150103,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B0015OKWKI,D. Hartley,"[1, 2]","If Richard Jenkins doesn't get an Oscar nod for his amazing performance in Thomas McCarthy's new comedy-drama, The Visitor, I will personally picket the Academy. Writer-director-actor McCarthy's previous effort was the critical favorite The Station Agent, and once again he draws us into an extended family of very believable, warm-blooded characters, generously giving all of his actors plenty of room to breathe.Jenkins absolutely inhabits the character of the life-tired, middle-aged widower Walter Vale. He is a Connecticut college professor leading a life of quiet desperation; he sleepwalks through his dreary workday, and it's obvious that any inspirational spark is long gone from an unwavering lesson plan that is more aged than his students. His personal life has become rote as well; most of his leisure time is spent puttering, and half-heartedly plunking away on his late wife's piano. In the film's wonderfully played opening scene, Walter fires his private piano teacher, who turns out to be the fourth in a row that he has dismissed. As a parting shot, she suggests that if he should decide that mastering the keyboard is just not his forte, especially ""at his age"", she would be most interested in buying his ""wife's"" piano (ouch). Clearly, Walter needs to get out more.When Walter travels to New York to attend a conference and present a paper, he has a big surprise awaiting him at the seldom-used apartment he keeps in the city. Unbeknownst to the professor, a mysterious third party has sublet his digs to an immigrant couple-a Syrian musician named Tarek (Haaz Sleiman) and his Senegalese girlfriend, Zainab (Danai Gurira). After some tense moments between the mutually startled parties, the forlorn Walter invites them to stay rather than turning them out on the street. As a friendship slowly grows between the three, Walter begins to emerge from his cocoon, prompted by Tarek's infectious enthusiasm for pounding out joyful rhythms on his African djembes. Before he knows it, the staid professor is loosening his tie and joining Tarek in a drum circle at a public park. When Tarek is arrested by undercover cops in the subway due to a misunderstanding and ends up at a detention center for illegal immigrants, Walter hires a lawyer and becomes even more ensconced in the couple's lives. Add one more unexpected ""visitor"" to the mix-Tarek's widowed mother Mouna (the lovely and stately Israeli actress Hiam Abbass) who has traveled from Detroit to investigate why her son hasn't contacted her for an alarming period of time. Now, all the elements of a ""perfect storm"" are in place for the reawakening of Walter Vale.Thanks to Jenkins' subtle, quietly compelling performance, that transformation is the heart of the film, and an absolute joy to behold. Although he has over 70 films to his credit (mostly supporting roles, but always memorable), he is probably most recognizable for his portrayal of the ""late"" father in HBO's popular series, Six Feet Under. Hiam Abbass is a revelation here as well; she and Jenkins play off each other in sublime fashion in all of their scenes together.  In fact, no one in the cast hits a false note, ever. This is undoubtedly due in large part to the fact that McCarthy is an ""actor's director"" in the literal sense; he remains active in tackling roles himself (most recently appearing in  HBO's final season of The Wire as a newspaper journalist who manufactures his stories).The ""strange bedfellows"" setup of the plot may look like The Goodbye Girl or The Odd Couple on paper, but this not a glib Neil Simon play, where characters throw perfectly timed zingers at each other; these people feel, and interact, like real human beings. There is plenty of humor, but there is also genuine heartbreak and bittersweet melancholy. The important thing is that it is all perfectly balanced, and beautifully nuanced.Although the circumstances leading up to Tarek's unfortunate detention could be viewed as an allusion to the sometimes Kafkaesque scenarios faced by illegal immigrants in a post 9-11 world, McCarthy doesn't get preachy on this particular issue or use his film as a polemic.One thing I will say-if the overwrought and vastly overrated Crash (2005) could win Best Picture, then surely The Visitor, which deals with many of the same themes, and in a less histrionic and more palatable manner, deserves consideration as well (we shall see).

These characters were united through a sad random occurence and the film unfolds in a subtle, and sad manner. The ""visitor"" is played by all characters in turn; there are many references which turn ""home"" and ""accomplishment"" on its head.Instead of a black and white debate, where immigrants in the US illegally are condemned and shunned, the film charactgerizes their lives in the US, as real people, and the reasons these characters take turns ""visiting"" their own lives (going back to Syria, how one experiences his/her true roots), and how the characters share commonality regardless of their origins. Most significantly for me, was the fact that it depicts a character that is here in the US legitimately, and still doesn't feel like he ""belongs"" and has control over his own life, struggling with a monotonous existence, and having abandoned his passions, and another character who is very passionate, and for whom music is his main artery. Lastly it flips the stereotype of what kind of people play music in subway stations and parks, on its head.

1150107,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B0015OKWKI,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[0, 1]","This is a fine arthouse film about a quiet, isolated man who finds strength and a new voice when he finally discovers how to connect with others. Walter Vale is a burnt-out, widowed college professor whose specialty -- which he's long since bored with -- is the globalization of the economy. Real-life globalization enters his life when he visits his semi-abandoned New York apartment and finds two people -- both illegal aliens -- living there. They aren't quite squatters, since a ""friend"" told them they were subletting the flat, but no one is as surprised as Walter to find them there. Breaking out of his closed-down routine, Walter allows them to stay, and an unlikely friendship emerges. Walter, who had been trying to learn to play piano, in homage to his deceased wife, now finds himself drawn to African drumming, and gains an able tutor in Tarek, a charming, affable Syrian refugee who is one of the two squatters.  As the film settles into a potentially cliched can-the-white-guy-find-his-groove story arc, disaster hits and Tarek runs afoul of Homeland Security and the INS, and the movie becomes a subtle political advocacy film. What saves it from tedium or cliche are the small emotional moments that fill each frame -- this is a quiet story about the power that simple decency and humanity can add to our lives, especially in the face of implacable social and historical pressures. It's a nice, thoughtful film, worth checking out!

Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[3, 4]","In ""The Visitor,"" written and directed by Tom McCarthy, Richard Jenkins brilliantly portrays Professor Walter Vale, an economics teacher who, for years, has been going through the motions of living.  He is intensely isolated, bored with his job, and has forgotten how to interact with others.  When he visits New York to deliver a paper, he is shocked to find a Syrian man, Tarek, and a woman from Senegal, Zainab, living in the place he owns.  It seems that the couple was conned into renting Vale's East Village apartment in his absence.  Instead of calling the police, however, Walter has compassion for the pair and allows them to stay.  As time passes, his life becomes intertwined with theirs.McCarthy's intelligent and sensitive script is enhanced by Jan Kaczmarek's evocative score, Oliver Bokelberg's atmospheric cinematography, and Tom McArdle's seamless editing.  The entire cast turns in amazing performances.  Each actor delivers his lines with pitch-perfect timing and intonation, using facial expressions and body language to express what words cannot.  It is not surprising that Richard Jenkins was nominated for an Academy Award for his touching depiction of a man living in a bubble of his own making.  Haaz Sleiman, in contrast, is anything but introverted.  He is bursting with self-confidence and cheerful insouciance.  The young man is a musician who plays the drums with such joy that Walter finds himself taking lessons from him and having fun for the first time in years.  Danai Gurira is Tarek's girlfriend, Zainab, a proper and dignified woman who loves Tarek, but is justifiably worried about their future.  When Tarek gets into serious trouble, his mother, Mouna, brought to life by the luminous Hiam Abbass, rushes from Michigan to lend support her son. Walter is instantly smitten with this sweet and lovely lady, and decides to do whatever he can to help this family stay together.The director and his crew shot both in Los Angeles and New York.  The scenes in the subway and on the streets of Manhattan and Queens capture the city's bustle, rhythm, and multi-ethnic charm.  ""The Visitor"" explores universal themes with exquisite subtlety and not a hint of sentimentality or melodrama.  This film makes us question whether America is still a welcoming place for the ""huddled masses yearning to breathe free.""  To McCarthy's credit, he allows his story to unfold naturally  instead of resorting to clich&eacute;s and pat conclusions.

1150111,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0015OKWKI,Ed Uyeshima,"[42, 47]","A genuinely unexpected gem. As he proved with his first film as a director and screenwriter, 2003'sThe Station Agent, Thomas McCarthy knows how to convey the fine line between solitude and loneliness in his characters' lives with an emotional preciseness that doesn't call attention to itself. It's not surprising that McCarthy is an actor because he's able to capture the very subtle nuances in behavior in actors that make his work feel like Edward Hopper paintings come to life. As a result, you pay attention to a simple gesture, a passing glance, a resigned sigh. This time, his protagonist is Walter Vale, an enervated, middle-aged economics professor at a Connecticut college. Widowed and wholly lacking in professional motivation, he begrudgingly accepts an assignment to go to an academic conference at NYU and present a paper on globalization he really didn't write.Coming back to a Greenwich Village flat he rarely uses, he is surprised to find a couple living there. Not squatters but unfortunate victims of a rental scam, they turn out to be illegal aliens, a Syrian percussionist named Tarek and his girlfriend Zainab, a Senegalese who makes and sells handcrafted jewelry. As withdrawn from life as Walter is, he slowly finds himself bonding with the couple and lets them stay indefinitely. Zainab is slow to trust Walter, but Tarek and Walter become close over a mutual love of African drums. As his wife was a famous classical pianist, Walter had been futilely attempting to find musical inspiration since her death. However, just as this charming tale of world harmony plays out, it comes back to harsh reality when Tarek is arrested and taken to a detention center in Queens for deportation. What McCarthy does from this point forward is show how sadly restrictive the post-9/11 environment has made immigration laws and how there is no recourse to be found under the constant surveillance of a bureaucratic government protected by the latitude of the Patriot Act.None of this is hit over our heads with a politically motivated sledgehammer. Far from such polemics, the story singularly focuses on Walter's emergence of purpose in helping Tarek. When Tarek's mother Mouna arrives from Detroit, McCarthy adeptly shows how Walter's closeness to Tarek translates without condition to her. It's a moving transformation of a formerly lonely man finding intimacy in the most unlikely situation. In a once-in-a-lifetime role, character actor Richard Jenkins brings heart and soul to Walter in the most economical manner. Best known as the ghostly father in HBO'sSix Feet Under, he has worked steadily in films for three decades, his most memorable turn being the gay FBI agent high on heroin in David O. Russell'sFlirting With Disaster. With his constant look of resignation on the verge of revelation, Jenkins gives a wondrously poignant, often dryly funny performance that deepens as the story evolves.Haaz Sleiman and Danai Gurira are terrifically winning as Tarek and Zainab, and they make their bonding with Walter more than credible. As Mouna, Hiam Abbass is no stranger to persevering maternal roles as she brought her particular brand of strength to Hany-Abu Assad's controversialParadise Nowand Eran Riklis' family dramedy,The Syrian Bride. In response to Walter's fumbling overtures, she affectingly conveys her character's resolute stillness and gradual blossoming. There are brief cameos by comic actor Richard Kind as Walter's unctuous neighbor, Deborah Rush as a wealthy and ignorant customer of Zainab's, and Broadway legend Marian Seldes as Walter's failed piano teacher. At first, I thought the film's title was blandly generic in describing those who are here from other lands, but I realize now that the visitor is really Walter as he discovers his soul. The last shot is memorable and captures the fury of his passion with potent force.

Walter owns an unassuming apartment in one of the boroughs. He finds out that his apartment has been leased illegally to a couple, who is living in the U.S. illegally. The young man (Sleiman), who is from Syria and a young woman (Jekesai), who is from Senegal have no place to live, and Walter decides to let them stay with him. Walter learns the djembe from Sleiman.While Walter embodies what is right about America, he gets entangled by the drama of what maybe is wrong: how must America deal with illegal immigrants?

1150114,A2GA2SO3YK6CXI,B0015OKWKI,"Esperanza Reynolds ""Hope Reynolds""","[1, 2]","The Visitor is an excellent film. Richard Jenkins plays Walter, a widower that is attempting to fill the void his beautiful classical music piano player wife has left in his life.Walter is a loner, a quiet and introspective man with a heart of gold, who is pondering the meaning of life as he confronts brutal loneliness. The movie starts with him taking piano lessons from a teacher who tries to teach him as if he were a child, without understanding the desperate need Walter has for connection to a lost love through musical notes, so he dismisses her and we see in his eyes the detachment he experiences because nothing that surrounds him is important anymore.Walter is asked to travel to New York City to deliver a paper presentation on a book he did not even write, he simply co-authored it at the request of the real writer. Reluctantly, he accepts and arrives at his NYC apartment, where he has not visited for quite sometime, to find it occupied by total strangers, renting from a person he does not even know. Little does Walter know that these people are about to change his life, to turn his world around, to inspire him with purpose, to produce in him all the emotions he is longing to again experience: love, joy, laughter, pain, anger, tears and the exhilarating knowledge of how to play drums.As he helps others, Walter is simply helping himself to regain a purpose in life, to transform into being alive again, and to rediscover that he is capable of deep passions.

He very reluctantly complies, only to find himself jarred out of his complacent misery when he arrives in New York by finding squatters in the apartment he has maintained for many years. The pair, a Senegalese woman (Danai Gurira) and her Syrian boyfriend (Haaz Sleiman),both illegal aliens, have sublet the apartment from a total stranger.  Walter's reaction, after a great deal of thought, is to take them in until they can find suitable lodgings.  The movie progresses deceptively slowly...you imagine more time has passed than actually happens...and the relationship between the three evolves naturally and believeably. Tarek, the man from Syria, takes an instant liking to his benefactor and when Walter exhibits an interest in Tarek's talent (playing the djembe, an African drum), Tarek turns Walter into the most incongruous member of a drum circle in Central Park. Only Zaineb, the Senegalese woman, shows real wariness; she's been involved in troubles to do with immigration before, and she doesn't totally trust Walter for a long time, until circumstances force her to admit that Walter has a true friendship for both of his impromptu lodgers.

I certainly didn't foresee that there'd be seventy five-star reviews already posted, including several insightfuls, like the one by Rebecca Kyle.This is a film with two endings. The end of the story of Tarek and his mother, the Palestinians, is a tragedy and a shocking revelation of the callous mistreatment of today's ""huddled masses yearning to breathe free."" The end of the story of Walter, the clinically depressed and burned-out professor of economics, is a human triumph, a resurrection of the individual by way of empathy with a stranger. This dual outcome is what makes the film subtle and touching.One of the one-star reviews already posted, by a gent from Pennsylvania, declares that the film had only one virtue, that it ended with the deportation of those vile illegal immigrants, and that the film has a 'political agenda.'

Richard Jenkins played the role superbly, convincingly disinterested in his life, yet something in him is stirring, yearning for something different.You sense that longing in him throughout the movie. I think it was best manifested in the scene in Central Park with his reluctance to join the drummers, but he eventually gives in to his yearning and joins the group.  Well acted.  Lovely scene.  Those instances like that, pushing his character further and further out of his shell, becomes more apparent throughout the film.In the beginning his character was bored with his old life, disinterested but still obliging, simply going through the motions.  Towards the end of the movie, he out and out avoids everything to do with his old life and wholeheartedly embraces his new one with his new friends.

1150123,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0015OKWKI,Grady Harp,"[17, 23]","Just when it seems that film makers have sold out to the idea of blockbuster instant wealth, along comes the very quiet little film THE VISITOR, reassuring us that quality independent films are alive and well.  Written and directed by actor Thomas McCarthy, whose only previous film in the role of writer/director was the incomparable THE STATION AGENT, this subdued little miracle of a film further examines the concept of isolated man searching for connection.  The impact of this simple story of friendship and bonding stays with the viewer, permanently imprinted on our view of the global community.Professor Walter Vale (Richard Jennings in a career making role) is an older man, widowed and greatly diminished by the death of his opera singer wife, bored with teaching the same class on Economics at Connecticut College for years while writing yet another book that holds no interest for him - a lonely, embittered man longing for some meaning in his life, trying to learn piano from an older teacher Barbara (Marion Seldes) without much success.  His college sends him to New York to 'read' a paper he supposedly 'co-wrote' with a colleague and he reluctantly goes to the city for the 'task': he owns an apartment there that he uses only occasionally. Upon arrival he finds a young, terrified couple living in his apartment - two illegal immigrants, Tarek (Haaz Sleiman) from Syria and his girlfriend  Zainab (Danai Jekesai Gurira) from Senegal.  At first shocked by the couple, Walter soon feels their insecurities and invites them to stay.  Tarek has been in America for three years, living in  Michigan with his mother Mouna (Hiam Abbass), and has only been in New York a short while, following his dream to play drums and to be with his jewelry-making lover Zainab.Over time Walter begins to absorb the joy of living Tarek displays while he is drumming and Tarek teaches Walter the art of the drum. Together they perform in parks while Zainab sells her jewelry in the streets.  A minor incident in the subway results in Tarek's arrest and because his is an illegal immigrant, he is placed in a Detention Center in Queens.  Walter is shocked at the cruelty of the police action, remains supportive to the devastated Zainab, and visits the distraught Tarek daily in the Detention Center, finding a lawyer to help the case and in every way being supportive of his new friend.Mouna arrives form Michigan to see why her son has stopped calling her and Walter and Mouna become close out of mutual concern and love for Tarek and his depressing situation.  Though they try to recover Tarek from detention, the 'methods and rules' of the government are against their efforts. The film ends with a sigh, not trying to resolve the insoluble problems of immigrant detention in this country, but instead focusing on the impact these four very beautiful people have made on each other.McCarthy's concept and writing and direction are understated and all the more strong in the final impact of the film because of that approach.  Each of the four main characters is outstanding: Jennings gives an Oscar worthy performance, the new face of Haaz Sleiman is a revelation, and the beautifully nuanced acting of Abbass and Gurira suggest strong careers in the making. The musical score by Jan A.P. Kaczmarek  greatly enhances the film. This is a magically tender and beautifully sensitive film and deserves the attention of all who care about the global village and about the importance of independent filmmaking.

1150129,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B0015OKWKI,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 2]","An interesting film about the very negative and inhumane consequences of the security policy that followed 9/11, though it was present already before. I got one of these famous letters giving you two weeks to leave the USA when I was in North Carolina, though I had been on a wrong visa for nine months and the immigration services knew about it and just tolerated it because I had to fulfill a contract that had been signed and the fault was that of a dumb bureaucrat in the US consulate in Bordeaux. 9/11 only increased the tension and made that policy a lot more systematic. But it is totally false to believe that this security policy is only trying to identify the illegal immigrants in the USA. The real aim is not to terrorize them (which it does of course), it is to really terrorize the potential illegal immigrants by treating those they catch like absolute manure: maybe like that a good proportion of them will not even envisage the trip. The point is not to control the flow but to keep it within reasonable limits because the millions of illegal immigrants are indispensable for the economy to go on working and be competitive. At the same time that enables labor costs to be brought down, hence to keep some rather high salaries at the top because at the bottom they are paid worse than slaves would be. At the same time the problem is a lot more complex than that. It is obvious that immigration would not be a problem if all countries in the world had the same chances to develop, which is not the case, and by developing I mean improve their lots at once economically, politically and culturally, if not psychologically and spiritually. What I consider the worst part of it is that these immigrants come into developed countries with the consumption requirements of their original living standards, just slightly improved, and thus they are able to live rather happily with very little, a lot lower than a fair proportion of us. The film is all the more interesting because it reveals that these immigrants are bringing in talents and qualifications that have little to do with the share of gross national product that enables them to live on the dream that they think is realized, though it is as precarious as precarious can be, like a sand castle on the tide line. In that particularly case it is music. In that particular case it also enables the university professor from Connecticut to admit that he is a pretender who is doing nothing in his life, teaching the same course he has been teaching for 25 years, writing books that are more or less nothing but patient pollen gathering that does not go beyond that and never reaches the level of honey, not to speak of royal jelly. But the end of the film is totally off the point. He has learned nothing after all, playing his drum in the Broadway-Lafayette Street subway station, when he should be playing in Central Park with all the other drum players because that's what this contact should have led him to: sharing and enjoying with fellow-travelers in life the passion they have in common. He has not come out of his solitude or pretence: he has just learned to live his solitude in public.

He achieves little satisfaction as an economics professor in Connecticut; he feels he is merely passing time in his routine existence.  His boss asks him to present a paper at a conference at NYU.  Vale, who is wealthy, maintains an apartment in New York City.  Soon after opening the door, he learns that two illegal immigrants (Tarek and Zainab) have been deceived into renting this apartment from their friend Omar.  Instead of throwing them out, Vale is sympathetic towards their plight and allows them to continue living there.Tarek (Haaz Sleiman) and Zainab (Danai Gurira) are an adorable, Bohemian couple; Tarek, a Syrian, plays a Djembe (pronounced JEM-bay) at local night clubs while Zainab, a West African from Senegal, sells beautiful handmade jewelry.  They are visitors to America.  Unfortunately, they live in constant fear of being deported.  Walter grows closer to his new roommates until he leaves his aristocratic, privileged world and becomes a visitor in their world.  As the days pass, the friends share much joy and sorrow.  Vale eventually turns his back on his own world as he grows determined to help Tarek and Zainab in their own.  When Tarek's charming mom Mouna (Hiam Abbass) visits, it becomes apparent that Walter may never go back to his former lifestyle.  He is falling in love with her.""The Visitor"" is designed to make the viewer feel more sympathetic towards illegal immigrants who are arrested and held in detention centers before being deported.  This is made evident by the insert inside the DVD case which gives frightening statistics concerning the number of immigrants detained in the U.S., the number who have died in detention facilities, etc.  There is also provided a web site where the viewer can support the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Also, there is listed on the insert various organizations that support the humane treatment of immigrants.Because I am Hispanic, I have always felt sympathy towards illegal immigrants, especially those from Mexico, who risk their lives to come to America.  Remember, unless you are an American Indian, your ancestor was a visitor from another world.  Let us pray that one day we are not forced to seek refuge in a foreign country where we are the visitor.""The Visitor"" teaches us that we should treat everyone with respect, no matter what their color, race, nationality, etc.  Furthermore, we are not to judge someone until we have ""walked in their shoes.""  Walter learns to walk in Tarek's shoes.  Tarek teaches him to play the Djembe.  Nervous and scared to perform in public, Walter eventually gains the confidence to perform on his own in the subway.This remarkable film should be required viewing for all people.  The entire family can watch it TOGETHER.  I didn't see anything objectionable.  It becomes emotional at times and there is some mild violence but nothing to warrant giving it a PG-13 rating.  I highly recommend this bittersweet, poignant drama.  It may make you cry, it may make you laugh, but it will definitely make you think twice about how you treat others who are different.The Anchor Bay DVD presentation for ""The Visitor"" is wonderful.  The colors are vibrant.  The audio is loud and clear.  However, if you are like me and can't hear as well as when you were eighteen, there are English subtitles.  For big fans, there are also plenty of extras:  deleted scenes, a trailer, commentaries, etc.  This DVD is definitely worth the price.",5,"One Day, You May Be The Visitor In A Strange Land",1224633600,"10 22, 2008",2008,3565,"['highly', 'acclaimed', 'drama', 'Walter', 'Vale', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'lonely', 'widower', 'who', 'burned', 'out', 'work', 'little', 'satisfaction', 'economics', 'professor', 'Connecticut', 'merely', 'passing', 'time', 'routine', 'existence', 'boss', 'present', 'paper', 'conference', 'NYU', 'Vale', 'who', 'wealthy', 'apartment', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Soon', 'opening', 'door', 'two', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'Tarek', 'Zainab', 'have', 'been', 'deceived', 'renting', 'apartment', 'friend', 'Omar', 'Instead', 'throwing', 'out', 'Vale', 'sympathetic', 'towards', 'plight', 'continue', 'living', 'there.Tarek', 'Haaz', 'Sleiman', 'Zainab', 'Danai', 'Gurira', 'are', 'adorable', 'Bohemian', 'couple', 'Tarek', 'Syrian', 'Djembe', 'pronounced', 'JEM-bay', 'local', 'night', 'clubs', 'Zainab', 'West', 'African', 'Senegal', 'beautiful', 'handmade', 'jewelry', 'are', 'visitors', 'America', 'Unfortunately', 'live', 'constant', 'fear', 'being', 'deported', 'Walter', 'closer', 'new', 'roommates', 'aristocratic', 'privileged', 'world', 'visitor', 'world', 'days', 'pass', 'friends', 'share', 'much', 'joy', 'sorrow', 'Vale', 'eventually', 'back', 'own', 'world', 'determined', 'help', 'Tarek', 'Zainab', 'own', 'When', 'Tarek', 'charming', 'mom', 'Mouna', 'Hiam', 'Abbass', 'apparent', 'Walter', 'may', 'never', 'go', 'back', 'former', 'lifestyle', 'falling', 'love', 'Visitor', 'designed', 'make', 'viewer', 'feel', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'towards', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'who', 'are', 'arrested', 'held', 'detention', 'centers', 'being', 'deported', 'made', 'evident', 'insert', 'DVD', 'case', 'frightening', 'statistics', 'concerning', 'number', 'immigrants', 'detained', 'U.S.', 'number', 'who', 'have', 'died', 'detention', 'facilities', 'etc', 'also', 'provided', 'web', 'site', 'where', 'viewer', 'can', 'support', 'Universal', 'Declaration', 'Human', 'Rights', 'Also', 'listed', 'insert', 'various', 'organizations', 'support', 'humane', 'treatment', 'immigrants.Because', 'am', 'Hispanic', 'have', 'always', 'felt', 'sympathy', 'towards', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'especially', 'Mexico', 'who', 'risk', 'lives', 'come', 'America', 'Remember', 'are', 'American', 'Indian', 'ancestor', 'was', 'visitor', 'world', 'Let', 'pray', 'one', 'day', 'are', 'not', 'forced', 'seek', 'refuge', 'foreign', 'country', 'where', 'are', 'visitor', 'Visitor', 'should', 'treat', 'everyone', 'respect', 'matter', 'what', 'color', 'race', 'nationality', 'etc', 'Furthermore', 'are', 'not', 'judge', 'someone', 'have', 'walked', 'shoes', 'Walter', 'walk', 'Tarek', 'shoes', 'Tarek', 'play', 'Djembe', 'Nervous', 'scared', 'perform', 'public', 'Walter', 'eventually', 'gains', 'confidence', 'perform', 'own', 'subway.This', 'remarkable', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'people', 'entire', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'TOGETHER', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'objectionable', 'emotional', 'times', 'mild', 'violence', 'nothing', 'warrant', 'giving', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'highly', 'recommend', 'bittersweet', 'poignant', 'drama', 'may', 'make', 'cry', 'may', 'make', 'laugh', 'will', 'definitely', 'make', 'think', 'twice', 'how', 'treat', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'different.The', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'Visitor', 'wonderful', 'colors', 'are', 'vibrant', 'audio', 'loud', 'clear', 'However', 'are', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'were', 'eighteen', 'are', 'English', 'subtitles', 'big', 'fans', 'are', 'also', 'plenty', 'extras', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'trailer', 'commentaries', 'etc', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'worth', 'price']",N/A
1150131,A10LRVZJ2NUKTU,B0015OKWKI,Jesus Santos,"[1, 1]","While watching the film The Visitor many audience members in the United States and all around the world can experience similarity to the plot of the movie. The Visitor is a film directed by Thomas McCarthy, and it explained the beauty of Art and Exiled by explaining the actor in the movie who was an author by the name of Walter Vale, played by Richard Jenkins, and how he was somewhat forced to go outside of his comfort zone and attend a conference in New York City. The audience can relate to his exiled when they understand the feeling of being forced to do something, however the director highlighted this by having the character being lonesome from the loss of his wife. Even throughout the film he said that he likes to keep himself busy by pretending to do something but he is really not doing anything. However, the truth of the film is shown when Walter meets a couple by accident since he thought no one was living in his old apartment and much to his surprise found a lady in the bathroom and almost fought the lady&#8217;s husband. Little did Walter know that they were illegal immigrants using the house as an exile method. The reason why the United States have so many illegal immigrants is because everyone is looking for the American Dream just like this couple was. The dream to make money and start new in a new place even though they have to live their whole lives in fear is better than living their whole lives not knowing if there is anything better for them out there.Surprisingly the director decided to change the film from what is usually done and created a bond between these unlikely characters. Walter, an older man, Tarek and Syria all bond over music, which is the art of the film. Most directors choose to have characters like Walter, an older Caucasian male playing the role of a dictator and would have report them since it would be considering doing his country a service. The director took a different approach and made them bond over Tarek teaching him how to play the drums. In learning how to play the drum Walter realized he had made a new friend, filling the void of losing his wife. Through camera angles, and music the director is able to let the audience figure out the loneliness of Walter by having him follow a certain routine throughout his day, the expression in his face while carrying the routine, the far away shots to get a field of the city liveliness and alone a person can feel being the small fish in big pond. However, the camera angles and movement of the film change once he is introduced to the love of drums and the audience can constantly see the way him and Tarek bond over it; the camera angles are suddenly closer to the character which lets the audience see the reflection of joy from the character, the music is upbeat and happy, the lighting from the film is suddenly brighter and better, and the routine of his day become sporadic and more fulfilling.Suddenly Tarek is committed of a crime he did not do and because he does not have papers in the United States he is facing deportation. Syria grows concern and wonders what this means for her life, and since immigration is a subject of being exiled she has the choice of living in a country that she fears even more now or follow him. The film is heartwarming and audiences can understand their place in the world by questioning the lives of others and how easy they have it compare to those illegal immigrants. The exile part of the film is how one has to be forced to exile the comfort of one&#8217;s home in order to experience the world and service one&#8217;s life better, and the actually exile of the film is to be forced out of one&#8217;s country even though you do not belong with the country home is where you feel you belong. And in many viewers eyes New York was Tarek&#8217;s home. All in all the film was called The Visitors because when entering illegally one is a visitor until they are caught and no longer seen as a wanted guest and have to be forced to leave.",4,The Visitor Art and Exile,1395532800,"03 23, 2014",2014,4002,"['watching', 'film', 'Visitor', 'many', 'audience', 'members', 'United', 'States', 'world', 'can', 'experience', 'similarity', 'plot', 'movie', 'Visitor', 'film', 'directed', 'Thomas', 'McCarthy', 'explained', 'beauty', 'Art', 'Exiled', 'explaining', 'actor', 'movie', 'who', 'was', 'author', 'name', 'Walter', 'Vale', 'played', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'how', 'was', 'somewhat', 'forced', 'go', 'comfort', 'zone', 'attend', 'conference', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'audience', 'can', 'relate', 'exiled', 'when', 'understand', 'feeling', 'being', 'forced', 'do', 'something', 'however', 'director', 'highlighted', 'having', 'character', 'being', 'lonesome', 'loss', 'wife', 'Even', 'film', 'said', 'keep', 'busy', 'pretending', 'do', 'something', 'really', 'not', 'doing', 'anything', 'However', 'truth', 'film', 'shown', 'when', 'Walter', 'couple', 'accident', 'thought', 'one', 'was', 'living', 'old', 'apartment', 'much', 'surprise', 'found', 'lady', 'bathroom', 'almost', 'fought', 'lady', '8217', 's', 'husband', 'Little', 'did', 'Walter', 'know', 'were', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'using', 'house', 'exile', 'method', 'reason', 'why', 'United', 'States', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'everyone', 'looking', 'American', 'Dream', 'just', 'couple', 'was', 'dream', 'make', 'money', 'start', 'new', 'new', 'place', 'even', 'have', 'live', 'whole', 'lives', 'fear', 'better', 'living', 'whole', 'not', 'knowing', 'anything', 'better', 'out', 'there.Surprisingly', 'director', 'decided', 'change', 'film', 'what', 'usually', 'done', 'created', 'bond', 'unlikely', 'characters', 'Walter', 'older', 'man', 'Tarek', 'Syria', 'bond', 'music', 'art', 'film', 'Most', 'directors', 'choose', 'have', 'characters', 'Walter', 'older', 'Caucasian', 'male', 'playing', 'role', 'dictator', 'would', 'have', 'report', 'would', 'be', 'considering', 'doing', 'country', 'service', 'director', 'took', 'different', 'approach', 'made', 'bond', 'Tarek', 'teaching', 'how', 'play', 'drums', 'learning', 'how', 'play', 'drum', 'Walter', 'realized', 'had', 'made', 'new', 'friend', 'filling', 'void', 'losing', 'wife', 'camera', 'angles', 'music', 'director', 'able', 'let', 'audience', 'figure', 'loneliness', 'Walter', 'having', 'follow', 'certain', 'routine', 'day', 'expression', 'face', 'carrying', 'routine', 'far', 'away', 'shots', 'get', 'field', 'city', 'liveliness', 'alone', 'person', 'can', 'feel', 'being', 'small', 'fish', 'big', 'pond', 'However', 'camera', 'angles', 'movement', 'film', 'change', 'introduced', 'love', 'drums', 'audience', 'can', 'constantly', 'see', 'way', 'Tarek', 'bond', 'camera', 'angles', 'are', 'suddenly', 'closer', 'character', 'audience', 'see', 'reflection', 'joy', 'character', 'music', 'upbeat', 'happy', 'lighting', 'film', 'suddenly', 'brighter', 'better', 'routine', 'day', 'become', 'sporadic', 'more', 'fulfilling.Suddenly', 'Tarek', 'committed', 'crime', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'because', 'not', 'have', 'papers', 'United', 'States', 'facing', 'deportation', 'Syria', 'concern', 'what', 'life', 'immigration', 'subject', 'being', 'exiled', 'choice', 'living', 'country', 'even', 'more', 'now', 'follow', 'film', 'heartwarming', 'audiences', 'can', 'understand', 'place', 'world', 'questioning', 'lives', 'others', 'how', 'easy', 'have', 'compare', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'exile', 'part', 'film', 'how', 'one', 'be', 'forced', 'exile', 'comfort', 'one', '8217', 'home', 'order', 'experience', 'world', 'service', 'one', '8217', 's', 'life', 'better', 'actually', 'exile', 'film', 'be', 'forced', 'one', '8217', 's', 'country', 'even', 'do', 'not', 'belong', 'country', 'home', 'where', 'feel', 'belong', 'many', 'viewers', 'eyes', 'New', 'York', 'was', 'Tarek', '8217', 'home', 'film', 'was', 'called', 'Visitors', 'when', 'entering', 'illegally', 'one', 'visitor', 'are', 'caught', 'longer', 'seen', 'wanted', 'guest', 'have', 'be', 'forced', 'leave']",N/A

Jacobs ""Just one man's opinion...""","[0, 1]","I'll have to be careful here as some of the things I wanted to say would partially give away the plot or possibly the ending and those are things you should experience about this movie for yourself.""The Visitor"" is one of those tightly wound, carefully nuanced movies that you need in the telling of this kind of story. For me, the key professionals here, besides the actors, are the writer-director, Thomas McCarthy, his editor (Tom McArdle), director of photography and cinematographer (Oliver Bokelberg), and the composer of the original score (Jan A.P. Kaczmarek). However Richard Jenkins WAS nominated for the Best Actor Oscar that year for his performance here, so it isn't like the writing has to carry the whole movie.Rhythm and tone were two concepts that really stood out to me on this film and it has sort of musical quality to it as you view it. My first time through I read nothing about it before viewing and that worked well. It hit me hard.The first third or so of the film is almost a sort of quirky comedy. Richard Jenkins in the lead role of Walter Vale, a college professor, is pretty much perfect for his role. Watching the film a second time with the commentary ON really opened me up to the little tiny details in his performance that gave it its quiet sense of power.To catch this quality, Bokelberg, the director of photography, has chosen various camera positions and focus variations to enhance the overall feel of the circumstances the actors find themselves in. For example, downshot to convey weakness or isolation, upshot to convey joy and energy. Those choices affect you subconsciously whether you're aware of it or not as you watch any film but especially THIS film. Shots and sets were matched almost perfectly, I thought.The second portion of the film is almost a descent into madness. The disturbing part about that is that this is happening right here in America today. When you think of the cruelty and inhumanity of it, it feels un-American - definitely. We're better than that.The two key folks keeping all of this on track and tightly woven are the editor, Tom McArdle and the composer, Jan A. P. Kaczmarek. (I'll be picking up the soundtrack as well...) The length of time you stay on an expression on an actor's face can completely change the meaning of what that actor is saying... or not saying. When you add and subtract musical elements at just the right times, you aid the editor in his transitions from scene to scene so that they make sense. In this case, that partnership between editor and composer is a just a treat to witness.What I found was that the actors retreated enough into the background that all you were left with was their story... and that was a powerful thing indeed.This is a prime example of a film vs. a movie. It's one of the best I've seen in awhile, and I look forward to it rewarding me during additional viewings for many years to come.

He lives each day passionless and disaffected, unaroused by anyone or anything around him, although there are signs that he is trying to find a way to get connected to life.  As the movie opens, he has been learning to play the piano for many months, although not very successfully and he is dismissing yet another in a long string of piano teachers because he cannot find in himself the passion he either knows exists or should exist in learning to play a musical instrument.Going through his professorial duties on autopilot (he has been teaching the same Economics class for 20 years and cares little about it) Walter is ordered by the dean of the department to travel to New York City to present a paper at a conference that a colleague has written.  Completely unmotivated and viewing the trip as nothing less than a chore, Walter treks into Manhattan to an apartment that he has not used in ""a long  time"" only to encounter two twenty-something illegal aliens living there in Syrian man Tariq (Haaz Sleiman) and his Senegalese girlfriend Zainab (Danai Gurira).  Learning they were conned out of all their money to acquire the apartment several months ago, Walter takes pity on them and lets them stay for a day or two until they find another place to live.However, a friendship soon blossoms between Walter and the outgoing and likeable Tariq who is a gifted musician on a special type of African drum.  Walter begins to find life within himself through the resonant beat of the drum and Tariq's infectious enthusiasm for music and life.  Unfortunately, things suddenly take a turn for the worse when Tariq, a Muslim, is arrested in one of New York's subway stations for allegedly not paying the toll and he is soon incarcerated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and threatened with deportation.  Rationally assuming justice will quickly prevail, Walter soon finds himself deeply moved by Tariq and Zainab's plight and begins to assert himself emotionally in helping them.Note:  Many may not care for the movie's plot which involves illegal immigration in America, especially considering the divisive political times in which we live in regarding this issue as our country struggles over how to integrate the 10's of millions of illegal immigrants now living in the country.  However, the subject of immigration in The Visitor, really serves more as a vehicle for the true theme of the movie....friendship and the discovery of conviction and meaning in one's life.",5,An excellent movie!,1281744000,"08 14, 2010",2010,2803,"['Knowing', 'nothing', 'smaller', 'independent', 'movie', 'rented', 'whim', 'Netflix', 'based', 'several', 'good', 'reviews', 'was', 'deeply', 'moved', 'acting', 'performances', 'storyline.Middle', 'aged', 'Connecticut', 'College', 'professor', 'Walter', 'Vale', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'been', 'widowed', 'several', 'years', ""n't"", 'find', 'much', 'joy', 'life', 'day', 'passionless', 'disaffected', 'unaroused', 'anyone', 'anything', 'are', 'signs', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'get', 'connected', 'life', 'movie', 'been', 'learning', 'play', 'piano', 'many', 'months', 'not', 'very', 'successfully', 'dismissing', 'yet', 'long', 'string', 'piano', 'teachers', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'passion', 'exists', 'should', 'exist', 'learning', 'play', 'musical', 'instrument.Going', 'professorial', 'duties', 'autopilot', 'been', 'teaching', 'same', 'Economics', 'class', '20', 'years', 'little', 'Walter', 'ordered', 'dean', 'department', 'travel', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'present', 'paper', 'conference', 'colleague', 'written', 'Completely', 'unmotivated', 'viewing', 'trip', 'nothing', 'less', 'chore', 'Walter', 'Manhattan', 'apartment', 'not', 'used', 'long', 'time', 'only', 'encounter', 'two', 'twenty-something', 'illegal', 'aliens', 'living', 'there', 'Syrian', 'man', 'Tariq', 'Haaz', 'Sleiman', 'Senegalese', 'girlfriend', 'Zainab', 'Danai', 'Gurira', 'Learning', 'were', 'conned', 'money', 'acquire', 'apartment', 'several', 'months', 'ago', 'Walter', 'pity', 'stay', 'day', 'two', 'find', 'place', 'live.However', 'friendship', 'soon', 'blossoms', 'Walter', 'outgoing', 'likeable', 'Tariq', 'who', 'gifted', 'musician', 'special', 'type', 'African', 'drum', 'Walter', 'find', 'life', 'resonant', 'beat', 'drum', 'Tariq', 'infectious', 'enthusiasm', 'music', 'life', 'Unfortunately', 'things', 'suddenly', 'take', 'turn', 'worse', 'when', 'Tariq', 'Muslim', 'arrested', 'one', 'New', 'York', 'subway', 'stations', 'allegedly', 'not', 'paying', 'toll', 'soon', 'incarcerated', 'Immigration', 'Customs', 'Enforcement', 'threatened', 'deportation', 'Rationally', 'assuming', 'justice', 'will', 'quickly', 'prevail', 'Walter', 'soon', 'deeply', 'moved', 'Tariq', 'Zainab', 'plight', 'assert', 'emotionally', 'helping', 'them.Note', 'Many', 'may', 'not', 'care', 'movie', 'plot', 'illegal', 'immigration', 'America', 'especially', 'considering', 'divisive', 'political', 'times', 'live', 'regarding', 'issue', 'country', 'how', 'integrate', '10', 'millions', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'now', 'living', 'country', 'However', 'subject', 'immigration', 'Visitor', 'really', 'more', 'vehicle', 'true', 'theme', 'movie', '.friendship', 'discovery', 'conviction', 'meaning', 'one', 'life']",N/A

This movie has a very arresting premise and a truly important message for all of us, but I did not quite believe in the central character Walter Vale nor in the actor (Richard Jenkins) playing the role. When the movie ended with a symbolic life-affirming action, I believed in him less. The movie was an earnest, well-meaning film: the character too was an earnest well-meaning, well-intentioned man, but he didn't click for me.He's lonely. He goes to his all-but abandoned apartment in the city and discovers that a couple, a man from Syria and his girlfriend from Senegal are staying there. He lets them stay, and therein begins his transformation from a lonely inner-directed person to a compassionate person interested in others. His new friend teaches Walter how to play the drums, and this becomes the opening-up of his personality. The Syrian man gets arrested, is about to be deported; his mother comes to visit, and Walter falls in love with the mother.It seems like a low-budget indie movie that has an important message to convey, but Walter didn't ring true to me, perhaps because the actor, though competent, may have been miscast.We are a country of immigrants. No man is an island, and we should not be intolerant of or opposed to immigrants who have something to add to our society.

He is involved with a conference on internationalization and globalization, that he would rather not have had to attend.  When he arrives at his second residence, he discovers he has guests, not his though, living there.Vale is a very sensitive guy, has a lot of hang ups, but we learn as we get to know the character, he has lost a lot in his life and has had tried to stay somewhat connected with it.  His visitors, Tarek (Slieman) and his girlfriend Zainab, played by Danai Gurira.  As Vale gets them to leave, he realizes that they are harmless toward him and tells them to stay until they find a place.  As the days of the conference pass, Vale sees Tarek playing the African drum, the Djembe.  Symbolic of its ability to be shared and to bring people together (we learn this in the extras), we have the drum and Vale's desire to learn to play a central theme.Vale has failed at his attempts to learn to play piano.  His relationship with Tarek and the Djembe are a turn around for Vale.  This is all so short lived as Tarek is eventually taken into custody with immigration due to his status.  We get the sense though is that Tarek is here for the right reasons, and we get a view that some who flee here from countries we tend to fear today, come for the same reasons that all who came here did.  We see and hear about Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty and the joy that Tarek and Zainab have for being here.This is definately a movie that is making a statement, and would it be nice to focus on why freedom loving peoples of all sorts come here to seek a better life.  Gurira is very believable as a Sengalese woman.  It is surprising to see here speak in the extras section, you can view her in the links on the main Visitor page here on Amazon, but I would wait to see that in the extras, she is amazing.  Slieman draws you in to his role.  You are not quite sure when you meet him if he is a good guy or not.  Jenkins, as Vale, sets the tone for his character and for the film.This is inspiring to me.  It gives us a view that there just may be people here with other motives.  Can we find them, and help them to speak for the many who share their hopes and desires.  Can we somehow find a way to support giving them a chance while finding and screening out those whose desires are less than what anyone would want?The Visitor may make us think of a few more questions we need to ask ourselves.  Although we desire to protect our country and our future, can that be done with a view that many people who are just that, people, are involved in trying to find a better life.

Menta, Jr.","[1, 2]","""The Visitor"" is entertaining and thought-provoking, and perhaps argument-provoking, too, depending on your view of the immigration issue.  Basically, if you've read the reviews, you've seen the movie: fate throws together a sleepwalking-through-life college professor and two illegal immigrants, with the professor and the immigrants growing in various ways from their unlikely friendship.  The predictability of the premise isn't fatal to the proceedings by any means, as it's nice to see the humanity of the characters unfold, especially as their situations become more difficult.  I've always responded to kindness in movies (a moment of genuine kindness is more likely to make me tear up than a moment of sadness), and there's a lot of kindness on display here.Also, any predictability is offset by several small touches, grace notes, and non-predictable elements: the immigrants aren't uneducated and helpless (they're quite worldly, in fact), just regular people in a bad situation; Richard Jenkins' professor character Walter Vale isn't totally lost and messed up at the film's start, just a good man who's drifted into making his routine control his life instead of vice versa (a fate most of us can be subject if we're not careful); and the acting across the board is deep and resonant, as two or three things seem to be going on in the characters' minds and on their faces even during black-and-white situations where one response (anger, happiness, etc.) would have been fine.The DVD features a warm, rich image and sharp sound that does justice to the musical aspect of the film, which is considerable.  Special features include the film's trailer, a tiny little ""behind the scenes"" featurette (about five minutes), a tiny deleted scenes section (also about five minutes), and an interview with the drum expert who helped coach the actors (maybe about six or seven minutes).  There's also a commentary track.I watched ""The Visitor"" a day or two after Barack Obama's historic victory in the presidential election, so maybe the hopefulness of that dramatic night made me see the movie- even with all the sadness and disappointment the characters feel, especially during the movie's latter half- as ultimately a hopeful reminder that, if we want to, we can reach out in a multicultural world and find solutions to our problems and challenges.",4,"Fate creates new friendships and new reasons to live, but new sadness, too",1226275200,"11 10, 2008",2008,2352,"['Visitor', 'entertaining', 'thought-provoking', 'perhaps', 'argument-provoking', 'too', 'depending', 'view', 'immigration', 'issue', 'Basically', ""'ve"", 'read', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'fate', 'together', 'sleepwalking-through-life', 'college', 'professor', 'two', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'professor', 'immigrants', 'growing', 'various', 'ways', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'predictability', 'premise', ""n't"", 'fatal', 'proceedings', 'means', 'nice', 'see', 'humanity', 'characters', 'unfold', 'especially', 'situations', 'become', 'more', 'difficult', ""'ve"", 'always', 'responded', 'kindness', 'movies', 'moment', 'genuine', 'kindness', 'more', 'likely', 'make', 'tear', 'up', 'moment', 'sadness', 'lot', 'kindness', 'display', 'here.Also', 'predictability', 'offset', 'several', 'small', 'touches', 'grace', 'notes', 'non-predictable', 'elements', 'immigrants', 'are', ""n't"", 'uneducated', 'helpless', ""'re"", 'quite', 'worldly', 'fact', 'just', 'regular', 'people', 'bad', 'situation', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'professor', 'character', 'Walter', 'Vale', ""n't"", 'totally', 'lost', 'messed', 'up', 'film', 'start', 'just', 'good', 'man', 'who', 'drifted', 'making', 'routine', 'control', 'life', 'instead', 'vice', 'versa', 'fate', 'most', 'can', 'be', 'subject', ""'re"", 'not', 'careful', 'acting', 'board', 'deep', 'resonant', 'two', 'three', 'things', 'seem', 'be', 'going', 'characters', 'minds', 'even', 'black-and-white', 'situations', 'where', 'one', 'response', 'anger', 'happiness', 'etc', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fine.The', 'DVD', 'warm', 'rich', 'image', 'sharp', 'sound', 'justice', 'musical', 'aspect', 'film', 'considerable', 'Special', 'features', 'include', 'film', 'trailer', 'tiny', 'little', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'five', 'minutes', 'tiny', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'section', 'also', 'about', 'five', 'minutes', 'interview', 'drum', 'expert', 'who', 'helped', 'coach', 'actors', 'maybe', 'six', 'seven', 'minutes', 'also', 'commentary', 'track.I', 'watched', 'Visitor', 'day', 'two', 'Barack', 'Obama', 'historic', 'victory', 'presidential', 'election', 'maybe', 'hopefulness', 'dramatic', 'night', 'made', 'see', 'movie-', 'even', 'sadness', 'disappointment', 'characters', 'feel', 'especially', 'movie', 'latter', 'half-', 'ultimately', 'hopeful', 'reminder', 'want', 'can', 'reach', 'out', 'multicultural', 'world', 'find', 'solutions', 'problems', 'challenges']",N/A

He visits his New York City apartment to find that two illegal immigrants have taken refuge there. From that point on the film follows their ever growing friendship as Walter slowly learns to open himself back up to the world and let the wonders of life carry him. The film itself is incredibly well layed out and the characters all fully developed. McCarthy is an actor turned director and that is usually cause for concern, but when I saw his first film, The Station Agent I knew that he was a fully capable storyteller.Jenkins is an amazing character actor and portrays Walter as a very reserved and closed off person who has basically shut himself off from the world after losing his wife. Tarek who is one of the immigrants is a very skilled drum player, and through music is how Walter learns to become expressive again. He learns to play the drum through Tarek and music becomes his vessel of emotion. If you've seen McCarthy's previous film you will see the recurring theme of isolation and acceptance. That comes to play when his friend Tarek is asked for an ID and doesn't have one and is  thus sent to the department of immigration.The film plays out and the conclusion is emotionally stirring. If I had to say one thing negative about the story is that the ending is left a bit open ended and to me does not fully conclude Walter's story, but that's just nitpicking. It holds well on its own without getting too preachy about the subject of illegal immigration, which is good. Movies that end up trying to sell a cause versus a story usually don't have a satisfying effect on me, but this one did.

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","As I know the topic of illegal immigrants can be a hot button issue, I'm sure there will be some who will dismiss ""The Visitor"" as a bit of propaganda. And the film certainly has an agenda. The immigrants in question are a terrific, life-affirming bunch. The bureaucracy, as to be expected, is insensitive. Most scenes involving immigration officials portray them as dismissive and uncooperative. But the film never lingers on these scenes, instead it focuses on the quiet moments of a family in crisis. By being a great character study, ""The Visitor"" tells an individual story with the power to move and even uplift the audience.Richard Jenkins (""Six Feet Under"") gives a terrifically understated performance as a academician just going through the motions of life. Attending a conference in New York, he happens upon a couple who have illegally sublet his New York apartment. Instead of being outraged, he opens his home and heart to the young tenants. Experiencing the city through new eyes, Jenkins starts a process of rebirth. He especially connects with Tarek (Haaz Sleiman), a young man who introduces him to drumming and has such vitality. Sleiman gives an extraordinary performance. It's easy to see what appeals to Jenkins--so when Tarek is apprehended in the subway, Jenkins steps up in a most unexpected way.Jenkins deals with Tarek's mother in a refreshingly mature coupling and becomes consumed with helping his young friend. Far from the empty life he has been leading, these new friends and this mission redefine what is important to him. All the performances are so solid, but Jenkins especially carries a heavy load. He undergoes a huge transformation but never ""acts"" it. The film is so quiet, the screenplay so understated, and the performances so subtle--it's a perfect balancing act by writer/director Tom McCarthy (the equally unexpected charmer ""The Station Agent.""I admired ""The Visitor"" immensely. And while it's a serious and dignified film, it is also an enjoyable one. It may be one of the most quietly affecting films of the years. As its power sneaks up on you, the film makes an impact. A great character study and a potent human drama--even if you're put off by the subject, ""The Visitor"" is a well constructed and pitch perfect look at one family's story! Take a look.

This is how the story goes: In a world of six billion people, it only takes one to change your life. Sixty-two-year-old Walter Vale is sleepwalking through his life. Having lost his passion for teaching and writing, he fills the void by unsuccessfully trying to learn to play classical piano. When his college sends him to Manhattan to attend a conference, Walter is surprised to find a young couple has taken up residence in his apartment. Victims of a real estate scam, Tarek, a Syrian man, and Zainab, his Senegalese girlfriend, have nowhere else to go. In the first of a series of tests of the heart, Walter reluctantly allows the couple to stay with him. Touched by his kindness, Tarek, a talented musician, insists on teaching the aging academic to play the African drum. The instrument's exuberant rhythms revitalize Walter's faltering spirit and open his eyes to a vibrant world of local jazz clubs and Central Park drum circles. As the friendship between the two men deepens, the differences in culture, age and temperament fall away. After being stopped by police in the subway, Tarek is arrested as an undocumented citizen and held for deportation. As his situation turns desperate, Walter finds himself compelled to help his new friend with a passion he thought he had long ago lost. When Tarek's beautiful mother Mouna arrives unexpectedly in search of her son, the professor's personal commitment develops into an unlikely romance. And it's through these new found connections with these virtual strangers that Walter is awakened to a new world and a new life.The cast led by Richard Jenkins (in an Oscar-worthy performance as Walter Vale) is brilliant!

1150152,A30IP5D5DLHRPA,B0015OKWKI,Kyle Slayzar,"[1, 2]","I'm always up for a good story when it comes to movies and The Visitor certainly is no exception.  It's a classic tale of East meets West against the backdrop of our War on Terror and Immigration Policy (such as it is).The story is simple, yet elegant.  A ROAD (Retired On Active Duty) college professor is just surviving life.  He teaches only one class, rarely works on his book, considers reading a book ""co-authoring,"" and just cannot seem to find his niche in life.  His life changes dramatically when he is forced to attend a conference in NYC to discover strange guests residing in his summer apartment.  I won't give away the rest but the rest of the movie addresses our immigration policy and how we treat illegal immigrants and refugees.Despite the story's simplicity, it flows fairly well and is quite compelling.  Between the initial friction of the stranger's girlfriend and the professor, the musical tastes of the stranger, and how the professor finds redemption in the most unlikely way (sorry guys, get the movie if you wanna know the rest *RASPBERRY*), the audience has plenty of elements to become involved with and feel a personal connection in some way.Now, some people I watched The Visitor with had some concerns over the preachiness of the movie itself involving our immigration policy since the majority of the film focuses around the injustice of how we, as a nation, treat detained illegal immigrants.  I agree that the movie is preachy to a certain degree, however, I can also see how The Visitor is also a critique on how we treat refugees (although some will argue there is not difference).  If anything, illegal immigrants escaping Senegal and Syria can be considered political refugees given the volatile situations there now.Either way, at least the film doesn't distinguish between party lines like many in Hollywood have in recent years, which alienates audiences.  They just distinguish between immigrants/refugees and naturalized citizens.Now, on to the technical aspects.The musical accompaniment was lovely.  I don't remember exactly the names of the composers but there was a great deal of classical music and piano works.  While it is almost exclusively public domain selection, it fits perfectly in the scenes whether it's the mother of the stranger cleaning the apartment (which was surprisingly a beautiful scene), or the professor slumping to dinner at his home in Connecticut.The camera work was non-distracting, which is always a plus.  I cannot stand it when directors try ""new"" things and end up ruining it for the rest of us.  As far as camera and editing goes, it was very nondescript, which is the way it should be for simplistic movies.

He has a shallow meaningless life now that his wife has died and tries to learn piano at retirement age.  His job as professor has not changed for years, teaching the same class over and over and he is stuck in a rut.Vale has to leave his Connecticut home to speak at a conference in Manhattan, that his college insists he participate.  Vale arrives at his Manhattan apartment which he has not visited since his wife died.  He is is surprised when he finds a young immigrant couple, Tarek (Haaz Sleiman) and Zainab (Danai Guira) living quite comfortably and they are upset he came in.  They claim a friend rented the apartment to them.At this point I was surprised at no anger either way as the young couple packs their belongings and leaves to find somewhere to stay.  For some reason Vale takes pity and invites them back to stay ""a couple of days.""  Tarek teaches Vale how to play an African drum and Vale drops his Classical music and goes for the drums.Vale learns that Tarek is from Syria and Zainab is from Senegal.  Tarek has talent with the drums and Zainab sells homemade jewelry near the park Tarek plays his drums.  Tarek wants to thank Vale for letting them stay and teaches him the drums and a friendship develops.  They are linked by the vibrant, lively music and playing together.Since this film was made in 2007, post 9-11 we are reminded constantly of security, American Flags and their fear of being caught.  Tarek and Zainab are both illegal aliens, but the movie goes to great lengths explaining it is not their fault, all they want is a better life.  Tarek's mother Mouna (Hiam Abbass) arrives and explains she is at fault for Tarek not having his papers - after he is put into detention.The movie gives the ideal plot of cultural barriers being broken through music - and finding the beat of a different drummer gives Walter a new world and a new life.

LOL. What's a director to do? I thought the movie presented the issues fairly and I can't call myself either liberal or conservative these days.The movie has a deft and sensitive touch in chronicling the developing friendship between two young illegals and a jaded, bored professor. His wife having just died recently, the professor is understandably depressed, and seems to take little enjoyment with anything in his life, and he takes up piano lessons as a diversion, for which he seems to have little talent. The professor has been teaching the same economics class for 20 years at a small college but has little interest in his job anymore.Then along comes a young couple from Africa who throw a wrench into the professor's collegial and comfortable but dull, routinized life when he finds them living in his New York apartment. He let's them stay until they can find another place. The young man is a talented bongo player, and he encourages the professor to take up African drums, which he does, and displays more talent for bongos than the piano. These events take up about the first half of the movie, and despite the somewhat somber tone of the movie these developments are overall very positive.The movie takes a dramatically darker turn in the last half when the young man is discovered to be an illegal alien and is detained pending possible deportation. At this point we meet the young man's mother who travels to New York to try to help her son, and she and the professor also develop a friendship as they together try to resolve the young man's difficulties with the INS.I won't say how it turns out so as not to reveal any spoilers, but this movie is a sensitive portrayal of how people from completely different walks of life and even different cultures can find a common interest through music, which may be the only truly universal human language.

1150159,A36EW68H08UOCS,B0015OKWKI,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[0, 1]","Thomas McCarthy's film ""The Visitor"" is a low-key but nonetheless thrilling movie. Several of the key characters are illegal immigrants and the reason I bring this up is that the Mrs. and at least one reviewer couldn't get around the topic of illegal immigration, although I liked the movie very much and James Berardinelli wrote ""In The Visitor, there are no human villains. No one wears a black hat. The antagonist is The System - the nameless, faceless arm of a bureaucracy that flexes its muscles and crushes whoever happens to be in its grip at the time.""My feeling about immigrants is that except for Native Americans, we are ALL either immigrants or descended from immigrants in the U.S. (And I also try to keep in mind that some American ancestors ""immigrated"" here by force, against their wishes, to be slaves.) If they obey the laws, pay their taxes, etc, I have no problem with those who want to enjoy the privileges I earned simply by being born.Anyway - I wanted a disclaimer to say that if illegal immigrants could not possibly be sympathetic characters to you, you may not appreciate the delicate beauty in ""The Visitor"".  I think Thomas McCarthy would deserve kudos for writing OR directing - he gets a double pat on the back for both.You may not recognize the name Richard Jenkins, even though his performance here was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.  He plays Economics Professor Walter Vale.  After years playing the cop, the administrator, the dead father in ""Six Feet Under"" he gets his first starring role, and not many can claim an Oscar nomination in their first starring role. In his early sixties, Professor Vale is a lonely, lonely man.  His wife, a classical pianist who was well-known, has passed on.  No children are ever mentioned.  Walter is going through the motions of teaching and life up in Connecticut.  He earned enough laurels early in his career that a younger colleague asks to add his name to a paper - to make it more prestigious and able to be published.  When she goes on maternity bedrest the dept head orders Walter to go to a meeting to present ""their"" paper.  Walter admits to his boss that he hasn't even read the paper that bears his name.Walter drives into the city and lets himself into his apartment.  He surprises an African woman in his bathtub and her boyfriend rushes over to push Walter against a wall, thinking him an intruder. The situation is quickly sorted out - the Syrian man Tarek Khalil (played with infectious optimism by Haaz Sleiman) and the woman from Senegal, Zainab (played with believable caution by Danai Gurira) ""rented"" the apartment from some opportunist who noted it unoccupied.  Tarek and Zainab gather their modest belongings and leave.  Walter finds a framed photo left behind and sees them outside at a pay phone, practically begging for a place for the night.  Walter invites them back to the apartment to stay the night.A cautious friendship develops between Walter and the young couple.  Tarek, friendly and engaging, is an accomplished African drummer.  Zainab, cautious perhaps both because of their status as illegals and because of being duped into ""renting"" Walter's apartment, is quiet and respectful around their benefactor.The relationship begins to thaw Walter's soul.  He obviously loved his wife's playing, and has been taking piano lessons so that her piano doesn't sit dormant, but he is stuck at some rudimentary beginning level and his heart is not into it.  You can feel his frustration at not playing very well, but even more, missing the music of his wife, both literally and figuratively.  (When it is plain Walter is ""phoning it in"" back at the University, you get the idea that he is given some leeway both because of his past accomplishments, but also because of the loss of his wife.)  Tarek invites Walter to the club where he plays drums and sings with a Jazz combo.Walter is a rank beginner on the piano, and has never touched a drum, but something about the inviting Tarek draws Walter to try a few whacks on the skin.  Tarek discovers Walter taking a few tentative blows on his drum, then provides an impromptu lesson.  Later, he invites him to a drumming jam in Central Park.  Walter is hesitant, then takes a seat beside the other African drummers, adding his flavor to the musical mixture.Returning on the subway, something looks irregular as Tarek and Walter pass the drums over the turnstiles and the cops move in and arrest Tarek. They pay no heed to Walter - the well-dressed white man is not ""suspicious"", but neither is his word enough for them to let Tarek go.Tarek is taken to a detention facility.  He goes home to tell Zainab, who knows her relationship with Tarek is doomed in the United States.  She moves out rather than stay with the Professor who is little more than a stranger to her.  Tarek's mother, Mouna (played with elegant honor by Hiam Abass), drives down from Michigan when Tarek doesn't answer her phone calls.A tentative relationship begins between Walter and Mouna - only friendly - the actions of a concerned family member.  Zainab and Mouna can't quite understand why this stranger is so helpful to them.  Initially they don't understand that they are the only ""family"" he has.Will Tarek be deported?  Does romance blossom between Walter and Mouna?  This film answers these questions believably. Honestly.  It is a good film.",5,A Family includes anyone who acts as family,1242086400,"05 12, 2009",2009,5387,"['Thomas', 'McCarthy', 'film', 'Visitor', 'low-key', 'nonetheless', 'thrilling', 'movie',

The lead actor is excellent as a quiet, isolated, middle-aged man.  As he meets two younger people from outside the US, he grows to care about them and begins to come out of his shell.  Very real, very sweet, very interesting in a quiet, understated way.Then in the middle of the film there's an abrupt shift.  It becomes very run-of-the-mill and the characters begin turning to cardboard.  All US government officials are portrayed as evil and uncaring, while all immigrants are seen as gentle and good.  The USA becomes the Great Satan once again.Then there's another shift and it becomes a sweet, middle-aged love story.  Not bad, but not the film I signed up to see.  It ends with ""the bad guys"" and loneliness winning--so don't see it if you're prone to depression.Oh, and the cover picture on the DVD gives away the end.

1150161,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0015OKWKI,mirasreviews,"[4, 4]","""The Visitor"" is the second film in which writer/director Tom McCarthy presents an emotionally perceptive story of relationships that develop between people who meet by chance. Walter Vale (Richard Jenkins) is a widowed economics professor who takes no interest in anything at this stage of his life. When he reluctantly travels to New York to present a paper at a conference, he is surprised to find a young couple living in the Manhattan apartment that he seldom uses. Tarek Khalil (Haaz Sleiman), a musician from Syria, and his Senegalese girlfriend Zainab (Danai Gurira) have illegally sublet the apartment. They are apologetic and eager to avoid trouble, but Walter invites them to stay until they find another place. Walter finds himself irresistibly drawn to Tarek's African drum and deeply concerned about the couple's plight when their immigration status is discovered.There is a political statement here about the inflexibility of immigrations law, especially for Muslims, since the events of 9/11. But the story is Walter's re-engagement in life. It's a pleasure to watch him find some reason to do something after years of apathy. Tarek's drums, his incarceration, and finally Tarek's elegant and worried mother Mouna (Hiam Abbass) bring Walter to life, with the help of a restrained performance by Richard Jenkins. Hiam Abbass has fantastic presence and evokes great sympathy as a self-contained woman who blames herself for her son's problems. I would recommend the film for her appeal alone. But Mouna and Walter are both interesting characters, isolated in their own way, from different subcultures, who have collided with unexpected results. ""The Visitor"" is a character study with strong elements of both optimism and pessimism.The DVD (Anchor Bay 2008): Both widescreen and full screen versions are on the same disc. Bonus features are 2 featurettes, a theatrical trailer, 4 deleted scenes with optional commentary, and a feature commentary by writer/director Tom McCarthy and actor Richard Jenkins.  ""An Inside Look at The Visitor"" (5 min) interviews the director and cast about characters and themes. ""Playing the Djembe"" (7 1/2 min) interviews McCarthy and djembe coach Mohammad Naseehu Ali about the drum and his involvement in the film, as well as Richard Jenkins and Haaz Sleiman about their characters and training on the drum. The commentary by McCarthy and Jenkins is not constant, but it doesn't have large gaps. They talk about sets, locations, cast, and their recollections of filming.

1150162,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B0015OKWKI,Monty Moonlight,"[0, 0]","Professor Walter Vale, a widower who has been sleeping his way through life in a job he doesn't care about, receives an unexpected awakening when he returns to his New York apartment one night to find a young immigrant couple has taken up residence there while he was away. He resigns to allow the couple to live with him, and as Walter's friendship with the male of the two, Tarek, grows through lessons in playing the African djembe drum, his passion for life becomes renewed. But Walter's uplifting new path takes a sharp and unfortunate turn when Tarek is arrested and held for being in the country illegally. Suddenly, we find ourselves in the midst of an unexpected struggle that is the heart of ""The Visitor"", and Walter is sure to never be the same.Watching ""The Visitor"", it is easy to understand why Richard Jenkins was nominated for the Best Actor Oscar for his passionate portrayal of Walter Vale in this fine independent film. Putting the topical aspect aside, the film is truly well done and surprisingly not a bit dull (if you can sit through a movie without explosions or things of that nature). It moves at a fine pace and stays interesting with outstanding performances all around. Kudos to director Thomas McCarthy for his excellent work here. Bringing the social issue back into play however, we all know this is a touchy subject for a lot of people. The film presents a straightforward and realistic view of things, though be warned that it is definitely a specific point of view, and that is the unsurprisingly more pro-illegal immigrants/anti-immigration laws viewpoint. ""The Visitor"" does an excellent job at pointing out the unpleasant and some might say inhumane treatment of those detained for being ""illegals"". Still, it's important to see that there are reasonable gripes on both sides of an issue like this, but one can't really flaw a film for showing only one side of an issue if that is the side the story takes place on. So, again, overall this is an outstanding film. It is an emotional ride and, as I said, full of great performances, though Richard Jenkins is without a doubt the star. Richard's performance, however, is wonderfully complemented by that of Hiam Abbass as Tarek's mother, and their characters' relationship really takes the film to another level.""The Visitor"" gets a nice DVD presentation here in anamorphic widescreen with full frame option, and there is a good director commentary with Richard Jenkins sitting in too. You also get a behind the scenes documentary, a featurette on the djembe drum, deleted scenes, and the film's trailer. If the immigration subject or the subject of a man trying to rediscover his passion and inner rhythm appeals to you, I can definitely recommend ""The Visitor"" for some fine performances in a well-made, touching and thought provoking film.",5,"Surprise!

Recently a widower, Walter is a quiet reserved man who keeps to himself and doesn't have much passion for anything in life these days.  He begrudgingly accepts the task of going back to his hometown of New York City in order to give a lecture on a paper he co-authored, but didn't really work much on.  When he arrives at his old apartment, which he hasn't been back to in years, Walter is surprised to find a man and woman already living inside.  The two want no trouble and agree to leave, but Walter, feeling bad for them, agrees to allow them to stay.  It turns out that both are illegal immigrants.  Zainah, the woman, is very quiet and reserved, and keeps a cool emotional distance from Walter.  On the other hand, Tarek, her boyfriend, is quite open and kind with Walter, who shows an interest in the instrument he plays, an African drum known as the djembe.  Tarek begins to teach Walter how to play and the two soon become fast friends.Unfortunately things get ugly for Tarek.  He is arrested, while entering the local subway with Walter, and taken to a detention center for illegal immigrants, where he could wind up being deported.  Despite pressures from his boss to return to Connecticut, Walter agrees to stay in New York City in order to help.  Eventually he meets Tarek's mother, Mouna, who after not hearing from her son, journeys from her home in Michigan to find out what has happened.  She and Walter become close as the two do everything they can to help Tarek get released.Writer/Director Tom McCarthy, who already showed his expertise for the intricacies of interpersonal relationships with his previous film,The Station Agent, does so again here with The Visitor.  Except now another element has been added to the mix, which is the heavier theme of illegal immigrants living in the United States.  This theme is handled very well, in an honest and straightforward manner.  The acting in the film is first-rate.  Richard Jenkins (Six Feet Under) does a fine job as Walter Vale, showcasing a man whose empty life has now found hope and meaning.  Newcomers, Haaz Sleiman (Tarek) and Danai Gurira (Zainah) are also very effective in their roles too as the struggling couple, hoping to remain together.  Haaz's work with Richard Jenkins, in particular, is quite strong and effective.  But the icing on the cake has got to be Hiam Abbass (The Syrian Bride,Paradise Now) as Mouna, who plays Tarek's mother so beautifully; it's like watching an actor at the top of their game.  Her scenes with both Richard and Danai are simply wonderful.Special Features Include:Audio Commentary - with Writer/Director Tom McCarthy & Actor Richard Jenkins.  (Good commentary, though Richard Jenkins says very little.  Tom McCarthy explains why so many American flags wind up being seen in the film)""An Inside Look At The Visitor"" (4:48) - a short behind the scenes look at the making of the film, with interviews from Writer/Director Tom McCarthy, and Actor's Richard Jenkins, Haaz Sleiman, and Danai Gurira.  (Nice, but should have been much longer.)""Playing The Djembe"" (7:48) - a delightful featurette on the use of the djembe drum in the film, with interviews by Djembe Coach, Mohammed Naseehu Ali, Writer/Director Tom McCarthy, and Actor's Richard Jenkins (who actually played drums at a young age) & Haaz Sleiman (who never played drums at all until working on this film.)Deleted Scenes [w/optional audio commentary] (Total Time 3:20):""American Grill With Karen"" (0:48) - this scene shows Walter stopping off at a bar and grill, while in Connecticut, and coming into contact with and old flame from his past.""Cocktails At The Conference"" (0:22) - a quick scene of Walter at the conference, with Writer/Director Tom McCarthy's brother-in-law, John, and brother, Steve playing his associates.""Omar Says Hello"" (0:56) - a friend of Tarek's greets him and Walter while they're eating at a falafel stand.""Jacob Meets Mouna"" (1:14) - Walter's neighbor, Jacob, is introduced to Mouna.  This was actor Richard Kind's second scene in the film, which was cut for pacing.  It further highlights the character's isolation as well as his need for companionship.Original Theatrical Trailer (2:32)This is a very enjoyable character based film that lives up to the praise it has received.  Having seen and been impressed by both this film and The Station Agent, I look forward to Tom McCarthy's next project.  He is a fine writer and director.The VisitorColor 104 Min.

1150165,A3ZMC6NFTXEKO,B0015OKWKI,"M. R. Griffin ""griffinfinity""","[0, 1]","One of the major issues leftover from W.'s administration was immigration. `The Visitor' addresses the thorny subject by presenting a story of four people affected by it. As with most issues on this country's agenda, it's not quite so cut and dried as people make it out to be. One might assume you are either for or against. `The Visitor' tears that apart and forces the viewer to re-examine the complexities involved. And I'm not sure that by the last act we can be certain who the `Visitor' truly is.Aside from some sober realities, `The Visitor' is full of magic on many levels. Richard Jenkins plays `Walter', an academic who appears to be not merely burned out, but a scorched shell of an individual that has been sleepwalking through life. His world changes as many do when a chance occurrence presents him with a decision requiring a spark of humanity.On the opposite end of the spectrum (and a welcome balance) are Zainab (Dania Gurira)and Tarek (Haaz Sleiman). They are a young couple who live life to it's absolute fullest , while traveling on a near empty tank of gas. They embody every bit of spirit, hope and determination of those who came before them in the massive wave of immigration from the early days of the last century.An excellent performance from Hiam Abbass (Mouna) lifts the film to new heights. Her addition to the cast was that good. The savvy film goer might be tempted to believe they have gotten the best of the plot guessing game with her arrival. Perhaps. But by this time in the story, anxiety begins to creep in and soon the viewer will be gripped by the decisions leading to the finale.My paternal Grandparents were among those afforded the opportunity for a new life in America.

I won't go into plot details, others in the review list have done that.If you let this movie into your heart, as main character Walter allows his foreign visitors into his, you will be moved.When watching this film, given the upcoming election in the USA, I couldn't help but think of the alarming polarization of our country, the messages of hate, divisiveness and exclusion which are being tossed around so blatantly, and the unbelievable but true fact that significant numbers of Americans, both young and old, would vote based solely on.......the color of a person's skin! An entire political campaign has been run on the idea of fear and racism, by people who claim to be followers of Jesus Christ. Does anyone else see the craziness of this?? Will we ever grow up?Pardon the mini-rant! I doubt filmmaker McCarthy was even thinking of this when he penned the screenplay. But that lesson is inherent in the film. We need to be color blind; we need to reach out to our fellow travelers with kindness and charity. We need to accept people for who they are--human beings, just like us--and quit fearing, categorizing and judging them. That's what Walter does, and his life is wonderfully enriched because of it.The scene in the park with all the drummers is so uplifting, it brought tears to my eyes. Walter is hesitant to sit in; he feels horribly self-conscious and uncomfortably out of place. He's wearing a sportcoat and tie, he's bald, he's a middle-aged white guy. He hangs back, despite Tarik's words of encouragement, and after what seems like an eternity...he finally says to himself, what the hell....and takes the plunge. And has a blast. This wonderfully affirmative scene epitomizes the movie.The Visitor is a very small, understated film; it's the kind of movie that, when you look for it in the video store, you will probably find only one copy. That is a shame, because this could be such a powerful healer of the wounds of division, ignorance and hatred in this country.It's a visual lesson in how to live with and love one another, and it's delivered at a crucial time in our history.

A simple story of cross culture, immigration, and loneliness, the screenplay carries us into the vastly understated lives of of the four main characters; Walter Vale, the lonely introverted widower who has lost meaning in his life; Tarek, the lively and life positive illegal from Syria; Zainab, Tarek's all too human Sengalese girlfriend, and Mouna, Tarek's mother, whose painful past life and future hopes are always visible in her eyes.What makes this film unique is that the film shows the viewer story elements by exclusion, by what is NOT said, by the moments of silence between characters, by the incidents of realistically portrayed uncomfortable conversations between the characters. The viewer feels as if he is eavesdropping  on real people who live in a multicultural environment. This method of storytelling is more European than American and  will make the film overly long for some despite its short length.

Tom McCarthy's previous film ""The Station Agent"" was equally good and followed the similar theme of friendship.  This film again reminded me of what my father tells me that you can't pick your family (Mom, Dad, siblings, ...) or your boss.  Well, that leaves just one thing that we can choose.  It is our friends which sometimes happens in our everyday routine or extreme situations like this one.  Friendship is such a dynamic relationship that always changes.  It begins and ends as well as changes in between.In this film, we see a lonely man, Walter, who shapes his life around a friendship with a young man, Tarek.  The most unlikely friendship between a old guy set in his ways and a young guy who is willing to share his love of drums.  They meet together in the most unpleasant situation from a landlord who signs 2 leases to the same apartment.  What happens is part of the pleasure which I won't give away.  Other friendships between Walter and Tarek's girlfriend and mother resonates strongly.Alot of this film reminds me of my life where people touch me in different ways.  Often times, we remember the good in those friends and it's sad to see them go.  But, there is one thing that we take away from it.  We pass along those small treasures from one to another and don't forget.  In this case, Walt found a love for the drums and it will remind him of his friend, Tarek.  I saw alot of Tarek in my friends who dig me out of my shell.  It made me discover some interests and talents in myself.This film has a few extras like ""Behind the Scenes"" and ""Playing the Djembe"" which are interesting.  I recently went to a film discussion on ""The Visitor"" which over-analyzed this film.  So, I encourage just to see the extras and decide for yourself.  To me, I just take this film at face-value on everday lives between strangers who build friendships.

Noble,"[1, 1]","MovieThe VisitorReviewBy Richard Edward NobleBecause of the current political animosities, this movie will not get the credit it deserves.Richard Jenkins gives a wonderful performance of the main character, Walter.He plays a college professor, a widower. He is clearly a very lost and lonely man, though well off, successful in academia and living a secure existence.Walter does not know what to do with himself.He is totally bored with his life and his career.We are never introduced to his deceased wife but she is felt strongly in Walter's lost and lonely state.Walter is ordered to go to New York and present a paper. He doesn't want to go. He didn't even write the paper. But he must.When he arrives at his apartment - a second home from which he has been absent for years - he finds to the peril of his life that it is occupied.The intruders are there, unaware that they have leased the apartment illegally. Walter manages to explain his position and the intruders agree to leave.Walter takes pity and relents. They are allowed to stay until they can find a new apartment.Walter then becomes our guide to the underworld of illegal immigration. Both of his guests are here in the U.S. without legal permission. Via Water's naivet&eacute; we are taken on a tour of this world within a world.Walter knows nothing of his guests' situation or this third world within our first world nation.Walter's melancholy dominates yet there is an excitement that builds in the viewer as we are all led through the intrigue that follows.All the acting is superb.The story is real, honest and heart rendering.This is a great movie. I have watched it twice and I'm sure I will watch it again in the future.I was able to associate with every character in the movie.I have even been inspired by Walter and his musical aspirations. I am an amateur jazz drummer and since watching Walter and listening to the drum circles in the park, I have been hunting online to buy a Djembe. I love the rhythms and the African drum mixtures.If you can get past today's phobias and politically inspired hate and belligerencies, I'm sure you will love this movie.It's a winner.The Hobo Philosopher, Richard Edward Noble, is a writer and the author of ""Hobo-ing America.""",5,The Hobo Philosopher,1366416000,"04 20, 2013",2013,2238,"['MovieThe', 'VisitorReviewBy', 'Richard', 'Edward', 'NobleBecause', 'current', 'political', 'animosities', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'credit', 'Jenkins', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'main', 'character', 'Walter.He', 'college', 'professor', 'widower', 'clearly', 'very', 'lost', 'lonely', 'man', 'though', 'well', 'successful', 'academia', 'living', 'secure', 'existence.Walter', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'himself.He', 'totally', 'bored', 'life', 'career.We', 'are', 'never', 'introduced', 'deceased', 'wife', 'felt', 'strongly', 'Walter', 'lost', 'lonely', 'state.Walter', 'ordered', 'go', 'New', 'York', 'present', 'paper', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'write', 'paper', 'apartment', 'second', 'home', 'been', 'absent', 'years', 'peril', 'life', 'occupied.The', 'intruders', 'are', 'there', 'unaware', 'have', 'leased', 'apartment', 'illegally', 'Walter', 'explain', 'position', 'intruders', 'agree', 'leave.Walter', 'pity', 'relents', 'are', 'allowed', 'stay', 'can', 'find', 'new', 'apartment.Walter', 'then', 'guide', 'underworld', 'illegal', 'immigration', 'guests', 'are', 'here', 'U.S.', 'legal', 'permission', 'Via', 'Water', 'naivet', 'eacute', 'are', 'taken', 'tour', 'world', 'world.Walter', 'nothing', 'guests', 'situation', 'third', 'world', 'first', 'world', 'nation.Walter', 'melancholy', 'yet', 'excitement', 'viewer', 'are', 'led', 'intrigue', 'acting', 'superb.The', 'story', 'real', 'honest', 'heart', 'rendering.This', 'great', 'movie', 'have', 'watched', 'twice', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'future.I', 'was', 'able', 'associate', 'character', 'movie.I', 'have', 'even', 'been', 'inspired', 'Walter', 'musical', 'aspirations', 'am', 'amateur', 'jazz', 'drummer', 'watching', 'Walter', 'listening', 'drum', 'circles', 'park', 'have', 'been', 'hunting', 'online', 'buy', 'Djembe', 'love', 'rhythms', 'African', 'drum', 'mixtures.If', 'can', 'get', 'past', 'today', 'phobias', 'politically', 'inspired', 'hate', 'belligerencies', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'love', 'movie.It', 'winner.The', 'Hobo', 'Philosopher', 'Richard', 'Edward', 'Noble', 'writer', 'author', 'Hobo-ing', 'America']",N/A

Kyle,"[117, 128]","Dr. Walter Vale's (Richard Jenkins) not interested in going to New York City to present a paper at a conference to help a fellow colleague and co-author.  His own life takes precedence. Unfortunately, his dean doesn't see it that way.When he arrives in New York, he discovers that someone's bathing in his tub.  That would be Zainab (Danai Jekesai Gurira), a young Senegalese woman who is as surprised to see him as he is her.  The person sleeping in one of his beds is Tarek (Haaz Sleiman), a young Syrian man who sublet Vale's neglected apartment from a person that Vale doesn't even know.Vale cannot turn the pair out into the street, so he allows them to remain. As their acquaintance grows, Vale learns how to play the djembe from Tarek and  also the plight of illegal aliens--particularly Muslim ones, post 9/11 after Tarek is erroneously arrested in the subway over jumping the turnstile.One of the most heartbreaking scenes in this movie is when Vale takes Zaineb and Tarek's mother Moona (Hiam Abbass) to Staten Island. The women, who are both illegal, see the Statue of Liberty in all her glory. Zaineb relates how Tarek, who is now in detention, used to ride the ferry and jump up and down every time Lady Liberty came in sight pretending it was the first time to be in America.Vale, who'd failed piano lessons four times, learns there's music in everyone's soul.  If you can't play the piano, move on to another instrument until you find one whose music is in sync with your own rhythm.My husband and I left ""The Visitor"" wishing there was more, hoping that there was a good outcome for the characters.

1150181,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0015OKWKI,RMurray847,"[0, 0]","Someone please give Richard Jenkins an Oscar nomination!  He's done such great, understated work over the years, whether in dramatic roles (NORTH COUNTRY) or in broad comedies (BURN AFTER READING).  He's an amazing actor, because he always seems like a real person that you might actually meet in real life.  (Well, maybe not in STEP-BROTHERS, where no one behaved like a human.)  He's got a craggy face and an a normal physique.  Yet, as we saw in SIX FEET UNDER, he can peel back layer after layer of big surprises.In THE VISITOR, Richard Jenkins gets a role that was simply made for him.  He's cast as the lead, and he takes this unfamiliar burden (he is in every scene of the film) and brings it home with quiet power.  It's a well-written and directed film from Tom McCarthy (who also served those roles for the excellent THE STATION AGENT), but without Jenkins, I'm not sure the film would have been the success it was.Jenkins plays a widowed college professor who has long since given up on finding meaning in his work and life.  He's clearly bored with teaching, no longer writes and is basically coasting through life making as little impact on anything as possible.  He's actually trying to learn to play the piano, but is clearly frustrated with the rigidness this demands.Much to his chagrin, he's forced to leave his Connecticut home to present a paper at NYU.  He returns to his seldom visited New York City apartment, only to find a young couple are unwittingly squatting there.  They've been paying rent to the person they THOUGHT owned the place.  Jenkins initially accepts their offer to leave, but in a tiny burst of humanity or sympathy, he tells them they can stay for awhile.  The young man is an immigrant from Syria, a musician who plays the Djembe, an African drum somewhat akin to a bongo.  The young lady, his girlfriend, is an immigrant from Syria.  They are a poor but very committed couple.Jenkins finds himself drawn to the Djembe, and when the young Syrian catches Jenkins in the act of beating on it, his face brightens and he eagerly takes on his new pupil.  Jenkins takes to the drum with a type of joy you have to see to believe.  Here's an older professor, as uptight as can be, enveloped by years of sadness and boredom.  It's not like he suddenly bursts into manic life.  His awakening is gentle and slow...yet no less profound for its quietness.  The two men forge a friendship of sorts, and actually begin playing some in public in the park.  Coming home from this ""concert"", the young man accidentally snags his Djembe on the subway turnstile, and leads the subway cops to think he has jumped the turnstile.  He is arrested, and it is then that we discover (as we might have guessed anyway) that he is NOT in the country legally.At this point, the film is trying very hard to make itself about the American immigration system.  And not surprisingly, it is advocating for a more open system.  I'll try to keep my politics out of the review...because for me, these issues continued to be secondary to watching the relationships between Jenkins and his new friends.  Eventually, the mother of the detainee comes to town, and she and Jenkins forge a very convincing relationship...which I will say no more about.  In fact, that's it for revealing the plot, because it does take a few turns.The movie is full of heartbreak, but it is even more full of redemption.  The power of the music is made almost palpable.  We see Jenkins tapping his feet or keeping a beat with his fingers without even knowing it.  He is transformed, yes, by his new friendships...but also by the discovery that he can actually make music.Writer McCarthy has created an ""ordinary"" guy and fashioned for him a unique and unforgettable personal journey.  Yes, the plight of the ""illegal"" immigrant is illustrated (at least it doesn't get TOO preachy)...but trust me, the growth of these characters and relationships is what you will remember about this powerful little film.  While I've dwelt on Jenkins so much, let me just say that EVERYONE in the film is excellent.  What a great group of people to spend 104 minutes with!While overall it may not be the best film of the year (although it might be)...the performance from Richard Jenkins may be one of the two or three best I've seen by a leading man this year (add Brendan Gleeson from IN BRUGES and just for fun, Robert Downey Jr. for IRON MAN).

All four of the principal actors were great, and all four demonstrated nuances depictions of their characters.  This is a charming thoughtful movie and for those seeking to reflect on new paths, this movie works.What scared me, what stayed with me from this movie, was the arrogance and power of law enforcement.  Today they might apply this arrogance and power to illegals, but tomorrow it could be you or me.  9-11 had created an out of control omonster bureaucracy, and as Obama and the extreme left seek to disarm America, while continuing to support the Hailiburton prison camps ordered up by the Bush Administration, it is easy to see why the Founding Fathers felt that the right to bear arms was such an essential aspect of keeping a Republic whole.Now (as of 14 August 2009) there is talk of ""federalizing"" the police across America so as to give the federal government more power to suppress localized dissent.

1150184,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B0015OKWKI,Robert J. Crawford,"[1, 2]","This is a wonderful look into the lives of several illegal immigrants.  They are trying to make it in the US, just like virtually all of our ancestors did.  In this film, their situation, with its insecurity and hope, is deeply compelling.  That they are also Muslims facing prejudice and fear is an additional layer of interest.  To its credit, the film shows the charming side of Islamic culture better than any recent film treatment that I have seen - I know this charm from direct experience via work and travel.The plot of the film is also fun and clever.  A prof, grieving the loss of his wife and burnt out in his job, discovers a couple living in his apartment.  They had been scammed, as immigrants often are.  Out of sympathy, he offers to let them stay while they wort their situation out, in the process getting to know them.  The young man, who has a striking charisma to him, befriends the prof and brings him into his music world, re-igniting a smoldering passion  for music that this outwardly square man has hidden.  They begin playing bongos in the subway together and you believe it!When events take a tragic turn, the young man's mother shows up.  Though middle-aged and care worn, she too has a grace and quiet charisma to her, a beauty that radiates from within.  The prof learns more about the family and in a way falls for the mother, which is portrayed with a subtlety of emotion that is extremely rare in American films, though of course this is an indy film.At this time when immigration is a political issue dominated by demagogues, this lovely film could help us to regain our empathy.

1150186,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0015OKWKI,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 2]","""The Visitor"" is an exquisitely realized drama about an aging economics professor who receives a brand new lease on life.  Still grieving over the loss of his beloved wife, Walter Vale is a man who has taken to pretty much coasting through life, teaching the same mind-numbing courses semester after semester and  ""co-authoring"" a book that he knows little about due to the fact that he didn't actually do much to help write it. As the movie begins, Walter is sent by the New England college where he works to deliver a speech on that book at a conference in Manhattan.  When he arrives in the city, Walter is shocked to discover two illegal immigrants - a man from Syria and a woman from Senegal - living in the apartment he owns there (a friend of the couple having tricked them into believing that HE was the actual owner).  After some initial confusion and embarrassment occasioned by the misunderstanding, a warm relationship develops between Walter and the young man, Tarek, who repays Walter's kindness in allowing them to stay in the apartment by teaching him how to play the djimbe, a hand drum of West African origin.  Soon, however, Tarek finds himself in trouble with the immigration department which wants to deport Tarek back to his country of origin.  Moved by the plight confronting his new friend, Walter becomes the young man's chief advocate on the outside, trying to secure legal help for him and doing what he can to support Tarek`s understandably distraught mother and girlfriend through the crisis.A barebones detailing like the one above could never hope to do full justice to the wonderful work of art that writer/director Thomas McCarthy (""The Station Agent"") has wrought from this material.  For what starts off as a story about one man's emotional and spiritual reconnection to life broadens out to become a heartbreaking look at the immigrant experience and the melting pot richness of American society.  Giving what is clearly one of the most beautifully controlled and thoughtful performances in recent memory, Richard Jenkins takes charge of the film from the very opening frame and never lets go, ever so subtly drawing us into the life and mind of this complex but genuinely decent man who finally finds something outside of his own humdrum existence worth caring about.  Devoid of histrionic flourishes of any kind, Jenkins' sensitive and understated performance becomes the perfect vehicle to guide us through this narrative.Equally impressive are the three main supporting actors who contribute greatly to the emotional richness of the piece.  The engaging and charismatic quality Haaz Sleiman brings to the part of Tarek is crucial in making us understand just how it is that Walter is willing to go to bat for a man he has known for only a few days (and how refreshing it is to have an Arab character who is NOT an actual terrorist for a change!).  As Tarek's young Senegalese lover, Danai Jekesai Gurira undergoes a radical transformation throughout the course of her performance, playing a woman who is at first taciturn and suspicious through a learned sense of caution - then openhearted and giving once she realizes her suspicions about Walter are thoroughly without merit.  But it is Hiam Abbass who most captures our heart as Tarek's mother, a woman who believes fervently in the promise of the American Dream, but who knows only too well that, for some people, that dream can quickly turn into a gut-wrenching legal and bureaucratic nightmare, particularly in the post 9/11 world in which we now live.""The Visitor"" plays like a delicately calibrated piece of music, with each element falling seamlessly into place to achieve its overall effect.  McCarthy's direction is sinewy and lyrical, while Oliver Bokelberg's cinematography bathes the film in a warmly lit, hue-filled glow.  The movie also captivates us with its view of an eclectic, multi-cultural urban landscape - one filled with the sights and sounds of a city alive to the possibility of human harmony and achievement in all its myriad diversity and richness.Beyond being a superb human drama in its own right, ""The Visitor"" is also quite possibly the most artful and moving film about immigration to have come our way since ""El Norte"" - and every bit as remarkable.",5,a work of art,1234742400,"02 16, 2009",2009,4274,"['Visitor', 'exquisitely', 'realized', 'drama', 'aging', 'economics', 'professor', 'who', 'brand', 'new', 'lease', 'life', 'Still', 'grieving', 'loss', 'beloved', 'wife', 'Walter', 'Vale', 'man', 'who', 'taken', 'pretty', 'much', 'coasting', 'life', 'teaching', 'same', 'mind-numbing', 'courses', 'semester', 'semester', 'co-authoring', 'book', 'little', 'due', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'do', 'much', 'help', 'write', 'movie', 'Walter', 'sent', 'New', 'England', 'college', 'where', 'deliver', 'speech', 'book', 'conference', 'Manhattan', 'When', 'city', 'Walter', 'shocked', 'discover', 'two', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'man', 'Syria', 'woman', 'Senegal', 'living', 'apartment', 'there', 'friend', 'couple', 'having', 'tricked', 'believing', 'HE', 'was', 'actual', 'owner', 'initial', 'confusion', 'embarrassment', 'occasioned', 'misunderstanding', 'warm', 'relationship', 'Walter', 'young', 'man', 'Tarek', 'who', 'Walter', 'kindness', 'allowing', 'stay', 'apartment', 'teaching', 'how', 'play', 'djimbe', 'hand', 'drum', 'West', 'African', 'origin', 'Soon', 'however', 'Tarek', 'trouble', 'immigration', 'department', 'deport', 'Tarek', 'back', 'country', 'origin', 'Moved', 'plight', 'confronting', 'new', 'friend', 'Walter', 'young', 'man', 'chief', 'advocate', 'outside', 'trying', 'secure', 'legal', 'help', 'doing', 'what', 'can', 'support', 'Tarek', 's', 'understandably', 'distraught', 'mother', 'girlfriend', 'crisis.A', 'detailing', 'one', 'above', 'could', 'never', 'hope', 'do', 'full', 'justice', 'wonderful', 'work', 'art', 'writer/director', 'Thomas', 'McCarthy', 'Station', 'Agent', 'wrought', 'material', 'what', 'off', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'emotional', 'spiritual', 'reconnection', 'life', 'broadens', 'out', 'become', 'heartbreaking', 'look', 'immigrant', 'experience', 'melting', 'pot', 'richness', 'American', 'society', 'Giving', 'what', 'clearly', 'one', 'most', 'beautifully', 'controlled', 'thoughtful', 'performances', 'recent', 'memory', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'charge', 'film', 'very', 'opening', 'frame', 'never', 'lets', 'go', 'ever', 'so', 'subtly', 'drawing', 'life', 'mind', 'complex', 'genuinely', 'decent', 'man', 'who', 'finally', 'something', 'own', 'humdrum', 'existence', 'caring', 'about', 'Devoid', 'histrionic', 'flourishes', 'kind', 'Jenkins', 'sensitive', 'understated', 'performance', 'perfect', 'vehicle', 'guide', 'narrative.Equally', 'impressive', 'are', 'three', 'main', 'supporting', 'actors', 'who', 'contribute', 'greatly', 'emotional', 'richness', 'piece', 'engaging', 'charismatic', 'quality', 'Haaz', 'Sleiman', 'part', 'Tarek', 'crucial', 'making', 'understand', 'just', 'how', 'Walter', 'willing', 'go', 'bat', 'man', 'known', 'only', 'few', 'days', 'how', 'refreshing', 'have', 'Arab', 'character', 'who', 'NOT', 'actual', 'terrorist', 'change', 'Tarek', 'young', 'Senegalese', 'lover', 'Danai', 'Jekesai', 'Gurira', 'radical', 'transformation', 'course', 'performance', 'playing', 'woman', 'who', 'first', 'taciturn', 'suspicious', 'learned', 'sense', 'caution', 'then', 'openhearted', 'giving', 'once', 'suspicions', 'Walter', 'are', 'thoroughly', 'merit', 'Hiam', 'Abbass', 'who', 'most', 'captures', 'heart', 'Tarek', 'mother', 'woman', 'who', 'fervently', 'promise', 'American', 'Dream', 'who', 'only', 'too', 'well', 'people', 'dream', 'can', 'quickly', 'turn', 'gut-wrenching', 'legal', 'bureaucratic', 'nightmare', 'particularly', 'post', '9/11', 'world', 'now', 'live', 'Visitor', 'delicately', 'calibrated', 'piece', 'music', 'element', 'falling', 'seamlessly', 'place', 'achieve', 'overall', 'effect', 'McCarthy', 'direction', 'sinewy', 'lyrical', 'Oliver', 'Bokelberg', 'cinematography', 'film', 'warmly', 'lit', 'hue-filled', 'glow', 'movie', 'also', 'view', 'eclectic', 'multi-cultural', 'urban', 'landscape', 'one', 'filled', 'sights', 'sounds', 'city', 'alive', 'possibility', 'human', 'harmony', 'achievement', 'myriad', 'diversity', 'richness.Beyond', 'being', 'superb', 'human', 'drama', 'own', 'right', 'Visitor', 'also', 'quite', 'possibly', 'most', 'artful', 'moving', 'film', 'immigration', 'have', 'come', 'way', 'El', 'Norte', 'bit', 'remarkable']",N/A
1150187,A1JEFESGLIS076,B0015OKWKI,rsoonsa,"[6, 29]","It is indeed gratifying that veteran and highly skilled supporting player Richard Jenkins is given the lead for this film.  It is additionally unfortunate that the work is not so much a drama as it is a polemic espousing the cause of immigrants illegally residing within the United States, with virtual sermons upon the subject comprising a portion of the dialogue.  If one hasn't a theoretic point of view allied with that of the production team, its quality of didacticism may appear to be a trifle starry-eyed.  Jenkins plays as Walter Vale, a somewhat fuddled college professor whose work ethic has gradually disappeared, and who has failed at attempts at adapting to the death of his wife six years past, the role as bromidic as are those of the other major characters, and of the Forces of Evil, essentially depicted here by United States immigration officials.  A viewer's life experience may have led to a conclusion that most college and university professors are not quite as softheaded as Vale, particularly in light of his ostensible incompetence, regardless of political positioning, and notably when removed from the groves of academe.  Yet Jenkins, thanks to his acting expertise, makes Vale all asea by life in general, although he does rivet upon learning to pound atop the djembe, a type of African drum, even to the point of demonstrating his newly developed musical talent in a highly public place.  This represents a remarkable personality shift for the formerly bloodless Walter, he having received a transfusion of vitality from his illegally situated new friends, and is perhaps the film's silliest episode.  Most of the work, however, is too self-consciously serious to permit such dottiness.  Performances by the cast are uniformly well-created throughout, and while most of the featured actors will probably be seldom seen after this, the familiar face of Jenkins will undoubtedly be screened often, once again in supporting roles, a status that some viewers might prefer after seeing this piece.

1150190,A1K94LXX833JTT,B0015OKWKI,Sanpete,"[7, 8]","This is a quiet, intensely felt and well observed film about how chance and small choices lead to life changes, happy and sad.  It's about very different people being thrown together.  It's about a husk of a man being drawn back into life.Oh, and it has a political element about immigration.  If you think that may bother you, please read on--you have no real cause for worry.  No political view was harmed in the making of this movie.Walter (Richard Jenkins) is a 62-year-old economics professor who is drained of life.  He takes piano lessons, perhaps in a vain effort to connect somehow with his deceased pianist wife, but he has no great talent and gets no joy from it; he teaches a class, but no one enjoys that; he doesn't really work on his book.A chance occurrence takes Walter from his home in Connecticut to his apartment in New York City where, in an unexpectedly generous moment (which makes sense as presented), he gives place to two young immigrants, Tarek (Haaz Sleiman), a man from Syria who makes his living playing the djembe (an African drum), and girlfriend Zainab (Danai Gurira), a jewelry maker from Senegal.  Walter is drawn in by Tarek's drum and sunny open-heartedness, finding in the more elemental spirit of the drum what he lacked with the piano.  As Tarek teaches him to play, the juices of life begin to flow again.Another chance occurrence lands Tarek in a detention center for undocumented immigrants.  From this point, about halfway into the film, the treatment of illegal immigrants becomes a theme.  This brings Tarek's mother, Mouna (Hiam Abbass) into the picture, whose presence furthers Walter's revival.It may seem strange to say, but the political theme about the treatment of illegal immigrants, especially those from the Muslim world post September 11th, is one-sided but not unfair.  That is, because of the point of view of the movie, Walter's point of view, we only see a small part of the complex issues relating to immigration.  What we do see is presented accurately, without blaming anyone; there are no villains; no political stance or attitude is made to look bad; no hint of a political program is suggested as to how to deal with illegal immigrants.  This country, and New York City in particular, is presented as a vibrant, desirable place.  The only political act is to give the immigrant a sympathetic human face, and to show how implacable and dehumanized the immigration system can be.The role of Walter was written for Jenkins, who was nominated for an Oscar for it--quite an accomplishment for a small, non-Hollywood film.  He starts off cold and doing some unsympathetic things, yet he manages to capture our sympathy.  I was especially impressed by Sleiman's perfectly natural and irresistible Tarek.  He makes not only his own role believable, but everyone else's--it's easy to see why others would interact with him as they do.  And I was struck by the understated beauty and power of Abbass, as Tarek's mother.  It's a pleasure just to see her on screen.  The other main role, Gurira's Zainab, is also drawn most effectively.Writer/director Tom McCarthy, who is an actor himself, called on a lot of fine actors to play the small roles, so every character is interesting and engaging.The audio commentary with McCarthy and Jenkins focuses mostly on how the film was made, with only the occasional remark about the meaning.  I found it interesting, but I learned more about the ideas behind and in the film in some of the many interviews with McCarthy and Jenkins I found online.  The Inside Look featurette is short and slight; the deleted scenes are also brief, but add a bit.  The featurette on playing the djembe includes interviews with the man who taught Sleiman, Jenkins and, before that, McCarthy himself to play, along with input from the actors.One point that came up in many interviews I read, but is only barely touched on in the audio commentary, is the meaning of the title.  So as not to spoil anything I'll just suggest that it has many meanings through the film, so don't be stingy in applying it wherever it seems to fit.This film is a treat for those who like character studies, especially ones that focus on the struggles, triumphs and losses of ordinary, basically good people.  It won't give anything away to say that the ending is both heartbreaking and hopeful.  Like the best movies of its kind, it made me feel more deeply who I am and what it is to be human.",5,Visitations to life,1228435200,"12 5, 2008",2008,4449,"['quiet', 'intensely', 'felt', 'well', 'observed', 'film', 'how', 'chance', 'small', 'choices', 'lead', 'life', 'changes', 'happy', 'sad', 'about', 'very', 'different', 'people', 'being', 'thrown', 'together', 'husk', 'man', 'being', 'drawn', 'back', 'life.Oh', 'political', 'element', 'immigration', 'think', 'may', 'bother', 'please', 'read', 'have', 'real', 'cause', 'worry', 'political', 'view', 'was', 'harmed', 'making', 'movie.Walter', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', '62-year-old', 'economics', 'professor', 'who', 'drained', 'life', 'piano', 'lessons', 'perhaps', 'vain', 'effort', 'connect', 'somehow', 'deceased', 'pianist', 'wife', 'great', 'talent', 'joy', 'class', 'one', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'book.A', 'chance', 'occurrence', 'Walter', 'home', 'Connecticut', 'apartment', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'where', 'unexpectedly', 'generous', 'moment', 'sense', 'presented', 'place', 'two', 'young', 'immigrants', 'Tarek', 'Haaz', 'Sleiman', 'man', 'Syria', 'who', 'living', 'playing', 'djembe', 'African', 'drum', 'girlfriend', 'Zainab', 'Danai', 'Gurira', 'jewelry', 'maker', 'Senegal', 'Walter', 'drawn', 'Tarek', 'drum', 'sunny', 'open-heartedness', 'finding', 'more', 'elemental', 'spirit', 'drum', 'what', 'lacked', 'piano', 'Tarek', 'play', 'juices', 'life', 'begin', 'flow', 'again.Another', 'chance', 'occurrence', 'Tarek', 'detention', 'center', 'undocumented', 'immigrants', 'point', 'halfway', 'film', 'treatment', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'theme', 'Tarek', 'mother', 'Mouna', 'Hiam', 'Abbass', 'picture', 'presence', 'furthers', 'Walter', 'revival.It', 'may', 'seem', 'strange', 'say', 'political', 'theme', 'treatment', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'especially', 'Muslim', 'world', 'post', 'September', '11th', 'one-sided', 'not', 'unfair', 'point', 'view', 'movie', 'Walter', 'point', 'view', 'only', 'see', 'small', 'part', 'complex', 'issues', 'relating', 'immigration', 'What', 'do', 'see', 'presented', 'accurately', 'blaming', 'anyone', 'are', 'villains', 'political', 'stance', 'attitude', 'made', 'look', 'bad', 'hint', 'political', 'program', 'suggested', 'how', 'deal', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'country', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'particular', 'presented', 'vibrant', 'desirable', 'place', 'only', 'political', 'act', 'give', 'immigrant', 'sympathetic', 'human', 'face', 'show', 'how', 'implacable', 'dehumanized', 'immigration', 'system', 'can', 'be.The', 'role', 'Walter', 'was', 'written', 'Jenkins', 'who', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'quite', 'accomplishment', 'small', 'non-Hollywood', 'film', 'cold', 'doing', 'unsympathetic', 'things', 'yet', 'capture', 'sympathy', 'was', 'especially', 'impressed', 'Sleiman', 'perfectly', 'natural', 'irresistible', 'Tarek', 'not', 'only', 'own', 'role', 'believable', 'everyone', 'else', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'others', 'would', 'interact', 'do', 'was', 'struck', 'understated', 'beauty', 'power', 'Abbass', 'Tarek', 'mother', 'pleasure', 'just', 'see', 'screen', 'other', 'main', 'role', 'Gurira', 'Zainab', 'also', 'drawn', 'most', 'effectively.Writer/director', 'Tom', 'McCarthy', 'who', 'actor', 'called', 'lot', 'fine', 'actors', 'play', 'small', 'roles', 'so', 'character', 'interesting', 'engaging.The', 'audio', 'commentary', 'McCarthy', 'Jenkins', 'mostly', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'only', 'occasional', 'remark', 'meaning', 'found', 'interesting', 'learned', 'more', 'ideas', 'film', 'many', 'interviews', 'McCarthy', 'Jenkins', 'found', 'online', 'Inside', 'Look', 'featurette', 'short', 'slight', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'brief', 'add', 'bit', 'featurette', 'playing', 'djembe', 'interviews', 'man', 'who', 'taught', 'Sleiman', 'Jenkins', 'McCarthy', 'play', 'input', 'actors.One', 'point', 'came', 'up', 'many', 'interviews', 'read', 'only', 'barely', 'touched', 'audio', 'commentary', 'meaning', 'title', 'So', 'not', 'spoil', 'anything', ""'ll"", 'just', 'suggest', 'many', 'meanings', 'film', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'stingy', 'applying', 'fit.This', 'film', 'treat', 'who', 'like', 'character', 'studies', 'especially', 'ones', 'focus', 'struggles', 'triumphs', 'losses', 'ordinary', 'basically', 'good', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'say', 'ending', 'heartbreaking', 'hopeful', 'best', 'movies', 'kind', 'made', 'feel', 'more', 'deeply', 'who', 'am', 'what', 'be', 'human']",N/A

I don't know if you can FIND either of these, but if you can, you must!) Sadly, when the studios died, so did the B units (as well as too much character acting talent). But, every so often we get a marvel like ""The Visitor"". It would not be accurate to say that Richard Jenkins is the best character actor on the planet, there are at least two or threee others I can think of who would give him a run for his money (Philip Baker Hall, Philip Seymour Hoffman... hey! Maybe Jenkins IS the best who has only two names, neither of which is Philip), but he IS one of that small happy breed who seems incapable of giving a bad or boring performance. And, when he is given the chance to carry a small, but greatly meaningful, dramedy, he does it with such aplomb that it makes you realise how hard say, Tom Cruise has to work for half the truth. Give him a couple of formidable co-stars like Hiam Abbass and Haaz Sleiman (haven't heard of them? You will!) and a superb script by writer/director Tom McCarthy, and you've got that rarest of animals... an adult movie of intelligence, wit, heart, and mind. And not a superhero in sight (although if Jenkins WANTED to play Spiderman, he probably could.)",4,"They Don't Make 'em Like This Anymore... but. sometimes, they do!",1224892800,"10 25, 2008",2008,1836,"['title', 'above', 'literally', 'true', 'movie', 'history', 'late', ""'30s"", '50s', 'major', 'studio', 'had', 'B', 'movie', 'unit', 'NO', 'not', 'what', 'think', 'was', ""n't"", 'unit', 'devoted', 'exclusively', 'cheap', 'crime/sci-fi', 'movies', 'was', 'certainly', 'part', 'output', 'What', 'B', 'units', 'produced', 'were', 'low-budget', 'small', 'films', 'EVERY', 'kind', 'one', 'real', 'treasures', 'B', 'history', 'was', 'when', 'company', 'would', 'raise', 'one', 'character', 'actors', 'star', 'status', 'cinematic', 'moment', 'time', 'was', 'type', 'thinking', 'got', 'such', 'gems', 'Victor', 'Moore', 'Beulah', 'Bondi', 'Make', 'Way', 'Tomorrow', 'Dan', 'Duryea', 'Chicago', 'Calling', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'can', 'FIND', 'can', 'must', 'Sadly', 'when', 'studios', 'died', 'so', 'did', 'B', 'units', 'as', 'well', 'too', 'much', 'character', 'acting', 'talent', 'so', 'often', 'get', 'marvel', 'Visitor', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'accurate', 'say', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'best', 'character', 'actor', 'planet', 'are', 'least', 'two', 'threee', 'others', 'can', 'think', 'who', 'would', 'give', 'run', 'money', 'Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'hey', 'Maybe', 'Jenkins', 'best', 'who', 'only', 'two', 'names', 'Philip', 'one', 'small', 'happy', 'breed', 'who', 'incapable', 'giving', 'bad', 'boring', 'performance', 'when', 'given', 'chance', 'carry', 'small', 'greatly', 'meaningful', 'dramedy', 'such', 'aplomb', 'realise', 'how', 'hard', 'say', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'work', 'truth', 'Give', 'couple', 'formidable', 'co-stars', 'Hiam', 'Abbass', 'Haaz', 'Sleiman', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'will', 'superb', 'script', 'writer/director', 'Tom', 'McCarthy', ""'ve"", 'got', 'rarest', 'animals', 'adult', 'movie', 'intelligence', 'wit', 'heart', 'mind', 'not', 'superhero', 'sight', 'Jenkins', 'WANTED', 'play', 'Spiderman', 'probably', 'could']",N/A

Just your typical mid life crisis, but about ten years after he should have grown out of it.All that changes when he has to go to a conference in New York City and a couple has taken up residence in his apartment there in his absence. Instead of calling the police like a normal person, Jenkins, longing for some human contact out of the norm and let the two Muslims stay. In Haaz Sleiman (American Dreamz), Jenkins finds a teacher that doesn't just dismiss him learning the djembe (a Syrian drum) at such an old age.This first half of the film is as exhilarating as Jenkins taking up the foreign instrument with plenty of great music that moves the movie along.

Imagine his surprise upon--returning to New York for an academic conference--he finds a young, foreign couple living in his flat.  After a few tense moments that may burst into violence, things calm down, and it becomes clear that Takek and Zaineb have been rented the vacant apartment by a third party under false pretences.  They don't want any trouble, and agree to leave immediately.Quickly enough, the good-hearted Walter feels badly about throwing them out on the street.  He chases them down and invites them to come back for a few days until they can find a place to stay.  So begins a friendship and a relationship that may change the lives of all involved.Zainab is Senegalese and reserved.  Tarek, on the other hand is Syrian, outgoing, and always ready with a smile.  He is a professional drummer, and he and Walter discover an affinity for percussion.  There is more to Walter than his button-down exterior.  After a lesson in Central Park, Walter and Takek are returning home when a minor misunderstanding leads to Tarek's arrest.

1150202,A19DW3VKM5KKYB,B0015OKWKI,TheBandit,"[11, 22]","I'm in two minds regarding Thomas McCarthy's ""The Visitor.""  On one hand, the movie is a very well-acted, low-key character drama.  On the other hand, I found the blatant political agenda intolerable in its one-sidedness.Richard Jenkins plays college professor Walter Vale.  Walter returns to his New York City apartment for the first time in months to find - to his understandable shock - a young couple has taken up residence there.  An unscrupulous landlord has rented out Walter's fully furnished apartment as if it were a vacant unit.  Rather than turn the couple out on the streets - something the man and woman are willing and ready to do - Walter allows them to share the place with him.  The man is from Syria and the woman from Senegal.Walter is a complex and carefully drawn character.  His pianist wife has passed away sometime in the recent past, and he has become a frustrated musician - trying to learn piano as a way to remain connected to her.  He is coasting in most areas of his life.  As a tenured professor, he barely puts any effort into his job.  He is emotionally closed off and quite miserable in general.  But something about the plight of this young immigrant couple stirs a compassionate part of him that has been dormant for sometime.  He makes it his mission to be as generous as possible in helping these people.Turns out that the couple are illegal aliens.  They are fully aware of the risks.  Both are intelligent and educated.  Both are creative artists (the girl creates jewelry to sell, the man is a percussionist who performs regularly).  Neither have any criminal background.  But Tarek, the Syrian man, has ignored the procedures that could have established a legal right to be in the country.  His mother is illegal as well, and she is largely responsible for Tarek's plight - having taken the poor advice of other illegals with blatant disregard for the immigration process.Before anyone gets the wrong idea, let me make it clear:  I fully support legal immigration to the United States, from anywhere else in the world.  I realize there are problems with the system as it presently operates.  And I detest the fact that so many businesses in the U.S. employ illegals and go unpunished.  I don't blame anyone for attempting to live, work, and raise their families in the greatest country on planet Earth.  I realize that many countries in the world are hellholes with oppressive regimes, and the problems within the U.S. pale by comparison.  There's nothing wrong with people trying to seek asylum here rather than have their human rights trampled in their own country.  But there are laws that should be followed as well.""The Visitor"" crosses the fine line, at least to some degree, between being a character-based piece of storytelling and political screed.  It is important to remember that people who live and work in the country without documentation are comitting a criminal act.  Not all of the millions of illegal aliens currently in the U.S. are productive contributors who mean no harm.  That's not to say they are all terrorists or all are lazy or all are violent criminals (though, of course, there are some that fall squarely into each category).  We have enough people meaning to either do harm to the U.S. in some way and/or drag down the economy via non-productivity that are LEGALLY entitled to be here.  Call me old-fashioned, but you can't just squat in the U.S. and expect to be considered an American.  You have to earn it, as so many million immigrants have done (and continue to do) over the years.""The Visitor"" carefully stacks the deck in such a way that it is virtually impossible not to feel great sympathy for Tarek, his girlfriend, and his mother.  But to me, it became a bit manipulative by presenting these characters as flawless.  I enjoyed the movie primarily for Jenkins excellent work as he shows Walter reclaiming a sense of purpose for his life.

1150203,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B0015OKWKI,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[25, 27]","With a highly inventive introduction to cheerfully mismatched characters, The Visitor is a daring look at the hopelessness of unfortunate immigration circumstances. Superbly acted and beautifully scored, the film doesn't back down from its touching subject matter and realistically tragic events, but instead infuses them with aptly-timed comic relief and the persuasive power of music and romance.Bitter and bored college professor Walter Vale (Richard Jenkins) travels to his New York apartment after being forced to attend a conference on global economization. Immediately he discovers a couple living in his home, and out of kindness and the appeal of company, he invites them to stay. Tarek Khalil (Haaz Sleiman) plays the drums, and soon gets the unsociable Walter to take up the instrument. Tarek's girlfriend Zainab is slower to acknowledge Walter's hospitality, but eventually warms to his presence.When Tarek is arrested at the subway and taken to a detention center for illegal immigrants, Walter shows estimable concern for his newfound friend. Weighing his teaching job back in Connecticut against helping a man he's known for less than two weeks, Walter hires a lawyer to aid in Tarek's release. When Mrs. Khalil arrives to find out what's happened to her son, Walter finds himself rediscovering romance as well as what is truly important in his life.Great care is taken to create sympathy for Tarek and Zainab, even though they are chiefly at fault for their uncertain positions. They've done nothing wrong in the eyes of the viewer, and its best that it stays that way - for the law they break is too complex to designate as morally right and wrong. The Visitor unflinchingly demonstrates the bleakness of their situation, and ensures that their story represents the likely majority of factual examples. The mocking sign ""Know Your Rights"" at the detention center foreshadows the unfortunate prejudices and consequences of an unsympathetic law. In the end, Walter's self-realization and inner revelations are the solace that must outshine his visitor's discouraging plights.Richard Jenkins' acting is phenomenal, even though his role is to remove a wide array of emotions from his weathered face. Offering many scenes of comedy relief and the amusing rediscovery of long-abandoned romance, Jenkins delivers a wholly believable character that is relatable and easily liked. His distaste for his work and his discontent with life gives his eventual recognition of purpose even more of a cinematic edge. And being a mismatched companion and an unlikely friend lends to further depth and appeal. Though Tarek and Zainab are the first visitors and Mrs. Khalil after that - truly Walter is the visitor to their world - one he was previously completely oblivious to.Part romance, part comedy and many parts drama, The Visitor presents moral conflict with the faceless evils of uncaring laws and heartfelt bonding between a weary, lonely man and a free-spirited musician. While the film slows in a few spots, the constant interjection of humor safely guarantees that audiences won't lose interest. The Visitor is an uncommonly sincere film that manages to mix harsh realism with crowd-pleasing entertainment.- Mike Massie",4,The Visitor Movie Review,1207267200,"04 4, 2008",2008,3229,"['highly', 'inventive', 'introduction', 'cheerfully', 'mismatched', 'characters', 'Visitor', 'daring', 'look', 'hopelessness', 'unfortunate', 'immigration', 'circumstances', 'Superbly', 'acted', 'beautifully', 'scored', 'film', ""n't"", 'back', 'down', 'touching', 'subject', 'matter', 'realistically', 'tragic', 'events', 'instead', 'aptly-timed', 'comic', 'relief', 'persuasive', 'power', 'music', 'romance.Bitter', 'bored', 'college', 'professor', 'Walter', 'Vale', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'New', 'York', 'apartment', 'being', 'forced', 'attend', 'conference', 'global', 'economization', 'Immediately', 'couple', 'living', 'home', 'kindness', 'appeal', 'company', 'stay', 'Tarek', 'Khalil', 'Haaz', 'Sleiman', 'drums', 'soon', 'unsociable', 'Walter', 'take', 'up', 'instrument', 'Tarek', 'girlfriend', 'Zainab', 'slower', 'acknowledge', 'Walter', 'hospitality', 'eventually', 'warms', 'presence.When', 'Tarek', 'arrested', 'subway', 'taken', 'detention', 'center', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'Walter', 'estimable', 'concern', 'newfound', 'friend', 'Weighing', 'teaching', 'job', 'back', 'Connecticut', 'helping', 'man', 'known', 'less', 'two', 'weeks', 'Walter', 'lawyer', 'aid', 'Tarek', 'release', 'When', 'Mrs.', 'Khalil', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'son', 'Walter', 'rediscovering', 'romance', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'truly', 'important', 'life.Great', 'care', 'taken', 'create', 'sympathy', 'Tarek', 'Zainab', 'even', 'are', 'chiefly', 'fault', 'uncertain', 'positions', ""'ve"", 'done', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'eyes', 'viewer', 'best', 'way', 'law', 'break', 'too', 'complex', 'designate', 'morally', 'right', 'wrong', 'Visitor', 'unflinchingly', 'bleakness', 'situation', 'story', 'likely', 'majority', 'factual', 'examples', 'mocking', 'sign', 'Know', 'Your', 'Rights', 'detention', 'center', 'unfortunate', 'prejudices', 'consequences', 'unsympathetic', 'law', 'end', 'Walter', 'self-realization', 'inner', 'revelations', 'are', 'solace', 'must', 'outshine', 'visitor', 'discouraging', 'plights.Richard', 'Jenkins', 'acting', 'phenomenal', 'even', 'role', 'remove', 'wide', 'array', 'emotions', 'weathered', 'face', 'Offering', 'many', 'scenes', 'comedy', 'relief', 'amusing', 'rediscovery', 'long-abandoned', 'romance', 'Jenkins', 'wholly', 'believable', 'character', 'relatable', 'easily', 'liked', 'distaste', 'work', 'discontent', 'life', 'eventual', 'recognition', 'purpose', 'even', 'more', 'cinematic', 'edge', 'being', 'mismatched', 'companion', 'unlikely', 'friend', 'further', 'depth', 'appeal', 'Tarek', 'Zainab', 'are', 'first', 'visitors', 'Mrs.', 'Khalil', 'truly', 'Walter', 'visitor', 'world', 'one', 'was', 'previously', 'completely', 'oblivious', 'to.Part', 'romance', 'part', 'comedy', 'many', 'parts', 'drama', 'Visitor', 'moral', 'conflict', 'faceless', 'evils', 'uncaring', 'laws', 'heartfelt', 'bonding', 'weary', 'lonely', 'man', 'free-spirited', 'musician', 'film', 'few', 'spots', 'constant', 'interjection', 'humor', 'safely', 'audiences', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lose', 'interest', 'Visitor', 'uncommonly', 'sincere', 'film', 'mix', 'harsh', 'realism', 'crowd-pleasing', 'entertainment.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",N/A

But I am sure that without this veteran actor the film would be yet another well-intentioned but mediocre independent film. As it is, ""The Visitor"" is an intriguing drama and Richard Jenkins is very good as tired college professor Walter Vale who, in his own words, just ""pretends.""A widowed college professor Walter Vale (Richard Jenkins) currently living in Connecticut travels to New York City to attend an academic conference, which, it is obvious, he is not interested. To his great surprise, Walter finds two persons are living in his old apartment, unbeknown to Walter. They are a young Syrian musician Tarek Khalil (Haaz Sleiman) and his girlfriend from Senegal Zainab (Danai Jekesai Gurira) and apparently Tarek and Zainab are led to believe they are really renting the rooms.Tarek and Zainab leave the professor's room, but they have nowhere to go. Being a good man at heart, Walter lets Tarek and Zainab stay. An unlikely friendship is born when Walter starts to learn djembe, an African hand drum Tarek loves to play.Thomas McCarthy's second film deals with such important issues as immigration (post 9/11 particularly) and consequently it is partly political. Though the director tries not to show it overtly, it becomes evident where his heart truly lies.But ""The Visitor"" succeeds most as a character-driven drama and most interesting character appears later in the film: Tarek's mother Mouna who is thoughtful and determined, played brilliantly by Hiam Abbass (""The Syrian Bride"").

1150208,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B0015OKWKI,Turfseer,"[9, 20]","Warning: This review may contains spoilers--If you think back at your time in college, how many professors were like Walter Vale, The Visitor's main character? How many were so depressed that they felt that they were only going through the motions in life? Most of the professors I knew had pretty big egos--they enjoyed imparting information to their students and promulgating a philosophy of life they believed in. Why is this particular professor so cut off from his emotions? Was it the death of his wife? His humdrum routine at the college? Writer/director Thomas McCarthy has created a character so extreme in his detachment that he doesn't seem real. Vale's detachment is not due to anger but rather he is a symbol of what McCarthy perceives as a malaise in Western Culture.Vale (the symbol) lacks one ingredient that can make him a self-actualized person. And that is spontaneity. Certainly his superiors up at the college and colleagues at the NYU development conference he attends don't have the spontaneity that will turn them into more alive (and better) people. The only people who can redeem the robotic Vale are the spontaneous, 'life-affirming' illegal immigrants who come into Vale's life and act as the catalyst for his self-redemption.The ego-less and sad-sack Vale fails to call the police immediately when he finds Tarek and Zainab, the Syrian-Palestianian and Sengalese illegal immigrants, illegally squatting in his apartment. Out of the goodness of his heart, Tarek (with Zainab's loving support) will teach Dr. Vale how to become a 'cool' guy. He accomplishes this by instructing Vale in the art of West African drumming.McCarthy would be remiss if he did not throw a few antagonists into the mix. First, it's a bunch of mean undercover cops at the Central Park West/W. 72nd Street subway station who arrest Tarek for fare beating (even though they could have clearly seen he went through the turnstile AFTER paying the fare with his Metrocard). Worse villains emerge with the faceless Immigration and Custom Enforcement Agents who imprison Tarek in a Federal detention facility and threaten to deport him.Soon afterward, Tarek's mother, Mouna, shows up from Michigan. Even though she presumably has a life there, she'll stay as long as it takes in New York City, to obtain the release of her son (apparently her job and her friends and relatives there are dispensable). Mouna is just as angelic as her son and his girlfriend. She enjoys drinking wine and listening to Phantom of the Opera (just before the film's climax, Dr. Vale is becoming more and more spontaneous and decides to take Mouna on a date to see an actual performance of 'Phantom').While The Visitor is ostensibly about the goodness and healing power of the Muslim World (and the Third World in general), the underlying SUB-TEXT of the narrative is still of a decided Christian bent. Like Jesus Christ, Tarek must offer himself up as a sacrifice so that Dr. Vale (the depressed Western middle-class intellectual) can redeem himself. Through Tarek's 'sacrifice' (his deportation back to his native Syria), Vale can now vent his rage at Tarek's Centurion-like tormentors (no longer passive, he screams at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service officers inside the Detention center, signaling a complete catharsis). The Passion play would not be complete without the further sacrifice of the saintly Mouna (a modern day Virgin Mary?) who has also offered herself up on the sacrificial altar (she too is headed back to Syria). Vale is finally cleansed (baptized?) and as the camera fades out, our once depressed loser has become a spontaneous, self-actualized man of Christian charity--playing his Western African drums in the subway and in effect announcing to the world that not only is he spontaneous but also vibrantly tolerant.There is nothing wrong in insisting that Americans treat outsiders with respect, compassion and tolerance if warranted. But let's not put such outsiders on a pedestal and at the same time, denigrate our own culture. If McCarthy was more honest, he would NOT have elevated his illegal immigrant characters to angelic status. By doing so, The Visitor sacrifices verisimilitude for propaganda and a skewed sense of reality.",2,Angelic characters undermine heart-felt immigrant saga,1236988800,"03 14, 2009",2009,4248,"['Warning', 'review', 'may', 'spoilers', 'think', 'back', 'time', 'college', 'how', 'many', 'professors', 'were', 'Walter', 'Vale', 'Visitor', 'main', 'character', 'How', 'many', 'were', 'so', 'depressed', 'felt', 'were', 'only', 'going', 'motions', 'life', 'Most', 'professors', 'knew', 'had', 'pretty', 'big', 'egos', 'enjoyed', 'imparting', 'information', 'students', 'promulgating', 'philosophy', 'life', 'believed', 'Why', 'particular', 'professor', 'so', 'cut', 'off', 'emotions', 'Was', 'death', 'wife', 'humdrum', 'routine', 'college', 'Writer/director', 'Thomas', 'McCarthy', 'created', 'character', 'so', 'extreme', 'detachment', ""n't"", 'seem', 'real', 'Vale', 'detachment', 'not', 'due', 'anger', 'rather', 'symbol', 'what', 'McCarthy', 'malaise', 'Western', 'Culture.Vale', 'symbol', 'one', 'ingredient', 'can', 'make', 'self-actualized', 'person', 'spontaneity', 'Certainly', 'superiors', 'up', 'college', 'colleagues', 'NYU', 'development', 'conference', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'spontaneity', 'will', 'turn', 'more', 'alive', 'better', 'people', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'redeem', 'robotic', 'Vale', 'are', 'spontaneous', ""'life-affirming"", 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'who', 'come', 'Vale', 'life', 'act', 'catalyst', 'self-redemption.The', 'ego-less', 'sad-sack', 'Vale', 'call', 'police', 'immediately', 'when', 'Tarek', 'Zainab', 'Syrian-Palestianian', 'Sengalese', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'illegally', 'squatting', 'apartment', 'goodness', 'heart', 'Tarek', 'Zainab', 'loving', 'support', 'will', 'teach', 'Dr.', 'Vale', 'how', 'become', ""'cool"", 'guy', 'instructing', 'Vale', 'art', 'West', 'African', 'drumming.McCarthy', 'would', 'be', 'remiss', 'did', 'not', 'throw', 'few', 'antagonists', 'mix', 'First', 'bunch', 'mean', 'undercover', 'cops', 'Central', 'Park', 'West/W', '72nd', 'Street', 'subway', 'station', 'who', 'arrest', 'Tarek', 'fare', 'beating', 'even', 'could', 'have', 'clearly', 'seen', 'went', 'turnstile', 'AFTER', 'paying', 'fare', 'Metrocard', 'Worse', 'villains', 'emerge', 'faceless', 'Immigration', 'Custom', 'Enforcement', 'Agents', 'who', 'imprison', 'Tarek', 'Federal', 'detention', 'facility', 'threaten', 'deport', 'him.Soon', 'afterward', 'Tarek', 'mother', 'Mouna', 'up', 'Michigan', 'Even', 'presumably', 'life', 'there', ""'ll"", 'stay', 'as', 'long', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'obtain', 'release', 'son', 'apparently', 'job', 'friends', 'relatives', 'are', 'dispensable', 'Mouna', 'just', 'as', 'angelic', 'son', 'girlfriend', 'drinking', 'wine', 'listening', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'just', 'film', 'climax', 'Dr.', 'Vale', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'spontaneous', 'take', 'Mouna', 'date', 'see', 'actual', 'performance', ""'Phantom"", 'Visitor', 'ostensibly', 'goodness', 'healing', 'power', 'Muslim', 'World', 'Third', 'World', 'general', 'underlying', 'SUB-TEXT', 'narrative', 'still', 'decided', 'Christian', 'bent', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Tarek', 'must', 'offer', 'up', 'sacrifice', 'so', 'Dr.', 'Vale', 'depressed', 'Western', 'middle-class', 'intellectual', 'can', 'redeem', 'Tarek', ""'sacrifice"", 'deportation', 'back', 'native', 'Syria', 'Vale', 'can', 'now', 'vent', 'rage', 'Tarek', 'Centurion-like', 'tormentors', 'no', 'longer', 'passive', 'Immigration', 'Customs', 'Enforcement', 'Service', 'officers', 'Detention', 'center', 'signaling', 'complete', 'catharsis', 'Passion', 'play', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'complete', 'further', 'sacrifice', 'saintly', 'Mouna', 'modern', 'day', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'who', 'also', 'offered', 'up', 'sacrificial', 'altar', 'too', 'headed', 'back', 'Syria', 'Vale', 'finally', 'cleansed', 'baptized', 'camera', 'out', 'once', 'depressed', 'loser', 'become', 'spontaneous', 'self-actualized', 'man', 'Christian', 'charity', 'playing', 'Western', 'African', 'drums', 'subway', 'effect', 'announcing', 'world', 'not', 'only', 'spontaneous', 'also', 'vibrantly', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'insisting', 'Americans', 'treat', 'outsiders', 'respect', 'compassion', 'tolerance', 'warranted', 'let', 'not', 'put', 'such', 'outsiders', 'pedestal', 'same', 'time', 'denigrate', 'own', 'culture', 'McCarthy', 'was', 'more', 'honest', 'would', 'NOT', 'have', 'elevated', 'illegal', 'immigrant', 'characters', 'angelic', 'status', 'doing', 'so', 'Visitor', 'sacrifices', 'verisimilitude', 'propaganda', 'skewed', 'sense', 'reality']",N/A

And, oh, was it worth the time and price of admission!!!Richard Jenkins gives an Oscar-worthy performance as a college professor with a mundane existence whose life turns upon meeting a pair of immigrants staying in the New York apartment he uses when he has busines in the city (he lives in an upscale suburban neighborhood otherwise). Once the initial shock wears, the three begin to warm to each other and the prof begins to get in touch with a passion for life which had been extinguished since his marriage ended a while back.This is clearly a fine independent movie which speaks to how immigrants are looked upon as well as what can happen when one begins to remember how wonderful life can really be and begins to come alive once again.  This movie is full of surprising twists and turns which make for an interesting movie experience.See THIS ONE...BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY!!!!!!  If on DVD...Great.  If on Blu-ray...EVEN GREATER!!!!!

The professor in the end could have truly changed his life, but in the end we just see a self-centered man.I am not sure if the movie's portrayal of the treatment of immigrants is true or not? If true. Then it's sad that we treat people this way and I hope the movie helps to change the situation. If this is a false recreation then the movie is just a political manipulation, and the movie is just that.The part which I found interesting was the reflection on us Americans' that in the end we do not care what happens to people in other countries. Tarek's father died, because he wrote against the political establishment of Syria, he died after his brutal treatment in a Syrian prison. You would think that his mother and son could receive political asylum in our country for him speaking out against a tyrannical government? This was glanced over in the movie, and you would think that a professor of third world economics would start to carefully analyze what occurred and help Tarek and his mother, Mouna gain political asylum.He let Mouna go to Syria without any knowledge what would happen to her once she got there. He just went to the subway and played his drum. This was his liberation? His rebellion? This is a bunch of crap. I am startled how this movie portrayed Americans. I do not think we are represented by this person as a people. Perhaps this movie is trying to prevent us from becoming like the professor.

Also, the couple is in the US illegally.It is all very predictable, with one person being sent back home and the prof trying to make the detention center officers feel guilty--to no avail-and then he takes up drumming in the subway as a tribute to his missing pal.Also, there are several shots of the Statue of Liberty, the flag, and so on, which are clearly meant to get in our faces about injustice in the face of a free country.

Had too many dead spots and the film could have been shortened by 15 to 20 minutes. I don't think we needed the parts about playing the drums in your underwear, especially seeing the professor do it also.  The professor was a pretty patheic person and I would like to think it was because of the death of his wife.  I remember Tarek in the detention center saying he had done nothing wrong. I saw several things he had done wrong, 1)Illegally in this country. 2)Living in someone else's apartment, 3)Fled Michigan after his deportation hearing and 4)Not paying taxes on the income he earned.  The film tries to paint the United States as evil because we can't accept ALL the worlds downtrodden people.  The people who came to this country legally and followed the proper procedures ought to be appaulded and NOT the law breakers. The rest of the world would love for all their undesirables to leave their country.  In Syria if you were in the country illegally death or immediate deportation is what would have happened to Traek not months of legal red tape in our country.  Tarek did not like the detention center in Queens I bet it was a palace compared to any detention center in Syria. They made the guards look bad.  I don't think anyone was beaten or starved!

Freeman ""Zach""","[0, 0]","After achieving critical (if not box office) success with his 2003 directorial debut The Station Agent (which he also wrote), writer/director Thomas McCarthy is back with another understated human drama that critics are already in love with, and for good reason. The Visitor, McCarthy's second film, works on many of the same levels as his first, making very real characters in very real situations come alive and be interesting.Richard Jenkins, most recently seen in the slapstick comedy Step Brothers as John C. Reilly's uptight father, gives a quietly moving performance (a la Bill Murray in Lost In Translation, though with a bit more emotion) that gives the film a solid backbone for its emotional story. Jenkins is Walter Vale, an introverted professor who has become something of a recluse since the death of his wife. When he is asked to make a trip to New York to present a research paper at a conference, he discovers that an immigrant couple have taken up residence in his apartment there. The rest of the film centers around their unlikely friendship and the challenges they face.It's a moving story with powerful acting from everyone involved and a script that moves the action along nicely without forcing anything. There are a few moments when the film starts to feel just a little preachy about immigration laws but this can be seen more as the frustration of the characters rather than a simple attempt at forcing a message.The last 30 minutes are fairly emotional, but in a quiet, heartfelt way. The Visitor really is a moving film for anyone who enjoys a good film that inspires conversation.",4,A moving film that inspires conversation,1224806400,"10 24, 2008",2008,1611,"['achieving', 'critical', 'not', 'box', 'office', 'success', '2003', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Station', 'Agent', 'also', 'wrote', 'writer/director', 'Thomas', 'McCarthy', 'back', 'understated', 'human', 'drama', 'critics', 'are', 'already', 'love', 'good', 'reason', 'Visitor', 'McCarthy', 'second', 'film', 'many', 'same', 'levels', 'first', 'making', 'very', 'real', 'characters', 'very', 'real', 'situations', 'come', 'alive', 'be', 'interesting.Richard', 'Jenkins', 'most', 'recently', 'seen', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'Step', 'Brothers', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'uptight', 'father', 'quietly', 'moving', 'performance', 'la', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'bit', 'more', 'emotion', 'film', 'solid', 'backbone', 'emotional', 'story', 'Jenkins', 'Walter', 'Vale', 'introverted', 'professor', 'who', 'become', 'something', 'recluse', 'death', 'wife', 'When', 'asked', 'make', 'trip', 'New', 'York', 'present', 'research', 'paper', 'conference', 'immigrant', 'couple', 'have', 'taken', 'up', 'residence', 'apartment', 'there', 'rest', 'film', 'centers', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'challenges', 'face.It', 'moving', 'story', 'powerful', 'acting', 'everyone', 'involved', 'script', 'action', 'nicely', 'forcing', 'anything', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'when', 'film', 'feel', 'just', 'little', 'preachy', 'immigration', 'laws', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'more', 'frustration', 'characters', 'rather', 'simple', 'attempt', 'forcing', 'message.The', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'are', 'fairly', 'emotional', 'quiet', 'heartfelt', 'way', 'Visitor', 'really', 'moving', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'film', 'conversation']",N/A
