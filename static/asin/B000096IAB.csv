752659,A31NE5DL1EVTFC,B000096IAB,"David OBrien ""Powerpop lover""","[14, 16]","Directed by Alan Clarke and scripted by David Leland, this is an excellent one off play/film about a deliquent 16 year old called Trevor played by Tim Roth who refuses to conform to the laws. He gets in trouble with authority but doesn't heed the warnings until he is finally 'dealt with' by the powers that be. At the end of the film, we see a frightened but not cowed teenager who must face punishment for his crimes. I remember seeing this film when it aired on Channel 4 in the UK in the 1980s. At the time, it had a big impact on me as I was a teenager myself. Down through the years it is still being hailed as a very important piece of work regarding its social commentary and is mentioned in the same breath as Alan Clarke's other play 'Scum'. It also bears striking similarities to Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange' and Shane Meadows' new film 'This Is England'.The best part of this film is the performance of Tim Roth who showed his talent at a young age in this his first major film. Roth has gone on to excel as a movie star since then. It really is worth watching this. Roth appears in nearly every frame of this 73 minute film and it makes for compelling viewing.",5,Tim Roth tour de force,1177891200,"04 30, 2007",2007,1175,"['Directed', 'Alan', 'Clarke', 'scripted', 'David', 'Leland', 'excellent', 'one', 'play/film', 'deliquent', '16', 'year', 'old', 'called', 'Trevor', 'played', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'who', 'conform', 'laws', 'trouble', 'authority', ""n't"", 'heed', 'warnings', 'finally', ""'dealt"", 'powers', 'be', 'end', 'film', 'see', 'frightened', 'not', 'cowed', 'teenager', 'who', 'must', 'face', 'punishment', 'crimes', 'remember', 'seeing', 'film', 'when', 'aired', 'Channel', '4', 'UK', '1980s', 'time', 'had', 'big', 'impact', 'was', 'teenager', 'Down', 'years', 'still', 'being', 'hailed', 'very', 'important', 'piece', 'work', 'regarding', 'social', 'commentary', 'mentioned', 'same', 'breath', 'Alan', 'Clarke', 'other', 'play', 'also', 'striking', 'similarities', 'Kubrick', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'Shane', 'Meadows', 'new', 'film', ""'This"", ""England'.The"", 'best', 'part', 'film', 'performance', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'who', 'showed', 'talent', 'young', 'age', 'first', 'major', 'film', 'Roth', 'gone', 'excel', 'movie', 'star', 'then', 'really', 'worth', 'watching', 'Roth', 'nearly', 'frame', '73', 'minute', 'film', 'compelling', 'viewing']",N/A

Tim Roth completely gets the character, so his fans will love this film; he is a first rate actor and this is one of his first acting gigs.  But the deeper point is the insight that he offers into what can only be called a radical politics that is anarchic, sociopathic, and right wing.If you have ever looked into the eyes of someone who hates you because of your race and is prepared to hurt or kill you for it, you will recognize the core message of this film. If that is something you want to understand, then this is your film in spades.  As a half-Chinese, I have seen this in its rawest form as a youth in the US.  It is real, ugly, and unredeemable, unreachable.  I have never seen it portrayed in such a raw manner, at least in regards to skinheads.REcommended.
