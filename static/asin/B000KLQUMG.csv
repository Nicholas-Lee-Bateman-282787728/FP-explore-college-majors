1034952,A19K5DILM15WU3,B000KLQUMG,Alex,"[29, 30]","I used to watch this show when I was younger and I remember being really into it, which is why I bought the first season. It was way better than I remembered. Each episode is so hilareous due to clevar writing and a witty cast. Libby, the mean popular girl, is by far one of the funniest characters and the things Sabrina does to get back at her are hugely entertaining. The Aunts are some of the best supporting characters in sitcom history. My family and I watched the whole sitting in three days. We became semi-addicted to it, plus it flys by so fast. Each episode is paced so well that it's not to fast, but it never gets boring. It's a perfect blend of everything you could want in a family friendly sitcom. This is not just for kids or teens, it's for everyone. I can't wait until Season 2 gets released in July and I hope Paramount eventually releases the entire series.The worst thing about this release is that there are no bonus features. Not even a commentary or a cast retrospective. I still give it 5 stars because the complete series was what I bought it for, but it would have been nice to have Melissa Joan Hart come back and talk a little bit about the show. I mean, it was such a big part of her life. As other people have pointed out, some of the music isn't original due to copyright issues. I can't remember any of the original music from when I used to watch the show, but I didn't think any of the songs sounded out of place, so for the average viewer like me, it shouldn't distract from your enjoyment of the DVDs.One of the best things about this season set besides the show itself is the case. I have run out of room for big season box sets. Even though this is a 4-disc set, it comes in a standard DVD case. The case is like your standard 2-disc case, but there is a DVD on each side of the physical case and a hinged plastic flap holds the other two discs very nicely. I shook it around and none of the discs flew off their hinges. Very nice packaging.I highly reccomend this season to everyone. No matter who you are (guy, girl, old, young) you are sure to find something entertaining in ""Sabrina The Teenage Witch.""",5,Way Better Than I Remembered!!!!!,1175126400,"03 29, 2007",2007,2146,"['used', 'watch', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'remember', 'being', 'really', 'why', 'bought', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'way', 'better', 'remembered', 'episode', 'so', 'hilareous', 'due', 'clevar', 'writing', 'witty', 'cast', 'Libby', 'mean', 'popular', 'girl', 'far', 'one', 'funniest', 'characters', 'things', 'Sabrina', 'get', 'back', 'are', 'hugely', 'entertaining', 'Aunts', 'are', 'best', 'supporting', 'characters', 'sitcom', 'history', 'family', 'watched', 'whole', 'sitting', 'three', 'days', 'became', 'semi-addicted', 'flys', 'fast', 'episode', 'paced', 'so', 'well', 'not', 'fast', 'never', 'boring', 'perfect', 'blend', 'everything', 'could', 'want', 'family', 'friendly', 'sitcom', 'not', 'just', 'kids', 'teens', 'everyone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Season', '2', 'released', 'July', 'hope', 'Paramount', 'eventually', 'entire', 'series.The', 'worst', 'thing', 'release', 'are', 'bonus', 'features', 'Not', 'even', 'commentary', 'cast', 'retrospective', 'still', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'complete', 'series', 'was', 'what', 'bought', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'Melissa', 'Joan', 'Hart', 'come', 'back', 'talk', 'little', 'bit', 'show', 'mean', 'was', 'such', 'big', 'part', 'life', 'other', 'people', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'music', ""n't"", 'original', 'due', 'copyright', 'issues', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'original', 'music', 'when', 'used', 'watch', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'songs', 'sounded', 'place', 'so', 'average', 'viewer', 'should', ""n't"", 'distract', 'enjoyment', 'DVDs.One', 'best', 'things', 'season', 'set', 'show', 'case', 'have', 'run', 'room', 'big', 'season', 'box', 'sets', 'Even', '4-disc', 'set', 'standard', 'DVD', 'case', 'case', 'standard', '2-disc', 'case', 'DVD', 'side', 'physical', 'case', 'hinged', 'plastic', 'flap', 'other', 'two', 'discs', 'very', 'nicely', 'shook', 'none', 'discs', 'flew', 'hinges', 'Very', 'nice', 'packaging.I', 'highly', 'reccomend', 'season', 'everyone', 'No', 'matter', 'who', 'are', 'guy', 'girl', 'old', 'young', 'are', 'sure', 'find', 'something', 'entertaining', 'Sabrina', 'Teenage', 'Witch']","Sabrina, The Teenage Witch: Season 1"

1034964,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B000KLQUMG,Byron Kolln,"[6, 6]","I loved this show so much!  Developed from a high-rating Showtime Network telemovie, SABRINA: THE TEENAGE WITCH was one of the most popular sitcoms of the late-90's, starring Melissa Joan Hart in the title role.  Based around the Archie Comics spin-off, Sabrina Spellman lives with her two wacky aunts Hilda and Zelda in the tight-knit town of Westbridge.  Sixteen years old and about to start a new school, Sabrina's life is complicated enough, until Hilda and Zelda reveal that her father is a warlock and, as such, Sabrina too has magical powers.  Life as a half-mortal doesn't come easily (for most of the first episode, all Sabrina can conjure is pineapples!), but gradually she learns the ""tricks"" of her trade.Melissa Joan Hart is a perky and appealing heroine; her performance as Sabrina glues the whole premise together and gives believability to even the most outlandish plot.  Co-starring as Sabrina's well-meaning aunts, Caroline Rhea (Hilda) and Beth Broderick (Zelda) are total scene-stealers with their comic ""odd couple"" dynamic.  Nate Richert plays Sabrina's faithful boyfriend Harvey, and Michelle Beaudoin is her best friend Jenny.  Jenna Leigh Green is snooty arch-rival Libby.  Nick Bakay provides the voice of Salem, the Spellman family cat, who is actually a warlock forced to spend 100 years as a feline after his attempt at global conquest!The first season of SABRINA: THE TEENAGE WITCH was marked by top performances from a well-picked ensemble cast, witty scripts and imaginative scenarios.  Gradually, as with any top-rating show, the quality seemed to degrade over subsequent seasons (and died a slow death as Sabrina moved on to college 6 years later--without most of the main cast and completely devoid of charm).  Happily, now fans can relish this show when it was at it's freshest and most appealing, with this set of the complete first season.COMPLETE EPISODE LISTING:""Pilot"" - Meet Sabrina Spellman.

1034996,A1QI71TUWQMGD6,B000KLQUMG,Kevin Wollenweber,"[11, 11]","Oh, man, I'd been hoping and hoping for this first season set to find its way to DVD for a while now, and it is finally here!I know that my age group or gender probably was not the intended audience for this series, but it captured me after a few episodes in its original run on TV.  it works on the level it is supposed to work, but there are so many sly representations of golden age TV in this series that I just could not pull myself away--there is even an appearance by my generation's favorite kids' show host, Chuck McCann in a cameo on what is one of my favorite episodes of the first season, in which Sabrina's best friend, Jenny Kelly, stays with Sabrina for a weekend and curiously finds her way into that closet that sends her, a mortal, into the Other Realm where she meets up with the wonderfully smug and nasty Head of the Witches' Council, played with just the right amount of grease by Penn Gillette, and his secretary who, I believe, is actually played by Debra Harrie of Blondie!!And this brings up how much I adored the character of Jenny Kelly, a nonconformist free spirit who stands out as a great supporting player in this first season and, if such things are truly important, a good role model to the intended audience!  If only Sabrina, herself, listened carefully to Jenny's philosophy, she'd have gotten through her realization that she is ""different"" so much easier.  Jenny is played so enjoyably by Michelle Beaudoin and helps make this first season well worth the money.My only real complaint about the package, here, as it appears on DVD for the first time, is that all original pop songs have been removed from the key episodes, even though, thankfully enough, the appearance of the Violent Fems remains intact on yet another wonderful episode in which Aunts Hilda and Zelda become teen-agers again to escort Sabrina on a trip with an unlikely bunch of schoolmates to meet and greet their favorite band at a local record shop.  The impressions of the aunts as angst-ridden teens, having to go through the trials and tribulations, first hand all over again is utterly hilarious!  Don't overlook this series' first season as just kids' media.  Those writing the scripts were truly writing from memories of their own younger days, as evidenced in the afore-mentioned episode, and not only is Michelle Beaudoin as jenny (who only appeared in this season) a breath of fresh air here, but it is also fun to watch jenna Leigh Green as smarmy Libby Chessler; in fact, there are times when she is almost a bit lovable.  There is an episode in which Miss Green has to play Sabrina disguised as Libby as well as Libby herself and she comes close to stealing the spotlight away from Melissa Joan Hart who plays the title character.But, again, why remove those pop songs?  usually, I'm screaming about how great musicians often see their good songs misused in bad TV sitcoms, but the songs used for this season were not intended to delegitimize the tune.  In an episode about a day when Sabrina's mood grew darker, it was fun to hear REM's ""Shiny, Happy People"" since I always thought that Michael Stipe was writing with his tongue somewhat in his cheek, or Liz Phair's song used on the Violent Fems episode as Sabrina takes off into the air on her first vehicle, a flying vacuum cleaner.  Since Ms. Phair writes with a spikey sense of humor, I would have thought that she would not have minded the inclusion of her song here!  The music substituted was okay, but I'm a stickler for keeping things the way they were when we first were introduced to the show in question, and the inclusion of the afore-mentioned tunes and others were what gave this season of this series a hint of real coolness above other shows aimed at the same core audience on those Friday nights.But all the great scenes are here and I urge those of you, like me, who called this show their guilty pleasure to check this out.next time, though, leave the music be, and please give us some great special features!  Didn't anybody connected with this series have the occasional fond memory to share?  Give yourselves a big hand, here.

She's just moved in with her aunts Hilda (Caroline Rhea) and Zelda (Beth Broderick) and is starting a new school.But that's not all.  On her sixteenth birthday, Sabrina learns that she is a witch who is just starting to get her powers.  So not only does she need to fit in at school, but she needs to hide her powers for fear of being labeled a freak.  And there's the fact that their cat Salem talks (voiced by Nick Bakay).On her first day of school, she quickly makes friends with idealistic Jenny (Michelle Beaudoin) and develops a crush on Harvey (Nate Richert).  Unfortunately, she also draws the distain of head cheerleader Libby (Jenna Leigh Green).  And she has to survive biology with Mr. Poole (Paul Feig).This school year will be anything but easy as she turns Libby into a pineapple, learns that messing with her friends lives can cause terrible things to happen, makes a magician invisible, gets trapped in a mirror of her own bad mood, turns Harvey into a frog when they kiss, and faces her own worst fear when Libby accuses her of being a witch while on a field trip to Salem, Massachusetts.  Who ever said being a witch was easy?I actually started watching this show with season two, but have caught season one multiple times in reruns.  Maybe it's because I started later, but I've never found this to be one of my favorite seasons.  Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of laughs.  But it just seems a bit like the show is still finding its feet.  Of course, that is pretty normal for many shows in their first year.This show definitely falls into the fantasy category, and it creates its magical world well.  I do laugh quite a bit at the situations Sabrina gets into over the course of the season.  The acting is good.  Most of the special effects work, although a few are a little obvious, especially the puppet version of Salem in the early episodes.This set contains all 24 episodes from the season on four discs.  There are no bonus features, although the full frame picture and stereo sound look and sound great.There isn't anything serious about this show, but it isn't trying to be serious.

I used to watch it all the time, so much that I saw some episodes too many times. (Especially the one where the little boy steals Salem, the amount of times I saw that episode was unbelievable.)I got this TV show for an absolute bargain, so was really pleased, and started watching it straight away. Each episode is a little over 20 minutes, so it's easy to watch way too many in one sitting.I don't really remember too many of these episodes, as I say, it's been a few years since I saw them originally, I remember the later ones more, but as soon as the theme tune started, I was back to being a teenager again.I always wanted to be Sabrina. I always wanted to have a sarcastic talking cat - I had a talking cockateil, who could whistle the Laurel & Hardy tune, but never get the end bit right. It's not the same is it? My hatred for Libby came straight back, the want to braid Jennie's hair came flying back, and the want to get a cuter guy in than Harvey - it all came flooding straight back to me as soon as I saw the first episode. I've seen the made for TV movie more, which I hated, because it didn't have the same characters in it.I didn't really have a favourite episode. I loved all of them, and was quite surprised to see the first season ended 'normally' - every TV show I watch these days always ends with a cliffhanger. I can't wait to watch another show, but they're not a very reasonable price at the moment, plus I got the first season of Buffy for my birthday.Sabrina was my childhood idol, and I very much enjoyed revisiting the very first season all over again. It's a must have for anyone who remembers it, or who also watched Clarissa Explains It All (something which I also loved, but haven't been able to buy on DVD yet), or just simply loves anything similar to this (Charmed, Buffy, Hocus Pocus).

I'm sure most parents would allow kids 10 and over to watch and perhaps some as young as 8.The show is about a sixteen year old girl, Sabrina, who finds out that she is a witch.  She lives with her two aunts and a talking cat.  She must learn about her powers while at the same time struggling through typical teen issues at school.  Her two aunts are witches that help her in both areas.  As a teen, Sabrina doesn't always make the best decisions but that provides the learning opportunities in the show much like they do in real life.  There's a moral lesson in each episode, which is a good thing.While I didn't find the show all that funny, it was entertaining.
