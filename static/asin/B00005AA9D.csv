It was such a super good movie and I would Highly Recommend it! I found it so exciting to watch and the quality of the movie and acting could not have been better!,5,Civil War Journal: The Conflict Begins,1364688000,"03 31, 2013",2013,334,"['was', 'told', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'movie', 'anymore', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'had', 'purchased', 'last', 'part', 'movie', 'do', 'was', 'so', 'pleased', 'when', 'found', 'Amazon', 'was', 'such', 'super', 'good', 'movie', 'would', 'Highly', 'Recommend', 'found', 'so', 'exciting', 'watch', 'quality', 'movie', 'acting', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'better']",N/A

John Brown's raid, often ignored in studies of the Civil War, did indeed help set the stage for the inevitable split between the states. Madman to the south, martyr to the north, he helped ignite simmering differences into a firestorm. THe history of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry is also covered much better than the longer but Hollywoodized ""Glory.""

576283,A1MGGDWRGEVOJ2,B00005AA9D,"Rhett D. Sorensen ""Old Keen Eye""","[3, 3]","The first disc includes John Brown and his assault on Harpers Ferry. It was pretty good, but did lack some detail such as his financial backers, ""The Secret Six"". Still, it was pretty good and pretty engaging. The second episode on the first disc was on Fort Sumter and the Conferderacies first strike. Again, it was a solid representation and had good info, but not ground breaking by any means.The second disc had covered The battle of Manasses, AKA Bull Run. A solid episode, fin and had enough of the basic info and covered some lesser known aspects as well. The last episode was on the 54th Massachusetts and the black regiment that led the assault on Fort Wagner. It was more historically acurate than ""Glory"" but not nearly as fun. Still, I enjoyed it, but it made me want to watch ""Glory"" when it was over.All in all it was a solid production. Nothing earth shattering, and may be boring if you are really serious about the civil war. For the casual historian and civil war person, like myself, it was worth watching and was a good refresher course. It had enough info that I don't yet feel the need to reread ""Battle Cry of Freedom"" or Leckies Civil War book. If you are a Civil War beginner then this is perfect and will give you a solid basis for furhter studies.",4,Solid DVD on the civil wars begining,1191888000,"10 9, 2007",2007,1274,"['first', 'disc', 'John', 'Brown', 'assault', 'Harpers', 'Ferry', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'did', 'lack', 'detail', 'such', 'financial', 'backers', 'Secret', 'Six', 'Still', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'pretty', 'engaging', 'second', 'episode', 'first', 'disc', 'was', 'Fort', 'Sumter', 'Conferderacies', 'first', 'strike', 'Again', 'was', 'solid', 'representation', 'had', 'good', 'info', 'not', 'ground', 'breaking', 'means.The', 'second', 'disc', 'had', 'covered', 'battle', 'Manasses', 'AKA', 'Bull', 'Run', 'A', 'solid', 'episode', 'fin', 'had', 'enough', 'basic', 'info', 'covered', 'lesser', 'known', 'aspects', 'as', 'well', 'last', 'episode', 'was', '54th', 'Massachusetts', 'black', 'regiment', 'led', 'assault', 'Fort', 'Wagner', 'was', 'more', 'historically', 'acurate', 'Glory', 'not', 'nearly', 'fun', 'Still', 'enjoyed', 'made', 'want', 'watch', 'Glory', 'when', 'was', 'over.All', 'was', 'solid', 'production', 'Nothing', 'earth', 'shattering', 'may', 'be', 'boring', 'are', 'really', 'serious', 'civil', 'war', 'casual', 'historian', 'civil', 'war', 'person', 'was', 'worth', 'watching', 'was', 'good', 'refresher', 'course', 'had', 'enough', 'info', 'do', ""n't"", 'yet', 'feel', 'need', 'reread', 'Battle', 'Cry', 'Freedom', 'Leckies', 'Civil', 'War', 'book', 'are', 'Civil', 'War', 'beginner', 'then', 'perfect', 'will', 'give', 'solid', 'basis', 'furhter', 'studies']",N/A
576284,A3VQSFORKH8B7O,B00005AA9D,Steven Hancock,"[8, 8]","The Civil War was the conflict that transformed our divided country into a nation. The beginnings of America's bloodiest war are explored with ""Civil War Journal: The Conflict Begins,"" which collects four epiodes of the acclaimed documentary series.The first episode in the set deals with John Brown and his raid on Harper's Ferry, which is believed by many historians to be one of the key incidents that lead directly to the war. Although well put together like the other episodes, this one seems to excuse the brutality of Brown, and cast him in a light of martyrdom, when he was really a madman.The other three documentaries though are a real treasure. The battles of Fort Sumter and 1st Manassas are given overviews that are moving and accurate. While not entirely connected with the beginnings of the war, the documentary on the 54th Massachusettes Volunteer Infantry, the first all-black regiment in the Union army, is equally impressive.Despite the weak first documentary, this DVD set is a good primer for those who are studying the Civil War, as well as a good refresher course for others.Grade: B+",4,A TERRIFIC LOOK AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CIVIL WAR!,1135123200,"12 21, 2005",2005,1107,"['Civil', 'War', 'was', 'conflict', 'transformed', 'divided', 'country', 'nation', 'beginnings', 'America', 'bloodiest', 'war', 'are', 'explored', 'Civil', 'War', 'Journal', 'Conflict', 'Begins', 'four', 'epiodes', 'acclaimed', 'documentary', 'series.The', 'first', 'episode', 'set', 'deals', 'John', 'Brown', 'raid', 'Harper', 'Ferry', 'believed', 'many', 'historians', 'be', 'one', 'key', 'incidents', 'lead', 'directly', 'war', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'other', 'episodes', 'one', 'excuse', 'brutality', 'Brown', 'cast', 'light', 'martyrdom', 'when', 'was', 'really', 'madman.The', 'other', 'three', 'documentaries', 'are', 'real', 'treasure', 'battles', 'Fort', 'Sumter', '1st', 'Manassas', 'are', 'given', 'overviews', 'are', 'moving', 'accurate', 'not', 'entirely', 'connected', 'beginnings', 'war', 'documentary', '54th', 'Massachusettes', 'Volunteer', 'Infantry', 'first', 'all-black', 'regiment', 'Union', 'army', 'equally', 'impressive.Despite', 'weak', 'first', 'documentary', 'DVD', 'set', 'good', 'primer', 'who', 'are', 'studying', 'Civil', 'War', 'as', 'well', 'good', 'refresher', 'course', 'others.Grade', 'B+']",N/A
