""Stand Up Guys"" was created with a good deal of material that drips with ill applied attempts at misty-eyed moments. Walken and Pacino play aged and ""washed up"" criminals well, but their internal struggles with family and age are more of a 'who cares' when it boils down to knowing that these mutts had a very immoral and illegal history.The entertainment value is not in the characters losses or inner turmoils, but in who they ARE now. The comedy of errors is the key to liking this film.  The first half hour is drab with Pachino doing some weird stuff like snorting prescription meds and trying to turn on today's young girls with old school moves. It was bombing so bad I almost turned off the DVD player.Eventually, a nice stride kicked in and the film became a strange fixation as the two stars street antics became funny and interesting. The arrival of Alan Arkin made for a chemistry fueled trio that increased the chuckle level, sustaining the film. I was also surprised by the solid action sequences and capable posturing by the main stars. It's all more than a bit stagey and full of itself , and from this you get a mediocre film that is unlikely to reach the broadest of audiences.",3,Stand up guys??,1384387200,"11 14, 2013",2013,1293,"[""'ve"", 'gotten', 'point', 'life', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'sentimentality', 'going', 'bad', 'guys', 'Stand', 'Up', 'Guys', 'was', 'created', 'good', 'deal', 'material', 'ill', 'applied', 'attempts', 'misty-eyed', 'moments', 'Walken', 'Pacino', 'play', 'aged', 'washed', 'up', 'criminals', 'well', 'internal', 'struggles', 'family', 'age', 'are', 'more', ""'who"", 'cares', 'when', 'down', 'knowing', 'mutts', 'had', 'very', 'immoral', 'illegal', 'history.The', 'entertainment', 'value', 'not', 'characters', 'losses', 'inner', 'turmoils', 'who', 'ARE', 'now', 'comedy', 'errors', 'key', 'liking', 'film', 'first', 'hour', 'drab', 'Pachino', 'doing', 'weird', 'stuff', 'snorting', 'prescription', 'meds', 'trying', 'turn', 'today', 'young', 'girls', 'old', 'school', 'moves', 'was', 'bombing', 'so', 'bad', 'almost', 'turned', 'off', 'DVD', 'player.Eventually', 'nice', 'stride', 'kicked', 'film', 'became', 'strange', 'fixation', 'two', 'stars', 'street', 'antics', 'became', 'funny', 'interesting', 'arrival', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'made', 'chemistry', 'fueled', 'trio', 'increased', 'chuckle', 'level', 'sustaining', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'surprised', 'solid', 'action', 'sequences', 'capable', 'posturing', 'main', 'stars', 'more', 'bit', 'stagey', 'full', 'get', 'mediocre', 'film', 'unlikely', 'reach', 'broadest', 'audiences']",Stand Up Guys

Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 38% by the pro reviewers and 48% by the ordinary viewers. So that's the numbers for you.

If you want Plato's Republic on the meaning of life, go elsewhere, but these three actors show three different lives, portrayed within a time of 24 hours -- they present how each life was lived, and how they see themselves as having sometimes done right and sometimes having done what they now regret. The same words in another actor would sound like tin, but here you feel the weight and pain of each line. I cannot imagine the director nor the screen writer creating these characterizations, they had to come from the unique imagination of each of these fully-accomplished actors, no where else. It is this creation out of the ensemble which is breath-taking and unique; you can see how they reached beyond the dross that the director and screen writer gave them. Three other actors, even if accomplished, would have come up with a different movie.Another review points out that these three are crooks, why should we care about lowlifes? Although the guys are criminals, and we never learn the depths of their criminality, Pacino's 'guy' lays out utterly clear, why life is a precious gift to each of us.

Fist in my humble opinion, Once you see the first three actors I think you just order it as a must see. The plot is good.  Story line is great.  Acting is just fantastic.  TheY really cleaned up Walken for this role. Al Pacino's character looks a little beat up. And Arkin looks about the same. I wont give anything away. The story is basically this.  Al Pacino and his two friends were not the most law abiding men. Some events took place, Al Pacino's character took the fall for everyone and went to jail.  They are old school hence the title ""Stand Up Guys"".  These guys don't rat on anyone. Well During one of the events 25 years earlier at least i think, along with the illegal things they were doing, which they don't go into that much, but enough for you to get the point, something goes very wrong, and Al Pacino's character is blamed by a mob boss. Now, Walkens character is the only one who kept in touch, and sent care packages. Walkens also has issues, as in no contact with his daughter or granddaughter.  These things he is working on. Pacino while out tells walken to get a move on and get his family straight. But Walken is not thinking about that as much at the moment. Al Pacino just got out of jail and he is still a bit of a party animal and wants to have fun. So Walken is keeping an eye on his best friend, Pacino's Character. The mistake I mentioned earlier was that some big mob boss seemed fit to blame on Pacino's character, and this is really the main theme of the movie more so and the few that are left from the earlier crew, they are gone except the few you see. They add up to three?  Well these three that are left, their  involvement now that Pacino is out is also a big deal in keeping with the theme.I cant go into anymore than that without giving anything away. What i can tell you is this.  It is first class acting for any generation, a story for any generation, and it does keep you on the edge of your seat or i should say suspenseful until the very end. There is no way you can go wrong. They also add dry humor, sarcastic humor in there at the exact moments you would want it. It was written perfectly in my eyes.  Even if you are not great fans of any of these people, and i cant see how you cant be, but even if your not, it is just a breath of fresh air in terms of movies that have been coming out over the last five years. Maybe decade.  These actors and actresses just work perfectly together and have great chemistry. I give it 5 stars and i say watch it.  You wont be disappointed in this movie. It brings out so many emotions as well up to the very end. I loved it. And i think you guys and gals will to.

A third ""old"" friend is thrown into the mix and magically has all his medical problems live him to drive a chase scene, wear out a hooker, and then die behind the wheel of a stolen car while waiting for his other old friends.Overall the acting was good, but the story was very weak. You would think with an actor like Pacino, whose voice is so commanding that it makes you want to buy a Jeep even though they are junk cars, the movie could have been built behind the power of his voice. But it wasn't.As a rental, it was OK. I am glad I didn't spend $40 to go to the theater to see this and somewhat happy I didn't fork over $20 to buy the DVD.The ending was so Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid, absent the leap, that it left you wondering if they had any real good writers typing out the script.This just reinforces that actors are trained parrots.

It is an apt title for this little film that decides at the onset to remain small. It does offer some of our favorite aging actors the opportunity to redefine friendship in a very tender and warm manner. Is it s a great movie? No, not really, but is it worth watching for the joy of seeing Al Pacino, Christopher Walken and Alan Arkin join talents - most definitely `yes.'Valentino/'Val' (Al Pacino) is an old school, small time, two-bit crook who took the fall for a botched robbery 28 years prior. Being a ""Stand up guy"", Val did his time and kept his mouth shut, and never revealed any information with regards to the crime; he didn't cop a plea, rat out his friends, and he was tried and sentenced to the full extent of the law. Val's best friend and cohort in crime is Doc (Christopher Walken). While in prison and even now as Val prepares to be reintegrated back into society, Doc has always been there for Val. However, Doc has a heavy burden weighing on his conscious. It seems that during all the gunfire shot amid the botched robbery, Val inadvertently shot and killed the only son of the crime syndicates Boss, Claphands (Mark Margolis). Claphands has waited 28 long years for retribution; and Doc has been ordered to execute the hit on Val, and he only has 24 hours to complete the task or suffer repercussions himself for noncompliance.&#8232;In the interim 24 hours we meet the lovely waitress Alex (Addison Timlin)&#8232; who happens to be Doc's granddaughter, the third member of the old gang Hirsch (Alan Arkin) whom Val and Doc rescue from a rest home to spend the night at a brothel run by Wendy (Lucy Punch), Val's experience with impotence at the brothel that leads him to overdose on Viagra he and Doc steal from a pharmacy and that leads to Val's priapism that requires aspiration in a hospital attended by Nina Hirsch (Julianna Margulies) who is Hirsh's daughter, and a final encounter with the thugs of Claphands and Claphands himself as the 24 hour deadline approaches.It is all great fun and even more important is the expression of the bond of friendship between Val and Doc, and with Hirsch.

Unlike another legendary pair-up which fell flat (Pacino with Deniro in Heat & Righteous Kill), Pacino and Walken are really effortless in this.Some critics bemoaned the lack of this or that - Pacino and Walken not dark enough; not enough depth; weak plot and such, but give the guys a break!  This is a minor classic that rises above what could have been just another typical gangster outing.  Most criminal / wiseguy films try too hard and take themselves way too seriously, which this film never does.Stand up Guys endears itself by simply letting the two actors take centerstage with strong scenes and great dialogue.  (I remember when DeNiro and Pacino just didn't have enough screen time together in Heat - one scene and that was it.  It was like Michael Mann feared overkill or competition between the two men.)The chemistry evokes Samuel Jackson and John Travolta in Pulp Fiction - there's an ease and swagger with Pacino wearing the ex-con mantle like his second skin, and Walken playing his faithful, troubled best friend.  Throw in some Alan Arkin (always playing a loony in the movies nowadays) for good measure, and this is about as good as it gets for our all-star 70s team.Yeah, I thought about Pacino in Godfather 2 and how far he's evolved.  He still talks loud like he has for years, but at least it feels like an old comfortable shoe.  I've also never been much of a Walken fan myself but it's one of his best roles.  What more could you ask for?  Kinda like Ali and Frasier fighting for the 3rd time and giving it their best shot. I didn't expect too much from these guys but they surprised me and exceeded expectations.Good direction from Fisher Stevens.  The film is more intelligent than it gets credit for and I loved the look and cinematography.

They repeat the same brothel scene not once but twice - and believe me, the joke is stale the first time.  There is an absolutely meaningless scene of the stars driving a car - there is no motivation for it other than the three want to see how fast the car can go.  And of course it pads the film out.  The script is witty enough to have been written by a fifteen year old with no imagination and even less intelligence.  No one wants to sit through a film about aging gangsters that could hav ebeen written by one in between hits of Alka-Seltzer and warm milk.  Pacino does his ""Scent of a Woman"" schtick in a seedy bar dancing with a young woman - again the scene goes nowhere.  Juliette Margolies is wasted here.  I think we are meant to laugh while Walken recites all the medications he is taking.  Too, the entire premise of the film - that Walken must kill Pacino or face death himself is silly.  Is it so difficult to kill Pacino's character?  Anybody could do it while the character sleepwalks through the streets of whatever godforsaken city the film is situated in.  Arkin's sole reason for being in the film is to get a laugh out of being able to satisfy two women sexually and to drive a car very fast.

1619739,A3IY9HIAMJQ7HL,B00AZMFONG,Marcel Lee,"[0, 0]","The Guys this movie centers around are old crime buddies reunited after one, Val, is released from a 28-year prison stay, so the plot comes across as an epilogue. Their most thrilling days are behind them, but still they manage to get into plenty of mischief in just a matter of hours. The gist is that Doc has been ordered by his crime boss to kill Val by 10-AM, something he's only reluctantly going along with in order to save his own life. Val killed the boss's son before going to prison, and the boss wants revenge, so if Doc backs out, he too will be killed.That revelation brings with it a certain level of underlying tension, despite the fact that Doc immediately admits to Val what's going on the moment he gets suspicious enough to ask about it. And tension, however weak, in a movie is a good thing. The problem is that the plot, which often runs in real time, has nowhere to go from there. 10-AM is the deadline and Doc makes it obvious he's going to wait until then to do it, but the random things they do in the meanwhile; this flick is much better at drama than comedy; only strains the plausibility of the plot.marcellee.com",3,3 of 5,1379548800,"09 19, 2013",2013,1141,"['Guys', 'movie', 'centers', 'around', 'are', 'old', 'crime', 'buddies', 'reunited', 'one', 'Val', 'released', '28-year', 'prison', 'stay', 'plot', 'across', 'epilogue', 'most', 'thrilling', 'days', 'are', 'still', 'manage', 'get', 'plenty', 'mischief', 'just', 'matter', 'hours', 'gist', 'Doc', 'been', 'ordered', 'crime', 'boss', 'kill', 'Val', '10-AM', 'something', 'only', 'reluctantly', 'going', 'along', 'order', 'save', 'own', 'life', 'Val', 'killed', 'boss', 'son', 'going', 'prison', 'boss', 'revenge', 'so', 'Doc', 'out', 'too', 'will', 'be', 'killed.That', 'revelation', 'brings', 'certain', 'level', 'underlying', 'tension', 'fact', 'Doc', 'immediately', 'Val', 'what', 'going', 'moment', 'suspicious', 'enough', 'ask', 'tension', 'however', 'weak', 'movie', 'good', 'thing', 'problem', 'plot', 'often', 'real', 'time', 'nowhere', 'go', 'there', '10-AM', 'deadline', 'Doc', 'obvious', 'going', 'wait', 'then', 'do', 'random', 'things', 'do', 'meanwhile', 'flick', 'much', 'better', 'drama', 'comedy', 'only', 'plausibility', 'plot.marcellee.com']",Stand Up Guys

1619743,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00AZMFONG,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","I grew up watching Al Pacino and Christopher Walken from their early starts to their current films. I've loved almost every character they've played and every movie they've been in. So when I heard that they were going to be in a movie together playing old time mobsters I was delighted. I'm pleased to say that while this movie doesn't offer them at their extreme best, it is a wonderful film that I might find myself tempted to watch again in the future.Pacino plays Val, a low level criminal who is just getting out of prison having served a 28 year sentence for an armed robbery where someone was killed. Walken plays Doc, his best friend, who shows to pick him up and take him back home. But things have changed in the old neighborhood not to mention with the two old cons that have aged over the years.Enjoying his time outside Val doesn't want to go back to Doc's place, he wants to go out on the town and enjoy the life he once knew. He doesn't realize until things happen that he's not who he once was. A visit to the old whorehouse they used to go to finds the new Madame is the old one's grand daughter. An unsuccessful go round for Val leads the duo to break into a pharmacy to steal some Viagra. While there, Doc begins to lift a few other drugs that he now takes on a regular basis. The result of the Viagra lends itself to one of the funniest moments in the film.Val later attempts to hit on a couple young girls at a club thinking he's still the young buck he once was only to get turned down. He's now an old man. As reality sits in he finds new ways to deal with it.Unknown to Val is the fact that Doc, while his friend, has been given the unenviable task of killing him. It seems that the big boss, Claphands, wants Val dead. During the robbery that landed Val in jail, Claphands son was shot by Val in the crossfire. Even though Val took the fall for the whole group, even though he was a stand up guy, Claphands wants him dead.Eventually Val realizes what is going to go down. Rather than fight it, he and Doc set off on a series of adventures in an attempt to live life to the fullest until the fateful hour that Doc has to sign off that he's been killed. Included in those adventures is the rescue from a nursing home of their old wheel man Hirsch (Alan Arkin) who has one of the funniest moments in the film when they return to the whorehouse.What makes this movie so good is the interplay between Pacino and Walken as two friends who have grown old, one who realizes it and has learned to deal with it living on the outside and the other who doesn't at first having been in prison for 28 years. Living those years in a cell Val hasn't seen the world around him change but Doc has. The prescription scene is one that verifies that. But the camaraderie between these two friends and later Hirsch makes up for their differences and unites them as friends, as stand up guys, until the final moments of the film.It's rare that either of the lead actors in this film offer a bad performance and here they once again show why they've always been at the top of the list in their profession. Both bring subtle nuances to their roles that many might not see at first but that bring their characters to life. It might be that the roles they play don't lend themselves to being larger than life parts that will become memorable but what they do with these parts makes them realistic and touching in so many ways.The movie offers many laughs, a heartfelt look at growing old and performances by some of the best actors in the business. It entertains from start to finish and you couldn't ask much more of a movie these days. It may not be a slap in the face effects filled blockbuster of a film but it is one that can be enjoyed more than once.",4,THE GOOD OLD DAYS,1369958400,"05 31, 2013",2013,3756,"['grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'early', 'starts', 'current', 'films', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'almost', 'character', ""'ve"", 'played', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'been', 'when', 'heard', 'were', 'going', 'be', 'movie', 'together', 'playing', 'old', 'time', 'mobsters', 'was', 'delighted', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'say', 'movie', ""n't"", 'offer', 'extreme', 'best', 'wonderful', 'film', 'might', 'find', 'tempted', 'watch', 'again', 'future.Pacino', 'Val', 'low', 'level', 'criminal', 'who', 'just', 'getting', 'prison', 'having', 'served', '28', 'year', 'sentence', 'armed', 'robbery', 'where', 'someone', 'was', 'killed', 'Walken', 'Doc', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'pick', 'up', 'take', 'back', 'home', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'old', 'neighborhood', 'not', 'mention', 'two', 'old', 'cons', 'have', 'aged', 'years.Enjoying', 'time', 'Val', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'back', 'Doc', 'place', 'go', 'out', 'town', 'enjoy', 'life', 'once', 'knew', ""n't"", 'realize', 'things', 'happen', 'not', 'who', 'once', 'was', 'visit', 'old', 'whorehouse', 'used', 'go', 'finds', 'new', 'Madame', 'old', 'one', 'grand', 'daughter', 'unsuccessful', 'go', 'round', 'Val', 'duo', 'break', 'pharmacy', 'steal', 'Viagra', 'there', 'Doc', 'lift', 'few', 'other', 'drugs', 'now', 'regular', 'basis', 'result', 'Viagra', 'one', 'funniest', 'moments', 'film.Val', 'later', 'hit', 'couple', 'young', 'girls', 'club', 'thinking', 'still', 'young', 'buck', 'once', 'was', 'only', 'get', 'turned', 'down', 'now', 'old', 'man', 'reality', 'sits', 'new', 'ways', 'deal', 'it.Unknown', 'Val', 'fact', 'Doc', 'friend', 'been', 'given', 'unenviable', 'task', 'killing', 'big', 'boss', 'Claphands', 'Val', 'dead', 'robbery', 'landed', 'Val', 'jail', 'Claphands', 'son', 'was', 'shot', 'Val', 'crossfire', 'Even', 'Val', 'took', 'fall', 'whole', 'group', 'even', 'was', 'stand', 'up', 'guy', 'Claphands', 'dead.Eventually', 'Val', 'what', 'going', 'go', 'down', 'Rather', 'fight', 'Doc', 'set', 'off', 'series', 'adventures', 'attempt', 'live', 'life', 'fullest', 'fateful', 'hour', 'Doc', 'sign', 'off', 'been', 'killed', 'Included', 'adventures', 'rescue', 'nursing', 'home', 'old', 'wheel', 'man', 'Hirsch', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'who', 'one', 'funniest', 'moments', 'film', 'when', 'return', 'whorehouse.What', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'interplay', 'Pacino', 'Walken', 'two', 'friends', 'who', 'have', 'grown', 'old', 'one', 'who', 'learned', 'deal', 'living', 'outside', 'other', 'who', ""n't"", 'first', 'having', 'been', 'prison', '28', 'years', 'Living', 'years', 'cell', 'Val', ""n't"", 'seen', 'world', 'change', 'Doc', 'prescription', 'scene', 'one', 'camaraderie', 'two', 'friends', 'later', 'Hirsch', 'up', 'differences', 'friends', 'stand', 'up', 'guys', 'final', 'moments', 'film.It', 'rare', 'lead', 'actors', 'film', 'offer', 'bad', 'performance', 'here', 'once', 'again', 'show', 'why', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'top', 'list', 'profession', 'bring', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'roles', 'many', 'might', 'not', 'see', 'first', 'bring', 'characters', 'life', 'might', 'be', 'roles', 'play', 'do', ""n't"", 'lend', 'being', 'larger', 'life', 'parts', 'will', 'become', 'memorable', 'what', 'do', 'parts', 'realistic', 'touching', 'so', 'many', 'ways.The', 'movie', 'offers', 'many', 'laughs', 'heartfelt', 'look', 'growing', 'old', 'performances', 'best', 'actors', 'business', 'start', 'finish', 'could', ""n't"", 'ask', 'much', 'more', 'movie', 'days', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'slap', 'face', 'effects', 'filled', 'blockbuster', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'once']",Stand Up Guys

But do yourself a favor anyway and take a look. From opening to closing, if you love Walken being Walken, Pacino doing his own impersonation, and a script that gives you a little bite out of everything you ever loved about their quirkier movies, you will spend a great 90 minutes here.You could call the film quirky too.  Mostly because of Mr. Pacino's whatchamacallit... I don't know if Amazon will let me use the correct word, so let's just call it Thingy. After an overdose of stolen Viagra, it's almost a co-star.  But salaciousness is just a tiny ingredient in this half-baked but still delicious souffle.  Sure the plot is pointless, serving just as an excuse for our two guys to do some of their favorite shtick, and it goes well beyond blocked vein priapism (in case you wanted to know the medical term).  Walken and Pacino are old time gangsters, from back in the day when being a gangster meant something. Pacino has spent the better part of 30 years in prison. His partner in crime and best friend picks him out outside the walls and they spend a day on the town. Turns out, this is going to be Pacino's last day because his former boss wants him whacked ASAP and it's Walken's job to be the triggerman.Stand Up Guys doesn't miss a trick. We have the Hooker with the Heart of Gold, the Truly Evil Villian, a granddaughter and grandfather reunion, the Geezers who can outshoot, outfight and out (another word I think Ammy might object to) guys half their age.  We have justice and revenge, tables turning, romance and regret.  We have humor, heartbreak, lots of action, dialogue that's a little familiar but enjoyable all the more for that reason, and a car chase that is the only one I have ever loved.  Throw in some good little cameos by Alan Arkin and Juliette Margulies...who also served as director of the flick, and you just have something endearing if not memorable.  Arkin, by the way, is very good, with some great lines.Don't be a critic, don't be picky.

He's awaited by his best friend Doc (played by Christopher Walken). We later find out that Val was in jail for the killing of the son of tough guy Claphands, and that Claphands has hired Doc to take out Val by 10 am the next morning. The movie plays out entirely in the 24 hrs. between Val's release from jail and the next morning. During that time we see the two old buddies ""liven it up"", leading to sometime funny (if at times predictable, as in: Viagra overdose consequences, etc.), and sometimes sentimential moments about the ""bad old days"" (when they get ready to take on some baddies, they look at each other and start humming: ""It's time to kick ass or time to chew gum! but I've run out of gum"", ha!).Several comments: the only plot line that matters in the entire movie is whether at the end Doc takes out Val (I'm not going to tell you how it ends, you'll have to see for yourself how it all plays out). Far more important and enjoyable are the acting performances. Let's start with Al Pacino, who seems like he's having the time of his life and is feisty and fiery throughout. Christopher Walken brings a more restrained, but equally effective, performance. But the person who steals the movie is, once again, Alan Arkin in a fairly small role (he gets rescued/abducted from a seniors home by Val and Doc). Arkin seems to be everywhere these days (he's likely to win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his role in Argo).Bottom line: this movie was okay, but could've been even better with a better script and tighter direction. The theatre where I saw this at here in Cincinnati tonight (1st day of release) was very poorly attended, leading me to believe that it's doubtful this movie will find a large audience. So if you are interested in this movie, better hurry before it's gone (or simply wait for the DVD release later this year).",4,3.5 stars...

Once when the breath leaves our body, and once when the last person we know says our name.""--ValentinoThe 2012 Fisher Stevens film, Stand Up Guys, has a strong cast. Bringing in $3 million at stand up guysthe box office, it was clearly something of a flop. Unfortunately, Al Pacino, Christopher Walken and Alan Arkin might not be the draw they once were. The 95 minute, Rated R mob-like movie was, if anything, consistent. Not great. Not horrible.Valentino, ""Val"" to his friends -- Pacino to you and me, is just released from prison after 28 years locked away. ""Doc"" (Walken) meets him at the gate. Retired made-men, the two head back to Doc's, where a pull-out sofa bed is ready for Val. Having spent his retired days painting sunrises and sunsets, Doc is pretty set in his routine. A little frisky after decades behind bars, Val is hoping to party.Nightclubs, and whore houses, some robbery and plenty of reminiscing is what unfolds. Doc was able to track down his daughter, but not his granddaughter. The regrets of his life apparent in his face, in his words, and even in his actions. Somewhat bitter, Val, was sent to prison and never talked. Never gave anyone up. Took the punishment all on his own.Mark Margolis portrays the mob boss character, Claphands. He has not forgotten Val, or part of why Val was in prison. Claphands' only son was murdered by Val. The only fair thing is revenge. The clock is set. At 10:00 AM, Val will be dead. One way or the other.Enter Alan Arkin as Hirsch. Doc and Val rescue their old time friend from a retirement home. They steal a Mustang, and they paint the town red. That is, until they find a surprise in the trunk of the vehicle. And then participate in serving up some serious justice.Many scenes, I hate to admit are just over acted by Pacino. However, the story continues to move forward.  It is often touching and slightly emotional. It is often humorous and slightly compelling. Overall it is a solid rental, or Netflix kind of film. I did not play with my phone, or scroll statuses on Facebook. It's how I rate a film, people. For these reasons, and the simple respect for the cast, I am giving Stand Up Guys 4 out of 5 stars. Why 4? Because it really was a pretty good film. Not great. But Pretty good.

He was the standout cast member in both the 1986 original film and the 1988 sequel.  Since then, I've only seen him in very brief, somewhat uninspired film appearances.  But, based upon his direction of Stand Up Guys, Mr. Stevens is worthy of very high accolades.  Ben Jabitua may have faded away, but Fisher Stevens, re-emerging as a film director, is orders of magnitude brighter than many who aspire to direct motion pictures.

and pleasant journey with some old pros,making it all look effortless.I never thought I'd be calling the three main stars &#34;old&#34;,but &#34; time waits for no man&#34;,as Pacino says.The story finds Pacino getting out of prison for a 28 year stretch he did for the accidental killing of his bosses son during a heist.The boss,Clap hands,doesn't quite remember it as an accident and has been waiting all those years for revenge on Pacino.Walken is there to greet his old pal who we find out,after they get back to Walken's place,is the one Clap hands has designated as the one to ice Pacino.But Pacino wants to par-tay.Walken takes him to a local brothel the two frequented many years before.In fact the daughter of the original owner now runs it.Oops,but Pacino can't get the pipes working.Off the two go to the local drugstore to get some Viagra,and other sundries Walken needs.Pacino takes a slew  of the pills and not only gets things straight at the brothel but cannot &#34;relax&#34;.They end up at a club and then back in the car where Pacino passes out.Walken tries but cannot bring himself to shoot his old buddy,He wakes him up and they go to the hospital to emerge where the daughter of an old friend, Hirsch,is tending to Pacino's problem.With that fixed they attend a restaurant Walken has frequented for years.They are served by a friendly waitress who Walken has obviously knows quite well.It is then Walken is forced to fess up that it is indeed HE that is the one that is supposed to kill Pacino;by 10AM that morning.After their meal they steal a souped up car from some local scum bag hoodlums,&#34;animals&#34; as Walken calls them,and they look up their old pal Hirsch(Arkin),who used to be their getaway driver.Hirsch is now on oxygen but is very glad to see his old pals.The two talk Hirsch into driving their newly acquired car for them.While out they get set on by the police.After a brief chase Hirsch easily loses them.Next they head to the brothel,where Hirsch wants to have a three some.With the deed done the three head back onto the road.Not soon after they hear a banging from the trunk.It turns out to be a naked girl.They take her to the diner and get her something to eat.She explains that she was kidnapped by this gang and raped at a warehouse, then put in the trunk.Pacino and Walken say there must be consequences for such despicable behaviour,so they drive back and find the place where it happened.The girl is determined to come in with them but they finally persuade her to stay out for about ten minutes until things are under control.The two storm in and subdue all five guys,most tied up, with one on the floor.The girl comes in with a baseball bat and Pacino and Walken leave her to do her thing.Back at the car the two find their old friend dead at the wheel.They go back to the hospital and tell his daughter what has happened.She agrees to Pacino's request to bury him that night.After a brief ceremony the two return to the diner.There Pacino guesses that the waitress Walken is so fond of is his granddaughter.While Walken makes a call to Clap hands for some clemency,his granddaughter sits down to talk to Pacino about her friend.Needless to say Clap hands isn't in a forgiving mood and holds Walken to his job.Walken writes a note to his granddaughter and pins the note,along with his apartment keys,to the bulletin board next to the phone and both men leave.Next the two stop off at a church where Pacino goes to confession.Their next stop is a clothing store,where they both pick up some new suits.Part way through two of Clap hands thugs enter and Walken and Pacino  subdue them both,leaving one wounded in the hand and the other to send back to their boss.Meanwhile the waitress is now in Walken's apartment and the phone rings.She picks it up and Walken tells her that he loves her,and to get a shoe box in his closet.It is filled with cash.Walken tells her the unit is now hers and that some very beautiful paintings of sunrises he had done over the years were all inspired by her.Asked  if she will see him soon,he replies he doesn't know and hangs up.The two now head down to Clap hands warehouse where they start a fire fight with two thugs outside then train their fire on Clap hands upstairs.As the gun fight continues the camera pans upward and over the building to a beautiful sunset,which then solidifies into one of Walken's paintings.The major element that binds this film together is the chemistry between the two main leads,and Walken and Pacino have it from start to finish.Walken is continually torn between the respect he has for his old partner and the terrible job that Clap hands is forcing him to do.You can see it in his face at all times.And Pacino knows that his time is limited and tries to enjoy what little time he has,knowing all along it is his buddy that has to do the job.At one point he even breaks down thinking about it, in a vulnerable moment.Every other actor that comes on and off screen are strong and match the vibes of of both men,from Hirsch,Hirsch's daughter,Walkens granddaughter,the thugs,etc.The film takes place over about a 20 hour arc,counting the time from which Pacino walks out of jail.It is a well paced but steady progression as we wonder what the ending will be to all of the circumstances before us.The ending will come as kind of a cheat to some,but in retrospect it is fitting and smart,leaving it to our imaginations.Technically speaking the film is in its original a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp .Extras include deleted scenes,interviews with the cast,a look at the stunt driving,behind the scenes,two featurettes and a look at some of Bon Jovi's music.All in all a delightful film with two pros doing what comes naturally.There is great chemistry all around and the film fits like an old sweater.Recommended.4-4 1/2 stars.",4,Old school does it right,1398556800,"04 27, 2014",2014,5987,"['Stand', 'up', 'guys',

1619807,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00AZMFONG,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 2]","**1/2I guess that ""Stand Up Guys"" is intended to be Al Pacino and Christopher Walken's version of ""The Bucket List,"" since apparently every aging male movie star is required to have one before wrapping up his career. And true to the body of work of these two seminal actors, this outing takes the form of a crime comedy/drama, in which they portray geriatric gangsters, one (Walken) retired and the other (Pacino) just paroled after 28 years in the slammer (I use the word ""slammer"" intentionally in an attempt to capture at least some of the anachronistic flavor of this throwback to a bygone era of gangster-movie melodrama). It turns out that Walken has only been allowed to live all these years on the condition that he whack Pacino for killing the only son of an equally decrepit mob boss played by Mark Margolis.The humor in Noah Haidle's screenplay consists mainly of jokes about the men's various ailments (with a special emphasis on impotence) and medications.  When they're not trying to procure Viagra, they're lamenting the good old days, banging hookers, or going off on little escapades like breaking their buddy (Alan Arkin) out of a retirement home for some just-for-old-times-sake ""tough guy"" fun-and-games on the road.Directed by Fisher Stevens, the movie feels as wheezy and creaky as the characters it's depicting. The whole thing is based on the premise that there's nothing quite so amusing or heartwarming as watching an assortment of septuagenarians behaving as if they were still in their 20s. The result is patronizing and condescending to both the actors and the members of the audience regardless of their ages.There's also a sequence at a cemetery (with a hapless Julianna Margulies bearing witness to it) that's a strong contender for Least Plausible Scene of the Year Award.As to the performers themselves, Walken's effective underplaying is not sufficient to counteract Pacino's endless scenery-chewing.And while it's nice to see actors of a certain age getting movie roles these days, does it have to be in a vehicle of roughly the same vintage?",2,"Out of respect for the stars, take a pass on this movie",1374624000,"07 24, 2013",2013,2078,"['**1/2I', 'guess', 'Stand', 'Up', 'Guys', 'intended', 'be', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'version', 'Bucket', 'List', 'apparently', 'aging', 'male', 'movie', 'star', 'required', 'have', 'one', 'wrapping', 'up', 'career', 'true', 'body', 'work', 'two', 'seminal', 'actors', 'outing', 'form', 'crime', 'comedy/drama', 'portray', 'geriatric', 'gangsters', 'one', 'Walken', 'retired', 'other', 'Pacino', 'just', 'paroled', '28', 'years', 'slammer', 'use', 'word', 'slammer', 'intentionally', 'attempt', 'capture', 'least', 'anachronistic', 'flavor', 'throwback', 'bygone', 'era', 'gangster-movie', 'melodrama', 'out', 'Walken', 'only', 'been', 'allowed', 'live', 'years', 'condition', 'whack', 'Pacino', 'killing', 'only', 'son', 'equally', 'decrepit', 'mob', 'boss', 'played', 'Mark', 'Margolis.The', 'humor', 'Noah', 'Haidle', 'screenplay', 'mainly', 'jokes', 'men', 'various', 'ailments', 'special', 'emphasis', 'impotence', 'medications', 'When', ""'re"", 'not', 'trying', 'procure', 'Viagra', ""'re"", 'lamenting', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'banging', 'hookers', 'going', 'off', 'little', 'escapades', 'breaking', 'buddy', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'retirement', 'home', 'just-for-old-times-sake', 'tough', 'guy', 'fun-and-games', 'road.Directed', 'Fisher', 'Stevens', 'movie', 'feels', 'wheezy', 'creaky', 'characters', 'depicting', 'whole', 'thing', 'based', 'premise', 'nothing', 'quite', 'so', 'amusing', 'heartwarming', 'watching', 'assortment', 'septuagenarians', 'behaving', 'were', 'still', '20s', 'result', 'patronizing', 'condescending', 'actors', 'members', 'audience', 'regardless', 'ages.There', 'also', 'sequence', 'cemetery', 'hapless', 'Julianna', 'Margulies', 'bearing', 'witness', 'strong', 'contender', 'Least', 'Plausible', 'Scene', 'Year', 'Award.As', 'performers', 'Walken', 'effective', 'underplaying', 'not', 'sufficient', 'counteract', 'Pacino', 'endless', 'scenery-chewing.And', 'nice', 'see', 'actors', 'certain', 'age', 'getting', 'movie', 'roles', 'days', 'have', 'be', 'vehicle', 'roughly', 'same', 'vintage']",Stand Up Guys

They just aren't the dream team of aged outlaws for this story for me and is what's so wrong with this movie along with the script.

It spits, sputters, coughs and spews raw fuel at it crawls along trying to be funny, touching, tough and in the end needed, but dies alongside the road with it's flashers on waiting for a tow.

1619829,A1DUT6O3BWXEJ,B00AZMFONG,"Shawn Gordon ""gordy the ghoul""","[3, 5]","With Stand-up Guys we are given three great actors in three great performances. The fact that they are not necessarily great roles is really beside the point. The stars have enough personality and we enough affection for them to overcome most obstacles, let alone such a minor one.Stand-up Guys is a movie that depends on so much on it's performers more than anything else, really. Directed by actor Fisher Stevens, it's easy enough to assume that he loves actors, but that he knows when to stay out of the way of these actors is a testament to his craft.Stand-up Guys could be easily dismissed as a ""grump old gangsters"". However, that would be missing the point and the amusement to be found here. A funny movie, but not absurdly so, it's not a laugh riot. But it doesn't need to be, it's charming and humorous enough.Working from a rather leaden script by Noah Halde. None of this matters because the talented cast knows how to rise above the material and thus carry the movie further than the material.Unlike a lot of recent similar themed movies, Stand-up Guys does not feature aging actors acting as though time has stood still. In fact, much of Stand-up Guys depends upon their ages. It's able to be a mediation on death, friendship, loyalty and the inevitable passage of time. It's rather poignant in it's own way.Watching these actors I realized just how important to me hey re, I've been watching them o decades. Now, Stand-up Guys makes us realize that we are watching them enter into their twilight, soon they will fade from our screens, but not our hearts. A movie like Stand-up Guys  is really more about us the audience re living something.Pacino plays Val, who as the movie starts is just realized from prison. He served 28 years for the accidental killing of a mobster's son during a heist, h didn`t rat out his accomplices because he's a stand-up guy . There to meet him is one of his old cronies, Doc (Walken), who is possible his only friend.Val wants to ""party"", Doc says he's retired, not just from being a thief from everything else. Of course, this doesn't stop from breaking into just about every place he goes, but it's mostly places like a pharmacy ""my co-pay on this one is insane"".Val knows the gangster who's son he killed will have him killed. He knows that Doc has been ordered to it. But this isn't about him trying to out wit or out gun his old friend. He just wants to have one last good time. He knows if he doesn't do it, someone else will anyway.So the two head into the night in a serious of unlikely events, but they are fun to watch none the less. They  spring their other buddy, they're former getaway driver, Hirsch (Arkin). Not from prison, but from the nursing home that he lives in. They need a driver to go into the night.This leads to a lot of cute and funny situations. Like an improbable car chase on the freeway with the police. I am so burnt out on car chases, but this one is different. It's not about the getaway or the chase, but who's driving.Stand-up Guys doesn't depend so much on it's story as it does on it's personalities. And there is personality to spare. This is Pacino and Walken's movie, both at the top of their form, the best I've seen them in years. Arkin adds support in a smaller role, but it is amazing how he lights up the screen, and has been doing so wonderfully lately in a serious of excellent films.I also like that Stand-up Guys comes to it's logical conclusion, in an ending that is perfectly handled and fitting. So many fine movies are ruined by a third act that is forced or contrived. The dreaded third act problem, as I like to call it. But not here, the ending is most correct.You will notice that I am giving Stand-up Guys four stars, despite some rather immense flaws. But the truth is that while I watched Stand-up Guys, I was never aware of them. The actors held my attention, I was so captivate by their mesmerizing work as to be lost to everything else.The story may be obvious. The movie is predictable. But never once did I find myself actually thinking about it. I was to busy watching the people on screen, the actors make them flesh and blood.The late George C.

1619840,A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM,B00AZMFONG,Stanley Crowe,"[0, 0]","What is it that makes ""Standup Guys"" work as a comedy? You might have noticed in the movie allusions to other movies -- ""Scent of a Woman"" was one I caught, and the aging Randolph Scott and Joel McCrea in ""Ride the High Country"" seemed to be alluded to at the end. There's even, I think, a perverse allusion to ""The Untouchables."" I'm sure people who have seen more movies than I have caught more. You'll remember the Shakespeare plots that are premised on an outrageous demand? -- ""Marry the man I want you to marry or you'll have to be put to death"" (""Midsummer Night's Dream""), for example. Here Doc (Christopher Walken) has been ordered by his former boss, Claphands (Mark Margolis, looking like Ron Paul!), to kill his old friend Val (Pacino) when he (Val) finishes up his 28 year prison sentence. Claphands believes Val to have been responsible for the death of his son during a shoot-out with police, and while it seems unlikely that Val really killed the young man, he took the fall and didn't rat out the others. In other words, he's a standup guy, and yet Claphands -- 28 years on, for heaven's sake -- wants him dead and wants his best friend to kill him. Premises don't get much more outrageous than that. The action of the movie takes place in the day, approximately, between Val's release and the time of Claphands's deadline. Val learns about his predicament early in the movie and accepts that Doc will have to kill him.What clues us to the fact that we're not in the world of ""realism,"" however, is the fact that neither Doc nor Val spend the rest of the movie trying to solve the problem. There is no ""plot"" -- the sequence of events is just a piece of machinery that enables the main characters to get together and do a lot of talking. They spend a lot of time in a diner in which Doc's grand-daughter is a waitress who doesn't know that the old regular that she serves frequently is her grandfather. There are visits to a brothel that doesn't look like any brothel of the present day, the madam of which is young woman who looks like a stereotypical movie secretary and where Eastern-European prostitutes seem happy in their work. Val and Doc ""rescue"" their old buddy Hirsch (Alan Arkin) from an assisted-living facility. When they walk in, he's hooked up to an oxygen tank, and when he sees them, he just unhooks it, walks out, and takes them for a joyride in a stolen car that belongs to a couple of gangsters. Inside the trunk, after a bit of joyriding, they find a naked girl named Sylvia (Vanessa Ferlito), whom they free, feed, and then give a hilarious opportunity to get back at the gangsters who kidnapped her. Then they find Hirsch dead at the wheel. Then they bury him, with the help of his daughter Nina (Julianna Margulies), a nurse who had earlier helped Val when he had had to be hospitalized following a Viagra overdose. Then they steal some suits. Then they go to church, and Val tips the priest for trying to hear his confession . . . I think you might realize that we're in something like Coen Brothers or Bill Forsythe country. Of course, we realize that Claphands can't be avoided . . . but we notice too that nothing that Val and Doc actually DO seems to directed at solving the Claphands problem, even though they frequently discuss their predicament.So what's the point? It is, I think, all about performance. It's clear fairly early that ""standup guy"" is a double-entendre. The comedy of Val's ""performance"", or lack thereof, in the brothel sets the tone, and on a later visit to the brothel with Hirsch, we see another kind of performance -- one of the most charming moments in the movie, in which we realize, if we think about it, that it's all about acting. And so is the movie -- the inconsequential actions that make up the ""plot"" exist solely to show us that two old actors can hold our attention in these moments. Whatever tone a scene requires, they're up for it, and they can seemingly shift at will. The dialogue is fresh: my favorite line might be ""Who made you the arbiter of who has to give away their pants?"" That could be right out of a Bill Forsythe movie. And Pacino and Walken (and Arkin when he's with them) are magical. The lighting does nothing to hide (in fact accentuates) the ravages of age, but whatever kind of performances might deteriorate with age, acting performances aren't necessarily among them. Although Walken goes through most of the movie looking like death warmed over, the movie is in fact a cheerful tribute to old movies, old actors, and absurd plots that we can be charmed in spite of. As for the ending, you can make of it (as Shakespeare might say) ""what you will.""",4,performance art?,1404864000,"07 9, 2014",2014,4654,"['What', 'Standup', 'Guys', 'work', 'comedy', 'might', 'have', 'noticed', 'movie', 'allusions', 'other', 'movies', 'Scent', 'Woman', 'was', 'one', 'caught', 'aging', 'Randolph', 'Scott', 'Joel', 'McCrea', 'Ride', 'High', 'Country', 'seemed', 'be', 'alluded', 'end', 'even', 'think', 'perverse', 'allusion', 'Untouchables', ""'m"", 'sure', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'movies', 'have', 'caught', 'more', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'Shakespeare', 'plots', 'are', 'premised', 'outrageous', 'demand', 'Marry', 'man', 'want', 'marry', ""'ll"", 'have', 'be', 'put', 'death', 'Midsummer', 'Night', 'Dream', 'example', 'Here', 'Doc', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'been', 'ordered', 'former', 'boss', 'Claphands', 'Mark', 'Margolis', 'looking', 'Ron', 'Paul', 'kill', 'old', 'friend', 'Val', 'Pacino', 'when', 'Val', '28', 'year', 'prison', 'sentence', 'Val', 'have', 'been', 'responsible', 'death', 'son', 'shoot-out', 'police', 'unlikely', 'Val', 'really', 'killed', 'young', 'man', 'took', 'fall', 'did', ""n't"", 'rat', 'out', 'others', 'other', 'words', 'standup', 'guy', 'yet', 'Claphands', '28', 'years', 'heaven', 'sake', 'dead', 'best', 'friend', 'kill', 'Premises', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'more', 'outrageous', 'action', 'movie', 'place', 'day', 'approximately', 'Val', 'release', 'time', 'Claphands', 'deadline', 'Val', 'predicament', 'early', 'movie', 'accepts', 'Doc', 'will', 'have', 'kill', 'him.What', 'fact', ""'re"", 'not', 'world', 'realism', 'however', 'fact', 'Doc', 'Val', 'spend', 'rest', 'movie', 'trying', 'solve', 'problem', 'plot', 'sequence', 'events', 'just', 'piece', 'machinery', 'main', 'characters', 'get', 'together', 'do', 'lot', 'talking', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'diner', 'Doc', 'grand-daughter', 'waitress', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'old', 'regular', 'frequently', 'grandfather', 'are', 'visits', 'brothel', ""n't"", 'look', 'brothel', 'present', 'day', 'madam', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'stereotypical', 'movie', 'secretary', 'where', 'Eastern-European', 'prostitutes', 'seem', 'happy', 'work', 'Val', 'Doc', 'rescue', 'old', 'buddy', 'Hirsch', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'assisted-living', 'facility', 'When', 'walk', 'hooked', 'up', 'oxygen', 'tank', 'when', 'just', 'out', 'joyride', 'stolen', 'car', 'couple', 'gangsters', 'trunk', 'bit', 'joyriding', 'find', 'naked', 'girl', 'named', 'Sylvia', 'Vanessa', 'Ferlito', 'whom', 'free', 'feed', 'then', 'give', 'hilarious', 'opportunity', 'get', 'back', 'gangsters', 'who', 'kidnapped', 'Then', 'find', 'Hirsch', 'dead', 'wheel', 'Then', 'bury', 'help', 'daughter', 'Nina', 'Julianna', 'Margulies', 'nurse', 'who', 'had', 'earlier', 'helped', 'Val', 'when', 'had', 'had', 'be', 'hospitalized', 'following', 'Viagra', 'overdose', 'Then', 'steal', 'suits', 'Then', 'go', 'church', 'Val', 'priest', 'trying', 'hear', 'confession', 'think', 'might', 'realize', ""'re"", 'something', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'Bill', 'Forsythe', 'country', 'course', 'realize', 'Claphands', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'avoided', 'notice', 'too', 'nothing', 'Val', 'Doc', 'actually', 'DO', 'directed', 'solving', 'Claphands', 'problem', 'even', 'frequently', 'discuss', 'predicament.So', 'what', 'point', 'think', 'performance', 'clear', 'fairly', 'early', 'standup', 'guy', 'double-entendre', 'comedy', 'Val', 'performance', 'lack', 'thereof', 'brothel', 'tone', 'later', 'visit', 'brothel', 'Hirsch', 'see', 'kind', 'performance', 'one', 'most', 'charming', 'moments', 'movie', 'realize', 'think', 'acting', 'so', 'movie', 'inconsequential', 'actions', 'make', 'up', 'plot', 'exist', 'solely', 'show', 'two', 'old', 'actors', 'can', 'hold', 'attention', 'moments', 'tone', 'scene', ""'re"", 'up', 'can', 'seemingly', 'shift', 'will', 'dialogue', 'fresh', 'favorite', 'line', 'might', 'be', 'Who', 'made', 'arbiter', 'who', 'give', 'away', 'pants', 'could', 'be', 'right', 'Bill', 'Forsythe', 'movie', 'Pacino', 'Walken', 'Arkin', 'when', 'are', 'magical', 'lighting', 'nothing', 'hide', 'fact', 'accentuates', 'ravages', 'age', 'kind', 'performances', 'might', 'deteriorate', 'age', 'acting', 'performances', 'are', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'Walken', 'most', 'movie', 'looking', 'death', 'warmed', 'movie', 'fact', 'cheerful', 'tribute', 'old', 'movies', 'old', 'actors', 'absurd', 'plots', 'can', 'be', 'charmed', 'spite', 'ending', 'can', 'make', 'Shakespeare', 'might', 'say', 'what', 'will']",Stand Up Guys

What we get is a series of boring escapades of booze, prostitutes, car theft, etc.  Of course they haven't lost their scandalous touch with age and for the convience of performing heroics.  I was falling asleep less than halfway through it. This movies only purpose appears to be a payday for some great actors that are a shell of what they once were.

Unfortunately, Stand Up Guys is a disaster.Al Pacino and Christopher Walken try their best, but they have nothing to work with here. The script is awful and the two characters are lifeless, undeveloped, and have absolutely no chemistry with one another. The writing is surprisingly bad too with more than a handful of awful jokes that become increasingly irritating to listen to. There is a Viagra joke early on in the movie that is not only not funny, but has been ton a million times in other movies. Even worse, they milk the joke dry by forcibly bringing it up constantly within the first 30 minutes of the film. Alan Arkin has a very small role in the film and one of the few scenes he's in was one of the few parts I actually enjoyed in the film. The whole film is pretty much 90 minutes of &#34;OH LOOK HOW OLD THESE ACTORS ARE HA HA HA&#34;, except none of the jokes are well-written and the film has no build up or pay off. It just keeps going on and on until it leads up to one of the worst most anti-climatic endings I've ever seen.
