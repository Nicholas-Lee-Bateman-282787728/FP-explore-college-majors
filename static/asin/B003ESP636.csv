As one reviewer said, yes it has cussing in it - some in the church (And in my lifetime, I've heard someone curse in the church. Did I agree with it - no but it happens.  Folk also lie and lust in the church. Come on let's keep it real - no church is perfect. No person is perfect. Kids age 13 and older hear cussing and see things on the TV and in the neighborhood, and at church.  The main topic of the movie is a parent, who happens to be a pastor has a strong hold on his daughter, who is over 21, because his wife died and she stepped in to help him with some things his wife was doing. He's very dependent on her, and don't want her to go out and enjoy life - not even a simple movie so she gets fed up and leaves home.  She had to learn the hard way that life isn't so easy and she returns to her first love - God and her family.Parents it's up to you to allow your kids to see this. You can watch it with them and explain different situations so they won't be naive to the world when they get out of there teaching the boys to be young men and the girls to carry themselves as young ladies.

The movie is rated pg-13 for many things including sexual situations, cursing, and drug use.  Honestly, I can see why the writer needed to include the sexual situations and the drug use to show how the main character was having a hard time.  However, the language is ridiculous.  It included words like d--n, h--l, a--, etc.  If I am not mistaken, there were over 10 curse words in the movie.  Also the main character in the movie really never repents for her sins.  I guess the writer just expects us to know that she did it behind the scenes.  One thing that really disturbed me in this movie also was some of the very first curse words in the movie were said in a church.  I highly recommend you to buy some other film worth watching like fireproof, facing the giants, love comes softly, etc.  Something with a good message, clean movie, that brings glory to God.

1338752,A22RZG1NQ0WAUX,B003ESP636,Katrina L. Burchett,"[3, 4]","Ever since Bishop King's wife passed away his daughter, Angie, has been the one to take care of him. Now she's over twenty-one and ready to experience life. She loves him and her church but she wants to do more, see more. Bishop King hears his daughter tell him that she wants to travel with a Gospel play, but he can't handle the choice she wants to make and he doesn't want to let her go. Hurtful words are spoken and Angie leaves without his blessing.Angie didn't want to be part of the Gospel Fest her church choir was preparing for. No, she was looking for her big break. She thought being part of a Gospel play was going to be just like church; singin', praisin' and preachin'. She also thought traveling with the Gospel play was a way to get close to Devlin, who was one of the performers. She was about to learn some serious life lessons.Be careful! Watch out for attacks from the Devil, your great enemy. He prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for some victim to devour.  - 1 Peter 5:8 (New Living Translation)Angie: Devlin was the person Satan used to try to pull her down. It was good that she had the courage to go out on her own, but even though she thought she was grown she was very nave. She didn't know Devlin more than a minute when she told him she trusted him. She was in for a rude awakening after that. She got off track for a good while -lost sight of who she was in Christ Jesus- and I felt really bad for her, but, like the prodigal son, she did find her way back to God and the people who loved her. I was so glad when she came back to her senses.Bishop King: He was trying to keep his daughter from growing up and that wasn't wise. She was over twenty-one and he still wanted to ground her for being disobedient. I believe he was controlling because he was afraid to be left alone. He learned some lessons of his own while his daughter was gone and God showed him that Angie wasn't the only one who could be there for him.Devlin: Appearances can definitely be deceiving. Young women really need to understand that just because a man looks good that doesn't mean he'll be good for them. Devlin wasn't a real man at all. He needed to make himself feel like `somebody' by making Angie feel like she was a `nobody'. A real man will never raise his hands to a woman. He was arrogant on the outside, but totally insecure. He had serious issues.Wynton: He is the kind of man every woman needs and when he did what he did back stage I applauded him. Angie should have stayed home and gave him a chance instead of taking him for granted. He would have shown her all the respect she deserved and treated her like his queen.Peaches: I liked her a lot. She was a true friend to Angie and she was funny.Marcia: I liked her, too. She was a lively young woman who kept me smiling. She made a few comments, though, about going to Hell because of certain acts. I'm sure she was just playing because as a Christian she had to know that going to Hell or Heaven has nothing to do with works (Ephesians 2:8,9). She also used the d word a couple of times. I wasn't bothered by it; we're all a work in progress. However, one of those times was in the house of the Lord after the service. I'm thinkin' she was so caught up in conversation that she forgot where she was.Desiree: She was cruel to Angie. It was a good thing for her that it wasn't in Angie's heart to be the same way, because she wouldn't have gotten the help she needed during her time of distress. She examined herself after that and I was glad to see the change.Rae'Ven Larrymore Kelly (Lily in Winter, Touched by An Angel, A Time to Kill, What's Love Got to Do With It) played Marcia; it was nice to see her again after so many years, as well as Ella Joyce (Roc) and Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs (Cooley High, Welcome Back Kotter, the Jacksons: An American Dream). Dawnn Lewis (A Different World, Hangin' With Mr. Cooper,The Secret Life of An American Teenager) plays a business woman in deleted scenes. These scenes seemed significant to the story so I don't understand why they were cut. Essence Atkins (Smart Guy, Half & Half, Are We There Yet) is a beautiful, talented woman and I'm glad she was in this movie. Tammy Townsend (Family Matters, Sherri, Lincoln Heights) has a beautiful singing voice and her acting skills are superb. I enjoyed listening to Kiki Sheard sing. I've looked for Sharif Atkins in films and television ever since ER, so it was nice to see him in this movie. I was never really into Destiny's Child so I didn't know who Letoya Luckett was but now I do. She did a very good job. And Tank - another person I wasn't familiar with - did an excellent job. I'm sure Devlin was not supposed to be likeable and he wasn't. Even as pitiful as he looked in the end, I couldn't feel bad for him.Christians aren't perfect people living perfect lives. Nobody is perfect. If we were there would be no need for Jesus. Yes, Christians should be living our lives for the Lord and yes, others should be able to see Christ in us. But, unfortunately, Christians don't always listen when God speaks or live life in the spirit they way we should. Distractions come or we get caught up in circumstances that are beyond our control or that we created ourselves. Stuff happens and we mess up like human beings do, but the thing about mistakes is to learn from them and with Christians after the trouble is over there is usually spiritual growth. Angie learned some hard lessons out there in the world and when she returned home I saw that as repentance.Preacher's Kid is realistic. I enjoyed it and highly recommend it, especially to young women. They should watch this movie and pay close attention to every single mistake Angie made and learn from them so they won't make the same bad choices.",4,The Freedom To Make Mistakes,1283904000,"09 8,

Here, I come from the perspective of the hard lessons Angie learned in this movie.  If you're one that can learn from others, you can gain some things here.  Angie is the daughter of a Bishop, is past the legal age to be living at home, but her father's high expectations of her and her rigid schedule of church responsibilities has her feeling held back and wanting more.Angie ends up meeting a man who seduces her by saying the right things, spending some money on her and showing her some glimpses of life in the spotlight.  Once he has her, a very different side of him shows, but Angie hangs on with hopes that he will turn out to be who she wants him to be.  She loses her self-respect doing this, others around her know what's happening, but she avoids admitting this to herself. I think unfortunately too often some of us women have had relationships where we know we aren't with the right man, aren't being treated with respect and love, but still we hang on, hoping the personality we saw when we first met the man is really who he is.What happens beyond this point in the movie, I'll omit as I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet. LeToya Luckett, a two-time Grammy Award-winning American R&B; singer and songwriter, does a pretty good acting job here and is a fine singer.  Gregory Alan Williams plays the role of Angie's father and I must say he played it very convincingly.  All in all, a movie that covers some life lessons very well, has a lot of good music in it.  Let me say I wish I would have bought it rather than just rented it, because I'll watch it again soon.",4,A Movie Every Young Lady Should Watch,1330732800,"03 3, 2012",2012,1671,"['really', 'think', 'movie', 'young', 'lady', 'should', 'watch', 'Here', 'come', 'perspective', 'hard', 'lessons', 'Angie', 'learned', 'movie', ""'re"", 'one', 'can', 'learn', 'others', 'can', 'gain', 'things', 'here', 'Angie', 'daughter', 'Bishop', 'legal', 'age', 'be', 'living', 'home', 'father', 'high', 'expectations', 'rigid', 'schedule', 'church', 'responsibilities', 'feeling', 'held', 'back', 'wanting', 'more.Angie', 'up', 'meeting', 'man', 'who', 'saying', 'right', 'things', 'spending', 'money', 'showing', 'glimpses', 'life', 'spotlight', 'Once', 'very', 'different', 'side', 'shows', 'Angie', 'hangs', 'hopes', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'who', 'be', 'self-respect', 'doing', 'others', 'know', 'what', 'happening', 'admitting', 'herself', 'think', 'unfortunately', 'too', 'often', 'women', 'have', 'had', 'relationships', 'where', 'know', 'are', ""n't"", 'right', 'man', 'are', ""n't"", 'being', 'treated', 'respect', 'love', 'still', 'hang', 'hoping', 'personality', 'saw', 'when', 'first', 'met', 'man', 'really', 'who', 'point', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'omit', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'LeToya', 'Luckett', 'two-time', 'Grammy', 'Award-winning', 'American', 'R', 'B', 'singer', 'songwriter', 'pretty', 'good', 'acting', 'job', 'here', 'fine', 'singer', 'Gregory', 'Alan', 'Williams', 'role', 'Angie', 'father', 'must', 'say', 'played', 'very', 'convincingly', 'movie', 'life', 'lessons', 'very', 'well', 'lot', 'good', 'music', 'Let', 'say', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'bought', 'rather', 'just', 'rented', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'again', 'soon']",N/A
