He was astoundingly funny. This DVD definitely captures his comic genius, although it is woefully short compared to the amazing talent that he is and that he expressed in the huge amount of material he developed.It was incredibly sad to see that he took his own life which, from what I heard, was based at least in part on the fact that he was not able to get the gigs he used to get, which is itself really sad. He developed what I think is the best comedy, which is comedy that stings and bites because it reveals us human beings as full of weaknesses that are, ultimately, pretty stupid in the face of everything good in this world.He will be sorely missed in this world that needs more people to show us all the dumb things we do...and by doing so, how we should and can be a lot better than we are.",5,One of the best comedians ever,1177632000,"04 27, 2007",2007,932,"['had', 'distinct', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'Richard', 'Jeni', 'live', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'got', 'ta', 'tell', 'really', 'almost', 'peed', 'pants', 'was', 'astoundingly', 'funny', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'comic', 'genius', 'woefully', 'short', 'compared', 'amazing', 'talent', 'expressed', 'huge', 'amount', 'material', 'was', 'incredibly', 'sad', 'see', 'took', 'own', 'life', 'what', 'heard', 'was', 'based', 'least', 'part', 'fact', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'get', 'gigs', 'used', 'get', 'really', 'sad', 'developed', 'what', 'think', 'best', 'comedy', 'comedy', 'stings', 'bites', 'human', 'beings', 'full', 'weaknesses', 'are', 'ultimately', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'face', 'everything', 'good', 'world.He', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'missed', 'world', 'more', 'people', 'show', 'dumb', 'things', 'do', 'doing', 'so', 'how', 'should', 'can', 'be', 'lot', 'better', 'are']",Richard Jeni: A Big Steaming Pile Of Me

Amato ""linda martial arts""","[0, 0]","Not only was this the final appearance of the late Richard Jeni, but it was also his funniest. sheer perfection in observational study. Now don't get me wrong, A Good Catholic Boy is probably just as funny, but with the addition of politics and world turmoil with terrorist attacks he really covers the gamat of some important issues. He did 4 major standups and all were good. But these last two is where he honed his trade. And as of late his family has tried to release anything he has put out. including a new cd of some unreleased material. So go to the official website for all the other dvd's. It supports his family estate. And most of these are no longer available through other sources. But Big Steaming Pile of Me is and so go ahead and place your order. Sit back when it arrives and pay tribute to one of the funniest comedians ever to grace a stage and microphone. Each stand up is completely different. there is no recycling of material.

This, his final HBO special, affected me as it did most people intelligent enough to recognize great humor when they see & hear it: I laughed out loud, and often, probably waking my upstairs neighbors. I always knew Richard was funny from seeing his various TV appearances and his bits in movies, but I didn't realize he was capable of an hour-long HBO special that had me in STITCHES. If you get this DVD, you won't be disappointed. The only disappointment I feel now--in addition to the pain of grieving over his loss--is not having seen him in a live concert setting. His death, for me, is right up there with the untimely loss of other comedy greats: John Belushi. Bill Hix. John Candy. Phil Hartman. Chris Farley. Sam Kinison.Rest in peace, Rich.

I was lucky enough to have seen him live twice at Banana's Comedy Club at the Holiday Inn in NJ, and he was great both times.  He had an awesome ability to go off on tangents, whether dealing with hecklers or just making observations about people in the crowd.  Sometimes it felt like you were hanging out with a hilarious buddy rather than watching a paid comic with pre-written material.  At one point in the show the first time I saw him (which was his Platypus tour), after he had already gone massively overtime, he said he didn't have anywhere to go that night, so he was just going to keep talking until he got tired, and maybe all of us (he and the audience of over a hundred) should all just get a room to continue his act.  lolThat genius is clearly evident in this special.  I just wish they would re-release his other two specials, so a new generation of audiences can learn to love him like I and my friends do.Such a unique talent who will always be missed.
