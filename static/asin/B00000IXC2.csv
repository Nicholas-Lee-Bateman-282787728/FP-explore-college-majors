505124,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B00000IXC2,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[2, 2]","A mummy movie is possibly the easiest kind of horror movie to make -- it comes to life and terrorizes the living. Simple, but effective.And yet &#34;The Eternal: Kiss of the Mummy&#34; (aka &#34;Trance&#34;) has managed to screw that simple formula up. Despite the ever-interesting presence of Christopher Walken and some pretty cinematography, the story itself is a flaccid, flabby mess of plot holes and basic writing errors -- including some of the least sympathetic characters I've ever seen in a movie.Nora (Alison Elliott) and Jim (Jared Harris) are a pair of wealthy alcoholics in New York, who have decided to dry out on a visit to her grandmother in Ireland. Yes, they plan to dry out in the land of Guinness, because apparently it doesn't count as booze. But when they arrive, Nora immediately blacks out and crashes the car.And it keeps getting better -- her grandmother has that highly selected senility you only see in movies, and her weird uncle Bill (Walken) only seems interested in the bog-preserved mummy of a druid witch who murder-suicided in the Iron Age. Of course, the mummy comes back to life... for no reason that's ever explained... and she looks exactly like Nora. Now she apparently wants to steal Nora's body... even though her own body seems to be working fine.Director/writer Michael Almereyda seems to have only a vague idea of how proper storytelling works. Important characters appear without introduction two-thirds of the way through, logic is constantly violated (so Niamh doesn't realize that a cigarette is ON FIRE, but she knows what whiskey is?), and the awkward climax ends up pretty much making no sense at all.Worst of all: huge oozing lumps of exposition are constantly thrown at us like lumps of excrement... from people who couldn't POSSIBLY know what they are talking about. How does Bill know the history of Niamh? Magic, apparently. How does Alice know all about her powers and intentions? Never explained. It becomes infuriating after awhile, especially when you realize that Alice is JUST there to exposit.Almereyda tries to compensate by draping the movie in a dreamy atmosphere and Ireland's peaty, raw beauty... but it's not enough. The movie sludges by at a painfully slow pace, with lots of people wandering around and having the world's slowest conversations, most of which are pretentious muckity-mystical drivel (&#34;Every day; all the time. You wake up, open your eyes, take a breath, start over: that's how it is&#34;).  And of course, Alice monologues over everything. EVERYTHING.And rarely do you see a movie that is so padded, yet STILL manages to drag by at a snail's pace. For instance, several characters fall down the stairs. There's apparently no symbolic meaning to it -- they just fall down the stairs because it eats up a few minutes of screen time and looks dramatic.It also has a cast where you root for nobody, because nobody is likable. Christopher Walken comes the closest merely by being himself -- weird, off-kilter, and utterly unconvincing as a lifelong resident of Ireland. But he sadly exits the movie after only a few scenes, and we're left with... everyone else.I kept waiting for a moment to come when we start to like and empathize with the lead characters -- a pair of rich, irresponsible alcoholics -- only to eventually realize that Almereyda intended for us to like them already. Elliott and Harris are mediocre and charmless here, especially since Elliott has to play the dual role of Nora and Niamh, which she does with slack-jawed dullness worthy of Kristen Stewart.And the character of Alice is the most naked, blatant &#34;exposition fairy&#34; that I have ever seen in a film. I kept thinking that she was the love child that Nora claimed to have aborted, but it turns out that she is nobody special. Just a source of pseudo-mystical narration... and nothing else.Watching &#34;The Eternal: Kiss of the Mummy&#34; is like being slowly dragged facedown through Ireland's mud -- it will leave you cold and miserable. And eventually, you'll want a Guinness to dull the pain.",1,Squandered potential,1393891200,"03 4, 2014",2014,4070,"['mummy', 'movie', 'possibly', 'easiest', 'kind', 'horror', 'movie', 'make', 'life', 'living', 'Simple', 'effective.And', 'yet', '34', 'Eternal', 'Kiss', 'Mummy', '34', '34', 'Trance', '34', 'managed', 'screw', 'simple', 'formula', 'up', 'ever-interesting', 'presence', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'pretty', 'cinematography', 'story', 'flaccid', 'flabby', 'mess', 'plot', 'holes', 'basic', 'writing', 'errors', 'including', 'least', 'sympathetic', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie.Nora', 'Alison', 'Elliott', 'Jim', 'Jared', 'Harris', 'are', 'pair', 'wealthy', 'alcoholics', 'New', 'York', 'who', 'have', 'decided', 'dry', 'out', 'visit', 'grandmother', 'Ireland', 'Yes', 'plan', 'dry', 'out', 'land', 'Guinness', 'apparently', ""n't"", 'count', 'booze', 'when', 'arrive', 'Nora', 'immediately', 'out', 'car.And', 'getting', 'better', 'grandmother', 'highly', 'selected', 'senility', 'only', 'see', 'movies', 'weird', 'uncle', 'Bill', 'Walken', 'only', 'interested', 'bog-preserved', 'mummy', 'druid', 'witch', 'who', 'murder-suicided', 'Iron', 'Age', 'course', 'mummy', 'back', 'life', 'reason', 'ever', 'explained', 'exactly', 'like', 'Nora', 'Now', 'apparently', 'steal', 'Nora', 'body', 'even', 'own', 'body', 'be', 'working', 'fine.Director/writer', 'Michael', 'Almereyda', 'have', 'only', 'vague', 'idea', 'how', 'proper', 'storytelling', 'works', 'Important', 'characters', 'appear', 'introduction', 'two-thirds', 'way', 'constantly', 'violated', 'so', 'Niamh', ""n't"", 'realize', 'cigarette', 'ON', 'FIRE', 'what', 'whiskey', 'awkward', 'climax', 'up', 'pretty', 'much', 'making', 'sense', 'all.Worst', 'huge', 'oozing', 'lumps', 'exposition', 'are', 'constantly', 'thrown', 'lumps', 'excrement', 'people', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'POSSIBLY', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'talking', 'How', 'Bill', 'know', 'history', 'Niamh', 'Magic', 'apparently', 'How', 'Alice', 'know', 'powers', 'intentions', 'Never', 'explained', 'infuriating', 'awhile', 'especially', 'when', 'realize', 'Alice', 'JUST', 'there', 'exposit.Almereyda', 'tries', 'compensate', 'draping', 'movie', 'dreamy', 'atmosphere', 'Ireland', 'peaty', 'raw', 'beauty', 'not', 'enough', 'movie', 'sludges', 'painfully', 'slow', 'pace', 'lots', 'people', 'wandering', 'around', 'having', 'world', 'slowest', 'conversations', 'most', 'are', 'pretentious', 'muckity-mystical', 'drivel', '34', 'Every', 'day', 'time', 'wake', 'up', 'open', 'eyes', 'take', 'breath', 'start', 'how', '34', 'course', 'Alice', 'everything', 'EVERYTHING.And', 'rarely', 'do', 'see', 'movie', 'so', 'padded', 'yet', 'STILL', 'drag', 'snail', 'pace', 'instance', 'several', 'characters', 'fall', 'down', 'stairs', 'apparently', 'symbolic', 'meaning', 'just', 'fall', 'down', 'stairs', 'up', 'few', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'dramatic.It', 'also', 'cast', 'where', 'root', 'nobody', 'nobody', 'likable', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'closest', 'merely', 'being', 'weird', 'off-kilter', 'utterly', 'unconvincing', 'lifelong', 'resident', 'Ireland', 'sadly', 'movie', 'only', 'few', 'scenes', ""'re"", 'left', 'everyone', 'else.I', 'kept', 'waiting', 'moment', 'come', 'when', 'start', 'like', 'empathize', 'lead', 'characters', 'pair', 'rich', 'irresponsible', 'alcoholics', 'only', 'eventually', 'realize', 'Almereyda', 'intended', 'like', 'already', 'Elliott', 'Harris', 'are', 'mediocre', 'charmless', 'here', 'especially', 'Elliott', 'play', 'dual', 'role', 'Nora', 'Niamh', 'slack-jawed', 'dullness', 'worthy', 'Kristen', 'Stewart.And', 'character', 'Alice', 'most', 'naked', 'blatant', '34', 'exposition', 'fairy', '34', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'kept', 'thinking', 'was', 'love', 'child', 'Nora', 'claimed', 'have', 'aborted', 'out', 'nobody', 'special', 'Just', 'source', 'pseudo-mystical', 'narration', 'nothing', 'else.Watching', '34', 'Eternal', 'Kiss', 'Mummy', '34', 'being', 'slowly', 'dragged', 'facedown', 'Ireland', 'mud', 'will', 'leave', 'cold', 'miserable', 'eventually', ""'ll"", 'want', 'Guinness', 'dull', 'pain']",N/A

505127,AHJ5MWFXGGQ3T,B00000IXC2,Mathias,"[1, 1]","I really wish that Michael Almereyda had kept the alternate title for this movie, which was Trance. The Eternal: Kiss of the Mummy is a terrible title, and the cover graphics make it look like any other lame horror flick. But it's not.The Eternal is traditional mummy/haunted house/zombie movie, but with interesting details. A woman who emigrated from Ireland at the age of 16 returns to her native country with her Irish-American husband (I think; Jared Harris looks like a short version of Conan O'Brien here) and their son. She and her husband are alcoholics and want to start over by reuniting with her grandmother and uncle. You can tell that they love their son, but they neglect him by drinking. It's not a typical mummy movie set-up, and it makes you see the characters as people and not just victims.It returns to conventions with the addition of her invalid grandmother, her crazy uncle, and the mysterious little girl he adopted. But even these have twists. The mummy is a Druid corpse and not an Egyptian one. Christopher Walken makes the uncle simultaneously hilarious and terrifying. And the little girl is the most sane one in the house. With the exception of the grandmother, who seemed one-dimensional, the characters are well-played. There are slight touches of other films in it: Psycho, Days of Wine and Roses, What Lies Beneath, even Straw Dogs.Michael Almereyda's Hamlet is one of my favorite movies, but since The Eternal obviously does not have Shakespeare's writing, it exposes Almereyda's weakness in plot development. Once the scariness sets in, the story becomes so loosely constructed that it's hard to determine what's actually happening. And that's how the film dies, so to speak.Overall, it's a good movie but not a great one.",3,Great potential that is never fully realized...,1163116800,"11 10, 2006",2006,1759,"['really', 'wish', 'Michael', 'Almereyda', 'had', 'kept', 'alternate', 'title', 'movie', 'was', 'Trance', 'Eternal', 'Kiss', 'Mummy', 'terrible', 'title', 'cover', 'graphics', 'make', 'look', 'other', 'lame', 'horror', 'flick', 'not.The', 'Eternal', 'traditional', 'mummy/haunted', 'house/zombie', 'movie', 'interesting', 'details', 'woman', 'who', 'emigrated', 'Ireland', 'age', '16', 'returns', 'native', 'country', 'Irish-American', 'husband', 'think', 'Jared', 'Harris', 'short', 'version', 'Conan', ""O'Brien"", 'here', 'son', 'husband', 'are', 'alcoholics', 'want', 'start', 'over', 'reuniting', 'grandmother', 'uncle', 'can', 'tell', 'love', 'son', 'neglect', 'drinking', 'not', 'typical', 'mummy', 'movie', 'set-up', 'see', 'characters', 'people', 'not', 'just', 'victims.It', 'returns', 'conventions', 'addition', 'invalid', 'grandmother', 'crazy', 'uncle', 'mysterious', 'little', 'girl', 'adopted', 'even', 'have', 'twists', 'mummy', 'Druid', 'corpse', 'not', 'Egyptian', 'one', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'uncle', 'simultaneously', 'hilarious', 'terrifying', 'little', 'girl', 'most', 'sane', 'one', 'house', 'exception', 'grandmother', 'who', 'seemed', 'one-dimensional', 'characters', 'are', 'well-played', 'are', 'slight', 'touches', 'other', 'films', 'Psycho', 'Days', 'Wine', 'Roses', 'What', 'Beneath', 'even', 'Straw', 'Dogs.Michael', 'Almereyda', 'Hamlet', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'Eternal', 'obviously', 'not', 'have', 'Shakespeare', 'writing', 'Almereyda', 'weakness', 'plot', 'development', 'scariness', 'sets', 'story', 'so', 'loosely', 'constructed', 'hard', 'determine', 'what', 'actually', 'happening', 'how', 'film', 'dies', 'so', 'speak.Overall', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'one']",N/A

Pretty much what you'd expect from Walken, thought I sort of knew he would die. He looked more like a pale vampireish figure (with one blind eye). Maybe it was the red robed coat that gave it away. The mummy is in the shape of Elliott and it's on the loose when it gets done chopping poor Walken to bits. It goes on, roaming threw the house. Tensions flare and chills fly.

They discover that their weird uncle (Christopher Walken) has a 2000 year-old mummy of a Druid witch in the basement, which he's trying to revive!This is a Gothic tale told in the modern day and struck me as a Hammer film if it were released today, albeit it lacks the typical Hammer women. Yet, it does have Alison Elliott in the starring role of the alcoholic wife and -- although she's not in the league of the typical Hammer female -- she's alluring enough and a great actress to boot. At first, she'll strike you as the girl-next-door type -- a sort-of plain Jane -- but there's something about her face, her expressions and aura that increasingly pique your interest.""THE ETERNAL Kiss of the Mummy"" is not your typical modern-day horror schlock. It doesn't shoot for conventional horror and gore, but it IS pretty creepy in a Gothic sense. I saw ""Big Bad Wolf"" before I viewed this one and, although ""Big Bad Wolf"" is thrilling and ultra gory, it's not scary, mainly because the filmmakers & cast cop a semi-campy vibe. ""THE ETERNAL"", by contrast, plays it completely straight and the foggy Irish moors & centuries-old mansion add to the ghostly ambiance.There's also a quality soundtrack with a few stand-out alternative rock numbers, like the one that plays during the end credits, ""My Head Becomes the Sky"" by Tara Baoth Mooney.Like I said, the film struck me as a Hammer film if it were made today. As such, there's a Gothic beauty to it, which makes it a pleasure just to watch even if the story is ""sluggish"", as some criticize. It's clear that director/writer Michael Almereyda was aiming for art more than common horror thrills. I'd compare it to ""The Mothman Prophecies"" in this sense, albeit not as good.After viewing, I reflected on the seemingly nonsensical story and certain things started to make sense: This is only a story about a Druid witch coming back to life on the surface; it's really about a woman in bondage to alcoholism who comes face-to-face with her lower nature -- her self-destructive side (her ""id"" or ""flesh"") -- not to mention confronting her incestuous uncle -- and trying to prevail. Going back to her home town -- her heritage, her roots -- enables her to see WHY she turned to alcohol for succor in the first place.In essence, this is a Gothic tale about the purging of one's fleshly demons.The film runs 95 minutes.GRADE: B",4,"Haunting, creepy, beautiful, artsy, deep...",1384819200,"11 19, 2013",2013,2660,"['are', 'words', 'came', 'mind', 'watching', '1998', 'THE', 'ETERNAL', 'Kiss', 'Mummy', 'originally', 'titled', 'Trance', 'story', 'alcoholic', 'couple', 'who', 'travel', 'wife', 'home', 'town', 'Ireland', 'supposedly', 'sober', 'up', 'give', 'son', 'opportunity', 'meet', 'grandmother', 'discover', 'weird', 'uncle', 'Christopher', 'Walken', '2000', 'year-old', 'mummy', 'Druid', 'witch', 'basement', 'trying', 'revive', 'Gothic', 'tale', 'told', 'modern', 'day', 'struck', 'Hammer', 'film', 'were', 'released', 'today', 'typical', 'Hammer', 'women', 'have', 'Alison', 'Elliott', 'starring', 'role', 'alcoholic', 'wife', 'not', 'league', 'typical', 'Hammer', 'female', 'alluring', 'enough', 'great', 'actress', 'boot', 'first', ""'ll"", 'strike', 'girl-next-door', 'type', 'sort-of', 'plain', 'Jane', 'something', 'face', 'expressions', 'aura', 'increasingly', 'pique', 'interest', 'ETERNAL', 'Kiss', 'Mummy', 'not', 'typical', 'modern-day', 'horror', 'schlock', ""n't"", 'shoot', 'conventional', 'horror', 'gore', 'pretty', 'creepy', 'Gothic', 'sense', 'saw', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Wolf', 'viewed', 'one', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Wolf', 'thrilling', 'ultra', 'gory', 'not', 'scary', 'mainly', 'filmmakers', 'cast', 'cop', 'semi-campy', 'vibe', 'ETERNAL', 'contrast', 'completely', 'straight', 'foggy', 'Irish', 'moors', 'centuries-old', 'mansion', 'add', 'ghostly', 'also', 'quality', 'soundtrack', 'few', 'stand-out', 'alternative', 'rock', 'numbers', 'one', 'end', 'Head', 'Becomes', 'Sky', 'Tara', 'Baoth', 'Mooney.Like', 'said', 'film', 'struck', 'Hammer', 'film', 'were', 'made', 'today', 'such', 'Gothic', 'beauty', 'pleasure', 'just', 'watch', 'even', 'story', 'sluggish', 'criticize', 'clear', 'director/writer', 'Michael', 'Almereyda', 'was', 'aiming', 'art', 'more', 'common', 'horror', 'thrills', ""'d"", 'compare', 'Mothman', 'Prophecies', 'sense', 'albeit', 'not', 'good.After', 'viewing', 'reflected', 'seemingly', 'nonsensical', 'story', 'certain', 'things', 'started', 'make', 'sense', 'only', 'story', 'Druid', 'witch', 'coming', 'back', 'life', 'surface', 'really', 'woman', 'bondage', 'alcoholism', 'who', 'face-to-face', 'lower', 'nature', 'self-destructive', 'side', 'id', 'flesh', 'not', 'mention', 'confronting', 'incestuous', 'uncle', 'trying', 'prevail', 'Going', 'back', 'home', 'town', 'heritage', 'roots', 'see', 'WHY', 'turned', 'alcohol', 'succor', 'first', 'place.In', 'essence', 'Gothic', 'tale', 'purging', 'one', 'fleshly', 'demons.The', 'film', '95', 'minutes.GRADE', 'B']",N/A
