Have all the old time ELO fans simply become stoic and settled in their suburban hells?This is ridiculous. A fifth grader could have successfully pulled off the marketing coup of actually playing snippets of the classics in the ad!?! How about internet ads that focused on the greatness of ELO and the rarity of seeing them live!?! Why not have them play smaller venues?While this production is magnificent and highly entertaining it was only actually &quot;live&quot; for a lucky few. It really begs the question of &quot;How healthy can all that squabbling among band members really be for any of them?&quot; The other guys are playing county fairs, for godssake.

I just read press releases talking about the upcoming audio CD release of this show which would include the MISSING songs. I hadn't known I wasn't watching a complete show. Not releasing complete shows on a concert DVD is one of my pet-peeves--so minus one star for that.I was an ELO fan back when there actually was an &quot;Orchestra&quot; part to them, but lost interest when that sound was faded out. I can still remember the excitement of hearing 10538 Overture for the first time playing from a free promo &quot;45 rpm&quot; I had picked out of a give-away bin at my local discount store because I thought the bands name sounded cool. I had no idea what I was getting then, but I've loved that sound and that song ever since I heard it. The other complaints I have with this DVD are the cellos are not nearly loud enough in the mix which takes away some of the punch they should be adding. And, the violin is missing totally. Otherwise, this is a pretty flawless disc. It sounds like a studio recording, I haven't followed if there were overdubs on this or not. If not, then you are seeing amazing performances. You are also seeing, to me, amazing classy eye-candy throughout--since Rosie stands so close to Jeff. I am glad they included some of those great old songs like 10538 and Ma-Ma-Ma Belle and Beethoven into the show, because they're the highlights.Some of the post &quot;orchestra sound&quot; songs I never really liked on record because they were too wimpy have a little more edge to them in this live setting too.

674513,A21LXRA241XM4A,B00005QBZC,"David R. Hardin ""Zoned in space""","[10, 13]","Where do I start? I've been an avid fan of Electric Light Orchestra since their 2nd album back in 1973(ELO II), and this is NOT the Electric Light Orchestra. It's Jeff Lynne and original Electric Light Orchestra member Richard Tandy, with a group of unknowns, in an impromptu performance of some of the best songs by the Electric Light Orchestra.I don't mean to trash or demean the talents of everyone else on the stage in this performance, partly female (and the only reason I mention ""female"" is because the original band had no female members, aside from the occasional backing studio musicians) with awesome, incredible unimaginable talent......but again, it's NOT the Electric Light Orchestra. The absence of Kelly Groucett, Mik Kaminski, Mike Edwards, Hugh McDowell, Melvin Gale and Bev Bevan are incredibly felt as you watch this performance.The best thing to do is to play this without the video and imagine the original Electric Light Orchestra playing this set of old tunes. The ""Zoom"" songs come off great, as do the old hits, as long as you keep your eyes closed during the playback.As you can plainly notice I do not refer to the original band as ""ELO"".....I really think that was a cop-out made by Jeff Lynne (under pressure from his record company at the time) in the early 80's to try to keep the band in the mainstream at the time. But even most of the original members I mentioned above hung around for most of the ""ELO"" years.Jeff Lynne affectionately refers to his entourage as ""ELO"", which to me came across as meaning that anyone that Jeff Lynne decides is a part of his band is ""ELO"". As a follower of the Electric Light Orchestra this is almost an outrage. This incarnation should be called ""Jeff Lynne & Friends""! NOT ELO or The Electric Light Orchestra!Don't get me wrong though. This is an incredible performance by the people Jeff Lynne put together for this performance. The ladies on strings and backing vocals (Peggy Baldwin and Sarah O'Brien on strings, and Rosie Vela on backing vocals) are not only extremely talented but serve as ""eye candy"" during the presentation, which is an incredible disservice to these talented and gifted artists! That may have been Lynne's strategy with the ""Zoom"" tour. He might have figured that if fans of Electric Light Orchestra wouldn't settle for the dramatic changes in the personnel of the original ensemble, they could at least be appeased by the female ""scenery""! These ladies deserve much much more credit than that. (In this light, I can't say anything bad about Lynne's recognition of TRUE talent!)Again, an excellent performance by everyone on stage......but it's NOT The Electric Light Orchestra OR ELO!It's as if Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr got on stage and called themselves The Beatles! I THINK NOT!!!!I will say though....when ""One Summer Dream"" played I was transported back to 1975. This is probably one of the few times the performance of this song has been recorded live.....and it blew me away! But ""Don't Bring Me Down"" sounds as if a local bar band was performing the song!I highly respect the talents of Jeff Lynne, but I also respect the talents of the original Electric Light Orchestra members. I deeply appreciate the efforts of Lynne to resurrect the ""strange magic"" of the olden days, but without the key members of the original band, this comes off as a ""whatever will work"" effort.For occasional fans of the orginal band this is an excellent trip back to the past, but for die-hard fans of the original Electric Light Orchestra......watch the Wembley concert instead. Even with Wembley's lack of quality due to the age of the recording, it's still a better alternative to Lynne's re-working of the band in this quality performance.",3,"Fantastic performance, but this is not the Electric Light Orchestra",1171065600,"02 10, 2007",2007,3730,"['Where', 'do', 'start', ""'ve"", 'been', 'avid', 'fan', 'Electric', 'Light', 'Orchestra', '2nd', 'album', 'back', '1973', 'ELO', 'II', 'NOT', 'Electric', 'Light', 'Orchestra', 'Jeff', 'Lynne', 'original', 'Electric', 'Light', 'Orchestra', 'member', 'Richard', 'Tandy', 'group', 'unknowns', 'impromptu', 'performance', 'best', 'songs', 'Electric', 'Light', 'Orchestra.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'trash', 'demean', 'talents', 'everyone', 'else', 'stage', 'performance', 'partly', 'female', 'only', 'reason', 'mention', 'female', 'original', 'band', 'had', 'female', 'members', 'aside', 'occasional', 'backing', 'studio', 'musicians', 'awesome', 'incredible', 'unimaginable', 'talent', 'again', 'NOT', 'Electric', 'Light', 'Orchestra', 'absence', 'Kelly', 'Groucett', 'Mik', 'Kaminski', 'Mike', 'Edwards', 'Hugh', 'McDowell', 'Melvin', 'Gale', 'Bev', 'Bevan', 'are', 'incredibly', 'felt', 'watch', 'performance.The', 'best', 'thing', 'do', 'play', 'video', 'imagine', 'original', 'Electric', 'Light', 'Orchestra', 'playing', 'set', 'old', 'tunes', 'Zoom', 'songs', 'come', 'off', 'great', 'do', 'old', 'hits', 'as', 'long', 'keep', 'eyes', 'closed', 'playback.As', 'can', 'plainly', 'notice', 'do', 'not', 'refer', 'original', 'band', 'ELO', '..I', 'really', 'think', 'was', 'cop-out', 'made', 'Jeff', 'Lynne', 'pressure', 'record', 'company', 'time', 'early', '80', 'try', 'keep', 'band', 'mainstream', 'time', 'even', 'most', 'original', 'members', 'mentioned', 'hung', 'most', 'ELO', 'years.Jeff', 'Lynne', 'affectionately', 'entourage', 'ELO', 'came', 'meaning', 'anyone', 'Jeff', 'Lynne', 'part', 'band', 'ELO', 'follower', 'Electric', 'Light', 'Orchestra', 'almost', 'outrage', 'incarnation', 'should', 'be', 'called', 'Jeff', 'Lynne', 'Friends', 'NOT', 'ELO', 'Electric', 'Light', 'Orchestra', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'though', 'incredible', 'performance', 'people', 'Jeff', 'Lynne', 'put', 'together', 'performance', 'ladies', 'strings', 'backing', 'vocals', 'Peggy', 'Baldwin', 'Sarah', ""O'Brien"", 'strings', 'Rosie', 'Vela', 'backing', 'vocals', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'extremely', 'talented', 'serve', 'eye', 'candy', 'presentation', 'incredible', 'disservice', 'talented', 'gifted', 'artists', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Lynne', 'strategy', 'Zoom', 'tour', 'might', 'have', 'figured', 'fans', 'Electric', 'Light', 'Orchestra', 'would', ""n't"", 'settle', 'dramatic', 'changes', 'personnel', 'original', 'ensemble', 'could', 'least', 'be', 'appeased', 'female', 'scenery', 'ladies', 'deserve', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'credit', 'light', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'bad', 'Lynne', 'recognition', 'TRUE', 'talent', 'Again', 'excellent', 'performance', 'everyone', 'stage', 'NOT', 'Electric', 'Light', 'Orchestra', 'OR', 'ELO', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'Ringo', 'Starr', 'got', 'stage', 'called', 'Beatles', 'THINK', 'NOT', 'will', 'say', '.when', 'One', 'Summer', 'Dream', 'played', 'was', 'transported', 'back', '1975', 'probably', 'one', 'few', 'times', 'performance', 'song', 'been', 'recorded', 'live', '..and', 'blew', 'away', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Bring', 'Me', 'Down', 'local', 'bar', 'band', 'was', 'performing', 'song', 'highly', 'respect', 'talents', 'Jeff', 'Lynne', 'also', 'respect', 'talents', 'original', 'Electric', 'Light', 'Orchestra', 'members', 'deeply', 'appreciate', 'efforts', 'Lynne', 'resurrect', 'strange', 'magic', 'olden', 'days', 'key', 'members', 'original', 'band', 'off', 'will', 'work', 'effort.For', 'occasional', 'fans', 'orginal', 'band', 'excellent', 'trip', 'back', 'past', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'original', 'Electric', 'Light', 'Orchestra', 'watch', 'Wembley', 'concert', 'instead', 'Even', 'Wembley', 'lack', 'quality', 'due', 'age', 'recording', 'still', 'better', 'alternative', 'Lynne', 're-working', 'band', 'quality', 'performance']",N/A

It truly is a shame that they couldn't draw crowds and had to abandon their tour.  It's not Jeff's fault.  No one knew he was back.  I didn't, nor my son, nor several other ELO fans that I've talked to.  If they advertised this concert, the promoters did a poor job of it (this dvd was shot in L.A., and that's my home territory!)On to the concert.  Jeff Lynne doesn't hold much stage presence.  He seemed nervous and self-conscious when speaking to the audience, and it seemed he was hiding behind his 70s hair, beard, and glasses (a Jeff Lynne trademark, I guess).  Be that as it may, his voice was never better.  The performances on his many hits were terrific.  Add to that two talented and attractive cello players (Peggy Baldwin and Sarah O'Brien), a knockout backup singer (Rosie Vela -- and her voice wasn't bad either;), and a keyboard wizard (Richard Tandy), and I'd say Jeff just might have something here.Along with a fine concert, this dvd also has an interview with Lynne.  While the interview was interesting, Lynne didn't come off sounding too bright (good thing it was a short interview).  But don't let this, or his lack of stage presence, keep you from owning this concert.  It's one dvd that every ELO fan must have.  Between 1 and 10, ZOOM gets a solid 8.Update:  Boy, does time fly by.  It's been awhile since I last seen this concert (or sat down and listened to all my ELO music), but one thing I did come away with after spending several hours listening to my Jeff Lynne / ELO collection  is his impressive body of work.

Anson (aka &#34;Mr. IT&#34;),"[4, 4]","OK, now that you've read all the reviews about how ""Zoom"" is somehow compromised because... a) Jeff Lynne did EVERYTHING on the studio album; b) The live band roster did not include any of the old ELO band members except Lynne and Richard Tandy; c) The album, tour, and DVD all flopped consider this:a) After Roy Wood left after the first album, ELO *was* Jeff Lynne.b) Essentially, the various ELO bands have never been more than a cover band for Jeff Lynne's material and production.c) The album, tour, and DVD flopped due to lack of good marketing and promotion NOT a lack of quality.On that last point, history may look back on Zoom as one of the best ELO projects. That's because this band is better musically and stylistically than any of the prior ELO rosters. Gone are string players of questionable musical ability dragging their instruments around the stage and shredding their bows to pieces in maniacal attempts to 'look interesting'. Gone are male tenors straining their vocal chords to sound like sopranos. Gone are boring simple string arrangements trying to masquerade as 'high art'. This live band is tight, entertaining and interesting without being pretentious, bombastic, or downright dull (like the original ELO tended to be).On the 'flop' issue, while a superb composer, producer, and musician Jeff Lynne has never been a very good business man. The marketing and execution of several of the Move and ELO albums was handicapped by this fact - just consider some of the album covers (does anyone remember how the cover of 'Eldorado' was savaged by the critics? I do. And, I'm STILL trying to figure out that belly button cover photo from 'On The Third Day'!) Thankfully for us all, ELO is a case study of how good art occasionally triumphs over bad marketing.

Not too surprisingly ELO (this version anyway) played well enough, but wasn't very exciting to watch. This DVD is basically nearly two hours of watching eight well dressed people standing stiffly in place on a suprisingly small stage before a tiny PBS-like audience without even a basic light show to create any kind of mood to match the nice selection of music. The sound and video were nice and clear, especially for being nearly a dozen years old, it's just that the show was literally boring to watch. If the viewer is partial to opera or ballet, this shouldn't be too much of an issue, but even they may be tested. For anyone expecting any kind of visual entertainment, they will be &#34;brought down&#34; by the band's lack of personality. Maybe I was expecting too much.

I will start this review with a review, and then I'll add some comments/impressions.I knew several of ELO's songs, but I was not an expert on the band.  I did not know, for example, that there was a female vocalist in the band (remember, this was the day of the Bee Gees, and I thought it could have been all men).  I did remember someone (maybe Casey Kasem) say that they had a violinist and a pair of celloists in the band.  In this incarnation, there was no violinist.  I think I could tell its absense on one song, and on ""Roll Over Beethoven"", the keyboards took over for the violins.I enjoy the fact that the songs were a mixture of the old and new.  As I said, I was not an expert of the band, so 13 of the 23 songs were new to me, meaning I did not recognize 7 of the older songs (since 6 were from the album ""Zoom"").  It was not exhaustive of the old hits -- the most notable omission was ""Sweet Talking Woman"" -- but it featured all my favorites, which were ""Strange Magic"", ""Living Thing"", ""Turn To Stone"", ""Mr. Blue Sky"", and ""Can't Get It Out Of My Head"" (which was a song that, after I heard it, I couldn't ""Get It Out Of My Head"").I really enjoyed the concert, but I wanted to make a comment on Jeff Lynne's glasses.  I knew it was something involving just him, since he was the only one who wore glasses.  I can think of four reasons why:1.  He's always wore glasses like that -- it's part of his image.2.  He always wears them for a similar reason that KISS wears makeup -- no one can recognize him in person.3.  Jeff Lynne is blind, though that did not seem likely watching him perform.4.  Those were druggie glasses; with Jeff's mannerisms in concert when he spoke between songs, I would not have been shocked to learn he was high.This project confirms why I always liked ELO.  Besides my favorites, other songs I enjoyed included ""Just For Love"", ""Tightrope"", ""10538 Overture"", and ""Shine A Little Love"".

Not that they were so much better than everyone else - but because, like Queen, for example, they had a style and a sound that really was innovative and all their own.  An acquired taste, perhaps (certainly not for anyone who thinks that Rock and Roll should never feature a string section!), but a taste worth acquiring.What is particularly notable about this performance is the relative faithfulness to the original recordings.  Some groups seem to feel that is a betrayal of their artistic integrity to ever give a live performance that matches their recorded material.  To my mind this is like the film company that buys up a bestselling novel and re-writes it to such an extent that only the names remain the same.I'm not suggesting that pop music should never be innovative, but if things are going to change it should at least be for the better - which is all too often not the case.In the Zoom concert we get 23 numbers, of which 17 are old favourites, and six are from the Orchestra's new album.  At first hearing the older tracks all sound pretty much as they did way back when, but listen a little more carefully and there are SUBTLE variations, especially from keyboardist Richard Tandy, that ensure that they have renewed vigour and Kerpow!ELO were great then, they're great Now.

Also there is &quot;mock&quot; violin sounds from the keyboards (BTW, which is played by the only other former ELO member Richard Tandy).Secondly, on the album Zoom, most of it is played by Jeff Lynne himself with guests George Harrsion, Ringo Starr, a celloist, and Richard Tandy -- I'm probably missing others...but I don't think that consitutes calling it Electric Light Orchestra.I have the suspicion that maybe it's because it may be a bigger draw that having just the Jeff Lynne name on a product.  Or is it the influence of ELO contained within that makes it qualify as ELO.I would have prefered it being just the Jeff Lynne Project or something to that degree because of the above explanations.Either way you slice it though, it's still a great DVD - ELO or Jeff Lynne.  The sound is superb on surround sound.A+",5,Jeff Lynne Does ELO on Zoom Tour Live DVD,1021680000,"05 18, 2002",2002,1493,"['excellent', 'DVD', 'Jeff', 'Lynne', 'quot', 'covering', 'quot', 'alot', 'older', 'ELO', 'material', 'new', 'material', 'new', 'album', 'excuse', 'THEIR', 'NEW', 'ALBUM', 'ZOOM', 'material', 'very', 'good', 'agree', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'Lynne', 'stage', 'presence', 'not', 'invigorating', 'entertaining', 'music', 'punch', 'music', 'played', 'very', 'well.The', 'only', 'thing', 'whole', 'Zoom', 'idea/concept', 'really', 'Jeff', 'Lynne', 'solo', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'when', ""'m"", 'watching', 'this.First', 'off', 'are', 'quot', 'real', 'strings', 'quot', '2', 'celloists', 'are', 'barely', 'audible', 'ears', 'only', 'enhance', 'bass', 'anything', 'Also', 'quot', 'quot', 'keyboards', 'BTW', 'played', 'only', 'other', 'former', 'ELO', 'member', 'Richard', 'Tandy', '.Secondly', 'album', 'Zoom', 'most', 'played', 'Jeff', 'Lynne', 'guests', 'George', 'Harrsion', 'Ringo', 'Starr', 'celloist', 'Richard', 'Tandy', ""'m"", 'probably', 'missing', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'calling', 'Electric', 'Light', 'Orchestra.I', 'have', 'suspicion', 'may', 'be', 'bigger', 'draw', 'having', 'just', 'Jeff', 'Lynne', 'name', 'product', 'influence', 'ELO', 'contained', 'qualify', 'ELO.I', 'would', 'have', 'prefered', 'being', 'just', 'Jeff', 'Lynne', 'Project', 'something', 'degree', 'way', 'slice', 'still', 'great', 'DVD', 'ELO', 'Jeff', 'Lynne', 'sound', 'superb', 'surround', 'sound.A+']",N/A

Now, if there is a distinct change of sound for better or worse when I am playing live, or if I decide to re-record because of personnel changes I make, then that's either my good fortune OR my fault. In the case of Jeff Lynne, its the same thing. It is Jeff that is taking the chance. The guy loves to write songs and perform. It's his life. Why should he retire or call it quits just because former band mates are no longer around or are no longer interested in performing? Why did the ""Zoom"" Tour fail? Who knows!

The planned 2001 tour was cancelled unfortunately, but this DVD was released despite the cancellation. It's sad that fans had to deal with a consolation prize, but this DVD is about the best consolation possible.I am firmly of the belief that Jeff Lynne IS ELO. Apart from the first ELO album which was a collaboration between Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne, the rest of ELO's catalog is almost completely written, produced, and sung by Lynne. Anybody who tries to complain that this 2001 version of ELO is somehow not authentic enough is ignoring the fact that Lynne endured numerous personell changes over the years, precisely because ELO was basically his own project which could have just as easily been released under the name ""Jeff Lynne.""The rather mediocre faux-ELO lineup that toured and recorded a few albums in the 90's as ""ELO Part II"" without Lynne is a testament to how important Lynne's songwriting, production, and vocals were and are. Note the prominent placement of Lynne's name on the cover of this DVD to alert potential consumers that this DVD is not one of the cheap ""ELO Part II"" productions.This show mixes tracks from the 2001 ""Zoom"" album (which doesn't feature this live band; the ""Zoom"" album is pretty much Lynne solo with some guest spots from others) with plenty of ELO hits and a few relatively obscure gems (i.e. ""One Summer Dream""). Lynne put together a band here that performs the all of the numbers impeccably. Lynne's voice is in top shape, which is an increasing rarity among so-called ""aging classic rock"" acts.The DVD presentation is top-notch as well, with a great picture shot in high-definition, an excellent 5.1 mix (available in DTS and Dolby Digital) as well as a short interview with Lynne and a few interviews with fans waiting to get into the show.This is about as perfect as a DVD can get.

Unbelievable, lighting, special effects, along with a tight, sober band playing at the top of their game, made for an experience you never forgot.NOBODY, and I mean NOBODY could hold a candle to Electric Light Orchestra. The stage show wasn't a prop, but an intergral part of the experience. Nowdays, if you get a band with a strobe and black curtains everyone goes nuts. Record labels say the cost is just too high to put on a show like that anymore. That's why you need this DVD.The sound is awesome, the camera work is tight, and so is the band. The 24 song set includes all your favorites, and some new material as well. I'm jumping up and down in my living room, and the neighbors think I'm nuts.Jeff Lynne has only one peer in pop music, and his name is Paul McCartney. This is a great showcase for a great time, and if you even remotely ever liked one ELO song, you'll kick yourself for not owning this.If you saw the ELO show, and especially if you didn't, you need this video.",5,Back In The Day,1139184000,"02 6, 2006",2006,1136,"['Back', 'day', 'late', '70', 'early', '80', 'were', 'lucky', 'when', 'went', 'concert', 'got', 'see', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'musical', 'performance', 'SHOW', 'Unbelievable', 'lighting', 'special', 'effects', 'tight', 'sober', 'band', 'playing', 'top', 'game', 'made', 'experience', 'never', 'forgot.NOBODY', 'mean', 'NOBODY', 'could', 'hold', 'candle', 'Electric', 'Light', 'Orchestra', 'stage', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'prop', 'intergral', 'part', 'experience', 'Nowdays', 'get', 'band', 'strobe', 'black', 'curtains', 'everyone', 'nuts', 'Record', 'labels', 'say', 'cost', 'just', 'too', 'high', 'put', 'show', 'anymore', 'why', 'need', 'DVD.The', 'sound', 'awesome', 'camera', 'work', 'tight', 'so', 'band', '24', 'song', 'set', 'favorites', 'new', 'material', 'as', 'well', ""'m"", 'jumping', 'up', 'down', 'living', 'room', 'neighbors', 'think', ""'m"", 'nuts.Jeff', 'Lynne', 'only', 'one', 'peer', 'pop', 'music', 'name', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'great', 'showcase', 'great', 'time', 'even', 'remotely', 'ever', 'liked', 'one', 'ELO', 'song', ""'ll"", 'kick', 'not', 'owning', 'saw', 'ELO', 'show', 'especially', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'video']",N/A

I saw it the other day for a reduced price and picked it up.  I then read a key review.  This reviewer was very hesitant to watch it because the DVD was based on the ill-fated ""Zoom"" tour and did not feature the true ELO band (except for Jeff Lynne and the keyboardist).  I began to think ""wish I had read this review before buying"".  However, as his review continued, I was pleased to read that he enjoyed the DVD once he started watching it, in fact he loved it!  When I got home, I quickly put it on.  I eagerly awaited to hear the DTS sound, and see the Widescreen footage.  Guess what - this DVD is fantastic!  Jeff Lynne sounds fantastic and the female back-up singer is not a disappointment (even if she wasn't part of the original ELO).  On top of that, there are two very talented celloists at the side, and the rest of the band are fantastic too.  The DTS sound is incredible, it certainly gives the Eagles ""Hell Freezes Over"" DVD some competition.  It's a pity the ELO ""Zoom"" tour failed before it got off the ground, because it richly deserved a chance, based on this excellent DVD.  I cannot recommend this DVD enough to ELO fans.  But first, please do yourself a favour and get DTS equipment if you don't already - it's the only way to truly experience it. Long live DTS!

This is the most important part to me about a music dvd. 5 stars.Picture: Again, perfect. The backgrounds are a revolving assortment of colors, and set design is everything you'd expect from the master of the futuristic vibe. And all this comes out with a perfect mastering job... (this and very nice camera work) 5 starsSong selection: Ok, here we go. I struggled with this but in the end my personnel bias won out... (or lost out) I never got into the real old ELO stuff and the performances contained within really never made me want to run out and buy any old ELO tunes. It's a bit top-heavy on the old stuff for my tastes. Contained within the extras a &quot;fan&quot; has a brief interview before the show and he reveals that he is very much looking forward to the show... and his (like mine) fave ELO works is a little number called &quot;Time&quot;. Sadly, these works aren't even brushed upon, and by the SPLENDID sounds of &quot;Shine A Little Love&quot; and &quot;Don't Bring Me Down&quot; it pains me think of how wonderful (and fitting) tunes like &quot;Twilight&quot; and &quot;2095&quot; would have went over... needless to say, I can't get it out of my head. 4 stars.Extras: Well, there is an interview on this that is interesting... all 9.5 minutes of it. Sammy Hagars newest dvd has a seprate disc of an hour interview. Since Jeff Lynne has been out of the ELO spotlight for 15 years I would have expected a bit more thorough of an interview. 3 starsAfter it's all said and done I am VERY pleased with this effort.
