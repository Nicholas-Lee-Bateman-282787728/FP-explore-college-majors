""Good Times"" pretty much follows the formula of the TV program with comedy sketches bookending musical numbers.  The sketches here are mildly amusing but not particularly memorable.  The songs, composed and arranged by Sonny, are terrific.  They have kind of a Spectorish feel to them.  Cher wears outrageous outfits that are more Austin Powers than Bob Mackie.  I think the selling point of the movie is its positive vibes.  Sonny and Cher were married at the time and their love for each other is apparent.

This movie is classic Sonny and Cher comedy, only with a slightly larger budget than the TV show. There is nothing too outstanding about this movie, but it is a must for any Sonny and Cher fans, or if you are just looking for a movie you can sit back, relax, and watch without having to pay too much attention to it.

And it has Sonny and Cher in it.You can sure tell this is a 1960s movie. The clothes look as if they were all made by demented monkeys working with remaindered material. Some of the cinematic effects are bizarre. The plot, such as it is, involves a kind of unholy pact to get a movie done. I can only assume Sonny and Cher signed on the dotted line.It's not to say that there isn't some funny scenes. The commentary on the film industry is biting. The fantasy pieces were OK. Amazingly, the music isn't that good, which is bizarre as you would think this movie would have been written to highlight Sonny and Cher's talents.The thing is, this is so campy that it's hard not to like it.",3,Groovy,1265414400,"02 6, 2010",2010,744,"['OK', 'movie', 'Sonny', 'Cher', 'making', 'movie', 'Sonny', 'Cher', 'it.You', 'can', 'sure', 'tell', '1960s', 'movie', 'clothes', 'look', 'were', 'made', 'demented', 'monkeys', 'working', 'remaindered', 'material', 'cinematic', 'effects', 'are', 'bizarre', 'plot', 'such', 'kind', 'unholy', 'pact', 'get', 'movie', 'done', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'Sonny', 'Cher', 'signed', 'dotted', 'line.It', 'not', 'say', ""n't"", 'funny', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'film', 'industry', 'biting', 'fantasy', 'pieces', 'were', 'OK.', 'Amazingly', 'music', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'bizarre', 'would', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'highlight', 'Sonny', 'Cher', 'talents.The', 'thing', 'so', 'campy', 'hard', 'not', 'like']",N/A

476704,A29YKT85YFAY87,6305757747,L. Allen,"[0, 11]","I bought this for my wife who was a big fan of the TV show, and we watched it together with our 5-yr. old, expecting an evening of '60s silliness and perhaps a few good songs. By the time we were half-way into the movie, our daughter couldn't handle the excessive, gratuitous violence, and neither my wife or I could figure out how William Friedkin (director of The French Connection, The Exorcist, and other immensely successful films) could have directed this atrocity. The script is terrible, and Sonny and Cher appear to be sleep-walking their way through it. They obviously knew something about comedic timing, as their hugely successful show demonstrated, so how could this movie have turned out so bad, with acting so flat? The story itself, the making of a film within the film, may hold the clue: Cher did not really want to make this movie, so it is thus Sonny Bono's vanity project. In the plot line, Sonny demands that if a S&C; movie is made, he have total artistic control; if this is in fact true of this abominable film, then it was a gigantic mistake. Sonny Bono was a businessman in hippie clothes, as his true identity emerged as a conservative Republican congressman in the 1980s. But he was absolutely talentless as a singer, and mediocre at best as a songwriter - proof of the latter is that Cher's best work came after the break-up of the duo. The violence in the movie may be more the product of Friedkin's handiwork, as he may have reluctantly agreed to directing this mess, but it is inexplicable and pointless all the same. There is definitely a streak of  mean-spiritedness that runs through the script, and isn't helped by Sonny's somnabulent delivery and Cher's abject boredom throughout. Veteran actor George Sanders is the only one able to acquit himself in the movie somewhat, but just barely, by playing to type as a heavy.As is obvious from all the positive Amazon reviews of ""Good Times"", diehard Sonny and Cher buffs may like this piece of violent silliness for its nostalgic content, but for the initiate who wants to understand what all the fuss was about, stick to the television show compilations. At least they are better scripted, by far.",1,Violent and silly - for diehard S&C fans ONLY!,1232323200,"01 19, 2009",2009,2181,"['bought', 'wife', 'who', 'was', 'big', 'fan', 'TV', 'show', 'watched', 'together', '5-yr.', 'old', 'expecting', 'evening', ""'60s"", 'silliness', 'perhaps', 'few', 'good', 'songs', 'time', 'were', 'half-way', 'movie', 'daughter', 'could', ""n't"", 'handle', 'excessive', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'wife', 'could', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'director', 'French', 'Connection', 'Exorcist', 'other', 'immensely', 'successful', 'films', 'could', 'have', 'directed', 'atrocity', 'script', 'terrible', 'Sonny', 'Cher', 'appear', 'be', 'sleep-walking', 'way', 'obviously', 'knew', 'something', 'comedic', 'timing', 'hugely', 'successful', 'show', 'demonstrated', 'how', 'could', 'movie', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'so', 'bad', 'acting', 'so', 'flat', 'story', 'making', 'film', 'film', 'may', 'hold', 'clue', 'Cher', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'want', 'make', 'movie', 'thus', 'Sonny', 'Bono', 'vanity', 'project', 'plot', 'line', 'Sonny', 'S', 'C', 'movie', 'made', 'have', 'total', 'artistic', 'control', 'fact', 'true', 'abominable', 'film', 'then', 'was', 'gigantic', 'mistake', 'Sonny', 'Bono', 'was', 'businessman', 'hippie', 'clothes', 'true', 'identity', 'emerged', 'conservative', 'Republican', 'congressman', '1980s', 'was', 'absolutely', 'talentless', 'singer', 'mediocre', 'best', 'songwriter', 'proof', 'latter', 'Cher', 'best', 'work', 'came', 'break-up', 'duo', 'violence', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'product', 'Friedkin', 'handiwork', 'may', 'have', 'reluctantly', 'agreed', 'directing', 'mess', 'inexplicable', 'pointless', 'same', 'definitely', 'streak', 'mean-spiritedness', 'script', ""n't"", 'helped', 'Sonny', 'somnabulent', 'delivery', 'Cher', 'abject', 'boredom', 'Veteran', 'actor', 'George', 'Sanders', 'only', 'one', 'able', 'acquit', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'just', 'barely', 'playing', 'type', 'heavy.As', 'obvious', 'positive', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'Good', 'Times', 'diehard', 'Sonny', 'Cher', 'buffs', 'may', 'like', 'piece', 'violent', 'silliness', 'nostalgic', 'content', 'initiate', 'who', 'understand', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'about', 'stick', 'television', 'show', 'compilations', 'least', 'are', 'better', 'scripted', 'far']",N/A

By '66-'67 Elvis' movies, never quite ""A"" movies, were looking like ""Z"" movies; beach movies were beach movies, some were better than others. The Beatles did well with ""Help!"" but it was no ""Hard Days Night"". Most of those pictures today succeed as enjoyable camp - this one has very little ""dating"".The movie is a bit draggy but consider that all songs are excellent - and even more important, Cher eats up each frame. Stunningly beautiful, somehow her talent for comedy and light drama did not really penetrate at the time - it was still The Guy Who Looks Like Ringo, Writes cool songs, and Has a hot wife.The movie is really a series of sketches and actually is the perfect precursor to their wildly successful TV show of the 1970s. Cher is always one step ahead of her man, wittily keeping him off balance. She has a different wardrobe for almost every scene and looks amazing in each. This was about 7 years before that show!The whole movie really takes place in Sonny's imagination...he agrees to make a movie for mogul George Sanders, is given one week to basically rewrite the trashy script thrown at the team. He plays Jungle Boy, Hip Detective, Gunslinger, etc., in his head....and so we wonder what will wind up on celluloid...within celluloid. Sanders appears in all the [day] dream sequences, as well. Nice touch! He seems to enjoy the occasional lunacy. Character actor Phil Arnold is terrific, as the decidedly uninspired ""suit"" who writes the ""screenplay""; Hank Worden, known as John Wayne's slow-talkin' friend, Ole Mose Harper, in ""The Searchers"", has a very funny scene with Sonny; Mickey Dolenz is in jungle gear, uncredited.I should add that in addition to the film being a true prototype for the TV show...it just might have wrought something called MTV.[Review based upon VHS edition.

It's certainly watchable and a fun period piece.  Sixties fans will get a kick out of seeing scenes of Sonny and Cher going around town and the brief concert footage that is shown at the beginning of the film.The plot concerns Sonny accepting an offer to make a film but Cher doesn't feel it's the right thing to do.  Sonny images them in a Western, a Jungle picture (watch for Micky Dolenz from the Monkees in a quick cameo!), and a detective drama.  The duo find the time to sing a couple of songs, including an accoustic version of &quot;I Got You Babe&quot;.Cher has almost as many wardrobe changes during this film as Natalie Portman does in the Star Wars films.  The director (William Friedkin) seems to have some sort of weird obsession about the scene where Cher is dressed as a (kind of creepy) clown.  It's shown TWICE in flashback form.  It also appears that character actor Paul Frees did a lot of (uncredited) voice overs for this film.  If you like Paul Frees, you'll get to hear a lot of him in this movie.The DVD contains a fairly clean print and it is presented in widesceen format.  The color booklet contains a short plot summary and lists the chapters.  Anchor Bay released this with no extras.  A trailer, bios, and photo gallery would have been a nice plus.  Captions would have been appreciated too.
