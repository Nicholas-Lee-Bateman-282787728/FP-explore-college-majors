Don't get too comfortable though, this is Bollywood and it is bound to get worse before it gets better! Aditya (Sahid Kappor) is at a crisis point in his life, the woman he loves has just married another and he only wants to escape with his own thoughts. Enter Geet (Kareena Kapoor), a chatterbox who is as naive as she is well intentioned. When their paths cross on a train she wants to talk and he wants silence. Persistent, she is determined to get him to open up and when she finds he has left the train she follows him. What follows is a series of misadventures centered around a girl who just can't seem to stay out of trouble and man who feels obliged to look out for her. By the time they finally reach their destination, his annoyance has turned to fondness, but wait, this is Bollywood! She is determined to elope with her love (we've not yet met him) and pulls Aditya into her crazy plot sending them off across the country on another journey. He sees her, he thinks, safely into the arms of her love before returning to his life as a changed man. When he learns that she is missing and no one has heard from her, he sets out to find her and it is now he who is needed to cheer. Of course just when you think they are destined for happily ever after another wrench is thrown into the plot but if you want to know more you will have to watch!",5,Great film; a lot of fun.,1291680000,"12 7, 2010",2010,1427,"['Kareena', 'Kapoor', 'Sahid', 'Kapoor', 'deliver', 'great', 'performances', 'comedy', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'comfortable', 'Bollywood', 'bound', 'get', 'worse', 'better', 'Aditya', 'Sahid', 'Kappor', 'crisis', 'point', 'life', 'woman', 'just', 'married', 'only', 'escape', 'own', 'thoughts', 'Enter', 'Geet', 'Kareena', 'Kapoor', 'chatterbox', 'who', 'as', 'naive', 'well', 'intentioned', 'When', 'paths', 'cross', 'train', 'talk', 'silence', 'Persistent', 'determined', 'get', 'open', 'up', 'when', 'left', 'train', 'What', 'series', 'misadventures', 'centered', 'girl', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'stay', 'trouble', 'man', 'who', 'obliged', 'look', 'out', 'time', 'finally', 'reach', 'destination', 'annoyance', 'turned', 'fondness', 'wait', 'Bollywood', 'determined', 'elope', 'love', ""'ve"", 'not', 'yet', 'met', 'Aditya', 'crazy', 'plot', 'sending', 'off', 'country', 'journey', 'safely', 'arms', 'love', 'returning', 'life', 'changed', 'man', 'When', 'missing', 'one', 'heard', 'out', 'find', 'now', 'who', 'needed', 'cheer', 'course', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'are', 'destined', 'happily', 'ever', 'wrench', 'thrown', 'plot', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'will', 'have', 'watch']",Jab We Met anglais

1129985,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B001165BG0,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[16, 17]","JAB WE MET became one of the biggest hits in Bollywood cinema in 2007, and it's quite easy to see why. This is a very watchable romantic comedy and the two leads, Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor, dazzle in this, their best acting performances yet. After having seen this one just now, andDilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (2DISC SET)recently, I am this close to buying a train ticket to wherever. There've been other cinematic romances on the rails, yeah, but surely they couldn't have been more fun than the time spent on and off the tracks by Aditya and Geet in JAB WE MET.Aditya (Shahid Kapoor) hasn't had a good time of it of late. His father had passed away a year ago, leaving him the reins to his corporate empire. But now business is on the skids. Too, the girl he loves has just gotten married. Despondent beyond belief, Aditya just simply wanders away. He somehow ends up on a train, and this is where he runs into Geet (Kareena Kapoor), who will change his life. Geet is a cute Punjabi girl who just will not stop talking. She exudes this vitality and exuberance which at first grates on Aditya's nerves; he actually implores her to leave him alone. But she keeps talking.So it sucks for Aditya that, when he dispiritedly disembarks from the train, the girl follows him (to tell him the train is leaving) and is herself stranded. Aditya is left with no choice but to do the right thing, which is to escort Geet to her Punjabi home, from where, she cheerfully tells him, she plans to promptly run away and elope with her boyfriend (some guy named Anshuman). Aditya's irritation at Geet gradually turns to affection and then to something more. But, after a travelogue of adventures with her, he finds himself parting ways near Anshuman's doorstep as she goes to meet her lover. And yet the plans of mice and men and Geets don't always pan out. Because, nine months later...JAB WE MET is a marvelous feel good movie, although you can't tell it by the opening scenes, which are depressing (the world falls apart for Aditya) but will intrigue you enough that you'll keep tuned in. Things perk up once Geet makes her appearance, and then get even better as Kareena and Shahid meet and instantly spark up the screen. JAB WE MET is the fourth teaming of these two (afterFida (2004),Chup Chup ke, and36 China Town, with 2008's MILENGE MILENGE being the fifth), and they've obviously managed to perfect that chemistry thing. There might be something to be said for these two having dated for several years in the past in real life (although they've since broken up).In fact, this is the best I've seen of Shahid and of Kareena, whether together or in separate films. It's weird, because Aditya and Geet do end up in some pretty off-the-wall scenarios, but, although you know there are plenty of manipulative moments here, they never feel that contrived. The film unfolds in a graceful, natural way. All credit again to Shahid and Kareena (and, I guess, to the writing and directing). Shahid's Aditya, suffering from heartbreak and from pressures at the job. Kareena's Geet, feisty, carefree, and a constant chatterbox. Both actors put in beautiful, nuanced performances, never quite going over the top, to that point where credibility is lost. Kareena goes away from her vacuous ""beauty princess"" roles, and this is a good thing. Geet is so vibrant for most of the picture that it's a semi-shock to see her metamorphose into a sad, dejected girl in the film's second half. Your heart will go out to her. Kareena, for this role, won for Best Actress in various 2007 Bollywood award shows. She's so engaging in this picture that even her character's mile-a-minute prattle never gets annoying.Meanwhile, Shahid has the tougher role. His part calls for a lack of showboating. Note that he doesn't scream or yell out or overdramatize his anguish to the world. Shahid is so good here, in the little things that he does - whether it's a look or a certain posture or maybe a quiet delivery of a line - that his pain is clearly conveyed. He makes a perfect foil for Kareena's flighty, optimistic character. Like Kareena, he's never been better.JAB WE MET is set against a backdrop of eye-catching landscapes (from Mumbai to Bhatinda to Manali), and, this picturesque flavor enhances the film, trust me. The musical interludes are lively and colorful and catchy (especially the very upbeat ""Mauja Hi Mauja"" and ""Nagada Nagada Nagada Baja""). JAB WE MET is a warmhearted romantic romp. And it's funny. Some of the film's plot complications involve the usual screwball suspects: misunderstandings, mistaken identities, false pretenses... But it's all executed with such charm and good timing. JAB WE MET deserves to be seen, and seen by a lot of people. So, if you haven't yet, do give this one a try. Much as Geet did for Aditya, let Kareena and Shahid put color in your drab world.I am serious about getting that train ticket...",5,"Maybe, sometimes, it's all right to miss your

Deeply depressed Aditya (played by Shahid Kapoor) meets vivacious Geet (Kareena Kapoor) on a train. He finds her annoying at first--and audiences will likely, too--but a series of mishaps brought on by Geet force them to travel together. Geet's infectious joie de vivre eventually inspires Aditya to embrace life with the same enthusiasm and optimism, and he finds himself falling for her, even though her heart belongs to another. When Geet is rejected by the man she wants to marry and her spirit is crushed, Aditya must do for her what she did for him--and he sacrifices his own happiness for hers, the truest measure of love. The two actors, who were romantically involved in real life during the making of the film, are perfect compliments to one another. Their amusing interplay and magnetic attraction are a pleasure to watch, and their misadventures, particularly the ones involving her boisterous family, are quite funny.

This sounded potentially irritating. As it had got good star ratings I decided to try it.For its genre it was actually quite satisfying. The girl only blabbers early on in the movie when the boy and girl meet on a train and it then goes on to look at the effects of the encounter of these two opposite personalities on each other. For him it literally saves his life and turns his life round. She in turn finds more balance and ends up bubbly rather than blubbery.As so many Indian movies this started off with the superficial and then ended up somewhere else with a warmer deeper look into the protagonists.I wasnt familiar with Shahid Kapoor the leading man. He looks like Clark Kent (as played by Dean Cain) and is very watchable. He doesnt dance much which is a pity as his background is in dance and he is very watchable. The girl Kareena Kapoor (no relation) is good too and is doing a natural bubbly.One of those movies that is lightweight but an enjoyable spending of time with some nice people learning about life. While compared to other deeper movies I have seen it may not be 5 stars. I found its music OK but no catchy tune to take away with me. It is lightweight but for its genre it was a pleasant experience and perhaps star ratings are about a genre and to draw others attention to specific buys.,5,I almost passed this by but glad I didnt,1225497600,"11 1, 2008",2008,1424,"['almost', 'let', 'one', 'go', 'description', 'talked', 'girl', 'jabbering', 'having', 'rescue', 'sounded', 'potentially', 'irritating', 'had', 'got', 'good', 'star', 'ratings', 'decided', 'try', 'it.For', 'genre', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'satisfying', 'girl', 'only', 'early', 'movie', 'when', 'boy', 'girl', 'meet', 'train', 'then', 'look', 'effects', 'encounter', 'two', 'opposite', 'personalities', 'other', 'literally', 'life', 'life', 'round', 'turn', 'finds', 'more', 'balance', 'up', 'bubbly', 'rather', 'blubbery.As', 'so', 'many', 'Indian', 'movies', 'started', 'off', 'superficial', 'then', 'ended', 'up', 'somewhere', 'else', 'warmer', 'deeper', 'look', 'protagonists.I', 'wasnt', 'familiar', 'Shahid', 'Kapoor', 'leading', 'man', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'played', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'very', 'watchable', 'doesnt', 'dance', 'much', 'pity', 'background', 'dance', 'very', 'watchable', 'girl', 'Kareena', 'Kapoor', 'relation', 'good', 'too', 'doing', 'natural', 'bubbly.One', 'movies', 'lightweight', 'enjoyable', 'spending', 'time', 'nice', 'people', 'learning', 'life', 'compared', 'other', 'deeper', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'may', 'not', 'be', '5', 'stars', 'found', 'music', 'OK', 'catchy', 'tune', 'take', 'away', 'lightweight', 'genre', 'was', 'pleasant', 'experience', 'perhaps', 'star', 'ratings', 'are', 'genre', 'draw', 'others', 'attention', 'specific', 'buys']",Jab We Met anglais

I was so dissappointed. My expectations were not high at all. The only thing that sticks out in my brain from this movie is Kareena Kapoor's excessive TALKING! She does not keep her mouth shut for the first 30 minutes of the film. Now I'm sure the writer thought he was making a lovable character, which audience's would find her mindless banter appealing and adorable...this was not the case. Instead, her shallow conversations usually between herself could have been filled with a better story line or other cinematic ventures.I would sincerely not recommend this movie to anyone who even wants to see a shallow, expedient romantic comedy. Spend your money and most importantly, TIME on other ones...Kal Ho Naa Ho, Chup Ke Chup Ke (I really Liked Kareena in this movie, I'm not a Kareena hater), Kuch Naa Kaho...those are very good cute films that at least leave you feeling satisfied, which this movie in my case, did not leave me feeling.",2,Try not to miss your train...,1225238400,"10 29, 2008",2008,1295,"['reading', 'reviews', 'Jab', 'Met', 'being', 'Bollywood', 'fan', 'went', 'out', 'brought', 'movie.I', 'was', 'imagining', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'light', 'simplistically', 'beautiful', 'rare', 'new', 'find', 'sea', 'predictable', 'hindi', 'films', 'are', 'fan', 'want', 'movie', 'sweep', 'feet', 'Jab', 'Met', 'not', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'dissappointed', 'expectations', 'were', 'not', 'high', 'only', 'thing', 'out', 'brain', 'movie', 'Kareena', 'Kapoor', 'excessive', 'TALKING', 'not', 'keep', 'mouth', 'shut', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'Now', ""'m"", 'sure', 'writer', 'thought', 'was', 'making', 'lovable', 'character', 'audience', 'would', 'find', 'mindless', 'banter', 'appealing', 'adorable', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'Instead', 'shallow', 'conversations', 'usually', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'filled', 'better', 'story', 'line', 'other', 'cinematic', 'ventures.I', 'would', 'sincerely', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'even', 'see', 'shallow', 'expedient', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Spend', 'money', 'most', 'importantly', 'TIME', 'other', 'ones', 'Kal', 'Ho', 'Naa', 'Ho', 'Chup', 'Ke', 'Chup', 'Ke', 'really', 'Liked', 'Kareena', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'Kareena', 'hater', 'Kuch', 'Naa', 'Kaho', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'cute', 'films', 'least', 'leave', 'feeling', 'satisfied', 'movie', 'case', 'did', 'not', 'leave', 'feeling']",Jab We Met anglais

In all three of these movies, the slightly (or very) nutty girl tries to get the guy by doing anything that comes into her adorable head. The only difference in this Bollywood film is that the girl seems unaware of the reasons for her behavior, at least we can look at it this way. The important thing is that Aditya (ably played by appealing male lead Shahid Kapoor) and Geet (excellently played by the exquisite Kareen Kapoor) have met, and that, one way or another, they do finally marry. They make a great couple; she's full of manic energy and life, and he's a melancholy millionaire who needs her influence so he can come back to life. The entire movie is a flashback relating to their children how they met.The stars apparently have not been married, though they were dating for a few years before this movie, after which they seperated! That's almost the opposite of this movie's plot.  Kareen Kapoor won Filfare's Best Actress Award for '07 for her energetic and fine-tuned performance as the nutty girl who gets the level-headed guy and inspires him to take back his life and then to excel.

1129996,A290A3XO7XK33X,B001165BG0,Prominence,"[14, 15]","Well she didn't miss the train this time. Jab We Met fell into my lap from Amazon ad and I proceeded to read online reviews which had something to the effect of:- boy meets girl- boy helps ""damsel in distress""- boy takes girl home- family mistakes him for her finance- boy and girl try to prove them wrong- finally boy and girl realize they are in love and the rest as they say ""is history""If you're familiar with Bollywood productions, I bet you can name quite a few movies with the same premise of which Dhaai Akshar Prem Ke is one.  Maybe then you can relate with my initial cynicism about Jab We Met. But I got to see the movie, and I was smitten then I got hooked and the rest again ""is history"".Okay so I'll try to move into the movie review.  Well ""Jab We Met"" does have the above mentioned plot to it and seriously there's nothing original or suspenseful about it.  You know where the story is going 15mins into the movie, but what keeps you glued to your seat really is how we get to the ""last train stop"". And yes, metaphorically, catching trains is the theme of this movie; a shade of meaning for not missing out on love.Here it is: Aditya Kashyap (Shahid Kapoor) is a very rich young man who has just inherited his father's shares in a large Indian corporation. A number of things missing in his life (can't say coz u won't have fun watching the movie) cause him to walk out on a very important boardroom meeting. He mindlessly roams the streets and eventually gets on a train. In comes Miss Motormouth aka Geet (Kareena Kapoor).  She just can't seem to shut up. She even talks about shoe-shopping in her sleep! One thing leads to the other and Aditya gets stuck with Geet and he has to take her home. Then they go their separate ways, but somehow it seems they'd never stop meeting by chance, and then the climax. Unfortunately this is where I ""shut-up"" so you can have fun watching this movie.Cons:- Nothing new about the plot- Nothing monumental about the scriptPros:- Believable chemistry between Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor (one of the movie's biggest driving machine)- This is my first view of Shahid Kapoor and I must say he's quite talented.  His interpretation of this guy is very mature especially in the nuances. For instance the first time Geet misses her train and she chose to shift the blame, you can't help but feel sorry for the perpetrator instead of the victim (according to Geet's judgement book). Kareena is yelling at the top of her lungs and this guy's response wasn't in kind. In fact, he was so calm that I went ""This man is going places if he chooses to remain an actor"". And I must confess I usually skip through opening credits in a movie, but Shahid is quite engaging as a man in despair as he walks the streets of Mumbai that I just couldn't get myself to skip the opening.- Hum...almost forgot the songs. Yes the songs! I thought they were good. My favorite is Nagada. If your ears are tuned to heavy percussion instruments in music then I bet you'll like it too. Besides the choreography isn't too bad. Plus the dancers are not stiff especially Shahid. He dances well enough that one can safely say ""Watch out Hrithik Roshan, looks like you have a competition in Shahid""- Finally, if you are reading this review then I know you most likely have some interest in Bollywood, so check out this movie. This movie in one word is CUTE. If you like cute, then I bet you'll like this movie too. If not just check it out anyway; no harm done.",5,"""You know for months I've been dreaming of missing the train...""",1206662400,"03 28, 2008",2008,3482,"['Well', 'did', ""n't"", 'miss', 'train', 'time', 'Jab', 'Met', 'fell', 'lap', 'Amazon', 'ad', 'proceeded', 'read', 'online', 'reviews', 'had', 'something', 'effect', 'boy', 'girl-', 'boy', 'damsel', 'distress', 'boy', 'girl', 'home-', 'family', 'mistakes', 'finance-', 'boy', 'girl', 'try', 'prove', 'wrong-', 'finally', 'boy', 'girl', 'realize', 'are', 'love', 'rest', 'say', 'history', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'Bollywood', 'productions', 'bet', 'can', 'name', 'quite', 'few', 'movies', 'same', 'premise', 'Dhaai', 'Akshar', 'Prem', 'Ke', 'one', 'Maybe', 'then', 'can', 'relate', 'initial', 'cynicism', 'Jab', 'Met', 'got', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'smitten', 'then', 'got', 'hooked', 'rest', 'again', 'history', 'so', ""'ll"", 'try', 'move', 'movie', 'review', 'Well', 'Jab', 'Met', 'have', 'above', 'mentioned', 'plot', 'seriously', 'nothing', 'original', 'suspenseful', 'know', 'where', 'story', 'going', '15mins', 'movie', 'what', 'glued', 'seat', 'really', 'how', 'get', 'last', 'train', 'stop', 'yes', 'metaphorically', 'catching', 'trains', 'theme', 'movie', 'shade', 'meaning', 'not', 'missing', 'out', 'love.Here', 'Aditya', 'Kashyap', 'Shahid', 'Kapoor', 'very', 'rich', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'inherited', 'father', 'shares', 'large', 'Indian', 'corporation', 'number', 'things', 'missing', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'coz', 'u', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'fun', 'watching', 'movie', 'cause', 'walk', 'out', 'very', 'important', 'boardroom', 'meeting', 'mindlessly', 'streets', 'eventually', 'train', 'Miss', 'Motormouth', 'aka', 'Geet', 'Kareena', 'Kapoor', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'shut', 'up', 'even', 'talks', 'shoe-shopping', 'sleep', 'One', 'thing', 'other', 'Aditya', 'stuck', 'Geet', 'take', 'home', 'Then', 'go', 'separate', 'ways', 'somehow', ""'d"", 'never', 'stop', 'meeting', 'chance', 'then', 'climax', 'Unfortunately', 'where', 'shut-up', 'can', 'have', 'fun', 'watching', 'movie.Cons', 'Nothing', 'new', 'plot-', 'Nothing', 'monumental', 'scriptPros', 'Believable', 'chemistry', 'Shahid', 'Kapoor', 'Kareena', 'Kapoor', 'one', 'movie', 'biggest', 'driving', 'machine', 'first', 'view', 'Shahid', 'Kapoor', 'must', 'say', 'quite', 'talented', 'interpretation', 'guy', 'very', 'mature', 'especially', 'nuances', 'instance', 'first', 'time', 'Geet', 'train', 'chose', 'shift', 'blame', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'sorry', 'perpetrator', 'instead', 'victim', 'according', 'Geet', 'judgement', 'book', 'Kareena', 'yelling', 'top', 'lungs', 'guy', 'response', 'was', ""n't"", 'kind', 'fact', 'was', 'so', 'calm', 'went', 'man', 'going', 'places', 'remain', 'actor', 'must', 'confess', 'usually', 'skip', 'opening', 'credits', 'movie', 'Shahid', 'quite', 'engaging', 'man', 'despair', 'streets', 'Mumbai', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'skip', 'opening.-', 'Hum', 'almost', 'forgot', 'songs', 'Yes', 'songs', 'thought', 'were', 'good', 'favorite', 'Nagada', 'ears', 'are', 'tuned', 'heavy', 'percussion', 'instruments', 'music', 'then', 'bet', ""'ll"", 'like', 'too', 'choreography', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'dancers', 'are', 'not', 'stiff', 'especially', 'Shahid', 'well', 'enough', 'one', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'Watch', 'out', 'Hrithik', 'Roshan', 'have', 'competition', 'Shahid', 'Finally', 'are', 'reading', 'review', 'then', 'know', 'most', 'likely', 'have', 'interest', 'Bollywood', 'so', 'check', 'out', 'movie', 'movie', 'one', 'word', 'CUTE', 'like', 'cute', 'then', 'bet', ""'ll"", 'like', 'movie', 'too', 'not', 'just', 'check', 'out', 'anyway', 'harm', 'done']",Jab We Met anglais

Both the DVD and Blu-ray have an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 (1920x1080) with Blu-ray at 24p.The DVD has a good picture quality (but the factory burn method or disc blank is not the best), so the Blu-ray is only a slight improvement in sharpness/detail.The color seems slightly better (more realistic) on the Blu-ray disc.  The optional subtitles are 95% the same between the DVD and the Blu-ray, but there are small differences (go figure).When FAST FORWARDING (or freeze frame) the Blu-ray has a significantly improved picture quality (no jaggies) compared to those type actions with the DVD.The Blu-ray audio is DTS capable, while the DVD audio is only Dolby Digital capable.If you can afford the Blu-ray and don't already have the DVD (which is pretty good quality for a DVD), then I think it is reasonable to buy theBlu-ray for the slight improvements (just really bummed there are NO BONUS items at all, since this movie SCREAMS for the fun/interesting extras they could have included).",5,Blu-ray: No bonus material,1281139200,"08 7, 2010",2010,1493,"['Very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'great', 'natural', 'acting/story', 'theme', 'music', 'beautiful', 'really', 'used', 'well', 'several', 'story', 'points.Unfortunately', 'expensive', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'bonus', 'material', 'just', 'movie', 'DVD', 'main', 'menu', 'concept/look', 'better', 'Blu-ray', 'main', 'menu', 'nit-pick', '.I', 'own', 'Blu-ray', 'best', 'version', 'DVD', 'Dec', '2007', 'release', 'anamorphic', 'highest', 'bit-rate', 'front', 'cover', 'back-to-back', 'wearing', 'red', 'dress', 'so', 'was', 'able', 'compare', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'have', 'aspect', 'ratio', '2.35:1', '1920x1080', 'Blu-ray', '24p.The', 'DVD', 'good', 'picture', 'quality', 'factory', 'burn', 'method', 'disc', 'blank', 'not', 'best', 'Blu-ray', 'only', 'slight', 'improvement', 'sharpness/detail.The', 'color', 'slightly', 'better', 'more', 'realistic', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'optional', 'subtitles', 'are', '95', '%', 'same', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'are', 'small', 'differences', 'go', 'figure', '.When', 'FAST', 'FORWARDING', 'freeze', 'frame', 'Blu-ray', 'significantly', 'improved', 'picture', 'quality', 'jaggies', 'compared', 'type', 'actions', 'DVD.The', 'Blu-ray', 'audio', 'DTS', 'capable', 'DVD', 'audio', 'only', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'capable.If', 'can', 'afford', 'Blu-ray', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'have', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'good', 'quality', 'DVD', 'then', 'think', 'reasonable', 'buy', 'theBlu-ray', 'slight', 'improvements', 'just', 'really', 'bummed', 'are', 'NO', 'BONUS', 'items', 'movie', 'SCREAMS', 'fun/interesting', 'extras', 'could', 'have', 'included']",Jab We Met anglais

Scenes that are natural and sweet in ""Jab We Met"" could only be played with irony here, and that's too bad.I remember when ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Tiger"" was such a hit here in the U.S. It was as if no one in American filmmaking had ever thought of showing, without explanation or apology, warriors who could leap to the treetops, as if such a thing were naturally within human power and capable of being filmed in real time.

1130003,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B001165BG0,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","""Jab We Met"" is a likable romantic comedy that stars Shahid Kapur and Kareena Kapoor as a pair of opposites brought together by a quirk of fate. Aditya [Shahid Kapur] is a young industrialist who is facing failure whilst at the helm of a company inherited from his father. To add insult to injury, he has also been jilted by his ex-girlfriend for another man. Feeling desperate and disillusioned, he abandons everything and boards a train at random. On the train, he meets a hyper-talkative young lass, Geet [Kareena Kapoor] who won't stop jabbering, annoying him immensely. The pair find themselves being thrown together despite Aditya's best efforts to shake Geet off, and he finds himself acting as Geet's escort as she finds her way home to Punjab. Along the way, both learn more about one another, Aditya finding Geet's optimistic and 'facing problems head on' attitude refreshing. Ironically, Geet later finds herself being consoled by Aditya as she faces her own personal crisis. The story is basically about two opposite souls who find that they actually share incredible chemistry with one another and bring out the best in each other.The acting in this production was top-notch, especially by the two leads. In fact, I have watched Kareena in many other Bollywood movies and would rank this as one of her best performances. Initially, her performance in this movie comes across as annoying, with her incessant and inconsequential chit-chat, but over time, her  character is credibly developed to portray an emotionally vulnerable character that elicits one's sympathy. Shahid Kapur is also credible in his performance as the emotionally tormented soul who eventually learns to let go of his pain and make his peace with his past.The songs were not really catchy or memorable, but the storyline and acting kept this movie fresh and interesting.",4,Light-hearted Bollywood romantic comedy with substance,1238112000,"03 27, 2009",2009,1853,"['Jab', 'Met', 'likable', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Shahid', 'Kapur', 'Kareena', 'Kapoor', 'pair', 'opposites', 'brought', 'together', 'quirk', 'fate', 'Aditya', '[', 'Shahid', 'Kapur', ']', 'young', 'industrialist', 'who', 'facing', 'failure', 'whilst', 'helm', 'company', 'inherited', 'father', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'also', 'been', 'jilted', 'ex-girlfriend', 'man', 'Feeling', 'desperate', 'disillusioned', 'everything', 'boards', 'train', 'random', 'train', 'hyper-talkative', 'young', 'lass', 'Geet', '[', 'Kareena', 'Kapoor', ']', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stop', 'jabbering', 'annoying', 'immensely', 'pair', 'find', 'being', 'thrown', 'together', 'Aditya', 'best', 'efforts', 'shake', 'Geet', 'acting', 'Geet', 'escort', 'way', 'home', 'Punjab', 'way', 'learn', 'more', 'one', 'Aditya', 'finding', 'Geet', 'optimistic', ""'facing"", 'problems', 'head', 'attitude', 'refreshing', 'Ironically', 'Geet', 'later', 'being', 'consoled', 'Aditya', 'own', 'personal', 'crisis', 'story', 'basically', 'about', 'two', 'opposite', 'souls', 'who', 'find', 'actually', 'share', 'incredible', 'chemistry', 'one', 'bring', 'out', 'best', 'other.The', 'acting', 'production', 'was', 'top-notch', 'especially', 'two', 'leads', 'fact', 'have', 'watched', 'Kareena', 'many', 'other', 'Bollywood', 'movies', 'would', 'rank', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'Initially', 'performance', 'movie', 'annoying', 'incessant', 'inconsequential', 'chit-chat', 'time', 'character', 'credibly', 'developed', 'portray', 'emotionally', 'vulnerable', 'character', 'one', 'sympathy', 'Shahid', 'Kapur', 'also', 'credible', 'performance', 'emotionally', 'tormented', 'soul', 'who', 'eventually', 'let', 'go', 'pain', 'make', 'peace', 'past.The', 'songs', 'were', 'not', 'really', 'catchy', 'memorable', 'storyline', 'acting', 'kept', 'movie', 'fresh', 'interesting']",Jab We Met anglais

There is an unfolding of their stories as the film progresses, and the lessons she teaches him, he ends up teaching her when her life and her spirit falls apart.  These two characters are attractive and fun to watch.The story a bit drawn out, mistaken identities and a not very believable love story included, and a few cheesy effects that made me laugh (model trains and autos -- perhaps they were placed tongue in cheek? it didn't strike me as a low budget flick to me) but it retained it's charm.It's a cute film, light, with an obligatory dance sequence.
