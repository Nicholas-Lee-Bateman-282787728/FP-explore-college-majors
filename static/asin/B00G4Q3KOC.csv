1676484,A2K2DMOM2BJSKP,B00G4Q3KOC,Adam Rodriguez,"[1, 2]","This is a true story of a free black man, a man that had all the equal freedom of a white man in the 1800's, all the luxuries, he was well taught, was an excellent violin player and knew how to read and write, lived in a nice house.. he was free, one day he was tricked to play for money by two white men who got him drunk and sold him into slavery. He was kidnapped, and the heart-dropping adventure begins there. This movie is unlike other slave movies, it's no BS, it's based on real events in this man's life.. this is a true story, based on a memoir written by Solomon Northup and the detail is truly eye opening. I say that every American should see this with an open mind, put yourself in Solomon's shoes, for a few hours, watch this movie, and see the torture and pain black men and women had to go through in those times. There are a lot of people here that say &#34;this movie is boring&#34;, i say no, this movie is full of adventure, it keeps you intrigued with how the story will end, a lot of close calls for Solomon.. this is truly worthy for an oscar, and is truly worthy of you to watch.. it's extremely educational, eye opening, and jaw dropping.. but be warned, reality bites. If you're white, you might cringe, but WATCH IT! It is an excellent film for all types of men and women, I suggest that kids under the age of 13 shouldnt watch this film, as there is a lot of violence, blood, gorish scenes, rape scenes, and nudity, and course language. I can't recommend this film enough, you will appreciate freedom and what you have a lot more after watching this. As for people who might think this is bias against white caucasians, no, there are a lot of amazing and non-racist white people in this film, one of which saved Solomon's life. So please don't think this is an anti-white film, it's truly not.

1676495,A2UFGJCMHUI74C,B00G4Q3KOC,Always Cogitating,"[0, 0]","Great movie that has stirred up much needed awareness about slavery in the US. We have to confront the fact that white people of the times were unmoved by these horrors, although many did fight very passionately to end it.  Maybe like today, it's mainly black people who go into the streets to protest the green light in the murder of Trayvon Martin.The relevance has been emphasized the past couple of weeks -- with the US Supreme court denying the need for Affirmative Action, in spite of the extreme disparities in college enrollment that continue; with the repeated claims by ignorant white activists (like the &#34;folk hero&#34; Clive Bundy ranting how black people were better off as slaves); and then the public &#34;outing&#34; of Donald Sterling's plantation master's views of &#34;his&#34; black basketball players....These on top of the two highly publicized cases of black youth murdered in cold blood by white men, who were not found guilty of murder... And outrageous incarceration statistics that show there has been mass incarceration of black men (and increasingly black women and Latino men) in the US for several decades.SLAVERY IS NOT BEHIND US... Race based slavery is a defining part of the United States, where a lot of the foundation of its wealth came from,  and race based discrimination continues to be essential to keeping people divided and accepting a broken economic system that only benefits a handful.

1676496,AJVFPC26GHXGF,B00G4Q3KOC,"Amanda Felix ""angelbuff""","[1, 1]","Alert: If you have not seen the movie there might be some spoilersI must confess I did not read the book but was told the movie was great and worthy of the Oscars. I disagree on both counts. Was the movie good, yes, there is no doubt about it but so much history was left out that should have been delved into. The fact that free black men lived, thrived, were respected and even owned business without repercussion should have at least been given more than a few minutes on screen. And unless you pay attention or know history, it will leave you confused. As confusing as when he was taken and sold. It should have at least explained the reason this was happening and with frequency during a part of American history when Congress had abolished slave trading so that no new slaves could be brought in from around the world. The only way to refresh the slave population was to kidnap the free black men from the North because they would not be known in the South and once in the hands of slavers your previous life is pretty much over and were given a new name and forged papers. Our country was divided and while slavery was a brutal trade it was not well received in many places, some of them even in the south.Solomon Northup is  a freeman living in New York and highly respected violinist, has a loving wife and 2 beautiful daughter he adores.  Unfortunately he is tricked into a possible venture, drugged and sold. That too was downplayed and should have been given more attention since any family torn apart would have been devastated. Nor was there any mention of people and friends even trying to look for him which I am sure there were many.After being stripped, hosed down and powdered(for lice) he is given clean, clothes and sent to a house where he and the other slaves are paraded like prize cattle for the shoppers to view. No amount of music(there is an all black orchestra playing soft classical music in the room) lace, wine or plates of hor d'oeuvres can mask the fact this is a slave market. It is a sad tragedy that many families were torn apart in the slave markets and this one is no different as a woman is bought but her two small children are taken away sold to others. If that scene does not grip you heart then nothing from there on will.  Solomon endured 12 hellish years as he tries to conform or be severely beaten, traded from one abusive Plantation owner to another. Even his name has been changed and if hints of knowing how to read could find him at the end of a rope. It is sad when one whom he trusted turns against him and is left to hang and children are in the background playing, hardened to the reality of their life and what could happen to them.He does try to get messages out but finds that anyone that he might trust is in fear of being caught aiding a slave so he continues in his existence but he never forgets who he is or where he came from. During his last years as a slave, he meets Patsy, a beautiful young woman who is the object of affection of the plantation master. Of course this does not sit well with his wife since he does little to cover the lust he has for her. She becomes a target not only for the master and his sexual whims but the wife who transfers all her hate, humiliation and obvious lack of love from her husband to Patsy. Patsy suffers tremendously and her story should have been given almost as much time as Solomon's because her plight was just as devastating as was the plight of most black women during these horrible times. She was severely whipped just to show that she was not that favored to appease the wife. Was Lupita Nyong'o deserved of an Oscar... my opinion is no... while her performance was excellent it was not stellar and she received almost as screen time as the plantation owners wife whose performance was equally good.Brad Pitt enters late in the movie as a carpenter who is building a gazebo and he makes no attempt to hide the disgust he feels for the owning of slaves. But he is also a lone white man that must keep most of his opinon to himself for it is a very dangerous place he can find himself in. It is while constructing the structure he learns that Solomon is quite the learned man. And eventually he learns just who Solomon is and decides to help.Of course we know that Solomon is rescued after 12 years of enslavement, and the man that comes to his aid is a white man who dares to stand up to the Plantation owner and promises legal reprisal for his treatment, kidnapping and abuse of Solomon. And here in my opinion is the saddest part of the movie as Solomon is led away, once again a freeman and the other slaves, Patsy included watch him leave knowing that for them there is no escape, no one is coming to free them, no one is going to rescue them.He is reunited with his family and even that I bittersweet for him. The telling of his story in the movie(I did not read the book) should be made required reading or viewing to school children of all ethnic groups. It is a part of our history that needs to be retold, never forgotten without political correctness ever entering into it. It should be a discussion that should be held in the classrooms and in the homes partly because slavery, buying and selling of humans, particularly young women of all ethnic backgrounds, is still very much alive in other parts of the world with no one doing much of anything to stop it or turn a blind eye.Was it a good movie, yes.. a sad, tragic and unrelenting part of our country's history that should never be forgotten or ignored... but a movie that could have been so much greater.",3,Great opportunity missed,1399507200,"05 8, 2014",2014,5585,"['Alert', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'movie',

Unfortunately it is being &#34;debunked&#34; by so-called experts who have no idea what they are talking about. William Seay's One-Star review comes to mind. He harps on &#34;honest depictions of slavery&#34; as if one's bondage was a vacation instead of atrocity; or that &#34;it wasn't as bad as they make it out be.&#34;I'm glad that movies are being made by Hollywood in this genre. This is not a movie that would have been made 30 years ago. Yet not only was it made it was made with an adroit aplomp. I highly recommend this movie to students of history and also those who have yet to learn about this terrible time in American history. The savagery of the American South just like that of Nazi Germany will always stain those places.I won't go into too much detail on the plot. Others have done a better job of that than I could. I will say that the actors are fantastic. Fassbender put himself right up there with Ralph Fiennes (Schindler's List) as despicable villains. He truly deserved an Oscar for his portrayal. He made me believe he was a Southern slave owner. His brutal savagery belied a multilayered-character who ruled his fiefdom with an iron fist. He would not let any of his slaves be taken from him and this is depicted with absolute preciseness in the end of the movie. When I looked into his face on screen I saw the faces of Stacy Koon and Laurence Powell. Absolute pure evil. He sold it well in his portrayal. After only a moment of screen time I hated him. Ironically, his wife may have been even more evil than he was.View this movie and you will see a side of America many (William Seay & K. Hemmerling) want to deny.

1676506,A12DQZKRKTNF5E,B00G4Q3KOC,Andrea Polk,"[0, 0]","This movie won Best Picture at the 2014 Oscars, which was part of the reason I rented it.  The other part, I was interested in the story. I had not read the book, so I had no preconceived notion of what to expect, other than the main character would be a slave for 12 years, per the title.  I was pleased to know it was based upon a true story, and looked forward to learning more and experiencing a richness that you experience when you are transported to another time.The beginning of the movie gives you a date and a place as a starting point, but from then on, you're on your own to try and figure out how much time has lapsed.  Maybe that was on purpose?  Maybe it was done to make the viewer feel the loss of time Solomon (the main character) feels?  Multiple times throughout the movie I found myself wondering:  &#34;Where are we in this 12 year span?&#34;Which brings me to the most frustrating part of this film, and the reason I give it 3 (It's OK) versus 5 (I love it) stars.  The movie drags tremendously after the first forty minutes.  I think the entire film could have been shortened considerably or improved by enriching (some may say embellishing...) the story with the building of relationships and showing the viewers more about Solomon's previous life through the use of flashbacks, which were already being used.  There were way too many slow scenes which I'm sure were designed to let the viewers soak in the hopelessness, but for this viewer they were just 'hopeless'.The acting is excellent from all, and the brutality of slavery as shown in the movie made me squirm in my seat.  I will not soon forget the story, or the ugliness portrayed.The story, a tragedy which fortunately, has a end that becomes a new beginning.  I do wish the story on film had included more depth regarding interpersonal relationships though.  I see this as a tragedy of missed opportunity to add to the creative tapestry that was started, but in my opinion, not finished with this award winning movie.The movie chooses to focus on what happened without any clear timeline.  It does pay homage to all the people who were thrown unexpectedly into slavery, and gives us a gritty glimpse into what life for them must have been like.  However it's an unnecessarily long film that lacks an expression that would be felt if the viewers had more of a feeling for, and understanding of, who Solomon was  outside of being a slave.",3,A long 12 years,1395964800,"03 28, 2014",2014,2422,"['movie', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', '2014', 'Oscars', 'was', 'part', 'reason', 'rented', 'other', 'part', 'was', 'interested', 'story', 'had', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'had', 'preconceived', 'notion', 'what', 'expect', 'other', 'main', 'character', 'would', 'be', 'slave', '12', 'years', 'title', 'was', 'pleased', 'know', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'looked', 'forward', 'learning', 'more', 'experiencing', 'richness', 'experience', 'when', 'are', 'transported', 'time.The', 'beginning', 'movie', 'date', 'place', 'starting', 'point', 'then', ""'re"", 'own', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'lapsed', 'Maybe', 'was', 'purpose', 'Maybe', 'was', 'done', 'make', 'viewer', 'feel', 'loss', 'time', 'Solomon', 'main', 'character', 'feels', 'Multiple', 'times', 'movie', 'found', 'wondering', '34', 'Where', 'are', '12', 'year', 'span', '34', 'Which', 'most', 'frustrating', 'part', 'film', 'reason', 'give', '3', 'OK', 'versus', '5', 'love', 'movie', 'tremendously', 'first', 'forty', 'minutes', 'think', 'entire', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shortened', 'considerably', 'improved', 'enriching', 'may', 'say', 'embellishing', 'story', 'building', 'relationships', 'showing', 'viewers', 'more', 'Solomon', 'previous', 'life', 'use', 'flashbacks', 'were', 'already', 'being', 'used', 'were', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'slow', 'scenes', ""'m"", 'sure', 'were', 'designed', 'let', 'viewers', 'soak', 'hopelessness', 'viewer', 'were', 'just', ""'hopeless'.The"", 'acting', 'excellent', 'brutality', 'slavery', 'shown', 'movie', 'made', 'squirm', 'seat', 'will', 'not', 'soon', 'forget', 'story', 'ugliness', 'portrayed.The', 'story', 'tragedy', 'fortunately', 'end', 'new', 'beginning', 'do', 'wish', 'story', 'film', 'had', 'included', 'more', 'depth', 'regarding', 'interpersonal', 'relationships', 'see', 'tragedy', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'add', 'creative', 'tapestry', 'was', 'started', 'opinion', 'not', 'finished', 'award', 'winning', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'focus', 'happened', 'clear', 'timeline', 'pay', 'homage', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'thrown', 'unexpectedly', 'slavery', 'gritty', 'glimpse', 'what', 'life', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'However', 'unnecessarily', 'long', 'film', 'expression', 'would', 'be', 'felt', 'viewers', 'had', 'more', 'feeling', 'understanding', 'who', 'Solomon', 'was', 'being', 'slave']",12 Years a Slave

1676509,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00G4Q3KOC,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","I have to admit, I&#8217;m honestly torn here.  Figuring out how to honestly address the concerns that I have with a film that many have lauded as one of the most important films of our time is difficult, but being honest is the most important thing that anyone can be when compiling their thoughts on a film.  What&#8217;s the point in writing a review if you&#8217;re merely going to cower to what everyone else is saying in an attempt to be liked?  But, in the same way that I am torn at the idea of writing this review, I&#8217;m also torn with regards to the film itself, a film that had all the right intentions and the right storyline and yet failed in so many areas due to the mishandling of key attributes by the film&#8217;s director, Steve McQueen.That actually really hurt me to say.I&#8217;ve been intrigued by McQueen&#8217;s career since his first feature film in 2008, &#8216;Hunger&#8217;.  He had such a harsh and dominating style, one that drew you in to each solitary moment and held you there, sometimes for extended moments, to make you feel each and every fiber of the film.  &#8216;Shame&#8217; was a brilliant depiction of suffering, addiction and anguish and was filmed with such precision, necessary detachment and obvious passion.  When it was announced that McQueen&#8217;s next film was going to be &#8217;12 Years a Slave&#8217; it was instantly one of my most anticipated of 2013.  Often, the complaint thrown at films of this nature is that they are too sentimental and because of that they lack the harsh realism needed to make these stories truth telling.  McQueen seemed like the perfect voice, because his sentimental values have always been subtle; instead offering us a coldness that felt more honest.First, I want to express that &#8217;12 Years a Slave&#8217; is not a bad film at all.  In fact, there is a lot to really admire about it.  The story is a powerful one.  Solomon Northrup, a free man living in New York, is betrayed by men appearing as friends, drugged and ultimately sold into slavery with no way of defending himself.  He becomes a hired hand in Louisiana, tossed around from slave owner to slave owner because of his obvious learned background and his pent up frustrations (and refusal to be a dog).  For 12 years he lived in slavery before his story was properly heard and passed along the proper channel and he was able to be reunited with his wife and children.  This is a story that needed to be told, and one that I&#8217;m happy was told.  As far as his story goes, it is told relatively well thanks to a beautiful performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor, who anchors this movie with such complete awareness of character.But I&#8217;ll get back to that in a minute.I say that his story is told relatively well because outside of Ejiofor&#8217;s performance, the story, I feel, is somewhat mishandled.  McQueen&#8217;s approach to this film is vastly different from the way he attacked his previous two features, and I&#8217;m not sure if that was intentional, but there is something amiss here.  When it was first announced that this film was being made, I declared that there was no way this was going to be an Oscar player.  McQueen is too harsh a filmmaker, too honest.  There is no way that the Academy, a body made up largely of elderly white men, is going to embrace a film about the harsh realities of racism and slavery.  I was baffled when it started to pick up such steam in the race for Best Picture of the Year, but now that I&#8217;ve seen the film, it all makes sense.This is Steve McQueen&#8217;s &#8216;Schindler&#8217;s List&#8217;.I know that that doesn&#8217;t sound like a particularly bad thing, and in all honesty I do feel that &#8216;Schindler&#8217;s List&#8217; is a very good film (I even said earlier in this review that this was a good film as well), but I have always felt detached from &#8216;Schindler&#8217;s List&#8217; for a very specific reason, and it is the same reason that I feel detached from McQueen&#8217;s film; it&#8217;s far too clinical.  &#8217;12 Years a Slave&#8217; tries too hard to be too perfect, too correct, but unlike &#8216;Schindler&#8217;s List&#8217;, not everyone in this film is up to the task of conveying this &#8216;correctness&#8217;, and because of that the film starts to falter.While the entire cast has been lauded by critic after critic, there were only two performances here that I felt were honest enough, or grounded enough, to survive McQueen&#8217;s direction; Ejiofor and Lupita Nyong&#8217;o.  These two performances held such authenticity in their movements.  Ejiofor, as I mentioned above, is so aware of his character.  He understands every layer of the man, and this is scene in the way he soaks in his surroundings in those giants wells he calls eyes.  You can read every inner thought, and those thoughts are never &#8216;how do I act this scene&#8217; (unlike a few of his co-stars).  Instead, Ejiofor is living this performance.  Some have commented that he is merely a walking ghost, but Northup WAS a ghost, for 12 years, constantly living in the horrors of loss and carrying the fear of death on his shoulders.  What I found particularly alarming (in a good way) about Ejiofor&#8217;s performance was that you could sense his character not only taking in HIS surroundings, but also taking in the realities of a world he didn&#8217;t give much thought to before.  He was a free black man.  He had a job and a family and a home and was respected and beloved by men and women, black and white.  While this was an atrocious situation for him to find himself, you can see that he is finally becoming aware of a world much larger than he was himself.It is a true testament to the strength of this narrative that I am actually finding myself WANTING to like this movie more than I do as I&#8217;m writing this review.Being honest can be hard.Anyways, Nyong&#8217;o is the only other actor I felt reached Ejiofor&#8217;s depths (maybe not quite as deep, but close) of earthy realism.  While many have criticized her performance for the very thing I&#8217;m criticizing this film for (trying too hard), I was truly moved by every hand gesture, every cringe, every single movement.  It may have all been calculated (and I won&#8217;t deny that it was) but it felt so fluid and authentic, which is NOT the case with those around her.Yes, I&#8217;m talking about Michael Fassbender, Alfre Woodard, Sarah Paulson, Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti, Adepero Oduye and especially Brad Pitt (what in the WORLD was he doing?) and pretty much everyone in this film aside from the aforementioned and Benedict Cumberbatch.  These performances felt too correct, too exact and because of that they feel forced, inauthentic and take me out of the film itself.  Fassbender in particular (an actor I LOVE and have declared THE actor of his generation) is so out of his depth here.  You can see him attempting to &#8216;portray&#8217; in every scene as opposed to just living this character.  It always feels like a performance.  The whipping scene in particular is so disengaging, which is highlighted even more because both Nyong&#8217;o and Ejiofor are so IN that moment that when Fassbender comes over yelling and screaming and ACTING it almost made me cringe.There are no words for what Brad Pitt did in this film.  It was honestly a disgrace and one of the worst scenes in any film I&#8217;ve seen this year.  It wasn&#8217;t even just his performance itself, which was awful, but the phrasing of the scene itself which felt so forced and abrupt.That is another issue I have with &#8217;12 Years a Slave&#8217;.  There is absolutely NO consciousness of time here.  12 years come and go and for all I know it was a really long weekend.  No one ages, no one truly grows, everything pretty much stays the same from scene one to scene whatever and it just all felt so singular.  Maybe this was intentional.  Maybe the idea was to make these 12 years feel like one elongated nightmare, but the passing of time is what would have made the trials heaped on Northup feel all the more harrowing, and so I think this element is a truly important one, and one that significantly hurt this film.And then there is the actual harshness of the film.  I&#8217;m not saying that I wanted &#8216;Passion of the Christ&#8217; style gore here (and, for the record, I&#8217;ve never seen that film but know of its reputation) but I will say that I expected something more from McQueen in the depiction of the brutal realities of slavery.  Maybe this should be linked alongside my issues with the film&#8217;s &#8216;correctness&#8217;, but it felt as if McQueen was holding back so much for fear of alienating his core audience; white people.  I won&#8217;t say that he white washed this or sugar coated anything, and then again maybe I am.  Outside of the fact that they were slaves (and the whipping scene and the scene where Paulson&#8217;s character threw a bottle of alcohol at Nyong&#8217;o&#8217;s face) this film never seemed to get into the gritty truth about the treatment of these people, and that is a shame.  Even the rape scene felt oddly reserved.For all of these criticisms, I&#8217;ve said and will continue to say that &#8217;12 Years a Slave&#8217; is a good film.  Its Oscar win is actually understandable under the circumstances.  This was a way for Hollywood to say &#8216;what was done was wrong&#8217; on their own terms, and it does get the point across.  Hollywood loves a technically &#8216;perfect&#8217; film that allows them to detach and not really &#8216;feel&#8217; but still act like they do.",4,Not exactly the 'perfect' I was looking

1676510,A286XNXOREIVWW,B00G4Q3KOC,ANJANI W.,"[1, 2]","African American here. First generation of my family raised in the north. I agree with other reviewers who say this is television movie of the week level drama and acting. Little better than good. Directing very poor. Screen play so very average. One day far in the future when none of it makes whites squirm we'll be allowed to tell our own story. To fail and succeed at trying to write screenplays, and cast the films we, my people, want to see made about this subject. Think of it like this. We needed many films about the Holocaust. One film could never capture the depth of horror, nor of human dignity and courage. We needed Schindler's List. We needed Sophie's Choice. We needed Anne Frank's book and the plays that have followed and the movies. One day, I can only pray for I am old now, one day there will be a wealth of film and books telling our stories, from every angle. 12/yrs a Slave was a mighty effort. The actors did their best with the material. But aside from our suffering, our slavish lives as beasts cruelly treated; aside from the fact that we had to turn our backs on one another to survive...there's nothing new here. Yet and still, I appreciate the effort. But I expected more. Roots showed our joy, our suffering, and our humanity. Beloved, as flawed as it was as a film, and it was God awful, in part, it still showed our insistent claim to our own dignity. Patsy does that in this film...but her story is clouded and unclear. So much so one reviewer, here on Amazon, thought she was merely the Master's play thing. The reviewer didn't seem to understand that she'd been nursed at the master's pap from a baby child to be his concubine and to accept every indignity and cruelty he cared to inflict. He's even shown with the new pet-colored-child slave he'll use next. Why this subject is always treated with subtlety I won't digress to discuss. We need more films, coming at this subject from wider, and narrower angles. Even more D'jango's, if need be, and all the yet unimagined rest. But most of all, African American people must be allowed to shape this story and tell it from our own experience...generations later, as imagined...because our ancestors were too ashamed, too eager to protect us, to tell us what truly happened. We are not degraded human beings. We are some of the greatest people on earth to have triumphed over the institution known as slavery. And yes, that institution has also robbed too many of us from our humanity...as it did the slave holders. I did appreciate seeing a white woman shown as perpetrator not victim. My people have known this for generations. This fact is made know without adornment in this film. Twice, on two plantations. One woman is shown as fueled by jealousy...while in fact she's as lustfully cruel as her husband. The other white woman doesn't want a grieving slave's grieving to disturb her lovely plantation life. Kudos for getting that on film. It cannot be said enough, that the institution of slavery would not have endured without the eager participation of white men AND women. And I also wish they'd shown the living conditions of poor whites. You all do realize that slave owners were essentially the 1%? Most whites were poor as Joe's turkey hen. Subsistence farming. Filthy living quarters down home int he dirty south. Whites in the pre and industrialized part of the country, also squalor and poverty. I couldn't give a film about slavery a two. My great grandfather was a slave. I asked his daughter, my great aunt, when she was one hundred years old, had her father ever said anything about slavery? He'd been a young child when slavery ended. But my aunt said, &#34;Nope he never said.&#34;",3,Pain and suffering begats more pain and suffering,1394928000,"03 16, 2014",2014,3688,"['African', 'American', 'here', 'First', 'generation', 'family', 'raised', 'north', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'say', 'television', 'movie', 'week', 'level', 'drama', 'acting', 'Little', 'better', 'good', 'Directing', 'very', 'poor', 'Screen', 'play', 'so', 'very', 'average', 'One', 'day', 'far', 'future', 'when', 'none', 'whites', ""'ll"", 'be', 'allowed', 'tell', 'own', 'story', 'fail', 'succeed', 'trying', 'write', 'screenplays', 'cast', 'films', 'people', 'want', 'see', 'made', 'subject', 'Think', 'needed', 'many', 'films', 'Holocaust', 'One', 'film', 'could', 'never', 'capture', 'depth', 'horror', 'human', 'dignity', 'courage', 'needed', 'Schindler', 'List', 'needed', 'Sophie', 'Choice', 'needed', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'book', 'plays', 'have', 'followed', 'movies', 'One', 'day', 'can', 'only', 'pray', 'am', 'old', 'now', 'one', 'day', 'will', 'be', 'wealth', 'film', 'books', 'telling', 'stories', 'angle', '12/yrs', 'Slave', 'was', 'mighty', 'effort', 'actors', 'did', 'best', 'material', 'aside', 'suffering', 'slavish', 'lives', 'beasts', 'cruelly', 'treated', 'aside', 'fact', 'had', 'turn', 'backs', 'one', 'survive', 'nothing', 'new', 'here', 'still', 'appreciate', 'effort', 'expected', 'more', 'Roots', 'showed', 'joy', 'suffering', 'humanity', 'Beloved', 'as', 'flawed', 'was', 'film', 'was', 'God', 'awful', 'part', 'still', 'showed', 'insistent', 'claim', 'own', 'dignity', 'Patsy', 'film', 'story', 'clouded', 'unclear', 'So', 'much', 'one', 'reviewer', 'here', 'Amazon', 'thought', 'was', 'merely', 'Master', 'play', 'thing', 'reviewer', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'understand', ""'d"", 'been', 'nursed', 'master', 'pap', 'baby', 'child', 'be', 'concubine', 'accept', 'indignity', 'cruelty', 'cared', 'inflict', 'even', 'shown', 'new', 'pet-colored-child', 'slave', ""'ll"", 'use', 'next', 'Why', 'subject', 'always', 'treated', 'subtlety', 'wo', ""n't"", 'digress', 'discuss', 'need', 'more', 'films', 'coming', 'subject', 'wider', 'narrower', 'angles', 'Even', 'more', ""D'jango"", 'need', 'be', 'yet', 'unimagined', 'rest', 'most', 'African', 'American', 'people', 'must', 'be', 'allowed', 'shape', 'story', 'tell', 'own', 'experience', 'generations', 'later', 'imagined', 'ancestors', 'were', 'too', 'ashamed', 'too', 'eager', 'protect', 'tell', 'truly', 'happened', 'are', 'not', 'degraded', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'greatest', 'people', 'earth', 'have', 'triumphed', 'institution', 'known', 'slavery', 'yes', 'institution', 'also', 'robbed', 'too', 'many', 'humanity', 'did', 'slave', 'holders', 'did', 'appreciate', 'seeing', 'white', 'woman', 'shown', 'perpetrator', 'not', 'victim', 'people', 'have', 'known', 'generations', 'fact', 'made', 'know', 'adornment', 'film', 'Twice', 'two', 'plantations', 'One', 'woman', 'shown', 'fueled', 'jealousy', 'fact', 'lustfully', 'cruel', 'husband', 'other', 'white', 'woman', ""n't"", 'want', 'grieving', 'slave', 'grieving', 'disturb', 'lovely', 'plantation', 'life', 'Kudos', 'getting', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'enough', 'institution', 'slavery', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'endured', 'eager', 'participation', 'white', 'men', 'women', 'also', 'wish', ""'d"", 'shown', 'living', 'conditions', 'poor', 'whites', 'do', 'realize', 'slave', 'owners', 'were', 'essentially', '1', '%', 'Most', 'whites', 'were', 'poor', 'Joe', 'turkey', 'hen', 'Subsistence', 'farming', 'Filthy', 'living', 'quarters', 'down', 'home', 'int', 'south', 'Whites', 'pre', 'industrialized', 'part', 'country', 'also', 'squalor', 'poverty', 'could', ""n't"", 'give', 'film', 'slavery', 'two', 'great', 'grandfather', 'was', 'slave', 'asked', 'daughter', 'great', 'aunt', 'when', 'was', 'one', 'hundred', 'years', 'old', 'had', 'father', 'ever', 'said', 'anything', 'slavery', ""'d"", 'been', 'young', 'child', 'when', 'slavery', 'ended', 'aunt', 'said', '34', 'never', 'said.', '34']",12 Years a Slave

The entire cast's acting was excellent, how they Portrayed the slaves' life's on the plantation farms in pre-civil war America and revealing The punishment and injustices they suffered every day at the hands of the plantation owners and confederate society as a whole was riveting and realistic.The stand out performances in this film is are by Michael Fassbender who plays one of the mean tempered plantation owners who forces his will on the slaves and even his own wife! One of the most memorable scenes is where he stands before the newly arrived slaves for the first time and imposes his bigoted attitude on them while quoting scipture from the bible about how african slaves should be treated by their white superiors and how they will undoubtedly suffer if they don't conform and obey!The second most memorable portrayal in the film is by ""Paul Giamatti"" who plays the slaver ""theophilus Freeman"" that brings the slaves to market for the plantation masters to purchase. He totally captures the role with nauseating realism, and definetley one of the best performances of the film!But what is disappointing is how the director has left out Solomon's family from the story line for the most part.

It was interesting to see this.Having said this the film is a rather fascinating picture of a free man enslaved. His struggle just to survive on a plantation.

If you combine Roots, Color Purple, and Django Unchained, even toss in Uncle Tom's Cabin, there is nothing new here at all. This has all been done on screen before. Especially Django Unchained. If you have seen that movie, this one suffers big time in comparison. Django was much better, and as far as I'm concerned, conveyed the horrors of white ownership much better. There is nothing new or original in THIS film.Second of all, I found Chiwetel Ejiofor, who I love, grossly misued and wasted. I swear to God, all he had to do was look distressed in about a million scenes. To the point where I just felt this leaden sinking feeling whenever he got on screen. His character, or how he was portrayed, was very problematic.Third, the way the director lingers on the sadistic violence. We know it happened. It's not like NO ONE'S ever shown or written about slave whippings before! So what was the intent with being so incredibly fascinated by it in this film? These sadism scenes have a lot in common with The Last Temptation of Christ. You feel like you are being drawn into some kind of porno violence scenario. Seems like that's the true intent here--enacting some fantasy scenario on the part of the director or writer. Who just happens to have set it in the world of slavery.On top of everything, I agree with reviewers who say it is boring. Leaden paced. Disjointed. Not enough about Solomon Northtrup.

1676564,A3LX5ELWX6HYK6,B00G4Q3KOC,Caligula II.,"[62, 291]","When this movie came out in the theaters, my first thought was ""this is gonna win the best movie oscar"". Not because it's that good, but simply for political reasons.Victimizing blacks is ""in"" today, because America is full of white racists (right, that explains why we have a black president twice in a row).With constantly victimizing blacks we are not doing them a favor though. We are just putting another boot on their throats telling them they cannot achieve anything without us.Sure enough 12 Years a slave is up for several academy awards (which in my opinion mean nothing anymore since the mid 90s), and I am sure it is going to walk away with most of them.The story about a free black man who is enslaved is tragic, no doubt. But after Django unchained and The Butler, 12 Years a slave has a completely different purpose entirely: instigating a race war seems to be our current president's agenda and Hollywood obediently complies. These movies serve but one purpose: whites should feel guilty, blacks should seek ""revenge"" (although no black American living today was ever a slave and the slavers have been dead for a very long time now). The man who before his first election claimed he would unite America is indeed doing exactly the opposite.Slavery was not an American problem, not a Southern problem. It was (and still IS in many moslem countries, where slavery still is LEGAL to this day) a world wide problem. So far every other country has gotten over it. Now it is time for America to do the same and not use slavery as an excuse for crimes committed by blacks.The real losers in America still are the native Americans and we don't feel compelled to throw a pity party for them nowadays anymore (one could almost assume that slavery is so much worse than genocide).The problem I have with 12 YEARS A SLAVE is not so much the theme itself, but rather the way it was staged and directed. The South consists of white racists only (when in fact only a MINORITY owned slaves), the white masters are not just villains, but monsters, and the only descent white person isn't American, but Canadian (Pitt's character), because God forbid, we cannot have any ""good"" white AMERICANS. This movie serves but one single goal, to incite hatred towards whites. The way it was directed, makes this very apparent. A better director would have made a difference here.""NO LIVING PEOPLE, BLACK OR WHITE, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT OTHER BLACK AND WHITE PEOPLE DID GENERATIONS AGO.""GET OVER IT!As I stated before, this review takes a deeper look at the movie's intent and political background.A (BLACK!) man, Booker T. Washington (1865-1915), a man born into slavery did not let slavery and black victimhood stand in the way of attaining respectable positions as an educator, author, orator and an advisor to presidents of the United States.Booker T. Washington warned of certain people within the black in his 1911 book MY LARGER EDUCATION, describing them as ""problem profiteers"":QUOTE""There is another class of coloured people who make a business of keeping the troubles, the wrongs and the hardships of the (Black) race before the public. Having learned that they are able to make a living out of their troubles, they have grown into the settled habit of advertising their wrongs - partly because they want sympathy and partly because it pays. Some of these people do not want the (Black) to lose his grievances, because they do not want to lose their jobs."" (p. 118)UNQUOTEAmerica still has a racist problem with many black racists coming out of the woodwork, claiming false victimhood - just as Washington said happened back is the early 1900s - supported by guilt-ridden white supporters. Any decent black man or woman contradicting them is accused as being an ""Uncle Tom"" while white people speaking out against them are being labeled ""racist"".12 YEARS A SLAVE plays right into these peoples' hands. It serves a number of purposes, namely, inciting hatred against whites, victimizing blacks today (""post-slave-disorder""), serving as a justification to commit crimes and most importantly, serving as a justification why blacks are entitled to special treatment and handout (reparations). If 12 YEARS A SLAVE had just been for educational purposes, it would have had to been staged a different way.America needs more blacks like Booker T. Washington. The black community is strong, it does not need to rely on black hardships of the past. There are a lot of black people who have accomplished a lot on their own, without constantly whining about slavery. But instead of honoring these people, blacks choose to continuously cripple themselves with the help of white liberals continously telling them that they are poor in incapable, while they keep them down in the ditch. THAT is TRUE racism.",1,"THE NEVER-ENDING ""WE WERE SLAVES""-PITY PARTY",1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,4794,"['When', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'theaters', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'gon', 'win',

The dilemma of a man, once free,  duped, kidnapped and sold into slavery in the South is a sad expression of the insecurity of life even in the northern states.  Only at the end of the film, the titles point out that kidnapping and selling of free persons into slavery was a common occurrence.  Perhaps this was a consequence of the pressure put on the importation of slaves from Africa (mainly by the British), making it worthwhile for unscrupulous slavers to  go to the trouble and expense of  kidnapping  and selling  free people.  There is something of a moral dilemma in the film's stress on the injustice of a free man becoming a slave.  What about the men and women who were born into slavery or captured in Africa rather than New York?  The pathos of that situation gets only a brief nod in the hero's tearful farewell from those remaining on the plantation.  The acting in this film is outstanding, especially the leads, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and the lovely Lupita Nyong'o.  The direction and editing of this film, notwithstanding Oscar are not outstanding.

There is so much wrong with the structure of this movie, such unbalanced acting and characterization and finally, such thin and unconnected plotting, that I found myself drifting off at times. This should have been called &#34;Staring: The Motion Picture.&#34; This is two hours of people STARING meaningfully, dramatically and tearfully, though rarely crying. It all feels hugely cold, technical and motivated by off-camera direction rather than heart -felt drama rising organically from the actors and writing. And the writing itself, while not bad, flows illogically at times, as though whole scenes were cut to leave us a dispirited hodgepodge of demo-reel moments. If that wasn't enough to undermine this effort, then stand by for dreadful ponderous scoring and some of the worst photographical decisions since The Color Purple. 12 Years a Slave breaks far too many rules for good story-telling to succeed. It's rarely engaging and floats on a laden log of assured racial respect, but little of it is earned. Perhaps it's a little less self conscious than The Help, but not enough for me to call it a good movie. Lupita Nyong'o won an Oscar for making boo-boo faces during rape and whipping scenes and staying mostly dry-eyed throughout. Somehow that's good acting.

However I understand why he didn&#8217;t win.  Because the decision makers for the Academy probably felt the same way I did.  That no human being with a conscience could play the Epps character so convincingly.  Seriously, if I were Fassbender, I would forbid any friends or family from watching this.  It&#8217;s impossible not to see him as the character, and if I knew Fassbender personally, I would never be able to look him in the eye after seeing this.Sarah Paulson as his wife is also despicable, but in a more feminine and passive aggressive way.There are no truly redeeming white people in this movie.  Even the &#8220;allies&#8221; are guilty in some way or another.  The slaves are too at some points, but they at least have the redeeming quality that they are trying to save their own skins.  This is the only reason I&#8217;d give it 4 instead of 5 stars.  It started to actually feel kind of racist to me to people of lighter and darker skin color.  I didn't feel like I was enlightened in any way; and there is no new material discussed in the movie.  The main character  did not stand out to me.  The supporting cast (especially the Patsy character) were so much more dynamic than Solomon himself - that is one woman's opinion folks, please don't start ranting at me.  Alfre Woodard's character (who plays a very small scene in this movie ) seemed as pertinent to me than the other players of the story.As was the case with Hunger and Shame, there are some quiet parts and some gaps that viewers just need to fill in on their own.  McQueen never gives us all the information we need, because it often isn't necessary to the story.  However, unlike those movies, there is nothing subtle about what is going on in the background and foreground during the quieter moments.

After months of hearing all the buzz and all the hype, finally having the opportunity to watch it, I just was not that thrilled or impressed.  Now don't get me wrong, it was beautifully shot, the cinematography had me floored, but after I got past that, I found that the acting was just average and the script paltry at best.  There were no standout scenes or performances in my opinion.  Chiwetel Ejiofor was good, but he wasn't great, which showed in his loss of the Academy Award.  Lupita Nyongo'o was okay, but those she was up against in her respected category of Best Supporting Actress from what I've read may have been slightly better.  As long as &#34;12 Years&#34; was, the movie was painstakingly slow.  Movies in this genre such as &#34;Roots&#34; and &#34;Amistad&#34; kept a steady pace and had several pivotal scenes throughout, but this movie almost made me lose interest several times due to its lack of ability to engage.For me, this movie proves the power of the Hollywood machine at its best.  All it takes is the right people behind a film, namely Brad Pitt and his Plan B company, and a campaign like no other that I've frankly never seen before, and the average can become exceptional.  We've seen this movie before, Hollywood has made this movie before, so what are they telling us that we don't already know or get?  But a movie like &#34;Fruitvale Station&#34; that depicts these same ideas and misconceptions and shows that they are still happening today as opposed to 150-something years ago gets no recognition or put on a pedestal to ignite social change.

I did not find the film at all believable and I do not find the story and/or adaptation believable either.  There are so many questions and holes in the tale that I am loathe to accept it as truth.  The memoir, being written by Solomon Northrup himself, and published in 1853 was one I had never heard of or even heard mentioned before this film appeared. Northrup is our protagonist in the film I should have thought this memoir would have been dynamite in its day.  It should have blown the roof from every complacent home in the land as well as give the vultures in Hollywood a wonderful opportunity to hear sounds of Cha-ching in their heads! I can but wonder why that didn't happen until now!  Without noticeable protest a free, learned, musically talented and well respected black man from upstate New York is somehow sold into slavery after accepting a two week stint as a musician in Washington D.C..  We never witness how or are privy to why this occurred and we never see the reaction of his wife, family or community.  What we do witness is the total humiliation, degradation and the foul, graphic and grave bodily mutilation meted out by the second of two of the new slave's master.  This man seems to believe it his divine right to remove the flesh from a person's body for any perceived infraction. If his first owner could be considered somewhat of a Christian like man, this second and last owner is one from the absolute pits of hell who never even saw the outside of a church never mind owned a Bible!  I have come away from this film having many more questions than answers and not especially empathetic to any of the people depicted here. I expected to come away feeling some degree of disgust and anger toward this country and my fellow white man but that hasn't happened.  If I feel any animosity toward my fellow man it is disgust of the highest order for subjecting anyone to this degree of mindless and endless torture without reason and without the slightest character development or discernible story line.  I have no idea why or how this picture was made.  It didn't educate or enlighten in the least and it certainly didn't entertain or make me feel as though I had just seen a film of import. I bought this film not knowing anyone who had seen it nor did I know anything about it other than the images the title conjured up in my mind. I had seen every important film or series dedicated to the issues of slavery and the plight of the African, colored, negro and black person in America. I have long felt that people have returned to classic film because there really are not very many important films made anymore.  Nor are there actors one is champing at the bit to see in a role. When I was younger it didn't matter what the film was...if a certain star was in it or a gifted director was a part of that project you'd see it without prior recommendation...and it was always good or great! And people talked about the films they had seen...not any more.  In any given year there were always movies that were great and you couldn't wait for Oscar time so you could be a part of it all. I can remember very, very tight races for the top honors in several years during that time. Today people tune it to see who is wearing what on the red carpet!  Young people are turning to classic film by the thousands and there is are several reasons for it. You used to be able to go and see or purchase a film based on who wrote, directed or acted in it and be happy you did.  Even if you were bedridden for a year and couldn't get out to see a film the Academy Awards was the indicator of what was worthwhile...but, not anymore!  If this was the best 2013 offered then I'd hate to see the rest of the nominees. The acting was well done especially by the primary players but I believe John Ridley, who adapted and wrote the screenplay, and Steve McQueen, the director of  this film, missed the point entirely. I'm still wondering how Alfre Woodard got to be the grand duchess who sat on a porch on a sunny afternoon or evening, seemingly holding court with several slaves in attendance as she crooked her pinky while drinking a cup of tea and spouting some sort of strange wisdom concerning life!  Yes...acting can be very good and even great...but if one has no idea of why the character exists or how they do...then it is all for nothing.

I didn't HATE the movie, as a one star indicates, but i certainly didn't enjoy it.I really wanted to watch this because with the media hype and the awards, I honestly thought it would be worth watching. But the story was so disjointed it was almost as hard for me to follow it as it was for my 88 year old mother, who watched it with me. It was a very long movie, by Hollywood standards, and yet with all that length, there was a surprising lack of character development. Such a serious lack that after watching it, I still don't really feel any connection with Solomon Northrop (the main character), still don't know anything about his family (except that the wife apparently sat around for 12 years assuming her husband was on an extended trip to the market or something), and don't have any clue how deep the connection ran between Solomon and the female slave, Patsy.Here's what I know for certain. Hollywood wanted to earn brownie points doing a film about slavery, and denigrating the South and every white person (and a few black ones too) that lived in the South during the days of slavery. Yes, slavery was abhorrent, and yes, there were a lot of evil slave owners. And I'm sure that there were some black slaves who played the system and married their master so they could rise above their station in life (speaking of Alfre Woodard's character). But it's almost as if Hollywood legendary directors/producers (Steve McQueen and Brad Pitt) thought that if they used the &#34;n&#34; word often enough, they could call it good historical film making and draw in the box office numbers. And I suppose it worked, given the awards and accolades it has received. But what a farce. It came off feeling more like a political statement than a historical film, and I feel that Hollywood exploited, once again, the man named Solomon Northrop.",2,Not Impressed.,1394150400,"03 7, 2014",2014,1932,"[""'m"", 'being', 'generous', 'giving', 'two', 'stars', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'give', 'only', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'HATE', 'movie', 'one', 'star', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'it.I', 'really', 'wanted', 'watch', 'media', 'hype', 'awards', 'honestly', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'worth', 'watching', 'story', 'was', 'so', 'disjointed', 'was', 'almost', 'hard', 'follow', 'was', '88', 'year', 'old', 'mother', 'who', 'watched', 'was', 'very', 'long', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'standards', 'yet', 'length', 'was', 'surprising', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'serious', 'lack', 'watching', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'connection', 'Solomon', 'Northrop', 'main', 'character', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'family', 'wife', 'apparently', 'sat', '12', 'years', 'assuming', 'husband', 'was', 'extended', 'trip', 'market', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'how', 'deep', 'connection', 'ran', 'Solomon', 'female', 'slave', 'Patsy.Here', 'what', 'know', 'certain', 'Hollywood', 'wanted', 'earn', 'brownie', 'points', 'doing', 'film', 'slavery', 'denigrating', 'South', 'white', 'person', 'few', 'black', 'ones', 'too', 'lived', 'South', 'days', 'slavery', 'Yes', 'slavery', 'was', 'abhorrent', 'yes', 'were', 'lot', 'evil', 'slave', 'owners', ""'m"", 'sure', 'were', 'black', 'slaves', 'who', 'played', 'system', 'married', 'master', 'could', 'rise', 'station', 'life', 'speaking', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'character', 'almost', 'Hollywood', 'legendary', 'directors/producers', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'thought', 'used', '34', '34', 'word', 'often', 'enough', 'could', 'call', 'good', 'historical', 'film', 'making', 'draw', 'box', 'office', 'numbers', 'suppose', 'worked', 'given', 'awards', 'accolades', 'received', 'what', 'farce', 'came', 'off', 'feeling', 'more', 'political', 'statement', 'historical', 'film', 'feel', 'Hollywood', 'exploited', 'once', 'again', 'man', 'named', 'Solomon', 'Northrop']",12 Years a Slave
1676599,A3N95R1VKWROWF,B00G4Q3KOC,Christopher Schwinger,"[14, 26]","Sometimes movies need to be made to awaken people's sense of justice.  12 Years a Slave has a similar role in doing that to Schindler's List, other than that Schindler's List also was about the power of one individual to make a difference.  12 Years a Slave is very, very realistic in presenting the life of slaves, but is equally conscientious about not being overindulgent in it.  The director, Steve McQueen (no relation to the 1960s actor), was discreet (tried to neither underdo nor overdo) with depicting the naked humiliation and floggings, didn't explicitly show the sexual molestation by a cruel master of a young slave woman, and often chose to show disturbing things from some distance and without total clarity.  Close-ups of brutality were done with the minimum of gore necessary to depict the reality.  Sadly, many people today believe slavery was only a side issue in the Civil War, and I hope and pray this film will wake people up to the historical reality.  If we wish to avoid future catastrophes like the Civil War and World War II, we need to be very careful to not allow our societies to get used to cruelty like was done to slaves and to Jews.  The three moral flaws of both the southern slaveholding system and the Nazi Third Reich were their racism, their overemphasis on submission to authority without regarding themselves as accountable to God for how they treated those under them, and their hierarchical system which had no accountability.  The slaveholder was accountable to no one, nor was Hitler.  I hope that this film helps more people realize that any government without an accountability system is a recipe for disaster, and that they will be more active in grassroots activism for that reason.Just before seeing 12 Years a Slave, I saw the new movie All Is Lost that has Robert Redford trying to survive alone at sea.  I mention All Is Lost to make the point that 12 Years a Slave gets its strong sense of justice from its acknowledgment that there is a God of justice.  In both movies, the character is trapped and without any reasonable hope, though he keeps trying to escape his predicament.  I think this one's a lot better.  All Is Lost was about self-reliance against the forces of nature, and really nothing more.  God was either distant or nonexistent, and the movie ended without any acknowledgment that the last-minute rescue was God's intervention.  12 Years a Slave insists that there is a God of justice and that He will ultimately not allow this system of brutal slavery to continue.  It serves as a reminder of a horrible past, but is made even more timeless because it places the focus of the moral struggle on who God is.  The slaveowner believes God is all about subservience.  The slave believes God is about kindness and supporting the cause of those who are cruelly persecuted.  There is some good discussion toward the end about God's justice in Brad Pitt's small but memorable role.  The movie could have used a bit more, but what it has is sufficient.  Pitt's character helps our hero, Solomon Northup, regain his freedom.  Brad Pitt was a producer for the film.The acting is excellent in the movie.  The script has dialogue that I can believe would have really been used, and usually comes off sounding like it's authentic instead of like a theatrical performance, which is good.  The movie does very well stylistically at presenting the atmosphere in a realistic but also beautiful way.  It was filmed in Louisiana and has carefully conceived outdoor shots, realistically lit interior shots that still feel artistic, and a stunning reminder of the disgusting contrast between the plantation mansion and the outdoor hard work of the slave.  It made me realize, even more than I already did, how much simpler it would be if the slaveholders just treated their slaves with respect, paid them well, let them work for whomever they chose, and let them climb the ladder through hard work.  Instead, it's a daily power play, an internal struggle within the overseer and master as to how much torture the slave should get, and a constant fear that the slave will rebel.If anyone thinks he/she could handle watching two pretty brutal flogging scenes, three scenes of discreetly presented naked humiliation, and human relationships between slave and master that are harshly realistic, I recommend this.  It's not something you ""must"" see if you don't have the stomach for it.  But it's a monumental movie and probably will become the best movie showing the reality of slave life.  It goes neither too light nor too heavy in depicting the reality, in my estimation, and will hopefully make many people more attuned to justice and willing to fight against injustice.",5,"The next ""Schindler's List""",1383609600,"11 5, 2013",2013,4718,"['Sometimes', 'movies', 'need', 'be', 'made', 'awaken', 'people', 'sense', 'justice', '12', 'Slave', 'similar', 'role', 'doing', 'Schindler', 'List', 'other', 'Schindler', 'List', 'also', 'was', 'power', 'one', 'individual', 'make', 'difference', '12', 'Slave', 'very', 'very', 'realistic', 'presenting', 'life', 'slaves', 'equally', 'conscientious', 'not', 'being', 'overindulgent', 'director', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'relation', '1960s', 'actor', 'was', 'discreet', 'tried', 'underdo', 'overdo', 'depicting', 'naked', 'humiliation', 'floggings', 'did', ""n't"", 'explicitly', 'show', 'sexual', 'molestation', 'cruel', 'master', 'young', 'slave', 'woman', 'often', 'chose', 'show', 'disturbing', 'things', 'distance', 'total', 'clarity', 'Close-ups', 'brutality', 'were', 'done', 'minimum', 'gore', 'necessary', 'depict', 'reality', 'Sadly', 'many', 'people', 'today', 'believe', 'slavery', 'was', 'only', 'side', 'issue', 'Civil', 'War', 'hope', 'pray', 'film', 'will', 'wake', 'people', 'up', 'historical', 'reality', 'wish', 'avoid', 'future', 'catastrophes', 'Civil', 'War', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'need', 'be', 'very', 'careful', 'not', 'allow', 'societies', 'get', 'used', 'cruelty', 'was', 'done', 'slaves', 'Jews', 'three', 'moral', 'flaws', 'southern', 'slaveholding', 'system', 'Nazi', 'Third', 'Reich', 'were', 'racism', 'overemphasis', 'submission', 'authority', 'regarding', 'accountable', 'God', 'how', 'treated', 'hierarchical', 'system', 'had', 'accountability', 'slaveholder', 'was', 'accountable', 'one', 'was', 'Hitler', 'hope', 'film', 'more', 'people', 'realize', 'government', 'accountability', 'system', 'recipe', 'disaster', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'active', 'grassroots', 'activism', 'reason.Just', 'seeing', '12', 'Years', 'Slave', 'saw', 'new', 'movie', 'Lost', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'trying', 'survive', 'alone', 'sea', 'mention', 'Lost', 'make', 'point', '12', 'Years', 'Slave', 'strong', 'sense', 'justice', 'acknowledgment', 'God', 'justice', 'movies', 'character', 'trapped', 'reasonable', 'hope', 'trying', 'escape', 'predicament', 'think', 'one', 'lot', 'better', 'Lost', 'was', 'self-reliance', 'forces', 'nature', 'really', 'nothing', 'more', 'God', 'was', 'distant', 'nonexistent', 'movie', 'ended', 'acknowledgment', 'last-minute', 'rescue', 'was', 'God', 'intervention', '12', 'Slave', 'insists', 'God', 'justice', 'will', 'ultimately', 'not', 'allow', 'system', 'brutal', 'slavery', 'continue', 'reminder', 'horrible', 'past', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'timeless', 'focus', 'moral', 'struggle', 'who', 'God', 'slaveowner', 'God', 'subservience', 'slave', 'God', 'kindness', 'supporting', 'cause', 'who', 'are', 'cruelly', 'persecuted', 'good', 'discussion', 'end', 'God', 'justice', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'small', 'memorable', 'role', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'bit', 'more', 'what', 'sufficient', 'Pitt', 'character', 'hero', 'Solomon', 'Northup', 'regain', 'freedom', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'was', 'producer', 'film.The', 'acting', 'excellent', 'movie', 'script', 'dialogue', 'can', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'used', 'usually', 'off', 'sounding', 'authentic', 'instead', 'theatrical', 'performance', 'good', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'stylistically', 'presenting', 'atmosphere', 'realistic', 'also', 'beautiful', 'way', 'was', 'filmed', 'Louisiana', 'carefully', 'conceived', 'outdoor', 'shots', 'realistically', 'lit', 'interior', 'shots', 'still', 'feel', 'artistic', 'stunning', 'reminder', 'disgusting', 'contrast', 'plantation', 'mansion', 'outdoor', 'hard', 'work', 'slave', 'made', 'realize', 'even', 'more', 'already', 'did', 'how', 'much', 'simpler', 'would', 'be', 'slaveholders', 'just', 'treated', 'slaves', 'respect', 'paid', 'well', 'let', 'work', 'whomever', 'chose', 'let', 'climb', 'ladder', 'hard', 'work', 'Instead', 'daily', 'power', 'play', 'internal', 'struggle', 'overseer', 'master', 'how', 'much', 'torture', 'slave', 'should', 'get', 'constant', 'fear', 'slave', 'will', 'rebel.If', 'anyone', 'he/she', 'could', 'handle', 'watching', 'two', 'pretty', 'brutal', 'flogging', 'scenes', 'three', 'scenes', 'discreetly', 'presented', 'naked', 'humiliation', 'human', 'relationships', 'slave', 'master', 'are', 'harshly', 'realistic', 'recommend', 'not', 'something', 'must', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'stomach', 'monumental', 'movie', 'probably', 'will', 'become', 'best', 'movie', 'showing', 'reality', 'slave', 'life', 'too', 'light', 'too', 'heavy', 'depicting', 'reality', 'estimation', 'will', 'hopefully', 'make', 'many', 'people', 'more', 'attuned', 'justice', 'willing', 'fight', 'injustice']",12 Years a Slave

Thrown from abusive master to abusive master, small meal portions, tight living quarters, and if you're able to read and write you're beaten for it. You have no friends, are packed like sardines in a can whenever you're transported, and the struggle to survive nearly outweighs the urge to live. Solomon's story is absorbing because his time as a free man is spliced into the film whenever he seems to drift off into his own world while he's a slave. His family and time as a free man are his comfort thoughts when he's not able to handle the harsh world around him.The historical drama is immediately uncomfortable and difficult to watch as it takes little time before Solomon gets his first beating and it's just the tip of the iceberg as far as excruciating sequences go. The cast is extraordinary as you see extremely familiar faces pop up here and there; Benedict Cumberbatch as a Baptist preacher and slave owner, Paul Giamatti as a man in charge of selling slaves and getting the best price for them, and Brad Pitt as a Canadian carpenter with an Amish beard. Paul Dano continues his streak of impeccable performances. Dano's portrayal of sleaziness and smarmy characters reaches new heights in ""12 Years a Slave."" He is extremely unsettling in the film.The two standouts of the supporting cast are Lupita Nyong'o as Patsey and Michael Fassbender as Edwin Epps. Patsey picks the most cotton out on the field every day and Master Epps (Fassbender) takes a liking to her because of it. Nyong'o's suffering bleeds through in her performance in every gesture and facial expression. Patsey's journey is heartbreaking and you feel it deep within your soul. Her whip lashing later on in the film is powerful, agonizing, and nearly unbearable to watch without flinching. Fassbender has this demanding yet frightening presence on screen. Epps is a drunk with a short-temper and treats his slaves like property. He is physically and sexually abusive and just the devil reincarnated as far as slave owners go.But of course the real gem of the film is Chiwetel Ejiofor. The English actor has so much talent and has been in several recognizable projects already, but the down side is nobody knows who he is. He will be a mainstay in the public eye after ""12 Years a Slave."" Ejiofor is an absolute beast in the film. If you weren't already sitting down, Ejiofor's performance would bring you to your knees because it's so devastating. The extended shots in the film, those ones that seem to last forever while everyone pretends not to see the disgusting event taking place right before them, will haunt you. The over the shoulder shots of kids playing in the background while someone is hanged. It's depressingly mesmerizing. Thinking on your toes has never meant more than during this film.""12 Years a Slave"" is a soul crushing experience. It's a film featuring no humanity and no kindness only damnation and desperation. You won't be the same after viewing it. It's as if a piece of you is left behind once it's over. ""12 Years a Slave"" strips you naked, verbally abuses you, puts you in restraints, and whips you bloody until you're so battered and beaten you think you're going to die. Then it ties a noose around your neck and hangs you out to dry. As you choke and gasp for air and begin to turn blue, the ropes loosen slowly. A small glimmer of hope emerges and you can breathe again. You will live to see another day, but your life will forever be changed because of it.""12 Years a Slave"" will leave you broken and it's difficult to imagine a repeat viewing, but it's also the most respectable and melancholy experience you'll have this year.

1676626,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B00G4Q3KOC,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[0, 3]","Director Steve McQueen (no relation to the actor) has made a name for his personal, bold themes (Shame) and has come of age with his latest, most affecting film, 12 Years a Slave, adapted by John Ridley from the novel by Solomon Northrop.  Perhaps no major studio film has portrayed slavery in America so honestly and directly.Solomon Northrop (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a free man in New York in 1841 with a wife and two children.  He is educated and blessed with a talent for playing the violin.  A tempting offer of work leads him to Washington D.C. where two white men trick him into being mistaken for a slave.  Helpless and unable to communicate with his family or anyone who can help him, Solomon is pulled into the world of torture and servitude as a slave to be auctioned as a commodity in the South.  Northrop is witness to inhumanity by white slave owners as families are torn apart.  He is sold from one plantation to another and finds one owner, Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender, a standout), who is not only strong willed but cruel and immoral.  Time goes by, and he always maintains a sense of dignity and hope while exhibiting compassion for his brethren.  Northrop&#8217;s desperate attempts to escape or get a letter to his family need the sympathetic ear of a good Samaritan for his salvation.Imagine being held against your will and performing menial, backbreaking work at the behest of cruel masters who strike out with deadly violence at the drop of a hat.  Now imagine that as an educated slave, he dares not reveal his intelligence lest he be executed.  Silence means survival.  Rebellion is met with severe punishment and death.  All this goes on year after year with little or no hope.That it took this long in cinema history to depict this stain of human intolerance is sobering especially in the post-Roots generation.  McQueen depicts the horrors of oppression and outright sadism while getting the details such as the frightened reactions of slaves to mere sounds.  He also has a firm sense of time and place with striking visuals.  Cinematography is excellent, and the period recreation is authentically convincing with historic set design and costumes as well as the flavor of music.  The film is similar to the lean narrative of Clint Eastwood&#8217;s recent films without the emotional pathos of Steven Spielberg.Ejiofor (Salt) has the best role of his career, and aside from the always impressive Fassbender (Prometheus), the surprise performance has to be Lupita Nyong&#8217;o as perhaps the most tragic of slaves.  Benedict Cumberbatch (perhaps the busiest actor currently) has an effective role of a sympathetic slave owner.  In an interesting bit role, Saturday Night Live&#8217;s Taran Killam shows a brief glimpse of dramatic potential.  There are several name actors who take supporting or bit roles including Paul Giamatti, Paul Dano, and Alfre Woodard.  Brad Pitt has a brief but significant moment that is a turning point in the story.

1676633,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B00G4Q3KOC,DanD,"[1, 2]","Based on the tragic true story, 12 YEARS A SLAVE follows freeman Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who gets kidnapped and taken south.  He first winds up in the service of a comparatively benevolent owner, before winding up with the cruel and troubled Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender).  The film chronicles Northup's resistance against his chains, this his acceptance, and subsequent struggle to reattain his freedom.Director Steve McQueen has given us some brutally honest films in the past; both HUNGER and SHAME are extremely hard to watch at times.  So it's surprising that SLAVE isn't quite as brutal.  Oh, don't get me wrong: McQueen and company don't shy away.  And neither, at times, does the camera.  But over everything, there's a certain gloss that just screams &#34;Oscar!&#34;  It isn't very loud (note the four stars), but it's there.That aside...what holds this film together is the integrity of its script, the cinematography (as awful as it may sound, this is truly a beautiful film), and the caliber of its performances.  Elijiofor's performance will come as no shock to those who've followed his career; he anchors this two-hour character study, nailing every nuance.  What comes as a pleasant surprise is the caliber of acting from the supporting parts.  Fassbender gives his character genuine depth; the most appalling thing about Epps is his humanity.  Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Giamatti, Paul Dano, Garret Dillahunt...even producer Brad Pitt gets in on the action for a couple scenes.  Yet, aside from Fassbender, it's newcomer Lupita Nyong'o who gets the spotlight (and Oscar) as the oft-abused slave Patsey.  Her role is small, but it does stand out from a superfluous cast of people wanting to get in on the action.I can't go so far as to say we haven't seen a film like this before.  But what I can say is, 12 YEARS THE SLAVE is a relatively unflinching look at a dark part of American history (and also the world's present, though few people seem to be addressing that).  There's a good bit of pandering going on here, but at the heart is an honest film that aims to tell the unveiled truth.

Brown,"[18, 30]","When the Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776 with the stirring words &#34;All men are created equal&#34;, 700,000 residents of our newly created nation were enslaved in all thirteen colonies, some owned by the writers of the words themselves. By the beginning of the Civil War, four million men, women and children suffered in bondage. The word &#34;Suffered&#34; is used deliberately because white Americans, no matter how sensitive, do not have a full grasp on just how brutal, inhuman and sheer evil, slavery in America was.&#34;12 Years a Slave&#34;, (Steve McQueen director) based on the true story of Solomon Northup, is a big step in redressing this omission as it shows the daily cruelties of life on a slave plantation in 1840's Louisiana. Northup lived as a free man with a family in Saratoga, NY when he was conned into a trip to Washington D.C. (where slavery was legal) and sold down into the Deep South. The story is essentially one of a proud man retaining his dignity and his sanity against inconceivable odds. The acting is impeccable with special notice going to Chiwetel Ejiofor as Northup, Michael Fassbender as his insanely complex master, Epps; and newcomer Lupita Nyong'o as Epps&#8217;s mistress, Patsey, whose suffering is even more tragic than Northup's&#34;12 Years a Slave&#34; is no &#34;Roots&#34;. Despite the poster image, there are no dramatic escape scenes with baying hounds and hideouts in the bayous. Solomon does not escape; he endures. And what makes his tale so horrific is how casual is the brutality; the floggings and rapes on one extreme, the ugly racist ditties sung by the overseers to serenade those working in the fields on the other. All proceed as normally as any daily routine.Nowadays, it is difficult to conceive that once in our history, half the population of the United States justified slavery as a beneficial institution, defended by Scripture, good for the booming economy and a boon to the slaves themselves. Even today, if you visit some of the &#34;Plantation Museums&#34; below the Mason-Dixon Line, you will find postcards in the gift shop depicting well-dressed and smiling African-American slaves. What you won't see there but will find in this remarkable film are the viciously scarred backs of the whipped, the screaming agony of mothers being ripped from their children; the slumped shoulders of servile submission.This is a hard movie to watch. It is also a necessity if only to understand why African-Americans might occasionally cast a jaundiced eye on their white neighbors. We've either forgotten, glossed over and denied their history.

All too often you these kinds of stories have a predictable ending.The main actor, Chiwetel Ejiofor, is extraordinary in this film and in my opinion he was robbed of the Golden Globe for best dramatic actor. Not to take anything away from Matthew McConaughey for his win for Dallas Buyers Club since I haven't see it personally, but this was one of the best acting performances in the past decade.

He is tricked into being kidnapped, and then is chained, beaten, broken down, re-named (now called ""Platt""), transported and sold into slavery in Louisiana. Northrup is one of the very few people to have escaped this terrible plight and, eventually, return to his home and family.This story is primarily about those 12 years a slave from the book Northup later wrote detailing the transition from free man to slave, the shocking living conditions and treatment of slaves in the south, and his own ordeal in the hands of three slave owners within a system of institutionalized captivity and abuse. His account provides a rare and incredible historic insight. The film is gritty, raw, real and details exactly how slavery ""worked"" in this country, including the many lines of defense to prevent escape, the extreme measures to deny freedoms, the ways slaves survived and did not, and the ill effects on  the people committing or allowing such atrocities.Torture and violence are set against an often beautiful scenic background, a physical example of the many contrasts presented in this film. The characters are complex and many insights into that time in history are revealed as well as eternal truths about human nature, cruelty and kindness, survival and courage. In this beautifully shot, masterfully crafted film, the main actor Chiwetel Ejiofor makes you desperately feel each and every emotion Solomon experiences from a carefree stroll with his wife and children in New York all the way through his horrific ordeal until his reunion with his family 12 years later.

1676682,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B00G4Q3KOC,Doug Anderson,"[8, 16]","McQueen was an art student before he became a filmmaker and while watching this film you can detect the influence of Brueghel and Goya (esp in the hanging sequence which is the most visually arresting of the entire film). And you can also detect the art school influence in the way he films groups of slaves standing still and looking straight into camera as if standing for a portrait. These moments are arresting and draw attention to the film as art object but also foreground the way faces in paintings seem to be looking at us, asking for compassion, asking not to be forgotten. But those art film flourishes aside this is not an art film, but in many ways an Old Hollywood drama with loads of Oscar appeal for three reasons. 1) McQueen is known for long takes and in this film the camera lingers on what it shows far longer than any other filmmaker has lingered on images of slavery especially of prolonged scenes of torture including lashings and rape. 2) McQueen digs much deeper into the psychologies of both the slaves and slavemasters than any previous filmmaker. Fassbender's performance is especially memorable. The role illustrates the depths of depravity (and soul-twisting rationalizations) required to participate in such a vile practice. His Edwin Epps is a man who cannot feel like a man unless he dominates others but the more he dominates (or tries to) the less of a man he becomes. Its a fascinating role and performance. Chiwetel Ejiofor's performance is equally memorable but in a completely different way. Fassbender's performance is manic and over the top and Ejiofor's is subdued, understated because that is the only way his Solomon Northup can survive his 12 year long ordeal. 3)  McQueen provides us with glimpes of a wide array of strategies employed by both slaves to endure and slave masters to justify this practice, this inhumane chapter in history. The most moving moment of the film is the moment the slaves all join together to sing &#34;Roll Jordan Roll&#34; while standing in a graveyard. In this moment they are no longer individuals (no individual can bear the burden they have been forced to bear alone) but a collective all leaning on each other and on God to see them through and to temporarily transform their pain and suffering into something beautiful, something life-affirming and soul-sustaining. But we also see other kinds of slaves who endured in other ways. One of the most memorable of these is played by Alfre Woodard who portrays a slave who uses her feminine wiles to become the wife of a slavemaster. Its a small role, just a few minutes of screen time, but its a few moments that remain etched in memory----this women has survived and will continue to survive only so long as she can veil her true self. And this performance is juxtaposed with Lupito Nyongo's even more memorable and movong performance as &#34;Patsey,&#34; a slave who cannot and will not veil her true self for anyone. Equally important (although less emotionally impactful) McQueen shows us that not all of the slaveowners were vile creatures like Epps but how even otherwise decent men owned slaves and justified this practice to themselves (at least one of the actors is quoted as saying he found these types to be even more vile than Epps because they knew better).

1676683,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B00G4Q3KOC,Doug Park,"[0, 0]","{4.5 stars}Directed by Steve McQueen and crew, this is definitely one of the very best films to come out in recent years. 12 YEARS A SLAVE is expertly filmed and gives an immediate recreation of the antebellum South. The acting by just about everyone is similarly outstanding, with special kudos going to Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northrup, Sara Paulson as Mistress Ebs, Lupita Nyong'o as Patsey, and Paul Dano as Tibeats. This film truly captures the barbarity of slavery in America and slavery in general: The empathy with its victims is disturbingly keen. Scenes such as that of the mother being separated from her young children at the auction are realistically heartrending. This film is also revealing of the Biblical justifications that slaveholders often used and the frequency with which female slaves were raped by plantation owners and overseers. At the same time, however, all of the characters are well-rounded. Without sugarcoating anything, 12 YEARS A SLAVE portrays even the cruelest of its subjects as eminently human and shows the varying degrees of humanity and inhumanity among slaveholders. Plenty happens, with a number of reversals and surprises, but, as in many intelligent dramas, there isn't any one defining climactic moment. There are one or two vague spots, and the sheer number of characters can be confusing.  There are also many of the  oversimplifications that we inevitably get in a two-hour film about a very complicated subject, e.g., it seems to suggest that the northern states, unlike the backwards slaveholding south, were completely non-racist and progressive in their thinking and practices, which was, of course, hardly the case. Regardless, while this story has been told before in a number of earlier films, it's still told very well here.As important as its subject may be, however, 12 YEARS A SLAVE is not just a film about slavery in America during the 1800s. It's about the will to power and the will to survive, human greed, human dignity, human guile and deception, and many other complications that occur between members of the human race. While it never stops to preach, the psychology of it all is powerful stuff, and there are characters in whom any modern person will find her/himself. As odd as this may sound, anyone who's ever worked at a job where they were treated disparagingly or been pressured to downplay their level of education and intelligence in order to avoid offending their ""superiors"" should immediately identify with the plights of Solomon Northrup and the other slave characters.Still, if you want to just watch it for the story and don't feel like analyzing its many themes, you may easily do so. 12 YEARS A SLAVE is just a very fine, perhaps even great, drama, the sort that can be watched again and again. If you enjoy this film, I might also recommend 1997'sAmistad.",5,"""I simply ask that you use all of your senses before rendering judgment""",1396915200,"04 8, 2014",2014,2847,"['4.5', 'stars', 'Directed', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'crew', 'definitely', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'films', 'come', 'out', 'recent', 'years', '12', 'YEARS', 'SLAVE', 'expertly', 'filmed', 'immediate', 'recreation', 'antebellum', 'South', 'acting', 'just', 'everyone', 'similarly', 'outstanding', 'special', 'kudos', 'going', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'Solomon', 'Northrup', 'Sara', 'Paulson', 'Mistress', 'Ebs', 'Lupita', 'Nyong', 'o', 'Patsey', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'Tibeats', 'film', 'truly', 'barbarity', 'slavery', 'America', 'slavery', 'general', 'empathy', 'victims', 'disturbingly', 'keen', 'Scenes', 'such', 'mother', 'being', 'separated', 'young', 'children', 'auction', 'are', 'realistically', 'heartrending', 'film', 'also', 'revealing', 'Biblical', 'justifications', 'slaveholders', 'often', 'used', 'frequency', 'female', 'slaves', 'were', 'raped', 'plantation', 'owners', 'overseers', 'same', 'time', 'however', 'characters', 'are', 'well-rounded', 'sugarcoating', 'anything', '12', 'YEARS', 'SLAVE', 'portrays', 'even', 'cruelest', 'subjects', 'eminently', 'human', 'varying', 'degrees', 'humanity', 'inhumanity', 'slaveholders', 'Plenty', 'number', 'reversals', 'surprises', 'many', 'intelligent', 'dramas', ""n't"", 'one', 'defining', 'climactic', 'moment', 'are', 'one', 'two', 'vague', 'spots', 'sheer', 'number', 'characters', 'can', 'be', 'confusing', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'oversimplifications', 'inevitably', 'get', 'two-hour', 'film', 'very', 'complicated', 'subject', 'e.g.', 'suggest', 'northern', 'states', 'backwards', 'slaveholding', 'south', 'were', 'completely', 'non-racist', 'progressive', 'thinking', 'practices', 'was', 'course', 'hardly', 'case', 'Regardless', 'story', 'been', 'told', 'number', 'earlier', 'films', 'still', 'told', 'very', 'well', 'here.As', 'important', 'subject', 'may', 'be', 'however', '12', 'YEARS', 'SLAVE', 'not', 'just', 'film', 'slavery', 'America', '1800s', 'will', 'power', 'will', 'survive', 'human', 'greed', 'human', 'dignity', 'human', 'guile', 'deception', 'many', 'other', 'complications', 'occur', 'members', 'human', 'race', 'never', 'preach', 'psychology', 'powerful', 'stuff', 'are', 'characters', 'whom', 'modern', 'person', 'will', 'find', 'her/himself', 'As', 'odd', 'may', 'sound', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'worked', 'job', 'where', 'were', 'treated', 'disparagingly', 'been', 'pressured', 'downplay', 'level', 'education', 'intelligence', 'order', 'avoid', 'offending', 'superiors', 'should', 'immediately', 'identify', 'plights', 'Solomon', 'Northrup', 'other', 'slave', 'characters.Still', 'want', 'just', 'watch', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'analyzing', 'many', 'themes', 'may', 'easily', 'do', 'so', '12', 'YEARS', 'SLAVE', 'just', 'very', 'fine', 'perhaps', 'even', 'great', 'drama', 'sort', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'again', 'again', 'enjoy', 'film', 'might', 'also', 'recommend', ""1997'sAmistad""]",12 Years a Slave

There are several harrowing sequences showing the ways in which the white masters exert their authority, especially at Edwin Epps' (Michael Fassbender's) plantation, where slaves and whites look on as Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o) is whipped for little or no reason.  In Steve McQueen's film, there is no such thing as a 'good' master: although Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) understands Solomon's (Chiwetel Ejofor's) suffering, he feels unable to intervene; as a slave, Solomon is part of a debt that Ford has had to pass on to Epps.  The one 'good' white, Bass (Brad Pitt) is not an American, but a Canadian immigrant and therefore 'untainted' by the whites' creed during the antebellum era.  The film is not without its questionable elements: one wonders whether a slave would be forced to whip a fellow-slave (most slave-owners had white overseers to undertake that task); and the issue of Solomon's release is perfunctorily handled (Bass delivers a letter which lleads to Solomon's release from servitude, despite Epps' justifiable objections.  Surely Epps, as the legal owner of Solomon/Platt, would have been able to challenge the decision in court.

The movie is based on the autobiography of Solomon Northrup, a free man kidnapped and sold into slavery during the early 1800&#8217;s. While the subject of slavery is a difficult one for Americans, this movie shines a spotlight on the effects of slavery on both the perpetrators and the victims. While much has been said about the physical violence depicted in the film (which by the way is definitely toned done from what happened in real life), I found the emotional and psychological impact having the greater effect on me personally.  Perhaps because I had read so much about the graphic depiction of the film&#8217;s violence, I was better prepared to watch it unfold on screen.  However, what I wasn&#8217;t really prepared for was the emotional impact of the film. Chiwetel Ejiofor eloquently conveys the main character&#8217;s emotional and psychological journey from free man to slave. His expressions and eyes make you feel the character&#8217;s despair and emotional struggle with what is happening to him.It&#8217;s sad to see similarities between Solomon Northrup&#8217;s era and our own.  The notion that an individual must always be in possession of &#8220;his free papers&#8221; demonstrating that he is a free person of color is eerily similar to current &#8220;show me your paper laws&#8221; meant to prove citizenship.  It reminds me of the quote &#8220;those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it.&#8221; The messages and paradoxes presented in the film leave you thinking; for example, the use of religion by the slave masters to justify enslaving human beings and the slaves reliance upon religion to help them cope and get through their enslavement. The move is so thought provoking.  It makes you wonder about the hypocrisy of those who try to revise history and pretend the Civil War wasn&#8217;t fought to end slavery.

To forgive for no...","[6, 10]","First, thank you Steve McQueen, John Ridley and Brad Pitt for directing, producing and creating the screen play for the novel ""12 Years a Slave"".Second, anyone who wants to know how utterly brutal most slavery was in the United States need only READ first-hand accounts of it which can be easily found in a local library, by doing a simple google search, or by viewing a thoughtful, accurate, and moving rendition of one of those `first-hand accounts'.  My opinion?  That perfect, brought to the big screen, first-hand account is ""12 Years a Slave"".Hands down, this is the best piece of work I have ever seen on American Slavery and, in my humble opinion, it tops the mini-series ""Roots"" which for many years has been the quintessential media authority on slavery in this country.  Yes, ""Roots"" spanned several generations and was pretty epic, but between the acting and how the story was told in ""12 Years A Slave"" it tops any other artsy or dramatic film that I've seen about being a slave in the American South.A note of caution:  this isn't ""Driving Miss Daisy"" or ""The Help"" - lol.  Though these last two movies mentioned discuss a period of America many decades after slavery ended, the point I'm trying to make by mentioning them is that ""12 Years a Slave"" isn't sugar-coated to be sweet, sappy or give you that warm, melodramatic, non-threatening feeling.  It is the truth and the truth can be a very hard and bitter pill to swallow.  I knew this movie would be difficult to watch, but I had no idea how difficult.  I wept throughout.The acting was superb by the entire cast and I hope there will be some Oscars received by the film, because it is deserved.There aren't enough stars in the sky to rate it.P.S.  After writing my review of ""12 Years a Slave"" on Amazon.com, I went back and started reading others' reviews and noticed that an excellent summation of this movie by another mentioned the film ""Schindler's List"" in his title as did I.

He was soon taken with other slaves by ship to New Orleans and sold into further slavery. He eventually came into contact with a Canadian abolitionist, who was able to notify his family of his whereabouts. In 1853, after the intervention of an official agent of the state of New York, he was freed. He filed charges against his kidnappers but after a long trial, the charges were dropped on legal technicalities and Northup was never compensated for his years in slavery. He orally related his story to a New York legislator, David Wilson, who published it in a book titled `12 Years A Slave.' The book was published less than a year after Northup's freedom and it sold over 30,000 copies. He is believed to have died in 1863. The original book was transformed into a screenplay by Ridley Scott for the cinematic version directed by Steve McQueen.The incredible true story of one man's fight for survival and freedom is disturbing to see and is a fine reminder of the horrors of man's inhumanity to man - slavery - that still exists today. In the pre-Civil War United States, Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free black man from upstate New York, is abducted and sold into slavery. Facing cruelty (personified by a malevolent slave owner, portrayed by Michael Fassbender), as well as unexpected kindnesses, Solomon struggles not only to stay alive, but to retain his dignity. In the twelfth year of his unforgettable odyssey, Solomon's chance meeting with a Canadian abolitionist (Brad Pitt) will forever alter his life. The significant polar roles between evil and good are well played by Benedict Cumberbatch, Liza j. Bennet, Sarah Paulson, Lupita Nyong'o, Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti, Alfre Woodard, Garret Dillahunt among a cast of thousands.The film is overly long, dwells on only the brutality to slaves, and fails to give us background on the most important characters - especially Solomon Northup. It is a very dark song, necessary to remand the world of the crime of slavery, but lacking in moments of light that allow the audience see the history clearly and to make the arc of the story more dramatic. Both Chiwetel Ejiofor (`I don't want to survive. I want to live') and Michael Fassbender are excellent. Grady Harp, March 14",4,`We need a sympathetic ear.

This movie isn't going to fill in the blanks (the book, on the other hand, is a different matter entirely).  The more I learn about both, the more I have to wonder if anything I was told about America, growing up, was true.  Slavery isn't merely a &#34;regrettable chapter&#34; in American history; it's a primary and integral aspect of our history and national character, and as such, a deformity every bit as unappealing to the eye as missing or deformed limbs, or a severely scarred face.  This movie doesn't tell you about slavery, it distills the brutality, and the cruelty, and the misery from the book, leaving all the history, information, and especially the subtle distinctions of the book aside, like some sort of chaff.  What you end up with is a beautiful cinematic ordeal, 2 hours or so of almost unending and near-pornographic violence.  A white viewer might allow that he needs to endure it to &#34;understand&#34;.  If that's your view, read the book.  Pretty much every white actor in the slave section of the film seems to have been cast because of the sharpness of his features, beady eyes, and his ability to hold a sneer.  Everyone, even the slaves, are little more than stick figures given one task, either to be brutally cruel, or to evince suffering.  You'd never know that Solomon Northrup said (if slavery were the only option, presumably) that if he had his family with him, he'd gladly have spent the rest of his life on Mr. Ford's plantation.  You'd never dream that Northrup's view of Slavery sounds today like that of a Berkeley liberal, when talking about slavery as an institution so utterly corrupting and deforming that the slave owners couldn't really be blamed for their cruelty, as the system itself made them cruel.  To illustrate this he gives the reader some incidents of white-on-white violence, including knife fights so nasty the combatants seem like animals.But not in this movie.This movie is almost 2 hours of inhuman cruelty and brutality, paired with suffering and misery.  The difference between Ford and the more dastardly slave owners is portrayed as slight at best.  The wives and kids are merely background props, and we get nothing of the background of the slaves---Northrup wasn't the only freeman kidnapped and sold into slavery, when he was taken in D.C.  You learn nothing of cotton cultivation and harvest, let alone cane cultivation and harvest.And nothing of course on the larger issues;  That Slavery existed as it did, and Jim Crow was as intense as it was, not because of some moral defect in the Southern makeup, but because the Southerner tends to express in public what most of us in the rest of the country would only mention cautiously, and then in the most private of circumstances, if then.  We may never use a racial epithet to describe black people as a group---&#34;such a southern trash tendency&#34; but in fact most northern whites saw the division of labor and wealth along race lines as perfectly natural, and never thought to question it, until forced to do so.  So what does it matter what words we use, or avoid?If you saw this movie, you really should read the book.  It won't be the ordeal you might expect, and you'll learn so much more even if your dismay about the nation's shortcomings is not abated by having done so.  If you haven't seen this ridiculous work, I suggest you skip it and read the book.  Other good works on the subject of slavery includes &#34;Black Cargoes&#34; by Mannix/Crowley, and an interesting parallel to &#34;12 Years A Slave&#34; is &#34;Skeletons On the Zahara&#34; about a Yankee ship looking for slaves that runs aground on the west coast of Africa, and it's mostly white crew is captured by bedouin tribesmen, stripped naked (clothes are valuable) and enslaved----if you think you've had a sunburn, you have no idea how bad it gets!  In other words, there are a lot of books out there that will bring you up to date on this horrible period in American history, without wasting your time on a film that puts all its eggs on a very violent cart that goes nowhere.",2,"Beautifully Filmed, Interesting Sound Track, But Mostly A Brutally Violent Cheap Entertainment.

However, I thought that this story would be more dynamic and reveal facets of slavery that have not been mentioned in previous films. I was sorely mistaken on both counts.The only facet of slavery that this film revealed is how this man became a slave. I won't spoil this revelation, you'll have to watch the film or have someone else tell you.Maybe I missed the scene or part of the scene, but I don't remember what explaination was given for why Northrup's family was leaving on a trip in one of the first scenes of this film.Flash backs were used obsessively throughout the film but it seemed that the interpretation of the flash backs were left up to the viewer.From the time that Northrup became a slave up until he was rescued from being a slave, the time that Northrup spent in slavery and the duration of his time spent at any given plantation was not mentioned. While the duration of Northrup's enslavement is the title of this film, how long he spent at any given location within the 12 years is indeterminable.The relationships between Northrup and other characters are not well explained. One such instance is when the &#34;Master&#34; asked Northrup's advice. For example, how did the master come to know that Northrup was anything other than a field slave?The majority of the characters were not well developed or well defined. In more than one instance Northrup had provoked the animus of a few of the characters. For the most part, there was no mention of what Northrup had done/said that led up to the animus.Perhaps the message that these situations might be interpreted is that these white men simply hated Northrup because of his color. This explaination appears to be as good any since the majority of these situations were not explained, either through dialog or by Northrup's interactions with the character(s).I wonder what an individual, who was not well versed in &#34;American&#34; slavery history, would think about this film.The absolute best result of buying this DVD is that taking my wife to see this film would have been more expensive than simply buying it.Bottom line, for me, watching this film was a struggle.

The acting was very good and the protagonist played by Chiwetel Ejiofor is exceptional in all matters concerned. The film lapses around the time where a decent man is kidnapped and sent to be a slave. It seems most African-Americans in those days were treated as slave. It is shocking to watch how their owners considered them their property and it was a done deal by everyone involved. I don't quite understand how this originated and the film doesn't talk of that but it simply begins with a good man's life going going to the worse most pitiable circumstances.A very intentional play by the director is that at no time he really blames race or even instigates such an institution of thought. He simply shows all sides to a possible story and asks not for justice but for the prevalence of common sense surrounding the very morals of freedom of a human being and the need for there to be equality in freedom.There are many powerful scenes. I was quite moved but somewhere I felt this film could have had more scenes involving a general biographical outline of sorts towards the beginning. It just puts you into the shoes of the day. While for some people, this lack of any PRIOR DESCRIPTION was very effective.Yet the strong point is that the film is entirely focussed on one individual's despair.

As time goes on, young people, if their middle school or high school doesn't go into greater detail as they grow older, they tend to forget or push to the back of their minds possibly the most heinous crime against humanity that this country has ever perpetrated. And when something comes along that does detail that era, it's shocking to discover. I'm hoping that when school teachers look to teach their older students about slavery, that director Steve McQueen's 12 YEARS A SLAVE is the film that they go to in order to illustrate what it was like in that era.The film follows the trials, hopes, defeats and victory of Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Eijofor, in a career-making performance), a free black man living happily and somewhat successfully with his wife and children in Saratoga, New York in the early 1840's. He is a man of great intelligence, kindness and talent, and it is this talent that two con artists exploit in order to kidnap Northup and send him south to Louisiana to be sold as a slave. Despite his protestations that he is indeed a free man, he learns quickly that the white people that have sold him into bondage care very little for that. He becomes the property of a decent-enough man named Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch), who appreciates that Solomon (now referred to as Platt) is more educated than he leads on to be, but due to a life-threatening scuffle between Solomon and one of Ford's underlings (Paul Dano), he is sold off to the brutal slave-owner Epps (Michael Fassbender) and his equally vicious wife (Sarah Paulson) where he spends the rest of his days as a slave, and forms a bond with Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o), another slave who is favored over all others by Epps because of his continued sexual abuse of her. Also met is Bass (Brad Pitt), a Canadian handyman who believes that slavery is a sin on America that will be visited upon the country's landscape in the future.This is a film unlike any other film I've seen about slavery because it doesn't shy away from the more brutal and terrifying moments that were prevalent in this time. Director McQueen does a marvelous job of showing the film almost entirely from Solomon's point of view. Since this film is indeed based on Northup's own memoirs, it would be deceitful to show alternating points of view. This is a world entirely seen through Northup's eyes, and writer John Ridley (THREE KINGS, U-TURN) adapts this as authentically as possible. There are many quiet moments where McQueen drops the excellent Hans Zimmer soundtrack to just ambient noise and lets the audience into moments that are reflective and horrific. As per usual with McQueen's films (like HUNGER and SHAME), his direction is artfully sparse. He avoids the traditional trappings to make an epic of this film and doesn't over-flourish the film with sweeping dramatic camera movements, but uses long single-takes to immerse you in this world, and in this man's life.The acting by all is superb, particularly by Eijofor, who has slowly been making a name for himself as a great supporting actor in films like SERENITY, SALT, KINKY BOOTS, and CHILDREN OF MEN. But this film truly gives him the opportunity to shine brightly, and it's a performance that is difficult to be topped this year. Similarly, newcomer Nyong'o crafts a performance that is often harrowing to watch and shows no ounce of fear in her performance. Fassbender (the star of McQueen's two previous films) is almost a human personification of the devil with his piercing eyes, outwardly handsome appearance, but his performance, while very strong, doesn't lend much to his character other than an eternally threatening presence since the film is told from Solomon's perspective, which again was the wisest way to go. Other performers like Cumberbatch, Paulson, Alfre Woodard, Paul Giamatti, and Garret Dillahunt aren't much more than cameos in some cases, but still leave a lasting impression.I know that other reviewers might be trying to downplay the importance of this film by stating that making a film about the evils of slavery is ""old hat"" or should be left in the past, because according to some of these people, a film like this only exists to make white people feel guilty. The irony of that attitude is not lost on my opening statement. I don't think that McQueen set out to make a film solely to make white people feel guilty about things that happened quite some time ago. I think that he made a film about an extraordinary man that overcame cruelty, degradation and despair to come out and make the country and indeed the world aware of what was happening and how it was . While I don't think that this film has the creative resonance of Alfonso Cuaron's GRAVITY or Spike Jonze's HER, 12 YEARS A SLAVE is an excellent and very important film that should be shown to successive generations so that this sin is not something that is repeated, and that, albeit in other countries or in other ways, this sin still exists to this day.",5,An immersive and detailed account

You will hear it many times during the awards season.Based on his book written in 1854, this best seller told how Solomon Northup, born a free (educated) black man in New York, was abducted in Washington DC, sold into slavery and his travails that followed. For one thing, he had to conceal his literacy or be killed. The screenplay is by John Ridley (""Red Tails""), with the much-acclaimed Steve McQueen (""Shame"") as director.We have always heard that power corrupts. I would argue that it's the ABUSE of power that is so corrosive, not the power itself. In my opinion, that is what is illustrated here.Look at the cast:* Chiwetel Ejiofor (""Salt"") is brilliant as Solomon Northup, the fellow whose misfortunes we must watch. This actor, born in England to Nigerian parents, is a terrific chameleon, a master of dialects, and a clever fellow who sang ""These Boots are Made for Walkin' "" as a fetching drag queen in ""Kinky Boots."" I'm a big fan.* Lupita Nyong'o (some TV) is Patsey, a fellow slave, subjected to every demeaning scheme her cruel owners can devise.* Quvenzhan&eacute; Wallis (""Beasts of the Southern Wild"") is Northup's daughter Margaret. Her name is pronounced ""Qua-ven-zhah-nay.""* Michael Fassbender (""Prometheus"") is excellent as Edwin Epps, a slave owner. He illustrates the dehumanizing effects that slavery has on both slaves and their owners. This German-born actor has worked non stop in America in both movies and television since he first appeared in 2001.* Sarah Paulson (Lots of TV) is his wife, who is every bit as cruel in her own sweet genteel way as her loathsome husband.This has a huge cast, and we see an interesting series of cameos which feature Brad Pitt, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Giamatti, Alfre Woodard, and Paul Dano, to name a few.This is 134 loooong R-rated minutes, with only two teeny scraps of humor, some nudity and far too many bloody whippings. I reached horror overload about halfway in: I saw enough lashings, beatings, hangings, rapes and humiliations to last me a lifetime.This movie is very capably done, both Fassbender and Ejiofor should be short-listed for Academy nominations, but the script itself was a bit of overkill. Sometimes too much brutality is just too much, the audience gets numb. Be warned....

Maybe assign more than one sentence conversations to the characters.

For a truer representation of the subject matter, see McQueen's own Hunger, which although avoiding the race-baiting and the American slavery history, succeeds in being a clarion for universal human rights.Let's hope that Mcqueen runs and doesn't walk to the nearest exit away from Brad Pitt and his production company.",2,Oscar Bait? ...Worse?,1386288000,"12 6, 2013",2013,1048,"['film', 'indeed', 'Schindler', 'List', 'slavery', 'positive', 'negative', 'be', 'judge', 'one', 'can', 'tell', 'star', 'rating', 'how', 'mean', 'it.I', 'was', 'so', 'so', 'disappointed', '12', 'Years', 'Slave', 'have', 'always', 'rooted', 'director', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'taking', 'important', 'issues', 'pitfall', 'possibly', 'awaited', 'making', 'film', 'succeeded', 'stepping', 'Self-important', 'self-righteous', 'steeped', 'modern-day', 'race', 'politics', 'lot', 'happened', 'now', 'when', 'slavery', 'occurred', 'making', 'film', 'strange', 'experience', 'giving', 'untruthful', 'ring', 'devolving', 'end', 'politically', 'correct', 'feel-good', 'fest', 'perhaps', 'projenitor', 'Schindler', 'List', 'little', 'TOO', 'closely', 'truer', 'representation', 'subject', 'matter', 'see', 'McQueen', 'own', 'Hunger', 'avoiding', 'race-baiting', 'American', 'slavery', 'history', 'being', 'clarion', 'universal', 'human', 'rights.Let', 'hope', 'Mcqueen', 'runs', ""n't"", 'walk', 'nearest', 'exit', 'away', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'production', 'company']",12 Years a Slave

Though there have been other arresting films on the travesties of slavery, somehow this one achieved a unique emotional response. Perhaps it was due to the fact that Solomon was an educated, prosperous musician in the north until he was tricked into a situation that resulted in him being sold into slavery. His name was changed to Platt, and in order to survive he had to pretend to be uneducated. Mostly, he kept his head down and said &#34;yassah&#34; and &#34;nosuh&#34; in order to avoid the censure of his volatile masters.The scenes in which he is lashed and humiliated are almost too much to bear. Every justification for slavery is trotted out and espoused by the white slave-holders, and each rings hollow and stupid. The slaves are made to strip naked, work in intolerable situations, be separated from their families, and dance at the beck and call of their masters. There's nothing new here in terms of exposing the inhumanities of slavery, but somehow the actors and settings provide a lasting impression that is unique.The DVD extras reveal that the film was shot in a mere 35 days, which is astonishing considering the variety of scenes. The settings in the deep south are sumptuous and sensuous, providing a surreal backdrop to the insensitivities to the treatment of the slaves.

But today is a day I will remember for quite awhile. Here is my review for the movie 12 Years A Slave.This movie introduces us to the historical figure Solomon Northup (played very memorably by Chiwetel Ejiofor). He is a well known player of the violin, and he is soon happened upon by two men who convince Solomon to join a circus to perform. Unfortunately, things go from bad to worse quickly and soon after, Solomon is a slave.12 Years A Slave does so many things right that you almost forget that it is a movie. Michael Fassbender has really outdone himself with this movie. His character Edwin Epps, is the definition of sadistic evil. Michael Fassbender acted the role so well, I had to remind myself several times he's just acting. It is sad to see how his character tries to justify his harsh treatment of ""his property"" with the bible, but thankful for the characters like Benedict Cumberbatch's(yes he is in this movie) character Mr. Ford that sees that these people are humans just like the rest of them.How great the story is would be a summary of how I feel about the movie which is one word: Miraculous. I can go on and on about how great the actors/actresses are in the movie, but the story and direction are just as great. And with that being said, I agree with every positive review that has been said on Amazon(and in general) about the movie 12 Years A slave. Because without a shadow of any doubt, 12 Years A Slave, be it that it is a heart breaking, depressing re-telling of slavery in America, succeeds as film of hardship and courage. The Oscar race has just gotten tougher and I would not be at all surprised to see this movie win multiple awards including Best Picture of the year.

This movie does one thing well: Pull at the heart strings. As for complexity of story there was very little. There seemed to me to be so much opportunity to feel the anxiety of the slaves, the fear they felt of the future when in troublesome situations, the hope and the bonds they felt, or the mourning of their numbed consciences and lost feelings due to witnessing and being the subjects of the dehumanizing effects of slavery. The actors were excellent all the way through, but they were all asked to play very simple one-dimensional roles, in my opinion, and I see that a very significant number of reviewers, even those who liked the movie like I did, shared this opinion that the actors were given very static roles to play. This movie is the kind of movie that I think is worth watching once and having a soul washing cry that makes you want to walk away thinking of love, and justice, and charity... but I don't think I need to revisit the scene over and over again. I think that the one time a year where we need to stare at such injustice of an innocent man being flogged and beaten, and pushed under the injustice of the world, we should do that on Good Friday when Jesus is hanging on the cross for the world's sins.

1676828,A2RYXCJ91AQPS9,B00G4Q3KOC,judy,"[0, 0]","It comes to no surprise for me that I liked the film. I knew I would enjoy it even before it was released it just seemed like that uplifting true take on slavery. The film, unlike many, did justice to the topic of slavery, not skipping on the dirty details that has been polished before in many, many film adaptions of the same topic of slavery. And then the film took 9 nominations at the Academy Award. Of course it only won two of those awards, it got what it deserved. While I still feel 'Gravity' was the better film, '12 Years a Slave' was a close second and here is why. My review of '12 Years a Slave'.'12 Years a Slave' follows Solomon Northup, a free man, kidnapped and forced into slavery under the name 'Platt' for 12 years, facing the hardships of being a slave, under the hands of a few different slave owners.The story of Solomon Northup is based on his biography written by himself and titled '12 years a Slave'. The film ended up being scripted brilliantly by 'John Ridley'. Ridley wrote all the details of slavery into his lengthy screenplay, and left nothing out. He faithfully adapted Northup's biography into a film script having taken all it had and putting it onto another piece of paper, adding little attachments. His script work was beautiful, yet sometimes flawed. By flawed, I mean that it isn't always clear as to the events occurring, sometimes ending up avoiding realistic situations in favor of instead moving onto another problem, never fully coming to light on a problem. For example, the fact that Northup, a slave, got away with beating a white man, with his own wipe, and not getting punished is beyond shocking to me, and then next thing you know he is being traded to Epps. His script was smart, but flawed. It never holds back, it is raw and compelling.The cast portrays the historical characters with realistic expressions and motions and, whatever. British man, 'Chiwetel Ejiofor' powerfully leads the cast as Solomon Northup. He pulls you into the story, he shows you pain; he shows you kindness, and hardships. He gave us the impact that we need. He emotionally connected with us; his character did, because of Ejiofor. Not to mention that Ejiofor perfectly masks his British voice, in a convincing American one. Another delight was the heartbreaking and tear jerking performance from newcomer, (and Academy Award Winner) 'Lupita Nyong'o'. Her situation and pain is felt, just as much a Northup's. And during the films most controversial and cringworthy scene at the end of the film, she holds her own, making you shoat for mercy the whole time. She fits the slave Patsey perfectly, and I couldn't imagine anybody better to play the role. 'Michael Fassbender' plays the worthless slave owner during most of the film's second and third acts. He makes every sound stop. Whenever he yells, your heart stops beating, because you know there's trouble. He plays the villain perfectly. The rest of the cast does well in their roles as well. There's just one guy I don't believe fit, and that was 'Paul Dano' as the second hand to the nice slave owner William Ford. He just seemed too young for the role, even if he acted solidly; it just wasn't convincing enough for me.The musical score is strange, it doesn't play often, but when it does it hits you. It sets you in the mind frame of what's happening, it undertones the lines. If there is violence, the music is heard playing to the beat of the cry of whoever is getting hurt. It's emotional, it's driving, and it's original. And of course it was done by 'Hans Zimmer'. It's gripping, powerful, and works with the scenes to hit you harder then you thought you'd be hit.Direction from 'Steve McQueen' was extraordinary. He knows how to helm a feature. He shocks you with affective camerawork. He gives you many shots of Ejiofor's face to express his emotions and expressions in reenactment to what is placed on him, and what he is thinking. And he uses his techniques to convey the suffering of the slaves. He never went and skimped, when he promised he would make an excellent retelling of Solomon Northup's tale. He knew what he wanted and went for it, directing an excellent feature.The editing was creative and effective. What you see is shots that are cut where you just linger in a particular area for a much longer period of time, letting you absorb what is occurring or what has occurred, or what will occur. It helps keep you invested in Northup's tale, and wanting more.All and all, '12 Years a Slave' is a powerful, raw, emotional, film that never goes limp on all the gory details of Northup's tale of survival. It succeeds in impacting you emotionally with the powerful performances, solid scriptwriting and creative camerawork, and will leave you thinking for moments after the films end.

General Patton wanted to film the German concentration camps because he felt at some point in the future there would be deniers. I've been to quite a few southern plantations and I find they mostly concentrate their message on the wonderful life of the tenants...minus the slaves that provided that life of luxury. There's lots of time spent on debutantes and finery but not much on beating the crap out of the un-hired help. This system can't quite be called deniers but it certainly likes to look the other way. I found one plantation that told the slave story in detail and oddly enough it also happens to be where I bought the book, 12 Years a Slave, many years ago.This is a well acted, filmed, and directed movie. It's moving, and frustrating and yet it ends on a high note. But the language and brutality is realistic and unflinching. It's visceral. It's rated R so I watched it first before letting my 7 year old anywhere near it (he's not ready yet). There's nudity but not gratuitous...which a lot of people say about movies but here I felt it was presented in such a way as to show you the chattel-like way the slaves were processed by the slave industry. It's very brief and doesn't linger. Then there's the violence...brutal realistic whipping and beatings. That may turn your stomach but that's kind of the point isn't it?

Be forewarned: the movie depicts the horrors and violence of slavery in graphic and unflinching honesty, so if you are watching this with age-appropriate youth you will want to spend some time discussing what they will they see first.The story is gripping and the acting is superb. There are many scenes that moved me to tears -- including Solomon Northrup's (masterfully acted by Chiwetel Ejiofor) realization that he has been duped by two White men into a life of slavery, and a heartbreaking scene where plantation slave Patsey (in a tour-de-force performance played by Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong'o) begs to be spared from punishment for leaving the plantation simply to procure a sliver of soap so she can wash the dirt and sweat of the cotton fields off her exhausted body.This movie showcases beautiful cinematography and is rich with complex characters who have both admirable and less-admirable qualities (the way I like it!), and it is unflinching in it's depiction of the horrors and violence of slavery (rightly so, in my opinion).

There is in my family history that my family owned two slaves. They were part of journal entries, diaries, and in written records of the time. However, the stories of my family's slave owning experience were quite opposite of what was portrayed in this movie. I do not, my family does not - even back to those generations - feel that slavery was an appropriate institution. In the case of our family, slavery was an institution that was enforced for everyone, white and black. When General Ewing issued General Order #10 requiring the emancipation of every slave, our folks divided the farm in half to share with their emancipated slaves; but, GO #10 also forbade blacks to remain in the State - they were forced to move on. So like many others, the folks provided the best wagons and equipment available and all the supplies on hand to facilitate their travel. It is described as a very emotional and difficult time by both families. What I'm trying to express is that no one was in control. In the movie, slaves were portrayed in the harshest imprisonment, treatment, and torture on an on-going basis. I'm sure all these things happened to some slaves at some times, but it is difficult to see how it could endure on a constant and on-going basis. Slavery for the white masters portrayed in the movie was a business and the slaves portrayed were livestock. It seems inconceivable that any business owner would torture, injure, starve and disable any beast they intended to profit from it's sale or labor. The story may be true, I wasn't there, but this story, as portrayed, strains credibility. My family folks back then, agonized over the many issues and actions of the time; slavery being but one atrocity among a hell-scape of atrocities during the time. Movies like this, have so little space to compress such overbearing subjects that everything in such a movie loses the context of the times - and locations - and people. I can say that my family may have once owned slaves; but I can say that according to their journals, diaries, passed-down stories from generation to generation, I've never read or heard of anything even approaching what was portrayed in this movie. But that doesn't mean it didn't happen, just that those kinds of things didn't happen in the world that my family folks lived in.  Slavery as an institution, aside from the tortures, the starvation, the isolation, the violations - slavery of one person owning another is a moral and ethical wrong. The treatment of any creature, human or animal, as shown in this movie is as abhorrent and intolerable as anything man has done to man at anytime in the history of the world.

It affected me that much. I am still thinking about it. There was a lot of back and forth motion in Solomon Northup's memories so actually, the second time made it even more clearer to me. I was horrified and my heart just broke in so many places. The scene where he is tip-toing on the noose in the slippery mud struggling to stay alive as the day turned into evening will be forever emblazed on my mind. I think I was screaming, &#34;For God's sakes, somebody help him!&#34; You keep wondering through it all, just what is he going to do to escape his fate, because you know he does. The seasons change, the years go by, the house is built when he confides to the Canadian carpenter (Brad Pitt) about his circumstances and you just silently watch as does Northup.This is an interesting movie for basically it just shows Solomon Northup as an observer about his life and about slavery. There is not a lot of dialogue about what he says or feels, but the emotion on his face and how he changed from a very satisfied and content free man with his loving family in the mainstream of society to the ultimate shattering of his soul of what he had endured as a bitter black slave with no rights or free will of any kind. It was so realistic, and you feel such a sense of loss that when he does get rescued, Patsy (who won the best supporting actress) is left behind and you know there is nothing anyone can do about her wretched and long-suffering life.Kudos to the script writer for writing the language exactly how it was in those times. I have read books in that time period (Lincoln's biographies, etc.) and that was exactly how they spoke. He also won the Oscar for best screenplay. If you want to know how it was for slaves, I recommend seeing this movie. It will tear your heart out.Also, the first song sang, &#34;Run, N-----, Run&#34; by the overseer, my husband and I were just struck in our seats. We had found that video of that same song years ago when we were courting online and found it humorous at the time, I remember. I'm sorry for saying that, but my husband is a musician and likes to look back at old songs and so all those slave songs sung in the movie are bonafide songs that were sung by the black slaves. When we heard that cruel song, we just both started crying together and looked at each other in wonder. I still feel just ashamed that I laughed at that song. Lee later said that, &#34;I can't believe they used that song.&#34; The original video is sung by black slaves and you can find it on youtube.This movie represents why it's so important that people do write down their own stories and not just depend on some fictional or so-called expert writer who &#34;thinks they know what it's about&#34; when they don't. True stories tell the honest to God truth about it. I do hope Solomon Northup is smiling in heaven knowing that his words got out there even though it's been almost two centuries later and was made into a movie which wouldn't have even been imagined in his lifetime.The viewers now-days want to know what it is really like and it was obvious by the fact as the Academy Awards gave this movie an Oscar for Motion Picture of the year. There were many good contenders, but the true stories such as 12 Years a Slave, The Dallas Buyers Club and Captain Phillips were the ones that the audiences of the world are most interested in and believe because so often as we know, true stories are more fascinating than fiction. To really know and to really understand by those who have lived it, is what we are most intrigued by and it will only continue to be so.We don't always want a Hollywood movie that is glamourized and sewed up with a happy ending and all loose knots suddenly mysteriously solved. Tell us how it really is and we will like you more. And then let us form our own opinion as every person has the right to do so.Much applause for all the cast, the performers, the director and the producers of this very well-made historical movie which will be solid evidence for all descendants of their ancestors which were cruelly enslaved in this shameful time of our country although it will hurt them as it did me.Kelly CyrAuthor of &#34;Supreme Love: A Battered Woman's True Story&#34;",5,Harrowing First Account of Slavery,1394668800,"03 13, 2014",2014,4379,"['Kelly', 'CyrThis', 'review', '12', 'Years', 'Slave', 'DVD', 'watched', 'movie', 'twice', 'usually', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'read', 'movies', 'more', 'first', 'time', 'affected', 'much', 'am', 'still', 'thinking', 'was', 'lot', 'back', 'forth', 'motion', 'Solomon', 'Northup', 'memories', 'so', 'actually', 'second', 'time', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'clearer', 'was', 'horrified', 'heart', 'just', 'broke', 'so', 'many', 'places', 'scene', 'where', 'tip-toing', 'noose', 'slippery', 'mud', 'struggling', 'stay', 'alive', 'day', 'turned', 'evening', 'will', 'be', 'forever', 'emblazed', 'mind', 'think', 'was', 'screaming', '34', 'God', 'sakes', 'somebody', 'help', '34', 'keep', 'wondering', 'just', 'what', 'going', 'do', 'escape', 'fate', 'know', 'seasons', 'change', 'years', 'go', 'house', 'built', 'when', 'Canadian', 'carpenter', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'circumstances', 'just', 'silently', 'watch', 'Northup.This', 'interesting', 'movie', 'basically', 'just', 'Solomon', 'Northup', 'observer', 'life', 'slavery', 'not', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'what', 'feels', 'emotion', 'face', 'how', 'changed', 'very', 'satisfied', 'content', 'free', 'man', 'loving', 'family', 'mainstream', 'society', 'ultimate', 'shattering', 'soul', 'what', 'had', 'endured', 'bitter', 'black', 'slave', 'rights', 'free', 'will', 'kind', 'was', 'so', 'realistic', 'feel', 'sense', 'loss', 'when', 'get', 'rescued', 'Patsy', 'who', 'won', 'best', 'supporting', 'actress', 'left', 'know', 'nothing', 'anyone', 'can', 'do', 'wretched', 'long-suffering', 'life.Kudos', 'script', 'writer', 'writing', 'language', 'exactly', 'how', 'was', 'times', 'have', 'read', 'books', 'time', 'period', 'Lincoln', 'biographies', 'etc', 'was', 'exactly', 'how', 'spoke', 'also', 'won', 'Oscar', 'best', 'screenplay', 'want', 'know', 'how', 'was', 'slaves', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'movie', 'will', 'tear', 'heart', 'out.Also', 'first', 'song', 'sang', '34', 'Run', 'N', 'Run', '34', 'overseer', 'husband', 'were', 'just', 'struck', 'seats', 'had', 'found', 'video', 'same', 'song', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'were', 'courting', 'online', 'found', 'humorous', 'time', 'remember', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'saying', 'husband', 'musician', 'likes', 'look', 'back', 'old', 'songs', 'so', 'all', 'slave', 'songs', 'sung', 'movie', 'are', 'bonafide', 'songs', 'were', 'sung', 'black', 'slaves', 'When', 'heard', 'cruel', 'song', 'just', 'started', 'crying', 'together', 'looked', 'other', 'wonder', 'still', 'feel', 'just', 'ashamed', 'laughed', 'song', 'Lee', 'later', 'said', '34', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'used', 'song.', '34', 'original', 'video', 'sung', 'black', 'slaves', 'can', 'find', 'youtube.This', 'movie', 'why', 'so', 'important', 'people', 'do', 'write', 'down', 'own', 'stories', 'not', 'just', 'depend', 'fictional', 'so-called', 'expert', 'writer', 'who', '34', 'know', 'what', '34', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'True', 'stories', 'tell', 'honest', 'God', 'truth', 'do', 'hope', 'Solomon', 'Northup', 'smiling', 'heaven', 'knowing', 'words', 'got', 'there', 'even', 'been', 'almost', 'two', 'centuries', 'later', 'was', 'made', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'even', 'been', 'imagined', 'lifetime.The', 'viewers', 'now-days', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'really', 'like', 'was', 'obvious', 'fact', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'gave', 'movie', 'Oscar', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'year', 'were', 'many', 'good', 'contenders', 'true', 'stories', 'such', '12', 'Years', 'Slave', 'Dallas', 'Buyers', 'Club', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'were', 'ones', 'audiences', 'world', 'are', 'most', 'interested', 'believe', 'so', 'often', 'know', 'true', 'stories', 'are', 'more', 'fascinating', 'fiction', 'really', 'know', 'really', 'understand', 'who', 'have', 'lived', 'what', 'are', 'most', 'intrigued', 'will', 'only', 'continue', 'be', 'so.We', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'want', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'glamourized', 'sewed', 'up', 'happy', 'ending', 'loose', 'knots', 'suddenly', 'mysteriously', 'solved', 'Tell', 'how', 'really', 'will', 'like', 'more', 'then', 'let', 'form', 'own', 'opinion', 'person', 'right', 'do', 'so.Much', 'applause', 'cast', 'performers', 'director', 'producers', 'very', 'well-made', 'historical', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'solid', 'evidence', 'descendants', 'ancestors', 'were', 'cruelly', 'enslaved', 'shameful', 'time', 'country', 'will', 'hurt', 'did', 'me.Kelly', 'CyrAuthor', '34', 'Supreme', 'Love', 'Battered', 'Woman', 'True', 'Story', '34']",12 Years a Slave

All of us in this country have been impacted by it: it underscores much that we do or do not do, much that we say or do no say, much that we feel or believe we ought to feel. It is the blight that infects us all, though it also, as the film shows, and as James Baldwin and other writers manifest, can be the tale of resilience, human ingenuity, and love. !2 Years a Slave begins the process of showing slavery's horrors--you see the beatings, the misanthropy,  the day in and day out psychological warfare against African American people. It is difficult to watch, but slavery,  like the Holocaust, was horrific. We who live in slavery's shadow must see our past for what it is, for if we don't, we will continue to be mired in our present stasis: whites wondering why blacks are so angry; blacks wondering why whites are so naive. !2 Years a Salve is a beginning, a first step towards confronting the horror of slavery.

1676854,A2MUACY8VTQV31,B00G4Q3KOC,Kermit,"[0, 7]","12 Years A Slave is a film for white people. More specifically, white liberals. When I say that, I also mean that I firmly believe that no black person has any business watching the film. For the very reason I don't watch films about slavery: it is traumatic. Of course many black folks have watched the film, and maybe they came out no worse for wear, or think they did, but I am more inclined to think that this sort of psychological trauma, rooted in the Diaspora's beleaguered history in the United States, doesn't always surface on the level of consciousness. Beyond that, the film doesn't tell us anything that we didn't already know. That the institution of slavery was brutal, inhuman, and one of few things in this world that can be considered unequivocally, objectively, and absolutely evil.What does any black person stand to gain from sitting in a dark movie theater&#8212;more than likely surrounded by white people&#8212;and being psychologically assaulted for two hours? Will we then turn to those white audience members, or get together in groups with them later, and discuss how horrible it all was, how many tears they shed, and eventually breathe a collective sigh of relief that all that was in the past, and thank God that we've come so far?

1676861,A3LZBOBV9H1HDV,B00G4Q3KOC,"Kris King ""Kristopher""","[1, 2]","""12 Years A Slave"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: In the pre-Civil War United States, Solomon Northup, a free black man from upstate New York, is abducted and sold into slavery. Facing cruelty at the hands of a malevolent slave owner, as well as unexpected kindnesses, Solomon struggles not only to stay alive, but to retain his dignity. In the twelfth year of his unforgettable odyssey, Solomon's chance meeting with a Canadian abolitionist will forever alter his life.The cast led by Chiwetel Ejiofor (in a brilliantly, superb Oscar-nominated performance as Solomon), Michael Fassbender (equally brilliant in an unnerving and jarring (as well as Oscar-nominated) performance as Epps) & Lupita Nyong'o (in an emotionally-charged and brilliantly-crafted Oscar-winning performance as Patsey), alongside Benedict Cumberbatch (as Ford), Paul Dano (as Tibeats), Paul Giamatti (as Freeman), Sarah Paulson (as Mistress Epps), Alfre Woodward (as Mistress Shaw) & Brad Pitt (who was a producer, as well) (as Bass) is brilliant. The directing by Steve McQueen (who also was a producer) is brilliant. The screenplay (Oscar-winning) (based on Solomon Northup's novel) by John Ridley (who also was an executive producer) is brilliant.The music by Hans Zimmer is brilliant. The cinematography by Sean Bobbitt is brilliant. The (Oscar-nominated) film editing by Joe Walker is brilliant. The casting by Francine Maisler is brilliant. The (Oscar-nominated) production design by Adam Stockhausen is brilliant. The art direction by David Stein is brilliant. The (Oscar-nominated) set decoration by Alice Baker, set dressings by Kenneth Chauvin, Walter Dickerson, Zachary Dickerson, Greg Harney, Joie Todd Kerns, Michelle Lacayo, Kevin C. Lang, Erik Malkovich, Siobhan O'Brien, Alixandra Petrovich, Shelly Sanchez & Gordon Thomas, set designs by Matthew Gatlin, Walter Schneider, Carl Sprague & Jim Wallis is brilliant. The (Oscar-nominated) costume design by Patricia Norris is brilliant. The special effects coordinated by David Nash is brilliant. The visual effects coordinated by Elbert Irving IV & Katie McCall & supervised by Tim LeDoux & Dottie Starling is brilliant. The stunts coordinated by Andy Dylan, Lex D. Geddings & Steven Ritzi is brilliant.This is a brilliantly, well-made and well-crafted movie that is entertaining, at times, if unnerving and unflinching, considering the movie's subject matter. Steve McQueen, has to date, made one of his best pictures, if not, his best movie, of his career, thus far. Michael Fassbender also gives another well-crafted and unflinching performance in another one of Steve McQueen's films.

While many viewers have lamented the vivid brutality of the film - and indeed there are numerous lingering close-ups of the vicious carnage inflicted upon these poor people - the film is still an important examination of the various ways slaves suffered. From the emotional devastation of being relentlessly subjugated without a family to the ferocious physical torture, the film does an excellent job of studying the wages of these horrors upon a human soul. The filmmakers and actors strive to capture every nuance to the slave trade that many might not have know ever existed - from the mouth chains and sales parlors, to the sleeping arrangements and competitiveness for a master's favor.This is not a feel-good and joyful experience, but I think anybody who watches the film is only the better for it by a wiser understanding of this sad chapter in American history.",5,A touching but unflinching portrait of the evils of slavery,1393804800,"03 3, 2014",2014,1058,"['almost', 'people', 'are', 'familiar', 'overall', 'wrongness', 'slavery', ""'d"", 'wager', 'few', 'have', 'ever', 'encountered', 'graphic', 'depiction', 'what', 'unfortunate', 'era', 'actually', 'encompassed', 'many', 'viewers', 'have', 'lamented', 'vivid', 'brutality', 'film', 'indeed', 'are', 'numerous', 'lingering', 'close-ups', 'vicious', 'carnage', 'inflicted', 'poor', 'people', 'film', 'still', 'important', 'examination', 'various', 'ways', 'slaves', 'suffered', 'emotional', 'devastation', 'being', 'relentlessly', 'subjugated', 'family', 'ferocious', 'physical', 'torture', 'film', 'excellent', 'job', 'studying', 'wages', 'horrors', 'human', 'soul', 'filmmakers', 'actors', 'strive', 'capture', 'nuance', 'slave', 'trade', 'many', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'know', 'ever', 'existed', 'mouth', 'chains', 'sales', 'parlors', 'sleeping', 'arrangements', 'competitiveness', 'master', 'favor.This', 'not', 'feel-good', 'joyful', 'experience', 'think', 'anybody', 'who', 'film', 'only', 'better', 'wiser', 'understanding', 'sad', 'chapter', 'American', 'history']",12 Years a Slave

The numerous 1* reviews are from viewers who mistakenly bought the original version, thereby distorting the ratings.Though he claims to be essentially a happy person, Steve McQueen gravitates towards unsettling emotive subjects, directing with sensitivity and insight. He focuses on fallibility - both of the system and of humanity. Michael Fassbender has featured in all 3 of his full length movies to date - they make a great team.Under McQueen's superb direction in ""Hunger"" (2008), Fassbender plays IRA activist Bobby Sands' highly publicized hunger strike in the Maze prison in 1981. His next project, ""Shame"" (2011) shows Fassbender as a 30-something sex addict whose life spirals out of control. ""12 Years a Slave"" is loosely based on the true story (written by Solomon Northup in 1853) of a free black man from New York abducted and sold into slavery in the South. Here, Fassbender is the unhinged cotton plantation owner, Epps. He has a meaty role, but this time it is Ejiofor's movie.Given McQueen's choices of subject matter, it is little wonder that one feels completely wrung out after watching any of his movies. The McQueen/Fassbender combination is flawless and it is also no suprise that McQueen's movies have all won numerous awards, as have his lead actors.There have been many books, movies and TV series on the subject of slavery in America. The 1977 TV series ""Roots"" and Spielberg's 1997 movie ""Amistad"" stand out together with ""12 Years a Slave"" in visually depicting different aspects of this brutal, misguided practice.The imagery, cinematography, set design, musical score and acting in ""12 Years"" is faultless. Chiwetel Ejiofor truly owns the role of Solomon/Platt, as do Fassbender as Epps and newcomer Lupita Nyong'o as Patsey.Fassbender (Irish/German), and Ejiofor (British) never let their accents slip. (McQueen is British too). With the exception of Bryan Batt as Judge Turner and Brad Pitt's wooden cameo as the pivotal Bass, fine performances all round. (Did Pitt, as co-producer just need to show his face, without putting some effort into it?)But nothing is perfect, including this movie. There were a couple of scenes that just didn't gel. On the boat, a slaver stabs an abductee when he tries to intervene in the rape of a woman, a radical departure of Northup's account of the voyage. Much is made of the value of slaves as property, so this murder would not have been without serious consequences, or probably would not have happened at all.In another scene, a fallen white overseer arrives at the plantation to join the pickers for paid labour. After a brief conversation with Solomon explaining his situation, Solomon decides to trust him with a matter that could have dire consequences if exposed (no spoilers). Solomon, an intelligent, educated man, would never have done that.To really nit-pick, the frame of the half constructed gazebo is much larger than the finished product.At times, the movie wallowed - editors please? There has been criticism that Northup's freedom and the post-slavery prosecution of his abductors/owners only featured in the closing credits.

There was much I admired in this movie. It was wonderfully crafted. It had an aura of total authenticity about it.Then why only one star? A big part of my rating is that very authenticity. It was like watching a documentary. Except it wasn&#8217;t documentary. It was a dramatization of one man&#8217;s memoir published over 150 years ago. I personally believe that it was actually authentic, but I can just as easily see someone of the ilk of a Holocaust-denier or a climate-change denier claiming that it&#8217;s a hoax, that it was all made up. Conversely, I can see white-supremacist organizations using this film as a training reel for &#8220;this is how THEY should be treated.&#8221; I hated &#8220;Django Unchained,&#8221; and couldn&#8217;t understand why notable actors appeared in that film, but I would rather watch &#8220;Django Unchained&#8221; six times in a row, than to have sit through &#8220;12 Years a Slave&#8221; even once.Since it is not a documentary, what is the point of this film? A film, especially, a Best Picture winner, should in some way illuminate and enhance the human condition. Is my condition enhanced because I would rather walk into a gas chamber in Auschwitz than live under the conditions these slaves were living under? I think not.It is ironic to me that Chiwetel Ejiofor first came to my attention in the film, &#8220;Amistad,&#8221; a film that I believe SHOULD have won best picture, and remains one of the truly great American films. &#8220;Amistad&#8221; had its central section depicting the suffering of the slaves during their transatlantic voyage. I can&#8217;t remember exactly how many minutes it went on, but it was enough. It conveyed the degradation, the suffering, the horror completely. We got it. We didn&#8217;t need anymore. The rest of the film could deal with the struggle for decency and rightness.Yes, &#8220;12 Years a Slave&#8221; was authentic. It went on for two hours and 15 minutes. It would have been more authentic if it went on for 12 years. Should the film have been that long? Would it have added anything if it was?

Everyone is going about their day; working, doing laundry, cooking, as Solomon is slowly dying in agony, all in plain view.

Steve McQueen's ""12 Years a Slave"" is one of those. The true story of Solomon Northup, a free black man in upstate New York in 1841 who was kidnapped and sold into slavery, the film shows the total horror and degradation of living as a slave, as well as the total corruption of slave traders and masters.Chiwetel Ejiofor is quietly, burningly powerful as Northup, a man torn from his happy family life to face years of torture and brutalization. You could call his experience a Hitchcockian nightmare, except that the phrase trivializes the absolute horror of his situation. Yet as hideous as Northup's situation is, it is relatively comfortable compared with the fate of Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o), a woman enslaved by plantation owners Edwin and Martha Epps (Michael Fassbender, Sarah Paulson). The epitome of crazed corruption, Edwin likes to pretend that Patsy is his mistress by choice, and Martha likes to pretend that Patsey is her rival. Both are too twisted to recognize the truth: that Patsey is a helpless pawn driven to the brink of suicide by the unspeakable sadism of her master and mistress.The very title gives away that Northup's servitude comes to an end. Yet even when it does, there is no feeling of closure; he lost 12 years of his life for no reason, and Patsey and the other slaves live on in agony. ""12 Years a Slave"" is a movie that lingers powerfully in the memory, and stands as a rebuke to films that made the plantation system look benign (""Gone with the Wind"") or turned it into an action-revenge-movie joke (""Django Unchained"").

1676970,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00G4Q3KOC,M. Oleson,"[165, 199]","Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.It is unlikely anyone who goes to see this film won't have some idea about what it's about.  There have been many fine films about slavery.  And while 2012's ""Django Unchained"" certainly has violent elements associated with American slavery, that film and others often remind you that it's only a movie.  This movie will draw you in and does so with the unique history of Solomon Northup, an actual freeman who lived a good life in Saratoga, New York.  In 1841, he had a beautiful wife and 2 children (one played by Oscar nominee Quvenshane Wallis).  He was a classical violinist and highly respected in the community.Approached by a pair of ""gentlemen"" (including a couldn't-believe-my-eyes Taran Killam from ""Saturday Night Live"") Solomon (an amazing Chiwetel Ejiofor) is enticed by a financial offer to play a gig in Washington, D. C.  Once there, he is kidnapped, shackled and sent by steamer to New Orleans.  Upon his arrival he is sold as an escaped slave.  During this first act, Solomon must quickly learn how to behave, how to act.  Just to stay alive.  Even talking is frowned upon, so Ejiofor must speak to the audience with his eyes and his expressions to project the torment he is experiencing.  Director Steve McQueen often focuses the camera on faces to bring out the pain of the oppressed as well as the viciousness of the oppressors.  McQueen doesn't shy away from anything so be prepared.Slaves, both men and women, are herded together like cattle.  They are stripped, hosed down and sold naked.  It is hard to watch.  Even harder, mothers and children are separated.  This is gut-wrenching story telling.  Solomon, now called Platt, must hold it together, keeping his wits so that he can eventually reunite with his family.  Solomon is first sold to Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch), a man of some benevolence as slave owners go.  He gives Solomon a violin.  He is relatively kind.  He is portrayed as a man who is uncomfortable with his position but must accept his role as master.  When Ford's cotton crop is infested with disease, he must transfer ownership of some of his slaves and does so to Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender in another great performance).Epps is a polar opposite to the meek-mannered Ford.  He is vicious and violently sadistic.  As noted above, McQueen and his photographer bring out the evil in Fassbender's performance.  Epps is not only focused on teaching Solomon a lesson, he always has eyes for a slave known as Patsey (newcomer Lupita Nyong'o).  She is but a wisp of a woman but always picks more cotton than any of the men.  She is regularly raped by Epps, to the point he doesn't even hide it from his wife (Sarah Paulson).  This means that Patsey not only receives harsh treatment from Edwin but from his wife in equal measure.  Solomon does his best to comfort Patsey, but has his own agenda.In one sequence Solomon trusts a white slave (who knew?), under Edwin's control to work off a debt, with the promise to mail a letter back to his family.  The man is paid what few coins Solomon had and upon his release promises to mail the yet written letter.  Instead, he rats out Solomon to Epps.  When confronted, a tired Solomon must quickly formulate a lie.  Looking Epps directly in the eye, Solomon without a quiver, delivers a believable story without hesitation.  Remarkable stuff.Remember what I said about ""it's only a movie?""  There is one shattering scene where Solomon is forced by Epps to whip the stripped Patsey as punishment for her wandering off to a nearby plantation.  And for a while, as uncomfortable as it is to watch, we only see the pain in Solomon's face as he lashes Patsey.  OK, enough already right?  Instead, McQueen swivels his camera around the tree to see the peeled and scarred back of the woman as the whip tears off her skin.  This is tear-inducing filmmaking on many levels, but this scene induced many gasps from the audience and a couple walk-outs.But McQueen and screenwriter John Ridley want audiences to see the evil and feel the pain in the film.  And boy do they succeed.  I would be remiss if I didn't talk about some of the technical elements of the film.  During some of the difficult scenes rather than averting my eyes, I was able to focus briefly on some of the great photography in the film.  As unusual and contradictory as it may seem, ""12 Years"" is technically masterful.  The soft glow of the cotton fields, the hazy setting of the sun, the insect spreading its wings, somehow add a respite of civility to this great film of a disgraceful American past.  Look for Oscar nomination for actors Ejiofor, Fassbender and Nyong'o, director McQueen and more.",5,A gut-wrenching history lesson by a masterful filmmaker,1383523200,"11 4, 2013",2013,4688,"['Theatrical', 'review', 'may', 'be', 'spoilers.It', 'unlikely', 'anyone', 'who', 'see', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'about', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'fine', 'films', 'slavery', '2012', 'Django', 'Unchained', 'certainly', 'violent', 'elements', 'associated', 'American', 'slavery', 'film', 'others', 'often', 'remind', 'only', 'movie', 'movie', 'will', 'draw', 'so', 'unique', 'history', 'Solomon', 'Northup', 'actual', 'freeman', 'who', 'lived', 'good', 'life', 'Saratoga', 'New', 'York', '1841', 'had', 'beautiful', 'wife', '2', 'children', 'one', 'played', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Quvenshane', 'Wallis', 'was', 'classical', 'violinist', 'highly', 'respected', 'community.Approached', 'pair', 'gentlemen', 'including', ""couldn't-believe-my-eyes"", 'Taran', 'Killam', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'Solomon', 'amazing', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'enticed', 'financial', 'offer', 'play', 'gig', 'Washington', 'D.', 'C.', 'Once', 'there', 'kidnapped', 'shackled', 'sent', 'steamer', 'New', 'Orleans', 'arrival', 'sold', 'escaped', 'slave', 'first', 'act', 'Solomon', 'must', 'quickly', 'learn', 'how', 'behave', 'how', 'act', 'Just', 'stay', 'alive', 'Even', 'talking', 'frowned', 'Ejiofor', 'must', 'speak', 'audience', 'eyes', 'expressions', 'project', 'torment', 'experiencing', 'Director', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'often', 'camera', 'bring', 'out', 'pain', 'oppressed', 'as', 'well', 'viciousness', 'oppressors', 'McQueen', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'anything', 'so', 'be', 'prepared.Slaves', 'men', 'women', 'are', 'herded', 'together', 'like', 'cattle', 'are', 'stripped', 'hosed', 'down', 'sold', 'naked', 'hard', 'watch', 'Even', 'harder', 'mothers', 'children', 'are', 'separated', 'gut-wrenching', 'story', 'telling', 'Solomon', 'now', 'called', 'Platt', 'must', 'hold', 'together', 'keeping', 'wits', 'so', 'can', 'eventually', 'reunite', 'family', 'Solomon', 'first', 'sold', 'Ford', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'man', 'benevolence', 'slave', 'owners', 'go', 'Solomon', 'violin', 'relatively', 'kind', 'portrayed', 'man', 'who', 'uncomfortable', 'position', 'must', 'accept', 'role', 'master', 'When', 'Ford', 'cotton', 'crop', 'infested', 'disease', 'must', 'transfer', 'ownership', 'slaves', 'so', 'Edwin', 'Epps', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'great', 'performance', '.Epps', 'polar', 'opposite', 'meek-mannered', 'Ford', 'vicious', 'violently', 'sadistic', 'noted', 'McQueen', 'photographer', 'bring', 'out', 'evil', 'Fassbender', 'performance', 'Epps', 'not', 'only', 'focused', 'teaching', 'Solomon', 'lesson', 'always', 'eyes', 'slave', 'known', 'Patsey', 'newcomer', 'Lupita', 'Nyong', 'o', 'wisp', 'woman', 'always', 'more', 'cotton', 'men', 'regularly', 'raped', 'Epps', 'point', ""n't"", 'even', 'hide', 'wife', 'Sarah', 'Paulson', 'Patsey', 'not', 'only', 'harsh', 'treatment', 'Edwin', 'wife', 'equal', 'measure', 'Solomon', 'best', 'comfort', 'Patsey', 'own', 'agenda.In', 'one', 'sequence', 'Solomon', 'white', 'slave', 'who', 'knew', 'Edwin', 'control', 'work', 'off', 'debt', 'promise', 'mail', 'letter', 'back', 'family', 'man', 'paid', 'what', 'few', 'coins', 'Solomon', 'had', 'release', 'mail', 'yet', 'written', 'letter', 'Instead', 'out', 'Solomon', 'Epps', 'When', 'confronted', 'tired', 'Solomon', 'must', 'quickly', 'formulate', 'lie', 'Looking', 'Epps', 'directly', 'eye', 'Solomon', 'quiver', 'believable', 'story', 'hesitation', 'Remarkable', 'stuff.Remember', 'what', 'said', 'only', 'movie', 'one', 'shattering', 'scene', 'where', 'Solomon', 'forced', 'Epps', 'whip', 'stripped', 'Patsey', 'punishment', 'wandering', 'off', 'nearby', 'plantation', 'while', 'as', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'only', 'see', 'pain', 'Solomon', 'face', 'Patsey', 'OK', 'enough', 'already', 'right', 'Instead', 'McQueen', 'camera', 'tree', 'see', 'peeled', 'scarred', 'back', 'woman', 'whip', 'skin', 'tear-inducing', 'filmmaking', 'many', 'levels', 'scene', 'induced', 'many', 'gasps', 'audience', 'couple', 'walk-outs.But', 'McQueen', 'screenwriter', 'John', 'Ridley', 'want', 'audiences', 'see', 'evil', 'feel', 'pain', 'film', 'boy', 'do', 'succeed', 'would', 'be', 'remiss', 'did', ""n't"", 'talk', 'technical', 'elements', 'film', 'difficult', 'scenes', 'rather', 'averting', 'eyes', 'was', 'able', 'focus', 'briefly', 'great', 'photography', 'film', 'unusual', 'contradictory', 'may', 'seem', '12', 'Years', 'technically', 'masterful', 'soft', 'glow', 'cotton', 'fields', 'hazy', 'setting', 'sun', 'insect', 'spreading', 'wings', 'somehow', 'add', 'respite', 'civility', 'great', 'film', 'disgraceful', 'American', 'past', 'Look', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'actors', 'Ejiofor', 'Fassbender', 'Nyong', 'o', 'director', 'McQueen', 'more']",12 Years a Slave

Amazon streaming has degenerated such that it is no longer a good way to watch movies in my Home Theater. I have twice now paid for a movie in High Definition but the movie was delivered in something substantially less.  Right now I'm considering renting it in a Blu-ray from from Netflix.But even more importantly this film is about a trivial subject that has been hyped outrageously by political partisans. This movie is about a free black man being kidnapped into servitude. This was never a problem in America. If this particular case was legitimate it seems to be the only one. At this same time thousands of white men were routinely kidnapped and put into brutal servitude.First let's consider if this one individual case is credible. At the time it happened - before 1853 - it was legal to import black slaves from Africa. But in this sensational case two white men concoct an illegal scheme to capture a northern free man of color and sell him as a field hand. One of the men involved in this case had formerly committed a popular fraud of the day that was  depicted  in the James Garner movie 'Skin Game'. White con men would sell a black confederate in the South and then later free him so as to do it all over again. The black man in this kind of con game was in danger of not being freed. And this is what some think happened to Solomon Northup.We will never know the truth of it. Was it a real kidnapping or a con game that went sour? In a way it doesn't matter. If it was legitimate it was very unusual. If it happened the way it was portrayed in the best seller of 1853 it was a very rare crime. The two alleged kidnappers were caught but were not prosecuted. Some think it was because Northup and the whites were found to be partners.But white kidnappings and enslavement were very, very common. In fact we went to war twice over white enslavement.The British needed men to man their fleet. They adopted the policy of impressment. Press gangs routinely kidnapped able bodied white men from pubs and rooming houses near the sea. An impressed seaman had it worse than a black agricultural slave in almost everyway. They were treated worse. They were whipped more, ate worse food and worked harder, under much more dangerous conditions. They had shorter life spans. They were locked below decks when in port. They were not free.Unlike black slaves impressed white men were often killed. Like soldiers in the Napoleonic British Army they were beaten to death as a lesson for the others. British soldiers and sailors could be sentenced to a thousand lashes. No man can survive that sentence . Typically the soldier would pass out and be revived day after day until they finally died. Field slaves were never treated that way. Black slaves were too expensive and hard to replace.Impressed seamen ate salt beef, wormy dried biscuits and had little fresh water, Black slaves on farms ate much better and had far better housing. They also usually had wives and families. The average life span of an impressed sailor was only a few years. Sailing ships were very dangerous places.The British only abandoned floggings in the late 19th century - decades after the all the black slaves had been freed.I'm sure black slavery in the America South was unpleasant but it was nowhere near as unpleasant as the treatment that others of that day experienced.",1,Silly Racial Propaganda,1398124800,"04 22, 2014",2014,3415,"['have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'Amazon', 'am', 'not', 'likely', 'Amazon', 'streaming', 'degenerated', 'no', 'longer', 'good', 'way', 'watch', 'movies', 'Home', 'Theater', 'have', 'twice', 'now', 'paid', 'movie', 'High', 'Definition', 'movie', 'was', 'delivered', 'something', 'substantially', 'less', 'Right', 'now', ""'m"", 'considering', 'renting', 'Blu-ray', 'Netflix.But', 'even', 'more', 'importantly', 'film', 'trivial', 'subject', 'been', 'hyped', 'outrageously', 'political', 'partisans', 'movie', 'free', 'black', 'man', 'being', 'kidnapped', 'servitude', 'was', 'never', 'problem', 'America', 'particular', 'case', 'was', 'legitimate', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'same', 'time', 'thousands', 'white', 'men', 'were', 'routinely', 'kidnapped', 'put', 'brutal', 'servitude.First', 'let', 'consider', 'one', 'individual', 'case', 'credible', 'time', 'happened', '1853', 'was', 'legal', 'import', 'black', 'slaves', 'Africa', 'sensational', 'case', 'two', 'white', 'men', 'concoct', 'illegal', 'scheme', 'capture', 'northern', 'free', 'man', 'color', 'sell', 'field', 'hand', 'One', 'men', 'involved', 'case', 'had', 'formerly', 'committed', 'popular', 'fraud', 'day', 'was', 'depicted', 'James', 'Garner', 'movie', 'Game', 'White', 'con', 'men', 'would', 'sell', 'black', 'confederate', 'South', 'then', 'later', 'free', 'so', 'do', 'over', 'again', 'black', 'man', 'kind', 'con', 'game', 'was', 'danger', 'not', 'being', 'freed', 'what', 'think', 'happened', 'Solomon', 'Northup.We', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'truth', 'Was', 'real', 'kidnapping', 'con', 'game', 'went', 'sour', 'way', ""n't"", 'matter', 'was', 'legitimate', 'was', 'very', 'unusual', 'happened', 'way', 'was', 'portrayed', 'best', 'seller', '1853', 'was', 'very', 'rare', 'crime', 'two', 'alleged', 'kidnappers', 'were', 'caught', 'were', 'not', 'prosecuted', 'think', 'was', 'Northup', 'whites', 'were', 'found', 'be', 'partners.But', 'white', 'kidnappings', 'enslavement', 'were', 'very', 'very', 'common', 'fact', 'went', 'war', 'twice', 'white', 'enslavement.The', 'British', 'needed', 'men', 'man', 'fleet', 'adopted', 'policy', 'impressment', 'Press', 'gangs', 'routinely', 'kidnapped', 'able', 'bodied', 'white', 'men', 'pubs', 'rooming', 'houses', 'sea', 'impressed', 'seaman', 'had', 'worse', 'black', 'agricultural', 'slave', 'almost', 'everyway', 'were', 'treated', 'worse', 'were', 'whipped', 'more', 'ate', 'worse', 'food', 'worked', 'harder', 'much', 'more', 'dangerous', 'conditions', 'had', 'shorter', 'life', 'spans', 'were', 'locked', 'decks', 'when', 'port', 'were', 'not', 'free.Unlike', 'black', 'slaves', 'impressed', 'white', 'men', 'were', 'often', 'killed', 'soldiers', 'Napoleonic', 'British', 'Army', 'were', 'beaten', 'death', 'lesson', 'others', 'British', 'soldiers', 'sailors', 'could', 'be', 'sentenced', 'thousand', 'lashes', 'man', 'can', 'survive', 'sentence', 'Typically', 'soldier', 'would', 'pass', 'out', 'be', 'revived', 'day', 'day', 'finally', 'died', 'Field', 'slaves', 'were', 'never', 'treated', 'way', 'Black', 'slaves', 'were', 'too', 'expensive', 'hard', 'replace.Impressed', 'seamen', 'ate', 'salt', 'beef', 'wormy', 'dried', 'biscuits', 'had', 'little', 'fresh', 'water', 'Black', 'farms', 'ate', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'far', 'better', 'housing', 'also', 'usually', 'had', 'wives', 'families', 'average', 'life', 'span', 'impressed', 'sailor', 'was', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'Sailing', 'ships', 'were', 'very', 'dangerous', 'places.The', 'British', 'only', 'abandoned', 'floggings', 'late', '19th', 'century', 'decades', 'black', 'slaves', 'had', 'been', 'freed.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'black', 'slavery', 'America', 'South', 'was', 'unpleasant', 'was', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'unpleasant', 'treatment', 'others', 'day', 'experienced']",12 Years a Slave

1677013,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00G4Q3KOC,Paul Allaer,"[11, 19]","""12 Years A Slave"" (2013 release; 134 min.) brings to the big screen the book written by Solomon Northup in 1853, to tell the world of his ordeal as a slave in the deep South after having been abducted. As the movie opens, we go back-and-forth between scene of Northup with his family in Saratoga, New York and Northup on a plantation camp. We are not even 15 min. into the movie when Northup, having been deceived by a couple of artists into coming to Washington DC with them, is abducted and eventually sold into slavery. Another slave gives him a piece of advice on how to survive (:keep your head low""), to which Northup responds ""I don't want to survive, I want to LIVE!"". To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this movie is directed by Steve McQueen, who previously brought us the equally excellent ""Hunger"" (from 2008) and ""Shame"" (from 2011). The latter was the at times shocking sex-addiction drama starring Michael Fassbender, and Fassbender is of course also one of the main actors in ""12 Years"" (more on that later). Second, this movie will likely shock you, as it certainly did me. There are many unsettling scenes, with extensive violence including multiple beatings, hangings, and whip-lashings. If it is done to make the movie as authentic as possible, then there is no argument against including these scenes. But it also makes clear that this movie is rated R for a reason. (I would not recommend that anyone younger than 14 or 15 watch this movie.) Third, the acting performances are stellar throughout the movie, none more so than Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northup. Surely he will get a Best Actor Oscar nomination for this masterful performance. There are tons of other choice roles, including the already mention Fassbender as the cruel plantation owner, but also Adepero Oduye as fellow slave Eliza. At one point Eliza gets separated from her 2 children and just falls apart, to which the plantation wife responds ""your children will soon be forgotten"" (there was a huge groan from the theatre audience then) Keep your eyes open for a cameo from Brad Pitt (less than 5 min. of screen time), Pitt's production company Plan B played a significant role in bringing this movie to the big screen. At the very end of the movie, we are informed what became of Northup after the publication of the 1853 book, as well as what became of his abductors.This movie has been playing in a few select cities the last 2-3 weeks and finally was rolled out to more cities this week. It opened in Cincinnati and I went to see it right away. The late matinee screening I saw this at was very well attended, which is great news as this movie deserves to be seen both for its historical context as well as for the top quality movie that it is.

1677015,A28NELCXZEJ8ED,B00G4Q3KOC,Paul Condylis,"[0, 0]","An important film, dramatically as well as sociologically and historically.  Its honesty and sober subject are refreshing in an era of easy emotionalism, violence and gratuitous &#34;action&#34; in so many films.  The acting and directing are first rate.  The directing is sensitive.  There seems to be a problem in editing and perhaps the writing as well.  A common problem: the editor and director are so close to the story, they don't realize that some of the editing obscures clarity, causing confusion for the audience.  I suspect that some of this is because it's felt the audience doesn't need a lot of hand-holding; &#34;they can figure out some things on their own&#34;.  That's appreciated to some extent, but attention to clarity ought to be scrupulously followed.  Nevertheless, the film was deeply moving and disturbing for the light shown on the malignancy of slavery and cruelty on an individual level as well as cultural.  I have an ancestor who was a slave holding, plantation owner.  Having seen this excellent film now, I am even more saddened by it all; the whole issue of the inhumanity is closer to home and the tragedy felt more personally.  Finally, it must be said the overall work was artistically superb and unique in its needed treatment of an evil scar in the history of mankind and our country.Paul Condylis",4,"SUPERB FILM, A NEEDED TREATMENT OF EVIL IN OUR PAST",1395705600,"03 25, 2014",2014,1337,"['important', 'film', 'dramatically', 'as', 'well', 'sociologically', 'historically', 'honesty', 'sober', 'subject', 'are', 'refreshing', 'era', 'easy', 'emotionalism', 'violence', 'gratuitous', '34', 'action', '34', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'acting', 'directing', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'directing', 'sensitive', 'be', 'problem', 'editing', 'perhaps', 'writing', 'as', 'well', 'common', 'problem', 'editor', 'director', 'are', 'so', 'close', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'editing', 'clarity', 'causing', 'confusion', 'audience', 'suspect', 'felt', 'audience', ""n't"", 'need', 'lot', 'hand-holding', '34', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'things', 'own', '34', 'appreciated', 'extent', 'attention', 'clarity', 'ought', 'be', 'scrupulously', 'followed', 'Nevertheless', 'film', 'was', 'deeply', 'moving', 'disturbing', 'light', 'shown', 'malignancy', 'slavery', 'cruelty', 'individual', 'level', 'as', 'well', 'cultural', 'have', 'ancestor', 'who', 'was', 'slave', 'holding', 'plantation', 'owner', 'Having', 'seen', 'excellent', 'film', 'now', 'am', 'even', 'more', 'saddened', 'whole', 'issue', 'inhumanity', 'closer', 'home', 'tragedy', 'felt', 'more', 'personally', 'Finally', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'overall', 'work', 'was', 'artistically', 'superb', 'unique', 'needed', 'treatment', 'evil', 'scar', 'history', 'mankind', 'country.Paul', 'Condylis']",12 Years a Slave

Regarding 2013&#8217;s entry in the genre, &#8220;12 Years a Slave,&#8221; black author Orville Lloyd Douglas declared in the newspaper The Guardian he wouldn&#8217;t go see it, explaining, &#34;Regardless of your race, these films are unlikely to teach you anything you don't already know&#8230; As a black person, I can honestly say I am exhausted and bored with these kinds of &#8216;dramatic race&#8217; films.&#34; Now, you can agree with him or not, but he makes a point &#8211; slave movies tend to tell the same kind of story over and over. And over.British director Steve McQueen is pretty famous in his homeland for making movies about bleak subjects. Now he tries to bring a fresh perspective to that piece of American history that we all love to hate. &#8220;12 Years a Slave&#8221; is based on the true story of Solomon Northrup, a well-educated, wealthy black free man living in New York with his wife and kids. He is kidnapped by slavers and sold to a plantation near New Orleans, and spends the next twelve years trying to make sense of what happened to him and hoping to make it back home.McQueen really tries to make this more than just your typical &#8220;slave movie&#8221;. He spends some time exploring the fact that slavery wasn&#8217;t really about racism &#8211; it was about money. It was (and still is) an economic system that exploits people for profit. In America, most of those people historically had dark skin. Solomon led a happy and comfortable life in New York &#8211; he was well-respected. He had money. This point is brought home later in the movie when Solomon meets a white slave picking cotton in the fields with him.Brad Pitt has a minor role in the movie, and his whole purpose (Besides being the Great White Rescuer) seems to be to explain to Solomon that racism and cruelty don&#8217;t cause slavery, but is the result of it. Racism developed as a way for people to justify the fact that they were treating people like property. Their consciences needed a way to hide from themselves the horror of what they were doing. So they covered it up with even more horror.Artistically, this movie is a success. The cinematography is beautiful, it is well-written and well-acted.It&#8217;s also hard to sit through. It is long, and there are some very violent parts. Sometimes, for extended moments, all action stops, and you are forced to just sit there and absorb the sounds of what&#8217;s going on in the scene &#8211; insects buzzing in the moss-covered trees, or a woman crying for her lost children, or a man being hung.&#8220;12 Years a Slave&#8221; is artful, beautiful, and focused. It tries to clarify a few stereotypes and myths about this important era of American History. But make no mistake, it is still a slave movie. And if you aren&#8217;t in the mood to watch two hours of torture and oppression, it will be hard to absorb any other lessons the movie offers.",4,"Tough to watch, but tries to bring something new to the topic",1387324800,"12 18, 2013",2013,2972,"['Black', 'race/slavery', 'movies', 'are', 'tricky', 'business', 'days', 'Regarding', '2013', '8217', 's', 'entry', 'genre', '8220', '12', 'Slave', '8221', 'black', 'author', 'Orville', 'Lloyd', 'Douglas', 'declared', 'newspaper', 'Guardian', 'wouldn', '8217', 'go', 'see', 'explaining', '34', 'Regardless', 'race', 'films', 'are', 'unlikely', 'teach', 'anything', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', '8230', 'black', 'person', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'am', 'exhausted', 'bored', 'kinds', '8216', 'dramatic', 'race', '8217', '34', 'Now', 'can', 'agree', 'not', 'point', '8211', 'slave', 'movies', 'tend', 'tell', 'same', 'kind', 'story', 'over.British', 'director', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'pretty', 'famous', 'homeland', 'making', 'movies', 'bleak', 'subjects', 'Now', 'bring', 'fresh', 'perspective', 'piece', 'American', 'history', 'love', 'hate', '8220', '12', 'Slave', '8221', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Solomon', 'Northrup', 'well-educated', 'wealthy', 'black', 'free', 'man', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'wife', 'kids', 'kidnapped', 'slavers', 'sold', 'plantation', 'New', 'Orleans', 'next', 'twelve', 'years', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'what', 'happened', 'hoping', 'make', 'back', 'home.McQueen', 'really', 'make', 'more', 'just', 'typical', '8220', 'slave', 'movie', '8221', 'time', 'exploring', 'fact', 'slavery', 'wasn', '8217', 't', 'really', 'racism', '8211', 'was', 'money', 'was', 'still', 'economic', 'system', 'people', 'profit', 'America', 'most', 'people', 'historically', 'had', 'dark', 'skin', 'Solomon', 'led', 'happy', 'comfortable', 'life', 'New', 'York', '8211', 'was', 'well-respected', 'had', 'money', 'point', 'brought', 'home', 'later', 'movie', 'when', 'Solomon', 'white', 'slave', 'picking', 'cotton', 'fields', 'him.Brad', 'Pitt', 'minor', 'role', 'movie', 'whole', 'purpose', 'being', 'Great', 'White', 'Rescuer', 'be', 'explain', 'Solomon', 'racism', 'cruelty', 'don', '8217', 'cause', 'slavery', 'result', 'Racism', 'developed', 'way', 'people', 'justify', 'fact', 'were', 'treating', 'people', 'property', 'consciences', 'needed', 'way', 'hide', 'horror', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'covered', 'up', 'even', 'more', 'horror.Artistically', 'movie', 'success', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'well-written', 'well-acted.It', '8217', 's', 'also', 'hard', 'sit', 'long', 'are', 'very', 'violent', 'parts', 'Sometimes', 'extended', 'moments', 'action', 'stops', 'are', 'forced', 'just', 'sit', 'there', 'absorb', 'sounds', 'what', '8217', 'going', 'scene', '8211', 'insects', 'buzzing', 'moss-covered', 'trees', 'woman', 'crying', 'lost', 'children', 'man', 'being', 'hung.', '8220', '12', 'Slave', '8221', 'artful', 'beautiful', 'focused', 'clarify', 'few', 'stereotypes', 'myths', 'important', 'era', 'American', 'History', 'make', 'mistake', 'still', 'slave', 'movie', 'aren', '8217', 't', 'mood', 'watch', 'two', 'hours', 'torture', 'oppression', 'will', 'be', 'hard', 'absorb', 'other', 'lessons', 'movie', 'offers']",12 Years a Slave

It gives visual image of the horrific stain in American history that some people would rather dismiss and/or put void emphasis on the demoralizing effect it had/has on people of color.

It tells the story of the struggle and courage of a free black man who is kidnapped and sold into slavery. His story unfolds telling how he tried to grasp the idea of how someone could be so cruel to not think of him as a man and sell him into slavery; his struggle in trying to understand the ""why's"" of slavery; his struggle in trying to regain his freedom in a society that would rather keep him enslaved and treated as chattel.

(Academy Awards, Golden Globes, BAFTA Awards, Screen Actors Guild, and so on &#8230;)12yearsaslaveAward winning director, Steve McQueen, has directed many short, and one other feature films. 12 Years A Slave should allow for this talented director to finally explode in Hollywood.Based on a true story, Solomon (portrayed by Chiwetel Ejiofor) tells about his need to Survive. As a FREE man once living in upstate New York, Solomon is kidnapped and sold into slavery. Although Solomon hid the fact he was educated, and could read and write &#8212; he oftentimes stood up for himself, (but rarely for others). The fear that filled him was powerful. His goal remained constant, and commendable &#8230; to stay alive and make it back home to his family. To Freedom.While some of Solomon&#8217;s encounters reveal. . .kindness, most of the slave owners and hired hands treat the slaves with less respect than what is shown to pigs in a stable. This is not an easy movie to watch. The violent and abusive physical, mental, and sexual treatment of human beings was more than enough to make my stomach churn. I had a constant knot in my gut, and oftentimes had to wipe tears from my eyes. There are countless scenes where people are whipped, hung, beaten, berated and raped.However, this was a movie I am glad I saw. It was powerful and provoking. It made me angry and very sad. I find it difficult and horrifying to believe slavery was prevalent in our country, and even more shocking that it lasted as long as it did.12 Years A Slave is an &#8220;R&#8221; rated, 134 minute long film that will hold you captive.

I wasn't sure what to expect going into this film considering that films over the past 10 years have often not been what they once were. But this movie is not just great, it's a revelation. Director Steve McQueen has created a tense, spellbinding masterwork in the tradition of what makes cinema truly great. And to add to that it is not only a very important and beautifully told story about the evils that was once slavery in America, but it is also a very realistic testament to what African american's were forced to endure in a very dark time in this nation's history. The film is often very bleak and brutal, but also drives home in a very powerful way just how terrible the injustice of slavery truly was and is.Rarely have I seen such a subject treated so realistically and so honestly. This is a must see, and easily not only the best movie of the year but probably the best film of the decade. It's unflinching, honest, heart breaking and powerful.

1677036,AVL5IDEE8YA3D,B00G4Q3KOC,Rachel McElhany,"[4, 7]","Last week I reviewed the book 12 Years A Slave. This weekend I saw the movie adaptation of the book, also titled 12 Years A Slave. Unless you live under a rock, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard of the movie and that it&#8217;s been nominated for several Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Chiwetel Ejiofor for Best Actor, Michael Fassbender for Best Supporting Actor, Lupita Nyong&#8217;o for Best Supporting Actress and Steve McQueen for Best Director.I found the movie to be a great adaptation of the book. Some things were condensed or not explained in as much detail as they were in the book but the overall sense of the dreadful life of a slave was still there. The story is told in a non-linear fashion with flashbacks to Solomon&#8217;s life before he was kidnapped into slavery. The one thing that really bothered me was the opening scene in which Solomon is having sex with another slave. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a spoiler to say that in the book, Solomon is faithful to his wife during his entire time in slavery. I&#8217;m not really sure what the purpose of the sex scene was supposed to be. If you have an idea of why it was included, please tell me!The movie is produced by Brad Pitt&#8217;s production company, Plan B. I found it funny that Brad Pitt cast himself as the one truly good guy in the South, even though it&#8217;s a very small role. His character is originally from Canada but had a southern accent. Did Canadians speak with the accent they have now &#8211; aboot for about and the like &#8211; back in the 1800s? I would have liked him to speak that way. Ejiofor, who plays Solomon was phenomenal. At times, the camera would just stay on a silent close-up of his face for several seconds and his agony was palpable. That&#8217;s a testament to McQeen&#8217;s great directing as well.Fassbender was really good, but there&#8217;s no way he&#8217;ll beat Jared Leto of Dallas Buyer&#8217;s Club for Best Supporting Actor. Nyong&#8217;o was fabulous and she had some of the hardest, most emotional scenes of the movie. I think she deserves to win Best Supporting Actress for sure.This was a hard but wonderful movie.

1677044,A3B4TA7LWFHQKL,B00G4Q3KOC,RealWoman8,"[0, 1]","I am a big fan of Steve McQueen's movies,and 12 Years a Slave did not disappoint. It's a gritty and visceral tale of a free man who is kidnapped and then enslaved on Southern plantations. I won't bother summarizing, as others have done it already, but I thought the acting was excellent -- one of my favorite (and very Steve McQueen) moments was an extended shot of Solomon just staring around himself while thunder rumbled ominously in the background, and you couldn't help but ache for this man who lived in terror every day -- it was moments like that, thoughtful, unhurried moments, that made this movie so very moving. Chiwetel Ejiofor's transformation from an educated man to the quivering persona he had to maintain to survive was striking.Steve McQueen has an amazing talent for hearing the space between the notes, so to speak. This is not a fast-paced film with clear-cut good guys and bad guys. We see Solomon, our protagonist, refuse to end one woman's misery as well as whip her; and we see a cruel slave owner treating a little slave girl like his own daughter.

It is based on the true story of Solomon Northrup, a free black man from New York, who was kidnapped and sold into slavery, serving under two different masters in Louisiana for 12 years. The original autobiography by Northrup was independently researched and found to be essentially true. Director Steve McQueen has taken some liberties with Northrup's story for dramatic effect; but it is essentially faithful to the original. The biggest liberty taken is the harsh treatment of Christianity. Northrup was a devout Christian and his faith continued while he was a slave; even helping him to endure his often brutal treatment. While Biblical texts were used (wrongly) by slave owner to justify slavery, Christianity was also the basis for the abolition of slavery. Like other historical films that depict brutality - &#34;Schindler's List&#34;, &#34;The Passion of the Christ&#34;, etc - this film is difficult to watch - especially the brutal beatings that took place - but like &#34;Schindler's List&#34; and &#34;Passion&#34;, it was a box office hit and has garnered numerous awards. While Lupita Nyong'o, in her feature film debut, won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, the strongest performances are by Chiwetal Ejiofor as Northrup; and Michael Fassbender as the sadistic slave owner, Edwin Epps. Also look for strong support performances by Benedict Cumberbatch, as Northrup's first relatively benevolent owner; Sarah Paulson as Mary Epps; Paul Giamatti as a slave dealer; and Paul Dano as a plantation toady who lords it over Northrup.

1677069,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00G4Q3KOC,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 1]","Steve McQueen's Oscar-winning masterpiece ""12 Years a Slave"" is one of the first movies about slavery to actually be told from the viewpoint of the slaves. I know that seems an odd thing to say, but Hollywood's past is littered with well-intentioned dramas that, driven by the need to appeal to the widest possible audience, have filtered their racially- charged stories through the eyes of sympathetic white characters, who are there not merely to right moral wrongs and to alleviate the sufferings of the afflicted, but to make the audience feel better about themselves, secure in the knowledge that THEY would surely never have participated in anything so vile or unjust had they been there at the time. Not that that aren't a few ""decent"" slave owners around - ""decent"" being but a relative term here - but those who made ""12 Years a Slave"" have no intention of letting the audience off the hook so easily. As Eliza - a woman who has had her two children cruelly ripped away from her and sold to someone else - points out to a fellow slave when he begins to describe the plantation master as a decent man, no person who buys and sells other human beings as property can ever be described as decent or good.""12 Years a Slave"" is based on the experiences of Solomon Northrup, a freeman living in New York who literally woke up one day in 1841 to find himself kidnapped, shackled and sold into slavery in the South. Northrup was an educated man, a farmer, a violinist, a husband and a father of two, but none of that was enough to protect him from the scourge of slavery that had imprisoned so many of his fellow black men and women in the country. Upon his eventual release, Northrup wrote a memoir entitled ""12 Years a Slave,"" chronicling his years in captivity, which has now been adapted into an Oscar-winning screenplay by John Ridley.Among other things, ""12 Years a Slave"" is probably the most honest and unflinching portrayal of the realities of slavery ever captured on film, a reality that regularly included rapes, lashings, lynchings, the rending of families, and the non-stop degradation and de-humanization - all sanctioned by society and codified into law - of a whole race of people.On a broader scale, the movie also conveys what it was like having to live in a constant state of fear that a mere look, word or gesture - or even the slightest hint of self-defense or standing up for oneself or others - could result in a beating, a flogging or perhaps even death. It also shows what it was like being constantly at the mercy of some racist overseer's mood or whim, with no legal recourse or hope for justice - and the despairing belief that it would forever be thus. That is the world McQueen brings so vividly to life in ""12 Years a Slave.""The movie also portrays how slaves were often forced to turn on each other to alleviate their own suffering or perhaps improve their own chances of survival.In a highly risky but ultimately effective move, Ridley has chosen to provide dialogue whose elevated diction and syntactic complexity sounds vaguely strange to the modern ear. Even the uneducated slaves talk in this manner. It's a bit unsettling at first, but it underlines just how dedicated these filmmakers are to exploring the truth. Also unsettling is the harsh discordant horn that blares at various moments of intense suffering or high drama throughout the film.As Solomon, Chiwetel Ejiofor has the difficult task of bringing depth and wisdom to a character who is forced by circumstances to be reticent and passive. Yet, Ejiofor, in many small and subtle ways, allows us to see the man of strength and determination lurking behind the servile exterior. In a relatively small role, Lupita Nyong'o made enough of an impression on the Academy to walk off with the Best Supporting Actress Oscar portraying a young slave named Patsey, who may have found ""favor"" with the plantation master but who's life has become a living hell as a result. There are excellent performances as well by Michael Fassbender, Sarah Paulson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano, Adepero Oduye, Alfre Woodard and Brad Pitt.Because the movie IS so faithful to the brutal realities of slavery, it has earned the rather unfair reputation of being ""too difficult to watch,"" a fact that may have limited the size of its potential audience both in theaters and at home. Let me just say that, for all its harshness, ""12 Years a Slave"" is no more violent or ""unmatchable"" than any number of movies or TV shows from now or the recent past. Not by a long shot. In fact, I can think of at least a half a dozen shows currently running on cable TV that are far more violent than ""12 Years a Slave"" is. So if this is the reason why you may have been avoiding checking out one of the finest films of recent years, you might want to rethink that decision and at least give it a try. You won't regret it.",5,A movie every American must see,1398297600,"04 24, 2014",2014,4880,"['Steve', 'McQueen', 'Oscar-winning', 'masterpiece', '12', 'Slave', 'one', 'first', 'movies', 'slavery',

A brutally painful, difficult film to watch, at the same time impossible to turn away from. As much as I have ever known about the atrocity of slavery in this country, nothing really prepared me for the intensity of this film. It is incomprehensible to me, hard to wrap my mind around, the fact that in this country, these things actually happened, that slavery festered like an abscess for so long as part of the history of this country, and that the vestiges of the &#34;peculiar institution&#34; continue to linger to this day, poisoning the hearts and souls of so many Americans who have the audacity to try to apologize and defend and minimize the profound impact it had on so many lives, and continues to have. To describe the film as emotionally powerful is to not do it justice. Steve McQueen is a brilliant director, unflinching as a storyteller, who has succeeded in eliciting from his actors some of the most powerful performances I've seen on film. McQueen makes frequent use of very long screen shots, holding the camera on the subject far longer than one would expect, often to purposely draw the viewer into the agonizing brutality of a scene, but just as often to focus on the raw emotion of a human face who has lived through unspeakable things no one should every have had to live through. The result is at once absorbing and intensely discomforting. McQueen spares us nothing in his portrayal of the barbarously cruel and complete affront to human dignity that was slavery, nor should he, nor should anyone....a film this raw and honest in its portrayal of one of the darkest volumes of our history as a nation, was a long time coming; far too long, I think.

I tried to review it as a historical interpretation, moreso than as popular entertainment.This is a story well worth being told.  The writing hits it out of the park, particularly within the first 30 minutes or so.  It illustrates the sickness of slavery, from various angle and dimensions, powerfully and viscerally.  Fairly brilliant writing.After that the movie settles down into Solomon Northop's story.  It's a period piece, not popular entertainment.  It ebbs and flows and has a strong ending.The photography is beautiful, and the performances solid.  I'd cite Michael Fassbinder as giving the standout performance here.  He and Paul Dano's characters are the most interesting point of the movie to me; the way that the slaves' lives are so badly affected by their captors' desires and insecurities and foibles.  That level of sickness is presented here, full-on.  Chiwetel Ejiofor's performance carries the movie well.Luipta Nyong'o's performance is not so good ... frankly I think that the Oscar voters got the character and the actress confused here. If she can act, I haven't seen evidence of it yet.I don't think that Steve McQueen was a good director for this film.  His primary interest is in suffering - sado-masochism dressed up as art.  In his films, he generally tries (as do other sadists such as Lars von Trier and Michael Haneke) to inflict pain on his audience - to make them watch something horrific.  That approach makes sense for parts of this film; McQueen doesn't flinch from showing what's horrible in this story.  But he also, to my eyes, inflicts an S&M; fetish this film, inappropriately.  A rape/choking scene that we didn't need to watch.  An extreme whipping scene.  Some fetishizing of darkness and captivity.  And worst (to my taste) the exaggerated standing-on-tiptoes-for-hours lynching scene here, that makes it impossible to take this film as seriously as it should be taken.  He was the wrong man for this job and IMO keeps this film from being as effective as it should have been.",3,"Strong Writing, Sadistically Directed",1393891200,"03 4, 2014",2014,2095,"['Note', 'did', 'change', 'review', 'watching', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'tried', 'review', 'historical', 'interpretation', 'moreso', 'popular', 'entertainment.This', 'story', 'well', 'being', 'told', 'writing', 'hits', 'park', 'particularly', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'so', 'sickness', 'slavery', 'various', 'angle', 'dimensions', 'powerfully', 'viscerally', 'Fairly', 'brilliant', 'writing.After', 'movie', 'down', 'Solomon', 'Northop', 'story', 'period', 'piece', 'not', 'popular', 'entertainment', 'flows', 'strong', 'ending.The', 'photography', 'beautiful', 'performances', 'solid', ""'d"", 'cite', 'Michael', 'Fassbinder', 'giving', 'standout', 'performance', 'here', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'characters', 'are', 'most', 'interesting', 'point', 'movie', 'way', 'slaves', 'lives', 'are', 'so', 'badly', 'affected', 'captors', 'desires', 'insecurities', 'foibles', 'level', 'sickness', 'presented', 'here', 'full-on', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'performance', 'movie', 'well.Luipta', 'Nyong', 'o', 'performance', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'frankly', 'think', 'Oscar', 'voters', 'got', 'character', 'actress', 'confused', 'here', 'can', 'act', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'evidence', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'was', 'good', 'director', 'film', 'primary', 'interest', 'suffering', 'sado-masochism', 'dressed', 'up', 'art', 'films', 'generally', 'do', 'other', 'sadists', 'such', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'inflict', 'pain', 'audience', 'make', 'watch', 'something', 'horrific', 'approach', 'sense', 'parts', 'film', 'McQueen', ""n't"", 'flinch', 'showing', 'what', 'horrible', 'story', 'also', 'eyes', 'S', 'M', 'fetish', 'film', 'inappropriately', 'rape/choking', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'watch', 'extreme', 'whipping', 'scene', 'fetishizing', 'darkness', 'captivity', 'worst', 'taste', 'exaggerated', 'standing-on-tiptoes-for-hours', 'lynching', 'scene', 'here', 'impossible', 'take', 'film', 'as', 'seriously', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'was', 'wrong', 'man', 'job', 'IMO', 'film', 'being', 'as', 'effective', 'should', 'have', 'been']",12 Years a Slave

It is not the saccharine-sweet pat on the back like Spielberg&#8217;s Lincoln or anything warm-fuzzy like Roots. Steve McQueen has hit his third home run in a row with this gritty, haunting story of American cruelty.In some ways, it almost reminded me of Pasolini&#8217;s Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom in how it showed the cruelty humanity can put up with, or even commit, in order to survive. It is just as painful to watch the enslaved Solomon Northup be whipped and beaten as it is to watch him do nothing as the same happens to victims around him.On a broader level, it&#8217;s fascinating how these characters create a sense of order for themselves, in a world so full of cruelty and chaos. Almost everyone speaks in beautiful, nearly-Shakespearean language, heightening the sheer intelligence and thought everyone has put into how they face their often desperate circumstances. Whether Michael Fassbender as Edwin Epps practicing horrific cruelty believing such is God&#8217;s will, or Chiwetel Ejiofor defending his master William Ford as a good one &#8220;under the circumstances,&#8221; it&#8217;s illuminating to see how these characters warp their realities in order to live through them.McQueen takes no emotional cheap shots, or force any sentimentality or remorse out of it. Your guttural response is from merely the actions, as the camera is forcing you to witness them for yourself. No artistic work I&#8217;ve yet seen shows the condition of slavery as horrifyingly as 12 Years a Slave.It&#8217;s not easy to watch but I&#8217;d consider it almost essential viewing.

1677109,A2I7NGKA8LPN89,B00G4Q3KOC,Stacy Hackney (formerly customerS),"[1, 2]","Film could've been stronger. There were parts I liked and parts I didn't.What I liked: the generally believable way slavery is presented here in that the story shows some of the costs of slavery to the slave. I give the film 3 and 1/2 stars for it's generally honest representation of slavery and for including the stories of the woman who lost her two young children, and the woman who was repeatedly raped and abused by her masters.Acting was good.Disliked:(1) Overly formal sounding dialogue, almost as if the film is a play.(2) Initially overly emotional score, before the story had even properly begun. After Solomon is kidnapped and beaten, the story caught up with the score and it worked well enough for me.(3) Solomon and his family aren't well written and are too bland, and in the coda when he's reunited with them, little sense of who he or his family are as people.  They are a cardboard middle class african american family - no spark, nothing interesting. The guts of the story is Solomon's slavery experience and it is horrible, but I would've liked to know who he is as a person, not just who he is as a slave. The writer of Fruitvale Station did a much better job presenting a multifaceted character than the writer did here. Because Solomon is so poorly written, didn't believe that he spoke up against his master as his master brutally beat the slave woman who left the plantation to get soap - felt abit Hollywoody, which means it was not properly written, not set up well. Should've had Solomon say nothing and wretch and cry; that would've been more believable, though not as heroic. Better yet, should've gotten a better writer, someone who can write set-ups.(4) Shopkeeper unbelievable - when Solomon and his family are shopping the shopkeeper treats him excessively well. To make that work, writer should've shown that Solomon is especially indulgent in presenting gifts to his wife/children, which he purchases from this particular shopkeeper and is therefore a very good customer for the shopkeeper. As the story doesn't show this, shopkeeper's behavior sticks out as an ""why is he behaving that way,"" especially given Solomon/family are african american, the shopkeeper is caucasian, this is well before the Emancipation Proclamation and african american men are hanged routinely, and not just in the south: blatant racism is rife. If such politeness is important to the filmmaker, he should've shown a reason for it.I experience significant racism now though I am not at all racist myself, so it must've been beyond hell for people of color in the 19th century, even in ""free"" states. It should be noted that Solomon went missing again some years after his rescue. It's quite possible that he was murdered, considering the book he wrote, the fact that he attempted unsuccessfully to have the men who initially imprisoned him punished, and that post-freedom he worked trying to free other enslaved people - any one of those behaviors could've easily gotten him killed, though the facts surrounding his death are unknown.About the masters's behavior, what can I say except many haven't changed: humans, though capable of kindness, beauty and love, are the most brutal and cruel animals on the planet, and many insist we're not animals but God's chosen ones - yeah, right. a mindset very similar to that of the film's masters.  We have been extremely evolutionarily blessed, but many don't believe in evolution. So no, many haven't changed, some are more cunning, is all.  For proof,  look no further than how we treat our food animals. I fervently wish we were better creatures. Many of us strive to do the right thing, but many of us don't. This will bite us.(5) Alfre Woodard as a ""power"" slave doesn't work for me. This is the second major film I've seen relatively recently featuring American slavery where the writer went out of his way to show there were some slaves who made the best of their situation, to the point of thriving, and these relatively powerful slaves were portrayed by noted african american actors. (The other is Samuel L. Jackson in Django.) Historically, no doubt some slaves did the best they could with their situation, but it's interesting that Hollywood chooses to place noted, very strong, actors in these parts, and that the stories feature in some measure the power slave's story and more importantly, their power. Suggests (to me) that Hollywood is saying slaves who were cunning enough could outmaneuver their masters. Yeah, right.I don't mind that power slaves are included in slave stories, but I question why their power positions are featured in these stories and cast with amongst the best african american actors. By featuring these powerful slave characters and casting them with top talent, the films, to me, gain a disingenuous, propaganda-ish, revisionist, feel - as if Hollywood is suggesting that a class of african americans benefited from American slavery, just as caucasians did.A similar type of argument would be a Holocaust film where within all the evil, terror, and misery of the concentration camps, gas chambers and starvation, a pretty, female Jewish slave was featured living large in the private apartments of an SS concentration camp officer. She'd dress well and have Jewish slaves attending her. Yes, no doubt there were Jewish women who were kept as sex slaves, but how abhorrent if a film about the massacres at the camps featured a smug, well nourished Jewish woman, dining with a few of her friends and gossiping in the officer's apartments, while people are being lead to the gas chambers.Such a portrayal would be untrue because such a woman would be a sex slave and her ""power"" would be limited to that apartment. To suggest by the story that she benefits from the Holocaust would be a travesty, given that she is a slave, less than a slave: she is a woman staving off death by acquiescing to rape. Because she is allowed to bathe and dress nicely simply means the officer doesn't want a stinky woman in his bed. If a storyteller featured her ""power"" by showing her boss around the Jewish slaves ordered to assist her, or by gossiping and bragging with her friends (other sex slaves to other SS officers) that she has the SS officer wrapped around her little finger, it's reasonable to ask why a filmmaker is showing such a characterization. It works if the filmmaker shows that the character is mentally unstable, or base or ignorant, but if the character is not treated as such, there is a problem for me. No sane, emotionally stable person wants to be a slave. Which is why I dislike the smug, bragging, power slave as portrayed by Alfre Woodard (Ms. Woodard is a wonderful actress, no disrespect meant towards her). In my opinion, the filmmakers suggest that because she is relatively successful, that slavery benefits her; her dialogue clearly suggests that she's running with it. While, in my opinion, what she is actually doing, given that she is property, is making her life as bearable as she can.  I'm not sure why the filmmakers have her bragging, but it doesn't work for me. Power slaves, especially when acted by well known african american actors being featured in a story reveling in their power, are a problem for me because of what I intuit the filmmaker is saying with the character and with the casting.  Lastly, in my opinion, given that American racism has a large bias against darker skin and kinky hair texture, it would've been more believable had a light skinned, smooth haired actress played the power slave.In conclusion, because Solomon's characterization is so poorly executed, story doesn't really work for me. The only story I can recall where an african american male character has been victimized but the writer is gifted enough to make him a believable, vibrant, flawed, multifaceted character (in addition to showing his victimization) is Fruitvale Station. Solomon should've been better written. The masters in this film are better, more clearly written than Solomon. For example, the slaveowner wife is jealous. Her jealousy makes her cruel, evil, spiteful, vindictive and cunning. Her behavior is deeply unattractive, but recognizable.Who is Solomon? What is his character, his nature? Does he drink, cheat on his wife, is he incautious, stupid, in debt and therefore so quick to make a buck that he goes off with slavers masquerading as musicians in a time when it is well known that free african americans are kidnapped and sold into slavery in slave states?  Why doesn't the caucasian men's generosity throw off alarm bells? Is he naive? And if so, why? Is he jealous of his wife, competitive with her? He and his family dress well, does he like to showboat? In a time when african american men are routinely lynched, why is Solomon so unafraid of the caucasian strangers he meets? He hasn't been a slave, but his father had. Solomon is an african american man in a country where most african american men are slaves and yet his behavior doesn't reflect his reality. Why? Showing the audience why would've added a richness and depth to the story that is lacking. Solomon's kidnapping is not his fault, but why is he so ignorant of his world? As written, he's just an african american family man who is kidnapped, I know little more about him than that, which is not a strong enough characterization.In my opinion, whatever the story, whatever happens to the character, they themselves should be interesting enough to carry their own weight, to justify their inclusion in the story. They needn't be perfect, just recognizable, and their situation, their predicament, needs to be recognizable. We judge them against their predicament, and against how we'd react in their situation. If the character and their situation isn't recognizable, the audience won't care what happens to them.At the end of this film, the audience still doesn't know who Solomon is. That isn't the actor's fault, it's the writer's responsibility to know what the audience needs in order to emotionally attach us to the character. The more situations where the character's nature is revealed, the more surface area the audience has to attach to the character. The writer must create the revelatory situations as the story moves along: the revelatory situations are the story. If a writer doesn't know how to do it, study I Love Lucy episodes, look at Star Wars and see how George Lucas attaches us to Luke, to the droids, to Obiwan. View Fruitvale Station. How does that writer make a lying, cheating character appealing? Obviously not by making him blameless or bland. Look at well-loved characters and try and figure out how the writer makes us love them. In my opinion, this is an essential skill for a screenwriter. The screenwriter here didn't do as well as I would've liked. Hopefully he/she will improve.",3,"Revisionism? 2nd recent Hollywood film I've seen featuring American slavery where a smug ""power"" slave thrives despite all odds",1394841600,"03 15,

1677115,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,B00G4Q3KOC,Steve Douglas,"[2, 5]","So many have already provided summaries of this film, opinions upon the great acting, historical accuracy and even racial bias, so I will refrain from being redundant and focus solely upon the actual quality of the film on Blu Ray.  It is rare that I would ever buy a film I had not seen elsewhere either on TV or in the theaters but I knew that I had to own this one and I am glad that I took the chance.Keep in mind that the quality of what you see and hear also depends upon the quality of TV monitor you are using and its accompanying home theater processor and speakers. I have a pretty high end, esoteric system and am judging the Blu Ray off of that.VIDEO.....The video imaging on Blu Ray is absolutely excellent.  Colors for both skin and environment are very accurate with no false saturation or smoothing that I could notice.  Small details are clearly discerned in the grass, in the hair and throughout the film.  While the blacks did not appear to go very deep details in shadow areas are nicely present.  The Mbps rate appeared to average in the high 30's and low 40's depending upon the amount of action in the scene itself.  At no point was there any artifacting or imaging issues. Contrast was good but not overly sharpened and general resolution was superior to most BR's that i have seen or owned.AUDIO....The audio is a lossless DTS 5.1 soundtrack with volume settings just as they should be.  Whispers can be heard, and dialogue is clear and transparent.  The surrounds are used primarily for environmental ambience.  While there is some discreet usage of the surround speakers and some panning between the stages left and right, do not expect as much as I think there could have been.  Your LFE channel has not much work at all to do as there really is no low bass.  Where the audio track really shines is when the slaves are singing in the fields, then the audio becomes most immersive as if you were there.  Great choice of field songs and not the same ones that come to mind when you think of the old gospel singing associated with films of this nature.I know that, for many, this film could be very difficult to sit through.  Back in the 70's when Roots first appeared, that was difficult as well.  Both films do the subject justice in every way.EXTRAS....There is a single documentary on the making, shooting and casting of the film.  This doc is split into two parts to make you think you are getting more for the money.  You aren't.  Never the less, the documentary is really well done and interesting and a big step above many of the 'Making of' documentaries found on DVD and BR.  There are two other short docs on the 'music score' and the team of people who contributed to the film.There are also a few trailers for other movies....I do not think that these trailers are 'extras'.  They just force you to pay for the companies advertising and take up more room on the Blu Ray disc calling for even more compression of the film you are paying for.There is also a digital download which I have not tried to do as yet.I do hope that this review has been of some HELP to you in deciding your purchase. All my reviews focus solely upon the quality of the actual disc and not redundant summaries and acting opinions.Thanks for reading.",5,12 Years a Slave on Blu Ray...a must see.,1395964800,"03 28, 2014",2014,3261,"['So', 'many', 'have', 'already', 'provided', 'summaries', 'film', 'opinions', 'great', 'acting', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'even', 'racial', 'bias', 'will', 'refrain', 'being', 'redundant', 'focus', 'solely', 'actual', 'quality', 'film', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'rare', 'would', 'ever', 'buy', 'film', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'elsewhere', 'either', 'TV', 'theaters', 'knew', 'had', 'own', 'one', 'am', 'glad', 'took', 'chance.Keep', 'mind', 'quality', 'what', 'see', 'hear', 'also', 'quality', 'TV', 'monitor', 'are', 'using', 'accompanying', 'home', 'theater', 'processor', 'speakers', 'have', 'pretty', 'high', 'end', 'esoteric', 'system', 'am', 'judging', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'that.VIDEO', '..The', 'video', 'imaging', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'absolutely', 'excellent', 'Colors', 'skin', 'environment', 'are', 'very', 'accurate', 'false', 'saturation', 'smoothing', 'could', 'notice', 'Small', 'details', 'are', 'clearly', 'discerned', 'grass', 'hair', 'film', 'blacks', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'go', 'very', 'deep', 'details', 'shadow', 'areas', 'are', 'nicely', 'present', 'Mbps', 'rate', 'appeared', 'average', 'high', '30', 'low', '40', 'depending', 'amount', 'action', 'scene', 'point', 'was', 'artifacting', 'imaging', 'issues', 'Contrast', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'overly', 'sharpened', 'general', 'resolution', 'was', 'superior', 'most', 'BR', 'i', 'have', 'seen', '.The', 'audio', 'lossless', 'DTS', '5.1', 'soundtrack', 'volume', 'settings', 'just', 'should', 'be', 'Whispers', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'dialogue', 'clear', 'transparent', 'surrounds', 'are', 'used', 'primarily', 'environmental', 'ambience', 'discreet', 'usage', 'surround', 'speakers', 'panning', 'stages', 'left', 'right', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'as', 'much', 'think', 'there', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'LFE', 'channel', 'not', 'much', 'work', 'do', 'really', 'low', 'bass', 'Where', 'audio', 'track', 'really', 'shines', 'when', 'slaves', 'are', 'singing', 'fields', 'then', 'audio', 'most', 'immersive', 'were', 'there', 'Great', 'choice', 'field', 'songs', 'not', 'same', 'ones', 'come', 'mind', 'when', 'think', 'old', 'gospel', 'singing', 'associated', 'films', 'nature.I', 'know', 'many', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'difficult', 'sit', 'Back', '70', 'when', 'Roots', 'first', 'appeared', 'was', 'difficult', 'as', 'well', 'films', 'do', 'subject', 'justice', 'way.EXTRAS', 'single', 'documentary', 'making', 'shooting', 'casting', 'film', 'doc', 'split', 'two', 'parts', 'make', 'think', 'are', 'getting', 'more', 'money', 'are', ""n't"", 'Never', 'less', 'documentary', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'interesting', 'big', 'step', 'many', ""'Making"", 'documentaries', 'found', 'DVD', 'BR', 'are', 'two', 'other', 'short', 'docs', ""'music"", 'score', 'team', 'people', 'who', 'contributed', 'film.There', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'trailers', 'other', 'movies', '.I', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'trailers', 'are', ""'extras"", 'just', 'force', 'pay', 'companies', 'advertising', 'take', 'up', 'more', 'room', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'disc', 'calling', 'even', 'more', 'compression', 'film', 'are', 'paying', 'for.There', 'also', 'digital', 'download', 'have', 'not', 'tried', 'do', 'yet.I', 'do', 'hope', 'review', 'been', 'HELP', 'deciding', 'purchase', 'reviews', 'focus', 'solely', 'quality', 'actual', 'disc', 'not', 'redundant', 'summaries', 'acting', 'opinions.Thanks', 'reading']",12 Years a Slave

1677120,A26MJME9IBNETY,B00G4Q3KOC,StrangePegs,"[6, 12]","12 Years a Slave is possibly the most brutal movie about slavery I've ever seen. It's unflinching in its portrayal of the inhumanity involved in selling slaves and the attitude of them being nothing more than just, basically, livestock. This is summed up no better than a line delivered by Mistress Ford to a female slave just separated from her children, &#34;You'll forget about your children soon enough,&#34; as if she was a dog being separated from her pups. Of course, Eliza did not forget about her children.However, as brutal as the film is, it is very much detached from the emotion of the things that are happening in most circumstances. You see the horror, but you don't really feel it. In that, it's almost like watching a documentary. It's more clinical than visceral, a drawback for a movie like this, and I'm not sure what causes the disconnect. It's not a lack in the quality of the acting.Chiwetel Ejiofor does a great job of bewilderment after he's kidnapped at the beginning of the movie. He make us believe in the unreality of his situation. At least, it's unreal from his perspective. Solomon Northup was, after all, born a free man and the idea that he's been taken into slavery is a bit beyond his conception. The problem, I think, with the movie overall is that Ejiofor never really seems to believe in the situation he's in. It's as if every moment he's waiting to wake up, and that may have been what made me feel removed from the action of the movie. I'm not sure that's all of it, but I know that's some of it.Michael Fassbender, on the other hand, is completely &#34;within&#34; his character, Edwin Epps. Fassbender is not someone I've thought much of as an actor thus far. Not that I've thought he was bad, he's just been someone I've mostly shrugged off as, &#34;eh, what's the big deal?&#34; But he did a great job as Epps. He was completely believable as cruel and erratic. And Sarah Paulson, who played his wife, was wonderful(ly horrible) as his cold, bitter wife.Many of the other actors were also quite good in their smaller roles. Giamatti, Cumberbatch, and Pitt were more than adequate, but their roles didn't require anything more of them than to be the kind of characters they frequently are. Pitt, in particular, seems to have chosen hos role specifically (he did produce it) to deliver the message he wanted to deliver, and he fit well in that part. Paul Dano was also quite good. Actually, Dano is good enough that I always have a hard time remembering who he is when I see him on screen. He seems to gravitate toward parts that are kind of slimy, but he fits so well into them, that he mostly disappears.The most unsatisfactory part of the movie, though (and this is kind of spoilery, but, if you have any grasp of racial history in the United States, it shouldn't be anything unexpected or surprising), is the bad guys go unpunished. Of course, this is because the bad guys went unpunished, so it's more that it's an unsatisfactory part of history; no fault of the movie. It does, however, stir up feelings over the injustice of how Northup was treated. That's actually a positive aspect of the movie, because you should feel that Northup was treated unjustly. He was treated unjustly.It was a good movie but not one that I felt was great. There's almost no way it won't get a best picture nomination, but I don't think it's going to win. I don't think it ought to win. From a movie standpoint, it was just missing... something. Something ineffable, I guess. That doesn't make it a movie you shouldn't see, though.

I am now reading the book which I bought from Amazon and half way through am delighted to report the movie was faithful.  I think the movie was more impactful due to the graphic scenes.  The crimes that occurred to the women slaves were a necessary part of the movie understanding why more so from the book.  I watched and learned how truly horrible slavery was and feel my American History schooling did me no justice. In the book Solomon told of not being able to empathize since not being a slave yourself which ultimately changed.

1677142,A2LHMP07OFU6JW,B00G4Q3KOC,Texas Reader,"[19, 27]","12 years a slave is a true story about a man named Solomon Northup.  He was a free black man in the North who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the South.  This movie is based on the book he wrote back in 1853 under the same title.  The movie has caused a reemergence of sales for the book, which, until recently, had been forgotten.  The movie flows fairly well and is definitely a must watch film if you are interested in topics such as African American history and slavery in America.Be warned that the film has some graphic scenes of violence.  These include whipping scenes where whipping someone causes the flesh to be severed from their back and there are scenes of lynchings as well.  Obviously, they are necessary scenes to show the brutality of slavery at that time in history.  They are sprinkled throughout the film and can easily be forwarded if you decide to buy the DVD.The story moves by quickly after the first 15 minutes of the film.  It does not drag at all.  The film is about two hours and fifteen minutes long, but you will not know it.  The story is told in a very linear fashion and is easy to follow.  My only problem with the film was, during a lynching scene, a heavy metal guitar rift is the chosen music for the scene.  I thought for the period, it seemed out of place.  Obviously, it is no reason to take a star off for just that.I think the film is very important to serve as a counterbalance to films such as Birth of a Nation and Gone with the Wind.  Those films show slaves being content as slaves, while films such as 12 Years a Slave show the brutality of slavery as well as the hardships faced by the slaves.  It is always good to have more than one side telling the story.In terms of the graphic portrayals of slavery, I would have to rate this film as fairly tame compared to movies which discussed the topic of slavery back in the 70's.  Drum, Mandingo, Mandinga, and, of course, Goodbye Uncle Tom were way more graphic.  In fact, I would go as far as to say that they are very difficult films to watch.  What those films do not offer is the fact that 12 Years a Slave is told by an actual person who lived through the difficult ordeal.I can easily rate this as a five star film.

1677151,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B00G4Q3KOC,The People's Critic,"[4, 9]","There&#8217;s a moment towards the end of 12 Years a Slave where Solomon (Chiwetel Ejiofor) looks directly into the camera and seemingly at the audience.  He stares for an extended moment, as if to say, &#8220;Can you believe that only 150 years ago &#8211; this happened&#8230;in the United States of America?&#8221;  12 Years a Slave is the quintessential American slavery-era film; it is heartbreaking, disturbing, tender, raw, and also beautiful.Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Solomon Northrup, a free, New York citizen who is a victim of a horrific kidnapping scheme where Southern slave traders abduct free Black citizens and transport them South forcing them back into slavery.  Northup&#8217;s life and family are ripped from him so suddenly that it is astonishing.  The title is pragmatically evocative of how long Northrup will endure his injustice, and director Steve McQueen makes sure the audience feels every bit of it as well.The film is based on Northrup&#8217;s own memoir, a literary example preciously rare as so many slaves died before they could tell their stories or were never taught to read and write.  A pervasive struggle Northrup faces in the film is searching for tools or opportunities to write.  The film opens with Northrup covertly trying to make ink out of blackberry juice and fashion a pen out of stray twigs.  McQueen wisely emphasizes the oppressive silencing that occurred in order to, in some way, try to explain how such outrageousness was even possible for so long.McQueen frames Northrup&#8217;s experience by casting recognizable faces as various archetypes of 19th Century Southern society.  Paul Giamatti plays a slave merchant in all of its absurdity, Benedict Cumberbatch plays the hypocritical plantation owner who seemingly appreciates humanity but wants to turn his eyes from the horror he knows is happening right under his nose, and Brad Pitt plays&#8230;Jesus; I&#8217;m pretty sure he&#8217;s playing Jesus.  However, one player, other than Ejiofor, gets to sink his teeth into a role that is far more substantial, Michael Fassbender.  Fassbender plays Edwin Epps, a slave owner who owns Northrup for nearly 10 of his 12 years in slavery.  Fassbender is terrifying; his character is reminiscent of Ralph Fiennes&#8217; character in Schindler&#8217;s List, yes &#8211; he&#8217;s that chilling.  However, what sets him apart from being a typical embodiment of evil is that as the film goes on, it is clear that Epps is mentally ill.  This element does not garner sympathy for his actions, but it does reveal some of the helplessness inherent in a society that avoids the value of human life.  The end result is a decaying infrastructure that eats away at itself until it collapses.Of course, this is a showcase for Chiwetel Ejiofor, an actor who has been on the brink of greatness for some time now.  Ejiofor&#8217;s performance is certainly in the running for the best of the year.  He harnesses strength as he portrays the effects of a dark and obtuse time in human history.  As Solomon Northrup, he leads the audience through a series of events that certainly require a bold and fearless guide.12 Years a Slave is a moody masterpiece that I&#8217;m sure offers more context in repeat viewings, but I don&#8217;t know what kind of person would be able to sit through this film more than once.  McQueen contrasts the most abhorrent events of our young country&#8217;s history with some beautiful filmmaking, glorifying the Southern landscapes in rich, luscious irony.  His camera is up close and personal, using countless close-ups with the clear objective of putting slavery &#8220;in your face.&#8221;  The emotion is real and raw, not melodramatic.  Towards the end of the film, Northrup finally breaks down, which is inevitable.  He weeps for what he has missed.  It is a history lesson of the best and worst kind.

1677154,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B00G4Q3KOC,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[6, 13]","This wasn't a film that I'd longed to see. I guess I may have feared that it was another ""ethnic/racial"" appeal, thing, which, alas, I'd suspected years ago ofAmistad, the quality of which, then, impressed me.But, a week ago I attended, with professional colleagues, a tour, led by two colleagues who tend to Southern sympathies. One of them--a good friend, but one who refers to the conflict of the 1860s as ""The War of Southern Independence""--resents objections to revisionism that pervades Confederate history in these days of the anniversary of, particularly, Gettysburg.Then, coincidentally, this week I began a book which I'd purchased some time ago,The N Word: Who Can Say It, Who Shouldn't, and Why, which eloquently describes some of the roots of the more extreme racist elements of our society.(An aside, I'm also in the middle ofTime Travel in Einstein's Universe: The Physical Possibilities of Travel Through Time, but that relates more to the directorial technique of director Steve McQueen. More in a moment).One thing I learned on that tour last week is that I think it was 1808 the import of slaves became illegal. Wheeling and dealing in human contraband was legal inside the US, but one could no longer import them. Thus, something I hadn't thought of which the film exposed: kidnapping of ""free men"" to the slave market, still another shameful item on the menu of slavery in the US.Solomon Northrup (Chiwetel Ejiofor, a Londoner born of Nigerian parents), who wrote the book on which the film is based, is a fiddler in New York state in the 1840s. He's affluent, well-respected, and talented. He has a spouse and family, a demographic of whom we don't hear much in US history classes. He's approached by some circus hucksters with a show-biz opportunity. What happens next isn't perfectly clear, but maybe that's part of the film's magic. In a nutshell, he's abducted, finds himself imprisoned and whipped; he insists that he's a ""free man,"" and his oppressors torture him.While being shipped with a few other kidnap victims to the slave market, the abductees discuss any potential escape attempts. They agree that if they are exposed as literate, educated, far more sophisticated than their captors, they would be killed. When one of the three discussing, Robert (Michael Kenneth Williams,The Wire,Boardwalk Empire) challenges a crew member about to molest one of the kidnapped, is knifed and thrown overboard. So much for escape attempts.Solomon is given the name ""Platt"" and becomes ever more submissive through his role. When he challenges one ""master,"" under the plantation owner Mr. Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch,Star Trek Into Darkness) who is sympathetic to ""Platt,"" there is an attempt to lynch Solomon. For what appears to be a few days, he's hanging, barely able to breath, until Mr. Ford frees him, then sends him on to a horribly oppressive master, Mr. Epps, played almost too well, by Michael Fassbender (Prometheus,A Dangerous Method).Epps was a great manifestation of some elements of ""The N Word"" to which I already referred; he rationalized his own desire for one of the slaves, Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o, ""Shuga"") as her fault. His spouse, played by Sarah Paulson (Game Change, ""American Horror Story""), is resentful of the attention he gives to Patsey. So to prove his allegiance to her, she demands that her husband be especially cruel to Patsey. That demand, coupled with his own resentment, lead to horrifying scenes.And an element for which the film is award-worthy: the make-up describing the lashings the slaves endured.As much detail as I'd love to cover, I'm afraid of ""giving things away"" so I'll avoid the detail. But why my reference to time travel? It's been sort of a Hollywood trend for some time now to reflect on the past in too many films; you see what's happening, then you'll see something which led to the scene you're seeing. It can become what borders on clich&eacute;. But I thought director McQueen (an African American, not the one we remember from years ago;Shame) did so better than all too many films these days.And ""reflection"" was an important element of the film, so appropriate to the screenplay.There were some slow, ponderous scenes which almost had me on the edge of my seat. Is something going to happen and I'm going to jump? Some of them reminded me of Stanley Kubrick's style, especially in Eyes Wide Shut. But that's an aside (added, to be honest, after I'd submitted the original review).At the end, there are some descriptions of the results of trials, etc., related to Solomon's case, which is based on what really happened. It's not a novel. I won't give them away, but I'll provide a hint: Solomon was black. The jury was not.I do believe this one will be prone to various awards this year, including, I hope, those to Ejiofor and Fassbender, an McQueen. And it's an important--VERY important--element of US history. We tend to romanticize slavery, even those of our founders who owned slaves. This fine film shows an element of that trade of which I was not even aware.Don't miss it. But don't expect soft pedaling, and fun for the family.",5,"Historical, and elements of slavery we must not minimize or forget",1385251200,"11 24, 2013",2013,5118,"['was', ""n't"", 'film', ""'d"",

1677160,A1XT8AJB7S9JJG,B00G4Q3KOC,Tony Heck,"[1, 2]","&#34;My name is Solomon Northrup. I'm a free man.&#34; Solomon Northrup (Ejiofor) is a free man living in the north in the year 1841. One night he meets two men who offer to take him out for a drink and talk about business. When he wakes up the next morning he finds himself chained to the floor. Before he realizes what is happening to him he is shipped to the south and sold into slavery. When his new owner Edwin Epps (Fassbender) starts to break him down Solomon does everything he can to stay strong and fight for his survival and hope for freedom again. I'll start by saying before I watched this movie all I heard was that it should win Best Picture at the Oscars. So I was looking forward to watching this even though I expected it to be brutal and hard to watch in some parts. About halfway through I was left wondering what all the hype was about. The movie, to me at least, seemed very slow and boring. To me this a perfect example of a movie that makes you feel guilty for not liking it. The movie deals with a very important and serious part of history but the movie was really nothing more then look how bad slavery was, over and over. On one hand watching what Solomon goes through is gut wrenching and knowing its a true story makes it that much more powerful. On the other hand when the movie is over and you find out about the rest of his life I couldn't help but thinking if they would have done those events it would have been a better movie. This is not a terrible movie but I thought it was very overrated. Overall, one of the most important movies of the year in terms of subject, but that is different from being the Best Picture of the year.

The film is most effective when these techniques are least conspicuous.What makes the film so intense is the excellent performances from Chiwetel Ejiofor as the protagonist Solomon Northup and Lupita Nyong'o as the female slave Patsey.

1677167,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00G4Q3KOC,Turfseer,"[8, 14]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***If there is one parallel between Director Steve McQueen's powerful adaptation of Solomon Northrup's 1853 memoir, '12 Years a Slave', and Spielberg's 'Schindler's List', it's that both are told from the perspective of survivors. Both are exceptions to the rule: in Schindler's list, the 1500 or so Jews who were saved by a German businessmen, of course do not represent the fate of their 6 million co-religionists who were exterminated by the Nazis; and similarly, Northrup was only a handful of kidnapped freedmen turned slaves, who was heard from again. In a sense, the survivor's tale mitigates the horrors somewhat. While the survivor does not represent what happened to the majority, at least the audience can identify with the exceptional rescue --in this way, we can all feel that there's at least some hope, despite all the surrounding darkness.Having read some excerpts from the book the film is based on, it appears that this is a very thorough, truthful adaptation of Solomon Northurp's original account. Director Steve McQueen already established himself as a master of the visual medium in his disappointing, fictional effort, 'Shame', but here, dealing with a compelling true story, McQueen is finally able to shine.The film begins with Northrup already in captivity and we soon flashback to his almost idyllic existence as family man/musician in 1841 Saratoga, New York. The inciting incident of course is his kidnapping after he's conned and drugged by men who misrepresent themselves as businessmen who are in need of a musician to play a limited engagement in Washington, D.C. The break into the Second Act, which constitutes the beginning of Northrup's nightmare, is when he's sold into slavery down in New Orleans. The scene is doubly horrifying as Northrup witnesses the separation of two children from their mother, who are all sold into slavery.The first half of Act II features heightening tension as Northrup is sold to a relatively kind plantation owner, William Ford, who treats him decently and even gives him a violin as a present. Ford recognizes that Northrup is educated (without questioning where he got his education) and allows him to assist in engineering a waterway for transporting logs downstream. Nonetheless, the plantation overseer, the brutal racist Tibeats, resents his boss' special treatment of Northrup. Things come to a head when Northrup beats Tibeats up after the arch racist provokes him. Northrup is tied up and almost lynched but is prevented by the head overseer, who tells Tibeats he can't kill Northrup because Ford will lose his original $400 investment. The big revelation is that even though Ford 'owns' Northrup, he is unable to prevent Tibeats from taking revenge and settles on selling Northrup to another plantation owner, the even more brutal Edwin Epps.Epps is a religious fundamentalist who reads Bible passages to his slaves but also beats them whenever he's in the mood. He's also a hypocrite, as he's sexually infatuated with a young slave, Patsey, who he rapes and will not stop, despite his wife's constant entreaties. The jealous wife takes out all her hatred on poor Patsey too; in one powerful scene, she offers treats to all the slaves, except Patsey, who she strikes in the head in front of her husband, and a horrified Northrup and his fellow slaves.The dark moment of Act II occurs when Patsey obtains a bar of soap from a neighboring plantation at the time when Epps is looking for her. Epps has her stripped and orders Northrup to whip her. When Northrup doesn't whip Patsey full force, Epps takes over and delivers a horrendous beating.Northrup's deliverance occurs in Act III when he meets Bass, a carpenter, who's doing a job for Epps and has abolitionist sentiments. Northrup is reluctant to tell Bass his story since earlier he was betrayed by a white worker on the plantation, after he attempts to convince the man to mail a letter for him, to alert his family and friends in New York. Northrup finally decides to trust Bass and things are set in motion, which leads to his freedom. Perhaps the only real weak spot in this gripping saga is the casting of Brad Pitt as Bass. Pitt is one of the producers of the films and obviously he wanted to get in on the action. But we're too familiar with him as Brad Pitt to believe that this is a 19th century benefactor. An unknown actor here, would have added much more to the film's verisimilitude.Chiwetel Ejiofor is excellent in the role of Northrup as he echoes the original author's restrained dignity. Now with a great story to work with, Steve McQueen, has delivered one of the best depictions of the antebellum South to date. The film is a great antidote to those who still yearn for the phony story of the south as depicted in films such as 'Gone With the World'. I wouldn't be surprised if '12 days a Slave' won the Oscar for both Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Director at this year's upcoming Academy Awards.",5,Powerful and gripping adaptation of 1853

1677168,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00G4Q3KOC,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","I first heard of Solomon Northup about 17 years ago when I read excerpts from his memoir, 12 YEARS A SLAVE, in an American literature class in college. I vaguely remember being appalled by some of what Northup and his companions were forced to endure and I was even more upset by the realization that Northup&#8217;s trials and tribulations were typical and tame by some standards at the time. I don&#8217;t like admitting it, but until the movie 12 YEARS A SLAVE was released, I hadn&#8217;t thought anything about Solomon Northup since that college class.Solomon Northup was a free-black who lived in Saratoga Springs, New York. He was a talented violinist who supported himself doing various labor jobs during the dry periods of music playing. In 1841 while his wife and children were away working for a wealthy family, Northup was tricked and kidnapped by two traveling con-men slave traders and sold into slavery in Washington, D.C. He was chained, beaten, and broken and given the new name of &#8220;Platt.&#8221; He was eventually sold to slaveholders in Louisiana and for 12 years lived as a slave until his true identity was eventually revealed and he was rescued from his plight.12 YEARS A SLAVE is a magnificent piece of cinema. The acting is superb, particular the performances of Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon and Lupita Nyong&#8217;o as Patsey. The cinematography is beautiful and the direction of the film well executed. The vivid brutality and violence are contrasted with images of the lush and beautiful natural scenery of the South. The contrast is stark and augments the power of the story told on the screen.The movie provides a real and raw look at the horrors of slavery in the United States. Living in the world we do, it&#8217;s easy to forget or not even realize how brutal and horrific slavery was. However, it was probably the darkest blight that ever existed upon the collective conscious of the country&#8217;s moral fiber. As Samuel Bass (Brad Pitt) says, &#8220;There&#8217;s a sin, a fearful sin, resting on this nation, that will not go unpunished forever. There will be a reckoning yet&#8212;yes, Epps, there&#8217;s a day coming that will burn as an oven. It may be sooner or it may be later, but it&#8217;s a coming as sure as the Lord is just.&#8221; That sin was slavery and 12 YEARS A SLAVE is a vivid example at just how horrible a sin it was.12 YEARS A SLAVE is a powerful film.

After seeing the movie, I did some more research and am now more acquainted with Solomon Northup and his terrible journey.

1677170,AZ4IUCJHXTUBD,B00G4Q3KOC,"uni aum Entertainment ""uni aum Entertainment""","[11, 19]","2013 British-American film adaptation of the 1853 memoir 12 Years a Slave, Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor, Dirty Pretty Things), a New York State-born free negro who was kidnapped in Washington, D.C. in 1841 and sold into slavery. He worked on plantations in Louisiana for twelve years before his release.The movie seems to want to realistically depict the United States' greatest failing: the horrors of centuries of slavery as accurately as Alex Haley's ROOTS had in the 1970s. The movie starkly displayed the sights and sounds of enslavement - from slaves picking cotton as they sang in the fields, to the crack of the lash on a person's back.But some liberties with the realism may have been taken. Shortly after Northup is kidnapped, when on a ship bound south, a sailor who has entered the hold is about to rape a slave woman when a male slave intervenes. The sailor stabs and kills him which is unlikely - slaves were valuable, and the sailor is not the owner. The scene is not in the book.The ideology behind enslavement is clearly present. Masters such as William Ford (portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch) and Edwin Epps, both use an interpretation of Christianity to justify their ownership of slaves. They believed the Bible sanctioned slavery, and that it was their `Christian duty' to preach the scriptures to their slaves.Of slave-master William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch), who in the memoir Northup said, ""There never was a more kind, noble, candid, Christian man than William Ford,"" adding that Ford's circumstances ""blinded [Ford] to the inherent wrong at the bottom of the system of Slavery."" But even under the best conditions, the movie never loses sight of Northup's being property, which his well-being and life are at the whim of his owners.The movie's power and flaws lies in the unsettling details and psychological contortions slavery inflicts on everyone involved, black and white. The film shows Ford as not wanting to have to be placed in a position of having to challenge the justness of slavery. Circumstances force his ownership to be transformed to a brutal master (Michael Fassbender). Each scene here shows how psychotic life in the pre-Civil War era would appear to the modern mind.Any northerner who's visited the south knows that a southerner recognizes a northern accent. Why doesn't anyone ever recognize Solomon's? In fact, when he's first abducted, someone proclaims how southern he is. In slavery time: an educated, free Negro did not speak distinctly different from an uneducated slave? Wouldn't everyone always tell Solomon rather than him having to proclaim, you must know I'm different?Although portraying an admirable character, Brad Pitt's line delivery is as wooden as the structure he builds. No one was in charge of continuity? How huge the wooden frame was [the size of a 2-story house] yet the finished gazebo is so small.Sarah Paulson is so perfect as the jealous mistress of plantation that only contempt can be felt for her. Character actor Paul Giamatti is so at home portraying a slave-trader that it felt as though it was a repeat performance for him.Alfre Woodard appeared to have fun portraying a slave who's gained a position of comfort as a mistress. Is it realistic to believe that Pasty (Lupita Nyong'o) and Solomon would not resent and loathe her haughty entitlement as her life appears stark contrast to their degradation?Thomas Jefferson wrote that all negroes (being negro) smelled bad; would any people who were denied to bathe regularly be able to smell their own ""bad"" smell? Patsy is to be believable demanding the right not to ""gag"" at her own bad smell but not demand to be treated with common decency? She wouldn't have asked Alfre how she got her white man to treat her with some form of dignity? She wouldn't have stopped picking ""twice as much cotton as any man"" on the plantation every time the master or his wife abused her? She wouldn't have used her dolls to curse the master and his wife?The movie spent so many scenes showing horrors of slavery that its rushed ending robbed it of a great ending. Rather than merely writing it on the screen, many scenes could have been shortened &/or deleted to actually show the courtroom scenes depicting Solomon challenging the humanity, intelligence and fundamental decency of slavery.

Quite frankly, it initially left me disappointed on several levels in spite of the fact that it is a good movie and well worth the watch.  My first gut reaction is that it bore an uncanny resemblance to The Passion of Christ, a movie that I thoroughly despised for it's ridiculous tediousness.  The problem I have is this:  simply watching people getting bludgeoned, whipped, kicked and lynched over and over and over in the most brutal ways imaginable does not a good movie make.  Like the details that were the basis of  &#34;The Passion of Christ&#34;, most of us are fully aware of the brutality of slavery as well as the Biblical narrative of the scourging of Jesus.  Not only that, most of us have also watched this brutality over and over again throughout the years in many other movies; just not to the extreme degree as depicted in &#34;12 Years..&#34; and &#34;The Passion...&#34;  Having said all of that, &#34;12 Years a Slave&#34; was a far, far better movie than &#34;The Passion..&#34; At least it touched upon the main plot points of the memoirs of Solomon Northrup.  I also have to say that the acting in &#34;12 Years&#34;  was first rate as were the set designs, costuming, etc.&#34;12 Years&#34; is, in my opinion, a good movie but not a great movie.  I do think that it was highly over-rated.  It is not a movie I would want to watch again and again.  I have watched it twice through already, primarily because my first reaction was decidedly lukewarm at best, simply because of the previously described near-tediousness of it's brutality.  It was my second viewing of 12 Years, however, that I really learned to appreciate the masterful work of this film and therefore changed many of my first somewhat negative reactions.12 Years a Slave is indeed a very gut-wrenching, emotional film and is well worth the watch.  I would recommend it to anyone except those who are squeamish about blood, gore, violence and the vicious side of human nature.  This is probably THE definitive film on the nature of slavery in spite of what I've said before about it having been done before.  12 Years a Slave probably captures the very essence of slavery better than any other film ever made about the subject, so it gets my recommendation in spite of my minor disappointments.",4,12 Years A Slave: a good but slightly disappointing movie,1395446400,"03 22, 2014",2014,2368,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'when', 'eagerly', 'started', 'watch', '12', 'Years', 'Slave', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'initially', 'left', 'disappointed', 'several', 'levels', 'spite', 'fact', 'good', 'movie', 'well', 'watch', 'first', 'gut', 'reaction', 'bore', 'uncanny', 'resemblance', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'movie', 'thoroughly', 'despised', 'ridiculous', 'tediousness', 'problem', 'have', 'simply', 'watching', 'people', 'getting', 'bludgeoned', 'whipped', 'kicked', 'lynched', 'over', 'over', 'over', 'most', 'brutal', 'ways', 'imaginable', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'make', 'details', 'were', 'basis', '34', 'Passion', 'Christ', '34', 'most', 'are', 'fully', 'aware', 'brutality', 'slavery', 'as', 'well', 'Biblical', 'narrative', 'scourging', 'Jesus', 'Not', 'only', 'most', 'have', 'also', 'watched', 'brutality', 'over', 'again', 'years', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'just', 'not', 'extreme', 'degree', 'depicted', '34', '12', 'Years..', '34', '34', 'Passion', '34', 'Having', 'said', '34', '12', 'Slave', '34', 'was', 'far', 'far', 'better', 'movie', '34', 'Passion..', '34', 'least', 'touched', 'main', 'plot', 'points', 'memoirs', 'Solomon', 'Northrup', 'also', 'have', 'say', 'acting', '34', '12', 'Years', '34', 'was', 'first', 'rate', 'were', 'set', 'designs', 'costuming', 'etc.', '34', '12', 'Years', '34', 'opinion', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'do', 'think', 'was', 'highly', 'over-rated', 'not', 'movie', 'would', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'have', 'watched', 'twice', 'already', 'primarily', 'first', 'reaction', 'was', 'decidedly', 'lukewarm', 'best', 'simply', 'previously', 'described', 'near-tediousness', 'brutality', 'was', 'second', 'viewing', '12', 'Years', 'however', 'really', 'learned', 'appreciate', 'masterful', 'work', 'film', 'therefore', 'changed', 'many', 'first', 'somewhat', 'negative', 'reactions.12', 'Slave', 'indeed', 'very', 'gut-wrenching', 'emotional', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'watch', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'are', 'squeamish', 'blood', 'gore', 'violence', 'vicious', 'side', 'human', 'nature', 'probably', 'THE', 'definitive', 'film', 'nature', 'slavery', 'spite', 'what', ""'ve"", 'said', 'having', 'been', 'done', 'before', '12', 'Slave', 'probably', 'very', 'essence', 'slavery', 'better', 'other', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'subject', 'recommendation', 'spite', 'minor', 'disappointments']",12 Years a Slave

But what I think 12 Years A Slave brings to the table is how it shows in stark and unblinking terms the role of violence in supporting the institution of slavery.  Other films have of course shown violence in connection with slaves and slavery, but it is usually episodic - it happens and then it is done with.  None have made the connection so firmly as this one, showing that when one is a slave, violence and the threat of violence are ever present, always lurking beneath the surface, requiring only the slightest impulse or excuse to be unleashed on any slave whom the slave owner, overseer, dealer or in fact any member of the slave-owning class deems deserving of it. In this film, you can see why the institution endured as long as it did, why slaves so seldom rebelled and when they did were so quickly put down, and why, in the end, it had to be ended from outside the system with an even greater level of violence in the form of the Civil War.The film begins in 1841, in Saratoga Springs, New York, where Solomon Northup (Chiwitel Ejiofor in a sure-to-be-Oscar-nominated performance) is a free African-American living with his wife and two children. Solomon works as both a carpenter and as a fiddle player. One day when his wife and children were away on his wife's business, he is introduced to a pair of men (Scoot McNairy and Taran Killam) who work as travelling entertainers and is persuaded to join them on a tour to Washington that they assure him will be quite lucrative.  But once in DC, when their tour is apparently concluded and it's time to settle up, Solomon is tricked into drinking something that soon leaves him insensate and unable to resist.  When he awakes, he finds himself chained to a floor in a strange room, where two strangers enter and inform him that his name is Platt, that he is an escaped slave from Georgia and that he is to be taken to a slave market to be sold.  When he tries to assert the truth of his identity and status as a free man, he is immediately beaten into submission, and beaten again any time he tries to say anything other than the fake identity being forced upon him.Solomon, along with a few other kidnapped victims that include a mother and her two children, is shipped to New Orleans, where he is sold along with the mother, whose children are kept for separate sale, to Lousiana plantation owner William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch).  Ford turns out to be a relatively benevolent master, and in the hope of getting on his good side so that he might one day try to assert his real identity and status, Solomon assists him by suggesting and ultimately creating a waterway for transporting the plantation's logs swiftly and more efficiently downstream. In gratitude, Ford presents him with a violin, knowing that he can make use of it. However Solomon's efforts backfire on him in that he arouses the jealousy of a white carpenter in Ford's employ, John Tibeats (Paul Dano), who begins abusing him, first verbally and then physically, which pushes Solomon beyond the point of fear and results in his assaulting Tibeats and beating him with his own whip.  From there, things quickly go downhill and Ford, fearing for Solomon's safety, does what he thinks is the only way out and sells Solomon to another plantation owner named Epps (Michael Fassbender in a compelling chewing-the-scenery performance), warning Solomon that Epps is a harsh taskmaster but refusing to hear when Solomon desperately tries to tell him the truth of his identity, claiming that he has a debt to pay. From that point on Solomon's life goes straight to a hell that endures for eleven of the worst years one can imagine.A hard film to watch in places, but nonetheless a highly recommended one for anyone interested in what it meant both to be a slave and to be black during the slavery era.",5,Better than any other film before it at showing the role of violence in propping up the institution of slavery,1387065600,"12 15, 2013",2013,3980,"['have', 'been', 'number', 'films', 'mini-series', 'years', 'deal', 'lives', 'African-American', 'slaves', 'history', 'slavery', 'America', 'what', 'think', '12', 'Years', 'Slave', 'table', 'how', 'stark', 'unblinking', 'terms', 'role', 'violence', 'supporting', 'institution', 'slavery', 'Other', 'films', 'have', 'course', 'shown', 'violence', 'connection', 'slaves', 'slavery', 'usually', 'episodic', 'then', 'done', 'None', 'have', 'made', 'connection', 'so', 'firmly', 'one', 'showing', 'when', 'one', 'slave', 'violence', 'threat', 'violence', 'are', 'ever', 'present', 'always', 'lurking', 'surface', 'requiring', 'only', 'slightest', 'impulse', 'excuse', 'be', 'unleashed', 'slave', 'whom', 'slave', 'owner', 'overseer', 'dealer', 'fact', 'member', 'slave-owning', 'class', 'deserving', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'institution', 'endured', 'as', 'long', 'did', 'why', 'slaves', 'so', 'seldom', 'rebelled', 'when', 'did', 'were', 'so', 'quickly', 'put', 'down', 'why', 'end', 'had', 'be', 'ended', 'system', 'even', 'greater', 'level', 'violence', 'form', 'Civil', 'War.The', 'film', '1841', 'Saratoga', 'Springs', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'Solomon', 'Northup', 'Chiwitel', 'Ejiofor', 'sure-to-be-Oscar-nominated', 'performance', 'free', 'African-American', 'living', 'wife', 'two', 'children', 'Solomon', 'carpenter', 'fiddle', 'player', 'One', 'day', 'when', 'wife', 'children', 'were', 'away', 'wife', 'business', 'introduced', 'pair', 'men', 'Scoot', 'McNairy', 'Taran', 'Killam', 'who', 'work', 'travelling', 'entertainers', 'persuaded', 'join', 'tour', 'Washington', 'assure', 'will', 'be', 'quite', 'lucrative', 'once', 'DC', 'when', 'tour', 'apparently', 'concluded', 'time', 'settle', 'up', 'Solomon', 'tricked', 'drinking', 'something', 'soon', 'insensate', 'unable', 'resist', 'When', 'chained', 'floor', 'strange', 'room', 'where', 'two', 'strangers', 'enter', 'inform', 'name', 'Platt', 'escaped', 'slave', 'Georgia', 'be', 'taken', 'slave', 'market', 'be', 'sold', 'When', 'assert', 'truth', 'identity', 'status', 'free', 'man', 'immediately', 'beaten', 'submission', 'beaten', 'again', 'time', 'say', 'anything', 'other', 'fake', 'identity', 'being', 'forced', 'him.Solomon', 'few', 'other', 'kidnapped', 'victims', 'include', 'mother', 'two', 'children', 'shipped', 'New', 'Orleans', 'where', 'sold', 'mother', 'children', 'are', 'kept', 'separate', 'sale', 'Lousiana', 'plantation', 'owner', 'William', 'Ford', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'Ford', 'out', 'be', 'relatively', 'benevolent', 'master', 'hope', 'getting', 'good', 'side', 'so', 'might', 'one', 'day', 'try', 'assert', 'real', 'identity', 'status', 'Solomon', 'suggesting', 'ultimately', 'creating', 'waterway', 'transporting', 'plantation', 'logs', 'swiftly', 'more', 'efficiently', 'downstream', 'gratitude', 'Ford', 'violin', 'knowing', 'can', 'make', 'use', 'However', 'Solomon', 'efforts', 'backfire', 'jealousy', 'white', 'carpenter', 'Ford', 'employ', 'John', 'Tibeats', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'who', 'abusing', 'first', 'verbally', 'then', 'physically', 'Solomon', 'point', 'fear', 'results', 'assaulting', 'Tibeats', 'beating', 'own', 'whip', 'there', 'things', 'quickly', 'go', 'downhill', 'Ford', 'fearing', 'Solomon', 'safety', 'what', 'only', 'way', 'Solomon', 'plantation', 'owner', 'named', 'Epps', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'compelling', 'chewing-the-scenery', 'performance', 'warning', 'Solomon', 'Epps', 'harsh', 'taskmaster', 'refusing', 'hear', 'when', 'Solomon', 'desperately', 'tell', 'truth', 'identity', 'claiming', 'debt', 'pay', 'point', 'Solomon', 'life', 'straight', 'hell', 'eleven', 'worst', 'years', 'one', 'can', 'imagine.A', 'hard', 'film', 'watch', 'places', 'nonetheless', 'highly', 'recommended', 'one', 'anyone', 'interested', 'what', 'meant', 'be', 'slave', 'be', 'black', 'slavery', 'era']",12 Years a Slave

This film has wonderful performances, but it's basically only about Solomon's treatment as a slave and ends there. It doesn't go into the whole story. It doesn't go into how Soloman was born free (his father was a slave in the north, but his 'master' granted him his freedom in his will. His father did well as a free man and he became a land owner himself) His mother was 3/4ths white and 1/4 black.  It doesn't go into how he caught smallpox during the ship voyage or how he got a Sailor on that ship to send word to his father's old 'master's' family (Northup is the name they took from the family that owned his father before he was freed).  It was Northup's son Henry who received the letter from the sailor and told his wife Ann what had happened. (So his wife knew what had happened to him during all those years)  Because Henry Northup was a lawyer he knew how to use the law to get him back home, but because he didn't know where Solomon was going to end up he couldn't do anything.  In order to take action he had to know where he was, but when he did eventually find out where he was, Henry Northup was instrumental in rescuing Solomon.  And then of coarse there were the legal trials against his kidnappers... which were a hole other drama that caused enough stir for the New York Times to publish on it.  First the trial against his first 'owner' in washington where blacks were not allowed to testify in trial so the owner got off scott free.  Then the trial against his kidnappers, whom no one could find because they used false names... but after Solomon published his book a Judge in New York recalled seeing two white men whom he knew well accompanied by a black man traveling to Washington and he recalled that when they returned they were without the black man.  They also asked him to please call them by different names while in the company of the black man.  This judge wondered if it was possible that these were the two involved in the kidnapping.  Sure enough they were!  What are the chances of that?  The kidnappers were arrested, but after lengthy trial and appeals they never paid for their crime even though both Solomon and the county judge testified against them.  NONE of this is in the movie!  I liked the movie, but they left some of the most interesting things out.

I would have liked it more had it not been so heavy-handed in so many ways. Based on a true story, it needed to have been told no matter how painful the message. Movie goers need a counterpoint to sanitized versions of slavery presented in films like Gone With the Wind. Slavery was evil and a blot on our nation's history. So many people suffered horrible indignities along with physical and psychological brutality in a supposed &#34;land of the free&#34; and most of that was wrought by Caucasians. It is a shame upon my race and rightly so. With that said, I feel the film lost some validity in telling it's powerful and painful story by painting almost every white person with negative strokes. You had to get to the end of the film before you encountered a white person with integrity, decency, and compassion. Even ones that seemed humane could not be trusted or believed. After a while it was like listening to a guard dog that barks at anything and everything. When you do need to heed the message you have become so numbed by the steady stream that you tune it out.
