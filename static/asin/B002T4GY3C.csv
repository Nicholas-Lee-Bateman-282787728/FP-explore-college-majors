1287720,A3KJBDFCVSLZEO,B002T4GY3C,"Allen ""A lover of books! And Artist by trade.""","[0, 0]","WHAT KIND OF MOVIE IS IT???Well it is a horror movie set in Argentina.  And yes it is Sub-titled... BUT do not let that take away from this movie!!!  If you skip it because of that YOU WILL MISS OUT!!!THE MOVIE STARTS:Siblings  Malena and Pablo, brother and sister, meet in a hospital to sign the order to pull the plug on their father.  He is a bastard and  Malena wants to just sign the papers, but Pablo convinces her to wait, until they at least see their childhood home.THEN they find the diary.  The diary contains photos and details of horrible murders and kidnappings that took place twenty years before.They stop for the night and PAST and PRESENT become like one.  They witness the horrible torture and murder of a family, just like it described in the diary!They get out of there and HE tries to save the people, but they do not know if the people are even real or ghosts, or what!  They ""follow the diary"" by seeing where and what the next killing will be.  It is through this that they realize where and what the horror of ""The Disappeared"" is.Even though this is the basis for what happened twenty years ago... the movie does not focus on this and just uses it as part of the story.The movie has many scary scenes and places with very creepy ghosts and psychos!  There are a few places where the characters make choices that seem VERY far fetched... but they are small parts and can easily be ignored.  Like... WHAT? Don't go in there!  ...or why not turn around and run now???  DON'T let that stop you from having a wonderful time watching a great horror movie with a likable cast and a mystery stuck in for good measure!Have fun!!!P.S.  A FACTUAL NOTE:So What was this murder business all based on???The Argentina Military Dictatorship and regime where responsible for the disappearances and deaths of upwards of 30,000 people in the Anti-communism genocide in that country from 1976 - around 1983.  A horrible atrocity that the movie bases the premise and not the story.

It's hard to summarize this movie without giving away key parts of the plot - your anxiety and fear for the sister and brother accelerate immensely as the movie progresses and they begin seeing very clear and realistic ghosts from a past that increasingly seems connected to them.This movie is well done, but it takes a very long time to tell the story and there are some pretty violent, repetitive scenes of the murder of a family that connects to their own past. I think the end did not tie up very strongly, though I found the the last moments to be very moving - showing in a very graphic way the sacrifices that have been made for Spain by the victims of its past. Although not as strong as Il Orfanato or The Devil's Backbone, this is another film that suggests a brilliantly developing film genre in Spain.",3,Very good but had some weak points,1336348800,"05 7, 2012",2012,983,"['Shortly', 'movie', 'feel', 'very', 'fond', 'extremely', 'likeable', 'protagonist', 'Pablo', 'hard-boiled', 'sister', 'Malena', 'bit', 'longer', 'care', 'hard', 'summarize', 'movie', 'giving', 'away', 'key', 'parts', 'plot', 'anxiety', 'fear', 'sister', 'brother', 'accelerate', 'immensely', 'movie', 'begin', 'seeing', 'very', 'clear', 'realistic', 'ghosts', 'past', 'increasingly', 'connected', 'them.This', 'movie', 'well', 'done', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'tell', 'story', 'are', 'pretty', 'violent', 'repetitive', 'scenes', 'murder', 'family', 'own', 'past', 'think', 'end', 'did', 'not', 'tie', 'up', 'very', 'strongly', 'found', 'last', 'moments', 'be', 'very', 'moving', 'showing', 'very', 'graphic', 'way', 'sacrifices', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'Spain', 'victims', 'past', 'not', 'as', 'strong', 'Il', 'Orfanato', 'Devil', 'Backbone', 'film', 'brilliantly', 'developing', 'film', 'genre', 'Spain']",The Appeared

It was well directed with a pervasive sense of dread, nail-biting suspense, and delivers several jolting shocks of terror. The only problem I had with it were a few instances where characters suddenly do stupid things that go against all rational judgement under the circumstances. Aside from a few of these flaws (sure to be exploited by the haters) the movie overall is very tight and some scenes of suspense are VERY INTENSE. There are some stunning revelations as well, which makes it more interesting than your average horror movie. The political aspect of the story isn't overpowering and is only briefly discussed, providing a suitable backdrop for the horror. There are really no boring scenes and there is an abundance of stark terror that will surely satisfy those looking for real scares.
