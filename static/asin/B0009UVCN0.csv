Instead, it has Victor Garber (Alias - The Complete Collection (Seasons 1-5 + Rambaldi artifact box)) as Mr. Showmanship, and he's excellent. Maureen Stapleton is powerful as Frances, Liberace's domineering mother. We see Liberace's father abandon him at a young age- and after the traumatic loss of his virginity to a woman- Frances comforts him. It's a melodramatic version of the ""distant father, dominating mother"" scenarios fromA Parent's Guide to Preventing Homosexuality. Garber puts a face on Liberace's struggle. Liberace is, for the most part, sympathetic. While Garber is excellent as an actor, the screenplay isn't up to par.""Liberace"" whirls through the events of his life- from his kidney problems, to his affair with Scott Thorson, to his death from AIDS.  His meeting with Elvis Presley is brief. Liberace's relationship with Thorson (Behind the Candelabra) gets short shrift. We see Thorson drop in, do drugs, drop out. We don't even see him get plastic surgery to look like Liberace's younger clone.Despite the strong performances, ""Behind the Music"" lacks depth.

913342,A1XKI53W1E891T,B0009UVCN0,Amy,"[17, 18]","Actor Victor Garber portrays the legendary child prodigy Liberace, who became one of the world's greatest entertainers, while embracing a lifestyle of flamboyant excess. Liberace was a gifted classical pianist, fueled by poverty, at the age of 17 Liberace was already playing with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, but he wanted more. Through a combination of showmanship, determination and amazing talent he acheived his dream as the world's highest paid performer. Liberace had an amazing ability of combining together the popular tunes of the day with classical music always improvising on the spot live in front of a huge audience giving requests of songs for him to play. Liberace was always trying to get people to love and respect classical music as much as he did. But behind the diamonds and wealth Liberace became a prisoner of his elaborate double life. His desperate attempts to keep his gay private life and that he was dying of AIDS secret backfired in a series of scandals and front page news lawsuits. This was a very moving, sensitive movie and I've enjoyed watching it many times. Liberace was truly the greatest entertainer of all time. He had it all, humor, charisma and out of this world talent. There will never be anyone else like that. He was one of a kind. If you've watched any of Liberace's shows you know he always ended every show with playing and singing the song, ""I'll be Seeing You"". I found it very fitting that's how the movie ends with Liberace playing the piano and singing the lyrics:I'll be seeing youIn all the old, familiar placesThat this heart of mine embracesAll day through.I'll be seeing youAnd when the night is newI'll be looking at the moonBut I'll be seeing you.",5,Best movie about Liberace's life,1186963200,"08 13, 2007",2007,1710,"['Actor', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'legendary', 'child', 'prodigy', 'Liberace', 'who', 'became', 'one', 'world', 'greatest', 'entertainers', 'embracing', 'lifestyle', 'flamboyant', 'excess', 'Liberace', 'was', 'gifted', 'classical', 'pianist', 'fueled', 'poverty', 'age', '17', 'Liberace', 'was', 'already', 'playing', 'Chicago', 'Symphony', 'Orchestra', 'wanted', 'more', 'combination', 'showmanship', 'determination', 'amazing', 'talent', 'acheived', 'dream', 'world', 'highest', 'paid', 'performer', 'Liberace', 'had', 'amazing', 'ability', 'combining', 'together', 'popular', 'tunes', 'day', 'classical', 'music', 'always', 'improvising', 'spot', 'live', 'front', 'huge', 'audience', 'giving', 'requests', 'songs', 'play', 'Liberace', 'was', 'always', 'trying', 'get', 'people', 'love', 'respect', 'classical', 'music', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'diamonds', 'wealth', 'Liberace', 'became', 'prisoner', 'elaborate', 'double', 'life', 'desperate', 'attempts', 'keep', 'gay', 'private', 'life', 'was', 'dying', 'AIDS', 'secret', 'backfired', 'series', 'scandals', 'front', 'page', 'news', 'lawsuits', 'was', 'very', 'moving', 'sensitive', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'many', 'times', 'Liberace', 'was', 'truly', 'greatest', 'entertainer', 'time', 'had', 'all', 'humor', 'charisma', 'world', 'talent', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'anyone', 'else', 'was', 'one', 'kind', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Liberace', 'shows', 'know', 'always', 'ended', 'show', 'playing', 'singing', 'song', ""'ll"", 'be', 'Seeing', 'found', 'very', 'fitting', 'how', 'movie', 'Liberace', 'playing', 'piano', 'singing', 'lyrics', ""'ll"", 'be', 'seeing', 'old', 'familiar', 'heart', 'mine', 'embracesAll', 'day', 'through.I', ""'ll"", 'be', 'seeing', 'when', 'night', 'newI', ""'ll"", 'be', 'looking', 'moonBut', ""'ll"", 'be', 'seeing']",Liberace Behind The Music

I enjoyed the HBO movie with Michael Douglass and Matt Damon. I also grew up watching Liberace on TV. I didn't worry about who he really was. Gays closeted themselves, since to have come out would have ruined their careers, much like mental illness has a stigma. Victor Garber was always a favorite actor of mine and I would like to see how his performance differs from the new version. In some ways the actual Liberace always seemed somewhat cartoonish. That is how he protected himself. I will probably have more to say after viewing the DVD. I also want to see if there is a mention of Scott Thorson, who wrote the book the Douglass/Damon version was based upon.

913352,A2PAKB0NYQLCSG,B0009UVCN0,Scott MacGillivray,"[30, 30]","This 1988 TV-movie dramatizes the life of Liberace, who rose from a ""shabby"" background to become a world-class pianist and a human monument to glamour. In other hands this could have been a shrill, sensationalized biography, dwelling on smirking innuendos  and tawdry episodes, with Liberace presented as a flamboyant, shallow caricature. Thankfully both the script and the performances are sympathetic, and viewers can sense just how sensitive and troubled Liberace was.Victor Garber turns in a stellar performance as Liberace. The actor obviously studied Liberace's speech patterns. body language, and pianistics, and the results are dazzling: he not only looks and sounds like Liberace, he even sings like him. The film commendably traces Liberace's rise to fame and re-creates milestones in his career (including a careful facsimile of his 1950s TV show).Unfortunately the action is sometimes choppy, with sudden stops and abrupt transitions. Several of the plot elements and characters are established without introduction or identification, and just as suddenly abandoned. What should be a finished portrait comes across as a hasty sketch. It's hard to tell if this is the screenwriter failing to develop certain situations, or the film editor being forced to cram a 50-year span into an hour and a half. Either way, the momentum of the story is frequently blunted, but Garber's riveting turn helps cover the rough spots.Maureen Stapleton is excellent as Liberace's possessive mother, as is Saul Rubinek as his longtime manager Seymour Heller (who is credited as a technical advisor). Macha Grenon's presence is welcome as one of the young Liberace's few friends, but she is hastily written out (or edited out) as the film forges ahead.Picture and sound quality are very good overall (there are two tiny digital glitches in the video transfer, causing momentary silences). The DVD also includes a trailer (actually an extended TV promo, using many representative clips).Watch this one for Victor Garber. He's most of the show.",4,Add 1 star for magnificent Garber performance; subtract 1 star for choppy continuity,1208131200,"04 14, 2008",2008,2033,"['1988', 'TV-movie', 'life', 'Liberace', 'who', 'rose', 'shabby', 'background', 'become', 'world-class', 'pianist', 'human', 'monument', 'glamour', 'other', 'hands', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shrill', 'sensationalized', 'biography', 'dwelling', 'smirking', 'innuendos', 'tawdry', 'episodes', 'Liberace', 'presented', 'flamboyant', 'shallow', 'caricature', 'Thankfully', 'script', 'performances', 'are', 'sympathetic', 'viewers', 'can', 'sense', 'just', 'how', 'sensitive', 'troubled', 'Liberace', 'was.Victor', 'Garber', 'stellar', 'performance', 'Liberace', 'actor', 'obviously', 'studied', 'Liberace', 'speech', 'patterns', 'body', 'language', 'pianistics', 'results', 'are', 'dazzling', 'not', 'only', 'like', 'Liberace', 'even', 'sings', 'film', 'commendably', 'Liberace', 'rise', 'fame', 're-creates', 'milestones', 'career', 'including', 'careful', 'facsimile', '1950s', 'TV', 'show', '.Unfortunately', 'action', 'sometimes', 'choppy', 'sudden', 'stops', 'abrupt', 'transitions', 'Several', 'plot', 'elements', 'characters', 'are', 'established', 'introduction', 'identification', 'just', 'suddenly', 'abandoned', 'What', 'should', 'be', 'finished', 'portrait', 'across', 'hasty', 'sketch', 'hard', 'tell', 'screenwriter', 'failing', 'develop', 'certain', 'situations', 'film', 'editor', 'being', 'forced', 'cram', '50-year', 'span', 'hour', 'half', 'way', 'momentum', 'story', 'frequently', 'blunted', 'Garber', 'riveting', 'turn', 'cover', 'rough', 'spots.Maureen', 'Stapleton', 'excellent', 'Liberace', 'possessive', 'mother', 'Saul', 'Rubinek', 'longtime', 'manager', 'Seymour', 'Heller', 'who', 'credited', 'technical', 'advisor', 'Macha', 'Grenon', 'presence', 'welcome', 'one', 'young', 'Liberace', 'few', 'friends', 'hastily', 'written', 'out', 'edited', 'out', 'film', 'ahead.Picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'overall', 'are', 'two', 'tiny', 'digital', 'glitches', 'video', 'transfer', 'causing', 'momentary', 'silences', 'DVD', 'also', 'trailer', 'actually', 'extended', 'TV', 'promo', 'using', 'many', 'representative', 'clips', '.Watch', 'one', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'most', 'show']",Liberace Behind The Music

I had seen it and remembered the fictional ""Miss Be Haven devirgin-izing scene"" but transposed both as the same film. The acting here is decent and Candelabra HBO fans like myself will have to admit that seeing an actual teenage actor in the role of Scott Thosron, albeit with a very clunky script, is a bit of a game changer.  As much as I loved Matt Damon's performance (and he does look much younger than his years) and find it superior, it did make me wonder what a 18 to 22 years old actor would have done with the part and how much more dramatic they would have looked as a couple. The production had very fake backdrops at one point and the studio lighting was mediocre. I wish that Liberace's final days had been dealt with more thoroughly and with more compassion. The worst was the ending where they mention AIDS and leave it like that with a cheap fast credit roll over a freeze frame. But Victor Garber was GREAT and Lee fans will still want to watch this.
