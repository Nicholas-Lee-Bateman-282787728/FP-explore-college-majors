854842,A1DRKVXO300RUE,B0003JAOLS,Amazon Customer,"[1, 3]","Ski School (part 1) is perhaps my guiltiest of pleasures.  I know its an absurd movie with no point, sophomoric humor, etc., but I absolutely love it, and have watched it 1x/month for at least 8 years now.  I can readily assume the role of film snob (e.g., I adore David Lynch works, There Will Be Blood, etc.), and so it pains me all the more to publicly announce my support for Ski School.  I cannot say the same for Ski School 2.  True to typical form, the sequel proves a letdown. All that made Ski School 1 great are noticeably absent from this one - a multi-layered plot that actually revolves around skiing, an at least technically competent director/dop, a right sized and appropriately cast cast, and amusing humor that doesn't fall (constantly) into the puerile abyss. So, seriatim, Ski School 2 just didn't work. The plot revolved purely around a love interest; the skiing was relegated to a secondary irrelevance with no plot significance (no tournament?  wtf).  Although I'm not motivated enough to check, I'm guessing that an entirely different crew shot and assembled this film.  The camera work is generally goofy - lots of weird in-your-face ultra closeups of guys' faces that we really shouldn't see that closely...as opposed to the generally not-distractingly-bad composed shots of Ski School 1. Four primary characters - Dave, who reprised his Ski School 1 role, but with far less wit and charm, then 3 other characters who were completely irrelevant and had no impact on the plot.  In Ski School 1, we at least had Fitz who was the perfect male character companion to Dave's antics.  Further, the Ski School 2 actors were just terrible.  Worst of all, though, its the humor.  I suppose its consistent with sequel commonalities. In horror sequels, the body count and blood letting tend to increase; so too here, the humor certainly increases, but it does so gratingly with an emphasis on sophomoric and not-even-funny-to-an-14 y/o-humor approach. It wasn't potty humor, but sadly uncreative abortive attempts at making the audience laugh.  Think of part 1 - the scene of setting the two Section 1 guys up on film, and then airing their dys-exploits for the whole bar to enjoy was pretty funny. But that humor lasted an entire scene; it took time to build the punch line, time to execute the punch line, then to make it actually punch; good stuff.  Part 2, the jokes were mostly one liners, and little emphasis on well developed either story or physical comedy.  It is certainly with a saddened heart that I must encourage the avoidance of this film; its not even worth a rental, not even if you're feeling a mid-life-crisis-impelled need to potent beverage-ly reconnect with your lost prepubescent infantile humor wooby.  Just rewatch part 1, and hang your head proud that while you've grown up, you've successfully resisted the full Inquisition-like weight of societally expected maturation.",2,Such a let down,1251676800,"08 31, 2009",2009,2912,"['Ski', 'School', 'part', '1', 'perhaps', 'guiltiest', 'pleasures', 'know', 'absurd', 'movie', 'point', 'sophomoric', 'humor', 'etc.', 'absolutely', 'love', 'have', 'watched', '1x/month', 'least', '8', 'years', 'now', 'can', 'readily', 'assume', 'role', 'film', 'snob', 'e.g.', 'adore', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'etc', 'so', 'more', 'publicly', 'announce', 'support', 'Ski', 'School', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'same', 'Ski', 'School', '2', 'True', 'typical', 'form', 'sequel', 'letdown', 'made', 'Ski', 'School', '1', 'great', 'are', 'noticeably', 'absent', 'one', 'multi-layered', 'plot', 'actually', 'skiing', 'least', 'technically', 'competent', 'director/dop', 'right', 'sized', 'appropriately', 'cast', 'cast', 'amusing', 'humor', ""n't"", 'fall', 'constantly', 'puerile', 'abyss', 'So', 'seriatim', 'Ski', 'School', '2', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'plot', 'revolved', 'purely', 'love', 'interest', 'skiing', 'was', 'relegated', 'secondary', 'irrelevance', 'plot', 'significance', 'tournament', 'wtf', ""'m"", 'not', 'motivated', 'enough', 'check', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'entirely', 'different', 'crew', 'shot', 'assembled', 'film', 'camera', 'work', 'generally', 'goofy', 'lots', 'weird', 'in-your-face', 'ultra', 'closeups', 'guys', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'see', 'closely', 'opposed', 'generally', 'not-distractingly-bad', 'composed', 'shots', 'Ski', 'School', '1', 'Four', 'primary', 'characters', 'Dave', 'who', 'reprised', 'Ski', 'School', '1', 'role', 'far', 'less', 'wit', 'charm', 'then', '3', 'other', 'characters', 'who', 'were', 'completely', 'irrelevant', 'had', 'impact', 'plot', 'Ski', 'School', '1', 'least', 'had', 'Fitz', 'who', 'was', 'perfect', 'male', 'character', 'companion', 'Dave', 'antics', 'Further', 'Ski', 'School', '2', 'actors', 'were', 'just', 'terrible', 'Worst', 'though', 'humor', 'suppose', 'consistent', 'sequel', 'commonalities', 'horror', 'sequels', 'body', 'count', 'blood', 'letting', 'tend', 'increase', 'so', 'too', 'here', 'humor', 'certainly', 'so', 'gratingly', 'emphasis', 'sophomoric', 'not-even-funny-to-an-14', 'y/o-humor', 'approach', 'was', ""n't"", 'potty', 'humor', 'sadly', 'uncreative', 'abortive', 'attempts', 'making', 'audience', 'laugh', 'Think', 'part', '1', 'scene', 'setting', 'two', 'Section', '1', 'guys', 'up', 'film', 'then', 'airing', 'dys-exploits', 'whole', 'bar', 'enjoy', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'humor', 'lasted', 'entire', 'scene', 'took', 'time', 'build', 'punch', 'line', 'time', 'execute', 'punch', 'line', 'then', 'make', 'actually', 'good', 'stuff', 'Part', '2', 'jokes', 'were', 'mostly', 'one', 'liners', 'little', 'emphasis', 'well', 'developed', 'story', 'physical', 'comedy', 'certainly', 'saddened', 'heart', 'must', 'encourage', 'avoidance', 'film', 'not', 'even', 'rental', 'not', 'even', ""'re"", 'feeling', 'mid-life-crisis-impelled', 'need', 'potent', 'beverage-ly', 'reconnect', 'lost', 'prepubescent', 'infantile', 'humor', 'wooby', 'Just', 'rewatch', 'part', '1', 'hang', 'head', 'proud', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'up', ""'ve"", 'successfully', 'resisted', 'full', 'Inquisition-like', 'weight', 'societally', 'expected', 'maturation']",N/A
