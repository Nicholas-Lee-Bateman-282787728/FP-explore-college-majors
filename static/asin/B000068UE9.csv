706073,A32GCOTGFJ9XC3,B000068UE9,"Alex Honda ""onyx575""","[3, 3]","I wasn't familiar with Joan Hickson's portrayal of Agatha Christie's ""Jane Marple,"" the only one I knew was Helen Hayes, so it was a real treat to see these three movies.I enjoy the theme music and the quaint illustrations at the beginning of each episode, two of the movies ""The Body In The Library"" and ""Murder Is Announced"" is split up into three episodes each, while the remaining one ""A Pocketful Of Rye"" is split into two episodes, which I assume is how they originally aired. Anyway, the openings are really nice, as the camera pans in and shows some shifty characters lurking in the shadows, reminding us that things are not always what they seem.The quality on each movie is OK; although the back of the DVD box says the movies have been remastered, the picture isn't as sharp as something current but this is probably due to the source material having degraded. Still, the visual quality won't interfere with viewing pleasure.I haven't read any of Christie's books, so I don't know how faithful the movies are, but watchingAgatha Christie's Poirot: Series 1 [Blu-ray], and comparing the two, I find differences in how both play out. In these Miss Marple Mysteries, Miss Marple almost seems like a secondary character who comes and goes, while the series of ""Poirot"" has the Belgium detective front and center.Watching Joan Hickson's portrayal as ""Miss Marple"" and she seems at times like a babbling spinster suffering from dementia, but it's only because she's lost in thought, trying to remember where or when she saw or heard something, and you can almost see the gears spinning in her mind. The character speaks with little nuggets of info and it seems that she might have figured out who done it, but she won't reveal it until she's got all the puzzle pieces and that they fit together, which is when she reveals all to us viewers. Great fun.There are cast text bios in the special features and a really nice featurette called ""Crime Does Pay.""* CRIME DOES PAY * -- 29:11-minutes -- 1990 FeaturetteThe special was created in 1990 and is narrated and hosted by Keith Blackler and takes the viewer to Torquay, known as the English Riviera and Christie's birth place, which is celebrating the her centenary birthday. There are scenes of Mystery Tours, where people can pay to become part of a mystery and try and solve it, you get to go on board the Orient Express, and a meeting between Joan Hickson ""Miss Jane Marple"" and David Suchet ""Hercule Poirot"", both in character. There's also interviews with both Hickson and Suchet, and Christie's grandson Mathew Prichard.There are three DVDs in all with a running time of 421-minutes, according to the box. If you like mysteries and British TV, I think you'll enjoy this set. There are no closed captions, unless I hit the wrong button on my remote control, but the box says that there should be captions.",4,*Enjoyable* With 1- Great ***Special***,1351123200,"10 25, 2012",2012,2863,"['was', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'Joan', 'Hickson', 'portrayal', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'Jane', 'Marple', 'only', 'one', 'knew', 'was', 'Helen', 'Hayes', 'was', 'real', 'treat', 'see', 'three', 'movies.I', 'enjoy', 'theme', 'music', 'quaint', 'illustrations', 'beginning', 'episode', 'two', 'movies', 'Body', 'Library', 'Murder', 'Is', 'Announced', 'split', 'up', 'three', 'episodes', 'remaining', 'one', 'Pocketful', 'Rye', 'split', 'two', 'episodes', 'assume', 'how', 'originally', 'aired', 'Anyway', 'openings', 'are', 'really', 'nice', 'camera', 'shifty', 'characters', 'lurking', 'shadows', 'reminding', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'what', 'seem.The', 'quality', 'movie', 'OK', 'back', 'DVD', 'box', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'remastered', 'picture', ""n't"", 'as', 'sharp', 'something', 'current', 'probably', 'due', 'source', 'material', 'having', 'degraded', 'Still', 'visual', 'quality', 'wo', ""n't"", 'interfere', 'viewing', 'pleasure.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Christie', 'books', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'faithful', 'movies', 'are', 'watchingAgatha', 'Christie', 'Poirot', '1', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'comparing', 'two', 'find', 'differences', 'how', 'play', 'out', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'Mysteries', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'almost', 'secondary', 'character', 'who', 'series', 'Poirot', 'Belgium', 'detective', 'front', 'center.Watching', 'Joan', 'Hickson', 'portrayal', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'times', 'babbling', 'spinster', 'suffering', 'dementia', 'only', 'lost', 'thought', 'trying', 'remember', 'where', 'when', 'saw', 'heard', 'something', 'can', 'almost', 'see', 'gears', 'spinning', 'mind', 'character', 'little', 'nuggets', 'info', 'might', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'who', 'done', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'got', 'puzzle', 'pieces', 'fit', 'together', 'when', 'viewers', 'Great', 'are', 'cast', 'text', 'bios', 'special', 'features', 'really', 'nice', 'featurette', 'called', 'Crime', 'Does', 'Pay', '*', 'CRIME', 'DOES', 'PAY', '*', '29:11-minutes', '1990', 'FeaturetteThe', 'special', 'was', 'created', '1990', 'narrated', 'hosted', 'Keith', 'Blackler', 'viewer', 'Torquay', 'known', 'English', 'Riviera', 'Christie', 'birth', 'place', 'celebrating', 'centenary', 'birthday', 'are', 'scenes', 'Mystery', 'Tours', 'where', 'people', 'can', 'pay', 'become', 'part', 'mystery', 'try', 'solve', 'get', 'go', 'board', 'Orient', 'Express', 'meeting', 'Joan', 'Hickson', 'Miss', 'Jane', 'Marple', 'David', 'Suchet', 'Hercule', 'Poirot', 'character', 'also', 'interviews', 'Hickson', 'Suchet', 'Christie', 'grandson', 'Mathew', 'Prichard.There', 'are', 'three', 'DVDs', 'running', 'time', '421-minutes', 'according', 'box', 'like', 'mysteries', 'British', 'TV', 'think', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'set', 'are', 'closed', 'captions', 'hit', 'wrong', 'button', 'remote', 'control', 'box', 'should', 'be', 'captions']",Miss Marple - 3 Feature Length Mysteries (The Body in the Library / A Murder Is Announced / A Pocketful of Rye)

706076,A20EEWWSFMZ1PN,B000068UE9,"bernie ""xyzzy""","[0, 0]","""Body in the Library""Mrs. Dolly Bantry (Gwen Watford) tries to inform her husband of the reported body and is accused of imagining the report due to reading trashy books in bead at night.  As usual Jane is always in the right place to view the potential suspects. Clues are everywhere yet who would mix body's and books?Speaking about night I would not start this film to late, as it seems to go on forever at 151 minutes. As it was a made for TV (1984), I suspect that this movie is a composite of a series. And there are places where it takes leaps to different situations with out any transition. You can guess the plot in general but the details are surprising. It is wrapped up so quickly that you will need to run the ending a few times to put it all in perspective""A Murder is Announced""A man dies in Chipping Kleghorn under mysterious circumstances and suddenly Aunt Jane is coming to stay. As with most Agatha Christie's movies, everybody and nobody could have done it. Miss Jane Marple is the catalyst that helps Inspector Craddock (John Castle) and others to view the situation differently and extrapolate the ""who"" that done it.It is interesting that the inspector in some movies, is related to Jane and in other movies not. Inspector Craddock here is interesting as he is polite and tolerant of the people he is interrogating.It is fun to try and match the real names of the actors with the part that they are playing. Would you suspect that Hannah is (Elaine Ives-Cameron)? Or that Miss Hinchcliffe is (Paola Dionisotti)?Anyway keep your eyes open, as there is not a wasted movement or word in this movie.""A Pocket Full of Rye""Rex Fortescue is out of character as he arrives at is office. You immediately know something is wrong because this is England and Rex has ordered his tea much too early. Yep mean old nasty Rex is found dead. Thorough detectives have determined that there was some mysterious grain in his pocket. If you remember the nursery rime you can follow the story. So how does Jane become involved? She trained the maid and is afraid for her safety. Naturally at several places in the mystery Miss Marple (Joan Hickson) points out the obvious to Det. Sergeant Hay (Jon Glover) who realizes and corrects the error of not listening to her.There is only one repugnant scene where you have to watch Rex eat.

The inspector had thought he was dealing with a rather straight forward case of murder in the village of Chipping Cleghorn.""A Mr., Mrs. or Miss X, I should say,"" replies Miss Marple. She is an old woman who may knit and garden, but she has very sharp eyes. ""You know, Inspector,"" she continues, ""some of the best murderers are women, especially in an English village. Turn over a stone and you'll have no idea what will crawl out."" Miss Marple takes another sip of tea.Nor should any murderer underestimate this slightly frail, inquisitive and observant woman, long a resident of the English village of St. Mary Mead, who is given to wearing tweeds and sensible shoes. Miss Marple has a mind as logical as a trap. As she says, ""It's very dangerous to believe people. I haven't for years."" When murder has been done, those aged eyes see things, especially in the behavior and habits of those around her, which lead to retribution. As played by Joan Hickson, Miss Marple is invariably courteous and very much of the old school when it comes to manners. She may occasionally offer advice, but is remarkably realistic. ""Good advice is almost certain to be ignored,"" she says, ""but that's no reason for not giving it."" She may take part in a bit of gossip, but almost always she is giving a bit of information in order to get even more back. Hickson's Miss Marple is not without empathy or friends, but she essentially is a person quite satisfied to do her gardening. She does not twinkle.In A Murder Is Announced (1985), one of three feature-length made-for-TV movies in this collection, Miss Marple finds herself dealing with an almost intractably clever series of murders set in the picture-perfect village of Chipping Cleghorn, all driven by a family relationship that goes back a generation. The mystery is complex, the motives selfish, the manners of the characters are all genteel, and the bodies pile up. The murderer is singularly ruthless.With The Body in the Library (1984), Miss Marple finds herself with a seemingly anonymous body found in the library of Gossington Hall, stately home of the stately Colonel and Mrs. Bantry.And with A Pocketful of Rye (1985), Miss Marple finds that with the Fortescue family, she will need all her powers of observation to sort through the many motives of envy, greed, resentment and longing.Joan Hickson is a marvel as Jane Marple. Many have played the character, usually with distinction, but Hickson has set the bar extremely high. As good as the others have been and are, she still is the best. Lending great support in these three movies are a wide range of superior British actors. In addition to John Castle, some others who show up in the three stories include such favorites as Renee Asherson, Joan Sims, Moray Watson, Tom Wilkinson, Ursula Howells, Peter Davison, Joyce Carey and so many more.Each mystery runs about 2 hours and 40 minutes. The DVD transfers could have been better; they have the quality of a mid-range VHS tape, not good but not too bad. Regardless of the quality, if you enjoy mysteries with complex plots, fine acting, good manners and featuring a relentless solver of murders, these Miss Marple movies are the real thing.",5,Never underestimate Miss Marple.

706088,A1C70R9KCILEU,B000068UE9,Elle,"[0, 0]","**No Spoilers**The Body in the Library:It's early Friday morning and Dolly Bantry is just barely awake.  She hears footsteps on the stairs and gently attempts to stir her sleeping husband by whispering, ""Tea. Arthur."" Their young maid, Mary, enters but she isn't bringing tea, she cries, ""Oh! Ma'am, ma'am, there's a body in the library!""  Sobbing, she whirls around and leaves.  Dolly sits for a moment in stunned silence before prodding Arthur awake.  Arthur not believing it to be true; Dolly must be imagining things due to her bedtime-murder-mystery-reading, reluctantly and grumpily marches himself downstairs to get to the bottom of such nonsense!  Well, turns out it's true.  There's a blonde, platinum blonde, dead in their library!Dolly races to the village to fetch Miss Marple so that she can get a look at the body before Constable Palk arrives.  Dolly is sure that her friend Jane will figure out this dreadful situation.  Unfortunately, Arthur is quickly presumed to be guilty of something, if not murder then some kind of suspicious association with the dead young woman when he can't explain her body's presence, he doesn't have an alibi, and everyone knows that ""where there's smoke...""  How can there be a body in the colonel's library and he not know a thing about it?  Things turn even worse for Arthur, if that's possible, when in combination of not having an alibi, he is linked to the victim!The body is identified as 18-year old, Ruby Keene, a dance hostess at the seaside resort, The Majestic Hotel, where Arthur had recently dined. Inspector Slack, who is assigned to the case, immediately jumps to the conclusion that Colonel Bantry is indeed guilty.  Arthur had means and opportunity and while a motive is not known, Slack feels sure it will come to light.No matter what, Dolly has unwavering faith in her husband and most especially in Miss Marple.  She confidently proclaims, ""I'm sure Jane's worked it out already!""  Jane replies, ""Well...it's like Tommy Bond and the new school mistress, Mrs. Martin.  She went to wind up the clock and a frog jumped out."" Her answer is met with blank stares and silence...even from Dolly.  Fortunately for Bantry, Chief Constable Colonel Melchett is a friend and neighbor of his and wields his influence to reel in Slack, thereby keeping him out of the nick. Melchett also happens to be an admirer of Jane's keen detection skills and looks to her for her insight and observations.To do their sleuthing, Dolly whisks Jane to The Majestic to solve this terrible murder of a young woman and in the process ""save"" Colonel Bantry. While at the Majestic, Jane reads in the paper that a young girl has gone missing and she is certain that her disappearance is connected in some way to Ruby's murder. Inspector Slack dismisses Jane's connection theory until, sadly, the young girl's body is found.The Body in the Library is my favorite Miss Marple movie, in this set.  Joan Hickson is and remains my favorite Miss Marple.  I love, love, love her.  I love her appearance.  She is tastefully and immaculately dressed in respectable, tidy tweed.  She is prim and proper as befits her sensibilities, age, and station. Her hats are wonderfully subdued and suit her perfectly.  There is nothing silly, stereotypical, fussy, or frilly about her.  She is very much no-nonsense and rather stern. While she does give the impression of an old, scatty, and slightly doddering nosey parker; upon further observation this is a false impression.  I like how there is nothing ridiculous about her. She is undaunted by the judgment of those foolish enough to underestimate her.  In fact, she uses people's propensity for writing her off, by their first impression of her, to her advantage.  She plays the nosey-old-lady card at every opportunity.I also adore Hickson's voice and elocution.  She has a deliberate and measured way of expressing herself and the script delivers the usage of outstanding vocabulary; she speaks in a formal style. She is in no way frivolous in her speech.  She does not banter or blather!  And her facial expressions are marvelous! Her steady blue gaze burns a hole right through her doubters and naysayers. She unflinchingly stares down the most intimidating of killers.  She observes everything, is a ""noticing sort,"" and misses nothing. Miss Jane's mind is razor sharp like a ""bacon slicer.""Colonel Melchett, very familiar with Jane's ability, calls her redoubtable and further says, ""...she has a forensic intuition that is developed to the point of brilliance.""  Once you get to know her and how her mind operates, you will agree completely with Melchett and learn that her village parallels make perfect sense!  (Trust me, even Tommy Bond, the frog, the clock, and Mrs. Martin will make sense in the end.)We are introduced to Sir Henry Clithering the very influential and powerful retired Chief of the CID of the Met.  Sir Henry's name will pop up throughout the Miss Marple mysteries.  Clithering is a longtime admirer of Miss Marple's keen mind.  He lends credence and respect to her ""interference"" in most of the murders she solves and prevents.  In fact, he says of her, ""She is one of the most formidable criminologists in England.  I would lay you almost any odds that you would not recognize her as such.  An elderly spinster, sweet, placid or so you would think, yet her mind has plumbed the depths of human iniquity and taken it all in a day's work.  She knows the world through the prism of her little village and its daily life.  By knowing the village so thoroughly she seems to know the world.""Even under pressure from Jane's advocates, Sir Henry and Colonel Melchett, Inspector Slack does not jump on the Miss Marple Bandwagon.  He smirks and politely gives her the time of day only because he is made to do so.  So Slack, condescendingly listens (as instructed) but doesn't go so far as to take anything Jane offers seriously. After all, she's a ""flaming amateur."" In all fairness to Slack, he doesn't know Jane yet, and has no way of knowing that she's anything more than her misleading appearance. He is definitely not the only one, the culprits are also lulled into a false sense of security by what she seems to be! And then there's that thing she does, spouting seemingly dotty village comparisons, which give the impression that she must be quite doolally!  But don't you be taken in for a minute.  You will regret it.  The guilty and Inspector Slack certainly end up doing so!All the characters are brilliantly portrayed.  Inspector ""Gotcha!"" Slack's reactions to Miss Marple are priceless and so entertaining.  A bit of humor in the midst of murder. I'm happy to say that you will see him again in; Murder at the Vicarage; (where he is still not on the Marple-band-wagon); 4:50 From Paddington (still not there yet); They Do It With Mirrors (getting there), and The Mirror Crack'd From Side to Side (finally there.)  He is stubborn, believes she is just lucky, and he's a slow learner.  Note: Slack is in the Joan Hickson versions only.The solution to who killed young Ruby Keene isn't immediate.  This film is 2 hours and 22 minutes long.  There are clues to whodunit but they are definitely not a trail of breadcrumbs.  In figuring out this puzzle, the only question you have to ask yourself is; what in the world have Mozart and fingernails got to do with anything?A Murder is Announced:In the Chipping Clegghorn Gazette a murder is announced.  It is to take place at Little Paddocks at 7:00 PM.  A collective gasp runs through the village at the prospect of attending a murder.  We are introduced to the characters of the story as they read this announcement in the Gazette.  What does it mean?  ""It means a drink! Probably bad sherry."" Or so thinks Miss Hinchcliffe.  The simple prospect of a drink, even bad sherry is enough to stir her interest. She will attend!  In addition to Hinchcliffe, we meet: Murgatroid; Edmond Sweatenham and his mother Mrs. Sweatenham; Colonel and Mrs. Easterbrook; Vicar  and Mrs. Harmon (who just happens to be Miss Marple's niece--how convenient!) After reading the advertisement, all are intrigued and plan to attend the murder.  The only problem is that the people living at Little Paddocks know nothing about it!  As they too sit around their morning table reading the Gazette, they wonder what is going on, and who in the world would post such an ad!  The young Patrick Simmons, who ""fancies himself a joker"" is instantly suspected by the mistress of the home, Miss Leticia Blacklock.  Nope, he denies it.  As does his sister, Julia, ""who just fancies herself."" Miss Dora Bunner, companion to Miss Blacklock, is very sweet but ""scatty"" and obviously not the culprit.  Also ruled out are the two other occupants of the household, the ""boringly anonymous"", lodger, Mrs. Phillippa Haymes and the ""crazy"", foreign cook, Hannah. So, what does Leticia Blacklock think it means?  With resignation, she says it means that, ""Half the village of Chipping Clegghorn will arrive at seven o'clock.""  She then goes to make sure there is a bottle of sherry in the pantry. Probably bad sherry.As expected, just prior to the announced time of seven p.m., all of the above (except the vicar, he has a confirmation class) are gathered at Little Paddocks enjoying the central heating and awaiting the countdown to the murder. The clock begins to chime seven and just as Patrick and Phillippa get ready to serve the sherry, there is a crackling noise and the lights go out!  There are excited exclamations, then the door bursts open, a torch shines about into the pitch black room, dazzling everyone, and the intruder shouts, ""Stick-em-up! Stick-em-up, I tell you!""  All seem to think it's quite fun and pretty impressive until three shots are fired.  When the lights come back on there is blood dripping from a grazing bullet wound in Leticia Blacklock's ear...and yes, wouldn't you know it someone is killed. But...was it suicide, an accident or murder?  Murder! Of course! Who says there is no truth in advertising? So who was this masked intruder and why was he shooting at Miss Blacklock?Miss Marple becomes involved in the case when she is recommended to Inspector Craddock by another appreciative higher-up in the constabulary.  Upon Craddock contacting her, she forthwith invites herself to stay with the Harmons and before you can say ""Bob's your uncle,"" she is on the case, using her nosey-old-lady disguise to get the information that everyone is not sharing with Inspector Craddock.  Needless to say, she turns Inspector Craddock's hypotheses inside out and upside down, and rightly so! Agatha Christie is brilliant in weaving a masterpiece mystery with the most interesting characters.  This is another lengthy offering clocking in at 2 hours and 34 minutes.A Pocketful of Rye:""Sing a song of sixpence, a pocketful of rye.  Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie...""  This old, children's ditty is the central theme in the murder of wealthy and prominent financier Rex Fortescue, who dies while in his office, ""his counting house,"" and what's this? he has a pocket full of rye.  He has been poisoned with taxin derived from the yew tree.When Fortescue's murder hits the papers, Miss Marple is notified of his death by a helpful neighbor because a girl Jane has trained, Gladys Martin, works as a maid for the Fortescue family.  Upon learning this, Miss Marple begins following the drama.When a second murder, connected to Rex Fortescue occurs, Jane hears about it on the wireless.  Out of concern for Gladys, Miss Marple hurries to the scene.  Her taxi is met at the gates of Yew Tree Lodge, the grandiose home of the Fortescue family. Jane is denied entrance; all visitors must be vetted.  Due to Miss Marple's connection being ""only"" to the maid, her request for entrance is not considered necessary, and she is denied entrance.  Refusing to leave, she insists upon sending a scrawled message to Inspector Neale who is heading up the investigation.  Her message is brief, ""Sing a song of sixpence.""  After reading the note, Inspector Neale completely dismisses her with the comment, ""I think the old girl's got an attic to rent..."" and shoves her note into his pocket to be forgotten.  Inspector Neale sends Sergeant Hay to the gate to send Miss Marple away but she insists on staying, certain that Gladys is in danger! Unfortunately, it isn't long before he is dragging Jane's note out of his pocket and she is asked inside; she's on the case!The characters involved in this interesting mystery are: Adele Fortescue, the ""young enough to be his daughter"" wife of two years to the murdered Rex; ""pettifogging clerk,"" Percy Fortescue, Rex's eldest son and his wife, the ""invisible"" Jennifer; the ""excellent, cool, and superior,"" housekeeper, Miss Dove; the feisty cook, Mrs. Crump and crotchety butler, Mr. Crump; Gladys ""the rabbit,"" the simple-minded maid; and Mrs. Henderson, the ""much addicted to Scripture,"" sister-in-law to the victim; all of whom live under the roof of Yew Tree Lodge. Returning to Yew Tree Lodge after several years absence, on the evening of his father's murder, is the prodigal son, Lance Fortescue and his good wife, Patricia.  And the final player in this drama is Viviene DuBois, golf instructor and special ""friend"" to Adele Fortescue.  Which of these committed this crime? Or wait, was it someone else?Also, what in the world have the nursery rhyme and blackbirds to do with anything?  Be sure, Miss Marple soon has it all figured out.  Inspector Neale finds himself saying to his sergeant, ""I'm beginning to wonder who is running this investigation."" Of course there is no mystery there, it is Miss Marple. Indeed.Some might say that the Hickson versions of Miss Marple are outdated.  I would agree that the images are not as crisp as today's high definition technology delivers.  I love them anyway but can see why an attempt at updating these stories was a good idea and attempted.  Christie's mysteries are a treasure and should be seen by generations to come.  However, I don't go along with tampering with the characters and story lines of the originals.  This set is in keeping with Christie's writing, the sensibilities of the era in which the stories were written, and the period of time depicted. I recommend the Hickson versions above all other Miss Marple films to date.While the subject matter is murder, I appreciate that there are no detailed autopsies. There are no sex scenes or bad language; adult situations, however, are presented.",5,The Redoubtable Miss Marple,1379548800,"09 19, 2013",2013,14519,"['**No', 'Spoilers**The', 'Body', 'Library',

706092,A3USRUCHAOC3MT,B000068UE9,"Indiana Jeff Reynolds ""Preacher Jeff""","[1, 1]","This is a collection of three Miss Marple mysteries, plus a half hour documentary billed as Miss Marple meets Hercule Poirot. One difference between this and the other Marple series (both the other Hickson collections and the Acorn Media versions with Geraldine McEwan and Julia McKenzie) is that they appear to be aired as multi-part TV series episodes as opposed to movies. The first two thus are longer, 150 minutes compared to the 100 minutes of the third one and the movies. For ""A Murder Is Announced"", that longer setting was perfect; for ""The Body in the Library"", there is some filler -- it's too long for the 100 minute format, but not enough for the extra 50 minutes.Joan Hickson was the fourth Miss Marple I've seen (Angela Lansbury, McKenzie, and McEwan were the other three), and through watching her versions I do concur she's the best (though McKenzie is almost as good). I have seen both Hickson's and McKenzie's version of two stories (""They Do It With Mirrors"" and ""A Pocketful of Rye"", the latter included here). While I lean with McKenzie's on ""Mirrors"", I liked Hickson's ""A Pocketful of Rye"" here based on the acting and the way the story is told.The half-hour special in reality is a documentary of the festivities for Christie's 100th birthday at her birthplace, and one of those included a first time meeting of Hercule Poirot (David Suchet) and Miss Marple (Hickson; it was a first-time meeting for the actors as well). That event that got billing on the cover received two minutes in the documentary. I would have enjoyed it more if they had the actors in character discussing Christie's writings.Not perfect, but if you enjoy dramatizations of Christie's works, I'd add this (but not a body) to your library.",5,"If you're a Miss Marple Fan, this is a needed part of the collection.",1378684800,"09 9, 2013",2013,1737,"['collection', 'three', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'mysteries', 'half', 'hour', 'documentary', 'billed', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'meets', 'Hercule', 'Poirot', 'One', 'difference', 'other', 'Marple', 'series', 'other', 'Hickson', 'collections', 'Acorn', 'Media', 'versions', 'Geraldine', 'McEwan', 'Julia', 'McKenzie', 'appear', 'be', 'aired', 'multi-part', 'TV', 'series', 'opposed', 'movies', 'first', 'two', 'thus', 'are', 'longer', '150', 'minutes', 'compared', '100', 'minutes', 'third', 'one', 'movies', 'A', 'Murder', 'Is', 'Announced', 'longer', 'setting', 'was', 'perfect', 'Body', 'Library', 'filler', 'too', 'long', '100', 'minute', 'format', 'not', 'enough', 'extra', '50', 'minutes.Joan', 'Hickson', 'was', 'fourth', 'Miss', 'Marple', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'McKenzie', 'McEwan', 'were', 'other', 'three', 'watching', 'versions', 'do', 'concur', 'best', 'McKenzie', 'almost', 'good', 'have', 'seen', 'Hickson', 'McKenzie', 'version', 'two', 'stories', 'Do', 'Mirrors', 'Pocketful', 'Rye', 'latter', 'included', 'here', 'lean', 'McKenzie', 'Mirrors', 'liked', 'Hickson', 'A', 'Pocketful', 'Rye', 'here', 'based', 'acting', 'way', 'story', 'told.The', 'half-hour', 'special', 'reality', 'documentary', 'festivities', 'Christie', '100th', 'birthday', 'birthplace', 'one', 'included', 'first', 'time', 'meeting', 'Hercule', 'Poirot', 'David', 'Suchet', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'Hickson', 'was', 'first-time', 'meeting', 'actors', 'well', 'event', 'got', 'billing', 'cover', 'received', 'two', 'minutes', 'documentary', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'had', 'actors', 'character', 'discussing', 'Christie', 'writings.Not', 'perfect', 'enjoy', 'dramatizations', 'Christie', 'works', ""'d"", 'add', 'not', 'body', 'library']",Miss Marple - 3 Feature Length Mysteries (The Body in the Library / A Murder Is Announced / A Pocketful of Rye)

This BBC/Warner Brothers set is a better quality product than A&E;'s, but they are the only way to have the entire series.  This classic show deserves a new release with improved picture and sound quality.  As it is now the sound and picture are good but the camera work is so beautiful it deserves the best possible cleaning up, and the musical score is ingenious for a television production.This episode, A Murder is Announced, is perfectly cast.  But then the whole series is excellently cast.  Older stars lead in this episode.  Ursula Howells, not very well-known in the USA but one of the fine actresses from the 40s and 50s in England, Renee Asherson, Olivier's Queen Catherine in Henry V, and Joan Sims, the true queen of the Carry On movies, anchor down the eclectic team.  John Castle is a very appealing Inspector Derwent Craddock.  And there is the masterful Joan Hickson's Miss Marple, as always.  What a great comedienne she was.  Her long turtle-like head with those beady little blue eyes and wry twisted mouth speak volumes without seeming to do anything at all but peer or perhaps muse on something in her mind.  There is usually a great character part written in to these episodes, and in A Murder is Announced we are introduced to a classic ""foreigner in England"" named Hannah.  She is a refugee from Hitler's Europe and appears to have fled from someplace like Transylvania or Albania.  Elaine Ives-Cameron is over the top but perfectly so.A Pocket Full of Rye is very funny yet possesses its poignancies in one of the deaths.  A horrid nouveau-riche family, the Fortescues, are a nutty collection of vile people, the kind who cropped up in England and America after the war, fancied themselves aristos when all they were were glorified hillbillies.Miss Marple is especially acid in her quiet remarks about the house to which she has come to seek out the killer of poor Gladys, the housemaid who Miss Marple had trained in St Mary Mead.  Charm and ghoulishness, as usual, are all tossed together, with black humor, dry acerbic to make this my favorite of the entire series.Inspector Neal is performed with boyish charm and gentleness by a young and handsome Tom Wilkinson.  A veritable post-war Prince Charming.  There are two outstanding comedic performances from Selina Cadell as Miss Dove and Annette Badland as poor Gladys Martin, the housemaid.  Cadell is like a tainted Snow White who is first seen gazing at herself in a mirror.  Miss Dove is played with an unflappable aplomb and clear-eyed menace, it's a very funny performance by an actress who shows huge comedic talent in a difficult role.Poor Gladys Martin is a simple country girl who has little choice in life other than to be one of the last of the old-fashioned housemaids of the lowest order.  She is a good girl but she's also an imbecile.  However, Gladys is a brilliantly written character and is hilariously performned with a ponderous twitching quality by Annette Badland.Her Poor Gladys is my favorite housemaid of all in this series.  Frank Mills is the lugubriously oily butler of the new age (England after WW2).The Body in the Library is a more famous Christie story and this is, like the rest of the series, the best adaptation of a Marple story you can get on film.  Great supporting work from Moray Watson and Gwen Watford as the Bantry's.David Horovitz's Inspector Craddock is very prickling and conceited and arrogant but somehow he's likable, and he does occasionally unbend to Miss Marple, who he refers to as ""that nice grey cobra"".Get this series while you can because I don't think, the way things are going, there may ever be another, improved, release of Hickson's Miss Marple, which is sad.",5,Three of the best of the great BBC Marple series,1299024000,"03 2, 2011",2011,3833,"['Here', 'are', 'three', 'episodes', 'Hickson/Marple', 'series', '1980s', 'were', 'not', 'part', 'A', 'E', 'release', 'other', 'nine', 'BBC/Warner', 'Brothers', 'set', 'better', 'quality', 'product', 'A', 'E', 'are', 'only', 'way', 'have', 'entire', 'series', 'classic', 'show', 'new', 'release', 'improved', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'now', 'sound', 'picture', 'are', 'good', 'camera', 'work', 'so', 'beautiful', 'best', 'possible', 'cleaning', 'up', 'musical', 'score', 'ingenious', 'television', 'production.This', 'episode', 'Murder', 'Announced', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'then', 'whole', 'series', 'excellently', 'cast', 'Older', 'stars', 'lead', 'episode', 'Ursula', 'Howells', 'not', 'very', 'well-known', 'USA', 'one', 'fine', 'actresses', '40s', '50s', 'England', 'Renee', 'Asherson', 'Olivier', 'Queen', 'Catherine', 'Henry', 'V', 'Joan', 'Sims', 'true', 'queen', 'Carry', 'movies', 'anchor', 'down', 'eclectic', 'team', 'John', 'Castle', 'very', 'appealing', 'Inspector', 'Derwent', 'Craddock', 'masterful', 'Joan', 'Hickson', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'always', 'What', 'great', 'comedienne', 'was', 'long', 'turtle-like', 'head', 'beady', 'little', 'blue', 'eyes', 'wry', 'twisted', 'mouth', 'speak', 'volumes', 'seeming', 'do', 'anything', 'peer', 'perhaps', 'muse', 'something', 'mind', 'usually', 'great', 'character', 'part', 'written', 'episodes', 'A', 'Murder', 'Announced', 'are', 'introduced', 'classic', 'foreigner', 'England', 'named', 'Hannah', 'refugee', 'Hitler', 'Europe', 'have', 'fled', 'someplace', 'Transylvania', 'Albania', 'Elaine', 'Ives-Cameron', 'top', 'perfectly', 'so.A', 'Pocket', 'Full', 'Rye', 'very', 'funny', 'yet', 'poignancies', 'one', 'deaths', 'horrid', 'nouveau-riche', 'family', 'Fortescues', 'are', 'nutty', 'collection', 'vile', 'people', 'kind', 'who', 'cropped', 'up', 'England', 'America', 'war', 'fancied', 'aristos', 'when', 'were', 'were', 'glorified', 'hillbillies.Miss', 'Marple', 'especially', 'acid', 'quiet', 'remarks', 'house', 'come', 'seek', 'out', 'killer', 'poor', 'Gladys', 'housemaid', 'who', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'had', 'trained', 'St', 'Mary', 'Mead', 'Charm', 'ghoulishness', 'usual', 'are', 'tossed', 'together', 'black', 'humor', 'dry', 'acerbic', 'make', 'favorite', 'entire', 'series.Inspector', 'Neal', 'performed', 'boyish', 'charm', 'gentleness', 'young', 'handsome', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'veritable', 'post-war', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'are', 'two', 'outstanding', 'comedic', 'performances', 'Selina', 'Cadell', 'Miss', 'Dove', 'Annette', 'Badland', 'poor', 'Gladys', 'Martin', 'housemaid', 'Cadell', 'tainted', 'Snow', 'White', 'who', 'first', 'seen', 'gazing', 'mirror', 'Miss', 'Dove', 'played', 'unflappable', 'aplomb', 'clear-eyed', 'menace', 'very', 'funny', 'performance', 'actress', 'who', 'huge', 'comedic', 'talent', 'difficult', 'role.Poor', 'Gladys', 'Martin', 'simple', 'country', 'girl', 'who', 'little', 'choice', 'life', 'other', 'be', 'one', 'last', 'old-fashioned', 'housemaids', 'lowest', 'order', 'good', 'girl', 'also', 'imbecile', 'However', 'Gladys', 'brilliantly', 'written', 'character', 'hilariously', 'performned', 'ponderous', 'twitching', 'quality', 'Annette', 'Badland.Her', 'Poor', 'Gladys', 'favorite', 'housemaid', 'series', 'Frank', 'Mills', 'lugubriously', 'oily', 'butler', 'new', 'age', 'England', 'WW2', '.The', 'Body', 'Library', 'more', 'famous', 'Christie', 'story', 'rest', 'series', 'best', 'adaptation', 'Marple', 'story', 'can', 'get', 'film', 'Great', 'supporting', 'work', 'Moray', 'Watson', 'Gwen', 'Watford', ""Bantry's.David"", 'Horovitz', 'Inspector', 'Craddock', 'very', 'prickling', 'conceited', 'arrogant', 'likable', 'occasionally', 'unbend', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'who', 'nice', 'grey', 'cobra', '.Get', 'series', 'can', 'because', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'way', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'may', 'ever', 'be', 'improved', 'release', 'Hickson', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'sad']",Miss Marple - 3 Feature Length Mysteries (The Body in the Library / A Murder Is Announced / A Pocketful of Rye)

Cheryl Campbell in Murder at the Vicarage is priceless when she says of her cook's pastries, ""Mary takes her rock cakes rather literally, I'm afraid.""With the upcoming release of a ""younger"" Sherlock Holmes series and a new Pride and Prejudice featuring a very contemporary actress, it seems the excellent and fairly recent productions of classic works are now being redone to make them more ""politcally correct"" and appealing to younger consumers.Which is no crime, as long as the editions made in the 80's and 90's are still available for helpful comparisons.

706105,A9CRL5P1MG0HD,B000068UE9,revit,"[0, 0]","By: RevitAgatha Christie's, Miss Marple, staring Joan Hickson and produced by BBC TV Production consists of three feature length movies on 3 discs, each in an individual plastic folder. Joan Hickson is by far the best and only genuine Miss Marple. Agatha Christie selected her for the part and Joan Hickson created the image of Miss Marple that fits the character of the subject to perfection. Others have tried to play the part, and a few have gotten close, but regardless of their qualifications as actresses, none of them have equaled the true image of Miss Marple, a spinster living in St. Mary Mead, that was created by Agatha Christie and portrayed by Joan Hickson. It seems odd to say this about a murder mystery, but you will find yourself fully enjoying every minute of a Miss Marple mystery, she can communicate more with the blink of her eye than you can imagine. When top level brass at Scotland Yard tells their Chief Inspectors to stop in to see Miss Marple you won't be able to resist a big grin.The 3 mysteries in this set include,The Body in the Library (No. 40, 1942): In the early morning at Gossington Hall, Dolly Bantry was languishing in bed when she was startled by the hysterical shouts of her house maid ""Oh ma'am, oh ma'am there's a body in the library"". At the unusual hour of 7:45 am Jane Marple's phone began ringing; the caller said it's Dolly Bantry. The official investigation is taken over by Inspector Slack. But soon Miss Marple is brought in by an old friend of hers who has retired from a high post at Scotland Yard and is convinced that only Jane Marple will find the correct solution.A Murder is Announced (No. 52, 1950):-One Friday morning, on October 29th the personals column of the Chipping Cleghorn Gazette carried a very unusual advertisement: ""A murder is announced and will take place on Friday, October 29th at Little Paddocks, at 6:30 pm. A little before the appointed time the guests began to arrive, soon the small room was full. At 6:30 the lights went out, a door opened and the beam of a flash light searched around the room. A voice called out: ""stick `em up!"" Two gunshots followed. Then there was a third gun shot, and the intruder's body slumped to the floor. After the usual interrogation, Chief Inspector Craddock and Jane Marple teamed up to solve the case.A Pocket Full of Rye: (No. 58, 1953): Rex Fortescue, an investment trust executive, went into painful, spasmodic movement caused by taxine poisoning while he was having his morning tea at his office. Curiously he was found to have a pocket full of rye grain. There was a second murder while the victim was eating bread with honey. The third murder was of a recently hired maid hanging out the clothes in her garden. The body had a clothes pin on its nose. That was enough to summon Miss Marple who had trained the maid.The king was in his counting house, counting out his money,The queen was in the parlor, eating bread and honey,The maid was in the garden, hanging out the clothes,When there came a little dickey bird and nipped off her nose.This set of three Miss Marple mysteries together with the nine Miss Marple mysteries in The Classic Collection, which I previously discussed and reviewed, will complete your set of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple Movies until the time that BBC decides to make more movies of the queen of mysteries stories. In the mean time sit back and fully enjoy these twelve Miss Marple mysteries, I know that you will love them.",5,Joan Hickson is the genuine Miss Maple,1391817600,"02 8, 2014",2014,3475,"['RevitAgatha', 'Christie', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'staring', 'Joan', 'Hickson', 'produced', 'BBC', 'TV', 'Production', 'three', 'feature', 'length', 'movies', '3', 'discs', 'individual', 'plastic', 'folder', 'Joan', 'Hickson', 'far', 'best', 'only', 'genuine', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'selected', 'part', 'Joan', 'Hickson', 'created', 'image', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'character', 'subject', 'perfection', 'Others', 'have', 'tried', 'play', 'part', 'few', 'have', 'gotten', 'close', 'regardless', 'qualifications', 'actresses', 'none', 'have', 'equaled', 'true', 'image', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'spinster', 'living', 'St.', 'Mary', 'Mead', 'was', 'created', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'portrayed', 'Joan', 'Hickson', 'odd', 'say', 'murder', 'mystery', 'will', 'find', 'fully', 'enjoying', 'minute', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'mystery', 'can', 'communicate', 'more', 'blink', 'eye', 'can', 'imagine', 'When', 'top', 'level', 'brass', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'Chief', 'Inspectors', 'stop', 'see', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'resist', 'big', 'grin.The', '3', 'mysteries', 'set', 'include', 'Body', 'Library', 'No', '40', '1942', 'early', 'morning', 'Gossington', 'Hall', 'Dolly', 'Bantry', 'was', 'languishing', 'bed', 'when', 'was', 'startled', 'hysterical', 'shouts', 'house', 'maid', 'Oh', ""ma'am"", 'oh', ""ma'am"", 'body', 'library', 'unusual', 'hour', '7:45', 'am', 'Jane', 'Marple', 'phone', 'began', 'ringing', 'caller', 'said', 'Dolly', 'Bantry', 'official', 'investigation', 'taken', 'over', 'Inspector', 'Slack', 'soon', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'brought', 'old', 'friend', 'hers', 'who', 'retired', 'high', 'post', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'convinced', 'only', 'Jane', 'Marple', 'will', 'find', 'correct', 'solution.A', 'Murder', 'Announced', 'No', '52', '1950', '-One', 'Friday', 'morning', 'October', '29th', 'personals', 'column', 'Chipping', 'Cleghorn', 'Gazette', 'carried', 'very', 'unusual', 'advertisement', 'murder', 'announced', 'will', 'take', 'place', 'Friday', 'October', '29th', 'Little', 'Paddocks', '6:30', 'pm', 'little', 'appointed', 'time', 'guests', 'began', 'arrive', 'soon', 'small', 'room', 'was', 'full', '6:30', 'lights', 'went', 'out', 'door', 'opened', 'beam', 'flash', 'light', 'searched', 'room', 'voice', 'called', 'out', 'stick', 'em', 'up', 'Two', 'gunshots', 'followed', 'Then', 'was', 'third', 'gun', 'shot', 'intruder', 'body', 'slumped', 'floor', 'usual', 'interrogation', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Craddock', 'Jane', 'Marple', 'teamed', 'up', 'solve', 'case.A', 'Pocket', 'Full', 'Rye', 'No', '58', '1953', 'Rex', 'Fortescue', 'investment', 'trust', 'executive', 'went', 'painful', 'spasmodic', 'movement', 'caused', 'taxine', 'poisoning', 'was', 'having', 'morning', 'tea', 'office', 'Curiously', 'was', 'found', 'have', 'pocket', 'full', 'rye', 'grain', 'was', 'second', 'murder', 'victim', 'was', 'eating', 'bread', 'honey', 'third', 'murder', 'was', 'recently', 'hired', 'maid', 'hanging', 'out', 'clothes', 'garden', 'body', 'had', 'clothes', 'pin', 'nose', 'was', 'enough', 'summon', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'who', 'had', 'trained', 'maid.The', 'king', 'was', 'counting', 'house', 'counting', 'out', 'money', 'queen', 'was', 'parlor', 'eating', 'bread', 'honey', 'maid', 'was', 'garden', 'hanging', 'out', 'clothes', 'When', 'came', 'little', 'dickey', 'bird', 'nipped', 'off', 'nose.This', 'set', 'three', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'together', 'nine', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'mysteries', 'Classic', 'Collection', 'previously', 'discussed', 'reviewed', 'will', 'complete', 'set', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'Movies', 'time', 'BBC', 'make', 'more', 'movies', 'queen', 'mysteries', 'stories', 'mean', 'time', 'sit', 'back', 'fully', 'enjoy', 'twelve', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'mysteries', 'know', 'will', 'love']",Miss Marple - 3 Feature Length Mysteries (The Body in the Library / A Murder Is Announced / A Pocketful of Rye)

The individual disk decor is lovely, with photos from the particular installment, and the disks contain chaptering of the installments (you can elect to view all three eps on disk 1 & 2 in one go or do it on an individual basis).  The real drawback with high irritation factor is the BBC-A ads that appear at the beginning of each disk, you can fast-forward through both, but really they shouldn't be there at all.  One point of possible confusion is John Castle, who played Miss Marple's inspector nephew elsewhere is actually an inspector of non-relation in A MURDER IS ANNOUNCED.  The introduction of the Inspector Slagg character, who resented Miss Marple's detecting skills, is introduced in BODY IN THE LIBRARY.  There is also - on Disk 3 - which contains the two-parter of POCKETFUL OF RYE - a half-hour documentary on the birthplace of Agatha Christie celebrating the centenary of her birth.

706112,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,B000068UE9,Themis-Athena,"[14, 14]","... so you'd think,"" retired Scotland Yard chief Sir Henry Clithering (Raymond Francis) says when describing St. Mary Mead's best-known inhabitant to his friend, wealthy paraplegic Conway Jefferson in the first adaptation of a Miss Marple mystery, ""The Body in the Library."" ""Yet,"" Sir Henry continues, ""her mind has plumbed the depths of human iniquity, and taken all in a day's work."" And Vicar Clement, the narrator of Agatha Christie's first Miss Marple story, 1930's ""Murder at the Vicarage,"" couldn't agree more: ""Miss Marple is a white-haired old lady with a gentle, appealing manner - Miss Wetherby is a mixture of vinegar and gush. Of the two Miss Marple is the more dangerous,"" he observes on one occasion.The BBC's 1980s adaptations of Christie's twelve Miss Marple novels quickly established Joan Hickson as the quintessential Jane Marple, even in the view of the grandmother (or rather, grand-aunt) of all village sleuths and ""noticing kinds of persons""'s creator, Dame Agatha herself. (After seeing Hickson in an adaptation of her ""Appointment With Death,"" as early as 1946 Christie reportedly sent her a note expressing the hope she would ""play my dear Miss Marple."") Prior versions, partly involving rather high-octane casts, had seen as Miss Marple, inter alia, Angela Lansbury and Margaret Rutherford, but had been less faithful to Christie's books. While Lansbury holds her own fairly well when compared to the character's literary original in 1980's ""Hollywood does Christie"" adaptation of ""The Mirror Crack'd"" (and that movie's ageing actresses' showdown featuring Elizabeth Taylor and Kim Novak is a delight to watch) the four movies starring Rutherford are only loosely based on Christie's books: Dame Margaret's Miss Marple, although itself likewise a splendid performance, has about as much to do with Agatha Christie's demure, seemingly scatterbrained village sleuth as Big Ben does with the English countryside, and of the scripts, only ""Murder, She Said"" is an adaptation of a Miss Marple mystery (""4:50 From Paddington""), whereas two of the others -- ""Murder at the Gallop"" and ""Murder Most Foul"" -- are actually Hercule Poirot stories (""After the Funeral"" and ""Mrs. McGinty's Dead,"" respectively), and ""Murder Ahoy"" is based on a completely independent screenplay.Following the rule that ever since Sherlock Holmes and Inspector Lestrade every great private detective needs a policeman he can outwit, the creators of the BBC series inserted the character of Milchester C.I.D.'s Inspector Slack (David Horovitch) into almost all storylines -- hardly in keeping with the literary originals, which are set over a period of more than 30 years and thus, exceed the career span of a policeman already advanced on his professional path at the time of his first encounter with Miss Marple; even if the BBC's Slack is promoted from D.I. in ""The Body in the Library"" (where he really does appear) to Superintendent in the adaptation of ""The Mirror Crack'd"" (where Miss Marple is actually only joined by Inspector Craddock, not also by Slack). Yet, Hickson's and Horovitch's face-offs are a fun addition; and one is almost ready to pity Slack, who hardly ever gets a foot down vis-a-vis Miss Marple's quick rejoinders and, in the words of Sir Henry Clithering, ""wonderful gift to state the obvious"" ... and whose ""good old-fashioned policework"" is found to fall short, again and again, in comparison with Miss Marple's ever-unfailing ""village parallels,"" those seemingly innocuous incidents of village life making up the sum of her knowledge of human nature, to which she routinely turns in unmasking even the cleverest killer.This set contains the region 1 versions of the BBC's first three adaptations starring Joan Hickson:""The Body in the Library"" (written 1942, BBC 1984): In response to a friend's request, Christie makes a mysterious dead platinum blonde appear in the library of St. Mary Mead squire Colonel Bantry and his wife Dolly, Miss Marple's friend. (The horror!  The scandal!) The murderer's trail leads from the Bantrys' Gossington Hall estate to nearby seaside resort Danemouth, when the dead girl is identified as a show dancer who used to work at one of the resort's luxury hotels. But as Mrs. Bantry will come to observe to her surprise in the end, ""it all boils down to fingernail clippings and Mozart"" ...""A Murder Is Announced"" (written 1950, BBC 1985): It was supposed to be ""just a silly joke,"" that startling anonymous advertisement in Chipping Cleghorn's village gazette -- ""A murder is announced and will take place Friday, October the 5th, at Little Paddocks, at 7PM."" But then a murder really does occur, and the person found lying dead is the ad's author himself.  In determining his connection to Little Paddocks's owner Ms. Blacklog -- his failed holdup's apparent target -- Miss Marple and Inspector Craddock (John Castle) ponder the effects of the post-WWII changes of British village society ... and the vital clue is finally provided by a remarkable cat named Delilah.""A Pocket Full of Rye"" (written 1953, BBC also 1985):  A murderer uses an old nursery rhyme in a ghastly game with rich tyrannical Rex Fortescue and his family which soon has police and press speculate about black magic.  Miss Marple, however, instantly zeroes in on the nursery rhyme, and finding that she has come too late to save the life of her erstwhile protege, the Fortescues' clumsy, naive maid Gladys, she does not rest until she has found the murderer, whose motive is, alas, nothing but ""greed -- one knows that, naturally ...""The series's remaining episodes (available in a variety of other sets):""Murder

706113,A2BJ81NT43LKSM,B000068UE9,"Toki Mike ""amateur polymath""","[3, 3]","As an Agatha Christie addict, I enjoy both Hercule Poirot and Miss Jane Marple stories. Each of these 3 stories, starring Joan Hickson, are clever and confusing, as Miss Marple has to solve ingenious murder plots, such as a murder's time and place being announced in a newspaper.  She always gets her man (or woman) in spite of the handicap that police inspectors don't want an old spinster like her interfering in their murder investigations.Several Miss Marple mysteries have been filmed more than once with different actresses playing Miss Marple.  Agatha Christie herself wanted Joan Hickson to play Miss Marple.  Not only is Joan Hickson a marvelous actress, but other versions of these mysteries have tinkered with the stories to ""sex them up"" and to make them ""more exciting"", which often causes flaws to appear in Christie's ingenious plots.  If you enjoy clever murder mysteries, you can't do better than Joan Hickson playing Miss Marple (unless it's David Suchet playing Hercule Poirot).",5,Wonderful Versions of the last 3 Miss Marple Mysteries,1306713600,"05 30, 2011",2011,997,"['Agatha', 'Christie', 'addict', 'enjoy', 'Hercule', 'Poirot', 'Miss', 'Jane', 'Marple', 'stories', '3', 'stories', 'starring', 'Joan', 'Hickson', 'are', 'clever', 'confusing', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'solve', 'ingenious', 'murder', 'plots', 'such', 'murder', 'time', 'place', 'being', 'announced', 'newspaper', 'always', 'man', 'woman', 'spite', 'handicap', 'police', 'inspectors', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'old', 'spinster', 'interfering', 'murder', 'investigations.Several', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'mysteries', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'more', 'once', 'different', 'actresses', 'playing', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'wanted', 'Joan', 'Hickson', 'play', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'Not', 'only', 'Joan', 'Hickson', 'marvelous', 'actress', 'other', 'versions', 'mysteries', 'have', 'tinkered', 'stories', 'sex', 'up', 'make', 'more', 'exciting', 'often', 'flaws', 'appear', 'Christie', 'ingenious', 'plots', 'enjoy', 'clever', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'better', 'Joan', 'Hickson', 'playing', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'David', 'Suchet', 'playing', 'Hercule', 'Poirot']",Miss Marple - 3 Feature Length Mysteries (The Body in the Library / A Murder Is Announced / A Pocketful of Rye)
