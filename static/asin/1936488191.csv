Jonathan Cahn writes a much better book and I highly recommend the book in The Harbinger.  I highly recommend the book.  It will keep you riveted.  Mr Cahn does not have a melodic voice, nor a voice that can hold one's interest.  He is more monotone and boring to listen to.  Perhaps it is because I read the book first and it was so very good, that I had great expectations for the film.  The film should have been created in a movie form, somewhat like the book was written, first person, with other people in the book, making the story line very interesting.  However, that would cost quite a bit, I suppose.  Nonetheless, the message is the same, and it's the message that gets the 5 stars.  I encourage everyone to please listen to the message, not the quality of the film.  Read the book, &#34;The Harbinger&#34; if you possibly can.

Mr. Cahn starts with a very simple premise which I and most Evangelical Christians believe. Just as Israel was and is, the United States has been chosen by God to be His people and God has blessed this nation abundantly over our history. Even the Revolutionary War reminds me of battles Israel was involved and the odds against her were so great that only God's divine intervention and plan were the reason for success.Mr. Cahn makes the case that the scripture Isaiah 9:10 is being played out again but this time in the USA. He makes the case step by step and makes a convincing argument that we are rebelling against God and because of that rebellion, God ALLOWED 9/11 to occur. Did not say God made it happen but He allowed it to happen. A huge difference. Our nation humbled itself before God during its founding and presented itself for the purpose of being missionaries to the world. Fast forward to the 1960's and we have done but tell God we know best.Mr. Cahn knows the Bible and while many might think he is misinterpuritng, I would ask, how do you know that and show me some proof.

195820,A3N95R1VKWROWF,1936488191,Christopher Schwinger,"[4, 6]","I don't jump on theories that there's a secret code within Biblical prophecy of when and how the world will end.  This documentary, based on Jonathan Cahn's book The Harbinger, does NOT peddle such a theory.  Rather, it shows the astounding parallels, down to the exact detail, between Isaiah 9:10 and the United States, which made Is 9:10 its official policy after 9/11.  Is 9:10 reads in the New International Version, ""The bricks have fallen down, but we will rebuild with dressed stone; the fig trees have been felled, but we will replace them with cedars.""  World Net Daily produced the video.  The articles by WND entitled ""The Isaiah 9:10 Judgment"", ""Bad Things Happen on This Date Every 7 Years"", and ""'Get Radical for God,' Says Bestselling Author"" cover the main subject matter of the documentary.The significance of Isaiah 9:10 is that Israel was boasting that God's chastisement through the Assyrians would not destroy them, that the sycamores (AKA fig trees) would be replaced by stronger coniferous trees, translated ""cedars"".  September 11's World Trade Center destruction felled a famous sycamore at Wall Street, at which the New York Stock Exchange was created in the Buttonwood Agreement--which I'd never heard of before watching this.  This documentary proposes that the sycamore on Wall Street embodies the US financial system.  After it was felled on 9/11, a coniferous tree was planted in its place, as a symbolic gesture of defiance against terrorists, but Cahn believes that response reflects the same attitude as Is 9:10, of self-reliance rather than reliance on God.  The coniferous tree replacing the sycamore on Wall Street is in poor shape today, unhealthy compared to all the trees around it, which Cahn also finds significant.  Additionally, when the sycamore was felled on 9/11, it shielded St. Paul's Chapel, where Washington dedicated the nation to God.  Federal Hall, where Washington's inauguration took place just before going to the chapel, was cracked at the foundation by 9/11, which Cahn believes symbolizes America's civil institutions in jeopardy.Tom Daschle, John Edwards, and Barack Obama have all uttered the message of Is 9:10, and the first two actually quoted directly from it as the basis of their speeches.  Seven years to the day, in our calendar, after Tom Daschle made Is 9:10 the US's official response to 9/11 on Sep 12, 2001, the Federal Reserve let Lehman Brothers fall, precipitating the economic crisis we're currently in.  The Hebrew calendar's Shmitah day, the day on which debts are supposed to be cleared, occurs every 7 years, intended to serve as a rededication of Israel's financial affairs to God.  The Shmitah takes place on 29 Elul in the Hebrew calendar.  Sep 17, 2001, which was 29 Elul, was the greatest stock market crash up to that time.  Sep 29, 2008, the next 29 Elul of a Shmitah year, broke the record of Sep 17, 2001, ruining 7% of Wall Street, a drop of 777 points.  Shmitah means ""release"" or ""letting collapse"".  Cahn proposes that if Americans don't give up their materialism voluntarily and turn to God (release it), He will let the economy collapse further on the next Shmitah.Rather than a code for how the world will end, Cahn is pointing to the circumstantial parallels between Is 9:10 and the United States, made all the more significant by the fact that the United States has thrice (from Daschle, Edwards, and Obama) made Is 9:10 our official national policy, which expresses self-confidence without relying on God.  His approach comes from his qualifications as a Messianic Jew, a Jewish Christian who knows the Old Testament very well.  It is well worth your while to investigate The Isaiah 9:10 Judgment.  I find Cahn's discovery as amazing as when the author of Hebrews in the New Testament saw Psalm 110's Melchizedek passage as significant.",5,Provocative - convinced me,1350172800,"10 14, 2012",2012,3838,"['do', ""n't"", 'jump', 'theories', 'secret', 'code', 'Biblical', 'prophecy', 'when', 'how', 'world', 'will', 'end', 'documentary', 'based', 'Jonathan', 'Cahn', 'book', 'Harbinger', 'NOT', 'peddle', 'such', 'theory', 'Rather', 'astounding', 'parallels', 'down', 'exact', 'detail', 'Isaiah', '9:10', 'United', 'States', 'made', '9:10', 'official', 'policy', '9/11', '9:10', 'reads', 'New', 'International', 'Version', 'bricks', 'have', 'fallen', 'down', 'will', 'rebuild', 'dressed', 'stone', 'fig', 'trees', 'have', 'been', 'felled', 'will', 'replace', 'cedars', 'World', 'Net', 'Daily', 'produced', 'video', 'articles', 'WND', 'entitled', 'Isaiah', '9:10', 'Judgment', 'Bad', 'Things', 'Happen', 'Date', 'Every', '7', 'Years', ""'Get"", 'Radical', 'God', 'Bestselling', 'Author', 'main', 'subject', 'matter', 'documentary.The', 'significance', 'Isaiah', '9:10', 'Israel', 'was', 'boasting', 'God', 'chastisement', 'Assyrians', 'would', 'not', 'destroy', 'sycamores', 'AKA', 'fig', 'trees', 'would', 'be', 'replaced', 'stronger', 'coniferous', 'trees', 'translated', 'cedars', 'September', '11', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'destruction', 'felled', 'famous', 'sycamore', 'Wall', 'Street', 'New', 'York', 'Stock', 'Exchange', 'was', 'created', 'Buttonwood', 'Agreement', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'before', 'watching', 'documentary', 'sycamore', 'Wall', 'Street', 'US', 'financial', 'system', 'was', 'felled', '9/11', 'coniferous', 'tree', 'was', 'planted', 'place', 'symbolic', 'gesture', 'defiance', 'terrorists', 'Cahn', 'response', 'same', 'attitude', '9:10', 'self-reliance', 'rather', 'reliance', 'God', 'coniferous', 'tree', 'replacing', 'sycamore', 'Wall', 'Street', 'poor', 'shape', 'today', 'unhealthy', 'compared', 'trees', 'Cahn', 'also', 'significant', 'Additionally', 'when', 'sycamore', 'was', 'felled', '9/11', 'shielded', 'St.', 'Paul', 'Chapel', 'where', 'Washington', 'dedicated', 'nation', 'God', 'Federal', 'Hall', 'where', 'Washington', 'inauguration', 'took', 'place', 'just', 'before', 'going', 'chapel', 'was', 'cracked', 'foundation', '9/11', 'Cahn', 'America', 'civil', 'institutions', 'jeopardy.Tom', 'Daschle', 'John', 'Edwards', 'Barack', 'Obama', 'have', 'uttered', 'message', 'Is', '9:10', 'first', 'two', 'actually', 'quoted', 'directly', 'basis', 'speeches', 'Seven', 'years', 'day', 'calendar', 'Tom', 'Daschle', 'made', '9:10', 'US', 'official', 'response', '9/11', 'Sep', '12', '2001', 'Federal', 'Reserve', 'let', 'Lehman', 'Brothers', 'fall', 'precipitating', 'economic', 'crisis', ""'re"", 'currently', 'Hebrew', 'calendar', 'Shmitah', 'day', 'day', 'debts', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'cleared', '7', 'years', 'intended', 'serve', 'rededication', 'Israel', 'financial', 'affairs', 'God', 'Shmitah', 'place', '29', 'Elul', 'Hebrew', 'calendar', 'Sep', '17', '2001', 'was', '29', 'Elul', 'was', 'greatest', 'stock', 'market', 'crash', 'up', 'time', 'Sep', '29', '2008', 'next', '29', 'Elul', 'Shmitah', 'year', 'broke', 'record', 'Sep', '17', '2001', 'ruining', '7', '%', 'Wall', 'Street', 'drop', '777', 'points', 'Shmitah', 'release', 'letting', 'collapse', 'Cahn', 'Americans', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'materialism', 'voluntarily', 'turn', 'God', 'release', 'will', 'let', 'economy', 'collapse', 'further', 'next', 'Shmitah.Rather', 'code', 'how', 'world', 'will', 'end', 'Cahn', 'pointing', 'circumstantial', 'parallels', 'Is', '9:10', 'United', 'States', 'made', 'more', 'significant', 'fact', 'United', 'States', 'thrice', 'Daschle', 'Edwards', 'Obama', 'made', '9:10', 'official', 'national', 'policy', 'self-confidence', 'relying', 'God', 'approach', 'qualifications', 'Messianic', 'Jew', 'Jewish', 'Christian', 'who', 'Old', 'Testament', 'very', 'well', 'well', 'worth', 'investigate', 'Isaiah', '9:10', 'Judgment', 'find', 'Cahn', 'discovery', 'as', 'amazing', 'when', 'author', 'Hebrews', 'New', 'Testament', 'saw', 'Psalm', '110', 'Melchizedek', 'passage', 'significant']",The Isaiah 9:10 Judgment: Is There an Ancient Mystery that Foretells America's Future?

195825,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,1936488191,David Bower,"[54, 57]","This is an interesting study on some very pertinent events in the recent history of the United States. Rabbi Cahn uses the verse in Isaiah 9:10 as a focus for his analysis of events in this country starting on September 11, 2001 with the destruction of the two World Trade Center towers representing the first shaking.The documentary is in two parts, ""The First Shaking"" and ""The Second Shaking"" on two DVD's. In the first Rabbi Cahn seeks to show how events after 9/11 followed a similar pattern to Israel's experience before their destruction at the hands of the Assyrians. The parallels are too close to appear coincidental and Rabbi Cahn presents strong arguments that these events are warnings from God.The information provided is interesting to anyone who is concerned about the future of this country and brings together in one place a cross section of information that applies to the events which occurred. The conclusion is we are following a similar path nationally and are being given a warning that the path we are following is the wrong one.If a national repentance does not come wherein we return to our dependency on the grace of God, judgment will surely follow and increase in intensity.The second DVD, ""The Second Shaking"" discusses the second warning from God as being the financial problems that have emerged and focuses on the events of September, 2008 including the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the stock market crash of 2008.The second DVD attempts to introduce a note of hope when Rabbi Cahn urges Christians to remember God's promise in 2 Corinthians 7:14. There may be a problem there because many believe that promise was only to Israel, not to the church. God gave Israel a land but He didn't give the church a land, He gave the church a heavenly city, The New Jerusalem.There is no real doubt that the United States is on an unsustainable path; if we continue on this path we are heading down a path toward our destruction as a nation. As students of prophecy have observed, the United States is conspicuously absent from Bible prophecy concerning the end times.It may well be we are observing the reasons for this as they play out in real life before us. It appears doubtful to me that the USA will be restored in the time left as signs all over the world point to the soon return of the Lord Jesus Christ.",4,Warnings From God?,1341705600,"07 8, 2012",2012,2341,"['interesting', 'study', 'very', 'pertinent', 'events', 'recent', 'history', 'United', 'States', 'Rabbi', 'Cahn', 'verse', 'Isaiah', '9:10', 'focus', 'analysis', 'events', 'country', 'starting', 'September', '11', '2001', 'destruction', 'two', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'towers', 'representing', 'first', 'shaking.The', 'documentary', 'two', 'parts', 'First', 'Shaking', 'Second', 'Shaking', 'two', 'DVD', 'first', 'Rabbi', 'Cahn', 'show', 'how', 'events', '9/11', 'followed', 'similar', 'pattern', 'Israel', 'experience', 'destruction', 'hands', 'Assyrians', 'parallels', 'are', 'too', 'close', 'appear', 'coincidental', 'Rabbi', 'Cahn', 'strong', 'arguments', 'events', 'are', 'warnings', 'God.The', 'information', 'provided', 'interesting', 'anyone', 'who', 'concerned', 'future', 'country', 'together', 'one', 'place', 'cross', 'section', 'information', 'events', 'occurred', 'conclusion', 'are', 'following', 'similar', 'path', 'nationally', 'are', 'being', 'given', 'warning', 'path', 'are', 'following', 'wrong', 'one.If', 'national', 'repentance', 'not', 'come', 'return', 'dependency', 'grace', 'God', 'judgment', 'will', 'surely', 'follow', 'increase', 'intensity.The', 'second', 'DVD', 'Second', 'Shaking', 'second', 'warning', 'God', 'being', 'financial', 'problems', 'have', 'emerged', 'events', 'September', '2008', 'including', 'bankruptcy', 'Lehman', 'Brothers', 'stock', 'market', 'crash', '2008.The', 'second', 'DVD', 'attempts', 'introduce', 'note', 'hope', 'when', 'Rabbi', 'Cahn', 'Christians', 'remember', 'God', 'promise', '2', 'Corinthians', '7:14', 'may', 'be', 'problem', 'there', 'many', 'believe', 'promise', 'was', 'only', 'Israel', 'not', 'church', 'God', 'gave', 'Israel', 'land', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'church', 'land', 'gave', 'church', 'heavenly', 'city', 'New', 'Jerusalem.There', 'real', 'doubt', 'United', 'States', 'unsustainable', 'path', 'continue', 'path', 'are', 'heading', 'down', 'path', 'destruction', 'nation', 'students', 'prophecy', 'have', 'observed', 'United', 'States', 'conspicuously', 'absent', 'Bible', 'prophecy', 'concerning', 'end', 'times.It', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'are', 'observing', 'reasons', 'play', 'out', 'real', 'life', 'doubtful', 'USA', 'will', 'be', 'restored', 'time', 'left', 'signs', 'world', 'point', 'soon', 'return', 'Lord', 'Jesus', 'Christ']",The Isaiah 9:10 Judgment: Is There an Ancient Mystery that Foretells America's Future?
