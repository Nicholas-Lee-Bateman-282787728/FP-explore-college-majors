1366723,A3TKDDLMCYJKT1,B003V5OO9E,"C. Chung ""Christopher Chung""","[5, 7]","""Assault Girls"" takes place sometime after a global nuclear war, but you'd never know it if you weren't told that.  In the down time of folks trying to rebuild human civilization, people find pleasure and escapism in a unified world-wide hyper-realistic virtual reality MMORPG that links directly into the brain.We are never shown the real world---only the game universe, and the film follows three women: Gray (.50 caliber Sniper), Lucifer (shapeshifting ""wereraven"" Magician), and Colonel (Warrior), as well as a single man: J&auml;ger (20mm Sniper), who all try to complete a level individually, but cannot because they lack the power to kill the end boss.  Eventually realizing they can't succeed on their own, they begrudgingly form a party to kill the boss to progress to the next stage.The ""plot"" (and I use that term loosely) blatantly and tiredly borrows from many similar shows, most notably the "".hack//Sign"" anime series, but the film is set in a post-apocalyptic sci-fi world instead of medieval fantasy, and it lacks the dynamism and polish of its various spiritual predecessors.  Instead, this film takes one single aspect of one single day, and tries to work a story around it.  But it doesn't work, because things are so tunnel-visioned and so myopic, that everything is reduced to near nothingness, and plot development is stalled and almost sacrificed altogether so we ""can"" exist in the same singular second the characters on screen exist in, instead of any type of plot progression past the immediate moment we are ""supposed"" to be locked into.  That might be an interesting experiment for a different type of existentialism film, but when we have guns, babes, dropships, mechs, and fighter bombers, it is wholly unacceptable because it wastes all of that.Under a more clever or skilled writer, this movie still could have been workable and cool, but the film also inherently fails because it has no clear direction.  In addition to wanting to be nothing but a snapshot of a Player Character's life in-fiction, it also wants to be too much out of the fiction in real life---i.e., sci-fi, fine art, social commentary, combat, philosophical, action, comedy, girls-with-guns, sexploitation, mecha, but it fails on all counts because it lacks the focus to carry each aspect out.The most glaring flaw, is the painfully boring down time in which the characters aimlessly wander the same exact 20 yards of film space on a hill in search of packs of badly CGIed ""Dune"" inspired giant sand worms (the only antagonists in the film, not including the main characters) that when killed, grant differing levels of experience points depending on the normal worms or the more powerful level boss.  The film is only about an hour and ten minutes long, but about 55 minutes of that IS the down time, and we are stuck literally watching someone walk back and forth.  When we do finally get some combat and action, it's very fast, and painfully CGI.A second flaw, is the absolutely atrocious selection of dialogue.  Most of the movie is in English, but towards the last quarter, everyone starts speaking Japanese, and it stays that way up until the very end.  I'm not sure if this was done to grab a larger viewership market by speaking English over Japanese, but it fails.  And here's the clincher: the English wasn't even dubbed over, it was the actual actors and actresses speaking it.  But with the exception of the narrator/computer voice and Lucifer, everyone had such strong accents, spoke so slowly, and were so unfamiliar with English language, it was very difficult to understand what is being said half the time, especially scenes in which everyone is talking while also wearing a rebreather mask that muffles what they say.  (Thankfully there's subtitles you can turn on.)  Lucifer on the other hand, had no speaking lines at all. Instead, she communicated (?) to the audience by dancing in a very odd, almost autistic way, complete with her own ""music box"" sounding theme song.  It was weird, but she filled the typical role of the cliched and expected quintessentially aloof and eccentric character found in the majority of J-pop shows or J-RPGs that the creators and fans seemingly can't get enough no matter how often it's done.This film was written and directed by Mamoru Oshii (director of the two theatrical ""Ghost in the Shell"" films), and this was billed as the first new live-action film he did since taking an 8-year hiatus from it.  He should have stayed away a little longer to hone his skills, because he's really rusty.  (That, or he spent so much time working with anime, that he can't make the leap back into flesh and blood film making.)  As stated, there is a distinct lack of any backgrounds except the top and side of a sandy hill the team decided to film at.  There is no real characterization except Lucifer's odd dancing.  Even the quality of cinematography is very plain and simple, and reinforces the ""boring aspect"" that the film radiates as a whole.  This felt like a bunch of cosplay friends getting together and making a low budget ad-libbed sci-fi movie on a Saturday afternoon on a hill overlooking a stone quarry, and then using a PC to add in the CGI effects later on.The only aspect I thought was well done, were the costumes.  They were pretty cool, and next to post-production CGI, that's where a good chunk of the money went.  The ending was also very funny, but you'd have to be familiar with online gaming antics to fully appreciate it.  That alone almost made up for the sheer snooze-fest of the rest of the film.  Almost, but not quite.  Too much was already holding the film back.If you have nothing better to do, or if your only options are watching paint dry, going to a wedding ceremony in a dry county for people you don't know, doing calculus homework, or watching this, go for this.  But if not, rent or buy at your own risk.  And if you do, be prepared for a 65+ minute unintended pseudo-nihilistic film that drags out and feels like three hours.",2,Marginally better than watching paint dry or doing math

1366724,A3OXHLG6DIBRW8,B003V5OO9E,"C. Hill ""CFH""","[0, 0]","The premise of ""Assault Girls"" is actually very cool and could have been very interesting. Unfortunately the execution of the movie is not up to modern standards and looks more like a well funded student film project rather than a professional, albeit low budget, movie release.No plot spoilers from me: There really isn't much in the way of a plot, four players in virtual gaming world need to set aside their solo tendencies and work together to complete a level. The setting is a very bleak landscape that has the gamers interacting with CG (computer generated) elements, including ""gimmicks"" (like user transports), weapons, and monsters. The CG ranges from just plain bad to very good, which also throws off the feel of the movie. There really isn't much in the way of acting to comment on as there is almost no character development and little real dialog (an odd mix of English and Japanese, with erratic use of subtitles). The name is also not quite accurate, perhaps they should have called it ""Mostly Action Girls"" since there are four human players, three females and one male. The action, when it happens, is actually pretty good and there is duel scene that is somewhat amusing (probably my favorite bit). I did like the costuming\wardrobe as it caught the feel of what gamers would choose.This would have made a great short, perhaps a half hour long, but it really has too much lag between action scenes to invest the time in to make worthwhile recommending it or seeing it again.CFH",2,Mildly Entertaining Bits,1316563200,"09 21, 2011",2011,1497,"['premise', 'Assault', 'Girls', 'actually', 'very', 'cool', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'interesting', 'Unfortunately', 'execution', 'movie', 'not', 'up', 'modern', 'standards', 'more', 'well', 'funded', 'student', 'film', 'project', 'rather', 'professional', 'albeit', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'release.No', 'plot', 'spoilers', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'way', 'plot', 'four', 'players', 'virtual', 'gaming', 'world', 'need', 'set', 'aside', 'solo', 'tendencies', 'work', 'together', 'complete', 'level', 'setting', 'very', 'bleak', 'landscape', 'gamers', 'interacting', 'CG', 'computer', 'generated', 'elements', 'including', 'gimmicks', 'user', 'transports', 'weapons', 'monsters', 'CG', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'very', 'good', 'also', 'feel', 'movie', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'way', 'acting', 'comment', 'almost', 'character', 'development', 'little', 'real', 'dialog', 'odd', 'mix', 'English', 'Japanese', 'erratic', 'use', 'subtitles', 'name', 'also', 'not', 'quite', 'accurate', 'perhaps', 'should', 'have', 'called', 'Mostly', 'Action', 'Girls', 'are', 'four', 'human', 'players', 'three', 'females', 'one', 'male', 'action', 'when', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'duel', 'scene', 'somewhat', 'amusing', 'probably', 'favorite', 'bit', 'did', 'costuming\\wardrobe', 'caught', 'feel', 'what', 'gamers', 'would', 'choose.This', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'great', 'short', 'perhaps', 'half', 'hour', 'long', 'really', 'too', 'much', 'lag', 'action', 'scenes', 'invest', 'time', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'recommending', 'seeing', 'again.CFH']",N/A

A long time in the opening of the movie, they will have no way of knowing anything that was said by the narrator. This is unsatisfactory.Now onto the actual movie. It was aweful.

ASSAULT GIRLS is horrid in its glacial pace and in its lack of content and just all around crap storytelling. The running time is 70 minutes but, really, the story, for what it had to offer, should've been boiled down to 15 minutes. Then it would've been a decent short. As it is, the film is broken up in chapters, with each chapter opening with some brain-hurting philosophical text caption. In the Why Should I Be The Only Sorry Bastard To Suffer Dept., here's one such bit of gobbelygook: ""Augury is not limited to fortune-telling. A god's will indicated through the results of augury conveys the meaning of that which will appear when the time has come. In other words, the characters used in augury will not end with augury. The characters seek augury to appear."" Even Confusius says, ""Huh?""I had an ominous feeling from jump, when the film kicked things off with a voiceover narration from hell that droned on and on for more than seven minutes. The voiceover guy probably had some pertinent high concept stuff to impart, but his jibber-jabber was so soul-killingly dreary I don't see how he can maintain anyone's attention. Anyway, the plot revolves around four characters armed with heavy artillery and navigating a bleak wasteland, the setting for the virtual game Avalon (f). Meisa Kuroki (the stunning ""Gray""), Hinako Saeki (""Colonel""), and Rinko Kikuchi (black-winged ""Lucifer"") play three of the characters and then there's also some dude named ""Jager,"" who is an ace marksman. Their targets are these giant sand worms, with each pixelated kill earning them high scores. Eventually all four players team up to take down the End Boss, which is the uber-sand worm, the holy of holies in terms of amassing points. Mostly, though, these folks wander the desert more than Moses.To say that there is good character development would be to say a lie. We don't learn squat about the gamers' real lives. There is minimal dialogue. One of the game's conceits is that participants must speak in English, except that the Japanese cast struggles mightily with English. Going by their delivery, there's a strong sense that they were merely phonetically sounding out their lines. The accents are so thick that without the provided English sub-titles, comprehension would've been nada.The ""Lucifer"" character comes off as interesting, initially. She plays around with her bowler hat, likes to dance, can shapeshift into a giant crow, demonstrates an impish persona. But it doesn't go anywhere. ""Colonel"" is a complete non-entity. ""Gray"" is the most beautiful and gets the most screen time, and she and ""Jager"" - with their replay fight sequences - arrive at my one favorite bit in the film. By the way, in a virtual one-on-one match, with various hi-tech weaponry at your disposal, would you, like Jager, opt for a baseball bat? Not that it matters. Gray delivers an outstanding smackdown... over and over and over.The film drowns in stark images and lingering camera shots and overwrought allegory (that statue and that snail, what's up with those?). I will say that the visual graphics are pretty decent, and that things finally do pick up in the last 15 minutes. Still, the best thing about this DVD is probably the trailer to IP MAN 2.""It is impossible to defeat Desert 22 flying solo.

They may lack in plot/story, acting or writing, but they're often at least enjoyable.Unfortunately, even going in with low standards I was very disappointed in Assault Girls.Being a big fan of Oshii - director of Ghost in the Shell (and Innocence), Avalon and a number of Anime titles - I really wanted to see this one despite the bad reviews. ""Maybe they just didn't get it?"" I though. After watching it, I realize I was in the wrong - the movie just was even tough to sit through (even at just 70 minutes!)I will say that it looked nice! If nothing else, it's a nice ""show off"" piece for Blu-Ray. Most shots are very sharp, detailed and impressive. The camera (or editing style) does seem to vary a bit as some shots are more desaturated, grainy and less detailed. It uses a lot of CGI which is ""above average"" level - not the horribly done types you see from time to time, but nothing hollywood-level.Audio is in English - there is a narrator who comes on from time to time (as someone mentioned - this is not subtitled). The girls speak english quite poorly (not even on the level that it may be a second language, more of a ""Say this"" and they repeat it. No tone to their dialog and it's sometimes hard to listen to -- if you've ever seenSukiyaki Western Django [Blu-ray] - it's a bit worse than that). I felt that would have been much better if done in their native language. Their dialog is subtitled (on by default) since they're a bit difficult to understand at times. Either way, their dialog is a bare minimum (the narrator does most of the talking).Video quality on the Blu-Ray is very good, audio isn't bad either. I'd say the video quality of the Blu-Ray would be the reason to watch this -- on DVD, it doesn't even have that benefit. Extras are also very minimal (trailers only - and seemingly just thrown on the disc as they're non-anamorphic (black bars on top/bottom/left/right).Overall, I really wanted to like this, but it just didn't do anything for me.

There was a 10 min intro with no action and just talk about the background story, which wasn't very interest and super boring. There things that I do like. I thought the main girl was very cute, and the other two girls were all right looking too. I really like their costumes they wearied. The graphics and special effects were pretty good. I like how the ending they wanted to screw over the guy player and that was very funny to watch.Even though there were things I did like about the movie, it couldn't stop it from getting a one star. This movie is just plain boring! It doesn't need to be a 1 hour movie and could had been a 30 min show or so. There were just nonsense of things shown and they were shown way too long as well. Do you really need to see each character just walking around thinking for 10 mins? They're not doing anything, but sitting, standing, or just walking. WTF?This movie also suffers for being a bilingual movie. They do talk in English and Japanese throughout the movie. I was reading the subs while they were speaking English. I was reading the subs while they were speaking Japanese. WTF? They should had just stuck with a pure Japanese because they know how to act while speaking Japanese and they know how to show their emotions about it. But, while they're try to act in English, they speak it with heavy accents and they don't know how to show their emotions on what they are truly saying.The thing about languages is, it is not what you say, but how you say it!When you say a bad word, you say it with feeling!!! Do you say it in a whisper? No, I bet you don't. But these actors did! In this movie, you don't see or hear the emotion when the actors were speaking English. They tend to just read off their lines and say it like it was a nice word. Doing so, does throw off the point of expressing the purpose of saying bad words or their meaning to them.On the other hand, when they were speaking in Japanese and saying those bad words, you can hear and feel their expressions on what they really mean. They didn't say it like a whisper and act all casual about it like in English. They said it with feeling!!! Why? Because they knew what the words really meant, and so, they acted it out.Only watch this movie if you just got nothing to watch, like I did.

Many of his films integrate Hollywood style sequences with his preferred style of pacing; which is typically very deliberate and slow. ""Assault Girls"" is no different, although he does shake things up a bit with the movie's structure. Those who have familiarized themselves with Oshii's work know that extended takes and long monologues are signature of his films. With ""Assault Girls"" he modulates these elements into chapters. The pre-chapter introduction opens up with a 10 minute monologue that provides a basis for the story, the creation of the game Avalon, as well as giving Oshii a chance to make statements about ""Pax Technologica"" in a globalized society. The voice over is a bit mumbled and subtitles, which are disabled at this point in the film, would have helped in penetrating the dense editorial text of this narrative. However, after rewinding a few times for clarification, I found the lengthy introduction to be thought-provoking and my favorite segment of the film.Following the introduction we get five chapters that take us through a sort of mini-plot that finds four competing characters having no choice but to put aside their quarrels in order to battle the big boss of the game Avalon, who otherwise could not be defeated alone. Over the course of the five chapters we get the three cinematic ""flavors"" that Oshii is known best for: a big-bang opening battle involving three sexy female gamers fighting off oversized sand worms; an entire chapter devoted to long silent takes of the gamers wandering the world of Avalon somewhat aimlessly; and finally, a very amusing chapter where two gamers settle a dispute in one-to-one combat (yes, Oshii does humor every now and then). Chapter 3, the infamous chapter that has our four gamers wandering the dessert of Avalon, feels like a skippable chapter (15 minutes in length), especially since the symbolism, that might make the sequence more meaningful, completely escapes me (there are numerous shots of a snail that, for all I know, could symbolize the slow nature of the sequence itself). But if you can get past Chapter 3 (or if you decide to just skip past it), you might decide that ""Assault Girls"" makes for an entertaining and even fun ""short-film"". Newcomers to Oshii's work might understandably be put-off or put to sleep.

It's a relatively short production that borders on art flick with minimalist dialogue that serves a practical purpose and a rather lengthy foreword provides exposition for the plot.  Quite a bit of the dialogue is provided by the ""help-voice"" which reminds the players of current missions and stat levels and I love how the gamers occasionally break into their native Japanese but are penalized for not using the Lingua Franca of the host server (I'm guessing).Basically four gamers are in a virtual MMO and trying very hard to level up for varied reasons and run a gamut of archetypes: the eccentric who prefers to stand around emoting, the completely serious person who treats what's essentially entertainment like it's life or death, the anti-social weirdo who loves trolling and getting his butt kicked in PVP, and the one who just enjoys playing for the fun of it and is most likely to be the social gamer. Of course all the female ""avatars"" are hot but I've never played an MMO where they weren't yet.  They are by nature lone players but are confronted by a no-win situation of facing an ""End Boss"" that none of them can take on their own, and hence the need to team up.Again, Assault Girls is probably only going to appeal to devout gamers which is why I assume it has such a low-rating on Amazon but I'm giving it 3 just because it really resonated with me, it's extraordinarily insightful and on the cutting edge of originality.",3,Only Gamers R Gonna Get This One,1356566400,"12 27, 2012",2012,1502,"[""'re"", 'MMORPG', 'lover', 'then', 'MUST', 'watch', 'little', 'gem', 'relatively', 'short', 'production', 'borders', 'art', 'flick', 'minimalist', 'dialogue', 'practical', 'purpose', 'rather', 'lengthy', 'foreword', 'exposition', 'plot', 'bit', 'dialogue', 'provided', 'help-voice', 'players', 'current', 'missions', 'stat', 'levels', 'love', 'how', 'gamers', 'occasionally', 'break', 'native', 'Japanese', 'are', 'penalized', 'not', 'using', 'Lingua', 'Franca', 'host', 'server', ""'m"", 'guessing', '.Basically', 'four', 'gamers', 'are', 'virtual', 'MMO', 'trying', 'very', 'hard', 'level', 'up', 'varied', 'reasons', 'run', 'gamut', 'archetypes', 'eccentric', 'who', 'stand', 'around', 'emoting', 'completely', 'serious', 'person', 'who', 'what', 'essentially', 'entertainment', 'life', 'death', 'anti-social', 'weirdo', 'who', 'trolling', 'getting', 'butt', 'kicked', 'PVP', 'one', 'who', 'just', 'playing', 'fun', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'social', 'gamer', 'course', 'female', 'avatars', 'are', 'hot', ""'ve"", 'never', 'played', 'MMO', 'where', 'were', ""n't"", 'yet', 'are', 'nature', 'lone', 'players', 'are', 'confronted', 'no-win', 'situation', 'facing', 'End', 'Boss', 'none', 'can', 'take', 'own', 'hence', 'need', 'team', 'up.Again', 'Assault', 'Girls', 'probably', 'only', 'going', 'appeal', 'devout', 'gamers', 'why', 'assume', 'such', 'low-rating', 'Amazon', ""'m"", 'giving', '3', 'just', 'really', 'resonated', 'extraordinarily', 'insightful', 'cutting', 'edge', 'originality']",N/A

If ever there was a time for shouting MINUS FIFTY DKP that was it.  Really it would be SWKP for Sand-Whale Kill Points.This movie is weak on all points except silly costumes.  It has great silly costumes.And it really is about the absurdity that you find inside an MMORPG.  The one girl just spends her time dancing.  There is ninja-looting, hardcore soloing, PvP, and sand whales.I feels like this movie was filmed in English, but it also feels like only one of the four speaking characters can actually speak English.  The talking can be quite painful.I originally described this movie as an empathetic DO NOT WATCH.  But I've softened my stance since then.
