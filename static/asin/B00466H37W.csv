1386365,A2B7SS9OH87HLR,B00466H37W,Boston Reader,"[0, 0]","Meet Detective Ed Green portrayed by Jesse L. Martin. A single overzealous cop who has a record for excessive force and a gambling addiction, Green will sometimes push the envelope a little further. A contrast from the devout Catholic family man that was Detective Curtis. The tenth year is full of memorable episodes. From cops dropping off a rich boy in Harlem to the prosecution of a Chilean politician for the murder of an American in Chile. One of the most memorable episodes is Gunshow, the season opener about the spree shooting of college students, most of whom were women. The topic of this episode is an ever so important discussion taking place throughout our country. Despite where you stand on gun control, when McCoy dumps that tray full of bullets on the table you feel for the family members of the victims that were killed. There is also a crossover with the spinoff, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit called ""Entitled Pt 2."" Part 1 is not included in this DVD set, unlike the Homicide crossovers. Instead you will have to purchase either a digital copy of the SVU episode or just buy season 1 of SVU on dvd(but that is another review). Also, Detectives Olivia Benson played by Mariska Hargitay and Eliot Stabler played by Chris Meloni guest star in the episode ""Fools For Love."" Season 10 also marks the last season in which Steven Hill portrays District Attorney Adam Schiff. At the time he was the longest running character and the last to leave from the first seasons. The tenth year shows that after a decade of being on air, Law & Order was still going strong. The revolving door for the shows cast continues to bring in new characters and pay farewell to old ones. Look at New York City in 1990 and look at it in the year 2000. A lot has changed since then including the evolving criminal mind continues and so the laws must change too. That is why we still need the police to investigate these crimes and the district attorneys to prosecute these offenders.

As a huge Law & Order fan, I can say that the quality of these episodes is top-notch.The product that NBC Universal/Universal Studios has put out though is another story.I'm willing to ignore the lack of an episode list because I can just as easily get that online. Missing that doesn't really detract from the quality.What I CANNOT and WILL NOT ignore is the absence of the crossover Law & Order SVU episode ""Entitled - Part 1."" The L&O; Part 2 episode is present, but nowhere to be found is the important Part 1, DESPITE THE BACK COVER SAYING IT IS FEATURED!When Season 9 came out, it took me a while to figure out where they had hidden the ""Homicide"" crossover episode. It was there, just very awkwardly placed. So before writing this review, I searched each of the five discs of Season 10 meticulously to see if I was missing something. I wasn't. It's nowhere to be found.So why isn't it there? Copyright issues aren't a problem considering that it's the same production company. Season 1 of SVU is available on DVD, so DVD rights and issues shouldn't exist.  I'm not as much of a fan of SVU, at least not enough to buy a season set just to get the one episode.Am I sorry I bought the set? No. At Amazon's $24.99 price, it's still a steal for the quality of the episodes.
