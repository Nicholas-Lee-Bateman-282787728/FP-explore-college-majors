1397498,A3JWVMLYSYQOSJ,B004DTQ22Y,"AlwaysLearning ""Happy2Be""","[4, 5]","While doing yoga with a DVD, I like to follow along and receive instructions on how to coordinate breathing with body alignment and Carly Porrello does that.  This yoga is not entirely seated in a chair but includes yoga positions using the chair for support.  The only slight criticism I have is that I would have liked more attention focused on coordinating the yoga with breath.  I thought the hand weights enhanced the program.  There are 2 students seated behind the instructor who demonstrate beginners and advanced levels. There is soft guitar music playing in the background that is not too intrusive.  The DVD has a home feel but the audio is perfect, picture clarity is excellent and Carly's voice is soothing.  Plus, the price is a real benefit.

The arm exercises ended in a dislocated shoulder. And the DVD has many standing exercises which can be impossible to do if someone does not have much lower body strength/control. I was expecting a full workout in a chair.",2,Arm exercises hurt my shoulders,1378339200,"09 5, 2013",2013,331,"['Everyone', 'own', 'level', 'ability', 'might', 'be', 'great', 'people', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'much', 'arm', 'ended', 'dislocated', 'shoulder', 'DVD', 'many', 'standing', 'exercises', 'can', 'be', 'impossible', 'do', 'someone', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'lower', 'body', 'strength/control', 'was', 'expecting', 'full', 'workout', 'chair']",N/A

Needs to be redone in a cleaner setting with a touch of accent pieces to draw the student to the various other persons working with the trainer.  The two assistants need to be brought out of the shadows and set up closer to the instructor so the individual watching can pick the person they want for focus on initially and then be able to readjust their view as they advance.,2,Still needs work,1391644800,"02 6, 2014",2014,419,"['was', 'first', 'chair', 'yoga', 'sent', 'back', 'be', 'redone', 'cleaner', 'setting', 'touch', 'accent', 'pieces', 'draw', 'student', 'various', 'other', 'persons', 'working', 'trainer', 'two', 'assistants', 'need', 'be', 'brought', 'shadows', 'set', 'up', 'closer', 'instructor', 'individual', 'watching', 'can', 'pick', 'person', 'want', 'focus', 'initially', 'then', 'be', 'able', 'readjust', 'view', 'advance']",N/A

1397503,A39YKEKCLUVL0L,B004DTQ22Y,Tina,"[13, 13]","This is becoming my favorite work-out DVD.  I bought this because I recently had knee surgery and wanted to do some form of either yoga or exercise without getting on the floor.When I first got the DVD, there was NO WAY I could anything standing up or bending any knee yet I was still quite satisfied with just the sitting portion of the DVD.  As my knee has healed, I've attempted the standing routines and LOVE the stretches for the back (downward dog, table). A week later, I did some of the lunges but only where the operated leg could stay straight.  I'm now switching legs but I don't do the entire routine because ... the routine is ... quite a lot!  It's pretty intense!Even the work-out without weights can be pretty intense in the arms.My favorite parts are the side stretches (while seated).  I can really feel a wonderful stretch all along the sides from the arms down to the hips.I haven't gone thru the whole DVD but what I've done is almost addictive!  As I get healthier and stronger, I hope to get thru the entire DVD -- even if I stay in the beginner's level.This DVD provides a good, intense, work-out at 3 different levels.  You should try it. Even if you take it real, real, easy at first you will still get a bit of an intense work-out.This is one of my favorite Amazon purchases.  I really like this DVD.  I hope you will, too!",5,Becoming Favorite Work-out DVD,1373673600,"07 13, 2013",2013,1350,"['becoming', 'favorite', 'work-out', 'DVD', 'bought', 'recently', 'had', 'knee', 'surgery', 'wanted', 'do', 'form', 'yoga', 'exercise', 'getting', 'floor.When', 'first', 'got', 'DVD', 'was', 'WAY', 'could', 'anything', 'standing', 'up', 'bending', 'knee', 'yet', 'was', 'still', 'quite', 'satisfied', 'just', 'sitting', 'portion', 'DVD', 'knee', 'healed', ""'ve"", 'attempted', 'standing', 'routines', 'LOVE', 'stretches', 'back', 'downward', 'dog', 'table', 'week', 'later', 'did', 'lunges', 'only', 'where', 'operated', 'leg', 'could', 'stay', 'straight', ""'m"", 'now', 'switching', 'legs', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'entire', 'routine', 'routine', 'quite', 'lot', 'pretty', 'intense', 'Even', 'work-out', 'weights', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'intense', 'arms.My', 'favorite', 'parts', 'are', 'side', 'stretches', 'seated', 'can', 'really', 'feel', 'wonderful', 'stretch', 'sides', 'arms', 'down', 'hips.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'gone', 'thru', 'whole', 'DVD', 'what', ""'ve"", 'done', 'almost', 'addictive', 'get', 'healthier', 'stronger', 'hope', 'get', 'thru', 'entire', 'DVD', 'even', 'stay', 'beginner', 'level.This', 'DVD', 'good', 'intense', 'work-out', '3', 'different', 'levels', 'should', 'try', 'Even', 'take', 'real', 'real', 'easy', 'first', 'will', 'still', 'get', 'bit', 'intense', 'work-out.This', 'one', 'favorite', 'Amazon', 'purchases', 'really', 'DVD', 'hope', 'will', 'too']",N/A
