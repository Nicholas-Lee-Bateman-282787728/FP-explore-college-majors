1255061,AVI9DU2RCLLB8,B00284EM2S,"F. Caldwell ""mixedpaint""","[6, 6]","I'm not entirely sure why Amazon isn't carrying the second season of Kyo Kara Maoh (or Kyou Kara Maou if you prefer). I remember seeing something a while back about a complaint claiming there was a problem with the Season 2 set. If that's the case I'm a little confused. My set seems to be just fine.Season 2 of KKM picks up right where the 1st season left off. Yuri and co. are still trying to get the 2nd of the ""forbidden boxes"" back to the Great Demon Kingdom (Shinmakoku) and Conrart's loyalties are still in question. The rest of the season deals with the search for the remaining 2 boxes. It also mixes in some side stories and a few historical episodes about Conrart's father, Julia, and the Great One (and the formation of the Great Demon Kingdom.) In the present, we also get to officially meet Bob, the Demon King (Maou) of Earth, and Shouri (Yuri's older brother). The season ends with a big bang, effectively wrapping up the story. Obviously season 2 was supposed to be the end but they went on to make a 3rd season afterall. Maybe someday that will get released here too. From what I've seen it's even better than Season 2.Storywise, Season 2 is pretty good with fewer fillers than the first season. No doubt that's due to the fact that it starts at the point and carries on from there. Season 2 also has some of my favorite episodes. I loved the inclusion of Shouri. Of course, you'll have to expect KKM to meander a bit. Each season has 39 episodes. It's hard to make all of them important but Season 2 certainly succeeds in making most of them memorable. The animation also improved a bit.The packaging itself is much like the reissue of Season 1. The box is pretty thin but it holds the discs together just fine. The discs are packed two to a case (except for the last disc which is alone) and include cover art and a few still shots along with the episode listings. The cases are the slim line type so expect the discs to pop free from time to time. The vocal cast is pretty much the same as the first season with the noteable addition of Katsuyuki Konishi (Loveless, Blood+, D.Gray-man, etc) as Shouri. I still remain a fan of the original Japanese with subtitles. The dub just doesn't do it for me. Besides Kyo Kara Maoh benefits from a great cast of Japanese voice actors. The English cast just can't compete.All together, Season 2 gets 4.5 stars from me. I might have liked a few more extras but the show itself is structurally sound. It also remains relatively friendly for younger viewers. Some of the middle episodes would need editing for the very young but Kyo Kara Maoh is much less violent than a lot of other shows despite the heavy use of sword fighting (which remains bloodless).",4,It's a mystery,1265500800,"02 7, 2010",2010,2712,"[""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'why', 'Amazon', ""n't"", 'carrying', 'second', 'season', 'Kyo', 'Kara', 'Maoh', 'Kyou', 'Kara', 'Maou', 'prefer', 'remember', 'seeing', 'something', 'while', 'back', 'complaint', 'claiming', 'was', 'problem', 'Season', '2', 'set', 'case', ""'m"", 'little', 'confused', 'set', 'be', 'just', 'fine.Season', '2', 'KKM', 'up', 'right', 'where', '1st', 'season', 'left', 'off', 'Yuri', 'co.', 'are', 'still', 'trying', 'get', '2nd', 'forbidden', 'boxes', 'back', 'Great', 'Demon', 'Kingdom', 'Shinmakoku', 'Conrart', 'loyalties', 'are', 'still', 'question', 'rest', 'season', 'deals', 'search', 'remaining', '2', 'boxes', 'also', 'mixes', 'side', 'stories', 'few', 'historical', 'episodes', 'Conrart', 'father', 'Julia', 'Great', 'One', 'formation', 'Great', 'Demon', 'Kingdom', 'present', 'also', 'get', 'officially', 'meet', 'Bob', 'Demon', 'King', 'Maou', 'Earth', 'Shouri', 'Yuri', 'older', 'brother', 'season', 'big', 'bang', 'effectively', 'wrapping', 'up', 'story', 'Obviously', 'season', '2', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'end', 'went', 'make', '3rd', 'season', 'afterall', 'Maybe', 'someday', 'will', 'get', 'released', 'here', 'too', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'even', 'better', 'Season', '2.Storywise', 'Season', '2', 'pretty', 'good', 'fewer', 'fillers', 'first', 'season', 'No', 'doubt', 'due', 'fact', 'point', 'Season', '2', 'also', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'loved', 'inclusion', 'Shouri', 'course', ""'ll"", 'have', 'expect', 'KKM', 'meander', 'bit', 'season', '39', 'episodes', 'hard', 'make', 'important', 'Season', '2', 'certainly', 'making', 'most', 'memorable', 'animation', 'also', 'improved', 'bit.The', 'packaging', 'much', 'reissue', 'Season', '1', 'box', 'pretty', 'thin', 'discs', 'together', 'just', 'fine', 'discs', 'are', 'packed', 'two', 'case', 'last', 'disc', 'alone', 'include', 'cover', 'art', 'few', 'still', 'shots', 'episode', 'listings', 'cases', 'are', 'slim', 'line', 'type', 'expect', 'discs', 'pop', 'free', 'time', 'time', 'vocal', 'cast', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'first', 'season', 'noteable', 'addition', 'Katsuyuki', 'Konishi', 'Loveless', 'Blood+', 'D.Gray-man', 'etc', 'Shouri', 'still', 'remain', 'fan', 'original', 'Japanese', 'subtitles', 'dub', 'just', ""n't"", 'do', 'Kyo', 'Kara', 'Maoh', 'benefits', 'great', 'cast', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'actors', 'English', 'cast', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compete.All', 'together', 'Season', '2', '4.5', 'stars', 'might', 'have', 'liked', 'few', 'more', 'extras', 'show', 'structurally', 'sound', 'also', 'relatively', 'friendly', 'younger', 'viewers', 'middle', 'episodes', 'would', 'need', 'editing', 'very', 'young', 'Kyo', 'Kara', 'Maoh', 'much', 'less', 'violent', 'lot', 'other', 'shows', 'heavy', 'use', 'sword', 'fighting', 'bloodless']",N/A
1255062,A182VTJIIEVM37,B00284EM2S,GintaxAlvissforever,"[0, 0]","...I'm serious. Season 3 isn't that good as season 2 given how serious the series got...and the fact that they introduced the worse character this series could have who goes on to try and destroy every pairing in this series because Yuuri is shallow in that season......Okay...ENOUGH WITH ME COMPLAINING AND BACK TO THE GREAT SEASON 2!Season 2 picks up right after season 1. Yuuri and co have retrieved 2 of the boxes needed to save both words and hiding it from King Belar in the human nation and trying to cope with the betrayal of Conrad. Thing are very serious as a result as its Yuuri's goal to secure the boxes before the evil King gets it and ironically, they get three boxes at the end of the Conrad arc.From there, they continue to develop the characters and search for the final box that is apparently not in the demon world and that the fourth box is actually in Yuuri's home world.But yes, this season has less fillers but reminds you of all the characters introduced in season 1 that have come back reformed or happy thanks to Yuuri's help in their particular arcs.Season 2 for me was my favorite season for many reasons. All the characters are developed way better in this season, there is more action and I love how Murata is promoted to one of the main characters after just being a bystander the majority of season 1. I think this season does the best though with developing Yuuri and Wolfram's relationship. People seem to forget that starting in season 1, Yuuri was very antagonistic toward Wolfram at the start of their ""engagement"". By this season, Wolfram is his best friend (and in season 3...the first few episodes have Yuuri outright say that Wolfram cannot break the engagement (because he totally has fallen for him at this point but he still won't say it)). I mean seriously, Yuuri cannot fight to save his life in season 1 and must rely on his split personality to do the dirty work for him. There was one particular episode in here, where Yuuri didn't even consider using his powers to save Wolfram and jumped into the fray to try and save him without anyone to back him up. Stupid but its the thought that counts and the old Yuuri would never have done that. And then another episode where he carries Wolfram bridal style and another where he fights someone for Wolfram's hand (that was also an accident but it just fuels the fire~) And the ending. Oh god...-ahem- Anyways, back to the character development. Yuuri isn't cowardly as he is in season 1. Wolfram becomes a caring individual but still tsundere who has at this point accepted and follows Yuuri's idealistic nature compared to his cynical nature of season 1. Conrad's character development is shown in his betrayal arc so I won't spoil anything. Gwendal has learned to appreciate his king (as in season 1, he disrespected him for being naive and not wanting to go to war with the humans) and is willing to make plans that will protect Yuuri. Gunther's personality seems to be more exaggerated in this season in all honestly but he's shown to be a competent fighter. Murata's personality is fleshed out in this season and makes him one of the more interesting characters (he's really messed up in the head I feel. I mean the novel implies that he's a victim of bullying...actually the anime shows that in the first episode but its actually very serious...but its not touched upon in this season given Murata doesn't really get an episode to himself like other characters. I mean, the three maids get an episode to themselves and that says something.)If the series ended here, this would have been the perfect ending...but with the continuation of season 3 and the OVA, the ending of the series ends up not having as much meaning as it had when it was originally aired.Overall, this series has comedy (less though given how serious this season is in comparison to season 1), action (more in this one), adventure, drama, more homoerotic subtext, and more prophecies and plot twists than the first season.
