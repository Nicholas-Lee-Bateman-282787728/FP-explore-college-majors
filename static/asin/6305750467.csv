475501,AYUFQY3XG4ZBR,6305750467,"Johnny Sideburns ""21st Century Renaissance Man""","[56, 56]","Before VH-1 started making documentaries of the making of ""classic albums"" (such as Jimi's ""Electric Ladyland"", Fleetwoods ""Rumours"", U2's ""The Unforgettable Fire"", etc.), this independent production in living black & white was shot of the Red Hot Chili Peppers as they became ""Funky Monks"" with producer extraordinaire Rick Rubin and retreated to a virtual monastery of an empty house in the hills above L.A. to record their greatest musical achievement ever, 1991's ""Blood Sugar Sex Magik"".>The video/DVD shows the painstaking detail with which the breakthrough album was recorded (of particular interest is the recording of the percussive effects heard in ""Breaking The Girl"") and in between recording time we see candid glimpses of the Peppers being...well, Peppers, being dads, talking about the band philosophy and what makes them who and what they are (and skimming through the personal ads in various sex mags).>And of course each Pepper's awesome musicianship is put on display (particularly John Frusciante, who I swear must be the second coming of Jimi Hendrix with his pre-addiction guitar technique, showcased in all of its glory here...the entire album was a breathtaking performance for a guitarist barely 20 years old at the time) as the recording sessions are filmed.>The songs appear only in snippets and in various different stages of production; you won't see any full-length performances (although a good bonus extra would have been the video for ""Give It Away"", especially since -incredibly- that video somehow was not included on the ""What Hits?"" DVD that was recently re-issued; more's the pity it isn't found here, either).  You'll recognize songs that weren't included with ""Blood Sugar..."" that were later released (""Soul To Squeeze"" being the the most recognizable) in addition to those that found their way onto the final version of the album.>But the personality of L.A. is every bit as much the star of this film as is the personalities of the Chili Peppers themselves.  The feel of the town is everywhere, from the record offices where the executives explain the concept behind the recording taking place in the fashion it did to the locations where Anthony is interviewed regarding the lyrics of ""Under The Bridge"" to the wrap party that is held at the house once the recording has been completed...the soul of Los Angeles (such as it is) and the symbiotic association it has with the band are factors that set this filmed ""making of"" documentary a step above all the others; there is much more than four guys in a studio and a producer in a booth...it is an encapsulation of a city and its most identifiable band, frozen in time forever.>In summation, don't watch this expecting a collection of videos or a live performance; watch it with an interest in a fantastic band and the creation of their finest work and feel the city breathing through them as it happens.",5,"The band is the land, the land is the band:",1044489600,"02 6, 2003",2003,2898,"['VH-1', 'started', 'making', 'documentaries', 'making', 'classic', 'albums', 'such', 'Jimi', 'Electric', 'Ladyland', 'Fleetwoods', 'Rumours', 'U2', 'Unforgettable', 'Fire', 'etc', 'independent', 'production', 'living', 'black', 'white', 'was', 'shot', 'Red', 'Hot', 'Chili', 'Peppers', 'became', 'Funky', 'Monks', 'producer', 'extraordinaire', 'Rick', 'Rubin', 'retreated', 'virtual', 'monastery', 'empty', 'house', 'hills', 'L.A.', 'record', 'greatest', 'musical', 'achievement', 'ever', '1991', 'Blood', 'Sugar', 'Sex', 'Magik', '>', 'video/DVD', 'painstaking', 'detail', 'breakthrough', 'album', 'was', 'recorded', 'particular', 'interest', 'recording', 'percussive', 'effects', 'heard', 'Breaking', 'Girl', 'recording', 'time', 'see', 'candid', 'glimpses', 'Peppers', 'being', 'well', 'Peppers', 'being', 'dads', 'talking', 'band', 'philosophy', 'what', 'who', 'what', 'are', 'skimming', 'personal', 'ads', 'various', 'sex', 'mags', '>', 'course', 'Pepper', 'awesome', 'musicianship', 'put', 'display', 'particularly', 'John', 'Frusciante', 'who', 'swear', 'must', 'be', 'second', 'coming', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'pre-addiction', 'guitar', 'technique', 'showcased', 'glory', 'here', 'entire', 'album', 'was', 'breathtaking', 'performance', 'guitarist', 'barely', '20', 'years', 'old', 'time', 'recording', 'sessions', 'are', 'filmed.', 'songs', 'appear', 'only', 'snippets', 'various', 'different', 'stages', 'production', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'full-length', 'performances', 'good', 'bonus', 'extra', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'video', 'Give', 'Away', 'especially', '-incredibly-', 'video', 'somehow', 'was', 'not', 'included', 'What', 'was', 'recently', 're-issued', 'more', 'pity', ""n't"", 'found', 'here', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'songs', 'were', ""n't"", 'included', 'Blood', 'Sugar', 'were', 'later', 'released', 'Soul', 'Squeeze', 'being', 'most', 'recognizable', 'addition', 'found', 'way', 'final', 'version', 'album.', '>', 'personality', 'L.A.', 'bit', 'much', 'star', 'film', 'personalities', 'Chili', 'Peppers', 'feel', 'town', 'everywhere', 'record', 'offices', 'where', 'executives', 'explain', 'concept', 'recording', 'taking', 'place', 'fashion', 'did', 'locations', 'where', 'Anthony', 'interviewed', 'regarding', 'lyrics', 'Bridge', 'wrap', 'party', 'held', 'house', 'recording', 'been', 'completed', 'soul', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'such', 'symbiotic', 'association', 'band', 'are', 'factors', 'set', 'filmed', 'making', 'documentary', 'step', 'others', 'much', 'more', 'four', 'guys', 'studio', 'producer', 'booth', 'encapsulation', 'city', 'most', 'identifiable', 'band', 'frozen', 'time', 'forever.', '>', 'summation', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'expecting', 'collection', 'videos', 'live', 'performance', 'watch', 'interest', 'fantastic', 'band', 'creation', 'finest', 'work', 'feel', 'city', 'breathing']",Red Hot Chili Peppers: Funky Monks

Hear the band talk about the creative process of the album from its inception, the writing, the recording and the production with Rick Rubin. For two months in the spring of 1991, the band set up home and a recording studio in a huge mediterranean style manner. Each band member had their own room, (apart from Chad who travelled to and from the house from his own home everyday). It is interesting for the viewer to re-live the whole process from beginning to end over the 60min documentary. You even feel a sense of accomplishment yourself once the film is over. Although it is filmed in black and white and the sound is a little poor, this is a must see for all chili peppers fans who no doubt, share a spiritual bond with the band and feel this period in the Red Hot Chili Peppers was there best ever.",4,They're Red Hot,1163721600,"11 17, 2006",2006,899,"['evolution', 'greatest', 'album', 'time', 'camera', 'Gavin', 'Bowden', 'Hear', 'band', 'talk', 'creative', 'process', 'album', 'inception', 'writing', 'recording', 'production', 'Rick', 'Rubin', 'two', 'months', 'spring', '1991', 'band', 'set', 'up', 'home', 'recording', 'studio', 'huge', 'mediterranean', 'style', 'manner', 'band', 'member', 'had', 'own', 'room', 'apart', 'Chad', 'who', 'travelled', 'house', 'own', 'home', 'everyday', 'interesting', 'viewer', 're-live', 'whole', 'process', 'beginning', 'end', '60min', 'documentary', 'even', 'feel', 'sense', 'accomplishment', 'once', 'film', 'over', 'filmed', 'black', 'white', 'sound', 'little', 'poor', 'must', 'see', 'chili', 'peppers', 'fans', 'who', 'doubt', 'share', 'spiritual', 'bond', 'band', 'feel', 'period', 'Red', 'Hot', 'Chili', 'Peppers', 'was', 'there', 'best', 'ever']",Red Hot Chili Peppers: Funky Monks
