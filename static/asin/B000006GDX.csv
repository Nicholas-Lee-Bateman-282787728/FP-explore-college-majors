It focuses on the prospective second marriage of Kay Villano (Sally Field), who three years prior had become a widow, when her then husband, Jolly (James Caan), met with an accidental death. Her fiance, Rupert Baines (Jeff Bridges), is a quiet, academic sort of man, the antithesis of her dead husband, who was a flamboyant philanderer and well known Broadway choreographer.When Kay decides to reopen their old home and have the wedding there, she gets an unepected visitor, the ghost of her long dead husband. Unfortunately, only she can see or hear him. She now has to choose whether to linger over the memories of the dead or embrace the idea of creating new memories with the living.Sally Fields is absolutely delightful as the tormented Kay. Her comedic timing is great, whether as the comedienne or as the comedic foil for James Caan. James Caan takes to the role of Jolly with unsurprising ease. Jeff Bridges is, unfortunately, somewhat wooden and stiff in his role. He could have been better. The rest of the supporting cast, which includes Claire Bloom and Mildred Natwick, however, is excellent.This film, which brings to mind the likes of Noel Coward, is a funny, well acted film. It is a light, frothy, romantic comedy and has no pretensions of being anything more.

Back in the day, it was in heavy rotation on cable movie channels and I watched it seemingly a zillion times. Finally, I got on IMDB and found the name.  How great that Amazon offered it for sale and so cheap too.  It is one of James Caan's more charming offerings and Jeff Bridges takes what could have been a rather silly character and turns him into a droll, wisecracking kind of guy.  Sally Field is, well, Sally Field, but this character fits her to a ""t.""  The plot about a dead spouse whose spirit will not leave is an oft-used vehicle for merriment and mayhem (okay, I am being droll here).  What sets this film apart is a non-sacchrine performance by James Caan as a ""song and dance man"" who left Sally Field too early.  Some of the jokes are a little lame, but the principals do a great job and of course, we have the fantastic Robert Mulligan directing.  Also, Claire Trevor does a wonderful turn as Sally's character's mother.

However, it's like two movies. The first 45 minutes or hour are long and boring, repeating issues (over and over again) between characters who aren't at all likable and who make you wonder why you're supposed to care about them. Ironically, I found myself caring very much about the character played by Jeff Bridges, who inexplicably is made out to be a monster by everyone else.Finally the film picks up. When it does, it's very funny in spots. However, one is still left wondering why the heck Bridges would want to marry the character of Sally Fields, whose stupidity and flightiness are overshadowed only by the self-centeredness of James Caan, who plays her two-timing (dead) husband. If you have time to waste, rent it, with a ready finger for the fast-forward button. Otherwise, there are many films that are a better choice.

The scene in the bedroom is so funny...""They're my Aunt Edna's!"" is the line we can say anytime, anywhere and she and I will both giggle.  It's just a great movie to watch on a cold winter day...or a rainy day...or ANY day that you want to watch a movie that will make you laugh...and maybe even cry! Great acting by everyone, including the dog, Shakespeare.

I think I may have taped it on VCR but long gone!Not only is the story a sweet love story, she really finds out what a ""cad"" her dead husband was but I think James C. really as a ghost found out how much he loved her!!! Too little too late!!! But back to how I started the sentence, not only is it a sweet love story but I just LOVED the brownstone that they use to live in but has been closed up and they, Sally and Jeff redo it!!!!

I remembered laughing at Jeff Bridges so hard in this movie.  Seriously, he is amazing in the film, as is everyone actually.  After hearing Bridges in an interview on TV recently, and he made a comment about this film, I quickly pulled Kiss Me Goodbye out again and watched it.  It is so wonderfully funny - hysterically funny - and a must see.You really need to see it with someone because it needs to be enjoyed with someone you love.I watched it twice the same night and ordered a copy for our son and his wife.  Just know it is worth owning and you will never grow tired of the story.  Everything, by the way, is as modern today as it was when it first came out for viewing.  No cars are used and nothing is dated.  Hair, clothing, everything is current.  Difficult to do that in any film but this takes no adjustment in years to watch it - not dated at all.  It should be a classic.Buy it and enjoy it; it is not costly and will last forever.",5,I Love This Movie!,1314057600,"08 23, 2011",2011,1074,"['had', 'seen', 'Kiss', 'Me', 'Goodbye', 'own', 'husband', 'left', 'other', 'wonderful', 'place', 'called', 'Heaven', 'loved', 'film', 'remembered', 'laughing', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'so', 'hard', 'movie', 'Seriously', 'amazing', 'film', 'everyone', 'actually', 'hearing', 'Bridges', 'interview', 'TV', 'recently', 'made', 'comment', 'film', 'quickly', 'pulled', 'Kiss', 'Me', 'Goodbye', 'out', 'again', 'watched', 'so', 'wonderfully', 'funny', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'must', 'see.You', 'really', 'need', 'see', 'someone', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'someone', 'love.I', 'watched', 'twice', 'same', 'night', 'ordered', 'copy', 'son', 'wife', 'Just', 'know', 'worth', 'owning', 'will', 'never', 'grow', 'tired', 'story', 'Everything', 'way', 'modern', 'today', 'was', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'viewing', 'cars', 'are', 'used', 'nothing', 'dated', 'Hair', 'clothing', 'everything', 'current', 'Difficult', 'do', 'film', 'adjustment', 'years', 'watch', 'not', 'dated', 'should', 'be', 'classic.Buy', 'enjoy', 'not', 'costly', 'will', 'last', 'forever']",Kiss Me Goodbye VHS

494108,A1XX1KKXH9W7I7,B000006GDX,wolfgang731,"[2, 3]","This film is hardly a comedic masterpiece, however, it proved a very fine vehicle for all three principals, especially Sally Field who, in my opinion, delivers a quirky and hopelessly likeable performance as the woman torn between the ghost of her charming, albeit, womanizing and egotistical dead husband and the bland, academic all around drip of a fianc&eacute;, James Caan and Jeff Bridges, respectively.  There's none of that hammy grandstanding that has marred her performance in her later work, such as that overwrought cemetery scene in Steel Magnolias.  Here she seems to be not only comfortable in the character's skin and predicament but appears to really be enjoying herself in the process, as does everyone else.  The film has this unpretentious vibe that works totally in its favor and everyone seems to be relaxed and in the mood to deliver the goods.  There are some extremely funny set pieces in this film and I've always considered it a much underrated little charmer, despite some silly scenes and less than inspired ideas.",4,"A charmer, in spite of itself.",1178150400,"05 3, 2007",2007,1042,"['film', 'hardly', 'comedic', 'masterpiece', 'however', 'proved', 'very', 'fine', 'vehicle', 'three', 'principals', 'especially', 'Sally', 'Field', 'who', 'opinion', 'quirky', 'hopelessly', 'likeable', 'performance', 'woman', 'ghost', 'charming', 'albeit', 'womanizing', 'egotistical', 'dead', 'husband', 'bland', 'academic', 'drip', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'James', 'Caan', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'respectively', 'none', 'hammy', 'grandstanding', 'marred', 'performance', 'later', 'work', 'such', 'overwrought', 'cemetery', 'scene', 'Steel', 'Magnolias', 'Here', 'be', 'not', 'only', 'comfortable', 'character', 'skin', 'predicament', 'really', 'be', 'enjoying', 'process', 'everyone', 'else', 'film', 'unpretentious', 'vibe', 'totally', 'favor', 'everyone', 'be', 'relaxed', 'mood', 'deliver', 'goods', 'are', 'extremely', 'funny', 'set', 'pieces', 'film', ""'ve"", 'always', 'considered', 'much', 'underrated', 'little', 'charmer', 'silly', 'scenes', 'less', 'inspired', 'ideas']",Kiss Me Goodbye VHS
