It had thatMaverick: The Complete First Seasontype feel to it.Now in the 1970's , the idea of DVDs and Blue ray players and watching whole series at home was a concept unheard of. These TV shows were not thought of for hi-dep TV in the 1970's, when this show original aired. However these masters recordings seem to be the best uncut versions of these shows. Better than the cut up versions that are run on cable television todayThe pilot (one disk one of season one) has a special addition to it. It has an audio commentary track with show producer/creator Glen Larson. It will also give you insights on this show that you heard before. I only wish that Davis or Murphy, who are still alive, or a few of the guest cast could have done a commentary track on an episode. Alas that did not happenBen Murphy (Jones) was in the whole show's run. Pete Duel started as Smith, until his  untimely death in the middle of show's second season. Instead of canceling this western comedy, Duek was replaced by actor Roger (Dark Shadows) Davis, who did the show's original openning narration credits. With Murphy and Davis in the lead, they tried to make the show seamless after Duel's death. Think Bewitched and the multiple Darrens.The guest stars were actors from the universal stable of 1970's actors including Susan St James, Sally Fields, William Ruseel, James Drury and many more. Familar faces make this show filled with great acting talent.Lets be honest, This was a fluffy popcorn show. It was a show for western adventure, fun and laughs. You will enjoy this show is you just sit back and watchIt is good to watch a show that you do not have follow week to week. You can watch any episode and do not have to watch a multiple story arc, as you do todayIt is worth just watching for the fun.Bennet PomerantzAUDIOWORLD",5,1970's western comedy,1361318400,"02 20, 2013",2013,2193,"['plot', 'story', 'seem', 'simple', 'Former', 'Devil', 'Hole', 'Gang', 'leaders', 'Kid', 'Curry', 'Hannibal', 'Heyes', 'alias', 'Joshua', 'Smith', 'Thaddeus', 'Jones', 'pair', 'successful', 'popular', 'outlaws', 'trying', 'go', 'straight', 'lifetime', 'mostly', 'non-violent', 'banditry.This', 'Butch', 'Cassidy', 'clone', 'was', 'ABC', 'movie', 'week', 'Night', 'Stalker', 'was', 'was', 'cute', 'western', 'plot..which', 'became', 'series', 'had', 'thatMaverick', 'Complete', 'First', 'Seasontype', 'feel', 'it.Now', '1970', 'idea', 'DVDs', 'Blue', 'ray', 'players', 'watching', 'whole', 'series', 'home', 'was', 'concept', 'unheard', 'TV', 'shows', 'were', 'not', 'thought', 'hi-dep', 'TV', '1970', 'when', 'show', 'original', 'aired', 'However', 'masters', 'recordings', 'seem', 'be', 'best', 'uncut', 'versions', 'shows', 'Better', 'cut', 'up', 'versions', 'are', 'run', 'cable', 'television', 'todayThe', 'pilot', 'one', 'disk', 'one', 'season', 'one', 'special', 'addition', 'audio', 'commentary', 'track', 'show', 'producer/creator', 'Glen', 'Larson', 'will', 'also', 'give', 'insights', 'show', 'heard', 'only', 'wish', 'Davis', 'Murphy', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'alive', 'few', 'guest', 'cast', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'commentary', 'track', 'episode', 'did', 'not', 'happenBen', 'Murphy', 'Jones', 'was', 'whole', 'show', 'run', 'Pete', 'Duel', 'started', 'Smith', 'untimely', 'death', 'middle', 'show', 'second', 'season', 'Instead', 'canceling', 'western', 'comedy', 'Duek', 'was', 'replaced', 'actor', 'Roger', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'Davis', 'who', 'did', 'show', 'original', 'openning', 'narration', 'credits', 'Murphy', 'Davis', 'lead', 'tried', 'make', 'show', 'seamless', 'Duel', 'death', 'Think', 'Bewitched', 'multiple', 'Darrens.The', 'guest', 'stars', 'were', 'actors', 'universal', 'stable', '1970', 'actors', 'including', 'Susan', 'St', 'James', 'Sally', 'Fields', 'William', 'Ruseel', 'James', 'Drury', 'many', 'more', 'Familar', 'make', 'show', 'filled', 'great', 'acting', 'talent.Lets', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'fluffy', 'popcorn', 'show', 'was', 'show', 'western', 'adventure', 'fun', 'will', 'enjoy', 'show', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'watchIt', 'good', 'watch', 'show', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'follow', 'week', 'week', 'can', 'watch', 'episode', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'watch', 'multiple', 'story', 'arc', 'do', 'todayIt', 'worth', 'just', 'watching', 'fun.Bennet', 'PomerantzAUDIOWORLD']",N/A

1379788,A2B2J12WFHBUC2,B004164P96,Hyzenthlay,"[1, 2]","I fell in love with the tragic Pete Duel all over again.  The stories hold up; it's a classic Western -- a bit of &#34;Maverick,&#34; a bit of &#34;Butch Cassidy,&#34; and a lot of great chemistry between the lead actors.  As good as the chemistry between Newman and Redford in &#34;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.&#34;Duel didn't believe it when Will Geer told him he could be as big a star as Newman, but he was right.  There wasn't a dang thing that Newman had in &#34;Butch&#34; that Duel didn't have in this show.  They could have killed off Ben Murphy and the show could have continued.  But without Pete, it lost its heart.For an interesting story, look into how Pete died -- especially the lies his girlfriend told to the police afterward.  Goes to show depression, alcohol and guns don't mix.  The guy who gave him the gun should wake up screaming every night.  But that's just my opinion.  Everyone on the set knew he drank and drank hard.  Oh, well.

I've watched the first 5 episodes and find the video quality to be horrible. Most DVDs I watch on my upconverting blu-ray player look pretty good, or at least acceptable. These episodes look grainy. It looks like they are doing a weird frame rate. When people talk, there lips appear to be blurring. Almost like a ghosting effect. I noticed the same thing on a dark train sequence where the wood appeared to be blurring (Episode 5, The girl in Boxcar #3). I've never had an issue with anything else, so I completely believe its the DVD mastering. I notice the mps is low compared to other full frame DVDs of series I own. That said, this is a great series which I used to watch years ago and always enjoyed. 5 stars for great show, 1 star for the video quality.",3,video quality awful,1297641600,"02 14, 2011",2011,868,"[""'m"", 'little', 'surprised', 'see', 'other', 'people', 'have', 'rated', 'video', 'quality', 'complete', 'series', 'be', 'good', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'first', '5', 'episodes', 'find', 'video', 'quality', 'be', 'horrible', 'Most', 'DVDs', 'watch', 'upconverting', 'blu-ray', 'player', 'look', 'pretty', 'good', 'least', 'acceptable', 'episodes', 'look', 'grainy', 'are', 'doing', 'weird', 'frame', 'rate', 'When', 'people', 'talk', 'appear', 'be', 'blurring', 'Almost', 'ghosting', 'effect', 'noticed', 'same', 'thing', 'dark', 'train', 'sequence', 'where', 'wood', 'appeared', 'be', 'blurring', 'Episode', '5', 'girl', 'Boxcar', '3', ""'ve"", 'never', 'had', 'issue', 'anything', 'else', 'completely', 'believe', 'DVD', 'mastering', 'notice', 'mps', 'low', 'compared', 'other', 'full', 'frame', 'DVDs', 'series', 'own', 'said', 'great', 'series', 'used', 'watch', 'years', 'ago', 'always', 'enjoyed', '5', 'stars', 'great', 'show', '1', 'star', 'video', 'quality']",N/A
