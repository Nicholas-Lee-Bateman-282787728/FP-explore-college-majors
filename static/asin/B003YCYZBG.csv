While some of the footage was new, much of it was stuff I had seen on the history channel and the victory at sea series. Some of the information was informative like the French invasion of Germany after the declaration of war and the fact that Hitler did not pursue the English troops evacuating at Dunkirk although Stukas did sink some of the evacuation craft. Some of the footage fell short of telling the whole story, like the part about the bombing of Monte Cassino in Italy. Much of the new footage focused on the eastern front. While the development of the Soviet air force played a large part in the battle, it was overlooked in this dvd. The pacific war footage showed the battle for Saipan and said that it was the place where B-29s took off to attack Japan, and they covered the atomic bomb drops on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, although those attacks were launched from Tinian and not Saipan.

1376161,A3GTK03C19V47W,B003YCYZBG,"James Bowen ""historian""","[5, 5]","This French production purports to encapsulate World War II in a set of three discs of 280 minutes duration in total but there is a heavy emphasis on the European and Russian theatres of World War II, and in particular, the French role in the defeat of Nazi Germany. The crucial battles in the North African Campaign and the entirely separate and massive Pacific War receive relatively brief coverage despite the fact that German victory in North Africa would have given them control of the Suez Canal and the vital Middle East oilfields, and Japanese victory in the Pacific in 1942 would have threatened Hawaii and Australia and seriously transformed the strategic situation in Europe and Russia. If the United States Navy had been defeated at Midway, local political imperatives would have forced President Roosevelt to defend Hawaii against planned Japanese occupation. This situation would almost certainly have delayed D-Day by at least a year, and possibly seen a Russian army reach the English Channel.No mention is made of the fact that the Chinese were holding down at least thirty Japanese divisions throughout the Pacific War. The Chinese earned their place at the signing of the Japanese surrender. The Americans and Australians did all of the heavy lifting in the Pacific War, and earned their places at the Japanese surrender but I fail to understand why the French were at the signing in Tokyo Bay when they collaborated with the Japanese in Indo-China and contributed no significant military support to the defeat of Japan.Being a French production, we should not be surprised that far more time is spent on the Battle for France than on the Battle of Britain or the Battle of the Atlantic despite the fact that the two latter battles were arguably among the five most important battles of World War II. In coverage of the North African Campaign, no mention is made of the lengthy and vital Allied defence of the port of Tobruk over twelve months which was a constant thorn in Rommel's side and forced him to land his reinforcements and supplies at Tripoli, including fresh supplies of tanks, and move them across 1,200 kilometres (750 miles) of exposed desert when his front line neared the border with Egypt. While Tobruk remained in Allied hands, Rommel's supply lines were constantly stretched to breaking point every time he approached the border with Egypt. In the Pacific War, the Battle of the Coral Sea (May, 1942) is completely ignored despite it being Japan's first strategic defeat and the fact that it laid the foundation for the massive defeat of the Japanese navy at the Battle of Midway (June, 1942). The Japanese defeats in the lengthy and bloody Papuan and Guadalcanal Campaigns (both early 1943) forced Japan on the defensive for the rest of the Pacific War but neither campaign rates a significant mention in this French production.My advice to those interested in balanced coverage of World War II is to choose the magnificentThe World at War (30th Anniversary Edition), and for much better coverage of the Pacific War look elsewhere.I have watched many hundreds of hours of archived World War II film, and feel that the researchers have done a remarkable job in unearthing film that I have never seen before. Much of the archive war action footage of the European and Russian theatres appears to have come from  WW II German and Russian military and propaganda sources, Wehrmacht soldiers' personal filming, and other private sources that include filming of intensely personal scenes of civilian suffering.Considerable effort has gone into restoring the archive film covering the European and Russian theatres by removing scratches and blotches, and the rendition in colour is quite extraordinary. The production has been colorised in such a way that the injected colour appears perfectly natural and never garish. The only exception to colourising is in the scenes depicting Nazi and Japanese brutality towards their victims. These scenes are depicted in the original stark black and white.Less care has gone into coverage of the Pacific war and restoration of archive film. The coverage of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in this film has errors, such as promoting air attack leader Mitsuo Fuchida from commander to captain and placing him on the carrier Zuikaku instead of the flagship Akagi. The archive film of the Pacific War is mostly very poor quality by comparison with archive footage from Europe and Russia which is mostly very good. This can probably be explained by the heavy emphasis on the European and Russian theatres. Of Hirohito as Japan's war leader in the Pacific War, this production makes the absurd claim with regard to Emperor Hirohito ""Did the emperor know (about the atrocities committed in China)... he reigns but does not govern"". The researchers for this French production have not done their Pacific War homework adequately. Hirohito was not a token leader of his military but a ""hands-on"" commander in chief who approved every major Japanese military action, including all of Japan's military aggression. His aides-de-camp were active on every front.The French producers make the naive assertion: ""Along with imperialism, the underlying cause of World War II is racism"". The underlying cause of World War II was not racism but greed for the territory and resources of other countries. Nazi and Japanese aggression was fired by extreme militarism in both Germany and Japan. Racism was employed by both the Nazis and Japanese to justify their military aggression to their own people. The Nazis despised Jews and murdered six million of them. The Japanese despised the Chinese and murdered between five and ten million civilians and prisoners of war by horrifying methods including burying them alive and burning them alive in mass

And while not suitable for the faint hearted, this is the reality of war, and a documentary is supposed to bring you as close to reality as possible.3) While no WW2 documentary could be truly balanced because winners write history, this is as close to balance and objectivity as I've seen them.
