If Cora and Mr. Brown wasn't in this play it would be terrible.  I didn't like D'Atra Hick character Nurse Trudy. D'Atra Hicks is over acting she made the play unbearable at times. I didn't care for her acting. She is too much. Some people are born funny and some people try to act funny. She is trying to act funny and it doesn't work. She was a BIG distracting. I think if Perry got someone else to play nurse Trudy it would have been alot better than what it was. As usual TP covers some good topics that we all need to think about. I have to give credit to Ms. Latrice Pace ( Nurse Nancy) she did a good job. She help save this play too. I hope to see her in more plays she is a talented singer as well as an actress. TP knows  how to put eye candy in his plays so that was a good thing as well. Overall it was ok. TP keep up the good work.

A high school basketball player does not go from getting shot to signing with the NBA straight from the hospital.

Greene ""VIwestindian""","[5, 5]","I felt obligated to write a good review about this play since I am very much a Tyler Perry fan but I truly just did not like this play. If it was really about health disparities, I think he should have emphasized it more. I mean, he made me happy by putting Christian Keyes, Ryan Gentles and svelte Terrell Carter in the play but other than them and of course, David and Tamela Mann, everything else fell short. I think I mostly did not like D'Atra Hicks' performance because it was just too much. What man who got a medical degree from Yale would be interested in a woman so CRAZY! And she was so demure in Family Reunion that I was shocked this was the same woman. Her character was just tooo crazy. The plot seemed rushed and points were not focused upon long enough to make them stick.Don't get me wrong, I absolutely LOVED ""Why did I get Married,"" the movie. It is probably Tyler's best work but when he brings movies out too quickly after the other, he falters. For instance, compare Family Reunion and Daddy's Little Girls. Also, Why Did I Get Married and Meet the Browns (he really should not have cast Rick Fox in that movie at all--terrible move). I hope he realizes this; when his movies come out too quickly after another, one pales in comparison and quality suffers. I truly hope he realizes this and takes time to write and produce his plays and movies so that the Tyler Perry can remain above the standard.",2,I really did not like it....,1211932800,"05 28, 2008",2008,1421,"['felt', 'obligated', 'write', 'good', 'review', 'play', 'am', 'very', 'much', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'fan', 'truly', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'play', 'was', 'really', 'health', 'disparities', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'emphasized', 'more', 'mean', 'made', 'happy', 'putting', 'Christian', 'Keyes', 'Ryan', 'Gentles', 'svelte', 'Terrell', 'Carter', 'play', 'other', 'course', 'David', 'Tamela', 'Mann', 'everything', 'else', 'fell', 'short', 'think', 'mostly', 'did', 'not', ""D'Atra"", 'Hicks', 'performance', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'What', 'man', 'who', 'got', 'medical', 'degree', 'Yale', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'woman', 'so', 'CRAZY', 'was', 'so', 'demure', 'Family', 'Reunion', 'was', 'shocked', 'was', 'same', 'woman', 'character', 'was', 'just', 'tooo', 'crazy', 'plot', 'seemed', 'rushed', 'points', 'were', 'not', 'focused', 'long', 'enough', 'make', 'stick.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'absolutely', 'LOVED', 'Why', 'did', 'get', 'Married', 'movie', 'probably', 'Tyler', 'best', 'work', 'when', 'movies', 'out', 'too', 'quickly', 'other', 'instance', 'compare', 'Family', 'Reunion', 'Daddy', 'Little', 'Girls', 'Also', 'Why', 'Did', 'Get', 'Married', 'Meet', 'Browns', 'really', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'cast', 'Rick', 'Fox', 'movie', 'terrible', 'move', 'hope', 'when', 'movies', 'come', 'out', 'too', 'quickly', 'one', 'pales', 'comparison', 'quality', 'suffers', 'truly', 'hope', 'time', 'write', 'produce', 'plays', 'movies', 'so', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'can', 'remain', 'standard']",Tyler Perry's What's Done in the Dark... - The Play Collection
1128261,A2C5VLIJMDPWHI,B0010YVCAW,"Shamontiel L. Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[6, 8]","I bought this play after seeing the previews on ""Why Did I Get Married?"" movie, and honestly, I wanted the movie just to grin at Christian Keyes and Ryan Gentles again. To this day, my friends and family (including myself) still speculate on who's finer between the two. Thumbs up to two very gorgeous men!Pros: Mr. Brown made this play! Every single time he came out with those terrible outfits on, I covered my eyes and cracked up. The best part of the whole play was when he pulled the scene from Mortal Kombat and pulled out a heart but him acting like Michael Jackson was a close second. Now THAT was funny! The doctor's visits and ""Cora got a boyfriend"" was cute too. I thought Christian Keyes' character had a point about showing receipts for child support--that's fair. I dug the story about the Lovetts, and the issues with STDs because it's so relevant, and I hope people started getting tested, especially considering the two characters were supposed to be married. Chantell Christopher is always entertaining at whatever role she plays. Last but not least, I LOVED the scene of the doctor rubbing the kiss on his lips. Tyler Perry definitely knows how to pick the guys in the film--eye candy all around, but if I rewatch this movie, I'm fast-forwarding to all of Mr. Brown's scenes first. Everybody who buys this DVD, please watch ""Mr. Brown Introduces the Cast"" and ""Mr. Brown Goes Shopping."" I was too amazed at his clothes to even laugh up until he talked about ""Golden Girls."" Hilarious! If I could rate this movie on Mr. Brown alone, it'd be five stars. However...Cons: Some of the jokes in this play are recycled, such as the one about ""going Charlotte, North Carolina."" That reminded me of ""Madea Goes to Jail"" when Madea said she had to ""get back to Conyers [GA] where [I] knew somebody"" and telling the one guy he looks like he's from Augusta. The location jokes were cool the first round, but it's time to let that die now.There was also a comment that the single mother made about $25 for her ex-fling to spend time with their son. This was similar to a scene in ""Meet the Browns,"" as well as the Dad coming back when the son blew up. Speaking of the son, he was about my age, so I was completely confused when his mother was talking to him like he was in high school. They couldn't find anybody who looked like he was in high school? The guy was cute, but I didn't buy the high school age he was going for.The songs were excellent, and I enjoyed all of the singers' voices, but as soon as they started doing runs, it was driving me nuts. I hate it when people oversing a song. Patti LaBelle fans love this kind of stuff, but I don't think it's necessary to sing the same note for 20 minutes. However, BEFORE the runs, I'd give all the songs a 10!That whole speech about what you can't get receipts for as a mother was a bunch of nonsense because all of that would be done regardless of child support. I wish she would've named something that involved money (ex. school funds, food, shelter, transportation to and from school, babysitter, diapers, clothes, shoes, college savings, allowance).The one nurse who kept making passes at the doctor was doing a whole lot of overacting and making goofy noises. After the first couple of times, it was extremely annoying, complete overkill, and she needs to learn comedic timing. She could've been so funny if she'd have calmed down just a little. I'm surprised Tyler Perry didn't critique that because he has great timing with Madea's character and Madea's brother Joe.One last thing:  Why would someone keep calling their father ""Mr. Brown""?",2,I'm a sagittarius...I mean a vegetarian!,1212451200,"06 3, 2008",2008,3608,"['bought', 'play', 'seeing', 'previews', 'Why', 'Did', 'Get', 'Married', 'movie', 'honestly', 'wanted', 'movie', 'just', 'grin', 'Christian', 'Keyes', 'Ryan', 'Gentles', 'again', 'day', 'friends', 'family', 'including', 'still', 'speculate', 'who', 'finer', 'two', 'Thumbs', 'up', 'two', 'very', 'gorgeous', 'men', 'Pros', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'made', 'play', 'single', 'time', 'came', 'out', 'terrible', 'outfits', 'covered', 'eyes', 'cracked', 'up', 'best', 'part', 'whole', 'play', 'was', 'when', 'pulled', 'scene', 'Mortal', 'Kombat', 'pulled', 'out', 'heart', 'acting', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'was', 'close', 'second', 'Now', 'was', 'funny', 'doctor', 'visits', 'Cora', 'got', 'boyfriend', 'was', 'cute', 'too', 'thought', 'Christian', 'Keyes', 'character', 'had', 'point', 'showing', 'receipts', 'child', 'support', 'fair', 'dug', 'story', 'Lovetts', 'issues', 'STDs', 'so', 'relevant', 'hope', 'people', 'started', 'getting', 'tested', 'especially', 'considering', 'two', 'characters', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'married', 'Chantell', 'Christopher', 'always', 'entertaining', 'role', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'LOVED', 'scene', 'doctor', 'rubbing', 'kiss', 'lips', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'definitely', 'how', 'pick', 'guys', 'film', 'eye', 'candy', 'rewatch', 'movie', ""'m"", 'fast-forwarding', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'scenes', 'first', 'Everybody', 'who', 'DVD', 'please', 'watch', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'Cast', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'Goes', 'Shopping', 'was', 'too', 'amazed', 'clothes', 'even', 'laugh', 'up', 'talked', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'Hilarious', 'could', 'rate', 'movie', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'alone', ""'d"", 'be', 'five', 'stars', 'However', 'Cons', 'jokes', 'play', 'are', 'recycled', 'such', 'one', 'going', 'Charlotte', 'North', 'Carolina', 'reminded', 'Madea', 'Goes', 'Jail', 'when', 'Madea', 'said', 'had', 'get', 'back', 'Conyers', '[', 'GA', ']', 'where', '[', ']', 'knew', 'somebody', 'telling', 'one', 'guy', 'Augusta', 'location', 'jokes', 'were', 'cool', 'first', 'round', 'time', 'let', 'die', 'now.There', 'was', 'also', 'comment', 'single', 'mother', 'made', '25', 'ex-fling', 'spend', 'time', 'son', 'was', 'similar', 'scene', 'Meet', 'Browns', 'as', 'well', 'Dad', 'coming', 'back', 'when', 'son', 'blew', 'up', 'Speaking', 'son', 'was', 'age', 'was', 'completely', 'confused', 'when', 'mother', 'was', 'talking', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'anybody', 'who', 'looked', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'guy', 'was', 'cute', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'high', 'school', 'age', 'was', 'going', 'for.The', 'songs', 'were', 'excellent', 'enjoyed', 'singers', 'voices', 'as', 'soon', 'started', 'doing', 'runs', 'was', 'driving', 'nuts', 'hate', 'when', 'people', 'oversing', 'song', 'Patti', 'LaBelle', 'fans', 'love', 'kind', 'stuff', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'necessary', 'sing', 'same', 'note', '20', 'minutes', 'However', 'runs', ""'d"", 'give', 'songs', '10', 'whole', 'speech', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'receipts', 'mother', 'was', 'bunch', 'nonsense', 'would', 'be', 'done', 'regardless', 'child', 'support', 'wish', 'would', ""'ve"", 'named', 'something', 'involved', 'money', 'ex', 'school', 'funds', 'food', 'shelter', 'transportation', 'school', 'babysitter', 'diapers', 'clothes', 'shoes', 'college', 'savings', 'allowance', 'one', 'nurse', 'who', 'kept', 'making', 'passes', 'doctor', 'was', 'doing', 'whole', 'lot', 'overacting', 'making', 'goofy', 'noises', 'first', 'couple', 'times', 'was', 'extremely', 'annoying', 'complete', 'overkill', 'learn', 'comedic', 'timing', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'so', 'funny', ""'d"", 'have', 'calmed', 'down', 'just', 'little', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'did', ""n't"", 'critique', 'great', 'timing', 'Madea', 'character', 'Madea', 'brother', 'Joe.One', 'last', 'thing', 'Why', 'would', 'someone', 'keep', 'calling', 'father', 'Mr.', 'Brown']",Tyler Perry's What's Done in the Dark... - The Play Collection

One just kept screaming and overacting...I kept forwarding whenever she came back on the set because she wasn't funny and the screaming was nerve wracking.
