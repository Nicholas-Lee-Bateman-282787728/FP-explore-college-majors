564933,A3AY3EV2MFRFGG,B000053UWC,"Chadwick H. Saxelid ""Bookworm""","[2, 2]","Island of the Dead is one of those bad movies that I still find something to like about because I just find the concept so interesting/promising.  Multi-millionaire developer Rupert King (Malcolm McDowell) has engineered a new low income housing community for the homeless of New York City to be built on Hart Island.  Hart Island (a real place) is the Potter's Field of New York, where the homeless and lost are buried in mass graves.  What no one realizes is that King has darker motives (linked to his ties with medical research) in store for the future residents of Hope City.  Meanwhile a Missing Persons detective (Talisa Soto in a wasted role) is tracking down the last victim of 'The Double Dutch Killings' in hopes of laying to rest the haunting image of the dead girls skipping rope.  This is a hope that most of the audience will share, as we see the trio skipping rope and chanting a morbid little ditty over and over and over and over again.  Sadly screenwriters Tim Southam (who also directed) and Peter Koper (who came up with the promising idea) fail to develop these two storylines or the characters and their subplots in any great detail.  This forces director Southam to pad the movie with far too many 'atmospheric' music montages and gives co-star Talisa Soto nothing to do but look sullen and haunted (this after giving her character an intriguing introduction, pity).  Sadly the 'vengeful fury of the dead' is unleashed via a hord of illness inducing insects (as opposed to simple zombies) with little information given to the viewer as to why it is happening.  One or two ghostly spectres or whispering voices would have helped, so you can add the trio of little girls to the list of missed opportunities.  What this movie badly needed was a major reworking of its core story elements, especially in regards to the supernatural aspects in the second and third acts, then, perhaps, it might have been better.  If you really want to depress yourself, just think what Terence Fisher, Jimmy Sangster (or John Elder), Peter Cushing, and Christopher Lee could have done with this material back in the glory days of Hammer Studios.

564935,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000053UWC,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[6, 8]","This movie forces one to pose that age-old question: why do terrific actors like Malcolm McDowell make these kinds of sub par movies?  The basic premise has potential: take an island harboring what is left of the remains of almost a million of society's castaways, bring in a ruthless businessman determined to remake the island into a ""Hope City"" for the poor and homeless (while secretly pursuing his own less magnanimous plans for the future population), have the dead somehow put their ethereal foot down in opposition, and wait for all the fun to happen.  Alas, these dead souls are a rather lazy, unimaginative lot choosing to manifest themselves as worms and bugs-sure, the bugs are really, really annoyed and aggressive, but they're still just bugs.  I would hope that any future manifestations of my own future dead self will be much more noteworthy.  It's cool to see dead bodies bloated and bursting with creepy crawlies mere hours after death, but this is the sort of thing one tends to view as a precursor of more ambitious tragedies to come, not as a be all and end all in itself.  In case you think all the worm stuff sounds incredibly gross, it really isn't.  While there are plenty of maggots bursting forth from chests and stomachs, there is not even one good mouth-exiting maggot shot to satisfy horror fans like myself who sort of expect that type of thing from a movie like this.The fact that I didn't like two of the most important characters also didn't help my enjoyment of this movie.  You have a tough lady cop who investigates missing children, but she has sort of an attitude, and the whole missing children theme seemed nothing more than a ruse for explaining why she was out on Hart Island in the first place (and the images of three presumably formerly missing girls jumping rope every ten minutes became utterly annoying).  Then there is the convict working funeral duty who complains about being arrested and beaten up unjustly; one uncharacteristic bit of aggressive dialogue from him soured me on his good graces.  There is one great character that provides a lot of much-needed humor during the first half of the film, for which I thank him.  Finally, we have Malcolm McDowell, who does deliver a typically fine performance in a role he could not have been enthused over; of course, playing a twisted, uncaring millionaire isn't the kind of role one has to master Stanislavsky's techniques in order to pull off.  When all is said and done, this movie fails to deliver the types of creeps and thrills its title obviously brings to mind, and the characters are too shallow to merit much attention.  It's not bad or unwatchable, but there is just nothing about it that demands your attention or gory indulgence.",3,"The worms crawl in, the worms crawl out",1043280000,"01 23, 2003",2003,2744,"['movie', 'one', 'pose', 'age-old', 'question', 'why', 'do', 'terrific', 'actors', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'make', 'kinds', 'sub', 'par', 'movies', 'basic', 'premise', 'potential', 'take', 'island', 'harboring', 'what', 'left', 'remains', 'almost', 'million', 'society', 'castaways', 'bring', 'ruthless', 'businessman', 'determined', 'remake', 'island', 'Hope', 'City', 'poor', 'homeless', 'secretly', 'pursuing', 'own', 'less', 'magnanimous', 'plans', 'future', 'population', 'have', 'dead', 'somehow', 'put', 'ethereal', 'foot', 'down', 'opposition', 'wait', 'fun', 'happen', 'Alas', 'dead', 'souls', 'are', 'rather', 'lazy', 'unimaginative', 'lot', 'choosing', 'manifest', 'worms', 'bugs-sure', 'bugs', 'are', 'really', 'really', 'annoyed', 'aggressive', ""'re"", 'still', 'just', 'bugs', 'would', 'hope', 'future', 'manifestations', 'own', 'future', 'dead', 'self', 'will', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'noteworthy', 'cool', 'see', 'dead', 'bodies', 'bloated', 'bursting', 'creepy', 'crawlies', 'mere', 'hours', 'death', 'sort', 'thing', 'one', 'view', 'precursor', 'more', 'ambitious', 'tragedies', 'come', 'not', 'be', 'end', 'case', 'think', 'worm', 'stuff', 'incredibly', 'gross', 'really', ""n't"", 'are', 'plenty', 'maggots', 'bursting', 'forth', 'chests', 'stomachs', 'not', 'even', 'one', 'good', 'mouth-exiting', 'maggot', 'shot', 'satisfy', 'horror', 'fans', 'who', 'sort', 'expect', 'type', 'thing', 'movie', 'this.The', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'two', 'most', 'important', 'characters', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'have', 'tough', 'lady', 'cop', 'who', 'missing', 'children', 'sort', 'attitude', 'whole', 'missing', 'children', 'theme', 'seemed', 'nothing', 'more', 'ruse', 'explaining', 'why', 'was', 'out', 'Hart', 'Island', 'first', 'place', 'images', 'three', 'presumably', 'formerly', 'missing', 'girls', 'jumping', 'rope', 'ten', 'minutes', 'became', 'utterly', 'annoying', 'Then', 'convict', 'working', 'funeral', 'duty', 'who', 'being', 'arrested', 'beaten', 'up', 'unjustly', 'one', 'uncharacteristic', 'bit', 'aggressive', 'dialogue', 'soured', 'good', 'graces', 'one', 'great', 'character', 'lot', 'much-needed', 'humor', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'thank', 'Finally', 'have', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'who', 'deliver', 'typically', 'fine', 'performance', 'role', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'enthused', 'course', 'playing', 'twisted', 'uncaring', 'millionaire', ""n't"", 'kind', 'role', 'one', 'master', 'Stanislavsky', 'techniques', 'order', 'pull', 'off', 'When', 'said', 'done', 'movie', 'deliver', 'types', 'creeps', 'title', 'obviously', 'mind', 'characters', 'are', 'too', 'shallow', 'merit', 'much', 'attention', 'not', 'bad', 'unwatchable', 'just', 'nothing', 'attention', 'gory', 'indulgence']",Island of the Dead

Children of the Dead level of bad.First off, Talisa Soto is one fine looking specimen, but she's aged to a point where she can't pull off either Lara Croft or Vampirella, both of which were modeling gigs she had when she was younger. She even played Vampirella in the horrible movie version with Roger Daltrey as the heavy.I don't know what they thought they were doing when they made this movie. The locale, Harts Island, is sufficiently creepy. A million bodies, mostly of the indigent have been buried there and should make for a good creepfest, except it isn't used much.The bad guys are flies which are never seen clearly, although sometimes their perspective is employed by jerky camera moves that detract very strongly from the story.  These jerk action moves are very obviously done on a tripod as all the jerks are across one direction or span. Whats more, the actual cinematography is poor.  Sometimes, there would be a sweep across abandonned buildings (which we are told in an interesting story onc e housed the quarantined sick and then, later, the mad. This plotline is never brought up again) that goes right to left and then, inexplicably reversed halfway. Bad filming.The flies themselves are laughable and there is no gore worth watching.We should have a separate discussion about any movie starring Malcolm ""If-Theres-A-Check-Involved-I-am-So-There"" McDowell.  He phones in his performance, pretty much like he's done in every movie since Tank Girl (last decent performance from him that I saw).It has NOTHING to do with the Dead Universe, despite the title. Some people do die but their deaths are ridiculous.The only person worth watching was the island manager, who actually was kind of interesting. I've never seen him before, have no idea what his name is, but he was pretty cool.Mos Def is also in the movie, for the inane rap music connection.",1,BAD BAD BAD movie!,1089676800,"07 13, 2004",2004,1983,"['Watched', 'tripe', 'last', 'night', 'heard', 'supposed', 'good', 'things', 'when', 'were', 'making', 'BAD', 'BAD', 'BAD', 'movie', 'Children', 'Dead', 'level', 'bad.First', 'Talisa', 'Soto', 'one', 'fine', 'looking', 'specimen', 'aged', 'point', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'Lara', 'Croft', 'Vampirella', 'were', 'modeling', 'gigs', 'had', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'even', 'played', 'Vampirella', 'horrible', 'movie', 'version', 'Roger', 'Daltrey', 'heavy.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'thought', 'were', 'doing', 'when', 'made', 'movie', 'locale', 'Harts', 'Island', 'sufficiently', 'creepy', 'million', 'bodies', 'mostly', 'indigent', 'have', 'been', 'buried', 'should', 'make', 'good', 'creepfest', ""n't"", 'used', 'much.The', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'flies', 'are', 'never', 'seen', 'clearly', 'sometimes', 'perspective', 'employed', 'jerky', 'camera', 'detract', 'very', 'strongly', 'story', 'jerk', 'action', 'moves', 'are', 'very', 'obviously', 'done', 'tripod', 'jerks', 'are', 'one', 'direction', 'span', 'Whats', 'more', 'actual', 'cinematography', 'poor', 'Sometimes', 'would', 'be', 'sweep', 'across', 'abandonned', 'buildings', 'are', 'told', 'interesting', 'story', 'onc', 'e', 'housed', 'quarantined', 'sick', 'then', 'later', 'mad', 'plotline', 'never', 'brought', 'up', 'again', 'right', 'left', 'then', 'inexplicably', 'reversed', 'halfway', 'Bad', 'filming.The', 'flies', 'are', 'laughable', 'gore', 'worth', 'watching.We', 'should', 'have', 'separate', 'discussion', 'movie', 'starring', 'Malcolm', 'If-Theres-A-Check-Involved-I-am-So-There', 'McDowell', 'performance', 'pretty', 'much', 'done', 'movie', 'Tank', 'Girl', 'last', 'decent', 'performance', 'saw', '.It', 'NOTHING', 'do', 'Dead', 'Universe', 'title', 'people', 'do', 'die', 'deaths', 'are', 'ridiculous.The', 'only', 'person', 'worth', 'watching', 'was', 'island', 'manager', 'who', 'actually', 'was', 'kind', 'interesting', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'name', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool.Mos', 'Def', 'also', 'movie', 'inane', 'rap', 'music', 'connection']",Island of the Dead

You can tell because the screen fades to black every 15 minutes or so for the commercial break.This is a very low budget affair, making for a very low-key horror film.  It's supposedly set on New York City's Hart's Island (where the city runs a potter's field for burying the impoverished or unidentified dead), but NYC can't be seen over the horizon as the ferry crosses the water.  Just an insert shot of Manhattan at film's start to set the location.Then there's the shot where Talisa Soto (who plays a cop) walks down Manhattan, glass skyscrapers behind her.  She looks across at a ghetto-like street with boarded-up buildings.  Obviously not shot on the same location.  Editing those two shots together was truly unconvincing.Story concerns evil rich man Malcolm McDowell (playing a casino owner/developer named ""The Rupert"" -- as in, ""The Donald"" Trump), who is building a low-income community on the island -- with sinister motives.  He arrives on Hart's Island with an entourage and these evil flies attack.  But they do so after most of the entourage has left, so there are very few actors on this island to attack.  Just The Rupert and a handful of cops and prisoners burying the dead on potter's field.Here's some sloppy story-telling: seems the flies only want to kill The Rupert, because when he dies, they stop.  Talisa Soto marvels that the flies were after him.  But then ... why did the flies kill several other people earlier in the film, and ignore The Rupert?Anyway, the flies' bite is deadly, causing you to puff up in a disgusting manner before you die.  Not a real gory film, but there is some creepy atmosphere.  It actually helps that the low budget only allowed for a few actors.  The location is nice -- a deserted island with abandoned buildings and grave markers.  And the gray Canadian sky helps -- very much like in THE X-FILES.  It's obviously not New York, but it makes for a decent horror film.  Not great, but decent.I disagree with the reviewer who said Talisa Soto looks old.  She looks quite young, still.  However, she looks awfully thin.  Her face is so tight and thin, it's almost skull-like.  I'd heard a story from a film industry friend that on the set of VAMPIRILLA, Soto was so thin, they had trouble keeping her costume from slipping off.Somebody get this girl a milkshake and fries, fast!The DVD is remarkably crappy, in that there is NO MENU.  No special features, not even a scene selection.  You pop in the DVD and go straight to the movie.

Today, however, there are other events transpiring on the island that go beyond the atypical, because the almost-billionare Rupert King (Malcolm McDowell) has decided that this would be the perfect sight for his new project, Hope Island. Here, the poor would find themselves housed in accommodations that seem at first questionable and later a bit more sinister, providing them with nameless jobs and the &quot;helping hand&quot; they deserve. And everything seems to be going well for his venture, too, until the dead decide to thrown in their proverbial two cents on the topic in ways that seething with disdain.Island of the Dead had many things that seemingly made it viewable in the beginning, including the casting of McDowell and some support characters like Mos Def that prodded the story along as they were introduced into a setting that seemed particularly horrifying; with shadowy buildings of forgotten internment camps and asylums dotting an otherwise barren island of lost souls. Still, it began to disappoint as the storyline dragged its heels in the sands of multiple fragmentations that didn't mesh with any consistency as the movie tried to move forward and as the dead began to make their presence known.Still, my main problem was not this, but the way the dead and their angst was handled. In fact, this was one of the worst parts of the film itself, with the angry souls manifesting themselves as flies and the ever-frightening mealworm and never truly doing anything save biting people they didn't seem to car for, infecting the person they've bitten, and then managing to use their bodies as fleshy hatcheries and making it decompose at an astounding rate. Going further into this problem, anytime these spirits decided to assail someone, the camera would do so from a jerky &quot;fly cam&quot; perspective that was bathed in blue and gave me something of a headache, with no reward manifesting itself for these woes that I felt. For this reason alone, considering that the movie's cast would only be considered support characters to the beasts stalking them, was a major reason I found it so unsettlingly bad and wouldn't recommend it to anyone save the bravest or most uninformed of souls.",2,Manifestions and the Menacing MealWorm,1042934400,"01 19, 2003",2003,2624,"['Welcome', 'Hart', 'Island', 'New', 'York', 'home', 'almost', 'million', 'disenfranchised', 'dead', 'Here', 'toil', 'endless', 'streams', 'bodies', 'fill', 'labelless', 'confines', 'vast', 'potter', 'field', 'working', 'off', 'short-term', 'sentences', 'ways', 'involve', 'unceremoniously', 'hauling', 'cheaply', 'boxed', 'deceased', 'dump', 'trucks', 'digging', 'mass', 'graves', 'individuals', 'then', 'conveyor-belting', 'dead', 'Today', 'however', 'are', 'other', 'events', 'transpiring', 'island', 'go', 'atypical', 'almost-billionare', 'Rupert', 'King', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'decided', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'sight', 'new', 'project', 'Hope', 'Island', 'Here', 'poor', 'would', 'find', 'housed', 'accommodations', 'seem', 'first', 'questionable', 'later', 'bit', 'more', 'sinister', 'providing', 'nameless', 'jobs', 'quot', 'helping', 'hand', 'quot', 'deserve', 'everything', 'be', 'going', 'well', 'venture', 'too', 'dead', 'decide', 'thrown', 'proverbial', 'two', 'cents', 'topic', 'ways', 'seething', 'disdain.Island', 'Dead', 'had', 'many', 'things', 'seemingly', 'made', 'viewable', 'beginning', 'including', 'casting', 'McDowell', 'support', 'characters', 'Mos', 'Def', 'prodded', 'story', 'were', 'introduced', 'setting', 'seemed', 'particularly', 'horrifying', 'shadowy', 'buildings', 'forgotten', 'internment', 'camps', 'asylums', 'dotting', 'otherwise', 'barren', 'island', 'lost', 'souls', 'Still', 'began', 'disappoint', 'storyline', 'dragged', 'heels', 'sands', 'multiple', 'fragmentations', 'did', ""n't"", 'mesh', 'consistency', 'movie', 'tried', 'move', 'forward', 'dead', 'began', 'make', 'presence', 'known.Still', 'main', 'problem', 'was', 'not', 'way', 'dead', 'angst', 'was', 'handled', 'fact', 'was', 'one', 'worst', 'parts', 'film', 'angry', 'souls', 'manifesting', 'flies', 'ever-frightening', 'mealworm', 'never', 'truly', 'doing', 'anything', 'save', 'biting', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'car', 'infecting', 'person', ""'ve"", 'bitten', 'then', 'managing', 'use', 'bodies', 'fleshy', 'hatcheries', 'making', 'decompose', 'astounding', 'rate', 'Going', 'further', 'problem', 'anytime', 'spirits', 'decided', 'assail', 'someone', 'camera', 'would', 'do', 'so', 'jerky', 'quot', 'cam', 'quot', 'perspective', 'was', 'bathed', 'blue', 'gave', 'something', 'headache', 'reward', 'manifesting', 'woes', 'felt', 'reason', 'alone', 'considering', 'movie', 'cast', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'considered', 'support', 'characters', 'beasts', 'stalking', 'was', 'major', 'reason', 'found', 'so', 'unsettlingly', 'bad', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'save', 'bravest', 'most', 'uninformed', 'souls']",Island of the Dead

McDowell plays a charming and ruthless real estate magnate with an eye on developing a housing/business complex on an island currently serving as a potter's field for New York's unclaimed departed.  There's a dark side to the millionaire's plans, and the island doesn't take on the idea of change well.  Soon there are supernatural happenings plaguing those assembled on the island.The film reminds me of the old black & white Val Lewton movies which stressed character and mood over action - thereby saving somewhat on expense.  The menace is simply supernatural and not as well defined as I would have liked, but over all it works within the chilling story set on the island.  The characters are somewhat engaging and manage to rise at least one level over the stock characters of most horror films I've seen of late.  McDowell is the best thing about the film, crafting a character who despite an evil motivation remains both human and fun to watch.",4,The Dead Dislike Company.,1347926400,"09 18, 2012",2012,1152,"['Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'long', 'been', 'favorite', 'actor', 'mine', 'charasmatic', 'performances', 'numerous', 'pictures', 'genre', 'was', 'name', 'enticed', 'get', 'atmospheric', 'horror', 'film', 'McDowell', 'charming', 'ruthless', 'real', 'estate', 'magnate', 'eye', 'developing', 'housing/business', 'complex', 'island', 'currently', 'serving', 'potter', 'field', 'New', 'York', 'unclaimed', 'departed', 'dark', 'side', 'millionaire', 'plans', 'island', ""n't"", 'take', 'idea', 'change', 'well', 'Soon', 'are', 'supernatural', 'happenings', 'plaguing', 'assembled', 'island.The', 'film', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'Val', 'Lewton', 'movies', 'stressed', 'character', 'mood', 'action', 'thereby', 'saving', 'somewhat', 'expense', 'menace', 'simply', 'supernatural', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'defined', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'chilling', 'story', 'set', 'island', 'characters', 'are', 'somewhat', 'engaging', 'manage', 'rise', 'least', 'one', 'level', 'stock', 'characters', 'most', 'horror', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'late', 'McDowell', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'crafting', 'character', 'who', 'evil', 'motivation', 'human', 'fun', 'watch']",Island of the Dead
