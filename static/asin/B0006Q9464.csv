872256,A3PIPHWD45VOGI,B0006Q9464,Ace-of-Stars,"[11, 16]","~Boy, the possibilities are almost endless with the number of catchy 'review headings' anyone can come up with -- both in favor of AND in disrespect to this movie. Based upon what I had read from others who had seen this film prior to its availability in DVD NTSC-1 encoding, I had originally planned to title my review as:""The tele-'PHONE' is 'RING'-ing!""-- or something to that effect, because one of the things most commonly heard about this movie was that it was basically another twist on Nakata Hideo's ""RING"" (which now seems to be becoming the new 'standard' by which ALL new Asian horror is to compared -- much like Sean Connery's ""James Bond"" being the ""OO7"" all subsequent assumers of the role are to be judged against, I suppose). I had to cancel the idea for such a title heading, however, once I had actually sat through the movie for the first time.Without a doubt, there are a number of things reminiscent of ""RING"" -- most notably the 'vengeful spirit lashing out via some modern-day electronic device' (in this case, a cellular phone) and a female reporter associated with it intent on tracking the cursed technology back to its source (though not initially intended in this case, her actions instead being in response to a series of bizarre events; whereas the reporter in ""RING"" was investigating the legend of the 'cursed video' from the very beginning as part of her story).A reporter named Ji-won, who exposes a ring of criminal activity of the worst kind, receives threatening calls from one of the perpetrators who got rounded up in the police sweep resulted from her expose. Though the harassing calls are coming from someone who makes it more than clear that she is being stalked, the reporter makes the unwise assumption that if she simply changes the number on her cell phone the angry party will eventually have to give up on trying to keep her in a state of fear and panic (she's led to believe that the danger is not real, and that the threats are only part of a psychological manipulation the criminal is playing). When she applies for the new number, only one particular number keeps appearing on the computer screen as being available. Time being precious as it is, she decides not to nit-pick over it and takes the number the computer glitch keeps coughing up.Things then go from bad to worse, as she begins receiving a new set of calls on the new number. This has a very negative affect on little Yeong-Ju, the reporter's ""niece,"" who happened to be the very first person to answer the phone when it rang on the new number. As a result of what she heard on the other end of the line, the little girl experiences psychological trauma and undergoes some very disturbed & disturbing behaviors, which often expresses itself as fits of rage -- especially whenever her father becomes intimate with his wife. Psychological examinations show nothing to be too concerned about, suggesting that it is just a passing phase -- but as Yeong-Ju's behavior becomes more destructive (both self-destructive as well as projected outward) and more violent, her ""auntie"" uses her investigative skills as a reporter to track down the history of the phone number she adopted in order to determine what sort of connection it may have for the strange effect upon the little girl's mind. The answers she finds are not pretty, as everything comes full circle.One of the things which bothered me at first, but then grew on me favorably, was the number of ""false climaxes."" Typically most people become annoyed by this sort of manipulation, but once this movie reveals its final secrets, you should wind up appreciating the beauty and mastery in the way each layer was pulled back and each new revelation led to the moment of ""orgasmic release,"" if you will.Sure, there are those cliches which now come standard in your typical Asian ghost story fare. But, suffice it to say, although this movie is no ""RING,"" it is also no ""RING.""P.S. -You'll just adore (in an uneasy sort of way) the little girl who plays Yeong-Ju. You'll really feel for her even as you're being totally freaked-&-creeped by her. Wedding bells for Yeong-Ju and Toshio are surely in the making :)",4,"Okay, no cutesy 'Review Title' this time....",1107475200,"02 4, 2005",2005,4174,"['~Boy', 'possibilities', 'are', 'almost', 'endless', 'number', 'catchy', 'headings', 'anyone', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'favor', 'AND', 'disrespect', 'movie', 'Based', 'what', 'had', 'read', 'others', 'who', 'had', 'seen', 'film', 'prior', 'availability', 'DVD', 'NTSC-1', 'encoding', 'had', 'originally', 'planned', 'title', 'review', ""tele-'PHONE"", ""'RING'-ing"", 'something', 'effect', 'one', 'things', 'most', 'commonly', 'heard', 'movie', 'was', 'was', 'basically', 'twist', 'Nakata', 'Hideo', 'RING', 'now', 'be', 'becoming', 'new', ""'standard"", 'ALL', 'new', 'Asian', 'horror', 'compared', 'much', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'James', 'Bond', 'being', 'OO7', 'subsequent', 'assumers', 'role', 'are', 'be', 'judged', 'suppose', 'had', 'cancel', 'idea', 'such', 'title', 'heading', 'however', 'once', 'had', 'actually', 'sat', 'movie', 'first', 'time.Without', 'doubt', 'are', 'number', 'things', 'reminiscent', 'RING', 'most', 'notably', ""'vengeful"", 'spirit', 'lashing', 'out', 'modern-day', 'electronic', 'device', 'case', 'cellular', 'phone', 'female', 'reporter', 'associated', 'intent', 'tracking', 'cursed', 'technology', 'back', 'source', 'not', 'initially', 'intended', 'case', 'actions', 'instead', 'being', 'response', 'series', 'bizarre', 'events', 'reporter', 'RING', 'was', 'investigating', 'legend', ""'cursed"", 'video', 'very', 'beginning', 'part', 'story', '.A', 'reporter', 'named', 'Ji-won', 'who', 'ring', 'criminal', 'activity', 'worst', 'kind', 'threatening', 'calls', 'one', 'perpetrators', 'who', 'got', 'rounded', 'up', 'police', 'sweep', 'resulted', 'expose', 'harassing', 'calls', 'are', 'coming', 'someone', 'who', 'more', 'clear', 'being', 'stalked', 'reporter', 'unwise', 'assumption', 'simply', 'number', 'cell', 'phone', 'angry', 'party', 'will', 'eventually', 'have', 'give', 'up', 'trying', 'keep', 'state', 'fear', 'panic', 'led', 'believe', 'danger', 'not', 'real', 'threats', 'are', 'only', 'part', 'psychological', 'manipulation', 'criminal', 'playing', 'When', 'new', 'number', 'only', 'one', 'particular', 'number', 'keeps', 'appearing', 'computer', 'screen', 'being', 'available', 'Time', 'being', 'precious', 'not', 'nit-pick', 'number', 'computer', 'glitch', 'coughing', 'up.Things', 'then', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'receiving', 'new', 'set', 'calls', 'new', 'number', 'very', 'negative', 'affect', 'little', 'Yeong-Ju', 'reporter', 'niece', 'who', 'happened', 'be', 'very', 'first', 'person', 'answer', 'phone', 'when', 'rang', 'new', 'number', 'result', 'what', 'heard', 'other', 'end', 'line', 'little', 'girl', 'experiences', 'psychological', 'trauma', 'undergoes', 'very', 'disturbed', 'disturbing', 'behaviors', 'often', 'fits', 'rage', 'especially', 'whenever', 'father', 'intimate', 'wife', 'Psychological', 'examinations', 'show', 'nothing', 'be', 'too', 'concerned', 'suggesting', 'just', 'passing', 'phase', 'Yeong-Ju', 'behavior', 'more', 'destructive', 'self-destructive', 'as', 'well', 'projected', 'outward', 'more', 'violent', 'auntie', 'investigative', 'skills', 'reporter', 'track', 'down', 'history', 'phone', 'number', 'adopted', 'order', 'determine', 'what', 'sort', 'connection', 'may', 'have', 'strange', 'effect', 'little', 'girl', 'mind', 'answers', 'finds', 'are', 'not', 'pretty', 'everything', 'full', 'circle.One', 'things', 'bothered', 'first', 'then', 'grew', 'favorably', 'was', 'number', 'false', 'climaxes', 'Typically', 'most', 'people', 'become', 'annoyed', 'sort', 'manipulation', 'once', 'movie', 'final', 'secrets', 'should', 'wind', 'up', 'appreciating', 'beauty', 'mastery', 'way', 'layer', 'was', 'pulled', 'back', 'new', 'revelation', 'led', 'moment', 'orgasmic', 'release', 'will.Sure', 'are', 'cliches', 'now', 'come', 'standard', 'typical', 'Asian', 'ghost', 'story', 'fare', 'say', 'movie', 'RING', 'also', 'RING.', 'P.S', '-You', ""'ll"", 'just', 'adore', 'uneasy', 'sort', 'way', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'Yeong-Ju', ""'ll"", 'really', 'feel', 'even', ""'re"", 'being', 'totally', 'freaked-', '-creeped', 'Wedding', 'bells', 'Yeong-Ju', 'Toshio', 'are', 'surely', 'making']",Phone

872260,A20IIR0422G3A5,B0006Q9464,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[3, 4]","`Phone', by Korean director, Ahn Byong Ki, is clearly done in imitation of recent, successful Japanese films such as `Ring' and `Dark Water'. These have been so successful that Hollywood almost immediately remakes them, which always seems to loose something in the translation. On the other hand, Hollywood does seem to avoid some of the obscurities I often find in the plots and editing of these otherwise excellently styled films.I'm embarrassed to say that one problem I often find in these Asian productions is that very often, the two main characters look so much alike that it is often hard to tell the difference between the two, especially in matters relating to the plot. This is understandable in that every time it occurs, the two characters are sisters who will understandably look alike, but in this movie, it is particularly difficult, as both characters are young adults, with virtually no sign such as age to distinguish between the two.On the other hand, as with all these films, the cinematography, staging, and editing are simply flawless. When the movie opens, I find the simplicity of the images on the screen to be achingly beautiful as well as subtly horrifying. And, this finely measured craft is maintained throughout the film.One thing all these movies seem to do is to master the attribute which has for so long been Stephen King's signature in turning the ordinary, such as a big dog or the common cold or a 1958 Plymouth Fury into something horrible. In this case, it's the cellphone. While the title seems to implicate all telephones, the perp in virtually every scene in the movie is the ubiquitous ultrathin! Oddly, the source of the phantom telephone calls is traced to a hard-wired telephone line.I will probably give away nothing to detract from the pleasure of watching the movie if I revealed anything of the plot, since the details of the plot are almost irrelevant to the experience. The story moves in such a circuitous and disconnected manner that it is hard to make sense of how one gets from the initial images to the end of the movie, which seems to not really succeed in resolving the story.One disturbing thing about the movie is that it plays the `child in peril' card, which many may find disturbing. The single most famous instance of this gambit is near the end of `Aliens', when Ripley must rescue Newt from the most horrific mama alien. I recall the chagrin with this business and am surprised to see in as many films as I do, including this one.In spare outline, the story regards a journalist who has done a series or articles on sex scandals and who begins to get threatening telephone calls, seemingly connected with these stories. The problem for the viewer is that this story line goes nowhere and the plot switches to dealing with the spirit of a murdered young woman whose ghost invades the niece of the journalist.As I'm writing this, pieces are starting to come together, and I have the sense that part of the problem may be in the translation from the spoken Korean to the English subtitles. Unlike for German and French, I can make absolutely no sense of the Korean, but I suspect that something may be `lost in translation'.Since all the extras are spoken in Korean with subtitles as well, they are not quite as good as, for example, the English commentary we get on films by, for example Jean Renoir and Pierre Truffout, but they are welcome.If you like other `Asian' horror movies, you are sure to like this one and the story line is obscure enough to require at least two or three viewings to figure everything out.",4,Starkly beautiful Korean horror.

After her best friend's daughter accidentally receives one of the calls, the girl begins behaving erratically.  The only clue Ji-Won has to go on is the phone number that keeps appearing on her laptop, so she begins to look into the people who had her number previously, and what she finds is interesting indeed.I'll be the first to admit that the premise of a supernatural force utilizing a cellular phone seemed hokey, but as the story progresses, the device is shown to not be a contrivance at all.  Even if this weren't the case, I'd still rate the movie highly.  It's simply a very effective scary movie, especially during the first half.

But when Yeong-ju, the young daughter of a friend, answers one of these same calls, she becomes immediately changed.  Ji-won must figure out the reason behind these strange calls if she's to have any chance to save Yeong-ju from the self-destructive path the phone seems to have put her on.There's some genuine mystery to this film, which keeps it from becoming simply another retread horror movie.  Our heroine has to unravel the mystery - both who the phone number originally belonged to, and why it causes such misery to those who come in contact.The acting is outstanding.  Ji-won Ha is excellent in the lead role, and Seo-woo Eun steals several scenes as the ""possessed"" young girl.  The direction is perfect, with muted colors and plenty of silence adding to the film's creepiness.

It just made things confusing.A few things I disliked:Bland CharactersFirst of all, there were several young, female characters who were indistinguishable from one another. They were all about the same age and nothing stood out about them. There was such such a lack of character development, (they were introduced sporadically throughout the film) and I had hard time keeping track of who was who. By the time I started to understand what was going on, the movie was half-way over.Abandoned Story LinesThe sex scandal, the stalker, the detective--it's like they started writing one screenplay stopped then started writing another one then just spliced the two together.I did like the latter part of the story and seeing how the husband's infidelity had actually caused the problems he was having with his young daughter and wife, but it's hard to see how this is related to all the other deaths and cell phone number being possessed. It should have been one or the other, a reporter stalked by someone she was exposing or the ghost of a schoolgirl takes revenge on the married man that dumped her. As with a lot of Japanese and Korean horror films, there were too many story lines going on to make a coherent movie.The name of the movie is Phone, but actually, the use of phones as a scare tactic seemed out of place with everything else that was going on.

Many viewers pointed out that this film reminded them of the Japanese film ""RINGU."" However, as for myself, the film reminded me a lot of the horror films ONE MISSED CALL, and ONE MISSED CALL 2. [The former being directed by Takashi Miike]. What this film lacked, that these two other films had, in my opinion, was a good story, creepy scenes, and a lot more scare factor. This film may appeal to some viewers, as witnessed by the number of those who liked it. However, the film has a few sub-plots going along with the narrative that make this film a bit disjointed.The film centers on a woman reporter named Ji-won (Ji-won Ha). Ji-won has just exposed a sex ring of several men with underage girls. As a result, this has put her life in jeopardy. She is constantly being harassed through her cellphone with death threats. Furthermore, she is being pursued by one of these men. Therefore, for her protection, Ji-won decides to take up an offer to stay at the Bangbae house of her friends, which is still being renovated by her friends husband, Chang-hoon (Woo-jae Choi). Her friend Ho-jeong (Yu-mi Kim) does not think that the house is suitable, and tries to dissuade Ji-won in a polite way. Yet, with the upcoming trial ahead of her, and for her protection, she takes Chang-hoon up on his offer. There is something ominous in this new house, and I do not wish to give this away.Moreover, there is something wrong with the young daughter of her friends. Young-ju (Seo-woo Eun) answers Ji-won's cellphone while at an art exhibit, and afterwards begins exhibiting bizarre behavior. The child  becomes more attached to her father, and more distant from the mother. Why? What is the cause of this young child's behavior that has changed drastically since she listened in on the cellphone? Plus, something strange is happening in the house Ji-won is now living at. Not only does Ji-won still receive strange phone calls, but she also receives eerie pictures on her laptop computer. Determined to discover what is happening, Ji-won becomes convinced that she and the young child are in danger from a ghost. The film is predictable, and for the most part boring. If you must see the film, rent it first. I did not think this was a particularly good horror film. And what few horror scenes the viewer is witness to is not enough to salvage this film. I recommend viewers rent the film first.

872272,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B0006Q9464,General Zombie,"[1, 1]","It's been a few months since I saw this film, but what I have to say doesn't need that many details.  First of all, I'm a pretty big horror fan, but I can't totally get into the Asian horror film scene of the last decade or so.  Sure, there are a number of great films that I've seen, (Cure, Audition, Tale of Two Sisters, Uzumaki) but I find it tough to come up with too much enthusiasm for seeing that many more films from the the period.  The movement seems to basically be a combination of generic girl-ghost and a number of oddball horror/exploitation films that don't fit into any particular subgenre, or sound particularly thrilling to me.  This is one of those generic girl-ghost ones.  It's pretty well done, nicely shot and whatnot, much slicker than say Ringu or Ju-On or the original Dark Water but I don't think this subgenre needs to be endlessly repeated.  I don't actually have anything against the girl-ghost movie in and of itself, but it's too narrow to allow for excess repetition.  This expands out a little, reminding me of 'Stir of Echoes' and 'What Lies Beneath', but that's not really that far to go.  (One might suppose this is quite derivative of the latter, but the similar plot developments in each film are insufficiently novel for me to assume that this is the case.)  It's moderately scary at the beginning, but it tends toward overkill, as we see the ghost again and again in a very short timespan. (The opening scene is very good, the best of the movie, which is pretty much always a bad sign.) Then, when  we get to unravelling the mystery the whole things slows down a lot and is quite a bit more low-key, and a lot less tense.  Also the whole tech-horror aspect doesn't really work for me.  Like others, I'm not especially terrified of the telephone.  Frankly, Ringu and The Ring worked in spite of the technological element, rather than because of them.  I find it tough to imagine that I'm the only one who was initially hesitant about those films because they were about cursed videotapes.  But, whatever.If you're a fan of the genre you definitely ought to see this.  It's pretty well done.  But, if you don't feel any particular need to see another girl-ghost movie, there's no strong reason why you should make an exception for this one.Grade: B-",3,"3.5.

872281,A3G602Z4DWDZKS,B0006Q9464,Matthew King,"[10, 13]","Koreans have been big players in the Asian horror boom of the last few years, producing acclaimed genre fare such as ""Ring Virus"", ""A tale of two sisters"" and the sadistic revenge thriller ""Oldboy"" among others.  One of the more successful was the 2002 Korean box office smash ""Phone"" just now released in America through TLA Entertainment Group.  No doubt ""Phone"" owes part of its success to the splash that Ringu made on the international horror scene.  However, knocking off ""Phone"" as a Ringu ripoff would be a mistake.  This is an excellent film in its own right.Ji-Won, a successful journalist, is being stalked.  Her revealing sex-scandal articles have made her quite a few enemies lately including a creep who keeps phoning her cell and following her around so she changes her phone number and accepts her friend's offer of a retreat into a secluded country cabin.  But even with new digs and a new phone number, Ji-Won is still getting creepy calls.  Even worse, she finds out that the last 3 people who were registered under the same phone# have died mysterious deaths...""Phone"" wastes no time getting started.  The initial elevator scene is a real chiller as are the initial stalker calls that Ji-Won receives.  Barely 20 minutes into it and this one is a full-blown creepfest.  The incessant ringing is a clever way to scare the viewer; the first few had me on edge but after a half dozen rings and a bunch of Red Herrings later my nerves were pretty well fried.  At this point, however effective it may be in scaring us, ""Phone"" does feel derivative of Ringu.  But halfway through the movie the plot takes a very interesting turn of events, involving a complex backstory of the events surrounding the birth of creepy kid Yeong-ju and a hidden affair between one of the main characters and a schoolgirl who may or may not be a vengeful ghost, all the while as Ji-Won tries to uncover the mysteries surrounding the deaths of the previous owners of the same phone #. Got all that? I know ""Phone"" seems routine on the surface when you haven't seen the movie, but trust me it is anything but.As in ""Ju-On The Grudge"" these backstories are told in a non-linear style that keeps us wondering what is a dream and what's not?  Is this in the past or in the future?  It's all rather confusing in parts but this is what makes ""Phone"" even better upon repeat viewings.  This is yet another fine addition in the cannon of mind-blowing Asian horror films to come out in recent years.  Oh, one more thing.  Why not just chuck the darn phone  or let it ring? Doesn't make much sense but then again we ARE living in the 21st century.

A couple of friends, figuring she needs to get out of the city for a while, offer to let her stay at their house in the country.

Her demeanor changes after that, and Ji-won, doing what she does best, finds out that everyone who's had the number before her has died an unnatural death. How to save Yung-ju from the same fate?It's certainly not a bad movie, it's just not all the great, either.

872286,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B0006Q9464,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[0, 0]","Like ""Double Vision"", ""Phone"" is an Asian movie that starts out in the suspense thriller vein and evolves into a tremendous horror movie.  With plenty of mystery, drama, enigmatism and genuine frights to appeal to a broad range of movie fans, ""Phone"" was a huge hit in its native South Korea and is entitled to more recognition in the world outside Asia.When an investigative reporter played by Ji-Won Ha begins receiving threatening cell phone calls she assumes it's related to one of the criminal exposes she's written.  But the calls, and the strange happenings with her computer, seem to suugest to the viewer, if not immediately all the characters, that the source of the threats is something stranger.  Before seeing ""Phone"" I'd heard it asked why the character doesn't simply get rid of the single phone that seems to be the main source of the threats, but upon seeing it at least that became clear: by the time it's looking more and more supernatural and less like a flesh-and-blood stalker, the 'threat' (for lack of a better word) has already got its hooks into someone close to Ha's character, and there's an unspoken reluctance to get rid of the conduit.  One of the main things that reveals the mystery to be unearthly in origin is the revelation, fairly early on, that the last several people to have the cell phone number Ji-Won now has, have died.  One in a car accident, one an apparant suicide, and so on.Although the question of why she didn't get rid of the title phone was cleared up, other things remain unexplained.  And not things that Should be left cryptic and open to interpretation; a couple of plot threads are simply dropped with no explanation, as if scenes were cut out of the movie.  If one wants to they can come up with ideas of their own on these fronts, but I thought the movie should have at least given some kind of hints or acknowledgement to the fact that these points were left so open.  If not for this fault, it might have gotten five stars.The production is superb, which seems to be the par for South Korean movies, and the acting exceptional.  See-Woo Eun, a child actress playing a little girl named Yeong-Ju, is especially excellent, on par with Dakota Fanning's performance in ""War Of The Worlds"".  Another thing worth mentioning is the 'jump' factor - if there's one thing Asian horror movies seem to have in common, it's that they certainly don't telegraph their jolts.  With American horror movies excellent the last few years, with Canada actually producing a fairly large number of greats for the first time (not that there haven't been individual horror movies done in Canada that were good before; just not so many of them), with the European output still high in quality, and with the continuing flood of greats from Korea, Hong Kong, Japan, etc. it's a great time to be a horror fan.
