563574,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000051S5M,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[8, 8]","What a surprising beautiful and tragic film that Mike White has created.  I say Mike White instead of the director (who also did an exemplary job) because it was his penmanship that crafted this film into such a powerhouse.  When I rented the film, I did not expect to be so submerged with so many bold styles and emotional thematic elements.  I was not expecting to see such a high caliber of acting and storytelling mixed together into one small Sundance winning picture.  In other words, I wasn't expecting really anything when I placed this film into my DVD player, so when the film finished and I picked my jaw off the floor, it became instantly clear that I would never experience another film like this one again.  From the way that it was filmed, to the small budget of the production, to even the taboo subject it presented, Chuck & Buck is one of those films that will shock, amaze, and really pull at the strings of your heart.  It is a film, first and foremost, about friendship and the destructive impact that childhood moments can have on our futures.I cannot speak of this film without mentioning first the brilliant mind of Mike White.  Not only did he accomplish the first challenge of this film ... writing it, but he also stole the entire film by also playing one of the leads, Buck.  While most film watchers, sadly, will remember him as Jack Black's friend in School of Rock, his true talents are completely showcased in this film.  He completely looses himself in this character and it is absolutely obvious to those of us watching the film.  During all of this film, I never once saw Mike White, the actor, but instead I saw the character of Buck.  That is a rare accomplishment in the acting world.  Nine times out of ten in these types of films, you are handed moments where the actor or actress is simply themselves with a different type of voice.  That is not the case with Mike White, he completely embodies his character.  From the hand motions, voice, and even reactions, he is Buck.  He is the character he has set out to play.  This can happen because you can tell he is very compelled to this character.  He is not into the story for the money, but instead to tell the story as honestly as possible.  This was very obvious throughout the film.  These actors, now directors and writers, placed their heart and soul into this picture, and it seeped through the television.  This is truly one of those rare instances where you could see why people decide to make films.While I wasn't overly impressed with the acting ability of Chris Weitz (since Mike White overshadowed him), he did help contribute to the overall scheme of the story.  This is a thrilling tale, and it is difficult to see it as the comedy that IMDb has labeled.  This was a completely human story told with such precise honesty and honor that I have no doubts that anyone that watches it will walk away with a different perspective.  This wasn't your typical ""stalker"" film, there were so many different and deep layers to this story that you could easily watch it three or four times a day and still get caught up in a different aspect.  I don't know if this makes sense or not, but there were moments when I could see the friendship, the insanity, and the sorrow.  The ending brought the story full circle and really had me in suspense until the final moments.  Nothing is handed to you right away, as the story develops, you are shown more and more until the utter power of this film is hanging on your own shoulders.  It is deep and amazing, and I cannot stop using that word ""amazing"" enough.Overall, I thought this was an exceptional film for 2000.  I think that White should have been handed more and more acting roles throughout the years, but it still makes me happy to see him writing.  This was a film about friends who never quite left their childhood years, and have been waiting for that one moment to close the door of to their past.  This is not a film for everyone, but if chosen to explore will reveal some thickly layered characters with superb acting by Mr. White.  This is a drama that carries relevance in today's society and will continue forever to be a cultural staple in the film world.  I loved it, and hope others will see the powerful nature of Chuck & Buck.Grade: **** out of *****",4,"What do you do in L.A., Buck?",1110326400,"03 9, 2005",2005,4309,"['What', 'surprising', 'beautiful', 'tragic', 'film', 'Mike', 'White', 'created', 'say', 'Mike', 'White', 'instead', 'director', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'exemplary', 'job', 'was', 'penmanship', 'crafted', 'film', 'powerhouse', 'When', 'rented', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'be', 'so', 'submerged', 'so', 'many', 'bold', 'styles', 'emotional', 'thematic', 'elements', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'see', 'such', 'high', 'caliber', 'acting', 'storytelling', 'mixed', 'together', 'one', 'small', 'Sundance', 'winning', 'picture', 'other', 'words', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'really', 'anything', 'when', 'placed', 'film', 'DVD', 'player', 'so', 'when', 'film', 'finished', 'picked', 'jaw', 'floor', 'became', 'instantly', 'clear', 'would', 'never', 'experience', 'film', 'one', 'again', 'way', 'was', 'filmed', 'small', 'budget', 'production', 'even', 'taboo', 'subject', 'presented', 'Chuck', 'Buck', 'one', 'films', 'will', 'shock', 'amaze', 'really', 'pull', 'strings', 'heart', 'film', 'first', 'foremost', 'friendship', 'destructive', 'impact', 'childhood', 'moments', 'can', 'have', 'futures.I', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'film', 'mentioning', 'first', 'brilliant', 'mind', 'Mike', 'White', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'accomplish', 'first', 'challenge', 'film', 'writing', 'also', 'stole', 'entire', 'film', 'also', 'playing', 'one', 'leads', 'Buck', 'most', 'film', 'watchers', 'sadly', 'will', 'remember', 'Jack', 'Black', 'friend', 'School', 'Rock', 'true', 'talents', 'are', 'completely', 'showcased', 'film', 'completely', 'character', 'absolutely', 'obvious', 'watching', 'film', 'film', 'never', 'once', 'saw', 'Mike', 'White', 'actor', 'instead', 'saw', 'character', 'Buck', 'rare', 'accomplishment', 'acting', 'world', 'Nine', 'ten', 'types', 'films', 'are', 'handed', 'moments', 'where', 'actor', 'actress', 'simply', 'different', 'type', 'voice', 'not', 'case', 'Mike', 'White', 'completely', 'character', 'hand', 'motions', 'voice', 'even', 'reactions', 'Buck', 'character', 'set', 'out', 'play', 'can', 'happen', 'can', 'tell', 'very', 'compelled', 'character', 'not', 'story', 'money', 'instead', 'tell', 'story', 'as', 'honestly', 'possible', 'was', 'very', 'obvious', 'film', 'actors', 'now', 'directors', 'writers', 'placed', 'heart', 'soul', 'picture', 'seeped', 'television', 'truly', 'one', 'rare', 'instances', 'where', 'could', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'decide', 'make', 'films.While', 'was', ""n't"", 'overly', 'impressed', 'acting', 'ability', 'Chris', 'Weitz', 'Mike', 'White', 'overshadowed', 'did', 'help', 'contribute', 'overall', 'scheme', 'story', 'thrilling', 'tale', 'difficult', 'see', 'comedy', 'IMDb', 'labeled', 'was', 'completely', 'human', 'story', 'told', 'such', 'precise', 'honesty', 'honor', 'have', 'doubts', 'anyone', 'will', 'walk', 'away', 'different', 'perspective', 'was', ""n't"", 'typical', 'stalker', 'film', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'deep', 'layers', 'story', 'could', 'easily', 'watch', 'three', 'four', 'times', 'day', 'still', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'different', 'aspect', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'sense', 'not', 'were', 'moments', 'when', 'could', 'see', 'friendship', 'insanity', 'sorrow', 'ending', 'brought', 'story', 'full', 'circle', 'really', 'had', 'suspense', 'final', 'moments', 'Nothing', 'handed', 'right', 'away', 'story', 'are', 'shown', 'more', 'more', 'utter', 'power', 'film', 'hanging', 'own', 'shoulders', 'deep', 'amazing', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'using', 'word', 'amazing', 'enough.Overall', 'thought', 'was', 'exceptional', 'film', '2000', 'think', 'White', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'handed', 'more', 'more', 'acting', 'roles', 'years', 'still', 'happy', 'see', 'writing', 'was', 'film', 'friends', 'who', 'never', 'quite', 'left', 'childhood', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'one', 'moment', 'close', 'door', 'past', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'chosen', 'explore', 'will', 'reveal', 'thickly', 'layered', 'characters', 'superb', 'acting', 'Mr.', 'White', 'drama', 'relevance', 'today', 'society', 'will', 'continue', 'forever', 'be', 'cultural', 'staple', 'film', 'world', 'loved', 'hope', 'others', 'will', 'see', 'powerful', 'nature', 'Chuck', 'Buck.Grade', '****', '*****']",Chuck & Buck
563575,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B000051S5M,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[1, 4]","This film just won an Independent Spirit Award in its category of being made for under $500,000.  You could never tell that this movie was made for that little money.  One big thing it has going for it is that the lead people in it are all talented screenwriters so that this film does not lack for a well written script.  This in itself is refreshing.  I think I could make it to 5 stars despite its being unsettling and weird.  The creativity of it more than makes up for that.  The fact that Chuck and Buck were sexually active with one another as children and now Chuck is marrying a woman is all right too.  The single hardest thing, however, that I had trouble getting beyond was that the screenwriter-actor who plays Buck is so physically unattractive (whether this is true in reality or deliberately done for the film I do not know).  That the personality Buck  portrays in this film is even less attractive further sinks that 5th star for me. My biggest question is not whether Chuck is still bixesual but why Chuck would ever want to be sexually active with Buck at any time.  Chuck is immensely attractive, lives in LA, is rich, successful and more than a little arrogant.  Why does Chuck even show up at Buck's mother's funeral?  It seems as if he could have easily taken a pass. And he is not the kind of guy that puts himself out for anyone, which is made perfectly clear by his recording industry executive career with many women coworkers ready and willing to lie for him to Buck. For awhile I was worried this was going to turn into a mad slasher film but it does not.  It is solely about Buck's fixation on Chuck as the man who will make him right again, as if he were ever ok in the first place.  If a really drop dead gorgeous guy stuck in his childhood obsessions and fixated on the Chuck from his past had played this part, it could have well been 5 stars.",4,"Weird, Unsettling yet Fresh, Original",988502400,"04 29, 2001",2001,1878,"['film', 'just', 'won', 'Independent', 'Spirit', 'Award', 'category', 'being', 'made', '500,000', 'could', 'never', 'tell', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'little', 'money', 'One', 'big', 'thing', 'going', 'lead', 'people', 'are', 'talented', 'screenwriters', 'so', 'film', 'not', 'lack', 'well', 'written', 'script', 'refreshing', 'think', 'could', 'make', '5', 'stars', 'being', 'unsettling', 'weird', 'creativity', 'more', 'up', 'fact', 'Chuck', 'Buck', 'were', 'sexually', 'active', 'one', 'children', 'now', 'Chuck', 'marrying', 'woman', 'right', 'too', 'single', 'hardest', 'thing', 'however', 'had', 'trouble', 'getting', 'was', 'screenwriter-actor', 'who', 'Buck', 'so', 'physically', 'unattractive', 'true', 'reality', 'deliberately', 'done', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'personality', 'Buck', 'film', 'even', 'less', 'attractive', 'further', 'sinks', '5th', 'star', 'biggest', 'question', 'not', 'Chuck', 'still', 'bixesual', 'why', 'Chuck', 'would', 'ever', 'want', 'be', 'sexually', 'active', 'Buck', 'time', 'Chuck', 'immensely', 'attractive', 'LA', 'rich', 'successful', 'more', 'little', 'arrogant', 'Why', 'Chuck', 'even', 'show', 'up', 'Buck', 'mother', 'funeral', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'taken', 'pass', 'not', 'kind', 'guy', 'out', 'anyone', 'made', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'recording', 'industry', 'executive', 'career', 'many', 'women', 'coworkers', 'ready', 'willing', 'lie', 'Buck', 'awhile', 'was', 'worried', 'was', 'going', 'turn', 'mad', 'slasher', 'film', 'not', 'solely', 'Buck', 'fixation', 'Chuck', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'make', 'right', 'again', 'were', 'ever', 'ok', 'first', 'place', 'really', 'drop', 'dead', 'gorgeous', 'guy', 'stuck', 'childhood', 'obsessions', 'fixated', 'Chuck', 'past', 'had', 'played', 'part', 'could', 'have', 'well', 'been', '5', 'stars']",Chuck & Buck
563576,ARO119CO4HZH5,B000051S5M,"Colin Paterson ""b-lever""","[3, 3]","From the moment the theme song, ""Freedom of the Heart"" (the ""oodley, oodley, oodley"" song) was played on the soundtrack over the opening titles, this film had me hooked.No time was wasted getting us right into the story.And for all the bizarreness showcased here, the acting -- indeed, the whole production -- is generally superb.You will never see anything like Mike White -- as Buck -- in another movie. He plays this character with simple goofy honesty, doesn't round off the odd corners, and avoids the stupid ""actorliness"" which most Hollywood performers would bring to similar roles -- think Billy Bob Thornton in ""Sling Blade"", Tom Hanks in ""Forrest Gump"", etc.The rest of the cast is consistently superb. Especially Lupe Ontiveros. She brings to her role a sensibility that is sadly missing from the work of many actors. She's not trying desperately to entertain us. She's just doing her job. And, sure enough, we're entertained. Amazing how that happens.The casting of brothers Chris Weitz (as Charlie ""Chuck"" Sitter) and Paul Weitz (as Sam, (...) untalented, (...) with very grandiose illusions about his possibilities as an actor) is a wonderful touch. The characters need to be physically similar since Sam is selected to act the ""Chuck"" part in a play Buck scripts -- but these guys are terrific. Where Chris Weitz is all restrained cool and control, Paul Weitz hits the mark in every one of his scenes portraying Sam as (...) unabashed(,) he is without making the character into a caricature.There are so many fine moments in this film. Director Miguel Arteta and company did a great job.You get the feeling they made a genuine attempt to understand the story they were filming. That shouldn't be the sign of an exceptional film...but sadly it is these days.""Chuck and Buck"" (...)displays an astonishing amount of heart, compassion, and psychological savvy.Sure, if you were relating the plot to someone, they might stop you and say, ""What? Are you kidding me? Who would want to see a creepy film like that?"" But they'd be wrong.This film portrays the creeps -- and all of the characters -- as human beings.

563583,ATZ1LTONGHOP6,B000051S5M,Genevieve Hayes,"[0, 0]","Following the death of his mother, Buck (Mike White), an extremely immature 27 year old, moves to L.A. in order to reestablish the friendship he had with his childhood best friend Chuck (Chris Weitz). However, when it turns out that Chuck has moved on with his life and doesn't want anything to do with Buck anymore, Buck essentially becomes a stalker in his effort to win back Chuck from Chuck's ""evil"" girlfriend.""Chuck and Buck"" is yet another one of those weird, slightly-off movies that will either fascinate or disgust, much like ""Happiness"" and ""Spanking the Monkey"". I, personally, enjoy films of this type and enjoyed ""Chuck and Buck"". Mike White, who also wrote the script, is perfect as the weirdo Buck, and he did a good job of writing a script that makes you feel for both of the main characters. Neither character is ""evil"" or trying to hurt the other. They are just behaving like two human beings who both have a different take on events that happened 16 years ago, which is what makes this film fascinating...up to a point. The fact that Chuck and Buck do, deep down, care for one another, means that the film's third act is a bit of an anti-climax. I guess that I was sort of hoping that the film would end with an over-the-top ""Fatal Attraction""-esque showdown between Chuck and Buck. It doesn't. In fact, the film loses focus at the very end, making me wonder whether Mike White was having trouble thinking up an ending. Nevertheless, until the final 15 minutes, this is a very food film (if you're into this sort of thing).After making ""Chuck and Buck"", writer/actor Mike White and director Miguel Artera went on to make ""The Good Girl"". Unlike ""Chuck and Buck"", this film does manage to hold up until the end, and is, in fact, one of my favourite films. If you like ""Chuck and Buck"", I recommend watching ""The Good Girl"" as well.",3,If only Buck wanted to hurt someone...,1228521600,"12 6, 2008",2008,1850,"['Following', 'death', 'mother', 'Buck', 'Mike', 'White', 'extremely', 'immature', '27', 'year', 'old', 'L.A.', 'order', 'reestablish', 'friendship', 'had', 'childhood', 'best', 'friend', 'Chuck', 'Chris', 'Weitz', 'However', 'when', 'out', 'Chuck', 'moved', 'life', ""n't"", 'want', 'anything', 'do', 'Buck', 'anymore', 'Buck', 'essentially', 'stalker', 'effort', 'win', 'back', 'Chuck', 'Chuck', 'evil', 'girlfriend', 'Chuck', 'Buck', 'yet', 'one', 'weird', 'slightly-off', 'movies', 'will', 'either', 'fascinate', 'disgust', 'much', 'Happiness', 'Spanking', 'Monkey', 'personally', 'enjoy', 'films', 'type', 'enjoyed', 'Chuck', 'Buck', 'Mike', 'White', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'script', 'perfect', 'weirdo', 'Buck', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'writing', 'script', 'feel', 'main', 'characters', 'character', 'evil', 'trying', 'hurt', 'other', 'are', 'just', 'behaving', 'two', 'human', 'beings', 'who', 'have', 'different', 'take', 'events', 'happened', '16', 'years', 'ago', 'what', 'film', 'fascinating', 'up', 'point', 'fact', 'Chuck', 'Buck', 'do', 'deep', 'down', 'care', 'one', 'film', 'third', 'act', 'bit', 'anti-climax', 'guess', 'was', 'sort', 'hoping', 'film', 'would', 'end', 'over-the-top', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'showdown', 'Chuck', 'Buck', ""n't"", 'fact', 'film', 'focus', 'very', 'end', 'making', 'wonder', 'Mike', 'White', 'was', 'having', 'trouble', 'thinking', 'up', 'ending', 'Nevertheless', 'final', '15', 'minutes', 'very', 'food', 'film', ""'re"", 'sort', 'thing', '.After', 'making', 'Chuck', 'Buck', 'writer/actor', 'Mike', 'White', 'director', 'Miguel', 'Artera', 'went', 'make', 'Good', 'Girl', 'Chuck', 'Buck', 'film', 'manage', 'hold', 'up', 'end', 'fact', 'one', 'favourite', 'films', 'like', 'Chuck', 'Buck', 'recommend', 'watching', 'Good', 'Girl', 'as', 'well']",Chuck & Buck
563584,AV30MMFR2OG90,B000051S5M,"Harley Quinn ""Broken Halo""","[0, 0]","Like everyone else I thought I was going to see a comedy. However, I still saw the potential for a really good film. Buck is 27 with the mentality of an 11 yr old, he literally has toys and lollipops all over his bedroom. His mom has been his caretaker and sole link to the outside world. So when she dies he latches onto Chuck, an old childhood friend who apparently is the only other person that he has ever had a relationship with. When they were 11 Chuck and Buck used to play &#34;games&#34; which were really their way of sexual experimenting as kids. He begins to stalk Chuck and his fiancee and his behavior becomes increasingly disturbing.Understandably Chuck wants nothing to do with Buck. He's basically the socially awkward version of Glen Close's character in Fatal Attraction. In addition, Chuck seems to consider what they did as kids as nothing but sexual experimentation and has moved on with his life. But Buck is obviously obsessed with Chuck.The plot definitely had my interest but it was it's execution that ruined everything. The movie is from the point of view of Buck who I initially felt sympathy for. However it is apparent as the movie goes on that although he has childlike qualities Buck is anything but innocent. He is calculating and dangerous. Because of his childlike qualities people in the film make increasingly dumb decisions in reaction to Buck's behavior because they think he is harmless. Chuck 's wife was a virtual saint. After everything Buck did she has a sit down with him and informs him she knows about what Chuck and Buck did as children and it's something alot of kids do. But seeing as his behavior has become obsessive she gives him the number of a doctor. Personally, I would have gotten a restraining order.What ultimately ruined the movie for me was the ending and the messages it sent. In the climax of the film Buck shows himself for the sexual predator he really is. He follows Chuck to a bar and tells him he will leave him alone forever but only if Chuck spends the night with him. Since he has had a few drinks Chuck agrees. When Buck kisses Chuck he appears to like it, even though he has spent the entire film trying to avoid Buck. In the final scene Buck is at Chuck 's wedding happily eating cake.If I were a gay man I would be offended by the themes in this movie. Basically if you stalk someone long enough they will eventually give in because no doesn't really mean no, it just means not yet. If that fails you can threaten them so they will have sex with you and who knows they might enjoy it or at least pretend to enjoy it because they are scared of you. In the end Buck is rewarded for all of his psychopathic behavior. Ridiculous. The other thing that was out of left field is Chuck is portrayed as straight the whole movie, but at the end it hints he may have been suppressing homosexual feelings this entire time, all he needed was the threat of unending harassmemt by psycho Chuck to find his true self.In alot of movies sexuality is solely black and white, the characters are either gay or straight. What's wrong with having a straight male character who is comfortable enough in his sexuality to admit to having experimented as an adolescent? I thought that was the direction they were going to go in because the wife acknowledged it and was so supportive and sympathetic. It seems like most movies (even artsy fartsy Indies like this one) want to put everyone in a box with a label on it. I was really disappointed in this movie.",2,I really wanted to like it (spoilers),1395187200,"03 19, 2014",2014,3507,"['everyone', 'else', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'see', 'comedy', 'However', 'still', 'saw', 'potential', 'really', 'good', 'film', 'Buck', '27', 'mentality', '11', 'yr', 'old', 'literally', 'toys', 'bedroom', 'mom', 'been', 'caretaker', 'sole', 'link', 'outside', 'world', 'So', 'when', 'Chuck', 'old', 'childhood', 'friend', 'who', 'apparently', 'only', 'other', 'person', 'ever', 'had', 'relationship', 'When', 'were', '11', 'Chuck', 'Buck', 'used', 'play', '34', 'games', '34', 'were', 'really', 'way', 'sexual', 'experimenting', 'kids', 'stalk', 'Chuck', 'fiancee', 'behavior', 'increasingly', 'disturbing.Understandably', 'Chuck', 'nothing', 'do', 'Buck', 'basically', 'socially', 'awkward', 'version', 'Glen', 'Close', 'character', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'addition', 'Chuck', 'consider', 'what', 'did', 'as', 'kids', 'nothing', 'sexual', 'experimentation', 'moved', 'life', 'Buck', 'obviously', 'obsessed', 'Chuck.The', 'plot', 'definitely', 'had', 'interest', 'was', 'execution', 'ruined', 'everything', 'movie', 'point', 'view', 'Buck', 'who', 'initially', 'felt', 'sympathy', 'However', 'apparent', 'movie', 'childlike', 'qualities', 'Buck', 'anything', 'innocent', 'calculating', 'dangerous', 'childlike', 'qualities', 'people', 'film', 'make', 'increasingly', 'dumb', 'decisions', 'reaction', 'Buck', 'behavior', 'think', 'harmless', 'Chuck', 'wife', 'was', 'virtual', 'saint', 'everything', 'Buck', 'did', 'sit', 'down', 'informs', 'what', 'Chuck', 'Buck', 'did', 'children', 'something', 'alot', 'kids', 'do', 'seeing', 'behavior', 'become', 'obsessive', 'number', 'doctor', 'Personally', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'restraining', 'order.What', 'ultimately', 'ruined', 'movie', 'was', 'ending', 'messages', 'sent', 'climax', 'film', 'Buck', 'sexual', 'predator', 'really', 'Chuck', 'bar', 'will', 'leave', 'alone', 'forever', 'only', 'Chuck', 'night', 'had', 'few', 'drinks', 'Chuck', 'When', 'Buck', 'Chuck', 'like', 'even', 'spent', 'entire', 'film', 'trying', 'avoid', 'Buck', 'final', 'scene', 'Buck', 'Chuck', 'wedding', 'happily', 'eating', 'cake.If', 'were', 'gay', 'man', 'would', 'be', 'offended', 'themes', 'movie', 'Basically', 'stalk', 'someone', 'long', 'enough', 'will', 'eventually', 'give', ""n't"", 'really', 'mean', 'just', 'not', 'yet', 'can', 'threaten', 'so', 'will', 'have', 'sex', 'who', 'might', 'enjoy', 'least', 'pretend', 'enjoy', 'are', 'scared', 'end', 'Buck', 'rewarded', 'psychopathic', 'behavior', 'Ridiculous', 'other', 'thing', 'was', 'left', 'field', 'Chuck', 'portrayed', 'straight', 'whole', 'movie', 'end', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'suppressing', 'homosexual', 'feelings', 'entire', 'time', 'all', 'needed', 'was', 'threat', 'unending', 'harassmemt', 'psycho', 'Chuck', 'find', 'true', 'self.In', 'alot', 'movies', 'sexuality', 'solely', 'black', 'white', 'characters', 'are', 'gay', 'straight', 'What', 'wrong', 'having', 'straight', 'male', 'character', 'who', 'comfortable', 'enough', 'sexuality', 'admit', 'having', 'experimented', 'adolescent', 'thought', 'was', 'direction', 'were', 'going', 'go', 'wife', 'acknowledged', 'was', 'so', 'supportive', 'sympathetic', 'most', 'movies', 'even', 'artsy', 'fartsy', 'Indies', 'one', 'want', 'put', 'everyone', 'box', 'label', 'was', 'really', 'disappointed', 'movie']",Chuck & Buck

Clearly mentally disturbed Buck eventually becomes Chuck's stalker.The only flaw in the movie -- besides a sometime wooden cast of extras -- is that it's hard to believe that Chuck wouldn't just fully tell Buck off or explain how messed up he is to his (Chuck's) girlfriend.All in all, CHUCK &amp; BUCK is a surprising hit that -- if you watch it in the dark -- will have you looking over your shoulder.",4,Disturbingly hilarious,983923200,"03 7, 2001",2001,1165,"['can', 'understand', 'why', 'lot', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'very', 'black', 'comedy', 'often', 'hard', 'laugh', 'hard', 'swallow', 'have', 'open', 'mind', 'movies', 'are', 'daring', 'subject', 'matter', 'offbeat', 'then', 'CHUCK', 'amp', 'BUCK', 'good', 'one', 'Chuck', 'Buck', 'were', 'boyhood', 'friends', 'Chuck', 'grew', 'up', 'Buck', 'remained', 'emotional', 'level', 'care-free', 'momma', 'boy', 'when', 'Buck', 'mom', 'dies', 'search', 'old', 'friend.The', 'strongest', 'part', 'movie', 'Mike', 'White', 'flawless', 'overlooked', 'Academy', 'performance', 'Buck', 'Fully', 'character', 'Buck', 'creepy', 'freaky', 'downright', 'hysterical', 'inabiltiy', 'fit', 'act', 'clear-headed', 'adult', 'need', 'reconnect', 'Buck', 'reminiscing', 'jawdropping', 'Clearly', 'mentally', 'disturbed', 'Buck', 'eventually', 'Chuck', 'stalker.The', 'only', 'flaw', 'movie', 'sometime', 'wooden', 'cast', 'extras', 'hard', 'believe', 'Chuck', 'would', ""n't"", 'just', 'fully', 'tell', 'Buck', 'off', 'explain', 'how', 'messed', 'up', 'Chuck', 'girlfriend.All', 'CHUCK', 'amp', 'BUCK', 'surprising', 'hit', 'watch', 'dark', 'will', 'have', 'looking', 'shoulder']",Chuck & Buck
563586,A30R6HEYBNOJX8,B000051S5M,J. Edkin,"[6, 12]","I don't know how or why this movie keeps being classified as a comedy.  Other than a few humorous lines, I don't find it particularly funny.  I don't find it particularly enjoyable either.The plot centers around Chuck (Chris Weitz), a man in his late 20s who has never really grown up.  He responds to the world like a 12 year old.  I don't think he's intended to be mentally challenged.  It's played more as a case of arrested development.  When his mother dies, he reaches out to the one other person in the world to whom he can relate, his best friend Buck (scriptwriter Mike White).  Chuck and Buck were inseparable as kids, but since high school, Buck has moved on.  He now works for a recording agency in L.A.  Chuck (who seems to have money, but I'm not sure where or how.  He doesn't appear to have a job.  His mother was sick for years, so she wasn't working.  So where the money came from, I don't know) moves to L.A. to be closer to Buck and to resume their friendship.  He pretty much becomes a stalker.  It's not funny.Okay, so when they were kids, Chuck and Buck had a sexual relationship at Buck's instigation.  The movie is not clear as to whether or not this is the root of Chuck's arrested development.  Chuck has never gotten over that relationship.  Buck is engaged to be married to a woman, the relationship with Chuck having been nothing more than kids' stuff in his mind.  There is terrific material for a moving and powerful movie here, but Mike White as a writer doesn't rise to the occasion.  He seems to go out of his way to avoid dealing with the issue of Buck's possible responsibility for the man Chuck has become (or never become).And that is the root of my problem with this movie.  There is no authorial or directorial point of view on these characters.  I have no idea what the creators want us to think or feel about them.  Personally, I find myself not liking any of them.  It's not necessary to like any or all of the characters in a movie in order to enjoy it (think ""Citizen Kane""), but there has to be some connection made between the characters and the audience.  I found myself curious about the ramifications of Buck and Chuck's childhood relationship, but as the creators never deal with it, there was nothing to hold the movie together in my mind.  Stuff happens and then it ends--there's no real story in the traditional sense.The movie was shot with digital cameras and looks it.  The lighting changes from shot to shot and because of the use of real locations, there are many sequences that look incredibly claustrophobic because there was little room on the location for the actors, camera, and crew.  The DVD is not letterboxed.  The commentary from Mike White and director Miguel Artega does not offer any insight into what they were trying to say or accomplish with the characters.  There are plenty of other extras on the DVD, but I have not explored them as the movie (after three viewings) has failed to inspire me enough to dig any deeper.  This is a DVD that I have every intention of culling from my collection.A movie of similar interest (and impact):  ""Ghost World""",1,"Many Things, but NOT a Comedy",1014163200,"02 20, 2002",2002,3125,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'why', 'movie', 'being', 'classified', 'comedy', 'Other', 'few', 'humorous', 'lines', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'particularly', 'funny', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'particularly', 'enjoyable', 'either.The', 'plot', 'centers', 'Chuck', 'Chris', 'Weitz', 'man', 'late', '20s', 'who', 'never', 'really', 'grown', 'up', 'world', '12', 'year', 'old', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'intended', 'be', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'played', 'more', 'case', 'arrested', 'development', 'When', 'mother', 'dies', 'out', 'one', 'other', 'person', 'world', 'whom', 'can', 'relate', 'best', 'friend', 'Buck', 'scriptwriter', 'Mike', 'White', 'Chuck', 'Buck', 'were', 'inseparable', 'kids', 'high', 'school', 'Buck', 'moved', 'now', 'recording', 'agency', 'L.A.', 'Chuck', 'who', 'have', 'money', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'where', 'how', ""n't"", 'appear', 'have', 'job', 'mother', 'was', 'sick', 'years', 'was', ""n't"", 'working', 'So', 'where', 'money', 'came', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'moves', 'L.A.', 'be', 'closer', 'Buck', 'resume', 'friendship', 'pretty', 'much', 'stalker', 'not', 'funny.Okay', 'so', 'when', 'were', 'kids', 'Chuck', 'Buck', 'had', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'Buck', 'instigation', 'movie', 'not', 'clear', 'not', 'root', 'Chuck', 'arrested', 'development', 'Chuck', 'never', 'gotten', 'over', 'relationship', 'Buck', 'engaged', 'be', 'married', 'woman', 'relationship', 'Chuck', 'having', 'been', 'nothing', 'more', 'kids', 'stuff', 'mind', 'terrific', 'material', 'moving', 'powerful', 'movie', 'here', 'Mike', 'White', 'writer', ""n't"", 'rise', 'occasion', 'go', 'way', 'avoid', 'dealing', 'issue', 'Buck', 'possible', 'responsibility', 'man', 'Chuck', 'become', 'never', 'become', '.And', 'root', 'problem', 'movie', 'authorial', 'directorial', 'point', 'view', 'characters', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'creators', 'want', 'think', 'feel', 'Personally', 'find', 'not', 'liking', 'not', 'necessary', 'like', 'characters', 'movie', 'order', 'enjoy', 'think', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'there', 'be', 'connection', 'made', 'characters', 'audience', 'found', 'curious', 'ramifications', 'Buck', 'Chuck', 'childhood', 'relationship', 'creators', 'never', 'deal', 'was', 'nothing', 'hold', 'movie', 'together', 'mind', 'Stuff', 'then', 'real', 'story', 'traditional', 'sense.The', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'digital', 'cameras', 'lighting', 'changes', 'shot', 'shot', 'use', 'real', 'locations', 'are', 'many', 'sequences', 'look', 'incredibly', 'claustrophobic', 'was', 'little', 'room', 'location', 'actors', 'camera', 'crew', 'DVD', 'not', 'letterboxed', 'commentary', 'Mike', 'White', 'director', 'Miguel', 'Artega', 'not', 'offer', 'insight', 'what', 'were', 'trying', 'say', 'accomplish', 'characters', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'extras', 'DVD', 'have', 'not', 'explored', 'movie', 'three', 'viewings', 'failed', 'inspire', 'enough', 'dig', 'deeper', 'DVD', 'have', 'intention', 'culling', 'collection.A', 'movie', 'similar', 'interest', 'impact', 'Ghost', 'World']",Chuck & Buck

563590,A270XXONKJ2BAU,B000051S5M,mackjay,"[6, 7]","This cleverly conceived film could be called a new twist on the theme of obsessive love, yet that would not really do it justice. ""Chuck and Buck"" explores the classic tale of unrequited longing not only from a new angle, but attempts to sound the very depths of that longing.Directed with great assurance by Miguel Arteta and written by Mike White (who also plays Buck), this is a film that really succeeds in taking an audience somewhere they have (probably) never been. Nearly everyone can relate to a tale of frustrated love. Buck's monomaniacal fixation of his love object is nothing new to movies. This character could recall John Heard in ""Chilly Scenes of Winter"" or Isabelle Adjani in ""The Story of Adele H."". And, like those and myriad other lovesick character studies, ""Chuck and Buck"" offers the viewer some basis of the obsession. Where the newer film is unique is in the extremely close observation of a lovestruck character as a manchild. Buck has-in the deepest emotional sense-truly never left his childhood behind. His bedroom is replete with every little-boy accessory: piles of boxed board games, stuffed animals, and the persistent motif, an illuminated plastic globe that displays lollypops. When his mother dies at the outset of the film, Buck-now 27-instantly transfers his emotional dependency onto Chuck, his best friend from childhood. Not surprisingly, the latter has moved forward into an adult life. Chuck has gone to LA, taken a job with an independent recording company, and gotten himself engaged. Buck tracks his old friend down, inviting him to his mother's funeral, and wastes no time in letting Chuck know that the special quality of their childhood relationship-a sexual one-has not been forgotten. In fact, Buck wants to take right up where they left off some sixteen years ago. As might be expected, Chuck, his fiancee in tow, heads immediately for the Hollywood Hills. When the indomitable Buck relocates himself to LA to pursue his romantic destiny, the two men embark upon one of the oddest and most wrenching psychodramas yet encountered on screen.Among many notable aspects of the film is its completely unapologetic attitude to homosexuality. Buck certainly has a problem, but it is one of infantilism, not of sexual orientation. Even in moments of dire frustration at Buck's relentless advances, Chuck never condemns his friend for who he is. For some, an identification of homosexuality with infantilism may be seen as a subtext here. But to this reviewer, the sexuality issue serves a more symbolic end: these childhood friends whose names rhyme are two sides of one coin. They have more in common than Chuck, perhaps, would admit and their bond goes deeper than even Buck could know.Chris Weitz does good work bringing an exasperated Chuck to life. Although his character is much less finely drawn, Chuck can elicit as much audience-identification as Buck does. Weitz' facial expressions, as realizations slowly dawn upon him are expert and compelling. In the role of a neighborhood theater guardian angel, Lupe Ontiveros is a marvel. She finds the exact key to a character who discovers herself through association with the enigmatic Buck. Best of all is Mike White as Buck, a textbook case of perfect casting. White could not look more suited to the role: his slightly drooping, half-open mouth and shock of red hair are both comic and oddly endearing. So identified with is White with Buck that it is difficult to avoid thinking the role is somewhat autobiographical.In a film of many fascinating and clever touches, one especially stands out. Running out of avenues to Chuck, Buck decides to write and produce a play about his frustrating friendship. With the help of the Ontiveros character and some hilarious backstage tribulations, the play is performed and, as a conciliatory gesture, attended by Chuck. The upshot of this entertaining, but disturbing episode is unexpected and moving.Shot on digital video tape by Chuy Chavez, the film has a fuzzy, home-movie quality. And the many hand-held shots have only a slight documentary feeling, due to the complete lack of any sense of improvisation in this tightly scripted venture. ""Chuck and Buck"" takes chances with it characters and its narrative. While some of its components may work better than others, it boldly questions the meaning of emotional maturity and friendship.

You won't leave the theatre (or turn off the VCR/DVD player) humming a happy tune, content that the world is in good hands.  It aims to disturb.  Someone once said that the difference between mainstream and independent cinema is that mainstream cinema will confirm all your belief systems.  &quot;Chuck &amp; Buck&quot; is thus emblematic of independent cinema, which seeks to turn your belief systems upside down, challenging them with otherwise unheard of notions that might make you uncomfortable.  Or in this case, creepy.Buck is the main repository of this creepiness.  A 27-year old manchild, Buck has recently lost his mother, and reacquainted himself with childhood friend Chuck.  Buck, as played by Mike White, has horrid teeth, blank eyes, and a wardrobe better suited for a third grader.  Not a man suited for survival in the outside world.  But Buck has a passion that can't be quenched.  That passion is Chuck.Chuck, er, Charles, signs rock bands in Los Angeles.  He has a charmingly social fiancee, Carlin, with whom he lives in a comfortable home.  Charles has done a fine job until now of forgetting his childhood best friend, but once he's caught again in Buck's web, he can't seem to get himself out of it again.  Chris Weitz, who plays Chuck, looks like Tom Cruise after a boxing match with Mike Tyson.  He gets Chuck's exasperation just right, and never dwells too deep into his anger.The rest of the cast is minimal and unremarkable.  Except, of course, for Lupe Ontiveros, who I've only ever seen play &quot;the maid&quot; (check out her filmography; the word is liberally peppered through her list of character names).  Ontiveros neatly pulls off Beverly, house manager turned creative director of a small theatre company.  She is imbued with street wisdom, blind passion, and fine maternal instincts, especially when it comes to guiding Buck.White, who doubles as the film's screenwriter, doesn't rely on flashy or stylish dialogue.  Rather he goes for something much more real.  Buck speaks in a stilted stutter that exposes his lack of intellect and maturity.  Chuck can barely get out two sentences at a time, except when he's schmoozing with record industry types.  The effect this has is that the characters become less like characters and more like real people.  Couple this with the low-rent digital video cinematography, and what you get is a fictional movie that could easily pass for documentary.  Further help with the script may have come from Chris Weitz and his brother Paul, who co-screenwrote the horrible &quot;American Pie&quot; movies.  Paul also has a role here, playing a horribly untalented actor.  Having three screenwriter's in the cast, which might have made the whole endeavor more verbose, actually made things more concise, and contributed to a fine screenplay.  (Alas, a similar compliment could not be paid to &quot;Armageddon&quot;, which had 4 screenwriters in its cast)As for the ending, well, I concur with the general consensus.  Chuck's &quot;choice&quot; comes out of left field, for we don't really know what happened in his childhood.  In hindsight, it appears to make sense once we fill in the gaps ourselves.  Still, it's a bold move for the movie to make, trusting that its already perplexed audience is willing to go down one last road less traveled.  This ending confused me at first, but upon further reflection it made just enough sense to be justified.

What do you get when you have the brothers who directed &quot;American Pie&quot;? What you have is a disturbing piece of art that makes stalking look like an innocent thing. Screenwriter Mike White, who wrote the Sandler movie (Note: The script was considered too &quot;childish&quot;!), wrote this truly bizarre film that doesn't feature CGI, big name stars, or perfect sound. What it does feature, is an insight into the world of someone who never grew up beyond ten and still dabbles in his childhood-like life by hanging up collages of pictures of he and his friends (Collages that you made when you were in kindergarten) and leaves his toys scattered about the room. White plays Buck, a child trapped in a man's body who's just lost his mother, and feels the need to reconnect to Chuck, engaged to a good woman and now an up and coming music executive on the fast track and living in Los Angeles. Buck wants to rekindle those old days he had as kids with Buck including some games of perversion, something Chuck is very intent on forgetting. Disturbing, relentless, and ultra-tragic, &quot;Chuck &amp; Buck&quot; is a film that will screw with your head and will affect you in a way that many films don't. White's Buck is a true original that goes on par with other such movie characters as Peter Sellers in &quot;Being There&quot; by not showcasing Buck, but portraying him as an innocent who can't grow up. The performances are particularly good with Mike White showcasing his talents as an actor, his performance infers that he understood the script as he plays a truly disturbing character.

Films do not necessarily have to be about anything but &quot;Chuck &amp; Buck&quot; seems to desperately want to be about something.  The whole film, with its numerous contrivances, appears to be set up as a parable.  Even the contrivance of the story within the story, &quot;Hank and Frank&quot;, seems to be a purposeful allegory of some sort.  It is apparent that &quot;Chuck &amp; Buck&quot;, by contrasting &quot;normal&quot; Charlie's self-denial of his sexuality with &quot;abnormal&quot; Buck's ingenuous naturalness to his, is ostensibly commenting on how social propriety can bury one's sexual nature.  On the other hand, it is also apparent that &quot;Hank and Frank&quot; is a manifestation of Buck's indictment of Charlie for his &quot;crippled&quot; development, as brought about by Chuck's sexual exploitation of Buck.  Maybe it's me but these two points do not jibe with me -- is it Chuck or Buck who's &quot;crippled&quot; anyway?  And then there's the climactic scene between the two eponymous characters in Buck's apartment.  I don't know but it didn't look to me like Charlie is trying very hard to bury his sexuality, nor is Buck equally diligent at preventing himself from being exploited again.  It also didn't help that Chris Weitz, who played Charlie, is as poker-faced as Lorenzo Lamas.  The muddy digital-video camera work isn't anything to write home about either.

563604,AWY56V0LIB3P,B000051S5M,Stephen McLeod,"[7, 8]","One thing I expect a movie to do is move me in one way or another. What I mean is, even semi-skillful movies make you feel *something.* What a movie makes the viewer feel is directly related to the movie's vision -- its humanity and its perspective on &quot;the human condition.&quot; Sometimes a movie gives the feeling that its &quot;auteurs&quot; don't really have such a perspective, or worse, that if there is one, it's not entirely worked out so that, ultimately, what's left is little more than empty cynicism.I'm not sure how the makers of *Chuck &amp; Buck* feel about our common lot, but quite frankly, this movie gave me the creeps. That's not necessarily a bad thing. It's just a thing you should know before buying it: this movie is not entertaining. It doesn't mean to be, I suspect. It means, I think, to uncover something very unflattering and sad about us, our unwillingness to let go of the dreams (obsessions) that fail us.Leonard Maltin almost never tells you that there is gay subject matter in a movie, so if you don't already know that, there is.  Unfortunately, add this to the long list of movies whose sole view of homosexuality is that it is &quot;defective&quot; and creepy. This is doubly unfortunate in a movie with such liberal pretensions as this one has.  I'm sure that the film-makers would answer that obsession, not homosexuality, is the the focus here.  But that begs the question, because the plot of this movie turns on the emotional distress that a straight man feels who is the object of homosexual obsession.Another thing Leonard Maltin doesn't tell you is that, while this movie tries very hard to be a good movie in a very typically independent and low-budget kind of way, it doesn't quite rise to the occasion. I'm not sorry I saw it, but I don't think that, in the end, this movie is wise enough to reach its moral destination. The denoument, for example, doesn't ring true (I'm talking about the &quot;deal&quot; that Chuck &amp; Buck finally make in hopes of resolving their common problem). The reason for that is unclear, but I think it has to do with the movie's self-conscious ambivalence toward it's characters.Human beings are complicated, and this movie certainly knows that. I liked the film's willingness to be absolutely frank about something that is embarassing precisely because it is so recognizable. I suspect most people have felt the unique humiliation of unrequited infatuation (not love), and the terrible confusion that attends it. What most people don't do is act it out to the extent that Buck does in this movie. And if they do, they generally end up in jail, not eating cake. But, okay, I might have been willing to let that pass.I also very much liked the subtle way that &quot;Chuck&quot; (Charlie) initially reacts -- avoidance -- to a situation that he clearly did not ask for, (though Buck seems to believe that he did). Charlie clearly thinks of himself as, essentially, a &quot;nice&quot; guy. He's got a nice job, a fiance, he takes his morning run. He's handsome, oddly sexy. Chuck has convinced himself that life can be normal and relatively bump-free.)What I didn't like, and didn't believe, was what eventually happens. It strained credibility, but more than that, in its compromise, the movie seemed to have lost its way. The inevitable didn't happen: Buck doesn't wind up in a jail or an asylum.  In movies, that's always a bad thing because it reveals a disturbing distance between a film's makers and their subject.IMHO, movie-makers have to be more responsible than these movie-makers are to some discernable world-view because movies, more than any other art-form in the 20th century, have carved out for themselves, a claim of moral authority.  Whether we like it or not, movies, especially movies that give off an aura of having ""something to say,"" tend inevitably to teach us something about what is wrong and what is right with human beings.  In other words, a movie with ""something to say"" ought to say something, not just seek to make its audience unaccountably uncomfortable.  When a movie fails or stumbles in this regard, it is a moral failure because movies affect us so directly and personally.I didn't know what to make of Buck *or* Chuck at the end of this movie, and I'm not convinced that the filmakers did either.
