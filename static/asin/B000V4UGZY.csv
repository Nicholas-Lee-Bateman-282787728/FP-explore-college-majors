1098501,ADBEG8PLO3OMC,B000V4UGZY,"A. Johnson ""Jason Hex""","[3, 5]","The reasons to avoid this movie are manifold, and have virtually nothing to do with its level of violence. Granted, there's a few nasty special FX on hand, but Captivity is actually rather tame compared with other contenders in the so-called ""torture porn"" genre. Captivity suffers from an identity crisis that begins with the hiring of an eminent director, Roland Joffe, the guy who made The Killing Fields. Obviously Joffe is a world-class talent and understands how to make a genre movie, which he compares to ""a Swiss watch."" He just doesn't understand the grindhouse/exploitation arena, which is the only arena in which a movie like Captivity makes sense. He thinks he is making a psychological thriller with complex insights into human behavior, and that kind of thinking can only derail a project like Captivity. Right or wrong, Hostel/Saw/The Devil's Rejects, et al., relish the irony of our fascination with human suffering as entertainment; Roth directs with one eye to bizarre B movies like Cannibal Holocaust and another that winks at the audience--you like that scene with the blowtorch? Okay, watch this. Yes, it's a twisted sensibility, but we live in twisted times. Roth doesn't pretend he's making Art with a capital ""A""; he's making Commerce with a capital ""C,"" and damn good commerce at that. Bottom line: Despite a story and co-screenwriting credit from low-budget genre god Larry Cohen, despite a fairly original narrative (a Psycho riff, but a good one), and because everybody involved, from the Russian producers to star Eliza Cuthbert, seem to believe they're making an Ingmar Bergmann movie that just happens to feature a girl's face being dissolved with acid, Captivity just doesn't work. It's not even bad enough to qualify as a guilty pleasure. My suggestion is, if you like what this movie appears to promise, watch Hostel Part II instead. And then go back to the true guilty pleasures: Cannibal Ferox, Cannibal Holocaust, The Beyond, Doctor Butcher, M.D., Tenebrae--there's a world of really sweet bad movies out there, well worth the watching where Captivity is not.",1,A Huge Waste of Talent,1202688000,"02 11, 2008",2008,2097,"['reasons', 'avoid', 'movie', 'are', 'manifold', 'have', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'do', 'level', 'violence', 'Granted', 'few', 'nasty', 'special', 'FX', 'hand', 'Captivity', 'actually', 'rather', 'tame', 'compared', 'other', 'contenders', 'so-called', 'torture', 'porn', 'genre', 'Captivity', 'suffers', 'identity', 'crisis', 'hiring', 'eminent', 'director', 'Roland', 'Joffe', 'guy', 'who', 'made', 'Killing', 'Fields', 'Obviously', 'Joffe', 'world-class', 'talent', 'how', 'make', 'genre', 'movie', 'Swiss', 'watch', 'just', ""n't"", 'understand', 'grindhouse/exploitation', 'arena', 'only', 'arena', 'movie', 'Captivity', 'sense', 'making', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'complex', 'insights', 'human', 'behavior', 'kind', 'thinking', 'can', 'only', 'derail', 'project', 'Captivity', 'Right', 'wrong', 'Hostel/Saw/The', 'Devil', 'Rejects', 'et', 'al.', 'relish', 'irony', 'fascination', 'human', 'suffering', 'entertainment', 'Roth', 'one', 'eye', 'bizarre', 'B', 'movies', 'Cannibal', 'Holocaust', 'audience', 'scene', 'blowtorch', 'Okay', 'watch', 'Yes', 'twisted', 'sensibility', 'live', 'twisted', 'times', 'Roth', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'making', 'Art', 'capital', 'A', 'making', 'Commerce', 'capital', 'C', 'damn', 'good', 'commerce', 'Bottom', 'line', 'story', 'co-screenwriting', 'credit', 'low-budget', 'genre', 'god', 'Larry', 'Cohen', 'fairly', 'original', 'narrative', 'Psycho', 'riff', 'good', 'one', 'everybody', 'involved', 'Russian', 'producers', 'star', 'Eliza', 'Cuthbert', 'seem', 'believe', ""'re"", 'making', 'Ingmar', 'Bergmann', 'movie', 'just', 'feature', 'girl', 'face', 'being', 'dissolved', 'acid', 'Captivity', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'not', 'even', 'bad', 'enough', 'qualify', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'suggestion', 'like', 'what', 'movie', 'promise', 'watch', 'Hostel', 'Part', 'II', 'instead', 'then', 'go', 'back', 'true', 'guilty', 'pleasures', 'Cannibal', 'Ferox', 'Cannibal', 'Holocaust', 'Beyond', 'Doctor', 'Butcher', 'M.D.', 'Tenebrae', 'world', 'really', 'sweet', 'bad', 'movies', 'there', 'well', 'watching', 'where', 'Captivity', 'not']",N/A

Whether the blood tasted good or not, well, who knows.Very interesting how every single time the girl tried to escape from the room she was trapped in, there was something carefully designed in the room preventing the girl from making a clean exit.After a while she finds out that the room next to hers has a guy living in it, who supposedly is another victim.  Yeah right...You can't go in expecting a believable story because the odds of a room being set up perfectly for the ultimate torture story is almost impossible.  I mean, come on, it's not possible most of the things that happened in the movie could ever really happen because it would require lots of perfect timing on the part of the victim.

1098505,A8TM0MI3D9T29,B000V4UGZY,Brett Corkins,"[9, 12]","A beautiful model seems to have everything...money, fame, a dog. That changes when she's abducted in the middle of a lively club. She wakes up to find she's in a prison of sorts and subjected to horredous acts. Thus is the plot behind Captivity.Lets be blunt shall we? I bought this because I think Elisha Cuthbert is an amazing talent. Yet somehow, even she couldn't save this film from being sadly predictable with characters as wooden as your dining room table. Jennifer (Elisha's character) has absolutely no backstory, you see her in a photo shoot so you kind of put two and two together to come up with the fact that she's a model. You realize she has a dog that she treats like a human. And, honestly, seems like a genuinely lonely person to me. But it doesn't take more than 15 minutes before she gets taken and the torture begins. With the film moving so swiftly I had no reason to care whether she lived or died.The acting, on everyone's part, was terrible...like Jessica Simpson herself offered up acting tips to everyone involved. I think that's what disappointed me the most. Watch the special features. None of the actors seem particularly enthused about the film. Heck, listen to Elisha, she, and I quote, says ""I did this movie to work with Roland (the director)."" There's no emotion in their voices that tells us the enjoyed making the movie or the outcome whatsoever. You know you're in for a stinker when your actors aren't even happy with the movie.Effects, however, are decent. The acid bath was pretty cool, and seeing someone take a sledgehammer to a person's face will usually get a reaction from me. Past that, the only original torture-esque thing they did was the room that fills up with sand. That, actually, is the only time I felt the terror that should've been coming through the entire film.Overall, even if you're an Elisha Cuthbert fan, such as myself, it might just be best to skip this over. There's nothing here you haven't seen before, and done much better. There's no surprises, even the ending isn't very surprising.

1098511,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000V4UGZY,Chris Pandolfi,"[11, 16]","I'm shocked and appalled that I actually found something redeeming about ""Captivity,"" if only at first. This is an ugly film, parts of which are as sick, depraved, and disgusting as an R rated movie is allowed to be. Of course, I knew all along that it was supposed to be that way, which is probably why that aspect didn't bother me. The first half of the film is actually quite strong, simply because no effort was put into character development, dialogue, or even plot; it was all about shocking the audience with gruesome scenes of torture and gore. It certainly worked in that regard. But then it completely lost its way, first when the characters were fleshed out, second when a back-story was alluded to. Both were beyond ridiculous, downright unnecessary. Had the filmmakers stuck to their original idea, had they not given the film an actual story and just focused on shock value, it probably would have been much more effective.The plot concerns the plight of a young model/actress named Jennifer (Elisha Cuthbert). After drinking a drug-laced martini at a club and blacking out, she awakens to the realization that she's been kidnapped. She finds herself locked in a concrete cellar, a barren, dark room that's rigged with cameras, microphones, and various devices for psychological torture. Jennifer is periodically drugged, and she awakens to find herself in a different room, restrained on a slab. That's usually when we get vague impressions of the torturer, a menacing figure hidden by shadows and dark clothing. Who this person is and what this person wants is initially not revealed, which I thought worked quite well. All we really need to know is that he or she wants to be in complete control. This is probably why Jennifer is forced to witness video footage of previous victims. It's also why she's forced to do terrible things, such as drinking a blended mixture that's best not described.After a while, a second captive is introduced, and the film goes downhill from there. His name is Gary (Daniel Gillies), and he claims to have been there for three days. He and Jennifer initially communicate through a dirt-covered window, although they occasionally find themselves back in the torture chamber, strapped to slabs. They eventually discover that the wall separating their chambers have doors, and that the torturer can open and close them. After they find themselves together, a series of plot twists begin. Not only do they ruin the atmosphere, they also make absolutely no sense. I'm afraid I can't describe them in detail; too much would be given away. In all honesty, the rest of the film can't be described without being incredibly vague. What I can say is that a new subplot is introduced, one that involves a boy who murdered his mother.The last twenty minutes of the film unfold so unoriginally that I left feeling somewhat cheated. The shocking nature of the opening half is disregarded for routine escape scenes, material that had worn itself out a long time ago. It isn't a matter of being implausible; the entire premise is implausible, from the kidnapping to the methods of torture. It is, however, a matter of consistency, of sticking to the idea that initially made the film work. I'm usually one for character development, but in this case, it was not needed. If the intention is to consistently make the audience feel uncomfortable with scenes of torture, then please, don't bother trying to develop the characters. I didn't want to invest in Jennifer, and I certainly didn't want to understand who Gary was. But at a certain point, I was forced to do both, and that completely ruined the experience.I think what's most disappointing is that this isn't the film I was expecting. As you may have heard, its ad campaign caused quite a stir. A four-paneled billboard--featuring the tagline ""Abduction. Confinement. Torture. Extermination""--depicted Cuthbert in a series of disturbing situations that many deemed unsuitable for public display. It was removed from the campaign, which of course got me thinking that the film itself would be shocking beyond reason. While it did begin as such, it ultimately became a bland, uninteresting thriller. Frankly, this is not the controversial film that was promised. And let's not forget that its release was delayed, its opening date of May 16 changed to June 22 before July 13 was chosen. A delayed film is almost always a bad sign; the filmmakers use that extra time to reedit the film, usually into something that lacks the original vision.I obviously don't know if this was the case with ""Captivity."" All I know is that the final cut did not live up to my expectations. I have a sneaking suspicion that it won't live up to anyone else's expectations, either. I'm referring directly to the devotees of Torture Horror Movies, a relatively new genre that defined such films as ""Hostel,"" ""Saw,"" and ""Wolf Creek."" They will find that ""Captivity"" ends up going in the wrong direction, which is disappointing, considering how promising the first half was. When I stop and think about it, the fact that I got something out of it at all is pretty unsettling; films this unpleasant, this unabashedly mean spirited would entertain only the most select audiences. I can't say that I'm proud to be a part of it.",3,Movies Like This Can Be Torture,1184284800,"07 13, 2007",2007,5283,"[""'m"", 'shocked', 'appalled', 'actually', 'found', 'something', 'redeeming',

If you hate the former, focus on the latter, because when you do, this movie plays out quite well. The feeling of Elisha's character being already held captive by an adoring public and ridiculous ideals set by an anorexically unhealthy modeling industry and public expectationsis well portrayed. The bond she forms with another captive prisoner is plausible and even understandable in this horrifying predicament. Unfortunately, the plot twists are forseen far, far before the director decides to alert us, and the bloody nasty array of torture and psychological bombardment by the captors is unnecessarily brutal.

The reason there are so many negative reviews is because it's a woman who is tormented for the first 3/4 of the movie and not a man. This movie isn't concerned with political correctness, it's concerned with realism and fear, and let's face it, the majority of these kinds of crimes DO happen to women. It's an unfortunate fact (it's unfortunate when this kind of stuff happens to a woman OR a man), but that's what makes the movie so powerful. It feels very real. It's also incredibly unpredictable, with a shocking twist in the MIDDLE of the movie that will make your head spin! The ending is very satisfying as well! 'Captivity' is every bit as good as 'Saw' & 'Hostel'. The people who hate this movie are the same ones who hated Hostel 2. It was OK in the first Hostel when the majority of tortured victims were men, but when it was the womens' turn in Hostel 2 they got pissed!

It also strains plausibility/believability almost to the point of occasionally seeming very close to a spoof of those kinds of films, so you need to subtract at least one more point if you care about actual world verisimilitude.  And of course, the comparisons should suggest that this is a torture film.  It can get pretty graphic and brutal at that, so that will have some bearing on whether you enjoy Captivity or not.I normally don't care about originality so much, but Captivity received a slight reduction from me on that end because it fairly transparently seems like a ""cash in on the trend"" film.  Derivativeness when it is sincere inspiration, unwitting influence or sheer coincidence are fine with me.  But here, it seems more like the producers said, ""Hey, these films are hot right now; what can we do in the same vein, but a bit different, and that's also more extreme in some ways so we get kids talking about it like the latest thrill ride?""  Of course, I could be wrong about those intentions, but I have to go by what it seems like to me.I also normally don't care about plausibility so much, but I found myself somewhat lamenting that they didn't just go ahead and make the absurdist spoof film instead, as they're so often closer than a cigar.  Surely the time is ripe for a spoof of the genre.On the other hand, for what it is, Captivity does its job fairly well.  Elisha Cuthbert is certainly pleasant to look at, which is smart, because she's on screen about 90 percent of the time.  And although the ending may be a bit predictable once you get close to it--a door must be left open for sequels just in case the box office receipts are good, it also offers enough pleasantly twisted possibilities that I'm hoping a (probably low budget, direct-to-video) sequel is made despite the paltry financial showing Captivity actually had.

1098520,A34FEX6IPQL95G,B000V4UGZY,"Greg C. Unleashed ""cinemaguys.com""","[2, 2]","Have we not had our fill of sadistic torture, visceral moments, useless horror movies from companies such as Lionsgate films? They release foreign and independent films such as Hotel Rwanda and Fahrenheit 9/11. However, people will mainly recognize their name associated with action/adventure and horror films like Saw and even Hostel.Captivity is nothing more than a cheap version of the Saw Franchise, so why would they want to distribute this kind of junk? Furthermore, one then has to wonder why veteran--the Oscar winner--director, Roland Joffe who made good films like The Killing Fields (1984) and The Mission (1986) made a film like Captivity. Yes, he has gone on to directing less successful movies such as Super Mario Bros. (uncredited, 1993) and The Scarlet Letter (1995) but nothing like this. Is there an explanation for such a decline in his career? Because this movie is telling us that he has reach an all time low. We are puzzled about his choice, but we do understand that everyone needs a paycheck.New York City is a great place to be a fashion model and cover girl. All the best fashion photographers love to shoot Jennifer Tree (Elisha Cuthbert) and she loves the attention. Eventually this will be her demise because there is a faceless but ruthless stalker--who is obsessed with her beauty--that is pursuing her. She loves to party and she decides to go the local nightclub and while waiting for her drink, it is drugged by our villain.The next morning Jennifer wakes up confused but notices that she might be in a hotel; because of the view by the window is that of a beach. She starts walking over only to discover that the window is not authentic--it is a film screen, inside of a prison cell--that resembles a scene from Total Recall.Jennifer realizes that she is trapped. She must break out of her confinement but it will not be easy because there are cameras all round the room. Over the next several hours, she will have to undergo several psychological and sensory torture traps. During her ordeal, she discovers that she is not alone--there is a young man named Gary (Daniel Gillies [Spider man 2]) held prisoner in the next room. Within a short while, they devise an escape but the Killer foils it and they are put into their cells. Within a short time--because of the celebrity status of Jennifer--the NYPD are drawn into the disappearance of this famous person. What will be the out come of our couple? Will they escape the clutches of our pitiless executioner?As I have said in some of my earlier reviews like  Turistas and  Texas Chainsaw Massacre, we have had our fill of this genre when it comes to mindless torture and sadistic behavior of these serial killers that these movies glamorize. They become painfully predictable.The most interesting thing that we can say about Captivity is the way he uses the urban villain and hero, in this genre. He gives us an essence of a ""cat and mouse"" game through the teasing of our victim Jennifer. The best example of this is where he uses a sleeping gas to subdue her, but unfortunately, after the first forty minutes--because of the repetitiveness of this sequence--he starts loosing this style of suspense. Now, the movie and this spin on sadistic methods becomes just like a similar copy of the behaviors that we received from Jigsaw in the Saw movies with the ""Batman"" like traps but far less creativity. At least the villain from Saw had some ingenuity plus personality.Secondly, once the villain reveals himself and his true intentions--his real feelings for the girl--the movie becomes predictable and then proceeds to take the course of a very yuppie, version of an urban soap opera.Please proceed with caution when going to see this hollow, predictable, shallow, cheap copy of other films. The movie does have its moments with the cat and mouse approach by the director through the psychological tormenting of Jennifer, but looses this element of innovation through the torture sequences, which remind us of Saw and the TV show Fear Factor. The result: we are left with very little scaring moments or intensity because of the bad acting and storytelling.",3,Captivity is nothing more than a cheap version of the Saw Franchise,1196812800,"12 5, 2007",2007,4144,"['Have', 'not', 'had', 'fill', 'sadistic', 'torture', 'visceral', 'moments', 'useless', 'horror', 'movies', 'companies', 'such', 'Lionsgate', 'films', 'release', 'foreign', 'independent', 'films', 'such', 'Hotel', 'Rwanda', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'However', 'people', 'will', 'mainly', 'recognize', 'name', 'associated', 'action/adventure', 'horror', 'films', 'Saw', 'even', 'Hostel.Captivity', 'nothing', 'more', 'cheap', 'version', 'Saw', 'Franchise', 'so', 'why', 'would', 'want', 'distribute', 'kind', 'junk', 'Furthermore', 'one', 'then', 'wonder', 'why', 'veteran', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'director', 'Roland', 'Joffe', 'who', 'made', 'good', 'films', 'Killing', 'Fields', '1984', 'Mission', '1986', 'made', 'film', 'Captivity', 'Yes', 'gone', 'directing', 'less', 'successful', 'movies', 'such', 'Super', 'Mario', 'Bros.', 'uncredited', '1993', 'Scarlet', 'Letter', '1995', 'nothing', 'explanation', 'decline', 'career', 'movie', 'telling', 'reach', 'time', 'low', 'are', 'puzzled', 'choice', 'do', 'understand', 'everyone', 'paycheck.New', 'York', 'City', 'great', 'place', 'be', 'fashion', 'model', 'cover', 'girl', 'best', 'fashion', 'photographers', 'love', 'shoot', 'Jennifer', 'Tree', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'attention', 'Eventually', 'will', 'be', 'demise', 'faceless', 'ruthless', 'stalker', 'who', 'obsessed', 'beauty', 'pursuing', 'party', 'go', 'local', 'nightclub', 'waiting', 'drink', 'drugged', 'villain.The', 'next', 'morning', 'Jennifer', 'up', 'confused', 'notices', 'might', 'be', 'hotel', 'view', 'window', 'beach', 'walking', 'only', 'discover', 'window', 'not', 'authentic', 'film', 'screen', 'prison', 'cell', 'scene', 'Total', 'Recall.Jennifer', 'trapped', 'must', 'break', 'confinement', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'easy', 'are', 'cameras', 'round', 'room', 'next', 'several', 'hours', 'will', 'have', 'undergo', 'several', 'psychological', 'sensory', 'torture', 'traps', 'ordeal', 'not', 'alone', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Gary', 'Daniel', 'Gillies', '[', 'Spider', 'man', '2', ']', 'held', 'prisoner', 'next', 'room', 'short', 'while', 'devise', 'escape', 'Killer', 'are', 'put', 'cells', 'short', 'time', 'celebrity', 'status', 'Jennifer', 'NYPD', 'are', 'drawn', 'disappearance', 'famous', 'person', 'What', 'will', 'be', 'out', 'come', 'couple', 'escape', 'clutches', 'pitiless', 'executioner', 'have', 'said', 'earlier', 'reviews', 'Turistas', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'have', 'had', 'fill', 'genre', 'when', 'mindless', 'torture', 'sadistic', 'behavior', 'serial', 'killers', 'movies', 'glamorize', 'become', 'painfully', 'predictable.The', 'most', 'interesting', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'Captivity', 'way', 'urban', 'villain', 'hero', 'genre', 'essence', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'teasing', 'victim', 'Jennifer', 'best', 'example', 'where', 'sleeping', 'gas', 'subdue', 'unfortunately', 'first', 'forty', 'minutes', 'repetitiveness', 'sequence', 'loosing', 'style', 'suspense', 'Now', 'movie', 'spin', 'sadistic', 'methods', 'becomes', 'just', 'similar', 'copy', 'behaviors', 'received', 'Jigsaw', 'Saw', 'movies', 'Batman', 'traps', 'far', 'less', 'creativity', 'least', 'villain', 'Saw', 'had', 'ingenuity', 'personality.Secondly', 'once', 'villain', 'reveals', 'true', 'intentions', 'real', 'feelings', 'girl', 'movie', 'predictable', 'then', 'proceeds', 'take', 'course', 'very', 'yuppie', 'version', 'urban', 'soap', 'opera.Please', 'proceed', 'caution', 'when', 'going', 'see', 'hollow', 'predictable', 'shallow', 'cheap', 'copy', 'other', 'films', 'movie', 'have', 'moments', 'cat', 'mouse', 'approach', 'director', 'psychological', 'tormenting', 'Jennifer', 'element', 'innovation', 'torture', 'sequences', 'remind', 'Saw', 'TV', 'show', 'Fear', 'Factor', 'result', 'are', 'left', 'very', 'little', 'scaring', 'moments', 'intensity', 'bad', 'acting', 'storytelling']",N/A

1098524,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B000V4UGZY,Jason,"[0, 0]","Captivity starts with a grisly murder, a scene reminiscent of each of the worst scenes in any of the Saw movies.  A hooded, disguised killer has a victim strapped to a chair, with a tube in his mouth.  The tube is connected to some sort of toxic chemical, and there is no way for the tube to be removed.  It's clear that the victim is horrified, and completely aware of the impending doom.  It's creepy, ominous, and sets a great tone for the remainder of the movie.Elisha Cuthbert is stunning as she plays Jennifer Tree, a hyper-busy, some what conceited covergirl/model, constantly doing interviews, and appearing on TV.  She lives life beyond the means of most, going so far as buying gourmet food for her dog!  This attention, however, draws some unwanted attention that eventually causes problems.Shortly into the film, it becomes clear that Jennifer is being stalked and filmed, establishing very clear foreshadowing, and causing the viewer to connect her potential attacker and the previous murder.  Sure enough, she's drugged, abducted, and the stage is set for the rest of the movie.It's really a cross between the riddles of Saw and Se7en, the imprisonment of Kiss the Girls, and the torture aspect of Hostel.If viewers can get past the borderline plot plagiarism, the suspense is actually somewhat enticing, the acting fairly believable, and the scenarios quite ingenius and terrifying.  Elisha Cuthbert is mesmerizing, absolutely stealing every scene; she's an absolute star whose beauty is truly worth the price of admission.  Although, it's hard to watch a single scene without thinking of a myriad other horror movies from which ""Captivity"" borrowed various concepts.It's mindless gore, suspense, and screams for the not-so-faint-hearted.

The movie manages to borrow heavily--and poorly--from the 'Saw' and 'Hostel' franchises and blatantly steals--again poorly--from 'Dexter.'This movie is so terrible that I honestly believe in the years/decades to come it will be seen as the film that killed the current horror trend. The horror genre is one that comes in and out of fashion with the general movie-going public and I believe this film might just be responsible for ending the most recent movement just as 'Saw' can be said to have sparked it. It's a true trend-killer; the film is so bad that it literally casts a bad light on the entire genre--that bad. It will be a few years before the next horror trend is kicked off and my guess is that the genre will go in a different direction from the extreme violence/gore/torture trajectory typified in films such as 'Saw,' 'Wolf Creek' and 'Hostel' which dominated the 2004-2007 horror landscape.Don't get me wrong: I am not knocking the aforementioned trend.

Elisha Cuthbert plays a model who is drugged, kidnapped, held prisoner and tortured by an unknown assailant.  During the first portion of the movie, she is essentially the only character, and she is not a very interesting one.  For a long time, we know little about her - and nothing of the motivations of her captor - so it is hard to care about her on anything but the most basic level.  Eventually, another prisoner appears, and then the plot twists begin; the only problem is that every twist can be seen coming long before it happens.  And considering how ""brilliant"" the villain is, he leaves a relatively obvious trail for the police to at least suspect him.On the other hand, while watching Captivity, I began to wonder if it is really just a parody of the so-called ""torture porn"" genre which has the Saw and Hostel movies as its most prominent members.  After all, this movie takes torture porn to its extreme:  all torture, no character, with a plot that is minimal (and rather dumb), a conclusion that is just plain silly and a bunch of cliches (like the supposedly dead person who pops back to life).As a straight horror flick, this rates one star.

I had to turn my head away a couple times, but for the most part it was fun.  The biggest flaw (and there were a few) was that I figured out the plot twist very early in the film.  It was way too obvious.  Then there was the abduction.  Jennifer's face (Elisha was Jennifer) was plastered all over New York City.  She was a top model and her picture was on billboards, taxis and buses.  You couldn't turn around without seeing her picture. So how did no one in this nightclub not recognize her?  How did no one in this busy place not see her go to the ladies lounge?  How did no one notice the most attractive girl in New York almost passing out as she walked across the room?  Daniel Gillies played Jerry, another prisoner held in the same building as Jennifer.  When the climax comes Jerry's resourcefulness pales in comparison to Jennifer.  If anybody should have been doing the rescuing...  Enough with the flaws though.  The cover said this was a movie from the studio behind 8 films to die for.

Look don't be fooled if anyone says this was good. Trust me. What starts out as something that seems unique and interesting turns out to be a run-of-the-mill torture flick and not even a good one. You have bad acting, predictable characters, bad writing and downright silliness.Jennifer (Elisha Cuthbert) plays a fashion model who is stalked and kidnapped by a man who loves to torture people. Wow, that's so original. She is drugged, tied up and only let loose to engage in sick torture games that turn out to be just as lame as this movie. After twenty minutes of watching this you'll be begging to be kidnapped just to be free of this crap. Of course she finds a ""friend"", Gary who is a prisoner also (or is he?). From that point on this movie goes from bad to worse to painfully far-fetched.The writing is just bad. You can't even get into the movie because there are so many plot holes. Where the film tries to be suspenseful and mysterious, it just falls into corny and predictable. There wasn't one compelling or frightening thing in this movie except the acting. For you to get the idea of how ridiculous this film is, in the middle of the movie, Jennifer and Gary stop to have sex only one scene after they've both been tortured. Yes you read that right. Jennifer managed to swallow her fear long enough to get her rocks off even though she's supposed to be so terrified. Really? Really? Not to mention that she doesn't even know Gary! She knew him for half a day yet the only thing she can think to do is have sex with him?Another one of my many complaints would be the lighting. The entire film is full of dark scenes that it's hard to see anything at all. I don't know if this was meant to bring thrills or if they wanted the scenes dark so we couldn't see the horrific props. You couldn't see much of anything at all. Each torture scene looked just like the one before it. You could barely see what the man was doing to Jennifer let alone care about it.I just couldn't forgive Jennifer and her lack of being realistic. She is supposed to be so scared yet she can just lay down and sleep and sit around the room like it's no big deal. She tried to get away for the first five minutes then after that you didn't care if she got away because all you want is for the movie to end. The ending is unforgivable. The ending tries to be slick and creative but it is nothing new. By the time the film is almost over, you won't care who is doing what.This is not the worst movie I've seen but it's up there. The real tragedy was that this could've been pretty decent if the writing had been better. But there was absolutely nothing new about this. It was like a low-budget Saw and that's saying a lot.If you just wanna watch trash and waste a few hours of your life check it out. But the only thing scary is what a pitiful excuse for a movie this is. I wouldn't pay one penny for this.

In the 'making of', he's convinced he's created a serious examination of the captor/captive dynamic. Any serious analysis takes a backseat to scenes of gore and torture. Jennifer Tree (Elisha Cuthbert) is a fashion model who gets kidnapped after a charity event. She awakes in a dark room and it doesn't take long for her torture to begin. This ranges from psychological (being buried alive in sand, thinking her skin is melting during a shower of acid rain) to physical (being fed a shake consisting of ears and eyeballs, and having her annoying dog exploding all over here). The film is a weak imitation of 'Saw'. The only glimpses we get of Jennifer are from interviews shown in flashbacks. She comes off as a spoiled blond so we don't really care about her. The plot takes a turn for the worst when Joffe introduces us to another captive named Gary (Daniel Gillies). Against all odds and logic him and Jennifer fall in love and hook up. The sex scene comes after Gary has just had his teeth yanked out with a pliers. If you had just endured that would your immediate concern be getting laid? Naturally Gary isn't who Jennifer thinks he is and the last part of the movie finds her learning his true identity. This was the only part of the movie that was mildly entertaining. My movie rule is that no matter how weak things start, if that last half hour is strong enough to make you rethink what came before it, than it's not a total failure.

A good deal of that had to do with a questionable ad campaign released briefly in Los Angeles (which, let's face it, doesn't have thing one to do with the movie itself, and any review that spends a decent amount of time excoriating the ad campaign should be dismissed as the agenda-soaked rhetoric it actually is), and the rest of it simply dismissed this as just another piece of torture porn. But here's the thing: &lt;em>Captivity&lt;/em> wasn't meant to be just another piece of torture porn. That decision was made after the fact, by After Dark and Lionsgate. There are more than enough places in the film itself where the original intent, a straight mystery/thriller, comes out, and looked at in that way it's actually not all that bad a movie. After all, one does not attach the names on this movie to torture porn. I mean, you've got Roland Joff&eacute; (&lt;em>Fat Man and Little Boy&lt;/em>, &lt;em>The Mission&lt;/em>, &lt;em>The Killing Fields&lt;/em>, etc.) behind the camera working off a Larry Cohen (&lt;em>The Stuff&lt;/em>, &lt;em>It's Alive&lt;/em>, etc.) screenplay. And in front of the camera you've got Elisha Cuthbert (&lt;em>24&lt;/em>), Daniel Gillies (&lt;em>Spider-Man 2&lt;/em>) and, perhaps most tellingly, Pruitt Taylor Vince (&lt;em>The Legend of 1900&lt;/em>). These are not names you associate with quickie gore films. Mystery/thrillers, on the other hand? Right up their alley.Plot: Jennifer (Cuthbert) is a spoiled-little-rich-girl model used to getting what she wants. Which is all well and good right up until she gets kidnapped and wakes up chained up in a basement. She believes she's alone until another person, on the other side of the wall, finds a way to signal through a window. This is Gary (Gillies), being held captive on the other side of the wall. The two of them must attempt to figure out how to get out of there, who kidnapped them, and why.I think part of the mechanism of whether this movie will work for you or not is whether you see the Big Twist(TM) that happens towards the end of the movie coming. I didn't, which surprises me, and in that respect I did find this a workable thriller. On the other hand, there's all the post-production recutting that was done by the production and distribution companies, which did in fact turn this into just another piece of torture porn. I'd like to see a director's cut. I want to know what this movie looked like before the post-production idiots got their hands on it. 'cause I'll bet you it's a really solid movie.

I'm glad I didn't....it was very entertaining.Granted, the torture and violence scenes were a bit nauseating, but once the true motivation became evident, they make better sense than the gratuitous violence in other ""torture-bondage"" movies. I especially liked the ""high-protein"" milk shake prepared for poor Elisha by her captor. Let's face it, she had refused normal nutritional supplements and had to be kept healthy....for reasons you must watch to understand.The acting was as good or better than you would expect in a gore-fest, the photography was excellent, and if you watch the extra features on the DVD, the director and crew went all-out for detail. This isn't your typical hand-held video of amateur actors hacking away at each other without benefit of plot. The production values are quite good. Yes, there are some cliches typical of all such movies, but overall the acting was as good as it needed to be and the plot made sense. To be honest, this is a lot more than you can say about the majority of movies of this type.For these reasons, I recommend that you ignore the negative comments from my fellow reviewers and give this jewel a chance.

Back in the day, we used to watch terrible horror movies because you were going to get a couple of jolts, a couple of chuckles, and some quality nudity.  I didn't make the rules, that's just what bad cheap horror movies supplied.So I'm a little dismayed by the modern ""horror"" movie.  The violence is grotesquely and lovingly portrayed.  Scenes are awash in blood and stomach-churning special effects.  Humor?  I'd hate to know anyone who found any of these torture porn movies amusing.  And the quality nudity?  Just doesn't happen.  These movies are just as incredibly chaste as they are sickeningly violent.  Doesn't make a lot of sense to me...but I'm not sure which is worse: the titillation aspect with the torture or just the clinical slaughtering of both genders.Any way you want to see it, a movie like CAPTIVITY is just another tedious exercise in excessive punishment and torture.  If you're getting this movie because of Elisha Cuthbert...you'd see far more of her in a Maxim magazine than here.  If you want to see her play a character that's interesting and worth caring about...you'd see more of her in a Maxim magazine.A vile and unnecessary movie.  It feels like cobbled scenes from other lame torture porn movies.  Nothing original, nothing different.

Elisha Cuthbert is the difference between Captivity and the dozens of lame horror movies produced every year. Don't get me wrong, Captivity is full of gore and has a ridiculously stupid storyline, but it's not that bad, and Cuthbert is the reason. The veteran actress, best known as Kim Bauer and The Girl Next Door, is very methodical with every move she makes and that really manages to keep your attention. The maze of traps, moving walls, and pitfalls were also really cool, but outside of that and Cuthbert, Captivity is your typical gore fest, with zero character development, and a chilling story that really doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
