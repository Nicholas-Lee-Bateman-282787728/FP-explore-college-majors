I mean, how engrossing can a film about fly-fishing really be?  In the end though, I have to say that I was blown away by how beautifully paced and effortlessly endearing this film really was.I guess that's obvious from the five-star rating I handed it.The film (much more than a mere `fishing film') tells the true story of two brothers growing up (and growing apart) in Montana.  Norman and Paul are a peculiar pair, two boys cut from the same mold and yet very different, very distinct.  Norman (the films narrator) has dreams much larger than his Montana home, while Paul dwells in the comforts (and vices) that come from his laid back life, soaking up the fly-fishing of his youth and making it a central part of his present.  But, life lessons come hard for the pair as they buck society, especially Paul who is an apologetic rebel with a severe losing streak (and substantial gambling debts).The film comes to life in the acting talents, especially that of Brad Pitt.  Pitt has so much charisma and charm, and it is a beautiful thing when a character comes along that allows him to embrace that part of himself while still adding depth to the role.  The 90's were a good decade for Pitt (between `Thelma and Louise', `A River Runs Through It', `Legends of the Fall', `Seven' and `Fight Club' the man had a ridiculous string of success), in fact he may be the biggest star of the 90's.  What he does here, in `A River Runs Through It', is beautiful.  Taking the rebellious streak of Paul and giving it the angst and painful remorse needed to make him relatable and human, Pitt creates a memorable character who outlives the film itself.But for me the best thing about this film is Robert Redford (you won't hear me say that too often) and his deft hand at relaying, with tender restraint, the beauty of this budding `sibling' relationship.  You can feel the love and respect just flow from Redford's every pore as he delicately settles into telling this beautiful story.  The camera finds the right nooks to explore and the right scenes to embellish.  The film glows with subtle yet substantial depth, and a lot of that falls on the shoulders of the man who helmed it.So, if you doubt a film about fly-fishing will touch your heart, think again.  This film extracts the right amount of humanity in every scene, making the art of casting a line as heart-tugging as humanly possible.",5,Right through my heart...,1298937600,"03 1, 2011",2011,2466,"['really', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'like', 'movie', 'much', 'looked', 'incredibly', 'boring', 'mean', 'how', 'engrossing', 'can', 'film', 'fly-fishing', 'really', 'be', 'end', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'how', 'beautifully', 'paced', 'effortlessly', 'endearing', 'film', 'really', 'was.I', 'guess', 'obvious', 'five-star', 'rating', 'handed', 'it.The', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'mere', 'fishing', 'film', 'true', 'story', 'two', 'brothers', 'growing', 'up', 'growing', 'apart', 'Montana', 'Norman', 'Paul', 'are', 'peculiar', 'pair', 'two', 'boys', 'cut', 'same', 'mold', 'yet', 'very', 'different', 'very', 'distinct', 'Norman', 'films', 'narrator', 'dreams', 'much', 'larger', 'Montana', 'home', 'Paul', 'dwells', 'comforts', 'vices', 'come', 'laid', 'back', 'life', 'soaking', 'up', 'fly-fishing', 'youth', 'making', 'central', 'part', 'present', 'life', 'lessons', 'come', 'hard', 'pair', 'buck', 'society', 'especially', 'Paul', 'who', 'apologetic', 'rebel', 'severe', 'losing', 'streak', 'substantial', 'gambling', 'debts', '.The', 'film', 'life', 'acting', 'talents', 'especially', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Pitt', 'so', 'much', 'charisma', 'charm', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'when', 'character', 'embrace', 'part', 'still', 'adding', 'depth', 'role', '90', 'were', 'good', 'decade', 'Pitt', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'River', 'Runs', 'Legends', 'Fall', 'Seven', 'Fight', 'Club', 'man', 'had', 'ridiculous', 'string', 'success', 'fact', 'may', 'be', 'biggest', 'star', '90', 'What', 'here', 'River', 'Runs', 'beautiful', 'Taking', 'rebellious', 'streak', 'Paul', 'giving', 'angst', 'painful', 'remorse', 'needed', 'make', 'relatable', 'human', 'Pitt', 'memorable', 'character', 'who', 'film', 'itself.But', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hear', 'say', 'too', 'often', 'deft', 'hand', 'relaying', 'tender', 'restraint', 'beauty', 'budding', 'sibling', 'relationship', 'can', 'feel', 'love', 'respect', 'just', 'flow', 'Redford', 'pore', 'delicately', 'telling', 'beautiful', 'story', 'camera', 'right', 'nooks', 'explore', 'right', 'scenes', 'embellish', 'film', 'subtle', 'yet', 'substantial', 'depth', 'lot', 'shoulders', 'man', 'who', 'helmed', 'it.So', 'doubt', 'film', 'fly-fishing', 'will', 'touch', 'heart', 'think', 'again', 'film', 'right', 'amount', 'humanity', 'scene', 'making', 'art', 'casting', 'line', 'as', 'heart-tugging', 'humanly', 'possible']",A River Runs Through It

The first few times I saw A River Runs Through It since it initially came out in 1992, I viewed it as the first of two Montana Brad Pitt pictures. But now, I've come to the realization it is a moral story about how somebody who seems to need the most help couldn't be helped because, like the title says, A River Runs Through It. It's an incredible film of superb performances by Craig Sheffer, Brad Pitt, Tom Skerritt, Emily Lloyd, and Brenda Blethyn. Of course, it's nice to see the three topics of religion, Montana, and fly fishing to interweave together as a tale to be told. Although I like Ordinary People, A River Runs Through It is easily Robert Redford's best directed picture. The cinematography is a lovely touch, and of course, who couldn't in Montana?

21300,AORW1FRF4D4KS,0767836359,azindn,"[17, 19]","I have seen all the films directed by Robert Redford and appreciated his love of the American people and the land.  In A River Runs Through It, Redford displays the lyric romanticism and visual splendor of the high Rocky Mountins of Montana as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt.  This film makes love to the visual and the word, with text by author Norman Maclean, and stunning camera work by Phillippe Rousselot (Serpent's Kiss, Reigne Margot).Redford's cast is perfect.  Tom Skerritt is the Rev. MacLean, a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the Bible, Brenda Blythen, the mother, and his sons, Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons, and later, complex young men.  Both Schaffer and Pitt are totally believable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever.  It is the relationships between men, father and sons, brothers, and their women to the outside world that grounds A River Runs Through It to a vein of storytelling that is missing in so many of Hollywood films produced in recent years.What makes these relationships special however, is the attention Redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue.  This is a literate script, beautiful to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the stunning Montana rivers and mountains.  The words and setting are equal to performances by a cast that rises to their material.  While the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story, it is not so implausible in Redford's directorial hands.  Given the material, Redford's ode to a simpler time and life is worth revisiting again and again.  This treasure of a film should be included in every collection.",5,"Sublime, Picturesque, an Ode to the American Land",1004572800,"11 1, 2001",2001,1839,"['have', 'seen', 'films', 'directed', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'appreciated', 'love', 'American', 'people', 'land', 'River', 'Runs', 'Redford', 'lyric', 'romanticism', 'visual', 'splendor', 'high', 'Rocky', 'Mountins', 'Montana', 'were', '19th', 'century', 'landscape', 'painter', 'ilk', 'Thomas', 'Moran', 'Albert', 'Bierstadt', 'film', 'love', 'visual', 'word', 'text', 'author', 'Norman', 'Maclean', 'stunning', 'camera', 'work', 'Phillippe', 'Rousselot', 'Serpent', 'Kiss', 'Reigne', 'Margot', '.Redford', 'cast', 'perfect', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'Rev', 'MacLean', 'man', 'methods', 'education', 'include', 'fly', 'fishing', 'as', 'well', 'Bible', 'Brenda', 'Blythen', 'mother', 'sons', 'Craig', 'Schaffer', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'create', 'family', 'interactions', 'reflect', 'same', 'problems', 'encounter', 'growing', 'teenage', 'sons', 'later', 'complex', 'young', 'men', 'Schaffer', 'Pitt', 'are', 'totally', 'believable', 'brothers', 'love', 'fly', 'fishing', 'other', 'will', 'tie', 'together', 'forever', 'relationships', 'men', 'father', 'sons', 'brothers', 'women', 'outside', 'world', 'River', 'Runs', 'vein', 'storytelling', 'missing', 'so', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'produced', 'recent', 'years.What', 'relationships', 'special', 'however', 'attention', 'Redford', 'language', 'spoken', 'dialogue', 'literate', 'script', 'beautiful', 'hear', 'unforgettable', 'when', 'coupled', 'stunning', 'Montana', 'rivers', 'mountains', 'words', 'setting', 'are', 'equal', 'performances', 'cast', 'material', 'idea', 'fly', 'fishing', 'may', 'seem', 'odd', 'device', 'center', 'story', 'not', 'so', 'implausible', 'Redford', 'directorial', 'hands', 'Given', 'material', 'Redford', 'ode', 'simpler', 'time', 'life', 'worth', 'revisiting', 'again', 'again', 'treasure', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'included', 'collection']",A River Runs Through It
21301,AI46E73DWKD2B,0767836359,BackToGood,"[4, 4]","There's only one film that I can think of where when watching it, I literally feel like I'm literally flipping the pages of a book as I'm watching it, and that film is A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT (1992). It is one of the most ""pure"" films that I've ever seen. Set in a small rural community in early 20th century Montana, the film is much more than your by-the-numbers, slice-of-life period piece that Hollywood trots out from time to time. It authentically evokes a real time and place and puts the viewer there, a rare feat. It is not a film of overt depth, yet it has a focused simplicity that effectively translates many basic truths about people that films that try to go deep often fail to do. It allows it's characters to develop at a leisurely pace and grow on the viewer. It doesn't beat the viewer over the head with character details and have scenes where they seem to be in a vacuum. Last but not least, it is one of the most beautifully shot films ever made.Directed by Robert Redford, I'd say that A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT is his best accomplishment as a film director. Redford also narrates it from the point of view of the main character Norman MacLean (played with sublime confidence by Craig Sheffer). Redford's narration is perhaps the best narration that I've heard in any film...EVER! His narrative is a huge reason why this film works; it is perfectly timed, placed, and spaced, almost like another character in the film. It is ironic that Redford narrates from the POV of Sheffer's character Norman, when it is Brad Pitt, the actor that plays Norman's younger brother Paul, that was considered to be the second coming of Redford. Pitt, who is invigorating and engrossing performance as Paul, gives perhaps the most unpretentious performance of his career. While Norman is our guide and observer, Paul is the film's center, the conduit between the clean-cut, pristine world of the MacLean family (the typical American ideal) and the local brothels, bars, and gambling joints (the seedy underbelly of society).Rounding out the main cast are Tom Skerritt and Brenda Blethyn as Reverend and Mrs. McLean, the parents of Norman and Paul, and Emily Lloyd, as Norman's future wife Jessie. Skerritt and Blethyn are pitch perfect in their roles, each representing the traditional parental stereotypes, the stern father and the worrisome mother. Lloyd is sweet and charming as Jessie and her courtship with Norman is refreshing as it is simply the story of 2 people who found each other at the right time and place that realize they are each other's soulmates. Additionally, there is a diverse cast of scene-stealing supporting characters providing welcome comic relief played by Stephen Shellen (Jessie's brother), Edie McClurg (Jessies' mom), and especially Susan Traylor (as the local wild girl).Sheffer and Pitt don't resemble each other in reality, but they really seem like REAL brothers with a love-hate sibling rivalry that never boils over into anything absurd. The way they play off each other is great. The MacLean family scenes are so inviting and authentic that it's unreal! When watching them, I almost felt discomfort at times that I felt like I was spying on them. I would wager that many parents can relate to this family's situation...The Reverend MacLean worrying about his 2 sons' future and Mrs. MacLean just plain WORRYING! And Norman and Jesse's relationship is sweet and understated. The film also dares to subtly tackle issues such as racism (the Indian girl that Paul brings on a double-date with Norman and Jesse) as well and to realistically show the seamier, seedier side of Paul's life (gambling halls and brothels).The main draw of A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT is the immaculate, pristine scenery of the Montana, the mountains, plains, sky and beautiful rivers. I was glad to find out that the cinematography for this film took home the Oscar because if any film deserves it, this one does! I just wish it had gotten a bit more recognition from the Academy. What Redford has crafted here is extraordinary. As much as the cinematography has been rightly praised, it is the attention to character detail and how it complements the scenery that impresses me the most about this masterwork of cinema.

Maybe I was wrong.Craig Sheffer plays Norman, the older brother, and Brad Pitt plays Paul, the younger. They actually look like brothers, which helps a lot. They are the sons of Reverend Maclean, a rather stiff Presbyterian who loves fly fishing almost as much as he loves God, and who sees God in his Montana rivers and the entire fresh, wholesome region.The bulk of the story takes place during prohibition, and there is an element of that, and of the lawlessness it promoted, in the story. But that's not really what it's about. Norman goes east to Dartmouth, and Paul goes to college in Montana, then takes a job at a local newspaper. But those differences are not really what it is about either. There are women in their lives, good luck and bad luck, but it's really not about that, either.What is about is a lot harder to describe. It's philosophical, rather than religious, although there sits Reverend Maclean to make it sound like religion. He's a gentle, wise old soul, not one of those hellfire types.

21303,ALR35EFI69S5R,0767836359,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[9, 10]","When this film was first released, some critics called it more a travel commercial for Montana than anything else, since it so lovingly handles the scenes of the family members involved in the sacrament of fly-fishing. For those of us who fell in love with the original novel celebrating the ways in which the fishing proclivities of these two brothers framed the outlines of a wonderful story about coming of age, and the tragedy of personal misdirection, this film adaptation by Robert Redford strikes a responsive chord. As he did in ""the Natural' and also in ""The Horse Whisperer"", Redford uses the staggering beauty of the natural environment to emphasize in boldface the ways in which each of us makes decisions as to how to conduct ourselves in ways that either foster our own development and growth, on the one hand, or to take a more sinister route, on the other.Brad Pitt is perfectly cast here, in the first opportunity he had to show his amazing acting range as the brother hell-bent on doing things the hard and ultimately destructive way in stark contrast to his older brother, played well by Craig Sheffer, who seems more grounded, better oriented, and more likely to be able to carry out his dreams, which ultimately take him away from his beloved Montana. The story basically revolves around the ways in which the choices each makes based on their own needs, perceptions, and personality seals their fates. In this sense it is as much a morality play as a story about the ways in which love and involvement don't necessarily cure all ills.  Of course, it is also a story about the relationship each of the brothers has with their father, a minister who considers fishing more a religious activity than a sport. Yet Pitt's character, a natural fly-fisherman who casts like a dream, is unable to translate this particular form of genius into his own personal life to give him either peace or happiness.It is a lovely film, a terrific period piece, and a lovingly directed bit of transformation of a superb novel to the silver screen.

21306,A3C54XWT93R2WY,0767836359,"Been around this block, several times over","[1, 5]","In itself, loving is tragic.  But most of us are not raised to live loveless and alone.  This film, as does the book out of which it came about, takes us through the agony of when love has passed . . . as loved ones pass away, and we are left alone to pay the long price of our short experience of love.  In our daily lives, the rule seems to be: Thou shalt not appreciate whilst thou hast!  It is in the not having-- or, more precisely, in the no longer having-- that we gain a fuller measure of realization of what we had.No wonder we feel so compelled to imagine a God with a Paradise . . . actually, just a fantacized opportunity to do it all over again (and again, and again, for eternity, until we might hopefully get it right).  But we cannot appreciate what we have when we have it because to do so throughout the time we have the love we seek would rob us of the pleasure of first falling-- i.e., the initial falling in love.  So we soon lose interest in as we abandon what we have, and go off seeking it (what we already have) all over again.  It would seem that to us it is NOT so much the ""having"" as the ""falling"" for it that drives us.Of course, the point is that the joy of falling lies in its illusion of timelessness.  Thus, once we land and our loving thereafter plateaus, proceeding without further falling, we are faced with the dreadful prospect that love (unlike falling into it) is transient.  It eventually ends (by betrayal, taking for granted, or death).  This is where this movie takes us so starkly-- the transitoriness of the rivers of time.  The flow even gives us the impression of concrete gifts in the fish it grants the skilled angler, but anyone who has kept fish too long before consuming it knows oh so well how transitory that gift of the waters is.  Fishing, therefore, draws us right into the middle of that transitoriness.  The film teaches us that however permanent our happiness might seem when we are falling, a river always runs through it . . . a river of time.The first hint of Paul's gambling problems in the police sergeant's comments left me wondering why the story had suddenly become so obvious about where it is going so early.  But fishing hero Paul's tragic flaw is not his gambling, but his belief that by plucking the fish out of the river he will overcome the compelling force of the river's flow.  For a moment I thought he would drown as he caught that fish of fishes, but he surmounts.  That got me hopeful, and I forgot (as apparently Paul had) about the gambling . . . I took my eyes off of the fact that no matter how great the achievement, a river runs through it.  The river as mere water did not swallow him up; but the river as the flow of life, love, and temporality sure did!In the end, I think of this movie as an emotional dum-dum bullet: it makes a very small entry hole, but a gigantic exit wound on the other side.

The story is a simple, yet moving one and the scenery is breathtaking--a natural side-effect of its gorgeous setting, the Bitteroot Mountains in Montana.The characters are tender and their lives are real and delicate.  The themes concern the nature of faith (both in God and in the people you love) and the helplessness of watching those you love self-destruct; they are conveyed with patience and generousity of spirit.  The director respects the individality and privacy of his subjects.I usually refrain from commenting on other reviews here, but I would like to state that this film is, in no way, ""clueless..."" or vapid.  It acknowledges some sad truths about human beings and their frailties...frailties born of love.  There is no perfect faith and no perfect human being and it is often hardest for us to help the ones closest to us.

'On the banks of the Big Blackfoot River....' a place I've been, and long to return.  Nothing, el zippo, tops the splendor and majesty of Montana, nothing even comes close!  It's timeless valleys, raging aqua-tinted torrents, and green alpine towns and villages dispersed all throughout its western landscapes define 'National Treasure.'  Missoula, Montana, home to the Maclean family, is a good old fashioned town of turmoil and unsetteldness squaring off against an unmistakable serenity with nature's works and ways.  'To the beat of a four count rhythm....' might not be the most instructive of flyfishing casting approaches (I've lost many a woolybugger in willow trees climbable only by the most inane of flytiers), but it makes for undulating cinema.  'Oh I could never leave Montana brother...' is a line beckoning truth; after visiting Montana on several occasions (first was an Amtrack train ride in '94... ok a person could easily get up and go from Havre, MT) getting to catch sights of Glacier to the north, the Bitterroot range in the south, and all that lies in between (e.g. Flathead Lake)....there are no fleeting instincts.  A geologist could be lost in paradise in, say, Yellowstone for ages, not even taking into consideration the abundance of mountain ranges lining Montana's western front - stretching north to south, from Great Falls to Anaconda.  Redford's directing brings along the viewer through every imaginable trace of landmark - riverbanks, pubs, train stations, backyard fields with forest and mountain top afar, and even a couple sunburned rawhides!  Not a favorite still shot.  Boats are stolen, category 'forget about it' white waters are paddled through, unpaid gambling wagers bring conflict wrought with misunderstanding, dinner table discussions of Calvin Coolidge's fishing secret '...what are they bitin on?....The end of my line!' and job satisfaction are brought up, shortcuts winding their way through train tunnels are taken, and in the end, reflection and memories are revealed in honest fashion.  Verdant pastures and picueresque backdrops steal the film's premise, offering more than just basic storyline.  But the moment of closure is why I adore Robert Redford's film set in Missoula....in addition to the melancholic violin intermezzos.'On some of the rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs. I am haunted by waters.'Anyone ever visiting Montana will register in their sights and other senses this inescapable impression.  Don't forget, if you're going to fish these pristine waters (i.e. Yellowstone, Clearwater Creek, Madison, Bighorn, Big Hole, Gallatin, Beaverhead, Kootenai Rivers), catch-and-release is the only real keeper!  A River Runs Through It is a Montana dreamscape.  Once more, if going there, remember to 'Enjoy the Silence.'",5,Spellbinding!

It launched a group of movies where the action takes place in Montana.  It tells the true story of Norm Mclean, a Montana born author who is the man of letters from just after the final years of the frontier in America, and Montana in the 1920's was only a generation away from the frontier experience.The intro to the movie is a master telling of beautiful words, it sets the tone for the entire film.  It almost...almost...has the same pace and meter of the first chapter of the Gospel of John.""In my family, there was no clear line between religion and fly fishing. We lived at the junction of great trout rivers in Missoula, Montana where Indians still appeared out of the wilderness to walk the honky tonks and brothels of Front Street.""The story centers around Norm Mclean, his brother Paul-a sort of Cain and Able pair.  Using rich detail the movie explores Norm's relationships with his family, future wife, and future in-laws in a manner all can identify with.  Through it, is fly fishing, the one activity that unites Norm with his father and brother in a way like no other.  It is different than the book in that the events in the book play out when the Mclean brothers are much older men-Norm is married with children and has a career in Illinois.  In the movie, Norm is just out of graduate school, only courting Jessie, and in a younger phase of life.  This altered detail gives the movie a much greater emotional impact than the book.Ultimately, the film is a careful study of the people one loves-despite their flaws, and it seeks to assuage the grief of losing a loved one when such a loss has no clear answers-no greater meaning.

21318,A28WJUJF6D2ULA,0767836359,Dai-keag-ity,"[5, 5]","A River Runs Through It is a difficult film to review or even fairly comment upon. It is beautifully-filmed and overflowing with the sort of natural scenery---thick dark forests, cold, free-flowing rivers, wide-open skies---that in most movies would steal the show. It also features a cast of actors, Tom Skerit,  Emily Lloyd, Craig Sheffer, Brad Pitt, giving what I will long remain convinced is the most outstanding performance of their careers. This classic 1991 motion picture (re-)tells the true story of writer Norman Maclean's youth and early adulthood nearly a century ago in the wilds of rural Montana. Norman is a deep, pensive person, in many ways the opposite of his younger brother Paul, a free-spirited daredevil whose adventurous nature is good-hearted but perilous, as everyone around him except Paul himself seems to see. Norman and Paul's father is an upstanding Presbyterian minister whose scholarly erudition and sternly eloquent sermons give way at frequent intervals to undertaking the great passion in his life: fly fishing. The Reverend Maclean loves nothing more than to take his sons to the river to fly fish for trout. On these trips the elder Maclean imparts life's lessons to the boys and passes on words of wisdom they will each go on to recall during the course of their lives.Time passes in the film and we leave the boys as youths and rediscover them as young men. A visiting Norman has returned home in the 1920's, having completed college in the east. Paul is now a somewhat infamous regional newspaperman, who uses his articles to skewer corrupt local figures in business and politics. Where Norman is every bit as staid and responsible as his childhood hinted he would grow to be, Paul is a hard-drinking charmer whose fondness for high-stakes poker games in frontier saloons and nights out with the wilder of the local women stands at odds with his upbringing in the respected Maclean household. During the summer that follows Norman's homecoming after graduation, he and his brother and father once again return to the river and fly fish, Norman finds love with a beautiful girl from a neighboring town, and the entire Maclean family watches as Paul slowly destroys himself in a fast life he cannot seem to leave alone. The film tells the kind of engrossing, touching story that very few cinematic works do, and is one of the crowning jewels of modern motion picture achievement. A River Runs Through It is at times funny, at others profound, throughout it radiates its quality, and ultimately...And ultimately I hope anyone reading this will see this great film for him or her self.",5,One of The One-Hundred Greatest Films Ever Made,1159228800,"09 26, 2006",2006,2622,"['River', 'Runs', 'difficult', 'film', 'review', 'even', 'fairly', 'comment', 'beautifully-filmed', 'overflowing', 'sort', 'natural', 'scenery', '-thick', 'dark', 'forests', 'cold', 'free-flowing', 'rivers', 'wide-open', 'skies', '-that', 'most', 'movies', 'would', 'steal', 'show', 'also', 'cast', 'actors', 'Tom', 'Skerit', 'Emily', 'Lloyd', 'Craig', 'Sheffer', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'giving', 'what', 'will', 'long', 'remain', 'convinced', 'most', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'careers', 'classic', '1991', 'motion', 'picture', 're-', 'true', 'story', 'writer', 'Norman', 'Maclean', 'youth', 'early', 'adulthood', 'nearly', 'century', 'ago', 'wilds', 'rural', 'Montana', 'Norman', 'deep', 'pensive', 'person', 'many', 'ways', 'opposite', 'younger', 'brother', 'Paul', 'free-spirited', 'daredevil', 'adventurous', 'nature', 'good-hearted', 'perilous', 'everyone', 'Paul', 'see', 'Norman', 'Paul', 'father', 'upstanding', 'Presbyterian', 'minister', 'scholarly', 'erudition', 'sternly', 'eloquent', 'sermons', 'give', 'way', 'frequent', 'intervals', 'undertaking', 'great', 'passion', 'life', 'fly', 'fishing', 'Reverend', 'Maclean', 'nothing', 'more', 'take', 'sons', 'river', 'fly', 'fish', 'trout', 'trips', 'elder', 'Maclean', 'life', 'lessons', 'boys', 'passes', 'words', 'wisdom', 'will', 'go', 'recall', 'course', 'lives.Time', 'passes', 'film', 'leave', 'boys', 'youths', 'rediscover', 'young', 'men', 'visiting', 'Norman', 'returned', 'home', '1920', 'having', 'completed', 'college', 'east', 'Paul', 'now', 'somewhat', 'infamous', 'regional', 'newspaperman', 'who', 'articles', 'skewer', 'corrupt', 'local', 'figures', 'business', 'politics', 'Where', 'Norman', 'bit', 'staid', 'responsible', 'childhood', 'hinted', 'would', 'grow', 'be', 'Paul', 'hard-drinking', 'charmer', 'fondness', 'high-stakes', 'poker', 'games', 'frontier', 'saloons', 'nights', 'out', 'wilder', 'local', 'women', 'odds', 'upbringing', 'respected', 'Maclean', 'household', 'summer', 'Norman', 'homecoming', 'graduation', 'brother', 'father', 'once', 'again', 'return', 'river', 'fly', 'fish', 'Norman', 'love', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'neighboring', 'town', 'entire', 'Maclean', 'family', 'watches', 'Paul', 'slowly', 'fast', 'life', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'leave', 'alone', 'film', 'kind', 'engrossing', 'touching', 'story', 'very', 'few', 'cinematic', 'works', 'do', 'one', 'crowning', 'jewels', 'modern', 'motion', 'picture', 'achievement', 'River', 'Runs', 'times', 'funny', 'others', 'profound', 'quality', 'ultimately', 'ultimately', 'hope', 'anyone', 'reading', 'will', 'see', 'great', 'film', 'self']",A River Runs Through It

All three are passionate about fly-fishing to the extent that it becomes a form of worship for them.  As the years go by, the family begins to grow apart as the older brother makes a life for himself in another part of the country and the younger brother, though remaining close to home, drifts away from his spiritual upbringing into a life of gambling and alcohol.  Yet they always have fly-fishing, a bond that allows them to periodically and temporarily reestablish the closeness that has been lost.  This film is very interesting and moving in the way it portrays the tension between the reality of children establishing their own lives away from their parents and the resulting sorrow and nostalgia over the weakening of familial bonds.

21340,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,0767836359,Get What We Give,"[3, 3]","Once upon a time, Hollywood made &quot;films, &quot; and some of these films became the epitdome of art.  That talent has all but been forgotten in an era where imagination takes a back seat to the obvious.  There used to be a clamor for fine directors and actors who could convey the thoughts and feelings of an author or screenwriter without the use of nudity or foul language.  They used to make films without explosions and blood and gore.  And those films used to be AND still are better than most anything that Hollywood cranks out today.Enter &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot; directed by Robert Redford.  This film is a quiet character study that has  brilliance in the acting and directing.  This is so apparent that you'll find your emotions welling up in you as you watch it.  It is such a delicately made film that you'll need to watch it multiple times to understand that the director and actors aren't going to spell out what you should be feeling.  They aren't going to speak every emotion they're having - you're going to have to surmise those for yourself.  This is so NOT like the films Hollywood makes today.  It's a subtle, beautiful film.Brad Pitt may have made a mark in the public's collective memory when he appeared shirtless in &quot;Thelma and Louise&quot;, but in &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot; he shows his chops and in doing so, let's us know he is an exceedingly talented actor not just a pretty boy.Craig Sheffer (has the lead in this film and does a phenomenal job of giving us a young man living with the painful knowledge that he must forever live in the shadow of his younger brother, Paul (Pitt).  Though, Norman (Sheffer) is the reliable touchstone, Paul has a remarkable brightness of light that encompasses him.Paul is the opposite of Norman emotionally, but they share a common familial bond and a love of fly fishing in the Missoula River.  They are able to work out their differences while they fish.  Theirs is a relationship that doesn't depend on words, but rather on understanding.A River Runs Through It is not unlike the story of the prodigal child, nor is it too far removed to be able to be compared to Elia Kazan's &quot;East of Eden&quot;.  It, too, was an intelligent film that didn't spell everything out for the viewer.The story revolves around Norman and Paul as they grow up in Montana with their minister father and loving mother in the 1920's.  Montana, itself, is a character in this film, as Redford shows us its majesty and grandeur without making it feel like a travelogue.At once, funny and poignant and heart rending, A River Runs Through It tells us the quiet story of the two brothers growing into manhood and getting on with their lives.  It doesn't have car crashes and there's no gratuitous nudity.  The script doesn't rely on the screenwriter having a hampered vocabulary, thus forcing him to use expletives instead of true dialogue.No, A River Runs Through It depends on talent.  Talent from the book it was based on - talent from the screenwriter - talent from the director - and finally, talent from the fine cast of actors.After watching this film, I doubt you'll be able to understand why it didn't take every award that Hollywood doles out.It doesn't get much better than this.",5,'Ansel Adams meets Elia Kazan' in this awesome film!,1070928000,"12 9, 2003",2003,3262,"['Once', 'time', 'Hollywood', 'made', 'quot', 'films', 'quot', 'films', 'became', 'epitdome', 'art', 'talent', 'been', 'forgotten', 'era', 'where', 'imagination', 'back', 'seat', 'obvious', 'used', 'be', 'clamor', 'fine', 'directors', 'actors', 'who', 'could', 'convey', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'author', 'screenwriter', 'use', 'nudity', 'foul', 'language', 'used', 'make', 'films', 'explosions', 'blood', 'gore', 'films', 'used', 'be', 'AND', 'still', 'are', 'better', 'most', 'anything', 'Hollywood', 'out', 'today.Enter', 'quot', 'A', 'River', 'Runs', 'quot', 'directed', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'film', 'quiet', 'character', 'study', 'brilliance', 'acting', 'directing', 'so', 'apparent', ""'ll"", 'find', 'emotions', 'welling', 'up', 'watch', 'such', 'delicately', 'made', 'film', ""'ll"", 'need', 'watch', 'multiple', 'times', 'understand', 'director', 'actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'spell', 'out', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'feeling', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'speak', 'emotion', ""'re"", 'having', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'surmise', 'so', 'NOT', 'films', 'Hollywood', 'today', 'subtle', 'beautiful', 'film.Brad', 'Pitt', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'mark', 'public', 'collective', 'memory', 'when', 'appeared', 'shirtless', 'quot', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'quot', 'quot', 'A', 'River', 'Runs', 'quot', 'chops', 'doing', 'so', 'let', 'know', 'exceedingly', 'talented', 'actor', 'not', 'just', 'pretty', 'boy.Craig', 'Sheffer', 'lead', 'film', 'phenomenal', 'job', 'giving', 'young', 'man', 'living', 'painful', 'knowledge', 'must', 'forever', 'live', 'shadow', 'younger', 'brother', 'Paul', 'Pitt', 'Though', 'Norman', 'Sheffer', 'reliable', 'touchstone', 'Paul', 'remarkable', 'brightness', 'light', 'him.Paul', 'opposite', 'Norman', 'emotionally', 'share', 'common', 'familial', 'bond', 'love', 'fly', 'fishing', 'Missoula', 'River', 'are', 'able', 'work', 'out', 'differences', 'fish', 'Theirs', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'depend', 'words', 'rather', 'understanding.A', 'River', 'Runs', 'not', 'story', 'prodigal', 'child', 'too', 'far', 'removed', 'be', 'able', 'be', 'compared', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'quot', 'East', 'Eden', 'quot', 'too', 'was', 'intelligent', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'spell', 'everything', 'out', 'viewer.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'Norman', 'Paul', 'grow', 'up', 'Montana', 'minister', 'father', 'loving', 'mother', '1920', 'Montana', 'character', 'film', 'Redford', 'majesty', 'grandeur', 'making', 'feel', 'travelogue.At', 'once', 'funny', 'poignant', 'heart', 'rending', 'A', 'River', 'Runs', 'quiet', 'story', 'two', 'brothers', 'growing', 'manhood', 'getting', 'lives', ""n't"", 'have', 'car', 'crashes', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'script', ""n't"", 'rely', 'screenwriter', 'having', 'hampered', 'vocabulary', 'thus', 'forcing', 'use', 'expletives', 'instead', 'true', 'dialogue.No', 'A', 'River', 'Runs', 'talent', 'Talent', 'book', 'was', 'based', 'talent', 'screenwriter', 'talent', 'director', 'finally', 'talent', 'fine', 'cast', 'actors.After', 'watching', 'film', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'understand', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'award', 'Hollywood', 'out.It', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'better']",A River Runs Through It

I had this on DVD, this was an upgrade to Blu-ray. I don't know what has happened to Amazon's free (non-expedited) shipping, but it's gone from being very good last year to being abysmal. In general, it can take a week or more before they are even shipped, and then they use shippers like Lasership or USPS (USPS? hey, there's a reason why they've been gradually going out of business!)- no real tracking for USPS (the only time they can tell you anything specific is after the shipment has been delivered, and even that is not accurate). On one occasion, my order shipped part way by UPS, who then handed it off to USPS for the last few miles of delivery. After that, USPS 'lost' my order, and I had to file a claim and wait even longer for it to be settled. I don't know why Amazon thinks this is the right way to treat their customers- how much to they save and is it really worth it to PO their customers to save a few extra cents? All of my shipments used to arrive in 3-5 days like clockwork... now it takes 1-1/2 to 2 weeks for delivery on average, and in some cases over a month.

Packer,"[12, 14]","Any director can fill a screen with pretty things and call it beautiful, just as any writer can fill a page with words and call it poetry.  Those who have not yet been deluded into believing in total relativism know, however, how difficult true beauty and true poetry are to create.  Greatness in film, like greatness in poetry, requires hard work, and that work comes to little unless it is inflamed with a divine light.A River Runs Through it is a work of great beauty and true poetry.  It is a film that I believe is destined to become a significant part of our national heritage, and in the long run I also believe that it is the most significant work for which Robert Redford will be remembered (not to take anything away from his other excellent work.)  During his time here on earth, it would appear that he has been fortunate enough to attain something resembling wisdom, and all of it is communicated in the exquisitely simple, yet divinely inspired, way in which this film gives us these characters and this story.Having also read Norman MacLean's books, I will mention that this film is an ""adaptation"" of his story of the same title.  It is, however, that rarest of adaptations in that it gives up nothing to the original, and does it full and complete justice in every way that matters.With each viewing of this film over the years, its profound use of symbolism and metaphor becomes ever more apparent to me.  It is truly a family story in that it revolves around the universal themes of sibling rivalry, parental tribulation, the tenuous beginnings (and deep foundations) of love and the seemingly random but somehow inevitable movements of the hand of fate.  You don't need to be a fisherman or have any interest in fly fishing to be deeply moved by this film; you simply need to be a human being.In closing, I would like to beg Mr. Redford for a digitally remastered and restored director's cut in widescreen on DVD with an interview with him as a special feature.

If you haven't, read the summary above and then read this because I won't repeat the storyline.Just as the Godfather is more about family than it is about gangsters, A River Runs Through It is more than about fly fishing. I was thinking it may be about Grace, as in having a state of grace about one's and one's own loved ones destinies. Why is it that the people who need our help the most, refuse to accept it"" asks Jessie. I couldn't think of an answer. In reading the reviews of the book and later the movie by critics from the Northeast, I found myself asking why they seemed to miss the whole point of the movie. One reason might be one of scale. The east is small and crowded and I think the people living there prefer to place people into easily definable boxes-""liberal"" ""right wing conservative"" ""jew"" ""black"" ""hick"" etc. Easterners think small. The West on the other hand is big. The land is open, the mountains, rivers and lakes are big and the people are open in their thinking and in how they choose to live their lives. Norman believes he can be a great fisherman, a boxer in college and a intellectual. He doesn't limit himself. Paul defines himself more narrowly but wanting to grow up to be a professional fly fisherman and when that doesn't pan out, does the next best thing by finding a job where most of his time is his own, leaving plenty of time to fish. Eastern critics can't, I believe"" imagine such a place.

The time is the 1900's - 1920's.Two brothers, very different in temperament and aspirations love to fly fish with their father, a Presbyterian minister.  The older brother, bookish Norman (Craig Sheffer), does all the usual and expected things of a minister's son.  He is the scholarly more rigid son.  The younger brother Paul (Brad Pitt) is bold and daring.  He likes to take chances and have emotions run wild.  He becomes a journalist for a local newspaper - enjoys each day and pushes the line, but loves his family too.These two very different brothers are the focus of the story.  They love to fly fish, and enjoy this one sport with their strict but loving father.  Norman comes home from college and sees his brother's life become unraveled by the usual sins of gambling, wild women and drinking.This is a very strong artful movie that shows not only the power of family, but life, love and nature tied together by fly-fishing.",5,Masterpiece of Love and Fly-Fishing!,1253836800,"09 25, 2009",2009,1180,"['Set', 'beautiful', 'scenic', 'Montana', 'Bitterroot', 'River', 'movie', 'based', 'Norman', 'Maclean', 'much-loved', 'autobiography', 'family', 'human', 'nature', 'fly', 'fishing', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'deep', 'understanding', 'book', 'area', 'time', '1900', ""1920's.Two"", 'brothers', 'very', 'different', 'temperament', 'aspirations', 'love', 'fly', 'fish', 'father', 'Presbyterian', 'minister', 'older', 'brother', 'bookish', 'Norman', 'Craig', 'Sheffer', 'usual', 'expected', 'things', 'minister', 'son', 'scholarly', 'more', 'rigid', 'son', 'younger', 'brother', 'Paul', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'bold', 'daring', 'take', 'chances', 'have', 'emotions', 'run', 'wild', 'journalist', 'local', 'newspaper', 'day', 'line', 'family', 'too.These', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'brothers', 'are', 'focus', 'story', 'love', 'fly', 'fish', 'enjoy', 'one', 'sport', 'strict', 'loving', 'father', 'Norman', 'home', 'college', 'brother', 'life', 'become', 'unraveled', 'usual', 'sins', 'gambling', 'wild', 'women', 'drinking.This', 'very', 'strong', 'artful', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'power', 'family', 'life', 'love', 'nature', 'tied', 'together', 'fly-fishing']",A River Runs Through It

At age 70 MacLean, with his first book, produced what was immediately hailed as an American classic. Like many people, when I learned that Robert Redford was making the movie I eagerly awaited its debut. I don't think the fans will be disappointed as it's a wonderful movie that truly does justice to MacLean's understated but superbly crafted novel.The story follows two brothers who are very different as they grow up from boys into men and embark on the paths their lives will ultimately take. Norman is the responsible older brother: serious, disciplined, and scholarly, he goes off to college at Dartmouth for six years, coming back home to marry and then accepting a job at the University of Chicago (where my father coincidentally went to school). Paul is the rebellious, devil-may-care younger brother, whose bouts of drinking and gambling eventually lead to tragedy. But in the film he achieves the greatest skill as a fly-fisherman, elevating it, in his brother's words, to that of an art.In describing fly fishing and the Big Blackfoot River MacLean's normally lean, taut, and unassuming prose becomes truly lyrical and poetic. Throughout the movie the activity of fly fishing brings together and bonds the two brothers and father, who, although very different people, are united by their common love of fly fishing. Ultimately fly fishing becomes a metaphor for that which transcends ordinary reality in their everyday lives, with Paul being the one who truly elevates it to a high art. In that sense he symbolizes the brilliant but tragic artist who dies before his time.The film reunited Tom Skerrit and Redford (who narrates it without a credit) who both debuted in the 1962 movie, ""War Hunt."" Phillipe Rousselot's stunning cinematography (who won an Oscar for this film) captures the beauty of the Montana countryside.

That is, they share their concern with a beloved family member who is destroying himself.  What a basis for a marriage!

It is set in 1920s Montana, a land that still had some of the Old West left, and as the story says, ""a land with dew still on it...""  The real star of the story is Montana itself, and this film I think fully captures the flavor of that place in those times.  The cinamatography of this film is very good, and gives the viewer an appreciation of the natural beauty of the state.The basic theme of the story is the maturation of two brothers, and their relationship with their stern, Presbyterian minister father.  One brother is level-headed, destined for a life of teaching and achievement.  The other brother, equally precocious, is seduced by his love of gambling and drinking to the point where his life becomes corrupt.  As his father says, sometimes those who need our help do not want it, and indeed do not wish to be helped.  The common bond between the brothers and their father is fly fishing in the great trout rivers of Montana, and this makes for a wonderful backdrop to a very interesting storyline.  The interaction between these protagonists is a fascinating interplay of personalities, and (although you may not know it from this review) the storyline of this film moves along briskly, and keeps the viewer's interest.Although I usually don't like films that feature a narration, this one is an exception.  Robert Redford (who has no other role in the film) does a fine job narrating the film from the standpoint of Norman Mclain, one of the two brothers.The DVD is crisp and clear, and constitutes a good value.

Yet, despite its lack of event, this nostalgic recollection through one man's memories is a beautiful cinematograph of experience and family values.At the very least, you'll remember its stunning landscapes for a long time, particularly the powerful and majestic ""Blackfoot River"" captured immaculately by the same cinematographer as Dangerous Liaisons. Montana must be a pretty state!Robert Redford's voiceover narration in his silken voice is calm, allowing the poetry of Norman Maclean's written words to carry the emotion: ""Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it.""What piqued my attention was its subtheme of the passion for a pursuit -- fly fishing in this case, which is an intrigue to me in itself. As the fishing lines flick and whisk over the whispering river, a low sun sheening the tree-lined horizon, the rhythm of image embraces imagination and meditation. We are close to understanding what Norman means when he says he is ""haunted by waters"".By the time the film comes to its lyrically elegiac end, it has touched your heart and made you think.

No. It does show why fly fishing is worth pursuing or why Montana may indeed be a nice place to visit or that all young men should grab a hot native chick off of a reservation and get thrown in jail with her.Legends of the Fall is infinitely better in every single aspect than this little annoyance if you're into Pitt and the whole Bad Brother routine.You know people who love to have coffee table books around, or Marxist dialectical imperative pamphlets lying around that they pretend to read?

They managed to put together a nice overall package for any fan of this movie and the Blu quality made for a convincing demo to those that had seen the other two DVD releases of this.The picture quality came across with solid vibrancy, clarity and saturation. There are plenty of chances for there to be obvious artifact (with all of the sky shots and skin close-ups) but they did a competent removal throughout. If there is any significant doubt as to what the original product looked like - be sure to watch the deleted scenes for the before and after. The sound was better than I was setting the bar for as I am not a fan of TrueHD and how bad some of the vocals turn out. Not a benchmark test for 1990s surround films, but I was pleased.The supplements are thorough for any fan, and include:* The 30 minute making-of filled with plenty of background, interviews, excerpts and tidbits of information.* The Blackout Challenge, Rescuing a River: A 15 minute mix of ecological, environmental and personal story info about the river and saving it for the future.* Casting a Line: A 6 minute guide on how to start fly fishing, there were actually a few kids that watched this part and seemed interested.* Deleted Scenes: 17 cut/modified scenes totaling 16 minutes. A few bland, a few interesting - but what it showcases the most is how the film stock looked years ago and how great it looks in this version.* On The Blackfoot River 1080 Loops: Exclusive to the BD. They contain a looped 1080 view, that is selectable by the user between a ""Rushing River"", ""Rocky Mt"", ""Big Sky Country"" and ""Forest Bend"". All of them have background scores by the film's composer (able to turn that on/off). They all looked and sounded adequate, and the best thing out of them would be the 5.1 mix of water and insect sounds; maybe one of those screen saver moments to have on the display for background and such.The book has 34 glossy pages of information about the film, the actors and fly fishing. I scanned a couple of them to give an idea of what to expect should you be sitting on the fence about spending the money for this version.

Now, watching it again, I realise just how much the filmmakers have achieved in capturing the spirit of Norman Maclean's novella describing his life growing up in rural Montana in the early years of the twentieth century.The casting is excellent, with a career-defining role for Brad Pitt.  It's almost as if the director has taken the author's description of Paul, ""he was beautiful"" at face value.  Playing opposite him, Craig Sheffer makes a suitably stiff-necked contribution as his elder sibling.I also liked Emily Lloyd's performance as Norman's future wife Jesse.  Strangely, she isn't refered to on the cover of the DVD, whereas Brenda Blethyn, who has far less screen time, takes joint billing.  I guess this just reflects the older actress's higher profile.This film has so much to offer: flawless scenery and costumes, wonderful casting and fine acting.  You also get the added bonus of Clint Eastwood's narrating.  Yet I'm not sure that it will capture the imagination (or at times even make much sense) to people who haven't read the book.

21421,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,0767836359,Themis-Athena,"[55, 61]","I don't think anybody who has ever visited the American West, particularly the north-western states of Montana and Wyoming, hasn't come away deeply impressed with the majestic beauty of their mountains, rivers, streams, endless skies, prairies and meadows.  Many probably went home to find that the photos they took, trying to immortalize their impressions, just didn't seem to do justice to the real thing, and wishing they possessed the craft to adequately capture the region's beauty in images, whether literary or visual.  Robert Redford has succeeded to combine words and pictures in this stunning adaptation of Norman Maclean's 1976 autobiographical novella ""A River Runs Through It.""Set in early 20th century rural Montana, this is the coming-of-age story of the author and his brother Paul, sons of a Scottish Presbyterian minister who raised them with both love and sternness and instilled in them, more than anything else, an understanding for the divine beauty of their land, symbolized by and culminating in a fly fisherman's skill in casting his rod, and his ability to become one with the river in which he fishes.  For, in Norman Maclean's words, in their family ""there was no clear line between religion and fly fishing;"" and growing up, the brothers came to believe quite naturally that Jesus's disciples themselves must have been fly fishermen, too; and that consequently every good fly fisherman is closer to the divine than any other human.But while they were united by their love for their native land and its rivers and fish, the brothers couldn't have been any more different on a personal level.  And thus, this is also a story of brotherly (and parental) love and loss, of the inability to communicate, and of dreams and aspirations nurtured and fatally disappointed.  While disciplined, sensible Norman (Craig Sheffer) left Montana for a six-year college education at Dartmouth and ultimately - after having temporarily returned home and taken a bride - to assume a teaching position at the University of Chicago, rebellious Paul (Brad Pitt in a truly career-defining role) knew that he would never leave his home state and ""the fish he had not yet caught;"" and opted for a journalist's life instead.  But ultimately he wasn't able to fight the demons that possessed him; and his parents and brother had to stand by and helplessly watch him embark on a path of self-destruction, reduced to comments on symbolic matters like Paul's decision to change the spelling of their last name by capitalizing the ""L"" (""Now everybody will think we are Lowland Scots,"" scorned their father), where to open topicalize their concerns would have destroyed the careful equilibrium of mutual respect, love, hope, caution and guardedness characterizing their relationship.  And so, only after Paul's death could his father tell a hesitant Norman that he knew more about his brother than the fact that Paul had been a fine fisherman: ""He was beautiful"" - and mourn in a sermon, even later, that all too frequently, when looking at a loved one in need, ""either we don't know what part of ourselves to give or, more often than not, the part we have to give is not wanted.  And so it is those we live with and should know who elude us.  But we can still love them.  We can love completely, without complete understanding.""Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt are perfectly cast as the earnest, reasonable Norman and his maverick brother Paul, who relies on his innate toughness in his fateful attempt to take life to its limits and still beat the devil, but who also turns the casting of a fishing line into an art form that makes a rainbow rise from the water, and who with his greatest-ever catch stands before his father and brother ""suspended above the earth, free from all its laws, like a work of art.""  Moreover, this movie reunited Robert Redford with Tom Skerritt, with whom he had first shared the screen in the 1962 Korean war drama ""War Hunt"" (both actors' big-screen debut), and who gives a finely-tuned, sensitive performance as the Reverend Maclean.  Notable are also the appearances of Brenda Blethyn as Mrs. Maclean and Emily Lloyd as Norman's bride-to-be Jessie.  But the movie's true star is Montana itself, particularly its rivers and streams; every frame of Philippe Rousselot's Academy Award-winning cinematography and every sweep of the camera over Montana's magnificent landscape, and along the silver bands of its rivers with their gurgling cataracts and waves curling softly against their banks, powerful testimony to Robert Redford's genuine love and respect for the West and for nature in general; the causes closest to his heart and matched in importance only by his efforts to promote a movie scene outside of Hollywood.  And Redford himself assumes the (uncredited) role of the narrator, thus bringing to the screen Norman Maclean's lyrical language and uniting words and pictures in an audiovisual sonnet, subtly accentuated by Mark Isham's gentle score.Both movie and novella end with the lines that have given the story its title:  ""[I]n the half-light of the canyon, all existence fades to a being with my soul; and memories, and the sounds of the Big Blackfoot River, and a four-count rhythm, and the hope that a fish will rise.  Eventually, all things merge into one; and a river runs through it.  The river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. On some of the rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs"" - those of Norman Maclean's now-lost loved ones; those he ""loved and did not understand in [his] youth.""  As we have had to learn, it is not only human life that is terminal; even nature itself (including, incidentally, the Macleans' beloved Big Blackfoot River) is not immune to destruction by human carelessness.  This movie is a powerful plea to all of us not to wait until it has become too late.Also recommended:A River Runs through It and Other Stories, Twenty-fifth Anniversary EditionThe Norman Maclean

Jamison""","[5, 11]","Yes the movie is filmed in beautiful Montana - though I do not recall any winter scenes and those must be part of what formed young boys growing up there. Equally cold should be the religious view. This is somewhat reflected in the house. It can be especially seen in the contrast between the family of the future bride (why not see the wedding?) Methodists (""Baptists that can read"") and that of the groom - Presbyterians. This might have played out somewhat like the contrast between families in ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"". But this does not seem to be the main point. The main contrast is between brothers. Suppose the one has religion and the other has fishing. One becomes a professor: the news sends mom into a most embarrassing explosion of joy. The other wants to be a professional fly fisherman - but there is no such profession. This frustration leads to the conflict in Paul who clearly is not full of joy with anything else he does. Booze and a wonderfully though too briefly developed character of an Indian woman - (if only she could have played a bigger role in more ways than one!) are all that keep Paul from the deep end - even Presidents don't consider fishing with enough seriousness. ""What are you going to catch them with?"" ""The end of my line."" Fishing might hold all the answers - especially if you listen to the voices under the rocks - but society demands something more and Paul can not manage this. For any parent that worries about losing one - or several - how do you know they are saved? - this is a mortal dilemma. Yes, we can love them completely even without understanding, but is this a flaw in Presbyterianism? Is that a sufficiently emotional religious connection with the divine in man? Baptists lose some of their own too - and to the same things. ""Why do the ones who need help the most refuse to take the help they are offered?"" (I am sure I did not get that quote correctly but it is close...) Good question.On a lighter note, my wife and I argued over whether or not this is a ""chick flick"" or not.
