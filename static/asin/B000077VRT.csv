Danny looks like a chipmonk, and Jack is not fit for the role(he looks like an ugly girl on the cover). The film is too long, and cannot be compared to the classic version with Jack Nicholson. This movie was pretty low-budget if you ask me, and dont listen to any of the good reviews. Rent the older one, and you'll be more pleased with youre choice.

724772,A2C0X7WOIHNFTX,B000077VRT,Anthony J Novak,"[6, 7]","There have been two adaptations of Stephen King's book--the classic Stanley Kubrick movie and this recent TV miniseries directed by Mick Garris (The Stand).The miniseries is very faithful to the book and is a little long because of it (4 and 1/2 hours).  What's great about the miniseries (and one of the ways it tops the original) is that it builds tension and mystery slowly.  In the Kubrick version, Jack Nicholson is crazy from scene one.  In this miniseries, you get to watch Jack Torrance (played quite well in the miniseries by Steven Weber) slowly lose his mind.  I really got wrapped into the story, and the miniseries maintains the tragic tone that was so resonant in the book.The problem with the miniseries, however, is that the climax (Jack Torrance attempting to kill his family) doesn't work as well as the Kubrick movie.  In fact, it pales in comparison.  The climax is too drawn out, and it doesn't have the excitement and sheer terror of the Kubrick movie.  Still, it is a good movie, and by TV standards, it's pretty good.The DVD includes two main features--deleted scenes and a commentary (by Weber, Garris, and King himself).  The deleted scenes--like most other DVD deleted scenes--are nothing special.  The commentary is great though.  Weber is pretty good.  And Garris provides good insight and antecdotes.  The real treat though is King, who is funny, animated, extremely humble, and very smart.  The commentary is worth checking out if you buy the DVD.",4,Good But Overlong Adaptation,1154476800,"08 2, 2006",2006,1478,"['have', 'been', 'two', 'adaptations', 'Stephen', 'King', 'book', 'classic', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'movie', 'recent', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'directed', 'Mick', 'Garris', 'Stand', '.The', 'miniseries', 'very', 'faithful', 'book', 'little', 'long', '4', '1/2', 'hours', 'What', 'great', 'miniseries', 'one', 'ways', 'original', 'tension', 'mystery', 'slowly', 'Kubrick', 'version', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'crazy', 'scene', 'one', 'miniseries', 'get', 'watch', 'Jack', 'Torrance', 'played', 'quite', 'well', 'miniseries', 'Steven', 'Weber', 'slowly', 'lose', 'mind', 'really', 'got', 'wrapped', 'story', 'miniseries', 'tragic', 'tone', 'was', 'so', 'resonant', 'book.The', 'problem', 'miniseries', 'however', 'climax', 'Jack', 'Torrance', 'attempting', 'kill', 'family', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'well', 'Kubrick', 'movie', 'fact', 'comparison', 'climax', 'too', 'drawn', 'out', ""n't"", 'have', 'excitement', 'sheer', 'terror', 'Kubrick', 'movie', 'Still', 'good', 'movie', 'TV', 'standards', 'pretty', 'good.The', 'DVD', 'two', 'main', 'features', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'Weber', 'Garris', 'King', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'most', 'other', 'DVD', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'nothing', 'special', 'commentary', 'great', 'Weber', 'pretty', 'good', 'Garris', 'good', 'insight', 'antecdotes', 'real', 'treat', 'King', 'who', 'funny', 'animated', 'extremely', 'humble', 'very', 'smart', 'commentary', 'checking', 'out', 'buy', 'DVD']",Stephen King's The Shining

724774,A28MUB6792Y8VD,B000077VRT,Arthur E. Hancock,"[9, 14]","I would like to address the individuals who said this version was better than Kubrick's.  I personnally am the biggest fan of Steven King's novels on the planet, but how true a film is to a book has nothing to do with how good a film actually is.  Film and Literature are two completely different forms of media. Anyone can make a retread or carbon copy of a book, but it won't be very entertaining.  Stanley Kubrick's version of the Shining is better and I'll tell you why.  Kubrick(the greatest director/artist to ever live) felt no need to over explain every single detail(which is fine to do on the page) about what's going on, which made his film much more eerie.  Also, he used a lot of FILMAKING techniques such as sound, stunning and expansive camera shots and angles, and superb acting which all created a creepy feeling. He had an eye and saw things other people didn't.  This is called ""being a talented film-maker"".  This TV remake is the work of a director who simply wanted to tell the story, but who had no eye for how to do that his own way or how to do it visually.  The acting is also horrible compared to the original which tends to be distracring at times, not to mention the overuse of horrible special effects in this remake that Kubrick had no need for.  If you check out a list of what are considered the greatest movies ever made, most of them were movies that were nothing like the books they were based on.",2,"Good storytelling, Bad Filmaking",1111449600,"03 22, 2005",2005,1433,"['would', 'like', 'address', 'individuals', 'who', 'said', 'version', 'was', 'better', 'Kubrick', 'personnally', 'am', 'biggest', 'fan', 'Steven', 'King', 'novels', 'planet', 'how', 'true', 'film', 'book', 'nothing', 'do', 'how', 'good', 'film', 'actually', 'Film', 'Literature', 'are', 'two', 'completely', 'different', 'forms', 'media', 'Anyone', 'can', 'make', 'retread', 'carbon', 'copy', 'book', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'very', 'entertaining', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'version', 'Shining', 'better', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'why', 'Kubrick', 'greatest', 'director/artist', 'ever', 'live', 'felt', 'need', 'over', 'explain', 'single', 'detail', 'fine', 'do', 'page', 'what', 'going', 'made', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'eerie', 'Also', 'used', 'lot', 'FILMAKING', 'techniques', 'such', 'sound', 'stunning', 'expansive', 'camera', 'shots', 'angles', 'superb', 'acting', 'created', 'creepy', 'feeling', 'had', 'eye', 'saw', 'things', 'other', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'called', 'being', 'talented', 'film-maker', 'TV', 'remake', 'work', 'director', 'who', 'simply', 'wanted', 'tell', 'story', 'who', 'had', 'eye', 'how', 'do', 'own', 'way', 'how', 'do', 'visually', 'acting', 'also', 'horrible', 'compared', 'original', 'be', 'distracring', 'times', 'not', 'mention', 'overuse', 'horrible', 'special', 'effects', 'remake', 'Kubrick', 'had', 'need', 'check', 'out', 'list', 'what', 'are', 'considered', 'greatest', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'most', 'were', 'movies', 'were', 'nothing', 'books', 'were', 'based']",Stephen King's The Shining

724784,ATWTE9KHND8K8,B000077VRT,CJ,"[2, 4]","Let's get one thing out of the way---this movie isn't in the same universe as Kubrick's masterpiece (also Nicholson's masterpiece), and I wouldn't expect a TV movie to measure up to such an acknowledged classic. Kubrick's reworking of King's The Shining is superior to the original in my opinion on a similar level as Hendrix's version of All Along the Watch Tower compared to Bob's---no contest at all! But that doesn't mean this should be missed for fans for the story.  Fans of the book in particular are sure to be very interested in this version, which follows it closely and answers many questions left untouched by Kubrick's version. I am a fanatical fan of Kubrick's movie and have seen it many times over the years, but I must confess, I have not yet read the book.  The TV version gives me a strong taste of what I would find in the book, and frankly, I prefer Kubrick's vision for this story, at least when it comes to translating it to the silver screen.  Of course, he was greatly aided by the wonderfully maniacal Jack Nicholson at just the right time in his life to play this part, but Kubrick hit a grand slam that makes the TV version irrelevant for casual fans.  However, I am not a mere casual fan, so I knew I would have to view the TV version.  Overall, I came away somewhat disappointed, but I don't regret buying it and would do it again.  It's simply not something I will cherish over the years and watch again and again the way I do just about every winter with Kubrick's, a yearly ritual!Although Stephen Weber did a very admirable job considering the challenge he was presented with and is the best part of the movie, face it, it is impossible to avoid comparing him to Jack Nicholson. And when you do that, Weber comes up very short. He is already typecast in my mind as the goofy younger brother from Wings and the direction was simply not at the same artistic level as Kubrick's.  I found the kid VERY annoying as well, which alone would have been the final nail in the coffin for this one. None of the other characters were particularly interesting, either. I think a very, very talented person/team could produce a movie that follows the book closely and is much more disturbing than this one, but the result here simply misses the mark. The moving hedge animals were absurd. If they had only appeared to move when a character looked away, maybe, but to actually show it happening? Again, the curse of CGI tempting movie makers to show things that are better implied.I give bonus points for filming at the actual Stanley Hotel which inspired King to write The Shining. Very cool to see that. But again, I find Kubrick's Overlook Hotel even more interesting. And there is no comparing the musical scores either.  From the very first scene of Kubrick's version, you can feel chills as Jack Torrence's car makes its way into the gigantic mountains accompanied by utterly creepy music, which is a welcome companion throughout.  There are no equivalent chills in the entire TV movie. And the TV movie does not accomplish the sense of desolation....madness....Cabin Fever. These are really the most fascinating elements to me. The final slap to the face of the TV version is the mercilessly sappy ending, which unravels all of the tension of the final hours in a very weak fashion.I'll put it this way, if Kubrick's movie had never existed, I think there would be very little discussion in popular culture at this point of either the book or the TV movie.",3,Worth seeing at least once,1348963200,"09 30, 2012",2012,3481,"['Let', 'get', 'one', 'thing', 'way', '-this', 'movie', ""n't"", 'same', 'universe', 'Kubrick', 'masterpiece', 'also', 'Nicholson', 'masterpiece', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'TV', 'movie', 'measure', 'up', 'acknowledged', 'classic', 'Kubrick', 'reworking', 'King', 'Shining', 'superior', 'original', 'opinion', 'similar', 'level', 'Hendrix', 'version', 'All', 'Along', 'Watch', 'Tower', 'compared', 'Bob', '-no', 'contest', ""n't"", 'mean', 'should', 'be', 'missed', 'fans', 'story', 'Fans', 'book', 'particular', 'are', 'sure', 'be', 'very', 'interested', 'version', 'closely', 'answers', 'many', 'questions', 'left', 'untouched', 'Kubrick', 'version', 'am', 'fanatical', 'fan', 'Kubrick', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'years', 'must', 'confess', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'read', 'book', 'TV', 'version', 'strong', 'taste', 'what', 'would', 'find', 'book', 'frankly', 'prefer', 'Kubrick', 'vision', 'story', 'least', 'when', 'translating', 'silver', 'screen', 'course', 'was', 'greatly', 'aided', 'wonderfully', 'maniacal', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'just', 'right', 'time', 'life', 'play', 'part', 'Kubrick', 'hit', 'grand', 'slam', 'TV', 'version', 'irrelevant', 'casual', 'fans', 'However', 'am', 'not', 'mere', 'casual', 'fan', 'knew', 'would', 'have', 'view', 'TV', 'version', 'Overall', 'came', 'away', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'buying', 'would', 'do', 'again', 'simply', 'not', 'something', 'will', 'cherish', 'years', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'way', 'do', 'just', 'winter', 'Kubrick', 'yearly', 'ritual', 'Stephen', 'Weber', 'did', 'very', 'admirable', 'job', 'considering', 'challenge', 'was', 'presented', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'face', 'impossible', 'avoid', 'comparing', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'when', 'do', 'Weber', 'up', 'very', 'short', 'already', 'typecast', 'mind', 'goofy', 'younger', 'brother', 'Wings', 'direction', 'was', 'simply', 'not', 'same', 'artistic', 'level', 'Kubrick', 'found', 'kid', 'VERY', 'annoying', 'as', 'well', 'alone', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'final', 'nail', 'coffin', 'one', 'None', 'other', 'characters', 'were', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'either', 'think', 'very', 'very', 'talented', 'person/team', 'could', 'produce', 'movie', 'book', 'closely', 'much', 'more', 'disturbing', 'one', 'result', 'here', 'simply', 'mark', 'moving', 'hedge', 'animals', 'were', 'absurd', 'had', 'only', 'appeared', 'move', 'when', 'character', 'looked', 'away', 'maybe', 'actually', 'show', 'happening', 'Again', 'curse', 'CGI', 'tempting', 'movie', 'makers', 'show', 'things', 'are', 'better', 'implied.I', 'give', 'bonus', 'points', 'filming', 'actual', 'Stanley', 'Hotel', 'inspired', 'King', 'write', 'Shining', 'Very', 'cool', 'see', 'again', 'find', 'Kubrick', 'Overlook', 'Hotel', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'comparing', 'musical', 'scores', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'Kubrick', 'version', 'can', 'feel', 'chills', 'Jack', 'Torrence', 'car', 'way', 'gigantic', 'mountains', 'accompanied', 'utterly', 'creepy', 'music', 'welcome', 'companion', 'are', 'equivalent', 'chills', 'entire', 'TV', 'movie', 'TV', 'movie', 'not', 'accomplish', 'sense', 'desolation', '.madness', '.Cabin', 'Fever', 'are', 'really', 'most', 'fascinating', 'elements', 'final', 'slap', 'face', 'TV', 'version', 'mercilessly', 'sappy', 'ending', 'unravels', 'tension', 'final', 'hours', 'very', 'weak', 'fashion.I', ""'ll"", 'put', 'way', 'Kubrick', 'movie', 'had', 'never', 'existed', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'little', 'discussion', 'popular', 'culture', 'point', 'book', 'TV', 'movie']",Stephen King's The Shining

724786,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,B000077VRT,David Girod,"[18, 21]","I'm a big fan of the TV mini-series work done by Mick Garris and Stephen King. ""The Stand"", ""It"", ""Tommyknockers"", ""The Langoliers"", ""Salems Lot"", ""Storm of the Century"", ""Rose Red"" etc. (I know Garris wasn't involved with all of them, but he's helmed the best of the lot so far and is synonymous with the King Mini-series niche)I was looking forward to ""The Shining"" when it was first broadcast, and recently re-watched the DVD presentation.The Good: Steven Weber and Rebecca De Mornay do a really good job as Jack and Wendy Torrance. Weber specifically handles the job of playing an alcoholic struggling to remain sober very well. Melvin Van Peebles is also fantastic as Dick Holleran who first recognizes Danny's ability to shine. Outside of the acting, the setting is top notch, and creates a great sense of isolation. I love the way the ""Overlook Hotel"" becomes a formidable and frightening place as the movie plays out, and the soundtrack by Nicholas Pike is top notch, at times echoing ""The Amityville Horror"" and ""The Haunting"" scores.The Bad: The special effects are fairly weak, while the ""lady in the bathtub"" looks pretty chilling, all suspension of disbelief is lost when the topiary begins moving onscreen. The initial topiary attack on Jack is done with sound and quick cuts to the various hedged wildlife, and is very effective. This is soon replaced with lousy CGI effects of the woodland critters moving through the snow, and it just looks awful. Courtland Mead as Danny Torrance is a tough call. It's such a HUGE and integral part of the story you need a really strong actor to carry the role, and Mead just isn't up to it. His lisping, baby-talk voice gets grating very quickly.I thought this was a decent film, nowhere near the adaptations of ""It"" or ""The Stand"" though. And it's tough, because inevitably comparisons will be drawn to Kubrick's ""The Shining"". Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Jack Torrance in that film has become a horror icon. And while Weber is good, you can't help but draw comparisons to Nicholson's character. Still, if you are a fan of King's novel, and enjoy the various mini-series that have come out over the past few decades based on his work, you will probably like this version of ""The Shining"".",2,It's Tough to Forget a Horror Icon,1222128000,"09 23, 2008",2008,2243,"[""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'TV', 'mini-series', 'work', 'done', 'Mick', 'Garris', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Stand', 'Tommyknockers', 'Langoliers', 'Lot', 'Storm', 'Century', 'Rose', 'Red', 'etc', 'know', 'Garris', 'was', ""n't"", 'involved', 'helmed', 'best', 'lot', 'so', 'far', 'synonymous', 'King', 'Mini-series', 'niche', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'Shining', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'broadcast', 'recently', 're-watched', 'DVD', 'presentation.The', 'Good', 'Steven', 'Weber', 'Rebecca', 'De', 'Mornay', 'do', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'Jack', 'Wendy', 'Torrance', 'Weber', 'specifically', 'job', 'playing', 'alcoholic', 'struggling', 'remain', 'sober', 'very', 'well', 'Melvin', 'Van', 'Peebles', 'also', 'fantastic', 'Dick', 'Holleran', 'who', 'first', 'Danny', 'ability', 'shine', 'acting', 'setting', 'top', 'notch', 'great', 'sense', 'isolation', 'love', 'way', 'Overlook', 'Hotel', 'formidable', 'frightening', 'place', 'movie', 'out', 'soundtrack', 'Nicholas', 'Pike', 'top', 'notch', 'times', 'echoing', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'Haunting', 'scores.The', 'Bad', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'fairly', 'weak', 'lady', 'bathtub', 'pretty', 'chilling', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'lost', 'when', 'topiary', 'begins', 'moving', 'onscreen', 'initial', 'topiary', 'attack', 'Jack', 'done', 'sound', 'quick', 'cuts', 'various', 'hedged', 'wildlife', 'very', 'effective', 'soon', 'replaced', 'lousy', 'CGI', 'effects', 'woodland', 'critters', 'moving', 'snow', 'just', 'awful', 'Courtland', 'Mead', 'Danny', 'Torrance', 'tough', 'call', 'such', 'HUGE', 'integral', 'part', 'story', 'need', 'really', 'strong', 'actor', 'carry', 'role', 'Mead', 'just', ""n't"", 'up', 'lisping', 'baby-talk', 'voice', 'grating', 'very', 'quickly.I', 'thought', 'was', 'decent', 'film', 'nowhere', 'adaptations', 'Stand', 'tough', 'inevitably', 'comparisons', 'will', 'be', 'drawn', 'Kubrick', 'Shining', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'portrayal', 'Jack', 'Torrance', 'film', 'become', 'horror', 'icon', 'Weber', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'draw', 'comparisons', 'Nicholson', 'character', 'Still', 'are', 'fan', 'King', 'novel', 'enjoy', 'various', 'mini-series', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'past', 'few', 'decades', 'based', 'work', 'will', 'probably', 'version', 'Shining']",Stephen King's The Shining
724787,A39L5T2ZQZ52FN,B000077VRT,David Michael Cohen,"[20, 25]","If I am ever elected to congress I shall make it a capital offense for Stephen King to have anything to do with bringing one of his stories to video.  If anyone objects I shall cite Maximum Overdrive, Sleepwalkers and The Shining mini-series.  Although ostensibly an attempt to recreate the novel, SKTS ignores some vital aspects of the book for the sake of Hollywood appeal.The series begins with Jack talking with acting has-been Elliot Gould, doing what amounts to an extended commercial for AA.  Now the Jack of the book was too stubborn to seek help, he tried to quit drinking on his own, a major factor in his breakdown.  But AA is politically correct, and in Hollywood PC is, ya know, good.Soon we meet Jack's wife, Wendy.  Now the Wendy of the book was a plain Jane with self-esteem issues.  She stayed with Jack, even when she feared him, because she was afraid of being alone.  In SKTS, however, Wendy is a beautiful, strong woman who can take care of herself.  Why would such a woman stay with a man like Jack?  Who knows, but strong, beautiful women are politically correct, and Hollywood says if its PC it's, ya' know, good.Soon we meet Danny, and Tony.  The kid who plays Danny doesn't just need acting lessons, but speech lessons.  His garbled lines are barely intelligeble.  As for Tony, he hovers over Danny giving lofty advice and directions like some kind of guardian angel.  In the book and the Kubrik film, Tony was an unseen presence, as fit his role.  Why was he made so ridiculously blatant in SKTS?  Because in 1997 angels were a fad, and as Hollywood knows, fads are, ya' know, good.Some reviewers have lauded how SKTS crammed in every little bit of miutia from the book.  Yes this was done, from the important details (Jack's special relationship with Danny) to the extraneous (the hornet's nest) and the silly (the killer bushes).  But, so what?  The foundation of the movie was ruined, making everything that happened afterwards irrelavent!  The bottom line is SKTS is not a true work of King, it is a work of Hollywood, and as far as horror movies go, Hollywood is, ya' know, bad.",2,"King goes Hollywood, The Shining goes fizzle",1059091200,"07 25, 2003",2003,2110,"['am', 'ever', 'elected', 'congress', 'shall', 'make', 'capital', 'offense', 'Stephen', 'King', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'bringing', 'one', 'stories', 'video', 'anyone', 'shall', 'cite', 'Maximum', 'Overdrive', 'Sleepwalkers', 'Shining', 'mini-series', 'ostensibly', 'attempt', 'recreate', 'novel', 'SKTS', 'vital', 'aspects', 'book', 'sake', 'Hollywood', 'appeal.The', 'series', 'Jack', 'talking', 'acting', 'has-been', 'Elliot', 'Gould', 'doing', 'what', 'amounts', 'extended', 'commercial', 'AA', 'Now', 'Jack', 'book', 'was', 'too', 'stubborn', 'seek', 'help', 'tried', 'quit', 'drinking', 'own', 'major', 'factor', 'breakdown', 'AA', 'politically', 'correct', 'Hollywood', 'PC', 'ya', 'know', 'good.Soon', 'meet', 'Jack', 'wife', 'Wendy', 'Now', 'Wendy', 'book', 'was', 'plain', 'Jane', 'self-esteem', 'issues', 'stayed', 'Jack', 'even', 'when', 'feared', 'was', 'afraid', 'being', 'alone', 'SKTS', 'however', 'Wendy', 'beautiful', 'strong', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'take', 'care', 'herself', 'Why', 'would', 'such', 'woman', 'stay', 'man', 'Jack', 'Who', 'strong', 'beautiful', 'women', 'are', 'politically', 'correct', 'Hollywood', 'PC', 'know', 'good.Soon', 'meet', 'Danny', 'Tony', 'kid', 'who', 'Danny', ""n't"", 'just', 'need', 'acting', 'lessons', 'speech', 'lessons', 'garbled', 'lines', 'are', 'barely', 'intelligeble', 'Tony', 'Danny', 'giving', 'lofty', 'advice', 'directions', 'kind', 'guardian', 'angel', 'book', 'Kubrik', 'film', 'Tony', 'was', 'unseen', 'presence', 'fit', 'role', 'Why', 'was', 'made', 'so', 'ridiculously', 'blatant', 'SKTS', '1997', 'angels', 'were', 'fad', 'Hollywood', 'knows', 'fads', 'are', 'know', 'good.Some', 'reviewers', 'have', 'lauded', 'how', 'SKTS', 'crammed', 'little', 'bit', 'miutia', 'book', 'Yes', 'was', 'done', 'important', 'details', 'Jack', 'special', 'relationship', 'Danny', 'extraneous', 'hornet', 'nest', 'silly', 'killer', 'bushes', 'what', 'foundation', 'movie', 'was', 'ruined', 'making', 'everything', 'happened', 'afterwards', 'irrelavent', 'bottom', 'line', 'SKTS', 'not', 'true', 'work', 'King', 'work', 'Hollywood', 'as', 'far', 'horror', 'movies', 'go', 'Hollywood', 'know', 'bad']",Stephen King's The Shining
724788,AVZUVRF7MFS24,B000077VRT,David S. Jenkins,"[5, 11]","I bought this DVD out of sheer boredom and found it absolutely riveting, truly one of the best small screen films I've ever seen, genuinely frightening at a number of points, and a much more interesting story that the 1980 film. The Kubrick &quot;original&quot; was fine, great fun, and Jack Nicholson is, well, Jack Nicholson! But side by side this 1997 edition is superior in almost every way. First, Jack's performance was over the top and Shelly Duvall was horribly miscast, a cartoon character. Secondly, while Kubrick's cinematographic sense was as always exquisite and haunting, his storytelling abilities were often suspect. King's version of his own story draws you much, MUCH deeper into the tale. You quickly find yourself a silent guest in the hotel....Weber's performance is perhaps less wildly entertaining but more effective in its subtle shift into madness. All the support cast are excellent, but the shining star (sorry) is Rebecca DeMornay, who plays a strong, intelligent, forceful woman who you really pull for when the going gets tough. A great, multi-layered performance - a sensual, bright woman who loves her husband but regrets the absence of passion in their relationship, a wife who struggles to maintain a positive attitude as she faces the dispair of a disfunctional mate and a bleak low rent future, and a mother who adores her child but is in awe and fear of his powers.... all played by a strikingly beautiful actress who is moving into more mature roles with grace and style.Production values are just as high as in the Kubrick version. The look of the film is rich and textured, you can feel how empty this hotel is, you can hear floorboards creaking under your feet. Even the 11 deleted scenes are excellent.Buy this DVD, turn out the lights on a rainy night, curl up with someone you love, take the phone off the hook and gently allow yourself to get creeped out.

But while a few scenes are well done, for the most part, this overly long adaption never achieves the ""madness"" of Kubrick's film.Worst of all, the hotel never even seems to be snowed in or istolated! It's MUCH smaller than Kubricks' Overlook, so you never get to nervously wonder what ""else"" is going on in the hotel. And all of the ""set-ups"" go nowhere.For example (SPOILER), the ""lawn animals"" come alive and threaten Danny at the end of disc 2--well, when you start disc 3 wondering how he will escape...the animals simply return to their ""non-alive"" state. And while the scene with the woman in the bathtub is very well shot...it too, goes nowhere. There is the idea that a real woman is living away in the hotel--a scary thought--but it's dropped and Wendy agrees that maybe Danny smeared lipstick on himself and choked himself.While Kubrick's film also starts slowly, there is a sense of dread. The TV version starts slowly...but it's slow for 90 minutes! It's simply too long with flashbacks that are not needed (Jack hurting the school boy, etc.) and when things start happening (achieved best in the 2nd disk) you realize that there is STILL 90 mins left.And that's where this version totally falls apart. Jack has 90 mins to kill his wife and son. But. He. Can't. Quite. Do. It.I mean, half a dozen times he has his wife cornered, the mallet is raised...and he doesn't do it.

Poor Stanley went for shocks as opposed to that whole road of characterization.Is this version THE ""Shining"" to see? No. See them both. Kubrick's most memorable moments aren't found in the book or this version (although, I do prefer Stephen Weber's line in place of Jack's ""Here's Johnny""). No elevator blood, no twins (even though they were in the book; Grady is childless here), no ""All work and no play"".What's present with the miniseries is the story. Suffice to say, Jack Torrance was not a weird little guy to begin with. He did not just have a mental breakdown, as Kubrick tried to hint. There's a lot of build up and foreshadowing (the wasp nest, for instance) that was lost in the film version. Jack is a tragic character, a pawn in a battle of supernatural forces. The infamous axe has been dropped in place of its rightful predecessor, the roque (Denver croquet here) mallet. And even with four hours to ""fill"", some bits and pieces were lost.Jack Nicholson versus Stephen Weber: no contest, right? Wrong. Weber gives ol' Wolf-Grin a run for his money, but what brings Jack back to the top is that when Torrance does lose it, Nicholson is more convincing. The Dick Halloran here is great, but Scatman Crothers seemed more like Dick to me. The rest of the ""new"" cast is an improvement. Rebecca De Morney is a perfect Wendy, far better from Shelly Duvall's homely, helpless portrayal. The new Danny has a lisp, but it's better than hearing him croak around with his finger saying ""redrum"".I again prefer this version for its ending. The Kubrick version is soulless and mundane.

Basically it was nothing like the novel. However, when I heard of a miniseries coming to TV of The Shining my hopes were risen. When I finally saw the miniseries I came away absolutely loving it. My only problem with it was that Delbert Grady in the miniseries version was a caretaker with no family like he was in the book. Like I said though that was my only problem with the newer version. With the exception of that everything else in the miniseries was almost exactly like the book (unlike Kubrick's butchery).Weber was just phenomenal as Jack. Weber's performance of the madness and insanity Jack eventually succumbs to being more and more gradual was how Nicholson should have played Torrence in Kubrick's version. Not played it the way he did with Torrence seeming a little crazy in personality even from the beginning (of course than again this film was made right at the end of the 70's decade where all kinds of drugs were used and Kubrick used various neon lights towards the end of his 2001: A Space Odyssey movie). In addition to Weber's gradual insane performance, the way he touched upon his love for Danny and ultimately not willing to ever hurt Danny again (like he did when he broke Danny's arm) was just very moving and touching. That human aspect of the original movie was lost where Nicholson didn't even care that his Jack Torrance was trying to kill his son, Danny.Demornay was so much better than DuVall. Demornay is such a talented actress. The fact that she was able to pull off a perfect balance of vulnerability as well as determination and courage for the life of her son just makes her an even better actress in my eyes. DuVall's Wendy on the other hand just made you want to reach in and strangle her for constantly being so weak and wimpy.Melvin VanPeebles and Courtland Mead who play Dick Halloran and Danny Torrance added some nice touch up's to two of the three characters (three including/counting Jack) who possess the ""shining"" as Dick calls it. Mick Garris (who also directed King's miniseries of The Stand) nicely balances the human/character aspects of this more truer miniseries with the hotel as a character itself too/as well.If you wish to see a truly good adapatation of a Stephen King novel (not to discredit Carrie, Shawshank and Greenmile cause those were just as good) than bypass Kubrick's Shining and just rent this miniseries version directed by Mick Garris and that had King's completel input in it.",5,"""The Shining"": A Shining Brillance for King",1110758400,"03 14, 2005",2005,2577,"['am', 'HUGE', 'Stephen', 'King', 'fan', 'so', 'when', 'saw', '1980', 'version', 'directed', 'Kubrick', 'Nicholson', 'absolutely', 'hated', 'Basically', 'was', 'nothing', 'novel', 'However', 'when', 'heard', 'miniseries', 'coming', 'TV', 'Shining', 'hopes', 'were', 'risen', 'When', 'finally', 'saw', 'miniseries', 'came', 'away', 'absolutely', 'loving', 'My', 'only', 'problem', 'was', 'Delbert', 'Grady', 'miniseries', 'version', 'was', 'caretaker', 'family', 'was', 'book', 'said', 'was', 'only', 'problem', 'newer', 'version', 'exception', 'everything', 'else', 'miniseries', 'was', 'almost', 'exactly', 'book', 'Kubrick', 'butchery', '.Weber', 'was', 'just', 'phenomenal', 'Jack', 'Weber', 'performance', 'madness', 'insanity', 'Jack', 'eventually', 'being', 'more', 'more', 'gradual', 'was', 'how', 'Nicholson', 'should', 'have', 'played', 'Torrence', 'Kubrick', 'version', 'Not', 'played', 'way', 'did', 'Torrence', 'seeming', 'little', 'crazy', 'personality', 'even', 'beginning', 'course', 'again', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'right', 'end', '70', 'decade', 'where', 'kinds', 'drugs', 'were', 'used', 'Kubrick', 'used', 'various', 'neon', 'lights', 'end', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'movie', 'addition', 'Weber', 'gradual', 'insane', 'performance', 'way', 'touched', 'love', 'Danny', 'ultimately', 'not', 'willing', 'ever', 'hurt', 'Danny', 'again', 'did', 'when', 'broke', 'Danny', 'arm', 'was', 'just', 'very', 'moving', 'touching', 'human', 'aspect', 'original', 'movie', 'was', 'lost', 'where', 'Nicholson', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'care', 'Jack', 'Torrance', 'was', 'trying', 'kill', 'son', 'Danny.Demornay', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'DuVall', 'Demornay', 'such', 'talented', 'actress', 'fact', 'was', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'perfect', 'balance', 'vulnerability', 'as', 'well', 'determination', 'courage', 'life', 'son', 'just', 'even', 'better', 'actress', 'eyes', 'DuVall', 'Wendy', 'other', 'hand', 'just', 'made', 'want', 'reach', 'strangle', 'constantly', 'being', 'so', 'weak', 'wimpy.Melvin', 'VanPeebles', 'Courtland', 'Mead', 'who', 'play', 'Dick', 'Halloran', 'Danny', 'Torrance', 'added', 'nice', 'touch', 'up', 'two', 'three', 'characters', 'three', 'including/counting', 'Jack', 'who', 'possess', 'shining', 'Dick', 'Mick', 'Garris', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'King', 'miniseries', 'Stand', 'nicely', 'human/character', 'aspects', 'more', 'truer', 'miniseries', 'hotel', 'character', 'too/as', 'well.If', 'wish', 'see', 'truly', 'good', 'adapatation', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novel', 'not', 'discredit', 'Carrie', 'Shawshank', 'Greenmile', 'cause', 'were', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'bypass', 'Kubrick', 'Shining', 'just', 'rent', 'miniseries', 'version', 'directed', 'Mick', 'Garris', 'had', 'King', 'completel', 'input']",Stephen King's The Shining

724802,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B000077VRT,Erik North,"[14, 18]","Ever since 1980, when Stanley Kubrick's epic film version of his novel came out, Stephen King has gone out of his way to slam the late director for having taken so many liberties with ""The Shining.""  So in 1997, to make sure it was ""done right"", King adapted the novel as a three-part ABC-TV miniseries and put director Mick Garris in the driver's seat, as well putting Steven Weber and Rebecca DeMornay in the roles played by Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall in Kubrick's version.The end result, unfortunately, aside from showing why Kubrick's film remains so memorable, shows how insufficient a writer King is when he is not writing novels but writing for television or directly for the cinema.  What works in print will not necessarily translate to either the small or big screen, and that is a truth that King, as good a writer as he is (and he is one of my favorites), has never come to grips with.The whole story is still the same, with the Overlook Hotel and its penchant for violence and murder, and young Danny Torrance and his alter-ego Tony, and, of course, his ""shining.""  The moving topiary animals of the novel, which Kubrick could not replicate because of special effects limitations, are in this version.  But there are also elements, such as the subplot involving Weber and Alcoholics Anonymous, and the trick ending, of the Overlook being ""rebuilt"" after it is consumed in a firestorm by its own aging boiler, that struck me as being peculiar at best and terrible at worst; it's almost as if King, seemingly so obsessed with ""getting back"" at Kubrick, had gone out of his way to trash his own novel.  It just didn't make any sense.  Nor did Garris' often slipshod direction of the proceedings, as the story never reached the chilling and disturbing heights of the 1980 film.  Weber does a good turn as Jack Torrance, given that he is forever in the shadow of Nicholson; and DeMornay is sufficient as Wendy, though there's no trace of the psychological hysteria of Duvall's performance in the Kubrick film.  But the actors who played, respectively, Lloyd the Bartender and the murderous caretaker Delbert Grady here categorically COULD NOT hold a candle to either Phillip Stone or Joe Turkel in Kubrick's opus.  Nor could Courtland Mead in the Danny Torrance role done by Danny Lloyd; here, he is just simply obnoxious.Kubrick's film may have taken great liberties with its source material, but the end result was a film whose unsettling images have remained in the public's cinematic mindscape for the last quarter century.

724803,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B000077VRT,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[2, 3]","Stephen King drew heavily from Shirley Jackson's THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE for his 1977 novel THE SHINING; even so, the result was uniquely his own, and it remains one of his best works.  It was first filmed in 1980 by director Stanley Kubrick and starring Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall; although it was and is popular, it is not noticeably like King's novel in either detail or tone, and King himself is on record as greatly disliking it.  In 1997 King had the opportunity correct the situation: directed by Mick Garris; starring Steven Webber, Rebecca De Mornay, and Courtland Mead; and with a script by King himself, THE SHINING became a mini-series that is much more faithful to King's original vision than Kubrick ever was.The story is very famous.  Jack Torrance (Steven Webber) is a recovering alcoholic whose drinking always seemed to bring out an underlying abusive nature.  With the help of wife Winifred (Rebecca de Mornay), he has kicked the habit and become a good father to his son Danny (Courtland Mead.)  But his reputation for the bottle has left him without job prospects, and the only thing that comes his way is an offer to act as caretaker of a famous hotel, The Overlook, which closes during the winter due to heavy snows that make the roads impassible.  It seems like a good opportunity for Jack to write and the family to grow closer.  Unfortunately, The Overlook is a hotel possessed by ghosts--and perhaps something more--and the little boy Danny has a telepathic gift, ""the shining.""  And the hotel wants him.The hotel sets out to get at Danny through Jack's weaknesses, invading his mind, offering him intoxicating beverages, and pushing him to render his wife helpless (and if possible dead) and further pushing him to kill Danny, that his spirit might be consumed by the hotel.  But Danny senses the danger long before they arrive at the hotel, and over time Winnie comes to see it herself.  Jack, however, is blind to the hotel's evil, and he soon becomes a part of its horror show.  But Danny's gift and his father's love ultimately prove as dangerous to the hotel as they are desirable to it.A good many people have damned this version of THE SHINING with faint praise, saying it is overlong, too literal, too talky, too melodramatic, too this and too that.  I would agree that the first third of this mini-series feels slightly slow and that some of the ""ghost effects"" are a bit much--we're treated to a few too many lamps that light themselves, jukeboxes that play themselves, swings that swing themselves and such.  But on the whole, I think it captures the covert ugliness and insanity of King's novel much better than the Kubrick film ever did.  If you're a die hard fan of Nicholson or Kubrick, you probably won't agree, but if you want to see King's novel faithfully translated to the screen, this is it.  The picture is good, the sound is good, and all three parts come with memorable audio commentary from King, actor Steven Webber, director Mick Garris, and others.

I had seen the Kubrick version long before I read the book, and always thought of it as a masterpiece. Although entirely altered from the book, Kubrick's version still stands as my all-time favorite horror film.Apparently, Stephen King held a 17-year long grudge against the 1980 version because it was so much different than his book. So finally, he decided to do a faithful adaption of his book...this being the result. It was created as a miniseries for ABC, so most of the bad language and sex from the book was cut out, however, I was surprised at how much violence they allowed (especially considering that ABC is owned by Diney.) Overall, I was pleased by this 4 1/2 hour adaption of the book...the following are a list of things I liked and didn't like about the film:PROS:Very faithful adaptation of the bookSteven Weber did a great jobThe hedge animals were included in the filmGives much more background on the Overlook and the dead things that lurk insideGives more background on the Torrance familyIt is very nicely updatedJack's desent into insanity was much more gradualCONS:I felt that King was trying too hard to avoid connections to the Kubrick versionAt times, the film felt too glossyThe man in the dog costume wasn't as odd and gruesome as he was in the bookDoesn't maintain the dreadful atmosphere of the Kubrick versionThe hotel was better in the Kubrick versionThe scene in which the clock begins to squirt bloody tissue and brains all over the glass was left out...which was very symbolic to meAt times, I found Courtland Mead's upper lip to be somewhat distractingThe special effetcs were over-used just a bitThe obvious ""commercial breaks"" became annoyingIf someone asked me which version they should see, I would have to reccomend the Kubrick version because I believe that it is truly frightening (and a lot shorter running time to handle.)

Based on these inaccurate comments one can only come to the conclusion that these reviewers have never read fully the King novel or, if they have read it, retained nothing from it. The mini-series version of 'The Shining' is NOT true to the novel; and what is most surprising and appalling about this is that King himself wrote the screenplay for the mini-series, and brought this mini-series to the small screen for reasons of bringing justice to his story after the Kubrick version deviated from it.Although the motivation of the characters and a skeletal representation of the story remain faithful to the book, 'The Shining' mini-series is full of plot changes and inconsistencies, as well as dialogue changes and even a few character changes -- none of which have/had anything to do with entertainment/artistic quality or the limiting factors of a made-for-TV horror movie. (I could make a very long list of all the things that deviate from the book, and none of them were necessary nor gave any more meaning to the story.) And -- with the exception of Rebecca De Mornay -- the casting and, hence, character credibility in this episodic version is outrageously bad. And as far as the direction of this travesty, either this director is a visionless hack or he is too easily wooed, manipulated and influenced by King's own direction and screenplay.King's novel 'The Shining' is arguably one of, if not THE, most scariest books ever written. I've read it many times and it (just  like the Kubrick film) still scares the hell out of me and creeps me out every time I read it. This mini-series is about as scary as an episode of Goosebumps. It's a corny Saturday morning TV melodrama that DICTATES to the audience that it is scary and dramatic, using all the same hackneyed, trite horror movie sound effects, music, and gimmicks that have been used for far too long.Because the best scare and the best horror is the kind that is brought out in the mind and imagination of the reader, King's literature works best as literature and not as a film adaption of literature. But regardless, despite the highly necessary deviations the Kubrick version makes, the Kubrick film captures the real feeling and the real horror of King's book, as well as achieves it in far less time. Despite the amount of time the mini-series is bestowed, it fails in every way to achieve what it sets out to accomplish.",1,A Betrayal Of His Own Literature,1134950400,"12 19, 2005",2005,2567,"['When', 'read', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'King', 'TV', 'mini-series', 'Shining', 'keep', 'seeing', 'comments', 'book', ""'Closer"", 'book', 'Kubrick', 'version', 'Based', 'inaccurate', 'comments', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'come', 'conclusion', 'reviewers', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'fully', 'King', 'novel', 'have', 'read', 'retained', 'nothing', 'mini-series', 'version', ""'The"", 'Shining', 'NOT', 'true', 'novel', 'what', 'most', 'surprising', 'appalling', 'King', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'mini-series', 'brought', 'mini-series', 'small', 'screen', 'reasons', 'bringing', 'justice', 'story', 'Kubrick', 'version', 'deviated', 'motivation', 'characters', 'skeletal', 'representation', 'story', 'remain', 'faithful', 'book', 'Shining', 'mini-series', 'full', 'plot', 'changes', 'inconsistencies', 'as', 'well', 'dialogue', 'changes', 'even', 'few', 'character', 'changes', 'none', 'have/had', 'anything', 'do', 'entertainment/artistic', 'quality', 'limiting', 'factors', 'made-for-TV', 'horror', 'movie', 'could', 'make', 'very', 'long', 'list', 'things', 'deviate', 'book', 'none', 'were', 'necessary', 'gave', 'more', 'meaning', 'story', 'exception', 'Rebecca', 'De', 'Mornay', 'casting', 'hence', 'character', 'credibility', 'episodic', 'version', 'outrageously', 'bad', 'as', 'far', 'direction', 'travesty', 'director', 'visionless', 'hack', 'too', 'easily', 'wooed', 'manipulated', 'influenced', 'King', 'own', 'direction', 'screenplay.King', 'novel', ""'The"", 'Shining', 'arguably', 'one', 'not', 'THE', 'most', 'scariest', 'books', 'ever', 'written', ""'ve"", 'read', 'many', 'times', 'just', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'still', 'hell', 'creeps', 'time', 'read', 'mini-series', 'as', 'scary', 'episode', 'Goosebumps', 'corny', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'TV', 'melodrama', 'audience', 'scary', 'dramatic', 'using', 'same', 'hackneyed', 'trite', 'horror', 'movie', 'sound', 'effects', 'music', 'gimmicks', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'far', 'too', 'best', 'scare', 'best', 'horror', 'kind', 'brought', 'out', 'mind', 'imagination', 'reader', 'King', 'literature', 'best', 'literature', 'not', 'film', 'adaption', 'literature', 'regardless', 'highly', 'necessary', 'deviations', 'Kubrick', 'version', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'real', 'feeling', 'real', 'horror', 'King', 'book', 'as', 'well', 'achieves', 'far', 'less', 'time', 'amount', 'time', 'mini-series', 'bestowed', 'way', 'achieve', 'what', 'out', 'accomplish']",Stephen King's The Shining

724812,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B000077VRT,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 7]","Stephen King never liked Kubrick's adaptation of his eponymous novel. Granted. Then he finally did it himself in the form of a mini series for TV. He had two things to carefully avoid: direct similarities to the film and direct betrayal of his own book since he criticized Kubrick's film as not being faithful to the book. As for the first objective, he tries hard and succeeds on a few elements. Success with the animals carved from bushes in the garden. Success with the hotel that is not the one used by Kubrick, hence smaller and less spectacular.But then the differentiation he is trying hard to introduce makes him change some elements that are directly from the book, hence he drops elements I personally consider essential in the book. The use of the radio: we directly jump to destroying it in a fit of furor. The sabotaging of the snow mobile is reduced to some kind of secondary element. He is not shown has becoming both haunted by the past of the hotel and impotent in his own intellectual work: he drops his playwright's project and delves into discovering the past thanks to old newspapers he finds in the cellar, research and reconstruction, that is intellectual potency.The child does not connect with the killed twins and the man does not connect with the female victim. His going back to the past is reduced to some short sequences and only to two men, altogether. Why has this haunting been reduced? But the famous axe is gotten rid of in favor of a giant crocket hammer that reveals itself particularly sturdy when used as a killing weapon. But the worst is still to come. The end of the hotel is due to the explosion of the boiler. The hotel is not destroyed in the book and Torrance freezes to death in the labyrinth. This explosion is directly caused by Torrance himself in some kind of scuffle with the two ghosts from the past. Torrance hence remains sane at the end and kills himself, the culprit of all this tale, destroys the monstrous hotel, and even worse, a sequence is added ten years later when the boy graduates with honors mind you from his high school in the presence of the black cook who survived what should have been his death and the mother, and, betrayal of betrayals, the ghost of the father expressing his love to the son who receives it with gratitude.This adaptation by Stephen King himself shows an evolution of the author both because of age probably, answering thus to the criticism that he is too cruel with his characters, and to the medium he is using here, television that requires some kind of curbing because of the wide audience it has. But the series, though the rhythm is slower than the film's and that is good, appears to be a pale version of the book and we do not capture the cold of the winter, the isolation of the place and the horror of the derangement of Torrance and also of his wife and his son.We miss particularly the mechanism that brings total annihilation to anyone and anything that stands in the way of the planned vengeance of the past onto the present. There is only one answer to that situation SOS and escape if you can. That's the book. The series does not create that atmosphere and that urgency, not to speak of that fate, connected in the book to some kind of lore about Indians.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,Stephen King betrays his own novel,1225584000,"11 2, 2008",2008,3285,"['Stephen', 'King', 'never', 'liked', 'Kubrick', 'adaptation', 'eponymous', 'novel', 'Granted', 'Then', 'finally', 'did', 'form', 'mini', 'series', 'TV', 'had', 'two', 'things', 'carefully', 'avoid', 'direct', 'similarities', 'film', 'direct', 'betrayal', 'own', 'book', 'criticized', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'not', 'being', 'faithful', 'book', 'first', 'objective', 'hard', 'few', 'elements', 'Success', 'animals', 'carved', 'bushes', 'garden', 'Success', 'hotel', 'not', 'one', 'used', 'Kubrick', 'hence', 'smaller', 'less', 'spectacular.But', 'then', 'differentiation', 'trying', 'hard', 'introduce', 'change', 'elements', 'are', 'directly', 'book', 'hence', 'elements', 'personally', 'consider', 'essential', 'book', 'use', 'radio', 'directly', 'jump', 'destroying', 'fit', 'furor', 'sabotaging', 'snow', 'mobile', 'reduced', 'kind', 'secondary', 'element', 'not', 'shown', 'becoming', 'haunted', 'past', 'hotel', 'impotent', 'own', 'intellectual', 'work', 'playwright', 'project', 'discovering', 'past', 'thanks', 'old', 'newspapers', 'cellar', 'research', 'reconstruction', 'intellectual', 'potency.The', 'child', 'not', 'connect', 'killed', 'twins', 'man', 'not', 'connect', 'female', 'victim', 'going', 'back', 'past', 'reduced', 'short', 'sequences', 'only', 'two', 'men', 'altogether', 'Why', 'haunting', 'been', 'reduced', 'famous', 'axe', 'gotten', 'rid', 'favor', 'giant', 'crocket', 'hammer', 'particularly', 'sturdy', 'when', 'used', 'killing', 'weapon', 'worst', 'still', 'come', 'end', 'hotel', 'due', 'explosion', 'boiler', 'hotel', 'not', 'destroyed', 'book', 'Torrance', 'death', 'labyrinth', 'explosion', 'directly', 'caused', 'Torrance', 'kind', 'scuffle', 'two', 'ghosts', 'past', 'Torrance', 'hence', 'sane', 'end', 'kills', 'culprit', 'tale', 'monstrous', 'hotel', 'even', 'worse', 'sequence', 'added', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'boy', 'honors', 'mind', 'high', 'school', 'presence', 'black', 'cook', 'who', 'survived', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'death', 'mother', 'betrayal', 'betrayals', 'ghost', 'father', 'expressing', 'love', 'son', 'who', 'gratitude.This', 'adaptation', 'Stephen', 'King', 'evolution', 'author', 'age', 'probably', 'answering', 'thus', 'criticism', 'too', 'cruel', 'characters', 'medium', 'using', 'here', 'television', 'kind', 'curbing', 'wide', 'audience', 'series', 'rhythm', 'slower', 'film', 'good', 'be', 'pale', 'version', 'book', 'do', 'not', 'capture', 'cold', 'winter', 'isolation', 'place', 'horror', 'derangement', 'Torrance', 'also', 'wife', 'son.We', 'miss', 'particularly', 'mechanism', 'total', 'annihilation', 'anyone', 'anything', 'way', 'planned', 'vengeance', 'past', 'present', 'only', 'one', 'answer', 'situation', 'SOS', 'escape', 'can', 'book', 'series', 'not', 'create', 'atmosphere', 'urgency', 'not', 'speak', 'fate', 'connected', 'book', 'kind', 'lore', 'Indians.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",Stephen King's The Shining

724817,A2R8F23VCZHB7M,B000077VRT,Jeremy Bailey,"[14, 30]","What can I say about this film that is good? The acting is very shallow. The movie was cheesy and very very very long.What interest me about Stanley Kubricks version was how real and to-the-point it was. This Jack reminds me of a couple people I had known, to have this spooky side to them. The wife is also someone I can relate with, knowing one wife who was married to a drunk. So to me, the acting in the original was quite real, which also added to its terror.The new one apparently didn't do the research.There are more flashbacks than I could care for in this movie. Hardly anything is left to the imagination, which is powerful; it makes books exciting.We don't need flashbacks about his drinking problems, we don't need flashbacks of him hurting Danny's arm. Saying it is enough. And what is with this physic Danny anyways?I couldn't believe it. The mother is going off, asking him these physic questions. In the original, he was a shiner, and was basically just between him and Tony, couple times with the cook.This version has too many of those in-your-face scenes. People leave, and something moves. The original was done better, it was left more to the imagination.Jack was crazy, a dry angry drunk that sees ghosts, people he was once with, Llyod the bartender and Grady. Wendy enters the Ball room and there he is alone, nothing to indicate a party or any drinking. That is spooky. He is imagining that he is really having a drink and talking with Llyod. That is spooky.What happens with the new version? Other people see it, the drinks, the ghosts, etc. It doesn't make Jack crazy, like the way it should be. It makes the overlook haunted, but in poor taste. See The Haunting (1963), old and new (99 I think). There's a difference.And if a mad man is going to go off and kill someone, he does it. The end.What is with this guy talking to them for like a half an hour?!? He just goes on and on, with this mallet in his hand, just talking and giving his wife an occasional hit. Just kill her! You're a mad man. In the original version, when he was set to kill his wife, he tried exactly that. He didn't pause to go and have some ""conversation"" with her. He used an ""axe"" and chopped down the door to get to her, not a mallet.And what is this ""A couple more hits, and I think you'll get that door down."" ""care to take a few hits yourself Grady?"" WHAT!!?!? Is this some spoof/comedy? I laughed to myself when I saw that. and the quick cut on his hand from Wendy in the bathroom. It went so fast and it was so sloppy, and wait, there's Grady.""The cook is here. best to take care of him"". ""okay. um honey, you stay there. ill be right back"". I say what?! oh comedy? oh okay.and what are these ghosts doing? Guding him to kill the family? a real killer doesn't need guidance. He/she simply just does the job. Jack in the old certainly didn't need Grady telling him left and right on what to do,""Maybe you should take that bat away from Wendy"" ""Okay, I think I will."" ""she is currently reading your book, an excellent book by the way""It's stupid. and I'm thankful that wasn't in the original, new as well. you see how dumb it is? right?Do avoid this. It's done all wrong, it's way too long, too much in your face, shallow actors/actresses. Remember, I can relate to the other people. I have been with such people that had acted like Jack and who had been married to someone like Jack, a drinker. So I know it was well done; original that is; and the new was not good in any way. Again, avoid!Finally. Remember ""All work and no play makes Jac a dull boy?"" Nothing in the new version about that, not a thing. The most horrific moment in the original, and not even in the new.

Anytime a classic movie is remade, there will always be a faction that says it's sacrilege, and will hate the outcome no matter what its quality.  In some cases, that viewpoint is justified, but not with Stephen King's and Mick Garris's version of The Shining.  I'm not foolish enough to try and make the case that this movie is as good as Stanley Kubrick's because hardly anyone would agree with that.  The case I'm making is that it is mostly well-acted, convincingly told, more faithful to the novel, and entirely worth seeing if you like creepy ghost stories or are a fan of Stephen King.  Steven Weber is obviously not of the same caliber as Jack Nicholson, but he has some great moments and particularly stands out in the climax.  Rebecca De Mornay's Wendy is far less whiny and pathetic than Shelley Duvall's, and is actually blonde like the character in the book.  Mario Van Peebles is excellent as Dick Halloran, in my opinion as entertaining as Scatman Crothers.  And I think Courtland Mead does a great job as Danny.  His seizures are definitely scarier than the vibrating face employed by Danny Lloyd, and while he's not as strong an overall actor as Lloyd was, his performance is better than passable.Another big difference from Kubrick's version is using an actor for the character Tony.  I do think his acting is one of the movie's weaknesses, but you don't have to sit through the talking finger from the old movie, so it kind of evens out.  This version uses details like the Overlook's boiler that are important to the book's plot but were left out of Kubrick's film.  Also, the original ending from the novel is intact and fairly well done, with no maze chase or frozen Jack Torrance, and even though people complain about Jack using the croquet mallet instead of the axe, it's how the story was originally written.  The movie even boldly includes Jack's vicious assault on Wendy near the end in a scene of graphic violence not typically shown on major networks.  I've seen all of the numerous TV adaptations and remakes that have been attempted of Stephen King material and I think The Shining is one of the best of them.  It's not as good as the original Salem's Lot or It, but it's better than The Tommyknockers, The Langoliers, and the Carrie remake, and about as good as The Stand, Sometimes They Come Back, and Desperation.

While Kubrick obviously went barmy with King's work and made it more along the lines of a slasher film, the TV version works more on the pyschological aspects of Danny Torrence and his clairvoyant abilities to see the spirit world.As for room 217, the scene was much better than the 1980 version. We get to see the woman as she was intended, more gruesome and evil than Kubrick managed to rush to the screen in his adaptation. It's in Danny's second trip to the room where he finally realizes that the evil can and will harm you if you mess with is enough - as he did, almost tempting the hotel's evil to hurt him. I can still hear the shrill voice of the dead woman as she tells Danny, ""You have teeth!""I truly believe each version of the Shining has it's own pros and cons. For the original, Nicholson's character is more humorous than scary. Steven Weber's Jack Torrence is more aligned with the book and Rebecca DeMorney's Wendy character is more believable than Shelly Duvall's ghoulish portrayal of the woman. The frights aren't as frequent, but the one's that do strike, strike hard and leave an imprint that the 1980 version seems unable to achieve.All in all, I'd only recommend this one to King fans and those who aren't into slasher films.",4,Room 217 scene worth viewing in and of itself.,1119398400,"06 22, 2005",2005,1337,"['been', 'much', 'landblasting', 'when', 'version', 'Stephen', 'King', 'work', 'Kubrick', 'obviously', 'went', 'barmy', 'King', 'work', 'made', 'more', 'lines', 'slasher', 'film', 'TV', 'version', 'more', 'pyschological', 'aspects', 'Danny', 'Torrence', 'clairvoyant', 'abilities', 'see', 'spirit', 'world.As', 'room', '217', 'scene', 'was', 'much', 'better', '1980', 'version', 'get', 'see', 'woman', 'was', 'intended', 'more', 'gruesome', 'evil', 'Kubrick', 'managed', 'rush', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'Danny', 'second', 'trip', 'room', 'where', 'finally', 'evil', 'can', 'will', 'harm', 'mess', 'enough', 'did', 'almost', 'tempting', 'hotel', 'evil', 'hurt', 'can', 'still', 'hear', 'shrill', 'voice', 'dead', 'woman', 'Danny', 'have', 'teeth', 'truly', 'believe', 'version', 'Shining', 'own', 'pros', 'cons', 'original', 'Nicholson', 'character', 'more', 'humorous', 'scary', 'Steven', 'Weber', 'Jack', 'Torrence', 'more', 'aligned', 'book', 'Rebecca', 'DeMorney', 'Wendy', 'character', 'more', 'believable', 'Shelly', 'Duvall', 'ghoulish', 'portrayal', 'woman', 'frights', 'are', ""n't"", 'frequent', 'one', 'do', 'strike', 'strike', 'hard', 'leave', 'imprint', '1980', 'version', 'unable', 'achieve.All', ""'d"", 'only', 'recommend', 'one', 'King', 'fans', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'slasher', 'films']",Stephen King's The Shining

724832,A1VZLLDNLURGJB,B000077VRT,Keith Mirenberg,"[1, 1]","I feel that this remake may have been more like Steven King's original concept but fell short of Stanley Kubrick's screen vision.  I read the original story years before seeing the Kubrick version and agree it is almost a different story.  However, I really feel that Kubrick's film was superior.After inspecting the Amazon votes for both films I noticed that out of a sample size of something like 800 for the Kubrick film, it received approximately 4.5 stars from the larger movie going public. This version received a significantly lower score from a much smaller sample size, despite the  fact that the majority were probably fans of Steven King.  I also felt that Jack Torrence was played by a very inferior actor in the King version of the film which may actually have ruined the film for me.I generally find that the movies made for TV miniseries are a little slow moving because of the timing imposed by the format.  Although not terribly important, the make up and special effects in the King version of the film were also a bit inferior, but not too bad for a made for TV movie. If I had to be critical of one special effect in particular it would be the animated hedges omitted from the Kubric film. I am, nevertheless, glad for having had the opportunity to see this remake, and rate it at four well earned stars.",4,The Shining by Steven King (1997),1246838400,"07 6, 2009",2009,1325,"['feel', 'remake', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'Steven', 'King', 'original', 'concept', 'fell', 'short', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'screen', 'vision', 'read', 'original', 'story', 'years', 'seeing', 'Kubrick', 'version', 'agree', 'almost', 'different', 'story', 'However', 'really', 'feel', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'was', 'superior.After', 'inspecting', 'Amazon', 'votes', 'films', 'noticed', 'sample', 'size', 'something', '800', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'received', 'approximately', '4.5', 'stars', 'larger', 'movie', 'going', 'public', 'version', 'received', 'significantly', 'lower', 'score', 'much', 'smaller', 'sample', 'size', 'fact', 'majority', 'were', 'probably', 'fans', 'Steven', 'King', 'also', 'felt', 'Jack', 'Torrence', 'was', 'played', 'very', 'inferior', 'actor', 'King', 'version', 'film', 'may', 'actually', 'have', 'ruined', 'film', 'me.I', 'generally', 'find', 'movies', 'made', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'are', 'little', 'slow', 'moving', 'timing', 'imposed', 'format', 'not', 'terribly', 'important', 'make', 'up', 'special', 'effects', 'King', 'version', 'film', 'were', 'also', 'bit', 'inferior', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'had', 'be', 'critical', 'one', 'special', 'effect', 'particular', 'would', 'be', 'animated', 'hedges', 'omitted', 'Kubric', 'film', 'am', 'nevertheless', 'glad', 'having', 'had', 'opportunity', 'see', 'remake', 'rate', 'four', 'well', 'earned', 'stars']",Stephen King's The Shining

724841,A2LJKDPRVR907S,B000077VRT,Lisa Siegel,"[1, 2]","Let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan of the 1980 Stanley Kubrick's The Shining.  No one can ever top Jack Nicholson's ""Here's Johnny!""  Nor can anyone top his performance.Naturally when I heard that a made for TV movie version was going to air on ABC over the course of three nights, a total of six hours, I was VERY interested.  I knew from the start that this was going to truly be based on the book, especially since the title is Stephen King's The Shining.  I'm really happy that he decided to not remake the movie (you really can't remake the 1980 version!) but instead give viewers who either haven't read the book a great story or viewers who have read the book a chance to 'see' what they read.  Sure not EVERYTHING from the book is here, but in order to do that, they'd have to broadcast this on cable, not ABC.I was very happy with what I saw.  Not only was the acting great, but the story was excellent.  Instead of seeing Jack basically crazy throughout the entire movie (mini-series in this case), you see a loving father and husband who is battling alcoholism and who gradually, thanks to a haunted hotel, goes crazy.  That was probably one of the best plot points.  Jack Torrance in the book loved his son and his wife, even at the very end.What is really interesting is the fact that this was filmed in Estes Park, Colorado which is where the Stanley Hotel is located.  King and his wife stayed at this hotel and it's where he got the inspiration to write The Shining and much of the filming was done there.  I'm not sure, but I think he may have stayed in room 217.  I've never been there but I bet that room is probably booked all the time.Onto the acting.  Of course no one is going to 'replace' Jack Nicholson.  That's darn near impossible to do.  But I must give props to Steven Weber.  I was really skeptical at first when I heard he was going to be playing Jack.  I had really only seen him in the sitcom Wings.  But wow!  This guy was really able to do drama/horror/suspense.Rebecca De Mornay was a great Wendy.  From the commentary by Stephen King, she is exactly who he had envisioned as Wendy on screen.  There were times where I thought she was a little boring and looked as though she was really trying a little to hard to bring her character's fear of the hotel to life.The only person I didn't exactly care for was Courtland Mead who played Danny.  His acting was pretty good but what really irritated me was the fact that he very rarely closed his mouth!  The expressions on his face were sometimes bland and kind of expressionless, especially when he had his visions.  It almost looked as though he wasn't scared...you really couldn't tell what he was feeling until he actually said it.All in all, I'm really happy with this version.  Even though the special effects are only so-so you have to remember that it was made for television and of course the effects aren't going to be as good as what you see in a movie theater.  And the acting was toned down compared to the 1980 version.  But I'm not comparing the two since you really can't; they are literally two separate movies, both very well done.  It would have been really neat to have Stephen King work with Stanley Kubrick in The Shining.  I would have really loved to see the two of them work on it or any other Stephen King novel.If you're a Stephen King fan and you love the novel of The Shining, you will really appreciate this version.

It is about a recovering alchoholic writer named Jack Torrance(Steven Weber) who applys for a job as a Winter caretaker for the isolated Overlook Hotel. He hears from the manager Mr. Ullman(Elliot Gould) that a man named Grady murdered his wife and two daughters with an ax and a shotgun. Jack takes his wife Wendy(Rebecca De Mornay) and his psychic son Danny(Courtland Mead) up to stay with him. When they get up there, Danny and the cook Dick Hallorann(Melvin Van Peebles) have a talk about a psychic ability called ""the shining"". He tells Danny that if danger strikes, call for help by using the shining. After everyone leaves, the family seems to get along great. Until, weird things start to happen to Jack and Danny. Jack runs into Delbert Grady(Stanley Anderson) and hotel legend Harry Derwent(John Durbin)! Danny, with the help of his psychic friend Tony(Wil Horneff), deciedes to shine Hallorann for help and that makes Hallorann is the only one who can help Danny and Wendy.It is hard to compare this version to the Stanley Kubrick version. Jack Nicholson IS Jack Torrance, you can't argue with that, but I liked Steven Weber okay. Rebecca De Mornay was as good as Shelley Duvall, although I don't know how she could put up with all of Jack's nonsense. Courtland Mead was not as good as Danny Lloyd. It's too bad that he quit acting, I thought that he was pretty good for a little kid.

724844,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B000077VRT,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[2, 3]","What makes these Stephen King made-for-TV miniseries' so much fun? Could it be the plot, the characters, or the absolute absurdity of them all? Maybe all the above? ""The Shining,"" a 1997 ABC miniseries is no exception, and possibly one of the best King adaptations so far. If a 4 and a half hour movie is watched in one sitting and feels like 2 hours, then it must be good. And ""The Shining"" is definitely good. Steven Webber, Rebecca De Mornay and Courtland Mead are superb in their roles as the Torrance family, an Elliot Gould has a fun cameo as the manager of the Overlook Hotel. A more faithful adaptation of the King novel than the 1980 Kubrick film, I cannot say which is better because they both have their redeeming qualities, and they are both equally fascinating. Steven Webber is no Jack Nicholson, but he gives such a chilling performance. I believed him as Jack Torrance, and frankly, I was freaked out. Weber convincingly humanizes his character, and wonderfully conveys all of the conflicts that are brewing up inside him--his struggle with alcoholism, the desperate need to be a good father since he didn't have one, and his desire to succeed in life despite his father's criticism. De Mornay is perhaps a better Wendy than Shelley Duvall ever was, but Courtland Mead (although good) cannot compare to the performance of Danny Lloyd as the original Danny. I did like many aspects of this version better--the fleshed out characters, delving into the hotel's past (and its haunting), and of course, the hedge animals and wasp nest, which made great additions to the story (I'm sure they were in the book). Of course, the sappy ending to this version doesn't work very well, and the running time becomes a bit tedious toward the end, but overall, the movie is great, all the more due to Webber being so convincingly chilling when he starts to slowly go insane.

This version of the movie is much longer than the Nicholson version, and for fans of King's novel, this will probably be the film adaptation that you prefer simply because it follows the book so closely.  Steven Weber plays the role of Jack much differently than Nicholson did: like in the novel, the character's maddness is slow to build, but when the film reaches its climax, Weber is absolutely terrifying.  Rebecca De Mornay gives the performance of her career as Wendy, a woman who is desperately trying to keep her family together and is slowly coming to realize the horror that has possessed her husband.  They young actor who plays Danny gives a chilling performance, and he always gives me the creeps when I watch the film (I can only assume that's because the kid's a great actor, hopefully not because he's a freak in real life).  The film builds and builds, and there are a lot of suspenseful moments.  The scene with Danny in the snow where the bushes come to life is probably my favorite scene in the film, and it's especially enjoyable because it was omitted from the Nicholson version entirely.

And, I can't help but wonder just what Mr Kubrick was so worried about that he took so long to allow Stephen King the right do his own version of the book. Then, you only have to watch the two films (after reading the book), and all questions are answered.Don't mistake me - I greatly enjoyed Kubrick's interpretation of The Shining. Particularly Danny's encounters with the ghosts of the previous caretaker's creepy daughters.It's unfortunate in some ways that Kubrick's version was only minutely faithful to the original story. Most of it was pure fabrication on his part. Still, perhaps that's a blessing. It just emphasises even more how wonderful and refreshing it was to see Stephen King's adaption.There are plenty of points for comparison to prove how much better the latter version is, and I'm not talking about special effects here. The wall of blood crashing down through the hallway well and truly scared me the first time I saw it, and I had to freeze-frame the VCR to get a good look at the massacred images of the two little girls.However...Firstly, it was totally refreshing to see Tony portrayed as a proper character, rather than Danny Lloyd pretending that his finger was talking to him. And Courtland Mead's performances each time Danny went into a self-induced trance were riveting - especially the very first one of the movie. The revelation that Tony was really just a representation of Danny's older self was also a nice touch. It also makes sense - it would be far less threatening to Danny's sanity to think that the apparition appearing to him to warn him of danger was someone else entirely, rather than an older version of himself.Further, Courtland Mead's all-round performance and portrayal of Danny Torrance was spot on. He is so convincing in the way he portrays a scared little boy who doesn't always know what is the right thing to do. His defiance in trying to prove he isn't frightened of the apparitions the hotel is producing is very believable, and his love for (and fear of) his father is even more so. And, his confusion about his awesome gifts is powerfully realistic.For example, his reaction when Dick Halloran reassures him that, should there be any trouble, all he needs to do is call out with his mind, is highly emotional. He gives a strong impression of a child who, knowing he is in a potentially terrifying situation, has just seen the light at the end of a very black tunnel.Rebecca DeMornay is wonderful as Wendy Torrance. She so accurately portrayed a loving wife and mother who is still recovering from the horror of living with a violent alcoholic. Her apprehension around Jack - particularly where Danny is involved - is all too real. She does a magnificent job of playing a woman who, while loving her husband dearly and trying to help him all she can, is still frightened of him, at least on a subconscious level.Unlike Shelley Duvall in Kubrick's version, DeMornay does not present a Wendy Torrance who is feeble and pathetic, and to be pitied. Rather, her Wendy Torrance is a woman to be admired, and respected. The fight she puts up against Jack towards the end of the film is strongly indicative of this. Where I recall Duvall cowering in a corner and screaming hysterically (okay, I admit I'd probably do that myself in a similar situation), DeMornay's Wendy shows strength of character to put up a fight, even though physically harming her husband obviously galled her a great deal.As for Steven Weber... Words fail to fully describe the incredible performance given by this actor. The whole story of The Shining was supposed to revolve around the family relationship of the Torrances, with focus primarily on Jack and Danny as the Overlook's main targets. Steven Weber was truly brilliant as a man constantly teetering on the brink of oblivion, struggling to maintain his dignity and self-respect as a husband and father in the wake of a life wasted on alcohol abuse.It was chilling to watch Jack's gradual descent into madness, as portrayed by Weber. It was a stark contrast to the sulky, sullen presence of Jack Nicholson throughout Kubrick's version. Although I agree that Nicholson is brilliant as an actor, I also agree with another reviewer. Nicholson was the wrong choice for the role of Jack Torrance. Right from the start, he gave the impression that he'd already lost his mind, and was spending the entire film just waiting for the right moment to grab the axe and go beserk.Weber's performance was far more subtle than that of Nicholson. Perhaps more time to explore the personality of Jack Torrance might have had something to do with this, but I also believe that King deserves much credit for producing a screenplay that allowed for it.Although I knew exactly what was going to happen, I still sat through the entire thing hoping that Jack would come to his senses, realise what was going on, and get himself and his family out of there. Of course, that was never going to happen, but I think it was wonderful that the film was able to draw those sorts of emotions from the viewer.I think that is the thing that really sets Stephen King's version apart from Stanley Kubrick's. With Kubrick's version, you are merely an observer. There's no effort to really draw the viewer in. It gives a few chills and thrills, but there is no real emotion. King's screenplay draws you in right from the beginning, and holds you right until the final scenes.Though Stanley Kubrick's film was fine in its own right, it is not, and never will be a patch on Stephen King's magnificent adaption.And, for the record, there was nothing corny about the ending. It was a nice touch that Jack was redeemed right at the end, and his brief appearance at Danny's graduation was nothing short of heartwarming. It was also a nice touch to add the image of the sign promising to rebuild the Overlook - though God-willing no one will ever commit the travesty of making a sequel.",5,So much better than Kubrick's

Not to say that Stanley Kubrick's version of The Shining was bad, it's just that it's great to see different versions and a version that is true to the book. Kubrick's version was pure psychological horror, where this one is pure haunted house horror.The movie is about a family that go up in the mountains of Colorado. The father is the caretaker for the Overlook Hotel for the winter season, which has a bad history of murder and corruption. As the movie progresses we see the hotel starting to take affect in Jack Torrance's life (played by Steven Weber, but not as good as Jack Nicholson), making him see the ghosts of the Overlook Hotel. The ghosts want Jack's son, Danny, who has The Shining. The ghosts are basically using Jack to gain support of this strong boy with his strong powers. The movie is not as scary as Kubrick's version, but you still get a sense of eerie hauntings. But, I have to admit, when Steven Weber wacks down the door with the croquet mallet, that would scare ...me if I was Wendy in that bathroom. So, if you read the novel then you will probably enjoy this version of The Shining and then compare the two. It's a fun movie with interesting sequences and material in it.

724860,A20NJAPECFGIR9,B000077VRT,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[4, 6]","Some folks will always be prejudiced against a film that's a remake.  This was a great version of the book and what was best is the fact that Stephen King was able to do the film the way he wanted to. So many film adaptations of books suck so it's good to see one being told how the writer intended it to be.  The first film was remarkable and a classic horror that's become the mold of many after it. But that's not to say this version wasn't remarkable in its own right. Stephen Weber may not have Jack Nicholson's finesse but he does a wonderful job as Jack Torrence. Stephen impressed me with this role. Since the sitcom &quot; Wings &quot; I didn't expect much from him.  He proved me wrong and he'll prove you wrong too if you've prejudged this film before seeing it.Granted this film is not as scary as the first UNTIL the end. This one was made in 97' so it relies on special effects they didn't have in 80' when the original film was made. The effects didn't bring much to the film. If it hadn't been for Weber's wonderful acting this would have been a horrible remake. I love Rebecca DeMornay but didn't buy her as Wendy at all. She is a better actress than Shelley Devall on any day, but Rebecca just wasn't this character.  The little boy that played Doc was cute but unconvincing.  The first little boy was more charming and made the part of Danny his own.I would definitely say give this a chance especially if you liked the first film. Watch it just to compare it to the other versions. This may not be in the calibur of the first but it is definitely not far behind.

724862,AP9LTXNHPI42F,B000077VRT,NorthernBelle,"[25, 39]","Stanley Kubrick was a film artist. I am not sure what Stephen King is when it comes to film, but I do not believe he is someone who respects it as an art form.Kubrick's film is rich in themes and motifs: Doubling, repetition, lights, mazes, mirroring, Indians, Europeans, white settlers, the American flag. King's films, by comparison, are all what-you-see-is-what-you-get.This one is no different. Everything is pointed out and spelled out as if the audience is too dumb to discern anything that isn't. To be sure, with Kubrick's version there have been connections made and meanings inferred that were merely the result of accident or continuity error, but I would rather watch a movie that gives me a reason to wonder about something that may or may not be there than a movie that leaves me with nothing to wonder about at all.Kubrick's Shining is terrifying and a straight descent into madness. King's Shining is a soap opera. It's Leave It To Beaver meets Casper The Unfriendly Ghost.The Timberline Lodge, which Kubrick used for the exterior of his hotel, looks like a place where a madman might dwell and seems remote and isolated long before the snow has begun to fall. King's pretty white hotel is a picture on a postcard.Kubrick's elevator gushes a torrent of reddish-black blood. King's elevator gushes confetti and underwear.217 v. 237. This scene scared me about as badly as taking my child shopping at the Halloween Superstore in October. And how hard is it to scare a child? Film Bathtub Woman scared the s--- out of an axe-murderer! Series Jack leaned against the wall and rattled an aspirin bottle. Did she give him a headache?The hedge animals in King's movie could have been effective. Did they just move? Maybe they did or maybe they didn't. Maybe the hotel is starting to get to Jack and he imagined it all. But the scene is spoiled by playground objects that do come to life while you're watching them.Assuming we live in a world where psychics exist, part of the intrigue for non-psychics is in imagining what it is like to experience psychic phenomenon, not knowing what it is like. Now I know; it's someone shouting inside your head. How original. Dick jumps around like he is being tasered, his nose bleeds, and bystanders fuss over him. Compare these antics with the look of sheer terror that spreads slowly over Crothers' face; it is the horror of the hotel that Crothers reacts to, not what Danny says or how loudly he says it.Weber comes across like a bad comedian for most of the movie. It is painful to watch a B-actor trying to be scary and failing miserably at it. At times this looks more like a parody of a horror movie: i.e., Series Jack making ""bonking"" noises as he pretends to hit himself in the side of the head with the mallet and then joking about Dick being ""a publisher's clearing house winner.""We are told that De Mornay's Wendy is a Strong Womyn of the 90s. So how does that help the movie? If she's tough and she can take care of herself and her son, then why I am supposed to be afraid for her? De Mornay said of her role that Wendy ""is a woman of power and intelligence."" The implication apparently being that Duvall's Wendy was weak and stupid. De Mornay broke a bottle on Jack's head, kicked him in the nuts, and sliced his hand with a razor blade. Duvall hit Jack in the head with a baseball bat, sent him tumbling head over heels down the stairs, sprained his ankle, and sliced his hand with a kitchen knife. I'd say they're even. To boot, Duvall found her son and got them both into the snow cat and away from the hotel to safety, and she did it without anyone's help. De Mornay had only a wooden mallet to worry about and she needed Dick O'Halloren to rescue her. So I don't get how De Mornay supposedly topped Duvall. Plus, Duvall actually looked SCARED during in her role whereas De Mornay did not.De Mornay yells, threatens, accuses, and nags almost the entire length of the movie. ""Daddy finally got tired of her spiteful, cowardly nagging and decided to take her to school..."" Can you blame him?King's Danny is also unsympathetic. Courtland Mead, despite being repeatedly hollered at by his dry-drunk father and warned by Tony who conveniently pops up in front of him, busts into Ullman's office, steals the keys and bullheadedly goes where he knows he is not supposed to go. ""I'll go in here if I want! Go away! Leave me alone!"" alternating with daddy-daddy-snivel-scenes thrown in to make Weber look like an ogre. (Why can't the college professor figure out to just put the passkeys somewhere where his son won't find them?)What does movie Danny do after the bathtub lady tries to strangle him? He becomes catatonic. He retreats so far into himself that he can longer communicate except via Tony in his finger. And what does series Danny do right after receiving the worst horror of his young life? He dangles his legs off the kitchen table and smiles and tells his mommy and daddy how much he likes hot chocolate.More reasons Mead is annoying:  This ""extraordinary"" child with ""the drive of a grad student"" is struggling to learn to read at any age (7) when most children already have, and he (oops!) breaks character when he thinks the camera is no longer filming him as he runs from the room.And why is it that King takes one cheesy line and makes the actors repeat it over and over and over? Get down here and take your medicine! Damn nosey little pup! Kissin', kissin, that's what I've been missin'! Just like pictures in a book! In film Shining Danny Lloyd said ""just like pictures in a book"" one time. Once. And that was enough. Zero times would have been enough for others. And zero would have been enough times for this remake to be done.",1,King's flop makes Kubrick's masterpiece shine,1216684800,"07 22, 2008",2008,5709,"['Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'film', 'artist',

724863,A3LQAL04COLWW6,B000077VRT,Notelexxsenob,"[3, 3]","This TV miniseries is much closer to King's book than the Kubrick enigma.  The story is about a recovering alcoholic named Jack Torrance who is put in charge of a winter resort known as the Overlook Hotel.  The hotel was often a haven for severely immoral guests who now spiritually inhabit the hotel as ghosts in sort of a hotel purgatory.  Torrance's young son, Danny, has a sort of an ESP described as ""the shining"" by the hotel's chef who shares this mental gift.  The ghosts in the hotel manipulate the hot tempered and emotionally unstable Jack Torrance to get him to attempt to kill his son Danny beacause once dead, Danny would reside with the ghosts who would use his special ability to strengthen their manifestations.Unlike the feature film, the story delves into the background of the characters more substantially.  We learn a lot about Jack's childhood, employment failures, struggles with alcohol and rocky marriage to his wife Wendy.  By fleshing out the character of Jack Torrance we can sympathize with his transformation from merely a man with major problems to a crazed man possessed by evil.  We also learn of the deep love for his wife and son which, though buried beneath his darker side, is still powerful enough to help him attempt to overcome the evil spirits.  In the end we view Jack as a tortured soul who we feel sorry for.The movie is certainly not without faults and it can drag at times but it is worth seeing.",3,If You Want a Version Closer to the Book...This is It,1219017600,"08 18, 2008",2008,1443,"['TV', 'much', 'closer', 'King', 'book', 'Kubrick', 'enigma', 'story', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'named', 'Jack', 'Torrance', 'who', 'put', 'charge', 'winter', 'resort', 'known', 'Overlook', 'Hotel', 'hotel', 'was', 'often', 'haven', 'severely', 'immoral', 'guests', 'who', 'now', 'spiritually', 'inhabit', 'hotel', 'ghosts', 'sort', 'hotel', 'purgatory', 'Torrance', 'young', 'son', 'Danny', 'sort', 'ESP', 'described', 'shining', 'hotel', 'chef', 'who', 'shares', 'mental', 'gift', 'ghosts', 'hotel', 'manipulate', 'hot', 'tempered', 'emotionally', 'unstable', 'Jack', 'Torrance', 'get', 'attempt', 'kill', 'son', 'Danny', 'beacause', 'once', 'dead', 'Danny', 'would', 'reside', 'ghosts', 'who', 'would', 'use', 'special', 'ability', 'strengthen', 'feature', 'film', 'story', 'background', 'characters', 'more', 'substantially', 'learn', 'lot', 'Jack', 'childhood', 'employment', 'failures', 'struggles', 'alcohol', 'rocky', 'marriage', 'wife', 'Wendy', 'fleshing', 'out', 'character', 'Jack', 'Torrance', 'can', 'sympathize', 'transformation', 'merely', 'man', 'major', 'problems', 'crazed', 'man', 'possessed', 'evil', 'also', 'learn', 'deep', 'love', 'wife', 'son', 'buried', 'darker', 'side', 'still', 'powerful', 'enough', 'help', 'attempt', 'overcome', 'evil', 'spirits', 'end', 'view', 'Jack', 'tortured', 'soul', 'who', 'feel', 'sorry', 'for.The', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'faults', 'can', 'drag', 'times', 'worth', 'seeing']",Stephen King's The Shining

Neither is the direction. But it works well enough.As opposed to most people, I believe that Steven Weber was an excellent choice for Jack Torrance. He was able to pull of a very human version of Jack. I really liked that. This was a major part of the original book that was missing in the Stanley Kubrick version. I don't care what anyone says, that was one of the most important elements of the book. Without it the story...feels empty and pointless. Besides Weber, the rest of the acting was so so, not great.It's a very fun movie to watch. I actually find myself watching it every time it's on TV and when I need something fun to watch.

724865,AJUEE2C2EJ0V3,B000077VRT,Paperbackstash,"[7, 7]","When you're bringing a book to the big screen you can't leave everything in it or it becomes tiresome. For some reason King likes to make his movies way too long and this is one of the setbacks of this particular mini.While Steven Weber did a good job no one could beat Jack Nicholson. While it is true that he acted crazy a bit too fast, his acting in the first version was excellent. Weber did a great job too and looked eerie as hell in the end but his personality wasn't as enjoyable. And his dialogue sucks!! ""Come take your medicine pup??!?!?""Rebecca DeMornay is a talented actress (loved her in the hand that rocks the cradle) but she wasn't right for this part. Her and the boy had no chemistry until about half way through. Her character was stronger than Shelley Duvalls' but they may have made her a bit too much, while having Jack a little too passive and whipped. Shelleys submissiveness was pretty extreme but it helped the plot and caused a bigger cheering when the timid rabbit whacked her hubby with the baseball bat.The little boy was awful - he overacted and overdramatized everything. I didn't find him well casted at all and the scenes with him were painful. I couldnt get into the movie when he was around because I was too busy being shocked out of my trance listening to him talk. Holloran is simply a plot device used to fill space.The ending was not in the original OR the book - and it was a little too happy-go-lucky. Cheesy and rivals Disney productions.From the VERY beginning we have the hotel doing wierd shit by moving objects, ect, everytime someone leaves the room. Boy does it get tiresome! The worst way to try and evoke fear in someone. By putting it straight in their face from the start and being so damned obvious. Like when they leave the old cash register pops up the no sale sign. WTF?? And how many doors need to close by themselves?The hedge animals were an awesome idea. Originally Kurbick wanted to use them but he couldnt get the effects to work so opted for the maze instead. I was stoked on finally seeing these hedge animals but was sorely dissapointed. They look like cheap CGI and are horribly unconvincing. After thought, I decided I prefered the maze. It was used to heighten tension in the original and mazes are pretty creative. I may have liked the hedge animals more if they had been made to appear more intense.Another problem was ""Tony"". In the Kubrick version he was in the boys mouth, and we didnt see him. We just saw the kid go into a wierd trance and use his finger to talk in a different voice. We didnt know if he was nuts, if someone *was* there, if this person was responsible for the shining, ect. In this movie they use an actual person - and a flat acting one at that. With glasses and short hair and no expression. He says obvious things just to insult the audiences intelligence even more. And he seems to have very little influence on Danny.Sometimes mystery is good. Here everything - every twist and turn - is explained way too much and in intricate detail. I felt like a 3rd grader learning about the history of haunted houses.And how could they butcher the significance of Redrum so horribly? In the movie during Dannys trances (the original) and the book it was said as a wierd word and at the end it is shown in the mirror to spell ""murder"". Here they just said it for the heck of it, because they thought people loved hearing the word, and it was overused and any significance lost.Since this was a TV mini the violence, any disturbing images, blood, anything is watered down so much it contains NOTHING serious for adult fans.Also in the original you can take Jacks madness from either the hotel causing it or the point of isolation and cabin fever. Here there's only one answer fed to us on a silver spoon: ITS ALL ABOUT THE HOTEL.I prefer the more human-relatedapproach.

724866,A3GUWZBZ2L5PPC,B000077VRT,Paul Buford,"[4, 6]","A careful reading of Mr. King's books will show that a loving relationship is often at their center.  ""Cujo"" is one, but ""The Shining"" is the best example.The heart of the book, and this adaptation, is a family.  What makes the horror all the worse is that this is a family in crisis.  This is their last desperate chance to make a ""go"" of it.  Jack MUST be sucessful as the caretaker of the Overbrook.  He MUST stay sober and finish the play.  If he doesn't, his family breaks up.  You empathize with he and his family's situation:  This is what makes it transcend the ""mad slasher"" genre, where the characters are pawns.I think this is why most people of who have read King's book dislike Kubrick's movie.  Kubrick's movie is all cold, icy and frankly, nasty.  The book and this adaptation despite the blood and gore has a warm heart.The engine that drives this plot and characters is the strong, fierce love that exists between Danny and his father.  Danny's psychic sense tells him that the Overlook is place of horrible danger (his 'imaginary friend' Tony keeps showing him signs of this.)  His psychic sense is also telling him how important this job is to his father and his family.  Danny and his father stay at the hotel because they must to keep the family going. There is a horrible reinforcing cycle developing here.  The hotel is using Danny's psychic ablity to energize itself and drive his father to homicidal mania.  Jack at least initially, is staying in danger for Danny and his wife's sake.This is far clearer in the book, whose narrative is from Danny's POV much of the time.  Kubrick chose to throw all of this out to concentrate on Jack's growing homicidal madness.  In this adaptation, King makes a valiant attempt to dramatize Danny's courage and loyalty to his father as the hotel transforms him into a monster.  He mostly carries it off, but I think this would be impossible for just about any child actor. This child actor is just not up to the task. Steven Weber does an incredible job of showing the agony Jack is going through as he fights off the hotel's attempts to use him to kill the family he loves.The climatic scene of Jack's (seeming) annihilation at his own hands to save his son's life is as effective for its sentimentality as it is for its horror.I much prefer this version to Kubrick's.",4,This adaptation tries to catch the love,1096502400,"09 30, 2004",2004,2329,"['careful', 'reading', 'Mr.', 'King', 'books', 'will', 'show', 'loving', 'relationship', 'often', 'center', 'Cujo', 'one', 'Shining', 'best', 'example.The', 'heart', 'book', 'adaptation', 'family', 'What', 'horror', 'worse', 'family', 'crisis', 'last', 'desperate', 'chance', 'make', 'go', 'Jack', 'MUST', 'be', 'sucessful', 'caretaker', 'Overbrook', 'MUST', 'stay', 'sober', 'finish', 'play', ""n't"", 'family', 'up', 'empathize', 'family', 'situation', 'transcend', 'mad', 'slasher', 'genre', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'pawns.I', 'think', 'why', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'King', 'book', 'dislike', 'Kubrick', 'movie', 'Kubrick', 'movie', 'cold', 'icy', 'frankly', 'nasty', 'book', 'adaptation', 'blood', 'gore', 'warm', 'heart.The', 'engine', 'plot', 'characters', 'strong', 'fierce', 'love', 'Danny', 'father', 'Danny', 'psychic', 'sense', 'Overlook', 'place', 'horrible', 'danger', ""'imaginary"", 'friend', 'Tony', 'keeps', 'showing', 'signs', 'psychic', 'sense', 'also', 'telling', 'how', 'important', 'job', 'father', 'family', 'Danny', 'father', 'stay', 'hotel', 'must', 'keep', 'family', 'going', 'horrible', 'reinforcing', 'cycle', 'developing', 'here', 'hotel', 'using', 'Danny', 'psychic', 'ablity', 'energize', 'drive', 'father', 'homicidal', 'mania', 'Jack', 'least', 'initially', 'staying', 'danger', 'Danny', 'wife', 'sake.This', 'far', 'clearer', 'book', 'narrative', 'Danny', 'POV', 'much', 'time', 'Kubrick', 'chose', 'throw', 'concentrate', 'Jack', 'growing', 'homicidal', 'madness', 'adaptation', 'King', 'valiant', 'attempt', 'dramatize', 'Danny', 'courage', 'loyalty', 'father', 'hotel', 'monster', 'mostly', 'off', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'just', 'child', 'actor', 'child', 'actor', 'just', 'not', 'up', 'task', 'Steven', 'Weber', 'incredible', 'job', 'showing', 'agony', 'Jack', 'going', 'hotel', 'attempts', 'use', 'kill', 'family', 'climatic', 'scene', 'Jack', 'seeming', 'annihilation', 'own', 'hands', 'save', 'son', 'life', 'effective', 'sentimentality', 'horror.I', 'much', 'prefer', 'version', 'Kubrick']",Stephen King's The Shining

724869,A4DTOO95QUGQT,B000077VRT,"Randall Brooks ""Author""","[9, 11]","What in the world was Stephen King thinking when he made this 5 hour travesty? Or better yet, what wasn't he thinking? He threw everything and the kitchen sink in this, yet sadly nothing stuck. I know he openly detested Stanley Kubrick's 1980 masterpiece, a stunning classic of cerebral horror on a grand scale that has yet to ever be equaled. But, was that a reason to defile your own work, Stephen, and try to readapt it - and for television at that? The answer is a resounding no!From the start, King and director Mick Garris do everything wrong, from the opening shot of Jack Torrance in the boiler room with Watson, to the horrendous outdoor scene of people still at the hotel playing croquet. WTF? So much for creating any sense of isolation. Yes, you can forget any kind of feeling of anyone being isolated, killing any further buildup of feelings of claustrophobia and doom.Oh, and also let me mention how pretty much from the get-go, King butchers his own novel. Yes, he made changes that would even stump Stanley Kubrick, who performed plastic surgery on the novel in his awesome adaption; and rightly so. Number one, it is mentioned that Grady was at the Overlook ALONE when he killed himself. That's right. By himself. No wife. No twin girls. No family at all. Just him. Not the way I remember it from the book. And I've read the book so many times over the years, I've lost count. And King wanted to badmouth Kubrick for the changes HE made when adapting the novel. Ok, makes sense...NOT.Then, if all that isn't bad enough, director Garrison keeps throwing in these senseless flashbacks that do nothing but dumb the story down to the umpteenth degree. You know, like they do on the ""CSI"" shows, you know, because they feel people are too stupid to follow what's been said, so they have to show you as well as tell you. And it robs the movie of any kind of suspense right off the bat.One of the things I really liked in the novel, and oddly enough never thought about being changed in the Kubrick film was the way Danny talked to Tony. In the novel, he talked to an older version of himself, who hovered nearby and showed him visions of things to come. Neat idea. In the Kubrick film, Danny simply talked to his finger, his imaginary friend, the little boy who lives in his mouth. A great idea visually. Well, in this version, as another reviewer so well stated, Danny talks to a floating teenager. And it looks hokey as h*ll. Dreadful.And, again, as if other things that dumbed down this version wasn't enough, they feel the need to remind you that Jack Torrance is/was an alcoholic, and he had a ""problem"", and he hurt Danny, and he lost his teaching job because of his drinking problem every chance they get. Which is like every five minutes. Telling the audience one time isn't enough. Oh no. They obviously felt the audience was too dumb to get that, so they felt the need to throw it in as many times as possible so you would, you know, get it. Dreadful.And, speaking of that reminds me of something I had never questioned before until now: I've seen so many reviewers talk about how they didn't like Jack Nicholson in the Kubrick version because it was obvious from the beginning that he was insane. Well, I noticed in this that because of the way it keeps reminding the viewer that Jack Torrance is an alcoholic, and that he once hurt Danny, and has a history of violence, well, right there tells you that he is going to eventually lose it when he gets to the hotel and gets snowed in during the winter, killing any and all suspense. You know, now that I think about, the novel even did that. Heck, if King wanted his readers (and viewers in the film here) to be totally surprised when Jack gets possessed and starts to go after his family with a croquet mallet, well then why not make him a saintly person with a very good background in the beginning. Heck, make him a preacher or something with a pristine background. Someone who would never dream of going off on a mad binge and hurting someone. Now, that would be a surprise!Anyways.And, I will slightly mention since I'm talking about certain characters/cast members, another heavy criticism I've heard over the years against the Kubrick film I've never understood was against the great Shelley Duvall as Wendy Torrance, a role I feel she was simply brilliant in. Well, over the years, I've read negative reviews talk about how she was so wrong for the role, how she was too whiny and too weak, blah blah blah.Well, here's the deal. Sure, Rebecca DeMornay is more like the novel Wendy, however, visually on film, I just don't buy that a woman that strong would be with a man like Jack. Nope. Never. Not in a million years. She would beat the h*ll out of him, set him on fire, cuss him until he cried, and make him her little b**ch. True story.Thus, making her all wrong for the role filmwise. But she's the best actor in the whole thing. Yeah, I said it, and I meant it. I really liked Courtland Mead's small part in the movie ""Go"", but he is completely wasted here. I blame it on bad direction. And that goes for the performance of everyone else in this. Awful. Atrocious. And I blame it on bad direction from Garris. Watch anyone of them in something else. Heck, watch something else than this alltogether, and you will be better off.Anyways, even though King made some other questionable changes from his novel in this, I will give it two stars for at least being somewhat as close as it can be. I still prefer the Kubrick version. Always have. Always will. Especially after seeing this stinker.Thanks for reading.Randall Brooks(author, ""The Two Worlds of the Mind"")PS: Anyone else ever notice the similarities between ""The Shining"" and ""The Amityville

Baybusky ""stonecutter""","[0, 2]","To all fans of The Shining,please be advised,that although Stephen did make some changes,this is, by far, the better telling of the story! It's much closer to the book and Steven Weber makes a better Jack Torrance. Nicholson seemed crazy right out of the gate,Weber seems like a tormented man,not so much crazy as broken. That is what Jack Torrance is all about. Hell,even Elliot Gould is a better hotel manager! I do miss Scatman Crothers alot,he was the only casting in the original that simply couldn't be beat! Also Stephen King wrote a haunted house story,Kubrick made a film that had very little to do with the Overlook Hotel. It's not that Kubrick's film is bad,it's just not the book Stephen wrote. I know Stephen took some stuff out,just so it wouldn't be too much like the film,esp Grady who isn't a main player like he is in the film or the two little girls (by far the scariest thing in Kubrick's film,which probably explains their absence here,Kubrick got those right!)but you get the scrapbooks and the hedge animals. You also get a real sense of Jack's coming apart at the seams which miscasting messed up in the film version.To anybody who hasn't seen this version but likes the book,please rent this film,you won't be disappointed. Also do yourself a favor and rent ""Storm of the Century"",Stephen's extremely overlooked TV masterpiece!Oh and one final thing,stay away from the awful ""Salem's Lot"" remake and stick with the original 70's version with David Soul and James Mason. Not sure why anyone felt that story needed to be remade but it didn't!Sorry, but I have one more thing to say and it has nothing at all to do with anything but Stephen if you're out there,when are you going to write an episode of the Walking Dead?????????????????????????????

Fact is, they are just different, but both are good.  The Nicholson version is Stanley Kubrick's interpretation of the story, and it deviates a great deal from the original novel.This version of ""The Shining"" hews extremely close to the original Stephen King novel, which is one of King's best.  Further, the actors here are much closer to the characterizations in the novel.  In particular, Rebecca De Mornay is superb as Wendy Torrance, and she is gorgeous to boot.  I also thought that Stephen Weber did a very good job as Jack Torrance.  While no Jack Nicholson, he actually nails the Jack Torrance character much better than Nicholson did -- his slow descent to madness is the real story of the book, and he carries it off adroitly. (Nicholson was nuts from the onset.)  Weber also does a great job of portraying a struggling alchoholic.  In this respect I thought he did a better job than Nicholson.  Courtland Mead is pretty good as young Danny Torrance.  I disagree with those reviewers who don't like the lad -- I thought he came across as pretty much a typical nine year-old.  Melvin Van Peebles is a much better Dick Halloran in this film than the chap who plays the role in the original movie version.The main flaw of this miniseries is that it is maybe a bit too long.  It does drag at times.  But mostly, it holds the viewer's interest, and is a faithful retelling of the original King novel.

724873,A2ULL5F4F3KVGZ,B000077VRT,"SharpX13 ""Jeremy""","[1, 2]","1980, Stanley Kubrick adapts Stephen King's novel &quot;The Shining&quot; and makes movie history. Although he changed it drastically, it was well recieved and remebered for it's slow and creepy pacing. Now, in 1997 we got an updated miniseries version of the same novel, this time screen-written by King himself and made for TV. The result, a different movie experience entirely. This version follows King's original story I am told to a hair. Its several hours longer providing enough time to cover every aspect of the book unlike Kubrick's version. It is strange watching the series and not seeing Nicholson as Jack but the new updated actor filled the part suprisingly well. By the third part he had truly grown into the part and was fully developed and dimensional unlike Nicholson who was just plain out crazy with no simpathy or remorse shown. The part in the miniseries when Jack tells Danny to run away from him always gives me chills. A few thigns however that brutally hurt the miniseries include the actor of Danny (who is a joke) and the poorly animated animal shrubs (it sounds stupid already.) Aside from those two flaws, the updated miniseries is an entertaining watch and should be viewed by any fan of the 1980 version. An intersting side note, writer Stephen King makes a small (and corny appearance) as an orchestra conductor and infamous writer/director Sam Raimi (Evil Dead trilogy, Spider-Man) makes a small cameo as a man who gives the cook directions to the Overlook Hotel in part 3.

724874,A1FCWRSICTO2AH,B000077VRT,S. Harris,"[3, 8]","Outside of Carrie, I feel this version of The Shining is the best adaptation of a Stephen King novel I've seen.  The defenders of the Kubrick version certainly have some ammunition, but I feel this is mostly due to Kubrick's outstanding, as always, cinematography.  The ascent up the Overlook, the many disturbing images (the ghostly parti-goers in particular), will burn right into your memory.  But undermining that effort is Kubrick's misanthropy, which runs counter, despite all his love of horror, King's belief in the goodness of at least some people, the value of love (and family, however dysfunctional) in helping to overcome evil.  Director Mick Garris captured this element perfectly, and it's reflected in the fine cast.  Stephen Weber gives us a real Jack Torrance, and not the wildly overacted version that Nicholson provided.  Rebecca de Mornay is also a more rounded Wendy Torrance than the catatonic Shelly Duvall who feebly had to beat at the air while Nicholson made funny faces.  But it's child actor Courtland Mead as Danny Torrance that pulls the movie along.  This is his movie, and it's a shame he did not receive more recognition for his performance.

724875,A1OOYXSUI4Z943,B000077VRT,"""sideshowmatthew""","[5, 7]","After the Stanley Kubric version of ""The Shining"", I doubted that the miniseries would be nearly as good. Jack Nicholson was haunting and comical in the movie, and I didn't believe Steven Weber could even compare (although I thought Weber was a good actor). But, I decided to watch anyway, since I loved the book, and I was curious to see if it would be any good. I absolutely loved this version. It is a magnificent alternative version. In my opinion, it's much better than the movie. The miniseries explores the psychological problems that Jack Torrance endures, the alcohol addiction, and the gradual descent into madness. Plus, Wendy (played excellently by Rebecca De Mornay), was a far superior character than the one in the Kubric film. Wendy in this version is loving, caring, and strong, as opposed to the cigarette-smoking one in the miniseries who is simply a doormat. Danny is also a great character, showing what the child is really thinking and going through while he sadly watches his parents struggle and argue. The hotel is beautiful, but inside, the deadly evil awaits. The bath scene was haunting, and much more realistic than the one in the film. All in all, this miniseries made much more sense than the movie, although I still love the movie anyway. I wouldn't say that Jack using a roque malet is cooler than in the movie using an axe, but it's still almost just as scary. The miniseries is true to the book. Almost all the important scenes of the book are present in this version. It is really scary. A true horror. The ending is very sad, but it's also a sensible conclusion. I definately recommend this version for horror and psychological thriller fans!

Steven Weber is excellent as Jack Torrance, the recovering alcoholic who moves with his wife and son to the Overlook Hotel in Colorado for the winter, and who soon finds himself possessed by the hotel's ghosts.  Rebecca DeMornay's performance as Wendy Torrance was much better than that of Shelley Duvall in the Kubrick version; Duvall played Wendy as a much weaker character, while DeMornay played her as the strong, fiercely protective mother that she was in the book.  Courtland Mead as Danny Torrance was simply terrific--he was far less stiff and wooden than Danny Lloyd in Kubrick's version, and he showed far more range of emotion than Lloyd did.The best surprise of this version was Melvin Van Peebles as Dick Hallorann, the Overlook's cook and the only other person who has any real understanding of ""the shining"" besides Danny himself.  I see his portrayal of Hallorann as a tribute to the late Scatman Crothers, who so ably portrayed the character in the Kubrick version, and whose death was a great loss to acting.  Melvin played Hallorann with the same charm and grace that Scatman Crothers did, but with a uniqueness that made the role all his own.The extras on the DVD were pretty good, too; I got a kick out of hearing the commentary from King, Weber, and Mick Garris, and the deleted scenes with the Garris commentary were pretty interesting as well.  I was sort of disappointed that they didn't include a ""Making Of"" featurette like they did with The Stand, but I don't see that as a reason to give this DVD a lower rating than I did.

His imagination is so crystal clear, so vivid, so intense that most of us would probably agree, the guy is simply a genius.This film version of The Shining made me realize more than any other movie I've ever watched that the medium of film is a living, breathing, collaborative form. I think Stephen King was stunned by Stanley Kubrick's original lack of reverence for his early horror masterpiece, and it festered in his mind for so many years he finally got enough money together (some 21 million dollars), hired a director *he* wanted (and had worked with on The Stand), executive produced, chose actors he liked, fought with ABC over what could and couldn't be shown on television, wrestled with censors, et cetera, et cetera. Essentially, King said to himself ""I know what I want to see in a movie version of The Shining. I know what audiences like. And I have the power to do it!""Unfortunately, the medium of film is an entity in and of itself and it works at its peak form when it is a collaborative effort and when the people involved in the collaboration aren't all genuflecting to the will of one person. That's what creates tension behind the text, so to speak. And it's what really gives movies a pulse.This version of The Shining lacks that tension. Steven Weber states very plainly in the commentary section ""I want to be superficially likable"" and goes on to say that he doesn't like to submerge himself in a character because it causes him to have panic attacks. He says he ""respects"" actors who *can* submerge themselves that way, but it is simply something he'd rather not do.The problem is Weber is the lead actor in this movie. He kind'a sets the tone for the other actors on the set. And the result is a ho-hum version of The Shining -- which, ironically is *not* what Stephen King is all about; he's anything but a ho-hum writer!I'm a young writer (see my ""about you"" area for a link to my web site) and Lord knows I have dreams about one of my novels being turned into a movie. Hell, I have dreams about them *being published* but the lesson I think I've learned from Kubrick's version, this version, and the original novel by Stephen King is that for a movie adaptation to really stand on its own, the original writer (like a parent letting a kid just be a kid) has to let the movie just be itself, for better or for worse, offering as much input as director and actors ask for, but to realize that like a kid, it has to grow up -- sometimes shaggy haired, sometimes too clean-cut, but ultimately at its best when the novelist stands back and lets the movie be just that.

As many people have said before me it is not like the movie and also having been made in the 80s the special effects are not up to par with a mini series made in the late 90s. The newer version had the bonus of having King there to keep the story true to the book and adding his abilities as the King of Horror, also the length allowed few things to be cut. I saw the TV series at 17 when it aired and couldn't wait until the next part would come on. The mini-series makes you feel like you are right there with the family and wondering if you will survive long enough for help to come.

Where a 90-minute theatrical run-time often proves confining, the extravagant length of a mini-series allows King to spread out, imparting the feel of one of his novels. Like guests at the Overlook Hotel on extended holiday, we get to stay for a while. We get to settle in. And the atmosphere...settles into us. The feel of a King novel has much to do with creating a good ""build"". King is king of the slow-burner. He takes his time. He creates a world. He ""peoples"" it. We get to know these folks, mostly through dialogue, and (in his better works) we take a shining to them, pardon the pun. And while King maintains that his process is just about telling a story, and that he's not consciously pushing themes, nevertheless, themes come out. In this one, we're treated to a haunted house story, and then...like the malevolence that inhabits The Overlook...the themes ooze out. Alcoholism. The suffering of a family. Duality. A man's need to prove and redeem himself. The cycle of violence - sins of the father, and all that. But also, in a moving way, the familial love that overcomes. It's all in there, and it makes what is on the surface level just an effective spook yarn, something more - a meditation on human relationships. Perhaps even a love story, in its own way.Kubrik vs. Garris? Whatever. I don't like comparing these films, just like I don't like pitting Batman 1966 against Nolan's Dark Knight.

It's the story of a haunted hotel wanting to possess the God-given gift of a young boy. However, that's the mere backdrop for what the book is truly about: the love of family, especially the relationship between fathers and sons, and the power of true friendship. STEPHEN KING'S THE SHINING displays all of that and most of the memorable scenes from the novel as well. Unlike the Stanley Kubrick version starring Jack Nicholson, this version stays pretty close to the material it is based upon and even includes the scenes with the hedge animals. Stephen King also has a guest appearance in the film as the conductor of the ghost band. I really didn't like Kubrick's version of THE SHINING, it strayed too far from the material it was based upon and even on it's own merits as a film and story it was so bizarre that it didn't make much sense.

724896,A20WKQ948WZOQJ,B000077VRT,Wes Saylors Jr.,"[4, 5]","Firsly, I can't stop laughing at some of these reviews concerning Courtland Mead (Danny Torrance) and his apparent inability to close his mouth.  I thought the same thing when I saw this mini-series of 'The Shining' and am glad others noticed how his barn door stayed open, as it were.  BUT ... that said, Stephen King's adaptaion of his own epic and wonderful novel 'The Shining' is a very good adaptation.  While Jack Nicholson's Jack Torrance is iconic as far as horror films go, Steven Weber and Rebecca De Mornay are almost identical to what you picture of the Torrance family when you read King's 1977 novel.  In fact, Rebecca De Mornay is exactly the character King wrote about.  Her strong and proactive character is a nice change from Shelly Duvall's pop-eyed and hysterical Wendy Torrance (though in fairness, most of this was due to Stanley Kubrick's direction).  Watching Steven Weber slowly succumb to the Overlook's demonic hold is both sad and terrifying, the way it should be.  Nicholson was terrific, but he was unbolted from the start (again, probably a Kubrick directive).  'The Shining' is originally about a descent into madness, and this mini-series allows the time for madness to slowly descend.  It is creepier when we see the commonplace and friendly give over to murderous violence.  Comparisons to Kubrick's 'The Shining' are inevitable.  And both are great.  Kubrick made a fine movie.  Stephen King and crew made a fine adaptation.  Sadly, little Courtland Mead -- open mouth notwithstanding -- is the weaker of the comparisons.  The Kubrick movie Danny Torrance is a much stronger character.  But two out of three ain't bad, and Steven Weber and Rebecca De Mornay serve up 'The Shining' in intelligent high-style.  This is a very strong movie version of a classic horror novel.",4,Danny's Going to Take Some Medicine,1234310400,"02 11, 2009",2009,1807,"['Firsly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'laughing', 'reviews', 'concerning', 'Courtland', 'Mead', 'Danny', 'Torrance', 'apparent', 'inability', 'close', 'mouth', 'thought', 'same', 'thing', 'when', 'saw', 'mini-series', ""'The"", 'Shining', 'am', 'glad', 'others', 'noticed', 'how', 'barn', 'door', 'stayed', 'open', 'were', 'BUT', 'said', 'Stephen', 'King', 'adaptaion', 'own', 'epic', 'wonderful', 'novel', 'Shining', 'very', 'good', 'adaptation', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Jack', 'Torrance', 'iconic', 'as', 'far', 'horror', 'films', 'go', 'Steven', 'Weber', 'Rebecca', 'De', 'Mornay', 'are', 'almost', 'identical', 'what', 'picture', 'Torrance', 'family', 'when', 'read', 'King', '1977', 'novel', 'fact', 'Rebecca', 'De', 'Mornay', 'exactly', 'character', 'King', 'wrote', 'about', 'strong', 'proactive', 'character', 'nice', 'change', 'Shelly', 'Duvall', 'pop-eyed', 'hysterical', 'Wendy', 'Torrance', 'fairness', 'most', 'was', 'due', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'direction', 'Watching', 'Steven', 'Weber', 'slowly', 'Overlook', 'demonic', 'hold', 'sad', 'terrifying', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'Nicholson', 'was', 'terrific', 'was', 'unbolted', 'start', 'again', 'probably', 'Kubrick', 'directive', ""'The"", 'Shining', 'originally', 'descent', 'madness', 'mini-series', 'time', 'madness', 'slowly', 'descend', 'creepier', 'when', 'see', 'commonplace', 'friendly', 'give', 'murderous', 'violence', 'Comparisons', 'Kubrick', ""'The"", 'Shining', 'are', 'inevitable', 'are', 'great', 'Kubrick', 'made', 'fine', 'movie', 'Stephen', 'King', 'crew', 'made', 'fine', 'adaptation', 'Sadly', 'little', 'Courtland', 'Mead', 'open', 'mouth', 'notwithstanding', 'weaker', 'comparisons', 'Kubrick', 'movie', 'Danny', 'Torrance', 'much', 'stronger', 'character', 'two', 'three', 'ai', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Steven', 'Weber', 'Rebecca', 'De', 'Mornay', 'serve', 'up', ""'The"", 'Shining', 'intelligent', 'high-style', 'very', 'strong', 'movie', 'version', 'classic', 'horror', 'novel']",Stephen King's The Shining
724897,A2S2QOH5JERUV7,B000077VRT,William,"[2, 3]","I read the book, but have not seen the Kubrick version in its entirety.  Still, I think this is a great adaptation of the book and perhaps a landmark in made-for-television horror.  That may not float well with some, but TV sometimes does horror better than feature films since it doesn't over rely on gore for cheap thrills.Val Lewton who produced horror films in the '40s said that a good horror movie should have a worthy drama beyond the horror elements of the story and Stephen King I think knows that.  Feature films are practically in love with cheap thrills.  They have been since the late seventies.  So it is kind of interesting that Hollywood keeps going back to King for original horror material.  I think it is because of the human drama inside of the horror story that King continually delivers.His characters are often alcoholics, writers, and vulnerable people visiting rural areas wrestling with their personal demons...and suddenly encountering very real ones.The thing I notice most about King's stories is that they grip you with a sense of true dread.  A book doesn't scare you like a movie.  A book needs that sense of sustained dread.  A movie relies on guys jumping out of the shadows more, and once you get over that then a guy simply jumps out of another shadow.So let's talk about The Shinning.  This was a three part mini-series on TV starring Steven Webber, Rebecca DeMornay, and the little boy Courtland Mead (and enough criticizing the kid's acting people.  He does a fine job).As you probably know, Jack Torrance (Weber) is a recovering alchoholic hired as caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, a huge remote vacation spot that closes in the winter.  He takes his wife and son with him thinking this job will help him rebuild his life after being fired from a teaching job.  But the deserted hotel is obviously not really deserted.  The ghosts of mob hitmen, bartenders, bitter lovers, and other dark entities are there.  When Jack's son, Danny (Mead), enters the hotel he's like a lightning rod because he has the Shinning.  He has an invisible friend named Tony who tells him the future and he can see the ghosts.  At first he is lead to believe they are like ""pictures in a book"" that cannot truly hurt him...but he finds out that his presence at the Overlook has changed that.But Jack is the weak spot that the ghosts know they can use to get Danny.  He's vulnerable.  Wendy Torrance (DeMornay, still looking as hot as she did in Risky Business) wants Jack to succeed but he's hurt her emotionally, and their son Danny physically...once, when he was drinking and he's been remorseful about it ever since.This dysfunctional family unit wins our sympathy immediately.  Something I think was a weakness of the Kubrick version (from what I've seen of it).  This is a likeable group, an attractive couple and their innocent son, facing that horrific King dread I was talking about and doing it all on their own.Perhaps the one dissapointment in this film (and it is a minor one) are the hedge animals that come to life.  I didn't find them the least bit scary.  Not nearly as scary as the ""217 lady.""  Certainly Steven Weber's performance is chilling as the ""manager"" of the Overlook gains more and more control over him.  I found the acting to be excellent across the board.  Actors in horror movies sell the scares even more than the special effects.So there we have it.  An excellent horror mini-series that I think is one of (if not the best) King adaption I've seen on TV and can hold it's own against many a feature film.  Are you waiting for me to say it's better than Kubrick's?  If I get around to seeing Kubrick's version I'll let you know, but I like this one a whole lot and I can see how it is faithful to the original story.",5,An Essential King novel adaptation,1205020800,"03 9, 2008",2008,3764,"['read', 'book', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Kubrick', 'version', 'entirety', 'Still', 'think', 'great', 'adaptation', 'book', 'perhaps', 'landmark', 'made-for-television', 'horror', 'may', 'not', 'float', 'well', 'TV', 'sometimes', 'horror', 'better', 'feature', 'films', ""n't"", 'over', 'rely', 'gore', 'cheap', 'thrills.Val', 'Lewton', 'who', 'produced', 'horror', 'films', ""'40s"", 'said', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'worthy', 'drama', 'horror', 'elements', 'story', 'Stephen', 'King', 'think', 'knows', 'Feature', 'films', 'are', 'practically', 'love', 'cheap', 'thrills', 'have', 'been', 'late', 'seventies', 'kind', 'interesting', 'Hollywood', 'going', 'back', 'King', 'original', 'horror', 'material', 'think', 'human', 'drama', 'horror', 'story', 'King', 'continually', 'characters', 'are', 'often', 'alcoholics', 'writers', 'vulnerable', 'people', 'visiting', 'rural', 'areas', 'wrestling', 'personal', 'demons', 'suddenly', 'encountering', 'very', 'real', 'thing', 'notice', 'most', 'King', 'stories', 'grip', 'sense', 'true', 'dread', 'book', ""n't"", 'scare', 'movie', 'book', 'sense', 'sustained', 'dread', 'movie', 'guys', 'jumping', 'shadows', 'more', 'once', 'get', 'then', 'guy', 'simply', 'shadow.So', 'let', 'talk', 'Shinning', 'was', 'three', 'part', 'mini-series', 'TV', 'starring', 'Steven', 'Webber', 'Rebecca', 'DeMornay', 'little', 'boy', 'Courtland', 'Mead', 'enough', 'criticizing', 'kid', 'acting', 'people', 'fine', 'job', 'probably', 'know', 'Jack', 'Torrance', 'Weber', 'recovering', 'alchoholic', 'hired', 'caretaker', 'Overlook', 'Hotel', 'huge', 'remote', 'vacation', 'spot', 'winter', 'wife', 'son', 'thinking', 'job', 'will', 'help', 'rebuild', 'life', 'being', 'fired', 'teaching', 'job', 'deserted', 'hotel', 'obviously', 'not', 'really', 'deserted', 'ghosts', 'mob', 'hitmen', 'bartenders', 'bitter', 'lovers', 'other', 'dark', 'entities', 'are', 'there', 'When', 'Jack', 'son', 'Danny', 'Mead', 'hotel', 'lightning', 'rod', 'Shinning', 'invisible', 'friend', 'named', 'Tony', 'who', 'future', 'can', 'see', 'ghosts', 'first', 'lead', 'believe', 'are', 'pictures', 'book', 'can', 'not', 'truly', 'hurt', 'out', 'presence', 'Overlook', 'changed', 'that.But', 'Jack', 'weak', 'spot', 'ghosts', 'know', 'can', 'use', 'get', 'Danny', 'vulnerable', 'Wendy', 'Torrance', 'DeMornay', 'still', 'looking', 'as', 'hot', 'did', 'Risky', 'Business', 'Jack', 'succeed', 'hurt', 'emotionally', 'son', 'Danny', 'physically', 'once', 'when', 'was', 'drinking', 'been', 'remorseful', 'ever', 'since.This', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'unit', 'sympathy', 'immediately', 'Something', 'think', 'was', 'weakness', 'Kubrick', 'version', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'likeable', 'group', 'attractive', 'couple', 'innocent', 'son', 'facing', 'horrific', 'King', 'dread', 'was', 'talking', 'doing', 'own.Perhaps', 'one', 'dissapointment', 'film', 'minor', 'one', 'are', 'hedge', 'animals', 'come', 'life', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'least', 'bit', 'scary', 'Not', 'nearly', 'as', 'scary', '217', 'lady', 'Certainly', 'Steven', 'Weber', 'performance', 'chilling', 'manager', 'Overlook', 'gains', 'more', 'more', 'control', 'found', 'acting', 'be', 'excellent', 'board', 'Actors', 'horror', 'movies', 'sell', 'scares', 'even', 'more', 'special', 'effects.So', 'have', 'excellent', 'horror', 'mini-series', 'think', 'one', 'not', 'best', 'King', 'adaption', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'TV', 'can', 'hold', 'own', 'many', 'feature', 'film', 'Are', 'waiting', 'say', 'better', 'Kubrick', 'get', 'around', 'seeing', 'Kubrick', 'version', ""'ll"", 'let', 'know', 'like', 'one', 'whole', 'lot', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'faithful', 'original', 'story']",Stephen King's The Shining
