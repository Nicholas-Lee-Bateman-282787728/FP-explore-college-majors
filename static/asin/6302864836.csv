341608,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,6302864836,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[3, 3]","Continuing my streak of reviewing old animated films I have not seen in years (Some I hadn't seen in more than a decade), I found this film and decided to watch it again along with all the others I had picked out. Sadly, this film didn't hold up quite as well as I hoped it would. Don't get me wrong, it's still good, but it's a bit lacking unfortunately.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: When the meadow of Dapplewood is contaminated by a poisonous gas, three friends: Abigail, Edgar, and Russel are sent to retrieve herbs to help their friend Michelle who has been poisoned by the gas and must be back in two days, or she will die. So the trio is taken on a dangerous, yet fun adventure.MUSIC: This music is really good and is easily one of the greatest parts of this film. The only problem with this film's music are the singing parts, which are awful (Thank God there's only two singing scenes). I have no complaints toward the composer, though.ACTING: The voice-actors themselves aren't bad, but the dialogue is at times. This is one of the things that drags this film down is because of the moments of laughable dialogue. For the most part this area works, but it could have been done so much better.ACTION: Watching these characters wander around is surprisingly interesting because of their many encounters with machinery and humans. There's even a small part of the film in which they build a flying machine which actually looks cool and the brief flying scenes are fun to watch. This area is pretty good and never really gets boring.OVERALL: This film's quality is dragged down by the forgettable storyline filled with convoluted environmental messages, bad singing scenes, and laughable dialogue. But, the film manages to save itself and remains consistently entertaining because of the action scenes and wonderful music. I recommend you rent this first, however.THE GOOD: Cool action scenes, great music, and good-looking animation.THE BAD: Bad musical scenes, laughable dialogue, underwhelming storyline.",3,A DECENT CHILDREN'S FILM  7 OUT OF 10,1260662400,"12 13, 2009",2009,2000,"['Continuing', 'streak', 'reviewing', 'old', 'animated', 'films', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'years', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'more', 'decade', 'found', 'film', 'decided', 'watch', 'again', 'others', 'had', 'picked', 'out', 'Sadly', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'quite', 'as', 'well', 'hoped', 'would', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'still', 'good', 'bit', 'lacking', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'When', 'meadow', 'Dapplewood', 'contaminated', 'poisonous', 'gas', 'three', 'friends', 'Abigail', 'Edgar', 'Russel', 'are', 'sent', 'retrieve', 'herbs', 'help', 'friend', 'Michelle', 'who', 'been', 'poisoned', 'gas', 'must', 'be', 'back', 'two', 'days', 'will', 'die', 'trio', 'taken', 'dangerous', 'yet', 'fun', 'adventure.MUSIC', 'music', 'really', 'good', 'easily', 'one', 'greatest', 'parts', 'film', 'only', 'problem', 'film', 'music', 'are', 'singing', 'parts', 'are', 'awful', 'Thank', 'God', 'only', 'two', 'singing', 'scenes', 'have', 'complaints', 'composer', 'though.ACTING', 'voice-actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'dialogue', 'times', 'one', 'things', 'drags', 'film', 'down', 'moments', 'laughable', 'dialogue', 'most', 'part', 'area', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'so', 'much', 'better.ACTION', 'Watching', 'characters', 'wander', 'around', 'surprisingly', 'interesting', 'many', 'encounters', 'machinery', 'humans', 'even', 'small', 'part', 'film', 'build', 'flying', 'machine', 'actually', 'cool', 'brief', 'flying', 'scenes', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'area', 'pretty', 'good', 'never', 'really', 'boring.OVERALL', 'film', 'quality', 'dragged', 'down', 'forgettable', 'storyline', 'filled', 'convoluted', 'environmental', 'messages', 'bad', 'singing', 'scenes', 'laughable', 'dialogue', 'film', 'save', 'consistently', 'entertaining', 'action', 'scenes', 'wonderful', 'music', 'recommend', 'rent', 'first', 'however.THE', 'GOOD', 'Cool', 'action', 'scenes', 'great', 'music', 'good-looking', 'animation.THE', 'BAD', 'Bad', 'musical', 'scenes', 'laughable', 'dialogue', 'underwhelming', 'storyline']",N/A

Three little furlings, Abigail, a mouse, Edgar, a mole. and Russell a  hedgehog are students of Cornelius the Badger, an uncle to young Michelle, and most generally they cause a mess although they don't mean to. On their outing, disaster strikes and Michelle is struck down ill by a deadly gas that is wreaking havoc throughout all of Dapplewood. It is up to the three to help save Michelle's life by going on a quest to another meadow to find herbs to heal her. Armed with a map and some food they set off into a land filled with dangers. Along the way, they escape an Owl, and save a young bird from swamp mud, to learn that the path to what they seek leads through the &#34;Land of the Yellow Dragons&#34;. They then discover the herbs are there, but time is short and they must get back as quickly as they can. Thankfully, they have a way, thanks to Cornelius and his blueprints for his latest invention. When they return, Dapplewood seems under invasion as humans appear and when Edgar gets trapped, Cornelius gets a surprise of his own about humans.

The movie starts off showing the animals getting ready for the days lesson and arriving at school at Cornelius's house in Dapplewood.Cornelius proceeds to show the class his life's work, the Flapper wind thing. It is a model that flies around the house and breaks. He plans on someday making the real thing and they set out for the days journey.While walking around in the forest to get to the surprise one of the animals finds a street and runs back into the forest at the same time a vehicle is going by tossing a glass out the window.The animals want to know what that was, Cornelius tells them to get out of the road, and they go to the water to ride in the canoe. They take turns rowing and getting all wet. Upon getting out of the water Cornelius notices the quietness of the forest and they hurry home.What happened was another vehicle hit the glass in the road causing it to turn over and emit some gas fumes into the forest. The animals make it to Michelle's house and smell the fumes. Michelle enters to find her mommy and daddy while the others wait on Cornelius to think of what to do next. Abigail goes in to pull out Michelle, whose parents did die.They go to higher ground, which is at Cornelius's house. There Cornelius, who is Michelle's uncle, places Michelle in bed and tells a story of when he was a child and the same thing happened to his parents and he was the only one who got out.This is a great family movie that shows the animals getting along for the sole purpose of helping another. It shows their instincts in taking care of themselves while on their journey.Children will see life through the eyes of animals and how leaving glass on the street can cause a flat tire and damage to the animals in the woods. The three classmates grew up in the two days that they searched for the meadow and made their teacher proud.What more could you want for a child to see than a life lesson while watching animals, listening to music and the colorful scenery.",4,Beware the yellow dragons!,1099612800,"11 5, 2004",2004,2108,"['Once', 'A', 'Forest', 'mole', 'badger', 'hedgehog', 'who', 'go', 'Ferling', 'class', 'taught', 'Cornelius', 'played', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'movie', 'showing', 'animals', 'getting', 'ready', 'days', 'lesson', 'arriving', 'school', 'Cornelius', 'house', 'Dapplewood.Cornelius', 'proceeds', 'show', 'class', 'life', 'work', 'Flapper', 'wind', 'thing', 'model', 'house', 'breaks', 'someday', 'making', 'real', 'thing', 'set', 'out', 'days', 'journey.While', 'walking', 'around', 'forest', 'get', 'surprise', 'one', 'animals', 'street', 'back', 'forest', 'same', 'time', 'vehicle', 'going', 'tossing', 'glass', 'window.The', 'animals', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'Cornelius', 'get', 'road', 'go', 'water', 'ride', 'canoe', 'take', 'turns', 'rowing', 'getting', 'wet', 'getting', 'water', 'Cornelius', 'quietness', 'forest', 'hurry', 'happened', 'was', 'vehicle', 'hit', 'glass', 'road', 'causing', 'turn', 'over', 'emit', 'gas', 'fumes', 'forest', 'animals', 'make', 'Michelle', 'house', 'smell', 'fumes', 'Michelle', 'enters', 'find', 'mommy', 'daddy', 'others', 'wait', 'Cornelius', 'think', 'what', 'do', 'next', 'Abigail', 'pull', 'out', 'Michelle', 'parents', 'did', 'die.They', 'go', 'higher', 'ground', 'Cornelius', 'house', 'Cornelius', 'who', 'Michelle', 'uncle', 'places', 'Michelle', 'bed', 'story', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'same', 'thing', 'happened', 'parents', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'got', 'great', 'family', 'movie', 'animals', 'getting', 'along', 'sole', 'purpose', 'helping', 'instincts', 'taking', 'care', 'journey.Children', 'will', 'see', 'life', 'eyes', 'animals', 'how', 'leaving', 'glass', 'street', 'can', 'cause', 'flat', 'tire', 'damage', 'animals', 'woods', 'three', 'classmates', 'grew', 'up', 'two', 'days', 'searched', 'meadow', 'made', 'teacher', 'more', 'could', 'want', 'child', 'see', 'life', 'lesson', 'watching', 'animals', 'listening', 'music', 'colorful', 'scenery']",N/A

341637,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,6302864836,Z Hayes,"[3, 3]","I watched this with my 4.5 year-old the other day and I'm glad I did because though this is a great kids' movie with important themes, it also contains some scary parts that may cause sensitive younger children to cry or even have nightmares.The story centers around some young furlings, woodland creatures, i.e. a hedgehog names Russel, a mole named Edgar, a mouse named Abigail, and a badger named Michelle. They all attend classes conducted by a wise older badger named Cornelius. One day, a terrible tragedy befalls the forest when a tanker carrying toxic chemicals has an accident near the forest and the toxic fumes permeate the forest, causing casualties amongst the woodland creatures, including Michelle. This is the part that is quite scary [SPOILERS]- Michelle and her friends accompanied by Cornelius return from a field trip to find the forest strangely quiet and deserted - Michelle runs into her home only to find her parents dead, and falls victim to the toxic fumes, going into a coma.It is left to Michelle's friends to help find some herbs that will save her, whilst Cornelius remains behind to watch over Michelle. The animation is enchanting, bringing the forest to vivid life with bold colors. The characters are all endearing. There are some important themes explored here - the threat posed by Man to the environment, the loss of animals' habitat, but the most important message that shines through is the enduring power of friendship, teamwork and perseverance. Abigail, Edgar and Russell work together and coax each other on to help get the herbs necessary to save Michelle's life.My preschooler loved this movie, though she did cry at the part where Michelle gets hurt, but all in all, if an adult sits with a younger child through those scary parts, this does have many positives to recommend it as a wonderful kids' movie.",4,"Great story, but younger kids' need an adult to watch it with them",1244937600,"06 14, 2009",2009,1851,"['watched', '4.5', 'year-old', 'other', 'day', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'because', 'great', 'kids', 'movie', 'important', 'themes', 'also', 'scary', 'parts', 'may', 'cause', 'sensitive', 'younger', 'children', 'cry', 'even', 'have', 'nightmares.The', 'story', 'centers', 'young', 'furlings', 'woodland', 'creatures', 'i.e', 'hedgehog', 'names', 'Russel', 'mole', 'named', 'Edgar', 'mouse', 'named', 'Abigail', 'badger', 'named', 'Michelle', 'attend', 'classes', 'conducted', 'wise', 'older', 'badger', 'named', 'Cornelius', 'One', 'day', 'terrible', 'tragedy', 'forest', 'when', 'tanker', 'carrying', 'toxic', 'chemicals', 'accident', 'forest', 'toxic', 'fumes', 'permeate', 'forest', 'causing', 'casualties', 'amongst', 'woodland', 'creatures', 'including', 'Michelle', 'part', 'quite', 'scary', '[', 'SPOILERS', ']', 'Michelle', 'friends', 'accompanied', 'Cornelius', 'return', 'field', 'trip', 'find', 'forest', 'strangely', 'quiet', 'deserted', 'Michelle', 'home', 'only', 'find', 'parents', 'dead', 'victim', 'toxic', 'fumes', 'going', 'coma.It', 'left', 'Michelle', 'friends', 'help', 'find', 'herbs', 'will', 'save', 'whilst', 'Cornelius', 'watch', 'Michelle', 'animation', 'enchanting', 'bringing', 'forest', 'vivid', 'life', 'bold', 'colors', 'characters', 'are', 'endearing', 'are', 'important', 'themes', 'explored', 'here', 'threat', 'posed', 'Man', 'environment', 'loss', 'animals', 'habitat', 'most', 'important', 'message', 'enduring', 'power', 'friendship', 'teamwork', 'perseverance', 'Abigail', 'Edgar', 'Russell', 'work', 'together', 'coax', 'other', 'help', 'get', 'herbs', 'necessary', 'save', 'Michelle', 'life.My', 'preschooler', 'loved', 'movie', 'did', 'cry', 'part', 'where', 'Michelle', 'hurt', 'adult', 'younger', 'child', 'scary', 'parts', 'have', 'many', 'positives', 'recommend', 'wonderful', 'kids', 'movie']",N/A
