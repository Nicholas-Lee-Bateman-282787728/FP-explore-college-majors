There are some moves where you go forward, backward, or diagonally. If you don't have the room, you can modify it to do it in place, or just side to side. The intensity is intermediate to advanced, about at the level of Cathe Friedrich. You will work up quite a sweat, but it's definitely doable. There are several premixes different in length and a couple of them have weight segments from All Pump Extreme mixed with the cardio segments from this workout which gives you lots of variety.",5,Good Workout,1212364800,"06 2, 2008",2008,595,"['nothing', 'wrong', 'workout', 'experienced', 'video', 'exerciser', 'easy', 'enough', 'follow', 'are', 'moves', 'where', 'go', 'forward', 'backward', 'diagonally', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'room', 'can', 'modify', 'do', 'place', 'just', 'side', 'side', 'intensity', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'about', 'level', 'Cathe', 'Friedrich', 'will', 'work', 'up', 'quite', 'sweat', 'definitely', 'doable', 'are', 'several', 'premixes', 'different', 'length', 'couple', 'have', 'weight', 'segments', 'All', 'Pump', 'Extreme', 'mixed', 'cardio', 'segments', 'workout', 'lots', 'variety']",Amy Bento: Hi-Lo Xtreme Workout

I'm going to say a word and you say/do whatever first pops into your brain  (hint: it's an exercise term).PONYDid you A) Mentally execute the move or B) Feel some stirring grey matter and after five seconds said, ""Oh, I know what that is.""If you mentally executed the move with form this is probably a program you will enjoy.If you fall into group B, you would likely be fine with this DVD if you don't mind previewing it several times before expecting to perform very well, and if you don't mind high impact, fast paced choreography.  If you are person who allows not being able to catch right on to a new program to discourage you or can't keep up with an intense workout right now, come back to this DVD later.This program lasts longer than most low impact videos.  I think it is very well done with a great progression of moves.  I was so happy to find a cardio workout that was actually a challenge after having came up through the ranks.  If you've found yourself not able to really push yourself with your current workout collection - you will find a great addition here.Note:  You do not need an airplane hanger for this workout.  I exercise in a 15 by 15 foot room with furniture around the perimeter that reduces it to approximately 8 by 10 feet.  The only modifications I had to make were for ""Football Feet"" and ""Around the Ring"" and for these the only difference is I would make two 'loops' to the instructor's one.",5,"Not for the weak of heart, but kicks butt for everyone else!",1226016000,"11 7, 2008",2008,1491,"['Here', 'quick', 'test', 'find', 'out', 'are', 'read', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'going', 'say', 'word', 'say/do', 'first', 'brain', 'hint', 'exercise', 'term', 'Mentally', 'execute', 'move', 'B', 'Feel', 'stirring', 'grey', 'matter', 'five', 'seconds', 'said', 'Oh', 'know', 'what', 'mentally', 'executed', 'move', 'form', 'probably', 'program', 'will', 'enjoy.If', 'fall', 'group', 'B', 'would', 'likely', 'be', 'fine', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'previewing', 'several', 'times', 'expecting', 'perform', 'very', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'high', 'impact', 'fast', 'paced', 'choreography', 'are', 'person', 'who', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'catch', 'right', 'new', 'program', 'discourage', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'intense', 'workout', 'right', 'now', 'come', 'back', 'DVD', 'later.This', 'program', 'longer', 'most', 'low', 'impact', 'videos', 'think', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'great', 'progression', 'moves', 'was', 'so', 'happy', 'find', 'cardio', 'workout', 'was', 'actually', 'challenge', 'having', 'came', 'up', 'ranks', ""'ve"", 'found', 'not', 'able', 'really', 'push', 'current', 'workout', 'collection', 'will', 'find', 'great', 'addition', 'here.Note', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'airplane', 'hanger', 'workout', 'exercise', '15', '15', 'foot', 'room', 'furniture', 'perimeter', 'approximately', '8', '10', 'feet', 'only', 'modifications', 'had', 'make', 'were', 'Football', 'Feet', 'Ring', 'only', 'difference', 'would', 'make', 'two', ""'loops"", 'instructor', 'one']",Amy Bento: Hi-Lo Xtreme Workout
1136241,A182BI64KXLZMB,B0012909R2,Janny B.,"[0, 0]","Amy Bento is my favorite workout instructor.  I bought all of her DVD's available for sale at Collage Video (except for step videos, as I don't have one).  I came to Amazon to check for any of her tapes I didn't have, and found this Hi/Lo Extreme.  I read the mixed reviews, went ahead and ordered it, and am very glad I did.  I agree with the reviewers who criticized her lack of advance cuing.  However, as someone who knows Amy's moves, and with the amount of repitition in the tape, it wasn't a big issue.  It was interesting to do this 2007 DVD, having seen the strength of her more recent workouts.  The music was definitely dated; her latest DVD's have terrific music.  In her later workouts, she also has more variety of movement.  This being said, it is a kickass workout!  As with all her tapes, she gave combinations followed by intense intervals.  My favorite combo is #3, and favorite interval was #2's ""football drill"" one.  It was really a super fast, dancy grapevine, and great fun.  It's a one hour long, high intensity cardio workout.  If that's what you're looking for, this is it.",4,Another Great Amy Workout,1269043200,"03 20, 2010",2010,1100,"['Amy', 'Bento', 'favorite', 'workout', 'instructor', 'bought', 'DVD', 'available', 'sale', 'Collage', 'Video', 'step', 'videos', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'came', 'Amazon', 'check', 'tapes', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'found', 'Hi/Lo', 'Extreme', 'read', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'went', 'ahead', 'ordered', 'am', 'very', 'glad', 'did', 'agree', 'reviewers', 'who', 'criticized', 'lack', 'advance', 'cuing', 'However', 'someone', 'who', 'Amy', 'moves', 'amount', 'repitition', 'tape', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'issue', 'was', 'interesting', 'do', '2007', 'DVD', 'having', 'seen', 'strength', 'more', 'recent', 'workouts', 'music', 'was', 'definitely', 'dated', 'latest', 'DVD', 'have', 'terrific', 'music', 'later', 'workouts', 'also', 'more', 'variety', 'movement', 'being', 'said', 'kickass', 'workout', 'tapes', 'gave', 'combinations', 'followed', 'intense', 'intervals', 'favorite', 'combo', '3', 'favorite', 'interval', 'was', '2', 'football', 'drill', 'one', 'was', 'really', 'super', 'fast', 'dancy', 'grapevine', 'great', 'fun', 'one', 'hour', 'long', 'high', 'intensity', 'cardio', 'workout', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking']",Amy Bento: Hi-Lo Xtreme Workout
