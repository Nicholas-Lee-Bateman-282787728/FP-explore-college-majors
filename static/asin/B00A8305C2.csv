Characters are interesting and fun the watch as they work their way through the series. There are a few suggestive situation that might cause some people some problems but overall a very good collection.,4,Not Too Bad.....,1378857600,"09 11, 2013",2013,306,"['nice', 'collection', 'enjoyed', 'idea', 'women', 'world', 'how', 'type', 'set', 'up', 'would', 'play', 'out', 'Characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'watch', 'work', 'way', 'series', 'are', 'few', 'suggestive', 'situation', 'might', 'cause', 'people', 'problems', 'very', 'good', 'collection']",N/A

1606744,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B00A8305C2,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[21, 27]","Hideyoshi is a lazy middle school girl. One day she is taken away to a parallel universe inhabited only by women. She meets a warrior named Oda Nobunaga. Nobunaga is after the pieces of a legendary set of armor. It is said that whoever obtains the armor will conquer the world. Hideyoshi gets involved with Nobunaga and tags along with her on the quest to unite the country.This anime was a big disappointment for me. The first thing that bothered me was the main character. She is dumb, annoying, and whiny. Brittney Karbowski voices her, and she's very hard to listen to. Normally, Brittney Karbowski does a good job most of the time, but her character in this is whiny, shrill, and barley tolerable. She's a far cry from Icaros in Heaven's Lost Property or Ayu from Kanon.The story is pretty mush a waste. Nothing really happens in this series. There are a few decent fights, but most of this anime is just fluff. The battle at the end, that was supposed to be the climax, is a major let down. Most of the voice actors, the animation, and the soundtrack are all pretty good. That's all it has going for it. Good production quality. It's a shame that Sentai sees fit to dub half baked shows like this and produce excellent shows without dubbing them. If you're looking for fan service and yuri, this anime has it. If you want good characters and a interesting story, look somewhere else. I can't recommend this anime to anyone. It simply a waste of time.",2,"Fluff, Nothing More Than Good Visuals",1362355200,"03 4, 2013",2013,1456,"['Hideyoshi', 'lazy', 'middle', 'school', 'girl', 'One', 'day', 'taken', 'away', 'parallel', 'universe', 'inhabited', 'only', 'women', 'warrior', 'named', 'Oda', 'Nobunaga', 'Nobunaga', 'pieces', 'legendary', 'set', 'armor', 'said', 'whoever', 'armor', 'will', 'conquer', 'world', 'Hideyoshi', 'involved', 'Nobunaga', 'tags', 'quest', 'unite', 'country.This', 'anime', 'was', 'big', 'disappointment', 'first', 'thing', 'bothered', 'was', 'main', 'character', 'dumb', 'annoying', 'whiny', 'Brittney', 'Karbowski', 'very', 'hard', 'listen', 'Normally', 'Brittney', 'Karbowski', 'good', 'job', 'most', 'time', 'character', 'whiny', 'shrill', 'barley', 'tolerable', 'far', 'cry', 'Icaros', 'Heaven', 'Lost', 'Property', 'Ayu', 'Kanon.The', 'story', 'pretty', 'mush', 'waste', 'Nothing', 'really', 'series', 'are', 'few', 'decent', 'fights', 'most', 'anime', 'just', 'fluff', 'battle', 'end', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'climax', 'major', 'let', 'down', 'Most', 'voice', 'actors', 'animation', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'going', 'Good', 'production', 'quality', 'shame', 'Sentai', 'fit', 'dub', 'half', 'baked', 'shows', 'produce', 'excellent', 'shows', 'dubbing', ""'re"", 'looking', 'fan', 'service', 'yuri', 'anime', 'want', 'good', 'characters', 'interesting', 'story', 'look', 'somewhere', 'else', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anime', 'anyone', 'simply', 'waste', 'time']",N/A
1606745,A5NBN8UGSH9LW,B00A8305C2,Math Dude,"[6, 10]","To be blunt, this is an analogue of Sengoku Basara with a female cast.  It takes place during the same time period and has the same basic cast of characters; it also has a noticeable lack of good voice acting.  To be fair, though, I have heard/seen much worse.  Brittney Karbowski put the same energy into this role as she did Black Star and Yamada (though her performance here lacks any sort of memorable quality thanks to the part itself).  The bottom line is that this is very middle-of-the-road and can be missed on the first few passes unless you really need to kill time.",3,Not The Best.

The series is a nice mix of Samurai Girl and Sengoku Basara as the characters we see or read about have their gender changed in this series meaning Data Masamune is a female in this series.  The overall plot is pretty standard by now in most anime series for the past ten years or so but still if you can overlook this it's actually very entertaining.
