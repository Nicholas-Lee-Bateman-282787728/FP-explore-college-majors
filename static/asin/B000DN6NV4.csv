Where is So Ji-Sub's management team here?Anyway, on the surface this is a typical K-drama, with a lot of melodrama, coincidences, and love triangles, but just beneath that layer is a truly wonderfully visionary drama about loneliness, mortality, love, love gained and love lost. This series made So Ji-Sub (the lead male character) a superstar, and while how he was overlooked in his other dramas is beyond me (his eyes are AMAZINGLY expressive), this role could not have been pulled off by anyone other than him. His performance is spot-on and he makes the ending so heartrending, I will amazed if the most hardened k-drama-watchers do not sob.BUY this K-Drama!!!! It's worth every penny.",4,A great drama + hunkalicious SO JI-SUB is in it,1195084800,"11 15, 2007",2007,820,"['Oh', 'man', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'series', 'not', 'been', 'officially', 'released', 'box', 'set', 'not', 'licensed', 'U.S..', 'Where', 'So', 'Ji-Sub', 'management', 'team', 'here', 'Anyway', 'surface', 'typical', 'K-drama', 'lot', 'melodrama', 'coincidences', 'love', 'triangles', 'just', 'beneath', 'layer', 'truly', 'wonderfully', 'visionary', 'drama', 'loneliness', 'mortality', 'love', 'love', 'gained', 'love', 'lost', 'series', 'made', 'So', 'Ji-Sub', 'lead', 'male', 'character', 'superstar', 'how', 'was', 'overlooked', 'other', 'dramas', 'eyes', 'are', 'AMAZINGLY', 'expressive', 'role', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'pulled', 'off', 'anyone', 'other', 'performance', 'spot-on', 'ending', 'so', 'heartrending', 'will', 'amazed', 'most', 'hardened', 'k-drama-watchers', 'do', 'not', 'sob.BUY', 'K-Drama', 'worth', 'penny']",N/A

HER CLOTHES ARE  ALWAYS BAGGY, AT LEAST 2 SIZES TOO BIG. IT WOULD BE OK IF SHE PLAYS THE LITTLE SISTER BUT NOT  IN SUCH A SERIOUS ROLE OPPOSITE THE MALE ACTOR WHO IS A LOT MORE MATURE AND COULD REALLY ACT.  NOW SHE COULD CRY ON A MOMENT NOTICE OTHERWISE  SHE COULDNT ACT.  THE STORY LINE IS OK  BUT THAN IT GETS UNCONVINCING AND UNREAL AS IT GOES.

That was when I was on disc 2 and getting bored with it, but, geez, did it improve!!!I did watch through to the end and must admit, this is probably the best Korean drama I've ever seen, although incredibly sad.

963257,AOHQAJRWKEDY6,B000DN6NV4,"Ukegirl ""Jill, OldTime Film Fan""","[1, 1]","I'm Sorry, I Love You (2004) was a huge 16 episode television hit series made by Koreans, but popular all throughout the Asian world. Slightly soap-opera-ish in nature, it is an extremely addictive show because it develops its plotlines slowly and you really begin to care about the characters. The leads are all very attractive people and their acting is realistic and emotional. The music is beautiful and the production values are excellent. It was filmed in Australia and Korea.It's the story of a petty gangster - street hustler growing up homeless in Australia, who is shot in the head at the wedding of a woman he loved. The doctors cannot remove the bullet and they give him a few months to live. The woman he loved gives him money and tells him to return to his homeland of Korea. He goes and makes a search for his birth mother whom he believes gave him up for adoption because of financial hardship, finds her, is shocked to discover she is rich, has another son, and so he doesn't reveal to her his identity but instead plans his revenge. Along the way he falls in love with a gentle girl who works for his step-brother, and he begins a mellowing process. Will he cling to bitterness until the end of his life, or will he find the grace to forgive those he believed wronged him?Many surprises are in store for the viewer during this series. There is also some humor to relieve the dramatic tension. I really loved this show and everyone I have recommended it to has become as hooked as I was!I recommend that you download the video files from Amazon Video On Demand, instead of buying the OOP boxset. The Amazon Video files are encrypted however, so you will only be able to view them on your computer. However it is worth it because the white subtitles are infinitely easier to read. The yellow subtitles in the boxset are terrible in comparison, plus the boxset puts 16 episodes crammed onto only 2 DVDs, so the resolution on them is poor due to too much compression. A better boxset is available in Korea that has 7 DVDs, but you're not going to find that selling here on Amazon because it is Region 3.",5,The Reformation of a petty Gangster,1261267200,"12 20, 2009",2009,2117,"[""'m"", 'Sorry', 'Love', '2004', 'was', 'huge', '16', 'episode', 'television', 'hit', 'series', 'made', 'Koreans', 'popular', 'Asian', 'world', 'Slightly', 'soap-opera-ish', 'nature', 'extremely', 'addictive', 'show', 'plotlines', 'slowly', 'really', 'begin', 'care', 'characters', 'leads', 'are', 'very', 'attractive', 'people', 'acting', 'realistic', 'emotional', 'music', 'beautiful', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'excellent', 'was', 'filmed', 'Australia', 'Korea.It', 'story', 'petty', 'gangster', 'street', 'hustler', 'growing', 'up', 'homeless', 'Australia', 'who', 'shot', 'head', 'wedding', 'woman', 'loved', 'doctors', 'can', 'not', 'remove', 'bullet', 'give', 'few', 'months', 'live', 'woman', 'loved', 'money', 'return', 'homeland', 'Korea', 'search', 'birth', 'mother', 'whom', 'gave', 'up', 'adoption', 'financial', 'hardship', 'shocked', 'discover', 'rich', 'son', 'so', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'identity', 'instead', 'revenge', 'way', 'love', 'gentle', 'girl', 'who', 'step-brother', 'mellowing', 'process', 'Will', 'cling', 'bitterness', 'end', 'life', 'will', 'find', 'grace', 'forgive', 'believed', 'wronged', 'Many', 'surprises', 'are', 'store', 'viewer', 'series', 'also', 'humor', 'relieve', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'really', 'loved', 'show', 'everyone', 'have', 'recommended', 'become', 'as', 'hooked', 'was', 'recommend', 'download', 'video', 'files', 'Amazon', 'Video', 'Demand', 'instead', 'buying', 'OOP', 'boxset', 'Amazon', 'Video', 'files', 'are', 'encrypted', 'however', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'able', 'view', 'computer', 'However', 'white', 'subtitles', 'are', 'infinitely', 'easier', 'read', 'yellow', 'subtitles', 'boxset', 'are', 'terrible', 'comparison', 'boxset', '16', 'episodes', 'crammed', 'only', '2', 'DVDs', 'resolution', 'poor', 'due', 'too', 'much', 'compression', 'better', 'boxset', 'available', 'Korea', '7', 'DVDs', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'find', 'selling', 'here', 'Amazon', 'Region', '3']",N/A
