This movie, from what I believe, takes place between Pokemon 3 and Pokemon 4ever.  I liked Mewtwo Returns.  I thought it was repetitive at times and I miss the CGI from the 'official' movies.  However, I thought it was nice to see the return of Mewtwo.  I especially like the DVD feature for the uncut story of Mewtwo's origin.  I thought that was exciting.

I remember it advertised on TV when I use to watch Pokemon on Kids WB!Last Time:Mewtwo is a clone Pokemon, an improved version of the legendary Mew, created for Team Rocket boss Giovanni. He teaches Mewtwo how to use and properly focus his psychic powers. But when he finds out Giovanni wants him to basically do his biding, he explodes the building he is in, and builds a new lab on some island. Random Pokemon trainers are selected to fight against ""the worlds greatest Pokemon master"", and Ash is one of the chosen. It was a huge battle of clone Pokemon and real Pokemon, while Mewtwo's storm begins to destroy the Earth. Ash tries to stop the battle, and when he takes a direct hit from Mew and Mewtwo, he turns to stone, and the tears of the Pokemon restore him. This makes Mewtwo realize something, and he takes the clone Pokemon, and wipes the memories of the trainers who were there.Now:Mewtwo has finally found a home for the clones. A beautiful place in Purity Canyon, where the water is extremely clean and pure. And they are safe here. Or, they were. But Giovanni has pin-pointed his location, and brings in the entire Team Rocket force to the scene, to capture him and the other clones. Ash, Misty, Brock, two researches, and Team Rocket's Jessie and James (and Meowth) get mixed up in all this. They, of course, do not remember the clones, but they remember them. There's is then a great battle. What will happen next? Watch, to find out and see!I loved this movie. It's really good. If you liked the first movie, you'll sure love this one.

The story goes like this:At the start of the movie, it displays Pok&eacute;mon: The First Movie in letterbox mode. Following that, Giovanni's first objective is to bring back Mewtwo by using the 2 robots to create a force field, where Mewtwo cannot escape. One is red, the other is blue.When the main title screen appears, then fades away, our heroes finally reach Mount Kana, the Johto region where Mewtwo lives. Once it started to rain, Brock pulls out the frying pan to cover his head while the heroes try to reach the bus. Will they ever reach the bus?After tripping over, Luna says that it's too dangerous to go up Mount Kana in such severe weather. Suddenly, the bus begins to spin off the ground, because Mewtwo doesn't want to be seen by Giovanni, the deadliest opponent in the Pok&eacute;mon universe. Meanwhile, Luna told our heroes to go inside to discover the dangers of Mount Kana, when suddenly, Team Rocket jumps into the scene to steal Pikachu using the electronic rod, so Pikachu can't shock them. How ridiculous! But, the Meowth balloon contains 1 rocket on each side of the Meowth balloon. As soon as they blast off, the balloon was about to lose control, so Ash Ketchum lost Pikachu. They had to get the ropes to climb up Mount Kana, but Luna knows the way.Next, the balloon begins to crash into our heroes. As soon as they got on the balloon, Domino reveals her true identity. It was 009. Then, Domino began to fall off the balloon, pull out the black rose, and throw it toward the balloon for some hilarious havoc! Ahh!Later in the movie, Team Rocket was sent to jail, so when Meowth was going away, Team Rocket calls him a traitor. Then, the 2 clones of Pikachu want to battle, but Mewtwo thinks that battling is senseless. However, every time the cloned Meowth tries to say something, he makes me laugh all the time.Suddenly, the Team Rocket balloons are about to take away Mewtwo, so Ash and the gang have to transform the log into a canoe by using Bulbasaur and Chikorita to do the work. As they head toward Mount Kana, they encounter the Team Rocket balloons, hoping not to be seen. Once they got there, the scientist who discovers water thinks that water is essential to life.As our heroes head back down, they were encountered by Team Rocket, so Team Rocket sends both our heroes and Mewtwo's clones to prison. Suddenly, a Butterfree swarm is approaching, so the Pok&eacute;mon clones were saying that a whole flock of Butterfree are coming, even if our heroes can't understand Pok&eacute;mon language. Once the Butterfree unleash their Sleep Powder attack, one of the Team Rocket grunts was holding the torch, so when the torch began to fall to the ground, a massive explosion occurs and the prison door has opened up.Once our heroes are going back down Mount Kana, they encounter Giovanni, who is ready to take Mewtwo away. He thinks that Psychic powers can compete with humans, but not machines. As soon as Mewtwo got into the force field, Mewtwo is about to die! Can Ash and the gang rescue Mewtwo from the evil clutches of Giovanni? You'll have to watch the movie to find out.The Pikachu balloon part of this movie is great, and the dialogue is uncut (Ages 6+).Also note that there is no such thing as Pok&eacute;mon 4: The Movie, Celebi: A Timeless Encounter. And as the Pok&eacute;mon phenomenon goes down in flames, the legend will never die!Wait!  Something's happening!

I like this movie because it han a very interesting story line continuing from the previous movie. Mewtwo from the first movie is so cruel, mean and has no sympathetic feeling. But, in this movie, his inner feelings is very appealing. The whole story was about Mewtwo's dilemma regarding on his and his cloned pokemon origin and where they should belong. The part where he willing to rescue humans(in the bus) really touched me cause he was totally different from the previous movie. His act of struggling to protect his own cloned pokemon from Team Rocket's boss really touched me. The part where he stopped the cloned Pikachu from battling Ash's Pikachu fascinated me cause he's the one starting all the battles in the first movie. The most interesting part is the ending. Mewtwo's act of releasing all his cloned pokemon for them to seek freedom rather than keeping them with him nearly made me cry. The whole movie is very, very good! Beside that, the soundtracks in the movie are also very nice.

673235,AY5XWJE0LEYB8,B00005OW0H,jasmine garcia,"[0, 0]","Mewtwo, his caring heart having been softened by the selfless example of the human named Ash Ketchum back in his birthland in the eastern Kanto region, has now traveled to the western region of Johto in search of a location that is unreachable by the prying eyes and harsh judgments of humans for the sake of his band of cloned Pok&eacute;mon, with whose welfare Mewtwo is solely concerned. He eventually finds the perfect hideaway: a huge mountain named Mt. Quena, surrounded by steep cliffs that are practically impossible to scale, but in its top is a forest and a freshwater lake that makes for a near-utopia for all the Bug Pok&eacute;mon living there. This is a perfect fit for Mewtwo's band, so thus they settle in the top of Mt. Quena and begin a new, safe life, with Mewtwo watching over as their guardian, as he feels they cannot belong in the world as they were not born in it (Interestingly enough, he seems particularly close to the Pikachu and Meowth clones, possibly reflecting how important their templates were in his change of heart).At the end of the first movie, Mewtwo erased all memory of the events from all those involved. However, due to his not being on New Island at the time, Giovanni has not forgotten about Mewtwo, and has been concocting a military plan of assault upon wherever Mewtwo has settled to take the Pok&eacute;mon back for himself. He at last locates Mewtwo in his new mountain retreat and begins his operation to assault and capture Mewtwo and bend his will to Giovanni's. The Team Rocket combat unit heads towards Mt. Quena.Ash and his friends and Pikachu, on their Pok&eacute;mon journey as always, are now passing through the area around Mt. Quena, but complications with the weather and the bus service force them to stay at a cabin at the foot of the mountain, where they would meet the Pok&eacute;mon naturalists Luna Carson (voiced by Amy Birnbaum) and Cullen Calix (Scottie Ray) and the spunky girl Domino (Kerry Williams) who works for a Pok&eacute;mon institute. But then a break-in and attempted thievery of Pikachu by the classic antics of the Team Rocket trio Jessie, James, and Meowth, and soon a series of turbulent events involving a scuffle on a hot air balloon, leads everyone into the airspace of Mt. Quena.There everyone sees the approaching Combat Unit, and Domino, revealing herself in league with Team Rocket Organization as elite Agent 009 (or, as she calls herself, The Black Tulip), pops their balloon and sends everyone else plummeting onto the mountain while she returns to Giovanni to report on Mewtwo's status. Giovanni's operation to capture Mewtwo begins in earnest, with Ash and his friends and nemeses caught up in the core of it. Giovanni eventually succeeds in capturing Mewtwo with the threat that the other Pok&eacute;mon clones would be his to capture and experiment if Mewtwo didn't comply. With Ash and the Pok&eacute;mon Clones in custody, Giovanni's operation is successful, and he immediately capitalizes by ordering the construction of a new Team Rocket base on the mountain.The characters and all other cloned Pok&eacute;mon that attempted to protect Mewtwo are then locked away in a prison cell, along with two mother Pok&eacute;mon attempting to protect their offspring. While in the cell Meowth translates what the other Pok&eacute;mon are saying: They're coming... and they're very angry. They're mad at whoever is polluting the lake and they've come to stop them. Domino eventually releases Jessie and James and puts them to work cleaning the new base.Giovanni's greed for new Team Rocket bases becomes his worst mistake; without warning, a swarm of furious Bug Pok&eacute;mon (that Meowth was referring to) from the mountain sabotages the Team Rocket base that is polluting the freshwater lake, and the ensuing chaos allows Ash and everyone with him to escape and scatter. Ash rushes over to Mewtwo, believing that this is the first time he's seen Mewtwo, and he and Brock try to free Mewtwo from the machines that are suppressing his mind and body, partly as thanks for Mewtwo protecting Pikachu earlier. However, Mewtwo is weak from using what was left of his power and strength to destroy the machines that held him, putting his life force in jeopardy, but Ash carries Mewtwo away from Giovanni's battle while Brock, Misty and the other clones along with the bug Pok&eacute;mon keep Team Rocket occupied.Mewtwo asks Ash why he's helping him, to which Ash replies that you don't need a reason to help someone in trouble. Mewtwo reflects that Ash may be one-of-a-kind, but Ash says that everyone is. As they reach the heart of the mountain, Ash throws Mewtwo into a healing spring that restores his power, prompting Mewtwo to finally accept that he is a real Pok&eacute;mon, as the water affects him just as it affected others. The Pok&eacute;mon clone rises and uses all his psychic powers to move the lake and the spring underground, and then uses his mind-erasing powers to clear Giovanni's mind of Mewtwo, the clones, and Mt. Quena. Team Rocket are transported away from the mountain, with the exception of Jessie, James and Meowth, who had hidden in a cave during the battle.Ash, Meowth and various Pok&eacute;mon convince Mewtwo not to erase their minds as well, because though Mewtwo would mean well to do so to keep knowledge of this natural sanctuary hidden from the destructive tendencies of humanity, Ash assures that he would permanently keep the mountain's secret unrevealed at any rate. Mewtwo agrees and personally thanks Ash for all his help and understanding with friendship, love and caring in his heart, and he departs on his own as all the Clone Pok&eacute;mon leave to lead life as natural Pok&eacute;mon in the wild, sending Ash and co. in a Pikachu balloon and Jessie, James and Meowth in their normal balloon. As Ash, Misty and Brock were walking through a city, Ash hears Mewtwo's voice. The narrator concludes the movie with the rumors of a Pok&eacute;mon who traversed the city at night.",5,"mewtwo, a brand new friend.",1343347200,"07 27, 2012",2012,6010,"['Mewtwo', 'caring', 'heart',

673236,AD1JV9Y36NKPQ,B00005OW0H,J. Nickerson,"[2, 2]","Though many assume that this was a movie that went directly to video, Mewtwo Returns is actually a special that was shown on Japanese TV a year or so ago. Basically, at the end of Mewtwo Strikes Back, Mewtwo made everyone forget about him and the events that took place on his island... except for the one who funded his creation, Team Rocket leader Giovanni. After a quick recap, we find that Mewtwo and the clones has settled down on a remote mountain lake in the middle of the Johto region and that Giovanni has tracked him down. As you might expect, Ash and company are in the same area, along with Jessie, James and Meowth. Through a series of events, they all find themselves trying to save Mewtwo and the clones from the clutches of Giovanni and an elite Rocket member, Domino.Visually, this is brighter and sharper than the other movies or episodes. The animation is very good, even with the occasional glitch. The sound is ok, but the music, which was taken from the first movie, has a lot of obvious edits in it.If you were expecting a huge, all-out battle between Mewtwo and Giovanni, you'd be mistaken. The action in this movie is rather tame compared to previous movies. The focus in this movie is more on the brooding Mewtwo and his trying to figure out what his purpose in life is. Older anime fans will love the more mature tastes of this movie (and recent episodes of the series), though younger fans might get bored with it.The DVD has the opening for the latest season of the show, as well as trailers for the last three movies. But true Pokemon fans will gobble up the best feature of the DVD; the uncut version of Mewtwo's Origin. This is really the first ten minutes of Mewtwo Strikes Back that was cut out of the US version, which delves deeper into Mewtwo's cloning and the true reason he was so angry in the first movie. This section of the DVD is shown in widescreen, which is a huge plus. Audio commentary is missed, but it really doesn't detract much from the DVD.Overall, this is highly recommended for Pokemon fans, and even more recommended to win over people who believe Pokemon is just for toddlers.",5,What?

673238,A1EEG7YJIYN60B,B00005OW0H,Lesley Aeschliman,"[0, 0]","WARNING: This review contains potential spoilersMewtwo's heart has been softened after seeing Ash's selflessness in the first Pokemon film.  Mewtwo has traveled to the western region of Johto, searching for somewhere that he and the cloned Pokemon can live that is unreachable by humans in order to live in peace.  He finds a spot at the top of Mt. Quena, which is surrounded by steep cliffs that are hard to scale.  At the top of the mountain is a forest and a freshwater lake that is a home to many bug Pokemon.At the end of the first film, Mewtwo had erased the memories of the events of the first film from those involved in it.  Unfortunately, the head of Team Rocket was not on New Island at the time, so his memory was not erased.  Giovanni has been spending time trying to locate Mewtwo, so he can be recaptured and used for the initial purpose for which he had been created.Meanwhile, Ash, Brock, and Misty are passing through the area near Mt. Quena.  Due to weather complications and missing the bus (which only comes through once a month), the trio end up staying at a cabin located at the foot of the mountain.  The occupant of the cabin is a Pokemon naturalist named Luna Carson.  The group is soon joined by Cullen Callix and Domino.  Jessie, James, and Meowth burst into the cabin and take Pikachu.  As Team Rocket tries to escape in their Meowth balloon, a storm suddenly swoops in and sends the balloon flying in all directions.  Ash and the others must try to rescue Pikachu.  As the special unfolds, it turns out someone isn't who they seem to be, and Mewtwo and the clone Pokemon become involved in the story.The running time for the film is just right for the story being told; it's not so short that the story feels rushed, but it's not so long that the intended child audience becomes bored with it.  However, it should be noted that in order to truly enjoy and understand Mewtwo Returns, a viewer needs to have already seen the first Pokemon film.The character of Mewtwo is rather philosophical in this special; while younger children who watch this may not completely understand Mewtwo's contemplations, it adds a layer that makes this special a more enjoyable viewing experience for adults.  As for the animation in this special, it is a little higher quality than what was seen in the regular television episodes, but it's not as good as the quality of animation used in the theatrical films.This DVD release includes two special features.  The first is labeled as ""The Uncut Story of Mewtwo's Origin.""  This feature includes the first ten minutes of the original Pokemon film that had been cut from the English dub.  In this special, it is revealed that the scientist that helped to create Mewtwo had his own motive for dabbling in cloning; the scientist's daughter had died, and he managed to create his daughter's consciousness and wanted to be able to create a clone of her.  We also see things through Mewtwo's eyes before he escapes from the lab in the first Pokemon film.  After seeing some of the themes included in this section, I can see why 4Kids would have been hesitant to include it in the original Pokemon film when it was released here.  It's also interesting to note that the design of the scientist who lost his daughter bears a strong resemblance to Dr. Tenma from Astro Boy; Tenma was a scientist who lost his son in a tragic accident and created the robot Astro Boy as a way to try to bring back his dead son.  This was a rather eye-opening piece, and some of the concepts included really tie in with what is presented in Mewtwo Returns.The second feature is labeled as ""Johto League Champions.""  This is simply the opening title sequence for one of the Johto region seasons for Pokemon.  Personally, I felt that this was a waste of a bonus feature.Even with its faults, Pokemon: Mewtwo Returns should really be in the DVD library of any Pokemon fan.I wrote this review after watching a copy of this DVD that I checked out through the King County Library System.",4,A follow-up special to Pokemon: The First Movie,1314662400,"08 30, 2011",2011,4011,"['WARNING', 'review', 'potential', 'spoilersMewtwo', 'heart', 'been', 'softened', 'seeing', 'Ash', 'selflessness', 'first', 'Pokemon', 'film', 'Mewtwo', 'traveled', 'western', 'region', 'Johto', 'searching', 'somewhere', 'cloned', 'Pokemon', 'can', 'live', 'unreachable', 'humans', 'order', 'live', 'peace', 'spot', 'top', 'Mt', 'Quena', 'surrounded', 'steep', 'cliffs', 'are', 'hard', 'scale', 'top', 'mountain', 'forest', 'freshwater', 'lake', 'home', 'many', 'bug', 'Pokemon.At', 'end', 'first', 'film', 'Mewtwo', 'had', 'erased', 'memories', 'events', 'first', 'film', 'involved', 'Unfortunately', 'head', 'Team', 'Rocket', 'was', 'not', 'New', 'Island', 'time', 'memory', 'was', 'not', 'erased', 'Giovanni', 'been', 'spending', 'time', 'trying', 'locate', 'Mewtwo', 'can', 'be', 'recaptured', 'used', 'initial', 'purpose', 'had', 'been', 'created.Meanwhile', 'Ash', 'Brock', 'Misty', 'are', 'passing', 'area', 'Mt', 'Quena', 'Due', 'weather', 'complications', 'missing', 'bus', 'only', 'once', 'month', 'trio', 'end', 'up', 'staying', 'cabin', 'located', 'foot', 'mountain', 'occupant', 'cabin', 'Pokemon', 'naturalist', 'named', 'Luna', 'Carson', 'group', 'soon', 'joined', 'Cullen', 'Callix', 'Domino', 'Jessie', 'James', 'Meowth', 'burst', 'cabin', 'take', 'Pikachu', 'Team', 'Rocket', 'escape', 'Meowth', 'balloon', 'storm', 'suddenly', 'balloon', 'flying', 'directions', 'Ash', 'others', 'must', 'try', 'rescue', 'Pikachu', 'special', 'unfolds', 'out', 'someone', ""n't"", 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'Mewtwo', 'clone', 'Pokemon', 'become', 'involved', 'story.The', 'running', 'time', 'film', 'just', 'right', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'not', 'so', 'short', 'story', 'feels', 'rushed', 'not', 'so', 'long', 'intended', 'child', 'audience', 'bored', 'However', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'order', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'understand', 'Mewtwo', 'Returns', 'viewer', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'first', 'Pokemon', 'film.The', 'character', 'Mewtwo', 'rather', 'philosophical', 'special', 'younger', 'children', 'who', 'watch', 'may', 'not', 'completely', 'understand', 'Mewtwo', 'contemplations', 'layer', 'special', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'viewing', 'experience', 'adults', 'animation', 'special', 'little', 'higher', 'quality', 'what', 'was', 'seen', 'regular', 'television', 'episodes', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'quality', 'animation', 'used', 'theatrical', 'films.This', 'DVD', 'release', 'two', 'special', 'features', 'first', 'labeled', 'Uncut', 'Story', 'Mewtwo', 'Origin', 'feature', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'original', 'Pokemon', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'cut', 'English', 'dub', 'special', 'revealed', 'scientist', 'helped', 'create', 'Mewtwo', 'had', 'own', 'motive', 'dabbling', 'cloning', 'scientist', 'daughter', 'had', 'died', 'managed', 'create', 'daughter', 'consciousness', 'wanted', 'be', 'able', 'create', 'clone', 'also', 'see', 'things', 'Mewtwo', 'eyes', 'lab', 'first', 'Pokemon', 'film', 'seeing', 'themes', 'included', 'section', 'can', 'see', 'why', '4Kids', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'hesitant', 'include', 'original', 'Pokemon', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'here', 'also', 'interesting', 'note', 'design', 'scientist', 'who', 'lost', 'daughter', 'strong', 'resemblance', 'Dr.', 'Tenma', 'Astro', 'Boy', 'Tenma', 'was', 'scientist', 'who', 'lost', 'son', 'tragic', 'accident', 'created', 'robot', 'Astro', 'Boy', 'way', 'try', 'bring', 'back', 'dead', 'son', 'was', 'rather', 'eye-opening', 'piece', 'concepts', 'included', 'really', 'tie', 'what', 'presented', 'Mewtwo', 'Returns.The', 'second', 'feature', 'labeled', 'Johto', 'League', 'Champions', 'simply', 'opening', 'title', 'sequence', 'one', 'Johto', 'region', 'seasons', 'Pokemon', 'Personally', 'felt', 'was', 'waste', 'bonus', 'feature.Even', 'faults', 'Pokemon', 'Mewtwo', 'Returns', 'should', 'really', 'be', 'DVD', 'library', 'Pokemon', 'fan.I', 'wrote', 'review', 'watching', 'copy', 'DVD', 'checked', 'out', 'King', 'County', 'Library', 'System']",N/A
673239,AQGCART9DSM8B,B00005OW0H,"""lugia2010""","[4, 4]","A word of warning &#8211; this review is based on the original Japanese version, &#8216;Myuutsuu Ware Wa Koko no Ari&#8217;, and not on the 4Kids&#8217; dub. If the US version is cut, don&#8217;t blame me.I always hoped that there would be a sequel to the first Pok&eacute;mon movie, even if it was only to give 4Kids a chance to redeem themselves from their slapdash work. Thankfully, there *is* going to be a sequel, but whether or not the US dub is going to be any good or not is another matter.When I first saw the original Japanese version of this film in July, I thought that it had a somewhat dark side to it, in comparison to the normal Pok&eacute;mon theme of happy endings and smiling faces. Almost from the word go, we are faced with Mewtwo&#8217;s somewhat troubling emotional problems, and I spent most of the hour wondering when he&#8217;d finally blow a fuse (...). Just like in the upcoming 4th Pok&eacute;mon movie (called &#8216;Celebea &#8211; A Timeless Encounter&#8217; in Japan), &#8216;Mewtwo Returns&#8217; deals with some heavy material in the plot, with some scenes of violence and suffering previously unseen to US Pok&eacute;mon fans.The basic plot is that Giovanni (I&#8217;ll use the US names to avoid confusion) gets wind of the location of Mewtwo&#8217;s new home, secreted on an island hiding in what looks like a hollowed out mountain in the film. Giovanni blackmails Mewtwo into going with him by threatening to hurt the other cloned Pok&eacute;mon living on the island with Mewtwo, and Ash and Co. do their best to prevent this from happening. I don&#8217;t want to give away too much about the ending, so if you want to find out, buy the DVD!Despite the departure from normal Pok&eacute;mon style, &#8216;Mewtwo Returns&#8217; does not disappoint. We still have the now standard bad jokes and mandatory scenes of group laughter, usually at Team Rocket. Once again, we get to see the Pok&eacute;mon world through Mewtwo&#8217;s eyes &#8211; a radically different view from what we&#8217;re used to. The seemingly eternal struggle between Mewtwo&#8217;s conscience and his violent feelings makes for an interesting subplot, and this is what makes me keep coming back to this film and wondering about it.This film is certainly one for any Pok&eacute;mon fan&#8217;s DVD/video library, and I truly hope that it is not spoiled by the 4Kids dub.~Sakurai Charizard07/11/2001",5,Myuutsuu Ware Wa Koko no Ari &#8211; Mewtwo Returns!,1005091200,"11 7, 2001",2001,2404,"['word', 'warning', '8211', 'review', 'based', 'original', 'Japanese', 'version', '8216', 'Myuutsuu', 'Ware', 'Wa', 'Koko', 'Ari', '8217', 'not', '4Kids', '8217', 'dub', 'US', 'version', 'cut', 'don', '8217', 'blame', 'me.I', 'always', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'sequel', 'first', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'mon', 'movie', 'even', 'was', 'only', 'give', '4Kids', 'chance', 'redeem', 'slapdash', 'work', 'Thankfully', 'going', 'be', 'sequel', 'not', 'US', 'dub', 'going', 'be', 'good', 'not', 'matter.When', 'first', 'saw', 'original', 'Japanese', 'version', 'film', 'July', 'thought', 'had', 'somewhat', 'dark', 'side', 'comparison', 'normal', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'mon', 'theme', 'happy', 'endings', 'smiling', 'Almost', 'word', 'go', 'are', 'faced', 'Mewtwo', '8217', 'somewhat', 'troubling', 'emotional', 'problems', 'spent', 'most', 'hour', 'wondering', 'when', '8217', 'd', 'finally', 'blow', 'fuse', 'Just', 'upcoming', '4th', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'mon', 'movie', 'called', '8216', 'Celebea', '8211', 'A', 'Timeless', 'Encounter', '8217', 'Japan', '8216', 'Mewtwo', 'Returns', '8217', 'deals', 'heavy', 'material', 'plot', 'scenes', 'violence', 'suffering', 'previously', 'unseen', 'US', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'fans.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'Giovanni', '8217', 'use', 'US', 'names', 'avoid', 'confusion', 'wind', 'location', 'Mewtwo', '8217', 'new', 'home', 'secreted', 'island', 'hiding', 'what', 'hollowed', 'out', 'mountain', 'film', 'Giovanni', 'Mewtwo', 'going', 'threatening', 'hurt', 'other', 'cloned', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'living', 'island', 'Mewtwo', 'Ash', 'Co.', 'do', 'best', 'prevent', 'happening', 'don', '8217', 'want', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'ending', 'so', 'want', 'find', 'out', 'buy', 'DVD', 'departure', 'normal', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'mon', 'style', '8216', 'Mewtwo', 'Returns', '8217', 'not', 'disappoint', 'still', 'have', 'now', 'standard', 'bad', 'jokes', 'mandatory', 'scenes', 'group', 'laughter', 'usually', 'Team', 'Rocket', 'Once', 'again', 'get', 'see', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'mon', 'world', 'Mewtwo', '8217', 'eyes', '8211', 'radically', 'different', 'view', 'what', '8217', 're', 'used', 'seemingly', 'eternal', 'struggle', 'Mewtwo', '8217', 'conscience', 'violent', 'feelings', 'interesting', 'subplot', 'what', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'film', 'wondering', 'it.This', 'film', 'certainly', 'one', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'fan', '8217', 'DVD/video', 'library', 'truly', 'hope', 'not', 'spoiled', '4Kids', 'dub.~Sakurai', 'Charizard07/11/2001']",N/A

I never got hooked until about a year ago, when I finally got tired of hearing pokemon this and pokemon that and decided to see what it was all about.  I got a gameboy color and a game and rented the first movie.  The rest is history.For pokemon, this story is much darker in nature than usual. It hasn't had this tone of storyline since Mewtwo first appeared.  Mewtwo is no longer a desperately angry pokemon bent on vengence, for Ash opened his heart and showd him something he had never seen before.  Now all he wants for himself and his fellow clones is to live in peace, far away from humanity, a secluded corner on a world that to Mewtwo, he feels he does not even belong on.However, Giovanni's desire to control Mewtwo never faded.  He's tracked down Mewtwo via satellite and sets up a trap to lure Mewtwo back into his clutches.  Unfortunately for him, Ash and company are also around.  It all comes down to the fate of Mewtwo being soley in Ash's hands.....can he make it?  Can Mewtwo ever learn if he does belong to this world....or will he always think himself an outcast?The DVD also comes with a great Bonus Feature--the *uncut* version of Mewtwo's Origin.  Folks, there's much more to the early days of Mewtwo's development than they ever showed us before.  It involves a girl named Amber (I think she was named Ai in the original), a Charmander, Squirtle, and Bulbasaur--all clones.  That's all I'll say, but the uncut version is also pretty dark in nature.  I cried the first time I saw it.Get this and enjoy it!  Sit down, relax!

The script translations were very faithful, the voices were good, and the overall story was just plain enjoyable.The film is pretty much showing what happened to Mewtwo and everyone else after the first film &quot;Mewtwo Strikes Back&quot;, and how in the end, everyone's memory from the battle was erased.  If anyone had watched the dubbed version of MSB like I did, you'll notice that the dubbed musical soundtrack makes its way back in the TV Special.A lot of the original music does make its way in, however, during the silent scenes of the original version, the score in the dubbed version of MSB was placed in this special as well.  The music isn't bad, however, the cues were done rather poorly, and some of the songs were repeated a few times.  Where they cut in and cut out didn't sound too well overall, and this was my only beef with this.Some scenes are quite violent, however they are not as violent as the first movie.  Still, some of the younger children in the audience may not be too comfortable with some of the scenes, and the older fans of the show may rejoice that no actual footage of this TV special was lost.And of course, it's not Pok&eacute;mon if there's no moral to the story, and this story has a very good one.  What, expecting me to say it?  No way, I'll leave that to you to hear what it's about ~_^.4Kids has done it again.

673247,AID8OJP77VK6Y,B00005OW0H,unicornelia,"[6, 6]","Even though Suicune is a favorite pokemon of mine, 'Pokemon 4ever' just wasn't quite good enough overall to be my favorite movie. The third film contained a memorable song by Innosense, but again, one song wasn't enough. And Pokemon 2000 included some good Team Rocket content. But the best pokemon movie, in my opinion, is 'Mewtwo Returns.' The story is still rather basic, with Giovanni being the main villain and Ash & company being the heroes, along with Mewtwo and all the other pokemon, genetically enhanced clones or not. Yet there are some very poignant messages brought forth by the movie, and the animation is quite nice, not appearing to have been tossed together quickly without care. This movie might have been a direct-to-video job, but it was a great one.Ash finds himself worried that a source of miraculous water with healing powers will be discovered and ruined. Mewtwo struggles to resist capture and having his spirit broken by the ruthless Team Rocket leader Giovanni. And the rifts between cloned pokemon and 'normal' ones are explored and eventually smoothed over. What makes this movie most enjoyable for me is the introduction (and sadly, the first and only meeting) of a new Team Rocket agent, young Domino, aka the Black Tulip, agent 009. Multi-faceted and brilliant as Cassidy, whom she slightly resembles (blonde with violet eyes), Domino is a character who adds interest and fun to the film. She seems like a perfect little Swiss girl (with that swirly blonde hair, clothes that match the colors of the Swiss flag, & a convincing portrayal of a hiker, the way she looks like she could be in a lodge wearing a green L.L.Bean sweater...not to mention that we don't know her real name. Domino suggests Dominique, which is French & thus potentially associated with Switzerland). But she turns out to be one slick Rocket agent with mad fighting skills.I would go with 'Mewtwo Returns' if I had to pick one pokemon movie to see.
