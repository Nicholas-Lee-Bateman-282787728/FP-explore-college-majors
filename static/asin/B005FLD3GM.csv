Gary isn't a great singer? Neither was Hendrix. Gary is fatter?Yeah, and? When people think of Hendrix they think guitar. When I think of Gary I think guitar, period. In his hard rock heyday there wasn't a guitarist alive I would havetaken over Gary. Not Blackmore, not Schenker, not Eddie Van Halen, etc. It's not a question of being better than those guys, I loved how Gary played. I loved his passion,his attitude on guitar, his ferociousness. He played like the ship was going down. And he had some serious guitar chops. Listen to his work with Colosseum II.I love Gary's blues stuff but his hard rock playing does it for me.

1458952,AW1493ZQTQ2ET,B005FLD3GM,Irfan A. Alvi,"[0, 0]","I'm not typical of people who would buy this DVD.  I've played guitar for more than three decades and always knew Gary Moore was out there and considered a fine guitarist, but I rarely heard much of his music, and what I did hear didn't have much impact on me.  But lately, with so much concert footage coming out on DVD, including Blu-ray, I've been building up a collection.  It made sense to get something from Moore, and I went with this particular concert because of the strong reviews.  So I didn't come to this as a Moore fan, just a fan of guitar.Verdict?  The positive side is that Moore is definitely a great guitarist, with chops and passion galore.  But the negative side for me (it's subjective) is that I frankly find most of the songs to be rather simple and even boring.  While he was a great guitarist, I don't think he was a great composer, and that might help explain why he didn't achieve the acclaim of people like Hendrix, Page, Van Halen, Beck, etc.In contrast to this, I did find some footage online where Moore plays blues and Hendrix songs, and there he really shines.  So my conclusion is that, while this DVD may be great for Moore fans, people in my category may prefer his performances where he plays the music of others, several of which are apparently available on DVD.  Combining great songs with Moore's playing is definitely potent!",3,For fans of Gary Moore,1404086400,"06 30, 2014",2014,1367,"[""'m"", 'not', 'typical', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'buy', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'played', 'guitar', 'more', 'three', 'decades', 'always', 'knew', 'Gary', 'Moore', 'was', 'there', 'considered', 'fine', 'guitarist', 'rarely', 'heard', 'much', 'music', 'what', 'did', 'hear', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'impact', 'lately', 'so', 'much', 'concert', 'footage', 'coming', 'out', 'DVD', 'including', 'Blu-ray', ""'ve"", 'been', 'building', 'up', 'collection', 'made', 'sense', 'get', 'something', 'Moore', 'went', 'particular', 'concert', 'strong', 'reviews', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'Moore', 'fan', 'just', 'fan', 'guitar.Verdict', 'positive', 'side', 'Moore', 'definitely', 'great', 'guitarist', 'chops', 'passion', 'galore', 'negative', 'side', 'subjective', 'frankly', 'find', 'most', 'songs', 'be', 'rather', 'simple', 'even', 'boring', 'was', 'great', 'guitarist', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'great', 'composer', 'might', 'help', 'explain', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'achieve', 'acclaim', 'people', 'Hendrix', 'Page', 'Van', 'Halen', 'Beck', 'etc.In', 'contrast', 'did', 'find', 'footage', 'online', 'where', 'Moore', 'blues', 'Hendrix', 'songs', 'there', 'really', 'conclusion', 'DVD', 'may', 'be', 'great', 'Moore', 'fans', 'people', 'category', 'may', 'prefer', 'performances', 'where', 'music', 'others', 'several', 'are', 'apparently', 'available', 'DVD', 'Combining', 'great', 'songs', 'Moore', 'playing', 'definitely', 'potent']",N/A

His Playing, his voice, and the tightness of the band is spot on.The proof is in the pudding, watch and listen to the  audience you can see it in their faces and hear it in their voices.I have read some of the other reviews and I was appalled that some would fault Mr. Moore for getting old!Talking about the weight gain and voice not as good.Let me say getting old is part of life and some of our bodies handle it differently.Some loose all their hair, some put on wait in our middles, some our voices change. Shall I go on?On that note I have been a fan from the beginning Skid Row and followed Gary through the years. I have all his music, and I love it.Seeing him in one of his last performances, I consider it a very special moment in his life.on a scale of 1 to 10 I give this concert a 20!!After watching I did not run and get a older concert to watch I put it back in and watched a second time.

But in my humble opinion his voice was bad because his health was obviously , obviously bad. Goodness... I love this artist, and I can't believe his friends, loved ones, and management let him put on such an enormous amount of weight around his mid section without getting him to a doctor?  His heart attack is no shock given these images and they frankly make it very hard for me to enjoy this DVD with the near future heart attack in the back of my mind. Sure I love his playing...like the return to some less frequently recorded repertoire and LOVE the new songs....and anytime Gary Moore is playing a Les Paul and I can watch I'm a happy boy. The bonus footage from 1997 shows how dramatically his weight had ballooned and even in the superlative concert Blu Ray for Phil LynottGary Moore & Friends: One Night in Dublin - A Tribute to Phil Lynott [Blu-ray] Gary was showing an expanding waist line and really sweating up a storm!Due to the great playing and the low price I have to keep this a five star rating even though its with a heavy heart that I watch it.
