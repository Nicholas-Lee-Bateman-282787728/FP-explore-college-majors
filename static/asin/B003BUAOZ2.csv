The concert was originally scheduled for November 2008 but due to health issues Celine was experiencing it was rescheduled for January 3, 2009. After a few songs Celine addressed the audience, explaining that she absolutely hates postponing shows and that she was truly sorry. I could tell that she was being sincere. The show lasted nearly three hours. I believe it was her way of saying sorry. Her outfits were phenomenal. I was sitting directly in front of her when she was singing Eyes on Me with that massive parachute billowing off her shoulders. Talk about couture! When she finished performing her new song My Love I had tears streaming down my face. This was a night I will never forget!As to the CD/DVD combo, my only disappointment is that there is not a blu-ray version of the concert itself. The concert was filmed in high definition so I'm hoping that they will release a HD version. Another reviewer stated that he was disappointed that there were not special features included on the DVD. That may be but on the day this hit the streets they also released the documentary Celine Dion Through The Eyes Of The World. It's nearly three hours of behind the scenes footage combined with performances from her tour stops. If you want to see special features pick upCeline: Through the Eyes of the World.

Very rarely do you get both for a great price!Recorded in Boston, MA, Celine delivers a wonderful redition of all her hits and much more. Including a VIDEO duet with Andre Boccelli. Listening to this concert in the car was just as exciting to watch her perform it live on the DVD included!She is warm, she has energy and very much a lot of heart. If you are looking for an entertaining CD - as far as live concerts go - and one of her better concert DVD's I've seen to date- then this DUEL pack is for you.I believe even the non-Celine fan would really enjoy this - simply because from her opening 'I'll Drive all Night' to her over-welming ovation ending 'My Heart Will Go On' - she captures the essence of the modern female pop icon.

I really wasn't much of a fan of the ""Taking Chances"" album and the songs here didn't thrill me. Although, ""Eye's On Me"" was nicely performed with all the dancers. I was pleased to see ""The Prayer"" on here though. But after watching the documentary, I guess she threw in a lot of other songs throughout her tour that I would really have liked to have seen. Lastly, I have to mention her vocals during this concert. She sounded very nasal and her voice sounded tired. Her voice even started to give out at the end of ""All By Myself."" Watch any over her other tour videos in the past and she has sounded a lot better. She is working too hard and it is starting to show. This is a nice concert to watch, but I will probably never listen to the CD because just the audio without the visual is not good enough. I also have to mention that I was let down that there was no section in the concert where Celine gives credit to her band. She has always done this in the past but not here. Maybe it was edited out but it's always one of my favorite parts of the show.On the plus side, the show is put together very well. The stage is beautiful and there is always a lot going on. The dancers are also excellent. I feel they work much better with Celine here than they did in Vegas. Other than that, it is always a joy to watch Celine perform. She's probably the greatest female performer living today.I really wish they would release the French version of this tour though. They show some of it in the documentary and it left me wanting more.

VH1 Divas Live doesn't count and Concert DVDs were pricey in the 1990s. Perhaps I was also gravely mistaken, thinking she will just stand there and sing her ballads.Taking Chances Tour proved me totally wrong. It was one heck of a show and this spectacular totally took my breath away. The unconventional stage set up comprises a centrally located square stage set with trap doors and conveyor belts to ensure that Celine and Co travel round the stadium easily to meet fans. And also to appear and disappear in style.The set list is a crowd pleaser. Watching the show, I kind of forgot that Celine is essentially a covers singer. When she sings hits by other artists she just makes the songs her own. Look at I Drove All Night (Cyndi Lauper, Roy Orbison). All By Myself (Eric Carmen) and Alone (Heart). For The Power Of Love (Jennifer Rush), I wished she sang the album version as I thought the ending was too sudden.Of course there are the true Celine originals. Because You Loved Me, To Love You More and the haunting Titanic weepie My Heart Will Go On. There are some surprises. A Queen tribute and a duet with Andre Bocelli via the drop box screens centerstage. Plus a tender French rendition of If That's What It Takes.The show is well paced, well thought out and choreographed. Celine and Co put on energetic, spirited performances. The ladies might also want to check out her tastefully understated wardrobe.This is my first Celine DVD and subjectively speaking it is a simply a must!

It was one of the most gratifying experiences ever! Being 20 at the time of the Vegas run, I was unable to attend so i knew for a fact that i had to catch her act on the road. I was very excited when i entered the arena and saw a center stage set up. When i got to my seats, I was a little skeptical of the crowd. I was surrounded by a 45+ crowd. There were sporadic groups of young, cute, gay guys, and i was about to give my tickets up and go join them, since they're a crowd i related to.All jokes aside- the show started; a video montage of Celine on a soundstage appears on a cubed video wall place on the center of the stage- running to a wonderful remix of ""I Drove All Night"". Then appeared images of Celine on major stops of her tour; Paris, Dublin, New York, Los Angeles. As the video nears the end, words appear on the screen ""Tonight: San Jose,"" queing the screens to raise revealing Celine standing in the middle of the stage. She turns to each of the 4 sides of the arena to greet the audience then kicks into I Drove All Night. Then follows some greats: The Power of Love, Taking Chances, It's all coming back/ Because you loved me/ To love you more.A fashion video montage appears playing to a remix of ""My Heart Will Go On,"" which then kicks into the 2nd act of the show with songs that include All Eyes on Me, All By Myself, I'm Alive, Shadow of Love, Fade Away and Alone. My favorite moment of the night proceeds these songs: My Love. Sitting by a baby grand piano, she starts the song acapella, then kicks into the chorus alongside the piano. 3/4 of the way through the song, the piano stops...silence...then, Celine hits one of the high notes with a chilling run that she is best known for, causing a hysteria of applause, screams, and tears. As the song ends, Celine joins the audience with tears of her own. To close this act of the show, she performs The Prayer ( a duet with Andrea Bocelli via video screen), followed by Pour que Tu M'aimes Encore.Then follows a tribute to Queen- ""We Will Rock You"" and ""The Show Must Go On,"" then follows a soul medley that include the hits ""Sex Machine,"" ""Soul Man,"" ""Lady Marmalade,"" and ""It's a man's man's man's world."" ""Love Can Move Mountains"" is next before Celine is taken down on the lift for another constume change. Dressed as a Vegas showgirl, she performs ""River Deep, Mountain High,"" my second favorite moment of the night.Encore? ""My Heart Will Go On,"" of course! This performance shows that the only thing a great singer needs to wow an audience is the voice. Positioned Center stage, with a spotlight, and a gorgeous black dress, Celine belts her signature song like no other! Unfortunately, this calls for the end of the show. Giving her thanks, she descends on the lift, as the music fades.By far one of the best concerts i have ever been to. If you want to see what goes on on a tour, i definitely recomment the accompanyingCeline: Through the Eyes of the WorldDVD. I was grateful i was able to attend the 2nd highest grossing female tour of all time!",5,One of the best shows EVER.,1270425600,"04 5, 2010",2010,3109,"['had', 'priviledge', 'seeing', 'Celine', 'Taking', 'Chances', 'Tour', '5th', 'row', 'center', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'gratifying', 'experiences', 'ever', 'Being', '20', 'time', 'Vegas', 'run', 'was', 'unable', 'attend', 'so', 'i', 'knew', 'fact', 'i', 'had', 'catch', 'act', 'road', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'when', 'i', 'entered', 'arena', 'saw', 'center', 'stage', 'set', 'up', 'When', 'i', 'got', 'seats', 'was', 'little', 'skeptical', 'crowd', 'was', 'surrounded', '45+', 'crowd', 'were', 'sporadic', 'groups', 'young', 'cute', 'gay', 'guys', 'i', 'was', 'give', 'tickets', 'up', 'go', 'join', ""'re"", 'crowd', 'i', 'related', 'to.All', 'jokes', 'aside-', 'show', 'started', 'video', 'montage', 'Celine', 'soundstage', 'cubed', 'video', 'wall', 'place', 'center', 'stage-', 'running', 'wonderful', 'remix', 'Drove', 'Night', 'Then', 'appeared', 'images', 'Celine', 'major', 'stops', 'tour', 'Paris', 'Dublin', 'New', 'York', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'video', 'end', 'words', 'appear', 'screen', 'Tonight', 'San', 'Jose', 'queing', 'screens', 'raise', 'revealing', 'Celine', 'standing', 'middle', 'stage', '4', 'sides', 'arena', 'greet', 'audience', 'then', 'Drove', 'All', 'Night', 'Then', 'greats', 'Power', 'Love', 'Taking', 'Chances', 'coming', 'back/', 'loved', 'me/', 'love', 'more.A', 'fashion', 'video', 'montage', 'playing', 'remix', 'My', 'Heart', 'Will', 'Go', 'then', '2nd', 'act', 'show', 'songs', 'include', 'Eyes', 'Me', 'All', 'Myself', ""'m"", 'Alive', 'Shadow', 'Love', 'Fade', 'Away', 'Alone', 'favorite', 'moment', 'night', 'proceeds', 'songs', 'Love', 'Sitting', 'baby', 'grand', 'piano', 'song', 'acapella', 'then', 'chorus', 'piano', '3/4', 'way', 'song', 'piano', 'stops', 'silence', 'then', 'Celine', 'one', 'high', 'notes', 'chilling', 'run', 'best', 'known', 'causing', 'hysteria', 'applause', 'screams', 'tears', 'song', 'Celine', 'audience', 'tears', 'own', 'close', 'act', 'show', 'Prayer', 'duet', 'Andrea', 'Bocelli', 'video', 'screen', 'followed', 'Pour', 'que', 'Tu', ""M'aimes"", 'Encore.Then', 'tribute', 'Queen-', 'Will', 'Rock', 'Show', 'Must', 'Go', 'then', 'soul', 'medley', 'include', 'hits', 'Sex', 'Machine', 'Soul', 'Man', 'Lady', 'Marmalade', 'man', 'man', 'man', 'world', 'Love', 'Can', 'Move', 'Mountains', 'next', 'Celine', 'taken', 'down', 'lift', 'constume', 'change', 'Dressed', 'Vegas', 'showgirl', 'River', 'Deep', 'Mountain', 'High', 'second', 'favorite', 'moment', 'night.Encore', 'Heart', 'Will', 'Go', 'course', 'performance', 'only', 'thing', 'great', 'singer', 'needs', 'wow', 'audience', 'voice', 'Positioned', 'Center', 'stage', 'spotlight', 'gorgeous', 'black', 'dress', 'Celine', 'signature', 'song', 'other', 'Unfortunately', 'end', 'show', 'Giving', 'thanks', 'lift', 'music', 'fades.By', 'far', 'one', 'best', 'concerts', 'i', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'tour', 'i', 'definitely', 'recomment', 'accompanyingCeline', 'Eyes', 'WorldDVD', 'was', 'grateful', 'i', 'was', 'able', 'attend', '2nd', 'highest', 'grossing', 'female', 'tour', 'time']",N/A
