The first Insidious scared the bajeebers out of me and was a movie that I continued to think about and could still creep me out long after I had watched it. So I had pretty high expectations for Chapter 2. It picked up right where the first one left off but this one just never got to the crazy creepy level that the other one did. Chapter 2 also introduced two bumbling idiots ghost hunters that added some comedy to the movie. I don't know why scary movies do this and I suppose there are people that like it but to me this just cheapens the movie. Overall this was a good scary movie but it just doesn't compare to the first one. There is one crazy twist but it becomes apparent almost right away in the movie. The end does leave way for a 3rd installment...,4,Good scary movie,1391126400,"01 31, 2014",2014,779,"['Good..', 'not', 'great', 'first', 'Insidious', 'scared', 'bajeebers', 'was', 'movie', 'continued', 'think', 'could', 'still', 'creep', 'out', 'long', 'had', 'watched', 'had', 'pretty', 'high', 'expectations', 'Chapter', '2', 'picked', 'up', 'right', 'where', 'first', 'one', 'left', 'off', 'one', 'just', 'never', 'got', 'crazy', 'creepy', 'level', 'other', 'one', 'did', 'Chapter', '2', 'also', 'introduced', 'two', 'bumbling', 'idiots', 'ghost', 'hunters', 'added', 'comedy', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'scary', 'movies', 'do', 'suppose', 'are', 'people', 'just', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'scary', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'compare', 'first', 'one', 'one', 'crazy', 'twist', 'apparent', 'almost', 'right', 'away', 'movie', 'end', 'leave', 'way', '3rd', 'installment']",N/A

James Wan is one of the best directors of recent times and he makes his stand by offering two awesome horror movies this year. I personally preferred Insidious 2 though, as I appreciated the rich character development and the concept of the Further. There are clear references to The Shining and Psycho but this movie leaves its own mark of disturbing. Of course it's always great to add some light humor in between to dilute the scares (as they REALLY packed a punch in this second installment). So if you're kind of doubting the movie based on its bad rep, don't listen to the negative comments/reviews as this is easily one of the best movies this year.

Insidious broke no new ground, but everything in it worked. Now James Wan dumps the sequel in theaters to a lackluster reaction from critics (no surprise), and right on the heels of The Conjuring. I wasn't expecting much. A few laughs and intriguing suspense would have satisfied my expectations. Instead, the editing in this movie is possibly the SLOPPIEST job I have seen on film in recent memory. One scene jumps to another with little lead-in or explanation, all kinds of lame plot elements are thrown in, and the demon fails to make an appearance. That last part, being the demon's absence, is what made the first installment such a kickass flick. The cast is the same, but rather than borrowing elements from Poltergeist, the entire movie takes a turn into The Shining territory, with hints of latter-day Elm Street lameness.

Ackley ""jumpstudios""","[0, 0]","The original film ""Insidious"" was a horror film with a twist and such it's sequel, ""insidious:  chapter 2"" continues that trend. I won't spoil the original film for those who have not seen it but be aware that ""insidious 2"" picks up right where the first film left off. What appreciate about this film is that while it reference the original film we are not offered a rehash of the first film as horror films often do. If you prefer your scary film sequels to be the same film with a new batch of victims you will be disappointed.In defense of the critics who say this movie is not scary I would say that they are correct if they are looking for the jump out of your scares often invoked by a loud noise or a bit of on screen action that happens to startle like a dog jumping out during a quiet scene. This film has its scary moments much like Kubrick's the shining- they are quiet, suspenseful and full of dread.What truly shines for this film is how the story is integrated into the first film. As the film explored the characters past and and work towards resolving the issues the writers brilliantly fuse the two films together.This film will entertain those who desire more than a teenage bloodbath or cheap ghost scares.

Insidious 2 is a lame ripoff, trying to ride on the coattails of success from the first movie, without making any effort to be worthy on it's own merit. The over-used Jump Scares of quiet passages of conversation or quietly peering about in the creepy house, looking for the lame-looking Ghosts, followed by the predictable LOUD bang or boom noise to unnerve you, got old very fast. And the constant close-ups of the horrified women, with their staring eyes wide open, and their mouths hanging wide open, every time one of them appeared frightened by some unknown scare, just out of sight of the camera, was also over-used to the point of being laughable. Then, there were the several times that women or one of the kids was doing the fake crying act, but NO tears, which has become standard, and acceptable in today's Hollywood productions. Then, there are the predictable, stereotypical Hollywood  characters, of the woman victim, the white male, unstable killer, who is abusive towards the woman, and the token black, positive, role model, Business Professional, in this case, a Psychologist ( usually a Police Chief, or Investigator, Medical Professional, or Case Worker,...who is there to provide support for the mentally/physically abused white female lead character.)Then, there are the Scares: The over-used routine of the poorly made up Ghosts (pasty looking white people, wearing tattered white sheets. Then, there was the possessed kid doing the silent, Zombie-like finger-pointing act at the dark closet, or the dark-empty room, or down the empty hallway. Then the fake looking Ghosts doing the same Zombie-like, silent pointing act. This too,  as a spooky effect,  lost it's credibility as a spooky effect, just from being over-used. Then here were the Ghost people. First, there were too many of them, that all looked alike, and second,....they just looked like regular people with white make-up on their faces, and the give-away red around the eyeballs, which reminded you that they were just regular people, made up to look like Ghosts. Wearing low budget tattered white sheets, some wearing the sheets over their heads. No CGI Special Effects here.If this movie hadn't had such poor Directing, which regurgitated over-used special effects, that have become standard in all the recent el-Cheapo horror sequels, and hadn't tried to give itself credibility, by constantly relying on flashbacks from the first movie, and had used better effects for spookiness, instead of fake-looking Ghost people, and loud Jump-scare noises, and Hollywood Politically-Correct character role stereotyping.....maybe it might have had a chance to be better.  This had all the appearances of a last minute production, slapped together, to try to ride what was left of the success of the first movie.

Sawin,"[3, 11]","""Insidious"" went on to become one (really wanted to say ""Wan"" instead of ""one"" here) of the most profitable films of 2011 and one of the most talked about horror films of the past few years despite having such a small budget. Most people seemed to really enjoy it, but its extremely loud music and repetitive use of cheap and jump out scares became tiresome overall. Now, two years later, ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" has been released and director James Wan swears it's his swan song to the horror genre. If that's the case, then Wan really should have stepped out of the game with ""The Conjuring.""Like its predecessor, the most intriguing segments of ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" take place in The Further. The music isn't nearly as obnoxious this time around. In fact, other than the music used with the title card and closing credits, the score of the film is much more subdued otherwise. The moments of complete silence are still there, but the music is much more restrained, softer, and less ""in your face,"" which is a very gratifying alteration.The scenes that take place in The Further are the creepiest aside from the closet sequence with Dalton and a tin can telephone. The manner in which ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" connects to the first film is more complicated and interesting than you're initially lead to believe. Patrick Wilson's performance seems a little rough at first, but evolves into this enigma that's much more spellbinding. He's extremely off-putting at times and yet you're mesmerized by the duress that Josh is being put through.The original was a little slow at times, but the sequel feels like it takes an even longer amount of time to get things rolling. Events like the piano playing itself, baby toys going off on their own, strange women walking the halls, and a baby monitor being used like a lifeline are all that awaits you in the first half of the film. The importance of the sound of a metronome or hearing a clock tick in the background is intriguing, but isn't enough to really immerse the audience in a return to this world.Poor Rose Byrne seems to have returned just to get the crap beaten out of her for the sequel. She gets the hell slapped out of her by a poltergeist, has a teapot thrown at her back at full force by a grown man, and gets thrown across the room. ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is much more comedic in comparison to the original. Specs (Leigh Whannell) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) are nothing but pure comedic relief with their hunter-ninja-bear game, the quesadilla/unicorn code word argument, and the entire tranquilizer sequence. The ending is predictable sequel bait that seems thrown in just to keep the franchise going after Wan's exit. Don't expect any answers after the credits either because there's nothing there.""Insidious: Chapter 2"" has a slower pace and a lighter, goofier tone than the original film. The jump-out scares have been tucked away and are more methodical in execution. However the sequel will likely not be as much of a crowd-pleaser as ""Insidious."" There's no doubt ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" will be profitable. It'll likely take first place opening weekend and be successful based on the positive reputation of the first film alone, but the sequel will more than likely be seen as a disappointment that doesn't live up to its predecessor.",2,Just ignore it and it'll go away,1379030400,"09 13, 2013",2013,3301,"['Insidious', 'went', 'become', 'one', 'really', 'wanted', 'say', 'Wan', 'instead', 'one', 'here', 'most', 'profitable', 'films', '2011', 'one', 'most', 'talked', 'horror', 'films', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'having', 'small', 'budget', 'Most', 'people', 'seemed', 'really', 'enjoy', 'extremely', 'loud', 'music', 'repetitive', 'use', 'cheap', 'jump', 'out', 'scares', 'became', 'tiresome', 'overall', 'Now', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'Insidious', 'Chapter', '2', 'been', 'released', 'director', 'James', 'Wan', 'swan', 'song', 'horror', 'genre', 'case', 'then', 'Wan', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'stepped', 'game', 'Conjuring', 'predecessor', 'most', 'intriguing', 'segments', 'Insidious', 'Chapter', '2', 'take', 'place', 'Further', 'music', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'obnoxious', 'time', 'around', 'fact', 'other', 'music', 'used', 'title', 'card', 'closing', 'credits', 'score', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'subdued', 'otherwise', 'moments', 'complete', 'silence', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'music', 'much', 'more', 'restrained', 'softer', 'less', 'face', 'very', 'gratifying', 'alteration.The', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'Further', 'are', 'creepiest', 'aside', 'closet', 'sequence', 'Dalton', 'tin', 'can', 'telephone', 'manner', 'Insidious', 'Chapter', '2', 'connects', 'first', 'film', 'more', 'complicated', 'interesting', ""'re"", 'initially', 'lead', 'believe', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'performance', 'little', 'rough', 'first', 'enigma', 'much', 'more', 'spellbinding', 'extremely', 'off-putting', 'times', 'yet', ""'re"", 'mesmerized', 'duress', 'Josh', 'being', 'put', 'through.The', 'original', 'was', 'little', 'slow', 'times', 'sequel', 'feels', 'even', 'longer', 'amount', 'time', 'get', 'things', 'rolling', 'Events', 'piano', 'playing', 'baby', 'toys', 'going', 'off', 'own', 'strange', 'women', 'walking', 'halls', 'baby', 'monitor', 'being', 'used', 'lifeline', 'are', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'importance', 'sound', 'metronome', 'hearing', 'clock', 'tick', 'background', 'intriguing', ""n't"", 'enough', 'really', 'immerse', 'audience', 'return', 'world.Poor', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'have', 'returned', 'just', 'get', 'crap', 'sequel', 'hell', 'slapped', 'poltergeist', 'teapot', 'thrown', 'back', 'full', 'force', 'grown', 'man', 'thrown', 'room', 'Insidious', 'Chapter', '2', 'much', 'more', 'comedic', 'comparison', 'original', 'Specs', 'Leigh', 'Whannell', 'Tucker', 'Angus', 'Sampson', 'are', 'nothing', 'pure', 'comedic', 'relief', 'hunter-ninja-bear', 'game', 'quesadilla/unicorn', 'code', 'word', 'argument', 'entire', 'tranquilizer', 'sequence', 'ending', 'predictable', 'sequel', 'bait', 'thrown', 'just', 'keep', 'franchise', 'going', 'Wan', 'exit', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'answers', 'credits', 'nothing', 'there', 'Insidious', 'Chapter', '2', 'slower', 'pace', 'lighter', 'goofier', 'tone', 'original', 'film', 'jump-out', 'scares', 'have', 'been', 'tucked', 'away', 'are', 'more', 'methodical', 'execution', 'However', 'sequel', 'will', 'likely', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'much', 'crowd-pleaser', 'Insidious', 'doubt', 'Insidious', 'Chapter', '2', 'will', 'be', 'profitable', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'take', 'first', 'place', 'opening', 'weekend', 'be', 'successful', 'based', 'positive', 'reputation', 'first', 'film', 'alone', 'sequel', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'seen', 'disappointment', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'predecessor']",N/A

To be fair I start with the pros, but there are few.What &#34;Insidious 2&#34; does very well is maintain its pace. There is never a dull moment and there are many &#34;great&#34; films that can't claim that. It will hold your attention. There are a few genuinely creepy moments (which will be picked at in a moment), but the legitimate scares become corrupted very quickly.The main problem with this film seems to come from over-eagerness. The frantic pacing which holds your attention also manages to confuse and promote irritation. An example would be (spoiler free), they are seeking a female ghost and go to a hospital. There they have a vision of a male ghost and start to follow his history. There is absolutely no explanation of why they think one is connected to the other - if at all.The largest disappointment comes from the &#34;cheap tricks&#34;. Every single &#34;scarey moment&#34; is punctuated by an incredibly loud blast of discordant music. That is what causes you to jump. I do not exaggerate when I say incredibly loud. I turned down the volume because of it but was no longer able to understand the dialogue. I had to chose between hearing what was going on or the headache that was being induced.The timing was also off in many ways. There are two &#34;ghost hunters&#34; (though you don't realize that's who they are until quite a ways in) who are really supposed to be comic relief (one of them being the film's author). The gags would have worked, and worked well - if but for two things. First, each of the gags has been done to death in many other films. The other is the incredibly poor either editing or directing in the execution. A lot of humor is tied to timing and this one thing that was sorely missing. Those few necessary beats that turn a punch line from a laugh to &#34;huh?&#34; are never there.Overall this film is a waste of money for purchase and I regret the momentary lapse of reason which prompted the sale. I was still riding high from &#34;The Conjuring&#34;. If there was a bright side to dropping the cash it is this, I have once again learned the lesson of renting before purchasing.",3,Insidious 2?

Take a look at the pros and cons list.Pros+All The Same actors/writers/director return for the sequel+3 Scenes in the film worth atleast watching onceCons-Weak storyline-Not frightening at all (the first was done really well and gave me a run for my money a few times)-Comedy was over done (Not here and there to keep things a little light, but like in every scene)-NOT ENOUGH TIME IN THE FURTHER! (Just like the hellraiser series, give us more PINHEAD! Seriously tho, the first film was paced great and the sequel follows the same pacing?! Its the sequel, supposed to have more of what the first lacked? More of The Further is what I came for and didnt get)-Same old Same old, if you have been watching horror films for a few years you will see half the film done over many times. I got bored with it, predictable.All in all, its worth watching once. I wouldnt buy just rent or go check out in the theaters. In Theory, if you liked the first then you WONT like the second due to the fact that all the things that made the first great where missing in the second. **Dear Internet Trolls, I dont care to hear your opinion.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 1]","&#34;Insidious&#34; ended with a gloriously creepy cliffhanger -- Josh Lambert was possessed by an evil ghost who had been stalking him since childhood. And it murdered Elise.And as the subtitle suggests, &#34;Insidious Chapter 2&#34; is less a sequel and more a continuation of the story that was left unfinished. The first movie was a bit like a modern version of &#34;Poltergeist,&#34; but this one is more of a supernatural version of &#34;Psycho&#34; -- and while chillingly spooky, it leaves a number of loose threads hanging that are never really addressed. Come on, where is Darth Maul demon?Many years ago, Josh Lambert was haunted by a spirit, and Elise was called in to somehow deal with the situation. Now the police are investigating her murder, and Renai (Rose Byrne) is trying to get back into normal life now that her son has been returned to her. But weird things keep happening around her, including the piano and/or baby toys playing by themselves, and more weird visions of a creepy white-clad woman.And Josh (Patrick Wilson) seems strangely unconcerned about what's going on -- possibly because he's not actually Josh. And, well, because he's hearing voices commanding him to kill the Lambert family in order to stay alive.Meanwhile, Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) suspects that something supernatural is still up, so she accompanies Specs and Tucker (Leigh Whannell and Angus Sampson) as they try to contact Elise. Thanks to a dice-using medium named Carl (Steve Coulter), they head to a hospital where Lorraine used to work -- and they soon discover that a bizarre ICU case many years ago may be connected to the current supernatural events. But to save Josh -- and stop a crazed serial killer ghost -- someone will have to venture into the Further again.&#34;Insidious Chapter 2&#34; is pretty appropriately named, as it forms a complete self-contained story with the first &#34;Insidious.&#34; This time around, James Wan abandons the throw-in-everything-creepy-I-can-think-of approach in favor of a more focused plot about hidden dead bodies, a ghostly killer, and his creepy grinning psychotic mother who controls him even in death. Think an even more sexually-screwed-up version of &#34;Psycho,&#34; but with ghosts.That, ironically, is the movie's biggest weak point. The movie is not a sequel, but a second part -- and yet there are big aspects of the first movie that go unaddressed. For instance, the Darth Maul demon is left completely unaddressed, even though Dalton ventures back into the grotesque shadow-world of the Further -- you would expect it to be waiting for him. It feels like James Wan selected certain supernatural bits of &#34;Insidious&#34; and sculpted a narrative around them.However, Wan has lost none of his skill in creating creaking, eerie, pale-lit atmosphere, and slowly sinking his audience into a quagmire of nightmarishness. However, there's a bit more investigative mystery in this one, with Lorraine and Elise's sidekicks investigating the source of the current spookery -- murder, castration and a hidden room filled with corpses.But a lot of the spookiness also relies on Patrick Wilson, who gives a very nice, subtle performance as Not-Josh for most of the movie -- there's nothing OBVIOUSLY wrong with him, but the chilly flatness when he speaks about anything serious is a dead giveaway. But he also depicts the crazy creepy killer during a bathroom scene where Not-Josh weeps and whines at his undead mommy as she commands him to kill the Lambert family.Rose Byrne is basically doing the same thing as in &#34;Insidious&#34;: wandering around witnessing spooky stuff, and gradually figuring out what's going on. So much of the plot relies on Hershey and Ty Simpkins, who provide solid performances as a strong-willed matriarch and a boy who discovers that he can use the powers that endangered him to help his father. And while Lin Shaye's character is dead, she's not gone -- and she's still a powerful, charismatic presence.&#34;Insidious: Chapter 2&#34; suffers from some dangling plot threads, but it is still creepy and bizarre, with an excellent performance by the underrated Patrick Wilson.

Most people rightfully go into sequels with low expectations. They'll be happy to know that the bar has once again been raised by this thrilling follow-up to the highly successful 2011 haunted house spectacular.The Lambert family moves into Josh's childhood house to escape the supernatural powers which manifested themselves in their own home. It doesn't take long to realize that whatever Josh (Patrick Wilson) brought back with him from the spirit world has followed them. The family must come together to uncover the dark secrets of the past and put an end to the otherworldly reign of terror they've been subjected to.Director James Wan and writer Leigh Whannell fabricate a disturbing and complex tale that perfectly extends the story started with the first &#34;Insidious.&#34; They've crafted something that stays with you rather than just being a short-term influence on the viewer. I walked away from it thinking I was fairly safe from any after-effects. It wasn't until I slipped into bed, fell asleep, and started having nightmares that I began to comprehend the sort of long-term influence &#34;Insidious: Chapter 2&#34; had on me.The DVD version of &#34;Insidious: Chapter 2&#34; contains a couple special features. It includes two featurettes entitled &#34;Peripheral Visions: Behind the Scenes&#34; and &#34;Ghostly Transformations.&#34; They concentrate on the making of the film and highlight the makeup process for the ghouls and ghosts.&#34;Insidious: Chapter 2&#34; is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of terror and violence, and thematic elements. It's a straight-shooting supernatural horror film with no detours into adult situations or nudity. I wish more genre movies would borrow from this playbook.If you look at &#34;Insidious: Chapter 2&#34; from the point of view of a Christian, it might not be for you. It features astral projection and communication with the dead. The afterlife begins with a pit-stop of sorts that seems to be purgatory. However, it's not a nice place as reflected in its dark and shadowy atmosphere. If you can look past these different elements and just enjoy a creepy flick for what it is, this is guaranteed to satisfy.&#34;Insidious: Chapter 2&#34; starts off a little rough because of its awkward editing.

1631523,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00BEIYOHC,FNDNreview,"[6, 10]","The horror genre is currently in a state of heightened popularity - and one of the men responsible is James Wan.  For those that don't know his name, he is one of the creators and directors of the horror saga, Saw - which introduced the Jigsaw killer, a mysterious vigilante that tested the will of his victims through various methods of torture.  While the Saw franchise wasn't exactly a critic's delight, the series went on to become the highest grossing horror film franchise of all-time.  After exiting the Saw franchise, Wan went on to direct two more popular horror flicks - Insidious in 2011 and The Conjuring in the summer of 2013.  With the massive success of Insidious (grossing nearly $100 million on a measly budget of $1.5 million), a sequel was quickly predicted, which is also written and directed by Wan - titled Insidious: Chapter 2.The horror sequel, Insidious: Chapter 2, picks up right where its predecessor left off - focusing on Josh Lambert (Patrick Wilson), his wife, Renai (Rose Bryne), and their son, Dalton (Ty Simpkins).  Just when they get their son back and assume their lives can return to normalcy, Renai and her mother-in-law, Lorraine (Barbara Hershey), continue to see ghosts in their home.  With the death of Elise (Lin Shaye) and Josh acting peculiar, the family enlists the help of Carl (Steve Coulter), a former friend of Elise that attempts to discover the identity of the ghosts and also who is responsible for her murder.  Leigh Whannell, Angus Sampons, and Jocelin Donahue also star in supporting roles.The Insidious films are just two films on an ever-growing list of horror flicks that stick to the generic, yet oddly popular supernatural haunted house gimmick.  It would appear the days of the slasher killer have gone by the wayside (a trend that will no doubt return with full force one day), giving way to stories about families living in houses with creaky doors, uninvited ghosts, and children with bad dreams.  You'd think this style of storytelling would have grown tiresome long, long ago, but the majority of the modern horror genre heavily resembles films similar to Insidious.  Even James Wan's previous endeavor, The Conjuring, deals with supernatural ghouls invading the home of an innocent family.  And, although these films all resemble one another - they work.  The stories are interesting, creepy, and have propelled the horror genre to unimaginable, unpredictable heights - a trend that will continue with the success of Insidious: Chapter 2.We all know that sequels carry more criticism than the originals, due to their long history of being inferior in comparison.  Sure, we can always find a few exceptions to the rule, but more often than not - sequels simply act as desperate attempts to cash in on a massive wave of success.  This Insidious sequel is guilty of being both inferior to its predecessor and riding the wave of success.  However, this film needed to be made and that's saying something that doesn't usually need to be said about most sequels.  Insidious: Chapter 2 is a must see for anyone that enjoyed the first film, mostly because it does a better job of telling a meaningful story.  The first film, for all its successes, lacked closure for characters that were undeniably enjoyable.  Thankfully, this second film wraps up the story of the Lambert family with a big red ribbon, and even makes plans for the future of the franchise.This is one of those reviews where even the simplest comment can give away big pieces of the story, so there's no need to go into too much detail other than to say Josh is definitely possessed - which was made abundantly clear at the end of the first film.  From there, this story explains who the ghosts are that continuously haunt the family in their waking hours and in their dreams.  And, even though the story gets a little too carried away with itself as the major plot secrets are revealed, it all works out very well in the end.  This story incorporates a weird time travel element that really makes absolutely no sense, but the way in which it's used is cleverly constructed - thus making a fully explained story out of both films, which now act as one complete circle of events.  James Wan even goes the full length to show reconstructed scenes from the first film that was left unexplained, like the scene where Josh hears a knock at the front door, which will clearly explain what was mysteriously setting off the home security system.While the child, Dalton, was the center of attention in the first film, the father - Josh, is now the central character that's in need of rescuing.  This is exciting news for fans of Patrick Wilson, who absolutely shines in this role of protagonist and antagonist.  There's a certain mysterious attraction to his style that makes him a pleasant addition to horror flicks - which he's been thriving in after starring in Insidious, The Conjuring, and now Insidious: Chapter 2.  However, if the story follows the course laid out in the closing moments of this film, it would appear Wilson may be done with the Insidious franchise, which will undoubtedly spawn at least one more sequel - and likely even more than that.  Still, it might in fact be the supporting cast, which includes Saw and Insidious co-creator Leigh Whannell, that (minor spoiler) carries this franchise into the second sequel.Overall, Insidious is nothing more than an average addition to the horror genre.  It's certainly not the scariest movie you'll ever see, and definitely not as scary as the first film, but it manages to fulfill its duty of making people squirm in their seats every few minutes.  The bottom line here is that this particular film will have more significance to the fans of the first film - since it picks up right where that story lives off.  While the first flick could have stood on its own merit, this sequel serves as a prequel and sequel all in one, providing origin stories for several characters, all while progressing the overall vastness of the Insidious experience.  The film can be overzealous at times, but in the end, it all works itself out in a way that will appease horror fans and also create a moderate amount of buzz for the next sequel.  Much like the Saw franchise, it would appear that this franchise will carry on, only with a new set of victims set to replace the Lambert family (and no that doesn't necessarily mean they die).GRADE:

1631524,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,B00BEIYOHC,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[0, 0]","On some levels, this film is a pretty decent sequel of Insidious in that it begins basically where the first one left off and much of the plot is derived directly from the first film. Also, in many respects, the actors do a solid job in the film and there is a sense of foreboding and mystery surrounding certain plot elements. However, as it is with sequels, this one is not quite as good as the original film and fails to be as engaging. I think that the first one, while not totally an original concept, kept us quite &#8220;in the dark&#8221; as to the many spooks, scares and twists.Insidious 2 does have some moments of intense mood and atmosphere. In fact, this is one of James Wan&#8217;s biggest strengths as a director, he shows rather than tells, and never uses &#8220;gore&#8221; as a substitute for true horror. Horror directors could take a clue from him: he, for the  most part, tries to steer away from horror film ploys, and basic lame scary clich&eacute;s. However, there are moments where this rule is broken and we can see the scare a mile away (the door slowly creaking and opening as the strange mist and smoke emits from underneath&#8230;.). There are moments of implied gore, which happens off screen.Probably the biggest problem with this &#8220;chapter&#8221; of Insidious is that the plot gets way, way too silly and convoluted, to the point where we basically know they are setting up the third installment of the film. It&#8217;s not bad as long as the film doesn&#8217;t waver off into the usual sequel awfulness, but let&#8217;s hope it doesn&#8217;t. Still, Insidious 2 isn&#8217;t a bad horror film per se.

The character of Parker is deeply pathetic and I was feeling sorry for his predicament and for his short time of happiness with his new family.  It was inevitable that his mother would destroy any sense of comfort or joy for him, but did Wan have to portray him so unsympathetically?  He might as well as had him storm through the cellar door shrieking, &#34;Heeere's Johnnie!&#34;  I understand what kind of movies Wan makes and they are never about just one character, they are about the movie as a whole, the characters are always 2 dimensional and secondary to the thrills and shocks that are the main event of his films.  Perhaps witih a different director and maybe with a better script, a better movie could have been made about the character of Parker, about his child abuse, life after death and his second chance to get it right.  I liked Patrick Wilson's depiction of Parker as really trying, playing games with the children, albeit awkwardly, but trying all the same.  It's a shame his portrayal had to be reduced to just another maniac busting down doors and terrorizing women and children, like we have seen a thousand times already.

With the digital camera, she takes a picture of Josh. He did not like the flash and becomes angry at Elise for taking the picture. He strangles Elise to death. Renai (Rose Byrne) enters the room and finds Elise dead. Josh has disappeared. She looks into the camera screen and is scared. Suddenly a voice from behind her says, ""turn around"". Josh touches her. She turns around and what she sees scares her.This second movie begins with what happened in 1986. Elise (Lindsay Seim) arrives at the home of Lorraine Lambert (Jocelin Donahue) by the request of Carl (Hank Harris), a ghost hunter.  Elise and Carl have worked together before. Elise questions the young boy, Josh (Garrett Ryan). She needs to know who the ghost is. It is a she. While Josh is concentrating with his eyes closed, Elise carefully walks about the house. Josh tells her if she is hot or cold as Carl holds the baby monitor. She enters the children's bedroom. A light fades on by itself. Josh becomes a emotional and tells her ""hotter"". The closet door has opened.That is all I will tell you. You will have to see the movie to find out the rest.Now the present story begins from the ending of the first movie. The Lamberts go to Lorraine's (Barbara Hershey) house while Specs (Leigh Whannell) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) are in Josh and Renai's house alone.

It also manages to link together with the first movie as well and expands on the Further and who was that old lady ghost at the end of the first movie.SPOILER: We also get the return of Elise, which was one of my favorite characters from the first movie.Some negatives:There's a scene here where Josh's mom and the ghost hunters from the first movie walk around an abandoned hospital and it feels long and kind of drags out.  Another thing to point out is that this movie does repeat things we already saw in the first film. Like instead of Josh saving Dalton, Dalton now needs to save Josh, but I'm just nitpicking.If you enjoyed the first movie, you'll most likely enjoy the sequel.

This is how the story goes: The horror team of director James Wan and writer/co-star Leigh Whannell reunite with the original cast of Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Lin Shaye, Barbara Hershey and Ty Simpkins in INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2, a sequel to the acclaimed horror film, which follows the haunted Lambert family as they seek to uncover the mysterious childhood secret that has left them dangerously connected to the spirit world.The cast led by Patrick Wilson (as Josh) & Rose Byrne (as Renai) is great. The directing by James Wan (also did the story) is great. The story by Wan & Leigh Whannell (also played the role of Specs) & screenplay by Whannell is great.The music by Joseph Bishara is great. The cinematography by John R. Leonetti is great. The film editing by Kirk M. Morri is great. The casting by Anne McCarthy & Kellie Roy is great. The production design by Jennifer Spence is great. The art direction by Jason Garner is great. The set decoration by Lori Mazuer, set dressings by Daniel Vazquez & Nic Weethee is great. The costume design by Kristin M. Burke is great. The visual effects supervised by Ray McIntyre Jr. is great. The special make-up effects by Liz Briseno, Steve Costanza, Mark Garbarino & Kelly Golden is great. The stunts coordinated by Joel Kramer is great.This is a great, well-made and well-done horror movie sequel that is entertaining and intriguing. It is also, a well-crafted scary horror movie, as well. This is another great hit from James Wan (continuing his roll of hit horror movies starting with Insidious & The Conjuring), as well as, Leigh Whannell.

1631576,A2EZBKKBVLNXQ4,B00BEIYOHC,kyldh,"[0, 0]","I thought it was a pretty good movie. They tied it into the first film in pretty creative ways... it was pretty creepy at times too. I really can't complain about anything other than the flashback when they dubbed Lin Shaye (Elise)'s voice over the actress playing young Lin Shaye. You see a young 25-30 year old woman but hear the voice of woman who is 70... doesn't sound very natural (or believable) plus her lips don't completely match up the entire time. Also, I'm not sure if it was fake or not, but the guy playing young Steve Coulter(Carl) had an extremely fake-looking beard. Like... so fake that it looks like part of a cheesy Halloween costume.I had 100% expected to find out that this was a &#34;movie within a movie&#34; type of thing. Like in the &#34;Scream&#34; sequels when they where filming the movie &#34;Stab&#34;, based on the character's story from &#34;Scream.&#34; When I slowly started to realize that this was NOT the case and the director had expected us to overlook how terrible of a job they did on this portion of the film...

1631578,A1CDZNPO7U4E6N,B00BEIYOHC,LadyLestat,"[89, 97]","First of all, let me just say that The Conjuring, Insidious, and Insidious Chapter 2 are all very effective and well-done horror movies. James Wan is on a roll, and honestly, so is Patrick Wilson because he is the common denominator in all 3 of these movies. Quite frankly, in my opinion, it is thanks to these movies that have successfully breathed life back into the horror genre. This is refreshing after sitting around for the last decade and a half watching campy, slasher, gory, and extremely bloody so-called scary movies that have left me nothing but disappointed and anything but scared. I was wondering when Hollywood was going to realize that tons of blood splatter is just like any other over-used effect; there's nothing really that special about it. I'm not sitting on the edge of my seat wondering what's going to happen next if I can already expect a masked killer, a home invasion, tons of teen sex and drug use, contraptions of torture, or a documentary-style horror film that looks like someone just grabbed a video camera, took it into a dark backyard or the woods, cut on the night-vision, and relied on heavy breathing and running away from unseen forces to move the audience. All of that is lazy, mundane, and it shows lack of creativity as well as originality. I am sick to death of that crap. As a horror movie buff, I thought it was virtually impossible to make a scary movie these days, or at least try to make a movie that pushes the envelope a little bit...dare to be different if you will! I know there isn't much that many of us can say we haven't seen before, but how it's executed is what's important in my book.This movie starts right at the end of the first one (smart move). The audience is thrust right back into the evil that is STILL following the Lamberts from the first film (another smart move). If you want to keep me interested in something; please don't ignore the film's predecessors just to make money. Those films still have merit, and have laid the foundation for what comes next. Anyway, it's clear that there's still a murder to be solved (another smart move), and there's something seriously off about Josh. The film also includes more interaction with the Lambert children this time around. The dead spirits are more aggressive, so it's clear they aren't there to mess around.This movie also didn't drag around for the first 40 minutes like the first film did. However, what I loved most about this movie is that it answers all your questions about the previous film (gigantic smart move). Nothing from the first movie is what it seems. I'm so glad this movie didn't start off with an entirely different entity before they expounded on what the first one was in its entirety. I wanted to know the story. I had already figured out the ending from the first film that some overlooked because they were so focused on the music and the look of the red-faced demon. The fact of the matter is that the target never was the little boy; the target was the dad all along. The child was just being held hostage and used to lure the dad back into the Further so the dead spirit that almost had him while he was a child could successfully take his body which was originally intended. The boy was the bait. Don't get me wrong, the red-faced demon with the hooves was going to take the boy's body too; he just wasn't the primary focus. Red face was just ensuring Dalton stayed out long enough to be possessed as well. I don't think some people got that; it was a win/win situation for both entities who wished to live again. Knowing that, it all makes perfect sense.I don't want to give too much of this movie away, but you will be surprised to see what this thing is that has been following Josh since his childhood which just shows how tenacious and persistent these entities can be. It also gives you more insight into how deep Josh's gift of astral projection really runs. Josh and Dalton's out-of-body experiences play an interesting role in this movie, and adds something a little different into the mix instead of a typical family battling the paranormal. I appreciate that! Dalton proves to be quite useful and clever in this one, and he handles his gift like a seasoned pro. I had to mention Ty Simpkins because he did great in both films.This movie is just like The Conjuring in the sense that there is something for everybody and it plays on your worst fears:Afraid of the closet...check!Afraid of the dark...check!Afraid of the things that go bump in the night...check!Afraid of ghosts, possession, and dead demonic spirits...check!Afraid of harm coming to your children...check!Afraid of being a prisoner in your own body and your home...check!My suggestion is that you have to see this movie at least once.",5,Awesome!,1379116800,"09 14,

1631586,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00BEIYOHC,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","There are few directors who can make a truly scary movie. I'm not talking about the run of the mill movie where something jumps at the camera, the music screeches and you feel that instant adrenalin rush from what happened. I'm talking about a scary movie that has a few of those moments perhaps but that has something deeper about it that makes you walk out of a theater or turn off the DVD player and wonder if something terrifying from the screen didn't walk off and stay by your side. James Wan is a director whose name you might not know but who makes movies exactly like that.Wan first came to notice when he co-wrote and directed a small low budget film you may have heard of called SAW. Things he did in that movie, his creative use of light and shadow, of wringing a story to get everything out of it, can be found in the other films he's done in follow up. In 2010 he made another horror film called INSIDIOUS. The story of a haunting that wasn't of a house but of a boy was a hit with movie fans that made it a successful release. It ended with the boy and his father leaving the Further, a not quite limbo between the worlds it the living and the dead, and returning home safe and sound. Or did they?INSIDIOUS 2 comes out on DVD this week to answer that question. Picking up immediately where the first film ended, Josh and Renai Lambert (Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne) stay at his mother's house since their old house is now a crime scene with the death of Elise Rainier (Lynn Shaye), the spiritual investigator that helped rescue them. Within minutes of trying to go to bed things begin to happen. Renai is the first to realize that it hasn't ended yet.In the first moments of this movie we see the past and discover that it wasn't the first time Elise had a meeting with Josh. As a child she was there to help as well. Under hypnosis she finds out what she needs to know about the haunting and thinks that using the hypnosis she can erase the knowledge of the Further from Josh's mind forever. Alas this isn't the case.As things begin to happen in Josh's mother Lorraine's (Barbara Hershey) house, Renai is frightened once more for her family. But this time she also has a fear of Josh as well. While he may have rescued their son and brought him back from the dark place he went to, he seems somehow different. The police suspecting him of being the one that killed Elise doesn't ease her mind any.As Lorraine begins to see ghostly figures in her home she and Renai begin to attack the problem from different angles, neither knowing at first what the other is doing. Lorraine approaches Carl, Elise's assistant from year's back who brought her into the case. Renai on the other hand approaches Elise's assistants Specs and Tucker. Eventually their pursuits cross paths and the trio teams up to help this family.I won't give away the details of the reveal here but the fact is they give it away early on, as a matter of fact with Renai's fear that Josh isn't the man he was. Suffice to say that the bride in black from the first film hasn't gone off to her just desserts yet. As a matter of fact just who the bride is is revealed more here than in the first film. The jump scares aren't as many here but the depth of story is more fleshed out and when it is revealed it's a much creepier concept than originally brought out.The actors do a wonderful job here with not one taking center stage. That's a tough job when there are 2 to 3 name actors who normally would dominate the film. Instead this feels more like an ensemble piece where each has a role to play in the telling of this story. The stand out character in this film is more the lighting and camera work on display. Both flesh out the tale more than the words and acting. This isn't denigrating the actor's performances, just noting that everything from start to finish is enhanced by the use of light and shadow.It may seem odd for this to be the top release coming out the week of Christmas to DVD but horror films seem to be more widespread these days than ever before. The good news is that this one seems to fulfill every need that horror and suspense fans will love. That means that not only is this one worth watching but one to add to the collection as well. It's that good.",5,BRIDE IN BLACK RETURNS,1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,4258,"['are', 'few', 'directors', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'truly', 'scary', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'run', 'mill', 'movie', 'where', 'something', 'jumps', 'camera', 'music', 'screeches', 'feel', 'instant', 'adrenalin', 'rush', 'what', 'happened', ""'m"", 'talking', 'scary', 'movie', 'few', 'moments', 'perhaps', 'something', 'deeper', 'walk', 'theater', 'turn', 'off', 'DVD', 'player', 'wonder', 'something', 'terrifying', 'screen', 'did', ""n't"", 'walk', 'off', 'stay', 'side', 'James', 'Wan', 'director', 'name', 'might', 'not', 'know', 'who', 'movies', 'exactly', 'that.Wan', 'first', 'came', 'notice', 'when', 'co-wrote', 'directed', 'small', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'heard', 'called', 'SAW', 'did', 'movie', 'creative', 'use', 'light', 'shadow', 'wringing', 'story', 'get', 'everything', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'other', 'films', 'done', 'follow', 'up', '2010', 'made', 'horror', 'film', 'called', 'INSIDIOUS', 'story', 'haunting', 'was', ""n't"", 'house', 'boy', 'was', 'hit', 'movie', 'fans', 'made', 'successful', 'release', 'ended', 'boy', 'father', 'leaving', 'Further', 'not', 'quite', 'limbo', 'worlds', 'living', 'dead', 'returning', 'home', 'safe', 'sound', 'did', 'INSIDIOUS', '2', 'out', 'DVD', 'week', 'answer', 'question', 'Picking', 'up', 'immediately', 'where', 'first', 'film', 'ended', 'Josh', 'Renai', 'Lambert', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'stay', 'mother', 'house', 'old', 'house', 'now', 'crime', 'scene', 'death', 'Elise', 'Rainier', 'Lynn', 'Shaye', 'spiritual', 'investigator', 'helped', 'rescue', 'minutes', 'trying', 'go', 'bed', 'things', 'begin', 'happen', 'Renai', 'first', 'realize', ""n't"", 'ended', 'yet.In', 'first', 'moments', 'movie', 'see', 'past', 'discover', 'was', ""n't"", 'first', 'time', 'Elise', 'had', 'meeting', 'Josh', 'child', 'was', 'there', 'help', 'as', 'well', 'hypnosis', 'out', 'what', 'know', 'haunting', 'using', 'hypnosis', 'can', 'erase', 'knowledge', 'Further', 'Josh', 'mind', 'forever', 'Alas', ""n't"", 'case.As', 'things', 'begin', 'happen', 'Josh', 'mother', 'Lorraine', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'house', 'Renai', 'frightened', 'once', 'more', 'family', 'time', 'also', 'fear', 'Josh', 'well', 'may', 'have', 'rescued', 'son', 'brought', 'back', 'dark', 'place', 'went', 'somehow', 'different', 'police', 'suspecting', 'being', 'one', 'killed', 'Elise', ""n't"", 'ease', 'mind', 'any.As', 'Lorraine', 'see', 'ghostly', 'figures', 'home', 'Renai', 'begin', 'attack', 'problem', 'different', 'angles', 'knowing', 'first', 'what', 'other', 'doing', 'Lorraine', 'Carl', 'Elise', 'assistant', 'year', 'back', 'who', 'brought', 'case', 'Renai', 'other', 'hand', 'approaches', 'Elise', 'assistants', 'Specs', 'Tucker', 'Eventually', 'pursuits', 'cross', 'paths', 'trio', 'up', 'help', 'family.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'details', 'reveal', 'here', 'fact', 'give', 'away', 'early', 'matter', 'fact', 'Renai', 'fear', 'Josh', ""n't"", 'man', 'was', 'Suffice', 'say', 'bride', 'black', 'first', 'film', ""n't"", 'gone', 'off', 'just', 'desserts', 'yet', 'matter', 'fact', 'just', 'who', 'bride', 'revealed', 'more', 'here', 'first', 'film', 'jump', 'scares', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'here', 'depth', 'story', 'more', 'fleshed', 'out', 'when', 'revealed', 'much', 'creepier', 'concept', 'originally', 'brought', 'out.The', 'actors', 'do', 'wonderful', 'job', 'here', 'not', 'one', 'taking', 'center', 'stage', 'tough', 'job', 'when', 'are', '2', '3', 'name', 'actors', 'who', 'normally', 'would', 'dominate', 'film', 'Instead', 'more', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'where', 'role', 'play', 'telling', 'story', 'stand', 'out', 'character', 'film', 'more', 'lighting', 'camera', 'work', 'display', 'flesh', 'out', 'tale', 'more', 'words', 'acting', ""n't"", 'denigrating', 'actor', 'performances', 'just', 'noting', 'everything', 'start', 'finish', 'enhanced', 'use', 'light', 'shadow.It', 'may', 'seem', 'odd', 'be', 'top', 'release', 'coming', 'out', 'week', 'Christmas', 'DVD', 'horror', 'films', 'seem', 'be', 'more', 'widespread', 'days', 'ever', 'good', 'news', 'one', 'fulfill', 'need', 'horror', 'suspense', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'worth', 'watching', 'one', 'add', 'collection', 'as', 'well', 'good']",N/A

It is also the perfect example of why a good movie depends on more than a good director.I can't really talk about the plot of this movie without giving away spoilers from either this movie or the previous one, since it's basically a continuation of the paranormal terrorism faced by the Lambert family. Basically, there is a woman in white, and a woman in black, each stalking the boundaries between life and death, and each with sinister intentions towards one member or another of the family. With the help of detectives, psychics, and paranormal investigators, the mother and father (who may or may not be possessed) try to solve the deadly mysteries that follow them.Director James Wan has the strange honor of directing both the best horror film of the year, ""Insidious Chapter 2"" and the worst horror film of the year, ""The Conjuring"". I've always liked Wan's style - there is a kind of hyper-real theatricality to his filmmaking, and there is kind of a trademark visual style that he uses in all his films. But what separates ""The Conjuring"" from ""Insidious"" is the writing.""The Conjuring"" was written by guys that wrote episodes of the ""Baywatch Nights"" TV show, as well as the Paris Hilton horror movie ""House of Wax"". The ""Insidious"" movies are written by Leigh Wannell, who also wrote several of the ""Saw"" movies. Now, you can say what you want about the damage to society inflicted by the torture-porn genre, but the screenplays of the ""Saw"" films were cleverly written to loop back and forth on each other, making a sort of meta-puzzle that could only be clearly seen from a distance above them all. Whannell does the same thing here. Some puzzling events from the first ""Insidious"" movie (that I thought were plot holes) are explained here. You can't really appreciate what this movie does if you don't remember the first one.Sure, ""Insidious"" covers similar territory to every other horror movie of the past 40 years (and who are we kidding, the Lambert family is just an updated version of the Freeling family from ""Poltergeist""), but Whannell and Wan do pull some new things out of the bag. Instead of slamming the audience through 90 minutes of random non-stop funhouse scares (like ""The Conjuring""), Whannell is willing to let the story marinate for awhile, requiring some actual brain activity and memory recall from the audience. You don't have to understand ""The Conjuring"" to experience the fright scenes (mostly because there is nothing to understand), but some of the impact of ""Insidious"" only comes when you put the pieces together yourself.The movie is rated PG-13 because there is no gore.

1631606,A1K6K23WG0IBWE,B00BEIYOHC,Quadro Sinead Summer,"[5, 6]","Insidious and The Conjuring are in my assessment two of the best horror films to come along in quite some time,.In fact The Conjuring might very well be one of the 10 best horror films ever made. It had me feeling convinced that James Wan may very well be the new master of horror, it's that good in my opinion. 'Saw' was not everyone's cup of tea, but for a directorial debut it was a very impressive first outing. Insidious is generally considered to be a very good if not -superb horror movie.The vast majority of viewers considered it one of the better horror movies they had seen in awhile, I know I did. It had plenty of good freights, lots of truly horrific moments, plenty of creepy chills, and everything we always hope for but never quite get in most horror movies that have come along this past 20 years.I'm convinced The Conjuring is perhaps the third best Horror movie since the Exorcist and perhaps the Shining. I can't think of one better except those. If someone can think of one let me know. But what happened here with Insidious II? It felt totally derivative and predictable of a lot of poorly written and poorly executed horror film sequels. Since Wan is in charge you should expect more mastery, craftsmanship, originality and a carefully constructed script and execution. Instead what I see here is a cheap shot script that simply doesn't have the unique and intelligent qualities that chapter one did- Saw or The Conjuring. It instead  seems to swerve into lazy scripted ideas and less than magical movie making this time. It's not as if Insidious Ch. 1 doesn't have a few little weaknesses, it does, but they are hard to notice. This reminds me of too many first efforts that had mediocre part II's. A good example is actually The Exorcist, Exorcist II, which was a disaster, and Exorcist III, which was not as bad as II but nowhere near as good as I. In my opinion Wan's Insidious ch. II is in about the same territory as Blatty's Exorcist III. Pretty good, but basically an average horror movie. Insidious was a way above average horror film, and Conjuring is I think as close to a horror masterpiece as I have ever seen. So with that kind of opinion about Wan's most recent films, you'd have to wonder why I was not all that impressed with Insidious II. Speaking simply, it's just an average horror film that is fine on it's own merits but simply does not live up at all to the original. Not an epic fail at all, but an epic fail for a master film maker like James Wan.",2,"A new master of horror, but..uhhh what happened this time Mr. Wan?",1388793600,"01 4, 2014",2014,2496,"['Insidious', 'Conjuring', 'are', 'assessment', 'two', 'best', 'horror', 'films', 'come', 'along', 'quite', 'time', '.In', 'fact', 'Conjuring', 'might', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'one', '10', 'best', 'horror', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'had', 'feeling', 'convinced', 'James', 'Wan', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'new', 'master', 'horror', 'good', 'opinion', 'was', 'not', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'directorial', 'debut', 'was', 'very', 'impressive', 'first', 'outing', 'Insidious', 'generally', 'considered', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'not', '-superb', 'horror', 'movie.The', 'vast', 'majority', 'viewers', 'considered', 'one', 'better', 'horror', 'movies', 'had', 'seen', 'awhile', 'know', 'did', 'had', 'plenty', 'good', 'freights', 'lots', 'truly', 'horrific', 'moments', 'plenty', 'creepy', 'chills', 'everything', 'always', 'hope', 'never', 'quite', 'get', 'most', 'horror', 'movies', 'have', 'come', 'past', '20', 'years.I', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'Conjuring', 'perhaps', 'third', 'best', 'Horror', 'movie', 'Exorcist', 'perhaps', 'Shining', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'one', 'better', 'someone', 'can', 'think', 'one', 'let', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'here', 'Insidious', 'II', 'felt', 'totally', 'derivative', 'predictable', 'lot', 'poorly', 'written', 'poorly', 'executed', 'horror', 'film', 'sequels', 'Wan', 'charge', 'should', 'expect', 'more', 'mastery', 'craftsmanship', 'originality', 'carefully', 'constructed', 'script', 'execution', 'Instead', 'what', 'see', 'here', 'cheap', 'shot', 'script', 'simply', ""n't"", 'have', 'unique', 'intelligent', 'qualities', 'chapter', 'one', 'did-', 'Saw', 'Conjuring', 'instead', 'swerve', 'lazy', 'scripted', 'ideas', 'less', 'magical', 'movie', 'making', 'time', 'not', 'Insidious', 'Ch', '1', ""n't"", 'have', 'few', 'little', 'weaknesses', 'are', 'hard', 'notice', 'too', 'many', 'first', 'efforts', 'had', 'mediocre', 'part', 'II', 'good', 'example', 'actually', 'Exorcist', 'Exorcist', 'II', 'was', 'disaster', 'Exorcist', 'III', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'II', 'nowhere', 'as', 'good', 'opinion', 'Wan', 'Insidious', 'ch', 'II', 'same', 'territory', 'Blatty', 'Exorcist', 'III', 'Pretty', 'good', 'basically', 'average', 'horror', 'movie', 'Insidious', 'was', 'way', 'average', 'horror', 'film', 'Conjuring', 'think', 'close', 'horror', 'masterpiece', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'So', 'kind', 'opinion', 'Wan', 'most', 'recent', 'films', ""'d"", 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'Insidious', 'II', 'Speaking', 'simply', 'just', 'average', 'horror', 'film', 'fine', 'own', 'merits', 'simply', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'original', 'Not', 'epic', 'fail', 'epic', 'fail', 'master', 'film', 'maker', 'James', 'Wan']",N/A

Zwick,"[0, 0]","***1/2Haunted house movies have become so similar and generic in their content and style, that's it's getting harder and harder to tell a good one from a bad one these days. &#34;Insidious Chapter 2&#34; strikes me as a fairly good one - at least up to a point. It's not that there's anything particularly groundbreaking or new about it; it's just that the level of filmmaking is a notch or two above what one frequently finds in the genre.Written by Leigh Wannell and directed by James Wan, &#34;Insidious Chapter 2&#34; follows the standard blueprint for films in this genre: a couple with young children finds itself bedeviled by restless spirits in an old Victorian house that, just from the looks of it, practically screams &#34;Haunted.&#34; We're already familiar with most of the characters from the original &#34;Insidious,&#34; including Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson as the distraught parents and &#34;Entity&#34; star Barbara Hershey as the grandmother. There's the usual calling in of ghost-hunters and the standard mumbo-jumbo about &#34;the other side,&#34; but at least &#34;Insidious Chapter 2&#34; goes that extra step by actually entering into that alternate world and confronting the spirits residing therein.&#34;Insidious Chapter 2&#34; is a bit too derivative of &#34;The Shining&#34; in the dad's seeming descent into madness and possession and his posing a threat to the safety of his family (a baseball bat and a fire extinguisher have replaced the ax in the earlier picture as the weapon of choice here). And even though the movie wanders off into some pretty goofy territory in its second half, the excellent cinematography, imagery and sound effects manage to keep the fright meter in the red zone for most of the duration.And credit those who made the film for having the good taste to include a brief clip of Herk Harvey's seminal 1962 classic &#34;Carnival of Souls,&#34; one of the creepiest horror films of all time, playing on a TV nearby.

1631619,A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z,B00BEIYOHC,"Santeria ""Son of Tazz""","[30, 33]","[I bought the combo and here is my review]I really hesitate to call this totally original film a franchise. James Wan creates a film that is a superb experience in the cinema, and is brilliant on the Blu-ray delivery in all respects. Thankfully, it is not a sequel in the traditional sense, and delivers the scares with both barrels. I would expect that you probably know the story by now, if not, you should see INSIDIOUS first and then come back to INSIDIOUS CHAPTER 2. This film starts with scares right from the beginning, and takes you on a tremendous roller coaster ride with the original cast.The extras on Blu-ray are brilliant again. The work in progress: onset Q&A; deals with story issues and last 23 minutes. Peripheral vision: behind-the-scenes is a great bonus and last 15 minutes. Insidious: spectral sightings are supposed to be web-i-sodes, which I hope is self-explanatory, but if you have not seen it this is next level freaky, even from the point of view of INSIDIOUS CHAPTER 2, mainly because it is so intense and in a few short minutes Lynn Shaye delivers more of a power packed punch than she does in the main film. I think that if you enjoy insidious chapter 2, then insidious spectral sightings is going to be something you love. The extra HAUNTED HOSPITAL: ON LOCATION is kind of so-so but one item in it may give you a spine tingling fright. GHOSTLY TRANSFORMATIONS is about the makeup and is intriguing but would've been better in a wider documentary. Leigh Whannell's Journal is actually quite enjoyable but at eight minutes it is way too short. Overall, whilst I would've liked a commentary in the bonus, I think that what we have at the moment is pretty fun. I hope you enjoy this roller coaster ride as much as I did, or even more; I know I'll be watching it a few more times the volume up and the lights turned down... Pleasant dreams.********************************************************I rarely write a review of the films before the DVD or Blu-ray is out. I had no expectations of what the sequel would bring to the party. After seeing the promo I was won over. Anyone who has seen the promo/s will have an idea of what I mean. The one thing I do agree on is that any comment on this story would give away too much, but not to mention by word-of-mouth that this is a great supernatural horror film would be a disservice. As many horror films as I have seen,I sometimes think I am a little jaded, or even more accepting of the spook type of films. Lucky for me I had about 15 young people sitting in the row behind me, and every time I got spooked, they screemed or more, and this was a good barometer. For a truly scary film this one touches all bases, and if James Wan is leaving horror, then that is a big loss to supernatural horror. If you have ever walked through an old house late at night which you thought was haunted and felt the chills, then this film is for you.

1631645,A2LNVIYOP4RTO5,B00BEIYOHC,THREEKAY,"[0, 3]","Directed by James Wan (The Conjuring Fame), Produced by Jason Blum and Orum Peli, starring Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Lin Shayne, Ty Simpkins and Barbara Hershey. Music by Joseph Bishara.The Director seems to have mastered the subject of making horror movies that can scare the s*** out of audience watching this film.Storyline: The mysterious &#8216;astral projection&#8217; ability of Josh to be able to communicate with the Other World&#8217;s spirits leaves him possessed by the spirit of Parker Crane, who wants to kill his family, to keep himself young, through his evil mother. In an attempt to know about the possession, Elise gets killed, by Josh for knowing the secret. Twenty five years later, Dalton, the son of Josh inherits the same ability of Josh. During investigation of the death of Elise, her friend Carl also gets killed. The displaced spirits of Josh and Carl find Elise&#8217;s spirit in the other world only to discover that it was Peter&#8217;s mother who is killing young brides, after abusing Peter. Meanwhile, the real Josh who is possessed by Peter attacks his wife Renai and his kids at home. Just at the time when the possessed Josh is about to kill them, Elise evicts Parker&#8217;s mother in the Other World, thus freeing real Josh from Peter&#8217;s spirit. Josh and Carl in the other world, are fetched back to the real world by Dalton, with his ability to travel to the other world in sleep, and everyone is back to real world, finally. The movie ends with &#8216;astral projection&#8217; to be erased from the minds of Josh and Dalton through hypnosis by Carl.Positives: A sheer horror experience more than any of the previous projects of the Director. Thoroughly enjoyable screenplay with excellent cinematography and music. Can be phrased as &#8216;horror redefined&#8217;. Un-believable and fictitious characterization added fuel to fire. The memories of the movie carried for a long time by the spectators. The sound effects made the film one of the best horror films ever.Negatives: Definitely not for the weak-hearted and people with nervous disorders. Too many characters and over fictionalization confused the audience with no clear cut understanding of the story, if watched only once.My rating is 4 out of 5",4,Horror Redifined,1387584000,"12 21, 2013",2013,2254,"['Directed', 'James', 'Wan', 'Conjuring', 'Fame', 'Produced', 'Jason', 'Blum', 'Orum', 'Peli', 'starring', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'Lin', 'Shayne', 'Ty', 'Simpkins', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'Music', 'Joseph', 'Bishara.The', 'Director', 'have', 'mastered', 'subject', 'making', 'horror', 'movies', 'can', 'scare', 's***', 'audience', 'watching', 'film.Storyline', 'mysterious', '8216', 'astral', 'projection', '8217', 'ability', 'Josh', 'be', 'able', 'communicate', 'Other', 'World', '8217', 'spirits', 'possessed', 'spirit', 'Parker', 'Crane', 'who', 'kill', 'family', 'keep', 'young', 'evil', 'mother', 'attempt', 'know', 'possession', 'Elise', 'killed', 'Josh', 'knowing', 'secret', 'Twenty', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'Dalton', 'son', 'Josh', 'same', 'ability', 'Josh', 'investigation', 'death', 'Elise', 'friend', 'Carl', 'also', 'killed', 'displaced', 'spirits', 'Josh', 'Carl', 'find', 'Elise', '8217', 's', 'spirit', 'other', 'world', 'only', 'discover', 'was', 'Peter', '8217', 'mother', 'who', 'killing', 'young', 'brides', 'abusing', 'Peter', 'Meanwhile', 'real', 'Josh', 'who', 'possessed', 'Peter', 'attacks', 'wife', 'Renai', 'kids', 'home', 'Just', 'time', 'when', 'possessed', 'Josh', 'kill', 'Elise', 'Parker', '8217', 's', 'mother', 'Other', 'World', 'thus', 'freeing', 'real', 'Josh', 'Peter', '8217', 's', 'spirit', 'Josh', 'Carl', 'other', 'world', 'are', 'fetched', 'back', 'real', 'world', 'Dalton', 'ability', 'travel', 'other', 'world', 'sleep', 'everyone', 'back', 'real', 'world', 'finally', 'movie', '8216', 'astral', 'projection', '8217', 'be', 'erased', 'minds', 'Josh', 'Dalton', 'hypnosis', 'Carl.Positives', 'sheer', 'horror', 'experience', 'more', 'previous', 'projects', 'Director', 'Thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'screenplay', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'music', 'Can', 'be', 'phrased', '8216', 'horror', 'redefined', '8217', 'Un-believable', 'fictitious', 'characterization', 'added', 'fuel', 'fire', 'memories', 'movie', 'carried', 'long', 'time', 'spectators', 'sound', 'effects', 'made', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'films', 'Definitely', 'not', 'weak-hearted', 'people', 'nervous', 'disorders', 'Too', 'many', 'characters', 'fictionalization', 'confused', 'audience', 'clear', 'cut', 'understanding', 'story', 'watched', 'only', 'once.My', 'rating', '4', '5']",N/A

There appears to still be some belief among the police that Josh killed Alice who died at the end of the last movie but not enough to stop them from moving back into the house where Josh grew up. There, amid many flashbacks, how the trouble really started is explained.  Of course eerie happenings are already manifesting themselves--piano music at midnight, the baby's musical walker playing by itself--and Renai wants to leave but Josh is adamant that if they just ignore everything going on, it'll stop.As if.If that were so, this'd be the shortest horror movie in captivity.Although this was a well-done movie, camerawise, sometimes it was a little difficult to keep up with because of the scene-switching. In fact, in a couple of cases it looked as if some scenes were  out of order. They kept flipping from the Lambert homestead to a second house.

The first one was scary to me because of the possession of the little boy and creepy kids scare me a lot.

1631658,A2GQL7N0WDB818,B00BEIYOHC,Vira,"[0, 0]","I will say that I liked this Insidious better than the first one. The first one I found to be very hokey and disappointing. Why would I watch this one? I was bored and I figured I'd watch it just to watch it. I am running out of inexpensive flicks to watch. I think this was worth my few dollars to rent. TLDR for below: I didn't hate it. I would say watch it if you're running out of other scare films to watch.What I didn't like:*Over-used scare tactics - how many times do I have to see a scare film with people terrified of flickering lights, clothes in a closet or a toy rolling around on the floor? These things occur in my house often. I am pretty darned sure my house is not haunted.*The story was still &#34;hole-ridden&#34; in that there were things that didn't make sense. I know it's fiction, but fiction can still have its own physics and rules with far fewer swiss cheese story. I'll leave out specifics for less spoilers.*I would have liked more back-story on the main antagonist. There seems to be more than one, but I'm not sure. The ending clearly indicates another movie, but this one didn't do a lot of explaining of the current antagonist. Nor why the previous antagonist was involved. Part of the hole-ridden story I guess.What I did like:*I did think the story and acting improved from the first movie. I like Rose Byrne in these movies. She makes it feel less cheesy. I empathize easily with her and feel most of her actions make sense. Both kudos to her acting and maybe a bit of the story for her character.*It was interesting to have the movie start almost immediately where it ended from the previous movie. I'm not a huge move-watcher, so maybe this is done a lot, but it isn't something I have come across in the thriller/scare films I watch.*I actually liked the ending. The first film kind of ticked me off with the ending. The whole last 20 minutes or so seemed out of place. This one felt a little better. At least it wasn't worse than the first. Some people compared this to The Conjuring saying that The Conjuring was as bad or worse. I actually think The Conjuring was better.
