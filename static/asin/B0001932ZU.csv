With the help of her cheating ex-boyfriend and mysterious chess prodigy Domenec (Paudge Behan), Julia unravels the question of who killed the knight -- and why the picture was altered after it was finished.But that isn't the end -- Julia's ex-boyfriend turns up dead in the shower, and the kindly old owner of the painting dies within days. And with each death, a corresponding ivory chess piece is left on Julia's doorstep. As brutal heirs and conniving art dealers scrabble for the painting, Julia tries to unravel who is behind the killings -- before black queen takes white queen...""Uncovered"" is more interesting as a clever art puzzle than a murder mystery, set in Barcelona's sunny colourful streets and ancient castles. It is genuinely fascinating to see the hidden meanings of the chess game and its hidden meanings, as well as the politics of Burgundy versus France. This part is intriguing, intelligent, and genuinely has an element of classical mystery.Unfortunately, it sags when it turns into a murder mystery (with a bit of nudity thrown in), loosely tied into the medieval murder with the use of chess pieces. The murderer's identity is glaringly obvious even before he's killed anyone, and the campy, shrieky finale suffers because you already know who he is. Even the callous heirs to weren't enough to throw off the scent.This was only Kate Beckinsale's second major role, so perhaps she can be forgiven her mediocre performance. She's middling most of the time, and occasionally lapses into hysterical crying.

The art restorer has been raised by a fey gentleman who turns out to be part the current family requesting the restoration.  As she carefully uncovers the surface of the painting and has it xrayed, she finds clues to a mystery of a murder, a murder that slowly is recreated around her.

""Haunted"" (also staring Kate Beckinsale) and Adian Quin is a very well told story with a gripping plot.  ""Angels & Insects"" is another worth while film by this company.  However, ""Uncovered"" is roughly the worst film I've ever seen.  A complete waste of 2 hours, period.  In retrospect, there is nothing redeeming about this film whatsoever.  The acting is dreadful on every account (even Beckinsale, whom I like most of the time.)  The characters are totally undeveloped and unlikable; Beckinsale's G.I. Joe Haircut sometimes made it difficult to distinguish her form the men.  Although I think the worst part about this film was the soundtrack, absolutely horrifying!  (And I DON'T mean scary).  It was a really bad jazz theme, like Kenny G converted to elevator music.  It was like going to the drive-through at McDonalds and getting someone else's order.  There must have been a mix up at the editing room, this music could not have possibly been scored for a supposed mystery.  The music set the scene for a cheesy B-level romantic comedy (seriously).  It did not ad to the mystery feeling at all.  About a third of the way through, a 12-year-old could predict the outcome, even with the high-school-play level acting.

They're all casting meaningfully sidelong glances at each other.  Beneath the painting is a text, in Latin, asking `who killed the knight?'  As soon as Kate starts scraping off the old lacquer and paint that cover the inscription, folks around her start falling like ten pins.  And, to ratchet up the mystery some, chess pieces are left at her doorstep after every murder.Naturally, the police are ruling all the murders death by natural causes, Kate enlists a Spanish gypsy chess genius, beds are hopped with impunity, while I'm wondering why the heck I rented this one in the first place.  I'd never heard of Kate Beckinsale, and this one didn't convert me.  I don't think it had anything to do with her.  She has a certain gamin charm, and the couple of in-the-buff scenes convinced me her charms didn't stop with her smile.  The story is so lumbering and hokey, though, a bad soap opera unnaturally conjoined to a bad mystery, that I found it hard to rouse interest between the au natural bits.

She's an art restorer who stumbles across a mystery in the past that rides in to her future.There is much whimsy in this story. The characters almost seem like cartoons at first, but you soon find that this is their charm. The mystery is interesting and keeps you guessing. I thought I had the ending figured out, but I was happily wrong.The other major component of the storyline is the majesty of Barcelona. Barcelona's beauty is gallant and yet subtle. The wonderful architecture will wow you, the simple but stylish city streets and the simple but romantic people give this film a rich texture that will no doubt make you want to make Spain your next vacation spot.If this same film had been set in New York, it would have fallen dull. This could easily have fallen in to clique'. But instead it had a different adventure to give. The music is fun and transforms some of the more serious moments in to a blended feel of satisfaction. 'What you're doing is serious, but don't forget you're having fun.' Is the feeling I got from the score.I really enjoyed this film. It is not a deep mystery nor a passionate love affair and the dialog isn't Shakespeare, but that being said, you can sit and relax with this story. Most of the people are likable and you'll feel like you're among friends. Give it a try.

I first saw it on an imported videotape with Portugese subtitles.  More than likely, it is being released in the U.S. now to capitalize on Kate Beckinsale's increasingly high profile.  Its most noteworthy feature is the appearance of its comely star nude in no less than three scenes, her only such exposure to date.Viewers whose main interest is seeing Ms. Beckinsale ""uncovered"" will not be disappointed.  However, the movie itself is not so bad either.  Although a little rough by Hollywood standards, it offers a decent murder mystery with an interesting twist.  Beckinsale plays Julia, a rising star in the world of art restoration.  An aristocratic family commissions her to work on a Renaissance painting that has been in their possession for over 500 years.  It depicts two men playing chess while a woman watches in the background.  Julia quickly discovers that the painting has been altered and contains clues to the murder of one of the chess players.  As soon as Julia grows curious about this 500 year-old crime, someone begins killing people close to her.  She can only conclude that solving the ancient mystery will provide the key to her present-day horrors.While Julia continues to coax hidden details from the painting, she enlists the aid of a truly unique character.  She hires Domenec (Paudge Behan), a sort of ""chess bum,"" to work out the details of the game in the painting -- the moves that brought the pieces to where they are and the likely outcome of the game. The bohemian Domenick makes his living hustling high-stakes chess games (huh?).  His surfer-with-a-brain appearance and lifestyle provide both a foil and an eventual romantic allure for the uptight Julia.  From there, it becomes a race between this unlikely duo and the killer.

For those of you who are familiar with Arturo Perez Reverte's works, this movie is based on his novel titled 'The Flanders Panel' which in itself is a good thriller, though you do have to be familiar with the game of chess as that's crucial to the plot.This movie contains an early, rather tomboyish Kate Beckinsale, though still very much spirited. She plays an art restorer who finds there's a secret message in a piece of art that she's restoring, a panel that has been in a particular family of noble lineage for 500 years. She enlists the help of her ex-professor/ex-boyfriend Alvaro, played by Art Malik, who later turns up dead, presumably of natural causes. Well, turns out that Alvaro is the first in a series of deaths and Kate's character tries to decipher what's going on, with the help of a street chess player [based on the assumption that the deaths are related to the game of chess depicted in the panel].Anyway, the story though based on an interesting premise, soon turns out to be contrived, yet that doesn't detract from one's enjoyment of this movie. There are quite a few sexy scenes here, and quite a bit of nudity as well - Kate flashes bits of herself, and sometimes almost all of herself unabashedly, and this is early kate, very young and tomboyish, with a cropped hairstyle, yet displaying the peaches and cream beauty that still defines her today.The murderer in the story will be quite apparent to most viewers before the ending, yet I would still recommend it for its interesting premise and sexy bits.It might also interest some viewers that another of Arturo reverte's works, titled The Club Dumas was also made into a movie, The Ninth Gate [with Johnny Depp] which is a sort of literary/supernatural thriller.",3,Entertaining despite the contrived plot,1201046400,"01 23, 2008",2008,1839,"['stumbled', 'movie', 'DVD', 'rental', 'site', 'found', 'be', 'surprisingly', 'entertaining', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'Arturo', 'Perez', 'Reverte', 'works', 'movie', 'based', 'novel', 'titled', 'Flanders', 'Panel', 'good', 'thriller', 'do', 'have', 'be', 'familiar', 'game', 'chess', 'crucial', 'plot.This', 'movie', 'early', 'rather', 'tomboyish', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'spirited', 'art', 'restorer', 'who', 'secret', 'message', 'piece', 'art', 'restoring', 'panel', 'been', 'particular', 'family', 'noble', 'lineage', '500', 'years', 'help', 'ex-professor/ex-boyfriend', 'Alvaro', 'played', 'Art', 'Malik', 'who', 'later', 'up', 'dead', 'presumably', 'natural', 'causes', 'Well', 'out', 'Alvaro', 'first', 'series', 'deaths', 'Kate', 'character', 'tries', 'decipher', 'what', 'going', 'help', 'street', 'chess', 'player', '[', 'based', 'assumption', 'deaths', 'are', 'related', 'game', 'chess', 'depicted', 'panel', ']', '.Anyway', 'story', 'based', 'interesting', 'premise', 'soon', 'out', 'be', 'contrived', 'yet', ""n't"", 'detract', 'one', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'sexy', 'scenes', 'here', 'quite', 'bit', 'nudity', 'well', 'Kate', 'bits', 'herself', 'sometimes', 'almost', 'unabashedly', 'early', 'kate', 'very', 'young', 'tomboyish', 'cropped', 'hairstyle', 'yet', 'displaying', 'peaches', 'cream', 'beauty', 'still', 'today.The', 'murderer', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'quite', 'apparent', 'most', 'viewers', 'ending', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'interesting', 'premise', 'sexy', 'bits.It', 'might', 'also', 'interest', 'viewers', 'Arturo', 'reverte', 'works', 'titled', 'Club', 'Dumas', 'was', 'also', 'made', 'movie', 'Ninth', 'Gate', '[', 'Johnny', 'Depp', ']', 'sort', 'literary/supernatural', 'thriller']",Uncovered
