1287457,A2FMPWCAQSQJ2E,B002SSQCS6,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","One of the most fun interval workouts I've done. High-impact segments alternated with easy to follow dance sections (led by a different instructor) to get your heart rate down in-between, very clever since dance workouts by themselves are usually not aerobically challenging (for me anyway). The cardio portion is about 40 minutes or so then followed by about 30 minutes of weights and abs. Great total body workout in about 75 minutes.

1287458,A1GXSYZ9D2UPA0,B002SSQCS6,"Colette ""Mirabel""","[2, 2]","I have all of Jari's videos, enjoy them all and am very pleased with the last 3 that I had pre-ordered as well. They have a really good cardio section that I've been using along with Tracy Anderson's mat workouts when I cannot take the high impact of her dance video on consecutive days. I enjoy the dance section in Body Rock, a pleasant departure from Jari's other videos as well as her high-low section which is again a great option to the higher impact stuff while successfully raising your heart-rate.I can see not liking it if dance videos are not your cup of tea, but this routine is fun, easy to learn and works your core really well. I don't see any problems with the set, chatter or the costumes that another reviewer mentioned. Doing the workout keeps me plenty absorbed so I don't see this as a distraction. I'm also glad that Jari attempted something different for this latest series, helps break up the boredom and gives you a choice for what you feel like doing on any given day, plus there is also a much better abs portion in these videos which I always wished she in the others.",5,A fun and energizing workout to alternate with others,1267315200,"02 28, 2010",2010,1096,"['have', 'Jari', 'videos', 'enjoy', 'am', 'very', 'pleased', 'last', '3', 'had', 'pre-ordered', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'really', 'good', 'cardio', 'section', ""'ve"", 'been', 'using', 'along', 'Tracy', 'Anderson', 'mat', 'when', 'can', 'not', 'take', 'high', 'impact', 'dance', 'video', 'consecutive', 'days', 'enjoy', 'dance', 'section', 'Body', 'Rock', 'pleasant', 'departure', 'Jari', 'other', 'videos', 'as', 'well', 'high-low', 'section', 'again', 'great', 'option', 'higher', 'impact', 'stuff', 'successfully', 'raising', 'heart-rate.I', 'can', 'see', 'not', 'liking', 'dance', 'videos', 'are', 'not', 'cup', 'tea', 'routine', 'fun', 'easy', 'learn', 'works', 'core', 'really', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'problems', 'set', 'chatter', 'costumes', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'Doing', 'workout', 'plenty', 'absorbed', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'distraction', ""'m"", 'also', 'glad', 'Jari', 'attempted', 'something', 'different', 'latest', 'series', 'break', 'up', 'boredom', 'choice', 'what', 'feel', 'doing', 'given', 'day', 'also', 'much', 'better', 'abs', 'portion', 'videos', 'always', 'wished', 'others']",N/A
1287459,ALNH883C26T3Q,B002SSQCS6,J. Hogan,"[4, 6]",I was very dissappointed in this workout. I have almost all of the Jari Love workouts. I do one or more of the Extremely Ripped series every week. I was excited because this did sound like a different type of workout for her but it was just too different for me.I started the workout on the entire workout but after 2 dance combo's I had to stop and go straight to the Jari cardio only. The dance parts just could not get my heart rate up to a workout level. Plus I was bored. The Jari Love cardio sections also were not great. I usually feel her workouts are intense but these cardio segments were just ok and the transitions were horrible.The weight section was better but it still did not keep my heart rate elevated like her more recent extreme circuits have been doing. I was very dissappointed in my workout after this tape. I don't expect to ever use it again. I still love Jari Love but this was just not her usual high intense workout.,2,Not the Jari Love that I know,1265846400,"02 11, 2010",2010,944,"['was', 'very', 'dissappointed', 'workout', 'have', 'almost', 'Jari', 'Love', 'do', 'one', 'more', 'Extremely', 'Ripped', 'series', 'week', 'was', 'excited', 'did', 'sound', 'different', 'type', 'workout', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'different', 'me.I', 'started', 'workout', 'entire', 'workout', '2', 'dance', 'combo', 'had', 'stop', 'go', 'straight', 'Jari', 'cardio', 'only', 'dance', 'parts', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'workout', 'level', 'was', 'bored', 'Jari', 'Love', 'cardio', 'sections', 'also', 'were', 'not', 'great', 'usually', 'feel', 'workouts', 'are', 'intense', 'cardio', 'segments', 'were', 'just', 'ok', 'transitions', 'were', 'horrible.The', 'weight', 'section', 'was', 'better', 'still', 'did', 'not', 'keep', 'heart', 'rate', 'elevated', 'more', 'recent', 'extreme', 'circuits', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'was', 'very', 'dissappointed', 'workout', 'tape', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'ever', 'use', 'again', 'still', 'love', 'Jari', 'Love', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'usual', 'high', 'intense', 'workout']",N/A

1287461,A2V5R832QCSOMX,B002SSQCS6,Leanne,"[50, 51]","I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this workout since the description of it both here on Amazon and on Jari's website were pretty vague.  Since I have all seven of Jari's previous workouts and really like them, though, I pre-ordered this workout since I always like what she does.  This workout definitely marks a new direction for Jari -- and it's a good one!Basically, there are four premixes on the main menu that you can choose from:  the Complete Workout, the High/Low Workout, the Dance Workout, and the Weights/Abs Workout.  If you choose to do the Complete Workout, the entire thing  comes in at just around 65 or 70 minutes long.  The idea behind the Complete Workout is that she has you do 2-3 minutes of high- and low-impact routines and 3 minutes of dance moves that are alternated.  In some of Jari's more recent workouts, she alternates weight and cardio segments, but in this newest workout, you do all your cardio, and then you do the weight and ab work at the end, once you've finished your cardio.  From what Jari said in the intro to the workout, the idea is to bust through any weight loss plateaus and shake up your routine a bit.There are some aspects of this workout that are definitely new for Jari.  The warm-up section only has her -- with none of her usual backup crew, and it felt sort of rushed to me.  Also, the biggest surprise to me was that the Dance section isn't led by Jari -- it's led by a woman named Angie who has her own crew of backup dancers.  There are no male background exercisers in this workout, which was another surprise since Jari usually includes at least one male.From what Jari also said in the introduction to this video, the Weights segment is designed to be an update of Slim and Lean, and I found that the exercises in this section definitely did remind me a lot of Slim and Lean.  Instead of doing compound moves where you work legs and an upper body part at the same time (which Jari's last few workouts have been like), this workout focuses on just working one body part (chest, shoulders, etc.) at a time in isolated moves.Also, since the weights section moves pretty quickly, Jari doesn't explain form.  For that reason, I wouldn't recommend this workout for beginners, but would suggest getting one of Jari's earlier workouts so you can learn proper form.Here is a breakdown of the Complete Workout:--Warm-Up (just Jari by herself)--Salsa section (led by Angie and her crew of backup dancers)--Alternating Knee and Heels (hi/low led by Jari and with her usual crew)--Latin section (led by Angie again; builds on earlier Salsa section)--Jacks (led by Jari)--Jazz dance (led by Angie)--Guitar Knee (led by Jari)--Disco section (led by Angie)--Heel Kicks (led by Jari)--Funky dance (led by Angie)--Knees Up (led by Jari)--Hip Hop (led by Angie)--Heels Up and Cooldown  (led by Jari, but Angie joins the Jari group)**move into Weights and Abs section (this whole section is just led by Jari)**--Squat/Hamstring track--Chest and Triceps track (the chest track is one of the hardest on any of Jari's workouts!)--Back and Wide Back track--Biceps and Shoulders track--Abs--Stretch and CooldownAs far as the weight exercises go, a few of the weight moves are from her previous workouts, but one of the things I really like about Jari's videos is that she always comes up with new weight moves, and this workout is no exception.The dance and hi/low portions were also a lot of fun to do!  I had to push myself in a few of the dance sections to get my heart rate up there, but it was a fun change from the last few Jari workouts that use the step for the cardio sections.  In fact, there is no step used for this workout at all, which makes set-up nice and easy.Some of the music is from her previous workouts, but it wasn't too noticeable. The music for the weights section was great!The biggest negative I see with this workout is that if you do the Complete Workout (which is how I intend to use it), your heart rate drops between each dance and hi/lo aerobics segment since the segment ends, and a screen comes up that tells you what's coming next.  It doesn't flow very well, so I found myself doing jumping jacks or jogging in place to keep my heart rate up.  There also isn't a lot of explanation by Angie in the dance segments, but she only has you do two or three moves in each section, and I found that as long as I was moving, I got my heart rate up -- even if I couldn't keep up and look as graceful as the dancers!Overall, this is a fun new workout.  If you like Jari's other DVD's, then you will probably also really like this one.  I've gotten great results from using her workouts for four to six weeks at a time (getting more definition and losing body fat), and I can see myself using this one a lot. Despite its negatives, I still give it five stars since others may not think that the problematic areas I noted are problematic.I'll also try to update my review after I've done it a few more times.UPDATE ON 2/5/10:  After doing this workout a second time, I realized that the break segments between the dance and hi/lo segments really aren't too long at all -- so my heart rate did a nice job of staying up there.  In fact, the hi/lo segments are tough enough that the dance segments provided a nice recovery.  One big negative, though, is that the hi/lo segments just start in midstream; this was probably meant to keep your heart rate high, but it was odd editing since some segments started with Jari and the background exercisers in the middle of a move.  Jari's hi/lo sections were also classic ""old school"" hi/lo aerobics:  lots of knee lifts, jacks, etc.  Two of the background exercisers and Jari are modifying and doing the low-impact version in each segment.Jari's warm-up is still much too fast for me!  I felt like she was going at warp speed.  Also, in her hi/lo sections, there are five back-up gals, and the set/screen almost felt too cluttered with six people in front of me.  Like another reviewer said, the set and outfits are still really dark on this workout, but that doesn't bother me too much.  I do prefer the brighter set and clothes on her earlier workouts, but the darkness isn't too bad, and I've gotten used to it in her last few workouts.I also agree that the weights portion is where this workout really excels.  I loved the techno music, and this section of the workout felt really high energy. True, this section is short (about 30 minutes long), but I really loved it and can see myself doing this section a lot on its own if I want a quick weight workout.  There isn't as much focus on the legs as there is in Jari's other workouts, but my legs really felt the hi/lo aerobics sections, so I felt like they got a good workout overall.Other than that, it was still a fun workout the second time through, despite the few negative aspects of it.  For me, this had good ""fun factor"" and I can see myself doing this one a lot.",5,"Really fun, and a new direction for Jari",1265155200,"02 3, 2010",2010,6932,"['was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure',

I am continusly surprised at the price of her DVD's, I would pay twice what they cost. She is an amazing instructor - she really knows what she's doing. I particularly enjoy her website and all the helpful hints she provides. She is great!!!!I dont have all of her dvd's just yet but I do have 3 including this one and cannot wait to get the rest of them.I also waited for awhile before commenting on this dvd. I wanted to do it for awhile and be sure of how I really felt about it. I can say that I do think Jari's other DVD's are more effective. I have Ripped and Chisled and Get Extremly Ripped 1000 and I cannot tell you how much I love them and what great results I get when I am eating properly. Excellent, Excellent! One thing you will hear again and again in the fitness world is that you must have variety to acheive weight loss, toning, definition goals. Variety is what shakes things up, keeps your body guessing so that you dont get into plateau. I think that is the great thing about this DVD. It is different than Jari's other DVD's and most other DVD's and I love that she took a chance and did somethnig different and it really does work.Warm Up: I agree the warm up is really fast. I didnt like it at first but after doing it several times I really like it! I feel like it wakes me up and gets me going. I love Jari's energy. I like that she did something different by warming up along. It feels like she is training you personally. I love her comments at the beginning here to give the workout all you have.Hi/Low Cardio portion: I agree that the cardio is not as intense as some other dvds, you have to really put your back into it to get and keep your heart rate up. But Jari acknowledges this at the beginning of the DVD in the warm up section to put your all into it. The thing is I found when I do work harder it is a very good workout. Like someone said at first you are kind of thrown off with the old school moves that seem really lame at first but then as you do it a few times you get into it and its fun! I still dont like that when you go from the dance to the cardio part they are in the middle of the moves. The choreography is also awkward at times but I like that Jari doesnt try to be perfect or make her crew seem like they are perfect they are just like us just in WAY better shape then most of us :).Dance portion: I sometimes will not do the dance portion bc I just cant keep my heart rate up enough and it doesnt feel like a good workout. But it is fun and you can actually learn some cool dance moves. My husband and I are taking a dance class and doing these moves actually helped me! I love that Jari had a professional dancer lead this instead of doing it herself. She is humble and awesome what a smart move to get into the dance workout dvd's and yet stay in her element of expertise. I love that!Weight and ABs: As everyone said this section is stellar and more closely matches Jari's other DVD's yet you dont feel like you are doing the same old moves.

But this was too dancy, and she was not even the instructor for those dance segments.  In the future, I would suggest Jari stays with more conventional cardio workouts, like the segments SHE led in this video.  I wish she had done the whole video with those types of segments.

1287466,A39MD3N21Z8OUU,B002SSQCS6,The Mrs.,"[2, 2]","NOTE: This review does not include any info for the Cardio/Dance portion of the DVDI can't understand the negative comments about this DVD! I tried this DVD for the first time and I enjoyed the Weight/Ab-only option! Granted many people would/will want to take advantage of the cardio since this is half of DVD, but for what you get in the 30 min total body workout (35 min including warm up) is well worth the price tag. I've tried all of the major strength instructors and name brands on the maket and then some and Jari is really quite unique in her approach. You will do 50-75 reps of each exercise at various tempos and patterns. Having not done a really high rep workout before, I was pleasently surprised by the workout I got and by the amount I was sweating. If you've ever done a workout by The Firm which is supposedly ""high rep"", this blows their high rep count out of the water. I'm a fan of Cathe Friedrich's Gym Styles Series and Muscle Max which is higher rep than most of her other workouts. You will do approx 36 reps give or take with each exercise and that comes out to sometimes well over 100 for each muscle group. However she uses various weight rest techniques. If I were to compare the two instructors workouts I would say Jari's workouts would have to over time be better for injury prevention. Cathe's workouts would be better for adding fast-twitch muscle fiber which some women wrongly call this ""bulking"", whereas Jari's will define and develop the exsisting muscle fibers you have while building additional endurance fibers (slow twich) as needed (when weight is increased).Having several prior injuries, and after researching her methods, am convinced that her workouts are the way to go for me. If you are used to strength training you will feel the burn in areas of the body that you forgot about. My biceps were screaming which is one of the hardest muscles for me to fatigue without hurting my shoulders. My wrists were sore, but in a good way, and my hamstrings and low back started burning by the end of those particular muscle tracks. In this 30 minute workout all major muscle groups are worked. Jari either combines exercises (ex shoulders: Lat raises along with a 6 count isometric hold pattern; The back gets 2 versions of 1 arm rows...). With all of the pulsing and tempo changes just when you can't do another rep you're usually close to her switching tracks or switching to the 2nd muscle group within the track. It's a nice way to give those muscles a short break without pausing the DVD. I especially needed this during the squat/back track. My legs were like jello and just when they were dust we went back for a second round of back rows and finished out with a few more various squat exercises. I used 3, 5, and 8 lbs dumbbells which is lighter than I would go for any other DVD/instructor but you really need it. 3s had my shoulders fried and one woman on the DVD uses 10s! There is just in weight increases alone, a lot of room to grow.On a side note, all of the background exercisers use Jari's workouts on a regualr basis, most doing them 2-4 times per week. Some even teach her classes. If you look at these women's bodies, OMG are they motivating!! Several of the women are 40+ and look better than ppl in their 20s. I was for many months concerned with doing high rep workouts for the sheer fact that I wouldn't be building great amounts of muscle; Think Cathe STS or 4 Day Split for great builders! I didn't want my muscle to waste away and look like Jari. However after researching and looking at the participants in the DVDs, I don't have that concern anymore. You can tell that much depends on their body types and Jari looks like she's an Ectomorph which would explain why so looks so thin. Some of those women have some killer arms and legs...looking like fitness models from Oxygen Magazine but the difference: They use lighter weights and probably suffer fewer lifting injuries.Again, I can't comment on the dance segments as I am not into dance-style aerobics, but for the price you get an amazing 30 min total body workout; which is my sole reason for purchase. For those sort on time or looking to switch it up here and there, you really can't beat that. I had been using the Firm's workouts when I needed something less than 45 minutes in length, but to honest, I really did like this workout so much more. It went by faster, had me working harder, and IMO worked the muscle groups more effectively without dread or the same old moves (lunges throughout the Firm's DVDs). I would also consider this to be a very knee-friendly workout. I have knee issues and I work out on carpet... no problems what so ever.4.5 Stars for me!",5,Great for Weight-Only Workout Option!,1275350400,"06 1, 2010",2010,4693,"['NOTE', 'review', 'not', 'include', 'info', 'Cardio/Dance', 'portion', 'DVDI', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'negative', 'comments', 'DVD', 'tried', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', 'enjoyed', 'Weight/Ab-only', 'option', 'Granted', 'many', 'people', 'would/will', 'want', 'take', 'advantage', 'cardio', 'half', 'DVD', 'what', 'get', '30', 'min', 'total', 'body', 'workout', '35', 'min', 'including', 'warm', 'up', 'well', 'price', 'tag', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'major', 'strength', 'instructors', 'name', 'brands', 'maket', 'then', 'Jari', 'really', 'quite', 'unique', 'approach', 'will', 'do', '50-75', 'reps', 'exercise', 'various', 'tempos', 'patterns', 'Having', 'not', 'done', 'really', 'high', 'rep', 'workout', 'was', 'pleasently', 'surprised', 'workout', 'got', 'amount', 'was', 'sweating', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'done', 'workout', 'Firm', 'supposedly', 'high', 'rep', 'high', 'rep', 'count', 'water', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Cathe', 'Friedrich', 'Gym', 'Styles', 'Series', 'Muscle', 'Max', 'higher', 'rep', 'most', 'other', 'workouts', 'will', 'do', 'approx', '36', 'reps', 'give', 'take', 'exercise', 'out', 'sometimes', 'well', '100', 'muscle', 'group', 'However', 'various', 'weight', 'rest', 'techniques', 'were', 'compare', 'two', 'instructors', 'workouts', 'would', 'say', 'Jari', 'workouts', 'would', 'have', 'over', 'time', 'be', 'better', 'injury', 'prevention', 'Cathe', 'workouts', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'adding', 'fast-twitch', 'muscle', 'fiber', 'women', 'wrongly', 'call', 'bulking', 'Jari', 'will', 'define', 'develop', 'exsisting', 'muscle', 'fibers', 'have', 'building', 'additional', 'endurance', 'fibers', 'slow', 'twich', 'needed', 'when', 'weight', 'increased', '.Having', 'several', 'prior', 'injuries', 'researching', 'methods', 'am', 'convinced', 'workouts', 'are', 'way', 'go', 'are', 'used', 'strength', 'training', 'will', 'feel', 'burn', 'areas', 'body', 'forgot', 'biceps', 'were', 'screaming', 'one', 'hardest', 'muscles', 'fatigue', 'hurting', 'shoulders', 'wrists', 'were', 'sore', 'good', 'way', 'hamstrings', 'low', 'back', 'started', 'burning', 'end', 'particular', 'muscle', 'tracks', '30', 'minute', 'major', 'muscle', 'groups', 'are', 'worked', 'Jari', 'combines', 'exercises', 'ex', 'shoulders', 'Lat', 'along', '6', 'count', 'isometric', 'hold', 'pattern', 'back', '2', 'versions', '1', 'arm', 'rows', 'pulsing', 'tempo', 'changes', 'just', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'rep', ""'re"", 'usually', 'close', 'switching', 'tracks', 'switching', '2nd', 'muscle', 'group', 'track', 'nice', 'way', 'give', 'muscles', 'short', 'break', 'pausing', 'DVD', 'especially', 'needed', 'squat/back', 'track', 'legs', 'were', 'jello', 'just', 'when', 'were', 'dust', 'went', 'back', 'second', 'round', 'back', 'rows', 'finished', 'out', 'few', 'more', 'various', 'squat', 'exercises', 'used', '3', '5', '8', 'lbs', 'dumbbells', 'lighter', 'would', 'go', 'other', 'DVD/instructor', 'really', 'need', '3s', 'had', 'shoulders', 'fried', 'one', 'woman', 'DVD', '10s', 'just', 'weight', 'increases', 'alone', 'lot', 'room', 'grow.On', 'side', 'note', 'background', 'exercisers', 'use', 'Jari', 'workouts', 'regualr', 'basis', 'most', 'doing', '2-4', 'times', 'week', 'even', 'teach', 'classes', 'look', 'women', 'bodies', 'are', 'motivating', 'Several', 'women', 'are', '40+', 'look', 'better', 'ppl', '20s', 'was', 'many', 'months', 'concerned', 'doing', 'high', 'rep', 'workouts', 'sheer', 'fact', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'building', 'great', 'amounts', 'muscle', 'Think', 'Cathe', 'STS', '4', 'Day', 'Split', 'great', 'builders', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'muscle', 'waste', 'away', 'look', 'Jari', 'However', 'researching', 'looking', 'participants', 'DVDs', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'concern', 'anymore', 'can', 'tell', 'that', 'much', 'depends', 'body', 'types', 'Jari', 'Ectomorph', 'would', 'explain', 'why', 'so', 'so', 'thin', 'women', 'have', 'killer', 'arms', 'legs', 'looking', 'fitness', 'models', 'Oxygen', 'Magazine', 'difference', 'use', 'lighter', 'weights', 'probably', 'suffer', 'fewer', 'lifting', 'injuries.Again', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'dance', 'segments', 'am', 'not', 'dance-style', 'aerobics', 'price', 'get', 'amazing', '30', 'min', 'total', 'body', 'workout', 'sole', 'reason', 'purchase', 'sort', 'time', 'looking', 'switch', 'up', 'here', 'there', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'had', 'been', 'using', 'Firm', 'workouts', 'when', 'needed', 'something', 'less', '45', 'minutes', 'length', 'honest', 'really', 'did', 'workout', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'went', 'faster', 'had', 'working', 'harder', 'IMO', 'worked', 'muscle', 'groups', 'more', 'effectively', 'dread', 'same', 'old', 'moves', 'lunges', 'Firm', 'DVDs', 'would', 'also', 'consider', 'be', 'very', 'knee-friendly', 'workout', 'have', 'knee', 'issues', 'work', 'out', 'carpet', 'problems', 'what', 'so', 'ever.4.5', 'Stars']",N/A
