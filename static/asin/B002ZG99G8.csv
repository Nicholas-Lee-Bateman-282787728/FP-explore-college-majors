Even though there are a lot of characters, they did a decent job of getting them across to the audience.  Again, the acting and dialogue was decent.unfortunately, the plot was a touch on the thin side.  The villain is almost cartoonish in his depth and actions and that was to the detriment of the film (even though his performance was good).I would have rated this film higher, but truthfully this action genre has a lot of good films in it like the Bourne Series, Transporter, etc and this film is not at that level by any stretch (no fault of the acting, script is just weak).So, I had to give it 3 stars.

It follows them from the betrayal through an adventure to try and clear their names. It leaves things well wrapped up but open enough for a sequel (which I would love to see, because this really was fun to watch).I really enjoyed watching this movie. Its just a really fun popcorn flick. Lots of action and humor, just enough depth to the characters to really keep you interested. It is also a really fun cast.  Jeffrey Dean Morgan does a really good job of being the anchor of the team, both as the character's role and as an actor. Idris Elba is fantastic as Roque, the darker side of Morgan's Clay. Watching the two of them interplay is just fantastic.  Chris Evans is fantastic as Jensen (who is probably the best uncle ever--watch it and you will see what I mean). He just nails the character's wise cracking attitude (I have a certain fondness both for him and for wisecracking characters)The plot rolls along at a pretty nice clip. There is plenty of action, but not to the point where it is only action, there is some really fun dialogue and some really great scenes that actually don't involve explosions. Chris Evans has a wonderful scene in an elevator that involves some quipping and an outfit change.I enjoyed Zoe Saldana in this role as well, I prefer her with a bit more spunk, and she has it in spades here.

It's got humor, `splosions, and an over-the-top bad guy played by Jason Patric.

CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[2, 2]","The Losers is a story of betrayal and retribution that doesn't take itself too seriously that concerns an elite U.S. Special Forces unit sent into the Bolivian jungle on a mission that goes awry. Were they set up by someone within their own government? The team: Clay, Jensen, Roque, Pooch and Cougar, must go rogue since they have been betrayed by the mysterious and powerful Max, an operative high up in the heirarchy of the CIA. They are recruited by the beautiful Aisha, who may have her own agenda, but it is one that also involves getting revenge on Max. Working together, they must remain deep undercover while tracking the heavily-guarded Max, a ruthless man bent on embroiling the world in a new high-tech global war.The Losers is based on the DC Vertigo graphic novel by Andy Diggle with illustrations by Jock. It is an action thriller but there are also a lot of strangely bent and humorous moments, mostly provided by Jensen (Chris Evans), the designated comic relief, but the rest of the cast also get in a zinger or two. The scene where Clay (JMD) and Aisha meet--ostensibly a hook up but actually Aisha knows exactly who Clay is and is recruiting him--is amazing. It is smokin' hot, if you like fighting as foreplay, and Clay and Aisha definitely do.---------------Aisha: [whistles at the sight of Clay's Bolivian hotel room] Wow. It's everything a girl can dream of. Do you have a bathroom?Clay: No, I specifically requested the only hotel room in the world that doesn't have a bathroom.==========Jeffrey Dean Morgan was in Watchmen, and this scene reminds me of a similar one between Nite Owl II and Silk Spectere II. Hard to say which scene is my favorite, but they are both intense. Jeffrey Dean Morgan was also Denny Duquette on Grey's Anatomy, but after two great performances in Watchmen and The Losers, he is exonerated and his stint on Grey's is expunged from his record.---------------------------Roque: Okay, you stay with us. But if anything smells like a trap, I get to put a bullet in your skull. Does that sound fair?Aisha: That sounds fun.Jensen: Sounds like my parents...=============Aisha is played to perfection by Zo Salda&ntilde;a. She was Neytiri in Avatar, Nyota Uhura in 2009's Star Trek, Anamaria in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, and Laila in Drumline. But what really impresses me is that she was in 2002's Crossroads with Britney Spears. That film also had a Grey's Anatomy connection in that it was written by Shonda Rhimes, the creator and head writer of Grey's. But Zo has a beautiful body, so we won't hold that against her. Zo Salda&ntilde;a is beautiful and talented and her star is definitely on the rise.---------------------------------Clay: Jensen, are we wired?Jensen: [disguised as a street vendor] Max is westbound... and these hot dogs are *delicious!*=============Chris Evans as Jensen was brilliant. As Johnny Storm in The Fantastic Four he was also a stand out, a perfect mix of cocky self assurance and self deprecating mockery. Great rapport/tension between Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm, too. It's clobberin' time! As Jensen, Chris Evans was my favorite Loser (Zo Salda&ntilde;a wasn't an actual Loser, so Evans wins).---------------------------Clay: Whatta you have on her?Jensen: Besides a pant-bustin' crush? Her Company file is blank. CIA has a standing kill order on her, as does Hamas, Sinn Fein... pretty much everyone with the exception of PETA wants this chick am-scrayed.=============Roque, Pooch and Cougar may be Losers, but they are no slouches. And did I mention Jason Patric as the evil Max? Does anyone remember him as Michael in The Lost Boys? He was an excellent villian in The Losers. He was on par with Sam Rockwell in Iron Man II, or Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom in Fantastic Four.------------------------Roque: Come, on, Clay! Look around you. I mean, do you think we're in a position to actually take on some CIA super-spook?Clay: Roque...Roque: It's a hell of a plan. You know what? Pooch could set up over there by the taco stand, and Jensen could set up communications right there by the hookers.============The Bottom Line is that The Losers was a very entertaining film with great action and special effects sequences, but it also offered character development, both comedic and dramatic. This film came out before the remake of The A-Team and the Sylverster Stallone vehicle, The Expendables. I just saw the trailers for those other two films, but can't imagine that either film was as good as The Losers. Don't know why The Losers didn't do better at the box office. Got the feeling that A Team was a botched effort, but Expendables may have been worth a watch just for the cast of action heros, both young and old. The Losers was a tightly written action movie with some laughs along the way and at least one very sexy scene. It had everything you could ask for in a movie of this genre. Zo Salda&ntilde;a won my heart, but Chris Evans was my favorite Loser.---------------------------Roque: [Seeing Jenson's Pink Petunia shirt] Am I the only one who sees this shirt?Jensen: Oh, yeah. It's my niece's little league soccer team, the Petunias, they're in the finals, so I...[the whole team walks away in disgust]Jensen: They're... they're in the finals!=============Watchmen: The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)(2009) Jeffrey Dean Morgan was Edward Blake / The ComedianAvatar(2009) Zo Salda&ntilde;a was NeytiriStar Trek (Single-Disc Edition)(2009) (as Zo Salda&ntilde;a) Zo Salda&ntilde;a was Nyota UhuraVantage Point : Widescreen Edition(2008) (as Zo Salda&ntilde;a) Zo Salda&ntilde;a was Angie JonesDownloading Nancy(2008) Jason Patric was LouisFantastic Four (Widescreen Edition)(2005) Chris Evans was Johnny StormPirates of the Caribbean - The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)(2003) Zo Salda&ntilde;a was AnamariaDrumline (Widescreen)(2002) (as Zo Salda&ntilde;a) Zo Salda&ntilde;a was LailaCrossroads(2002) (as Zo Salda&ntilde;a) Zo Salda&ntilde;a was KitThe Lost Boys(1987) Jason Patric was Michael----------------Jensen: Did you know that cats can make one thousand different sounds and dogs can only make ten?

Yet, it does not act like a Bond picture.According to boxofficemojo dot com, its production budget was $23,591,432.However, its domestic gross was only $23,591,432.

1312293,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002ZG99G8,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 2]","""The Losers"" has been released on the heels of ""Kick-Ass,"" a comic book adaptation that audiences love and will probably always prefer. That's a shame. ""The Losers"" is, in my view, a winner - vastly superior as an action spectacle, a comedy, a character study, and above all, a story. This means that, while it certainly revels in all manner of fun comic book violence, it also has the ambition to be about more than violence; we're engaged because we're actually being told something. I left the theater feeling not empty and sad, as I had with ""Kick-Ass,"" but energized, entertained, and satisfied instead. This is how the movies are supposed to make you feel, right? For the first time in what felt like ages, I was confident that I had gotten my money's worth.Based on the comic book series created by Andy Diggle, ""The Losers"" begins in Bolivia, where we find five tough CIA agents on a mission to take out a ruthless drug lord at his compound. They are: Jake Jensen, a hacker (Chris Evans); ""Cougar"" Alvarez, a long-distance sniper (Oscar Jaenada); ""Pooch"" Porteous, the pilot (Columbus Short); William Roque, the second in command (Idris Elba); and the team leader, Franklin Clay (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). When the mission goes wrong and ends in the death of twenty-five innocent children, our five men realize that they've been set up by a mysterious figure known only as Max and vow to have their revenge. They're no longer CIA - they're the Losers.They've officially been declared dead in the U.S., leaving them stranded in Bolivia without money or a way to get home. Then along comes Aisha (Zoe Saldana), who repeatedly proves she isn't quite what she seems; she meets Clay as he dines on steak in a seedy dive, and although she comes onto him in the least subtle of ways, their retreat to his hotel room doesn't end the way one would expect. Long story short: She claims she knows where Max is and can get the Losers home. Clay is immediately taken with her. Pooch, Cougar, and Jensen are willing to go along with her. Roque, however, isn't convinced, nor is he sold on the idea of revenge against Max. All he wants to do is get out of the game and live the rest of his life.And speaking of Max (Jason Patric), he never seems to be in the same place twice, always travelling around the world making deals with shady people for his own equally shady purposes. What is his scheme? Let's just say that it involves one of the coolest terrorist weapons ever conceived of for a comic book adaptation. How fitting for a man with the most extraordinary sense of humor, always with the sarcasm, the dry wit, and the homicidal tendencies (God forbid the wind should accidentally blow aside an umbrella if you're holding it over his head). Funny and oh so bad, Max is the most deliciously evil movie villain since Colonel Hans Landa from ""Inglourious Basterds.""Great humor can also be found amongst the Losers, especially Jensen, who, despite not having seen her for some time, is devoted to his niece and her school's Soccer team. I particularly enjoyed a scene in which he must improvise a way to escape the security guards in a Miami office building; with a little help from Cougar, he pretends to have telekinetic abilities, which he says gives him the ability to shoot bullets with nothing but his pointed fingers. He seems to enjoy Journey's ""Don't Stop Believin',"" and so too does director Sylvain White, seeing as he strategically has it playing during some of the more intense actions sequences. You'd think it would be a horrible fit, but no - it's actually quite amusing.And as for Clay and Aisha, not only are they a pleasure to look at, their subplot is also very intriguing, probably because both are troubled characters with goals in mind, neither able to reach them without the other one's help. I know it's an awfully overused critical observation, but it's true: Morgan and Saldana have great onscreen chemistry, not merely as love interests, but also as occasional adversaries. In some ways, that's even harder to achieve; it takes more effort for actors to fight well than to love well, probably because fighting is generally more realistic.What fun this movie is. There aren't enough like them these days. Sure, you can spend your money on ""Kick-Ass,"" but I think you'd be doing yourself a great disservice. ""The Losers"" is proof that even comic book adaptations can successfully be more than mean and mindless depictions of violence. Yes, there's plenty of action, but there's also a plot, and it involves characters who are not only magnetic, but are also given some depth. Nowhere is this more evident than in the film's final sequences, both of which display a goofy sweetness I found very appealing. Obvious work went into the screenplay. Obvious work went into the whole film. When movies like this come around, it makes me wonder why many other comic filmmakers don't try a little harder.",4,Vengeance is Theirs,1271980800,"04 23, 2010",2010,4914,"['Losers', 'been', 'released', 'heels', 'Kick-Ass', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptation', 'love', 'will', 'probably', 'always', 'prefer', 'shame', 'Losers', 'view', 'winner', 'vastly', 'superior', 'action', 'spectacle', 'comedy', 'character', 'study', 'story', 'certainly', 'manner', 'fun', 'comic', 'book', 'violence', 'also', 'ambition', 'be', 'more', 'violence', ""'re"", 'engaged', ""'re"", 'actually', 'being', 'told', 'something', 'left', 'theater', 'feeling', 'not', 'empty', 'sad', 'had', 'Kick-Ass', 'energized', 'entertained', 'satisfied', 'instead', 'how', 'movies', 'are', 'supposed', 'make', 'feel', 'right', 'first', 'time', 'what', 'felt', 'like', 'ages', 'was', 'confident', 'had', 'gotten', 'money', 'worth.Based', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'created', 'Andy', 'Diggle', 'Losers', 'Bolivia', 'where', 'find', 'five', 'tough', 'CIA', 'agents', 'mission', 'take', 'out', 'ruthless', 'drug', 'lord', 'compound', 'are', 'Jake', 'Jensen', 'hacker', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'Cougar', 'Alvarez', 'long-distance', 'sniper', 'Oscar', 'Jaenada', 'Pooch', 'Porteous', 'pilot', 'Columbus', 'Short', 'William', 'Roque', 'second', 'command', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'team', 'leader', 'Franklin', 'Clay', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'When', 'mission', 'wrong', 'death', 'twenty-five', 'innocent', 'children', 'five', 'men', 'realize', ""'ve"", 'been', 'set', 'up', 'mysterious', 'figure', 'known', 'only', 'Max', 'vow', 'have', 'revenge', ""'re"", 'longer', 'CIA', ""'re"", 'Losers.They', ""'ve"", 'officially', 'been', 'declared', 'dead', 'U.S.', 'leaving', 'stranded', 'Bolivia', 'money', 'way', 'get', 'home', 'Then', 'Aisha', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'who', 'repeatedly', ""n't"", 'quite', 'what', 'Clay', 'steak', 'seedy', 'dive', 'least', 'subtle', 'ways', 'retreat', 'hotel', 'room', ""n't"", 'end', 'way', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Long', 'story', 'short', 'where', 'Max', 'can', 'get', 'Losers', 'home', 'Clay', 'immediately', 'taken', 'Pooch', 'Cougar', 'Jensen', 'are', 'willing', 'go', 'along', 'Roque', 'however', ""n't"", 'convinced', 'sold', 'idea', 'revenge', 'Max', 'do', 'get', 'game', 'live', 'rest', 'life.And', 'speaking', 'Max', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'place', 'twice', 'always', 'travelling', 'world', 'making', 'deals', 'shady', 'people', 'own', 'equally', 'shady', 'purposes', 'What', 'scheme', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'one', 'coolest', 'terrorist', 'weapons', 'ever', 'conceived', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptation', 'How', 'fitting', 'man', 'most', 'extraordinary', 'sense', 'humor', 'always', 'sarcasm', 'dry', 'wit', 'homicidal', 'tendencies', 'God', 'wind', 'should', 'accidentally', 'blow', 'aside', 'umbrella', ""'re"", 'holding', 'head', 'Funny', 'oh', 'so', 'bad', 'Max', 'most', 'deliciously', 'evil', 'movie', 'villain', 'Colonel', 'Hans', 'Landa', 'Inglourious', 'Basterds', 'Great', 'humor', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'found', 'Losers', 'especially', 'Jensen', 'who', 'not', 'having', 'seen', 'time', 'devoted', 'niece', 'school', 'Soccer', 'team', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'scene', 'must', 'improvise', 'way', 'escape', 'security', 'guards', 'Miami', 'office', 'building', 'little', 'help', 'Cougar', 'have', 'telekinetic', 'abilities', 'ability', 'shoot', 'bullets', 'nothing', 'pointed', 'fingers', 'enjoy', 'Journey', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Stop', 'Believin', 'so', 'too', 'director', 'Sylvain', 'White', 'seeing', 'strategically', 'playing', 'more', 'intense', 'actions', 'sequences', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'horrible', 'fit', 'actually', 'quite', 'amusing.And', 'Clay', 'Aisha', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'pleasure', 'look', 'subplot', 'also', 'very', 'intriguing', 'probably', 'are', 'troubled', 'characters', 'goals', 'mind', 'able', 'reach', 'other', 'one', 'help', 'know', 'awfully', 'overused', 'critical', 'observation', 'true', 'Morgan', 'Saldana', 'have', 'great', 'onscreen', 'chemistry', 'not', 'merely', 'love', 'interests', 'also', 'occasional', 'adversaries', 'ways', 'even', 'harder', 'achieve', 'more', 'effort', 'actors', 'fight', 'well', 'love', 'well', 'probably', 'fighting', 'generally', 'more', 'realistic.What', 'fun', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'days', 'Sure', 'can', 'spend', 'money', 'Kick-Ass', 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'doing', 'great', 'disservice', 'Losers', 'proof', 'even', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptations', 'can', 'successfully', 'be', 'more', 'mean', 'mindless', 'depictions', 'violence', 'Yes', 'plenty', 'action', 'also', 'plot', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'magnetic', 'are', 'also', 'given', 'depth', 'more', 'evident', 'film', 'final', 'sequences', 'display', 'goofy', 'sweetness', 'found', 'very', 'appealing', 'Obvious', 'work', 'went', 'screenplay', 'Obvious', 'work', 'went', 'whole', 'film', 'When', 'movies', 'come', 'around', 'wonder', 'why', 'many', 'other', 'comic', 'filmmakers', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'little', 'harder']",N/A

The specialists pair up with a mercenary named Aisha (Zoe Saldana is worth a couple of wolf howls), whose motives for stopping Max aren't quite clear, and the group hatches its plot and goes into nonstop action.  Of course the action is over the top and approaches cartoon proportions, but again, it's so much fun.  When shoot-'em-ups really let the lead fly it's cinematic bliss for this immature hombre.Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Chris Evans (who is another memorable character), Idris Elba, Columbus Short, and Oscar Jaenada play the wronged CIA specialists attempting to restore their reputations and even the score; this group has terrific chemistry and the locker room interactions are worth chuckles galore.

There is NO WAY he would have been recognised from the ground. All the man does is looks up in the air and says ""Pooch"". He can't even see into the helicopter.Another character, Jensen was more annoying and cliche'd than entertaining.

The characters are great. The movie is consistently entertaining. The Losers has a hard time living up to these standards. Stuff does blow up, but except for one or two scenes, they don't really have the impact you want. Comedic lines are given. A character is good. And the film lags dearly between all the action. On these aspect, the film mostly fails, but overall, it's entertaining enough. Let's expand on these points, shall we?Stuff Blows Up: By far the most memorable scene is where a motorcycle does an awesome crash into an airplane, and it blows up, and Jeffrey Dean Morgon walks away from it, because let's face it, cool people don't look at explosions. And while the rest of the action isn't as memorable, it still kept me entertained while watching the film.Comedic Lines Are Given: If anything, this film will renew your love for Journey's ""Don't Stop Believing."" Most of the jokes comes from Chris Evans character, but the others on the team do their share of one-liners & amusing dialogues as well. If Jason Patric's character is anything, he's unintentionally funny. How evil is he? He shoots a woman for not holding his umbrella right. I found that amusing. But I'm also a dark and disturbing person apparently.The Characters Are Great: Chris Evans has had a very long streak now of being the best thing in every movie he's ever been in, and this continues in full-force for the Losers. I suppose he actually has a skill, but the movie mostly turns to him for laughs. A sequence in a building featuring Evans caused uproarious laughter in my theater, and other scenes featuring Evans are also great. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is a cool dude, but not a specifically memorable character. Same with the rest of them. They all have their traits, but none except for Evans really stick with you.The Movie is Consistently Entertaining: Here's the problem with movies like these. They have to keep up a great pace so the audience isn't really thinking about what's not happening at this very moment. Why? Because they start asking questions about plot holes, or ""Why are these characters even here?"" The space between action may not be as long as I may make it out to be, but the film could have been more easily paced. I could also discuss plot, but hey, are you really watching this movie for plot?Overall, The Losers will make for a good matinee or rental, but not much more.

1312318,AY12DBB0U420B,B002ZG99G8,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","Last night's bargain rack movie was ""The Losers"" DVD. It was one of these nonsense stories involving a death squad, the world's toughest woman, the CIA and a plethora of bad guys and took place in at least a half-dozen countries in the world. Lot's of major and some really spectacular explosions punctuated the story. I'd say the budget was probably pretty high. The action was fast and your mind was always trying to play catch-up and mine never did manage to do so. Here and there the story was actually funny, sometimes in a droll understated way. However, I would not consider it a comedy. Well, maybe it was a comedy considering the looseness of the plot and it's total improbability.I notice a lot of little things in movies. This group of losers flits from place to place in the world on an instant's notice. However, wherever they go everything is completely laid out for them. They always have a car, for example, and it might range anywhere from an aging Pinto to a Hummer, or there's always a jet airplane or helicopter or something fueled and ready to go for them. Secondly, no matter where they go there's always a gun and machine-gun force of bad guys blazing away and trying to do them in. Well, the bad guys are always very bad shots so they mostly end up getting killed in a variety of creative ways and The Losers continue on with the ludicrous story. Do you like a realistic, believable movie or do you prefer unmitigated nonsense that is high action and somewhat entertaining. If it's the latter, then you'll probably enjoy this film.Gary Peterson",3,Fast Action. Big Budget Destruction.

1312321,A328S9RN3U5M68,B002ZG99G8,Grady Harp,"[6, 6]","THE LOSERS is anything but. Created to appear like a comic book in motion, writers peter Berg, James Vanderbuilt and Andy Diggle have come up with a script that has defined some strong, unforgettable characters, outlined an all over the place story line, and managed to polish it all off with just the right amount of parody, humor, steamy scenes, and silly dialogue that makes the movie work.  It is a film highly dependent of pyrotechnics and special effects, but these also are pulled off in such a way that they, too, are entertaining an even set the audience to cheering.The story comes across as a bit jumbled due to the many sites where the action takes place, but essentially it is the tale of a group of five men (CIA operatives) who in an attempt to save some children in a fated helicopter escape from a disaster in Bolivia instead are assumed dead when the report of the exploded helicopter reaches the US.  The five men toss their dog tags into the flaming ruins of the helicopter and thus become lost to the world.  The team is a talented and well trained unit and each of the members has a special identity and gift: Clay (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is the leader (and womanizer), Roque (Idris Alba) is the brains, Jensen (Chris Evans) is the wildly funny guy, Pooch (Columbus Short) is the sensitive guy, and Cougar (&Oacute;scar Jaenada) is the sniper with the ever present hat.  The team (the Losers) becomes the target of a betrayal in dealing with one Max (Jason Patric) who is preparing the bomb to end all bombs.  Out of nowhere comes the mysterious Aisha (Zoe Saldana) who works her way into the group via Clay's attraction to her beauty.  But Aisha has her own agenda and the team joins her in uncovering and hopefully destroying the lethal Max who is planning global warfare.  There are unexpected twists in the plot and internal challenges to the team's structure, but it all comes round in the end.Yes, this is yet another noisy action film with classy acting from not only the stars but from everyone in the large cast.  It is a hoot of an action thriller and hopefully this cast will be reassembled for a Part II in the future.

Well, I will go a step further and say that most of the action would have had the heroes booted out of 7th grade special ops class immediately e.g. how can a 100 lb female subdue a special ops commando that, besides vastly more experience, is twice her size? Even worse are the swinging round house punches that any beginning middle school boxing class would have laughed at (looks good on film though). That aside, the comic book graphics and freeze frames of people being dispatched was just cheap-looking filler. And, the doomsday device looked-like and acted-like a garbage disposal in the sink except the garbage was an entire island. On the positive side, that doesn't leave an environmental mess.

1312324,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B002ZG99G8,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[4, 5]","- Jensen (facing off against three armed security guards): ""As the ancient Tibetan philosophy states, 'Don't start none... won't be none.'""When a covert Special Forces op in Bolivia goes horribly south and they get framed for the murder of 25 Bolivian children, the Losers go rogue. Of course, it simplifies things that they're believed to be deceased. Languishing in Bolivia, destitute in Bolivia, the Losers run into the stunning Aisha, and she's their ticket back to stateside and also the means to achieve get-back on the bent CIA spook who set them up (the degenerate's name is ""Max""). ""Suicide mission"" just might be understating things.Comparisons to THE A-TEAM are inevitable (especially with THE A-TEAM remake coming out the same year), so I thought I'd mention that and be done with it. THE LOSERS is based on a comic book series off DC Comics' Vertigo line, which meant that it was a bit more edgy than your typical DC stuff. (Or maybe what I meant was that it didn't cater to the normal superhero sensibilities.) This story is adapted from the comic book's first arc ""Ante Up,"" which I barely recollect except that the cast does such a good job that I'm sort of compelled to unearth my old LOSERS comic books and re-read.It really is all about the cast. The story works off that run-of-the-mill ""Let's Get Payback On That Bad Guy What Done Set Us Up"" theme. It's shallow storytelling and stocked with plot reverses and double crosses, with snappy edits and hi-octane, over-the-top action sequences. The shifts in locales come with blurring speed, the story definitely globe trots, and so there's a bit of that disorienting factor for the viewer (or maybe the story convolutes that much). But the cast fuels the story, stamps it with a sense of cool, crackles it with energy. The cast is entirely compatible with their just-us-guys camaraderie (which Saldana then folds herself into). Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the team's leader Colonel Clay exhibits a world-weariness, and I don't know if he achieves that thru acting or because he's stubbled for the entire film, but it works. The charismatic Idris Elba is Roque, the second-in-command, and he becomes the catalyst for one of the film's sub-plots. Roque calls Clay's leadership skills into question. Things go downhill when Aisha shows up because Clay has had this history for having the most suspect taste in relationships with da ladies.Of all the folks here, the most highly profiled are Zoe Saldana and Chris Evans, and they get meaty roles. Zoe Saldana is talented and exudes the hotness of a thousand exploding suns. She plays Aisha, the volatile, assskicking operative who hooks up with the Losers because they share the same agenda (which is ruining Max's day, shortening Max's life). I thought Chris Evans was fantastic and often funny as Jensen, the Losers' resident wise-cracking comms & tech expert. Evans without a doubt garners the most dialogue; his patter is non-stop. His T-shirts are ridiculous. He faithfully roots for his little niece's soccer team, the Petunias. I particularly love his use of Journey's ""Don't Stop Believing"" and then his telekinetic bit. Awesome.We all know a good villain elevates the film. Sometimes I'm not sure what constitutes a good villain. The film's Big Bad, Max, is one of those sorts who doesn't really lift a finger, doesn't get his hands dirty. But Jason Patric plays Max in such a wicked condescending way that he steals pretty much all the scenes, especially when sharing those scenes with the stiff Holt McCallany (who plays his right hand man, Wade). Maybe a villain is validated by how much you want him to get what's coming to him. I really wanted Max to get his. It's a little show tune to describe Patric's performance as ""delicious,"" but what the ef. Call it as you see it.Not that the film spends too much time dwelling on it, but I think Max's destructive weapon of the day may have been something called a sonic dematerializer. His scheme revolves around instigating a hi-tech global war. Max is a tool.Maybe my strongest quibble is that Holt McCallany's Wade doesn't really demonstrate why he's got this rep as a bad mofo. There's a good bit about Max ordering him to hire an eighteen-man kill squad but then Max changes his mind and orders Wade to kill the kill squad.- Max: ""What's the matter? You related to them?""- Wade: ""Actually, one of them, yeah.""- Max: ""Really. By blood?""- Wade: ""A brother-in-law. I said I'd kill him.""That pretty much sums up Wade's big badasss moment. The rest of the time, he just stands around, not living up to his street cred.This is a cool movie, flashy and frenetic and snappy banter-full. It might even be worth purchasing.

I was even MORE dubious when I heard it was rated PG-13. While the film version of The Losers lacks alot of the intelligence and biting satire of it's source material it very much keeps the high-energy and colorful personalities which made the comic so much fun to begin with.The story in this film version of The Losers is very much an adaption of the story 'Ante-Up' from the comic (the first six issues). Basically following a close-knit group of soldiers as they attack, rob and take revenge on the people who betrayed them (namely the CIA and a man known as 'Max') . There are alot of embellishments from the comic ranging from the mundane ( Pooch is ALOT younger, Aisha is more friendly, Clay never smokes) to the more obvious (no drug-running CIA, no connections to the Iraq war and the US war on terrorism). What we are left with is a very fun very wacky action film with some great use of locations and action set-pieces. Also this has one of my favorite opening and closing credit sequences with panels by the original comic artist JOCK (mostly taken straight from the comic).The casting is perfect down the line with Chris Evans a stand-out as the scene-stealing Jensen. While the movie does lack alot of the 'name' actors of alot of comic book films (which is probably why it's getting ho-hum publicity and release) the Losers very much holds it's own from beginning to end and it's actors are having fun and making the most of it.The DVD release of this film has a decent transfer and looks better than you'd expect on the small screen but the extras are lacking. I was hoping for some interviews with comics creaters Andy Diggle and Jock (they WERE brought onto the set at several points) but the only extra we get is a look at the film and cast with Zoe Saldana. It's a decent enought feature but this DVD deserved more.So while this film version of the Losers isn't ideal for comic's fans (and the DVD is lacking in extras), it's a VERY fun movie in it's own right and at a short 98 minutes never wears out it's welcome.

These men promptly (?) escaped their explosive assassination attempt to the Bolivian underground.  Today, still wanted by the CIA and an evil villain named Max, they survive in order to seek revenge and reclaim their lives.  If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, it's too bad; because a mysterious woman has already hooked them up with their ultimate revenge mission, and you CANNOT hire The Losers.Sounds familiar, doesn't it?  It should; it's very close to the A-Team intro (which is a GOOD thing).  The similarities don't end there, as both are a group of former soldiers led by a charismatic figure with an affinity for unwinnable situations, cool behavior, celebratory smoking.  Each team has a lady's man, with the leader being both in The Losers.  Each team engages in high firepower, explosive situations that involved meticulously planned tactics requiring a peculiar amount of fortune.The teams differ, however, in their configuration and purpose.  Whereas the A-Team had a lady's man who appeared to be just that, and a leader who appeared to only lead; that is to say, he managed multiple oddball personalities, The Losers shows each person as an integral part of the team, a specialist in his own field.  This was a positive spin on the ""mercenary group battles the world""-motif.  Additionally, the Loser's ""employer"" is given with a bit more purpose and underlying story, as mysterious Aisha funds and organizes their mission while maintaining her own agenda.This is a hands-off, good time movie.  Explosions, military action, high-tech gadgets, a fairly hot hookup between the film's leads, and fairly awesome special effects make it fun throughout.  Add in a fiery male-female fight scene (ala Mr. and Mrs. Smith), a comically evil villain in Jason Patric (DO NOT drop his umbrella!), a Spanish Justin Long (&Oacute;scar Jaenada), quippy one-liners, and a very short runtime (97 minutes), and the result is an underrated comic book adaptation that entertains yet gets unfairly overlooked.Jason Elin",4,Over-the-top action and adrenaline - an implausible improvement on the implausible A-Team motif,1277251200,"06 23, 2010",2010,2169,"['2010', 'crack', 'Special', 'Forces', 'unit', 'was', 'betrayed', 'government', 'set', 'up', 'mass', 'murder', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'men', 'promptly', 'escaped', 'explosive', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'Bolivian', 'underground', 'Today', 'still', 'wanted', 'CIA', 'evil', 'villain', 'named', 'Max', 'survive', 'order', 'seek', 'revenge', 'reclaim', 'lives', 'have', 'problem', 'one', 'else', 'can', 'help', 'can', 'find', 'too', 'bad', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'already', 'hooked', 'up', 'ultimate', 'revenge', 'mission', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'hire', 'Losers.Sounds', 'familiar', ""n't"", 'should', 'very', 'close', 'A-Team', 'intro', 'GOOD', 'thing', 'similarities', 'do', ""n't"", 'end', 'there', 'are', 'group', 'former', 'soldiers', 'led', 'charismatic', 'figure', 'affinity', 'unwinnable', 'situations', 'cool', 'behavior', 'celebratory', 'smoking', 'team', 'lady', 'man', 'leader', 'being', 'Losers', 'team', 'high', 'firepower', 'explosive', 'situations', 'involved', 'meticulously', 'planned', 'tactics', 'requiring', 'peculiar', 'amount', 'fortune.The', 'teams', 'differ', 'however', 'configuration', 'purpose', 'A-Team', 'had', 'lady', 'man', 'who', 'appeared', 'be', 'just', 'leader', 'who', 'appeared', 'only', 'lead', 'say', 'managed', 'multiple', 'oddball', 'personalities', 'Losers', 'person', 'integral', 'part', 'team', 'specialist', 'own', 'field', 'was', 'positive', 'spin', 'mercenary', 'group', 'world', '-motif', 'Additionally', 'Loser', 'employer', 'given', 'bit', 'more', 'purpose', 'underlying', 'story', 'mysterious', 'Aisha', 'funds', 'mission', 'maintaining', 'own', 'agenda.This', 'hands-off', 'good', 'time', 'movie', 'Explosions', 'military', 'action', 'high-tech', 'gadgets', 'fairly', 'hot', 'hookup', 'film', 'leads', 'fairly', 'awesome', 'special', 'effects', 'make', 'Add', 'fiery', 'male-female', 'fight', 'scene', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'comically', 'evil', 'villain', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'DO', 'NOT', 'drop', 'umbrella', 'Spanish', 'Justin', 'Long', 'Oacute', 'scar', 'Jaenada', 'quippy', 'one-liners', 'very', 'short', 'runtime', '97', 'minutes', 'result', 'underrated', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptation', 'yet', 'unfairly', 'overlooked.Jason', 'Elin']",N/A
1312334,ACEA95FQS1AVP,B002ZG99G8,Jem,"[4, 5]","As an action film, this one is harder to categorize than I expected.  Despite a lot of violence, it has enough camp to keep it from being a hard core action movie like the Expendables, but it's more than a popcorn flick like the Transporter films.  I agree with another reviewer that it's a smart action film, with a familiar storyline but a non-traditional execution.  A band of special ops is betrayed by superiors and want revenge.  The filmmakers use the graphic novel basis to great effect, giving a very stylized presentation.  The film begins with each of the main characters being introduced - the camera pans to and freezes on their face as their name is stamped on the screen; a similar effect occurs when the location changes. In fact, the camera freezes more than a few times during the film to good effect.The acting is top notch.  Other than Jackie Earl Haley's Rorschach, I thought Jeffrey Dean Morgan's Comedian was the best thing going in ""The Watchmen.""  Here, he's also conflicted but staunchly a ""good guy.""  He was totally believable as the leader of this ragtag band of Losers.  And Chris Evans surprised me - happily, there's more to him than eye candy Johnny Storm characters.  Perhaps the biggest surprise was Zoe Saldana.  It wasn't just seeing her kick a@@, she had to hold her own against an entirely male cast and she did just that.I would have given the film four stars but for one thing, the villain.  Max is a strange contradiction; he's utterly ruthless with no regard for life, but also somewhat comical with a ""greatest criminal mind of the century"" mentality.  That was fine for Lex Luther in a film with no visceral violence - but not here.  I'm not sure if it was the actor, or the writing, but he just didn't quite work.  Overall, I think fans of graphic novels-turned films (Sin City, 300, etc), and those looking for a different take on action, will enjoy this.The DVD doesn't offer much in extras.  There's one featurette, ""Zoe and the Losers,"" that discusses Saldana's character and how the actress tackled the role and there's a commentary track.  I would have liked a featurette on the graphic novel and how it was adapted, but considering the film didn't do well in theatres I guess it's better than nothing.

Despite that though the film is always entertaining. Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Watchmen, Supernatural seasons 1-2) probably would have made a better Hannibal than Liam Neeson in the upcoming A-Team movie and he shows why in the Losers by shining in a similar role.I also liked Chris Evans and I think he was surprisingly better here in a cocky and talkative role than he was in the Fantastic Four movies. He's more entertaining in the Losers than he was in those 2 movies as well. I still don't see him as Captain America though, due to that character being less cocky and goofy than anyone Evans has played. Jason Patric is also in good form as the nutty wisecracking villain.My only problem with the Losers is that should have ended the story with one movie. It's a good movie, but I don't see sequels happening, especially due to the not so great Box Office performance.

This year two movies with the same plot and same characters came out with in months of each other,The Losers and The A Team.  The Losers is based on a comic book and the A Team well you know....  When the A Team video comes out I will review it, but of the two, The Losers was the best.  It is grittier and rougher arond the edges and true to its source the comic book. Edgy is the key word here.  The Losers are a no nonsense group of men and woman.  The whole picture is feels harsh , grimy, rough, and delibrately anti slick .The characters are stero typical in many ways,BUT since they are not well known actors/faces they come across fresh and dare I say it ""likeable.""  I am very inpressed with Morgan[Clay] the leader. His character has flaws and he is not always right.  The ""girl"" is truly a badass and that is why during one ""funny"" scene the losers try to kill her.  Oh the ""sex"" scene is really HOT, pun intended.The action is enhanced by the use of different camera angles.  The main thing I want to praise and bring attention to is the use of humor.  Humor in films particularly action movies must never be forced or corny.  It must flow out of the action and usually it is dead pan.

For me, having no expectations is a great thing as it leaves me free to just enjoy the movie. Even though the movie opens with comic book graphics, it still manages to feel fresh. The action scenes are edited in a shaky manner that attempts to raise your excitement with freeze frames that reflect the panel style of the original comic book. Also, The Losers thankfully lacked the family friendly feel that Iron Man and so many movies lately ooze.Overall, it's a fun movie, with an easy to follow sequential plot. Sometimes it's nice to watch a movie you don't have to think about, and you'll get a few chuckles out of it. Plus, the soundtrack is almost another cast member, one that I'm a big fan of. Actually, now that I think about it, the soundtrack uses a bunch of the songs off of the Glee soundtrack.... hmmmm...I learned the following things from this movie:Countries and cities of interest are labeled so as to be easily found from the air.The man in charge can often be identified by a sports or suit jacket. 2nd in command may wear a vest.A helicopter and a magnet can pick up a heavy armored truck.When forming an ""offensive perimeter"" people only look up and not 20 feet away.Geeky guys always wear interesting T-shirts.People who have just had sex walk in slow, stuttering movements.Holt McCallany may be an illegitimate Baldwin brother.Surprisingly, hot chicks lie to hairy guys and double cross them.First person knife fighting is essential to any good plot.The best way to stop a plane is with a flaming motorcycle.You can disarm a bomb by duct taping the detonator.Memorable lines:""I gave you the hit him in the face nod, not the throw him off of the building nod.""""We don't need seat belts, the G Force will hold you in your seat.""""Clay and his unit?

They were ex-United States Army Special Forces personnel branded as war criminals for ""crimes they didn't commit."" The Losers is a lot like that.Oh, there's different actors of course: the guy who looks like George Clooney (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), the guy who looks like Ryan Reynolds (Chris Evans as Jensen), the angry African-American (Idris Elba), and a motley hodgepodge of other stereotypes (the Silent Sniper, the Guy With a Family, the Tough Hot Chick). They are all good soldiers who are also good at what they do, but when a smarmy rich villain (Jason Patrick as Max) tries to eliminate them by blowing up a  helicopter full of children, the team decides to disappear until the Tough Hot Chick (Zoe Saldana as Aisha) gets the old team back together again.There are two good things about this movie.  One is Saldana, who steals every scene she's in.  Tough, emotionally wounded, and with a feline menace that she amply displayed in Avatar, Saldana makes everyone else look like a mumbling gorilla.  The other is Evans, who's miscast as geeky awkward type - he's too good-looking to be convincingly geeky and too quick-witted to be believably awkward, but he nails every scene. If the movie was just about these two The Losers would be winners.But it's not.  Instead, we get a curiously overinvolved villain who shoots his minions when they make a mistake (yawn), a chief henchman who has little to do, a tone that veers from awful (kids blown to bits by a missile) to cheeky (Jensen hilariously fails to infiltrate the villain's corporate office) to unbelievable (THE SPOILERS: who knew sniping a motorcycle could cause it to fly over the head of the hero and smash into an oncoming airplane?). The Losers wants comic-book violence and sensibilities but frequently veers into R-rated territory.The Losers also has grand ambitions of being the beginning of a franchise, so it wraps up exactly nothing: not the villain, not our heroes' plight, and certainly not anything we care about.  Dead children are unavenged, improbable weapons of mass destruction don't go off, and our compensation is seeing Max robbed on a bus.

So what is the purpose of sending five human agents to wage a war against formidable and outnumbering armed guards?  To make a movie?  Saving the children of the drug dealer have never been a noble purpose of government agency working on foreign land.  Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan are few examples.  You will definitely enjoy the dilemmas facing a group of talented and highly skilled secret agents stranded in a foreign place and the fascinating military technology of remote destruction.  But, I wished that the movie maker embarked on a real story of real CIA veterans, since the actors were great and diverse, with fascinating personalities and the technology was there to support an educational real story.Attempting to make Max a vicious and shrewd character invoking anger in the viewer was not bad, except for the idea of purchasing an atomic weapon from some Indian janitors or ridiculing people for what they are.  In no way an obnoxious character like Max would be trusted by a single armed security guard who appeared to have the unfettered loyalty to unpredictable boss.Despite the movie's unconvincing story, its action and fast pace kept my attention all through.

The Losers follows a team of special forces ops (Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Idris Elba, Columbus Short, Oscar Jaenada, and future Captain America Chris Evans) who are looking to get revenge on the evil mastermind (Jason Patric) who betrayed them and wants them dead.  Even with a mysterious new partner (Zoe Saldana) by their side, things don't look to go too well for anyone involved.  At its core, The Losers is fun enough with solid work from Morgan, Saldana, Evans, and Patric especially, though whether or not you're a fan of the comic or not, you'll still find it to be mindless flashy mainstream action that surprisingly pushes the limits of its PG-13 rating.  Still, there are much worse comic book adaptations that you could waste your time on, so in the end, The Losers isn't too bad and a step above being mediocre.

Santa Claus appearing would've been more realistic than that scene at the end, in addition to someone being shot in the legs and strolling around like he was brand new not too long after. One thing that bothers me about action movies is majority of the people in them should've died in Scene 1. With this movie, I could buy into certain people staying alive for so long, but the two mentioned above should've died or at least been crippled.Pros: Everything else. I remember seeing Zoe Saldana and Columbus Short on ""Lopez Tonight,"" and when I heard about the movie, I just went ""Eh."" But after renting it, I LOVED this movie. I rewatched Chris Evans by that elevator scene at least eight times and fell out laughing every single time. Aw man, poor comedy. I loved how slick &Oacute;scar Jaenada's character was. He had that whole dark and quiet type thing going for him. Columbus Short's character would make driver's instructors cry, but I liked how his character could drive ANYTHING. Jeffrey Dean Morgan reminds me of the rough-around-the-edges actor Bruce Willis but physically reminds me of Robert Downey Jr. in the face. I liked that combination. Idris Elba is walking eye candy who always manages to steal the scene in action movies. I liked him better in this movie than in ""Takers,"" too. Zoe Saldana is ALWAYS doing her best in every single movie she's in from ""Guess Who?"" to ""Avatar"" to this film. I just love her as an actress!This movie is what ""Takers"" wasn't.

Here, he oozes sex appeal and looks cool shooting machine guns in a suit. George Clooney, eat your heart out!Saldana, who usually annoys me, is actually likeable as the mysterious Aisha. Her scenes with Morgan sizzle, and she handles the bazooka like a pro!Evans, who will appear in the summer blockbuster, Captain America, is also a big surprise. I've only seen him in the Fantastic Four films, where he came across as bland and smart-alecky. As Jensen, however, it became clear why he won the coveted role of Captain America.There's a scene where he sings and dances to Journey's Don't Stop Believing, which is hilarious!

1312398,A3BMRSE8N1858V,B002ZG99G8,Terence Allen,"[1, 2]","""The Losers,"" based on the Vertigo/DC Comic, is a rollicking, fast-paced action-comedy film that seems to enjoy itself as much as it wants others to enjoy. Which is not hard since it's extremely entertaining.The Losers are a Special Forces team led by Jeffrey Dean Morgan, famous from being ""The Comedian"" in ""The Watchmen"" movie. His Clay is a tough, no-nonsense type that has a firm grip on his conscience. So when his team is on a CIA-led mission to pinpoint an airstrike location, and children show up unexpected, he puts his and his team's life in jeopardy to rescue them. The ensuing events make the team international scapegoats. Faking their deaths, the team waits to plan its next move when Clay meets Aisha, who knows who they are and offers them revenge on the CIA official named Max responsible for their plight.The rest of the film follows the team and its twisty, turvy path of vengeance. Morgan channels the roguishness of The Comedian into a decidely more likable and sympathetic character. Zoe Saldana, who plays Aisha, has the appropriate air of toughness, vulnerability, and mystery to fuel her character. The rest of the team rounds out with Idris Elba as Roque, the second-in-command, Chris Evans as Jensen, the silly jokester always coming on to women, Columbus Short as Pooch, who struggles with being thought of as dead as his wife is close to giving birth to their child, and Oscar Jaenada as the taciturn sniper Cougar. Jason Patric makes the most of his villainous turn as Max.The movie is loud, boisterous, funny, exciting, and silly.

End Credits, Peter Berg and James Vanderbilt, Co-Producers or was it Screenwriters of The Losers, same guys who did The Rundown! that's why it felt so familiar and that is why this movie is a nice companion piece to The Rundown.Anyways with that out of the way, this is a briskly paced, fun, high energy movie with cool characters, nice action sequences, nifty soundtrack, except my only problems, why I give it 3 stars.... Jason Patric as the baddie?

To be honest, I couldnt remember if it was it or it was The Expendables in my DVD list, so perhaps they were even lower.  Couple that with the fact it was based on a comic (and I'm not comic-hatin', believe me, I am however in general comic-movie-adaptation-hatin') and I was prepared with finger poised on the stop button.There really is no ""down-time"" in The Losers.  It starts running from minute 1, and pretty much goes full steam until minute 97.  I've always felt that, for the most part, if you can't say what you came to say in 90 minutes, you better have a great reason, and most movies do not.  The Losers doesnt have much to say, so perhaps this explains the brevity, but for pure escapist fun, its hard to beat.Far smarter than the promos would've led you to believe, this movie revels in its own wit and fast-moving humor as much as it does it's McG-style action editing, which did on occasion get a little old.  We've seen this type all before, and its been done slicker and harder (see: Smokin' Aces).  Still, that stop-motion CGI action has impact, and when combined with truly sharp acting (Jeffery Dean Morgan, in his usual subdued cool as well as Jason Patric playing the nut he probably is in real life), there is rarely a dull moment.At the end of the day, I watch a lot of movies, but buy relatively few anymore.  Most have solid qualities, but little replay value.

The movie is based on a comic book, and the story seems to prepare us for the upcoming ""The A-Team"" adaptation. The movie has it's action packed moments and plenty of laugh-out loud moments also. Of all the leads in this movie, it was Chris Evans who stole the show and provided some comic moments in the movie.  In some scenes, you can almost predict when there will be a car blast, when someone will get shot and when the lead star will save the day. ""The Losers"" delivers about what you'd expect and has some tricks up its sleeve which makes it worth checking out.",4,The Losers,1274227200,"05 19, 2010",2010,617,"['have', 'admit', 'movie', 'was', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'story', 'prepare', 'upcoming', 'A-Team', 'adaptation', 'movie', 'action', 'packed', 'moments', 'plenty', 'laugh-out', 'loud', 'moments', 'also', 'leads', 'movie', 'was', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'who', 'stole', 'show', 'provided', 'comic', 'moments', 'movie', 'scenes', 'can', 'almost', 'predict', 'when', 'will', 'be', 'car', 'blast', 'when', 'someone', 'will', 'get', 'shot', 'when', 'lead', 'star', 'will', 'save', 'day', 'Losers', 'delivers', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'tricks', 'up', 'sleeve', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",N/A
1312407,AWRGM17GTMND8,B002ZG99G8,"Tyler S. ""Super-Review""","[0, 1]","What works:  Fine performances by Idris Elba, Zoe Saldana, Columbus Short, and Chris Evans.  They sell the movie to me, when the other actors can't.  The stylized action is good for the most part, and pieces of the script are rock solid.  The general feel of the movie is fun, without taking itself too seriously or too silly.What doesn't work: Source material was already bad, and unfortunately the movie doesn't make it that much better.  Jeffrey Dean Morgan gives a lazy performance as does Max the villain.  Having this unthreatening comedian play the villain, put a major damper on the suspense.  Some of the one-liners are embarassing.  And while the action scenes as a whole are entertaining, the gunfights are less than exciting.There's loads more good and bad things about this film, but generally it stands mediocre.  It wasn't a great comic, and that may be why it's not a great film.  If you're an espionage fan, this may interest you more, but as a common moviegoer, it doesn't do a whole lot for me.  With a better lead and villain, this film may have became a favorite of mine.  It didn't have a lot going for it, and it didn't make the best of it.",3,Pros Equal Cons,1288828800,"11 4, 2010",2010,1163,"['What', 'Fine', 'performances', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'Columbus', 'Short', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'sell', 'movie', 'when', 'other', 'actors', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stylized', 'action', 'good', 'most', 'part', 'pieces', 'script', 'are', 'rock', 'solid', 'general', 'feel', 'movie', 'fun', 'taking', 'too', 'seriously', 'too', 'silly.What', ""n't"", 'work', 'Source', 'material', 'was', 'already', 'bad', 'unfortunately', 'movie', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'better', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'lazy', 'performance', 'Max', 'villain', 'Having', 'unthreatening', 'comedian', 'play', 'villain', 'put', 'major', 'damper', 'suspense', 'one-liners', 'are', 'embarassing', 'action', 'whole', 'are', 'entertaining', 'gunfights', 'are', 'less', 'loads', 'more', 'good', 'bad', 'things', 'film', 'generally', 'mediocre', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'comic', 'may', 'be', 'why', 'not', 'great', 'film', ""'re"", 'espionage', 'fan', 'may', 'interest', 'more', 'common', 'moviegoer', ""n't"", 'do', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'lead', 'villain', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'became', 'favorite', 'mine', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'going', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'best']",N/A
