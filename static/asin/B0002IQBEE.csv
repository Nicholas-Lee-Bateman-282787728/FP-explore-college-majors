My son was not even thrilled with the movie itself (compared to their 123).  He looks bored and does a lot of yawning to this.  He'd ask for his WTP 123 instead. They just touched on very few letters, which doesn't even emphasize on them well.  The Leap Frog Letter Factory is so much better.  I would not recommend this especially for beginners.  They might think that's all what the alphabet is about.  Don't get this.  Get the Leap Frog's version instead.  But if your child adores Winnie the Pooh so much, get the 123 instead.  A 3-star for some great credits like the animations & sounds.",3,Not what we expected.

835548,ARJIAB8SLWAOU,B0002IQBEE,"George Buttner ""Agent0042""","[12, 14]","""Winnie the Pooh ABC's"" is an original Winnie the Pooh story designed to teach rhyming, words and letters. Rather than straight, rote learning, this is presented in the form of a half-hour adventure. Things all get started when Christopher Robin introduces Pooh to a book of rhymes about the characters in the Hundred Acre Woods. Christopher Robin lets Pooh borrow the book and soon Pooh and all of his friends are learning about rhymes, words, reading and the alphabet, with some help from wise old Owl.One of the major complaints about this movie seems to be that it only introduces a few letters. If this is a concern for you or your child, then I recommend making sure you get the DVD version and not the video. It has a wonderful special feature that goes through the alphabet thoroughly, having the characters teach each letter in both upper and lower-case and associated words. Adults will probably get bored with this pretty quickly, but it'll be dead useful for your kid(s). There's also an ABC song with scenes from ""The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" that's quite worthwhile.Overall, if you want your kids to learn the alphabet, or just wanna see another good Pooh story, I'd say you can't go wrong with this, especially if you get the DVD version. Also included on the DVD version is a Fast-Play option and previews for movies such as ""Mulan II"" and ""Pooh's Heffalump Movie,"" as well as the original trailer both this and the 123s video / DVD.Was there anything else I wanted to say?

It focuses mostly on words and rhyming. This might be good for older children, but not for a two year old and not for a parent that wanted something to teach letters.The bonus song was the only part I could admit to hitting the target, but it's very short (2 or 3 minutes) and there are only so many times you can put it on repeat before you want to tear your hair out.I purchased this DVD after falling in love with the Shapes and Sizes DVD, which is also from Disney's Learning Adventures. The difference is night and day. (I also own the 123s, which is also tremendously better than this disc).If you want to help your child learn letters (and even the sounds the letters make), go with the LeapFrog Letter Factory disc.
