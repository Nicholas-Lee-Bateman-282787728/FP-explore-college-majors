I know it's an older movie, but even in it's time, it just had to be a spoof. Both the script and the acting are soooo corny and bad, it just had to be.  Randy Quaid's character had an especially bad script.  And the exaggerated stupidity of the villain's goons was hilarious.  It's like an old 60's beach party/racing movie, gone bad. The young Charlie Sheen's role as the Wraith was also delightfully corny.  It deserves the R rating for violence, adult situations, language and nudity. It is definitely worth the watch if you're in the mood for a good groaner.

It is the black car that survived every time in a race after the loser heads for an inevitable crash. I wanted to view the movie again and see if it got better over time. Sadly, no. The plot, albeit a very interesting one, is very minimal, and it gets real boring after getting know the characters for a few minutes. Then, the same pattern repeats until each of them is dead. Same goes for the scenes. It's just a cycle of races with a different character and a different car each time. The result is as predictable as it gets. And that's about it of the movie. Charlie Sheen is lucky to escape the film because he had the best character that was mysterious and intriguing who happened to have the best looking car.

I just remembered a back-from-the-dead-character in some kind of space-like suit, a car, several fiery race challenges and most of all some revenge for a grievous wrong. For a while it would pop in and out of my head and id try to remember more about it to no avail. Then one day on a movie buying spree here I typed in ""80's Movies"" (I know, I know Crazy right?) in the search box under Movies & TV and proceeded to scroll through the multiple pages that popped up. Finally I saw this title and thought hmmm maybe thats it. So clicking on the link I read about it. Seeing that Charlie Sheen was in it I almost didnt buy it but I saw someones comment that you dont really see HIM all that often because usually hes in some space-like-suit or in the car so I bought it. Im glad I did, It reminded me of how good Charlie used to be before he became a ""Winner"". Yeah it was an 80's movie so maybe the acting wasnt that great to begin with to some people but it was pretty refreshing in my oppinion. Hopefully he can get his life back on track if he hasnt already and be a REAL winner.I wont really get into the movie because others already have and it would be repeating, so Ill just add that its a tale about love, loss and revenge basically.

If your a fan of the movie, or not, I would recomend buying it.Don't get me wrong, the clean up on the film is astounding, but thats all you get.  The fun of DVD's for the most part is all the extra s@*t you get.  More often than not, I enjoy watching those more than the movies themselfs.  My theory is, that this company put out a generic release to see what the response would be, and maybe if its strong enough they might do a 'special edition' of the film.

198117,A1OYNQNK3ZM5QB,6300180263,J. Meeley,"[0, 0]","This film is the epitome of 80's cheesiness. You've got fast cars, hot chicks, a revenge-fueled plot and Clint Howard (with one of the funniest hairdos ever). Yet, the film has a certain charm that makes you kind of enjoy the spectacle of it all.Charlie Sheen plays the lead hero, bent on getting back at the gang who murdered him. That's pretty much as far as the script goes, as far as advancing any kind of plot. This of course, leaves many unanswered questions, as a result. Why is Sheen's character given this second chance for revenge? Why race each gang member separately, when he could kill them all at once? Where are all the adults (save the sheriff, played by Randy Quaid)? Why are the police so inept at stopping things, when they know who the street-racing punks are? It seems providing such answers was never a big priority, as most of the film is spent with cars racing (and blowing up), or Sheen's character reconnecting with his old girlfriend. It is obvious that this film is trying to appeal to the 16-20 year old crowd (and adults who still think like them).Sherilyn Fenn, who plays said girlfriend, provides the prerequisite nudity and damsel in distress required for the story, while Nick Cassavetes is equally adequate as the slimy and somewhat unstable gang leader. Most of the performances are very stiff and wooden, with little in the way of any realistic dialog or emotion. Very typical of an 80's schlock affair, such as this.The two areas the film does excel in, however, are the car races and the soundtrack. The cinematography of the cars battling for the dominance of speed are very well done. It is about the only part of the film that will inspire any thrills, which shouldn't be surprising, as some of the crew were killed during the making of some of those scenes. Then, of course, the soundtrack is simply rocking, with some of the biggest metal bands and artists providing that trashy 80's sound. The races and music help the film to keep the pace moving fast, which is probably for the best, as it helps make it more enjoyable and keeps you from focusing on the lack of plot and acting ability.In the final analysis, &#34;The Wraith&#34; is simply a blend of the average revenge-fantasy and the superficial coolness of youth. Think &#34;Death Race 2000&#34; meets &#34;Death Wish,&#34; only with an 80's vibe. It's actually pretty harmless fun, if you allow yourself to simply give in to the sheer inanity of the premise and don't expect everything to make sense. It's a decent way to kill some time, with the empty kind of thrills the 80's usually provided.",4,Classic 80's trash cinema!,1272844800,"05 3, 2010",2010,2597,"['film', 'epitome', '80', 'cheesiness', ""'ve"", 'got', 'fast', 'cars', 'hot', 'chicks', 'revenge-fueled', 'plot', 'Clint', 'Howard', 'one', 'funniest', 'hairdos', 'ever', 'film', 'certain', 'charm', 'kind', 'enjoy', 'spectacle', 'Sheen', 'lead', 'hero', 'bent', 'getting', 'back', 'gang', 'who', 'murdered', 'pretty', 'much', 'far', 'script', 'as', 'far', 'advancing', 'kind', 'plot', 'course', 'many', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'result', 'Why', 'Sheen', 'character', 'given', 'second', 'chance', 'revenge', 'Why', 'race', 'gang', 'member', 'separately', 'when', 'could', 'kill', 'once', 'Where', 'are', 'adults', 'save', 'sheriff', 'played', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'Why', 'are', 'police', 'so', 'inept', 'stopping', 'things', 'when', 'know', 'who', 'street-racing', 'punks', 'are', 'providing', 'such', 'answers', 'was', 'never', 'big', 'priority', 'most', 'film', 'spent', 'cars', 'racing', 'blowing', 'up', 'Sheen', 'character', 'reconnecting', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'obvious', 'film', 'trying', 'appeal', '16-20', 'year', 'old', 'crowd', 'adults', 'who', 'still', 'think', '.Sherilyn', 'Fenn', 'who', 'said', 'girlfriend', 'prerequisite', 'nudity', 'damsel', 'distress', 'required', 'story', 'Nick', 'Cassavetes', 'equally', 'adequate', 'slimy', 'somewhat', 'unstable', 'gang', 'leader', 'Most', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'stiff', 'wooden', 'little', 'way', 'realistic', 'dialog', 'emotion', 'Very', 'typical', '80', 'schlock', 'affair', 'such', 'this.The', 'two', 'areas', 'film', 'excel', 'however', 'are', 'car', 'races', 'soundtrack', 'cinematography', 'cars', 'battling', 'dominance', 'speed', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'only', 'part', 'film', 'will', 'inspire', 'thrills', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprising', 'crew', 'were', 'killed', 'making', 'scenes', 'Then', 'course', 'soundtrack', 'simply', 'rocking', 'biggest', 'metal', 'bands', 'artists', 'providing', 'trashy', '80', 'sound', 'races', 'music', 'help', 'film', 'keep', 'pace', 'moving', 'fast', 'probably', 'best', 'make', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'focusing', 'lack', 'plot', 'acting', 'ability.In', 'final', 'analysis', '34', 'Wraith', '34', 'simply', 'blend', 'average', 'revenge-fantasy', 'superficial', 'coolness', 'youth', 'Think', '34', 'Death', 'Race', '2000', '34', 'meets', '34', 'Death', 'Wish', '34', 'only', '80', 'vibe', 'actually', 'pretty', 'harmless', 'fun', 'allow', 'simply', 'give', 'sheer', 'inanity', 'premise', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'everything', 'make', 'sense', 'decent', 'way', 'kill', 'time', 'empty', 'kind', 'thrills', '80', 'usually', 'provided']",N/A

Following in the line of Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart, Clint Howard gives the performance of a lifetime in his long and prestigious career.It seems someone was murdered while having sex. His dead body is resurrected as motorcycle riding Charlie Sheen. Charlie wants revenge against the gang that murdered him. The gang is lead by a 30 looking year old man who who has a thing for switchblades. His gang memebers with interesting names like 'Skank' (who enjoys huffing WD-40 and drinking brake fluid), and 'Gutterboy' like to race cars and cheat to win. Apparantly they stop cars, hold women hostage, and force people to drag. The gang cheats at the races, so you wonder why they even bother to race at all. It would be much easier just to carjack people. But then again, playing Ozzy Osbourne's song 'Secret Loser' is much better to listen to during a high speed highway drag race.But what people should really focus on here is Clint Howard and his Flock of Seagulls haircut. He starts every race, and is the mad scientist auto mechanic. I do not know why he did not get the starring role, but the producers picked Charlie Sheen instead for some reason.So you get high speed races and chases, wanton destruction, explosions, a shotgun barrel that blows apart like in a Bugs Bunny cartoon, and the most important thing of all, 1980s Boobies!!!!!

What makes this work is that it's essentially a buddy picture crossed with revenge and romance overlayed with a genre of SciFi, the return of the dead. There is a substantial, believable plot-good guy get killed by gang and returns, not quite as himself, to settle the score, to protect his lady and sustain a young kid who comes to believe in dignity and honor. Sheen has a natural way of underplaying performances which is just what his &#34;Jake&#34; requires. No squinting of brow, no shaking of fist at evil doers, just a cold, very determined handsome face come to settle the score. Perhaps my favorite character is the Sheriff played by Randy Quaid who has dual emotions about the sudden carnage that comes to his county; On the one hand, death is death ande has to be investigated but...dislike of the suddenly deceased doesn't break his heart so his &#34;search for the truth&#34; is rather cursory.

This group of punks are almost pimply faced bullies who band together for strength and have to stay that way as their numbers are picked off. There's an aura of-almost-believability about this that grows more pervasive as you pull for the good guy, wish he could get his girl friend back, all the while littering the highway-and a garage-with corpses; Something for everyone not to forget one of the slickest cars ever put in a film. Makes the Batmobile look like a tricked up entry in a parade and has all the appropriate zoom you might want. Twenty plus years after it was made it hasn't really aged-the rural setting helps that as does costuming that suggests everyday folks who shop at J.C. Penney's more than fashion statements. Though Sheen isn't on the screen as much as one might expect, the excellence of his performance, not to mention the script and the direction, keep him as a presence, much as a Wraith is, through out.

198136,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,6300180263,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","There are some movies that stand the test of time. And then there are movies like THE WRAITH that don't necessarily stand the test of time so much as transport viewers back to a different time. In this case, that time is the mid to late eighties when mediocre pop music, big pants and spiked hairdos were the norm.At its heart THE WRAITH is a revenge flick, but that doesn't become apparent at the start. The film begins with a group of car thieves who pretend to outrace their ""opponents"" to take their cars from them. The leader of the gang is Packard Walsh (Nick Cassavettes, son of John Cassavettes and currently a noted film director in his own right), your stereotypical tough guy. He has to be a bad guy, he wears a black leather jacket!Packard is definitely a psycho, though you rarely see him kill anyone. Instead, he threatens a lot. Packard's gang is a group of misfits that include wanna be tough guy actor Griffin O'Neal (son of Ryan O'Neal) as Oggie, David Sherrill as the spiked haired Skank, Jamie Bozian as mental deficit Gutterboy and Clint Howard as the techno car geek Rughead. How this group could inspire fear is beyond me.But they do. So much so that no one makes an attempt to cross them. This includes the girl of Packard's dreams, Keri Johnson (Sherilyn Fenn). While carry comes when Packard calls, their relationship is not a mutual one but ruled by fear. Keri knows that if she doesn't go with Packard when he calls, someone will be hurt.Enter into this mix a stranger in town named Jake Kesey (Charlie Sheen in an early starring role). Pulling up in front of Keri's house on his motorcycle, the two talk easily but end their conversation when Packard shows. When they see each other again at the local swimming hole, Packard sends two of his gang to keep an eye on Jake.The next time a car falls into their line of fire, Packard and his gang confront a new problem. A slick looking car they can't identify pulls up, ready to take on the challenge for pink slips. Oggie asks to take on the new guy and the race is on. But this car is unlike any other and pulls ahead with ease. So much so that as Oggie comes around a corner after lagging behind, in front of him sits the mysterious black car sideways in the road. Oggie barrels through the car and off a cliff dying in a huge fireball. The black car? Re-materializes and heads down the road.Sheriff Loomis (Randy Quaid) investigates but finds nothing. That is except for the fact that the body of Oggie seems untouched by the fire and has his eyes missing.The story moves on as the mysterious figure decked out in black from head to toe confronts the gang en masse and individually. Each time someone falls and each time more of the story is revealed. Only Rughead knows the truth, that this is no normal person they are racing against but a wraith, an un-avenged spirit who has come to take his revenge.Toss in a romantic link between Keri and Jake as well as Keri and her old boyfriend who disappeared without a trace and you can pretty much guess who is who. But that's not the reason for watching the film. Come on, just who the wraith is should be apparent not far into the film. No, this film is all about the fun of watching actors chew up the screen, of seeing a revenge film play out and of catching a glimpse of what the world was like then. The new film HOT TUB TIME MACHINE kicks its stars back to the past; this movie shows it like it was. Or at least as Hollywood remembers it.Sheen is given little to do here but does a nice job with a slim amount of onscreen time. Fenn is at first unrecognizable and later went on to fame in TWIN PEAKS. Howard actually holds his own here. And Cassavettes offers an evil presence carrying on the family acting tradition.This film is by no means the best thing ever filmed. It is fun though. And perhaps that's why even though it didn't do well at the box office, it garnered a cult following once it hit video tape. Lionsgate has fulfilled those fans dreams by offering the movie now on DVD. It includes a featurette about the making of the movie and the car, known as the Interceptor (which was the foreign title of the film) and an interview with Clint Howard concerning the film. It also features a commentary track by director/writer Mike Marvin who notes that the film in part took ideas from MAD MAX but then inspired a film like THE CROW.Revenge flicks are a genre unto themselves and rarely go out of style. Films like NEVADA SMITH, DEATH WISH, DEATH SENTENCE, ROLLING THUNDER and the upcoming HARRY BROWN all fulfill our need to see revenge upon those who do us wrong played out. Most of us would never consider going through the motions to seek revenge. Until then we'll have to get our fix at the movies. And with films like THE WRAITH not only will we get that revenge but we'll be entertained as well.",4,A DECENT REVENGE FLICK,1269388800,"03 24, 2010",2010,4843,"['are', 'movies', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'then', 'are', 'movies', 'THE', 'WRAITH', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'so', 'much', 'transport', 'viewers', 'back', 'different', 'time', 'case', 'time', 'mid', 'late', 'eighties', 'when', 'mediocre', 'pop', 'music', 'big', 'pants', 'spiked', 'hairdos', 'were', 'norm.At', 'heart', 'WRAITH', 'revenge', 'flick', ""n't"", 'become', 'apparent', 'start', 'film', 'group', 'car', 'thieves', 'who', 'pretend', 'outrace', 'opponents', 'take', 'cars', 'leader', 'gang', 'Packard', 'Walsh', 'Nick', 'Cassavettes', 'son', 'John', 'Cassavettes', 'currently', 'noted', 'film', 'director', 'own', 'right', 'stereotypical', 'tough', 'guy', 'be', 'bad', 'guy', 'black', 'leather', 'jacket', 'Packard', 'definitely', 'psycho', 'rarely', 'see', 'kill', 'anyone', 'Instead', 'lot', 'Packard', 'gang', 'group', 'misfits', 'include', 'wan', 'na', 'be', 'tough', 'guy', 'actor', 'Griffin', ""O'Neal"", 'son', 'Ryan', ""O'Neal"", 'Oggie', 'David', 'Sherrill', 'spiked', 'haired', 'Skank', 'Jamie', 'Bozian', 'mental', 'deficit', 'Gutterboy', 'Clint', 'Howard', 'techno', 'car', 'geek', 'Rughead', 'How', 'group', 'could', 'inspire', 'fear', 'me.But', 'do', 'So', 'much', 'one', 'attempt', 'cross', 'girl', 'Packard', 'dreams', 'Keri', 'Johnson', 'Sherilyn', 'Fenn', 'carry', 'when', 'Packard', 'relationship', 'not', 'mutual', 'one', 'ruled', 'fear', 'Keri', ""n't"", 'go', 'Packard', 'when', 'someone', 'will', 'be', 'hurt.Enter', 'stranger', 'town', 'named', 'Jake', 'Kesey', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'early', 'starring', 'role', 'Pulling', 'up', 'front', 'Keri', 'house', 'motorcycle', 'two', 'talk', 'easily', 'end', 'conversation', 'when', 'Packard', 'When', 'see', 'other', 'again', 'local', 'swimming', 'hole', 'Packard', 'two', 'gang', 'keep', 'eye', 'Jake.The', 'next', 'time', 'car', 'line', 'fire', 'Packard', 'gang', 'new', 'problem', 'slick', 'looking', 'car', 'ca', ""n't"", 'identify', 'pulls', 'up', 'ready', 'take', 'challenge', 'pink', 'slips', 'Oggie', 'take', 'new', 'guy', 'race', 'car', 'other', 'pulls', 'ahead', 'ease', 'So', 'much', 'so', 'Oggie', 'around', 'corner', 'lagging', 'behind', 'front', 'mysterious', 'black', 'car', 'sideways', 'road', 'Oggie', 'barrels', 'car', 'cliff', 'dying', 'huge', 'fireball', 'black', 'car', 'Re-materializes', 'heads', 'down', 'road.Sheriff', 'Loomis', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'nothing', 'fact', 'body', 'Oggie', 'untouched', 'fire', 'eyes', 'missing.The', 'story', 'moves', 'mysterious', 'figure', 'decked', 'out', 'black', 'head', 'toe', 'confronts', 'gang', 'en', 'masse', 'individually', 'time', 'someone', 'falls', 'time', 'more', 'story', 'revealed', 'Only', 'Rughead', 'truth', 'normal', 'person', 'are', 'racing', 'wraith', 'un-avenged', 'spirit', 'who', 'come', 'take', 'revenge.Toss', 'romantic', 'link', 'Keri', 'Jake', 'as', 'well', 'Keri', 'old', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'disappeared', 'trace', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'guess', 'who', 'who', 'not', 'reason', 'watching', 'film', 'Come', 'just', 'who', 'wraith', 'should', 'be', 'apparent', 'not', 'far', 'film', 'No', 'film', 'fun', 'watching', 'actors', 'chew', 'up', 'screen', 'seeing', 'revenge', 'film', 'play', 'catching', 'glimpse', 'what', 'world', 'was', 'then', 'new', 'film', 'HOT', 'TUB', 'TIME', 'MACHINE', 'stars', 'back', 'past', 'movie', 'was', 'least', 'Hollywood', 'remembers', 'it.Sheen', 'given', 'little', 'do', 'here', 'nice', 'job', 'slim', 'amount', 'onscreen', 'time', 'Fenn', 'first', 'unrecognizable', 'later', 'went', 'fame', 'TWIN', 'PEAKS', 'Howard', 'actually', 'own', 'here', 'offers', 'evil', 'presence', 'carrying', 'family', 'acting', 'tradition.This', 'film', 'best', 'thing', 'ever', 'filmed', 'fun', 'perhaps', 'why', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'garnered', 'cult', 'following', 'hit', 'video', 'tape', 'Lionsgate', 'fulfilled', 'fans', 'dreams', 'offering', 'movie', 'now', 'DVD', 'featurette', 'making', 'movie', 'car', 'known', 'Interceptor', 'was', 'foreign', 'title', 'film', 'interview', 'Clint', 'Howard', 'concerning', 'film', 'also', 'commentary', 'track', 'director/writer', 'Mike', 'Marvin', 'who', 'film', 'part', 'took', 'ideas', 'MAD', 'MAX', 'then', 'inspired', 'film', 'THE', 'CROW.Revenge', 'flicks', 'are', 'genre', 'unto', 'rarely', 'go', 'style', 'Films', 'NEVADA', 'SMITH', 'DEATH', 'WISH', 'DEATH', 'SENTENCE', 'ROLLING', 'THUNDER', 'upcoming', 'HARRY', 'BROWN', 'fulfill', 'need', 'see', 'revenge', 'who', 'do', 'wrong', 'played', 'out', 'Most', 'would', 'never', 'consider', 'going', 'motions', 'seek', 'revenge', 'then', ""'ll"", 'have', 'get', 'fix', 'movies', 'films', 'WRAITH', 'not', 'only', 'will', 'get', 'revenge', ""'ll"", 'be', 'entertained', 'as', 'well']",N/A

The sound track is epic ""Where's the fire!"" awsome song, as well as a few others throughout the movie.About the movie: Pretty much a back from the dead revenge story. Yeah some guy gets screwed over by a gang or what ever have you, they take is his loved one from him or something like that, and by some magical force he comes back to life to avenge what has been done wrong to him... yeah yeah yeah seen it seen it.BUT WAIT!This avenger has an unbeatable car as his weapon of choice, and he literally races his victims to death! now how awsome does that sound?All I have to say is this.

Not to mention the divine Sherilyn Fenn in her pre-Twin Peaks day.  The movie opens with something coming from outer space that morphs into a hot car and a costumed driver.  We learn that a gang of punks (led by the irrepressibly vile Nick Cassavettes) have murdered a young man who was messing around with Nick's honey (Fenn).

Luckily, it was a pretty good movie, so it was not such a chore to get through.The plot is basic: new kid moves to town, and gets interested in a local girl, Keri. The local hot rod gang leader also has an interest in her and decides to protect those interests. Jake, the new guy, finds himself on the other side of death with a new machine and serious axe to grind. The revenge starts with challenges to races, and as the gang dwindles, so the panic increases.By today's standards, the effects are on the cheesy side, though that does not entirely detract from the movie's charms. The acting is pretty much what you would expect from a fairly low budget movie, though it is certainly not the worst about.

One thing I didn't like about this film was that you don't see a lot of Sheen in this even though he is the lead actor.The story is a teenager is murdered by a gang. The gangleader is pretty much a psychopath and him and his gang murdered Jamie, the character who dies and comes back as The Wraith.This was probably motivated by jealousy and a possessiveness of Sherilyn Fenn's character who is not interested in the gangleader at all romantically.Charlie Sheen's character Jake, previously Jamie in another life, returns to wreak revenge on the gangleader and his gang, who are illegal car racers.The Wraith challenges them with his prototype Interceptor car and one by one the gang end up dead;their cars a wreck. They should each be burned beyond recognition (the only way to identify them through dental records) but strangely enough they are unburnt and their eyes are missing.The action in this is great, it is one of Sheen's best movies. Standout action scene is where there is a car chase and new cars fall off a semi-trailer onto the road.The special effects are fabulous where The Wraith disappears.

198162,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,6300180263,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[2, 3]","Yet another flick that enjoyed regular circulation on HBO back in the day when HBO had a tendency to play movies instead of eight billion different TV Shows.  If you had HBO back in the 80s and early 90s, you most likely saw this film(or part of it at least) at one time or another.The movie centers around a gang of auto-obsessed thugs in a small Arizona town.  They're led by the psychotic Packerd(Nick Cassavettes), and forcefully challenge kids to participate in backroads auto races, the stakes being the vehicles.  Naturally, Packerd's crew has the deck stacked and the gang tends to walk away with more cars than they lose(in fact, they don't loose any).  They also run a chop shop.  Packerd's sidekicks include a chemical huffing punker, a nerdy mechanical whiz(played by Clint Howard looking like he just stepped out of an audition for Eraserhead where he lost to Jack Nance), a childlike grease monkey, and a few other various schmucks.  In fact, none of them come across as particularly dangerous or threatening except for Packerd.Packerd is obsessed with Keri(Sherilyn Fenn, looking beautiful as always, but not quite to Twin Peaks levels), and will allow no man near her.  She thinks he's a creep, but is more or less forced into a relationship with him.  One night Packerd and his goons find Keri doing the nasty with another local boy, Jamey, and Packerd kills him right then and there.  Fast forward to the present(present being 1986) and a stranger arrives in town in the form of Jake(Charlie Sheen)a motorcycle riding prettyboy.  He immediately starts putting the moves on Keri, and she happily goes googily over him.  Also new in town is a spectral figure in a helmet and driving suit driving a souped up black car with seemingly supernatural properties-The Wraith!!!The Wraith systematically bumps off the members of Packerd's gang by challenging them to their own brand of backroad auto racing.  The Wraith has a tendency to make them crash and burn however.  Boy, I wonder if there's a connection between the murdered Jamey, newcomer Jake and The Wraith!This is a very cool little movie.  Sure folks may chuckle at the very 80s look and fashions, but that's all part of the film's charm.  After all it was made in the 1980s, so of course it will look like it.  It's not heavy on visual FX, but what it does use is actually quite good.  It may be one of Sheen's lesser known films, but it's probably his biggest cult fave.  He's not in the movie too much, nor does he say an awful lot either.  Instead the movie tends to focus more on Cassavettes' evil Packerd, his gang, and his odd and scary relationship with Keri.  In fact, the movie seems to be more of a vehicle(no pun intended) for Cassavettes to become a star.  It never happened, but I must say that Cassavettes is great in this movie.  He truly comes across as very unhinged and very dangerous.  At no point does he ever seem upset, threatened or fazed by The Wraith's taunts.  In one scene, the Wraith storms into his chop shop and blasts the place to pieces with a shotgun, and Packerd barely blinks an eye!  It's definitely an underrated villain performance on par with Timothy Van Patten's psycho teenager in Class Of 1984.Oddly there is no real explanation or background given to the Wraith.  Yeah, we know it's the murdered Jamey back to take revenge, but how?  And is he a ghost?  From outer space(the film's intro scene seems to imply this)?  Why the Car?  The snazzy shotgun?  The outfit?  Well, who really cares anyway?  I like the fact that you're only given enough information to understand what's going on and left to fill in the technical blanks yourself.  More movies should do this instead of trying to spell everything out to an audience who should be able to use their own imaginations and come to their own conclusions.The movie is rated PG-13, but it's an 80s PG-13 which means there's actually a bit of topless nudity here(yes, even a bit from Fenn!).  It really didn't need to be rated anything harder.If you're feeling nostalgic, The Wraith is definitely worth revisiting.  Even if you never saw it back in the day, it's still worth checking out coz it's just a damn good movie!",4,Early Sheen Vehicle(Ha!
