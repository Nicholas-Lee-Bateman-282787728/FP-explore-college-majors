939697,AEYLJQJMFI0ZY,B000BBOUAO,Cynthia Murphy,"[14, 20]","I kept hoping all throughout the entire documentary that Tony and his wife would end up leaving the roman catholic church.  (It was certainly the best thing I ever did, and I was never molested there or mistreated in any way, I just always hated the phony-baloney double standards and outright lies I knew existed even as a kid).  But no, he lets his daughter take part in the first communion thing and spends all that time being in anguish and not turning away from the whole filthy rotten organization, which is what you MUST do if you are honest with yourself in the end.  His wife was not raised a roman catholic and talked briefly about checking out a nondenominational church nearby.  Tony and she would have been embraced there and would possibly have learned some actual bible, which is the only place the truth about Christianity can be found.  The mention of the fact that a bishop is allowed and will lie to ""protect"" the catholic church cinches it for me - it's nothing but an organization of lies and always has been!  And Tony said to his mom in effect that to be part of such a thing after getting the truth is to be in collaboration with it.  Amen.  Yet people stay in it because they think some other man (a priest, no matter how flawed he is) has some holy power over them.  Martin Luther was a devout catholic monk who read the book of Romans one day and found a truth that the catholic church does not believe in, that ""the just shall live by faith,"" and he knew he could not be part of the travesty anymore.",5,Good to hear people speak bluntly about what these priests said and did,1154390400,"08 1, 2006",2006,1528,"['kept', 'hoping', 'entire', 'documentary', 'Tony', 'wife', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'leaving', 'roman', 'catholic', 'church', 'was', 'certainly', 'best', 'thing', 'ever', 'did', 'was', 'never', 'molested', 'mistreated', 'way', 'just', 'always', 'hated', 'phony-baloney', 'double', 'standards', 'outright', 'lies', 'knew', 'existed', 'even', 'kid', 'daughter', 'take', 'part', 'first', 'communion', 'thing', 'time', 'being', 'anguish', 'not', 'turning', 'away', 'whole', 'filthy', 'rotten', 'organization', 'what', 'MUST', 'do', 'are', 'honest', 'end', 'wife', 'was', 'not', 'raised', 'roman', 'catholic', 'talked', 'briefly', 'checking', 'out', 'nondenominational', 'church', 'nearby', 'Tony', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'embraced', 'would', 'possibly', 'have', 'learned', 'actual', 'bible', 'only', 'place', 'truth', 'Christianity', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'mention', 'fact', 'bishop', 'allowed', 'will', 'lie', 'protect', 'catholic', 'church', 'cinches', 'nothing', 'organization', 'lies', 'always', 'been', 'Tony', 'said', 'mom', 'effect', 'be', 'part', 'thing', 'getting', 'truth', 'be', 'collaboration', 'Amen', 'people', 'stay', 'think', 'other', 'man', 'priest', 'matter', 'how', 'flawed', 'holy', 'power', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'was', 'devout', 'catholic', 'monk', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'Romans', 'one', 'day', 'found', 'truth', 'catholic', 'church', 'not', 'believe', 'just', 'shall', 'live', 'faith', 'knew', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'part', 'travesty', 'anymore']",Twist of Faith

What is seen insults the sense of decency, appropriateness,  justice: the instance of authority doing in the dark what it would not dare do in the light.History is replete with examples of parents leaving their children exposed to the elements because unwilling to attempt their care.  They have put their children in the service of others, they have apprenticed them, they have put them out to  foster care or day care.  They have trusted public and private institutions with their education.  Our children can be all they can be in the military, even covertly.The church hasn't responded by saying, for example, to make an omelet on must break eggs.  They follow the policy of containing the damage.  Certainly, just continuing to assign likely young priests who seem to have a vocation for it to youth responsibilities seems unwise.Perhaps credibility will not be tested in these areas of dubious service as they once were.  Within the flock of true believers are some whose faith suffices to enable their murder of abortionists.In any case, I am glad that I managed to stay with this difficult film to its conclusion.

939700,A3GYVMUS7SSDFW,B000BBOUAO,Kyle Tolle,"[11, 12]","Tony Comes is a firefighter in Toledo, Ohio.  As a teenager attending Central Catholic High School in the 1980's, he and others were repeatedly molested by priest and religion teacher Dennis Gray.  Later in life when Tony, his wife, and 2 children move to a nice suburban neighborhood in Toledo, they're shocked to find that the serial child molester Dennis Gray now lives only 5 houses away from them on the same street.In June of 2002, Tony met with Toledo diocese bishop James Hoffman to relate his story of sexual abuse.  The bishop lied to Tony and stated that Dennis Gray had molested only him.  Subsequent news reports attested to 6 additional men who reported they were molested by Dennis Gray at the same high school in the same time frame. Several of these victims are interviewed in this program.  In September, Tony filed a lawsuit against the Catholic Church and in December he contacted the media.The Catholic Church is shown to be very uncooperative with the media and attorneys in regards to these sensitive issues.  This becomes clearer when information is discovered that a large, influential law firm working for the church has been silencing victims and quietly settling sexual abuse lawsuits for years all over Ohio.  In fact, the church themselves knew all along about Dennis Gray and even other priests who were abusing children.  The church, bishops, and priests all worked in collusion to cover it up until it was exposed by the media.  Under canon law (the rules by which the Catholic Church lives by) priests are authorized to lie if it's in the best interests of the church to protect it from scandal.In 2004, Tony and 21 other victims talked about a settlement with the Toledo diocese.  Tony was eventually offered a paltry sum of 55,000 dollars which he reluctantly accepted.  Only a few short weeks after this, it was discovered that the Toledo diocese had a stock portfolio worth over 100 million dollars.The actual scope of this abuse perpetrated by priests is massive by any measure of the word.  In a surprising act of honesty and revelation, a study commissioned by the U.S. Catholic Church showed that since 1950, there have been 11,750 reported cases of children who were sexually abused by 5,148 priests in the United States.`Twist of Faith' is a sobering and heartbreaking documentary showing the guilt, pain, and suffering that was endured by Tony Comes and many resulting after effects that caused turmoil in his life and marriage.  This is also a significant look at a legacy of deceit, corruption, and aberrant behavior in several elements of the Catholic Church.",4,A revealing story of religion gone bad,1180051200,"05 25, 2007",2007,2607,"['Tony', 'Comes', 'firefighter', 'Toledo', 'Ohio', 'teenager', 'attending', 'Central', 'Catholic', 'High', 'School', '1980', 'others', 'were', 'repeatedly', 'molested', 'priest', 'religion', 'teacher', 'Dennis', 'Gray', 'Later', 'life', 'when', 'Tony', 'wife', '2', 'children', 'move', 'nice', 'suburban', 'neighborhood', 'Toledo', ""'re"", 'shocked', 'find', 'serial', 'child', 'molester', 'Dennis', 'Gray', 'now', 'only', '5', 'houses', 'away', 'same', 'street.In', 'June', '2002', 'Tony', 'met', 'Toledo', 'diocese', 'bishop', 'James', 'Hoffman', 'relate', 'story', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'bishop', 'lied', 'Tony', 'stated', 'Dennis', 'Gray', 'had', 'molested', 'only', 'Subsequent', 'news', 'reports', 'attested', '6', 'additional', 'men', 'who', 'reported', 'were', 'molested', 'Dennis', 'Gray', 'same', 'high', 'school', 'same', 'time', 'frame', 'Several', 'victims', 'are', 'interviewed', 'program', 'September', 'Tony', 'filed', 'lawsuit', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'December', 'contacted', 'media.The', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'shown', 'be', 'very', 'uncooperative', 'media', 'attorneys', 'regards', 'sensitive', 'issues', 'clearer', 'when', 'information', 'discovered', 'large', 'influential', 'law', 'firm', 'working', 'church', 'been', 'silencing', 'victims', 'quietly', 'settling', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'lawsuits', 'years', 'Ohio', 'fact', 'church', 'knew', 'about', 'Dennis', 'Gray', 'even', 'other', 'priests', 'who', 'were', 'abusing', 'children', 'church', 'bishops', 'worked', 'collusion', 'cover', 'up', 'was', 'exposed', 'media', 'canon', 'law', 'rules', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'priests', 'are', 'authorized', 'lie', 'best', 'interests', 'church', 'protect', 'scandal.In', '2004', 'Tony', '21', 'other', 'victims', 'talked', 'settlement', 'Toledo', 'diocese', 'Tony', 'was', 'eventually', 'offered', 'paltry', 'sum', '55,000', 'dollars', 'reluctantly', 'accepted', 'Only', 'few', 'short', 'weeks', 'was', 'discovered', 'Toledo', 'diocese', 'had', 'stock', 'portfolio', 'worth', '100', 'million', 'dollars.The', 'actual', 'scope', 'abuse', 'perpetrated', 'priests', 'massive', 'measure', 'word', 'surprising', 'act', 'honesty', 'revelation', 'study', 'commissioned', 'U.S.', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'showed', '1950', 'have', 'been', '11,750', 'reported', 'cases', 'children', 'who', 'were', 'sexually', 'abused', '5,148', 'priests', 'United', 'States.', 'Twist', 'Faith', 'sobering', 'heartbreaking', 'documentary', 'showing', 'guilt', 'pain', 'suffering', 'was', 'endured', 'Tony', 'Comes', 'many', 'resulting', 'effects', 'caused', 'turmoil', 'life', 'marriage', 'also', 'significant', 'look', 'legacy', 'deceit', 'corruption', 'aberrant', 'behavior', 'several', 'elements', 'Catholic', 'Church']",Twist of Faith

939703,A1K7X23UDT0R7V,B000BBOUAO,Winston D. Jen,"[0, 0]","Kirby Dick (This Film is not yet Rated) brings us a moving documentary about clerical child rape. Tony Comes and his family are the film's focal point. A 34-year-old firefighter, he is introduced to us at a local primary school in Toledo, Ohio, explaining monsters and firemen (an oxygen mask would scare most children into frozen terror). Cut to a deposition of Dennis Grey, the priest who groomed, raped and terrorized at least half a dozen boys in his cottage alone.The film alternates between the monologues of Tony and his wife Wendy. Wendy was attracted to Tony because of his outgoing and frank nature (Wendy was the polar opposite). Tragically, she converted to Catholicism as an adult, being unaware of the repeated instances of rape her husband went through.The bishop in charge of Tony's diocese claimed that Tony was the only victim, but this was swiftly disproven. The lies, deceit and betrayal is made worse by Tony's own mother, his own flesh and blood, whose maternal love and devotion was torn asunder by the church (she continued to give money each Sunday to the very organization that raped her son).One of the most moving moments of the film are the inaugural annual meeting with SNAP (Survivors Network of those abused by Priests), where child rape victims, now adults, share their experiences of inexcusable and unforgivable breaches of trust. Another is an informal get-together Tony organizes with two othe victims of child rape at the tentacles, mouth, tongue, fingers and genitals of Dennis. The confession that Tony pours forth toward his fellow abuse victims. At 14, Tony was older than most victims, and felt he could have done something to throw a wrench into Dennis' schemes of further abuse.The film ends with a note of tragedy and hope. While Tony received a pittance from the Roman Catholic Church, he and Wendy are still married, despite having seen attorneys to arrange a divorce. I was left wondering whether the Comes are still Catholic (needless to say, I hope they have cut all ties with that wretchedly banal and pernicious institution).",5,Viewers Cannot Forget.
