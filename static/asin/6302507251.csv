316676,A2HP9COIPKXQ1I,6302507251,"B-MAN ""B""","[11, 11]","You remember Ace & Peter, the other two members that were vital in making KISS what it is!  Well, they're not being interviewed on this video or any other so far.  This video receives four stars because of one thing: the classic KISS footage.  It is the best in terms of quantity of the 70's footage available!  The downfall? You have to wade through lots of interview footage of Gene & Paul blaming Ace & Peter and pretty much everyone else besides themselves for problems with the band.  I liked watching this the first couple of times, back when I was naive enough to believe most of it, but now I fast forward through the interviews to get to the make-up footage, which is very cool.  Things I got tired of hearing while watching Extreme Close-up are:1.  Hearing Paul say how Ace's guitar playing stopped ""blossoming"" (a. Ace's 1978 Kiss solo LP sold the most copies, b. Like Paul's playing ""blossomed"" ?, and c. How do you ""blossum"" when your guitar solos are being edited and your allowed 1 to 2 songs an album?)2.  Hearing Gene talk about how Ace created the original KISS logo and then Paul ""refined it"" and how they're still using ""Paul's logo"" today - Give me a break, just say Ace created it!3.  Hearing how Eric Carr ""buried"" Peter Criss as a drummer.  For one, their styles were different, Peter had a funky sound that made songs like ""Parasite"", ""Hotter than Hell"", and ""Strange Ways"" groove as hard as they did and Eric Carr had a hard rock style that gave the ""Creatures of the Night"" album and subsequent albums a kick in the butt.4.  In general, hearing how Ace & Peter were basically self destructive losers who wanted to bring down the band and Gene & Paul are drug-free, consumate professionals.The thing I did like: The classic footage, which is worth owning it for.The classic line up (Ace, Peter, Gene, & Paul) and the make-up and costumes, etc. are why the group has had any success at all.  There success did not start with ""Lick it up"", ""Asylum"", or ""Revenge"", it started with ""Alive!"".  Their influential period began and for the most part ended when Ace Frehley and Peter Criss were officially out of the band.  When people think of  KISS, they're going to think of Ace, Peter, Gene, and Paul.  These four are the reason KISS is what it is.  There should be a video for Ace & Peter to tell their sides of the KISS story for once.  I almost don't care what is true anymore, just show a different point of view for crying out loud.  Buy Extreme Close-up for the footage of KISS in their most influential, exciting, prime: the 1970's, not for the ""truth"" from Gene & Paul.",4,Where's Ace & Peter?,1020384000,"05 3, 2002",2002,2598,"['remember', 'Ace', 'Peter', 'other', 'two', 'members', 'were', 'vital', 'making', 'KISS', 'what', 'Well', ""'re"", 'not', 'being', 'interviewed', 'video', 'other', 'so', 'far', 'video', 'four', 'stars', 'one', 'thing', 'classic', 'KISS', 'footage', 'best', 'terms', 'quantity', '70', 'footage', 'available', 'downfall', 'have', 'wade', 'lots', 'interview', 'footage', 'Gene', 'Paul', 'blaming', 'Ace', 'Peter', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'else', 'problems', 'band', 'liked', 'watching', 'first', 'couple', 'times', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'naive', 'enough', 'believe', 'most', 'now', 'fast', 'forward', 'interviews', 'get', 'make-up', 'footage', 'very', 'cool', 'Things', 'got', 'tired', 'hearing', 'watching', 'Extreme', 'Close-up', 'are:1', 'Hearing', 'Paul', 'say', 'how', 'Ace', 'guitar', 'playing', 'stopped', 'blossoming', 'Ace', '1978', 'Kiss', 'solo', 'LP', 'sold', 'most', 'copies', 'b', 'Paul', 'playing', 'blossomed', 'c.', 'How', 'do', 'blossum', 'when', 'guitar', 'solos', 'are', 'being', 'edited', 'allowed', '1', '2', 'songs', 'album', '2', 'Hearing', 'Gene', 'talk', 'how', 'Ace', 'created', 'original', 'KISS', 'logo', 'then', 'Paul', 'refined', 'how', ""'re"", 'still', 'using', 'Paul', 'logo', 'today', 'Give', 'break', 'just', 'say', 'Ace', 'created', '3', 'Hearing', 'how', 'Eric', 'Carr', 'buried', 'Peter', 'Criss', 'drummer', 'one', 'styles', 'were', 'different', 'Peter', 'had', 'funky', 'sound', 'made', 'songs', 'Parasite', 'Hotter', 'Hell', 'Strange', 'Ways', 'groove', 'as', 'hard', 'did', 'Eric', 'Carr', 'had', 'hard', 'rock', 'style', 'gave', 'Creatures', 'Night', 'album', 'subsequent', 'albums', 'kick', 'butt.4', 'general', 'hearing', 'how', 'Ace', 'Peter', 'were', 'basically', 'self', 'destructive', 'losers', 'who', 'wanted', 'bring', 'down', 'band', 'Gene', 'Paul', 'are', 'drug-free', 'consumate', 'professionals.The', 'thing', 'did', 'classic', 'footage', 'owning', 'for.The', 'classic', 'line', 'Ace', 'Peter', 'Gene', 'Paul', 'make-up', 'costumes', 'etc', 'are', 'why', 'group', 'had', 'success', 'success', 'did', 'not', 'start', 'Lick', 'up', 'Asylum', 'Revenge', 'started', 'Alive', 'influential', 'period', 'began', 'most', 'part', 'ended', 'when', 'Ace', 'Frehley', 'Peter', 'Criss', 'were', 'officially', 'band', 'When', 'people', 'think', 'KISS', ""'re"", 'going', 'think', 'Ace', 'Peter', 'Gene', 'Paul', 'four', 'are', 'reason', 'KISS', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'video', 'Ace', 'Peter', 'tell', 'sides', 'KISS', 'story', 'once', 'almost', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'true', 'anymore', 'just', 'show', 'different', 'point', 'view', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'Buy', 'Extreme', 'Close-up', 'footage', 'KISS', 'most', 'influential', 'exciting', 'prime', '1970', 'not', 'truth', 'Gene', 'Paul']",N/A

316681,A1P2NBM3P3TS2X,6302507251,"John S. Harris ""The Voice of Reason""","[2, 2]","This video interview from 1992 is pretty informative, though Gene and Paul are careful to play it close to the vest about past members of the band.  In some cases only snippets of their videos are shown, but it leaves room for more content that way.  This video was probably the first public step the band had taken up to that point to reveal some of the inner workings and turmoil of the band.  But it is still entertaining, which is the most important point.  Gene and Paul finally admit to some of their missteps in the past, and as expected Vinnie Vincent gets portrayed as ungrateful.  Maybe he was, or maybe he was just so excited about being in a high profile band that his enthusiasm caused his head to swell.  He wouldn't be the first.  But KISS owes a lot to VV, primarily for his songwriting contributions to the band, from 1982's &quot;Creatures of the Night&quot; and 1992's &quot;Revenge&quot;, plus a few other things over the years.  Gene and Paul may be the last to admit that VV, for all his flaws, was as important in keeping KISS alive and well for many years as anybody else in the band.  'Nuff said.At the time this video was produced, KISS' line-up consisted of Gene, Paul, Bruce Kulick, and Eric Singer -- this was probably their strongest line-up musically (give or take one Ace Frehley).  But let Singer's example be a good business lesson to us all -- he maintained an amicable relationship with his former bosses (Gene and Paul) even after he was fired in 1996.  That would serve him well when G&amp;P decided to bring him back into the fold in 2001 when Peter Criss got greedy (again) and was ousted from the remainder of the Farewell Tour.  Just as well for KISS fans - Singer is a FAR superior drummer to Criss.This is a really good video, but if you are expecting complete honesty and disclosure about the band, you may be somewhat disappointed.

316682,A11XKY4EIU2KNR,6302507251,"Johny Bottom ""Insane and lonely guitarist""","[10, 14]","You know what my idea of a great KISS video would be? Get Ace, Peter,  Vinnie, and Mark St. John to do a home video together. They would tell you  more about KISS in five minutes than Gene and Paul did in this video. Gene  and Paul mostly talk about how great it is to be in KISS and that they can  do no wrong. ANy former member that left KISS had nothing to do with Gene  and Paul, it was all their own fault. The only part of this video I enjoy  is all the pre-Bruce footage. Consider the following....1. Paul says  Ace's guitar playing never 'blossomed'. Has Paul ever heard Ace's '78 solo  album? Blossom? That album exploded. How can Ace's guitar playing grow and  blossom if he is forever stifled by Gene and Paul?2. Gene said Vinnie  was &quot;the most destructive individual he ever met. He would hang  himself as you offered him the keys to the kingdom.&quot; Who's offering?  What keys and to what kingdom? Vinnie was never even offered a contract.  Gene cannot admit that without Ace their band was lost and even though he  had huge shoes to fill, Vinnie saved KISS. He co-wrote the best songs on  'Creatures', practically wrote 'Lick it Up' while Gene stuck him in a rat  infested hotel room, and co-wrote the best songs on the 'Revenge' album.  Gene and Paul treated Vinnie like a second class citizen. No wonder he's  suing them.3. Mark St. John, although he only played on one album, was  treated almost as bad as Vinnie. He would drive back and forth between Gene  and Paul's studio to lay down guitar tracks. Like Ace his style was stifled  to accomadate Gene and Paul. Mark didn't get along with either of them (big  surprise), if his hand hadn't gone bad he probably would have left them  soon anyway.4. Bruce and Eric really have nothing of substance to say.  Just that KISS is great and they are real happy to be in KISS. I always  wondered if Gene and Paul told them what to say, or if their interviews  were censored by them in any way.I love KISS music and I love the  original line-up, but Paul and Gene are two people who can also represent  the worst attitudes in rock-n-roll. Never backstab the people who helped  make you what you are today.",4,Gene and Paul are still talking out the side of their mouths,966470400,"08 17, 2000",2000,2171,"['know', 'what', 'idea', 'great', 'KISS', 'video', 'would', 'be', 'Get', 'Ace', 'Peter', 'Vinnie', 'Mark', 'St.', 'John', 'do', 'home', 'video', 'together', 'would', 'tell', 'more', 'KISS', 'five', 'minutes', 'Gene', 'Paul', 'did', 'video', 'Gene', 'Paul', 'mostly', 'how', 'great', 'be', 'KISS', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'ANy', 'former', 'member', 'left', 'KISS', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'Gene', 'Paul', 'was', 'own', 'fault', 'only', 'part', 'video', 'enjoy', 'pre-Bruce', 'footage', 'Consider', 'following', '.1', 'Paul', 'Ace', 'guitar', 'playing', 'never', ""'blossomed"", 'Has', 'Paul', 'ever', 'heard', 'Ace', ""'78"", 'solo', 'album', 'Blossom', 'album', 'exploded', 'How', 'can', 'Ace', 'guitar', 'playing', 'grow', 'blossom', 'forever', 'stifled', 'Gene', 'Paul', '2', 'Gene', 'said', 'Vinnie', 'was', 'quot', 'most', 'destructive', 'individual', 'ever', 'met', 'would', 'hang', 'offered', 'keys', 'kingdom.', 'quot', 'Who', 'offering', 'What', 'keys', 'what', 'kingdom', 'Vinnie', 'was', 'never', 'even', 'offered', 'contract', 'Gene', 'can', 'not', 'admit', 'Ace', 'band', 'was', 'lost', 'even', 'had', 'huge', 'shoes', 'fill', 'Vinnie', 'saved', 'KISS', 'best', 'songs', ""'Creatures"", 'practically', 'wrote', 'Up', 'Gene', 'stuck', 'rat', 'infested', 'hotel', 'room', 'co-wrote', 'best', 'songs', ""'Revenge"", 'album', 'Gene', 'Paul', 'treated', 'Vinnie', 'second', 'class', 'citizen', 'wonder', 'suing', 'them.3', 'Mark', 'St.', 'John', 'only', 'played', 'one', 'album', 'was', 'treated', 'almost', 'as', 'bad', 'Vinnie', 'would', 'drive', 'back', 'forth', 'Gene', 'Paul', 'studio', 'lay', 'down', 'guitar', 'tracks', 'Ace', 'style', 'was', 'stifled', 'accomadate', 'Gene', 'Paul', 'Mark', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'big', 'surprise', 'hand', 'had', ""n't"", 'gone', 'bad', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'left', 'soon', 'anyway.4', 'Bruce', 'Eric', 'really', 'have', 'nothing', 'substance', 'say', 'Just', 'KISS', 'great', 'are', 'real', 'happy', 'be', 'KISS', 'always', 'wondered', 'Gene', 'Paul', 'told', 'what', 'say', 'interviews', 'were', 'censored', 'way.I', 'love', 'KISS', 'music', 'love', 'original', 'line-up', 'Paul', 'Gene', 'are', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'also', 'represent', 'worst', 'attitudes', 'rock-n-roll', 'Never', 'backstab', 'people', 'who', 'helped', 'make', 'what', 'are', 'today']",N/A

I liked it a lot.As I already mentioned in the headline for this review,it does a good job picking up on where the ""Exposed"" video/DVD left off. You get behind the scenes interviews from mostly Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley talking about the history of the band,the fans and other bands they encountered(as well as some of the musicians they had hired when Ace Frehley and Peter Criss were no longer with the band),and some pretty good and interesting stories. Bruce Kulick and Eric Singer have small parts in this video,but they are to be found in here,and you get to learn interesting stories from when they joined the band and also from when they were kids(you also get to hear stories like that from Gene and Paul)so that makes this video another good reason for why you should buy it.I also enjoyed the video footage of KISS in concert from the 70's and briefly into the 80's as well as some of the music videos from the 70's,80's,and two videos off of the ""Revenge"" album(the videos for ""Unholy"" and ""I Just Wanna"")...however,my biggest complaint with this video is that while it is still very good,some of the footage of KISS live and in concert and some of their music videos are only excerpts...I know that sometimes bands/video producers have to chop off half of a song,music video,etc. for a video/CD to have more space on either the video or the CD,but WHY did they have to chop off the last few seconds of the music video for ""Let's Put The X In The Sex""???!!!
