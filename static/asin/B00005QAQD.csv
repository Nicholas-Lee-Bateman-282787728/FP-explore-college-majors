Ultimately the movie shows how when people let their guards down and show their true selves, that love will find them.

674220,ATXO4UA7N1HDC,B00005QAQD,Ari Weiss,"[0, 0]","During my summer at USC for screenwriting, I was invited to a special pre-screening of this movie because the director is a USC graduate. I generally don&#65533;t like romantic comedies, but this movie was heartfelt with drama, and genuinely very funny. The controversy is the main focus on a homosexual couple, as opposed to the traditional heterosexual comedy. But, make no mistake, this movie is not aimed at gays, so even though homophobes will likely be turned off by this movie, as long as you&#65533;re good-natured (meaning you don&#65533;t hold prejudice- just to clarify, prejudice is bad!), you won&#65533;t at all feel alienated by the homosexual relationship. The beauty of the movie is that the characters are so wonderfully crafted that it doesn&#65533;t matter what their sexual preference, everyone can relate to them and their struggles. The movie is light and fun in one respect, but also sincere enough with feeling that it can be quite moving. The director, Julie Davis, attended the screening and responded to our audience questions, at the end of the film, which was an exquisite experience in itself. Lisa Kudrow and Christina Ricci have minor roles in the movie, and the writer/director of the excellent Opposite of Sex and decent Bounce, was executive producer of All Over The Guy. It&#65533;s a shame the movie will not get wide release, due to the groundbreaking portrayal of homosexual life, but I definitely recommend the movie if you can get past all that.",5,An all-around great movie (not simply for homosexuals),1002153600,"10 4, 2001",2001,1487,"['summer', 'USC', 'screenwriting', 'was', 'invited', 'special', 'pre-screening', 'movie', 'director', 'USC', 'graduate', 'generally', 'don', '65533', 't', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'movie', 'was', 'heartfelt', 'drama', 'genuinely', 'very', 'funny', 'controversy', 'main', 'focus', 'homosexual', 'couple', 'opposed', 'traditional', 'heterosexual', 'comedy', 'make', 'mistake', 'movie', 'not', 'aimed', 'gays', 'so', 'even', 'homophobes', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'movie', 'as', 'long', '65533', 're', 'good-natured', 'meaning', 'don', '65533', 't', 'hold', 'prejudice-', 'just', 'clarify', 'prejudice', 'bad', 'won', '65533', 't', 'feel', 'alienated', 'homosexual', 'relationship', 'beauty', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'wonderfully', 'crafted', '65533', 't', 'matter', 'what', 'sexual', 'preference', 'everyone', 'can', 'relate', 'struggles', 'movie', 'light', 'fun', 'one', 'respect', 'also', 'sincere', 'enough', 'feeling', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'moving', 'director', 'Julie', 'Davis', 'attended', 'screening', 'responded', 'audience', 'questions', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'exquisite', 'experience', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'have', 'minor', 'roles', 'movie', 'writer/director', 'excellent', 'Opposite', 'Sex', 'decent', 'Bounce', 'was', 'executive', 'producer', 'All', 'Guy', '65533', 's', 'shame', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'wide', 'release', 'due', 'groundbreaking', 'portrayal', 'homosexual', 'life', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'movie', 'can', 'get']",All Over The Guy

674226,A26L2EQ97ML3OW,B00005QAQD,"""bruce452""","[8, 13]","All Over the Guy is a welcome addition to the genre which omits any homophobia or the angst of coming out and instead deals with a relationship between a couple of twenty-somethings.The film tells two love stories that are variations on the theme of `opposites attract.'  A straight love story, which is more entertaining because it's characters are less inhibited, proceeds to marriage at several times the speed of light for reasons which are not apparent to me, unless a 10% discount on home furnishings is a much bigger factor in straight marriages than I had ever imagined.  All the better to contrast, however, with all the obstacles the two gay guys keep throwing in each other's way.Dan Bucatinsky is Eli and Richard Ruccolo is Tom in the gay love story; between them they bring enough baggage to their prospective relationship to sink the Titanic on a warm, sunny day in the Tropics.Ruccolo is not the actor from `Two Guys a Girl and A Pizza Place' I would have expected to show up in a gay love story and  I did not care for him at first but nuances of his performance have impressed me on subsequent viewings.  Still, he is not veryconvincing either as an alcoholic or recovering alcoholic or even as a drunk (btdt).  As Tom, a Special Ed teacher, he is very involved with his kids but judgmental and unapproachable to he rest of the world, unless you have a drink in your hand.Screenwriter and producer Bucatinsky plays the choice role of Eli well.  He is a manipulator, a little nerdy, a little nellie, a bit of a voyeur and an exhibitionist.  He has eyes that make him look like he's the one with the problem with the bottle.  Raised on the psychobabble of est, Eli has an addiction, like Tom, but not to the bottle:  he's desperate for a man, and willing to put up with anything to get one.  What he see's in Tom is never very apparent to me.The supporting roles are all well played.  Sasha Alexander and Adam Goldberg as the straight couple are cute and entertaining even if their supposed attraction is incomprehensible to me.  The roles of the parents of Tom and Eli are very well acted also.  I shudder at every scene with Eli's creepy-feely parents.  Doris Roberts of `Everybody Loves Raymond' is excellent as the gosspy receptionist at the AIDS clinic, but the role is a lame story-telling device.But for all it's plusses the film gives me no great satisfaction.  It seems shot for the small screen, not the big one, entertainingly cute and not so offensive or passionate or probing of the issues or larger than life that it couldn't slip into your living room once a week, same time, same channel, for a couple of years and not really make much difference whether you missed an episode or two now and then, like most sitcoms or TV melodramas.The characters mouth platitudes about relationships and cliched lines - Tom's `You do the math' is particularly overworked and not very applicable to some of the situations in which he tosses it out - and a few truly horrible ones.  Tom says to an acquaintance at an AA meeting ""and then we went where two men have never gone before,"" Oh yeah? I kinda doubt it. Eli says to Tom on their second time in bed together ""do you have a thingy?""It's not really much of a love story, when you get down to it.  The characters have too many annoying character defects and seem too ill-suited to each other for me to really care much whether they ever get around to admitting they care about each other at all and I don't feel much of a sense of jubilation at the end when they finally do.  I give `em about 6 months.I give the straight couple a couple of years before she wants some new furniture.I give the movie 3 stars.",3,Was this a pilot for a sitcom or a soap opera?,1030060800,"08 23, 2002",2002,3676,"['Guy', 'welcome', 'addition', 'genre', 'homophobia', 'angst', 'coming', 'out', 'instead', 'deals', 'relationship', 'couple', 'twenty-somethings.The', 'film', 'tells', 'two', 'love', 'stories', 'are', 'variations', 'theme', 'opposites', 'attract', 'straight', 'love', 'story', 'more', 'entertaining', 'characters', 'are', 'less', 'inhibited', 'proceeds', 'marriage', 'several', 'times', 'speed', 'light', 'reasons', 'are', 'not', 'apparent', '10', '%', 'discount', 'home', 'furnishings', 'much', 'bigger', 'factor', 'straight', 'marriages', 'had', 'ever', 'imagined', 'better', 'contrast', 'however', 'obstacles', 'two', 'gay', 'guys', 'keep', 'throwing', 'other', 'way.Dan', 'Bucatinsky', 'Eli', 'Richard', 'Ruccolo', 'Tom', 'gay', 'love', 'story', 'bring', 'enough', 'baggage', 'prospective', 'relationship', 'sink', 'Titanic', 'warm', 'sunny', 'day', 'Tropics.Ruccolo', 'not', 'actor', 'Two', 'Guys', 'Girl', 'A', 'Pizza', 'Place', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'show', 'up', 'gay', 'love', 'story', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'first', 'nuances', 'performance', 'have', 'impressed', 'subsequent', 'viewings', 'Still', 'not', 'veryconvincing', 'alcoholic', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'even', 'drunk', 'btdt', 'Tom', 'Special', 'Ed', 'teacher', 'very', 'involved', 'kids', 'judgmental', 'unapproachable', 'rest', 'world', 'have', 'drink', 'hand.Screenwriter', 'producer', 'Bucatinsky', 'choice', 'role', 'Eli', 'well', 'manipulator', 'little', 'nerdy', 'little', 'nellie', 'bit', 'voyeur', 'exhibitionist', 'eyes', 'make', 'look', 'one', 'problem', 'bottle', 'Raised', 'psychobabble', 'est', 'Eli', 'addiction', 'Tom', 'not', 'bottle', 'desperate', 'man', 'willing', 'put', 'up', 'anything', 'get', 'one', 'What', 'see', 'Tom', 'never', 'very', 'apparent', 'me.The', 'supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'well', 'played', 'Sasha', 'Alexander', 'Adam', 'Goldberg', 'straight', 'couple', 'are', 'cute', 'entertaining', 'even', 'supposed', 'attraction', 'incomprehensible', 'roles', 'parents', 'Tom', 'Eli', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'also', 'shudder', 'scene', 'Eli', 'creepy-feely', 'parents', 'Doris', 'Roberts', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'excellent', 'gosspy', 'receptionist', 'AIDS', 'clinic', 'role', 'lame', 'story-telling', 'device.But', 'film', 'great', 'satisfaction', 'shot', 'small', 'screen', 'not', 'big', 'one', 'entertainingly', 'cute', 'not', 'so', 'offensive', 'passionate', 'probing', 'issues', 'larger', 'life', 'could', ""n't"", 'slip', 'living', 'room', 'once', 'week', 'same', 'time', 'same', 'channel', 'couple', 'years', 'not', 'really', 'make', 'much', 'difference', 'missed', 'episode', 'two', 'now', 'then', 'most', 'sitcoms', 'TV', 'melodramas.The', 'characters', 'mouth', 'platitudes', 'relationships', 'cliched', 'lines', 'Tom', 'do', 'math', 'particularly', 'overworked', 'not', 'very', 'applicable', 'situations', 'out', 'few', 'truly', 'horrible', 'ones', 'Tom', 'acquaintance', 'AA', 'meeting', 'then', 'went', 'where', 'two', 'men', 'have', 'never', 'gone', 'before', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'kinda', 'doubt', 'Eli', 'Tom', 'second', 'time', 'bed', 'together', 'do', 'have', 'thingy', 'not', 'really', 'much', 'love', 'story', 'when', 'get', 'down', 'characters', 'have', 'too', 'many', 'annoying', 'character', 'defects', 'seem', 'too', 'ill-suited', 'other', 'really', 'care', 'much', 'ever', 'get', 'admitting', 'care', 'other', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'much', 'sense', 'jubilation', 'end', 'when', 'finally', 'do', 'give', 'em', '6', 'months.I', 'give', 'straight', 'couple', 'couple', 'years', 'new', 'furniture.I', 'give', 'movie', '3', 'stars']",All Over The Guy

674228,AGAJITEU64H4A,B00005QAQD,Cheri Crystal,"[7, 8]","""All Over the Guy"" is a romantic comedy with enough drama to make it an engrossing film. It is about an adorable yet nerdy, neurotic, perfectionist, named Eli (Dan Bucatinsky), and his search for ""the one"" person to spend the rest of his life with. It is easy to see why he is high-strung. Eli has over-protective Jewish parents, who are not only shrinks, but they psychoanalyze his every feeling.Tom (Richard Ruccolo) is a promiscuous, self-hating, recovering alcoholic, who fears commitment, especially when he likes a person-or worse-the person likes him. He goes back to Alcoholics Anonymous when he falls off the wagon; he claims the trigger as being ""all over this guy.""  At AA, Tom vows to quit drinking-and guys-because he cannot be trusted with either. Tom was raised by uncaring, bickering, alcoholic parents, who fostered his fear of intimacy. When you meet his parents at their country club you understand why Tom is the way he is. Richard Ruccolo is irresistible as Tom.Jackie (Sasha Alexander) is Tom's best friend. She meets a guy named Brett (Adam Goldberg), who works at a furniture store, and immediately falls for him. She finds out Brett has a gay friend, Eli, and since she has a gay friend, Tom, she devises a way to get a date with Brett by fixing their two friends up. Jackie and Brett arrange for Eli and Tom to go on a blind date while they cement their own relationship.Eli and Tom's blind date was awkward and both men decide it was a disaster. Then, they run into one another at a flea market and feelings begin to stir. They have a quick fling, cheapened by Tom claiming it was a mistake. Eli didn't know what to make of it. Every time Eli thinks Tom is letting him in-Tom backs away because of fear. Tom tells another member of AA the story about his rocky relationship with Eli. The person turns out not to be his ally.Eli meets a receptionist at an STD Testing Clinic, Esther, played by the hilarious Doris Roberts (Everybody Loves Raymond), and tells her the whole story about Tom and him, while waiting to be tested for HIV. Doris Roberts does not disappoint as the yenta (busybody) who gets Eli to open up and share his feelings.Eli's parents (Andrea Martin and Tony Abatemarco), as liberal therapists, are hysterical. Dr. Wyckoff, Eli's mother, is the epitome of the smothering, meddling, Jewish mother who drives her son crazy. She gives him neurosis he probably wouldn't have had, had she not gotten her PhD in order to use her ""expertise"" on him.Lisa Kudrow plays a perfect airhead, Marie, in a cameo performance, as an actor trying, and barely succeeding, to make a radio commercial. Christina Ricci plays Eli's sister, Rayna, who is a nice addition to the ensemble.""All Over the Guy"" is about the trials and tribulations of relationships and love. It is a funny, delightful, double date, which is positively yummy. The movie mixes comedy with drama. I have seen All Over the Guy several times and it cracks me up every time.

All too often the answer is no, and unfortunately All Over The Guy is one of those films.  Will these two guys EVER get together or are they just going to talk about it incessently?  I think we all know the answer,  so the talk had better be at least interesting enough that we want to stay to the end. It isn't.

Director Julie Davis does an excellent job of steering this movie and preventing it from going the way of many gay films: manic and choatic. The two lead characters have tremendous chemistry together and as the viewer you are drawn into their relationship and can identify with many parts of this story: a shy blind date, the flutter of butterflies in your stomach, that first kiss, the conflicts, and the adjusting to someone else in your life and making that choice to let someone into your heart.

674233,A21UUO3LE3SDGD,B00005QAQD,CWC,"[9, 11]","Few movie buffs can argue that ""Annie Hall"" was one of the better film classics to come out the last half of the 20th century. Few movies have summed up themselves up as brillantly as Woody Allen's dialogue at the end of the movie when discussing the difficulties and frustrations of relationships people constantly put themselves through because ""they need the eggs."" While this movie was created on a limited $500,000 and may not convey this theme as convincingly as ""Annie Hall,"" it comes very close. Update the topic of ""Annie Hall"" some 20+ years later with the additon of a gay angle and you have ""All Over The Guy."" As the plot is described in many reviews here, I won't do that, but instead give some of my perceptions of this wonderful movie! A good combination of actors, dialogue, and songs, especially the two by Peter Stuart, which set a nice tone for important parts in the movie- this flick is a winner!While some reviewers may not completely understand Tom's (Richard Ruccolo) flip-flop personality of nice guy/bad guy in dealing with Eli (Dan Bucatinsky), it makes perfect sense for people who do not feel good enough for a partner they are in love with due to a lack of self-worth within themselves. Particularily in light of the frowns and pressures put on gays in general society, Tom's rebuffs, isolation, one night stands, and alcoholism are easily understood. Both Tom and Eli's personalities, fears, hesitancies, idiosyncrasies, and quirks are ""explained"" and very well done in scenes involving their relationships with their parents both in the present and in flashbacks as children as Mr. Allen did in ""Annie Hall."" One of the powers of ""All Over The Guy"" is how well it communicates the premise that we are who we have become due to the influences of our parents and siblings as we grow up. We become consciously or unconsciously ""extensions"" of our own parents and family as adults due to our life experiences with them.Julie Davis, the director, and Dan Bucatinsky, who wrote this storyline as a play involving two straight couples do an incredible job of adapting this updated story to the big screen with a gay and straight couple. Great casting and good dialogue, some have unfairly critized, I think, as being too ""Friends""-like or ""soapy."" That's not too surprising to me as two of the actors, Adam Goldberg and Dan B., have both appeared in ""Friends""; Sasha Alexander from ""Dawson's Creek""; and Richard Ruccolo is of ""Three Guys and A Girl"" fame. They all carry the dialogue, however, in admirable and entertaining fashion. Add Lisa Kudrow of ""Friends"" and Doris Roberts of ""Everyone Loves Raymond"" in great cameos and you've got the whipped cream on the cake. I can't say enough good things about Andrea Martin- the cherry on top of the whipped cream! Ms. Martin- very under-rated and under-appreciated- is one of the funniest comedians and character actresses of our time. Most of her portrayals are borderline-line genius and she doesn't disappoint in this film! Finally, Richard Ruccolo's portrayal of Tom made him the ""shining star"" in this movie. I came away with a newfound respect for him as an actor than simply labeling him as a ""sit-com"" actor. I am perplexed why we haven't seen more of him in starring roles after viewing this film.While some may tire of Tom and Eli's on again-off again tug-of-war relationship, it speaks a brillant and universal truth in a great screenplay about a relationship(s) we may have ourselves been in at one time or that we know someone has been in at sometime. The movie flows evenly through funny and serious moments and has one of the most personally intense love scenes- gay or straight- I've ever seen in a movie. While the scene is short on both length and skin, I felt for a brief flash that I was actually ""intruding"" into a very personal moment between two people. Bravo Dan and Richard!I consider this movie to be one of the better gay-themed movies to be released over the past few years and one I have advocated my friends to see. The DVD also has some nice additions with a commentary track, an additional short film, and an alternate ending. Word of warning! Watch the movie, let it sink in, and assess it (as this is how it was released in the theatre) before watching the alternate ending. It will completely alter your perception of the film. For those who haven't seen this movie or those who were not impressed initially, I say watch or re-watch it from the perspective of what ""Annie Hall"" conveyed to us about relationships and what makes them so hard. I guarantee you will come away affected, moved, impressed, and inspired by this film.",5,"""All Over The Guy"" is the millennium's gay ""Annie Hall""",1076371200,"02 10, 2004",2004,4636,"['Few', 'movie', 'buffs', 'can', 'argue', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'was', 'one', 'better', 'film', 'classics', 'come', 'out', 'last', 'half', '20th', 'century', 'Few', 'movies', 'have', 'summed', 'up', 'up', 'as', 'brillantly', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'dialogue', 'end', 'movie', 'when', 'discussing', 'difficulties', 'frustrations', 'relationships', 'people', 'constantly', 'put', 'need', 'eggs', 'movie', 'was', 'created', 'limited', '500,000', 'may', 'not', 'convey', 'theme', 'as', 'convincingly', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'very', 'close', 'Update', 'topic', 'Annie', 'Hall', '20+', 'years', 'later', 'additon', 'gay', 'angle', 'have', 'Guy', 'plot', 'described', 'many', 'reviews', 'here', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'instead', 'give', 'perceptions', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'good', 'combination', 'actors', 'dialogue', 'songs', 'especially', 'two', 'Peter', 'Stuart', 'set', 'nice', 'tone', 'important', 'parts', 'movie-', 'flick', 'winner', 'reviewers', 'may', 'not', 'completely', 'understand', 'Tom', 'Richard', 'Ruccolo', 'flip-flop', 'personality', 'nice', 'guy/bad', 'guy', 'dealing', 'Eli', 'Dan', 'Bucatinsky', 'perfect', 'sense', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'good', 'enough', 'partner', 'are', 'love', 'due', 'lack', 'self-worth', 'Particularily', 'light', 'frowns', 'pressures', 'put', 'gays', 'general', 'society', 'Tom', 'rebuffs', 'isolation', 'one', 'night', 'alcoholism', 'are', 'easily', 'understood', 'Tom', 'Eli', 'personalities', 'fears', 'hesitancies', 'idiosyncrasies', 'quirks', 'are', 'explained', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'scenes', 'involving', 'relationships', 'parents', 'present', 'flashbacks', 'as', 'children', 'Mr.', 'Allen', 'did', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'One', 'powers', 'Guy', 'how', 'well', 'premise', 'are', 'who', 'have', 'become', 'due', 'influences', 'parents', 'siblings', 'grow', 'up', 'become', 'consciously', 'unconsciously', 'extensions', 'own', 'parents', 'family', 'adults', 'due', 'life', 'experiences', 'them.Julie', 'Davis', 'director', 'Dan', 'Bucatinsky', 'who', 'wrote', 'storyline', 'play', 'involving', 'two', 'straight', 'couples', 'do', 'incredible', 'job', 'adapting', 'updated', 'story', 'big', 'screen', 'gay', 'straight', 'couple', 'Great', 'casting', 'good', 'dialogue', 'have', 'unfairly', 'critized', 'think', 'being', 'too', 'Friends', '-like', 'soapy', 'not', 'too', 'surprising', 'two', 'actors', 'Adam', 'Goldberg', 'Dan', 'B.', 'have', 'appeared', 'Friends', 'Sasha', 'Alexander', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'Richard', 'Ruccolo', 'Three', 'Guys', 'A', 'Girl', 'fame', 'carry', 'dialogue', 'however', 'admirable', 'entertaining', 'fashion', 'Add', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'Friends', 'Doris', 'Roberts', 'Everyone', 'Raymond', 'great', 'cameos', ""'ve"", 'got', 'whipped', 'cream', 'cake', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'Andrea', 'Martin-', 'cherry', 'top', 'whipped', 'cream', 'Ms.', 'Martin-', 'very', 'under-rated', 'under-appreciated-', 'one', 'funniest', 'comedians', 'character', 'actresses', 'time', 'Most', 'portrayals', 'are', 'borderline-line', 'genius', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'film', 'Finally', 'Richard', 'Ruccolo', 'portrayal', 'Tom', 'made', 'shining', 'star', 'movie', 'came', 'away', 'newfound', 'respect', 'actor', 'simply', 'labeling', 'sit-com', 'actor', 'am', 'perplexed', 'why', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'more', 'starring', 'roles', 'viewing', 'film.While', 'may', 'tire', 'Tom', 'Eli', 'again-off', 'again', 'tug-of-war', 'relationship', 'brillant', 'universal', 'truth', 'great', 'screenplay', 'relationship', 's', 'may', 'have', 'ourselves', 'been', 'one', 'time', 'know', 'someone', 'been', 'sometime', 'movie', 'evenly', 'funny', 'serious', 'moments', 'one', 'most', 'personally', 'intense', 'love', 'scenes-', 'gay', 'straight-', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'scene', 'short', 'length', 'skin', 'felt', 'brief', 'flash', 'was', 'actually', 'intruding', 'very', 'personal', 'moment', 'two', 'people', 'Bravo', 'Dan', 'Richard', 'consider', 'movie', 'be', 'one', 'better', 'gay-themed', 'movies', 'be', 'released', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'one', 'have', 'advocated', 'friends', 'see', 'DVD', 'also', 'nice', 'additions', 'commentary', 'track', 'additional', 'short', 'film', 'alternate', 'ending', 'Word', 'warning', 'Watch', 'movie', 'let', 'sink', 'assess', 'how', 'was', 'released', 'theatre', 'watching', 'alternate', 'ending', 'will', 'completely', 'alter', 'perception', 'film', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'impressed', 'initially', 'say', 'watch', 're-watch', 'perspective', 'what', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'conveyed', 'relationships', 'what', 'so', 'hard', 'guarantee', 'will', 'come', 'away', 'affected', 'moved', 'impressed', 'inspired', 'film']",All Over The Guy

674235,AVV1ACH67XI85,B00005QAQD,"Davalon ""Davalon""","[5, 10]","Last night I saw ""I Think I Do,"" then tonight I thought I was watching ""All Over the Guy,"" -- in a way, though, I felt like I was watching the same movie. Both of them are colorful, bright and snappy; both of them feature self-hating gays who fall in love with straighter, butcher type men. Both have one of their leading men who has a fag hag best friend. Both insist on having their characters talk as fast as possible, as if the world is an episode of ""Friends"" or ""Will & Grace."" Both are disappointing as almost all the characters are totally selfish, self-involved people whose little worlds are all about ""relationships"" -- and yet, no one seems capable of really having one, because everyone explodes over incredibly stupid, pointless things, followed by episodes of sulking, sighing, crying or feeling sorry for themselves and/or saying, ""I'm sorry."" Both have the self-hating gay protagonists dismiss the love interest so many times that I thought, ""You know what? You don't deserve to have this man, because your world is so tiny and self-absorbed that there isn't enough room for love or acceptance for someone who isn't exactly like you.""I simply do not get these movies or what their points are. It's nice that people made these films so that gay men could get screen time in quasi-romantic comedies, but I felt that most of the characters were cardboard cut-outs and that the deepest thing any of them had ever experienced was an enlarged pore.Richard Ruccolo in AOTG and Christian Maelen in ITID were superior actors compared to Dan Bucatinsky and Alexis Arquette, the supposed leads, respectively. Not only were they were physically more attractive, they were more skilled as actors. The ""leads"" on the other hand were... Dan looks like the son of Barry Manilow and Alexis looks like the son of Herman Munster.  They might be great as character actors, but not people to watch for an entire feature length film.The thing that bothered me most about both films is that they seemed to have their own private shorthand conversations and humor. I felt like I was excluded from the ""clique"" and that it was just too damn bad if I didn't get their blathering and blabbering.AOTG is the superior of the two films because it didn't have fifteen subplots and their were more laugh out loud moments. However, AOTG used the ""f"" word almost every five minutes, even having Ray Romano's TV mother Doris Roberts blurt it out as often as they could get her to do it -- but for what reason, I don't know. The movie could have had broader appeal if they didn't absolutely insist on using the ""f"" word -- it didn't achieve anything at all.AOTG is also the superior because of (what amounts to) cameos by Lisa Kudrow (hysterically funny as a clueless voiceover actress) and Andrea Martin as the psychologist mother of Eli  (the self-hating gay man).I kept hoping for more, but I felt empty at the end of both films.

They are totally unmatchable, Eli the nerd and Tom the jock, but indeed they will discover that, aside from being different on a physical level, they totally match on an heart one. Both of them grown up in a family that is not exactly your perfect ad family, suburban home and 2 kids and a dog, but in a way, they overcame that to become self-conscious gay men. Being gay is absolutely not their problem, find a long-term partner that is another story.

674248,A2HIWDD2TDXS19,B00005QAQD,F. Gentile,"[6, 6]","A real ""feel good"" movie, that's also funnier than [heck]. ... My friends & I are thinking about joining an ""All Over The Guy"" support group, because, not a few weeks go by that we don't watch this flick, or share it with friends, who always love it, & usually go out & buy it themselves. Yeah, we find it that funny. There may be a couple of moments that will fly over heterosexuals heads... But for the most part, this movie is for everyone...The premise of the just met & really hot for each other straight couple, hysterically played by Sasha Alexander & Adam Goldberg, who have a first date kind of based on the condition of fixing up their respective best friends, both of whom are gay, gets the ball rolling. The best friends are flawlessly, humorously, and touchingly played by Richard Ruccolo and Dan Bucatinsky, Bucatinsky also being the writer and producer of this film. (Yeah, the boy is talented.)The trials of dating, gay or straight, and the ridiculous walls we put up in order to avoid intimacy, which would thereby result in us ""exposing ourselves"", and committing the punishable- by- death crime of being ""vulnerable"" and admitting we're human, are universal. This film is filled with so many little bon-bons of witticism, that you'll uncover new ones on each viewing. And you'll be screeching at the all too familiar patterns we all employ, where love is concerned. This is a great ensamble cast, with even the smallest parts, like Christina Ricci's, being hysterical & relevant. Also, Doris Roberts is a hoot as the clinic receptionist. OH !, and ""Eli's"" parents, the psychologists, will have you rolling on the floor at their ultra-liberal psycho-babble. All these characters are just written & portrayed with dead-on humor. Most of these people are television stars, and, as the only t.v. I watch is Judge Judy and Animal Planet, I was really not too familiar with them. But I found them all just great. The fact that this movie is so funny doesn't take away from it also being incredibly touching. We ALWAYS cry at the end. After loving it so much the first time, we wanted to share it with friends, but thought maybe it was one of those flicks you thought at the time was hysterical, but, to you & your guests horror, in actuality was not funny at all, and you must have been having substance flashbacks on the first viewing. Not so with this movie, it's just as all - around great, BETTER, even, the second time around. If you don't like this flick, send me the video cover it came in , and I'll EAT IT! , that's how sure I am you're gonna love this flick.

674249,AL1WBEKIEPUPE,B00005QAQD,"GEORGE RANNIE ""GWRJWMCL""","[6, 6]","This is a delightful movie. All roles are taken by good American character actors. I know that the writter of the play and of the script plays the lead (Eli). He is believable and very likeable.What I enjoyed, the most, about this film, is that the gay charcters are just part of the whole fabric of the film. Their ""gayness"" is not the issue. As (most of the time) in real life, the film shows that gay people have the same problems, joys, hopes, and romantic dreams as anyone else does. The movie is simply about two guys that are the opposite of each other and about how they try to workout their differences due to the fact that they are falling in love with each other--both characters bring to the the relationship a lot of psychological garbage mainly stemming from childhood and/or dysfunctional parents. The flash backs are hysterical especially the ones about the psychologist parents.One of my favorite actresses, Doris Roberts, has a small role that she makes simply wonderful by acting everyone else under the table.Tom would be a character that I normally would not care too much for (my affections and sympathies being more with Eli); however, due to the skill of the actor portraying Tom, I really grew to understand, appreciate and sympathize with him. The actor is ""butcher than thou"" but still likeable.In closing, if you desire a nice romantic movie to curl-up to--with or without someone, buy this film.",4,NICE FILM,1030060800,"08 23, 2002",2002,1424,"['delightful', 'movie', 'roles', 'are', 'taken', 'good', 'American', 'character', 'actors', 'know', 'writter', 'play', 'script', 'lead', 'Eli', 'believable', 'very', 'likeable.What', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'film', 'gay', 'charcters', 'are', 'just', 'part', 'whole', 'fabric', 'film', 'gayness', 'not', 'issue', 'most', 'time', 'real', 'life', 'film', 'gay', 'people', 'have', 'same', 'problems', 'joys', 'hopes', 'romantic', 'dreams', 'anyone', 'else', 'movie', 'simply', 'about', 'two', 'guys', 'are', 'opposite', 'other', 'how', 'try', 'workout', 'differences', 'due', 'fact', 'are', 'falling', 'love', 'other', 'characters', 'bring', 'relationship', 'lot', 'psychological', 'garbage', 'mainly', 'stemming', 'childhood', 'and/or', 'dysfunctional', 'parents', 'flash', 'backs', 'are', 'hysterical', 'especially', 'ones', 'psychologist', 'parents.One', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'Doris', 'Roberts', 'small', 'role', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'everyone', 'else', 'table.Tom', 'would', 'be', 'character', 'normally', 'would', 'not', 'care', 'too', 'much', 'affections', 'sympathies', 'being', 'more', 'Eli', 'however', 'due', 'skill', 'actor', 'portraying', 'Tom', 'really', 'grew', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'sympathize', 'actor', 'butcher', 'thou', 'still', 'likeable.In', 'closing', 'desire', 'nice', 'romantic', 'movie', 'curl-up', 'someone', 'buy', 'film']",All Over The Guy
674250,A3KLCX1XYL9821,B00005QAQD,Glenn_from_CT,"[5, 7]","I've been searching and waiting patiently for the perfect gay film to come along.  Something with a real plot and real characters.  Something that doesn't pander to the straight audience, but doesn't play exclusively to gays.  Something with bite AND a heart.  Julie Davis' ""All Over the Guy"" comes close... so close.  And then tanks.The story in brief: while shopping in a furniture store, Jackie (Sasha Alexander) meets furniture designer/salesman Brett (Adam Goldberg).  The sparks are instant.  After realizing that they both have a gay male best friend, they decide to fix the two of them up.  The first date of Eli (Dan Bucatinsky) and Tom (Richard Ruccolo) goes down in flames, but on a second meeting something ignites.  But Tom's alcohol fueled insecurities and Eli's need for order makes their ensuing relationship rocky.  Essentially, they just can't seem to get it together.  Will true love prevail?Look, I really, REALLY wanted to love this film.  In the end, I liked it a lot, but it missed that being-a-classic benchmark by a good distance.  Here's why:There aren't many films with opinions are widely and clearly polarized as those regarding ""All Over the Guy.""  That's a nice way of saying you either loved it or hated it.  Me, I can understand both points of view... if you aren't into snappy, overly-glib, ""Friends""-like dialogue you are going to definitely hate this film.  I happen to love that sort of stuff.  Okay, call me shallow, but the movie made me laugh out loud on several occasions.  (Example... BRETT: ""Be there or be square.""  ELI: ""I hate when people say that.  'Cuz even when I'm there, I'm square, so where's the incentive?"")  Overall, I thought the dialogue was sharp, and the juxtaposition of a gay relationship against a straight one was handled nicely.I also really liked the acting in this film.  All of the supporting characters do a nice job bringing in a level of quirkiness to their small parts (I mean, c'mon... how funny was Andrea Martin as Eli's analysis-obsessed mom?), and the four leads handle what they're given with tenacity and appeal.Likewise, the first three-quarters of this film are structured well and interesting.  I hate to say it, but it really drew me in.  The non-linear storyline doesn't feel choppy or forced.  So what went wrong?  Why does that final quarter of the film take such an incredible nosedive?The primary blame has to be placed on the character of Tom.  As much as the filmmakers try to make this Eli's story, the crux of the action centers around Tom's behavior when faced with a potentially fulfilling relationship.  We're asked to believe that Tom is a nasty drunk, and his addiction is why he endlessly treats poor Eli like a yo-yo.  And although we never really see Tom even remotely plastered, we can see that he's overflowing with anger and bile.What the script doesn't do is completely justify Tom's wild swings from wanting to be near Eli to harshly and nastily (really nastily) pushing him away.  And it all reflects poorly on the character of Eli, who never truly tells Tom to get lost.  I wanted so badly for someone to just level this jerk... when it does sort-of happen at the film's climax, Tom's reaction is to DEFEND himself.  What is all this saying?  ""Oh, poor damaged me... my lousy upbringing gives me the right to treat others like ca-ca.""  Sorry, I don't buy it.Similarly, I don't buy Tom's seemingly happy-go-lucky decision to end up at AA.  The fact that alcoholism is simply wrecking his life is woefully unexplored.  Most of all, that angle of the story completely lacks any grit and bite.  Alcoholism is ugly.  It's a disease that can kill, just like AIDS or cancer or any other unpleasant illness.  Here, it's handled like a plot device, giving its sufferers a reason to be verbally cruel, and nothing else.Please note that I can't blame Richard Ruccolo for any of his character's failings.  He does an amazing job with what the script gives him.  He plays his winning smile and boyish good looks to the best of their ability.  Likewise, his control onscreen is superb... he's one of the rare breed of actors who can flash a single facial expression and it says pages worth of words.  (Just imagine Keanu Reeves in the part and you'll see the complete opposite of what I'm talking about.)Nonetheless, I was exhausted with the on-again-off-again nature of Tom and Eli's relationship by the end of this film.  And as much as Tom has something of an excuse for his yo-yo-like behavior, Eli doesn't have one for not just telling him to shove-off.  We're asked to believe that it's because he sees something greater in Tom, but by the final quarter of the film it looks more like Eli hasn't an ounce of self-respect.  The ending seems entirely forced; any two everyday gay men in Los Angeles would have called it quits long, long before these two.It's too bad, because there was so much in this movie that I really enjoyed.  I'd love to see this group try again with something meatier.  How about this: explore the alcoholism angle with depth and sincerity by adapting Augusten Burrough's hilarious, self-deprecating book ""Dry"" into a film?  And please cast Rich Ruccolo in the lead!",4,Read this review!

674254,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B00005QAQD,J. Martin,"[1, 1]","This movie is okay - more good than bad - but it has a couple of huge flaws.First, the attraction between Eli (Dan Bucatinsky) and Tom (Richard Ruccolo) is completely unbelievable. There's obviously no real chemistry between the two actors (since Ruccolo is straight), and they're not talented enough to conjure it up out of acting skill alone. Since that relationship is the heart of the movie, its total lack of believable passion is a very serious flaw. Better casting of either (especially Tom) or both roles could have solved it. (Ruccolo looks too much like Ren&eacute;e Zellweger to be sexy anyway, and his shaved chest is a big turn-off.)Second, when Tom, the self-proclaimed martini expert, makes one for Eli, he uses vodka. Now, I know there are idiots in the world who actually do make a drink with vodka which they call a martini, but that doesn't make it a martini. A martini is made with gin, not vodka. Using vodka to make a ""martini"" is like using Crisco to make ""butter"" cookies: you can call the result butter cookies, but that doesn't make them butter cookies.What this movie has going for it are a mostly entertaining and intelligent screenplay (only occasionally irritating and stupid - like the Gone with the Wind bit on the first date, and a few similar times when an only marginally entertaining joke is dragged out way too long; Tom blowing vermouth fumes into the ""martini"" is another clunker); a dynamite comic performance by snarky Adam Goldberg just being snarky Adam Goldberg; a solid performance by Sasha Alexander as the female glue that holds the three male flakes together; and a good enough performance by Bucatinsky to make Eli believable as a person if not as a lover - but even that is more Ruccolo's fault than his.

Interactions, routine love story trimmings, all the things we heterosexuals find familiar in the majority of motion pictures are here in very everyday, ordinary, and realistic events occuring between two people in their search for a partner who happens to be of the same gender.A large portion of viewers of either sex and any sexual orientation will be able to identify with a first meeting that comes off less than perfect, but germinates a spark of interest that continues to grow despite problems that insinuate themselves between two good people who may or may not be good for one another.  Just such an evolving emotional roller-coaster is encountered by the two nice, but very different, men in this really enjoyable film.Some of the deepest loves flourish between two people who are so busy convincing themselves and each other that they are not 'right' for one another that they totally miss the obvious until it smacks them on the lips.Eli and Tom (Dan Bucatinsky and Richard Ruccolo) allow themselves to be distracted by the baggage they have been busily packing since early childhood while their love grows up, around, and through their hang-ups and flowers despite their best efforts to thwart any possible positive romantic conclusion.Both male leads are believable in their sharply drawn characters.  The fact that one is a hunk and one a more a plain-joe makes the story more realistic.  Look around at the couples you know, both hetero- and homosexual.  Rarely are both partners eye-candy, perfect specimen, movie-star-type individuals.  Too much ego to squeeze into one relationship.That both these men had childhoods that were more than a little dysfunctional was also quite believable.  We are each products of our upbringing, some of us just take a little longer to become our own person.  For these characters, their past and parents definitely formed the individuals they were and obviously who they were was the very reason they fell in love.  Who each ultimately became was due mainly to what they offered each other in addition to their love.The straight-couple (Sasha Alexander and Adam Goldberg) and the cameos and supporting  cast (including Doris Roberts) were interesting and brought some diversity to the film, but I found I focused on the ups-and-downs and humor surrounding the main characters.This film has a lot to say, but entertains us thoroughly while reminding us of the less-than-perfect path that leads to perfect love.

674260,A8QG61LYK0XO1,B00005QAQD,JUST A REVIEWER2,"[11, 11]","This has gotta be one of the most under-rated and ""under-known"" US-made gay movies out there (well, maybe not under-rated since nearly 80% of the reviews here are 4- and 5-Star).  But how could it have gotten by without having kicked up more dust?Each time I watch it I enjoy it more, each time I watch it I appreciate it more.  It becomes like picking up and studying a finely crafted object; it suddenly hits you:  hey, there're no seams here, no rough joints; its finish is wonderfully even.  How'd they do this?  And then you think:  Well, Goldberg and Alexander......sure, they've been around for awhile and are truly spot-on here, but.....Bucatinsky...who is this guy??!!?? (only the one who crafted/wrote this play-to-movie, of course).....and Ruccolo...wow...where'd all this acting depth come from of a sudden?  And however in the world did one apparently straight guy actor playing against one apparently gay guy actor get this so right?  Well, the answer has to be, of course, that they understood if it's about love, it just doesn't matter whether 2 guys, or guy and gal, or 2 gals are the focus.  These actors obviously came to realize that, and so it became easy for them to act that.  (Not something that two other guys, named Ennis & Jack, were ever fortunate enough to learn in time, eh?).Well, on to a bit of what this movie's all about.  A pure romantic comedy this is NOT.........perhaps, more correctly, it's a ""dramedy."" After all, how many mainstream gay movies have you seen in which a character utters such descriptively jarring words (see title of this review) after a sexual act that's earlier taken place? Yes, this movie's for real and is very much a real life movie. Just stop to think about it---that when you've had Eli's and, particularly, Tom's kinds of childhood---well, you'll then have a great deal to overcome in adult life, whether it be a heterosexual or homosexual one. And if you, dear reader, haven't grown up in a household where alcohol has been a parental ""drug of choice,"" then don't presume to judge Tom's behavior in this movie. Most realistically, Ruccolo has made Tom a direct product of his parent's relationship.In this dramedy Ruccolo gives us an especially intense performance which is actually easy to see, if you will only carefully watch his scenes: the telling facial expressions and eye movement; his body-set when he, for example, moves to stand against Eli in one scene, or to unobtrusively cup Eli's hands in another; even his movement of jaw muscles (did someone think his role through, or not!) His end-of-film, wedding kitchen tirade (""Hey!!!!!........"") is more than enough to almost scare and stop any viewer short, as it certainly does Eli in that scene. This guy is one hell of an actor......why haven't we since seen a lot more of him? (The ""curse"" of playing a gay role, the hex of giving us such an intense guy-on-guy bedroom scene; is there such a jinx as this?)Yet it is in Eli's control freak behavior that lies Tom's salvation. For, of all the inappropriate things Eli's shrink parents (and they're marvelously performed) have given him that they shouldn't have, it's his capacity for understanding (which they also bequeathed) that will in the end save Tom......and Eli, himself, for that matter. And Bucatinsky is just great at showing us a little bit of ourselves (or, perhaps, a lot) in his skillful portrayal.If you're reading reviews for a movie such as this, then please accept my recommendation to make it a part of any DVD collection you may have.....it's more than worthy of repeated viewings.......you'll catch so much more each time that you do.PS--Can't help but conclude these comments by saying that, IF ""I"" had been the scriptwriter for this marvelous little film, the following is the way ""I"" would have wrapped things up.  At movie's end we'd find our struggling duo sitting and conversing in a garden, when all of a sudden you'd see in their eyes and faces---as if the proverbial light bulb's been turned on---each one realizing that they have in the other what they've been needing and wanting all along.  What a great heart-swelling moment it'd be for us, eh?

The exact opposite of Eli, Tom is a detached, promiscuous alcoholic unable to express the slightest emotion. The two share a night of physical attraction but after constant bickering they quickly conclude that they cannot have a meaningful relationship. Despite a few chance encounters, the seemingly polar opposites quickly fall back into their single routines: Eli hits therapy and Tom hits the bars. Meanwhile, a blooming relationship and subsequent engagement between Jackie and Brett forces the estranged Eli and Tom to finally face one another, allowing more romantic complications to arise.Julie Davis (writer, star, and director of last year's lesser ""Amy's Orgasm) wonderfully directs the large cast with consistent skill and judgment, while Bucatinsky comes up with some unexpected revelations that effectively add darker tones to his abundant sense of humor.
