Yes, Hopla is a little different, but my kids really ended up liking it.  They really get into talking to the TV and guessing the outcome of the games and different situations.",5,Yet another great DVD from WordWorld!,1219968000,"08 29, 2008",2008,354,"['love', 'WordWorld', 'house-', 'great', 'quality', 'kids', 'learn', 'letters-', 'what', 'more', 'could', 'want', 'reviewer', ""n't"", 'like', 'Hopla', 'clip-', 'give', 'chance', 'Yes', 'Hopla', 'little', 'different', 'kids', 'really', 'ended', 'up', 'liking', 'really', 'get', 'talking', 'TV', 'guessing', 'outcome', 'games', 'different', 'situations']",WordWorld: Sheep's A Star

My 2 year old really enjoys them and I think its great how they can keep her entertained but help with word cognition as well. It is a cute series. I hope they continue to make more. Highly recommended.,5,I love these dvd's for my little girl.,1229299200,"12 15, 2008",2008,269,"['am', 'fan', 'series', 'dvd', 'public', 'service', 'television', '2', 'year', 'old', 'really', 'think', 'great', 'how', 'can', 'keep', 'entertained', 'help', 'word', 'cognition', 'as', 'well', 'cute', 'series', 'hope', 'continue', 'make', 'more', 'Highly', 'recommended']",WordWorld: Sheep's A Star

A friend turned us onto Word World, and my little one switched cold-turkey from a Diego-holic to Word World.  We've bought several of them -- these are great to watch when you just need to make a phone call or whip together a recipe, and want to keep the baby busy.I like the voices, I like the characters, the songs are *not* like Dora's ""I'm the map, I'm the map, I'm the map, I'm the map, I'm the MAP!"", the visuals are clever, and the stories are funny.Anyway, I am really strict about TV time, and Word World makes the grade.

1148623,AUUQ7WL29XIJ0,B00153ZQSM,yahoolucy,"[0, 0]",These dvds from pbs are about helping beginning readers. my grandson is 3 but he is already beginning to read. The shows are charming and informative. As a preschool teacher with a master's degree I would definitely recomend them. Watching them over and over is much better than seeing them once on a cable channel. I bought every Dvd available for Levi. Tv is mind numbing for kids unless you carefully monitor the programing. My daughter uses Levi's tv time for carefully chosen videos omly.,5,WordWorld dvd.,1320883200,"11 10, 2011",2011,493,"['dvds', 'pbs', 'are', 'helping', 'beginning', 'readers', 'grandson', '3', 'already', 'beginning', 'read', 'shows', 'are', 'charming', 'informative', 'preschool', 'teacher', 'master', 'degree', 'would', 'definitely', 'recomend', 'Watching', 'much', 'better', 'seeing', 'once', 'cable', 'channel', 'bought', 'Dvd', 'available', 'Levi', 'Tv', 'numbing', 'kids', 'carefully', 'monitor', 'programing', 'daughter', 'Levi', 'tv', 'time', 'carefully', 'chosen', 'videos', 'omly']",WordWorld: Sheep's A Star
