I didn't have much expectations from this film, I never do because I love to be surprised, the film managed to surprise me, shock me and amuse me like very less films do. The film is one of very very rare films that lays emphasis on Dwarfism, but that's not all. David Bennent will steal your heart and soul in this film! you will not dare move an eye lid when you witness this young performer on screen. The film will definitely shock you, change some of your opinions about life as well.

To know that such acts of despair and horror actually might exist is enough to throw one into a fright of existential depression. In particular, the one scene when one of the husbands grips the decapitated head of a boar, and pulls still-alive wriggling eels out from its slimy mouth, and then subsequentely serves the eels for breakfast the next morning. Probably not a film I will watch again, yet glad to have been through the experience.

The only downside about the film is the screaming by Oscar whenever someone tries to take his drum away from him. The screaming gets old very quickly. I usually put the movie on mute whenever he's about to scream. This is not an film for children. Some truly disturbing scenes.

The whole setting revolves around the most tumultous period in recent German history, spanning from the late 19th century till the end of the second World War, Germany had seen boundaries and name drawn and redrawn numerous times. Not to mention the various follies of wars that had ravaged the country. Oskar, the perpetual 3 year old kid, who refused to grow after observing the immorality that adulthood has to offer. Oskar represented the conscience of the ordinary German of that era. Being impassive, and at the same time bitter and vulnerable and again embittered (especially after the armistice treaty), Oskar presented a whole range of emotions that reflects the public mood of that period.The DVD presents a beautiful transfer and a Dolby Digital 5:1 audio track. It also comes with an enlightening audio commentary by the director and co-writer, even though at times the commentary may seem bland and screen specific. Nevertheless, it's insightful in the discussion of the production of the film. Another noteworthy extra feature in the 2nd disc is the documentary ""Banned in Oklahoma"", which chronicled the banning of the film in that state and its ensuing consequences to the country's values of freedom and liberty.",5,German History/Satire in a nutshell,1095811200,"09 22, 2004",2004,1291,"['Tin', 'Drum', 'based', 'Gunther', 'Grass', 'Nobel', 'winning', 'novel', 'whole', 'setting', 'revolves', 'most', 'tumultous', 'period', 'recent', 'German', 'history', 'spanning', 'late', '19th', 'century', 'end', 'second', 'World', 'War', 'Germany', 'had', 'seen', 'boundaries', 'name', 'drawn', 'redrawn', 'numerous', 'times', 'Not', 'mention', 'various', 'follies', 'wars', 'had', 'ravaged', 'country', 'Oskar', 'perpetual', '3', 'year', 'old', 'kid', 'who', 'refused', 'grow', 'observing', 'immorality', 'adulthood', 'offer', 'Oskar', 'represented', 'conscience', 'ordinary', 'German', 'era', 'Being', 'impassive', 'same', 'time', 'bitter', 'vulnerable', 'again', 'embittered', 'especially', 'armistice', 'treaty', 'Oskar', 'presented', 'whole', 'range', 'emotions', 'public', 'mood', 'period.The', 'DVD', 'beautiful', 'transfer', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5:1', 'audio', 'track', 'also', 'enlightening', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'co-writer', 'even', 'times', 'commentary', 'may', 'seem', 'bland', 'screen', 'specific', 'Nevertheless', 'insightful', 'discussion', 'production', 'film', 'noteworthy', 'extra', 'feature', '2nd', 'disc', 'documentary', 'Banned', 'Oklahoma', 'chronicled', 'banning', 'film', 'state', 'ensuing', 'consequences', 'country', 'values', 'freedom', 'liberty']",The Tin Drum VHS

I was 24 years old and had just developed my passion for foreign film (beginning with Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands and Madame Rosa). I had been a German language and history major in college (rare for an African-American woman) and was renting all the German, Italian and French VHS tapes I could from TLA Theater's video store in Philadelphia. A few months ago I thought about the film and wished I could see it again as it was the kind of movie that made the Holocaust feel more real. I was searching for something to watch on Amazon Prime, then the HD rentals and there it was. Every scene that had made such a deep impression on me and defined the politics of my adult life still had an impact 33 years later.",5,Still makes an impression,1360627200,"02 12, 2013",2013,741,"['saw', 'movie', '1980', 'was', '24', 'years', 'old', 'had', 'just', 'developed', 'passion', 'foreign', 'film', 'beginning', 'Dona', 'Flor', 'Her', 'Two', 'Husbands', 'Madame', 'Rosa', 'had', 'been', 'German', 'language', 'history', 'major', 'college', 'rare', 'African-American', 'woman', 'was', 'renting', 'German', 'Italian', 'French', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'could', 'TLA', 'Theater', 'video', 'store', 'Philadelphia', 'A', 'few', 'months', 'thought', 'film', 'wished', 'could', 'see', 'again', 'was', 'kind', 'movie', 'made', 'Holocaust', 'feel', 'more', 'real', 'was', 'searching', 'something', 'watch', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'then', 'HD', 'rentals', 'was', 'Every', 'scene', 'had', 'made', 'deep', 'impression', 'defined', 'politics', 'adult', 'life', 'still', 'had', 'impact', '33', 'years', 'later']",The Tin Drum VHS
409313,A2UEYNUWKVOYPU,6304239297,"Daniel D. Vander Haar ""movie history survivor""","[18, 31]","What we have here is an impossible fantasy story about an exceptionally smart boy, Oskar, who even before he was born was well aware of the outside world, and by age three had made up his mind as to how he was going to live in the world, namely by not growing up. His main tool in this process is a tin drum, which he will bang whenever the mood strikes him, whether it be in school, church, or a circus. He never leaves home without it, and it is a combination of a defense, security blanket, and a sum of who he is and what defines him. Pounding that drum seems to me to serve the same purpose as a young person who can't cope with life, and ends up banging his head against a wall over and over again. By banging on his drum, he can also alter local happenings to some degree, so this kid is more than someone with a security problem. If he can harness and develop his will to alter even more crucial events as he gets older, such as willing someone to die, he has the potential for turning into a raving monster.So why tell a story like this? The answer is not spelled out in the movie. There is no narrator at the end of the movie that explains everything, and so we have to draw our own conclusions.There are several possibilities. Is this an anti-war message, that we should not destroy the innocence of childhood? But if so this young boy did not have an innocent childhood.  He didn't have a lot of kind friends to play with, and tended to hang out with adults. He was one of those children who seem born defiant, who for whatever reason at a preschool age are already on the road to rebellion. Watching him, part of the feeling I had was to try and find some way to help him and make his life somehow easier. But another part of me saw the makings of a kind of movie type anti-Christ as portrayed in such movies as The Omen--a cheapie I know--or a 15 year old John Dillinger who was at that age well on his way to a life of crime. If this kid is special at age three, what will he be like at age 30? Even though he doesn't  grow, he does mature in other ways. And he finds he has a special power: he can scream loud enough to shatter glass, and if he is careful, by screaming he can even carve designs in the glass, such as a heart. Using this power, he seems like a spoiled brat, and hardly lovable. He is sort of like a depraved boy who still needs a mom, and you feel like tossing him out and rejecting him, and at the same time looking for a way to give him more security in an insecure world. Oskar is like the ultimate Calvin character from the comic strip, Calvin and Hobbes. Or, a leftover poor orphan from a Charles Dickens story, and with the slow rise of the Nazis, Oskar may have thought that he was born in the wrong place at the wrong time.Or is the message of this movie that we must face life and not run away? Almost at the end of the movie Oskar throws his tin drum away, and decides he wants to grow. But then he has a lot of time to make up for, and so is the message that life will catch up to you whether you want it to or not, and if you are ready or not. Is it like John Lennon's quote, ""life is what happens when you are busy making other plans""? This is a good lesson to teach a kid, but how many people want to spend time with a hard to control young person?Or is the message that despite our best intentions life compromises us in some way? Here we have the Nazis invading the city, and everything that was feared has now taken place. Jewish synagogues are destroyed, and Jewish businesses are smashed and burned. So you make your choice to side with the Germans, only to have the Russians come and enter the room ordering everyone to surrender. Suddenly, no one likes being labeled with the Germans, and all the logical reasons why the Germans are the people to bet on no longer apply. Morally, Oskar tries to separate himself from adults' immoral  behavior, but ends up being just like the adults despite his best efforts.So we have an allegory here that is powerful, even though we may not be able to spell it out.So there is that side of the movie. The other side deals with accusations of child pornography. That very phrase all but makes someone or something guilty simply by accusation, and because of this accusation, this movie was banned in Oklahoma. The situation there was so bad that the police would actually go to people's homes and confiscate legally purchased copies of this movie. It all started when a local preacher railed against this movie, which led to attacks against the local library, which had copies of the movie available, which then lead to the local Blockbuster store having to give up all rental copies, as well as the names of the people who purchased this movie from Blockbuster, and then the police went to these people's homes and confiscated the legally purchased video. There is a short documentary included about this very thing with this Tin Drum dvd.So what caused all the controversy? Two areas. First, there was a lot of local media hype. There were four forces pushing against each other. One force was a local judge who declared this movie pornographic and ordered all copies seized based on anti pornography legislation, and this even included banning copies from the local library, and seizing legally purchased copies from people's homes. The second force were the protestors. Some were local workers of the ACLU, and others were librarians, who said you should never ban anything from a library. In my opinion just about any one thing found in a library can be used to promote good or evil--or at least be a time waster. It all depends on what a person wants to do with it, so simply banning something is not always the answer.The second area involved a scene where Oskar as a three year old sees an older woman naked, and runs to her in an intimate fashion, and the woman does not push Oskar away. After seeing this movie, I don't think it was pornographic. Here is what I think is being said. Forget Oskar for a moment. The adults themselves are morally weak, and it is significant that an immoral world would be part of the world that Oskar wants to avoid. Yet, as Oskar grows in maturity if not in size he begins to compromise himself in his desire to remain apart from what he sees all around him, and in the end his tin drum can no longer save him from himself. You can see him change in the movie, too. His moral failures happened in spite of his best efforts to not become like the adults. In spite of himself he became like the people he detested. This is what I think is the point of the movie: it is an allegory that all have sinned and fallen short of, if not God's glory, then whatever standards people have set for themselves. Between the two standards it does not make any difference. You won't be able to live up to it.This is the best and worst of Hollywood--as a world wide institution. It is not a giant art class, but is an industry, and is there to sell a product, entertainment. Once in a while, however, a film will come along that will make a good artistic statement about something, and in this case it is the depravity of man. Despite his best efforts, man cannot escape his basic depraved nature, no matter who you are or how determined you are. This film may not exactly be a church catechism on dvd, at least not in the way people think of it, but here we have a young person who tried beyond anything imaginable to not be like other humans and not join their world of chaos and fear, and yet in the end does become like the very thing he hates. Anyone who believes in the sinful nature of humanity should not have a problem with this theme of the movie.I am not trying to defend this movie in the sense that this film is a must-see film. I don't think this type of film is the needed wave of the future, and no matter what I say or how I defend this movie I know someone is going to condemn this movie without having seen it,and without even asking what is the place of allegory in our lives.This is one of those kinds of movies you can't watch and form an instant opinion on--you have to stop for 24 hours and think about it. And it happens almost automatically in spite of yourself.Hollywood has certainly come out with a lot of junk and tries to pass it off as art. Roger Ebert notes in his review of The Night Porter, for instance,  that violence in films always used to have a purpose, but so many of the films that have come recently make the violence an end in itself.While it took me several hours to decide if I liked this movie or not it is definitely worth keeping, because it shows a young boy overcoming his fear and dependence on something that is holding him back, and this film makes a valid point about human nature, namely the depravity of man. And it does so without banging us over the head with a 50 pound Bible.But if the movie is bad and should be condemned--Roger Ebert gave it just two stars--why treat it as if it were a four star movie and draw all kinds of attention to it? Let it die on its own. But our best efforts at controlling evil often times just ends up promoting it. This fact alone seems to confirm what The Tin Drum is all about. In our determination to not let our community be conformed to the world, our loud protests only serve to cause the curious to go and watch so they can find out what the fuss is all about. Despite our best efforts, the community then becomes like the very thing we want it not to be like. But we never learn, and we repeat this pattern over and over and over again.Still, all allegory and symbolism aside, there is a good sense of satisfaction when Oskar realizes he no longer needs his drum for security. If you were a social worker working with this kid, I am sure you would have had to put up with nearly two decades of frustration, but suddenly here is this kid dumping his drum, and no matter how much or how little a social worker had to do with helping Oskar reach that point, the main thing is that Oskar had taken a step of faith, and all the years of going around in circles were in the past. That is a cause of celebration!Just because this film makes a valid point about human nature, doesn't make this film a good film to show after church some Sunday night--unless the pastor wants to be run out of town on a rail (even if he had nothing to do with choosing this film), or he thinks the color of tar and feather would go good with his tie. Still, it would be a good movie to watch and have a film discussion on, at least for the brave of heart.And as for Oskar, he  had nearly 20 years of living to make up for, and so a happy, feel-good ending is not entirely there to be enjoyed. You are just glad to see him go, and leave his tin drum behind.First things first.

It is surely one of the best-made German films of the post-war period. One can't fault the acting and directing; surely the music is as haunting as it is memorable. this time around I found the film less interesting and more repulsive than I had remembered it. Its overall meaning is also rather allusive. The boy has powers that are not explained, nor is their allegorical meaning to which many refer. The boy is an intolerable little monster, but what does it mean that nobody has the guts to take him on? Who does he represent? Much is made of his background, the story of his mother;'s birth, the seduction of his grandmother: where's all this going? The film lovingly concentrates on the grotesque. Lots of toilet-going, eating, and vomiting scenes are filmed in close-up as though they possessed some grand significance, but what in the end do they mean? Why does one watch at length as a horse's head full of eels is dragged from the sea? Why is so much made of the eels, their preparation, and then of the mother's refusal to eat them? Then, before we can begin to understand why she won't eat eel, we are asked to follow along she stuffs her face with fish, eating them as though she were starving to death, head first, munching and chewing with abandon. The sexuality of the stunted boy is made much of, but what in the end does it all mean? Are we called upon to think something of his sexuality? Should we be appalled, find him repulsive...what is the criterion for judging sexual mores? There is in short a kind of vulgarity for vulgarity's sake in this film.

409317,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6304239297,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[4, 6]","""Die Blechtrommel"" (The Tin Drum), the masterpiece film of filmmaker Volker Schl&ouml;ndorff, best known for films such as ""The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum"" (1975), ""Death of a Salesman"" (1985) and ""The Legend of Rita"" (2000).A black comedy that would win the Palme d'Or at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival and the 1979 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.  A film that is beloved by many and its original Criterion Collection 2004 DVD release is looked at as one of the better DVD release from the company at the time.But ""The Tin Trum"" was also a film which Volker Schl&ouml;ndorff felt was incomplete.  Having wanted to re-cut the film with its original footage, the original producers felt that the film was best the way it is, no need to make it longer as it was already 142 minutes long and it was already a masterpiece.  Why tamper with it?It wasn't until 2009 when Volker Schl&ouml;ndorff received the original film negatives and with the original producers having passed away, their siblings who own the film gave the director the opportunity to create the film the way he intended.  So, a 163 minute version of the film featuring extra footage was completed.  Volker Schl&ouml;ndorff has now completed the version of ""The Tin Drum"" that he had always wanted to be released for the public.In January 2013, this version of ""The Tin Drum"" was released by The Criterion Collection on Blu-ray and DVD.VIDEO:""The Tin Drum"" presented in this 2013 Blu-ray release of ""The Tin Drum"" is the new Criterion Collection version that showcases the longer cut that was created by Volker Schl&ouml;ndorff in 2010.  The Criterion Collection explains in the booklet, ""Director Volker Schl&ouml;ndorff's final cut of The Tin Drum originally ran 163 minutes, which was longer than his contract permitted; in the end, the studio and the filmmaker agreed on a 142-minute runtime for the theatrical release. Wishing, however, to finally restore the film to its original form, in 2010 Volker Schl&ouml;ndorff assembled and added the missing scenes based on his editing notes and shooting script. It is this complete version that is presented here. The editor for the additional picture and sound material was Peter Adam, and the restoration was made possible by Argos Films, a coproducer of the film. The completed restoration was approved by Volker Schl&ouml;ndorff.According to the Criterion Collection, ""the new high-definition digital transfer was created on a Spirit Datacine at Scanlab, in France, from a 35mm interpositive struck from the original camera negative; color grading was done on a Specter. Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, and warps were manually removed using MTI's DRS and Pixel Farm's PFClean.""With that being said, while I can't compare this Blu-ray release with the UK version, I can compare to the picture quality to the original 2004 Criterion Collection DVD release.  And one of the things that I noticed is the improvement of clarity, especially during the outdoor sequences.  From the daylight sequence in France, the clarity of the blue of actor David Bennent's eyes, skin tones look natural and there is a fine layer of grain that can be seen.  While the film does have slight flickering in some scenes and also a bit of noise, the Blu-ray release already shows an improvement in picture quality when it comes to overall clarity and detail.  And for those who are upgrading to the new DVD, will be pleased with the upgrade in picture quality.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Tin Drum - The Criterion Collection #234&#8243; features a new lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack. But because the film is primarily dialogue and musically driven, one shouldn't expect an immersive soundtrack but mostly crystal clear dialogue and wonderful music from Maurice Jarr (""Dr. Zhivago"", ""Ghost"", ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Dead Poets Society"").  While one will hear the glass shattering during Oskar's shrieking, sounding better than ever, use of surround channels are quite minor.  If anything, you may hear most of it during a scene when Oskar visits France.  But for the most part, this is a lossless track in which I heard no hiss or any problems due to the film's age.According to the Criterion Collection, ""`The Tin Drum' was originally released with a monaural soundtrack. A 5.1 surround soundtrack was later created from a six-track magnetic element made at Studio Boulogne, in France, for the 1979 70mm blowup screenings of the film. The sound for the additional material in the complete version was created from the original music and effects track, a 1979 stereo music mix, and new ADR recorded at Studio Babelsberg, in Germany, under the supervision of Volker Schl&ouml;ndorff.  Clicks, thumps, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD. Crackle was attenuated using AudioVube's integrated workstation.""SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Tin Drum - The Criterion Collection #234"" comes with the following special features:Volker Schl&ouml;ndorff - (1:07:24) Shot in 2012, director/co-writer Volker Schl&ouml;ndorff discusses the film adaptation of ""The Tin Drum"", the casting for Oskar, where the film was shot and putting together the version of ""The Tin Drum"" that he had originally wanted.On the Tin Drum  - (20:12) Film scholar Timothy Corrigan (author of ""New German Cinema: The Displaced Image"") discusses the importance of ""The Tin Drum"" and discussing its role in German cinema.The Platform - (8:48) Featuring a scene from ""The Tin Drum"" accompanied by Gunter Grass reading a passage of his novel.

And sure enough, Schl&ouml;ndorff found David Bennent, a boy who the filmmaker has said many times, that it was the perfect casting.  And to this day, of thousands of people he has met, not one could play the character of Oskar.And I have to agree.From the minute we are introduced to Bennent, a young boy playing a baby, to a 3-year-old, what was important was to find someone that can retain the sense of one not wanting to grow up and having his growth stunted and staying at the age of three.  Just describing it sounds so far-fetched but the film does have its farfetched moments.  Oskar being able to think up a plan of falling down the stairs, so he will never grow.  Oskar being able to scream and break glass, as if he had the super ability.  But most of all, Bennent having to play a child who some reason is intelligent but yet immature.  This tin drum means everything to him, no matter how old he may be.Back then, I would assume that no one can imagine a child looking like a child even when grown up, but we have seen it happen with child actors Emmanuel Lewis to Gary Coleman, those who were born young, looked young even well in to their 20&#8242;s as if they have never aged.But what captivates you with a film such as ""The Tin Drum"" is its main talent, it's supporting cast and its audacious and surprising storyline.  A potato farmer trying to hide a man under her skirt, manages to get impregnated by her.  Their daughter ends up having a sexual affair with her cousin and marries a man with the same last name of her father.  We know that Oskar is not a dwarf but is he a product of incestuous relationships?  Suffice to say, to showcase a film with such boldness at the time, earned some controversy.  Moreso because the film does show nudity, but there were people who were shocked that an 11-year-old child actor would be exposed to naked women, would have to partake in scenes of having sex with a woman and also having to take part in nude scenes himself.The film was controversial that it was banned in Ontario in 1980 and in 1997, the film was banned from Oklahoma County, Oklahoma for portraying underage sexuality.But going back to its surprising storyline, not only do we get to see the growth of Oskar (not by body but by age and soul), we see this teenager who never wanted to grow and wanted to play his tin drum forever, get involved in situations in which many will call a dysfunctional lifestyle.  And while most films would become banal and make you sad and depressed for its child protagonist, with Oskar, you don't know if this boy will become some kind of beast or monster or if he is going to retain this ""I'm never going to grow up old"" attitude.  Especially when he turns 16-years-old and he is unable to mask his interested in the opposite sex, let alone sex in general.Bare in mind, this is still a teenager that carries a toy drum, still looks like he does at 3-years-old and behaves as one.  But yet, intelligent and clever to get the things that he wants.And for the film's efficacy, the way that Volker Schl&ouml;ndorff is able to integrate surrealistic imagery to near sci-fi audacious scenes makes the film mystifying but yet entertaining and enjoyable.As for this 2013 Blu-ray release, the newer footage introduced in the film is able to showcase Oskar as a more wise individual.  That he may cling to his tin drum and that he may have an appearance of a child but he is one observer that manages to get involved in troubling and absurd situations but one obvious new scene is when he discovers sexual erotica and his discussion of wanting to combine it with Goethe's ""Elective Affinities"".  An interesting scene because it shows the viewer that Oskar may have the body of a three-year-old, but he is a smart boy that is much older.  But we learn how this boy is not as innocent as he looks.Also, another surprising in addition is the introduction of a man, a survivor of Treblinka who's wife and children were slaughtered in gas camps.  But he goes to purchase the grocery store owned by Oskar's father.  But an important scene that shows how much was lost during World War II and how innocent people were murdered.Bringing more humanity to the storyline and is much more effective to the storyline that I enjoyed this newer version than the previous original release.  So, I'm quite pleased that filmmaker Volker Schl&ouml;ndorff had finally received the opportunity to cut the film the way he wanted.As for the Blu-ray release, as mentioned, the picture quality is better look on Blu-ray than the 2004 DVD release as expected.  Clarity and detail is much more evident, as well as more pronounced colors during the outdoor scenes, especially the scenes that take place in France.And while I give high marks to this Blu-ray release for its PQ and AQ, especially for its newer special features, I highly recommend owners of the 2004 Criterion Collection DVD release to hang on to that copy.  The reason being, is that the audio commentary with Volker Schl&ouml;ndorff and composer Maurice Jarr, the ""Banned in Oklahoma"" documentary and a few other special features were not included on the Blu-ray release. Even the 2013 and 2004 booklet have different content.  The 2004 DVD also featured a reprinted excerpt from the original screenplay's unfilmed ending with an introduction by Schl&ouml;ndorff, as well as production sketches, designs and promotional art are not on this Blu-ray release.I can understand that there is no audio commentary because the original version from the 2004 DVD release fit the original 142-minute cute of the film, while 2013 Blu-ray release is much longer at 163-minutes.  But  the UK Arrow Blu-ray release version does include an audio commentary.  Personally, it would have been nice if the Criterion Collection did include both the original and new versions of the film on this Blu-ray release and included the original 2004 DVD content.With that being said, overall, ""The Tin Drum"" is a brilliant film from filmmaker Volker Schl&ouml;ndorff. A black comedy so original and unique that over 30-years later, it still is captivating.  And with this new 162-minute cut, is even better than the original.  Volker Schl&ouml;ndorff's ""The Tin Drum"" is a masterpiece that deserves to be in the collection of the cineaste.Highly recommended!",5,"""The Tin Drum"" is a brilliant film from filmmaker Volker

Perhaps it is appropriate given a bizarre look at the history of Germany from the World War 1 through the rise of the Nazis as seen by a strange child who refused to grow at his third Birthday. Little Oscar symbolized a conscience of the citizens of Danzig when the Nazis are in power and the war rages. I am expected to sympathize with Oscar because he supposedly understands better than any adult around him what the chaos of 1920s would bring to life to Germany and to the world in 1930s but I simply can't. For me, Oscar is the scariest and creepiest little creature with the empty and cold eyes of young Alex de Large whose expressing his outrage by constant pounding on his toy tin drum and screaming with window-shattering voice only annoyed me. As the years pass, Oscar turned into a teenager who became naturally interested in girls but was trapped in a little boy's body, which contributed to some of most disturbing and repulsing scenes in films that I've ever seen and I am a quite open-minded and tolerant moviegoer. The movie's imagery is powerful and I guess the filmmaker drove his point across but for me, ""The Tin Drum"" is too cold to genially touch me and too unpleasant to like it.",3,An Adult Locked Inside a Child's Body with a Tin Drum,1173657600,"03 12, 2007",2007,1324,"['What', 'disturbing', 'unpleasant', 'often', 'disgusting', 'Palm', 'D', 'Or', 'Oscar', 'Winner', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Language', 'Film', 'Perhaps', 'appropriate', 'given', 'bizarre', 'look', 'history', 'Germany', 'World', 'War', '1', 'rise', 'Nazis', 'seen', 'strange', 'child', 'who', 'refused', 'grow', 'third', 'Birthday', 'Little', 'Oscar', 'symbolized', 'conscience', 'citizens', 'Danzig', 'when', 'Nazis', 'are', 'power', 'war', 'am', 'expected', 'sympathize', 'Oscar', 'supposedly', 'better', 'adult', 'what', 'chaos', '1920s', 'would', 'bring', 'life', 'Germany', 'world', '1930s', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Oscar', 'scariest', 'creepiest', 'little', 'creature', 'empty', 'cold', 'eyes', 'young', 'Alex', 'de', 'Large', 'expressing', 'outrage', 'constant', 'pounding', 'toy', 'tin', 'drum', 'screaming', 'window-shattering', 'voice', 'only', 'annoyed', 'years', 'pass', 'Oscar', 'turned', 'teenager', 'who', 'became', 'naturally', 'interested', 'girls', 'was', 'trapped', 'little', 'boy', 'body', 'contributed', 'most', 'disturbing', 'repulsing', 'scenes', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'am', 'quite', 'open-minded', 'tolerant', 'moviegoer', 'movie', 'imagery', 'powerful', 'guess', 'filmmaker', 'drove', 'point', 'Tin', 'Drum', 'too', 'cold', 'genially', 'touch', 'too', 'unpleasant', 'like']",The Tin Drum VHS

409321,A13TLQ1EQBWJ7U,6304239297,Johnny Na,"[91, 100]","I read the book two weeks ago and have just viewed the Criterion Collection DVD.  I found the book to be complex, rich, insightful, puzzling, and surreal.  I loved it.  This film comes as close as any film could to the spirit of the novel and still be under 3 hours long.Oskar is born to three parents who, like the Gdansk they live in, represent 3 ethnic groups: Pole, Kashubian, and German.  He is fully conscious at birth and is presented with two paths for his life - one as a shopkeeper and one as a musician.  While the people of 1930's Gdansk/Danzig feel forced to choose ethnic sides and mundane occupations, Oskar rejects the ""stupid"" adult world.  He stops growing and learns to assert some control over adults through his drumming and vocal talents.One of my favorite sections of the book is when he musically subverts a large Nazi rally.  Not only was this well done in the movie but was worked into a bonus feature that had Grass reading the book chapter while we watch the corresponding section of the film.  The words of the spoken German as well as the subtitled English translation have a lot of power and poetry - this feature is a very rare treat.You also experience in the film something Schl?ndorff confirms in interviews:  it is hard to imagine this film existing without David Bennent.  His voice and eyes carry so much of this film.  The short interview feature with Bennent is delightful.I thought the bonus feature on the Oklahoma censorship was interesting and somewhat balanced in that it portrayed the zealousness on both sides.  However, I would have preferred to see more of Grass or material on the creative efforts of the film.On a more serious note, I find Oskar's indictment of society very compelling.  Something about the way the film brings themes to life (more than the book) makes 1939 Germany frightenly parallel to the US of 2004.  In Oskar's world, the people in power make false claims in order to invade other countries, human rights abuses increase and all objections are shouted away with ""patriotic"" speeches and political rallys.  For the most part people remain ignorant or apathetic to the suffering their government officials are causing.  (Perhaps we need a few Oskars drumming at the democratic and republican conventions this summer.)The film stands very well on its own but I would encourage people to read the book first.  The book is more complex, covers more years of Oskar's life and it develops some important ideas that are not at first obvious in the film.  For example, as Oskar ages he still looks 3 years old and he consciously exploits this by manipulating the adults around him by behaving more childish than he really is.  There is also an interesting theme in the book related to Rasputin and Goethe.It is also worthwhile to do a little browsing on the web for historical material related to Gdansk/Danzig, Kashubia and the large population resettlements after wars in this area.  The excellent bonus features also explore the themes of the film and add a lot of value.",5,Book and DVD both worth having,1086134400,"06 2, 2004",2004,3039,"['read', 'book', 'two', 'weeks', 'ago', 'have', 'just', 'viewed', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'DVD', 'found', 'book', 'be', 'complex', 'rich', 'insightful', 'puzzling', 'surreal', 'loved', 'film', 'as', 'close', 'film', 'could', 'spirit', 'novel', 'still', 'be', '3', 'hours', 'long.Oskar', 'born', 'three', 'parents', 'who', 'Gdansk', 'live', 'represent', '3', 'ethnic', 'groups', 'Pole', 'Kashubian', 'German', 'fully', 'conscious', 'birth', 'presented', 'two', 'paths', 'life', 'one', 'shopkeeper', 'one', 'musician', 'people', '1930', 'Gdansk/Danzig', 'feel', 'forced', 'choose', 'ethnic', 'sides', 'mundane', 'occupations', 'Oskar', 'stupid', 'adult', 'world', 'growing', 'learns', 'assert', 'control', 'adults', 'drumming', 'vocal', 'talents.One', 'favorite', 'sections', 'book', 'when', 'musically', 'large', 'Nazi', 'rally', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'was', 'worked', 'bonus', 'feature', 'had', 'Grass', 'reading', 'book', 'chapter', 'watch', 'corresponding', 'section', 'film', 'words', 'spoken', 'German', 'as', 'well', 'subtitled', 'English', 'translation', 'have', 'lot', 'power', 'poetry', 'feature', 'very', 'rare', 'treat.You', 'also', 'experience', 'film', 'something', 'Schl', 'ndorff', 'interviews', 'hard', 'imagine', 'film', 'existing', 'David', 'Bennent', 'voice', 'eyes', 'carry', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'short', 'interview', 'feature', 'Bennent', 'delightful.I', 'thought', 'bonus', 'feature', 'Oklahoma', 'censorship', 'was', 'interesting', 'somewhat', 'balanced', 'portrayed', 'zealousness', 'sides', 'However', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'see', 'more', 'Grass', 'material', 'creative', 'efforts', 'film.On', 'more', 'serious', 'note', 'find', 'Oskar', 'indictment', 'society', 'very', 'compelling', 'Something', 'way', 'film', 'themes', 'life', 'more', 'book', '1939', 'Germany', 'frightenly', 'US', '2004', 'Oskar', 'world', 'people', 'power', 'make', 'false', 'claims', 'order', 'invade', 'other', 'countries', 'human', 'rights', 'increase', 'objections', 'are', 'shouted', 'away', 'patriotic', 'speeches', 'political', 'rallys', 'most', 'part', 'people', 'remain', 'ignorant', 'apathetic', 'suffering', 'government', 'officials', 'are', 'causing', 'Perhaps', 'need', 'few', 'Oskars', 'drumming', 'democratic', 'republican', 'conventions', 'summer', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'own', 'would', 'encourage', 'people', 'read', 'book', 'first', 'book', 'more', 'complex', 'more', 'years', 'Oskar', 'life', 'important', 'ideas', 'are', 'not', 'first', 'obvious', 'film', 'example', 'Oskar', 'still', '3', 'years', 'old', 'consciously', 'manipulating', 'adults', 'behaving', 'more', 'childish', 'really', 'also', 'interesting', 'theme', 'book', 'related', 'Rasputin', 'Goethe.It', 'also', 'worthwhile', 'do', 'little', 'browsing', 'web', 'historical', 'material', 'related', 'Gdansk/Danzig', 'Kashubia', 'large', 'population', 'resettlements', 'wars', 'area', 'excellent', 'bonus', 'features', 'also', 'explore', 'themes', 'film', 'add', 'lot', 'value']",The Tin Drum VHS

When Oscar is born in 1924 in the free city of Danzig, based on the Treaty of Versailles (1919), the only thing that prevented him from crawling back into the safety of the uterus was hearing the promise of a tin drum on his third birthday.  When Oscar's third birthday arrived he discovered adult pretense and lack of responsibility.  Oscar refuses to embrace this hypocrisy as he stages an accident that prevents him from growing up.  Stuck in the body of a three-year-old Oscar observes the world continue to grow mad to which he raises his objections by glass-cracking screams and frenetic drumming.  Tin Drum cleverly depicts notions and ideas through allegorical visualizations such as the the drum, dead horse heads with eel and Oscar's mother overeating on fish.  Many of the visual representations in the mise-en-scene are simply brilliant as they enhance the aesthetics as well as augment the intuitive thinking of the audience.  However, it is the story itself that is captivating as it offers a philosophical view of mankind and history through Oscar's eyes and his constant drumming for attention when something was about to go wrong.

409323,AC06F0LPHI1TW,6304239297,K Scheffler,"[6, 42]","Not overly impressed with this movie.  Quality wise, it is excellent, but the overall story is kind of pathetic to tell the truth.  Not particularly a fan of Gunter Grass in the first place, but that's really beside the point.  The kid in this movie is pretty annoying, and this nonsense about him stunting his growth so he can go around banging his tin drum is kind of absurd.

Having not read the book I have no idea how faithful the screen version is, but the film stands squarely on its own merits.Disturbing and thought-provoking in many ways and at many points, this is a movie that demands your attention and rewards it handsomely. It is far from a Hollywood studio film so be prepared for a slower pace, but the gorgeous shots of mostly ungorgeous places and people make it all worthwhile, as does the phenomenal script, direction, and certainly Bennent's amazing performance as Oskar. A better child actor does not immediately come to mind. The boy brings so much emotion to the screen, sometimes simply by looking at what's happening. He makes this movie work.The ""controversial"" censored scenes here are in no way obscene and far from gratuitous to the story. It says everything about our nation that we try to censor sex but celebrate graphic violence at every turn in movies and on tv. But then again, that's how you inure people to war so the Boys can keep the trillions rolling in while controlling the sheeple and the world. And that's something this movie points out, ironically enough.It's very wise to watch good foreign films often enough to remind oneself that Hollyweird is far behind the rest of the world in many ways. The perspectives and cinematic conventions of other nations are often both enlightening and beautiful in ways that are strange to American eyes. So much to learn and ponder and compare and rejoice in.This is a throughly interesting film in most every way, and a powerful allegory about war and what each of us means in the broader picture of humanity.

It is no wonder then that Gunter Grass won the nobel prize for literature a few years ago.It is part of the Danzig trilogy but certainly his best. This movie I think is a good as it gets compared to a book that has a lot of pages. I don't know if the other books have been made into a movie.It has certainly helped that Grass himself worked on the movie and could therefore retain the powerwul literary elements. The story is complex but beautiful. The little boy Oscar does not know who his father is; is he a German or a Pole? A distinction which in interbellum Danzig is important, since it a mainly German town in Polish territory. He gets a Tin Drum which he carries with him all the time, leading many people into ruin, including his own mother and possible father.He jumps off a stairway one day, blames someone else and stops growing as a protest. He also developed the skill to use his voice to break glass, something which later let's him get a job with a travelling group led by a dwarf named Bebra, to me the most fascinating character in both book and film. To hide himself from the world he sometimes hides underneath his grandmothers skirt.There are some great references to important things in German history and Polish history, which is so often intertwined. The boy playing Oscar has eyes which really are scary, just as they are supposed to be. Sometimes it is filmed as an old slapstick movie with people that move a little too fast and although there is probably a reason, I didn't think it added something.This movie is so rich as it can be and it will definitely show John Irving fans where he got his biggest influence (something he always readily admits). There are dwarfs (Hotel New Hampshire, Son of the Circus,), historical events and horrible disasters and strange loves. Owen Meany is a very similar character.Read the book of course but the movie is also definitely worth watching as a thinner version of the book.",5,Very good film of the book,1095552000,"09 19, 2004",2004,2074,"['novel', 'Die', 'Blechtrommel', 'Tin', 'Drum', 'one', 'greatest', 'books', 'world', 'literature', 'certainly', 'German', 'literature', 'wonder', 'then', 'Gunter', 'Grass', 'won', 'nobel', 'prize', 'literature', 'few', 'years', 'ago.It', 'part', 'Danzig', 'trilogy', 'certainly', 'best', 'movie', 'think', 'good', 'compared', 'book', 'lot', 'pages', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'other', 'books', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'movie.It', 'certainly', 'helped', 'Grass', 'worked', 'movie', 'could', 'therefore', 'retain', 'powerwul', 'literary', 'elements', 'story', 'complex', 'beautiful', 'little', 'boy', 'Oscar', 'not', 'know', 'who', 'father', 'German', 'Pole', 'distinction', 'interbellum', 'Danzig', 'important', 'mainly', 'German', 'town', 'Polish', 'territory', 'Tin', 'Drum', 'time', 'leading', 'many', 'people', 'ruin', 'including', 'own', 'mother', 'possible', 'father.He', 'jumps', 'off', 'stairway', 'one', 'day', 'someone', 'else', 'growing', 'protest', 'also', 'developed', 'skill', 'use', 'voice', 'break', 'glass', 'something', 'later', 'let', 'get', 'job', 'travelling', 'group', 'led', 'dwarf', 'named', 'Bebra', 'most', 'fascinating', 'character', 'book', 'film', 'hide', 'world', 'hides', 'grandmothers', 'are', 'great', 'references', 'important', 'things', 'German', 'history', 'Polish', 'history', 'so', 'often', 'intertwined', 'boy', 'playing', 'Oscar', 'eyes', 'really', 'are', 'scary', 'just', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'Sometimes', 'filmed', 'old', 'slapstick', 'movie', 'people', 'move', 'little', 'too', 'fast', 'probably', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'added', 'something.This', 'movie', 'so', 'rich', 'can', 'be', 'will', 'definitely', 'show', 'John', 'Irving', 'fans', 'where', 'got', 'biggest', 'influence', 'something', 'always', 'readily', 'are', 'dwarfs', 'Hotel', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'Son', 'Circus', 'historical', 'events', 'horrible', 'disasters', 'strange', 'loves', 'Owen', 'Meany', 'very', 'similar', 'character.Read', 'book', 'course', 'movie', 'also', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'thinner', 'version', 'book']",The Tin Drum VHS

But I have the feeling that there is more to this work of ""art"" than meets the eye (well, MY EYE!)......There is perhaps something allegorical, metaphorical to the film, but-----to sober me up, it must have gone over my head.Adapted from the novel by Gunter Grass, a name that conjures up the finest of literature (although I have not had the pleasure to read his work yet)is the first thing that tells you ""ART"" in very bold letters. Then the reputation of the movie is one of a rather quite unquestioned ""masterpiece""......but we are aware of AAAAALLLL the ""masterpieces"" that critics have fallen for, many times little more than rubbish, so you suspend judgment until you see and analize the work.It is filmed beautifully, with enchanting cinematography. Acting is superb all around. The principal role, although rather limited in expresiveness is still a very impressive achievement for so young a child.And that brings me to one of the ""caveats"" on being dissapointed and distressed by the film. I don't like children very much. And this child is extraordinarily ANNOYING. Having discovered he can break glass by screaming out loud, he becomes more and more petulant and demanding and simply sickeningly, well, CHILDISH. I would have given him a good thrashing----and in fact he gets it, by more than a few adults.After the third time he uses this useless power, you start to pray that we don't see it again.A million things happen. You would have to jot down item by item in order to give some shape to the plot in your mind. In some ways, the complexity of the plot is what ultimately exhausts you. But at 2 hours and 20 minutes there's a lot to explain.It is the dawn of the Third Reich. Soon enough the liberation is here, and in the period between the age of 3, when he decides he will not grow, to around 20, when by then we see that (apparently) his sexuality is blooming (a very awkward task to accomplish since no woman believes he is a-----well, ""pseudo-midget"") his mother dies (after, among many things our boy sees her being unfaithful), he joins a circus as a ""midget/dwarf"" freak show, and he has a child with......it escapes me!The double-disc includes a documentary that presents the details of a ban that took place in Oklahoma (where else? Ha!), the arrest, the fight between the state against Civil Liberties and public libraries joining together to decide on charges of Child Pornography that it accuses it of. And it does make you ponder on how much may the actor (perhaps no more than 10) may have been ""abused"" for this role-------particularly one scene where he is in a cabin with a woman and when he sees her vulva he goes berserk and runs and holds tightly to the area of the organ----- seemingly performing oral sex for a few moments.There is something almost surreal about the movie.

409336,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6304239297,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[12, 26]","Die Blechtrommel (Volker Schlondorff, 1979)There are goals I have had for long portions of my life. Some of them are grand, like the idea of opening a massive entertainment complex: bookstore, cigar store, restaurants, off-track betting, concert venue, and various other things (and perhaps making a franchise out of it). Some are far more modest.In 1980, I read my first review of Volker Sclondorff's adaptation of Gunter Grass' 1959 novel The Tin Drum. I knew nothing of the novel at the time, and to be honest, I started wanting to see the movie because of all the sex that was supposedly in it. Then it won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 1981, which increased the desire. Then said desire skyrocketed when the movie was banned in Oklahoma City as child pornography. But, since it was generally unavailable in video stores, I put it on the back burner.Skip forward to 1999, and I finally got round to reading Grass' novel (and the other two in the trilogy). To be short, The Tin Drum and its following two works (Cat and Mouse and Dog Years) are perhaps the best World War II novels ever written. The Tin Drum is a witty, deadpan look at the war through the eyes of a gnome, always biting. The trilogy is much of the reason Grass was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature later in the year (1999).So now, I finally get around to seeing Schlondorff's Academy-Award winning film. Somewhere along the way, I forgot one of my rules of thumb: that any movie, with a few exceptions, that won an Academy Award during the eighties quite simply isn't worth watching.Schlondorff (Homo Faber, The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum, The Handmaid's Tale, etc.) directsthe screen debut of young David Bennent (She Hate Me, Legend) as Oskar Matzerath, the hero of the tale and carrier of the title object. Oskar, who receives the drum for his third birthday, looks around at the debauchery to which the adults turn his birthday party, and resolves he's never going to grow past the age of three. (Oskar, it should be noted, is quite the observant tyke, even in the womb, so this behavior is not out of character.) He concocts a cover story for why he stops growing by throwing himself down the cellar stairs. Sure enough, Oskar stays the same height as he was on his third birthday the rest of his life-- not that the film lets you know that, though I get ahead of myself.Oskar's shrewd eyes view World War II and its aftermath, and that's basically the plot of the film. While the novel is episodic, it's never overly so; you can tell there's a whole there. Schlondorff and screenwriter Jean-Claude Carriere (The Horseman on the Roof) turn the novel (or the pieces of it he adapted, anyway) into a string of episodes from a bad, unfunny sitcom. Huge pieces of the novel, especially Oskar's later years, are simply left out, leaving us with a string of disconnected pieces that never tie back into anything. The Siege of the Polish Post Office, a section of the book about which whole critical works have been written laying testament to its genius, is played as a straight war piece. You are given no clues as to why the characters do the things they do (for example, Jan and Oskar playing cards with their dying friend Kobyella (Polish film star Mieczyslaw Czechowicz, in what was ultimately his final film role) as the Post Office is shelled by German tanks, or Oskar shrieking the windows out of a church across the way early in the film (important in the novel, meaningless in the movie).It's as if Schlondorff were making a movie that would be seen exclusively by those who had read the novel; Grass fans will get the significance of the eel harvest, but those who've never read the novel won't. Such is the case with almost every scene in the film.I recently read Roger Ebert's original review of the film, reprinted in I Hated, Hated, Hated This Movie, and figured that in this case (as in a number of others in the book), Ebert simply hadn't gotten it, probably for want of having read the novel. Unfortunately, I was only partially right; Ebert may not have gotten it for want of having read the novel, but I got the sinking feeling just after saying ""they CAN'T be ending the film here! There's another hundred fifty pages of the book to go!"" that Schlondorff, too, didn't get it, for the same reason.Oh, and the sex? There's more of it in The Terminator. And the notorious kiddie porn? I don't know what the age of consent is in the various countries in Europe where the film was shot and/or is set (Germany, France, Poland, and Croatia), so I've no idea whether it is or not; Brennent was thirteen when the film was made (and there's no guarantee that wasn't a body double in the sex scenes, anyway), and the youngest of his paramours, the lovely Katherina Thalbach (Sophie's Choice, Till Eulenspiegel), was in her twenties. You be the judge.I'm probably being unreasonably harsh because of twenty-five years of dashed expectations. A number of the actors turn in fine performances, there are scenes of great humor (though not nearly as many as there are in the book), and Schlondorff probably did the best to get as much of the book in as he could; the movie, abbreviated as it is, runs almost two and a half hours. I'd love to see a remake of this, or even better, an adaptation of the whole trilogy, so the surreal effect of, say, the parade in the woods (part of The Tin Drum cut from the film) showing up in Dog Years could be fully realized. Spielberg could do it. He'd just have to add a disclaimer at the end about how no youths were harmed in the making of the film in order to placate the idiot right-wing Christians in Oklahoma. **",2,"Where's the book?

The kid's performance is astonishing, by turns demonic, prophetic, innocent, and impish.The screenplay portrays the vacuity of German middle-class culture and its susceptibility to the vagaries of the Third Reich.Like most movies of this 'offbeat' cadre, Tin Drum does go overboard on occasion. It contains some scenes of childhood sexuality (nothing overly objectionable in our times, I guess) and some fairly grotesque scenes of slithering eels being caught using a severed horse head as bait.

David Bennett who plays the drum beating young Oskar holds the film together. His is a marvellous performance. Its no surprise to find that unlike a lot of child 'stars' he is still working in films and television today. There is a steely determination to everything Oskar does in this film, which in action and metaphor represent either his or some of the society he lives in's hatred of the Nazi Germany regime.Perhaps my favourite scene is where Oskar hides under the bandstand and through the power of his own drumming he corrupts the playing of the band at the Nazi rally, so that eventually everybody is dancing rather than playing at being Nazis. Then it rains and everybody departs (another metaphor?) leaving the head Nazi alone with nobody to shout at!You can of course over analyse films. There is no end of deeper metaphorical stuff that could be found in this film, but really its not neccessary, because if you just view it as entertainment it still works. It is a little to long for me and I would warn that it does have a few moments where you may not want to be eating your dinner at the same time as watching it!I haven't read the book this is based on, but another reviewer points out that there is an important revelation at the end of the book, which is not in the film.

The universe of Oskar is a universe of toys.The whole universe should look like a toy;his drum the no.1 toy.Food is important.It comes to an extreme when his mum kills herself.Eels coming from the horse's head like after-birth. She eats fish,gets sick,eats more fish because of her guilt.Fish is the symbol of her Christianity.The sexual scenes are central to the kind of world Oskar is born into.How his mother was born.We see Oskar in the womb,planning his entry into the fallen world.His mother's adultery is something he's aware of when she leaves him in the toyshop.He climbs to the roof and screams shattering all the windows of the building opposite.Frustration makes Oskar beat his drum or scream.The new director's cut has over 20 minutes of scenes the director was obliged to cut in 1979.The running time is at 163 minutes in the new cut, Schlondorff is clarifying the '79 cut.Casting a twelve-year-old boy (David Bennent) as Oskar, the director fashioned ""world history experienced from below,"" from the perspective of a small rebel armed with a drum and graced with a voice that breaks glass. A twisted variation on the German Bildungsroman, Oskar's education between the fronts of German and Polish history becomes an exercise in alienation and deformation. The youth refuses to accommodate himself to the status quo and compels himself to stop growing at the age of three. His fulsome drumming beats against the tenor of the times and his shrill scream poses a public menace. The film imbues the boy's negativity with a subversive power; his acts of refusal both issue from and militate against the experience of history.Worth seeing for the extra scenes which addnew light to this old material.",5,A Caustic allegory or extended expulcation?,1325376000,"01 1, 2012",2012,4150,"['Oskar', 'Matzerath', 'precocious', 'protagonist', 'who', 'grow', 'up', 'Volker', 'Schlondorff', '1979', 'film', 'Tin', 'Drum', 'unreliable', 'narrator.This', 'Gunther', 'Grass', 'own', 'childhood', 'grew', 'how', 'ended', 'up', 'wanting', 'partake', 'war.The', 'film', 'captures', 'much', 'novel', 'picaresque', 'energy', 'surrealism.It', 'opens', 'Oskar', 'grandmother', 'sitting', 'muddy', 'field', 'heating', 'potatoes.She', 'impregnated', 'Oskar', 'mother', 'Joseph', 'man', 'run', 'police', 'hiding', 'skirt.Oskar', 'always', 'screen', 'often', '3rd', 'person', 'sometimes', '1st', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'where', 'voice', 'coming', 'from.The', 'reason-he', 'pretending', 'be', '3', 'year', 'old.You', 'see', 'child', 'brain', 'grown-up.His', 'shrieking', 'angry', 'little', 'voice', 'opposite', 'what', 'expect.David', 'Bennent', 'eerie', 'doe-eyed', 'child', 'maturity', 'aloof', 'quality.When', 'not', 'shattering', 'glass', 'behaviour', 'more', 'restrained', 'adults', 'including', '2', 'father', 'figures', 'mother', 'grocer', 'husband', 'Alfred', 'who', 'enthusiastic', 'Nazi', 'Oskar', 'heroic', 'uncle', 'Jan', 'who', 'part', 'defence', 'Polish', 'post', 'office', 'Danzig', '1939-one', '1st', 'battles', 'WWII.Oskar', '2', 'father', 'figures', 'show', 'different', 'aspects', 'Grass', 'own', 'character.The', 'ambivalence', 'Nazis', 'are', 'passages', 'Grass', 'memoir', 'Peeling', 'Onion', '2006', 'belatedly', 'justify', 'wartime', 'Tin', 'Drum', 'Grass', 'was', 'lambasted', 'writing', 'too', 'brazen', 'open', 'way', 'Nazi', 'era.We', 'now', 'know', 'Grass', 'admission', 'had', 'been', 'member', 'teenager', 'Waffen', 'SS.Was', 'nation', 'bad', 'conscience', 'was', 'expiating', 'own', 'pettiness', 'Driven', 'guilt', 'write', 'Tin', 'Drum', 'exorcise', 'demons', 'Schlondorff', 'said', 'Nazism', 'was', 'consequence', 'failure', 'Weimar', 'Republic.The', 'large', 'middle', 'class', 'were', 'excluded', 'participation', 'affairs.Oskar', 'representative.He', 'incredible', 'urge', 'power.He', 'feels', 'enormous', 'dwarf.So', 'symbol', 'class', 'would', 'like', 'be', 'one', 'command', 'Fuhrer.His', 'scream', ""'d"", 'like', 'be', 'no.1.This', 'child-like', 'behaviour', 'acceptable', 'child', 'not', 'grown-ups', 'then', 'infantile', 'diminishing.Oskar', 'display.He', 'true', 'world.In', 'bandstand', 'scene', 'not', 'resisting', 'Nazis', 'power', 'kind.Objects', 'take', 'big', 'significance', 'universe', 'Oskar', 'universe', 'toys.The', 'whole', 'universe', 'should', 'look', 'toy', 'drum', 'no.1', 'toy.Food', 'important.It', 'extreme', 'when', 'mum', 'kills', 'herself.Eels', 'coming', 'horse', 'head', 'after-birth', 'fish', 'sick', 'more', 'fish', 'guilt.Fish', 'symbol', 'Christianity.The', 'sexual', 'scenes', 'are', 'central', 'kind', 'world', 'Oskar', 'born', 'mother', 'was', 'born.We', 'see', 'Oskar', 'womb', 'planning', 'entry', 'fallen', 'mother', 'adultery', 'something', 'aware', 'when', 'toyshop.He', 'roof', 'screams', 'shattering', 'windows', 'building', 'opposite.Frustration', 'Oskar', 'beat', 'drum', 'scream.The', 'new', 'director', 'cut', 'over', '20', 'minutes', 'scenes', 'director', 'was', 'obliged', 'cut', '1979.The', 'running', 'time', '163', 'minutes', 'new', 'cut', 'Schlondorff', 'clarifying', ""'79"", 'cut.Casting', 'twelve-year-old', 'boy', 'David', 'Bennent', 'Oskar', 'director', 'fashioned', 'world', 'history', 'experienced', 'perspective', 'small', 'rebel', 'armed', 'drum', 'graced', 'voice', 'glass', 'twisted', 'variation', 'German', 'Bildungsroman', 'Oskar', 'education', 'fronts', 'German', 'Polish', 'history', 'exercise', 'alienation', 'deformation', 'youth', 'accommodate', 'status', 'quo', 'compels', 'stop', 'growing', 'age', 'three', 'fulsome', 'drumming', 'beats', 'tenor', 'times', 'shrill', 'scream', 'public', 'menace', 'film', 'boy', 'negativity', 'subversive', 'power', 'acts', 'refusal', 'issue', 'militate', 'experience', 'history.Worth', 'seeing', 'extra', 'scenes', 'addnew', 'light', 'old', 'material']",The Tin Drum VHS

""The Tin Drum"" Known as ""Die Blechtrommel"" in German is based on the book by German author, G&uuml;nter Grass. The film won the Academy Award for Best foreign film and the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival. The film is about the life of a young man, Oskar Matzerath who falls as a child and decides to stop growing. He spends the next 20 years of his life at the same height. he also carries a tin drum with him everywhere and screams high enough to break glass when someone attempts to take it from. The film portrays events from when his grandparents first met to when his mother dies.The film is not without it's controversies either. The actor portraying Oskar was 11 years old at the time of filming and the movie contains a simulated sex scene. When that and two other scenes were brought to the attention of the legislature by a family watchdog group, an Oklahoma judge declared to be child pornography which effectively banned the film in the state of Oklohoma, several years of litigation eventually reversed the ban. It, along with several other films, including ""Traffic"" was at risk for being banned nationwide recently when there was possible legislation to ban ""virtual child pornography."" The film does have some great scenes in it which make it worthy of the awards it got and that the film should be viewed as a whole though I do think that the scene in question should be removed from the film.The filmmakers did a great job at making the cities look as they did during the 1920-40's. It also has some very well done costumes also. The musical score by Maurice Jarre is also very impressive and definately vorthy of an album release.The Criterion DVD has soem very impressive special features also.Disc one contains the film with optional audio commentary by director Volker Schl&ouml;ndorff and also an optional music and effects only track.Disc two contains deleted scenes with commentary by Schondorff, a comparison of the Nazi rally scene in the film with the event in the novel with audio of that part of the novel being read bythe author, a theatrical trailer, production material including drawings, a facsimilie of the film's original ending which was never filmed, The documentary, ""Banned in Oklahoma"" which describes the events surrounding the allegations of the film containing child pornography and includes interviews with the judge in the case and also Anita Hill. There is also series of interviews with Schl&ouml;ndorff, G&uuml;nter Grass and others.This is a good film despite the controversey and should also be made available in a version with it's controversial scenes cut so those offended would be able to watch it also.",3,A popular and controversial film.,1107907200,"02 9, 2005",2005,2736,"['review', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'DVD', 'edition', 'film', 'Tin', 'Drum', 'Known', 'Die', 'Blechtrommel', 'German', 'based', 'book', 'German', 'author', 'G', 'uuml', 'nter', 'Grass', 'film', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'foreign', 'film', 'Golden', 'Palm', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'film', 'life', 'young', 'man', 'Oskar', 'Matzerath', 'who', 'child', 'decides', 'stop', 'growing', 'next', '20', 'years', 'life', 'same', 'height', 'also', 'tin', 'drum', 'everywhere', 'screams', 'high', 'enough', 'break', 'glass', 'when', 'someone', 'take', 'film', 'events', 'when', 'grandparents', 'first', 'met', 'when', 'mother', 'dies.The', 'film', 'not', 'controversies', 'actor', 'portraying', 'Oskar', 'was', '11', 'years', 'old', 'time', 'filming', 'movie', 'simulated', 'sex', 'scene', 'When', 'two', 'other', 'scenes', 'were', 'brought', 'attention', 'legislature', 'family', 'watchdog', 'group', 'Oklahoma', 'judge', 'declared', 'be', 'child', 'pornography', 'effectively', 'banned', 'film', 'state', 'Oklohoma', 'several', 'years', 'litigation', 'eventually', 'reversed', 'ban', 'several', 'other', 'films', 'including', 'Traffic', 'was', 'risk', 'being', 'banned', 'nationwide', 'recently', 'when', 'was', 'possible', 'legislation', 'ban', 'virtual', 'child', 'pornography', 'film', 'have', 'great', 'scenes', 'make', 'worthy', 'awards', 'got', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'whole', 'do', 'think', 'scene', 'question', 'should', 'be', 'removed', 'film.The', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'cities', 'look', 'did', '1920-40', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'costumes', 'also', 'musical', 'score', 'Maurice', 'Jarre', 'also', 'very', 'impressive', 'definately', 'vorthy', 'album', 'release.The', 'Criterion', 'DVD', 'soem', 'very', 'impressive', 'special', 'features', 'also.Disc', 'one', 'film', 'optional', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Volker', 'Schl', 'ouml', 'also', 'optional', 'music', 'effects', 'only', 'track.Disc', 'two', 'contains', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'Schondorff', 'comparison', 'Nazi', 'rally', 'scene', 'film', 'event', 'novel', 'audio', 'part', 'novel', 'being', 'read', 'bythe', 'author', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'production', 'material', 'including', 'drawings', 'facsimilie', 'film', 'original', 'ending', 'was', 'never', 'filmed', 'documentary', 'Banned', 'Oklahoma', 'events', 'surrounding', 'allegations', 'film', 'containing', 'child', 'pornography', 'interviews', 'judge', 'case', 'also', 'Anita', 'Hill', 'also', 'series', 'interviews', 'Schl', 'ouml', 'G', 'uuml', 'Grass', 'others.This', 'good', 'film', 'controversey', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'made', 'available', 'version', 'controversial', 'scenes', 'cut', 'so', 'offended', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'also']",The Tin Drum VHS
