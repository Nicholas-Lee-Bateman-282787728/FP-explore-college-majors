1266952,A3HP7JU4ZORF52,B002FUI4U6,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"[0, 1]","Grace is about a young couple, Michael and Madeline who for a long time have struggled to have children, finally it seams that their dreams will come true. Unfortunately only three before the baby is due the young couple ends up in a car crash that kill Michael and Madeline's unborn child. Desperate with grief Madeline decided to carry her dead baby to term and deliver her at the alternative maternity clinic she go to, once the child is born however all is stunned as it seams almost as if Madeline wills her baby back to life. The miraculous baby is named Grace and it soon become apparent that she is not like other babies, flies flock around her and all she crave to eat are fresh blood.What makes Grace good is that the titular character do not kill people, she do not attack anyone, she do not have teeth and claws. Grace is an innocent infant that act like any infant would, she is just hungry. The horror of Grace comes more from the psychological terrors suffered by Madeline and the question of how far would a mother go to give her child what she needs? Grace is not a very gory film, it is not filled with allot of cheap scares. There is a little blood but for the most part that is it, this is also not a film that stacks up on the body count. Grace relay on mood and atmosphere to make it creepy. I would also say that this movie is not really scary it is more creepy. The director of this film said in the making of featurette included on this DVD that he had considered making Grace a creature feature, I am glad he did not, this more quiet film is much more powerful, by making Grace innocent the movie takes on a completely different character than if she had been a monster.I think vampire and zombie lovers will like Grace. Now yes on the same featurette mentioned above the director said he wanted it to be a mystery what Grace what, well if that where his intention then he really failed for Grace's nature is not the least bit subtle. Grace is an undead that drink blood, she also have a few zombie features but yes while the movie is rather unique Grace herself is clearly either a vampire or a zombie or more likely something a little in between. What make this movie unique is the tone of it not the nature of the title character.Now I think Grace is a good movie but it do have some problems. First of all the phasing is a little off, some sections get boring while other sections move along to quickly. I also think that the time spent before Grace is born is to long while the meat of the story, the dilemmas Madeline faces while she takes care of Grace get to little attention. I think Grace have a wonderful concept and talented actors but I think the director squanders some of the movie's potential. Also I hated the ending of this movie. I am not going to spoil it but the last few seconds of the film ruins the mood set up by the rest of it. Grace is good but it could have been great if the story had been told better and the director had phased the movie differently.Visually Grace is a beautiful film. The soundtrack works well with the movie. I think the actors all did a great job. The characters in Grace is likable for the most part, but there is a few to many main characters. Grace should have focused more on Madeline and her undead child and not so much on the lesbian love affair going on in the birthing clinic or the troubles of the controlling grandmother, all this took away focus from the main plot which is unfortunate.This DVD has a generous amount of extras, mostly making off stuff as well as trailers, unfortunately the original short film that the director made to raise money for this movie is not included which is a shame for that would have been a great featurette to have. All in all however Grace is a nice package. I recommend this DVD to vampire and zombie lovers in particular and horror fans in general who want something a bit different. Grace have heart, it is clear that all that worked on this movie really did their best, the film is not perfect but it is really worth a watch.",3,An undead baby makes for an interesting movie.,1321228800,"11 14, 2011",2011,4053,"['Grace', 'young', 'couple', 'Michael', 'Madeline', 'who', 'long', 'time', 'have', 'struggled', 'have', 'children', 'finally', 'dreams', 'will', 'come', 'true', 'Unfortunately', 'only', 'three', 'baby', 'due', 'young', 'couple', 'up', 'car', 'crash', 'Michael', 'Madeline', 'unborn', 'child', 'Desperate', 'grief', 'Madeline', 'decided', 'carry', 'dead', 'baby', 'term', 'deliver', 'alternative', 'maternity', 'clinic', 'go', 'once', 'child', 'born', 'however', 'stunned', 'almost', 'Madeline', 'baby', 'back', 'life', 'miraculous', 'baby', 'named', 'Grace', 'soon', 'become', 'apparent', 'not', 'other', 'babies', 'flies', 'flock', 'crave', 'eat', 'are', 'fresh', 'Grace', 'good', 'titular', 'character', 'do', 'not', 'kill', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'attack', 'anyone', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'teeth', 'claws', 'Grace', 'innocent', 'infant', 'act', 'infant', 'would', 'just', 'hungry', 'horror', 'Grace', 'more', 'psychological', 'terrors', 'suffered', 'Madeline', 'question', 'how', 'far', 'would', 'mother', 'go', 'give', 'child', 'what', 'Grace', 'not', 'very', 'gory', 'film', 'not', 'filled', 'allot', 'cheap', 'scares', 'little', 'blood', 'most', 'part', 'also', 'not', 'film', 'up', 'body', 'count', 'Grace', 'relay', 'mood', 'atmosphere', 'make', 'creepy', 'would', 'also', 'say', 'movie', 'not', 'really', 'scary', 'more', 'creepy', 'director', 'film', 'said', 'making', 'featurette', 'included', 'DVD', 'had', 'considered', 'making', 'Grace', 'creature', 'feature', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'not', 'more', 'quiet', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'powerful', 'making', 'Grace', 'innocent', 'movie', 'completely', 'different', 'character', 'had', 'been', 'monster.I', 'think', 'vampire', 'zombie', 'lovers', 'will', 'like', 'Grace', 'Now', 'same', 'featurette', 'mentioned', 'director', 'said', 'wanted', 'be', 'mystery', 'what', 'Grace', 'what', 'well', 'where', 'intention', 'then', 'really', 'failed', 'Grace', 'nature', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'subtle', 'Grace', 'undead', 'drink', 'blood', 'also', 'have', 'few', 'zombie', 'features', 'yes', 'movie', 'rather', 'unique', 'Grace', 'clearly', 'either', 'vampire', 'zombie', 'more', 'likely', 'something', 'little', 'What', 'make', 'movie', 'unique', 'tone', 'not', 'nature', 'title', 'character.Now', 'think', 'Grace', 'good', 'movie', 'do', 'have', 'problems', 'First', 'phasing', 'little', 'off', 'sections', 'get', 'boring', 'other', 'sections', 'move', 'along', 'quickly', 'also', 'think', 'time', 'spent', 'Grace', 'born', 'long', 'meat', 'story', 'dilemmas', 'Madeline', 'care', 'Grace', 'get', 'little', 'attention', 'think', 'Grace', 'have', 'wonderful', 'concept', 'talented', 'actors', 'think', 'director', 'movie', 'potential', 'Also', 'hated', 'ending', 'movie', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'spoil', 'last', 'few', 'seconds', 'film', 'mood', 'set', 'up', 'rest', 'Grace', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'story', 'had', 'been', 'told', 'better', 'director', 'had', 'phased', 'movie', 'differently.Visually', 'Grace', 'beautiful', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'well', 'movie', 'think', 'actors', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'characters', 'Grace', 'likable', 'most', 'part', 'few', 'many', 'main', 'characters', 'Grace', 'should', 'have', 'focused', 'more', 'Madeline', 'undead', 'child', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'lesbian', 'love', 'affair', 'going', 'birthing', 'clinic', 'troubles', 'controlling', 'grandmother', 'took', 'away', 'focus', 'main', 'plot', 'unfortunate.This', 'DVD', 'generous', 'amount', 'extras', 'mostly', 'making', 'off', 'stuff', 'as', 'well', 'trailers', 'unfortunately', 'original', 'short', 'film', 'director', 'made', 'raise', 'money', 'movie', 'not', 'included', 'shame', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'featurette', 'have', 'however', 'Grace', 'nice', 'package', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'vampire', 'zombie', 'lovers', 'particular', 'horror', 'fans', 'general', 'who', 'want', 'something', 'bit', 'different', 'Grace', 'have', 'heart', 'clear', 'worked', 'movie', 'really', 'did', 'best', 'film', 'not', 'perfect', 'really', 'worth', 'watch']",N/A

Ignoring the more standard (read as ""proper"" or ""safe"") methods, the couple decides to use an all-natural, Eastern-style midwife and doctor. After a fatal accident takes the life of the father of the child, Madeline is left to face the possibility of another lost child alone. Through a miracle, however, Grace is born. . . but this only begins Madeline's most terrifying troubles.Throughout the years, babies have been a cute & terrifying piece of many horror films. From Rosemary and her spawn to Yanka in 'Baby Blood,' babies (before & after birth) have wreaked havoc on horror film mothers. With 'Grace,' another nefarious newborn can be added to the list. While not as chilling and well made as, say, 'Rosemary's Baby,' 'Grace' is an extremely creepy and fascinating horror/thriller.Technically, the film is done very well. The script is quite good with quality dialogue and a steady (yet slow) pace. The acting, especially from Jordan Ladd and Samantha Ferris, works well enough. Paul Solet's direction captures the story and settings well, strongly transferring the script to screen. There were some flaws. I wasn't a fan of the attempts at ""vegan shock"" (i.e. the random videos of cows & pigs being slaughtered). . . though, they weren't nearly as disturbing as the random scene of old-people sex. Also, due to several lapses in subtlety, the secrets became apparent, even without knowing there was one.Overall, this won't be considered the best of the baby horror subgenre, but it can definitely stand strong against them as a strange & creepy modern horror.Final Verdict: 7/10.-AP3-",4,Creepy & demented modern baby horror,1279584000,"07 20, 2010",2010,1682,"[""'Grace"", 'tale', 'grieving', 'couple', 'preparing', 'birth', 'first', 'child', 'Ignoring', 'more', 'standard', 'read', 'proper', 'safe', 'methods', 'couple', 'use', 'all-natural', 'Eastern-style', 'midwife', 'doctor', 'fatal', 'accident', 'life', 'father', 'child', 'Madeline', 'left', 'face', 'possibility', 'lost', 'child', 'alone', 'miracle', 'however', 'Grace', 'born', 'only', 'Madeline', 'most', 'terrifying', 'years', 'babies', 'have', 'been', 'cute', 'terrifying', 'piece', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'Rosemary', 'spawn', 'Yanka', ""'Baby"", 'Blood', 'babies', 'birth', 'have', 'wreaked', 'havoc', 'horror', 'film', 'mothers', ""'Grace"", 'nefarious', 'newborn', 'can', 'be', 'added', 'list', 'not', 'chilling', 'well', 'made', 'say', 'Baby', 'extremely', 'creepy', 'fascinating', 'horror/thriller.Technically', 'film', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'script', 'quite', 'good', 'quality', 'dialogue', 'steady', 'yet', 'slow', 'pace', 'acting', 'especially', 'Jordan', 'Ladd', 'Samantha', 'Ferris', 'well', 'enough', 'Paul', 'Solet', 'direction', 'story', 'settings', 'well', 'strongly', 'transferring', 'script', 'screen', 'were', 'flaws', 'was', ""n't"", 'fan', 'attempts', 'vegan', 'shock', 'i.e', 'random', 'videos', 'cows', 'pigs', 'being', 'slaughtered', 'were', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'disturbing', 'random', 'scene', 'old-people', 'sex', 'Also', 'due', 'several', 'lapses', 'subtlety', 'secrets', 'became', 'apparent', 'even', 'knowing', 'was', 'one.Overall', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'considered', 'best', 'baby', 'horror', 'subgenre', 'can', 'definitely', 'stand', 'strong', 'strange', 'creepy', 'modern', 'horror.Final', 'Verdict', '7/10.-AP3-']",N/A
1266954,A2582KMXLK2P06,B002FUI4U6,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","This is quite possibly the most disturbing film I've seen in quite a while.  It's not actually a horror film- just has a heavy emphasis on being unusually disturbing, quiet, and very very different.It's about a mother who gives birth to a baby who's... not hungry for milk, but hungry for *blood*.  So what does the mother do to give her baby the food he needs in order to survive?The mother first buys the baby some meat at the local supermarket, and puts the meat in a blender to give the baby a bloody milkshake for his bottle.After a while... that's not good enough and the baby has bigger and more aggressive cravings, so the mother has to actually KILL people and feed her baby human blood.While the storyline itself is disturbing, the film is still flawed in several other areas.For one thing, all the people who try helping the mother with her baby are pretty much wasting their time, and don't accomplish anything with their concerns.  I felt this was more like laziness on the part of the film writers.While you could argue all the outside characters are meant to be suspiciously quiet to add to the atmosphere and the disturbing nature of the storyline, I felt they should have been better utilized, which would have gone a long way in making them feel more important which therefore would have made the conclusion more exciting.Another problem is that the storyline feels severely undeveloped.  There should have been more killing scenes, and there should have been more disturbing situations involving the baby.Yes, we see the baby completely rip his moms breasts apart in a quest to lap down as much blood as the baby possibly can, and yes, a few people die along the way, but it honestly never felt like it was enough.  The film is quite short around 75 minutes, and it needed to be a little bit longer.Then again, there wasn't really a whole lot to the storyline for much of those 75 minutes, and much of the events taking place felt like pointless filler to me (such as the scenes showing flies buzzing around in the bedroom- simply put, these scenes stunk).The acting is pretty good though, especially from the mother who's always exhausted, confused, worried... showing all the accurate and believable emotions whenever necessary.  Good job there.Flawed, but watchable.

1266957,A2BHRZHZONOXSU,B002FUI4U6,"Brian T ""The Coolest Movies""","[1, 2]","Writer-director Paul Solet is that rare breed in horror: someone who appreciates subtlety, inference, and uneasiness over explicitness and explanation, doesn't shamelessly copy or reference new and hold horror tropes for today's unbearably hip audiences, is not compelled to edit his creation to within an inch of its life to generate artificial suspense or have buckets of blood smeared across the screen in order to stake a claim on a very crowded field. Don't get me wrong, there is blood, but it flows only when it needs to, and in ways that will make you cringe. But Solet's focus here is on developing character and establishing mood, much as it was for the studio-based directors behind some of the classic suburban horrors of the 70's such as The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby and The Omen. GRACE doesn't have their high-dollar polish, but its director is clearly channeling the same spirit.(Note: if you want to know more plot details, read the countless other reviews here, or the product description itself).In his first feature after a handful of shorts--one of which was expanded into this film--Solet marks himself as someone to watch if, or more likely when, a studio gives him a decent budget and some top-shelf performers. With it's effectively dreary Saskatoon locations, empathy toward it's heroine (Jordan Ladd) even as she gradually becomes one of the film's villains, and its subversive take on alternative medicine, veganism, lesbianism and, most biting of all, the sanctity and insanity of motherhood with all its obsessions, GRACE was probably too much of an intellectual exercise to land a wide theatrical release, but is much better served by the intimacy of home viewing where the individual viewer (perhaps with company) can savour its realistically uncomfortable family dysfunction and clever satire, all the while becoming increasingly chilled by the actions of the three obsessive women its core, and the dead (but alive!) infant who ties them together.Anchor Bay's DVD provides copious insight into the making of an independent horror production, from gestation to casting to production to scoring and the inevitable festival accolades. There's nothing here that DVD buffs won't have seen in the supplements of a million other DVDs, but taken on it's own, it's about 85 minutes of indie how-to in a can, bolstered by a feature length commentary by the director, producer and DP.  The commentary, like the documentary features, covers familiar territory for the connoisseur, but for aspiring filmmakers, it provides the requisite amount of enlightenment and inspiration.All in all, a nice package for a willfully grim little picture.

So my expectations were pretty high, and in the end they werent met.The story is about a woman, Madeline who desperately wants a baby; she has had two miscarriages and has been on fertility drugs in the past, but is off of them now. When she finally, naturally gets pregnant she is overjoyed. Some things about Madeline, she is a vegan, an animal rights activist, and has in her past lived and went to school with her now midwife Patricia who is still in love with Madeline.  Playing in her kitchen, seemingly 24/7 is a computer depicting animal cruelty (which I found to be ...overkill in the true sense of the word). She feeds her cat Soy milk but Jonesy (the name of the cat in Aliens) still wants to go out and kill mice. Her husband Michael believes the cats carnivorous nature is on overload because it never gets any real meat. Foreshadowing perhaps? Madeline's love of all things natural is off-putting to Michaels mother Viviane, and she takes it upon herself to become the baby's savior, typical mother in law !Events take place after a car accident and although they are a bit disturbing, I found it hard to believe what was going on due to the obvious lack of special effects budget. It was more shock for shock sake, and not for the audience or to move the story alongThe baby comes and it's definitely not a normal child, and Madeline being so obsessed with having a baby will do anything to keep it alive. I was really trying to connect to the characters throughout, either by understanding their motivation, or by not understand it and wanting to know why. I was actually very bored by the middle of the movie, and fast forwarded to save myself from falling asleep. I also was thrown off by how different Grace looked from shot to shot because they used two different babies, plus a fake baby, it didn't gel. The ending just made me laugh. I saw a clip on the extras where they are showing the film at Sundance and people are screaming at the end and that just puzzles me. I am not that desensitized to blood and guts to not be frightened anymore and that ending was just lame.I get that this is an independent film, I get that the budget wasn't enormous, but I didn't get how disjointed it was. Why does Madeline only go to the midwife at 8 months along? You would think she had prenatal care on the brain being so adamant about being healthy!! Is its message that doctors are evil, or that vegans are foolish, or that a mothers love is blind to even murder and pain? Is this a scary movie? No. Does it have some imagery that is a bit disturbing, yes? Will you faint from watching it? Doubtful. Should you buy it? No. Rent it? Yes, but only if you appreciate independent films, and do not expect much out of this one.",3,Baby Mine.,1254096000,"09 28, 2009",2009,2904,"['had', 'heard', 'Grace', 'buzz', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Two', 'grown', 'men', 'fainted', 'countless', 'reviewers', 'who', 'said', 'was', 'Disturbing', 'Horrifying', 'expectations', 'were', 'pretty', 'high', 'end', 'werent', 'met.The', 'story', 'woman', 'Madeline', 'who', 'desperately', 'baby', 'had', 'two', 'miscarriages', 'been', 'fertility', 'drugs', 'past', 'now', 'When', 'finally', 'naturally', 'pregnant', 'overjoyed', 'things', 'Madeline', 'vegan', 'animal', 'rights', 'activist', 'past', 'lived', 'went', 'school', 'now', 'midwife', 'Patricia', 'who', 'still', 'love', 'Madeline', 'Playing', 'kitchen', 'seemingly', '24/7', 'computer', 'depicting', 'animal', 'cruelty', 'found', 'be', 'true', 'sense', 'word', 'cat', 'Soy', 'milk', 'Jonesy', 'name', 'cat', 'Aliens', 'still', 'go', 'out', 'kill', 'mice', 'husband', 'Michael', 'cats', 'carnivorous', 'nature', 'overload', 'never', 'real', 'meat', 'Foreshadowing', 'perhaps', 'Madeline', 'love', 'things', 'natural', 'off-putting', 'Michaels', 'mother', 'Viviane', 'become', 'baby', 'savior', 'typical', 'mother', 'law', 'Events', 'take', 'place', 'car', 'accident', 'are', 'bit', 'disturbing', 'found', 'hard', 'believe', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'due', 'obvious', 'lack', 'special', 'effects', 'budget', 'was', 'more', 'shock', 'shock', 'sake', 'not', 'audience', 'move', 'story', 'alongThe', 'baby', 'definitely', 'not', 'normal', 'child', 'Madeline', 'being', 'so', 'obsessed', 'having', 'baby', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'keep', 'alive', 'was', 'really', 'trying', 'connect', 'characters', 'either', 'understanding', 'motivation', 'not', 'understand', 'wanting', 'know', 'why', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'bored', 'middle', 'movie', 'fast', 'forwarded', 'save', 'falling', 'asleep', 'also', 'was', 'thrown', 'off', 'how', 'different', 'Grace', 'looked', 'shot', 'shot', 'used', 'two', 'different', 'babies', 'fake', 'baby', 'did', ""n't"", 'gel', 'ending', 'just', 'made', 'saw', 'clip', 'extras', 'where', 'are', 'showing', 'film', 'Sundance', 'people', 'are', 'screaming', 'end', 'just', 'am', 'not', 'desensitized', 'blood', 'guts', 'not', 'be', 'frightened', 'anymore', 'ending', 'was', 'just', 'lame.I', 'get', 'independent', 'film', 'get', 'budget', 'was', ""n't"", 'enormous', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'how', 'disjointed', 'was', 'Why', 'Madeline', 'only', 'go', 'midwife', '8', 'months', 'would', 'think', 'had', 'prenatal', 'care', 'brain', 'being', 'so', 'adamant', 'being', 'healthy', 'message', 'doctors', 'are', 'evil', 'vegans', 'are', 'foolish', 'mothers', 'love', 'even', 'murder', 'pain', 'scary', 'movie', 'No', 'have', 'imagery', 'bit', 'disturbing', 'yes', 'Will', 'faint', 'watching', 'Doubtful', 'Should', 'buy', 'No', 'Rent', 'Yes', 'only', 'appreciate', 'independent', 'films', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'much', 'one']",N/A

This film manages to be creepy without resorting to a bunch of cheap gags. Much of what I found to be the most creepy came from the ""normal"" scenes.Madeline desperately wants a baby. Having already miscarried several times, she was overjoyed to discover that she was pregnant with what seemed to be a healthy fetus. Sure, she has to butt heads with her overbearing mother-in-law Vivian, but she's getting what she's always wanted: a baby. Unfortunately a ride home from the ER one night after a pregnancy scare leaves both her husband & her baby dead. Refusing to believe that the baby is gone, Madeline insists on waiting the remaining two weeks of gestation & delivering it as if it was stillborn. (Lucky for her, her midwife agrees to this.) When Madeline does give birth, she sees her baby come back to life in what is seemingly a miracle. Again misfortune strikes as she discovers that her baby is not a normal child. She smells like a dead thing, flies crawl over her body & she is incapable of drinking normal formula. The infant Grace can only digest blood.I have to admit, I didn't quite know what to make of this movie after watching it the first time. It'd be easy for many to dismiss this as ""a boring movie"" because there really isn't any blood or gore to this film & the titular character of Grace doesn't run around trying to kill anyone. Most of the scares & creepiness of this film comes from symbolism & imagery. At one specific point in the film we see a closeup on a ""World's Greatest Mother"" mug as Madeline gets ready to do unspeakable things to feed her baby, making us ask whether Madeline is truly doing her child any favors or if she is actually deserving of the title.There are a lot of things left unsaid in this movie. For instance, there are the instances of the marriage between Madeline & Michael. From looking at them in one of the first scenes in the movie, Madeline seems to show no passion for him. Could this mean that she married for the wrong reasons? (Can't say more without being somewhat spoilerish.) Is Grace's unnatural life a symbol of Madeline trying to live a lifestyle that she shouldn't? There's a lot of questions such as these throughout the film, which is why I enjoyed this film as much as I did.I wish that the original 6 minute short was on this DVD & I can't help but wonder why it's not, as Solet wrote & directed that one as well. Between the two of them I do prefer the short. It's more crudely done, but it did seem to be more eerie than the two of them. In any case, there's a lot of nice features on this disc. There's a trailer (of course) as well as several videos about making the film & such. There's even a copy of the script, although that part of the feature is only accessible through your computer. Still... I really wish that the short was on here.If you aren't prepared to think during this movie or if you want something brainless to watch, skip this movie. This isn't a ""Halloween"" or ""Scream"" type of movie. I'd also warn others- if you want a movie where everything is solved & tied up neatly into a bow, you may want to exercise caution when watching this movie. We are never told exactly how or why many of the things in the movie happen- we're left to make our own decisions about what exactly happened.  Unless you are a fan of movies such as these, I recommend that you rent this rather than buy it.Overall, I'd give this film a 3.75 on the ratings scale. It's not the absolute best movie in this genre I've ever seen, but it is one of the most original ones I've seen in quite a while. (Since we can't give out fractions, I'll round it up to 4 stars.)",4,Won't thrill viewers looking for a quick scare but is worth the time to watch!,1253577600,"09 22, 2009",2009,3800,"['been', 'while', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'horror', 'film', 'resorting', 'buckets', 'blood', 'gore', 'cheap', 'scary', 'music', 'quick', 'glimpse', 'something', 'freaky', 'film', 'be', 'creepy', 'resorting', 'bunch', 'cheap', 'gags', 'Much', 'what', 'found', 'be', 'most', 'creepy', 'came', 'normal', 'scenes.Madeline', 'desperately', 'baby', 'Having', 'already', 'miscarried', 'several', 'times', 'was', 'overjoyed', 'discover', 'was', 'pregnant', 'what', 'seemed', 'be', 'healthy', 'fetus', 'Sure', 'butt', 'heads', 'overbearing', 'mother-in-law', 'Vivian', 'getting', 'what', 'always', 'wanted', 'baby', 'Unfortunately', 'ride', 'home', 'ER', 'one', 'night', 'pregnancy', 'scare', 'husband', 'baby', 'dead', 'Refusing', 'believe', 'baby', 'gone', 'Madeline', 'waiting', 'remaining', 'two', 'weeks', 'gestation', 'delivering', 'was', 'stillborn', 'Lucky', 'midwife', 'When', 'Madeline', 'give', 'birth', 'baby', 'come', 'back', 'life', 'what', 'seemingly', 'miracle', 'Again', 'misfortune', 'strikes', 'baby', 'not', 'normal', 'child', 'dead', 'thing', 'flies', 'crawl', 'body', 'incapable', 'drinking', 'normal', 'formula', 'infant', 'Grace', 'can', 'only', 'digest', 'blood.I', 'have', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'make', 'movie', 'watching', 'first', 'time', ""'d"", 'be', 'easy', 'many', 'dismiss', 'boring', 'movie', 'really', ""n't"", 'blood', 'gore', 'film', 'titular', 'character', 'Grace', ""n't"", 'run', 'around', 'trying', 'kill', 'anyone', 'Most', 'scares', 'creepiness', 'film', 'symbolism', 'imagery', 'one', 'specific', 'point', 'film', 'see', 'closeup', 'World', 'Greatest', 'Mother', 'mug', 'Madeline', 'ready', 'do', 'unspeakable', 'things', 'feed', 'baby', 'making', 'ask', 'Madeline', 'truly', 'doing', 'child', 'favors', 'actually', 'deserving', 'are', 'lot', 'things', 'left', 'unsaid', 'movie', 'instance', 'are', 'instances', 'marriage', 'Madeline', 'Michael', 'looking', 'one', 'first', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Madeline', 'show', 'passion', 'Could', 'mean', 'married', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'being', 'somewhat', 'spoilerish', 'Grace', 'unnatural', 'life', 'symbol', 'Madeline', 'trying', 'live', 'lifestyle', 'should', ""n't"", 'lot', 'questions', 'such', 'film', 'why', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'did.I', 'wish', 'original', '6', 'minute', 'short', 'was', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'why', 'not', 'Solet', 'wrote', 'directed', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'Between', 'two', 'do', 'prefer', 'short', 'more', 'crudely', 'done', 'did', 'seem', 'be', 'more', 'eerie', 'two', 'case', 'lot', 'nice', 'features', 'disc', 'trailer', 'course', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'videos', 'making', 'film', 'such', 'even', 'copy', 'script', 'part', 'feature', 'only', 'accessible', 'computer', 'Still', 'really', 'wish', 'short', 'was', 'here.If', 'are', ""n't"", 'prepared', 'think', 'movie', 'want', 'something', 'brainless', 'watch', 'skip', 'movie', ""n't"", 'Halloween', 'Scream', 'type', 'movie', ""'d"", 'also', 'warn', 'others-', 'want', 'movie', 'where', 'everything', 'solved', 'tied', 'up', 'neatly', 'bow', 'may', 'want', 'exercise', 'caution', 'when', 'watching', 'movie', 'are', 'never', 'told', 'exactly', 'how', 'why', 'many', 'things', 'movie', 'happen-', ""'re"", 'left', 'make', 'own', 'decisions', 'what', 'exactly', 'happened', 'are', 'fan', 'movies', 'such', 'recommend', 'rent', 'rather', 'buy', 'it.Overall', ""'d"", 'give', 'film', '3.75', 'ratings', 'scale', 'not', 'absolute', 'best', 'movie', 'genre', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'while', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'out', 'fractions', ""'ll"", 'round', '4', 'stars']",N/A

While I'll admit that I didn't find myself doing that and wonder what was so tough for the two people who did I'll admit that I have a tougher degree of fortitude. And while I'll admit that I did not find Grace to be the most horrific thing ever created Paul Solet has made one of the more interesting horror films of the year in my opinion, something that earns the praise even if the two fainters were a bit much.Much of what I liked about the movie comes from the idea of motherhood. If you've haven't heard of the plot Madeline is a young wife expecting her first child with her husband Michael all the while domineering mother in law Vivian is watching them from the sidelines. Visiting the hospital one night after an incident the couple are on their way home are in auto accident where Madeline is the only survivor. Michael is dead leaving Vivian grief stricken while Madeline decides to carry her dead baby to term with the help of Lesbian midwife Patricia. On the day of the birth of course things get suprising when the fetus born dead suddenly jolts back to life. Madeline is happy while Vivian concots a plan with her family doctor to take guardianship of Grace. Madeline sets to raising Grace despite the suspicions of Patricia who might be on to something as Grace develops a rash starts losing hair and is vomitting milk. More suspicious is the flys circling Graces room or her need for blood. But whatever Madeline has giggling gurgling little tot (for some reason I was impressed they used a real baby although of course the film wouldn't have been effective using a It's Alive baby).Despite not being something I'd faint at the films undercurrent of what a woman would do for a baby and to experience the joys of motherhood that I found interesting. Madeline takes to draining naturally butchered meat while Vivian is obsessed with her dead child as much as her grandchild. Even more interesting is the ending which I won't reveal but it does beg to question how much these people will take from Grace before they admit that their child just isn't right. Thats an interesting concept something that far overshadows gore and violence in my opinion which is what impressed me about the movie buoyed by excellent naturalistic performances and understated direction from SoletSolet has made an impressive feature one of the most interesting horror films of the year in my opinion. To go along with that Anchor Bay stepped up and released a very good release jam packed with features on the production,, the making of, the creation of the score and one for the films reception at Sundance. Theres also a commentary with Solet. All of this though is rounded off with an good presentation on the audio video front.

People were supposedly fainting at the screenings, screams of terror were commonplace....To a Horror fan, talk like that is akin to putting a pipe in front of a recovering Crack addict. Who can resist buzz like that?The premise of GRACE is certainly an original and compelling one: When her baby dies In Utero, a young widow keeps the baby alive through the force of her will, but that seemingly normal baby has somewhat.....unusual....feeding requirements.As I said, a great premise. The execution leaves a lot to be desired, though.Writer/Director Paul Solet makes a critical blunder early on in the film by having Grace's Father die in the accident that causes the Miscarriage. Which leaves the remainder of the film as a mostly one-woman show, with Jordan Ladd walking around crying while holding a prosthetic baby. Ladd is simply not a good enough actress to carry off the histrionics required of her, let alone carry them off without a better Actor or Actress to bounce off of. The film seems like an episeode of TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE, stretched to feature-length by adding in the Lesbian subplot and scenes of a senior citizen pumping her breasts in an attempt to re-establish her milk flow. Weird stuff, but ultimately pointless. I was bored for much of the film, with only the very last scene providing any real interest.

Where ""Inside"" was intense and kept you on the edge of your chair for 90 minutes, ""Grace"" is more disturbing, and has you squirming in your seat for that hour and half.""Grace"" starts off simply with a young couple expecting their first child, they've had trouble conceiving and want the best for their unborn daughter. They are very picky about the medical care she's receiving, switch doctors and finally settling on a mid-wife for prenatal care and delivery. Mom is avoiding red meat, caffine and taking up the vegan lifestyle. All the new-age, best for baby crap they've been shoveling down expectant mothers' throats for the past decade, these folks are doing. But all of the goes out the window real quick after a car accident seems to kill the baby while still in the womb. The mom heartbroken decides to carry the infant to term and deliver the dead child as if it were stillborn. The only hitch is that the baby isn't dead. The baby is alive.....and hungry.The movie takes so many twists and turns, and each one progressively more disturbing than the last. Jordan Ladd who is stunning to look at, turns in a top notch performance as the expectant mother who will do anything for her young baby, playing the character as part victim and part nutjob perfectly. The rest of the cast do a great job as well. The gore flows pretty freely, and seeing a beautiful little baby girl plopped into some of these scenes will have even the die-hard gore hounds squirming a bit.Don't go into ""Grace"" expecting something edge of your seat like ""Inside"" or corny fun like ""It's Alive"", ""Grace"" creates an unsettling tone from the beginning and just keeps chugging forward.

This one is worth a look, if you're a fan of the type of film, like Rosemary's baby, which typifies a mother's need to do anything for her child. Clearly that notion is taken to an extreme here, but the film does capture the subsequent psychosis experienced, when a mother goes to deadly lengths to sustain her child. The bond between the mother and child is framed against a Lesbian subplot, which I felt, was a bit superflous (and I am gay, in Civil Union). It didn't really add anything to the story, and no background info was provided to have that portion of the film integrate well. The ""angst"" of a mother, in assuring that her child is safe, despite obvious extreme circumstances was captured well in this flick, and the music, sound effects and lightening added to the overall foreboding and ""dark"" mood and tone of the film.

1266970,A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M,B002FUI4U6,Dr. E,"[3, 7]","Let's begin with originality (or the entire lack thereof): When I spied the baby-bottle filled with blood (check-out the actual film ""poster"" at IMDB), I was already concerned. This is not a novel idea. Shinya Tsukamoto's showcased this visual (with similar vampiric purpose) inMarebito(2004). Now, I can nearly forgive a recycled concept (I'm sure the ""artists"" were not anticipating an audience fluent in world-cinema), but what I cannot excuse is the unapologetic reliance on Polanski. Let's begin with the tea-infuser (which multiple close-ups suggest contain some manner of daemonic components). This is all too reminiscent of the pendent given to Rosemary Woodhouse by the Castevets (Rosemary's Baby). In Rosemary's case, the metal ball contains Tannis Root ... in Madeline Matheson's case, well, who knows (so much is left deliberately vague ... but, over and over, this approach does not work in favor of the novice filmmaker). That moment alone could be labeled an homage ... fine. Nonetheless, the use of yellow costuming on Ladd's character (and then on the nefarious doctor) ... bad move. Farrow's yellow clothing was meant to underscore her ""innocence"" ... and then when other characters in Polanski's work begin wearing yellow, the audience is meant to reassess Farrow's character. It is there to disorient ... and to make the audience question her sanity. Here, it's a mess. Enough said.Technical details: I am always loathe to dissect the missteps of ""B"" films. These pieces are made to entertain a niche audience. And, they are usually successful. Nonetheless, this film has several moments which qualify as HUGE technical blunders ... ones which immediate disengage the audience. Perhaps one of the ""best"" (and funniest) is the stock footage for/of Jones (the cat). In the scene where a masticated mouse is found in the crib, the film cuts to the cat ... just a cat in the grass. I literally burst into giggles. And, typically, we who love ""B"" films look forward to these moments. However, the ""uber-serious"" tone of this film renders this moment less amusing and more (MUCH MORE) embarrassing. (As does the prop baby ... over and over and over). Perhaps equally as problematic are the voice-overs. They are a complete mess. On at least three occasions, it felt like I was watching a poorly overdubbed Godzilla film. There is no excuse for this type of sloppiness. At all.Storyline: As with all film, both tiny and big mistakes can be overlooked if the story is compelling. Unfortunately, this was one of the most mundane, excruciating scripts I've seen in ages. The character-development is non-existent (it's not enough to operate under the ""everyone is a nut"" theory), the notion of a parasitic baby is painfully cliche, and the actual trajectory of the work ... trainwreck. I have seen successful films with a fraction of the $5,000,000 budget granted to Grace (yes, that's the actual number). So, the problem does NOT reside in financial issues. This is a horrific (not in the ""good way"") collision of terrible direction and equally terrible writing. And, sadly, a waste of money (and talent ... because the actors CLEARLY devoted themselves to these bad, bad roles).If you're looking for a great film exploring the horrors of pregnancy/motherhood ... buy Polanski's Rosemary's Baby. Or Donner'sThe Omen. Want to see a daemonic baby? Snyder'sDawn of the Dead. A funny daemonic baby? Jackson'sDead Alive. But, please, do not buy this DVD. (Rent it, if you must).

1266971,A1EGZYG8PC51U5,B002FUI4U6,"D. Wilson ""SonRisedInTheEast""","[3, 5]","I'm not completely sure about this... but hype may have hurt this flick a little bit.  Of course, when the subject matter for your film is an ""undead"" baby that needs to feed on human blood for survival?  I suppose the hype was going to be there, just not sure it was truly deserved(and how about the talk of people fainting while watching this in the theater?) and probably had many people(myself included) expecting something different than what it actually turned out to be(in other words, if you're a fellow horror fan who has been enjoying Frances most recent output like Inside and Martyrs... this'll be hardly memorable).  Grace tells the tale of a mother desperately seeking her first child after several tries.  Inevitably disaster strikes once again and she is involved in a car accident that kills the baby inside her.  In a total ""yeah right"" moment, she decides to wait the 3 weeks and give natural birth rather than the normal procedure of immediate extraction.  Inexplicably(and never revealed later in the film either) the baby comes to life shortly after being born, just as happy and healthy as any other child... her name is Grace.  From there we're introduced to a host of bizarre characters(a mother-in-law obsessed with breast feeding, a doctor obsessed with breast milk, and a lesbian mid-wife), and baby Grace's unusual traits-- smelling foul, attracting flies, and the need to consume human blood for survival.  From here on the movie meanders back-and-forth between the rigors of real life motherhood and those of an ""undead"" baby for about an hour or so before things get moving for the stretch run.  Grace is kind of a strange film in that the subject matter is clearly the kind of thing that get fans of horror and trashy cult cinema foaming at the mouth(... and there's that hype thing I mentioned earlier), but here director Paul Solet has chosen to deliver it in as classy a manner as he can(with more emphasis on the characters than anything actually offensive or gut-churning).  So ultimately what you're left with is a few macabre moments that lead up the the eventual gruesome finale(the movie really does play out like a long dirty joke that ends with a slightly amusing, but more groan-worthy, punch line).  Still, Grace is a pretty good movie with solid acting, music, FX, and direction... just don't go in believing the hype and you should be fine(and for those on the hunt for something actually obscene and offensive with the similar subject matter I'd recommend Baby Blood, Inside, Baby Blues, and the absolutely fantastic Roger Corman produced and Brooke Adams starring flick from 1991, The Unborn).",3,Slightly scarier than changing poopy diapers(2.5 stars),1254614400,"10 4, 2009",2009,2643,"[""'m"", 'not', 'completely', 'sure', 'hype', 'may', 'have', 'hurt', 'flick', 'little', 'bit', 'course', 'when', 'subject', 'matter', 'film', 'undead', 'baby', 'feed', 'human', 'blood', 'survival', 'suppose', 'hype', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'there', 'just', 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'truly', 'deserved', 'how', 'talk', 'people', 'fainting', 'watching', 'theater', 'probably', 'had', 'many', 'people', 'included', 'expecting', 'something', 'different', 'what', 'actually', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'other', 'words', ""'re"", 'fellow', 'horror', 'fan', 'who', 'been', 'enjoying', 'Frances', 'most', 'recent', 'output', 'Inside', 'Martyrs', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hardly', 'memorable', 'Grace', 'tale', 'mother', 'desperately', 'seeking', 'first', 'child', 'several', 'tries', 'Inevitably', 'disaster', 'strikes', 'once', 'again', 'involved', 'car', 'accident', 'baby', 'total', 'yeah', 'right', 'moment', 'wait', '3', 'weeks', 'give', 'natural', 'birth', 'rather', 'normal', 'procedure', 'immediate', 'extraction', 'Inexplicably', 'never', 'revealed', 'later', 'film', 'baby', 'life', 'shortly', 'being', 'born', 'just', 'happy', 'healthy', 'other', 'child', 'name', 'Grace', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'host', 'bizarre', 'characters', 'mother-in-law', 'obsessed', 'breast', 'feeding', 'doctor', 'obsessed', 'breast', 'milk', 'lesbian', 'mid-wife', 'baby', 'Grace', 'unusual', 'traits', 'smelling', 'foul', 'attracting', 'flies', 'need', 'consume', 'human', 'blood', 'survival', 'here', 'movie', 'back-and-forth', 'rigors', 'real', 'life', 'motherhood', 'undead', 'baby', 'hour', 'so', 'things', 'get', 'moving', 'stretch', 'run', 'Grace', 'kind', 'strange', 'film', 'subject', 'matter', 'clearly', 'kind', 'thing', 'get', 'fans', 'horror', 'trashy', 'cult', 'cinema', 'foaming', 'mouth', 'hype', 'thing', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'here', 'director', 'Paul', 'Solet', 'chosen', 'deliver', 'classy', 'manner', 'can', 'more', 'emphasis', 'characters', 'anything', 'actually', 'offensive', 'gut-churning', 'So', 'ultimately', 'what', ""'re"", 'left', 'few', 'macabre', 'moments', 'lead', 'eventual', 'gruesome', 'finale', 'movie', 'really', 'play', 'out', 'long', 'dirty', 'joke', 'slightly', 'amusing', 'more', 'groan-worthy', 'punch', 'line', 'Still', 'Grace', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'solid', 'acting', 'music', 'FX', 'direction', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'believing', 'hype', 'should', 'be', 'fine', 'hunt', 'something', 'actually', 'obscene', 'offensive', 'similar', 'subject', 'matter', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'Baby', 'Blood', 'Inside', 'Baby', 'Blues', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'produced', 'Brooke', 'Adams', 'starring', 'flick', '1991', 'Unborn']",N/A

In our opinion, Grace is classified as a horror film, surfacing all the fears and negative emotions every woman goes through as she decides to get pregnant and form a family.The cast brings Jordan Ladd, Stephen Park, Gabrielle Rose, Malcolm Stewart, Samantha Ferris and others into the story of a woman desperate to conceive and bring a child to term.Madeline Matheson has a rather overpowering mother in law, who insists that she eat well during her pregnancy but Madeline is vegetarian and will not eat meat. Her mother in law also wants her to go to a regular hospital for care and because she has had bad experiences before, Madeline seeks the support of a mid-wife and we see them visit and inspecting a home ""mid-wife"" environment where they ultimately choose to deliver their baby.The plot thickens for there are complications and we realize that she is right about being hesitant of hospitals, but on the way back home the couple has an accident and tragedy takes the life of her husband, leaving Madeline alone.Without giving the plot away... things turned so horrific that we had to walk away from seeing the movie to the end.If you like horror, we do not, this movie would be something to watch.

Madeline finds herself blessed to be pregnant with her daughter who she has named Grace.  She wants her friend, who is a midwife, to deliver Grace.  Only the conniving, obnoxious, overbearing mother-in-law (Vivian Matheson) is dead set on Madeline giving birth in a ""real"" hospital.Unfortunately, a tragic car accident kills Michael and Grace.  The manic depressed Madeline insists on carrying the dead baby to full term.  The baby is delivered but it is not dead, neither is it alive.  Grace craves human blood, and Madeline will do anything to make sure she gets it.""Grace"" caused quite a stir at the Sundance Festival when two men fainted during its premiere screening.  The young director, Paul Solet, couldn't have asked for better publicity.  I'm not too surprised by this incident.  ""Grace"" is a genuinely creepy, bizarre film that is very tense.  It has an atmosphere of dread.  Most of the bloody violence occurs in the Matheson house where Madeline has isolated herself from the rest of the world, determined to feed Grace and prevent anyone from taking her away.  Like best-selling author Stephen King, Solet has taken an everyday event that is suppose to be normal and happy and turned it into something truly horrifying.Excellent performances are given by all the lead actors.  Newcomer Jordan Ladd is convincing as the mom who is desperate to provide for her baby, despite the monstrosity that it has become.  The film chronicles the depths of depravity into which Madeline will sink.  ""Grace"" is very reminiscent of such classics as Roman Polanski's ""Rosemary's Baby,"" Dario Argento's ""Phenomena"" (a.k.a. ""Creepers"") and especially Larry Cohen's shocker ""It's Alive.""  In the latter, the mutant baby goes on a killing spree.  In ""Grace,"" it is the baby's mother that murders.A special award should be given to veteran actress Gabrielle Rose (""The Stepfather"" and ""Lost Boys: The Tribe"") for her excellent portrayal as Vivian Matheson, the evil mother-in-law.  I understood why Madeline detested and feared her.  I hated her myself.  The viewer will fill much sympathy towards Madeline as she struggles to keep Grace out of Vivian's clutches.""Grace"" is a provocative, gruesome film with an open, downbeat ending that is a must see for all fans of modern horror.  Fans of zombie horror films will definitely want to view this one.

1266977,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B002FUI4U6,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[2, 4]","While more subdued and slower-paced than the shocking short, this feature-length Grace still packs a punch. The woman-centric issues of pregnancy and self-sacrificing motherhood are rarely featured in horror, so it's nice to see these addressed. The bond between a mother and child are strong, so like Madeline, I'm willing to bet you would sacrifice everything and anything for them. Madeline breaks her own ethical beliefs to ensure that Grace gets what she hungers for...blood...and is prepared to stop anyone that would try to take her baby away. Sacrifice and a mother's bond to her child are just a few of the many themes explored in Grace and are among the many intelligent layers to this intriguing film.Grace tells the story of Madeline (Jordan Ladd) and Michael (Stephen Park), a married couple trying to conceive a baby. When Madeline finally gets pregnant, she is determined to deliver the baby au natural with a midwife instead of going to a hospital, much to the chagrin of her meddling and traditional mother-in-law, Vivian (Gabrielle Rose). Madeline is also a committed vegan and is very eco-conscious, which irks Vivian even more.Though Grace isn't your ""typical"" horror film, the script and story are smart and I squeamishly enjoyed its many different layers, including the ""meat is murder"" subtext that peppers the film (the real footage of animals being slaughtered/tortured will unnerve many). The character of Madeline was well-written as she was strong, resolute and firm in all her beliefs - beliefs that would soon be challenged by her bloodthirsty monster of an infant. And yet, the film never falls into being an exploitative ""killer baby"" picture, but maintains a somber, tragic and straightforward tone throughout its running time.Besides excelling at writing a compelling script and engaging characters, Solet's direction is also impeccable. The sharp contrast between the early scenes that are bathed in bright sunshine and warm colors and later scenes where shots are veiled in shadows, sickly greens and muted colors complements the accompanying action perfectly. There are also great shots showing Grace's room adorned with fly traps and the birthing scene itself is quite traumatic.Solet has taken a dramatic turn away from the current crop of immediate, in-your-face mainstream ""horror"" that scares with jumpy editing and fake frights. Instead, he has crafted a restrained film that manages to crawl under your skin and squirm there, increasing the discomfort until the satisfying finale. It's not a perfect film by any means, and is definitely not for everyone, but it is a very well-done and quiet character study that shows off Solet's skill as both as a writer and director as well as the amazing range of its actors. ""Grace"" slowly gestates, until it ripens from quiet character study to full-blown horror show. If you can enjoy the slowly unfolding dread, Grace definitely delivers.",4,3.5--I can relate to this film being that I'm a mother of two,1254873600,"10 7, 2009",2009,2924,"['more', 'subdued', 'slower-paced', 'shocking', 'short', 'feature-length', 'Grace', 'still', 'punch', 'woman-centric', 'issues', 'pregnancy', 'self-sacrificing', 'motherhood', 'are', 'rarely', 'featured', 'horror', 'nice', 'see', 'addressed', 'bond', 'mother', 'child', 'are', 'strong', 'like', 'Madeline', ""'m"", 'willing', 'bet', 'would', 'sacrifice', 'everything', 'anything', 'Madeline', 'own', 'ethical', 'beliefs', 'ensure', 'Grace', 'what', 'blood', 'prepared', 'stop', 'anyone', 'would', 'try', 'take', 'baby', 'away', 'Sacrifice', 'mother', 'bond', 'child', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'many', 'themes', 'explored', 'Grace', 'are', 'many', 'intelligent', 'layers', 'intriguing', 'film.Grace', 'story', 'Madeline', 'Jordan', 'Ladd', 'Michael', 'Stephen', 'Park', 'married', 'couple', 'trying', 'conceive', 'baby', 'When', 'Madeline', 'finally', 'pregnant', 'determined', 'deliver', 'baby', 'natural', 'midwife', 'instead', 'going', 'hospital', 'much', 'chagrin', 'meddling', 'traditional', 'mother-in-law', 'Vivian', 'Gabrielle', 'Rose', 'Madeline', 'also', 'committed', 'vegan', 'very', 'eco-conscious', 'Vivian', 'even', 'Grace', ""n't"", 'typical', 'horror', 'film', 'script', 'story', 'are', 'smart', 'squeamishly', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'different', 'layers', 'including', 'meat', 'murder', 'subtext', 'film', 'real', 'footage', 'animals', 'being', 'slaughtered/tortured', 'will', 'unnerve', 'many', 'character', 'Madeline', 'was', 'well-written', 'was', 'strong', 'resolute', 'firm', 'beliefs', 'beliefs', 'would', 'soon', 'be', 'challenged', 'bloodthirsty', 'monster', 'infant', 'yet', 'film', 'never', 'being', 'exploitative', 'killer', 'baby', 'picture', 'somber', 'tragic', 'straightforward', 'tone', 'running', 'time.Besides', 'excelling', 'writing', 'compelling', 'script', 'engaging', 'characters', 'Solet', 'direction', 'also', 'impeccable', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'early', 'scenes', 'are', 'bathed', 'bright', 'sunshine', 'warm', 'colors', 'later', 'scenes', 'where', 'shots', 'are', 'veiled', 'shadows', 'sickly', 'greens', 'muted', 'colors', 'accompanying', 'action', 'perfectly', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'shots', 'showing', 'Grace', 'room', 'adorned', 'fly', 'traps', 'birthing', 'scene', 'quite', 'traumatic.Solet', 'taken', 'dramatic', 'turn', 'away', 'current', 'crop', 'immediate', 'in-your-face', 'mainstream', 'horror', 'jumpy', 'editing', 'fake', 'frights', 'Instead', 'crafted', 'restrained', 'film', 'crawl', 'skin', 'squirm', 'there', 'increasing', 'discomfort', 'satisfying', 'finale', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'means', 'definitely', 'not', 'everyone', 'very', 'well-done', 'quiet', 'character', 'study', 'off', 'Solet', 'skill', 'as', 'writer', 'director', 'as', 'well', 'amazing', 'range', 'actors', 'Grace', 'slowly', 'quiet', 'character', 'study', 'full-blown', 'horror', 'show', 'can', 'enjoy', 'slowly', 'unfolding', 'dread', 'Grace', 'definitely']",N/A

Take my reaction as high praise; I've seen so many horror movies over the past forty-odd years that I've become a bit jaded, and it's rare these days for a film to become so psychologically intense that I have to turn my eyes away from the screen to catch my breath.Without giving away any more of the plot than you could learn from reading the DVD sleeve, ""Grace"" tells the story of a young wife whose baby girl dies in the womb and decides to go through the birthing process nonetheless, with the help of an old friend turned midwife.  After the delivery, the bereaved mother seemingly wills the infant to begin breathing ... but it soon turns out that baby Grace redefines the term ""special needs child.""  At this point, Solet's script could easily have veered into schlock; but instead, he begins to ratchet up the tension by concentrating on the emotionally charged interplay between characters, particularly the female characters, all of whom are unusually strong and dynamic.  Playing the young mother, her mother-in-law, and the midwife respectively, actresses Jordan Ladd, Gabrielle Rose, and Samantha Ferris are each superb; together they give this movie extraordinary life.The DVD is superbly mastered and shows off the remarkable talent and commitment that went into the making of this movie, both in front of and behind the cameras.  There are plenty of interesting supplemental featurettes; I especially enjoyed the short ""Grace at Sundance"", which documented Solet's efforts to market the film and generate early buzz.  This DVD is highly recommended, but be warned!  As I indicated earlier, it's definitely not intended for the faint of heart.",4,"Amazing ""Grace""",1253664000,"09 23, 2009",2009,2343,"['had', 'known', 'anything', 'writer-director', 'Paul', 'Solet', 'film', 'advance', 'never', 'million', 'years', 'would', 'have', 'watched', 'alone', 'late', 'night', 'darkened', 'room', 'Oh', 'sure', 'knew', 'vaguely', 'Grace', 'was', 'being', 'marketed', 'horror', 'film', 'guess', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'was', 'run-of-the-mill', 'monster', 'movie', 'over-the-top', 'characters', 'hackneyed', 'roll-your-eyes', 'script', 'lot', 'corny', 'slasher', 'visual', 'effects.Wrong', 'wrong', 'wrong', 'Instead', 'found', 'Grace', 'be', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'meticulously', 'directed', 'intriguingly', 'plotted', 'study', 'human', 'relationships', 'desires', 'left', 'more', 'merely', 'frightened', 'left', 'profoundly', 'uneasy', 'more', 'little', 'queasy', 'Take', 'reaction', 'high', 'praise', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'horror', 'movies', 'past', 'forty-odd', 'years', ""'ve"", 'become', 'bit', 'jaded', 'rare', 'days', 'film', 'become', 'so', 'psychologically', 'intense', 'have', 'turn', 'eyes', 'away', 'screen', 'catch', 'breath.Without', 'giving', 'away', 'more', 'plot', 'could', 'learn', 'reading', 'DVD', 'sleeve', 'Grace', 'story', 'young', 'wife', 'baby', 'girl', 'womb', 'decides', 'go', 'birthing', 'process', 'nonetheless', 'help', 'old', 'friend', 'turned', 'midwife', 'delivery', 'bereaved', 'mother', 'seemingly', 'infant', 'begin', 'breathing', 'soon', 'out', 'baby', 'Grace', 'term', 'special', 'child', 'point', 'Solet', 'script', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'veered', 'schlock', 'instead', 'ratchet', 'up', 'tension', 'concentrating', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'interplay', 'characters', 'particularly', 'female', 'characters', 'whom', 'are', 'unusually', 'strong', 'dynamic', 'Playing', 'young', 'mother', 'mother-in-law', 'midwife', 'respectively', 'Jordan', 'Ladd', 'Gabrielle', 'Rose', 'Samantha', 'Ferris', 'are', 'superb', 'together', 'give', 'movie', 'extraordinary', 'life.The', 'DVD', 'superbly', 'mastered', 'off', 'remarkable', 'talent', 'commitment', 'went', 'making', 'movie', 'front', 'cameras', 'are', 'plenty', 'interesting', 'supplemental', 'featurettes', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'short', 'Grace', 'Sundance', 'documented', 'Solet', 'efforts', 'market', 'film', 'generate', 'early', 'buzz', 'DVD', 'highly', 'recommended', 'be', 'warned', 'indicated', 'earlier', 'definitely', 'not', 'intended', 'faint', 'heart']",N/A

Mike's mother Vivian wants to make sure Madeline has the kid in a hospital but she wants to have a midwife named Patricia (her old lover) deliver it.  But before any of their plans transpire, a freak car accident leaves Mike dead and Maddy her unborn child in some serious trouble.  A few days later her water (er red Flavor Aid) breaks and she's rushed to the midwife's place to have the baby.  Expecting a still birth but a miracle happens and Maddy gives birth to a child that she names Grace.  But that is when things get wonky.  Throw in some strained in-law relationship, a jealous young lesbian, a ghoul baby and a single mother going batty and you have Grace.A mediocre film that pays homage to superior films such as the It's Alive trilogy, Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby.  I didn't care for the characters because they all seem annoying.  The mother-in-law is the chief antagonist who schemes to snatch the baby.  The ex-lover/midwife Patricia is creepy as she keeps tabs on her old lover and only cares about moving in on the now dead Mike's turf.  In one scene she tries to rekindle the old flame a few days after the physically and emotionally exhaustive birth but gets cut off at the overpass and her young squeeze is VERY jealous of the attention that she gives to Madeline.

1266980,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B002FUI4U6,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 1]","Grace is an independent horror film from 2009 that would probably have been better with a higher budget. It's a horror film that wants to rely on atmosphere and simmering suspense to engage the viewer rather than blood and gore, but with a small budget must forsake atmosphere in favor of mystery. The blurb on the back of the DVD is fairly accurate and it does feel a bit like a Stephen King story...Unfortunately, it's like one of his weaker ones:Madeline (Jordan Ladd) and her husband Michael (Stephen Park) are expecting their first baby and plan to deliver with a midwife, instead of a hospital delivery. After a (random) accident, Michael is dead and Madeline discovers that the baby has died inside her. Having already suffered two miscarriages and being overwhelmed with grief, she decides to carry it to term. When the baby is born, it is willed back to life through Maddy's love for it and is named Grace. Upon returning home, everything seems fine until Maddy starts to notice something disturbing about her new baby.As other reviewers have noted, the film doesn't go the way you'd expect with a psychopathic or possessed child. Writer/director Paul Solet is a little more inventive, yet it's his script that is one of the film's weakest points. It's hard to describe what the problem is exactly, as Grace moves at a slow pace yet the film sort of jumps right into the story and begins piling on the twists. It's strange but it doesn't feel like Solet had enough material to fully flesh out his story. At 84 minutes, it's a pretty short film yet it grows fairly tedious. Worse, there's a contrived story element about a former lesbian relationship which adds absolutely nothing to the story and wouldn't have made the characters any less believable without it.For an amateur production with a no-name cast, much of it actually looks pretty impressive. Ladd does a good job as Maddy, making her a believable mother, willing to do anything to protect her child. There are no bad performances here, but Ladd stands out alongside the effective Samantha Ferris as the sassy, smart mid-wife. Gabrielle Rose, as the domineering mother-in-law Vivian also does a commendable job. With this cast, I think Solet would have made a better film if he had evened out his script a bit and had more control over his style as a director. There were times where it appeared he had captured a look that suited his film, but it disappears after a few moments. I blame the lack of budget though, not Solet himself. Another downside is there are scenes that actually reek of straight-to-video, but there is genuine suspense in the last few minutes of the movie and I applaud Solet for not going for an easy shot or story development like many horror directors would.Grace shows Paul Solet's potential to make something really good and it is well-made with an original premise, but it's just not particularly engaging or impressive. There are scenes that are shocking and suspenseful, but many scenes just kind of tread along tediously while the ending, which wants to shock, is ultimately just ""meh."" While Grace isn't a complete waste of time, it's a mostly forgettable horror film that some will appreciate for its originality and many will hate for not meeting their expectations.GRADE: C",3,"Original, But Ultimately Forgettable Horror Film",1300924800,"03 24, 2011",2011,3279,"['Grace', 'independent', 'horror', 'film', '2009', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'higher', 'budget', 'horror', 'film', 'rely', 'atmosphere', 'simmering', 'suspense', 'engage', 'viewer', 'rather', 'blood', 'gore', 'small', 'budget', 'must', 'forsake', 'atmosphere', 'favor', 'mystery', 'blurb', 'back', 'DVD', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'feel', 'bit', 'Stephen', 'King', 'story', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'weaker', 'ones', 'Madeline', 'Jordan', 'Ladd', 'husband', 'Michael', 'Stephen', 'Park', 'are', 'expecting', 'first', 'baby', 'plan', 'deliver', 'midwife', 'instead', 'hospital', 'delivery', 'random', 'accident', 'Michael', 'dead', 'Madeline', 'discovers', 'baby', 'died', 'Having', 'already', 'suffered', 'two', 'miscarriages', 'being', 'overwhelmed', 'grief', 'carry', 'term', 'When', 'baby', 'born', 'willed', 'back', 'life', 'Maddy', 'love', 'named', 'Grace', 'returning', 'home', 'everything', 'fine', 'Maddy', 'notice', 'something', 'disturbing', 'new', 'baby.As', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'film', ""n't"", 'go', 'way', ""'d"", 'expect', 'psychopathic', 'possessed', 'child', 'Writer/director', 'Paul', 'Solet', 'little', 'more', 'inventive', 'script', 'one', 'film', 'weakest', 'points', 'hard', 'describe', 'what', 'problem', 'exactly', 'Grace', 'slow', 'pace', 'yet', 'film', 'sort', 'jumps', 'right', 'story', 'piling', 'twists', 'strange', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Solet', 'had', 'enough', 'material', 'fully', 'flesh', 'out', 'story', '84', 'minutes', 'pretty', 'short', 'film', 'yet', 'fairly', 'tedious', 'Worse', 'contrived', 'story', 'element', 'former', 'lesbian', 'relationship', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'story', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'characters', 'less', 'believable', 'it.For', 'amateur', 'production', 'no-name', 'cast', 'much', 'actually', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'Ladd', 'good', 'job', 'Maddy', 'making', 'believable', 'mother', 'willing', 'do', 'anything', 'protect', 'child', 'are', 'bad', 'performances', 'here', 'Ladd', 'out', 'effective', 'Samantha', 'Ferris', 'sassy', 'smart', 'mid-wife', 'Gabrielle', 'Rose', 'domineering', 'mother-in-law', 'Vivian', 'also', 'commendable', 'job', 'cast', 'think', 'Solet', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'film', 'had', 'evened', 'out', 'script', 'bit', 'had', 'more', 'control', 'style', 'director', 'were', 'times', 'where', 'appeared', 'had', 'captured', 'look', 'suited', 'film', 'few', 'moments', 'blame', 'lack', 'budget', 'not', 'Solet', 'downside', 'are', 'scenes', 'actually', 'straight-to-video', 'genuine', 'suspense', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'movie', 'applaud', 'Solet', 'not', 'going', 'easy', 'shot', 'story', 'development', 'many', 'horror', 'directors', 'would.Grace', 'Paul', 'Solet', 'potential', 'make', 'something', 'really', 'good', 'well-made', 'original', 'premise', 'just', 'not', 'particularly', 'engaging', 'impressive', 'are', 'scenes', 'are', 'shocking', 'suspenseful', 'many', 'scenes', 'just', 'kind', 'tread', 'tediously', 'ending', 'shock', 'ultimately', 'just', 'meh', 'Grace', ""n't"", 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'mostly', 'forgettable', 'horror', 'film', 'will', 'appreciate', 'originality', 'many', 'will', 'hate', 'not', 'meeting', 'expectations.GRADE', 'C']",N/A

1266982,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B002FUI4U6,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[0, 0]","Writer/director Paul Solet serves up a heaping helping of creepiness in his 2009 chiller, ""Grace,"" but an unintended camp factor prevents me from taking it too seriously.  The film opens with a young couple, the Mathesons, successfully conceiving a child.  It's been a hard road for the pair in their attempts to become pregnant, but this time around they are successful.  Michael (Stephen Park), has grudgingly compromised with his wife, Madeline (Jordan Ladd), on having a midwife deliver the child for them.Michael's parents disagree with the use of a midwife and demand that Madeline at least see the family doctor to have her and the baby's health checked on.  Madeline steadfastly refuses to use the doctor and creates quite a divide between herself and her mother-in-law (Gabrielle Rose).  The midwife, meanwhile, also has a history with Madeline, but I won't reveal what that happens to be.As Madeline comes closer to term, there is an auto accident that kills Michael and seemingly terminates Madeline's unborn child as well.  Madeline insists on delivering the baby and despite the suggestions of the midwife, she successfully delivers a stillborn baby......or that's what you might think.Somehow, Madeline ""wills"" her dead baby back to life and names her Grace.  From this point on, the film takes on a very creepy (and dull) tone as Madeline soon discovers that little Grace doesn't want milk.  She wants blood, and lots of it.Meanwhile, Madeline's mother-in-law, Vivian, is having trouble dealing with the loss of her son and feels that Madeline is a poor mother to young Grace.  She takes a number of steps (a few of them bizarre) in order to steal Grace away from Madeline.  This is where the film really becomes unhinged and also where I started struggling to finish it.Solet attempts to keep a serious tone throughout the film, and actually does a fine job of creating an air of creepiness.  However, the fact that we are having to deal with an ""undead"" baby is actually quite hokey and rather boring.  The idea really has a lot of potential, but Solet's intent on keeping this film serious flatlines the story.  The child has to completely depend on its mother (just like a normal baby), and we witness a hardcore vegan spiral out of control and become a murderous mother.  Yep, you heard that right, a vegan becomes flush with bloodlust in the film.  I can see where Solet is trying to get the idea across that a mother will do anything for her child, but a crazed vegan tracking down blood for her baby comes across as a bit too goofy for my tastes.Had Solet turned this film into a cheesy horror flick, I believe the results would have been much better.  Granted, he probably wouldn't have received all the ""praise"" from Sundance, but his movie definitely would have been more enjoyable.Mentioning Sundance, supposedly a couple of audience members actually fainted during a showing of this movie at the film festival.  This is well documented and heavily impressed upon the viewer in one of the many documentaries provided on the DVD.  Perhaps it was the heat in the building or maybe they had low blood sugar, but I found nothing ""faint-tastic"" about ""Grace.""As far as the DVD extras are concerned, there are a number of documentaries (from conception to delivery, literally) that are actually kind of fun to watch.  There is also running commentary available for fans of such things.Overall, ""Grace"" could have been a whole lot better had Solet either dropped the serious tone of the film and embraced the campfest he had on his hands or played with the plot a bit more in order to remove the campy quality of the film.  The cast all do a pretty good job, and Jordan Ladd is very convincing as little Grace's mother.  For her performance and the creepy tone of the film, I give ""Grace"" three stars.

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","""Grace"" is another, in a long line of films, that is somewhat undermined by the expectations that its own packaging and advertising have created. However, that does not mean that the film is unsuccessful at what it sets out to do. Billed as a ""horror"" film, the resultant product is certainly more unsettling than it is scary. With its slow-build pacing, muted color palette, limited dialogue, and eerie soundtrack--""Grace"" establishes a tone that is genuinely creepy and it is this feeling that propelled my interest throughout this flawed, but effective, little chiller. What ""Grace"" does well, it does exceedingly well! And that is to create a disturbing mood.Basically a claustrophobic chamber piece, ""Grace"" tells the story of a young mother (Jordan Ladd) who decides to carry her fetus to term even after it has been killed in a tragic accident. Through belief, love, divine providence, or perhaps something more sinister--the baby actually comes to life after delivery. Joyous to the miracle, it soon becomes apparent that motherhood for this child may not be all its cracked up to be. Ladd, at the film's heart, is certainly a selling point of ""Grace."" Her quiet vulnerability suits the tale well--and her journey to the lowest depths is haunting and believable.The film, however, is not without its problems. Here comes the strange bits! Politically, ""Grace"" may be interpreted as vegan propaganda with gruesome depictions of animal slaughter as the only thing that seems to come in Ladd's cable TV. Add a skewed view of modern medicine (a midwife is used and medical professionals are depicted as clowns), some odd lesbian undertones, and some amateurish supporting performances--and the film threatens to buckle under some of its own idiosyncrasies.Despite its shortcomings, however, I still thought ""Grace"" worked on its own terms.

Taking into account that I was warned on the DVD cover to 'view at my own risk', I have to say it wasn't a bad movie, just a bit convoluted and a tad too bloody for my taste, some of it seemed just gratuitous gore thrown in for shock effect.  I didn't realize that the husband was killed in the car wreck because it wasn't made clear until late in the film when his mother, the bizarre mother-in-law from hell, makes a play to get the baby, even going so far as buying a breast pump and trying to lactate herself so she can feed the baby (little did she know.....)  And it really becomes a total chick flick after the husband's unfortunate demise.The thing that drew me in was the naked power of mother-love that came across in almost visible concentric waves through the screen when the baby is born dead.

A young woman played by former ""Angel"" Cheryl Ladd's daughter (Jordan Ladd) lives with an overbearing husband and a nosy, stereotypically judgmental mother-in-law.  Stress and hormones run high when after many futile attempts she finally becomes pregnant.  Unfortunately shortly before giving birth a terrible accident occurs and Ladd loses her husband and child.  Or does she?  The story takes a slightly preposterous though interesting twist here as Ladd's slightly kooky but sympathetic midwife condones letting the dead baby be released organically.  However when the time comes, Grace is miraculously born both alive and healthy.  However, as one can easily predict she's not a normal child by any means and when crabby, little Grace can get downright nasty.  I wasn't sure if this was going to be a hackneyed version of Cohen's ""It's Alive"" or perhaps Polanski's ""Repulsion"", but ""Grace"" attempts to be neither, managing to stand out on it's own while touching upon some original and startling ideas.  Jordan Ladd gives a powerful and thoughtful performance as the all-giving mother who only wants what's best for her child.  On the downside, there are too many unanswered questions and not enough story to make this the satisfying viewing that it had the potential to be.

It has raw horror combined with a psychological component that makes this movie intensely creepy and engulfing.The movie follows the tragedy of a mother that has to carry her stillborn baby to term. But, when the baby is born, it is alive. And I mean `it' and not `she', because there is something seriously wrong with baby Grace, she does not want her mother's milk, she wants her mother's blood.At first, I truly doubted that I would like this film; I did not even take it seriously. Then, I found myself being drawn in to the plot, the sick and disturbed plot. This is definitely not for the faint of heart because it will freak you out. Not because of the blood or the scenes; what is truly terrifying about this movie is the sheer possibility of it, the way it messes with your psyche.My big complaint about this movie is the under-development of the characters, specifically Patricia and the mother-in-law, Vivian (played by Gabrielle Rose). Although Samantha Ferirs performed her part marvelously, we did not see enough of her. Also, we never truly to delve into Vivian's psyche and that could have been far more interesting that the entire movie. Also, the film itself could have been better developed. The cinematography, the score and the tempo of the film were pretty good. The other flaw is the randomness of the Vegan aspect of Madeline's diet (the main character). It was unnecessary and irrelevant.The DVD extras are good. 'Grace: Conception' is a nice and short featurette about how this movie came to be.  'Grace: Delivery' gives you a nice beyond the scenes about the making of the movie. 'Grace: Family' answers a lot of questions about the character's relations that were never answered in the movie.The big flaw of this DVD is that it does not contain the original short film that spawned this movie.The other featurettes are Grace at Sundance, Her Mother's Eyes (about the production design), Look of Grace, Lullaby Scoring Grace.Also, the DVD case is made out of recycled material.",3,Good suspenseful psych and horror film,1255305600,"10 12, 2009",2009,2035,"[""'Grace"", 'good', 'horror', 'film', 'raw', 'horror', 'combined', 'psychological', 'component', 'movie', 'intensely', 'creepy', 'engulfing.The', 'movie', 'tragedy', 'mother', 'carry', 'stillborn', 'baby', 'term', 'when', 'baby', 'born', 'alive', 'mean', 'not', 'something', 'seriously', 'wrong', 'baby', 'Grace', 'not', 'want', 'mother', 'milk', 'mother', 'blood.At', 'first', 'truly', 'doubted', 'would', 'like', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'take', 'seriously', 'Then', 'found', 'being', 'drawn', 'plot', 'sick', 'disturbed', 'plot', 'definitely', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'will', 'freak', 'out', 'Not', 'blood', 'scenes', 'what', 'truly', 'terrifying', 'movie', 'sheer', 'possibility', 'way', 'psyche.My', 'big', 'complaint', 'movie', 'under-development', 'characters', 'specifically', 'Patricia', 'mother-in-law', 'Vivian', 'played', 'Gabrielle', 'Rose', 'Samantha', 'Ferirs', 'performed', 'part', 'marvelously', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'enough', 'Also', 'never', 'truly', 'delve', 'Vivian', 'psyche', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'entire', 'movie', 'Also', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'developed', 'cinematography', 'score', 'tempo', 'film', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'other', 'flaw', 'randomness', 'Vegan', 'aspect', 'Madeline', 'diet', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'irrelevant.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'good', ""'Grace"", 'Conception', 'nice', 'short', 'featurette', 'how', 'movie', 'came', 'be', ""'Grace"", 'Delivery', 'nice', 'scenes', 'making', 'movie', ""'Grace"", 'Family', 'answers', 'lot', 'questions', 'character', 'relations', 'were', 'never', 'answered', 'movie.The', 'big', 'flaw', 'DVD', 'not', 'contain', 'original', 'short', 'film', 'spawned', 'movie.The', 'other', 'featurettes', 'are', 'Grace', 'Sundance', 'Her', 'Mother', 'Eyes', 'production', 'design', 'Look', 'Grace', 'Lullaby', 'Scoring', 'Grace.Also', 'DVD', 'case', 'made', 'recycled', 'material']",N/A

1266994,A1CKY01WDLN1DK,B002FUI4U6,M. Zveris,"[1, 1]","*This review contains spoilers of the non-vegetarian variety*Grace is one of those movies that will probably be far more disturbing to a woman than a man.  That being said, disturbing is about where this movie ends at being worthwhile.  It isn't a terrible film, and I'm not sure it could have been presented any better.  There is something indefinable that grates on the nerves, if I had to try and put a finger on it that would probably be how unsubtly we are drawn toward the inevitable conclusion of the film.That may have been the titular problem of Grace, the fact that while it contains many things that women would find horrifying the film is determined to beat you over the head with them, making the gut wrenching grotesqueries ultimately laughable.  The way that Grace is presented; an undead baby that has to feed on living blood, is painful.  Especially when we take into account how deeply the mother wanted a baby and how important this was to her family.  Throwing in the judgmental mother in law, ethical quandaries of a vegan main character, and creepily obsessed ex-girlfriend, and we're left with something very disturbing.Unfortunately for all the simplicity of the way the film was made the effects are at times difficult to get along with.  Some of the flies are so fake it's painful, because Grace is a movie that has a very raw and honest appearance.  When you have almost no special effects it is important that those put into the film flow.  You end up losing the suspension of disbelief that the movie requires, and are left almost laughing at the actions of the harried mother.I really wanted to like Grace, while the ending was strangely annoying to me - after all how are you going to handle a toddler eating others, she can't breastfeed forever - the film had some very good points.  The agony of the main character is very real and her desire to keep her child healthy and fit is also important.  Her neurotic obsessive vegan behavior was more than slightly grating, but she's a bit insane...that's a given!Unfortunately within five minutes of the end credits I began to think on all the ways the movie wasn't believable to me.  It was too over the top, too obvious, and resolved so suddenly with such a prolonged buildup and inevitably if a movie is going to leave you with that feeling it probably isn't worth watching more than once.Is Grace a terrible film?

Durham ""Big Evil""","[0, 0]","Before you think anything about Grace before actually seeing it, let me get it out of the way by saying that if you're expecting something among the lines of Larry Cohen's It's Alive, you'll be pretty disappointed. Instead, writer/director Paul Solet crafts a horrifying yet strangely touching tale that is definitely something different. Jordan Ladd stars as Madeline, who after losing her husband (Stephen Park) in a car accident, learns that her unborn daughter is dead inside her as well. Determined to carry her stillborn child to term regardless, Madeline (and everyone else) are shocked when the baby miraculously comes back to life upon its birth. However, not all is right with baby Grace, as Madeline learns that her infant has a hunger for blood. Madeline's love for her child finds her doing all sorts of things, as her intrusive and controlling mother in law (Gabrielle Rose) seeks to take Grace from her, and as you can probably guess by now, things don't tend to go to well for anyone involved. Filled with subtle commentary on femininity and vegan lifestyle, Grace ends up being more than a horror movie, although it doesn't come up short in terms of supplying horrifying, disturbing, and disgusting images. Ladd and Rose both give courageous performances, and the end result of the film leaves you feeling haunted, and even nauseated. All in all, Grace is something that is definitely not for everyone in the least, but if you're feeling brave enough and are looking for something of a different flavor, Grace is worth seeing.",4,"Inventive, disturbing, and definitely not for everyone",1254441600,"10 2, 2009",2009,1543,"['think', 'anything', 'Grace', 'actually', 'seeing', 'let', 'get', 'way', 'saying', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'something', 'lines', 'Larry', 'Cohen', 'Alive', ""'ll"", 'be', 'pretty', 'disappointed', 'Instead', 'writer/director', 'Paul', 'Solet', 'crafts', 'horrifying', 'yet', 'strangely', 'touching', 'tale', 'definitely', 'something', 'different', 'Jordan', 'Ladd', 'Madeline', 'who', 'losing', 'husband', 'Stephen', 'Park', 'car', 'accident', 'unborn', 'daughter', 'dead', 'inside', 'as', 'well', 'Determined', 'carry', 'stillborn', 'child', 'term', 'regardless', 'Madeline', 'everyone', 'else', 'are', 'shocked', 'when', 'baby', 'miraculously', 'back', 'life', 'birth', 'However', 'not', 'right', 'baby', 'Grace', 'Madeline', 'infant', 'hunger', 'blood', 'Madeline', 'love', 'child', 'doing', 'sorts', 'things', 'intrusive', 'controlling', 'mother', 'law', 'Gabrielle', 'Rose', 'take', 'Grace', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'now', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'tend', 'go', 'well', 'anyone', 'involved', 'Filled', 'subtle', 'commentary', 'femininity', 'vegan', 'lifestyle', 'Grace', 'up', 'being', 'more', 'horror', 'movie', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'short', 'terms', 'supplying', 'horrifying', 'disturbing', 'disgusting', 'images', 'Ladd', 'Rose', 'give', 'courageous', 'performances', 'end', 'result', 'film', 'feeling', 'haunted', 'even', 'nauseated', 'Grace', 'something', 'definitely', 'not', 'everyone', 'least', ""'re"", 'feeling', 'brave', 'enough', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'different', 'flavor', 'Grace', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A
1266996,A1U4VN19O89I3U,B002FUI4U6,"Nick S ""Film, Book and Music Freak""","[8, 9]","Babies are considered the hope for the future. However, in the realm of horror movie filmmaking, ever since the 1968 masterpiece Rosemary's Baby they are used instead either as a source of fear and even sometimes as an omen of impending apocalypse. While Grace is a film that fits into the tiny maternal-fright genre, it is sadly more of an inferior, schlock fest than the glowing Sundance advance reviews would have you believe. What a pity.The plot of Grace concerns a mother's relationship with her baby of the title. Grace is the kind of baby that needs special food. No, one does not mean organic. It is rather that of the red kind.While Rosemary's Baby had its psychological angle to freak out its audience, and It's Alive, though not great by any means, had a fun and campy sense to its material, Grace seems to want to play it completely straight in both tone and plot structure, a bit like The Brood. Problem is, despite this exact plot never being quite done before, the film still feels pretty ordinary.Grace just never rises above its rote mechanics. It feels at if it tries to coast on its disturbing themes, but despite an eerie music score, the film barely emotes. It chooses to behave in a way any horror genre connoisseur thinks it will, but this also leaves it without depth or originality, and Grace is hardly even fun or thrilling. It may try to go with a slow-buildup, but things do not exactly simmer interestingly, and any real themes on the subject of motherhood and nursing etc. seem petite. Furthermore, the splatter feels routine and much too easy.Structure wise Grace is also comparable to Lucky McKee's film, May, in terms of slow-crawl buildup to a blood-spilling finish. Yet, director Paul Solet lacks that uncanny wit that McKee displayed so efficiently. Moreover, Solet also shows his narrow-mindedness further when the film ends with one of those annoying tacked on shocks only present to set up a sequel.This end is also too telling: as this also shows that one can guess each plot turn the movie will take in more non-thrilling and scare-lacking ways. For that reason, Grace should never be considered a standout student in classroom for any filmmaking generation to come.Grade: 3.5 / 10 (In 0.5 Increments)",2,My Review as on Unrated Magazine.com,1254528000,"10 3, 2009",2009,2243,"['Babies', 'are', 'considered', 'hope', 'future', 'However', 'realm', 'horror', 'movie', 'filmmaking', 'ever', '1968', 'masterpiece', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'are', 'used', 'instead', 'either', 'source', 'fear', 'even', 'sometimes', 'omen', 'impending', 'apocalypse', 'Grace', 'film', 'tiny', 'maternal-fright', 'genre', 'sadly', 'more', 'inferior', 'schlock', 'fest', 'glowing', 'Sundance', 'advance', 'reviews', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'What', 'pity.The', 'plot', 'Grace', 'mother', 'relationship', 'baby', 'title', 'Grace', 'kind', 'baby', 'special', 'food', 'No', 'one', 'not', 'mean', 'organic', 'rather', 'red', 'kind.While', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'had', 'psychological', 'angle', 'freak', 'out', 'audience', 'Alive', 'not', 'great', 'means', 'had', 'fun', 'campy', 'sense', 'material', 'Grace', 'want', 'play', 'completely', 'straight', 'tone', 'plot', 'structure', 'bit', 'Brood', 'Problem', 'exact', 'plot', 'never', 'being', 'quite', 'done', 'before', 'film', 'still', 'pretty', 'ordinary.Grace', 'just', 'never', 'rote', 'mechanics', 'coast', 'disturbing', 'themes', 'eerie', 'music', 'score', 'film', 'barely', 'behave', 'way', 'horror', 'genre', 'connoisseur', 'will', 'also', 'depth', 'originality', 'Grace', 'hardly', 'even', 'fun', 'thrilling', 'may', 'try', 'go', 'slow-buildup', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'exactly', 'simmer', 'interestingly', 'real', 'themes', 'subject', 'motherhood', 'nursing', 'etc', 'seem', 'petite', 'Furthermore', 'splatter', 'feels', 'routine', 'much', 'too', 'easy.Structure', 'wise', 'Grace', 'also', 'comparable', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'film', 'May', 'terms', 'slow-crawl', 'buildup', 'blood-spilling', 'finish', 'director', 'Paul', 'Solet', 'uncanny', 'wit', 'McKee', 'displayed', 'so', 'efficiently', 'Moreover', 'Solet', 'also', 'narrow-mindedness', 'further', 'when', 'film', 'one', 'annoying', 'tacked', 'shocks', 'only', 'present', 'set', 'up', 'sequel.This', 'end', 'also', 'too', 'telling', 'also', 'one', 'can', 'guess', 'plot', 'turn', 'movie', 'will', 'take', 'more', 'non-thrilling', 'scare-lacking', 'ways', 'reason', 'Grace', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'considered', 'standout', 'student', 'classroom', 'filmmaking', 'generation', 'come.Grade', '3.5', '10', '0.5', 'Increments']",N/A

Realistic characters.A little slow to start, but builds nicely to the not quite what you'd expect ending.  Don't worry, I won't spoil it for you!  Read the Amazon synopsis for a plot line.  I liked it.  GRACE is an above average, low(er) budget horror film.  If people running around while being chased is your thing, you probably will find GRACE not to your liking.

It does not set you up for any roller-coaster ride, nor does it has a million and one flash cut edits, but rather moves towards its ending with a certain tone that is more shivering than horrific.It is a twisted tale of a mother's love whose power exceeds that of anyone's imagination. After a tragic accident leaving the unborn baby lifeless inside her, Madeline Matheson (Jordan Ladd) decides to carry out the term of her pregnancy with a mid-wife. Once born, however, her love has brought back the child to life - but with unexpected consequences. Once the grandmother gets curious to see the child, things start to get a little bit more complicated.The child seems to no longer need mothers milk, but rather blood to sustain its life. Very eerie and strange what a mother will go through to satisfy her child, and here is a film that will make you wonder to what extent you might go to save your child.GRACE is well made and designed, and put together by first time director Paul Solet who also wrote the script, is a satisfying entry into the horror genre. Although there is plenty of blood in this film, it is not really a gory film, nor do I get the sense that this film is attempting at exploiting the genre in any way, which is why it came off more genuine than other horror films. I think the film could be worked out to be scarier, perhaps by building more emotional connection to the characters as they seemed a little on the two dimensional side. They had motivations for their actions, but they did not seem to be based on anything other than because the script said so.For me, this title is a better rental than buying as I dont feel like its a movie I would return to often.

1267003,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B002FUI4U6,RMurray847,"[2, 4]","GRACE is a horror movie that really isn't terribly well done.  The pacing is quite slow and the acting is marginal.  But what it lacks in sheen and style, one could argue that achieves in sheer ""wrongness.""  It is a squirm-inducing film because it takes some cherished institutions such as motherhood, babies and mothers nursing their babies...and twists them in ways that are simply uncomfortable.Madeline (Jordan Ladd) is a young woman who very much wants to have a child.  She's married to a nice but terribly bland guy (and when we find out later that Madeline had previously been involved in a fairly hot and heavy lesbian relationship...we suspect her hubby is just a DNA donor)...but her life seems complete when she is finally pregnant.  Madeline is a vegan who spends good chunks of her day watching documentaries on TV about the animal processing industry.  ""Porn for vegans,"" she calls it.  She shuns doctors and hospitals, and plans for a water birth at the home of a midwife (Samantha Ferris, ""Supernatural"") who is on the fringes.Then, in her eighth month, a terrible accident occurs and her life is turned upside down.  Her baby is dead, but she is determined to carry it to term.  And when the baby, Grace, arrives, she is able to practically will it to live.  But the price of keeping her baby alive is an icky one.I've deliberately left most details out of this description, but let's just say that the movie presents horrific and unpleasant breast-feeding, fair amounts of blood used in ways that could make one queasy and lots of other twists on the theme of maternal instincts gone terribly askew.  Not only does Madeline suffer or indulge (depending on one's point of view), her mother-in-law begins to have urges that take normally pure & lovely instincts and twists them into something ugly.Viewing GRACE is not exactly a pleasant experience.  If I were to describe the details of the events, it might actually sound deeply silly.  (And the film does have a tentative dose of black humor.)  But there's just something so uncomfortable about watching much of this, that I have to say it might be worth watching if you're in the mood to have your feelings about the bonds between mother and infant turned into a horror show.",3,"Not really great, but can be quite uncomfortable when twisting the bonds of mother & baby",1284768000,"09 18, 2010",2010,2246,"['GRACE', 'horror', 'movie', 'really', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'well', 'done', 'pacing', 'quite', 'slow', 'acting', 'marginal', 'what', 'sheen', 'style', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'sheer', 'wrongness', 'squirm-inducing', 'film', 'cherished', 'institutions', 'such', 'motherhood', 'babies', 'mothers', 'nursing', 'babies', 'ways', 'are', 'simply', 'uncomfortable.Madeline', 'Jordan', 'Ladd', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'very', 'much', 'have', 'child', 'married', 'nice', 'terribly', 'bland', 'guy', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'later', 'Madeline', 'had', 'previously', 'been', 'involved', 'fairly', 'hot', 'heavy', 'lesbian', 'relationship', 'suspect', 'hubby', 'just', 'DNA', 'donor', 'life', 'complete', 'when', 'finally', 'pregnant', 'Madeline', 'vegan', 'who', 'good', 'chunks', 'day', 'watching', 'documentaries', 'TV', 'animal', 'processing', 'industry', 'Porn', 'vegans', 'doctors', 'hospitals', 'plans', 'water', 'birth', 'home', 'midwife', 'Samantha', 'Ferris', 'Supernatural', 'who', 'fringes.Then', 'eighth', 'month', 'terrible', 'accident', 'occurs', 'life', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'baby', 'dead', 'determined', 'carry', 'term', 'when', 'baby', 'Grace', 'able', 'practically', 'will', 'live', 'price', 'keeping', 'baby', 'alive', 'icky', 'one.I', ""'ve"", 'deliberately', 'left', 'most', 'details', 'description', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'movie', 'horrific', 'unpleasant', 'breast-feeding', 'fair', 'amounts', 'blood', 'used', 'ways', 'could', 'make', 'one', 'queasy', 'lots', 'other', 'twists', 'theme', 'maternal', 'instincts', 'gone', 'terribly', 'askew', 'Not', 'only', 'Madeline', 'suffer', 'indulge', 'depending', 'one', 'point', 'view', 'mother-in-law', 'have', 'urges', 'take', 'normally', 'pure', 'lovely', 'instincts', 'something', 'ugly.Viewing', 'GRACE', 'not', 'exactly', 'pleasant', 'experience', 'were', 'describe', 'details', 'events', 'might', 'actually', 'sound', 'deeply', 'silly', 'film', 'have', 'tentative', 'dose', 'black', 'humor', 'just', 'something', 'so', 'uncomfortable', 'watching', 'much', 'have', 'say', 'might', 'be', 'worth', 'watching', ""'re"", 'mood', 'have', 'feelings', 'bonds', 'mother', 'infant', 'turned', 'horror', 'show']",N/A
1267004,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B002FUI4U6,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 3]","Grace (Paul Solet, 2009)I'll admit to some bias right up front; I picked up Grace because I'd heard that it was the world's first vegan horror film. The idea just didn't compute in my head, so when it showed up on Amazon Vine, I jumped at the chance. I wasn't really expecting much from it, especially after I found out the director had adapted it to feature-length from his own original short, but a surprisingly high-caliber cast and some really perverse grace notes (if you'll pardon the pun) make this into a film that, while not a classic, is a watchable, disturbing treat.Madeline Matheson (Cabin Fever's Jordan Ladd) has been having a lot of trouble getting pregnant. When she finally does, both she and her mousy husband Michael (Slither's Stephen Park) are overjoyed. Not so much Madeline's in-laws, Vivian (In the Name of the King's Gabrielle Rose) and Henry (The Day the Earth Stood Still's Serge Houde), who are concerned that Madeline's hippie-like ways will make her an unfit mother. After a car accident, Madeline loses the baby, but decides to carry it to term anyway; upon delivery, her midwife Pamela (Butterfly on a Wheel's Samantha Ferris) leaves her alone with the baby for a few minutes. When Pamela returns, however, she is shocked to discover that the child is actually alive. It has some odd dietary restrictions, though. And what's a committed vegan to do when her baby has a taste for blood?While the actual plot has more than its share of fascination value, Solet, who also wrote the screenplay, took the Fruit Chan method of stretching out shorts to feature length (Chan was responsible for the wonderful 2003 short, and 2004 film, Dumplings) and made his supporting characters even weirder. It worked for Chan, and it works for Solet. There are all kinds of nastinesses hinted at here, from Vivian's mother fixation (and how it affects her life with her husband) to the past relationship between Madeline and Pamela, which is somewhat murkier than Madeline's ""old friend"" description of her would have her husband believe. But what really sends the film into overdrive is the fact that Solet refuses, unequivocally, to blunt the real human emotions, or our reaction to the way they affect the characters on the screen. (He also plays on our inherent body horror in far more intimate ways than most horror directors, though I can't go into that without major spoilers. But my god, that last shot.) As an example, the opening scene; Madeline and Michael are having sex, and the look on Madeline's face is about what it would be were she watching paint dry. Solet puts it into context at the end of the scene (where we first learn about her problems conceiving), and you may be able to write it off as an aberration temporarily, but that same kind of emotional disjunct rears its ugly head again and again in the movie. Sure, you could put it down to ineptness on the parts of both director and actors if you weren't paying attention (and judging by a few reviews I've read so far, that's the case with some folks who watched it), but it's far too consistent, and at times far too subtle, for that to be right; Solet obviously meant us to feel that, and the very fact that he wanted to disturb us on that level tells me very good things about this guy. Yeah, sure, you've got a kid who drinks human blood, and how messed up is that?, but Solet isn't going to let that carry the entire film. Nope, not by a longshot, and that's what made Grace so much better a movie than I expected it to be. And I didn't even touch on the black, black comedy to be found here. I haven't felt this guilty chuckling at a movie since Very Bad Things.Definitely worth a rental. In fact, if you like your horror movies slow-paced, atmospheric, and deadpan, you owe it to yourself to check this one out. *** ",3,(Un)pleasant surprise.,1254268800,"09 30, 2009",2009,3813,"['Grace', 'Paul', 'Solet', '2009', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'bias', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'picked', 'up', 'Grace', ""'d"", 'heard', 'was', 'world', 'first', 'vegan', 'horror', 'film', 'idea', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'compute', 'head', 'so', 'when', 'showed', 'up', 'Amazon', 'Vine', 'jumped', 'chance', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'expecting', 'much', 'especially', 'found', 'out', 'director', 'had', 'adapted', 'feature-length', 'own', 'original', 'short', 'surprisingly', 'high-caliber', 'cast', 'really', 'perverse', 'grace', 'notes', ""'ll"", 'pardon', 'pun', 'make', 'film', 'not', 'classic', 'watchable', 'disturbing', 'treat.Madeline', 'Matheson', 'Cabin', 'Fever', 'Jordan', 'Ladd', 'been', 'having', 'lot', 'trouble', 'getting', 'pregnant', 'When', 'finally', 'mousy', 'husband', 'Michael', 'Slither', 'Stephen', 'Park', 'are', 'overjoyed', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'Madeline', 'in-laws', 'Vivian', 'Name', 'King', 'Gabrielle', 'Rose', 'Henry', 'Day', 'Earth', 'Stood', 'Still', 'Serge', 'Houde', 'who', 'are', 'concerned', 'Madeline', 'hippie-like', 'ways', 'will', 'make', 'unfit', 'mother', 'car', 'accident', 'Madeline', 'baby', 'carry', 'term', 'anyway', 'delivery', 'midwife', 'Pamela', 'Butterfly', 'Wheel', 'Samantha', 'Ferris', 'alone', 'baby', 'few', 'minutes', 'When', 'Pamela', 'returns', 'however', 'shocked', 'discover', 'child', 'actually', 'alive', 'odd', 'dietary', 'restrictions', 'though', 'what', 'committed', 'vegan', 'do', 'when', 'baby', 'taste', 'blood', 'actual', 'plot', 'more', 'share', 'fascination', 'value', 'Solet', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'took', 'Fruit', 'Chan', 'method', 'stretching', 'out', 'shorts', 'feature', 'length', 'Chan', 'was', 'responsible', 'wonderful', '2003', 'short', '2004', 'film', 'Dumplings', 'made', 'supporting', 'characters', 'even', 'weirder', 'worked', 'Chan', 'Solet', 'are', 'kinds', 'nastinesses', 'hinted', 'here', 'Vivian', 'mother', 'fixation', 'how', 'life', 'husband', 'past', 'relationship', 'Madeline', 'Pamela', 'somewhat', 'murkier', 'Madeline', 'old', 'friend', 'description', 'would', 'have', 'husband', 'believe', 'what', 'really', 'film', 'overdrive', 'fact', 'Solet', 'unequivocally', 'blunt', 'real', 'human', 'emotions', 'reaction', 'way', 'affect', 'characters', 'screen', 'also', 'inherent', 'body', 'horror', 'far', 'more', 'intimate', 'ways', 'most', 'horror', 'directors', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'major', 'spoilers', 'god', 'last', 'shot', 'example', 'opening', 'scene', 'Madeline', 'Michael', 'are', 'having', 'sex', 'look', 'Madeline', 'face', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'were', 'watching', 'paint', 'dry', 'Solet', 'context', 'end', 'scene', 'where', 'first', 'learn', 'problems', 'conceiving', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'write', 'off', 'aberration', 'temporarily', 'same', 'kind', 'emotional', 'disjunct', 'ugly', 'head', 'again', 'again', 'movie', 'Sure', 'could', 'put', 'down', 'ineptness', 'parts', 'director', 'actors', 'were', ""n't"", 'paying', 'attention', 'judging', 'few', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'so', 'far', 'case', 'folks', 'who', 'watched', 'far', 'too', 'consistent', 'times', 'far', 'too', 'subtle', 'be', 'right', 'Solet', 'obviously', 'meant', 'feel', 'very', 'fact', 'wanted', 'disturb', 'level', 'very', 'good', 'things', 'guy', 'Yeah', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'got', 'kid', 'who', 'human', 'blood', 'how', 'messed', 'up', 'Solet', ""n't"", 'going', 'let', 'carry', 'entire', 'film', 'Nope', 'not', 'longshot', 'what', 'made', 'Grace', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'expected', 'be', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'touch', 'black', 'black', 'comedy', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'have', ""n't"", 'felt', 'guilty', 'chuckling', 'movie', 'Very', 'Bad', 'Things.Definitely', 'rental', 'fact', 'like', 'horror', 'movies', 'slow-paced', 'atmospheric', 'deadpan', 'owe', 'yourself', 'check', 'one', 'out', '***']",N/A

Overall, I was impressed with everything they had to offer on this, and even if you find yourself in that group of people questioning the writing, the Blu has plenty to satiate even the discerning viewer.The story follows a mom and her stillborn/reanimated baby as they discover what it will take for them to survive. And without delving into being an actual horror/zombie baby film, they manage to show a low key, melodramatic (and as real as possible) take on this family's tale. There is little back story, and nothing given as to how this might have happened or why certain characters are involved to the level they are, so if vague plot lines bother you, skip it. Most of the complaints out there follow the lack of what I described, but in the end, and as sick as the last scene is, this still left with me the feel of seeing a competent and twisted film. Now the good stuff.The picture quality looks decent, but the grain shows through more often than not with the volume of indoor night shots. The sound is a mixed bag depending on which you select. There is a choice of 5.1 DD or PCM Uncompressed. I chose the latter after testing 12 different scenes containing the fly buzzing sounds and outright channel saturation (the airbag deployment for instance), and without hesitation, I say watch this in the PCM - louder, better and more articulate. The special features rock and include:* Grace at Sundance - 13 minutes. Includes some behind the scenes of what it is like to get into the famed festival, and everything one might encounter in getting your film accepted/marketed while there. The defining moment for me was seeing the director's mom have to comment on stage about the film - and she answered very politically correct for having just seen a demented film.* Grace Conception - 6:46 minutes. The short film history behind this title.* Grace Delivered - 37 minutes. The main making-of, logistics, interviews and everything one needs to know in what it took to make this. I actually liked this piece as it stays away from the fluffy interviews I hate and delved deep into the heart behind this.* Grace Family - 12 minutes. Description of the family dynamic behind these characters, helps answer some of the questions one might have about why certain things occur in the film.* Her Mother's Eyes, Look of Grace - 7 minutes. A thorough take on the production design and visuals.* Lullaby Scoring Grace - 9 minutes. Catered to those that love low key haunting score backgrounds, with plenty on the work that went into how long this took to make.

1267011,A3DV7AKNM4N8TN,B002FUI4U6,Stuart Conover,"[0, 0]","Written and directed by Paul Solet, Grace was a sleeper hit in some circles for 2009. It's a unique take on a horror movie and one of the few that are done more while observing what would classically be thought of as something that mainly women would go through. In this case it is overly exemplified with the fact that the main character apparently loses both her husband and child in a car accident and has to go through the entire ordeal of the movie alone.When it gets right down to it Grace can be a very slow movie. In all actuality not a 'lot' happens directly on screen and there are long moments where the movie's scenes aren't tense. I feel though that a lot of these moments would be required with how the film itself plays out though they would be hard to handle for quite a few viewers.We start the film with Madeline Matherson (Jordan Ladd) and her husband (Stephen Park) clearly expecting another shot at having a child after two miscarriages and who's third try appears to be working out for her with no issues. This peace is quickly put to rest as a car accident robs her of her husband and leaves the child inside her dead.With all of this loss it's easy to understand why Madeline may choose this time in her life to slightly lose it. How about by still finishing off the last of her pregnancy and giving birth to a child she knows will be stillborn? Realistically I'm sure every doctor would be enthusiastic about letting this occur. I'm sure there are no health concerns in the slightest that would cause a doctor to prevent this from happening at all. Ignoring this fact (it is a movie) we see that when the baby is born, against the fact she's been dead for nearly a month, Grace still cries when she comes out of her mother's womb.Yes, the child is in fact alive and apparently perfectly healthy - assuming of course that a craving for blood instead of milk makes you healthy at less than a year old. Now would probably be a great place to insert that while we find out she needs blood to live purely by accident on the mother's side that Madeline is also a strict vegetarian and the thought of eating meat is very against her belief system.Honestly aside from the slow pacing of parts of the movie there are generally quite a few positive surprises that are found within. It deals a lot with human nature and showing what people are willing to do for whom and what they love. It also has top notch acting and aside from a baby that requires blood to survive and a doctor willing to let her bring it out naturally when it was apparently already dead the entire movie has a completely realistic feel to it. People show off emotions how you would expect them to and the characters are fully believable. It has quite a few overly creepy moments and an ending that has one of the more disturbing scenes that I have seen as of late.",4,Now... that's a creepy baby..,1301875200,"04 4, 2011",2011,2851,"['Written', 'directed', 'Paul', 'Solet', 'Grace', 'was', 'sleeper', 'hit', 'circles', '2009', 'unique', 'take', 'horror', 'movie', 'one', 'few', 'are', 'done', 'more', 'observing', 'what', 'would', 'classically', 'be', 'thought', 'something', 'mainly', 'women', 'would', 'go', 'case', 'overly', 'exemplified', 'fact', 'main', 'character', 'apparently', 'husband', 'child', 'car', 'accident', 'go', 'entire', 'ordeal', 'movie', 'right', 'down', 'Grace', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'slow', 'movie', 'actuality', 'not', ""'lot"", 'happens', 'directly', 'screen', 'are', 'long', 'moments', 'where', 'movie', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'tense', 'feel', 'lot', 'moments', 'would', 'be', 'required', 'how', 'film', 'out', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'handle', 'quite', 'few', 'viewers.We', 'start', 'film', 'Madeline', 'Matherson', 'Jordan', 'Ladd', 'husband', 'Stephen', 'Park', 'clearly', 'expecting', 'shot', 'having', 'child', 'two', 'miscarriages', 'who', 'third', 'try', 'be', 'working', 'out', 'issues', 'peace', 'quickly', 'put', 'rest', 'car', 'accident', 'robs', 'husband', 'child', 'dead.With', 'loss', 'easy', 'understand', 'why', 'Madeline', 'may', 'choose', 'time', 'life', 'slightly', 'lose', 'How', 'still', 'finishing', 'off', 'last', 'pregnancy', 'giving', 'birth', 'child', 'will', 'be', 'stillborn', 'Realistically', ""'m"", 'sure', 'doctor', 'would', 'be', 'enthusiastic', 'letting', 'occur', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'health', 'concerns', 'slightest', 'would', 'cause', 'doctor', 'prevent', 'happening', 'Ignoring', 'fact', 'movie', 'see', 'when', 'baby', 'born', 'fact', 'been', 'dead', 'nearly', 'month', 'Grace', 'still', 'when', 'mother', 'womb.Yes', 'child', 'fact', 'alive', 'apparently', 'perfectly', 'healthy', 'assuming', 'course', 'craving', 'blood', 'instead', 'milk', 'healthy', 'less', 'year', 'old', 'Now', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'great', 'place', 'insert', 'find', 'out', 'blood', 'live', 'purely', 'accident', 'mother', 'side', 'Madeline', 'also', 'strict', 'vegetarian', 'thought', 'eating', 'meat', 'very', 'belief', 'system.Honestly', 'aside', 'slow', 'pacing', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'generally', 'quite', 'few', 'positive', 'surprises', 'are', 'found', 'lot', 'human', 'nature', 'showing', 'what', 'people', 'are', 'willing', 'do', 'whom', 'what', 'love', 'also', 'top', 'notch', 'acting', 'aside', 'baby', 'blood', 'survive', 'doctor', 'willing', 'let', 'bring', 'out', 'naturally', 'when', 'was', 'apparently', 'already', 'dead', 'entire', 'movie', 'completely', 'realistic', 'feel', 'People', 'show', 'off', 'emotions', 'how', 'would', 'expect', 'characters', 'are', 'fully', 'believable', 'quite', 'few', 'overly', 'creepy', 'moments', 'ending', 'one', 'more', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'have', 'seen', 'late']",N/A

1267013,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B002FUI4U6,Terry Mesnard,"[4, 7]","Madeline understands pain and regret.  She and her rather spineless husband have, as Grace opens, tried multiple times to have a child and the two times she ended up pregnant, she miscarried.  So when, as the film begins, Madeline ends up being pregnant a third time, the fear that this one will also end in sadness is understandable.  As the beginning minutes of this very brisk film (84 minutes) roll out, we're introduced to Madeline's in-laws, her former friend and now holistic midwife Patricia and the ""evil doctors"" at the heart of this story.  Then, the unthinkable happens, causing Madeline to miscarry again...but for some reason, this time she gets the idea in her head to carry the now dead baby to term.  Upon giving birth, the baby ends up coming alive...or does it?Grace tries to ape the stylings of the traditional mother-in-peril films like Rosemary's Baby (or more recently, The Devil's Advocate) and the like.  The audience realizes, even though no one else apparently does, that baby Grace ain't right.  Flies are attracted to it, it loves the taste of blood and it has an odd shade of color (which could, honestly, be because a very unrealistic plastic doll is used for the majority of the shots).  And yet, the obsessive mother doesn't notice any of this and thinks it's perfectly natural (""Grace has special needs,"" she screams once) to have destroyed breasts from the simple act of breast feeding.In some ways, the real story in Grace is one of obsession.  It seems that every single character in this film is obsessed in some way or another, whether it's Madeline's obsession with having a baby, even a dead one; or, her husband's bizarre Oedipal obsession with his mother; or her mother-in-law's very strange obsession with still wanting to create breast milk; or her old friend's obsession with Madeline.  Unfortunately, this is also not a movie about obsession because none of these underlying neuroses are even remotely explored, other than in a very cursory way, for shock value.Compounding the problems, Grace seemingly glazes over plot details, willing its viewer to just go along with the story for the sake of the story.  No meaningful characters are created.  It's simply broad strokes: crazy, hippy mommy, WASPish but also insane mother-in-law, ""evil doctors"" who want to take her baby away and other assorted crazies.  It's obvious that writer/director Paul Solet was trying to make an indie art horror film, with the slow-motion sequences, off-kilter shots (to signify the growing insanity), interspersed clips of animals being mutilated, killed or feeding their young.  However, it's not anywhere close to being memorable or interesting, partially because the screenplay is a mess.  You might wonder, why is he talking about meanings and themes for a horror movie?!  Well, I need something to talk about because Grace isn't even scary in the slightest.  So, if it' too unrealistic to be disturbing, too silly to be taken seriously and too empty and vapidly written to be an art film, what is it...besides a waste of your time?",2,The one where things happen for no particular reason,1253750400,"09 24, 2009",2009,3065,"['Madeline', 'pain', 'regret', 'rather', 'spineless', 'husband', 'have', 'Grace', 'tried', 'multiple', 'times', 'have', 'child', 'two', 'times', 'ended', 'up', 'pregnant', 'miscarried', 'So', 'when', 'film', 'Madeline', 'up', 'being', 'pregnant', 'third', 'time', 'fear', 'one', 'will', 'also', 'end', 'sadness', 'understandable', 'beginning', 'minutes', 'very', 'brisk', 'film', '84', 'minutes', 'roll', 'out', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'Madeline', 'in-laws', 'former', 'friend', 'now', 'holistic', 'midwife', 'Patricia', 'evil', 'doctors', 'heart', 'story', 'Then', 'unthinkable', 'happens', 'causing', 'Madeline', 'miscarry', 'again', 'reason', 'time', 'idea', 'head', 'carry', 'now', 'dead', 'baby', 'term', 'giving', 'birth', 'baby', 'up', 'coming', 'alive', 'Grace', 'ape', 'stylings', 'traditional', 'mother-in-peril', 'films', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'more', 'recently', 'Devil', 'Advocate', 'like', 'audience', 'realizes', 'even', 'one', 'else', 'apparently', 'baby', 'Grace', 'ai', ""n't"", 'right', 'Flies', 'are', 'attracted', 'taste', 'blood', 'odd', 'shade', 'color', 'could', 'honestly', 'be', 'very', 'unrealistic', 'plastic', 'doll', 'used', 'majority', 'shots', 'yet', 'obsessive', 'mother', ""n't"", 'notice', 'perfectly', 'natural', 'Grace', 'special', 'needs', 'once', 'have', 'destroyed', 'breasts', 'simple', 'act', 'breast', 'feeding.In', 'ways', 'real', 'story', 'Grace', 'one', 'obsession', 'single', 'character', 'film', 'obsessed', 'way', 'Madeline', 'obsession', 'having', 'baby', 'even', 'dead', 'one', 'husband', 'bizarre', 'Oedipal', 'obsession', 'mother', 'mother-in-law', 'very', 'strange', 'obsession', 'still', 'wanting', 'create', 'breast', 'milk', 'old', 'friend', 'obsession', 'Madeline', 'Unfortunately', 'also', 'not', 'movie', 'obsession', 'none', 'underlying', 'neuroses', 'are', 'even', 'remotely', 'explored', 'other', 'very', 'cursory', 'way', 'shock', 'value.Compounding', 'problems', 'Grace', 'seemingly', 'over', 'plot', 'details', 'willing', 'viewer', 'just', 'go', 'along', 'story', 'sake', 'story', 'meaningful', 'characters', 'are', 'created', 'simply', 'broad', 'strokes', 'crazy', 'hippy', 'mommy', 'WASPish', 'also', 'insane', 'mother-in-law', 'evil', 'doctors', 'who', 'want', 'take', 'baby', 'away', 'other', 'assorted', 'crazies', 'obvious', 'writer/director', 'Paul', 'Solet', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'indie', 'art', 'horror', 'film', 'slow-motion', 'sequences', 'off-kilter', 'shots', 'signify', 'growing', 'insanity', 'interspersed', 'clips', 'animals', 'being', 'mutilated', 'killed', 'feeding', 'young', 'However', 'not', 'anywhere', 'close', 'being', 'memorable', 'interesting', 'partially', 'screenplay', 'mess', 'might', 'wonder', 'why', 'talking', 'meanings', 'themes', 'horror', 'movie', 'Well', 'need', 'something', 'talk', 'because', 'Grace', ""n't"", 'even', 'scary', 'slightest', 'So', 'too', 'unrealistic', 'be', 'disturbing', 'too', 'silly', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'too', 'empty', 'vapidly', 'written', 'be', 'art', 'film', 'what', 'waste', 'time']",N/A

The mother succeeds in getting pregnant but, against her mother-in-law's advice, shuns traditional medical care for care by a midwife instead.  When she comes near term a sudden accident results in the death of the fetus in utero.  She elects to carry the fetus to term and then, with her midwife's assistance, delivers her dead infant.  Inexplicably, the new infant is brought back to life.  But as time goes on it becomes quite obvious there is something very wrong with the baby.  The remainder of the film then focuses on mom's efforts to provide for her baby's unnatural needs while her mother-in-law works behind the scenes to obtain custody of the infant.This movie is listed as a horror film, but it is not like most typical horror films.  There are some underlying tensions -- vegan vs. meat-eating lifestyles, traditional obstetric care vs. midwifery, and homosexuality -- that add to the complexity of the plot.  But there are no real shocking surprises in this movie, and most everything that occurs is quite predictable.  There is minimal violence involved, but there are scenes that are rather disgusting and gross.  What little horror there is lies more in the mother's progressive madness as she tries to cope with her baby's needs.Those seeking a movie that is scary or frightening will be disappointed with this film.

The plot of the film is pretty grim itself, and the mother-child scenes appear almost to be scenes we never saw in ""Rosemary's Baby.""  A little bit about the plot:  Madeline Matheson, eight months pregnant,  is in an accident that causes the death of the baby within her.  She is determined to carry the dead baby to term, but when she delivers her stillborn child, her deep love brings the baby back to life.  She names the child Grace.  It soon becomes apparent that Grace is no ordinary infant:  she  smells terrible all the time, attracts flies, and breast feeds on blood rather than milk.  The strong thematic thread to the tale is a mother's deep devotion to her child,  something we've seen before in such films as ""The Good Son,""  ""The Omen,"" and especially ""Rosemary's Baby.""  The film moves slowly at first, but does pack a visual wallop with plenty of blood.  Jordan Ladd does an above-average job as the distraught mother and the script allows her to be far more than a horror flick cliche.  ""Grace"" is a modest horror films that gets under the skin and creates that essential horror ingredient -- uneasiness.  There are a large number of bonus extras  that focus on the film's planning, filming, characterization, and its audience reaction at the Sundance Film Festival.

1267016,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B002FUI4U6,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[2, 2]","Doesn't the following sound like a great idea for a horror movie; a pregnant woman with three weeks left in her pregnancy is in an auto accident.  This auto accident produces a tragic outcome, her baby is killed.  The mother is obviously devastated, but decides to carry out the rest of her pregnancy and give natural birth; despite the fact the mother (to be) knows the child will be stillborn.  However, when the child is born, she is alive and appears rather ghoulish.I felt like this was going to be a great little horror flick. However, when the end credits rolled I was very disenchanted.  This movie had an original premise and sadly didn't deliver the goods. This is really odd because this movie has received a lot of praise.As for the plot, Madeline is pregnant for the third time.  Her first two pregnancies resulted in miscarriages.  She and her husband Michael seem very pleased about the new addition to the family.  Nevertheless, Madeline's mother-in-law is always questions Madeline about how she plans to raise her child.Madeline and Michael are using a midwife instead of working directly with a medical doctor.  Digressing, this is one of the issues that drives the mother-in-law crazy.  Apparently, the midwife Patricia and Madeline use to be intimately involved at one point in time.  Why this is important to the plot is never really explained, the two characters had zero chemistry.Then one night Michael and Madeline are in an auto accident.  Michael is killed and Madeline loses the baby, or so we think.  Another thing I found sort of strange is Madeline never once really seems upset that her husband died. Once the child is born and ""comes to life"" via breast feeding, she is named Grace.Well Grace is one creepy baby.  She has a taste for blood.  So needless to say she gets a little rough when Madeline breast feeds her.  So this leads Madeline to par take in some undesirable behaviors in order to feed her little one.  Beyond this ""pony show: there really isn't much more to this movie.  The film is only 80 minutes long and feels much longer.  It takes a very long time for anything to happen and when it finally does it's anticlimactic.Another thing that was sort of troublesome with this movie was the baby.  There were scenes that a real baby was used and then for no reason a rubber baby was use.  I understand that an infant cannot be subjected to make up and special effects, that is neglect and/or abuse.  However, when an actress is holding a real baby and she turns and is now holding a rubber baby it really adulterates the integrity of the film.  There were also all these flies in the movie.  I guess since the baby was a pseudo zombie they wanted to give Grace some company.  As for the actress playing Madeline, she had a lot of lone screen time.

I hate it when it becomes about that, too, and I think I'm venting a little because a few high-profile reviews outside of Amazon were built on this heading. I don't know when things got this way and started building on the extra bus but I do know this: If I buy something like a movie it is about a movie I want to watch and my hopes that depend on the genre expectation. With this flick, I have to say that I was not expecting a lot because it is a movie with a little bottle on it and a description that made me think it was either a B-movie that could make me laugh or a surprise that could make me happy. a lot of early reviews made me think it was going to be the surprise part, too, because they had quite a few things to say on the good side of the movie. Then i watched the thing, saw it was jammed with extras, and wondered if that was why it scored so highly. I know it wasn't the movie - it was funny here and cheap there, and it was likeable if you want that - because I thought it would be better.Well, maybe I didn't think it would be better but I did have some hopes.There are a lot of reviews that tear the movie down into little slices, so you can pan for those if you need that. I just want to say that, given my choices of movies, this was not high on my list of memories. I did like it: I had time to burn, laughed a few times, and had some friends that said, ""that was descent."" Read about the movie and imagine why it could be that word, descent, and you probably hit the nail on the head. If you need a baby horror, look up some Japanese thrillers or some Korean horror and you can find yourself going past campy and getting into horrifically weird.

1267021,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B002FUI4U6,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[1, 3]","I've been real disappointed with American horror the last few years. Most of them have cheapened their style in utilizing elaborate special effects, a weak storyline, remakes and beautiful people. I wasn't expecting much with writer/director Paul Solet's ""Grace"", and surprisingly, it proved to be an overpowering horror film. It would be easy to dismiss the film as another ""It's Alive"" rip off or just another attempt at vampire horror. The film utilizes the fine art of cerebral intrusion, it doesn't follow the standard rules of the horror genre and instead turns the ugly head of something that is supposed to be an amazing experience; a mother nursing her own baby. ""Grace"" has all the makings of a successful low-budget horror film; it is twisted, shocking and maddening...the film just feels wrong.Madeline and Michael (Jordan Ladd and Stephen Park respectively) is a young couple who is very adamant on having a child and have finally gotten 8 months pregnant again. They have suffered through 2 miscarriages and out of desperation, they opt to seek the services of a midwife clinic headed by Patricia Lang (Samantha Ferris). One evening, a car accident takes the life of Madeline's husband and her baby had been determined also dead. Madeline decides to carry the baby nonetheless, and to pretend that the baby is still born. When she does give birth, her baby is lifeless but miraculously, the baby comes to life; Madeline considers the event as divine intervention and names her child Grace. However, the problems begin when she takes her baby home as strange things begin to happen and Madeline finds that her baby requires not mother's milk but fresh human blood. Madeline is still determined to see things through, even at the possible cause of her very life.I am quite surprised that I haven't heard of Paul Solet. He has displayed intelligence, a great methodical approach and finesse in the making of this horror movie. I thought I was about to see a baby on a bloodlust much like ""It's Alive"", the Filipino horror movie ""Tianak"" or the Japanese horror movie ""Tamami: The Baby's Curse"" but surprisingly the plot of this film while very simple manages to find the right tone, style to pull off this very disturbing horror film. Solet's direction sidesteps the mechanics of standard horror filmmaking; in ""Grace"", there is no threat to be eliminated or vanquished. This film is more about the psychological state of a mother and her twisted desire to keep her child alive.Solet manages to display quite a few freaky images. The sight of a mother feeding her baby should be beautiful and amazing, it is just so downright unsettling to see it seem so ominous and creepy. It is just so wrong to see a baby rejecting her own mother's milk and starts feeding off her life giving blood. Which as a result drives her to extreme anemia. Jordan Ladd gives an excellent performance as Madeline (this film may prove to be her best performance), and in this film one has to take into account that this mother had suffered through two miscarriages and her state of mind has to be brought into question/consideration. The film isn't about jump scares, scary images and special effects but more on visual cerebral images that can make the viewer very uncomfortable.I've mentioned that there is no threat to be eliminated and no one gets killed by this inhuman baby. The baby itself is innocent, it is the situation that serves as the main antagonist. Madeline's child is as innocent, cute and adorable as your usual baby; she is as helpless as a babe, incapable of defending herself or harming anyone. Grace the baby is just doing what every other baby does when she's hungry; she feeds. There is no malevolence or unkindness to what she does, it is no fault of her own that her situation is both a phenomenon and a curse. I think parts of the mythos of the film can be attributed to the myths of the ""shell"". A myth where a soulless shell (or body) left out in the open can attract several spirits, even demonic ones. Warning signs signify this myth through the flies that hover above the crib, sensitivity to water and the infant's bad odor.Madeline wholeheartedly subjects herself to the immensity of the situation, as she would do anything to protect and sustain the life of her child. She never intentionally kills anyone to feed her child, whoever she attacks holds malice towards her and her baby; it is a twisted idea of self defense. The film's driving force comes NOT from hatred or trepidation...love or the twisted understanding of it is the one thing that drives the horror of this film. Mothers are naturally protective of their children. Again, it is imperative to consider the mother's feelings to appreciate this horror movie.I also have to commend the efforts that Solet made to restrain from the usual clich&eacute;s. Solet respects his audience and presents a methodical horror film without good and evil; he appreciates the fact that for a horror movie to be truly effective, his audience has to have an investment in his characters. ""Grace"" is a horrifying character study in the way the script is structured. Solet magnificently avoids jump scares, teenage stereotypes and caricature-like characters. The direction gives the main characters time to settle in to his audience as we see their state of mind even as the two make love in the opening act. Madeline raises her knees to insure pregnancy, the scenes speak a lot for their characters. Solet firmly believes that a picture is worth a thousand words. Even the character of Vivian, Madeline's mother-in-law (played by Gabrielle Rose) who came dangerously close to becoming clich&eacute;; Solet manages to give her some needed depth. After her son's lost, she just becomes obsessed in playing the role of a mother that is given credibility when she checks her own 'milk situation'. This is a film about mothers and the pain about losing an offspring. Solet brings every point across through the sleek photography and simple execution.Jordan Ladd carries the burden of the film and she delivers. ""Grace"" is also a film about isolation and alienation; Ladd spends most of the screenplay by herself. Her baby may be the film's driving force, but its emotional and narrative impact is carried by Ladd by herself. Her role is no walk in the park, and Ladd delivers. She performs astonishingly well as a mother under a lot of mental torture. She keeps her character grounded, and keeps her ""Madeline"" from becoming over-the-top. For a character at her lowest ebb, it is tempting to deliver the scenes with just false bravado. The scene with Madeline standing over the crib as the sun rises is just breathtaking. This film has made me a fan of Jordan Ladd.I do hope that this isn't his last horror film, American horror needs more writers and directors like Paul Solet. The finesse, the craftsmanship just contributes to the every aspect of the film's tone and plot. One minor flaw that I can find is that the hints of the lesbian subplot may feel a little out of place and there is an underlying plot hole as to the baby's condition before she was brought home. The climax may also be missing a few details but I can easily look pass that. ""Grace"" is right in the brink of exceptional filmmaking. ""Grace"" is just primal, visceral, disturbing, an amazingly well-made horror film that generates its terror from emotions. Fans of fast-paced jumps and thrills may be disappointed since the film is a little slow in the first half.""Grace"" is artistically rendered and utterly unnerving. There is just something unsettling about a movie that depicts the horror of childbirth and ""Grace"" draws its strength from that. This may not be essential to horror fanatics but it is a refreshing reminder just how awesome and compelling horror films can become.Highly Recommended!!
