Marcie puts salt on the egg and then crunches down on the shell and says ""Tastes terrible Sir.""

350782,A11YV6VC51HJTV,6303014887,"Blake Petit ""Novelist, columnist & reviewer""","[12, 17]","As much as I love Peanuts, I have to say, the &#65533;Easter Beagle&#65533; cartoon wasn&#65533;t one of the strongest ones. While Peppermint Patty is frustrated with trying to teach the conventions of the holiday to Marcie, Linus insists that the Easter Beagle will save the day. The story feels like a hodgepodge of elements form other &#65533;Peanuts&#65533; cartoons -- Linus&#65533;s confusion about holiday icons smacks of &#65533;It&#65533;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown&#65533; (the twist being that this time, he&#65533;s right), while Patty and Marcie&#65533;s kitchen mishaps remind me of the fiasco in &#65533;A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving.&#65533;It&#65533;s still &#65533;Peanuts,&#65533; so it&#65533;s still warm and funny, but it&#65533;s not one of the best.Oddly enough the back-up cartoon on this DVD IS one of the best. &#65533;It&#65533;s Arbor Day, Charlie Brown&#65533; starts out with a explanation of one of the most superfluous holidays imaginable and turns into a hysterical, well-written and wonderfully entertaining story about Charlie Brown&#65533;s frequent baseball tribulations. His own team seems out to sabotage him this time, turning his baseball diamond into a garden, right down to the tree in the middle of his pitcher&#65533;s mound.

In this story, the Peanuts gang is preparing for Easter.  Just like in the Great Pumpkin, Linus is again trying to convince his friends that they don't need to worry about preparing for the holiday...this time the Easter Beagle will be bringing all the boys and girls candy and Easter eggs.Peppermint Patty is trying to teach Marcie all about dying Easter eggs.  Each time they buy another dozen eggs, Marcie manages to misunderstand Patty's directions and ends up frying, waffling, and baking them and even cracking them open into a pot of boiling water, thereby making egg soup.  They are all out of eggs and money, so they now have no Easter eggs.Charlie Brown takes his little sister Sally to the department store to buy some new Easter shoes.  There are really cute scenes as Sally, Snoopy, and Woodstock have fun trying out music boxes and hats.  What is pretty humorous is that even back in 1974 when this was made, they were poking fun at how early the stores begin selling Christmas decoration and gifts.  The store is all decked out for Christmas at Eastertime, and a giant banner says ""Only 246 Days Till Xmas...Buy Now/Buy Early.""Woodstock decides he needs a birdhouse, and he and Snoopy go shopping.  Then Woodstock remodels the simple birdhouse that Snoopy buys him and makes it into what looks like a 1970s bachelor pad complete with a sunken living room and spiral staircase.  Too funny!  I love seeing a few scenes in shows like this that basically date it to the time period it was produced.When Lucy dyes her own Easter eggs and hides them where only she will know where they are, Snoopy finds them and then saves Easter by donning a pair of bunny ears and skipping about distributing one to every child.

I wish some of the music was released on CD (I don't know why it wasn't on Charlie Brown's Holiday Hits). It's a classic perrenial show. Some have disliked the lack of religion, but I think Schroeder's quote, ""It's a time of renewal, a start of spring"" is sufficient.""It's Arbor Day, Charlie Brown"" is a foreshadowing of the poor quality that would come in the 1980s. It was made in 1976, one year after ""Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown"", but the voices aren't as good. The voices are the main problem here (although they're still better than the '80s), but they're not the only one. The backgrounds aren't as good, and the baseball field is more brown than usual, even with all the plants. Even Vince Guaraldi's music isn't quite as lively as usual.

If not it should because after the classic Christmas and Halloween Peanuts specials this one is the next based.  Made in 1974 it has every bit of the charm and laughs as those other specials and it's too bad that it doesn't get more notoriety.  They really do not make them like this anymore.This special is much like ""It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown"" in that we again have the ever hopeful Linus, trying to convince the rest of the gang that the Easter Beagle will arrive on Easter Morning to give eggs the kids.  None of the gang are buying it however and they are all off having their own problems.  Peppermint Patty is trying to teach Marcie to color eggs, much to Patty's frustration, Sally has to get some new shoes at the mall, Snoopy wants to get a new bird cage for Woodstock, and Charlie Brown is discouraged to see the stores already advertising for Christmas at Easter time.This DVD comes with a bonus Peanuts special, ""It's Arbor Day, Charlie Brown"".  I guess they were pretty much scraping the bottom of the barrel when they made this one in 1976.  It's not bad mind you, but who celebrates Arbor Day?  While researching a report on Arbor Day, Sally enlists the gang to turn Charlie Brown's ball field into a garden and orchard, complete with a tree on the pitcher's mound and scarecrow in the outfield.Good Peanuts fun!",5,VERY UNDERRATED PEANUTS SPECIAL,1110844800,"03 15, 2005",2005,1380,"['one', 'still', 'even', 'pop', 'up', 'TV', 'not', 'should', 'because', 'classic', 'Christmas', 'Halloween', 'Peanuts', 'one', 'next', 'based', 'Made', '1974', 'bit', 'charm', 'other', 'specials', 'too', 'bad', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'notoriety', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'anymore.This', 'special', 'much', 'Great', 'Pumpkin', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'again', 'have', 'ever', 'hopeful', 'Linus', 'trying', 'convince', 'rest', 'gang', 'Easter', 'Beagle', 'will', 'arrive', 'Easter', 'Morning', 'give', 'eggs', 'kids', 'None', 'gang', 'are', 'buying', 'however', 'are', 'having', 'own', 'problems', 'Peppermint', 'Patty', 'trying', 'teach', 'Marcie', 'color', 'eggs', 'much', 'Patty', 'frustration', 'Sally', 'get', 'new', 'shoes', 'mall', 'Snoopy', 'get', 'new', 'bird', 'cage', 'Woodstock', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'discouraged', 'see', 'stores', 'already', 'advertising', 'Christmas', 'Easter', 'time.This', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'Peanuts', 'special', 'Arbor', 'Day', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'guess', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'scraping', 'bottom', 'barrel', 'when', 'made', 'one', '1976', 'not', 'bad', 'mind', 'who', 'Arbor', 'Day', 'researching', 'report', 'Arbor', 'Day', 'Sally', 'gang', 'turn', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'ball', 'field', 'garden', 'orchard', 'complete', 'tree', 'pitcher', 'mound', 'scarecrow', 'outfield.Good', 'Peanuts', 'fun']",Peanuts: Easter Beagle Charlie Brown VHS

Linus' story reminds Sally of the Great Pumpkin just a little too much, but she wants to believe her Sweet Baboo.  Complete with a familiar, though this time subtle anti-consumerism message and an unintentional allegory about faith, IT'S THE EASTER BEAGLE, CHARLIE BROWN is a spring-time treat that families can enjoy watching together.This remastered deluxe version of IT'S THE EASTER BEAGLE, CHARLIE BROWN also includes a second television special, a special featurette, and a few trailers.  The second Peanuts episode on the disc is IT'S ARBOR DAY, CHARLIE BROWN.  Sally is given a school assignment to research Arbor Day.  Her quest leads her to wanting to plant trees, flowers, and a garden.  Lucy, Linus, and a few others join her and start growing a bunch of plants on Charlie Brown's baseball field.  Charlie Brown is shocked when the season opener against Peppermint Patty's team rolls around and he finds his field has been turned into a garden.  But, the game goes on and surprisingly Charlie Brown's gets a winning run and leads the game.The featurette on the DVD is ""In Full Bloom: Peanuts at Easter"" offers an inside look at the creation of IT'S THE EASTER BEAGLE, CHARLIE BROWN.
