As much as Disney has produced some authentic and honorable films before, they have also been known to follow popular cadence and create what would now be considered offensive and insulting material.  Instead of chipper little green men, or sparkling faeries and unicorns, Darby O'Gill and the Little People instead deals primarily with the simple small-town Irish life around the onset of the 20th century.  While King Brian and the Little People do play an integral role in the story, they are not the main focus, nor the primary source of confict.Enter instead Darby O'Gill (played brilliantly by Albert Sharpe), an aging caretaker of a large farm, who is deemed to be passing on in years.  The loveable antagonist (Sean Connery, in one of his first major roles that caught the eye of Albert R. Broccoli) arrives on the scene, but reluctantly so, for his soon falls for O'Gills daughter, Katie (Janet Munro, looking as charming and beautiful as ever).  Through it all, Darby and King Brian (Jimmy O'Dea, a fantastic character both on-screen and in real life) play their game of mental wits, which adds quite a bit of humor and playful Irish lore into the film.  Toss in a banshee and dullahan (some rather frightful spirits), and you have the makings of an all-around enticing story!There are some lovely scenes of Ireland in the film, though it was mostly shot in Burbank.  If I had to make a complaint, it would be just that: I could always stand to see more of the Emerald Isle on screen.  Still, the scene paintings are extraordinary and the set design is very authentic and convincing.  The special effects (for the time) are well-done and fairly seamless, as one would expect from a Disney film of any era.While some truly devoted Irish men and women might take some slight offense at the portayals in the film, for the most part, Darby O'Gill and the Little People is something of an ode to the Irish people.  Gone are the gaudy and constant smiling shamrocks and bright green clothes.  In are the Irish farmers, townspeople, d&eacute;cor, attire, and mannerisms.  This is a must-see film for St. Patrick's Day and definitely a safe family film for parents and kids alike.  (Due to some rather frightening ghost and fantasy scenes, you might consider screening this before showing to anyone under 5 or 6, but otherwise, it should be just perfect).

And not just for Disney; I had the impression that all involved were having the time of their lives.  And no wonder -- the film is a breath of Irish mountain air.

In fact, it is quite a bit more blarney, but nevermind. This is Disney at his most Disneyesque. In fact, included in the DVD is an episode of the Disney TV show, ""I Captured the King of the Leprechauns."" Disney does the entire show as if the leprechauns were real, and at he beginning of the movie, the credits include Thanks to King Brian and his Little People for their participation.There is one major bonus to this movie, however: a very young Sean Connery. Delicious! The rest of the cast is Irish people (well, so is Connery, for all that) who have not gotten famous. I seem to remember some of the faces from other movies or TV shows, or perhaps commercials. I'm pretty sure the young lady who is Connery's love interest was also in Irish Spring commercials.Anyway, Darby O'Gill is caretaker for the local lord, who is rarely in residence. But when he shows up this time, he brings Michael (Connery) as the new caretaker, and proposes to retire Darby on half pay. Problem is, he and his daughter Katie will have to move out of the gate house to a smaller cottage. Katie has lived there all her life (20 years), and so Darby is reluctant to tell her they must move.It becomes obvious that the solution is for Katie to marry Michael so they can all live in the gate house together. But it will take some doing to get them to see it. For one thing, she's been picked out as the future wife of her neighbor's son. The neighbor is an old crone (who looks familiar) whose son is a large, stupid braggart and bully. Katie doesn't like him.Darby goes up the mountain where the ancient ruined castle dominates the hilltop, lured by his horse Cleopatra who has been bewitched. Cleopatra turns into a pooka (see ""Harvey"" review, a couple of months back) and tricks Darby to fall down the well that leads to King Brian's domain. King Brian considers this a rescue, as he knows about him being retired and having to move from the gate house. But Darby plays the ""The Hunt"" on a fiddle (a Stradivarius, no less!) and gets them so worked up they go get their white ponies and ride out of the mountain to go hunting. They open a crack in the mountain to get out, and Darby gets out that way.Most of what this movie is about is the special effects involved in making leprechauns, a banshee, the pooka horse (basically solarized photos), and the Death Coach. There's not much of a story, except the battle of wits between Darby and King Brian, and that's pretty silly, really.It's fluff. If you want a movie to share with little children, this is it.

Many of the details just plain ridiculous to Irish Americans and Irish people alike and even the dialogue is spiked with phrases used by Brits, not the Irish. This is an Americanized view of Ireland strictly for people who think the Irish drink green beer on St. Paddy's Day and think everybody in Ireland walks around with a shamrock stuck in their lapel.  The music? Good Lord! Considering the wealth of real Irish music to draw from, the soundtrack is just an embarrasment.

This one has a retrospective by Sean Connery, a really well done explanation of two amazing special effects techniques, which are matte paintings and forced perspective, and a 50-minute Disney TV broadcast where Walt Disney pretends to meet the characters in Ireland.The movie itself takes a special mindset to watch.  By that, I mean that you have to lose yourself in the 1950s American stereotype of Ireland, which may have been established by The Quiet Man, the first Hollywood movie done in Ireland.  This movie has the same essential Irish components:  music, bar fighting, a feisty and charming girl, and an upstanding young man who wants to marry her.  It's interesting that Disney hired the same cinematographer who had done The Quiet Man, Winton Hoch.  Along with Peter Ellenshaw's matte work, Hoch's Technicolor cinematography makes the movie a visual treat.  The special effects are really fun to watch, too, most of all when the leprechauns leave their underground realm and Darby tries to follow them.Even though the artificiality of the Irish stereotypes took a little time for me to warm up to, it wasn't too long before I started enjoying the half-fantasy, half-realistic Irish world the movie creates.  (I hadn't seen this movie in years and didn't remember it well.)  The Irish actor who plays Darby O'Gill, an old fella who loves telling stories about meeting and trying to trick the leprechaun king, is really good.  This movie was also the necessary step in Sean Connery's career before he became James Bond, and he plays a really nice character who's ultra-patient with Darby as Darby keeps delaying the transition process.  Sean Connery is supposed to replace Darby as groundkeeper for the lord, and the lord wants Darby to be out of there and Connery in by 2 weeks.  Darby keeps delaying in even telling his daughter about it, and is in the process of trying to determine a wish to make to the leprechaun king, whom he's captured.  The plot developments proceeding from there are quite skillful, in my opinion.It was really helpful having the subtitles on for this movie, because they use a lot of English words, and Gaelic at times, which are unfamiliar to America.  And many of the ones which are familiar get spoken with an accent and speed hard to understand without the subtitles.  (Thank you, Disney, for including them for deaf people, thus also making it easier for non-deaf people to understand the movie!)The various elements in the movie are a lot of fun, at least for me.  I think if you give it a chance, you'll pretty soon warm up to its charm and enjoy the special homely world it creates.(Notice the date of this review.)",5,"A Disney DVD that has special features!

The film ably captures all the beauty and wonder of Irish folkbelief and transfers it to the screen with considerable charm, it is indeed a film the whole family can enjoy (although young kids may find the banshee a bit frightening).Kudos to the cast, who really bring this film to life. Albert Sharpe is great as the lay about but loveable Darby O'Gill and the beautiful Janet Munro lights up every scene she's in playing Darby's daughter and Sean Connery's love interest. BTW this is the film that producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman found their James Bond in while casting about for a little film they were making called &quot;Dr. No.&quot;As to the issue of widescreen here is the official word from Disney (as included on a flyer in the DVD):&quot;Darby O'Gill and the Little People is presented as it was originally shot, in a 1.33;1 aspect ratio. When released to theaters in 1959, the studio recommended projecting the image at 1.75:1, to satisy the public's growing appetite for widescreen movies.

396756,AMF5LHI9IOIH1,630402925X,Irishgirl,"[2, 6]","Those days of Walt Disney movies are timeless, fun, humorous, adventurous, heart-warming and perfect for the family. ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"" is no exception. This magical film, created in 1959, gives you a ""wee bit"" of that Irish charm that you will want to see over and over.Let me start by saying that I'm only 24 years old and grew up with this movie. I remember going to a movie theater to watch this with my parents as a little kid, though I could never understand all of it at the time. On a personal note, my family and I are very proud of our Irish heritage and take great pride in watching this movie. It is great for St. Patrick's day or any time of the year.This movie is about a loveable, funny and feisty Irishman named Darby O'Gill played wonderfully by the late Albert Sharpe, and his adventures with the Little People. Darby lives for making his beautiful daughter Katie (played by the late Janet Monroe) happy, as well as tending to the ""Gatehouse"" for the Lord Fitzpatrick, and most of all, catching the eye of the leprechauns and telling stories in the pub about their leader, King Brian (a fantastic performance by the late Jimmy O'Dea). Who wouldn't want to run into the spunky little King and ask for ""three grand wishes?"" From a crock of gold, to a crock of potatoes, you can have what you desire (but don't wish a fourth mind you, or you will lose everything!)For you Sean Connery fans, you're in for a real treat. A young and handsome Connery plays Michael McBride, a man from Dublin who has come to take Darby's place in working under Fitzpatrick. When McBride moves into the ""Gatehouse"" with Darby and Katie, a gradual attraction starts to form between Katie and Michael. You kind of get a sense of family there with Katie, Micheal and Darby. But a couple mischievous people; a wisecracking, barhopping jerk named Pony and his elderly mother, have plans of their own. Pony wants to be the one to take Darby's place and he will go to various lengths from harassing Katie, to beating Michael over the head and making him look like a drunk. His nosy mother meanwhile is busy sticking her nose where it doesn't belong at the ""Gatehouse."" Though Katie thinks she's a ""poor old woman,"" her father Darby thinks otherwise.The adventure with the ""Little People"" begins when Darby attempts to capture his runaway horse, Cleopatra. After the horse becomes possessed by mysterious powers (probably caused by the ""Little People""), the horse makes Darby fall into what looks like a well. The leprechauns find him and take him to a large room where leprechauns can be seen from end to end dancing their hearts out rapidly to an Irish jig played by King Brian on a bagpipe. There, Darby is greeted by the little King and is invited to stay with them, without going back. Energetic Darby entertains the ""Little People"" with a catchy Irish jig he brings forth from a violin. This is one of the best parts of the movie, where the dancing and the music get faster and faster, and the little people end up taking off on their little white horses for the ""fox chase.""But cunning Darby has plans. After escaping from the home of the leprechauns, Darby returns to his home to await a disgruntled King Brian, who is angry with Darby for leaving. But the contagious pair eventually break into one of the funniest parts of the movie where they drink Irish liquor and play ""the Wishing Song."" The Little King ends up getting drunk as a skunk, loses track of time and before he knows it, it's daylight; a time where he cannot use his powers to escape. Now he is at Darby's mercy and Darby uses one of his wishes in wishing King Brian to stay with him until he makes his final two. So Darby in the meantime, takes to toting King Brian around in a sack over his shoulder and boasting about how he ""captured the King of the Little People.""But King Brian will not be going home so soon. For Darby wants to make sure Katie is ""pleased"" and has what she desires before he makes any more wishes. The key here is to somehow get Katie and Michael together. So King Brian takes to ""visiting Katie and Michael's dreams"" where he tries to persuade the two that they should be together and are meant for each other. But it seems that Katie and Michael are not ready for commitment yet.But things start to take a turn for the worst after Katie receives a note telling her that she and her father must move from the Gatehouse immediately to make way for Michael to take Darby's place. Unfortunately the Gatehouse had become a home to Darby and Katie especially. Darby knew that they were on borrowed time in the Gatehouse, but he failed to tell Katie about it right away, for fear of upsetting her. So Katie eventually found out the hard way. When Michael walks in on Katie as she's packing, Katie lashes out at Michael for not telling her of the arrangements. Despite Michael expressing his love to Katie and his wish to marry her, Katie storms out of the Gatehouse and eventually winds up at the pub where Darby is there with King Brian in the bag. In a desperate attempt to get her father's attention, Katie throws the bag to the ground and King Brian, appearing as a rabbit, escapes.Later that night, Katie has another confrontation with Michael in the barn near the Gatehouse. Despite Michael's attempts to stop Katie from going to the mountainside to catch her father's horse Cleopatera, Katie slaps him in the face and walks out and up the mountainside. Later on, Darby finds Michael after Pony had beaten him over the head and poured liquor over him in an attempt to make him look like a drunk when the Lord Fitzpatrick would come by. Darby and Michael are beginning to talk when the ghostly wail of the Banshee glides eerily through the dark. Darby knows what this means. The Banshee is almost like an Irish reaper; a ghost that resembles death or someone about to die. Darby knows now that they have to find Katie.Darby and Michael take off to the mountainside littered with rocks and old castle ruins. They call for Katie and look high and low. Then Darby spots his horse looking over the edge of a cliff and runs to where the horse was and looks over the side to find Katie lying on the ground unconscious. As he approaches Katie, lightning crashing around him, he looks up to see the Banshee. With some terrific special effects for a 1959 movie, the Banshee appears; ghostly white and transparent coming toward them through the air. Darby tries to shoo the Banshee away from Katie and after he throws his lantern at the ghost, she finally disappears.After Michael and Darby take Katie home, they find that she is feverish and on the edge of death. Not only that but the dreaded Banshee is still lurking around and Darby, in desperation, takes off after the Banshee, swinging a shovel at her. So to make matters worse, the Banshee beckons the ""The Death Coach"" to come for Katie. And with more great 1959 special effects, a ghostly image of a coach with the eerie sound of galloping horse hooves comes out of the darkness. Darby is terrified and calls out for King Brian who eventually appears. Despite Darby's wishes for Brian to send the Death Coach away, Brian is unable to do so, as it is ""not within his powers."" So a desperate Darby makes his third wish; to let the Death Coach take him instead of Katie. Very reluctantly and sadly, Brian grants his wish and not long after, the Coach comes up to Darby and in an echoing voice, the headless horseman orders Darby to get into the Coach. Slowly and reluctantly, Darby gets into the Coach.But Darby has a surprise visitor awaiting him in the Coach. It's none other than King Brian, who gives Darby the good news that Katie's fever broke as soon as he had stepped into the Coach. After a humble and mournful Darby expresses his thanks and talks of how ""it's better for the old to die than the young,"" King Brian cleverly tricks Darby into making a fourth wish which means he loses all his wishes. So Brian, with that little contagious laugh, basically pushes Darby out of the Coach with the power exerted from his finger and Darby is left back in front of his home in a puddle of rain.From then on, everything is on the up and up. Katie gets well again and she and Michael rekindle their romance. Darby gets to brag to the guys at the pub of how he must be the only man to have survived riding in the Death Coach, while Michael gets to beat the heck out of Pony for beating him over the head and making him look like a drunk. But I guess when it's all said and done, you can thank King Brian for his lessons well taught.You know, sometimes when I think of a movie from the 50's or before, I have to laugh at the cheesy special effects that they must have. But when it comes to ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People,"" I do not laugh. Only Disney could pull off such fantastic special effects for the era. In addition to the great work with the Banshee and the Death Coach, there is also the way they made the ""Little People"" (played of course by regular sized people) actually look like little people, especially when next to the regular-sized Darby O'Gill. That was very well done.As I mentioned before, you get plenty of Irish charm in this film from Irish jigs, Irish liquor, and such catch phrases as ""I'll kill ya dead and murder ya entirely,"" ""Ah, the devil take ya!"" ""he'll put the come-heather on you and make you his slave for ever more,"" and ""hold your whist!"" You also get a good taste of what life and culture is like in Ireland and how the people are with one another. I personally hope I get to visit this land of my roots someday.This timeless film holds the perfect blend of drama, humor, adventure and spookiness all rolled into one. It is a ""grand"" movie that the family will love and the acting is very well done. You'll love listening to the distinctive Irish accents and those Irish songs such as ""My Pretty Irish Girl"" and ""She Is My Dear My Darling One,"" will get stuck in your head.This is a charming movie and worth a crock of gold! You'll also get a few crowned jewels with the special features that are provided on this DVD.",5,Ahh...Tis Grand!,1122940800,"08 2, 2005",2005,10108,"['days', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'movies', 'are',

396758,A22ZVE83UJ6YGT,630402925X,Jack  Levic,"[0, 0]","I have to admit I have had this film for a long time and never had any real interest in seeing. The fact that a very young Sean Connery was a star in the film had always been a curiosity point. A friend recently recommended it, but I still hesitated. A silly film about leprechauns? I imagined bad special effects with the ""little people"" and a tedious story. I finally watched the film and was in for a very pleasant surprise.Darby O'Gill has an encounter with Brian, King of the Leprechauns. Darby demands his three wishes but King Brian knows how to trick Darby out his wishes. This becomes a fun running theme as the two try to outwit each other.Soon, Darby is replaced as caretaker of Lord Fitzpatrick's estate by a young lad named Michael from Dublin. Michael's a decent man and falls for Darby's daughter Katie. It seems like a dream match but nothing in life is ever easy. King Brian seems to be genuinely fond of Darby and wants to help him with his troubles. Darby is actually mean to King Brian and  connives to get his three wishes granted.Yes, this is a bit of lighthearted silliness but it's also a bit of fun fantasy. The story takes a dark turn when mythical Banshee comes to pay a visit. Now Brian and Darby have to join forces and work together.Actor Sean Connery has to ease his Scottish accent into an Irish one. Albert Sharpe was a retired actor who was convinced to return to work as Darby O'Gill. His classic Irish accent can be hard to understand at times. Sean Connery actually sings in this film and yes, he can sing. Apparently, the song was a hit in its day.The true marvel of this film is the special effects. The movie was made in 1959 yet most of the effects have stood the test of time. How did they make the ""little people"" so little compared to the ""normal"" size people. Darby dances with the little people. The little people ride little horses across the countryside. Only when the Banshee shows up do the effects look dated. Do yourself a favor and make sure your version of the film has the extras. It is amazing what the ingenious talent at Walt Disney Studios were able to do long before the computer special effects. It was simple creativity and amazing talent. Also, don't miss the insightful talk given by Sean Connery and he explains how he was cast in the roll.Treat yourself to ""the little people"" of Ireland in this overlooked Disney classic.",4,AN OVERLOOKED DISNEY GEM AMAZING SPECIAL EFFECTS,1318982400,"10 19, 2011",2011,2388,"['have', 'admit', 'have', 'had', 'film', 'long', 'time', 'never', 'had', 'real', 'interest', 'seeing', 'fact', 'very', 'young', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'was', 'star', 'film', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'curiosity', 'point', 'friend', 'recently', 'recommended', 'still', 'hesitated', 'A', 'silly', 'film', 'leprechauns', 'imagined', 'bad', 'special', 'effects', 'little', 'people', 'tedious', 'story', 'finally', 'watched', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'pleasant', 'surprise.Darby', ""O'Gill"", 'encounter', 'Brian', 'King', 'Leprechauns', 'Darby', 'three', 'wishes', 'King', 'Brian', 'how', 'trick', 'Darby', 'wishes', 'fun', 'running', 'theme', 'two', 'try', 'outwit', 'other.Soon', 'Darby', 'replaced', 'caretaker', 'Lord', 'Fitzpatrick', 'estate', 'young', 'lad', 'named', 'Michael', 'Dublin', 'Michael', 'decent', 'man', 'Darby', 'daughter', 'Katie', 'dream', 'match', 'nothing', 'life', 'ever', 'easy', 'King', 'Brian', 'be', 'genuinely', 'fond', 'Darby', 'help', 'troubles', 'Darby', 'actually', 'mean', 'King', 'Brian', 'connives', 'get', 'three', 'wishes', 'granted.Yes', 'bit', 'lighthearted', 'silliness', 'also', 'bit', 'fun', 'fantasy', 'story', 'dark', 'turn', 'when', 'mythical', 'Banshee', 'pay', 'visit', 'Now', 'Brian', 'Darby', 'have', 'join', 'forces', 'work', 'together.Actor', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'ease', 'Scottish', 'accent', 'Irish', 'one', 'Albert', 'Sharpe', 'was', 'retired', 'actor', 'who', 'was', 'convinced', 'return', 'work', 'Darby', ""O'Gill"", 'classic', 'Irish', 'accent', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'understand', 'times', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'actually', 'film', 'yes', 'can', 'sing', 'Apparently', 'song', 'was', 'hit', 'day.The', 'true', 'marvel', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1959', 'yet', 'most', 'effects', 'have', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'How', 'did', 'make', 'little', 'people', 'so', 'little', 'compared', 'normal', 'size', 'people', 'Darby', 'little', 'people', 'little', 'people', 'ride', 'little', 'horses', 'countryside', 'Only', 'when', 'Banshee', 'up', 'do', 'effects', 'look', 'dated', 'Do', 'favor', 'make', 'sure', 'version', 'film', 'extras', 'amazing', 'what', 'ingenious', 'talent', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Studios', 'were', 'able', 'do', 'long', 'computer', 'special', 'effects', 'was', 'simple', 'creativity', 'amazing', 'talent', 'Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'insightful', 'talk', 'given', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'how', 'was', 'cast', 'roll.Treat', 'little', 'people', 'Ireland', 'overlooked', 'Disney', 'classic']",Darby O'Gill & The Little People VHS

396765,A3QTP2CI1BDV0M,630402925X,"Jim O'Brien ""JamesMark""","[7, 15]","""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"" is given some highly rated reviews here at Amazon.com (which is why I bought it) but it misses the mark, I think, when it comes to being the type of movie we want to watch again and again.Darby O'Gill is the name of an old Irish man who is a poor caretaker for a rich man's estate in a small Irish village around the year 1900.  Darby and his daughter Katie have lived in the gate house (on the estate) for more than 20 years, but old Darby would rather spend his time at the local pub ... drinking stout (a strong dark beer) and telling his leprechaun stories ... instead of doing his caretaker work ... which is why the estate owner decides to bring in a new man (Michael) to replace him ... forcing Darby and his daughter to move out.But Darby lives a charmed life in that he is the only person in the village who has seen real live leprechauns.  Some of the people in the village believe Darby's stories ... some don't ... but Darby himself never wavers in his respect and honor for ""the little people"".  Darby also tries to out-fox the leprechauns ... matching wits with the king leprechaun himself ... to get the three wishes that are given to anyone who captures a leprechaun.  It is during these encounters that the movie is at its most fun.  Darby's daughter Katie and the new caretaker Michael hit it off, and this gives the movie some moments of romance too.  But there are also some ... unsavory story lines in ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"" and it is at these moments that we want to use the ""fast forward"" button to get to the fun parts.Albert Sharpe was hand-picked by Walt Disney to play Darby, and he delivers his lines convincingly ... with flair and humor ... but he is, well, hard to look at, and it is hard to want to be on his side.  Janet Munro was chosen to play Katie, and she is pretty and all that, but she doesn't have the depth of goodness ... the honesty and humbleness of spirit ... that makes a girl pretty on the inside ... something I think it is fair to expect from a poor Irish girl like Katie.  Sean Connery plays Michael, and he mugs it up for the camers pretty much, but he doesn't really look or act like a caretaker.

This is an advantage: it lets you view this movie two different ways:--In ""full frame,"" you can see everything the camera saw, because this transfer is frame-line-to-frame-line with no cropping.--Depending on your TV, you might also enlarge the picture to fill your 16-by-9 widescreen TV, and view the movie as it appeared in movie theaters (with a ""soft matte"" from the projector's aperture plate) to approximately 1.75-to-1.  The ""matted"" version as actually more dramatic and reveals ""Darby O'Gill"" as a different movie with a much more cinematic composition.Finally, make sure your DVD includes the ""I Captured The King of the Leprechauns"" episode of the Disney TV show starring Walt Disney himself.  Walt acts and jokes his way through the 45-minute fictional account of finding leprechauns for the movie, showing that he could do drama and comedy with the best of them.  (His best deadpan line is asking whether he could bring back a leprechaun on the plane from Ireland in a cardboard box.)

So this is where you would go if you wanted to look at Irish legend told through Disney's famous factory of observation and fun.Of course for those who like looking at ""stars before they were stars"" the movie reveals a Sean Connery whom some will not recognize because he's just so darn young!  Connery had filmed a few movies earlier in the UK, and I suppose Disney executives thought that if his name was ""Sean,"" he might be Irish as John Ford (who sometimes said his name was ""Sean"") and cast him as an Irish woodsman with a huge crush on Janet Munro.  Well, both Munro and Connery and Scottish but it didn't seem to make a difference to the youth of America at which this picture was aimed.

396787,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,630402925X,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[8, 8]","Disney created a series of excellent movies in the 1950s and the early 1960s, many of them in filmed in Great Britain.  One of the best of these movies was this one, starring a very young Sean Connery as Michael McBride, Albert Sharpe in the title role, and Janet Munro as Darby's daughter Katie O'Gill.  The movie is somewhat family friendly, though there are a few moments that might be unsuitable for the youngest members of the family.Darby O'Gill has reached retirement, and Lord Fitzpatrick (Walter Fitzgerald) has decided it is time that Darby be replaced by a younger man, and Michael McBride is his choice.  As tends to be Darby's habit of recent years, when Lord Fitzpatrick arrives to give Darby the news Darby is down at the pub telling stories about the king of the Leprechauns.Darby receives the bad news soon after returning to Lord Fitzpatrick's land.  Darby delays telling Katie the bad news; this turns out to be a mistake.  The pace of the story picks up rapidly.  We learn that Sheelah Segrue (Estelle Winwood), who looks much like a witch, wants to have her bully son Pony Sugrue (Kieran Moore) replace Darby and marry Katie.  Sheelah does her best to manipulate events both directly and by pushing her son to discredit Michael.The highlight of this movie is Darby O'Gill and his encounters with King Brian (Jimmy O'Dea), King of the Leprechauns, and the little people.  Darby falls into the underground world of the Leprechauns, and the special effects there are marvelous.  In one of the best special effects scenes in the movie we see Darby O'Gill with the little people dancing and later riding horses around him, and yet the scene appears natural without any of the telltale signs that you often see with various project effects.The story ups the ante when Darby deliberately captures King Brian in order to make his life and that of Katie more secure.  In this part of the movie I had to wonder whether the story we heard Darby tell at the beginning of the movie about his encounter with King Brian was true, because Darby is careful and thoughtful with his wishes.Eventually the movie arrives at a point where the truth must be told, and Katie literally faces death.  Darby must make difficult choices if he is to have a chance to save Katie and to have everything come out in the end.This movie is a rarity, a Disney movie with substantial special effects that has aged well.  The use of native Irish actors was a big plus because the accents were real.  Albert Sharpe is the centerpiece of this movie, playing Darby O'Gill as though he was Darby.  This movie was the next to last movie in which Albert appeared, which is ironic and fitting given that Sean Connery and Janet Munro were both just beginning careers.What of Mr. Connery, the future James Bond and now one of the best actors in the world?  He shows a lot of promise in this movie with his understated performance.  I consider both Connery and Munro's performances to be among the best in this movie.  Connery also sings a song, and he does fine.Disney produced a number of good films during Walt Disney's last years.  This particular movie was supposedly a personal project of Walt's.  I think that this movie is a credit to Walt Disney's creativity and his insistence on quality.  I think this DVD release would make Walt Disney proud, particularly the making of feature.  Disney liked to charm and delight his audiences, but he also enjoyed revealing secrets, and showing how this charming movie was made would have made him happy.

Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.Darby O'Gill (Albert Sharpe) is an aged  widower, living with his adorable daughter Katie (Janet Munro) on a farm near the town of Rathcullen For a very long time he was the caretaker of Lord Fitzpatrick's (Walter Fitzgerald) estate - but he is now retiring and his replacement is a young guy from Dublin, a certain Michael McBride (Sean Connery).Darby is also a kind of local celebrity, as since like always during all his pub visits he regals his friends with tales of his battle of wits with the leprechauns and in particular of his long standing rivalry with their king, Brian Connors (Jimmy O'Dea). Everybody (OK, almost everybody) loves Darby O'Gill, even if nobody believes his tall tales - but in fact they are all very much real and this film tells the story of the ultimate and the most dramatic episode in this &#34;Darby O'Gill vs. Leprechauns&#34; match of century...This is a lovely, charming, adorable family film exploring in detail and with great care Irish folk legends. The two main actors, Albert Sharpe and Jimmy O'Dea, are absolutely splendid as two old &#34;frenemies&#34; who enjoy a lot their rivalry, which they interrupt only occasionally to get drunk together...))) Janet Munro is cute like a button in this film and she gives a great show - it is really heartbreaking that she was taken away by a deadly disease so early (she died in 1972, aged only 38). Young Sean Connery is of course a pleasure to watch in one of his first real roles (his earlier appearances were frequently not even credited) - this film certainly helped him a lot, even if his great break didn't come before 1962...MEDICAL WARNING: if you are alergic to Irish folk legends, Irish accents, Irishness in general, Disney family films, singing, handsome young men courting bonnie lassies, happy endings, merry cheerfulness, good ale, sense of honour, friendship, joy of life, pranks, riddles, battles of wits and especially leprechauns - well, in such case watching this film can be life-threatening. This is a SERIOUS WARNING and it should be taken seriously...)))This film may be a little bit difficult to understand for the younger children and also, PARENTAL WARNING here, there is one scene, involving a banshee (a REALLY bad one!), which will probably scare the pants out of them - therefore this film is probably not for any kid younger than 8.Other that this one little reservation, this is an EXCELLENT, charming family film.

The size differential between the Little People and the humans is achieved through a brilliant use of the technique of forced perspective, which is nicely explained in the extras.

396804,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,630402925X,Monty Moonlight,"[6, 6]","Set in a quaint, Irish village, ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"" is the story of an old groundskeeper who lives alone with his beautiful, 20-year-old daughter, Katie, and spends most of his time in the local pub telling stories rather than keeping up with his work. Darby's stories are usually about leprechauns, with whom he has a personal acquaintance. In fact, his best friend and greatest adversary is Brian Connors, king of the little people. Our story gets started when Darby finds out he is to be replaced in his position by a much younger man, the newly arrived Michael McBride, a well-mannered, handsome Dubliner. Darby is to be comfortably retired to a smaller cottage on half-pay, but breaking the news of the change to Katie will be no easy thing. He convinces young Michael to let him break the news to Katie in his own time, and invites the lad to move in right away rather than wait for he and his daughter to move out. A mutual attraction is instantly noticeable between Katie and Michael, and it seems like the three could be one happy family if it weren't for the secret of the O'Gills' eviction being kept. The odds soon change in Darby's favor, however, when an attempt by King Brian to rescue Darby from his worldly troubles goes wrong and suddenly finds him having to grant Darby his three wishes. Darby makes his first wish so that King Brian will have to stay by his side until he decides on the second and third, hoping this will give him time to wish-up a solution to his problem of securing his unmarried daughter's future. This is a dangerous game, however, as keeping King Brian prisoner can have dire consequences from the supernatural realm under his control!If you are a Disney fanatic, a Saint Patrick's Day reveler, or just a collector of the greatest fantasy films of all-time, Disney's 1959 classic ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"" is a must own! With an outstanding cast and baffling special effects that still hold up well today (one or two minor moments aside), ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"" spins an Irish tale of leprechauns, banshees, and ghostly coaches the likes of which you've never seen! Sean Connery stars in one of his earliest film roles as the charming Michael McBride, Janet Munro is his gorgeous, fiery-tempered love-interest, Katie O'Gill, and Albert Sharpe and Jimmy O'Dea take center stage as Darby and King Brian respectively. Kieron Moore is also worth mentioning as the villainous rival for Katie's affections, Pony Sugrue, as is Estelle Winwood as his scheming mother. The film features wonderful music and a couple of delightful songs, plus the brilliant direction of Disney legend Robert Stevenson. The DVD release is a winner as well! The film is appropriately in widescreen with the original audio track and a gorgeous picture, there are fun, animated menus, and even three excellent bonus features! ""Mr. Connery Goes to Hollywood"" is a new featurette that successfully turns its insightful interview with Sean Connery into a sort of ""making of"" experience. ""Little People, Big Effects"" gives us a fascinating look at the amazing techniques used to make Darby's leprechauns look so small, among other neat illusions. And, finally, we get a full episode of the Disneyland anthology series, ""I Captured the King of the Leprechauns,"" in which Walt Disney, at the suggestion of celebrity-friend Pat O'Brien, takes a trip to Ireland to learn about leprechauns and capture some to star in his film. This last bonus is a must see for fans of the film, and includes wonderful scenes like Walt learning the origin of the little people, and his first meeting with Darby O'Gill and King Brian! It was Walt's wish to convince movie-goers that the leprechauns in his film were the real deal, and this excellent episode of the Disney TV series was a great example of his attempts (and a great chance to see Walt starring throughout).I highly recommend ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"" to anyone with an interest in the subject matter. It's truly one of Disney's greatest masterpieces, one of my own favorite films of all-time, and a must for any serious DVD collection. Pick it up, and it will surely become a well-loved and anticipated St. Patrick's Day tradition for you and your family!",5,Disney live-action at its best!,1175040000,"03 28, 2007",2007,4258,"['Set', 'quaint', 'Irish', 'village', 'Darby', ""O'Gill"", 'Little', 'People', 'story', 'old', 'groundskeeper', 'who', 'alone', 'beautiful', '20-year-old', 'daughter', 'Katie', 'most', 'time', 'local', 'pub', 'telling', 'stories', 'rather', 'keeping', 'up', 'work', 'Darby', 'stories', 'are', 'usually', 'leprechauns', 'whom', 'personal', 'acquaintance', 'fact', 'best', 'friend', 'greatest', 'adversary', 'Brian', 'Connors', 'king', 'little', 'people', 'story', 'started', 'when', 'Darby', 'out', 'be', 'replaced', 'position', 'much', 'younger', 'man', 'newly', 'arrived', 'Michael', 'McBride', 'well-mannered', 'handsome', 'Dubliner', 'Darby', 'be', 'comfortably', 'retired', 'smaller', 'cottage', 'half-pay', 'breaking', 'news', 'change', 'Katie', 'will', 'be', 'easy', 'thing', 'young', 'Michael', 'let', 'break', 'news', 'Katie', 'own', 'time', 'lad', 'move', 'right', 'away', 'rather', 'wait', 'daughter', 'move', 'out', 'mutual', 'attraction', 'instantly', 'noticeable', 'Katie', 'Michael', 'three', 'could', 'be', 'one', 'happy', 'family', 'were', ""n't"", 'secret', ""O'Gills"", 'eviction', 'being', 'kept', 'odds', 'soon', 'change', 'Darby', 'favor', 'however', 'when', 'attempt', 'King', 'Brian', 'rescue', 'Darby', 'worldly', 'troubles', 'wrong', 'suddenly', 'having', 'grant', 'Darby', 'three', 'wishes', 'Darby', 'first', 'wish', 'so', 'King', 'Brian', 'will', 'have', 'stay', 'side', 'second', 'third', 'hoping', 'will', 'give', 'time', 'wish-up', 'solution', 'problem', 'securing', 'unmarried', 'daughter', 'future', 'dangerous', 'game', 'however', 'keeping', 'King', 'Brian', 'prisoner', 'can', 'have', 'dire', 'consequences', 'supernatural', 'realm', 'control', 'are', 'Disney', 'fanatic', 'Saint', 'Patrick', 'Day', 'reveler', 'just', 'collector', 'greatest', 'fantasy', 'films', 'all-time', 'Disney', '1959', 'classic', 'Darby', ""O'Gill"", 'Little', 'People', 'must', 'own', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'baffling', 'special', 'effects', 'still', 'hold', 'up', 'well', 'today', 'one', 'two', 'minor', 'moments', 'aside', 'Darby', ""O'Gill"", 'Little', 'People', 'Irish', 'tale', 'leprechauns', 'banshees', 'ghostly', 'likes', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'stars', 'one', 'earliest', 'film', 'roles', 'charming', 'Michael', 'McBride', 'Janet', 'Munro', 'gorgeous', 'fiery-tempered', 'love-interest', 'Katie', ""O'Gill"", 'Albert', 'Sharpe', 'Jimmy', ""O'Dea"", 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'Darby', 'King', 'Brian', 'respectively', 'Kieron', 'Moore', 'also', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'villainous', 'rival', 'Katie', 'affections', 'Pony', 'Sugrue', 'Estelle', 'Winwood', 'scheming', 'mother', 'film', 'wonderful', 'music', 'couple', 'delightful', 'songs', 'brilliant', 'direction', 'Disney', 'legend', 'Robert', 'Stevenson', 'DVD', 'release', 'winner', 'well', 'film', 'appropriately', 'widescreen', 'original', 'audio', 'track', 'gorgeous', 'picture', 'are', 'fun', 'animated', 'menus', 'even', 'three', 'excellent', 'bonus', 'Mr.', 'Connery', 'Goes', 'Hollywood', 'new', 'featurette', 'successfully', 'insightful', 'interview', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'sort', 'making', 'experience', 'Little', 'People', 'Big', 'Effects', 'fascinating', 'look', 'amazing', 'techniques', 'used', 'make', 'Darby', 'leprechauns', 'look', 'so', 'small', 'other', 'neat', 'illusions', 'finally', 'get', 'full', 'episode', 'Disneyland', 'anthology', 'series', 'Captured', 'King', 'Leprechauns', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'suggestion', 'celebrity-friend', 'Pat', ""O'Brien"", 'trip', 'Ireland', 'learn', 'leprechauns', 'capture', 'star', 'film', 'last', 'bonus', 'must', 'see', 'fans', 'film', 'wonderful', 'scenes', 'Walt', 'learning', 'origin', 'little', 'people', 'first', 'meeting', 'Darby', ""O'Gill"", 'King', 'Brian', 'was', 'Walt', 'wish', 'convince', 'movie-goers', 'leprechauns', 'film', 'were', 'real', 'deal', 'excellent', 'episode', 'Disney', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'great', 'example', 'attempts', 'great', 'chance', 'see', 'Walt', 'starring', '.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Darby', ""O'Gill"", 'Little', 'People', 'anyone', 'interest', 'subject', 'matter', 'truly', 'one', 'Disney', 'greatest', 'masterpieces', 'one', 'own', 'favorite', 'films', 'all-time', 'must', 'serious', 'DVD', 'collection', 'Pick', 'up', 'will', 'surely', 'become', 'well-loved', 'anticipated', 'St.', 'Patrick', 'Day', 'tradition', 'family']",Darby O'Gill & The Little People VHS

And now, the best DVD you could imagine! The film could stand on its own, and at a good price. The extras are generous...2 short documentaries, and a scripted ""making of"" involving Disney himself. Loads of fun! The wonderful Albert Sharpe came out of retirement to make this, and he is sharp as a tack; a thoroughly complete performance. He should've had Oscar recognition. For that matter, this film was not nominated for any Oscars at all. The sweet ballad ""Irish Lass"", though a hit at the time, was ignored, as well as the wonderful Special Effects...and, sadly, Sharpe's performance. The most interesting element of the film is seeing Sean Connery with hair (?); he gives a fine performance and isn't that bad a singer; good insight about how he got this role, in the extras, but I won't blab away the stuff. Janet Munro made her Disney debut, here, and he used her in many others (I liked her in ""Swiss Family Robinson""). I don't know what happened to her. She later gave a remarkable performance in ""The Day the Earth Caught Fire""; I really like her a lot. She is a natural beauty.  This is PURE Disney...sweet, serious, and especially, great for kids.

And it's all based on myth, folklore, and tales from Ireland, while being executed brilliantly.I did manage to see some behind the special effects on an old Disney show, and they showed the extensive use of paintings and illustration to preshow the outlook of the final scenes to be filmed. Boy, does that preparation show.I've honestly put myself aside from knowing too much about the special effect process deliberately in order not to blow the awe I still have for some special scenes. The sequence where Darby is seen walking though the middle of magical underworld is mindboggling to say the least. The detail couldn't be more perfect. And to me, that's what this movie is really all about! The charisma between Darby and the mythical folk, and his dealings with the townspeople in order to establish them-as real.Awesome Disney movie, filmed beautifully with the most colorful special effects, even for this day and age.

Ellenshaw was a matte painter par excellance who worked on major british fantasy films like Things To Come before getting work with Disney. In the later youtube sections, they discuss and show the work in creating the visual effects and matte art for this remarkable film. The genius of this film is that they created absolutely seamless effects that equal the similar work done in Lord of The Rings, combining the ""little"" people and normal sized ones in various situations. And, they did it with moving cameras all without post optical effects. So, I had to check this film out. What I didn't expect is the richness of the characters and the faithfulness to the original story's colorful language. Other amazon reviewers have mentioned the acting of Albert Sharpe, and the fact that he was not nominated for an academy award. Man are they right on the button. What rich and wonderful notes this man has. His instrument is of the caliber of Charles Laughton, and the best of the best character actors. Even without the marvelous tone of the production values and energetic Sean Connery and Janet Munro performances, Sharpes acting is a thing to behold. The thing about the best Disney is simply the incredibly high quality of the entire productions. And this film doesn't mind scaring the kiddies either.

This films a mystical Irish tale about Leprecahns and Ghosts and a lovable old Irish man named Darby O'Gill(played by Albert Sharpe) who befriends the king of the Leprecahns . One essential element of this movie is the beautiful effects for the time this film came out. The Leprecahns and banshee look believable & realistic. I first saw this movie on the Disney Channel when I was young. From then on I considered it one of my favorite movies . Very memorable. Takes you to another place and time.

There is the contrast between good and evil, namely, a sneaky brute who likes to pick fights, versus Sean Connery, who is honest and charming.Fantasy scenes abound, for example we see a leprechaun being changed into a rabbit.  We see mountainsides spontaneously opening up where inside can be found dancing leprechauns and treasure chests spilling over with gold coins.DARBY O'GILL AND THE LITTLE PEOPLE is set in a small Irish town. Darby O'Gill is an old widower who likes to pass the time telling stories at the pub, to the delight and disbelief of others. As long as town priest Father Murphy isn't around, Darby spins yarns about the little people who he has encountered at a hilltop known as Knocknasheega. Meanwhile, Katie, his daughter, is content to take care of things at home, and insists she doesn't have time or great desire for a love.One day Lord Fitzpatrick arrives in town and delivers the news that Darby is to be replaced as caretaker of the Lord's estate. Rather than upset his daughter with the word of his retirement, Darby tells her that the caretaker-to-be is merely helping with some house work. That man is Sean Connery, a polite, young fellow who feels that Darby should let his daughter in on things.Darby has another task in mind. He's to ride into the next town and bring back the new church bell for Father Murphy. At night, while he's trying to get his horse, he falls down the well atop Knocknasheega and plummets down the well and into the world of leprechauns.Here, a wonderland sequence depicts Darby amongst countless leprechauns. Darby encounters the legendary King Brian Connors the 5,000-year-old leprechaun monarch (just under two feet tall). King Brian explains that Darby has been brought to their world as a favor, allowing him to escape the disappointing early retirement he faces in the other world. This scene is accompanied by Irish fiddle music, fiddling with lightning speed.The leprechauns can only work their magic when it is dark out, and while a leprechaun will grant you three wishes, making a fourth wish negates the three before. General merriment ensues as Darby plays the fiddle and the leprechauns do hundreds of heel clicks and assorted clogging steps. The music, supplied by fiddles and pipes, is a wonder to behold.In another scene, Darby tricks the King into staying with him all night, in an episode where Darby and the King exchange dozens of silly rhymes. The exchange of rhymes occurs in a barn, and a nearby horse engages in many amusing expressions, a feature of the film sure to amuse every kid. Another highlight, is that Darby teases the King by allowing a cat to chase the King about the barn, and the King hides behind the spokes of a wagon wheel to protect himself, the spokes resembling a jail cell. The King and Darby resume their laughing exchange of silly poems, but once the rooster crows at dawn, and the sun comes out, the King has lost his powers (e.g., to jump through doorways) and Darby succeeds in capturing the King and puts him into a bag. Then Darby demands his three wishes. (I don't reveal the ending.)I saw this movie when it first came out, in a theater in Philadelphia.  It was a hot day.  I was only eight.  Although the movie has scary parts, I was not particularly scared.  I found the banshee part about as scary as the plague scene in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, a movie released a year or so before DARBY O'GILL.",5,"Excellent image quality, charming special effects.",1210032000,"05 6, 2008",2008,3631,"['First', 'all', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'videotape', 'version', 'blurry', 'almost', 'unwatchable', 'DVD', 'version', 'crystal', 'clear', 'as', 'sharp', 'contemporary', 'television', 'program.The', 'story', 'excellent', 'kids', 'contrast', 'good', 'evil', 'namely', 'sneaky', 'brute', 'who', 'pick', 'fights', 'versus', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'who', 'honest', 'charming.Fantasy', 'scenes', 'abound', 'example', 'see', 'leprechaun', 'being', 'changed', 'rabbit', 'see', 'mountainsides', 'spontaneously', 'opening', 'up', 'where', 'inside', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'dancing', 'leprechauns', 'treasure', 'chests', 'spilling', 'gold', 'coins.DARBY', ""O'GILL"", 'THE', 'LITTLE', 'PEOPLE', 'set', 'small', 'Irish', 'town', 'Darby', ""O'Gill"", 'old', 'widower', 'who', 'pass', 'time', 'telling', 'stories', 'pub', 'delight', 'disbelief', 'others', 'As', 'long', 'town', 'priest', 'Father', 'Murphy', ""n't"", 'around', 'Darby', 'yarns', 'little', 'people', 'who', 'encountered', 'hilltop', 'known', 'Knocknasheega', 'Meanwhile', 'Katie', 'daughter', 'content', 'take', 'care', 'things', 'home', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'great', 'desire', 'love.One', 'day', 'Lord', 'Fitzpatrick', 'town', 'news', 'Darby', 'be', 'replaced', 'caretaker', 'Lord', 'estate', 'Rather', 'upset', 'daughter', 'word', 'retirement', 'Darby', 'caretaker-to-be', 'merely', 'helping', 'house', 'work', 'man', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'polite', 'young', 'fellow', 'who', 'Darby', 'should', 'let', 'daughter', 'things.Darby', 'task', 'mind', 'ride', 'next', 'town', 'bring', 'back', 'new', 'church', 'bell', 'Father', 'Murphy', 'night', 'trying', 'get', 'horse', 'down', 'well', 'atop', 'Knocknasheega', 'plummets', 'down', 'well', 'world', 'leprechauns.Here', 'wonderland', 'sequence', 'depicts', 'Darby', 'amongst', 'countless', 'leprechauns', 'Darby', 'legendary', 'King', 'Brian', 'Connors', '5,000-year-old', 'leprechaun', 'monarch', 'just', 'two', 'feet', 'tall', 'King', 'Brian', 'explains', 'Darby', 'been', 'brought', 'world', 'favor', 'allowing', 'escape', 'disappointing', 'early', 'retirement', 'other', 'world', 'scene', 'accompanied', 'Irish', 'fiddle', 'music', 'fiddling', 'lightning', 'speed.The', 'leprechauns', 'can', 'only', 'work', 'magic', 'when', 'dark', 'leprechaun', 'will', 'grant', 'three', 'wishes', 'making', 'fourth', 'wish', 'three', 'General', 'merriment', 'ensues', 'Darby', 'fiddle', 'leprechauns', 'do', 'hundreds', 'heel', 'clicks', 'assorted', 'clogging', 'steps', 'music', 'supplied', 'fiddles', 'pipes', 'wonder', 'behold.In', 'scene', 'Darby', 'King', 'staying', 'night', 'episode', 'where', 'Darby', 'King', 'exchange', 'dozens', 'silly', 'rhymes', 'exchange', 'rhymes', 'occurs', 'barn', 'nearby', 'horse', 'engages', 'many', 'amusing', 'expressions', 'feature', 'film', 'sure', 'amuse', 'kid', 'highlight', 'Darby', 'King', 'allowing', 'cat', 'chase', 'King', 'barn', 'King', 'hides', 'spokes', 'wagon', 'wheel', 'protect', 'spokes', 'resembling', 'jail', 'cell', 'King', 'Darby', 'resume', 'laughing', 'exchange', 'silly', 'poems', 'once', 'rooster', 'dawn', 'sun', 'out', 'King', 'lost', 'powers', 'e.g.', 'jump', 'doorways', 'Darby', 'capturing', 'King', 'bag', 'Then', 'Darby', 'three', 'wishes', 'do', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'ending', 'saw', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'theater', 'Philadelphia', 'was', 'hot', 'day', 'was', 'only', 'eight', 'movie', 'scary', 'parts', 'was', 'not', 'particularly', 'scared', 'found', 'banshee', 'part', 'as', 'scary', 'plague', 'scene', 'THE', 'TEN', 'COMMANDMENTS', 'movie', 'released', 'year', 'so', 'DARBY', ""O'GILL""]",Darby O'Gill & The Little People VHS

Anyone who wants to play a ""roeper and ebert"" wanna-be with this old gem ought to spare us all.  no need for anything here, but to sit back and enjoy a vintage disney classic - i am just happy it made DVD!  enjoy!",5,Give it a Break!,1146873600,"05 6, 2006",2006,973,"['just', 'fine', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'i', 'cherish', 'wonderful', 'childhood', 'experience', 'i', 'warmly', 'remember', 'seeing', 'classic', 'grand', 'movie', 'houses', '50-60', 'give', 'break', 'how', 'cheesy', 'most', 'movies', 'were', 'just', 'back', 'then', 'individual', 'ranting', 'raving', 'anti-', 'non-irish', 'unauthentic', 'production', 'ought', 'stick', 'documentaries', 'historical', 'travel', 'otherwise', 'not', 'type', 'movie', 'vicious', 'intellectual', 'bashing', 'ha', 'get', 'life', 'one', 'know', 'like', 'old', 'disney', 'movies', 'actors', 'have', 'watch', 'want', 'watch', 'fairy', 'tale', 'enjoyable', 'and/or', 'do', 'remember', 'wonderful', 'tale', 'when', 'were', 'kid', 'possibly', 'share', 'kids', 'now', 'Anyone', 'who', 'play', 'roeper', 'ebert', 'wanna-be', 'old', 'gem', 'ought', 'spare', 'need', 'anything', 'here', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'vintage', 'disney', 'classic', 'i', 'am', 'just', 'happy', 'made', 'DVD', 'enjoy']",Darby O'Gill & The Little People VHS
