During the day, though, it might just be funny as you notice all the plot holes.I think David Cross is a decent director, and this movie definately has potential.  However, he needs to find someone else to do the writing and acting.  The acting in the movie reminded me of high school drama class.  The plot has so many nonsensical parts, as I'll explain here.Laura thinks her apartment is haunted, so she starts searching on the internet for info about ghosts.  She comes upon this ""ghost watcher"" site, which the premise is supposedly the owner has cameras all over her house so you can report any suspicious activity.  She finds this is just a front for a camwhore who is selling men access to the cameras in her house.  But for some bizarre reason, Laura decides to contact her anyway for help with her ghost problem, knowing that the site is really just a clever porn site.  Then Laura's friend begs the camwhore to help her with her ghost problem, despite the fact that both Laura and her friend know why she has a ghost problem and a internet porn star isn't really going to help with that issue. But it gives Cross the opportunity to put an idiotic and completely out of place scene of the camwhore stripping for the camera.Anyway, the camwhore comes up with the ""brilliant"" idea that somehow digging up the corpse of the ghost who's haunting Laura and ""making sure he's really dead"" will solve her problem.  I'm sure you can imagine how well THAT plan goes.  And although I don't want to give it away, the ending is lame and doesn't make sense given events that happened earlier in the movie.One thing you can say for Cross is he knows how to scare an audience, without any fancy special effects or equipment.  Now, if only he can find someone to write a horror script that makes sense, that'd be a movie I'd want to see.",2,Scary on a dark night but lacking in sense,1115769600,"05 11, 2005",2005,1940,"['Let', 'say', 'are', 'definately', 'scary', 'moments', 'film', 'especially', ""'re"", 'watching', 'night', 'day', 'though', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'funny', 'notice', 'plot', 'holes.I', 'think', 'David', 'Cross', 'decent', 'director', 'movie', 'definately', 'potential', 'However', 'find', 'someone', 'else', 'do', 'writing', 'acting', 'acting', 'movie', 'reminded', 'high', 'school', 'drama', 'class', 'plot', 'so', 'many', 'nonsensical', 'parts', ""'ll"", 'explain', 'here.Laura', 'thinks', 'apartment', 'haunted', 'searching', 'internet', 'info', 'ghosts', 'ghost', 'watcher', 'site', 'premise', 'supposedly', 'owner', 'cameras', 'house', 'can', 'report', 'suspicious', 'activity', 'just', 'front', 'camwhore', 'who', 'selling', 'men', 'access', 'cameras', 'house', 'bizarre', 'reason', 'Laura', 'contact', 'anyway', 'help', 'ghost', 'problem', 'knowing', 'site', 'really', 'just', 'clever', 'porn', 'site', 'Then', 'Laura', 'friend', 'camwhore', 'help', 'ghost', 'problem', 'fact', 'Laura', 'friend', 'know', 'why', 'ghost', 'problem', 'internet', 'porn', 'star', ""n't"", 'really', 'going', 'help', 'issue', 'Cross', 'opportunity', 'put', 'idiotic', 'completely', 'place', 'scene', 'camwhore', 'stripping', 'camera.Anyway', 'camwhore', 'up', 'brilliant', 'idea', 'somehow', 'digging', 'up', 'corpse', 'ghost', 'who', 'haunting', 'Laura', 'making', 'sure', 'really', 'dead', 'will', 'solve', 'problem', ""'m"", 'sure', 'can', 'imagine', 'how', 'well', 'plan', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'lame', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'given', 'events', 'happened', 'earlier', 'movie.One', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'Cross', 'how', 'scare', 'audience', 'fancy', 'special', 'effects', 'equipment', 'Now', 'only', 'can', 'find', 'someone', 'write', 'horror', 'script', 'sense', ""'d"", 'be', 'movie', ""'d"", 'want', 'see']",Ghost Watcher

When things start to get uneasy again, she seeks the help of Elizabeth Dean who happens to run a ghost watcher's website.

We are in her shoes yet the reason WHY she is this way isn't shoved down our throats.....it's a gradual discovery.*Story Smooth storytelling, writing, and execution. A genuine ghost story with some modern twists.*Cast/Characters Some truly talented actors in this film. No overdramtic scenes or poor stage direction. Keep your eyes peeled on this cast to appear in more films down the lines. The characters had depth, they were individuals and showed all different aspects of people you may know.*Pace The movie was over before you knew it and has you craving for more!

844597,ARIHVRQ9VH0OQ,B0002S94EI,Nick Schwartz,"[0, 0]","I've said it before about low-budget horror films: they can be great if done correctly, so it was easy for me to look past the sub-par acting, picture quality and sound of Ghost Watcher.That said, this film was one of the worst low-budget, independent horror movies that I have seen in a long time.  While, I credit it with at least having a story that carries it along, the story telling is not executed particularly well, and it winds up feeling like a very basic, boring ghost story.  There are no scares in the film, and while the composed music was actually very fitting, the heavy metal songs that plagued the rest of the film were awful and had no place in this film.What can be said about this film though, was that, while the directing was generally pretty bland, there were some particularly impressive shots, especially during the scene in the barn.  I watched that scene with commentary because I was curious as to what the filmmakers had to say about those shots, and found the commentary to be pretty enjoyable, though not enough that I would sit through this movie a second time.Also, and I feel this needs mentioning: this movie features the most blatant Evil Dead reference ever put to film.  It has nothing to do with what is happening on screen, and is an incredibly shameless attempt at an homage.  Not to mention, that Evil Dead is one of the best independent horror films of all time, and this one is very weak.And again, I give the filmmakers huge credit for making such a low-budget film, but I just think it could have been done better.Also, one more gripe, though not necessarily about the film itself, but about the DVD.  For some reason, the scene selection menu is actually within the special features menu, which may not be a big deal, but seems annoying if you plan on watching this movie more than once, since it could have been easily fixed.  A separate scene selection menu seems standard on all DVDs these days.",2,A very bad film with one or two redeeming aspects,1119398400,"06 22, 2005",2005,1946,"[""'ve"", 'said', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'great', 'done', 'correctly', 'was', 'easy', 'look', 'sub-par', 'acting', 'picture', 'quality', 'sound', 'Ghost', 'Watcher.That', 'said', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'worst', 'low-budget', 'independent', 'horror', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'credit', 'least', 'having', 'story', 'along', 'story', 'telling', 'not', 'executed', 'particularly', 'well', 'up', 'feeling', 'very', 'basic', 'boring', 'ghost', 'story', 'are', 'scares', 'film', 'composed', 'music', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'fitting', 'heavy', 'metal', 'songs', 'plagued', 'rest', 'film', 'were', 'awful', 'had', 'place', 'film.What', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'film', 'was', 'directing', 'was', 'generally', 'pretty', 'bland', 'were', 'particularly', 'impressive', 'shots', 'especially', 'scene', 'barn', 'watched', 'scene', 'commentary', 'was', 'curious', 'what', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'say', 'shots', 'found', 'commentary', 'be', 'pretty', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'would', 'sit', 'movie', 'second', 'time.Also', 'feel', 'mentioning', 'movie', 'most', 'blatant', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'reference', 'ever', 'put', 'film', 'nothing', 'do', 'what', 'happening', 'screen', 'incredibly', 'shameless', 'attempt', 'homage', 'Not', 'mention', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'one', 'best', 'independent', 'horror', 'films', 'time', 'one', 'very', 'weak.And', 'again', 'give', 'filmmakers', 'huge', 'credit', 'making', 'such', 'low-budget', 'film', 'just', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better.Also', 'one', 'more', 'gripe', 'not', 'necessarily', 'film', 'DVD', 'reason', 'scene', 'selection', 'menu', 'actually', 'special', 'features', 'menu', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'big', 'deal', 'annoying', 'plan', 'watching', 'movie', 'more', 'once', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'easily', 'fixed', 'separate', 'scene', 'selection', 'menu', 'standard', 'DVDs', 'days']",Ghost Watcher

It deals with a young girl who is afraid to go outside and leave her apartment, because she was stalked by a man 1 year ago. The man also killed her parents and brother. She fears that her apartment may have a ghost in it! So she finds a girl on the net that specializes in ghost hunting. I don't want to tell you any more than that. There are some twists to the story as well.

844599,A1M0YAZ6JV488Z,B0002S94EI,"Tom's Reviews ""Tom Hunter""","[1, 1]","For an indie horror flick, it at least kept my attention.  If you can ignore the sometimes poor acting, and the limited budget (sometimes with laugh-out-loud cosmetics on the one dead guy - won't give away more than that, but think ""Blue Man Group""), and the cheesy flying papers and books (a-la Postergeist) it really was a slight bit better than your average off-the-shelf (OTS) Blockbuster ""I really am trying to find a good horror diamond in the rough"" pick.  If you want one of those, try ""Session 9"", ""Dead Birds"", or maybe (to lesser degree) ""Ginger Snaps"" - (Ginger Snaps, while not scary, is at least interesting and clever at times). I recommend all those for anyone llooking for a surprise interesting horror movie that won't waste your time.I give them an A for effort in this (Ghost Watcher), what seems a slightly better than average college postgraduate film effort (though it was apparently produced by a professional film company). I do have to say, there were some moments of individuality in this one that lack so often in the others of this OTS horror genre.Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases.  So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for...",3,He's right...
