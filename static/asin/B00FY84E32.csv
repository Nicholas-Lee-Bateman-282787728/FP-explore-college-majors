If it wasn't for the ending I would give it a 5 star rating.The cast was likable enough and while it lacked on action (barely anything happens), it kept me entertained.

1673717,A391AS877NJKUB,B00FY84E32,"G. Smith ""Egghead""","[2, 3]","You know the plot already.  It's been done to death.  Regular folk - could be your or me - go with a film crew to a &#34;haunted&#34; location hoping to find real evidence of paranormal activity.  Of course, not only do they find it, but the activity turns out to be more powerful than anyone could have imagined.  The meta-plot, as I understand it, is actually deeper and a bit more unique.  The film-maker claims that many of the people we see on screen are not actors, but were duped into believing that they were on a paranormal research reality TV show.  Thus, many of the emotions and interactions we see between the people on screen are, in a highly edited and superficial way, genuine and reflect what goes on with real-life hauntings.  With this, the film has claimed some relatively uncharted territory in the horror film landscape as more of a psychological art-life project than a storied film.  Unfortunately, without actual development, flat land remains flat, and so this unwatchable movie fails as anything other than an experience for those who were involved.The film begins with an introduction to the location via a news reporter who talks to a psychic.  We meet the people, who I assume have all been told that they'll be on TV, as they're driving in a limo to the location.  Every one of them claims to be a skeptic, except that they actually do believe in spirits, and are merely looking for the proper evidence to support their beliefs (...some skeptics). The entire rest of the film is an utter mess.  These people walk around, talk over each other, argue, fight for no reason and are eventually scared witless by various staged pranks.  It would be great fun if I could tell what was happening, but without direction or even skilled editing, all I get is a bunch of scream that runs into itself like spilled watercolor.  This being a found-footage style film, we cannot count on the director framing any of the scenes in such a way that would tell a story, either.  The burden of putting a story together is on the viewer rather than the creator, and as anyone who has been bored before knows, maintaining that requires a good bit of mental energy.There's little atmosphere, no characters to like or dislike and the story is rambling and incoherent - I might as well just go to the bar and listen to drunks tell tall tales.
