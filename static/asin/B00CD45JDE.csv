New press releases spark new interest and also a lot of people might not be able to afford to buy the complete set at once!

1645974,A3OIH43KWWBNUP,B00CD45JDE,smuthdude,"[27, 28]","Bonanza's 6th season was the last to feature Pernell Roberts as Adam Cartwright.  Unhappy with a perceived decline in script quality, Roberts would leave in early 1965 (mid-season) to pursue other acting opportunities.  Because of this, just under half of the episodes featured in this collection are ""Adamless""; which tees up the ""three Cartwright era"" that would showcase Lorne Greene, Michael Landon & Dan Blocker exclusively, until David Canary joined the cast in the fall of 1967.This is also the season in which the original distributor, Republic Pictures, began dividing up seasons for syndication.  ""Lothario Larkin"", which was one of the ""Adamless"" 6th season episodes, was excluded from Bonanza's ""Classic 260"" syndication package that has aired on North American television from the late 1970's to date.  It remained out of syndication until it was included as part of the ""Lost Episodes"" package that began airing on the Family Channel back in 1988.  Inexplicably, it's the only pre-7th season episode excluded from that original package. The 8th, 9th, 10th & 11th season episodes were divided between ""Classic 360"" and ""Lost Episodes"" packages, so it will be exciting to see them all together again in their original running order in future Bonanza releases.In this set, we have a refreshing blast from the past.  I've never seen these episodes look so clean!  I grew up watching those washed out, grainy 16mm syndication prints on KTLA in Los Angeles. So seeing the color and audio restored to near-HD quality is a real treat; along with all the extras.
