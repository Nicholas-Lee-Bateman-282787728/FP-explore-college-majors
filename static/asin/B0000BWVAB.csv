Cool CG animation, thrilling story and brilliant characters, Pokemon Heroes is the best Pokemon movie ever! Although this fifth instalment is also the shortest in the films (1 hour and 11 minutes is no exception), I still like it! The story goes like this - It begins when two slick theives, Annie and Oakley, stole a book that tells them about the water city Alto Mare, the sibling Pokemon Latios &amp; Latias (said to have strong psychic abilities and the power to disguise themselves as humans) and the mystical jewel, the Soul Dew, said to have contain an awesome - and dangerous power, if it fell into the wrong hands. Fast forward to present day Alto Mare, where Ash and Misty compete in the annual water race competition, the Tour De Alto Mare. After the race (which Misty won), Ash finds a new interest, a mysterious girl (whom he doesn't know is Latias). After an encounter with Annie and Oakley, Ash and Pikachu follow human-disguised Latias to a secret garden, where he meets Latios, Bianca (the human form of Latias disguise) and Lorenzo, her grandfather.

The computer graphics were great and the music was beautiful, thankfully they kept the original Japanese soundtrack in, instead of the rather irritating english attempt.  The English opening and ending credit songs were just remixes of the songs from the Pokemon 3 soundtrack.  The characters were very well done and enjoyable, only problem is....not enought Jessie, James and Meowth!  They were harldy even in the film!  But the villans, Annie and Oakley, were very entertaining, funny and evil!!  Again, the computer graphics were amazing!!  A big improvement over Pokemon 4.  The scenery was absolutely gorgeous too!!  And if you look very closely at some of the bricks and panels on the bridges and homes, you can see drawings of MewTwo, Lugia, Entei, and Celebi!  The animation was very good, only problem was sometimes the picture looked a little greenish and not as sharp and clear as the previous movies.  The dvd also has some nice extras, such as location scouting in Venice, a quiz on the movie, and the animation stages that were used for the computerized sequences.  The 2 main pokemon, Latias and Latios, were very well animated and so cute!!  This is one of the best Pokemon made so far!

770997,A2SAA88HCSS7RB,B0000BWVAB,Jack,"[5, 5]","Pokemon has always been one of my favorite animes, the reason is because it gives the audience an upbeat and esthusiastic sensation that's hard to forget. Some people may find the TV series a bit boring, but I can guarantee you, Pokemon's 5th movie, Pokemon Heroes, is no where close to boredom since 80% of the time is filled with suspense and action.The movie does not emphasize on the &quot;one person who saves all&quot; perspective, which means Ash, to my surprise, does not play the major role here; his significance in this movie is far less than that of Latias and Latios, the two legendary guardians that protect the city that looks almost identical to Venice. Unlike Pokemon 2000, Ash does not takes his enemies out with Pikachu, his courage and bravery in this movie cannot prevent the destruction of the city. This reflects that the word &quot;heroes&quot; in Pokemon Heroes does not refer to Ash and his gang, rather, it focuses on Latias and Latios' sacrificial actions (especially Latios).Like all other Pokemon movies, the graphics are beautifully drawn and rendered. When Ash is running away with Latias in street alleys near the beginning of the movie, the first person view of the scenary mixed with 3D effect is truly breathtaking! It is comparable to Miyazaki's Spirited Away's 3D rendering, and to some degree, better than that of Spirited Away's.The background musics give the audience a sensation of Venice's (though the city is not Venice in the movie), and musics can be heard most of the time throughout the anime, which do not create boredom because they match up with the atmosphere perfectly.Pokemon Heroes is truly an amazing film, anyone who loves Pokemon animes should watch it, and anyone who's bored of the protagonist saving the entire world should watch this for a change, it will not give you disappointment!",5,great movie!,1078531200,"03 6, 2004",2004,1846,"['Pokemon', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'animes', 'reason', 'audience', 'upbeat', 'esthusiastic', 'sensation', 'hard', 'forget', 'people', 'may', 'find', 'TV', 'series', 'bit', 'boring', 'can', 'guarantee', 'Pokemon', '5th', 'movie', 'Pokemon', 'Heroes', 'where', 'close', 'boredom', '80', '%', 'time', 'filled', 'suspense', 'action.The', 'movie', 'not', 'emphasize', 'quot', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'quot', 'perspective', 'Ash', 'surprise', 'not', 'play', 'major', 'role', 'here', 'significance', 'movie', 'far', 'less', 'Latias', 'Latios', 'two', 'legendary', 'guardians', 'protect', 'city', 'almost', 'identical', 'Venice', 'Pokemon', '2000', 'Ash', 'not', 'enemies', 'out', 'Pikachu', 'courage', 'bravery', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'prevent', 'destruction', 'city', 'word', 'quot', 'heroes', 'quot', 'Pokemon', 'Heroes', 'not', 'refer', 'Ash', 'gang', 'rather', 'Latias', 'Latios', 'sacrificial', 'actions', 'especially', 'Latios', 'other', 'Pokemon', 'movies', 'graphics', 'are', 'beautifully', 'drawn', 'rendered', 'When', 'Ash', 'running', 'away', 'Latias', 'street', 'alleys', 'beginning', 'movie', 'first', 'person', 'view', 'scenary', 'mixed', '3D', 'effect', 'truly', 'breathtaking', 'comparable', 'Miyazaki', 'Spirited', 'Away', '3D', 'rendering', 'degree', 'better', 'Spirited', ""Away's.The"", 'background', 'musics', 'give', 'audience', 'sensation', 'Venice', 'city', 'not', 'Venice', 'movie', 'musics', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'most', 'time', 'anime', 'do', 'not', 'create', 'boredom', 'match', 'up', 'atmosphere', 'perfectly.Pokemon', 'Heroes', 'truly', 'amazing', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'Pokemon', 'animes', 'should', 'watch', 'anyone', 'who', 'bored', 'protagonist', 'saving', 'entire', 'world', 'should', 'watch', 'change', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'disappointment']",N/A
770998,AY5XWJE0LEYB8,B0000BWVAB,jasmine garcia,"[0, 0]","Along the many mountainous areas of Johto, a train runs from the big city to the big country. On one of the cars are the Pichu twins. The train came out of a tunnel recently, blowing the soot it made into their faces. They look at each other and laugh at how they look. Up ahead is a mail bag for trains to catch, but a Skarmory that rested on it soon takes off. The bag spins around and the Pichus are caught and smacked right off the train, being shot off into the forests. A Wynaut is sitting in a tree, enjoying the fruit when the Pichus fall on the branch and flings them all across the area. Mean while, Pikachu, Togepi, Totodile, Cyndaquil, Corsola, and Psyduck all enjoy a bit of time in the forest, when all of a sudden Pichu, then Pichu, and Wynaut fall upon Psyduck. Pikachu goes checks it out and notices it's the same Pichus from before and they dance about for a moment before Wynaut makes a scene.Everyone greets him and soon they go off to finding some food. They go hop around some rocks then look around some more before finding a bunch of grape trees (First berry trees.... now grape trees? Looks like everything grows on trees) and they eat. Totodile apparently has a hard time with one bunch but slips out, splatting on Cyndaquil.  Pichu finds a bunch just low enough, but it scuttles when he tries to grab it. He tries to get it again, but the grape just keeps moving away. Finally they figure out its a Sudowoodo. The the Pichus try to nab the grapes but the Sudowoodo wins at the grip. The Sudowoodo so gets off and Wynaut gets into a little arguement, but the Sudowoodo walks off. Everyone is soon at a pond, taking a drink. Just around the pond are two stair-like rapids, and Totodile soon comes riding down on them, making a big splash on the Pichu brothers.They laugh and splash at Totodile for a moment then Totodile WaterGuns Pichu up on of the rapids which he returns down with shock but soon laughs as he gets down. Totodile then Water Guns the other Pichu and he comes down with the same expression. Everyone finds this fun and soon wants to try it out. Togepi, Psyduck and Corsola all go up and they get pushed up to the top of the falls and comes back down all enjoying themselves. Meanwhile, Meowth and Wobbuffet hike along the mountains of the area, again on some random journey to no-where. Meowth starts to sulk and then all of a sudden, they go a little too fast and runs into Meowth, tripping and rolling down the hill. In the evening, everyone comes by a mountain side facing the sun.A few of them start to play around with their shadows until Pikachu tries to act like a big monster with his. Everyone laughs playfully, Pikachu a little embarrased his scare didn't quite work. Later that night everyone decides to settle in the forest. Cyndaquil starts up a fire and and everyone settles down and relaxes. Something comes by Pichu however and makes a spooky laughing sound. He looks back, there was nothing... maybe something was there? He walks off into the forest looking around along with Wynaut. The laughing sounds go on and soon Duskull appears, coming right at them! Pichu runs behind Wynaut scared but something's wrong. It looks like Wynaut and Duskull are friends! They start to talk for a while then Pichu gets an idea. Back at the campfire, Yowamaru taps on the other Pichu's shoulder with a stick, causing him to look around. He walks into the forest a bit, scared about something there. Yowamaru taps on Pichu's shoulder, but when he looked back, Yowamaru dissapeared, appearing behind him with a laugh. This happens a few more times until Yowamaru suddenly shows up and it scares Pichu silly.This causes everyone else to look over at Pichu, and soon run around back to the campsite with Yowamaru chasing after him. Soon Pichu and Wynaut appear and everyone laughs. The Yowamaru shakes Pichu and Wynaut's hands before going off. It starts to rain, everyone wondering how they'll seek cover. Soon a Volbeat comes flying by, carrying a leaf as an umbrella. He flies to them and greets them. Looks like he knows a place where they could sleep for the night. Everyone follows him and goes through some high grass, everyone but Totodile in the back has a leaf. Poor Cyndaquil... Totodile's dancing is slapping mud all over him.They eventually get to an old water-mill building that looks like it's for grinding wheat into flour. They head inside for a moment, looks like everything's okay to sleep in. Meowth an Wobbuffet walk aorund for a while in the rain before Yowarmaru tries his scare on them. They get scared and run super fast straight before smacking themselves in the water-mill. They go in and look inside for a while. Meanwhile, everyone else is sleeping on the second floor. While they look around, Meowth trips and hits a switch that soon turns on the place, everything starting to move, all the lights get turned on.Everyone gets up, all trying to get away from anything moving. Psyduck gets stuck running on a wheel for the moment, keeping him occupied. Meawhile Wynaught gets stuck in a table for a grinder, the grinder coming close. Pikachu came in a got him out before the grinder touched down. Soon everything becomes a mess. Totodile trying to get a wheel stable sends it rolling down the hallway with him on it, the wheel was headed straight for Pichu and others! He manages to grab a rope however which lower a staircase and the wheel simple goes up.Wynaut on the other hand helps out the other Pichu on a elevator contraption, but soon gets caught in it himself as he goes downwards. On the floor below, Wynaut runs into Wobbuffet. Both do some talking back and forth, Meowth a little confused. (Funny scene, Wobbuffet and Wynaut exachnage ""Sonano!"" ""Sonansu"" and so on) After a bit, Wynaut went back up, apparently now the things going on get so rough that soon a barrel that Volbeat was holding start fell from the second floor down. Meowth and Wobbuffet get catapulted up into the sky, landing on the stream that soon gets them spun out by the water-wheel. Now to turn this contraption off. Pikachu and Volbeat get to the switch and soon push it.They successfully shut off the machine, everything stopping, everything going back to where it was originally. Soon everyone relaxes and decides to take their long-wanted sleep. The next morning, everyone goes outside, it's yet another beautiful day. Everyone washes their faces, one of the Pichus needing help. Volbeat departs from the pack, while the group themselves find the train the Pichus were taking. Meowth and Wobbuffet settle down for a breakfast, a single cookie. Then the Skarmory from before swoops down and takes it, both of them grabbing on with fury.They reach the top of the hill, seeing the train at a station. Soon then everybody slides down on leaves as they go high-speed down the hill. When they get to the bottom, there's a slight bump, when they get over that, they start running. But the train's already moving! Everyone runs fast to the caboose, but only one Pichu manages to get on. The train's already too fast for them, so they find a push car. (Those cars where you have to push down and pull up to move) They can't move the car, so Wynaut calls out and soon a whole bunch of Wynauts come out. Together, everyone manages to push the the car foward. They catch up to the train at first, but it the train moves faster than they could. With no other option. Cyndaquil moves up to the back and unleashes a flamethrower on the ground which boosts the car fast enough to catchup with the train. Psyduck is soon knocked off the car, right into a switch gate after the train passed it!The car makes a sharp turn but luckily it's heading right to a bridge over the train. Phanpy picks up Pichu and as soon as they hit the bridge, Phanpy tosses Pichu straight for the train. As for the car, it ran right into a pile of wood, sending everyone high up. Pichu on the other hand isn't going to make it to the train, so in mid-air, Totodile uses a Water Gun to push Pichu far enough to the train. Everyone falls onto some hay on a cliff, and Pichu lands on the caboose. The Pichus waves goodbye, as well as everyone else. As for Meowth and Wobbuffet? Well they were let go just above that train. They soon landed on the coal car of the train.",5,a camping-good time!,1343174400,"07 25, 2012",2012,8283,"['many', 'mountainous', 'areas', 'Johto', 'train', 'big', 'city', 'big', 'country', 'one',

770999,A1T4KKG4E5W5VE,B0000BWVAB,"J. P. Suhr ""Slagar""","[4, 6]",I saw this movie last year.  Ash Misty and Brock are back.  The are in France.  Unlike the other Pokemon movies Heroes and Jirachi do not start with Pokemon battles.Unlike in the other movies the two main pokemon do not have and dialogue.  The bad things about this movie is is lacks some of the tense action that the previous ones had.  Another major draw back is the main members of Team Rocket Jesse James and Mewoth have now interaction with any body but eahcv other.  Making the small portion of the movie they are in ver dull and boring.The giant tidal wave at the end I thought was cool.  Another thing is one of the two pokemon either Latios or Latias has the power to shift into human from.Remind me of the shape shift T-1000 in terminator 2.  Another disadvatange and misty who is in every Movie but Jirachi and Brook who is in ever Move except Pokemon 2Tthosuands.  Have a slight smaller ruller in this one than the did in the previous ones.Like all the other pokemon movies the complete main Theme song for it  is played.  The theme song is different at the binging of each moving depend on which season it is taking place for.To be honest I think the change of theme song for each new season is stupid.  I makes it hard for me to  rememeber the lyrics.  I have lyric memorized to the first  season 2 the abriged  version used on  Television.We meet to new  members of team rocket.  To girls called  anne and Okly.  There and okay duo.  There not as smart and trecherous as Jessiea and James are.This and  Jirchia should be fine if you are 7 or older. The other movies I think are to intense for people under 11.The only other bad thing  about this is one of the main Pokemon ends up die which I did not think was appropirate because Pokemon never died in the movies except for Celbi.,3,Good movie bad ending,1110326400,"03 9, 2005",2005,1796,"['saw', 'movie', 'last', 'year', 'Ash', 'Misty', 'Brock', 'are', 'back', 'are', 'France', 'other', 'Pokemon', 'movies', 'Heroes', 'Jirachi', 'do', 'not', 'start', 'Pokemon', 'battles.Unlike', 'other', 'movies', 'two', 'main', 'pokemon', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'dialogue', 'bad', 'things', 'movie', 'lacks', 'tense', 'action', 'previous', 'ones', 'had', 'major', 'draw', 'back', 'main', 'members', 'Team', 'Rocket', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Mewoth', 'have', 'now', 'interaction', 'body', 'other', 'Making', 'small', 'portion', 'movie', 'are', 'ver', 'dull', 'boring.The', 'giant', 'tidal', 'wave', 'end', 'thought', 'was', 'cool', 'thing', 'one', 'two', 'pokemon', 'Latios', 'Latias', 'power', 'shift', 'human', 'shape', 'shift', 'T-1000', 'terminator', '2', 'disadvatange', 'misty', 'who', 'Movie', 'Jirachi', 'Brook', 'who', 'ever', 'Move', 'Pokemon', '2Tthosuands', 'Have', 'slight', 'smaller', 'ruller', 'one', 'did', 'previous', 'other', 'pokemon', 'movies', 'complete', 'main', 'Theme', 'song', 'played', 'theme', 'song', 'different', 'binging', 'moving', 'depend', 'season', 'taking', 'place', 'for.To', 'be', 'honest', 'think', 'change', 'theme', 'song', 'new', 'season', 'stupid', 'hard', 'rememeber', 'lyrics', 'have', 'lyric', 'memorized', 'first', 'season', '2', 'abriged', 'version', 'used', 'Television.We', 'meet', 'new', 'members', 'team', 'rocket', 'girls', 'called', 'anne', 'Okly', 'okay', 'duo', 'not', 'smart', 'trecherous', 'Jessiea', 'James', 'are.This', 'Jirchia', 'should', 'be', 'fine', 'are', '7', 'older', 'other', 'movies', 'think', 'are', 'intense', 'people', '11.The', 'only', 'other', 'bad', 'thing', 'one', 'main', 'Pokemon', 'up', 'die', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'was', 'appropirate', 'Pokemon', 'never', 'died', 'movies', 'Celbi']",N/A

771001,A1EEG7YJIYN60B,B0000BWVAB,Lesley Aeschliman,"[0, 1]","Pokemon Heroes: Latios and Latias is the fifth film released for Pokemon.  The film clocks in at 71 minutes, and it's the right length for the story being told in the film.  The pacing of the film is perfect; as a viewer, I didn't feel it was taking too long or that it was going too quickly.  Like the other Pokemon films, an attempt was made to combine computer graphics with the 2D animation; unfortunately, just like in the other films, the computer animation stood out too much from the 2D animation and called too much attention to itself.On this disc, the short ""Camp Pikachu,"" which was shown before the film in Japanese theaters, is included as one of the special features.  In this short, the Pichu brothers fall off of the train they're riding on top of.  They run into Pikachu, Cyndaquil, Totodile, Phanpy, Corsola, Togepi, Psyduck, and Wynaut.  They work together to try to get the Pichu brothers to the train station to catch another train.  Meowth and Wobbuffet also make a cameo appearance.Another special feature is ""Location Scouting in Venice.""  This runs for about two minutes, and it shows the director and some of the crew scouting out locations in Venice.  This is intercut with footage from the actual film that match what the director and crew are seeing in the city.  ""Animation Stages"" includes six sequences.  By using the angle button, you can see the 2D elements, the 3D elements, and the final version of the sequence.""The Characters of Pokemon Heroes"" includes six Pokemon: Kabutops, Aerodactyl, Ariados, Espeon, Latias, and Latios.  For each Pokemon, there are several still images of the Pokemon, along with writeups for them (describing their personality and other traits, as well as information on its species, type, height, weight, ability, and evolution).The ""Pokemon Heroes Trivia Game"" has you use the remote to select the answers for seven questions, and the seven questions are chosen randomly.  If you get the question right, you see a clip of the film that is connected to the question.  If you get a question wrong, the word ""WRONG"" appears on the screen, and the male voice over tells you that you got the answer wrong.  Personally, the male voice over actor (who explains how to play the game, reads the questions out, tells you if you're wrong, and tells you how you do at the end) sounds rather bored when he's delivering his lines.Pokemon Heroes is a good film.  While this DVD release is better than the DVD releases for some of the earlier Pokemon films, I think the special features could have been a little better.  If you're a fan of Pokemon, you should have this film in your collection.",3,"A good film, but wish the special features were better",1255996800,"10 20, 2009",2009,2643,"['Pokemon', 'Heroes', 'Latios', 'Latias', 'fifth', 'film', 'released', 'Pokemon', 'film', 'clocks', '71', 'minutes', 'right', 'length', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'film', 'pacing', 'film', 'perfect', 'viewer', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'taking', 'too', 'long', 'was', 'going', 'too', 'quickly', 'other', 'Pokemon', 'films', 'attempt', 'was', 'made', 'combine', 'computer', 'graphics', '2D', 'animation', 'unfortunately', 'just', 'other', 'films', 'computer', 'animation', 'stood', 'out', 'too', 'much', '2D', 'animation', 'called', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'itself.On', 'disc', 'short', 'Camp', 'Pikachu', 'was', 'shown', 'film', 'Japanese', 'theaters', 'included', 'one', 'special', 'features', 'short', 'Pichu', 'brothers', 'fall', 'train', ""'re"", 'riding', 'top', 'run', 'Pikachu', 'Cyndaquil', 'Totodile', 'Phanpy', 'Corsola', 'Togepi', 'Psyduck', 'Wynaut', 'work', 'together', 'try', 'get', 'Pichu', 'brothers', 'train', 'station', 'catch', 'train', 'Meowth', 'Wobbuffet', 'also', 'make', 'cameo', 'appearance.Another', 'special', 'feature', 'Location', 'Scouting', 'Venice', 'two', 'minutes', 'director', 'crew', 'scouting', 'out', 'locations', 'Venice', 'intercut', 'footage', 'actual', 'film', 'what', 'director', 'crew', 'are', 'seeing', 'city', 'Animation', 'Stages', 'six', 'sequences', 'using', 'angle', 'button', 'can', 'see', '2D', 'elements', '3D', 'elements', 'final', 'version', 'sequence', 'Characters', 'Pokemon', 'Heroes', 'six', 'Pokemon', 'Kabutops', 'Aerodactyl', 'Ariados', 'Espeon', 'Latias', 'Latios', 'Pokemon', 'are', 'several', 'still', 'images', 'Pokemon', 'writeups', 'describing', 'personality', 'other', 'traits', 'as', 'well', 'information', 'species', 'type', 'height', 'weight', 'ability', 'evolution', 'Pokemon', 'Heroes', 'Trivia', 'Game', 'use', 'remote', 'select', 'answers', 'seven', 'questions', 'seven', 'questions', 'are', 'chosen', 'randomly', 'get', 'question', 'right', 'see', 'clip', 'film', 'connected', 'question', 'get', 'question', 'wrong', 'word', 'WRONG', 'screen', 'male', 'voice', 'tells', 'got', 'answer', 'wrong', 'Personally', 'male', 'voice', 'actor', 'who', 'how', 'play', 'game', 'questions', 'out', 'tells', ""'re"", 'wrong', 'tells', 'how', 'do', 'end', 'rather', 'bored', 'when', 'delivering', 'lines.Pokemon', 'Heroes', 'good', 'film', 'DVD', 'release', 'better', 'DVD', 'releases', 'earlier', 'Pokemon', 'films', 'think', 'special', 'features', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'better', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Pokemon', 'should', 'have', 'film', 'collection']",N/A

771006,A1YSI93GVIVPPT,B0000BWVAB,Robert Fernandez,"[37, 38]","I just saw this a few hours ago, and I must say that it was spectacular. Pokemon Heroes: Latias and Latios begins with a couple of attractive master thieves stealing a book from some sort of library, and in James Bond fashion, they leap through the window, swing down a grappling hook's rope, jump in their sweet-looking car, and hit the road at high speeds. But the cool part came when they drove off the side of a large cliff and as they plummeted downwards, their car transforms(very detailed, but quickly) into a flying machine as they zoom off into the night sky. The movie has tons of these sort of slick action scenes, which is what moves the movie forward. The story is okay, for a Pokemon movie, and isn't too predictable. Ash and Co. arrive at a beautiful city called AltoMare(which resembles Venice, complete with water canals and gondolas). After participating in a water race, Ash runs into a strange girl, and the thieves who want to kidnap her for some reason, which leads to what is the first of many chase scenes in the movie.The animation is far more advanced than the previous movies, with LOTS of computer generated imagery, and some SFX shots that are Matrix-esque. This movie is a very nice piece of eye-candy indeed(There's a scene where a flood starts to brew from afar, which sent a chill up my back). The traditional hand-drawn animation is good too, though there are many times where the characters seem to be drawn with black outlines that are a little too big. Thankfully Miramax left in the original orchestrated music, which is beautiful, mixing traditional anime orchestral pieces with Italian music. Heck, they even left in a JAPANESE song during a certain part of the movie! The movie begins with the same 'World of Pokemon' segment seen in many other places, and again they skip the mini-movie which will probably be on the DVD. Anyways, the voice acting is okay, and they didn't really change much of the movie in this English version. The opening and ending sequences has some american songs though, but they're okay. The only gripe I had was with Latias and Latios' voices; they're kinda annoying, and not what I expected.Either way, if you're a Pokemon fan, you should definitely find a theater that's playing this film and see this movie. The semi-large audience at the screening actually clapped at the film's finale, and they even stayed for the end credits!(Which has a cameo appearance of a certain Pokemon collector from the second Pokemon film) It's one of the best, and possibly the most satisfying Pokemon movie made. Besides, the movie's ending is really cute. ;)",5,Possibly the best Pokemon movie ever dubbed,1053129600,"05 17, 2003",2003,2612,"['just', 'saw', 'few', 'hours', 'ago', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'spectacular', 'Pokemon', 'Heroes', 'Latias', 'Latios', 'couple', 'attractive', 'master', 'thieves', 'stealing', 'book', 'sort', 'library', 'James', 'Bond', 'fashion', 'leap', 'window', 'swing', 'down', 'grappling', 'hook', 'rope', 'jump', 'sweet-looking', 'car', 'hit', 'road', 'high', 'speeds', 'cool', 'part', 'came', 'when', 'drove', 'off', 'side', 'large', 'cliff', 'plummeted', 'downwards', 'car', 'transforms', 'very', 'detailed', 'quickly', 'flying', 'machine', 'zoom', 'night', 'sky', 'movie', 'tons', 'sort', 'slick', 'action', 'scenes', 'what', 'movie', 'forward', 'story', 'okay', 'Pokemon', 'movie', ""n't"", 'too', 'predictable', 'Ash', 'Co.', 'arrive', 'beautiful', 'city', 'called', 'AltoMare', 'Venice', 'complete', 'water', 'canals', 'gondolas', 'participating', 'water', 'race', 'Ash', 'strange', 'girl', 'thieves', 'who', 'want', 'kidnap', 'reason', 'what', 'first', 'many', 'chase', 'scenes', 'movie.The', 'animation', 'far', 'more', 'advanced', 'previous', 'movies', 'LOTS', 'computer', 'generated', 'imagery', 'SFX', 'shots', 'are', 'Matrix-esque', 'movie', 'very', 'nice', 'piece', 'eye-candy', 'indeed', 'scene', 'where', 'flood', 'brew', 'afar', 'sent', 'chill', 'up', 'back', 'traditional', 'hand-drawn', 'animation', 'good', 'too', 'are', 'many', 'times', 'where', 'characters', 'seem', 'be', 'drawn', 'black', 'outlines', 'are', 'little', 'too', 'big', 'Thankfully', 'Miramax', 'left', 'original', 'orchestrated', 'music', 'beautiful', 'mixing', 'traditional', 'anime', 'orchestral', 'pieces', 'Italian', 'music', 'Heck', 'even', 'left', 'JAPANESE', 'song', 'certain', 'part', 'movie', 'movie', 'same', ""'World"", 'Pokemon', 'segment', 'seen', 'many', 'other', 'places', 'again', 'skip', 'mini-movie', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'DVD', 'Anyways', 'voice', 'acting', 'okay', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'change', 'much', 'movie', 'English', 'version', 'opening', 'ending', 'sequences', 'american', 'songs', ""'re"", 'okay', 'only', 'gripe', 'had', 'was', 'Latias', 'Latios', 'voices', ""'re"", 'kinda', 'annoying', 'not', 'what', 'expected.Either', 'way', ""'re"", 'Pokemon', 'fan', 'should', 'definitely', 'find', 'theater', 'playing', 'film', 'see', 'movie', 'semi-large', 'audience', 'screening', 'actually', 'clapped', 'film', 'finale', 'even', 'stayed', 'end', 'Which', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'certain', 'Pokemon', 'collector', 'second', 'Pokemon', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'possibly', 'most', 'satisfying', 'Pokemon', 'movie', 'made', 'Besides', 'movie', 'ending', 'really', 'cute']",N/A
