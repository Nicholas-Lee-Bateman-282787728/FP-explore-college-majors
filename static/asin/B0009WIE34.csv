Not all of the jokes work (do they ever?), but I was glad to see that despite the ""Hollywood"" bent of season four (where Larry gets help from celebs such as Mel Brooks, Ben Stiller, and David Schwimmer) Larry remains Larry. I mean, what other comedian would make a reference to the ""Great Compromiser"" Henry Clay? A bundle of contradictions, Larry is at once withdrawn and confrontational, overly conscientious yet also incredibly insensitive. Although I can't buy that any woman, let alone Larry's long suffering wife, would permit her husband a one-time fling as a 10th anniversary present, the running gag pays off because it sets up a series of encounters where Larry shows how inept he is at wooing women (remember, in season two he said he could talk anyone into anything, except getting women to sleep with him). And though I had doubts about whether the Producers plot would work, it does. Larry offends not one but two of his Producers co-stars as well as countless others along the way. There's a twist in the last episode that took me by surprise, and it was clever too. Sometimes the show strains too hard to find confrontations in everyday events. For example, I've never encountered a stewardess as rude as the one Larry comes across on his flight to New York. Nor would a black guy in real life walking past Larry's car instantly accuse Larry of racism just because he turned on his car alarm. But if some of the gags are forced, season four is as funny as the others. Larry might get more abrasive with each season, but he is no less amusing. Season four, as with the others, stands up to repeat viewing. And we get a one hour final episode that is much funnier than the last episode of a certain other Larry David sitcom. The best entry here involves Larry's efforts to avoid the rush hour crowd by picking up a hooker so her can use the much faster carpool lane. That episode might contain the most awkward, not to mention funny, drug deal in TV history.",4,Another Solid Season of Curb,1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,2061,"['liked', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'Curb', 'probably', 'will', 'like', 'fourth', 'as', 'well', 'Not', 'jokes', 'work', 'do', 'ever', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'Hollywood', 'bent', 'season', 'four', 'where', 'Larry', 'help', 'celebs', 'such', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'Larry', 'Larry', 'mean', 'what', 'other', 'comedian', 'would', 'make', 'reference', 'Great', 'Compromiser', 'Henry', 'Clay', 'A', 'bundle', 'contradictions', 'Larry', 'once', 'withdrawn', 'confrontational', 'overly', 'conscientious', 'yet', 'also', 'incredibly', 'insensitive', 'ca', ""n't"", 'buy', 'woman', 'let', 'alone', 'Larry', 'long', 'suffering', 'wife', 'would', 'permit', 'husband', 'one-time', 'fling', '10th', 'anniversary', 'present', 'running', 'gag', 'pays', 'up', 'series', 'encounters', 'where', 'Larry', 'how', 'inept', 'wooing', 'women', 'remember', 'season', 'two', 'said', 'could', 'talk', 'anyone', 'anything', 'getting', 'women', 'sleep', 'had', 'doubts', 'Producers', 'plot', 'would', 'work', 'Larry', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'Producers', 'co-stars', 'as', 'well', 'countless', 'others', 'way', 'twist', 'last', 'episode', 'took', 'surprise', 'was', 'clever', 'too', 'show', 'too', 'hard', 'find', 'confrontations', 'everyday', 'events', 'example', ""'ve"", 'never', 'encountered', 'stewardess', 'as', 'rude', 'one', 'Larry', 'flight', 'New', 'York', 'Nor', 'would', 'black', 'guy', 'real', 'life', 'walking', 'past', 'Larry', 'car', 'instantly', 'Larry', 'racism', 'just', 'turned', 'car', 'alarm', 'gags', 'are', 'forced', 'season', 'four', 'as', 'funny', 'others', 'Larry', 'might', 'get', 'more', 'abrasive', 'season', 'less', 'amusing', 'Season', 'four', 'others', 'up', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'get', 'one', 'hour', 'final', 'episode', 'much', 'funnier', 'last', 'episode', 'certain', 'other', 'Larry', 'David', 'sitcom', 'best', 'entry', 'here', 'Larry', 'efforts', 'avoid', 'rush', 'hour', 'crowd', 'picking', 'up', 'hooker', 'can', 'use', 'much', 'faster', 'carpool', 'lane', 'episode', 'might', 'contain', 'most', 'awkward', 'not', 'mention', 'funny', 'drug', 'deal', 'TV', 'history']",Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 4

Hopefully this is not his version of ""Jumping the Shark"". What made this show's chemistry so good is that it was low key, not showy and that he was rough around the edges which got him in trouble with fake Hollywood people - This chemistry is changing for the worst. Another thing I see that is happening is he's getting more stars on his show and it looks like younger stars to appeal to the 20 and 30 year olds.I HOPE THIS IS NOT TRUE but I have a feeling this show might be running out of steam.

This season there are multiple plots which run through some or all of the season.  The season long stories include Larry joining a Broadway production of ""The Producers"", and the David's 10 year wedding anniversary and the gift that Cheryl promised him before they ever were married.  There are also smaller plots, such as getting kicked out of their country club and trying to join a new one, and insulting David Schwimmer's father.Each show has its own plot as well, which have Larry disrupting Ben Stiller's birthday party, setting up a blind man on a blind date, paying a hooker to ride in his car so that he can use the car pool lane, and much much more.

914737,AEGLLY9CXWXX3,B0009WIE34,"Halifax Student Account ""a-beautiful-idea""","[0, 0]","This season is as strong as the last few and shows the calibre of Larry Davids amygdilla. Genius comedy is rare, what with the rubbish coming out the udders of mass culture, and all that, but thankfully, Curb Your Enthusiasm ranks with the brightest telly can offer. Larry David is an absolute genius like Ricky Gervais, that Heidegger bloke and Woody Allen.I love his writing and rank Curb with The Office and Cheers as one of funniest shows ever. My girlfriend and I can't get enough of Larry David, and even though he is 70 and should be taking it easy, he is still doing the do, like shouting at poor people and young girls, but in a funny way. (I hope that made sense). I just had a funny vision of Hank Moody, from Californication, playing Larrys character...  Let's write him a letter.What I mean is, Larry David's character is constantly harassed and bothered by poor people, that is, Hollywood's zero's who work in shopping malls and restaurants, and who dare to appear in front of Larry David's face; grrr!! Cue hilarious adventures. Hank Moody has similar adventures and both shows are set in Hollywood and its just as hilarious, which is the point. Many reviewers are offended by Larry Davids character, but they are really missing the point.A slight problemo. When Larry David's character is forced to sneer in an aloof but funny manner at a young nurse, it goes deeper than an old man sneering aloof because, I'm not being ageist (is that even a word), but the very old should be meditating, or whatever Hollywood types are in to these days; well its Larry so we can let him off! Hank Moody would be funnier mind, hence my Hank Moody ref.. Fortune favours the old tho.. This is the magic of Curb Your Enthusiasm. If you wanna get depressed, this aint the place to be. Its funnier that Notes from Underground you see (that didn't make sense too.. Oops!)So we see Larry David arguing with a waiter over why he should pay a tip, this would be funny if it wasn't for Larry David's own admission that he is indeed a millionaire, and so the joke hurt my sides as advertised. Larry David as a persecuted victim of those horrid Murlocks from H.G. Wells: The Time Machine, is a funny turn of events. Funnier still, Larry David hilariously shouts down aggressive female nurses who display annoying behaviour, like attending sick cues with those annoying sick people and LArry gets the once in a lifetime opportunity to humiliate a ridiculous shoe salesman (you have to see it for yourself). Larry David must be completely bonkers if he believes that laughing at workers is a source of insight; but it works, trust me, and this is why the man is a genius. Only in Hollywood can this be funny. We plebes will never get the chance to insult people like Larry David does and still be allowed in the community and this is why watching Larry David do it for us is so much fun. Those working class people are sooo 20th century and they deserve Larrys fire and brimstone. What's his next trick, bringing back sterilisation for the poor?Its the originality that I like. Larry David as a sneeringly repressed Hollywood writer, who sees himself as a crucified Outsider, with a dumb wife, young enough to be his victim, and a mansion with a high fence, is great. Larry doesn't just hate the poor, as he condemns the mind-set of the self regarding moneyed comrades he is forced to toil with, on a day to day basis. Give him an axe and Curb Your Enthusiasm is even funnier that American Psycho! Sorry to all the Ellis fans out there.Curb Your Enthusiasm is  a frikin masterpiece and Larry David is a great writer. Though you could argue that he only writes for millionaires and for those who believe that millionairehood is a mere few generations away. If you find shouting at the plebs and condemning their taste in shoes hilarious and if you yearn for Victorian values, but in a funny way, then you will love this. I loved it too, but I did feel guilty for doing so, so I'll let myself off!Curb Your Enthusiasm will go down in the annals of rib ticklers that reached the very heights of absurdist masterpieces.

There is actually a subtle progression to the show.  Each episode contains both ""self-contained"" stories, and ongoing issues that develop from show to show, and sometimes from season to season.But I'm assuming that if you're looking at Season 4, you're already interested in or familiar with CYE.  Season 4 is a laugh-riot.  I think the season now has the perfect blend of Larry David, the unfortunate victim of circumstance and Larry David, the jerk who brings bad things on himself.On one hand, Larry tries to be a nice guy.  He always seems to enjoy the company of children, for example...in a genuine way.  He'll sit down with them and play their games and talk to them like they're actually interesting.  To him, there's no one who isn't worth talking with and trying to be friendly with.  This is an admirable trait...which always gets him in trouble.  On the other hand, Larry never knows when to quit.  He'll start on a subject (for example, he begins to suggesting possible ""oriental-sounding"" names to a secretary who is getting ready to adopt a child), and his riff becomes more and more inappropriate and the signals from the woman become easier and easier to notice, but he blithely rambles on...making an enemy whose disgust WILL come back to bite him.Often, Larry David is categorized as a misanthrope.  To me that's far too easy.  What I like about him is that he can go from charming and amusing and genuinely concerned about something (his interactions with his wife, for example) to an overbearing, overopinionated jerk in about two seconds flat.  We see him crossing the line, but he never sees it himself.  He thinks his complaints or questions are perfectly reasonable. (There's a great scene where he is waiting in a doctor's exam room for the Dr. to appear...so he uses the phone in the room.  Doctor [brilliantly under-played by Phillip Baker Hall] explains that the phone is not for a patient's use.  David just keeps insisting on knowing why.  He tries at one point to restrain himself...but he just can't help it...he's obsessed with getting an explanation!).The big story of the season is Larry being hired by Mel Brooks to take the lead in THE PRODUCERS on Broadway.  It's a bit of a stretch to believe Mel would make such a choice, but if you buy it...you're in for a real treat!  Ben Stiller appears in several early episodes and is very funny doing his ""slow-burn"" schtick.  The show has always been great for letting its guest-stars playing themselves turn their whole images upside-down.It's unfortunate that a typical CYE season only has 10 episodes...but heck, each one packs the laughs of 3 or 4 typical sitcoms into it, so from an entertainment standpoint, you can't beat this show.  Every episode makes me laugh out-loud many, many times.By the way, in case you don't know...these shows ARE NOT FOR KIDS!!!  They contain very frank (and funny) language and situations.

Most of the season's episodes center on Larry David's effort (or lack thereof) to master the role of Max Bialystock, one the two principal characters in The Producers.  His constants struggles with the rehearsals and his fellow cast and crew members are truly hilarious. As usual, Larry manages to somehow insult everyone in his path, and seems to lose little sleep over it.  In my opinion, the season's two signature episodes are The Survivor and Opening Night.

I used a very unusual phonetic spelling and a very loosely coded slang that I figured hard-core viewers of the show would understand.  Well, I had ladies and gentleman alike explain that the reviews and the language that made them up were too ""difficult.""So I've decided to drop the comedy and play it straight in the review.  Unlike the preposterously overrated ""Seinfeld,"" this show by Larry David strikes a chord that resonates much deeper than nonsense such as a soup-nazi (which is one of the weaker socio-political aspects of ""Seinfeld"" - a total disrespect for historical events that need not be trivialized through 'jokes').  Larry David does, in fact, portray a stereotypical fuss-budget (if you don't understand that slang term, I suggest you consult an on-line urban dictionary).  In doing so, he and his long-suffering wife Cheryl (portrayed sympathetically by the incomparable Cheryl Hines) make themselves two of the most relatable characters currently on television.",5,Fussy Larry does it again!,1126137600,"09 8, 2005",2005,1120,"['have', 'written', 'reviews', 'previous', 'season', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'were', 'positive', 'were', 'somewhat', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'used', 'very', 'unusual', 'phonetic', 'spelling', 'very', 'loosely', 'coded', 'slang', 'figured', 'hard-core', 'viewers', 'show', 'would', 'understand', 'Well', 'had', 'ladies', 'gentleman', 'alike', 'explain', 'reviews', 'language', 'made', 'up', 'were', 'too', 'difficult', 'So', ""'ve"", 'decided', 'drop', 'comedy', 'play', 'straight', 'review', 'preposterously', 'overrated', 'Seinfeld', 'show', 'Larry', 'David', 'chord', 'much', 'deeper', 'nonsense', 'such', 'soup-nazi', 'one', 'weaker', 'socio-political', 'aspects', 'Seinfeld', 'total', 'disrespect', 'historical', 'events', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'trivialized', ""'jokes"", 'Larry', 'David', 'fact', 'portray', 'stereotypical', 'fuss-budget', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'slang', 'term', 'suggest', 'consult', 'on-line', 'urban', 'dictionary', 'doing', 'so', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'Cheryl', 'portrayed', 'sympathetically', 'incomparable', 'Cheryl', 'Hines', 'make', 'two', 'most', 'relatable', 'characters', 'currently', 'television']",Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 4
914758,A3B6X5KB0W963D,B0009WIE34,Troll Reviewer,"[0, 0]","The first three episodes of the fourth season of the brilliant TV series ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" are a little worrying. They're both pretty solid, although overall, they don't quite match the quality of the first three episodes of the past two seasons. ""Mel's Offer,"" although thoroughly entertaining and introducing one of the show's greatest story arcs, is a good example of Larry David stretching too far and trying too hard to be funny. The next two episodes are another example of an episode having a good plot, but relying too much on generic comedic cliches and physical slapstick for its humor. For a show that started off very realistic and life-like, this caused me to wonder whether or not season four would be as good as the previous two seasons.However, the season only starts off rocky. After that, it quickly gets back to the same quality it had before with an unheralded classic (""The Weatherman""), which is the first episode to have little-to-no 'The Producers' stuff in it, but has a storyline that's interesting enough on its own. Next up is a fan favorite (""The 5 Wood""), in which Larry gets Jeff and Susie kicked out of a country club over his five wood being in a funeral casket. ""The Car Pool Lane"" is another fan favorite (although slightly overrated in my opinion) about Larry finding an innovative way to use the HOV lane in order to attend a baseball game on time.The next two episodes are pretty solid, with the former featuring Wanda Sykes. Unfortunately, though, I think it's the only episode Wanda Sykes appears in. More of her would have been nice. After that is a brilliant episode with a sub-plot of whether or not a 'Survivor' game show member or a Holocaust survivor had it worse in their respective events. ""Opening Night"" is a series-best, with all the different sub-plots coming together in a brilliant second half, as well as an interesting plot twist near the end.Two things I liked about this season are that it was more coherent than the past three (having much more focus on 'The Producers' storyline) and that certain guest stars (especially Ben Stiller) were used very well. However, a little more Wanda Sykes would have been nice, and the first three episodes, although still at least good, weren't really up to CYE standards. Otherwise, another excellent season of an excellent show.Best episodes: ""The 5 Wood"" and ""Opening Night""Season grade: A-",4,"Starts off rocky, but eventually gets back to the same quality as before",1377388800,"08 25, 2013",2013,2393,"['first', 'three', 'episodes', 'fourth', 'season', 'brilliant', 'TV', 'series', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'are', 'little', 'worrying', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'solid', 'overall', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'match', 'quality', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'past', 'two', 'seasons', 'Mel', 'Offer', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'introducing', 'one', 'show', 'greatest', 'story', 'arcs', 'good', 'example', 'Larry', 'David', 'stretching', 'too', 'far', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'funny', 'next', 'two', 'episodes', 'are', 'example', 'episode', 'having', 'good', 'plot', 'relying', 'too', 'much', 'generic', 'comedic', 'cliches', 'physical', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'show', 'started', 'off', 'very', 'realistic', 'life-like', 'caused', 'wonder', 'not', 'season', 'four', 'would', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'previous', 'two', 'seasons.However', 'season', 'only', 'rocky', 'quickly', 'back', 'same', 'quality', 'had', 'unheralded', 'classic', 'Weatherman', 'first', 'episode', 'have', 'little-to-no', ""'The"", 'Producers', 'stuff', 'storyline', 'interesting', 'enough', 'own', 'Next', 'up', 'fan', 'favorite', '5', 'Wood', 'Larry', 'Jeff', 'Susie', 'kicked', 'country', 'club', 'five', 'wood', 'being', 'funeral', 'casket', 'Car', 'Pool', 'Lane', 'fan', 'favorite', 'slightly', 'overrated', 'opinion', 'Larry', 'finding', 'innovative', 'way', 'use', 'HOV', 'lane', 'order', 'attend', 'baseball', 'game', 'time.The', 'next', 'two', 'episodes', 'are', 'pretty', 'solid', 'former', 'featuring', 'Wanda', 'Sykes', 'Unfortunately', 'think', 'only', 'episode', 'Wanda', 'Sykes', 'More', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'brilliant', 'episode', 'sub-plot', 'not', ""'Survivor"", 'game', 'show', 'member', 'Holocaust', 'survivor', 'had', 'worse', 'respective', 'events', 'Opening', 'Night', 'series-best', 'different', 'sub-plots', 'coming', 'together', 'brilliant', 'second', 'half', 'as', 'well', 'interesting', 'plot', 'twist', 'end.Two', 'things', 'liked', 'season', 'are', 'was', 'more', 'coherent', 'past', 'three', 'having', 'much', 'more', 'focus', ""'The"", 'Producers', 'storyline', 'certain', 'guest', 'stars', 'especially', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'were', 'used', 'very', 'well', 'However', 'little', 'more', 'Wanda', 'Sykes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'still', 'least', 'good', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'up', 'CYE', 'standards', 'Otherwise', 'excellent', 'season', 'excellent', 'show.Best', 'episodes', '5', 'Wood', 'Opening', 'Night', 'Season', 'grade', 'A-']",Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 4

914760,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B0009WIE34,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[3, 3]","This season continues the awkward hilarity of Larry David's escapades. In this season he stars in a Broadway production of The Producers with Ben Stiller (and then David Schwimmer when Stiller can't put up with Larry), tries to follow through on his anniversary gift from Cheryl (after 10 years of marriage, he's allowed to have sex with another woman, if he can make it happen),  hires a Native American to do his landscaping (and help with another problem of Cheryl's), helps his secretary get back together with her boyfriend, accuses a weatherman of lying to clear the golf courses and much more.I watched 8 of the 10 episodes directly one after the other. The only reason I had to stop was 4 hours of any show is enoguh. This season is more cohesive as a season than previous ones have been. Story lines followed over into the next episodes more often than they have in the past.But overall, I think this was the weakest of the 4 seasons leading up to this point. I think that just has to do with the stakes being raised so high. In previous seasons Larry dealt with small every day things, whereas in this season he's starring in a Broadway musical and trying to hook up a blind guy with a date.That being said, it's still one of the funniest things on television. Larry still delivers the laugh. And any scene with Jeff or Cheryl is almost guaranteed to be hilarious. Surprisingly, the best guest star was a young boy playing Cheryl's nephew, who refuses to teach Larry a magic trick because he's ""not a magician"".There are no extras on the DVDs, but really what extras do you need when you have 10 episodes of Curb Your Enthusiasm?",4,My enthusiasm for Larry David cannot be curbed,1166572800,"12 20, 2006",2006,1639,"['season', 'awkward', 'hilarity', 'Larry', 'David', 'escapades', 'season', 'Broadway', 'production', 'Producers', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'then', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'when', 'Stiller', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'up', 'Larry', 'follow', 'anniversary', 'gift', 'Cheryl', '10', 'years', 'marriage', 'allowed', 'have', 'sex', 'woman', 'can', 'make', 'happen', 'Native', 'American', 'do', 'landscaping', 'help', 'problem', 'Cheryl', 'secretary', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'boyfriend', 'weatherman', 'lying', 'clear', 'golf', 'courses', 'much', 'more.I', 'watched', '8', '10', 'episodes', 'directly', 'one', 'other', 'only', 'reason', 'had', 'stop', 'was', '4', 'hours', 'show', 'enoguh', 'season', 'more', 'cohesive', 'season', 'previous', 'ones', 'have', 'been', 'Story', 'lines', 'followed', 'next', 'more', 'often', 'have', 'past.But', 'overall', 'think', 'was', 'weakest', '4', 'seasons', 'leading', 'up', 'point', 'think', 'just', 'do', 'stakes', 'being', 'raised', 'so', 'high', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Larry', 'dealt', 'small', 'day', 'things', 'whereas', 'season', 'starring', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'trying', 'hook', 'up', 'blind', 'guy', 'date.That', 'being', 'said', 'still', 'one', 'funniest', 'things', 'television', 'Larry', 'still', 'laugh', 'scene', 'Jeff', 'Cheryl', 'almost', 'guaranteed', 'be', 'hilarious', 'Surprisingly', 'best', 'guest', 'star', 'was', 'young', 'boy', 'playing', 'Cheryl', 'nephew', 'who', 'teach', 'Larry', 'magic', 'trick', 'not', 'magician', 'are', 'extras', 'DVDs', 'really', 'what', 'extras', 'do', 'need', 'when', 'have', '10', 'episodes', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm']",Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 4
