149822,ANGH6401L9Y0T,0792843800,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 2]","I was five years old when this movie was new, and I think my parents must have taken me to it in the theater, because it's one of the few I remember in color, and we never had a color TV. But I missed the writing at the beginning that said this was a fairy tale about Hans, and not really the story of his life. It would be interesting to know just how much truth there is in it.Danny Kaye did a beautiful job as Hans, a cobbler who gets into trouble with the authorities of his small town because he makes the children late for school by entertaining them with stories and flying kites. So he and his apprentice take off for ""Wonderful, Wonderful Copenhagen,"" just one of the great songs in this movie. There's a cute scene where he tells the story of the Ugly Duckling to a little boy who had his hair shaved off because he was sick. Soon after he is asked to go to the newspaper office, where the publisher tells him that he is the father of the Ugly Duckling, and he's going to print the story in the next day's paper. He also says if Hans will write down some of his stories, the publisher will pay him for them. Hans is overjoyed, considering himself a ""real writer.""Entirely by accident, he is asked to repair the shoes of the beautiful prima ballerina of the Royal Ballet. He falls in love with her, believing her to be unhappy with her husband the dance master. Actually the couple truly love each other, but love fighting with each other, too. (They call that codependent these days. In those days they were just a little crazy.)Hans writes a ballet story for her, The Little Mermaid, and she performs it. But much of the ballet in the movie is actually in Hans' imagination, including the Little Mermaid, since he's locked in a closet by the irate husband/ballet master to keep him out of the way. When Hans discovers that she really loves her husband, he returns to the village.It's a simple story, and if you don't care much for ballet, it may get tiresome. But the music is grand, the costumes and sets are beautiful, and the boy who plays Hans' apprentice is truly charming. This would be a great movie to share with your children or grandchildren.",3,Song and Dance and Fairy Tales,1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,2163,"['was', 'five', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'new', 'think', 'parents', 'must', 'have', 'taken', 'theater', 'one', 'few', 'remember', 'color', 'never', 'had', 'color', 'TV', 'missed', 'writing', 'beginning', 'said', 'was', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Hans', 'not', 'really', 'story', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'know', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'truth', 'it.Danny', 'Kaye', 'did', 'beautiful', 'job', 'Hans', 'cobbler', 'who', 'trouble', 'authorities', 'small', 'town', 'children', 'late', 'school', 'entertaining', 'stories', 'flying', 'kites', 'apprentice', 'take', 'off', 'Wonderful', 'Wonderful', 'Copenhagen', 'just', 'one', 'great', 'songs', 'movie', 'cute', 'scene', 'where', 'story', 'Ugly', 'Duckling', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'had', 'hair', 'shaved', 'off', 'was', 'sick', 'Soon', 'asked', 'go', 'newspaper', 'office', 'where', 'publisher', 'father', 'Ugly', 'Duckling', 'going', 'print', 'story', 'next', 'day', 'paper', 'also', 'Hans', 'will', 'write', 'down', 'stories', 'publisher', 'will', 'pay', 'Hans', 'overjoyed', 'considering', 'real', 'writer', 'Entirely', 'accident', 'asked', 'repair', 'shoes', 'beautiful', 'prima', 'ballerina', 'Royal', 'Ballet', 'love', 'believing', 'be', 'unhappy', 'husband', 'dance', 'master', 'Actually', 'couple', 'truly', 'love', 'other', 'love', 'fighting', 'other', 'too', 'call', 'codependent', 'days', 'days', 'were', 'just', 'little', 'crazy', 'Hans', 'ballet', 'story', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'much', 'ballet', 'movie', 'actually', 'Hans', 'imagination', 'including', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'locked', 'closet', 'irate', 'husband/ballet', 'master', 'keep', 'way', 'When', 'discovers', 'really', 'husband', 'village.It', 'simple', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'ballet', 'may', 'get', 'tiresome', 'music', 'grand', 'costumes', 'sets', 'are', 'beautiful', 'boy', 'who', 'Hans', 'apprentice', 'truly', 'charming', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'movie', 'share', 'children', 'grandchildren']",Hans Christian Andersen VHS

149827,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,0792843800,Byron Kolln,"[38, 40]","HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN presents a fanciful, fictionalised re-telling of the famed storyteller's life, highlighted by Frank Loesser's beautiful score and the perfect casting of Danny Kaye in the central role.As the film opens, cobbler Hans is entertaining the children of Odense, Denmark, with yet another fantastic tale, much to the consternation of the schoolmaster who feels the children are having their time wasted when they should be studying.  This seems to be the opinion of most of the townspeople, so Hans is politely told to leave town...for a while anyway.  Hans and his young assistant travel to the bright lights and bustle of Copenhagen for a fresh start, but old habits die hard and soon Hans is entertaining a new group of children with his amazing storytelling talents.  When Hans is engaged to make slippers and toe-shoes for the city's ballet troupe, he becomes entranced by the prima ballerina Doro (Zizi Jeanmaire in her film debut) not knowing that she's married to the troupe's tough choreographer Niels (Farley Granger).  His story of ""The Little Mermaid"", inspired by Doro, becomes the ballet's new work, but discovering the truth, Hans returns to Odense a hero, his storytelling now famous all over Europe.Danny Kaye is just was is called for in the role of Hans.  His natural warmth, fatherly air and ability to combine pathos and heart serves him well in his performance.  Zizi Jeanmaire as the glamorous Doro likewise is perfect casting (although Moira Shearer from ""The Red Shoes"" was first choice, pregnancy prevented her from doing the film).  Having shot to fame in husband Roland Petit's ballet version of ""Carmen"", Jeanmaire adds a European beauty and elegance to her role, and Petit staged all the ballet numbers in this film too.  Farley Granger's Niels is the perfect foil to Danny Kaye's innocent and childlike Hans, and the love triangle is thrillingly brought to life in the Dream Ballet.Frank Loesser's score is what most people remember the film for, and it's one of the best written by the legendary composer-lyricist.  He had just come from his phenomenal success on Broadway with the score of ""Guys and Dolls"" and Hollywood was eager for him to ply his trade for the movie musicals of the 1950's.  Songs like ""Thumbelina"", ""The Ugly Duckling"", ""Wonderful Wonderful Copenhagen"" and ""I'm Hans Christian Andersen"" have become well-known standards.  ""Inchworm"", bookended by children chanting their times tables, is so lovely and gentle in it's beauty, and ""No Two People"" is a jaunty little duet for Hans and Doro in the Dream Ballet.This film was beautifully-photographed by Oscar-nominee Harry Stradling.  The film also received Oscar nominations for Costume Design (Mary Wills, Madame Karinska), Art Direction/Set Decoration, Best Music Scoring (Walter Scharf), Best Song and Best Sound Recording.  The Technicolor photography is absolutely stunning and the bold colours pop off the screen with their brightness and clarity.",4,"Enchanting, elegant study of filmmaking in the early 50's",1141171200,"03 1, 2006",2006,2971,"['HANS', 'CHRISTIAN', 'ANDERSEN', 'fanciful', 'fictionalised', 're-telling', 'famed', 'storyteller', 'life', 'highlighted', 'Frank', 'Loesser', 'beautiful', 'score', 'perfect', 'casting', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'central', 'role.As', 'film', 'cobbler', 'Hans', 'entertaining', 'children', 'Odense', 'Denmark', 'yet', 'fantastic', 'tale', 'much', 'consternation', 'schoolmaster', 'who', 'children', 'are', 'having', 'time', 'wasted', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'studying', 'be', 'opinion', 'most', 'townspeople', 'so', 'Hans', 'politely', 'told', 'leave', 'town', 'while', 'anyway', 'Hans', 'young', 'assistant', 'travel', 'bright', 'lights', 'bustle', 'Copenhagen', 'fresh', 'start', 'old', 'habits', 'die', 'hard', 'soon', 'Hans', 'entertaining', 'new', 'group', 'children', 'amazing', 'storytelling', 'talents', 'When', 'Hans', 'engaged', 'make', 'slippers', 'toe-shoes', 'city', 'ballet', 'troupe', 'entranced', 'prima', 'ballerina', 'Doro', 'Zizi', 'Jeanmaire', 'film', 'debut', 'not', 'knowing', 'married', 'troupe', 'tough', 'choreographer', 'Niels', 'Farley', 'Granger', 'story', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'inspired', 'Doro', 'ballet', 'new', 'work', 'discovering', 'truth', 'Hans', 'Odense', 'hero', 'storytelling', 'now', 'famous', 'Europe.Danny', 'Kaye', 'just', 'was', 'called', 'role', 'Hans', 'natural', 'warmth', 'fatherly', 'air', 'ability', 'combine', 'pathos', 'heart', 'well', 'performance', 'Zizi', 'Jeanmaire', 'glamorous', 'Doro', 'likewise', 'perfect', 'casting', 'Moira', 'Shearer', 'Red', 'Shoes', 'was', 'first', 'choice', 'pregnancy', 'prevented', 'doing', 'film', 'Having', 'shot', 'fame', 'husband', 'Roland', 'Petit', 'ballet', 'version', 'Carmen', 'Jeanmaire', 'European', 'beauty', 'elegance', 'role', 'Petit', 'staged', 'ballet', 'numbers', 'film', 'too', 'Farley', 'Granger', 'Niels', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'innocent', 'childlike', 'Hans', 'love', 'triangle', 'thrillingly', 'brought', 'life', 'Dream', 'Ballet.Frank', 'Loesser', 'score', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'remember', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'written', 'legendary', 'composer-lyricist', 'had', 'just', 'come', 'phenomenal', 'success', 'Broadway', 'score', 'Guys', 'Dolls', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'eager', 'ply', 'trade', 'movie', 'musicals', '1950', 'Songs', 'Thumbelina', 'Ugly', 'Duckling', 'Wonderful', 'Wonderful', 'Copenhagen', ""'m"", 'Hans', 'Christian', 'Andersen', 'have', 'become', 'well-known', 'standards', 'Inchworm', 'bookended', 'children', 'chanting', 'times', 'tables', 'so', 'lovely', 'gentle', 'beauty', 'No', 'Two', 'People', 'jaunty', 'little', 'duet', 'Hans', 'Doro', 'Dream', 'Ballet.This', 'film', 'was', 'beautifully-photographed', 'Oscar-nominee', 'Harry', 'Stradling', 'film', 'also', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'Costume', 'Design', 'Mary', 'Wills', 'Madame', 'Karinska', 'Art', 'Direction/Set', 'Decoration', 'Best', 'Music', 'Scoring', 'Walter', 'Scharf', 'Best', 'Song', 'Best', 'Sound', 'Recording', 'Technicolor', 'photography', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'bold', 'colours', 'pop', 'screen', 'brightness', 'clarity']",Hans Christian Andersen VHS

149831,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,0792843800,Deborah Earle,"[1, 1]","This beautiful 1952 film showcases Danny Kaye in his element, filled with tuneful songs, many to which I was introduced courtesy of an album on which they were sung by a children's choir years before I actually saw the film.Myles Connolly's Moss Hart's and Ben Hecht's fairly tale of this teller of fairy tales finds us in early 19th century Odense where Hans the cobbler is telling stories to the local children on a beautiful day when they should be in school. After giving an amusing recital of ""The Emperor's New Clothes"", Hans' young apprentice, Peter(Joey Walsh) warns him that a very irate Schoolmaster (John Brown), and Burgomaster (John Qualen) are on their way to confront him about keeping the children away from school with his tales.The confrontation, in which Hans states that there are different ways of learning things seems to touch upon the unspoken issue of Andersen's real-life dyslexia.Soon enough, there is a concerted effort to drive Hans out of town. To smooth things over, the ever-practical Peter suggests that Hans go to Copenhagenwithout telling him about the Burgomaster's decison.So, off Hans goes, and soon enough, Peter, who was initially supposed to be in charge of the shop in Hans' absence decides to join him and the two begin a marvelous adventure.""Wonderful, Wonderful Copenhagen"" is celebrated in song as the two travel by ship in a glorious moment. Soon, they are mingling with the street vendors in the town square, and we see indirect fodder for the now-familiar stories of Andersen,perhaps most notably the sweetly singing match girl, portrayed by ""It's a Wonderful Life's"" own little Zuzu, Karolyn Grimes.With his usual song and good humor, Hans introduces himself and his business to those in the square, but ends up under arrest for unwittingly  showing disrespect for the King's statue. Peter, who was also wanted for the same charge, escapes.While peering out of his cell, Hans converses with a lovely little girl( Beverly Washburn), whom he amuses with the tale of Thumbelina. Peter's chance encounter with an official from the Royal Danish Ballet who was in need of a cobbler helps win Hans' release.The country cobbler is enchanted at his first encounter with ballet, and with its lead dancer, the beautiful Doro (Zizi Jeanmaire). But the balletmaster Niels(Farley Granger)remains unimpressed by the dress rehearsal performance and, hard taskmaster that he is, makes them do it all over again.Peter witnesses the full subsequent interaction between Doro and Niels, watching it go from loving to violent and back again. But Hans, viewing only the negative scene is appalled by Niels' behavior, and stunned to learn that they are married. He fantasizes about rescuing and perhaps even marrying Doro, brushing aside Peter's astute observations about their earlier interaction with each other.Given his orders, he creates shoes for the ballet during they daytime. But writes a story that he hopes will speak to Doro by night.When the ballet moves out on its annual tour, leaving Hans and Peter in Copenhagen, they continue to work, but Hans cannot get the beautiful danseuse out of his mind.His days are spent working on shoes and amusing local schoolchildren with his tales, as was the case back home in Odense. But one particular tale of the Ugly Duckling, told to cheer up a young boy recovering from illness named Lars (Peter Votrian) results in his stories being published in the local newspaper by the boy's father, who is the editor.It's a lovely scene that also touches on Danny Kaye's real-life humanitarian work.The brief, sweetly-sung ballad, ""Anywhere I Wander"", summarizes Hans'ongoing yearnings. The song, ""No Two People"" features Kaye's trademark patter number with Jeanmaire in tow. When the ballet returns to Copenhagen, there are plans to put on  a performance of Hans' story, ""The Little Mermaid"". Peter can see that his gullible boss is being used by Niels and Doro and laughed at behind his back. But Hans' swelling ego blinds him to this fact.One more reverently beautful ballet scene stands between Hans, and the final resolution of this story--an elegantly charming masterpiece that keeps on giving time after time!",5,Anywhere You Wander...This Film Will be Considered a Classic!,1253145600,"09 17, 2009",2009,4186,"['beautiful', '1952', 'film', 'showcases', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'element', 'filled', 'tuneful', 'songs', 'many', 'was', 'introduced', 'courtesy', 'album', 'were', 'sung', 'children', 'choir', 'years', 'actually', 'saw', 'film.Myles', 'Connolly', 'Moss', 'Hart', 'Ben', 'Hecht', 'fairly', 'tale', 'teller', 'fairy', 'tales', 'early', '19th', 'century', 'Odense', 'where', 'Hans', 'cobbler', 'telling', 'stories', 'local', 'children', 'beautiful', 'day', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'school', 'giving', 'amusing', 'recital', 'Emperor', 'New', 'Clothes', 'Hans', 'young', 'apprentice', 'Peter', 'Joey', 'Walsh', 'very', 'irate', 'Schoolmaster', 'John', 'Brown', 'Burgomaster', 'John', 'Qualen', 'are', 'way', 'confront', 'keeping', 'children', 'away', 'school', 'tales.The', 'confrontation', 'Hans', 'are', 'different', 'ways', 'learning', 'things', 'touch', 'unspoken', 'issue', 'Andersen', 'real-life', 'dyslexia.Soon', 'enough', 'concerted', 'effort', 'drive', 'Hans', 'town', 'smooth', 'things', 'ever-practical', 'Peter', 'Hans', 'go', 'Copenhagenwithout', 'telling', 'Burgomaster', 'decison.So', 'off', 'Hans', 'soon', 'enough', 'Peter', 'who', 'was', 'initially', 'supposed', 'be', 'charge', 'shop', 'Hans', 'absence', 'decides', 'join', 'two', 'begin', 'marvelous', 'adventure', 'Wonderful', 'Wonderful', 'Copenhagen', 'celebrated', 'song', 'two', 'travel', 'ship', 'glorious', 'moment', 'Soon', 'are', 'mingling', 'street', 'vendors', 'town', 'square', 'see', 'indirect', 'fodder', 'now-familiar', 'stories', 'Andersen', 'perhaps', 'most', 'notably', 'sweetly', 'singing', 'match', 'girl', 'portrayed', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'own', 'little', 'Zuzu', 'Karolyn', 'Grimes.With', 'usual', 'song', 'good', 'humor', 'Hans', 'introduces', 'business', 'square', 'up', 'arrest', 'unwittingly', 'showing', 'disrespect', 'King', 'statue', 'Peter', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'wanted', 'same', 'charge', 'escapes.While', 'peering', 'cell', 'converses', 'lovely', 'little', 'girl', 'Beverly', 'Washburn', 'whom', 'tale', 'Thumbelina', 'Peter', 'chance', 'encounter', 'official', 'Royal', 'Danish', 'Ballet', 'who', 'was', 'need', 'cobbler', 'win', 'Hans', 'release.The', 'country', 'cobbler', 'enchanted', 'first', 'encounter', 'ballet', 'lead', 'dancer', 'beautiful', 'Doro', 'Zizi', 'Jeanmaire', 'balletmaster', 'Niels', 'Farley', 'Granger', 'unimpressed', 'dress', 'rehearsal', 'performance', 'hard', 'taskmaster', 'do', 'again.Peter', 'witnesses', 'full', 'subsequent', 'interaction', 'Doro', 'Niels', 'watching', 'go', 'loving', 'violent', 'back', 'again', 'Hans', 'viewing', 'only', 'negative', 'scene', 'appalled', 'Niels', 'behavior', 'stunned', 'learn', 'are', 'married', 'rescuing', 'perhaps', 'even', 'marrying', 'Doro', 'brushing', 'aside', 'Peter', 'astute', 'observations', 'earlier', 'interaction', 'other.Given', 'orders', 'shoes', 'ballet', 'daytime', 'story', 'will', 'speak', 'Doro', 'ballet', 'out', 'annual', 'tour', 'leaving', 'Hans', 'Peter', 'Copenhagen', 'continue', 'work', 'Hans', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'beautiful', 'danseuse', 'mind.His', 'days', 'are', 'spent', 'working', 'shoes', 'amusing', 'local', 'schoolchildren', 'tales', 'was', 'case', 'back', 'home', 'Odense', 'one', 'particular', 'tale', 'Ugly', 'Duckling', 'told', 'cheer', 'up', 'young', 'boy', 'recovering', 'illness', 'named', 'Lars', 'Peter', 'Votrian', 'results', 'stories', 'being', 'published', 'local', 'newspaper', 'boy', 'father', 'who', 'editor.It', 'lovely', 'scene', 'also', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'real-life', 'humanitarian', 'work.The', 'brief', 'sweetly-sung', 'ballad', 'Anywhere', 'Wander', ""Hans'ongoing"", 'yearnings', 'song', 'No', 'Two', 'People', 'Kaye', 'trademark', 'patter', 'number', 'Jeanmaire', 'tow', 'When', 'ballet', 'returns', 'Copenhagen', 'are', 'plans', 'put', 'performance', 'Hans', 'story', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'Peter', 'can', 'see', 'gullible', 'boss', 'being', 'used', 'Niels', 'Doro', 'laughed', 'back', 'Hans', 'swelling', 'ego', 'blinds', 'fact.One', 'more', 'reverently', 'beautful', 'ballet', 'scene', 'Hans', 'final', 'resolution', 'story', 'elegantly', 'charming', 'masterpiece', 'giving', 'time', 'time']",Hans Christian Andersen VHS

149843,A2BC978GQQEA2A,0792843800,Jeffrey Pidgeon,"[8, 18]","I'm not a big fan of musicals or Danny Kaye films, so ""Hans Christian Andersen"" had a steep uphill battle to win me over. The whole film is painfully earnest, which can certainly set the stage for a good post-modern mocking. I steeled myself to bear the brunt of a flimsy plot strung with forgettable patter songs that Kaye would burble as he hopped about, twiddling his fingers or something. I was surprised to find that, while the film has it flaws, beneath its surface lay a thoughtful, affecting story. Not only was it engaging, but it had a few things to say about the joys - and pitfalls - of fantasy.Mr. Kaye (of course) plays Hans, a small-town cobbler who spends most of his time flying kites and telling stories to the local children. He does this so much, in fact, the schoolmaster successfully campaigns to have him driven from town. To save his pride, his apprentice Peter (Joseph Walsh) talks Hans into travelling to The Big City - in this case, Copenhagen. Between this exchange, and the travelling song that follows it, the word ""Copenhagen"" is said about a thousand times, or a least enough for a small-scale drinking game. It isn't long after arriving that Hans and Peter set up shop in their ""temporary"" home. Unfortunately, it also isn't long before Hans gets thrown into jail through his ignorance of the city's laws. Happily though, one of the gentry pays to have the cobbler freed.Things get more complicated when the benefactor enlists Hans to make new ballet slippers for Doro (dancer Zizi Jeanmaire), the prima donna of the local ballet company. One look at her and Hans is smitten, blinded to everything. Doro's marriage to the company director Niels (Farley Granger) is tempestuous, and Hans misreads this to be a damsel in need of rescue. More fuel is added to the fire when the company adapts ""The Little Mermaid"" (ostensibly written as a love letter to Doro) as a ballet. Peter tries desperately to warn Hans, but a painful collision with reality is inevitable.Interestingly, it is Hans' very gift at immersing himself so completely into his dreams that gets him in the most trouble. Indeed, his burgeoning career as a writer and his friendship with Peter are almost destroyed by his romantic fantasies. While Hans does go on to storybook immortality, his tall tales seem to be double-edged swords, giving the frothy plot depth and emotion. It's a far cry from the modern take of stories as teachers and healers, innately resolving any conflicts by the final curtain.Many of Mr. Loesser's songs are bright and fun (""Thumbelina"" is a highlight, and viewers may remember ""Inchworm"" from a later episode of ""The Muppet Show""), and the art direction, while cluttered at times, is fairy-tale cheerful. Some sequences are overlong (the climactic ballet especially so), and the ending seems rather abrupt (Hans makes the transition back from crushed cobbler back to chipper writer in a single scene), but all in all ""Hans Christian Andersen"" is a charming musical with some intriguing ideas.",2,Telling Stories,1144886400,"04 13, 2006",2006,3015,"[""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'musicals', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'films', 'Hans', 'Christian', 'Andersen', 'had', 'steep', 'uphill', 'battle', 'win', 'whole', 'film', 'painfully', 'earnest', 'can', 'certainly', 'set', 'stage', 'good', 'post-modern', 'mocking', 'steeled', 'bear', 'brunt', 'flimsy', 'plot', 'strung', 'forgettable', 'patter', 'songs', 'Kaye', 'would', 'burble', 'hopped', 'about', 'twiddling', 'fingers', 'something', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'film', 'beneath', 'surface', 'lay', 'thoughtful', 'affecting', 'story', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'engaging', 'had', 'few', 'things', 'say', 'joys', 'pitfalls', 'fantasy.Mr', 'Kaye', 'course', 'Hans', 'small-town', 'cobbler', 'who', 'most', 'time', 'flying', 'kites', 'telling', 'stories', 'local', 'children', 'so', 'much', 'fact', 'schoolmaster', 'successfully', 'campaigns', 'have', 'driven', 'town', 'save', 'pride', 'apprentice', 'Peter', 'Joseph', 'Walsh', 'talks', 'Hans', 'travelling', 'Big', 'City', 'case', 'Copenhagen', 'Between', 'exchange', 'travelling', 'song', 'word', 'Copenhagen', 'said', 'thousand', 'times', 'least', 'enough', 'small-scale', 'drinking', 'game', ""n't"", 'long', 'arriving', 'Hans', 'Peter', 'set', 'up', 'shop', 'temporary', 'home', 'Unfortunately', 'also', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'Hans', 'thrown', 'jail', 'ignorance', 'city', 'laws', 'Happily', 'one', 'gentry', 'have', 'cobbler', 'freed.Things', 'get', 'more', 'complicated', 'when', 'benefactor', 'Hans', 'make', 'new', 'ballet', 'slippers', 'Doro', 'dancer', 'Zizi', 'Jeanmaire', 'prima', 'donna', 'local', 'ballet', 'company', 'One', 'look', 'Hans', 'smitten', 'blinded', 'everything', 'Doro', 'marriage', 'company', 'director', 'Niels', 'Farley', 'Granger', 'tempestuous', 'Hans', 'be', 'damsel', 'need', 'rescue', 'More', 'fuel', 'added', 'fire', 'when', 'company', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'ostensibly', 'written', 'love', 'letter', 'Doro', 'ballet', 'Peter', 'desperately', 'warn', 'Hans', 'painful', 'collision', 'reality', 'inevitable.Interestingly', 'Hans', 'very', 'gift', 'immersing', 'so', 'completely', 'dreams', 'most', 'trouble', 'Indeed', 'burgeoning', 'career', 'writer', 'friendship', 'Peter', 'are', 'almost', 'destroyed', 'romantic', 'fantasies', 'Hans', 'go', 'storybook', 'immortality', 'tall', 'tales', 'seem', 'be', 'double-edged', 'swords', 'giving', 'frothy', 'plot', 'depth', 'emotion', 'far', 'cry', 'modern', 'take', 'stories', 'teachers', 'healers', 'innately', 'resolving', 'conflicts', 'final', 'curtain.Many', 'Mr.', 'Loesser', 'songs', 'are', 'bright', 'fun', 'Thumbelina', 'highlight', 'viewers', 'may', 'remember', 'Inchworm', 'later', 'episode', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'art', 'direction', 'cluttered', 'times', 'fairy-tale', 'cheerful', 'sequences', 'are', 'overlong', 'climactic', 'ballet', 'especially', 'so', 'ending', 'rather', 'abrupt', 'Hans', 'transition', 'back', 'crushed', 'cobbler', 'back', 'chipper', 'writer', 'single', 'scene', 'Hans', 'Christian', 'Andersen', 'charming', 'musical', 'intriguing', 'ideas']",Hans Christian Andersen VHS

So what happened?  Why is this movie so awful?  I guess it depends on how much you can take of Danny Kaye.When I was a boy he was acknowledged by our parents as the funniest man alive, and on Saturday afternoons we were herded into matinee re-releases of his biggest hits, all of them lousy in my eyes, but my mom and dad thought them all laugh fests.  Even the sad story of THE FIVE PENNIES fit into this category, ie lousy.  This was my first experience with the terrible shock all children feel when we first find out our parents are 100 per cent wrong.  Danny Kaye would be up there on the screen in that motley cap with little bells on it, playing medieval in THE COURT JESTER, and all the parents in the theater would be sobbing with laughter, while all the kids were snarling and mashing chewing gum into the cement floor of the cinema.  In HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN, Danny Kaye is platonically, but extremely in love with Zizi Jeanmaire, and even way back then I knew she was mis-cast.  The filmmmakers must have wanted to use either Leslie Caron or Moira Shearer, and instead somehow wound up with the giggly, cross eyed Jeanmaire who sort of looks like a taller version of Georgette on THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW.  In the meantime she is married to Farley Granger.  The erotic tension between Danny Kaye, supposedly a heterosexual, and Farley Granger, ditto, is greater than that of Granger and John Dall in Hitchcock's ROPE, with Jeanmaire sort of a substitute shuttlecock the two are parrying over, like a piece of Steuben glass.  She's dreadful and she dances through at least 45 minutes of the movie.  Her name is ""Doro,"" I suppose sort of a Danish name, but really nobody ever was named ""Doro.""The real Danish beauty is Erik Bruhn, the best dancer of the 1950s, who has a prominent part in the dancing and almost saves it from Petit's wretched excess, but actually you'll have more fun just pressing your freeze frame button on Bruhn's beefcake, without having to actually watch the choreography (he's in the ice skating ballet).Frank Loesser's songs are all good, but there's only six or seven of them.  Danny Kaye hams it up and hogs them all.

149870,A23CN2QNJBEL8H,0792843800,"Roger Strutton ""A Young Oldy but GOING STRONG""","[129, 134]","Hans Christian Andersen (1805-75) was an Ugly Duckling. He lived in the third largest town Odense, in Denmark. The son of a cobbler he was poverty ridden and a failure as an actor and it wasn't until he moved to Copenhagen  and won the patronage of Frederick VI, through his poetry, that he wrote  his fairy tales and developed into a swan. Like many artists he wasn't  particularly happy, and never did marry, although he was very fond of Jenny  Lind (1820-87) the Swedish Nightingale a soprano given the name by P.T.  Barnum during her tour of the United States between 1850-52.)  Charles Vidor's film does state at the beginning, This is not the story of  Hans Christian Andersen but a fairy tale about the great spinner of fairy  tales. The Danes objected to the way Hans Christian Andersen was portrayed  even though Goldwyn had rejected 21 previous manuscripts, so the film  company inserted this statement in the credits.Danny Kaye with his  chiselled features does resemble H.C.Andersen when looking at his profile,  but apart from this facial feature that's where it stops. Kaye had dark  hair but Hollywood soon changed that and he became a blonde, Andersen also  had dark hair but he kept it that way.Unlike some earlier musicals,  this film does have a strong story line with loads of songs written by  &quot;Baby, It's Cold Outside&quot;, Frank Loessen, such as Thumbelina,  Ugly Duckling, No Two People, and of course Wonderful Copenhagen. The  scenery is very clever, the backgrounds look like illustrations from fairy  tale books, but as the camera zooms in to the foreground the buildings and  props become three dimensional similar to a pop-up-book.There are  four ballet scenes that I probably found boring back in `52, but revisiting  them now, they are visually very interesting, technically I wouldn't know  if they are good or mediocre but for a Hollywood musical film, four ballets  must of taken an enormous amount of consideration seeing as the film is  really for kids. Once again the backdrops for the ballets also resemble  fairy tale illustrations and pop-up-books.Instead of a soprano,  Andersen falls in love with a ballet dancer and here's a musical that  doesn't have a very happy ending because poor Hans gets mixed up with a  married woman. The ballet dancer Doro, is played by Zizi Jeanmaire, and is  married to Niels played by Farley Granger. During the last part of the  film, the audience is taken behind the scenes of the ballet company playing  at the Royal Theater in Copenhagen, but this isn't a film of a show  included in a show, similar to earlier musicals, but an uplifting musical  film with lots of music with catchy tunes helped by a ton of children.The last ballet scene takes 17 minutes, quite long for a popular movie. In  the film Hans writes a story especially for his love Doro, unfortunately  Niels locks him in a cupboard so Andersen never sees her perform but has to  use his imagination.The ballet takes place on land and under the  ocean. The surface waves are pop-up so that the dancers can be seen dancing  in between the swells, it's really very clever visually, and there's no  trickery here. Under the sea filled with monsters and witches, the heroine  is probably attached to a pulley so that she can be seen swimming for the  surface. There are no blue screens in this film, all effects are up-front  and work perfectly similar to a staged ballet. Once again the technicolor  process is used and this enhances the fairy tale effect with vivid  colors.Hans Christian Andersen fairy stories are not violent when  compared to the Grimm brothers, but the themes usually have a lesson, and  in the story written for Doro's ballet, &quot;The Little Mermaid,&quot; it  is saying that aiming for the stars does not always bring happiness, but  then of course Walt Disney hadn't yet arrived on the scene and he soon  changed that philosophy.",5,"Hans Christian Andersen not quite, but very entertaining",953251200,"03 17, 2000",2000,3901,"['Hans', 'Christian', 'Andersen', '1805-75', 'was', 'Ugly', 'Duckling', 'lived', 'third', 'largest', 'town', 'Odense', 'Denmark', 'son', 'cobbler', 'was', 'poverty', 'ridden', 'failure', 'actor', 'was', ""n't"", 'moved', 'Copenhagen', 'won', 'patronage', 'Frederick', 'VI', 'poetry', 'wrote', 'fairy', 'tales', 'developed', 'swan', 'many', 'artists', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'happy', 'never', 'did', 'marry', 'was', 'very', 'fond', 'Jenny', 'Lind', '1820-87', 'Swedish', 'Nightingale', 'soprano', 'given', 'name', 'P.T', 'Barnum', 'tour', 'United', 'States', '1850-52', 'Charles', 'Vidor', 'film', 'state', 'beginning', 'not', 'story', 'Hans', 'Christian', 'Andersen', 'fairy', 'tale', 'great', 'spinner', 'fairy', 'tales', 'Danes', 'objected', 'way', 'Hans', 'Christian', 'Andersen', 'was', 'portrayed', 'even', 'Goldwyn', 'had', 'rejected', '21', 'previous', 'manuscripts', 'film', 'company', 'inserted', 'statement', 'credits.Danny', 'Kaye', 'chiselled', 'features', 'resemble', 'H.C.Andersen', 'when', 'looking', 'profile', 'apart', 'facial', 'feature', 'where', 'Kaye', 'had', 'dark', 'hair', 'Hollywood', 'soon', 'changed', 'became', 'blonde', 'Andersen', 'also', 'had', 'dark', 'hair', 'kept', 'earlier', 'musicals', 'film', 'have', 'strong', 'story', 'line', 'loads', 'songs', 'written', 'quot', 'Baby', 'Cold', 'Outside', 'quot', 'Frank', 'Loessen', 'such', 'Thumbelina', 'Ugly', 'Duckling', 'No', 'Two', 'People', 'course', 'Wonderful', 'Copenhagen', 'scenery', 'very', 'clever', 'backgrounds', 'look', 'illustrations', 'fairy', 'tale', 'books', 'camera', 'foreground', 'buildings', 'become', 'three', 'dimensional', 'similar', 'pop-up-book.There', 'are', 'four', 'ballet', 'scenes', 'probably', 'found', 'boring', 'back', '52', 'revisiting', 'now', 'are', 'visually', 'very', 'interesting', 'technically', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'are', 'good', 'mediocre', 'Hollywood', 'musical', 'film', 'four', 'ballets', 'must', 'taken', 'enormous', 'amount', 'consideration', 'seeing', 'film', 'really', 'kids', 'Once', 'again', 'backdrops', 'ballets', 'also', 'resemble', 'fairy', 'tale', 'illustrations', 'pop-up-books.Instead', 'soprano', 'Andersen', 'love', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'here', 'musical', ""n't"", 'have', 'very', 'happy', 'ending', 'poor', 'Hans', 'mixed', 'up', 'married', 'woman', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'Doro', 'played', 'Zizi', 'Jeanmaire', 'married', 'Niels', 'played', 'Farley', 'Granger', 'last', 'part', 'film', 'audience', 'taken', 'scenes', 'ballet', 'company', 'playing', 'Royal', 'Theater', 'Copenhagen', ""n't"", 'film', 'show', 'included', 'show', 'similar', 'earlier', 'musicals', 'uplifting', 'musical', 'film', 'lots', 'music', 'catchy', 'tunes', 'helped', 'ton', 'children.The', 'last', 'ballet', 'scene', '17', 'minutes', 'quite', 'long', 'popular', 'movie', 'film', 'Hans', 'story', 'especially', 'love', 'Doro', 'unfortunately', 'Niels', 'cupboard', 'so', 'Andersen', 'never', 'perform', 'use', 'imagination.The', 'ballet', 'place', 'land', 'ocean', 'surface', 'waves', 'are', 'pop-up', 'dancers', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'dancing', 'swells', 'really', 'very', 'clever', 'visually', 'trickery', 'here', 'sea', 'filled', 'monsters', 'witches', 'heroine', 'probably', 'attached', 'pulley', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'swimming', 'surface', 'are', 'blue', 'screens', 'film', 'effects', 'are', 'up-front', 'work', 'perfectly', 'similar', 'staged', 'ballet', 'Once', 'again', 'technicolor', 'process', 'used', 'fairy', 'tale', 'effect', 'vivid', 'colors.Hans', 'Christian', 'Andersen', 'fairy', 'stories', 'are', 'not', 'violent', 'when', 'compared', 'Grimm', 'brothers', 'themes', 'usually', 'have', 'lesson', 'story', 'written', 'Doro', 'ballet', 'quot', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'quot', 'saying', 'aiming', 'stars', 'not', 'always', 'bring', 'happiness', 'then', 'course', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'had', ""n't"", 'yet', 'arrived', 'scene', 'soon', 'changed', 'philosophy']",Hans Christian Andersen VHS

At the beginning he is said by the schoolmaster of the village of Odense he is causing trouble. The trouble is he tells stories to the village children, and they learn things like numbers falling in love and marrying each other. One town person said of his stories: They asked their daughter what time it was? She said &quot;the minute and hour hands weren't speaking to each other. They were in love with the second hand. So they wouldn't make up until they met at 12 o' clock.&quot; After all the commotion with the village officials, Hans goes back to his cobbler shop. There his apprentice friend, Peter talks him into getting away from the village and going to Copenhagen.Reluctant at first Hans agrees to go to Copenhagen with Peter. There Hans meets and falls in love with Doro (Jeanmarie), a beautiful French ballerina. But later learns that she is married to the demanding Niels (Farley Granger). Overwhelmed by his love for her, he is inspired to write, 'The Little Mermaid' for Doro. The story of the Little Mermaid, like Doro goes-that she looked for love from the wrong man. Hans becomes popular with the people of Copenhagen and his gift in telling stories to the children. So Andersen's fame grew out of his plays and stories. Some of the musical scores that stand out are the most known of Andersen's best loved works. Those most memorable numbers are from 'Inchworm,' 'Thumbelina' and 'The Ugly Duckling.' Hans later finds that the ballerina truly loves her husband, so Hans returns home to his village of Odense. There he tells his stories to the children who loves to hear his fairy tales. You may not find Kaye's usual comic flair here. He extends his more poignant side of the famous storyteller. This was Kaye's final film of his career beofre embarking on his life's love of working with Unicef. If you like to read about Andersen, he wrote his auto-bio, 'The Fairy Tale of My Life.'

The film is unusual in the annals of movie musicals.  The focus is inconsistent.  Some sections clearly appeal to children, with Kaye charming as he interacts with assorted little ones, but because the movie romanticizes the life of Andersen, other sections are geared more to adults, particularly several ballet sequences.The son of a poor cobbler, Andersen failed as an actor and didn't find success until he moved to Copenhagen and won the patronage of the king with his poetry and stories. The Moss Hart screenplay and Kaye's interpretation portray Andersen as a far more agreeable chap than he was. He wasn't a happy man and never married, though he did develop an affection for opera soprano diva Jenny Lind. In the film, Andersen is fascinated not with the singer, but a ballet dancer (Zizi Jeanmaire).Composer-lyricist Frank Loesser had scored a triumph on Broadway two years earlier with ""Guys and Dolls,"" and his songs here are charming.  There are several delightful children's songs based on Andersen stories -- ""The Ugly Duckling,"" ""The King's New Clothes,"" and ""Thumbelina.""  There are also a rousing anthem by Andersen as he sets out for Denmark's capital, ""Wonderful Copenhagen,""  the love duet ""No Two People,"" and the soulful ballad ""Anywhere I Wander.""If you think of this film as a musical fantasy rather than as authentic biography, you will thoroughly enjoy it.  Danny Kaye is wonderful as the writer and balances humor with poignance and even lovesickness.  It's hard to imagine anyone else in the part.  Sadly, younger folks are not familiar with Kaye's movies these days.  ""Hans Christian Andersen"" is a terrific introduction to Kaye.
