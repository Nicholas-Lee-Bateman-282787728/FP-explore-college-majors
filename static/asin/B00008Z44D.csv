750766,A2FL0EKQ2EQ9E6,B00008Z44D,"a viewer ""a viewer""","[11, 14]","If you read the book ""The Crime of the Century"" written by the man who prosecuted Speck, you will find this terrible movie grossly inaccurate and a true insult to the memory of the eight young women whom Speck brutally murdered.  Whoever thought to make this film did so in very, very poor taste.  The film borders on the ridiculous and it is hopelessly inaccurate in most parts.  According to the book and to the testimonies from the trial, Speck told the women not to be afraid, that he wasn't going to kill them.  Yet, the way he is portrayed here it is evident that he wants them to know immediately that he is going to kill them!  He is brutal and forceful, not soft-spoken the way Cora Amurao described him.  What really bugs me is the way this film shortchanged us by the way the nurses were portrayed.  We see no interaction between them before the murders.  Also inaccurate is the way Corazon Amurao (the lone survivor) was portrayed.  The woman who portrayed her looks like her and did a wonderful job but they showed her as maneuvering herself downstairs to hide while Speck was killing the other women.  THAT IS NOT WHAT HAPPENED!!  Cora remained in the room with the other nurses and as the killings went on, each of the nurses tried to hide under beds or wherever else they could.  Cora hid herself under one bed but her head protruded, because she could not get all the way under.  Then, after Speck took Gloria Davy away downstairs after raping her, Cora, the only one left, maneuvered herself in her tied up condition to another bed in the room where she was concealed by a blanket that draped completely over the bed.  She stayed there and prayed Speck wouldn't find her (he didn't) and it wasn't until 5:00 o'clock the next morning that she was able to untie herself and drag herself out to the window on the second floor of the townhouse and scream for help.  At NO TIME did she go downstairs and hide the way it is portrayed in the film.  Another inaccuracy is that when she identified Speck in the hospital, Speck grabbed her arm and screamed at her.  That DID NOT HAPPEN.  She identified him but he was heavily sedated at the time and didn't even know she was there.  The casting of the other girls was quite terrible.  They did the best they could under the circumstances but the least they could have done was to cast girls who looked like the victims and done their hairstyles up to resemble the mid-sixties.  All in all this is a movie that should never have been made.  Those nurses suffered unspeakable horror at the hands of a madman and it was in very poor taste to bring this to a poorly executed film!",1,AN INSULT TO THE MEMORY OF THE NURSES!!!,1124582400,"08 21, 2005",2005,2634,"['read', 'book', 'Crime', 'Century', 'written', 'man', 'who', 'prosecuted', 'Speck', 'will', 'find', 'terrible', 'movie', 'grossly', 'inaccurate', 'true', 'insult', 'memory', 'eight', 'young', 'women', 'whom', 'Speck', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'Whoever', 'thought', 'make', 'film', 'did', 'so', 'very', 'very', 'poor', 'taste', 'film', 'borders', 'ridiculous', 'hopelessly', 'inaccurate', 'most', 'parts', 'According', 'book', 'testimonies', 'trial', 'Speck', 'told', 'women', 'not', 'be', 'afraid', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'kill', 'way', 'portrayed', 'here', 'evident', 'know', 'immediately', 'going', 'kill', 'brutal', 'forceful', 'not', 'soft-spoken', 'way', 'Cora', 'Amurao', 'described', 'What', 'really', 'bugs', 'way', 'film', 'shortchanged', 'way', 'nurses', 'were', 'portrayed', 'see', 'interaction', 'murders', 'Also', 'inaccurate', 'way', 'Corazon', 'Amurao', 'lone', 'survivor', 'was', 'portrayed', 'woman', 'who', 'portrayed', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'showed', 'maneuvering', 'downstairs', 'hide', 'Speck', 'was', 'killing', 'other', 'women', 'NOT', 'WHAT', 'HAPPENED', 'Cora', 'remained', 'room', 'other', 'nurses', 'killings', 'went', 'nurses', 'tried', 'hide', 'beds', 'wherever', 'else', 'could', 'Cora', 'hid', 'one', 'bed', 'head', 'protruded', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'way', 'Then', 'Speck', 'took', 'Gloria', 'Davy', 'away', 'raping', 'Cora', 'only', 'one', 'left', 'maneuvered', 'tied', 'up', 'condition', 'bed', 'room', 'where', 'was', 'concealed', 'blanket', 'draped', 'completely', 'bed', 'stayed', 'prayed', 'Speck', 'would', ""n't"", 'find', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', ""n't"", '5:00', 'next', 'morning', 'was', 'able', 'untie', 'drag', 'window', 'second', 'floor', 'townhouse', 'scream', 'help', 'TIME', 'did', 'go', 'downstairs', 'hide', 'way', 'portrayed', 'film', 'inaccuracy', 'when', 'identified', 'Speck', 'hospital', 'Speck', 'grabbed', 'arm', 'screamed', 'DID', 'NOT', 'HAPPEN', 'identified', 'was', 'heavily', 'sedated', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'was', 'there', 'casting', 'other', 'girls', 'was', 'quite', 'terrible', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'circumstances', 'least', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'was', 'cast', 'girls', 'who', 'looked', 'victims', 'done', 'hairstyles', 'resemble', 'mid-sixties', 'movie', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'nurses', 'suffered', 'unspeakable', 'horror', 'hands', 'madman', 'was', 'very', 'poor', 'taste', 'bring', 'poorly', 'executed', 'film']",Speck

I don't know if the lines in the movie were his own words, but they were thought-provoking nonetheless.  He said that killing was his nature, just like it was a poet's nature to write.

750770,A1YQ6QB2127AJ4,B00008Z44D,David Anderson,"[8, 8]","""Speck"", released on DVD in 2003, explores the mass murder that occurred in 1966.  This edition follows the series of films based on real-life serial killers including ""Dahmer"", ""Ted Bundy"", ""Ed Gein"", and ""The Hillside Strangler"".  However, the basis of this film, Richard Speck, wasn't a serial killer.  This true account desplicts all eight individual murders committed in the nursing school house.  The time it happened, no other mass murder reached or exceeded the severity since 1941 when 15 people were killed.  Meanwhile, the film also explores the motives of his crimes and his past committed crimes: rape, threatened murder, theft, harassment, and others.""Speck"" didn't explore Richard Speck's life very broadly as they should have.  Though the madness is fairly expressed, they didn't show much deep or specific details about events outside the massacre.  The film contained too many empty scenes should have added more action and terrorism through the characters.  They cause the intense scenes to loose their edge very quickly.  Since this film is about mass murder, they should have added more suspense.  Instead, every scene is predictable, even to those who have never researched this.The acting is average, though the lead actor who played Speck expressed some strengths as an actor, namely in the rage scenes.  He truly shows in his mannerisms and his face that Speck was truly dangerous.  However, those who played the victims could have expressed more terror.  It seems like they don't care as much as they should about dying suddenly.  They don't seem deathly scared like the actual victims surely were.  Had the actors dug deeper into their roles, this film could have contained the necessary emotional value.Those wanting to experience true terror through film should not watch ""Speck"".  This is not a film that will please many audiences.

750771,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B00008Z44D,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[3, 5]","SPECKAt first glance this seems like the all too typical low budget serial killer movie that seems popular today. But once you get to the back of the cover your hopes go up a little, the pics on the back make it seem like this will be a great independent film. Also instead of the typical synopsis on the back of the case, it is a newspaper article explaining the murders. But once you start the film you go back to your original thought of what the film will be, the typical low budget film. You see with this onslaught of based on true events serial killer films that are coming out they all fall in to one particular category or another. The ones like ""DAHMER, & NIGHTSTALKER"" are dark artistic portrayal of the killer, were ones like ""TED BUNDY, & THE HILLSIDE STRANGLER"" are just straight out pull no punches no holds barred films. Then the ones like ""GACY, & THE KILLER WITH IN ME"" are more of the guy next door scary type of feel with a little made for TV feeling. And of course you have ""ED GEIN & STARKWEATHER"" that are just great films that don't go all the way into one of the other categories creating one of their own.This film seems to want to make it to one of those levels but just doesn't make it to one. The atmosphere of the film makes it feel like the Bundy type as you can see these girls being chosen one by one for their rape and death. That element redeems this film from being out right predictable. But that lack of detail to the full story and its budget restraints [I guess], keep it from falling into the Dahmer category either. The atmosphere can also be credited from keeping this film from being in the Gacy range. And since the film isn't as good as Gein or Starkweather it falls into a lesser category. Not saying that the film isn't good because it is, it just doesn't hold up to the standards others have set. But like I said the film is in its own right is an entertaining picture none the less.The before mentioned heightened tension with the nurses just waiting to be killed makes this an interesting film, but the lack of scenes showing the actual murders tone down the fear you are supposed to share with the girls. And as far as acting goes DOUG COLE does do an excellent job with his role, his evil looks and cold hearted expressions make him perfect for this film. The girls on the other hand are only given roles in which for the most part they are tied up or screaming, so it wouldn't be fair to judge their acting abilities to the fullest. But for what they are given they all portray their characters well, the surviving girl in particular does a great job for the most part.You can tell producer/director KIETH WALLEY tried to make an honestly good film portraying this sick killer, and for what we got it is a good film. Writers AARON POPE & DON ADAMS could have added a little death scenes showing them killed into the script, but they made up for it with the scenes showing the girls waiting for execution. Over all this is a decent film hat has its moments, but fails to deliver like some of the other serial killer films.",3,"IT AIN'T THAT BAD, BUT IT ISN'T GREAT EITHER",1134432000,"12 13, 2005",2005,3075,"['SPECKAt', 'first', 'glance', 'too', 'typical', 'low', 'budget', 'serial', 'killer', 'movie', 'popular', 'today', 'once', 'get', 'back', 'cover', 'hopes', 'go', 'up', 'little', 'pics', 'back', 'make', 'seem', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'independent', 'film', 'Also', 'instead', 'typical', 'synopsis', 'back', 'case', 'newspaper', 'article', 'explaining', 'murders', 'once', 'start', 'film', 'go', 'back', 'original', 'thought', 'what', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'typical', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'see', 'onslaught', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'serial', 'killer', 'films', 'are', 'coming', 'fall', 'one', 'particular', 'category', 'ones', 'DAHMER', 'NIGHTSTALKER', 'are', 'dark', 'artistic', 'portrayal', 'killer', 'were', 'ones', 'TED', 'BUNDY', 'THE', 'HILLSIDE', 'STRANGLER', 'are', 'just', 'straight', 'out', 'pull', 'punches', 'barred', 'films', 'Then', 'ones', 'GACY', 'THE', 'KILLER', 'WITH', 'IN', 'ME', 'are', 'more', 'guy', 'next', 'door', 'scary', 'type', 'feel', 'little', 'made', 'TV', 'feeling', 'course', 'have', 'ED', 'GEIN', 'STARKWEATHER', 'are', 'just', 'great', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'way', 'one', 'other', 'categories', 'creating', 'one', 'own.This', 'film', 'want', 'make', 'one', 'levels', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'one', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'feel', 'Bundy', 'type', 'can', 'see', 'girls', 'being', 'chosen', 'one', 'one', 'rape', 'death', 'element', 'film', 'being', 'out', 'right', 'predictable', 'lack', 'detail', 'full', 'story', 'budget', 'restraints', '[', 'guess', ']', 'keep', 'falling', 'Dahmer', 'category', 'either', 'atmosphere', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'credited', 'keeping', 'film', 'being', 'Gacy', 'range', 'film', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'Gein', 'Starkweather', 'lesser', 'category', 'Not', 'saying', 'film', ""n't"", 'good', 'just', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'standards', 'others', 'have', 'set', 'said', 'film', 'own', 'right', 'entertaining', 'picture', 'none', 'less.The', 'before', 'mentioned', 'heightened', 'tension', 'nurses', 'just', 'waiting', 'be', 'killed', 'interesting', 'film', 'lack', 'scenes', 'showing', 'actual', 'murders', 'tone', 'fear', 'are', 'supposed', 'share', 'girls', 'as', 'far', 'acting', 'DOUG', 'COLE', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'role', 'evil', 'looks', 'cold', 'hearted', 'expressions', 'make', 'perfect', 'film', 'girls', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'only', 'given', 'roles', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'tied', 'up', 'screaming', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'fair', 'judge', 'acting', 'abilities', 'fullest', 'what', 'are', 'given', 'portray', 'characters', 'well', 'surviving', 'girl', 'particular', 'great', 'job', 'most', 'part.You', 'can', 'tell', 'producer/director', 'KIETH', 'WALLEY', 'tried', 'make', 'honestly', 'good', 'film', 'portraying', 'sick', 'killer', 'what', 'got', 'good', 'film', 'Writers', 'AARON', 'POPE', 'DON', 'ADAMS', 'could', 'have', 'added', 'little', 'death', 'scenes', 'showing', 'killed', 'script', 'made', 'up', 'scenes', 'showing', 'girls', 'waiting', 'execution', 'decent', 'film', 'hat', 'moments', 'deliver', 'other', 'serial', 'killer', 'films']",Speck

This movie brings you right into the heart of the action. Which, in most movies cases, is not a bad thing; However, This movie really doesn't explain his history: How he had over 30 arrests prior to this incident (which is how the police had his finger prints to begin with). The movie also leaves you to believe what he really did to the victims, and doesn't show how bad he really was. (of course, no movie ever will show that, in reality there was eye gouging, and, trying to keep it as clean as possible: torture using unknown instruments in certain parts of the body the would really hurt!!) The movie also doesn't give specifics on his capture. A bungled up suicide leads to his capture but it doesn't say if he turned himself in, or if in fact someone found him. The movie finally mentions details of his fate in prison, but does not mention the video tapes later found by the media, and Richards new found breasts due to hormone pills, and his confession and no remorse for the murders he committed.Anyway, excluding the missed facts, the only other things I could say about the movie: It was better than I thought - the back looked very generic, and it is a no-name movie company. Don't get me wrong, you can tell it is low budget, but I have seen much worse. They also have an advertisement on the DVD for another movie from this company, and it looked really generic, so I was pleased with what I had. Only other complaints were minor production\editing problems. They try to make the movie ""creepy"" by using a ""dreamy/drugged out"" view, ex: like the killer talking slow, walking slow, the movie moving slow at times. After awhile I thought it was overdone. Also, in reality (however I could have my facts wrong on this) I thought he only changed his outfit/cleaned up once during the killings, in this movie he cleans up after every victim and talks to himself in the mirror, which after awhile gets old. final verdict: not bad at all, but not mind blowing either.
