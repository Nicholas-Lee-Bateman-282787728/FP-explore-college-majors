1022183,A24PTVSZSM8968,B000IONJEM,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","This movie reminds me a of a low-budget TV movie. Some of the acting is a little cheesy. The sets are pretty basic and there's no action or special effects. In spite of this, it is a nice watchable movie. This is a story of a guy who has an undercover business helping guys get their girlfriends back by romancing the girlfriends and then doing something that makes the former boyfriend look good in comparison. The first part of the movie is a montage of previous &#34;jobs&#34; and is a bit tacky. The main story line revolves around the latest job. A desperate-looking guy offers to double the fee. Mr. Fix It agrees because he needs the money to refurbish a car he wants to enter into a race. At first the girl seems to rebuff him at every turn but eventually they develop a lot of chemistry and have some really nice scenes. There are a couple of secondary plot lines that are not terribly consequential but are decently-done. You kind of have an idea that he's going to end up falling for the girl but there is something of a surprise twist at the end that leaves you with a nice feeling. In any case, this is not a slick Hollywood romantic comedy but it is a nice film with some interesting actors who have decent chemistry. If you like low-key romantic comedies, you should check this one out.",4,Nice little movie,1403049600,"06 18, 2014",2014,1301,"['movie', 'low-budget', 'TV', 'movie', 'acting', 'little', 'cheesy', 'sets', 'are', 'pretty', 'basic', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'spite', 'nice', 'watchable', 'movie', 'story', 'guy', 'who', 'undercover', 'business', 'helping', 'guys', 'get', 'girlfriends', 'back', 'romancing', 'girlfriends', 'then', 'doing', 'something', 'former', 'boyfriend', 'look', 'good', 'comparison', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'montage', 'previous', '34', 'jobs', '34', 'bit', 'tacky', 'main', 'story', 'line', 'latest', 'job', 'desperate-looking', 'guy', 'offers', 'double', 'fee', 'Mr', 'Fix', 'money', 'refurbish', 'car', 'enter', 'race', 'first', 'girl', 'rebuff', 'turn', 'eventually', 'develop', 'lot', 'chemistry', 'have', 'really', 'nice', 'scenes', 'are', 'couple', 'secondary', 'plot', 'lines', 'are', 'not', 'terribly', 'consequential', 'are', 'decently-done', 'kind', 'have', 'idea', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'falling', 'girl', 'something', 'surprise', 'twist', 'end', 'nice', 'feeling', 'case', 'not', 'slick', 'Hollywood', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'nice', 'film', 'interesting', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'decent', 'chemistry', 'like', 'low-key', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'should', 'check', 'one', 'out']",N/A

If, however, you need an occasional quick fix for the romantic and comedic verging on silly, then this is the movie for you.David Boreanaz, who plays Booth on BONES, is the lead.  He dates women who have just broken up with their boyfriends.  Their boyfriends hire him to make them look like the dream come true in comparison.  He at first seems perfect on these dates and then turns into a total nightmare. The women then go rushing back to their boyfriends.  This is his business and it is called Mr. Fix It.Alana De La Garza is the female lead, the woman who threatens to undo his whole Mr. Fix It gig.  She played the female attorney on ""Law&Order;"" in its final years. David Boreanaz is very good at comedy which he has used to good advantage in BONES.  I'd like to see him paired up with his Dean Martin as he can be a very good Jerry Lewis at times.  With the right comedic partner in the movies, he could hit a winning combination, as he has done on tv.
