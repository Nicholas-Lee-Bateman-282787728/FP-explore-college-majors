1669659,A2XXBZPQT5EXHV,B00EYA6V3C,Darren O'Neill,"[21, 22]","From the very start of this release you know it is something special.  It begins on-stage, there's a small wooden nightstand center stage and a stage-hand carries out a very large chair that looks like a king's throne.  He exits the stage and moments later comes back again to retrieve the chair.  He then comes out with a smaller, but still decently sized stuffed chair and once again leaves the stage.  He returns, retrieves the chair and then brings out a wooden dining room style chair.  One last time he returns to the stage, retrieves that chair and finally comes out with a folding chair, showing his displeasure with having to move all of these chairs he doesn't even open it, instead he just tosses it on the ground and leaves the stage.Only after this little scene does Bill Cosby hit the stage.  The opening is pure genius, without saying a word and without having to have Cosby himself on the stage the tone of the night is set.  Cosby doesn't see himself as a king that needs a throne or even a guy that needs a big comfy chair.  He shows us in his unique way that he is perfectly fine sitting on a folding chair just like each and every one of us in the audience would be fine with such an arrangement.The ""regular guy"" tone is indeed what Cosby's performance brings to life.  He talks about relationships, marriage, his children and his friends.  He is still one of the best storytellers alive and here on ""Far From Finished"" we see that in full force.  Sure, he's a bit older, but his wit has not slowed down and he is still using facial expressions to say more than some comics can say with a dictionary full of words.Both of my parents are in Cosby's age-range so his bits on the difference between a girlfriend and a wife and then about being married for years and years really hit home.  Bill Cosby has the knack to take ordinary things and make them special.  He had me laughing throughout this 90-minute show and not once did he utter a profane word.Overall I'd highly recommend seeing this Cosby special no matter how old or young you are.

Anyone who has been involved in a close marital situation will be able to relate to Cosby's take.It begins with the infatuation phase when a delusional state exists and &#34;the other&#34; is viewed quite unrealistically as existing near nirvana. It evolves to reality when (in this case) the husband begins to see his wife as &#34;she who must be obeyed&#34; and the constant critic always to be wary of.He sits throughout the entire monologue though he is quite mobile -- waving his arms and moving his head. His usual slow delivery (which almost always annoys me) works well this time.This about 90 minute performance is, in truth, a story that works for both men and women. If you have been in a close relationship or married, you will recognize yourself and mate in this brilliant performance.I originally viewed this on Comedy Central -- but realized that it had been edited. So, I bought it for this reason and also this comedic DVD has so much truth in it -- I wanted to keep it whole for posterity.Absolutely brilliant. Sometimes telling the truth is dangerous.

She is no longer his friend, although she wants him to call her that. She is now his boss, and his best way of handling it is to remain silent. There are many vignettes within the story, such as the time his house alarm goes off, his wife is not home, and he cannot remember his code, so he calls his wife for help. Another good one, among many, is when he returns from a trip, is driving home, when his car stops working. He calls his wife asking to be picked up.

1669675,A2DLZV94K1UPIP,B00EYA6V3C,"Justin Sosa ""Justin""","[1, 2]","&#34;Bill Cosby...Far From Finished&#34; comes as a fitting end to the Bill Cosby Standup Trilogy.  The first installment being the infamous 1983 release &#34;Bill Cosby, Himself&#34; that is undeniably one of the best examples of stand up comedy there is and the other being a not so well known and never mentioned nor ever released on DVD special from 1987 called &#34;49.&#34;  It is widely available on YouTube---I suggest you check it out.When you look at all 3 of these specials you see how much they all tie together.  Cosby in each of these specials discusses topics that are important to him at that particular time.  In &#34;Himself&#34; he talks about childhood, his parents, life, marriage and having children.  In &#34;49&#34; he discusses reaching middle age and the trials of getting older even though you're young at heart.  And here in &#34;Far From Finished&#34; he celebrates life as seen by someone in their seventies.  Life changes as we get older and The Cos is the perfect person to guide us through it all.Everyone is focused on how clean the comedy is and while that is definitely something that should be noted--the one factor people should really take note is just how amazingly crisp Bill Cosby's comedy still is today in 2013.  The guy has been at this for more than 50 years---and it would be an understatement to say that he &#34;knows what he's doing.&#34;  Yes he does but he's also doing what very few other people are doing.Bill Cosby's comedy style is radically different from many other popular comedians.  His comedy does not consist of quick one-liners that he rattles off one after the other.  Listening to Bill Cosby is like watching a beautiful sunset...there is no rush to get it over with--instead you sit and enjoy the beautiful sight in front of you.  Cosby's comedy pieces are long, incredibly detailed and very well organized.  The pacing is slower than most comedy specials because Cosby's comedy demands it.  He's a master weaver of story and as a storyteller, he takes care of his audience.  The audience is right there with him and that makes for an incredibly personal connection.They filmed two shows for this DVD.  I attended the 3pm taping earlier that day and from what I can see, most if not all of the material on this DVD/BluRay comes entirely from the 7pm taping later that day.  Two completely different sets.  Any other comedian would have said &#34;Well, let me do my same set twice...so if there's anything I missed or flubbed at the 3pm show...we can grab from the 7pm show to edit together&#34;  Not Cosby.  The 3pm show was nothing like the performance on this DVD from the 7pm show. This guy is such a pro that it boggles the mind how he's able to do this all so effortlessly.This special is hilarious and for any students of comedy: incredibly educational.  You're watching a master at work here.
