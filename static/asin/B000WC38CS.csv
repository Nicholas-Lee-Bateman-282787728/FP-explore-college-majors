They are human, they sweat and miss a step just like every other human. Rather comforting. Just like some of her other DVDs she has a workout meter to tell you when you have done one mile, two miles, and three miles. That makes it easy to pick and choose how far you want to go. If you need a mini workout then do a mile and then skip to the cool down.The only downside FOR ME is how much Leslie talks in this one.

1107946,A3NK6P0QFDUZL2,B000WC38CS,G. Charles Steiner,"[20, 20]","This is a terrific exercise DVD.  This exciting program is a 45-minute, 3-mile walk set to the pace of five (5) miles an hour.The opening menu states that you can choose a full workout, or you can choose to do a one-mile, do a two- mile or do a three-mile workout, but the menu is misleading.  If you choose the ""3 mile,"" you walk just one mile and that mile is set at a near-cool-down pace.  If you choose the first file, ""one mile"" or ""two mile,"" the second file, you still only do one mile each, respectively, and in the ""two mile"" set, it's a walk set at the fastest pace possible, with no warm-up at all.  Thus, it's best just to do the full workout, which is a full 3 miles (but no more than 3) and forget about the other ""choices.""  The whole work out definitely will make you sweat but all the while you will not injure, strain, exhaust or defeat yourself.  You will get an invigorating workout experience.What's particularly wonderful about this DVD is the music.  A lot of it is reminiscent of the great gay period of high disco from the 1970s; in other moments, the music simply rocks, and sisters and seniors (or whoever else wants to join in)-- in sweat -- can wig out and get down as much as they please.  The music is fast-paced, motivating, and wholly distracting so that not only do your limbs fly but time flies as well.There are only women in this exercise program, and they each represent a certain body-type or age-type.  All are inspiring, as is Leslie Sansone herself, even if you are not a woman.This near-60-year-old exerciser has two other Leslie Sansone programs that he uses -- a 4-mile walk program and a 5-mile fast walk program, and while all are likeable, of  the three, this ""Walk Away Your Waistline!"" is the most satisfying because the most wholly enjoyable.  (P.S.:  The walk-belt is a real plus, but if you're larger than a size 42"" waist, you won't be able to wear it.  It's not stretchable.  However, there's only one exercise in the entire program that really requires that the belt be anchored around the waist.  You can go ahead and get this video and the belt if you want to use the belt without it closing around the waist.  One also can substitute an exercise band or ""stretchie"" for the belt -- or one can add an extra piece of velcro for the expanded waist since the belt get cinched with velcro.)",5,"Seniors in Sweat, Sisters in Sweat - Wig Out!",1244419200,"06 8, 2009",2009,2344,"['terrific', 'exercise', 'DVD', 'exciting', 'program', '45-minute', '3-mile', 'walk', 'set', 'pace', 'five', '5', 'miles', 'hour.The', 'opening', 'menu', 'can', 'choose', 'full', 'workout', 'can', 'choose', 'do', 'one-mile', 'do', 'two-', 'mile', 'do', 'three-mile', 'workout', 'menu', 'misleading', 'choose', '3', 'mile', 'walk', 'just', 'one', 'mile', 'mile', 'set', 'near-cool-down', 'pace', 'choose', 'first', 'file', 'one', 'mile', 'two', 'mile', 'second', 'file', 'still', 'only', 'do', 'one', 'mile', 'respectively', 'two', 'mile', 'set', 'walk', 'set', 'fastest', 'pace', 'possible', 'warm-up', 'Thus', 'best', 'just', 'do', 'full', 'workout', 'full', '3', 'miles', 'more', '3', 'forget', 'other', 'choices', 'whole', 'work', 'out', 'definitely', 'will', 'make', 'sweat', 'while', 'will', 'not', 'injure', 'strain', 'exhaust', 'defeat', 'will', 'get', 'invigorating', 'workout', 'experience.What', 'particularly', 'wonderful', 'DVD', 'music', 'lot', 'reminiscent', 'great', 'gay', 'period', 'high', 'disco', '1970s', 'other', 'moments', 'music', 'simply', 'sisters', 'seniors', 'whoever', 'else', 'join', 'sweat', 'can', 'wig', 'out', 'get', 'down', 'as', 'much', 'please', 'music', 'fast-paced', 'motivating', 'wholly', 'distracting', 'so', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'limbs', 'fly', 'time', 'flies', 'are', 'only', 'women', 'exercise', 'program', 'represent', 'certain', 'body-type', 'age-type', 'are', 'inspiring', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'even', 'are', 'not', 'woman.This', 'near-60-year-old', 'exerciser', 'two', 'other', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'programs', '4-mile', 'walk', 'program', '5-mile', 'fast', 'walk', 'program', 'are', 'likeable', 'three', 'Walk', 'Away', 'Waistline', 'most', 'satisfying', 'most', 'wholly', 'enjoyable', 'P.S', 'walk-belt', 'real', 'plus', ""'re"", 'larger', 'size', '42', 'waist', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'wear', 'not', 'stretchable', 'However', 'only', 'one', 'exercise', 'entire', 'program', 'really', 'belt', 'be', 'anchored', 'waist', 'can', 'go', 'ahead', 'get', 'video', 'belt', 'want', 'use', 'belt', 'closing', 'waist', 'One', 'also', 'can', 'substitute', 'exercise', 'band', 'stretchie', 'belt', 'one', 'can', 'add', 'extra', 'piece', 'velcro', 'expanded', 'waist', 'belt', 'get', 'cinched', 'velcro']",Leslie Sansone: Walk at Home: Walk Away Your Waistline!

Leslie makes it fun to workout with her. Although we love Leslie, sometimes you need to mute the little Darling so you can focus. Nonetheless, she's a wealth of information. In the beginning try not to mute often because you might miss out on the tips, coaching, info and her postive spiritual attitude about life. I've worked out w/ others and felt like I was in the military, worked out with them for a month and quit.

1107953,A27HI0UHKSKMZ7,B000WC38CS,"Karen B. Huber ""kbh32""","[2, 2]","I bought this video just recently and it is one of Leslie's better workouts. It comes with a workout belt meant to increase the intensity of the workout and exercise the arms. The belt does increase the intensity a bit and adds variety to the workout. It comes as adjustable so anyone can wear it. It is plastic and so, is good for light action.What I really liked about this workout was that the transitions to different steps and different sections was smooth and continuous, some walking, then a new step right away.  Leslie still has fun in this workout, talking and laughing, but seems more in tune with the steps. I also liked the music in the workout. The arm exercises with the belt are used at intervals throughout the video and the slowdown walk starts early in the third mile. There are also new people in the workout, which I also enjoyed.Leslie introduces the basic steps at the beginning of the workout, then uses those, some kickbacks, and walking sidesteps to add variety.  I liked that the walking and other steps got about equal time in this video. In other videos, Leslie will keep going with just one step while she talks; she forgets to change steps while she is talking.Leslie Sansone: Walk at Home: Walk Away Your Waistline!",5,A well-put-together workout!,1298937600,"03 1, 2011",2011,1247,"['bought', 'video', 'just', 'recently', 'one', 'Leslie', 'better', 'workouts', 'workout', 'belt', 'meant', 'increase', 'intensity', 'workout', 'exercise', 'arms', 'belt', 'increase', 'intensity', 'bit', 'variety', 'workout', 'as', 'adjustable', 'anyone', 'can', 'wear', 'plastic', 'so', 'good', 'light', 'action.What', 'really', 'liked', 'workout', 'was', 'transitions', 'different', 'steps', 'different', 'sections', 'was', 'smooth', 'continuous', 'walking', 'then', 'new', 'step', 'right', 'away', 'Leslie', 'still', 'fun', 'workout', 'talking', 'laughing', 'more', 'tune', 'steps', 'also', 'liked', 'music', 'workout', 'arm', 'belt', 'are', 'used', 'intervals', 'video', 'slowdown', 'walk', 'early', 'third', 'mile', 'are', 'also', 'new', 'people', 'workout', 'also', 'enjoyed.Leslie', 'basic', 'steps', 'beginning', 'workout', 'then', 'kickbacks', 'walking', 'sidesteps', 'add', 'variety', 'liked', 'walking', 'other', 'steps', 'got', 'equal', 'time', 'video', 'other', 'videos', 'Leslie', 'will', 'keep', 'going', 'just', 'one', 'step', 'change', 'steps', 'talking.Leslie', 'Sansone', 'Walk', 'Home', 'Walk', 'Away', 'Waistline']",Leslie Sansone: Walk at Home: Walk Away Your Waistline!

Leslie uses the belt in other workouts so it is worth buying in this set. I think once you start doing this workout you will want to go for all three miles.

Probably the best and most favorite piece of equipment I own other than my collection of Leslie Sansone DVDs. The triceps move she uses during the workout has already helped with my underarm jiggle. I didn't think I could ever get rid of that. My core feels so much stronger. I am 5'3"" but feel so tall and fit. This has done in a  couple of weeks what months of yoga did not do. I have renewed confidence and self esteem. Thank you Leslie.",5,Such a small little thing for such big results!!!,1361318400,"02 20, 2013",2013,751,"['When', 'removed', 'belt', 'box', 'thought', 'had', 'wasted', 'money', 'Absolutely', 'not', 'felt', 'results', 'first', 'use', 'great', 'posture', 'workouts', 'alternate', 'days', 'sculpting', 'arms', 'working', 'waistline', 'have', 'lost', 'incredible', 'amount', 'inches', 'firmed', 'toned', 'only', 'week', 'Probably', 'best', 'most', 'favorite', 'piece', 'equipment', 'own', 'other', 'collection', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'DVDs', 'triceps', 'move', 'workout', 'already', 'helped', 'underarm', 'jiggle', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'ever', 'get', 'rid', 'core', 'feels', 'so', 'much', 'stronger', 'am', '5', '3', 'feel', 'so', 'tall', 'fit', 'done', 'couple', 'weeks', 'what', 'months', 'yoga', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'have', 'renewed', 'confidence', 'self', 'esteem', 'Thank', 'Leslie']",Leslie Sansone: Walk at Home: Walk Away Your Waistline!

The belt adds a lot of intensity to the workout and the 45 minute workout is a real challenge. Didn't like the soundtrack too much, but other than that, it's pretty good.I also liked that you get to choose if you want to do 1, mile, 2 miles or 3 miles. Although you don't get to use the be;t much in the first mile. If you want to really use the belt then I suggest you do at least 2 miles.I love that the DVD is so easy to follow even for someone like me who has 2 left feet.

They are all the most user friendly and realisitic programs out there. The results are fabulous and Leslie makes it fun! Each new series she creates incorporates all the newest information in exercise physiology and is just plain fun! I recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to head to a gym, can't walk outdoors, and is just looking for a program that gets you moving without it being necessary to be a &#34;dancer&#34;, an athlete, or in boot camp. I have tried many others and always return to my Leslie! The belt in this program really gives you a workout without being overly taxing on joints.
