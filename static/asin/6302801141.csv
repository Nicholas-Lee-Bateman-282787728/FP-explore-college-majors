336879,AQCAWDBNNUS1E,6302801141,A. J. Sneed,"[1, 3]","Although some claim that this film was the first screwball comedy, it has faded into relative obscurity and I would say with some justification. While there are some very funny moments ( amply supplied by the leads and supporting cast), and the film is generally amusing there are at least a dozen ""screwballs"" that I would recommend over this one.I think Twentieth Century is mostly memorable for the top talent: from writers, director, leads and supporting cast; and for the fact that this was Carole Lombard's breakout film. And while it may or may not be the first screwball comedy, you can easily see the basic elements of the genre in this film.Lombard and Barrymore are hamming it up as a ""genius"" director who turns a no-talent lingerie model into a successful theater actress. They have a string of theater hits together, and become romantically entwined. But they find  they cant live with each other, at least not without high drama, and they separate ... the plot revolves around their getting back together. This is all played as farce and comes off pretty well. Although I  think the overacting of Barrymore and Lombard might be a little too much for modern tastes.The film parodies theatrical people and the theater in general, and of course Hollywood by extension since so many from the New York theater establishment ( writers , actors, musicians, etc) were going out to Hollywood in droves at this time. (Interesting that Lombard's character goes out to Hollywood after leaving Barrymore and the theater).While we have the ingredients for a good comedy, even a ""screwball"", I don't believe they come together so well. We have the snappy lines and wit, the goofy characters, ridiculous mishaps;  but the pace seems very slow at times as the movie becomes too busy with subplots and running gags. Or perhaps it is the chemistry between the male and female leads that is lacking in Twentieth Century. There is nothing very appealing about Barrymore's character in a romantic way. He is all conniving and self absorbed. Lombard's Lilli Garland becomes all diva without anything  to compensate. The zaniness and peculiarity of these characters seems to overwhelm any charm that would make them very likeable.Hawks gets it just right in a few years with ""Bringing Up Baby"" and ""His Girl Friday"", two movies that leave this one far behind in their polish and craftsmanship. Nevertheless this film is worth viewing, particularly to see how Hawks and Lombard went on to so much success by developing many of the basic elements of this film. And it is a fun movie. However, Twentieth Century is just a warm-up for both of them. Even Barrymore who would soon be unable to deliver lines without cue cards due to alcoholism would go on to more memorable  performances in ""Dinner at Eight"" and ""Midnight"".",3,Doesnt hold up to Hawks' classic comedies,1296345600,"01 30, 2011",2011,2809,"['claim', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'faded', 'relative', 'obscurity', 'would', 'say', 'justification', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'amply', 'supplied', 'leads', 'supporting', 'cast', 'film', 'generally', 'amusing', 'are', 'least', 'dozen', 'screwballs', 'would', 'recommend', 'one.I', 'think', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'mostly', 'memorable', 'top', 'talent', 'writers', 'director', 'supporting', 'cast', 'fact', 'was', 'Carole', 'Lombard', 'breakout', 'film', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'first', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'basic', 'elements', 'genre', 'film.Lombard', 'Barrymore', 'are', 'hamming', 'up', 'genius', 'director', 'who', 'no-talent', 'lingerie', 'model', 'successful', 'theater', 'actress', 'have', 'string', 'theater', 'hits', 'together', 'become', 'romantically', 'entwined', 'find', 'cant', 'live', 'other', 'least', 'not', 'high', 'drama', 'separate', 'plot', 'getting', 'back', 'together', 'played', 'farce', 'off', 'pretty', 'well', 'think', 'overacting', 'Barrymore', 'Lombard', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'modern', 'tastes.The', 'film', 'parodies', 'theatrical', 'people', 'theater', 'general', 'course', 'Hollywood', 'extension', 'so', 'many', 'New', 'York', 'theater', 'establishment', 'writers', 'actors', 'musicians', 'etc', 'were', 'going', 'Hollywood', 'droves', 'time', 'Interesting', 'Lombard', 'character', 'out', 'Hollywood', 'leaving', 'Barrymore', 'theater', 'have', 'ingredients', 'good', 'comedy', 'even', 'screwball', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'come', 'together', 'so', 'well', 'have', 'snappy', 'lines', 'wit', 'goofy', 'characters', 'ridiculous', 'mishaps', 'pace', 'very', 'slow', 'times', 'movie', 'too', 'busy', 'subplots', 'running', 'gags', 'perhaps', 'chemistry', 'male', 'female', 'leads', 'lacking', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'nothing', 'very', 'appealing', 'Barrymore', 'character', 'romantic', 'way', 'conniving', 'self', 'absorbed', 'Lombard', 'Lilli', 'Garland', 'diva', 'anything', 'compensate', 'zaniness', 'peculiarity', 'characters', 'overwhelm', 'charm', 'would', 'make', 'very', 'likeable.Hawks', 'just', 'right', 'few', 'years', 'Bringing', 'Up', 'Baby', 'Girl', 'Friday', 'two', 'movies', 'leave', 'one', 'far', 'polish', 'craftsmanship', 'Nevertheless', 'film', 'worth', 'viewing', 'particularly', 'see', 'how', 'Hawks', 'Lombard', 'went', 'so', 'much', 'success', 'developing', 'many', 'basic', 'elements', 'film', 'fun', 'movie', 'However', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'just', 'warm-up', 'Even', 'who', 'would', 'soon', 'be', 'unable', 'deliver', 'lines', 'cue', 'cards', 'due', 'alcoholism', 'would', 'go', 'more', 'memorable', 'performances', 'Dinner', 'Eight', 'Midnight']",N/A

John Barrymore, with some help from Carole Lombard, stayed upright long enough to give one more great performance on film. He's a producer with an ego bigger than the Great White Way and she's a lingere model he molds into the toast of Broadway.Once she becomes a huge star, however, she wants to live it up rather than sit around and discuss his genius. His hilariously insane jealousy drives her to Hollywood where she becomes the biggest thing in pictures. Meanwhile, he has flop after flop but retains his volatile temperment and ego. Broke and running from creditors, he and his put upon backer Webb (Walter Connolly) take the 20th Century Limited and who should be on the train but Lily Garland (Lombard).But she now has an ego nearly as big as his and is nearly as big a ham! The script from Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur shines as they thrust and parry towards the inevitable. While the film does suffer just a bit from lack of a likable and normal lead character usually found in most screwball comedies, it still survives as a terrific example of the genre.Barrymore has one last hurrah and Lombard isn't just in fabulous form, but her fabulous form is shown to breathtaking advantage as Hawks has her constantly adorned in satin evening dress or lingere.

The train is also filled with other weird characters, including a religious fanatic with delusions of wealth and two bearded guys who hope to get into one of Barrymore's plays.

Popular later in the 30's because the manic pace of the comedy could make up for the lack of realism due to the imposition of the production code in mid-1934, this film is one of the rare screwball comedies made before the code began to be enforced. John Barrymore shows that besides being a great serious actor he was terrific at physical comedy as well. He even manages to comically jab at some of his own serious performances, such as when Carole Lombard calls him ""Svengali"", a part which he played in an earlier Warner Brothers film. Carole Lombard hasn't quite reached the peak of her powers yet though, and she comes off as overacting. I just can't figure where some of her screaming is coming from and what or who exactly it is supposed to be directed at.There is some great comic support in the person of Walter Connally whom Barrymore's Oscar Jaffe is constantly firing and rehiring. The best light touch is in the person of fellow passenger on the ""Twentieth Century"", Matthew Clark. He goes around the train putting up signs that say ""Repent the end is at hand"" and also likes writing large checks for which he has no cash reserves. He ends up figuring into the final plot twist in a big way.One odd thing that has come up in other films from the 30's that also comes up in this one is that apparently people could be arrested and jailed for bad debts. At the height of the depression, credit was very hard to come by and you would basically have to lie to get into debt and be unable to repay, thus the criminal offense. Very different from today's situation.At any rate, I own this one and after seeing the much clearer presentation on TCM several times, I feel somewhat taken by my purchase. Apparently the good people at TCM could be bothered to present a much clearer transfer than the film's rightful owner, Sony, ended up selling to the public.

DeRiemer,"[10, 10]","""Now don't be nervous, child,"" says impresario Oscar Jaffe (John Barrymore) during rehearsals to Mildred Plotka (Carole Lombard), a New Jersey shopgirl he's just renamed Lily Garland and thrust into the starring role of Mary Jo Calhoun in Heart of Kentucky. ""You're not Lily Garland anymore. You're little Mary Jo Calhoun. The scent of jasmine is floating through the open window of a summer evening. You've just kissed your lover goodnight.

Then Jaffe makes the mistake one day of tapping her phone to make sure she doesn't stray. Before you can say ""ham"" Lily is in revolt and on her way to Hollywood by herself. She becomes a huge film star. And Oscar? It's flop after flop without Lily...until by chance they find themselves in adjoining staterooms on the Twentieth Century traveling from Chicago to New York. Can Oscar convince (or trick) Lily into signing a contract with him? Can Lily forgive Oscar? Will the ""Repent for the time is at hand"" stickers ever come off Oliver Webb's derby? Will Jaffe find the camels, the elephants, the sand for his Obermangau smash he's planning to have Lily star in as Mary Magdalene? Was there ever a faster, funnier and hammier screwball comedy than Twentieth Century?John Barrymore was a great actor. He also could be a great ham. The two come together here in his amazingly funny, ripe melodramatic performance. He pulls out all stops, clutching his heart, staggering against a door, even picking his nose. When he lowers his eyebrows and glares, it's 100 per cent Smithfield. The screenplay by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur gives him some great, self-involved dialogue. Catching Lily kissing her fiance, he dramatically roars at her, ""This is the final irony -- mousing around with boys after Oscar Jaffe!"" Carole Lombard just about matches him toe to toe. The end of the movie, by the way, is as amusing as the start.Key elements in the success of the movie are the character parts: Walter Connolly as Oliver Webb, Jaffe's business manager, always being fired, always making some terrible misjudgment; Roscoe Karnes as Owen O'Malley, Jaffe's press agent, wise-cracking and drunk; Etienne Girardot as an elderly religious zealot plastering repent stickers on windows, hats and people's backs, and writing bum checks. Howard Hawks directs with a fast and furious hand.

She plays Lily (nee Mildred Plotka) who starts out as a talented amateur who is molded into a star by Oscar Joffe, a director and impressario type played by John Barrymore. Barrymore, a great screen actor who excelled in Shakespeare on the stage, was at the start of a long and painful decline that was accentuated by his love of alcohol and the toll it took on his once handsome appearance. The curious thing about this film is that Barrymore (and his poor pickled liver)  was able to not only perform comedy but perform it well enough to offset Lombard who was already well known as a screen beauty and talented comedienne. As they embark on a cross country oddysey on the 20th Century Limited, the two duke it out with great vigor as they agree to battle with one another verbally and physically with hilarious effect.The plot is screwy and probably less relevant than it  would appear as the creator and his muse choose to disagree.The comedic timing in this film is superb as Lombard vamps it up as the diva and Barrymore plays the teacher while parodying aspects of his real life situation.This is a great film to watch if you like comedy and a sublime treat if you want to see two really great actors play off one another. For Lombard alone, this is 5* worthy and Barrymore is a bonus.

336889,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6302801141,Dr. James Gardner,"[1, 2]","""Twentieth Century"" is a tour d'force for John Barrymore and Carol Lombard. The film is based on a successful 1932 Ben Hecht/Charles MacArthur play by the same name, which was a tongue in cheek look at famed Broadway impresario David Belasco. The action takes place on 2 main sets - the stage and on board a train. Barrymore plays the Svengali to Lombard's Trilby, and no one hams it up more or better than Barrymore. Yet translated to the big screen, Barrymore and Lombard's theatrics appear ""larger than life"" and slightly ""over the top."" If you imagine that you are watching the filming of a play, their exaggerated mannerisms, expressions, and vocals seem more natural.Barrymore (1882-1942), of course, was one of the greatest theatric performers of the 20th century, and we get a taste of what a treat the theatre-going audiences must have had when they saw Barrymore live. Many of his other screen performances are not nearly as powerful.Carole Lombard (1908-42) was one of the best comediennes of the mid 20th century, her talented life cut short at 33 during a USO tour in WW 2. She followed ""Twentieth Century"" with ""Bolero"" with George Raft and then did ""My Man Godfrey"" (1936) for which she received an Oscar nomination. At this time she was the Queen of screwball comedies.Roscoe Karns (1891-1970) wanders through the film in a perpetually drunk state. Karns appeared in more than 100 films, often as the wise cracking sidekick. His busiest period was the 30s when he appeared in 6 to 10 films a year including Tweedledee in ""Alice in Wonderland"" (1933), reporter Shapeley in ""It Happened One Night"" (1934), Clarence in ""Clarence"" (1937), and ""His Girl Friday"" (1940).Howard Hawks (1896-1977) directs from a Ben Hecht screenplay. Hawks directed nearly 50 films, not including the ones he resigned from or the ones he was fired from. He was nominated for an Oscar for ""Sergeant York"" (1941) and had 3 DGA nominations for his westerns (""Rio Bravo"" in 1959, ""The Big Sky"" in 1952, and ""Red River"" in 1948). He was best known for his style of overlapping dialogue, a technique commonly used in screwball comedies.The great Ben Hecht (1894-1964) had 6 academy award nominations and won 2 times (""Underworld"" and ""The  Scoundrel""). His notable films include ""Front Page"", ""Stagecoach"", ""Some Like it Hot"", and ""Gunga Din"".1934 was an OK year for films. The top box office slots went to ""Viva Villa"", ""Cleopatra"" and ""The Barretts of Wimpole Street"" and ""It Happened One Night"" was the big Oscar winner. That year ""The Thin Man"" series began, Karloff and Legosi appeared in ""The Black Cat"", Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers danced in ""The Gay Divorcee"", and Laurel and Hardy laughed it up in ""Babes in Toyland"".The NY Times praised Barrymore (""his best performance"") and said he ""acts with such imagination and zest that he never fails to keep the picture thoroughly alive."" Unfortunately 1934 was a little early for screwball comedy, and the film didn't do well at the box office.Fans of screwball comedies will enjoy this film, as will fans of Barrymore and Lombard.",3,Great theatrics from Barrymore and Lombard,1286409600,"10 7, 2010",2010,3071,"['Twentieth', 'Century', 'tour', ""d'force"", 'John', 'Barrymore', 'Carol', 'Lombard', 'film', 'based', 'successful', '1932', 'Ben', 'Hecht/Charles', 'MacArthur', 'play', 'same', 'name', 'was', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'look', 'famed', 'Broadway', 'impresario', 'David', 'Belasco', 'action', 'place', '2', 'main', 'sets', 'stage', 'board', 'train', 'Barrymore', 'Svengali', 'Lombard', 'Trilby', 'one', 'up', 'more', 'better', 'Barrymore', 'Yet', 'translated', 'big', 'screen', 'Barrymore', 'Lombard', 'theatrics', 'appear', 'larger', 'life', 'slightly', 'top', 'imagine', 'are', 'watching', 'filming', 'play', 'exaggerated', 'mannerisms', 'expressions', 'vocals', 'seem', 'more', 'natural.Barrymore', '1882-1942', 'course', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'theatric', 'performers', '20th', 'century', 'get', 'taste', 'what', 'treat', 'theatre-going', 'audiences', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'when', 'saw', 'Barrymore', 'live', 'Many', 'other', 'screen', 'performances', 'are', 'not', 'nearly', 'powerful.Carole', 'Lombard', '1908-42', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'comediennes', 'mid', '20th', 'century', 'talented', 'life', 'cut', 'short', '33', 'USO', 'tour', 'WW', '2', 'followed', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'Bolero', 'George', 'Raft', 'then', 'did', 'Man', 'Godfrey', '1936', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'time', 'was', 'Queen', 'screwball', 'comedies.Roscoe', 'Karns', '1891-1970', 'wanders', 'film', 'perpetually', 'drunk', 'state', 'Karns', 'appeared', 'more', '100', 'films', 'often', 'wise', 'cracking', 'sidekick', 'busiest', 'period', 'was', '30s', 'when', 'appeared', '6', '10', 'films', 'year', 'including', 'Tweedledee', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', '1933', 'reporter', 'Shapeley', 'Happened', 'One', 'Night', '1934', 'Clarence', 'Clarence', '1937', 'Girl', 'Friday', '1940', '.Howard', 'Hawks', '1896-1977', 'Ben', 'Hecht', 'screenplay', 'Hawks', 'directed', 'nearly', '50', 'films', 'not', 'including', 'ones', 'resigned', 'ones', 'was', 'fired', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Sergeant', 'York', '1941', 'had', '3', 'DGA', 'nominations', 'westerns', 'Rio', 'Bravo', '1959', 'Big', 'Sky', '1952', 'Red', 'River', '1948', 'was', 'best', 'known', 'style', 'overlapping', 'dialogue', 'technique', 'commonly', 'used', 'screwball', 'comedies.The', 'great', 'Ben', 'Hecht', '1894-1964', 'had', '6', 'academy', 'award', 'nominations', 'won', '2', 'times', 'Underworld', 'Scoundrel', 'notable', 'films', 'include', 'Front', 'Page', 'Stagecoach', 'Hot', 'Gunga', 'Din', '.1934', 'was', 'OK', 'year', 'films', 'top', 'box', 'office', 'slots', 'went', 'Viva', 'Villa', 'Cleopatra', 'Barretts', 'Wimpole', 'Street', 'Happened', 'One', 'Night', 'was', 'big', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'year', 'Thin', 'Man', 'series', 'began', 'Karloff', 'Legosi', 'appeared', 'Black', 'Cat', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'danced', 'Gay', 'Divorcee', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'laughed', 'up', 'Babes', 'Toyland', '.The', 'NY', 'Times', 'praised', 'Barrymore', 'best', 'performance', 'said', 'such', 'imagination', 'zest', 'never', 'keep', 'picture', 'thoroughly', 'alive', 'Unfortunately', '1934', 'was', 'little', 'early', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'box', 'office.Fans', 'screwball', 'comedies', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'will', 'fans', 'Barrymore', 'Lombard']",N/A

336891,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6302801141,Ed Uyeshima,"[5, 5]","Master filmmaker Howard Hawks' sure hand at outrageous, character-driven farce is what maneuvers this seminal 1934 screwball comedy into its acknowledged status as a film classic. More than anything else here, he appears responsible for the transformation of Carole Lombard's screen persona from uncertain glamour girl to first-class comedy pro, as she vividly portrays Mildred Plotka, a struggling actress nurtured by Oscar Jaffe, an egomaniacal Broadway impresario. Through his Svengali-like techniques, he has changed the former Mildred into Lily Garland and a major star, but his obsessive behavior leads to her departure to Hollywood for film success and his tailspin into a series of stage flops. By chance, they are both on the Twentieth Century en route from Chicago to New York, and the frenetic plot settles into Oscar's excessive attempts to re-sign Lily to another contract. Screenwriters Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, already famous for their fast-talking ""The Front Page"", apply the same kinetic energy to this broadly theatrical farce.Even though not all the comedy bits work (for instance, the rich asylum escapee's placing ""Repent"" stickers everywhere), the feverish pitch never lets up, and the cast is very game for the shenanigans. Precariously dangling himself at the edge of caricature, John Barrymore is in peak form in a ham-fisted turn as Jaffe. Whether drawing the chalk lines for Lily to follow or repeatedly caught in fake-suicide attempts, Barrymore seems to relish every moment in what was to be his last first-class starring role. On the other hand, Lombard blooms with her performance here, as she matches toe to toe with Barrymore. Their chemistry, which only hints at a romantic relationship, seems to be the prototype for all persistently contentious movie couples thereafter. Familiar character actors Roscoe Karns and Walter Connolly breezily play Jaffe's exasperated assistants. The print and audio transfers are surprisingly clean on the 2005 DVD considering the film's age.

Nearly 70 years after its premiere, TWENTIETH remains a perfect comedy and a wonderful, visually sumptuous movie. Director Howard Hawks' hand is evident, though subtly, in the many ingenious setups and camera movements. For the most part he's wisely content to let the play be the thing, blessed as he was with a brilliantly funny property and cast. You all know about Barrymore's ego-monster producer and Lombard as his diva-protege (she's scrumptious to look at throughout, and funny besides), but not enough has been written in praise of the crack support of perpetually-soused Roscoe Karns, Walter Connolly (for once playing something besides a millionaire or a city-room editor), Charles Lane and a particularly unforgettable Etienne Girardot. Of course, Barrymore outshines them all, with his 'iron-door' pronunciamentos, his acting out every role in the antebellum play he's staging, and even his deliberate (and very funny) enunciation of the name 'Max Mandelbaum'. They don't make 'em like this any more (actually, they didn't often make 'em this well back then, either). People just don't talk this fast in movies anymore, nor do comedies hurtle along at such a clip, despite all the fractured MTV-style editing techniques giving the illusion of speed &amp; motion.

The legendary John Barrymore gives a truly over the top performance but at times is edged out in that department by the frenetic Carole Lombard. Howard Hawkes' direction gives the picture a smoothness and vibrancy that makes the film seem far more polished and modern than its 1934 release date.

Just watched it a few days ago, after much anticipation, and I wanted to laugh more than I actually did.  Mogul Oscar Jaffe (John Barrymore) molds neophyte actress Mildred  Plotka (Carole Lombard) into Lily Garland; after a brief and successful  &quot;partnership&quot;, Lily bolts after Jaffe becomes too smothering for  her.  Jaffee's career in theatre spirals down; just as he fears he will  never see her again, they serendipitously end up on the same passenger  train &amp; Jaffe masterminds a way to trick her into signing a contract to  do another show with him.  Barrymore's portrayal of this tyrant is  different in a good way; rather than overact, ranting and raving, he keeps  it very dignified and in control (the &quot;get the chalk&quot; sequences  are some of the funniest in the film). Carole Lombard is good, too--she  gets to play two moods, actually, from quiet &amp; hopeless Mildred to  jaded and demanding Lily (another good moment is her fighting off Jaffe in  her compartment with her little slipper feet)--and she looks utterly  gorgeous--a couple of the gowns she wears will make men gasp.  Yet, my main  complaint is there just aren't as many genuinely funny or memorable moments  as other screwball comedies, especially if you're comparing this to the set  pieces in &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; and &quot;The Awful  Truth&quot;, or much later in the genre, &quot;The Palm Beach Story.&quot;  Also, those movies have wonderfully written secondary characters, and here  they're rather poorly drawn--you have to go by body type to distinguish  Jaffe's cronies, for example.  Direction seems more stage-like, which may  not be surprising, considering it was taken from a play, and the pacing is  just OK.  I fear I am concentrating too much on the negatives--it's a must  for fans of the leads, and those who like the screwballs; I just expected a  lot more.",3,"Worth your time, but...",946425600,"12 29, 1999",1999,1936,"['one', 'just', 'bit', 'overrated', 'opinion', 'Just', 'watched', 'few', 'days', 'ago', 'much', 'anticipation', 'wanted', 'more', 'actually', 'did', 'Mogul', 'Oscar', 'Jaffe', 'John', 'Barrymore', 'neophyte', 'actress', 'Mildred', 'Plotka', 'Carole', 'Lombard', 'Lily', 'Garland', 'brief', 'successful', 'quot', 'partnership', 'quot', 'Lily', 'bolts', 'Jaffe', 'too', 'smothering', 'Jaffee', 'career', 'theatre', 'spirals', 'down', 'just', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'serendipitously', 'end', 'up', 'same', 'passenger', 'train', 'amp', 'Jaffe', 'way', 'trick', 'signing', 'contract', 'do', 'show', 'Barrymore', 'portrayal', 'tyrant', 'different', 'good', 'way', 'rather', 'overact', 'ranting', 'raving', 'very', 'dignified', 'control', 'quot', 'get', 'chalk', 'quot', 'sequences', 'are', 'funniest', 'film', 'Carole', 'Lombard', 'good', 'too', 'play', 'two', 'moods', 'actually', 'quiet', 'amp', 'hopeless', 'Mildred', 'jaded', 'demanding', 'Lily', 'good', 'moment', 'fighting', 'off', 'Jaffe', 'compartment', 'little', 'slipper', 'feet', 'utterly', 'gorgeous', 'couple', 'gowns', 'will', 'make', 'men', 'gasp', 'main', 'complaint', 'there', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'memorable', 'moments', 'other', 'screwball', 'comedies', 'especially', ""'re"", 'comparing', 'set', 'pieces', 'quot', 'Happened', 'One', 'Night', 'quot', 'quot', 'Awful', 'Truth', 'quot', 'much', 'later', 'genre', 'quot', 'Palm', 'Beach', 'Story.', 'quot', 'Also', 'movies', 'have', 'wonderfully', 'written', 'secondary', 'characters', 'here', ""'re"", 'rather', 'poorly', 'drawn', 'have', 'go', 'body', 'type', 'distinguish', 'Jaffe', 'cronies', 'example', 'Direction', 'more', 'stage-like', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'surprising', 'considering', 'was', 'taken', 'play', 'pacing', 'just', 'OK', 'fear', 'am', 'concentrating', 'too', 'much', 'negatives', 'must', 'fans', 'leads', 'who', 'like', 'screwballs', 'just', 'expected', 'lot', 'more']",N/A

A bigger ham than any of his protiges, Oscar's career goes into a sudden tail spin after Mildred, christened Lily Garland, breaks free of his artistic stronghold for a chance to make it big in Hollywood. Now the toast of two coasts and everything in-between, Mildred doesn't need anyone to help her career. Oscar's bitter rejection and professional oblivion seems complete until he chances to meet Lily again, this time on the Twentieth Century Limited. Desperate to resign Mildred, but unwilling to admit that he needs her, the battle of the wills that ensues between these two old rivals is hilarious. The Ben Hecht/Charles MacArthur screenplay pulls out all the stops. As bitter enemies, Barrymore and Lombard are out and out crazy to the point of madcap absurdity. Howard Hawk's spirited direction in confined spaces draws upon the humanity of the piece and comes up a real winner.The same can't be said for Columbia's lack luster DVD transfer. The black and white image is very unstable. Blacks are sometimes deep, but often less than. Whites are not very clean. There is a considerable amount of film grain throughout. The contrast levels fluctuate as well. Often looking quite dirty and riddled with age related artifacts, the comedic sheen of &quot;Twentieth Century&quot; leaves something to be desired. The audio is mono but in about as good a condition as the visual elements of the film. Occasionally a pop and hiss can be heard under the arch of great performances which is a genuine shame.

Hawks and Ben Hecht collaborated nine times; it's no surprise that two of those collaborations, Scarface and His Girl Friday, are on the TSPDT list. It's also no surprise that the films that didn't make the list on which the two collaborated are some of the best-known work from either; The Thing from Another World, Barbary Coast, Monkey Business, etc. Oddly, however, Twentieth Century seems to have fallen through some sort of celluloid nook; despite Hawks, Hecht, and a top-notch cast, the movie has faded into the kind of obscurity usually reserved for Z-grade mysteries that lasted less than an hour. While this odd little attempt at a comedy-romance is wide of the mark more often than it hits the bullseye, it certainly deserves a better fate than that.Lily Garland (the great Carole Lombard, nominated for an Oscar for My Man Godfrey two years later; she lost to Luise Rainer) is, as we open, a bad actress. A very bad actress, in fact, a Minnesota farm girl who came east to try her luck on Broadway and has failed miserably. Until, that is, she tries out for a production to be directed by Walter Jaffe (John Barrymore, one of the scions of acting's greatest family). Jaffe's no-nonsense directorial style turns Garland into a star, and the two of them begin a relationship. Fast forward a few years, and that relationship has gone sour; Jaffe is as controlling offstage as on, and Garland hops the first train to Hollywood to try her hand at film. Jaffe's career goes sour, while Garland soars to new heights. When they wind up on the same train, Jaffe's advisors hatch a plot to get the two of them back together. Hilarity ensues.Hecht's screenplay is strewn with silly subplots, some of which work, some of which don't, and sillier characters, most of whom work. The oddest note here, though, is that for a comedy, especially a Depression-era comedy, this is a dark, dark movie. We're used to that nowadays; few contemporary comedies are released that don't have some sort of tearjerker factor. But back then, in the days when Chaplin and Keaton were still kings, comedy was all about, well, laughing. Here, you cringe on a fairly regular basis. While the academic part of me wants to praise Haws and Hecht to the heavens for being so forward-thinking, the emotional part of me says that there were scenes here that simply didn't feel like they fit. Not to say they weren't good, naturally. Have you ever seen a single scene in a Howard Hawks flick that wasn't directed to perfection? No, and you never will. The man was one of Hollywood's masters. But sometimes they felt as if there was another movie they should have been dropped into.Still, it's a good picture, and you'll get the requisite number of chuckles out of it. And any chance to see Carole Lombard onscreen is to be treasured, since she died far younger than she should have. Well worth checking out if you have a soft spot for Depression-era romance, and maybe even if you don't. *** ",4,"Ah, romance, old-school style.",1259539200,"11 30, 2009",2009,3261,"['Twentieth', 'Century', 'Howard', 'Hawks', '1934', 'Put', 'Oscar-nominated', 'director', 'responsible', 'eleven', 'movies', 'Shoot', 'Pictures', 'Do', ""n't"", 'list', 'thousand', 'best', 'movies', 'time', 'together', 'legendary', 'screenwriter', 'two', 'Oscar', 'wins', 'four', 'more', 'nominations', 'magic', 'bound', 'happen', 'Hawks', 'Ben', 'Hecht', 'collaborated', 'nine', 'times', 'surprise', 'two', 'collaborations', 'Scarface', 'Girl', 'Friday', 'are', 'TSPDT', 'list', 'also', 'surprise', 'films', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'list', 'two', 'collaborated', 'are', 'best-known', 'work', 'Thing', 'World', 'Barbary', 'Coast', 'Monkey', 'Business', 'etc', 'Oddly', 'however', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'have', 'fallen', 'sort', 'celluloid', 'nook', 'Hawks', 'Hecht', 'top-notch', 'cast', 'movie', 'faded', 'kind', 'obscurity', 'usually', 'reserved', 'Z-grade', 'mysteries', 'lasted', 'less', 'hour', 'odd', 'little', 'attempt', 'comedy-romance', 'wide', 'mark', 'more', 'often', 'bullseye', 'certainly', 'better', 'fate', 'that.Lily', 'Garland', 'great', 'Carole', 'Lombard', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'My', 'Man', 'Godfrey', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'lost', 'Luise', 'Rainer', 'open', 'bad', 'actress', 'very', 'bad', 'actress', 'fact', 'Minnesota', 'farm', 'girl', 'who', 'came', 'east', 'try', 'luck', 'Broadway', 'failed', 'miserably', 'out', 'production', 'be', 'directed', 'Walter', 'Jaffe', 'John', 'Barrymore', 'one', 'scions', 'acting', 'greatest', 'family', 'Jaffe', 'no-nonsense', 'directorial', 'style', 'Garland', 'star', 'two', 'begin', 'relationship', 'Fast', 'forward', 'few', 'years', 'relationship', 'gone', 'sour', 'Jaffe', 'controlling', 'offstage', 'Garland', 'first', 'train', 'Hollywood', 'try', 'hand', 'film', 'Jaffe', 'career', 'sour', 'Garland', 'soars', 'new', 'heights', 'When', 'wind', 'up', 'same', 'train', 'Jaffe', 'advisors', 'hatch', 'plot', 'get', 'two', 'back', 'together', 'Hilarity', 'ensues.Hecht', 'screenplay', 'strewn', 'silly', 'subplots', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'sillier', 'characters', 'most', 'whom', 'work', 'oddest', 'note', 'here', 'comedy', 'especially', 'Depression-era', 'comedy', 'dark', 'dark', 'movie', ""'re"", 'used', 'nowadays', 'few', 'contemporary', 'comedies', 'are', 'released', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'sort', 'tearjerker', 'factor', 'back', 'then', 'days', 'when', 'Chaplin', 'Keaton', 'were', 'still', 'kings', 'comedy', 'was', 'well', 'laughing', 'Here', 'cringe', 'fairly', 'regular', 'basis', 'academic', 'part', 'praise', 'Haws', 'Hecht', 'heavens', 'being', 'so', 'forward-thinking', 'emotional', 'part', 'were', 'scenes', 'here', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'fit', 'Not', 'say', 'were', ""n't"", 'good', 'naturally', 'Have', 'ever', 'seen', 'single', 'scene', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'flick', 'was', ""n't"", 'directed', 'perfection', 'No', 'never', 'will', 'man', 'was', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'masters', 'sometimes', 'felt', 'was', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'dropped', 'into.Still', 'good', 'picture', ""'ll"", 'get', 'requisite', 'number', 'chuckles', 'chance', 'see', 'Carole', 'Lombard', 'onscreen', 'be', 'treasured', 'died', 'far', 'younger', 'should', 'have', 'Well', 'checking', 'out', 'have', 'soft', 'spot', 'Depression-era', 'romance', 'maybe', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", '***']",N/A

In 1932 he invented the gangster film with his great classic SCARFACE.  In 1950, he created the alien Sci-fi film, when he directed (without credit, though the credited director Christian Nyby always acknowledged that Hawks actually directed) THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD.  He also made significant contributions to a host of other genres, including the detective film (THE BIG SLEEP), the adventure film (TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT), and the Western (RED RIVER).  He not only invented the Screwball comedy with TWENTIETH CENTURY in 1934, he went on to direct two of the greatest Screwball comedies ever in BRINGING UP BABY and HIS GIRL FRIDAY.  No other director in the history of film had Hawks's gifts as an originator of new types of film or his range as a director.Another problem with this film being shown so rarely is that it keeps us from seeing two of the greatest performers in American cinema, John Barrymore near the end of his star career and Carole Lombard near the beginning of hers.  This was one of the very last films Barrymore made before the years of heavy drinking began to catch up with him.  After he made this film, his remarkably handsome features began to fade, and for the last few years of his career he specialized in playing comic drunks.  This he did exceedingly well, but more because it was the only kind of role left for him to play.  But here, in this film, we get the real John Barrymore for one last, great role.  Lombard had made a gigantic number of films in the twenties and the early thirties, but it was only with this film that she became an ""A List"" actress.  From this point on, she would be regarded as one of if not the greatest screen comedienne, and would be in some of the finest comedies ever made until her premature death in 1942.The plot is simple:  Broadway impresario Oscar Jaffe's (Barrymore) career had been on a long slide since his greatest discovery, Lily Garland, has departed the stage for stardom in Hollywood.  They accidentally meet on the Twentieth Century Limited, and he decides play every trick in the book to get her back into his life, both professionally and otherwise.  The script is exceedingly witty, and was a reworking of a stage play written by Ben Hecht and Charles Macarthur, whose work Hawks would film again in 1940 in HIS GIRL FRIDAY.  The tight, terse, fast-moving dialogue that we associate with Hecht and Macarthur are evident at every point in TWENTIETH CENTURY.  Between Hawks's deft direction, Barrymore and Lombard's performances (as well as the work of several crack character actors such as Walter Connolly), and such a superb script, this film was can't-miss from the start.A bit of trivia:  Howard Hawks and Carole Lombard were second cousins.",5,The greatest classic comedy no one has seen,1052956800,"05 15, 2003",2003,3197,"['great', 'screen', 'comedies', 'Golden', 'Age', 'Hollywood', 'Studio', 'system', 'few', 'are', 'seen', 'as', 'rarely', 'TWENTIETH', 'CENTURY', 'tragic', 'number', 'reasons', 'First', 'film', 'usually', 'considered', 'first', 'Screwball', 'comedies', 'glorified', 'thirties', 'forties', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'unusual', 'unique', 'distinction', 'great', 'directors', 'not', 'only', 'having', 'mastered', 'huge', 'number', 'genres', 'having', 'actually', 'invented', 'several', '1932', 'invented', 'gangster', 'film', 'great', 'classic', 'SCARFACE', '1950', 'created', 'alien', 'Sci-fi', 'film', 'when', 'directed', 'credit', 'credited', 'director', 'Christian', 'Nyby', 'always', 'acknowledged', 'Hawks', 'actually', 'directed', 'THE', 'THING', 'FROM', 'ANOTHER', 'WORLD', 'also', 'made', 'significant', 'contributions', 'host', 'other', 'genres', 'including', 'detective', 'film', 'THE', 'BIG', 'SLEEP', 'adventure', 'film', 'TO', 'HAVE', 'AND', 'HAVE', 'NOT', 'Western', 'RED', 'RIVER', 'not', 'only', 'invented', 'Screwball', 'comedy', 'TWENTIETH', 'CENTURY', '1934', 'went', 'direct', 'two', 'greatest', 'Screwball', 'comedies', 'ever', 'BRINGING', 'UP', 'BABY', 'HIS', 'GIRL', 'FRIDAY', 'other', 'director', 'history', 'film', 'had', 'Hawks', 'gifts', 'originator', 'new', 'types', 'film', 'range', 'director.Another', 'problem', 'film', 'being', 'shown', 'so', 'rarely', 'seeing', 'two', 'greatest', 'performers', 'American', 'cinema', 'John', 'Barrymore', 'end', 'star', 'career', 'Carole', 'Lombard', 'beginning', 'hers', 'was', 'one', 'very', 'last', 'films', 'Barrymore', 'made', 'years', 'heavy', 'drinking', 'began', 'catch', 'up', 'made', 'film', 'remarkably', 'handsome', 'features', 'began', 'fade', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'career', 'specialized', 'playing', 'comic', 'drunks', 'did', 'exceedingly', 'well', 'more', 'was', 'only', 'kind', 'role', 'left', 'play', 'here', 'film', 'get', 'real', 'John', 'Barrymore', 'one', 'last', 'great', 'role', 'Lombard', 'had', 'made', 'gigantic', 'number', 'films', 'twenties', 'early', 'thirties', 'was', 'only', 'film', 'became', 'List', 'actress', 'point', 'would', 'be', 'regarded', 'one', 'not', 'greatest', 'screen', 'comedienne', 'would', 'be', 'finest', 'comedies', 'ever', 'made', 'premature', 'death', '1942.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'Broadway', 'impresario', 'Oscar', 'Jaffe', 'Barrymore', 'career', 'had', 'been', 'long', 'slide', 'greatest', 'discovery', 'Lily', 'Garland', 'departed', 'stage', 'stardom', 'Hollywood', 'accidentally', 'meet', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'Limited', 'trick', 'book', 'get', 'back', 'life', 'professionally', 'otherwise', 'script', 'exceedingly', 'witty', 'was', 'reworking', 'stage', 'play', 'written', 'Ben', 'Hecht', 'Charles', 'Macarthur', 'work', 'Hawks', 'would', 'film', 'again', '1940', 'HIS', 'GIRL', 'FRIDAY', 'tight', 'terse', 'fast-moving', 'dialogue', 'associate', 'Hecht', 'Macarthur', 'are', 'evident', 'point', 'TWENTIETH', 'CENTURY', 'Between', 'Hawks', 'deft', 'direction', 'Barrymore', 'Lombard', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'work', 'several', 'crack', 'character', 'actors', 'such', 'Walter', 'Connolly', 'superb', 'script', 'film', 'was', ""can't-miss"", 'start.A', 'bit', 'trivia', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'Carole', 'Lombard', 'were', 'second', 'cousins']",N/A

It stars Carole Lombard and John Barrymore as a sort of Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne couple. These Hollywood glitterati and literati collaborated to make this sparkling champagne freshet of a movie that should be brought back into wide circulation. Much of it comes across as crisp, modern, and even technologically ahead of its time - as when Barrymore orders a phone tap in an attempt to catch his wife in what he believes are her frequent infidelities.There might not be many belly laughs here, although I did literally LOL at least once. Barrymore boards the Twentieth Century train in heavy disguise in an attempt to evade his creditors. Once sequestered aboard in his compartment, he laments his dismal situation, meanwhile tugging at the putty on his nose. He pulls the putty into a longer and longer taffy extension, until he's unwittingly achieved a veritable Pinocchio proboscis. Finally, when neither nose nor man is able to sustain any further prolongation of their misery - they droop in unison. It's a hilarious scene.Barrymore is in top form here. He generally disdained movies, believing they were beneath him. He regarded the legitimate theater as the only medium for the true actor. As a result, he usually chewed up the scenery in his movie rolls, leaving his characters mercilessly shredded. Here though, he strikes just the right note of hamminess. He stops short of being over-the-top in any scene, but retains the kind of antic energy that this sort of madcap comedy calls for.Barrymore is also at his most handsome in this film. The viewer can readily see how he got the cognomen ""The Great Profile."" It's a pleasure to go back to a time when there were, not ""media figures,"" but ""matinee idols."" The latter rarified creatures radiated unattainably from the silver screen - beyond the trivializations of paparazzi or talk shows. This movie allows that sort of transport.""Twentieth Century"" allows another kind of transport though. It might be of special interest to train buffs. Since the real Twentieth Century train made its last run a few years ago, it left many train club members especially eager to collect memorabilia from those old glory days of cross-country luxury travel. It's unlikely that any of the interior train shots in this movie are authentic. Those are probably all just studio lot sets. However there are a few shots of what I took to be the actual Twentieth Century train pulling into New York's Grand Central Station in the early 1930's. Train enthusiasts might like to check out ""Twentieth Century"" for these shots alone.Anyone else who would just like to roll along with some breezy, fast-paced dialogue in the company of Hollywood legends - will also want to get on-board.",5,A Sparkling Collaboration of 1930's Luminaries,1248307200,"07 23, 2009",2009,2812,"['Charles', 'MacArthur', 'Ben', 'Hecht', 'wrote', 'script', 'movie', 'Howard', 'Hawkes', 'directed', 'Carole', 'Lombard', 'John', 'Barrymore', 'sort', 'Alfred', 'Lunt', 'Lynn', 'Fontanne', 'couple', 'Hollywood', 'glitterati', 'literati', 'collaborated', 'make', 'sparkling', 'champagne', 'freshet', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'brought', 'back', 'wide', 'circulation', 'Much', 'crisp', 'modern', 'even', 'technologically', 'ahead', 'time', 'when', 'Barrymore', 'orders', 'phone', 'tap', 'attempt', 'catch', 'wife', 'what', 'are', 'frequent', 'infidelities.There', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'many', 'belly', 'here', 'did', 'literally', 'LOL', 'least', 'once', 'Barrymore', 'boards', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'train', 'heavy', 'disguise', 'attempt', 'evade', 'creditors', 'Once', 'sequestered', 'aboard', 'compartment', 'dismal', 'situation', 'meanwhile', 'tugging', 'putty', 'nose', 'putty', 'longer', 'longer', 'taffy', 'extension', 'unwittingly', 'achieved', 'veritable', 'Pinocchio', 'proboscis', 'Finally', 'when', 'nose', 'man', 'able', 'sustain', 'further', 'prolongation', 'misery', 'droop', 'unison', 'hilarious', 'scene.Barrymore', 'top', 'form', 'here', 'generally', 'disdained', 'movies', 'believing', 'were', 'beneath', 'regarded', 'legitimate', 'theater', 'only', 'medium', 'true', 'actor', 'result', 'usually', 'chewed', 'up', 'scenery', 'movie', 'rolls', 'leaving', 'characters', 'mercilessly', 'shredded', 'Here', 'just', 'right', 'note', 'hamminess', 'short', 'being', 'over-the-top', 'scene', 'kind', 'antic', 'energy', 'sort', 'madcap', 'comedy', 'for.Barrymore', 'also', 'most', 'handsome', 'film', 'viewer', 'can', 'readily', 'see', 'how', 'got', 'cognomen', 'Great', 'Profile', 'pleasure', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'when', 'were', 'not', 'media', 'figures', 'matinee', 'idols', 'latter', 'rarified', 'creatures', 'radiated', 'unattainably', 'silver', 'screen', 'trivializations', 'paparazzi', 'talk', 'shows', 'movie', 'sort', 'transport', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'kind', 'transport', 'might', 'be', 'special', 'interest', 'train', 'buffs', 'real', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'train', 'made', 'last', 'run', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'left', 'many', 'train', 'club', 'members', 'especially', 'eager', 'collect', 'memorabilia', 'old', 'glory', 'days', 'cross-country', 'luxury', 'travel', 'unlikely', 'interior', 'train', 'shots', 'movie', 'are', 'authentic', 'are', 'probably', 'just', 'studio', 'lot', 'sets', 'However', 'are', 'few', 'shots', 'what', 'took', 'be', 'actual', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'train', 'pulling', 'New', 'York', 'Grand', 'Central', 'Station', 'early', '1930', 'Train', 'enthusiasts', 'might', 'like', 'check', 'out', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'shots', 'alone.Anyone', 'else', 'who', 'would', 'just', 'like', 'roll', 'along', 'breezy', 'fast-paced', 'dialogue', 'company', 'Hollywood', 'will', 'also', 'want', 'get', 'on-board']",N/A

Smith-Peter,"[0, 4]","From the reviews here and elsewhere I had high hopes of this film, which follows the clash between theater impresario Oscar Jaffe (John Barrymore) and aspiring, then successful, actress Lily Garland (Carole Lombard).  The acting is excellent, and both actors are at the top of the game.  And yet I felt that this was not a satisfying romantic comedy.  The reason why is that Barrymore's character never seems to really change.  In _It Happened One Night_, the ur-romantic comedy, both male and female leads have to change to be worthy of each other.  And yet, here, Lombard is the one who has to grow up, while Barrymore gets to remain an emotional child.There are a lot of great scenes and dialogue, but in the end I didn't feel completely convinced that the leads should be together.  This is, in many ways, one of those films that is aimed at putting a woman in her place, like _My Fair Lady_.

However, it's good enough to view the film and enjoy it.  Director Howard Hawks has done a marvelous job of mixing the elements and producing a witty and sometimes hectic comedy.  John Barrymore is strictly over the top here, somewhat like Jack Nicholson in the first Batman.  This film benefits greatly from being a ""pre-code.""  If the production had occured later, this film would be a waste.  As it is, the adult humor shines through and helps carry the film.  This also permits Miss Lombard the luxury of wearing some provocative gowns which keeps the male interest going.The film starts slowly, introducing and building a plot line (there's a plot to screwball comedies?) until we finally get to the train, the Twentieth Century.  After that, the nut jobs started coming out of the woodwork and I began laughing till the end of the film.  This is a great pre-code screwball comedy.
