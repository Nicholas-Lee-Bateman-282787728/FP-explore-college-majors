742700,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00008HCA9,Alfred Johnson,"[2, 2]","The dreams of the very wretched of the earth are different from you and I. Or are they? This is the true subject matter of Eugene O'Neill fine play. Very little action, lots of drinking, lots of dreaming, lots philosophizing and in a low down gin mill to boot doesn't sound like the makings of a great American play. But, it is. This thing turns into a microcosm of American society in the early part of the 20th century. Between shots of whiskey and beer the denizens of this small work exhibit all the emotions, contradictions, fear of failure, fear of success, fear of life that the rest of us `normals' have to face. Except, for dramatic effect, those flophouse devotees get their noses rubbed in it by one Harry Hickey- traveling salesman, former chief denizen who now has got `religion' and wants to spread his newfound  `glad tidings'. Spare us from the Hickeys of the world-a little dreaminess and a couple of illusions never hurt anyone. Did they? Although in O'Neill's hands the dialogue is a little stilted and the characters are a little stereotyped and wooden the point he is trying to make gets across just fine.

742701,A2F3SXHT6RBV81,B00008HCA9,"Betty Burks ""Betty  Burks""","[4, 15]","Written by Eugene O'Neill, winner of the Nobel prize for Literature, this movie is based on radicals in Greenwich Village where he lived for a time.  In 1911, he lived on the waterfront of Manhattan's skid row on Fulton Street, and used some of the residents as the characters in this play.  By 1920, he was a published author along the lines of Tennessee Williams and James Agee and winner of the Pulitzer Prize for 'Beyond the Horizon.'This movie lacks action per se but has plenty of character study; in this one, Mark liked Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, my favorite poet (""and the hight shall be filled with music"").  In the rogue's gallery, he even sang a song about Jack, an Irish tome.  It may be quiet and simple, but it is far from perfect: all about alcoholics (not my favorite subject).  Three doxies in the bar welcome Hickey back to find a 'music man' talker who won't drink booze any more.It is like a filmed play, no action outside the pub.  One black man in the group smashed his glass and had a chip on his shoulder.  The Britisher leaves in a huff as they are showing him no respect for a high education.  Hickey's return has upset the status quo as the drinkers resent his saintemonious better-than-thou actions.  The Irishman resented his ""airs."" and even the has-been lawyer defends his pipe dreams.  Each has his own foibles and fears.The Ice man is death and no one welcomes death with open arms.  Death is to be dreaded and avoided by all means.  Death is final and can't be regretted.  Death is forever for sinners like these.

The subtleness and reality of the characters in this master piece of filmaking is truly amazing. The movie is an accurate study of what life inside of a drab, bowery bar (circa 1912) was like but it's the characters that are so authentic that the people who made this knew exactly what their subjects were all about. You could almost taste the dirty ashtrays and stale beer reeking out of this hole-in-the-wall. While Lee Marvin gets the headlines, and deservedly so in most films he's in, and Robert Ryan too, it's Fredric March who steals the show as the bar owner who hasn't left his dwelling in 20 years.

Chances are this 2003 release from Kino won't get an upgrade unless they decide to put it on Blu-Ray along with the other American Film Theatre titles which, like the original series, have no commercial potential. That's really too bad for just like Shakespeare or any serious drama, subtitles are needed to help people not only get the dialogue but the subtext of that dialogue. This is especially true of O'Neill who uses lots of words to express what his characters are feeling and thinking. THE ICEMAN COMETH is loaded with dialogue that not only works as a character portrait but as a vehicle for the ideas these characters (and O'Neill) want us to think about. No other O'Neill play, not even LONG DAY'S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT, has such heavy discussions.This 1973 film version has become legendary for being uncut, for its performances, and for being impossible to see since the original release. Now that it's been preserved (even without subtitles), it's something to be treasured. Much has been written about the performances of Frederic March, Robert Ryan, and especially Lee Marvin (who may not be Jason Robards but he makes an ideal Hickey) but it's the supporting players who make this version really special. In addition to the young Jeff Bridges there's Moses Gunn whose ""I'm a gamblin man"" speech still has the power to take your breath away. Bradford Dillman has never been better as the pathetic son of rich parents who has become a helpless alcoholic. There's Martyn Green, 34 years after his Koko in the 1939 MIKADO and last but not least Tom Pedi, the original bartender from 1946.Director John Frankenheimer, who began his career directing plays for television in the 1950s, still knows how to film a stage play retaining it's theatricality while making it cinematic. The crisp editing combined with the inexorable close-ups allow us to see the characters' reactions as well as provide a look into the characters' souls. What seems slow and deliberate at first (which it is) becomes a powerful viewing experience by the end. It's even better on subsequent viewings and it should be seen more than once in order to grasp the subtleties and complexities of the characterizations and to appreciate O'Neill's poetic dialogue. Thanks to Kino (now Kino Lorber) for ressurecting this classic but now it's time to upgrade to subtitles so that we can get so much more out of what O'Neill has bequeathed to us.",5,Superb Adaptation Could Use Some Subtitles...,1343606400,"07 30, 2012",2012,2472,"['highly', 'unlikely', 'point', 'time', 'Chances', 'are', '2003', 'release', 'Kino', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'upgrade', 'decide', 'put', 'Blu-Ray', 'other', 'American', 'Film', 'Theatre', 'titles', 'original', 'series', 'have', 'commercial', 'potential', 'really', 'too', 'bad', 'just', 'like', 'Shakespeare', 'serious', 'drama', 'subtitles', 'are', 'needed', 'help', 'people', 'not', 'only', 'get', 'dialogue', 'subtext', 'dialogue', 'especially', 'true', ""O'Neill"", 'who', 'lots', 'words', 'express', 'what', 'characters', 'are', 'feeling', 'thinking', 'ICEMAN', 'COMETH', 'loaded', 'dialogue', 'not', 'only', 'character', 'portrait', 'vehicle', 'ideas', 'characters', ""O'Neill"", 'want', 'think', 'other', ""O'Neill"", 'play', 'not', 'even', 'LONG', 'DAY', 'JOURNEY', 'INTO', 'NIGHT', 'such', 'heavy', 'discussions.This', '1973', 'film', 'version', 'become', 'legendary', 'being', 'uncut', 'performances', 'being', 'impossible', 'see', 'original', 'release', 'Now', 'been', 'preserved', 'even', 'subtitles', 'something', 'be', 'treasured', 'Much', 'been', 'written', 'performances', 'Frederic', 'March', 'Robert', 'Ryan', 'especially', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'ideal', 'Hickey', 'supporting', 'players', 'who', 'make', 'version', 'really', 'special', 'addition', 'young', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Moses', 'Gunn', ""'m"", 'gamblin', 'man', 'speech', 'still', 'power', 'take', 'breath', 'away', 'Bradford', 'Dillman', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'pathetic', 'son', 'rich', 'parents', 'who', 'become', 'helpless', 'alcoholic', 'Martyn', 'Green', '34', 'years', 'Koko', '1939', 'MIKADO', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'Tom', 'Pedi', 'original', 'bartender', '1946.Director', 'John', 'Frankenheimer', 'who', 'began', 'career', 'directing', 'plays', 'television', '1950s', 'still', 'how', 'film', 'stage', 'play', 'retaining', 'theatricality', 'making', 'cinematic', 'crisp', 'editing', 'combined', 'inexorable', 'close-ups', 'allow', 'see', 'characters', 'reactions', 'as', 'well', 'provide', 'look', 'characters', 'souls', 'What', 'slow', 'deliberate', 'first', 'powerful', 'viewing', 'experience', 'end', 'even', 'better', 'subsequent', 'viewings', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'more', 'once', 'order', 'grasp', 'subtleties', 'complexities', 'characterizations', 'appreciate', ""O'Neill"", 'poetic', 'dialogue', 'Thanks', 'Kino', 'now', 'Kino', 'Lorber', 'ressurecting', 'classic', 'now', 'time', 'upgrade', 'subtitles', 'so', 'can', 'get', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'what', ""O'Neill"", 'bequeathed']",N/A
742704,A2OOXUXSS03V3X,B00008HCA9,David M. Goldberg,"[2, 2]","Personally, I regard this as O'Neill's greatest play, and a towering achievement of the world of drama since tha death of Shakespeare (whoever he was!). It also impressed me as the finest of the many achievemens of Eli Landau and the American Film Theatre. The reasons are many, but they include: the stellar cast in which there is not a weak link and to which the adjectives ""brilliant"" and ""awesome"" could be liberally applied without miscarriage of justice; the special thrill of seeing actors like Robert Ryan and Lee Marvin taking on parts in which one would expect them to be miscast and yet triumph gloriously; and the acerbic but golden-hearted patron of the wretched drinking hole, Frederic March as Harry Hope, keeping the entire company of slobs in some kind of dissonant harmony through the healing properties of cheap booze, and in doing so turning in one of the top ten performances of World Theatre. No less impressive is the superb direction of John Frankenheimer; like its denizens, he never allows the camera to stray outside Harry's Bar. This intense focus on the characters risks claustrophobia but skillfully manages to avoid it, thus creating the true impression of a theatre performance rather than a film.With these resources, the themes of illusion and reality, self-delusion and self-knowledge, man's need for self espect when it is least deserving, are explored and analyzed with profound insight. In this Hell of darkness, the interplay of the characters choreographed by the quixotic Hickey strikes sparks of light that reveal more of the human condition than in a dozen lesser plays. O'Neills darkly eloquent dialogue contains many examples of poetry and wit as well as some mawkish passages that one can forgive in a work of this length. He allows the characters to be stripped of their illusions and finally, in a dramatic reversal, to joyfully cover their spiritual nakedness in the same tattered rags and carry on business as usual. In doing so, he reveals a level of craftsmanship and a knoweldge of human nature well beyond that found in most of his other plays, good though they are. He easily outclasses his achievement in ""Long Day's Journey"" which after all is a play about a single family. This play is about all mankind.Thanks are due to those who put this disc together for the fascinating account of the all too short history of the American Film Theatre that comprises part of the bonus material.",5,Darkness and Light in Harry's Bar,1275350400,"06 1, 2010",2010,2441,"['Personally', 'regard', ""O'Neill"", 'greatest', 'play', 'towering', 'achievement', 'world', 'drama', 'tha', 'death', 'Shakespeare', 'was', 'also', 'impressed', 'finest', 'many', 'achievemens', 'Eli', 'Landau', 'American', 'Film', 'Theatre', 'reasons', 'are', 'many', 'include', 'stellar', 'cast', 'not', 'weak', 'link', 'adjectives', 'brilliant', 'awesome', 'could', 'be', 'liberally', 'applied', 'miscarriage', 'justice', 'special', 'thrill', 'seeing', 'actors', 'Robert', 'Ryan', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'taking', 'parts', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'be', 'miscast', 'yet', 'triumph', 'gloriously', 'acerbic', 'golden-hearted', 'patron', 'wretched', 'drinking', 'hole', 'Frederic', 'March', 'Harry', 'Hope', 'keeping', 'entire', 'company', 'slobs', 'kind', 'dissonant', 'harmony', 'healing', 'properties', 'cheap', 'booze', 'doing', 'so', 'turning', 'one', 'top', 'ten', 'performances', 'World', 'Theatre', 'No', 'less', 'impressive', 'superb', 'direction', 'John', 'Frankenheimer', 'denizens', 'never', 'camera', 'stray', 'outside', 'Harry', 'Bar', 'intense', 'focus', 'characters', 'risks', 'claustrophobia', 'skillfully', 'avoid', 'thus', 'creating', 'true', 'impression', 'theatre', 'performance', 'rather', 'film.With', 'resources', 'themes', 'illusion', 'reality', 'self-delusion', 'self-knowledge', 'man', 'need', 'self', 'espect', 'when', 'least', 'deserving', 'are', 'explored', 'analyzed', 'profound', 'insight', 'Hell', 'darkness', 'interplay', 'characters', 'choreographed', 'quixotic', 'Hickey', 'strikes', 'sparks', 'light', 'more', 'human', 'condition', 'dozen', 'lesser', 'plays', ""O'Neills"", 'darkly', 'eloquent', 'dialogue', 'many', 'examples', 'poetry', 'wit', 'as', 'well', 'mawkish', 'passages', 'one', 'can', 'forgive', 'work', 'length', 'characters', 'be', 'stripped', 'illusions', 'finally', 'dramatic', 'reversal', 'joyfully', 'cover', 'spiritual', 'nakedness', 'same', 'tattered', 'rags', 'carry', 'business', 'usual', 'doing', 'so', 'level', 'craftsmanship', 'knoweldge', 'human', 'nature', 'well', 'found', 'most', 'other', 'plays', 'good', 'are', 'easily', 'achievement', 'Long', 'Day', 'Journey', 'play', 'single', 'family', 'play', 'mankind.Thanks', 'are', 'due', 'who', 'put', 'disc', 'together', 'fascinating', 'account', 'too', 'short', 'history', 'American', 'Film', 'Theatre', 'part', 'bonus', 'material']",N/A

The scene is Harry Hope's skid row bar.  The action takes place in four acts over two days.  Act One is the early morning of Harry Hope's birthday.  Act Two is the birthday party that evening.  Act Three is the following morning.  Act Four takes place in the very early hours of the next day.  The total play runs for four hours on two discs, two acts to each disc.The story is well known.  A bunch of life's failures inhabit the bar.  They have rooms upstairs, and rarely go out.  Some get remittances from families who want them to stay away from home.  Others get funds from whatever means.  One is a pimp who is supported by a woman.  The men are joined by three tarts who use the bar as their home base.  The men are awaiting the arrival of Teddy ""Hickey"" Hickman, a successful salesman who always shows up for Harry Hope's birthday, buys them drinks and kids around.  They all have their pipe dreams about how they are going to redeem themselves, but they will do it tomorrow, just as they will pay Harry their room rent tomorrow.Robert Ryan gave an outstanding performance as Larry, the philosophical ex-anarchist who sometimes can say more with a look than with words.  Lee Marvin plays Hickey, the type role where he excelled.  The young Jeff Bridges played Parritt, a young friend of Larry who shows up with problems he wants to confess, and is having trouble coming to grips with himself.  Fredric March plays Harry Hope, the bar owner just turning 60 who has not left the bar since his wife died 20 years earlier.  Tom Pedi is Rocky, the bartender who takes money from two women on the side, but won't admit to being a pimp.  The entire supporting cast gave great performances.Hickey shows up claiming to be reformed, and trys to make the other characters give up their pipe dreams.  They all start out the door, but come back again.  The time is just not quite right, but they say they will venture out later - maybe tomorrow.  In the end, Hickey's own secrets are revealed, and the others convince themselves that Hickey is crazy and that they are OK.There is a side plot involving Larry, and his young friend Parritt who is grappling with his problems.  In the end, Parritt seems to be the only one influenced by Hickey as he resolves his inner turmoil.The Iceman, by the way, is what is waiting outside the door (in some cases death).  The name comes from one of Hickey's jokes about how the iceman comes around to see his wife when he is out of town (this is 1912 when people had ice boxes and took deliveries of ice).My only complaint is that the full cast is not listed on the DVD case.

It's uttered by Larry, brilliantly played by Robert Ryan (one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood history).  It sums up this Dostoyevsky like play/film.  It's very heavy going, rarely showing a ray of sunshine in the dismal existences of the sad souls that populate Harry's Hope, a 1912 dive bar where getting another round of whiskey is all that matters in these shattered lives.  Some hang onto their pipe dreams, but they are only dreams.  This is a full text, uncut version of the film, directed by the great John Frankenheimer (The original Manchurian Candidate and Seconds).  The film had rarely been seen (in any form) since its premiere with the American Film Theater endeavor undertaken by Ely Landau.  Kino has restored this film to its original 239 minute length.  Kudos to them for bringing it to us.  While there are problems with the source material (you can tell where material's been restored and the sound isn't always clear), it's still worth watching.

I was surprised to find Fredric March in this. A movie star from the early days of the sound era, a two tme Oscar winner, I always knew March was a good and well respected actor, and there were two times when he shocked me and I realised HOW good he was: one was the original A STAR IS BORN where his performance surpassed the era it came from, playing more modern amidst the hokum and phony sentimentality that surrounded everything else in the picture, giving the film a lasting relevancy; the other was INHERIT THE WIND, where I was all geared up to watch Spencer Tracy in a great role and wound up picking my jaw off the floor at March in the Brady role. No Academy nomination, no lasting hossanahs, was anybody else aware of what March was doing here? Well his performance here surpasses those two. Amazing how his acting style kept changing, permitting him to give relevant performances for over forty years in quality films. His work here is fully shaded and from an aesthetic viewpoint, a joy to watch. But even his performance is not the outstanding one in the picture. That honor goes to Robert Ryan. ROBERT RYAN??!!??!! Always a solid performer, whether playing the hard-bitten good guy or the hard-bitten bad guy (usually), there is nothing in his canon of work that will prepare you for the magnitude or the depth of his performance here. Who knew there was a giant, and I do mean GIANT, talent lurking in that lean boxer frame. It will make you angry, and sad, that his talent was barely scratched in all those movies. But it is ultimately a blessing that in this, his last film, he was able to get a role that would utilize his full range as an actor. An incredible revelation. Since these AFT productions only played for 2 screenings, they fell under the radar of the Academy Awards' stipulation that a film must play for a week to be eligible for nominations, which is why you won't see any of these AFT productions in the Academy books on excellence. Marvin doesn't hit the mark of these two performances, but he is very good, at times excellent.

742712,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B00008HCA9,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[35, 38]","Consider the fact that not one but two of the actors in this astoundingly good production gave their last cinematic performances.  Now consider that one of them gave one of his first performances.  The convergence of talent for this full 4 hour production is beyond prodigious; it's breathtaking.  Robert Ryan and Frederic March are flawless as two old, embittered men whose reliance on booze, day to day, gets them through life.  Both have women who abandoned them--one died, one left.  Both lapse into stark cynicism that breaks the heart.  Both, when you see their faces, make you want to cry from the pain they feel.They are the best here, but the supporting cast is almost as good. Jeff Bridges, in one of his first roles, gives it everything he's got to convey the portrait of a young man who's trying as hard as he can to steer clear of the bitterness and cynicism that surrounds him in Harry Hope's (Frederic March) skid row saloon, frequented by Harry, Larry (Robert Ryan), and an assortment of others whose lives have left them nothing but the will to drink and drink some more.Parritt, Jeff Bridges' character, almost succeeds in shucking off the hopelessness, but if he fully succeeded, he wouldn't keep returning to the place--which he does.  He's the odd one out; the others are grizzled or, if young (like Brad Dillman's character, Willie) so besotted they're decades older than their natural years.  Into this morass of self-pity and useless nostalgia comes Hickey--Lee Marvin--a salesman who exhorts everyone to give up their pipe dreams, get off the sauce like he's recently done, and face reality.Easier said than done.  You'd think that four hours of a play would become wearying, but the actors are so good here, and the dialogue so strong--thanks to master craftsman Eugene O'Neill--that rather than putting you to sleep, this drama has the opposite effect.  Mention should also be made of Moses Gunn as the sole black man in the place who's embittered as well, blaming the white man for his failure when it's all too clear it's his own shortcomings that have led him to Harry's dive.  Gunn is terrific in his role, almost as good as Ryan and March.This is American drama at its finest, and a production, part of the American Film Theater (AFT) series, that does justice to O'Neill's gripping play.  It's impossible to fault anyone here, and the director, John Frankenheimer--better known for great thrillers like The Train and Seconds--said that this was the best work he ever did.  The DVD comes with a number of extras including an interview with Edy Landau, co-producer of the entire American Film Theater series; a brief introduction by her now-deceased husband (taped in 1974), Eli Landau, the other co-producer; a gallery of stills; a set of trailers for many of the AFT films; reviews of the series by various critics; and an essay on The Iceman Cometh by Michael Feingold, premier New York film critic.This is a superior piece of dramatic work that should not be missed, and one of the great American plays.

It was directed by John Frankenheimer.The stellar cast included Fredric March, Lee Marvin, Robert Ryan, Jeff Bridges, Moses Gunn and Bradford Dillman.Set in 1913, the  four-hour play centers around the down-and-out men and women who populate the New York skid row bar, owned by Harry Hope (March, in his final film role).  They are awaiting the annual arrival of Hickey (Marvin), a salesman who jokes about his ""cheating"" wife, buys everybody drinks and perpetuates their false hopes and dreams.This year, something is different.  Hickey is not only ""on the wagon,"" but he's going to put each and every one of the barflies' dreams under a microscope and smash them.Robert Ryan, playing the philosophical Larry, steals the acting honors in this fine production, with March taking a close second as the saloon keeper who has not stepped outside the establishment for twenty years.Marvin makes an okay Hickey, but we'd much rather have seen Jason Robards repeat his legendary performance that he did both off-Broadway and on television's ""Play of the Week"".Nevertheless, this is a fine production that will be enjoyed by everyone who loves great theatre.

742716,A22FFXBR4U3S8X,B00008HCA9,Michael B. Green,"[8, 9]","The Iceman Cometh is a contender for being, and it is my personal pick for, the Great American Play.  Its freighted central premise is that mankind cannot live without deep personal illusions - pipe dreams - that each of the characters can recognize in others but not in himself.  Facing the truth leads not to liberation, but to spiritual death and despair - complete emotional paralysis and collapse. All the action takes place in 1912 in Harry Hope's saloon smack dab in the middle of Tammany Hall corruption of which the aging Hope was long ago a peripheral player.  The characters - ex-cops and socialists, former newsmen and military men, bartenders, pimps and hookers - are all portrayed with both a gritty realism yet tenderness that reflects O'Neill's refusal to pass judgment on human frailty.  Into this atmospheric haze of drunken self-deception strides like a behemoth one Theodore Hickey, a good-time merchandise drummer liked and loved by them all, but now a self-declared convert to the truth who proclaims that he has cast aside all his pipe dreams, liberated himself, and with missionary zeal is determined to share his good fortune with all the others by bringing them the same peace he claims to have found.  It should not betray too much to say that Hickey, the play's core, has only inveigled himself deeper into self-deception.  The play's only structural weakness is that O'Neill clearly wants to say something about all humanity, but in being forced to write what he knew best, wrote only of barflies, alcoholics and patent losers so that it is far too easy to dismiss his message as being about them, but not ourselves, the literate readers or audience of Iceman.The theatrical production runs five hours and it is all but impossible to find a live production of it even in major metropolitan centers, so aside from the enormous pleasure of reading the text and imagining the play as it was intended - which I strongly recommend in any case - there are only the 1960 Broadway Theater Archive (BTA) and the 1973 American Film Theater (AFT) productions available.  If you were forced to choose, then the BTA production with Jason Robards as Hickey is the one to watch, despite its being pared down to little more than three hours so that some of the understanding of and affection for the minor characters is lost.  Robards and director Sidney Lumet grasp that at his core Hickey is a charmer and a salesman, holding himself to be no better than others and happy to wallow and cavort in the mud with them with the blessed relief of not having to pretend to be better than he is.  Hickey sees everyone else's pipe dreams and plays to them so surely and instinctively as a fish swims in water that he is loved by all who await his arrival for Harry Hope's 60th birthday celebration.  The havoc Hickey wreaks in stripping illusions from his brethren occurs despite himself, causes him pain and distress, and is tinctured with the true believer's conviction that all the pain is only in transition.  Hickey's own vulnerability while proselytizing is essential to the performance: unless he can convert the others to the peace he claims to enjoy his own alleged peace stands in doubt.  This dynamic creates an almost perfect opportunity for the subtlest and deepest interactions among the performers whose words, gestures, facial expressions and hesitations must reflect the multiple layers of the drama enacted and unfolding.  Robards does this magnificently and would be a tough act to follow in any case.Unhappily, the central defect with the AFT production was not Lee Marvin's failure to measure up to Robard's Hickey, but an utter failure on Marvin's part to understand his character and the unfortunate and harder to understand failure of director John Frankenheimer to set his actor on the character's proper course.  There are long, unnerving, and quite puzzling interludes with Hickey present during which the assembly of fine actors seems simply to be waiting for others to finish in order to say their lines.  The reason that they are unable to do better is that they are acting their parts in the Iceman while Marvin is not, and probably cannot.  Perhaps Frankenheimer tried to do more with Marvin but reconciled himself to not having a silk purse.  I suspect that Marvin was given this role to show the range and depth of his talent and this range and depth turned out to be considerably less than any could have imagined.Instead of playing Hickey as a charmer and missionary salesman, Marvin plays him like a tough-guy cop trying to beat a confession out of his victims: by god they are going to face the truth and like it even if it hurts.  Instead of the promise of liberation and peace that Robard's Hickey offers, Marvin's pushes their faces into it as though he were potty training a puppy by forcing each of them to see exactly the mess you made here!  With Marvin the words of empathy for the suffering he causes sound like lip service rather than compassion and more than once you may find yourself asking how or why this saloon full of lushes could ever have loved this Hickey as they did.  Where Robards lays on a healing balm, Marvin demands a stiff upper lip. Hickey's major soliloquy is couched in loving sentiment until its end when a vital angry truth escapes him and lays him low, but Marvin's rendition is so full of uncontrolled rage and venom that it leaves no room for surprise or contrast when it finishes, gutting so much of the play's force.Still, if you can stand the sensation of listening to fingernails scratch the blackboard when Marvin's Hickey is in play, the AFT versions offers a magnificent performance by Robert Ryan as Larry Slade, the former anarchist and self-described fence-sitter who strives to remain detached from humanity's struggles even while still being deeply affected by them.  The AFT DVD cover identifies Ryan's major prior roles in ""The Wild Bunch"" and ""The Dirty Dozen,"" both the kind of violent action films that seem to be in Marvin's DNA.  But in Iceman, when Hickey is on the sideline, there are breathtaking stretches in which others talk and Ryan, playing the hollowed out Slade, listens while his face flickers with a Buddha-like humanity that makes one want to cry.  The Richard Gere of ""Pretty Woman"" has travelled a similarly long road from Hollywood schlock to the deeper humanity found in his performance of the eviscerated cop of ""Brooklyn's Finest"" who long ago lost any connection with ideals that once gave life meaning and yet has to struggle on in a life without them.  Ryan's performance alone - and there are other treats as well such as Tom Pedi's reprise of his BTA role as bartender Rocky - may be worth the price of admission.December 29, 2012",2,Miscast Lee

Especially in today's fast paced, ""I want it now world"".  However, those four hours seem to go by in minutes as one is mesmerized by both the story and the acting.As a former bar dweller, I can identify with these poor souls who spend their days pontificating over nothing adn drinking to escape.Not wanting to bore you with a long winded review, (there are far more better reviews here than I could ever offer), I will give one thought.In the end we discover why Marvin's character stopped drinking, and when we are met with this revelation we also realize why he was so intent on challenging his fellow barmates to change.He ended his life the night before for all intents and purposes.  My view is that he was not attempting to humiliate any of them, but to save them from the fate he was about to suffer.Of all the characters, in the end it seems he was able to save one, Robert Ryan's character.  THe rest go on and on with their daily routines of dreaming, avoiding and drinking.I am so happy that this masterpiece was finally offered up on DVD.

742720,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,B00008HCA9,Randy Keehn,"[9, 9]","Back in the early 1970's, a group called the American Film Theater conceived the idea of bringing the stage to larger audiences by filming theater plays with all-star casts.  We all know plenty of stage productions that were turned into movies but they were adapted to the different medium.  Sometimes the script was changed, usually the sets were greatly expanded beyond what the stage could accommodate, supporting casts quadrupled, etc.  What the AFT intended was along the lines of many Shakespearian film productions where the focus was on the actors and the script rather than the action and the locations.  I remember that there were a limited number of productions (14) that were filmed.  I recall ""Rhinoceros"" by Ionesco (I think) but the one that caught my eye was ""The Iceman Cometh"" both for the play and for the cast.The AFT productions, as I recall, were not intended for the general theater distribution.  They were, instead, intended to be a special release for a limited set of venues.  I saw ""The Iceman Cometh"" in Madison, Wisconsin in 1976.  I was impressed enough by the film that I went out and read the play.""The Iceman Cometh"" has a rather complex message that tells the tale of a reformed alcohlic that revisits one of his hangouts to try and reform the dead-enders that inhabit the tavern.  The opening scene lets us know just how down and out this clientele is; most of them are coming to in the morning at the chairs they passed out in the night before.  Larry Slade (played by Robert Ryan) is the lone person who is awake besides the bartender.  As the other come to, we see a group of people who have descended to the lowest point within their reach.  The one thing they all look forward to is the arrival of Hickey who comes every year to celebrate Harry Hope's birthday.  Hope is the ironically named owner of the tavern and is played by Frederick March.  Hickey eventually arives but this time he is out to reform the bunch and get them to throw away their pipe dreams and face reality.  The play deals with their attempts to folow his advice and their reaction to their efforts.  It is also about Hickey's inability to comprehend his own advice.  Is the message that turning a new leaf is easier said than done?  ""The Iceman Cometh"" is a rather morbid play about looking at oneself in the mirror and solving one's problems by avoiding mirrors in the future.The brilliance of this movie is in the outstanding acting.  Special kudos go out to the three most recognizable names in the cast; Robert Ryan, Frederick March, and Lee Marvin who plays Hickey.  Of the three, I would give the nod to Ryan if I had to pick the best preformance.  However, John Frankenheimer deserves special recognition as well for directing for the stage while making it for film audiences.  In many scenes, as the attention shifts from one group of characters to another, the other actors hold their poses in the background so as not to disturb the focus of the audience.  That's how it's done on the stage and that's how it's done in ""The Iceman Cometh"".  The set is nothing more than you would find on stage; we get the feel of Broadway in our own hometown and now, thanks the release of the DVD, we get that feel in our own living room.
