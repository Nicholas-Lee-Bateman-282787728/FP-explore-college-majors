1299851,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B002ZCY84U,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[1, 2]","I LOVE ""Human Target: The Complete First Season""! It is 21st century escapist TV adventure at it's best, with cinematic sweep, wonderful characterizations, tongue-in-cheek humor, and wall-to-wall action. It captures the action/adventure genre so well that it is easy to forget it's a weekly television series, shot in eight days on a limited budget. The episodes 'feel' like movies, right down to the rousing symphonic scores (composed by Bear McCreary), and the superb production design (by David Willson).Based, very loosely, on an intriguing 1970s 'second-feature' DC Comics series, created by the legendary Len Wein and Carmine Infantino, the original concept (with Christopher Chance, a la ""Mission Impossible"" master of disguise Rollin Hand, using plastic surgery and other means to 'become' potential targets, while his own persona remained a cypher), had been attempted, unsuccessfully, as a series in 1992, with Rick Springfield as Chance; the reliance on disguise damaged the TV audience's ability to bond with the lead, so the concept was 'tweaked' with Chance (now portrayed with easy-going charm by Mark Valley), becoming a bodyguard/protector rather than a clone, and still a 'human target' for potential assassins. Valley's Chance is an enigma, an ex-assassin who 'walked away' after the murder of a loved one, and with his friends/colleagues, ex-police detective Laverne Winston (husky, authoritative Chi McBride), and intense, deceptively dangerous Guerrero (the fabulous Jackie Earle Haley), they take on impossible 'David/Goliath' jobs, around the globe.While a storyline occasionally stretches credibility (Chance flying a passenger jet upside-down to put out a fire in the undercarriage), or historic accuracy (in one episode he protects the 'Princess of Wales', Heir Apparent to a rather young-looking British Queen...uh, Elizabeth?), it is done so quickly, and with such panache, that you'll shrug and go along for the ride.

1299853,A1PZSNVVQ7G73I,B002ZCY84U,"B Huck ""Bonkers for Blu Ray""","[0, 0]","Season one of Human Target is nearly a perfect intro to a great show. In this season, the lead character, Christopher Chance, takes on other identities to get the job done. Each identity demands specific skills, one even required him to be fluent in Japanese. The show also prides itself on fresh action sequences and inventive fight scenes, such as a big brawl in the upper duct of an airplane. Imagine trying to throw some hay-makers in a 3 foot crawl space. Very fun stuff. Plus, you get some sweet cameos, including the oh so cool, Lee Majors.Season 2 completely changed this fresh format to just the main character doing rescue missions with very little ""assuming someone's identity"" to achieve his goal, so for me, season to is a pass!The real winner for season one is the dynamic between the three main characters. Three dudes who all see things a little differently, but still have respect for one another, often to help save each other's skin. If you've never seen this show, pick up season one and treat yourself. If you're already a fan, then what are you waiting for. Season one on blu ray...with bonus features...can't go wrong. There's a great documentary on what it was like trying to make ""a full on action movie"" each week on a tight budget.The lead actor, Mark Valley, is terrific. This show really fits his personality. He tends to get on all these legal dramas, so I was really hoping to see this show last 5 or 6 seasons, but for some reason, the ratings just weren't there. It had a very similar vibe to USA Network's ""Burn Notice"" which is still going strong.

Winston, the head of this secret operative group, is brought to life, sizzling life, by Chi McBride (Boston Public).  The odd man out, Guerrero, is given such a mysterious allure by Jackie Earle Haley (various film and television roles).These three form a triad which keeps you guessing week from week about their motivations, their past and their apparent commitment to each other.

1299891,A1AST89AHN17O7,B002ZCY84U,Omnes,"[1, 1]","Inspired by a DC Comics called Human Target, Jonathan A Steinberg offers us a variation of this series. In his show, Christopher Chance's job is to protect his clients from any threats (direct or indirect) not by taking the identity of his clients, but instead by using a fake identity which will allow him to immerse in his client's life. Along with his colleagues, which consist of Winston, an ex-detective, and Guerrero, a hacker-hit-man from Chance's past, each episode involves a different client and a new identity to adopt during the course of this twelve episodes season. Although some people complained about such a short season format when they would have preferred sixteen or twenty three episodes, the chosen length  didn't bother me at all. As long as the scripts and visual effects were in great quality, I didn't mind watching a short season action show.The only things that did annoy me however were the times I managed to glimpse Canada Post truck and letterboxes in episodes that were happening in San Francisco or in New York. Not only that, at the beginning of the fourth episode, there is also a helicopter shot of that french-Canadian monastery, and by judging the architecture of the building and the mountains, that shot seemed to have been done not in Canada, but in a Californian location. So that simple detail reminded to me that this episode hadn't been shot in that province, and it broke the illusion of the episode. Apart from that, I am amazed how the Vancouver visual artists did a good job in their computer graphic effects, especially in the second episode with that airplane and in the sixth episode with that skydiving introduction. As for the orchestral soundtrack, it is excellent and makes the opening credits, and Chance's missions, epic and unforgettable.Meanwhile, the scripts' plot lines and dialogues were well written and had enough suspense to keep you in your seat and make you wonder how Chance and his colleagues would get out of their mess. I also appreciated the interactions between the three main characters  and I can say that of all the three characters, my favorite is Guerrero. His character is so unpredictable that you are never too sure what he will do if you provoke him. Kudos to Haley's performance which allowed the character to not be a pilot appearance, but an essential character for the series. His interactions with Winston were funny and uplifted the mood of the show. Of the twelve episodes, my favorites would be the second, the eight episode, and the finale. Which concludes in the opening of the second season.In the end, this show really stands as proof that you can do action shows with both high production values and excellent scripts.",5,What a treat!,1332547200,"03 24, 2012",2012,2715,"['Inspired', 'DC', 'Comics', 'called', 'Human', 'Target', 'Jonathan', 'A', 'Steinberg', 'variation', 'series', 'show', 'Christopher', 'Chance', 'job', 'protect', 'clients', 'threats', 'direct', 'indirect', 'not', 'taking', 'identity', 'clients', 'instead', 'using', 'fake', 'identity', 'will', 'allow', 'immerse', 'client', 'life', 'colleagues', 'consist', 'Winston', 'ex-detective', 'Guerrero', 'hacker-hit-man', 'Chance', 'past', 'episode', 'different', 'client', 'new', 'identity', 'adopt', 'course', 'twelve', 'season', 'people', 'complained', 'short', 'season', 'format', 'when', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'sixteen', 'twenty', 'three', 'episodes', 'chosen', 'length', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'As', 'long', 'scripts', 'visual', 'effects', 'were', 'great', 'quality', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'watching', 'short', 'season', 'action', 'only', 'things', 'did', 'annoy', 'however', 'were', 'times', 'managed', 'glimpse', 'Canada', 'Post', 'truck', 'letterboxes', 'episodes', 'were', 'happening', 'San', 'Francisco', 'New', 'York', 'Not', 'only', 'beginning', 'fourth', 'episode', 'also', 'helicopter', 'shot', 'french-Canadian', 'monastery', 'judging', 'architecture', 'building', 'mountains', 'shot', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'not', 'Canada', 'Californian', 'location', 'simple', 'detail', 'reminded', 'episode', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'shot', 'province', 'broke', 'illusion', 'episode', 'Apart', 'am', 'amazed', 'how', 'Vancouver', 'visual', 'artists', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'computer', 'graphic', 'effects', 'especially', 'second', 'episode', 'airplane', 'sixth', 'episode', 'skydiving', 'introduction', 'orchestral', 'soundtrack', 'excellent', 'opening', 'credits', 'Chance', 'missions', 'epic', 'unforgettable.Meanwhile', 'scripts', 'plot', 'lines', 'dialogues', 'were', 'well', 'written', 'had', 'enough', 'suspense', 'keep', 'seat', 'make', 'wonder', 'how', 'Chance', 'colleagues', 'would', 'get', 'mess', 'also', 'appreciated', 'interactions', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'can', 'say', 'three', 'characters', 'favorite', 'Guerrero', 'character', 'so', 'unpredictable', 'are', 'never', 'too', 'sure', 'what', 'will', 'do', 'provoke', 'Kudos', 'Haley', 'performance', 'allowed', 'character', 'not', 'be', 'pilot', 'appearance', 'essential', 'character', 'series', 'interactions', 'Winston', 'were', 'funny', 'uplifted', 'mood', 'show', 'twelve', 'episodes', 'favorites', 'would', 'be', 'second', 'eight', 'episode', 'finale', 'Which', 'opening', 'second', 'season.In', 'end', 'show', 'really', 'proof', 'can', 'do', 'action', 'shows', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'excellent', 'scripts']",N/A

Sure, you have to check your sense of reality at the door, suspend your belief in what you know can and simply cannot happen to one man's body through most all of these fights, but all that aside, there is nothing like it on TV at this time - and hasn't been (save, perhaps in parts, '24') for a long time.Part James Bond, part Indiana Jones (even the music from Bear McCreary is created with that subtle triumphant Indy swagger to it after he wins a battle!), 'Human Target' takes us all over America with Christoper Chance, played in fine style by Mark Velley (Boston Legal).The twelve episodes are well crafted and brilliantly acted, but when you have the always-awesome Chi McBride (Boston Public) on your side, here in the form of Winston, the head of this secret operative group, well, you know (the sadly UNDERappreciated 'Pushing Daisies,' anyone?!) you've got a winner of a show on your hands! Also, the odd (little) man out, Guerrero, is given such a mysterious allure by Jackie Earle Haley (Watchmen) that you can't help but think of him as a snuggly, uncaged (pet) rat!That said, and getting just a little bit quirky about certain things that tend to repeat, Guerrero HAS to stop saying ""Dude"" every other sentence; Baptiste (Lennie James - 'Jericho') HAS to stop saying ""Mate"" every other sentence; and Chance a) has to lose some of that belly fat for the second season (come on now people, you know this is true!), and b) has to start to limp once or twice - the amount of complete and utter beatings he gets each episode!BUT, hold the presses ... the truly beautiful, and so talented Emmaunelle Vaugier (Two and a Half Men) as the fearless FBI Special Agent Emma Barnes, is a perfect match for Mark Valley's Christopher Chance.

This is the second attempt to make ""Human Target"" into a TV series--the first time was with actor/singer Rick Springfield in the lead. It lasted seven episode. This version of ""Human Target"" successfully jumps the gap nicely captures the best elements of the comic series created by Len Wein and Carmine Infantino and adding elements that make the concept work better for TV.""Human Target"" focuses on Christopher Chance (Mark Valley)who along with his partner former police detective Winston (Chi McBride) provides private protection as a last resort for those in danger of being killed. Chance and Winston rely on a former assassin who can find out anything named Guerrero (Jackie Earl Haley)to discover who is trying to kill their clients in high octane action driven episodes. In the original comic book Chance would take on the identity of the target but here he inserts himself into their lives to protect them.""Human Target"" is a terrific show--well written, directed and made. Mark Valley who appeared on ""Fringe"" and ""Boston Legal"" perfectly captures Chance's character. Haley and McBride are both perfect for their roles bringing jus the right level of levity and seriousness to the show. Jackie Earl Haley (who was in the original ""The Bad News Bears"" and ""Watchmen"")does a terrific job as does Chi MacBride from ""Pushing Dasies"" and ""The Frighteners"".The Blu-ray has a crisp, colorful picture. Audio sounds quite good although it's not lossless.We get a featurette on the transition from print to screen, a featurette on the action sequences on the show as well as a commentary track on the pilot episode with Valley, McBride and writer/executive producer Jonathan Steinberg.""Human Target"" manages to capture the fun qualities of the original character and translate it to the TV screen.

1299905,A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9,B002ZCY84U,William Amazzini,"[1, 1]","Fox was always way ahead of the major networks in the action genre department as the seasons of '24' can attest to.  Now we have 'HUMAN TARGET', a high octaine well acted series which will also appeal to non action viewers.  Mark Valley owns the series and finally, he gets to show off his under appreciated acting talents as he molds  the character of Christopher Chance into a complex, honorable hero.  Valley failed to click with audiences in the underrated British set series 'KEEN EDDIE' and was the memorable boyfriend lover of character Olivia Dunham in Fox's other hit 'FRINGE' and its fitting that both Valley and Anna Torv are married in real life.  Chi Mcbride ,who I always thought never got a great role since his stint as the principal in the great series 'BOSTON PUBLIC' is Chance's assistant and plays it tongue in cheek as a detective who got the dirty end of the stick and now devotes his life to Chance after witnessing the tragic murder of his wife.  And last but not least the excellent, lethal character of Guerraro played eccentrically by Jackie Earle Hailey and who I feel stole the film 'WATCHMEN' from everybody else , is linked to Chance in more ways than one.  The series is produced, written and directed by the best action people in the business and I defy anyone who sees the 'PILOT' episode directed by Simon West not to think it could rank among the best theatrical action films.  I missed quite a bit of the episodes on this first run so it was a joy to watch them uninterrupted.  The new season has the introduction of two female leads in the mix and for what I have seen, the series has not lost its impetus.  Sadly, there are rumors that 'HUMAN TARGET' may have a cult audience but not enough for it to return for a third season which would be a tragedy. Warner Home video includes excellent featurettes on the making of the series and includes interviews with its main actors. The episodes are presented in widescreen Dolby Digital sound for an excellent aural experience.
