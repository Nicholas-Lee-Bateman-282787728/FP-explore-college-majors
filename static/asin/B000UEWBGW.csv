Instead it shows the struggles of passing the bar exam.  It almost made me feel sorry for future lawyers as they put their heart and soul into passing the exam.  Then I thought about the movie ""Catch Me if you can"" based on true events where a con man passed the bar and pretended to be a lawyer and this guy didn't go to law school.  Then I thought about the tv show Smarter than a 5th grader where they have all these smart people who fail to answer all the questions.  So my point is that maybe the bar exam is hard with such a bad passing rate because law schools are not teaching the right things to  pass it.  That would explain how a con man was able to pass the bar exam with no law school and why so many people can't win at the tv show Smarter than a fifth grader because who uses or remember the info that was taught in fifth grade.",4,Almost felt sad,1228262400,"12 3, 2008",2008,978,"['watch', 'video', 'thought', 'would', 'give', 'Joe', 'average', 'view', 'point', 'how', 'legal', 'system', ""n't"", 'do', 'Instead', 'struggles', 'passing', 'bar', 'exam', 'almost', 'made', 'feel', 'sorry', 'future', 'lawyers', 'put', 'heart', 'soul', 'passing', 'exam', 'Then', 'thought', 'movie', 'Catch', 'Me', 'can', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'where', 'con', 'man', 'passed', 'bar', 'pretended', 'be', 'lawyer', 'guy', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'law', 'school', 'Then', 'thought', 'tv', 'show', 'Smarter', '5th', 'grader', 'where', 'have', 'smart', 'people', 'who', 'fail', 'answer', 'questions', 'So', 'point', 'maybe', 'bar', 'exam', 'hard', 'bad', 'passing', 'rate', 'law', 'schools', 'are', 'not', 'teaching', 'right', 'things', 'pass', 'would', 'explain', 'how', 'con', 'man', 'was', 'able', 'pass', 'bar', 'exam', 'law', 'school', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'win', 'tv', 'show', 'Smarter', 'fifth', 'grader', 'who', 'remember', 'info', 'was', 'taught', 'fifth', 'grade']",N/A

This is no small feat, especially in California, which boasts a low of about 39% pass rate, making it the toughest such exam among the 50 states.  This documentary follows the stories of a half-dozen law school grads and wannabe's who face this final hurdle in transforming their J.D. into something that can pay the bills.Prep courses, family stresses, sleepless nights, the pressure to perform, financial stress - add up to a cocktail of tension as thousands of law grads convene in a Civic Center for three days to pass the California bar.  Who will make it and who will fail?Added interest flows from cameos from prominent attorneys, including Scott Turow, Alan Dershowitz, Robert Shapiro, Mark Lanier, Victor Schwartz and Joe Jamail.Whether you are an attorney or not (I am not), or just interested in the law and the roles that lawyers play in our society, this movie is well worth 90 minutes of your time for its high drama.",5,Fascinating Look at the Gauntlet of Becoming a Lawyer,1209168000,"04 26, 2008",2008,995,"['Beyond', 'law', 'school', 'challenge', 'passing', 'Bar', 'exam', 'small', 'feat', 'especially', 'California', 'low', 'about', '39', '%', 'pass', 'rate', 'making', 'toughest', 'such', 'exam', '50', 'states', 'documentary', 'stories', 'half-dozen', 'law', 'school', 'grads', 'wannabe', 'who', 'face', 'final', 'hurdle', 'transforming', 'J.D', 'something', 'can', 'pay', 'bills.Prep', 'courses', 'family', 'stresses', 'sleepless', 'nights', 'pressure', 'perform', 'financial', 'stress', 'add', 'up', 'cocktail', 'tension', 'thousands', 'law', 'grads', 'convene', 'Civic', 'Center', 'three', 'days', 'pass', 'California', 'bar', 'Who', 'will', 'make', 'who', 'will', 'fail', 'Added', 'interest', 'cameos', 'prominent', 'attorneys', 'including', 'Scott', 'Turow', 'Alan', 'Dershowitz', 'Robert', 'Shapiro', 'Mark', 'Lanier', 'Victor', 'Schwartz', 'Joe', 'Jamail.Whether', 'are', 'attorney', 'not', 'am', 'not', 'just', 'interested', 'law', 'roles', 'lawyers', 'play', 'society', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', '90', 'minutes', 'time', 'high', 'drama']",N/A

That's four times the numbers of lawyers in the WHOLE WORLD. And 130,000 more lawyers graduate each year from our law schools. That's just one of the facts in ""A Lawyer Walks Into a Bar.""The only downside to this fun and fact-filled documentary is when it focuses on one of the annoyingly whiny ""this-is-so-hard"" law students who, after being involved in a very minor fender bender, calls her attorney FIRST and expresses her desire to initiate litigation for her ""pain and suffering."" When she appeared on screen, I wanted to *mute* the tv rather than listen to her self-serving diatribe and inane ramblings.Fortunately, that was a small part of the overall picture.The story is focused on law students in Los Angeles and makes the point that law school tuition runs $30,000 to $40,000 per year, leaving these students with few choices but to start making $75,000 a year right off the bat. Those with high ideals and hopes to make America a better place for the poor and needy, really don't have many options, because of the high debts and student loans.My husband is a trial attorney and when I first met him (thanks to Match.com), I wasn't sure if I wanted to pursue a relationship with a trial attorney. Yeah, he was a better than the vinyl-siding salesman (whom I ditched during the first phone call), but a trial attorney? Yikes. But he made the point (as does Nancy Grace in this film) that when you're under attack in the courtroom, you need a smart-cookie attorney defending you and pleading your case and/or your cause.It's a good film and it's kind to attorneys and yet, one of the best parts is the ""bonus"" feature that shows scum-sucking bottom dwellers chasing ambulances in hopes of making a few fast bucks.
