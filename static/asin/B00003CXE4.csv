522807,A26GKRY72ROT25,B00003CXE4,"Amazon Customer ""HomeTheaterGuy""","[0, 0]","When I saw the previews of this movie, I couldn't wait to go see it. It looked like it was going to be one of the funniest movies to hit the big screen. When I was walking out of the theater, after finally seeing it, I realized that the preview was so funny because they used ALL the funniest parts of the movie to make it! It's strange; I never laughed so hard watching a movie that I truly didn't like. But...I figured that I had to give some of the gags another chance, maybe some of them went over my head, maybe I was distracted or somehow I missed something. I had that same problem with ""Dumb & Dumber"", and after watching it for a few times, I really liked the movie...Allot! So I borrowed the movie from a friend of mine and sat down to give it a second chance and the next day I gave it a third chance. I have to admit, after the third time I was able to enjoy it more then when I saw it for the first time in the theater. That being said, I still think it's a really bad movie with some hysterical gags sprinkled through out the flick. The story goes like this; Charlie Baileygates (played by Jim Carrey) is a cop for the Rhode Island state police, a real nice guy and gets absolutely no respect from anyone. He becomes the laughing stock when his wife bares the illegitimate children of a man who's a genius, black and a midget. Then she decides she wants to be with her lover permanently and without the 3 kids. After years of being disrespected, laughed at and ridiculed by just about everyone he knows, he has a mental break down, develops a split personality, Hank, which is the total opposite of Charlie. Hank is a nasty, rude, aggressive, ...kind of guy. This is unfortunate for Charlie since he's the one who bares the repercussions of Hanks actions. The movie seems like it had the potential to be something great, but just never got there. Unlike Dumb and Dumber or Ace Ventura, this movie falls short because there's not enough comedy to compensate for a sub-par movie. Whereas ""Ace Ventura"", had enough ""potentially funny"" gags to let Jim's brilliant comedic performance turn them into hysterical gags that carried the movie. Also, Jim Carrey is starting to become another Robin Williams, where as he's the same character in every movie he does (regardless of the story or plot). What I found to be a plus was the quality of the DVD. The THX certified disc sounded very good (unlike the way it did in the theater where I first saw it), with the dialogue holding firm and at the right moments, the sub and surrounds kicking in to really accent the scene. This might even be one of the mitigating factors that actually help me enjoy the movie more. My final verdict is; this is strictly one to rent!!!! If you are looking for a movie that was able to accomplish what this one couldn't (and you don't own it yet) buy Dumb & Dumber!",2,Not enough laughs to carry this awful movie!,988761600,"05 2, 2001",2001,2851,"['When', 'saw', 'previews', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'go', 'see', 'looked', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', 'hit', 'big', 'screen', 'When', 'was', 'walking', 'theater', 'finally', 'seeing', 'realized', 'preview', 'was', 'so', 'funny', 'used', 'funniest', 'parts', 'movie', 'make', 'strange', 'never', 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'watching', 'movie', 'truly', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'figured', 'had', 'give', 'gags', 'chance', 'maybe', 'went', 'head', 'maybe', 'was', 'distracted', 'somehow', 'missed', 'something', 'had', 'same', 'problem', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'watching', 'few', 'times', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'Allot', 'So', 'borrowed', 'movie', 'friend', 'mine', 'sat', 'down', 'give', 'second', 'chance', 'next', 'day', 'gave', 'third', 'chance', 'have', 'admit', 'third', 'time', 'was', 'able', 'enjoy', 'more', 'then', 'when', 'saw', 'first', 'time', 'theater', 'being', 'said', 'still', 'think', 'really', 'bad', 'movie', 'hysterical', 'gags', 'sprinkled', 'flick', 'story', 'Charlie', 'Baileygates', 'played', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'cop', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'state', 'police', 'real', 'nice', 'guy', 'absolutely', 'respect', 'anyone', 'laughing', 'stock', 'when', 'wife', 'illegitimate', 'children', 'man', 'who', 'genius', 'black', 'midget', 'Then', 'be', 'permanently', '3', 'kids', 'years', 'being', 'disrespected', 'laughed', 'ridiculed', 'just', 'everyone', 'mental', 'break', 'down', 'split', 'personality', 'Hank', 'total', 'opposite', 'Charlie', 'Hank', 'nasty', 'rude', 'aggressive', 'kind', 'guy', 'unfortunate', 'Charlie', 'one', 'who', 'repercussions', 'Hanks', 'actions', 'movie', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'something', 'great', 'just', 'never', 'got', 'there', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'Ace', 'Ventura', 'movie', 'short', 'not', 'enough', 'comedy', 'compensate', 'sub-par', 'movie', 'Ace', 'Ventura', 'had', 'enough', 'potentially', 'funny', 'gags', 'let', 'Jim', 'brilliant', 'comedic', 'performance', 'turn', 'hysterical', 'gags', 'carried', 'movie', 'Also', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'starting', 'become', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'where', 'same', 'character', 'movie', 'regardless', 'story', 'plot', 'What', 'found', 'be', 'plus', 'was', 'quality', 'DVD', 'THX', 'certified', 'disc', 'sounded', 'very', 'good', 'way', 'did', 'theater', 'where', 'first', 'saw', 'dialogue', 'holding', 'firm', 'right', 'moments', 'sub', 'kicking', 'really', 'accent', 'scene', 'might', 'even', 'be', 'one', 'mitigating', 'factors', 'actually', 'help', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'more', 'final', 'verdict', 'strictly', 'one', 'rent', 'are', 'looking', 'movie', 'was', 'able', 'accomplish', 'what', 'one', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'yet', 'buy', 'Dumb', 'Dumber']",N/A

That's what I expected from Me, Myself & Irene.  Honestly, that wasn't too thrilling.  And while it's certainly the perfect vehicle for his gymnastic style comedy, it's also a Farrelly Brother's production - rejoining Carrey with the director team of There's Something About Mary and KingPin.  Their first collaboration was Dumb and Dumber  - the hit film that made Carrey an international superstar.  Here, they return to their roots in what at first appears to be a simple road trip movie similar to Dumb and Dumber, but soon explodes into an outrageous farcical exploration of one man's - or is that two - battle with multiple personality disorder.If there's a single ongoing theme in most Farrelly movies, it's the disabled and their place in our society, or lack thereof.  Besides mawkish TV movies and occasional theatrical roles, the disabled are relegated to the sidelines in most forms of popular entertainment.  However in Bobby and Peter Farrelly's twisted slices of American life, the crippled, mentally challenged and down right psychotic all get a chance to shine.  Some may cringe when they see these characters on the receiving end of so much abuse, or giving it for that matter, but it's refreshing to see disabled characters period in mainstream cinema.  Here multiple personality disorder is mined for laughs until you feel guilty for laughing, but you will laugh.Both Farrellys hold court on their film with a great audio commentary and it's clear they had a ball making the film.  Surprisingly, these guys for all the outrageous vulgar shenanigans they concoct, are pretty laid back, normal, even modest people.  Certainly the affection they hold for their home state of Rhode Island must endear them to folks back home.This movie really surprised me.  Early on I dismissed it as another Jim Carrey payday with him mugging wildly for the cameras.  And that said, he definitely doesn't turn in a subtle performance.  However, after viewing this film, even Jim Carrey detractors would have to admit he's one of the most accomplished physical comedians to ever grace the silver screen.  Overall this is an extremely funny and original film.  The entire supporting cast really delivers.  I consistenly found myself going back over scenes to laugh again and again at the gags.  At times the bits may go on too long and the subject matter may push the envelope well beyond repair and good taste, but somehow it all comes together and works beautifully despite a thin plot.",4,Mutliple Personality Zaniness,1154995200,"08 8, 2006",2006,2605,"['Jim', 'Carrey', 'vehicle.Jim', 'Carrey', 'bouncing', 'off', 'walls', 'ceiling', 'anything', 'else', 'camp', 'up', 'what', 'expected', 'Me', 'Myself', 'Irene', 'Honestly', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'thrilling', 'certainly', 'perfect', 'vehicle', 'gymnastic', 'style', 'comedy', 'also', 'Farrelly', 'Brother', 'production', 'rejoining', 'Carrey', 'director', 'team', 'Something', 'Mary', 'KingPin', 'first', 'collaboration', 'was', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'hit', 'film', 'made', 'Carrey', 'international', 'superstar', 'Here', 'return', 'roots', 'what', 'first', 'be', 'simple', 'road', 'trip', 'movie', 'similar', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'soon', 'explodes', 'outrageous', 'farcical', 'exploration', 'one', 'man', 'two', 'battle', 'multiple', 'personality', 'disorder.If', 'single', 'ongoing', 'theme', 'most', 'Farrelly', 'movies', 'disabled', 'place', 'society', 'lack', 'thereof', 'mawkish', 'TV', 'movies', 'occasional', 'theatrical', 'roles', 'disabled', 'are', 'relegated', 'sidelines', 'most', 'forms', 'popular', 'entertainment', 'However', 'Bobby', 'Peter', 'Farrelly', 'twisted', 'slices', 'American', 'life', 'crippled', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'down', 'right', 'psychotic', 'get', 'chance', 'shine', 'may', 'cringe', 'when', 'see', 'characters', 'receiving', 'end', 'so', 'much', 'abuse', 'giving', 'matter', 'refreshing', 'see', 'disabled', 'characters', 'period', 'mainstream', 'cinema', 'Here', 'multiple', 'personality', 'disorder', 'mined', 'laughs', 'feel', 'guilty', 'laughing', 'will', 'laugh.Both', 'Farrellys', 'hold', 'court', 'film', 'great', 'audio', 'commentary', 'clear', 'had', 'ball', 'making', 'film', 'Surprisingly', 'guys', 'outrageous', 'vulgar', 'shenanigans', 'concoct', 'are', 'pretty', 'laid', 'back', 'normal', 'even', 'modest', 'people', 'Certainly', 'affection', 'hold', 'home', 'state', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'must', 'endear', 'folks', 'back', 'home.This', 'movie', 'really', 'surprised', 'Early', 'dismissed', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'payday', 'mugging', 'wildly', 'cameras', 'said', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'turn', 'subtle', 'performance', 'However', 'viewing', 'film', 'even', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'detractors', 'would', 'have', 'admit', 'one', 'most', 'accomplished', 'physical', 'comedians', 'ever', 'grace', 'silver', 'screen', 'Overall', 'extremely', 'funny', 'original', 'film', 'entire', 'supporting', 'cast', 'really', 'consistenly', 'found', 'going', 'back', 'scenes', 'laugh', 'again', 'again', 'gags', 'times', 'bits', 'may', 'go', 'too', 'long', 'subject', 'matter', 'may', 'push', 'envelope', 'well', 'repair', 'good', 'taste', 'somehow', 'together', 'beautifully', 'thin', 'plot']",N/A

There is so much potential here, and even some of the jokes start off verging on hilarious and then get beaten so far to death that you can't muster enough energy to utter a mere chuckle.  I mean, this is Jim Carrey we're talking about here.  The world knows that this guy is funny.This SHOULD have been gold!The films premise is rather simple.  A `nice guy' named Charlie, who also happens to be a cop, gets walked all over by everybody, including his two-timing wife.  When he's finally taken all that he can handle, Hank, his alter-ego bares his crude little head and starts wrecking havoc, reacting to those who take advantage so that Charlie can gain an ounce of respect.  That really is the only part of the plot that matters, since the ridiculous `witness protection' aspect of the plot is rather forgettable.There are some gags here that really work (the cow scene still brings me to near-pee fits of laughter), some that entertain a chuckle (the nose whistle comes very close to getting a full on barrel from me) and then a slew that just seem to be rather, well, bare (what is it with films that consider vulgar language a joke in itself?).Jim Carrey handles the material the best he can, and his tonal shifts and deadpan delivery tinged with sarcasm is quite effective when the material matches his delivery (the ""taco"" speech in the grocery store was quite funny) but all too often the material isn't a match and Carrey comes across rather desperate, like he's reaching to find some kernels of funny in this very un-funny script.And don't even get me started on the wasted opportunity that was the three ghetto genius sons...I mean, that should have been a home run and wound up being a major foul!In the end I have to give this one a D+.

522814,A3LVA6QDZIOBGE,B00003CXE4,Ashegam,"[4, 10]","A Farrelly brother movie has a certain feel. There's always a uniqueness, always taking it one step further than the normal person would - Jim Carrey lighting his farts in Dumb and Dumber, Woody Harrelson &quot;milking the cow&quot; in Kingpin, The singer in There's Something About Mary - but this film doesn't have that. The closest it gets is with the character &quot;Whitey&quot; - and for about 5 minutes it feels like a Farrelly brothers movie. Laughing so hard you don't catch the next joke.I wonder why this happened and would assume that the pressure of having a 20 million dollar actor changes the way a writer and director would write and act. There are some funny parts in this, don't get me wrong. The dwarf limo driver stealing his girlfriend, his young boys who are &quot;tan all year long,&quot; but that's the point - the funny parts generally involve subplots and the movie focuses too hard on Carrey/Zellweger. Carrey is only funny as Hank, and only remotely. Drowning the child, etc. But the movie just doesn't ever switch it into high gear. I think my point can best be explained at the very end of the movie, during the credits. They show a cut scene where Whitey is looking through his binoculars/glasses and sees an airplane - in the film, he just sees people. In the cut scene, he sees someone mooning the world out of the window. Another cut scene, involves an 'American Pie' type scene, where Jim makes love to a watermelon. The scene was cut, but there's still a watermelon in the corner of the room in the movie, with a strange hole in the middle.I can't quite explain why this movie just didn't do it - and therein I would encourage you to see it.

My personal highlight is after he confronts the mom and he's driving back, if you've seen the film you know what I mean.Once he is ordered to escort the prisoner the jokes start to fall a little flat and you are wanting the evil personality to come back to inject some much needed comedy into the film. The film trundles along to the obvious climactic finish but we have to suffer the obvious fight between the good and bad personalities which might have been good apart from the feeling of Jim milking it for all it's worth.I found the film to be a little muddled and by the end of the film I was wanting to see more of the evil personality as Jim was excellent with that part of the role.

The day he gets married, his wife has an affair with the limo driver, but he denies it, and they have three kids together. He loves them like they were his own, although they look nothing alike. Eventually his wife leaves him for the limo driver, but he gets custody of the kids. Now we flash forward and now his kids are grown up, and while on duty, he gets taken advantaged of some more until when he was in the store, he gets taken advantaged AGAIN by a woman who tells Charlie he just has a few groceries, but instead has like four cart loads of them. Finally, after taking all the crap from everyone, Hank comes out. Hank is the alter-ego of Charlie; he takes no crap, and he dishes out to everyone. So he is dianoised as a schizofranic and has to take meds for it. Now comes in Irene, she is a woman who needs to be driven across country because she is wanted for a crime. So he takes her, and from the ride, Hank comes out, and dishes out some more crap and eventually he has to get supplies: a &quot;woman's pleasure&quot; toy, a bottle of wine, and a couple of other things.

This is the very lowest form of comedy.  It is coarse, ribald and vulgar, a barrage of tasteless humor that runs the gamut from disgusting to offensive.  The Farrelly brothers burst onto the scene with ""Dumb and Dumber"", another ridiculous film with shallow humor that the masses ate like candy.  They began to show some promise with ""There's Something About Mary"", but then they decided we haven't been insulted enough lately and they produced this tripe.Jim Carrey is a brilliantly talented comedian.  After ""The Truman Show"" and ""Man on the Moon"", it seemed like he was progressing as a comedian beyond excrement humor.  I'm sure this film made him a truckload of money, but it is a relapse into fatuousness and a step backward in his career.There are plenty of funny scenes in this film.  Carrey is a funny guy.  However, there is also a passel of gross-out and gutter humor, which can only be targeted at pubescent or moronic individuals.  The film takes insulting pot shots at blacks, women, and the disabled, and seems to revel in its own poor taste.  It is normally easy to get a laugh out of me, and I appreciate slapstick more than most, but the trend toward repugnant humor exhibited in films like this and ""Scary Movie"" is disheartening.  What is more disturbing is how successful they are.I rated this film a 4/10.  I don't need to trash it because it trashes itself.

However, this movie was a surprise. No one could pull off the scene where Charlie becomes Hank. Carrey's facial expressions make this movie what it is.Carrey is Charlie, your average everyday nice guy. He's an 18 year vet of &quot;The greatest police force in the world&quot; - the Rhode Island State troopers. Everything's going fine for him until his wife, the Mensa chapter president, has an affair with the height-challenged limo driver (also a  Mensa chapter Pres). She gives birth to three black triplets. The sons later turn out to be as foul-mouthed as they are intelligent. He knows his wife may be having an affair, but part of him doesn't want to believe it. Then one day, after a series of events that test his patience - his newspaper gets stolen, a little 5 year old girl gives him hell, the barbers are poking fun at his ex, and a woman cuts in front of the line at the grocery store with 6 full shopping carts; he snaps, and out comes Hank, his rude, crude alter ego. Then, Charlie/Hank is asked to escort Irene, a woman wanted as an accessory to tax evasion and bribery, which she knows nothing about from Rhode Island to upstate New York. Along the way, Charlie's wanted for murder as well as the mishaps he had as Hank, and he and Irene get into serious trouble. The biggest problem for both is when Charlie and Hank start to fall for Irene. What's the problem? She loves Charlie, hates Hank.This movie's hilarious. The funniest scene has to be when Carrey shoots the supposedly dead cow with six bullets. That beats the rabid dog that attacked Ben Stiller in There's Something About Mary any day.

This is my 2nd favorite Farrelly Brothers Comedy tied with Dumb and Dumber. But, really, I mean isn't it weird to see Jim Carrey in an R rated comedy? Sure he was in Man on the moon but I mean normally he's in PG-13 ones. (Dumb and Dumber, Bruce Almighty, Liar Liar, The Mask, etc..)This movie's plot is about Charley, a sweet Rhode Island who's way too nice and kind. When his wife cheats on him and leaves him, Charley has to raise 3 boys that aern't really his sons. They were the man with whom her wife was cheating with's sons. So here's Charley, raising his 3 sons who are trully geniuses but also enjoy watching stand up comedy and stuff.Charley then goes to an ordinary day of work when he just loses it. And boy does he do crazy and hilarious things. Charley now has a split personality with the sweet Charley and the crazy Hank. He is given pills to prevent his condition from taking effect but when he accompanies a lady to New York, lots of things will happen.The movie has loads of jokes delivered mainly by Hank (Jim Carrey) and his 3 hilarious sons. I found the movie to be really funny and worth a buy. This movie is worth having in everyone's comedy collection. Some really great laughs!",4,Jim Carrey..in an R rated comedy??

The three sons, while quite vulgar, are all humourus.As for the features on the DVD, there are some pretty neat ones.

I foundDumb and Dumberto be absolutely hilarious and, once again, he has made ""Me, Myself and Irene"" a truly enjoyable piece of comedy. Without his fabulous physical performance, this film would be reduced to a string of sight gags and toilet humor which we have all seen before in dozens of other movies.Narrated, in cheesy-fairy-tale style, by Rex Allen Jr., Me, Myself & Irene tells the story of Charlie Baileygates (Jim Carrey), an exceedingly nice Rhode Island State Trooper. He marries the love of his life only to have her run off with an African-American midget and leave their three racially mixed kids for Charlie to raise. Some sixteen years later, the kids have grown up to be geniuses and Charlie grows up with a problem. You see, as various misfortunes have befallen him over the years, he had adopted a grin-and-bear-it attitude that resulted in a lot of bottled-up anger. All that emotion is now releasing itself in the form of advanced delusionary schizophrenia with narcissistic rage, a.k.a. multiple personality disorder.While Charlie is gentle and wary of any confrontation, his other personality Hank is exactly the opposite. He spouts insults all over the place and picks fights with everyone he encounters. Charlie's doctor gives him medication that is supposed to suppress Hank, but Charlie leaves it in his hotel room while escorting a pretty girl named Irene (Renee Zellweger) to upstate New York. He also falls in love with Irene and vows to protect her from crooks and corrupt cops who are after her (among them Chris Cooper, fresh off his American Beauty triumph). But not surprisingly, Hank keeps getting in the way.I know that this movie was not exactly embraced by critics which blows my mind. Seeing that everyone completely adoredThere's Something About Mary (Widescreen Edition)- basically all the same jokes without Jim Carrey to pull them off. This movie is not for everyone, but any astute movie watcher and any true Jim Carrey fan will instantly see the uncompromising energy which he poured into his 2 characters. He is truly a wonder to behold and will go down in history as one of the greatest physical comedic actors of all time. Say what you will about the movie, but it really is a shame that the Academy consistently overlooks Carrey's gifted performances. He has proven that he is a talented actor with the range to perform both serious and comedic roles. Gifted dramatic actors are a dime a dozen in Hollywood - I defy you to find a comedian who can do the things that Carrey does on screen and who can make audiences laugh with just a look.",4,Multi-faceted and funny!,1191715200,"10 7, 2007",2007,2668,"['think', 'Brothers', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'cast', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'more', 'movies', 'foundDumb', 'Dumberto', 'be', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'once', 'again', 'made', 'Me', 'Myself', 'Irene', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'piece', 'comedy', 'fabulous', 'physical', 'performance', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'reduced', 'string', 'sight', 'gags', 'toilet', 'humor', 'have', 'seen', 'dozens', 'other', 'movies.Narrated', 'cheesy-fairy-tale', 'style', 'Rex', 'Allen', 'Jr.', 'Me', 'Myself', 'Irene', 'story', 'Charlie', 'Baileygates', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'exceedingly', 'nice', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'State', 'Trooper', 'love', 'life', 'only', 'have', 'run', 'off', 'African-American', 'midget', 'leave', 'three', 'racially', 'mixed', 'kids', 'Charlie', 'raise', 'sixteen', 'years', 'later', 'kids', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'be', 'geniuses', 'Charlie', 'up', 'problem', 'see', 'various', 'misfortunes', 'have', 'befallen', 'years', 'had', 'adopted', 'grin-and-bear-it', 'attitude', 'resulted', 'lot', 'bottled-up', 'anger', 'emotion', 'now', 'releasing', 'form', 'advanced', 'delusionary', 'schizophrenia', 'narcissistic', 'rage', 'a.k.a', 'multiple', 'personality', 'disorder.While', 'Charlie', 'gentle', 'wary', 'confrontation', 'other', 'personality', 'Hank', 'exactly', 'opposite', 'insults', 'place', 'picks', 'fights', 'everyone', 'Charlie', 'doctor', 'medication', 'supposed', 'suppress', 'Hank', 'Charlie', 'hotel', 'room', 'escorting', 'pretty', 'girl', 'named', 'Irene', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'upstate', 'New', 'York', 'also', 'love', 'Irene', 'vows', 'protect', 'crooks', 'corrupt', 'cops', 'who', 'are', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'fresh', 'off', 'American', 'Beauty', 'triumph', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'Hank', 'getting', 'way.I', 'know', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'exactly', 'embraced', 'critics', 'blows', 'mind', 'Seeing', 'everyone', 'completely', 'Something', 'Mary', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'basically', 'same', 'jokes', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'pull', 'off', 'movie', 'not', 'everyone', 'astute', 'movie', 'watcher', 'true', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'fan', 'will', 'instantly', 'see', 'uncompromising', 'energy', 'poured', '2', 'characters', 'truly', 'wonder', 'behold', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'history', 'one', 'greatest', 'physical', 'comedic', 'actors', 'time', 'Say', 'what', 'will', 'movie', 'really', 'shame', 'Academy', 'consistently', 'Carrey', 'gifted', 'performances', 'proven', 'talented', 'actor', 'range', 'perform', 'serious', 'comedic', 'roles', 'Gifted', 'dramatic', 'actors', 'are', 'dime', 'dozen', 'Hollywood', 'defy', 'find', 'comedian', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'things', 'Carrey', 'screen', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'audiences', 'just', 'look']",N/A

MMI starts off with a whack, when Charlie Baileygates got promoted as a Rhode Island officer, gets married with a girl he loved, then unexpectedly things go haywire when Charlie had a fight with a limo driver and few years later, Layla, Charlie's wife, dumps him with three kids which eventually ends up as foul-mouthed-rocket-scientist-geniuses. The consequence; after years of &quot;just-forget-it-lifes-gonna-be-better-if-you-persevere&quot; attitude which had taken toll on his credibility as an officer, Hank Baileygates invades Charlie's private equilibrium and all heck goes loose. The remarkable thing is Hank would &quot;pop out&quot; whenever Charlie leaves an oppression/provokation unchecked. Irene Waters (played by Renee Zellweger),a witness involved in a corruption scandal, became both Charlie and Hank's object of desire. The cool part; watching both characteristics trying to woo her heart and leaves Irene to figure &quot;who-the-heck-is-who&quot; and vice versa.Jim Carrey in his first hour looks promising, but as another hour comes till the end of the movie, most of his jokes didn't work much, in fact when Charlie and Hank's intolerance of each other goes till a peak, Carrey's actions just falls flat, leaving audiences feeling &quot;oh...haha...&quot; and then there's the end of Carrey's &quot;show&quot;. However, unlike Carrey's previous &quot;one-man-shows&quot; like The Truman Show, The Mask, Ace Ventura 2, the other casts gets the spotlight too. Charlie's three brilliant &quot;Chris-Rock-meets-Albert-Einstein&quot; sons are just mind-numbing, their crude dialogues would corrupt any &quot;goody-two-shoes&quot; on the spot (my fav: GERMAN ON CHOPPER!!), other two characters that seems unsignificant, Irene and &quot;Whitey&quot; gets the flow going and last but not least, one shocking little girl that'll give you a concrete proof NOT TO SHOW R-RATED MOVIES TO CHILDREN!

They use the same combination of physical and dialogue-driven comedy here to produce another very funny, although somewhat less remarkable movie. While Mary created a cultural phenomenon, and paved the way for so many similarly plotted comedies to follow, Me, Myself & Irene is simply one of those followers. Although the formula is still successful, it just doesn't feel as fresh and new as There's Something About Mary, and it feels just a little as if the Farrellys are struggling to come to terms with their own success. Taken in isolation however, Me, Myself & Irene is very good at doing what it sets out to do - make you laugh by depicting the most absurd and often disgusting circumstances imaginable, and then taking a comic twist.The story follows Charlie Baileygates (Jim Carrey), an 18-year veteran of the Rhode Island State Troopers, and a loser whose wife left him for a midget Negro Mensa member, and whose three children are decidedly dark skinned - and rather smart. Charlie doesn't deal well with conflict, and spends most of his time being used and abused by every man and his dog (literally). One day, something snaps inside of Charlie, and we meet Hank (Jim Carrey). Hank loves conflict and will do almost anything to create it. Unfortunately, despite the fact that Charlie can control Hank with drugs, the State Troopers aren't exactly thrilled to have the possibility of Hank working for them. It is at this point that Irene Waters (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) is brought in on an arrest warrant from out of state. This seems to be the perfect job for Charlie - an easy trip to take Irene to up-state New York and hand her over for her warrant. Unfortunately for Irene, her ex-boyfriend and well-to-do hood gets worried that she might know a little too much about the shady dealings he has been involved in. It is up to Charlie and Hank to ensure that Irene survives not only the ex-boyfriend and corrupt cops, but himself, long enough to prove her innocence.This movie is very funny, and closely follows the formula laid out in previous Farrelly brothers movies. The final note to make regarding this movie is on the relationship between Jim Carrey and Ren&eacute;e Zellweger who had quite a public romance following the shooting - and an equally public break up. By all accounts, Ren&eacute;e Zellweger did not allow a romantic relationship to develop while working on the movie, and this seems to have created a good on-screen chemistry between the two. Certainly comparing this movie to Proof Of Life that involved the highly public Russell Crowe and Meg Ryan relationship, Me, Myself & Irene came away without any ill effects.",4,Jim Carrey does it again!,1104278400,"12 29, 2004",2004,2768,"['Me', 'Myself', 'Irene', 'Peter', 'Bobby', 'Farrelly', 'follow-up', 'enormously', 'successful', 'Something', 'Mary', 'use', 'same', 'combination', 'physical', 'dialogue-driven', 'comedy', 'here', 'produce', 'very', 'funny', 'somewhat', 'less', 'remarkable', 'movie', 'Mary', 'created', 'cultural', 'phenomenon', 'paved', 'way', 'so', 'many', 'similarly', 'plotted', 'comedies', 'follow', 'Me', 'Myself', 'Irene', 'simply', 'one', 'followers', 'formula', 'still', 'successful', 'just', ""n't"", 'feel', 'fresh', 'new', 'Something', 'Mary', 'just', 'little', 'Farrellys', 'are', 'struggling', 'come', 'terms', 'own', 'success', 'Taken', 'isolation', 'however', 'Me', 'Myself', 'Irene', 'very', 'good', 'doing', 'what', 'out', 'do', 'make', 'depicting', 'most', 'absurd', 'often', 'disgusting', 'circumstances', 'imaginable', 'then', 'taking', 'comic', 'twist.The', 'story', 'Charlie', 'Baileygates', 'Jim', 'Carrey', '18-year', 'veteran', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'State', 'Troopers', 'loser', 'wife', 'left', 'midget', 'Negro', 'Mensa', 'member', 'three', 'children', 'are', 'decidedly', 'dark', 'skinned', 'rather', 'smart', 'Charlie', ""n't"", 'deal', 'well', 'conflict', 'most', 'time', 'being', 'used', 'abused', 'man', 'dog', 'literally', 'One', 'day', 'something', 'snaps', 'Charlie', 'meet', 'Hank', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Hank', 'conflict', 'will', 'do', 'almost', 'anything', 'create', 'Unfortunately', 'fact', 'Charlie', 'can', 'control', 'Hank', 'drugs', 'State', 'Troopers', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'thrilled', 'have', 'possibility', 'Hank', 'working', 'point', 'Irene', 'Waters', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Zellweger', 'brought', 'arrest', 'warrant', 'state', 'be', 'perfect', 'job', 'Charlie', 'easy', 'trip', 'take', 'Irene', 'up-state', 'New', 'York', 'hand', 'over', 'warrant', 'Unfortunately', 'Irene', 'ex-boyfriend', 'well-to-do', 'hood', 'worried', 'might', 'know', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'shady', 'dealings', 'been', 'involved', 'Charlie', 'Hank', 'ensure', 'Irene', 'not', 'only', 'ex-boyfriend', 'corrupt', 'cops', 'long', 'enough', 'prove', 'innocence.This', 'movie', 'very', 'funny', 'closely', 'formula', 'laid', 'out', 'previous', 'Farrelly', 'brothers', 'movies', 'final', 'note', 'make', 'regarding', 'movie', 'relationship', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Zellweger', 'who', 'had', 'quite', 'public', 'romance', 'following', 'shooting', 'equally', 'public', 'break', 'up', 'accounts', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Zellweger', 'did', 'not', 'allow', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'develop', 'working', 'movie', 'have', 'created', 'good', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'two', 'Certainly', 'comparing', 'movie', 'Proof', 'Life', 'involved', 'highly', 'public', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'relationship', 'Me', 'Myself', 'Irene', 'came', 'away', 'ill', 'effects']",N/A

The Farrelly brothers and Jim Carrey are a match made in heaven. Their style suits Carrey's, as the movie is full of the physical comedy and sight gags which are Carrey's forte.This is a pretty funny, though somewhat sophomoric, movie. It is also pretty filthy, at times, and definitely not for the movie goer of delicate sensibilities. There is something to offend just about everyone, so be prepared.The basic premise of the movie is simple. A Rhode Island state trooper, Charley Baileygates, played by Jim Carrey, marries the prettiest and smartest girl in town. After she gives birth to triplets for whom Charley could not possibly be the father, for  reasons obvious to the viewer, she later leaves him for another man, her soul mate and likely father of the triplets. She leaves Charley with the triplets, whom he raises as his own. The cuckolded Charley goes on to become the town joke and a seriously repressed man.Eighteen years later, he snaps and begins to express his anger through an alternate personality and quintessential bad boy who calls himself Hank. Hank has attitude and plenty of it, and he lets everyone know that he is mad  as hell and is not going to take it anymore. Charley's superiors send him to be evaluated, and he is given medication to control his psychiatric disorder.Enter Irene, played by Rener Zellweger. Charley is asked to escort her to upstate New York where she is ostensibly wanted on a hit and run. Unbeknownst to either of them, she is being hunted down by dirty cops who are looking to silence her, as it is believed that she may have information that could take down her crooked ex boyfriend who is being investigated by the EPA.During their trip, Hank, Charley, and Irene have a host of advantures, which are often hilarious, as Charley and Hank battle over who will become the dominant personality. The low key Zellweger is a good foil for the rubber faced Carrey's physical comedy. As Charley and Irene are pursued by the dirty cops, the now grown triplets, funny and profane, also add another element, as they go to their father's rescue.The DVD has something for everyone, as it has a plethora of bonus features.

522889,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B00003CXE4,Martin Asiner,"[3, 5]","There is a fine line between the humor that results from sight and sound gags and the kind that are so lame that the viewer twitches in startled disbelief.  Jim Carrey has done both types, but with ME, MYSELF, and IRENE, he slips unfunnily into the latter.  Twin directors the brothers Farrely toss Carrey into a situation that needs the right touch to avoid bathos on the road to humor.  Unfortunately, nowhere do they stop Carrey from overmugging.  Carrey has made a career of twisting his rubberface and body, and most often gets away with it.  But here, he is the victim of a split personality, a syndrome that does not lend itself willingly to comedy.  Carrey is Charley, a Rhode Island state trooper whose wife has dumped him for an Afro-American dwarf.  The introductory scene where the dwarf picks a fight with Charley is distinctly unfunny and painful to watch.  Charley has spent a life repressing his feelings with the predictable result that deep within there is an aggressive bear who sounds like Dirty Harry trying to get out.  Charley's alter ego is Hank, who tricks Charley's romantic lead Irene (Renee Zellweger) into sleeping with him by pretending he is Charley.  Now if the Farrely brothers had limited the script into focusing solely on the triangle of Charley, Hank, and Irene, then a more believable comedy might have emerged.  Instead, the Farrelys involve a totally unbelievable subplot that has Irene as some sort of witness to ecological criminal behavior at a golf course.  What I found reprehensible was the frequent use of hiphop obscenties that filled every third scene.  Since chase scenes in comedies really should avoid the real world association of blood and violence, it is incumbent on the cast and director to keep the focus on the comedy that results from the inevitable interaction between interesting characters.  In ME,MYSELF, AND IRENE, the hoped-for comedy falls flat, and talented actors like Jim Carrey and Renee Zellweger are forced to zero in on the toilet humor of a live chicken exploring the recesses of someone's butt.

522890,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CXE4,Matthew Horner,"[0, 1]","I am an admirer of Peter and Robert Farrelly. They directed the underrated Kingpin and the wildly successful There's Something About Mary, one of my favorite comedies of the 1990s. One of my guilty pleasures is Dumb and Dumber, which they wrote. Now comes Me, Myself and Irene, and I find myself taken aback. The bawdy and sometimes infantile jokes are there. The gross-out humor is there. The mad characters are present. The movie is as politically incorrect as one could hope for. All the Farrelly ingredients are in place, except for one. The humor doesn't gel. The movie simply isn't very funny, and being funny is the only reason for a Farrelly brothers picture to exist.Jim Carrey is Charlie, a Rhode Island State trooper. Charlie has been letting people run him over all of his life. No one takes him seriously, either at work or at home. On his wedding day, his wife falls for an African-American chauffeur who is also a dwarf. When she has triplets, Charlie refuses to admit they these boys obviously are not his children. Soon the wife and the midget run away, leaving Charlie to raise the boys. The movie then moves forward a couple of decades. Charlie is still a laughing stock to everyone but the triplets. One day a girl named Irene Renee Zellweger] is arrested for a traffic violation. It turns out the Feds are looking for her because they suspect she has a lot of information on her ex-boss, who is a really nasty fellow. Charlie is assigned to take her back to New York State. Shortly before this, Charlie, having had enough of being pushed around, develops a second personality, a guy named Hank. Hank is everything Charlie isn't. This is one mean and confrontational alter ego. Hank can come out and take Charlie's place at any time, and this causes a lot of trouble. The problem becomes worse when both Charlie and Hank fall for Irene.I don't know enough about screenwriting to tell you exactly what would have saved Me, Myself and Irene. I do know that, as written, there are too many comic setups that don't work. Even the remarkable Jim Carrey was unable to make me laugh more than two or three times, and heaven knows no one tries harder than he does. The main problem seems to be that the Farrellys didn't know when to give up on a running joke. Take the triplets, for example. They grow up to be geniuses, literally capable of being rocket scientists. They have been accepted into Ivy League colleges, yet, not only do they use the 'MF' word constantly, they are the only characters in the movie to do so. If they were minor characters seen only briefly, this might have been humorous. As it is, they are seen throughout the movie, and the joke becomes quickly tiresome. Later, we meet an albino waiter who is present though the rest of the picture. He, too, is someone you wish would go away. If you look at earlier Farrelly movies, as well as those of comic masters like Mel Brooks and the Zucker brothers, you will note that they work because they constantly move on to the next joke. What few running jokes that are utilized are used sparingly and to good effect.Me, Myself and Irene is merely a pothole in the careers of Carrey and the Farrellys. They are too smart not to learn from their mistakes, and I look forward to their next efforts. Knowing this doesn't make this movie any less painful to watch.",2,Farrelly Brothers flounder in Carrey comedy,1016323200,"03 17, 2002",2002,3337,"['am', 'admirer', 'Peter', 'Robert', 'Farrelly', 'directed', 'underrated', 'Kingpin', 'wildly', 'successful', 'Something', 'Mary', 'one', 'favorite', 'comedies', '1990s', 'One', 'guilty', 'pleasures', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'wrote', 'Now', 'Me', 'Myself', 'Irene', 'find', 'taken', 'aback', 'bawdy', 'sometimes', 'infantile', 'jokes', 'are', 'there', 'gross-out', 'humor', 'there', 'mad', 'characters', 'are', 'present', 'movie', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'one', 'could', 'hope', 'Farrelly', 'ingredients', 'are', 'place', 'one', 'humor', ""n't"", 'gel', 'movie', 'simply', ""n't"", 'very', 'funny', 'being', 'funny', 'only', 'reason', 'Farrelly', 'brothers', 'picture', 'exist.Jim', 'Carrey', 'Charlie', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'State', 'trooper', 'Charlie', 'been', 'letting', 'people', 'run', 'life', 'one', 'seriously', 'either', 'work', 'home', 'wedding', 'day', 'wife', 'African-American', 'chauffeur', 'who', 'also', 'dwarf', 'When', 'triplets', 'Charlie', 'admit', 'boys', 'obviously', 'are', 'not', 'children', 'wife', 'midget', 'run', 'away', 'leaving', 'Charlie', 'raise', 'boys', 'movie', 'then', 'forward', 'couple', 'decades', 'Charlie', 'still', 'laughing', 'stock', 'everyone', 'triplets', 'One', 'day', 'girl', 'named', 'Irene', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', ']', 'arrested', 'traffic', 'violation', 'out', 'Feds', 'are', 'looking', 'suspect', 'lot', 'information', 'ex-boss', 'who', 'really', 'nasty', 'fellow', 'Charlie', 'assigned', 'take', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'State', 'Shortly', 'Charlie', 'having', 'had', 'enough', 'being', 'pushed', 'second', 'personality', 'guy', 'named', 'Hank', 'Hank', 'everything', 'Charlie', ""n't"", 'one', 'mean', 'confrontational', 'alter', 'ego', 'Hank', 'can', 'come', 'out', 'take', 'Charlie', 'place', 'time', 'lot', 'trouble', 'problem', 'worse', 'when', 'Charlie', 'Hank', 'fall', 'Irene.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'enough', 'screenwriting', 'tell', 'exactly', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'saved', 'Me', 'Myself', 'Irene', 'do', 'know', 'written', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'comic', 'setups', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'Even', 'remarkable', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'was', 'unable', 'make', 'more', 'two', 'three', 'times', 'heaven', 'one', 'harder', 'main', 'problem', 'be', 'Farrellys', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'give', 'up', 'running', 'joke', 'Take', 'triplets', 'example', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'geniuses', 'literally', 'capable', 'being', 'rocket', 'scientists', 'have', 'been', 'accepted', 'Ivy', 'League', 'colleges', 'yet', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'use', ""'MF"", 'word', 'constantly', 'are', 'only', 'characters', 'movie', 'do', 'so', 'were', 'minor', 'characters', 'seen', 'only', 'briefly', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'humorous', 'are', 'seen', 'movie', 'joke', 'quickly', 'tiresome', 'Later', 'meet', 'albino', 'waiter', 'who', 'present', 'rest', 'picture', 'too', 'someone', 'wish', 'would', 'go', 'away', 'look', 'earlier', 'Farrelly', 'movies', 'as', 'well', 'comic', 'masters', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'Zucker', 'brothers', 'will', 'note', 'work', 'constantly', 'move', 'next', 'joke', 'What', 'few', 'running', 'jokes', 'are', 'utilized', 'are', 'used', 'sparingly', 'good', 'effect.Me', 'Myself', 'Irene', 'merely', 'pothole', 'careers', 'Carrey', 'Farrellys', 'are', 'too', 'smart', 'not', 'learn', 'mistakes', 'look', 'forward', 'next', 'efforts', 'Knowing', ""n't"", 'make', 'movie', 'less', 'painful', 'watch']",N/A

Charlie Bailygates (Jim Carrey, of course) is the kind of guy that you can just walk all over. He's been a painfully docile and non-confrontational police officer ever since his wife left him for a vertically challanged smart-elic and left him the responsibility of raising little Jamaal, Lee Harvey, and Shonte jr.But one day, all that changes. When Charlie is pushed too far, Hank, the personification of all of Charlie's repressed anger, erupts and the battle for the Bailygates body is on. It turns even more so when Irene (Renee Zellwegger) is on the run from her old boss, whose out to kill her. Charlie tries to protect her, but Hank gets in the way alot, and the two personalities compete for Irene's affections.IRENE is the kind of movie that doesn't completly succeed or fail in it's attempts to cause laughter. Hank is the ironic character. He seems to have been concoted as comic relief for a comedy. I don't think this is a bad thing at all, I liked the movie. Hank may actually be the most interesting character in the movie, and the dirty tricks he pulls to get cozy with Charlie's Angel result in Charlie eventually getting tazered, thrown off a hill, and kicked in the nuts. Hank is the first alternate personality I've seen with road rage.The funniest scene, by far, has got to be when Hank and Charlie get in to a fist-fight, with the end result being Jim Carrey smacking himself around. Then there's the scene where Hank first appears, and unleashes the proper comuppance on the people who use Charlie for a doormat, though the woman with the baby didn't desreve what she got. In all, I found it to be pretty funny.

The only reason I was watching this is because I'm a fan of Jim Carrey. The beginning was a disappointment, but the last hour certainly made up for it! It's full of typical Farrelly brothers lowbrow humour, and some of the scenes are unnecessary and make you cringe.Jim Carrey did great in this film, although the moustache near the beginning was a big mistake, and don't get me started on the Forrest Gump hairstyle!Renee Zellweger plays her usual role, and looking at this film, it's a wonder how she was ever considered for the Bridget Jones role, she's ultra skinny!  Good job there's not a crack in the floorboards, or she would go straight through!The one thing about the Farrelly brothers films is that they always have very memorable scenes. There's Something About Mary - the ""hairgel"" scene. Kingpin - I can't remember what exactly was going on, but where Woody Harrelson gets his nipple out and squirts his opponent with milk! THE scene for Me, Myself &amp; Irene has to be the breastfeeding scene. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw exactly what Jim was doing, although it is kinda predictable.The narrator did annoy me, he didn't really have any connection to the film, and it would have been better to have one of the main characters narrating it.There are a few good moments in this film, but they're few &amp; far between to begin with. The last hour is definitely the best for Jim Carrey humour and slapstick. It's amazing what he manages to do in that last hour - including beating himself up!Who do I prefer? Can't I have both?!

I guess I was waiting for a good price. Anyway, this should've been another huge hit for Jim Carrey, who's split personality performance is a marvel to behold. According to the audio commentary by the Farrelly Brothers, Jim pretty much ad-libbed the entire role of Hank, his 2nd personality that arises due to the fact that Charlie, his original personality, has withdrawn from himself and cannot deal with his anger and pain. There is a story and plot to this film.  I can't believe people can't acknowledge it. Charlie is a Road Island State Trooper who is chosen to escort Irene, (played so warmly by Rene Zellweger) who's arrested on a charge, and hand her over to the Feds. Unfortunately things don't go that smoothly for the two on their little road trip. The shooting of the cow scene is hilarious. I'm not one for abusing animals, but in the Farrelly Brothers defense, Charlie thought the cow was dying and decided to do the humane thing, which was put it out of its misery. That's why it doesn't come off as cruel or upsetting. Instead it becomes a laugh riot!Jim Carrey should be commended for his performance in this film. Yes, you will notice snipit personalities from other Carrey faves like Liar Liar, Dumb & Dumber & The Cable Guy, which is fine by me. An actor can only do so many roles before he starts re-cycling them again, only with Carrey there's a nice little twist always involved. I mean here he's playing two roles (like he did in the Mask), but this time he's interacting with both of them. He's fighting with them, verbally as well as physically  He just makes it look so easy, it's astonishing. Some favorite ""Hank"" moments include the initial transformation into the alter-ego at the checkout counter when a woman asks if she can go ahead of Charlie who then calls her kids over with a couple of filled carts. Carrey, as Hank, picks up some Vagi-Clean cream from her cart and asks for a price check, to end all price checks. He then proceeds to go and dunk a little girl who didn't listen to him earlier, crashes a man's car into a building because he hadn't moved his vehicle from an hour only parking lot in 3 days. There's so many more, but it'd take me forever to name them.Rene Zellweger & Jim Carrey really have great chemistry in the movie. Is it any wonder they became a couple? Too bad it didn't last, but that's Hollywood life for ya!This DVD Special Edition is really quite impressive. First of all, hats off to 20th Century Fox! Out of all the studios, they're the one's who have really advanced in their DVD presentations. I remember when it was just a lousy trailer as the only extra and you still payed full price. This DVD has a great deleted scenes feature that enables you to actually put them back into the regular film and watch them as they were originally inserted. A fun Foo Fighters music video (Breakout) with lead singer, Dave Grohl, playing a sort of copy of the Charlie/Hank character (he even takes his date to see ""Me, Myself & Irene"" at a drive in) is a lot of fun & the song is great too! Some Productions Vignettes that can also be watched during the film make for a informative viewing. And of course, no Special Edition DVD would be without an audio commentary with the director(s). It is a little disappointing, however, since all Bobby & Peter Farrelly  mostly talk about is the music they used and picking out all of their family and friends in the movie, which even they admit is unnecassary since they are all shown during the end credits. I'd say their ""There's Something About Mary"" commentary was better, but here, occasionally, they do give some intersting info, such as how Jim was very afraid to have that Spider crawling on him & that when Irene drop kicks Hank down a hill, that's really Jim doing the stunt (with a mattress at the bottom, which is how he pops back into frame). Definately worth a viewing.Add a nice Featurette and some great Theatrical Trailers and you've got a very impressive Special Edition DVD. If you passed on this movie before, give it a try now. It will definately give your DVD player a hearty workout.",4,A Great Special Edition DVD!

Playing a man suffering from a split personality - one nice, the other psychotic - Carrey is free to pull out all the stops in terms of mugging, pratfalls and plain old-fashioned silliness.  No comic actor working in movies today is more adept than Carrey is at the instant transitioning between seeming normalcy and uncontrolled mania.  Yet, for all his hard work here, the Farrellys, who seem to have plateau-ed in this work, have left Carrey pretty much stranded in the script department this time out.  Perhaps the shtick is simply starting to get old and, as a result, for all the film's humorous, inventive moments, ""Me, Myself &amp; Irene"" feels strangely stale.  Even Carrey seems at times to be just going through the motions - picking up a fat paycheck doing what he's done numerous times before while waiting for that next big ""legitimate"" project like ""The Truman Show"" to come along.Don't get me wrong.  No movie written and directed by the Farrellys and starring Carrey and Renee Zellweger can fail to elicit its fair share of laughs.  Some of the concepts are simply so outrageous that they can't help but be funny.  But that is a far cry from a fully integrated work of comic intelligence - a result these gifted filmmakers, working together, have been able to achieve several times in the past (to great box office success, I might add).  Regrettably, for all its moments of inspired zaniness and silliness, ""Me, Myself &amp; Irene"" finds both Carrey and the Farrelly Brothers marking time and resting on their laurels.

The Farrellys always had, until now, a good idea of what's funny, and if they can be gross and funny at the same time, well, that's even better.  But I didn't find anything funny about the prolonged shot of the defecating dog nor the placement of the chicken where the sun don't shine.  I think I only laughed aloud twice -- at the bit with the cow and at the sloppy wet kisses between the black dwarf chauffeur and Charlie's ex-wife.  There were other good moments but those damn promo trailers had already spoiled them.  I think the involvement of scowling corrupt cops in the plot was also a misstep.  Not only are the scenes involving the paper cut-out criminals incredibly dull, but just the presence of a menace in a Farrelly brothers movie is incongruously jarring, and as a result, I couldn't sense any of the sweetness that was at the core of their previous films.  Moreover, the Farrellys felt obligated to wrap up all the loose ends begotten by their ill-conceived plot with a stupid action sequence replete with an albino deus ex machina.  As for Jim Carrey, he is fun to watch, as always, especially in those scenes in which Hank and Charlie confront one another, which reminded me of the hilarious bathroom sequence in 'Liar Liar'.  But alas, he was unable to save the film.  I should also note that hockey fans may want to stay for the closing credits.

Dumb and Dumber, Kingpin, and Something About Mary.Those were classics.  This is just another comedy.It revolves around Carrey's character Charlie who puts up with crap from people all his life, and finally just snaps one day, and creates an alter-ego, Hank.  Hank is a nasty sort, who breast-feeds on a mother who is nursing her baby, and other Farrleyesque humor.  The plot has to do with Irene who is being framed for a crime she did not commit and Charlie/Hank trying to save her.  But honestly the plot is beside the point, beause you just want to see this movie to see Jim Carrey be funny.  For the most part he delivers, but not as well as in Dumb and Dumber.  If you want to see him do a good job at really acting check out Man on the Moon.  The story of Andy Kaufman.  He is amazing in that part.I don't know why I didn't think this was as funny as the other three I mentioned.  If I saw it again I might enjoy it more.

I think he was smart in doing some serious films.  He was good in them, but it made people want to see him funny again.THE BADI just think it could have been funnier.THE BOTTOM LINEI think my expectations were too high.

I'm a big fan of Carrey and I'm also a nice person who's been stepped on one too many times in my life. So when Charlie (Carrey) finally snaps in the grocery store, I feel like I can relate and only wish I had the nerve to act like his alter-ego, Hank, who soon starts taking over. Much like me, Charlie wasn't always this way. He got married and his wife wound up having an affair with the black midget limo driver from their wedding day. She has triplets and although it's quite obvious Charlie's not the father, he embraces them anyway. And then, she leaves him and the boys.And that's when Charlie starts chipping away. He buries all of his anger and sadness inside until lo and behold, he cannot take it anymore. His first outburst is by far my favorite. His fellow troopers on the Rhode Island force are worried about him and he now has to take pills that keep Hank from coming out. His boss gives him time off and asks him to drop off a woman named Irene in upstate New York. The EPA wants to talk to her about her involvement with a golf course scam, but Irene doesn't know anything about it...her ex does and before she can figure it out, he's got everyone coming for her. When his guys kill the agents Charlie has left her with, Irene runs to get Charlie and the 2 must leave immediately. Of course, as they hit the road, Charlie forgets to bring his pills and soon, Irene gets to meet Hank.But will the ""3"" of them (Charlie, Hank & Irene) survive on the lam? Ah, it's certainly not Carrey's best film, but if you're a fan, you'll certainly laugh out loud and have a wonderful time. He really does a great job.

Seriously, if you are going to put out a library title, make darned sure that you offer up a reason to actually spend the money to upgrade and move to Blu instead of just keeping the DVD release and living with it.I love this movie.  It is wicked, deranged, twisted, warped, and all of the other similar words you could pull from a Roget's thesaurus that mean the same basic thing.  It is also insanely funny.  Jim Carrey plays Charlie Baileygates, a member of the finest police force known to man.  A man who is just too darned nice, and who has let the world treat him as a doormat for far too long.  Eventually all of the abuse that Charlie has taken overwhelms him and an split personality arises within Charlie that releases 'Hank' upon the world.  Hank is Charlie's mean and wicked alter ego, and thanks to an on screen battle between the two personalities and appearances by Hank at the absolute worst time for Charlie we get to see a riotously funny movie.Ren&eacute;e Zellweger also stars and adds to the fun in this movie as an individual that Charlie must safely transport on a road trip.  While transporting her, Charlie and Hank fight the internal struggle within Charlie to bring his personalities together so he doesn't wind up causing himself or others harm, as well as perhaps losing his dream job working as a Rhode Island state trooper.The DVD version of the movie is a classic for me.  It offers several nice extras, some of which were inexplicably left out of this Blu-ray release.  I really wish the studio hadn't gone that route as I'd love to recommend this title for purchase, but rewarding such tactics just seems completely wrong to me.  The bare minimum would be to keep everything that was on the DVD, and really customers should expect to get *more* for their money when being asked to 'double dip' on buying these library titles.  Getting less is not to be rewarded, so I'd have to say rent this title or get the much less expensive DVD release instead of the Blu-ray here.

With the exception of ""The Grinch,"" his last few movies including ""Man on the Moon,"" and ""The Majestic"" have flopped considerably.  ""Me, Myself, & Irene"" didn't exactly bomb at the box office, but it's among Carrey's very worst films.  Carrey plays a cop who is dumped by his girlfriend; the breakup traumatizes him so badly, that he develops a split personality called ""Hank.""  Meanwhile, he fathers 3 thuggish African American men who are incredibly bright even though they all have mouths of drunken sailors.

522948,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00003CXE4,Wuchak,"[1, 1]","Released in 2000, ""Me, Myself & Irene"" is a Jim Carrey comedy about a Rhode Island motorcycle cop (Carrey) who has a mental breakdown after allowing people to walk all over him for three decades. He develops a split personality consisting of Charlie, the nice guy, and Hank, the take-no-crap dude. After going on meds, he's given the assignment of escorting Irene (Renee Zellwegger) from Rhode Island to upstate New York. The two become fugitives as Charlie/Hank falls for Irene. Meanwhile Charlie's three black sons get involved in finding him.The film works because Carrey gives the schizophrenic role all his heart and the Farrelly brothers (the directors/writers) go to extremes with the gags, as usual. There's quite a bit of crudeness and cussing, but I was able to overlook it and laugh. Most of the cussing comes from Charlie's three black sons who are veritable geniuses, but maintain their homey lingo. It's not meant to be offensive, but funny; you either get it or you don't.The film also works because we can all relate to the struggle within between wanting to get along with people and not wanting to be taken advantage of. It's somehow enjoyable to see Charlie morph into Hank with his take-no-sheet attitude. I also like the way the film ties up the schizophrenia issue. The answer is to maintain a balance between being overly nicey-wicey and overly forthright & intolerable. The ""middle road"" is the key.This was the first film I saw Renee in and she really shines here -- petite, sassy, smart and beautiful. I also like the funny three black sons and the addition of the dubious albino dude.FINAL WORD: ""Me, Myself and Irene"" loses points for being unnecessarily crude, but -- if you can overlook that or laugh with it -- it is entertaining and funny. It places well with Carrey's funniest movies, although the first Ace Ventura film, ""The Mask"" and ""Liar, Liar"" are better.The film runs 116 minutes and was shot in Rhode Island and Vermont.GRADE: B+",4,"Unnecessarily crude, but funny and entertaining",1378771200,"09 10, 2013",2013,1970,"['Released', '2000', 'Me', 'Myself', 'Irene', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'comedy', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'motorcycle', 'cop', 'Carrey', 'who', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'allowing', 'people', 'walk', 'three', 'decades', 'split', 'personality', 'consisting', 'Charlie', 'nice', 'guy', 'Hank', 'take-no-crap', 'dude', 'going', 'meds', 'given', 'assignment', 'escorting', 'Irene', 'Renee', 'Zellwegger', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'upstate', 'New', 'York', 'two', 'become', 'fugitives', 'Charlie/Hank', 'Irene', 'Meanwhile', 'Charlie', 'three', 'black', 'sons', 'get', 'involved', 'finding', 'him.The', 'film', 'works', 'Carrey', 'schizophrenic', 'role', 'heart', 'Farrelly', 'brothers', 'directors/writers', 'go', 'extremes', 'gags', 'usual', 'quite', 'bit', 'crudeness', 'cussing', 'was', 'able', 'overlook', 'laugh', 'Most', 'cussing', 'Charlie', 'three', 'black', 'sons', 'who', 'are', 'veritable', 'geniuses', 'maintain', 'homey', 'lingo', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'offensive', 'funny', 'either', 'get', ""don't.The"", 'film', 'also', 'can', 'relate', 'struggle', 'wanting', 'get', 'people', 'not', 'wanting', 'be', 'taken', 'advantage', 'somehow', 'enjoyable', 'see', 'Charlie', 'morph', 'Hank', 'take-no-sheet', 'attitude', 'also', 'way', 'film', 'up', 'schizophrenia', 'issue', 'answer', 'maintain', 'balance', 'being', 'overly', 'nicey-wicey', 'overly', 'forthright', 'intolerable', 'middle', 'road', 'key.This', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'saw', 'Renee', 'really', 'here', 'petite', 'sassy', 'smart', 'beautiful', 'also', 'funny', 'three', 'black', 'sons', 'addition', 'dubious', 'albino', 'dude.FINAL', 'WORD', 'Me', 'Myself', 'Irene', 'points', 'being', 'unnecessarily', 'crude', 'can', 'overlook', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'well', 'Carrey', 'funniest', 'movies', 'first', 'Ace', 'Ventura', 'film', 'Mask', 'Liar', 'Liar', 'are', 'better.The', 'film', '116', 'minutes', 'was', 'shot', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'Vermont.GRADE', 'B+']",N/A

Yes, critics did have a hayday with this one. But did you honestly believe that well known critics such as Roger Ebert (example)would truely give their stamp of approval 2 Farrelly Bros. films in a row? Mr. Ebert gave a 2 star review on Dumb &amp; Dumber, the movie that started it all and in my opinion is still funnier than There's Something About Mary. Don't let critics influence you that strongly, for 'Irene' is the same taste in humor as 'Mary'. Gross out comedy has no doubt hit the big time, but the funny thing is this. You went to 'Dumb'and liked what you saw. You heard 'Kingpin' was from the creators of 'Dumb', returned to the theaters with the same result...you liked what you saw. You had to have liked both, everyone (yes everyone...you!) went nuts for 'Mary'. 'Mary' is only considered #1 out of the 4 Farrelly movies because critics saw something in it. The word got around, spread like wildfire. But comparing all four is pointless. It's the gross out humor you went for. That and JIM CARREY of course. And hey, it still did the trick for me. Is the plot weak? A little, but how many comedies can you name that have very strong plots? Are the jokes rehashed garbage? Not at all. This stuff is pretty fresh, not the run of the mill. Is the movie offensive? OH YEAH, the language is quite poor. But probably only a 1/4 as bad as the South Park movie's. The main character has a split personality disorder and must had been right on the nose for many people who suffer from this atrocity actually tried having the flim banned. Let's face the facts...shocking sells. Is the acting good? UH...YEAH. It's JIM CARREY for crying out loud, and he's back to basics. As for the rest of the cast, maybe not that great. But with JIM there, it isn't that noticable. I give this comedy 3 stars (out of 4)&amp; it's DVD a solid 4 stars (out of 5). With a full feature commentary by the Farrellys, a music video (&quot;BREAKOUT!&quot;), atleast 15 hilarious deleted scenes, and plenty more, I strongly recommend this one for the whole gross out fanatic community. First of all, rent it to make YOUR decision solid. Secondly, if you have the other 3 Farrelly movies or a JIM CARREY collection, what are you reading this for?
