They were and still are a very talented band and I never get tired of listening to their many hit songs. The only complaint that I have is I wish they were still doing more music videos, but I'll take what's out there. I'm a musician in a country band and I know firsthand what a &#34;blast&#34; it is to get into a &#34;music groove&#34; with your fellow musicians. You can see the bond among the girls in the band when they're performing and the sound they put out confirms it. I hope everyone has a &#34;blast&#34; with this DVD as I have.

I mainly got this DVD to watch Susanna Hoffs as she's always great to look at, but of 18 songs the Bangles performed, I only liked half the selections. I wished they had performed ""Be With You"" along with the classics they performed. And from the ""Doll Revolution"" selections I wished ""Tear Off Your Own Head"" and ""Something That You Said"" were played. Now to the hits that they did perform that I like, most weren't perform in its original way. I don't mind if a song or two gets a revamped, but not most of them. Maybe it was just me, but it sure didn't sound like they originally were. Maybe because it's performed live, or I need a few more watching to get used to. Those were my only two gripes, if it weren't for that, this would have been a 5 star rating for me.

Whether you were there or not, the songs of the Bangles have filtered down now to ""classic radio"" and have become part of the mainstream. But this concert shows these four musicians/singers to be one great band with all the requisite hooks, harmony, personality, looks and charm to keep most of their material from being time-warped and restricted only to oldies shows.  The songs are still strong today (even with the exception of the overly cute ""Walk like an Egyptian"") and the new material is easily equal. With loyal keyboardist Harpo, the Bangles state their case that they weren't a formula band, not some clever marketing idea, but a real life rock and roll band. This is one enjoyable show - not perfect - just a great deal of fun, with great music from four musicians who enjoy what they do and an obviously appreciative audience.",5,Return well worth the wait,1193875200,"11 1, 2007",2007,988,"['Arguably', '80', 'were', 'not', 'greatest', 'period', 'good', 'music', 'were', 'outstanding', 'songs', 'great', 'bands', 'wonderful', 'periods', 'were', 'there', 'not', 'songs', 'Bangles', 'have', 'filtered', 'down', 'now', 'classic', 'radio', 'have', 'become', 'part', 'mainstream', 'concert', 'four', 'musicians/singers', 'be', 'one', 'great', 'band', 'requisite', 'hooks', 'harmony', 'personality', 'charm', 'keep', 'most', 'material', 'being', 'time-warped', 'restricted', 'only', 'oldies', 'shows', 'songs', 'are', 'still', 'strong', 'today', 'even', 'exception', 'overly', 'cute', 'Walk', 'Egyptian', 'new', 'material', 'easily', 'equal', 'loyal', 'keyboardist', 'Harpo', 'Bangles', 'state', 'case', 'were', ""n't"", 'formula', 'band', 'not', 'clever', 'marketing', 'idea', 'real', 'life', 'rock', 'roll', 'band', 'one', 'enjoyable', 'show', 'not', 'perfect', 'just', 'great', 'deal', 'fun', 'great', 'music', 'four', 'musicians', 'who', 'enjoy', 'what', 'do', 'obviously', 'appreciative', 'audience']",The Bangles: Return to Bangleonia - Live in Concert

1087491,AATS9Q7VJ4PFI,B000SQL4ZG,Kevin R. Austra,"[20, 20]","I have been waiting for a live Bangles concert since MTV's professionally produced broadcast of the band's December 1986 Pittsburgh performance. Even though I subsequently recorded a VHS copy of the rebroadcast live performance I was hopeful and official version would some day become available.  Alas, it has not.  Not yet, anyway.  The next best thing is RETURN TO BANGLEONIA.The 2000 performance was filmed at the famous House of Blues and is captured from various roving cameras.  The digital recording is of superb quality.  RETURN TO BANGLEONIA is truly a professional product.  I hope that a CD version of the performance eventually becomes available.  More importantly it was great to see the Bangles together again.I was initially wary of buying this DVD.  Some of the reviews gave rise to the belief that this was not a whole uninterrupted concert.  The cartoony-looking DVD cover only served to perpetuate my quandry.  When I finally made the purchase I was happy I did so.  The DVD is a complete performance, and then some.The Bangles went their separate ways when the group was just about at their peak.  Following the very successful albums/CDs DIFFERENT LIGHT and EVERYTHING, the group stalled.  The greatest hits CD, very often a warning sign, and its VHS companion hit store shelves in 1990.  The Bangles went their separate ways.  It was a decade before they fully reunited for an AUSTIN POWERS soundtrack and subsequently released DOLL REVOLUTION. Unfortunately the decade break took its toll.  Marriages, families, and other important distractions ensured that the Bangles would enter the public eye at infrequent intervals.Even in RETURN TO BANGLEONIA we are treated to some of the wear and tear on the band.  Unlike the 1980s' Pittsburgh concernt, where the gals bubbled with energy and enthusiasm, Susanna Hoffs appears to be the only member of the band truly enjoying the performance. Even Michael Steele seems more distant. Maybe this was a precursor to her hopefully not permanent departure from the band.  At the conclusion of the House of Blues concert you see her strut off stage while Hoffs and sisters Peterson group hug-bow.  It is too bad that Steele does not appear in any of the interview segments in the special features.In watching and listening to the BANGLEONIA DVD I noted that many of the numbers were performed in a more folksy manner.  Accoustic guitars are more evident in this concert.  There is no great effort to try and replicate the sound of the original recordings.  In some ways this was a disappointment and in others it was refreshing.  In any event, the price is right and DVD is high quality.",4,Better than Expected,1213315200,"06 13, 2008",2008,2647,"['have', 'been', 'waiting', 'live', 'Bangles', 'concert', 'MTV', 'professionally', 'produced', 'broadcast', 'band', 'December', '1986', 'Pittsburgh', 'performance', 'Even', 'subsequently', 'recorded', 'VHS', 'copy', 'rebroadcast', 'live', 'performance', 'was', 'hopeful', 'official', 'version', 'would', 'day', 'become', 'available', 'Alas', 'not', 'Not', 'yet', 'anyway', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'RETURN', 'TO', 'BANGLEONIA.The', '2000', 'performance', 'was', 'filmed', 'famous', 'House', 'Blues', 'captured', 'various', 'roving', 'cameras', 'digital', 'recording', 'superb', 'quality', 'RETURN', 'TO', 'BANGLEONIA', 'truly', 'professional', 'product', 'hope', 'CD', 'version', 'performance', 'eventually', 'available', 'More', 'importantly', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'Bangles', 'together', 'again.I', 'was', 'initially', 'wary', 'buying', 'DVD', 'reviews', 'gave', 'rise', 'belief', 'was', 'not', 'whole', 'uninterrupted', 'concert', 'cartoony-looking', 'DVD', 'cover', 'only', 'served', 'perpetuate', 'quandry', 'When', 'finally', 'made', 'purchase', 'was', 'happy', 'did', 'so', 'DVD', 'complete', 'performance', 'then', 'some.The', 'Bangles', 'went', 'separate', 'ways', 'when', 'group', 'was', 'just', 'about', 'peak', 'Following', 'very', 'successful', 'albums/CDs', 'DIFFERENT', 'LIGHT', 'EVERYTHING', 'group', 'stalled', 'greatest', 'hits', 'CD', 'very', 'often', 'warning', 'sign', 'VHS', 'companion', 'hit', 'store', 'shelves', '1990', 'Bangles', 'went', 'separate', 'ways', 'was', 'decade', 'fully', 'reunited', 'AUSTIN', 'POWERS', 'soundtrack', 'subsequently', 'released', 'DOLL', 'REVOLUTION', 'Unfortunately', 'decade', 'break', 'took', 'toll', 'Marriages', 'families', 'other', 'important', 'distractions', 'ensured', 'Bangles', 'would', 'enter', 'public', 'eye', 'infrequent', 'intervals.Even', 'RETURN', 'TO', 'BANGLEONIA', 'are', 'treated', 'wear', 'tear', 'band', '1980s', 'Pittsburgh', 'concernt', 'where', 'gals', 'bubbled', 'energy', 'enthusiasm', 'Susanna', 'Hoffs', 'be', 'only', 'member', 'band', 'truly', 'enjoying', 'performance', 'Even', 'Michael', 'Steele', 'more', 'distant', 'Maybe', 'was', 'precursor', 'hopefully', 'not', 'permanent', 'departure', 'band', 'conclusion', 'House', 'Blues', 'concert', 'see', 'strut', 'off', 'stage', 'Hoffs', 'sisters', 'Peterson', 'group', 'hug-bow', 'too', 'bad', 'Steele', 'not', 'appear', 'interview', 'segments', 'special', 'features.In', 'watching', 'listening', 'BANGLEONIA', 'DVD', 'noted', 'many', 'numbers', 'were', 'performed', 'more', 'folksy', 'manner', 'Accoustic', 'guitars', 'are', 'more', 'evident', 'concert', 'great', 'effort', 'try', 'replicate', 'sound', 'original', 'recordings', 'ways', 'was', 'disappointment', 'others', 'was', 'refreshing', 'event', 'price', 'right', 'DVD', 'high', 'quality']",The Bangles: Return to Bangleonia - Live in Concert

It's great to see the Bangles back together again and know that they are still making music.  I hope to see them live someday.I understand some of the criticisms of this DVD, like perhaps the sound production, but the fact remains that you get a live concert, two bonus tracks -- one of their great hits plus my personal favorite song off of ""Doll Revolution"" -- and a commentary track.  So, this can be watched and enjoyed at least twice.  Oh yeah, there's some documentary footage too, and I found it worth watching since I have very little ""behind the scenes"" knowledge of Bangles history or folklore.The commentary track is a lot of fun, and it's quite interesting and informative to hear the band members tell stories about the songs as they are played.

Unless she's singing lead she's almost absent, and she's parked so far out in right field that wide-angle shots have trouble fitting all four in the frame.

Better yet, a concert at the House Of Blues in LA that I was actually at and it's just as great as I remembered it!!  The show is from 2000, so it's before Michael left and we get the original line up.  In addition to most of their classic album tracks and singles, we get a live version of their reunion song ""Get The Girl"" and preview of a half dozen or so from their reunion album (which would be released a couple of years after this show) that would be called ""Doll Revolution"".  Great new songs like ""Ride The Ride"" mix seamlessly in with their standards and the girls look and sound great.

As a bonus, for me, I'm in about 40 or 50 different shots of the audience, smiling and bobbing my head in time to the hooks!

The lyrics are drwoned out in the 5.1 mix, and the 2.0 doesn't have all that much sepration. My other complaint with this DVD is that it is in non-anamorphic widescreen, even though it was shot in HD. This should have been released in anamorhpic widescreen, which would have helped it look much better on my HDTV. Instead, I am forced to watch with either bars on all 4 sides, or zoom in for a much grainier, pixelated image.",3,"Good, but could have been better",1215388800,"07 7, 2008",2008,531,"['performance', 'band', 'was', 'good', 'sound', 'mix', 'patricularly', '5.1', 'surround', 'seem', 'bit', 'off', 'lyrics', 'are', 'drwoned', 'out', '5.1', 'mix', '2.0', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'sepration', 'other', 'complaint', 'DVD', 'non-anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'even', 'was', 'shot', 'HD', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'anamorhpic', 'widescreen', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'look', 'much', 'better', 'HDTV', 'Instead', 'am', 'forced', 'watch', 'bars', '4', 'sides', 'zoom', 'much', 'grainier', 'pixelated', 'image']",The Bangles: Return to Bangleonia - Live in Concert
1087501,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000SQL4ZG,trebe,"[6, 6]","Return to Bangleonia is simply a must have for fans of The Bangles.  The music spans the career of the band from the mid 80's to their latest recording, Doll Revolution (2003).  It features some of their best songs, and captures the magic of the group live, showcasing their musicianship, and the lead and harmony vocals that are a signature part of their sound.  And since Michael Steele has left the group, this performance may be one of the last remembrances featuring the original members.One of the pioneering all female bands in rock, The Bangles found commercial success in the 80's with their 60's influenced brand of melodic pop rock.  After producing the albums All Over the Place (1984), Different Light (1986), and Everything (1988), the group disbanded for a time, but reformed in 1999 to record for an Austin Powers film, and then eventually their first album in fifteen years, Doll Revolution in 2003.  This concert was shot in 2000 on their home turf, at the House of Blues in Hollywood.  The band has their musical stuff solidly together, the venue is great, and the ladies look fantastic while rocking out.  Joining them on keyboards is Greg Hilfman.The vocals are an ultra-critical element, in this band where all four members sing lead.  When you put these voices together, you get something that can be really special , greater than the sum of the parts.  The intimate nature of the Hard Rock makes it an ideal venue for The Bangles, where their vocals and clean and clear guitar sounds, can really be heard.  On a small stage, with the audience literally a few feet away, the tight camera angles make you feel like you are right up at front of the stage, grooving with the rest of the enthralled audience.  It is a warm and happy place.  As the song goes `There's no place better than here right now'.There aren't an excessive number of cameras shooting, but there are enough for good coverage and variety, and the editing is mostly well done.  The sound mix is marvelous, as you can hear the individual voices and the instruments quite distinctly.  If the bass was cranked up a bit more, it would be perfect.The set list includes most of the big hits, and is a nice blend of the old and new.  Besides classics like `Manic Monday', `Walk Like an Egyptian', and `Eternal Flame', there is a healthy dose of material from Doll Revolution, a remarkably excellent album.  `Here Right Now' is done in a mellow groove with an acoustic flavor, while `Between the Two' features a driving beat and some infectiously jangly guitar.  The kickass upbeat version of `Stealing Rosemary' has the band humming along at full speed, while the super bouncy Beatlesque `Get The Girl', from The Spy Who Shagged Me, is another cool tune.  Some of the older material like `Hero Takes a Fall', sound reenergized and edgier live.Unfortunately, the show is over much too soon, running about 70 minutes.  Rockers like `Walking Down Your Street', `Make a Play for Her Now' and `Different Light' would have been great additions.  Doll Revolution was a truly remarkable achievement, from which the band could have easily featured a few more songs.  Michael in particular shined on the album, and it would have been wonderful to see the haunting `Song for a Good Son' performed live, if it had been written at the time.The DVD features some nice extras, including intimate live performances of `Manic Monday' and `Ride the Ride' featuring acoustic guitars.  Hopefully some other songs were recorded in this session, and might be available someday.  `The Story of Bangelonia' is a short interview feature with the remaining members, Susanna Hoffs, and sisters Debbi and Vicki Peterson.  It's kind of usual, but there is a commentary track for the concert, also featuring Susanna, Debbi, and Vicki, offering lots of remembrances, both on and off topic.  It's not too serious, mostly for fun, and gives you some idea about the personalities of ladies.  It's a shame The Bangles haven't been more productive when it comes to recording, but that only makes this a release to be appreciated even more.  As of this date, The Bangles continue to tour, and hopefully will release some new music soon.",5,front row with The Bangles . . .,1247270400,"07 11, 2009",2009,4181,"['Return', 'Bangleonia', 'simply', 'must', 'have', 'fans', 'Bangles', 'music', 'career', 'band', 'mid', '80', 'latest', 'recording', 'Doll', 'Revolution', '2003', 'best', 'songs', 'magic', 'group', 'live', 'showcasing', 'musicianship', 'lead', 'harmony', 'vocals', 'are', 'signature', 'part', 'sound', 'Michael', 'Steele', 'left', 'group', 'performance', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'last', 'remembrances', 'featuring', 'original', 'members.One', 'pioneering', 'female', 'bands', 'rock', 'Bangles', 'found', 'commercial', 'success', '80', '60', 'influenced', 'brand', 'melodic', 'pop', 'rock', 'producing', 'albums', 'Place', '1984', 'Different', 'Light', '1986', 'Everything', '1988', 'group', 'disbanded', 'time', 'reformed', '1999', 'record', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'film', 'then', 'eventually', 'first', 'album', 'fifteen', 'years', 'Doll', 'Revolution', '2003', 'concert', 'was', 'shot', '2000', 'home', 'turf', 'House', 'Blues', 'Hollywood', 'band', 'musical', 'stuff', 'solidly', 'together', 'venue', 'great', 'ladies', 'look', 'fantastic', 'rocking', 'out', 'Joining', 'keyboards', 'Greg', 'Hilfman.The', 'vocals', 'are', 'ultra-critical', 'element', 'band', 'where', 'four', 'members', 'sing', 'lead', 'When', 'put', 'voices', 'together', 'get', 'something', 'can', 'be', 'really', 'special', 'greater', 'sum', 'parts', 'intimate', 'nature', 'Hard', 'Rock', 'ideal', 'venue', 'Bangles', 'where', 'vocals', 'clean', 'clear', 'guitar', 'sounds', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'heard', 'small', 'stage', 'audience', 'literally', 'few', 'feet', 'away', 'tight', 'camera', 'angles', 'make', 'feel', 'are', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'stage', 'grooving', 'rest', 'enthralled', 'audience', 'warm', 'happy', 'place', 'song', 'place', 'better', 'here', 'right', ""now'.There"", 'are', ""n't"", 'excessive', 'number', 'cameras', 'shooting', 'are', 'enough', 'good', 'coverage', 'variety', 'editing', 'mostly', 'well', 'done', 'sound', 'mix', 'marvelous', 'can', 'hear', 'individual', 'voices', 'instruments', 'quite', 'distinctly', 'bass', 'was', 'cranked', 'up', 'bit', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'perfect.The', 'set', 'list', 'most', 'big', 'hits', 'nice', 'blend', 'old', 'new', 'classics', 'Manic', 'Monday', 'Walk', 'Egyptian', 'Eternal', 'Flame', 'healthy', 'dose', 'material', 'Doll', 'Revolution', 'remarkably', 'excellent', 'album', 'Here', 'Right', 'Now', 'done', 'mellow', 'groove', 'acoustic', 'flavor', 'Two', 'features', 'driving', 'beat', 'infectiously', 'jangly', 'guitar', 'kickass', 'upbeat', 'version', 'Stealing', 'Rosemary', 'band', 'humming', 'along', 'full', 'speed', 'super', 'bouncy', 'Beatlesque', 'Get', 'Girl', 'Spy', 'Who', 'Shagged', 'Me', 'cool', 'tune', 'older', 'material', 'Hero', 'Takes', 'Fall', 'sound', 'reenergized', 'edgier', 'live.Unfortunately', 'show', 'over', 'much', 'too', 'soon', 'running', 'about', '70', 'minutes', 'Rockers', 'Walking', 'Down', 'Your', 'Street', 'Make', 'Play', 'Now', 'Different', 'Light', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'additions', 'Doll', 'Revolution', 'was', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'achievement', 'band', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'featured', 'few', 'more', 'songs', 'Michael', 'particular', 'shined', 'album', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'wonderful', 'see', 'haunting', 'Song', 'Good', 'Son', 'performed', 'live', 'had', 'been', 'written', 'time.The', 'DVD', 'nice', 'extras', 'including', 'intimate', 'live', 'performances', 'Manic', 'Monday', 'Ride', 'Ride', 'featuring', 'acoustic', 'guitars', 'Hopefully', 'other', 'songs', 'were', 'recorded', 'session', 'might', 'be', 'available', 'someday', 'Story', 'Bangelonia', 'short', 'interview', 'feature', 'remaining', 'members', 'Susanna', 'Hoffs', 'sisters', 'Debbi', 'Vicki', 'Peterson', 'kind', 'usual', 'commentary', 'track', 'concert', 'also', 'featuring', 'Susanna', 'Debbi', 'Vicki', 'offering', 'lots', 'remembrances', 'topic', 'not', 'too', 'serious', 'mostly', 'fun', 'idea', 'personalities', 'ladies', 'shame', 'Bangles', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'more', 'productive', 'when', 'recording', 'only', 'release', 'be', 'appreciated', 'even', 'more', 'date', 'Bangles', 'continue', 'tour', 'hopefully', 'will', 'release', 'new', 'music', 'soon']",The Bangles: Return to Bangleonia - Live in Concert
