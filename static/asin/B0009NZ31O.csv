The only part I didnt like was the laugh track.  Why on earth would you have a laugh track on a Scooby Doo cartoon?  Its insulting.  But overall a great DVD",4,Almost perfect,1125446400,"08 31, 2005",2005,301,"['DVD', 'full', 'surprises', 'good', 'one', 'not', 'liked', 'episodes', 'especially', 'first', 'one', 'cameo', 'KISS', 'halloween', 'party', 'only', 'part', 'didnt', 'was', 'laugh', 'track', 'Why', 'earth', 'would', 'have', 'laugh', 'track', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'cartoon', 'insulting', 'overall', 'great', 'DVD']","What's New Scooby-Doo, Vol. 6 - Monster Matinee"
