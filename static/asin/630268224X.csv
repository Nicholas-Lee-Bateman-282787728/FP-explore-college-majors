This is remastered in high definition (whatever that means). For an early 30's film, the images are sharp and clear with nary a sign of deterioration so common among the other economical B western products. Tim McCoy fans are lucky to have this one. But this is essentially being marketed as an early John Wayne western. Duke was not lead man but a supporting character to McCoy. But that's marketing for you. Columbia should release more B westerns kept in their vaults. The two Charles Starret releases are moves in the right direction. Another good Tim McCoy copy is Ghost Patrol by Alpha. The other Alpha Tim McCoy releases strain the eyes. I still have to try the VCI Mc Coy movies though frankly, I was disappointed by  their Buck Jones releases which are not of the same high standards seen in Texas Cyclone.",5,More Pristine McCoy Movies PLEASE!!!,1119398400,"06 22, 2005",2005,959,"['currently', 'available', 'B', 'western', 'movies', 'Tim', 'McCoy', 'are', 'far', 'few', 'Texas', 'Cyclone', 'Columbia', 'presently', 'best', 'lot', 'remastered', 'high', 'definition', 'early', '30', 'film', 'images', 'are', 'sharp', 'clear', 'sign', 'deterioration', 'common', 'other', 'economical', 'B', 'western', 'products', 'Tim', 'McCoy', 'fans', 'are', 'lucky', 'have', 'one', 'essentially', 'being', 'marketed', 'early', 'John', 'Wayne', 'western', 'Duke', 'was', 'not', 'lead', 'man', 'supporting', 'character', 'McCoy', 'marketing', 'Columbia', 'should', 'release', 'more', 'B', 'westerns', 'kept', 'vaults', 'two', 'Charles', 'Starret', 'releases', 'are', 'moves', 'right', 'direction', 'good', 'Tim', 'McCoy', 'copy', 'Ghost', 'Patrol', 'Alpha', 'other', 'Alpha', 'Tim', 'McCoy', 'strain', 'eyes', 'still', 'have', 'try', 'VCI', 'Mc', 'Coy', 'movies', 'frankly', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Buck', 'Jones', 'releases', 'are', 'not', 'same', 'high', 'standards', 'seen', 'Texas', 'Cyclone']",N/A

The more of Tim McCoy I see, the more I like him. He's such an oddball, though quiet about it. Love the hat and the 8, or is it 9 shirtsleeve buttons in a row. It's a good B Western story. For an added bonus we have John Wayne as almost-the-Duke, and as a real delight, Walter Brennan as almost_Walter Brennan. It might seem expensive for an hour-long black and white B-western but when you consider the rediculous quality of some of the cheaper versions of these westerns out there, this is well worth it. I still buy those cheap ones anyway, since that's all we can get.I've changed this review, was 4 stars, now on second thought, I'm giving it 5 (though I can't seem to change the star rating).Please, please, please, we need more like this!

He is not in much of it at all. It is a Tim McCoy western and it follows the basic formula save the helpless girl, save the ranch get the bad guys. It a fun move and kids safe. The basis is Tim McCoy rides into town he mistaken for another man. Then he starts to pretend to be that man. I really enjoyed this movie. It will bring back memories of the ""Little Rascals"" every time you see the horses rideThe Video:All though it does list itself as remastered in HD is not as clear as it could be. If you seen any of the ""I love Lucy"" sets you have seem what can be done with black and white film. It has some specs though it doesn't jump anywhere. I watched this on my 60 inch Sony Wega and am sorry to say its grainy a lot of places. No spots or dirt though just complete grain thru most of the picture. Of course it is shot in full screen since the aspects of the theaters were 4:3 back then.The AudioIts mono and done in true 1930's style where u can see they are feeling out how to place microphones. It's crisp though easy to hear not going to wake the neighbors on this track but its easy on the ears.SummaryIf you just want a fun western with a little bit of the young duke in it this movie is for you.

It's hard to say about the running time of 57 minutes(most sources say 63).  The worst of it is that the opening credits and end title have all been replaced by a re-issuer(Gail Pictures).  This DVD put out by Sony uses a re-issued print, which is disgraceful.  I can only assume they have no original print of this.  Here we have a very good example of how studios did not take care of their films.  Studios treated some of their films bad enough, but the re-issuers were even worse.  All references to Columbia have been removed and the replaced credits look horrible.

327748,A2I50NEFF3BCM7,630268224X,S. D. Miles,"[8, 8]","This one is remastered in High Definition; which proberly means that a great more care was taken during the process. The end result is a sharp, clear, black and white print that may have been filmed only yesterday instead of in 1932, the 73 years differential isn't at all apparent. Infact, if this one had been filmed yesterday the critics would be full of praise for the black and white photography, it's really that good.John Wayne has a supporting role, (third in the credits after Shirley Grey) but his screen presence is already very evident throughout.Tim McCoy's steely eyed presence really screams out that he is the star of this one, and rightly so. I've not seen a weak movie with Tim McCoy, oater's maybe, but all have good scripts with good plots. Not so well known today, it is unfortunate that his rising star coincided with that of Tom Mix and Buck Jones, and although he made some excellent films in the 1930's and '40's he was overshadowed by Gene Audrey, Johnny Mack Brown, Roy Rogers, and others, including of course ""Hoppy"". He left the excellent Rough Riders series to serve his country in WW2 (he was in the Army Reserve) and on his return, as far as I am aware and I must look it up, his movie career then passed into oblivion.Back to the movie. It is also great to see a 1932 Walter Brennan, his screen presence also grabs you to take notice. It is great to see Bud Osbourne, (not credited) one of the reliable bad guys from yester-year, without all the wear and tear scratches that one usually sees in old ""B"" Westens from repeated showings.I only received this one today, then played it, and then I couldn't wait to review it. Highly recommended, buy it, even at the relatively high price for a ""B"" movie of this vintage, the experience is worth having. The five stars are for the exceptional quality of the print. I would give the film three and a half for story and production values.It's worth noting, for non Region 1 viewers, that although this one is marked as Region 1 on the cover it is in fact uncoded and will play anywhere in the world.",5,"More like this one, please!",1131494400,"11 9, 2005",2005,2074,"['one', 'remastered', 'High', 'Definition', 'proberly', 'great', 'more', 'care', 'was', 'taken', 'process', 'end', 'result', 'sharp', 'clear', 'black', 'white', 'print', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'only', 'yesterday', 'instead', '1932', '73', 'years', 'differential', ""n't"", 'apparent', 'Infact', 'one', 'had', 'been', 'filmed', 'yesterday', 'critics', 'would', 'be', 'full', 'praise', 'black', 'white', 'photography', 'really', 'good.John', 'Wayne', 'supporting', 'role', 'third', 'credits', 'Shirley', 'Grey', 'screen', 'presence', 'already', 'very', 'evident', 'throughout.Tim', 'McCoy', 'steely', 'eyed', 'presence', 'really', 'out', 'star', 'one', 'rightly', 'so', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'weak', 'movie', 'Tim', 'McCoy', 'oater', 'maybe', 'have', 'good', 'scripts', 'good', 'plots', 'Not', 'so', 'well', 'known', 'today', 'unfortunate', 'rising', 'star', 'coincided', 'Tom', 'Mix', 'Buck', 'Jones', 'made', 'excellent', 'films', '1930', 'was', 'overshadowed', 'Gene', 'Audrey', 'Johnny', 'Mack', 'Brown', 'Roy', 'Rogers', 'others', 'including', 'course', 'Hoppy', 'left', 'excellent', 'Rough', 'Riders', 'series', 'serve', 'country', 'WW2', 'was', 'Army', 'Reserve', 'return', 'as', 'far', 'am', 'aware', 'must', 'look', 'up', 'movie', 'career', 'then', 'passed', 'oblivion.Back', 'movie', 'also', 'great', 'see', '1932', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'screen', 'presence', 'also', 'take', 'notice', 'great', 'see', 'Bud', 'Osbourne', 'not', 'credited', 'one', 'reliable', 'bad', 'guys', 'yester-year', 'wear', 'tear', 'scratches', 'one', 'usually', 'old', 'B', 'repeated', 'showings.I', 'only', 'received', 'one', 'today', 'then', 'played', 'then', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'review', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'buy', 'even', 'relatively', 'high', 'price', 'B', 'movie', 'vintage', 'experience', 'worth', 'having', 'five', 'stars', 'are', 'exceptional', 'quality', 'print', 'would', 'give', 'film', 'three', 'half', 'story', 'production', 'values.It', 'worth', 'noting', 'non', 'Region', '1', 'viewers', 'one', 'marked', 'Region', '1', 'cover', 'fact', 'uncoded', 'will', 'play', 'anywhere', 'world']",N/A
