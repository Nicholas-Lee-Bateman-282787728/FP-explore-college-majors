731541,A2B62696PNFIJO,B00007LB4B,"""hawkjet""","[6, 9]","My title indicates why this is a straight to video movie. I first starting admiring jessica in the early 90's when she was in Flipper. She was believable then and just amazing in Dark Angel, so it was surprising that her acting was so awful in this movie. The writing could've been better but the nudity issue is indicative of her acting in this flick. A QUICK SYNOPSIS: An Englishman-officer candidate-is sent to a foreign post to learn how to be an administrator. Soon after he arrives he is told that Selima (jessica's character) is to be his tutor in that tribe's language and customs. Since she needs to be with him 24/7 she is expected to sleep with him as this has been the custom for 300 years. He is horrified at first but succumbs to her charms. Then both violate custom by falling in love. Events snowball after this. Back to the nudity argument. You see breasts, but not at the same time you see her face. At one point you see her bare back as she's in bed with the Englishman. As she rolls off him you can see the pasties she's glued to her breasts. She holds back in the lovemaking scenes and seems apprehensive in half a dozen scenes. Jessica is capable of so much more. As the lovers realize their love is causing harm, jessica's performance is less than convincing. Late in the movie, jessica's character is being abused by the new administrator. With the help of a drunk houseboy, she beats up the administrator, but not very well. Anyone who has dated a Phillipino woman or watched Dark Angel knows that Jesica should be able to trash this guy on her own. Thus my justification that Katie Holmes would've been better in the role.",2,Jessica has a Lackluster Performance,1046736000,"03 4, 2003",2003,1648,"['title', 'why', 'straight', 'video', 'movie', 'first', 'starting', 'admiring', 'jessica', 'early', '90', 'when', 'was', 'Flipper', 'was', 'believable', 'then', 'just', 'amazing', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'was', 'surprising', 'acting', 'was', 'so', 'awful', 'movie', 'writing', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'nudity', 'issue', 'indicative', 'acting', 'flick', 'QUICK', 'SYNOPSIS', 'Englishman-officer', 'candidate-is', 'sent', 'foreign', 'post', 'learn', 'how', 'be', 'administrator', 'Soon', 'told', 'Selima', 'jessica', 'character', 'be', 'tutor', 'tribe', 'language', 'customs', 'be', '24/7', 'expected', 'sleep', 'been', 'custom', '300', 'years', 'horrified', 'first', 'succumbs', 'charms', 'Then', 'violate', 'custom', 'falling', 'love', 'Events', 'snowball', 'Back', 'nudity', 'argument', 'see', 'breasts', 'not', 'same', 'time', 'see', 'face', 'one', 'point', 'see', 'bare', 'back', 'bed', 'Englishman', 'can', 'see', 'pasties', 'glued', 'breasts', 'back', 'lovemaking', 'scenes', 'apprehensive', 'dozen', 'scenes', 'Jessica', 'capable', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'lovers', 'realize', 'love', 'causing', 'harm', 'jessica', 'performance', 'less', 'convincing', 'Late', 'movie', 'jessica', 'character', 'being', 'abused', 'new', 'administrator', 'help', 'drunk', 'houseboy', 'administrator', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'Anyone', 'who', 'dated', 'Phillipino', 'woman', 'watched', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'Jesica', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'trash', 'guy', 'own', 'Thus', 'justification', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'role']",The Sleeping Dictionary
731542,AGVIUNALLAV3Q,B00007LB4B,H. Frick,"[1, 2]","Funny this 2003 film was not widely released in movie theaters. I think it would have done well. I realize though that Jessica Alba had not appeared in a major movie yet at that time, maybe that's what had caused the reservations to not show it widely in theaters.The movie is set in Sarawak, Malaysia in 1930. A young British officer arrives with high ambitions to continue the work that his father (killed in the war) had started, namely to bring education to the native Iban tribe. He is paired with a so-called sleeping dictionary, in his case a bi-lingual native (Alba) with the intent to fast-teach him the local language using her bedroom skills.I found all the acting to be pretty decent, including Alba's. She did go back and forth between having an accent and not having one, and also between being an Iban and being Alba. I admit though that being male it's probably impossible to not like her however bad her acting would be :-) . Hugh Dancy was believable in transforming from a stiff British college grad to a likeable young man. Bob Hoskin (self-proclaimed ""god"" in the colony) did a good job representing the values of the motherland while still showing heart and overall being fair and likeable.The set of course offers breathtaking views of the jungle, and the depiction of the natives is believable. I was glad for the happy ending (I am a sucker for feel-good movies I admit), although how well both Bob's character and his 100% british daughter, now the wife of the young officer, take his departure (after all, they just learned that his wife is pregnant), is of course indeed very nice and shows their maturity as humans, but altogether not fully believable. This would be too good to be true in real life.This is a movie that shows some of the conflicts inevitable when such different cultures as the stiff British society of 70 years ago and an unencumbered live-in-the-day people like friendly Malaysian head-hunters of those days interfere with each other. It does not go really deep though in explaining the conflicts and will not leave you all stirred up.",4,The Sleeping Dictionary,1192320000,"10 14, 2007",2007,2084,"['2003', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'widely', 'released', 'movie', 'theaters', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'well', 'realize', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'had', 'not', 'appeared', 'major', 'movie', 'yet', 'time', 'maybe', 'what', 'had', 'caused', 'reservations', 'not', 'show', 'widely', 'theaters.The', 'movie', 'set', 'Sarawak', 'Malaysia', '1930', 'young', 'British', 'officer', 'high', 'ambitions', 'continue', 'work', 'father', 'killed', 'war', 'had', 'started', 'namely', 'bring', 'education', 'native', 'Iban', 'tribe', 'paired', 'so-called', 'sleeping', 'dictionary', 'case', 'bi-lingual', 'native', 'Alba', 'intent', 'fast-teach', 'local', 'language', 'using', 'bedroom', 'skills.I', 'found', 'acting', 'be', 'pretty', 'decent', 'including', 'Alba', 'did', 'go', 'back', 'forth', 'having', 'accent', 'not', 'having', 'one', 'also', 'being', 'Iban', 'being', 'Alba', 'admit', 'being', 'male', 'probably', 'impossible', 'not', 'however', 'bad', 'acting', 'would', 'be', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'was', 'believable', 'transforming', 'stiff', 'British', 'college', 'grad', 'likeable', 'young', 'man', 'Bob', 'Hoskin', 'self-proclaimed', 'god', 'colony', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'representing', 'values', 'motherland', 'still', 'showing', 'heart', 'overall', 'being', 'fair', 'likeable.The', 'set', 'course', 'offers', 'breathtaking', 'views', 'jungle', 'depiction', 'natives', 'believable', 'was', 'glad', 'happy', 'ending', 'am', 'sucker', 'feel-good', 'movies', 'admit', 'how', 'well', 'Bob', 'character', '100', '%', 'british', 'daughter', 'now', 'wife', 'young', 'officer', 'take', 'departure', 'just', 'learned', 'wife', 'pregnant', 'course', 'indeed', 'very', 'nice', 'maturity', 'humans', 'altogether', 'not', 'fully', 'believable', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'real', 'life.This', 'movie', 'conflicts', 'inevitable', 'when', 'such', 'different', 'cultures', 'stiff', 'British', 'society', '70', 'years', 'ago', 'unencumbered', 'live-in-the-day', 'people', 'friendly', 'Malaysian', 'head-hunters', 'days', 'interfere', 'other', 'not', 'go', 'really', 'deep', 'explaining', 'conflicts', 'will', 'not', 'leave', 'stirred', 'up']",The Sleeping Dictionary
731543,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00007LB4B,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[4, 10]","The English will go on harping on their colonial past for quite many decades still. That past is for them a source of guilt and they cannot erase it or even alleviate it enough to accept it as past and no longer that pregnant with meaning. In this case we are in Sarawak. A young British officer is provided with a native woman who is supposed to teach him the local language in bed. But this is absolutely secret and even denied, even among people who actually know. The young officer of course is supposed to take advantage of the situation then marry a good English girl to abide by his national duty. And that's it. The film of course takes the case in which the young officer falls in love with the girl. Rejection, fake accusations, everything will be used to force the English officer to do his duty, and to get the native girl and other natives out of the way. And yet the film moves forward onto a rather sentimentalese ending that avoids the tragic force it could have had. It also avoids really discovering the native surrounding culture that remains anecdotal, exotic and rather simplified in feelings. Apart from that it is a rewriting of Romeo and Juliet but with the happy ending of an escape into the wilderness. Furthermore, the film points out the real negative dimension of this colonialism : to force a foreign culture, a foreign language and even a foreign life style onto people who should have been able to righteously keep their language, their culture and their life style and evolve from what could appear as a primitive civilization to a more advanced state but on their own logic and dynamic. No one has the right to force any people to adopt a mode of thinking and a life style that does not come from their own heritage and tradition.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",4,Inter-ethnic love was forever impossible in colonial Britain,1161734400,"10 25, 2006",2006,1857,"['English', 'will', 'go', 'harping', 'colonial', 'past', 'quite', 'many', 'decades', 'still', 'past', 'source', 'guilt', 'can', 'not', 'erase', 'even', 'alleviate', 'enough', 'accept', 'past', 'longer', 'pregnant', 'meaning', 'case', 'are', 'Sarawak', 'A', 'young', 'British', 'officer', 'provided', 'native', 'woman', 'who', 'supposed', 'teach', 'local', 'language', 'bed', 'absolutely', 'secret', 'even', 'denied', 'even', 'people', 'who', 'actually', 'know', 'young', 'officer', 'course', 'supposed', 'take', 'advantage', 'situation', 'then', 'marry', 'good', 'English', 'girl', 'abide', 'national', 'duty', 'film', 'course', 'case', 'young', 'officer', 'love', 'girl', 'Rejection', 'fake', 'accusations', 'everything', 'will', 'be', 'used', 'force', 'English', 'officer', 'do', 'duty', 'get', 'native', 'girl', 'other', 'natives', 'way', 'yet', 'film', 'forward', 'rather', 'sentimentalese', 'ending', 'tragic', 'force', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'also', 'really', 'discovering', 'native', 'surrounding', 'culture', 'anecdotal', 'exotic', 'rather', 'simplified', 'feelings', 'Apart', 'rewriting', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'happy', 'ending', 'escape', 'wilderness', 'Furthermore', 'film', 'points', 'out', 'real', 'negative', 'dimension', 'colonialism', 'force', 'foreign', 'culture', 'foreign', 'language', 'even', 'foreign', 'life', 'style', 'people', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'righteously', 'keep', 'language', 'culture', 'life', 'style', 'evolve', 'what', 'could', 'appear', 'primitive', 'civilization', 'more', 'advanced', 'state', 'own', 'logic', 'dynamic', 'one', 'right', 'force', 'people', 'adopt', 'mode', 'thinking', 'life', 'style', 'not', 'come', 'own', 'heritage', 'tradition.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne']",The Sleeping Dictionary

731545,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B00007LB4B,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[9, 12]","This is a film that had a good idea, and good execution of what the idea turned into. It is a shame the film never appeared in theaters as the visuals of Sarawak would have been great on the large screen and the audio and music are well done and would have benefited from a theatrical environment. Unfortunately, a little bit more planning would have helped. At 109 minutes, this film won't bore you, but it could have been rightfully intriguing with 20-30 minutes of good plot added. The film is carried on the sound film-making and charm of it's actors. In particular, Alba is really good. She plays the part with the seriousness it was intended, and never lets her intentionally accented English fall into 'stupid foreigner' stereotype, a tough job for many young actors and actresses who have attempted the same. Her partner, Hugh Dancy, is good enough. He channels a little bit like a scrawny Heath Ledger, but never quite gets rugged enough.The other joy of the cast is the ever-underrated Bob Hoskins. By coincidence, I saw 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' a couple of weeks ago before watching 'Sleeping Dictionary,' and am never let down by his appearances in films. He plays a character who isn't written subtly enough; still, he acts it. The endless looks of ""Damn bloody fool. Good for him, the w***er"" scattered through the film isn't enough for a man of his caliber, but we'll take what we can get. Their performances are weaved together well by Writer/Director Guy Jenkin, who is making his big screen debut as a director, though his writing career goes back to the late '70's without much acclaim. Directing-wise, he knows what he is doing. The camera work is graceful and beautiful, and he compliments the fantastic elements of the story well. As a writer, well, there are things left to be desired.Most of all, this film seems too short. The story is predictable, but it never drags. The love scenes are contrived, as is the underdeveloped climax, but that's not where the film is weak. The characters are cleverly set up to be mirrors, and the overlapping triangles are so complex they rival those brainteasers that ask 'how many triangles are in this picture?' The problem is, the most important one is never realized, because of the lack of development between Dancy and his best friend within the tribe. Without much difficulty, and a little more time, that relationship alone would have lifted this film from not quite enough to a good, if not better, movie.As a result, you're left with a film that doesn't challenge anything because it just challenges the same old things. But it is romantic, and has much more spark than many other movies you may see of this type.

But, unfortunately, as it stands--it is more of an interesting failure. Set in 1939 Malaysia, the film's locale does offer a colorful and lush backdrop to the story. Hugh Dancy stars as a British official who is sent into the jungle to ""civilize"" the natives.  His actual job functions, though, are somewhat sketchy and superfluous. Any time the film spends looking at his actual ""work"" is only done to provide broad culture clash comedy. He meets a Malaysian girl (Jessica Alba) who is to serve as his sleeping dictionary, a term used to describe someone who will teach him the local language and warm his bed. Of course, the two actually fall in love which brings about a whole new series of complications.Now if this is supposed to be 1939 Malaysia, it is absolutely the most modernized and Westernized version possible. I couldn't take this picture seriously for a moment. Getting past that, though, the first half of the movie wants to be a frothy comedy while the second half shifts focus into a romantic tragedy. This jarring tonal switch is not wholly effective. By playing the first part so light, the film doesn't get us to invest in its story or characters. When things turn more serious, then, it might hold your interest but you are never emotionally involved.I actually like the fact that Jessica Alba wanted to try a film of a more serious nature, but sadly she falls short. Half the picture, she slinks around like a playful kitten uttering lines more fitting to a modern romantic comedy than a period piece. It's so out of place as to be disconcerting, but most of the blame really falls on the script's shortcomings. For those of you purely interested in Alba as a physical specimen--there is a fair amount of sex. She does, however, contort around unbelievably so as not to show any actual skin (except for a couple of obvious body double moments). As for her believability as a Malaysian--I'll be kind and succinct and say it just doesn't work.Hugh Dancy is far more successful as the idealistic official and Bob Hoskins and Brenda Blethyn are reliable, as always. For those looking for a really spirited romantic, exotic epic--I'd suggest Michael Mann's sublime ""Last of the Mohicans."" I just didn't connect with this film in the way necessary to make it really memorable. It's not a disaster, it is just unrealized potential.  For me, I'm sad to say it only merits about 2 1/2 stars which I'll round up because it's pretty to look at.

Talha ""Weird Gurl""","[17, 22]","In the not-so-distant past, young British men, fresh out of university, were sent to outposts of the Empire to practice their administrative skills on one of the many races subjugated by the British at the time. This film follows young John Truscott (Hugh Dancy) as he arrives in Sarawak (now part of Malaysia) in 1936 for his stint - he is idealistic, and full of ideas for educating and civilising the primitives. He is startled to be met by a tattooed native who speaks perfect English, and who introduces himself as Belansei (Eugene Salleh). Belansei takes him upriver, where he meets Henry Bullard (Bob Hoskins), who is governor of the district. Truscott is assigned a hut, a cook (who cooks well, but drinks heavily), and, to his surprise, a ""sleeping dictionary"". A sleeping dictionary, he is informed, is a young woman who will sleep with him and teach him the local language. Truscott is shocked, and upset, although he feels very attracted to Selima (Jessica Alba). He refuses to sleep with her, but offers to learn the language from her. Bullard is angry, because he is rocking the boat and refusing to follow tradition, even though this is the way things have been done for centuries.Truscott yields to propinquity, however, and falls in love with Selima, and she with him. This love is deepened when they experience danger together. He wants to marry her, but this is forbidden by British traditions, and all manner of retribution will fall upon them should they persist. Instead, Bullard's wife, the manipulative Aggie (Brenda Blethyn), pushes him to marry her daughter Cecilia (Emily Mortimer, who plays this role in unflattering make-up so she looks plain). This doesn't make the other young British administrator, Neville Shipperly (played with superb chinless sleaze by Noah Taylor) at all happy, for he had designs upon Cecilia for himself.Jessica Alba's acting skills are fairly limited (not that she's required to do much here), and easily surpassed by Hugh Dancy, who does a superb job of English prig on arrival, gradually learning that the Iban, and others, are people too.This film was shot in Malaysia, and the river and jungle scenery is really quite lovely.The love story is nicely told, set among the ugliness of British colonialism.",4,Visually entertaining,1105315200,"01 10, 2005",2005,2262,"['not-so-distant', 'past', 'young', 'British', 'men', 'fresh', 'university', 'were', 'sent', 'outposts', 'Empire', 'practice', 'administrative', 'skills', 'one', 'many', 'races', 'subjugated', 'British', 'time', 'film', 'young', 'John', 'Truscott', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'Sarawak', 'now', 'part', 'Malaysia', '1936', 'stint', 'idealistic', 'full', 'ideas', 'educating', 'civilising', 'primitives', 'startled', 'be', 'met', 'tattooed', 'native', 'who', 'perfect', 'English', 'who', 'Belansei', 'Eugene', 'Salleh', 'Belansei', 'upriver', 'where', 'Henry', 'Bullard', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'who', 'governor', 'district', 'Truscott', 'assigned', 'hut', 'cook', 'who', 'well', 'drinks', 'heavily', 'surprise', 'sleeping', 'dictionary', 'sleeping', 'dictionary', 'informed', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'will', 'sleep', 'teach', 'local', 'language', 'Truscott', 'shocked', 'upset', 'very', 'attracted', 'Selima', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'sleep', 'learn', 'language', 'Bullard', 'angry', 'rocking', 'boat', 'refusing', 'follow', 'tradition', 'even', 'way', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'centuries.Truscott', 'yields', 'propinquity', 'however', 'love', 'Selima', 'love', 'deepened', 'when', 'experience', 'danger', 'together', 'marry', 'forbidden', 'British', 'traditions', 'manner', 'retribution', 'will', 'fall', 'should', 'persist', 'Instead', 'Bullard', 'wife', 'manipulative', 'Aggie', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'marry', 'daughter', 'Cecilia', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'who', 'role', 'unflattering', 'make-up', 'plain', ""n't"", 'make', 'other', 'young', 'British', 'administrator', 'Neville', 'Shipperly', 'played', 'superb', 'chinless', 'sleaze', 'Noah', 'Taylor', 'happy', 'had', 'designs', 'Cecilia', 'himself.Jessica', 'Alba', 'acting', 'skills', 'are', 'fairly', 'limited', 'not', 'required', 'do', 'much', 'here', 'easily', 'surpassed', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'who', 'superb', 'job', 'English', 'prig', 'arrival', 'gradually', 'learning', 'Iban', 'others', 'are', 'people', 'too.This', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Malaysia', 'river', 'jungle', 'scenery', 'really', 'quite', 'lovely.The', 'love', 'story', 'nicely', 'told', 'set', 'ugliness', 'British', 'colonialism']",The Sleeping Dictionary

Bernabo,"[66, 72]","&quot;The Sleeping Dictionary&quot; was a direct to video film, which is rather surprisingly given both its cast and its look, as borne out by the film winning four DVD Exclusive Awards in 2003 for Best Actress Jessica Alba, Best Cinematography by Martin Fuhrer, Best Supporting Actor Bob Hoskins, and Best Supporting Actress Brenda Blethyn.  This really is too good of a film to be a DVD Premier Movie, but hopefully word will get around, even if it is to check out Jessica Alba wearing colorful tribal outfits.The setting is Sarawak, Malaysia in 1937, when young John Truscott (Hugh Dancy), fresh out of university (where he tended to read books), has come to serve his Majesty's government as an official of the Empire.  The regional governor is Henry Bullard (Hoskins), who oversees the Iban, a tribe of friendly headhunters.  John, like his father, has a dream of educating the Iban children, but that requires him to learn the local language and customs.  The governor arranges for John to have a &quot;sleeping dictionary,&quot; a local girl who will both teach the young Englishmen to speak the language and tutor him in the ways of love.The girl selected for John is Selima (Alba), who is half Iban and have British.  John initially resists the second part of his education, but in the end falls in love with this beautiful and sensual woman, which violates the taboos of both cultures.  Meanwhile, the governor wants his daughter, Cecil (Emily Mortimer) to marry John, and the situation conspires to give our young hero no choice but to stick to the elitist traditions of his own people.  Cecil and her mother (Blethyn) know about the sleeping dictionaries, but it turns out that neither they nor John know everything about Selima and the solution to John's problems that is arranged at the end of the film's first act becomes unraveled in the second.This is a beautiful film from writer-director Guy Jenkin, full of stunning visuals of the lush jungle of Sarawak and the native peoples.  Simon Boswell's musical score perfectly compliments the visual splendor.  The only real weakness on that side of the camera is the editing, where key moments are shoved aside to move on to the next scene too quickly a couple of times.  But the strength of &quot;The Sleeping Dictionary&quot; is in front of the camera, not only in terms of the gorgeous images but the solid performances from the entire cast.  Even those who are disappointed that there is a body double for Alba in the nude scenes or that her accent is problematic at times are not going to be disappointed they checked out this 2002 film.Unfortunately New Line Cinema skimped on the extras for this DVD.  All we get is are trailers, mostly for other films, and no insights into whether the sleeping dictionary is a real tradition or part of Jenkins' imagination.  One of the joys of a well made period piece is a look at the fun the cast and crew had with getting it right on screen.",4,A beautiful direct to DVD period movie with Jessica Alba,1084838400,"05 18, 2004",2004,2950,"['quot', 'Sleeping', 'Dictionary', 'quot', 'was', 'direct', 'video', 'film', 'rather', 'surprisingly', 'given', 'cast', 'look', 'borne', 'out', 'film', 'winning', 'four', 'DVD', 'Exclusive', 'Awards', '2003', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'Best', 'Cinematography', 'Martin', 'Fuhrer', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'really', 'too', 'good', 'film', 'be', 'DVD', 'Premier', 'Movie', 'hopefully', 'word', 'will', 'get', 'even', 'check', 'out', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'wearing', 'colorful', 'tribal', 'outfits.The', 'setting', 'Sarawak', 'Malaysia', '1937', 'when', 'young', 'John', 'Truscott', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'fresh', 'university', 'where', 'tended', 'read', 'books', 'come', 'serve', 'Majesty', 'government', 'official', 'Empire', 'regional', 'governor', 'Henry', 'Bullard', 'Hoskins', 'who', 'Iban', 'tribe', 'friendly', 'headhunters', 'John', 'father', 'dream', 'educating', 'Iban', 'children', 'learn', 'local', 'language', 'customs', 'governor', 'John', 'have', 'quot', 'sleeping', 'dictionary', 'quot', 'local', 'girl', 'who', 'will', 'teach', 'young', 'Englishmen', 'speak', 'language', 'tutor', 'ways', 'love.The', 'girl', 'selected', 'John', 'Selima', 'Alba', 'who', 'half', 'Iban', 'have', 'British', 'John', 'initially', 'second', 'part', 'education', 'end', 'love', 'beautiful', 'sensual', 'woman', 'taboos', 'cultures', 'Meanwhile', 'governor', 'daughter', 'Cecil', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'marry', 'John', 'situation', 'give', 'young', 'hero', 'choice', 'stick', 'elitist', 'traditions', 'own', 'people', 'Cecil', 'mother', 'Blethyn', 'know', 'sleeping', 'dictionaries', 'out', 'John', 'know', 'everything', 'Selima', 'solution', 'John', 'problems', 'arranged', 'end', 'film', 'first', 'act', 'unraveled', 'second.This', 'beautiful', 'film', 'writer-director', 'Guy', 'Jenkin', 'full', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'lush', 'jungle', 'Sarawak', 'native', 'peoples', 'Simon', 'Boswell', 'musical', 'score', 'perfectly', 'visual', 'splendor', 'only', 'real', 'weakness', 'side', 'camera', 'editing', 'where', 'key', 'moments', 'are', 'shoved', 'aside', 'move', 'next', 'scene', 'too', 'quickly', 'couple', 'times', 'strength', 'quot', 'Sleeping', 'Dictionary', 'quot', 'front', 'camera', 'not', 'only', 'terms', 'gorgeous', 'images', 'solid', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'Even', 'who', 'are', 'disappointed', 'body', 'double', 'Alba', 'nude', 'scenes', 'accent', 'problematic', 'times', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'disappointed', 'checked', 'out', '2002', 'film.Unfortunately', 'New', 'Line', 'Cinema', 'skimped', 'extras', 'DVD', 'get', 'are', 'trailers', 'mostly', 'other', 'films', 'insights', 'sleeping', 'dictionary', 'real', 'tradition', 'part', 'Jenkins', 'imagination', 'One', 'joys', 'well', 'made', 'period', 'piece', 'look', 'fun', 'cast', 'crew', 'had', 'getting', 'right', 'screen']",The Sleeping Dictionary

The fact that it had a surprisingly high-powered cast I found out later. And despite itself, the movie managed to keep me interested, so it wasn't that bad.The time: the 1930s. The place: Borneo, the English bit. John Truscott (Ella Enchanted's Hugh Dancy) is fresh out of school and ready to civilize the barbarians. The local guv'nor (Bob Hoskins) and his wife (Little Voice's Brenda Blethyn) try to keep Truscott stiff-upper-lip British while acclimatizing him to the local customs, the oddest of them being that an Englishman's language tutor is also his bedmate-- the ""sleeping dictionary"" of the title. Of course, said sleeping dictionaries are to be used and left so the stiff upper etc. can go back to society and marry a proper English girl. More fool Truscott, then, for his SD is Selima (Jessica Alba), who is, well, devastatingly hot. Needless to say, his upper lip wilts relatively quickly (all the blood must have rushed off somewhere else)-- just in time to find out that the guv'nor is setting Truscott up with his daughter Cecil (Red Dragon's Emily Mortimer), whom guv desperately hopes he'll marry to keep her out of the clutches of Neville (Max's Noah Taylor), whom no one likes.It's all got that vaguely superior ""but, fatha, the natives are people just like us!"" feel to it that aspires to equality and yet still retains a distinct, though faint, odor of racism-- lily-white chap learns to love the natives despite their barbaric ways and all that nonsense. Still, for mildly offensive formula filmmaking, it's at least watchable, and Truscott's stubborn refusal to let go of his naivete comes off both stupid and, in its way, charming. The characters are two-dimensional, for the most part (Hoskins' character is predictable, but at least slightly thicker than the rest of the cardboard cutouts). You could pull up the English colonials and drop in thirties superheroes, and they wouldn't really seem out of place.Despite all this, and despite my best efforts, I found myself-- not liking it, really, but not hating it, either. I probably wouldn't watch it again, but I don't feel like demanding my money back.

And anyone who knows anything about making movies aside from watching them knows that just because the cut to the face of the actor/actress, is not an indicator that it is the actor/actress doing the nude scene.

According to the film, the long-standing custom has it that to learn the language of the place, the newly arrived officers are to sleep with the native girls every night.Pillow talk is the best way to learn foreign words, so the film says, and most guys would agree with that idea.  Not John.  John refused to follow the custom, but anyway you know it's Jessica Alba.  Selima is a spirited girl, but this time it is not futuristic world of ""Dark Angel,"" but deep in the forest of exotic Asia, so who can resist?  But after they come to really love each other, complicated things start to happen, making them look like Romeo and Juliet, only difference being there could be a way out.The film is actually good.  Acting is superb, especially the two leads, and you got Bob Hoskins, Brenda Blethyn, Emily Mortimer, and Noah Taylor.  The location is perfect because the film was shot there, so jungles look really jungles, not some park in California.  The humid atmophere which must have annoyed the cast and the crew can be felt on the screen, and Ms. Alba looks like the character she is playing, even though, thanks to her former TV appearance, I still feel that she could get out of any trouble, eliminating every one of them in her way with ease.But why three stars, you might say?  Sorry, it's the story, which can be divided into two parts.  The first, gentler one is much more engaging and charming than the second, contrived one.  Hugh Dancy and Jessica Alba make a truly charming pair, first spurning then accepting each other, and that type of essense makes a really good film, the first-time director Guy Jenkin should have known.  Instead, like Jodie Foster's ""Anna and the King,"" the latter half goes into a maze of actions and intrigues, never knowing how to get out of that gracefully.  Strangely Mr. Hoskins' & Ms. Blethyn's characters suddenly show the wide variety of emotions, which make them look quite silly sometimes.  The film leaps from one emotion to another without giving sufficient time for us to be sympathetic, and in this way undermines the romance between the likable youngsters which should have been left intact.The film doesn't know how to tell a good story of love.  We don't need to see a ""villain"" in this boy-meets-girl story -- the same kind of mistake James Cameron did in ""Titanic.""  Watch those two stars, and ignore the incredible story.
