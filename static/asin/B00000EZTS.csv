The movie was so slow that I began to compare it to a dull pencil. It was also one of the rare examples that the music was actually a lot better than the movie per se. In fact, the music was best heard while sleeping throughout the film. In fact also, from wiki, ""Super Fly is one of the few films ever to have been outgrossed by its soundtrack."" No wonder. Meanwhile, it had been stated that Stupid Fly was an important film of 70's. Oh, pray tell me...what's so important about it? It was a one huge cocaine commercial to me. And oh...the atrocious fashion being sported by the pimps...what a sad sight. At least it was responsible for starting the trend of creating ""pimpmobiles."" Hmm, interesting...not. Anyway, there was not much of a plot during Stupid Fly, and I am supposed to sympathize with Priest for his trying so damned hard to get out of cocaine dealing business? What about all of the victims and addicts? Pathetic. Good news, I actually did appreciate the rawness displayed in the picture; I was literally hoping for it to be a huge selling point but sadly not. Of all actors in the cast, I liked Carl Lee's performance. Pretty gritty. Can't say the same for everybody else; just horrible stuff. The ending was too lame to watch: all the phony moves and for nothing special. All in all, Stupid Fly was a great example of the Blaxploitation genre, but let's get real: it's the music that's the winner.

496094,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00000EZTS,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[27, 28]","Superfly (1972) is a tough, unpolished gem rising above the numerous films to come from the blaxploitation period of the early 70's.  While some are critical of the message they believe posed within the film, one of glamorizing the image of the drug dealer, I didn't really see it that way at all.  I think this image presented was a superficial one, and one that the main character within the film saw and understood, prompting his actions and decisions to try and escape the life.Ron O'Neal, who recently passed away on January 14, 2004, plays Priest, a streetwise pusher in a dilemma.  Seems he is tired of the hustle, and is looking for a way to get out of the game, but, as his partner Eddie (Carl Lee) puts it, ""Look, I know it's a rotten game, but it's the only one The Man left us to play.""  Apparently Priest has thought long about this, and he has come up with a plan to score a lot of cash in a short amount of time, and then plans to retire.  Sounds like a plan, but Priest soon encounters powerful forces that feel he is worth more to them on the streets, pushing junk, doing what he does best.  While the film does appear to glamorize the lifestyle of the drug peddler, I truly believe the underlying message was than despite all Priests' success, he was languishing in a form of slavery, always working for someone else and taking all the risks involved in such a trade.  In a way he realized this, but found it difficult to leave the life, as that was all he knew, and working for 'chump change' was not in his future.Gordon Parks, Jr. direction may seem amateurish with jerky camera shots and such, but it fit in nicely with the nature of the material within the film, giving a raw, harsh look into the seedy side of life, much like Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets (1973).  One of the things that really sets this film apart from the other movies of the time was the soundtrack by the legendary Curtis Mayfield.  With such funkified songs as Pusherman, Freddie's Dead, and Superfly, Mayfield's contributions to the film served to elevate it above many films within the genre, and solidify his career as a musical genius.  O'Neal is great as Priest (love those outta sight mutton chops), and is supported by some really decent performances by the lovely Sheila Frazier, Julius Harris, who many may recognize from the James Bond film Live and Let Die (1973), and Charles McGregor, who also appearing in Mel Brooks Blazing Saddles (1974).There are a good amount of special features on this disc including a brand new documentary called `One Last Deal:  A Retrospective', a commentary track by Dr. Todd Boyd, a USC professor of television and cinema and author of ""Am I Black Enough for You: Popular Culture from the 'Hood and Beyond"", a early featurette with Ron O'Neal, a `making of ` documentary with O'Neal, `Behind the Threads' featurette with costumer designer Nate Adams where he shows off some of the original costumes from the film, and an audio only track with Mayfield's music.  Also, I really liked some of the small touches within the interactive menu.

Curtis Mayfield was and is one of this country's greatest social, protest songwriters ever. He also had a special musical groove which connected with both Rockers and Funksters. Along with bands like War,Santana, Malo, Mardrill and Osibisa,we had one hell of a good time growing up listening to the music. In addition, we never delt in drugs, but we sure as hell dressed like the main character, Priest. However, this was also a time of racial and social unrest, and there was alot of racial gang wars going on in certain High Schools.  My friends and I grew up in an era where we were bused and integrated into High Schools located far away in different neighborhoods. These locations were not the original High Schools we should have gone to. Furthermore, being latinos, we were not about to let ourselves be pushed around by anyone, not by Whites or by African-Americans, and so as a culture or as a group, we banded together and through shear courage and audacity we earned the respect from others.

496106,AM57A1QOG6MWN,B00000EZTS,Humble Frank,"[0, 0]","I first saw this film when it was first released in those long ago cool days of the early 70's.  Of all the Black Crime dramas of the time Super Fly (only the original Shaft would have an equal effect)would have for better or worst the most influence on that generation.  I can remember many of my friends dressed in their colorful long coats, wide brim hats, with coke spoons hanging from their neck but driving Ford Mustangs instead of ""pimped out caddies pulling into the parking lot of Woodward High School.  Actually those were great days at school and at the movies where for the first time in our young lives we saw black men and women playing heroes on the screen.  Yes, when I was in High School I was a big fan of this film.  But looking back on it (after a recent viewing of it on DVD) I now have some major problems with it.As we all know, Super Fly concerns a successful coke dealer by the name of YoungBlood Priest, well played by the late Ron ONeal (in fact all of the acting is way above the production values of the film except for a small part given to an actual New City pimp credited as K.C. who loaned his own personal car to the production to serve as Priest's on screen ride.  According to one of the extra's the slick white suit worn by ONeal on the LP cover was also lent to the prodution by K.C.  The problem with K.C. is that when he speaks his lines you can barely understand him)who longs to give up the life.  Only the ""Man"" and his partner Eddie have different ideas.  Because he doesn't feel that he is capable of doing anything else (what a message to send to young viewers)and he does not want to give up the high lifestyle his illegal career provides Priest plots to dump a large amount of coke on the community and retire from the profits.  Due to events beyond his control the ""Man"" and several crooked cops take note of Priest and demand that he deal coke for them.  The rest of the film deals with Priest's attempt to remain his own man.The major problem that I now have with Super Fly is that while the screenplay talks a lot about self determination it is really about a black man who is willing to dump a lot of poison on the black community so that he can sit back and enjoy the good life.  Today, Priest is a hero, or an anti-hero who I have a hard time getting behind.  Is he any better than the ""Man"" or the crooked cops.  I can not accept the idea that it is a better situation when black men are selling drugs in the community than it is when a white man is doing it.  Either way the community is losing.One thing about Super Fly that still holds up today is Curtis Mayfield's powerful score.  Rivaling Issac Hayes' Shaft score for popularity back in the day the music keeps the amoral proceedings moving along at such an exciting pace that not even the film's low budget drive in theater look can distract.  One of the many musical highlights of the film is Mayfield's ""Pusherman"" set to still photographs of Priest's drug crew applying their trade about New York City.  NOTE:  Priest doesn't sell in just the black community as these images show many of his buyers can be found among the white community.  After all these years I still have my LP copy of the sound track.As for the DVD itself, the imagines appear to be of the same quality of the VSH tape that I first purchased many years ago.  This I don't believe is the fault of the transfer but due to the film's original drive-in look.

496108,A2RZUFRYRHTRS8,B00000EZTS,jasoneducator,"[0, 1]","I've been a fan of Superfly as soundtrack for years. Curtis Mayfield is the man, crooner, poet, and funkateer all put into one wise package. The lyrics of his songs for Superfly tell the story for me better than the plot itself at times.So in figuring out this flick in my own mind, it was hard for me to see how beyond the soundtrack it was so great. Part of this is me facing the hard facts of how low budget it was for the first time. The chase scenes go on too long for me and there's a lot of footage of guys just running around in their cars. There were some real gaps in the story for me.But ultimately I just wasn't really connecting with Priest. Yeah, he wants to get out of the game. But he's also high all the time. That's the hardest thing for me. There's a certain glamour in how he balances his women and how he flips the man's script. But he's flippin high all the time.

496109,A2TAJ7OQD1P5I8,B00000EZTS,Jenks,"[18, 18]","I was born in the 70's but it was only recently (a couple of days ago) that I saw the film Superfly.  A film about a drug dealer who wants to retire from the cocaine business because he sees its fatalism.  I guess I must have bought into the negativity of those who condemned the film for its perceived glorification of street life.  In reality,  I didn't even know what the film was about, I simply discounted it as just another blaxploitation that would be filled with over the top characters and bad acting. But Superfly was none of what I expected.  It's social commentary speaks to the hopelessness of such a life style and if anything offers an anti-drug message.  It also speaks to what society tells us to revere-money, homes, cars-the American Dream. Unfortunately, people could not see beyond the flashy clothes and the melodic musical score, which serves as the narrator, and controversy to capture the real message of the film.  It is also unfortunate that the late Ron O'Neal's mesmerizing and brilliant performance as Priest was somewhat overshadowed by the film's controversy-namely, a drug dealer as hero. Ron O'Neal was a victim of what happens to most actors who have monumental success on a film-oftentimes they are typecast and then resigned to film and television roles that are beneath their talent and ability-it happens to the best of actors and the worst.  Had he been an actor just starting out in present times, with his exotic, smoldering good looks and immense talent and intensity, he would have become world renown and Oscar nominated and perhaps an Oscar winner.  He was definitely underrated and a man ahead of his time.Although obviously low budget, Superfly IS a very good film. Curtis Mayfield's haunting soundtrack coupled with Ron O'Neal's hypnotic performance definitely makes this a must see film. And although it is included in the blaxploitation genre, Superfly is a film that deserves to stand on its own.",5,"""I know it's a rotten game, it's the only game 'The Man' left us to play""",1148774400,"05 28, 2006",2006,1948,"['was', 'born', '70', 'was', 'only', 'recently', 'couple', 'days', 'ago', 'saw', 'film', 'Superfly', 'A', 'film', 'drug', 'dealer', 'who', 'retire', 'cocaine', 'business', 'fatalism', 'guess', 'must', 'have', 'bought', 'negativity', 'who', 'condemned', 'film', 'perceived', 'glorification', 'street', 'life', 'reality', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'simply', 'discounted', 'just', 'blaxploitation', 'would', 'be', 'filled', 'top', 'characters', 'bad', 'acting', 'Superfly', 'was', 'none', 'what', 'expected', 'social', 'commentary', 'speaks', 'hopelessness', 'life', 'style', 'anything', 'anti-drug', 'message', 'also', 'what', 'society', 'revere-money', 'homes', 'cars-the', 'American', 'Dream', 'Unfortunately', 'people', 'could', 'not', 'see', 'flashy', 'clothes', 'melodic', 'musical', 'score', 'narrator', 'controversy', 'capture', 'real', 'message', 'film', 'also', 'unfortunate', 'late', 'Ron', ""O'Neal"", 'mesmerizing', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Priest', 'was', 'somewhat', 'overshadowed', 'film', 'controversy-namely', 'drug', 'dealer', 'hero', 'Ron', ""O'Neal"", 'was', 'victim', 'what', 'most', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'monumental', 'success', 'film-oftentimes', 'are', 'typecast', 'then', 'resigned', 'film', 'television', 'roles', 'are', 'talent', 'ability-it', 'happens', 'best', 'actors', 'worst', 'Had', 'been', 'actor', 'just', 'starting', 'out', 'present', 'times', 'exotic', 'smoldering', 'good', 'looks', 'immense', 'talent', 'intensity', 'would', 'have', 'become', 'world', 'renown', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'perhaps', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'was', 'definitely', 'underrated', 'man', 'ahead', 'time.Although', 'obviously', 'low', 'budget', 'Superfly', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'Curtis', 'Mayfield', 'haunting', 'soundtrack', 'coupled', 'Ron', ""O'Neal"", 'hypnotic', 'performance', 'definitely', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'included', 'blaxploitation', 'genre', 'Superfly', 'film', 'stand', 'own']",N/A
496110,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B00000EZTS,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[2, 3]","This movie is outrageous. Gordon Parks Jr.'s ""Superfly"" is interesting enough with its cliches of drug pushers, users, pimps, hos, and the dismal life in the ghetto. Good performances are given by Ron O'Neal as Priest, the drug pusher who wants to do the unthinkable -- get out of the business, and Julius Harris as Scatter, Priest's former connection to ""The Man"". After a little ""help"" from his friends Priest discovers he can only trust his woman, Georgia (Shelia Frazier). But, Priest has masterminded a way to take him and Georgia away from this life to another.A director today, for example, could never get away with making a movie like this. The movie moves along like a series of music videos, stopping periodically to insert some dialogue and characters and situations, after which it moves back into another music video. Even that sex scene in the bathtub seemed to go on forever, panning up and down and up and down and up and down the naked bodies in the tub, presumably long enough for the song to play out before we can move on to the next scene.From a technical standpoint, the film is an absolute disaster. There's a foot-chase early in the movie during which a wire of some sort falls directly in front of the camera lens not once, but twice, the audio is numerous scenes does not even remotely match the video (the never-ending bathtub scene, for example), and the acting is abysmal.Throughout the film, the enjoyment comes from Curtis Mayfield's superb soundtrack. It has a way of elevating what might be just another b film to a cult classic. From ""Little Child Runnin' Wild"" in the opening sequence to Curtis Mayfield's live performance of ""Pusherman"" in Scatter's club to the end credits with the title track, this is simply one of the finest pieces of music ever written specifically for a film. The soundtrack album, which produced hit singles with ""Freddie's Dead"" and ""Superfly"", stands with Marvin Gaye's ""What's Going On"" as perhaps the two greatest soul albums of the 1970's.",4,"""Superfly"" helps represent the era of the Seventies.",1163548800,"11 15, 2006",2006,2005,"['movie', 'outrageous', 'Gordon', 'Parks', 'Jr.', 'Superfly', 'interesting', 'enough', 'cliches', 'drug', 'pushers', 'users', 'pimps', 'hos', 'dismal', 'life', 'ghetto', 'Good', 'performances', 'are', 'given', 'Ron', ""O'Neal"", 'Priest', 'drug', 'pusher', 'who', 'do', 'unthinkable', 'get', 'business', 'Julius', 'Harris', 'Scatter', 'Priest', 'former', 'connection', 'Man', 'little', 'help', 'friends', 'Priest', 'can', 'only', 'trust', 'woman', 'Georgia', 'Shelia', 'Frazier', 'Priest', 'masterminded', 'way', 'take', 'Georgia', 'away', 'life', 'another.A', 'director', 'today', 'example', 'could', 'never', 'get', 'away', 'making', 'movie', 'movie', 'along', 'series', 'music', 'videos', 'stopping', 'periodically', 'insert', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'situations', 'back', 'music', 'video', 'Even', 'sex', 'scene', 'bathtub', 'seemed', 'go', 'forever', 'panning', 'up', 'down', 'up', 'down', 'up', 'naked', 'bodies', 'tub', 'presumably', 'long', 'enough', 'song', 'play', 'out', 'can', 'move', 'next', 'scene.From', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'film', 'absolute', 'disaster', 'foot-chase', 'early', 'movie', 'wire', 'sort', 'directly', 'front', 'camera', 'not', 'once', 'twice', 'audio', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'not', 'even', 'remotely', 'match', 'video', 'never-ending', 'bathtub', 'scene', 'example', 'acting', 'film', 'enjoyment', 'Curtis', 'Mayfield', 'superb', 'soundtrack', 'way', 'elevating', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'just', 'b', 'film', 'cult', 'classic', 'Little', 'Child', 'Runnin', 'Wild', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Curtis', 'Mayfield', 'live', 'performance', 'Pusherman', 'Scatter', 'club', 'end', 'title', 'track', 'simply', 'one', 'finest', 'pieces', 'music', 'ever', 'written', 'specifically', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'album', 'produced', 'hit', 'singles', 'Freddie', 'Dead', 'Superfly', 'Marvin', 'Gaye', 'What', 'Going', 'perhaps', 'two', 'greatest', 'soul', 'albums', '1970']",N/A

Years after watching the others, I finally get around to seeing Superfly.Superfly is about Youngblood Priest, a drug dealer and one of the baddest, most authentically black cats in all the city.  He has it good with his women, the money, his wheels, and he has the respect of the other dealers and underworld figures.  Despite all this success, Priest desperately wants to move out of the criminal life.  He figures one last score will get him out.I expected more comedy.  Perhaps seeing Ron O'Neal in that outrageous pimp suit on the DVD cover prepared me for a lighter, breezier flick.  I also expected more action.  Superfly has almost no action.  Superfly attempts a thoroughly realistic portrayal of a drug dealer surviving, thriving, and trying to snake his way out of the business.  O'Neal's performance is a job well done, and supporting players deserve credit as well.Gordon Parks Jr. directed, and while his work is not masterful, it serves the performers and setting well.Superfly deserves its reputation as a landmark blaxploitation flick, and it's surely worth 90 minutes of your time.  Just don't start the movie expecting a lot of action or comedy.  Superfly is a lowdown nasty drama about the hard life.Also, the DVD includes some extras.

Many mentioned The Mack while others bragged on Shaft and I was outnumbered until I broke Superfly down to my co-workers. This brilliant and well-acted film is not only the best of the Blaxploitation era but it's one of the greatest American films ever, in the same category with The Godfather Trilogy, The French Connection films, the first Star Wars series, and other big movies. This tale of a cocaine dealer waking up and evaluating his glamorous but miserable and dead-end lifestyle doesn't pull any punches and still is a valuable lesson for would be hustlers today. Superfly features the best love scene ever captured on film between Priest (Ron O'Neal) and Georgie (Sheila Frazier) as well as the greatest soundtrack of all time by Curtis Mayfield. The film, characters, fashions, cars, and soundtrack were blueprints for almost every other movie that followed during that era. After hitting my work buddies with this info and a few choice lines from Superfly, mainly by Scatter (Julius W. Harris) and Eddie (Carl Lee), I convinced them to give this rough diamond another look. Most of them agreed that it is truly a classic and a must have for any serious movie collector. I wish Warner Brothers would repackage it with better sound and more features but at least they finally put it back out. Now, do yourselves a favor and order Superfly immediately if it's not in your personal collection.",5,One Of The Best American Films Ever With The Greatest Soundtrack Of All Time,1271462400,"04 17, 2010",2010,1510,"['recently', 'watched', 'Superfly', 'again', 'cafeteria', 'argument', 'work', 'best', 'Blaxploitation', 'film', 'ever', 'Many', 'mentioned', 'Mack', 'others', 'bragged', 'Shaft', 'was', 'outnumbered', 'broke', 'Superfly', 'down', 'co-workers', 'brilliant', 'well-acted', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'best', 'Blaxploitation', 'era', 'one', 'greatest', 'American', 'films', 'ever', 'same', 'category', 'Godfather', 'Trilogy', 'French', 'Connection', 'films', 'first', 'Star', 'Wars', 'series', 'other', 'big', 'movies', 'tale', 'cocaine', 'dealer', 'waking', 'up', 'evaluating', 'glamorous', 'miserable', 'dead-end', 'lifestyle', ""n't"", 'pull', 'punches', 'still', 'valuable', 'lesson', 'would', 'be', 'hustlers', 'today', 'Superfly', 'best', 'love', 'scene', 'ever', 'captured', 'film', 'Priest', 'Ron', ""O'Neal"", 'Georgie', 'Sheila', 'Frazier', 'as', 'well', 'greatest', 'soundtrack', 'time', 'Curtis', 'Mayfield', 'film', 'characters', 'fashions', 'cars', 'soundtrack', 'were', 'blueprints', 'almost', 'other', 'movie', 'followed', 'era', 'hitting', 'work', 'buddies', 'info', 'few', 'choice', 'lines', 'Superfly', 'mainly', 'Scatter', 'Julius', 'W.', 'Harris', 'Eddie', 'Carl', 'Lee', 'convinced', 'give', 'rough', 'diamond', 'look', 'Most', 'agreed', 'truly', 'classic', 'must', 'have', 'serious', 'movie', 'collector', 'wish', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'would', 'repackage', 'better', 'sound', 'more', 'features', 'least', 'finally', 'put', 'back', 'out', 'Now', 'do', 'favor', 'order', 'Superfly', 'immediately', 'not', 'personal', 'collection']",N/A
