I knew it would be interesting but somehow let it slip into the recesses of my memory.Fast forward to April 2014.  I was perusing Amazon Video and saw an advertisement for season 5 of Damages.  It was a lazy Saturday, so I decided to see if the first impression I had years ago was accurate.  As the shows always start with &#34;Previously on Damages...&#34; I saw this intriguing storyline and was immediately drawn in.Now for the tough decision: This was season 5, which meant there were 4 seasons I had missed.  Do I just 'jump in' and assume details from the pre-show synopsis, or do I go all the way back to the season 1.  We know I had to make the right choice and start from the beginning!That weekend, I binge-watched all of season 1, and season 2.  I mean I only stopped for restroom breaks and food.  I turned off my phone. I closed my blinds.  I was hooked.  I repeated that scenario the following weekend with seasons 3 and 4.  I think I left the house for some groceries once.So now I was back to my entry point of episode 1 of season 5.  By that time Patty was under my skin - I she was capable of invoking any emotion she wanted to get out of me.  Season 5, and the ultimate final show were as good if not better than any other season.  The final show ending was quite appropriate too: after all is said and done, Patty Hewes does what she always does, what she lives for.

I was hugely disappointed.  And I'm stunned at all the glowing reviews.Season 5 suffered from one glaring problem.  A 2-hour story line was stretched into 10 episodes.  The rest of the time was filled with endlessly repeating dream sequences and flashbacks that added little to nothing.  Just plain boring.

I went to the writers and I said, 'The image you're leaving us with is that a woman in power is a loser - the ultimate loser,' - because Patty has all her power, but she's without intimacy, without love, without family...&#34;Part of what made the show great originally was the idea of Patti Hughes capacity to screw with peoples' perception of her as an stereotypical ice queen.  She was that cool, ambitious, female in a man's world.  As Obama campaign spokesperson, Samantha Power, famously said of Hillary Clinton in the 2008 campaign, she was a &#34;monster.&#34;But unlike the prototypical subjugated woman, Hughes was self aware about it, and in fact she got off on it.  She loved that people feared her, and used it to her advantage professionally.  The final season and episode of Damages, paints Hughes as a victim of the 'ice queen' syndrome.Not only are we to believe that the sexist stereotype against ambitious women is true, but we are to believe that Patti Hughes ultimately is the embodiment of it.  The series also reduces the complex relationship between Ellen Parsons and Hughes into a crudely imagined cat fight.Parsons prosecution of Patti which frames the season, takes the series from being a complex psychodrama and commentary on female power, to the territory of The Devil Wears Prada, the Real Housewives or Mean Girls.  Patti Hughes is the Queen Bee, and Parsons must end her reign of terror!So Season 5 of Damages largely betrays all the principles that made its thriller story lines so compelling, and Glenn Close's performance so riveting.  Hughes is reduced from a complex, almost literary character, to a crude two dimensional &#34;bitch.&#34;",2,Unfortunate Sexist Ending Taints Patti Hughes,1390262400,"01 21, 2014",2014,1793,"['ending', 'Damages', 'star', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Patti', 'Hughes', 'said', '34', 'was', 'conflicted', 'when', 'first', 'read', 'went', 'writers', 'said', 'image', ""'re"", 'leaving', 'woman', 'power', 'loser', 'ultimate', 'loser', 'Patty', 'power', 'intimacy', 'love', 'family', '34', 'Part', 'what', 'made', 'show', 'great', 'originally', 'was', 'idea', 'Patti', 'Hughes', 'capacity', 'screw', 'peoples', 'perception', 'stereotypical', 'ice', 'queen', 'was', 'cool', 'ambitious', 'female', 'man', 'world', 'Obama', 'campaign', 'spokesperson', 'Samantha', 'Power', 'famously', 'said', 'Hillary', 'Clinton', '2008', 'campaign', 'was', '34', 'monster.', '34', 'prototypical', 'subjugated', 'woman', 'Hughes', 'was', 'self', 'aware', 'fact', 'got', 'off', 'loved', 'people', 'feared', 'used', 'advantage', 'professionally', 'final', 'season', 'episode', 'Damages', 'Hughes', 'victim', ""'ice"", 'queen', 'syndrome.Not', 'only', 'are', 'believe', 'sexist', 'stereotype', 'ambitious', 'women', 'true', 'are', 'believe', 'Patti', 'Hughes', 'ultimately', 'embodiment', 'series', 'also', 'complex', 'relationship', 'Ellen', 'Parsons', 'Hughes', 'crudely', 'imagined', 'cat', 'fight.Parsons', 'prosecution', 'Patti', 'season', 'series', 'being', 'complex', 'psychodrama', 'commentary', 'female', 'power', 'territory', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'Real', 'Housewives', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'Patti', 'Hughes', 'Queen', 'Bee', 'Parsons', 'must', 'end', 'reign', 'terror', 'So', 'Season', '5', 'Damages', 'largely', 'principles', 'made', 'thriller', 'story', 'lines', 'so', 'compelling', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'performance', 'so', 'riveting', 'Hughes', 'reduced', 'complex', 'almost', 'literary', 'character', 'crude', 'two', 'dimensional', '34', 'bitch.', '34']",Damages: The Complete Fifth

They all should have ended after one or two or, in the case of LOST maybe four seasons. But human greed is such that a consensus emerges to squeeze the last tortured penny out what started as a good or great show and could have ended that way. IF it ended in time.Damages had a great first season and a so-so second season. It should have ended then but it didn't and, like all shows of its kind, it quickly descended into weirdness and extreme plot stupidity. What we could call 'great acting' on season one degenerated in the principals repeatedly 'striking the pose' in the last seasons. And the initial good scripts are now pathetic kitch-level cliches that are painful to follow.As for the last season's plot... this time the bottom-feeding scriptologists decided to exploit Assange and his Wikileaks. And the writer might as well have been working for the NSA or maybe he/she does. Hard to tell and hard to differentiate. Assange is portrayed exactly the way those super-confidential and over-secret NSA briefings describe them: irresponsible and dangerous, egocentric sex-maniac, possibly crazy, never to be trusted. All a repulsive and uninspired caricature that might have passed as North Korean propaganda. Maybe.It's all a big bore and it's crude and subtelty goes down to the level of moronic. Take this from episode two, I believe: Ellen observes Patty being friendly with the judge that presides over the case on which the two on opposide sides so Ellen does a number of clever tricks and forces the judge to recuse himself. Then... Patty calls Ellen and says ""things are never what they seem"" and then... here's the hidden camera, showing the same scenes that fooled Helen into believing that Patty and the judge were sweet but in fact the opposite was the case. No they didn't do a voice-over but it was almost like they had it. It's all like the fifth-grade level video class. Boring, stuttering and ridiculous.Alright, I didn't watch beyond episodes 2 or 3.

Breaking Bad was okay, Deadwood terrible, Dexter - meh!Anyway, this season is all about Patty & Ellen going at it. For the most part it's very entertaining, but Patty's sister plot-thread is introduced but not really capitalized on. Many have complained about Ryan Phillipe. It's not that he's the worst actor in the world, but he plays (for this show) a fairly boring character. Unlike Julian Assange, who he's based on. He's not a twisted, love him or hate him character. Also he's competing with the legend of Ted Danson, who set the bar high with Frobisher, as well as Campbell Scott, William Hurt, John Goodman, etc. So he seems a dull pretty-boy in comparison. His wingman, deputy is far more intriguing.The series leads up to a court fight that never really happens--which disappointed me. It would have been a classic free-for-all! Also, the flash-forwards to a possible ending are more interesting than what actually happens to Ellen. The Maine airport scene goes down in history as the most prolonged & boring sequence in this show's history.Spoiler Alert:After a decent ending, someone (Producer?) added an epilogue which is silly. Over the course of the series Ellen has slowly been turning into a monster who will do anything to win, like Patty Hewes, & ike the famous Frederick Nietzche quote.

She starred in Songcatchers, a wonderful film about a strong, professional woman, a music researcher, set in the early 20th century, who, having been once again turned down for tenure in her university, goes to stay with her younger sister who is teaching five miles by cart up a mountain in West Virginia. She collects folk songs from many of the inhabitants and we hear them in their most basic forms. There is great erotic chemistry between McTeer and a 'mountain man'.In Damages McTeer's role is a bit ambiguous, then sort of disappears. But I always love watching her when she is on the screen.First review: I wrote a careful review, but it disappeared. I don't feel like rewriting it. Sorry. Just unlikeable, flat, unknowable characters, full of spite and gamesmanship. I never think about this movie, these characters, after watching them. Not as I did after seeing the new British series, Broadchurch, for example. Damages is just a pasttime, until another good series makes itself available. There is nothing to learn from bleakly amoral Damages; I am left feeling vaguely dirty, unsatisfied and annoyed.Later I saw the new series Endeavor, about the young man version of Inspector Morse, how he became a detective, how he came by some of the likes and characteristics of the Morse series; but it stands alone.On second thought, if I can I'll change my Damages rating from 2 to 1.",1,Annoying.

I had enjoyed the first three seasons: interesting plots, excellent casts, and the non-linear way the stories unfolded (flashbacks and flash-forwards) kept one a little off-balance and focused. But Season 4, in my opinion, was a disaster - contrived and implausible &#8211; and I had no idea whether in Season 5 the series would return to the quality of the first three seasons or remain mired at the level of Season 4. The good news is, Season 5 is better than Season 4. The bad news is, that is faint praise.Patty Hewes (Glenn Close) has always been depicted as hard-nosed, but in Season 5 her behavior toward her son became gratuitously mean. Rose Byrne&#8217;s performance in the series never really grabbed me &#8211; she came off too wimpy to be a big-time litigator, and nothing I saw in Season 5 led me to change that opinion. In fairness to her, that largely may be due to her inevitable comparison with Close. The series has made an effort to be topical, and in Season 5 this takes the form of Channing McClaren (an indifferent Ryan Phillippe), a character inspired by Julian Assange.

1639238,A3CJN2S0XLVVLM,B00BUEUH6C,Silver Screen Videos,"[1, 2]","For five seasons, TV viewers who have followed Damages have been privileged to watch powerhouse civil attorney Patty Hewes (Glenn Close) pull every manipulative and often illegal trick in the book in taking on and usually taking down a variety of corporate fatcats and sleazeballs. Not even cancellation by the FX network could slow down the show, which was picked up for two additional seasons by DirecTV in a move that added some nudity and a good bit of profanity to the already potent dramatic mix. Finally, the show comes to an end that could have been one of TV's all time best if not for a poorly thought out epilogue.As with each of the previous seasons, Damages concentrates on one big case, usually a very timely one. This time out, Patty helps her former associate and prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Ellen Parsons (Rose Byrne), who now has her own fledgling legal practice, land a huge client, the owner (Ryan Philippe) of a Wikileaks-like whistleblower website. Patty's motives are not altruistic, since her goal is to ensure that Ellen can't testify against her in a custody case her estranged son has filed to regain custody from Patty of Patty's granddaughter.With the help of an employee (Jenna Elfman) of a major investment bank, Philippe exposes the bank's involvement in a big insider trading scandal. Unfortunately, he also exposes Elfman's personal romantic improprieties in a series of personal e-mails that were also posted on Philippe's site along with the financial hanky panky. Soon, Elfman is dead, an apparent suicide, and Patty, representing Elfman's daughter,  brings a suit against Philippe. What viewers know, but Patty, Ellen, and the authorities don't, is that Elfman was actually murdered.Most seasons of Damages have had good central mysteries, and this one is no exception. Finding out who was responsible for leaking Elfman's personal information and killing her, along with why, occupies most of the season, and the eventual revelation is somewhat surprising. However, entertaining as the mystery is, the real highlight of the season is watching Patty and Ellen slug it out as opponents in a major case. Indeed, Ellen's transformation over the show's five seasons from innocent law school grad to a younger version of Patty is fascinating to watch, and Rose Byrne is up to the task. Indeed, the entire cast (with the exception of Philippe, who makes almost no impression), which includes Janet McTeer, Victor Garber, M. Emmett Walsh, John Hannah, Judd Hirsch, and William Sadler, provides the usual high level of acting viewers have become accustomed to on this show.Still, the show has always revolved around Patty, and Close's performance this season is masterful. She faces assaults from all sides: Ellen, her estranged son, her dying father, and some skeletons in her closet from past seasons that come home to roost. Watching her strain and threaten to crack, while never being sure what she'll do next provides a testament to her acting skills.Which brings us to the actual conclusion of the show. The secrets are finally revealed, and the result is a powerful dramatic moment, albeit, in the show's usual manor, magnificently underplayed. Unfortunately, the writers were not content to exit on that fitting note. Instead, they tack on a two-minute epilogue that dilutes much of the impact of the earlier few scenes. Viewers who have followed Patty and Ellen for five seasons of turmoil will not be satisfied (and I deducted a full star from my review as a result, from 4 1/2 to 3 1/2 stars).Still, two minutes of poorly thought out exposition cannot destroy the enjoyment viewers will have in the preceding ten hours of this season or the show's entire five-season run for that manner.

Excellent writing and acting.  I don't really get why some reviewers are panning the 5th season saying Ryan Phillippe's acting was wooden.  Didn't they watch the episode about his character's son?  That episode explains his behavior quite nicely.  I like the way each season focused on a different case that mimicked what's going on in the real world, and I liked the way they kept you guessing all season long till the climactic finale.
