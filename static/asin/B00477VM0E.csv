1388161,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B00477VM0E,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[22, 26]","""The Sacred Blacksmith"" anime series makes its way to the US courtesy of FUNimation Entertainment.Based on the Japanese light novel series by Isao Miura, with original character designs by Luna, a total of nine volumes have been published by Media Factory under their MF Bunko J label (targeted towards young adult males, the J stands for juvenile).  Meanwhile a manga adaptation began its serialization in 2009 in the monthly manga magazine ""Monthly Comic Alive"" and in October 2009, a 12 episode anime series by Manglobe aired on AT-X through December.The anime series is directed by Masamitsu Hidaka (""Linebarrls of Iron"", ""I Dream of Mimi"", ""Pokemon Advance""), a screenplay adaptation by Masashi Suzuki (""Hell Girl"", ""Shuffle!"", ""Akane Maniax"") and character design by Jun Nakai (""Tokyo Majin"").""The Sacred Blacksmith"" takes place in a land that was once ravaged in the great Valbanill War.  During that time, humans sacrificed their bodies to become powerful demons in which they would turn into Demon Contracts (weapons).  These weapons have long been banned.The story begins with a 3rd generation Knight named Cecily Campbell.  She has sworn herself to protect the city from harm and corruption but one day, she sees a former Knight that looks out of it and screaming for ""salvation"".  When she goes to apprehend him, he strikes with a huge sword which breaks apart her family sword (that has been part of the Campbell generation for ages).The Knight nearly kills her but he is stopped by Luke Ainsworth, a mysterious blacksmith who easily beats the Knight with his sword and his sword easily cuts through the Knight's sword with ease.Unfortunately, Cecily's first encounter with Luke is not good as Luke criticizes her inability to fight and protect because she is weak.  As Cecily tries to find Blacksmith's to fix her sword, she quickly learns that no blacksmith has the experience to fix a broken sword but they can upgrade it.  But Cecily wants the same sword, more powerful, not a new sword.Grateful for saving her life, Cecily goes to find this Blacksmith and finds out that he and a girl named Lisa live together and that he is a blacksmith.  Seeing how powerful his sword was in battle, Cecily wants Luke to fix her sword.  But Luke is unwilling.While she leaves his home, a man in black turns a man into a demon which attacks Cecily.  Fortunately, Luke is there and Cecily sees Luke and Lisa use some sort of magic to create a sword which can be used to fight these demons in battle.This begins an interesting friendship with three and soon enough, an even more interesting friendship when she meets a Demon Sword of Wind named Aria.  Aria has been in the property of the wrong men and she sees the kind heart of Cecily.  Cecily vows to protect everyone including Aria and both agree to form a bond in which Aria will now become the sword of Cecily.But unbeknown to Cecily, many people are coming after her to gain possession of Aria.""The Sacred Blacksmith"" features the main characters:Cecily Campbell - The main protagonist.  Cecily is a 3rd generation Knight of the Campbell family.  She swore to protect the city but at the same time, she's not a great fighter and she is not a killer.  She believes in justice and protecting people.  She is often at odds with Luke but part of her likes him.  She is often praised for having big breasts.Luke Ainsworth - The mysterious and talented Blacksmith and swordsman.  Known for his blue eyes and also living with a girl named Lisa, he often comes to aid in saving Cecily's life.  During battle, he can forge a katana.  Despite he and Cecily being opposites, he accepts her.  He vows to protect Lisa for some reason.Lisa - An assistant to Luke who has elven ears and somehow has the ability to help Luke forge weapons using magic.  She cares deeply for Luke.Aria - The demon sword of the wind who can turn human.  She is a peaceful woman who seeks for a peaceful woman who cares.  Her past has been filled with murder and carnage and she dreams of having an owner like Cecily.  The two bond and become very good friends.  Whenever in battle, she turns to sword form.Other Characters:Siegfried - The unknown man of darkness who is constantly cloaked and has been attacking Cecily and Luke for some reason.VIDEO:""The Sacred Blacksmith"" is presented in widescreen.  The first thing you notice is Jun Nakai's character designs.  As he worked on ""Tokyo Majin"", you can see his influence in this anime series with how the characters are created.  For the most part, the anime series looks very good and there is more emphasis on the characters than the art backgrounds.  Also, an emphasis on colors and lighting.As for the overall anime production, for a new company that was started back in 2007 and has focused primarily on key animation, so far this company has done a pretty good job thus far (the other anime they have worked on are ""Hayate The Combat Butler"", ""Ergo Proxy"" and ""House of Five Leaves"").  But part of the reason why I enjoy the animation for ""The Sacred Blacksmith"" was its emphasis on character expressions and although the backgrounds were not super-detailed, still, the lighting and focus on character closeups helped a lot in this series, especially during the action sequences.Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Sacred Blacksmith"" comes with the following special features* Textless Opening Song: Justice of Light* Textless Closing Song: Miracle Happy Day* Trailers - FUNimation Entertainment trailers* Episode Previews - (6:24) All episode previews for ""The Sacred Blacksmith""JUDGMENT CALL:""The Sacred Blacksmith"" is an entertaining anime series that provides a good amount of action and humor.  If anything, adventure anime series fans, also those who love mystical type of storylines will enjoy this series.The characters are fun and interesting and because it focuses on four primary characters, with only 12 episodes, the series dedicates enough story to develop the characters and their friendship.  Of course, it will seem a bit derivative of other anime series in which the main female and male character are constantly bickering at each other, yet they care for one another.  A common theme in anime series and no different with ""The Sacred Blacksmith"" but the main difference is that the series focuses on a mystical blacksmith and swordfighting and demon weapons that turn human.  Definitely an interesting storyline.Although ""The Sacred Blacksmith"" looks like a safe anime adventure series, it's important to note that it does have a mature theme (thus the mature rating).Part of the running gag of the series is Cecily's breasts.  It appears that many of the women are flat-chested and thus, look at Cecily's breasts as significant.  And so there will be times where her armor breaks off and it exposes her bare front chest.  Also, with the American dub, the dialogue tends to have a more mature theme as Cecily will be seen screaming some not so bad vulgarities but with the nudity and language, definitely not a series to watch with the younger viewers.Overall, ""The Sacred Blacksmith"" is an entertaining and short anime series.  Once again, it's only 12-episodes long and doesn't require too much of your time.  For collectors, there is a special limited edition of this set being released which comes with a 32-page artbook and special box.If you are looking for a fun, action-packed anime series that doesn't require too much of your time, definitely give ""The Sacred Blacksmith"" a try!",3,"If you are looking for a fun, action-packed anime series that doesn't require too much of your time, definitely give

The scared black smith has all the right elements.Comedy,drama,pretty girls, yadda yadda. However it's not something you've seen done to death which is very nice. The story was interesting and it wasn't predictable. Feels as though just when things are really about to start the series just ENDS abruptly. I felt the same way with Birdy Season 2. I really wanted more of the show and it just got cut short. Although there was some cheesiness in the Sacred Black Smith it wasn't overshadowed by the fact that people could be killed and death was apparent in their world.Matter of fact the only one that seems in the dark about reality is the main character Cecily who hesitates to kill a man as she stands there covered in his blood ashamed of herself. I think that's when I started to enjoy the anime. The main character was more realistic in her actions. Even when she wielded a powerful sword she wasn't unbeatable. Only through the episodes do we watch her hard work and practice pay off. She also begins to learn from her experiences she sufferers and in the end it starts to make her a better fighter. Still not ""Samurai X"" over night but you see her start to fight better and try harder. I respect that the most about this anime. You really watch the main character grow. She doesn't always know what to do and often at times she is confused but she listens to her friends and takes their advice. For once the concept of character development really shows through. Although Cecily was strong willed and outspoken from the start, she still had her flaws that she needed others to help her improve.Another good thing I liked about this anime is the idea of the swords. ""SPOILER HERE"" if you don't want to know a major detail of the anime. The Demon Swords that are able to turn into people are why I feel the show needs a second season the most. Aira herself seemed like an interesting character that had a lot to tell about her past and the people that wielded her (also I would like to know why she seems to know so much about seducing men and love? When she's a sword"". Each sword that can turn human seems to be unlike the other. They really don't seem to have anything to do with one another. Even though they are so rare it's as though they don't care for one another. I wanted to know more about the Black flame sword ""Evadne"" who obviously is hiding something. I thought more would come from her encounter since she is shown standing in the opening credits alongside the main villains but nothing ever becomes of that.

1388166,A3SKWWP4FBHFS5,B00477VM0E,Matt the Samurai,"[0, 0]","As a huge anime and fantasy fan I preordered this limited edition dvd set when I first heard about it.  The story is basically that a young inexperienced knight named Cecily Cambell comes into contact with a blacksmith named Luke Ainsworth.  After she is rescued by Luke from a psychotic swordsman, she begins to pester him to make a katana for her.  They quickly become occupied by fighting mysterious monsters that begin appearing, and from here the story really picks up.  Unfortunately it's dropped off a cliff by the ending. Cecily begins as a somewhat annoying character, it doesn't help that most of the jokes in the series focus on her breasts, but ultimately you do start to care for her.  Ultimately though she doesn't accomplish anything.  The ending seems like they were hoping to get a second season to continue, but they really should've focused on making the first one something that fans would want to come back to.  However, if you don't mind the fact that the series is really open ended, or that most of the humor is really sexist/perverted, then I'd recommend it.

The three main characters all have similar backgrounds and character angst we've seen with dozen of other hero's,  you have the young naive female knight who wishes to bring honor to her dead father and family by proving her resolve and courage in battle but must overcome her own fears of inadequacy about herself and her beliefs,  than we have the young mystical blacksmith with his trusted young female demon apprentice who is more a nursemaid to him most of the times but the young blacksmith not only has the great skills of a swordsman that attracts the young female knight but has the magical ability to summon a mystical cauldron to forge profound powerful swords in battle  but as the story progresses we see the young blacksmith has his own personal agenda that intersect with the female knights goals too.  The series leaves an open end that is obviously meant to allow a possible continuation of the anime series which it hopefully does but even though the series is short it's still enjoyable with enough action, humor,  and a touch of fan service to keep us entertained.

1388171,A1KOHZ0JKRSDGY,B00477VM0E,Ron Harris,"[5, 9]","I want to be very clear when I say this anime is ok. It's very beautiful at times with the animation, and the emotion is there. I felt like the english voice for the main female character was a bit too over the top at times unfortunatly. There also wasn't too much character development outside of the the 3 main characters Luke, Lisa, and Cecily and considering this was only 12 episodes long I can see why. Even the stones that use mana were talked about very briefly, but where they come from or otherwise isn't present. That's the next problem, only 12 episodes and you only get to know fragments of the world they live in. The story is very cliched as well, the standard female character wants to protect everyone but cant without alot of support from her friends, really? I could name female protagonists off the top of my head who were more compeling then this girl, Lafiel from ""Crest of the Stars"" and Anna from ""Godannar"". You might be saying but those animes have more episodes, ok how about Haruka from ""Fooly Cooly"" and Falis from ""Murder Princess"" only 6 episodes and still much more interesting then this one.  I've seen a ton of anime in my life time and this one's only real intereting points are the demon/human swords and the blacksmith incantation swords. That's a problem when the most interesting things are the weapons. So the veterans will feel how I feel and be very nit picky with the story and presentation. If your new to anime I'd also recommend to you not to buy but rent this anime, being that there are only 12 episodes there is no way a real story could come out of this, it's easily forgettable. It is quite unfortunate that I have to say all this. If there were 26 episodes like there should have been, even then I'd probably say the same thing, since I didn't feel attached to any of the characters. I was quite excited when I saw previews of this anime from funimation, and to end in such an average manner slightly made me a bit angry, because I know the story isn't going to continue. So anyone who has Netflix, a way to rent this, or get it dirt cheap please do. It will save you the hardship of wondering if you should keep it or not.

Lots of people have complained that luke cut through another persons sword with his katana. Is it unrealistic? sure. but so are the demons and the setting and the people. lets not be so closed-minded okay? The way the official review describes this youd think it was clunky and kinda stupid. It isn't. the plot doesn't have a whole lot of time to develop (i mean come on, the whole series so far is only 12 episodes) But what you do see, in my case, wants me to come back for more. And it's not because of the fanservice, (which really isn't excessive, or even very present actually...) it is because for the first time in a long time i actually gave a crap about what happened to these people, i cared. not to mention the action is great, the dialogue (at least in japanese) is fun and entertaining or informative when it needs to be. My one complaint is that the bad guy is rather obvious. you take one look and you think ""thats him."" which kinda ruins the revealing of said bad guy. It is also necessary to point out that the reason it is so short is that the manga it is based off of is ongoing. So, where this story ends is about halfway through the existing manga.
