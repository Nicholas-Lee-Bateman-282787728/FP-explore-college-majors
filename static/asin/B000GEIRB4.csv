The short 10 minute segments offer a lot of variety so you don't get bored and you definitely hit all the muscles in your body at least once if not more. It also lets pick your workout for the day - if you only have 20 min you can just do abs and cardio or upper body and stretching. Or if you have 50 minutes you can do the whole video. And you can always intensify the workout by adding heavier weights or shifting your weight on the ball.

1002338,A309PFW8T6DMMZ,B000GEIRB4,art chick,"[3, 3]","To summarize, I would recommend this DVD.Pros:- Routines are interesting enough.- It's fun.- It's easy to just pick one workout if you don't have a lot of time.- The instructor is OK, and so is the music and the stage/set - I'm not disappointed, but not impressed either.- I got a really good shoulders work out from the upper body track.- All the routines seem to work the abs/engage the abs to some degree.Cons:- Not many cons. One con was that the instructor used the same weights for all the upper body exercises - for the shoulders I was really challenged w/ my 5lb weights, but for the biceps 5lbs was very easy. Yet the DVD doesn't give enough time for you to switch from one set of weights to another.Notes:- You need weights to do some of the exercises - in the DVD the instructor uses 2 lb weights in the DVD but says that you can work up to larger weights. I used 5 lb weights (I work out regularly and that was the correct weight for me, although I think if I keep doing this DVD I'll work up to being able to use 8 lb weights).- One other note - the instructor does some of the moves rather fast. This could frustrate someone who does not exercise regularly (for me it was fine).- Also, I'm 5'6"" and used a 75cm exercise ball, which was too big for me. I think a 65cm ball is the correct size for most women.",5,It was a fun workout,1295827200,"01 24, 2011",2011,1321,"['summarize', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD.Pros', 'Routines', 'are', 'interesting', 'enough.-', 'fun.-', 'easy', 'just', 'pick', 'one', 'workout', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'time.-', 'instructor', 'OK', 'so', 'music', 'stage/set', ""'m"", 'not', 'disappointed', 'not', 'impressed', 'either.-', 'got', 'really', 'good', 'shoulders', 'work', 'out', 'upper', 'body', 'track.-', 'routines', 'seem', 'work', 'abs/engage', 'abs', 'degree.Cons', 'Not', 'many', 'cons', 'One', 'con', 'was', 'instructor', 'used', 'same', 'weights', 'upper', 'body', 'shoulders', 'was', 'really', 'challenged', 'w/', '5lb', 'weights', 'biceps', '5lbs', 'was', 'very', 'easy', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'give', 'enough', 'time', 'switch', 'one', 'set', 'weights', 'another.Notes', 'need', 'weights', 'do', 'exercises', 'DVD', 'instructor', '2', 'lb', 'weights', 'DVD', 'can', 'work', 'up', 'larger', 'weights', 'used', '5', 'lb', 'weights', 'work', 'out', 'regularly', 'was', 'correct', 'weight', 'think', 'keep', 'doing', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'work', 'up', 'being', 'able', 'use', '8', 'lb', 'weights', '.-', 'One', 'other', 'note', 'instructor', 'moves', 'rather', 'fast', 'could', 'frustrate', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'exercise', 'regularly', 'was', 'fine', '.-', 'Also', ""'m"", '5', '6', 'used', '75cm', 'exercise', 'ball', 'was', 'too', 'big', 'think', '65cm', 'ball', 'correct', 'size', 'most', 'women']",10 Min Sol:fitness Ball Wrkout
1002339,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000GEIRB4,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[226, 229]","Fitness Ball Workouts is a sequence of five short fitness routines, each of which use a stability ball.  Because this DVD is part of the 10 Minute Solution series, each workout is only 10 minutes long, and the fully programmable feature allows you to mix and match up to six segments to create your own, completely customized routine--very nice!  None of the segments have formal warm-ups or cool-downs, but most do prepare you with a few moves in the beginning and then add some quick stretches at the end.  I've provided a brief overview for each of the five routines below:1. Lower Body.  Although this segment uses no weights, it was probably the most challenging of the five.  Kimberly begins with simple squats and side-to-side lunges, but she eventually adds in bouncing the ball and raising it overhead; combined with the high number of repetitions, you'll be really working here.  Next comes some glute work while lying face down on the ball, and finally, there is a tough hamstring portion performed lying with your feet on the ball.2. Upper Body.  This segment was probably the most disappointing, especially given that Kimberly uses such light weights (I believe she is using 3#).  She begins by warming up the upper body with push-ups (an easier version with hands on the ball) and then moves into an upper body circuit.  The circuit includes rows, tricep kickbacks, bicep curls, shoulder presses, side raises, and front raises; it is repeated three times, each time adding a few new moves such as flyes/rear flyes.  Kimberly moves quickly, which makes it difficult to vary your weights as needed (I tried to switch between 5# and 8#).3. Core.  Kimberly does warm you up here with some spinal rolls and core twists holding the ball.  She performs several sets of crunches while seated on the ball, adding a twisting move to target the obliques.  More oblique work follows while lying sideways over the ball, and then Kimberly moves to the floor for additional crunches, this time passing the ball from feet to hands.  Some brief back work follows (kneeling while leaning forward on the ball), and then Kimberly finishes with plank work (arms/hands on ball).4. Cardio.  This segment begins with squats and lunges, rolling the ball in front of you for balance.  Kimberly adds in bouncing the ball and tossing it overhead, which was kind of fun.  She then ups the intensity with some impact moves such as jacks (holding the ball overhead) and plyo squat jumps (hands on the ball).  There is a brief interval where you continue to work while seated on the ball, but then it's back on your feet for more jumps, hopping out to plank with your hands on the ball.  This segment ends with a squat and roll over the ball plus a few quick stretches.  Although this routine was fairly intense, my HR was only in my target zone for about half the workout (5 minutes).  Also, it took up quite a bit of room in my small space.5. Flexibility.  In this final segment, Kimberly leads you through a series of stretches using the ball.  There is more of a lower body emphasis, beginning with lunges/hip flexor stretches as well as some standing hamstring stretches.  There are a few upper body stretches performed seated on the ball, but for some reason, Kimberly moves very quickly through these and does not hold them for as long as the lower body stretches.Overall, although these were generally solid, well-designed routines, I didn't really enjoy this workout.  I'm not sure that the 10-minute format works well for mixing strength and cardio; an all-strength program might have been better.  However, I would recommend this video to those who like Kimberly, enjoy using the ball, and prefer to break their workouts into shorter segments; the fact that the routines are programmable is definitely a huge plus as well.",4,"DVD with five solid, programmable advanced beginner/low intermediate workouts",1156982400,"08 31, 2006",2006,3815,"['Fitness', 'Ball', 'Workouts', 'sequence', 'five', 'short', 'fitness', 'routines', 'use', 'stability', 'ball', 'DVD', 'part', '10', 'Minute', 'Solution', 'series', 'workout', 'only', '10', 'minutes', 'long', 'fully', 'programmable', 'feature', 'mix', 'match', 'up', 'six', 'segments', 'create', 'own', 'completely', 'customized', 'routine', 'very', 'nice', 'None', 'segments', 'have', 'formal', 'warm-ups', 'cool-downs', 'most', 'do', 'prepare', 'few', 'moves', 'beginning', 'then', 'add', 'quick', 'stretches', 'end', ""'ve"", 'provided', 'brief', 'overview', 'five', 'routines', 'below:1', 'Lower', 'Body', 'segment', 'weights', 'was', 'probably', 'most', 'challenging', 'five', 'simple', 'squats', 'side-to-side', 'lunges', 'eventually', 'bouncing', 'ball', 'raising', 'overhead', 'combined', 'high', 'number', 'repetitions', ""'ll"", 'be', 'really', 'working', 'here', 'Next', 'glute', 'work', 'lying', 'face', 'down', 'ball', 'finally', 'tough', 'hamstring', 'portion', 'performed', 'lying', 'feet', 'ball.2', 'Body', 'segment', 'was', 'probably', 'most', 'disappointing', 'especially', 'given', 'Kimberly', 'such', 'light', 'weights', 'believe', 'using', '3', 'warming', 'up', 'upper', 'body', 'push-ups', 'easier', 'version', 'hands', 'ball', 'then', 'upper', 'body', 'circuit', 'circuit', 'rows', 'tricep', 'kickbacks', 'bicep', 'curls', 'shoulder', 'presses', 'side', 'raises', 'front', 'raises', 'repeated', 'three', 'times', 'time', 'adding', 'few', 'new', 'moves', 'such', 'flyes/rear', 'flyes', 'Kimberly', 'quickly', 'difficult', 'vary', 'weights', 'needed', 'tried', 'switch', '5', '8', '.3', 'Core', 'Kimberly', 'warm', 'up', 'here', 'spinal', 'rolls', 'core', 'twists', 'holding', 'ball', 'several', 'sets', 'crunches', 'seated', 'ball', 'adding', 'twisting', 'move', 'target', 'obliques', 'More', 'oblique', 'work', 'lying', 'sideways', 'ball', 'then', 'Kimberly', 'floor', 'additional', 'crunches', 'time', 'passing', 'ball', 'feet', 'hands', 'brief', 'back', 'work', 'kneeling', 'leaning', 'forward', 'ball', 'then', 'Kimberly', 'finishes', 'plank', 'work', 'arms/hands', 'ball', '.4', 'Cardio', 'segment', 'squats', 'lunges', 'rolling', 'ball', 'front', 'balance', 'Kimberly', 'bouncing', 'ball', 'tossing', 'overhead', 'was', 'kind', 'fun', 'then', 'ups', 'intensity', 'impact', 'moves', 'such', 'jacks', 'holding', 'ball', 'overhead', 'plyo', 'squat', 'jumps', 'hands', 'ball', 'brief', 'interval', 'where', 'continue', 'work', 'while', 'seated', 'ball', 'then', 'back', 'feet', 'more', 'jumps', 'hopping', 'out', 'plank', 'hands', 'ball', 'segment', 'squat', 'roll', 'ball', 'few', 'quick', 'stretches', 'routine', 'was', 'fairly', 'intense', 'HR', 'was', 'only', 'target', 'zone', 'workout', '5', 'minutes', 'Also', 'took', 'up', 'quite', 'bit', 'room', 'small', 'space.5', 'Flexibility', 'final', 'segment', 'Kimberly', 'series', 'stretches', 'using', 'ball', 'more', 'lower', 'body', 'emphasis', 'beginning', 'lunges/hip', 'flexor', 'stretches', 'as', 'well', 'standing', 'hamstring', 'stretches', 'are', 'few', 'upper', 'body', 'stretches', 'performed', 'seated', 'ball', 'reason', 'Kimberly', 'very', 'quickly', 'not', 'hold', 'as', 'long', 'lower', 'body', 'stretches.Overall', 'were', 'generally', 'solid', 'well-designed', 'routines', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'workout', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', '10-minute', 'format', 'well', 'mixing', 'strength', 'cardio', 'all-strength', 'program', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'However', 'would', 'recommend', 'video', 'who', 'like', 'Kimberly', 'enjoy', 'using', 'ball', 'prefer', 'break', 'workouts', 'shorter', 'segments', 'fact', 'routines', 'are', 'programmable', 'definitely', 'huge', 'as', 'well']",10 Min Sol:fitness Ball Wrkout

The lower body section has some excellent moves for the hamstrings, we often hear about stretching them but this has some of the few moves I've seen that really strengthens them. The moves in the upper body section are very controlled so you can keep increasing your weight without losing form. The stretch program, while not superior, is very good considering that this comes from Ten Minute Solution (I've been underwhelmed by many of their stretches, check out Madeleine Lewis for some good ones.) I initially used a weighted ball (it's got sand in the bottom) which is great for people who want to move the focus from the core to the arms.

I typically do all 5 segments in one workout but what's nice about this dvd is you could customize your workout to include any number of them. This is most geared to beginners and low intermediates, however, I think is appropriate for all levels. This is not one of those workout dvds that's too easy to be worthwhile for the more advanced exerciser. I consider myself intermediate and found it somewhat challenging. The 5 segments are as follows:1) Lower Body-- There are a lot of squats and lunges in this section and quite a few repetitions. You bounce and raise the ball overhead as well which gets you really working. There's also some glute and hamstring work. This is one of the more challenging segments and good for working most of the lower body muscles.2) Upper Body-- I actually really enjoyed this section but I had to increase the weight amount from what she uses. There's a weights circuit that is repeated 3 times and each time there are slight variations on some of the exercises to keep your interest and work a little bit differently. She gets at all of the major muscles in the arms, shoulders, upper back and chest. By the third rep my muscles were fatigued.3) Core-- There are several crunches and oblique work while sitting on the ball and leaning over it on your side. She shows how to make the exercises easier or more difficult based on your level. There's some more ab work laying on the ground with your feet on the ball and finally some plank work. The exercises in and of themselves are not too difficult but I really enjoy the added challenge of balancing on the ball, which I always notice most with core work.4) Cardio-- It begins kind of slowly with squats and lunges, again with bouncing and tossing the ball. It's kind of fun but didn't do much for my heart rate. She then adds in some jumping exercises which get you working more. They're not super high impact and for many of them the ball helps with the impact so it's not too hard on your knees. She gets a lot of variety into this little 10 minute segment and in the end, it did feel like a somewhat intense cardio workout.5) Flexibility-- I was kind of disappointed in this section. There are lunges and hip flexor stretches, but they didn't feel all that different from what was done in earlier segments other than holding the positions a little longer. She also stretches your hamstrings and there are some arm/shoulder stretches while seated on the ball. I feel like you could have gotten much deeper stretches using the ball during the 10 minute time period but it's still a nice end to the workout.This is one of my favorite stability ball workout dvds. The exercises offer a decent amount of variety and a nice, attainable challenge, and the instructor Kimberly is very pleasant and gives clear instructions.

1002369,A3T2G352GLIEZZ,B000GEIRB4,"The Legend Of Megadon ""MEGAN""","[2, 2]","I really like this dvd it is easy to follow and time efficent. The first segment is the toughest which is the lower body portion. You use the ball durning squats and lunges and then the last portion is the killer. While your on the ball you do scissors and leg lifts and the last portion is bridges on the ball. Your thighs will burn. The section for arms is nice because you spend most of it sitting on the ball, you have to stabalize your abs on the ball so your working your abs and arms. The exercises include bicep curls, rows, triceps work and lateral raises. The third segment is abs. It starts with standing work to warm up your abs. Then lying on the ball you do twists and crunches. The 4th segment is cardio where you use the ball you bounce it and squat and hold it overhead as you do jumping jacks. At the end of the segment your sitting in the ball doing easier exercises. The final segment is stretching. There are a few arm and leg stretches you do not hold the stretches for very long so I suggest doing a few stretches on your own after you finish the dvd. Overall the dvd has a good flow and the instructions are good. The first segment was the hardest and the dvd gets easier as it goes along. If you really need to lose weight and tone up I suggest you repeat the first 3 segments because they are only 10 mintues.",4,My thighs are burning,1201564800,"01 29, 2008",2008,1335,"['really', 'dvd', 'easy', 'follow', 'time', 'efficent', 'first', 'segment', 'toughest', 'lower', 'body', 'portion', 'use', 'ball', 'durning', 'squats', 'lunges', 'then', 'last', 'portion', 'killer', 'ball', 'do', 'scissors', 'leg', 'lifts', 'last', 'portion', 'bridges', 'ball', 'thighs', 'will', 'burn', 'section', 'arms', 'nice', 'spend', 'most', 'sitting', 'ball', 'have', 'stabalize', 'abs', 'ball', 'so', 'working', 'abs', 'arms', 'exercises', 'include', 'bicep', 'curls', 'rows', 'triceps', 'work', 'lateral', 'raises', 'third', 'segment', 'abs', 'standing', 'work', 'warm', 'up', 'abs', 'Then', 'lying', 'ball', 'do', 'twists', 'crunches', '4th', 'segment', 'cardio', 'where', 'use', 'ball', 'bounce', 'squat', 'hold', 'overhead', 'do', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'end', 'segment', 'sitting', 'ball', 'doing', 'easier', 'exercises', 'final', 'segment', 'stretching', 'are', 'few', 'arm', 'leg', 'stretches', 'do', 'not', 'hold', 'stretches', 'very', 'long', 'so', 'suggest', 'doing', 'few', 'stretches', 'own', 'finish', 'dvd', 'dvd', 'good', 'flow', 'instructions', 'are', 'good', 'first', 'segment', 'was', 'hardest', 'dvd', 'easier', 'along', 'really', 'need', 'lose', 'weight', 'tone', 'up', 'suggest', 'repeat', 'first', '3', 'segments', 'are', 'only', '10', 'mintues']",10 Min Sol:fitness Ball Wrkout

The lower body workout is challenging with squats, lunges, and raising the ball over your head and jumping.  The Core workout focuses on crunches and working your obliques.  The flexibility workout is just that: testing our your flexibility and stretching a lot.  That would be a good cool down.  Overall, this was an ok workout, but working out with fitness balls are normally low intensity.  I consider myself healthy and active, and I normally do moderate to high intensity workouts each week.
