The feature movie was great! Ever since my nephews and nieces got it, they watch it twice a day! I would too if I could! They can now recite the lines along with the characters. So the 3-stars is for this DVD package. Frankly, the secrets of the Furious Five should just have been a DVD extra not packaged like we were getting another feature film. And the rest of the extras, while informative and even clever, was not so entertaining. Perhaps the main feature set the standard too high. Trying too hard to squeeze a few more bucks from the audience! But if you wanna know if you should get the movie (single pack/disc)? Yes! 5 stars for King Fu Panda. Hopes it wins an Oscar!
