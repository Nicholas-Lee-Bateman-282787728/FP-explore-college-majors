The first episode of Degrassi was ""Kiss Me, Steph"" which is about when Stephanie is in the 8th grade and she wants to change her appearance so she starts to wear less clothes. Her friend, Voula, thinks that the clothes she wore in 7th grade were fine and she shouldn't change. While this is going on Stephanie runs for school president and Voula helps her camagain. Stephanie wins but Voula ditches her because Stephanie becomes attached to Joey Jeramia who soons becomes her assistant. Also Stephanie's brother Arthur becomes friends with a boy named Yick and they are new to the school in 7th grade. It's a great show and that was just one episode! The show goes up to season 5 and the last episode is really good. Now the have Degrassi: The Next Generation; I'm not sure if it's good not because I don't watch it. But my children watched the first one of the Next Generation and you can see Joey, Lucy, Spike, Snake, and Caitlin reunited with eachother! It's a great show for teens and if you have some time off it's even good for adults.",5,"Degrassi Junior High, Box Set, Vol. 1",1102204800,"12 5, 2004",2004,1153,"['remember', 'watching', 'show', '1987', 'shows', 'were', 'really', 'insirational', 'really', 'got', 'point', 'out', 'first', 'episode', 'Degrassi', 'was', 'Kiss', 'Me', 'Steph', 'when', 'Stephanie', '8th', 'grade', 'change', 'appearance', 'wear', 'less', 'clothes', 'friend', 'Voula', 'clothes', 'wore', '7th', 'grade', 'were', 'fine', 'should', ""n't"", 'change', 'going', 'Stephanie', 'school', 'president', 'Voula', 'camagain', 'Stephanie', 'Voula', 'Stephanie', 'becomes', 'attached', 'Joey', 'Jeramia', 'who', 'assistant', 'Also', 'Stephanie', 'brother', 'Arthur', 'friends', 'boy', 'named', 'Yick', 'are', 'new', 'school', '7th', 'grade', 'great', 'show', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'episode', 'show', 'up', 'season', '5', 'last', 'episode', 'really', 'good', 'Now', 'have', 'Degrassi', 'Next', 'Generation', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'good', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'children', 'watched', 'first', 'one', 'Next', 'Generation', 'can', 'see', 'Joey', 'Lucy', 'Spike', 'Snake', 'Caitlin', 'reunited', 'eachother', 'great', 'show', 'teens', 'have', 'time', 'even', 'good', 'adults']",Degrassi Junior High Vol. 1 VHS

192495,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,1578071984,Dorrie Wheeler,"[3, 3]","Degrassi Junior High was one of those shows that engaged young viewers, taught useful lessons, and pleased parents and educators.  This cutting edge show from above the border covered topics like teen pregnancy (Spike), drinking, suicide, divorce, drugs, fitting in and just the everyday things that adoloscents deal with in society.  This multi volume set might seem expensive but it is the perfect investment to have as a classroom set or for an educator wishing to use this show in a program.  The DVD's are due out early in 2005, so if this is too much for you, wait for the season sets and special volume DVD's.  The creators of this show tried to keep it going with Degrassi High and Degrassi the next generation but nothing was as raw and relavent as the original Degrassi Junior High, and the acting by the young people, especially the young character Shane who has to deal with being a young father and the serious results of an accident, showed the teen actors really knew how to get down!",5,A Great Show and Worthy Investment,1100995200,"11 21, 2004",2004,999,"['Degrassi', 'Junior', 'High', 'was', 'one', 'shows', 'engaged', 'young', 'viewers', 'taught', 'useful', 'lessons', 'pleased', 'parents', 'educators', 'cutting', 'edge', 'show', 'border', 'covered', 'topics', 'teen', 'pregnancy', 'Spike', 'drinking', 'suicide', 'divorce', 'drugs', 'fitting', 'just', 'everyday', 'things', 'adoloscents', 'deal', 'society', 'multi', 'volume', 'set', 'might', 'seem', 'expensive', 'perfect', 'investment', 'have', 'classroom', 'set', 'educator', 'wishing', 'use', 'show', 'program', 'DVD', 'are', 'due', 'out', 'early', '2005', 'so', 'too', 'much', 'wait', 'season', 'sets', 'special', 'volume', 'DVD', 'creators', 'show', 'tried', 'keep', 'going', 'Degrassi', 'High', 'Degrassi', 'next', 'generation', 'nothing', 'was', 'raw', 'relavent', 'original', 'Degrassi', 'Junior', 'High', 'acting', 'young', 'people', 'especially', 'young', 'character', 'Shane', 'who', 'deal', 'being', 'young', 'father', 'serious', 'results', 'accident', 'showed', 'teen', 'actors', 'really', 'knew', 'how', 'get', 'down']",Degrassi Junior High Vol. 1 VHS

Unfortunately, the cast members (not to mention pathetic student/teacher affairs) are too  pretty for anyone to take the show seriously.  Degrassi Junior High was a  show that told the truth.  All the characters were different but none were  perfect.  This show was shocking, funny, emotional, all without gorgeous  stars.
