Conrad Guest""","[5, 5]","I hadn't seen Winning for maybe 25 years, so when I saw that it was available on VHS I thought it would be worth the $9.98. I recalled the premise of the movie - a racecar driver trying to find the balance between career and wife and son - but few of the details, but I remembered that I enjoyed it immensely.Newman paired with Woodward, and Richard Thomas pre-John Boy! A tight script about marital infidelity coupled with fine directing and acting, mix in some grand cinematography at the old brickyard (shot during the actual race in 1968), and a fine Dave Grusin soundtrack, and the product is a real winner!Where infidelity is concerned, we are often quick to blame one partner or the other. But if we are honest, we must ultimately see that both partners can be at fault. Winning shows that so often one partner can be responsible and the other to blame.A thought-provoking movie, despite a glaring technical flaw - Newman carrying the Borg Warner trophy around like a bowling trophy (any racing fan would know the Borg Warner trophy weighs nearly 100 pounds; the winner actually gets a replica that stands about 14 inches tall and weighs about five pounds) - director James Goldstone gets the most not only from his actors, but also from the backdrop of the movie: the 1968 Indy 500. The excitement and pageantry of the ""greatest spectacle in racing"" are expertly captured. These finely tuned machines from the ""golden era"" of racing are shown gracefully circling the track, like a skater delicately balanced on a single skate blade. Even the wrecks, shown in agonizing slow motion, have a certain beauty about them, while one of Newman's pit stops manages to stylistically contrast sitting still while his car is being serviced with the exhilaration of being on the track and at speed.For fans of Newman and Woodward and racing buffs alike, Winning is a winner.

One of the last things Newman did was take a drive around his home race track in New England just days before he passed away. Of course his co-star in the movie was his wife of many years, Joanne Woodward.As far as a movie, it is a pretty good example of the time and not that bad a race movie in that it actually has a plot other than going from one race to another. There is some hanky panky going on off the track that makes the movie interesting to those not fully into racing.The race scenes are not bad, although the on-track announcing is borderline funny at times...but not as bad as ""Redline 7000"" of about the same vintage which starred James Caan. That movie was more a kitsch drive-in movie, although fun in its own way.For race buffs there are better movies, the best being ""Grand Prix"" with James Garner and in the mix ""Le Mans"" with Steve McQueen, with a weaker story line than both ""Grand Prix"" and even ""Winning"".",4,Paul's Introduction to Racing,1244505600,"06 9, 2009",2009,1084,"['was', 'generally', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'introduction', 'racing', 'was', 'side', 'career', 'several', 'decades', 'did', 'not', 'end', 'shortly', 'died', 'One', 'last', 'things', 'Newman', 'did', 'was', 'take', 'drive', 'home', 'race', 'track', 'New', 'England', 'just', 'days', 'passed', 'away', 'course', 'co-star', 'movie', 'was', 'wife', 'many', 'years', 'Joanne', 'Woodward.As', 'far', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'example', 'time', 'not', 'bad', 'race', 'movie', 'actually', 'plot', 'other', 'going', 'one', 'race', 'hanky', 'panky', 'going', 'track', 'movie', 'interesting', 'not', 'fully', 'racing.The', 'race', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'on-track', 'announcing', 'borderline', 'funny', 'times', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'Redline', '7000', 'same', 'vintage', 'starred', 'James', 'Caan', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'kitsch', 'drive-in', 'movie', 'fun', 'own', 'way.For', 'race', 'are', 'better', 'movies', 'best', 'being', 'Grand', 'Prix', 'James', 'Garner', 'mix', 'Le', 'Mans', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'weaker', 'story', 'line', 'Grand', 'Prix', 'even', 'Winning']",N/A

64369,A3IB5WCHJVJA4N,078323211X,"MF Regan ""Seth""","[10, 11]","I picked this one up recently. I hadn't seen it since it was released. It was a very quiet film that came and went quickly. Set behind the backdrop of car racing- it may have sent mixed signals about what audience it was trying to reach.This is a character study piece- a story about a racer who doesn't have a personal life because of that life, and about a single mother with a teenaged son, who goes to work and comes home each night.They meet after Newman has run and won a race in town- and after he stumbles across her after a party, just as she is closing her rent a car outlet for the night.What follows is a very quiet, easy going courtship that spends its screen time building slowly and beautifully. We, as the audience, are allowed to see the occasional scar and barrier revealed and dropped with these characters. Newman and Woodward are really the only acting couple I've ever watched, who pull magic off 'on screen'. I think it's the reason why most try once or don't try at all. This film captured something very difficult to portray: honesty and finding a way through the hurtles. Perhaps they were tipping some of us off on how to do it- and showing why they've lasted so long together as a couple.The racing, via Goldstone's direction, is done almost as visual poetry in the background. It's done in such a way as to never overpower the story of this family coming together. Terrifically handled. Dave Gruisin's score also sets the tone during both the racing sequences, and the emotional moments.Richard Thomas is amazing as Charlie, the teenager. Watching him reach out to bond to Newman as a stepfather is nothing short of special. Father's and son's will love this because that's the way it should be- it's the kind of bond and loyalty that should form. And mothers will smile.Robert Wagner is also terrific in what is really the toughest part of this film. His friendship/rivalry is portrayed with depth and he delivers in spades. Normally these roles are delivered, black and white. Wagner shows us levels with a character's pain and honesty that's realized a little too late.Newman and Woodward have it all to play, here. The high and the low and they carry it off with a grace and ease. They also have an ending that's 'real'. It's up to them... and to us as the audience.This is one for couples to watch and to learn from.

Their first film together since ""A New Kind of Love,"" it's their best since ""The Long Hot Summer."" They exude a naturalness, intimacy and spontaneous affection that one suspects come from their own feelings for each other... It is apparent in their first scene, where he is slight1y drunk, delightfully playful, and confident (but no longer unpleasant) in his attempt to pick her up; and she responds with smiles and applause at his tricks with a fireman's hat, but looks slight1y uncertain about this glamorous stranger...Following their wedding, they sit on a swing, drinking beer from cans, talking and laughing quietly... She describes her previous loneliness, and he responds, typically, ""Beer's a lot less complicated."" They smile, she rubs his back and leans her head on his shoulder: these are people who really know each other, and who have attained a maturity about themselves...Newman exhibits this maturity throughout...

Perhaps because of the confidence gained from his directing experience, he has gotten rid of his mannerisms; and except for the intense determination he shows while racing, he's more relaxed than ever before... Although the script tells little about his past, there's a wealth of experience etched into his face, especially in his brilliant, silent reaction to finding the couple in bed--one of quiet resignation that suggests a lifetime of pain and frustration...Newman has many fine scenes of quiet underplaying: his camaraderie with Wagner early in the film; his solitude after the race; his genuine warmth in the relationship with his stepson (Richard Thomas). The scenes in which they drink champagne and come home drunk together project for the first time in Newman's career a really paternal feeling--only vaguely suggested in strikingly similar scenes in ""Hud.""",3,"""Winning"" is really Newman's picture all the way...",1168905600,"01 16, 2007",2007,2540,"['Newman', 'successful', 'driver', 'who', 'small-town', 'divorc', 'eacute', 'Joanne', 'Woodward', 'soon', ""'ve"", 'met', 'usual', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'career', 'ignores', 'everything', 'else', 'Terrace', 'Woodward', 'desperation', 'man', 'here', 'rival', 'driver', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'Newman', 'bed', 'becomes', 'estranged', 'again', 'Terrace', 'winning', 'big', 'race', 'life', 'empty', 'reconciliation', 'theme', 'winner', 'who', 'really', 'loser', '.The', 'relationship', 'superficially', 'written', 'Newman', 'Woodward', 'make', 'care', 'first', 'film', 'together', 'A', 'New', 'Kind', 'Love', 'best', 'Long', 'Hot', 'Summer', 'exude', 'naturalness', 'intimacy', 'spontaneous', 'affection', 'one', 'come', 'own', 'feelings', 'other', 'apparent', 'first', 'scene', 'where', 'slight1y', 'drunk', 'delightfully', 'playful', 'confident', 'longer', 'unpleasant', 'attempt', 'pick', 'up', 'smiles', 'applause', 'tricks', 'fireman', 'hat', 'slight1y', 'uncertain', 'glamorous', 'stranger', 'Following', 'wedding', 'sit', 'swing', 'drinking', 'beer', 'cans', 'talking', 'laughing', 'quietly', 'previous', 'loneliness', 'typically', 'Beer', 'lot', 'less', 'complicated', 'smile', 'rubs', 'back', 'head', 'shoulder', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'know', 'other', 'who', 'have', 'attained', 'maturity', 'Newman', 'maturity', 'loose', 'casual', 'style', 'evident', 'Cool', 'Hand', 'Luke', 'given', 'way', 'almost', 'complete', 'mellowness', 'Perhaps', 'confidence', 'gained', 'directing', 'experience', 'gotten', 'rid', 'mannerisms', 'intense', 'determination', 'racing', 'more', 'relaxed', 'ever', 'script', 'little', 'past', 'wealth', 'experience', 'etched', 'face', 'especially', 'brilliant', 'silent', 'reaction', 'finding', 'couple', 'bed', 'one', 'quiet', 'resignation', 'lifetime', 'pain', 'frustration', 'Newman', 'many', 'fine', 'scenes', 'quiet', 'underplaying', 'camaraderie', 'Wagner', 'early', 'film', 'solitude', 'race', 'genuine', 'warmth', 'relationship', 'stepson', 'Richard', 'Thomas', 'scenes', 'drink', 'champagne', 'come', 'home', 'drunk', 'together', 'project', 'first', 'time', 'Newman', 'career', 'really', 'paternal', 'feeling', 'only', 'vaguely', 'suggested', 'strikingly', 'similar', 'scenes', 'Hud']",N/A

(Check out the wreck that happens just about a minute after the great race begins: it's one of the most frightening things ever captured in cinema. I don't know if this wreck was staged or just happened to be captured on film.)Great to see Richard Thomas in an early role as a troubled but likable teenager. And here's to Robert Wagner, Newman's arch rival on the track and in the bedroom, who's a villain you almost have to love!Good work all around.

It is more the script that is the problem, and the movie lacks crucial time in the beginning to develop the characters and their relationships. Robert Wagner is a weak link in this movie since he never establishes himself as the friend and rival of the Newman character Frank Capua, and the whole delivery of his part in the affair with Capua's wife is weak. Where &quot;Le Mans&quot; does very much with little words, this movie sometimes fails to establish the relationship drama in key scenes, yet is very touching at times.The track drama on the other hand is captured flawlessly, and the viewer gets some very interesting impressions on how the Indy 500 were run in the late 60ies, just before the hayday of the snakepit.

The opening scenes are original for 1969, beginning with a close-up of a buttery yellow dandelion, moving through clips of families and racing fans gathering together. Of note are clips at the Indianapolis race track - a scene of a misty morning at the track the day of the Indy 500, scenes of fans entering the park, race car drivers and mechanics in tense preparations, increasing adrenalin, burgeoning crowds.
