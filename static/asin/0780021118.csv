25365,A2TLEB18074L4S,0780021118,Alexander Leach,"[4, 6]","This was the second film by Ingmar Bergman that I have seen, the first was The Seventh Seal.  I preferred this film by far and it is more typical of his work as a writer/director.  I would thoroughly recommend it as an introduction to Bergman.The performances are uniformly excellent, with Ingrid Bergman (no relation) outstanding as Charlotte, the dysfunctional concert pianist and mother of Liv Ullmann's character.After the death of her lover (briefly but beautifully handled in flashback) Charlotte visits her daughter Eva, whom she has not seen for seven years.  During the night the pair lay to rest the ghosts of their relationship while Eva was growing up.The script is excellent, with many memorable scenes.  My favourite brief sequence is when Ingrid Bergman describes how one of her conductor collaborators reminisced about one of her earlier piano concerto performances in the 1930s.  That passage is beautifully written and movingly acted.  Many other parts of the script remain in the mind after the film has ended.As the confrontation reaches its climax the performances become more uncomfortable to watch, as if one is intruding on a family dispute, but that is a tribute to the quality of the performances of Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullmann.Criterion's DVD is non-anamorphic, but the 1.66:1 image is very fine, in places excellent for a film made in 1978.A few brief flecks appear occasionally, and there is a slight touch of grain during the brief outdoor sequence when Charlotte arrives at Eva's house, but the warmth of Sven Nykvist's cinematography comes across marvellously.  The soundtrack (which is of course speech-driven) is fine.  There is also an excellent commentary by Bergman expert Peter Cowie.The subtitles are very good, and I would stick with them alongside the Swedish language soundtrack, rather than opt for the dubbed English soundtrack.",4,An emotionally draining but rewarding film.,984700800,"03 16, 2001",2001,1875,"['was', 'second', 'film', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'have', 'seen', 'first', 'was', 'Seventh', 'Seal', 'preferred', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'typical', 'work', 'writer/director', 'would', 'thoroughly', 'recommend', 'introduction', 'Bergman.The', 'performances', 'are', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'relation', 'outstanding', 'Charlotte', 'dysfunctional', 'concert', 'pianist', 'mother', 'Liv', 'Ullmann', 'character.After', 'death', 'lover', 'briefly', 'beautifully', 'handled', 'flashback', 'Charlotte', 'daughter', 'Eva', 'whom', 'not', 'seen', 'seven', 'years', 'night', 'pair', 'lay', 'rest', 'ghosts', 'relationship', 'Eva', 'was', 'growing', 'up.The', 'script', 'excellent', 'many', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'favourite', 'brief', 'sequence', 'when', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'how', 'one', 'conductor', 'collaborators', 'reminisced', 'one', 'earlier', 'piano', 'concerto', 'performances', '1930s', 'passage', 'beautifully', 'written', 'movingly', 'acted', 'Many', 'other', 'parts', 'script', 'remain', 'mind', 'film', 'ended.As', 'confrontation', 'climax', 'performances', 'become', 'more', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'one', 'intruding', 'family', 'dispute', 'tribute', 'quality', 'performances', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'Liv', 'Ullmann.Criterion', 'DVD', 'non-anamorphic', '1.66:1', 'image', 'very', 'fine', 'places', 'excellent', 'film', 'made', '1978.A', 'few', 'brief', 'flecks', 'appear', 'occasionally', 'slight', 'touch', 'grain', 'brief', 'outdoor', 'sequence', 'when', 'Charlotte', 'Eva', 'house', 'warmth', 'Sven', 'Nykvist', 'cinematography', 'marvellously', 'soundtrack', 'course', 'speech-driven', 'fine', 'also', 'excellent', 'commentary', 'Bergman', 'expert', 'Peter', 'Cowie.The', 'subtitles', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'would', 'stick', 'alongside', 'Swedish', 'language', 'soundtrack', 'rather', 'opt', 'dubbed', 'English', 'soundtrack']",N/A
25366,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,0780021118,Alex Udvary,"[6, 13]","&quot;Autumn Sonata&quot;, from what I know about Bergman, is one of the few films he's made that he dislikes. Though, I have heard he did have some qualm with &quot;Shame&quot; as well. Bergman feels he made &quot;Autumn Sonata&quot; completely wrong. He originally had a more poetic concept for the film, in the line of &quot;Persona&quot;. But, he adbandoned this idea and made it into a more realistic account, which he nows regrets. He wanted to build the film in the same structure as a sonata, with the changing moods of that kind of a musical piece. That sounds like the Bergman I know! It sounds like a much better idea than what he did come up with. Bergman to me writes beautiful dialogue. I think his films are full of passion, some may disagree and say his films are &quot;bleak&quot; and &quot;hopeless&quot;. True, there are these elements in his films, but, thats where the passion come froms. If you were to examine a little deeper into his films, they do try to provide a strong positive message. &quot;Autumn Sonata&quot; lacks the passion his other films such as &quot;Wild Strawberries&quot;, &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;, &amp; &quot;Scenes From A Marriage&quot; have. I didn't connect with the characters. They remain cold and distant. This was not Bergman's intention.Movies about families and how they struggle to keep together are among my favorite movies. Parents and childern rarely see eye to eye. Childern sometimes remember their childhood differently. Sometimes they remember things being better than what they actually were. Or maybe they remember things worst then what they were. Parents have a tendency to do the same thing also. &quot;Autumn Sonata&quot; from my view, is about what happens when you bring these things out into the open. Of course it will change your relationship with your parent or parents, but how? For better or worst? This sounds like it has Bergman written all over it. In the first few scenes I did enjoy what I saw. But, then the film slows down. Yes, the acting in this movie is wonderful, as is the cinematography by Sven Nykvist, and the choice of music is pleasureable as well. But, there just isn't any passion. There is one great scene that hits the level of intensity I wanted to entire film to achieve. The scene late at night when Eva (Liv Ullmann) and Charlotte, her mother (Ingrid Bergman) are sitting in the kitchen and for the first time they discuss Eva's youth. Here is where everything comes forward! We can see the passion the rest of the film does not have. We are caught up in this moment. The performances in that scene are so strong and believeable we forget we are watching a movie. That is without any doubt in my mind the strongest scene in this entire movie. I wish I could say I liked this film. As I am a fan of Bergman's work. Some of his films I feel are among the greatest ever made, but, &quot;Autumn Sonata&quot; is a lesser attempt by a genius.Gunnar Bjornstrand has a small cameo in this film. He was in Bergman's &quot;Dreams&quot;, yet again another brief role.

There is, indeed, such a thing as poor parenting.

25368,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0780021118,Andrew Ellington,"[7, 7]","Ingmar Bergman is one of the greatest (maybe, arguably, THE greatest) directors of all time.  Ingrid Bergman (no relation) is one of the greatest (possibly, arguably, THE greatest) actresses of all time.  For one of them, `Hostsonaten' marks their greatest cinematic achievement.  For the other, it marks a very nice contribution to a long list of cinematic achievements.I'll give you a hint, Ingrid is H-E-A-V-E-N-S-E-N-T here.`Hostsonaten' is a beautifully tragic tale of family and the way we can shield ourselves from responsibility so much so that we ultimately believe we have none.  Charlotte is a famed concert pianist who has segregated herself from her daughters for seven years.  When her eldest, Eva, invites her to come spend some time with her and her husband, Charlotte is hesitant, but she ultimately welcomes the invitation, only to be forced to face her insecurities as a mother when Eva unveils a secret.  Charlotte's youngest daughter, the tragically ill Helena, is living with Eva.  Taking place over the course of one night, Charlotte and Eva basically carry on one VERY IMPORTANT conversation that shapes the way they view each other and themselves.Before I get to the acting, I want to talk a little bit about the character of Charlotte.Charlotte Andergast is a marvel to digest, because you cannot help but sympathize with her while simultaneously getting repulsed by her.  She has all but abandoned her children and (as we learn) her husband for her own selfish pursuits, but as she is brought face to face with her actions it is obvious that she never really understood what she was doing.  Her final decision is further proof that she is not ready to fully comprehend her emotional state and the effect that it has on those around her.  She is a conundrum, but a flawlessly natural one.She is natural because Bergman makes her that way.  Ingrid is hands-down one of the greatest actresses to ever grace the screen.  This is her finest hour.  With a perfect grasp of her director's vision (Ingmar has such a way with words, painting his scenes like poetry, and Ingrid beautifully speaks every line) and a stunning array of emotional daggers, Ingrid weaves her character's tale for us in a way that allows us into her mind and makes us a part of her development.  There are so many `moments' here that I wish I could capture, but words cannot do them justice.  The subtle yet profound way that Ingrid shakes her eyes (yes SHAKES them) while watching her daughter stumble through Chopin, the neurotic way she babbles to herself while contemplating her situation, the grand `performance' she puts on for the sickly Helena, the way she completely absorbs ever word Eva speaks and slowly crumbles; all of them are just unbelievably sincere.I've mentioned before the power of Bergman's close-up (her face is just undeniably powerful) and Ingmar uses that face to perfection here.  Her final close-up, when reading Eva's letter, reminds me much of the final moments in `Goodbye, Again', where she realizes her character's encroaching fate.And yet, to single out Bergman almost seems unfair when she is matched every step of the way by Liv Ullmann.  In fact, this is the only year where I consider a tie in any category, and that is because these two actresses are just perfect compliments to one another.  Ullmann is flawless here as Eva, stripping her character's emotionally stunted layers bit by bit in order to build for us a gradual reveal.  Her big explosion when confronting her mother about a particularly painful life changing decision she went through at eighteen is just jaw-dropping in texture.  Despite the screams (it is a very loud and showy scene) there is a restraint that conveys a feeling of purity that transcends the baity aspect of the performance.It doesn't feel showy, it feels natural.With a beautifully controlled feel (the film carries a warm autumn feeling, with rich colors and textures that overlap beautifully) that embellishes upon Ingmar Bergman's directorial touch, `Hostsonaten' is not his best film, but then again, his worst would be better than most other's best.  This is a theme that he has explored many times before, but with the powerhouse coupling of Bergman and Ullmann, he has elevated his themes and given them new life.Inhale all of this.",5,This film sings a song all too honest...,1260489600,"12 11, 2009",2009,4306,"['Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'one', 'greatest', 'maybe', 'arguably', 'THE', 'greatest', 'directors', 'time', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'relation', 'one', 'greatest', 'possibly', 'arguably', 'THE', 'greatest', 'actresses', 'time', 'one', 'Hostsonaten', 'marks', 'greatest', 'cinematic', 'achievement', 'other', 'very', 'nice', 'contribution', 'long', 'list', 'cinematic', 'achievements.I', ""'ll"", 'give', 'hint', 'Ingrid', 'H-E-A-V-E-N-S-E-N-T', 'here.', 'Hostsonaten', 'beautifully', 'tragic', 'tale', 'family', 'way', 'can', 'shield', 'responsibility', 'so', 'much', 'ultimately', 'believe', 'have', 'none', 'Charlotte', 'famed', 'concert', 'pianist', 'who', 'segregated', 'daughters', 'seven', 'years', 'When', 'eldest', 'Eva', 'come', 'spend', 'time', 'husband', 'Charlotte', 'hesitant', 'ultimately', 'invitation', 'only', 'be', 'forced', 'face', 'insecurities', 'mother', 'when', 'Eva', 'secret', 'Charlotte', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'tragically', 'ill', 'Helena', 'living', 'Eva', 'Taking', 'place', 'course', 'one', 'night', 'Charlotte', 'Eva', 'basically', 'carry', 'one', 'VERY', 'IMPORTANT', 'conversation', 'way', 'view', 'other', 'themselves.Before', 'get', 'acting', 'want', 'talk', 'little', 'bit', 'character', 'Charlotte.Charlotte', 'Andergast', 'marvel', 'digest', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'sympathize', 'simultaneously', 'getting', 'repulsed', 'abandoned', 'children', 'learn', 'husband', 'own', 'selfish', 'pursuits', 'brought', 'face', 'face', 'actions', 'obvious', 'never', 'really', 'understood', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'final', 'decision', 'further', 'proof', 'not', 'ready', 'fully', 'comprehend', 'emotional', 'state', 'effect', 'conundrum', 'flawlessly', 'natural', 'one.She', 'natural', 'Bergman', 'way', 'Ingrid', 'hands-down', 'one', 'greatest', 'actresses', 'ever', 'grace', 'screen', 'finest', 'hour', 'perfect', 'grasp', 'director', 'vision', 'Ingmar', 'way', 'words', 'painting', 'scenes', 'poetry', 'Ingrid', 'beautifully', 'line', 'stunning', 'array', 'emotional', 'daggers', 'Ingrid', 'character', 'tale', 'way', 'mind', 'part', 'development', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'moments', 'here', 'wish', 'could', 'capture', 'words', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'subtle', 'yet', 'profound', 'way', 'Ingrid', 'eyes', 'yes', 'SHAKES', 'watching', 'daughter', 'stumble', 'Chopin', 'neurotic', 'way', 'herself', 'contemplating', 'situation', 'grand', 'performance', 'sickly', 'Helena', 'way', 'completely', 'absorbs', 'ever', 'word', 'Eva', 'speaks', 'slowly', 'crumbles', 'are', 'just', 'unbelievably', 'sincere.I', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'power', 'Bergman', 'close-up', 'face', 'just', 'undeniably', 'powerful', 'Ingmar', 'face', 'perfection', 'here', 'final', 'close-up', 'when', 'reading', 'Eva', 'letter', 'much', 'final', 'moments', 'Goodbye', 'Again', 'where', 'character', 'encroaching', 'fate.And', 'yet', 'single', 'out', 'Bergman', 'almost', 'unfair', 'when', 'matched', 'step', 'way', 'Liv', 'Ullmann', 'fact', 'only', 'year', 'where', 'consider', 'tie', 'category', 'two', 'actresses', 'are', 'just', 'perfect', 'compliments', 'one', 'Ullmann', 'flawless', 'here', 'Eva', 'stripping', 'character', 'emotionally', 'stunted', 'layers', 'bit', 'bit', 'order', 'build', 'gradual', 'reveal', 'big', 'explosion', 'when', 'confronting', 'mother', 'particularly', 'painful', 'life', 'changing', 'decision', 'went', 'eighteen', 'just', 'jaw-dropping', 'texture', 'screams', 'very', 'loud', 'showy', 'scene', 'restraint', 'feeling', 'purity', 'baity', 'aspect', 'performance.It', ""n't"", 'feel', 'showy', 'beautifully', 'controlled', 'feel', 'film', 'warm', 'autumn', 'feeling', 'rich', 'colors', 'textures', 'overlap', 'beautifully', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'directorial', 'touch', 'Hostsonaten', 'not', 'best', 'film', 'then', 'again', 'worst', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'most', 'other', 'best', 'theme', 'explored', 'many', 'times', 'powerhouse', 'coupling', 'Bergman', 'Ullmann', 'elevated', 'themes', 'given', 'new', 'life.Inhale']",N/A

It probably isn't one of my favourite Ingmar Bergman films, but it is still fantastic.The transfer is also amazing. Great restoration job. I noticed no scratches, or any visible damage to the print. The audio was clear & the subtitles easy to read. Special features include an interesting & insightful introduction by Ingmar Bergman, a new interview with Liv Ullman, which I also enjoyed, & a three hour making of documentary.

25375,A5LNIF5QPQ0G6,0780021118,Brian A. Gross,"[22, 24]","Beginning with The Seventh Seal, I have been enamored with the austere and intellectual world of Ingmar Bergman.  His cinema is so literate and engaging, without being boring or preachy or devolving into baseless  abstraction.  Recently I was able to see his 1978 film, Autumn Sonata, with  Liv Ullmann and Ingrid Bergman and was touched by its emotional  power.Starting with an introductory monologue by Viktor, the pastor of  the area and husband of Eva, it sets the tone of the piece and explains  Eva's feelings of lovelessness and distance.  After hearing of the death of  her mother's lover, Eva invites her mother Charlotte to visit, and after a  seven-year hiatus, the old professional pianist acquiesces.  Eva's feelings  towards Charlotte are very complex and we seem them unfold throughout the  film, the layers peeling away, eventually, on both sides.Charlotte's  arrival shows a sophisticated and worldly older woman who is demanding and  easily overshadowing of her quiet daughter.  Quickly upstaging the  situation, Charlotte breathlessly tells Eva the tale of Leonardo's slow  death and her bedside vigil, suddenly changing gears when she hears her  other daughter, Helena, is staying with Eva at the parsonage, and has been  for several years.  Charlotte's face shows her shock clearly enough and  would not have made the visit had she known.  When she sees Lena's  deteriorated condition, spastic and only able to be understood by Eva, she  still maintains control of the situation, though we know she is internally  at odds with her outward features.It is apparent Eva still longs, like a  child, for the approval of her mother.  When she describes the feelings she  has after the death of her son, Erik, her mother listens politely and  doesn't attempt to touch on the real emotions there.  She stands in the  glare of her own emotional spotlight and cannot shake the egoism that  always surrounds her.  The death of Erik created departures of different  levels for his parents - one the one side, Viktor's life ""grayed again,""  but Eva's feelings for Erik were left uncorroded.  She thinks of heaven as  ""a world of liberated feelings"" and one night of insomnia with her mother  brings about the chance to share her true feelings with her.Eva recounts  to her mother all the missed time from her adolescence; when Charlotte was  abroad entertaining foreign crowds and indulging her own selfish appetites.  Eva's wine bibbing loosens her tongue and it turns into a raw and  emotional exchange.  During this time, they depart from their  mother/daughter roles and deal with the other - for the first time - as  equals in adulthood.  In her lengthy and beautiful soliloquy, Eva states  ""you had the charge of all the words in our home.""  A grand way to put it,  and Bergman's great success in the writing of these difficult scenes is the  lack of sentimentality and the balanced pathos.  The scenes are emoted  wonderfully by the two actors and captured beautifully by long-time Bergman  cinematographer, Sven Nykvist.  The film crescendos at this point and is  heading for a recapitulation of all the elements, which marks a musical  sonata.  Autumn Sonata is a great film in the Bergman corpus and not to be  missed.",5,Another Bergman classic,955929600,"04 17, 2000",2000,3236,"['Beginning', 'Seventh', 'Seal', 'have', 'been', 'enamored', 'austere', 'intellectual', 'world', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'cinema', 'so', 'literate', 'engaging', 'being', 'boring', 'preachy', 'devolving', 'baseless', 'abstraction', 'Recently', 'was', 'able', 'see', '1978', 'film', 'Autumn', 'Sonata', 'Liv', 'Ullmann', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'was', 'touched', 'emotional', 'power.Starting', 'introductory', 'monologue', 'Viktor', 'pastor', 'area', 'husband', 'Eva', 'tone', 'piece', 'Eva', 'feelings', 'lovelessness', 'distance', 'hearing', 'death', 'mother', 'lover', 'Eva', 'mother', 'Charlotte', 'visit', 'seven-year', 'hiatus', 'old', 'professional', 'pianist', 'acquiesces', 'Eva', 'feelings', 'Charlotte', 'are', 'very', 'complex', 'seem', 'unfold', 'film', 'layers', 'peeling', 'away', 'eventually', 'sides.Charlotte', 'arrival', 'sophisticated', 'worldly', 'older', 'woman', 'who', 'demanding', 'easily', 'overshadowing', 'quiet', 'daughter', 'Quickly', 'upstaging', 'situation', 'Charlotte', 'breathlessly', 'Eva', 'tale', 'Leonardo', 'slow', 'death', 'bedside', 'vigil', 'suddenly', 'changing', 'gears', 'when', 'other', 'daughter', 'Helena', 'staying', 'Eva', 'parsonage', 'been', 'several', 'years', 'Charlotte', 'face', 'shock', 'clearly', 'enough', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'made', 'visit', 'had', 'known', 'When', 'Lena', 'deteriorated', 'condition', 'spastic', 'only', 'able', 'be', 'understood', 'Eva', 'still', 'control', 'situation', 'know', 'internally', 'odds', 'outward', 'features.It', 'apparent', 'Eva', 'still', 'child', 'approval', 'mother', 'When', 'feelings', 'death', 'son', 'Erik', 'mother', 'politely', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'touch', 'real', 'emotions', 'there', 'glare', 'own', 'emotional', 'spotlight', 'can', 'not', 'shake', 'egoism', 'always', 'death', 'Erik', 'created', 'departures', 'different', 'levels', 'parents', 'one', 'one', 'side', 'Viktor', 'life', 'grayed', 'again', 'Eva', 'feelings', 'Erik', 'were', 'left', 'uncorroded', 'heaven', 'world', 'liberated', 'feelings', 'one', 'night', 'insomnia', 'mother', 'chance', 'share', 'true', 'feelings', 'her.Eva', 'recounts', 'mother', 'missed', 'time', 'adolescence', 'when', 'Charlotte', 'was', 'abroad', 'entertaining', 'foreign', 'crowds', 'indulging', 'own', 'selfish', 'appetites', 'Eva', 'wine', 'bibbing', 'tongue', 'raw', 'emotional', 'exchange', 'time', 'depart', 'mother/daughter', 'roles', 'deal', 'other', 'first', 'time', 'equals', 'adulthood', 'lengthy', 'beautiful', 'soliloquy', 'Eva', 'had', 'charge', 'words', 'home', 'grand', 'way', 'put', 'Bergman', 'great', 'success', 'writing', 'difficult', 'scenes', 'lack', 'sentimentality', 'balanced', 'pathos', 'scenes', 'are', 'emoted', 'wonderfully', 'two', 'actors', 'captured', 'beautifully', 'long-time', 'Bergman', 'cinematographer', 'Sven', 'Nykvist', 'film', 'crescendos', 'point', 'heading', 'recapitulation', 'elements', 'musical', 'sonata', 'Autumn', 'Sonata', 'great', 'film', 'Bergman', 'corpus', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A
25376,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,0780021118,Christopher Culver,"[1, 2]","Ingmar Bergman's 1978 film HOSTSONATEN (Autumn Sonata) portrays the troubled relationship between a distant mother, Charlotte (Ingrid Bergman) and her wounded daughter Eva (Liv Ullmann). Eva leads a quiet life along a Norwegian fjord with her priest husband Viktor (Halvar Bj&ouml;rk), while Charlotte is a famed pianist who travels the world for concerts. When Charlotte comes to visit, Eva is initially joyful, but within just a few hours all of Eva's bottled up emotions spill over. Some remarkable flashbacks reveal the betrayals that Charlotte inflicted on her family while pursuing her career (they feature Erland Josefsson as Eva's father, through in a silent role). As mother and daughter bicker, weep and confess their sins, one might expect a happy ending. Bergman provides something rather different, however, and it undoubtedly will make some viewers furious. Nonetheless, I enjoy the film's observation that in real life, not all attempts at resolution between two people are successful.Bergman has tended to portray priests either as pure evil (FANNY OCH ALEXANDER, DET SJUNDE INSEGLET), or good but very tormented (NATTVARDSGAESTERNA). Here, it's refreshing to see the vicar as a humble, content fellow and a loving husband. Lena Nyman's role as Eva's disabled sister is convincingly played, and the pain Bergman communicates through this part is devastating. The script includes a number of very quotable lines. There's been a tendency to treat the several film Bergman produced between the mid-1970s and FANNY OCH ALEXANDER as minor, but I would rank HOSTSONATEN among his best work.",5,A scarring and utterly believable tale of parent-child conflict,1256688000,"10 28, 2009",2009,1600,"['Ingmar', 'Bergman', '1978', 'film', 'HOSTSONATEN', 'Autumn', 'Sonata', 'troubled', 'relationship', 'distant', 'mother', 'Charlotte', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'wounded', 'daughter', 'Eva', 'Liv', 'Ullmann', 'Eva', 'quiet', 'life', 'Norwegian', 'fjord', 'priest', 'husband', 'Viktor', 'Halvar', 'Bj', 'ouml', 'rk', 'Charlotte', 'famed', 'pianist', 'who', 'world', 'concerts', 'When', 'Charlotte', 'visit', 'Eva', 'initially', 'joyful', 'just', 'few', 'hours', 'Eva', 'bottled', 'up', 'emotions', 'spill', 'remarkable', 'flashbacks', 'reveal', 'betrayals', 'Charlotte', 'inflicted', 'family', 'pursuing', 'career', 'feature', 'Erland', 'Josefsson', 'Eva', 'father', 'silent', 'role', 'mother', 'daughter', 'bicker', 'weep', 'confess', 'sins', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'happy', 'ending', 'Bergman', 'something', 'rather', 'different', 'however', 'undoubtedly', 'will', 'make', 'viewers', 'furious', 'Nonetheless', 'enjoy', 'film', 'observation', 'real', 'life', 'not', 'attempts', 'resolution', 'two', 'people', 'are', 'successful.Bergman', 'tended', 'portray', 'priests', 'pure', 'evil', 'FANNY', 'OCH', 'ALEXANDER', 'DET', 'SJUNDE', 'INSEGLET', 'good', 'very', 'tormented', 'NATTVARDSGAESTERNA', 'Here', 'refreshing', 'see', 'vicar', 'humble', 'content', 'fellow', 'loving', 'husband', 'Lena', 'Nyman', 'role', 'Eva', 'disabled', 'sister', 'convincingly', 'played', 'pain', 'Bergman', 'part', 'devastating', 'script', 'number', 'very', 'quotable', 'lines', 'been', 'tendency', 'treat', 'several', 'film', 'Bergman', 'produced', 'mid-1970s', 'FANNY', 'OCH', 'ALEXANDER', 'minor', 'would', 'rank', 'HOSTSONATEN', 'best', 'work']",N/A

It is also the most emotionally intense of the series of Strindbergian or Chekhovian chamber dramas he has filmed over the years, which includes his Spider Trilogy (Through A Glass Darkly, Winter Light, The Silence) and such other films as Cries And Whispers. That said, it is perhaps the simplest film that Bergman ever directed, even simpler in plot than The Silence. It was filmed in Norway whilst Bergman was in his self-imposed exile from Sweden over trumped up tax evasion charges, and backed with British and American money. Ingrid Bergman, meanwhile, had just been diagnosed with the cancer that would kill her a few years later, and this was he last acting role for film, although she did a final television movie portraying Golda Meier.The whole film basically revolves around the tensions between a famous pianist, Charlotte (Ingrid Bergman), and her visit to her emotionally fragile and bitter eldest daughter Eva (Liv Ullman), a four-eyed frump, who lives with her pastor husband in a vicarage. Bergman always seems his best when two female leads are front and center. He may be the best director of actresses in cinema history, and certainly the best writer for them....The camerawork by Sven Nykvist is not as blatantly showy in this film, although quite painterly in the gorgeous colorful interior of the vicarage is stunning in its reflection of the autumnal feel of the film and the state the characters are in, especially the gallery of close-ups that sear these characters and their emotions into a viewer's mind....Charlotte reminds me much of the Maureen Stapleton character, Pearl, from Woody Allen's Interiors, right down to her garish red dress, which clearly shows that she is vibrant and faces life, and to the motto she claims came from her lover, Leonardo: `A sense of reality is a matter of talent. Most people lack that talent and maybe it's just as well.'....Ingmar Bergman is certainly a great director, but that greatness stems from his being a great writer, first and foremost. His writing is for adults, and not the deliterate preteens that current publishers (think Dave Eggers, James Frey, Elizabeth Wurtzel) and Hollywood studios aim their wares at.

It is obvious, at the end of the movie, that they won't see  each other for the next seven years to come.Like in a sonata, the first  part of the movie is relatively quiet, the characters keeping their  distances and trying to live with each other.

Well, the  symbol is a little bit heavy but the scenes involving Elena are going to  make you feel uneasy.The last part of the movie is a verbal duel between  the mother and the daughter which goes crescendo and finishes in an  explosion of hidden memories.As I said before, AUTUMN SONATA is not a  comedy nor the psychological saturday night TV movie you are familiar with,  it's one of the last movies of a genius of cinema, it's a movie which  deserves to be rediscovered.An interesting commentary, a trailer and a  dubbed version as bonus features.

In this film, Bergman makes little attempt to make Charlotte (Ingrid Bergman) sympathetic - her glamour and charm is noisy, superficially clever and phoney; her reactions to trauma damning.For some reason, people thought it a big deal that filmmakers with the same surname should work together; Ingmar, however, clearly doesn't have the same imaginative, creative, historical and personal sympathy for Ingrid as he did for Victor Sjostrom, hence the flimsiness of 'Autumn Sonata' compared to 'Strawberries'.There's nothing really wrong with it, the performances are pitch-perfect, the compositions are meticulous tableaux (the flashbacks are expecially beautiful), the narrative structure suitably elaborate and elusive.  The film begins with the stolid complacency of Victor, spying and ruminating on his wife, trying to control our view of her; it proceeds by peeling back the politeness and civility and culture layer by layer, to reveal the festering, ugly scars beneath.It just seems perfunctory, to lack passion, as if Ingmar didn't trust Ingrid to reach as deeply into her soul as he's used to demanding of his actors, because she's a Hollywood actress (despite having starred in masterpieces for Hitchcock and Rossellini).  The story is much soapier, more predictable, more Hollywood than we expect from Bergman, as if to condescend to his actress, as Ingrid stands there waiting for a genuine challenge.  Even Liv Ullmann seems merely professional compared to her harrowing work in 'Scenes from a marriage' or 'Persona'.

25382,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0780021118,Dennis Littrell,"[5, 8]","Before she was an international star of incomparable charisma and beauty, and even before Ingmar Bergman became a legendary director of films bleak and intense, Ingrid Bergman played in the Swedish cinema.  So it is entirely apropos that someday Bergman might direct Bergman.Ingrid plays Charlotte, a concert pianist who has, upon the recent death of her longtime lover, Leonardo, returned to her native land to visit her daughter Eva (Liv Ullmann), whom she hasn't seen for seven years, and her husband Viktor (Halvar Bjork), who is a minister.  Ullmann is frumpish in specs with her hair up and her dress loose and ill-fitting.  She is Ingrid's nerdish daughter who has been throughout her life entirely overshadowed by her glamorous mother.  Eva has an unpleasant surprise for mom.  Her other daughter, Helena (Lena Nyman), who suffers from a crippling disease, perhaps muscular dystrophy, is on hand.  Eva didn't tell her mother that Helena was now living with them.  She says she didn't tell her because she knew that, if she had, Charlotte would not have come.  And so we can guess that there are issues that will come out, issues between mother and daughter that have been festering for decades.I got goose bumps seeing Ingrid Bergman as an elderly woman, and seeing the smooth, graceful style again, the elegant presence, a hint of the old gestures, the sly glances, the tentative half smiles...  It was really wonderful and at the same time disconcerting to examine her face (Sven Nykvist's intense close ups expose every inch of skin) and sigh and remember and understand the effect of the passing years.  Ingrid is elegant but she has been robbed of her beauty so now we are able to see her character; unfortunately Ingmar's script allows little of the real Ingrid Bergman to appear.  Hers is not a pleasant part to play.  She is an entirely selfish and self-centered woman who has put her career before her family, but is unaware of what she has done.  Eva seizes this opportunity to punish her mother by dredging up the neglect of her childhood to throw it in her mother's face (which perhaps explains why Charlotte hasn't been home in seven years).  The sheer cold hatred that Eva expresses is enough to make the devil himself cringe.  After a bit one begins to feel sorry for Charlotte, despite her failures as a mother, to have a daughter so unforgiving and so hateful.Liv Ullmann is rather startling in this portrayal, with her penetrating eyes, her hard, Neandethalish forehead, the severe specs, and the uncompromising tone of her voice.  Charlotte is ashamed and begs for forgiveness and tries to defend herself, but it is no use.  Eva is too strong for her.  This is one of the more intense scenes in cinema, and one not easily watched.  Meanwhile in the upstairs bedroom and then in the hallway and down the staircase, Helena has heard them arguing and is pulling her crippled body over the floor, desperately trying to reach them.  She cries out, &quot;Mama!  Mama!&quot; but is not heard.Viewers might want to pick sides between mother and daughter to say which is the more at fault.  Indeed, it is hard to say who Bergman himself found more at fault.  Perhaps there is no fault, only human weakness and stupidity.  Such scenes are usually followed by a greater understanding, forgiveness and a willingness to start anew.  However, although Charlotte wants that, it is not clear in Bergman's script that anything good will come of what has happened.  Charlotte leaves, the minister returns to looking at his wife, (having overheard the argument, about which he has said nothing) and Eva writes a letter to her mother.  It is not clear whether she wants to patch things up or to gain another opportunity to pick her mother to pieces.  The viewer is left to decide.Perhaps the best scene in the film is the one that follows dinner the night of Charlotte's arrival in which Eva plays the piano, a Chopin prelude.  She has worked hard on it and hopes to please her mother.  Alas, her play is not so good.  After all, the mother is a genius, the daughter only the daughter of a genius.  Charlotte sits down next to Eva and takes the keys to gently demonstrate how the piece should be played.  We see and feel at once the inadequacy of the daughter in her mother's eyes.  It is a great scene filmed with a tight focus on the faces of the two women.  When Eva turns to stare at her mother, who is, of course, playing brilliantly with great finesse and touch, the expression on Eva's face, held for many long seconds, is unforgettable.Not to second guess the master, but I would have liked to have seen the entire movie played in this, a more subtle key than that which followed.  However when it comes to dysfunction and disease, Ingmar Bergman is unrestrained.Ingrid Bergman was nominated for an academy award for best actress in this, her last feature film (she had already been diagnosed with cancer), but lost out to Jane Fonda in Coming Home (1978).",4,Bergman directs Bergman,993340800,"06 24, 2001",2001,4971,"['was', 'international', 'star', 'incomparable', 'charisma',

This was the first Liv Ullmann's film I've seen and the first Bergman's color film. It is considered to be Ingrid Bergman's film and she is phenomenal as a talented and world renowned pianist who had never been a good mother to her two daughters. It is much easier to make the whole world happy then your own child. One can be a brilliant artist and read the minds of the other great minds easily but the hearts and souls of one's own blood and flesh would be the unsolved mystery. I think the film was very personal for both Bergmans in their only work together. It is amazing how bravely they explore the themes and events that could've (and did) occurred in their own lives. For me, though, the film belongs to Liv Ullmann, the greatest actress I've seen, the best Ingmar Bergman's actress.I was riveted to Liv's face; I'd never seen the face like hers. She played a plain daughter to the brilliant mother and she was supposed to look and feel awkward and gawky comparing to her mother but her face was like a magnet, her eyes - like two deep blue lakes. If ever the saying, the eyes are the soul's mirror, is true, it is about Liv's eyes. There are kindness, tenderness, strength, and something even more attractive than beauty itself in them - the goodness of her soul.

25385,A2A0U27BHHWOES,0780021118,G. Bestick,"[4, 5]","Two of Scandinavia's top actresses light up the screen in this classic tale of a mother and daughter trying to get a grip on the past and on each other.An aging but still magnetic Ingrid Bergman is Charlotte, a concert pianist with an international reputation.  She gets a letter from her daughter Eva (an incandescent Liv Ullmann) inviting her for a visit.  The two haven't seen each other for seven years.  In that time, Eva has married Viktor (Halvar Bjork) a pastor in rural Norway and moved to the parsonage with him.  They've had a son together, Erik, who drowned when he was four.  Charlotte has another daughter, Helena, with a spastic condition that renders her nearly mute and mostly immobile.  After Charlotte arrives, Eva informs her that she's moved Helena into the parsonage, which Charlotte reads as a rebuke to her own decision to place Helena in an institution.This is one of Ingmar Bergman's chamber movies, in which he puts a small number of characters in a claustrophobic setting and steadily builds up the pressure until emotions explode.  Charlotte and Eva start off cordial to one another, but Eva's anger at her mother for sins of omission and commission can't be contained.  Her sense of grievance builds, reaching a crescendo in a late night scene where the wine comes out and the gloves come off.As is often the case with Ingmar Bergman's chamber movies, a somewhat schematic script is offset by brilliant moviemaking.  This begins with the actresses.  Ingrid Bergman (ill with cancer during the filming) gives a superb performance.  Ullmann's would be astonishing if he hadn't seen her hit these heights in Bergman's movies time and again.  Cinematographer Sven Nyquist's captivating lighting shows the characters moving in and out of the shadows in the parsonage, an analogue for the moments of illumination and concealment Eva and Charlotte experience in their confrontations with one another.The blocking and framing and editing are superb.  In one particularly mesmerizing scene, Charlotte is at the piano playing a difficult concerto.  All of her attention is on the instrument.  Eva sits on the bench next to her, and we see Charlotte in profile to the right of the frame and Eva facing forward.  As Charlotte plays, a lifetime of emotions pass across Eva's face: appreciation tinged with envy at her mother's talent; sadness at the price her mother paid to pursue that talent, and sadness at the cost to those who loved her; and, finally, anger as she realizes she's lost her mother yet again to music, the one thing that truly matters to Charlotte.  It's a stunning piece of acting and filmmaking.Charlotte leaves for her next concert.  We see her on the train with her agent.  Her makeup is in place, and the confusion and vulnerability she let peek out during the long night with Eva have been tucked away.  Charlotte is a tough woman for whom the show must go on, no matter the price.  Our last glimpse of Eva is back at the parsonage.  She's written another letter to her mother; she hopes they'll continue trying to reach out to one another.  Eva has had her catharsis, but she's still locked in to the little girl she was, endlessly yearning for what she'll never get. We see Charlotte reading the letter, skepticism spreading across her face: she's not going back there.As Peter Cowie points out in his commentary, the characters' scripted emotions resonate in Bergman's personal life.  As he reveals in Bergman Island, the recently released biographical film by Marie Nyrerod, Bergman felt guilty about neglecting his own children while he poured all his emotional energy in to his film and theater families.  This movie is an earlier attempt to come to grips with that guilt, and makes the case for both the narcissistic artist and the victims damaged by the artist's emotional triage.  The two great actresses use their magic to bring this dilemma movingly and memorably to life.",4,Mother and Child Reunion,1165708800,"12 10, 2006",2006,3925,"['Two', 'Scandinavia', 'top', 'actresses', 'light', 'up', 'screen', 'classic', 'tale', 'mother', 'daughter', 'trying', 'get', 'grip', 'past', 'other.An', 'aging', 'still', 'magnetic', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'Charlotte', 'concert', 'pianist', 'international', 'reputation', 'letter', 'daughter', 'Eva', 'incandescent', 'Liv', 'Ullmann', 'inviting', 'visit', 'two', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'seven', 'years', 'time', 'Eva', 'married', 'Viktor', 'Halvar', 'Bjork', 'pastor', 'rural', 'Norway', 'moved', 'parsonage', ""'ve"", 'had', 'son', 'together', 'Erik', 'who', 'drowned', 'when', 'was', 'four', 'Charlotte', 'daughter', 'Helena', 'spastic', 'condition', 'nearly', 'mute', 'mostly', 'immobile', 'Charlotte', 'Eva', 'moved', 'Helena', 'parsonage', 'Charlotte', 'rebuke', 'own', 'decision', 'place', 'Helena', 'institution.This', 'one', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'chamber', 'movies', 'small', 'number', 'characters', 'claustrophobic', 'setting', 'steadily', 'up', 'pressure', 'emotions', 'explode', 'Charlotte', 'Eva', 'start', 'cordial', 'one', 'Eva', 'anger', 'mother', 'sins', 'omission', 'commission', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'contained', 'sense', 'grievance', 'builds', 'reaching', 'crescendo', 'late', 'night', 'scene', 'where', 'wine', 'out', 'gloves', 'come', 'off.As', 'often', 'case', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'chamber', 'movies', 'somewhat', 'schematic', 'script', 'offset', 'brilliant', 'moviemaking', 'actresses', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'ill', 'cancer', 'filming', 'superb', 'performance', 'Ullmann', 'would', 'be', 'astonishing', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'hit', 'heights', 'Bergman', 'movies', 'time', 'again', 'Cinematographer', 'Sven', 'Nyquist', 'captivating', 'lighting', 'characters', 'moving', 'shadows', 'parsonage', 'analogue', 'moments', 'illumination', 'concealment', 'Eva', 'Charlotte', 'experience', 'confrontations', 'one', 'another.The', 'blocking', 'framing', 'editing', 'are', 'superb', 'one', 'particularly', 'mesmerizing', 'scene', 'Charlotte', 'piano', 'playing', 'difficult', 'concerto', 'attention', 'instrument', 'Eva', 'bench', 'next', 'see', 'Charlotte', 'profile', 'right', 'frame', 'Eva', 'facing', 'forward', 'Charlotte', 'lifetime', 'emotions', 'pass', 'Eva', 'face', 'appreciation', 'tinged', 'envy', 'mother', 'talent', 'sadness', 'price', 'mother', 'paid', 'pursue', 'talent', 'sadness', 'cost', 'who', 'loved', 'finally', 'anger', 'lost', 'mother', 'yet', 'again', 'music', 'one', 'thing', 'matters', 'Charlotte', 'stunning', 'piece', 'acting', 'filmmaking.Charlotte', 'leaves', 'next', 'concert', 'see', 'train', 'agent', 'makeup', 'place', 'confusion', 'vulnerability', 'let', 'peek', 'out', 'long', 'night', 'Eva', 'have', 'been', 'tucked', 'away', 'Charlotte', 'tough', 'woman', 'whom', 'show', 'must', 'go', 'matter', 'price', 'last', 'glimpse', 'Eva', 'back', 'parsonage', 'written', 'letter', 'mother', ""'ll"", 'continue', 'trying', 'reach', 'out', 'one', 'Eva', 'had', 'catharsis', 'still', 'locked', 'little', 'girl', 'was', 'endlessly', 'yearning', 'what', ""'ll"", 'never', 'get', 'see', 'Charlotte', 'reading', 'letter', 'skepticism', 'spreading', 'face', 'not', 'going', 'back', 'there.As', 'Peter', 'Cowie', 'out', 'commentary', 'characters', 'scripted', 'emotions', 'resonate', 'Bergman', 'personal', 'life', 'Bergman', 'Island', 'recently', 'released', 'biographical', 'film', 'Marie', 'Nyrerod', 'Bergman', 'felt', 'guilty', 'neglecting', 'own', 'children', 'poured', 'emotional', 'energy', 'film', 'theater', 'families', 'movie', 'earlier', 'attempt', 'come', 'grips', 'guilt', 'case', 'narcissistic', 'artist', 'victims', 'damaged', 'artist', 'emotional', 'triage', 'two', 'great', 'actresses', 'use', 'magic', 'bring', 'dilemma', 'movingly', 'memorably', 'life']",N/A

And should much of what is said have been said years and years before?  Of course, you shout! But I hear others murmuring that much of what is said between most of us might be better left unsaid, since it is either fully understood without saying or else uselessly hurtful to say.And is there anything left to say about this drama made in 1977 that hasn't been said at length and repeatedly? If you can watch this film without being powerfully affected, you belong to a different species, possibly cyborg. Me, I'm of the mother's species, a concert musician and perhaps as much a self-invented public person as she; the recognition of commonality with her seized me by the throat, as I'm sure it seized the actress, the great Ingrid Bergman, who played the role. And what could this revelation of the narcissism of the Artist have meant to director Ingmar Bergmann but some measure of a confession?One thing that needs to be said and said again is that Ingrid and Liv deliver incredibly sensitive, plausible performances. Nothing short of thespian immortality!

I want to use the word ""agon"" here in its classical Greek sense of a formal convention of the theater, of a scripted contest/conflict among the Gods.

25387,ACO20QL72D1E6,0780021118,"Henning Sebastian Jahre ""Judy-Viv""","[1, 2]","Ingrid Bergman shines as Charlotte in this film, she`s not merely a Hollywood star, but a working actress in this film. Ingmar Bergman has many a time told the story of how he had to work on her(she had planned her performance in detail before they met).She agreed to c the rushes and agreed she was overplaying. They had to take it from there and their long discussions and arguments  made Ullmann cry and think it wouldn`t work out.As it turned out; it did.

Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[0, 1]","In this 1978 film Ingmar Bergman for the first and only time directs Ingrid Bergman in her last movie performance for which she received an Oscar nomination as the self-centered, selfish elegant concert pianist Charlotte who may be the image of poise and perfection in a piano recital but is an utter failure as a mother. This intense and somber film has to do with her daughter Eva's (Liv Ullman) attempts to have a relationship with her mother at last. It is obvious that there is a close connection between love and hate. Eva on the one hand has all this residual hatred for her mother who deserted her often for concert tours but is also hurting desparately for her mother's approval and affection. We are reminded that children never, never abandon the hope that their parents will love them.As we expect in many Bergman movies, the characters just talk so there are many closeups, particularly of Bergman and Ullman. The film is shot in color (with much made of the color red and combinations thereof) and in Swedish. Ullman and Bergman of course give stunning performances that are often practically too painful to watch.

The mother, Ingrid Bergman is a classic pianist who has triumphed all around the world but the happiness, as eveybody knows, is never free. Her daughter (Liv Ullman) is almost an emotional orphan. She has been grown up so distant from her mother and the necessary support and love in special moments of the life simply existed never. The dialogues are merciless; Liv is uncapable to understand and obviously to forget or forgive; there have been so many affective wounds and her behavior's mother has always been the same: the getaway and the double moral. A letter, a postcard a call phone from time to time to check if everything is alright.You are emotionally invalid! This shocking insult still resounds in my mind from the first time I watched this glorious and intimate portrait.The last films of the sixties such as Persona, Hour of the wolf The shame, The passion of Anna meant a clear signal, an obvious turning point and if you want a major attention to the intimate and progressive emotive crisis that can be sustained by a long interview given for him in Cannes 1966: ""Nowadays the art has lost its force and it seems actually just the first skin of a serpent, but not the serpent.""  So under this statement, it seems reasonable the intimate concerns and artistic efforts would walk by the harrowing and disturbing atmosphere of the absence of a real gravity emotive center in the human being. If you add God's silence, the triumph of the Death (The seventh seal) and the lost faith, Bergman was crossing a vast and complex but not least, a fascinating exploration and even a formidable journey to the roots of the human soul.That's why Ingmar Bergman made a decisive twist of fate in the seventies, and focused his energies in the disturbing emotional human relationship; from Cries and Whispers to Scenes of a marriage Bergman faced the challenge the Strindberg environment and became himself much more intimate and more human if you want, employing all his wisdom and experience, specially toward the female universe, and this was specially a big point to his favor due the female universe is not only more complex than the male one, but besides much more intense, interesting and dramatic in all the word's extension.

He was able to show in his dialectically opposite approach,  the vulnerabilities of the narcisstic artist and the self depreciating/ martyr.  They exposed themselves,  faced off and retreated to their comfortable life positions by the end of the movie.  The use of the unnamed ailment of the younger daughter represents the other side of mother who often cries as a baby of her back pain, but at least is left whole enough to express herself also in her music.  The death of the son at age four I think represents the symbolic death of the innocence in all of the &quot;chamber music&quot; of characters in this film (mother, daughters and husband) which Bergman uses in many of his movies.

25393,A75MSQQ3LN86Z,0780021118,Josef Bush,"[0, 1]","Recently heard McMurty holding forth on the diminishment of reading in our culture; not so much the advancement of illiteracy, only the shrinking community of functioning literacy in politics, the arts and culture, and in human interaction.  It would seem that the big books, the 19th century ""psychological"" novels as well as novels of social relevance and insight, are becoming neglected and consequently irrelevant.  Probably true.  And I could say, following that line of thought, that the big movies (and by that I mean complex, often novel-into-film movies) that used to dominate one's concerns, as well as the high end of SHOWBIZ biz, are themselves vanishing.  There are fewer of them and their emotional content appears to have been diluted by cinematic or photographic effects; all flash and dazzle.  If that decline in cinematic literacy has been a constant over the past few decades, say, since the end of the Cold War, then little, distilled small screen films like this one appear more potent, more suffused with meaning and importance by contrast with...  What might have been.  Bergman's SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE may have begun the trend in two-character, intimate dramas.  It was a for-TV show and had a big impact.  Imitators here and abroad followed.  For me, an over-abundance of riches.  Except for Fassbinder, nobody equaled Bergman, though Allen came and comes close.Personally, I am not greatly entheused by the prospect of prolonged intimate contact with people who are, after all, only fictional creations with bourgeois concerns and trappings, behaving in fixed, artistically-contrived situations, no matter how convincing-looking they appear to be.  One thinks of the neuroticism of Pfeiffer cartoons.Myself, dealing with people and their often literarily-inspired fantasies about their often predictable agonies of self importance is seldom entertaining or even bearable, like Freudian parlor games.  Fortunately, skilled keen-edged artists like Bergman are able to trim the psycho-fat from even the seemingly unavoidale, even obligatory in vino veritas spasms of self-revelation -- like that of daughter Liv Ulman here, and mother Ingrid Bergman -- and present us with something like a dramatic scene, with a beginning a middle and an end.  But not quite.  To have been raised by a narcissistic parent resonates, but...  Not quite.This remarkable work, and it is truly remarkably realized, with moments of surprising and shocking beauty, has much of that quality Maughm disliked in the plays of Chekov; to him they seemed not complete or completed works, but disturbing, self-indulgent character sketches.  I agree.  Even this piece has the quality of a sketch for a larger, future project.  And so it falls into a category of size and/or scale like a Novella to a Novel, or a Sketch or Print to a Painting.  And that's not a bad thing.  We don't look at prints much, anymore; etchings, engravings, block prints and wood engravings, and when we think of them at all, if and when we ever do, we tend to see them in our minds on walls, displayed the way small pictures are usually shown.  But this is inappropriate.  The best way to enjoy a print is at something a bit less than arm's length, as it is mounted on paper in a folder or portfolio, and that folio rests on an easel.  We read a pring much as we read a printed or illuminated page.  And if  you have ever looked into a Rembrandt etching no bigger than a couple of inches square, you know what I mean.And this wonderful thing is of that Rembrandt nature; something not best seen blown up on a big screen, or projected for a big audience in a darkened cinema, but best shown and best enjoyed in solitude, projected on a television screen.  On that scale it comes into its own as a treasure meant to be savored in privacy:  Something like one of those carved jade pieces that are pretty to look at and to examine on a writing table, but best reveal their true glory when held in a warm and appreciative hand.A quiet, intimate revelation.",5,"NOT A MOVIE; RATHER, A KIND OF CINEMATIC NOVELLA",1233705600,"02 4, 2009",2009,4021,"['Recently', 'heard', 'McMurty', 'holding', 'forth', 'diminishment', 'reading', 'culture', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'advancement', 'illiteracy', 'only', 'shrinking', 'community', 'functioning', 'literacy', 'politics', 'arts', 'culture', 'human', 'interaction', 'would', 'seem', 'big', 'books', '19th', 'century', 'psychological', 'novels', 'as', 'well', 'novels', 'social', 'relevance', 'insight', 'are', 'becoming', 'neglected', 'consequently', 'irrelevant', 'Probably', 'true', 'could', 'say', 'following', 'line', 'thought', 'big', 'movies', 'mean', 'complex', 'often', 'novel-into-film', 'movies', 'used', 'dominate', 'one', 'concerns', 'as', 'well', 'high', 'end', 'SHOWBIZ', 'biz', 'are', 'vanishing', 'are', 'fewer', 'emotional', 'content', 'have', 'been', 'diluted', 'cinematic', 'photographic', 'effects', 'flash', 'dazzle', 'decline', 'cinematic', 'literacy', 'been', 'constant', 'past', 'few', 'decades', 'say', 'end', 'Cold', 'War', 'then', 'little', 'distilled', 'small', 'screen', 'films', 'one', 'appear', 'more', 'potent', 'more', 'suffused', 'meaning', 'importance', 'contrast', 'What', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Bergman', 'SCENES', 'FROM', 'A', 'MARRIAGE', 'may', 'have', 'begun', 'trend', 'two-character', 'intimate', 'dramas', 'was', 'for-TV', 'show', 'had', 'big', 'impact', 'Imitators', 'here', 'abroad', 'followed', 'over-abundance', 'riches', 'Fassbinder', 'nobody', 'equaled', 'Bergman', 'Allen', 'came', 'close.Personally', 'am', 'not', 'greatly', 'entheused', 'prospect', 'prolonged', 'intimate', 'contact', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'only', 'fictional', 'creations', 'bourgeois', 'concerns', 'trappings', 'behaving', 'fixed', 'artistically-contrived', 'situations', 'matter', 'how', 'convincing-looking', 'appear', 'be', 'One', 'neuroticism', 'Pfeiffer', 'cartoons.Myself', 'dealing', 'people', 'often', 'literarily-inspired', 'fantasies', 'often', 'predictable', 'agonies', 'self', 'importance', 'seldom', 'entertaining', 'even', 'bearable', 'Freudian', 'parlor', 'games', 'Fortunately', 'skilled', 'keen-edged', 'artists', 'Bergman', 'are', 'able', 'trim', 'psycho-fat', 'even', 'seemingly', 'unavoidale', 'even', 'obligatory', 'vino', 'veritas', 'spasms', 'self-revelation', 'daughter', 'Liv', 'Ulman', 'here', 'mother', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'present', 'something', 'dramatic', 'scene', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'not', 'quite', 'have', 'been', 'raised', 'narcissistic', 'parent', 'resonates', 'Not', 'quite.This', 'remarkable', 'work', 'truly', 'remarkably', 'realized', 'moments', 'surprising', 'shocking', 'beauty', 'much', 'quality', 'Maughm', 'disliked', 'plays', 'Chekov', 'seemed', 'not', 'complete', 'completed', 'works', 'disturbing', 'self-indulgent', 'character', 'sketches', 'agree', 'Even', 'piece', 'quality', 'sketch', 'larger', 'future', 'project', 'category', 'size', 'and/or', 'scale', 'Novella', 'Novel', 'Sketch', 'Print', 'Painting', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'prints', 'much', 'anymore', 'etchings', 'engravings', 'block', 'prints', 'wood', 'engravings', 'when', 'think', 'when', 'ever', 'do', 'tend', 'see', 'minds', 'walls', 'displayed', 'way', 'small', 'pictures', 'are', 'usually', 'shown', 'inappropriate', 'best', 'way', 'enjoy', 'print', 'something', 'bit', 'less', 'arm', 'length', 'mounted', 'paper', 'folder', 'portfolio', 'folio', 'rests', 'easel', 'read', 'pring', 'much', 'read', 'printed', 'illuminated', 'page', 'have', 'ever', 'looked', 'Rembrandt', 'etching', 'no', 'bigger', 'couple', 'inches', 'square', 'know', 'what', 'mean.And', 'wonderful', 'thing', 'Rembrandt', 'nature', 'something', 'not', 'best', 'seen', 'blown', 'up', 'big', 'screen', 'projected', 'big', 'audience', 'darkened', 'cinema', 'best', 'shown', 'best', 'enjoyed', 'solitude', 'projected', 'television', 'screen', 'scale', 'own', 'treasure', 'meant', 'be', 'savored', 'privacy', 'Something', 'one', 'carved', 'jade', 'pieces', 'are', 'pretty', 'look', 'examine', 'writing', 'table', 'best', 'reveal', 'true', 'glory', 'when', 'held', 'warm', 'appreciative', 'hand.A', 'quiet', 'intimate', 'revelation']",N/A
25394,AYCJSA9HR7TKO,0780021118,Kerry Walters,"[3, 3]","In his memoir Images, Bergman concludes that ""Autumn Sonata"" isn't a successful film for two reasons.  First, he says that he lacked the courage or the talent to make the film what he originally envisioned:  a drama in which the long night of recrimination leads to the daughter Eva (Liv Ullmann) rebirthing the mother Charlotte (Ingrid Bergman).  There's precious little rebirth in the final version of the film.  Second, Bergman worries that the film was too self-consciously Bergmanian:  that is, he'd fallen into the trap of making movies that he was expected to make.I think the film is more successful than Bergman's appraisal suggests, but it's not one of his best ones.  Somehow Eva's husband Viktor (Halvar Bjork) seems a fifth wheel.  It's not clear what purpose his character plays.  More importantly, though, Bergman couldn't quite get Ingrid Bergman to quit being the grand actress of the 1940s and enter into the ensemble acting spirit of his scripts.  At times, especially in the first half hour or so of the film, to be entirely uncomfortable with her role.  that she was nominated for an academy role was surely an homage to her career rather than her performance.The film is intriguing, as all Bergman films are, because it invites us to explore the boundaries of repressed anger, parental-children relations, false memories, and the dynamics of forgiving.  Eva feels stunted by her overbearing and aloof mother, and in the terrible night in which cards are laid on the table she shrieks that her entire life has been ruined by her childhood.  But it's clear that Eva to a certain extent is using memories, false or otherwise, to excuse her own failings.  She has been warped by her mother; there's no doubt of that, and Bergman uses the crippled sister Helena (Lena Nyman) as a very visible metaphor to convey the point.  But at least some of Eva's neurosis is of her own making.  So fascinating questions of the complexity of forgiving when false memories are at play get raised by the film.Liv Ullmann is outstanding as Eva, the broken, neurotic, incredibly angry, and frozen daughter who longs for love but mistrusts any loving overture.  Her performance is hands-down the best in the film.  Next to her, Ingrid Bergman seems awkward.It's worth noting that although ""Autumn Sonata"" is one of his chamber pieces, it's nonetheless one of the few films Bergman made which features natural landscape.

Charlotte is at loose ends after her lover dies, and returns to Sweden to visit her daughter. Both mother and daughter share personal tragedies. Charlotte's daughter (and Eva's sister) Helena, who lives with Eva, is immobilized by a neurological disease. She hasn't told Charlotte that Helena is in the house, because she fears that her mother, repelled by Helena's disability, will refuse to visit. Eva's tragedy is the drowning of her four-year-old son, Erik. Her husband grieves, but in Eva's mind, he's still alive. Charlotte, who took excellent care of her lover in his final illness, has always neglected her daughters. She's frankly bored by Eva. In a brilliant scene, alone in the guest bedroom, she withdraws back into her private life, musing about money and playing Ravel. Poor Eva is still trying to wring some love and recognition out of her mother. The evening culminates in a middle of the night brawl between Eva and Charlotte. Eva accuses her mother of being cold, withholding and of abandoning her, Helena and their father. It seems to me that Eva is blaming her mother for too much and letting her father off the hook. When I first saw this film when I was younger, I identified with the Eva character, but now seeing it as an adult and a parent, I have more balanced sympathies. Charlotte is self-absorbed and puts her music first, but if she were a man it would be acceptable. She'll never give Eva the love she wants. Eva withdraws into her fantasy relationship with her dead son--in death, he gives her the unconditional acceptance she's always longed for. This is a brilliant film, both Ullman and Bergman are extraordinary and pull out the stops.

25400,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0780021118,Reviewer,"[43, 48]","Writer/director Ingmar Bergman examines the strained relationship between a mother and daughter in ""Autumn Sonata,"" starring Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullmann.  Eva (Ullmann) has not seen her mother, Charlotte (Bergman) in seven years; a successful concert pianist, Charlotte has spent a good portion of her life on the road, but after losing her long-time companion, Leonardo, Eva invites her to come to the parsonage where she and her minister husband, Viktor (Halvar Bjork), live, for an extended visit.  Charlotte accepts, but soon after her arrival, old wounds and feelings begin to surface, and the film becomes an intimate character study of the life-long dysfunctional relationship between Charlotte and Eva, during which director Bergman intricately examines the causes and effects of all that has passed between them during their lives.  It's an in-depth look at the emotional damage human beings are capable of inflicting upon one another, and how fragile the line between love and hate becomes when subjected to incessant neglect by even one of the parties involved.  As the story unfolds and the principals bare their souls-- at last revealing a lifetime's worth of repressed feelings-- it becomes an emotionally devastating experience for the audience, as well, for there is much contained within the dynamics of this situation that most viewers will be able to identify with and relate to within their own lives.  Ingmar Bergman is a Master of presenting life as it truly is; reality-- and portraying it on the screen-- is his domain, and throughout his career he has veritably created almost a genre of his own in doing so.  With a microscope of his own design, he scrutinizes the basic instincts of the human condition, what makes people tick and how and why they relate to one another as they do.  Much of what he presents is startling, and always emotionally involving, because he penetrates so deeply and succinctly into the heart of the matter, as he demonstrates so superlatively with this film.  His methods and style are unique, his talent unequivocal; many others have attempted to capture the essence of that which Bergman has perfected, but few have succeeded.  Interestingly enough, Liv Ullmann is one who, as a director, has probably come the closest to achieving that classic ""sense"" of Bergman, with her films ""Private Confessions,"" and ""Faithless,"" both of which were written by Bergman.  In her role as Eva, Ullmann gives one of the best performances of her career, for which she should have at least been nominated for an Oscar; that she was not is nothing less than a gross injustice.  She so skillfully conveys the depth and complexities of her character, and the differing emotional levels to which Eva is subjected, that it creates a lasting impression and makes her someone with whom it is easy for the audience to sympathize.  It makes you realize, upon reflection, what a truly gifted actress Ullmann is.  And, as good as Ullmann's performance here is, it is equaled-- though not, I would say-- surpassed, by Ingrid Bergman's portrayal (in her final theatrical appearance) of Charlotte; and in a renewal of faith that there is some justice in the world after all, she received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress for it.  In retrospect, it seems somehow inevitable that the two Bergmans came together at last, though it's somewhat lamentable that their career paths did not cross sooner.  There is some consolation, however, in the fact that when they did finally join forces the result was such a powerful, memorable film.  The supporting cast includes Lena Nyman (Helena), Gunnar Bjornstrand (Paul), Erland Josephson (Josef) and Linn Ullmann (Eva as a child).  An intelligent, thought provoking and emotionally wrenching film, highlighted by outstanding performances and beautifully photographed by Sven Nykvist, ""Autumn Sonata"" is an example of filmmaking at it's best; it's a lasting tribute, not only to the immense talents of Ingmar Bergman and Liv Ullmann, but to Ingrid Bergman, one of the most beautiful and gifted actresses ever to grace the silver screen.",5,"Dynamic, Memorable Film",983232000,"02 27, 2001",2001,4105,"['Writer/director', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'strained', 'relationship', 'mother', 'daughter', 'Autumn', 'Sonata', 'starring', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'Liv', 'Ullmann', 'Eva', 'Ullmann', 'not', 'seen', 'mother', 'Charlotte', 'Bergman', 'seven', 'years', 'successful', 'concert', 'pianist', 'Charlotte', 'spent', 'good', 'portion', 'life', 'road', 'losing', 'long-time', 'companion', 'Leonardo', 'Eva', 'come', 'parsonage', 'where', 'minister', 'husband', 'Viktor', 'Halvar', 'Bjork', 'live', 'extended', 'visit', 'Charlotte', 'soon', 'arrival', 'old', 'wounds', 'feelings', 'begin', 'surface', 'film', 'intimate', 'character', 'study', 'life-long', 'dysfunctional', 'relationship', 'Charlotte', 'Eva', 'director', 'Bergman', 'intricately', 'causes', 'effects', 'passed', 'lives', 'in-depth', 'look', 'emotional', 'damage', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'capable', 'inflicting', 'one', 'how', 'fragile', 'line', 'love', 'hate', 'becomes', 'when', 'subjected', 'incessant', 'neglect', 'even', 'one', 'parties', 'involved', 'story', 'unfolds', 'principals', 'bare', 'souls', 'last', 'revealing', 'lifetime', 'worth', 'repressed', 'feelings', 'emotionally', 'devastating', 'experience', 'audience', 'as', 'well', 'much', 'contained', 'dynamics', 'situation', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'identify', 'relate', 'own', 'lives', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'Master', 'presenting', 'life', 'reality', 'portraying', 'screen', 'domain', 'career', 'veritably', 'created', 'almost', 'genre', 'own', 'doing', 'so', 'microscope', 'own', 'design', 'basic', 'instincts', 'human', 'condition', 'what', 'people', 'tick', 'how', 'why', 'relate', 'one', 'do', 'Much', 'what', 'startling', 'always', 'emotionally', 'involving', 'so', 'deeply', 'succinctly', 'heart', 'matter', 'so', 'superlatively', 'film', 'methods', 'style', 'are', 'unique', 'talent', 'unequivocal', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'attempted', 'capture', 'essence', 'Bergman', 'perfected', 'few', 'have', 'succeeded', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'Liv', 'Ullmann', 'one', 'who', 'director', 'probably', 'come', 'closest', 'achieving', 'classic', 'sense', 'Bergman', 'films', 'Private', 'Confessions', 'Faithless', 'were', 'written', 'Bergman', 'role', 'Eva', 'Ullmann', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'career', 'should', 'have', 'least', 'been', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'was', 'not', 'nothing', 'less', 'gross', 'injustice', 'so', 'skillfully', 'conveys', 'depth', 'complexities', 'character', 'differing', 'emotional', 'levels', 'Eva', 'subjected', 'lasting', 'impression', 'someone', 'whom', 'easy', 'audience', 'sympathize', 'realize', 'reflection', 'what', 'truly', 'gifted', 'actress', 'Ullmann', 'as', 'good', 'Ullmann', 'performance', 'here', 'equaled', 'not', 'would', 'say', 'surpassed', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'portrayal', 'final', 'theatrical', 'appearance', 'Charlotte', 'renewal', 'faith', 'justice', 'world', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Actress', 'retrospect', 'somehow', 'inevitable', 'two', 'Bergmans', 'came', 'together', 'last', 'somewhat', 'lamentable', 'career', 'paths', 'did', 'not', 'cross', 'sooner', 'consolation', 'however', 'fact', 'when', 'did', 'finally', 'join', 'forces', 'result', 'was', 'such', 'powerful', 'memorable', 'film', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Lena', 'Nyman', 'Helena', 'Gunnar', 'Bjornstrand', 'Paul', 'Erland', 'Josephson', 'Josef', 'Linn', 'Ullmann', 'Eva', 'child', 'intelligent', 'thought', 'provoking', 'emotionally', 'wrenching', 'film', 'highlighted', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'Sven', 'Nykvist', 'Autumn', 'Sonata', 'example', 'filmmaking', 'best', 'lasting', 'tribute', 'not', 'only', 'immense', 'talents', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'Liv', 'Ullmann', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'gifted', 'actresses', 'ever', 'grace', 'silver', 'screen']",N/A

The daughter[s] have been irreparably damaged by a mother too busy with her work and herself, to love her daughters.  At the same time the Ingrid Bergman character gives a hint at the basic problem.  She herself can't remember being touched by her mother--very Germanic/Scandinavian.  The mother [Bergan] is incapable of love and therefore was incapable of really loving her daughters.Predictably the Liv Ulman character is equally empty and knows it.  She hates her mother for it but sees herself in her mother.  Both experience the depths of guilt but Ulman, in the very last scenes, makes the ultimate effort to forgive her mother--as she always has--and thereby save herself.I think the movie works because of the extraordinarily delicate exposure of things working in us all.
