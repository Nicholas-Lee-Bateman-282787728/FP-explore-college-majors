870132,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B0006J27XI,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[5, 5]","Nominated for 17 Emmys in its short four-year run, Soap premiered in the Fall of 1977 as one of the most controversial shows in American television history (and all before a single episode ever aired). The show was opposed by many groups who thought its subject matter would be too mature for a prime-time audience. But Soap never overstepped its bounds, and the show became an instant smash hit with its brilliant and satirical spoofs of classic daytime programming. Sporting an all-star cast and talented producers, the show spawned successful spin-off Benson in 1979, a series that launched Robert Guillaume's career to a whole new level...Set in suburban Connecticut, Soap follows the lives of two sisters - Jessica Tate (Katherine Helmond), a wealthy yet dim elitist, and Mary Campbell (Cathryn Damon), a housewife in a more traditional blue-collar atmosphere. But regardless of their social station in life, neither woman manages to escape the scandal and intrigue surrounding a typical soap opera family. Jessica's daughter Corrine (Diana Canova) is smitten with a priest, yet they are both having an affair with the same tennis pro. Meanwhile, Jessica and her husband Chester (Robert Mandan) incessantly cheat on one another. As for the other side of the family, Mary's husband Burt (Richard Mulligan) is certifiably insane, her son Danny (Ted Wass) is a mobster, stepson Jodie (Billy Crystal) is an out-of-the-closet homosexual, and all of them are caught up in a family filled with promiscuous infidelities and quite possibly murder! Throw in the insubordinate and sarcastic Tate butler Benson (Guillaume), and Soap holds its own as one of the funniest sitcoms in TV history...The Soap (Season 3) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere in which Burt awakens in the hull of a spaceship. Eunice asks Dutch to strike a deal with the feds, and Benson organizes a posse to rescue Billy from the Sunnies while an alien clone of Burt takes the real Burt's place... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include Episode 52 in which the real Burt and his alien clone finally confront one another, and Episode 69 in which, with a guilty Chester by her bedside, Jessica dies, all while Jodie gives an impassioned courtroom defense of his right to be an openly gay single parent...The DVD Report",5,Absolutely hilarious!,1114646400,"04 28, 2005",2005,2327,"['Nominated', '17', 'Emmys', 'short', 'four-year', 'run', 'Soap', 'premiered', 'Fall', '1977', 'one', 'most', 'controversial', 'shows', 'American', 'television', 'history', 'single', 'episode', 'ever', 'aired', 'show', 'was', 'opposed', 'many', 'groups', 'who', 'thought', 'subject', 'matter', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'mature', 'prime-time', 'audience', 'Soap', 'never', 'overstepped', 'bounds', 'show', 'became', 'instant', 'smash', 'hit', 'brilliant', 'satirical', 'spoofs', 'classic', 'daytime', 'programming', 'Sporting', 'all-star', 'cast', 'talented', 'producers', 'show', 'spawned', 'successful', 'spin-off', 'Benson', '1979', 'series', 'launched', 'Robert', 'Guillaume', 'career', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'Set', 'suburban', 'Connecticut', 'Soap', 'lives', 'two', 'sisters', 'Jessica', 'Tate', 'Katherine', 'Helmond', 'wealthy', 'yet', 'dim', 'elitist', 'Mary', 'Campbell', 'Cathryn', 'Damon', 'housewife', 'more', 'traditional', 'blue-collar', 'atmosphere', 'regardless', 'social', 'station', 'life', 'woman', 'escape', 'scandal', 'intrigue', 'surrounding', 'typical', 'soap', 'opera', 'family', 'Jessica', 'daughter', 'Corrine', 'Diana', 'Canova', 'smitten', 'priest', 'yet', 'are', 'having', 'affair', 'same', 'tennis', 'pro', 'Meanwhile', 'Jessica', 'husband', 'Chester', 'Robert', 'Mandan', 'incessantly', 'cheat', 'one', 'other', 'side', 'family', 'Mary', 'husband', 'Burt', 'Richard', 'Mulligan', 'certifiably', 'insane', 'son', 'Danny', 'Ted', 'Wass', 'mobster', 'stepson', 'Jodie', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'out-of-the-closet', 'homosexual', 'are', 'caught', 'up', 'family', 'filled', 'promiscuous', 'infidelities', 'quite', 'possibly', 'murder', 'Throw', 'insubordinate', 'sarcastic', 'Tate', 'butler', 'Benson', 'Guillaume', 'Soap', 'own', 'one', 'funniest', 'sitcoms', 'TV', 'history', 'Soap', 'Season', '3', 'DVD', 'number', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Burt', 'hull', 'spaceship', 'Eunice', 'Dutch', 'strike', 'deal', 'feds', 'Benson', 'posse', 'rescue', 'Billy', 'Sunnies', 'alien', 'clone', 'Burt', 'real', 'Burt', 'place', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '3', 'include', 'Episode', '52', 'real', 'Burt', 'alien', 'clone', 'finally', 'one', 'Episode', '69', 'guilty', 'Chester', 'bedside', 'Jessica', 'Jodie', 'impassioned', 'courtroom', 'defense', 'right', 'be', 'openly', 'gay', 'single', 'parent', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

870136,A2MZ1VBYTQ7MO5,B0006J27XI,Joseph Haggard Jr.,"[13, 15]","After starting off with two uproarious seasons, ""Soap"" continued to bring in the laughs with the third season. However after the first few episodes of season three, the show lost one of their main cast members. Robert Guillaume, who stole scene after scene in the first two seasons as Benson, left ""Soap"" to star in his own spin-off series titled (appropriately enough) ""Benson"". Certainly it was great to see Guillaume get his own show (and deservedly so), but in the process ""Soap"" lost a little of its comic touch without him. Nevertheless, the show for the most part continued to be very funny throughout season three. I just thought that the first two seasons were much funnier. Most of the other regular cast members returned, and two of the actors were honored with Emmy Awards for their work. Richard Mulligan and Cathryn Damon (as Burt and Mary Campbell) won lead acting Emmys in 1980 for their roles on the show. It was nice that ""Soap"" got a little bit of Emmy recognition in the four years that it aired. The year before in 1979, Robert Guillaume won a supporting Emmy for his role as Benson on ""Soap"" just as he was departing for ""Benson"" (Guillaume would eventually win another Emmy as a lead actor for ""Benson"" in 1985). ""Soap"" deserved the awards it got. It's too bad it didn't win more awards.

Five short space aliens enter the examining room.  One of them becomes quiet excited at the prospect of becoming Burt's double and filling in for him back on Earth.Campbell's living room (night) - The doorbell rings.  Mary, Burt's wife, opens the door and an excited Burt enters.  Mary's mind is on eating dinner; alien Burt's mind is on ...

After Benson left in episode 3, a very poignant farewell, it's days were unfortunately numbered. Jay Sandrich was a masterful director, and the episodes after he departed (starting with episode 7), completely failed to hold my interest. JD Lobue simply didn't have the creativity or grounded sense of humor and the timing that's so critical to accomplish a believable storyline. The scenarios became more ludicrous and silly (not in the positive way as before) and barely chuckle worthy. The first two seasons repeatedly had me howling with laughter and on the  verge of tears within mere minutes of each other, mainly due to Mr. Sandrich's brilliance. A lot of people consider season 4 the undoing of this comedic gem, but for me, 6 episodes into season 3 I was ready to wash my hands of it. It's worth buying though, just to see those  episodes.

870150,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0006J27XI,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[39, 41]","Continuing to break new ground, Soap dived right into a number of new issues for this comedy series. The plot lines continued to be ""out there"" as Burt (Richard Mulligan) is abducted by aliens and tries to escape. On Earth Burt has been replaced by an alien who acts even stranger than before. The only one to notice is, of course, his wife Mary. Benson (Robert Guillaume who would soon star in his own spin-off playing his popular character) saves Billy (Jimmy Baio) from a cult and finally Jodie the first gay character portrayed positively on TV finds out he has a baby daughter from an affair Jodie had with a woman. In other words, all's wrong in the world of Soap which is exactly as it should be.Improving on the first two sets Soap: The Complete Third Season looks positively robust by comparison to the first two sets. With better clarity, image quality, sharper and better color reproduction, this set shows that Columbia Tristar spend the bulk of the marketing funds to make the series look as rich as possible for this DVD release. While there are still analog imperfections (and what could you expect of a series videotaped over twenty years ago?), the show looks the best it ever has on DVD. Likewise, the sound also comes across with better presence than the previous set although it is muffled on a couple of episodes throughout this three disc set. Overall, CTHE have done an exceptional job of improving the video and audio quality of this series over seasons one and two.As I said, it's clear that most of the budget went to improving the video and audio of the series which would explain the complete lack of extras.  The only extras we get here are previews for other CTHE releases. My memory isn't always the best but it does appear as if the episodes presented here are (for the most part) uncut when compared to the syndicated episodes. What about vintage interviews that CTHE might have in the vaults for future sets?This is the one area where Columbia could have improved the series. Having Susan Harris, Katherine Helmond or Billy Crystal do a commentary track would have boosted the sales of this set for fans that have recorded it off TV over the years. Again, I'm sure it was a budget issue.Overall, a fine job from Columbia on preparing this release for DVD. Sure it could always be better but keep in mind that the studio has to work with the budget for each set their given. It's clear that most of that budget went to improving the video and audio of the series. Does it look stellar? No but it would be difficult to improve this beyond what we see here.",4,Bubbly and entertaining improved over last 2 sets,1107648000,"02 6, 2005",2005,2588,"['Continuing', 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'Soap', 'dived', 'right', 'number', 'new', 'issues', 'comedy', 'series', 'plot', 'lines', 'continued', 'be', 'there', 'Burt', 'Richard', 'Mulligan', 'abducted', 'aliens', 'tries', 'escape', 'Earth', 'Burt', 'been', 'replaced', 'alien', 'who', 'even', 'stranger', 'before', 'only', 'one', 'notice', 'course', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Benson', 'Robert', 'Guillaume', 'who', 'would', 'soon', 'star', 'own', 'spin-off', 'playing', 'popular', 'character', 'Billy', 'Jimmy', 'Baio', 'cult', 'finally', 'Jodie', 'first', 'gay', 'character', 'portrayed', 'positively', 'TV', 'finds', 'out', 'baby', 'daughter', 'affair', 'Jodie', 'had', 'woman', 'other', 'words', 'wrong', 'world', 'Soap', 'exactly', 'should', 'be.Improving', 'first', 'two', 'sets', 'Soap', 'Complete', 'Third', 'Season', 'positively', 'robust', 'comparison', 'first', 'two', 'sets', 'better', 'clarity', 'image', 'quality', 'sharper', 'better', 'color', 'reproduction', 'set', 'Columbia', 'Tristar', 'spend', 'bulk', 'marketing', 'funds', 'make', 'series', 'look', 'rich', 'possible', 'DVD', 'release', 'are', 'still', 'analog', 'imperfections', 'what', 'could', 'expect', 'series', 'videotaped', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'show', 'best', 'ever', 'DVD', 'Likewise', 'sound', 'also', 'better', 'presence', 'previous', 'set', 'muffled', 'couple', 'episodes', 'three', 'disc', 'set', 'Overall', 'CTHE', 'have', 'done', 'exceptional', 'job', 'improving', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'series', 'seasons', 'one', 'two.As', 'said', 'clear', 'most', 'budget', 'went', 'improving', 'video', 'audio', 'series', 'would', 'explain', 'complete', 'lack', 'extras', 'only', 'extras', 'get', 'here', 'are', 'previews', 'other', 'CTHE', 'releases', 'memory', ""n't"", 'always', 'best', 'appear', 'episodes', 'presented', 'here', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'uncut', 'when', 'compared', 'syndicated', 'episodes', 'What', 'vintage', 'interviews', 'CTHE', 'might', 'have', 'vaults', 'future', 'sets', 'one', 'area', 'where', 'Columbia', 'could', 'have', 'improved', 'series', 'Having', 'Susan', 'Harris', 'Katherine', 'Helmond', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'do', 'commentary', 'track', 'would', 'have', 'boosted', 'sales', 'set', 'fans', 'have', 'recorded', 'off', 'TV', 'years', 'Again', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'budget', 'issue.Overall', 'fine', 'job', 'Columbia', 'preparing', 'release', 'DVD', 'Sure', 'could', 'always', 'be', 'better', 'keep', 'mind', 'studio', 'work', 'budget', 'set', 'given', 'clear', 'most', 'budget', 'went', 'improving', 'video', 'audio', 'series', 'look', 'stellar', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'improve', 'what', 'see', 'here']",N/A
