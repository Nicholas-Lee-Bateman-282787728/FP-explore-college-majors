I came into this show in the middle of season 2 and it was because of Sheldon that I bought Season 1 and Season 2 -to catch up with what I missed. Now I just want to own it, because everything on tv is so stupid now, it is worth buying the good stuff so that one has proof that someone had a good idea at least once or twice during this age of bad tv and ridiculous reality shows.Season 3 brings us back with the gang in Pasadena California.  3 Phd's, one MA and Penny.  There is so much going on in this show, the things they say are so funny.  But the friendship is really great, they have their clique and they are cool in their own way.  Honestly, the show would not survive without Walowitz and Sheldon.  I just love how those two characters are just complete polar opposites, Walowitz being a total girl crazy horndog, and Sheldon being totally sexually ambivilent and sexually ambiguous. His OCD is hilarious.  I also love the mothers, Laurie Metcaf as Sheldon's mom and (I cant recall her name) as Leonard's mom.

There still are some interesting places for the characters to go, so I'm curious as to how the writers will handle this. The series finale hinted at a possible romantic relationship for Sheldon, which should be interesting in several dimensions.Now I think the writers need to give Penny more to do- we know she's from Nebraska and has a brother, but beyond that there's not much background. What's her last name? We've seen (or heard) the other characters' parents- what are Penny's parents like? It would be fun to see Penny finally get some modeling or acting work. If I were one of the show's writers, I would put together an episode or two where Penny gets a bit part in a low budget sci-fi movie, and the guys overwhelm her with suggestions on costume and lines and keeping the science real.Anyway, TBBT is one of my favorite shows, and I'm hoping for a great 4th season.",4,3 seasons and still a good show,1275177600,"05 30, 2010",2010,931,"[""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'getting', '3rd', 'season', 'DVD', 'still', 'are', 'interesting', 'places', 'characters', 'go', ""'m"", 'curious', 'how', 'writers', 'will', 'handle', 'series', 'finale', 'hinted', 'possible', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Sheldon', 'should', 'be', 'interesting', 'several', 'dimensions.Now', 'think', 'writers', 'need', 'give', 'Penny', 'more', 'do-', 'know', 'Nebraska', 'brother', 'not', 'much', 'background', 'What', 'last', 'name', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'heard', 'other', 'characters', 'parents-', 'what', 'are', 'Penny', 'parents', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'see', 'Penny', 'finally', 'get', 'modeling', 'acting', 'work', 'were', 'one', 'show', 'writers', 'would', 'put', 'together', 'episode', 'two', 'where', 'Penny', 'bit', 'part', 'low', 'budget', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'guys', 'suggestions', 'costume', 'lines', 'keeping', 'science', 'real.Anyway', 'TBBT', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'great', '4th', 'season']",N/A

This show is, without a doubt, the highlight of my television viewing each week.  All of the characters are so intelligently developed and the characters always stay true to themselves.  Season three has been the best so far. In this age of mediocrity, it is a tribute to the writers how this program keeps its freshness and comedy alive.  My favorite season 3 moment was Sheldon's acceptance speech for a prestigious physics award.  Taking a page from Raj's playbook, Sheldon conquered his stagefright by becoming inebriated, albeit inadvertently.  I loved his joke about the chicken and the mobius strip.  It was a riot, even though I later had to have a friend explain to me why it was funny. Okay, so I never took calculus!!!

Taylor ""GFT""","[1, 1]","THE BIG BANG THEORY was a failed pilot until creators Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady re-wrote the script to take advantage of the chemistry between lead actors Jim Parsons and Johnny Galecki. The series went on the air in 2007 and quickly became a national favorite. Most comedies traffic in stereotypes and this series is no different, centering on a group of socially inept geniuses who run afoul of the pretty but intellectually average girl who lives across the hall--but the fun of the series is in the way it undercuts the stereotypes, giving us glimpses of humor and humanity in unexpected and often laugh-out-loud ways.Season Two ended with Sheldon (Jim Parsons), Leonard (Johnny Galecki), Howard (Simon Helberg) and Raj (Kunal Nayyar) conducting an experiement at the north pole for three months--and on their return Penny (Kaley Cuoco) pounces on Leonard.  Their evolving relationship forms a running thread through Season Three, but it is not the only one.  Somewhat against her will, Penny sets up hyper-sleazy Howard with her friend Bernadette (Melissa Rauch), and in the last episode of the season Howard and Raj trap Sheldon into a computer-arranged date with Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik.)  Both Rauch and Bialik are wickedly funny and add tremendously to the fun.  There are also guest appearances by Wil Wheaton as himself, Laurie Metcalf as Mrs. Cooper, and Christine Baranski as Dr. Beverly Hofstadter.  All of the episodes are fun, but my own favorite is ""The Adhesive Duck Deficiency.""  While the other men are on a camping trip that really trips, Penny slips in her shower and Sheldon is forced to dress her, drive her, and get her through Emergency Room hell.  It's all tremendous fun.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",5,Season Three is a Knock-Out,1395792000,"03 26, 2014",2014,1728,"['BIG', 'BANG', 'THEORY', 'was', 'failed', 'pilot', 'creators', 'Chuck', 'Lorre', 'Bill', 'Prady', 're-wrote', 'script', 'take', 'advantage', 'chemistry', 'lead', 'actors', 'Jim', 'Parsons', 'Johnny', 'Galecki', 'series', 'went', 'air', '2007', 'quickly', 'became', 'national', 'favorite', 'Most', 'comedies', 'traffic', 'stereotypes', 'series', 'different', 'centering', 'group', 'socially', 'inept', 'geniuses', 'who', 'run', 'afoul', 'pretty', 'intellectually', 'average', 'girl', 'who', 'hall', 'fun', 'series', 'way', 'stereotypes', 'giving', 'glimpses', 'humor', 'humanity', 'unexpected', 'often', 'laugh-out-loud', 'ways.Season', 'Two', 'ended', 'Sheldon', 'Jim', 'Parsons', 'Leonard', 'Johnny', 'Galecki', 'Howard', 'Simon', 'Helberg', 'Raj', 'Kunal', 'Nayyar', 'conducting', 'experiement', 'north', 'pole', 'three', 'months', 'return', 'Penny', 'Kaley', 'Cuoco', 'pounces', 'Leonard', 'evolving', 'relationship', 'running', 'thread', 'Season', 'Three', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'Somewhat', 'will', 'Penny', 'up', 'hyper-sleazy', 'Howard', 'friend', 'Bernadette', 'Melissa', 'Rauch', 'last', 'episode', 'season', 'Howard', 'Raj', 'trap', 'Sheldon', 'computer-arranged', 'date', 'Amy', 'Farrah', 'Fowler', 'Mayim', 'Bialik', 'Rauch', 'Bialik', 'are', 'wickedly', 'funny', 'add', 'tremendously', 'fun', 'are', 'also', 'guest', 'appearances', 'Wil', 'Wheaton', 'Laurie', 'Metcalf', 'Mrs.', 'Cooper', 'Christine', 'Baranski', 'Dr.', 'Beverly', 'Hofstadter', 'episodes', 'are', 'fun', 'own', 'favorite', 'Adhesive', 'Duck', 'Deficiency', 'other', 'men', 'are', 'camping', 'trip', 'really', 'Penny', 'shower', 'Sheldon', 'forced', 'dress', 'drive', 'get', 'Emergency', 'Room', 'hell', 'tremendous', 'fun.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

By finally getting Penny and Leonard into a relationship, only to discover they essentially don't speak the same language, they opened up new character avenues where lesser series have shut them down.  And, after focusing on Sheldon and Leonard for two years, the writers finally give some intriguing face-time to Raj and Howard, who no longer have to be the others' wing men.On the other hand, I appreciated in the prior seasons that the writers didn't rely on ""situations"" do carry the episodes' momentum.  This year they have a lot more schtick driving them.  I can almost hear the writers' room discussions: ""What if we got Leonard and the boys stoned?""  ""You know what we really need?  A flashback episode.""  ""Is there any way we can get Wil Wheaton back for one more episode?""I like plenty from this season.  The rapid swings Leonard and Penny endure show hidden depths in their characters.  Sheldon's extravagant idiosyncrasies continue to provide well-earned laughs.

She loaned me the first two seasons on dvd and I inhaled them. The cast is wonderful, the acting is good (Jim Parsons!!!!!)and the writing is excellent. It's such a breath of fresh air to see a show about a group of very smart people whose differences are celebrated. In today's world, describing yourself as an ""intellectual"" and as not religious or (the horror) as an atheist is comparable to being a puppy killer. I love that this group of people are smarty-pants and proud of it. I like their acceptance and affection for Penny, who isn't their intellectual equal, but often has much more common sense than they do. Sheldon is my favorite character. I particularly enjoy his relationship with Penny and how he learns that being a genius doesn't always make you the smartest person in the room.

I had not laughed out loud this hard ever since the best days of FRASIER and SEINFELD - and BIG BANG is consistently brilliant!Sheldon Cooper is unavoidably the king of the show - the massive black hole this Universe revolves around if you will. A child prodigy, now a 24 years old theoretical physicist PhD with absolutely no social skills or known sexual drive. Sheldon may be on the verge of unifying the fields but cannot drive a car to save his life or break a smile even remotely resembling that of a mere homo sapiens.Best SEASON 3 moment (a very hard choice to make): attempting to condition Penny using positive reinforcement (chocolates) - but was also open to ""mild electric-shocks with almost imperceptible tissue damage"" to have her ready by dinner-time.Leonard Hofstadter is Sheldon's roommate and primary ...keeper. An experimental physicist himself, he juggles Sheldon's idiosyncrasies with his personal neurosis - not to mention his crush on his neighbor Penny.Best SEASON 3 moment: getting high on hash-cookies while on an asteroid-gazing camp-trip and rambling that he 'd rather have a different name as Leonard sounds like having ""nerd"" in it.Howard Wolowitz is the only one with no PhD yet (and Sheldon never lets him forget it). An electrical engineer whose crowning achievement is a mechanized arm that is used in the space shuttle (and is now working on its liquid waste management solutions). The fact that he is a short man with a severely outdated and misguided sense of fashion, still lives with his mother, insists on using a collection of pickup lines straight from men's magazines advice columns - and yet carries himself as God's gift to women is just hilarious.Best SEASON 3 moment: turning into Gothowitz by use of fake tattoo-sleeves to pick up ""easy morbid Goth girls"".Rajesh Koothrappali is a particle astrophysicist with a fashion sense close to absolute zero and a severe case of shyness - to the point that he cannot speak in front of women unless inebriated. He keeps using the ""poor Indian"" defense although his father is a rich doctor who drives a Bentley.Best SEASON 3 moment: wearing a T-shirt with a small speaker and a large selection of sound-effects, he uses it brilliantly to dramatize his answers. HOWARD: ""But Sheldon, you ARE guilty"". RAJEH: ""[playing the Law & Order Doom-DOOM]!""Finally, Penny. She is the proverbial good girl next door who came to California with stardom aspirations but so far works as waitress and suffers a sequence of bad boyfriends - and from her neighbors.Best SEASON 3 moment: waiting at the hospital with Sheldon taking her medical history. ""Migraines?"" ""Well, I'm getting one now!""The show unavoidably makes use of previous sitcom combinations (the odd couple, the unfulfilled love-interest mismatch) but even if one manages to discern them they are used in such a fresh manner that all that is left is great entertainment!The way to truly enjoy this is to own it on DVD. The writing is so smart and the jokes fly so fast (many of them non-verbal) there is just no way to savor it during its weekly air time. Well, may be Sheldon could but then again, who can compare his intellect with his?HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",5,A WHOLE NEW UNIVERSE OF INTELLIGENT LAUGHS!,1267747200,"03 5, 2010",2010,3398,"['cult', 'tradition', 'SPARTACUS', 'halls', 'science', 'department', 'now', 'AM', 'SHELDON', 'Well', 'third', 'season', 'THE', 'BIG', 'BANG', 'THEORY', 'proved', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'funny', 'TV', 'sitcoms', 'ever', 'aired', 'had', 'not', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'hard', 'ever', 'best', 'days', 'FRASIER', 'SEINFELD', 'BIG', 'BANG', 'consistently', 'brilliant', 'Sheldon', 'Cooper', 'unavoidably', 'king', 'show', 'massive', 'black', 'hole', 'Universe', 'will', 'child', 'prodigy', 'now', '24', 'years', 'old', 'theoretical', 'physicist', 'PhD', 'absolutely', 'social', 'skills', 'known', 'sexual', 'drive', 'Sheldon', 'may', 'be', 'verge', 'unifying', 'fields', 'can', 'not', 'drive', 'car', 'save', 'life', 'break', 'smile', 'even', 'remotely', 'resembling', 'mere', 'homo', 'sapiens.Best', 'SEASON', '3', 'moment', 'very', 'hard', 'choice', 'make', 'attempting', 'condition', 'Penny', 'using', 'positive', 'reinforcement', 'chocolates', 'was', 'also', 'open', 'mild', 'electric-shocks', 'almost', 'imperceptible', 'tissue', 'damage', 'have', 'ready', 'dinner-time.Leonard', 'Hofstadter', 'Sheldon', 'roommate', 'primary', 'keeper', 'experimental', 'physicist', 'Sheldon', 'idiosyncrasies', 'personal', 'neurosis', 'not', 'mention', 'crush', 'neighbor', 'Penny.Best', 'SEASON', '3', 'moment', 'getting', 'high', 'hash-cookies', 'asteroid-gazing', 'camp-trip', 'rambling', ""'d"", 'rather', 'have', 'different', 'name', 'Leonard', 'having', 'nerd', 'it.Howard', 'Wolowitz', 'only', 'one', 'PhD', 'yet', 'Sheldon', 'never', 'forget', 'electrical', 'engineer', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'mechanized', 'arm', 'used', 'space', 'shuttle', 'now', 'working', 'liquid', 'waste', 'management', 'solutions', 'fact', 'short', 'man', 'severely', 'outdated', 'misguided', 'sense', 'fashion', 'still', 'mother', 'using', 'collection', 'pickup', 'lines', 'straight', 'men', 'magazines', 'advice', 'columns', 'yet', 'God', 'gift', 'women', 'just', 'hilarious.Best', 'SEASON', '3', 'moment', 'turning', 'Gothowitz', 'use', 'fake', 'tattoo-sleeves', 'pick', 'up', 'easy', 'morbid', 'Goth', 'girls', '.Rajesh', 'Koothrappali', 'particle', 'astrophysicist', 'fashion', 'sense', 'close', 'absolute', 'zero', 'severe', 'case', 'shyness', 'point', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'front', 'women', 'inebriated', 'using', 'poor', 'Indian', 'defense', 'father', 'rich', 'doctor', 'who', 'Bentley.Best', 'SEASON', '3', 'moment', 'wearing', 'T-shirt', 'small', 'speaker', 'large', 'selection', 'sound-effects', 'brilliantly', 'dramatize', 'answers', 'HOWARD', 'Sheldon', 'ARE', 'guilty', 'RAJEH', 'playing', 'Law', 'Order', 'Doom-DOOM', ']', 'Finally', 'Penny', 'proverbial', 'good', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'who', 'came', 'California', 'stardom', 'aspirations', 'so', 'far', 'waitress', 'sequence', 'bad', 'boyfriends', 'neighbors.Best', 'SEASON', '3', 'moment', 'waiting', 'hospital', 'Sheldon', 'taking', 'medical', 'history', 'Migraines', 'Well', ""'m"", 'getting', 'one', 'now', 'show', 'unavoidably', 'use', 'previous', 'sitcom', 'combinations', 'odd', 'couple', 'unfulfilled', 'love-interest', 'mismatch', 'even', 'one', 'discern', 'are', 'used', 'such', 'fresh', 'manner', 'left', 'great', 'entertainment', 'way', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'own', 'DVD', 'writing', 'so', 'smart', 'jokes', 'fly', 'so', 'fast', 'many', 'non-verbal', 'just', 'way', 'savor', 'weekly', 'air', 'time', 'Well', 'may', 'be', 'Sheldon', 'could', 'then', 'again', 'who', 'can', 'compare', 'intellect', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",N/A
1279089,A1AST89AHN17O7,B002N5N4M6,Omnes,"[0, 0]","Starting as Leonard, Sheldon, Raj and Howard return from the North Pole, this DVD set show us the outcome of their trip as well as the beginning of what viewers expected for seasons: Penny and Leonard becoming a couple. Though they are still living in separate apartments located on the same floor, the seasons show the ups and downs of their relationship as well as the adjustments Sheldon has to do due to this new lifestyle.This season is definitely the beginning of changes in the character's storylines as Bernadette - Penny's colleague at ""The CheeseCake Factory"" - starts a relationship with Howard, while the last episode shows another woman who will become an important factor in Sheldon's life. During this season, the show does many references to Pop Culture such as ""The Lord of The Rings"", ""Star Trek"" and ""DC Comics"", but also offers excellent guest stars such as Stan Lee (whose entry on the set gives quite an ovation from the live audience), and Will Wheaton, whose appearance in two episodes will offer him many appearances in the next seasons as Sheldon holds a terrible grudge against the actor.Though I didn't get to mention this in the other reviews, the series's sound quality is great. However, I wish the series would offer, for the Dolby 5.1 sound system back speakers, more sound effects than the whizzing atoms in the intertitles and the music in the opening/ending credits. For instance, I would love it if the live audience laughters could be heard in the back speakers instead of the frontal Left/Right speakers. Of course, this is just a suggestion, but one that I wanted to give out.As for the show's episodes, my ten favourite were ""The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation"", ""The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary"", ""The Guitarist Amplification"", ""The Adhesive Duck Deficiency"", ""The Vengeance Formulation"", ""The Maternal Congruence"", ""The Einstein Approximation"", ""The Excelsior Acquisition"", ""The Spaghetti Catalyst"", and ""The Lunar Excitation"". As for my least favourite episode, I didn't like ""The Plimpton Stimulation"" because the story ends in mid-suspense and lacks a proper conclusion. Not only that, I wished the presence of the cosmological physicist had more of an impact to the guys' lives, more juice than finding out that she is a nymphomaniac and that she will have sex with Leonard and Raj. Maybe it would have been nice if her presence was more of a conflict and if she had been on the show at a time Leonard and Penny, or Howard and Bernadette, were dating. Personally, I felt the episode was just a filler that I can skip over in future viewings of this season.Nevertheless, this season's has enough excellent episodes to encourage viewers to watch another season of the Big Bang Theory, and for new viewers to discover this show.",5,"""Bazinga!"" - Sheldon Cooper",1354406400,"12 2, 2012",2012,2776,"['Starting', 'Leonard', 'Sheldon', 'Raj', 'Howard', 'return', 'North', 'Pole', 'DVD', 'set', 'show', 'outcome', 'trip', 'as', 'well', 'beginning', 'what', 'viewers', 'expected', 'seasons', 'Penny', 'Leonard', 'becoming', 'couple', 'are', 'still', 'living', 'separate', 'apartments', 'located', 'same', 'floor', 'seasons', 'show', 'ups', 'downs', 'relationship', 'as', 'well', 'adjustments', 'Sheldon', 'do', 'due', 'new', 'lifestyle.This', 'season', 'definitely', 'beginning', 'changes', 'character', 'storylines', 'Bernadette', 'Penny', 'colleague', 'CheeseCake', 'Factory', 'relationship', 'Howard', 'last', 'episode', 'woman', 'who', 'will', 'become', 'important', 'factor', 'Sheldon', 'life', 'season', 'show', 'many', 'references', 'Pop', 'Culture', 'such', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Star', 'Trek', 'DC', 'Comics', 'also', 'excellent', 'guest', 'stars', 'such', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'entry', 'set', 'quite', 'ovation', 'live', 'audience', 'Will', 'Wheaton', 'appearance', 'two', 'episodes', 'will', 'offer', 'many', 'appearances', 'next', 'seasons', 'Sheldon', 'terrible', 'grudge', 'actor.Though', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'mention', 'other', 'reviews', 'series', 'sound', 'quality', 'great', 'However', 'wish', 'series', 'would', 'offer', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'sound', 'system', 'back', 'speakers', 'more', 'sound', 'effects', 'whizzing', 'atoms', 'intertitles', 'music', 'opening/ending', 'credits', 'instance', 'would', 'love', 'live', 'audience', 'laughters', 'could', 'be', 'heard', 'back', 'speakers', 'instead', 'frontal', 'Left/Right', 'speakers', 'course', 'just', 'suggestion', 'one', 'wanted', 'give', 'out.As', 'show', 'episodes', 'ten', 'favourite', 'were', 'Electric', 'Can', 'Opener', 'Fluctuation', 'Creepy', 'Candy', 'Coating', 'Corollary', 'Guitarist', 'Amplification', 'Adhesive', 'Duck', 'Deficiency', 'Vengeance', 'Formulation', 'Maternal', 'Congruence', 'Einstein', 'Approximation', 'Excelsior', 'Acquisition', 'Spaghetti', 'Catalyst', 'Lunar', 'Excitation', 'least', 'favourite', 'episode', 'did', ""n't"", 'Plimpton', 'Stimulation', 'story', 'mid-suspense', 'proper', 'conclusion', 'Not', 'only', 'wished', 'presence', 'cosmological', 'physicist', 'had', 'more', 'impact', 'guys', 'lives', 'more', 'juice', 'finding', 'out', 'nymphomaniac', 'will', 'have', 'sex', 'Leonard', 'Raj', 'Maybe', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'presence', 'was', 'more', 'conflict', 'had', 'been', 'show', 'time', 'Leonard', 'Penny', 'Howard', 'Bernadette', 'were', 'dating', 'Personally', 'felt', 'episode', 'was', 'just', 'filler', 'can', 'skip', 'over', 'future', 'viewings', 'season.Nevertheless', 'season', 'enough', 'excellent', 'episodes', 'encourage', 'viewers', 'watch', 'season', 'Big', 'Bang', 'Theory', 'new', 'viewers', 'discover', 'show']",N/A

So after I watch BBT season 1-7.5 and Fraiser season 1-11 I see where the writers of the BBT are getting their inspiration for stories and characters. It has been pointed out that similarities in Sheldon/Niles Leonard/Fraiser. Lilith/Leslie and Amy. I can also see similarities in Roz and Penny. The Mother of Howard will never be seen just as the character Maris was not seen. The actress that plays Leonard's mom also had a small role on Fraiser playing a psychiatrist in the same dry attitude . In Fraiser Season 7 episode 16 there is a character named Chuck that acts and sounds like Barry Kripke.There was a nerd character on Fraiser that worked at the radio station that was obsessed with Star trek.  In season 9 of Fraiser there is a junior agent  episode 10 named Portia that is short, blond, and has a similar attitude, voice of Bernadette including the yelling tone when Bernadette imitates Howard's mother. I also noticed many story lines and story themes that were duplicated. I would not be surprised if the writers are watching all the episodes of Frasier to come up with more episodes of BBT. To name a few themes Annoying cricket, kite flying, check engine light comes on,  chess competitions, horrible basketball match, bullying, reconnecting with a former bully, quotes ""A cat can have kittens in the oven but that does not make them biscuits"",and the list goes on......So in conclusion I thought BBT was funny until I discovered the writers recycled many quotes and themes of Fraiser.

The third season picks up with the boys returning home from the North Pole and suddenly Leonard and Penny are in a relationship. Before you know it the show takes an amazing twist with a whole new bunch of challenges for our genius foursome as they tackle being in relationships, dating and of course trying to keep Sheldon under control through it all.This season brings us some great milestones, such as Howard meeting the cute Bernadette, Sheldon singing Soft Kitty to Penny and of course the battle between Sheldon and Will Wheaton. The stars never miss a beat in this season and of course our favorite guest stars make their triumphant returns including a special surprise at the very end of the season. Still, this show continues to make me laugh and I am quite impressed with how well this season turned out. If you have never seen this show before this season contains the one episode you must see.
