1091874,A38IXDI5371P7Z,B000TSJ02C,Angela,"[6, 6]","In the Trim and Tone Fast Video, Kimberly Spreen is upbeat and encouraging as she takes you through the 6 mix-and-match workouts to tone up the body. She doesn't make you jump around too much, but creates enough of an impact to keep your heart rate up, make you sweat, and burn off fat.I tend to comment on the ""pick and choose!"" workouts that I normally hate since most videos usually include seperate warm-ups. However, after pressing 'play all"" I was happy to see that it ran through everything without having to press the fast forward button once. On the video, running time is 60 min.My thighs and butt felt the burn more than anything else. She incorporates tons of squats and lunges both with and without weights, and I can guarantee that if you don't have good balance you might get frustrated at first. If you're looking for a great workout to tone up and sculpt, I highly reccommend this video to use at least two to three times a week for a low-impact workout. After opening Trim and Tone Fast today and after using it once, I can't wait to see my results after a few weeks!",5,"Once, again, I love SELF videos!",1211587200,"05 24, 2008",2008,1085,"['Trim', 'Tone', 'Fast', 'Video', 'Kimberly', 'Spreen', 'upbeat', 'encouraging', '6', 'mix-and-match', 'workouts', 'tone', 'up', 'body', ""n't"", 'make', 'jump', 'around', 'too', 'much', 'enough', 'impact', 'keep', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'make', 'sweat', 'burn', 'off', 'fat.I', 'tend', 'comment', 'pick', 'choose', 'normally', 'hate', 'most', 'videos', 'usually', 'include', 'seperate', 'warm-ups', 'However', 'pressing', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'ran', 'everything', 'having', 'press', 'fast', 'forward', 'button', 'once', 'video', 'running', 'time', '60', 'min.My', 'thighs', 'butt', 'felt', 'burn', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'tons', 'squats', 'weights', 'can', 'guarantee', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'good', 'balance', 'might', 'get', 'frustrated', 'first', ""'re"", 'looking', 'great', 'workout', 'tone', 'up', 'sculpt', 'highly', 'reccommend', 'video', 'use', 'least', 'two', 'three', 'times', 'week', 'low-impact', 'workout', 'opening', 'Trim', 'Tone', 'Fast', 'today', 'using', 'once', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'results', 'few', 'weeks']",SELF - Trim & Tone Fast!

This is another of those ""do it all"" or ""mix and match"" DVD's.  You can do one, some, or all of the following segments (times are approximate):  5-minute warm up; 5-6 minutes leg exercises, includes lunges; 5-6 minutes back work, including rows; 5-6 minutes shoulder and arm work, including biceps and triceps; 5-6 minutes chest work, including chest presses; , 5-6 minutes core work; a 15-16 minute Full Body workout; 5-minute cool down.  I chose ""do it all"" for my first time, but I will skip the ""full body workout"" next time because I was totally fried by the individual segments!  Kimberly puts her own spin on some familiar moves, and she is so friendly about doing it!

I didn't once break a sweat or find any of the targeted area toning to be challenging, however the all over body toning was a great piece.  I will probably just do that section along with cardio from another DVD next time.  I would recomment Self Bikini Body over this one, as that one is continuous, where this one is broken up, so plenty of down time in between segments.",4,Good for beginners,1239321600,"04 10, 2009",2009,430,"['found', 'be', 'more', 'beginner', 'level', 'toning', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'once', 'break', 'sweat', 'find', 'targeted', 'area', 'toning', 'be', 'challenging', 'however', 'body', 'toning', 'was', 'great', 'piece', 'will', 'probably', 'just', 'do', 'section', 'cardio', 'DVD', 'next', 'time', 'would', 'recomment', 'Self', 'Bikini', 'Body', 'one', 'one', 'continuous', 'where', 'one', 'broken', 'up', 'plenty', 'down', 'time', 'segments']",SELF - Trim & Tone Fast!
1091877,A2DHB7PT7Q9Q6H,B000TSJ02C,Kelly A. Daly,"[12, 12]","This is a great DVD where you can mix and match all the different segments.  You'll get a good workout if you do the 3 upper body sections.  There are familiar exercises but Kimberly makes it interesting with tempo changes and different combinations.  The core section is short but tough with ""v"" sit-ups, leg drops and a few crunches.  The leg section is all standing with lunges, squats and plie combos.  I would've preferred this section to be longer and include some floorwork.  In the 15 minute total body section you'll work upper and lower body at the same time doing squats and lunges with a few bicep curls but mostly shoulder work. The last few minutes you'll do chest flies in v sit position then some plank exercises. The pace of the workout is good.  I used 5 lb. weights for the individual sections and was sore the next day.  For total body, I had to go lighter with the weights because of all the shoulder work.  Kimberly is a friendly, soft spoken instructor.  She reminds me of Tamilee Webb.  The outdoor scenery with mountains in the back was a nice change.",4,Good Intermediate Workout,1199923200,"01 10, 2008",2008,1076,"['great', 'DVD', 'where', 'can', 'mix', 'match', 'different', 'segments', ""'ll"", 'get', 'good', 'workout', 'do', '3', 'upper', 'body', 'sections', 'are', 'familiar', 'exercises', 'Kimberly', 'interesting', 'tempo', 'changes', 'different', 'combinations', 'core', 'section', 'short', 'tough', 'v', 'sit-ups', 'leg', 'drops', 'few', 'crunches', 'leg', 'section', 'standing', 'lunges', 'squats', 'plie', 'combos', 'would', ""'ve"", 'preferred', 'section', 'be', 'longer', 'include', 'floorwork', '15', 'minute', 'total', 'body', 'section', ""'ll"", 'work', 'upper', 'lower', 'body', 'same', 'time', 'doing', 'squats', 'lunges', 'few', 'bicep', 'curls', 'mostly', 'shoulder', 'work', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', ""'ll"", 'do', 'chest', 'flies', 'v', 'sit', 'position', 'then', 'plank', 'exercises', 'pace', 'workout', 'good', 'used', '5', 'lb', 'weights', 'individual', 'sections', 'was', 'sore', 'next', 'day', 'total', 'body', 'had', 'go', 'lighter', 'weights', 'shoulder', 'work', 'Kimberly', 'friendly', 'soft', 'spoken', 'instructor', 'Tamilee', 'Webb', 'outdoor', 'scenery', 'mountains', 'back', 'was', 'nice', 'change']",SELF - Trim & Tone Fast!
1091878,A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL,B000TSJ02C,Little Miss Cutey,"[20, 21]","This is a really brilliant workout that I do a couple of times a week and find it very effective and fun.  Kimberly Spreen is a great instructor who is friendly, motivating and knows what she's talking about.  She's not annoying and she pushes you a little when you think you want to stop.It's a little under an hour, and 45 minutes of it is your toning workout.  You WILL feel this in the morning, but you'll know you did yourself some good.  There are six different segments and each of them work a specific body part.  Within each segment, you change tempo or angle etc to really challenge your muscles.  I find that that has been a big help in 'shocking' your muscles and making you push through plateauxs you might have.She cues really well and so you always know what to do next.  I highly recommend this for anyone who does a lot of cardio but wants to trim down more by getting your muscles to elevate your metabolism.

However, if you've been lifting weight for any amount of time, you will find that you will need to modify a lot of elements in this workout.

For example, the back section only exercises the upper back, while completely neglecting the lower back.  The shoulders are excessively worked out, but the outer thighs are never exercised (for another example).Still, you might be able to pair this video with others that exercise the missed muscles.

1091881,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B000TSJ02C,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[1, 1]","If you have ANY lower back issues you should avoid this workout. It is a bit back intense. Mainly the problem is when you are bending over with weights in your hands. It seems to create just a bit of an imbalance. I did however like some of the exercises and they did push me to my limits many times. So yes this is a good challenge. What you will be doing is a warm up then legs, back, shoulders, arms, chest, core and a full body workout. You can pick and choose or do all the workouts in a row. The full body workout is sixteen minutes while the core workout is a little over six minutes. To be honest I liked trying this workout but I won't be buying it. I just wouldn't put my back through this again. At the end of the workouts there is a stretch routine however I continued to stretch long afterwards while the music played on. RENT BEFORE YOU BUY!
