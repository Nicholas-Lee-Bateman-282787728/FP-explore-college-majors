728439,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00007G1YQ,A Customer,"[4, 5]","Summary:Viktor Taransky (Al Pacino) is a movie director who hasn't had much recent success.  The movie begins with the star of his current film, Nicola Anders (Winona Ryder), walking off of the film when it is nearly complete.  This ruins Viktor's career and his ex-wife, Elaine Christian (Catherine Keener), who is also his boss, fires him.  As he is leaving the studio, Viktor is approached by Hal Sinclair (Jay Mohr) who has developed a computer program that is good enough to replace actors in films with virtual actors.  In developing the program, Hal has contracted cancer and is going to die.  He is so frantic about his project that he initially turns off Viktor but when he wills his work to Viktor and Viktor realizes just what it can do, he uses the program to introduce Simone into the film he was working on and cuts out Nicola.  When Viktor releases the film, Simone is a smash hit and everyone wants to meet her.  Of course, that isn't possible because she is a computer program.  So Viktor begins a whirlwind of activity to continue Simone's appearances and movies while trying to keep everyone believing that she is an actual person.My Comments:The movie is pretty funny.  I was surprised it was as funny as it was because I don't think it did very well in the box office and it didn't get very many favorable reviews (at least, from what I've seen).  I actually thought the premise was pretty good and the idea was surprisingly plausible (call me gullible if you will).  I also liked that it was making subtle commentaries on what stardom is really like - sometimes the more outlandish you are the more you are liked (Christina Aguilera and Madonna come to mind).Admittedly, the ending was, well, not so great.  But, I'm not exactly sure there was a good way to end the movie so I didn't fault the movie for the ending.  Though I haven't given it much thought, I couldn't come up with a better way for it to end so I'm dismissing that problem.  There was one thing that I felt played out as something of a deus ex machina and that was Taransky's daughter's (Lainey Christian played by Evan Rachel Wood) interest in computers and how she so easily reversed a virus and recreated a program when the hard drives from the computers had all been dumped.  It just wasn't very plausible and seemed like a plot-point that they tried to emphasize earlier in the movie so as to make it possible to use it in the end; it was unnatural, which is typically the case with deus ex machinas.Anyway, despite its drawbacks, I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it.  As for being a commentary on Hollywood, I guess I'm contrasting it with Mulholland Drive and The Player, both of which were also commentaries and were, well, [bad] in my opinion.",3,An intelligible and funny commentary on Hollywood.,1049068800,"03 31, 2003",2003,2747,"['Summary', 'Viktor', 'Taransky', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'movie', 'director', 'who', ""n't"", 'had', 'much', 'recent', 'success', 'movie', 'star', 'current', 'film', 'Nicola', 'Anders', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'walking', 'film', 'when', 'nearly', 'complete', 'Viktor', 'career', 'ex-wife', 'Elaine', 'Christian', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'who', 'also', 'boss', 'leaving', 'studio', 'Viktor', 'approached', 'Hal', 'Sinclair', 'Jay', 'Mohr', 'who', 'developed', 'computer', 'program', 'good', 'enough', 'replace', 'actors', 'films', 'virtual', 'actors', 'developing', 'program', 'Hal', 'contracted', 'cancer', 'going', 'die', 'so', 'frantic', 'project', 'initially', 'off', 'Viktor', 'when', 'work', 'Viktor', 'Viktor', 'just', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'program', 'introduce', 'Simone', 'film', 'was', 'working', 'cuts', 'out', 'Nicola', 'When', 'Viktor', 'film', 'Simone', 'smash', 'hit', 'everyone', 'meet', 'course', ""n't"", 'possible', 'computer', 'program', 'So', 'Viktor', 'whirlwind', 'activity', 'continue', 'Simone', 'appearances', 'movies', 'trying', 'keep', 'everyone', 'believing', 'actual', 'person.My', 'Comments', 'movie', 'pretty', 'funny', 'was', 'surprised', 'was', 'as', 'funny', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'very', 'many', 'favorable', 'reviews', 'least', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'actually', 'thought', 'premise', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'plausible', 'call', 'gullible', 'will', 'also', 'liked', 'was', 'making', 'subtle', 'commentaries', 'what', 'stardom', 'really', 'like', 'sometimes', 'more', 'outlandish', 'are', 'more', 'are', 'liked', 'Christina', 'Aguilera', 'Madonna', 'come', 'mind', '.Admittedly', 'ending', 'was', 'well', 'not', 'so', 'great', ""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'was', 'good', 'way', 'end', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'fault', 'movie', 'ending', 'have', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'thought', 'could', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'better', 'way', 'end', 'so', ""'m"", 'dismissing', 'problem', 'was', 'one', 'thing', 'felt', 'played', 'out', 'something', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'was', 'Taransky', 'daughter', 'Lainey', 'Christian', 'played', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'interest', 'computers', 'how', 'so', 'easily', 'reversed', 'virus', 'recreated', 'program', 'when', 'hard', 'drives', 'computers', 'had', 'been', 'dumped', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'plausible', 'seemed', 'plot-point', 'tried', 'emphasize', 'earlier', 'movie', 'so', 'make', 'possible', 'use', 'end', 'was', 'unnatural', 'typically', 'case', 'deus', 'ex', 'machinas.Anyway', 'drawbacks', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'being', 'commentary', 'Hollywood', 'guess', ""'m"", 'contrasting', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', 'Player', 'were', 'also', 'commentaries', 'were', 'well', '[', 'bad', ']', 'opinion']",Simone

I was truly disappointed with this film and Al Pacino's role in it.  It wasn't very good.Andrew Niccol had done a great job with The Truman Show and Gatacca.  What happened?  This movie was sub-par in many ways and falls short of what I would call a good film.Al Pacino plays Viktor Taransky, a director, whose recent string of films have tanked.  One of the producers happen to be his ex-wife (Catherine Keener).  She tells him it's time to pack up his stuff and leave.  Just as he's doing so, a ""mad scientist"" if you will (named Hank played by Elias Koteas) approaches him and tells him how he's achieved the impossible and that he's one of Pacino's biggest fans.  His achievement was the creation of Simulation One - Sim One - Simone.  Pacino's character turns Simone into an overnight sensation that everyone thinks is a real person.  From here, Elaine (Viktor's wife) takes him back into her production company.  Viktor then continues to come up with movies for Simone to star in while trying to abate the growing public interest in knowing more about Simone.  At the same time Simone begins to consume Viktor.  Viktor talks to Simone, and answers himself as Simone.  Both are one and the same; split personalities in Viktor's head.  How Viktor chooses to deal with Simone's (yet ironically, not Viktor's) success is the subject of the rest of the movie.The end was a bit predictable and I can think of better (albeit more twisted) endings to this film.  Simone is really an empty-shell of a movie.  It doesn't require much thought to watch.  The public in the movie are just as mindless as the technical aspects of this film.  The acting is of sit-com quality.  Pacino was being his drunk-mopey self again.  (I was beginning to wonder what happened to Jason Schwartzman after Rushmore.  Well, he's in this film.  For Catherine Keener fans, you might want to watch Lovely and Amazing instead.)Working with computers all my life, I found the use of the 5.25"" disk, the computers with absolutely no wiring on their backs, a projection screen with no projector, keyboards conveniently customized with all the functions Viktor needs, and viruses that can be cured by simple keystrokes to be extremely ridiculous and laughable.I would recommend the viewer pass on this one.LEAP rating (each out of 5):============================L (Language) - 2 (nothing really stands out about this film, it tries to be a film about family but fails)E (Erotica) - 0.5 (n/a - just good looking actresses (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Rachel Roberts))A (Action) - 0 (n/a)P (Plot) - 3 (juvenile plot, substandard acting, completely unbelievable)",3,"Yikes, give me something else to watch...",1031529600,"09 9, 2002",2002,2729,"[""'m"", 'suprised', 'see', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'film', 'Well', 'allow', 'balance', 'scales', 'little', 'was', 'truly', 'disappointed', 'film', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'role', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good.Andrew', 'Niccol', 'had', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'Truman', 'Show', 'Gatacca', 'What', 'happened', 'movie', 'was', 'sub-par', 'many', 'ways', 'short', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'good', 'film.Al', 'Pacino', 'Viktor', 'Taransky', 'director', 'recent', 'string', 'films', 'have', 'tanked', 'One', 'producers', 'happen', 'be', 'ex-wife', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'time', 'pack', 'up', 'stuff', 'leave', 'Just', 'doing', 'so', 'mad', 'scientist', 'will', 'named', 'Hank', 'played', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'how', 'achieved', 'impossible', 'one', 'Pacino', 'biggest', 'fans', 'achievement', 'was', 'creation', 'Simulation', 'One', 'Sim', 'One', 'Simone', 'Pacino', 'character', 'Simone', 'overnight', 'sensation', 'everyone', 'real', 'person', 'here', 'Elaine', 'Viktor', 'wife', 'back', 'production', 'company', 'Viktor', 'then', 'come', 'up', 'movies', 'Simone', 'star', 'trying', 'abate', 'growing', 'public', 'interest', 'knowing', 'more', 'Simone', 'same', 'time', 'Simone', 'consume', 'Viktor', 'Viktor', 'talks', 'Simone', 'answers', 'Simone', 'are', 'one', 'same', 'split', 'personalities', 'Viktor', 'head', 'How', 'Viktor', 'deal', 'Simone', 'yet', 'ironically', 'not', 'Viktor', 'success', 'subject', 'rest', 'movie.The', 'end', 'was', 'bit', 'predictable', 'can', 'think', 'better', 'more', 'twisted', 'film', 'Simone', 'really', 'empty-shell', 'movie', ""n't"", 'require', 'much', 'thought', 'watch', 'public', 'movie', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'mindless', 'technical', 'aspects', 'film', 'acting', 'sit-com', 'quality', 'Pacino', 'was', 'being', 'drunk-mopey', 'self', 'again', 'was', 'beginning', 'wonder', 'what', 'happened', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'Rushmore', 'Well', 'film', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'fans', 'might', 'want', 'watch', 'Lovely', 'Amazing', 'instead', 'Working', 'computers', 'life', 'found', 'use', '5.25', 'disk', 'computers', 'absolutely', 'wiring', 'backs', 'projection', 'screen', 'projector', 'keyboards', 'conveniently', 'customized', 'functions', 'Viktor', 'needs', 'viruses', 'can', 'be', 'cured', 'simple', 'keystrokes', 'be', 'extremely', 'ridiculous', 'laughable.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'viewer', 'pass', 'one.LEAP', 'rating', '5', '============================L', 'Language', '2', 'nothing', 'really', 'out', 'film', 'be', 'film', 'family', 'fails', 'E', 'Erotica', '0.5', 'n/a', 'just', 'good', 'looking', 'actresses', 'Rebecca', 'Romijn-Stamos', 'Rachel', 'Roberts', 'A', 'Action', '0', 'n/a', 'P', 'Plot', '3', 'juvenile', 'plot', 'substandard', 'acting', 'completely', 'unbelievable']",Simone

I didn't see it in the movies nor did I want to. That being said, I went into this with absolutely no pre-conceived notions or desires. I didn't care about the story one bit, but at the end I found it to be somewhat entertaining and humorous. I thought Pacino did a good job with his comedic role. ...I also got a kick out of the fact that this movie mocked its Hollywood brethren! How Hollywood is so pretentious and fake! It also poked fun at us, John Q public, for our need of idols and heroes. How we take someone who's an actor (of all things) and put them on a pedestal. Pacino is Viktor Taransky a film director (of artsy type movies) who's new movie is about to be scrapped because the female lead, Nicola Anders, played by Winona Ryder, walks. It seems she can't be satisfied, no lights are bright enough or trailers big enough for her, and she is the quintessential egotistic movie actor. Taransky is fed up with these spoiled children disguised as actors and just when he's about to give up, a dying computer programmer wills him a program called simulation one (or Simone for short). With this creation, Taransky feels he has found the perfect actor, one who only cares about the picture and not themselves. Everything seems to be perfect except for one tiny wrinkle; the whole worlds' appetite to be close with our idols.

Pacino plays film director Victor Taransky who has a falling out with an egotistical and talentless actress Nicola Anders (Winona Ryder), which results in Taransky being dumped by his production company. To add insult to injury Victor's ex-wife works there and must break the news to him.But luckily for Victor, a guardian angel appears in the guise of Hank Aleno, a computer geek who lost his right eye to a tumor (The result of too much time sitting close to a computer). Aleno enlists Victor to help breathe life into his project. Unfortunately Hank dies but leaves Victor a gift in his will: S1M0NE (an acronym for Simulation One, played by the very real newcomer Rachel Roberts): History's first artificial, manufactured movie star with all the prerequisites a director dreams of: Talent, beauty and no ego. Described as having ""The voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of Grace Kelly and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel"". When S1M0NE's debut film SUNRISE, SUNSET is released it becomes an instant hit and rises Taransky's career from the doldrums overnight. The only problem is that nobody knows this brilliant new screen sensation is a fake. So Victor must work twice as hard hiding the truth from Hollywood, the paparazzi and the public. As Pacino says in the movie: ""It's easier to make 100,000 believe than just 1"".Soon S1M0NE is catapulted almost overnight to the status of the World's #1 Movie Star, endorsing her own cologne, recording CDs and even having a yacht christened after her- but journos soon start latching on to the charade. To make matters worse Taransky's ex-wife thinks he's having an affair and the world thinks he's controlling S1M0NE against her will. Taransky decides the only way to escape is to destroy S1M0NE's reputation: but these efforts only serve to add to her celebrity. How will Victor get away with this?S1M0NE is far superior to THE TRUMAN SHOW, and although it takes a while to get going, once it does S1M0NE is a very good movie. Film buffs will especially enjoy it, with its clever concept and all round good performances.

Middleton,"[2, 2]","Those of us not privy to the inside world of the film industry, apart from the numerous gossip newspapers, magazines and television shows that currently fill the market place, most of us mere mortals wouldn't have a clue as to what really goes on behind the scenes. A majority of us, however, have come across a few prima donnas in our time, and can understand the difficulties in working with these kinds of people. Film and theatre directors must run across them on a regular basis. This wonderful satire on the film industry focuses on a unique solution for sidestepping a difficult actor by creating a virtual one, a perfect performer that a director can mould to his/her exact specifications without a single protest. Meet Simone: the most beautiful, talented and agreeable actor in the world - the virtual star, a director's ultimate fantasy.Writer/director, Andrew Niccol, seems to have an on-going fascination with this theme: virtual people, environments and the perfect world. Niccol's original masterful screenplay, `The Truman Show', is another satire on the media and particularly, `reality television' that currently saturates prime time. In his stylish SF film, `Gattica', eugenics is explored, and the speculative notions of what constitute the perfect human being. In ~Simone~, he not only explores the benefits of having a virtual actor working for a frustrated director, but focuses on the celebrity phenomenon, and the curious `hero-worship' tendencies of the general public. The film is essentially a study of the media-generated `image' verses the `real'; or at least what we perceive to be the real.As usual, Al Pacino put in a great performance as the creatively frustrated director - Victor Taransky. The computer-generated star, Simone, played by Rachel Roberts, was a stunning performance in its subtle nuances and her near perfect, albeit stereotypical, beauty. More impressive still, is the special effects made in creating the virtual star and the clever editing which made the scenes between Pacino and Roberts so believable.This is a humorous satire on the entertainment industry and an interesting study on the phenomenon of `celebrity', as well as a look into the possible technical future of filmmaking.

Al Pacino plays Victor Turansky, a two time oscar nominated director who has just been fired from his production company by his ex wife because he chased off high profile actress Nicola Andress (played by Winona Ryder).  As he is leaving the lot, a computer geek approaches him and tells him he has the answer to all his problems.  The answer lies in a computer hard drive that holds the secret to Simulation One.  Sim One is a computer code that will create the perfect humanoid actress.  When Hank (the computer geek mentioned above) dies, he leaves the hard drive to Turansky.  When Turansky puts in the hard drive and see what Sim One looks like, he becomes convinced.  He sets on a path to finish the movie that he nearly lost everything for.  What he ends up with is a film that stars an actress that that doesnt realy exist, but will not go away.  Sim One becomes Simone and she takes on a life of her own.

Rachel Roberts as Simone. She is absolutely gorgeous and from that standpoint helps make the concept that the public are going crazy over her somewhat believable. Some of the computer graphic effects were great, I especially liked one part when Pacino added a hint of Audrey Hepburn and Lauren Bacall to give just the right mannerism and voice to his virtual actress. The whole concept and plot of the movie, except for the details were mind provoking.Some of the flaws... unbelievable and technically inaccurate elements that jarr you out of the fantasy and into a state of ""yeah right"". For example, this incredible virtual actress is delivered to Pacino in a hard drive which he loads onto his PC in the CD tray! Anybody with a PC would know this is not technically possible. Furthermore, the computing power to handle creating this virtual actress would require a whole bank of PCs or a supercomputer, yet he was able to run it off his regular desktop. Anyone with a little bit of technical knowhow will see that is artistic licence to the extreme, or more likely abysmal technical ignorance of the Director.If technical inaccuracies don't bother you, then how about the fact that his daughter (and numerous others close to Taranski), don't question more strongly why they are never able to ever get to meet Simone.  Weak excuses are made, but you can't help but question if in real life people would really let things slide like that.Taranski (Al Pacino) looks like an old tired, slightly crazed man throughlout the movie. His character doesn't seem to develop. You would expect him to undergo a transformation when his movie with Simone becomes a hit.  But that doesn't happen.I think many of the flaws are because the movie was written, directed and produced by one person.

For it to work, people have to act and think in such an idiotic manner for the better part of two hours, and as an audience, we just can't take it.  A good definition for this is called the ""Idiot Plot"" by the esteemed reviewer Roger Ebert and it certainly applies here.Simone does not have a bad premise.  Al Pacino is a struggling filmmaker who at the beginning of the film has his main actress walk out on him for a bunch of childish reasons (her trailor is not the highest on the lot), leaving him with no actress.  His fellow filmmakers including ex wife Catherine Keener think the project needs to be trashed, since the actress will sue if she appears in the movie in any way.At this point, Pacino is approached by a nutty guy who eventually gives him a hard drive with a computerized actress (Simulation One= Simone).  The man dies before Pacino gets the gift and although he is reluctant at first, he learns how to work it.  The film is redone with ""Simone"" and is a smash.  Pacino is a star.The problem is that the world thinks that Simone is a real person and Pacino tries to keep this information secret.  But since Simone becomes easily the most popular and famous person on the planet almost instantly, what person watching this film will actually believe that the characters in the movie will not figure out that Simone is fake when:1)No one actually speaks to or sees her live.2)There are no pictures of her at all.3)It must be at least 6 months or longer that Pacino keeps up the hoax, because Simone appears in 3 movies.Come on!  The movie could have been good if it had been more about the premise of using a totally computerized character as a lead, not trying to keep it clandestine from the rest of society.  With the technology available today, it is simply ridiculous to think that no one would ever figure it out.Overall the movie was not terrible, but I won't want to see it again.

Call her the Bo Derek of this millennium except, Rochel Roberts (Canadian born model as Simone) who is breath taking will quickly make you forget Bo. Simone, a computer-generated blend of Hollywood's greatest starlets predictably becomes an overnight Hollywood sensation. Victor Taransky (Al Pacino) takes advantage of this animation and secretly creates a character that soon wins two Oscars and becomes an international superstar. Victor trying to keep his creation secrete, continues to get pressure for Simone to make public appearances. Victor finally figures out a way to trick the public, the media, and the heads of the studio by using a hologram and special effects (Not as far-fetched as one might think in today's computer world). The movie is very entertaining and fun for the entire family. Pacino's one-liners are especially funny when he realizes he is going to have to kill-off Simone. ""She indestructible"", he mutters from his prison cell (the police think he killed her) as he sees her on a breaking television news story. The movie is time well spent as well as, a great addition to your DVD collection. It will bring a smile to anyone.

Yet it is here in Simone that he is at his most hilarious and shrewd when this wicked satire lampoons the obsession of human with technology and how the creator becomes enslaved to it as in the Pygmalion and Frankenstein fables.Ravaged director Victor Taransky (Al Pacino) is given a chance to resuscitate his lackluster career. His production is wrecked by the exit of his actress (Winona Ryder) and his ex-wife (Catherine Keener) who helms Amalgamated Pictures terminates his contact. A deranged scientist whiz hands him a computer programme where Simulation One, a luscious cybermodel (Rachel Roberts) is extracted to star in his new movie. Taransky is embraced by the public and press for discovering this sparkling ingenue.From then the humour rolls in. The suspense too - when Tarnasky has to play along to convince that Simone is real, but the success becomes too overwhelming that when Taransky tries to remove her, he is charged for murder. SIMONE manages to acquit itself with sly humour and top-notch acting from maverick Al Pacino and the excellent Catherine Keener in her tart and sass. It explores the dark side of human with light humour and is disturbing as a social commentary on the adverse effects on computer proliferation. To think of it - last year's Final Fantasy surfaces grippingly as a totally digitized movie to justify this claim.

Unfortunately, it runs out of gas just as it should be peaking.  What elevates it is its merciless satire of American pop culture driven by mass-media communications and computer technology which has approached the levels of the miraculous.Al Pacino plays Victor Taransky, a Hollywood director in a tailspin until a series of accidents lead him to create the world's first""virtual"" movie star, Simone.  Although no one has ever seen ""the real Simone (the movie's original title, by the way), she is so flawless, so beautiful, so ideal in every way, that everybody wants her.  The movie uses this contradiction and frustration of expectations to mercilessly skewer the masses' will to believe an appealing fantasy, regardless of its being ""too good to be true,"" in scene after scene for nearly two-thirds of the picture.  There is a rising level of satirical hilarity during that time that no Hollywood movie since ""Dr. Strangelove"" has approached.Al Pacino devours this role like a starving man let loose in an Italian deli.  He always hits just the right note with just the right inflection, and his timing is impeccable.  It's too bad that the character of Victor Taransky owes more to Pacino's wonderful performance than what's in the script.What defeats this film from achieving true greatness is the fact that it is, after all, a one-joke comedy.  Even as brilliant as it is (and it is brilliant), that joke eventually runs out of momentum.  Finally, after sustaining its tough-as-nails cynicism for most of its running time, it finds its heart, which deflates it pretty quickly.  Things are not helped by the fact that most of the dramatis personae are really caricatures, rather than characters, who rely on brilliant performances by a fine ensemble cast, rather than a brilliant script to flesh them out.  So, when Victor and his scam are finally exposed, it is neither tragic nor funny, but merely sad.Nevertheles, for two-thirds of its running time, this movie will have laughing hysterically, not at the characters, but at ourselves.

While this may not register in the 'best films of the decade' category, it certainly challenges both our thinking and our imagination and creates a sense of wonder at just how far we have come with computer generation.Has-been movie director/producer Viktor Taransky (Al Pacino, shining) faces disaster when his star Nicola Anders (Winona Ryder) deserts his latest desperate need for a hit film and comes up with the alternative - create a superstar by using a digital synthespian, a creature who via computer codes is destined to do anything the creator decides.  And voila!  Simone (or rather S1m0ne - Sim-One, the technology used to creature such ventures.) Viktor is saved as Simone (Rachel Roberts) becomes the superstar of Viktor's dreams - winning awards, and Viktor's heart - only requiring that he ultimately tell the public of his sham, a deed he attempts to avoid through means that place him in big trouble.  The story is fantasy, but in Niccol's hands the fantasy becomes possibility and makes us question just how far advanced have we become...perhaps too far.The strong supporting cast includes, along with Winona Ryder, Catherine Keener, Benjamin Salisbury, Jay Mohr, Evan Rachel Woods, and of course the digitally altered Rachel Roberts. The test of a good comedy is whether it can incorporate tragedy and still entertain. This film succeeds.

Thompson,"[5, 6]","Simone is about a very artistic film director (Pacino) who feels underappreciated toward himself and toward movies, that they should be creative works of art that are created by the visionary director rather than the stars that act in them.At a low point in his career, Viktor (Pacino) inherits a computer program from a scientist he met at a film conference awhile back. It turns out that this program is the key to everything he's ever wanted in film-making; a completely real looking actress that he can design and control every word and every feeling of in order to shape his movies exactly the way he envisions without the pain of dealing with whiny actors and actresses.His first movie with her as the lead not only saves his career, but is such a smash hit that the public becomes ravenous for more. Viktor hides her from the public constantly, which only fuels their desire to see her and love for her.Eventually, things get so out of hand that Viktor decides to get everyone to back off by making Simone unlikable. He stars her in a humiliating film and has her go on a talk show denouncing things people tend to like and endorsing things like ""eating dolphin"" that most people tend to frown upon. None of these things work, and only serves to give Simone a more multi-dimentional personality that facinates the public.So then he decides the only way to get rid of her is to ""kill"" her. This backfires, and he is accused of murdering Simone and covering up the evidence.In my review, I won't say anything particular about the ending, but all in all, Simone is a very enjoyable movie.I think it should be noted that probably the real reason this movie wasn't a larger hit with moviegoers lies in a couple very interesting points:1. It is incorrectly classified as a Comedy first, and a Drama second. It should be the other way around because people going to the movies expecting a flat out comedy would be duly disappointed. It is more of a drama that has funny parts.2. The movies tries to do ""too much"" in the way of themes and messages to the audience. At first its about the morality of digital creation and deception, then it becomes about Viktor's obsession with wanting to be recognized, then it's about the creation developing a life of its own. The movie did very well incorporating all of these things together, but did not conclude any of them with any great degree of satisfaction. I think it would've been more successful focusing on just one of the themes and developing it to the fullest.But aside from all of that, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and think that it never got the attention it deserved.

Now, this wasn't quite true in 2002, as they had to resort to using a real actress and computer tricks to create Simone. But 10 years have passed, CGI is the in thing, and the results are, well, scary. And I think that makes this film more compelling now than it was when I first saw it. Back then it was just interesting. We still don't have virtual actors. When they use them in movies like Beowolf, we can tell they are not real. And computer animation is one thing. But most of the effects they put in live-action movies are so seamless (except when they overdo it or use effects that are not perfected yet) everything appears to be real. And I hate that. Even on silly websites like facebook, there are easy little programs that let ordinary people add fake things to their photos and make it look real. These days, we never know anymore if we can believe what we see, and people are so obsessed with CGI and technology that no one seems to have a problem with it!Yes, Simone was ahead of its time. It was enjoyable to watch. It was funny and ironic. But then, it was not funny when you seriously considered the message, that people are so easily fooled. It also made fun of Hollywood, stars who are full of themselves, the public's obsessions with famous people, etc. Very witty.

728471,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00007G1YQ,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[8, 10]","A strange story indeed. A mediocre to average film maker is willed a strange  machine  by some mad scientist before dying. This computerized device enables the film maker to produce the best actress ever, ideal as for her looks and her acting, but also ideal as for her cost which is practically nil, because she is a completely virtual person. The film then analyzes the rich consequences of her existence. How can an actress exist if she does not satisfy the wants and desires of her fellow actors, her producer, her public and the media ? She is by definition invisible, unreachable and unmeetable. And yet she exists because she is in the films and she is in the press and media. The director has to invent situations to make people believe she exists, or rather to satisfy their belief that she does exist. This leads to a cannibalistic relation because she psychologically devours the director completely. But it is not that easy to destroy her because no one wants to believe she does not exist, and his attempt will be considered as murder, since that actress does exist in the public eye. Then you have to plead guilty of a murder that never was or insanity for a murder that did not happen ever. How can the director get out of this imbroglio ? That is the end of the film. It is in other words a denunciation of the absolute gullibility of the public and the media, and of the absolute impossibility for any actor to have a real private life, to be an actor and nothing else, particularly not a show-case or show-window exhibit or circus animal. This is maybe extreme but it is fundamentally true. It reveals how an actor is taken over by his parts under the heavy presssure of the public and the media, and also his or her psyche, to be what he or she is in his or her films, to be the actor seven days a week and 24 hours a day. It is a completely de-humanizing profession and position. The public is cruel but just following their impulses, and desires, whereas the media are willfully cruel in order to make money by selling their  goods  to the wider public, hence nourishing and nurturing the cannibalistic voyeurism of this public. A great film with a fantastic Al Pacino in the role of the director.

All his projects usually seem to hae an artistic angle even the blood drenched SCARFACE.  Pacino has been in some great movies from the GODFATHER to HEAT to INSOMNIA but as only ventured into comedy territory twice.  First with AUTHOR! AUTHOR! and then in DICK TRACEY.  The one person you can paralel with Pacino is Mr. De Niro.  Robert De Niro also started on a Godfather film but seemed to go through what Pacino went through faster.  De Niro did his (TAXI DRIVER) phycological thriller ten years before Pacino (SCARFACE) did.  And if you dont think SCARFACE is phycological think about how much it is like an opera.  Anyway my point is Robert De Niro went from serious mob movies to comedies which is why he is more well known, Hes done more family acceptable films.  Finally Pacino is going the De Niro way ad doing a comedy.  SIMONE has some fresh things to it (especially that it is Pacino's third movie the was not rated R out of about 30)  The other two were the comedies I mentioned earlier.SIMONE follows the stuggles of a producer Viktor something or other (Pacino) who is down on his luck.  Using the technology of today he creates a computer generated woman and puts her image in a movie.  Her name is, yep you guessed it Simone.  Simone becomes famous and very well loved leaving Pacino in the dark.  So he tries to destroy her but ends up destroying his image even more.  Its like a modern day Frankenstien.Of course Pacino gives a great performance and what is suprising is how funny Al really is.  This is a good movie and funny comedy.

She's a complex computer-simulated image that Victor can mess around with, by putting her in interviews, films, and live music concerts.

His movie-stars abandon him, he is about to be dumped by the studio he works for (and the studio is owned by his ex-wife, the cute and funny-faced Catherine Keener), and he has mortgaged everything he owns to pay for a movie that is not going to be filmed. Then, a strange computer genious (played by the strangest actor ever, Elias Koteas) gives him the solution to all his problems: a digital, beautiful actress, Simone - Simulation One. From that point, Simone is a huge success, but Taransky has to constantly find ways to hide from general audience that Simone in fact doesn't exist.Here's a tip if you want to enjoy this movie: DON'T TAKE ANYTHING IN THIS MOVIE SERIOUSLY. Obviously, there are many technological flaws, plot holes, absurdities, etc. But &quot;Simone&quot; is not, as one recent reviewer stated, a technological-breakthrough movie. Of course not. It's a fairy-tale, something the Brothers Grimm or Hans Christian Andersen could create if they lived in the 21st century. So, if you set your mind to watch &quot;Simone&quot; as a serious movie, you're going to hate it. Otherwise, if you think of it as a funny entertainment or as a Pinocchio disguised with technology, you will find it, to say the least, cute.One other thing: both Pacino and Keener are not well cast in this film.

Thus it spends the majority of its time poking fun at itself, and not enough time developing humor.S1m0ne starts off with an interesting concept, but fails to deliver on any of its potential.  Considering that Pacino has helped create her, this would lead most movies into a Frankenstinian area where S1m0ne becomes sentient.

At that point, every other plot point becomes predictable, and the happy ending is painfully obvious.Considering that the movie promotes itself by proclaiming to feature an entirely computer generated star, our expectations are high.  When we learn that S1m0ne was actually portrayed by an unknown actress, we get our first of many disappointments.I found it more interesting to contemplate how many levels this film didn't work, rather than think about the rather silly plot it supplied us with.If you wan't a CGI character, try Two Towers.

Bernabo,"[2, 4]","It would be easy to dismiss &quot;S1m0ne&quot; as an attempt by writer Andrew Niccol to have another success similar to &quot;The Truman Show&quot; dealing with the way the mass media distorts reality for entertainment purposes.  This time, instead of dealing with a human being living an artificial life for the ultimate reality show, we have an artificial life created for the silver screen. Director Viktor Taransky (Al Pacino) finds his career is in a death spiral when he inherits a computer program from a mad scientist (Elias Koteas), which allows him to create a computer-generated star named Simone.  The Catch-22 is that the more famous she becomes the more he is forced to maintain the illusion that she is real.Certainly Niccol has a compelling idea here.  As we move beyond Jar-Jar Binks to computer generated characters like Gollum and other wonders down the road I have no doubt that the day will come when neither death nor age will stop our favorite movie stars from making movies.  So what if your favorite actor and actress never made a film together: it can happen in the future.  Think of some of the remakes that could be made: Katharine Hepburn originally wanted Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy to co-star with her in &quot;The Philadelphia Story.&quot;  One day somebody (or a legion of somebodies) could make it happen.  However, Niccol is not really sure what his point is with this movie.  Obviously there is some sort of satire going on here, but the target gets obscured.Part of it is the gullibility of the audience, that embraces Simone no mater what she says or does as programmed by Viktor.  He can make her, but apparently he cannot break her.  Then there is the ability of the Hollywood starmaking machine to fill in the gaps and provide a history for a fictional creation of its own volition.  But for me the problem is illuminated when Viktor hits bottom and is informed by his ex-wife (Catherine Keener), &quot;You did not make Simone, she made you.&quot;  At this point I am thinking that since Viktor not only created Simone but wrote and directed her films he obviously has some talent.  I have seen plenty of great actors do good jobs in lousy movies, but there are few times you can find a great acting performance in a movie with a bad script.  Ironically, the writer of this script seems to have forgotten that fact.This movie is also saddled with a romantic sub-plot as Viktor's ex-wife is jealous of the closeness between her ex-husband and his secretive mega-star that really takes the bite out of any stinging satire.  Besides, with Evan Rachel Wood playing the pair's daughter you know that she is smarter than the two of them put together and are not surprised when she plays a pivotal role in the film's climax.  Rachel Roberts plays Simone (and models for her computer generated counterpart) and does an adequate job, since nobody could be as dazzling as the &quot;real&quot; Simone would be.The best part of this film is early on when Viktor is designing Simone (picking bits and pieces of great actresses from various computer files) and as we find out she is the &quot;perfect&quot; actress.  After all, Simone does not need a trailer, studio car and driver, anyone to do her hair and makeup, a stand-in or stuntwoman, never complains (even about doing nudity) and never changes the dialogue that appears in a script.  But then the satire gives way to romance and assorted plot complications designed to drive Viktor crazy, at which point it ends up being rather uninspired.  Maybe if the writer had not doubled as the director on this one there would have been somebody who could have made Niccol turn this script into something better.Maybe some day down the road someone will come back and fix this film on their computer with Al Pacino and the rest of the cast as true synthespians.  Wouldn't that be ironic?",3,Good idea but the script loses track of the satire,1063670400,"09 16, 2003",2003,3866,"['would', 'be', 'easy', 'dismiss', 'quot', 'S1m0ne', 'quot', 'attempt', 'writer', 'Andrew', 'Niccol', 'have', 'success', 'similar', 'quot', 'Truman', 'Show', 'quot', 'dealing', 'way', 'mass', 'media', 'reality', 'entertainment', 'purposes', 'time', 'instead', 'dealing', 'human', 'being', 'living', 'artificial', 'life', 'ultimate', 'reality', 'show', 'have', 'artificial', 'life', 'created', 'silver', 'screen', 'Director', 'Viktor', 'Taransky', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'career', 'death', 'spiral', 'when', 'computer', 'program', 'mad', 'scientist', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'create', 'computer-generated', 'star', 'named', 'Simone', 'Catch-22', 'more', 'famous', 'more', 'forced', 'maintain', 'illusion', 'real.Certainly', 'Niccol', 'compelling', 'idea', 'here', 'move', 'Jar-Jar', 'Binks', 'computer', 'generated', 'characters', 'Gollum', 'other', 'wonders', 'down', 'road', 'have', 'doubt', 'day', 'will', 'come', 'when', 'death', 'age', 'will', 'stop', 'favorite', 'movie', 'stars', 'making', 'movies', 'So', 'what', 'favorite', 'actor', 'actress', 'never', 'made', 'film', 'together', 'can', 'happen', 'future', 'Think', 'remakes', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'originally', 'wanted', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'co-star', 'quot', 'Philadelphia', 'Story.', 'quot', 'One', 'day', 'somebody', 'legion', 'somebodies', 'could', 'make', 'happen', 'However', 'Niccol', 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'what', 'point', 'movie', 'Obviously', 'sort', 'satire', 'going', 'here', 'target', 'obscured.Part', 'gullibility', 'audience', 'Simone', 'mater', 'what', 'programmed', 'Viktor', 'can', 'make', 'apparently', 'can', 'not', 'break', 'Then', 'ability', 'Hollywood', 'starmaking', 'machine', 'fill', 'gaps', 'provide', 'history', 'fictional', 'creation', 'own', 'volition', 'problem', 'illuminated', 'when', 'Viktor', 'bottom', 'informed', 'ex-wife', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'quot', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'Simone', 'made', 'you.', 'quot', 'point', 'am', 'thinking', 'Viktor', 'not', 'only', 'created', 'Simone', 'wrote', 'directed', 'films', 'obviously', 'talent', 'have', 'seen', 'plenty', 'great', 'actors', 'do', 'good', 'jobs', 'lousy', 'movies', 'are', 'few', 'times', 'can', 'find', 'great', 'acting', 'performance', 'movie', 'bad', 'script', 'Ironically', 'writer', 'script', 'have', 'forgotten', 'fact.This', 'movie', 'also', 'saddled', 'romantic', 'sub-plot', 'Viktor', 'ex-wife', 'jealous', 'closeness', 'ex-husband', 'secretive', 'mega-star', 'really', 'bite', 'stinging', 'satire', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'playing', 'pair', 'daughter', 'know', 'smarter', 'two', 'put', 'together', 'are', 'not', 'surprised', 'when', 'pivotal', 'role', 'film', 'climax', 'Rachel', 'Roberts', 'Simone', 'models', 'computer', 'generated', 'counterpart', 'adequate', 'job', 'nobody', 'could', 'be', 'as', 'dazzling', 'quot', 'real', 'quot', 'Simone', 'would', 'be.The', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'early', 'when', 'Viktor', 'designing', 'Simone', 'picking', 'bits', 'pieces', 'great', 'actresses', 'various', 'computer', 'files', 'find', 'out', 'quot', 'perfect', 'quot', 'actress', 'Simone', 'not', 'need', 'trailer', 'studio', 'car', 'driver', 'anyone', 'do', 'hair', 'makeup', 'stand-in', 'stuntwoman', 'never', 'even', 'doing', 'nudity', 'never', 'dialogue', 'script', 'then', 'satire', 'way', 'romance', 'assorted', 'plot', 'complications', 'designed', 'drive', 'Viktor', 'crazy', 'point', 'up', 'being', 'rather', 'uninspired', 'Maybe', 'writer', 'had', 'not', 'doubled', 'director', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'somebody', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'Niccol', 'turn', 'script', 'something', 'better.Maybe', 'day', 'down', 'road', 'someone', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'fix', 'film', 'computer', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'rest', 'cast', 'true', 'synthespians', 'Would', ""n't"", 'be', 'ironic']",Simone

728487,A3013MHSQS4Y8Y,B00007G1YQ,lobohombreriera,"[1, 1]","A perfect adition to ""The Truman Show"", ""Simone"" is a movie that just had to be done one of these days. The premise is exactly the opposite of Andrew Niccol's screenplay for Truman: a failed director (Al Pacino) creates a computer-generated actress and makes everyone believe she's real. Very soon, Simone (short for ""Simulation One"") is the new America's sweetheart, winning the love of the whole world and an Academy Award for Best Actress. The fraud goes along nicely until Pacino's character starts to become jealous of his own creation.If you've seen Andrew Niccol's previous film ""Gattaca"", then you know that he's very good for ""what if..."" scenarios. You also probably know that in his case, the movie is not that much about story as it is about concept, about the idea that supports the movie and the message is trying to present. Being that, ""Simone"" is not a perfect movie. Rachel Roberts does a wonderful job at impersonating the digital angel that is Simone, a creature too magnificent to be true, and the whole movie is directed to that same dilemma about what is perfect but ""fake"" and what is flawed but ""real"". What doesn't work so good is that a lot of the plot devices are far too unrealistic and almost unbelievable, especially when it comes to the skills of Al Pacino's character to run, by himself, a bussiness that involves thousands of people. What I mean is that sometimes Niccol goes too far in his own scam. But once you accept this, ""Simone"" becomes a delight. Roberts is extremely beautiful, and you can almost fall in love with her and really believe she's not real, one of the cases when you just get sucked into the movie's own premise.The DVD edition is very good, for a change. No commetary, but two short featurettes that explain the making of the title character and the controversy around virtual actors, or ""synthespians"". Be sure to watch the deleted scenes, since (for a change) they actually enrich the story. A specific scene involving a devoted Simone fan who tells Victor about how the actress changed her life should've been included.To wrap it up, ""Simone"" is a movie that you have to see for yourself. It may be not as sharp as ""Gattaca"" or ""The Truman Show"", but its clever premise and the excellent job that Niccol did in taking his concept to the screen make it a great catch.

728489,A5GIYITYJPWN1,B00007G1YQ,"L P ""lilip""","[1, 2]","I dont understand all the good reviews written about this movie. It was predictable, boring and poorly executed. It just dragged on and on without any high points or wit anywhere.Viktor (Al Pacino) plays a washed up director whose latest picture is doomed when his star walks out on him. His ex-wife, who also happens to be the head of the studio producing his film, refuses to renew his contract and won't have anything to do with him either. In fact, no one wants anything to do with Viktor and his failures as a movie maker. Even unknown nobodies don't want to work with him.Then one day an avid fan and brilliant computer programmer gives Viktor a program he created. It is called ""Simone"" and is a computer program of a tall, blonde, ""gorgeous"" (we'll get ot the gorgeous part later) interactive ""actress"". Viktor programs her to play the lead in his movie - since he couldnt get anyone else to do it - and it turns out to be a hit. Everyone is in in awe of this new ""talent"" and her star keeps rising, even though no one has ever seen her in person and even though she has never shown up to a single movie premiere or promo event. These things are usually in an actor's contract I thought, but neither Viktor is asked about it, nor the studio footing the bill; yeah right, as if a big studio like this would have kept silent when its number one money making star refused to show up to promote the movie.Anyway, of course now that Viktor's movie is a success, suddenly everyone wants something to do with him again - including his ex wife who cries to Viktor that she wants to come back. Uh hu. I am glad they didnt grab into the clichee tooldbox for this one.Somewhere here the movie lost me in absurdity. First there was the whole someone-becoming-famous-without-anyone-having-met- them part. Calling that far fetched would be an understatement. Then there is that part about him being loved by everyone now that he was a fiscal success again; that was not only predictable but from an artistic point of view trite and unimaginative.The huge problem with this movie, however, is the fact that Simone is so popular despite being a computer program no one has ever seen. She even gets nominated for an academy award - all without anyone becoming seriously suspicious. Movies or not, I couldn't buy that. Since this wasn't a fantasy or sci-fi flick, I do expect some resemblance to reality and probable situations.I understand this movie is supposed to be a farce or satire maybe, making fun of the whole Hollywood superficiality and fame thing, but the way it was done was poor. Something is really funny and a satire if the premise upon which it is based is probable and realistic. Sort of like a Woody Allen movie. But the scenario presented to us here is neither probable nor particularly realistic and hence the comedy, the farce, the satire and with it the message, is lost. I know Hollywood is fake and sells a fantasy, but the whole movie industry mistaking a computer simulation for a real person? And then everyone buying it that as an actor, she is camera shy and that she is an agoraphobic? This takes suspending disbelief to new heights as you have to seriously pretend to be living in a parallel universe for this to be remotely plausible. Somehow it seems like no one alerted the actors, especially Pacino and Keener, that this is supposed to be a farce because everyone plays their part seriously. There is just a disconnect here.I admit there were funny moments somewhat towards the end when Simone commits many PR crimes and still is loved and how pathetic all the reporters and talk show hosts and generally all the people in the industry and the fans are who keep worshipping someone based on a role they played in a movie - even though as a human being they do not have many redeeming qualities. That was funny and very true about Hollywood. But overall I must say the movie did more of a bad job than a good one.If they wanted to poke fun at the mindless and fanatical celebrity followers and their zealotry and hypocrisy, they should have gone about it a different way. This movie sort of reminded me a bit ofMonty Python's Life Of Brian - The Immaculate Edition|Life of Brianwhere this kid is mistaken for the messiah and everyone interprets all of his actions, even trivial ones, as divine providence with deep meaning. Now that is a great satire and it is funny because everyone understands that it is a satire. ""Simone"" feels like it is lacking that direction, that spunk, as you keep wondering if this is supposed to be a comedy, a satire or serious.And finally, Simone, played by Rachel Roberts, was neither beautiful nor the stuff of legends. She was lacking something and I think if they were going to make her into the second coming of The Garbo, they should have also picked an appropriate actress, not this washed up tub of plain yogurt. I doubt most people in the audience could identify with the awe Simone was supposedly inspiring. That just added to the lack of plausibility, originality and believability which has been plaguing this movie from the start on.",2,"If you want to see real satire, check out Life of Brian.

Niccol's biggest claim to fame is ""The Truman Show"", and some of that same ""can you believe this is happening?"" comedy weighs on the audience during ""Simone"".  Once again, Niccol gives us a ""movie within a movie"".We're not accustomed to seeing that much of Al Pacino.  Given his brilliant performance as Detective Dormer in ""Insomnia"", earlier this summer, it seems unlikely that Pacino is going to make very many waves in the somewhat lighthearted role (think Henry Higgins) of Viktor Taransky, in this satire.  To think so, however, is to underestimate the brilliant Pacino, whose talent for over- the-top comic drama came shining through in ""Scent of a Woman"" and the farcical role of a modern day Lucifer in ""The Devil's Advocate"".Here, Pacino is the producer of a film, and the creator of a digital film actress (Simone), who takes the place of the leading lady who has left his film.  Panicky, Viktor does not disclose Simone's origins, and plants her in the minds of moviegoers as a new star.  Alas, she is far more successful than her creator ever dreamed of. Viktor alternates from suave and self-possessed to disoriented, and unable to distinguish what is real from the fiction he created.  Viktor becomes almost schizophrenic in dealing with his creation.  As Viktor, Pacino converses with Simone, and then answers himself as the voice of Simone; can he distinguish the difference?  Or, is she his screen successful alter ego?  Ultimately, his jealousy of his creature plays out in the film as a question of free will; will Pacino expose himself by exposing who Simone really is?The movie underscores what a tremendous series of tools technology has created for filmmakers.It's difficult, even knowing that Simone is not real, to not believe in her.  The movie allows us to see how the technology creates an image that is the ultimate actress, one whom will capture the imagination of the American public.Catherine Keener, Elias Koteas and Jay Mohr are somewhat wasted in minor roles in the film.  But the timing, the technology, and the intelligence of Niccol's film make it a movie to see and remember.  And, for its sheer differences from this summer's crop of blockbusters, ""Simone"" is somewhat of a breath of fresh air.  For Pacino fans, it's a must see.

728492,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B00007G1YQ,Martin Asiner,"[2, 4]","There is a fine line that Hollywood must draw between the seeming reality of what audiences see on the screen and what special effects directors make them think that they see.  In SIMONE, director Andrew Niccol further blurs this distinction when Viktor Taransky (Al Pacino), desperate to finish his film when his leading lady (Winona Ryder) walks out, decides to use the gift of a dying computer expert that allows Taransky to create a digitized woman literally from ones and zeros in computer code.  This woman is originally labelled Sim(ulated) One, or Simone.  She can cry, die, and even grunt like a pig on command.  As I was watching, I half expected Pacino to play Taransky as one who fails to see that his own creation is not alive after all, as Anthony Hopkins failed with his puppet Fats in MAGIC.  Instead Taransky sees Simone as the means to restore the faded luster of his directorial reputation.  He speaks to her, exhorts her to emote, but in a way that the audience is clear that Simone is the means to an end, rather than the end itself.Simone saves his reputation, and in fact becomes the star of several other films.  Toward the end, the plot bogs down in predictable ways, with Simone's adoring audience creating a target for their adulation, the result of which is to stir up feelings of inadequacy in Taransky that lead him to delete her from his computer's memory.  It does not take much to learn that by doing so, Taransky involves--shall we say--legal difficulties involving her unexpected disappearance.SIMONE is a mixture of satire and humor, with the more serious subtext of cinematic morality thrown in.  In the scenes in which Simone appears in a film-within-a-film, she really seems more like a holographic construct than a fully fleshed human actress.  Just to be sure that there really was an actress who plays Simone, I checked on the IMDB for her name (Rachel Roberts) and sure enough she is real (unless the bio was faked too).  This is not a funny film.  It is a one note extended gag that manages not to be stifling even when the loose ends of Taransky's life are neatly tied up.  Comparisons with Jim Carrey in THE TRUMAN SHOW are inevitable, but Roberts as Simone never deviates from her puppeteer's hands, whereas Carrey as Truman was free to grow and learn some lessons about the way that media shapes public opinion.  In SIMONE, it is Viktor Taransky rather than his creation who learns some hard-earned lessons about the way that reality, at some point, must be based on more than just a shell of perception.

728493,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00007G1YQ,Matthew Horner,"[1, 5]","SIMONE [107 minutes / Rated PG-13 for some sensuality]Andrew Niccol is fascinated by the effects of technology on society. He wrote and directed the underrated 1997 film, ""Gattaca"", which showed how genetic engineering might alter society. It was a chilling and altogether possible vision. He wrote ""The Truman Show"", a dazzling satire of reality TV and our obsession with the media. I am sad to report that his latest effort, ""Simone"", falls flat. The premise is clever, but the script fails to deliver either much excitement or a clear message.Victor Taransky [Al Pacino] is a famous director whose recent string of flops has jeopardized his career. When the star of his latest movie [intended to be his comeback] walks off the set, he his devastated. A few weeks later he receives a package from a lawyer representing the estate of a mad computer programmer Victor barely knew. Inside is a series of disks which will allow him to digitally create an actress. He names her Simone and uses her to replace the star who quit. The digitally altered movie becomes a hit, and Simone becomes a phenomenon. There is a media frenzy, and Victor must decide what to do with a star who doesn't exist.Pacino tries hard to breathe some life into his part, but the script doesn't contain enough witty or satirical material for him to succeed. The usually excellent Catherine Keener has problems with her role as Victor's current boss and ex-wife because it is hard to know what it is about the character that would make Victor want her back. Eliminating this overused subplot altogether might have helped the movie by giving the main theme more room.There are still lots of interesting stories to be told about society's battles with its technological creations. If Niccol decides to continue exploring this subject, I wish him better luck next time.",2,A disappointment from Andrew Niccol,1043539200,"01 26, 2003",2003,1837,"['SIMONE', '[', '107', 'minutes', '/', 'Rated', 'PG-13', 'sensuality', ']', 'Andrew', 'Niccol', 'fascinated', 'effects', 'technology', 'society', 'wrote', 'directed', 'underrated', '1997', 'film', 'Gattaca', 'showed', 'how', 'genetic', 'engineering', 'might', 'alter', 'society', 'was', 'chilling', 'altogether', 'possible', 'vision', 'wrote', 'Truman', 'Show', 'dazzling', 'satire', 'reality', 'TV', 'obsession', 'media', 'am', 'sad', 'report', 'latest', 'effort', 'Simone', 'flat', 'premise', 'clever', 'script', 'deliver', 'either', 'much', 'excitement', 'clear', 'message.Victor', 'Taransky', '[', 'Al', 'Pacino', ']', 'famous', 'director', 'recent', 'string', 'flops', 'jeopardized', 'career', 'When', 'star', 'latest', 'movie', '[', 'intended', 'be', 'comeback', ']', 'set', 'devastated', 'few', 'weeks', 'later', 'package', 'lawyer', 'representing', 'estate', 'mad', 'computer', 'programmer', 'Victor', 'barely', 'knew', 'Inside', 'series', 'disks', 'will', 'allow', 'digitally', 'create', 'actress', 'Simone', 'replace', 'star', 'who', 'quit', 'digitally', 'altered', 'movie', 'hit', 'Simone', 'phenomenon', 'media', 'frenzy', 'Victor', 'must', 'decide', 'what', 'do', 'star', 'who', ""n't"", 'exist.Pacino', 'tries', 'hard', 'breathe', 'life', 'part', 'script', ""n't"", 'contain', 'enough', 'witty', 'satirical', 'material', 'succeed', 'usually', 'excellent', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'problems', 'role', 'Victor', 'current', 'boss', 'ex-wife', 'hard', 'know', 'what', 'character', 'would', 'make', 'Victor', 'want', 'back', 'Eliminating', 'overused', 'subplot', 'altogether', 'might', 'have', 'helped', 'movie', 'giving', 'main', 'theme', 'more', 'room.There', 'are', 'still', 'lots', 'interesting', 'stories', 'be', 'told', 'society', 'battles', 'technological', 'creations', 'Niccol', 'continue', 'exploring', 'subject', 'wish', 'better', 'luck', 'next', 'time']",Simone

I really didn't think it was going to be that good, but I wanted to see it nonetheless because I love Al Pacino.  I feel that no matter how bad a movie can be, as long as Al is in it I will be able to enjoy it on some level.  To my surprise, ""Simone"" was extremely good and is a lot better than what I was led to believe.Viktor Taransky is in deep trouble when his leading actress decides to walk and not do the movie he is currently filming.  The studio isn't very pleased with him and is willing to fire him due to what has just transpired.  Taransky wants to make films, but hates the fact that HE ends up working for the actors when they should be working for him.  Then he is presented with a gift: a simulated superstar who never leaves the computer screen.  Taransky has a new actress and can control her every thought and movement.  Pretty soon the whole world falls in love with the digitalized woman, Simone; unaware that it is all a big hoax.  But alas, what goes up must come down at some point and things quickly get out of control when it seems like the world is doing nothing but worshipping the fake superstar.I was VERY surprised by this movie!  Created by the same man behind ""The Truman Show,"" Andrew Niccol has given us a very clever satire on superstardom and just how far fame can go.  It pokes fun at the fact that we are always quick to worship some kind of icon and that we can go to ridiculous lengths.  The movie was highly entertaining and amazingly funny.  Al Pacino is excellent, as always.  Your eyes never leave the screen when he's on camera, and he can really by funny when he wants to without having to put in too much effort.  Catherine Keener is also great in her role and really knows how to play the part.  The rest of the cast was also very good as well.  The movie was very well written and directed.The DVD has a few neat features to offer.  The picture quality is really crystal clear and the sound is great.  (You even have the choice of watching it in DTS).  The features on the DVD that are included are deleted scenes, two documentaries, a teaser trailer and the original theatrical trailer.  While more features would've been nice, the ones that are on here are just fine.  (You also get the choice of either watching the widescreen or fullscreen version of the film.)""Simone"" is a very creative and entertaining film that really surprised me from start to finish.  I really was surprised with how much I liked it.  This might not have been the best movie to go to a theatre to see, but it is a great one to watch at home.  Filled with great comedy and a clever story, this is a wonderful film that you can watch over and over again.  If you're in the mood for a creative comedy, or a really good Al Pacino flick, ""Simone"" could be the one for you to see.  I am glad I gave it a chance.",4,Surprising and Impressive!

After the lead actress on Viktor Taransky's (Al Pacino) latest movie walks out he's left footing a huge bill, unless he can find a suitable replacement in time.  In steps a crazy computer genius who has created Simulation One, a piece of software that can create a digital actress - Simone - who won't walk out on her film, will always follow her director's guidelines and can also channel equal parts Meryl Streep and Audrey Hepburn through use of a complicated network.What makes Simone so enjoyable is that it's very very clever without sacrificing its humour.  As the attention is shifted away from Taransky and onto Simone, issues of creation versus creator and the fickleness of an audience are brought into play.  Whilst the scales tip and Simone overshadows Taransky, he attempts to sabotage her in interviews and even on film with the deliberately atrocious yet attributed to Simone production I Am Pig.  Here the nature of celebrity is explored in its entireity, even if not in the most surprising way.Al Pacino gives a nicely lighthearted turn as the troubled Taransky and kudos should go to Winona Ryder for sending herself up so well.  Unfortunately, Catherine Keener (so good in Being John Malkovich) isn't given much to work with, but apart from that the casting is pretty much spot-on.  In addition, there are some absolutely hilarious scenes, most involving Taransky's attempt to sabotage Simone by making her say controversial things concerning smoking, immigration and the flavour of dolphin meat.  All of this is great stuff, milked for every penny it's worth.  Whilst the satire might not be as coldly effective as it was in Niccol's previous work Gattaca, it's certainly timely and at the end of the day just plain enjoyable.",4,One of the most pleasing Hollywood satires in ages,1055203200,"06 10, 2003",2003,1852,"['Sadly', 'often', 'case', 'Hollywood', 'unlikely', 'laugh', 'Simone', 'rare', 'example', 'lead', 'actress', 'Viktor', 'Taransky', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'latest', 'movie', 'out', 'left', 'footing', 'huge', 'bill', 'can', 'find', 'suitable', 'replacement', 'time', 'steps', 'crazy', 'computer', 'genius', 'who', 'created', 'Simulation', 'One', 'piece', 'software', 'can', 'create', 'digital', 'actress', 'Simone', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'walk', 'out', 'film', 'will', 'always', 'follow', 'director', 'guidelines', 'can', 'also', 'channel', 'equal', 'parts', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'use', 'complicated', 'network.What', 'Simone', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'very', 'very', 'clever', 'sacrificing', 'humour', 'attention', 'shifted', 'away', 'Taransky', 'Simone', 'issues', 'creation', 'versus', 'creator', 'fickleness', 'audience', 'are', 'brought', 'play', 'scales', 'tip', 'Simone', 'Taransky', 'sabotage', 'interviews', 'even', 'film', 'deliberately', 'atrocious', 'yet', 'attributed', 'Simone', 'production', 'Am', 'Pig', 'Here', 'nature', 'celebrity', 'explored', 'entireity', 'even', 'not', 'most', 'surprising', 'way.Al', 'Pacino', 'nicely', 'lighthearted', 'turn', 'troubled', 'Taransky', 'kudos', 'should', 'go', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'sending', 'so', 'well', 'Unfortunately', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'so', 'good', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'work', 'apart', 'casting', 'pretty', 'much', 'spot-on', 'addition', 'are', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'most', 'involving', 'Taransky', 'attempt', 'sabotage', 'Simone', 'making', 'say', 'controversial', 'things', 'concerning', 'smoking', 'immigration', 'flavour', 'dolphin', 'meat', 'great', 'stuff', 'milked', 'penny', 'worth', 'satire', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'coldly', 'effective', 'was', 'Niccol', 'previous', 'work', 'Gattaca', 'certainly', 'timely', 'end', 'day', 'just', 'plain', 'enjoyable']",Simone

Such is the case with this movie, which examines how one person can use technology, Hollywood and the mass media to create a reality from nothing at all.  Al Pacino plays Victor, a washed-up movie maker who has just lost his big star, played by Winona Ryder.  Out of desperation, he creates a fake movie star named Simone out of a computer program.  He proceeds to film movies starring her, and then turns her into a singing sensation.  Finally, her stardom takes over his life both professional and personal, and he concocts a scheme to remove her.  But this backfires and he ends up jail.  Luckily, someone else has stumbled upon Simone's secret, and resurrects her to save Victor.The plot of the movie is interesting but fairly straight forward.  A careful watch reveals many parodies.  First in line is Winona Ryder playing a spoiled actress, something kicked around the gossip circles for years.  Second is the ridicule of the Hollywood awards industry, and how some of the weirdest movies end up getting major awards.  Third is the transition Simone makes from actress to singer.  This is surely a parody of others who have crossed over, such as Dolly Parton, Jennifer Lopez, Jessica Simpson, Paris Hilton, etc, etc...  And then there is the most subtle parody of all, and that is this story is a remake of the original Frankenstein novel.  A man creates another ""human being"" and this other being takes over the life of the creator.  Being a comedy, this version ends on a happier note.All told, this was quite an interesting movie.

Everything she burps is considered sacred and profound and Pacino even manages to stage a holographic concert, which probably satisfies the virtual guessers in the cast to some degree. However, two reporters are obsessed with both S1m0ne and her Paul Winchell, (Pacino's character Viktor Taransky,) and after Viktor gets sick and tired of his creation getting all the kudos while all he does is speak through her, and he decides to kill off S1m0ne, these two try and expose him as a murderer.I'm not going to ruin the ending for you, but suffice it to say that it's a good thing that Taransky took time out to have a family on his way through Hollywood!Done before, and maybe redone a little better, and a DEFINITE change of pace for Pacino.",4,So much more could have been done with this....,1197849600,"12 17, 2007",2007,1575,"['beautifully', 'photographed', 'decently', 'acted', 'get', 'feeling', 'S1m0ne', 'right', 'cusp', 'something', 'really', 'swift', 'compass', 'heading', 'just', 'thing', 'pops', 'have', 'here', 'essentially', 'Maxine', 'Headroom', 'computer', 'generated', 'character', 'serving', 'media', 'alter', 'ego', 'someone', 'ratings', 'ticket-sale', 'purgatory', 'case', 'S1m0ne', 'DEFINITELY', 'poor', 'sad', 'sack', 'character', 'played', 'Al', 'Too', 'Intense', 'Words', 'Pacino', 'who', 'here', 'untypically', 'mellow', 'just', 'entire', 'picture', 'Pacino', 'unexpected', 'present', 'old', 'colleague', 'Simulation', 'One', 'biggest', 'cash', 'cow', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'anyone', 'ever', 'having', 'seen', 'flesh', 'S1m0ne', 'as', 'big', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'put', 'together', 'digitally', 'edited', 'movies', 'Everything', 'burps', 'considered', 'sacred', 'profound', 'Pacino', 'even', 'stage', 'holographic', 'concert', 'probably', 'virtual', 'guessers', 'cast', 'degree', 'However', 'two', 'reporters', 'are', 'obsessed', 'S1m0ne', 'Paul', 'Winchell', 'Pacino', 'character', 'Viktor', 'Taransky', 'Viktor', 'sick', 'tired', 'creation', 'getting', 'kudos', 'speak', 'kill', 'off', 'S1m0ne', 'two', 'try', 'expose', 'murderer.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'ruin', 'ending', 'say', 'good', 'thing', 'Taransky', 'took', 'time', 'out', 'have', 'family', 'way', 'Hollywood', 'Done', 'maybe', 'redone', 'little', 'better', 'DEFINITE', 'change', 'pace', 'Pacino']",Simone

728508,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00007G1YQ,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 1]","**1/2 Are movie stars an endangered species?  Will they someday become obsolete?  In the past several decades, as filmmakers have come to rely more and more heavily on computer technology to bring their visions to life on screen, there's been a growing suspicion in the film industry that actors might one day become superfluous to the whole moviemaking process.  There might even be some financial incentive for studios to explore this particular option.  After all, why pay actors exorbitant salaries or put up with their temperamental tantrums when all a director need do is push a button and have a computer-simulated person deliver the perfect performance for him?  Could ""actors"" become, in essence, nothing more than ""special effects"" to be inserted into the moviemaker's final product?  Already today, a number of filmmakers, when confronted with having to film scenes involving massive crowds, have opted to forego hiring oodles of expensive extras, relying instead on the computer to supply all the requisite people for them.  Now what would happen if some filmmaker suddenly had the technology necessary to do that with his main characters?  Enter Simone - and all Hollywood gives a collective shudder.""Simone"" is another high concept fantasy by Andrew Niccol, the writer/director who made ""The Truman Show"" a few years back.  Like that earlier film, ""Simone"" is concerned with the issue of reality vs. illusion as it is played out in the modern world of our mass media culture.  ""Simone"" tells the story of a down-on-his-luck film director, Viktor Taransky (Al Pacino) who, fed up with the rampant egotism of the stars he is forced to work with, finds a way to circumvent the problem when a ""madman"" scientist shows him how to create a cybernetic actress named Simone.  Even though she is nothing more than a computer simulation, Simone ends up taking the deluded world by storm, achieving instant celebrity status and rescuing Taransky's faltering career in the process.""Simone"" sounds great on paper, and I am sure that Niccol felt he was really making an incisive satire on both the moviemaking process and the shallowness of American pop culture.  The problem is that ""Simone"" never achieves the level of sophistication in its execution that the premise - and the film's pedigree - would lead us to expect.  We know what we are SUPPOSED to be thinking while watching ""Simone"" - that Hollywood is filled with rampant egotists and phonies, that moviemaking is based on manipulative illusions and that modern audiences are only too willing to fall for and even worship hollow and empty glamour at the expense of the really important things in life - but the heavy handed, humorless way in which the message is delivered robs the film of most of its incisiveness and point.  In fact, there is really not one genuine laugh in the course of the film.  The Hollywood insider stuff is obvious and overdone and much of the humor is of the harried-deceiver-running-around-trying-not-to-get-caught variety.  We even have Viktor setting up a speakerphone ""meeting"" between Simone and her fellow actors, jumping into a golf cart and racing to his computer terminal in a nearby sound stage so that he can ""speak"" for Simone.  The problem is that, apart from the corny slapstick nature of the whole setup, the scene doesn't make any sense anyway since Viktor - as Simone - never interacts conversationally with the actors, but simply delivers a speech to them which could have been prerecorded just as easily as the one he did for Simone to start the meeting with.  Thus, all the madcap running around turns out to be for naught in the final analysis, since it is never even exploited for its own comic effectiveness.  Despite the veneer of originality, almost everything about the film feels conventional and obvious, including the bit about how Victor is desperately trying to win back his ex-wife who just so happens to be one of the heads of the studio for which he works.  (I wonder if Niccol and Woody Allen shared notes on this script, for I could swear that this was the very same storyline for ""Hollywood Ending,"" yet another unsuccessful fantasy about the moviemaking process).  In many ways, Niccol, as a writer, is as tied to phoniness and conventionality as the industry he is attempting to deride.  And the ending, though ""clever,"" completely violates the theme - of the importance of truth and integrity - that the filmmaker has been working towards all along.Pacino, despite the fact that he is often required to look a bit foolish as the madly racing around, harried director, ends up delivering a generally warm and sympathetic performance, managing to keep the character life-sized in the face of all the larger-than-life nonsense that is going on around him.  Catherine Keener, one of the most compelling actresses working in films today, makes of his ex-wife a woman of wit, intelligence and compassion.Thanks to cinematographers Derek Grover and Edward Lachman, Niccol brings a sharp, burnished look to the film.  The movie seems to be bathed in a kind of warm golden light, enhancing the slightly otherworldly quality Niccol's fantasy scenario demands.Yet, it is that scenario itself that, ultimately, spells defeat for ""Simone.""  One appreciates the attempt to try something a little ""different,"" but Niccol is simply not able to bring it all together in this particular instance.  Yes,  ""Simone"" fails at a higher level than the average Hollywood movie, but it is still, alas, a failure.  Given a more sophisticated treatment, this ""high concept"" effort could have been a real knockout.",2,"interesting premise, weak execution",1030752000,"08 31, 2002",2002,5612,"['**1/2', 'Are',

728509,A1NDYXBX0IAUAY,B00007G1YQ,Ronald L. Russell,"[9, 9]","This is a very smart, funny, and observant film about Hollywood, the media in general, and the public, and how they manipulate each other. Al Pacino plays Viktor Taransky, a film director who has made some good films in the past, but has a difficult time dealing with the childish whims of spoiled stars. When his current leading lady Nichola Anders (Winona Ryder) walks off the set, the studio pulls the plug on his latest project, and Viktor finds himself suddenly struggling to keep his career alive, He receives a computer program from a fan which allows him to create a virtual actress, who he names Sim One, or Simone, who he then digitally inserts into all the scenes which Nichola had formerly occupied, and finishes his film. The film (titled ""Sunrise, Sunset"") opens to astonishing reviews, and everyone wants to know about this new starlet. Viktor is concerned about maintaining the illusion that Simone is an actual person, so much of the rest of the movie is devoted to providing necessary media exposure for Simone, while concealing the fact that she doesn't really exist outside of a computer. Viktor cleverly arranges for remote interviews on popular talk shows, even a ""live"" (actually holographic) concert appearance. One very funny sequence involves arranging for Simone to be seen driving in freeway traffic, and conversing with Viktors ex-wife Elaine, who is driving in an adjacent car. In another scene, Viktor simulates spending an evening with Simone in a posh hotel, knowing that papparazzi are outside waiting for any glimpse of her. He thus cleverly links himself to Simone even more closely in the media spotlight, and enhances his own fame. Simones second film (""Eternity Forever"") only increases the adoration which the public and the media hold for her. A funny inside joke takes place at the awards ceremony following the second film, where the three actresses who were nominated besides Simone all have computer names (Claris Apple, Lisa Packard, and Lotus Corel). A similar joke was to be included in the credits for ""Sunrise, Sunset"", which unfortunately, was cut from the theatrical release, but is included in the special features of the DVD. As the credits roll, everyone connected with the film other than Simone has the name of a computer or software company. There is also a very humorous sub-plot in which suspicious journalists from a newsmagazine called ""The Echo"" stalk Viktor in an attempt to uncover the truth about Simone. Certain that Viktor is hiding something, their efforts are marred by one of them liking Simone just a little bit TOO much. Although they collect a lot of ""evidence"", they overlook the obvious conclusion.As the deception continues, Viktors lies about Simone begin to take on a life of their own. Gradually, Viktor begins to exhibit signs of schizophrenia, as he provides the voice (suitably modulated by computer) for Simone, and he begins having two-sided conversations with Simone. Eventually, ""her"" personality begins to diverge from his, and demonstrates the beginnings of independence. Viktor tries to tell the truth to his ex-wife, Elaine (with whom he hopes to reconcile), but when he tells her that he made Simone, she replies ""No Viktor, she made you"". At this point, Viktor decides it is time to end Simones career, and he makes a film intended to ruin her in the public eye (""I Am Pig""). His plan backfires and the audiences view the film as an emotially moviing work of the highest calibre. He sabotages her appearance on another talk show, making her look something like Courtney Love and having her say controversial, intentionally unpopular things (such as ""God created furry animals to be worn""), but nothing he does can make the public dislike Simone. In desperation, Viktor announces that she has died, and subsequently finds himself charged with her murder.Attempts to clear his name meet with failure, and only the intervention of his computer-savvy daughter save Viktor from certain conviction and likely execution, given Simones popularity.Al Pacino plays Viktor as an experienced, and perhaps somewhat weary, but brilliant master of his craft. In his mind, the director and the studio makes the star by providing them a means of expression in film. But he feels that  stars mock their directors and studios, and so he seizes the opportunity to use someone like Simone to create his masterpieces. Rachel Roberts is absolutely luminous as Simone, and I hope to see her in other films. She is simply amazing. Very high marks also to Evan Rachel Wood, who played Viktors daughter Lainey, smart, cute, and emotionally mature beyond her years. Winona Ryder is great as Nichola Anders, the spoiled star who walks off the set, but returns later to read for a part as a supporting character in a movie with Simone. She does get a chance to show a small sample of her genuine acting ability, and it is impressive.The film pokes good natured fun at Hollywood and the media, and also makes some good points about the manner in which some stars become almost gods, worshipped by millions of fans, and how people are inclined to make very favorable assumptions about those who they adore.This was a VERY funny film, full of sly irony, well-written and well-acted, which deserved to do better at the theatres. That it didn't do better is probably because most of the humor is more of a subtle, intellectual sort, and I suspect many of the jokes went over the heads of much of the audience, i.e. many probably just didn't ""get"" the joke mentioned above involving the names of the other actresses at the awards ceremony. This is not a ""National Lampoon"" sort of film at all.Rather, ""Simone"" is as nearly a perfect comedy as I can recall ever seeing. The only improvement I can think of would have been to leave in some of the deleted scenes (however, I suppose the decision was made to prevent the film from being too long, as it is nearly two hours AFTER being cut. The DVD includes almost 20 deleted scenes, so it would have been a very long film had they not been cut). In addition to the deleted scenes, the special features also includes two trailers, and two documentaries on the making of ""Simone"", including interviews with Rachel Roberts, and others connected with the film. I am very pleased to have this DVD.

Those viewers who think Hollywood movie stars are something special, instead of the ordinary people they often are, will probably be somewhat offended by Niccol's treatment of the adoring public for Simone, a computer generated actress who is sold to the public as a real person by director Viktor Taransky -- Al Pacino.Those viewers who find the amount of space and time spent paying attention to the comings and goings of celebrities foolish and absurd will laugh out loud at the response of the public to Taransky's attempts to keep the real identity of Simone a secret.  The major part of the film is taken up with the technical wizardy Taransky uses to deceive the public about the true identity of Simone.  Its a stretch of the imagination to believe the public could be so stupid, but that's the point of the film.Some reviewers have rightly complained that director Niccol sells out by giving us a happy ending which is not faithful to the story line.  Niccol takes the easy way out, not the best way out, which would have been more difficult for a general audience to accept.  So in the end, Niccol becomes just what he satirizes.  He satisfies what he believes his audience wants instead of being true to his artistic vision.Even so, I found Simone entertaining, if not competely satisfying.

This IS a nice movie, with a lot more depth than one would have imagined for the premise. I really thought Hollywood might screw up a great idea. They usually do.Read the other reviews for praise. Mine is just to throw in a few extras. Kudos for the portrayal of the media masses swarming like sharks to ferret out the private life of a new celebrity actress, who exists only in a digital reality.Pacino - superb as the down-trodden producer. Looks younger at the beginning of the film, and as Simone (his computer generated protege played by Rachel Roberts), wins the film world, his appearence ages as the stress of maintaining the facade takes its toll. There is a poignant moment in the film, when Pacino is creating Simone's voice in a taped interview. In that moment, he makes you realize he loves his creation, and at the same time, becomes aware of his own underlying Hollywood narcissism as Simone is as an extention of his own personality and creativity.Wynnona Ryder surprised the hell out of me with a great 60 second performance. When she comes back to audition for a part as the sister of Simone in a future film, she makes Pacino realize that he has lost his human touch, in creating a digital starlette.As to the Hollywood stereotypes; There is the logical father/daughter connection. The Hollywood CEO wife who re-identifies with her washed out husband/producer. There is the empotional rediscovery beteween said wife and producer.But in all, it is Pacino who is the focus of the film (I would have thought Simone would have dominated, and thank you for letting Pacino's angst control the pace...).A DVD well worth renting and watching several times.

Its a smoke fest. Its just a big tobacco company endorsement. Ironic when you consider that Pacino starred in the Insider - an Excellent movie about tobacco industry whistle blower Dr. Jeffery Wigand. For those who care about their children viewing images of adults smoking as if it was a safe pastime, this film is on the AVOID list.This movie had an interesting enough premise but the really lame CGI and totallack of technological believability makes anyone with any computer knowledge sit theresaying ""that's ridiculous!"" and ""They expect us to believe that?"" the whole time. On the one hand we're supposed to believe Sim-One is so advanced that it can produce a realistic woman who can pass for a living person, but on the other hand the technology is so un-advanced that she can be stored on a bunch of 1.4 floppy disks???? And since when can you instantly remove a virus by simply ejecting the disk the virus software was on?The effects are so bad, Simone is only one step above Max Headroom when she's in the computer and I was half expecting him to co-star in the next movie with her! And are we supposed to believe that Pacino's character is such a computer wiz that he can do CGI rendering of a believable looking human so fast that he could churn out 2 whole films with this character in one year? I don't think ILM can do that! The effects are lame and the story is pretty stupid. It barely gets a chuckle even when it is supposed to be funny.Its a shame.

Al Pacino's take on this role was delightful as well as the rest of the cast.Viktor Taransky (Pacino) comes to a dead end after an actress drops the deal to star in his film production. Being that she was too picky and very demanding on many certain aspects, he had no last resort. His last three films were not highly acclaimed as his previous work. He needed an overnight delivery of an amazing talent, which he indeed did receive unexpectedly.Simone was everything plus gorgeous, and the little scene with a clip from Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's was adorable. Everyone easily fell in love with this singer, actress, model, but little did they know Viktor was the joke behind all of it.Eventually, the movie led to guilt. And when living a lie, you're practically dead. All of life then has no meaning now, unless you open up to the truth and start all over. There isn't much clarity in those statements, but if you see the film, you might have a better idea of what is being said. Though Simone was virtually created by Viktor, she may have been a fake, but more real than most people today. It's a mockery of all of us, and a tease for Hollywood and the press.

728517,AWJKA0TRZLZGS,B00007G1YQ,Thomas Bailey,"[0, 1]","I cannot say much more than what anybody else has said already. I avoided the movie in the theatre because it didn't seem like it would be much: A superficial movie with a gimmick. - Upon renting and watching it, I was pleasantly surprised. I liked this movie all the way through. I was very moved. Mesmerized. I found one reviewer that thought this movie was terrible. I disagree - but it only goes to show that everyone sees things differently. I was able to suspend disbelief and go into the movie.Wonderful story; I rarely give any movie five stars. Although technology is not there yet, perhaps it will be some day, that didn't matter to me. To explain this movie is difficult. Yes, I can tell you the plot - but there is something special about it that is very difficult to explain. The one person who didn't like it - and I am sure there are others - seemed to have missed that specialness altogether.I didn't see it as being a comedy - although discussed by others in that vein. Al Pacino was great. I didn't find anyone, including him, flat. The way something artificial becomes a star accepted by everyone as a real person, the way even the movie director Viktor Taransky (Al Pacino) finds himself relating to her (as if he is relating to a part of himself, as if he is having a relationship with his creation), is interesting. It is a kind of a love story: Everyone in love with a fantasy.Although not real, she has taken on a life of her own. I have heard of writers saying that about characters they have created. - And here, that is what happens to Taransky. This is about what happens to Taransky, and to everyone who grows to love a character that no matter what he tries to do - when it comes to a point that she is gaining recognition and not he - they still love her.I am not going to tell you where this all goes and how it ends: That's part of the enjoyment of this film. Will you like this film? If you can allow yourself to become immersed, yes. If you need to look at it and say the dialogue falls short, the acting is this, the storyline is not plausible, no - you probably won't enjoy it as much as I.When it comes to buying movies, I am very particular, and I don't know if I would buy it because I am more likely to buy very old films or special effects movies like Spider-man, Lord of the Rings, etc. So, it really depends on what kind of movies you like.

The perfect actress who doesn't complain about the huge trailer you took trouble to prepare; who doesn't require 10 packs of cigarettes (with 3 opened); and who doesn't command $20 million like you know who?  What if a director whose works turned flops these ten years find that chance?  &quot;Simome&quot; (more precisely &quot;S1m0ne&quot;) gives a good idea, and stops there.The film director in point is Viktor Taransky (mixture of Talkovkey and Tarantino) played by Al Pacino.  Now his new project is dead because of the egoistic star Nicola (Winona Ryder), but he is given a computer program by an ailing programmer.  9 months later, Viktor is back in glory, with a new star everyone admires but nobody knew until then -- Simone.As Viktor tries to hide her secret, her popularity ironically rises to worldwide fame.  Trying to fend off the inquisitive press and his ex-wife and producer Elaine (Catherine Keener), Viktor keeps the show going on ... but where he is going to?And where?  The satire is there, but that doesn't bite, lacking new and original angle to tackle the issue of celebrity and movie industry.  Director Andrew Niccol's detached approach to the Hollywood system leaves the audience wondering why this movie is made.  Actually, what the film shows is very conventional, including the conclusion that is too good to be true.But more damaging thing about the film is, I think, that for all its quirky charm of Carter Burwell's music, the film doesn't look real and compelling at all.  I don't know whether  choice of model-turned-actress Rachel Roberts as Simone can be justified.  The film shows that people in India and Japan love her, disregarding cultural differences, but that is ok.  But if you see Al Pacino, who didn't look like a guy who was sitting  before computer, suddenly starts to handle the keyboard and manipulate the various images of Simone, we begin to  disbelieve.  When he announces Simone is agoraphobia before the people, and then she suddenly appears in a concert (in a big place, of course), we won't believe that at all (hey, someone must sense something is wrong!).The &quot;story&quot; of &quot;Simone&quot; in short needs more details.  If you want to tell a story, tell it better.And finally about special effects.  Those who bought recent DVDs (of &quot;Matrix&quot; or whatever) must know that any good CGIs require skilled people's efforts and time.  Many fans now know that, and that kind of knowledge on our side will perhaps reduce the film's credibility.  My low rating comes on this score.  But of course, if the satire had been given more cutting-edge ... well, I said about that already.",2,This Final Fantasy Doesn't Bite,1063843200,"09 18, 2003",2003,2750,"['Everyone', 'would', 'admit', 'idea', 'brilliant', 'What', 'create', '100', '%', 'computer-generated', 'actress', 'perfect', 'actress', 'who', ""n't"", 'complain', 'huge', 'trailer', 'took', 'trouble', 'prepare', 'who', ""n't"", 'require', '10', 'packs', 'cigarettes', '3', 'opened', 'who', ""n't"", 'command', '20', 'million', 'know', 'who', 'What', 'director', 'works', 'turned', 'flops', 'ten', 'years', 'find', 'chance', 'quot', 'Simome', 'quot', 'more', 'precisely', 'quot', 'S1m0ne', 'quot', 'good', 'idea', 'there.The', 'film', 'director', 'point', 'Viktor', 'Taransky', 'mixture', 'Talkovkey', 'Tarantino', 'played', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Now', 'new', 'project', 'dead', 'egoistic', 'star', 'Nicola', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'given', 'computer', 'program', 'ailing', 'programmer', '9', 'months', 'later', 'Viktor', 'back', 'glory', 'new', 'star', 'everyone', 'nobody', 'knew', 'then', 'Simone.As', 'Viktor', 'hide', 'secret', 'popularity', 'ironically', 'worldwide', 'fame', 'Trying', 'fend', 'off', 'inquisitive', 'press', 'ex-wife', 'producer', 'Elaine', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'Viktor', 'show', 'going', 'where', 'going', 'where', 'satire', 'there', ""n't"", 'bite', 'lacking', 'new', 'original', 'angle', 'tackle', 'issue', 'celebrity', 'movie', 'industry', 'Director', 'Andrew', 'Niccol', 'detached', 'approach', 'Hollywood', 'system', 'audience', 'wondering', 'why', 'movie', 'made', 'Actually', 'what', 'film', 'shows', 'very', 'conventional', 'including', 'conclusion', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true.But', 'more', 'damaging', 'thing', 'film', 'think', 'quirky', 'charm', 'Carter', 'Burwell', 'music', 'film', ""n't"", 'look', 'real', 'compelling', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'choice', 'model-turned-actress', 'Rachel', 'Roberts', 'Simone', 'can', 'be', 'justified', 'film', 'people', 'India', 'Japan', 'love', 'disregarding', 'cultural', 'differences', 'ok', 'see', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'sitting', 'computer', 'suddenly', 'handle', 'keyboard', 'manipulate', 'various', 'images', 'Simone', 'begin', 'disbelieve', 'When', 'Simone', 'agoraphobia', 'people', 'then', 'suddenly', 'concert', 'big', 'place', 'course', 'wo', ""n't"", 'believe', 'hey', 'someone', 'must', 'sense', 'something', 'wrong', '.The', 'quot', 'story', 'quot', 'quot', 'Simone', 'quot', 'short', 'needs', 'more', 'details', 'want', 'tell', 'story', 'tell', 'better.And', 'finally', 'special', 'effects', 'who', 'bought', 'recent', 'DVDs', 'quot', 'Matrix', 'quot', 'must', 'know', 'good', 'CGIs', 'require', 'skilled', 'people', 'efforts', 'time', 'Many', 'fans', 'now', 'know', 'kind', 'knowledge', 'side', 'will', 'perhaps', 'reduce', 'film', 'credibility', 'low', 'rating', 'score', 'course', 'satire', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'more', 'cutting-edge', 'well', 'said', 'already']",Simone

There are photos, movie footage, interviews - everything. What's not real?Everything, of course. Computer imagery isn't there yet, but will be soon, and Hollywood's whole business consists of creating reality from nothing or less. Pacino's Victor Taransky just creates it from less than most. Then, recreating an eerily familiar phenomenon, the image turns into a pop-culture goddess. Pure imagery takes on a life of its own - just a half-step beyond what happens in the tabloids today. So, when Taransky tries to end that life, the world (or at least the police) turn on him. I found the ending a surprise, but one with gut-wrenching reality to it. Again echoing Wag the Dog, the movie's final comment on what's real and what's not extends into the world of politics, too.Although clever and ironic in itself, this movie wouldn't be half what it is without Pacino. His character is complex, eager, desperate, cocky, fearful, and more - just as any credible person would be in pulling a major scam, always on the edge of discovery. When a good concept comes together with lots of fine performances, movies like this turn into something quite remarkable.
