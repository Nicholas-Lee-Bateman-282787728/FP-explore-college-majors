906854,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B0009JFDFO,Anyechka,"[4, 9]","This short little film really goes a great job at taking the viewer inside of the life of Susie Rubin.  Even though on the surface she looks and acts mentally retarded, as we come to know her through the film, we come to see that she's pretty much a normal autistic person.  She was considered to be retarded till the age of thirteen, but after she was diagnosed with autism, given an IQ test, and introduced to facilitated communication, she really came out of her shell.  Though she doesn't have Asperger's, the highest-functioning form of autism, she is still very intelligent and articulate.  A generation or so ago, before all of the breakthroughs in educating and treating people with autism spectrum disorders, it would have been considered impossible for a woman like Sue to attend college and do very well there, nor to be able to enter the workforce as she plans to do, being an advocate and counselor for others with autism.  It's amazing that this intelligent articulate person was able to be reached and brought to near-full potential after having been untreated and considered at the level of a two year old for 13 years, that her brain hadn't atrophied from lack of stimulation and the proper treatment.  Although, as anyone familiar with autism spectrum disorders knows, most autistic people do have remarkable intelligence, even if it's in just one area, an intelligence that one doesn't often see in ""normal"" people.  Susie admits that she does contribute to the image of her being retarded instead of autistic by constantly carrying around plastic spoons and zoning out while playing with them in the water, and knows that she doesn't need to do this, but says that the spoons are like her security blanket.  Is that any less rational than a non-autistic person who might constantly wear a lucky piece of jewelry or carry around a lucky penny in one's pocket even though s/he knows s/he doesn't need to do this?Even in spite of all of her progress and capabilities, however, we also see how Susie sometimes feels overwhelmed or trapped because she can't always fully express herself and does have limitations in what she can and can't do.  Her friends and caregivers, as good as they are, also can't deal with all of her frustrations, as evidenced by their seemingly angry and annoyed reaction when she wonders why she should have to suffer just because they're leaving her soon, as though she didn't have the right to feel abandoned and crummy and it were unreasonable that she used some rather strong language when she raised this issue that obviously was very important to her.  And as for the naysayers who are convinced this film is some sort of propaganda, we see over and over again throughout the film that Susie is typing on her own.  She only needs the other person to hold the typing device for her.  No one is holding her hand or finger or doing the typing for her.  Facilitated communication has brought so many autistic people out of the darkness and into the light, enabled them to finally express themselves and communicate with the rest of the human race, unburden themselves of all of the things they had been dying to get out their entire lives.  It has done for them what Braille did for the blind, what Sign Language did for the Deaf, and what the finger alphabet did for the blind-deaf--allowed them to experience the joy of expressing themselves and being understood and communicated with in return, instead of being considered unreachable and stupid just because they weren't able to communicate in the ""normal"" way.  Of course there may be those who are unscrupulous enough to have abused facilitated communication, but the facts speak for themselves, that there are far more success stories than there are stories of fakery.  My only complaint about the film is that it's only 39 and a half minutes long.  As good as it is and as much ground as it covers in that relatively short amount of time, I just wish it had been longer so we could have gotten to know and understand even more about Susie and her world.",5,A journey inside a secret world,1172016000,"02 21, 2007",2007,4055,"['short', 'little', 'film', 'really', 'great', 'job', 'taking', 'viewer', 'life', 'Susie', 'Rubin', 'Even', 'surface', 'mentally', 'retarded', 'come', 'know', 'film', 'come', 'see', 'pretty', 'much', 'normal', 'autistic', 'person', 'was', 'considered', 'be', 'retarded', 'age', 'thirteen', 'was', 'diagnosed', 'autism', 'given', 'IQ', 'test', 'introduced', 'facilitated', 'communication', 'really', 'came', 'shell', ""n't"", 'have', 'Asperger', 'highest-functioning', 'form', 'autism', 'still', 'very', 'intelligent', 'articulate', 'generation', 'so', 'ago', 'breakthroughs', 'educating', 'treating', 'people', 'autism', 'spectrum', 'disorders', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'impossible', 'woman', 'Sue', 'attend', 'college', 'do', 'very', 'well', 'there', 'be', 'able', 'enter', 'workforce', 'do', 'being', 'advocate', 'counselor', 'others', 'autism', 'amazing', 'intelligent', 'articulate', 'person', 'was', 'able', 'be', 'reached', 'brought', 'near-full', 'potential', 'having', 'been', 'untreated', 'considered', 'level', 'two', 'year', 'old', '13', 'years', 'brain', 'had', ""n't"", 'atrophied', 'lack', 'stimulation', 'proper', 'treatment', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'autism', 'spectrum', 'disorders', 'most', 'autistic', 'people', 'do', 'have', 'remarkable', 'intelligence', 'even', 'just', 'one', 'area', 'intelligence', 'one', ""n't"", 'often', 'see', 'normal', 'people', 'Susie', 'contribute', 'image', 'being', 'retarded', 'instead', 'autistic', 'constantly', 'carrying', 'around', 'plastic', 'spoons', 'zoning', 'out', 'playing', 'water', ""n't"", 'need', 'do', 'spoons', 'are', 'security', 'blanket', 'less', 'rational', 'non-autistic', 'person', 'who', 'might', 'constantly', 'wear', 'lucky', 'piece', 'jewelry', 'carry', 'lucky', 'penny', 'one', 'pocket', 'even', 's/he', 'knows', 's/he', ""n't"", 'need', 'do', 'Even', 'spite', 'progress', 'capabilities', 'however', 'also', 'see', 'how', 'Susie', 'sometimes', 'overwhelmed', 'trapped', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'fully', 'express', 'have', 'limitations', 'what', 'can', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'Her', 'friends', 'caregivers', 'as', 'good', 'are', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deal', 'frustrations', 'evidenced', 'seemingly', 'angry', 'annoyed', 'reaction', 'when', 'why', 'should', 'have', 'suffer', 'just', ""'re"", 'leaving', 'soon', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'right', 'feel', 'abandoned', 'crummy', 'were', 'unreasonable', 'used', 'rather', 'strong', 'language', 'when', 'raised', 'issue', 'obviously', 'was', 'very', 'important', 'naysayers', 'who', 'are', 'convinced', 'film', 'sort', 'propaganda', 'see', 'over', 'again', 'film', 'Susie', 'typing', 'own', 'only', 'other', 'person', 'hold', 'typing', 'device', 'one', 'holding', 'hand', 'finger', 'doing', 'typing', 'Facilitated', 'communication', 'brought', 'so', 'many', 'autistic', 'people', 'darkness', 'light', 'enabled', 'finally', 'express', 'communicate', 'rest', 'human', 'race', 'unburden', 'things', 'had', 'been', 'dying', 'get', 'out', 'entire', 'lives', 'done', 'what', 'Braille', 'did', 'blind', 'what', 'Sign', 'Language', 'did', 'Deaf', 'what', 'finger', 'alphabet', 'did', 'blind-deaf', 'allowed', 'experience', 'joy', 'expressing', 'being', 'understood', 'communicated', 'return', 'instead', 'being', 'considered', 'unreachable', 'stupid', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'able', 'communicate', 'normal', 'way', 'course', 'may', 'be', 'who', 'are', 'unscrupulous', 'enough', 'have', 'abused', 'facilitated', 'communication', 'facts', 'speak', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'success', 'stories', 'are', 'stories', 'fakery', 'only', 'complaint', 'film', 'only', '39', 'half', 'minutes', 'long', 'As', 'good', 'as', 'much', 'ground', 'relatively', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'longer', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'know', 'understand', 'even', 'more', 'Susie', 'world']",Autism is a World - CNN
906855,AIEEK7AHXKZCC,B0009JFDFO,BeatleBangs1964,"[10, 20]","People with autism have communication difficulties based on the severity of their autism.  Sue Rubin and her alleged use of Faciliated Communication (FC) remains open to discussion and questions, lots of questions.Ms. Rubin was diagnosed with retardation at the age of 3 and spent years in special programs.  Sadly, she does appear to be cognitively delayed - her physical appearance and behavior lends itself readily to that assumption.  This is not to say that she is, but her delayed development included does support that finding.I take issue with the statement that autism is a ""world;"" sadly, for too many generations the misperception about people with autism inhabiting their isolated worlds has proven costly.  For the most part, people with autism want to communicate as that is an innate need and want to be a part of what others are doing, but lack the social and/or linguistic tools to make it work consistently.  I am tired of the claim that people with autism are ""in another world;"" that kind of thinking reinforces negative stereotypes about people with the condition and dodges the underlying causes for the behaviors.I have seen Ms. Rubin on television with her facilitator and many was the time when it looked as if the facilitator was doing all the typing and all the work for her.  Ms. Rubin's verbal skills appear to be quite limited and that adds to the question of the veracity of FC.  The story closes on an upbeat note with Ms. Rubin enrolled in college courses with her facilitator at her side.  However, Ms. Rubin cannot live independently and requires many services and a lot of help in basic needs, such as dressing, housecleaning and shopping.At this time, FC has not been proven scientifically; it remains question of great debate and speculation.  In some reported instances, FC has been uncovered as the work of the facilitator only.  That is not to say this is the case in re Ms. Rubin; it is to ponder the question.  The American Psychological Association website also upholds these doubts about FC and so do many experts who have specialized in autism and other communication issues.In watching Ms. Rubin, she does not appear to type independently; the few key strokes she makes are not the length of the highly sophisticated sentences her facilitator ""reads"" for her.  I do worry that this is a Feast of Dreams/Illusions that holds out false hope.  For anybody who has watched this documentary, please do some research on FC as it remains a questionable method.",2,Welcome to Our World,1152230400,"07 7, 2006",2006,2500,"['People', 'autism', 'have', 'communication', 'difficulties', 'based', 'severity', 'autism', 'Sue', 'Rubin', 'alleged', 'use', 'Faciliated', 'Communication', 'FC', 'open', 'discussion', 'questions', 'lots', 'questions.Ms', 'Rubin', 'was', 'diagnosed', 'retardation', 'age', '3', 'spent', 'years', 'special', 'programs', 'Sadly', 'appear', 'be', 'cognitively', 'delayed', 'physical', 'appearance', 'behavior', 'lends', 'readily', 'assumption', 'not', 'say', 'delayed', 'development', 'included', 'support', 'finding.I', 'take', 'issue', 'statement', 'autism', 'world', 'sadly', 'too', 'many', 'generations', 'misperception', 'people', 'autism', 'inhabiting', 'isolated', 'worlds', 'proven', 'costly', 'most', 'part', 'people', 'autism', 'want', 'communicate', 'innate', 'need', 'want', 'be', 'part', 'what', 'others', 'are', 'doing', 'lack', 'social', 'and/or', 'linguistic', 'tools', 'make', 'work', 'consistently', 'am', 'tired', 'claim', 'people', 'autism', 'are', 'world', 'kind', 'thinking', 'reinforces', 'negative', 'stereotypes', 'people', 'condition', 'underlying', 'causes', 'behaviors.I', 'have', 'seen', 'Ms.', 'Rubin', 'television', 'facilitator', 'many', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'looked', 'facilitator', 'was', 'doing', 'typing', 'work', 'Ms.', 'Rubin', 'verbal', 'skills', 'appear', 'be', 'quite', 'limited', 'question', 'veracity', 'FC', 'story', 'upbeat', 'note', 'Ms.', 'Rubin', 'enrolled', 'college', 'courses', 'facilitator', 'side', 'However', 'Ms.', 'Rubin', 'can', 'not', 'live', 'independently', 'many', 'services', 'lot', 'help', 'basic', 'needs', 'such', 'dressing', 'housecleaning', 'shopping.At', 'time', 'FC', 'not', 'been', 'proven', 'scientifically', 'question', 'great', 'debate', 'speculation', 'reported', 'instances', 'FC', 'been', 'uncovered', 'work', 'facilitator', 'only', 'not', 'say', 'case', 're', 'Ms.', 'Rubin', 'ponder', 'question', 'American', 'Psychological', 'Association', 'website', 'also', 'doubts', 'FC', 'so', 'do', 'many', 'experts', 'who', 'have', 'specialized', 'autism', 'other', 'communication', 'issues.In', 'watching', 'Ms.', 'Rubin', 'not', 'appear', 'type', 'independently', 'few', 'key', 'strokes', 'are', 'not', 'length', 'highly', 'sophisticated', 'sentences', 'facilitator', 'reads', 'do', 'worry', 'Feast', 'Dreams/Illusions', 'out', 'false', 'hope', 'anybody', 'who', 'watched', 'documentary', 'please', 'do', 'research', 'FC', 'questionable', 'method']",Autism is a World - CNN

I'm 26 years old,"" begins this moving 40-minute documentary where all the horrors as well as talents of this brain disorder are revealed. Originally cataloged by psychiatrist Bleuler in 1912, such qualities include the essential feelings of oddity and aloneness felt by Sue which slightly improve as her brain evolves, through the help of a keyboard, that dictates her thoughts, as well as the  life-saving help she receives by her constant support system, and a 24/7 compassionate aide.It's bad enough to be born with a mind that works unlike any other, but Sue's physical appearance is also an anomaly. Her immense courage and family support has propelled her out of her house and into the world at large where she ventures daily, hurtling obstacles impossible for the uninitiated to appreciate. She lives by herself with her paid companion and attends college where she is matriculating in history.To call her heroic is an understatement, as is her mother's comment that seeing one's child so burdened is heartbreaking. Yet, making use of massive government funding and newly available technology, Sue finds joy and meaning in her life and serves as a true inspiration to others in her situation.A must-see movie for those, like myself, who have autism in the family (my brother) or for professionals or for the compassionate observer of life gone awry, yet salvaged through determination and helpmates.",5,A Difficult Journey Through Life,1169856000,"01 27, 2007",2007,1429,"['name', 'Sue', 'Rubin', ""'m"", '26', 'years', 'old', 'moving', '40-minute', 'documentary', 'where', 'horrors', 'as', 'well', 'talents', 'brain', 'disorder', 'are', 'revealed', 'Originally', 'cataloged', 'psychiatrist', 'Bleuler', '1912', 'such', 'qualities', 'include', 'essential', 'feelings', 'oddity', 'aloneness', 'felt', 'Sue', 'slightly', 'improve', 'brain', 'evolves', 'help', 'keyboard', 'thoughts', 'as', 'well', 'life-saving', 'help', 'constant', 'support', 'system', '24/7', 'compassionate', 'aide.It', 'bad', 'enough', 'be', 'born', 'mind', 'other', 'Sue', 'physical', 'appearance', 'also', 'anomaly', 'immense', 'courage', 'family', 'support', 'propelled', 'house', 'world', 'large', 'where', 'ventures', 'daily', 'hurtling', 'obstacles', 'impossible', 'uninitiated', 'appreciate', 'paid', 'companion', 'college', 'where', 'matriculating', 'history.To', 'call', 'heroic', 'understatement', 'mother', 'comment', 'seeing', 'one', 'child', 'so', 'burdened', 'heartbreaking', 'making', 'use', 'massive', 'government', 'funding', 'newly', 'available', 'technology', 'Sue', 'joy', 'meaning', 'life', 'true', 'inspiration', 'others', 'situation.A', 'must-see', 'movie', 'who', 'have', 'autism', 'family', 'brother', 'professionals', 'compassionate', 'observer', 'life', 'gone', 'awry', 'yet', 'salvaged', 'determination', 'helpmates']",Autism is a World - CNN
906857,A2RWHTNM5P3I8Y,B0009JFDFO,Sheryl Katz,"[77, 128]","I saw this movie on TV a week ago, and it troubled me deeply. Purportedly it was written by an autistic woman named Sue Rubin, and it tells her story.  It is either the heartwarming story of a woman locked in a prison of autism until she was rescued by assisted communication.  Or, she is still a retarded, autistic, uncommunicative person being manipulated by her family and some academic supporters of assisted to communications to appear as a genius, a sort of autistic Helen Keller.It disturbed me enough that I did quite a bit of research since I've seen it, and I am left with the conclusion that this movie is a piece of propaganda for a highly controversial view of autism.  It tells a very one-sided story, and in the end I find myself unconvinced and concerned that parents of autistic children are being misled.  I am giving this movie two, rather than one, star because it does what it set out to do well.  I am only giving it two stars because it is so misleading.  It certainly leaves way too many questions unanswered.On the surface this is the story of Sue Rubin a 26 year old college student at Whittier college.  Sue Rubin looks and sounds retarded as well as autistic.  Until she was 13 she was considered to have a mental age of three.  Then, with the aid of something called ""assisted communication"" which involves an aid holding her hand while she types on a keyboard, she gradually blossomed into someone with an IQ over 130.  She is still autistic; she is still severely handicapped; she still cannot perform basic functions, but she can read and write and learn.  She graduated high school and she goes to college.Now, at the first mention of assisted communication,the movie says ""controversial assisted communication.""  It never elucidates.  It never explains.  It just goes from there.Controversial?  Here's where I was driven to do research.  The community of people who work with autistics are seriously split over this issue.  Many experiments demonstrate that assisted communication in the case of autistics may be little more than (as one critic said) ""using autistic people as a ouija board.""  There is no doubt that assisted communication is real with respect to some handicapped people such as those suffering from cerebral palsy, but there is serious doubt that it is effective with autistics.So here's where this movie really troubled me.  Is Sue Rubin for real? Or is her ""progress"" an illusion, a combination of wishful thinking from her family and overzealous advocacy by academics with an axe to grind?  The movie never raises or acknowledges this question let alone answers it. It assumes she is ""real.""  Yet, it just isn't possible to tell from the movie.  Did Sue Rubin really write it?  or Did a well-meaning care giver guide her had to write it?  Is it really Sue Rubin communicating, or is it her care-givers?I don't know.  I can't tell.  I can't tell from this movie and I can't tell from what I read on the web.On the one hand Sue Rubin supposedly tested over 1300 on the SAT.  I'm sure that she had unlimited time, and I'm sure that her caregiver gave her lots of help.  But still, even with unlimited time the vast majority of people will not score that high, and it's unlikely that her assistant would be that smart, so how did that happen.  And, if you read her writings on the web, to the extent you can find them, they are quite articulate and sophisticated.  Most people can't write that well.  Is it likely that her caregiver would?  Were the writings edited to read so well?  Or, did she really write them.  In some of the writings ""she"" says that she now writes unassisted.  I'd like to see that in the movie. Similarly she does seem to respond with comprehension to what people say to her, and she seems to give appropriate, if hard to understand verbal responses.  Maybe she is for real. I'd like to see the proof.In the end I really don't know.  This movie disappoints me for pretending the reasons for skeptiscism don't even exist. Because the movie begs the real questions so thoroughly I find it highly suspect.  I'd love to see the evidence that this story is real and not a well-meaning hoax.  Until then I don't believe it.",2,Propaganda - Unanswered Questions are Disturbing,1117929600,"06 5, 2005",2005,4192,"['saw', 'movie', 'TV', 'week', 'ago', 'troubled', 'deeply', 'Purportedly', 'was', 'written', 'autistic', 'woman', 'named', 'Sue', 'Rubin', 'story', 'heartwarming', 'story', 'woman', 'locked', 'prison', 'autism', 'was', 'rescued', 'assisted', 'communication', 'still', 'retarded', 'autistic', 'uncommunicative', 'person', 'being', 'manipulated', 'family', 'academic', 'supporters', 'assisted', 'communications', 'appear', 'genius', 'sort', 'autistic', 'Helen', 'Keller.It', 'disturbed', 'did', 'quite', 'bit', 'research', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'am', 'left', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'piece', 'propaganda', 'highly', 'controversial', 'view', 'autism', 'very', 'one-sided', 'story', 'end', 'find', 'unconvinced', 'concerned', 'parents', 'autistic', 'children', 'are', 'being', 'misled', 'am', 'giving', 'movie', 'two', 'rather', 'one', 'star', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'well', 'am', 'only', 'giving', 'two', 'stars', 'so', 'misleading', 'certainly', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'questions', 'unanswered.On', 'surface', 'story', 'Sue', 'Rubin', '26', 'year', 'old', 'college', 'student', 'Whittier', 'college', 'Sue', 'Rubin', 'retarded', 'as', 'well', 'autistic', 'was', '13', 'was', 'considered', 'have', 'mental', 'age', 'three', 'Then', 'aid', 'something', 'called', 'assisted', 'communication', 'aid', 'holding', 'hand', 'keyboard', 'gradually', 'blossomed', 'someone', 'IQ', '130', 'still', 'autistic', 'still', 'severely', 'handicapped', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'perform', 'basic', 'functions', 'can', 'read', 'write', 'learn', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'college.Now', 'first', 'mention', 'assisted', 'communication', 'movie', 'controversial', 'assisted', 'communication', 'never', 'never', 'just', 'there.Controversial', 'Here', 'where', 'was', 'driven', 'do', 'research', 'community', 'people', 'who', 'work', 'autistics', 'are', 'seriously', 'split', 'issue', 'Many', 'experiments', 'demonstrate', 'assisted', 'communication', 'case', 'autistics', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'one', 'critic', 'said', 'using', 'autistic', 'people', 'ouija', 'board', 'doubt', 'assisted', 'communication', 'real', 'respect', 'handicapped', 'people', 'such', 'suffering', 'cerebral', 'palsy', 'serious', 'doubt', 'effective', 'autistics.So', 'here', 'where', 'movie', 'really', 'troubled', 'Sue', 'Rubin', 'real', 'progress', 'illusion', 'combination', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'family', 'overzealous', 'advocacy', 'academics', 'axe', 'grind', 'movie', 'never', 'question', 'let', 'alone', 'answers', 'real', 'Yet', 'just', ""n't"", 'possible', 'tell', 'movie', 'Did', 'Sue', 'Rubin', 'really', 'write', 'Did', 'well-meaning', 'care', 'giver', 'had', 'write', 'really', 'Sue', 'Rubin', 'communicating', 'care-givers', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'read', 'web.On', 'one', 'hand', 'Sue', 'Rubin', 'supposedly', 'tested', '1300', 'SAT', ""'m"", 'sure', 'had', 'unlimited', 'time', ""'m"", 'sure', 'caregiver', 'gave', 'lots', 'help', 'still', 'even', 'unlimited', 'time', 'vast', 'majority', 'people', 'will', 'not', 'score', 'high', 'unlikely', 'assistant', 'would', 'be', 'smart', 'how', 'did', 'happen', 'read', 'writings', 'web', 'extent', 'can', 'find', 'are', 'quite', 'articulate', 'sophisticated', 'Most', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'write', 'well', 'likely', 'caregiver', 'would', 'Were', 'writings', 'edited', 'read', 'so', 'well', 'did', 'really', 'write', 'writings', 'now', 'unassisted', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'movie', 'Similarly', 'seem', 'respond', 'comprehension', 'what', 'people', 'say', 'give', 'appropriate', 'hard', 'understand', 'verbal', 'responses', 'Maybe', 'real', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'proof.In', 'end', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'pretending', 'reasons', 'skeptiscism', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'exist', 'movie', 'real', 'questions', 'thoroughly', 'find', 'highly', 'suspect', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'evidence', 'story', 'real', 'not', 'well-meaning', 'hoax', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe']",Autism is a World - CNN

During childhood, Sue was also diagnosed with mental retardation and assessed to be functioning at about the 3 year old level.  Her parents and therapists subsequently began to use Facilitated Communication with Sue.  Facilitated Communication is a controversial technique in which a 'facilitator' holds the arm of a person with autistic disorder while she/he types on a keyboard.  In Sue's case, one of her therapists holds the keyboard while Sue types.  Sue's verbal skills are limited (she says `later' quite a bit), so the words that are produced via her Facilitated Communication are narrated by Julianne Marguiles.Unfortunately, Facilitated Communication has been the source of great controversy and simply has not stood up to scientific examination; in fact, an official resolution has been adopted by the American Psychological Association (APA).""THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that APA adopts the position that facilitated communication is a controversial and unproved communicative procedure with no scientifically demonstrated support for its efficacy""  (This information is provided at the APA website - search for ""Council Policy Manual: M. Scientific Affairs"").Sue's story is certainly interesting, as she has obviously made enough progress that she's able to live on her own with assistance and even attend college.  She also seems to have amazing parents who love her.  However, it would be misleading to assume that she is typing all of the material in the program that is attributed to her.  Not once was Sue shown typing more than a few letters in a row by herself.  I'm concerned that the film may provide false hope to people whose loved ones may have autistic disorder, particularly given that the documentary does not present the other side of this controversy.
