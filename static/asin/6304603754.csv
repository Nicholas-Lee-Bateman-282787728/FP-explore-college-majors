429357,A9V06G9SIID08,6304603754,Dafydd Mac an Leigh,"[21, 26]","This movie is an utter disappointment. The concept it explores - budding female sexuality in a hyper-testoterone environment - is certainly fascinating and well worth exploring, but the realization of that concept falls apart in nearly every way. The script is very badly written, both in terms of storyline, and of dialogue. One can't help feeling, for example, that the screenwriter wrote swearwords into the opening monologue simply to have the speaker swear. The story relies so heavily on cliche that you can predict each plot twist twenty minutes in advance. The army base, where most of the film takes place, is in a state of disrepair that the army would never have allowed - the set dressers couldn't even get rid of the cobwebs. The supporting actors are laughably bad, from the &quot;lone biker&quot; guy who deflowers one sister, to the &quot;sympathetic officer&quot; who teaches the other to shoot a gun, to the various soldiers and cadets milling about the outskirts of the plot. In fact, this movie is so bad over all, it might be enjoyable to watch simply to make fun of it. Except no, the two starring actresses, Daisy Eagan and Monica Keena, are far to good. (Eagan is best known for playing Mary Lennox in &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; on Broadway, for which she won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical - at age 11.) I wanted &quot;Ripe&quot; to be good. I really did.

If there wasn't a synopsis attached with this DVD, with just the cover alone I would not expect for Ron Brice to be apart of this movie. Ron Brice (Ken) was my rationale for buying this movie! I like how Ken took Rosie under his wing & treated her as if she was his' daughter or neice. I can say thanks to the director for not having Ken & Rosie engage in sexual activity! I was pleased with Ron Brice's, Daisy's and Monica's characters, except for a few things... I couldn't fathom why Violet decided to hide her menstruation from Rosie being that they were so close? Being that all they had were each other Violet should've confided in Rosie. Then when she flushed her panties down the toilet I wanted to slap her, if she had washed it & put it aside then that would've made sense! I was curious to know which 1 was the oldest of the 2? I totally was disturb when Rosie smashed the 2 rats (un-called for). Another part in the movie that I didn't overstand is at the beginning when they played hide & seek with their father, was he playing with them or intoxicated?.. The mother said that she's calling the cops so it wasn't clear if he was playing or just abusive! Maybe he wasn't playing with a full deck, because I can't fathom why he would hold a rifle to little kids like he did! The seargeant's wife Mrs. Hyman was an old red-neck freak! She's promiscuous how dare she commit adultry & she has a little daughter! I loved Rosie's aggressiveness until she killed Pete... Pete invited them into his home & Rosie added insult to injury by killing him! I guess she felt that was the only way to seperate Pete & Violet? (it was wrong) Pete should've told Violet & Rosie about the money he'd received being that they were the reason that he made it!By keeping it locked in his draw it made him look sneaky! With the exception of Ken (Brice) those guy's behaved like ignorant school boys filled with Hormones. Ken comes to Rosie's rescue when she gets drunk & Jimmy (Vincent) tries to take advantage of her. That's why 1 of the reasons why I'm in love with Bricebecause his' roles are always hard-ass tough-guy(s)!!!! I wished that Rosie & Violet would have converse more than they did, then maybe their relationship would not have ended like it did? Violet was a snake for leaving Rosie with out telling her 1st! Violet took the bullets out of the chamber so that Rosie wouldn't commit suicide, but Rosie has access to get more ammunition (so that was redundant)!!!!Regardless I would recommend this movie to someone with similar taste!",4,A Story of Sister-hood also how Strong-Bonds can be Broken!,1116892800,"05 24, 2005",2005,2627,"['Ripe', 'prime', 'example', 'why', 'best', 'not', 'judge', 'book', 'person', 'exterior', 'was', ""n't"", 'synopsis', 'attached', 'DVD', 'just', 'cover', 'alone', 'would', 'not', 'expect', 'Ron', 'Brice', 'be', 'apart', 'movie', 'Ron', 'Brice', 'Ken', 'was', 'rationale', 'buying', 'movie', 'how', 'Ken', 'took', 'Rosie', 'wing', 'treated', 'was', 'daughter', 'neice', 'can', 'say', 'thanks', 'director', 'not', 'having', 'Ken', 'Rosie', 'engage', 'sexual', 'activity', 'was', 'pleased', 'Ron', 'Brice', 'Daisy', 'Monica', 'characters', 'few', 'things', 'could', ""n't"", 'fathom', 'why', 'Violet', 'decided', 'hide', 'menstruation', 'Rosie', 'being', 'were', 'so', 'close', 'Being', 'had', 'were', 'other', 'Violet', 'should', ""'ve"", 'confided', 'Rosie', 'Then', 'when', 'flushed', 'panties', 'down', 'toilet', 'wanted', 'slap', 'had', 'washed', 'put', 'aside', 'then', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'sense', 'was', 'curious', 'know', '1', 'was', 'oldest', '2', 'totally', 'was', 'disturb', 'when', 'Rosie', 'smashed', '2', 'rats', 'un-called', 'part', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'overstand', 'beginning', 'when', 'played', 'hide', 'seek', 'father', 'was', 'playing', 'intoxicated', 'mother', 'said', 'calling', 'cops', 'was', ""n't"", 'clear', 'was', 'playing', 'just', 'abusive', 'Maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'playing', 'full', 'deck', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fathom', 'why', 'would', 'hold', 'rifle', 'little', 'kids', 'did', 'seargeant', 'wife', 'Mrs.', 'Hyman', 'was', 'old', 'red-neck', 'freak', 'promiscuous', 'how', 'dare', 'commit', 'adultry', 'little', 'daughter', 'loved', 'Rosie', 'aggressiveness', 'killed', 'Pete', 'Pete', 'invited', 'home', 'Rosie', 'added', 'insult', 'injury', 'killing', 'guess', 'felt', 'was', 'only', 'way', 'seperate', 'Pete', 'Violet', 'was', 'wrong', 'Pete', 'should', ""'ve"", 'told', 'Violet', 'Rosie', 'money', ""'d"", 'received', 'being', 'were', 'reason', 'made', 'keeping', 'locked', 'draw', 'made', 'look', 'sneaky', 'exception', 'Ken', 'Brice', 'guy', 'behaved', 'ignorant', 'school', 'boys', 'filled', 'Hormones', 'Ken', 'Rosie', 'rescue', 'when', 'drunk', 'Jimmy', 'Vincent', 'take', 'advantage', 'why', '1', 'reasons', 'why', ""'m"", 'love', 'Bricebecause', 'roles', 'are', 'always', 'hard-ass', 'tough-guy', 'wished', 'Rosie', 'Violet', 'would', 'have', 'converse', 'more', 'did', 'then', 'maybe', 'relationship', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'ended', 'did', 'Violet', 'was', 'snake', 'leaving', 'Rosie', 'out', 'telling', '1st', 'Violet', 'took', 'bullets', 'chamber', 'Rosie', 'would', ""n't"", 'commit', 'suicide', 'Rosie', 'access', 'get', 'more', 'ammunition', 'was', 'redundant', 'Regardless', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'someone', 'similar', 'taste']",Ripe VHS

As for the rest of the film, I'm not to keen on militairy stuff, and the other sister was so...well, the type of girl I really can't stand. I rather wished this movie would have had a happy ending, with the biker dude and Keena running off together and getting married, leaving the sister to enjoy her continued gender bending existence.

Of course, as I'm sure was the case with others who rented this movie, the cover was what attracted me to it.  I am a heterosexual female, so it wasn't necessarily the sex appeal, but more so that title of the movie and the simplicity of the cover.  After reading the back of the box, I decided to check it out.  For some, perhaps most, this movie will be a let down.  You'd probably be expecting a sexually driven/teenage hormones extravaganza, but in the end, this movie is really the deep story of a very tough choice.  It's a look into the life of two teenage sisters, Rosie and Violet, on the run from the death of both of their parents.  Throughout the movie, I was constantly rolling my eyes and sighing from annoyance towards Rosie, the apathetic tomboy of the two.  Violet, sometimes seemingly naive and ignorant, had her share of sighs as well.  However, about 2/3 into the movie, my attitude towards all of this changed, as the storyline dramatically did as well.  The last twenty minutes were a real shock (some reviews said that this movie was very cliche, very unoriginal, and very predictable, but I disagree), and made the rest of the movie worth it.  I loved the ending -- just sad enough to make an impact.. had it ended any other way, I probably wouldn't be as satisfied with this movie.  All in all, Ripe is worth a shot if you have some time to burn and an open mind (not tarnished from these bad reviews).",3,A lot of flack.. an average (NOT BAD) movie.,1031788800,"09 12, 2002",2002,1478,"['Ripe', 'is..', 'interesting', 'movie', 'say', 'least', 'course', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'case', 'others', 'who', 'rented', 'movie', 'cover', 'was', 'what', 'attracted', 'am', 'heterosexual', 'female', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'sex', 'appeal', 'more', 'so', 'title', 'movie', 'simplicity', 'cover', 'reading', 'back', 'box', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'perhaps', 'most', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'let', 'down', ""'d"", 'probably', 'be', 'expecting', 'sexually', 'driven/teenage', 'hormones', 'extravaganza', 'end', 'movie', 'really', 'deep', 'story', 'very', 'tough', 'choice', 'look', 'life', 'two', 'teenage', 'sisters', 'Rosie', 'Violet', 'run', 'death', 'parents', 'movie', 'was', 'constantly', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'sighing', 'annoyance', 'towards', 'Rosie', 'apathetic', 'tomboy', 'two', 'Violet', 'sometimes', 'seemingly', 'naive', 'ignorant', 'had', 'share', 'sighs', 'well', 'However', 'about', '2/3', 'movie', 'attitude', 'changed', 'storyline', 'dramatically', 'did', 'as', 'well', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'were', 'real', 'shock', 'reviews', 'said', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'cliche', 'very', 'unoriginal', 'very', 'predictable', 'disagree', 'made', 'rest', 'movie', 'loved', 'ending', 'just', 'sad', 'enough', 'make', 'impact..', 'had', 'ended', 'other', 'way', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'satisfied', 'movie', 'Ripe', 'shot', 'have', 'time', 'burn', 'open', 'mind', 'not', 'tarnished', 'bad', 'reviews']",Ripe VHS

Keegan and Eagan play sisters Violet, the beautiful, sexually curious younger sister (Keegan) and Rosie, the tomboy, gun-lovin' tough girl sister (Eagan).The movie starts out with the girls being around 6 or 8 with a really violent homelife and parents that are abusive towards one another and towards the girls.  Car accident ensues and Rosie drags her sister from the burning car.  They VOW to be together FOREVER!However... Violet's vow is broken as she becomes interested in sex and a long haired drifter with a motorcycle.  Rosie's vow was a real one & she gets emotionally crushed by her own sister.  The only person that she ever loved.This movie is a great coming of age story with a wicked, surprise ending.  No real nudity to speak of, very little bad language, some brief sexual situations.

Ripe is NOT the perverted, exploitative testosterone-fest that its totally misleading cover suggests. Rather, it is a coming-of-age tale that explores a troubling IDEA in a challenging and fairly chaste manner. Sorry guys -- NO nudity, NO crude sneak-a-peek sex scenes. Rough language and some suggestive situations, yes -- but these are consistent with the concept director Mo Ogrodnik is trying to explore.Clearly, this film was shot on a very low budget; and clearly, the script and setup skimp on (or totally overlook) several key details that would have certainly rounded out the characters and their story. For instance, there's NO way Pete's ""these are my nieces"" cover would have held water for more than three minutes, given the way the military dance thread unfolds. Also, while Violet is an extremely attractive teenage girl, Pete is also an outrageously buff and handsome guy who could probably have his choice of beautiful women. The movie can't seem to decide if it wants the viewer to perceive his character as an opportunistic creep; or as an introverted, lonely, misunderstood misfit seeking connection. An extremely icky vacuum scene with a dilapidated Karen Lynn Gorney from ""Saturday Night Fever"" (who desperately needs to find a new agent, and/or a new career) suggests the former; Pete's treatment by the soldiers implies the latter.Many of the film's visuals are not only framed well but actually quite striking, and Anton Sanko's score is exceptional. Ultimately, Ripe explores some disturbing themes in a very poignant way, with a tone that darkens down to midnight black at the end.
