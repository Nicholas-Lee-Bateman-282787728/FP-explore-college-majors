Khan is stronger, more intelligent, and more charismatic than a typical human, but he is also more ambitious and egotistical.The scenes where he seduces and later manipulates the historian, Lt. Givens, are unforgettable and chilling. His first scene with Dr. McCoy and the banquet are also top-notch, and very effective.The story begins a little slowly, but as soon as Khan awakens, the episode becomes very engrossing, completely swallowing the viewer into the very well-written story.One of the very best Star Trek episode in the series.

207810,A1F7U2TQHO3A8J,6300213285,Brian Overland,"[0, 0]","This episode has become such a classic that I can't withhold the 5-star rating. In the end, it earns its rating because of the well-matched, carefully balanced antagonism between the two main opponents, Khan (the irreplaceable Ricardo Montalban) and Kirk (Shatner, of course). This is a showdown between a genetically-enabled Might Makes Right philosophy and the democratic ideals of the Scientific Enlightenment. Best of all is the fact that the ""bad guy"" is not superficial or one-dimensional. He says things like ""We offered the world order"" and ""Join me. I will treat you well."" He is not easily defeated by any means.From the moment he is picked up by the Enterprise, Khan schemes to take over the ship. Born as a result of 20th-century experiments in genetics, Khan is physically and mentally superior. He believes that he can easily master the technical advances of the 23rd century and defeat Kirk. To some extent, he is right.What do Kirk, Spock, and company have on their side? Nothing much, except their humanity. Khan, for all his superiority, represents a kind of Nietzschean ""Superman"" ideal that (in the view of Kirk and Spock) should have died with Hitler. Humanity wins out. To gain control of the ship, Khan seduces a pretty Enterprise officer (Madlyn Rhue), but his shocking brutality turns her against him in the end. Although the philosopher Nietzsche is never mentioned by name, the term ""Superman"" is frequently used in Nietzsche's sense of the word.The episode is most famous, of course, for setting up Star Trek II. (Caveat: don't look for Chekov in this TV episode. You won't find him.) In that film, they defeat him again, but not without cost, which is appropriate. Kirk alone couldn't twice defeat Khan. Only with the help of Spock could he do so. It is interesting that Spock is something of a Superman himself, but his Buddhist-like Vulcan philsophy rejects the Will to Power of which Khan is the embodiment.Two things to look for: 1) The hand-to-hand fight between Kirk and Khan is unintentionally hilarious, because if you watch carefully it's obvious these are two stuntment who look nothing like the actors. 2) On the plus side, the Milton quote at the end is smart, almost highbrow. The quote is not even explained until Scotty asks later, so that those who have an English degree can congratulate themselves on being ahead of the rest of the TV audience.",5,Nietzsche's Superman... and Rich Corinthian Leather!,1188432000,"08 30, 2007",2007,2391,"['episode', 'become', 'classic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'withhold', '5-star', 'rating', 'end', 'rating', 'well-matched', 'carefully', 'balanced', 'antagonism', 'two', 'main', 'opponents', 'Khan', 'irreplaceable', 'Ricardo', 'Montalban', 'Kirk', 'Shatner', 'course', 'showdown', 'genetically-enabled', 'Might', 'Makes', 'Right', 'philosophy', 'democratic', 'ideals', 'Scientific', 'Enlightenment', 'Best', 'fact', 'bad', 'guy', 'not', 'superficial', 'one-dimensional', 'things', 'offered', 'world', 'order', 'Join', 'will', 'treat', 'well', 'not', 'easily', 'defeated', 'means.From', 'moment', 'picked', 'up', 'Enterprise', 'Khan', 'take', 'over', 'ship', 'Born', 'result', '20th-century', 'experiments', 'genetics', 'Khan', 'physically', 'mentally', 'superior', 'can', 'easily', 'master', 'technical', 'advances', '23rd', 'century', 'defeat', 'Kirk', 'extent', 'right.What', 'do', 'Kirk', 'Spock', 'company', 'have', 'side', 'Nothing', 'much', 'humanity', 'Khan', 'superiority', 'kind', 'Nietzschean', 'Superman', 'ideal', 'view', 'Kirk', 'Spock', 'should', 'have', 'died', 'Hitler', 'Humanity', 'out', 'gain', 'control', 'ship', 'Khan', 'pretty', 'Enterprise', 'officer', 'Madlyn', 'Rhue', 'shocking', 'brutality', 'end', 'philosopher', 'Nietzsche', 'never', 'mentioned', 'name', 'term', 'Superman', 'frequently', 'used', 'Nietzsche', 'sense', 'word.The', 'episode', 'most', 'famous', 'course', 'setting', 'up', 'Star', 'Trek', 'II', 'Caveat', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'Chekov', 'TV', 'episode', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'film', 'defeat', 'again', 'not', 'cost', 'appropriate', 'Kirk', 'alone', 'could', ""n't"", 'twice', 'defeat', 'Khan', 'Only', 'help', 'Spock', 'could', 'do', 'so', 'interesting', 'Spock', 'something', 'Superman', 'Buddhist-like', 'Vulcan', 'philsophy', 'Will', 'Power', 'Khan', 'embodiment.Two', 'things', 'look', '1', 'hand-to-hand', 'fight', 'Kirk', 'Khan', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious', 'watch', 'carefully', 'obvious', 'are', 'two', 'stuntment', 'who', 'look', 'nothing', 'actors', '2', 'plus', 'side', 'Milton', 'quote', 'end', 'smart', 'almost', 'highbrow', 'quote', 'not', 'even', 'explained', 'Scotty', 'later', 'who', 'have', 'English', 'degree', 'can', 'congratulate', 'being', 'ahead', 'rest', 'TV', 'audience']",N/A

I consider Ricardo Montalban to have been the best guest star to appear in the original series and in the sequence of movies extending the series. The Enterprise encounters an old Earth ship slowly making its' way through the stars. They board it and discover that it is a sleeper ship containing a group of people who left Earth in the late twentieth century. The leader of the group spontaneously awakens and is brought on board the Enterprise.They discover that he is a human genetically engineered to have superior strength and mental ability. Eventually, they learn that he is Khan Singh, who was the absolute ruler of a large segment of Earth several centuries ago, when all leaders were genetically engineered tyrants. With the help of a traitorous female member of the Enterprise, Khan is able to get back to his sleeper ship, revive his comrades and take over the Enterprise. However, the female crewmember betrays Khan, rescuing Kirk and giving the Enterprise crew an opportunity to regain control of the ship. In one of the best endings in the original series, Kirk convenes a tribunal and gives Khan a choice. He and his group can either face charges or be marooned on a planet with a harsh climate. Khan's response is to refer to Milton, which Kirk immediately understands. Scotty then asks Kirk for the reference, which is ""It is better to rule in hell than to serve in heaven.""Montalban is superb as Khan, arrogant yet compelling. He yields nothing to the crew of the Enterprise, having lost none of his confidence, despite being several centuries out of date.  His personal power is clear, and his willingness to die rather than be defeated is consistent with his statement, ""I have never been afraid.""

The Enterprise discovers Khan and dozens of his followers in suspended animation when they find the Botany Bay adrift in space.  The charismatic Khan seduces Marla McGivers (who may well be the only ship's historian ever seen on a starship) and with her help revives his crew, who immediately take over the Enterprise.  You would think these people who be daunted by 200 years of scientific and technological advances, but Kirk lends a helping hand by giving Khan all the technical manuals he would need.  Montalban's performance is what makes &quot;Space Speed&quot; a standout episode, proving that there is not much more impressive in the world than good diction and a neat accent.  He might be having his biggest battles in this episode with Kirk, but the scene where Khan threatens McCoy provide one of the good doctor's finest moments.
