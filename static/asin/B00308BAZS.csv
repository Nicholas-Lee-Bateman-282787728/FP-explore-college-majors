1314871,A1ZAIEZHFLI9UN,B00308BAZS,Benjamin Archambault,"[7, 8]","This 6-episode disc is filled with the intense action of a good movie. Spec Ops man Wil Willis (Whiskey Whiskey) is given a mission against 4 opposing enemies. During the course of his mission, there's almost always something the changes the game -- like a hostage being taken or intel discovering WMDs on site that need to be destroyed.Each episode is really a military training exercise conducted by very experienced and able soldiers. But as you're given insight into how Wil Willis operates, you'll quickly discover that the four soldiers are a few men short of a fair fight.You'll learn how the ""instincts"" inscribed during training can save a Spec Ops man. And you'll learn that there's no magic to their operation. They move in and out like ghosts to the enemy. But to the operator, they slowly belly crawl through thick brush in order to hit and run without being seen.If you enjoy military special operations, you'll love this show.",5,Exciting and Educational Show,1287619200,"10 21, 2010",2010,941,"['6-episode', 'disc', 'filled', 'intense', 'action', 'good', 'movie', 'Spec', 'Ops', 'man', 'Wil', 'Willis', 'Whiskey', 'Whiskey', 'given', 'mission', '4', 'opposing', 'enemies', 'course', 'mission', 'almost', 'always', 'something', 'changes', 'game', 'hostage', 'being', 'taken', 'intel', 'discovering', 'WMDs', 'site', 'need', 'be', 'destroyed.Each', 'episode', 'really', 'military', 'training', 'exercise', 'conducted', 'very', 'experienced', 'able', 'soldiers', ""'re"", 'given', 'insight', 'how', 'Wil', 'Willis', ""'ll"", 'quickly', 'discover', 'four', 'soldiers', 'are', 'few', 'men', 'short', 'fair', 'fight.You', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'how', 'instincts', 'inscribed', 'training', 'can', 'save', 'Spec', 'Ops', 'man', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'magic', 'operation', 'move', 'like', 'ghosts', 'enemy', 'operator', 'slowly', 'belly', 'crawl', 'thick', 'brush', 'order', 'hit', 'run', 'being', 'seen.If', 'enjoy', 'military', 'special', 'operations', ""'ll"", 'love', 'show']",N/A

1314874,A1U0QSDR7T41XQ,B00308BAZS,Michael G,"[16, 16]","as a current military member i loved this show. i first saw reruns on the military channel and had to buy the season.premise: Will Wilis is a former ranger/para rescue operator. if you are not military that means he was a bad ass and worked with the Special Forces. this one guy carrys out realalistic war games to show viewers how military operations work. Will normally goes up against 4 to 6 enemy opp for (opposition force) the opp for concists of former military and law enforcement personnel. for the most part they are great at their job, but Will is better. they carry out what is called a war game. war games are simulated missions where each side has an objective and they try to carry out thier mission. example there is one where will has to shoot a drug lord and the opp for has to protect the drug lord.too make it more realalistic durring every mission, mission control puts in a little twist to make if differnet then what was originally organized. this gives it a realalistic feel to how combat missions normally end up, unpredictable. keeping with the realness all participants use what are called sim rounds (simunition rounds) what these are are plastic bullets filled with dish soap. when they hit a target they hurt but do not kill and leave a visible paint mark on a person. they can be fired from a normal weapon so it is very realalistic.overall this show is fun and is worth the price for only 6 episodes. if you dont believe me they show it all the time on the military channel, normally at night. find it watch it once and you will want to watch the rest of them.",5,about as realalistic as it can get.,1283299200,"09 1, 2010",2010,1591,"['current', 'military', 'member', 'i', 'loved', 'show', 'i', 'first', 'saw', 'reruns', 'military', 'channel', 'had', 'buy', 'season.premise', 'Will', 'Wilis', 'former', 'ranger/para', 'rescue', 'operator', 'are', 'not', 'military', 'was', 'bad', 'ass', 'worked', 'Special', 'Forces', 'one', 'guy', 'out', 'realalistic', 'war', 'games', 'show', 'viewers', 'how', 'military', 'operations', 'work', 'Will', 'normally', 'up', '4', '6', 'enemy', 'opp', 'opposition', 'force', 'opp', 'concists', 'former', 'military', 'law', 'enforcement', 'personnel', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'great', 'job', 'Will', 'better', 'carry', 'out', 'what', 'called', 'war', 'game', 'war', 'games', 'are', 'simulated', 'missions', 'where', 'side', 'objective', 'try', 'carry', 'out', 'thier', 'mission', 'example', 'one', 'where', 'will', 'shoot', 'drug', 'lord', 'opp', 'protect', 'drug', 'lord.too', 'make', 'more', 'realalistic', 'durring', 'mission', 'mission', 'control', 'little', 'twist', 'make', 'differnet', 'then', 'what', 'was', 'originally', 'organized', 'realalistic', 'feel', 'how', 'combat', 'missions', 'normally', 'end', 'up', 'unpredictable', 'keeping', 'realness', 'participants', 'use', 'what', 'are', 'called', 'sim', 'rounds', 'simunition', 'what', 'are', 'are', 'plastic', 'bullets', 'filled', 'dish', 'soap', 'when', 'hit', 'target', 'hurt', 'do', 'not', 'kill', 'leave', 'visible', 'paint', 'mark', 'person', 'can', 'be', 'fired', 'normal', 'weapon', 'very', 'realalistic.overall', 'show', 'fun', 'price', 'only', '6', 'episodes', 'dont', 'believe', 'show', 'time', 'military', 'channel', 'normally', 'night', 'find', 'watch', 'once', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'rest']",N/A

Being as I am into survival shows and military shows, I was really looking forward to watching and liking this show. What really distracted me from being entirely sucked in to loving this show is the fact that there are cameramen shooting the action. This really detracts from the realism of the missions for me. The whole time I'm thinking, ""how does the ""enemy"" not only NOT see the host, but also somehow NOT see the cameramen?"" If they DID see the camera guys, they could easily see which direction the camera is pointing and easily find out where the host of the show is. It REALLY irritated me and detracted from my overall enjoyment of the show. Knowing that the camera guys are out there and most likely NOT all camoflaged up and hiding really spoiled the suspense. It just made it seem staged to me.Perhaps though, you will find this show enjoyable. For seven bucks, maybe to you it's worth checking out. Check out the other well written reviews. It does have very good adivce for certain survial and combat situations. One of the other two shows I actually bought was ""Surviving the Cut"" from Discovery Channel. I REALLY enjoyed that show, however.
