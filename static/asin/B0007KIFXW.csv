881613,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B0007KIFXW,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[7, 8]","In the second volume of the Viva La Bam DVDs, we are treated to not one but two seasons of the series, sixteen complete episodes of hilarity. Bam, like always, is the goofball in charge of the bunch of friends he calls the CKY crew, and together they torture Bam's parents, Phil and April, as well as his uncle Don Vito, a blob of a man who just doesn't know how to pronounce words when angry.Here's a list of the top four episodes in each series:Season 2:Episode 1: Castle Bam: After getting kicked out of his house in the last season, Bam, family, and friends movie into a new place.Episode 4: Mardi Gras Part 1: The start of Bam's adventure to Mardi Gras begins with abandoning Dunn at home.Episode 5: Mardi Gras Part 2: The conclusion of Bam's journey to Mardi Gras, where he finds Ryan Dunn waiting for him.Episode 6: Community Disservice: Bam challenges April to do five good things, which he promises to do himself: his way, of course.Season 3:Episode 5: Mutiny on the Bam: Bam and his wary parents go on a cruise, where Vito is the brunt of the jokes.Episode 6: Angry Ape: April is no longer allowed to complain, at least for 24 hours, but can she do it with Bam as her son?Episode 7: Mall of Bam: Bam and family lock themselves inside the Mall of America while Vito goes crazy in an attempt to kill Bam.Episode 8: Bamiature Golf: After destroying Vito's car again, Bam builds a miniature golf course and challenges Vito to a game.Like in the first volume, though, the best of what this collection contains is in the special features disc. With the deleted scenes and Random-A** moments, all of the hilarity of the episodes are bottled into a bunch of quick scenes. What's found here is better than what can be found in the series.Viva La Bam continues to get better, especially with Vito as the new target of Bam. Now, with three seasons under his belt, Bam's show has already matched Jackass's success and still continues. This a great series guaranteed to bring about laughs.",5,Two Times the Fun of the First,1137542400,"01 18, 2006",2006,1986,"['second', 'volume', 'Viva', 'La', 'Bam', 'DVDs', 'are', 'treated', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'seasons', 'series', 'sixteen', 'complete', 'episodes', 'hilarity', 'Bam', 'always', 'goofball', 'charge', 'bunch', 'friends', 'CKY', 'crew', 'together', 'torture', 'Bam', 'parents', 'Phil', 'April', 'as', 'well', 'uncle', 'Don', 'Vito', 'blob', 'man', 'who', 'just', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'pronounce', 'words', 'when', 'list', 'top', 'four', 'episodes', 'series', 'Season', '2', 'Episode', '1', 'Castle', 'Bam', 'getting', 'kicked', 'house', 'last', 'season', 'Bam', 'family', 'movie', 'new', 'place.Episode', '4', 'Mardi', 'Gras', 'Part', '1', 'start', 'Bam', 'adventure', 'Mardi', 'Gras', 'abandoning', 'Dunn', 'home.Episode', '5', 'Mardi', 'Gras', 'Part', '2', 'conclusion', 'Bam', 'journey', 'Mardi', 'Gras', 'where', 'Ryan', 'Dunn', 'waiting', 'him.Episode', '6', 'Community', 'Disservice', 'Bam', 'April', 'do', 'five', 'good', 'things', 'do', 'way', 'course.Season', '3', 'Episode', '5', 'Mutiny', 'Bam', 'Bam', 'wary', 'parents', 'go', 'cruise', 'where', 'Vito', 'brunt', 'jokes.Episode', '6', 'Angry', 'Ape', 'April', 'no', 'longer', 'allowed', 'complain', 'least', '24', 'hours', 'can', 'do', 'Bam', 'son', 'Episode', '7', 'Mall', 'Bam', 'Bam', 'family', 'lock', 'Mall', 'America', 'Vito', 'crazy', 'attempt', 'kill', 'Bam.Episode', '8', 'Bamiature', 'Golf', 'destroying', 'Vito', 'car', 'again', 'Bam', 'miniature', 'golf', 'course', 'Vito', 'game.Like', 'first', 'volume', 'though', 'best', 'what', 'collection', 'special', 'features', 'disc', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Random-A**', 'moments', 'hilarity', 'episodes', 'are', 'bottled', 'bunch', 'quick', 'scenes', 'What', 'found', 'here', 'better', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'series.Viva', 'La', 'Bam', 'get', 'better', 'especially', 'Vito', 'new', 'target', 'Bam', 'Now', 'three', 'seasons', 'belt', 'Bam', 'show', 'already', 'matched', 'Jackass', 'success', 'still', 'great', 'series', 'guaranteed', 'bring', 'about', 'laughs']",N/A

In one of the best episodes of this set, Johnny Knoxville really dishes it out to Bam, and really puts him in his place, which is nice to see.

881625,A3TT8HCUUH2AZW,B0007KIFXW,KKRM0,"[1, 3]",First of all reviewers say that this is a must own DVD for any Viva La Bam fan.  I went to the network website (which all of you should know is MTV) to buy season one when I was a big fan at the time.  I enjoyed it and also enjoyed it with the commentarry.  I then bought seasons 2 and 3 at the same place and later also bought the second season of Punk'd.  I enjoyed the other two seasons as well but before I bought season one it was told to me by my dad that I would only see it once and then it would be sitting on the shelves for a while.  I still went on and bought the show on DVD.  It was funny on MTV and it was funny on DVD.  One of my favorite episodes was the prank war with Johnny Knoxville that I would watch over and over again but sooner or later my dad predicted this moment that I would stop watching it and the DVD would end up sitting on the shelf with other DVD's.  Now I have lost intrest in watching Viva La Bam for a while.  But it never sits on the shelf sometimes because my brother loves to watch it.  So is it really worth buying an MTV show?  Is it?Is it staged?  Another intresting question about the show.  Bam doesn't care about much and enjoys destroying Don Vito's cars.  Of course every time this occurs he is mad.  Of course.  I don't really know anyone who spends thousands of dollars on a car and doesn't get mad when it is destroyed.  Except Bam.  Once Bam and the CKY crew wreck Vito's house Vito strikes back and steals Bam's H2 hummer.  Don Vito destroys it and Bam responds by saying I am proud of you.  But if you think about the situation a little bit but still.  Bam also wrecks his parents house and he doesn't care.  He ruins old furniture from the old house by burning it after moving it to the new house.  He doesn't care.  Bam makes his parents extremely crazy.  Phil seems to lazy to care but April just yells yet Bam doesn't listen.  Bam doesn't care.  But Bam has the talent to sure entertain the teens and others who love his show on MTV.Earns a well deserved three stars because it was good while it lasted.  But Bam should lighten up a little bit.  His actions carry on too far.  He is a decent person on Jackass (I wonder why) but on Viva La Bam he pushes the limits.  While reading the above paragraph please don't think that I get offended by his actions because I don't.  It is just the fact that Bam needs a little bit of therapy along with his family.  Don Vito is funny and I will give props to him.  The episodes included on the set are funny (but not extremely funny) but like I said it gets a well deserved three stars if not two and a half.

For all it's gross-out moments, there were moments of genuine class and originality.And I guess I know where they came from. On the one hand, we have Johnny Knoxville, who has moved on from Jackass to become a genuine star in Hollywood, going from mainstream success (Dukes of Hazzard) to critical acclaim (Grand Theft Parsons) in just a couple of years. A genuine talent, and someone to watch in the future.Then we have Bam Margera, who took his ""is cruel to his parents"" thing from Jackass and made an entire show out of it. And it quite simply the most crass, unfunny and utterly, utterly FAKE rubbish on television.It's maybe a pity Bam didn't have parents who were, I dunno, better actors than they are, because their ""outraged"" responses to his ha-ha-larious stunts wouldn't seem out of place at a Sunday school play. The mother is the worst offender, and while Bam's stupid tagalong friends laugh in all the right places, there is a genuine cruel streak and nasty side to Bam that makes the whole program have a very bitter after-taste. I'd like to see what would happen if one of the yahoo's DIDN'T laugh or go along with everything.Of course, this show isn't aimed at the likes of The Curmudgeon. It's aimed at the big-shorted dumbass kids who think Avril Lavigne RAWWWWKS and can't see another phony being stuffed down their easily pleased, ""Hey Kids, This Is COOL"" MTV propoganda-fed throats.A loathsome, spoilt man child abusing his stupid mother and morbidly obese father? You wonder why it doesn't work. Then you remember it's one-trick pony Bam Margera, a guy pushing 30 who still tries to act like he's 14. And that his mother and father are in on every single second of it. Another pitiful MTV product that you should steer well clear of.[...]",1,Absolute JUNK.,1134691200,"12 16, 2005",2005,1857,"['start', 'idiot-magnet', 'let', 'get', 'one', 'thing', 'straight', 'Jackass', 'was', 'GOOD', 'TV', 'show', 'gross-out', 'moments', 'were', 'moments', 'genuine', 'class', 'originality.And', 'guess', 'know', 'where', 'came', 'one', 'hand', 'have', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'who', 'moved', 'Jackass', 'become', 'genuine', 'star', 'Hollywood', 'going', 'mainstream', 'success', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'Grand', 'Theft', 'Parsons', 'just', 'couple', 'years', 'genuine', 'talent', 'someone', 'watch', 'future.Then', 'have', 'Bam', 'Margera', 'who', 'took', 'cruel', 'parents', 'thing', 'Jackass', 'made', 'entire', 'show', 'quite', 'simply', 'most', 'crass', 'unfunny', 'utterly', 'utterly', 'FAKE', 'rubbish', 'television.It', 'maybe', 'pity', 'Bam', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'parents', 'who', 'were', 'dunno', 'better', 'actors', 'are', 'outraged', 'responses', 'ha-ha-larious', 'stunts', 'would', ""n't"", 'seem', 'place', 'Sunday', 'school', 'play', 'mother', 'worst', 'offender', 'Bam', 'stupid', 'tagalong', 'friends', 'right', 'places', 'genuine', 'cruel', 'streak', 'nasty', 'side', 'Bam', 'whole', 'program', 'have', 'very', 'bitter', 'after-taste', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'one', 'yahoo', 'DID', ""N'T"", 'laugh', 'go', 'everything.Of', 'course', 'show', ""n't"", 'aimed', 'likes', 'Curmudgeon', 'aimed', 'big-shorted', 'dumbass', 'kids', 'who', 'think', 'Avril', 'Lavigne', 'RAWWWWKS', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'phony', 'being', 'stuffed', 'down', 'easily', 'pleased', 'Hey', 'Kids', 'COOL', 'MTV', 'propoganda-fed', 'throats.A', 'loathsome', 'spoilt', 'man', 'child', 'abusing', 'stupid', 'mother', 'morbidly', 'obese', 'father', 'wonder', 'why', ""n't"", 'work', 'Then', 'remember', 'one-trick', 'pony', 'Bam', 'Margera', 'guy', 'pushing', '30', 'who', 'still', 'act', '14', 'mother', 'father', 'are', 'single', 'second', 'pitiful', 'MTV', 'product', 'should', 'steer', 'well', 'clear', 'of.', '[', ']']",N/A

881631,A1A2SWJHNJ10FP,B0007KIFXW,"Troy Kearney ""avid reader""","[3, 3]","Brandon Margera, better known to all of us as ""Bam"", is one guy that could be considered the ultimate problem child, especially to his parents Phil and April Margera and his uncle Don Vito.  When MTV granted Bam virtual carte blanche to do anything he so desired to annoy, tick off and otherwise drive his parents up the wall and back down it again the end result was ""Viva La Bam"".So how would our dear young Mr. Margera and his crazy band of friends (Ryan Dunn, Chris Raab aka ""Raab Himself"", Brandon DiCamillo and Rake Yohn)top the craziness and insanity caused in the first season of VLB?  The answer comes in Viva La Bam: The Complete 2nd and 3rd Seasons, the second volume in the VLB series on DVD.The first 2 discs, which contains all 8 episodes of the 2nd season (Disc 1) and all 8 of the 3rd season (Disc 2), begins essentially where season 1 ended: all of the antics of Bam and crew have forced the township to order Bam to move out of the area ASAP.  Bam goes on a house hunt and finds the perfect house to move into.However, when Bam and company move in (or at least begin the attempt to), Bam's brother Jess from the band CKY shows up and demands that Bam and crew hed to Amsterdam for a CKY concert.  Bam agrees and leaves Phil and April in charge of the moving in process.  But when Bam returns he hates what Ape does to the house and turns it into Castle Bam (simply put: his house his rules).Most of the events in the entire 2nd and 3rd seasons takes place in and around the new Margera house, ranging from Bam finding a Civil War cannonball on the grounds of his house to building a (literal) treetop casino, a classic episode that finds Johnny Knoxville paying a visit that suddenly turns into an all-out prank war, Bam inviting rock band Slayer to perform in his backyard (and the entire town of West Chester) to check it out), and more.The funnest events send everyone out of the state in some episodes, including Bam and the gang flying to Cali to get some serious celebrity swag for a new snakerun driveway that includes a visit to the Playboy Mansion, a 2-part episode that has Bam, Phil, April, Vito, the entire crew (save for Ryan Dunn) and several popular skaters going on a trip to Mardi Gras in New Orleans that turns from a 20 hour trip to one that goes for nearly 3 DAYS and turns into a hilarious prank war as well, which also turns into a sprint race between Dunn and everyone else to get there first, and a cruise that goes seriously askew when Don Vito is made the captain of the ship and ends with of all things a Blackhawk helicopter!The 3rd disc contains bonus features similar to what the 2nd disc of VLB Season 1 did: bonus scenes, deleted stuff and music videos.  The only thing that costs VLB Seasons 2 & 3 a star is the fact that the gang didn't add commentary for the episodes like they did last time.  That would probably given the set a full 5, but it is only a partial loss.So if you ever wish you could do, in the immortal words of Bam, ""whatever the ... I want"", then Viva La Bam: The Complete 2nd and 3rd Seasons is your wish being granted...",4,Just when you thought it was safe to be a parent...HE'S BACK!!!,1137110400,"01 13, 2006",2006,3092,"['Brandon', 'Margera', 'better', 'known', 'Bam', 'one', 'guy', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'ultimate', 'problem', 'child', 'especially', 'parents', 'Phil', 'April', 'Margera', 'uncle', 'Don', 'Vito', 'When', 'MTV', 'granted', 'Bam', 'virtual', 'carte', 'blanche', 'do', 'anything', 'so', 'desired', 'annoy', 'tick', 'off', 'otherwise', 'drive', 'parents', 'up', 'wall', 'back', 'again', 'end', 'result', 'was', 'Viva', 'La', 'Bam', 'how', 'would', 'dear', 'young', 'Mr.', 'Margera', 'crazy', 'band', 'friends', 'Ryan', 'Dunn', 'Chris', 'Raab', 'Raab', 'Himself', 'Brandon', 'DiCamillo', 'Rake', 'Yohn', 'top', 'craziness', 'insanity', 'caused', 'first', 'season', 'VLB', 'answer', 'Viva', 'La', 'Bam', 'Complete', '2nd', '3rd', 'Seasons', 'second', 'volume', 'VLB', 'series', 'DVD.The', 'first', '2', 'discs', '8', 'episodes', '2nd', 'season', 'Disc', '1', '8', '3rd', 'season', 'Disc', '2', 'essentially', 'where', 'season', '1', 'ended', 'antics', 'Bam', 'crew', 'have', 'forced', 'township', 'order', 'Bam', 'move', 'area', 'ASAP', 'Bam', 'house', 'hunt', 'perfect', 'house', 'move', 'into.However', 'when', 'Bam', 'company', 'move', 'least', 'begin', 'attempt', 'Bam', 'brother', 'Jess', 'band', 'CKY', 'up', 'demands', 'Bam', 'crew', 'hed', 'Amsterdam', 'CKY', 'concert', 'Bam', 'Phil', 'April', 'charge', 'moving', 'process', 'when', 'Bam', 'what', 'Ape', 'house', 'Castle', 'Bam', 'simply', 'put', 'house', 'rules', '.Most', 'events', 'entire', '2nd', '3rd', 'seasons', 'place', 'new', 'Margera', 'house', 'ranging', 'Bam', 'finding', 'Civil', 'War', 'cannonball', 'grounds', 'house', 'building', 'literal', 'treetop', 'casino', 'classic', 'episode', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'paying', 'visit', 'suddenly', 'all-out', 'prank', 'war', 'Bam', 'inviting', 'rock', 'band', 'Slayer', 'perform', 'backyard', 'entire', 'town', 'West', 'Chester', 'check', 'out', 'more.The', 'funnest', 'events', 'send', 'everyone', 'state', 'episodes', 'including', 'Bam', 'gang', 'flying', 'Cali', 'get', 'serious', 'celebrity', 'swag', 'new', 'snakerun', 'driveway', 'visit', 'Playboy', 'Mansion', '2-part', 'episode', 'Bam', 'Phil', 'April', 'Vito', 'entire', 'crew', 'save', 'Ryan', 'Dunn', 'several', 'popular', 'skaters', 'going', 'trip', 'Mardi', 'Gras', 'New', 'Orleans', '20', 'hour', 'trip', 'one', 'nearly', '3', 'DAYS', 'hilarious', 'prank', 'war', 'well', 'also', 'sprint', 'race', 'Dunn', 'everyone', 'else', 'get', 'there', 'first', 'cruise', 'seriously', 'askew', 'when', 'Don', 'Vito', 'made', 'captain', 'ship', 'things', 'Blackhawk', 'helicopter', '3rd', 'disc', 'contains', 'bonus', 'features', 'similar', 'what', '2nd', 'disc', 'VLB', 'Season', '1', 'did', 'bonus', 'scenes', 'deleted', 'stuff', 'music', 'videos', 'only', 'thing', 'VLB', 'Seasons', '2', '3', 'star', 'fact', 'gang', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'commentary', 'episodes', 'did', 'last', 'time', 'would', 'probably', 'given', 'set', 'full', '5', 'only', 'partial', 'loss.So', 'ever', 'wish', 'could', 'do', 'immortal', 'words', 'Bam', 'want', 'then', 'Viva', 'La', 'Bam', 'Complete', '2nd', '3rd', 'Seasons', 'wish', 'being', 'granted']",N/A
