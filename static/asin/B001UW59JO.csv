He is at his finest in this work, capturing foggy rivers, haze-free sunsets, ample forests filled with flora and pigs and actors dressed in appropriate era clothing.  The quality of the film itself is worthy of awards.  This is truly a gift from his heart.Benjamin Bratt's gentle voice adds to the narration.  He doesn't get overly emotinal when telling the story, as the scenes you watch at the same time say it all.  You are left to yourself to realize the brutality of that time.This is a three-disc set totalling about 470 minutes. Produced in widescreen, even on my CRT set I get a near-full screen.The first episode, ""After the Mayflower"" opens with 1621, the year the first settlers arrived off the shores of southeastern Massachusetts.  The research that went into this work is incredible, with many scenes spoken in the native language, in this case, Nipmuc.  The first Thanksgiving is realistically portrayed:  not with turkeys and cranberries, but with venison and wild berries.The second episode, ""Tecumseh's Vision"" demonstrates how the War of 1812 came to be:  Natives, who had sided with the British during the American Revolution (can you blame them?) now found themselves on foreign land.  They were pushed westward, west of Appalachia, where more battles ensued with the settlers and frontiersmen and trappers from France along the Great Lakes region.The Wabash and Tippecanoe rivers hold great history for both the Shawnee and the people who eventually settled along its banks.  The ""Vision"" however, was the loss of the first peoples who had lived along its banks.The ""Trail of Tears"" completes the second disc.The most emotional episodes are on the third disc, ""Geronimo"" and especially ""Wounded Knee,"" the episode that explains in 1973 news footage and interviews with some of the participants the reasons for the ""occupation"" that resulted in one death.  Wounded Knee encapsulates the forming of the Native activism, when all tribes united to preserve their languages and cultures and demanded equal rights before the law.If there is one flaw in this production it is that it doesn't include more episodes of the other tribes that suffered:  the Nez Perce at Big Hole, for example, or the Battle of Litte Big Horn.  Like one tribal member mentioned in the ""Wounded Knee"" episode:  ""Every tribe has its memory of violence (with the US government)"" and to document them all would take up much more footage and disc space than is given here.Still, it's a beautiful production that leaves any viewer sighing ""Wow!"" at the end.This documentary is from the Native American's point of view, but the transcript does not just weigh heavily with the Indians:  facts are not twisted or left out.  When angry Wampanoag went from village to village to kill settlers, we know that they had reached a boiling point with Old World trespassers that would only get worse as the years went on.",5,"Truly ground-breaking, truly Beautiful",1240012800,"04 18, 2009",2009,3013,"['time', 'something', 'produced', 'what', 'better', 'director', 'use', 'Chris', 'Eyre', 'director', 'finest', 'work', 'capturing', 'foggy', 'rivers', 'haze-free', 'sunsets', 'ample', 'forests', 'filled', 'flora', 'pigs', 'actors', 'dressed', 'appropriate', 'era', 'clothing', 'quality', 'film', 'worthy', 'awards', 'truly', 'gift', 'heart.Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'gentle', 'voice', 'narration', ""n't"", 'get', 'overly', 'emotinal', 'when', 'telling', 'story', 'scenes', 'watch', 'same', 'time', 'say', 'are', 'left', 'yourself', 'realize', 'brutality', 'time.This', 'three-disc', 'set', 'totalling', '470', 'minutes', 'Produced', 'widescreen', 'even', 'CRT', 'set', 'get', 'near-full', 'screen.The', 'first', 'episode', 'Mayflower', '1621', 'year', 'first', 'settlers', 'arrived', 'off', 'shores', 'southeastern', 'Massachusetts', 'research', 'went', 'work', 'incredible', 'many', 'scenes', 'spoken', 'native', 'language', 'case', 'Nipmuc', 'first', 'Thanksgiving', 'realistically', 'portrayed', 'not', 'turkeys', 'cranberries', 'venison', 'wild', 'berries.The', 'second', 'episode', 'Tecumseh', 'Vision', 'how', 'War', '1812', 'came', 'be', 'Natives', 'who', 'had', 'sided', 'British', 'American', 'Revolution', 'can', 'blame', 'now', 'found', 'foreign', 'land', 'were', 'pushed', 'westward', 'west', 'Appalachia', 'where', 'more', 'battles', 'ensued', 'settlers', 'frontiersmen', 'trappers', 'France', 'Great', 'Lakes', 'region.The', 'Wabash', 'Tippecanoe', 'rivers', 'hold', 'great', 'history', 'Shawnee', 'people', 'who', 'eventually', 'settled', 'along', 'banks', 'Vision', 'however', 'was', 'loss', 'first', 'peoples', 'who', 'had', 'lived', 'banks.The', 'Trail', 'Tears', 'second', 'disc.The', 'most', 'emotional', 'episodes', 'are', 'third', 'disc', 'Geronimo', 'especially', 'Wounded', 'Knee', 'episode', '1973', 'news', 'footage', 'interviews', 'participants', 'reasons', 'occupation', 'resulted', 'one', 'death', 'Wounded', 'Knee', 'forming', 'Native', 'activism', 'when', 'tribes', 'united', 'preserve', 'languages', 'cultures', 'demanded', 'equal', 'rights', 'law.If', 'one', 'flaw', 'production', ""n't"", 'include', 'more', 'episodes', 'other', 'tribes', 'suffered', 'Nez', 'Perce', 'Big', 'Hole', 'example', 'Battle', 'Litte', 'Big', 'Horn', 'one', 'tribal', 'member', 'mentioned', 'Wounded', 'Knee', 'episode', 'tribe', 'memory', 'violence', 'US', 'government', 'document', 'would', 'take', 'up', 'much', 'more', 'footage', 'disc', 'space', 'given', 'here.Still', 'beautiful', 'production', 'viewer', 'sighing', 'Wow', 'end.This', 'documentary', 'Native', 'American', 'point', 'view', 'transcript', 'not', 'just', 'weigh', 'heavily', 'Indians', 'facts', 'are', 'not', 'twisted', 'left', 'out', 'When', 'angry', 'Wampanoag', 'went', 'village', 'village', 'kill', 'settlers', 'know', 'had', 'reached', 'boiling', 'point', 'Old', 'World', 'would', 'only', 'get', 'worse', 'years', 'went']",We Shall Remain: America Through Native Eyes

I hope schools across the country are playing this for students.I can't knock a single episode but for me, in some ways the Cherokee installment is The One. Why? Because more than any other, it illustrates the fact that there was nothing any of the tribal peoples here could have done to to work with or appease the US government into letting them survive as Nations on ancestral homelands, culturally entact or not. The Cherokee, as one of the ""5 Civilized Tribes"" (along with the Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee and Seminole), did everything the Americans could have asked and wanted from an indigenous people. For nearly all intents and purposes, the Cherokee become White Americans in all but skin color. They had an alphabet, they owned and worked in American-style businesses, they became owners of black slaves, they adopted American-style government, etc...No one could have done more to Americanize. No one could have done more to accept the new path being offered them, yet when all was said and done, they were just Indians and would be treated and removed as such.I've watched every episode several times and it never fails to get to me.

What is disheartening is the producers are informed enough to absolutely KNOW they are presenting an incredibly biased accounting of events in 1973.The A.I.M. hostages really WERE hostages and treated badly.  During the siege, A.I.M. raided and ransacked dozens of houses and ranches, owned by Indians and whites, taking cattle, chickens, and committing wanton and pointless destruction of property.  A.I.M. assassinated opponents.  Their portrayal of Dick Wilson was a complete caricature.By other accounts I have read, the F.B.I and Marshals used a high degree of restraint with weapons:  Something that cannot be said for the A.I.M. militants.  Whenever the government would accede to A.I.M. demands, the A.I.M. leaders would immediately increase their demands ( in other words, they didn't WANT a peaceful solution ).I could go on.  Mind you, this from someone who started out completely in sympathy with the A.I.M. faction.  I have read much more on the subject recently.Did the full-bloods and A.I.M. have legitimate complaints?  Certainly.  Did they deal with the situation in a responsible and mature manner?

A capitalist system demands free labor and that is what America got with the import of African slaves who created great wealth for the country.  The Spanish conquered Mexico and used the indigenous people to work in the gold and silver mines, while the US moved the Indians to reservations and subverted their cultures. We went on to remove elected leaders in Latin America and replace them with people who favored US corporate interests operating in their country. We even convinced the Chilean military to bomb the National Palace to kill an elected president and replace him with General Pinochet, an extreme right wing president who murdered hundreds of students and put them in unmarked graves.
