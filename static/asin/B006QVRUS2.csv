1519094,A3SZXYX9YEDGT6,B006QVRUS2,"Addison Dewitt ""I'm nobody's fool.""","[4, 8]","One boy hits another boy with a stick, but it's all four parents that really duke it out. In what seems to be an almost-too-long, dialogue-filled postage stamp of a movie, the four actors do their best to hold up what is actually a modest concept film which started life as a play. The entire story is played out in the living room of one couple, played with variable success by Jodie Foster and John C. Reilly, as they entertain, argue and ultimately throw out the other couple, played with a bit more finesse by Kate Winslet and Christoph Waltz.Foster comes off the worst of the foursome, over-acting and seemingly struggling with getting her part to look natural. Reilly is alternately affable and clumsily angry, an easy stretch for him. Winslet is near-perfect as a spoiled commodities broker, but the real pro here is Waltz. His subtle, schmoozy-yet-sleazy low-voiced lawyer schtick is spot on and provides the anchor to what could have easily fallen into disarray.Do yourself a favor and ignore all obvious comparisons to ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf."" This mini-duplicate stops short of any real, serious drama and these four people's problems (and much of the acting) pale in comparison to the earlier film's premise. Loss of a child, emasculation by a whore-of-a-wife, alchohol abuse writ large, and more. There's just not as much meat on this film's bones but it's also much easier to take.The movie's script covers a lot of bases and the story line becomes a mini-mirror of society in a nutshell. What the two couples want to do is behave as civilly as possible and handle the mini-crisis as politely as possible. What happens in the end is the complete opposite and that in itself is a metaphor for various aspects of humanity: We want to be our best, but, unfortunately, at times devolve into our worst.There is some nice camera work here too, lenses are switched to near-fisheye and the camera gets shaky when the foursome get a bit tipsy on good scotch. The wide shots are filled with a perfectly dressed, &uuml;ber-smart NY apartment, complete with the statuary and artworks that any upper west-side intelligencia would possess. The apartment's only flaw happens halfway through the film, when a gastric surprise takes it down a peg. Some clever bits with art direction as well, when the camera captures action in the background or framed in mirrors depicting a duality of actions and philosophies.All in all, not a bad rendition of this work. I would surmise that given more time for character development or perhaps more rehearsals, Foster could have done a better job with out reaching so far for what is already in her grasp. This is a far cry from what I'm used to seeing from her, thus the reduction of one star.

1519095,AAZRWLML88IZK,B006QVRUS2,A kids review,"[1, 2]","Here's a recipe for tension: put Jodie Foster, John C. Reilly, Christoph Waltz, and Kate Winslet in a room, add a pinch of disagreement, simmer, and serve. Roman Polanski's Carnage sticks to those particulars throughout its 80-minute runtime, and though I found it a bit too stage-bound to truly take flight as a film, I simply enjoyed watching these four fine actors rip each other to shreds. A pair of married couples meets for a polite chat after a playground dispute between their respective children. However, it isn't long before any veneer of civility is stripped away, and the situation devolves into an out-and-out cage match of verbal sparring and bitterness. It isn't as compelling on the screen as it was on the stage, but Carnage makes up for its flaws with Polanski's smooth direction and assured performances from Winslet and Foster.",3,Carnage,1332288000,"03 21, 2012",2012,848,"['Here', 'recipe', 'tension', 'put', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'Christoph', 'Waltz', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'room', 'add', 'pinch', 'disagreement', 'simmer', 'serve', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'Carnage', 'sticks', 'particulars', '80-minute', 'runtime', 'found', 'bit', 'too', 'stage-bound', 'truly', 'take', 'flight', 'film', 'simply', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'four', 'fine', 'actors', 'rip', 'other', 'shreds', 'pair', 'married', 'couples', 'meets', 'polite', 'chat', 'playground', 'dispute', 'respective', 'children', 'However', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'veneer', 'civility', 'stripped', 'away', 'situation', 'out-and-out', 'cage', 'match', 'verbal', 'sparring', 'bitterness', ""n't"", 'compelling', 'screen', 'was', 'stage', 'Carnage', 'up', 'flaws', 'Polanski', 'smooth', 'direction', 'assured', 'performances', 'Winslet', 'Foster']",Carnage
1519096,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B006QVRUS2,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[0, 1]","On a pleasant schoolday afternoon, four parents assemble in a tony Brooklyn apartment.  The hosts are mom and dad of the boy who had two teeth knocked out in a nearby public park, a passionate museum curator (Jodie Foster) and a complacent businessman (John C. O'Reilly).  The guests are parents of the boy who wielded the big stick, a sleek financial planner (Kate Winslet) and an amoral Yuppie lawyer (Christoph Waltz).  The couples meet, take an immediate dislike to each other, but decide to stick it out for the sake of Getting It Over With.  They fence tentatively back and forth, but are unable to settle on any real goals.  The interlopers prepare to leave, but out comes the 18-year-old artisanal Scotch, several rounds are downed, and the masks of civilization start to wear thin.The level of acting is very high in this satire of bourgeois relations, which originated as a French play, was translated into English and then imported from London's West End.  Christoph Waltz, though not well known to American moviegoers, is a native Viennese actor of great range and sophistication; here he plays with tremendous aplomb the unscrupulous products-liabilty lawyer with an attachment to nothing but his cell phone.  Kate Winslet is her usual wonderful self, here playing a too-well-groomed financial maven whose unlikeabilty comes increasingly to the fore.  John C. Reilly -- is there any kind of character he cannot play? -- is engagingly disagreeable as the Babbitty restaurant-goods warehouse owner whose passions seem to be channeled almost entirely into luxury consumer goods.  But the real revelation in this chamber piece must be Jodie Foster; as CARNAGE progresses we can practically see her character's ego-mass erode, crumbling like her ""signature"" slumgullion apple-pear cobbler and freezing her into a mask of potent hysteria.  Along the way, vomiting takes place, all-too-temporary alliances form along lines of politics and gender, and finally both women proclaim it to be the worst day of their very separate lives.  Then it ends.Perhaps it's better to leave the audience begging for more, but this all too-brief-a-treat couldn't help remind me of Edward Albee's play WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?, especially the 1966 movie version with Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor, George Segal and Sandy Dennis.  Just when you thought you couldn't take anymore, to paraphrase Burton's character, the destruction goes further in that play/movie's third act, ""Walpurgisnacht.""  But at 80 minutes with no ""opening up,"" CARNAGE is at best an extended one-acter.  How I wish that the dramatic action had intensified, and smirk come to shove.  How I would have liked to see a longer version of this movie and proclaim it a five-star entertainment.  I can't, but those interested can buy or rent CARNAGE and at the same time avail themselves of WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? in order to weigh the differences for themselves.",4,"""We bought tulips!

1519097,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B006QVRUS2,Amit Talpade,"[0, 1]","The film is based on Yasmina Reza's Tony Award-winning hit French play God of Carnage is about the artificial fabric of civility being torn apart over a simple matter. Nancy and Alan (Kate Winslet Christoph Waltz), are visiting the apartment of Penelope ( Jodie Foster) and Michael ( John C. Reilly)because their son hit the other couples son with a stick on the playground, breaking two of his teeth. The setting is the apartment and the four characters are the only actors in the film and lasts for only 80 minutes.The events start politely, as the couple try to hash out their differences but then the accusing begins, leading to the couples fighting with each other, man against man, woman against man, taking sides and ultimately their civility is ripped to pieces. The confrontations become less and less about their children and more about their views on marriage and the state of it.The movie can be best described as an acting showcase,  Christoph Waltz, Kate Winslet, Jodie Foster and John C. Reilly are such fantastic actors that they could recite the phone directory and make it interesting. I personally thought that Waltz was the best, followed closely by Winslet, Reilly and Foster in that order.Though not the best effort from Polanski, it is still a fine film. 4 stars. 4/10/2012",3,Parental breakdown,1334361600,"04 14, 2012",2012,1296,"['film', 'based', 'Yasmina', 'Reza', 'Tony', 'Award-winning', 'hit', 'French', 'play', 'God', 'Carnage', 'artificial', 'fabric', 'civility', 'being', 'torn', 'apart', 'simple', 'matter', 'Nancy', 'Alan', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Christoph', 'Waltz', 'are', 'visiting', 'apartment', 'Penelope', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Michael', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'son', 'hit', 'other', 'couples', 'son', 'stick', 'playground', 'breaking', 'two', 'teeth', 'setting', 'apartment', 'four', 'characters', 'are', 'only', 'actors', 'film', 'lasts', 'only', '80', 'minutes.The', 'events', 'start', 'politely', 'couple', 'try', 'hash', 'out', 'differences', 'then', 'accusing', 'leading', 'couples', 'fighting', 'other', 'man', 'man', 'woman', 'man', 'taking', 'sides', 'ultimately', 'civility', 'ripped', 'pieces', 'confrontations', 'become', 'less', 'less', 'children', 'more', 'views', 'marriage', 'state', 'it.The', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'best', 'described', 'acting', 'showcase', 'Christoph', 'Waltz', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'are', 'such', 'fantastic', 'actors', 'could', 'recite', 'phone', 'directory', 'make', 'interesting', 'personally', 'thought', 'Waltz', 'was', 'best', 'followed', 'closely', 'Winslet', 'Reilly', 'Foster', 'not', 'best', 'effort', 'Polanski', 'still', 'fine', 'film', '4', 'stars', '4/10/2012']",Carnage

1519099,A2I4VTPKGSQZ75,B006QVRUS2,Anthony Hand,"[0, 0]","In what I presume to be an excellent adaptation of the play, Roman Polanski's 'Carnage' focuses on the parents of two boys, one of which has attacked another with a stick and caused some facial damage, including knocking out a couple of teeth.In an effort to remain civil, the parents of the ""attacker"" visit the home of the ""victim"" in order to sort out the problem.From the very beginning, there's a kind of 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf' style tension in the room that is always threatening to expand into something much worse, despite the fact that both sets of parents are initially interested in civil discourse. As events unfold, gradually the parents attitudes change and things become more and more uncomfortable.'Carnage', due to Polanski's excellent handling of the directorial reins, never spills over into farce, even though the story threatens to do so at times. It's kept controlled and simmering, the tension lasts the whole running time and unlike the aforementioned Elizabeth Taylor film (as great as it is), it stays somewhat within the realms of reality.The film is also helped immensely by excellent performances by the four leads, especially from Jodie Foster who just grabs her part and goes at it with great gusto. She also has the hardest role to play.A short film that doesn't do anything more than expected of it and well worth a view.",4,Carnage,1347840000,"09 17, 2012",2012,1364,"['what', 'presume', 'be', 'excellent', 'adaptation', 'play', 'Roman', 'Polanski', ""'Carnage"", 'focuses', 'parents', 'two', 'boys', 'one', 'attacked', 'stick', 'caused', 'facial', 'damage', 'including', 'knocking', 'out', 'couple', 'teeth.In', 'effort', 'remain', 'civil', 'parents', 'attacker', 'home', 'victim', 'order', 'sort', 'out', 'problem.From', 'very', 'beginning', 'kind', ""'Who"", 'Afraid', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'style', 'tension', 'room', 'always', 'threatening', 'expand', 'something', 'much', 'worse', 'fact', 'sets', 'parents', 'are', 'initially', 'interested', 'civil', 'discourse', 'events', 'unfold', 'gradually', 'parents', 'attitudes', 'change', 'things', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'uncomfortable', ""'Carnage"", 'due', 'Polanski', 'excellent', 'handling', 'directorial', 'reins', 'never', 'over', 'farce', 'even', 'story', 'do', 'so', 'times', 'kept', 'controlled', 'simmering', 'tension', 'whole', 'running', 'time', 'aforementioned', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'film', 'as', 'great', 'somewhat', 'realms', 'reality.The', 'film', 'also', 'helped', 'immensely', 'excellent', 'performances', 'four', 'leads', 'especially', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'who', 'just', 'grabs', 'part', 'great', 'gusto', 'also', 'hardest', 'role', 'play.A', 'short', 'film', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'more', 'expected', 'well', 'view']",Carnage
1519100,A2582KMXLK2P06,B006QVRUS2,B. E Jackson,"[2, 4]","Wow, I never EVER would have guessed that Carnage would be as good as it was.  The first 10 minutes didn't really indicate which direction this movie was going until I stuck with it for a while.  Reading the description does NOT reveal exactly what kind of movie this is.  Please keep this in mind.It's NOT some family-friendly typically outrageous Disney-like adventure about two parents that get into a fight over who's really responsible for the son of Jodie Foster and John C. Reilly getting his mouth busted up as a result of a fight with another kid.  The movie description makes it seem like it very well *could* have been, however.  So what does Jodie and John's characters do?They invite the parents over (played by Kate Winslet and Christopher Waltz) to try and figure out what exactly happened involving Jodie and John's child losing a couple teeth, and what to do about it.  Are they going to discuss and figure out things like rational adults?  Maybe for a while, however... this is where the darkness of the comedy comes in.  Gradually- very slowly and precisely using clever words as a way to get in little digs and insults so to speak- the storyline unravels until the four parents eventually explode into several different types of emotions.However the unique thing about the concept is that, there's a feeling of believability to the whole thing.  It seems entirely realistic that Jodie and John's characters would invite the parents over to have a rational conversation as a way to sort out what actually happened.  It seems realistic that emotions would change -and that the friendly tone would suddenly disappear in a hurry- depending on the way the other parents interpret and defend the actions of their child.But... the movie writers take it a step further just to put the icing on this already well-written and delicious cake.  Whenever Jodie starts getting angry, her husband is always there to calm her down.  Whenever John gets out of line, Jodie is there to calm him down.  The same situation applies to Kate and Christopher's wife and husband characters.  This is EXACTLY what couples do, and the portrayal is really accurate in this movie.  Job well done there.  Both parents are simply defending their child's actions but *nobody* wants to lose their cool (well, not at first anyway).SO many outrageous accusations and events take place through this relatively short 80-minute movie, that you really have to stick with it to discover all the nooks and crannies.  There's a lot of depth to the development of the characters and the emotions they reveal.  Really rewarding movie in my opinion.The ending... oh boy the ending (during the credits I mean).  Well there's probably at least two ways to interpret it, though I strongly believe I know which one the writers were going for.  I won't spoil it though.  It's too much information at once.  I'm too much of a nice guy for that!Another thing I find unintentionally hilarious is how Kate Winslet and Christopher Waltz constantly try to rationalize their sons uncontrollable and angry behavior claiming that ""boys will be boys"" and he couldn't (can't) help his actions.  Also that kids at that age will be violent due to not knowing any better, so there's really no way to avoid it.  While plausible that kids may be violent sometimes, I believe their logic is wrong compared to Jodie Foster's at least (who believes such behavior is unacceptable and that her son wasn't able to defend himself from a smack against his face).

1519104,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B006QVRUS2,Brian Driver,"[1, 2]","There's an old SNL skit starring Will Ferrell that depicted a TV newscast team as it lost its teleprompter, and the ensuing bloodbath that eventually occurred.  The term ""bloodbath"" was correctly used, as the lack of prepared text somehow paves the way for the news team to devolve into its primal state, and by the end of ten minutes they actually begin cannibalizing one another in the midst of its hyperbolic chaos.The movie ""Carnage"" will probably impress you in much the same way.  Essentially a long one-act play, it enacts the meeting of two relatively affluent married couples who have previously agreed to get together in the living room of one of their apartments to discuss a previous spat involving their eleven year old sons on an urban playground, wherein one boy struck the other in the face with a stick.You might expect that that thread of a story is perhaps not enough to base a movie upon, especially given the fact that there is almost no change of setting other than a brief bathroom scene.  But you'd be wrong.  In fact, I was surprised when it ended a mere 75 minutes later.First off, ""Carnage"" is hilarious.  And what pedigree: directed by Roman Polanski, its cast consists entirely of Christoph Waltz, Kate Winslet, John C. Reilly, and Jodie Foster, other than a couple of long distance shots of some important secondary characters.Equally important is this statement: be aware this is Theater of the Uncomfortable.  If you are not a fan of, say, a long elevator ride with an arguing couple, you might not be able to sit through this film.  But if you can stick it out you will be richly rewarded.The movie begins with the wrapping up of a typed statement by the parents of the injured boy, with only one word substitution suggested by the parents of the boy who struck the other: originally said to be ""armed"" with a stick, it is later changed to ""carrying.""  That said, Penelope (Foster) prints out the letter, the two couples separate to head out to an elevator as her husband Michael (played by Reilly) innocently suggests they might like to stay for an espresso.  With a nod, Alan and Nancy (Weisz and Winslet), step back into the apartment.And so it begins...Please take me at my word: this movie gets very uncomfortable.  As each couple absorbs or makes little digs and innuendos, it initially appears that the battle lines will be clear: it's the Cowans vs. the Longstreets, and when it all eventually breaks down it is natural to assume each parent will vigorously defend their son.At first terribly polite, the couples' marital issues are egged on by incessant phone calls and dog barks and alcohol and, well, vomit, forcing bothersome traits and affectionate nicknames and paranoias and prejudices to surface in all their ugliness.Yet there's much, much more, and I think it is fair to say that no one survives this debacle.  Not that we will witness the outcome; no, as I mentioned before, the film ends abruptly, but by then the battle lines have become so blurred and far-ranging that it is fair to say that the boys are the least of the offenders.  To paraphrase an old expression: no one gets out of here undamaged.I don't want to say too much...the beauty of this extremely talented cast is that they are able to ante up little moments and idiosyncrasies until they become cannon-fire, and there is no one here that I can truly admire when it's all over.  The skirmish between two boys get equal time alongside a pharmaceutical company's liabilities, the situation in Darfur, or the killing of a hamster.So, see ""Carnage.""

After their son whacks another boy on the playground, Kate Winslet and Christoph Waltz visit Jodie Foster and John C. Reilly. What is meant to be a brief social call, where the parents discuss their children's conflict amicably, turns into a hell for everyone involved. In spite of their goodbyes and promises to arrange a later meeting, Winslet and Waltz can't seem to leave. And every time they are called back to a cup of coffee or a piece of cake, the tension in the room is higher and higher. CARNAGE expresses Sartre's view that hell is other people, but it also shows that hell is ourselves when we can't manage to get away from a stressful situation and regain composure.This is an elegant film which retains the simplicity and intimacy of its theatre origins. With a script stripped to the bare essentials, it has no other goal that to display the interaction between four characters over an 80-minute span, and in this it succeeds nicely. The only weakness, is Foster's performance, which rises too abruptly to hysteria and sometimes seems forced, and it's a bit hard to swallow that John C. Reilly's character is married to Foster's.

The whole film takes place in a chic New York apartment where two sets of parents are discussing a fight that occurred between their two children causing one of them to lose a couple of teeth. Jodie Foster and John C. Reilly are the parents of the injured child, and Jodie plays the upset mother who wants an apology from the son of the other parents and considers herself very a very conscientious parent. Kate Winslet and Christopher Waltz are the other set of parents, who&#8217;s child they admit is hard to manage, and is trying to appease Jodie and John but gets angered with Jodie&#8217;s fussy tone. Kate and Chris, both have busy careers, problems in their marriage, and lack time to deal with this issue. In addition, Chris is dealing with a work crisis and keeps taking phone calls during this meeting. The couple attempts to leave multiple times but keeps getting dragged back in when something else arises. Eventually the talk moves away from the kids and more to issues between the dynamics of the couples.

1519111,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B006QVRUS2,C. Sawin,"[13, 24]","I have a lot of catching up to do when it comes to Roman Polanski films. Rosemary's Baby, Chinatown, and The Pianist are all patiently biding their time in my Netflix queue waiting on me to get around to them and watch them for the first time. The Polanski films I have seen had the potential to be great, but kind of let everything they had going for it slip through the cracks as the film went on. I remember being fascinated by The Ninth Gate, but was extremely disappointed once the ending rolled around. There was also quite a bit of praise being thrown around for The Ghost Writer last year and it just didn't affect me the way any of that praise did for other critics. So while Carnage has gotten many accolades as one of the funniest movies of last year, I took it with a grain of salt. People seem to generally love Polanski and that's fine. His films are genuinely a pleasure to look at as the cinematography is always fantastic, but it certainly seems as though he may not be as great as everyone makes him out to be.Carnage is basically a 74-minute discussion between two couples whose eleven and twelve year old sons got into a fight. Penelope (Jodie Foster) and Michael Longstreet's (John C. Reilly) son Ethan was struck in the face with a stick by Zachary, the son of Nancy (Kate Winslet) and Alan Cowan (Christoph Waltz). The parents get together to try and find a way for Zachary and Ethan to talk things out, but everything eventually falls apart and the two couples are eventually at each other's throats.This was not the hilarious movie it was made out to be. While the other people in the theater seemed to be howling at everything on screen, it mostly just felt slightly snicker worthy at times. John C. Reilly is pretty funny. His views, the things that come out of his mouth, his character, and his performance are probably the closest thing to hilarious Carnage has to offer. ""Is cobbler cake or pie?"", the flush mechanisms conversation, ""You certainly perked up after..."", the hamster story, the doodle nickname being ridiculous, and ""YOU'RE BLOWING THIS OUT OF PROPORTION!"" are all mostly entertaining thanks to John C. Reilly's over the top performance. Michael Longstreet is probably the closest you'll come to relating to one of the on-screen characters, as well. The film is mostly a competition between four egomaniacal individuals competing for the spotlight though. Christoph Waltz's ""god of carnage"" speech is pretty amazing as is the ""disfigured his schoolmate"" conversation, but you want to slap the hell out of Alan Cowan the minute you realize he cherishes his phone more than anything else in the world. Kate Winslet is mostly nauseous and drunk the entire film and you probably won't walk away from this without thinking of Jodie Foster's bulbous, veiny, pulsating neck. Seriously, that thing will probably haunt your dreams the night after seeing this.Carnage is very short. It feels like it ends as soon as it begins. It's like Cloverfield length. It also has one of the worst endings ever. How many films can you name that stop with a phone call? Nothing is resolved. Everything just stops. Despite a wonderful cast and a few chuckle worthy moments, Carnage mostly falls flat. It comes off as more of a contest between two married couples that become more interested in pointing out the flaws of their marriage rather than the task at hand. Maybe it's because I work in retail and I witness these kinds of conversations on a daily basis, but it just wasn't very entertaining at all. Carnage stumbles on the thin line between being extremely annoying and being mildly amusing.",2,What in the world does everyone see in this film?,1326758400,"01 17, 2012",2012,3619,"['have', 'lot', 'catching', 'up', 'do', 'when', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'films', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'Chinatown', 'Pianist', 'are', 'patiently', 'biding', 'time', 'Netflix', 'queue', 'waiting', 'get', 'watch', 'first', 'time', 'Polanski', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'great', 'kind', 'let', 'everything', 'had', 'going', 'cracks', 'film', 'went', 'remember', 'being', 'fascinated', 'Ninth', 'Gate', 'was', 'extremely', 'disappointed', 'ending', 'rolled', 'around', 'was', 'also', 'quite', 'bit', 'praise', 'being', 'thrown', 'Ghost', 'Writer', 'last', 'year', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'affect', 'way', 'praise', 'did', 'other', 'critics', 'So', 'while', 'Carnage', 'gotten', 'many', 'accolades', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', 'last', 'year', 'took', 'grain', 'salt', 'People', 'seem', 'generally', 'love', 'Polanski', 'fine', 'films', 'are', 'genuinely', 'pleasure', 'look', 'cinematography', 'always', 'fantastic', 'certainly', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'great', 'everyone', 'out', 'be.Carnage', 'basically', '74-minute', 'discussion', 'two', 'couples', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'year', 'old', 'sons', 'got', 'fight', 'Penelope', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Michael', 'Longstreet', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'son', 'Ethan', 'was', 'struck', 'face', 'stick', 'Zachary', 'son', 'Nancy', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Alan', 'Cowan', 'Christoph', 'Waltz', 'parents', 'get', 'together', 'try', 'find', 'way', 'Zachary', 'Ethan', 'talk', 'things', 'out', 'everything', 'eventually', 'apart', 'two', 'couples', 'are', 'eventually', 'other', 'throats.This', 'was', 'not', 'hilarious', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'other', 'people', 'theater', 'seemed', 'be', 'howling', 'everything', 'screen', 'mostly', 'just', 'felt', 'slightly', 'snicker', 'worthy', 'times', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'pretty', 'funny', 'views', 'things', 'come', 'mouth', 'character', 'performance', 'are', 'probably', 'closest', 'thing', 'hilarious', 'Carnage', 'offer', 'cobbler', 'cake', 'pie', 'flush', 'mechanisms', 'conversation', 'certainly', 'perked', 'up', 'hamster', 'story', 'doodle', 'nickname', 'being', 'ridiculous', 'YOU', ""'RE"", 'BLOWING', 'THIS', 'OUT', 'OF', 'PROPORTION', 'are', 'mostly', 'entertaining', 'thanks', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'top', 'performance', 'Michael', 'Longstreet', 'probably', 'closest', ""'ll"", 'come', 'relating', 'one', 'on-screen', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'mostly', 'competition', 'four', 'egomaniacal', 'individuals', 'competing', 'spotlight', 'Christoph', 'Waltz', 'god', 'carnage', 'speech', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'disfigured', 'schoolmate', 'conversation', 'want', 'slap', 'hell', 'Alan', 'Cowan', 'minute', 'realize', 'phone', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'world', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'mostly', 'nauseous', 'drunk', 'entire', 'film', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'walk', 'away', 'thinking', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'bulbous', 'veiny', 'pulsating', 'neck', 'Seriously', 'thing', 'will', 'probably', 'haunt', 'dreams', 'night', 'seeing', 'this.Carnage', 'very', 'short', 'as', 'soon', 'like', 'Cloverfield', 'length', 'also', 'one', 'worst', 'endings', 'ever', 'How', 'many', 'films', 'can', 'name', 'stop', 'phone', 'call', 'Nothing', 'resolved', 'Everything', 'just', 'stops', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'few', 'chuckle', 'worthy', 'moments', 'Carnage', 'mostly', 'flat', 'off', 'more', 'contest', 'two', 'married', 'couples', 'become', 'more', 'interested', 'pointing', 'out', 'flaws', 'marriage', 'rather', 'task', 'hand', 'work', 'retail', 'witness', 'kinds', 'conversations', 'daily', 'basis', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'entertaining', 'Carnage', 'thin', 'line', 'being', 'extremely', 'annoying', 'being', 'mildly', 'amusing']",Carnage
1519112,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B006QVRUS2,DanD,"[1, 3]","Roman Polanski's CARNAGE is a savage little film that desires nothing less than to undercut both marriage and parenthood.  It revolves around two couples: uptight Penelope (Jodie Foster) and annoyingly placating Michael (John C. Reilly), and tightly-wound Nancy (Kate Winslet) and distracted business man Alan (Cristoph Waltz).  They've met to discuss a fight between their two children, and immediately the differences between the couples become glaring.  As the film progresses, the couples turn on themselves, so that eventually they're identifying with each other by criticizing their own spouses.It's a bleak film.  No violence, no gore, minimal cursing, but it's still a bleak, bitter film.  And yet immensely hilarious; Polanski and co-writer (and original playwright) Yasmina Reza have a truly twisted sense of humor, and find a great joke in the most disturbing situations. (When Penelope exclaims, ""Your son brutalized our son!"", Alan rejoins, ""They're young!"")  The four leads are admirable; it's nice to see Foster deliver a knockout performance again; Reilly gets another chance, after his rise to fame as a comedy actor, to go back to his dramatic chops; and Winslet and Waltz are at their primal best.And that's it.  Four great actors, one room, and a hallway.  There's humor, and there's tension, and at the center is a debate about parental blame: maybe your kids aren't messed up, maybe it's you.  CARNAGE isn't a perfect movie (the female characters are a bit too similar at times, and the ending comes rather abruptly, with only a feeble attempt at resolution), but it's certainly a good one, and earns its place among Polanskis' better (if maybe not best) films.",4,"""We're born alone, and we die alone.

Roman Polanski frames the film in such a way that you feel a stifling effect in the film's opening moments.  These instances are the best as tensions bubble just beneath the surface as coffee and cobbler are served.  It's when emotions erupt in the second half as misspoken words and glasses of scotch are bandied about that the film is less successful.  Christoph Waltz and John C. Reilly are fine expressing the right degree of sarcasm and righteous indignation.  Strangely Jodie Foster and Kate Winslet are somewhat subdued in these moments.  It isn't that they are quarrelling over the playground scuffle their respective sons engaged in rather it is class warfare.

A wonderful performance by Jodie Foster, Kate Winslet, Christoph Waltz and John C. Reilly.In France, Yasmina Reza's 2006 successful play ""Le Dieu du carnage"" (God of Carnage) is widely acclaimed.  Having received multiple awards and productions all over the world, the play received its film adaptation in 2011 courtesy of Roman Polanski (""The Pianist"", ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""Chinatown"").The film stars  Jodie Foster (""The Silence of the Lambs"", ""Panic Room"", ""Contact""), Kate Winslet (""Titanic"", ""Revolutionary Road"", ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind""), Christoph Waltz (""Inglorious Basterds"", ""The Green Hornet"", ""Water for Elephants"") and  John C. Reilly (""Magnolia"", ""Boogie Nights"", ""The Aviator"", ""Step Brothers"").The film would earn a Golden Globe nomination for ""Best Actress"" for Jodie Foster and Kate Winslet, including a Cesar Award nomination for ""Best Writing - Adaptation"" for Roman Polanski and Yasmina Reza.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Carnage"" is presented in 2:35:1 anamorphic widescreen and audio in English, French 5.0 Dolby Digital.  Before I go on, it's important to note that this film will be released on Blu-ray, so if you want the best picture and audio quality, I recommend watching it on HD.With that being said, ""Carnage"" is a film that takes place entirely in a set featuring a living room, bathroom, hallway and computer room.  Most of the scenes of the film are in the living room.  So for those expecting a variety of scenes taking place in multiple locations, this is not one of those films.  ""Carnage"" is a film that focuses on characters, emotion and full-on verbal assaults.On DVD, picture quality is good but of course, I'm sure you will see much more clarity and detail from the Blu-ray version.  As for the audio, dialogue is clear and heard no hiss or any problems at all.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Carnage"" comes with the following special features:Actor's Notes - (10:38) The cast of ""Carnage"" talk about the storyline and the characters they play.An Evening with John C. Reilly and Christoph Waltz - (38:01) Featuring an interview Q&A; with ""Carnage"" actors John C. Reilly and Christoph Waltz who talk about working on ""Carnage"", working with Roman Polanski and more.On the Red Carpet - (3:31) Interviews with the cast on the red carpet premiere.Theatrical Trailer - (2:04) The original theatrical trailer for ""Carnage"".JUDGMENT CALL:Roman Polanski's ""Carnage"" film adaptation of the popular Yasmina Reza play is hilarious, chaotic and features magnificent performances by Jodie Foster, Kate Winslet, Christoph Waltz and John C. Reilly.I absolutely enjoyed this film to see how a simple conversation became complex and the intensity of the verbal assaults was hilarious and the performances, so powerful!  I have watched many films of conversations between individuals and there are some films such as ""My Dinner with Andre"" that focuses on a conversation but yet, becomes so witty and hilarious that you can't help but appreciate the film.The same goes for ""Carnage"".  While I have not seen the play, what I enjoyed about this film is how these four talents were able to transform their characters from civilized parents discussing their children to this breakdown of their characters as all gloves are off and the worst comes out of their mouths not just against the other parents, but couples start to fight each other.  It becomes wife vs. husband, wife vs. wife, husband vs. husband, wives against the husbands, it's just amazing how these adults lose control and I found the whole exchange quite hysterical.While a short film compared to other Roman Polanski films, as always with Polanski, it's attention to detail and subtlety and the way he was able to showcase the talent is amazing.  And you can't go wrong when you have Academy Award winning talent cast in your film.  I enjoyed the performances by Jodie Foster, Kate Winslet, Christoph Waltz and John C. Reilly but I just have to say that Jodie Foster in this film was absolutely fantastic!When you literally can see and feel the anger coming off Foster's character, it feels real, it looks real.  Her performance was amazing and I have no doubt that the other talents fed from that.  Not only did Foster deliver, you can see the anger in her face, the tension in her skin, the veins literally about to pop out, her performance was absolutely amazing!If anything, I was more curious about John C. Reilly as he was cast opposite of Foster. At first I thought that the chemistry was good, but then when you find out that the two traveled through Africa, the credibility of the two as a couple felt a bit off.  Nevertheless, the actor also held his own and also brought a more calming effect towards the beginning of this film.  Also, his role required a little bit more action of having to clean up the vomit and having to use the hairdryer quite a bit.And speaking of vomit, for those with a low-tolerance to films that showcase vomit, I just want to warn you right now that you're going to see some vomit chunks in this film.As for the DVD release, you get a hilarious Q&A; segment with John C. Reilly and Christoph Waltz, plus the talent talking about their characters and also seeing them on the red carpet.  As mentioned, for those who want better PQ and AQ, definitely go for the Blu-ray release but as for the DVD is concerned, the film looks and sounds very good on DVD and because most of the entire film is shot inside a living room and the film relies on character performance, some may feel that the DVD will be good enough.As for the film's title, ""Carnage"", it has to do with the incident involving the children.  Jodie Foster as Penelope Longstreet rejects violence and wants civility, while Alan Cowan believes that his son and the use of physical force is part of humanity.  To see this mental breakdown among civilized people.For example, Penelope is the writer who has covered Africa.  In the beginning, she is civil but once her beloved books have vomit all over them, we start to see her change.  We also see her change and side with Nancy Cowan on Michael's treatment of the hamster.  We saw Michael being the calm one of the bunch but when his wife starts to unleash her anger towards him, we realize this conversation between these four adults is going nowhere.  But for the audience, it's the intensity of their exchange, the escalation of the verbal assaults that become quite hysterical and amusing.""Carnage"" is a film that captivates you through escalating verbal assaults that lead to a chaotic disintegrating meeting between four adults who discuss their children's incident.  While I have heard that the play has much more than the film adaptation, on its own, you can't help but be amused by the wonderful performances by the talents.  Was it perfect?  Not at all, but the film does work and you can't help but laugh at what you see happening before your eyes.  I found it absolutely amusing.But of course, for some cinema fans, Roman Polanski taking on a dark comedy such as this, may seem like a step backwards or not in par compared to other films in his oeuvre.  It may not be one of his more memorable films but I do applause Roman Polanski trying something different.Overall, ""Carnage"" is a film that is full of intense emotion and yet, I found this film to be quite captivating and enjoyable.

Roman Polanski's ""Carnage"" is a black comedy which plays out like a wicked game of charades:  what you see isn't going to be close to what you'll get.  The movie begins innocently enough with two sets of parents meeting to ""discuss"" an altercation on the playground between their two boys.  As things progress, there's nothing but carnage left.Jodie Foster is simply fantastic as the high-strung wife of milquetoast John C. Reilly, who simply tries to be ""every man"" and get along with everyone.  As the movie unfolds, though, you'll see Reilly isn't the nice guy he appears to be.  Kate Winslet is also superb as a wife who has held her tongue way too long when it comes to her lawyer husband, played by Christoph Waltz.  As their discussion progresses, each one is stripped of their facade.  Throw in some excellent Scotch and you know the ugly truth will come out.  The viewer finds out these couples' children are the LEAST of their worries.Based on the play ""God of Carnage,"" by Yasmina Rezas, Polanski manages to keep the film (that is basically four people talking) moving a very fast-paced clip.  He had to--you won't find any high-speed chases here, and the only explosions in this film are the verbal bombs between the parents.  There are many laugh out-loud moments seeing these four trying to hold it together and remain civil, when all they really want to do is probably punch each other.

1519121,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B006QVRUS2,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[0, 0]","Based on a stage play, CARNAGE shows two sets of parents (Jodie Foster, John C. Reilly, Kate Winslet, Christoph Waltz) coming together for a cordial meeting after their sons have been involved in a fight.  However that atmosphere of cordiality soon dissipates, as the four of them become involved in a series of arguments, both verbal and physical.  Roman Polanski's film has strong echoes of Mike Nichols' WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF; it is a four-character study of bad behavior, only this time all the protagonists give as good as they get - unlike the Nichols film, where George Segal and Sandy Dennis function as the butts for Burton and Taylor's verbal jousts.  CARNAGE is both horrifying yet blackly funny, as we marvel at the depths to which four supposedly civilized middle-class people can sink to in order to retain their self-esteem.  The only character who seems rather out of place is Foster's Penelope Longstreet, chiefly because the actor does not seem to understand the absurdities of her role.  The film is shot almost entirely in one set, showing how the characters are enclosed in a claustrophobic world of their own making.

1519124,A328S9RN3U5M68,B006QVRUS2,Grady Harp,"[2, 2]","CARNAGE the award winning play by Yasmina Reza called variously `Le Dieu du carnage' or Gods of Carnage that did so well on Broadway and on tour (with more interesting casts) becomes (literally) `Carnage' in Roman Polanski's (and Yamina Reza's) adaptation for the screen.  It is more a revelation of human misbehavior than of comedy - unless the viewer finds a hour and fifteen minutes of seething loathing and bitterness funny.  The cast is a group of strong actors and should be able to makes this story work, but for some viewers it will be a frustrating waste of time.The plot has been summarized well: `In Brooklyn Bridge Park, eleven year old Zachary Cowan strikes his eleven year old classmate Ethan Longstreet across the face with a stick after an argument. Among the more serious of Ethan's injuries is a permanently missing tooth and the possibility of a second tooth also being lost. Their respective parents learn of the altercation through Ethan's parents questioning him about his injuries. The Longstreet parents invite the Cowan parents to their Brooklyn apartment to deal with the incident in a civilized manner. They are: Penelope Longstreet (Jodie Foster), whose idea it was to invite the Cowans, she whose priorities in life include human rights and justice; Michael Longstreet (John C. Riley), who tries to be as accommodating as possible to retain civility in any situation; Nancy Cowan (Kate Winslet), a nervous and emotionally stressed woman; and Alan Cowan (Christoph Waltz), who is married more to his work as evidenced by the attachment he has to his cell phone and taking work calls at the most inopportune times.' The one room (except for a bathroom and hallway) setting becomes more claustrophobic as the film presses on, making the childhood misbehavior of the incident between the two boys pale in comparison to the ruthless adult conflagration that results.  The dialogue is snappy, there is the requisite vomiting episode that seems to be a part of every film made these days, references to animal abuse, the repugnant misuse of cellphones, and the seemingly endless arguing becomes thuddingly dull by the end of the film.With so many truly fine, sensitive films available to watch, CARNAGE becomes its title.

1519129,A1AQBOWEL8TROJ,B006QVRUS2,Jean-ren Leroux,"[1, 2]","Polanski is very good with stories that start simple and slowly get out of hands. I can see why he felt at home with this. The construction of this film is fascinating and, of course, the acting is enticing. Although, I must say, John C. Reilly is the best of all four. In my humble opinion, of course. All the other ones, as good as they are (and they are), seemed to exaggerate a tad too much whenever losing it. It felt a bit like acting. John C. Reilly, on the other hand, was always believable even when angry. Especially when angry. As an actor, he really held his own amongst the three other powerhouse names. That's all to his credit.Now the intentions of the storytellers are what got me a bit annoyed. First, I didn't think we needed to have ""help"" in order to not like Christoph Waltz's character in the beginning. Why put him constantly on the phone? Of course we're going to be angry at him. The two couples have plenty enough of irritants between each other. We don't need to have the writers voluntarily create bad habits for them. Like the photos of Jodie Foster's characters. She obviously loves them more than certain human beings. Or Kate Winslet's character vomiting in the living room. They should let their personalities run the show and not use artificial artifacts to help us feel whatever they want us to feel as viewers. Speaking of the Jodie Foster's character, I feel like this whole debacle is, in most part, her fault. By constantly pushing the envelope, by constantly wanting to lecture the other couples, she finally provokes them. Her character and Christoph Waltz's character are the pillars of this story. They're both symptomatic of two important breed of parents.But the conclusion is too simple for my taste. To finish by saying that kids are basically more ""sane"" than adults, especially parents, is not fair. Even a cheap shot. Kids are not as conscious and ""aware"" of  their behavior. They go with the flow whereas adults are ""corrupted"" by their life experiences and whatever pressure society puts on them, good and bad. The conclusion solves nothing.

Since this is just one step shy of filming a stage play with a single scene (the living room), the importance of these isn't quite what it is with action films.This is a very, very different film. It's like some of the stage play adaptations from the 1950's and early 1960's. In stage plays, dialog and its delivery is just about everything as action is limited by the confines of a theatrical stage. That's the case with this film.""Carnage"" is so reminiscent of ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" it can be characterized as an updated reprise of the concept. Watching it is akin to watching a horrifying train wreck in mid-wreck, for 75 minutes in a slow motion replay loop. It was outright uncomfortable after the first 15 minutes with the tension for the following hour so thick I wanted to find an exit to escape the rapidly rising feelings of claustrophobia.I believe that's exactly what the screenwriter and Roman Polanski intended, and therefore they and the film succeed. I also believe it's why ""Carnage"" has over a dozen 1-star reviews with comments about acting being over the top. I've no doubt a good number of them felt the same tense, confining discomfort and didn't realize it's exactly the emotional response that was intended. Thus, nearly all viewers will either love or hate this film with very little ambivalence. If you feel uncomfortable, wishing you could escape by about 15-20 minutes into it, that's how you're supposed to feel.

1519131,AQLZFWVUC7SQF,B006QVRUS2,John C,"[0, 0]","This film was hardly shown anywhere because of its limited appeal as a talky movie based on a play and also maybe due to Roman Polanski's reputation and fugitive status. I can't recall if it played near me. 'Carnage' was a commercial failure costing a surprisingly $25 million to make where you don't see the money up on the screen since it was filmed basically on one set and used only four actors unless most of the budget was spent on hiring three Oscar-winning actors (Two possess two Oscars so maybe they were  paid twice as much?) and a production designer and a director who were also honored with those statuettes. These people earned whatever they were paid because the film redeemed itself as a critical success, the more important judgement for me. I don't know how the film compares to the French play which was a hit around the world. Yasmina Reza's play and the film she co-scripted with Polanski are sometimes listed as a comedy but more like a black one at best. The disc's cover calls it 'A Biting Comedy of No Manners' and that's a reasonable accessment of the story as a dark, modern day comedy of manners (hence the pun using ""No"") so don't expect to see a funny haha one.The plot consists of two couples getting together over one couple's child injuring the child of the other pair. What starts as a peaceful discussion soon balloons into battles a la 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.'  There are two other conflicts in the story (No spoilers here if you haven't seen this film). that are resolved during the wordless conclusion, but the main one with the parents ends too abruptly or doesn't really end, depending on your point of view, which might have been the filmmakers' intent to keep you guessing about the outcome. However the two resolved conflicts somehow bring closure to the main one when you think about it.....Good performances by Jodie Foster, Kate Winslett, Christoph Waltz, and John C. Reilly keep their arguments barreling along.  Polanski knows how to make the most of the story set mainly in a NYC apartment where its cramped setting fuels the quartet's escalating rounds of accusations, recriminations, insults, and prejudices. Under the characters' civilized facade lurk pent up frustration, resentment, and anger that surface and spiral out of control when further fueled by good scotch, thus exposing their dirty laundry to each other and we sorry spectators.This Blu-ray has excellent video quality. Don't expect anything spectacular with surround sound effects as there's hardly any opportunity in this kind of non-action film. Dialogue is crisp and clear which is what counts here, and Alexandre Desplat's sparse musical score never interferes with it as the actors' histrionics make their own kind of music, mostly harsh and unsoothing. Unfortunately there's no commentary by Polanski or anyone but the extras with the cast almost make up for it, especially the one where Waltz and Reilly discuss the making of the film and their careers. Basically 'Carnage' is canned theater but it's an engrossing evening for a willing audience as Polanski respects his film's stage bound origins.

1519134,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B006QVRUS2,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[8, 13]","A boy, carrying (or was it armed?) with a stick, assaults another boy in a park. This prompts their parents to convene in a New York apartment to discuss the incident in Carnage, the latest effort from director Roman Polanski. Based on the acclaimed play God of Carnage by Yasmina Reza and adapted for the screen by Reza and Polanski, this 76-minute film takes place entirely in a single apartment, mostly in one room, and consists of only four actors. It's certainly a radical departure from Polanski's previous filmThe Ghost Writer, still one of the most underrated films of 2010.This pitch-black comedy is one of the most surprising films of 2011 because of how tremendously it succeeds in a cinematic setting, avoiding the overwrought tedium that could have accompanied a film with only one set and a small group of actors. Translating a difficult story with stage origins to the screen is not new territory for Polanski, whose three-man showDeath and the Maidenwas also based on a play and managed to be both intense and entertaining. Even so, I was ill prepared for just how impressive Carnage would ultimately be.Alan and Nancy (Christoph Waltz and Kate Winslet) arrive at the New York apartment of Michael and Penelope (John C. Reilly and Jodie Foster) with the intention of casually discussing the incident between their children. It's immediately clear that no one feels comfortable, with all four seemingly teetering dangerously close to the edge, ready to burst at any moment. Alan, an attorney, is constantly on his cellphone and the incessant bickering between the two couples only grows more incessant as the evening goes on. With the faade of maturity wearing thin and the conversations growing increasingly awkward, Alan and Nancy attempt to leave, but something always brings them back in. The film begins with these characters on edge and slowly pushes them off. Soon, characters are vomiting and what begins as a simple meeting over children descends into trivial arguments, drunken tirades, and increasingly childish behavior.Miraculously, this is all fascinating to watch. All dialogue, the film never slows down due to the fast, furious banter. It's based on a play but this adaptation is a masterwork of screenwriting. The structure is tight, the pacing perfect, and it glows with wit and cynicism. When action films can lull audiences to sleep, it takes a special kind of brilliance to write four characters talking non-stop in such a way that puts the audience on the edge of their seat. Too often I'll see a film that can't separate itself from its own stage origins. Carnage, in theory, is so obviously based on a theatrical production, confined entirely to a single apartment with such a small cast and yet it feels right seeing this drama unfold on screen. Polanski is a graceful director with the ability to make great films, entertaining films, and great, entertaining films. He keeps things moving quickly without choppy editing or spastic camera movement. He allows his shot to linger for just the right amount of time before moving on and makes things claustrophobic without suffocating the audience. It's rare that a film moves so quickly without appearing to be in any sort of hurry.Polanski has nabbed quite the cast, with three Academy Award winners and an Academy Award nominee assuming the main roles. Carnage can only be as good as the actors that bring it to life and everyone delivers. The film is very funny and the script has its fair share of wit, but the humor onscreen comes not from written lines but the way the characters cope with their increasing frustration. The real biting humor comes from the slow disintegration of each character's faade and each actor gives an award-worthy performance in illustrating this breakdown. These performances show that a subtle impending implosion can often be more captivating and suspenseful on film than any extravagant, CGI explosion. All four play very different characters in vastly different ways, with the majority of positive attention going to Winslet and Foster. Both veterans of their craft, Foster gives the more subtle performance of a woman under pressure and about to explode, while Winslet is more extroverted as a woman under pressure and about to vomit.If I had to award a single cast member it would be Waltz, an unceasingly hypnotic actor with a slightly dangerous air. He fashions a snake-like performance that fixates your eyes to the screen. His performance is more of a balance of internal and external than anyone and his venomous way of saying condescending lines of dialogue is unmatched.The weakest link in the cast is John C. Reilly, slowly easing back into the dramatic roles that established him. While he's more well-known now for his comedic performances, he's a very talented dramatic actor who just seems overwhelmed here. In another movie, it wouldn't be too noticeable but his delivery and the way he carries himself here isn't as assured as the actors he's surrounded by.Carnage seizes you immediately and glides through its brisk running time. Never does it wear out its welcome and when it ends, I was still ready for more. It's one of the best screenplays of the year, brought to life exquisitely by one of the world's greatest filmmakers. Polanski doesn't have a specific style, which allows him to bring something different to every film he makes. He's a master of the filmmaking medium, able to make a compelling film in any genre.  Could any director put out two films in a row more different from each other in story, tone, and execution than this and The Ghost Writer?I don't know how well this will hold up on repeat viewings, but I was floored by Carnage. I expected to enjoy it, but I didn't expect how giddily I would proclaim it to be one of my favorite films of the year. Set aside any reservations you may have about the film's ability to entertain or captivate and see it, or risk missing some of the best performances in 2011 in one of 2011's best films.GRADE: A",5,One

1519135,ANDD6PADWE475,B006QVRUS2,JoyC,"[0, 1]","Tis true, this movie is neither for those in search of a light diversion, nor is it inspiring, nor intriguing to those who do not find human nature so.  Nor is it exciting in other than a mesmerizing, ironically comical manner.  If you seek in a movie any of those qualities, this will not be your cup of tea.  Don't beat yourself up.  Social satire, like revenge, is a dish best served cold.  In other words, should you desire to sample this fare, go into it with a clear head and your eyes open.On the other hand, there may be those among us who might find it fascinating to watch, undetected, as four people with the best of intentions behave outrageously.  If so, this is your wicked, dark cup of espresso.  How can four parents, so determined to arrive at a consensual conclusion to a touchy matter of offspring misbehavior, leap so badly off track in a matter of minutes?  Simply confine them in a room, and allow them to be their most earnest, self absorbed, selves.  They are as above-average in their own estimation as any human being.  They (parents of ""perpetrator"") are ""...very touched by how generous you're being.  We realize how you're trying to smooth things over.""  (Parents of ""victim"":) ""Please...it's the least we can do....(a few seconds later)...But he realizes he disfigured his schoolmate?""  With regards to the boy's tooth, ""...apparently the nerve is not completely exposed...part of it is exposed...""  Ah.  Yes, that seems to be the problem.""We're born alone, and we die alone, that's it.""  Still, it can't hurt to sample a bit of top drawer single malt, can it?And there you have it.  Escalation ensues.  Nerves pertaining to parenting styles, culture, global values, marriage, child rearing, the treatment of a hamster, etc, etc, become completely exposed.  Scream, sob, rant, pummel, throw things, toss your cobbler if you must, but do not--I repeat, DO NOT--leave!Perhaps because it lacked the lightheartedness of many a farce,  the plot felt a bit contrived due to chronic incorrigibility and the ""not leaving"".  (It was a completely dysfunctional ""Minnesota Goodbye"".  Google it if you must.) Despite that, one of the more enjoyable aspects was the fun the actors seemed to be having underneath it all.  This was the most evident in Reilley and Waltz.  Winslet was very subtle with it, but Foster was a bit strained and intense for it to be quite as deliciously evil.  Maybe a bit more ebb and flow would have evened it out a bit in her case.  That said, all the portrayals were quite excellent in rising to the task of carrying the play to film.  It is simply well acted and directed.""Look, we're all decent people, all four of us.  I don't know how we got so carried away losing our tempers.  It's totally unnecessary!""""Stop it, Michael!  Stop...mediating!""We may find ourselves guffawing, horrified, wanting to slap the participants, unconsciously egging them on, or all the above.

1519137,A3KDVSFMPMXSRO,B006QVRUS2,Kevin F. Tasker,"[1, 2]","Carnage begins with semantics. ""Armed with a stick"" vs. ""Carrying a stick."" From here, it gradually builds into brutality. Four parents in one room, during one long school day. The film is a deconstruction of the shell of upper-class Americanism. Everything is icy and detached, down to the serving of the cobbler. No one wants to fight at first. One character is only interested in taking his business calls, snorting and giggling as everyone waits, rapt, unsettled, for him to finish. Then, slowly, allegiances falter and are reassigned. Venom begins to course and flow. Each actor in the film is stellar, particularly relative newcomer Christoph Waltz and the ever-ravishing Kate Winslet. Jodi Foster is effectively nonplussed and John C. Reilly plays his affable slow-man to a point and then tips over into madness (reminded me a little of Richard Burton in Albee's landmark Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf). The film suffers from contrivances. It takes a lot to believe that these people stay in the room together as long as they do. The attempts at keeping them together (oh, we forgot to have coffee! Oh, we forgot to have a drink!) just don't seem believable. After an episode of vomiting and rage, most normal humans would be out the door, down the elevator, and way far away. Nevertheless, everyone sticks around long enough to get trashed and expose one another as smug, accountable heathens. Polanski, working from source material some decade or so old, manages to keep things feeling fresh and Post-9/11 paranoid. His direction is understated, allowing the actors to provide all the intrigue, cringes, and so forth. The film is sticky and high-brow, packed with wit and vinegar. The last shot of an idyllic pastoral landscape is superb, juxtaposed as it is after so much nebulous verbal-warfare. Carnage never reaches its potential, however, do to its cramped setting and the limitations therein. Must have been a marvelous time at the theater.

I think he has a reputation that exceeds his personality. I don't think he has much of one. I think he's an old perverted creep who just happens to make completely glorious films, and the same goes for Roman Polanski. His new film ""Carnage"", based on a film set in New York City, had to be shot in Paris, because Polanski was literally not allowed in the United States, due to a fugitive status, due to a trial that I'm sure we're all familiar with.A few years ago, a friend offered me an extra ticket to a play called ""God of Carnage"" by someone named Yasmina Reza, and this play was a glorious thing. It lasted about 75 minutes, with no intermission, obviously. It is set around two sets of parents, whose children have a fight, and decide to meet one another to discuss this matter in a calm, civilized, polite and direct way, and end up showing their true colors, which in this case means nearly killing each other on account of different beliefs, values, a food-poisoning inducing cobbler, an ill-fated hamster, a husband who is on his cell phone too often, among many other things which build to, well, carnage.One thing I am happy to say is that the film version of ""Carnage"" is exactly like the play. It has one low-key set, and a fast, exciting screenplay that doesn't waste a single minute of its short (79 mins) running time. We never meet the children who the film revolves around, but we don't really need to, as the story at its heart, is not about the kids. It features fantastic performances by all four of its lead actors, Kate Winslet and Jodie Foster in particular. The guys (John C. Reilly and Christoph Waltz) do good jobs too, but the ladies really shine in this one, having decidedly better-developed characters than the men.It's also pretty interesting what the movie suggests. It ends up proving that the children can patch things up and get over their differences, but the parents (the adults) cannot. The film, like the play, has no real ending, as the Winslet/Waltz couple leaves the home of the Foster/Reilly couple, nothing having been resolved. It says something about how children can often be more grown up and mature than their parents, who have never quite developed coping skills, and refuse to deal with people who don't share the same values and opinions as they do.Kate Winslet and Jodie Foster, having started out their careers as theater actresses, shine brightly in a picture like this, which requires a tremendously theatrical acting style, assuring that those in the cheap seats in the back feel the same impact as those who shelled out for the expensive ones. The film is, in general, loud, brash, biting, and extremely funny. You feel as if Polanski has trapped his characters in this room, forcing them to duke it out, in this battle of wits, with one another, although they could literally leave at any time. I hate Polanski, as a person, but he couldn't have done the movie any better. While this film could have been sitcommy and unrealistic, it manages to be the exact opposite.

1519147,AYBL30P5NXNZ4,B006QVRUS2,"Mr. Stephen Kennedy ""skenn1701a""","[1, 1]","Roman Polanski has gathered a brilliant cast, with a terrific concept, and yet produced what I think is probably one of his lesser films.. simultaneously feeling somewhat long (at only 79 minutes!) and yet not long enough to reach a more biting, effective and satisfying conclusion.The movie takes place in one room, as two couples (from apparently reasonably wealthy backgrounds) meet to discuss an altercation between their sons, which resulted in missing teeth for one of them, after being hit in the face with a stick by the other.  It all starts with a great show of civility, as they each go to great lengths to remind each other that they are above such petty squabbles and as adults can reach a conclusion amicably.  However as time goes on (in real time) the restraint and cloak of civility worn by the characters slips away, and by the end we see the real gap between what they would like to be seen as, and what actually lies beneath.  The turning point comes half way through when the stress (or the cobbler..?) causes one to throw up, and this acts as a catalyst for the underlying true selves to be seen, almost as if the repression had the cork removed.It is actually a wonderful concept, at least for those that like their `action' purely drive by people talking in a room.  However, although this was always going to be tough to make into a film, it's disappointing that Polanski has somehow accentuated the staginess of the play, rather than made the situation any more natural or at least cinematic.  This does distance you somewhat from the events taking place.  On the other hand, the performances from Winslet, Foster, Reilly and Waltz are all excellent.  They appear to be having a ball, getting their teeth into a role which allows the full range of emotion in a short space of time, perhaps too much so in some cases as they let their acting tics start to show and flag the characters coming development.  In the hands of these great actors though, we relish watching as the relationships develop from 4 people trying to agree, to two couples facing off against each other, disintegrating as alliances form and then fall apart between the various characters (with the aid of whisky and cigars), until each stands apart.So although stagey, its meticulously put together and well acted.  Why only 3 stars? - because the sum of its parts, what it adds up to, is somehow at the end of the movie not quite enough to resonate as much as it could or should have, failing to surprise in a way which would have left its mark in the same way as, for example,An Inspector Calls [Region 2], orWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

It doesn't really resemble anything Polanski has done previously.However, I think it works.  Polanski has always been interested in human nature, particularly the darker side of it-- the side that people don't openly acknowledge.  So the notion of four people scrapping it out in a flat like rats in a cage, I think, must have had a certain mordant fascination for the filmmaker.People who found it boring should consider the preparation and precision of timing and camerawork that this kind of drama requires.  It's really kind of exhilarating to see the characters/actors sizing each other up in the beginning, and progressing to flurries of jabs, punches and odd protective alliances.  It's like watching a prize fight, or maybe tag team wrestling in the lower moments.  Jodie Foster was brave to take a role that satirizes the politically correct, since many have hung that label around her neck as an actress/celebrity.The current state of America is on display here, too, because the play/movie has undercurrents of class warfare, bullying in the schoolyard, snobbery, and corporate manipulation and indifference.I'm not sure if Polanski is standing to the side and giving America a one-fingered salute.

A drama where two kids parents meet at ones apartment to decide ""how to handle"" the situation where one of the boys hit another boy with a stick, knocking out teeth. Who's fault was it? Who should apologize to whom? Should the parents get involved? Should they also take responsibility for their kids aggression and the others timidness? We learn the issue of aggression and short comings might be more so with the parents, than with the kids. And that poor hamster? A film by Roman Polanski, more so a short dinner theater type play brought to film. The shortest film I've seen in a theater. 1 hr 15 min. But great stars, fun plot. Things go from simple casual attempt(s) between two sets of parents with coming to an agreement concerning responsibility for their kids actions, to the parents engaged in something close to total WWIII. With a little apple cobbler tossed in (and up) along with way, plus way too many social cocktails in the mix. And a busy cell phone adding to the never ending comedy-drama.With stars this wonderful, this film is a must see hit. And again... that poor hamster.There are great court room dramas that keep you engaged. This is not a court room drama, but equal to such as a social drama between agreeing/disagreeing, then agreeing then back to disagreeing sets of parents.With everyone carrying, then unloading, a lot of psychological baggage.And YOU are the fly on the wall.Great!

Before long, one boy is grounded and another one nearly looses his tooth.  Surely, these young people need to be punished and thought a lesson; so - their parents decide to meet and assess what to do next.The entire movie is entirely set in a NYC apartment of one of the couples.  It starts as civil and cordial meeting between two pairs of concerned parents and turns into, well - carnage.  In nearly two hours, we see these four people fighting it out with each other in words.  It starts as one pair of parents against the other, but then lines become blurry as aliences between them start to shift.  Every now and then, pairs would re-group, but then things would fall into a chaos again.  It is witty, contemporary story about modern life, alienation between people, parents and their children; greed, glutony, assessment of our priorities and purpose in middle life.

1519161,A1DUT6O3BWXEJ,B006QVRUS2,"Shawn Gordon ""gordy the ghoul""","[1, 1]","It all started with a school yard quarrel between their eleven year-old sons. Penelope and Michael are the parents of the victim, as they call it, and Alan and  Nancy are those of the ""criminal"", which is also how they put it. They gather at Michael and Penelope's upper-middleclass apartment to discuss a resolution and perhaps warranted discipline, but this isn't really about the kids, the crime, the victim or the criminal. It is about their parents and how civility is just a faade awaiting to be unmasked, or the god of carnage being unleashed.Roman Polanski's movie Carnage isn't much more than one long, fascinating discussion that turns into a fight and then a battle of wills as perpetrated by four fine actors, giving four wonderful performances.Those actors are Christoph Waltz and Kate Winslet as Alan and Nancy Cowan and Jodie Foster and John C. Reilly as Penelope and Michael Longstreet. They are all pitch perfect in these roles, they are also immensely watchable actors, being the whole show isn't a hamper on the surroundings as much as it's a blessing having everything else get out of way of these superb performers.Also there is a first rate screenplay provided by Yasmina Reza, based on  her play ""God of Carnage"".  Filled with clever and wonderfully witty dialogue, smart retorts and an endless  barrage of one up manships that could happily resonate on the lips of the Monty Python troupe or a more modern Marx Brothers.Polanski, one of the truly great filmmaker's still operating today, seems to have had a major reassurance of ability in the last decade or so, whenever the Pianist came out and just after the Ninth Gate. Polanski resists doing much with the surrounding are here, he never once attempts to ""open up"" the staginess in Carnage, this show belongs to his talent cast and anything that could stand in there way has been alimented. So why essentially film a play, well so a lot of people like me can experience Foster, Waltz, Winslet and Reilly wonderful  in these roles.Given the subject matter and the claustrophobic environment Carnage wisely doesn't stick around longer than it should, at only 79 minutes including credits, it doesn't get a change to wear out it's welcome. A minor movie in the oeuvre of Polanski's perhaps, but one that is well worth watching.see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",4,hilarious battle of (nit)wits,1362355200,"03 4, 2013",2013,2341,"['started', 'school', 'yard', 'quarrel', 'eleven', 'year-old', 'sons', 'Penelope', 'Michael', 'are', 'parents', 'victim', 'call', 'Alan', 'Nancy', 'are', 'criminal', 'also', 'how', 'put', 'gather', 'Michael', 'Penelope', 'upper-middleclass', 'apartment', 'discuss', 'resolution', 'perhaps', 'warranted', 'discipline', ""n't"", 'really', 'kids', 'crime', 'victim', 'criminal', 'parents', 'how', 'civility', 'just', 'faade', 'awaiting', 'be', 'unmasked', 'god', 'carnage', 'being', 'unleashed.Roman', 'Polanski', 'movie', 'Carnage', ""n't"", 'much', 'more', 'one', 'long', 'fascinating', 'discussion', 'fight', 'then', 'battle', 'wills', 'perpetrated', 'four', 'fine', 'actors', 'giving', 'four', 'wonderful', 'performances.Those', 'actors', 'are', 'Christoph', 'Waltz', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Alan', 'Nancy', 'Cowan', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'Penelope', 'Michael', 'Longstreet', 'are', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'roles', 'are', 'also', 'immensely', 'watchable', 'actors', 'being', 'whole', 'show', ""n't"", 'hamper', 'surroundings', 'as', 'much', 'blessing', 'having', 'everything', 'else', 'get', 'way', 'superb', 'performers.Also', 'first', 'rate', 'screenplay', 'provided', 'Yasmina', 'Reza', 'based', 'play', 'God', 'Carnage', 'Filled', 'clever', 'wonderfully', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'smart', 'retorts', 'endless', 'barrage', 'one', 'manships', 'could', 'happily', 'resonate', 'lips', 'Monty', 'Python', 'troupe', 'more', 'modern', 'Marx', 'Brothers.Polanski', 'one', 'truly', 'great', 'filmmaker', 'still', 'operating', 'today', 'have', 'had', 'major', 'reassurance', 'ability', 'last', 'decade', 'so', 'whenever', 'Pianist', 'came', 'out', 'just', 'Ninth', 'Gate', 'Polanski', 'doing', 'much', 'surrounding', 'are', 'here', 'never', 'once', 'attempts', 'open', 'up', 'staginess', 'Carnage', 'show', 'talent', 'cast', 'anything', 'could', 'stand', 'way', 'been', 'alimented', 'So', 'why', 'essentially', 'film', 'play', 'well', 'so', 'lot', 'people', 'can', 'experience', 'Foster', 'Waltz', 'Winslet', 'Reilly', 'wonderful', 'roles.Given', 'subject', 'matter', 'claustrophobic', 'environment', 'Carnage', 'wisely', ""n't"", 'stick', 'around', 'longer', 'should', 'only', '79', 'minutes', 'including', 'credits', ""n't"", 'get', 'change', 'wear', 'out', 'welcome', 'minor', 'movie', 'oeuvre', 'Polanski', 'perhaps', 'one', 'well', 'worth', 'watching.see', 'reviews', 'moviezonemagazine.com']",Carnage
1519162,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B006QVRUS2,Sheryl Fechter,"[14, 16]","""Carnage"" opens like a play which it was adapted from and is tautly directed by Roman Polanski.  Penelope Longstreet (Jodie Foster) along with husband Michael (John C. Reilly) invite the Cowans to their apartment; Nancy (Kate Winslet) and her work-consumed husband, Christoph Waltz.  The Longstreets feel it necessary to discuss the reason why their ""victim"" son was struck, and badly hurt, by the ""maniac brutalizer"" Cowan's son.  Michael would simply appreciate an apology from their child, although Penelope seems to have her own agenda and intends to push it.Penelope and Nancy have a tremendous amount of tension between them which is palpable from the onset.  Michael appears personable, overly generous and friendly ... at first.  On the other hand,  Mr. Cowan is aloof to the subject, on the cell phone constantly as a pharmaceutical lawyer who is much more absent in the genesis of the conversation.The 'go-around' all plays out in one room, the living room, as you can sense the air suck right out of the place. It becomes almost claustrophobic, in feel, as the couples begin wildly talking, accusing, and definitely getting far off the subject of their sons.  In this obvious stress inducing situation, especially for Nancy and then Penelope, anxiety builds and the topics get verbally and emotionally out of control.  The discussion of the children's situation is quickly set aside while personal marital issues insidiously invade the conversation.  More like spouting-offs!The husbands slowly get involved by first defending their wives, arguing with each other, and then challenging each other.  The Scotch then comes out on the scene as they now decide it would be a great time to take a vintage bottle out for a ride.  Nancy demands a drink for her self while defending Penelope, then challenges a reluctant Michael to pour his wife some also.  Alliances are formed and broken then reattached almost as fast as the mercurial, rapid-fire dialogue. The words are shot between them as caustic arrows and hit just as harshly.  The husbands start to turn on their wives while getting highly frustrated; ""You think too much...women think too much"" and ""Yes, I feel like being completely despicable"".The talking and arguing becomes amazingly ludicrous in this verbal smack-down.  All four actors are on top of their game in the film.  This tightly wound, inflammatory, and hilarious study is actually very human, as one topic is flying into another then back again.At the very end of the film, right before the credits roll, there is one of the best scenes for tying-up all the loose ends and also a good shot in the arm of laughter for myself.  It does put seemingly huge things in perspective in a very scant amount of time.",5,"""You Murdered A Hamster"" - Nancy Cowan",1332720000,"03 26, 2012",2012,2735,"['Carnage', 'play', 'was', 'adapted', 'tautly', 'directed', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'Penelope', 'Longstreet', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'husband', 'Michael', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'invite', 'Cowans', 'apartment', 'Nancy', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'work-consumed', 'husband', 'Christoph', 'Waltz', 'Longstreets', 'feel', 'necessary', 'discuss', 'reason', 'why', 'victim', 'son', 'was', 'struck', 'badly', 'hurt', 'maniac', 'brutalizer', 'Cowan', 'son', 'Michael', 'would', 'simply', 'appreciate', 'apology', 'child', 'Penelope', 'have', 'own', 'agenda', 'push', 'it.Penelope', 'Nancy', 'have', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'tension', 'palpable', 'onset', 'Michael', 'personable', 'overly', 'generous', 'friendly', 'first', 'other', 'hand', 'Mr.', 'Cowan', 'aloof', 'subject', 'cell', 'phone', 'constantly', 'pharmaceutical', 'lawyer', 'who', 'much', 'more', 'absent', 'genesis', 'conversation.The', ""'go-around"", 'plays', 'out', 'one', 'room', 'living', 'room', 'can', 'sense', 'air', 'suck', 'right', 'place', 'almost', 'claustrophobic', 'feel', 'couples', 'begin', 'wildly', 'talking', 'accusing', 'definitely', 'getting', 'far', 'subject', 'sons', 'obvious', 'stress', 'inducing', 'situation', 'especially', 'Nancy', 'then', 'Penelope', 'anxiety', 'builds', 'topics', 'get', 'verbally', 'emotionally', 'control', 'discussion', 'children', 'situation', 'quickly', 'set', 'aside', 'personal', 'marital', 'issues', 'insidiously', 'invade', 'conversation', 'More', 'spouting-offs', 'husbands', 'slowly', 'get', 'involved', 'first', 'defending', 'wives', 'arguing', 'other', 'then', 'challenging', 'other', 'Scotch', 'then', 'out', 'scene', 'now', 'decide', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'time', 'take', 'vintage', 'bottle', 'out', 'ride', 'Nancy', 'drink', 'self', 'defending', 'Penelope', 'then', 'reluctant', 'Michael', 'pour', 'wife', 'also', 'Alliances', 'are', 'formed', 'broken', 'then', 'reattached', 'almost', 'as', 'fast', 'mercurial', 'rapid-fire', 'dialogue', 'words', 'are', 'shot', 'caustic', 'arrows', 'hit', 'just', 'harshly', 'husbands', 'start', 'turn', 'wives', 'getting', 'highly', 'frustrated', 'think', 'too', 'much', 'women', 'think', 'too', 'much', 'Yes', 'feel', 'being', 'completely', 'despicable', '.The', 'talking', 'arguing', 'becomes', 'amazingly', 'ludicrous', 'verbal', 'smack-down', 'four', 'actors', 'are', 'top', 'game', 'film', 'tightly', 'wound', 'inflammatory', 'hilarious', 'study', 'actually', 'very', 'human', 'one', 'topic', 'flying', 'then', 'back', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'right', 'credits', 'roll', 'one', 'best', 'scenes', 'tying-up', 'loose', 'ends', 'also', 'good', 'shot', 'arm', 'laughter', 'put', 'seemingly', 'huge', 'things', 'perspective', 'very', 'scant', 'amount', 'time']",Carnage

1519164,A3P222CN9HAPTF,B006QVRUS2,"Steve Benner ""Stonegnome""","[2, 3]","""Carnage"" is an adaptation of Yasmina Reza's original stage play ""Le Dieu du carnage (God of Carnage)"" for the big screen, written and directed by Roman Polanski, in a translation from the original French by Michael Katims. Owing to Polanski's fugitive status in the USA, it was filmed (despite its Brooklyn setting) in Paris.The film makes excellent use of minimal set additions to the original stage production and the four cast members are all outstanding in their performances. The story itself is a comedy of manners, as two sets of parents to teenage boys meet in an attempt to resolve matters arising from a playground scrap between their respective sons.  The script explores the basis and boundaries of politeness versus honesty, social conscience versus self-interest and portrays the disastrous consequences of testing those boundaries. The excruciating shallow play-acting of social correctness is gradually replaced by the increasingly painful exposition of the truth as social hypocrisies are systematically dissected to display the selfish core.Throughout the film's 80-minute duration, allegiances and alliances shift, battle lines are drawn and redrawn, as prejudices, obsessions, fears and foibles are successively exposed, probed and ridiculed, emotions running high as opinions and values are successively attacked and defended; and the opening tensions are dissipated through farce.The script sticks closely to the original stage version, varying only in providing a neat storyline twist using the opening and closing title visuals, which poignantly shows up both the futility of the parents' attempts to resolve issues through their own ""grown-up and adult"" discussions, as well as the fact that all are equally at fault. The humour is subtle in its steps but hilarious in its cumulative effect. Those who know the play may be disappointed with Polanski's direction, which gives a less intimate but more claustrophobic feel to the enterprise. The film is nevertheless first rate and is heartily recommended.",5,Excruciatingly funny comedy of manners,1335225600,"04 24, 2012",2012,2029,"['Carnage', 'adaptation', 'Yasmina', 'Reza', 'original', 'stage', 'play', 'Le', 'Dieu', 'du', 'carnage', 'God', 'Carnage', 'big', 'screen', 'written', 'directed', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'translation', 'original', 'French', 'Michael', 'Katims', 'Owing', 'Polanski', 'fugitive', 'status', 'USA', 'was', 'filmed', 'Brooklyn', 'setting', 'Paris.The', 'film', 'excellent', 'use', 'minimal', 'set', 'additions', 'original', 'stage', 'production', 'four', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'story', 'comedy', 'manners', 'two', 'sets', 'parents', 'teenage', 'boys', 'meet', 'attempt', 'resolve', 'matters', 'arising', 'playground', 'scrap', 'respective', 'sons', 'script', 'basis', 'boundaries', 'politeness', 'versus', 'honesty', 'social', 'conscience', 'self-interest', 'disastrous', 'consequences', 'testing', 'boundaries', 'excruciating', 'shallow', 'play-acting', 'social', 'correctness', 'gradually', 'replaced', 'increasingly', 'painful', 'exposition', 'truth', 'social', 'hypocrisies', 'are', 'systematically', 'dissected', 'display', 'selfish', 'core.Throughout', 'film', '80-minute', 'duration', 'allegiances', 'alliances', 'shift', 'battle', 'lines', 'are', 'drawn', 'redrawn', 'prejudices', 'obsessions', 'fears', 'foibles', 'are', 'successively', 'exposed', 'probed', 'ridiculed', 'emotions', 'running', 'high', 'opinions', 'values', 'are', 'successively', 'attacked', 'defended', 'opening', 'tensions', 'are', 'dissipated', 'farce.The', 'script', 'sticks', 'closely', 'original', 'stage', 'version', 'varying', 'only', 'providing', 'neat', 'storyline', 'twist', 'using', 'opening', 'closing', 'title', 'visuals', 'poignantly', 'up', 'futility', 'parents', 'attempts', 'resolve', 'issues', 'own', 'grown-up', 'adult', 'discussions', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'are', 'equally', 'fault', 'humour', 'subtle', 'steps', 'hilarious', 'cumulative', 'effect', 'who', 'know', 'play', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Polanski', 'direction', 'less', 'intimate', 'more', 'claustrophobic', 'feel', 'enterprise', 'film', 'nevertheless', 'first', 'rate', 'heartily', 'recommended']",Carnage

Nancy and Allen (Kate Winslet and Christoph Waltz) are the parents of the culprit, and Penelope and Michael (Jodie Foster and John C. Reilly) are the piping mad parents of the injured victim.At some point, they decide to hold a meeting at the bourgeois home of the high-strung Penelope and her doltish husband, Michael. From the start, things begin to go awry. Penelope begins to critique the parenting skills of both Nancy and Allen, and visa versa. Before long, things get out of hand, with all four individuals firing various insults at one another, revealing their true colors, and ironically behaving like schoolyard bullies themselves. Much like Edward Albee's `Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf', alcohol soon plays a supporting role in the film, and the situation escalates from bad to worse.This is the film in a nutshell - pardon the clich&eacute;. Four people, one setting, tons of fireworks. It wants to be `Virginia Woolf' for a new generation, but lacks the acid wit and ferocious bite of Albee's masterpiece. One of the problems with `Carnage' is that the material isn't as funny as it thinks it is. These characters never go for the throat, and the film suffers as a result.Jodie Foster is yet another weak link in the film. She is over the top - and not in a good way. Her performance is annoyingly distracting. Either she was sorely miscast in this particular role, or comedy simply isn't Foster's forte. On the other hand, Kate Winslet, John C. Reilly, and Christoph Waltz are at the top of their game. Collectively, they make the film worth watching, and they have some of the best lines.`Carnage' isn't without its charms, though most of those are in the first act. The two scenes which bookend the film are quite effective as well. With just a bit more edge, this film could have been a small classic.

I have to start by saying that this is not a movie for everyone. It is just the four actors in an apartment talking. That said I do recommend this movie. The acting is fantastic (with 3 of 4 Oscar winners) and the movie is not slow moving at all. Both intelligent and funny, which seems hard to do these days the movie keeps you interested the entire time and waiting to see what happens next. There really isn't much more to say about a movie like this one, but if you liked ""Sunset Limited"" you will like this one too. Overall, a very good and funny movie that is not for everyone. I give it a B+.",4,Very funny and interesting movie dealing with parents after thier kids fight at school. I liked it but not for everyone.

1519171,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B006QVRUS2,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 2]","Meet the Longstreets and the Cowans, two married couples living in New York City. They are decent people (so they think), meeting in an apartment room to discuss a certain thing. Now that it is over and they seem satisfied, but what they don't know is that they are about to experience the worst of day of their life.The comedy opens with a long shot of schoolboys on the playground. It seems two of them get into a confrontation. Later, two pairs of parents hold a meeting to discuss the matter. They are Penelope Longstreet (Jodie Foster), Michael Longstreet (John C. Reilly), Nancy Cowan (Kate Winslet) and Alan Cowan (Christoph Waltz). When everything is done smoothly, one small thing leads to another, resulting in a mess.Based on a 2007 play ""Le Dieu du Carnage"" (""God of Carnage"") by Yasmina Reza, the film is almost entirely set in a Brooklyn apartment where the Longstreets live. In this French-German-Polish-Spanish production only four characters appear (except the director who is briefly seen as a neighbor behind the door).As you know, the idea of ""stage play on celluloid"" often fails, but Polanski keeps the brisk pace throughout, creating the tension between the characters. Polanski is always good at portraying people emotionally cornered in a claustrophobic situation (as shown in a psychological thriller ""Death and the Maiden""), but this time he effectively uses his technique for a more comedic purpose. It is a success though you might sometimes feel uncomfortable (even while laughing) because, after all, some aspects of ""Carnage,"" in an exaggerated manner, would remind us of the people we know including ourselves.Probably in real life, the Cowans would not stay so long in someone else's house. They would politely decline the leftover fruit cobbler offered to them and just go home.

Most likely dark humor covering all contemporary culture idols with vomit in literal as well as metaphorical sense covering all does come from the play, but Polanski surely did a great job of bringing all this to us in a crisp modern setting which makes every screen look like an art piece in itself, by placing every person and every single object in the exact place where it should be, by having selected exactly right actors, colors, sounds, everything.Reza's  misanthropic message (I'm sure it's there in the play) comes across forcefully in Polanski's rendering, and the film covers not just modern culture, but human relationships in general, including what we call ""fair"" competition in the industrial world, psychopathic industry captains, women whose life is all facade with no substance, parents who bring children in this world without really knowing what for and what they really want from life themselves...This film is considered black comedy, but I think this is too narrow a definition. It is black, to be sure, and yes, it's superbly sarcastic, but it's not a comedy, it's as deadly serious as life  ever can be.This movie can be seen as anti-American, but I think it's bigger than that, it's misanthropic in general, especially so considering that the world around us becomes more and more Americanized by the hour.",5,entertaining misanthropy,1330992000,"03 6, 2012",2012,1443,"['have', ""n't"", 'read', 'God', 'Carnage', 'Yasmina', 'Reza', 'think', 'Polanski', 'cinematography', '5', 'stars', 'Most', 'likely', 'dark', 'humor', 'covering', 'contemporary', 'culture', 'idols', 'vomit', 'literal', 'as', 'well', 'metaphorical', 'sense', 'covering', 'come', 'play', 'Polanski', 'surely', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'bringing', 'crisp', 'modern', 'setting', 'screen', 'look', 'art', 'piece', 'placing', 'person', 'single', 'object', 'exact', 'place', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'having', 'selected', 'exactly', 'right', 'actors', 'colors', 'sounds', 'everything.Reza', 'misanthropic', 'message', ""'m"", 'sure', 'there', 'play', 'forcefully', 'Polanski', 'rendering', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'modern', 'culture', 'human', 'relationships', 'general', 'including', 'what', 'call', 'fair', 'competition', 'industrial', 'world', 'psychopathic', 'industry', 'captains', 'women', 'life', 'facade', 'substance', 'parents', 'who', 'bring', 'children', 'world', 'really', 'knowing', 'what', 'what', 'really', 'want', 'life', 'film', 'considered', 'black', 'comedy', 'think', 'too', 'narrow', 'definition', 'black', 'be', 'sure', 'yes', 'superbly', 'sarcastic', 'not', 'comedy', 'as', 'deadly', 'serious', 'life', 'ever', 'can', 'be.This', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'anti-American', 'think', 'bigger', 'misanthropic', 'general', 'especially', 'so', 'considering', 'world', 'more', 'more', 'Americanized', 'hour']",Carnage
