The story ends with him almost killed by 'rangers' during the time when the actress is about the get married(excution plan ordered by the actress family members). The last part shows that she in the end went to the actor's place to bathe and this concludes the story. There are two sex scenes in this movie as I've seen the Malaysian bootleg version DVD9(as good as code 1's clarity) after my friend brought back from there.

16444,A1PASRZ81DY9C,076782170X,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","Viewed: 3/09Rate: 63/09: Two Moon Junction feels like a David Lynch picture because of the small oddities. I wish that Zalman King would just stop being obsessed with the need of bringing eroticism at every minute as possible because they never work. Rather what he should have done is focus on the bizarreness, complemented by the steamy scenes. When Zalman did that, Two Moon Junction got much better. The first thirty minutes of the movie failed to grasp my attention due to the trashy romance novel feel, and it got worse when the fight erupted in the night at the carnival. Strangely, from that point, Two Moon Junction actually got a whole lot better due to the intense focus on aesthetic quality and the chemistry between April DeLongpre and Perry. I liked how Zalman brought this relationship together with the Southern culture. It gives Two Moon Junction an extra boost to atmosphere, allowing the film to almost creep slowly into Body Heat territory. I was surprised to notice that the film takes place in Alabama when I thought it was Georgia. I liked Louise Fletcher in her role, and it could have been expanded more. At the beginning, I kept asking, ""Where is Mickey Rourke?"" and then forgot about him half hour later when Richard Tyson filled in his shoes quite nicely, especially when I remember the results of Wild Orchid. I liked the ending of Two Moon Junction, and I thought I had a good time watching Two Moon Junction, feeling the David Lynch moments. All in all, it's best not to take Two Moon Junction seriously but give it a try for a fun which I did.",3,Feeling David Lynch Here.,1289001600,"11 6, 2010",2010,1575,"['Viewed', '3/09Rate', '63/09', 'Two', 'Moon', 'Junction', 'feels', 'David', 'Lynch', 'picture', 'small', 'oddities', 'wish', 'Zalman', 'King', 'would', 'just', 'stop', 'being', 'obsessed', 'need', 'bringing', 'eroticism', 'minute', 'possible', 'never', 'work', 'Rather', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'focus', 'bizarreness', 'complemented', 'steamy', 'scenes', 'When', 'Zalman', 'did', 'Two', 'Moon', 'Junction', 'got', 'much', 'better', 'first', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'movie', 'failed', 'grasp', 'attention', 'due', 'trashy', 'romance', 'novel', 'feel', 'got', 'worse', 'when', 'fight', 'erupted', 'night', 'carnival', 'Strangely', 'point', 'Two', 'Moon', 'Junction', 'actually', 'got', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'due', 'intense', 'focus', 'aesthetic', 'quality', 'chemistry', 'April', 'DeLongpre', 'Perry', 'liked', 'how', 'Zalman', 'brought', 'relationship', 'together', 'Southern', 'culture', 'Two', 'Moon', 'Junction', 'extra', 'boost', 'atmosphere', 'allowing', 'film', 'almost', 'creep', 'slowly', 'Body', 'Heat', 'territory', 'was', 'surprised', 'notice', 'film', 'place', 'Alabama', 'when', 'thought', 'was', 'Georgia', 'liked', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'expanded', 'more', 'beginning', 'kept', 'asking', 'Where', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'then', 'forgot', 'hour', 'later', 'when', 'Richard', 'Tyson', 'filled', 'shoes', 'quite', 'nicely', 'especially', 'when', 'remember', 'results', 'Wild', 'Orchid', 'liked', 'ending', 'Two', 'Moon', 'Junction', 'thought', 'had', 'good', 'time', 'watching', 'Two', 'Moon', 'Junction', 'feeling', 'David', 'Lynch', 'moments', 'best', 'not', 'take', 'Two', 'Moon', 'Junction', 'seriously', 'give', 'try', 'fun', 'did']",N/A

Its worth the money just to watch this gorgeous man  maneuver his way around the ladies.Its a shame we didn't hear more of Tyson, after this, although he has done many tough-guy B movies and straight-to-DVD stuff.

He was onboard for 9 1/2 Weeks, Red Shoe Diaries, and Wild Orchid.  Love those flicks?  This one's a winner too.  Hate em?  Steer clear and let the rest of us have some fun.Music is wonderful, camera work is outstanding, and the sex scenes increase in intensity throughout the film.  The plot is simply a Southern pot-boiler about Sherilyn Fenn trying to chose between her vanilla fiancee and the ultra-hot carnival guy who makes her engines run (he looks like Michael Hutchence of INXS on steroids!).  Throw in Louise Fletcher as a wise and iron-fisted grandmother who wants to see her make the ""right"" choice, and she'll kill anybody to make sure it happens!  Also included are choice cameos by Kristy McNicol as a bi-sexual party girl, and Tattoo from Fantasy Island in his last role!  It's a hot hoot!No special features here, but the DVD is a vast improvement over the video.  Zalman King movies rely on visuals and music, so this is the only way to watch!  Definitely worth the price of admission if you like your erotica served with sexy saxophones and white clothes everywhere!  For some reason EVERY character in the movie wheres WHITE constantly.

It's more of a live action bad romance novel.  As far as the story goes, there really isn't one.  The thin plot revolves around a rich Southern debutante who is supposed to soon be married.  Instead she falls for the dirty, burly carnival worker with the long, greasy hair and the King Kong chest.  Yep, that's about it.  The sexual scenes, in my opinion, do show nudity but don't show much during the actual doing.  In all honestly, they did nothing for me personally.  I did not find the man that attractive.  Sherilynn Fenn is pretty, but the bleach blonde hair was kinda weird (and I'm a bleach blonde!).  This is not a thought provoker, it is more like an arthouse nudey.  I like to think that everything has some finer points, so I'll let you in on some.  First of all, although I'm not sure what the point was, but Kristy McNichol has a roll in this movie that makes it somewhat worth watching for the few minutes she's in it.  Second, and very laughable, Sherilynn Fenn has a ""glory hole"" into a male shower room which cracked me up.  Third, I like carnivals.  Fourth, and I was saying to myself ""I thought so"", Milla Jovovich has a small part in there as a little girl.  There's a cute dog and a cute puppy.  Uhmm, that's about it.  Okay, many people will probably find this movie laughable.  No matter how you take it - whether it is your cup of tea and you do find it sexy, or you find it hilarious, it's entertainment.

16453,AZ1UFPNARPZD2,076782170X,"Jeffrey Ellis ""bored recluse""","[85, 93]","Say this for Zalman King -- he knows how to film a sex scene.  His films are frequently ludicrous and always seem to be in danger of collapsing under their own lurid symbolism but nobody can argue that he hasn't come up with some truly erotic images.  Partly this is because King has consistently cast some of the most beautiful and sensous actors and actresses in film today.  A perfect example -- the amazing Sherilyn Fenn is Two Moon Junction, the insane Southern melodrama that remains King's &quot;best film.&quot;  Fenn is the deceptively sweet daughter of a grand old Southern family who, despite being expected to marry a typically bland social equal, finds her drawn to drifer Richard Tyson.  Now, this isn't exactly a love story -- at least not in the way that Hollywood usually makes love stories.  What is made perfectly clear here is that the main attraction between Fenn and Tyson is that they have really great sex and a lot of it.  And most of it on screen.  Certainly, Burl Ives and Juanita Moore and a few other out-of-work name actors wander through the film without disrobing and King attempts to make a few &quot;statements&quot; about the nature of man.  Fenn gives a strong performance (suggesting the charisma she'd later reveal in Twin Peaks) but in the end, this film becomes a rare combination of an unintentional campfest and an amazingly erotic film.  Watching it seems to produce a bizarre combination of being both totally amused and seriously turned on.Even though his name doesn't seem to carry the same pop cultural amusement as it used to, Zalman King is still out there -- fighting to get his whacked-out vision of a world obsessed with sex, jump cuts, and needless camera angles onto screens across the world.  The man who once played Jesus Christ in the movies has gone on to be come the foremost purveyor of pretentious sleaze -- i.e., films that try to hide their pornographic or exploitation roots by dressing all the sex and violence up with a bunch of metaphysical blather about the nature of man and such.  And I say more power to him.  Though King appears to take his work far too seriously and most of his films -- when you get right down to it -- are rather bad, they're also very entertaining in a &quot;Somebody-actually-made-this-way.&quot;  Zalman King is the Ed Wood of softcore -- his plotlines and dialouge are always good for a laugh.

This southern girl, April, just out of high school, is planning to marry the eligible bachelor, also just out of high school.  But a funny thing happens on the way to the wedding, she takes her younger sisters to a carnival.  Here she encounters the hunky carnival worker who's kind of a cross between James Dean and Tom Berenger, but with long hair.  Sparks fly when he lets himself into her house to take a shower.  Once this line has been crossed the movie explores April's sexual awakening.As said, the acting is pretty good, with the noticable exception of Kristy McNichol.  Her character, a tramp direct from the trailer park, is terrible.  She drives a semi tractor like it's a sports car just to get some liquor.  She talks April out of her top, and then relays how wnderful Mr. Hunk is in bed.The story builds up to the wedding where we think Mr. Hunk finally meets his match in the local Sheriff, but in the end all is well.

16456,A2HVC1IXR56PPS,076782170X,J. McCormick,"[3, 6]","This movie has some, er, sentimental value to me, since the two moon junction scene was the first sex scene I ever saw -- and, since I was 7 or 8 at the time, it was also (IIRC) my introduction to the idea of sex (or at least naked people kissing ;) ).In any case, based on a vague memory of that scene and the word ""junction"" I found this movie again and wanted to see it. The best I can say for it, though, is that it's not horrible. The sex scenes are not bad at all, but they're not exactly great, either.As a movie experience (vs. a soft porn experience), the movie spends quite a bit of time building April's angst at going into a life that she isn't crazy about but that her whole family wants and expects her to go into. It sets her up to make a difficult choice between what is ""best"" for her -- a marriage to a successful but plain ""company man"" fianc&eacute; -- and her libidinous attraction to a muscly carnival worker, a drunken pig with a heart of gold (sort of). Oh yeah, and glasses, which he puts on when he needs to look sophisticated. They seem to want to get the angst across so desperately that not one but TWO sex scenes end with April bursting into tears.But then it throws all this build-up away with what appears to be a ""have your cake and eat it, too"" ending that kind of renders the rest of the movie pointless. Is her choice understandable? Certainly. Will you find it satisfying? Depends on if you like the whole having and eating thing, but it certainly isn't compelling.This is definitely a movie with limited appeal, and it's hard to recommend it as anything more than a possible rental.

But the reason I bought this movie was because of the excellent soundtrack I had glimpsed on the internet, along with a few scenes that impressed me in their directing, editing, and tension like at the Carnival and in the DeLongpre's house when Sherilyn's character (April De Longpre) catches Perry in her shower. All these scenes made me consider this movie as something interesting enough to buy and watch.To me, I felt the first part was the best, mostly for its cinematography and its lighting. Especially when there is a juxtaposition of Sherilyn diving in the pool while the carnival is being installed by Perry and the rest of the crew. Along with an excellent scene while we hear the song Who do you love and an excellent scene between April and her grandmother Belle, the first part of the movie really impressed me. Even Kristy McNicols's character was perfect in her funny role and I felt she should have had more presence in the film. So to me, that first part of the movie works well.But for the second part, starting when the characters leave the carnival after a big accident, I felt the story turned more into an excuse to show some arousing scenes between Fenn and Tyson and exploit the actress's nudity. Sure the big argument between her and Perry was very funny, but when I watched her sex scenes, I still had the feeling that Sherilyn Fenn wasn't comfortable doing them for she was always crying at the end of those scenes. And to me I think that situation really hurt the film. Not only that, some of them were just over-the-top, like the one in the restaurant which to me didn't work. In the script, I also felt the movie had too much characters that were underdeveloped, though not as much as Chad - April's future husband- who I felt could have had a richer personality, other reasons to marry April, and do things that would explain why April feels that she wouldn't be happy with him and would prefer Perry instead. I also felt a loss of quality in the second part's cinematography, as if Zalman King lost interest to show some interesting visuals and found more important to see Fenn's body and not her male co-star.Now I am not saying that this movie was entirely bad. Like I said before: a very good first part and a not-that-impressive second part. But I think that Zalman King should have put more priority in his script and directing and not take too much interest on exploiting Sherilyn Fenn's nudity.

Richard Tyson is instanly likeable, possibly the most likeable character in the whole movie. Louise Fletcher delivers us evil once again and looks great doing it. I love the southern aspect of the story as well as the high society aspect that goes along with it. This is one of those movies where you get what you expected from the trailer, and it's a good thing if you liked the trailer.

16473,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,076782170X,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 5]","Two Moon Junction (Zalman King, 1988)Back in the day, I had an ex-girlfriend (well, more like a female acquaintance, but that is a long and boring story-- much like this film) who was obsessed with this flick. I never actually saw the whole thing, so I sat down recently and have it the treatment. Afterwards, I remembered why I stopped subjecting myself to Zalman King flicks after 9  Weeks. The box calls it an ""adult drama""; the translation, of course, is ""softcore"", but without anywhere near the amount of nudity or badly-simulated sex one expects from the genre.The plot, what little of it there is, involves April Delongpre (Twin Peaks' Sherilyn Fenn), a southern debutante who is getting married soon. When the carnival comes to town, however, she finds herself enmeshed in a fling with Perry (Black Hawk Down's Richard Tyson), one of the carnies. Yep, that's all there is to it.The main problem with the film-- aside, of course, from its almost entire lack of a storyline-- is the lack of chemistry between the sultry Fenn and Tyson, who comes off as a sort of low-rent Val Kilmer with far less charisma. In fact, it's grudgingly admirable that King managed to find two actors who could share almost no chemistry at all. It's the love story version of Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman in Se7en, except those two weren't supposed to like one another. Now, a better director may have been able to carry this off anyway, but King is not that better director.These days, if this movie is remembered at all, it should be as the final screen appearances of Burl Ives and Herve Villechaize combined with the first screen appearance of Milla Jovovich, though all three are eminently forgettable here, in keeping with the rest of the picture. I can't imagine why anyone would want to remember it. *",1,Two Moon Junction = One Star Movie.,1206403200,"03 25, 2008",2008,1794,"['Two', 'Moon', 'Junction', 'Zalman', 'King', '1988', 'Back', 'day', 'had', 'ex-girlfriend', 'well', 'more', 'female', 'acquaintance', 'long', 'boring', 'story', 'much', 'film', 'who', 'was', 'obsessed', 'flick', 'never', 'actually', 'saw', 'whole', 'thing', 'sat', 'down', 'recently', 'have', 'treatment', 'Afterwards', 'remembered', 'why', 'stopped', 'subjecting', 'Zalman', 'King', 'flicks', '9', 'Weeks', 'box', 'adult', 'drama', 'translation', 'course', 'softcore', 'anywhere', 'amount', 'nudity', 'badly-simulated', 'sex', 'one', 'genre.The', 'plot', 'what', 'April', 'Delongpre', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'Sherilyn', 'Fenn', 'southern', 'debutante', 'who', 'getting', 'married', 'soon', 'When', 'carnival', 'town', 'however', 'enmeshed', 'fling', 'Perry', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'Richard', 'Tyson', 'one', 'carnies', 'Yep', 'it.The', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'aside', 'course', 'almost', 'entire', 'lack', 'storyline', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'sultry', 'Fenn', 'Tyson', 'who', 'off', 'sort', 'low-rent', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'far', 'less', 'charisma', 'fact', 'grudgingly', 'admirable', 'King', 'managed', 'find', 'two', 'actors', 'who', 'could', 'share', 'almost', 'chemistry', 'love', 'story', 'version', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Se7en', 'two', 'were', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'like', 'one', 'Now', 'better', 'director', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'carry', 'off', 'anyway', 'King', 'not', 'better', 'director.These', 'days', 'movie', 'remembered', 'should', 'be', 'final', 'screen', 'appearances', 'Burl', 'Ives', 'Herve', 'Villechaize', 'combined', 'first', 'screen', 'appearance', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'three', 'are', 'eminently', 'forgettable', 'here', 'keeping', 'rest', 'picture', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'want', 'remember', '*']",N/A
