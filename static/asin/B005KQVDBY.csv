When a camera crew videotapes Montalbano and his men entering the home, they become overnight heroes.  The publicity, however, brings out the kooks and a disturbed maniac begins a macabre treasure hunt with Montalbano, sending him strange riddles linked to the kidnapping and murder of a young girl.  Montalbano and his team try to sort out the insanity before a new murder is committed.""WARNING TO PARENTS:  Be prepared: if you have innocent children, they may ask you what the big life-size doll found in the crazy old man's house is for (my own child is fully grown up, so I did not have to explain).THE AGE OF DOUBT""Nothing is as it seems in Detective Montalbano's investigation of a corpse found at sea.  After a young girl arrives from Palermo claiming to meet her aunt, who is pulling into Vigata harbor in a yacht, he discovers a connection between the corpse, the yacht, and a motorboat called ""Ace of Hearts.""  He finds himself attracted to a young Coast Guard officer assigned to help in the case, but there is no time for soul searching when a second corpse shows up and there is a gruesome mystery to solve.""The ""young girl"" who arrives from Palermo is actually a young woman, and she drives her own car.I found both episodes very entertaining.

1463921,A3RMEU4GNP60BM,B005KQVDBY,"Sussman ""Sussman""","[4, 4]","While collection Three (2 Disc) is yet to be released, please forgive my presumption of creating a review for a product yet to be released! That said I have, like those us who watch BBC 4 from the United Kingdom, and seen some of the episodes to be included in this latest offering I felt it was time for a review.Our Inspector Salvo Montalbano, who works in the fictional town of ""Vig&agrave;ta"", in the equally fictional district of ""Montelusa"" in Sicily. Where the Sun is bright and life treads at a different pace, amongst classic bleached white villages and towns that would look out of place in a tourist guide book. In this almost Mediterranean idle there is darkness, decay and at times murder.He and the members of Vigata's small police force, namely Mim&igrave; Augello, Montalbano's second-in-charge, Fazio, Gallo, Galluzzo and the incredibly stupid yet very likeable Catarella, who mans the station's phones, among other minor tasks. While his whole team have suffered from his out bursts, and sometime strange management style he cares for them and in turn they are all very loyal to him, none more so than his `eternal' girlfriend of 8 plus years. Salvo is a foodie, with a passion, and he rarely permits anything to get between him and good meal, including other social commitments. He is also an avid swimmer; so much so, his apartment is set on the beach front, in his more melancholy moments he seems to find solace in swimming. While his girlfriend, Livia, has to compete with his detective work, however, in this latest instalment we seem to see less of her, mostly hearing her on the telephone, for Salvo suspects her of infidelity. This then leaves our Inspector with a strained relationship at best with Livia, and in this series he is more than distracted by the opposite sex.Luca Zingaretti who plays the major role really brings the detective to life; his characterisation for me is spot on. His take on the character of Inspector Montalbano is very engaging you get a feel for the characters - honest, decency and his loyalty. In Salvo we see how he has his own way of doing things, this then can be at odds with his superiors, who regard him as something of loose cannon His case work always varied, and never what you would expect to happen happens - there are red herrings and misdirection!In Salvo's work nothing is black and white; mainly his cases are in the grey zone. As one reviewer put it his cases do not have happy endings, while his investigations sometimes leads to organized crime, his stories rarely get totally focused on the Mafia rather they are part of the landscape and environment of where he works in and around.Returning to Mimi Augello, who is the Deputy Commissioner of Police in Vigata, for a moment, a serial womaniser, he is married to one Beba, a young university student. Through the collusion of Montalbano they are married, their baby son will be imposed the same name Salvo Montalbano in honour of the patron. Mimi is good friend of our Inspector their interaction here, in these episodes, can at times be very funny and on occasion strained. Salvo cares deeply for his friend and will go to great lengths to save his friend from himself, male bonding Salvo style? Salvo is loyal and protective of his team in general, and without giving spoilers, this latest set of offerings will give more in-sight as his team are either challenged or threatened.The last few years have seen a plethora of foreign detective series from around Europe each series of any real credit brings fresh cultural nuances, behaviour and identity of their own. After years of British and American detective series these shows, are like a new revelation. While some may hate subtitles I can assure you that to see and hear these shows as they were originally broadcast is always best and I find them all the more enjoyable. Very highly recommended!",5,Montalbano is balancing act between the demands of his superiors and the realities of local crime and life in general,1355443200,"12 14, 2012",2012,3882,"['collection', 'Three', '2', 'Disc', 'yet', 'be', 'released', 'please', 'forgive', 'presumption', 'creating', 'review', 'product', 'yet', 'be', 'released', 'said', 'have', 'who', 'watch', 'BBC', '4', 'United', 'Kingdom', 'seen', 'episodes', 'be', 'included', 'latest', 'offering', 'felt', 'was', 'time', 'review.Our', 'Inspector', 'Salvo', 'Montalbano', 'who', 'fictional', 'town', 'Vig', 'agrave', 'ta', 'equally', 'fictional', 'district', 'Montelusa', 'Sicily', 'Where', 'Sun', 'bright', 'life', 'treads', 'different', 'pace', 'amongst', 'classic', 'bleached', 'white', 'villages', 'towns', 'would', 'look', 'place', 'tourist', 'guide', 'book', 'almost', 'Mediterranean', 'idle', 'darkness', 'decay', 'times', 'murder.He', 'members', 'Vigata', 'small', 'police', 'force', 'namely', 'Mim', 'igrave', 'Augello', 'Montalbano', 'second-in-charge', 'Fazio', 'Gallo', 'Galluzzo', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'yet', 'very', 'likeable', 'Catarella', 'who', 'station', 'phones', 'other', 'minor', 'tasks', 'whole', 'team', 'have', 'suffered', 'out', 'bursts', 'sometime', 'strange', 'management', 'style', 'turn', 'are', 'very', 'loyal', 'none', 'more', 'so', 'eternal', 'girlfriend', '8', 'years', 'Salvo', 'foodie', 'passion', 'rarely', 'anything', 'get', 'good', 'meal', 'including', 'other', 'social', 'commitments', 'also', 'avid', 'swimmer', 'so', 'much', 'apartment', 'set', 'beach', 'front', 'more', 'melancholy', 'moments', 'find', 'solace', 'swimming', 'girlfriend', 'Livia', 'compete', 'detective', 'work', 'however', 'latest', 'instalment', 'seem', 'see', 'less', 'mostly', 'hearing', 'telephone', 'Salvo', 'infidelity', 'then', 'Inspector', 'strained', 'relationship', 'best', 'Livia', 'series', 'more', 'distracted', 'opposite', 'sex.Luca', 'Zingaretti', 'who', 'major', 'role', 'really', 'detective', 'life', 'characterisation', 'spot', 'take', 'character', 'Inspector', 'Montalbano', 'very', 'engaging', 'get', 'feel', 'characters', 'honest', 'decency', 'loyalty', 'Salvo', 'see', 'how', 'own', 'way', 'doing', 'things', 'then', 'can', 'be', 'odds', 'superiors', 'who', 'regard', 'something', 'loose', 'cannon', 'case', 'work', 'always', 'varied', 'never', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'happen', 'happens', 'are', 'red', 'herrings', 'misdirection', 'Salvo', 'work', 'nothing', 'black', 'white', 'mainly', 'cases', 'are', 'grey', 'zone', 'one', 'reviewer', 'put', 'cases', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'happy', 'endings', 'investigations', 'sometimes', 'organized', 'crime', 'stories', 'rarely', 'get', 'totally', 'focused', 'Mafia', 'rather', 'are', 'part', 'landscape', 'environment', 'where', 'around.Returning', 'Mimi', 'Augello', 'who', 'Deputy', 'Commissioner', 'Police', 'Vigata', 'moment', 'serial', 'womaniser', 'married', 'one', 'Beba', 'young', 'university', 'student', 'collusion', 'Montalbano', 'are', 'married', 'baby', 'son', 'will', 'be', 'imposed', 'same', 'name', 'Salvo', 'Montalbano', 'honour', 'patron', 'Mimi', 'good', 'friend', 'Inspector', 'interaction', 'here', 'episodes', 'can', 'times', 'be', 'very', 'funny', 'occasion', 'strained', 'Salvo', 'deeply', 'friend', 'will', 'go', 'great', 'lengths', 'save', 'friend', 'male', 'bonding', 'Salvo', 'style', 'Salvo', 'loyal', 'protective', 'team', 'general', 'giving', 'spoilers', 'latest', 'set', 'offerings', 'will', 'give', 'more', 'in-sight', 'team', 'are', 'challenged', 'threatened.The', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'have', 'seen', 'plethora', 'foreign', 'detective', 'series', 'Europe', 'series', 'real', 'credit', 'brings', 'fresh', 'cultural', 'nuances', 'behaviour', 'identity', 'own', 'years', 'British', 'American', 'detective', 'series', 'shows', 'are', 'new', 'revelation', 'may', 'hate', 'subtitles', 'can', 'assure', 'see', 'hear', 'shows', 'were', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'always', 'best', 'find', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'Very', 'highly', 'recommended']",Detective Montalbano: Episodes 21 and 22

Here's why: they are great storylines from Andrea Camilleri, great directing, great acting, and great settings; in short, the complete package for quality entertainment, which, by the way, seems rare these days. We've been inundated with too many other sereis in the genre that rely too much on car chases, shootouts, Ninja-like and impractical fight scenes rather than plot.If you're here on episodes 21 & 22 chances are good that you're already familiar with Montalbano so there's no need to convince you that these two are also worth watching.
