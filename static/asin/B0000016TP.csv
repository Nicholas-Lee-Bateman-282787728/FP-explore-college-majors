489501,A1MVLC8E5WJDD3,B0000016TP,C. Boerger,"[41, 41]","While this production of Lakme is far from perfect, the opportunity to see a rarely performed work of extreme lyrical beauty featuring the great Joan Sutherland in one of her signature roles is more than enough justification for purchasing the DVD.Lakme is an unfairly neglected opera, more known for its showpieces than for the work as a whole, and it is difficult to understand why. Personally, I think audiences would take to this score, which is chockful of memorable melodies and is obviously influenced by Bizet, because of its post-Carmen sound(especially apparent in the orchestration) mixed with the exoticism that was so popular in French opera at that time. Granted, Lakme lacks the depth of Carmen, the uniqueness, the sheer untethered ingenuity, not to mention the standout characters, and the romantic connection here seems forced and unconvincing. Basically, it's all about the music, but what music. Lakme might be fluff, but fluff has seldom sounded better.The title role is a great one for any dramatic lyrical soprano, since the Indian princess is onstage for much of the opera and is given a plethora of lovely music, from the well-known Bell Song and Flower Duet to some very moving introspective arias(my personal favorite is Act Three's Sous le ciel tour etoile...just devastating) to a couple of long winding love duets, finally to a dramatic death scene. Basically, Lakme is the soprano's baby all the way, a showcase for a true diva, and Dame Joan Sutherland is a diva-and-a-half.This production was obviously done with the intention of promoting her above everything else. The performance is by the Australian Opera, where Sutherland is both a beloved native and a familiar presence, practically royalty, and it is led by her doting husband Richard Bonynge who conducts with loving attention to her voice. The supporting cast, lacking any big names, is serviceable but unspectacular(the inconsistent tenor gets an understandably tepid response from the audience during  his curtain call), as though the powers that be were careful not to cast anyone who might upstage Dame Joan. This makes for a less fulfilling performance overall. Still, if you are going to revolve a whole production around a single performer, you can't do better than Joan Sutherland, and the diva doesn't disappoint.This was done in the mid-70's when Dame Joan was probably a few years past her prime, yet you would hardly know it based on her performance; the only weakness I could detect was the occasional tendency not to sustain some of the high notes for as long as she would have in her youth. Otherwise, the voice, that incredible voice, is still there, in all its power and glory, in all its heartbreaking beauty. Sutherland has never been known for her physical pulchritude, or for her acting ability, her main strength, aside from that distinctive voice, is a little thing called presence. Here she is as regal, as feminine, as strong-willed, as powerful, as larger-than-life as ever.Bonynge has a reputation for being a by-the-numbers conductor, and that is in evidence here. He brings out the score's inherent beauty, but loses much of the passion(his reading from the '60's for Decca Records, also with his wife, is better, more definitive, but he is helped along by an abler cast). The production is pretty and colorful, appropriately atmospheric and exotic(giving a real sense of place) if a bit crowded for the somewhat compact stage. The picture and sound quality are superior for a broadcast from that era.Vanity projects don't often succeed, but this is an exception. It helps to have a centerpiece with the chops of Joan Sutherland. And to have the lovely music of Leo Delibes, of course.",4,"Delibes, Sutherland...that's all you need to know",1153785600,"07 25, 2006",2006,3707,"['production', 'Lakme', 'far', 'perfect', 'opportunity', 'see', 'rarely', 'performed', 'work', 'extreme', 'lyrical', 'beauty', 'featuring', 'great', 'Joan', 'Sutherland', 'one', 'signature', 'more', 'enough', 'justification', 'purchasing', 'DVD.Lakme', 'unfairly', 'neglected', 'opera', 'more', 'known', 'showpieces', 'work', 'whole', 'difficult', 'understand', 'why', 'Personally', 'think', 'audiences', 'would', 'take', 'score', 'chockful', 'memorable', 'melodies', 'obviously', 'influenced', 'Bizet', 'post-Carmen', 'sound', 'especially', 'apparent', 'orchestration', 'mixed', 'exoticism', 'was', 'so', 'popular', 'French', 'opera', 'time', 'Granted', 'Lakme', 'depth', 'Carmen', 'uniqueness', 'sheer', 'untethered', 'ingenuity', 'not', 'mention', 'standout', 'characters', 'romantic', 'connection', 'here', 'forced', 'unconvincing', 'Basically', 'music', 'what', 'music', 'Lakme', 'might', 'be', 'fluff', 'fluff', 'seldom', 'sounded', 'better.The', 'title', 'role', 'great', 'one', 'dramatic', 'lyrical', 'soprano', 'Indian', 'princess', 'onstage', 'much', 'opera', 'given', 'plethora', 'lovely', 'music', 'well-known', 'Bell', 'Song', 'Flower', 'Duet', 'very', 'moving', 'introspective', 'arias', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Act', 'Three', 'Sous', 'le', 'ciel', 'tour', 'etoile', 'just', 'devastating', 'couple', 'long', 'winding', 'love', 'duets', 'finally', 'dramatic', 'death', 'scene', 'Basically', 'Lakme', 'soprano', 'baby', 'way', 'showcase', 'true', 'diva', 'Dame', 'Joan', 'Sutherland', 'diva-and-a-half.This', 'production', 'was', 'obviously', 'done', 'intention', 'promoting', 'everything', 'else', 'performance', 'Australian', 'Opera', 'where', 'Sutherland', 'beloved', 'native', 'familiar', 'presence', 'practically', 'royalty', 'led', 'doting', 'husband', 'Richard', 'Bonynge', 'who', 'loving', 'attention', 'voice', 'supporting', 'cast', 'lacking', 'big', 'names', 'serviceable', 'unspectacular', 'inconsistent', 'tenor', 'understandably', 'tepid', 'response', 'audience', 'curtain', 'call', 'powers', 'be', 'were', 'careful', 'not', 'cast', 'anyone', 'who', 'might', 'upstage', 'Dame', 'Joan', 'less', 'fulfilling', 'performance', 'overall', 'Still', 'are', 'going', 'revolve', 'whole', 'production', 'single', 'performer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'better', 'Joan', 'Sutherland', 'diva', ""n't"", 'disappoint.This', 'was', 'done', 'mid-70', 'when', 'Dame', 'Joan', 'was', 'probably', 'few', 'years', 'prime', 'would', 'hardly', 'know', 'based', 'performance', 'only', 'weakness', 'could', 'detect', 'was', 'occasional', 'tendency', 'not', 'sustain', 'high', 'notes', 'as', 'long', 'would', 'have', 'youth', 'Otherwise', 'voice', 'incredible', 'voice', 'still', 'there', 'power', 'glory', 'heartbreaking', 'beauty', 'Sutherland', 'never', 'been', 'known', 'physical', 'pulchritude', 'acting', 'ability', 'main', 'strength', 'aside', 'distinctive', 'voice', 'little', 'thing', 'called', 'presence', 'Here', 'regal', 'feminine', 'strong-willed', 'powerful', 'as', 'larger-than-life', 'ever.Bonynge', 'reputation', 'being', 'by-the-numbers', 'conductor', 'evidence', 'here', 'out', 'score', 'inherent', 'beauty', 'much', 'passion', 'reading', ""'60"", 'Decca', 'Records', 'also', 'wife', 'better', 'more', 'definitive', 'helped', 'abler', 'cast', 'production', 'pretty', 'colorful', 'appropriately', 'atmospheric', 'exotic', 'giving', 'real', 'sense', 'place', 'bit', 'crowded', 'somewhat', 'compact', 'stage', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'superior', 'broadcast', 'era.Vanity', 'projects', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'succeed', 'exception', 'have', 'centerpiece', 'chops', 'Joan', 'Sutherland', 'have', 'lovely', 'music', 'Leo', 'Delibes', 'course']",Delibes - Lakme VHS

And what warmth and expression; I now understand why she was described as the voice of the century.What a shame she never performed Brunnhilde (as far as I know).As far as the production itself is concerned, the sound is a bit ragged, and shows signs of heavy noise reduction.

489503,A2VJ80PM1G00QV,B0000016TP,drkhimxz,"[1, 1]","First, simply to emphasize the point, the DVD version by Kultur, unlike the VHS, does have English subtitles, and, yes, they are embedded. To most non-specialist viewers the subtitles are a major plus (as Beverly Sills who introduced surtitles to America has pointed  out is true of live performances); I cannot speak for those who can follow the French language of the production.Second, ignoring comparisons with other productions or other works in which Joan Sutherland appeared, focusing only on what is to be seen and heard in the performance which I have just seen on the TV screen, I can only say that, to me, it was quite a delight, visually rich with color,and, replete with garlands of wonderful melodies,for the most part, admirably sung.As have some reviewers, I found the lead tenor to be without the vocal or physical stature to allow Sutherland to be seen as the young, innocent girl of her father's description. What was required was a six foot four inch tower of vocal strength. However, the other singers were adequate to the demands made upon them, if not of the highest caliber.All in all, a fine staging of what could be a great Broadway hit, and, I should think, a production which will provide viewers with an evening of rich pleasure.A note on comparisons: By no stretch of imagination can Joan Sutherland match the performance of Lily Pons, who owned the role for decades at the Met, in concerts and on radio. However, it is equally true that Lily Pons could not match the statuesque presence and sound of Sutherland. Two styles, two appearances, two wonderful voices, neither with the acting ability that is increasingly being demanded. Better or worse need not be the judgment of a viewer with no intention other than find pleasure in a performance; each is distinctive, both can entertain, one or both, may impress mightily or disappoint. Each of us sees and hears differently, emotionally reacts differently.

Having seen photos of Lily Pons in the role of Lakme one may wish for a more alluring leading lady, but the Pons voice could never hold a candle to Dame Sutherland.

There is not a dull musical moment in the whole production, and it is imaginatively staged. One does not go to the opera for great drama, except perhaps in Wagner when you get little else.

The duet between Lakme and her servant (I guess that's what she was) was weak and faint, though it was the only tune in the first hour, which is all I watched.  I was bored stiff.  I was revolted by the cute Britishers invading the sacred temple, but that was the plot.  The only other tune in Lakme that I know of is The Bell Song, and I don't like it, too modal or minor or something.  Like Ophelia's mad scene in Hamlet.  Also French.  I love the French.  I wish I were French, wish I lived in France.  Sigh.  But I don't like their operas.  Before I forget it, I want to comment on the first review of this opera.  The idea of Sutherland singing wagner is obscene.  The man was a monster and a hack composer who like sondheim has one tune to his credit and nothing else.  (The wedding march, with sondheim it's ""Send in the Clowns"".)  Unlike the the other 3 or 4 rhapsodic reviewers, I can easily see why this opera is neglected.  It has no tunes.  And this is Delibes' only ""successful"" opera on top of that.  I own the CDs of a couple of his ballets which I heard on the radio and thought I liked and therefore bought, but they're mediocre too.  The French are intellectual and intelligent.  Music isn't.  Well, it takes an intelligent person to write it of course, but it takes more than that.  Music is not France's strong suit.

I have a list of these. We had to wait a long time for a visually and audibly satisfying Faust (Gounod) till this year. Wonder when they will produce a hi-def Samson et Delilah (Saint Sains) with the ballet in it, or ballets like La Boutique Fantasque (never produced for the small screen to the best of my knowledge) and/or Gaite Parisienne where one has to content oneself with a 1950s film... This applies to Lakme as well, to an extent.The video is not as grainy as one might expect, but if viewed on a 40+ inch HD TV may appear muddy. It has 'ingrained' if I may put it that way, subtitles in English. They cant be switched off... no complaints. Audio is just about as good as it can get, given the time of the recording. No complaints there either.The singing and the eye to detail - those factors make this DVD worth possessing. One is totally taken in by Joan Sutherland's voice and its clarity and absolute control - whether singing the delicate lyrical pieces that dominate most of the opera or for that matter the bel-canto portions especially in the 'Bell Aria'. The supporting cast, although overshadowed by Sutherland's reputation and singing is just about as good as it can possibly get. Absolutely everyone.The eye to detail is simply magnificent. The costumes, Indian dances and the props are as authentic as they can get (except Sutherland's own costume). The dances in the second act are fabulous. Yes, they are a slightly westernized and sanitized version of some classical Indian dances, but luckily without caricaturization of them. I hope any future versions of these don't make them look like something danced in some unrealistic exotic dance bars. The deities, the idols and the costumes are as near to the real thing and unoffensive as they can get.I have no hesitation in giving this DVD the maximum. This recording would familiarize one almost instantly with the music and approach that would be a benchmark for any future productions of this rather instantly enjoyable Opera.

I wholeheartedly recommend this DVD to anyone who has an interest in either Lakme and/or Joan Sutherland.",4,Excellent all round production,1158537600,"09 18, 2006",2006,672,"['singing', 'strongest', 'plus', 'production', 'singers', 'do', 'splendid', 'job', 'respective', 'roles', 'acting', 'undistinguished', 'stage', 'settings', 'adequate', 'create', 'appropriately', 'lavish', 'indian', 'setting', 'smacked', 'plastic.For', '30', 'year', 'old', 'production', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'acceptable', 'Non', 'removable', 'English', 'sub-titles', 'are', 'included', 'brief', 'description', 'plot', 'orchestral', 'prelude', 'act.This', 'one', 'favourite', 'operas', 'production', 'earned', 'top', 'shelf', 'location', 'opera', 'DVDs', 'wholeheartedly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'who', 'interest', 'Lakme', 'and/or', 'Joan', 'Sutherland']",Delibes - Lakme VHS
