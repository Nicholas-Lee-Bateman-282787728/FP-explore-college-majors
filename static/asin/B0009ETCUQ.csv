The film stirs up the real unpredictable nature of people. The premise is a good one. Bruce Willis as a cop has to rescue a family held captive in their own house, but thats not all. His gung ho motivation is that if he retrieves a disc hidden in a dvd case that pertains to a corrupt group, he saves his own kidnapped family. He plays the anxious, must do savior unusually well. The threesome teenagers holding the family in the house(one reluctant)do a decent job of playing some confused, ruthless oddballs. Their is some strong violence and an undercurrent of shear nerve racking bombardment. The empathy drawn out by Willis for his family is impressivly done.

But maybe Willis would have been better off if the movie was never made.""Hostage"" is really an inept piece of work that showed great promise but soon just becomes a barrage of action sequences that seem more implausible by the minute.Willis plays Jeff Talley a hostage negotiator who lives in L.A. The movie opens with Talley on the job trying to talk a husband out of killing his son and wife, who has been cheating on him. When snipers say they have a clear shot of the man Talley calls them off holding a sign that reads ""no one will get killed today"" thus setting up Willis' character as a good honest cop who really cares about these people. As the situation goes on Talley loses control and all three are killed. Talley takes this hard especially when the boy dies in his arms.The movie than fastforwards 12 years later and now Talley is no longer a negotiator but is sheriff of a small county and is having problems with his wife and daughter, played in the movie by Willis' actually daughter. The daughter, Amanda (Rumer Willis) thinks her parents are going to get a divorce. And even though the parents protest, secretly I think they feel the same way.Right now I suppose the movie sounds entertaining. And it is but that is only because we think the movie is going to focus on Willis and reveal more of these demons in his closet.Kevin Pollack plays Walter Smith, who wife has died and now takes care of his two children, Tommy (Jimmy Bennett) and Jennifer (Michelle Horn). As they drive home three young boys see Jennifer. One of them then gets the idea to follow the girl to her home and steal their car. Apparently this is what the three boys, played by Ben Foster, Jonathan Tucker, and Marshall Allman, do for kicks.Once the boys break in and hold the family hostage after a series of mishaps occur, for instance, none of the boys thought of the police showing up the movie hits the tone that will be played through-out.The movie was directed by Florent Siri and written by Doug Richardson. I'm not familiar with either. I will say this though Siri does give the movie some style. Notice the slow motion action scenes. It seems like someone has been watching Sam Peckinpah's movies. But little else is offered to this movie. The writting at times is sloppy. Characters say such ridiculous things with a straight face. Simple lines like ""I'm the man"" are said with great dramatic impact. Are you kidding me?But after the first hostage situation the movie has what it feels is a twist. Now Talley is called back on the case after he calls the F.B.I. to take control of the case because his family is now being held hostage unless he can get a DVD of Ernst Lubitsch's ""Heaven Can Wait"". And it is not wanted as a rental. There is some sort of important information, what I don't know, it is not all very clearly explained, on the DVD that the bad guys just have to get. I suppose though what is on the disc doesn't matter. Hitchcock would play around with this. What the villians wanted in the movie wasn't so important but the actions they took to get the information was. So Talley has to go inside the house and get the DVD or his family will be killed.Now Talley must face his fears after things went so wrong with the boy 12 years earlier and finds himself in the same situation.As I watched the movie I thought why did the director and the writer chose ""Heaven Can Wait""? It must have been done for a reason. After a while I though maybe the connection between the two movies is this; In ""Heaven Can Wait"" a man is sent to Hell where he is confronted with his past sins. In ""Hostage"" Jeff Talley must also confront his past demons. Other than that I can't think of anything else.""Hostage"" for all of its action is really a pretty boring picture. Once the movie started to focus more on the action and less on the characters I found myself tunning out every now and then. The movie started off as a character study of Talley and then just abandons everything for action. Why? They were starting off so well. But what are we going to do. Here is a perfect example of why Hollywood has been losing money lately as attendance is a recent lows. People simply aren't going out to see movies anymore because we don't wnat to see movies like ""Hostage"". Why should I pay 10 dollars to goes see junk like this when I can rent it for half the price or even wait for it to play on TV? This is why of weeks Hollywood is losing out. They don't realize we are sick of their movies. But go ahead Hollywood keep making these movies and losing money. It merely shows how out of touch you are with the public.  * 1\2 out of *****Bottom-line: Promising but ultimately inept movie that is a barrage of action sequences and very little human

It's much more intelligent and original. It's without a doubt his finest presence onscreen since ""The Whole Nine Yards"".In the opening sequence, hostage negotiator Jeff Taley (Willis) is trying to stop a maniacal father from killing himself and his family. When Taley fails, it leaves a lasting emotional void on him and retires to a small community in California with his family (which includes Willis's real - life daugter Rumer as his daughter Amanda).Meanwhile, a trio of teenage punks decide to hijack a car owned by rich money launderer and family man Walter Smith (Kevin Pollak). The plan goes well until Smith's son trips the silent alarm and the cops arrive. The trio of boys take Pollak's family hostage and nearly kill Smith.Talley is brought back in to handle the situation. While on his way there, he learns that Pollak's character is a money launderer who left a secret code on a dvd. Talley is ordered to go into the Smith household and retrieve the dvd, or his family, who have been kidnapped by the men Smith works for, will be executed.This film is a great piece of cinema, but if you're not a big fan of violence, this film is not for you. It's as violent as all hell. Some of the film's most eyecatching parts include a 9 -year - old bleeding to death from a gunshot wound to the chin, a dog is decapitated by the terrorists who kidnap Talley's family, plus people getting shot, stabbed and lit on fire.Other than that, I think most people will truly enjoy this film.

I was a huge fan of his fabulous French criminals vs. cops vs. terrorists French action-fest 'The Nest'.  And when I saw that he would be directing 'Hostage', starring Bruce Willis no less, I figured it would rock just like his previous film.  I was severely deluded.The story goes something like this:  three annoying criminal teenagers take a family hostage.  The father of the family has some shady criminal business dealings going on and his kids are annoying.  Bruce Willis is, of course, a damaged ex-hostage negotiator now working in a small town.  He gets called in to handle this hostage situation.  But its not that easy...the hostage father's criminal partners want some computer disc from the house so they kidnap Willis' family so that he(Willis)will get the disc for them.  This makes no sense.  If the evil criminal partners wanted the disc, why not just wait till the hostage situation ends and then go in and get the disc later?  Why bother with all the drama of kidnapping Bruce's family?  This, like most every decision made in this film, makes no sense.Okay, Siri's direction is not bad at all.  The style he purveyed in 'The Nest' is just as prevelant in 'Hostage'.  Its just the performances of the mainly child-actor cast that makes the film suffer.  Every child in this film is completely and utterly annoying.  Every thing they do is stupid and you just hope they all end up shooting each other in the face.  These children, every single one of them, should never be allowed to act again.  They are truly awful.  Its almost insulting to be forced to watch them.  Willis plays his role as he plays every role he gets.  He's basically the same character in each film only with a different job, which isn't bad...you just know what you're gonna get.'Hostage' is just not a good film.  The characters are annoying, the plot irritates, and I'm really disappointed that Florent Siri would pick such a sloppy script to make his American debut.  Hopefully he chooses something better for his next project so the American public can see what this guy can really do.Skip 'Hostage' and check out Siri's 'The Nest' instead.",2,Defecation,1122854400,"08 1, 2005",2005,2231,"['was', 'excited', 'see', 'French', 'director', 'Florent', 'Siri', 'was', 'making', 'english', 'language', 'debut', 'was', 'huge', 'fan', 'fabulous', 'French', 'criminals', 'vs.', 'cops', 'vs.', 'terrorists', 'French', 'action-fest', ""'The"", 'Nest', 'when', 'saw', 'would', 'be', 'directing', 'starring', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'no', 'less', 'figured', 'would', 'rock', 'just', 'previous', 'film', 'was', 'severely', 'deluded.The', 'story', 'something', 'three', 'annoying', 'criminal', 'teenagers', 'take', 'family', 'hostage', 'father', 'family', 'shady', 'criminal', 'business', 'dealings', 'going', 'kids', 'are', 'annoying', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'course', 'damaged', 'ex-hostage', 'negotiator', 'now', 'working', 'small', 'town', 'called', 'handle', 'hostage', 'situation', 'not', 'easy', 'hostage', 'father', 'criminal', 'partners', 'want', 'computer', 'disc', 'house', 'kidnap', 'Willis', 'family', 'so', 'Willis', 'will', 'get', 'disc', 'sense', 'evil', 'criminal', 'partners', 'wanted', 'disc', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'wait', 'till', 'hostage', 'situation', 'then', 'go', 'get', 'disc', 'later', 'Why', 'bother', 'drama', 'kidnapping', 'Bruce', 'family', 'most', 'decision', 'made', 'film', 'sense.Okay', 'Siri', 'direction', 'not', 'bad', 'style', 'purveyed', ""'The"", 'Nest', 'just', 'as', 'prevelant', ""'Hostage"", 'just', 'performances', 'mainly', 'child-actor', 'cast', 'film', 'suffer', 'child', 'film', 'completely', 'utterly', 'annoying', 'thing', 'do', 'stupid', 'just', 'hope', 'end', 'up', 'shooting', 'other', 'face', 'children', 'single', 'one', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'allowed', 'act', 'again', 'are', 'truly', 'awful', 'almost', 'insulting', 'be', 'forced', 'watch', 'Willis', 'role', 'role', 'basically', 'same', 'character', 'film', 'only', 'different', 'job', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'gon', 'get', ""'Hostage"", 'just', 'not', 'good', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'annoying', 'plot', 'irritates', ""'m"", 'really', 'disappointed', 'Florent', 'Siri', 'would', 'pick', 'sloppy', 'script', 'make', 'American', 'debut', 'Hopefully', 'something', 'better', 'next', 'project', 'American', 'public', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'guy', 'can', 'really', 'do.Skip', ""'Hostage"", 'check', 'out', 'Siri', ""'The"", 'Nest', 'instead']",N/A

Neither film made too much in terms of box-office, but they did show that a new wave of genre directors may not be coming out of the US but from France of all places. Another name to add to this list is Florent Siri and his first major Hollywood project Hostage shows that he has the style and skills to make it in Hollywood.Hostage is another Bruce Willis vehicle that was adapted by Doug Richardson (wrote the screenplay for Die Hard 2) from Robert Crais' novel. Hostage is a very good thriller with a unique twist to the hostage-theme. Willis' character is a burn-out ex-L.A. SWAT prime hostage negotiator whose last major case quickly ended up in the death of suspect and hostages. We next see him as chief of police of a small, Northern California community where low-crime is the norm. We soon find out that his peace of mind and guilt from his last case may have eased since taking this new job, but his family life has suffered as a consequence. All of the peace and tranquility is quickly shattered as a trio of local teen hoodlums break into the opulent home of one Walter Smith (played by Kevin Pollak). What is originally an attempt to steal of of the Smith's expensive rides turn into a hostage situation as mistakes after mistakes are made by the teens.From this moment on Hostage would've turned into a by-the-numbers hostage thriller, but Richardson's screenplay ratchets things up by forcing Willis' character back into the negotiator's role as shadowy character who remain hooded and faceless throughout the film kidnap his wife and daughter. It would seem that these individuals want something from the Smith's home and would kill Willis' character's family to achieve their goals. The situation does get abit convoluted at times and the final reel of the film ends just abit too nicely after what everyone goes through the first 2/3's of the film.The characters in the film are developed enough to give each individual a specific motivation and enough backstory to explain why they ended up in the situation they've gotten themselves into. Willis' performance in Hostage is actually one of better ones in the last couple years. The weariness he gives off during the film is more due to his character's state of mind rather than Willis phoning in his performance. I would dare say that his role as Chief of Police Jeff Talley is his best in the last 2-3 years. The other performance that stands out has to be Ben Foster as the teen sociopath Mars. His character and Foster's performance straddles the line between being comedic and over-the-top. What we get instead is one creepy individual who almost becomes the boogeyman of the film. In fact, the last twenty minutes of Hostage makes Mars into a slasher-film type character who can't seem to die.The real star of the film has to be Florent Siri's direction and sense of style. From the very first frame all the way to the last, Siri gives Hostage the classic 70's and 80's Italian giallo look and feel. Siri's use of bright primary colors in conjuction with the earthy, desaturated look of the film reminds me of some of the best work of Argento, Bava, Fulci and Lenzi. In particular, Siri's film owes alot of its look to films such as Tenebrae, The Bird with the Crystal Plummage, and The Psychic. Certain scenes, especially the penultimate climax in the Smith home, take on an almost dreamlike quality. Siri's homage to the classic giallis even gives Hostage some sequences that would comfortably fit in a 70's slasher film.Florent Siri's Hostage is not a perfect film and at times its increasing tension without any form of release can be unbearable to some people, but it succeeds well enough as a thriller. It also shows that Siri knows his craft well and instead of mimicking and cloning scenes from the giallis he's fond of, he emulates and adds his own brushstrokes. The film is not for everyone and some people may find the story convoluted if not dull at times, but for me the film works well overall. Siri is one director that people should keep an eye on.",4,A very good homage to classic Italian gialli,1129334400,"10 15, 2005",2005,4508,"['last', 'year', 'so', 'seen', 'rise', 'several', 'new', 'directors', 'France', 'who', ""'ve"", 'made', 'quite', 'splash', 'Hollywood', 'debuts', 'Alejandro', 'Aja', 'Haute', 'Tension', 'Switchblade', 'Romance/High', 'Tension', 'who', 'brought', 'back', 'late', '70', 'early', '80', 'sensibilities', 'what', 'good', 'slasher', 'exploitation', 'film', 'Then', 'Jean-Francois', 'Richet', '2005', 'remake', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'early', 'classic', 'Assault', 'Precicnt', '13', 'surprised', 'quite', 'abit', 'industry', 'film', 'made', 'too', 'much', 'terms', 'box-office', 'did', 'show', 'new', 'wave', 'genre', 'directors', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'coming', 'US', 'France', 'places', 'name', 'add', 'list', 'Florent', 'Siri', 'first', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'project', 'Hostage', 'style', 'skills', 'make', 'Hollywood.Hostage', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'vehicle', 'was', 'adapted', 'Doug', 'Richardson', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'Die', 'Hard', '2', 'Robert', 'Crais', 'novel', 'Hostage', 'very', 'good', 'thriller', 'unique', 'twist', 'hostage-theme', 'Willis', 'character', 'burn-out', 'ex-L.A.', 'SWAT', 'prime', 'hostage', 'negotiator', 'last', 'major', 'case', 'quickly', 'ended', 'up', 'death', 'suspect', 'hostages', 'next', 'see', 'chief', 'police', 'small', 'Northern', 'California', 'community', 'where', 'low-crime', 'norm', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'peace', 'mind', 'guilt', 'last', 'case', 'may', 'have', 'eased', 'taking', 'new', 'job', 'family', 'life', 'suffered', 'consequence', 'peace', 'tranquility', 'quickly', 'shattered', 'trio', 'local', 'teen', 'hoodlums', 'break', 'opulent', 'home', 'one', 'Walter', 'Smith', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Pollak', 'What', 'originally', 'attempt', 'steal', 'Smith', 'expensive', 'rides', 'turn', 'hostage', 'situation', 'mistakes', 'mistakes', 'are', 'made', 'teens.From', 'moment', 'Hostage', 'would', ""'ve"", 'turned', 'by-the-numbers', 'hostage', 'thriller', 'Richardson', 'screenplay', 'ratchets', 'things', 'up', 'forcing', 'Willis', 'character', 'back', 'negotiator', 'role', 'shadowy', 'character', 'who', 'remain', 'hooded', 'faceless', 'film', 'kidnap', 'wife', 'daughter', 'would', 'seem', 'individuals', 'want', 'something', 'Smith', 'home', 'would', 'kill', 'Willis', 'character', 'family', 'achieve', 'goals', 'situation', 'get', 'abit', 'convoluted', 'times', 'final', 'reel', 'film', 'just', 'abit', 'too', 'nicely', 'what', 'everyone', 'first', '2/3', 'film.The', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'developed', 'enough', 'give', 'individual', 'specific', 'motivation', 'enough', 'backstory', 'explain', 'why', 'ended', 'up', 'situation', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'Willis', 'performance', 'Hostage', 'actually', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'weariness', 'film', 'more', 'due', 'character', 'state', 'mind', 'rather', 'Willis', 'phoning', 'performance', 'would', 'dare', 'say', 'role', 'Chief', 'Police', 'Jeff', 'Talley', 'best', 'last', '2-3', 'years', 'other', 'performance', 'out', 'be', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'teen', 'sociopath', 'Mars', 'character', 'Foster', 'performance', 'line', 'being', 'comedic', 'over-the-top', 'What', 'get', 'instead', 'one', 'creepy', 'individual', 'who', 'almost', 'boogeyman', 'film', 'fact', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'Hostage', 'Mars', 'slasher-film', 'type', 'character', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'die.The', 'real', 'star', 'film', 'be', 'Florent', 'Siri', 'direction', 'sense', 'style', 'very', 'first', 'frame', 'way', 'last', 'Siri', 'Hostage', 'classic', '70', '80', 'Italian', 'giallo', 'look', 'feel', 'Siri', 'use', 'bright', 'primary', 'colors', 'conjuction', 'earthy', 'desaturated', 'look', 'film', 'best', 'work', 'Argento', 'Bava', 'Fulci', 'Lenzi', 'particular', 'Siri', 'film', 'alot', 'look', 'films', 'such', 'Tenebrae', 'Bird', 'Crystal', 'Plummage', 'Psychic', 'Certain', 'scenes', 'especially', 'penultimate', 'climax', 'Smith', 'home', 'take', 'almost', 'dreamlike', 'quality', 'Siri', 'homage', 'classic', 'giallis', 'even', 'Hostage', 'sequences', 'would', 'comfortably', 'fit', '70', 'slasher', 'film.Florent', 'Siri', 'Hostage', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'times', 'increasing', 'tension', 'form', 'release', 'can', 'be', 'unbearable', 'people', 'well', 'enough', 'thriller', 'also', 'Siri', 'craft', 'well', 'instead', 'mimicking', 'cloning', 'scenes', 'giallis', 'fond', 'own', 'brushstrokes', 'film', 'not', 'everyone', 'people', 'may', 'find', 'story', 'convoluted', 'not', 'dull', 'times', 'film', 'well', 'overall', 'Siri', 'one', 'director', 'people', 'should', 'keep', 'eye']",N/A

Then I thought it was actually going to be a departure for Bruce; although there IS a lot of action and shooting going on in this movie, most of it is done by other people.  The only thing Bruce really does is cry a lot.The premise of the film was good; a former hostage negotiator has his own family taken hostage in order to motivate him to end another hostage situation quickly.  Aside from that, though, the film is filled with every cliche' that Hollywood could throw out at us, including the cute and clever kid who helps our hero, the psycho teenage bad guy (who in this case was so melodramatically awful that he should be banned from ever acting again), the ""cute"" teen girl is trouble (who is actually pretty plain looking), the shadowy group of bad guys who are breaking the law in some manner that is never revealed to us, plus lots of guns and a few explosions.Unfortunately, Hostage is nothing new, nothing original and nothing to get excited about seeing.",2,Held Hostage by this Movie,1120953600,"07 10, 2005",2005,1090,"['first', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'action', 'movie', 'where', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'around', 'shoots', 'lot', 'people', 'Then', 'thought', 'was', 'actually', 'going', 'be', 'departure', 'Bruce', 'lot', 'action', 'shooting', 'going', 'movie', 'most', 'done', 'other', 'people', 'only', 'thing', 'Bruce', 'really', 'cry', 'lot.The', 'premise', 'film', 'was', 'good', 'former', 'hostage', 'negotiator', 'own', 'family', 'taken', 'hostage', 'order', 'motivate', 'end', 'hostage', 'situation', 'quickly', 'Aside', 'though', 'film', 'filled', 'cliche', 'Hollywood', 'could', 'throw', 'out', 'including', 'cute', 'clever', 'kid', 'who', 'hero', 'psycho', 'teenage', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'case', 'was', 'so', 'melodramatically', 'awful', 'should', 'be', 'banned', 'ever', 'acting', 'again', 'cute', 'teen', 'girl', 'trouble', 'who', 'actually', 'pretty', 'plain', 'looking', 'shadowy', 'group', 'bad', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'breaking', 'law', 'manner', 'never', 'revealed', 'lots', 'guns', 'few', 'explosions.Unfortunately', 'Hostage', 'nothing', 'new', 'nothing', 'original', 'nothing', 'get', 'excited', 'seeing']",N/A
904281,AI46E73DWKD2B,B0009ETCUQ,BackToGood,"[0, 0]","HOSTAGE (2005) is an incredibly stylish suspense thriller peppered with cinematic flourishes: camera angles, long-view tracking shots, slow-mo action sequences, and moody music. Directed by then-newcomer Florent Siri, the film has beautiful scenery, mainly an ultra-tech hilltop mansion. The amazing opening credits draws you in immediately. Backed by a pulse-pounding score, the credits roll with an anime-type design, one of my all-time favorite opening film sequences. Then the last part of the credits craftily segues into the film's first hostage confrontation. A man gone over the edge is holding his wife and young son hostage, while famous, world-weary L.A. negotiator Jeff Talley (the film's protagonist superbly played by action icon Bruce Willis) tries to talk him down in a very intense and disturbing scene. Flashforward 1 year to the film's setting in a small California town where Talley has taken a job as the local police chief in order to run away from his past failure. Thinking that no major crime can happen, Talley is content to live out his days here, against his wife (well-played by Serena Scott Thomas) and daughter's (played by Rumer Willis, who is Bruce's real-life daughter) wishes. Talley's family still commutes between L.A. and the town, as his wife and daughter are discontented and only visit him on the weekends.Enter the other film's major players: the Smith family, comprised of Walter (played with the usual comic aplomb by Kevin Pollak) and his children, the rebellious teen Jennifer (Michelle Horn) and tech-savvy 8-year old Tommy (Jimmy Bennett). Horn and Bennett are solid and do a good job of being convincingly afraid without ever delving into annoying territory, as many a child actor can from time to time! Rounding out the cast are the film's bad guys, 3 malcontents, the Kelly brothers Dennis (played with wide-eyed, jittery, glee by Jonathan Tucker) and Kevin (persuasively played by Marshall Allman), and their partner-in-crime Mars (brilliantly played by Ben Foster in what should have been a career-making performance!). Dennis, Kevin, and Mars, previously just juvenile delinquents follow the Smith family to their hilltop mansion after Jennifer blew them off. At first just wanting to steal Smith's expensive auto, things go awry. Tommy trips the silent alarm and when one of the local officers comes to investigate, Mars kills her, setting up the hostage situation. Talley recuses himself, but ends up being forced to take charge, as it turns out that Smith works as an accountant for a mysterious criminal organization and a disc with encrypted financial information is hidden away in the mansion, so several masked men from the organization take Talley's wife and daughter hostage, compelling him to quell the situation in order for the men to somehow gain access to the mansion to get to the disc. Complicating things even further is a ""Stockholm Syndrome"" situation between Jennifer and Mars.The film is intense throughout, with Willis delivering what I believe to be arguably his best film performance. Shedding himself of the macho, smarmy, tough guy image that he essayed in the ""Die Hard"" films, as Jeff Talley in ""Hostage"", Willis plays a more vulnerable and emotional cop who wears the weight of failure in his visage. A movie like this requires more than just the typical action hero one-liners. Countering Willis' flawed hero is an equally fascinating performance by Foster as a teen sociopath who becomes obsessed with his hostage. Horn is also very good, too, as she must believably react to the awkwardness of Mars' crush on Jennifer, and she plays it just right, in my opinion. Pollak's comic timing is great, but he also does a believable job of being a man terrified for his children. But mainly Willis and Foster are the only 2 characters allowed to go deep in terms of acting. Generally, a movie like this usually isn't a draw for it's acting, but the acting really does rise above the material more often than not. Along with some great characterizations, the film's atmosphere, style, intensity, and fast pace make it an enjoyable viewing experience.",5,"Stylized, intense suspense tale",1402444800,"06 11, 2014",2014,4127,"['HOSTAGE', '2005', 'incredibly', 'stylish', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'peppered', 'cinematic', 'flourishes', 'camera', 'angles', 'long-view', 'tracking', 'shots', 'slow-mo', 'action', 'sequences', 'moody', 'music', 'Directed', 'then-newcomer', 'Florent', 'Siri', 'film', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'mainly', 'ultra-tech', 'hilltop', 'mansion', 'amazing', 'opening', 'credits', 'draws', 'immediately', 'Backed', 'pulse-pounding', 'score', 'credits', 'roll', 'anime-type', 'design', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'opening', 'film', 'sequences', 'Then', 'last', 'part', 'credits', 'craftily', 'film', 'first', 'hostage', 'confrontation', 'man', 'gone', 'edge', 'holding', 'wife', 'young', 'son', 'hostage', 'famous', 'world-weary', 'L.A.', 'negotiator', 'Jeff', 'Talley', 'film', 'protagonist', 'superbly', 'played', 'action', 'icon', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'talk', 'down', 'very', 'intense', 'disturbing', 'scene', 'Flashforward', '1', 'year', 'film', 'setting', 'small', 'California', 'town', 'where', 'Talley', 'taken', 'job', 'local', 'police', 'chief', 'order', 'run', 'away', 'past', 'failure', 'Thinking', 'major', 'crime', 'can', 'happen', 'Talley', 'content', 'live', 'out', 'days', 'here', 'wife', 'well-played', 'Serena', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'daughter', 'played', 'Rumer', 'Willis', 'who', 'Bruce', 'real-life', 'daughter', 'Talley', 'family', 'still', 'L.A.', 'town', 'wife', 'daughter', 'are', 'discontented', 'only', 'visit', 'weekends.Enter', 'other', 'film', 'major', 'players', 'Smith', 'family', 'comprised', 'Walter', 'played', 'usual', 'comic', 'aplomb', 'Kevin', 'Pollak', 'children', 'rebellious', 'teen', 'Jennifer', 'Michelle', 'Horn', 'tech-savvy', '8-year', 'old', 'Tommy', 'Jimmy', 'Bennett', 'Horn', 'Bennett', 'are', 'solid', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'being', 'convincingly', 'afraid', 'ever', 'delving', 'annoying', 'territory', 'many', 'child', 'actor', 'can', 'time', 'time', 'Rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'are', 'film', 'bad', 'guys', '3', 'malcontents', 'Kelly', 'brothers', 'Dennis', 'played', 'wide-eyed', 'jittery', 'glee', 'Jonathan', 'Tucker', 'Kevin', 'persuasively', 'played', 'Marshall', 'Allman', 'partner-in-crime', 'Mars', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'career-making', 'performance', 'Dennis', 'Kevin', 'Mars', 'previously', 'just', 'juvenile', 'delinquents', 'follow', 'Smith', 'family', 'hilltop', 'mansion', 'Jennifer', 'blew', 'off', 'first', 'just', 'wanting', 'steal', 'Smith', 'expensive', 'auto', 'things', 'go', 'awry', 'Tommy', 'silent', 'alarm', 'when', 'one', 'local', 'officers', 'investigate', 'Mars', 'setting', 'up', 'hostage', 'situation', 'Talley', 'up', 'being', 'forced', 'take', 'charge', 'out', 'Smith', 'accountant', 'mysterious', 'criminal', 'organization', 'disc', 'encrypted', 'financial', 'information', 'hidden', 'away', 'mansion', 'several', 'masked', 'men', 'organization', 'take', 'Talley', 'wife', 'daughter', 'hostage', 'compelling', 'quell', 'situation', 'order', 'men', 'somehow', 'gain', 'access', 'mansion', 'get', 'disc', 'Complicating', 'things', 'even', 'further', 'Stockholm', 'Syndrome', 'situation', 'Jennifer', 'Mars.The', 'film', 'intense', 'Willis', 'delivering', 'what', 'believe', 'be', 'arguably', 'best', 'film', 'performance', 'Shedding', 'macho', 'smarmy', 'tough', 'guy', 'image', 'essayed', 'Die', 'Hard', 'films', 'Jeff', 'Talley', 'Hostage', 'Willis', 'more', 'vulnerable', 'emotional', 'cop', 'who', 'weight', 'failure', 'visage', 'movie', 'more', 'just', 'typical', 'action', 'hero', 'one-liners', 'Countering', 'Willis', 'flawed', 'hero', 'equally', 'fascinating', 'performance', 'Foster', 'teen', 'sociopath', 'who', 'obsessed', 'hostage', 'Horn', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'too', 'must', 'believably', 'react', 'awkwardness', 'Mars', 'crush', 'Jennifer', 'just', 'right', 'opinion', 'Pollak', 'comic', 'timing', 'great', 'also', 'believable', 'job', 'being', 'man', 'terrified', 'children', 'mainly', 'Willis', 'Foster', 'are', 'only', '2', 'characters', 'allowed', 'go', 'deep', 'terms', 'acting', 'Generally', 'movie', 'usually', ""n't"", 'draw', 'acting', 'acting', 'really', 'rise', 'material', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'great', 'characterizations', 'film', 'atmosphere', 'style', 'intensity', 'fast', 'pace', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'viewing', 'experience']",N/A

His Die Hard series gave us some raucous dialogue, explosions galore, and interesting situations.Not to be outdone, Willis makes a return to the silver screen as a former hostage negotiator for the L.A.P.D named Jeff Talley. I say former because his last negotiation ended with the death of three people, a distraught hostage taker and his wife and young boy.Years later we find Chief Talley living a mundane life just outside bustling L.A. But times still haven't been that good for him. His wife is on the verge of leaving him, his daughter is rebelling, and now a new hostage situation breaks out at a wealthy man's home within Talley's jurisdiction.But, not surprising, there is much more than meets the eye...Three foolish young boys (who were just looking to steal a car) turn hostage takers within the rich man's house and find that the house can turn into a fortress (metal bars blocking entrances, surveillance cameras, etc.). And they find a safe with tons of cash in it. Why would a man keep that much money on hand?Enter the ""real"" bad guys. They want a CD that's in the house which apparently has damaging information on it related to money laundering for the mob (although this isn't spelled out, it is easily surmised). And these real bad guys kidnap Chief Talley's wife and daughter and tell him he must get that disc out of the house or his family will be killed.But inside the house are the stupid kids turned hostage takers and the rich house owner's two children (a pre-teen boy and a teenage girl). Will Talley have to sacrifice one family to save his own?************************************************************************The film is entertaining if a bit stilted. Initially no one is supposed to approach the house, but Willis' character does with ridiculous regularity.Willis' character, too, has to convince his own officers that he's doing the right thing even when it's painfully obvious he's not, which stretched credibility.The ending was flat-out lost on me, too.

In the opening scenes, he finds himself in a hostage situation where a boy ends up getting killed. Later, there's another hostage situation. In this one, a father, daughter, and son are taken hostage by 3 men who look to be in their late teens early 20's. Two of the men are half crazed and on edge. They had broke into the man's upscale home hoping to get hold of the daughter, but things go down hill for the men when the son sets off a silent alarm which immediately sends out a patrol officer. The lady police shows up and ends up getting shot by one of the men. She crawls out to the street and soon Talley arrives for backup. As soon as he makes is way to her, she dies.....now Talley is in a bad mood!!!But he will have to be patient with his vengence as the trio stumble across the home's Fort Know style security system, and click a button sending iron bars across the doors and windows and lighting up the place with flood lights.But this isn't Talley's only problem. He soon finds out that his own family has been kidnapped. What a dilemma!!! And what makes this story even more bizarre is the fact that his family's kidnappers are needing a dvd from the other family who has been kidnapped. Talk about gut wrenching!!! Now the question is, will Talley get the DVD he needs to free his family and also free the people in the other home? Well you gotta see the movie to find out cause I'm not going to tell you.I will tell you that if you like movies with a lot of action, and are in the same caliber (did I spell that right?) as Die Hard, you are sure to want this impressive film.It is filled with intense drama, intense suspense( hey that rhymes), and intense action. There's no strong sexual situations or nudity, but quite a bit of strong language, but no more than most people hear in school or at the office. If you're looking for a reviting film, get this one.As for the special features, it has a french language track, and you can put in spanish subtitles, and it's widescreen. It has other features which I personally didn't view for the fact that I'm not interested in things like how many times the actors clipped their toenails during the movie, or what the director thinks about the lighting of a particular scene. But if you're into that sort of thing, the DVD offers a Deleted scenes section with optional commentary, extended scenes with optional commentary, a behind the scenes tour and audio commentary by the director.If you do watch this film, make sure the edge of your seat is clean, because if you like extreme movies, you WILL be sitting on it.",5,INTENSE,1121299200,"07 14, 2005",2005,2690,"['Jeff', 'Talley', 'played', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'policeman', 'who', 'experience', 'field', 'hostage', 'negotiations', 'opening', 'scenes', 'hostage', 'situation', 'where', 'boy', 'up', 'getting', 'killed', 'Later', 'hostage', 'situation', 'one', 'father', 'daughter', 'son', 'are', 'taken', 'hostage', '3', 'men', 'who', 'look', 'be', 'late', 'teens', 'early', '20', 'Two', 'men', 'are', 'half', 'crazed', 'edge', 'had', 'broke', 'man', 'upscale', 'home', 'hoping', 'get', 'hold', 'daughter', 'things', 'go', 'down', 'hill', 'men', 'when', 'son', 'off', 'silent', 'alarm', 'immediately', 'out', 'patrol', 'officer', 'lady', 'police', 'up', 'up', 'getting', 'shot', 'one', 'men', 'street', 'soon', 'Talley', 'arrives', 'backup', 'As', 'soon', 'way', '..now', 'Talley', 'bad', 'mood', 'will', 'have', 'be', 'patient', 'vengence', 'trio', 'stumble', 'home', 'Fort', 'Know', 'style', 'security', 'system', 'click', 'button', 'sending', 'iron', 'bars', 'doors', 'windows', 'lighting', 'up', 'place', 'flood', 'lights.But', ""n't"", 'Talley', 'only', 'problem', 'soon', 'out', 'own', 'family', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'What', 'dilemma', 'what', 'story', 'even', 'more', 'bizarre', 'fact', 'family', 'kidnappers', 'are', 'needing', 'dvd', 'other', 'family', 'who', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'Talk', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'Now', 'question', 'will', 'Talley', 'get', 'DVD', 'free', 'family', 'also', 'free', 'people', 'other', 'home', 'Well', 'got', 'ta', 'see', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'cause', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'you.I', 'will', 'tell', 'like', 'movies', 'lot', 'action', 'are', 'same', 'caliber', 'did', 'spell', 'right', 'Die', 'Hard', 'are', 'sure', 'want', 'impressive', 'film.It', 'filled', 'intense', 'drama', 'intense', 'suspense', 'hey', 'intense', 'action', 'strong', 'sexual', 'situations', 'nudity', 'quite', 'bit', 'strong', 'language', 'more', 'most', 'people', 'hear', 'school', 'office', ""'re"", 'looking', 'reviting', 'film', 'get', 'one.As', 'special', 'features', 'french', 'language', 'track', 'can', 'put', 'spanish', 'subtitles', 'widescreen', 'other', 'features', 'personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'view', 'fact', ""'m"", 'not', 'interested', 'things', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'actors', 'clipped', 'toenails', 'movie', 'what', 'director', 'lighting', 'particular', 'scene', ""'re"", 'sort', 'thing', 'DVD', 'Deleted', 'scenes', 'section', 'optional', 'commentary', 'extended', 'scenes', 'optional', 'commentary', 'scenes', 'tour', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director.If', 'do', 'watch', 'film', 'make', 'sure', 'edge', 'seat', 'clean', 'like', 'extreme', 'movies', 'WILL', 'be', 'sitting']",N/A

Films such as ""Alien vs. Predator"" are given the PG-13 rating just in case those girls are in the mood.  The end result is of course the same as always, the vast majority of the girls that show up were dragged there by their boyfriends.  In the meantime our horror and action films are being watered down and sanitized.  And therein lies the magic of ""Hostage.""  It pulls very few punches and has given up on the 12 year old girls before the film even opens.  As a result we have a film that cracks the way an action picture should.  Blood is spilled in liberal amounts, the plot relies on its storytelling ability, and a girl who weighs more than 75 pounds is cast.  In fact, not only is she cast but is sent through the ringer in a series of overtly sexual and erotic scenes.  Helmed by Florent Siri, he knows how to work this genre even if he never rises above it.  The plot is similar to ""Panic Room"" and the first season of ""24,"" and is equal to the former but doesn't live up to the latter.  The film appears at times to take on the rich in this country, but in reality it goes soft on them.  Early on the father reminds his daughter Jennifer that wearing a skimpy dress is a sexual invitation.  However, nobody is there to point out that his mansion on a hill is an invitation to be robbed.  The film is, of course, far from flawless.  The kids are at times over vilified, the plot at times relies on huge contrivances that work in the heroes favor (cell phone anybody?), and by the time the movie is winding down it seems to have far too much on it's plate.

Truly fine script writing.This cliche behind us, Bruce launches into an absolutely rediculous hostage within a hostage story where almost nothing happens for an hour and half until he drives his truck through the house gates.  Just when you think he's gonna wrap things up...nothing happens. In a later scene with a helicopter, nothing happens either.  Instead, the focus is on how upset Bruce is, and who goes to an action picture for that?The plot, as far as I can tell has to do with comedian Kevin Pollack trying to steal a DVD from himself.  When this fails, it turns out he has the contents memorized.  None of the plot makes any sense, but it gets worse toward the end when Bruce begs Kevin not to kill his (Bruce's) family, saying ""they haven't seen your face"" but calling him by name.  Kevin had better hope Bruce's family is deaf!If the above wasn't enough, the movie really focuses in on some ugly deaths.

I wasn't sure what to expect really, it didn't get too many good reviews, but then again, it's Bruce Willis so it has to be good right?  The premise is pretty entertaining in itself, enough so that you know the movie will hold a few nail-biting scenes, and it does especially towards the end as everything starts winding down.  So heres the story.  You have Jeff (Willis) who's an x-hostage negotiator (the opening sequence shows us why he's an X) who is now working as cheif of police in a small CA town.  His wife and daughter visit on weekends and you can see his marriage is on rocky grounds...it almost appears that everyone can see that but him.  Enter our unlucky family, the ones held hostage by a group of teenage boys who wanted their car, but in the process someone gets shot and another gets knocked out and pretty soon the young boys get thrown into panic mode as the take the two children of the house hostage and close themselves into the house using the servalence system.  The only problem (at least for Willis) is that these boys took the wrong mad hostage.  he's an acountant (innocent enough) and he has connections with organized crime (not so innocent) and these crime lords need a disk that this man has encrypted for them.  The catch here is if Jeff doesn't hold the cops off and keep everyone inside the house until these crime lords get into the house to get there disk then Jeff's family will die.  He's got some choices to make.  If he goes inside the house to save the family, his own may die, and if he stays outside the house to protect his own family then the innocent children in the house may die.  It's a catch 22.  Scene stealer Ben Foster does an outstanding job portraying a pshycopath.  He just LOOKED insane, and the whole 'burn it' scene (When you watch you'll know what I mean) is just crazy...the most intence part of the film...All in all it was an impressive film.

904300,AILBDL6ATVDCJ,B0009ETCUQ,"Dan Blankenship ""Author of THE RUNNING GIRL""","[5, 6]","As with all of my reviews, I must say that I was not particularly fond of how often the ""F"" word was used in this film.  I think movie-makers get carried away with using profanity to make it all seem a bit more real.  But besides that one complaint, I think this movie is a thrill-a-minute ride that most people will enjoy. HOSTAGE delivers suspense, shock, and surprises throughout the entire film.Bruce Willis is excellent as the former hostage negotiator turned small town police chief.  His character ends up being drawn back into the role of negotiator, and Willis delivers the dialogue, the action, and the drama like only he can.  This is now my favorite Bruce Willis movie.  I think the originality of the script, combined with an awesome cast of actors and actresses made Willis shine more than in his past work.Kevin Pollak plays Walter Smith, a book-cooker with a high-tech DVD collection that adds a bit more saga to Bruce's unusually ""bad"" day.  Pollak's banter with his son and daughter sounded like the scriptwriter has been taping conversations in my living room!Jimmy Bennett (III) is Tommy Smith, a kid with some brain power...so much so that when he is asked by Willis to retrieve the ""Heaven Can Wait"" DVD, he thinks to look and see if there is more than one version of the film!  Now that's a smart kid.  Most adults don't even know there are two ""Heaven Can Wait"" movies.  Seriously though, this Jimmy Bennett kid, he's good.  I was actually yelling for him to crawl faster when the evil Mars was after him.  I think this kid has a bright future in Hollywood.This is without a doubt Michelle Horn's best work to date!  She gave Bruce a run for his money in this movie, nearly stealing the show.  I cannot say enough about her performance as Jennifer Smith; she had the drama, the tension, the fear, the...oh just insert every emotion one can display here ___________!  I said I think Jimmy Bennett has a bright future.  Well I KNOW Michelle Horn has bright past, present, and future.  This film should make her a superstar as far as I'm concerned.  If she pulled this off with such perfection, I don't think there is a role she couldn't pull off.Ben Foster plays the weird and completely insane Mars Krupcheck, a character that gave me the creeps!  Mars is evil through and through, and I think one of the things that makes HOSTAGE such a good movie is that Mars so personifies evil, while Tommy and Jennifer Smith represent innocence and purity - the clash of the two opposites creating such a clear view of evil and good that we tend to forget exist.Jonathan Tucker is a little weak in his performance as Mars's accomplice, Dennis Kelly.  It may have just been the script, not sure. Marshall Allman tries his best to make his character, Kevin Kelly, work, but it just wasn't his best performance.  Again, it may have just been the script.All of that about sums up what I thought about the movie and the performances.  This is a movie that provides the viewer with a great plot, a whole lot of action, some suspenseful moments, and a few unexpected twists.  I do not think young kids should watch this movie at all.  No one younger than thirteen should watch HOSTAGE, and I must once again say that I think the amount of profanity was a bit over the top, however, this is a movie about good and evil, so evil shouldn't be watered down too much.See ya next review!",5,Wow!

For this accountant has some very desperate clients, who don't mind sacrificing the hostages in order to get something they want that's inside the house.Stuck in the middle is Jeff Talley (Bruce Willis), a suburban police chief (and, coincidently enough, a former police negotiator), whose own family has been taken hostage by the accountant's mysterious client.  With the help of the accountant's son (a credible, if a bit over-the-top, performance by young Jimmy Bennett), Talley must work to satisfy TWO parties of murderers...before time runs out.  Because (of course) there is a clock ticking away...Fortunately, this film will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Willis gives one of his best performances in years (I'd almost given up on him), Pollak is enjoyable to watch as always, and the other performances are at least tolerable.  But of course, the thing that draws attention to a film like this is the tension...and there's a lot of it.  ""Hostage"" is one of the most suspenseful movies I've seen in a while.

904303,A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,B0009ETCUQ,"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL""","[3, 3]","Hostage represents Bruce Willis' latest attempt to produce a thriller with the kind of broad appeal exhibited by his most successful big-screen endeavor, Die Hard. The largest potential drawback to enjoying this movie is getting past some of the plot's implausibilities. For those who manage to achieve this, Hostage offers two entertaining hours. Or, to put it another way: accept Hostage for what it is, and a flawed-but-enjoyable ride awaits. I never once glanced at my watch.Willis plays top LAPD hostage negotiator Jeff Talley, who removes himself from the big city after two victims (including a child) are killed on his watch. A year later, he is the chief of police in Bristo Camino, a small Ventura County hamlet. Nothing much happens there, which suits Jeff fine. His biggest worry is dealing with the unhappiness of his wife, Jane (Serena Scott Thomas), and daughter, Amanda (Rumer Willis, Bruce's real-life daughter with Demi Moore). They dislike Jeff's new lifestyle so much that they only live with him part-time, and ""part-time"" is even too often for Amanda. Then, when a suspicious vehicle is spotted outside the gated house of an accountant (Kevin Pollack), everything changes.Inside the house, the accountant is lying motionless on his living room floor while his daughter, Jennifer (Michelle Horn), and son, Tommy (Jimmy Bennett), are being held hostage by three interlopers: Dennis (Jonathan Tucker), Mars (Ben Foster), and Kevin (Marshall Allman). An investigating police officer is shot and killed - an event that brings the entire Bristo Camino police force on the scene, plus a lot of help from the outside. After handling the initial contact with the hostage-takers, Jeff willingly turns over reigns of authority - until he discovers that there are darker goings-on than the crisis at hand.The secondary plot-thread bogs down Hostage a little. While this aspect of the film amps up the tension, it does so at the expense of credibility and drama. Hostage tries to give us access to the interaction between the three inexperienced criminals (none of whom trust one another) and their victims, but it is shortchanged. Also, the final showdown is a little disappointing in its ordinariness. But there are some nice elements. For example, Tommy is played as an ingenious boy (not the stock dullard of movies like this) who provides a stream of useful information to Jeff via cell phone calls. And a dog gets whacked, which almost never happens in major motion pictures.Although understandable, comparisons to Die Hard are misplaced. Hostage is a different kind of movie, and Jeff is nothing like John McClane. This character isn't a wisecracking fly in the ointment, he's a tortured individual looking for redemption. Jeff is an interesting enough individual that a drama could have been constructed around his life if the thriller elements hadn't intervened.Director Florent Siri has burst upon the North American scene with a flourish. His sense of scope is impressive - he is fond of tracking and aerial shots. There's one scene in which the perspective changes from one car to another at an intersection, then switches to a third car as the second one passes it on the road. This is done seamlessly, giving us a sense that the lives of the characters are intersecting before the main action begins.Hostage works in much the same way that Assault on Precinct 13 succeeds. Once the viewer has become immersed in the film's world, it no longer matters that real-world conventions are being flouted. Hostage has suspense and momentum, it takes some chances (the murder of a child during the prologue indicates that the film isn't squeamish), and, in Mars, it has a creepy villain (who appears to be designed, at least to a degree, using the mindset of the Columbine killers). The climax, while conclusive, offers little in the way of a true catharsis, but that's in keeping with the overall downbeat tone. Hostage works on its own terms, and, if you're willing to accept them, you'll enjoy spending these two hours with Bruce Willis.",4,Hostage (DVD),1142121600,"03 12, 2006",2006,4054,"['Hostage', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'latest', 'attempt', 'produce', 'thriller', 'kind', 'broad', 'appeal', 'exhibited', 'most', 'successful', 'big-screen', 'endeavor', 'Die', 'Hard', 'largest', 'potential', 'drawback', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'getting', 'plot', 'implausibilities', 'who', 'manage', 'achieve', 'Hostage', 'two', 'entertaining', 'hours', 'put', 'way', 'accept', 'Hostage', 'what', 'flawed-but-enjoyable', 'ride', 'awaits', 'never', 'once', 'glanced', 'watch.Willis', 'top', 'LAPD', 'hostage', 'negotiator', 'Jeff', 'Talley', 'who', 'big', 'city', 'two', 'victims', 'including', 'child', 'are', 'killed', 'watch', 'year', 'later', 'chief', 'police', 'Bristo', 'Camino', 'small', 'Ventura', 'County', 'hamlet', 'Nothing', 'much', 'there', 'suits', 'Jeff', 'fine', 'biggest', 'worry', 'dealing', 'unhappiness', 'wife', 'Jane', 'Serena', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'daughter', 'Amanda', 'Rumer', 'Willis', 'Bruce', 'real-life', 'daughter', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'dislike', 'Jeff', 'new', 'lifestyle', 'so', 'much', 'only', 'live', 'part-time', 'part-time', 'even', 'too', 'often', 'Amanda', 'Then', 'when', 'suspicious', 'vehicle', 'spotted', 'gated', 'house', 'accountant', 'Kevin', 'Pollack', 'everything', 'changes.Inside', 'house', 'accountant', 'lying', 'motionless', 'living', 'room', 'floor', 'daughter', 'Jennifer', 'Michelle', 'Horn', 'son', 'Tommy', 'Jimmy', 'Bennett', 'are', 'being', 'held', 'hostage', 'three', 'interlopers', 'Dennis', 'Jonathan', 'Tucker', 'Mars', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'Kevin', 'Marshall', 'Allman', 'investigating', 'police', 'officer', 'shot', 'killed', 'event', 'entire', 'Bristo', 'Camino', 'police', 'force', 'scene', 'lot', 'help', 'outside', 'handling', 'initial', 'contact', 'hostage-takers', 'Jeff', 'willingly', 'over', 'reigns', 'authority', 'are', 'darker', 'goings-on', 'crisis', 'hand.The', 'secondary', 'plot-thread', 'bogs', 'down', 'Hostage', 'little', 'aspect', 'film', 'up', 'tension', 'so', 'expense', 'credibility', 'drama', 'Hostage', 'give', 'access', 'interaction', 'three', 'inexperienced', 'criminals', 'none', 'whom', 'trust', 'one', 'victims', 'shortchanged', 'Also', 'final', 'showdown', 'little', 'disappointing', 'ordinariness', 'are', 'nice', 'elements', 'example', 'Tommy', 'played', 'ingenious', 'boy', 'not', 'stock', 'dullard', 'movies', 'who', 'stream', 'useful', 'information', 'Jeff', 'cell', 'phone', 'dog', 'whacked', 'almost', 'never', 'major', 'motion', 'understandable', 'comparisons', 'Die', 'Hard', 'are', 'misplaced', 'Hostage', 'different', 'kind', 'movie', 'Jeff', 'nothing', 'John', 'McClane', 'character', ""n't"", 'wisecracking', 'fly', 'ointment', 'tortured', 'individual', 'looking', 'redemption', 'Jeff', 'interesting', 'enough', 'individual', 'drama', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'constructed', 'life', 'thriller', 'elements', 'had', ""n't"", 'intervened.Director', 'Florent', 'Siri', 'burst', 'North', 'American', 'scene', 'flourish', 'sense', 'scope', 'impressive', 'fond', 'tracking', 'aerial', 'shots', 'one', 'scene', 'perspective', 'changes', 'one', 'car', 'intersection', 'then', 'third', 'car', 'second', 'one', 'road', 'done', 'seamlessly', 'giving', 'sense', 'lives', 'characters', 'are', 'intersecting', 'main', 'action', 'begins.Hostage', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Assault', 'Precinct', '13', 'viewer', 'become', 'immersed', 'film', 'world', 'no', 'longer', 'matters', 'real-world', 'conventions', 'are', 'being', 'flouted', 'Hostage', 'suspense', 'momentum', 'chances', 'murder', 'child', 'prologue', 'film', ""n't"", 'squeamish', 'Mars', 'creepy', 'villain', 'who', 'be', 'designed', 'least', 'degree', 'using', 'mindset', 'Columbine', 'killers', 'climax', 'conclusive', 'little', 'way', 'true', 'catharsis', 'keeping', 'overall', 'downbeat', 'tone', 'Hostage', 'own', 'terms', ""'re"", 'willing', 'accept', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'spending', 'two', 'hours', 'Bruce', 'Willis']",N/A

(I direct readers to his far more substantialMercury Rising, see my review.)Here the Bruce plays a small California town police chief, a former S.W.A.T. man and 'failed' negotiator. Two silly plots--a horrid home invasion and the kidnapping of his family--leave Bruce gasping, bugging his eyes beautifully and acting extremely well. Aside from that, it struck me this was Willis' great acting vehicle.It makes me wonder now if he thought the old career was dying. There is a strong bid for sympathy and attention by his character, though Willis has his trademarks to respect: tough, silent, suffering alone. He reminds me of a sad mix of John Wayne and Steven Seagal. That, in the end, is what we want Willis to do. What was most odd is the real scene-stealer is a small cute boy, anxious to save his family and instrumental in foiling the baddies.What is it with Willis using kids as props?There is lots of action and bullets whizzing here--just be advised, in spite of the stupid PG rating I've seen given to this, it should have been rated R.

In the opening sequence, Jeff Talley (Willis) waves off a SWAT sniper from killing a would-be assassin, while raising a sign stating, ""No one dies today"". Well someone forgot to inform the killer, because moments later the killer, the killer's wife and kid were all dead. Oooops......Flash forward one year later. Talley is now the chief of police in the hick town of Bristo Camino, CA. He is separated form his wife, but they still meet for weekends. He has issues with his teenage daughter. Talley's life to this point really sucks. But wait there's more.Three high-school dropout stoners are casing possible car jack-able vehicles, when one of them recognizes a fellow student riding with her family in an Escalade. Bingo! The three punks follow their prize home, only to have the silent alarm on the house tripped, while they're in the middle of their heist. This in turn, sets up another hostage situation. (Did we have any doubts?)Talley, however, after reporting to the scene of the crime upon receiving reports of an officer being down; turns jurisdiction over to the state authorities. Only after Talley receives a phone call for one of the hostage victims, and has his family kidnapped; does he return to the scene of the crime to negotiate for the victim's freedom.In a completely unrelated storyline, Kevin Pollack (the hostage family's father) is an accountant for some underworld organization (i.e. drug lords, dirty cops, etc.). Who these people are is never revealed to the audience. However, he has encrypted the entire underworld banking information onto a ""Heaven Can Wait"" disc, which is located within the confines of the house. The house which is now surrounded by cops, television camera, etc. Talley's family has been kidnapped by the underworld villains in order to motivate Talley (Willis) to retrieve this banking disc from the house; without anyone else finding out.There are several loose ends in this film that are foreshadowed, but never come into play. For example, the movie makes a point to introduce two ""Heaven Can Wait"" DVD boxes; however, neither comes into play. Talley negotiates to keep $1 million dollars of the accountant's money for himself; again, it doesn't come into play. Lastly, who is this villainous group seeking the banking disc? With the way the film ended, doesn't anyone fear that they might be back?Anyways, this is definitely a film worth waiting for. I bought this movie on a disc with four others, all for the low, low price of $5.

I enjoyed it, somewhat, but it was just too far fetched to totally win me over. Plus the story had too many plots and sub-plots and in places it was hard to separate the good guys from the bad guys. However, it certainly had a lot of fast action, death and destruction. Strangely, although it had credibility problems, it held the attention.Hmmm. The plot is so convoluted, I don't know where to start. Let's begin with some tough punks in an aging pickup truck making crude gestures to a teen-aged young lady riding in a Cadillac Escalade. She rudely flips them off and they follow her to an isolated multi-million dollar, ultra-modern home. Leaving their truck out of sight, they break into the house and encounter the father and his two children. The young boy manages to set off a silent alarm and, before long, a policewoman is at the door. At this point, one of the punks panics and pumps a couple bullets into her. Well, shortly thereafter, our hero Bruce Willis enters the scene as the Police Chief of the small California town and in no time at all we have a hostage situation. Now, that might make a pretty good movie in itself, but wait, the plot thickens. Willis backs out of the fray and allows the better-equipped and better-staffed county Sheriff's Office to take over. It made sense, although remember, this is a Bruce Willis movie. Well, the unfolding scene attracted the attention of the ""mob."" It seems that the father, the one being held hostage, had an important and incriminating DVD and the mob wanted it back so that it wouldn't get into the hands of the police. Well, since they thought our hero Bruce Willis was in charge, they kidnapped Willis' wife and  child and threatened to kill them unless they got their DVD back. Well, then we had a double hostage situation with Willis having to fight to regain control of the investigation in order to get the DVD back and to rescue his own family, let alone the original hostages. Perhaps at this point, I should mention that the FBI, upon getting wind of the whole thing, stepped in and took over everything. Uh, well, that's enough. My head is spinning. Go see the movie and keep your own scorecard.""Hostage"" is a well-produced, action-packed movie and well worth viewing. The acting is fairly good. The filming is excellent. The pace moves along nicely. My main criticism is that the plot is way to convoluted and has major credibility problems.

904316,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0009ETCUQ,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","HOSTAGE, based on the best-selling novel by Robert Crais and adapted for the screen by Doug Richardson, has all the right ingredients for an action thriller: good plot, good character motivation, the requisite battle between good and evil, the transformation of a past bad deed into a current good turn, pyrotechniques, good sets, good actors.  What more could you ask for a movie in this genre? Editing!Jeff Talley (Bruce Willis looking far better sans hair than in the overly hirsute opening scenes) is a hostage negotiator in Los Angeles and after a traumatic event, transfers his family to a little Ventura County town.  The job as Chief of Police of the quiet burg seems boring until the day of the movie when three punk teenagers (Ben Foster, Jonathan Tucker, Marshall Allman) respond to their testosterone and antisocial tendencies and decide to steal an Escalade SUV from rich man  Walter Smith (Kevin Pollak) and his children Jennifer (Michelle Horn) and Tommy (Jimmy Bennett) who live in a superstructure, highly guarded mansion that serves as a headquarters for criminal money manipulation (unbeknownst to the perpetrators).  What begins as a 'simple robbery' escalates into a heinous situation that even Talley feels he cannot handle.  The teen trio holds the family hostage, requesting a helicopter to aid their escape.  Memories and flashbacks to Talley's Los Angeles fiasco drive him to superhero deeds in the messy situation and through a series of truly interesting twists this cat and mouse game of death comes to an interesting end.Yes, there are subplots galore, deaths, fire, explosions, death-defying actions, and unexpected turns of events - all of which propel the breakneck speed of this film under the direction of Florent Emilio Siri.  But clocking in at 113 minutes feels like 90 minutes could have accomplished the same results with more intensity.  Bruce Willis is Bruce Willis and few can carry off these flicks as well.  The supporting cast is fine with a special nod to Ben Foster who seems made to play the creepy teenaged protocriminal.  One wonders why the producers elected to select brilliant composer Alexandre Desplat ('Birth', 'Girl with the Pearl Earring', 'The Upside of Anger', etc) to create a score that is 1) buried by all of the onscreen noise and 2) gratefully so!  In all the film, with a lot of editing, could rank up there with the best of them in this genre.  As it is, it is pretty solid 'entertainment.'

The plot is very complex and you might be confused at times but, you have to show patience to understand it. The movie starts with my man Bruce with a nice hair due while he is a negotiator. But when things go awry and the hostages get killed, one a child, Bruce Willis's character named Jeff Talley quits the force and becomes hief of police in a very small town. This is a change from big Los Angeles. He's married, and has a daughter there. But, just when he thinks that things are going to be very calm, it ends up being very hectic. When three young punks break into a large mansion and when one of them kills a cop and shoots at other cops, there's a situation. Inside the giant mansion, there's one man with two children. The mansion alone is neat to observe as it's so big and has so many hidden places. It's absolutely gorgeous and that alone is amazing. But, Jeff Talley is the guy in charge and he negotiates with the 3 guys that have broken into the house.But, things get worse for Jeff when mysterious men inform him that they'll execute his wife and child if he doesn't retrieve a disc from the mansion in which unfortunately 3 intruders are already in.

904322,A7PZZXJJZM4N2,B0009ETCUQ,Isaac,"[11, 12]","""Hostage"" is a well-written, well-acted, and well-made thriller that hosts the return of Bruce Willis to his true action-thriller roots. It is also a warm-up exercise for the veteran, who announced a week before the film's theatrical release that he has every intention of returning for a fourth ""Die Hard"" installment. Whether or not he will follow through on this, he reminds us in this movie that he is still at the top of his game. And when, may I ask, will the bad guys learn that you just don't mess around with Bruce Willis?One year after negotiating a hostage situation that ended in tragedy, Jeff Talley (Bruce Willis) is the chief of police in Ventura County, California. His marriage with Jane (Serena Scott Thomas) is on the rocks, he is at odds with his daughter Amanda (Willis` real-life daughter, Rumer Willis), and, as would be expected, the past is haunting him mercilessly. Talley is having trouble coping with not being able to save a little boy's life, which is why he retired from being a negotiator and took a less stressful job.What begins as a ""low crime Monday"" in Talley's quiet town turns into a nightmare when a trio of troublesome teenagers--comprised of brothers Dennis and Kevin (Jonathan Tucker and Marshall Allman) and their buddy Mars (Ben Foster)--invade the highly secured mountaintop mansion of wealthy accountant Walter Smith (Kevin Pollak). The punks have the simple intention of stealing Walter's Escalade, but when a silent alarm is tripped and an investigating police officer is shot, they take Walter, his teenage daughter Jennifer (Michelle Horn), and his young son Tommy (Jimmy Bennett) hostage.Talley arrives on the scene with backup and finds himself talking to Dennis, but having lost one officer already motivates him to turn authority over to the county police. However, Talley is stopped by a second group of villains--unaffiliated with Dennis, Kevin, and Mars--who have taken his wife and daughter hostage. He is instructed by their masked leader to return to the house and retrieve a cryptic DVD or his family will die. This plot device is completely brilliant. It takes ""Hostage"" out of the usual atmosphere of its genre, giving it a grand and gallant complexity that saves it from being typical.Its a bizarre coincidence that three teenage punks unwittingly interfere with the plans of professional criminals. Bizarre, too, is the film's suggestion that Tommy can break his sister's glass bong, slice his hand, cut through tape that is binding his wrists, and squirm his way through the roomy crawl space of the house. The film also expects us to believe that air ducts are spacious enough to crawl through, but without this, a key chase scene would not be possible.When the three teenagers are inside and figure out how to activate the mansion's safeguards, it seems nearly impossible for Talley to penetrate the house and retrieve the DVD. Dennis is the voice of the group and, assumingly, the man in charge, while his kid brother Kevin is more passive and conscientious. Mars (a brilliant performance by Ben Foster) is a shadowy customer, who lingers among Dennis and Kevin with sinister instinct and develops a lustful obsession with Jennifer.As the second hour of the film unfolds, we begin to study the changing persona of Talley. What really motivates him? Viewers will be debating this with their friends on the ride home from the theater. Is he trying to save the Smith family or his own? Upon escaping, little Tommy manages to contact Talley, and Talley is willing to put Tommy in jeopardy so that he can retrieve what the masked men want. On this side of the argument, the Smiths are disposable. But later, during one of the film's many thrilling instances, Talley is suddenly obliged to save the Smiths, determined not to relive the crisis that he experienced one year ago. Through this and many other moments, including a touching scene where Talley gives a video game analogy of the situation to Tommy, Bruce Willis proves that he is still a strong actor who doesn't settle for giving one hundred percent.What drives ""Hostage'' is a screenplay populated with emotion and moments of overwhelming intensity. It also initiates moments of abrupt graphic violence and unexpected deaths, in which we come to realize that the situation is more serious and brutal than it appears to be. The screenplay is driven by characters who are portrayed with skill. The beautiful and talented Michelle Horn succeeds with Jennifer; the cute and lovable Jimmy Bennett is already a pro; Jonathan Tucker and Marshall Allman mix guilt and innocence with their respective characters. But it is Ben Foster who steals the show as Mars, who, along with Kiefer Sutherland`s caller in ""Phone Booth,"" is one of the best movie villains in recent years. The cold-heartedness and psychosis that Foster brings to his character is likely to have him typecast for the majority of his career.However routine and cliched the film may be, director Florent Siri ensures that everything be spellbinding, and what results is an exciting, suspenseful thriller. The house that a majority of the film takes place in exists as a remarkable set piece and, much like the panic room from David Koepp's 2002 film, is a character in the film in a lot of ways. You even start to wonder if the house has a mind of its own, because after the thirty minute mark, you can tell that the film does.Rated R; 113 minutes; Directed by Florent Emilio

Now he has a chance to redeem himself by saving one family taken hostage -  while also trying to keep his own family out of danger from other bad guys.If you watch every action film that comes along, good or bad, you'll probably go to this one.

I think the film is getting rated bad because people who love Die Hard see Bruce Willis in this and start comparing the films. I know this from hearing people in the theatre actually saying the movie is ok but it's no Die Hard. The film to me is perfect from the story to the action, there's not too much action but it's just right. Even better there was the birth and death of a unsuspected and excellent villain in Ben Foster.It starts out with the usual, a hostage negotiator (Bruce Willis) fail to save the life of innocent people and then he retires but not totally because he moves on to lead a small town police department. Next you are introduced to your nut cases Ben Foster (Mars) and Jonathan Tucker (Dennis) and his brother. Both Mars are and Dennis mad at the world because they have no money and feel like outcasts. So they play the outlaw roles and steal some stuff but what Dennis doesn't know is his little friend Mars whom he just met not even 3 weeks ago is a blood-craving psycho that goes way beyond just being a thief.The two gain interest in a girl who has a rich father and decide to follow her family to their house but they didn't know her father is in business with some crazy guys that want something in the house the girl's father owes them. The film gets crazy because there isn't just one problem there's a bunch of them. Ben Foster was great because he develops his character into an amazing villain and it seemed like he couldn't be stopped. Willis goes to war to get what he wants and loves and fights to the very end. I thought it was a great movie not only to blow off some time but it's something you don't want to miss for the wild plot twists. Also this is a very violent movie so if you have a slightly weak stomach it may start to get to you.",5,A Movie That Holds Nothing Back,1138320000,"01 27, 2006",2006,1862,"['Hostage', 'out', 'great', 'what', 'even', 'better', 'ended', 'same', 'way', 'think', 'film', 'getting', 'rated', 'bad', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'Die', 'Hard', 'see', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'start', 'comparing', 'films', 'know', 'hearing', 'people', 'theatre', 'actually', 'saying', 'movie', 'ok', 'Die', 'Hard', 'film', 'perfect', 'story', 'action', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'action', 'just', 'right', 'Even', 'better', 'was', 'birth', 'death', 'unsuspected', 'excellent', 'villain', 'Ben', 'Foster.It', 'out', 'usual', 'hostage', 'negotiator', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'fail', 'save', 'life', 'innocent', 'people', 'then', 'not', 'totally', 'lead', 'small', 'town', 'police', 'department', 'are', 'introduced', 'nut', 'cases', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'Mars', 'Jonathan', 'Tucker', 'Dennis', 'brother', 'Mars', 'are', 'Dennis', 'mad', 'world', 'have', 'money', 'feel', 'outcasts', 'play', 'outlaw', 'roles', 'steal', 'stuff', 'what', 'Dennis', ""n't"", 'know', 'little', 'friend', 'Mars', 'whom', 'just', 'met', 'not', 'even', '3', 'weeks', 'ago', 'blood-craving', 'psycho', 'way', 'just', 'being', 'thief.The', 'two', 'gain', 'interest', 'girl', 'who', 'rich', 'father', 'decide', 'follow', 'family', 'house', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'father', 'business', 'crazy', 'guys', 'want', 'something', 'house', 'girl', 'father', 'film', 'crazy', ""n't"", 'just', 'one', 'problem', 'bunch', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'was', 'great', 'character', 'amazing', 'villain', 'seemed', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'stopped', 'Willis', 'war', 'get', 'what', 'loves', 'fights', 'very', 'end', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'blow', 'off', 'time', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'wild', 'plot', 'twists', 'Also', 'very', 'violent', 'movie', 'so', 'have', 'slightly', 'weak', 'stomach', 'may', 'start', 'get']",N/A

I like Robert Crais' novels, but when they get filmed all the life goes out of them and the coincidences seem to assume huge, blatant outlines, as though highlighted by Sharpies.  Bruce Willis is fine as the hostage specialist who burns out after one excruciating standoff during which a child hostage gets killed.  Of course you know that, years later, and still haunted by his failure, and even though he's moved himself miles and miles from any stressful urban situations, somehow he's going to find himself right back in the thick of another, even worse, hostage crisis.  In this kind of picture, that's part of the formula.  ""Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!""The problem is that all the children in the movie, and the young people in general, are terrible at acting.  I know there are good young actors out there.  I know this in my heart, just as I know that Rumer Willis is not one of them!  Wooden isn't the word.  She's heroic the same way Sofia Coppola was in The Godfather III.  Rumer plays Bruce's rebellious daughter in this one, not a stretch you might think but she looks like she's suffering the tortures of the damned.  And she spends most of the movie in bondage as it happens, gee thanks Dad.  Yet she's Sarah Bernhardt compared to the three punks who take a suburban mansion hostage, and the brother and sister they imprison.  They are all terrible and nearly ruin the show.  Ben Foster, sometimes very good, here sinks his own career with a series of acting ""decisions"" which belong in the Clunker Hall of Fame.  If he lives another three or four years, he will look back on this, the folly of his youth, with fists rubbing his eyes, as though he can't believe he was the same person.  A twelve step program might help, but is there one for ""Ham Anonymous""?Now all the Ben Foster fanboys and girls will come down on me like the plague Hilary Swank fights in THE REAPING, but the truth is the truth and what Ben Foster does here is an insult to the very reels of film that captured his performance in.It was nice to see Serena Scott Thomas as Bruce Willis's wife.  If her casting follows its usual pattern, they must have offered the script to her sister, Kristin Scott Thomas, who then shuddered and rolled it sideways and sent it whooshing down the pneumatic tube to sister Serena.

That is, until a group of teens break into the home of a rich family and take the father and children hostage after a failed attempt to steal the family's Cadillac Escalade.

904336,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0009ETCUQ,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[12, 15]","To be a hostage induces an dreadful experience to those under circumstances where the choice of options have ceased  to exist.  The only choice is to live under the constant observation of another party who controls everything within the area in which they confine the hostage.  In order to prevent a deadly outcome in a stand-off with law enforcement the police have negotiators that communicate, usually over the phone, directly with the person in charge.  The negotiator communicates with the hostage taker in order to gain ground and information in regards to the situation while trying to solve the issue in a peaceful manner.  Jeff Talley (Bruce Willis) is negotiator who desires nothing else than to solve hostage situations peacefully, but it has taken it's toll on his life including his relationship with his wife and daughter.  Consequently, Jeff has taken the job as a small town sheriff where he enjoys counting the peaceful days in contrasts to the violence of Los Angeles.Hostage, directed by Florent Emilio Siri, has an interesting display of the opening credits through a vignette portraying the city of Los Angeles in black and gray while the sky is crimson red.  This suggestively induces a notion of darkness and despair that suddenly cuts into a hostage situation where an extremely disturbed man has taken a woman and her son hostage who is also screaming out his demands over a phone.  On the other side of the line rests Jeff on his back under the scorching L.A. sun located on top of a parking garage talking to the hostage taker with the cool calmness of a kindergarten teacher.  During his conversation with the hostage taker the S.W.A.T. team informs him that they are ready to strike, but he holds them back.  However, the situation begins to slip Jeff's grip and it is the violence of these working conditions that makes Jeff seek relocation in a more serene community.The relocation takes its toll on his family.  His daughter thinks they are getting a divorce while she feels the tension between her mom and dad.  Jeff's wife even complains that she does not know what is going on, as Jeff keeps everything bottled up inside and does not share his thoughts or feelings. Yet, the job has its benefits compared to his previous job.  It is a safer and more peaceful job for Jeff, as his biggest problem is speeding and maintaining the dress code among the police officers.  However, somewhere in this low-crime background a dark and more sinister situation is about to boil into a deadly stand-off with the local police force.  Three teenagers decide on trying to steal a luxury SUV from a richer family, but something goes wrong and the three adolescents become hostage takers.Initially, it all seems like an ordinary break-in that went wrong and led the hostage situation to Jeff, but when some other factors come into play he finds himself being a hostage.  His position turns into a race against time and the other police officers in charge at the lavish mountain top home where the hostages reside.  It is crucial that Jeff remain cool and collected while trying to find an answer to his tough situation which calls for extreme measures.  However, he cannot plan for the unexpected elements that might occur in a highly stressful circumstance and how it might affect others in this situation.From the opening credits until the end of the film viewers will most likely sit glued to the edge of their seat.  The story is highly engaging and it throws several different ideas at the audience to make the situation captivating, and it does so with much success.  There are however, some elements in the story that feel awkward and far-fetched, yet somehow Florent Emilio Siri keeps the audience's attention until the very end.

When compared to action/thrillers as a whole, Hostage is your average Bruce Willis action/thriller flick that is fun throughout, but nothing too memorable. I left the theater feeling satisfied, but I wasn't jumping for joy because I just saw the best action/thriller of my life exactly.Bruce Willis plays hostage negotiator Jeff Talley who after witnessing a gruesome death of a child in a hostage situation gone bad, moves with his family out of Los Angeles to a smaller Californian town to work as chief of police. But he is soon dragged back into the hostage game when a car-jacking gets out of hand when 3 teenagers break into a mansion to try and steal an Escalade. The plot thickens later as we find out that the three teenagers have barracaded themselves in with something much more above themselves that a well funded group of organized criminals will do absolutely anything to get back. I don't want to say too much but that is basically the premise behind Hostage.Like I said before, Hostage is a decent flick with an interestingly enough premise behind it to make it watchable. There's also a few tense moments in it to make an okay thriller. Also, the characters were played finely and with depth. It was just that it wasn't a breath of fresh air or anything in this genre and it was a bit predictable.. I recommend that you wait for video, but if you're a fan of films like The Negotiator or Panic Room, you might want to check this one out sooner.

It's not as if Willis hadn't tried this role before, it was just that ""Color of Night"" was roundly and justly panned. So much so that I'm surprised Willis agreed to take the role that got him recognised as a dramatic actor. Since his role in ""Sixth Sense"" we have been forced to witness Willis's progressively less successful transformation from brawny action-star to almost a wuss. (There is no better word, believe me, I tried several and it pains me to use the one I chose.)With ""Hostage""Bruce is back in all of his tough-guy glory. Even more surprising is that he is also part-psychologist, giving us the best of both worlds. ""Hostage"" is a very entertaining film that delivers exactly what it promises. It's all the best action-film ingredients, right down to the bad guy who just won't die. Sure, there are films that make better use of some of ""Hostage""'s key elements such as ""The Negoitator"" and to a far lesser extent, ""Panic Room.""

904344,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0009ETCUQ,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[32, 40]","Going into this film you should know that ""Hostage"" is an over the top sort of film.  Based on the novel of the same name by Robert Crais, this 2005 release finds that one hostage drama is not enough, there needs to be two hostage dramas going on at the same time just to make things even more complicated.  Then it decides that the hero should be burdened with guilt over a previous hostage situation that goes wrong.  On the one hand this makes the scenario pretty unbelievable, but on the other hand you get to the point where you are wondering how they are going to get to the requisite happy ending so you will be hard pressed to call ""Hostage"" predictable.  That being the greatest Hollywood sin, I am willing to forgive this film its faults.The prologue finds Jeff Talley (Bruce Willis), with long hair and a long beard, dealing with a hostage situation in L.A.  His goal is to make sure that nobody dies that die, but that does not happen.  A year later Talley is the chief of police in Bristo Camino in Ventura County.  His wife (Serena Scott Thomas) and daughter (Rumer Willis) are still living in the city and come out to visit on weekends.  The daughter is not speaking to her father, apparently worried her parents are going to get divorced and unable to understand why daddy wants the relative peace and quiet of the sticks.  But like Willis' most famous screen incarnation, John McClane of the ""Die Hard"" flicks, the rule of irony applies and his biggest nightmare shows up in town.Three young punks are sitting in a stolen pick-up truck ogling a young girl who flips them off before getting back into her daddy's SUV.  They decide to follow the family home and when they discover a beautiful home nestled in the hills outside of town they decide to break in and push the family around.  The thing we know somebody is dead and Talley arrives on the scene to be greeted by a hail of bullets.  The Smith family ends up being held hostage by these three punks and when the County Sheriff shows up Talley is perfectly happy to turn over command and walk away.  However, there is an interested third party to the hostage situation who insists that Talley resume command and do everything in his power, not to make sure that everybody gets out alive, but that a certain computer disc is retrieved.Again, this is a totally unbelievable situation, but it is not boring.  You either buy into the scenario and go along for the ride or you do not.  My only question is whether the red herring I picked up on to no good end whatsoever was intentional or an uncorrupted mistook.  That and why the title credits look like a dry run for ""Sin City"" and also have no discernable payoff in the film.  The most interesting character in the film ends up being Mars (Ben Foster), the trigger happy one of the punks who had be scared because I kept thinking at some point he would realize that the young girl he was holding hostage (Michelle Horn) was going to be the last female he was going to be near for the rest of his life.  Earlier in the film her father (Kevin Pollak) tried to dissuade her from dressing like a tramp.  Being eyeballed by punks with guns certainly seems to suggest that she might reconsider her clothing choices in the future (especially in terms of any words that might appear on her shirts).Director Florent Siri comes up with some interesting camera shots and even managed to impress me with a slow motion shot (I have been wincing at those pretty much since I saw the end of ""Rocky II"").  If anything, Siri is fascinating by the cinematic style of violence he can depict and if you are looking for an action film with flair this might fit the bill.  The only one liner Willis' character has in the film is an echo of something just said by one of the bad guys and most of the key moments for his character are inarticulate looks of fear, rage, and despair.  That is why I thought the two hostage situations were motivation enough without needing to resort to the one that went wrong.  The end game of ""Hostage"" requires a couple of reverses to help things along, but I actually found it quite interesting to suddenly be rooting for a character that I was hoping to see dead and although I did figure out the finale surprise twist it was not telegraphed that far in advance, so I was more pleased with myself than disappointed in the film.",4,Bruce Willis is overly motivated to save these hostages,1110844800,"03 15, 2005",2005,4360,"['Going', 'film', 'should', 'know', 'Hostage', 'top', 'sort', 'film', 'Based', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Robert', 'Crais', '2005', 'release', 'one', 'hostage', 'drama', 'not', 'enough', 'be', 'two', 'hostage', 'dramas', 'going', 'same', 'time', 'just', 'make', 'things', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'Then', 'hero', 'should', 'be', 'burdened', 'guilt', 'previous', 'hostage', 'situation', 'wrong', 'one', 'hand', 'scenario', 'pretty', 'unbelievable', 'other', 'hand', 'get', 'point', 'where', 'are', 'wondering', 'how', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'requisite', 'happy', 'ending', 'so', 'will', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'call', 'Hostage', 'predictable', 'being', 'greatest', 'Hollywood', 'sin', 'am', 'willing', 'forgive', 'film', 'faults.The', 'prologue', 'Jeff', 'Talley', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'long', 'hair', 'long', 'beard', 'dealing', 'hostage', 'situation', 'L.A.', 'goal', 'make', 'sure', 'nobody', 'die', 'not', 'happen', 'year', 'later', 'Talley', 'chief', 'police', 'Bristo', 'Camino', 'Ventura', 'County', 'wife', 'Serena', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'daughter', 'Rumer', 'Willis', 'are', 'still', 'living', 'city', 'come', 'out', 'visit', 'weekends', 'daughter', 'not', 'speaking', 'father', 'apparently', 'worried', 'parents', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'divorced', 'unable', 'understand', 'why', 'daddy', 'relative', 'peace', 'quiet', 'sticks', 'Willis', 'most', 'famous', 'screen', 'incarnation', 'John', 'McClane', 'Die', 'Hard', 'flicks', 'rule', 'irony', 'applies', 'biggest', 'nightmare', 'up', 'town.Three', 'young', 'punks', 'are', 'sitting', 'stolen', 'pick-up', 'truck', 'ogling', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'off', 'getting', 'back', 'daddy', 'SUV', 'decide', 'follow', 'family', 'home', 'when', 'discover', 'beautiful', 'home', 'nestled', 'hills', 'town', 'decide', 'break', 'push', 'family', 'around', 'thing', 'know', 'somebody', 'dead', 'Talley', 'arrives', 'scene', 'be', 'greeted', 'hail', 'bullets', 'Smith', 'family', 'up', 'being', 'held', 'hostage', 'three', 'punks', 'when', 'County', 'Sheriff', 'up', 'Talley', 'perfectly', 'happy', 'turn', 'over', 'command', 'walk', 'away', 'However', 'interested', 'third', 'party', 'hostage', 'situation', 'who', 'Talley', 'resume', 'command', 'do', 'everything', 'power', 'not', 'make', 'sure', 'everybody', 'out', 'alive', 'certain', 'computer', 'disc', 'retrieved.Again', 'totally', 'unbelievable', 'situation', 'not', 'boring', 'buy', 'scenario', 'go', 'along', 'ride', 'do', 'not', 'only', 'question', 'red', 'herring', 'picked', 'up', 'good', 'end', 'whatsoever', 'was', 'intentional', 'uncorrupted', 'mistook', 'why', 'title', 'credits', 'look', 'dry', 'run', 'Sin', 'City', 'also', 'have', 'discernable', 'payoff', 'film', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'film', 'up', 'being', 'Mars', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'trigger', 'happy', 'one', 'punks', 'who', 'had', 'be', 'scared', 'kept', 'thinking', 'point', 'would', 'realize', 'young', 'girl', 'was', 'holding', 'hostage', 'Michelle', 'Horn', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'last', 'female', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'rest', 'life', 'Earlier', 'film', 'father', 'Kevin', 'Pollak', 'tried', 'dissuade', 'dressing', 'tramp', 'Being', 'eyeballed', 'punks', 'guns', 'certainly', 'suggest', 'might', 'reconsider', 'clothing', 'choices', 'future', 'especially', 'terms', 'words', 'might', 'appear', 'shirts', '.Director', 'Florent', 'Siri', 'up', 'interesting', 'camera', 'shots', 'even', 'managed', 'impress', 'slow', 'motion', 'shot', 'have', 'been', 'wincing', 'pretty', 'much', 'saw', 'end', 'Rocky', 'II', 'anything', 'Siri', 'fascinating', 'cinematic', 'style', 'violence', 'can', 'depict', 'are', 'looking', 'action', 'film', 'flair', 'might', 'fit', 'bill', 'only', 'one', 'liner', 'Willis', 'character', 'film', 'echo', 'something', 'just', 'said', 'one', 'bad', 'guys', 'most', 'key', 'moments', 'character', 'are', 'inarticulate', 'looks', 'fear', 'rage', 'despair', 'why', 'thought', 'two', 'hostage', 'situations', 'were', 'motivation', 'enough', 'needing', 'resort', 'one', 'went', 'wrong', 'end', 'game', 'Hostage', 'couple', 'reverses', 'help', 'things', 'actually', 'found', 'quite', 'interesting', 'suddenly', 'be', 'rooting', 'character', 'was', 'hoping', 'see', 'dead', 'did', 'figure', 'out', 'finale', 'surprise', 'twist', 'was', 'not', 'telegraphed', 'far', 'advance', 'was', 'more', 'pleased', 'disappointed', 'film']",N/A

A year later, he's the Sheriff in a small Southern California town where nothing ever happens.Unfortunately, that's about to change.

I've heard his fans are disappointed with this adaptation, and I can understand why.  It starts well, with an interesting premise that really drew me in.  However, the longer the movie went on, the more preposterous it became.  And the ending was much weaker then I wanted it to be.This movie is rated R.  I caught it on TV, so I know parts were cut out.  In fact, it was laughable when the language was removed.  I don't know if any violence hit the cutting room floor, but there was still plenty of it here.  It did get pretty dark and gruesome near the end.

He looks out of shape (deliberate?), long GREY haired, and with a grey beard, just to round things off. The clothing is awful too, all baggy, but it has to be deliberate, as by the end of the movie, he's buff, shaved, and wearing tight t-shirts. Oh, and a topless scene too. Woohoo! Is that a real tattoo?This is a very character driven movie, which I was surprised at, and definitely wasn't expecting. I was thinking that if it didn't have Bruce, it could have turned into a straight-to-DVD movie that you get from the bargain bins. Having Bruce makes it worth watching (and more), and also a script that could have been the next Die Hard script does give it potential.The story goes like this: Bruce is now a small town police guy, who works on the policy of No Crime Tuesdays (or No Crime Week if you would prefer). He's hiding from his past, and is happy living the quiet life, although his wife and daughter aren't. (Look out for Bruce's real life oldest daughter, Rumer, playing his daughter in this. She's her mother's double, but with her father's jawline. Blink, and you WILL miss her, which shows having two of the biggest parents in showbiz does not bring you instant movie roles.)Three guys are across the other side of town, thinking about stealing a car. Two brothers, one good, the other a wannabe gangster, are with the ultimate bad boy, black wearing, scene stealing, Ben Foster.A father, daughter, and son, are in witness protection, in a house straight out of Panic Room, in fact it is one big Panic Room. The dad is a small time criminal, the daughter wants to go out, (wearing more than what I wear when I go out and no one stops me!), her father wants her to change, and the son just wants some peace. The three bad boys break in, intent on stealing the car, but get interrupted by the family, and sidetracked by an open safe full of cash, and it escalates from there.There's another set of bad guys, who are linked to the father, and when they find out Bruce is involved, kidnap his family. A small storyline, but still an important one.As I've already mentioned, Ben Foster steals every scene, and is well worth watching in this. He plays a cold hearted, evil character here, with black clothes, black hair, and very cold eyes. The character is very well developed, but not overly developed. His back story is a mystery to begin with, but piece by piece, you learn a bit more about the character. I said to my dad afterwards, that his whole character, the way he carried himself, especially the final scene, reminded me of The Crow, and particularly the late Brandon Lee. His final scene is something that will stick in my head for a good long time (I'm surprised I didn't have nightmares, without giving too much away). All his evil and emotion are portrayed vividly through his eyes, and he has the potential to be a really, really good actor.The whole hostage situation, and the negotiation tactics are what keeps this film going. Normally some finales leave some loose ends, but this film ties them up magnificentally, although the unidentified masked men (the second group of bad guys) does seem a little too convenient, with their motives going unexplained.I did enjoy this movie, and I can't wait to see more of Ben Foster, and it's well worth picking up for cheap. But I will warn you, you won't be able to forget Ben Foster's final scene.",3,Bruce Willis - old & grizzly?,1172016000,"02 21, 2007",2007,3444,"['start', 'will', 'shock', 'potential', 'lovers', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Me', 'shape', 'deliberate', 'long', 'GREY', 'haired', 'grey', 'beard', 'just', 'round', 'things', 'off', 'clothing', 'awful', 'too', 'baggy', 'be', 'deliberate', 'end', 'movie', 'buff', 'shaved', 'wearing', 'tight', 't-shirts', 'Oh', 'topless', 'scene', 'too', 'Woohoo', 'real', 'tattoo', 'very', 'character', 'driven', 'movie', 'was', 'surprised', 'definitely', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'was', 'thinking', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'Bruce', 'could', 'have', 'turned', 'straight-to-DVD', 'movie', 'get', 'bargain', 'bins', 'Having', 'Bruce', 'worth', 'watching', 'more', 'also', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'next', 'Die', 'Hard', 'script', 'give', 'potential.The', 'story', 'Bruce', 'now', 'small', 'town', 'police', 'guy', 'who', 'policy', 'No', 'Crime', 'Tuesdays', 'Crime', 'Week', 'would', 'prefer', 'hiding', 'past', 'happy', 'living', 'quiet', 'life', 'wife', 'daughter', 'are', ""n't"", 'Look', 'out', 'Bruce', 'real', 'life', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'Rumer', 'playing', 'daughter', 'mother', 'double', 'father', 'jawline', 'Blink', 'WILL', 'miss', 'having', 'two', 'biggest', 'parents', 'showbiz', 'not', 'bring', 'instant', 'movie', 'roles', 'Three', 'guys', 'are', 'other', 'side', 'town', 'thinking', 'stealing', 'car', 'Two', 'brothers', 'one', 'good', 'other', 'wannabe', 'gangster', 'are', 'ultimate', 'bad', 'boy', 'black', 'wearing', 'scene', 'stealing', 'Ben', 'Foster.A', 'father', 'daughter', 'son', 'are', 'witness', 'protection', 'house', 'straight', 'Panic', 'Room', 'fact', 'one', 'big', 'Panic', 'Room', 'dad', 'small', 'time', 'criminal', 'daughter', 'go', 'out', 'wearing', 'more', 'what', 'wear', 'when', 'go', 'out', 'one', 'father', 'change', 'son', 'just', 'peace', 'three', 'bad', 'boys', 'break', 'intent', 'stealing', 'car', 'get', 'interrupted', 'family', 'sidetracked', 'open', 'safe', 'full', 'cash', 'set', 'bad', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'linked', 'father', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'Bruce', 'involved', 'kidnap', 'family', 'small', 'storyline', 'still', 'important', 'one.As', ""'ve"", 'already', 'mentioned', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'steals', 'scene', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'cold', 'hearted', 'evil', 'character', 'here', 'black', 'clothes', 'black', 'hair', 'very', 'cold', 'eyes', 'character', 'very', 'well', 'developed', 'not', 'overly', 'developed', 'back', 'story', 'mystery', 'begin', 'piece', 'piece', 'learn', 'bit', 'more', 'character', 'said', 'dad', 'afterwards', 'whole', 'character', 'way', 'carried', 'especially', 'final', 'scene', 'reminded', 'Crow', 'particularly', 'late', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'final', 'scene', 'something', 'will', 'stick', 'head', 'good', 'long', 'time', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'nightmares', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'evil', 'emotion', 'are', 'portrayed', 'vividly', 'eyes', 'potential', 'be', 'really', 'really', 'good', 'actor.The', 'whole', 'hostage', 'situation', 'negotiation', 'tactics', 'are', 'what', 'film', 'going', 'Normally', 'finales', 'leave', 'loose', 'ends', 'film', 'up', 'magnificentally', 'unidentified', 'masked', 'men', 'second', 'group', 'bad', 'guys', 'seem', 'little', 'too', 'convenient', 'motives', 'going', 'unexplained.I', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'more', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'well', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'cheap', 'will', 'warn', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'forget', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'final', 'scene']",N/A

Kevin Pollack, who I remember best as the American President caught in a blizzard in DETERRENCE (i.e. if you check that one out, look for a small role played by Sean Astin among some other notable names).  Another small role is played by the actress who played Mrs. Landingham, the President's first secretary, from the WEST WING.  Her name is Kathryn Joosten.Lots of twist and turns with tense moments. Subplot story going on between Willis and his wife who are nearing divorce.  Looks for the criss cross of three car moments and the villain and Willis saying the same thing.  Strange connections.

""Hostage"" takes an age-old, stale concept...the hostage thriller...and tweaks it enough to make the most jaded viewer sit up and take notice 45 minutes into the film.First of all, the director, Florent Siri, flaunts his creative vision at every turn, telling the story simply, yet inserting sly edits or artful compositions that you only notice when you get a chance to breathe.The performances were all fine (except Willis' estranged wife...she struck me as a little amateurish) with Ben Foster doing a particularly menacing turn. In fact, it bordered on the ""disturbing""...seeing evil right there on the surface. He did it well. Really well.The screenplay has enough ""randomness"" to keep your attention, and honestly it has no more plot contrivances than any other movie of this genre. The good thing is that you are too involved to care, which shows you the movie is doing it's job.Even the opening credits were kinda neat.One little caveat, which will make sense to those who have seen the film. Maybe I missed it, but the identity of an important bad guy is never revealed. It feels like it that should be important, and there are lines that suggest that we are leading up to a big ""a-HA!"" moment.

It can be easy to see that when watching the ultra glossy, over the top action that is found throughout Hostage, which finds Bruce Willis as a burned out hostage negotiator whose family has been taken hostage, and whose lives depend on that of another family taken hostage as well by a trio of young, would be thieves (Ben Foster, Jonathan Tucker, and Marshall Allman).  However, things don't go as well as one would hope, and soon enough good 'ol Bruce has to take matters into his own hands.  Willis is pretty good in a role that fits him like a glove, while the glossy action sequences end up being surprisingly tense and bloody to boot.  However, Hostage ends up being way more over the top than it should be thanks to the schizoid screenplay, and the performances from Tucker, Marshall, and Foster in particular who apparently would have been better off in the looney bin.

I saw this in the theater just yesterday, and I was completely blown away by the action, suspense, and the surprising twists and turns from pulse-pounding start to breathtaking finish! The direction of Florent Siri was flawless! Willis' intense performance could not be better! In fact, this is his best since ""Die Hard"" and ""The Sixth Sense""! Joining him are Kevin Pollak (Willis' ""The Whole Nine Yards"" and ""The Whole Ten Yards"" co-star), Ben Foster (""Liberty Heights""), Jonathan Tucker (""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre""), and young newcomers Jimmy Bennett, Michelle Horn, and Marshall Allman, in which they all gave excellent supporting performances!The film focuses on LAPD negotiator Jeff Talley (Willis), who became devastated by a failed hostage situation which resulted in the deaths of a young mother and her child. Talley exits Los Angeles for a no-profile job as chief of police in the low-crime hamlet of Bristo Camino, a small town in Ventura County. When three delinquent teenagers named Mars (Foster), Dennis (Tucker), and Kevin (Marshall Allman) follow home a family intending to steal their car, they have inadvertently picked the wrong house on the wrong day. The trio find themselves trapped in a multi-million dollar compound on the outskirts of town, owned by Walter Smith (Pollak), an accountant working for a mysterious crime enterprise. Panicked, the teenagers take the family hostage, placing Talley in exactly the kind of situation he never wanted to face again. Soon after, Talley readily hands authority of the hostage situation to the Ventura County Sheriff's Department and leaves the scene. Meanwhile, inside the compound is digital information, which is time-sensitive and invaluable to the mysterious criminals and critical to their enterprise. They will stop at nothing to get what belongs to them. The collateral: Talley's wife and daughter mysteriously taken hostage as well! This really puts Talley in a predicament: How does he save his wife and daughter without losing the lives of the hostages inside the house? Talley is forced to resume the command he abandoned, where the stakes quickly evolve into a hostage situation more volatile and terrifying than anything he could ever imagine.The ensemble cast is amazing! Bruce Willis, without a doubt, brings an electrifying presence into the role of Jeff Talley. Possibly his best role since the John McClane ""Die Hard"" days! Kevin Pollak was a little bit underused, but was still great nevertheless. Ben Foster brings a sinister, morbid change-of-pace performance to the role of Mars. A very well-done performance by the rising young star. Jonathan Tucker and Marshall Allman, who play brothers Dennis and Kevin Kelly, give powerful, extraordinary performances throughout. 17-year-old Michelle Horn really lives up to her name as Smith's daughter, Jennifer, and young newcomer Jimmy Bennett, who plays Smith's son, Tommy, was simply amazing! In fact, there seems to be a powerful and unforgettable connection between young Jimmy's character and Willis' character (reminded me of Willis and Haley Joel Osment in 1999's ""The Sixth Sense"").In conclusion, ""Hostage"", without a doubt, really makes up for the other Willis disappointments that were ""Tears of the Sun"" and ""The Whole Ten Yards"".

It's decently-paced, well-acted, and fun.Jeff Talley (Bruce Willis) was the chief hostage negotiator for the LAPD before a hostage situation went horribly wrong under his command. He got out of the big-city life and took a job as the chief of police in a quiet town far away from the hustle and bustle. When a trio of ne'er-do-wells attempt to stael an SUV and end up barricaded inside the owner's house, Talley immediately calls in his old colleagues. The problem is, the family's father is involved in some shady dealings, and his pals tell Talley in no uncertain terms that he needs to take over and get their aims met before anything else happens.There's no big plot twists, no big subtexts, just straightforward action-adventure. All well and good, or would be if Siri hadn't decided to get a little arty on us at the end; we're left with one huge question (the defense of which would be, I'm sure, ""the answer doesn't matter"") that keeps nagging after the last reel has long been played.

With just a minor clipping of subthreads that lead nowhere, or a somewhat less cacophonic background score, it might even have made for a 4-star action thriller.The plot is awash with twists and tension, but the music hoses us with sounds that swell at all the wrong moments, least necessary of which are those when our supercop steps out of vehicles in slow motion. Such gratuitous effects reek of B-grade.The script falls squarely in not-bad territory. Our adolescent and thus inadvertent hostage takers do well with what they are given, but one of them has to personify half-baked psychopathic undertones while the other two wade in sporadic brotherhood. Characters such as the female superintendent of police, or a baritoned and masked bad guy, come across as little more than stereotypical caricatures. Plus, I would really have liked to feel for Bruce Willis' family.To fan the fire, literally, the last half hour swoons with convenient developments that defy logic at many levels.But all that is probably par for the course with lollipop thrillers so it shouldn't hurt.

The director keeps the intensity strong throughout most of the movie and you keep hoping and wondering how it's possible for the hero to save everyone.The movie has an interesting premise in that Jeff Tally (Bruce Willis) has to save both his family and the family that's been taken hostage.  It's a balance beam that he is stuck on and one that establishes a very nice pacing and intensity.  Complications, of course, creep in to make Tally's job even more difficult.And of course there is the house the rich family live in.  It is a modern day castle complete with a huge gate, jail-like shutters that slam down, indoor water falls, etc.  The house (while a laughable plot device) is pretty cool and makes the movie fun.  Seeing one of the kids of the hostage family manuever through the crawl spaces (bringing back fond memories of Aliens) is a cool addition and gives the kids something more to do than be a victim.Hostage is a very violent film and definitely earns its R rating.  Keep that in mind if you want to bring your kids or someone under age.  It's not the stylized violence of, say, Matrix.  It's more in your face.I'm not sure exactly what to say about this movie.  It's not a movie I plan on seeing again, nor will I buy it when it comes out.  But it was fun.  Pretty predictable, not too believable in the long run but fun.  It's not the best action movie by far but considering there's not too many of them out right now (nor is there many good movies out), this is a good bet for your $8.

That was circa 1988, when Willis was perhaps Hollywood's most dynamic action hero; however, with Florent Emilio Siri's 2005 release entitled ""Hostage"", viewers are able to see that Bruce almighty may be out of his league.Willis stars as former Los Angeles hostage negotiator Jeff Talley, who has now moved to become the police chief of the small, quiet town of Bristo Camino Failing to save his last victims, Talley is haunted by his letdown as a negotiator and swears to never get wrapped up in that kind of police work again.  Talley's fears are put to the test when a group of rugged bandits (headed by Jonathan Tucker as Dennis Kelly in a fine performance) take a wealthy family hostage inside of their luxurious home.  What the criminals do not know is that the father, Walter Smith (Kevin Pollack), is a mischievous accountant who has illegitimate information to report to a big-time kingpin.  In order to ensure that he receives his numbers, the kingpin takes Talley's family hostage until the police chief conjures up a way to acquire the important data files from the Smith home.  As Talley attempts to talk his way into saving his own family, he must figure out how to wheel-and-deal with Dennis, his brother (Marshall Allman), and a sociopath named Mars (Ben Foster) and direct the Smith children (Jimmy Bennett and Michelle Horn) to safety.""Hostage"" is an admirable attempt as an exciting, emotional action film.  Willis thrives in this ""every man"" kind of role; however, director Florent Emilio Siri puts little focus on the Talley family and allots too much screen time to Willis's ""woe is me"" routine.  Willis is only fair as the inner-anguished negotiator-turned-chief and Pollack's role is a waste.  The real winners of the film are the younger actors and actresses, providing some solid support to the aging star.  ""Hostage"" is stimulating and moderately suspenseful (and moderately predictable), but Willis is not hanging from rafters, shooting the bad guys while running barefoot over glass, or jumping off moving airplanes.  If you're looking for the Willis of old, ""Hostage"" may be a disappointment; but the film does manage to paint a fairly believable portrait of the horrors that circle around a hostage-and those who are directly involved in suppressing them.",3,Hostage  (2005),1120089600,"06 30, 2005",2005,2741,"['Director', 'Florent', 'Emilio', 'SiriCast', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Kevin', 'Pollack', 'Jimmy', 'Bennett', 'Michelle', 'Horn', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'Jonathan', 'Tucker', 'Marshall', 'Allman', 'Serena', 'Scott', 'Thomas.Rated', 'R', 'strong', 'violence', 'language', 'brief', 'scene', 'drug', 'use.Running', 'Time', '109', 'minutes.Bruce', 'Willis', 'dazzled', 'movie-goers', 'world-wide', 'Die', 'Hard', 'incredibly', 'likable', 'pizzazz', 'charm', 'parading', 'around', 'renegade', 'copper', 'enough', 'wits', 'muscle', 'Road', 'House', 'sequel', 'was', 'circa', '1988', 'when', 'Willis', 'was', 'perhaps', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'dynamic', 'action', 'hero', 'however', 'Florent', 'Emilio', 'Siri', '2005', 'release', 'entitled', 'Hostage', 'viewers', 'are', 'able', 'see', 'Bruce', 'almighty', 'may', 'be', 'league.Willis', 'stars', 'former', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'hostage', 'negotiator', 'Jeff', 'Talley', 'who', 'now', 'moved', 'become', 'police', 'chief', 'small', 'quiet', 'town', 'Bristo', 'Camino', 'Failing', 'save', 'last', 'victims', 'Talley', 'haunted', 'letdown', 'negotiator', 'swears', 'never', 'get', 'wrapped', 'up', 'kind', 'police', 'work', 'again', 'Talley', 'fears', 'are', 'put', 'test', 'when', 'group', 'rugged', 'bandits', 'headed', 'Jonathan', 'Tucker', 'Dennis', 'Kelly', 'fine', 'performance', 'take', 'wealthy', 'family', 'hostage', 'luxurious', 'home', 'What', 'criminals', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'father', 'Walter', 'Smith', 'Kevin', 'Pollack', 'mischievous', 'accountant', 'who', 'illegitimate', 'information', 'report', 'big-time', 'kingpin', 'order', 'ensure', 'numbers', 'kingpin', 'Talley', 'family', 'hostage', 'police', 'chief', 'up', 'way', 'acquire', 'important', 'data', 'files', 'Smith', 'home', 'Talley', 'attempts', 'talk', 'way', 'saving', 'own', 'family', 'must', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'wheel-and-deal', 'Dennis', 'brother', 'Marshall', 'Allman', 'sociopath', 'named', 'Mars', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'direct', 'Smith', 'children', 'Jimmy', 'Bennett', 'Michelle', 'Horn', 'safety', 'Hostage', 'admirable', 'attempt', 'exciting', 'emotional', 'action', 'film', 'Willis', 'man', 'kind', 'role', 'however', 'director', 'Florent', 'Emilio', 'Siri', 'little', 'focus', 'Talley', 'family', 'allots', 'too', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'Willis', 'woe', 'routine', 'Willis', 'only', 'fair', 'inner-anguished', 'negotiator-turned-chief', 'Pollack', 'role', 'waste', 'real', 'winners', 'film', 'are', 'younger', 'actors', 'actresses', 'providing', 'solid', 'support', 'aging', 'star', 'Hostage', 'stimulating', 'moderately', 'suspenseful', 'moderately', 'predictable', 'Willis', 'not', 'hanging', 'rafters', 'shooting', 'bad', 'guys', 'running', 'barefoot', 'glass', 'jumping', 'off', 'moving', 'airplanes', ""'re"", 'looking', 'Willis', 'old', 'Hostage', 'may', 'be', 'disappointment', 'film', 'manage', 'paint', 'fairly', 'believable', 'portrait', 'horrors', 'circle', 'hostage-and', 'who', 'are', 'directly', 'involved', 'suppressing']",N/A

As the film opens Talley refuses to set the sharpshooter take out a man who is holding his own family hostage.  Talley tries to talk him out but the man kills his wife and young son and then kills himself.  So immediately the viewer is manipulated into felling sorry for Talley.  A year later, the stress has evidently got to him and he has moved his own family to the small California town oif Bristo Camino, to become the town Sheriff.Trying to escape the big city problems, Talley soon finds heimself caught up in a a dual hostage situation, including his own wife and daughter.  When three local hoods follow a SUV back to a lavish home in the hills, the trio break into the home to steal the car.  The home is owned Walter Smith (Kevin Pollack) who seems to be a bit of a shady business man.  Smith is home with his teenage daughter Jennifer, and young son Tommy.Now Smith has the most elaborate security system complete with alarms, surveillance cameras, front gate...the whole nine yards and yet the three hoods, brothers Dennis and Kevin Kelly and their sinister partner Mars, just hop the fence and get into the house.  I had a little problem with their so easily bypassying the security systems.  little Tommy manages to trip a silent alarm and soon a local female cop resonds to the alarm and is shot by Mars.  This of course brings out all the local cops and nearby county sheriffs to help.Now comes the sub-plot.  Seems Smith has a DVD that some very nasty men want to get their hands on.  They kidnap Talley's wife and daughter and order him to take charge of the situation and get them the DVD or his family will be killed.  Talley now has to contend with not only these organized pros, but the jumpy young hoodlums in the house.Willis is his usual enjoyable self.  He doesn't play quite the super-heroic type he did in the Die Hard films.  The best performance, hands down goes to Ben Foster who played the menacing, violent, and self-destructive Mars, who had an almost child-like fascination with death.  Jimmy Bennett as Tommy is yet another young kid who seems to have a touch of kevin McCallister in him as he continually manages to outsmart the bad guys by using a series of air ducts and secret ceiling doors to move about the house and even make phone calls out to the police.

There's a major problem when the one involved in the most suspenseful action scenes is a kid, and not Mr. Bruce Willis.Willis is Jeff Talley, a former hostage negotiator, turned chief of police in a small California town.  He finds himself in a familiar situation when a home invasion and attempted robbery is botched, and becomes a homicide and hostage situation.  The involvement of an outside element, leads to Talley's wife and daughter being kidnapped as well, creating a second set of hostages.Things unravel when the home invaders turn on each other. As the high-tech mansion burns, Talley rescues the hostages, setting the stage for a slow-motion shootout with the remaining baddies, and a tearful family reunion.  Another unrealistic comic book finish.`Hostage' is flashy, but the lack of a credible plot and manipulative style may disappoint those that expect more.

904395,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0009ETCUQ,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 6]","As the title suggests, 'Hostage' has two things -- hostage situation and Bruce Willis.  For most of film fans, that conbination means 'Die Hard' but as it turned out, his new film is not as good as that classic actioner.  Still, for all its too implausible story, 'Hostage' is full of (often violent) actions and suspence, hugely supported by a large amount of bullets flying over Willis's head.The film opens with a familiar pattern -- a failed police negotiator Bruce Willis moves into a small town with his family, where he becomes a cop.  Now, three young thieves sneak into a rich family's house to steal a car, but their plans go awfully bad when they are instead trapped in the house fortified with surveillance cameras, where they find many 'Benjamins' concealed in a safe.Things don't stop there, for another family (and that is Bruce Willis's character's for that matter) is also kidnapped, and he has to deal alone with the TWO cases at the same time, without letting the authority know the truths.  This superhuman task needs a help which comes from the inside of the house (of the first case), in the shape of a wise little boy, who escaped from the crinimals, and maintains the contact from the outside by a cellphone.Familiar?  Sure, it is familiar -- hostages, radio contact, etc. -- but all the elements that were seen in 'Die Hard' are used in a different way, to give more pumped-up effects.  The script of Doug Richardson ('Die Hard 2') provides enough actions to grab our attention, directed by French director Florent Emilio Siri, who clearly has good skills of composing reasonably exciting action sequences with good pace and editing.But the fact still remains that the story is too far-fetched, and at least they should have re-considered the casting of Rumer Willis (Bruce's real-life daughter) as, you know, kidnapped daughter of Willis's cop.  Quite frankly, she is doing the same thing as Sofia Coppola did to her father's 'Godfather III.'  The key roles should be given to actors strictly according to the acting ability.In spite of its unbelievable story and the obvious lack of good supports (Kevin Pollack remains unconscious through the considerable part of the film), 'Hostage' is still a reasonable action film made with taut, slick direction from Siri (whose 'The Nest' made in his native country is a real surprise), but it does not change the course of the fading star status of recent Bruce Willis.",3,"Sounds Like 'Die Hard 3.5': Implausible, But Fairly Entertaining",1120003200,"06 29, 2005",2005,2438,"['title', ""'Hostage"", 'two', 'things', 'hostage', 'situation', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'most', 'film', 'fans', 'conbination', 'Hard', 'turned', 'out', 'new', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'classic', 'actioner', 'Still', 'too', 'implausible', 'story', ""'Hostage"", 'full', 'often', 'violent', 'actions', 'suspence', 'hugely', 'supported', 'large', 'amount', 'bullets', 'flying', 'Willis', 'head.The', 'film', 'familiar', 'pattern', 'failed', 'police', 'negotiator', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'small', 'town', 'family', 'where', 'cop', 'Now', 'three', 'young', 'thieves', 'sneak', 'rich', 'family', 'house', 'steal', 'car', 'plans', 'go', 'awfully', 'bad', 'when', 'are', 'instead', 'trapped', 'house', 'fortified', 'surveillance', 'cameras', 'where', 'find', 'many', ""'Benjamins"", 'concealed', 'safe.Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'there', 'family', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'character', 'matter', 'also', 'kidnapped', 'deal', 'alone', 'TWO', 'cases', 'same', 'time', 'letting', 'authority', 'know', 'truths', 'superhuman', 'task', 'help', 'inside', 'house', 'first', 'case', 'shape', 'wise', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'escaped', 'crinimals', 'contact', 'outside', 'cellphone.Familiar', 'Sure', 'familiar', 'hostages', 'radio', 'contact', 'etc', 'elements', 'were', 'seen', ""'Die"", 'Hard', 'are', 'used', 'different', 'way', 'give', 'more', 'pumped-up', 'effects', 'script', 'Doug', 'Richardson', 'Hard', '2', 'enough', 'actions', 'grab', 'attention', 'directed', 'French', 'director', 'Florent', 'Emilio', 'Siri', 'who', 'clearly', 'good', 'skills', 'composing', 'reasonably', 'exciting', 'action', 'sequences', 'good', 'pace', 'editing.But', 'fact', 'still', 'story', 'too', 'far-fetched', 'least', 'should', 'have', 're-considered', 'casting', 'Rumer', 'Willis', 'Bruce', 'real-life', 'daughter', 'know', 'kidnapped', 'daughter', 'Willis', 'cop', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'doing', 'same', 'thing', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'did', 'father', ""'Godfather"", 'III', 'key', 'roles', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'actors', 'strictly', 'according', 'acting', 'ability.In', 'spite', 'unbelievable', 'story', 'obvious', 'lack', 'good', 'supports', 'Kevin', 'Pollack', 'unconscious', 'considerable', 'part', 'film', 'still', 'reasonable', 'action', 'film', 'made', 'taut', 'slick', 'direction', 'Siri', 'Nest', 'made', 'native', 'country', 'real', 'surprise', 'not', 'change', 'course', 'fading', 'star', 'status', 'recent', 'Bruce', 'Willis']",N/A

Burned out hostage negotiator Jeff Talley (Bruce Willis) takes a job as the sheriff in a small town to escape the high pressure world of crime enforcement that destroyed his life. What he walks into is exactly what he left behind but on a more personal scale. When a trio of teen thugs stop in his town to eat and are given the finger by a young girl, they find out where she lives and break into her home taking the entire family hostage. Suddenly Talley must deal with the entire situation he walked away from but on a smaller more personal scale. What Talley walks into turns out to much larger than just a hostage situationA fun high octane thriller that captures Willis in top form, the ""Hostage"" could play like a variation on the ""Die Hard"" formula (which isn't a surprise given that writer Richardson penned ""Die Hard 2"").  The direction is sharp and although showy recalls John McTiernan's (""Die Hard"", ""Predator"") best work. Kevin Pollack gives a nice performance as the beleaguered dad and Willis gives a nicely etched low key performance as Talley that does much more than play as a variation on his character from ""Die Hard"". Although it didn't pick up much of an audience when it was first released, ""Hostage"" has enough chills and thrills to keep the audience happy.A very sharp nicely done transfer from Buena Vista, ""Hostage"" looks particularly good with sharp images, bright colors with a nice golden hue to many of the scenes. There are some minor edge enhancements but, on the whole, ""Hostage"" looks extremely good here. Both the 2.0 and 5.1This edition comes with minimal extras but they're nicely done. We get deleted and extended scenes with optional commentary from director Siri. There's also a typical ""Behind-the-Scenes"" featurette. It's not bad it's just done by the numbers. Some of the comments by the actors are pretty intelligent and articulate but much more could have been done than scenes intercut of talking heads and scenes from the film to illustrate points. WE HAVE SEEN the film. What we need to see is something we haven't before.  This could be done by focusing on real life hostage negotiator or, perhaps, comments from the technical advisors about what they've faced in the real world. Anything that might have occurred in the film that they think might happen in real life.A fine underrated thriller, ""Hostage"" was ignored when it was released and that's too bad; Willis gives a nice performance with a touch more humanity than we've seen before and a touch more vulnerability as well. The featurette is largely perfunctory and the commentary, while it has some nice moments, would have benefited from a tag team approach to make it more interesting.",3,Solid thriller based on Robert Crais' novel,1119571200,"06 24, 2005",2005,2781,"['Hostage', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'booming', 'music', 'opening', 'titles', 'Burned', 'out', 'hostage', 'negotiator', 'Jeff', 'Talley', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'job', 'sheriff', 'small', 'town', 'escape', 'high', 'pressure', 'world', 'crime', 'enforcement', 'destroyed', 'life', 'What', 'exactly', 'what', 'left', 'behind', 'more', 'personal', 'scale', 'When', 'trio', 'teen', 'thugs', 'stop', 'town', 'eat', 'are', 'given', 'finger', 'young', 'girl', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'break', 'home', 'taking', 'entire', 'family', 'hostage', 'Suddenly', 'Talley', 'must', 'deal', 'entire', 'situation', 'walked', 'away', 'smaller', 'more', 'personal', 'scale', 'What', 'Talley', 'walks', 'turns', 'out', 'much', 'larger', 'just', 'hostage', 'situationA', 'fun', 'high', 'octane', 'thriller', 'Willis', 'top', 'form', 'Hostage', 'could', 'play', 'variation', 'Die', 'Hard', 'formula', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'given', 'writer', 'Richardson', 'penned', 'Die', 'Hard', '2', 'direction', 'sharp', 'showy', 'John', 'McTiernan', 'Die', 'Hard', 'Predator', 'best', 'work', 'Kevin', 'Pollack', 'nice', 'performance', 'beleaguered', 'dad', 'Willis', 'nicely', 'etched', 'low', 'key', 'performance', 'Talley', 'much', 'more', 'play', 'variation', 'character', 'Die', 'Hard', 'did', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'much', 'audience', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'Hostage', 'enough', 'chills', 'thrills', 'keep', 'audience', 'happy.A', 'very', 'sharp', 'nicely', 'done', 'transfer', 'Buena', 'Vista', 'Hostage', 'particularly', 'good', 'sharp', 'images', 'bright', 'colors', 'nice', 'golden', 'hue', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'minor', 'edge', 'enhancements', 'whole', 'Hostage', 'extremely', 'good', 'here', '2.0', '5.1This', 'edition', 'minimal', 'extras', ""'re"", 'nicely', 'done', 'get', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'optional', 'commentary', 'director', 'Siri', 'also', 'typical', 'Behind-the-Scenes', 'featurette', 'not', 'bad', 'just', 'done', 'numbers', 'comments', 'actors', 'are', 'pretty', 'intelligent', 'articulate', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'scenes', 'intercut', 'talking', 'heads', 'scenes', 'film', 'illustrate', 'points', 'WE', 'HAVE', 'SEEN', 'film', 'What', 'need', 'see', 'something', 'have', ""n't"", 'before', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'focusing', 'real', 'life', 'hostage', 'negotiator', 'perhaps', 'comments', 'technical', 'advisors', 'what', ""'ve"", 'faced', 'real', 'world', 'Anything', 'might', 'have', 'occurred', 'film', 'think', 'might', 'happen', 'real', 'life.A', 'fine', 'underrated', 'thriller', 'Hostage', 'was', 'ignored', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'too', 'bad', 'Willis', 'nice', 'performance', 'touch', 'more', 'humanity', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'touch', 'more', 'vulnerability', 'as', 'well', 'featurette', 'largely', 'perfunctory', 'commentary', 'nice', 'moments', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', 'tag', 'team', 'approach', 'make', 'more', 'interesting']",N/A
