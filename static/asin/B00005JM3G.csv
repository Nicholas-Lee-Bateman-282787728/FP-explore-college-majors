Erhmm... well the do's and don'ts list of drawing the Hills was interesting and makes you realize how much detail really goes into animation.The only reason why I give 4 stars,is because it would have been nice to have 2 or 3 full seasons...I would have even paid alot more to have more KOTH.13 episodes just doesn't seem like all that much esp. after watching the Family Guy dvd set.Still though this is a great set,and I look forward to buying future installments.",4,Excellent!,1060041600,"08 5, 2003",2003,974,"['agree', 'majority', 'reviews', 'here', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'praise', 'short', 'sweet.I', 'think', 'KOTH', 'great', 'show', 'so', 'bought', 'dvd', 'collection', 'as', 'soon', 'laid', 'eyes', 'it.Any', 'fan', 'KOTH', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'matter', 'will', 'love', 'set.There', 'are', 'also', 'alot', 'more', 'extras', 'dvd', 'set', 'Futurama', 'set.For', 'instance', 'intros', 'dvds', 'Hank', 'Bobby', 'Dale.Interviews', 'commentaries', 'diffrent', 'voice', 'actors', 'was', 'also', 'great.Man', 'lady', 'voice', 'Luanne', 'hottie', 'Erhmm', 'well', 'do', ""don'ts"", 'list', 'drawing', 'Hills', 'was', 'interesting', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'detail', 'really', 'animation.The', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', '2', '3', 'full', 'seasons', 'would', 'have', 'even', 'paid', 'alot', 'more', 'have', 'more', 'KOTH.13', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'much', 'esp', 'watching', 'Family', 'Guy', 'dvd', 'set.Still', 'great', 'set', 'look', 'forward', 'buying', 'future', 'installments']",King of the Hill - The Complete First Season

612450,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00005JM3G,B. E Jackson,"[3, 3]","King of the Hill is one of the greatest animated adults cartoons for a number of reasonsOne, the show's been around for YEARS now, and guess what?  The quality of the writing hasn't lost a step the entire time.  How many shows can we say THAT about?  Even South Park and the Simpsons, as much as I love those shows, hasn't been able to keep up the same kind of enjoyable consistency over the years.Two, the storylines are so simple, and yet, THAT'S exactly what makes the show so appealing.  Just a Texas family that well, lives like Texans.  Nothing fancy, and there's a lot of realistic and accurate things in the show that gives King of the Hill a very family-oriented feel.  So in a way, it's also a childrens show (except they mention sexual content sometimes).Third, over 200 episodes!  It's great when a good show gets to experience their full potential.  Over 200 episodes (and counting) should please anyone who likes the quality of the writing.The only problem with Season One is the same problem ALL animated shows have- the animation doesn't look as polished as it would soon appear just a couple years later.  The writing is highly memorable anyway though, and that's the most important thing to remember.",5,king of the sitcoms,1212105600,"05 30, 2008",2008,1218,"['King', 'Hill', 'one', 'greatest', 'animated', 'adults', 'cartoons', 'number', 'reasonsOne', 'show', 'been', 'YEARS', 'now', 'guess', 'what', 'quality', 'writing', ""n't"", 'lost', 'step', 'entire', 'time', 'How', 'many', 'shows', 'can', 'say', 'about', 'Even', 'South', 'Park', 'Simpsons', 'as', 'much', 'love', 'shows', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'keep', 'up', 'same', 'kind', 'enjoyable', 'consistency', 'years.Two', 'storylines', 'are', 'so', 'simple', 'yet', 'THAT', 'exactly', 'what', 'show', 'so', 'appealing', 'Just', 'Texas', 'family', 'well', 'lives', 'Texans', 'Nothing', 'fancy', 'lot', 'realistic', 'accurate', 'things', 'show', 'King', 'Hill', 'very', 'family-oriented', 'feel', 'So', 'way', 'also', 'childrens', 'show', 'mention', 'sexual', 'content', 'sometimes', '.Third', '200', 'episodes', 'great', 'when', 'good', 'show', 'experience', 'full', 'potential', '200', 'episodes', 'counting', 'should', 'please', 'anyone', 'who', 'quality', 'writing.The', 'only', 'problem', 'Season', 'One', 'same', 'problem', 'ALL', 'animated', 'shows', 'have-', 'animation', ""n't"", 'look', 'as', 'polished', 'would', 'soon', 'appear', 'just', 'couple', 'years', 'later', 'writing', 'highly', 'memorable', 'anyway', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'remember']",King of the Hill - The Complete First Season
612451,A3KMTOFTUUNFHG,B00005JM3G,Brett D. Cullum,"[0, 2]","The first season of KING OF THE HILL introduced us to an endearing Texas family helmed by the always well-meaning if narrow Hank Hill.  He's a good ole boy who wishes the world would stop to smell the propane every now and then.  Too bad he's constantly undermined by his sassy big-footed Spanish-mangling wife, shinless and cranky veteran father, his wig head kissing son, and LuAnne who has come to live with the brood from a broken home until she gets her beauty license or finds a decent boyfriend.Living in Texas I felt like I knew these people as neighbors.  The ingenuity of this series stems from being an animated reality show where nothing happens too fast.  THE SIMPSONS may be yellow satirists living in fast-moving fictional Springfield (what STATE?), but here are their flesh-colored ironic slow-paced counterparts who seem to be living in the all too real Arlen...TEXAS!  Comparing the two seems unfair.  Apart from the obvious animation and on FOX there is not much the two have in common.  The tones are completely different.  And despite tackling sex education, child abuse, adultery, and many other touchy subjects ... everything is handled in a very family friendly way.  The characters are so pure-hearted and always mean well!The DVD set is a 3 disc affair with great presentation and extras.  You get a half hour documentary on the origins (which shows each voice cast member much to your surprise!).  Then there are commentaries with creators, producers, and SURPRISE - the characters themselves.  You couldn't ask for a slicker package!  This is one to own.Yep .... yep ..... yep ....

612453,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B00005JM3G,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[2, 3]","Initially aired following the 1997 Super Bowl, King of the Hill discovered an instant audience niche that has the followed the show loyally ever since. The brainchild of Beavis and Butthead creator Mike Judge (also known for the hit movie Office Space), King of the Hill is a unique animated series in that it doesn't rely on ""cartoon"" suspension of reality or outlandish antics. In fact, the show would arguably be just as successful if it were not animated at all. Nevertheless, it's Mike Judge (voice of Hank Hill) and his unique brand of humor that make King of the Hill a must-see TV series...Set in the fictional town of Arlen, Texas, King of the Hill follows the life and exploits of Hank Hill and his traditional nuclear family. Hank is a red-state propane salesman who loves beer and apple pie, but he's constantly inundated with modern liberalism and grapples with the demands of political correctness. Hank is joined by his wife Peggy (a substitute teacher), his son Bobby (an awkward pre-pubescent youth), and a trailer park-like live-in niece named Luanne... Providing added comic relief to the series are Hank's off-the-wall friends Bill, Boomhauer (who is inaudible), and Dale (who believes everything is a government conspiracy)... Hank's Laotian neighbor Kahn (whose daughter Bobby is quite fond of) and his family live next door, providing Hank with a continuing dose of culture shock...The King Of The Hill (Season 1) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere in which we meet for the first time the various characters involved in Hank Hill's life in Arlen, Texas. Bobby gets hit in the eye with a baseball, prompting a social worker to launch an investigation into filing possible child abuse charges against Hank. Meanwhile, Hank's niece Luanne, an aspiring beautician, is forced to move in with Hank and his family after her mother is put in jail for stabbing her father... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""Square Peg"" in which Peggy is forced to teach sexual education class, and ""Hank's Unmentionable Problem"" in which Hank becomes constipated and (much to his chagrin) receives numerous opinions on how to cure it...Below is a list of episodes included on the King Of The Hill (Season 1) DVD:Episode 1 (Pilot)Episode 2 (Square Peg)Episode 3 (The Order of the Straight Arrow)Episode 4 (Hank's Got the Willies)Episode 5 (Luanne's Saga)Episode 6 (Hank's Unmentionable Problem)Episode 7 (Westie Side Story)Episode 8 (Shins of the Father)Episode 9 (Peggy the Boggle Champ)Episode 10 (Keeping Up with Our Joneses)Episode 11 (King of the Ant Hill)Episode 12 (Plastic White Female)The DVD Report",5,Animated blue collar TV...,1113868800,"04 19, 2005",2005,2657,"['Initially', 'aired', 'following', '1997', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'King', 'Hill', 'discovered', 'instant', 'audience', 'niche', 'followed', 'show', 'loyally', 'ever', 'brainchild', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'creator', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'also', 'known', 'hit', 'movie', 'Office', 'Space', 'King', 'Hill', 'unique', 'animated', 'series', ""n't"", 'rely', 'cartoon', 'suspension', 'reality', 'outlandish', 'antics', 'fact', 'show', 'would', 'arguably', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'successful', 'were', 'not', 'animated', 'Nevertheless', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'voice', 'Hank', 'Hill', 'unique', 'brand', 'humor', 'make', 'King', 'Hill', 'must-see', 'TV', 'series', 'Set', 'fictional', 'town', 'Arlen', 'Texas', 'King', 'Hill', 'life', 'exploits', 'Hank', 'Hill', 'traditional', 'nuclear', 'family', 'Hank', 'red-state', 'propane', 'salesman', 'who', 'beer', 'apple', 'pie', 'constantly', 'inundated', 'modern', 'liberalism', 'grapples', 'demands', 'political', 'correctness', 'Hank', 'joined', 'wife', 'Peggy', 'substitute', 'teacher', 'son', 'Bobby', 'awkward', 'pre-pubescent', 'youth', 'trailer', 'park-like', 'live-in', 'niece', 'named', 'Luanne', 'Providing', 'added', 'comic', 'relief', 'series', 'are', 'Hank', 'off-the-wall', 'friends', 'Bill', 'Boomhauer', 'who', 'inaudible', 'Dale', 'who', 'everything', 'government', 'conspiracy', 'Hank', 'Laotian', 'neighbor', 'Kahn', 'daughter', 'Bobby', 'quite', 'fond', 'family', 'live', 'next', 'door', 'providing', 'Hank', 'continuing', 'dose', 'culture', 'shock', 'King', 'Hill', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'number', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'meet', 'first', 'time', 'various', 'characters', 'involved', 'Hank', 'Hill', 'life', 'Arlen', 'Texas', 'Bobby', 'hit', 'eye', 'baseball', 'prompting', 'social', 'worker', 'launch', 'investigation', 'filing', 'possible', 'child', 'abuse', 'charges', 'Hank', 'Meanwhile', 'Hank', 'niece', 'Luanne', 'aspiring', 'beautician', 'forced', 'move', 'Hank', 'family', 'mother', 'put', 'jail', 'stabbing', 'father', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '1', 'include', 'Square', 'Peg', 'Peggy', 'forced', 'teach', 'sexual', 'education', 'class', 'Hank', 'Unmentionable', 'Problem', 'Hank', 'constipated', 'much', 'chagrin', 'numerous', 'opinions', 'how', 'cure', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'King', 'Hill', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'Episode', '1', 'Pilot', 'Episode', '2', 'Square', 'Peg', 'Episode', '3', 'Order', 'Straight', 'Arrow', 'Episode', '4', 'Hank', 'Got', 'Willies', 'Episode', '5', 'Luanne', 'Saga', 'Episode', '6', 'Hank', 'Unmentionable', 'Problem', 'Episode', '7', 'Westie', 'Side', 'Story', 'Episode', '8', 'Shins', 'Father', 'Episode', '9', 'Peggy', 'Boggle', 'Champ', 'Episode', '10', 'Keeping', 'Up', 'Joneses', 'Episode', '11', 'King', 'Ant', 'Hill', 'Episode', '12', 'Plastic', 'White', 'Female', 'DVD', 'Report']",King of the Hill - The Complete First Season
612454,A3PFYGUA9E0V0M,B00005JM3G,"Bryan J. Peterson ""I'm not blind drunk, I'm j...","[1, 1]","I've been a fan of King of the Hill practically since it first aired on Fox. Quite apart from the voice acting, the stories are often hillariously funny, though unlike The Simpsons they don't resort to the same bizarre, out-of-this-world plots seen on Halloween shows.The first season is rather scanty with a mere twelve or thirteen episodes, but they're all well worth watching. In the pilot, Hank Hill, voiced by Mike Judge (and who sounds, incidentally, almost exactly like Tom Anderson from Beavis and Butthead except with a more robust voice), comes off as quick-tempered, even managing to find himself on the radar of an overzealous social worker determined to put Bobby, Hank's hapless son, into a better home.The adventures and misadventures don't stop at the pilot. Peggy's Sex Ed class, Peggy finds herself in the unlikely position of Sex Education teacher, much to Hank's chagrin. In Order of the Straight Arrow, the guys take the Boyscouts of Arlen on a disastrously ill-fated camping trip. Other highlights include Hank's got the Willies, in which Bobby inadvertently introduces the Hills to country great WIllie Nelson, Westy Side Story, which introduces us to Kahn and his wife Min and daughter, Kahn Junior, and let's not forget my personal favorite, Hank's Unmentionable Problem. And of course there are the classic moments of Hank catching Bobby smoking and deciding to punish him by making him smoke every cigarette in the carton and, in doing so, inadvertently addicting the entire family, all save Louanne and Ladybird, to Nicotine. Another classic is when Hank and Peggy catch Bobby practicing his kissing skills on a manequin head brought home from Louanne's beauty school.All in all, King of the Hill's first season is well worth watching. The extras on the DVD's, the commentary done by both showrunners, directors and some of the characters themselves (though it's not available on all episodes), is well worth taking a listen to.

612464,A12CW1NT0V48YZ,B00005JM3G,Jaime J. Weinman,"[34, 37]","The phrase you most often hear in connection with KING OF THE HILL is &quot;It grows on you.&quot; When it first appeared, a lot of people (including me) were surprised that it wasn't as outrageous as co-creator Mike Judge's &quot;Beavis and Butthead&quot; or as fast-paced as &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (which co-creator Greg Daniels used to work for). But once you get used to the characters and get to know their quirks, it becomes clear that KotH is one of the best sitcoms on TV: funny, surprisingly touching, and with a great cast of characters.The first season of 13 episodes is a great introduction to the show. The character designs and voices aren't quite as polished as they would become, but the actual animation is probably the most visually imaginative in the show's run, and in terms of storytelling and characterization the show hit its stride right away. Some of the best episodes are &quot;Plastic White Female,&quot; still one of the best episodes about Hank Hill (Mike Judge) and his son Bobby (Pamela Segall); &quot;Shins of the Father,&quot; which demonstrates the strength of character of Peggy (Kathy Najimy); and &quot;Luanne's Saga,&quot; about Hank's relationship with his niece Luanne Platter (the show lost a lot in season six when Luanne started to be absent from most episodes).  And the first season offered some of the show's most memorable comedy moments, like the botched threatening phone call from neighbor Dale Gribble (Johnny Hardwick), the first entrance of Dale's &quot;son&quot; Joseph (Brittany Murphy) and Hank's first meeting with obnoxious neighbor Kahn (Toby Huss).The 3 disc set will include a ton of extras.  There are audio commentaries on eight episodes: Two by co-creator Greg Daniels, two by director Klay Hall, and four in-character commentaries by some of the voice actors.  There's a new half-hour &quot;making-of&quot; documentary.  There are examples of early design sketches and basic animation poses for the main characters.  And best of all, there are deleted scenes from all the episodes (including the alternate ending to &quot;The Company Man&quot;).  And who can resist the chance to hear Peggy dubbed in fluent Spanish?

612468,A27VMEB55OY9LS,B00005JM3G,Kathy-W,"[0, 0]","Having lived in Texas for some years, this show was a great comfort to me when I had to move out of the state. I can vouch for the humor and characterizations you see in these episodes - some of it isn't so far from reality. The show is sometimes just this side of ribald, but almost never in poor taste. As far as humor is concerned, there's a good balance of characters, from the uptight ""Boy Scout"" Hank to the paranoid Dale to the puzzling Boomhauer. Bill is sometimes over-the-top fatuous, but he's such a gentle soul that you don't really mind his slobbish antics. Bobby's kind-hearted obliviousness to life is a sweet counterbalance to Hank's occasional tirades. This show had quite a lot of guest voices over the years, but they rarely felt like a forced presence, and the temporary characters were usually strategic and appropriate to the plot.Like many other reviews have said, adults will get a chuckle out of this show, but preteens and smart middle-schoolers will also enjoy it (although some ""Beavis & Butt-Head"" alums were also involved in this show, ""King of the Hill"" is pretty tame and actually holds up to multiple viewings).",5,"""Boy I tell you what,"" I miss this show",1372118400,"06 25, 2013",2013,1144,"['Having', 'lived', 'Texas', 'years', 'show', 'was', 'great', 'comfort', 'when', 'had', 'move', 'state', 'can', 'vouch', 'humor', 'characterizations', 'see', 'episodes', ""n't"", 'so', 'far', 'reality', 'show', 'sometimes', 'just', 'side', 'ribald', 'almost', 'never', 'poor', 'taste', 'As', 'far', 'humor', 'concerned', 'good', 'balance', 'characters', 'uptight', 'Boy', 'Scout', 'Hank', 'paranoid', 'Dale', 'puzzling', 'Boomhauer', 'Bill', 'sometimes', 'over-the-top', 'fatuous', 'such', 'gentle', 'soul', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'mind', 'slobbish', 'antics', 'Bobby', 'kind-hearted', 'obliviousness', 'life', 'sweet', 'counterbalance', 'Hank', 'occasional', 'tirades', 'show', 'had', 'quite', 'lot', 'guest', 'voices', 'years', 'rarely', 'felt', 'forced', 'presence', 'temporary', 'characters', 'were', 'usually', 'strategic', 'appropriate', 'plot.Like', 'many', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'said', 'adults', 'will', 'get', 'chuckle', 'show', 'preteens', 'smart', 'middle-schoolers', 'will', 'also', 'enjoy', 'Beavis', 'Butt-Head', 'alums', 'were', 'also', 'involved', 'show', 'King', 'Hill', 'pretty', 'tame', 'actually', 'multiple', 'viewings']",King of the Hill - The Complete First Season

I only consider one of the episodes in this DVD as one of the best ""King of the Hill"" episodes (The Pilot). Despite this, I found that most of the episodes found in this DVD were relatively entertaining and funny. The show itself is basically a satire the residents of Southern Texas, and one of the things that I found funny was that the characters are actually based on real people. I admit that some of the characters in this show are really annoying, specifically Peggy and Bobby, but disliking and disagreeing with a character is what makes a show fun to watch.I also want to point out that people from foreign countries who aren't familiar with Texas can misunderstand this kind of humor. Another reason that some people don't like ""King of the Hill"" is because it uses smarter humor. This show does not rely on stupidity to be funny, like many other comedies do. For instance, ""Family Guy,"" though a bit funny, is so mind-numbingly stupid that I can feel my brain shrinking every time I watch it. ""King of the Hill"" is not like that and is entertaining without being idiotic.My episode ratings:1. Pilot: 10/10, excellent way to begin a series2. Square Peg: 6/10; a bi ridiculous, but still funny.3. The Order of the Straight Arrow: 7/10; funny, but a bit annoying.4. Luanne's Saga: 8/105.

I was hoping maybe someone could explain to me why this show is funny.  I have watched several episodes (mostly because it comes on after Malcolm in the Middle, which i deem to be a far superior show even if its losing steam after 7 seasons) and maybe cracked a smile through a few of them, but i have never, to my recollection ever laughed.  I am not too picky with what i watch (except for reality tv which i think is the worst thing to hit america since 9/11) and like many different kinds of shows ex: Frasier, Seinfeld, Simpsons, Family Guy, Malcolm in the Middle, Lost, 24, Prison Break,and that 70's show.  But in my humble opinion in order for a show to go on you have to stop trying to be so damn smart (unless your the brilliant Arrested Development, which was unfortunately canceled:() and start trying to be funny.  And also the show has way to many touching moments.  The simpsons had them but didn't use them too much, and they only work once in a while because no one really cares if a cartoon dad loves his son no matter what, its a frikkin tv show.  Anyways, if someone could please politely explain what is so funny about this show, i would appreciate it.ps.

612477,AD39QGHGWAOPQ,B00005JM3G,"mwreview ""mwreview""","[10, 11]","This DVD set is the first I have ever purchased and I was pleasantly surprised at all the extra goodies that come with the very humorous and well done 13 episodes of the first season.  Judging from other reviews I've read, I probably will not find as many extras on other DVD sets.  Each disc is extremely easy to navigate, which is a big benefit to me because I had never operated a DVD player before.  The extras include promos, deleted and extended scenes (some with just sketches and audio), the Making of King of the Hill with the creators, voices, and animators, a Barenaked Ladies music video starring Dale Gribble, and commentaries on selected episodes by co-creator Greg Daniels, director Klay Hall, and some of the characters.  The commentaries I found to be a little boring and not well rehearsed.  The best commentary was of the episode &quot;Shins of the Father&quot; by Peggy and Bobby Hill.  The voice of Peggy does an excellent job bringing her character's personality into the commentary with very funny results.  The commentary of &quot;Westie Side Story&quot; by Dale and Bill is also very good.  The characters seem all too real.  Another interesting extra is the &quot;Do's and Don't's&quot; list used by the animators for drawing the characters correctly.  Every detail is scrutinized including the eye movements, finger placement, the proper color to use when liquid spills on clothing, what should be seen through windows, Dale's cigarette positioning, etc.  Much time and care is taken into this program to make it as realistic as possible, and it definitely shows in this DVD set. And, of course, the episodes are great including my favorite &quot;Hank's Unmentionable Problem.&quot;  This series had it right from the beginning.  Hank, himself, would be proud of this set, &quot;I tell you what.&quot;",5,An Excellent Collection of K.o.t.H. and K.o.t.H.

612490,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00005JM3G,trebe,"[5, 5]","In 1997, Greg Daniels and Mike Judge the creator of Beavis and Butthead, debuted their new animated series King of the Hill (KOTH) on FOX.  Following the everyday life of a man named Hank Hill (voiced by Judge) and dealing with many real life issues, KOTH would become one the cool family based animated comedies from the 1990's.  Critically acclaimed and in tune with FOX, the series would eventually run for 13 seasons, producing 259 episodes.Hank Hill lives in Arlen, Texas, with his wife Peggy (voiced by Kathy Najimy), his son Bobby (voiced by Pamela Segall), and his niece Luanne Platter (voiced by Brittany Murphy).  Hank is employed at Strictland Petroleum selling ""propane and propane accessories"".  Three of Hank's closest friends from high school are his neighbors, Jeff Boomhauer (also voiced by Mike Judge), Dale Dribble (voiced by Johnny Hardwick), and Bill Dauterive (voiced by Steven Root).A midseason replacement, Season One contains just 13 episodes, most of which are very well written and uniquely quirky, as KOTH deals with subjects and situations on the domestic front, and also in the workplace.  In an era that saw the rise of political correctness, KOTH does not back away from controversy, exploring some offbeat subjects and edgy topics.  Living in Texas, holding generally conservative family values, health issues, and the propane business, are just some of the diverse factors that are in play.KOTH jumps into the fire from the start, as in the pilot episode a completely innocent Hank is being investigated by a child protective agency, for possibly abusing his son.  Already suffering from a narrow urethra, Hank's constipation is explored in the hilarious episode ""Hank's Unmentionable Problem"".  In ""Keeping Up With Our Joneses"" 12-year old Bobby gets caught smoking, which eventually leads to his parents, both ex-smokers, taking up the habit again.  Hank's crusty father Cotton Hill (voiced by Toby Huss) is introduced in ""Shins Of The Father"".  Cotton's abrasive personality, prejudice, and lack of respect for women, is offensive, and becomes a bad influence on those he meets.  In ""Westie Side Story"", Hank and his friends are not sure how to react when a Laotian family moves into their neighborhood.  Luanne is training to be a beautician, and has no idea that Bobby is using her hairstyling model of a woman head, to practice his romantic techniques in ""Plastic White Female"".While not everything works, and some may find the subject matter offensive, King of the Hill quickly developed an appreciative audience.  Taking a look at life in middle-America, and with its own particular vernacular, many found KOTH's point of view fresh and funny, kind of like a 90's version of The Beverly Hillbillies, and I tell you whut, that's not bad company at all.  The 13 subtitled episodes are on three discs, and contain some nice extras including lots of deleted scenes.",4,welcome to life in Arlen Texas...,1322956800,"12 4, 2011",2011,2903,"['1997', 'Greg', 'Daniels', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'creator', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'debuted', 'new', 'animated', 'series', 'King', 'Hill', 'KOTH', 'FOX', 'Following', 'everyday', 'life', 'man', 'named', 'Hank', 'Hill', 'voiced', 'Judge', 'dealing', 'many', 'real', 'life', 'issues', 'KOTH', 'would', 'become', 'one', 'cool', 'family', 'based', 'animated', 'comedies', '1990', 'Critically', 'acclaimed', 'tune', 'FOX', 'series', 'would', 'eventually', 'run', '13', 'seasons', 'producing', '259', 'episodes.Hank', 'Hill', 'Arlen', 'Texas', 'wife', 'Peggy', 'voiced', 'Kathy', 'Najimy', 'son', 'Bobby', 'voiced', 'Pamela', 'Segall', 'niece', 'Luanne', 'Platter', 'voiced', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'Hank', 'employed', 'Strictland', 'Petroleum', 'selling', 'propane', 'propane', 'accessories', 'Three', 'Hank', 'closest', 'friends', 'high', 'school', 'are', 'neighbors', 'Jeff', 'Boomhauer', 'also', 'voiced', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'Dale', 'Dribble', 'voiced', 'Johnny', 'Hardwick', 'Bill', 'Dauterive', 'voiced', 'Steven', 'Root', '.A', 'midseason', 'replacement', 'Season', 'One', 'just', '13', 'episodes', 'most', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'uniquely', 'quirky', 'KOTH', 'deals', 'subjects', 'situations', 'domestic', 'front', 'also', 'workplace', 'era', 'saw', 'rise', 'political', 'correctness', 'KOTH', 'not', 'back', 'away', 'controversy', 'exploring', 'offbeat', 'subjects', 'edgy', 'topics', 'Living', 'Texas', 'holding', 'generally', 'conservative', 'family', 'values', 'health', 'issues', 'propane', 'business', 'are', 'just', 'diverse', 'factors', 'are', 'play.KOTH', 'jumps', 'fire', 'start', 'pilot', 'episode', 'completely', 'innocent', 'Hank', 'being', 'investigated', 'child', 'protective', 'agency', 'possibly', 'abusing', 'son', 'Already', 'suffering', 'narrow', 'urethra', 'Hank', 'constipation', 'explored', 'hilarious', 'episode', 'Hank', 'Unmentionable', 'Problem', 'Keeping', 'Up', 'Joneses', '12-year', 'old', 'Bobby', 'caught', 'smoking', 'eventually', 'parents', 'ex-smokers', 'taking', 'up', 'habit', 'again', 'Hank', 'crusty', 'father', 'Cotton', 'Hill', 'voiced', 'Toby', 'Huss', 'introduced', 'Shins', 'Father', 'Cotton', 'abrasive', 'personality', 'prejudice', 'lack', 'respect', 'women', 'offensive', 'bad', 'influence', 'Westie', 'Side', 'Story', 'Hank', 'friends', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'react', 'when', 'Laotian', 'family', 'moves', 'neighborhood', 'Luanne', 'training', 'be', 'beautician', 'idea', 'Bobby', 'using', 'hairstyling', 'model', 'woman', 'head', 'practice', 'romantic', 'techniques', 'Plastic', 'White', 'Female', 'not', 'everything', 'works', 'may', 'find', 'subject', 'matter', 'offensive', 'King', 'Hill', 'quickly', 'developed', 'appreciative', 'audience', 'Taking', 'look', 'life', 'middle-America', 'own', 'particular', 'vernacular', 'many', 'found', 'KOTH', 'point', 'view', 'fresh', 'funny', 'kind', '90', 'version', 'Beverly', 'Hillbillies', 'tell', 'whut', 'not', 'bad', 'company', '13', 'subtitled', 'episodes', 'are', 'three', 'discs', 'contain', 'nice', 'extras', 'including', 'lots', 'deleted', 'scenes']",King of the Hill - The Complete First Season
