Hernandez Jr. ""jdhtampa""","[7, 12]","Although I have not seen this movie on the DVD format, I can say I saw it on VHS, and it's a clean wholesome family movie of a girl coming of age story in the south during the 50's. The story focuses on the family itself and the growing pains of a girl with no siblings.(Taken from VHS cover....Based on the award winning book, ""My Louisiana Sky"" is a heartfelt portrait of one girl's emotional journey to a place she'd always dreamed of and the road back home.)I rated it three stars cause I grew up with brothers, and there was little for me to relate to in this movie, Its a family kind of Hallmark film. I don't know if the movie has a rating, but its a definite G rating movie. Its kind of in the genre of ""Old Yeller"" by Disney.",3,A cute family movie,1021939200,"05 21, 2002",2002,734,"['have', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'DVD', 'format', 'can', 'say', 'saw', 'VHS', 'clean', 'wholesome', 'family', 'movie', 'girl', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'south', '50', 'story', 'family', 'growing', 'pains', 'girl', 'siblings', 'Taken', 'VHS', 'cover', '.Based', 'award', 'winning', 'book', 'Louisiana', 'Sky', 'heartfelt', 'portrait', 'one', 'girl', 'emotional', 'journey', 'place', ""'d"", 'always', 'dreamed', 'road', 'back', 'home', 'rated', 'three', 'stars', 'cause', 'grew', 'up', 'brothers', 'was', 'little', 'relate', 'movie', 'family', 'kind', 'Hallmark', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'rating', 'definite', 'G', 'rating', 'movie', 'kind', 'genre', 'Old', 'Yeller', 'Disney']",My Louisiana Sky

Growing up with a disabled mother myself, I completely realated to the young girl.  I couldn't stop crying all the way through.  The ending left me wanting more.  We just got a brief snipit of the lives of the characters.  I would definitely welcome a sequel.  It is just a heart-warming movie that I think all would enjoy.
