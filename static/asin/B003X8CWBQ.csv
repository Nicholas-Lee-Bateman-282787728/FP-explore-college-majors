But where the film fails is in its unapologetic look at the behavior of some of the players.  Robert Bailey's obvious glee at purposely knocking out another player is one example.  Randall Hill refusing to take responsibility for imbecilic post-TD idiocy at the Cotton Bowl is another.  While I applaud the work done by guys who came out of troubled neighborhoods, I also know basic sportsmanship and right and wrong.  To justify that behavior behind quasi-rascist screen of ""cultural differences"" is an insult to the audience.",3,Fascinating but flawed,1319760000,"10 28, 2011",2011,755,"['grew', 'up', 'watching', 'University', 'Miami', 'dominate', 'college', 'football', 'did', 'fascinating', 'review', 'how', 'program', 'was', 'built', 'up', 'nothing', 'then', 'sustained', 'multiple', 'head', 'coaches', '1990', 'where', 'film', 'unapologetic', 'look', 'behavior', 'players', 'Robert', 'Bailey', 'obvious', 'glee', 'purposely', 'knocking', 'out', 'player', 'one', 'example', 'Randall', 'Hill', 'refusing', 'take', 'responsibility', 'imbecilic', 'post-TD', 'idiocy', 'Cotton', 'Bowl', 'applaud', 'work', 'done', 'guys', 'who', 'came', 'troubled', 'neighborhoods', 'also', 'know', 'basic', 'sportsmanship', 'right', 'wrong', 'justify', 'behavior', 'quasi-rascist', 'screen', 'cultural', 'differences', 'insult', 'audience']",ESPN Films 30 for 30: The U
1370331,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B003X8CWBQ,Patrick L. Randall,"[1, 1]","For a 10-year span, running from the 1983 season through the 1992 season, there were was simply no better team in college football than the Miami Hurricanes.  They were on a run of dominance that rivals all other dynasties in the long history of the college game.  In that 10-season span, Miami won 4 National Titles; they lost in the title game two other times; AND, in another two seasons were one, very narrow, regular season loss away from competing for the title again.  Oh, and they did this by being the most unapologetic, loud-mouth, obnoxious and absurdly talented team in the nation.""The U"" is another episode in ESPN's great 30 for 30 series, and it covers a time when the Hurricanes were to college football what the Raiders of the 70's and 80's were to the NFL.  Trash talking, strutting and showing off seem common place to fans these days.  When the Hurricanes ascended to their first National Title under Howard Schnellenberger, and then soared to new heights under the brash Jimmy Johnson, no one had ever seen something like this.  These were players who didn't behave like 'good little children', which was expected by college administrators (including University of Miami 'stuffed shirt' President, Tad Foote, and behind the times Athletic Director, Sam Jankovich)As entertaining as it is to relive the grid-iron beat-downs that Miami leveled on its opponents (46-3 over Texas in the Cotton Bowl ring a bell??), ""The U"" goes beyond the hi-jinks.  Director Billy Corben (also responsible for the stunning expose ""Broke"") knows how to tell the story about how the Hurricanes, once a team that was so irrelevant that tickets were given away at the local McDonald's, became not only the best team in college football, but a symbol and an opportunity to a whole host of young athletes who grew up in the slums of Miami and Coral Gables.  They now had something to root for and something to try and strive to be a part of.  This is a because Schnellenberger (and later, Jimmy Johnson) knew how to reach out to these kids that the rest of the schools were ignoring as 'unsavory'.There are some great moments to this episode, such as the controversy surrounding Luther Campbell's (of 2 Live Crew) largesse towards the players and the 'walkout' against Penn State in the pre-game dinner before the 1986 Title Game.  The episode also gets a little sloppy in other areas.  It's laughable to hear from coach Dennis Erickson, and former player Mario Cristobal, gush about how impressive it was for Miami to have an undefeated season.  The treated it like it was a rare occurrence when, in fact, at least 2-4 teams each year go undefeated (meaning half can't even compete for the title).  The other sloppy area is the portrayal of the program going downhill when Butch Davis took over as coach.  In truth, the program was devastated by penalties and probation from the end of the Erickson era.  Davis rebuilt the Hurricanes to the point where they were competing in major bowls again by the end of the 90's, and he set the foundation for the National Title (Miami's 5th!) that the school won under Larry Coker in 2001.The awesome impact of the Hurricanes is witnessed by how many 1st-round draft picks there were in the NFL (many of whom continued to play great in the pros).  This is a throwback to a different time.  Even with Alabama's recent run of dominance (3 titles in 4 years), they still don't seem to be near the juggernaut that ""The U"" was in the 80's and 90's",5,Fabulously entertaining chronicle of the 'Bad Boys' of college football,1372636800,"07 1, 2013",2013,3477,"['10-year', 'span', 'running', '1983', 'season', '1992', 'season', 'were', 'was', 'simply', 'better', 'team', 'college', 'football', 'Miami', 'Hurricanes', 'were', 'run', 'dominance', 'rivals', 'other', 'dynasties', 'long', 'history', 'college', 'game', '10-season', 'span', 'Miami', 'won', '4', 'National', 'Titles', 'lost', 'title', 'game', 'two', 'other', 'times', 'AND', 'two', 'seasons', 'were', 'one', 'very', 'narrow', 'regular', 'season', 'loss', 'away', 'competing', 'title', 'again', 'Oh', 'did', 'being', 'most', 'unapologetic', 'loud-mouth', 'obnoxious', 'absurdly', 'talented', 'team', 'nation', 'U', 'episode', 'ESPN', 'great', '30', '30', 'series', 'time', 'when', 'Hurricanes', 'were', 'college', 'football', 'what', 'Raiders', '70', '80', 'were', 'NFL', 'Trash', 'talking', 'strutting', 'showing', 'off', 'seem', 'common', 'place', 'fans', 'days', 'When', 'Hurricanes', 'ascended', 'first', 'National', 'Title', 'Howard', 'Schnellenberger', 'then', 'soared', 'new', 'heights', 'brash', 'Jimmy', 'Johnson', 'one', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'something', 'were', 'players', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'behave', 'little', 'children', 'was', 'expected', 'college', 'administrators', 'including', 'University', 'Miami', ""'stuffed"", 'shirt', 'President', 'Tad', 'Foote', 'times', 'Athletic', 'Director', 'Sam', 'Jankovich', 'As', 'entertaining', 'relive', 'grid-iron', 'beat-downs', 'Miami', 'leveled', 'opponents', '46-3', 'Texas', 'Cotton', 'Bowl', 'ring', 'bell', 'U', 'hi-jinks', 'Director', 'Billy', 'Corben', 'also', 'responsible', 'stunning', 'expose', 'Broke', 'how', 'tell', 'story', 'how', 'Hurricanes', 'once', 'team', 'was', 'so', 'irrelevant', 'tickets', 'were', 'given', 'away', 'local', 'McDonald', 'became', 'not', 'only', 'best', 'team', 'college', 'football', 'symbol', 'opportunity', 'whole', 'host', 'young', 'athletes', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'slums', 'Miami', 'Coral', 'Gables', 'now', 'had', 'something', 'root', 'something', 'try', 'strive', 'be', 'part', 'because', 'Schnellenberger', 'later', 'Jimmy', 'Johnson', 'knew', 'how', 'reach', 'out', 'kids', 'rest', 'schools', 'were', 'ignoring', 'are', 'great', 'moments', 'episode', 'such', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'Luther', 'Campbell', '2', 'Live', 'Crew', 'largesse', 'players', ""'walkout"", 'Penn', 'State', 'pre-game', 'dinner', '1986', 'Title', 'Game', 'episode', 'also', 'little', 'sloppy', 'other', 'areas', 'laughable', 'hear', 'coach', 'Dennis', 'Erickson', 'former', 'player', 'Mario', 'Cristobal', 'gush', 'how', 'impressive', 'was', 'Miami', 'have', 'undefeated', 'season', 'treated', 'was', 'rare', 'occurrence', 'when', 'fact', 'least', '2-4', 'teams', 'year', 'go', 'undefeated', 'meaning', 'half', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'compete', 'title', 'other', 'sloppy', 'area', 'portrayal', 'program', 'going', 'downhill', 'when', 'Butch', 'Davis', 'took', 'over', 'coach', 'truth', 'program', 'was', 'devastated', 'penalties', 'probation', 'end', 'Erickson', 'era', 'Davis', 'rebuilt', 'Hurricanes', 'point', 'where', 'were', 'competing', 'major', 'bowls', 'again', 'end', '90', 'set', 'foundation', 'National', 'Title', 'Miami', '5th', 'school', 'won', 'Larry', 'Coker', '2001.The', 'awesome', 'impact', 'Hurricanes', 'witnessed', 'how', 'many', '1st-round', 'draft', 'picks', 'were', 'NFL', 'many', 'whom', 'continued', 'play', 'great', 'pros', 'throwback', 'different', 'time', 'Even', 'Alabama', 'recent', 'run', 'dominance', '3', 'titles', '4', 'years', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'juggernaut', 'U', 'was', '80', '90']",ESPN Films 30 for 30: The U
