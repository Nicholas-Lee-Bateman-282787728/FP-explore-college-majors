1442504,A6J7UPYUI96XO,B0055CP9DQ,"Cory T. Shaeffer ""HockeyFanatic""","[5, 7]","Well, for starters, there is a blonde lead actress playing the part of a single mother named Rachel. There is a dead girl who is haunting her and her child. There are secrets buried within the walls, and a mystery from decades ago about how the young girl met her untimely demise. An attempt made to set the girl's spirit free only makes things worse.And I am NOT talking about the movie ""The Ring.""Although derivative and at times slow-paced, this film does deliver a chilling moment or two. The acting is stellar (Geri Ryan is not only attractive but extremely talented, and Marianne Jean-Baptiste is always outstanding in her roles.) THe two daughters are convincing as well.The plot is nothing new, and if you've seen ""The Ring,"" ""Skeleton Key,"" or ""Stir of Echoes"" then there is nothing in this film that you have not seen before. But I guess if you're going to borrow ideas from past films, at least borrow them from good ones, which this movie does. And despite the cliches and the fact that because of the TV rating, there is not much about this ghost that is sinister or evil, it is still a good ghost story if you are in the mood for one.This is a perfect film for someone who does not like gore, but loves a good haunted house story with good acting.",4,Not Bad For A Lifetime Movie,1318550400,"10 14, 2011",2011,1261,"['Well', 'starters', 'blonde', 'lead', 'actress', 'playing', 'part', 'single', 'mother', 'named', 'Rachel', 'dead', 'girl', 'who', 'haunting', 'child', 'are', 'secrets', 'buried', 'walls', 'mystery', 'decades', 'ago', 'how', 'young', 'girl', 'met', 'untimely', 'demise', 'attempt', 'made', 'set', 'girl', 'spirit', 'free', 'only', 'things', 'worse.And', 'am', 'NOT', 'talking', 'movie', 'Ring', 'derivative', 'times', 'slow-paced', 'film', 'deliver', 'chilling', 'moment', 'two', 'acting', 'stellar', 'Geri', 'Ryan', 'not', 'only', 'attractive', 'extremely', 'talented', 'Marianne', 'Jean-Baptiste', 'always', 'outstanding', 'roles', 'THe', 'two', 'daughters', 'are', 'convincing', 'well.The', 'plot', 'nothing', 'new', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Ring', 'Skeleton', 'Key', 'Stir', 'Echoes', 'then', 'nothing', 'film', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'before', 'guess', ""'re"", 'going', 'borrow', 'ideas', 'past', 'films', 'least', 'borrow', 'good', 'ones', 'movie', 'cliches', 'fact', 'TV', 'rating', 'not', 'much', 'ghost', 'sinister', 'evil', 'still', 'good', 'ghost', 'story', 'are', 'mood', 'one.This', 'perfect', 'film', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'gore', 'good', 'haunted', 'house', 'story', 'good', 'acting']",Secrets in the Walls

Liked the resolution and Jeri Ryan was very enjoyable.  You know how the people always go down into the dark & creepy basement when they KNOW they shouldn't?  Didn't happen so much in this film - they seemed to react more like I'd think real people would - protecting their kids but not being silly.We had a problem with the first dvd that we ordered and Amazon fixed our problem for us even though it was after the 30 days time frame to return it.THANK YOU Amazon!!!!

1442507,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B0055CP9DQ,Einsatz,"[0, 0]","Fairly generic in its approach, probably because it was done for television, this ghost story is held aloft by the actors who made the characters people we can feel something for.  I especially liked young Molly (Peyton R. List) and the always fabulous Marianne Jean-Baptiste.  The story is hardly challenging and the ghost is more pitiful than predatory.  Much of the story's bite involves ""suggestion"" rather than overt horror.  This is a lot like the timid horror movies they used to produce in the 60s.  This is not the stuff of nightmares.  It does make you wonder though about the next house you might buy.Enjoyable for its type.",3,Home Sweet Home,1316995200,"09 26, 2011",2011,635,"['Fairly', 'generic', 'approach', 'probably', 'was', 'done', 'television', 'ghost', 'story', 'held', 'aloft', 'actors', 'who', 'made', 'characters', 'people', 'can', 'feel', 'something', 'especially', 'liked', 'young', 'Molly', 'Peyton', 'R.', 'List', 'always', 'fabulous', 'Marianne', 'Jean-Baptiste', 'story', 'hardly', 'challenging', 'ghost', 'more', 'pitiful', 'predatory', 'Much', 'story', 'bite', 'suggestion', 'rather', 'overt', 'horror', 'lot', 'timid', 'horror', 'movies', 'used', 'produce', '60s', 'not', 'stuff', 'nightmares', 'make', 'wonder', 'next', 'house', 'might', 'buy.Enjoyable', 'type']",Secrets in the Walls
1442508,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B0055CP9DQ,Michael Butts,"[0, 1]","Why is it that when weird things happen in a new house the people just don't move?  Such is the dilemma in this rather tame spook tale.  Jeri Ryan stars as a recently divorced mother who moves her two daughters to Detroit to start a new life.  Through a rather contrived coincidence, she buys a house near her new job and needless to say, strange things happen.  Also conveniently, her youngest daughter AND her new co-worker (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) have psychic abilities, and daughter has ""bad feelings"" about the new house.  Ryan learns that in the 50s a young bride mysteriously vanished.  Of course we know where she went.  The movie is slowly paced and nothing really horrifying occurs.  The ghost is just not that frightening.  Ryan and Baptiste are competent actresses trapped in clich&eacute; roles while Kay Pannabaker's transformation is minimal and unconvincing.  I'm guessing this is a Lifetime TV movie, so it's ""tameness"" is understandable.  SECRETS IN THE WALLS is mildly entertaining if your expectations are low",3,LET ME OUT!,1320105600,"11 1, 2011",2011,1030,"['Why', 'when', 'weird', 'things', 'happen', 'new', 'house', 'people', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'move', 'Such', 'dilemma', 'rather', 'tame', 'spook', 'tale', 'Jeri', 'Ryan', 'recently', 'divorced', 'mother', 'who', 'two', 'daughters', 'Detroit', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'rather', 'contrived', 'coincidence', 'house', 'new', 'job', 'needless', 'say', 'strange', 'things', 'happen', 'Also', 'conveniently', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'new', 'co-worker', 'Marianne', 'Jean-Baptiste', 'have', 'psychic', 'abilities', 'daughter', 'bad', 'feelings', 'new', 'house', 'Ryan', '50s', 'young', 'bride', 'mysteriously', 'vanished', 'course', 'know', 'where', 'went', 'movie', 'slowly', 'paced', 'nothing', 'really', 'horrifying', 'occurs', 'ghost', 'just', 'not', 'frightening', 'Ryan', 'Baptiste', 'are', 'competent', 'actresses', 'trapped', 'clich', 'eacute', 'roles', 'Kay', 'Pannabaker', 'transformation', 'minimal', 'unconvincing', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'Lifetime', 'TV', 'movie', 'tameness', 'understandable', 'SECRETS', 'IN', 'THE', 'WALLS', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'expectations', 'are', 'low']",Secrets in the Walls

1442515,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B0055CP9DQ,Z Hayes,"[16, 18]","Most Lifetime movies are generic, and though Secrets in the Walls is your basic haunted house story, the performances and chilling effects, plus a couple of twists keep this movie fresh. Jeri Ryan plays single mom Rachel who finds herself buying her dream house on the spur of the moment. Even though the house is huge and in a nice neighborhood, the real estate agent persuades Rachel to purchase it, sweetening the deal with a rock bottom sale price. Now, any reasonable person would question why a house that large and beautiful can be so affordable? Well, Rachel is a newly-divorced mom of two girls, and desperately needs a change of scene, so her desperation might explain why she buys the house without asking too many questions.As soon as Rachel moves into her new home with her two daughters, the younger daughter Molly (Peyton List in a very credible performance) begins to voice her discomfort as she realizes there is something not quite right with their house. Molly is a budding psychic, but of course, no one takes her seriously. It is only when sinister things begin to plague the family, and older daughter Lizzie (Kay Panabaker) begins to show some behavioral changes, does Rachel take things seriously.When Rachel realizes that their home is haunted by a restless spirit, she begins to dig into the house's past, and makes some startling discoveries. There is a lot of suspense in the movie, though it is not without flaws. Jeri Ryan's acting is exaggerated at times, and some of the scenes where the ghost appears reminds one of apparitions from a J-horror movie. Nevertheless, the movie has some truly chilling moments, and there is a twist in the movie that captured me by surprise. This is one of the best supernatural-themed Lifetime movies I've watched in a long time.
