I came to the table late for this HBO offering, and after happening upon season two I fell head over heels in love (all over again!) with Larry David's genius. After tax refund time it was a must to invest in the box set of seasons 1-6. Follow the arc of Larry David playing himself (a successful Hollywood comedian/writer/sitcom creator) as he deals with everyday annoyances and outrages. We learn that while Larry has problems, money isn't one of them, and despite his wealth and prestige, Larry still has to deal with trauma, drama, misunderstandings, and mayhem in West L.A. The Seinfeld formula is followed somewhat, with disparate, seemingly unconnected, and often trivial events leading to incredible, crazy conclusions. Jeff Garlin is pure joy to watch as Larry's manager, complete with a remarkably actualized hellcat of a wife (Susie Essman). Richard Lewis is marvelous as Larry's dysfunctional fellow comedian (catchphrase: ""I'm a recovering alcoholic and I have intimacy issues""), and Cheryl Hines is a delight as Larry's oft-annoyed wife who loves to go out to dinner. A single withering look from the fictional Mrs. David can bring me into paroxysms of laughter. A true ensemble piece, Curb Your Enthusiasm is anchored by Larry David's brilliance, originality, and mordant wit. After a tough day at the salt mines, ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" punches my ticket back to sanity.

1128162,AEGLLY9CXWXX3,B0010YVC9I,"Halifax Student Account ""a-beautiful-idea""","[2, 8]","Genius comedy is rare, with the rubbish coming out the udders of mass culture, and all that, but thankfully, Curb Your Enthusiasm ranks with the brightest and the best telly can offer. Larry David is an absolute genius, like Ricky Gervais and Woody Allen, but funnier and cleverer at the same time. I love his writing and rank Curb with The Office and Cheers as one of funniest shows ever. My girlfriend however noticed a very funny thing about the casting that most people, including me, missed. When she told me, it made me smile (for once). She reckons that Larry David has basically cast himself as David Duchovny's Hank Moody character from Californication, and not just cast, but David is passing himself off as Hanks twin brother! Even stranger is that nobody has spotted the age issue. I would first like to list a few examples of the similarity of both shows, and then I will laugh at Larry David.Here are two examples, from off the top of my head. Both shows are set in Hollywood and star successful writers who are living off their past productions; we can say that they are semi-retired. Both Larry David and Hank Moody are fish out of water types, like Crocodile Dundee, thus they can see things others can't. Also, the best friend of Larry David and Hank Moody is his agent, who has a plush office and who wants to get off with his secretary, etc. Both characters roam around the Hollywood rich set, with not much to do; this backdrop supplies the social commentary for the thrust of both shows.In Californication, David Duchovny is harassed by teenage girls, who force him to have sex and take drugs; cue hilarious story-lines in Californication.In Curb Your Enthusiasm, Larry David's character is constantly harassed and bothered by poor people, that is, Hollywood's zero's who work in shopping malls and restaurants, and who dare to appear in front of Larry David's face; grrr!! Cue hilarious adventures.So when David Duchovny's coolness forced his ego to get off with beautiful teenagers and sneer in a cool manner, Larry David's character is forced to sneer in an aloof but funny manner. And it goes deeper that that (see below).So we see Larry David arguing with a waiter over why he should pay a tip, this would be funny if it wasn't for Larry David's own admission that he is indeed a millionaire, and so the joke didn't hurt my sides as advertised (Larry David must really fancy himself as a persecuted victim of those horrid Murlocks from H.G. Wells: The Time Machine, as he actually wrote this scene). Funnier still, Larry David hilariously shouts down aggressive female nurses who display annoying behaviour, like attending sick cues (those annoying sick people!) and he gets the once in a lifetime opportunity to humiliate a ridiculous shoe salesman (you have to see it for yourself). Larry David's must be completely out of touch if he believes that laughing at workers is a source of insight. What's his next trick, bringing back sterilisation for the poor?I am not defending poor people, because, well I suppose that if the main character is a handsome sort of sex symbol, like Hank Moody, then we have an American Psycho on our hands and this would be a character out of a Dostoevsky novel and would be very watchable. In Californication, Hank Moody is close to the above, but he was too busy getting raped by teenage girls and so the writers of Californication missed out on a classic dark comedy. In Curb, Larry David does indeed sneer at the poor and the huddled masses, unfortunately, Larry David is not Hank Moody. Larry is an old man, sorry!Larry David, you see, plays is as an angst ridden young man playing a much younger man with equally intense sarcasm and vanity. A big problem I found with Larry David's angst ridden dark star of fate persona, is when he does his looking away and sneering aloof at the absurdity of people and life situations etc, he just looks like a grumpy old man. This spoilt the effect for me as I do not think that Larry David had this in mind when he wrote the script. Now if David Duchovny played Larry's role, things would be different. If you haven't seen Californication, well trust me, Duchovny was brilliant in it, and Curb Your Enthusiasm is so similar, that Larry David should have cast the younger David in his shoes. With Duchovny in Larry's shoes, we can easily imagine a classic dark masterpiece. Duchovny's hero is a sneeringly repressed Hollywood writer, who sees himself as a crucified Heideggerian God; he disparagingly condemns the mind-set of the self regarding moneyed comrades he is forced to toil with, on a day to day basis, and he especially wags his finger at the local poor loser class. This is not as dramatic a description as it appears, because Larry David obviously fancies himself as the `above-all-this' man. With Duchovny starring, Curb Your Enthusiasm would be even funnier that American Psycho!You see, I'm all for rugged anti hero's, because the genre allows the bad ass hero a few decades in their self perpetuating mischief of angriness to grow and redeem (so Duchovny's Hank Moody is allowed to sleep and drug schoolgirls because we are safe in the knowledge that he will eventual learn and grow); this is why the anti hero genre works, because it taps into our unconscious expectation of allowing the anti-hero time to become a better person. However, when the hero is pushing 70, well it doesn't work on a human level because we except inner growth to have hit the spot by then and thus wisdom to have flowered; we do not expect the successful man, approaching the great beyond, to act like an existential teenager.Now then, all this intellectual flagellation is unconscious remember, so I still laughed along with everybody else. Just my personal bias talking here and Curb Your Enthusiasm is still a masterpiece and Larry David is a great writer. Though you could argue that he only writes for millionaires and for those who believe that millionairehood is a mere few generations away. If you find shouting at the plebs and condemning their taste in shoes hilarious and if you yearn for Victorian values, but in a funny way, then you will love this. I loved it too, but I did feel guilty for doing so, so I'll let myself off!Curb Your Enthusiasm will go down in the annals of rib ticklers that reached the very heights of absurdist masterpieces. It really is brilliant, with superb production values and labyrinthine plot devises that always fall into very funny places. Though it is hard to feel any empathy with millionaires, but this show probably wasn't written for me and my girlfriend. Larry David has been filthy rich for so many years.Now this age issue is the weirdest part of Curb; nobody in this sitcom even notices that Larry David is pushing 70! So his wife looks like his much younger sister (I won't say daughter because of the disturbing imagery, though there is a very funny incest episode, so now I don't know what to think!) and Larry's two best friends speak to our hero as equals, they being an entire generation younger and all, and Larry's attitude to young girls is confusing, I mean, why would an old man act like this to a young girl? Well the answer must be that Larry is pretending to be equal in age to the youngsters. For example, a young an sexy Hank Moody would not look out of place acting all competitive and horrid to young girls (his age), but he would if he was 65. Hand Moody can also insult his friends parents, Larry David can't. So when Larry is forced to apologise to his buds Jewish parents, well, it just didn't work because Larry David is in the same generation as the Jewish parents. If you watch it you must admit that Larry does cast himself as a much younger man.Larry should, however, be commended in this writing skill though, he's that good. I'm only commenting on the miscasting. If Larry shaved his bushy sides, like Sean Connery does, and if he wore sharp clothes, he would have gotten away with the angry old man routine, but he doesn't do this. He grows his sideburns to Charles Darwin bushiness and wears old people's clothes (well the cloths he wore in the 70's, but he was young back then so it looked cool) and he makes no reference to his age in his script, which is weird. This leads the viewer to believe that Larry David is trying to be younger! I'm sorry but that is the only explanation I can think of.Ok, I'm aware that I'm coming across as somewhat patronising to old people, like I'm expecting them to morph into the Dalai Lama on their 64th birthday or something... Ok, I guess I am expecting them to morph into the Dalai Lama on their 64th birthday!If you don't believe me on the miscasting thing, then watch the incest episode, when Larry is with his wife and they bump into Larry's impressive ex girlfriend. She was waaaay too young for him and, more importantly, we see Larry David's wife feeling uncomfortable and so she makes sarcastic comments about the girls' impressive boobs. You would think that she would mention the ex's very young age? I reckon that the wife mentioning the young girls' boobs is a natural defence mechanism. You see, when confronted with a better rival, I would picture the wife giving the feminist line about men only being interested is swelling breasts and this is why she mentioned the girls boobs; but you would also expect the wife to make a snide reference to the age-gap (to give herself a sense of superior oomph, and all that). But this age issue is never ever mentioned in all episodes. And at the end of the incest episode, we meet Larry's uncle. Did you not think that the uncle looked like a 90 year old to balance out Larry's old age? Also the bit were Larry hilariously gets stuck in a box with Ted Danson's old mother in-law, that didn't work either, because, you guessed it; our hero is the same age as the mother in-law. Larry David needed to hire a younger guy to play this part. I really do not mean to be ageist; I am not. I just think that Larry David must have a huge ego to feed (he uses his name `Larry' in the program remember) if he thinks he can pull off the smooth but semidetached existential hero. Ok, he may be a comic writer of the first order, but why not just stay behind the camera? Why take on the reins of your masterpiece and insist on being the main hunky guy? It's analogous to Steven Spielberg elbowing Harrison Ford aside because he's the director and he's going to be Indiana Jones! God, the guy must be a walking beacon of insecurity. Apart from me moaning, this is still one of the funniest and smartest shows out there.... But old folks, many feign as they were dead; Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead. O God! Romeo and Juliet - Act 2, Scene 5.",5,Hilarious!!  Larry David plays a 30 year old existential sex symbol who hates people.

It's about an old bald man that speaks his mind to everyone doesn't really filter its genius. He doesn't care about what people think of him most of all.

1128169,A1DANN3R216NBI,B0010YVC9I,"Snorre Smari Mathiesen ""Snorri Smari""","[3, 4]","Like pretty much everyone else (I assume), I originally sought out CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM due to my obsession with the Seinfeld-show, sort of an ""let's see what that other show by the Seinfeld-creator is about""-gesture. Starting at season one, it took a few episodes to get into. Among the technical aspects that set the show apart from most other sit-coms (Seinfeld included), I quickly noticed that the camera-setup in Curb evokes a kind of a home-movie feeling, and background laughter is absent, which at first makes it rather documentary-like and possibly somewhat dull by appearance to newcomers. Once one understands the rhytm of the show, however, it turns increasingly obvious that this is one of the funniest TV shows ever made, and undoubtedly the funniest and most intelligent currently in production.It could be argued that Larry David, with CURB, keeps going from the point where Seinfeld stopped. While Seinfeld certainly approached quite a few edgy topics for its time, CURB does this with a much more cynical and dark attitude. What is amazing is that the team behind the series manages to balance Larry's bitter world-view with a touch of lightfulness and, now and then, slapstick routines, which tempts the viewer into nodding and laughing recognizingly at the madness, rather than getting into the same bitter state that Larry David is in. However, one can't help but admit that his often anti-social tendencies (which in total makes for a good combination of a Woody Allen and W.C. Fields in the same person) are partly your own. Larry David, the real one as well as the CURB one, truly has a talent of observing the seemingly tiny, tiny details which, when put together, sometimes make life unbearable, and doing so in a funny way. He does in fact often have good reason for getting upset; only he does it in a way that is often viewed as not socially adequate.Other than admitting how right Larry David is, at least from a merely emotional standpoint, when uttering that thieves are preferable to neighbors (because thieves just take your things, whereas neighbors take your time); and other than eagerly waiting for your favorite supporting character to turn up (there are quite a few competitors), I'm really impressed by the story construction. With such a strong cast, it could be expected that the creators would use the opportunity of letting the stories function as mere excuses, but fact is that nearly every detail in each story, even a by-passing comment made by Larry at the beginning of an episode, plays a part to the story in the end.CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM started out as a great series, and as I'm currently watching the seventh season, I'm happy to tell that it's still going strong. If you like it at all, go for the entire series on DVD.",5,"Cynical, bitter, dark and hilarious",1276819200,"06 18, 2010",2010,2774,"['pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'else', 'assume', 'originally', 'sought', 'out', 'CURB', 'YOUR', 'ENTHUSIASM', 'due', 'obsession', 'Seinfeld-show', 'sort', 'let', 'see', 'what', 'other', 'show', 'Seinfeld-creator', '-gesture', 'Starting', 'season', 'one', 'took', 'few', 'episodes', 'get', 'technical', 'aspects', 'set', 'show', 'apart', 'most', 'other', 'sit-coms', 'Seinfeld', 'included', 'quickly', 'noticed', 'camera-setup', 'Curb', 'kind', 'home-movie', 'feeling', 'background', 'laughter', 'absent', 'first', 'rather', 'documentary-like', 'possibly', 'somewhat', 'dull', 'appearance', 'newcomers', 'Once', 'one', 'rhytm', 'show', 'however', 'increasingly', 'obvious', 'one', 'funniest', 'TV', 'shows', 'ever', 'made', 'undoubtedly', 'funniest', 'most', 'intelligent', 'currently', 'production.It', 'could', 'be', 'argued', 'Larry', 'David', 'CURB', 'going', 'point', 'where', 'Seinfeld', 'stopped', 'Seinfeld', 'certainly', 'approached', 'quite', 'few', 'edgy', 'topics', 'time', 'CURB', 'much', 'more', 'cynical', 'dark', 'attitude', 'What', 'amazing', 'team', 'series', 'balance', 'Larry', 'bitter', 'world-view', 'touch', 'lightfulness', 'now', 'then', 'slapstick', 'routines', 'viewer', 'nodding', 'laughing', 'recognizingly', 'madness', 'rather', 'getting', 'same', 'bitter', 'state', 'Larry', 'David', 'However', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'admit', 'often', 'anti-social', 'tendencies', 'total', 'good', 'combination', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'W.C.', 'Fields', 'same', 'person', 'are', 'partly', 'own', 'Larry', 'David', 'real', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'CURB', 'one', 'truly', 'talent', 'observing', 'seemingly', 'tiny', 'tiny', 'details', 'when', 'put', 'together', 'sometimes', 'make', 'life', 'unbearable', 'doing', 'so', 'funny', 'way', 'fact', 'often', 'have', 'good', 'reason', 'getting', 'upset', 'only', 'way', 'often', 'viewed', 'not', 'socially', 'adequate.Other', 'admitting', 'how', 'right', 'Larry', 'David', 'least', 'merely', 'emotional', 'standpoint', 'when', 'uttering', 'thieves', 'are', 'preferable', 'neighbors', 'just', 'take', 'things', 'whereas', 'neighbors', 'take', 'time', 'other', 'eagerly', 'waiting', 'favorite', 'supporting', 'character', 'turn', 'up', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'competitors', ""'m"", 'really', 'impressed', 'story', 'construction', 'strong', 'cast', 'could', 'be', 'expected', 'creators', 'would', 'use', 'opportunity', 'letting', 'stories', 'function', 'mere', 'excuses', 'fact', 'nearly', 'detail', 'story', 'even', 'by-passing', 'comment', 'made', 'Larry', 'beginning', 'episode', 'part', 'story', 'end.CURB', 'YOUR', 'ENTHUSIASM', 'started', 'out', 'great', 'series', ""'m"", 'currently', 'watching', 'seventh', 'season', ""'m"", 'happy', 'tell', 'still', 'going', 'strong', 'like', 'go', 'entire', 'series', 'DVD']",Curb Your Enthusiasm: The Complete Seasons 1-6
