700987,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B00006675U,Monty Moonlight,"[1, 1]","When grizzly cub Wahb's mother and sister are killed by the Colonel, a local rancher, the Colonel's Cree Indian foreman, Moki, tries to help his ""brother bear"" by taking him far out into the wilderness and away from the humans invading his land. Little Wahb still struggles, of course, growing up without his family; no one to teach him how to survive, hibernate, or anything else. He manages, however, and grows into a true king of grizzlies. That makes no difference to the Colonel though, when Wahb returns years later to unintentionally wreak havoc and frighten his men and animals. Wahb's only chance at survival again lies in the decisions made by Moki in his struggle to balance emotions and responsibilities to his heritage and to his career.In the tradition of Disney True-Life Adventures and animal stories, 1970's ""King of the Grizzlies"" is a true Disney treasure featuring legendary Disney animal-film narrator Winston Hibler (for the other Disney animal-film narration legend, Rex Allen, try ""Charlie the Lonesome Cougar""). If you grew up with these sorts of films, either in theaters or on the Disney Channel or Disney anthology series, you already know what a wholesome and relaxing delight they are, great for the whole family to watch together and full of fun, humor, education, and the majestic beauty of nature. ""King of the Grizzlies"" fits right in with the other Disney animal classics with its story of life as a grizzly and the good and bad that can come from man's interaction with the animal kingdom.Warning: King of the Grizzlies does depict animal death by shooting. Early on, the Colonel shoots at Wahb and his family from a distance, leaving him alone in the world, as I mentioned, and in the middle of the story, three wolves are shot and killed off camera (I did take issue with Moki's complete lack of feeling when killing wolves, my own favorite animal, in contrast to his stress over the killing of bears; then again, his kinship with bears is nicely explained through a Cree creation myth). I mention this because I know personally some folks who just can't watch anything involving animals being hurt/killed, though keep in mind that there is no gore and it is all to reflect the realism of ranching life of the time and necessary to the story too. ""King of Grizzlies"" is still a wonderful, beautiful film about the man vs. animal territory struggle and learning to live together with mutual respect.Though I still recommend it, the DVD from Disney is, unfortunately, totally bare bones. It has a fullscreen presentation, but I do not know for sure what the proper aspect ratio is, and some Disney films are correctly presented in fullscreen. There IS a bonus to be had if you buy this DVD from the right source while Disney's ""Earth"" is still in theaters. Currently, some retailers carrying ""King of the Grizzlies"" offer it with a special sticker on the cover that holds a code for free movie cash (up to 8 dollars for use on a child's ticket; some more expensive Disney DVDs hold the up-to-12 dollars adult ticket movie cash code). However, if I was buying this with the movie cash in mind, I'd buy it in person to make sure the sticker was there. It all depends on where you get it, but this offer won't be good for much longer anyway. I recommend picking up ""King of the Grizzlies"" on its own merits, because it's just a great film.",5,Oldschool Disney Animal Adventure!,1240876800,"04 28, 2009",2009,3372,"['When', 'grizzly', 'cub', 'Wahb', 'mother', 'sister', 'are', 'killed', 'Colonel', 'local', 'rancher', 'Colonel', 'Cree', 'Indian', 'foreman', 'Moki', 'help', 'bear', 'taking', 'far', 'out', 'wilderness', 'away', 'humans', 'invading', 'land', 'Little', 'Wahb', 'still', 'course', 'growing', 'up', 'family', 'one', 'teach', 'how', 'survive', 'hibernate', 'anything', 'else', 'however', 'true', 'king', 'grizzlies', 'difference', 'Colonel', 'when', 'Wahb', 'years', 'later', 'unintentionally', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'frighten', 'men', 'animals', 'Wahb', 'only', 'chance', 'survival', 'again', 'decisions', 'made', 'Moki', 'struggle', 'balance', 'emotions', 'responsibilities', 'heritage', 'career.In', 'tradition', 'Disney', 'True-Life', 'Adventures', 'animal', 'stories', '1970', 'King', 'Grizzlies', 'true', 'Disney', 'treasure', 'featuring', 'legendary', 'Disney', 'animal-film', 'narrator', 'Winston', 'Hibler', 'other', 'Disney', 'animal-film', 'narration', 'legend', 'Rex', 'Allen', 'try', 'Charlie', 'Lonesome', 'Cougar', 'grew', 'up', 'sorts', 'films', 'either', 'theaters', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'Disney', 'anthology', 'series', 'already', 'know', 'what', 'wholesome', 'relaxing', 'delight', 'are', 'great', 'whole', 'family', 'watch', 'together', 'full', 'fun', 'humor', 'education', 'majestic', 'beauty', 'nature', 'King', 'Grizzlies', 'fits', 'right', 'other', 'Disney', 'animal', 'classics', 'story', 'life', 'grizzly', 'good', 'bad', 'can', 'come', 'man', 'interaction', 'animal', 'kingdom.Warning', 'King', 'Grizzlies', 'depict', 'animal', 'death', 'shooting', 'Early', 'Colonel', 'shoots', 'Wahb', 'family', 'distance', 'leaving', 'alone', 'world', 'mentioned', 'middle', 'story', 'three', 'wolves', 'are', 'shot', 'killed', 'off', 'camera', 'did', 'take', 'issue', 'Moki', 'complete', 'lack', 'feeling', 'when', 'killing', 'wolves', 'own', 'favorite', 'animal', 'contrast', 'stress', 'killing', 'bears', 'then', 'again', 'kinship', 'bears', 'nicely', 'explained', 'Cree', 'creation', 'myth', 'mention', 'know', 'personally', 'folks', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'anything', 'involving', 'animals', 'being', 'hurt/killed', 'keep', 'mind', 'gore', 'reflect', 'realism', 'ranching', 'life', 'time', 'necessary', 'story', 'too', 'King', 'Grizzlies', 'still', 'wonderful', 'beautiful', 'film', 'man', 'vs.', 'animal', 'territory', 'struggle', 'learning', 'live', 'together', 'mutual', 'respect.Though', 'still', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'Disney', 'unfortunately', 'totally', 'bare', 'bones', 'fullscreen', 'presentation', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'sure', 'what', 'proper', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'Disney', 'films', 'are', 'correctly', 'presented', 'fullscreen', 'bonus', 'be', 'had', 'buy', 'DVD', 'right', 'source', 'Disney', 'Earth', 'still', 'theaters', 'Currently', 'retailers', 'carrying', 'King', 'Grizzlies', 'offer', 'special', 'sticker', 'cover', 'code', 'free', 'movie', 'cash', '8', 'dollars', 'use', 'child', 'ticket', 'more', 'expensive', 'Disney', 'DVDs', 'hold', 'up-to-12', 'dollars', 'adult', 'ticket', 'movie', 'cash', 'code', 'However', 'was', 'buying', 'movie', 'cash', 'mind', ""'d"", 'buy', 'person', 'make', 'sure', 'sticker', 'was', 'there', 'where', 'get', 'offer', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'good', 'much', 'longer', 'anyway', 'recommend', 'picking', 'up', 'King', 'Grizzlies', 'own', 'merits', 'just', 'great', 'film']",King Of The Grizzlies

Wilson ""Author: Animal Movies Guide ...","[12, 12]","Taking place at the tail end of the Old West era, King of the Grizzlies documents the story of Moh-Sum-See Wahb, a grizzly bear with an odd track-mark. He lives an idyllic life with his mother and his twin sister. He hunts, plays, meets a marmot and a badger, and even does some snow sledding on a vessel made of bark. As the events unfold, a narrator (Winston Hibler) tells us what we're seeing and what Wahb is presumably thinking and feeling. Eventually man comes into the picture, bringing with him a whole lot of trouble. The movie is slowly-paced and might bore the tykes, but the scenery and wildlife is breathtaking.

It is a Disney adaptation of Ernest Thompson Seton's ""Biography of a Grizzly.""  ""King of the Grizzlies"" is Disney fare, which means that it is definitely family-friendly AND possessed of excellent photography and cinematography.The story itself loosely follows the plot of the original story but does not distort it.  The original ""Meteetsee Wahb"" was an 1100-pound cattle killer that was not nearly as cuddly as this bear is, but the cinematic Wahb is very handsome, well-trained, and does evoke a certain sympathy for the species.  Most Disney films featuring live-action animal performers were designed to evoke viewers' support for animals, and this one is no exception.  To its credit, the film also does not represent an attempt to malign the reputation of early Western hunters or ranchers.Great family fare to watch with your kids on a weeknight or a weekend afternoon.",5,Wahb In All of his Technicolor Glory!,1373846400,"07 15, 2013",2013,951,"['first', 'saw', 'film', 'theater', 'parents', 'early', ""'70"", 'Disney', 'adaptation', 'Ernest', 'Thompson', 'Seton', 'Biography', 'Grizzly', 'King', 'Grizzlies', 'Disney', 'fare', 'definitely', 'family-friendly', 'AND', 'possessed', 'excellent', 'photography', 'cinematography.The', 'story', 'loosely', 'plot', 'original', 'story', 'not', 'distort', 'original', 'Meteetsee', 'Wahb', 'was', '1100-pound', 'cattle', 'killer', 'was', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'cuddly', 'bear', 'cinematic', 'Wahb', 'very', 'handsome', 'well-trained', 'evoke', 'certain', 'sympathy', 'species', 'Most', 'Disney', 'films', 'featuring', 'live-action', 'animal', 'performers', 'were', 'designed', 'evoke', 'viewers', 'support', 'animals', 'one', 'exception', 'credit', 'film', 'also', 'not', 'represent', 'attempt', 'malign', 'reputation', 'early', 'Western', 'hunters', 'ranchers.Great', 'family', 'fare', 'watch', 'kids', 'weeknight', 'weekend', 'afternoon']",King Of The Grizzlies
