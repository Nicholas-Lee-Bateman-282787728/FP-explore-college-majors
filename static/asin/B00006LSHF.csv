Lorenz,"[0, 1]","David Cassidy, the larger-than-life 1970's deity, gives a masterful,rockin' performance; what I'd call the ultimate performance of his career. A must for any Cassidy fan!His performance is just as good, if not better, than it ever was, originally in the 1970's.He performs hits from &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; such as &quot; I Think I Love You&quot;, &quot;I Can Feel Your Heartbeat&quot;, &quot;Could It Be Forever&quot;, and &quot;I Woke Up In Love This Morning&quot;As well as song from his solo career such as &quot;I write the songs&quot;, &quot;Cherish&quot;, &quot;Lyin' To Myself&quot;This is David at his best!!",5,David Cassidy's Opus,1044057600,"02 1, 2003",2003,626,"['David', 'Cassidy', 'larger-than-life', '1970', 'deity', 'masterful', 'rockin', 'performance', 'what', ""'d"", 'call', 'ultimate', 'performance', 'career', 'must', 'Cassidy', 'fan', 'performance', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'ever', 'was', 'originally', ""1970's.He"", 'performs', 'hits', 'quot', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'quot', 'such', 'Think', 'Love', 'quot', 'quot', 'Can', 'Feel', 'Your', 'Heartbeat', 'quot', 'quot', 'Could', 'Be', 'Forever', 'quot', 'quot', 'Woke', 'Up', 'Love', 'Morning', 'quot', 'As', 'well', 'song', 'solo', 'career', 'such', 'write', 'songs', 'quot', 'quot', 'Cherish', 'quot', 'quot', 'Lyin', 'Myself', 'quot', 'David', 'best']",N/A
721167,A36VA0K8NVUXQD,B00006LSHF,D. C. Sterling,"[3, 5]","This DVD was truly horrible to watch. I am a big David Cassidy fan--I grew up watching him on the Partridge Family and loved (past tense!) his voice then. I was disappointed on so many levels with this DVD that I had to write a review to offset all those 5 star reviews (what were they thinking??) for this DVD.His voice: shows no range of high to low notes on this DVD. It's pretty much monotone and husky. He shows no range of emotion when he sings the songs, so they come across as fake and meaningless.His stage presence: comes across as a really bad wedding singer from the eighties. He has a huge fake smile glued to his face for 90% of the show, even during serious songs. He tries to act sexy in a big, fake, obvious way that is very painful to watch. He continuously plays to the audience of women and acts like he's still a sexy teen idol when he's not! He's a middle-aged man and should show some dignity and maturity and it's just not there, which is so sad.His hair: looks fake, too. It's been combed off his face and must have so much hair spray in it that it couldn't possibly move anywhere. It's like a rock glued to the top of his head.This DVD could have been awesome if David had acted his age, showing maturity and dignity, singing the serious songs in a serious manner, and showing the range of emotions and notes his voice used to be capable of.Is David really this vain? Is his voice gone? Or does he still have it? You certainly can't tell from this awful, self-serving DVD. I hope he still does have the wonderful voice he had in his youth and that he records another album that will show us he still has it.This DVD I bought will be donated to charity.",1,Horrible DVD--don't waste your money!,1243123200,"05 24, 2009",2009,1678,"['DVD', 'was', 'truly', 'horrible', 'watch', 'am', 'big', 'David', 'Cassidy', 'fan', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'loved', 'past', 'tense', 'voice', 'then', 'was', 'disappointed', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'DVD', 'had', 'write', 'review', 'offset', '5', 'star', 'reviews', 'were', 'thinking', 'DVD.His', 'voice', 'range', 'high', 'low', 'notes', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'much', 'monotone', 'husky', 'range', 'emotion', 'when', 'songs', 'come', 'fake', 'meaningless.His', 'stage', 'presence', 'really', 'bad', 'wedding', 'singer', 'eighties', 'huge', 'fake', 'smile', 'glued', 'face', '90', '%', 'show', 'even', 'serious', 'songs', 'act', 'sexy', 'big', 'fake', 'obvious', 'way', 'very', 'painful', 'watch', 'continuously', 'audience', 'women', 'acts', 'still', 'sexy', 'teen', 'idol', 'when', 'not', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'should', 'show', 'dignity', 'maturity', 'just', 'not', 'there', 'so', 'sad.His', 'hair', 'looks', 'fake', 'too', 'been', 'combed', 'face', 'must', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'hair', 'spray', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'move', 'anywhere', 'rock', 'glued', 'top', 'head.This', 'DVD', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'awesome', 'David', 'had', 'acted', 'age', 'showing', 'maturity', 'dignity', 'singing', 'serious', 'songs', 'serious', 'manner', 'showing', 'range', 'emotions', 'notes', 'voice', 'used', 'be', 'capable', 'of.Is', 'David', 'really', 'vain', 'voice', 'gone', 'still', 'have', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'awful', 'self-serving', 'DVD', 'hope', 'still', 'have', 'wonderful', 'voice', 'had', 'youth', 'album', 'will', 'show', 'still', 'it.This', 'DVD', 'bought', 'will', 'be', 'donated', 'charity']",N/A

721170,A211VSXEOIPJQF,B00006LSHF,"Lyn ""musicolit""","[10, 16]","I was quite disappointed in this. I bought it on the basis of customer reviews but it didn't do it for me.Look David's voice has improved in many ways since his Partridge Family Days and the talent is there but I wish he'd rethink his approach.If you like the Vegas show style of perpetual plastered smile on face and all numbers of an upbeat sort of style perhaps this is for you. I'm more into the rock angle and like more bite, emotion and grit and a feeling someone is laying bare their soul and emotion.I like variation in mood. If you are going to sing about heartache or sadness I like that mood to be embodied and expressed by the singer. However David has that beaming determined smile when he sings of being left and crying etc. Is he really that happy and joyful because there is almost a mask-like quality to it that looks trained for stage?The odd thing is that I remember the original TV show when he used to have quite a haunting sad and reflective look when he did express that sort of variation in mood. So he seems to have left his acting behind in favour of broadway show resolute cheeriness.The other problem is superficial and trivial but it completely distracted me - his hair! He is a little receding now (no big deal) but he wears it in a tight off-the-face rocker style which has been coiffed to add a little more height so it looks even more severe. It is VERY severe and a marked contrast to the soft and sexy look he used to have with more hair tumbling over his forehead - gee, I'm still a child of the 60s and I do like soft, sexy, slightly longer hair rather than military precision!The songs? - Really uneven for me - a couple I had to skip tracks. 'Cherish' I found quite painful for instance. However 'Aint no sunshine' was shaping well - except for his cheerfulness about the lack of sunshine with his girl gone! 'Hush' had potential that slowing down a bit and putting some real emotion and depth into it would have brought to completion.So if you think I'm being picky when the guy to you just looks happy all the time, and you are into a Vegas-show style, don't care if all emotions are expressed one-dimensionally, you like a more severe haircut- or you are a fan no matter what - go for it.As a casual explorer it wasnt for me and it's a pity because from what I heard from his voice he's got the talent, with a different haircut he's still got the looks, and from what I recall of his acting he could really sink into those songs and really connect to the heart if he went for singing the meaning of the songs he chooses.Time for an upgrade and to rethink David- unless your dedicated fans like the more bubble gum style.",2,Disappointing unless you are a fan,1109548800,"02 28, 2005",2005,2662,"['was', 'quite', 'disappointed', 'bought', 'basis', 'customer', 'reviews', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'me.Look', 'David', 'voice', 'improved', 'many', 'ways', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'Days', 'talent', 'there', 'wish', ""'d"", 'rethink', 'approach.If', 'Vegas', 'show', 'style', 'perpetual', 'plastered', 'smile', 'face', 'numbers', 'upbeat', 'sort', 'style', 'perhaps', ""'m"", 'more', 'rock', 'angle', 'more', 'bite', 'emotion', 'grit', 'feeling', 'someone', 'laying', 'bare', 'soul', 'emotion.I', 'variation', 'mood', 'are', 'going', 'sing', 'heartache', 'sadness', 'like', 'mood', 'be', 'embodied', 'expressed', 'singer', 'However', 'David', 'beaming', 'determined', 'smile', 'when', 'being', 'left', 'crying', 'etc', 'really', 'happy', 'joyful', 'almost', 'mask-like', 'quality', 'trained', 'stage', 'odd', 'thing', 'remember', 'original', 'TV', 'show', 'when', 'used', 'have', 'quite', 'haunting', 'sad', 'reflective', 'look', 'when', 'did', 'express', 'sort', 'variation', 'mood', 'So', 'have', 'left', 'acting', 'favour', 'broadway', 'show', 'resolute', 'cheeriness.The', 'other', 'problem', 'superficial', 'trivial', 'completely', 'distracted', 'hair', 'little', 'receding', 'now', 'big', 'deal', 'tight', 'off-the-face', 'rocker', 'style', 'been', 'coiffed', 'add', 'little', 'more', 'height', 'even', 'more', 'severe', 'VERY', 'severe', 'marked', 'contrast', 'soft', 'sexy', 'look', 'used', 'have', 'more', 'hair', 'tumbling', 'forehead', 'gee', ""'m"", 'still', 'child', '60s', 'do', 'soft', 'sexy', 'slightly', 'longer', 'hair', 'rather', 'military', 'precision', 'songs', 'Really', 'uneven', 'couple', 'had', 'skip', 'tracks', ""'Cherish"", 'found', 'quite', 'painful', 'instance', 'However', ""'Aint"", 'sunshine', 'was', 'shaping', 'well', 'cheerfulness', 'lack', 'sunshine', 'girl', 'gone', ""'Hush"", 'had', 'potential', 'slowing', 'down', 'bit', 'putting', 'real', 'emotion', 'depth', 'would', 'have', 'brought', 'completion.So', 'think', ""'m"", 'being', 'picky', 'when', 'guy', 'just', 'happy', 'time', 'are', 'Vegas-show', 'style', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'emotions', 'are', 'expressed', 'one-dimensionally', 'like', 'more', 'severe', 'haircut-', 'are', 'fan', 'matter', 'what', 'go', 'it.As', 'casual', 'explorer', 'pity', 'what', 'heard', 'voice', 'got', 'talent', 'different', 'haircut', 'still', 'got', 'looks', 'what', 'recall', 'acting', 'could', 'really', 'sink', 'songs', 'really', 'connect', 'heart', 'went', 'singing', 'meaning', 'songs', 'upgrade', 'rethink', 'David-', 'dedicated', 'fans', 'more', 'bubble', 'gum', 'style']",N/A
