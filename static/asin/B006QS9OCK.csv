1519078,ACT23DA95IX31,B006QS9OCK,Book-Movie-Music Lover,"[3, 3]","First, I commend those who were involved in making and acting in this movie for not coming to this Amazon site and writing their own glowing ""reviews"" of their own movie (as so often happens with independent movies). The fact that they waited for objective viewers to write the reviews shows a lot of integrity.I found this to be an incredibly (as I said in the title) ""realistic, honest and riveting"" movie. I really wasn't expecting much at all when I started watching it. I figured just another ho-hum independent movie. It was much more.The main actor and actress, Sam Rosen and Zoe Lister-Jones, were absolutely phenomenal. They WERE their characters. I never felt as though they were acting. In addition, the scenes and the shots were incredibly realistic. For these reasons, during the whole movie, I felt as though I was actually in the movie - with the characters. I was participating in their adventure. I virtually never experience that when watching a film, and it was a very refreshing experience.The movie also made intriguing use of split screen - not often, but just enough to make it appropriate.I think the young director, Brady Kiernan, has a bright future ahead of him if he can stay true to the integrity and creativity that he brought to this movie.In sum, DEFINITELY worth watching if you are a fan of unique, independent movies.",5,"Realistic, Honest and Riveting",1331596800,"03 13, 2012",2012,1352,"['First', 'commend', 'who', 'were', 'involved', 'making', 'acting', 'movie', 'not', 'coming', 'Amazon', 'site', 'writing', 'own', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'own', 'movie', 'so', 'often', 'independent', 'movies', 'fact', 'waited', 'objective', 'viewers', 'write', 'reviews', 'lot', 'integrity.I', 'found', 'be', 'incredibly', 'said', 'title', 'realistic', 'honest', 'riveting', 'movie', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'when', 'started', 'watching', 'figured', 'just', 'ho-hum', 'independent', 'movie', 'was', 'much', 'more.The', 'main', 'actor', 'actress', 'Sam', 'Rosen', 'Zoe', 'Lister-Jones', 'were', 'absolutely', 'phenomenal', 'WERE', 'characters', 'never', 'felt', 'were', 'acting', 'addition', 'scenes', 'shots', 'were', 'incredibly', 'realistic', 'reasons', 'whole', 'movie', 'felt', 'was', 'actually', 'movie', 'characters', 'was', 'participating', 'adventure', 'virtually', 'never', 'experience', 'when', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'refreshing', 'experience.The', 'movie', 'also', 'made', 'intriguing', 'use', 'split', 'screen', 'not', 'often', 'just', 'enough', 'make', 'appropriate.I', 'think', 'young', 'director', 'Brady', 'Kiernan', 'bright', 'future', 'ahead', 'can', 'stay', 'true', 'integrity', 'creativity', 'brought', 'movie.In', 'sum', 'DEFINITELY', 'watching', 'are', 'fan', 'unique', 'independent', 'movies']",Stuck Between Stations

1519080,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B006QS9OCK,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","This is not a new idea in movies. Two people connect in the early evening and their mini odyssey runs on through to dawn and the two find out things about each other and themselves in the interim.Here's the scoop. It's Casper's (Sam Rosen) last night in town before he heads back to the base and back to Afghanistan. He runs into Rebecca (Zoe Lister Jones) at a bar. They remember each other from grade school and proceed to strike up a conversation which leads to this that and the other thing. As dawn approaches the two have come to some conclusions about themselves and each other.I liked this movie because I liked the two main characters. They have good hearts but they're flawed. He has some father issues and feels a bit guilty because the war hasn't screwed him up as it has many of those he served with. She's bright and on her way to a masters degree (PHD?) but pulled a big boner that might derail that. He's had a thing for her since grades school. She remembers him but doesn't share the same &#34;thing&#34; he has for her. hey have a string of good conversations as their inner selves come to the surface.There is some nice use of split screen. It's more subtle than I've seen in other movies. I also liked the music score. It has a dreamy, ethereal quality to it. I probably couldn't listen to it by itself but it works well here.It was shot well. Not at all flashy but of a level as to eliminate the sense I was watching actors on a set. Josh Hartnett and Michael Imperioli hold their own in small roles.The conversations between Casper and Rebecca might be a bit too clever and &#34;now.&#34; It will be interesting to see how well this views ten years from now, but I liked it. They were both insightful. But the performances of both were good.This is Brady Kiernan's first outing as director. I hope to see him at the helm again. He's done a nice job here. If good indy films are your poison, you could do much worse.

Casper (Rosen) is a soldier home for a few days when he meets high school classmate Becky (Jones) at a bar. After getting in a fight Casper and Becky begin talking and wind up walking and talking for the rest of the night, revealing deep secrets to each other throughout the night.  This review may sound confusing. I was trying very hard to like this movie for some reason. To me this movie alternated from really good to really boring over and over. The movie is pretty much just the two walking and talking for an hour and a half but it is still a decent movie that if you are in the mood for is worth a watch. The ending is very good and is worth making it all the way through for that. Overall, a movie with real high and lows that is worth watching. When you are in the mood for it.
