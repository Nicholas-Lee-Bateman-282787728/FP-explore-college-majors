Can a rent boy give up his habbits and create a healthy relationship?After I have seen the film, I know the answer is ""no"".The end of love can have here several meanings. It's the love between mother and child (Ming and his mother), love between two lovers (Ming and Yan) or the love between two ""brothers"" (Ming and Keung).The message is obvious - love is the loser in the game of life. It was the first thought I had after I had finished watching the film.It's not one of those happy, light gay-theme movies. It's rather sad, depressing.Fair good, although its composition (retrospection scenes here and there) makes it difficult to follow at times.",3,No happy ending,1311897600,"07 29, 2011",2011,736,"['Can', 'one', 'give', 'up', 'drugs', 'owe', 'prayers', 'Can', 'one', 'stop', 'drinking', 'owe', 'own', 'faith', 'God', 'Can', 'rent', 'boy', 'give', 'up', 'habbits', 'create', 'healthy', 'relationship', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'know', 'answer', '.The', 'end', 'love', 'can', 'have', 'here', 'several', 'meanings', 'love', 'mother', 'child', 'Ming', 'mother', 'love', 'two', 'lovers', 'Ming', 'Yan', 'love', 'two', 'brothers', 'Ming', 'Keung', '.The', 'message', 'obvious', 'love', 'loser', 'game', 'life', 'was', 'first', 'thought', 'had', 'had', 'finished', 'watching', 'film.It', 'not', 'one', 'happy', 'light', 'gay-theme', 'movies', 'rather', 'sad', 'depressing.Fair', 'good', 'composition', 'retrospection', 'scenes', 'here', 'there', 'difficult', 'follow', 'times']",N/A

1288403,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B002TJPAV4,Tommy Dooley,"[1, 1]","This is a belter of a film from Hong Kong. It is billed as a hedonistic rent boy, bites off more than he can chew in the drug department, overdoses, and his sordid life as a prostitute gets revealed to his loving boyfriend who just can't handle it. He ends up in rehab but will he be able to stay on the straight and narrow when he gets released? So is that really what its about? Yes well sort of.Ming (Chi-Kin Lee) was working in a shop where he meets boyfriend Yan (Ben Yeung) and they become a couple. But we pick up the story with Ming at the Christian run re-hab centre, where he has been sentenced to serve time after he got caught in a drugs bust. Through the use of flashback the story is gradually told and it is far from black and white. We get to find out why Ming chucked in his job to become a rent boy and as a result of that why his drug taking became excessive.He makes a friend Chueng at the centre and the story really takes of after when they are released.This is not a story for the faint hearted or easily offended, there are numerous depictions of gay sex (and it is not all homo erotic either) some graphic scenes of drug use and painful depiction of group therapy, including praying in tongues. That said Ming is as hot as Satan's microwave and seems to have real on screen chemistry with Yan. The story unfolds slowly but you don't really get that until the final piece is put in the jig saw.At 97 minutes writer and director Simon Chung has made a praise worthy film. It will not be to everyone's taste especially the depictions of non consensual sex. I actually had a `no' moment in this, that is where you involuntarily shout out `No' at the screen in a childish attempt to influence the on screen antics. That is normally only reserved for horror films, so I was actually impressed. If you love world cinema in all its guises then you will want to see this.",4,`God Only Tells us things we don't want to hear',1330992000,"03 6, 2012",2012,1887,"['belter', 'film', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'billed', 'hedonistic', 'rent', 'boy', 'more', 'can', 'chew', 'drug', 'department', 'overdoses', 'sordid', 'life', 'prostitute', 'revealed', 'loving', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'up', 'rehab', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'stay', 'straight', 'narrow', 'when', 'released', 'So', 'really', 'what', 'Yes', 'well', 'sort', 'of.Ming', 'Chi-Kin', 'Lee', 'was', 'working', 'shop', 'where', 'boyfriend', 'Yan', 'Ben', 'Yeung', 'become', 'couple', 'pick', 'up', 'story', 'Ming', 'Christian', 'run', 're-hab', 'centre', 'where', 'been', 'sentenced', 'serve', 'time', 'got', 'caught', 'drugs', 'bust', 'use', 'flashback', 'story', 'gradually', 'told', 'far', 'black', 'white', 'get', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'Ming', 'chucked', 'job', 'become', 'rent', 'boy', 'result', 'why', 'drug', 'taking', 'became', 'excessive.He', 'friend', 'Chueng', 'centre', 'story', 'really', 'when', 'are', 'released.This', 'not', 'story', 'faint', 'hearted', 'easily', 'offended', 'are', 'numerous', 'depictions', 'gay', 'sex', 'not', 'homo', 'erotic', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'drug', 'use', 'painful', 'depiction', 'group', 'therapy', 'including', 'praying', 'tongues', 'said', 'Ming', 'as', 'hot', 'Satan', 'microwave', 'have', 'real', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'Yan', 'story', 'unfolds', 'slowly', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'final', 'piece', 'put', 'jig', 'saw.At', '97', 'minutes', 'writer', 'director', 'Simon', 'Chung', 'made', 'praise', 'worthy', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'taste', 'especially', 'depictions', 'non', 'consensual', 'sex', 'actually', 'had', 'moment', 'where', 'involuntarily', 'shout', 'out', 'No', 'screen', 'childish', 'attempt', 'influence', 'screen', 'antics', 'normally', 'only', 'reserved', 'horror', 'films', 'was', 'actually', 'impressed', 'love', 'world', 'cinema', 'guises', 'then', 'will', 'want', 'see']",N/A
