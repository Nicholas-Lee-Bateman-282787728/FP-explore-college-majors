1545492,A3RCQIB2XOXLXB,B0083SF0FG,Anthony Gale,"[2, 3]",This is my most prized possession. The price is a steal. Buying each season individually and only on a regular dvd is more expensive than this box set. The bluray versions offer many special features that are hours of fun and filled with essential information for every fan. I highly recommend this product.,5,GREAT!!!!!

My wife and I did not get the chance to watch when it was on regular viewing, but I did not find one bad review.  This is really a great series and we loved show's that were paranormal in nature with theme's that were based in the Supernatural.  You have to give yourself a show or two so you can adjust to the characters and the pace of the writing.  The show has a rhythm and it is really easy to sit back and let the show take it's course.  The blu-ray is nicely done and we really liked the vintage rock theme, along with the 67 or 68 Chevy they use in the transportation portion.  I would recommend this purchase from the science fiction category as well as most entertainment for the dollar.  It truly is a winner.",5,If you loved the X-Files....,1391817600,"02 8, 2014",2014,818,"['bottom', 'line', 'series', 'really', 'loved', 'x-files', 'well', 'know', 'rest', 'My', 'wife', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'chance', 'watch', 'when', 'was', 'regular', 'viewing', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'one', 'bad', 'review', 'really', 'great', 'series', 'loved', 'show', 'were', 'paranormal', 'nature', 'theme', 'were', 'based', 'Supernatural', 'have', 'give', 'show', 'two', 'can', 'adjust', 'characters', 'pace', 'writing', 'show', 'rhythm', 'really', 'easy', 'sit', 'back', 'let', 'show', 'take', 'course', 'blu-ray', 'nicely', 'done', 'really', 'liked', 'vintage', 'rock', 'theme', '67', '68', 'Chevy', 'use', 'transportation', 'portion', 'would', 'recommend', 'purchase', 'science', 'fiction', 'category', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'entertainment', 'dollar', 'truly', 'winner']",Supernatural: Season 1-8

It also has many extras that are really entertaining.  Some were worried about it working on USA blu-ray players, but it works great on my Sony player.  I can't wait until Season 9 comes out on Blu-ray.  This is also a nice souvenier box and the DVD's are in sturdy containers.  A lot of quality for a bargain price.",5,Terrific DVD's - work great on my Sony BluRay Player,1402531200,"06 12, 2014",2014,451,"['So', 'thrilled', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'are', 'quality', 'viewing', 'easy', 'scroll', 'menus', 'select', 'episode', 'also', 'many', 'extras', 'are', 'really', 'entertaining', 'were', 'worried', 'working', 'USA', 'blu-ray', 'players', 'great', 'Sony', 'player', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Season', '9', 'out', 'Blu-ray', 'also', 'nice', 'souvenier', 'box', 'DVD', 'are', 'sturdy', 'containers', 'lot', 'quality', 'bargain', 'price']",Supernatural: Season 1-8
1545496,A3EBMERWAK5C05,B0083SF0FG,gh2user,"[1, 1]","I was hooked from the first episode.  The creatures, myths and urban legends they face are all awesome.  The chemistry of both Dean and Sam, is always going back and forth.  A few funny stand alone episodes are scattered throughout.  If you like ghosts, goblins, and things that go bump in the night, then I recommend this show.This product is from Ireland, but will play on U.S. blu-ray players.  In fact, I watch them on my PS3, with no problem.  The price is great at less than $95.00 (as of 6/19/2014).  If you buy all eight seasons individually, then you will pay, as of 6/19/2014 - $269.82.  Buying this will save you over $170.

1545498,A3Q853FNKG0AV,B0083SF0FG,Jennifer,"[1, 2]","Awesome show!  This is one of my favorite scifi shows on television!  The first five seasons were excellent!  The storylines lagged in seasons 6 and 7 which culminated in the destruction of one of the worst big baddies in the series, the leviathan.  Season 8 redeems it all with the return of classic writers and storylines.  This is a great collection for Supernatural fans with fantatstic HD resolution and lots of extras.",5,Must buy for any Supernatural fan!,1386201600,"12 5, 2013",2013,424,"['Awesome', 'show', 'one', 'favorite', 'scifi', 'shows', 'television', 'first', 'five', 'seasons', 'were', 'excellent', 'storylines', 'lagged', 'seasons', '6', '7', 'culminated', 'destruction', 'one', 'worst', 'big', 'baddies', 'series', 'leviathan', 'Season', '8', 'return', 'classic', 'writers', 'storylines', 'great', 'collection', 'Supernatural', 'fans', 'fantatstic', 'HD', 'resolution', 'lots', 'extras']",Supernatural: Season 1-8
