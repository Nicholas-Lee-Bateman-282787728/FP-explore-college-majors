Loren proves she's more than a sexy woman, she won an Oscar for best actress for this movie. The transfer is my only gripe, the tracking is horrible. The subtitles and story are easy to understand.

389927,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,6303934315,Alex Udvary,"[8, 9]","All of the truly great movies deal with people we care about. They're about people we want to spend 90 mins or two hours with. We feel as if we know these people by the time the film ends. Think of &quot;The Godfather&quot;, &quot;Wild Strawberries&quot;, &quot;A Street Car Named Desire&quot;, or &quot;A Rebel Without A Cause&quot;. We feel these characters struggles, and go along with them. Vittorio De Sica's &quot;Two Women&quot; follows in this tradition. Like De Sica's other film &quot;The Bicycle Thief&quot;, the characters in this movie seem real. There's a deep understanding between the viewer and the characters. The characters in this movie have simplistic needs that we all can understand. I'm kinda shocked to actually come across all these 1 and 2 star reviews. When I first saw this film, I was really taken with it. The movie which is based on a novel by Alberto Moravia and was written by De Sica and Cesare Zavattini is as I put in my title, simply a masterpiece. Sophia Loren stars as Cesira, a lonely mother of a teenage daughter,Rosetta (Eloenora). With a war going on, Cesira (Loren) decides that her daughter and herself should leave Rome, and head to a place they feel they will be more safe. After their store gets bombed. Now, for those who don't know what the movie is about I'll tell you. It's about the brutal rape of a mother and daughter. Now, if you've seen this movie, you see how De Sica is almost teasing us. He sets up so many situations where we feel, oh! OK, now this is where it's going to happen. We see men stare at Loren. They're never seen anything so beautiful before. You could see the pure lust in their eyes. De Sica is trying to &quot;trick&quot; us. He's keeping up our suspense. So that when it finally does happen, we've been watching the characters so long, and have come to care about them, that we find the event to be truly tragic. Before I saw this film, I thought the rape would happen early on in the movie, and the rest of the film is about them dealing with it. As you can tell, De Sica is a heck of a lot smarter than me. He makes us develop a relationship with the characters first. Because think about it. If it happened in the beginning of the movie, would you really care? I mean, yes, probably you would, but it wouldn't be so much because of the characters. It's because your seeing a terrible act being committed. Besides the heartfelt ating by Loren and Brown (Rosetta) there's wonderful music by Armando Trovajoli. And very good cinematography by Gabor Pogany. From what I've seen by De Sica, this is probably his second best film (Behind &quot;The Bicycle Thief, which is my favorite movie of all time). This is a truly outstanding piece of work. And, as many know this is the first movie where a Foreign actor(male or female) won an Oscar for acting. A must for all film lovers!p.s.- As mentioned by other reviewers this movie really needs to be restored. The movie is in terrible condition.

Sophia Loren plays a beautiful widow who seeks to protect her teenage daughter from the ravages of World War II Rome.  She's proud, opinionated, but protective and loving toward her daughter Rosetta.  The two women flee to the widow's village, where they meet an idealistic young man to whom they are both attracted.  The tragic events occur quite late in the film, but by the time they do, we really know who these characters are, making the film extremely powerful.Loren looks stunning and acts wonderfully, but all the actors in the film are wonderful as well.  But Loren had (and still has) that quality that makes her the center of all attention every time she is on-screen.  A stunning actress in a stunning role.I cannot finish this review without commenting on the abysmal video transfer to DVD.  This is without a doubt the worst looking and sounding DVD I have ever seen since the medium was invented.  I wish Sophia Loren would sue this video company for the travesty they have done to this fine film.

Loren is feisty and earthy; when she meets an intellectual and idealist (Jean-Paul Belmondo) who falls madly in love with her, she doesn't understand him and rejects his loftiness. The rape scene, especially of Brown, whom Lauren has protected all her life, is brutal, and it unhinges Brown temporarily: her body and soul just shut down - until they learn of the death of Belmondo, whom Brown had loved more than Loren did. De Sica directs brilliantly: every frame has purpose to it, nothing is wasted.The print used to make this DVD is a piece of garbage, and why that's so is hard to understand.

When TWO WOMEN was released, the film magazines depicted her as having experienced the horrors of war first hand as a young Italian girl during WWII. Like Audrey Hepburn, she was purported to have been saved from starvation by the advancing Allies.TWO WOMEN was released about 15 years after WWII. The film storyline follows the day-to-day struggles of a young mother and her teenage daughter who are refugees fleeing the violence of the war brought to their Italian village during WWII. Fleeing to a place of safety, the two endure many hardships.The film does not include gratuitous violence, but it does not pull any punches either. Many of the scenes are horrifying, or at least they were to me in the 1960s. In one scene women are raped by a gang of deserters from the Italian army. I was very young when I saw this film, but I cannot recall a more horrific scene even though the actual act of rape is not shown. In another scene, women who have betrayed their fellow villagers are punished in a way that I still find shocking--although very Italian (the Nazis would have shot them!!).Unfortunatley, the horrors shown in this film have always been and apparently always will be commonplace wherever men are fighting.

From the beginning when we see bombings destroying homes in Rome all the way to the end of the film constantly shows us the destructiveness of war. The main character, Cesira, abandons Rome taking her daughter Rosetta with her and goes to the village where Rosetta was born. During their stay in the village we see how everyone in the community has been reduced to the most basic needs because of the war. They have to think only about food and staying alive. Cesira and Rosetta also meets a young intellectual in this community, Michell. He represents innocence and hope. He believes that the world will change for good after the war. He also falls in love with Cesira, but she refuses to accept his advances because he is too idealistic for her taste. Later on, Michel is chosen by a group of Nazi soldiers to lead them through the mountains and gets killed. Cesira and Rosetta have to return to Rome when it is clear that the war is approaching its end, but they get raped in an abandoned church by soldiers who are clearly mercenaries that work for the Allied troops. This is the most shocking scene of all. With the rape, Cesira faces the reality that no one can escape from the destructiveness of war. Her daughter has lost her innocence in spite of all her attempts to protect her from the violence of the world. It is also interesting that this scene takes place in a church, which gives this tragic scene a greater meaning. The war is so pervasive that it filters through everywhere, leaving no human institution untouched. Also noticeable through the film is that we don't know exactly who is attacking or bombing. We get to see English soldiers, German soldiers, American troops, and even a Russian deserter, but the film presents them in an objective way. The film focuses on how people get affected by the war: people are dislocated from their communities, homeless, hungry, and have little time for the everyday rituals that keep people together. The scene where Michell tries to read the Bible storyabout Lazarus and then walks out in anger because the people are not really paying attention to him shows clearly how the war makes people think about basic needs.

389940,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6303934315,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[12, 14]","In 1961 TWO WOMEN was considered a shocker; over time, however, we have seen the trauma central to the film depicted on screen so often and so much more graphically that many will feel the film has lost its edge.  Even so, Sophia Loren's justly famous performance is powerful enough to keep one focused on the film, and she is extremely well supported with strong performances by the likes of Eleonora Brown, Jean-Paul Belmondo, and Raf Vallone.  De Sica's very simple, unpretentious presentation also continues to serve the film extremely well.Loren is a widow who runs a small grocery store in Rome during World War II, and when the war moves in upon the city she decides to take daughter Rosetta (Brown) to the small village where she herself was born, but safety proves elusive.  The trip to the village is frought with danger, and although the villagers have some safety in their isolation even they are subject to peril.  When the Allies begin to close in on Rome, Loren decides to return to the city on foot with her daughter--and unwittingly places both her and her daughter at the mercy of renegade soliders who, in a scene once considered extraordinary violent, rape both mother and daughter in a bombed out church.Loren's performance here is simply extraordinary, and she gives us a woman of peasant mentality who has acquired a somewhat urban edge through her life as a shopkeeper in Rome, totally believable in her tunnel-visioned toughness; if any one ever had doubts that Hollywood essentially wasted her talents, they need look no further than this film for proof.  Unfortunately, however, one need only look at the reviews here to realize how incredibly bad the prints of this film are.  And not to put too fine a point on it, the Madacy release (which shows Loren and Brown in black and white on the cover) is easily one of the most incredibly shoddy videotapes it has ever been my misfortune to encounter: the picture slips in and out of focus, is consistently grainy, and the sound quality is atrocious.  This is a film in desperate need of restoration--but until that happens, fans of world cinema will have to put up with it, for this is an important film that should be seen.

She is one of the most beautiful women every to have graced the cinema.I think of Loren has as a romantic comedy actress, although I know she has done many dramatic roles Usually in the dramatic roles, Loren is the romantic partner for the male lead but in TWO WOMEN, she is the star. This is her movie and no doubt it was a role of a lifetime. It's clear why she  won the Academy Award for Best Actress.In TWO WOMEN, we see not only Loren's stunning beauty but also her remarkable beauty. Loren stars as the feisty and independent Cesira. The young widow runs a small grocery store in war-torn Rome.  Cesira is trying to give her 13 year old daughter Rosetta a normal life despite the regular arial bombings and dangers. Finally a bomb strikes too close to the shop and Cesira decides that the countryside would be safer. She and Rosetta embark on a hourney to the safety of her small childhood village near Naples.We see the horrors of war on innocent civilians as the pair head south by train and then on foot. There is danger around every corner. Cities are bombed out and civilians are doing whatever they can to survive. No worries for tough Cesira. No one will hard her or her daughter. Eventually they find safety in the mountains near her village with people she knows.One of the refugees is Michele played by French actor Jean-Paul Belmondo. Michele (pronounced Me KEL A in Italian) is an idealistic young man who like many falls for the beautiful Cesira. He professes his love for Cesira, but what does fate have in store for them?I knew what the main premise of the story was and what happens to the ""two women"", but that incident comes very late in the movie and it is distburbing and heartbreaking. I had heard so much about that part of the story that it to all happen much earlier. This is a story of survival and a young mother's determination to protect her child. Loren shows her amazing acting ability in this once-in-a lifetime role.Like other reviewers, I have to take note of the particularly bad quality of this DVD. The cover shows a sultry Sophia Loren when most covers and pictures I have seen show her in the agony of war.  The video and audio qualities of this version were very substandard. I'm referring to the version listed as coming from Pro-Active Entertainment Group. The quality was almost unbearable and I am sorry it destroyed the artistry of the film.

Such movies as ""Open City"", ""Paisan"", etc. have done an impressive job of showing the challenges of life in a world turned upside down by the effects of war.  ""Two Women"" is another excellent example of the genre.In ""Two Women"", we follow a woman and her daughter in Rome as they attempt to avoid the dangers of the encroaching war front.  The daughter is becoming too nervous from all the bombing and mom (Sophia Loren), is a young widow with a number of concerns herself.  They sell off their assets and head towards the home place out in rural Italy.  In their journey for security, they encounter a variety of individuals from pacifist to fascist.  The bombs still fall and the soldiers still fight.  Each place they go to has it's own liabilities and they continue on until disaster strikes in the form of Allied Moroccan soldiers.  The results of this encounter bring out a clear message that was is Hell for everyone and the presence of good guys and bad guys doesn't change that fact.""Two Women"" tells a tale of confusion, dispair, and tragedy and it does so in a way that seems so innocent at first.  After all, it is in attemting to escape the dangers of war that leads Loren and her daughter to even greater dangers.  In telling this tale of futility, we are given an impressive view of the terrors and horrors of war.  The title of the movie acquires a true yet ironic meaning as we stumble to the end of this brilliant and dispairing movie.Sophia Loren deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in ""Two Women"".  It was, I understand, the first such award for a foreign-language movie.  Early in the movie, she is speaking to a male friend of hers who asks her what it was like to have married and loved her late husband who was such an old man.  I chuckled when I realized that the producer of ""Two Women"" was Carlo Ponti, the elder spouse of Loren's.

The acting is absolutely superb, and the young JP Belmondo is a great surprise.  The mother leaves Rome with her daughter for the bomb-free countryside, where she finds family and hides.  Of course, it doesn't work out that well, first for danger and hunger, then their fate at the hands of rogue soldiers.  The end is tragic but hopeful, as a new society is set to arise.Unfortunately, the quality of this dvd is extremely mediocre - fuzzy images, muffled sound, etc.Recommended for the art but not for the technical execution.",4,"great film, lousy copy",1108425600,"02 15, 2005",2005,635,"['wonderful', 'film', 'mother', 'struggling', 'preserve', 'safety', 'child', 'war-torn', 'Italy', 'acting', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'young', 'JP', 'Belmondo', 'great', 'surprise', 'mother', 'Rome', 'daughter', 'bomb-free', 'countryside', 'where', 'family', 'hides', 'course', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'well', 'first', 'danger', 'hunger', 'then', 'fate', 'hands', 'rogue', 'soldiers', 'end', 'tragic', 'hopeful', 'new', 'society', 'set', 'arise.Unfortunately', 'quality', 'dvd', 'extremely', 'mediocre', 'fuzzy', 'images', 'muffled', 'sound', 'etc.Recommended', 'art', 'not', 'technical', 'execution']",Two Women La Ciociara  VHS

The story is simple and elegant.  Loren and her daughter, played by Eleanore Brown have to leave Rome becuase it is being bomed by the Allies as it is occupied by the Nazi's.  The political situation is messed up and Mussolini is overthrown.  The Nazi's send in troops to meet the Allies at Salerno and a 21 day battle ensues (you can watch a great movie about this battle in A Walk In The Sun).This movie isn't about the war tough, it's about these two women surviving all of the horror that comes along with it.  These Two Women (La Ciociara) endure hardship and horror but make it through together.  The only drawback to this film is that most of the spotlight is on Loren's character while the rest of the movies actors are in the background.The Bonus Feature is pretty good also.
