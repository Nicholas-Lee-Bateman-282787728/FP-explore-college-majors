They are not two equal sides of the same coin.Butterfly Effect is a compelling, intriguing tale.  Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart give life to this story, full of hope and sadness.  How far will love take you to save the one that you love?  Can one's mental state alter reality?  Can the past be changed?This type of film comes along maybe once in a decade.  It deserved better recognition than it received.On the other hand, Butterfly Effect 2 is a film which could have been as good or better than the first film, but it has so many shortcomings and missed opportunities in the plot.It loses momentum as it degenerates into its various subplots and inane dialogue.Erica Durance and Gina Holden are the only bright spots in this film.  Unfortunately, I felt Gina Holden's talents were not utilized.  She is a fine actress and deserved a better story line.Eric Lively seemed bored.  He is a much better actor than the script and director showcased in this film.Butterfly Effect deserves 4 stars.  Butterfly Effect 2 receives 1 star.  Should you buy this double DVD?  Yes, but watch the Butterfly Effect 2 first.  Like they say, save the best for the last.",4,The Butterfly Effect/The Butterfly Effect 2,1241136000,"05 1, 2009",2009,1241,"['Butterfly', 'Effect', '/', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', '2These', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'as', 'different', 'night', 'day', 'are', 'not', 'two', 'equal', 'sides', 'same', 'coin.Butterfly', 'Effect', 'compelling', 'intriguing', 'tale', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'give', 'life', 'story', 'full', 'hope', 'sadness', 'How', 'far', 'will', 'love', 'take', 'save', 'one', 'love', 'Can', 'one', 'mental', 'state', 'alter', 'reality', 'Can', 'past', 'be', 'changed', 'type', 'film', 'along', 'maybe', 'once', 'decade', 'deserved', 'better', 'recognition', 'other', 'hand', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', '2', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'as', 'good', 'better', 'first', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'shortcomings', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'plot.It', 'momentum', 'various', 'subplots', 'inane', 'dialogue.Erica', 'Durance', 'Gina', 'Holden', 'are', 'only', 'bright', 'spots', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'felt', 'Gina', 'Holden', 'talents', 'were', 'not', 'utilized', 'fine', 'actress', 'deserved', 'better', 'story', 'line.Eric', 'Lively', 'seemed', 'bored', 'much', 'better', 'actor', 'script', 'director', 'showcased', 'film.Butterfly', 'Effect', '4', 'stars', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', '2', '1', 'star', 'Should', 'buy', 'double', 'DVD', 'Yes', 'watch', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', '2', 'first', 'say', 'save', 'best', 'last']",The Butterfly Effect / The Butterfly Effect 2

I didn't like him in That 70's Show, so it took a long timefor anyone to convince me to watch this movie.I was blown away.  It was one of the saddest movies I have ever seen.  Do you ever think about fate?  Isthere such a thing?  That, no matter what choices we make, we are doomed to screw up our lives and the livesof our friends?  The first B.E. was well-written, well-acted, and had me personally invested in the peopleinvolved.  Highly recommended.The second movie, however, was nothing but a pale, poor shadow of the first.  I was so bored, I wanted toturn it off halfway through, but I forced myself to finish it.  It never got any better.  Don't bother towatch B.E. 2.",3,Five stars for part one.
