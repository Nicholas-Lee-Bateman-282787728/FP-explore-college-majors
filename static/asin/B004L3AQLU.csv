The storyline really makes you hate lawyers and the drug companies (they are the problem along with the current administration); but I digress. Jamie (Jake) is a self-centered hedonist who's only goal is to put another notch on his belt or even better...put a notch on the belt while making money. Maggie (Anne) is a former artist who can't bear to get close to any one because she's scared to death she'll be left alone so she believes if she just shuts off her feelings she never get hurt. Jamie falls hard for Maggie and Maggie finally opens her heart. We know that the ""true"" ending will not be happy but we, as an audience, are willing to watch the present fairytale and be happy for them in the moment. One line that really hit me hard was ""I need you more than you need me.""...How many times have you felt like that?

1412768,A319Y83RT0MRVR,B004L3AQLU,AIROLF,"[10, 23]","I had read an article once in which Baz Luhrmann said that the trick to making his extravagant musicals is to take the most simplistic story and to animate it with songs and sets, thereby giving it oomph and life.It seems that Hollywood romantic comedies these days function with similar criteria in mind: take the most simplistic story of a boy-meets-girl-falls-in-love-with-girl-because-the-girl-doesn't-love-him-back and set it in extraordinary circumstances. The trend seems to necessary extend to including the characters that must have something grand to fight for and to have love conquer it all. In Love and Other Drugs, Edward Zwick, the director of legendary TV shows thirtysomething and My So-Called Life (and my personal favorites Relativity and Once and Again) asks his characters to have the kind of love that battles Parkinson's disease.Although it's noble and wonderful to have this huge emotion of love be the cure for diseases and the reason for world peace, it seems that the French have it better. The French romantic dramedies aren't about saving the world, one relationship at a time; instead they are about characters that most resemble real people, people who have the smallest problems and the smallest inclinations for a sliver of happiness. In non-Hollywood cinema, the story hardly needs to be grand, the only criteria is that the audience cares for the characters.Unfortunately, it's very hard to truly care for the characters of Zwick's latest film, the script for which was adapted from Jamie Reidy's Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman. Even though it takes two hours to tell their story, the viewer hardly knows who these characters are and is instead told to believe that they go through this momentous transformation by having met each other.The characters are poorly written and the actors who portray them struggle to bring their characters the honesty and the veracity that the storyline demands. Anne Hathaway is quite impressive, but often too much like her The Devil Wears Prada character, as a 26-year-old girl battling Parkinson's disease while trying to go about her daily life. In the end, Hathaway, who plays Maggie Murdock, an attractive, careless free spirit who doesn't have the freedom from her disease or from her unrealistic expectations of herself, doesn't elicit more than a forethought.Jake Gyllenhaal is Jamie Randall, a drug rep set on sleeping with anything that has the necessary female body parts. Gyllenhaal has never been sexier than in his role here but he is still short of being a convincing leading man. Gyllenhaal, whose talent is unquestionable (watch Donnie Darko, The Good Girl or Proof for a showcase of his acting skills), doesn't fit the role of a sly, sex maniac, and failed med student who uses hard sell techniques to get laid. In fact, I would almost be inclined to say that Gyllenhaal was miscast in his part here.Zwick's direction is ever-present. In one scene, Anne Hathaway squats and then leans across to Gyllenhaal, who is sitting in the bathtub. One can just see the director handing out directions of lean left, lean right, don't forget the audience is looking this way in that scene. That's one of the many instances in the film where the action feels unnatural - too staged, too rehearsed, too tried-and-true.Except for some (arguably unnecessary) nudity between the leads, the too-tired-and-true routine is the story of the film, i.e., there's nothing new in the film that would add to either the genre of romantic dramedy or to Zwick's already extensive career list of adult romantic movies.The film is set in 1996, and sadly, it doesn't seem that Edward Zwick has ever left that era.",3,love for this movie is only achievable on drugs,1296950400,"02 6, 2011",2011,3683,"['had', 'read', 'article', 'once', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'said', 'trick', 'making', 'extravagant', 'musicals', 'take', 'most', 'simplistic', 'story', 'animate', 'songs', 'sets', 'thereby', 'giving', 'oomph', 'life.It', 'Hollywood', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'days', 'function', 'similar', 'criteria', 'mind', 'take', 'most', 'simplistic', 'story', ""boy-meets-girl-falls-in-love-with-girl-because-the-girl-doesn't-love-him-back"", 'set', 'extraordinary', 'circumstances', 'trend', 'necessary', 'extend', 'including', 'characters', 'must', 'have', 'something', 'grand', 'fight', 'have', 'love', 'conquer', 'Love', 'Other', 'Drugs', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'director', 'legendary', 'TV', 'shows', 'thirtysomething', 'My', 'So-Called', 'Life', 'personal', 'favorites', 'Relativity', 'Once', 'Again', 'characters', 'have', 'kind', 'love', 'Parkinson', 'disease.Although', 'noble', 'wonderful', 'have', 'huge', 'emotion', 'love', 'be', 'cure', 'diseases', 'reason', 'world', 'peace', 'French', 'have', 'better', 'French', 'romantic', 'dramedies', 'are', ""n't"", 'saving', 'world', 'one', 'relationship', 'time', 'instead', 'are', 'characters', 'most', 'resemble', 'real', 'people', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'smallest', 'problems', 'smallest', 'inclinations', 'sliver', 'happiness', 'non-Hollywood', 'cinema', 'story', 'hardly', 'be', 'grand', 'only', 'criteria', 'audience', 'cares', 'characters.Unfortunately', 'very', 'hard', 'truly', 'care', 'characters', 'Zwick', 'latest', 'film', 'script', 'was', 'adapted', 'Jamie', 'Reidy', 'Hard', 'Sell', 'Evolution', 'Viagra', 'Salesman', 'Even', 'two', 'hours', 'tell', 'story', 'viewer', 'hardly', 'who', 'characters', 'are', 'instead', 'told', 'believe', 'go', 'momentous', 'transformation', 'having', 'met', 'other.The', 'characters', 'are', 'poorly', 'written', 'actors', 'who', 'portray', 'struggle', 'bring', 'characters', 'honesty', 'veracity', 'storyline', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'quite', 'impressive', 'often', 'too', 'much', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'character', '26-year-old', 'girl', 'battling', 'Parkinson', 'disease', 'trying', 'go', 'daily', 'life', 'end', 'Hathaway', 'who', 'Maggie', 'Murdock', 'attractive', 'careless', 'free', 'spirit', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'freedom', 'disease', 'unrealistic', 'expectations', ""n't"", 'elicit', 'more', 'forethought.Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Jamie', 'Randall', 'drug', 'rep', 'set', 'sleeping', 'anything', 'necessary', 'female', 'body', 'parts', 'Gyllenhaal', 'never', 'been', 'sexier', 'role', 'here', 'still', 'short', 'being', 'convincing', 'leading', 'man', 'Gyllenhaal', 'talent', 'unquestionable', 'watch', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'Good', 'Girl', 'Proof', 'showcase', 'acting', 'skills', ""n't"", 'fit', 'role', 'sly', 'sex', 'maniac', 'failed', 'med', 'student', 'who', 'hard', 'sell', 'techniques', 'get', 'laid', 'fact', 'would', 'almost', 'be', 'inclined', 'say', 'Gyllenhaal', 'was', 'miscast', 'part', 'here.Zwick', 'direction', 'ever-present', 'one', 'scene', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'squats', 'then', 'Gyllenhaal', 'who', 'sitting', 'bathtub', 'One', 'can', 'just', 'see', 'director', 'handing', 'out', 'directions', 'lean', 'left', 'lean', 'right', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'audience', 'looking', 'way', 'scene', 'one', 'many', 'instances', 'film', 'where', 'action', 'unnatural', 'too', 'staged', 'too', 'rehearsed', 'too', 'tried-and-true.Except', 'arguably', 'unnecessary', 'nudity', 'leads', 'too-tired-and-true', 'routine', 'story', 'film', 'i.e.', 'nothing', 'new', 'film', 'would', 'add', 'either', 'genre', 'romantic', 'dramedy', 'Zwick', 'already', 'extensive', 'career', 'list', 'adult', 'romantic', 'movies.The', 'film', 'set', '1996', 'sadly', ""n't"", 'seem', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'ever', 'left', 'era']",N/A

Knowing that the difficulties that lead to happiness can result in indescribable sadness? This movie gets to the core of such choices. At first, it seemed like an overly exposed romantic comedy with, might i add, surprising nudity, by a lead actress that seems to have a pattern with movies that end in grief ( ex. One Day). I almost turned it off once it became clear of her condition. A friend wisely steered me away from One Day and i felt like i was walking into another trap. Stayed with the movie because there was nothing else to do anyway. It was much deeper than portrayed and really showed  what a wonderful actress Anne really is. She is superb, and falls into the role, pulls conflicting emotions from you watching her. Jake's character grew from an overgrown child to...well, the kind of man we imagine him to be in real life ( ladies!)

In their somewhat drab dining room, having dinner with their grown kids. Almost screams, 'Poor but honest, human, down-to-earth.' In other words, 'Don't hate Dad because he's a doctor and rolling in money!'Then there's the chubby son who supposedly is so smart that he made a killing in the field of technology. He's too dumb to put any money in the bank, so soon, we're seeing him, again, 'poor but honest and down-to-earth, with self-esteem issues, just like you and me!'What crap.After the titillation of lots of skin shown when Jake and Anne Hathaway have sex (that part is pretty believable), Jake's character, Jamie, who's supposed to be such an emotional clod that he talks over the live broadast of the towers falling on 9/11, Jake and Maggie (her character) get serious. It's really a very touching scene when he first admits that he loves her - that was worth watching for the acting and the message conveyed - but when he starts to focus on her disease, everything goes awry.I'll skip all the things that happen and just say that it could have ended with the lovely emotional scene that seems to resolve many issues. I loved that scene. Then it was all ruined by a coda in which Jake tells us that he made a moral choice and applied to medical school.ENNNGHHH! (sound of buzzer). Wrong thing to add to the movie. Jake's already admitted that he can't sit through classes, was aimless in college and dropped out. In the competitive world of medical admissions, even Dad (a university professor, remember) would have trouble getting a son who's decided he wants to be doctor now into medical school. A son who refers to himself as having ADD. And that is expected to wrap up all of the plot in a neat little bow so the happy couple retire healthy and wealthy (the understanding is that Maggie will then have her own live-in doctor watching the progress of her disease).Without that stupid, cloying, and unbelievable ending, I was willing to overlook the 'poor but honest' facade presented by a family basically rolling in money, with plenty of options in life and lots of financial security, but living 'the simple (and drab) life' as if it was some political statement.

1412792,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B004L3AQLU,C. Sawin,"[3, 6]","I've never been a big fan of romantic comedies. They usually try too hard to be cute or are too heavy on romance and too light on comedy. Sitting through a string of romantic comedies when you're single isn't the best idea either as it just seems to remind you of what you currently don't have. But every once in a while a film labeled as a romantic comedy offers a little bit more than it lets on. Love & Other Drugs is such a film.Love & Other Drugs spends an equal amount of time giving a lesson in pharmaceutical sales that it does with the relationship between Jamie and Maggie. In between getting familiar with how easy it is for Jamie to get laid, we're introduced to how competitive it was for Zoloft to get off the ground when Prozac already ruled the world of anti-depressants in a 1996 world. Then a little blue pill came along called Viagra to help anyone with impotence and swept the world by storm. In addition to that, there's also a fair amount of screen time given to parkinson's disease as Maggie struggles with stage one of the disease as a 26-year-old. So Love & Other Drugs is basically a film about pharmaceutical sales while also giving the viewer an idea of what it's like to deal with an incurable disease at a young age first and a romantic comedy second.If the film still doesn't sound like the type of film for you, there's still a little bit of hope. Anne Hathaway is shown topless quite often in the film's 113 minute duration, so guys have something to look forward to if a girlfriend or wife is planning on making you sit through this any time soon. You pretty much see all of Jake Gyllenhaal as well other than a full frontal, so the ladies can oggle something as well. The real chemistry on-screen is obviously between Gyllenhaal and Hathaway, but also Gyllenhaal and Josh Gad who play brothers. Gad seems like a knockoff of Jonah Hill or some weird parallel universe version of him. With that being said, you can probably figure out that it's mostly emotional touchy-feely stuff between Gyllenhaal and Hathaway while the relationship between Gyllenhaal and Gad provides most of the laughs.Love & Other Drugs is probably mostly what you're expecting it to be, but it may contain more about pharmaceutical sales and parkinson's disease than the trailers let on. Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway do a decent job of making you care about the fate of a relationship between two people who try their hardest to pass themselves off as selfish jerks. The film is actually pretty similar to Knocked Up or a Judd Apatow production in general, at least in tone.

Unlike EPL, this film doesn't even have the nice scenery to make it mildly diverting - unless you count quite a few segments of nudity as scenery.

They begin a relationship of sorts that is anything but conventional. This movie is based on a true story, but after doing some research online, I've found that the film is very very very loosely based on actual events. That's not a surprise as so much of the story felt over-the-top and ridiculous. The acting is very good - but the two leads cannot save a script that has them both be unlikable and unrealistic. There is a plot line about a new job, Viagra, and the state of the country's healthcare system, but they don't really impact the story overall.While the film is under two hours, it felt much longer. At about twenty minutes in, I lost interest. It's so dull it's almost a crime. There isn't a whole lot more to say, other than I highly suggest passing on this waste.

As a matter of fact, this romantic ""comedy"" is much more than that; it is a multi-dimensional story that portrays passion, fear, angst, denial, ambition, humor, and love--to name but a few components.  It's a tender love story centering around Jamie (Jake Gyllenhaal), a pharmaceutical rep about to ride the crest of the Viagra wave, and Maggie (Hathaway), a devout free spirit experiencing Stage 1 Parkinson's.  Their relationship begins as bedroom buds (with plenty of sizzle), with both pledging physicality and nothing more; of course nothing of the sort happens, as Jamie falls head over heels, and Maggie, smitten herself, does her best to run him off as she becomes sicker.  The subsequent bittersweet story has its decided ups and downs, culminating in an ending predictable yet satisfying.Gyllenhall and Hathaway sport great chemistry and deliver solid, believable performances, but real props belong to the second tier of the cast, including Josh Gad as Jamie's nerdy, unlucky-at-love kid brother, and Olvier Platt as Jamie's supervisor.  The comedic energy both bring to their roles is hysterical, especially Gad as he surprises a scantily clad Maggie who has come over to Jamie's apartment for some carnal delight.  The two augment the plot very nicely, and deliver constant comic relief.  And that's a plus, because LOVE & OTHER DRUGS is much more than your run-of-the-mill romantic comedy.--D.

As a die-hard fan of romantic comedies, upon reading the synopsis, I wasn't too hopeful that it would fit neatly into the rom-com genre. Still, it sounded interesting enought to warrant watching. Now a few days later, the gravity of the movie still weighs heavily on my mind. It is rated 'R' for its nudity and sex scenes; it really should be rated 'M' for 'Mature' -- mature audience who have experienced life, that is. If one can look beyond the graphic scenes (not easy with Gyllenhaal's glorious physique flashing before our eyes every few minutes) as well as reserve moral judgement, one can see that the movie encompasses many of the issues that mankind is afraid of confronting, which, not coincidentally, are also the same ones that we find difficult to talk about with our children. For Hollywood to even be able to address such deep issues in one film is a laudable endeavour:- Fraility of the human condition, at any age- The aftermath of casual sex (what comes next, how to deal with it, etc.)- Human insecurities and self-doubt; everyone's latent desire to be loved 'as is'- The wild roller coaster of life that can lift one to the heights of euphoria one moment and plunge one into abject shadows the next- The ability to love 'in spite of', aka unconditional love- The depth (or shallowness) of human interactions that range from the comfortable, non-competitive brotherly love between Jamie and Josh to the aggressive, self-serving relationships forged by the pharmaceutical salespeopleOur experience with, and views on, some of those issues are harboured deep within our souls, never to be revealed; others, we are quite boldly vocal about. But all have seeded at least some thought in us, at one point or another.Both Jamie and Maggie wallow in self-pity -- she from the obvious and he from his ADHD. Both use their disability as shields against deeper feelings and forging more meaningful relationships -- she with men, he with his family. I could go on but no one wants to read a review that lengthy and heavy. Only the ending is predictable and uninspiring, as if the script writers have already expended too much thought and emotions and couldn't wait to end the story.

In ""Love and Other Drugs,"" the two play a couple madly in lust, and, despite their better judgment, love with one another.

Gyllenhaal plays Jamie as a lothario whose superficial charm masks a deep-seated emptiness. Hathaway's Maggie is full of sexual bravado and sharp-tongued wit, but scratch the surface and her character's anger and bitterness about her young-onset Parkinson's comes raging to the surface.The film is worth a watch just for the great performances and chemistry of its leads.

It suffers from downright ADD as it moves from a snapshot of manic arrested development to pharmaceutical satire to near-porn to romantic comedy to medical melodrama. That the film was directed by Edward Zwick (Glory) suddenly makes sense when you think about how he and fellow producer Marshall Hersokowitz created a similarly toned TV series,thirtysomething, back in the late eighties. Both of them also co-wrote the screenplay along with Charles Randolph based on James Reidy's 2005 book,Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman. However, what works over several TV seasons doesn't work as well within a 112-minute running time. Fortunately, Zwick chose two attractive leads, Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway, to star in this basically schizophrenic movie, and both perform admirably under the circumstances.Beginning in 1996, the plot revolves around Jamie Randall, a young medical school drop-out just fired from a sales job at an electronics store. A typical commitment-phobe, he manages to land a job through his younger brother Josh, an obnoxiously wealthy dot-commer, as a pharmaceutical rep for Pfizer selling Zoloft and eventually Viagra. While accompanying an influential doctor on his rounds, Jamie meets Maggie Murdock, a pretty free spirit with early onset Parkinson's disease. They waste little time in having sex, an arrangement that suits both their situations and libidos. However, it's inevitable that one wants more out of the relationship, and Jamie convinces Maggie to take it to the next level. At a Parkinson's convention in Chicago, they come away with a more palpable sense of what the long-term effects of the disease will be on Maggie. This naturally tests their relationship as they face the prospect of her condition worsening.More at home than as thePrince of Persiain the sixth century B.C., Gyllenhaal takes on a George Clooney-type role in Jamie with convincing self-assurance. Perhaps becauseThe Princess Diarieswill never entirely leave her screen persona (note her recent Oscar gig as evidence of her cheerleading tendencies), Hathaway does surprisingly well portraying a sexual hedonist keeping a deliberate emotional distance from everybody. The two banter sharply and handle their characters' sexual combustion with &eacute;lan. When the film threatens to move intoSweet November-type melodrama, the actors avert the heart-tugging predictability with their emotional alertness. As the chubby younger brother, Josh Gad is as irritating as an evasive fly in an unessential role designed to provide intermittent comic relief but failing miserably in what amounts to a Jonah Hill impersonation.The other actors are fine but make mostly truncated appearances - Oliver Platt as a blustery Pfizer salesman, Hank Azaria as the seasoned go-between doctor, Gabriel Macht as a competing rep with anger management issues, George Segal and the late Jill Clayburgh as Jamie's concerned parents in an early and all-too-brief dining table scene. It's also worth noting that Steven Fierberg's sharp cinematography captures the various Midwest locations really well, and Steven Rosenblum's action-movie-style editing captures the manic energy Zwick appears to have wanted during the film's first half. The 2011 DVD/Blu-Ray offers relatively few extras - about seven minutes of deleted scenes, the original theatrical trailer, and four quick featurettes (""Love & Other Drugs"": An Actor's Discussion"", ""Beautifully Complex: Anne Hathaway is Maggie"", ""Reformed Womanizer: Jake Gyllenhaal is Jamie"",  and ""Selling Love & Other Drugs"" which features Reidy.

1412823,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004L3AQLU,Grady Harp,"[38, 48]","LOVE AND OTHER DRUGS is based on Jamie Reidy's highly regarded novel 'Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesmen' and as adapted for the screen by Charles Randolph, Marshall Herskowitz and Edward Zwick (who also directs). It is a little jewel of a film.  If the portion of the film that deals far too long with a silly Radio City Music Hall show of Pfizer Pharmaceuticals training program bores the audience (it should have been severely edited for many reasons), it is worth the wait for the actual romance story that follows.Jamie Randall (Jake Gyllenhaal) can't hold a job, preferring to focus on womanizing, much to the disdain of his wealthy obese brother Josh (Josh Gad), and his parents (George Segal and Jill Clayburgh in a role that was to be her last). Jamie best friend Bruce (Oliver Platt) joins Jamie in becoming a pharmaceutical rep for Pfizer and the two are placed on the road to push Zoloft and Zithromax, finding that the market is hoarded by Trey Hannigan (Gabriel Macht), an Eli Lily  salesman selling Prozac.  Jamie encounters Trey in the office of Dr. Knight (Hank Azaria), studies Trey's success and his own failure, and in the process encounters a patient of Dr. Knight, the free spirited gorgeous Maggie Murdock (Anne Hathaway) who has been with both Trey and Dr. Knight.  Jamie's lack of success pushing Zoloft suddenly reverses when Pfizer comes out with Viagra: Jamie is a natural to be the leading salesman for this new enhancing drug - or is he? There is a strange chemistry that develops between Jamie and Maggie and despite their unlikely qualifications as relationship candidates, each finds in the other the qualities that turn wild one nighters into a solid love affair.  Maggie has Parkinsonism and that aspect alters the way each approach the relationship.  But it is the magic of how this blossoms into one the screen's best romances that is the gift of the film.The story is frequently disrupted with sidebars that are supposed to provide comic relief but in the end simply take up too much space away from Jamie and Maggie.  Had the film been edited to clean its shelves the way Jamie cleaned the physicians' sample shelves of Prozac the total product would have been even better.  What the film brings into focus is the enormously maturing talents of Gyllenhaal and Hathaway: they may just be the next great Hollywood silver screen couple.  This is 'a fine (and sensitive) romance' and well worth watching.

For those who are not fans of the genre, you would probably rate this movie 2 or 3 stars.Love and Other Drugs follows the same predictable path that most American romantic comedies follow. Maggie (Anne Hathaway) and Jamie (Jake Gylenhaal) do not like each other at first, slowly develop an attachment to each other, have a couple fights, etc...you get the picture. If you're looking for a movie that has a remarkable plot, this is not the one.But ""Love and Other Drugs"" may still hold some value to you. For one, there are a couple of nudity scenes, basically of topless women, which I guess would appeal to those who are looking for something provocative. And in the backdrop you find out about Jamie's incredibly successful career. After Jamie got fired from his salesman job at the electronics store, he began selling drugs to doctor's offices, and through his connections he found out about selling Viagra, which was a new drug in the 1990s, when this movie was set. It's surprising that a man with no academic background in the sciences nor business becomes a major pharmaceutical businessman, but that's what happened.

But as far as his father (George Segal), a successful doctor, is concerned, Jamie is wasting his potential and belongs in medical school instead. Then everything changes when Jamie goes to work for Big Pharma and strikes it rich in the billion-dollar bonanza of the release of the first erectile-dysfunction drug, Viagra, in the 1990s.Side-by-side with his ascendance as a high-earning drug salesman, light-hearted Jamie embarks on what he assumes will be simply one more in a long line of passing affairs with beautiful, twenty-six-year-old Maggie Murdock (Anne Hathaway). Maggie is in Stage 1 of Parkinson's disease and has no desire to form any close relationships, so theirs seems like an ideal pairing of superficial self-gratification. They swear to each other there will be nothing but hot, mindless sex between them (very reminiscent of the recent romantic comedies,No Strings AttachedandFriends With Benefits), but unfortunately for the success of their no-hearts-allowed pact, inconvenient feelings of friendship and romance arise between them.This movie is loosely based on the memoir by Jamie Reidy,Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman. It has been marketed by its promoters as as ""a satirical look inside the culture of Big Pharma"" as well as a romantic comedy, but it has more than a little ofCamilleandLove Storythrown in the mix as well.Many may find this movie the ideal ""date flick,"" because it's got bawdiness and nudity galore for the guys, and plenty of tear-jerking romance for the female portion of the audience. As one of those women, I certainly did like the ""chick"" parts the best, and the performances of these two very fine actors in the lead roles are definitely worth catching. They take what otherwise might be a confusing mishmash of a script and turn it into something quite watchable.By the way, Hathaway and Gyllenhaal obviously, as seems to be standard these days, had to work very, very hard with personal trainers to get utterly fit for their many, many nude scenes, and people who like to gawk at young, lithe bodies will appreciate that. It's too bad though, at least in my personal opinion, the vast majority of that nudity is gratuitous in that it contributed nothing to the story, merely providing (or so it seemed to me) prurient interest for the guys to keep them from getting too bored as they waded through the love-story portions of the film in order to return to the male-humor, Big Pharma antics that form the main body of the story.",3,"A mashup of bawdy, male humor, chick flick romance, and Camille-like tragedy",1337817600,"05 24, 2012",2012,2640,"['Twenty-something', 'Jamie', 'Randall', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'used', 'good', 'looks', 'flirtatious', 'charisma', 'years', 'become', 'highly', 'successful', 'salesman', 'as', 'far', 'father', 'George', 'Segal', 'successful', 'doctor', 'concerned', 'Jamie', 'wasting', 'potential', 'belongs', 'medical', 'school', 'instead', 'Then', 'everything', 'changes', 'when', 'Jamie', 'work', 'Big', 'Pharma', 'strikes', 'rich', 'billion-dollar', 'bonanza', 'release', 'first', 'erectile-dysfunction', 'drug', 'Viagra', '1990s.Side-by-side', 'ascendance', 'high-earning', 'drug', 'salesman', 'light-hearted', 'Jamie', 'embarks', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'simply', 'one', 'more', 'long', 'line', 'passing', 'affairs', 'beautiful', 'twenty-six-year-old', 'Maggie', 'Murdock', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Maggie', 'Stage', '1', 'Parkinson', 'disease', 'desire', 'form', 'close', 'relationships', 'so', 'theirs', 'ideal', 'pairing', 'superficial', 'self-gratification', 'swear', 'other', 'will', 'be', 'nothing', 'hot', 'mindless', 'sex', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'recent', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'No', 'Strings', 'Benefits', 'unfortunately', 'success', 'no-hearts-allowed', 'pact', 'inconvenient', 'feelings', 'friendship', 'romance', 'arise', 'them.This', 'movie', 'loosely', 'based', 'memoir', 'Jamie', 'Reidy', 'Hard', 'Sell', 'Evolution', 'Viagra', 'Salesman', 'been', 'marketed', 'promoters', 'satirical', 'look', 'culture', 'Big', 'Pharma', 'as', 'well', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'more', 'little', 'ofCamilleandLove', 'Storythrown', 'mix', 'well.Many', 'may', 'find', 'movie', 'ideal', 'date', 'flick', 'got', 'bawdiness', 'nudity', 'galore', 'guys', 'plenty', 'tear-jerking', 'romance', 'female', 'portion', 'audience', 'one', 'women', 'certainly', 'did', 'chick', 'parts', 'best', 'performances', 'two', 'very', 'fine', 'actors', 'lead', 'roles', 'are', 'definitely', 'worth', 'catching', 'take', 'what', 'otherwise', 'might', 'be', 'confusing', 'mishmash', 'script', 'turn', 'something', 'quite', 'watchable.By', 'way', 'Hathaway', 'Gyllenhaal', 'obviously', 'be', 'standard', 'days', 'had', 'work', 'very', 'very', 'hard', 'personal', 'trainers', 'get', 'utterly', 'fit', 'many', 'many', 'nude', 'scenes', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'gawk', 'young', 'lithe', 'bodies', 'will', 'appreciate', 'too', 'bad', 'least', 'personal', 'opinion', 'vast', 'majority', 'nudity', 'gratuitous', 'contributed', 'nothing', 'story', 'merely', 'providing', 'so', 'seemed', 'prurient', 'interest', 'guys', 'keep', 'getting', 'too', 'bored', 'waded', 'love-story', 'portions', 'film', 'order', 'return', 'male-humor', 'Big', 'Pharma', 'antics', 'form', 'main', 'body', 'story']",N/A

That said, it still felt odd to see quite so much nudity--I didn't think it fit with the seriousness of the subject matter (not the sex scenes themselves, but I was surprised at how many there were!).This movie is about loving someone with Parkinson's, but the trailers gave me the impression that it was a lighthearted romance, which is obviously not true.Overall I give it 4-stars.  A unusual story, great actors, and a relatively happy ending.  The negatives include the unlikability of several of the characters, as well as some of the things I mentioned above.

They begin one way and then suddenly do a 180 and I find myself watching a movie that is totally unlike the one I started with. Granted there are times this works, most notable in mysteries. But a movie that begins as a romantic comedy that turns into heavy drama is not a combination that works. Thus is the problem with LOVE & OTHER DRUGS.Jake Gyllenhaall is Jamie Randall, a smooth talking operator with an eye for beautiful women but on the short stack when it comes to handling a successful career or future. His brother Josh (Josh Gand) is a successful investor and his parents are two top people in the medical field. So what is Josh's problem?Put in touch by his brother with the folks at Pfizer, Jake takes on the improbably job of pharmaceutical sales man. He goes to classes, beds the instructor and is assigned to another agent (Oliver Platt) to help him along. Jamie applies his own knowledge and skills to get him into the good graces of Dr. Stan Knight (Hank Azaria), a doctor whose approval would result in other doctors following suit and choosing Jamie's drugs over those of his competitor.In his attempt to sway the doctor, Jamie passes along cash for the chance of following him through a single day. During that time he sits in on a patient consultation. Her name is Maggie Murdock (Anne Hathaway) and she's there just to get her prescriptions filled. She knows her problems, symptoms and likelihood of success but has little hope. She has Parkinson's disease. She's unusually young for this, but knows what to expect.When Maggie catches Jamie as a salesman instead of the intern he claimed to be, she gets angry. Then she finds herself attracted to him. And then the pair becomes full time lovers with no attachments. Until Jamie finds himself drawn to Maggie.The movie to this point has seemed like a combination romantic comedy and straight out romance story with quite a bit of nudity tossed in to appease the guys dragged to the movie so their girlfriends can check out Gyllenhaal's butt. And then it suddenly changes.Maggie understands what to expect in the near future but does Jamie? At a pharmaceutical convention, Jamie mingles with the crowd while Maggie finds a meeting of a support group for Parkinson's patients. The group inspires here, makes her feel alive for the first time in ages and makes her appreciate Jamie for being there for her. Except perhaps he isn't. At the same meeting he talks to one of the husbands of another patient who tells him if he had to do it all over again he would have run right away. This of course leads to the pair parting ways.But remember this is movieland. The odds of them getting together again after this are pretty good. Then again the movie changed from what seemed a comedy to a rather intense drama too so it's anyone's guess how the story will end.Is it any good? Not particularly. The lighter moments are tinged with quite a bit of cynicism. For those easily offended there is, as mentioned, plenty of gratuitous nudity and raunchy humor to boot. But the biggest problem is that with the exception of Maggie (due to her gut wrenching disease) there are not many sympathetic characters to be found here. Just single minded self interested people. How entertaining can that be?The acting is good, the cinematography well done and the general feeling of the film fine. With the exception and a story that feels schizophrenic and that doesn't involve the viewer as much as it should have.I will say that one thing that has bothered me in recent years is how women, in particular actresses in film, seem to have to remove their clothing before they will be considered actresses. If you want work, you have to take off your clothes otherwise you're designated uncompromising. The same doesn't hold true for male actors (though many are doing more partial nude scenes). So why is it that the value of a female actress is judged by the amount of clothing she's willing to remove but not men? Especially when actresses seem to be more involved with women's rights groups? Who knows?Some will enjoy the film for the sake of the nude scenes. Some will enjoy it because they find the leads attractive. And some will find the romantic storyline just what they're looking for. It just would have been nice if this movie were more focused on what it wanted to be from beginning to end. The way it stands, it feels more like a jumbled flick than an enjoyable one.",2,A FILM WITH MULTIPLE PERSONALITY DISORDER,1302134400,"04 7, 2011",2011,4513,"[""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'movies', 'just', 'have', ""n't"", 'quite', 'determined', 'what', 'want', 'be', 'begin', 'one', 'way', 'then', 'suddenly', 'do', '180', 'find', 'watching', 'movie', 'totally', 'one', 'started', 'Granted', 'are', 'times', 'most', 'notable', 'mysteries', 'movie', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'heavy', 'drama', 'not', 'combination', 'Thus', 'problem', 'LOVE', 'OTHER', 'DRUGS.Jake', 'Gyllenhaall', 'Jamie', 'Randall', 'smooth', 'talking', 'operator', 'eye', 'beautiful', 'women', 'short', 'stack', 'when', 'handling', 'successful', 'career', 'future', 'brother', 'Josh', 'Josh', 'Gand', 'successful', 'investor', 'parents', 'are', 'two', 'top', 'people', 'medical', 'field', 'what', 'Josh', 'problem', 'Put', 'touch', 'brother', 'folks', 'Pfizer', 'Jake', 'improbably', 'job', 'pharmaceutical', 'sales', 'man', 'classes', 'instructor', 'assigned', 'agent', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'help', 'along', 'Jamie', 'own', 'knowledge', 'skills', 'get', 'good', 'graces', 'Dr.', 'Stan', 'Knight', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'doctor', 'approval', 'would', 'result', 'other', 'doctors', 'following', 'suit', 'choosing', 'Jamie', 'drugs', 'competitor.In', 'attempt', 'sway', 'doctor', 'Jamie', 'cash', 'chance', 'following', 'single', 'day', 'time', 'patient', 'consultation', 'name', 'Maggie', 'Murdock', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'there', 'just', 'get', 'prescriptions', 'filled', 'problems', 'symptoms', 'likelihood', 'success', 'little', 'hope', 'Parkinson', 'disease', 'unusually', 'young', 'what', 'expect.When', 'Maggie', 'catches', 'Jamie', 'salesman', 'instead', 'intern', 'claimed', 'be', 'angry', 'Then', 'attracted', 'then', 'pair', 'full', 'time', 'lovers', 'attachments', 'Jamie', 'drawn', 'Maggie.The', 'movie', 'point', 'seemed', 'combination', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'straight', 'out', 'romance', 'story', 'bit', 'nudity', 'tossed', 'appease', 'guys', 'dragged', 'movie', 'girlfriends', 'can', 'check', 'out', 'Gyllenhaal', 'butt', 'then', 'suddenly', 'what', 'expect', 'near', 'future', 'Jamie', 'pharmaceutical', 'convention', 'Jamie', 'crowd', 'Maggie', 'meeting', 'support', 'group', 'Parkinson', 'patients', 'group', 'here', 'feel', 'alive', 'first', 'time', 'ages', 'appreciate', 'Jamie', 'being', 'perhaps', ""n't"", 'same', 'meeting', 'one', 'husbands', 'patient', 'who', 'had', 'do', 'over', 'again', 'would', 'have', 'run', 'right', 'away', 'course', 'leads', 'pair', 'parting', 'ways.But', 'remember', 'movieland', 'odds', 'getting', 'together', 'again', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'Then', 'again', 'movie', 'changed', 'what', 'seemed', 'comedy', 'rather', 'intense', 'drama', 'too', 'anyone', 'guess', 'how', 'story', 'will', 'end.Is', 'good', 'Not', 'particularly', 'lighter', 'moments', 'are', 'tinged', 'quite', 'bit', 'cynicism', 'easily', 'offended', 'mentioned', 'plenty', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'raunchy', 'humor', 'boot', 'biggest', 'problem', 'exception', 'Maggie', 'due', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'disease', 'are', 'not', 'many', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'Just', 'single', 'minded', 'self', 'interested', 'people', 'How', 'entertaining', 'can', 'be', 'acting', 'good', 'cinematography', 'well', 'done', 'general', 'feeling', 'film', 'fine', 'exception', 'story', 'schizophrenic', ""n't"", 'involve', 'viewer', 'as', 'much', 'should', 'have.I', 'will', 'say', 'one', 'thing', 'bothered', 'recent', 'years', 'how', 'women', 'particular', 'actresses', 'film', 'seem', 'have', 'remove', 'clothing', 'will', 'be', 'considered', 'actresses', 'want', 'work', 'have', 'take', 'off', 'clothes', 'otherwise', ""'re"", 'designated', 'uncompromising', 'same', ""n't"", 'hold', 'true', 'male', 'actors', 'many', 'are', 'doing', 'more', 'partial', 'nude', 'scenes', 'why', 'value', 'female', 'actress', 'judged', 'amount', 'clothing', 'willing', 'remove', 'not', 'men', 'Especially', 'when', 'actresses', 'seem', 'be', 'more', 'involved', 'women', 'rights', 'groups', 'Who', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'sake', 'nude', 'scenes', 'will', 'enjoy', 'find', 'leads', 'attractive', 'will', 'find', 'romantic', 'storyline', 'just', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'just', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'movie', 'were', 'more', 'focused', 'what', 'wanted', 'be', 'beginning', 'end', 'way', 'more', 'jumbled', 'flick', 'enjoyable', 'one']",N/A
1412860,AAYE34TCTNV2R,B004L3AQLU,MarlowesMom,"[1, 1]","""Love and Other Drugs"" combines a story that does not fit into any neat categories with an R rating for language and sex. This probably explains its lackluster box-office performance in the U.S. since we like our films to fit into single predictable genres and we would rather watch beheadings than a couple enjoying sex. Witness the complaint from the ""most helpful negative review"" that the movie can't decide what it wants to be.Based on a pharmaceutical salesman's memoir, ""Love and Other Drugs"" is messy, like life. There's some great comedy, some hard hits at corrupt, profit-driven health care industries and a nation that wants every problem fixed instantly with a pill, some very hot chemistry between stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway, and serious  reflection about the rewards and challenges of foregoing instant gratification for authentic commitment, whether to a relationship, or a career, or any other endeavor. Funny, sad and serious at the same time, it's like an indie film with an A-list cast.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Jamie Randall, a young man who lacked the attention span to finish college and backs into pharmaceutical sales after he is fired from his home electronics sales job for having sex at work. He's charming, smart, attractive and driven to succeed, but he lives entirely on the surface, with no introspection and never caring much about anything or anyone. While on a sales call, he meets Maggie Murdock, a young artist suffering from early-onset Parkinson's. Both of them just want casual sex initially, Jamie because that's what he's like and Maggie because she won't ask anyone to stick with her long-term knowing where her disease will take her. Gradually they come to mean more to each other than either of them planned.Both Gyllenhaal and Hathaway give the best performances I've seen from them. I cannot believe how much Hathaway has grown as an actress since ""The Devil Wears Prada."" She really does an amazing job capturing Maggie's mixture of pride, passion, fear and self-pity. Gyllenhaal, perfectly cast as the smooth-talking superficial Jamie who discovers more to himself than he ever suspected, reveals heretofore hidden comedic gifts. There are some nice supporting bits from Oliver Platt as Jamie's bitter sales partner Bruce, Josh Gad as Jamie's geeky brother who takes over his couch after his wife kicks him out of his house, and Hank Azaria as one of Jamie's doctor customers.""Love and Other Drugs"" sags and repeats itself at times, and backs itself into an inevitable corner between sentimentality and cynicism when it comes to the ending (probably handled as well as can be expected), so I can't give it five stars. However, it's a solid four stars for the fine performances and a story that will keep you thinking long afterwards.",4,Better Than Expected Semi-Romantic Dramedy,1339027200,"06 7, 2012",2012,2790,"['Love', 'Other', 'Drugs', 'story', 'not', 'fit', 'neat', 'categories', 'R', 'rating', 'language', 'sex', 'probably', 'lackluster', 'box-office', 'performance', 'U.S.', 'films', 'fit', 'single', 'predictable', 'genres', 'would', 'rather', 'watch', 'beheadings', 'couple', 'enjoying', 'sex', 'complaint', 'most', 'helpful', 'negative', 'review', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'what', 'be.Based', 'pharmaceutical', 'salesman', 'memoir', 'Love', 'Other', 'Drugs', 'messy', 'life', 'great', 'comedy', 'hard', 'hits', 'corrupt', 'profit-driven', 'health', 'care', 'industries', 'nation', 'problem', 'fixed', 'instantly', 'pill', 'very', 'hot', 'chemistry', 'stars', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'serious', 'reflection', 'rewards', 'challenges', 'foregoing', 'instant', 'gratification', 'authentic', 'commitment', 'relationship', 'career', 'other', 'endeavor', 'Funny', 'sad', 'serious', 'same', 'time', 'indie', 'film', 'A-list', 'cast.Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Jamie', 'Randall', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'lacked', 'attention', 'span', 'finish', 'college', 'pharmaceutical', 'sales', 'fired', 'home', 'electronics', 'sales', 'job', 'having', 'sex', 'work', 'charming', 'smart', 'attractive', 'driven', 'succeed', 'entirely', 'surface', 'introspection', 'never', 'caring', 'much', 'anything', 'anyone', 'sales', 'call', 'Maggie', 'Murdock', 'young', 'artist', 'suffering', 'early-onset', 'Parkinson', 'just', 'want', 'casual', 'sex', 'initially', 'Jamie', 'what', 'Maggie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ask', 'anyone', 'stick', 'long-term', 'knowing', 'where', 'disease', 'will', 'take', 'Gradually', 'come', 'mean', 'more', 'other', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Hathaway', 'give', 'best', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'how', 'much', 'Hathaway', 'grown', 'actress', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'really', 'amazing', 'job', 'capturing', 'Maggie', 'mixture', 'pride', 'passion', 'fear', 'self-pity', 'Gyllenhaal', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'smooth-talking', 'superficial', 'Jamie', 'who', 'more', 'ever', 'suspected', 'reveals', 'heretofore', 'hidden', 'comedic', 'gifts', 'are', 'nice', 'supporting', 'bits', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'Jamie', 'bitter', 'sales', 'partner', 'Bruce', 'Josh', 'Gad', 'Jamie', 'geeky', 'brother', 'who', 'couch', 'wife', 'house', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'one', 'Jamie', 'doctor', 'customers', 'Love', 'Other', 'Drugs', 'sags', 'repeats', 'times', 'inevitable', 'corner', 'sentimentality', 'cynicism', 'when', 'ending', 'probably', 'handled', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'However', 'solid', 'four', 'stars', 'fine', 'performances', 'story', 'will', 'keep', 'thinking', 'long', 'afterwards']",N/A

It has the occasional truly funny moment and an overall enjoyable storyline. Viagra salesman Jamie meets Parkinson's patient Maggie: both are into sport sex only and both refuse to fall in love. Naturally, things don't go quite the way they expect. Within the parameters of Hollywood romance, nothing is particularly surprising but the stops along the way to the inevitable conclusion are entertaining, sometimes hilarious. Jamie's brother, played by Josh Gad, is an especially fantastic bit of character work that gives Jamie's character perspective in the best of ways. The acting is very good from all the cast, the basic story is fairly fresh and new and the handling of Hathaway's character's illness is done right on the line of being realistic enough to have some weight and still be light enough for a fluffy romantic film (ie she's sick but she never looks unattractive even at the worst of it).

At the core of the movie however is a very good love story between a womanizing sales rep played by Gyllenhaal and an early onset Parkinson's patient, played by Hathaway.  The two have very good chemistry together, which makes the movie.They start out with what seems like the perfect relationship for each other.  Neither wants a romantic entanglement and just want it to be about the sex.  The movie earns an R rating, because you see pretty much everything aside from total full frontal nudity from both actors.  Of course by the end of the movie they both admit to being in love, but the story in between where he comes to grips with her disease (and in a sense so does she) and he goes from trying to cure her to just agreeing to be there for her is where the movie shines.It is part romantic comedy, part raunchy sex comedy, part drama and blends them all well.

Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaall were both nominated by the Golden Globes for their roles. First off, let me get this out of the way. Yes, there is a ton of nudity in this film as well as sexual moves that adds a great deal of sensitivity and authenticity to this tale about two lovers who had no plans to become lovers. The main character is a sales guy type who decides to makes something of himself (partly to impress his family) by becoming a drug rep and it's right around this time that Viagra is released which leads to new sexual experiences for a lot of people, including older doctor clients of the main character. But it's really about love being the ultimate drug and puts a great deal of focus upon why these two people fall in love with some nice humorous scenes to boot. The main character's brother is an awesome sidekick who walks in on them doing you know what and even steals a sex tape they made together. But on a deeper level the fun all sobers up as the main character sees the ugly side of the early disease stages of his lover, Parkinson's Disease. What will he do? Well, this is Hollywood so you know it's probably going to be the safe ending but then again maybe not as I'm not telling entirely. The budget for this film was $30M and it made over $120M at the Box Office.

He said he could help me and gave me boxes of Celebrex that fixed my back in no time.  It turned out that he was a pharm. rep and the rest of the group was all doctors.  He paid for the whole thing (over $500).One more thing.  Towards the end of the movie Maggie complains that the life is not fair.  I also hear the same thing from my children.

Because it this film, Anne bares it all, and I mean IT ALL...In Love & Other Drugs, Jaimie Randall  (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a drug pusher, but not the kind that works on the street corner. He is peddling the legal kind of drugs from Zantex to Viagra. In his efforts to land a deal with a local doctor, he meets Maggie Murdock (Anne Hathaway), a beautiful young woman who is in the first stages of Parkinson's disease.  They form a bond fairly quickly. At first it starts out as just a physical thing.  Jaimie has always been a playboy and Maggie doesn't want to burden anyone with her disease. But as time goes by, the playboy learns he has a heart after all, and that he is falling in love with the free spirited Maggie. The only problem is, she doesn't want to be a burden. The toy of them most come to terms with their fears if there relationship is ever going to go to the next level.Love & Other Drugs is an endearing love story that shows that love really can conquer all, we just have to be brave enough to let it.

The seriousness of their situation is lightened by many humorous scenes and the sex scenes are spicy without being vulgar.

I mean, you have the cocky handsome guy--insert Jake here. Along with the gutsy, independent girl (who happens to be a knockout)--see Anne there.I mean, who wouldn't go for this coupling? They're two very attractive and likeable people. And they have chemistry pouring out of...well, their pores. (Note to Jake and Anne: Are the two of you guys SURE you don't want to go out on a date? I think I'm seeing something here that could very well possibly translate to real life.) Just a thought?Anyway, my thoughts on this film is that it's very likeable in that 'sweet light-hearted' way that you'd want a 'sweet light-hearted' film like this to be.Oh yeah, and the Anne Hathaway character has Parkinsons.Don't worry, it's not dealt with in the serious way that a movie like this wouldn't even deserve. It's just put out there to show Anne as this really 'aw shucks' determined kind of person. Who no matter what, is going to be beautiful and strong and sexy and everything else that everybody on the planet wishes they could be too.And I think as the movie goes along, it does a good job in showing the growth in the characters. I mean at first Maggie (Anne's character) only wants to have all this 'free sex' with none of the strings because I'm guessing she doesn't want her potential suitors to be around when her illness starts to go south.And you get to see the Jamie character (Jake) slowly turn into this person who just doesn't want to have mindless sex either. Because as the story goes along, it's like they only want to be together.  And in the movie, you can see how this relationship is slowly forged.

Though the role of a womanizer has been done time and time again, Jake Gyllenhaal) does not overdo it and therefore makes his performance more believible and makes an audience root for him in the end...I'm assuming that was a goal of the filmmakers here.  Anne Hathaway plays a ""leading lady"" who is anything but a stereotypical leading lady.

1412884,AZ9JWGE1UGKZA,B004L3AQLU,R.A. McKenzie,"[2, 3]","""Love & Other Drugs"" is definitely one of the strangest movies I've seen.  It made me laugh hard.  It tried to make me cry.  It showed me a fictional glimpse into pharmaceutical sales.  It took me back to the 90s, yet felt like it belonged in our modern age of movies.  It has funny love-making.  It has dramatic love-making.  Quite frankly, it tries to do just about everything except gratuitous violence....well, no there's a brief violent encounter too.The bottom line is that amidst all this genre-bending and blending, there's a sweet movie in here.  By the very end, ""Love & Other Drugs"" actually has something to say and people worth caring about.  It just takes some crazy-ass steps to get there, and that's sure to turn off some viewers.  Every movie deserves a chance, but I won't be surprised that this solid movie (IMO) will take too long to find what most audiences hope to see from a talented director like Edward Zwick (""Glory"", ""The Last Samurai"") and a beautiful cast that includes Jake Gyllenhaal, Anne Hathaway, and perhaps one too many women that take their clothes off.The story is a bit tough to explain, but I'll try.  Jamie (played by Gyllenhaal) is a man with no direction, bouncing from one woman and one job to the next.  When he gives pharmaceutical sales work a try, it turns out he has a knack for it.  Along the way, he meets Maggie (played by Hathaway), a Parkinsons patient who feels understandably violated when he poses as an intern during a sales visit, but eventually coerces him into a casual sex relationship.  Like just about every movie that involves impersonal sexual relationships, things eventually get complicated.  Will you be able to predict where the story goes?  The start & finish perhaps, but the journey from end to end is pretty unusual.  Along the way, you meet Jamie's annoying/hilarious brother (you'll have to decide for yourself which one he is).  There's a jealous ex-boyfriend, sales competition, discussions involving real-life drugs like Viagra, and a whole lotta sex.You'll have to forgive me if you notice I've typed a lot about the sexual nature of this romantic comedy/drama, because quite frankly, the movie throws a lot at you.  I kid you not, there are literally at least 7 graphic scenes involving nudity and/or lovemaking, and a few more implied encounters.  What is the point of all this sex?  Am I supposed to laugh at it?  Observe distantly?  Masturbate to it?  Your guess is as good as mine with some of these sequences.  I'm not saying graphic sex is a bad thing in movies --- hell, I love ""Brokeback Mountain"", ""Mulholland Drive"", and the TV show ""Tell Me You Love Me"".  My problem is that ""Love & Other Drugs"" doesn't need to push as far as it does.  I think director Zwick really misread the fine line between honesty and softcore pornography.  This is a great shock because he co-produced the great TV show ""Thirtysomething"", which handled adult relationships about as honestly and delicately as any other TV or film drama.But I've let my criticisms run amock, because even though I'm not 'recommending' it to people, I still think it's a solid movie.  Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway have are gifted actors with terrific chemistry, and the supporting cast is very good, especially the funny Oliver Platt as Jamie's mentor & Hank Azaria as Jamie's most sought-after client.  The plot moves at a breezy pace and never bored me, even if some of is totally unnecessary.  The movie needlessly spends some time with Jamie's family, and none of it pays off except for some arguable laughs from Josh Gad's love-him (ME) or hate-him (YOU?) performance as Jamie's brother.  But when all is said and done, watching Gyllenhaal and Hathaway tell the story of a couple's ups-and-downs moved me.The best thing you can do with a movie is say how it made you feel.  ""Love & Other Drugs"" made me chuckle quite a bit, and warmed my heart a little.  Hope that helps, because I don't think there's anything else quite like this one.",4,"Everything Thrown To The Wall, Enough Of It Sticks For Me",1301011200,"03 25, 2011",2011,3994,"['Love', 'Other', 'Drugs', 'definitely', 'one', 'strangest', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'made', 'laugh', 'hard', 'tried', 'make', 'cry', 'showed', 'fictional', 'glimpse', 'pharmaceutical', 'sales', 'took', 'back', '90s', 'yet', 'felt', 'belonged', 'modern', 'age', 'movies', 'funny', 'love-making', 'dramatic', 'love-making', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'do', 'just', 'everything', 'gratuitous', 'violence', '.well', 'brief', 'violent', 'encounter', 'too.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'amidst', 'genre-bending', 'blending', 'sweet', 'movie', 'here', 'very', 'end', 'Love', 'Other', 'Drugs', 'actually', 'something', 'say', 'people', 'caring', 'about', 'just', 'crazy-ass', 'steps', 'get', 'there', 'sure', 'turn', 'off', 'viewers', 'movie', 'chance', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'solid', 'movie', 'IMO', 'will', 'take', 'too', 'long', 'find', 'what', 'most', 'audiences', 'hope', 'see', 'talented', 'director', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'Glory', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'beautiful', 'cast', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'perhaps', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'women', 'take', 'clothes', 'story', 'bit', 'tough', 'explain', ""'ll"", 'try', 'Jamie', 'played', 'Gyllenhaal', 'man', 'direction', 'bouncing', 'one', 'woman', 'one', 'job', 'next', 'When', 'pharmaceutical', 'sales', 'work', 'try', 'out', 'knack', 'way', 'Maggie', 'played', 'Hathaway', 'Parkinsons', 'patient', 'who', 'understandably', 'violated', 'when', 'intern', 'sales', 'visit', 'eventually', 'casual', 'sex', 'relationship', 'just', 'movie', 'impersonal', 'sexual', 'relationships', 'things', 'eventually', 'get', 'complicated', 'Will', 'be', 'able', 'predict', 'where', 'story', 'start', 'finish', 'perhaps', 'journey', 'end', 'end', 'pretty', 'unusual', 'way', 'meet', 'Jamie', 'annoying/hilarious', 'brother', ""'ll"", 'have', 'decide', 'one', 'jealous', 'ex-boyfriend', 'sales', 'competition', 'discussions', 'involving', 'real-life', 'drugs', 'Viagra', 'whole', 'lotta', 'sex.You', ""'ll"", 'have', 'forgive', 'notice', ""'ve"", 'typed', 'lot', 'sexual', 'nature', 'romantic', 'comedy/drama', 'quite', 'frankly', 'movie', 'lot', 'kid', 'not', 'are', 'literally', 'least', '7', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'involving', 'nudity', 'and/or', 'lovemaking', 'few', 'more', 'implied', 'encounters', 'What', 'point', 'sex', 'Am', 'supposed', 'laugh', 'Observe', 'distantly', 'Masturbate', 'guess', 'as', 'good', 'mine', 'sequences', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'graphic', 'sex', 'bad', 'thing', 'movies', 'hell', 'love', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', 'TV', 'show', 'Tell', 'Me', 'Love', 'problem', 'Love', 'Other', 'Drugs', ""n't"", 'need', 'push', 'as', 'far', 'think', 'director', 'Zwick', 'really', 'misread', 'fine', 'line', 'honesty', 'softcore', 'pornography', 'great', 'shock', 'co-produced', 'great', 'TV', 'show', 'Thirtysomething', 'handled', 'adult', 'relationships', 'as', 'honestly', 'delicately', 'other', 'TV', 'film', 'drama.But', ""'ve"", 'let', 'criticisms', 'run', 'amock', 'even', ""'m"", 'not', ""'recommending"", 'people', 'still', 'think', 'solid', 'movie', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'have', 'are', 'gifted', 'actors', 'terrific', 'chemistry', 'supporting', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'especially', 'funny', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'Jamie', 'mentor', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'Jamie', 'most', 'sought-after', 'client', 'plot', 'moves', 'breezy', 'pace', 'never', 'bored', 'even', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'movie', 'needlessly', 'time', 'Jamie', 'family', 'none', 'off', 'arguable', 'laughs', 'Josh', 'Gad', 'love-him', 'ME', 'hate-him', 'YOU', 'performance', 'Jamie', 'brother', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'watching', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Hathaway', 'tell', 'story', 'couple', 'ups-and-downs', 'moved', 'me.The', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'do', 'movie', 'say', 'how', 'made', 'feel', 'Love', 'Other', 'Drugs', 'made', 'chuckle', 'quite', 'bit', 'warmed', 'heart', 'little', 'Hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'else', 'quite', 'one']",N/A

If true love is mysterious, then I guess it can also be cruel.Usually, I don't think much of Anne Hathaway as a girl to pursue for love.  But, she actually did fit the part of a woman with a deep rooted problem (Parkinson's).  She's got a trashy look about her, so I would expect that a good looking guy like Jake Gyllenhaal could have easily pursued any other girl who would have had her act together more.  Anne Hathaway was trying to push him away.  So, I would have certainly taken her advice from the word ""go"", from the very first abrasive moment she threw at him.  Especially after getting a ""head's up"" from a man who married a woman with Parkinson's disease. The man even told him that, if he had to do it all over again, he certainly would have moved on and looked for a relationship with somebody else.  That would be all that I'd need to hear.Anyway, this movie is probably true to life about dealing with someone with Parkinson's Disease.

I was blown away with the last scene, as Maggie is stripped of all her vulgarity and bluster, and revealed to be a hurting individual who has erected a shield to keep her from embracing the remote possibility that someone could love her, Parkinson's notwithstanding.My personal theory, as to why these two actors took these roles? Hathaway, at the time, had come off movies portraying her as syrupy sweet and/or as a confused bimbo. She might have been drawn to a role where she could shed that Princess persona, and shock a few people with dropping some F-bombs and nudity here and there. Gyllenhaal had also come off a movie, in the absolute last persona he'd want to be stereotyped as: gay.. He might have felt a need to play a solvent heterosexual role.Speculation, sure.

1412911,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B004L3AQLU,Z Hayes,"[3, 4]","My husband picked this movie out because I requested a romantic comedy and apparently this movie was touted as one. Anyway, midway through, it became pretty clear this was no romantic comedy.  Don't get me wrong, there are some laughs in here, especially at the beginning when Jamie, the character played by Jake Gyllenhaal shows off his consummate sales skills, and the consequences of his womanizing ways. This guy beds them and leaves them without so much as a thought, but things change when Jamie becomes a sales rep for Pfizer, trying to push Zoloft on doctors.Here, Jamie meets Maggie (Anne Hathaway in a gripping performance) - she suffers from early onset Parkinsons despite being only 26 years old, and though they get off to a rocky start, the pair eventually begin seeing each other, mainly on a casual, strictly sex-only relationship. But, life gets more complicated as Jamie begins to develop deeper feelings for Maggie, and the bulk of the movie explores this complicated, multi-faceted relationship. The core of the story boils down to whether Maggie is prepared to allow Jamie into all aspects of her life, and thus leave herself vulnerable to the very real threat that he may walk out when he realizes the complications that come with Maggie's condition.I felt the sexual chemistry between the two leads was credible and the sex scenes were tasteful and well done. Both actors appeared totally comfortable in their own skins, and viewers get to see plenty of Gyllenhaal and Hathaway in the buff - sex is an integral part of this movie, and not just between the two leads. Viewers also get to see a pajama party in full swing, numerous sexual encounters between the various characters, but it is all part of the story, especially given that Jamie eventually proves his sales skills by peddling Viagra and being very successful at it.It is the two lead performances that kept me engaged and I felt it was a decent effort. Though I would not characterize these roles as the actors' career best, the roles seemed more well-defined through their performances. I also loved one of the songs on the soundtrack, i.e. Billy Bragg's Way Over Yonder in the Minor Key, which I had never heard before and am glad to have discovered through this movie.",3,3.5* - Falls somewhere in between comedy and drama,1301875200,"04 4, 2011",2011,2256,"['husband', 'picked', 'movie', 'requested', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'apparently', 'movie', 'was', 'touted', 'one', 'Anyway', 'midway', 'became', 'pretty', 'clear', 'was', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'are', 'laughs', 'here', 'especially', 'beginning', 'when', 'Jamie', 'character', 'played', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'consummate', 'sales', 'skills', 'consequences', 'womanizing', 'ways', 'guy', 'so', 'much', 'thought', 'things', 'change', 'when', 'Jamie', 'sales', 'rep', 'Pfizer', 'trying', 'push', 'Zoloft', 'doctors.Here', 'Jamie', 'Maggie', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'gripping', 'performance', 'early', 'onset', 'Parkinsons', 'being', 'only', '26', 'years', 'old', 'get', 'rocky', 'start', 'pair', 'eventually', 'begin', 'seeing', 'other', 'mainly', 'casual', 'strictly', 'sex-only', 'relationship', 'life', 'more', 'complicated', 'Jamie', 'develop', 'deeper', 'feelings', 'Maggie', 'bulk', 'movie', 'complicated', 'multi-faceted', 'relationship', 'core', 'story', 'down', 'Maggie', 'prepared', 'allow', 'Jamie', 'aspects', 'life', 'thus', 'leave', 'vulnerable', 'very', 'real', 'threat', 'may', 'walk', 'out', 'when', 'complications', 'come', 'Maggie', 'condition.I', 'felt', 'sexual', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'was', 'credible', 'sex', 'scenes', 'were', 'tasteful', 'well', 'done', 'actors', 'appeared', 'totally', 'comfortable', 'own', 'skins', 'viewers', 'get', 'see', 'plenty', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Hathaway', 'buff', 'sex', 'integral', 'part', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'two', 'leads', 'Viewers', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'pajama', 'party', 'full', 'swing', 'numerous', 'sexual', 'encounters', 'various', 'characters', 'part', 'story', 'especially', 'given', 'Jamie', 'eventually', 'sales', 'skills', 'peddling', 'Viagra', 'being', 'very', 'successful', 'it.It', 'two', 'lead', 'performances', 'kept', 'engaged', 'felt', 'was', 'decent', 'effort', 'would', 'not', 'characterize', 'roles', 'actors', 'career', 'best', 'roles', 'seemed', 'more', 'well-defined', 'performances', 'also', 'loved', 'one', 'songs', 'soundtrack', 'i.e', 'Billy', 'Bragg', 'Way', 'Over', 'Yonder', 'Minor', 'Key', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'am', 'glad', 'have', 'discovered', 'movie']",N/A
