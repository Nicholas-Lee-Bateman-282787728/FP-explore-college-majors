1170963,AGEIT17HENDIS,B001B8C9UO,Alfred Johnson,"[3, 4]","Yes, there were men who knew too much before actor Jimmy Stewart came on the scene in the1950s version of the film under review, Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much. While there are many differences between the versions (color versus black and white, known actors, known by me, in the latter, stiff upper American lip rather than British) the main idea is still there, nefarious people are afoot in the world trying to unseat the democratic ideals (1930s fascism, 1950s red scare cold war) and ordinary citizens had better be prepared to act when necessary to thwart such evil designs against the peace. Especially when given cryptic, very cryptic last words by professional spies who, in fact, do know too much and are subject to an off-hand assassination for their efforts.And that thread is what this film hangs its hat on. Ordinary  people (well, not really ordinary but rather from good families) can be made ready to do battle for king and country even in appeasement 1930s after the blood-letting of  World War I left many things still unresolved in Europe (and the, uh, colonies) when provoked. And provocation is very easily stirred when the bad guys (led by 1930s arch-villain Peter Lorre and his lumpen henchmen working under cover of some dockside London sun-king cult) decide to insure that quiet for their deeds by kidnapping that quintessential proper English family's daughter. Yes, thems fighting words.Of course after some arch posturing and so-called humorous aside moments the villains are unearthed and the proper authorities are called to provide a little off-hand firing power to subdue them. Daughter saved. From an archeological point the most interesting part of the film is when the bad guys decide to go boom-boom and the then gun-less on principle Bobbies have to round up guns and ammo from a gunsmith.  By the 1950s Jimmy Stewart is able to call on half the armed forces of the world to prevent murder and mayhem from thundering down on Europe.

1170967,AWN6ZMWWMUWLX,B001B8C9UO,J. Friday,"[5, 15]","The plot: An English couple on vacation in Switzerland are given info on an intended assasination from a dying spy. Unfortunately for them the would-be assasins know they have the info and deside to kidnap the couple's daughter, using her as a hostage so they won't talk. Now it's up to the couple to find a way to safely find their daughter.Simply put, I just did not like this movie. I watched it twice because I thought I'd understand it the second time, but during both times I was tempted to turn it off halfway through. Throughout the film I kept on shaking my head, thinking, Now I can see why Hitchcock remade this film. Here some reasons why I didn't like it:1. Important characters are thrown in the picture with no introduction and no background info given on how the English couple know them (i.e. how did they happen to know the dying spy in the first place?).2. This is more of a light-hearted comedy than a thriller or a suspense yarn. The husband is actually friendly with the men who kidnapped his daughter. When he's kidnapped in the building of the Sun Cult he smiles cheerfully to Peter Lorre and says, ""Oh hello!"" lightheartedly (the guy kidnaps your daughter and you're making friendly conversation with him?).3. There is poor, wooden, and ho-hum acting from everyone, even Peter Lorre. I actually see the English mother stifling a giggle during a scene that is supposed to be tense.4. The editing is poor and so are the camera shots. During the beginning, the people clapping outside at the sky jump sound like they are indoors.5. I constantly kept yelling at the screen for people to show some emotion or put some feeling into it. The actors all seem bored and put as much energy into their performances as Garrison Keilor puts into his show (I'm not kidding).All in all the story itself is definitely below the level of the remake. This is the only Hitchcock film Hitchcock remade and it isn't hard to see why.

Instead the wife is a skeet shooter who is with daughter and husband.  The wife later dances with the guy who turns out to be a spy.  Interesting that a piece of glass breaks as a bullet creates a red blossom on the spy's shirt.  As he dies he gives the wife the clue needed.But alas the man finds the paper from his wife and the spies kidnap their daughter to keep their mouths shut.Unlike the 1950s version, there is not a lot of comedy and certainly no strains of Que Sera Sera.  There is a lot of British propriety and at times an annoying sense of calm during the shoot-out near the end of the film.Preserved is the Albert Hall scene where the gun peeks out from a curtain and thanks to Jill's scream, the assassin attempt is foiled.But I don't understand why the long, drawn-out shoot-out!  These guys were surrounded and the spy leader, played wonderfully by Peter Lorre, wanted to shoot as many cops as possible.  They were shooting a LOT of bullets!This film is darker than the 50s version, a lot less comedy and more than obvious commentary on police, the propriety of British society and the whimsy of a little girl who is used as a pawn in this international game of espionage and murder.Quite a story!Check out the Hitchcock Remake:The Man Who Knew Too Much",4,"A Bit Too British, Fun to Watch!",1331337600,"03 10, 2012",2012,1690,"['Hitchcock', 'original', '1934', 'version', 'Man', 'Who', 'Knew', 'Too', 'Much', 'exciting', 'though', 'times', 'plodding', 'film', 'where', 'assassin', 'gang', 'spy', 'who', 'was', 'deliver', 'message', 'would', 'stop', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'foreign', 'dignitary.Hitchcock', 'film', 'was', 'done', 'talented', 'amateur', 'heck', 'was', 'being', 'modest.As', 'later', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'version', 'family', 'out', 'not', 'vacation', 'Instead', 'wife', 'skeet', 'shooter', 'who', 'daughter', 'husband', 'wife', 'later', 'guy', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'spy', 'Interesting', 'piece', 'glass', 'breaks', 'bullet', 'red', 'blossom', 'spy', 'shirt', 'wife', 'clue', 'needed.But', 'man', 'paper', 'wife', 'spies', 'kidnap', 'daughter', 'keep', 'mouths', '1950s', 'version', 'not', 'lot', 'comedy', 'certainly', 'strains', 'Que', 'Sera', 'Sera', 'lot', 'British', 'propriety', 'times', 'annoying', 'sense', 'calm', 'shoot-out', 'end', 'film.Preserved', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'scene', 'where', 'gun', 'out', 'curtain', 'thanks', 'Jill', 'scream', 'assassin', 'attempt', 'foiled.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'long', 'drawn-out', 'shoot-out', 'guys', 'were', 'surrounded', 'spy', 'leader', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Peter', 'Lorre', 'wanted', 'shoot', 'many', 'cops', 'possible', 'were', 'shooting', 'LOT', 'bullets', 'film', 'darker', '50s', 'version', 'lot', 'less', 'comedy', 'more', 'obvious', 'commentary', 'police', 'propriety', 'British', 'society', 'whimsy', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'used', 'pawn', 'international', 'game', 'espionage', 'murder.Quite', 'story', 'Check', 'Hitchcock', 'Remake', 'Man', 'Who', 'Knew', 'Too', 'Much']",N/A
