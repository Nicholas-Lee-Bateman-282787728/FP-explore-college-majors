I am a big fan, and admire him for what he has created thus far. In respect to The House Of Pain, a family drama that never has a boring moment, presents another issue that today's world can not only relate to, but learn from. I look forward every week as to what issue they will focus on, and how they deal with it and resolve it. Miss. Ella is a gem, and all the other characters light up the TV screen. The sitcom is educational for parents, teachers, childcare workers, just about all viewers. The issues presented are about relationships; marriage; illness; faith; drugs; guns and much more. Each and every episode is uplifting, inspiring, and funny as well.
