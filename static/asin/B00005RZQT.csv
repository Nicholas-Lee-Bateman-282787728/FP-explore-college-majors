681080,A2F3SXHT6RBV81,B00005RZQT,"Betty Burks ""Betty  Burks""","[9, 11]","Quite unexpectedly, I was invited to watch this movie by two acquaintances who had read Clyde Edgerton's book which inspired this adaptation.  They knew what to expect.  I did not.  At first, I found it difficult to watch the scenes of the youth in detention, and thought the old lady was silly.This film was produced by an Independent studio with a far-out name to be viewed only in the U.S. and Canada; maybe other countries would not understand the coloquial dialogue.  Based in North Carolina, the accents were a little affected, but here in East Tennessee I am learning they speak their own type.  You have to hear it to believe it.  It's almost like a foreign language.The subject matter is as old as life itself.  Title of her favorite hymn and a saying she has when a stray dog enters her limited existence and she has no time to care for it.  Early on, a humorous occurrence changes her life when she gets stuck in her rocking chair while watching her favorite soap operas on television.  Thank goodness, she has called the animal control and the dogcatcher enters her house after he hears her calls for help when he comes to take the dog.  Mattie, played by Ellen Burstyn, is lonely because her children check on her intermittenly at their convenience, but she does have nosey neighbors who have to know every little thing going on.She's rescued by Lamar who has to break the chair to get her out as she is so tightly wedged in; in the process, his wallet slips out and, when he calls about it, she insists he come to get it at meal time.  He offers to repair the chair and she (nosey little thing) reads a letter which is sticking out of the wallet he left on the table.  He has a nephew in a lot of trouble.Sixteen-yr-od Wesley, played by Jonathan Taylor Thomas, is an orphan whose life is threatened in a pre-pen environment, a place she has no idea of the reality as she unknowingly ""adopts"" him as the grandson she's yearned for -- someone who needs her.  He was convinced she just had to be his grandmother, since he had no knowledge of his mother or family except for uncle Lamar.Her middle-aged, pompous son was too heavy for the ladder which comes apart in the middle and is left hanging from the gutter.  He discovers Wesley there doing chores and foolishly insists on doing the work himself.  The daughter wants to transplant her to a retirement home to be near people her own age.Her involvement in helping this young boy revives a life gone to seed.  Wesley couldn't get enough bubble baths, but was afraid of water when she took him fishing at the spot where her father had taken her in times past.  It was freakish how he learned to swim.  He is a product of his environment, and this film shows the harsh reality of life as it still is in certain situations.The ending is touching as she revives her strength and has a reason to live.  She's like a new person with a pride not just in her 'good cooking' skills but with a purpose, a destiny to help another human being she considers as 'the least of us' as interpreted by her Baptist preacher.  He needed to practice what he preaches, as does his interfering wife who looks like Namuni Young, who want to ostracize Mattie -- who shows them a thing or two.There were 'laugh-out-loud' parts of this movie, and some which may make you want to cry.  If you are feeling low or things just aren't working out, this book will revive your faith in humankind.",3,Life in the rural South with religious overtones.,1105920000,"01 17, 2005",2005,3426,"['Quite', 'unexpectedly', 'was', 'invited', 'watch', 'movie', 'two', 'acquaintances', 'who', 'had', 'read', 'Clyde', 'Edgerton', 'book', 'inspired', 'adaptation', 'knew', 'what', 'expect', 'did', 'not', 'first', 'found', 'difficult', 'watch', 'scenes', 'youth', 'detention', 'thought', 'old', 'lady', 'was', 'silly.This', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'Independent', 'studio', 'far-out', 'name', 'be', 'viewed', 'only', 'U.S.', 'Canada', 'maybe', 'other', 'countries', 'would', 'not', 'understand', 'coloquial', 'dialogue', 'Based', 'North', 'Carolina', 'accents', 'were', 'little', 'affected', 'here', 'East', 'Tennessee', 'am', 'learning', 'speak', 'own', 'type', 'have', 'hear', 'believe', 'almost', 'foreign', 'language.The', 'subject', 'matter', 'as', 'old', 'life', 'Title', 'favorite', 'hymn', 'saying', 'when', 'stray', 'dog', 'enters', 'limited', 'existence', 'time', 'care', 'Early', 'humorous', 'occurrence', 'changes', 'life', 'when', 'stuck', 'rocking', 'chair', 'watching', 'favorite', 'soap', 'operas', 'television', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'called', 'animal', 'control', 'dogcatcher', 'house', 'calls', 'help', 'when', 'take', 'dog', 'Mattie', 'played', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'lonely', 'children', 'check', 'intermittenly', 'convenience', 'have', 'nosey', 'neighbors', 'who', 'have', 'know', 'little', 'thing', 'going', 'rescued', 'Lamar', 'who', 'break', 'chair', 'get', 'out', 'so', 'tightly', 'wedged', 'process', 'wallet', 'out', 'when', 'come', 'get', 'meal', 'time', 'repair', 'chair', 'nosey', 'little', 'thing', 'letter', 'sticking', 'wallet', 'left', 'table', 'nephew', 'lot', 'trouble.Sixteen-yr-od', 'Wesley', 'played', 'Jonathan', 'Taylor', 'Thomas', 'orphan', 'life', 'threatened', 'pre-pen', 'environment', 'place', 'idea', 'reality', 'unknowingly', 'adopts', 'grandson', 'yearned', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'convinced', 'just', 'had', 'be', 'grandmother', 'had', 'knowledge', 'mother', 'family', 'uncle', 'Lamar.Her', 'middle-aged', 'pompous', 'son', 'was', 'too', 'heavy', 'ladder', 'apart', 'middle', 'left', 'hanging', 'gutter', 'Wesley', 'doing', 'chores', 'foolishly', 'insists', 'doing', 'work', 'daughter', 'transplant', 'retirement', 'home', 'be', 'near', 'people', 'own', 'age.Her', 'involvement', 'helping', 'young', 'boy', 'life', 'gone', 'seed', 'Wesley', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'bubble', 'baths', 'was', 'afraid', 'water', 'when', 'took', 'fishing', 'spot', 'where', 'father', 'had', 'taken', 'times', 'past', 'was', 'freakish', 'how', 'learned', 'swim', 'product', 'environment', 'film', 'harsh', 'reality', 'life', 'still', 'certain', 'situations.The', 'ending', 'touching', 'strength', 'reason', 'live', 'new', 'person', 'pride', 'not', 'just', ""'good"", 'cooking', 'skills', 'purpose', 'destiny', 'help', 'human', 'being', 'considers', ""'the"", 'least', 'interpreted', 'Baptist', 'preacher', 'needed', 'practice', 'what', 'interfering', 'wife', 'who', 'Namuni', 'Young', 'who', 'want', 'ostracize', 'Mattie', 'who', 'thing', 'were', ""'laugh-out-loud"", 'parts', 'movie', 'may', 'make', 'want', 'cry', 'are', 'feeling', 'low', 'things', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'working', 'out', 'book', 'will', 'revive', 'faith', 'humankind']",Walking Across Egypt

681082,A3P876I6K3KL8V,B00005RZQT,C. Long,"[1, 1]","How this movie has gone ""under the radar"" is beyond me.  This movie is my #1 choice for the ""surprisingly great movie that nobody seems to have ever seen or heard of"" category.  As a Christian, I enjoy movies that bolster my faith.  This one did that, though it is done in such a way that I believe you could not be a Christian and still very much enjoy this movie.This movie shows a ""simple"" elderly woman that heard what the Bible said about something (that her ""religious"" pastor preached on) and decided to take it at face value and actually put it into practice (imagine THAT!).  Later on, we even see the pastor that preached on it and fellow congregants get upset because she did so (which sadly doesn't seem too far from what might really happen at some churches).Besides the excellent message of putting your faith into practice by actively LOVING (and then seeing all the ""religious"" people getting up in arms about it!), the result of that love in helping to change old ways and ""break through"" to a hardened person is present, as is one of not just sitting around waiting to die as an elderly person.  This is GREAT stuff!Typically I very much dislike movies with cursing in them but I will make an exception for this movie. I still won't say that I liked it or agree with its inclusion, but it is generally within the context of the ""hardened"" boy - and we see the language improve as things go along. In some ways, it actually could be seriously argued that much of it adds to the story and helps deepen the impact of the message of the movie, which is something you can't say about 99% of the bad language in most movies. The bad language is mostly of the milder variety but you should know there are a few briefly uncomfortable scenes with sexual references. I was able to get by watching this movie without too much of a problem and I have grown quite ""sensitive"" to bad language over the years, so it's not a major detractor for me from this movie. In this case, the message of the movie outshadows any negative with the language (and as stated, the language could actually arguably be intertwined with the message).There's no sex or much anything else of note that would be concerning to someone that cares about such things.  But don't be fooled: Despite the inclusion of a teen as a central character, this really is NOT a family movie like you would think of a ""family movie"".  Personally I wouldn't recommend it for anyone under 16 and would recommend family discussion/follow-up if at all possible - there's some great messages in this movie worthy of discussion.  I could see it used in the context of church small groups, etc.And for non-Christians, this is still an enjoyable ""low key"" movie with a great story!  It is mostly a low-key drama with some ""unique"" comedy (though genuinely funny in certain places) and a smidge of action thrown in, so as long as you don't expect to laugh or be enthralled with action every 30 seconds, you'll probably like it just fine.Though this is a lower-budget type movie, the acting is pretty well-done and believable, and generally I have no complaints about the filming style or picture quality.  I hope some day this comes out on Blu-Ray, though I suspect I may be waiting for a very long time.Pick this movie up if you get a chance - I doubt you'll be sorry. :)Chris LongLaugh & Lift ministries",5,Excellent Movie That You've Probably Never Heard Of,1323475200,"12 10, 2011",2011,3361,"['How', 'movie', 'gone', 'radar', 'movie', '1', 'choice', 'surprisingly', 'great', 'movie', 'nobody', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'heard', 'category', 'Christian', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'bolster', 'faith', 'one', 'did', 'done', 'such', 'way', 'believe', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'Christian', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'enjoy', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'simple', 'elderly', 'woman', 'heard', 'what', 'Bible', 'said', 'something', 'religious', 'pastor', 'preached', 'decided', 'take', 'face', 'value', 'actually', 'put', 'practice', 'imagine', 'Later', 'even', 'see', 'pastor', 'preached', 'fellow', 'congregants', 'get', 'upset', 'did', 'so', 'sadly', ""n't"", 'seem', 'too', 'far', 'what', 'might', 'really', 'happen', 'churches', 'excellent', 'message', 'putting', 'faith', 'practice', 'actively', 'LOVING', 'then', 'seeing', 'religious', 'people', 'getting', 'up', 'arms', 'result', 'love', 'helping', 'change', 'old', 'ways', 'break', 'hardened', 'person', 'present', 'one', 'not', 'just', 'sitting', 'around', 'waiting', 'die', 'elderly', 'person', 'GREAT', 'stuff', 'Typically', 'very', 'much', 'movies', 'cursing', 'will', 'make', 'exception', 'movie', 'still', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'liked', 'agree', 'inclusion', 'generally', 'context', 'hardened', 'boy', 'see', 'language', 'improve', 'things', 'go', 'along', 'ways', 'actually', 'could', 'be', 'seriously', 'argued', 'much', 'story', 'deepen', 'impact', 'message', 'movie', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', '99', '%', 'bad', 'language', 'most', 'movies', 'bad', 'language', 'mostly', 'milder', 'variety', 'should', 'know', 'are', 'few', 'briefly', 'uncomfortable', 'scenes', 'sexual', 'references', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'watching', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'problem', 'have', 'grown', 'quite', 'sensitive', 'bad', 'language', 'years', 'not', 'major', 'detractor', 'movie', 'case', 'message', 'movie', 'negative', 'language', 'as', 'stated', 'language', 'could', 'actually', 'arguably', 'be', 'intertwined', 'message', 'sex', 'much', 'anything', 'else', 'note', 'would', 'be', 'concerning', 'someone', 'such', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'inclusion', 'teen', 'central', 'character', 'really', 'NOT', 'family', 'movie', 'would', 'think', 'family', 'movie', 'Personally', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', '16', 'would', 'recommend', 'family', 'discussion/follow-up', 'possible', 'great', 'messages', 'movie', 'worthy', 'discussion', 'could', 'see', 'used', 'context', 'church', 'small', 'groups', 'etc.And', 'non-Christians', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'low', 'key', 'movie', 'great', 'story', 'mostly', 'low-key', 'drama', 'unique', 'comedy', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'certain', 'places', 'smidge', 'action', 'thrown', 'so', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'laugh', 'be', 'enthralled', 'action', '30', 'seconds', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'just', 'lower-budget', 'type', 'movie', 'acting', 'pretty', 'well-done', 'believable', 'generally', 'have', 'complaints', 'filming', 'style', 'picture', 'quality', 'hope', 'day', 'out', 'Blu-Ray', 'suspect', 'may', 'be', 'waiting', 'very', 'long', 'time.Pick', 'movie', 'up', 'get', 'chance', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sorry', 'Chris', 'LongLaugh', 'Lift', 'ministries']",Walking Across Egypt

681090,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B00005RZQT,Michael Butts,"[52, 52]","Once in a while a movie comes along that is so refreshingly poignant it makes an impression.  WALKING ACROSS EGYPT is one of those quiet little gems that are hard to come by.Ellen Burstyn has one of her best roles in years as Maddie Rigsby, an elderly woman who putters around her house and even though she manages to get stuck in her easy chair when the cushion collapses, she's still pretty durable.  After a sermon at her local church regarding do unto others, Maddie takes it on herself to visit the young nephew of the local animal control man, and takes him her pound cake and iced tea.  Wesley is a hard-nosed, cynical young man, who has gone from orphanage to foster home to the juvenile detention center for stealing a car.  Wesley asks Maddie if she is his grandmother, giving us our first inkling into what Wesley has missed in his life.  When he and another fellow inmate escape after tangling with the musclebound Johnny, Wesley sees Maddie as an easy mark and charms his way into a place to stay for a few days and to steal money so he can go off to Florida.  Maddie also has a grown son, who is in his late thirties without any romantic involvements, and a daughter who thinks Maddie should opt for a retirement home.  It isn't long before Maddie and Wesley develop a strong relationship:  she throws him in the river to make him learn to swim; takes him fishing; treats him special.What makes the movie work so well is Burstyn's believably real performance; she doesn't try and act like a former Oscar winner; she's tough, touching and ultimately heartwarming.  Jonathan Taylor Thomas scores big as Wesley, his pumped up bravado swiftly replaced by a sense of wonder as he discovers things he's missed; Mark Hamill is fine as Wesley's uncle, the animal catcher who marvels at the changes in his young nephew; Judge Reinhold and Gail O'Grady are effective as Maddie's children, he a little more accessible than O'Grady's cool aloofness.  Harve Presnell and the late Gwen Verdon are funny as Maddie's dotty neighbors and Pat Corley offers a fine sheriff.WALKING ACROSS EGYPT is a quiet, yet majestic film that tugs at the heart and its ending which seems to be heading to tragedy has a redemptive and satifying conclusion.",5,A REFRESHING CINEMATIC WALK,1138665600,"01 31, 2006",2006,2236,"['Once', 'while', 'movie', 'so', 'refreshingly', 'poignant', 'impression', 'ACROSS', 'EGYPT', 'one', 'quiet', 'little', 'gems', 'are', 'hard', 'come', 'by.Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'years', 'Maddie', 'Rigsby', 'elderly', 'woman', 'who', 'house', 'even', 'get', 'stuck', 'easy', 'chair', 'when', 'cushion', 'still', 'pretty', 'durable', 'sermon', 'local', 'church', 'regarding', 'do', 'unto', 'others', 'Maddie', 'visit', 'young', 'nephew', 'local', 'animal', 'control', 'man', 'pound', 'cake', 'iced', 'tea', 'Wesley', 'hard-nosed', 'cynical', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'gone', 'orphanage', 'foster', 'home', 'juvenile', 'detention', 'center', 'stealing', 'car', 'Wesley', 'Maddie', 'grandmother', 'giving', 'first', 'inkling', 'what', 'Wesley', 'missed', 'life', 'When', 'fellow', 'inmate', 'escape', 'tangling', 'musclebound', 'Johnny', 'Wesley', 'Maddie', 'easy', 'mark', 'charms', 'way', 'place', 'stay', 'few', 'days', 'steal', 'money', 'can', 'go', 'off', 'Florida', 'Maddie', 'also', 'grown', 'son', 'who', 'late', 'thirties', 'romantic', 'involvements', 'daughter', 'who', 'Maddie', 'should', 'opt', 'retirement', 'home', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'Maddie', 'Wesley', 'develop', 'strong', 'relationship', 'river', 'make', 'learn', 'swim', 'fishing', 'movie', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'Burstyn', 'believably', 'real', 'performance', ""n't"", 'try', 'act', 'former', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'tough', 'touching', 'ultimately', 'heartwarming', 'Jonathan', 'Taylor', 'Thomas', 'big', 'Wesley', 'pumped', 'up', 'bravado', 'swiftly', 'replaced', 'sense', 'wonder', 'things', 'missed', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'fine', 'Wesley', 'uncle', 'animal', 'catcher', 'who', 'changes', 'young', 'nephew', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'Gail', ""O'Grady"", 'are', 'effective', 'Maddie', 'children', 'little', 'more', 'accessible', ""O'Grady"", 'cool', 'aloofness', 'Harve', 'Presnell', 'late', 'Gwen', 'Verdon', 'are', 'funny', 'Maddie', 'dotty', 'neighbors', 'Pat', 'Corley', 'fine', 'sheriff.WALKING', 'ACROSS', 'EGYPT', 'quiet', 'yet', 'majestic', 'film', 'heart', 'ending', 'be', 'heading', 'tragedy', 'redemptive', 'satifying', 'conclusion']",Walking Across Egypt
