1226014,A9KAY47NCPQS,B001P8M9FU,"Beatrice Izzey ""Nanny Dog""","[14, 15]","It's a documentary, but almost all of the characters are laughable shells of human beings.  It's an anthropological study, a highly entertaining, hilarious one.It's all surface agitation.  Little introspection.  No wisdom.  Just yuppies doing what they see their peers doing.  Monkey see monkey do.  No critical ability.  Ants and rats, going to and fro.Lots of the people featured are first generation largely white newcomers to Manhattan/NYC, and seem unaware that they to an extent chose to enter a highly insular, regimented social milieu with its own arbitrary rules.  They do not recognize that there are million other legitimate ways to live and educate children.All the parents are reading the one book in print re nursery schools in NYC (by Victoria Goldman) and none of them seem to have thought that there are hundreds of perfectly good schools in other neighborhoods but are completely omitted from this book.Rent it on Netflix; no need to buy.  You won't want to watch it again.  It's not artsy or timeless.  It's more like social farce lite.",3,view it as an unintended comedy of errors,1296777600,"02 4, 2011",2011,1055,"['documentary', 'almost', 'characters', 'are', 'laughable', 'shells', 'human', 'beings', 'anthropological', 'study', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'hilarious', 'one.It', 'surface', 'agitation', 'Little', 'introspection', 'wisdom', 'Just', 'yuppies', 'doing', 'what', 'see', 'peers', 'doing', 'Monkey', 'see', 'monkey', 'do', 'No', 'critical', 'ability', 'Ants', 'rats', 'going', 'fro.Lots', 'people', 'featured', 'are', 'first', 'generation', 'largely', 'white', 'newcomers', 'Manhattan/NYC', 'seem', 'unaware', 'extent', 'chose', 'enter', 'highly', 'insular', 'regimented', 'social', 'milieu', 'own', 'arbitrary', 'rules', 'do', 'not', 'recognize', 'are', 'million', 'other', 'legitimate', 'ways', 'live', 'educate', 'children.All', 'parents', 'are', 'reading', 'one', 'book', 'print', 're', 'nursery', 'schools', 'NYC', 'Victoria', 'Goldman', 'none', 'seem', 'have', 'thought', 'are', 'hundreds', 'perfectly', 'good', 'schools', 'other', 'neighborhoods', 'are', 'completely', 'omitted', 'book.Rent', 'Netflix', 'need', 'buy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'not', 'artsy', 'timeless', 'more', 'social', 'farce', 'lite']",Nursery University

This is like Sex and the City Married with Children because the adults are doing things that make no sense to the rest of us, spending too much money to do it and why the heck are they living in Manhattan, anyway?  The film is like watching a really weird three-legged, potato sack, egg in a spoon relay race that is going on only in the MINDS of the participants.

Of course all the stories are human and touching, but at almost every turn the viewer is jolted into a more realistic perspective as the parents lose theirs (you could argue they never had any to begin with). One almost feels a bit sorry for these parents who single-mindedly believe or want to believe in the ""feeder school"" system and that preschool is the beginning of a chain reaction that leads to proper university and success in life.

1226019,A2TV8IBV3ZVV2V,B001P8M9FU,Melissa,"[0, 0]","I was absolutely amazed at what these parents had to maneuver just to get their kids into a 'good' preschool program.  What these parents have to go through borders on the insanely absurd. Having said that, I liked that  the documentary followed a very diverse group of parents and children. From the higher end two income parents who can afford the best to the lower end working class parents who have to find scholarships in order to obtain the best. Two parent households, single parent households and a range of very young parents to the more mature parents in their 40's and 50's.I also liked that the preschoolers were at different levels of development and maturity, some obviously very gifted to others who were very much 'normal' and then those who seemed to possibly have learning disorders.

Especially Juliana's dad, he seems kooky about the whole application process. This is preschool and they are 3 year olds! I don't think not getting into a $15,000-$20,000 per semester nursery school will ruin anyone's chances of getting accepted into an Ivy years later. Alot of things can happen in the intervening years. I understand the competition due to the limited number of spots and high number of applicants, but really I think some of these parents are losing sight of what's important.
