1205536,A1KRPOQQ8LQK0R,B001JAHPJ4,"Betty L. Detwiler ""bookie""","[5, 5]","Just finished viewing Season 2 of Benson - my only complaint is that there was no menu included listing the episodes on each disc.  Not having seen all the episodes when they were on television, I cannot make any comment regarding whether or not some of the episodes were out of order and if any were from season three.  I enjoyed each and every episode from season two.  Televison writers today need to learn from the writers of the eighties. You can have quality entertainment that isn't sprinkled with violence, excessive profanity, bathroom humor or sexual situations.  I found the episode where Benson pretends to be the governor when Gretchen's best friend comes to call to be espcially entertaining. Plus, the lessons that can be learned are priceless. Benson speaks his mind without being condescending to others. Also, seeing Ted Danson and Dana Elcar in their roles added to the programs.  If any more seasons of Benson are to be produced, I would definitely purchase them.",5,laugh a minute,1336780800,"05 12, 2012",2012,983,"['Just', 'finished', 'viewing', 'Season', '2', 'Benson', 'only', 'complaint', 'was', 'menu', 'included', 'listing', 'episodes', 'disc', 'Not', 'having', 'seen', 'episodes', 'when', 'were', 'television', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'comment', 'regarding', 'not', 'episodes', 'were', 'out', 'order', 'were', 'season', 'three', 'enjoyed', 'episode', 'season', 'two', 'Televison', 'writers', 'today', 'need', 'learn', 'writers', 'eighties', 'can', 'have', 'quality', 'entertainment', ""n't"", 'sprinkled', 'violence', 'excessive', 'profanity', 'bathroom', 'humor', 'sexual', 'situations', 'found', 'episode', 'where', 'Benson', 'be', 'governor', 'when', 'Gretchen', 'best', 'friend', 'call', 'be', 'espcially', 'entertaining', 'lessons', 'can', 'be', 'learned', 'are', 'priceless', 'Benson', 'mind', 'being', 'condescending', 'others', 'Also', 'seeing', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'Dana', 'Elcar', 'roles', 'added', 'programs', 'more', 'seasons', 'Benson', 'are', 'be', 'produced', 'would', 'definitely', 'purchase']",Benson: Season 2

1205538,A3CWRKJTB2SEQS,B001JAHPJ4,Careful Reviewer,"[1, 1]","I bought three different titles of these manufactured-on-demand (MOD) products: ""The Gallant Men"", ""Benson"" (season 2) and ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father"" (season 1). All sets have been burned on DVD-R's just as you would burn a CD or DVD on your computer. Who knows what the quality of the DVD R disk is?What you get are a set of disks that may or may not play on your DVD player. A couple of disks in each set may play on some players, but I struggled to find a complete set that would play on both of my players. I had to return these sets several times to collect disks that would play.Essentially, the studio is so paranoid about copy protection that they won't let these be played on many players. The interesting thing is that I had no trouble creating back-up copies!! In other words; they have succeeded in frustrating people that want to play what they bought, but can't prevent people from copying! I backed-up all of these sets onto my own DVD's and can now watch them on both of my players.",3,Good Show - Questionable DVD Quality,1362528000,"03 6, 2013",2013,1005,"['bought', 'three', 'different', 'titles', 'manufactured-on-demand', 'MOD', 'products', 'Gallant', 'Men', 'Benson', 'season', '2', 'Courtship', 'Eddie', 'Father', 'season', '1', 'sets', 'have', 'been', 'burned', 'DVD-R', 'just', 'would', 'burn', 'CD', 'DVD', 'computer', 'Who', 'what', 'quality', 'DVD', 'R', 'disk', 'What', 'get', 'are', 'set', 'disks', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'play', 'DVD', 'player', 'couple', 'disks', 'set', 'may', 'play', 'players', 'struggled', 'find', 'complete', 'set', 'would', 'play', 'players', 'had', 'return', 'sets', 'several', 'times', 'collect', 'disks', 'would', 'play.Essentially', 'studio', 'so', 'paranoid', 'copy', 'protection', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'be', 'played', 'many', 'players', 'interesting', 'thing', 'had', 'trouble', 'creating', 'back-up', 'copies', 'other', 'words', 'have', 'succeeded', 'frustrating', 'people', 'want', 'play', 'what', 'bought', 'ca', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'people', 'copying', 'backed-up', 'sets', 'own', 'DVD', 'can', 'now', 'watch', 'players']",Benson: Season 2

It bought this set and not a single disc played on my player. At first I thought it probably go mishandled in shipping and then I thought about the probablity of 3 discs being damaged and the unlikeliness of that. I did some research and found out that many are complaining about the set. The problem is that this is a manufacture on demand dvd set burned on dvd - r which is unheard of for official releases. The type of discs they used is the sole reason that the dvds don't play. I would also like to take a minute to discuss the packaging. The packaging looked like something that you would buy from some bootlegger on the steet because the artwork looks like it was printed on plain printer paper and folded up to look professional. When I recieved this set for Christmas, I immediately asked where did the person buy it from because it looked odd for an official release like the person bought it from someone on one of the many bootleg websites on the internet. They should not charge so much for a set that was not well thought out like this one. Not a very happy customer. I love Amazon and do not fault them for the mistake this DVD company made.
