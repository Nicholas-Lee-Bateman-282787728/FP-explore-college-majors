Cecil,"[24, 26]","Received a free copy of Escape with C Thomas Howell and John Rhys-Davies.first here is what the distributers had to say:Doctors Paul and Kim Jordan are struggling to find peace in their lives after the tragic loss of their baby's life. Paul (C. Thomas Howell from The Amazing Spider Man, ET) persuades Kim to escape reality and flee to the exquisite islands of Southeast Asia. Paradise becomes a nightmare when he is kidnapped by human traffickers in need of a skilled doctor.Faced with a fight for survival, Paul finds himself captive alongside the wealthy Malcolm Andrews (John Rhys-Davies from Indiana Jones, Lord of the Rings). He quickly realizes there is no hope for his captors dying leader and is forced to examine his eternal fate. With life and death in the balance, Malcolm challenges Paul to stop running from God. Will Paul realize that trust in God is his only hope for escape and reunion with his wife?Pure Flix has had many films over the past few years from Brother White to Encounter to Jerusalem Countdown and many more.this film was another step up in every area.First thing that caught my eye was the great photography. This movies production value took a giant leap in quality.Second was the actors. From a LOTR actor in John Rhys-Davies to Pony Boy Curtis from the outsiders tthe films actors did a great job.Finally the script was very solidly written as well.Our main characters find themselves after a tragic loss leaving everything they have to do doctor work in the villages of Thailand.One day a young boy comes to the clinic and Howell follows him to a so called emergency.  He soon finds himself kidnapped to help some local pirates.The story carreans from there into a suspensefil drama that is not the norm in Christian cinema.Be sure to pick up a copy and help support GOOD christian Films!",4,Christian Suspense that is really GOOD!,1344297600,"08 7, 2012",2012,1824,"['Received', 'free', 'copy', 'Escape', 'C', 'Thomas', 'Howell', 'John', 'Rhys-Davies.first', 'here', 'what', 'distributers', 'had', 'say', 'Doctors', 'Paul', 'Kim', 'Jordan', 'are', 'struggling', 'find', 'peace', 'lives', 'tragic', 'loss', 'baby', 'life', 'Paul', 'C.', 'Thomas', 'Howell', 'Amazing', 'Spider', 'Man', 'ET', 'Kim', 'escape', 'reality', 'flee', 'exquisite', 'islands', 'Southeast', 'Asia', 'Paradise', 'nightmare', 'when', 'kidnapped', 'human', 'traffickers', 'need', 'skilled', 'doctor.Faced', 'fight', 'survival', 'Paul', 'captive', 'wealthy', 'Malcolm', 'Andrews', 'John', 'Rhys-Davies', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'quickly', 'realizes', 'hope', 'captors', 'dying', 'leader', 'forced', 'examine', 'eternal', 'fate', 'life', 'death', 'balance', 'Malcolm', 'Paul', 'stop', 'running', 'God', 'Will', 'Paul', 'realize', 'trust', 'God', 'only', 'hope', 'escape', 'reunion', 'wife', 'Pure', 'Flix', 'had', 'many', 'films', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'Brother', 'White', 'Encounter', 'Jerusalem', 'Countdown', 'many', 'more.this', 'film', 'was', 'step', 'up', 'area.First', 'thing', 'caught', 'eye', 'was', 'great', 'photography', 'movies', 'production', 'value', 'took', 'giant', 'leap', 'quality.Second', 'was', 'actors', 'LOTR', 'actor', 'John', 'Rhys-Davies', 'Pony', 'Boy', 'Curtis', 'outsiders', 'tthe', 'films', 'actors', 'did', 'great', 'job.Finally', 'script', 'was', 'very', 'solidly', 'written', 'well.Our', 'main', 'characters', 'find', 'tragic', 'loss', 'leaving', 'everything', 'have', 'do', 'doctor', 'work', 'villages', 'Thailand.One', 'day', 'young', 'boy', 'clinic', 'Howell', 'so', 'called', 'emergency', 'soon', 'kidnapped', 'help', 'local', 'pirates.The', 'story', 'carreans', 'suspensefil', 'drama', 'not', 'norm', 'Christian', 'cinema.Be', 'sure', 'pick', 'up', 'copy', 'help', 'support', 'GOOD', 'christian', 'Films']",N/A

1536068,A1VOPP2OFITP7D,B007Q0JJIQ,June Bug,"[0, 1]","I found this movie to be very creative in using a plausible scenario to convey many Biblical truths.On another site, many reviewers are highly critical of the acting by Jean Rhys-Davies.  His part came across as tremendously overacted, I agree.  I think that C. Thomas Howell definitely could have done better as well; but I suspect that may have been a result of a directorial or even poor screenwriting could be the underlying issue rather than poor acting.  Most of the other actors didn't come across well either especially the woman, who plays Rhys-Davies wife.  Some of the dialogue seemed a bit flat or plain unlikely given the situations the characters are in.The point of the story was meaningful as through the dialogue several points were conveyed.  1) God knows it is an ugly world and our free will is in part some of the reason, why some bad things happen;  2) God knows our thoughts and emotions, so if we are angry suppressing it doesn't change anything; 3) God's ways are not our ways; 4) We can ask him to help us get through or do it ourselves; 5) The plan of salvation is simple and easy to do - confess your sins, accept Christ's work on the cross and ask God to take control.The movie definitely had drama and suspense, you have no idea how the movie will end, which I think given the other flaws, these qualities make it a must see.Its a pretty decent evangelism movie for 90 minutes for those who heard the message but didn't have a context for it.
