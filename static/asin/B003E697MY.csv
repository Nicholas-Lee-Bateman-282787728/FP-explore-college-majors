It's so bad it's GREAT, on par withForbidden Choices [VHS],Boy Who Loved Trolls [VHS] andThe Seventh Coin. It's about a forbidden romance between a monk and a married woman... so think of it is a budget equivalent toThorn Birdswith the constant narration of Kim Basinger. ""The Mermaid Chair"" is a romance written by Sue Monk Kidd, whose memoirThe Dance of the Dissident Daughter: A Woman's Journey from Christian Tradition to the Sacred Feminine (Plus)is a fascinating exploration of growing up in evangelical, fundamentalist Christianity and discovering the Goddess. Kidd's attempt at romance... makes for fun. It's intended to be taken seriously, but it's got too many corkers, like ""It's in a mayonnaise jar"" (when a family friend talks about finding the heroine's mother's finger) ""embrace the test, not the woman"" (the bland advice the monk receives after declaring his love), ""it's hard talking to an 18 year old about traveling and solitude of being"" (when the heroine&her; husband separate). There's the ""I didn't fall from grace... I dove!"" LikeThe Bridges of Madison County, the woman's unfaithfulness is a catalyst for spiritual&sexual; awakening. Basinger's character begins painting again.""The Mermaid Chair"" is a stew of various kinds of spirituality. There are Catholic monks. It seems to be set in Canada. There are European medieval saints, mermaids&sirens;, the Native American sea goddess Sedna, along with the African family friend who's frequently drumming. The syncretism is like the mix of science fiction&fantasy; inKrull (Special Edition). Bruce Greenwood stars as Basinger's hunky and boring psychologist husband. Alex Carter stars as a not-so-virginal monk who lost his pregnant wife in a tragic accident. The affair seems to be spurred on by both characters. Br. Thomas (Carter) invites Jesse (Basinger) to come boating with him... alone. He takes initiative in inviting her to be with him, far from his brother monks. Jesse drops by the monastery, showing off her cleavage. Towards the end, Br. Thomas has misgivings... and Jesse has to wrestle with regret.""The Mermaid Chair"" is so bad... it's GREAT. It's a Lifetime romance movie.

It stars Kim Basinger as Jessie who is struggling in her twenty-year marriage to her husband played by Bruce Greenwood and needs time away when she runs to help her mother who has a quirk for slicing off her fingers on occasion. While on the island she grew up, she finds herself in a mutual attraction with a Benedictine monk, Brother Thomas played by Alex Carter.In this Lifetime movie, the strong woman feels herself chained down by the limits her marriage has put upon her and she longs to have the spirit of a free mermaid apparently. Her husband is a psychiatrist and places valid calls to her on the island to assess her mother's mental status since she's been cutting off fingers and Jessie immediately is turned off by this so-called controlling behavior he is exhibiting. Something about meeting this monk and his skills in net-weaving, boating, and fishing just really gets her going far enough to place her marriage in jeopardy.Typically, Jessie has a network of female friends on the island to support her and her mother in this time of crisis including a kooky African woman, a Mermaid tourist attraction shop owner, and her mentally handicapped daughter who can read dogs' minds. They share spiritual stories about mermaids, turtle skulls, and dancing around fires as ways of bringing themselves luck but all it seems to do is motivate Jessie's mother to do some more finger amputation and bury them in the garden as penance for something she won't reveal to anyone.Kim Basinger has a series of voiceovers throughout that fill in mermaid legend stories well, but don't add much else and get annoying. Her flip-flopping back and forth between her thoughtful, too caring and concerned husband and this sweet ex-lawyer man beginning to doubt taking his vows of faith as a monk solely based on her behavior gets ridiculous. Finally it turns out the point of the story had nothing to do with either romance, but with her mother's past.Situations like this make me ask what is the point, but those Lifetime movies gotta have their romance regardless if it matters in the plot and seeing as how each of them is based on a novel, you can bet it's a romance novel of some sort.
