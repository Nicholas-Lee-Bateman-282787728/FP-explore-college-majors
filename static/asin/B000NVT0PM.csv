It's amazing that as fans one can offer feedback and in return receive such merchandise of this caliber.The DVD is chalk-full of delightful extras to expand upon the experience of Haruhi's universe. The extras beyond the DVD are well received: the music CD, the iron-on design, and pencil board are something to display. Sadly, the hair band was rather small. The special edition box itself is well-designed with the opening flaps and the hidden magnet to close it shut.

As we watch, and listen, from Kyon's point of view, Haruhi appears in school and starts her own club, dragging in apparently innocent members into the SOS Brigade as she searches for X-Files level oddities in her own world...Of course, she cannot see the forest for the trees; as her club grows, each member reveals him/herself to Kyon, who sees Kyon as a Key of some sort.  There is an esper, a time traveller, and a alien, all there to watch Haruhi, who did something three years ago that has troubled different organizations, so they are researching her.  What does Kyon have to do with any of this?  Simply because he is the only normal human that Haruhi has paid any attention to.A must-watch, with giggles and a bit of fan-service (no nudity, just panty shots) and a lot of odd-ball entertainment.Definitely far, far above the caliber of Excel Saga, so don't expect that level of insanity.",5,Delightfully odd,1184025600,"07 10, 2007",2007,1075,"['first', 'disc', 'series', 'up', 'characters', 'even', 'episode', '00', 'Haruhi', 'insane', 'little', 'anime-style', 'movie', 'commented', 'constantly', 'Kyon', 'cynic', 'watch', 'listen', 'Kyon', 'point', 'view', 'Haruhi', 'school', 'own', 'club', 'dragging', 'apparently', 'innocent', 'members', 'SOS', 'Brigade', 'X-Files', 'level', 'oddities', 'own', 'world', 'course', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'forest', 'trees', 'club', 'grows', 'member', 'Kyon', 'who', 'Kyon', 'Key', 'sort', 'esper', 'time', 'traveller', 'alien', 'there', 'watch', 'Haruhi', 'who', 'did', 'something', 'three', 'years', 'ago', 'troubled', 'different', 'organizations', 'are', 'researching', 'What', 'Kyon', 'have', 'do', 'Simply', 'only', 'normal', 'human', 'Haruhi', 'paid', 'attention', 'must-watch', 'giggles', 'bit', 'fan-service', 'nudity', 'just', 'panty', 'shots', 'lot', 'odd-ball', 'entertainment.Definitely', 'far', 'far', 'caliber', 'Excel', 'Saga', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'level', 'insanity']",The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya: Volume 1

I'll give just about any anime series that has some substance to it a shot.  With this one at first watching episode 00, it made me want to just lose all control and just freak out. I am sure that it was well thought out but after watching that.  I just wanted to move on and try to get the story advanced somewhat.  It does that in episode 1 enought to get me slightly interested and the 2nd episode was cool as well.  Episode 3 however didnt really do anything for me at all, it was just kind of a seen it and want to move on episode.It's something that's a little different.  I didnt care for Haruhi forcing the other member into wearing a bunny costume.  Why not just go out and hand out fliers like everyone else instead of dressing up like an extra from the Pussycat Dolls.  I know the girl is one screw loose from being sent to the funny farm for life.Sometimes i thought she was cool and others.  I wanted to kick her in the head for being some freakin annoying and bossy.  Its crazy that the other members of the ""SOS Brigade"" put up with her.  I know she's important for various reasons, but come on anyone ever hear of the word NO.  There's some comedy and fun parts to this first volume.I just hope the 2nd Volume kicks it up a notch for me, some action maybe.  I know everyone won't agree on this and thats okay.  I just wanted to get this out there.

1061012,A3LIWTQDSQ5UOO,B000NVT0PM,"Jonathan Oyama ""Welcome to die!""","[0, 1]","While not all popular shows are great, ""The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya"" goes beyond my expectations. The story focuses on Kyon and his adventures with Haruhi Suzumiya, a girl in his homeroom high school class. The two become good friends at first, but Kyon eventually regrets becoming friends after Haruhi pushes him into starting a club for Haruhi, named the S.O.S. Brigade. Leader Suzumiya formed the group to find aliens, espers and time travelers and play with them.Although the concept seems childish, the aliens, espers and time travelers are ironically right under Haruhi's nose. The dialogue takes a fascinating turn into science-fiction as S.O.S. Brigade's members Yuki, Mikuru and Itsuki explain their purpose in joining Haruhi in her exploits. Yuki is an alien, Mukuru is a time traveler and Itsuki is an esper (psychic), and Haruhi may be a god.This is a silly comedy that will entertain anyone, as long as they're willing to accept some fan service (partial nudity) from the characters. Haruhi's abuse of Mikuru as the moe (cute girl) fantasy of guys is hilarious in a naughty way. Haruhi strips her and dresses her up in bunny costumes and blackmail the computer club president to get equipment. It's a little cruel, but the abuse actually become more hilarious as the series continues.I like the dialogue in this series. The characters make it very memorable, and their science fiction dialogue makes the series sound so cool and intelligent in an absurd way. Their science fiction origins also makes for great side stories, especially with Yuki, the alien who lives alone and wants a friend. Just be prepared for the unexpected violence in episode 5 on the next DVD.",5,A popular show that goes beyond the hype,1183334400,"07 2, 2007",2007,1685,"['not', 'popular', 'shows', 'are', 'great', 'Melancholy', 'Haruhi', 'Suzumiya', 'expectations', 'story', 'Kyon', 'adventures', 'Haruhi', 'Suzumiya', 'girl', 'homeroom', 'high', 'school', 'class', 'two', 'become', 'good', 'friends', 'first', 'Kyon', 'eventually', 'becoming', 'friends', 'Haruhi', 'starting', 'club', 'Haruhi', 'named', 'S.O.S', 'Brigade', 'Leader', 'Suzumiya', 'formed', 'group', 'find', 'aliens', 'espers', 'time', 'travelers', 'play', 'concept', 'childish', 'aliens', 'espers', 'time', 'travelers', 'are', 'ironically', 'right', 'Haruhi', 'nose', 'dialogue', 'fascinating', 'turn', 'science-fiction', 'S.O.S', 'Brigade', 'members', 'Yuki', 'Mikuru', 'Itsuki', 'explain', 'purpose', 'joining', 'Haruhi', 'exploits', 'Yuki', 'alien', 'Mukuru', 'time', 'traveler', 'Itsuki', 'esper', 'psychic', 'Haruhi', 'may', 'be', 'god.This', 'silly', 'comedy', 'will', 'entertain', 'anyone', 'as', 'long', ""'re"", 'willing', 'accept', 'fan', 'service', 'partial', 'nudity', 'characters', 'Haruhi', 'abuse', 'Mikuru', 'moe', 'cute', 'girl', 'fantasy', 'guys', 'hilarious', 'naughty', 'way', 'Haruhi', 'up', 'bunny', 'costumes', 'blackmail', 'computer', 'club', 'president', 'get', 'equipment', 'little', 'cruel', 'abuse', 'actually', 'become', 'more', 'hilarious', 'series', 'continues.I', 'dialogue', 'series', 'characters', 'make', 'very', 'memorable', 'science', 'fiction', 'dialogue', 'series', 'sound', 'cool', 'intelligent', 'absurd', 'way', 'science', 'fiction', 'origins', 'also', 'great', 'side', 'stories', 'especially', 'Yuki', 'alien', 'who', 'alone', 'friend', 'Just', 'be', 'prepared', 'unexpected', 'violence', 'episode', '5', 'next', 'DVD']",The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya: Volume 1
1061013,A1UU6ETAY6TBRH,B000NVT0PM,Porcupine,"[7, 17]","For once, I agree that a ""popular"" show is good. Probably a lot of the people who like this show like it for different reasons than I, although I'm sure there are also people who like it for the same reasons I do.The best thing about this show is the animation. Kyoto Animation is by far the highest quality animation studio currently in existence in Japan. They haven't done many things yet though, so there's no need to go looking for all things they've done. I think the only other released show they've done with animation quality at this level is Full Metal Panic:2nd Raid and Fumoffu (not the 1st season). Before that they mostly did Inuyasha which was a super long TV series so the animation can't be as high-quality.The story seems kind of interesting, and is deeper than most might realize. However the comedy elements aren't as funny to me as they are to other people. I don't really find this show funny at all, and I wasn't impressed with Episode ""00"". I strongly recommend watching Episodes 1-3 first. Unfortunately that's not what I did, and I think my enjoyment of this series might be forever tarnished by that. The idea behind Episode 00 was good but I don't think it was done well enough, it wasn't as funny as it should have been.To me, the main reason to watch this show is to watch a funny-looking girl constantly make strange motions with her body in ultra high-quality animation. I don't think Haruhi is a funny person. It is just her appearance that is funny. Even though the story is interesting, I don't get into it very much. I mostly end up watching the funny-looking girl make her strange motions. Fortunately, to me that is enough to give a show a 5-star rating, since drawing quality, style, and animation quality are my primary criteria for good anime.Directing: 4 of 5 stars. Much better than I expected after seeing the Haruhi trailer on the FMP:2nd Raid DVD.Story: 4 of 5 stars. This show comes from Japanese novels originally. I think a lot of thought was put into engineering the Haruhi character and the premise behind this show. But most of the time I forget about the story. Haruhi's actions make me forget.Drawing Style: 5 of 5 stars. Noizi Ito style, which is excellent. Melancholy of Haruhi is more faithful to the original Noizi Ito style than Shakugan no Shana (the other major anime drawn in this style) is, but both shows have excellent drawings.Drawing Quality: 5 of 5 stars. So far, anyway. I can see a little bit of variance from episode to episode but not too much.Animation Quality: 5+ of 5 stars. Possibly the best animation I've ever seen, definitely in top 3. Only rivals: FMP:2nd Raid also by this studio, and Godannar!! a robot fighting anime (which is generally underappreciated by anime ""fans""....oh well).Music: 3 of 5 stars. It is not terrific but sufficient. It's not a hindrance. A lot of people seem to think the music is awesome, but I don't agree. I think people get blinded by the awesome animations in the opening and ending sequences, and think the songs are awesome too, but the songs alone are only okay songs.Now for a review of the DVD itself. Despite being released through Bandai Entertainment, this DVD is essentially like a Geneon DVD. The dubbing studio and VAs are what Geneon usually employs. The DVD authoring studio is what Geneon usually employs. Therefore the quality of the video, menus, and the appearance of the subtitles is identical to Geneon stuff. There's nothing Bandai about this release except for the name stamped on the cover. There are more extras than normal for a Geneon release though. Technically Kadokawa USA (a new company, I think) licensed this show...therefore it's packed with live-action (ohno) extras just like their other releases (FMP:2nd Raid).But about the extras, I have some issues with the inclusion of the ""USA fan-made"" live-action videos in this. I recommend they not be watched. There are some good things in them, but also some bad things. The ""fan"" extras make multiple statements which indirectly advocate the common practice of fansubbing. There are some good things about fansubbing, but there are bad things also. In the end, people should know that fansubbing in any form is technically illegal. Even fansubbing something unlicensed is still technically illegal. Downloading is illegal. Openly saying that downloading fansubs is okay as long as you buy a domestic Haruhi DVD afterwards, is not wise. I am not trying to preach that fansubbing is a bad practice. But it is not smart to put a video that advocates fansubbing (even with ""conditions"") on a COMMERCIAL DVD release. This directly contradicts that WARNING message you get when you first put any commercial DVD into a DVD player.I wonder if the executives at Kadokawa pictures, and Kyoto Animation, know that the USA ""fan-made"" extras have this sort of content in them? In particular I refer to the fan-made Episode ""001"" and the credits at the end of every ""episode"". The extras in the FMP:2nd Raid DVD had the Japanese producers at Kyoto Animation stating some slightly negative things about fansubs...I think if they knew what has snuck into the official USA Haruhi DVDs they might object.",5,A show about a weird girl who likes to make strange body movements,1180051200,"05 25, 2007",2007,5177,"['once', 'agree', 'popular', 'show', 'good', 'Probably', 'lot',

This review concerns Volume 1 of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (Limited Edition).BLUF: Worth every pennyDetails: If you're reading this - then you already know the story behind this anime. (If not, I won't spoil the series here.) Watching this series in Broadcast Order is essential to appreciating it.  Volume 1 of the Limited Edition box set includes a gorgeous art box for the DVDs and CDs associated with this season of the show.  It also includes a CD with Music from the series that is actually an imported version of a CD sold on the open market in Japan - and if you like the music in this show, you'll want this CD. Finally, there's beautifully drawn insert that has the show's characters in various poses on both sides that's printed on plastic (the pencil board mentioned in the description and it's actually very nice) and other goodies in the box.So is it worth paying extra for this version versus the Regular Edition? ABSOLUTELY. It's actually a great value:-Same DVD you get with the regular edition (price varies - but $9 as of this writing)-A Gorgeous Art Box-Hare Hare Yukai CD Single (about $25 from Amazon Japan depending on the Dollar/Yen rate)-Other goodies thrown in for good measureFirst time viewers need to know, that you will also want to invest in the other Limited Edition volumes of this series.  Each includes the Regular Edition DVD + an English Subtitled DVD of the show in Broadcast Order (very important) + a US release of the Japanese CDs associated with this season of the show (big value) + other goodies.  The Limited Edition is worth it for the CDs and the Broadcast Order DVDs alone.  The Goodies are what make this a very special Limited Edition release that is well worth the extra money.Also, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND that people who watch this show view it in Broadcast Order the First Time.  If you do this with the English Dub, you'll actually lose part of the story (while this is minor with most anime, but it is particularly true for this series).  Dub Fans, bear with me - you'll appreciate why I tell you that after you've seen it through.The Hare Hare Yukai CD Single contains:-Hare Hare Yukai - the full version of the (pleasantly addictive) ending song used in the Anime Series-Welcome Unknown - the full version of the ending song for the radio drama series broadcast in Japan-Karaoke Versions (No Vocals) of the above songs - so you can embarass yourself in the privacy of your carFinally, if you haven't watched this series yet - there's enough depth to this show that you'll get something different out of every viewing.This series has my strongest recommendation.",5,One of the Best Anime Series of Recent Times - A Must See,1315785600,"09 12, 2011",2011,2720,"[""'re"", 'Anime', 'Otaku', 'understand', 'what', 'Anime', 'Otaku', 'then', 'series', 'review', 'Volume', '1', 'Melancholy', 'Haruhi', 'Suzumiya', 'Limited', 'Edition', '.BLUF', 'Worth', 'pennyDetails', ""'re"", 'reading', 'then', 'already', 'know', 'story', 'anime', 'not', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'series', 'here', 'Watching', 'series', 'Broadcast', 'Order', 'essential', 'appreciating', 'Volume', '1', 'Limited', 'Edition', 'box', 'set', 'gorgeous', 'art', 'box', 'DVDs', 'CDs', 'associated', 'season', 'show', 'also', 'CD', 'Music', 'series', 'actually', 'imported', 'version', 'CD', 'sold', 'open', 'market', 'Japan', 'like', 'music', 'show', ""'ll"", 'want', 'CD', 'Finally', 'beautifully', 'drawn', 'insert', 'show', 'characters', 'various', 'poses', 'sides', 'printed', 'plastic', 'pencil', 'board', 'mentioned', 'description', 'actually', 'very', 'nice', 'other', 'goodies', 'box.So', 'worth', 'paying', 'extra', 'version', 'Regular', 'Edition', 'ABSOLUTELY', 'actually', 'great', 'value', '-Same', 'DVD', 'get', 'regular', 'edition', 'price', 'varies', '9', 'writing', 'Gorgeous', 'Art', 'Box-Hare', 'Hare', 'Yukai', 'CD', 'Single', '25', 'Amazon', 'Japan', 'depending', 'Dollar/Yen', 'rate', 'goodies', 'thrown', 'good', 'measureFirst', 'time', 'viewers', 'need', 'know', 'will', 'also', 'want', 'invest', 'other', 'Limited', 'Edition', 'volumes', 'series', 'Regular', 'Edition', 'DVD', '+', 'English', 'Subtitled', 'DVD', 'show', 'Broadcast', 'Order', 'very', 'important', '+', 'US', 'release', 'Japanese', 'CDs', 'associated', 'season', 'show', 'big', 'value', 'other', 'goodies', 'Limited', 'Edition', 'CDs', 'Broadcast', 'Order', 'DVDs', 'alone', 'Goodies', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'very', 'special', 'Limited', 'Edition', 'release', 'well', 'extra', 'money.Also', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMEND', 'people', 'who', 'watch', 'show', 'view', 'Broadcast', 'Order', 'First', 'Time', 'do', 'English', 'Dub', ""'ll"", 'actually', 'lose', 'part', 'story', 'minor', 'most', 'anime', 'particularly', 'true', 'series', 'Dub', 'Fans', 'bear', ""'ll"", 'appreciate', 'why', 'tell', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'through.The', 'Hare', 'Hare', 'Yukai', 'CD', 'Single', '-Hare', 'Hare', 'Yukai', 'full', 'version', 'pleasantly', 'addictive', 'ending', 'song', 'used', 'Anime', 'Series-Welcome', 'Unknown', 'full', 'version', 'ending', 'song', 'radio', 'drama', 'series', 'broadcast', 'Japan-Karaoke', 'Versions', 'No', 'Vocals', 'above', 'songs', 'can', 'embarass', 'privacy', 'carFinally', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'series', 'yet', 'enough', 'depth', 'show', ""'ll"", 'get', 'something', 'different', 'viewing.This', 'series', 'strongest', 'recommendation']",The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya: Volume 1

1061016,A2BIQJIXLDSJSE,B000NVT0PM,Travis S.,"[1, 1]","I must say that this was one of the first anime series I ever watched after I got into anime (sometime last summer, I can't exactly remember now) and even though I have seen many anime since then, Haruhi has always remained on my top 5 list, because of the really unique characters and storyline. The music from the series is also very enjoyable to me. I must give props to Bandai for this release, as this first box is simply amazing. All of the artwork is great, and the extras are very entertaining. ""Hare Hare Yukai"" is still one of my favorite Japanese songs of all time, so owning a copy of the CD was well worth it for me.If you're starting out with this series, I would highly advise that you watch it in the broadcast order instead of the chronological order. The first broadcast episode does a good job of explaining the characters in the first episode, and leaves ""the best for last"", as in the 8th episode, which is built up to throughout the whole series.If you're a Haruhi fan, this Bandai release is an absolute must have.",5,Haruhi!,1353888000,"11 26, 2012",2012,1037,"['must', 'say', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'anime', 'series', 'ever', 'watched', 'got', 'anime', 'sometime', 'last', 'summer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'remember', 'now', 'even', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'anime', 'then', 'Haruhi', 'always', 'remained', 'top', '5', 'list', 'really', 'unique', 'characters', 'storyline', 'music', 'series', 'also', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'must', 'give', 'props', 'Bandai', 'release', 'first', 'box', 'simply', 'amazing', 'artwork', 'great', 'extras', 'are', 'very', 'entertaining', 'Hare', 'Hare', 'Yukai', 'still', 'one', 'favorite', 'Japanese', 'songs', 'time', 'so', 'owning', 'copy', 'CD', 'was', 'well', 'worth', 'me.If', ""'re"", 'starting', 'out', 'series', 'would', 'highly', 'advise', 'watch', 'broadcast', 'order', 'instead', 'chronological', 'order', 'first', 'broadcast', 'episode', 'good', 'job', 'explaining', 'characters', 'first', 'episode', 'best', 'last', '8th', 'episode', 'built', 'up', 'whole', 'series.If', ""'re"", 'Haruhi', 'fan', 'Bandai', 'release', 'absolute', 'must', 'have']",The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya: Volume 1
