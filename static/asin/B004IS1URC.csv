The acting is terrible, the dialogue inane, the songs are awful.  This is sort of a David DeCoteau wannabe, but without the delicious campiness that makes some of DeCoteau's movies so much fun to watch.  ""Vampire Boys"" isn't fun to watch.

The acting was not deplorable as some have stated, it was okay, the dialogue a bit stilted at times.  The plot was there, weak, but there.  Some new twists on vampire lore; some other movies have used the reflection, cross, and sunshine stuff to a degree, this had a slightly different turn to it which made it a touch more interesting.I guess my biggest problem with the film was it made me think &#34;Twilight&#34; in some respects, albeit substituting Caleb for Bella, and of course, no nudity in Twilight (Jacob going shirtless does not count *winks*).  Not sure why my mind connected with &#34;Twilight&#34; and this film - these vampires didn't sparkle (and we all know real vampires don't sparkle!)  It wasn't totally boring, a nice distraction from homework, all of the actors are more than easy on the eyes, and all presented a decent enough skill of acting.",3,Middle of the road,1398038400,"04 21, 2014",2014,991,"['really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'rave', 'about', 'few', 'others', 'have', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'worse', 'film', 'ever', 'either', 'acting', 'was', 'not', 'deplorable', 'have', 'stated', 'was', 'okay', 'dialogue', 'bit', 'stilted', 'times', 'plot', 'was', 'there', 'weak', 'there', 'new', 'twists', 'vampire', 'lore', 'other', 'movies', 'have', 'used', 'reflection', 'cross', 'sunshine', 'stuff', 'degree', 'had', 'slightly', 'different', 'turn', 'made', 'touch', 'more', 'interesting.I', 'guess', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'think', '34', 'Twilight', '34', 'respects', 'substituting', 'Caleb', 'Bella', 'course', 'nudity', 'Twilight', 'Jacob', 'going', 'shirtless', 'not', 'count', '*winks*', 'Not', 'sure', 'why', 'mind', 'connected', '34', 'Twilight', '34', 'film', 'vampires', 'did', ""n't"", 'sparkle', 'know', 'real', 'vampires', 'do', ""n't"", 'sparkle', 'was', ""n't"", 'totally', 'boring', 'nice', 'distraction', 'homework', 'actors', 'are', 'more', 'easy', 'eyes', 'presented', 'decent', 'enough', 'skill', 'acting']",Vampire Boys
