It doesn't have an actual storyline, but it's a decent educational video. Unlike some I've seen, it's not confusing or unclear in anyway. The use of real kids is good, too. Helps hold my son's attention. He's two and doesn't ask for this video by name, but if I put it in, he usually watches. The colors section is the best I've seen so far.",3,It's okay,1252713600,"09 12, 2009",2009,461,"['okay', 'do', 'how', 'teach', 'colors', 'shapes', 'production', 'value', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'price', ""n't"", 'have', 'actual', 'storyline', 'decent', 'educational', 'video', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'not', 'confusing', 'unclear', 'anyway', 'use', 'real', 'kids', 'good', 'too', 'Helps', 'hold', 'son', 'attention', 'two', ""n't"", 'ask', 'video', 'name', 'put', 'usually', 'colors', 'section', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far']",Brainy Baby - Shapes & Colors VHS

There are computer animations, happy children, lots of fun toys related to the topic.  As always with this series, the music is great.  I like that included is shapes like pentagon and hexagon.  Great lessons, never boring, just what children love!  Finally a video company that cares about high educational standards as much as I do!  (And still knows how to have fun doing it!)

695827,A1GOJL8ZS95UKO,B000063S6K,Mom Of Many Munchkins,"[3, 5]","The Shapes portion of this video begins with a really long song about shapes and foods (triangles are like pizza slices, etc).  I really don't care for the singing voices.  It always sounded to me like they were singing, ""Whilst you know how to name your shapes"".  I had to listen to this over and over and finally realized they they were really singing ""Once you know how to name your shapes"" (at least I think that must be what they are saying because whilst just doesn't make sense).The shapes focused on in this video are circle, square, triangle, rectangle, star, diamond, heart, oval, crescent, and then they have a very little bit with the shapes pentagon, hexagon, and octagon.The very first time I watched this I thought it was annoying.  Everything seemed to be fast and hard to absorb.  As I watched it again I felt that it wasn't quite as bad as I thought at first.  I like the Colors half of the video better.In the Colors section they have a lot of repeats of Baby's First Impressions Colors,  but Brainy Baby has more speaking and adds a few more colors.  The colors are red, blue, yellow, green, orange, purple, brown, pink, black, white, silver and gold.  After a few colors they have a color review.  Just for you to get an idea, for purple they show these things in purple: balloons, flowers, bunny, ball, baby with a scuba outfit on (why?  I don't know.  I guess because it's purple),  slinky, grapes (animated ones and also real ones), egg plant, pool dolphin toy, easter egg, toy turtle and then kids in purple.It is nice that this video tackles two concepts in one video.  I think it's ok but I'm not wildly excited about it.  I really like So Smart Shapes and So Smart Colors better.

She really watches and pays attention to them. I thought this Shapes & Colors one would be good, but it's a little too advanced for her at 9 months old. I'm hopeful that when she's old enough, she'll like it though.
