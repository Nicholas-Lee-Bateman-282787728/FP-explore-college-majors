That... depending on the circumstances, and the particular people we meet... and our willingness to not judge, and to be open to things outside our own experiences, that even the most seemingly black-and-white self-definitions might (then) be allowed to blur and metamorphosize into something quite other than as we were when starting-out. Self-realization with the absence of fear... a fear shaped by societal convention. But... because this film explores mutability of the most profoundly personal type, it may be safer just to laugh at its opera-buffa qualities than to realize that, at its core, it dares to shake us by our ankles to acknowledge that we're never as  safe  as we might believe. Perhaps this is the reason some might find this film offensive, and why, also, societal-variance is so very frequently met with such ridicule, abuse and hatred... it's easier to hate than to believe that truths we hold as most immutable, under those right circumstances, are as fragile as dust on the wind.",5,To Be or NOT To BE ...,1304208000,"05 1, 2011",2011,1213,"['commence', 'et', 'finit', 'par', 'tre', 'femme', 'else', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'also', 'mutability', 'fact', 'identities', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'fixed', 'might', 'safely', 'think', 'depending', 'circumstances', 'particular', 'people', 'meet', 'willingness', 'not', 'judge', 'be', 'open', 'things', 'own', 'experiences', 'even', 'most', 'seemingly', 'black-and-white', 'self-definitions', 'might', 'then', 'be', 'allowed', 'blur', 'metamorphosize', 'something', 'quite', 'other', 'were', 'when', 'starting-out', 'Self-realization', 'absence', 'fear', 'fear', 'shaped', 'societal', 'convention', 'film', 'mutability', 'most', 'profoundly', 'personal', 'type', 'may', 'be', 'safer', 'just', 'laugh', 'opera-buffa', 'qualities', 'realize', 'core', 'shake', 'ankles', 'acknowledge', ""'re"", 'never', 'as', 'safe', 'might', 'believe', 'Perhaps', 'reason', 'might', 'find', 'film', 'offensive', 'why', 'also', 'societal-variance', 'so', 'very', 'frequently', 'met', 'such', 'ridicule', 'abuse', 'hatred', 'easier', 'hate', 'believe', 'truths', 'hold', 'most', 'immutable', 'right', 'circumstances', 'are', 'as', 'fragile', 'dust', 'wind']",N/A

The whole story was unbelievable and the ending especially so, although seeing Gerard Depardieu and Michel Blanc in drag was mildly amusing.  If you want to see this movie, rent it.
