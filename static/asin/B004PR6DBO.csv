I like how she continually guides you to relax various parts of your body during the exercise and doesn't focus on getting the position accurate as much.

1423788,A1MWYQ7RHVHYON,B004PR6DBO,"Sir Gawain ""gary c. e.""","[3, 3]","in Yoga for Stress Reduction with Hala Khouri, Hala does several of the basic postures of yoga and then some but it is her commentary during the yoga demonstrations that is darn insightful. Hala Hhouri talks about the true nature of breathing in yoga and in life. she gives an understanding of breath, movement and stillness that is truly helpful in that it opens up a kind of wisdom - alleviates fear and gives peace of heart. and all this no matter what you look like - big, small, - you don't have to look like a barbie doll (or ken doll).also there is one sequence, the ""Free Movement"" or ""Shaking it off"" part of the dvd (13 minutes) that is a kind of dancing around - the rest of the dvd, yoga positions and commentary (56 minutes) is not. the ""dancing around"" can be for some people a great way of relieving tension and fun to do and afterwards you feel relaxed - as the dvd states; ""Shaking it off"", that is the ""stress"". its a small part of the dvd that the viewer can skip. there is also the two yoga meditations of the instruction that i liked (13 minutes together).now there is one thing i think she should have addressed - she mentions over and over about being grounded and resourced in your own body (Somatic Therapy) - well, if you have a physical condition such as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, your not going to be feeling that - then you might have to find (for the time being) your resource beyond the physical to more of a metaphysical faith/resource. it's like someone saying; ""just be in the NOW"" - so a friend of mine said; ""but what if your NOW is hurting?"". yeah, tell me about it. and there are many therapies such as massage therapy or EFT/tapping or even using crystals and other sundry treatments besides the Somatic Therapy form of body-mind approach to self-healing. just a heads up here.bottom line; yoga has freed me of some old wounds and conflicts - giving me a new center of awareness - an unassuming new strength, living life just a little closer to being at peace with me. yoga can be a very good endeavor, not just striking a pose! THIS yoga dvd has proven that to me. but the heart and mind (not just the body) must be in it.",4,Yoga - with a very good commentary on yourself,1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,2162,"['Yoga', 'Stress', 'Reduction', 'Hala', 'Khouri', 'Hala', 'several', 'basic', 'postures', 'yoga', 'then', 'commentary', 'yoga', 'demonstrations', 'darn', 'insightful', 'Hala', 'Hhouri', 'talks', 'true', 'nature', 'breathing', 'yoga', 'life', 'understanding', 'breath', 'movement', 'stillness', 'truly', 'helpful', 'up', 'kind', 'wisdom', 'alleviates', 'fear', 'peace', 'heart', 'matter', 'what', 'look', 'big', 'small', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'look', 'barbie', 'doll', 'ken', 'doll', '.also', 'one', 'sequence', 'Free', 'Movement', 'Shaking', 'off', 'part', 'dvd', '13', 'minutes', 'kind', 'dancing', 'rest', 'dvd', 'positions', 'commentary', '56', 'minutes', 'not', 'dancing', 'can', 'be', 'people', 'great', 'way', 'relieving', 'tension', 'fun', 'do', 'afterwards', 'feel', 'relaxed', 'dvd', 'Shaking', 'off', 'stress', 'small', 'part', 'dvd', 'viewer', 'can', 'skip', 'also', 'two', 'yoga', 'meditations', 'instruction', 'i', 'liked', '13', 'minutes', 'together', '.now', 'one', 'thing', 'i', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'addressed', 'being', 'grounded', 'resourced', 'own', 'body', 'Somatic', 'Therapy', 'well', 'have', 'physical', 'condition', 'such', 'Chronic', 'Fatigue', 'Syndrome', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'feeling', 'then', 'might', 'have', 'find', 'time', 'being', 'resource', 'physical', 'more', 'metaphysical', 'faith/resource', 'someone', 'saying', 'just', 'be', 'NOW', 'friend', 'mine', 'said', 'what', 'NOW', 'hurting', 'yeah', 'tell', 'are', 'many', 'therapies', 'such', 'massage', 'therapy', 'EFT/tapping', 'even', 'using', 'crystals', 'other', 'sundry', 'treatments', 'Somatic', 'Therapy', 'form', 'body-mind', 'approach', 'self-healing', 'just', 'heads', 'up', 'here.bottom', 'line', 'yoga', 'freed', 'old', 'wounds', 'conflicts', 'giving', 'new', 'center', 'awareness', 'unassuming', 'new', 'strength', 'living', 'life', 'just', 'little', 'closer', 'being', 'peace', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'endeavor', 'not', 'just', 'striking', 'pose', 'THIS', 'yoga', 'dvd', 'proven', 'heart', 'mind', 'not', 'just', 'body', 'must', 'be']",N/A
1423789,A1QJJLTK6DPQJ9,B004PR6DBO,SNOWMAN,"[2, 2]","Yoga for Strees Reduction with Hala Khouri is my favorite yoga DVD. I try to practice yoga 30 minutes to an hour each morning rotating out with different yoga dvds, and this is the only one that I use twice a week. The DVD starts with warm up section of sitting\laying poses (10-15 minutes), next is a section of active standing poses (30 minutes), and then closes with cool down routines sitting/laying 10-15 minutes). Hala Khouri makes you believe you are in yoga class and there is a nice flow to all the routines. It does have a weird stress relief dance segment that I rarely use. The menu lets you pick and choose which routines you want to do. I would recommend this DVD for anyone who uses yoga for stress relief or to remain flexible.",5,JDavis,1355356800,"12 13, 2012",2012,743,"['Yoga', 'Strees', 'Reduction', 'Hala', 'Khouri', 'favorite', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'try', 'practice', 'yoga', '30', 'minutes', 'hour', 'morning', 'rotating', 'out', 'different', 'yoga', 'dvds', 'only', 'one', 'use', 'twice', 'week', 'DVD', 'warm', 'up', 'section', 'sitting\\laying', 'poses', '10-15', 'minutes', 'next', 'section', 'active', 'standing', 'poses', '30', 'minutes', 'then', 'cool', 'down', 'routines', 'sitting/laying', '10-15', 'minutes', 'Hala', 'Khouri', 'believe', 'are', 'yoga', 'class', 'nice', 'flow', 'routines', 'have', 'weird', 'stress', 'relief', 'dance', 'segment', 'rarely', 'use', 'menu', 'pick', 'choose', 'routines', 'want', 'do', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'who', 'yoga', 'stress', 'relief', 'remain', 'flexible']",N/A
