1263675,A3HP7JU4ZORF52,B002DLB170,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"[0, 0]","First let me say that I personally do not have any problem with remakes so I am not holding that against the movie. I would however say that in this case the original is definitely far better. Now this movie and the original is very different so this is not a scene for scene remake, the story have some of the same premise but it is a completely new story, which is usually a good thing, the problem is that this story is quite boring. It's Alive is about a young couple who is expecting their first child, unfortunately however this child happens to be a mutant with teeth and claws and the baby go on a killing rampage from the doctors in the delivery room to squirrels and policemen. Now here is where the remake differs from the original, in the original the baby looks monstrous, and the police know it is the killer and is hunting for it while it run around killing everything in sight, eventually however the parents meet their mutant child and to a certain degree begin to protect it. In the remake however the baby look completely normal so it takes a while before anyone notices that there is something wrong with it, then we have the baby killing and the mother covering up for it, and that is the entire movie.There is very few special effects, very few story elements, very little of anything other than seeing the mother Lenore become more and more neurotic. The first It's Alive was a slasher, and while I do appreciate horror movies that go for mood over gore, this movie fails to build up any mood, it is just drawn out, slow and boring. The end scenes are a little better, at times they manage to be creepy, but generally this movie is just bland and that is I guess the only thing I can say about it. It's Alive is not bad as such, it is just bland.Some of the problems with this movie is that they try to make the baby as strong and scary as in the original while keeping it looking like a normal child, the problem here is that I believe the little mutants in the original could swing around and murder people left and right, however how do a normal looking baby who yes seam to be able to sprout claws and teeth at will, but who still have a normal baby body manage to do that, it do not get scary it just get silly. By all means make a movie about a killer baby who look innocent, but then have the baby be dangerous in some other way that brute physical force.I also think it is a little silly that they changed the reason why Lenore have a mutant baby. In the original movie series these mutant babies where born because of pollution, yes I know that is not realistic but in the context of the movie it was believable, here it is abortion pills bought online which is the cause. It is like Hollywood found out they where to liberal and decided no we can not have pollution be the big bad let us have abortion be so instead. I mean why would they change that, pollution is just as much an issue today as when the first It's Alive was filmed?All in all I did not hate this movie, but I do not think it is a good movie, it is like I said just bland. If you love killer babies movies then you might enjoy it, but for most I do not recommend It's Alive the remake, there are far better horror movies out there, including the original It's Alive, go watch that instead.",2,Boring little mutant monster baby.,1318550400,"10 14, 2011",2011,3289,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'personally', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'problem', 'remakes', 'so', 'am', 'not', 'holding', 'movie', 'would', 'however', 'say', 'case', 'original', 'definitely', 'far', 'better', 'Now', 'movie', 'original', 'very', 'different', 'not', 'scene', 'scene', 'remake', 'story', 'have', 'same', 'premise', 'completely', 'new', 'story', 'usually', 'good', 'thing', 'problem', 'story', 'quite', 'boring', 'Alive', 'young', 'couple', 'who', 'expecting', 'first', 'child', 'unfortunately', 'however', 'child', 'be', 'mutant', 'teeth', 'claws', 'baby', 'go', 'killing', 'rampage', 'doctors', 'delivery', 'room', 'squirrels', 'policemen', 'Now', 'here', 'where', 'remake', 'differs', 'original', 'original', 'baby', 'monstrous', 'police', 'know', 'killer', 'hunting', 'run', 'around', 'killing', 'everything', 'sight', 'eventually', 'however', 'parents', 'meet', 'mutant', 'child', 'certain', 'degree', 'begin', 'protect', 'remake', 'however', 'baby', 'look', 'completely', 'normal', 'while', 'anyone', 'notices', 'something', 'wrong', 'then', 'have', 'baby', 'killing', 'mother', 'covering', 'up', 'entire', 'movie.There', 'very', 'few', 'special', 'effects', 'very', 'few', 'story', 'elements', 'very', 'little', 'anything', 'other', 'seeing', 'mother', 'Lenore', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'neurotic', 'first', 'Alive', 'was', 'slasher', 'do', 'appreciate', 'horror', 'movies', 'go', 'mood', 'gore', 'movie', 'build', 'up', 'mood', 'just', 'drawn', 'out', 'slow', 'boring', 'end', 'scenes', 'are', 'little', 'better', 'times', 'manage', 'be', 'creepy', 'generally', 'movie', 'just', 'bland', 'guess', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'Alive', 'not', 'bad', 'such', 'just', 'bland.Some', 'problems', 'movie', 'try', 'make', 'baby', 'strong', 'scary', 'original', 'keeping', 'looking', 'normal', 'child', 'problem', 'here', 'believe', 'little', 'mutants', 'original', 'could', 'swing', 'around', 'murder', 'people', 'left', 'right', 'however', 'how', 'do', 'normal', 'looking', 'baby', 'who', 'seam', 'be', 'able', 'sprout', 'claws', 'teeth', 'will', 'who', 'still', 'have', 'normal', 'baby', 'body', 'manage', 'do', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'scary', 'just', 'get', 'silly', 'means', 'make', 'movie', 'killer', 'baby', 'who', 'look', 'innocent', 'then', 'have', 'baby', 'be', 'dangerous', 'other', 'way', 'brute', 'physical', 'force.I', 'also', 'think', 'little', 'silly', 'changed', 'reason', 'why', 'Lenore', 'have', 'mutant', 'baby', 'original', 'movie', 'series', 'mutant', 'babies', 'where', 'born', 'pollution', 'yes', 'know', 'not', 'realistic', 'context', 'movie', 'was', 'believable', 'here', 'abortion', 'pills', 'bought', 'online', 'cause', 'Hollywood', 'found', 'where', 'liberal', 'decided', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'pollution', 'be', 'big', 'bad', 'let', 'have', 'abortion', 'be', 'so', 'instead', 'mean', 'why', 'would', 'change', 'pollution', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'issue', 'today', 'when', 'first', 'Alive', 'was', 'filmed', 'did', 'not', 'hate', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'good', 'movie', 'said', 'just', 'bland', 'love', 'killer', 'babies', 'movies', 'then', 'might', 'enjoy', 'most', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'Alive', 'remake', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'horror', 'movies', 'there', 'including', 'original', 'Alive', 'go', 'watch', 'instead']",It's Alive

When I found out he wrote the original draft of the remake's script, I was psyched.  But, alas, I was a bit disappointed with the finished product.  I thought it actually had a cool B-movie thing going on for a while, with some good, rustic atmosphere and some fun, awkward dialogue.  However, there was very little graphic violence which, for my money, a good B horror movie should have.  I know a lot of people don't share that opinion, but if I'm gonna watch a movie about a maniacal killer infant, I want to see some serious, fun grue.  The pacing was also inconsistent and the husband character was completely clueless.  I did kind of like the abrupt, down-beat ending even if it didn't have much visceral punch.  For all of my complaining, though, I did find the film passable and better than its buzz had suggested to me.  Give it a try if you're a Cohen fan.

1263680,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,B002DLB170,David J. Brown,"[18, 24]","Oh, yeah, I know why, because the majority of horror cinema offerings, when they're not sequels, are friggin' remakes!  Right.  That's the real reason why horror remakes make dough.  They get the mainstream simps to see them as if they were new and they get us real horror buffs to see them because we're so damn hungry for horror that we run out of food.  Well, here we are with It's Alive 2009.  Who in the hell would've thought that the 1972 Larry Cohen cheapie of the same name would be worthy of a remake over thirty years later?  NO ONE!  But here it is direct to video ready to be snatched up by the unsuspecting horror geek.  I even had decent to high hopes for this remake seeing that Larry Cohen, the director and writer of the original(as well as Q: The Winged Serpent, Bone, God Told Me To, The Stuff), was involved in its screenplay.  But, then there's two other names listed after his.  Don't know much about this project honestly so I can't speculate on what his and the other screenwriter's contributions were, but I can tell we have a real mess of a horror film on our hands.Lets talk first about the good things this remake does before we get to the real horror.  They slanted the angle of the story from the original.  Sure, they did the usual 'youthing' up of the main characters Frank Davis(James Murray) and Lorna(Bijou Phillips), but they also changed the main plot thrust.  In the original film as soon as the mutant baby is born he's gone and everyone is out to find him.  Father Frank has a bond with the mutant tot and tries to protect him despite the fact that his son is a monsterous killer.  In this remake they scaled the story down.  It mostly takes place in a secluded country home in New Mexico.  Our newly young couple are barely out of college and lets say the pregnancy wasn't planned.  The slant now is how mother Lorna is losing her mind and pulling a Norman Bates for her monster child.  There's great material to be mined here regarding post-pardem syndrome and what a mother's love really is, but I assure you you won't find any of that culled in this film--but that's a negative and we'll save that for the next paragraph.  Secondly, the only other good thing about this film, is Nicholas Pike's(Sleepwalkers, The Stand) score.  It's good and only slightly nostalgic for the original's Bernard Herman score.  That's it.Like I mentioned, the story has so much room for satire and parable that I don't get why the filmmakers settled for doing a typical 'little critter' sneaks up with the camera lense as its point of view thing.  Mutant baby kills, Lorna cleans and hides it up.  Rinse and repeat for about an hour.  Then we get to our climax where two cops and our dimwitted Frank finally realize something weird is going on with Lorna and her not too oftenly seen baby.  That's the other thing, we never see the baby--human or mutant.  I'm not really sure how this thing works, honestly.  It's born and seen as a normal baby.  Frank looks at his son as a normal kid.  But, the thing has claws and razor sharp teeth when it attacks to feed.  So, what's the deal?  Does the baby shape shift into a monster or what?  I suppose so or the character of Frank may get the award for the worst father of the entire existance of fathers.  The movie never gives you any visual information in this regard so I'm just making huge assumptions, assuming that the filmmakers don't think the viewer's stupid enough to believe that Frank never notices his son's claws or sharp teeth.  I could be wrong.  In the original film we only saw glimpses of the baby and when we did it was a combination of a puppet and make up effect both created by the legendary Rick Baker(American Werewolf In London, Gorillas in the Mist, Harry and the Hendersons).  The remake doesn't show much of the baby either, actually this remake shows it even less then the original, but when it does appear in full mutant mode it is completely CGI, and not very convincing.  We get glimpses of CGI claws, CGI snarling faces and body parts, but only in flashes and just long enough to not be convincing still.  Worst of all is the creature design, what little you get to see of it, is really lame.  The mutant baby in this film resembles the green toilet dwelling Ghoulie but pink.  He's laughable.  At least in the original the creature's visage was genuinely eerie and kind of creepy.The acting is all foregettable.  Bijou Phillips does the best transitioning she can muster from normal Grad student, to fumbling mother, to complete nutcase, but the hack script never writes her any convincing bits of pathos to peform the transitions.  Unless, I missed soemthing, at the end when all the bodies are found, the cops have arrived, mommy Lorna has lost it, and Frank is being questioned in his own basement for the murders of missing psycholigists and others, Frank seems to know his baby is killing everyone.  How?  He comes home to find his wife rocking in a chair in the baby's room.  The baby is missing, and in the crib is mutilated remains and he spots a hole in the wall.  Up until this point in the film Frank hasn't even noticed anything funny going on(though, what idiot wouldn't notice how strange his wife is acting?).  When he finds the corpses in his basement and the sheriff corners him, he just suddenly knows his baby is a super strengthed, monster, mutant kid.  Huh?  Did I miss something?  Could this script be this lazily and sloppily written or is there some deleted scenes I'm not aware of?  Don't know, and really don't care.  I doubt it would change my opinion of this film that substantially.  In the original both parents were conflicted and felt very real.  In this remake Frank seems like a dimwitt and the script has Lorna playing the nutty card way too early.Listen, the bottom line is the original is a grindhouse classic.  It has satirical undertones, regarding what caused the Davis baby mutation, and a creepy creature.  It plays with the typical Frankenstein's monster convention of what the creator owes the creations, and how far paternal love is willing to go.  This remake has a nugget of that in it with the mother character and her unflinching committment to protecting her son's secret, but it's all written and played as if she is only doing it because she has lost her mind.  Though, I give this remake some kudos for not giving an over blown back story to the mutant baby(Leatherface has a skin condition--WAH, Michael Myers came from poor abusive red knecks--WAH, Jason misses his mommy--WAH).  The remake keeps the cause of the mutation in the scientific, pseudo-science would be more accurate, realm by alluding to the mutation being caused by experimental drugs taken by Lorna to inspire a miscarriage.  It's a brief scene and seems stuffed into the film just for the giggles of it.  This flick is a mess.  There's some good ideas floating around but nothing of interest was done with any of them. NOTHING IN THIS FILM MAKES IT EVIDENT WHY THE ORIGINAL WAS WORTH REMAKING. Why even remake this film?  Is the title ""It's Alive"" even a name brand?  Is it name brand enough to warrant renting or purchasing a ticket based on it?  Have any of  you people even seen the film that this one is a remake of?  Do any of you know who Larry Cohen is?  Doesn't matter.  Cheap production.  Cheap motivations.  All equaling a take the money and run remake---which is a term I am now inventing to replace the old one, Take the money and run sequel.

After all, look at all of the strikes it had against it.1. First and foremost, it's a Hollywood big-budget remake of an American horror movie that went straight to DVD. If that doesn't set alarm bells off in your head in a culture where 80% of the horror films coming out of Hollywood are remakes/reboots/sequels, you're not paying attention.2. Stars Bijou Phillips, who was always supposed to be the next big thing after Almost Famous and Bully and never made it (her biggest film since: Havoc). In my opinion, it's because she has one of the most annoying voices in all of Hollywood. As the lead, she gets to use it a lot here. Be warned.3. Directed by Josef Rusnak. If that name doesn't mean anything to you, you have forgotten The Thirteenth Floor, a 1999 sci-fi film so badly received it came close to killing the careers of everyone involved. Rusnak didn't direct again until 2007 (his biggest film since: The Art of War II).4. The largest film anyone save Phillips in the principal cast had worked on before this movie was Nanny McPhee.5. Special effects were by Ivo Jivkov. Another name you don't know. Among his work is The Fourth Kind, the 2008 Day of the Dead remake, Mega Snake, the 2006 bomb The Black Dahlia, and Mansquito. And yes, those are the best films to his credit at IMDB.All of which is forgivable in some films, of course. But the movie takes a turn straight into unforgivable territory about two-thirds of the way through, when the script suddenly makes very clear that it's got a not-at-all buried anti-RU486 message inherent in it. Yep, that's ""liberal Hollywood"" for you, right there. If you even think you may be the slightest bit pro-choice, this movie should outrage you beyond belief.

Powers ""show maniac""","[3, 4]","It's Alive the direct to video remake of the shlocky Larry Cohen movie from the 70's is not better or worse than the original but it's certainly no better.  The parents in the new version are younger but differs from the original in that the father in the older film was the monster babys protector. Another change from the prior film is the baby in the original looked like a monster while this baby looks like a normal infant until it opens its mouth and has the teeth of a barracuda.  Bijou Phillips plays mommy and she acts like an airhead and can't even read her lines not sounding like she was reading directions off a box of brownie mix. And as the movie progresses she seems more over-psychotic than over-protective. She even enjoys looking at her mutilated nipple from breast-feeding her bouncing, hungry baby boy.The movie then spends most of the time finding some lame excuse for visitors to the house only to end up as snacks. Two of the munchables are an idiot of a sherrif and his female deputy.  The sherrif is convinced something wrong is happenening at the house and when he and his deputy arrive at the house the power is out-and when the deputy nervously asks ""should I call for back-up?"" the genius sherrif says, ""Naw let's just look around for a bit"".

While it had it's moments, it was certainly no frightfest.First, the differences...This time around, the baby looks totally normal (Or does he?  More on this in a bit).  So, after the slaughter in the delivery room, the police have no suspect  They certainly have no cause to think that the newborn shivering on it's mother's stomach did it, where in the first film it was quite evident since the umbilical cord was chewed through and the baby was GONE.  This version is also told from Lenore's viewpoint, whereas the first film focused on the father, Frank, and his hunt for the mutant infant.  Frank is pretty much reduced to stumbling around cluelessly in this version, watching Lenore slowly going psycho (with ""becoming more withdrawn and somber"" passing for psychosis).  Chris, who was the couple's older son in the original, has been changed to Frank's younger, parapalegic brother.  Making him wheelchair bound seems rather pointless, as it's never used as a plot device (unless you count the requisite ""helpless? victim alone"" scene).  Like the original it also has a shocking ending, although this time it's VERY dark.What went wrong?  Well, the main fault lies with the baby himself (who is actually given a name this time, Daniel).  Apparently, he looks normal enough that Frank never questions anything, yet we know that Daniel possesses long, sharp fingernails (seen in a breastfeeding scene) and a MOUTHFUL of sharp, jagged teeth (seen in a VERY brief climactic close-up).  Does he change form?  Is he gradually mutating as he grows?  This is never explained.  Perhaps Lenore kept trimming his nails, and Frank never saw Daniel with his mouth open, I dunno.  All we're told is that he had a ""growth spurt"", and is ready to be born at the 6 month mark (he""doubled in size"" and is ""a big baby"").  The cause this time is half-heartedly explained as a botched abortion attempt by Lenore via pills.  In the original, the baby attacked when it was scared.  This time, Daniel is simply ""hungry"".  Even with a fridge FULL of breast milk, and all the wild animals (and, in a throwback to the original, family pets) he can eat, he still resorts to attacking hapless people.  Again, never really explained.  Then there's the spotty CGI; Daniel has a head full of brown hair, then, he's bald.  Then, back to hair, then bald.  As if the CGI crew weren't even talking to each other during production (""Oh, he's supposed to have hair?  We made him bald.  Oh well."").  I think even his clothes switch from one scene to the next (but then, who can really notice in split-second glimpses?).  And in the ""big reveal"" at the end, Daniel looks like a cross between a Gremlin, and Chucky from ""Child's Play"".  The freaky, muscular, big-eyed, pug-nosed, three-fingered design of the truly mutant baby in the original film haunts me to this day; this time, he just comes across as a fast, REALLY mad baby, with a severe need to see a dentist.  You don't really see the ending coming, which is a nice twist, but then, as you're waiting for the wind-down and closure, the film just suddenly ends, as if they ran out of script.  Or money.  Which, along with the CGI gaffes, is probably why this never found a distributor, floated around in limbo for a year, and then went straight to DVD.  Although it does have a few interesting moments going for it, maybe this ""It's Alive"" should have just stayed in limbo.

1263693,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B002DLB170,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 4]","I'll make my review brief as there's not much to say about the 2008 version of ""It's Alive,"" except that it is yet another unnecessary remake of the 70s horror film. Also, I might add that the new film is not entertaining (in whatever way you might define it), and not definitely scary.Bijou Phillips is a grad student Lenore Harker taking a break because she is expecting a baby. She is happy to live with her loving boyfriend Frank Davis (James Murray) and his younger brother Chris (Raphal Coleman). But strange things start to happen at the hospital where the baby Daniel was born and her home too, and everything points to the obvious conclusion that most viewers know before the film begins.I said ""strange,"" but the fact is it is much worse than just ""strange,"" involving several dead bodies. However, the film (directed by Josef Rusnak best known for his ""The Thirteenth Floor"") completely fails to generate tension. The film is hardly scary and death scenes are all bland and dull. It doesn't even have a campy charm that makes some horror movies entertaining.
