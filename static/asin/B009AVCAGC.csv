The other dvd was to advance, after looking at the sample video I purchase the AM/PM Yoga by Jane Fonda. I did the 2 of the am routines this morning and really enjoyed how slower it is. I am a true beginner and I think this is for me, I like that it has 3 different routines and if you are short on time you can do 1 or 2 or all 3. I will update my review after I have done it a little longer. But if you've never done yoga before you might like this one because it is much slower and not to advance like some of the other dvd's that states beginners and when you purchase it, it really is not.This is a update from my original review. Love this dvd, the only thing I think needs work is the breathing exercise, it's kinda all over the place sometimes. Other than that this is a excellent cd for new beginners and older generation, I'm 46 and this cd is just what I was looking for. I really like the 15 minutes AM increments, when you don't have time to do all 3 you can just do 1 or 2 are all 3. The PM relaxtion is good to do at the end of the day.

I'm strong, but not really fit and flexible, and I prefer working out at home. After a lot of experimenting, this is my weekly routine:M,W,F: I do the Jane Fonda Walk Out--the WHOLE thing. It takes about 50 minutes, I recommend snug workout pants. You need to wear running/walking/tennis shoes and have a sturdy chair with no arms available. By the time I'm done I feel sweaty, but great. Not sore, but like I've really done my body a favor.T, TH, Sat: I do the Trim, Tone & Flex video. You need some basic hand weights (I'm on only 2 lbs right now,) and a sturdy chair. Wear shoes.Sunday morning: I do the AM part (the first 3 sections) of the Jane Fonda AM/PM Yoga. It is a great way to begin the day on a Sunday. You'll need a mat and hand weights.EVERY evening, before bed: I do the PM part (the last 2 sections, and often the balance section, which is only 5 minutes.)I haven't seen a lot of progress on the scale, but I feel amazing. I can tell the difference in my energy level, my posture, and the quality of my sleep. I love the fact that I don't leave the morning workouts feeling sore and unmotivated to do them again. On the contrary, I wake up looking forward to doing them!The Jillian Michaels workouts are too much for me at this point and I don't like her attitude.

And, I enjoy it in the evening at times. But, as another reviewer says, I find it far too slow for me. I do Ashtanga Yoga, which is fast and flowing. So this seems far too slow. But, it's marketed to beginners and that's ok.Fonda does a decent job of instructions. She's calming and relaxing as one would expect from a 75-year-old. Some of the exercises are really very good like the plank on a chair. I can hold a plank on the floor 90 seconds and find the plank on the chair every bit as challenging. And none of the exercises will likely hurt anyone and that's important, especially for older people and beginners. Yoga exercise can hurt people and it happens every day. So safety is just as important in yoga as any other workout. Moreover, studies show that yoga is an absolutely great workout. It tones muscles and older people need that badly.If you're older and/or a beginner and want to get some short but effective exercise into your day, I recommend this DVD. If, on the other hand, you're used to power yoga and want something faster and more challenging, you probably won't like this.- Susanna K.

Jane is in her 70's now and she emphasizes that learning to balance is extremely important for anyone over 50 to practice.The videos are broken down into 15 minutes or less. First session is abs and back, second is energy and overall strength. The third one is vitality and includes weights (but Jane says you can use water bottles if you don't have weights). I personally use 5 and 8 pounders depending on the intensity of the workout.These are all yoga moves and do seem to energize the viewer.
