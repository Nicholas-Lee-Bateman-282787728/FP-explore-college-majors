1569617,A1URPQ4S8TJCR4,B008KZVNFS,Bert vanC Bailey,"[3, 3]","For those impatient with the facile chumminess of Downton Abbey's aristocrats, and its Dallas-on-the-moors veneers, this made-for-TV series is a must-see.This is a far truer, more realistic portrayal of Edwardian England based on a novel by FM Ford, a fine writer--though a less-than-considerate ""bounder"" by his own and others' accounts (see my review ofQuartet - The Merchant Ivory Collection, with Alan Bates, Maggie Smith and Isabelle Adjani). It is far more clear-eyed about the times, that scene and those people, and so much less ""about the gowns.""So expect a tale full of insufferable snobberry, nasty prejudices and very crippling repressions. I gather in the book the male lead is quite detestable, unlike as Benedict Cumberbatch delivers him, 'though the virtue of this production is that, among others, I'll be reading it! The female lead may be a bit too liberated for a full century ago, but that's no great sin; it's almost plausible, since she's paired with a hyper-principled but little-boyish man.Cumberbatch does well, stiff and lugubrious but far more human than in the ""Sherlock"" series (and equipped with a superb voice, up there with Burton and Jeremy Irons). Perhaps in her best role yet, Rebecca Hall, as ever, is swan-like beautiful yet sometimes also verges on duck-ugly, making her totally enchanting to watch. Both prove themselves top-drawer leads in plum roles, and well-launched toward big cinematic things. And there's no lack of good support from the rest of the solid cast.The art direction--including some grim Edwardian dresses, rooms and castles that alternate with their opposite counterparts in gorgeousness--is second to none.Highest recommendation.",5,Delightful production of FMF's tale of lugubrious and passionate Edwardians,1395792000,"03 26, 2014",2014,1690,"['impatient', 'facile', 'chumminess', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'aristocrats', 'Dallas-on-the-moors', 'veneers', 'made-for-TV', 'series', 'must-see.This', 'far', 'truer', 'more', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'Edwardian', 'England', 'based', 'novel', 'FM', 'Ford', 'fine', 'writer', 'less-than-considerate', 'bounder', 'own', 'others', 'accounts', 'see', 'review', 'ofQuartet', 'Merchant', 'Ivory', 'Collection', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Isabelle', 'Adjani', 'far', 'more', 'clear-eyed', 'times', 'scene', 'people', 'so', 'much', 'less', 'gowns', 'So', 'expect', 'tale', 'full', 'insufferable', 'snobberry', 'nasty', 'prejudices', 'very', 'crippling', 'repressions', 'gather', 'book', 'male', 'lead', 'quite', 'detestable', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'virtue', 'production', 'others', ""'ll"", 'be', 'reading', 'female', 'lead', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'liberated', 'full', 'century', 'ago', 'great', 'sin', 'almost', 'plausible', 'paired', 'hyper-principled', 'little-boyish', 'man.Cumberbatch', 'well', 'stiff', 'lugubrious', 'far', 'more', 'human', 'Sherlock', 'series', 'equipped', 'superb', 'voice', 'up', 'there', 'Burton', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'role', 'yet', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'ever', 'swan-like', 'beautiful', 'yet', 'sometimes', 'also', 'duck-ugly', 'making', 'totally', 'enchanting', 'watch', 'prove', 'top-drawer', 'leads', 'plum', 'roles', 'well-launched', 'big', 'cinematic', 'things', 'lack', 'good', 'support', 'rest', 'solid', 'cast.The', 'art', 'direction', 'including', 'grim', 'Edwardian', 'dresses', 'rooms', 'castles', 'alternate', 'opposite', 'counterparts', 'gorgeousness', 'second', 'none.Highest', 'recommendation']",Parade's End

It was very refreshing to see her earlier work in a most interesting and challenging role. A great story of the Edwardian period and the horrors and destinies of those whose fate in WWI was almost certain death. The choice of returning to England in disgrace or going to a front line unit and almost certain death was made without hesitation (or regret). The film was a very revealing look into the moral culture of the times and the absurdity of the significance of relationships which would cause Christopher's father to commit suicide (based only on gossip, rumor, and the evidence of a complete strange, Ruggles). It was surreal at times, but very thought provoking. An excellent story, well done. The quality of the DVD was poor, but the overall excellence of the story totally caused this to be a non issue.

1569622,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B008KZVNFS,Doug Anderson,"[3, 9]","Parade's End will likely confuse Downton Abbey fans at first because it is a completely different (as in much more complex) kind of narrative and its characters are much more modern (as in divided and uncertain creatures not all of a piece with themselves or their time periods). It is about a hyper-Torified aristocrat named Christopher Tietjens who wants not to be a hyper-Torified aristocrat and thus sabotages his own historical trajectory (usually a job done by WWI in Edwardian character and class pieces) by impulsively marrying himself off to his opposite, the hyper-modern anti-Toff Sylvia Satterthwaite (who will immediately annoy some and thrill other viewers, Lady Mary she's not). He questions his decision even before he goes through with it but go through with it he does. Outwardly, he stays with her out of honor (or at least that is what he would like others to believe and perhaps what he himself would like to believe), but the undeniable and ineluctable attraction reveals that Tietjens is never completely certain of his own motives. The characters don't know what quite to make of themselves and we don't know what quite to make of them (except that everyone and everything is coming undone and sex, more than WWI, seems to be the reason why). Every scene of this series is disorienting and each new character introduced opens up another level of confusion and layer of uncertainty. I guess the idea is that we, like the characters, aren't supposed to be able to orient ourselves in this inbetween world (the past is dying but not quite dead, the future is kicking but as yet unborn) that satisifes no one (if so, this thing is a magnificent success). Parade's End is like the avant-garde anti-dote to Downton Abbey (and its carefully managed Victorian narrative that allows everyone ample time to decide who they want to be and which historical epoch--the Victorian or the modern, which seem to co-exist in relative harmony--- best suits the character they've so carefully developed and the life they've so carefully chosen). In Parade's End there is no time for such calculations. The upheaval's are more cognitive than social and the characters are incapable of self-adjustment or compromise or definitive action (every action in this series seems to be followed by a reversal), so the drama is primarily internal and unresolved. Even the author seems uncertain what to do with his characters (and seems more comfortable moving back and forth in time than in proceeding forward). Its very un-British really (more storm and stress than staid and steady) so its no surprise that this was written by Ford Madox Ford (whose father was German). Oh dear (we can all hear Violet saying). In these period and character studies, the hope (expressed by the characters) is that the war will resolve or at least simplify things and make them clearer (as in make social distinctions less clear and life easier for all concerned). In Downton this is not the case, as Matthew becomes more of a Toff (and preserver of social distinctions) after the war than he ever was before the war; however, this is true in Parade's End, where the war does indicate to Tietjens that in this new world, honor, while still important and valued by some, is no longer a value that holds the world together (and can even be destructive when wrongly applied). But what really distinguishes these two series from one another is not in the way they each treat war but in the way they each treat desire and its effect on consciousness and perspective. At Downton, desire (Matthew's desire for Mary) is what preserves rank and privilege and point of view; whereas in Parade's End, desire (Tietjens desire for Sylvia) is what makes Tietjens realize that his own perspective is a limited one. And this difference is, in the end, what separates the Tory construction that is Downton Abbey (and its vision of Brits as exemplary epoch and epoch-transtion managers) from the modernist construction that is Parade's End (wherein entire world views and psychologies are made obsolete in the course of one passionate afternoon long before the war, even though it may take a war and the destruction of a world and of a make-believe class---and of a tree--- to convince Tietjens that this is so and for him to begin to view the world and his place in it through a new multi-perspectived--modernist-- lens because of it).",4,Parade's End and Downton Abbey,1362441600,"03 5, 2013",2013,4396,"['Parade', 'End', 'will', 'likely', 'confuse', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'fans', 'first', 'completely', 'different', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'kind', 'narrative', 'characters', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'modern', 'divided', 'uncertain', 'creatures', 'not', 'piece', 'time', 'periods', 'hyper-Torified', 'aristocrat', 'named', 'Christopher', 'Tietjens', 'who', 'not', 'be', 'hyper-Torified', 'aristocrat', 'thus', 'sabotages', 'own', 'historical', 'trajectory', 'usually', 'job', 'done', 'WWI', 'Edwardian', 'character', 'class', 'pieces', 'impulsively', 'marrying', 'opposite', 'hyper-modern', 'anti-Toff', 'Sylvia', 'Satterthwaite', 'who', 'will', 'immediately', 'annoy', 'thrill', 'other', 'viewers', 'Lady', 'Mary', 'not', 'questions', 'decision', 'even', 'go', 'Outwardly', 'honor', 'least', 'what', 'would', 'like', 'others', 'believe', 'perhaps', 'what', 'would', 'like', 'believe', 'undeniable', 'ineluctable', 'attraction', 'reveals', 'Tietjens', 'never', 'completely', 'certain', 'own', 'motives', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'quite', 'make', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'quite', 'make', 'everyone', 'everything', 'coming', 'undone', 'sex', 'more', 'WWI', 'be', 'reason', 'why', 'scene', 'series', 'disorienting', 'new', 'character', 'introduced', 'up', 'level', 'confusion', 'layer', 'uncertainty', 'guess', 'idea', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'able', 'orient', 'inbetween', 'world', 'past', 'dying', 'not', 'quite', 'dead', 'future', 'kicking', 'yet', 'unborn', 'one', 'so', 'thing', 'magnificent', 'success', 'Parade', 'End', 'avant-garde', 'anti-dote', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'carefully', 'managed', 'Victorian', 'narrative', 'everyone', 'ample', 'time', 'decide', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'historical', 'epoch', 'Victorian', 'modern', 'seem', 'co-exist', 'relative', 'harmony', 'best', 'suits', 'character', ""'ve"", 'so', 'carefully', 'developed', 'life', ""'ve"", 'so', 'carefully', 'chosen', 'Parade', 'End', 'time', 'such', 'calculations', 'upheaval', 'are', 'more', 'cognitive', 'social', 'characters', 'are', 'incapable', 'self-adjustment', 'compromise', 'definitive', 'action', 'action', 'series', 'be', 'followed', 'reversal', 'drama', 'primarily', 'internal', 'unresolved', 'Even', 'author', 'uncertain', 'what', 'do', 'characters', 'more', 'comfortable', 'moving', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'proceeding', 'forward', 'very', 'un-British', 'really', 'more', 'storm', 'stress', 'staid', 'steady', 'surprise', 'was', 'written', 'Ford', 'Madox', 'Ford', 'father', 'was', 'German', 'Oh', 'dear', 'can', 'hear', 'Violet', 'saying', 'period', 'character', 'studies', 'hope', 'expressed', 'characters', 'war', 'will', 'resolve', 'least', 'simplify', 'things', 'make', 'clearer', 'make', 'social', 'distinctions', 'clear', 'life', 'easier', 'concerned', 'Downton', 'not', 'case', 'Matthew', 'more', 'Toff', 'preserver', 'social', 'distinctions', 'war', 'ever', 'was', 'war', 'however', 'true', 'Parade', 'End', 'where', 'war', 'indicate', 'Tietjens', 'new', 'world', 'honor', 'still', 'important', 'valued', 'no', 'longer', 'value', 'world', 'together', 'can', 'even', 'be', 'destructive', 'when', 'wrongly', 'applied', 'what', 'really', 'two', 'series', 'one', 'not', 'way', 'treat', 'war', 'way', 'treat', 'desire', 'effect', 'consciousness', 'perspective', 'Downton', 'desire', 'Matthew', 'desire', 'Mary', 'what', 'rank', 'privilege', 'point', 'view', 'whereas', 'Parade', 'End', 'desire', 'Tietjens', 'desire', 'Sylvia', 'what', 'Tietjens', 'realize', 'own', 'perspective', 'limited', 'one', 'difference', 'end', 'what', 'Tory', 'construction', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'vision', 'Brits', 'exemplary', 'epoch', 'epoch-transtion', 'managers', 'modernist', 'construction', 'Parade', 'End', 'wherein', 'entire', 'world', 'views', 'psychologies', 'are', 'made', 'obsolete', 'course', 'one', 'passionate', 'afternoon', 'long', 'war', 'even', 'may', 'take', 'war', 'destruction', 'world', 'make-believe', 'class', '-and', 'tree', 'convince', 'Tietjens', 'so', 'begin', 'view', 'world', 'place', 'new', 'multi-perspectived', 'modernist']",Parade's End

1569628,AYPS4RCXEFSJP,B008KZVNFS,K. Boullosa,"[4, 4]","I have not read the original set of four novels by Ford Madox Ford upon which this series was based - I understand that much of one of those novels was excised from the screenplay here.  Ordinarily, I am disappointed by novel-screen transfers, so perhaps not having read the original material has enhanced my admiration of this series, which is literate, beautifully produced, and superbly acted.The painful story of Christopher Tietjens, a product of Britain's late 19th century-early 20th century class system, focuses on Tietjens's moral and emotional struggles as World War I engulfs Europe.  Tietjens is a deeply conservative man employed as a mathematician by the government, producing statistical analyses for it.  We learn early that he has been entrapped into marriage with a beautiful but calculating socialite named Sylvia, due to an out of wedlock pregnancy that we (and he) are never certain is his doing.  Tietjens's struggles to achieve balance between his natural reserve and values (the 18th century against the 19th, the country against the city, as he defiantly puts it), amid events that overtake his personal life and his life as a citizen of a country at war, are demonstrated with great delicacy by Benedict Cumberbatch.  Cumberbatch offers a beautifully paced, nuanced portrait of an emotionally constricted man pushed nearly beyond endurance by the imperatives imposed on him by a world war and an unhappy marriage. Ford Madox Ford intended this to be an anti-war novel, but even not having read the tetralogy, it seemed as if the writers chose to emphasize the love triangle that develops among Tietjens, the wife who marries him for social convenience, and the young suffragette with whom he falls in love, and to refract the horrors of the war through these relationships, rather than the other way around. Complicating matters for Tietjens is his love for the son Sylvia bears after their marriage, and whose real paternity he quickly ceases to care about, bonding with the child and doing his best to be a responsible and loving father.There are a great many strands to this story, which covers a period beginning before and ending shortly after World War I.  Cumberbatch's performance is subtle and moving.  He conveys Tietjens' deeply rooted ideas about honor, almost a confused sense of having been born in the wrong place at the wrong time, and his titanic efforts to free himself sufficiently to respond to love and warmth. Given the nearly Asperger-like reserve that shackles so much of Tietjens's persona, those struggles are wrenching to witness.

1569629,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B008KZVNFS,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[63, 66]","Oddly enough, this handsome co-production (BBC and HBO) of ""Parade's End"" isn't even the first adaptation of this wartime saga that I've seen this month!  BBC has also dusted another version from 1964 out of their archives for DVD release, and I watched that one prior to settling down to this most current version.  Although it has no particular bearing on my comments about this interpretation, it might be of interest to you if you love the story.  It features nice performances (Jeanne Moody is merciless as Sylvia) and boasts a young Judi Dench as the second female lead Valentine.  I love Dench, so it was a win-win!  Ford Madox Ford's ""Parade's End"" is an epic tale of love, scandal, marriage, and war.  It is also about propriety, integrity, and retaining gentlemanly values as the world crumbles around you.  It has a very moral center which is why the 1964 version didn't even feel particularly dated, and this lovely new adaptation is nicely stylized between the modern and the old-fashioned.  The original publications were actually a series of four shorter novels released between 1924-28 that were pulled together and packaged under the new title of ""Parade's End.""  And pretty much, with this journey, you're getting the bulk of the tale as related through the first three of these novels (the fourth is largely dismissed critically).There is no denying the extraordinary efforts that the creators have employed to make this prestige piece a can't miss proposition for adult audiences.  With beautiful production values, vivid lead performances and an incredibly literate script from premiere playwright Tom Stoppard, ""Parade's End"" presents a powerful, but not overstated, character journey set against the backdrop of World War I.  We pick up with the characters prior to the war, and leave them on the other side.  In between, though, everything changes about the lifestyles to which they have become accustomed.  The star is Benedict Cumberbatch, who plays Christopher Tietjens. Tietjens is an upright aristocrat trapped in a rather complicated marriage to Sylvia (Rebecca Hall). After establishing the unpleasantness of this pairing, the story has Tietjens meeting a free spirited suffragette (Adelaide Clemens). The remainder of the story follows these three principles, and assorted other characters, as they navigate a world ravaged by war.Brief Synopsis (No major spoilers, but don't read if you don't want a quick outline of events):Told in five parts, the story begins in 1908.  In the introductory chapter, we meet the three central characters. As Tietjens attempts to be the proper gentleman in every circumstance, the cards seem stacked against him. Cuckolded by a vicious wife, intrigued by a new love, and trying to be a supportive friend, he finds himself in the middle of drama and scandal that is completely unwarranted. Playing off themes of class and gender, Tietjens is almost victimized by propriety and the results are very personal and devastating.  These complications lead to a stint in military service while the war rages. He gets stationed in France and later in Belgium, the conflict is just one more component in his constant struggle for understanding. Plagued by moral and social constraints, the war only compounds these concerns. It is almost a physical manifestation of an internal battle. While he will see some fighting, the biggest challenges still come from within.  But as the war comes to a close, Tietjens must return home and try to reconcile the horrors he's seen. But into whose arms will he find himself?  The war and his recent experiences with Sylvia have really taken a toll, and his soul is battered and bruised. As he recounts the trauma, the confession serves as a catharsis. But is it too late to claim a new life?End SynopsisThe supporting cast is filled with great and familiar faces.  Not everyone, though, has a lot to do.  Miranda Richardson, Claire Higgins, Rupert Everett, Janet McTeer, Roger Allam, Rufus Sewell, and Jack Huston are among some of the more recognizable faces.  Rebecca Hall elicits some sympathy as Sylvia (not an easy thing to do) and is quite good.  She has been rather inconsistent or unremarkable in some of her past roles (one of 2012's worst performances in Stephen Frears' terrible misfire ""Lay The Favorite""), but she acquits herself well here.  Of course, it helps that she gets all the great withering lines!  The piece, however, is just one more showcase for the increasingly impressive Cumberbatch.  His versatility and talent are becoming a force to be reckoned with!  He is fantastic throughout in a challenging role.  A slight miscalculation for me was Clemens as Valentine.  Supposed to be a strong suffragette, she comes off a bit wan and less interesting than those around her.  Overall, this is a dignified period piece that takes its time.  It requires patience and rewards it.  It may not be for every taste but I, for one, was more than happy to take this emotional sojourn.  About 4 1/2 stars.

It has an excellent cast. Its very good visually in terms of photography and sets. But the script has problems.They set themselves an impossible task in trying to adapt a complex series of books into a very few hours of television. There is just too much in terms of story and characters to cover in so little time. At best, it can be said to give an impressionistic view into the book or maybe just into the era. There are some interesting scenes, but the whole itself just didn't work. The early episodes are also rather odd because every negative or regretful comment about the war falls flat because we are rarely seeing anything to do with the war on the screen. The war is really absent through most of the series.The script spends far too long getting to the high point which is in my opinion the story in the book ""No More Parades"". It then neglects to spend enough time or enough care on that part of the story. They do a massive, scattershot build-up over several episode full of detail that could easily be got rid of and then neglect that on which time and care should have been spent.The other thing that didn't work for me is that the first few episodes were pure soap opera. Sometimes I wondered if Benedict Cumberbatch was just a supporting character in his own story. The story was somewhat turned inside out with the women characters being made the center of the drama rather than ""Tietjens"" up until really the last episode. It does turn around completely in that last episode. Cumberbatch puts in a very fine performance and established for me an attachment to the story/characters that I didn't have until then. The reunion scene at the house after the war was particuarly moving as were many of the war scenes with the commanding officer at the front and certain other things I will not spoil.Steven Robertson as Colonel Bill Williams was exceptional in a small but very important part.It was a long time getting there, but the last two episodes were more than worth it.",3,a first-class drama done with an uneven script,1357948800,"01 12, 2013",2013,2100,"['adaptation', 'series', 'British', 'novels', 'telling', 'story', 'life', 'period', 'world', 'war', 'one', 'excellent', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'visually', 'terms', 'photography', 'sets', 'script', 'problems.They', 'set', 'impossible', 'task', 'trying', 'adapt', 'complex', 'series', 'books', 'very', 'few', 'hours', 'television', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'terms', 'story', 'characters', 'cover', 'so', 'little', 'time', 'best', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'give', 'impressionistic', 'view', 'book', 'maybe', 'just', 'era', 'are', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'whole', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'early', 'episodes', 'are', 'also', 'rather', 'odd', 'negative', 'regretful', 'comment', 'war', 'flat', 'are', 'rarely', 'seeing', 'anything', 'do', 'war', 'screen', 'war', 'really', 'absent', 'most', 'series.The', 'script', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'getting', 'high', 'point', 'opinion', 'story', 'book', 'No', 'More', 'Parades', 'then', 'spend', 'enough', 'time', 'enough', 'care', 'part', 'story', 'do', 'massive', 'scattershot', 'build-up', 'several', 'episode', 'full', 'detail', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'got', 'rid', 'then', 'neglect', 'time', 'care', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'spent.The', 'other', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'were', 'pure', 'soap', 'opera', 'Sometimes', 'wondered', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'was', 'just', 'supporting', 'character', 'own', 'story', 'story', 'was', 'somewhat', 'turned', 'women', 'characters', 'being', 'made', 'center', 'drama', 'rather', 'Tietjens', 'up', 'really', 'last', 'episode', 'turn', 'around', 'completely', 'last', 'episode', 'Cumberbatch', 'very', 'fine', 'performance', 'established', 'attachment', 'story/characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'then', 'reunion', 'scene', 'house', 'war', 'was', 'particuarly', 'moving', 'were', 'many', 'war', 'scenes', 'commanding', 'officer', 'front', 'certain', 'other', 'things', 'will', 'not', 'spoil.Steven', 'Robertson', 'Colonel', 'Bill', 'Williams', 'was', 'exceptional', 'small', 'very', 'important', 'part.It', 'was', 'long', 'time', 'getting', 'there', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'were', 'more']",Parade's End

1569647,A3JLOIXFM75QNV,B008KZVNFS,"Valerya Couto ""LOTRsherlockHPFreak""","[8, 10]","Parade's End is a 5 part mini-series that is at times complicated, frustrating and utterly beautiful. Taking place just before WW1 and during, it is more than just a war film, it is also a maddening tale of a brilliant man always trying to do what is right. Benedict Cumberbatch plays Christopher Tietjens, an extremely bright, intellegant gentleman (in every sense of the term), who gets thrown into a marriage of duty.  Though the backstory is sparce, what we know is he meets a beautiful woman, Sylvia (Rebecca Hall) on the train and well, it all very quickly leads to a baby. Unfortunately, it is never known if the baby is utterly Christopher's, as Sylvia is not exactly a proper lady in certain regards. But, duty-bound, he marries her quickly. From this point on, we are witness to a marriage only by name. Sylvia is a selfish, arrogant snob who has absolutely no problem with sleeping around for her own amusement. She barely acknowledges her son, looks down upon her husband, and pretty much makes a mockery of their union. She is a typical, rich, spoiled brat. Christopher has the patience of a saint. He puts up with all of this, with all of her, knowing exactly what it is she is doing, and has done. Even when Sylvia runs away to Germany with her lover, he refuses to divorce her or in any way shed light on the scandal.That is not to say he is without faults. He makes absolutely no demands of his wife. Clearly, there is zero intimacy and his attitude towards her is polite and straight to the point. She finds him cold, and many a time tries to elicit some sort of response or feeling from him, but all in vain. I'm not quite sure what to make of it since again, we get so little backstory. I have not read the novels so maybe someone can shed some light on this matter. It is almost frustrating at times to watch these two characters on screen because you want something to happen, but it never comes to fruition. He takes her back without thought when she gets tired of her lover, and she returns to a life nearly identical to the one she left behind. And then The War strikes and everything that Christopher has tried to keep maintained, his beliefs and principals and even his personal life, slowly start to unravel.Benedict Cumberbatch is the perfect actor for this role. I'm not sure how he compares to the character in the novel, but I couldn't care less on that account. He is surrounded by this almost constant melancholy and every move is made with precision. He is so subtle in his performance, so controlled that at the rare times that he lets go, it's just breathtaking to witness. His voice, a deep, grave rumble, takes a few minutes to get used to as it is quite different from his usual low-toned, sonorous baritone, but his eyes are so expressive and haunting. As I write this, the news that he has been nominated for an Emmy for this performance comes as no surprise. Parade's End is beautiful, but Cumberbatch is the real reason to watch it.Rebecca Hall also does a wonderful job as the spoiled socialite who knows exactly how to work men. She can make them do whatever she wants. Everyone falls under her spell. Everyone, of course, except her husband. It drives her completely mad that she can't get a rise out of him and she tries so very hard. She is a hard character to like or empathize with, but there are a few scenes where you can't really help but feel sorry for her. One scene you would swear she loathes Christopher, and another she is defending him to her lover as the last decent man in all of England. She admires his brilliance but mocks him for it. I don't think she quite knows how to behave around him. He can do no wrong and that infuriates her. But when she bares her soul for him (in a touching scene, albeit a short one) you really have to believe her and we get a glimpse at the passion that brought them together in the first place. They are an odd pair, mis-matched in so many ways, but you just can't help but want more of them.The cinematography is beautiful and vivid, from the posh London to the war-torn trenches and everything in between. Once again HBO has made a stunning mini-series and the production value is evident here.The one let-down has to be the character of Valentine Wannop, played by Adelaide Clemens. She is a sweet sort of girl, that Christopher accidently meets as a suffragette, and it's all secretive smiles and steamy stares from there. Her character felt lacking for me, and though I got a feeling of genuine affection from her towards Christopher, it still felt unrealistic, even towards the end. I can see the appeal, that she is so far removed from Sylvia that Christopher can't help but feel something for her. Where Sylvia is over-the-top, Valentine is modest and bland. But not so modest that she won't be his mistress, a task easier said than done. The final confrontation between Christopher, Sylvia and Valentine felt rushed, artificial, and well, unresolved. I was hoping for something rather grand, but it felt a bit flat.I would love to rewatch it some day, as I'm sure I missed some things, especially regarding the war, and the political aspects around it. This is one of these series that would definitely benefit from numerous viewings so you don't miss any of the nuances that make it so enjoyable to watch. Also, I believe this is the correct Blu-ray for the US and Canada, region 1. I noticed there were numerous versions of Parade's End on amazon, and it looks like people may have bough the wrong one. According to the specs, this looks to be the correct one.",4,"Beautifully made, slightly imperfect- some spoilers",1374105600,"07 18, 2013",2013,5569,"['Parade', 'End', '5', 'part', 'mini-series',
