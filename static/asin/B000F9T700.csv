985991,A2PDN9AI5TQYB0,B000F9T700,Aiken,"[26, 36]","While there are a few worthwhile moments on these discs (mostly in Ren Seeks Help), in general they're uninspired and tedious.  The writing is bland and shallow and focuses too much on being able to do the stuff they weren't allowed to do before.  It's great to be uncensored and unfettered, but when all you do is take advantage of the opportunity, it's easy to forget to deliver actual entertainment, too.  There's also a tendency to draw things out much longer than necessary, almost like the artists wanted to show off their work, dwelling on certain shots and motions for inexplicably long periods.  I would get bored in the middle of scenes, waiting for them to get to the (inevitable and obvious) punchlines.Other than John's voicing of Ren, and Ralph Bakshi's cameo, the voice acting is uneven and monotonous.  The animation lipsync is pretty erratic as well, sometimes bang on, sometimes boggling bad, like they changed the joke afterwards and didn't feel like re-animating.Remarkably, the reason why I give this two stars (instead of the minimum of one) is the extra material with John talking about the show and various bits of animation industry trivia.  He's actually quite entertaining and made it worth the bother to have watched these discs.  Frankly, I'd rather have spent the whole time listening to him than watching the lost episodes.Really, other than Ren Seeks Help, these episodes are some pretty weak tea, and that's being kind.  I boggle at some of the 5-star reviews and look at them suspiciously.  I have a very hard time believing that anyone who doesn't work for the publisher would give these discs the best possible grade.  Sorry, I find that unlikely.

985995,A16PEMNNXMO1UQ,B000F9T700,"Butch Ediocy ""sleepyeyedplumber""","[18, 25]","Well, guys, here's the scoop on the Lost Episodes DVD set:All 9 half-hours of the show on a 2-disc setVideo: 1:33:1Audio: Dolby 2.0/CCExtras:-Intros by John K. and Wierd Al-Interviews with the Top Artists-Cow and Chicken Creator David Feiss Interview-Clips of Unfinished Cartoons-17 APC Animatics-3 Naked Beach Frenzy Pencil Tests-APC Model Sheet and Background Art-Rough Cut-Ren Seeks HelpRen and Stimpy, as Mr. Burns from the Simpsons would describe, ""has quite a long and colorful history"". It was ressurrected as an adult cartoon on SpikeTV in June of 2003 when four out of nine half-hour episodes had aired as part of a late-night block alongside GARY THE RAT and (shudder) STRIPPERELLA. John K. mentioned in the promo commercials that the premise of the new Ren and Stimpy is that you can do almost anything without having to worry about censorship values. Well, apparently that's where he went wrong.There are a few changes you will notice here in this new adult cartoon:First, the artwork and animation has improved over the original show. After all, after a decade's worth of TV and Flash-animated cartoons, John K. and his crew had enough experience under their belts. Second, Billy West doesn't return to play the role of Stimpy. Eric Bauza takes his place, and does play a pretty damn good voice of Stimpy.Now on to the episodes:The first one, ONWARD AND UPWARD, was inspired by fan letters who wanted to see an entire episode of gross-out gags. Yet, this episode recieved so many angry online comments stating that their favorite childhood characters just turned to [...]. It seemed pretty obvious Spike aired the weakest episode first.However, the show got it's mojo with the second episode, REN SEEKS HELP, which explore's Ren's youth as Ren tries to figure out why is he so mean and insane. The third one, FIREDOGS 2, while not as funny as the second, brought the famous cartoonist Ralph Bakshi into the animated world.These were all Nickelodeon-underdeveloped ideas, though; in other words, they were just old stories never brought up when Spumco was working for R&S; on Nickelodeon. The new ideas, or rather the five remaining episodes (four of which are two-parter episodes), proved too risque to actually AIR on television. NAKED BEACH FRENZY, especially showed some material that even South Park couldn't top with 30 minutes of half-naked women on the beach; ALTRUISTS has the most funny and risque gags than any other R&S; episode; and STIMPY'S PREGNANT displayed the first-ever onscreen natural childbirth and...well, you get the rest.Nonetheless, with these entertaining (both aired and unaired) episodes, this 2-disc set is no doubt gonna sell like hot cakes--probably even more than the original show's DVD sets, and we'd all be in prayer of a Direct-to-DVD ressurrection for Ren and Stimpy.And it's all thanks to the DVD market.

In 2004 when Spike TV bought the rights to Ren & Stimpy writer, director, creator, and animator John K. approached Spike's CEO's. Throughout the myriad of fan-mail he'd received from as far back as the early 90's when the show premiered some ideas were presented to John K. from fans for episodes. John K. also took it upon himself to throw some episode scripts he'd held onto that Nickelodeon had found ""too extreme"" for their audiences. With the green light from Spike TV and lee-way to do absolutely whatever he wanted, John K. inevitably...went to an even higher extreme.Viewer beware...Your mind will not make it out of a single episode intact.All around an amazingly well done collection featuring one-on-one interviews with John K. himself introducing each episode. Each interview adds unparalleled depth to the already endeared show and the history behind its origins and creator. Pack that with the six episodes made for Spike TV in their raw and absolutely uncensored format (they show it ALL...I'm not kidding folks) and you're in for a total mind-frag.Though lacking in other special features the interviews and episodes speak for themselves. All around a great collection. My vote: (If you're a fan) definitely a buy. If you've never seen the show and are looking to get into it you may want to watch some of the original show first, which you can find here on Amazon easily.

985999,A1ZSOK69XSXF73,B000F9T700,"Duckman ""Morbid Cynic""","[5, 9]","First of all, I'd like to say that I LOVE Ren and Stimpy.  I've been a fan since the early 90's and when I heard that there were new episodes coming out on Spike TV in 2003 back in the summer of 2002, I was absolutely thrilled.  A year passes by and the big night appears; new episodes of Ren and Stimpy have finally come.  I guess because of the hype and my immaturity back then, I actually thought the episodes were good.  Fast forward three years later and when I heard that those episodes were released on DVD as the ""Lost Episodes"" AND they included episodes that were too ""hot"" for cable TV.  Again, I ate it up.  However, looking at those episodes now, I'm rather ashamed of myself for my opinions in the past.Looking at these episodes now, I realize they have practically none of the charm that the older Ren and Stimpy episodes have had.  The ""classic"" Ren and Stimpy episodes were exercises in sheer visual and mental insanity coupled with proper usage of ""gross out"" humor, which gave Ren and Stimpy the charm we grew up with and love.  The new episodes are merely exercises in overdone ""gross out"" humor coupled with abuse of profanity since they were on a cable channel for more adult audiences.  Take a look at the classic episode ""Stimpy's Invention.""  It wasn't that gross, but boy was it INSANE.  It had Ren and Stimpy move like jello while bouncing their butts together singing along to a really weird song (""Happy Happy, Joy Joy"") AND has Ren smashing his Happy Helmet with a ball-peen hammer.With the exception of ""Ren Seeks Help,"" all of that insanity is gone in the new episodes.  ""Onward and Upward,"" the first ""new"" Ren and Stimpy episode, is only an excercise in profanity and having us gag while Ren and Stimpy munch on the delightful things flung into a bar spittoon such as boogers and vomit; not to mention crass humor about Ren and Stimpy being homosexual.  Looking at this episode now, I barely giggled.  ""Ren Seeks Help"" is the only decent episode on this collection because it dwelled on Ren's insanity and utilized the ""messed up"" background art that were so prevalent in the ""classic"" episodes.  Other ""new"" episodes like ""Naked Beach Frenzy"" and ""Stimpy's Pregnant"" play up the whole ""offensive humor"" factor since the former dwells on female nudity while the latter dwells on sickening the viewer (particularly towards the end when Mr. Horse finds out that Stimpy isn't pregant; he's constipated).At the end of the day, it's really no surprise why these are ""lost episodes"" of Ren and Stimpy.  Go get yourself the DVD volumes of the ""classic"" Ren and Stimpy episodes if you haven't already; heck, the Games Animation episodes of Ren and Stimpy are lightyears better than the ""Lost Episodes.""",2,"Looks good on paper, but is lousy when executed.  32%",1263081600,"01 10, 2010",2010,2728,"['First', ""'d"", 'like', 'say', 'LOVE', 'Ren', 'Stimpy', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'early', '90', 'when', 'heard', 'were', 'new', 'episodes', 'coming', 'out', 'Spike', 'TV', '2003', 'back', 'summer', '2002', 'was', 'absolutely', 'thrilled', 'year', 'passes', 'big', 'night', 'new', 'episodes', 'Ren', 'Stimpy', 'have', 'finally', 'come', 'guess', 'hype', 'immaturity', 'back', 'then', 'actually', 'thought', 'episodes', 'were', 'good', 'Fast', 'forward', 'three', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'heard', 'episodes', 'were', 'released', 'DVD', 'Lost', 'Episodes', 'included', 'episodes', 'were', 'too', 'hot', 'cable', 'TV', 'Again', 'ate', 'up', 'However', 'looking', 'episodes', 'now', ""'m"", 'rather', 'ashamed', 'myself', 'opinions', 'past.Looking', 'episodes', 'now', 'realize', 'have', 'practically', 'none', 'charm', 'older', 'Ren', 'Stimpy', 'episodes', 'have', 'had', 'classic', 'Ren', 'Stimpy', 'episodes', 'were', 'exercises', 'sheer', 'visual', 'mental', 'insanity', 'coupled', 'proper', 'usage', 'gross', 'out', 'humor', 'gave', 'Ren', 'Stimpy', 'charm', 'grew', 'up', 'love', 'new', 'episodes', 'are', 'merely', 'exercises', 'overdone', 'gross', 'out', 'humor', 'coupled', 'abuse', 'profanity', 'were', 'cable', 'channel', 'more', 'adult', 'audiences', 'Take', 'look', 'classic', 'episode', 'Stimpy', 'Invention', 'was', ""n't"", 'gross', 'boy', 'was', 'INSANE', 'had', 'Ren', 'Stimpy', 'move', 'jello', 'bouncing', 'butts', 'together', 'singing', 'along', 'really', 'weird', 'song', 'Happy', 'Happy', 'Joy', 'Joy', 'AND', 'Ren', 'smashing', 'Happy', 'Helmet', 'ball-peen', 'hammer.With', 'exception', 'Ren', 'Seeks', 'Help', 'insanity', 'gone', 'new', 'episodes', 'Onward', 'Upward', 'first', 'new', 'Ren', 'Stimpy', 'episode', 'only', 'excercise', 'profanity', 'having', 'gag', 'Ren', 'Stimpy', 'munch', 'delightful', 'things', 'flung', 'bar', 'spittoon', 'such', 'boogers', 'vomit', 'not', 'mention', 'crass', 'humor', 'Ren', 'Stimpy', 'being', 'homosexual', 'Looking', 'episode', 'now', 'barely', 'giggled', 'Ren', 'Seeks', 'Help', 'only', 'decent', 'episode', 'collection', 'dwelled', 'Ren', 'insanity', 'utilized', 'messed', 'up', 'art', 'were', 'so', 'prevalent', 'classic', 'episodes', 'Other', 'new', 'episodes', 'Naked', 'Beach', 'Frenzy', 'Stimpy', 'Pregnant', 'play', 'up', 'whole', 'offensive', 'humor', 'factor', 'former', 'dwells', 'female', 'nudity', 'latter', 'dwells', 'sickening', 'viewer', 'particularly', 'end', 'when', 'Mr', 'Horse', 'out', 'Stimpy', ""n't"", 'pregant', 'constipated', 'end', 'day', 'really', 'surprise', 'why', 'are', 'lost', 'episodes', 'Ren', 'Stimpy', 'Go', 'get', 'DVD', 'volumes', 'classic', 'Ren', 'Stimpy', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'heck', 'Games', 'Animation', 'episodes', 'Ren', 'Stimpy', 'are', 'better', 'Lost', 'Episodes']",Ren & Stimpy - The Lost Episodes

If you are not into adult humor then I would fully recommend that you stay away from this series. If you are sick, disturbed and perverted, then you have found your cartoon source. These episodes are not, and I repeat not!!, recommend for children. These episodes have the cast swearing and women's nipples are flying around everywhere! I've said it before and I will say it again, this is not for children at all!The special features are fairly interesting, but get old over time and there isn't much variety. What I do like is the introduction to the DVD by Weird Al and John K. John K does a great job on each episode introduction that he also does. He tells the inspiration and people behind the stories. Almost every other extra wasn't that interesting, they all have more interviews from the crew but they just aren't that interesting. It is mainly just giggling and not saying anything important or nothing new that John K. hasn't already said.

For those of you who don't know the history, John K. was fired after the second season for pushing the limits and ruffling the feathers of the network executives... who owned the rights to the show and the characters.  They hired new people, toned down the shows and the quality dropped.About 3 years ago, Spike picked up the contract and asked him to produce about a dozen or so new shows... some of which were never aired because of the censorship issues raised by the Janet Jackson Superbowl mess.Anyhow, Spike just released a compilation of about 6 of these little gems and I just watched the first episode and all I can say is WOW!  Ren & Stimpy were groundbreaking in the early 90s, but they were held back by Nickelodeon, the network that originally aired them.Without giving away too much plot, In one particular episode, Ren & Stimpy spend the day at the beach staring at naked women and they manage to become bathroom attendants who gladly lather up the women in the showers.  Unlike the original shows, which broke ground with simple bathroom and booger jokes.  These shows are completely adult oriented and they make no attempt to target anyone but adults... men specifically.  In fact, in the introduction to the DVD from Weird Al Yankovic, he mentions at least 3 times that his wife HATES these shows.So be warned, these are NOT the cute little characters you knew 15 years ago.

986005,ADF5Q9UJ6FWOC,B000F9T700,Lil' E,"[33, 46]","As a kid, I grew up with Ren and Stimpy, which aired on Nickelodeon. Because that is a young adult/children's channel, Ren and Stimpy had to be molded into the image of a relatively appropriate show. And I think because of this censorship, the show was actually able to become so iconic. It is easy to be blatant and crude, but when you have to work around certain obstacles to get your point across, that is when things become more interesting, and more creative. The beauty of the Ren and Stimpy episodes aired on Nickelodeon was the fact that they could still manage to be hilariously crude, but it was on a level where kids wouldn't get it, while adults would and could laugh and think ""Hey, that's really clever. Stupid, but clever."" With that in mind, if you take away the need to overcome the obstacle of portraying a message without infringing on the censorship rules, you take away the essence and creativity of Ren and Stimpy. And that is basically what is happening with ""The Lost Episodes"". I watched one and it was decidedly not worth my time. They are extremely crude, uncreative, and uninspired. Even the introduction by the creators was drab. Though, I will admit, there were a few times I laughed. I could see someone watching it with their friends just to laugh at how ridiculous and different it is. Sort of like a ""Oh my goodness, this is so bad!"" kind of laughter. I would not recommend this DVD if you are a hardcore fan of the ""old"" Ren and Stimpy. This DVD encompasses nothing of the great past episodes. It's just a collection of very adult situations, a poorly executed experimentation with how weird and estranging the creators could make Ren and Stimpy, both the characters and the show itself.

This collection of ""Lost"" episodes features six episodes where Ren & Stimpy get revamped with all the grossness, nudity, and insane antics that the show was always meant to have, and even though at times it can get to be too much for it's own good, this DVD set is a must own for those who fondly remember this gruesome twosome.  In these episodes, Ren & Stimpy go to a beach filled with voluptuous young girls who like to get naked, try to help out a homeless widow (an homage to the Three Stooges), get in over their heads with an insane fire chief, and look to move out of the bum's mouth that they've been living in.  Stimpy is also pregnant with Ren's love child (the results of which are hysterical, to me anyway, others may find it to be way too much), and Ren goes to a shrink to reveal the origin of his violent ways.  There's interviews and introductions aplenty with John K. and a few others, which are more than worth the price of admission alone.

986008,AP9LTXNHPI42F,B000F9T700,NorthernBelle,"[3, 4]","If you love Ren & Stimpy for the reasons I do you may find my review helpful. I became a fan of Ren Hoek back in the 90s because he is evil and nasty and because he is tromped on. I am also a fan of some of the Games Animation episodes, which were made without John K, because they continued to humorously exploit Ren's evil/oppressed nature.REN SEEKS HELP is a success. ALTRUISTS and STIMPY'S PREGNANT, while not containing what I traditionally like about Ren & Stimpy, are nonetheless entertaining. NAKED BEACH FRENZY, ONWARDS AND UPWARDS, and FIRE DOGS are flops.ALTRUISTS - As John K says, the Three Stooges are a big influence here. Contains some clever ironies and is fun to watch. Some of the material harkens back to the earlier episodes. And I like seeing Ren care about someone on occasion.FIRE DOGS - Is entirely about a fat, hairy lummox. Fans who disliked the Games Animation episodes complained that Ren & Stimpy were two-dimensional and too inactive in them; yet, what are they in this? Ren and Stimpy are basically passive here, looking like children being led along by the hand as they wander wide-eyed through the creature's disgusting world of filth. Perhaps this is proof that John K's contribution to the series was overrated. If a bulging beast is your cup of tea, then you'll love this one. For me, laughing and vomiting do not go hand in hand.NAKED BEACH FRENZY - Not so much offensive as totally unfunny. Unlike FIRE DOGS and ONWARD AND UPWARD, can be watched while eating. Since when is bouncing cleavage funny? John, you can do so much better. Why go to lengths elsewhere on the DVD to show us that Ren & Stimpy are gay and then show them oogling naked women?ONWARD AND UPWARD - This is where John K lets it be known with certainty that Ren and Stimpy are gay. I preferred the episodes of yesteryear where the homosexuality was only implied and one was left to wonder about it, unlike now where it is literally spelled out on a chalkboard. I like to think of Ren and Stimpy as hapless chums who met up on the road of life and chose stay together out of resignation. The cartoon is gross-out and not funny. I'd rather watch AN ABE DIVIDED and see Ren treated like a booger than see him eat a booger.REN SEEKS HELP - Now this is the Ren I know and love! This episode alone makes the DVD worth buying and owning. Here we see Ren in his (very) evil mode and we learn the origins of his cruelty. We also meet his parents for the first time. The episode opens with Ren having done something so terrible to Stimpy that Ren has crossed the line this time and Stimpy will not forgive him. So off Ren goes to the psychiatrist (played by Mr. Horse) to get help and to recount in detail the horrific things he did in his youthful, preStimpy days. Seeing a mangled amphibian hobbling around on crutches, yelling at Ren to ""Finish me off, you bastard!"" really made me laugh. Add a new Ren & Stimpy character to my favorites: Mr. Frog! It would be great to see Mr. Frog in future episodes, although that is probably not possible since Ren admits to never having heard about Mr. Frog again since his childhood and since Mr. Frog appears to take matters into his own hands at the end, doing what Ren refused to do. Ren does something at the doctor's office to one of the orderlies that is so unexpectedly shocking and gruesome it makes you question if you ever realized just how psychotic he is.STIMPY'S PREGNANT - Pays homage to I LOVE LUCY and contains cute ""audience applause."" And is the ending a nod to Mr. Hankey? Ren is a macho pig with his dutiful and dim-witted ""wife"" hurdling obstacles like an Olympic athlete in order to satisfy Ren's every whim. Maybe I liked this episode because I've known couples like this in real life. It made me smile and the next time I see Ren getting ripped to shreds in a beef jerky machine I'll enjoy it all the more.The profanity throughout is not excessive, but I would have liked to have heard ""you bloated sack of protoplasm!"" at least once instead of the ""F"" word. ""Bloated sack"" is memorable and unique. The ""F"" word is not.Interview-style commentaries from the creators precede each episode and the disks contain preliminary sketchings of the cartoons for those interested.

John K. and other commentaries from the shows creators are very detailed. These are people who make cartoons out of a sheer love for the old craft. And it's good to see that I am not the only one who enjoys real animation and not this market driven 3D garbage that's passing for art these days. This said, the episodes I found were too few. Naked Beach Party of course is very adult, more ranchy than funny but funny nontheless. The other episodes seemed funnier. I certainly hope John K. makes more of these cartoons even if he has to send them to the direct to video circuit. There are simply few cartoons aimed towards adults who enjoy animation and not necessarily anime which has become a tired genre as most of it is aimed low for the kiddy market. Keep John K.

You grew up watching George Carlin and you have read Lenny Bruce'sHow to Talk Dirty and Influence Peopleand you believe that comedians should not have limitations. Then you venture into a comedy club and find yourself subjected to gay jokes and rampant hostility for the time that you can stay with it.That's pretty much the experience of watching this show. Ren & Stimpy had an unbelievable run as the show that you couldn't believe anyone could get away with. It was weird and funny and entertaining. This version is none of those things. It's like the creator spent his entire time writing the show wishing that he could indulge in all of his sex jokes. And when he finally could do that, he would keep them coming as long as possible.And that's the problem. Almost every joke is about nudity or a newly horny Ren indulging in sexual single entendre. if you think that ejaculation is automatically funny, then this is the DVD for you. It leaves no sad sex joke untouched. Gay panic, body hair and creepy shower stalking are all jokes that were much funnier when Porky's did them.Even worse, the writer insists on introducing every single cartoon with self-indulgent babble about what went into the cartoon. The introductions would normally be intolerable but with cartoons this unfunny, they are almost the best part of the show.If you have ever liked Ren & Stimpy, forget this thing exists.
