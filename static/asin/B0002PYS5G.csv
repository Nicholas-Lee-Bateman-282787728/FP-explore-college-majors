842884,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B0002PYS5G,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[5, 5]","I can still remember seeing ads for this show 7 years ago, and I can't believe that this show has been on that long.  Don't get me wrong, this show is hilarious, probably one of my favorite comedy shows (although based on what's out there, there aren't too many truly great comedies).  It's just that I never thought that a period show such as this could ever become so popular.The show centers around Eric Forman (Topher Grace), a 17-year-old living in 1976 Point Place, Wicsonsin.  Eric, along with his friends Hyde (Danny Masterson) and Kelso (Ashton Kutcher), his best friend/girlfriend Donna (Laura Prepon), Kelso's on-again/off-again girlfriend Jackie (Mila Kunis), and a foreign exchange student nicknamed Fez (Wilmer Valderama) go around town in an Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser stopping at discos, hanging out at burger places, and going to see Star Wars.  Meanwhile, they try to avoid their quoirky parents.  Eric has Red (Kurtwood Smith) and Kitty (Debra Jo Rupp), two people who prove that there is truth behind the saying ""opposites attract"".  Red is short-tempered and conservative, while Kitty is a loving and passive woman.  And Donna has to deal with Bob (Don Stark) and Midge (Tanya Roberts).  Bob is an old-fashioned (read: somewhat mysogonistic) guy and Midge is a very dull (yet very attractive) girl who gets wrapped up in every fad just for the fun of it (she joins feminism groups to fit it, much to the chagrin of Donna, who truly believes in feminism and the Equal Rights Amendment).The gang gets involved in a bunch of crazy situations, such as the time they decide to go streaking at a Ford for President rally, when they decide to throw a keggar in an empty swimming pool, their trip to Jackie's remote ski lodge, or their outing to a WWF match.  About half of the humor comes from the setting (there is a lot to poke fun at in the 70's), while the other half comes from the characters themselves.  Whether it be Kelso's stupidity, Jackie's shallowness, Red's curtness, or Eric's cluelessness, there's a lot of fun to be had with this group.One of the cool things about this show was that a lot of big names from the 70's showed up to do guest spots.  This season, Danny Bonaduci shows up as Eric's boss in one episode, but as the seasons go on, we will be treated to Ted Nugent, Alice Cooper, and even Tommy Chong (who becomes a regular castmember).This show is particularly strong for its first season; while it would go on to have some really great episodes, I had forgotten just how funny these early episodes were.  One of my favorite episodes of the series is ""A New Hope"", which is about the gang going to see Star Wars.  And while the show would definitely go on to become better, it was by no means bad this year.As someone who's been a fan of the show since it came on, it was great to see the beginnings again, and to see how the show has changed.  While we get to see the origins of amazing running gags, such as the single camera panning around circular tables while characters were eating or ""relaxing"", we also get to see old gags that were discontinued at some point, such as the mock videos that parody educational and training tapes of the time.The one problem that I do have with this boxed set isn't even the fault of the show; it is the fault of the producers of the DVD set.  For some reason, FOX aired a a few episodes from the middle of the season later in the year, and the episodes are in order of air-date on this set, as opposed to the order of production/continuity.  While this show isn't very arc-heavy, and for the most part can be seen out of order, there is a continuity to it, and the episode order on Disc 4 is a little off.  The last three episodes of the season were ""A New Hope"", ""Hyde Moves In"", and ""The Good Son"".  However, a few middle-of-the-season episodes were placed in between those three episodes on Disc 4.  Strangely, this is one of the few DVD sets that arranges episodes by air-date rather than by continuity's order.  Even shows like Arrested Development and Firefly (both of which are also FOX DVDs), which were aired out of order, have their episodes arranged correctly (although episode order is much more important for those two shows).  But while I would have preferred the correct order, it doesn't take too much away from the overall set, since the show doesn't depend too much on the arcs (at least not yet anyway).As I said, this is a great show.  While it isn't as witty or clever as Arrested Development, it is far better than most of the comedy shows that appear on television.  If you've never seen the show before, you should consider checking it out.  Unlike certain shows, I could reccomend this as a ""blind buy"".

842896,A2XWU6Y8PF8L17,B0002PYS5G,"CreepyT ""CreepyTendencies""","[27, 33]","Eric Forman (Topher Grace) and his friends are growing up in an era of change, mysticism, intrigue, and eclecticism, and this television retro-comedy documents their misadventures and mischief. Hyde (Danny Masterson) is probably the most laid back of the bunch, preferring a simple approach to life, while the odd undertakings of Kelso (Ashton Kutcher) serve as comic relief throughout the season's entirety.  Donna (Lora Prepon) is the more conservative book-worm of the group, as well as Eric's girlfriend. Jackie (Mila Kunis), Kelso's girlfriend, is the girl with the snobby, egocentric viewpoint whom everyone loves to hate.  Meanwhile, foreign exchange student Fez (Wilmer Valderrama) is not only trying to find his place in the era and world, as is every teenager, but also his place in a new country.  Together they are on a perpetual quest for beer, the infinite wisdom to found in the pot-smoking circle, and all around good times.In addition to Eric's cast of friends, the show also involves Eric's parents Red and Kitty (Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp).  As is true for any parents, no matter what decade, there are differing viewpoints and philosophies that come into play.  Though set in the 70's, the dilemmas presented and the issues posed (not merely with regards to the ""parental units"") are relevant to teenagers and young adults of any decade, regardless of the current fashion and music trends.I must admit that when this show first came out I did not give it the chance it deserved.  I pretty much despise most of what came out of the 70's and figured that a show set during that decade would not appeal to me.  Thus, I never watched even a single episode up until the show's fifth season.  Now, however, I'm hooked.  I'm so glad these are coming out on DVD.  Therefore, even though I missed the first few seasons I can still catch up on the odd ventures of Eric Forman and his band of friends.Tacky clothing and interior decorating aside, the charisma between the cast is excellent and the writing is lighthearted and humorous.  As with any television show, there are some episodes that are much better than other episodes.  Sometimes the dim-wittedness of Kelso seems a little over-the-top, and there are times when Jackie's character gets a little too irritating (though both pull off their roles quite well nonetheless).  However, overall it's a great show that makes for a pleasurable viewing experience.Though the DVD extras on this set leave something to be desired, it's still well worth it to be able to watch the shows sequentially, on your own time, and without commercials.I watch very little television at all, but when I'm in the mood for some blithe humor I turn to That 70's Show.  This show definitely ranks up there among my favorites, and I look forward to the release of the remaining seasons on DVD as well.",4,"""We're ALL all right!""",1103241600,"12 17, 2004",2004,2851,"['Eric', 'Forman', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'friends', 'are', 'growing', 'up', 'era', 'change', 'mysticism', 'intrigue', 'eclecticism', 'television', 'retro-comedy', 'documents', 'misadventures', 'mischief', 'Hyde', 'Danny', 'Masterson', 'probably', 'most', 'laid', 'back', 'bunch', 'preferring', 'simple', 'approach', 'life', 'odd', 'undertakings', 'Kelso', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'serve', 'comic', 'relief', 'season', 'entirety', 'Donna', 'Lora', 'Prepon', 'more', 'conservative', 'book-worm', 'group', 'as', 'well', 'Eric', 'girlfriend', 'Jackie', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'Kelso', 'girlfriend', 'girl', 'snobby', 'egocentric', 'viewpoint', 'whom', 'everyone', 'hate', 'Meanwhile', 'foreign', 'exchange', 'student', 'Fez', 'Wilmer', 'Valderrama', 'not', 'only', 'trying', 'find', 'place', 'era', 'world', 'teenager', 'also', 'place', 'new', 'country', 'are', 'perpetual', 'quest', 'beer', 'infinite', 'wisdom', 'found', 'pot-smoking', 'circle', 'around', 'good', 'times.In', 'addition', 'Eric', 'cast', 'friends', 'show', 'also', 'Eric', 'parents', 'Red', 'Kitty', 'Kurtwood', 'Smith', 'Debra', 'Jo', 'Rupp', 'true', 'parents', 'matter', 'what', 'decade', 'are', 'differing', 'viewpoints', 'philosophies', 'come', 'play', 'Though', 'set', '70', 'dilemmas', 'presented', 'issues', 'posed', 'not', 'merely', 'regards', 'parental', 'units', 'are', 'relevant', 'teenagers', 'young', 'adults', 'decade', 'regardless', 'current', 'fashion', 'music', 'trends.I', 'must', 'admit', 'when', 'show', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'chance', 'deserved', 'pretty', 'much', 'despise', 'most', 'what', 'came', 'out', '70', 'figured', 'show', 'set', 'decade', 'would', 'not', 'appeal', 'Thus', 'never', 'watched', 'even', 'single', 'episode', 'show', 'fifth', 'season', 'Now', 'however', ""'m"", 'hooked', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'are', 'coming', 'out', 'DVD', 'Therefore', 'even', 'missed', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'can', 'still', 'catch', 'up', 'odd', 'ventures', 'Eric', 'Forman', 'band', 'friends.Tacky', 'clothing', 'interior', 'decorating', 'aside', 'charisma', 'cast', 'excellent', 'writing', 'lighthearted', 'humorous', 'television', 'show', 'are', 'episodes', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'other', 'episodes', 'Sometimes', 'dim-wittedness', 'Kelso', 'little', 'over-the-top', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'Jackie', 'character', 'little', 'too', 'irritating', 'pull', 'off', 'roles', 'quite', 'well', 'nonetheless', 'However', 'overall', 'great', 'show', 'pleasurable', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'extras', 'set', 'leave', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'still', 'well', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'shows', 'sequentially', 'own', 'time', 'commercials.I', 'watch', 'very', 'little', 'television', 'when', ""'m"", 'mood', 'blithe', 'humor', 'turn', '70', 'Show', 'show', 'definitely', 'there', 'favorites', 'look', 'forward', 'release', 'remaining', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'as', 'well']",That '70s Show: Season 1

Great music, great clothes, great characters, and great actors equal a great show. I hope all the original music is on there though.

842904,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,B0002PYS5G,General Breadbasket,"[0, 2]","I'm a pretty big fan of ""That '70s Show"". It's got some unique ideas, wacky humour, warmth and a great commeraderie between the cast. You can tell both the actors and the characters they play are friends. Though I didn't grow up during the decade, I like all things 1970s and enjoy seeing all the cultural references too.The show, basically, is all about a group of teenagers living the 1970s in the fictional suburb of Point Place, Wisconcin. There's Foreman, the awkward and most mild mannered one, Donna, his pretty tomboy neighbour, Hyde, the rebellious one immersed in the counter culture of the time, Kelso, the handsome yet airheaded guy and his bossy girlfriend Jackie. There's also Fez, the misunderstood foreign exchange student. Together, they try and keep themselves amused. They hang around in Foreman's basement, they go out in Foreman's Vista Cruiser. They take a lot of advantage of Foreman, actually.The first series is 25 episodes long, and is presented in this DVD set over four discs. It establishes the style and characters of the series, really well, I thought. Episodes within the series that are worth a mention include ""That '70s Pilot"", where Foreman first gets his beloved car, and the budding and breaking relationships are introduced, ""Streaking"", where the guys decide to streak at the Point Place stop of Gerry Ford's campaign trail, ""A New Hope"" where the gang all get to see Star Wars, which they start applying metaphorically to their life, ""Punk Chick"" where Hyde falls for a punk girl, ""Hyde Moves In"" where Hyde's mother runs off and he finds himself living a Foreman's house. A rather major plot point for the series, actually, as it changes the setup for the show a little.All the episodes are great, though. It's fun, it's colourful, it's quotable, and it's interesting to watch the characters and relationships develop.Special features include a featurette about the first series with interviews with the cast, a trivia feature, and a montage of TV spots.For fans of comedy and of the 1970s, this is definitely worth a look.

I didn't know anyone who was as promiscuous as the characters, or crazy enough to do things in their parent's houses while their parents were upstairs, but maybe that is because there aren't any basements where I come from. There were however lots and lots of parties.The characters to me are amalgamations of people I knew. Almost every situation the group gets into, someone I knew managed to get into also.So why is that so funny? Because it's good to look back at your own stupidity through the veil of years, enough time for it to be just funny and no longer painful.Why does this show work for so many seasons? The cast has said it is because there is only one director for the whole series, making for consistent portrayal and story lines. The characters literally grow up on the show, though of course the weakness of any show about teens is that they try to have young looking adults play teens, it goes kind of sour by the end if you take things too serious.So is a perfect show? Well not quite, the laugh track is annoying; the story is awkward the first season as the characters are being developed, like in ""Happy Days"" one sibling disappears after only one episode, in one season, (Like in ""Rose Ann"") a major character changes actresses, and changes back the next season, and by the last season the performances become stilted as the adult actors are getting too old to play the characters. Do any of those things keep my wife and me from watching the shows over and over? No they don't.

842909,A3GXWR1H01ZDKI,B0002PYS5G,"J. Ashton ""Just a Grunt""","[4, 5]","And nostalgia for the 1970s is in full swing. One could probably trace the nostalgia to the 1993 release of the movie ""Dazed and Confused."" Given the superb quality of that movie and the ensuing nostalgia for the ""me"" decade, it was inevitable that network television would attempt to cash in. The result was the superbly crafted ""That 70s Show."" Set in a Wisconsin suburb, T7S follows the life and times of Eric Forman, a high school junior. Though decade specific, T7S explores themes common to many adolescents: the first car, the first love, high school, overbearing fathers, overdoting mothers, overindulging, and underachieving.The seasons progressed well and the show was at its zenith in seasons 2-4. That in and of itself speaks to the quality of the production and acting in that it is hard to maintain a peak for more than one season in episodic television and nearly impossible on a sitcom.By season 5, the show started to lose some steam because the actors had all grown out of their roles: it's hard to play 19 forever.As far as the DVD release is concerned, the episodes are all intact, but the music in many cases has been substituted. This is a disappointment, especially when one considers that Miami Vice in its first two releases went to the trouble of obtaining music rights to all its shows prior to the DVDs being burned.For example: In the pilot for T7S, only one of the 6 songs used in the episode is utilized. As good as the show was on its own merits, this seriously detracts from the quality.That being said, the show's writing and acting as well as the production and direction make the purchase worthwhile.Enjoy!!!",4,So it's 1998...,1144713600,"04 11, 2006",2006,1644,"['nostalgia', '1970s', 'full', 'swing', 'One', 'could', 'probably', 'trace', 'nostalgia', '1993', 'release', 'movie', 'Dazed', 'Confused', 'superb', 'quality', 'movie', 'ensuing', 'nostalgia', 'decade', 'was', 'inevitable', 'network', 'television', 'would', 'attempt', 'cash', 'result', 'was', 'superbly', 'crafted', '70s', 'Show', 'Set', 'Wisconsin', 'suburb', 'T7S', 'life', 'times', 'Eric', 'Forman', 'high', 'school', 'junior', 'decade', 'specific', 'T7S', 'themes', 'common', 'many', 'adolescents', 'first', 'car', 'first', 'love', 'high', 'school', 'overbearing', 'fathers', 'overdoting', 'mothers', 'overindulging', 'underachieving.The', 'seasons', 'progressed', 'well', 'show', 'was', 'zenith', 'seasons', '2-4', 'quality', 'production', 'acting', 'hard', 'maintain', 'peak', 'more', 'one', 'season', 'episodic', 'television', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'sitcom.By', 'season', '5', 'show', 'started', 'lose', 'steam', 'actors', 'had', 'grown', 'roles', 'hard', 'play', '19', 'forever.As', 'far', 'DVD', 'release', 'concerned', 'episodes', 'are', 'intact', 'music', 'many', 'cases', 'been', 'substituted', 'disappointment', 'especially', 'when', 'one', 'considers', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'first', 'two', 'releases', 'went', 'trouble', 'obtaining', 'music', 'rights', 'shows', 'prior', 'DVDs', 'being', 'burned.For', 'example', 'pilot', 'T7S', 'only', 'one', '6', 'songs', 'used', 'episode', 'utilized', 'As', 'good', 'show', 'was', 'own', 'merits', 'seriously', 'quality.That', 'being', 'said', 'show', 'writing', 'acting', 'as', 'well', 'production', 'direction', 'make', 'purchase', 'worthwhile.Enjoy']",That '70s Show: Season 1

What kept the show going is that it got better and the cast has chemestry. It's funny that the show is still on though since it technically shouldn't be the 70's anymore. When the show started Eric (Topher Grace) saw StarWars and became a huge fan. So that would be 1977 and the show was on much longer than 3 years. They should be in the 80's by now lol.Also the show shouldn't even be on without Topher Grace. The first few seasons is a coming of age story about Eric and Donna, so who wants to see her with that new unfunny guy ?? The show should've ended once Topher left. Then Ashton Kutchner left as well thinking that he also has talent in hollywood. Topher is doing Spiderman 3 as a main villian and all Ashton is doing is making is bad comedies. So I could see why Topher left but not Ashton.The show still manages to get some laughs but with Topher gone the show has no soul left. It's lame how they hang-out in his basement still...when he's not even around. On  top of it Donna hangs with her new b/f in Eric's house and kisses him in front of Eric's mom. It should bug anyone who followed the show from the start. So although I always loved the show it shouldn't even be on anymore. You're better off just either buying the dvds of the earier Topher Grace seasons or just wtaching the re-runs on FX. From the start it was about Eric and Donna and now we have to suffer through Donna and....Randy ? Eric and Donna should've just got married...the end.

As someone who was about the same age as the characters, in 1975's Minnesota, it piqued my interest and ultimately brought to America's attention as good an comedy cast as has been available in any sitcom in the last 20 years.  All 25 episodes, plus an overview are available on the DVD, but the makers were hoping against hope for another season, not realizing they'd made a franchise....thus the DVD extras for the first season are lacking.The cast, all unknowns at the time, was refreshingly funny and eager to please.  Season One also had a number of cameos from past family sitcoms from the 70's (enter Danny Bonaduce, etc.).Topher Grace and Laura Prepon, as Eric and Donna, are the most believable as young people who love each other.  Everyone else plays pure comedy, and their timing is delightful, particularly Don Stark and Tanya Roberts as Donna's parents.  The episode ""The Prom"" continuously tugs at your heartstrings and stands out as the best of the season.An unexpected hit, reliving Season One of ""That 70's Show"" willopen your eyes as to why the show had such a long run.

The show revolves around the Foreman family and most of the action takes place in their home, specifically the basement where Eric (Topher Grace) and his friends hang out.

Teenagers growing up in the decade of easy drugs and free love have to deal with their parents who are (ironically) a throwback to the 1950's themselves.My favirote character is Donna Pinciotti, the tomboy living next door to 'All American' Eric Foreman (the 'Richie Cunningham' character of the series). The two families grew up together but hormones cause new feelings to emerge. As an inside joke, one of her 'hipster' parents is former Charlie's Angel Tanya Roberts (okay, Roberts joined that show in the early 1980's, but that show itself is considered a 1970's icon).Also like Happy Days, the older sibling was dumped to add an older male 'rebel' houseguest who was on hand to dispense advice to the 'squares'.My least favirote character is Michael Kelso (Ashton Kutcher). He's not as clownish as he became in the middle seasons, but it's hard to root for somebody who is intentionally made to be a buffon.The only thing I am not crazy about is the psychedelic scene transitions in the show episodes.

I would watch reruns every night and chat about the show with my friend at lunch. It was really easy to get into and follow along with the simple stories and characters. This show was relatable and appealed to my young heart. Oh I would have done anything to live back in the 70's and have a gang of friends like this. But things do change over time. No longer do I catch this on television everyday but save the DVD's for long car rides or long summer days.I own a few seasons on DVD but Season 1 is really the only one that I will watch, maybe along with Season 5, my second favorite season. I really feel like this show was our Happy Days. It started out a promising situational comedy with some nostalgia but slid downhill in quality right after the beginning. It works as a show about teenagers running into funny little problems but as it continued on the plots got stale and by the Season 8, it was an absolute mess that I like to pretend never happened. (Being a show we are free to do that... hehe.)That 70's Show starts off presenting the gang. Eric (the good boy), Hyde (the bad boy), Kelso (the pretty but dumb boy), Fez (the perverted foreign exchange student) Donna (the girl next door), and Jackie (the cheerleader). They all follow simple stereotypes we have seen before but there is something strangely loveable about them. Eric and Donna's romance is interesting enough to follow, especially in this season, and Jackie and Kelso are humorous with their on and off relationship. Eric's parents, Red and Kitty, are absolutely adorable and one of the best side aspects of the show. Some other featured character's are Donna's annoying but good hearted parents and Eric's older sister. All what we would expect from a sitcom but nothing to complain about.These Season 1 stories feel fresh, cute, and fun. They consist of many typical 70's culture such as Star Wars, disco, weed, Todd Rundgren, and feminism. The decade That 70's Show takes place in is the novelty of the program. Some of the episodes of this show still leave me feeling nostalgic and sentimental. My only real complaint is that the humor can be rather dumb and loud - but I do appreciate the creative imaginative dream sequences. It adds character to the show.In conclusion, I really love this collection of episodes. The show did quickly go downhill, I will still watch the reruns for fun, but I will forever treasure the memories of this set. It has been interesting to catch on television after my introduction to Freaks and Geeks, a more recent show set in a similar time period, that handles the decade much differently. I appreciate both shows for different reasons. That '70s Show for sugar and fun and Freaks and Geeks for realism and maturity.",4,A big part of my middle school years,1373587200,"07 12, 2013",2013,2977,"['middle', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'were', 'not', 'best', 'was', 'incredibly', 'awkward', 'had', 'limited', 'selection', 'friends', 'come', 'go', 'up', 'Senior', 'Year', 'where', 'felt', 'found', 'place', '70', 'Show', 'consisted', 'much', 'middle', 'school', 'years', 'would', 'watch', 'reruns', 'night', 'chat', 'show', 'friend', 'lunch', 'was', 'really', 'easy', 'get', 'follow', 'along', 'simple', 'stories', 'characters', 'show', 'was', 'relatable', 'appealed', 'young', 'heart', 'Oh', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'anything', 'live', 'back', '70', 'have', 'gang', 'friends', 'things', 'do', 'change', 'time', 'No', 'longer', 'do', 'catch', 'television', 'everyday', 'save', 'DVD', 'long', 'car', 'rides', 'long', 'summer', 'days.I', 'few', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'Season', '1', 'really', 'only', 'one', 'will', 'watch', 'maybe', 'Season', '5', 'second', 'favorite', 'season', 'really', 'feel', 'show', 'was', 'Happy', 'Days', 'started', 'out', 'promising', 'situational', 'comedy', 'nostalgia', 'slid', 'downhill', 'quality', 'right', 'beginning', 'show', 'teenagers', 'running', 'funny', 'little', 'problems', 'continued', 'plots', 'got', 'stale', 'Season', '8', 'was', 'absolute', 'mess', 'like', 'pretend', 'never', 'happened', 'Being', 'show', 'are', 'free', 'do', 'hehe', '70', 'Show', 'presenting', 'gang', 'Eric', 'good', 'boy', 'Hyde', 'bad', 'boy', 'Kelso', 'pretty', 'dumb', 'boy', 'Fez', 'perverted', 'foreign', 'exchange', 'student', 'Donna', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'Jackie', 'cheerleader', 'follow', 'simple', 'stereotypes', 'have', 'seen', 'something', 'strangely', 'loveable', 'Eric', 'Donna', 'romance', 'interesting', 'enough', 'follow', 'especially', 'season', 'Jackie', 'Kelso', 'are', 'humorous', 'relationship', 'Eric', 'parents', 'Red', 'Kitty', 'are', 'absolutely', 'adorable', 'one', 'best', 'side', 'aspects', 'show', 'other', 'featured', 'character', 'are', 'Donna', 'annoying', 'good', 'hearted', 'parents', 'Eric', 'older', 'sister', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'sitcom', 'nothing', 'complain', 'about.These', 'Season', '1', 'stories', 'feel', 'fresh', 'cute', 'fun', 'consist', 'many', 'typical', '70', 'culture', 'such', 'Star', 'Wars', 'disco', 'weed', 'Todd', 'Rundgren', 'feminism', 'decade', '70', 'Show', 'place', 'novelty', 'program', 'episodes', 'show', 'still', 'leave', 'feeling', 'nostalgic', 'sentimental', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'humor', 'can', 'be', 'rather', 'dumb', 'loud', 'do', 'appreciate', 'creative', 'imaginative', 'dream', 'sequences', 'character', 'show.In', 'conclusion', 'really', 'love', 'collection', 'episodes', 'show', 'did', 'quickly', 'go', 'downhill', 'will', 'still', 'watch', 'reruns', 'fun', 'will', 'forever', 'treasure', 'memories', 'set', 'been', 'interesting', 'catch', 'television', 'introduction', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'more', 'recent', 'show', 'set', 'similar', 'time', 'period', 'decade', 'much', 'differently', 'appreciate', 'shows', 'different', 'reasons', 'Show', 'sugar', 'fun', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'realism', 'maturity']",That '70s Show: Season 1
