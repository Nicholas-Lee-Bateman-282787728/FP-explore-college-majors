Flores ""htuttle""","[2, 2]","Attempting to capture history on the silver screen is always a tricky proposition, especially when you have figures as notable as the Kennedy Brothers at the center.  It is somehwhat surprising how deeply feelings about these two go, even today and their presense alone can often distract from the proceedings as many viewers will no doubt engage in the is he &quot;doing&quot; a good Kennedy question.Such issues aside the film is accused of being too slanted or historically inaccurate.  The claim does have some merit, in that Costner's character is elevated to a status he may not have had and the Vice-President is nowhere to be seen.  What must be noted in the film's defense is that the majority of the dialogue and interactions are based or transcribed directly from the 100+ hours of recently de-clasified audio-recordings made during the proceedings at the White House durring the events portrayed and from interviews and memoirs from the key players.  At the very least the film tries to create as much truth as it can, using actual materials where it can (The Photographs of the misele sites are the actual photopgraphs).  If it bends slightly too much in it's slant in the name of drama, it can usually be forgiven because the overall goal, to illustrate the dangers of an un-checked arms race, is one that is important.Much has been made of the technical &quot;goofs&quot; in the film, and yes there are some, Boom-mikes can aparrently be seen periodically, Costner's accent may be too forced and distracting for some and  the directorial strategy of mixing B&amp;W, color, archive, and dramatic footage lacks some of the oomph of Oliver Stone's work in a similar vein, even if the script refrains from much of his excess.  However, the fact remains that the film does more right than wrong.  Screenwriter Self makes this material into a tight script that takes its primary dialogues from the real transcripts, and never really looses its focus.  The performances and direction mostly give the material the the severity and weight it needs and Director Donaldson makes the majority of the points he tries to fairly cleanly.The Bonuses on this disc make it shine however, there is a wealth of material on the characters and events which populate the story and while not encyclopedic the infinifilm features do a solid job of providing a basic introduction to the events and players.  This material is no substitute for actually reading about the events, but its neither designed to be a course on the subject nor can it be expected to be so.Technically the Disc is quite nice, the interface is only slightly complex, but new line has provided robust help options, and the film itself is crisp and clean.  The audio is rarely &quot;reference&quot; level but that is entirely appropiate in keeping with the tone of the film and the nature of the proceedings: Keep in mind this is not a combat film, the war opn screen here is of nerves and wills, flashy acoustics would only distract.Politics is dry stuff and even if the film's flaws are unforgivable (Which I dont feel) the importance of politics and of inteligent inteligent leadership is stressed here in ways not often seen on film.  For that alone the film has a significant space in my collection.",4,Worth watching,1004832000,"11 4, 2001",2001,3265,"['Attempting', 'capture', 'history', 'silver', 'screen', 'always', 'tricky', 'proposition', 'especially', 'when', 'have', 'figures', 'as', 'notable', 'Kennedy', 'Brothers', 'center', 'somehwhat', 'surprising', 'how', 'deeply', 'two', 'go', 'even', 'today', 'presense', 'alone', 'can', 'often', 'distract', 'proceedings', 'many', 'viewers', 'will', 'doubt', 'engage', 'quot', 'doing', 'quot', 'good', 'Kennedy', 'question.Such', 'issues', 'film', 'accused', 'being', 'too', 'slanted', 'historically', 'inaccurate', 'claim', 'have', 'merit', 'Costner', 'character', 'elevated', 'status', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'Vice-President', 'nowhere', 'be', 'seen', 'What', 'must', 'be', 'noted', 'film', 'defense', 'majority', 'dialogue', 'interactions', 'are', 'based', 'transcribed', 'directly', '100+', 'hours', 'recently', 'de-clasified', 'audio-recordings', 'made', 'proceedings', 'White', 'House', 'durring', 'events', 'portrayed', 'interviews', 'memoirs', 'key', 'players', 'very', 'least', 'film', 'tries', 'create', 'much', 'truth', 'can', 'using', 'actual', 'materials', 'where', 'can', 'Photographs', 'misele', 'sites', 'are', 'actual', 'photopgraphs', 'slightly', 'too', 'much', 'slant', 'name', 'drama', 'can', 'usually', 'be', 'forgiven', 'overall', 'goal', 'illustrate', 'dangers', 'un-checked', 'arms', 'race', 'one', 'important.Much', 'been', 'made', 'technical', 'quot', 'quot', 'film', 'yes', 'are', 'Boom-mikes', 'can', 'aparrently', 'be', 'seen', 'periodically', 'Costner', 'accent', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'forced', 'distracting', 'directorial', 'strategy', 'mixing', 'B', 'amp', 'W', 'color', 'archive', 'dramatic', 'footage', 'oomph', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'work', 'similar', 'vein', 'even', 'script', 'much', 'excess', 'However', 'fact', 'film', 'more', 'right', 'wrong', 'Screenwriter', 'Self', 'material', 'tight', 'script', 'primary', 'dialogues', 'real', 'transcripts', 'never', 'really', 'focus', 'performances', 'direction', 'mostly', 'give', 'material', 'severity', 'weight', 'Director', 'Donaldson', 'majority', 'points', 'fairly', 'cleanly.The', 'Bonuses', 'disc', 'make', 'shine', 'however', 'wealth', 'material', 'characters', 'events', 'populate', 'story', 'not', 'encyclopedic', 'infinifilm', 'features', 'do', 'solid', 'job', 'providing', 'basic', 'introduction', 'events', 'players', 'material', 'substitute', 'actually', 'reading', 'events', 'neither', 'designed', 'be', 'course', 'subject', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'be', 'so.Technically', 'Disc', 'quite', 'nice', 'interface', 'only', 'slightly', 'complex', 'new', 'line', 'provided', 'robust', 'help', 'options', 'film', 'crisp', 'clean', 'audio', 'rarely', 'quot', 'reference', 'quot', 'level', 'entirely', 'appropiate', 'keeping', 'tone', 'film', 'nature', 'proceedings', 'Keep', 'mind', 'not', 'combat', 'film', 'war', 'opn', 'screen', 'here', 'nerves', 'wills', 'flashy', 'acoustics', 'would', 'only', 'distract.Politics', 'dry', 'stuff', 'even', 'film', 'flaws', 'are', 'unforgivable', 'Which', 'dont', 'feel', 'importance', 'politics', 'inteligent', 'inteligent', 'leadership', 'stressed', 'here', 'ways', 'not', 'often', 'seen', 'film', 'film', 'significant', 'space', 'collection']",N/A

We were in the middle of a conflict war that could easily have escallated into global nuclear war!&quot;  I don't know if I blinked all the way through the movie.This movie is, without a doubt, the must-see, must-have video about the Cuban missle crisis.  &quot;Thirteen Days&quot; took me back to my early childhood in New Orleans, LA.  Though I do not remember the actual missle crisis myself, I do recall having missle drills in my elementary school during the mid-1960s, and I grew up amidst the attendant threat of nuclear war.&quot;Thirteen Days&quot; is 5-star drama, based on actual historical events about real people facing real situations.  And Kevin Costner and crew did an outstanding job portraying what was one of the defining moments in United States History.  It did an excellent job of showing many of the conflicting opinions and actions surrounding the crisis.  After the movie I thought to myself about how easy it would have been for JFK to act on the advice of his military advisors.  Thank goodness he did what he did.The movie uses a technique of shifting from color to B/W footage to underscore the timeframe and stark reality of situations being portrayed to great effect.This top-flight movie will be enjoyed by any viewer -- history buff or not.  I recommend this movie highly.  Viewers should be aware that the reason for the PG-13 rating is the presence of sporadic, stress-triggered foul language (though it is not as foul as is found in most R-movies).5-stars for the storyline, acting, and dramatic impact.

You will come away with a greater appreciation of having had a strong American adminstration in the White House willing to stand up to the military machine of the day.During an interview Fidel Castro had a few years ago, he said that had American forces landed on Cuban beaches, he would have retaliated with nuclear force.

582534,A1A87TUBBDPMF0,B00005J760,"Alex Diaz-Granados ""fardreaming writer""","[6, 8]","Roger Donaldson's Thirteen Days, overwhelmingly ignored by moviegoers three years ago, is perhaps Hollywood's first theatrical recreation of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.  It's a pity, too, because this film is a gripping recreation of our closest brush with global thermonuclear war.  With a mix of Tom Clancy-like attention to detail and the human drama of decent men and women on both the American and Soviet sides to avoid World War III, this movie clearly deserved more attention and acclaim than it received.Perhaps it was the lack of suspense - after all, we are here and the world did not end in 1962.  Perhaps it was the fact that moviegoers normally don't like true-life historical dramas.  Perhaps it  was the presence of oh-so-dour Kevin Costner in this picture.  (Poor Costner...once so promising and guaranteed box-office gold....once he earned those Oscars for Dances With Wolves he became so darned serious!  And boring!)  Perhaps it was apathy about yet another film with John F. Kennedy as a major character.  For whatever reason, Thirteen Days had one heck of a short run that could be measured in a span of days.As I said, pity.  The movie itself is extremely well made, with good pacing, able directing from Donaldson and fine acting from JAG's Steven Culp as Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, Bruce Greenwood as President Kennedy, and the still-dour Costner as Kenneth P. O'Donnell.  (Costner's faux Boston accent does tend to come and go, but accents have never been old Kevin's strong suit anyway.)  The special effects sequences are top rate, almost as good as any in a Star Wars film - but more down-to-Earth, as it were.  And for a movie that tackles such a heavy topic as the Cuban Missile Crisis, it never drags.The DVD from New Line Home Entertainment is one of those rare Infinifilm releases, with more extra features in its single disc than some double disc ""special edition"" DVDs.  Although it has no captions for the hearing impaired, it does have a Historical Information Track, which features information on the crisis.  The Historical Figures Commentary features archival audio of JFK, Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, Ken O'Donnell, Pierre Salinger, and Nikita Khruschev's son Sergei, and of course the director's behind-the-scenes commentary track.While I do not recommend this to casual movie watchers, Thirteen Days is still a good movie for history buffs and young people who did not live through the darkest days of the Cold War.",4,The Crisis That Shook the World Makes For a Fine Film,1057622400,"07 8, 2003",2003,2483,"['Roger', 'Donaldson', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'overwhelmingly', 'ignored', 'moviegoers', 'three', 'years', 'ago', 'perhaps', 'Hollywood', 'first', 'theatrical', 'recreation', '1962', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'pity', 'too', 'film', 'gripping', 'recreation', 'closest', 'brush', 'global', 'thermonuclear', 'war', 'mix', 'Tom', 'Clancy-like', 'attention', 'detail', 'human', 'drama', 'decent', 'men', 'women', 'American', 'Soviet', 'sides', 'avoid', 'World', 'War', 'III', 'movie', 'clearly', 'deserved', 'more', 'attention', 'acclaim', 'was', 'lack', 'suspense', 'are', 'here', 'world', 'did', 'not', 'end', '1962', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'fact', 'moviegoers', 'normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'true-life', 'historical', 'dramas', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'presence', 'oh-so-dour', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'picture', 'Poor', 'Costner', 'once', 'promising', 'guaranteed', 'box-office', 'gold', '.once', 'earned', 'Oscars', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'became', 'so', 'darned', 'serious', 'boring', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'apathy', 'yet', 'film', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'major', 'character', 'reason', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'had', 'one', 'heck', 'short', 'run', 'could', 'be', 'measured', 'span', 'days.As', 'said', 'pity', 'movie', 'extremely', 'well', 'made', 'good', 'pacing', 'able', 'directing', 'Donaldson', 'fine', 'acting', 'JAG', 'Steven', 'Culp', 'Attorney', 'General', 'Robert', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'President', 'Kennedy', 'still-dour', 'Costner', 'Kenneth', 'P.', ""O'Donnell"", 'Costner', 'faux', 'Boston', 'accent', 'tend', 'come', 'go', 'accents', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'old', 'Kevin', 'strong', 'suit', 'anyway', 'special', 'effects', 'sequences', 'are', 'top', 'rate', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'Star', 'Wars', 'film', 'more', 'down-to-Earth', 'were', 'movie', 'heavy', 'topic', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'never', 'drags.The', 'DVD', 'New', 'Line', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'one', 'rare', 'Infinifilm', 'releases', 'more', 'extra', 'features', 'single', 'disc', 'double', 'disc', 'special', 'edition', 'DVDs', 'captions', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'have', 'Historical', 'Information', 'Track', 'information', 'crisis', 'Historical', 'Figures', 'Commentary', 'features', 'archival', 'audio', 'JFK', 'Secretary', 'Defense', 'Robert', 'S.', 'McNamara', 'Ken', ""O'Donnell"", 'Pierre', 'Salinger', 'Nikita', 'Khruschev', 'son', 'Sergei', 'course', 'director', 'behind-the-scenes', 'commentary', 'track.While', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'casual', 'movie', 'watchers', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'still', 'good', 'movie', 'history', 'buffs', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'darkest', 'days', 'Cold', 'War']",N/A
582535,A1AHFIGBYPZTXC,B00005J760,Amazon Customer,"[1, 2]","Until today, the video diehards will be able to say they can do anything on VHS that you can do on DVD and, for most people, they'd be right. Nowadays, when you pop in your favorite DVD, you need to go searching through menus to find what you're really looking for. With the increasing amount of content packed on each disk, it can be a little bewildering even for a pro like myself (try finding the character animation studies on the Nightmare Before Christmas disc). It takes a dedicated geek to get the most out of every disc and most people won't even bother finding the deleted scenes, not to mention the 'Easter Eggs' that are now basically standard on every release. The other problem with this approach is that you see all of these little clips and notes out of context. These are the two prongs of the Infinifilm attack: exclusive features and ease of use.The new Infinifilm format (they could have chosen a better name) solves the first problem by providing relevant, contextual information right in the film itself. As you watch the Infinifilm version of the movie (and you can choose to watch the regular version as well) a transparent blue bar will pop up occasionally offering you one or two choices for extra features and the running time of each. It's so intuitive, it's scary.While previewing a copy of the upcoming 'Thirteen Days', this point was driven home when a menu popped up at the bottom of the screen offering me the chance to see how the White House exterior was created. After a very small clip that showed that the whole wing was really false, I was then put back in the film and saw the end product right on the screen!These menus offer a wealth of information in very small clips by accessing the documentaries on the disc and providing an immediate link to the relevant bits. It reminds me of the web links that come up in Frontline. This is exactly what computers were made for.The second difference on the Infinifilm discs that you will immediately notice are the question marks that seem to be placed on nearly every menu and selection. This is the new help system that New Line has come up with so that Aunt Irma doesn't have to miss 3/4 of the content. If she wants to know what Dolby Digital is, the question mark will tell her.Of course the old hands among us will mostly ignore those little offerings of assistance, but it's good to see that New Line has the customer squarely in mind here.The 'Thirteen Days' DVD is really the perfect initial offering, having so much source material to draw from. Not only will you see deleted scenes that show you how an entire subplot can be edited out, but you also get the special effects shots, cast and crew info and all the real historical information from the Cuban missile crisis.The included 48 minute documentary on the real event includes interviews from newsmakers and reporters, historical footage of the time and even many scenes talking with Nikita Khrushchev's son. You can watch it in pieces over the course of the film should you choose to access it all, or as a standalone feature.On initially hearing about Infinifilm, I thought it was just another marketing ploy that really wouldn't do anything new for me. After having seen it in action I can tell you that it will add a very real depth to the film that you just can't get by watching the content separately. That's the VHS way.

The cast is composed of a plethera of solid and veteran character actors that add only more credibility that unfortunately is constantly being tampered with by Costner's inexcusable, boarish and obtrusive Jihad of placing himself in the middle of critical history making moments. It's comforting that Kevin Costner was able to outsmart and counsel the Kennedy brothers and save us all from nuclear anhiliation. Give me a break. Costner once said &quot;I don't make movies for critics.&quot; That's a good thing, because the only criticism of this film is clearly Costner's performance and delusions of taking a JFK lacke (O'Donnell) and somehow twisting him into the savior of the free world and high-priest and comfortor to the fighter pilots who put their lives on the line during the Cuban missile crisis. Delete Costner from this film, and you have one of the greatest historical docudramas ever produced. The quality and mountain of special features on this DVD alone make this a quality purchase. Now if we can work out a delete mechanism on the DVD player to get Costner off the screen for the duration of this film, it would be much more enjoyable.

582540,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B00005J760,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[2, 3]","Given that vast numbers of books and films depict a 'high-stakes' scenario where the fate of the world (real or imagined) hangs in the balance, it is interesting that relatively little attention has been paid in recent years to the one time when the fate of our world really did hang in the balance. The Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 is the closest that the Cold War ever came to heating up (certainly the closest moment that was known about at the time; a Soviet computer malfunction in 1983 was extremely dangerous but not widely known until years later), when the United States and the Soviet Union stared one another down and the most careful diplomacy had to be used to defuse the crisis. The diplomatic resolution over the crisis was considerably complicated by the lack of any direct methods of communication between the White House and the Kremlin, with messages having to be sent by back channels and feelers extended through the media and the United Nations. In fact, the crisis resulted in the installation of the Washington-Moscow hotline to avoid such problems in the future.Roger Donaldson's film, released in late 2000, attempts to chronicle the crisis exclusively from the point-of-view of the United States government. There are no scenes set in Havana or Moscow, and the only scenes in Cuba are transition-based ones showing the progress of the missiles being set up and fuelled. This approach is highly effective, as it means the viewer is as blind to what is going on in the USSR and Cuba as the President and his advisors are, and this heightens dramatic moments near the end of the film where important decisions have to be made almost by guesswork: has Khrushchev been deposed in a military coup or not? Is a peace offer genuine or simply an attempt to stall for time? Just as the President and his inner circle had no way of knowing in 1962, so the viewer has no way of knowing in the film.The film makes the interesting choice to have the action seen from the perspective of Kennedy's appointments secretary (and effective chief of staff), Kenneth O'Donnell, who had no formal policy or advisory role but was a close and old friend of both JFK and his brother Robert. This is an interesting and wise choice, as many of the other characters involved in the crisis are politicians or generals of fairly grand stature themselves, such as General Le May, McNamara, Adlai Stevenson and so on, and using them as the main POV would make the film more about them than the crisis. The relatively unknown O'Donnell, played very well by the surprisingly good Kevin Costner (struggling manfully with a bad accent), carries less baggage and the film isn't so much about him (despite a few half-hearted family scenes) as about the Kennedy brothers and the crisis itself.Bruce Greenwood plays JFK and Steven Culp his brother Robert, and both are excellent, really inhabiting their characters. Greenwood in particular delivers real gravitas as the President, but also lets slip a few moments of annoyance and contempt for some of his advisors, reflecting some of the tensions that dogged the Kennedy presidency. The lack of faith that Kennedy can deal with the crisis is almost palpable among the senior military figures, and the stress this inflects on the President is well-depicted by Greenwood.The movie makes several interesting historical points. Whilst some elements, such as the worth of O'Donnell's counsel (Kennedy is seen consulting with O'Donnell and apparently heeding his advice more than the experts, which is questionable), are historically dubious, the idea that Kennedy considered the fates of Cuba and Berlin to be entwined and a US attack on Cuba would trigger a Soviet attack on Berlin is strongly pushed in the film. Kennedy's deep concern over Berlin, heightened by the recent construction of the Berlin Wall, would lead him to a historically famous visit to the city just a few months after the Cuban Missile Crisis.Less successful is its depiction of the military. The movie starts off by presenting a pretty credible case for military action. A swift and massive US aerial assault on Cuba is portrayed as not leading automatically to war (whilst an invasion would), but could destroy the USA's moral authority in a future conflict. Nevertheless, the strong advantages of the aerial assault are initially fairly presented. However, from then on the military option is consistently presented as the 'wrong' one and some of the senior admirals and generals, such as Le May, are presented almost as villains who even sidestep around Kennedy to try to trigger a conflict. This simplification of the military's actions during the crisis is the movie's key weak point and muddles the issues involved somewhat as well as coming across as a needless attempt to introduce more drama to the script.This weakness is a shame as the rest of the movie is very good. The dramatic tension of the military build-up and the politicians' mounting confusion during the fog of diplomacy as they attempt to second-guess the Soviet motives at the end of the film are handled superbly. The performances in the movie has pretty much first-rate across the board (Costner's accent issues aside), and the few special effects sequences showing spy planes overflying Cuba and so far are effective, if inexplicably expensive; the movie had a budget of $80 million, higher than Independence Day, and is totally bereft of comparable action or effects sequences.Thirteen Days (****) is a very solid film. It shows the stresses of government and effectively depicts a period in the history of the world that should never be forgotten. The film is available now on DVD (UK, USA).",5,A very strong movie,1263772800,"01 18, 2010",2010,5676,"['Given', 'vast', 'numbers', 'books', 'films', 'depict', ""'high-stakes"", 'scenario', 'where',

Etnyre ""roguemissive""","[10, 12]","A film that takes place during what has become known as ""the Cuban Missile Crisis"", an event which is not only a harrowing chapter for the United States, but potentially for human civilization as well.  This important historical period is a interesting and fascinating subject, centered around then-President John F. Kennedy's handling of the extremely tense situation whereby the Soviet Union was shipping and basing medium-range missiles capable of reaching the continental United States from the proxy regime of Cuba.Although this is excellent subject matter for a movie, unfortunately it is just a backdrop for the film THIRTEEN DAYS, which focuses on Kenny O'Connell (Kevin Costner), a friend and political advisor to JFK.  In spite of the gravity of the Crisis, the film spends too much time centered around someone not deserving of being the subject of the film.  O'Connell's character is not as interesting as the events unfolding around him, and not really compelling enough to warrant the attention, which would have been better spent on JFK and the confrontation and the Soviet perspective.  Further, Costner's attempt at a genuine Yankee (Massachusetts) accent is obvious and labored and ultimately unconvincing.  The whole thing comes off as a hint of a vanity project for Costner.Among the film's strengths includes Bruce Greenwood doing arguably the best portrayal of JFK to date depicted on film or TV.  The actor (Steven Culp) playing Bobby Kennedy was also a good pick and did a fine job in his limited role, and Dylan Baker gave an interesting performance as SecDef Robert McNamara.The best parts of the film were the two marvelous aerial scenes: the first featuring the 2-ship formation of RF-8 aircraft doing their high-speed, low-level recon of the Cuban missile sites; the second featuring the dramatization of Maj. Rudolph Anderson's fateful mission.  This was a compelling and tense sequence which completely draws the viewer in, even though the heartbreaking outcome was already known ahead of time.All in all, it was a decent film which could have been better if it concentrated on where the more compelling interest, characters, and actions were.",3,A decent film which could have been even better,1179878400,"05 23, 2007",2007,2174,"['film', 'place', 'what', 'become', 'known', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'event', 'not', 'only', 'harrowing', 'chapter', 'United', 'States', 'potentially', 'human', 'civilization', 'as', 'well', 'important', 'historical', 'period', 'interesting', 'fascinating', 'subject', 'centered', 'then-President', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'handling', 'extremely', 'tense', 'situation', 'whereby', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'was', 'shipping', 'basing', 'medium-range', 'missiles', 'capable', 'reaching', 'continental', 'United', 'States', 'proxy', 'regime', 'Cuba.Although', 'excellent', 'subject', 'matter', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'just', 'backdrop', 'film', 'THIRTEEN', 'DAYS', 'Kenny', ""O'Connell"", 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'friend', 'political', 'advisor', 'JFK', 'spite', 'gravity', 'Crisis', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'centered', 'someone', 'not', 'deserving', 'being', 'subject', 'film', ""O'Connell"", 'character', 'not', 'as', 'interesting', 'events', 'unfolding', 'not', 'really', 'compelling', 'enough', 'warrant', 'attention', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'spent', 'JFK', 'confrontation', 'Soviet', 'perspective', 'Further', 'Costner', 'attempt', 'genuine', 'Yankee', 'Massachusetts', 'accent', 'obvious', 'labored', 'ultimately', 'unconvincing', 'whole', 'thing', 'off', 'hint', 'vanity', 'project', 'Costner.Among', 'film', 'strengths', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'doing', 'arguably', 'best', 'portrayal', 'JFK', 'date', 'depicted', 'film', 'TV', 'actor', 'Steven', 'Culp', 'playing', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'pick', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'limited', 'role', 'Dylan', 'Baker', 'gave', 'interesting', 'performance', 'SecDef', 'Robert', 'McNamara.The', 'best', 'parts', 'film', 'were', 'two', 'marvelous', 'aerial', 'scenes', 'first', 'featuring', '2-ship', 'formation', 'RF-8', 'aircraft', 'doing', 'high-speed', 'low-level', 'recon', 'Cuban', 'missile', 'sites', 'second', 'featuring', 'dramatization', 'Maj.', 'Rudolph', 'Anderson', 'fateful', 'mission', 'was', 'compelling', 'tense', 'sequence', 'completely', 'viewer', 'even', 'heartbreaking', 'outcome', 'was', 'already', 'known', 'ahead', 'time.All', 'was', 'decent', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'concentrated', 'where', 'more', 'compelling', 'interest', 'characters', 'actions', 'were']",N/A

It is hard if not impossible to sift through what is almost endless material on an event like this and figure out what EXACTLY happened.But, in general terms, Thirteen Days is a great film. The movie does fantastically at dramatizing how dangerous the cold war was and how much one side mistrusted the other. If you grew up in the 1970s and 80s as I did, it is difficult to grasp how, in the 50s and 60s, atomic confrontation was a possibility you had to live with every day. I read once where John Kennedy asked someone if he built a fallout shelter or a swimming pool in his back yard. ""You made the wrong choice."" Kennedy said when he was told his friend built the pool.Thirteen Days brings this sense of danger to life. Costner is great, and Bruce Greenwood and Steven Culp play the Kennedy's well. They are not doing charactatures of the brothers, but are actors placing themselves in the situation, and giving convincing performances. You know that you are not looking at Jack and Bobby, but you are getting a great idea of how they, possibly, reacted.Two points stuck out, for me, watching Thirteen Days: At the start of the crisis, there seemed two options--War, or capitulation. It is amazing to watch how Kennedy and his inner-circle felt their way through, uncertainly, reactively, to find a third way.But what fancinated me more is how BAD communications were in 1962 and how this effected the Kennedys reactions and desicion making. Hours went by, waiting for telex messages to come through, waiting for phone calls, and trying to set up meetings through back channels. There was not even a hotline from Washington to Moscow yet.

Valuable for its historical accuracy alone, Thirteen Days chronicles the pivotal moments of the Cuban Missile crisis in October of 1962. Unlike countless films before it, Thirteen Days creates a true edge-of-your-seat atmosphere even through scenes with little or no physical action (i.e., common dialogue and men gathered around tables), and the film manages to maintain a certain level of suspense even though the audience knows the final outcome...Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner), Special Assistant to the President, is caught up in one of the greatest crises in human history when a conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union threatens to spark a nuclear war. When the CIA informs President John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) that the Soviet Union is secretly attempting to set up nuclear missile launch sites on the island of Cuba, the president must quickly determine which decisions will protect United States interests and avert an unprecedented nuclear war.Surrounded by top aides, President Kennedy must choose between a series of options that include sanctions, a naval blockade of Cuba, and an all-out invasion of the Caribbean island. Ultimately, Kennedy chooses a naval blockade. But Soviet vessels have already set sail for Cuba. Will they run the blockade? Will they turn back? In the end, the president must rely on a historic United Nations presentation by US Ambassador Adlai Stevenson (Michael Fairman), cool negotiations from his brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy (Steven Culp), and quite a bit of divine intervention to avoid what will be an inevitable civilization ending war in the absence of perfect decision-making...Although Kevin Costner fulfills his role well in Thirteen Days, I personally found it quite annoying listening to his hackneyed fake Bostonian accent. It's so out-of-the-ordinary (perhaps because audiences are already so familiar with Costner) that it detracts from one's ability to enjoy the film. This is truly sad, because Thirteen Days showcases extraordinary performances by Bruce Greenwood and Steven Culp in their portrayals of John and Robert Kennedy. Perhaps it's the magnitude of what's at stake in the storyline, but Greenwood and Culp are so convincing that the viewer almost begins to see them as the genuine articles.Given the subject matter, Thirteen Days is one of those rare films that can ratchet up the tension even in its down scenes. Perhaps for psychological reasons, audiences tend to become more involved in books and films which tackle actual true-to-life events. Thirteen Days deals with a short period when the world came within a hair's width of nuclear annihilation and that makes for a movie wrought with far more tension that your typical drama. You won't want to miss this film. Because of its outstanding ability to capture onscreen one of the pivotal turning points of human history, Thirteen Days is a definite must-see movie...The DVD Report",4,"A fascinating, historical film...",1114041600,"04 21, 2005",2005,3021,"['Snubbed', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2000', 'Valuable', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'alone', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'pivotal', 'moments', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'crisis', 'October', '1962', 'countless', 'films', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'true', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'atmosphere', 'even', 'scenes', 'little', 'physical', 'action', 'i.e.', 'common', 'dialogue', 'men', 'gathered', 'tables', 'film', 'maintain', 'certain', 'level', 'suspense', 'even', 'audience', 'final', 'outcome', 'Kenny', ""O'Donnell"", 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Special', 'Assistant', 'President', 'caught', 'up', 'one', 'greatest', 'crises', 'human', 'history', 'when', 'conflict', 'United', 'States', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'spark', 'nuclear', 'war', 'When', 'CIA', 'informs', 'President', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'secretly', 'attempting', 'set', 'up', 'nuclear', 'missile', 'launch', 'island', 'Cuba', 'president', 'must', 'quickly', 'determine', 'decisions', 'will', 'protect', 'United', 'States', 'interests', 'avert', 'unprecedented', 'nuclear', 'war.Surrounded', 'top', 'aides', 'President', 'Kennedy', 'must', 'choose', 'series', 'options', 'include', 'sanctions', 'naval', 'blockade', 'Cuba', 'all-out', 'invasion', 'Caribbean', 'island', 'Ultimately', 'Kennedy', 'naval', 'blockade', 'Soviet', 'vessels', 'have', 'already', 'set', 'sail', 'Cuba', 'Will', 'run', 'blockade', 'turn', 'back', 'end', 'president', 'must', 'rely', 'historic', 'United', 'Nations', 'presentation', 'US', 'Ambassador', 'Adlai', 'Stevenson', 'Michael', 'Fairman', 'cool', 'negotiations', 'brother', 'Attorney', 'General', 'Robert', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'Steven', 'Culp', 'quite', 'bit', 'divine', 'intervention', 'avoid', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'inevitable', 'civilization', 'ending', 'war', 'absence', 'perfect', 'decision-making', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'role', 'well', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'personally', 'found', 'quite', 'annoying', 'listening', 'hackneyed', 'fake', 'Bostonian', 'accent', 'so', 'out-of-the-ordinary', 'perhaps', 'audiences', 'are', 'already', 'so', 'familiar', 'Costner', 'one', 'ability', 'enjoy', 'film', 'truly', 'sad', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'extraordinary', 'performances', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'Steven', 'Culp', 'portrayals', 'John', 'Robert', 'Kennedy', 'Perhaps', 'magnitude', 'what', 'stake', 'storyline', 'Greenwood', 'Culp', 'are', 'so', 'convincing', 'viewer', 'almost', 'see', 'genuine', 'subject', 'matter', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'can', 'ratchet', 'up', 'tension', 'even', 'down', 'scenes', 'Perhaps', 'psychological', 'reasons', 'audiences', 'tend', 'become', 'more', 'involved', 'books', 'films', 'tackle', 'actual', 'true-to-life', 'events', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'deals', 'short', 'period', 'when', 'world', 'came', 'hair', 'width', 'nuclear', 'annihilation', 'movie', 'wrought', 'far', 'more', 'tension', 'typical', 'drama', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'film', 'outstanding', 'ability', 'capture', 'onscreen', 'one', 'pivotal', 'turning', 'points', 'human', 'history', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'definite', 'must-see', 'movie', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

Costner and Culp are also good, but the story puts Greenwood in the spotlight.I'm not sure why, but I read a lot of criticism of Costner wherever he is involved. His mistakes are apparently unforgivable and live forever in the minds of his critics. In this movie, the accent is overblown, but good grief get over it and enjoy this excellent movie. Some of his home & family scenes were a little out of place, but this was a writing problem, not an acting problem. Regardless, Costner is the big name in this movie, but he is not the star. Greenwood is the star of the movie due to the fact he plays JFK, period. It couldn't have been any other way to fulfill the design of this movie. That is not a criticism, its just what the movie required.Back on point, the movie provides an interesting and dramatic insight into the internal debate and conflict during the crisis. The back-and-forth of ideas on how the US should respond was quite interesting and showed the enormous pressure the President and all the players were under during the crisis. One wrong move could have literally killed millions. It's incomprehensible.My main gripe was the negative portrayal of the military. After all, even if they did push for military action, they were also under tremendous pressure, and were watching  their tactical advantage dwindle on a daily basis. If I may make the understatement of the week, the nuclear bombs of a hostile and aggressive 1962 Russia just a few miles off the coast was cause for concern. You would expect the military to take any step that would increase the chances of a successful military operation if diplomacy failed to resolve the conflict, which it nearly did. Don't view or evaluate the political situation by today's standards, or be nave about the need for military action based on today's situation. If the Russian ships had not stopped and turned back at the blockade, and the US was forced to fire on them, the military's recommendation, while we still had the element of surprise with us, may have proven to have been the better option, as the element of surprise would now have been gone. I digress.Although there are around 250 reviews on Amazon, I believe this is still a relatively unknown movie as I discovered the few times I lent my copy to friends and family.

It was more thrilling when I was kid and actually lived through it.  Even worse, it is told from the perspective of Kenny O'Donnell (Costner), aide to JFK during the crisis, with a Boston accent the likes of which I've never heard before (my father's family all being from New England). This is also one of those glowing, idealized versions of the Kennedys which doesn't even hint of some of the real problems of that presidency.  For one, it has been well reported that Bobby Kennedy had to comb the hotels of DC looking for JFK, who was with yet another woman, to tell him about the crisis and get him back to the White House to deal with it. One would never guess that the JFK in this film ever strayed from lofty Olympian heights of statemanship to such pedestrian level living.  There was a tv mini series some years ago which covered all of this same ground quite well about the Cuban missle crisis and I don't see where this film, as a major theatrical release, covered any new ground.

Therefore, while there are some liberties taken with the truth to emphasize the dramatic effect in this movie, I was impressed with the attention to historical accuracy. Since their deaths, a great deal of sludge has been published about President John and Attorney General Robert Kennedy. Most of this is true, which tarnishes their place in history. However, when this country desperately needed the leadership to step up and resolve the most dangerous nuclear crisis ever encountered, they proved worthy of their positions. Their resolve, self-doubt and effective decision making are captured in this movie.To this day, few people realize that during the missile crisis the United States and the Soviet Union were within minutes, if not seconds, of engaging in a shooting war. Isolated shots were fired, but nothing where both sides were firing at each other. The producers also capture the fundamental hostility that existed between the political and military leadership. All of the upper level military leaders were extremely hawkish, and were eager to risk a nuclear war. President Kennedy issued orders to the military leaders and somehow they would occasionally ""forget"" to completely comply. This was especially true of Air Force General Curtis LeMay, who openly snickers when President Kennedy complains about an inappropriate encroachment into Soviet airspace. Fortunately for the world, the political leaders overruled the military and made decisions that avoided what would have been the deadliest war ever fought.If you like historical drama, then this is a movie you must see.",4,Some poetic license but still historically accurate,1135814400,"12 29, 2005",2005,1688,"['have', 'read', 'several', 'accounts', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'crisis', 'watched', 'least', 'two', 'documentaries', 'Therefore', 'are', 'liberties', 'taken', 'truth', 'emphasize', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'movie', 'was', 'impressed', 'attention', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'deaths', 'great', 'deal', 'sludge', 'been', 'published', 'President', 'John', 'Attorney', 'General', 'Robert', 'Kennedy', 'Most', 'true', 'place', 'history', 'However', 'when', 'country', 'desperately', 'needed', 'leadership', 'step', 'up', 'resolve', 'most', 'dangerous', 'nuclear', 'crisis', 'ever', 'encountered', 'proved', 'worthy', 'positions', 'resolve', 'self-doubt', 'effective', 'decision', 'making', 'are', 'captured', 'movie.To', 'day', 'few', 'people', 'realize', 'missile', 'crisis', 'United', 'States', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'were', 'minutes', 'not', 'engaging', 'shooting', 'war', 'Isolated', 'shots', 'were', 'fired', 'nothing', 'where', 'sides', 'were', 'firing', 'other', 'producers', 'also', 'capture', 'fundamental', 'hostility', 'existed', 'political', 'military', 'leadership', 'upper', 'level', 'military', 'leaders', 'were', 'extremely', 'hawkish', 'were', 'eager', 'risk', 'nuclear', 'war', 'President', 'Kennedy', 'issued', 'orders', 'military', 'leaders', 'somehow', 'would', 'occasionally', 'forget', 'completely', 'comply', 'was', 'especially', 'true', 'Air', 'Force', 'General', 'Curtis', 'LeMay', 'who', 'openly', 'snickers', 'when', 'President', 'Kennedy', 'inappropriate', 'encroachment', 'Soviet', 'airspace', 'Fortunately', 'world', 'political', 'leaders', 'overruled', 'military', 'made', 'decisions', 'avoided', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'deadliest', 'war', 'ever', 'fought.If', 'like', 'historical', 'drama', 'then', 'movie', 'must', 'see']",N/A

Kennedy looms large during this time and has become a martyr because of his tragic death in Dallas. The cornucopia of written, audio and visual material on this time in American history is staggering. There are so many great books on this time in our history. The amount of books on Kennedy is astounding. I definitely would recommend Robert Reaves' 'President Kennedy-Profile in Power' and Michael Beschloss' 'The Crisis Years' to put this film in historical perspective. I really think they will add even more to a person's enjoyment of 'Thirteen Days'.'Thirteen Days' is just a really good depiction of this critical time in American history. I always enjoy watching it even though we know how it will end. Bruce Greenwood is really great as JFK. He really captures the man pretty well and is not just a talking wax figure of a historical person. He really makes him come alive. Steven Culp is also excellent as RFK and he captures quite well the mannerisms and voice of the other Kennedy martyr. He also imbues his character with life. Kevin Costner is good as Kenny O'Donnell but you really want to see more of Greenwood and Culp. Costner is pretty much the audiences 'in' to the picture and is quite good in the role he is given. Kenny O' Donnell really was a close friend of JFK and I recommend his memoir 'Johnny, we hardly knew ye' for further insight.In other important roles: Dylan Baker makes a convincing Robert McNamara, Michael Fairman IS Adlai Stevenson, Kevin Conway really brings the arrogance of Curtis Lemay to life, and in a small but important role Len Cariou impresses as the legendary Dean Acheson.The DVD is really a must have because it contains so much good material on the making of the movie and the history that inspired it. The picture and audio are both well done also. Really after watching the DVD I felt as if I had been there in October 1962. Really a top notch historical thriller.

Skipping backand forth is just a frustration to watch.There really is a plot to Thirteen Days and its too bad that it gets buried under distractions, because the storyline of the movie is presented really well.

The story is gripping and held my intrest throughout the whole film; the acting was also great, not just from Costner but from all the supporting actors, also. This movie is intelligent, engrossing, and boasts great talent- I think it's hugely underrated, probably because most people just want action and special effects (WHAT? Where's all the nuclear explosions?! That was a waste of time!). I couldn't believe it that Thirteen Days was completely snubbed at the Oscars, considering it's quality. Oh, well- no movie can have everything, I guess, including an Oscar.SPECIAL FEATURES: Thirteen Days is the first in the Infinifilm series from New Line Cinema, and man, is it great.

Therefore, I cannot comment on the historical validity of this film.  However, as a political thriller, the film is very, very good.  It follows the events in the White House in the 13 Days of the Crisis, focussing on the Joint Chiefs, the various presidential Secretaries, and President JFK and his brother Bobby (then Attorney General).  We only see their Soviet nemeses through the words of a teletype and a few ambassadors.If this is not the way the Crisis played out, it COULD be, so if the facts are not quite accurate, the spirit is authentic.  We are drawn in and identify with the characters, and feel the tension.  Again, someone who actually lived through the Crisis is likely to feel the tension more acutely than I; that I felt tense watching the film is a testament to the skill of the filmakers and actors.Greenwood and Culp, as the two Kennedies, are not exact lookalikes, but you immediately accept them in the parts due to their performances.  Likewise the less-seen players, especially Fairman as Adlai Stephenson.  Costner puts in a good performance as our guide and observer to the events, as special assistant Kenny O'Donnell (a real person, but many have questioned the importance his character seems to have).  Unfortunately, I have to question the dialect coach - Costner, especially, has some kind of accent, but it doesn't sound like any Boston accent I've ever heard!  Likewise, the military brass in the persons of the Joint Chiefs are almost carricatures of well-known war Hawks such as Patton and MacArthur.  &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;'s Gen. Jack D. Ripper was no more Hawkish than these men!  However, someone has to be the &quot;bad guys&quot; and they are convenient targets (it is well documented that many of the top military brass wanted to strike first).This brings us to my main criticism of the film.  Throughout the commentary and extras, much is made of the fact that JFK was constantly trying to figure out why the Soviets were putting in the missiles.  We never see this in the film.  (In hindsight, it's obvious that they feared the U.S. would strike first.  Remember that the U.S. sent troops to fight the Reds during the Russian Civil War, which many Soviets considered an &quot;attack&quot; by the U.S. on the Soviet Union.  Simplistically speaking, they put in the missiles to even out the balance of power.)This DVD edition is interesting in that there is an option where little menus pop up with additional facts and vignettes about the actual Cuban Missile Crisis.  For my money, I found the frequency and short length of these mini-documentaries to be distracting - I found I would prefer these types of extras to be a regular, stand-alone documentary.  There is an audio commentary by several of the filmakers that is quite interesting (including the Australian director's take on the Crisis from half a world away).  All in all, a good film and a good DVD.",4,"A first rate thriller, even if loose with the facts",1043971200,"01 31, 2003",2003,3015,"['know', 'very', 'little', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'other', 'what', 'written', 'general', 'history', 'texts', 'Therefore', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'historical', 'validity', 'film', 'However', 'political', 'thriller', 'film', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'events', 'White', 'House', '13', 'Days', 'Crisis', 'focussing', 'Joint', 'Chiefs', 'various', 'presidential', 'Secretaries', 'President', 'JFK', 'brother', 'Bobby', 'then', 'Attorney', 'General', 'only', 'see', 'Soviet', 'nemeses', 'words', 'teletype', 'few', 'ambassadors.If', 'not', 'way', 'Crisis', 'played', 'out', 'COULD', 'be', 'facts', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'accurate', 'spirit', 'authentic', 'are', 'drawn', 'identify', 'characters', 'feel', 'tension', 'Again', 'someone', 'who', 'actually', 'lived', 'Crisis', 'likely', 'feel', 'tension', 'more', 'acutely', 'felt', 'tense', 'watching', 'film', 'testament', 'skill', 'filmakers', 'actors.Greenwood', 'Culp', 'two', 'Kennedies', 'are', 'not', 'exact', 'lookalikes', 'immediately', 'accept', 'parts', 'due', 'performances', 'Likewise', 'less-seen', 'players', 'especially', 'Fairman', 'Adlai', 'Stephenson', 'Costner', 'good', 'performance', 'guide', 'observer', 'events', 'special', 'assistant', 'Kenny', ""O'Donnell"", 'real', 'person', 'many', 'have', 'questioned', 'importance', 'character', 'have', 'Unfortunately', 'have', 'question', 'dialect', 'coach', 'Costner', 'especially', 'kind', 'accent', ""n't"", 'sound', 'Boston', 'accent', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'Likewise', 'military', 'brass', 'persons', 'Joint', 'Chiefs', 'are', 'almost', 'carricatures', 'well-known', 'war', 'Hawks', 'such', 'Patton', 'MacArthur', 'quot', 'Dr.', 'Strangelove', 'quot', 'Gen.', 'Jack', 'D.', 'Ripper', 'was', 'more', 'Hawkish', 'men', 'However', 'someone', 'be', 'quot', 'bad', 'guys', 'quot', 'are', 'convenient', 'targets', 'well', 'documented', 'many', 'top', 'military', 'brass', 'wanted', 'strike', 'first', '.This', 'main', 'criticism', 'film', 'commentary', 'extras', 'much', 'made', 'fact', 'JFK', 'was', 'constantly', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'Soviets', 'were', 'putting', 'missiles', 'never', 'see', 'film', 'hindsight', 'obvious', 'feared', 'U.S.', 'would', 'strike', 'first', 'Remember', 'U.S.', 'sent', 'troops', 'fight', 'Reds', 'Russian', 'Civil', 'War', 'many', 'Soviets', 'considered', 'quot', 'attack', 'quot', 'U.S.', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'Simplistically', 'speaking', 'put', 'missiles', 'even', 'out', 'balance', 'power', 'DVD', 'edition', 'interesting', 'option', 'where', 'little', 'menus', 'pop', 'up', 'additional', 'facts', 'vignettes', 'actual', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'money', 'found', 'frequency', 'short', 'length', 'mini-documentaries', 'be', 'distracting', 'found', 'would', 'prefer', 'types', 'extras', 'be', 'regular', 'stand-alone', 'documentary', 'audio', 'commentary', 'several', 'filmakers', 'quite', 'interesting', 'including', 'Australian', 'director', 'take', 'Crisis', 'world', 'away', 'good', 'film', 'good', 'DVD']",N/A

I remember watching news shows that showed maps and the blast range if an atomic warhead went off in a given city.  My friends and I talked about what a mushroom cloud might look like.  This movie is a dramatization of what went on in the Kennedy Whitehouse during those thirteen days of the crisis in October 1962 and how close we really came to the Cold War turning hot with awful consequences.It does portray the Kennedys as the heroes and the generals and the intelligence community as the villains who were trying to provoke a confrontation with the soviets.  That is a bit simplistic and provided for clear dramatic narrative, but it does provide insight into how difficult it is for any President to control the Washington bureaucracy.  (Can you imagine how much harder it is today given its growth since 1962?!?!?)The way the movie portrays the way Kennedy and Khrushchev were trying to signal each other and all the unknowns that both sides faced is also well done.  Since this is the crisis from the perspective of the Whitehouse, there is nothing from the Soviet side except as their emissaries interacted with those in the administration.  We struggle with the Kennedys and their advisors to figure out what is going on.As an aside, the book ""One Hell of a Gamble"" does a fabulous job in telling the story of the crisis in a much better context than this movie does.  It includes the way Castro made things more difficult.  It also shows Khrushchev struggling with his constituencies just as JFK and Bobby were.  You can see my review of that book on Amazon.com as well.Kevin Costner plays an adviser to the Kennedys and does a good job as the vehicle for carrying the drama.  The choices for JFK and Bobby are also good.  This is a movie I think every American should see and think through what nearly happened and why.  I also recommend reading the book I mention above.  The movie flips into Black & White sequences and I am never sure exactly why it does.  To give it a period feel because we watched television in B&W; in those days?  A documentary feel?

This helps us to see things from an ""outsider"" point of view; that is, we see things inside, but we are not thinking at the level of the President, for instance. It is meant to help us have empathy towards the situation. The storytelling, however, works. You end up getting a sense of urgency and of how important and quickly action and decisions need to be taken.The pace is pretty fast and the lines are pretty good - and even educational. If you do not know that Defcon 5 means peace time and that Defcon 2 or Defcon 1 is mobilize for war, this movie explains that.It is also surprisingly not political - or plain wrong and outrageous like Oliver Stone's JFK (also with Kevin Costner). The film tries to paint the historical perspective - which is that at the time, there were many in the US that did NOT like JFK (which most people forget in historical hindsight). The film tries to show the hawkish and antagonistic people vs. JFK and his administration. Yet the film defends those people's point of views as well and at times, shows the sneakiness of JFK and RFK in their own political gaming (intrigue) to keep it balanced and apolitical.The key takeaway from the entire movie is JFK's desire to avoid a war - which, ultimately, I wish both President and Congress thought that way towards Iraq back in 2003.There were some ""cheesy"" cinematic tricks used to try and tell the story - like switching to black and white before returning to color at certain points of the movie - to try and bring the viewer into the sense that this was a historical film. While it didn't take away from the film, I personally thought it wasn't wholly necessary.But, if you like political history, if you like period films, and if you just like a good film with excellent pacing, this is a great film that can truly be enjoyed again and again.",5,Wish President & Congress All Saw This in 2003 Before Iraq II,1221004800,"09 10, 2008",2008,2042,"['saw', 'film', 'years', 'ago', 'Iraq', 'War', 'II', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'well', 'story', 'was', 'told.The', 'story', 'crisis', 'perspective', 'generally', 'special', 'assistant', 'president', 'Kenneth', ""O'Donnell"", 'see', 'things', 'outsider', 'point', 'view', 'see', 'things', 'inside', 'are', 'not', 'thinking', 'level', 'President', 'instance', 'meant', 'help', 'have', 'empathy', 'towards', 'situation', 'storytelling', 'however', 'works', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'sense', 'urgency', 'how', 'important', 'quickly', 'action', 'decisions', 'need', 'be', 'taken.The', 'pace', 'pretty', 'fast', 'lines', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'even', 'educational', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'Defcon', '5', 'means', 'peace', 'time', 'Defcon', '2', 'Defcon', '1', 'mobilize', 'war', 'movie', 'that.It', 'also', 'surprisingly', 'not', 'political', 'plain', 'wrong', 'outrageous', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'JFK', 'also', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'film', 'tries', 'paint', 'historical', 'perspective', 'time', 'were', 'many', 'US', 'did', 'NOT', 'JFK', 'most', 'people', 'forget', 'historical', 'hindsight', 'film', 'tries', 'show', 'hawkish', 'antagonistic', 'people', 'vs.', 'JFK', 'administration', 'film', 'people', 'point', 'views', 'well', 'times', 'sneakiness', 'JFK', 'RFK', 'own', 'political', 'gaming', 'intrigue', 'keep', 'balanced', 'apolitical.The', 'key', 'takeaway', 'entire', 'movie', 'JFK', 'desire', 'avoid', 'war', 'ultimately', 'wish', 'President', 'Congress', 'thought', 'way', 'Iraq', 'back', '2003.There', 'were', 'cheesy', 'cinematic', 'tricks', 'used', 'try', 'tell', 'story', 'switching', 'black', 'white', 'before', 'returning', 'color', 'certain', 'points', 'movie', 'try', 'bring', 'viewer', 'sense', 'was', 'historical', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'film', 'personally', 'thought', 'was', ""n't"", 'wholly', 'necessary.But', 'like', 'political', 'history', 'like', 'period', 'films', 'just', 'good', 'film', 'excellent', 'pacing', 'great', 'film', 'can', 'truly', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'again', 'again']",N/A

It is even more &quot;History&quot; then &quot;Hollywood&quot;.I think the Cuban Missile Crisis is one of the most important events in American History.  However, many younger Americans know so very little about the very important events depicted in this carefully planned and conscientiously researched film.Steven Culp's portrayal of Robert F. Kennedy was simply uncanny.  It has got to be difficult to act as a person so many people know so well.  I thought his performance was fabulous.  Kevin Costner played the role of presidential aide Kenneth O'Donnell.  His performance was very good however; his Boston accent was terrible and really does get on your nerves, especially in the beginning of the film.  Bruce Greenwood plays John F. Kennedy and does this great president justice.I highly recommend the infini film DVD version of this movie.  The Beyond the Movie features are wonderful.  The Historical Figures Commentary features archival audio of John F. Kennedy, Robery McNamara, P. O'Donnell, Pierre Salinger, Sergie Khrushchev, and many others.

What this film does is to deliver a powerful dramatization of those events. Robert Greenwood is completely believable as Kennedy, and Steven Culp as RFK is positively spooky the way he nails that role.The movie is incredible in its portrayal of how Kennedy was only barely able to keep matters from spinning out of control. Between his ultra right-wing generals spoiling for a war with the Soviets and a Kremlin in total chaos, it's astonishing we're all still here. This was one time in history when the will of good men prevailed.It's interesting to view this movie in light of previously classified information about the Cuban Missile Crisis that has been disclosed recently by the Russians. The situation was far more dangerous than Kennedy realized. What we didn't know at the time was that the Soviets had stationed a wolf pack of submarines lying in wait inside the quarantine zone, each armed with a nuclear warhead torpedo, and with orders to use them against American naval vessels if attacked. One was. Yet the Soviet captain decided, miraculously, even as we were depth charging his sub, not to start a nuclear war.This is a timely film, and one that should be required viewing for all Americans.",5,A Gripping Film and A Valuable History Lesson,1036972800,"11 11, 2002",2002,1323,"['Most', 'Americans', '50', 'will', 'never', 'forget', '13', 'days', 'when', 'world', 'teetered', 'brink', 'nuclear', 'holocaust', 'What', 'film', 'deliver', 'powerful', 'dramatization', 'events', 'Robert', 'Greenwood', 'completely', 'believable', 'Kennedy', 'Steven', 'Culp', 'RFK', 'positively', 'spooky', 'way', 'role.The', 'movie', 'incredible', 'portrayal', 'how', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'only', 'barely', 'able', 'keep', 'matters', 'spinning', 'control', 'Between', 'ultra', 'right-wing', 'generals', 'spoiling', 'war', 'Soviets', 'Kremlin', 'total', 'chaos', 'astonishing', ""'re"", 'still', 'here', 'was', 'one', 'time', 'history', 'when', 'will', 'good', 'men', 'prevailed.It', 'interesting', 'view', 'movie', 'light', 'previously', 'classified', 'information', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'been', 'disclosed', 'recently', 'Russians', 'situation', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'dangerous', 'Kennedy', 'realized', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'time', 'was', 'Soviets', 'had', 'stationed', 'wolf', 'pack', 'submarines', 'lying', 'wait', 'quarantine', 'zone', 'armed', 'nuclear', 'warhead', 'torpedo', 'orders', 'use', 'American', 'naval', 'vessels', 'attacked', 'One', 'was', 'Soviet', 'captain', 'decided', 'miraculously', 'even', 'were', 'depth', 'charging', 'sub', 'not', 'start', 'nuclear', 'war.This', 'timely', 'film', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'Americans']",N/A

Johnson,"[0, 0]","On October 14, 1962 a United States spy plane flying high over the island nation of Cuba took a photograph of a chilling sight: a military encampment being run by a group of Soviet army personnel. The Russkies were busily installing medium range ballistic missiles that would put the eastern half of the United States within range of a nuclear attack. For some reason that remains hidden to history, then Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev didn't think this little project would raise any hackles in Washington.Khrushchev was wrong. From the time that President John Kennedy learned of the threat until the time the Soviets backed down and began to remove the missiles, a little less than two weeks later, was one of the most tense, and possibly least understood, periods in United States history.I lived through the Cuban Missile Crisis as a child, lived through the daily ""duck and cover"" exercises at school, as if covering your head with your hands could help you survive a nuclear blast. I lived through my father's regrets over moving his family from the relative safety of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, to the prime target that was New Orleans, Louisiana, a target that sat so far below sea level that the construction of bomb shelters was not possible. I breathed in my parents' fear and uncertainty, saw the dread written on the faces of my teachers, and tried to decipher as many snippets of worried adult conversation as I could pick up. But until I saw Kevin Costner's new movie, Thirteen Days, I had no idea that we, as a nation, literally came within hours of nuclear Armageddon.In this tightly scripted outing by David Self, (based upon the book, The Kennedy Tapes - Inside the White House During the Cuban Missile Crisis, by Philip D. Zelikow and Ernest R. May) the true terror of those days comes alive. Costner plays Kenny O'Donnell, a college friend JFK has appointed as his special advisor. Through his eyes, we watch Kennedy and his brother, Robert, play a heart-stopping game of diplomatic and military brinkmanship, fighting not only the Soviets, but also their own military commanders, who, despite Kennedy's record as a war hero, never trusted their commander in chief.Thirteen Days features a number of strong performances, including Dylan Baker as Robert McNamara and Bruce Greenwood as President Kennedy. Kostner is competent, but his Boston accent is uneven, and that was a bit of a distraction. When is Costner going to learn that accents are not his strong point? One would have thought after the embarrassment of Robin Hood, the man would have never attempted another accent again as long as he lived.Roger Donaldson shows a sure hand as the director, giving just enough information to keep the audience informed without overwhelming them.

Levine,"[14, 16]","Recently my teenage son asked me if the horror of the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks was the most significant event of my lifetime. Of course, the answer is &quot;yes,&quot; overshadowing such monumental events as JFK's assasination, the space shuttle explosion, Armstrong setting foot on the moon and the crisis depicted in this movie ... the Cuban Missile Crisis. Nontheless, the Missile crisis was a monumentally significant event and this movie captures the tension that I remember so well.Some reviewers have critcized Kevin Costner's characterization of Kenny O'Donnell, noting that the movie assigns him a greater role than O'Donnell actually played and also noting that Costner's &quot;Havad&quot; accent was overplayed. This is a minor concern, however, since docudramas often need a protagonist from whose eyes we view unfolding drama. Costner helps provide those eyes, for us, the viewers.What is striking about this film is that it captures the tension felt in October 1962. I remember that there was indeed a concern that we might go to war; that the unthinkable might happen ... a nuclear conflict with the Soviet Union. In this movie, the tension is captured from the point of view of President Kennedy, his brother Bobby, the military leaders, and others in the seat of power. It starts with a report of a possible missile buildup in Cuba and the tension mounts as these reports crystalize into a confirmed fact. The Kennedy administration used both the carrot and the stick in negotiations as they were willing to make a few concessions to the Soviet Union while standing firm as to the consequences if the Soviet Union did not remove her missiles from the Carribean Island just 90 miles from our shores.The movie tends to lionize JFK and his brother Bobby. They were certainly less than perfect human beings but, their conduct during this crisis may have well been their finest hours. Accordingly, the glowing portrayal of them in this movie is justified. Also, I was not aware, until seeing this movie, that Adlai Stevenson was sought for advice but that ultimately, Stevenson could not be relied on, that JFK had to stand and make his own decisions. Of course, Stevenson did stand tall in his conduct on the floor of the United Nations (to the delight of a jubilant Kennedy Admisistration which had it's doubts) but the new generation of leadership, not Stevenson, had the forsight and resolve to get us through the perilous times.I remember well that as a nation, we put our trust in JFK to get us through the crisis and avert a launching of a nuclear attack by or against us. I was only 11 at the time but, I remember that despite the fears and rumors that we were at the brink of war, there was a confidence that things would work out despite Kennedy's earlier failure at the Bay of Pigs. This movie shows we were indeed at the brink of war and that there was indeed much pressure by military leaders and others in the administration for us to launch a first strike. In the end, the nation's trust that JFK would get us through the crisis was well placed.",5,Captures the tension,1001376000,"09 25, 2001",2001,3087,"['Recently', 'teenage', 'son', 'asked', 'horror', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'Pentagon', 'attacks', 'was', 'most', 'significant', 'event', 'lifetime', 'course', 'answer', 'quot', 'yes', 'quot', 'overshadowing', 'such', 'monumental', 'events', 'JFK', 'assasination', 'space', 'shuttle', 'explosion', 'Armstrong', 'setting', 'foot', 'moon', 'crisis', 'depicted', 'movie', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'Nontheless', 'Missile', 'crisis', 'was', 'monumentally', 'significant', 'event', 'movie', 'tension', 'remember', 'so', 'well.Some', 'reviewers', 'have', 'critcized', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'characterization', 'Kenny', ""O'Donnell"", 'noting', 'movie', 'greater', 'role', ""O'Donnell"", 'actually', 'played', 'also', 'noting', 'Costner', 'quot', 'Havad', 'quot', 'accent', 'was', 'overplayed', 'minor', 'concern', 'however', 'docudramas', 'often', 'need', 'protagonist', 'eyes', 'view', 'unfolding', 'drama', 'Costner', 'provide', 'eyes', 'viewers.What', 'striking', 'film', 'tension', 'felt', 'October', '1962', 'remember', 'was', 'indeed', 'concern', 'might', 'go', 'war', 'unthinkable', 'might', 'happen', 'nuclear', 'conflict', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'movie', 'tension', 'captured', 'point', 'view', 'President', 'Kennedy', 'brother', 'Bobby', 'military', 'leaders', 'others', 'seat', 'power', 'report', 'possible', 'missile', 'buildup', 'Cuba', 'tension', 'mounts', 'reports', 'crystalize', 'confirmed', 'fact', 'Kennedy', 'administration', 'used', 'carrot', 'stick', 'negotiations', 'were', 'willing', 'make', 'few', 'concessions', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'standing', 'firm', 'consequences', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'did', 'not', 'remove', 'missiles', 'Carribean', 'Island', 'just', '90', 'miles', 'shores.The', 'movie', 'lionize', 'JFK', 'brother', 'Bobby', 'were', 'certainly', 'less', 'perfect', 'human', 'beings', 'conduct', 'crisis', 'may', 'have', 'well', 'been', 'finest', 'hours', 'Accordingly', 'glowing', 'portrayal', 'movie', 'justified', 'Also', 'was', 'not', 'aware', 'seeing', 'movie', 'Adlai', 'Stevenson', 'was', 'sought', 'advice', 'ultimately', 'Stevenson', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'relied', 'JFK', 'had', 'stand', 'make', 'own', 'decisions', 'course', 'Stevenson', 'did', 'stand', 'tall', 'conduct', 'floor', 'United', 'Nations', 'delight', 'jubilant', 'Kennedy', 'Admisistration', 'had', 'doubts', 'new', 'generation', 'leadership', 'not', 'Stevenson', 'had', 'forsight', 'resolve', 'get', 'perilous', 'times.I', 'remember', 'well', 'nation', 'put', 'trust', 'JFK', 'get', 'crisis', 'avert', 'launching', 'nuclear', 'attack', 'was', 'only', '11', 'time', 'remember', 'fears', 'rumors', 'were', 'brink', 'war', 'was', 'confidence', 'things', 'would', 'work', 'out', 'Kennedy', 'earlier', 'failure', 'Bay', 'Pigs', 'movie', 'were', 'indeed', 'brink', 'war', 'was', 'indeed', 'much', 'pressure', 'military', 'leaders', 'others', 'administration', 'launch', 'first', 'strike', 'end', 'nation', 'trust', 'JFK', 'would', 'get', 'crisis', 'was', 'well', 'placed']",N/A
582575,A2MQQI4UYT9C11,B00005J760,David Zimmerman,"[2, 4]","Kevin Costner's gotten such a bad rap lately that I was a little nervous about this one (though I loved ""Bull Durham"" and have liked some other Costner flicks ""Field of Dreams"", ""Tin Cup"", ""Dances with Wolves"").  Costner produced and starred in this historical drama about the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962. Director Roger Donaldson gets great credit for creating a ""edge of the seat"" drama about events where the outcome is well known--JFK worked out a deal with Khruschev, the missiles went back to Russia, and Cuba remains anathema, albeit uninvaded, today.The suspense builds as JFK and his team figure out how to respond to the presence of nuclear missiles in Cuba that initially put about 100,000,000 Americans in the path of destruction.  The military favors a ""hit"", which is presented as the ""only solution"" on many occasions.  But JFK insists that another solution be developed, which eventually is unearthed by Secretary of Defense McNamara and then implemented with great uncertainty as to how it will work.High points are Bruce Greenwood's understated performance as JFK (he even works in the back problem); Steven Culp's eerie resemblance to and electric performance as RFK (Emilio Estevez should have cast him as ""Bobby"" and redone his lame film); and an equally fine performance from the actor playing McNamara (whom the casting, makeup and wardrobe people have captured perfectly).  We also get to see a ""Kennedy""--actor Christopher Lawford (son of Peter Lawford and Patricia Kennedy) as a Navy captain.Low points are Costner's annoying attempt at a Boston accent as he plays presidential aide and Harvard buddy Kevin O'Donnell (although the story is so engrossing that you soon are able to ignore it), and Donaldson's use of black-and-white film for several scenes (mostly near the beginning and end) for no apparent reason (maybe to give the movie a documentary feel--in any event, I thought it was unnecessary).  Exposure to the Soviet viewpoint is limited to a couple of scenes involving their UN Ambassador and Ambassador to the US.  We probably could have traded a couple of scenes with Costner's family for a ""look"" at the Soviet machinations during the crisis, which are depicted entirely as the subject of analysis and conjecture by the President, his aides, the CIA and the military.The movie also made me think of what a great idea it is to have civilian control of the military.  ""Cooler heads"", thinking with broader perspective than the mission-focused military brass, averted World War III and a possible nuclear catastrophe in this case.  Of course, it can cut the other way too, as the civilian leadership that started the current Iraq War has demonstrated.",4,"Whew, That Was Close!",1178236800,"05 4, 2007",2007,2698,"['Kevin', 'Costner', 'gotten', 'such', 'bad', 'rap', 'lately', 'was', 'little', 'nervous', 'one', 'loved', 'Bull', 'Durham', 'have', 'liked', 'other', 'Costner', 'flicks', 'Field', 'Dreams', 'Tin', 'Cup', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'Costner', 'produced', 'starred', 'historical', 'drama', 'Cuban', 'missile', 'crisis', 'October', '1962', 'Director', 'Roger', 'Donaldson', 'great', 'credit', 'creating', 'edge', 'seat', 'drama', 'events', 'where', 'outcome', 'well', 'known', 'JFK', 'worked', 'out', 'deal', 'Khruschev', 'missiles', 'went', 'back', 'Russia', 'Cuba', 'anathema', 'albeit', 'uninvaded', 'today.The', 'suspense', 'builds', 'JFK', 'team', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'respond', 'presence', 'nuclear', 'missiles', 'Cuba', 'initially', 'put', '100,000,000', 'Americans', 'path', 'destruction', 'military', 'favors', 'hit', 'presented', 'only', 'solution', 'many', 'occasions', 'JFK', 'solution', 'be', 'developed', 'eventually', 'unearthed', 'Secretary', 'Defense', 'McNamara', 'then', 'implemented', 'great', 'uncertainty', 'how', 'will', 'work.High', 'points', 'are', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'understated', 'performance', 'JFK', 'even', 'back', 'problem', 'Steven', 'Culp', 'eerie', 'resemblance', 'electric', 'performance', 'RFK', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'should', 'have', 'cast', 'Bobby', 'redone', 'lame', 'film', 'equally', 'fine', 'performance', 'actor', 'playing', 'McNamara', 'whom', 'casting', 'makeup', 'wardrobe', 'people', 'have', 'captured', 'perfectly', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'Kennedy', 'actor', 'Christopher', 'Lawford', 'son', 'Peter', 'Lawford', 'Patricia', 'Kennedy', 'Navy', 'captain.Low', 'points', 'are', 'Costner', 'annoying', 'attempt', 'Boston', 'accent', 'presidential', 'aide', 'Harvard', 'buddy', 'Kevin', ""O'Donnell"", 'story', 'so', 'engrossing', 'soon', 'are', 'able', 'ignore', 'Donaldson', 'use', 'black-and-white', 'film', 'several', 'scenes', 'mostly', 'beginning', 'end', 'apparent', 'reason', 'maybe', 'give', 'movie', 'documentary', 'feel', 'event', 'thought', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'Exposure', 'Soviet', 'viewpoint', 'limited', 'couple', 'scenes', 'involving', 'UN', 'Ambassador', 'Ambassador', 'US', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'traded', 'couple', 'scenes', 'Costner', 'family', 'look', 'Soviet', 'machinations', 'crisis', 'are', 'depicted', 'entirely', 'subject', 'analysis', 'conjecture', 'President', 'aides', 'CIA', 'military.The', 'movie', 'also', 'made', 'think', 'what', 'great', 'idea', 'have', 'civilian', 'control', 'military', 'Cooler', 'heads', 'thinking', 'broader', 'perspective', 'mission-focused', 'military', 'brass', 'averted', 'World', 'War', 'III', 'possible', 'nuclear', 'catastrophe', 'case', 'course', 'can', 'cut', 'other', 'way', 'too', 'civilian', 'leadership', 'started', 'current', 'Iraq', 'War', 'demonstrated']",N/A

Litton,"[2, 2]","As one who was born after the events in October 1962, I cannot begin to dismiss &quot;Thirteen Days&quot; on its historical accuracy, but, for someone who enjoys an intelligent movie that is able to get under my skin for two hours, I was pretty interested in the material. The movie is not merely about the near-fatal choices made during the events of the Cuban Missile Crisis, but also about the strength it takes to make the decisions that affect the outcome of a nation as well as the world itself.The subject of &quot;Thirteen Days&quot; is not one, but a series of events and happenings that come into play like a strategic game in which each player can only cross a certain line before the other becomes agitated and takes action. Beginning with shots of a U-2 plane flying over Cuba, a series of photographs is taken, and the extent of what is in those photos becomes clearer once they reach their intended target, Washington D.C., where President Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) gets his first glimpse of what it's like to be on the brink of war.Fears escalate as Kennedy, along with his brother, Robert (Steven Culp), and presidential aide Kenneth O'Donnell (Kevin Costner), begin hashing out possible plans for dealing with the crisis, which, at the time, was to remain confidential from all media sources. But, as all things do, the country soon realizes the danger it is in, and as millions of American citizens begin preparing themselves for disaster, our boys in Washington spend their days and nights in conference rooms and chambers trying to avert it.Roger Donaldson's film does for the Cuban Missile Crisis what Ron Howard's &quot;Apollo 13&quot; did for the devastating space mission that became one of the most heroic rescues in history. Done in the same textbook fashion, the movie goes through each turn of events so that there is no question about what is going on. Since we already know how the movie is going to end (or else I wouldn't be writing this review today), there is a small amount of intensity the film lacks, but what Donaldson is able to do is infuse each twist with a certain degree of intensity through his characters.This intensity that accompanies the film's sequence of events is more concerned with what decision the President will make rather than what will happen next. One right after another, David Self's script throws one pitfall after another at the President and his aides, from the building of missile launch sites in Cuba to the fact that Russian freighters are making their way across the Atlantic, with nuclear weapons possibly in tow. Each one of these possible threats to national security is met by at least ten different suggestions from different sides of the political arena as to the actions that should be taken in defense against them.So how does one handle such a large amount of pressure, especially when dealt from members of your own staff? The film is a character study of just how one deals with that stress. President Kennedy is a strong man in this film, and with the help of his brother Robert and aide O'Donnell, he is able to make decisions that he feels will bring to a halt the possibility of war. Here is a man with so much to deal with at once, and he is able to take it all in, analyze it, and make a decision that defines the true values of leadership and intelligence.The portrayals of these characters are given their due credit in some of the year's most Oscar-worthy performances. Kevin Costner is, as always, strong-willed and empowering, with just the right degree of emotion to keep his character human enough to believe in. Bruce Greenwood's President Kennedy is full of bravura and patriotism, one of the best portrayals of an American president in recent history. And Steven Culp is loyal and convincing as Robert Kennedy.The film's only major flaw is in its artistic elements, mainly centering on those black-and-white shots, which seem very out of place, and several captures of nuclear explosions, possibly meant to give the film a feeling of urgency and distress. Neither of these elements accomplishes what it was intended to, and may tend to wear thin after the first time they come into play.But despite its minute flaws, &quot;Thirteen Days&quot; is a history lesson told in textbook form, giving us event after event, and the ways in which each person who comes into play will solve them.

We have all heard of it, but few know the real issues that took place behind the scenes.  This movie takes us into Kennedy's Cabinet meetings to experience the true depth and danger of the challenge as well as the personal and philosophical conflicts that existed on all sides.  13 Days has a well developed script, and terrific performances by a very broad, solid cast.  A very enjoyable, and dynamic film.Most Kennedy re-enactment films come off really weak with poor imitation and bad accents.

When such a film grips the viewer thoroughly, it is a sure testament to great acting, directing, and writing.  Thirteen Days, like Ron Howard's Apollo 13, manages the task superbly, to the delight of triskaidekophiles everywhere.That certain liberties were taken with the historical facts should come as no surprise, as Hollywood's task is not accurate portrayal but fascinating storytelling.  Nevertheless, Thirteen Days maintains a reasonable link with the facts as they've been presented to the general public, although historians won't want to view this as a documentary.  Acting was superb throughout, with  Steven Culp as Robert Kennedy and Michael Fairman as Adlai Stevenson deserving of special mention.  Roger Donaldson's direction utilizes the odd camera angles so in vogue now, and distractingly attempts to blur the line between film and newsreel by moving from color to black-and-white, but is otherwise excellent.  And most important, of course, is the story itself--that strength need not only come from the gun; that armed conflict resolves little and demands far too much; and that men of good will, when given the opportunity, can resolve even the most intractable problems.  Perhaps Thirteen Days is no documentary, but instead a lesson to would-be leaders on the value of restraint.",5,Triskaidekophiles' Delight,999388800,"09 2, 2001",2001,1504,"['real', 'challenge', 'make', 'film', 'well-known', 'historical', 'fact', 'outcome', 'not', 'only', 'known', 'advance', 'most', 'audience', 'members', 'also', 'maintain', 'low', 'body', 'count', 'When', 'such', 'film', 'viewer', 'thoroughly', 'sure', 'testament', 'great', 'acting', 'directing', 'writing', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'Apollo', '13', 'task', 'superbly', 'delight', 'triskaidekophiles', 'certain', 'liberties', 'were', 'taken', 'historical', 'facts', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'Hollywood', 'task', 'not', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'fascinating', 'storytelling', 'Nevertheless', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'reasonable', 'link', 'facts', ""'ve"", 'been', 'presented', 'general', 'public', 'historians', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'view', 'documentary', 'Acting', 'was', 'superb', 'Steven', 'Culp', 'Robert', 'Kennedy', 'Michael', 'Fairman', 'Adlai', 'Stevenson', 'deserving', 'special', 'mention', 'Roger', 'Donaldson', 'direction', 'odd', 'camera', 'angles', 'so', 'vogue', 'now', 'distractingly', 'attempts', 'blur', 'line', 'film', 'newsreel', 'moving', 'color', 'black-and-white', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'most', 'important', 'course', 'story', 'strength', 'need', 'not', 'only', 'come', 'gun', 'armed', 'conflict', 'resolves', 'little', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'men', 'good', 'will', 'when', 'given', 'opportunity', 'can', 'resolve', 'even', 'most', 'intractable', 'problems', 'Perhaps', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'documentary', 'instead', 'lesson', 'would-be', 'leaders', 'value', 'restraint']",N/A

The drama focuses on the escalation of the crisis from the American viewpoint, as seen by Kevin Costner's character [Kenny O'Donnell], and the desperate political efforts to check it. At the same time, we see the ""Joint Chiefs of Staff"" seemingly conspiring to get the world into World War 3 for all the right reasons, if such a thing is possible. The pressure builds and we see what is happening in the Pentagon, the White House, in the air over Cuba, and in the Navy at sea enforcing a blockade. All in all, this is a quite large but coherent nutshell.BOTTOM LINE - -This is an excellent, suspense-driven thriller based, rather correctly, on historic facts. Once we get past Kevin Costner's attempt at a Boston accent, it all seems rather real. Bruce Greenwood as President John F. Kennedy depicts the former President's mannerisms and persona very believably and without getting sappy or fictionalizing too much. The same can be said for Steven Culp as Robert F. Kennedy, Dylan Baker as a fiery Robert McNamara, and Michael Fairman as a gutsy and unpopular [for being a dove] Adlai Stevenson.But, the real kudos have to go to the men that very frighteningly represented the ""Joint Chiefs"". Kevin Conway as General Curtis LeMay appeared to be the ultimate Cold Warrior with his let's-get-ready-to-rumble attitude from the get-go. Bill Smitrovich as General Maxwell Taylor played the more reasonable among the unreasonable. He gave the President and the Cabinet the impression at every turn that time and their options were running out in a way that would have made Alfred Hitchcock proud.ALSO CONSIDER VIEWING - -THE MISSLES OF OCTOBER, FAIL SAFE, SEVEN DAYS IN MAY, THE BEDFORD INCIDENT and THE FOG OF WAR, all available on DVD.ABOUT THE DVD - -I have not explored the features yet, but the Widescreen Transfer is impeccable in both sight and sound.LIST OF FEATURES - -Available Audio Tracks: English (Dolby Digital 5.1)Commentary by: Kevin Costner, director Roger Donaldson, writer David Self, and executive producer Michael De Luca;Historical Commentary - John F.

582589,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B00005J760,D. S. Thurlow,"[1, 1]","""Thirteen Days"" is an exciting and well-crafted retelling of the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962, loosely based on former Attorney General Robert Kennedy's book. The crisis, like much of the Cold War, has largely passed out of living memory, but it brought the U.S. and the Soviet Union to the brink of nuclear war over the placement of Soviet nuclear-tipped missiles in Castro's Cuba.Bruce Greenwood as President John F. Kennedy and Steven Culp as Attorney General and Presidential brother Robert Kennedy are almost disturbingly well-cast as the leading U.S. actors in the drama, which is told from the point of view of Presidential Assistant Kenneth O'Donnell, played by Kevin Costner. The real life O'Donnell is not known to have played a significant role in the crisis, but his larger role as portrayed by Costner works well as a dramatic device. The other actors are a collection of TV and movie supporting actors who adequately fill their roles as administration, military, and congressional leaders. The movie does a nice job recreating period fashion, vehicles and other details. Archival footage from the crisis helps enhance the sense of realism of the story and the dramatic tension.At the heart of the movie are the deliberations of the Executive Committee, or ExCom, a group of administration personnel handpicked by the President to work options for resolving the crisis. Over thirteen days, the strong personalities of the ExCom wrestle with tough options and each other, hoping to find some insight for a President facing an opponent whose motives and plans are obscure.

582591,A2E6LOTVXW8X2P,B00005J760,E A Glaser,"[1, 4]","I could have given ""Thirteen Days"" more stars if it weren't for a shot of JFK as the Cuban Missile Crisis is heating up, looking out the window of his office at children playing on the White House lawn, just to remind us all of what's REALLY at stake here.  Come on -- is it necessary to thump people over the head with the consequences of a nuclear exchange?  This kind of unnecessary drama-building detracted from the movie, in my opinion.  Another example is that bits of the movie were shot in black-and-white, just to remind us of how serious a historical event this was.Like another reviewer, this movie reminded me of ""Glengarry Glen Ross"", in that the heart of the movie is about a conflict between adamant men -- John and Robert Kennedy are trying to steer the Cuban Missile Crisis away from an armed conflict, while the Joint Chiefs are scappin' for a fight and hope to escalate the situation.  There are lots of expensive-looking shots in ""Thirteen Days"" that I thought only detracted from the story.  We find out on the filmmaker's commentary track that they used some actual ships from the period during the blockade scenes, and there is a graceful but superfluous scene where a brave American pilot climbs into the upper atmosphere to evade anti-air missiles.  If I had made ""Thirteen Days"", it would have cost 1/20 as much and like ""Glen Ross"" would have consisted solely of the conversations between the protagonists, and been more focused on the true conflict as a result.Because of these dramatic devices I was skeptical of the historical accuracy of the movie, and I know that the role of Kevin Costner's friend-of-the-Kennedys character is inflated to provide a window into the lives of John and Bobby.  I was therefore pleased to hear on the commentary track that the source material drew directly from the White House tapes that captured the original conversations as they happened, so the movie's depiction of how close America came to bombing Cuba and escalating towards World War III rings frighteningly true.The actors who play John and Robert Kennedy do a good job of portraying strong, principled men who still harbor doubts about themselves and their ability to make the right decision.  To be honest, I have a negative gut reaction to the glowing light in which the movie depicts the Kennedys; I wasn't alive in the 60's so I have no way of knowing if they were really as saintly as people give them credit for, but my impression is that their stratospheric reputations have been inflated by time and sympathy.  Either way, though, I am pleased that a nuclear showdown was averted at the time and give them credit for navigating an extremely delicate situation when they were operating with patchy information and fighting against both the Russians and the warmongering American generals.Long story short: ""Thirteen Days"" has too many Hollywood-hero moments but was still fascinating for its insights into the way the U.S. responded to the Cuban missile threat, and also increased my respect for the Kennedys (no small task, skeptic that I am).

In addition to that, I had a course in crisis management last spring, that dealt largely with the Cuban Missile Crisis and I thought it was a good opportunity to see a visual version of the events I had learned about.Q: How did you find it?A: It is a very serious film; there was almost no comical relief; I felt like I was seeing an intense documentary, like those in the History Channel, only this time it was a complete Hollywoodian remake (set aside some original shootings). The latter means distinguished Hollywood actors, the main cast's emotional involvement, struggles and doubts in ""real time,"" and high budget naval and air action scenes.Q: What could you overall comment about the crew?A: Everybody was very committed to his or her work; You could feel the tension within and between the characters, in the face of such intense crisis, that almost dragged the world to third world war.Q: In particular, how did Bruce Greenwood portray JFK?A: I think he did a great job ; I could feel the horrible stress he was under and ,my god, I forget about any former plans to run for office. His performance helped me to better understand the pressure the decision-maker endures day by day, and especially while in the midst of multi-national crisis .Q: What about Kevin Costner?A: He was the actor with the longest part of acting, apparently due to his stature and experience as an actor. Some say his role and impact on the events was enhanced to suit his ""leading actor""demands, I say -  so what? I really don't care that the film is not 100% accurate, it&#65533;s not its target; I got an impressive production on a major important historical event, and I that's what I wanted.Q: I've heard the movie contained black and white sequences and A-bombs explosions  ""what's the purpose, and was it necessary?""A: I think everything was in place ; The b/w sequences were used to create a sense of the sixties atmosphere and to help American old timers to relive that era. The explosions (that were spectacular, by the way) served to demonstrate what could have happened should Kennedy and his close staff weren't in charge at the White House.Q: Any special features of the DVD you have found helpful?A: You bet. There is a comprehensive review of all the main characters. It is interesting to know some facts about their life and who they were after seeing the movie. The commentaries of the director and the other makers is less appealing, not to say boring.Q: Why did you give it only 3 stars?A: Because it's not the word of the providence, but a good functional film, well done, with no new ground shaking moral or emotional unprecedented climax.Q: Whom would you recommend this movie?A: For everyone who is interested in the recent history of the American nation, and of the entire world ,for that matter. It's a rare glimpse of the occurrences that are taking place in the offices of our leaders worldwide when things get rough. Maybe the nuclear threat is not as imminent as it was then, but we all know the world is not a better place today, not by a long shot.",3,Historical experience.,1001548800,"09 27, 2001",2001,3332,"[""'ve"", 'based', 'review', 'questions', 'may', 'ask', 'answers', 'may', 'reply', 'hoping', ""'ll"", 'find', 'form', 'presentation', 'helpful.Question', 'Why', 'did', 'pick', 'movie', 'up', 'Answer', 'truth', 'had', 'spare', 'time', 'thought', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'choice', 'addition', 'had', 'course', 'crisis', 'management', 'last', 'spring', 'largely', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'opportunity', 'see', 'visual', 'version', 'events', 'had', 'learned', 'about.Q', 'How', 'did', 'find', 'very', 'serious', 'film', 'was', 'almost', 'comical', 'relief', 'felt', 'was', 'seeing', 'intense', 'documentary', 'History', 'Channel', 'only', 'time', 'was', 'complete', 'Hollywoodian', 'remake', 'set', 'aside', 'original', 'shootings', 'latter', 'means', 'distinguished', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'main', 'cast', 'emotional', 'involvement', 'struggles', 'doubts', 'real', 'time', 'high', 'budget', 'naval', 'air', 'action', 'scenes.Q', 'What', 'could', 'overall', 'comment', 'crew', 'Everybody', 'was', 'very', 'committed', 'work', 'could', 'feel', 'tension', 'characters', 'face', 'such', 'intense', 'crisis', 'almost', 'dragged', 'world', 'third', 'world', 'war.Q', 'particular', 'how', 'did', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'portray', 'JFK', 'think', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'could', 'feel', 'horrible', 'stress', 'was', 'god', 'forget', 'former', 'plans', 'run', 'office', 'performance', 'helped', 'better', 'understand', 'pressure', 'decision-maker', 'endures', 'day', 'day', 'especially', 'midst', 'multi-national', 'crisis', '.Q', 'What', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'was', 'actor', 'longest', 'part', 'acting', 'apparently', 'due', 'stature', 'experience', 'actor', 'say', 'role', 'impact', 'events', 'was', 'enhanced', 'suit', 'leading', 'actor', 'demands', 'say', 'so', 'what', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'film', 'not', '100', '%', 'accurate', '65533', 'not', 'target', 'got', 'impressive', 'production', 'major', 'important', 'historical', 'event', 'what', 'wanted.Q', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'movie', 'contained', 'black', 'white', 'sequences', 'A-bombs', 'explosions', 'what', 'purpose', 'was', 'necessary', 'think', 'everything', 'was', 'place', 'b/w', 'sequences', 'were', 'used', 'create', 'sense', 'sixties', 'atmosphere', 'help', 'American', 'old', 'timers', 'relive', 'era', 'explosions', 'were', 'spectacular', 'way', 'served', 'demonstrate', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'should', 'Kennedy', 'close', 'staff', 'were', ""n't"", 'charge', 'White', 'House.Q', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'have', 'found', 'helpful', 'bet', 'comprehensive', 'review', 'main', 'characters', 'interesting', 'know', 'facts', 'life', 'who', 'were', 'seeing', 'movie', 'commentaries', 'director', 'other', 'makers', 'less', 'appealing', 'not', 'say', 'boring.Q', 'Why', 'did', 'give', 'only', '3', 'stars', 'not', 'word', 'providence', 'good', 'functional', 'film', 'well', 'done', 'new', 'ground', 'shaking', 'moral', 'emotional', 'unprecedented', 'climax.Q', 'Whom', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'everyone', 'who', 'interested', 'recent', 'history', 'American', 'nation', 'entire', 'world', 'matter', 'rare', 'glimpse', 'occurrences', 'are', 'taking', 'place', 'offices', 'leaders', 'worldwide', 'when', 'things', 'get', 'rough', 'Maybe', 'nuclear', 'threat', 'not', 'as', 'imminent', 'was', 'then', 'know', 'world', 'not', 'better', 'place', 'today', 'not', 'long', 'shot']",N/A

When a U-2 spy plane photographed the installation of Soviet ballistic missiles on the island of Cuba, the United States and its president John F. Kennedy were faced with a monumental dilemma: how to force the Soviets to withdraw the missiles without touching off World War III.  That is the story ingeniously told in the terribly underrated political drama THIRTEEN DAYS, one of the best films of that type since ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN.Seen through the eyes of JFK presidential adviser Kenneth O'Donnell (Kevin Costner), THIRTEEN DAYS is a fascinating look at the machinations that went on in the highest circles of power in Washington during that traumatic time known as the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Bruce Greenwood, known prior to this for playing bad guys (DOUBLE JEOPARDY; RULES OF ENGAGEMENT), gives an extremely credible portrayal of John Kennedy, who finds himself caught between a rock and a hard place.  On one side are the Joint Chiefs of Staff, led by staunch Cold Warriors General Max Taylor and Dean Acheson, pushing for an invasion and surgical strike against the missiles.  On the other is the president's own conscience, for he knows that anything as rash as what the Joint Chiefs are leaning hard on could mean the end of life on Earth.Alongside Greenwood's sterling performance, Steven Culp portrays his brother Bobby Kennedy with the right tact and straight-forward believability.  Costner's heavy Boston accent is not always credible, but this is only a minor flaw in his performance as Ken O'Donnell, which is otherwise quite good.  A true standout performance is Michael Fairman's portrayal of UN ambassador Adlai Stevenson, a former presidential candidate and an old ""political cat"" who denounces the Soviet Union's stonewalling at the United Nations in front of the world--""Yes or No?! Don't bother to wait for the translation""; ""I'm prepared to stay here until Hell freezes over, if that's what it takes!""David Self's screenplay is very cagily based on White House tapes, documents, and memos from that two-week edge-of-the-seat rollercoaster ride the human race had to endure.  It all comes together under the crisp, taut direction of Roger Donaldson, who directed Costner in 1987's NO WAY OUT.  Even though it is a rather long film at 146 minutes, it plays like Great American theatre, the kind that Hollywood has somehow left behind in its rush for big bucks.Like any film drama based on real events, besides the slight fictionalizations, a person's knowledge of these events might make THIRTEEN DAYS predictable.  But the reason these kinds of films work is not so much the end result as to finding out how the end result was achieved.  That is the real triumph of this movie, and why it ranks very close to ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, in my book.",5,On The Brink,1031270400,"09 6, 2002",2002,2875,"['October', '1962', 'world', 'came', 'closer', 'nuclear', 'extinction', 'ever', 'had', 'would', 'again', 'When', 'U-2', 'spy', 'plane', 'photographed', 'installation', 'Soviet', 'ballistic', 'missiles', 'island', 'Cuba', 'United', 'States', 'president', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'were', 'faced', 'monumental', 'dilemma', 'how', 'force', 'Soviets', 'withdraw', 'missiles', 'touching', 'off', 'World', 'War', 'III', 'story', 'ingeniously', 'told', 'terribly', 'underrated', 'political', 'drama', 'THIRTEEN', 'DAYS', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'type', 'THE', 'PRESIDENT', 'MEN.Seen', 'eyes', 'JFK', 'presidential', 'adviser', 'Kenneth', ""O'Donnell"", 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'THIRTEEN', 'DAYS', 'fascinating', 'look', 'machinations', 'went', 'highest', 'circles', 'power', 'Washington', 'traumatic', 'time', 'known', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'known', 'prior', 'playing', 'bad', 'guys', 'DOUBLE', 'JEOPARDY', 'RULES', 'OF', 'ENGAGEMENT', 'extremely', 'credible', 'portrayal', 'John', 'Kennedy', 'who', 'caught', 'rock', 'hard', 'place', 'one', 'side', 'are', 'Joint', 'Chiefs', 'Staff', 'led', 'staunch', 'Cold', 'Warriors', 'General', 'Max', 'Taylor', 'Dean', 'Acheson', 'pushing', 'invasion', 'surgical', 'strike', 'missiles', 'other', 'president', 'own', 'conscience', 'anything', 'as', 'rash', 'what', 'Joint', 'Chiefs', 'are', 'leaning', 'hard', 'could', 'mean', 'end', 'life', 'Earth.Alongside', 'Greenwood', 'sterling', 'performance', 'Steven', 'Culp', 'brother', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'right', 'tact', 'straight-forward', 'believability', 'Costner', 'heavy', 'Boston', 'accent', 'not', 'always', 'credible', 'only', 'minor', 'flaw', 'performance', 'Ken', ""O'Donnell"", 'otherwise', 'quite', 'good', 'true', 'standout', 'performance', 'Michael', 'Fairman', 'portrayal', 'UN', 'ambassador', 'Adlai', 'Stevenson', 'former', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'old', 'political', 'cat', 'who', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'stonewalling', 'United', 'Nations', 'front', 'world', 'Yes', 'Do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'wait', 'translation', ""'m"", 'prepared', 'stay', 'here', 'Hell', 'what', 'David', 'Self', 'screenplay', 'very', 'cagily', 'based', 'White', 'House', 'tapes', 'documents', 'memos', 'two-week', 'edge-of-the-seat', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'human', 'race', 'had', 'endure', 'together', 'crisp', 'taut', 'direction', 'Roger', 'Donaldson', 'who', 'directed', 'Costner', '1987', 'WAY', 'OUT', 'Even', 'rather', 'long', 'film', '146', 'minutes', 'Great', 'American', 'theatre', 'kind', 'Hollywood', 'somehow', 'left', 'behind', 'rush', 'big', 'bucks.Like', 'film', 'drama', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'slight', 'fictionalizations', 'person', 'knowledge', 'events', 'might', 'make', 'THIRTEEN', 'DAYS', 'predictable', 'reason', 'kinds', 'films', 'work', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'end', 'result', 'finding', 'out', 'how', 'end', 'result', 'was', 'achieved', 'real', 'triumph', 'movie', 'why', 'very', 'close', 'THE', 'PRESIDENT', 'MEN', 'book']",N/A
582597,A1PQLR0EN31PE8,B00005J760,E. Smith,"[1, 6]","A political thriller starring Kevin Costner about the Cuban Missile Crisis during Kennedy's administration.  Costner, who seems to envision himself as the third Kennedy,  is the Special Political Advisor to the president.  I mean, if we are to believe what we see here, he is the real hero of the Cuban missile crisis.  He saved the world from getting into a nuclear battle.  This film is kind of a yawner with too much camera time spent on Costner and that enormous melon he calls a head.  His accent is irritating at best.  He character wants so much to be a Kennedy.  It seems that the Kennedy's can't make a move or a decision without the advice of this guy.  I don't know if this was true or not about this guy, it just seem Costner (who long movies are hard to take) makes it seem so.  Costner is not a character that wants to be a Kennedy, it's COSTNER who WANTS to be a Kennedy.  COSTNER has this hero worship wannabe in practically every LONG movie that he is in (and most of the short ones).  He loves having the camera on him which makes this picture suffer.  There are some wonderful actors in this movie but they hardly get screen time.  The film should be called 13 Days of Kevin Costner's enormous ego.  Now to other cast members.  Bruce Greenwood does a good job playing JFK, but since the picture isn't about him, we don't get to see too much of him in action as president.  I mean, all the important calls are made by Costner.  Stephen Culp could be mistaken for Robert Kennedy.  If you have ever seen footage of Robert Kennedy, you would think that you were watching the actual former Attorney General on screen here.  This was the most convincing performance even right down to the accent.  This film is way longer than it needs to be.  About 30 minutes into the film I looked at my watch, then looked at it again 30 minutes later, and one last time with about 20-30 minutes to go in the picture.  It's not a bad picture, but it's certainly nothing to write home about.  You will not be on the edge of your seat and they had all the tools to get you that way.  If the camera spent less time on Costner and more time away from Ego-tripper, perhaps this film would have been more enjoyable.  Every since the much deserved success of Dances With Wolves, Costner seems to think that people only want to see him in screen.

I am old enough to remember the Cuban Missile Crisis very well.  I also tend toward the conservative side in political views.Thirteen Days is a good movie.  From a dramatic standpoint it is a success.  Bruce Greenwood I thought did a particularly good job as JFK.  I think the speech and manners were well done and his general bearing and tone are convincing.  The supporting cast, for the most part, is good to very good.  I was particularly impressed with  Len Cariou, in a minor role as  Dean Acheson.  I had not been previously aware of this actor.Kevin Costner has been criticized for a bad accent and a stiff performance.  I thought that the script overplayed his role in the Crisis.  Perhaps this was because his star status demanded more lines?  And I am not able to accept the almost saint-like image that the role gives to his portrayal of JFK assistant Kenny O'Donnell.  At times the camera time seems to give the impression that Costner/O'Donnell is the focus of the film.This was all a bit distracting but not serious enough to wreck a good dramatic effort.  The characters and the script are all well delivered and believable.  Even though you know the outcome the tension and suspense work.  It is good cinema.As for historical accuracy the overall effect gives JFK a hero aura.  In one sense he deserves this.  It was a serious crisis and he got out reasonably clean without war.  On the other hand all that he he had previously done badly, which undoubtedly contributed to Kruschev's willingness to take the risks, were simply not mentioned.In addition Hollywood consistently portrays the military in the poorest light.  They didn't fail us here.  General Curtis LeMay is portrayed as little short of an overbearing, arrogant savage.  Admiral George Anderson comes across as a pompous man who fails utterly to understand the geopolitical aspects of the naval blockade action.A good show if you are looking for entertainment.  If you looking for history read the relevant history first.  So armed this film will help bring it to life for you.",3,Entertainment yes!

582599,A2E0CB9F9BMXUJ,B00005J760,"Eugene Wei ""eugene""","[76, 85]","I remember studying the Cuban Missile Crisis in college, in a class on group dynamics and groupthink. It is such a remarkably involving event, I was a bit apprehensive going into the film, as Hollywood often manages to suck the life out of inherently thrilling stories. Luckily, they get this one right. While it is not historically accurate, I didn't care, because the story this film tells preserves the essence of the event, the tension in the White House as two superpowers danced at the edge of World War III, and the type of individual heroism and leadership it probably took to save us from ourselves.The story is told from the perspective of Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner), given an inflated role as the advisor to President Kennedy and confidant of both John and Bobby. Telling the story from his perspective is a good one, as it allows us to view John and Bobby as the larger than life heroes they were. Costner's faux Bostonian accent is so lousy as to cause hysterical laughter from my friends and I as the film started, but thankfully Bruce Greenwood and Steven Culp outshine him with remarkably charismatic portrayals of John and Bobby. I wasn't alive when Kennedy was president, but after watching Greenwood's performance I can understand why so many look to Kennedy as our last great president. Surrounded by military chiefs of staff rabid to go to war with the Russians, the Kennedy's and O'Donnell find the courage to follow their better judgment and inspire enough decent men around them to steer both sides to a peaceful resolution. This is filmmaking about the clash of strong personalities in a group setting, like Twelve Angry Men, or Glengarry Glen Ross, or Fail Safe. I find the subject fascinating.A few other minor quibbles: occasionally the film switches to black and white, ostensibly to heighten the sense of historical accuracy, but it just looked like we were watching a studio screener copy of the film to me. That could have been left out. Also, occasionally the director Roger Donaldson inserts scenes with O'Donnell hanging out with his family, brooding over their well-being, with head in hand and furrowed brow. They feel like attempts to conjure up some of the tension that common American families felt during the event, but Costner no longer has the dramatic presence to pull them off, and I would have preferred Donaldson narrow his focus to stay within the confines of the White House.But those are minor quibbles. Dylan Baker plays Defense Secretary Robert McNamara wonderfully, and it's amazing how much Culp and Baker resemble Bobby Kennedy and McNamara. I left the film wishing that presidential candidates like George Bush or Al Gore had half the charisma of Greenwood's JFK. Ah, but isn't that always the case with presidents in the movies? If you find yourself fascinated by the Cuban Missile Crisis after watching the film, pick up the book from which some of the film's events were pulled, &quot;The Kennedy Tapes: Inside the White House During the Cuban Missile Crisis.&quot; It provides a more historically accurate and just as compelling examination of the event.",4,"Gripping drama, even if not entirely accurate",979689600,"01 17, 2001",2001,3119,"['remember', 'studying', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'college', 'class', 'group', 'dynamics', 'groupthink', 'such', 'remarkably', 'involving', 'event', 'was', 'bit', 'apprehensive', 'going', 'film', 'Hollywood', 'often', 'suck', 'life', 'inherently', 'thrilling', 'stories', 'Luckily', 'get', 'one', 'right', 'not', 'historically', 'accurate', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'story', 'film', 'essence', 'event', 'tension', 'White', 'House', 'two', 'superpowers', 'danced', 'edge', 'World', 'War', 'III', 'type', 'individual', 'heroism', 'leadership', 'probably', 'took', 'save', 'ourselves.The', 'story', 'told', 'perspective', 'Kenny', ""O'Donnell"", 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'given', 'inflated', 'role', 'advisor', 'President', 'Kennedy', 'confidant', 'John', 'Bobby', 'Telling', 'story', 'perspective', 'good', 'one', 'view', 'John', 'Bobby', 'larger', 'life', 'heroes', 'were', 'Costner', 'faux', 'Bostonian', 'accent', 'so', 'lousy', 'cause', 'hysterical', 'laughter', 'friends', 'film', 'started', 'thankfully', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'Steven', 'Culp', 'remarkably', 'charismatic', 'portrayals', 'John', 'Bobby', 'was', ""n't"", 'alive', 'when', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'president', 'watching', 'Greenwood', 'performance', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'look', 'Kennedy', 'last', 'great', 'president', 'Surrounded', 'military', 'chiefs', 'staff', 'rabid', 'go', 'war', 'Russians', 'Kennedy', ""O'Donnell"", 'find', 'courage', 'follow', 'better', 'judgment', 'inspire', 'enough', 'decent', 'men', 'steer', 'sides', 'peaceful', 'resolution', 'filmmaking', 'clash', 'strong', 'personalities', 'group', 'setting', 'Twelve', 'Angry', 'Men', 'Glengarry', 'Glen', 'Ross', 'Fail', 'Safe', 'find', 'subject', 'fascinating.A', 'few', 'other', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'occasionally', 'film', 'black', 'white', 'ostensibly', 'heighten', 'sense', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'just', 'looked', 'were', 'watching', 'studio', 'screener', 'copy', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'Also', 'occasionally', 'director', 'Roger', 'Donaldson', 'scenes', ""O'Donnell"", 'hanging', 'out', 'family', 'brooding', 'over', 'well-being', 'head', 'hand', 'furrowed', 'brow', 'feel', 'attempts', 'conjure', 'up', 'tension', 'common', 'American', 'families', 'felt', 'event', 'Costner', 'no', 'longer', 'dramatic', 'presence', 'pull', 'off', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'Donaldson', 'narrow', 'focus', 'stay', 'confines', 'White', 'House.But', 'are', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'Dylan', 'Baker', 'Defense', 'Secretary', 'Robert', 'McNamara', 'wonderfully', 'amazing', 'how', 'much', 'Culp', 'Baker', 'resemble', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'McNamara', 'left', 'film', 'wishing', 'presidential', 'candidates', 'George', 'Bush', 'Al', 'Gore', 'had', 'charisma', 'Greenwood', 'JFK', 'Ah', ""n't"", 'always', 'case', 'presidents', 'movies', 'find', 'fascinated', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'watching', 'film', 'pick', 'up', 'book', 'film', 'events', 'were', 'pulled', 'quot', 'Kennedy', 'Tapes', 'White', 'House', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis.', 'quot', 'more', 'historically', 'accurate', 'just', 'compelling', 'examination', 'event']",N/A

Kevin Costner is the star of the film, but the ensemble of actors and their combined performances is incredibly impressive, thus Costner really underplaying his role to great effect, really bolsters the effect of this very well made film. These actors push the narrative of the film and keep it moving. Bruce Greenwood as John F. Kennedy, when I look at this film, really takes that script and combines it with his insightful and restrained yet powerful portrayal of JFK. Watching this film is like watching history happen all over again.  I thought it was that good. The acting, the entire cast was very good. I can't stress that. There are so many scenes of meetings with different members involved in the decision making of this crisis that you can pick out different character actors and just watch their faces with the intensity of the moment. For instance, great character actor Ed Lauter playing General Marshall Carter, is in several scenes. I don't know if he even has one word of dialogue, but his presence is noticed and it really ads to the quality and enhancement of the narrative. And there is Christopher Lawford playing pilot Commander William B. Ecker who has to make another flyover over Cuban missile sites and has special instructions from the white house to see that the situation is not escalated. There are so many scenes of detail that all contribute to this time in history that you come away impressed by what men trying to do their duty with honor and dignity had to endure and had to rise to a level of performance that the free world depended on, and not just the free world, the entire world.

It was suspenseful and exciting.  The acting was genuine.  The effects were good.The problem was the foul language, especially taking God's name in vain.  The name of God and Jesus Christ were used as slang or in cursing many times.  I excepted some swearing/profanity, but not to this extent.It's ironic that the movie shows the president and his immediate advisors going to a catholic church multiple times.  They need God's help, but they repeatedly curse the very God that can help them.  In fact, they really don't want God's help...church is only a facade or tradition...they don't know God, although they may claim to.  Read 2 Timothy 3:1-5, and notice verse 5.At the end of the movie, while admiring a sunrise after the crisis is adverted, Costner's character says ""Every day the sun comes up says something about us"".  THAT'S WRONG.  This life is not about us...it is about GOD.  Every day the sun comes up says something about GOD and HIS MERCY.

582608,A2XBBQ36STNJ0G,B00005J760,here_is_your_review,"[1, 2]","Though the Egyptian, Syrian and Jordanian attack on the Israelis in the Yom Kippur War of October, 1973 (another ""Missiles of October"", eh?) was perhaps the closest we came to nuclear war recently, October, 1962 was definitely the most frightening for Americans.  This film is an excellent docu-drama on those events.That being said, let me get my few complaints outta the way first.  I like Kevin Costner, but the accent was a mistake.  It comes and goes and is somewhat distracting.Also, while starting the film in black and white gives the fade to historical events a retro feel, it should have been done only once, at the beginning and fade in the color for the rest of the film, as many films have done.  The director kept using this technique and it's also distracting, like turning a light switch on and off while watching TV (or a fading signal).The DVD is somewhat akward to navigate and the options are also limited, in regard to languages and subtitles.On the plus side, the special effects are pretty good, including those of the U-2's in flight, the accuracy of the aircraft (B-52's, A-4's, F-4's, A-7's, etc.) though the A-7's are obviously not running but use camera angles and towed aircraft to simulate taxiing.  CGI is used for many of the flight scenes as with the U-2 flight sequences.  Bruce Greenwood does a decent job as President Kennedy.  And the actors who portrayed McGeorge Bundy,  Robert McNamara, Bobby Kennedy (whose accent also slips a bit), General Curtis LeMay, and Pierre Salinger are also excellently cast.  In fact, casting was very good for this film.Overall it's a great film.  It has a PG rating for language and I'm not sure current American generations will really understand the gravity of the situation portrayed in the film.  It's also an interesting look at President Kennedy, who only had 13 more months to live (November, 1963), ending in yet another dramatic episode of 1960's America.  And then Bobby Kennedy would die in 1968, assassinated by Palestinian gunman Sirhan Sirhan.Despite the flaws, I recommend the film as it captures the events and the mood of 1962 nicely.",4,The Nuclear Showdown with the Russians,1117065600,"05 26, 2005",2005,2121,"['Egyptian', 'Syrian', 'Jordanian', 'attack', 'Israelis', 'Yom', 'Kippur', 'War', 'October', '1973', 'Missiles', 'October', 'eh', 'was', 'perhaps', 'closest', 'came', 'nuclear', 'war', 'recently', 'October', '1962', 'was', 'definitely', 'most', 'frightening', 'Americans', 'film', 'excellent', 'docu-drama', 'being', 'said', 'let', 'get', 'few', 'complaints', 'way', 'first', 'like', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'accent', 'was', 'mistake', 'somewhat', 'distracting.Also', 'starting', 'film', 'black', 'white', 'fade', 'historical', 'events', 'retro', 'feel', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'only', 'once', 'beginning', 'fade', 'color', 'rest', 'film', 'many', 'films', 'have', 'done', 'director', 'kept', 'using', 'technique', 'also', 'distracting', 'turning', 'light', 'switch', 'watching', 'TV', 'fading', 'signal', '.The', 'DVD', 'somewhat', 'akward', 'navigate', 'options', 'are', 'also', 'limited', 'regard', 'languages', 'subtitles.On', 'plus', 'side', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'including', 'U-2', 'flight', 'accuracy', 'aircraft', 'B-52', 'A-4', 'F-4', 'A-7', 'etc', 'A-7', 'are', 'obviously', 'not', 'running', 'use', 'camera', 'angles', 'towed', 'aircraft', 'simulate', 'taxiing', 'CGI', 'used', 'many', 'flight', 'scenes', 'U-2', 'flight', 'sequences', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'decent', 'job', 'President', 'Kennedy', 'actors', 'who', 'portrayed', 'McGeorge', 'Bundy', 'Robert', 'McNamara', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'accent', 'also', 'bit', 'General', 'Curtis', 'LeMay', 'Pierre', 'Salinger', 'are', 'also', 'excellently', 'cast', 'fact', 'casting', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'film.Overall', 'great', 'film', 'PG', 'rating', 'language', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'current', 'American', 'generations', 'will', 'really', 'understand', 'gravity', 'situation', 'portrayed', 'film', 'also', 'interesting', 'look', 'President', 'Kennedy', 'who', 'only', 'had', '13', 'more', 'months', 'live', 'November', '1963', 'ending', 'yet', 'dramatic', 'episode', '1960', 'America', 'then', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'would', 'die', '1968', 'assassinated', 'Palestinian', 'gunman', 'Sirhan', 'Sirhan.Despite', 'flaws', 'recommend', 'film', 'events', 'mood', '1962', 'nicely']",N/A

If you are doing a historical film, then use the detonation when there is one, like when the U.S. did a test during the crisis.  Any other image would just confuse the viewer.The film also uses some footage of Walter Cronkite talking about the crises.  I must admit that this was a very nice touch.  This was in black and white whereas the rest of the movie was mostly color.Kevin Costner, playing Ken O'Donnell, speaks with a thick Massachusetts accent, but oddly his accent is much thicker than the ones used for JFK or Bobby Kennedy.  I don't know if this is historically accurate, but it seems a bit odd.In all, I would recommend watching this movie if you have an interest in American history.",4,The Cuban Missile Crisis,1035763200,"10 28, 2002",2002,1277,"['reading', 'bit', 'presidency', 'JFK', 'decided', 'watch', 'movie', 'get', 'more', 'dramatic', 'feel', 'what', 'happened', 'part', 'American', 'history', 'was', 'fairly', 'good', 'film', 'purpose', 'are', 'parts', 'where', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'overdoing', 'bit.The', 'movie', 'footage', 'nuclear', 'detonations', 'Perhaps', 'bit', 'much', 'illustrate', 'point', 'what', 'parties', 'involved', 'crisis', 'were', 'flirting', 'What', 'puzzled', 'was', 'other', 'images', 'detonations', 'occur', 'different', 'parts', 'movie', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'are', 'doing', 'historical', 'film', 'then', 'use', 'detonation', 'when', 'one', 'when', 'U.S.', 'did', 'test', 'crisis', 'other', 'image', 'would', 'just', 'confuse', 'viewer.The', 'film', 'also', 'footage', 'Walter', 'Cronkite', 'talking', 'crises', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'touch', 'was', 'black', 'white', 'whereas', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'mostly', 'color.Kevin', 'Costner', 'playing', 'Ken', ""O'Donnell"", 'thick', 'Massachusetts', 'accent', 'oddly', 'accent', 'much', 'thicker', 'ones', 'used', 'JFK', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'historically', 'accurate', 'bit', 'odd.In', 'would', 'recommend', 'watching', 'movie', 'have', 'interest', 'American', 'history']",N/A
582622,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B00005J760,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[3, 4]","For thirteen tense days in October, 1962, the United States and the Soviet Union teetered on the brink of nuclear war.  The Soviets had placed intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Cuba.  These missiles were capable of striking much of the United States and Latin America.  Alerted to the presence of the missiles by a U-2 spy plane photograph, President John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood), Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy (Steven Culp) and the joint chiefs of staff begin to chart a course to avoid a catastrophic nuclear war.The movie is told through the eyes of Presidential aide Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner).  Aside from Costner's obviously fake Bostonian accent, the design works quite well.  By telling the story through O'Donnell's eyes, it allows the viewer to focus more on JFK, RFK, and the development of the crisis.Directed by Costner as well, the movie describes the entire crisis, from start to finish. From the first discovery of the missiles by the U-2, through the agonizingly long two weeks of decisions and negotiations, to the final outcome, this movie covers all the bases.  I do wish that more attention would have been paid to the Soviet side of the crisis.  I believe that the film would have been more complete had this occurred.The acting throughout the film is excellent.  Bruce Greenwood gives a compelling and exciting performance as John F. Kennedy, while Steven Culp is equally as good as JFK's younger brother Bobby.  Costner himself is again at his best as O'Donnell, and Michael Fairman does a wonderful job as the embattled Adlai Stevenson, who stands up to the Soviets at the U.N. with his famous ""hell freezes over"" quote.I give this movie my highest recommendation. October, 1962 was a tense time for the world, and this great movie does a fine job of depicting the missile crisis.  As with its earlier predecessor ""The Missiles of October"", this film describes exactly how close the world came to nuclear war.",5,On the Edge of the Abyss,1176336000,"04 12, 2007",2007,1954,"['thirteen', 'tense', 'days', 'October', '1962', 'United', 'States', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'teetered', 'brink', 'nuclear', 'war', 'Soviets', 'had', 'placed', 'intermediate-range', 'nuclear', 'missiles', 'Cuba', 'missiles', 'were', 'capable', 'striking', 'much', 'United', 'States', 'Latin', 'America', 'Alerted', 'presence', 'missiles', 'U-2', 'spy', 'plane', 'photograph', 'President', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'Attorney', 'General', 'Robert', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'Steven', 'Culp', 'joint', 'chiefs', 'staff', 'begin', 'chart', 'course', 'avoid', 'catastrophic', 'nuclear', 'war.The', 'movie', 'told', 'eyes', 'Presidential', 'aide', 'Kenny', ""O'Donnell"", 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Aside', 'Costner', 'obviously', 'fake', 'Bostonian', 'accent', 'design', 'quite', 'well', 'telling', 'story', ""O'Donnell"", 'eyes', 'viewer', 'focus', 'more', 'JFK', 'RFK', 'development', 'crisis.Directed', 'Costner', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'entire', 'crisis', 'start', 'finish', 'first', 'discovery', 'missiles', 'U-2', 'agonizingly', 'long', 'two', 'weeks', 'decisions', 'negotiations', 'final', 'outcome', 'movie', 'bases', 'do', 'wish', 'more', 'attention', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'paid', 'Soviet', 'side', 'crisis', 'believe', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'complete', 'had', 'occurred.The', 'acting', 'film', 'excellent', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'compelling', 'exciting', 'performance', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'Steven', 'Culp', 'equally', 'as', 'good', 'JFK', 'younger', 'brother', 'Bobby', 'Costner', 'again', 'best', ""O'Donnell"", 'Michael', 'Fairman', 'wonderful', 'job', 'embattled', 'Adlai', 'Stevenson', 'who', 'up', 'Soviets', 'U.N.', 'famous', 'hell', 'over', 'quote.I', 'give', 'movie', 'highest', 'recommendation', 'October', '1962', 'was', 'tense', 'time', 'world', 'great', 'movie', 'fine', 'job', 'depicting', 'missile', 'crisis', 'earlier', 'predecessor', 'Missiles', 'October', 'film', 'exactly', 'how', 'close', 'world', 'came', 'nuclear', 'war']",N/A

Still, it's an intresting perspective on the events of the Cuban missile crisis.  Although I'm not a historian, it's obvious that the film makers want to glorify JFK and his handling of the situation.  In reality, he and his administration did a good job of keeping us out of WW3 and I do believe the Military was pushing for an attack to redeem themselves for the Bay of Pigs fiasco.  But lets not forget it was under his administration that the Bay of Pigs even happened, that's never really touched on.  He also had a problem with infidelity to his wife, the man was not the peaceful saint that most movies make him out to be.  Costner gives a decent performance, although being one of the producers I'm sure he had a hand in expanding the role of Kenny O'Donnell to give himself more to do.  In addition, his Boston accent shows us why he didn't try the britsh accent in Robin Hood, it's teeth clenchingly bad.  Thankfully, it seems to tone down as the movie goes on.

The very fact that the film's makers have managed to overcome this handicap tells me that they've done a top-drawer job.It's 1962, and the Executive Branch of the U.S. government has learned that the Soviets have installed nuclear ballistic missiles 90 miles off Florida in Cuba. THIRTEEN DAYS is ostensibly a behind-the-scenes look at how America's leaders dealt with the dilemma. Kevin Costner has top billing as Kenny O'Donnell, an advisor to President Kennedy, played by Bruce Greenwood. Other roles of particular note are Steven Culp as Attorney General Robert Kennedy, Dylan Baker as Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, and Kevin Conway as Air Force General Curtis LeMay. (Fans of Jackie Kennedy can forget it. Her character is all but invisible.)The best performance is by Greenwood as the President, the actor having reportedly studied file footage of Kennedy to get his mannerisms down. He did well, and is very believable. Culp is quite effective as Jack's protective Brother Bobby, and Conway is chilling as the Air Force chief who would just as soon nuke the USSR back into the Stone Age. And Costner is ... well, Costner - with a Boston accent. The core of the film is comprised of the Washington scenes, while the relatively brief military action sequences serve as plot anchors, and the balance is just right.The exactitude of the historical details as portrayed in the storyline is debatable. (One hopes that nobody would expect to view a completely accurate rendition of history in any Hollywood big-budget production. Puhleeze!) But, in this case, it doesn't really matter. The moviegoer is completely absorbed into the action and strained decision-making of the moment as the Oval Office struggles to get Krushchev's bombs out of Cuba, and dodge Armageddon in the process. The pre-knowledge that no World War Three resulted is virtually irrelevant to the viewing experience.

Corn ""reviewer""","[4, 6]","I'll go on record as saying this may be the finest film I've seen about the Cuban Missle Crisis, with the possible exception of actual film and news coverage from the time. If you're wondering WHY on earth you'd want to see a film about a historical even that has been analyzed, discussed and written about (some would say to death), the answer is this - this film offers a unique, gripping and special perspective on the Cuban Missle Crisis. Even if you lived through this period in our nation's history (as I did), I urge you to see this one. It is truly a classic study of leaders coping under the most intense, urgent pressure imaginable - and thinking admirably well on their feet.  We watched this one with our 17 year old son and the experience was definitely different for all three of us. My husband and I remembered how frightened our parents had been during the Curban Missle Crisis and even remembered such details as the drawn, anxious face of newsman Walter Cronkite (shown in this film) as he kept the country up to date on the ongoing drama. Our son, on the other hand, had a whole different perspective but was equally fascinated and riveted by this film. He glimpsed what it was like for our country to be on the brink of nuclear war - and from his reaction, I think it was a sobering, enlightening experience for him.  Be forewarned, there are some controversial sections in this film. The main focus and perspective of the film is that of presidential aide Kenneth O' Donnell (played by Kevin Costner) and there is also an emphasis on the Kennedys saving the world from the military's ambitious war plans. yet there is also a serious commitment to historical detail and accuracy in most areas of the film that make up for any flaws.

This becomes an upheaval for the United States government as they realize that they might be on the brink of World War III.  President John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) must decide what plan of action that US must take as he gets help from his brother Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy (Steven Culp) and Political Advisor Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner).  During the governmental negotiations it becomes apparent that some want to bomb Cuba without hesitation or consideration of what it might lead to.  In the shadows of the scheming politicians and military personnel O'Donnell must take action and find a way to avoid any military conflicts as they might lead to the end of the world.  Thirteen Days is based on the real events that took place in the US and Cuba in October, 1962, and even if the audience knows the outcome of these events the film offers a suspenseful cinematic experience.  Donaldson decided to film in color and intermittently shoot in black and white, which enhances the realism of the story.  In addition, the use of archived films from the time when the events took place adds support to the film's realistic feel, which in the end offers a good cinematic experience.",4,Suspenseful cinematic experience...,1081900800,"04 14, 2004",2004,1369,"['Aerial', 'photos', 'taken', 'U-2', 'spy', 'plane', 'reveal', 'Soviets', 'have', 'moved', 'nuclear', 'long', 'range', 'missiles', 'Cuba', 'agreement', 'U.S.A', 'Russia', 'upheaval', 'United', 'States', 'government', 'realize', 'might', 'be', 'brink', 'World', 'War', 'III', 'President', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'must', 'decide', 'what', 'plan', 'action', 'US', 'must', 'take', 'help', 'brother', 'Attorney', 'General', 'Robert', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'Steven', 'Culp', 'Political', 'Advisor', 'Kenny', ""O'Donnell"", 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'governmental', 'negotiations', 'apparent', 'want', 'bomb', 'Cuba', 'hesitation', 'consideration', 'what', 'might', 'lead', 'shadows', 'scheming', 'politicians', 'military', 'personnel', ""O'Donnell"", 'must', 'take', 'action', 'find', 'way', 'avoid', 'military', 'conflicts', 'might', 'lead', 'end', 'world', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'US', 'Cuba', 'October', '1962', 'even', 'audience', 'outcome', 'events', 'film', 'suspenseful', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'Donaldson', 'decided', 'film', 'color', 'intermittently', 'shoot', 'black', 'white', 'realism', 'story', 'addition', 'use', 'archived', 'films', 'time', 'when', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'support', 'film', 'realistic', 'feel', 'end', 'good', 'cinematic', 'experience']",N/A

Bernabo,"[6, 8]","I had heard that the Infinifilm Edition of &quot;Thirteen Days&quot; was impressive, but I have never seen this many DVD extras loaded onto ONE DISC.  The second time you watch the film and enable the features it will take you at least five hours to get through everything.  With Infinifilm you get mini-menus that pop up and over you the opportunity to see news footage about a specific event, biographical clips on the key participants, or historical commentary.  Or you can simply engage subtitles that present historical facts and insights throughout the film. The list of possibilities is so extensive I can only hint at it here.  This is without getting into two commentary tracks, the first offering Kevin Costner, director Roger Donaldson, writer David Self, and executive producer Michael De Luca and the second, a &quot;historical&quot; commentary,&quot; provided by John F. Kennedy, Sergei Khrushchev (Nikita's son), Ernest R. May, Philip D. Zelikow and Pierre Salinger and excerpts from key historical speeches.  &quot;Thirteen Days&quot; is geared towards the historian more than the film buff, so while there is a short feature on &quot;Bringing History to the Silver Screen,&quot; there is a length one of the &quot;Roots of the Cuban Missile Crisis.&quot;  However, there is a visual effects scene deconstruction that gets into a little bit of movie magic and the requisite deleted scenes and trailer.What about the actual movie, which covers the same ground as the TV film &quot;The Missiles of October?&quot;  I read Bobby Kennedy's book &quot;Thirteen Days&quot; a long time ago and the thing I remember the most was about the brainstorming sessions and RKF's critical suggestion to just ignore the second letter.  My main complaint about the film is the same as most people who know about the history of the Cuban Missile Crisis, which is that the role of Kenny O'Donnell, Special Advisor to the President, is built up because Kevin Costner is playing the role.  When RFK goes to have the pivotal meeting with Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin and the camera stays outside of the office so we can watch O'Donnell whistle, I was about to have a stroke.  Fortunately the camera ended up in the AG's office for the critical scene, but they had me worried.  Bruce Greenwood stands out as JFK by avoiding any semblance of caricature (I should point out that Costner really does under play the real O'Donnell's Bahstan accent).  &quot;Thirteen Days&quot; is one of the most historically accurate films I have seen and while its dramatic impact will have to do with how much you know/remember about the Cuban Missile Crisis, the educational impact of the Ininifilm extras is an absolute joy.

582639,A2AVSKPLMDEBJT,B00005J760,"LILyte Review ""Mercy""","[5, 26]","For me, this movie was very annoying watching Kevin Costner contrived attempted at adopting a Boston accent in playing the part of Kenny O'Donnell. This is an insult to every Bostonian and those who lives around there and I know this for a fact since I was born and raised in Mass for most of my life before i moved to Cali. Do i still have an accent, yes i do. Do i sound like the character in this movie, heck no!!! And neither does anyone else with a Boston accent. The movie would of been better off if he had just talk normally, and not trying to make fun of an accent when it is surely obvious that he cannot adopt it. I guess being a coproducer of this movie and his big recognizeable name that it gives him the right to make a joke out of every Boston citizens. Those who give this movie 5 star has no idea what a Bostonian sound like but would just go 'oh that sounds cool'. Those who are knowledgeable knows better then to give 5 stars since they feel annoyed as well. Now JFK boston voice is acceptable and convincing but his part is small compare to Kenny's, whom in reality never had that much say in the White House like he did in this movie. If he had talked back to the kennedy's like that, he would be looking for another job in no time. But you have to remember, it's played by Kevin Costner and he deserve to have the spotlight on him because it's an ego thing with big name actors. How many times did we see the first lady, Jackie, in this movie compare to Kenny's wife? I rest my case. If you want to enjoy a very accurate account of the missle crisis and with no fake accent, then watch ""The Missiles of October"" which I highly recommend. If you are the type who has no clue what a bostonian sound like and enjoy hearing an annoying accent throughout the whole movie, then you will enjoy '13 Days'.",1,Kevin Costner boston accent....You got to be kidding!?!,1039219200,"12 7, 2002",2002,1820,"['movie', 'was', 'very', 'annoying', 'watching', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'contrived', 'attempted', 'adopting', 'Boston', 'accent', 'playing', 'part', 'Kenny', ""O'Donnell"", 'insult', 'Bostonian', 'who', 'know', 'fact', 'was', 'born', 'raised', 'Mass', 'most', 'life', 'i', 'moved', 'Cali', 'Do', 'i', 'still', 'have', 'accent', 'yes', 'i', 'do', 'Do', 'i', 'sound', 'character', 'movie', 'heck', 'anyone', 'else', 'Boston', 'accent', 'movie', 'would', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'just', 'talk', 'normally', 'not', 'trying', 'make', 'fun', 'accent', 'when', 'surely', 'obvious', 'can', 'not', 'adopt', 'guess', 'being', 'coproducer', 'movie', 'big', 'recognizeable', 'name', 'right', 'make', 'joke', 'Boston', 'citizens', 'who', 'give', 'movie', '5', 'star', 'idea', 'what', 'Bostonian', 'sound', 'would', 'just', 'go', ""'oh"", 'cool', 'who', 'are', 'knowledgeable', 'knows', 'better', 'then', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'feel', 'annoyed', 'well', 'Now', 'JFK', 'boston', 'voice', 'acceptable', 'convincing', 'part', 'small', 'compare', 'Kenny', 'whom', 'reality', 'never', 'had', 'much', 'say', 'White', 'House', 'did', 'movie', 'had', 'talked', 'back', 'kennedy', 'would', 'be', 'looking', 'job', 'time', 'have', 'remember', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'deserve', 'have', 'spotlight', 'ego', 'thing', 'big', 'name', 'actors', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'did', 'see', 'first', 'lady', 'Jackie', 'movie', 'compare', 'Kenny', 'wife', 'rest', 'case', 'want', 'enjoy', 'very', 'accurate', 'account', 'missle', 'crisis', 'fake', 'accent', 'then', 'watch', 'Missiles', 'October', 'highly', 'recommend', 'are', 'type', 'who', 'clue', 'what', 'bostonian', 'sound', 'enjoy', 'hearing', 'annoying', 'accent', 'whole', 'movie', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', ""'13"", 'Days']",N/A
582640,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00005J760,Linda Linguvic,"[0, 1]","Having just visited the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum, I was very anxious to see this video about the Cuban missile crisis in 1962.  After all, I had just seen a short documentary film on the same subject just a few days before. To review everyone's memory, there was a real threat of nuclear war at the time when photos revealed that the Russians had missiles in place in Cuba aimed at the United States.  It called for much diplomacy and courage on the part of JFK in order to avert the crisis and, as the outcome was positive, the incident has become a footnote in the history books. Therefore,  I must give some credit to the filmmakers for wanting to bring this incident to public awareness so that we can all be thankful for what didn't happen.First and foremost, Kevin Costner is the star.  No, he doesn't have the role of JFK who is played by Bruce Greenwood.  No, he doesn't have the role of Bobby Kennedy, who is played by Steven Culp.  Kevin Costner is cast as Kenny O'Donnell, a special advisor to the President who actually did exist. It is doubtful, however, that O'Donnell had the huge role in influencing the President as the film implies.  And while there was probably a lot of soul searching on the part of all parties in making decisions, it is unlikely that their conversations would sound like late 20th century &quot;sensitive&quot; men who had lived through the human potential movement and had all had years of therapy.  President Kennedy and his brother Bobby come across as mere shadows of the men I remember.  How could they ever have achieved their place in history without some degree of leadership and decisiveness?  This film makes it seem like the Kevin Costner character orchestrated their every move.  For example, at one point in the film when JFK is worried that he will be late in making his television address, the Kevin Costner character says, &quot;You're the President for goodness sakes, you can be a few minutes late.&quot;The cinematography, while good during the scenes of aircraft over Cuba, is lacking in other ways.  For example, there are scenes in black and white and then there are scenes in color.  Usually when a film does this, the black and white scenes tend to be newsreels, but in this film I never could figure out the reason for them.  Also, too many scenes took place within the same room in the White House. As the incident is an historical fact, it was hard for the filmmakers to show the tension.  They did a good job of it though by showing  the conflicting values of the old guard military men and the new administration. And they did a good job when recreating the actual encounter been Adlai Stevenson and the Russian delegates during debate in the U.N.  But otherwise, there was just too much talk. And speaking about &quot;talk&quot;, I cringed at their Boston accents.  None of the major actors seemed to get it, and Costner least of all.  Of course it is impossible to recreate every detail of the historical time period, but they tried hard.  Stephanie Romanov, who had a small role as Jacqueline Kennedy, looked just like her.  But it was only after I looked at the credits for the cast that I see that there was an actor cast in the role of Lyndon B. Johnson.  Throughout the film, I wondered where he was and have a faint recollection of one of the men around the table saying one line with a Texas accent.  Could it be true that the Vice President of the United States was virtually non-existent?I must remember though that this movie never attempts to be a documentary. However, it does attempt to portray an actual event.  And I can't help wondering whether Kevin Costner had history re-written especially for him. My recommendation?

582642,A1TWTULVD6F22O,B00005J760,"L. Quido ""quidrock""","[1, 1]","What a gem of a DVD!  Worthy of 5 stars for its tremendous special features (the infini version), with a well-filmed and directed effort at creating a visual and compelling drama from history, the film fails only in a few casting errors and the use of black and white sequences, which are distracting.The script allows a relatively minor player in the Kennedy administration, Kenny O'Donnell, to be elevated to the most trusted advisor status in order to enhance the story (and to create a role big enough to give Costner top billing).  Now, I know that 13 days could not have had as good a showing in theaters, or even on video without some star quality in the O'Donnell role, but like most viewers, I believe that Costner was a poor choice.  Once you have gotten past Costner and his accent, you are free to concentrate on the excellent ensemble performances that compel this &quot;showdown&quot; drama to the end.I was a child during this period of history and can remember some blurry visuals of the incident, and also a melancholy that surrounded me as the adults in my life tried to cope with what might have been.  Far from the high impact area of the weapons, I can imagine the fright and the tension felt in my new home, the state of Florida.  Since most of our history books today breeze through much of the detail surrounding the cold war, &quot;13 Days&quot; will provide an interesting backdrop and tool for our serious educators to demonstrate the fear of the times to today's students.  It is also an excellent film, like the current &quot;West Wing&quot; on television, to illustrate how much behind the scenes negotiation and personal drama are the backdrops for seemingly clearcut issues addressed by the President on a daily basis.With the exception of Costner, the cast is a miraculous collection of personalities you have seen before in many roles.  Their willingness to take these small parts and build the fine ensemble you see is testimony to how few roles of substance we have today for fine, older supporting actors.  Particularly notable are Greenwood and Culp as the Kennedys, Dylan Baker as McNamara, Kevin Conway as General LeMay, Michael Fairman as the much maligned Adlai Stevenson, and the always delightful Len Cariou, who you may not even recognize because he has become Dean Acheson.Director Donaldson has a clean, crisp, diverting and riveting style of switching from scene to scene, and the air and sea patrol scenes, interspersed with the White House, are top-notch. Music plays a strong but lesser role throughout the film, and it is obvious that the directors and producers had a well thought out plan for the DVD production.  There is not a single special feature that is not worth watching (even the discussion with Costner, much more palatable when he is not in the O'Donnell role).One of the really terrific elements of the film is the strong portrayal of just how primitive the communication industry was at the time.....scenes of frantic telephone operators, offices without personal computers, teletype machines and the time it took to channel overseas communication all tell us how we have launched ourselves into the 21st century with our telecommunication tools.A movie to watch again and again...think I'll buy the DVD!",4,"I made the mistake of renting, rather than buying....",996451200,"07 30, 2001",2001,3271,"['What', 'gem', 'DVD', 'Worthy', '5', 'stars', 'tremendous', 'special', 'features', 'infini', 'version', 'well-filmed', 'directed', 'effort', 'creating', 'visual', 'compelling', 'drama', 'history', 'film', 'only', 'few', 'casting', 'errors', 'use', 'black', 'white', 'sequences', 'are', 'distracting.The', 'script', 'relatively', 'minor', 'player', 'Kennedy', 'administration', 'Kenny', ""O'Donnell"", 'be', 'elevated', 'most', 'trusted', 'advisor', 'status', 'order', 'enhance', 'story', 'create', 'role', 'big', 'enough', 'give', 'Costner', 'top', 'billing', 'Now', 'know', '13', 'days', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'good', 'showing', 'theaters', 'even', 'video', 'star', 'quality', ""O'Donnell"", 'role', 'most', 'viewers', 'believe', 'Costner', 'was', 'poor', 'choice', 'Once', 'have', 'gotten', 'past', 'Costner', 'accent', 'are', 'free', 'concentrate', 'excellent', 'ensemble', 'performances', 'compel', 'quot', 'quot', 'drama', 'end.I', 'was', 'child', 'period', 'history', 'can', 'remember', 'blurry', 'visuals', 'incident', 'also', 'melancholy', 'surrounded', 'adults', 'life', 'tried', 'cope', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Far', 'high', 'impact', 'area', 'weapons', 'can', 'imagine', 'fright', 'tension', 'felt', 'new', 'home', 'state', 'Florida', 'most', 'history', 'books', 'today', 'breeze', 'much', 'detail', 'surrounding', 'cold', 'war', 'quot', '13', 'Days', 'quot', 'will', 'provide', 'interesting', 'backdrop', 'tool', 'serious', 'educators', 'demonstrate', 'fear', 'times', 'today', 'students', 'also', 'excellent', 'film', 'current', 'quot', 'West', 'Wing', 'quot', 'television', 'illustrate', 'how', 'much', 'scenes', 'negotiation', 'personal', 'drama', 'are', 'backdrops', 'seemingly', 'clearcut', 'issues', 'addressed', 'President', 'daily', 'basis.With', 'exception', 'Costner', 'cast', 'miraculous', 'collection', 'personalities', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'roles', 'willingness', 'take', 'small', 'parts', 'build', 'fine', 'ensemble', 'see', 'testimony', 'how', 'few', 'roles', 'substance', 'have', 'today', 'fine', 'older', 'supporting', 'actors', 'Particularly', 'notable', 'are', 'Greenwood', 'Culp', 'Kennedys', 'Dylan', 'Baker', 'McNamara', 'Kevin', 'Conway', 'General', 'LeMay', 'Michael', 'Fairman', 'much', 'maligned', 'Adlai', 'Stevenson', 'always', 'delightful', 'Len', 'Cariou', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'even', 'recognize', 'become', 'Dean', 'Acheson.Director', 'Donaldson', 'clean', 'crisp', 'diverting', 'riveting', 'style', 'switching', 'scene', 'scene', 'air', 'sea', 'patrol', 'scenes', 'interspersed', 'White', 'House', 'are', 'top-notch', 'Music', 'strong', 'lesser', 'role', 'film', 'obvious', 'directors', 'producers', 'had', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'plan', 'DVD', 'production', 'not', 'single', 'special', 'feature', 'not', 'worth', 'watching', 'even', 'discussion', 'Costner', 'much', 'more', 'palatable', 'when', 'not', ""O'Donnell"", 'role', '.One', 'really', 'terrific', 'elements', 'film', 'strong', 'portrayal', 'just', 'how', 'primitive', 'communication', 'industry', 'was', 'time', '..scenes', 'frantic', 'telephone', 'operators', 'offices', 'personal', 'computers', 'teletype', 'machines', 'time', 'took', 'channel', 'overseas', 'communication', 'tell', 'how', 'have', 'launched', '21st', 'century', 'telecommunication', 'tools.A', 'movie', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'think', ""'ll"", 'buy', 'DVD']",N/A

Though it proports to tell the true and unknown story of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the television movie, MISSILES OF OCTOBER did it much better and with a better cast.  Had the producers sought to explain the Bay of Pigs crisis even with a &quot;Star Wars&quot;-type rolling introduction, the movie might have made more sense.  Instead what we have is a mess in which the virtuous Kennedy Brothers overcome the evil machinations of the military.  Wisely Kevin Costner does not play either Bobby or Jack, but attempts to portray Kenny O'Donnell whose duties involved a variety of domestic considerations.  Unfortunately there is none of THAT in this movie.  Kenny's sole duties appear to be to whistle a happy tune in times of stress at the Russian embassy. Meanwhile the evil military leaders attempt to start WWIII.  They hate the Kennedys and storm through the White House clenching cigars and muttering about the Kennedys as though they were George McGovern presiding over the admission of gays into the military after slashing the Department of Defense budget.  Since Bobby had the presence of mind to name one of his many children after one of these thugs in uniform, this can't be the way that this happened.  Why is it that the producers of this movie sought to cover up the fact that in those days, doves did not inhabit the White House, nor could they hope to get elected.  Kennedy did gleefully preside over one of the largest arms build ups in post-war history.  But I guess in Hollywood's eyes, no one that attractive could ever be anything more than true blue.  The producers did not understand the relationship between the executive and the military in so many ways, it would be tedious to go further.Another omission is the lack of anything on the Russians.  The Cold War is over and there is so much material available to use.  At least MISSILES OF OCTOBER included a few scenes with Khrushchev.  The subject matter offered so much potential for a capable dramatist and able producers, it is a pity that this movie fails so completely on so many counts.",2,13 is an unlucky number,994550400,"07 8, 2001",2001,2151,"['Rarely', 'movie', 'been', 'made', 'more', 'embarassing', 'gafes', 'one', 'tell', 'true', 'unknown', 'story', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'television', 'movie', 'MISSILES', 'OF', 'OCTOBER', 'did', 'much', 'better', 'better', 'cast', 'Had', 'producers', 'sought', 'explain', 'Bay', 'Pigs', 'crisis', 'even', 'quot', 'Star', 'Wars', 'quot', 'rolling', 'introduction', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'Instead', 'what', 'have', 'mess', 'virtuous', 'Kennedy', 'Brothers', 'overcome', 'evil', 'machinations', 'military', 'Wisely', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'not', 'play', 'either', 'Bobby', 'Jack', 'attempts', 'portray', 'Kenny', ""O'Donnell"", 'duties', 'involved', 'variety', 'domestic', 'considerations', 'Unfortunately', 'none', 'movie', 'Kenny', 'sole', 'duties', 'appear', 'be', 'whistle', 'happy', 'tune', 'times', 'stress', 'Russian', 'embassy', 'Meanwhile', 'evil', 'military', 'leaders', 'attempt', 'start', 'WWIII', 'hate', 'Kennedys', 'storm', 'White', 'House', 'clenching', 'cigars', 'muttering', 'Kennedys', 'were', 'George', 'McGovern', 'presiding', 'admission', 'gays', 'military', 'slashing', 'Department', 'Defense', 'budget', 'Bobby', 'had', 'presence', 'mind', 'name', 'one', 'many', 'children', 'one', 'thugs', 'uniform', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'way', 'happened', 'Why', 'producers', 'movie', 'sought', 'cover', 'up', 'fact', 'days', 'doves', 'did', 'not', 'inhabit', 'White', 'House', 'could', 'hope', 'get', 'elected', 'Kennedy', 'did', 'gleefully', 'preside', 'one', 'largest', 'arms', 'build', 'ups', 'post-war', 'history', 'guess', 'Hollywood', 'eyes', 'one', 'attractive', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'anything', 'more', 'true', 'blue', 'producers', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'relationship', 'executive', 'military', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'would', 'be', 'tedious', 'go', 'further.Another', 'omission', 'lack', 'anything', 'Russians', 'Cold', 'War', 'so', 'much', 'material', 'available', 'use', 'least', 'MISSILES', 'OF', 'OCTOBER', 'included', 'few', 'scenes', 'Khrushchev', 'subject', 'matter', 'offered', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'capable', 'dramatist', 'able', 'producers', 'pity', 'movie', 'so', 'completely', 'so', 'many', 'counts']",N/A

582647,A2B6VI9MQI0WKI,B00005J760,Matthew Gladney,"[22, 28]","'Thirteen Days' is one well-done political thriller. It is based on the events concerning the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, when the U.S. discovered that the Soviet Union was using nearby Cuba as a missile base. Threats ensued, tensions escalated, and even war seemed like a horrific possibility.The film stars Steven Culp as Bobby Kennedy, Bruce Greenwood as a relatively convincing John F. Kennedy, and Kevin Costner as a right-hand man to the President, a sort of advisor, to keep focus and make sure things didn't tumble out of control. Costner does a good job here. He plays stern men very well, and so is perfectly suited for the role. Some have quibbled that his Bostonian accent is bad, but I judge the performance on more merits than if the voice is dead-on or not. That leads us to Bruce Greenwood as JFK. His looks and mannerisms come across quite superbly as the young President which we have pictured in our minds. The *voice* is a somewhat off, but why quibble? He's an actor, not necessarily an impressionist.The film is directed well - very starkly, with well-placed camera angles and good cuts between scenes. The other performances in the picture are good, especially the representation of Adlai Stevenson. His famous scene in the United Nations is re-created with stirring pride, and does the tension of the real event justice. Other scenes are handled well: the running of the blockade, the communications between JFK and Kruschev, and the meetings between Kennedy and his advisors.'Thirteen Days' is meant to be a tight, engrossing thriller, and it succeeds quite admirably in that endeavor. The performances and the direction are above par. Its historical accuracy is, I'm sure, flawed in certain areas (most &quot;based on real life&quot; movies are), but it excels in bringing forth the tension that must have existed at the time. If there is one slight drawback to the film, it is that the Kennedys are portrayed as nearly perfect men. There is a great deal of nostalgia for the &quot;Camelot&quot; period of time, and JFK most certainly was a decent man, but here he and his brother are illustrated to be brave, noble, better and above all the rest. It is one of the few times the movie smacks of being somewhat slanted. But that is a forgivable view. This is a movie about one of our darkest hours, and the strong men who shone brightly through it.We all know that everything turned out ok, that there was no war, that we thankfully live in a free society which feels a little safer due in part to the events dramatized in 'Thirteen Days'. It would be good to read a well-respected history book to get the cold facts on the matter, but if you're looking for a good exposition of the raw emotions involved, then be sure to watch this intense film.",4,Watch an engrossing political drama unfold...,994809600,"07 11, 2001",2001,2773,"[""'Thirteen"", 'Days', 'one', 'well-done', 'political', 'thriller', 'based', 'events', 'concerning', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', '1962', 'when', 'U.S.', 'discovered', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'was', 'using', 'nearby', 'Cuba', 'missile', 'base', 'Threats', 'ensued', 'tensions', 'escalated', 'even', 'war', 'seemed', 'horrific', 'possibility.The', 'film', 'stars', 'Steven', 'Culp', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'relatively', 'convincing', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'right-hand', 'man', 'President', 'sort', 'advisor', 'keep', 'focus', 'make', 'sure', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'tumble', 'control', 'Costner', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'stern', 'men', 'very', 'well', 'so', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'role', 'have', 'quibbled', 'Bostonian', 'accent', 'bad', 'judge', 'performance', 'more', 'merits', 'voice', 'dead-on', 'not', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'JFK', 'looks', 'mannerisms', 'come', 'quite', 'superbly', 'young', 'President', 'have', 'pictured', 'minds', '*voice*', 'somewhat', 'off', 'why', 'quibble', 'actor', 'not', 'necessarily', 'impressionist.The', 'film', 'directed', 'well', 'very', 'starkly', 'well-placed', 'camera', 'angles', 'good', 'cuts', 'scenes', 'other', 'performances', 'picture', 'are', 'good', 'especially', 'representation', 'Adlai', 'Stevenson', 'famous', 'scene', 'United', 'Nations', 're-created', 'stirring', 'pride', 'tension', 'real', 'event', 'justice', 'Other', 'scenes', 'are', 'handled', 'well', 'running', 'blockade', 'communications', 'JFK', 'Kruschev', 'meetings', 'Kennedy', 'advisors', ""'Thirteen"", 'Days', 'meant', 'be', 'tight', 'engrossing', 'thriller', 'quite', 'admirably', 'endeavor', 'performances', 'direction', 'are', 'par', 'historical', 'accuracy', ""'m"", 'sure', 'flawed', 'certain', 'areas', 'most', 'quot', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'quot', 'movies', 'are', 'bringing', 'tension', 'must', 'have', 'existed', 'time', 'one', 'slight', 'drawback', 'film', 'Kennedys', 'are', 'portrayed', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'men', 'great', 'deal', 'nostalgia', 'quot', 'Camelot', 'quot', 'period', 'time', 'JFK', 'most', 'certainly', 'was', 'decent', 'man', 'here', 'brother', 'are', 'illustrated', 'be', 'brave', 'noble', 'better', 'rest', 'one', 'few', 'times', 'movie', 'smacks', 'being', 'somewhat', 'slanted', 'forgivable', 'view', 'movie', 'one', 'darkest', 'hours', 'strong', 'men', 'who', 'shone', 'brightly', 'it.We', 'know', 'everything', 'turned', 'out', 'ok', 'was', 'war', 'thankfully', 'live', 'free', 'society', 'little', 'safer', 'due', 'part', 'events', 'dramatized', ""'Thirteen"", 'Days', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'read', 'well-respected', 'history', 'book', 'get', 'cold', 'facts', 'matter', ""'re"", 'looking', 'good', 'exposition', 'raw', 'emotions', 'involved', 'then', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', 'intense', 'film']",N/A
582648,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005J760,Matthew Horner,"[2, 4]","I was not looking forward to seeing Thirteen Days because its subject is the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. This event was easily among the top ten darkest moments in mankind's history, and I didn't want to see it trivialized, sanitized or rewritten simply for the purposes of entertainment. I am happy to report that this did not happen. The movie is true to the story, at least insofar as a screenplay can be accurate. A movie is forced to compact historical events and to alter them to a degree so that a logical and interesting story can unfold. The highest comment I can pay the movie is that I was riveted. After all, I knew how it ended.For those who are unfamiliar with the Cuban missile crisis, here is a brief rundown. From almost the moment W.W.II ended, America and the former Soviet Union were involved in a Cold War. This resulted in a vast buildup of nuclear arms. It reached the point where the two foes could easily have destroyed all of mankind. The real danger lay in the fact that the warheads could be launched so swiftly. Each nation needed a first strike capability. This created an aura of paranoia, because the country that didn't strike first might find it had no chance to strike back. In 1962 the Russians, who had befriended Fidel Castro after he took over the Cuban government by force in 1958, decided to put nuclear missiles on that island just ninety miles off America's shores. Then President John F. Kennedy, his advisors and our military leaders found themselves in an extremely dangerous situation. They had to force the Soviets to remove the missiles, but doing so risked the possibility of nuclear war. It is unclear just how close we came, but it is possible that, if things had gone completely wrong, none of us would have lived to tell about it.The makers of Thirteen Days chose to make as their protagonist Kenney O'Donnell [Kevin Costner], who was an advisor, as well as a friend, to President Kennedy [Bruce Greenwood] and his brother, Robert [Steven Culp], the Attorney General. O'Donnell acts as our eyewitness to the events. We see the turmoil created within the White House. We watch as politicians and military leaders jockey for position. A debate rages over whether a diplomatic solution or an attack on Cuba is the best tactic. I doubt that our various generals were quite as hawkish as the movie shows them to be, but then what other solution outside of armed conflict is the military trained for? It is also doubtful that O'Donnell had such a central a role in the crisis resolution, but a movie must have some personal drama in order to hold our attention. Outside of these two dubious areas, I think the movie is remarkably faithful to history.This is Costner's best role and best movie in quite sometime, and I am thrilled to see him acting in something so good. This is the second time he has worked with director Roger Donaldson. The first time was in 1987, the year that made him a star. Ironically, the movie, No Way out, was also a political thriller involving America vs. Russia. Bruce Greenwood does a magnificent job portraying JFK. Mr. Greenwood is Canadian, and I suppose this may indicate just how difficult it was to cast the part.History buffs and people who enjoy a good thriller should love Thirteen Days. I hope they appreciate the importance and meaning of the story. There is not enough action in it to suit some viewers. Of course, if war had not been averted, they might not be here to see this or any other movie.",4,"Astute, absorbing, frightening",1016150400,"03 15, 2002",2002,3491,"['was', 'not', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'subject', 'Cuban', 'missile', 'crisis', '1962', 'event', 'was', 'easily', 'top', 'ten', 'darkest', 'moments', 'mankind', 'history', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'trivialized', 'sanitized', 'rewritten', 'simply', 'purposes', 'entertainment', 'am', 'happy', 'report', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'movie', 'true', 'story', 'least', 'insofar', 'screenplay', 'can', 'be', 'accurate', 'movie', 'forced', 'compact', 'historical', 'events', 'alter', 'degree', 'so', 'logical', 'interesting', 'story', 'can', 'unfold', 'highest', 'comment', 'can', 'pay', 'movie', 'was', 'riveted', 'knew', 'how', 'ended.For', 'who', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'Cuban', 'missile', 'crisis', 'here', 'brief', 'rundown', 'almost', 'moment', 'W.W.II', 'ended', 'America', 'former', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'were', 'involved', 'Cold', 'War', 'resulted', 'vast', 'buildup', 'nuclear', 'arms', 'reached', 'point', 'where', 'two', 'foes', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'destroyed', 'mankind', 'real', 'danger', 'lay', 'fact', 'warheads', 'could', 'be', 'launched', 'so', 'swiftly', 'nation', 'needed', 'first', 'strike', 'capability', 'created', 'aura', 'paranoia', 'country', 'did', ""n't"", 'strike', 'first', 'might', 'find', 'had', 'chance', 'strike', 'back', '1962', 'Russians', 'who', 'had', 'befriended', 'Fidel', 'Castro', 'took', 'over', 'Cuban', 'government', 'force', '1958', 'decided', 'put', 'nuclear', 'missiles', 'island', 'just', 'ninety', 'miles', 'America', 'shores', 'Then', 'President', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'advisors', 'military', 'leaders', 'found', 'extremely', 'dangerous', 'situation', 'had', 'force', 'Soviets', 'remove', 'missiles', 'doing', 'so', 'risked', 'possibility', 'nuclear', 'war', 'unclear', 'just', 'how', 'close', 'came', 'possible', 'things', 'had', 'gone', 'completely', 'wrong', 'none', 'would', 'have', 'lived', 'tell', 'it.The', 'makers', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'chose', 'make', 'protagonist', 'Kenney', ""O'Donnell"", '[', 'Kevin', 'Costner', ']', 'who', 'was', 'advisor', 'as', 'well', 'friend', 'President', 'Kennedy', '[', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', ']', 'brother', 'Robert', '[', 'Steven', 'Culp', ']', 'Attorney', 'General', ""O'Donnell"", 'eyewitness', 'events', 'see', 'turmoil', 'created', 'White', 'House', 'watch', 'politicians', 'military', 'leaders', 'jockey', 'position', 'debate', 'diplomatic', 'solution', 'attack', 'Cuba', 'best', 'tactic', 'doubt', 'various', 'generals', 'were', 'quite', 'as', 'hawkish', 'movie', 'be', 'then', 'what', 'other', 'solution', 'armed', 'conflict', 'military', 'trained', 'also', 'doubtful', ""O'Donnell"", 'had', 'central', 'role', 'crisis', 'resolution', 'movie', 'must', 'have', 'personal', 'drama', 'order', 'hold', 'attention', 'two', 'dubious', 'areas', 'think', 'movie', 'remarkably', 'faithful', 'history.This', 'Costner', 'best', 'role', 'best', 'movie', 'quite', 'sometime', 'am', 'thrilled', 'see', 'acting', 'something', 'so', 'good', 'second', 'time', 'worked', 'director', 'Roger', 'Donaldson', 'first', 'time', 'was', '1987', 'year', 'made', 'star', 'Ironically', 'movie', 'Way', 'was', 'also', 'political', 'thriller', 'involving', 'America', 'vs.', 'Russia', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'magnificent', 'job', 'portraying', 'JFK', 'Mr.', 'Greenwood', 'Canadian', 'suppose', 'may', 'indicate', 'just', 'how', 'difficult', 'was', 'cast', 'part.History', 'buffs', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'good', 'thriller', 'should', 'love', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'hope', 'appreciate', 'importance', 'meaning', 'story', 'not', 'enough', 'action', 'suit', 'viewers', 'course', 'war', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'averted', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'here', 'see', 'other', 'movie']",N/A
582649,AXQ8T2D9IT6UG,B00005J760,"M. B. Alcat ""Curiosity killed the cat, but sa...","[2, 3]","""Thirteen Days"" is an absolutely wonderful movie that somehow allows the spectator to be a witness of some of the meetings behind closed doors that took place in the White House during the Cuban Missile Crisis, in October 1962.Among the people that participated in those meetings, the most important ones were probably the president John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood), Robert F. Kennedy (Steven Culp), Defense Secretary Robert McNamara (Dylan Baker), presidential aide Kenneth O'Donnell (Kevin Costner), Adlai Stevenson (the US Ambassador to the UN, played by Michael Fairman), Secretary of State Dean Rusk (Henry Strozier), National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy (Frank Wood) and Ted Sorensen as Special Counsel to the President (Tim Kelleher).That was a moment in time when nuclear war was a very real possibility, and J.F. Kennedy did all in his power to avoid such an event. The actor that plays him said something that I consider noteworthy: ""There is something immoral about abandoning your own judgement"". I think that the director (Roger Donaldson) tried to highlight with that phrase the ultimate responsibility of the president regarding the course of action that his administration was going to take. All his advisors could give their opinion, but in the end it was J.F. Kennedy's decision that mattered.What triggered that dreadful situation, that lasted 13 days?. The URSS secretly sent ballistic missiles to Cuba, missiles capable of destroying many United States' cities, thus threatening national security. The Americans discovered that, and had to reach a decision regarding what to do. The responsibility was immense, because a simple mistake could mean the beginning of a nuclear war.All throughout the movie we can see that the president of the United States knew that the consequences if the matter got out of hand were going to be catastrophic. But what to do?. Many of his advisors had vastly different opinions, ranging from invading Cuba immediately to waiting a little for a political solution to the problem. It is really interesting to realize how difficult it was for them (and specially the president) to reach a decision, when so much was at stake, and they had incomplete information about URSS' intentions.Of course, ""Thirteen Days"" isn't entirely historically accurate, overemphasizing the role of some of the characters, and maybe not paying enough importance to others. All the same, that often happens in movies, and that doesn't mean that they aren't good. If you want a completely accurate recount of the Cuban Missile Crisis, read a history book like ""The Kennedy Tapes: Inside the White House During the Cuban Missile Crisis"". If you just want to watch a good film that will give you a fairly accurate idea of what happened then, watch this film. My recommendation?: do both things.On the whole, I think that you are highly likely to enjoy ""Thirteen Days"". You will be entertained, but at the same time you will have a glimpse of how the process of decision during crisis really works in real life, and how difficult it is to conciliate the views of different agencies. What is more, and if you don't know much about the Cuban Missile Crisis, this film might be perfect as an small introduction to the matter. Truth to be told, I had already studied this crisis at university, but I enjoyed watching Roger Donaldson's take on it  :)Belen Alcat",5,"""There is something immoral about abandoning your own judgement""",1128211200,"10 2, 2005",2005,3385,"['Thirteen', 'Days', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'somehow', 'spectator', 'be', 'witness', 'meetings', 'closed', 'doors', 'took', 'place', 'White', 'House', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'October', '1962.Among', 'people', 'participated', 'meetings', 'most', 'important', 'ones', 'were', 'probably', 'president', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'Robert', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'Steven', 'Culp', 'Defense', 'Secretary', 'Robert', 'McNamara', 'Dylan', 'Baker', 'presidential', 'aide', 'Kenneth', ""O'Donnell"", 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Adlai', 'Stevenson', 'US', 'Ambassador', 'UN', 'played', 'Michael', 'Fairman', 'Secretary', 'State', 'Dean', 'Rusk', 'Henry', 'Strozier', 'National', 'Security', 'Advisor', 'McGeorge', 'Bundy', 'Frank', 'Wood', 'Ted', 'Sorensen', 'Special', 'Counsel', 'President', 'Tim', 'Kelleher', 'was', 'moment', 'time', 'when', 'nuclear', 'war', 'was', 'very', 'real', 'possibility', 'J.F', 'Kennedy', 'did', 'power', 'avoid', 'such', 'event', 'actor', 'said', 'something', 'consider', 'noteworthy', 'something', 'immoral', 'abandoning', 'own', 'judgement', 'think', 'director', 'Roger', 'Donaldson', 'tried', 'highlight', 'ultimate', 'responsibility', 'president', 'regarding', 'course', 'action', 'administration', 'was', 'going', 'take', 'advisors', 'could', 'give', 'opinion', 'end', 'was', 'J.F', 'Kennedy', 'decision', 'mattered.What', 'triggered', 'dreadful', 'situation', 'lasted', '13', 'days', 'URSS', 'secretly', 'sent', 'ballistic', 'missiles', 'Cuba', 'capable', 'destroying', 'many', 'United', 'States', 'cities', 'thus', 'threatening', 'national', 'security', 'Americans', 'discovered', 'had', 'reach', 'decision', 'regarding', 'what', 'do', 'responsibility', 'was', 'immense', 'simple', 'mistake', 'could', 'mean', 'beginning', 'nuclear', 'war.All', 'movie', 'can', 'see', 'president', 'United', 'States', 'knew', 'consequences', 'matter', 'got', 'hand', 'were', 'going', 'be', 'catastrophic', 'what', 'do', 'Many', 'advisors', 'had', 'vastly', 'different', 'opinions', 'ranging', 'invading', 'Cuba', 'immediately', 'waiting', 'little', 'political', 'solution', 'problem', 'really', 'interesting', 'realize', 'how', 'difficult', 'was', 'specially', 'president', 'reach', 'decision', 'when', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'stake', 'had', 'incomplete', 'information', 'URSS', 'intentions.Of', 'course', 'Thirteen', 'Days', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'historically', 'accurate', 'overemphasizing', 'role', 'characters', 'maybe', 'not', 'paying', 'enough', 'importance', 'others', 'same', 'often', 'movies', ""n't"", 'mean', 'are', ""n't"", 'good', 'want', 'completely', 'accurate', 'recount', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'read', 'history', 'book', 'Kennedy', 'Tapes', 'White', 'House', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'just', 'want', 'watch', 'good', 'film', 'will', 'give', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'idea', 'what', 'happened', 'then', 'watch', 'film', 'recommendation', 'do', 'things.On', 'whole', 'think', 'are', 'highly', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'will', 'be', 'entertained', 'same', 'time', 'will', 'have', 'glimpse', 'how', 'process', 'decision', 'crisis', 'really', 'real', 'life', 'how', 'difficult', 'conciliate', 'views', 'different', 'agencies', 'What', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'perfect', 'small', 'introduction', 'matter', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'had', 'already', 'studied', 'crisis', 'university', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Roger', 'Donaldson', 'take', 'Belen', 'Alcat']",N/A

582651,A3IB1W0SVED0Z3,B00005J760,"Mike Powers ""mkp51""","[9, 14]","Thirteen days. Thirteen days in October 1962 when the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics stood &quot;eyeball-to-eyeball&quot; in a confrontation that brought the world to the very edge of nuclear war.The &quot;Cuban Missile Crisis,&quot; as history has dubbed this autumnal fortnight, was perhaps the closest humanity has ever come to nuclear annihilation.  In the year 2000 - thirty-eight years after humanity's &quot;near death experience&quot; - came a movie that attempts to re-create the tension and fear of the Cuban Missile Crisis. &quot;Thirteen Days,&quot; starring Kevin Costner, Bruce Greenwood, Steven Culp, and Dylan Baker, is a well acted, directed, written historical drama that largely succeeds in bringing to life one of the great political crises of the twentieth century.&quot;Thirteen Days&quot; is a very well written film that largely succeeds in conveying the sense of urgency and palpable tension that existed within the Kennedy administration during these dark days. The film certainly has an air of historical authenticity about it. Screen writer David Self based much of his material on a book entitled &quot;The Kennedy Tapes: Inside the White House During the Cuban Missile Crisis,&quot;  by Ernest R. May and Philip D. Zelikow. This book contains transcripts of secretly taped conversations that occurred inside the Oval Office and Cabinet Room during the Cuban Missile Crisis. It's clearly apparent that many of the scenes in &quot;Thirteen Days&quot; are faithful reproductions of those taped conversations.Most of the historical events shown in the film - the discovery of the missiles; the decision to impose a naval blockade; the intense efforts to reach a diplomatic solution to the crisis are well documented in history. So, it's safe to say that &quot;Thirteen Days&quot; is a reasonably faithful distillation of what actually happened during the Cuban Missile Crisis.The film may be historically accurate, but how historically objective is it?  How well do the filmmakers resist the temptation to put a particular political &quot;spin&quot; on the events depicted in &quot;Thirteen Days?&quot; Here, I think, the film does not fare quite so well.It's hampered at the outset by virtue of the fact that the entire story is seen through the eyes of President Kennedy's closest political advisor and friend, Kenny O'Donnell (played by Kevin Costner). It's well known that O'Donnell, who died in 1977, practically &quot;hero-worshipped&quot; Kennedy, so it's doubtful that anything he left behind, in the form of speeches, memoirs, or other communications, would have been particularly objective in nature.There's no mistaking the filmmakers' attempt to paint the nation's senior military leadership as nothing but a bunch of conniving warmongers, however. Generals Taylor and LeMay, and Admiral Anderson, are all painted as virulent opponents of President Kennedy, and conspirators in an overt plot to start a war they desperately want. From what I've read of history, the senior military leaders during the Kennedy administration were extremely competent and always acted in a highly professional manner. So, the film's subtle efforts to portray all military people as connivers and conspirators are inexcusable.The film's portrayal of John and Robert Kennedy is more sympathetic... and, oddly, more balanced. We see the Kennedys' strengths and weaknesses in equal measure. President Kennedy is seen as a man genuinely desirous of peace, desperately searching for a way to avoid Armageddon. Yet, confronted with a series of life-and-death decisions, he seems at times almost paralyzed by indecisiveness. Robert Kennedy, Attorney General of the United States, comes off as idealistic, loyal, smart, competent... and at the same time ruthless, and willing to compromise his ethics for political advantage.The acting is, for the most part, pretty good. Bruce Greenwood and Steven Culp give masterful portrayals of  the brothers John and Robert Kennedy respectively. Dylan Baker is excellent as the precise, almost robotic Defense Secretary Robert McNamara; as are Michael Fairman as Adlai Stevenson; Kevin Conway as General Curtis (&quot;bomb `em back to the Stone Age&quot;) LeMay; and Bill Smitrovich as General Maxwell Taylor.Kevin Costner's performance as Kenny O'Donnell is the one major disappointment in this film. His acting problems begin with an absolutely ludicrous Boston &quot;accent,&quot; but they don't end there. He imbues his character with the same stiffness, colorlessness, and lifelessness that's typical of all his work. He consistently sounds like he's reading or reciting his lines, not speaking them naturally.Despite Costner's poor performance and some questions concerning the film's historical objectivity, &quot;Thirteen Days&quot; remains a very good film. It successfully captures the tension and fear that pervaded not only the government, but society as a whole. It opens a window on the tough decision-making required from men untested in the crucible of history. And, it's just plain good old fashioned entertainment to boot.",4,Thirteen Days of tension and fear...,1004313600,"10 29, 2001",2001,5127,"['Thirteen', 'days', 'Thirteen', 'days', 'October', '1962',

582652,A2RCXHM9298L75,B00005J760,Mike Wells,"[3, 6]","It is October 1962, and US intelligence have discovered that the Soviet Union is placing nuclear weapons in Cuba, within striking distance of Northern America, and with the capability of wiping out much of the area within minutes. President Kennedy and his advisers are faced with the daunting prospect of responding firmly but responsibly. In the thirteen days of the crisis, the need to first and foremost, defend America from the threat of extinction by invading Cuba, is weighed up against the possiblity that an invasion of Cuba will lead to Russian retaliation in eastern Europe. It seems that whichever way he goes, Kennedy will be staring at some sort of world war.The film takes painstaking effort to portray this background accurately, and does a remarkably good job. The acting of Bruce Greenwood as the President, and the much-maligned Kevin Costner as his adviser Kenny O'Donnell is excellent, while Steven Culp as Bobby Kennedy is exceptional. Some might say, ""Steven who?"", but that is the point. Many of the people who played out this drama in real-life are faceless nameless figures who 99.9% of the US population would never have heard of. A cast of unknowns is therefore appropriate, and besides, the acting from all the cast is very very good. Overall, the two commendable features of the film are that a). It never trivialises the seriousness of the real-life situation, and doesn't pander to Hollywood; and b). It isn't afraid to have long scenes of hefty but highly fascinating and invigorating dialogue. It uses music and dramatic effect, but never at the expense of the dialogue.Obviously, this film will not be everyone's cup of tea.

Carnegie,"[12, 14]","This is an excellent and unfairly overlooked movie that should have at least generated Oscar nominations, if not Oscars, twelve months ago. Unfairly criticised for fictionally enhancing the White House role of presidential aide Kenneth O'Donnell and taking liberties with the facts, this is the kind of Costner bashing that its star and co-producer must be pretty familiar with by now.Centring around the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962, this is an excellent movie that gives many of us too young to remember an insight into the terrifying events that all so nearly led to WWIII and mutually assured nuclear destruction by the superpowers, of the world as we know it. Criticised for exaggerating the role of white house aid Kenny O'Donnell, you have to question whether or not their would have been the same fuss if it were not for the fact that the aforementioned white house aid was played by Kevin Costner. It always bemuses and frustrates me that the critics are very selective in their criticisms of movies and their historical inaccuracies. How come movies such as the cringeworthy Titanic and Braveheart can take such enormous liberties with the truth and win so many Oscars without barely a whisper of criticism and yet Denzel Washington can be deprived of an Oscar for 'Hurricane' because of an unsubstantiated whispering campaign about its historical accuracy? Wouldn't it be much preferable if we lived in a world without such petty jealousies and vendettas, where credit was given where credit was due? In Thirteen Days the character of Kenny O'Donnell is central to the telling of the story and that aside, the depiction of the historical events are beyond reproach.Director Roger Donaldson should be congratulated (and should have been Oscar nominated) for successfully serving up a genuine edge of your seat historical political pot-boiler of a movie. Even though I know that we didn't go to war in 1962 and that it was all resolved amicably in the end (well, nearly), I was still riveted and anxious throughout the whole movie. I almost had my fingers crossed, praying that everything worked out, even though I knew it did. Now that's great film-making and quite an achievement to exact that effect. Kudos also for Bruce Greenwood and Steven Culp for their understated performances as JFK and Bobby and for Kevin Costner for avoiding the showy role (of JFK) and returning to form. Costner also deserves praise just for bringing this personal project of a movie and history lesson to our screens, as does David Self for the excellent screenplay. Thirteen Days is the type of thought-provoking and intense movie we could with seeing Hollywood make more often.What is more, if you buy the Infinifilm edition, you can enjoy watching it again and again and (with infinifilm enabled) in the process learn more about the historically crucial thirteen days in October 1962 when the world stood still.

It may not be as in-depth as a book devoted to the subject but it whets the appetite of those who would not otherwise have cared. Those reviewers, who argue that the movie overemphasized O'Donnell's role, should remember that this is a movie and not a documentary and as such the director has the right to choose to highlight the role of some of the characters if he feels this would make the film more interesting.What was particularly interesting for me as I watched this film was the fact that this would be a gold mine for a game theorist, and I'm pretty sure there have been books or articles examining this issue using game theory.. It is also interesting as a study of decision making under great uncertainty, and one cannot help but admire J.F.K's cool head and desire to be as certain as possible before making a decision. Comparisons could probably be drawn between the hawkish `men-of-war' back in Kennedy's day and the current kettle of hawks in the white house today.But politics aside, this movie should be watched for its own sake, because it really is a thriller and it does keep you on the edge of your seat throughout its duration. I was certainly spellbound throughout and I came out of it learning something and desiring to know more. I don't think any rational person gets their whole history from a movie, so don't expect this to answer all your questions about the Cuban missile crisis.The extras on the DVD are excellent; there are interviews with Khrushchev's son, Sergei as well as with professors from Havard and the Brookings Institute which examine the origins of the missile crisis. There are also short film-clips about the main players in the film, McNamara, J.FK, O'Donell etc... even some prominent journalists are included.I highly recommend this movie, not because I am a fan of J.F.K (I'm not) but because it is a great film in its own right and also as an introduction to the events of 1962.",5,&quot;Edge of your seat&quot; history.,1083715200,"05 5, 2004",2004,2211,"['Credit', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'Roger', 'Donaldson', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'bringing', 'suspense', 'tension', 'Cuban', 'missile', 'crisis', 'silver', 'screen', 'Thirteen', 'days', 'excellent', 'introduction', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'cold', 'war', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'around', '60s', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'in-depth', 'book', 'devoted', 'subject', 'appetite', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'otherwise', 'have', 'cared', 'reviewers', 'who', 'argue', 'movie', 'overemphasized', ""O'Donnell"", 'role', 'should', 'remember', 'movie', 'not', 'documentary', 'such', 'director', 'right', 'choose', 'highlight', 'role', 'characters', 'would', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'was', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'watched', 'film', 'was', 'fact', 'would', 'be', 'gold', 'mine', 'game', 'theorist', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'have', 'been', 'books', 'articles', 'examining', 'issue', 'using', 'game', 'theory..', 'also', 'interesting', 'study', 'decision', 'making', 'great', 'uncertainty', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'admire', 'J.F.K', 'cool', 'head', 'desire', 'be', 'as', 'certain', 'possible', 'making', 'decision', 'Comparisons', 'could', 'probably', 'be', 'drawn', 'hawkish', 'men-of-war', 'back', 'Kennedy', 'day', 'current', 'kettle', 'hawks', 'white', 'house', 'today.But', 'politics', 'aside', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'own', 'sake', 'really', 'thriller', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'duration', 'was', 'certainly', 'spellbound', 'came', 'learning', 'something', 'desiring', 'know', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'rational', 'person', 'whole', 'history', 'movie', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'answer', 'questions', 'Cuban', 'missile', 'crisis.The', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'excellent', 'are', 'interviews', 'Khrushchev', 'son', 'Sergei', 'as', 'well', 'professors', 'Havard', 'Brookings', 'Institute', 'examine', 'origins', 'missile', 'crisis', 'are', 'also', 'short', 'film-clips', 'main', 'players', 'film', 'McNamara', 'J.FK', ""O'Donell"", 'etc', 'even', 'prominent', 'journalists', 'are', 'included.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'not', 'am', 'fan', 'J.F.K', ""'m"", 'not', 'great', 'film', 'own', 'right', 'also', 'introduction', 'events', '1962']",N/A

Now, I wasn't around in '62, but it seems quite accurate from my point of view.  In fact, the biggest 'mess-up' I could pick out was a quick glimpse of a C-130 Hercules (cargo plane) taxiing, wearing the current USAF paint scheme and not the 1960's SEA (Southeast Asia) camouflage or old Military Airlift Command colors!  The computer-generated aircraft scenes did a little to detract from the realism, but there are no RF-8s, U-2Cs, or F-101s still flying, so at least the producers took the time to make the aircraft accurate.  I did like the Vietnam-era carrier footage and the aircraft scrambles, however!  Those were the real thing!  By the way, if you haven't noticed, I'm quite the aviation nut.  The cast line-up was pretty impressive: Kevin Costner as special assistant to the president Kenny O'Donnell, Bruce Greenwood as JFK, Steven Culp (best known for his role as Clayton Webb on ""J.A.G."") as Bobby Kennedy, Bill Smitrovich as Gen.

Sometimes this is very difficult for the viewer that is versed in history and can impact on the quality of the film, however credit should also be given to the fact that cinema is an art form and poetic license is part of the package of creativity.This film is biased. There is no doubt there. The players in this film are fleshed out fully, but the darker side of their reign is never presented. Like most other reviewers have mentioned, the Bay of Pigs is hardly dealt with, nor is the fact that most of the US administration on display here actually tried to assassinate Castro. So really the film starts with a clean slate as if the previous events never happened and makes everyone seem guiltless, innocent and blameless from the word go when in truth they where already knee-deep in a political cold war with ample amounts of subversive behavior to boot.The film is basically about the standoff between the US administration and the USSR administration over the Soviets setting up warheads in Cuba right on the American shoreline. The film's suspense and tension is second to none for its type. This is a great political drama and the acting is on top form. It is very brainy and you must pay lots of attention to the convoluted dialogue to get what is going on. It's all good and more intelligent movies like this one should be made.All historical inaccuracies aside, this is a great family value movie that is well worth watching. There are several scenes in this film that really do have you chewing on your nails. It is enjoyable, well produced, well acted and well directed. This is the kind of film that you hope to see again and the quicker the better. However it is biased, does not cover both sides equally and does promote the American side quite a bit. So in the end this is not a bad starting point to learn more about the subject - just make sure that you do not leave it at that.

That's it. That's all. No big deal but nothing to be ashamed of, either. However, according to critic Roger Ebert, it just so happens that ""O'Donnell's son Kevin, the Earthlink millionaire, is an investor in the company of ""Thirteen Days"" producer Armyan Bernstein"". Well, reading between the lines, I can't think of a worst way to honor someone's dad than to ignore his actual deeds by making him the larger-than-life figure he never was.For if one is to believe this movie, Kenneth O'Donnell was ""the fifth Kennedy""! This guy ran the White House all by himself or so it seems, because his role includes everything, from serving coffee when needed, to ammending Jackie's guest list, protecting a dovish JFK from the big bad top brass, reprimending the National Security Advisor, instructing Adlai Stevenson (no less!) on how to answer the Russians, and, mostly, telling everyone else how to do their jobs right in order to enter History (with a big H). He's always there to dispense the brothers with some pep talk, infallible advice and obsequious flattery. In the movie's worst scene, for instance, while RFK and ambassador Dobrynin hold a crucial meeting, he's on the next room whistling ""O Danny Boy"" to remind the Attorney General how much he believes in him. One wonders why Bobby never yells him to shut up, or why President Kennedy never made him Chief of Staff!Alas, poor Mr. O'Donnell! Thanks to this movie we'll never know who he really was ...That aside, the movie is a good historical thriller.

Yet I felt dissatisfied with the effort.  I feel like it was more of a Kennedy's vs The Department of Defense than the US vs USSR.  The senior uniformed leaders are depicted as a group of neanderthals out to start World War III.  According to the film, it was only by the constant pressure of the Kennedy's and MacNamara that this event did not come to pass.  The dispute between MacNamara and the Chief of Naval Operations is a prime example of civilian oversight that seems be a little bit overzealous.This did bring back memories of the event for me.  I remember sitting in the living room watching Stevenson and Zoran going at each other in the court of world opinion.  I also remember watching from my classroom in Groton Connecticut as all the submarines that could sail, left the submarine base and headed out to sea.  It certainly brought the issue home to me.  Also during that period my father, on the submarine force staff, would come home for a few hours of sleep and head back to the office.  I never really saw him for that entire period.  I would only know he'd been home by the cigarette buts in a previously empty ash tray.This is a tolerable film if one views it as only one interpretation of what happened during those days.

Kennedy and Steven Culp (best known for his recurring role as CIA agent Clayton Webb on JAG) gets to sink his teeth into a passionate Bobby Kennedy.  Costner plays Kenny O'Donnell, a powerful but behind the scenes player who was probably not well known prior to this movie.Neither Greenwood or Webb looks like or is made-up to look like Jack or Bobby and that's a good thing.  The rest of the supporting cast mostly resembles the characters they play.

Kevin Conway swaggers in as General Curtis &quot;bomb 'em back to the stone age&quot; Lemay in a wonderful portrayal of the powerful Air Force general.This is one film where you may want to view the extensive biographical material on each character before you actually see the film, especially if you are unfamiliar with the people I have mentioned above.

582669,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005J760,Reviewer,"[35, 37]","Throughout the Twentieth Century, misjudgment-- the failure of one side to extrapolate the position of the other side-- has resulted in every major war from WWI to the Korean conflict.  And no one was more aware of this than President John F. Kennedy, when in October of 1962, photographs taken by an American U-2 spy plane uncovered the existence of Russian surface-to-surface missiles being deployed in Cuba; missiles with a range that encompassed every major city in the U.S., with the exception of Seattle.  ""Thirteen Days,"" directed by Roger Donaldson, is a chronicle of two of the most intense, significant weeks in the history of America, as well as U.S./Soviet relations.  Thirteen days that came down to a twelve to twenty-four hour period that could have changed the world as we know it today.Working from an intelligent, well-researched and accurate screenplay by David Self, Donaldson takes you behind the closed doors of the White House and conference rooms in which the fate of the nation was ultimately decided.  The outcome is, of course, a matter of history, but the process which led to the final conclusion is intense, riveting drama that in the end illuminates just how close the world was brought to the brink of nuclear war by the Cuban Missile Crisis.Much of the tension in the film is derived and enhanced by the fact that it only gives the perspective of the Americans; but rather than making it a stilted, biased account, however, it becomes an objective, thoroughly engrossing presentation, and the fact that the viewer knows only what Kennedy knew puts you in the room with him, so to speak, and allows you to experience the process of assimilating the information, of extrapolating with Kennedy and ultimately making one of the most monumental decisions in history.The story unfolds through the eyes of Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner), special advisor to the President, long time friend of the family and a trusted member of the Kennedy inner-circle.  The film accurately establishes O'Donnell's position without embellishing his role simply for dramatic effect; he serves as something of a ""tour guide,"" through whom you gain access to the drama playing out behind the curtain.  That he is a close friend of the Kennedys is reflected in many scenes in which O'Donnell, Jack and Bobby are alone together.  And since the story is told from O'Donnell's point-of-view, naturally his is a significant role; the film very subtly goes to great lengths, however, to establish the fact that within the conference rooms or during the meetings in the Oval Office, O'Donnell is kept at arm's length and, though present, is not a direct participant.Costner gives what is arguably one of the best performances of his career in this film, successfully capturing the essence of O'Donnell in an understated, subtle way that works extremely well and serves the story effectively.  He's clearly the star of the picture, though much of what he does is on the sidelines, which keeps the focus on Kennedy and the magnitude of the situation at hand.  Costner has drawn criticism in some quarters with regards to the distinctive New England accent he affects in the film, but the criticism is unwarranted; you have only to hear a tape of the real O'Donnell to realize how accurate Costner's portrayal is, up to and including the accent.Donaldson and the producers of this film realized that for it to really have an impact, the roles of JFK and RFK, especially, had to be cast with great care; for the film to be believable and to maintain that focus on the story, the Kennedys had to be believable, otherwise the effect would be significant to the point of distraction.  And their meticulous efforts and hard work paid off.  Bruce Greenwood gives an excellent performance as John Kennedy, from the accent to the body language and mannerisms he affects that so defined him.  And Steven Culp is perfect as Bobby, imbuing his performance with nuance and an eye for detail that convincingly brings him to life.The outstanding supporting cast includes Dylan Baker (McNamara), Henry Strozier (Rusk), Frank Wood (Bundy), Len Cariou (Acheson), Bill Smitrovich (General Taylor), Kevin Conway (General LeMay) and Kelly Connell (Salinger).  During the strife of the Civil War, the nation was preserved because the right man, Abraham Lincoln, was in the right place at the right time; and in retrospect, the same can be said of John F. Kennedy and the Cuban Missile Crisis.  As Kennedy said, if we fail to comprehend the Soviets, and they don't understand us, the result will be tragic; and though the controversy of politics is inescapable, and there will always be two sides with opposing views, this film succinctly demonstrates that in this instance, it all came down to the decision of one man who proved he had the vision and the determination to do the right thing.  And anyone who disputes it need only be reminded that, in fact, that is the Sun you see shining through your own window every morning.",5,Riveting Drama That Brings History To Life,995155200,"07 15, 2001",2001,5003,"['Twentieth', 'Century', 'misjudgment', 'failure', 'one', 'side', 'extrapolate', 'position', 'other', 'side', 'resulted', 'major', 'war', 'WWI', 'Korean', 'conflict', 'one', 'was', 'more', 'aware', 'President', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'when', 'October', '1962', 'photographs', 'taken', 'American', 'U-2', 'spy', 'plane', 'uncovered', 'existence', 'Russian', 'surface-to-surface', 'missiles', 'being', 'deployed', 'Cuba', 'missiles', 'range', 'encompassed', 'major', 'city', 'U.S.', 'exception', 'Seattle', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'directed', 'Roger', 'Donaldson', 'chronicle', 'two', 'most', 'intense', 'significant', 'weeks', 'history', 'America', 'as', 'well', 'U.S./Soviet', 'relations', 'Thirteen', 'days', 'came', 'down', 'twelve', 'twenty-four', 'hour', 'period', 'could', 'have', 'changed', 'world', 'know', 'today.Working', 'intelligent', 'well-researched', 'accurate', 'screenplay', 'David', 'Self', 'Donaldson', 'closed', 'doors', 'White', 'House', 'conference', 'rooms', 'fate', 'nation', 'was', 'ultimately', 'decided', 'outcome', 'course', 'matter', 'history', 'process', 'led', 'final', 'conclusion', 'intense', 'riveting', 'drama', 'end', 'just', 'how', 'close', 'world', 'was', 'brought', 'brink', 'nuclear', 'war', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis.Much', 'tension', 'film', 'derived', 'enhanced', 'fact', 'only', 'perspective', 'Americans', 'rather', 'making', 'stilted', 'biased', 'account', 'however', 'objective', 'thoroughly', 'engrossing', 'presentation', 'fact', 'viewer', 'only', 'what', 'Kennedy', 'knew', 'puts', 'room', 'so', 'speak', 'experience', 'process', 'assimilating', 'information', 'extrapolating', 'Kennedy', 'ultimately', 'making', 'one', 'most', 'monumental', 'decisions', 'history.The', 'story', 'unfolds', 'eyes', 'Kenny', ""O'Donnell"", 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'special', 'advisor', 'President', 'long', 'time', 'friend', 'family', 'trusted', 'member', 'Kennedy', 'inner-circle', 'film', 'accurately', ""O'Donnell"", 'position', 'embellishing', 'role', 'simply', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'something', 'tour', 'guide', 'whom', 'gain', 'access', 'drama', 'playing', 'out', 'curtain', 'close', 'friend', 'Kennedys', 'reflected', 'many', 'scenes', ""O'Donnell"", 'Jack', 'Bobby', 'are', 'alone', 'together', 'story', 'told', ""O'Donnell"", 'point-of-view', 'naturally', 'significant', 'role', 'film', 'very', 'subtly', 'great', 'lengths', 'however', 'establish', 'fact', 'conference', 'rooms', 'meetings', 'Oval', 'Office', ""O'Donnell"", 'kept', 'arm', 'length', 'though', 'present', 'not', 'direct', 'participant.Costner', 'what', 'arguably', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'career', 'film', 'successfully', 'capturing', 'essence', ""O'Donnell"", 'understated', 'subtle', 'way', 'extremely', 'well', 'story', 'effectively', 'clearly', 'star', 'picture', 'though', 'much', 'what', 'sidelines', 'focus', 'Kennedy', 'magnitude', 'situation', 'hand', 'Costner', 'drawn', 'criticism', 'quarters', 'regards', 'distinctive', 'New', 'England', 'accent', 'film', 'criticism', 'unwarranted', 'have', 'only', 'hear', 'tape', 'real', ""O'Donnell"", 'realize', 'how', 'accurate', 'Costner', 'portrayal', 'up', 'including', 'accent.Donaldson', 'producers', 'film', 'realized', 'really', 'have', 'impact', 'roles', 'JFK', 'RFK', 'especially', 'had', 'be', 'cast', 'great', 'care', 'film', 'be', 'believable', 'maintain', 'focus', 'story', 'Kennedys', 'had', 'be', 'believable', 'otherwise', 'effect', 'would', 'be', 'significant', 'point', 'distraction', 'meticulous', 'efforts', 'hard', 'work', 'paid', 'off', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'excellent', 'performance', 'John', 'Kennedy', 'accent', 'body', 'language', 'mannerisms', 'so', 'defined', 'Steven', 'Culp', 'perfect', 'Bobby', 'imbuing', 'performance', 'nuance', 'eye', 'detail', 'convincingly', 'life.The', 'outstanding', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Dylan', 'Baker', 'McNamara', 'Henry', 'Strozier', 'Rusk', 'Frank', 'Wood', 'Bundy', 'Len', 'Cariou', 'Acheson', 'Bill', 'Smitrovich', 'General', 'Taylor', 'Kevin', 'Conway', 'General', 'LeMay', 'Kelly', 'Connell', 'Salinger', 'strife', 'Civil', 'War', 'nation', 'was', 'preserved', 'right', 'man', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'right', 'place', 'right', 'time', 'retrospect', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'Kennedy', 'said', 'fail', 'comprehend', 'Soviets', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'result', 'will', 'be', 'tragic', 'controversy', 'politics', 'inescapable', 'there', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'two', 'sides', 'opposing', 'views', 'film', 'succinctly', 'instance', 'came', 'down', 'decision', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'proved', 'had', 'vision', 'determination', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'anyone', 'who', 'need', 'only', 'be', 'reminded', 'fact', 'Sun', 'see', 'shining', 'own', 'window', 'morning']",N/A

I have a read a bit about it--the idea that this really happened I find astounding--and what strikes me as so remarkable is the human element that each player showed. From Kennedy to Khrushchev to the Russians in the submarines to the Cubans working at the missile site, when faced with the brink of nuclear war all the squabbling, plotting, hierarchies, and other destructive social norms were pushed aside to allow for a sensible resolution. When faced with nuclear war humanity and 'good will' (as the movie puts it) won out--albeit barely.This movie is an exhilarating ride painting a pretty fair account of both sides. There are some dramatic liberties takes (as other reviewers point out) but it is a movie and this (if you can overlook it) is quite acceptable.I enjoy seeing Khrushchev portrayed as a human being with doubts, worries about respect, ranking and saving face. Hollywood has a bad habit of giving us the classic good versus evil routine (even after Austin Powers ridiculed it in three successful movies) but this is a more rational look at both sides.

Unfortunately there's little dramatic tension because, excuse me, but we already know the world didn't blow up.  The first half of the long movie is made up of increasingly angry, white-guy talking heads.  Some of it is shot in black and white just to emphasize how serious and real this all is.  Kostner is JFK advisor Kenny O'Donnell.  The last half is the nicely visualized showdown.  Roger Donaldson directs this big screen version of what is basically a TV movie.  In fact, the subject was once a TV movie.  A host of extras include background documentary on the historical incident and detailed audio commentary with Donaldson and Costner -- the latter's comments sound like they're literally phoned in and heard on a speaker phone.

582673,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,B00005J760,Roger J. Buffington,"[1, 1]","This is an excellent Cold War drama depicting the Cuban Missile Crisis.  The storyline is brisk and interesting.  The movie holds your interest all the way through in a way that's becoming rare these days with some of Hollywood's (and all of Europe's) overlong movies.This is the Cuban Missile Crises from the perspective of Kevin O'Donnell, Special Assistant to President Kennedy.  This fact is the biggest flaw in the movie.  O'Donnell was essentially Kennedy's appointment's secretary and political advisor, which is not a trivial role.  However, it is almost impossible not to conclude after viewing this film that O'Donnell's role is very much inflated.  This little fact is given away by the fact that Kevin Costner plays O'Donnell.  O'Donnell is the one (if you can believe the movie) who figures out that the &quot;back channel&quot; contact from the KGB is directly from Khruschev.  Golly, what was the CIA doing through all this?  Nope, it took Kevin Costner to deduce this.  Not only is he Kennedy's right hand man and political advisor, but he is the only competent intelligence analyst we have too?  Come on.The other flaw in the movie is the &quot;Barbra Streisand&quot; view of the military that it takes.  This film portrays all of JFK's Joint Chiefs of Staff as slavering warmongers.  Hollywood just couldn't restrain itself from trashing the military in a way that is neither subtle, believable, or in good taste.  Well, doubtless Julia Roberts, Barbra, and the rest will be pleased.  I was not.Were it not for the inflation of O'Donnell/Costner's role (which wasn't believable) and the caricatures of the military men, this movie would have rated 5 stars.  Other than these flaws it is a believable, well-acted, fast-paced, and well-directed depiction of a pivotal moment of the Cold War.  Recommended despite the flaws.The DVD is superb.  Lots of nice extras.  The sound and video are first-rate.

582674,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005J760,Roland E. Zwick,"[6, 7]","In just the past few months - since the United States has once again been put on a state of high alert after the September 11th terrorist attacks - ""Thirteen Days"" has assumed a position of much greater pertinence than it did when it was first released in theatres in late 2000.  What at that time might have seemed like little more than a quaint history lesson - dealing with issues and events from a bygone world and era - now suddenly throbs with a contemporary relevance it didn't have before.""Thirteen Days"" derives its title from the two-week period in October 1962 when, during the famed Cuban Missile Crisis, the world was brought almost to the brink of nuclear annihilation.  In this Halloween horror to end all Halloween horrors, the citizens of the planet held their collective breaths as President Kennedy and Premier Khrushchev faced off over the Soviets' attempt to employ nuclear weapons, aimed directly at the United States, in Castro's Cuba.The most admirable aspect of ""Thirteen Days"" is that the filmmakers understand the power of their material and feel no need to hype or gussy it up with irrelevant side issues or cheap melodramatics.  For 147 minutes, we are thrust into the center of this volatile moment in time as President Kennedy, his Attorney General (and brother) Robert Kennedy, and Special Assistant to the President Kenneth P. O'Donnell - who serves as the Everyman focal point for the audience - weigh what options they have in trying to avoid the hitherto unthinkable possibility of global, all-out nuclear war. Complicating their decisions are many of the contending forces in their own ranks - be it Congress, the Joint Chiefs of Staff or the media - all of which have a particular point to make, job to do, or political ax to grind.  The film is fascinating just on the level of allowing us to see the complex and often ugly nuts-and-bolts aspect of high governmental drama.  Yet, although the film never wavers from the issue at hand, it manages to achieve remarkable depth of character as we see these three men of goodwill struggling with an issue of unprecedented life-or-death global importance.  We come to see the toll such stress brings to bear even on men who, in our tendency to romanticize our heroes, often seem superhuman from our outside-looking-in perspective.Despite the fact that the movie rarely leaves its Washington setting, we are still afforded chilling images of life on the outside during these two amazing weeks:  anchorman Walter Cronkite intoning a bleak sign-off to his broadcast during one of the gloomiest hours of the crisis, hordes of somber Catholics queuing up outside a church where round-the-clock confessions have been instituted, and masses of people depleting grocery store shelves in preparation for the worst-possible-case scenario.Kevin Kostner as O'Donnell, Bruce Greenwood as JFK and Steven Culp as RFK all deliver superlative portraits of serious minded and compassionate adults who comprehend the gravity of the situation in which they find themselves.What is most amazing about ""Thirteen Hours"" is that, even though we already know how it is going to end, we still find ourselves caught up in the suspenseful nature of the situation.  Particularly gripping is the scene in which Adlai Stevenson, then U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., confronts head-on the Soviet ambassador who attempts to deny the truth of the allegations made against his country.  It is a moment of high political and emotional conflict worthy of Greek or Shakespearean drama.One wishes that the makers of ""Pearl Harbor"" had taken the same approach to their historical event as the makers of ""Thirteen Days"" did to theirs.  Then we might have been spared the inane, puppy-love scenario that all but sank that later film.  Imagine if the focus in ""Thirteen Days"" had been on John having to break the news to Marilyn while a jealous, rheumy-eyed Bobby looked on from the wings.  Thank God saner heads prevailed and we have a film on this subject that serves both as a fascinating lesson in history AND as a gripping study of human behavior in a time of crisis.  Given what the world is going through right now, ""Thirteen Days"" emerges as a film deeply relevant to our time.",4,gripping historical drama,1010188800,"01 5, 2002",2002,4222,"['just', 'past', 'few', 'months', 'United', 'States', 'once', 'again', 'been', 'put', 'state', 'high', 'alert', 'September', '11th', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'assumed', 'position', 'much', 'greater', 'pertinence', 'did', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'theatres', 'late', '2000', 'What', 'time', 'might', 'have', 'seemed', 'little', 'more', 'quaint', 'history', 'lesson', 'dealing', 'issues', 'events', 'bygone', 'world', 'era', 'now', 'suddenly', 'contemporary', 'relevance', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'before', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'title', 'two-week', 'period', 'October', '1962', 'when', 'famed', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'world', 'was', 'brought', 'almost', 'brink', 'nuclear', 'annihilation', 'Halloween', 'horror', 'end', 'Halloween', 'horrors', 'citizens', 'planet', 'held', 'collective', 'breaths', 'President', 'Kennedy', 'Premier', 'Khrushchev', 'faced', 'off', 'Soviets', 'attempt', 'employ', 'nuclear', 'weapons', 'aimed', 'directly', 'United', 'States', 'Castro', 'Cuba.The', 'most', 'admirable', 'aspect', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'filmmakers', 'understand', 'power', 'material', 'feel', 'need', 'hype', 'gussy', 'up', 'irrelevant', 'side', 'issues', 'cheap', 'melodramatics', '147', 'minutes', 'are', 'thrust', 'center', 'volatile', 'moment', 'time', 'President', 'Kennedy', 'Attorney', 'General', 'brother', 'Robert', 'Kennedy', 'Special', 'Assistant', 'President', 'Kenneth', 'P.', ""O'Donnell"", 'who', 'Everyman', 'focal', 'point', 'audience', 'weigh', 'what', 'options', 'have', 'trying', 'avoid', 'hitherto', 'unthinkable', 'possibility', 'global', 'all-out', 'nuclear', 'war', 'Complicating', 'decisions', 'are', 'many', 'contending', 'forces', 'own', 'ranks', 'be', 'Congress', 'Joint', 'Chiefs', 'Staff', 'media', 'have', 'particular', 'point', 'make', 'job', 'do', 'political', 'ax', 'grind', 'film', 'fascinating', 'just', 'level', 'allowing', 'see', 'complex', 'often', 'ugly', 'nuts-and-bolts', 'aspect', 'high', 'governmental', 'drama', 'film', 'never', 'wavers', 'issue', 'hand', 'achieve', 'remarkable', 'depth', 'character', 'see', 'three', 'men', 'goodwill', 'struggling', 'issue', 'unprecedented', 'life-or-death', 'global', 'importance', 'come', 'see', 'toll', 'such', 'stress', 'brings', 'bear', 'even', 'men', 'who', 'tendency', 'romanticize', 'heroes', 'often', 'seem', 'superhuman', 'outside-looking-in', 'perspective.Despite', 'fact', 'movie', 'rarely', 'Washington', 'setting', 'are', 'still', 'afforded', 'chilling', 'images', 'life', 'outside', 'two', 'amazing', 'weeks', 'anchorman', 'Walter', 'Cronkite', 'intoning', 'bleak', 'sign-off', 'broadcast', 'one', 'gloomiest', 'hours', 'crisis', 'hordes', 'somber', 'Catholics', 'queuing', 'up', 'church', 'where', 'round-the-clock', 'confessions', 'have', 'been', 'instituted', 'masses', 'people', 'depleting', 'grocery', 'store', 'shelves', 'preparation', 'worst-possible-case', 'scenario.Kevin', 'Kostner', ""O'Donnell"", 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'JFK', 'Steven', 'Culp', 'RFK', 'deliver', 'superlative', 'portraits', 'serious', 'minded', 'compassionate', 'adults', 'who', 'comprehend', 'gravity', 'situation', 'find', 'most', 'amazing', 'Thirteen', 'Hours', 'even', 'already', 'know', 'how', 'going', 'end', 'still', 'find', 'caught', 'up', 'suspenseful', 'nature', 'situation', 'Particularly', 'gripping', 'scene', 'Adlai', 'Stevenson', 'then', 'U.S', 'Ambassador', 'U.N.', 'head-on', 'Soviet', 'ambassador', 'who', 'deny', 'truth', 'allegations', 'made', 'country', 'moment', 'high', 'political', 'emotional', 'conflict', 'worthy', 'Greek', 'Shakespearean', 'drama.One', 'makers', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'had', 'taken', 'same', 'approach', 'historical', 'event', 'makers', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'did', 'theirs', 'Then', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'spared', 'inane', 'puppy-love', 'scenario', 'sank', 'later', 'film', 'Imagine', 'focus', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'had', 'been', 'John', 'having', 'break', 'news', 'Marilyn', 'jealous', 'rheumy-eyed', 'Bobby', 'looked', 'wings', 'Thank', 'God', 'saner', 'heads', 'prevailed', 'have', 'film', 'subject', 'fascinating', 'lesson', 'history', 'gripping', 'study', 'human', 'behavior', 'time', 'crisis', 'Given', 'what', 'world', 'going', 'right', 'now', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'film', 'deeply', 'relevant', 'time']",N/A

582676,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00005J760,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[1, 5]","I was prepared to give this flick the benefit of the doubt, but an over-arching Hollywood phoniness undermines historical discussion.The script appears to tell the history of the Cuban Missile Crisis from the viewpoint of Kevin O'Donnell (Costner), a political advisor whom the script places at all high-level meetings. Instead, the script inverts the perspective: Costner's character becomes the pivotal character of the story, such that instead of showing us the crisis through his eyes, his POV becomes the story itself and places the near Armageddon into the status of a running sub-plot.  It's O'Donnell who gives a pep talk to Adlai Stevenson prior to Stevenson's famous showdown with the Russians at the UN; it's O'Donnell who gives a pep-talk to the luckless U-2 pilot immediately before he flies a doomed mission over Cuba; when a mysterious Russian appears, claiming to have a secret connection to Khrushchev, one that Americans can use to by-pass the military hawks of both countries, it's O'Donnell who verifies link by proving that the Russian served under Khrushchev in WWII; when RFK heads off for his fateful meeting with the Soviet Ambassador (Elya Baskin), who do you think is driving?; O'Donnell gets all the historically pivotal quotes, about the uncertainty of the situation, the stand-off between the White House and the Military, about America in the eyes of the world.  It's not impossible to make O'Donnell the center of the story without making him the centerpiece of history - but the script decides against that almost immediately.""Thirteen Days"" is also weighed down by its heavy-handed take on the nation's military - stuffed hawk's waiting WWIII with baited breath.  Generals like Curtis LeMay are typically the villains in lore of the crisis - no less so than the Soviets, and the White House had to face them down at least as much.  The film lampoons cold-war era hawks for their simplistic view of nuclear war and the Soviets, yet easily adopts a similarly black&white; attitude against our own generals.  At the very least, the film makes our military leadership look like idiots, with Robert McNamara having to tell USN officers how their Soviet counterparts might interpret warning shots.  While there was much evidence substantiating that view, ""Thirteen Days"" isn't interested in proving an historical case, and leaves little room for dissent.  The script's message, repeatedly hammered on us, is that America's civilian leadership narrowly saved the world from a thermonuclear war by carefully steering a course past the militaries of both countries - the actors who play Maxwell Taylor and Curtis LeMay blithely plan for a war they think is unavoidable. (The point is ironically made while Kennedy and the Chiefs of Staff discuss possible reprisals following the shoot-down of the U-2; the military amiably accepts the President's refusal to strike back, knowing that ""we'll just kick their [tails] on Monday"", the deadline for WWIII.While fans of this flick will alternatively excuse historical lapses because of the film's dramatic qualities, or ask the rest of us to overlook its thin melodrama for the sake of history, ""13"" fails at both because its characters lack any of the nuance essential in both in-depth historical analysis and superior drama. The film never even answers a question it unintentionally raises - if our military was about as bad as the Soviet generals, maybe that had more to do with getting the Russians to back down than the film's implicit answer - that the civilian leaders of both superpowers were good men surrounded by warmongers. The script also overlooks the importance of the U-2 shoot down as a wake-up call to the Russians (death is always a great wake-up call). Instead, the film implausibly credits a back-room deal in which the Yanks agreed to remove Jupiter missiles from Turkey. Yanking the Jupiters out of Turkey always struck me as a non-event in the overall crisis - the obsolete rockets were going to be scrapped anyway, and the conditions of the deal allowed the Americans to avoid any admission that they were backing down to induce the Russians to do the same in Cuba. In other words, why would the Russians back down as part of an agreement that gave them little political or military capital? Playing up the deal only substantiates Curt LeMay's insistence (if the flick is to be believed) that the Russians had to be dictated to rather than negotiated with. The rest of the film also suffers from Hollywood's general inability to craft historical characters who can speak in anything but historically significant dialog (RFK's car trip to the Soviet Embassy seems a good example - it's then that he confides his insecurities. ""I was never supposed to be the smart one"", he laments, obviously feeling less than up to the task of saving the world from WWIII).That said, ""Thirteen Days"" is not a bad film.  It's not historically inaccurate - merely a better-than-average Hollywood stab at history, one that should inspire you to look deeper into history than Hollywood will go.",3,Hollywood

582677,A3VKUKOO77NM7H,B00005J760,"Russell V. Olson Jr. ""The Colonel""","[1, 1]","The Cuban Missile Crisis brought the U.S. and the Soviet Union to the brink of nuclear conflict.  Fifteen years old at the time, I vividly remember this 13-day crisis.  Churches in my small hometown in South Carolina went on a 24-hour a day prayer vigil after President Kennedy addressed the nation on 22 October 1962 about the missiles in Cuba.  While reading ""Killing Lincoln,"" I decided to view ""Thirteen Days.""  The movie is entertaining, but some of the acting was over the top.  I also have a few minor criticisms:* At one point when a Soviet ship approached the quarantine line, a blue shell was loaded into a gun on-board a U.S. Navy ship.  Blue shells are training ammunition.* The instances of the President and Kenneth O'Donnell (a top presidential aide) by-passing the chain of command by reaching down to the ship's captain and two pilots strained credulity.* During my 30 years of active duty commissioned service, I never witnessed such blatant insubordination by a flag officer as depicted by an admiral to the Secretary of Defense (especially  in from of junior personnel).* Having spent two tours as a defense attach&eacute;, I cannot believe that Robert Kennedy (Attorney General) and Kenneth O'Donnell would be allowed to walk around or take the elevator unescorted inside the Soviet Embassy.

Over the next 13 days, the world sits on the brink of world war three as President Kennedy, his cabinet, and advisors go toe to toe with the Kremlin. The United States wants the missiles out of Cuba before they become operational and the Soviets deny their presence altogether.My Opinion:  I loved this movie. It was taught and very well acted. I went into it expecting Historical Fiction. I didn't expect it to be a documentary. So it didn't bother me to find out that Kenneth O'Donnell's role was exaggerated or that not everything was completely accurate. I can deal with dramatic license as long as they don't try to pretend that this is exactly what happened. If they had wanted to make a documentary they would have. But sometimes a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down. The accents didn't bother me one bit. I wouldn't even have noticed them except I liked how they said &quot;baaaastards&quot;. There is a full cast of characters who are all developed. They have emotions and weaknesses which makes them three dimensional and human.  It was exciting to see intelligent men at work in the White House and to see the sacrifices that they made to keep the rest of us safe. It made me proud to be an American no matter how corny that sounds.DVD Quality:  Widescreen Anamorphic 1.85:1 DD5.1 Excellent sound and picture. This DVD is called an Infinifilm edition.

The Soviets were firmly opposed to giving Castro nuclear weapons, until their secret services discovered these multiple American invasion strategies.

In retrospect, Kennedy's ultimate decision to implement a blockade despite earlier pushes to invade Cuba was wise, as Khruschev had ordered that any invasion would be met with nuclear retaliation, a fact that the United States was not yet aware of.This movie IS historically accurate. It is also quite entertaining, and an enlightening insight into the deliberations of the Executive Branch, the formation of United States foreign policy, and the practice of viewing yourself in the shoes of your enemy.

It's a good solid movie with Greenwood and Culp doing fairly decent impressions of JFK and RFK without trying to mimic them exactly.  Kevin Costner seems misplaced in this picture. He does a good job and is a fine actor, but his celebrity takes away from the overall effect of the movie.Did Kenny O'Donnell really have that much influence over events?  Was he really omnipresent at many meetings and conferences?  He was a powerful individual in the Kennedy White House, but Costner's presence raises those questions.  Was the character written for him so that he had more to do or is the history here correct?Costner does give the character life and doesn't intrude constantly on the event itself.  Actually, the biggest problem with his portrayal is he is the only actor present with major star power.  The other actors are fine and have been in other good films and do just as good a job, if not better, as Costner.  But Costner stands out, in part, because there is no other actor with his reputation present.  That provides a superficial problem for those familiar with his other work.This film does a great job at portraying the behind the scenes maneuvering during the Cuban Missle Crisis.  And it brings back the fears that I remember feeling when it happened.  Only 11 at the time, it seemed to me and many of my friends that the world as we knew it was about to disappear and us with it.Technically, I find the shifting from color to black and white a bit distracting.  It's done for effect to mirror the extensive use of black and white film in 1962 when compared to color but the changes don't seem to come at reasonable times.  In other words, why the color shift at the time chosen by the director?The second film is the DVD edition.  Seeing it with the Infinifilm feature really helps to explain the background history of the event.  When this feature is on, the viewer will be notified of times when more historical information about a scene or event is available, allow him to go to that information if he chooses and return to the film where he left off.  That's a fantastic learning tool and makes this film a cut above others.Too often, historical films condense events and give incorrect impressions of the role a particular person had in the event.  The Infinifilm process eliminates that problem and can answer questions the viewer may have as to what really happened.  It didn't satisfactorily answer the question of how much O'Donnell was involved in my view.  But I liked it nevertheless.The DVD is definitely a buy, especially if you are a student of history and/or lived during the crisis.",4,Two Different Films,1036022400,"10 31, 2002",2002,2693,"['really', 'are', 'two', 'different', 'films', 'here', 'first', 'movie', 'good', 'solid', 'movie', 'Greenwood', 'Culp', 'doing', 'fairly', 'decent', 'impressions', 'JFK', 'RFK', 'trying', 'mimic', 'exactly', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'misplaced', 'picture', 'good', 'job', 'fine', 'actor', 'celebrity', 'away', 'overall', 'effect', 'movie.Did', 'Kenny', ""O'Donnell"", 'really', 'have', 'much', 'influence', 'events', 'Was', 'really', 'omnipresent', 'many', 'meetings', 'conferences', 'was', 'powerful', 'individual', 'Kennedy', 'White', 'House', 'Costner', 'presence', 'questions', 'Was', 'character', 'written', 'so', 'had', 'more', 'do', 'history', 'here', 'correct', 'Costner', 'give', 'character', 'life', ""n't"", 'intrude', 'constantly', 'event', 'Actually', 'biggest', 'problem', 'portrayal', 'only', 'actor', 'present', 'major', 'star', 'power', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'fine', 'have', 'been', 'other', 'good', 'films', 'do', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'job', 'not', 'better', 'Costner', 'Costner', 'out', 'part', 'other', 'actor', 'reputation', 'present', 'superficial', 'problem', 'familiar', 'other', 'work.This', 'film', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'scenes', 'maneuvering', 'Cuban', 'Missle', 'Crisis', 'back', 'fears', 'remember', 'feeling', 'when', 'happened', 'Only', '11', 'time', 'seemed', 'many', 'friends', 'world', 'knew', 'was', 'disappear', 'it.Technically', 'find', 'shifting', 'color', 'black', 'white', 'bit', 'distracting', 'done', 'effect', 'mirror', 'extensive', 'use', 'black', 'white', 'film', '1962', 'when', 'compared', 'color', 'changes', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'come', 'reasonable', 'times', 'other', 'words', 'why', 'color', 'shift', 'time', 'chosen', 'director', 'second', 'film', 'DVD', 'edition', 'Seeing', 'Infinifilm', 'feature', 'really', 'explain', 'background', 'history', 'event', 'When', 'feature', 'viewer', 'will', 'be', 'notified', 'times', 'when', 'more', 'historical', 'information', 'scene', 'event', 'available', 'allow', 'go', 'information', 'return', 'film', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'fantastic', 'learning', 'tool', 'film', 'cut', 'others.Too', 'often', 'historical', 'films', 'condense', 'events', 'give', 'incorrect', 'impressions', 'role', 'particular', 'person', 'had', 'event', 'Infinifilm', 'process', 'problem', 'can', 'answer', 'questions', 'viewer', 'may', 'have', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'did', ""n't"", 'satisfactorily', 'answer', 'question', 'how', 'much', ""O'Donnell"", 'was', 'involved', 'view', 'liked', 'nevertheless.The', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'buy', 'especially', 'are', 'student', 'history', 'and/or', 'lived', 'crisis']",N/A

Kevin Costner plays the famous president of the United States, John F. Kennedy.

(He sounded like someone getting high on drugs.) Kevin's portrayal of JFK comes-up way short - he sounded and looked nothing like him.There's some genocide in the film, with some brutal war-scenes being valiantly fought between the heavily armed American and Cuban forces. There're some pretty gruesome details of this movie, that I would prefer not to divulge. The action drags-on for too long. This movie made me want to fall asleep, because I thought it was boring.

582696,AU5FOK67LBI7L,B00005J760,"thecastlebookroom ""thecastlebookroom""","[2, 3]","The scenario opens with this delemna: Soviet nuclear weapons are being installed in Cuba, with Washington D.C. and every major American military base (except Seattle) within range - leaving the U.S. just 5 minutes away from Soviet first-strike nuclear capability, and the ensuing deaths totalling something like 80 million! The Cubans have denied the missles' existence, the Soviets have denied their existence, and the rest of the world doesn't know of their existence.  As things unfold, Kennedy realizes that he has to go to war with the Soviet Union, or else somehow he has to negotiate the removal of the nuclear warheads with a hostile Soviet government, without tipping his airstrike plans to remove them forcibly if negotiations fail. To complicate matters, the military establishment and the intelligence community are seething with anger over Kennedy's refusal to engage an all-out attack on Cuba during the failed Bay of Pigs invasion, and view his detente stance as tantamount to treason, for his willingness to strike a compromise with the Soviet &quot;red-dog&quot; that's &quot;digging in OUR backyard!&quot;. They have a complete lack of confidence in his leadership, and a general consensus among themselves that the United States MUST engage the enemy in open warfare, up to and including open nuclear warfare!There are a lot of ways to view this film - political, historical, drama. I tend to agree with the comment that it represents a worthy case-study of effective leadership under pressure. As a historical lesson, it hits harder than they're allowed to in the school textbooks, for it reveals a deep rift of insubordination on the part of the pentagon, coupled with an intense pressure to engage in warfare without genuine provocation, by some of the nation's influential military and intelligence leaders at that time.How Kennedy utilized the military establishment to further his mission, despite their open hostility to his viewpoints and policies, how he deftly avoided being baited into open confrontation with his military leaders, how they chafed under his leadership and struggled to circumvent his decisions, and how he manged to get through the crisis without being coaxed, coerced, cornered, or outsmarted into declaring open war with Russia is a lesson worthy of study.Despite a few flaws (the family scenes with Kenny O'Donnell's wife &amp; kids are not well integrated, the b/w footage is distracting at times, there is a tad too much of O'Donnell [Costner] in the film), I give it 5 stars for great acting, excellent direction (you feel like a fly on the wall, observing the whole thing unwind), good pacing, and overall historical accuracy.Bruce Greenwood (JFK) and Steven Culp (Bobby Kennedy) deserve an award for their acting, but there are no weak performances in this film, and the confrontational scenes are electric with tension and testosterone. The subtlety of the body-language acting is impressive, and the photography/direction are also on an award-winning level.Not an action-thriller by any means, the tension here is more on a psychological/political level, with the impending threat of out-and-out nuclear war providing the &quot;sword of Damocles&quot; that hangs over Kennedy's every hard-wrought decision, and imbues the film with it's 'serious-business' demeanor. If you have the patience to sit for two and a half hours (almost) of history unfolding before your eyes, then I highly recommend this well-presented docu-drama of a decidedly important chapter of recent American history that is often skipped-over lightly in the textbooks.",5,a history lesson that hits with the gloves off,995846400,"07 23, 2001",2001,3595,"['scenario', 'delemna', 'Soviet', 'nuclear', 'weapons', 'are', 'being', 'installed', 'Cuba', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'major', 'American', 'military', 'base', 'Seattle', 'range', 'leaving', 'U.S.', 'just', '5', 'minutes', 'away', 'Soviet', 'first-strike', 'nuclear', 'capability', 'ensuing', 'deaths', 'totalling', 'something', '80', 'million', 'Cubans', 'have', 'denied', 'missles', 'existence', 'Soviets', 'have', 'denied', 'existence', 'rest', 'world', ""n't"", 'know', 'existence', 'things', 'unfold', 'Kennedy', 'go', 'war', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'else', 'somehow', 'negotiate', 'removal', 'nuclear', 'warheads', 'hostile', 'Soviet', 'government', 'tipping', 'airstrike', 'plans', 'remove', 'forcibly', 'negotiations', 'fail', 'complicate', 'matters', 'military', 'establishment', 'intelligence', 'community', 'are', 'seething', 'anger', 'Kennedy', 'refusal', 'engage', 'all-out', 'attack', 'Cuba', 'failed', 'Bay', 'Pigs', 'invasion', 'view', 'detente', 'stance', 'tantamount', 'treason', 'willingness', 'strike', 'compromise', 'Soviet', 'quot', 'red-dog', 'quot', 'quot', 'digging', 'OUR', 'backyard', 'quot', 'have', 'complete', 'lack', 'confidence', 'leadership', 'general', 'consensus', 'United', 'States', 'MUST', 'engage', 'enemy', 'open', 'warfare', 'up', 'including', 'open', 'nuclear', 'warfare', 'are', 'lot', 'ways', 'view', 'film', 'political', 'historical', 'drama', 'tend', 'agree', 'comment', 'worthy', 'case-study', 'effective', 'leadership', 'pressure', 'historical', 'lesson', 'harder', ""'re"", 'allowed', 'school', 'textbooks', 'deep', 'rift', 'insubordination', 'part', 'pentagon', 'coupled', 'intense', 'pressure', 'engage', 'warfare', 'genuine', 'provocation', 'nation', 'influential', 'military', 'intelligence', 'leaders', 'time.How', 'Kennedy', 'utilized', 'military', 'establishment', 'further', 'mission', 'open', 'hostility', 'viewpoints', 'policies', 'how', 'deftly', 'avoided', 'being', 'baited', 'open', 'confrontation', 'military', 'leaders', 'how', 'chafed', 'leadership', 'struggled', 'circumvent', 'decisions', 'how', 'manged', 'get', 'crisis', 'being', 'coaxed', 'coerced', 'cornered', 'outsmarted', 'declaring', 'open', 'war', 'Russia', 'lesson', 'worthy', 'study.Despite', 'few', 'flaws', 'family', 'scenes', 'Kenny', ""O'Donnell"", 'wife', 'amp', 'kids', 'are', 'not', 'well', 'integrated', 'b/w', 'footage', 'distracting', 'times', 'tad', 'too', 'much', ""O'Donnell"", '[', 'Costner', ']', 'film', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'great', 'acting', 'excellent', 'direction', 'feel', 'fly', 'wall', 'observing', 'whole', 'thing', 'unwind', 'good', 'pacing', 'overall', 'historical', 'accuracy.Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'JFK', 'Steven', 'Culp', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'deserve', 'award', 'acting', 'are', 'weak', 'performances', 'film', 'confrontational', 'scenes', 'are', 'electric', 'tension', 'testosterone', 'subtlety', 'body-language', 'acting', 'impressive', 'photography/direction', 'are', 'also', 'award-winning', 'level.Not', 'action-thriller', 'means', 'tension', 'here', 'more', 'psychological/political', 'level', 'impending', 'threat', 'out-and-out', 'nuclear', 'war', 'providing', 'quot', 'sword', 'Damocles', 'quot', 'Kennedy', 'hard-wrought', 'decision', 'film', ""'serious-business"", 'demeanor', 'have', 'patience', 'sit', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'almost', 'history', 'unfolding', 'eyes', 'then', 'highly', 'recommend', 'well-presented', 'docu-drama', 'decidedly', 'important', 'chapter', 'recent', 'American', 'history', 'often', 'skipped-over', 'lightly', 'textbooks']",N/A

Granted, the portrayed managing of the Crisis takes on some cinematic liberties, but I think that it's reasonably close and the visual/emotional effects more than offset the historical inaccuracies (I don't believe the filmakers meant to make this a documentary...).

Director Roger Donaldson does a great job of representing the true agendas of US politicians in JFK's administration, with the military men wanting war as it generates billions (also mentioned on JFK), diplomats wanting UN-debated solutions, media men wanting the scoop, and the Kennedy's wanting peace.Steven Culp is excellent as Bobby Kennedy, the ying to JFK's yang, portrayed as the 'bad brother' who doesn't want to be the 'bad brother'. Perhaps the best performance given is by Michael Fairman as US Ambassador to the United Nations, Adlai Stevenson. Stevenson believes that he has committed 'political suicide' after arguing against nuclear war and trying for diplomatic solutions, but shows courage under fire in a Security Council meeting later on.The DVD itself is more than impressive! DVD fans such as myself often criticise studios for padding two-disc sets and special editions with worthless selfpraise cast interviews and TV spots, but Thirteen Days rises above many with indepth and informative extra features. The idea of Infinifilm is a revolutionary technique, and allows you to access info about parts of the film as it plays. One of the most useful extras is a section including short video biographies of most important political and military figures involved with the crisis, including Castro and Khrushchev, along with rundowns of their political pasts and views.The historical commentary is nothing short of brilliant, and a first for DVD studios, piecing together various audio to add to the historical angle of the film. The documentary, Roots of the Cuban Missile Crisis; Bringing History to the Silver Screen, is very interesting to watch, and the DVD includes many more extras for viewers who can't get enough, and does not include anything not worth watching at least one.I cannot recommend this film or this DVD enough! Forget Costner's accent and watch this for the tension and a look at the White House war room in full swing.

582703,ALN0TTRTLHA4E,B00005J760,"Tom Munro ""tomfrombrunswick""","[2, 4]","This is actually an interesting film and the DVD contains as an extra a documentary on the Cuban Missile Crisis.It is now some time since the Cuban Missile Crisis so that probably most people have forgotten what it was about. In the early 1960's the United States had a relatively week army but an immense strength in nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union had a limited number of long range nuclear weapons but an immensely strong army. It was generally conceded by the US military that it could conquer Western Europe in 48 hours. The military balance was based on the threat of the US using nuclear weapons if the peace of Western Europe was threatened.In 1961 the United States sponsored an invasion of Cuba by some dissident exiles. This expedition failed. The Soviet Union started to build up Cuba's defences to prevent another invasion. At the same time short range ballistic missiles with nuclear weapons were put on the island which brought most US cities into target range. It was the discovery of these weapons that led to the missile crisis.The film covers the 13 days of the crisis and thus the name. The difficulty was what to do. Kennedy's military advisors suggested a military strike to destroy the missiles and then a follow up invasion of Cuba. The basis of this was a belief that the US nuclear superiority would guarantee that the Soviets would not retaliate. Kennedy however was concerned that this might not happen. He was familiar with the history of the First World War. In that conflict a series of &quot;correct&quot; military decisions had led to a senseless mass horror. If the US invaded Cuba it would be easy for the Soviets to seize Berlin. Could the US then use nuclear weapons? One would think not.As a result Kennedy set up a broad-based set of advisors who came up with the strategy of a blockade. However each of the 13 days of the crisis set up challenges which might have at any time led to a conflict. If spy planes were shot down, should the US retaliate? If the US fired at Russian transport ships bringing in weapons would escorting submarines retaliate?The Cuban missile crisis was the high point of Kennedy's presidency when he made objectively the correct decision against military advice. It later turned out that the local Soviet Commanders had short range nuclear weapons and were authorised to use them if an invasion had occurred. An invasion could have been catastrophic.The film accurately describes the time and all of the actors are excellent. The film also does not try to play the audience for idiots and the dramatic pacing is good. One of the best historical films in years. Incidentally the DVD contains an excellent documentary on the crisis. Many documentaries are static and rely on visual imagery. This is a good punchy talking heads documentary which conveys information quickly and accurately.

582705,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B00005J760,Trevor Willsmer,"[9, 10]","Sometimes Kevin Costner just can't be told. On Tin Cup he couldn't be told that a scene of him beating a security guard to a bloody pulp because he forgot his ID card wasn't going to endear him to the audience in a romcom (I never saw the finished film, but I believe the preview audiences succeeded in getting that scene cut). In The Postman he couldn't be told that ending a film with a statue of him being unveiled was really not a good idea. At all. And in Thirteen Days he couldn't be told that adopting a Boston accent was not a good idea when it makes him sound just like Elmer Fudd. For the first quarter of an hour you're just waiting for him to say ""Be wewwy, wewwy qwuiet. I'm hunting Wussian Miss-eyells."" So it's a testament to the strength of the film that it survives that hurdle and emerges as a gripping thriller even though we all know the ending.Although Costner gets top billing, the film really belongs to Bruce Greenwood and Steven Culp as JFK and Bobby Kennedy, avoiding impersonation (and the accent) to give quite superb performances. While the film is occasionally guilty of overglamorizing the dynamic duo, it's surprising to see just how little control they were able to exercise over the Chiefs of Staff who seemed hell-bent on escalating the Cuban Missile Crisis into a full-scale invasion. Considering the final result, it seems particularly timely now to see a drama about a president desperate to avoid a pointless war over weapons of mass destruction that he knows do exist: for all the corruption, spin and dilettantism of the Kennedy administration, this was one of those fortuitous examples of the right leader at the right time.The film certainly manages to pull off the rare achievement of instilling a real sense of pride not in action but in diplomacy, with most of the drama taking place in conference rooms (although there are a couple of genuinely exciting pieces of filmmaking in the spy flights over Cuba). Indeed, perhaps the most genuinely stirring moment is Adlai Stevenson calling the Russian ambassador's bluff at the UN, the sort of thing which doesn't exactly pull in the kids at the multiplex. This doesn't always pay dividends, however. The biggest problem is that it loses tension by being so confined to the political and military players: there's no sense of the very real fear that spread throughout the world that this really was IT and that the mushroom clouds would start sprouting any minute. As a result the movie does begin to lose its grip towards the end, and doesn't entirely dodge mawkishness. The sporadic early shifts from color to black and white are a real failure, too. With the archive footage in color, there simply seems no reason for them, and they seem to have been thrown in arbitrarily purely to give it an imagined cutting edge. Still, they're fairly minor flaws in an impressive thriller.The extras on the disc are very impressive too, particularly the 50-minute historical documentary and the video portraits of the real key players.",4,A surprisingly gripping political thriller,1156636800,"08 27, 2006",2006,3017,"['Sometimes', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'told', 'Tin', 'Cup', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'told', 'scene', 'beating', 'security', 'guard', 'bloody', 'pulp', 'forgot', 'ID', 'card', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'endear', 'audience', 'romcom', 'never', 'saw', 'finished', 'film', 'believe', 'preview', 'audiences', 'succeeded', 'getting', 'scene', 'cut', 'Postman', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'told', 'ending', 'film', 'statue', 'being', 'unveiled', 'was', 'really', 'not', 'good', 'idea', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'told', 'adopting', 'Boston', 'accent', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'idea', 'when', 'sound', 'just', 'Elmer', 'Fudd', 'first', 'quarter', 'hour', ""'re"", 'just', 'waiting', 'say', 'Be', 'wewwy', 'wewwy', 'qwuiet', ""'m"", 'hunting', 'Wussian', 'Miss-eyells', 'testament', 'strength', 'film', 'hurdle', 'gripping', 'thriller', 'even', 'know', 'ending.Although', 'Costner', 'top', 'billing', 'film', 'really', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'Steven', 'Culp', 'JFK', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'avoiding', 'impersonation', 'accent', 'give', 'quite', 'superb', 'performances', 'film', 'occasionally', 'guilty', 'overglamorizing', 'dynamic', 'duo', 'surprising', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'little', 'control', 'were', 'able', 'exercise', 'Chiefs', 'Staff', 'who', 'seemed', 'hell-bent', 'escalating', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'full-scale', 'invasion', 'Considering', 'final', 'result', 'particularly', 'timely', 'now', 'see', 'drama', 'president', 'desperate', 'avoid', 'pointless', 'war', 'weapons', 'mass', 'destruction', 'do', 'exist', 'corruption', 'spin', 'dilettantism', 'Kennedy', 'administration', 'was', 'one', 'fortuitous', 'examples', 'right', 'leader', 'right', 'time.The', 'film', 'certainly', 'pull', 'off', 'rare', 'achievement', 'instilling', 'real', 'sense', 'pride', 'not', 'action', 'diplomacy', 'most', 'drama', 'taking', 'place', 'conference', 'rooms', 'are', 'couple', 'genuinely', 'exciting', 'pieces', 'filmmaking', 'spy', 'flights', 'Cuba', 'Indeed', 'perhaps', 'most', 'genuinely', 'stirring', 'moment', 'Adlai', 'Stevenson', 'calling', 'Russian', 'ambassador', 'bluff', 'UN', 'sort', 'thing', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'pull', 'kids', 'multiplex', ""n't"", 'always', 'pay', 'dividends', 'however', 'biggest', 'problem', 'tension', 'being', 'so', 'confined', 'political', 'military', 'players', 'sense', 'very', 'real', 'fear', 'spread', 'world', 'really', 'was', 'IT', 'mushroom', 'clouds', 'would', 'start', 'sprouting', 'minute', 'result', 'movie', 'begin', 'lose', 'grip', 'end', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'dodge', 'mawkishness', 'sporadic', 'early', 'shifts', 'color', 'black', 'white', 'are', 'real', 'failure', 'too', 'archive', 'footage', 'color', 'simply', 'reason', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'thrown', 'arbitrarily', 'purely', 'give', 'imagined', 'cutting', 'edge', 'Still', ""'re"", 'fairly', 'minor', 'flaws', 'impressive', 'thriller.The', 'extras', 'disc', 'are', 'very', 'impressive', 'too', 'particularly', '50-minute', 'historical', 'documentary', 'video', 'portraits', 'real', 'key', 'players']",N/A

Contrary to what many critics have suggested, the film is fairly historically accurate. Events are compressed, as they almost always are in historical movies and a few details have been changed to make the film flow better. However, other than that, the movie is pretty true to history. The major difference between this and most Hollywood history films is that the drama is built through a cast of everymen. Costner stars, but he's more the narrator. The film illustrates how there wasn't one villian or hero in the Crisis.Kevin Costner stars in the best role he has played since the father he played in THE WAR. His Bostonian accent is a little off, but he does better than many who have tried. Bruce Greenwood studied the life of JFK intensely to prepare for his role as President Kennedy. He gets most of the mannerisms and characteristics correctly, but he didn't even try the accent. I may be biased, but I can't think of JFK without thinking of that twangy Bostonian accent. Steven Culp is great as Attorney General Bobby Kennedy. Out of the three main leads, he hits the nail on the head.I enjoyed watching the film, but it failed to rivet me in my seat.

Thirteen Days is not an exception.  It's blend of history and pure entertainment is a mix that is hard to beat.  And with stunning performances by all of the cast.  It makes it hard to say one bad thing about it.  The story is about the thirteen days of the Cuban Missle Crisis where the Russian government strategically set up missles sites in cuba to launch against the western civilization.  Costner plays Kenny Odonnell, Chief Political Advisor to the President of the United States.  Roger Donaldson' s movie moves quickly and really tells a great story.

I cringed every time Costner opened his mouth. He was trying to mimic a Boston accent, and it actually came out like Forrest Gump on speed. Second, from my study of history I know that the actual events were far more more gripping than what's depicted here. It would seem a real challenge to turn one of history's most dire and suspenseful crises into a bumbling melodrama. The best part of the film was Steven Culp's depiction of Bobby Kennedy. His was the only solid performance. Third, the film would have us believe that we might have been obliterated in a nuclear holocaust if not for Kennedy aide Ken O'Donnell. Using this character's point-of-view could have been an interesting device, but the film amplifies O'Donnell's importance to the point of upstaging JFK himself, which is pretty ludicrous. Aside from the historical dishonesty, the technique fails because it's just so transparent.

Best I've seen, and there have been a number of movies in the last few years about JFK, with a variety of actors in that role...Greenwood captured everything about Kennedy from body language, accent, and demeanor...Very faithful to the book and the main characters.

582716,A35PRTXTXU9EZF,B00005J760,William T. Parnell,"[2, 2]","Roger Donaldson's Thirteen Days which portrays the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, is a political drama that is sure to please those who enjoyed films such as Oliver Stone's JFK, with which it will no doubt be compared. The DVD release is loaded with features for those who want to further explore this cold war confrontation between the superpowers.Kevin Cosner stars as Kenny O'Donnell who served as a special assistant to JFK. Much has been said about Cosner's attempt at a &quot;JFK&quot; style accent. One wonders why he bothered since the real O'Donnell (as heard in the audio special features) had no such pronounced way of speech. The answer seems to be a desire to link the three main characters in the mind of the audience. Bruce Greenwood and Steven Culp are fine as JFK and RFK respectively. Greenwood doesn't really look like JFK but he makes up for this with a great vocal impression of the 35th President.Thirteen Days does have its share of problems. The black and white scenes intended to remind the viewer of famous photos and news footage don't work especially when compared to the techniques Stone used in JFK to achieve a similar effect. The portrayal of the Kennedys may be a little too sentimental for some. And it seems that in reality O'Donnell did not appear very often on the White House recordings made during the crisis and in fact may have played a relatively minor role. All in all though the film seems reasonably accurate much more so than JFK, which seamlessly mixed fact and fiction.The video and audio quality here are top notch. The extras are numerous and in this &quot;infinifilm&quot; presentation from New Line Entertainment they can be accessed during or after the film. The features include commentary, deleted/reduced scenes, two documentaries, a visual effects study and DVD ROM capability.If you are a fan of political drama you will be well pleased with this film and especially with the DVD version and it's array of extras.
