1613200,A2E2SLJBY2QT24,B00ALYYTE8,CurlyTop,"[0, 1]","I love great spy thrillers, like MI5 or 24 or Alias.  But this is not in the same league.I was wondering why, and i think it has a lot to do with the face that the female lead does not have a strong talented ensemble cast, with their own story lines, to strengthen the plot.  MI5 has the main agents, and then Harry - and always a superb cast of well- explored characters.  Alias was always focused on Garner, but you got to know the other characters and their stories really well too.  Here, 99% rests on George - she does her best, but its too much for one person to carry off.  I guess they were going more for the one-person superspy model, like Bond or Bourne, but its still a little weak.  The characters, including George, often look like their pouting or just hanging out, instead of looking tortured or being on edge or tense, as the scene might demand.  But overall, its still entertaining and very watchable.",3,"Good spy thriller, but could be better",1398038400,"04 21, 2014",2014,919,"['love', 'great', 'spy', 'thrillers', 'MI5', '24', 'Alias', 'not', 'same', 'league.I', 'was', 'wondering', 'why', 'i', 'think', 'lot', 'do', 'face', 'female', 'lead', 'not', 'have', 'strong', 'talented', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'own', 'story', 'lines', 'strengthen', 'plot', 'MI5', 'main', 'agents', 'then', 'Harry', 'always', 'superb', 'cast', 'well-', 'explored', 'characters', 'Alias', 'was', 'always', 'focused', 'Garner', 'got', 'know', 'other', 'characters', 'stories', 'really', 'well', 'too', 'Here', '99', '%', 'rests', 'George', 'best', 'too', 'much', 'one', 'person', 'carry', 'off', 'guess', 'were', 'going', 'more', 'one-person', 'superspy', 'model', 'Bond', 'Bourne', 'still', 'little', 'weak', 'characters', 'including', 'George', 'often', 'look', 'pouting', 'just', 'hanging', 'out', 'instead', 'looking', 'tortured', 'being', 'edge', 'tense', 'scene', 'might', 'demand', 'overall', 'still', 'entertaining', 'very', 'watchable']",Hunted: Season 1

1613202,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00ALYYTE8,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[16, 16]","&#34;Hunted&#34; is an eight part British espionage drama created by Frank Spotnitz, who worked on some of &#34;The X-Files&#34; most memorable episodes as a producer and writer.  Premiering on both BBC1 in England and Cinemax in America, it seems unlikely (as of this review date) that the program will return for a second season with BBC1 having already passed on its option and Cinemax still considering its position.  So, I think it's best to view &#34;Hunted&#34; as a self-contained entity and judge it as one complete story.  It's a shame, though, I think it had the potential to develop into something richer and more intriguing with different narrative threads.  While many have tried to label this as some sort of an &#34;Alias&#34; clone (it even stars one of that show's alums, Melissa George), I don't really see the comparison as apt.  Both programs have international intrigue, a strong female protagonist and plenty of fisticuffs.  &#34;Hunted,&#34; though, is not episodic.  It has a singular plot, for the most part, that unravels over the course of the season.Episode One is pure spy drama set-up.  George works for an independent firm called Byzantium whose services are available to the highest bidder.  Something goes awry on a complex mission and someone seems to have betrayed George.  Not knowing whom to trust, she drops out of view until she is strong enough to plot her return.  When she reappears, it is with a singular purpose to find out who set her up and to make them pay.  She is wary of those around her, including a former flame, but she jumps right into a undercover assignment.  She takes a position in the household of a wealthy hood and his family.  I won't reveal too much of the plot line, it really doesn't matter.  As she infiltrates the scene in subsequent episodes, she must also contend with a mystery man that may be a friend or a foe and a bigger twist that somehow involves her childhood.  In truth, some of the action is fairly compelling but some of the labyrinthine plotting remains somewhat vague.I had mixed feelings about &#34;Hunted.&#34;The Good:I liked the concept of Byzantium.  On other shows where the spies work for a government, they are inherently good or bad.  As Byzantium was a paid service, our heroes could potentially be working in the employ of villains.A top notch supporting cast including Adam Rayner, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Stephen Dillane, Patrick Malahide, Stephen Campbell Moore and Indira Varma.Liked George's back story and the betrayal storyline, good action set pieces.The Bad:The finale pushes beyond credibility a step too far.Early episodes have little action, just George skulking around the house.  It's not a big place, but she wanders around undetected time after time after time.  A bit repetitive.The Indifferent:I like George, I really do, but she has a perpetual pout!  Instead of perceiving her as disinterested, though, everyone is still instantly enamored of her.Her bonding with the kid is a little forced as is her place in the family.There were parts of &#34;Hunted&#34; that I really liked.  Midway through the season, there were some super strong episodes.  But the pacing was inconsistent, at best.  But still, I think it's worth a look if you enjoy these types of programs.  About 3 1/2 stars overall (individual episodes ranked anywhere from 2 stars to 4 1/2 stars).
