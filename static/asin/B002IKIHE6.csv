Yes, his schtick is fairly predictable, but I still find him funny and likeable.  He is the reason I gave this a shot, and I'm glad I did.If they hadn't called this ""Land of the Lost"" I don't think it would've rubbed so many people the wrong way.  They could've tweaked it just a bit to move it away from the tv show, and it would've been fine, without all the baggage.Anyway, this is a light-hearted, goofy movie with good performances.  I especially like Danny McBride and Jorma Taccone - they do an excellent job in their respective roles.THere are a lot of very funny situations and plenty of quotable lines.  And I really like that this stays true to its own goofy vision all the way to the end.  I personally hate it when comedies feel the need to ""have heart"" or get sappy in the final third.  Pathos and poignancy can have a place in comedies, but you don't have to suddenly forget that you're making a comedy to include those.I think the bottom line is that if you go in with low expectations you might be pleasantly surprised.

I mean, it has Will Ferrell in it, and we all know how much I love his tacky yet hilarious approach to comedy.  Anyways, I was preparing myself for a disaster of `Year One' proportions (that movie was just downright AWFUL) when I was blindsided by laughter.Twin, what the heck?  This movie is NOT that bad, like at all!Okay, so this movie has its moments of ridiculousness, and not everything works (it's rare that a Will Ferrell movie works on all levels) but overall this movie was far from the disappointment I was expecting.  In fact, I saved it onto my DVR so I could watch it again later.The basic plot revolves around a shamed scientist named Marshall who was laughed out of his profession after he pimped out a nonsensical theory.  Years later he is confronted by a young woman who followed his career (at her own careers expense) and prompts him to pick up where he left off (creating some strange machine that will allow them to jump time to another dimension).  Well, the machine works (believe it or not) and the odd couple wind up in Dino-land with a grungy owner of a tacky desert `adventure'.  When there, they are befriended by a monkey-boy and then summoned by a lizard-man to find the machine Marshall created (which got lost as they came through the time portal) before some evil lizard-man does.  All the while they are being hunted by a T-rex who was offended when Marshall commented on the size of its brain.I'm telling you, this movie is actually funny.Sure, it pushes the envelope in scenes and winds up becoming too tacky for it's own good (sometimes off-color is just off-color, nothing more or less) but it manages to deliver a fun homage to the TV-show (I love how the graphics are obviously better than the original yet they also posses a campy and cheesy quality to them) and along the way there are plenty of belly laughs.Don't let the clich&eacute;s and the naysayers bring this movie down; it's well worth seeing at least once!",3,I actually liked this movie!,1284940800,"09 20, 2010",2010,2058,"['fact', 'evil', 'twin', 'told', 'movie', 'was', 'horrendous', 'just', 'had', 'see', 'mean', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'tacky', 'yet', 'hilarious', 'approach', 'comedy', 'Anyways', 'was', 'preparing', 'disaster', 'Year', 'One', 'proportions', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'downright', 'AWFUL', 'when', 'was', 'blindsided', 'laughter.Twin', 'what', 'heck', 'movie', 'NOT', 'bad', 'Okay', 'movie', 'moments', 'ridiculousness', 'not', 'everything', 'works', 'rare', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'movie', 'levels', 'overall', 'movie', 'was', 'far', 'disappointment', 'was', 'expecting', 'fact', 'saved', 'DVR', 'could', 'watch', 'again', 'later.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'revolves', 'shamed', 'scientist', 'named', 'Marshall', 'who', 'was', 'laughed', 'profession', 'pimped', 'out', 'nonsensical', 'theory', 'Years', 'later', 'confronted', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'followed', 'career', 'own', 'careers', 'expense', 'pick', 'up', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'creating', 'strange', 'machine', 'will', 'allow', 'jump', 'time', 'dimension', 'Well', 'machine', 'believe', 'not', 'odd', 'couple', 'wind', 'up', 'Dino-land', 'grungy', 'owner', 'tacky', 'desert', 'adventure', 'When', 'are', 'befriended', 'monkey-boy', 'then', 'summoned', 'lizard-man', 'find', 'machine', 'Marshall', 'created', 'got', 'lost', 'came', 'time', 'portal', 'evil', 'lizard-man', 'are', 'being', 'hunted', 'T-rex', 'who', 'was', 'offended', 'when', 'Marshall', 'commented', 'size', 'brain.I', ""'m"", 'telling', 'movie', 'actually', 'funny.Sure', 'envelope', 'scenes', 'up', 'becoming', 'too', 'tacky', 'own', 'good', 'sometimes', 'off-color', 'just', 'off-color', 'nothing', 'more', 'less', 'deliver', 'fun', 'homage', 'TV-show', 'love', 'how', 'graphics', 'are', 'obviously', 'better', 'original', 'yet', 'also', 'campy', 'cheesy', 'quality', 'way', 'are', 'plenty', 'belly', 'laughs.Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'clich', 'eacute', 'naysayers', 'bring', 'movie', 'down', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'least', 'once']",N/A

They kept enough of the original concept to make me happy such as the Sleestaks, the weird pyramid portals, and the dinosaurs which were, of course, infinitely better than their stop-motion counterparts from 1974.  I was somewhat concerned about this being a Will Ferrell vehicle, though, despite his ability to handle camp and kitsch.  It turned out that he was okay in this.  The problem I had, as with most Will Ferrell vehicles, is the crude scatological humor.  Unfortunately, this film is marred by some gross-out scatological gags which I felt were completely unnecessary.  Speaking for myself, I don't care for gross-out toilet humor.Despite that complaint, realizing that this movie would NOT be the Sid & Marty Kroft kid show I remember so fondly from my youth, I largely enjoyed it.  The acting from Ferrell and Danny McBride was the standard fare you'd expect from them, but they did make me laugh.  Anna Friel played her part in a much less over-the-top manner and was a delight to watch.  The effects were great, and the original concept of the Land of the Lost being something more akin to a parallel reality was kept intact.  The crystals were there, the pyramid portals were there, the Sleestaks looked great and managed to be fairly creepy and menacing and it was really cool hearing Leonard Nimoy voicing one of them.  I'm very fond of the original series and I went with two people who had no knowledge of the original, and we all found the film enjoyable as light, silly, campy entertainment.If you are a fan of the original series and take it seriously, you will likely be disappointed.  However, if you go into it expecting silly, fun entertainment, and especially if you have a liking for sci-fi, then check out Land of the Lost.  I think you'll enjoy it.  I would give it a 3  stars out of five, but since I can't do half stars, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and props for getting Leonard Nimoy in there and give it four out of five stars.Cheers!Brent",4,Fun and silly entertainment!,1255478400,"10 14, 2009",2009,2188,"['have', 'say', 'was', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'far', 'removed', 'original', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'TV', 'series', 'mostly', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Land', 'Lost', 'movie', 'kept', 'enough', 'original', 'concept', 'make', 'happy', 'such', 'Sleestaks', 'weird', 'pyramid', 'portals', 'dinosaurs', 'were', 'course', 'infinitely', 'better', 'stop-motion', 'counterparts', '1974', 'was', 'somewhat', 'concerned', 'being', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'vehicle', 'though', 'ability', 'handle', 'camp', 'kitsch', 'turned', 'out', 'was', 'okay', 'problem', 'had', 'most', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'vehicles', 'crude', 'scatological', 'humor', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'marred', 'gross-out', 'scatological', 'gags', 'felt', 'were', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'Speaking', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'gross-out', 'toilet', 'humor.Despite', 'complaint', 'realizing', 'movie', 'would', 'NOT', 'be', 'Sid', 'Marty', 'Kroft', 'kid', 'show', 'remember', 'so', 'fondly', 'youth', 'largely', 'enjoyed', 'acting', 'Ferrell', 'Danny', 'McBride', 'was', 'standard', 'fare', ""'d"", 'expect', 'did', 'make', 'Anna', 'Friel', 'played', 'part', 'much', 'less', 'over-the-top', 'manner', 'was', 'delight', 'watch', 'effects', 'were', 'great', 'original', 'concept', 'Land', 'Lost', 'being', 'something', 'more', 'akin', 'parallel', 'reality', 'was', 'kept', 'intact', 'crystals', 'were', 'there', 'pyramid', 'portals', 'were', 'there', 'Sleestaks', 'looked', 'great', 'managed', 'be', 'fairly', 'creepy', 'menacing', 'was', 'really', 'cool', 'hearing', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'voicing', 'one', ""'m"", 'very', 'fond', 'original', 'series', 'went', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'knowledge', 'original', 'found', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'light', 'silly', 'campy', 'entertainment.If', 'are', 'fan', 'original', 'series', 'take', 'seriously', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'disappointed', 'However', 'go', 'expecting', 'silly', 'fun', 'entertainment', 'especially', 'have', 'liking', 'sci-fi', 'then', 'check', 'out', 'Land', 'Lost', 'think', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'would', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'five', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'stars', ""'ll"", 'give', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'props', 'getting', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'give', 'four', 'five', 'stars.Cheers', 'Brent']",N/A

E Jackson,"[2, 2]","I'm confused about something though- I used to wake up every Saturday morning as a child and would watch a show called Land of the Lost, but apparently this film is in NO way related to that old television series because this is definitely a comedy film, and I don't remember very many comedy elements in the Saturday morning TV show.Land of the Lost is an alright movie.  Actually I enjoyed many moments of it.  I don't think it's strictly a comedy like many other people do- I felt that a huge portion of this film was dedicated to some mildly enjoyable action bits involving Will Ferrell and his friends running away from dinosaurs, along with the scenes where the characters had to deal with the alien creatures.  These were good moments.I'd even go so far as to say the adventure aspect was quite captivating in several spots as well.  The special animations making it appear like the dinosaurs were really there and chasing after the people was realistic and satisfying to watch.I didn't quite understand how certain things like a bus, a motel and a swimming pool somehow crossed to the other side where Will Ferrell and his friends were located on that strange piece of land.  Perhaps I simply missed an important storyline element explaining all this.I liked the scene where a HUGE bug came out of nowhere and bit Will Ferrell on his neck (and back) while he was playing his guitar.  Mosquitos from another time can be even WORSE apparently- makes me feel fortunate, haha.What I especially liked was how Will Ferrell's typically overbearing and obnoxious behavior has been toned down considerably here, perhaps for the purpose of making a movie for children.  He's still somewhat obnoxious and annoying (like in several other films) but it's honestly not THAT bad.Interesting moment when they played Seals and Crofts ""Summer Breeze"".  Literally 15 minutes before this song was played I was actually thinking about that band because their greatest hits album cover shows a picture of the two of them standing on a piece of land similar to the one in this movie.

Without a plot and trying to force the comedy down our throats, this newly reinvented LAND OF THE LOST is a complete disaster. Yes, even with the much improved CGI effects.The film tries to pull in fans of the original by sucking the cast into a time vortex, similar to how Marshall, Will and Holly were in the original. But instead of being scientifically interesting (if outdated and impossible), this time we get some serious low-brow comedy that misses almost every mark.Those of you out there who also are not fans of Will Ferrell (Talladega Nights) will want to avoid this film like the plague. He's in full-on childish mode, getting more groans than laughs (trying to make out with a proto-human while high on a hallucinogenic? Yes. Those kind of antics!). And he's in the lead role as Dr. Rick Marshall, so he's on screen in just about every shot.His supporting cast are just as lame as he, unfortunately. Anna Friel stars as Holly, and her interactions and supposed romantic attraction to Ferrell's Marshall character are probably what'll give most of you a good laugh. It's so unrealistic you'll wish that she'd disappear down another vortex.The more unfortunate cast member, Danny McBride (Tropic Thunder) as Will Stanton, the owner of an extremely destitute theme park ride, plays the fool more often than Ferrell's character, and not in a good way (is there one?). Which is too bad, really, as I like McBride in Tropic Thunder and SUPERBAD.There's not much here to enjoy (in case you didn't notice my review rating). More groans than laughs.

I had a lot of fun just trying to spot all the odd objects scattered about those scenes.The characters have different relationships than the old show. Holly is ""all grown up"", and very pleasingly so.And someone bemoaned the character development? They should pay attention.

It was super low budget, but written by a bunch of renowned Science Fiction writers like Larry NivenDestroyer of Worlds, Ben BovaThe Immortality Factor, and even Star Trek actor Walter Koenig!! The main writers of course were Sid and Marty Krofft who worked on this theatrical release as well, along side Chris Henchy who writes for Entourage and Eastbound and Down.Land of the Lost stars Will Ferrell as Dr. Rick Marshall, Anna Friel as Holly Cantrell, Danny Mcbride as Will Stanton, Jorma Taccone as Cha-ka, John Boylan as Enik, Matt Lauer as himself, and the Voice of Leonard Nimoy as the Zarn.I personally thought it was PERFECTLY cast, especially Jorma as Cha-ka who really steals this movie with his facial expressions, bleats of sound, and body movements. Its got to be hard to play a monkey person who has its own language and must convey SO MUCH in a performance without using the english language!Its a PG-13 movie, so not for little kids despite the tameness of the original tv series. It has sexual references, adult humor and situations, but its not too much for a 13 year old to handle if they are mature enough. parents who freak out that a movie is too ""adult"" usually have kids that are way immature for their age.Its a simple plot,a scientist finds a way to tear through time and space to a different dimension, he and some pals get lost there, and have to find a way back. There are bad guys who want to use the scientists device for evil, and there are harrowing events that seem to land in the laps of our heroes that might prevent them from getting back home and saving the universe!All the elements from the TV series are here, but they have built on them to make them even better looking, and in my opinion , hilarious.  Are the effects mindblowing? No, do they work? Yes. My stomach hurt from laughing so hard, and i didnt go in expecting to love this so much. Will Farrell as of late hasnt been doing much but being ""Will Farrell"" in films, but with the cast he has to work with like Danny and Anna and Jorma his humor gets a boost in the right direction.",4,"Loved it, would see it again.",1256169600,"10 22, 2009",2009,2157,"['grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Land', 'Lost', 'had', 'entire', 'theme', 'song', 'memorized', 'was', 'super', 'low', 'budget', 'written', 'bunch', 'renowned', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'writers', 'Larry', 'NivenDestroyer', 'Worlds', 'Ben', 'BovaThe', 'Immortality', 'Factor', 'even', 'Star', 'Trek', 'actor', 'Walter', 'Koenig', 'main', 'writers', 'course', 'were', 'Sid', 'Marty', 'Krofft', 'who', 'worked', 'theatrical', 'release', 'as', 'well', 'side', 'Chris', 'Henchy', 'who', 'Entourage', 'Eastbound', 'Down.Land', 'Lost', 'stars', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Dr.', 'Rick', 'Marshall', 'Anna', 'Friel', 'Holly', 'Cantrell', 'Danny', 'Mcbride', 'Will', 'Stanton', 'Jorma', 'Taccone', 'Cha-ka', 'John', 'Boylan', 'Enik', 'Matt', 'Lauer', 'Voice', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'Zarn.I', 'personally', 'thought', 'was', 'PERFECTLY', 'cast', 'especially', 'Jorma', 'Cha-ka', 'who', 'really', 'movie', 'facial', 'expressions', 'bleats', 'sound', 'body', 'movements', 'got', 'be', 'hard', 'play', 'monkey', 'person', 'who', 'own', 'language', 'must', 'convey', 'SO', 'MUCH', 'performance', 'using', 'english', 'language', 'PG-13', 'movie', 'so', 'not', 'little', 'kids', 'tameness', 'original', 'tv', 'series', 'sexual', 'references', 'adult', 'humor', 'situations', 'not', 'too', 'much', '13', 'year', 'old', 'handle', 'are', 'mature', 'enough', 'parents', 'who', 'freak', 'out', 'movie', 'too', 'adult', 'usually', 'have', 'kids', 'are', 'way', 'immature', 'age.Its', 'simple', 'plot', 'scientist', 'way', 'tear', 'time', 'space', 'different', 'dimension', 'pals', 'get', 'lost', 'there', 'have', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'are', 'bad', 'guys', 'who', 'want', 'use', 'scientists', 'device', 'evil', 'are', 'harrowing', 'events', 'seem', 'land', 'laps', 'heroes', 'might', 'prevent', 'getting', 'back', 'home', 'saving', 'universe', 'elements', 'TV', 'series', 'are', 'here', 'have', 'built', 'make', 'even', 'better', 'looking', 'opinion', 'hilarious', 'Are', 'effects', 'mindblowing', 'No', 'do', 'work', 'Yes', 'stomach', 'hurt', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'i', 'didnt', 'go', 'expecting', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'Will', 'Farrell', 'late', 'hasnt', 'been', 'doing', 'much', 'being', 'Will', 'Farrell', 'films', 'cast', 'work', 'like', 'Danny', 'Anna', 'Jorma', 'humor', 'boost', 'right', 'direction']",N/A
1270343,A4ZQZP41D95JO,B002IKIHE6,Chad Varnadore,"[1, 2]","I enjoyed this film more than I thought I would and more than it probably deserved.  The excessive innuendo and language prevents it from being the great family vehicle (ala Scooby Doo) that it could have/should have been.  The circumstances and performances are overtly silly, which is really what's fun and funny about it.  But the excessively crude and juvenile jokes demean the merits of the entire project.  I really think the screenwriters missed thier audience with this one.  I know my 6 year old nephew was heartbroken when he saw the BD sitting on the shelf and found out that he couldn't watch it.  He loves anything with dinosaurs.  And, essentially, the film plays exactly like the live-action Scooby Doo movies - silly, action-packed, and fun for forgiving and/or nostalgic eyes.  The action jokes are often hilarious.  Where the story misses its mark is with the verbal laughs.  The screenplay is far too crude, mean, and vulgar for younger audiences, those that have parents that actually monitor what they can watch anyway.  Rather it seems mostly appealing to a teenage mentality that laughs at anything as long as a four-letter-word is involved or a little sexual aspersion.  But, I think that those same teens that might laugh at the crassness of the humor, would probably cringe at the films elementary premise.  This seems like one of those rare times, when the studio possibly should have stepped in and said, ""Hey!  What are you thinking?!!""It's too bad they didn't use Blu-rays massive storage capacity to implement a kid-friendly version on the disc.  It would have been so easy to substitute most, if not all of the offending material with something less offesive.  Otherwise the Blu-ray is great.  It looks and sounds terrific, as expected.

1270344,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002IKIHE6,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 6]","There are some movies that genuinely work hard at being preposterous and looking phony, and ""Land of the Lost"" is definitely one of them. This movie is in fact so preposterous and phony that it's actually kind of fun. Consider the appearance of the dreaded Sleestaks, lizard-like creatures with big, bulbous eyes and lots of sharp teeth; I could tell that costume designer Mark Bridges was intentionally going for the cheesy 1950s B-movie look (the only thing missing was the zipper running down the front of the suit). Also consider the haphazard appearance of the locations; in this alternate dimension, it's apparently permissible for sprawling deserts, muggy swamps, and towering volcanoes to be so geographically close to one another. And only in such a place would bits and pieces of real architecture, such as motels and bridges, poke out of the sand like forgotten ruins. And to think this movie was given a $100,000,000 budget. I'm reminded of a Dolly Parton quote, given in reference to her trademark image: ""It takes a lot of money to look this cheap.""Where this movie goes wrong is in its tone. For a concept that's inherently family friendly, I was surprised at just how crude ""Land of the Lost"" turned out to be, with swearing and sexual innuendos pushing the boundaries of its PG-13 rating. I'm not saying that I'm against swearing and sexual innuendo--I'm saying that, for this particular story, it was stylistically out of place. While I wasn't yet born when the original Sid and Marty Krofft TV series was on the air, I understand that it was a Saturday morning event made for kids. Judging by the scenes breast-grabbing, the references to heavy narcotics, and the unsavory moment when Will Ferrell douses himself with dinosaur urine, it seems that writers Chris Henchy and Dennis McNicholas and director Brad Silberling wanted the feature film to appeal to immature eighteen year olds.The story: Ferrell plays Dr. Rick Marshall, who loses all credibility when Matt Lauer of NBC's ""Today"" trashes his theories on inter-dimensional portals. By reaching into another dimension, Marshall claims, we would be able to import all sorts of new fossil fuels, which in turn would solve our current energy crisis. Lauer, who says that Marshall's book can be found in the I'm Out of My Freakin' Mind department of a bookstore, is quick to point out that respected scientific minds like Stephen Hawking think this theory is utterly ridiculous. This interview goes so badly that Marshall is reduced to teaching science to apathetic children in a subpar classroom.Along comes Holly Cantrell (Anna Friel), a British scientist who was kicked out of Cambridge for believing that Marshall's theories have any merit. She convinces him to follow her to the desert, bringing with him a machine of his own design: A tachyon amplifier, which, for reasons too complicated and inconsequential to mention, is able to produce time warps. It also repeatedly plays the song ""I Hope I Get It"" from ""A Chorus Line,"" and again, it's for inconsequential reasons. In the desert, Marshall and Holly meet Will Stanton (Danny McBride), a clueless survivalist who runs a hopelessly fake tourist attraction called Devil's Cave, sort of a funhouse crossed with a badly navigated raft ride.When Marshall turns on his tachyon machine, the entire cave suddenly rumbles to life, sending our three heroes over an impossibly massive waterfall and into a swirling vortex, one that leads to a parallel dimension. They've officially arrived in the Land of the Lost, a bizarre world populated by super intelligent dinosaurs, mosquitoes that can drink 1,000 times their weight in human blood, and a sex-crazed half-monkey creature named Cha-Ka (Jorma Taccone), who quickly becomes their companion. In due time, it becomes a matter of life and death, the Sleestaks threatening to reign supreme as masters of the universe.It's amazing how selective I can be when suspension of disbelief is required. I was able to accept, for example, that Holly just happens to understand and speak Cha-Ka's language, which is really just a series of grunts mixed with prehistoric gobbledygook. I was also able to accept the appearance of a gigantic crab, which runs across the distant desert landscape before falling through a patch of thin sand into boiling water, which, apparently, is what flows underground. However, as Marshall, Stanton, and Cha-Ka chow down on cooked pieces of claw, I noticed they were spraying their food with a humongous wedge of lemon. I just sat there and wondered, ""Where did they find such a big lemon?"" There's not one scene that shows or even mentions the existence of extra large citrus groves.But that's not the real problem here. While ""Land of the Lost"" achieves much with its campy visuals and implausible plot, it doesn't get very far with its juvenile dialogue and sophomoric gags. It's as if the film were trying to be a parody of the TV series, which is ridiculous since the series was so badly made that it was essentially a parody to begin with. The end result is a disappointing film, something could have been a lot more fun if only it been a little more family-oriented. This obviously would not work for all films, and please believe me when I say that I wasn't hoping for a cutesy romp about jolly boys and girls. I just wanted a tamer film, something that spent less time on Cha-Ka's obsession with Holly's chest and more time keeping its tongue planted in its cheek. The costumes and sets can be wonderfully shabby, but you should never skimp on the quality of a screenplay.",3,Where Time Has No Meaning,1244246400,"06 6, 2009",2009,5574,"['are', 'movies',

And, remarkably, it's not all sex and fart jokes. This isn't a PG movie - obviously, Will Farrell is the star. But a lot of the jokes are just dry humor, rather than Old School-style comedy. I also found all the abuse Chakra took pretty hilarious. Danny McBride has some funny scenes too.I felt like one of the things preventing this from being a 5-star movie was the quality of the special effects. The parallel universe seems a bit empty. The dinosaurs aren't anatomically correct - even compared to Jurassic Park. The CG seems a cartoonish. The Tyrannosaur drags its tail close to the ground, an obviously inaccurate portrayal. I think the film was trying to go for a classic Land of the Lost: The Complete Series. However, as a natural history aficionado, it would have been nice if the dinosaurs looked more realistic.On the other hand, the Sleestaks look awesome. They have a retro look - they look like guys in lizard suits, but done really well.Overall, Land of the Lost is definitely worth checking out.

You could just tell that it would be crazy and well just plain fun. Thankfully I was aware that I should not go into this with high expectations [thanks Mr.KIA]. Thanks to the warning I believe that I was able to enjoy this more so than I would have. With that said this is not a classic but if you watch it with the brain off it is fun. Staring of course Will Ferrell, Anna Friel, Danny McBride, and Jorma Taccone the cast really helps this one out. Still fun will be had if you go in with no expectations and the brain off.Dr. Rick Marshall [Ferrell] is a crazy and weird minded guy, or so the science community believes. Years have gone by since they booted him from his life's work on time warps and such and reduced him to a school teacher. That is until Holly Cantrell [Friel] walks into his classroom and into his life. The thing about her is that she believes in not only his theories but also in him. After an eating binge takes place he finishes his tachyon amplifier or whatever it is and off they are to find a site where it will work. They find it at a seemingly abandoned tourist attraction. But in order to get to the part they need they must take a boat tour with their guide Will Stanton [McBride]. One thing leads to another and they end up in you guessed it, the land of the lost. It is here that they meet Cha-Ka [Taccone] and all the fun starts to happen. They learn that they are part of a bigger adventure then once thought, dinosaurs included.The film is far from perfect like the characters never seem to build up any before they are in the Lost Land, except maybe Will Stanton. But Holly in particular appears out of nowhere and the story immediately kicks off. That's another thing about this film, it just kinda starts but I guess that is part of the fun. The writers did a good enough job but it seemed like they didn't know which way they wanted to go with this. Still there is some good stuff in here and the director [as he says in the commentary] did include a lot of stuff from the series, see if you can find them all. So there are problems but there are some funny moments to be had, particularly the cast saves this one.Star Will Ferrell is actually perfect for this type of role and plays the dim witted yet somehow smart scientist with ease. In fact if anyone thinks any different I would say the writing for the characters is off more so than the actors. Anna Friel is good in her role as well and does a good job as the woman infatuated with the good Dr. still her character was rushed in but once again a writing error. While both of them are great in this film Danny McBride, and Jorma Taccone seem to be show stealers in this. Jorma is great as Cha-ka and is one of the more entertaining things about this film. Danny is absolutely hilarious at least to me in this movie and provides some of the best moments. Like when he posses for a picture when a giant T-Rex is about to eat them, or when he gives a big heartfelt speech about joining Rick in battle [you'll see]. I don't know but I found him hilarious in this, just me I guess.Like I said earlier this is not a perfect film and does have some problems but if you go in just wanting to have fun, you will. I was able to get the warning ahead of time [thanks again KIA] so I enjoyed it. I do recommend this film but go in with no expectations and not expecting the show to be duplicated. The film is fun and the performances are fun as well, I say check it out as a rental at least and see from there. Also this film was made for fans of the series who are grown now [at least the original viewers] so they should get the nice throwbacks to the original show.

I bought the second season of the series not long ago.  So I knew I had to see this.  And even though Will Ferrel is usually hit and miss with me (more often miss than hit), I thought this was the best thing he's done in a long time!  And really, it's kind of a clever spin/spoof on the original that does manage to generate a fair amount of interest even in terms of an adventure story.  It's great seeing how they come up with things that we know from the original.  The dinosaur was certainly fierce, well-done, and filled in nicely for Grumpy.  I thought the Zarn guy, Enic, could have been a little more convincing, a little closer to the original perhaps.  Finally, the story stayed true to the original not in it's comedy flavor, but just in how whacked out it was falling in and out of this dimension and that one - the original Land of the Lost is true sci-fi (albeit on low budget).  This one also managed to bring forth and add some new twists to the old ""routine expedition"" gone terribly awry. And terribly ridiculous as well. I think this movie was a great idea.PS I watched it twice - the second time with friends.  I liked it as much or better the second time.  Some really funny scenes and kind of a clever story as well.

1270377,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B002IKIHE6,Jason,"[3, 5]","Paleontologist Dr. Rick Marshall (Farrell) appears on the Today Show with Matt Lauer to defend his theory of parallel universe time-warp travel via tachyon amplification.  After being dismissed by Lauer as insane, and unwittingly turning himself into an internet phenomenon, Marshall drops the dream and ends up as a ridiculed science teacher.  Enter Holly Cantrell (Anna Friel), a British scientist who has sacrificed her education and career to follow in Marshall's footsteps.  Together the two make their way to a cheesy attraction called Devil's Cave to test the newly created device that will allow time warps.  Alongside tour guide Will Stanton (Danny McBride) - who turns out to be the quintessential firework-selling carnival worker - the group travel to a parallel universe where the fun begins.The group quickly meets up with Cha-Ka (Jorma Taccone), a missing-link of a beast who speaks in a jumbled prehistoric language.  Luckily for the group, Holly can translate as they go through the struggles of experiencing a new world with new dangers while looking for a way back to their own universe.For the most part, the movie consists of the silliness for which Farrell has become famous.  Taccone and McBride provide the comedic version of background singing, and Friel ends up being the straight man.  Through the brilliant eyes of the set designers, computer animators, talented special effects artists, and wonderful cinematography, the alternate universe is bizarre and replete with the absurd.  With the famous Sleestak as a background to the story, there is enough familiarity for fans of the original series.  For newcomers, however, there is a collection of the random that is sure to impress.  From missing planes, Vikings ships, motels buried in the desert sand, dinosaur urine showers, a globe-sized walnut, a T-Rex nicknamed Grumpy, and 100-lb. crab legs, it's a visual smorgasbord that is fairly entertaining.  I'd say it's stuck somewhere between a pre-teen target audience because of its overall feel and a more mature group that appreciates crude humor and veiled references to Sleestak sexuality.  The overall movie, however, is much like the narcotic fruit which produces a slightly humorous scene between the guys and Cha-Ka at a swimming pool; it hangs a bit low.",4,Being chased by a T-Rex has never been so fun,1246147200,"06 28, 2009",2009,2292,"['Paleontologist', 'Dr.', 'Rick', 'Marshall', 'Farrell', 'Today', 'Show', 'Matt', 'Lauer', 'defend', 'theory', 'parallel', 'universe', 'time-warp', 'travel', 'tachyon', 'amplification', 'being', 'dismissed', 'Lauer', 'insane', 'unwittingly', 'turning', 'internet', 'phenomenon', 'Marshall', 'dream', 'up', 'ridiculed', 'science', 'teacher', 'Enter', 'Holly', 'Cantrell', 'Anna', 'Friel', 'British', 'scientist', 'who', 'sacrificed', 'education', 'career', 'follow', 'Marshall', 'footsteps', 'Together', 'two', 'make', 'way', 'cheesy', 'attraction', 'called', 'Devil', 'Cave', 'test', 'newly', 'created', 'device', 'will', 'allow', 'time', 'warps', 'Alongside', 'tour', 'guide', 'Will', 'Stanton', 'Danny', 'McBride', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'quintessential', 'firework-selling', 'carnival', 'worker', 'group', 'travel', 'parallel', 'universe', 'where', 'fun', 'begins.The', 'group', 'quickly', 'up', 'Cha-Ka', 'Jorma', 'Taccone', 'missing-link', 'beast', 'who', 'jumbled', 'prehistoric', 'language', 'Luckily', 'group', 'Holly', 'can', 'translate', 'go', 'struggles', 'experiencing', 'new', 'world', 'new', 'dangers', 'looking', 'way', 'back', 'own', 'universe.For', 'most', 'part', 'movie', 'silliness', 'Farrell', 'become', 'famous', 'Taccone', 'McBride', 'provide', 'comedic', 'version', 'background', 'singing', 'Friel', 'up', 'being', 'straight', 'man', 'brilliant', 'eyes', 'set', 'designers', 'computer', 'animators', 'talented', 'special', 'effects', 'artists', 'wonderful', 'cinematography', 'alternate', 'universe', 'bizarre', 'replete', 'absurd', 'famous', 'Sleestak', 'background', 'story', 'enough', 'familiarity', 'fans', 'original', 'series', 'newcomers', 'however', 'collection', 'random', 'sure', 'impress', 'missing', 'planes', 'Vikings', 'ships', 'motels', 'buried', 'desert', 'sand', 'dinosaur', 'urine', 'showers', 'globe-sized', 'walnut', 'T-Rex', 'nicknamed', 'Grumpy', '100-lb', 'crab', 'legs', 'visual', 'smorgasbord', 'fairly', 'entertaining', ""'d"", 'say', 'stuck', 'somewhere', 'pre-teen', 'target', 'audience', 'overall', 'feel', 'more', 'mature', 'group', 'crude', 'humor', 'veiled', 'references', 'Sleestak', 'sexuality', 'overall', 'movie', 'however', 'much', 'narcotic', 'fruit', 'slightly', 'humorous', 'scene', 'guys', 'Cha-Ka', 'swimming', 'pool', 'bit', 'low']",N/A

So I don't follow the Hollyweird situations very closely.  But it is nice to see thatonce in a while they come up with something that is worth my time.  I thought this was a TV movie but I guess it was in the theaterssomewhere.

I'm not sure why it's the only summer movie next to Up that Roger Ebert actually liked though. It was funny but I don't think it was the only live action summer movie that was good. While Anna Friel (Pushing Daisies) can do better. I think she has a real future. Ferrell and McBribe were funny but I think she was the only one actually acting. Ferrell and McBribe basically gave one note performances while just throwing out funny lines. Friel is beautiful, has charm and she can act.I don't think a more serious version based on the show could have made a good movie. But Ferrell needs to stop making movies based on old shows. I mean, his Bewitched, already hacked the hell out of a pretty good show. While his version of Land of Lost was some fun, it was hardly the show. But I suppose it didn't need a young girl in pigtails lost in a mysterious world with her father and her brother like in the series. I suppose the plot could be about anyone getting lost there.It has dinosaurs, the ugly lizard creatures and their hairy almost human looking monkey friend. With Will Ferrell, of course all that is poked fun at. He doesn't even take being chased by a T-Rex seriously. So it was basically just made to make money, while making fun of the show.

But if you suddenly find yourself in the wrong theater, and this movie is on the screen, there are some laughs to be had.The re-imagined LAND OF THE LOST is a send up of the Sid and Marty Kroft kid's show by the same name. One of the cable channels recently did a LOTL marathon, and it reminded me just how bad the show was. So just about anything would be an improvement. Even this movie.The main characters in LAND OF THE LOST are Dr. Rick Marshall (Will Farrell), Holly Cantrell (Anna Friel), and Will Stanton (Danny McBride). My first and strongest criticism is the inclusion of McBride's character AT ALL. He is in most of the movie and provides the worst parts. The simple act of removing him and all of his lines would have gained the show another star, easy. Even though the show is PG-13, McBride's character says things like Anna will get wet if she's near him, pointing out that he doesn't mean with water; and later, when he finds a giant vibrating crystal, he suggests that she sit on top of it. His character provides the crude factor that some have called ""innuendo"" but there was nothing subtle - or funny - about it.There was also a much-too-long scene that people have suggested was an homage to Cheech and Chong. That's an insult to Cheech and Chong. Dave was definitely not there when they wrote that stuff. It wasn't very offensive, but it wasn't funny, either. Where's the editor when you need him?Now for the good stuff. There is chemistry between Farrell and Friel. She *works* both as his love interest and as his foil. The abusive relationship between Farrell and Cha-ka, the primitive monkey-man, was hilarious. The hands-down funniest part of the movie was Farrell's musings about how Bobby Flay might cook Cha-ka. There was also a running joke concerning A Chorus Line that had a very funny pay-off. And the Today Show interviews were reminiscent of Saturday Night Live's very funny Jeopardy skits.  Oh, and even our favorite Vulcan makes an appearance.In short, there was plenty that worked in LAND OF THE LOST, but it is really overshadowed by what was horrible. It makes me wonder how that happens. Who wrote the good stuff? Who wrote the dreck? Who decided how much of each would go in?

Loria,"[25, 30]","""Captain Kirk's nipples!""...and if that quote didn't tell you the new big budget big screen ""Land of the Lost"" film isn't exactly directed at the Saturday morning TV crowd... I fondly recall spending those mornings in the 70's with Will, Holly, Dr. Marshall and the Sleestak, so when I heard Will Ferrell would be taking the lead I was content in the knowledge that the campiness of the original Sid and Marty Kroft show would be preserved. As fate would have it this preservation extends even to the cheesy theme song which Ferrell nearly performs in one scene...this theme song pretty much covers the series and movie's premise...the aforementioned characters, on a ""less than""  routine expedition via an earthquake and a tachyon gadget (this part is new) end up in a parallel space they call the ""Land of the Lost"" complete with prehistoric critters and lizardmen. Unlike the series they need to find Dr. Marshall's misplaced gadget in order to get home, this leads to lots of mishaps and sight gags.  But as I mentioned, this is not your father's ""Land of the Lost""  this is a Will Ferrell, albeit watered down, but nonetheless, a Will Ferrell film, so as you'd expect there is overt crude references flying aplenty, including hot Sleestak-on-Sleestak action (not really on screen), nothing to cringe-worthy...although some drug and vague sexual jokes.""LOTL"" is bookended by a ""TODAY"" show sequence in which Matt himself interviews Dr. Marshall about is kooky space/time theories and then again later interviews a vindicated Dr. Marshall at the movie's end.  Dr. Marshall is classic Will Ferrell, the pompous, dimwitted boob he plays soooo well, so you know precisely what you will get upon entering the theater.

1270391,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B002IKIHE6,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[3, 3]","2009's ""Land of the Lost"" seems to be one of those films that you either love or hate.  Unfortunately for stars Will Ferrell, Anna Friel, and Danny McBride, the latter group appears to be in the majority.The film isn't so much of a big screen adaptation of the beloved childrens' series that shares its namesake.  Instead, it's more of a campy and comedic revisioning of the show.  While you'll recognize the names of Rick, Will, and Holly, you won't see them as you might remember.In this tale, Ferrell plays Dr. Rick Marshall, a washed-up scientist who is made out to be a buffoon by Matt Lauer (yep, THAT Matt Lauer) during an interview on the Today show when he attempts to explain that time-dimensional travel is possible.A few years later, we find Marshall teaching middle-schoolers and being ridiculed even more.  It's at this point that Holly Cantrell (Friel), a former grad student, shows up believing Marshall's theories to be true and possible to prove.  She convinces Marshall to complete the tachyon amplifier, a device that he believes will allow him to travel to other dimensions.Soon enough, the pair end up at a cave which appears to be the ideal spot for testing the amplifier.  Leading the group on the ""routine expedition"" is Will Stanton (McBride), a stoner tour guide who uses cheap tactics in an attempt to scare his guests on their journey.The tachyon amplifier begins to become active while traveling through the cave and soon the entire crew goes down a huge waterfall and end up in the Land of the Lost.  They save Cha-Ka (Jorma Taccone) from sure death and then set out to find a way home via the now-lost tachyon amplifier.  The group runs into Enik, a tunic-sporting Sleestak, who claims to be able to help them get home and also stop an evil Sleestak army from invading Earth.  Will Dr. Marshall, Will, and Holly be successful in their attempt to save mankind?  Does it realy matter in a film like this?  You'll have to either laugh your way through or look away in disgust for the rest of the film in order to find out.I won't say that this film is comedy gold.  It's not that by a long shot.  However, I must say that for folks who grew up on the original series, this film should be enjoyable.  Throughout the dialogue of the film, fans of the original series will be able to lace together almost the entire theme song.  Holly's clothing at one point and her hair throughout most of the group's time in the Land of the Lost call back memories of Kathy Coleman's innocent portrayal of Holly in the 1970's.  The Pakuni, Sleestak, and even Grumpy have key parts in the film.  In short, the film manages to give a bit of respect to the original series without ridiculing its  innocence.With that said, I must point out that although the original series was innocent and kid-friendly, it's big screen update certainly is not.  There is quite a bit of coarse language throughout the film, a number of adult themes and references, and even one particularly violent scene involving an ice cream truck.So why did I give ""Land of the Lost"" four stars?  For the simple fact that it is a humorous campfest that never tries to be more than what it really is:  an adult  spoof of a much-loved children's program.  Much like in ""Elf"" and ""Blades of Glory,"" Ferrell's humor is restrained a bit.  He doesn't become overly annoying.  Anna Friel is easy on the eyes and plays her love-interest role with comedic flair.  Danny McBride should be getting bigger roles by now.  He's much too funny to be standing in Ferrell's shadow.  If you haven't watched his HBO series, ""Eastbound and Down,"" I highly recommend it.""Land of the Lost"" isn't for everyone.  If you really enjoyed the old TV show and want to have a bit of fun with it as an adult, pick up this DVD.  If you're too serious to watch this film for what it is, don't even bother.  I recommend ""Land of the Lost"" to anyone who grew up in the 70's or early 80's and remember the original series this film is loosely based on.  Most Ferrell fans will probably enjoy this as well, but some of them might prefer Ferrell's more unrestrained antics in his other films more.",4,"Goofy, Trippy, And I Like It",1273536000,"05 11, 2010",2010,4139,"['2009', 'Land', 'Lost', 'be', 'one', 'films', 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'Unfortunately', 'stars', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Anna', 'Friel', 'Danny', 'McBride', 'latter', 'group', 'be', 'majority.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'big', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'beloved', 'childrens', 'series', 'shares', 'namesake', 'Instead', 'more', 'campy', 'comedic', 'revisioning', 'show', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'names', 'Rick', 'Will', 'Holly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'might', 'remember.In', 'tale', 'Ferrell', 'Dr.', 'Rick', 'Marshall', 'washed-up', 'scientist', 'who', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'buffoon', 'Matt', 'Lauer', 'yep', 'THAT', 'Matt', 'Lauer', 'interview', 'Today', 'show', 'when', 'explain', 'time-dimensional', 'travel', 'possible.A', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'find', 'Marshall', 'teaching', 'middle-schoolers', 'being', 'ridiculed', 'even', 'more', 'point', 'Holly', 'Cantrell', 'Friel', 'former', 'grad', 'student', 'up', 'believing', 'Marshall', 'theories', 'be', 'true', 'possible', 'prove', 'Marshall', 'complete', 'tachyon', 'amplifier', 'device', 'will', 'allow', 'travel', 'other', 'dimensions.Soon', 'enough', 'pair', 'end', 'up', 'cave', 'be', 'ideal', 'spot', 'testing', 'amplifier', 'Leading', 'group', 'routine', 'expedition', 'Will', 'Stanton', 'McBride', 'stoner', 'tour', 'guide', 'who', 'cheap', 'tactics', 'attempt', 'scare', 'guests', 'journey.The', 'tachyon', 'amplifier', 'become', 'active', 'traveling', 'cave', 'soon', 'entire', 'crew', 'down', 'huge', 'waterfall', 'end', 'up', 'Land', 'Lost', 'save', 'Cha-Ka', 'Jorma', 'Taccone', 'sure', 'death', 'then', 'set', 'out', 'find', 'way', 'home', 'now-lost', 'tachyon', 'amplifier', 'group', 'Enik', 'tunic-sporting', 'Sleestak', 'who', 'be', 'able', 'help', 'get', 'home', 'also', 'stop', 'evil', 'Sleestak', 'army', 'invading', 'Earth', 'Will', 'Dr.', 'Marshall', 'Will', 'Holly', 'be', 'successful', 'attempt', 'save', 'mankind', 'realy', 'matter', 'film', ""'ll"", 'have', 'way', 'look', 'away', 'disgust', 'rest', 'film', 'order', 'find', 'out.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', 'comedy', 'gold', 'not', 'that', 'long', 'shot', 'However', 'must', 'say', 'folks', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'original', 'series', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'dialogue', 'film', 'fans', 'original', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'lace', 'together', 'almost', 'entire', 'theme', 'song', 'Holly', 'clothing', 'one', 'point', 'hair', 'most', 'group', 'time', 'Land', 'Lost', 'call', 'back', 'memories', 'Kathy', 'Coleman', 'innocent', 'portrayal', 'Holly', '1970', 'Pakuni', 'Sleestak', 'even', 'Grumpy', 'have', 'key', 'parts', 'film', 'short', 'film', 'give', 'bit', 'respect', 'original', 'series', 'ridiculing', 'innocence.With', 'said', 'must', 'point', 'out', 'original', 'series', 'was', 'innocent', 'kid-friendly', 'big', 'screen', 'update', 'certainly', 'not', 'quite', 'bit', 'coarse', 'language', 'film', 'number', 'adult', 'themes', 'references', 'even', 'one', 'particularly', 'violent', 'scene', 'involving', 'ice', 'cream', 'truck.So', 'why', 'did', 'give', 'Land', 'Lost', 'four', 'stars', 'simple', 'fact', 'humorous', 'campfest', 'never', 'be', 'more', 'what', 'really', 'adult', 'spoof', 'much-loved', 'children', 'program', 'Much', 'Elf', 'Blades', 'Glory', 'Ferrell', 'humor', 'restrained', 'bit', ""n't"", 'become', 'overly', 'annoying', 'Anna', 'Friel', 'easy', 'eyes', 'love-interest', 'role', 'comedic', 'flair', 'Danny', 'McBride', 'should', 'be', 'getting', 'bigger', 'roles', 'now', 'much', 'too', 'funny', 'be', 'standing', 'Ferrell', 'shadow', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'HBO', 'series', 'Eastbound', 'Down', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Land', 'Lost', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'old', 'TV', 'show', 'want', 'have', 'bit', 'fun', 'adult', 'pick', 'up', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'too', 'serious', 'watch', 'film', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'recommend', 'Land', 'Lost', 'anyone', 'who', 'grew', 'up', '70', 'early', '80', 'remember', 'original', 'series', 'film', 'loosely', 'based', 'Most', 'Ferrell', 'fans', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well', 'might', 'prefer', 'Ferrell', 'more', 'unrestrained', 'antics', 'other', 'films', 'more']",N/A
1270392,A356RFKNIG043B,B002IKIHE6,K. Swanson,"[2, 2]","3.4 starsIt's a Will Ferrell movie, with Kenny Powers! That pretty much sums up LOTL, for better and for worse.(And if you don't know who Kenny Powers is, run don't walk to watch the first and so far only season of Eastbound And Down, one of the funniest tv comedies of the past decade. It blows this movie out of the water.)I expected to laugh less at this, in fact, but McBride and Ferrell have good chemistry and similar senses of humor that meld well, and they made me crack up quite a bit here. There are of course the requisite dumb laughs aplenty, but there are also some rather clever takes on modern culture and technology.It's only partly based on the old tv series, so don't expect much congruity. LOTL is played strictly for larfs, not suspense or romance (though those are here in small doses), and on that level it's a success. A self-mocking summer blockbuster, it has enough funny moments and groan-inducing gags to make it well worth watching for any fan of Will's or Danny's (though he really does seem to play Kenny in every role to a large degree, especially when he gets zonked on those weird plants here).I laughed more at this than I did at Step Brothers and a number of other recent Ferrell efforts, and it's much better than The Goods and other recent hopeless farces.

1270396,A3GXPVF1WGCZMK,B002IKIHE6,"Matt Harnick ""Discworld Junkie""","[1, 3]","To begin with, I am an old fan of the original Land of the Lost TV series. I am also not a fan of Will Farrell. Yet I was willing to give this thing a chance. I almost wish I hadn't. The best thing I can say about the film is that it was not as bad as the reviews led me to believe. The fact remains that it is still a terrible film in almost every way.The cheesiest thing in the film was how they worked the original lyrics of the opening theme into the script and then later had Will Farrell sing a terrible version of it as if to slam us over the head that this was supposed to be based on a beloved television series. The overly-intelligent dinosaurs were an insult to the intellect of the viewer. The story of the rivalry between Enik and the Zarn seemed artificially grafted into the film instead of being an integral part of it. Personally, I was miffed that they made Enik a megalomaniacal villain (he was originally a neutral character helping the Marshalls for his own selfish but understandable reasons) and the Zarn into the victimized guardian. In fact, they completely changed the nature of the Zarn altogether (originally he was a being made of colored lights who was sensitive to human thought and emotion and was more neutral than evil).The story runs that disgraced physicist Rick Marshall has invented a machine which can open a doorway in time and space. A grad student named Holly convinces him to to build it and they use it to open a portal to the land of the lost, inadvertently taking a tour-guide biker named Will along with them. Once in the Land of the Lost, they rescue Chaka, a Pakuni prince, from being sacrificed by userpers of his throne. Rick Marshall acts superior to everyone and everything in this place, which pisses off Grumpy, the genius T-rex who, for some reason, understands English. We also have no good explanation why working with Chimps has made Holly fluent in Chaka's language. After lots of bad jokes based on the original series, they find the Lost City of the Sleestak. They included the message scrawled on one of the rocks ""beware of Sleestak"" from the original TV show without explaining it properly. They have been led here psychically by Enik who is trapped inside. Enik tells them that his people's mortal enemy, the Zarn, is planning a Sleestak invasion of Earth. Rick must find his device which was lost when they entered the Land of the Lost in order to defeat the Zarn and get home again. It just goes downhill from here. The film ends with Rick Marshall and Holly falling in  love, Rick Marshall making friends with Grumpy, the T-rex (Grumpy was grumpy because of an intestinal blockage. Don't ask how it gets fixed), and Will remaining behind with Chaka and his people. And the invasion, which is really being planned by Enik, is stopped.What really gets me is that the original television series has a number of episodes which could have been strung together and, with a bit of tweaking, become a nice two-hour film: The Marshall family is vacationing in the Grand Canyon when an earthquake accidentally opens a time doorway to the Land of the Lost. They make friends with Chaka who helps them get through the first few weeks of their exile. They discover the Pylons and the Lost City teeming with Sleestaks - and mabe have a run-in with Captain Colli and his canon, Sarah. Deep inside the Lost City they find Enik in his secure cave. He agrees to help them, but it is a trick. By falling into the Land of the Lost, they have caused a paradox. They go through the doorway, fixing the paradox and fall back into the Land of the Lost again. But all is not lost. Chaka takes Rick Marshall to see a special ritual performed by Ta, the Pakuni elder which opens a time dooway in one of the pylons. Rick Marshall steps inside, ignoring Chaka's attempts to stop him. Meanwhile, Holly and Will go out hunting for their dad only to be confronted by a ghostly image of Holly. The Ghost beckons them into a cave where they are forced to help alternate versions of themselves and their father who are stuck in a wall by completing a circuit of crystals in a matrix table. When the smoke clears, they find themselves outside with Chaka running to get them. They follow chaka to the Travelling Pylon just in time for the door to open and Rick Marshall to step out with the news that the pylon is their ticket home. Next morning, they get inside the pylon and the last part of the film includes a series of stops on alternate worlds and times. Finally, they climb out of the pylon in a remote part of the Grand Canyon. An old, wreck of a car leads them to believe that they are in the wrong place until around a corner comes a troup of tourists on the backs of donkeys. I would maybe include Mrs. Rick Marshall as well as a female guide for Will to ogle.The point is that this film should have been a reverent, serious sci-fi epic rather than a cheesy satire which puts down the original source material every chance it could get.Bottom line, I would not recommend this film to anyone. Especially if you are a fan of the original series.

These two actors are the film's saving grace.The bad: The sets are both modern and retro.  Some special effects are great, while others look like they were stolen from the original TV series.  I'm sure the campiness is deliberate, but it just feels weird when combined with more modern special effects.The ugly: The film can't make up its mind.  It's like they wanted to make a film that attracted adults but was still suitable for kids.  The result is that they ended up somewhere in the middle - too much adult language and jokes to make it appropriate for kids, yet not enough substance to appeal to teens and adults.The film ultimately fails because it tried to make a modern adult version of an old kids show, and it was a half-hearted attempt.

If taken on it's own this is a good rather campy comedy that is tongue in cheek fun if you remember the old series you may not be happy with this movie. I think they decided to go with a comedy with pee jokes etc because the old show is from a different era effects wise and it was a kids show to boot. Perhaps they should have done a drama version but they chose not to and Will Ferrel is a good choice as lead actor in this comedy. Everyone in it does a good job in this comedy version that is not mocking the old show and for that fact alone I give this one four stars. The blu ray looks great and this has deleted scenes and other great extras. It is good enough to watch with your kids and laugh along with them too.

Tresca ""Talien""","[2, 3]","Right around the turn of the century it became very fashionable to mine the nostalgia of the latest crop of people who are now adults with paying jobs - Gen X, basically. The truth is that many of the pop culture artifacts that have seeped into our consciousness earned their place not by being very good but by being very repetitive. There are many, many shows I watched not because I was interested in them but because you couldn't swing a television remote without catching Happy Days, The Brady Bunch, The Love Boat, Fantasy Island, etc. If you were a kid on a Saturday morning, this meant you couldn't avoid Land of the Lost.Land of the Lost was never very good, but it didn't matter to me: It was the only way I was going to see monsters on television. Back then, any monster special effects were relegated to the big screen, and since I wasn't allowed to see most movies that featured them Land of the Lost was the only way I was going to see dinosaurs - even if they were poorly animated puppets or claymation. So you better believe I watched every bizarre episode I could, even if it never made any sense, the acting was frequently terrible, and the sets, costumes, and actors looked like they were made of rubber.Producers who decide to update these nostalgia icons have a choice: revamp the terrible show with utter seriousness (think ""Lost in Space"") or shamelessly mock it instead. ""Land of the Lost"" chooses to mock its source material.The problem is that it's not a loving mockery made by fans. It's clear the producers didn't do their homework. Oh they got some things right - they mimic the look-and-feel of the Sleestaks, of Cha-Ka, and Grumpy the dinosaur (sans claymation). But the innocent wonder is replaced with a smarmy, cynical approach that makes Will Ferrell out to be kind of a jerk.The three main characters are paleontologist Rick Marshall (Ferrell), student Holly Cantrell (Anna Friel, sporting a variety of tight t-shirts), and randomly inserted gift shop owner and foil to Marshall, Will Stanton (Danny McBride). They fall through a wormhole, they have to get back, Sleestaks, dinosaurs, yadda-yadda, the end. Marshall's rivalry with Matt Lauer (as himself) over the existence of time warps is the funniest thing about the film.Ferrell, who pretty much plays the same character in whatever movie he's in, doesn't have a warm cast to temper his antics. Instead he goes through a series of contrived set-ups with a punch line that ends in dinosaur excrement. This joke is used no less than three times. Scriptwriter Chris Henchy needs to find some new material.And that's the thing. If you're not familiar with the original TV series, this is just another semi-amusing entry in Ferrell's oeuvre with dinosaurs thrown in. But the whole point of reimagining the series was to lure those fans back into the theater, and instead they ended up with a bunch of dino poop.",2,Dino poop,1340150400,"06 20, 2012",2012,2896,"['Right', 'turn', 'century', 'became', 'very', 'fashionable', 'mine', 'nostalgia', 'latest', 'crop', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'now', 'adults', 'paying', 'jobs', 'Gen', 'X', 'basically', 'truth', 'many', 'pop', 'culture', 'have', 'seeped', 'consciousness', 'earned', 'place', 'not', 'being', 'very', 'good', 'being', 'very', 'repetitive', 'are', 'many', 'many', 'shows', 'watched', 'not', 'was', 'interested', 'could', ""n't"", 'swing', 'television', 'remote', 'catching', 'Happy', 'Days', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'Love', 'Boat', 'Fantasy', 'Island', 'etc', 'were', 'kid', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'meant', 'could', ""n't"", 'avoid', 'Land', 'Lost.Land', 'Lost', 'was', 'never', 'very', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'was', 'only', 'way', 'was', 'going', 'see', 'monsters', 'television', 'Back', 'then', 'monster', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'relegated', 'big', 'screen', 'was', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'see', 'most', 'movies', 'featured', 'Land', 'Lost', 'was', 'only', 'way', 'was', 'going', 'see', 'dinosaurs', 'even', 'were', 'poorly', 'animated', 'puppets', 'claymation', 'better', 'believe', 'watched', 'bizarre', 'episode', 'could', 'even', 'never', 'made', 'sense', 'acting', 'was', 'frequently', 'terrible', 'sets', 'costumes', 'actors', 'looked', 'were', 'made', 'rubber.Producers', 'who', 'decide', 'update', 'nostalgia', 'icons', 'have', 'choice', 'revamp', 'terrible', 'show', 'utter', 'seriousness', 'think', 'Lost', 'Space', 'shamelessly', 'instead', 'Land', 'Lost', 'mock', 'source', 'material.The', 'problem', 'not', 'loving', 'mockery', 'made', 'fans', 'clear', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'homework', 'Oh', 'got', 'things', 'right', 'mimic', 'look-and-feel', 'Sleestaks', 'Cha-Ka', 'Grumpy', 'dinosaur', 'sans', 'claymation', 'innocent', 'wonder', 'replaced', 'smarmy', 'cynical', 'approach', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'be', 'kind', 'jerk.The', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'paleontologist', 'Rick', 'Marshall', 'Ferrell', 'student', 'Holly', 'Cantrell', 'Anna', 'Friel', 'sporting', 'variety', 'tight', 't-shirts', 'randomly', 'inserted', 'gift', 'shop', 'owner', 'foil', 'Marshall', 'Will', 'Stanton', 'Danny', 'McBride', 'fall', 'wormhole', 'have', 'get', 'back', 'Sleestaks', 'yadda-yadda', 'end', 'Marshall', 'rivalry', 'Matt', 'Lauer', 'existence', 'time', 'warps', 'funniest', 'thing', 'film.Ferrell', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'character', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'warm', 'cast', 'temper', 'antics', 'Instead', 'series', 'contrived', 'set-ups', 'punch', 'line', 'dinosaur', 'excrement', 'joke', 'used', 'no', 'less', 'three', 'times', 'Scriptwriter', 'Chris', 'Henchy', 'find', 'new', 'material.And', 'thing', ""'re"", 'not', 'familiar', 'original', 'TV', 'series', 'just', 'semi-amusing', 'entry', 'Ferrell', 'oeuvre', 'dinosaurs', 'thrown', 'whole', 'point', 'reimagining', 'series', 'was', 'lure', 'fans', 'back', 'theater', 'instead', 'ended', 'up', 'bunch', 'dino', 'poop']",N/A

Together, they follow Marshall's tachyon amplifier invention to a roadside tourist trap in the desert that proves to hide a vortex to a parallel world: the Land of the Lost! Along with the tourist trap proprietor, redneck rebel Will Stanton, Marshall and Holly travel to the mysterious land where they encounter a T-Rex named Grumpy, a plethora of vicious lizard-men called Sleestaks, and a monkey-man named Cha-Ka who joins their little group. The explorers, fascinated at first, soon find themselves frequently running for their lives while questing to recover Marshall's invention and save a Sleestak leader and his people. It's constantly bizarre, but very hilarious and loads of fun!""Land of the Lost"" is unquestionably for fans of Will Ferrell. If you don't like him, you're not going to like this film. It's great for fans of the old TV show if you can handle the re-imagining of the human characters (all the other elements are there), but Will Ferrell haters just aren't going to like this (why some Ferrell fans don't like it, I cannot imagine)! It helps if you're a Danny McBride and Anna Friel fan too (in fact, McBride particularly shines in this film). It's all about this misfit trio and the wacky situations and creatures that inhabit the Land of the Lost. The effects are excellent and so is everything else. Yes, it's loaded with ""adult humor"", as one should expect from the cast, but it's consistently very funny and doesn't feel like it's retreading old ground in neither the dinosaur film department nor the adult humor department. I suppose, at the heart of the issue that made this film a flop is that A: A lot of moviegoers didn't watch the old show, and B: most of those who did wanted the film to have the same tone and take on the characters.

While that old show is great for the little ones (check out the Rhino DVD re-issues of that series) this movie is great for older fans like me or folks not familiar with the source material (too much groping and F-bombs for younger fans).  Its all of PG-13 and then some.  Here are some top reasons to check it out: Its produced by Sid & Marty Kroft and includes a great interview with both Sid & Marty; The intro & exit segments with Matt Lauer are great; The 2 clownish men-children & 1 straight woman format worked well; The CGI dinosaurs are rendered very nicely; Not too much CGI; The sets and natural locations are really nice; the old show's banjo makes a great cameo; both lead actors have some great riffing scenes I especially loved the ""Latin Grammys"" and neon-Motel in the desert bits; nice shout outs to Ray Harryhausen, Planet of the Apes, & Star Trek; bringing in Leonard Nimoy to add voice work was great as the old kids' show retained original Trek talent on writing duties (including Trek actor Walter Koenig who wrote for the 70s production); the old shows' Sleestaks, Pylons, and Library of Skulls are all there; Grumpy gets top billing and Will Ferrell gets to do a Fred Flintstone bit.

They had a huge bin of previously viewed DVDs and Blu Ray discs. This one was all of $2 so I figured why not. To be honest, I'd heard bad things about the movie, but at $2 I didn't think it was too much to ask. I'm not a huge fan of Will Ferrell movies, although his George W Bush special on HBO was very good. My advice here is unless you are not yourself or medically driven to laughing, avoid this film.The comedy was contrived just as the plot was. Nothing about the film felt natural or witty. I found myself grimacing more than anything and when I wasn't doing that, I was wondering why I was still watching it. I have read reviews here that say I need to open my mind and just enjoy the movie. I tried. I really did, but it was just so bad I couldn't help but shake my head at it. I honestly cannot think of any single part that I found to be even somewhat amusing. When they started to talk about science, I was thinking it might not be so bad. I enjoy a movie that makes you think and when they started getting into it, I thought there was some hope. Sadly, they only threw the small splashes of science in just so they could try to explain how the characters got to the land of the lost. In the end, it simply wasn't enough to keep me interested.I know the film was meant to be goofy, but even the goofs felt awkward and forced. I just kept thinking to myself ""is that supposed to be funny?"" If you feel compelled to give this movie a try, do so at your own risk. I will probably just end up giving this disc to my sister's kids.

Right now it seems that Hollywood is convinced that you are someone special. I swear to God I can't ESCAPE the Will Ferrell UNIVERSE or I WOULD. Recently I bought a tv series of cartoons called the Oblongs. Will Ferrell was the voice of Bob Oblong. I'm just going to say that Will Ferrell's talents are average and somewhat pedestrian and I wish Ferrell could have been confined to SNL. I mean SNL was weak enough with or without the Will's comedic offerings.Anyway, the movie surprisingly has a plot. The plot is something a fan of the show could have come up with. The creative mind that brought us this movie could be found in many high school kids. My problem with this movie is Ferrell's character. Ferrell plays a snobby but brilliant eccentric scientist who is also addicted to food binges, to putting his hand in his pants, to self pity, etc. Sometimes it seems like they made this movie up as they went along. I probably like the new Chaka better than the annoying original. I wish I could have seen more scenes with chaka singing. And the owner of the store, is there a real store and is that guy a real actor? Also, the female in the movie is barely attractive and WHY does she fall in love with Ferrell? Oh yeah, he's the ""brilliant"" scientist who used his boombox thingy to travel through a rift in time, yada, yada, yada.It seems in this Land of the Lost that Pakunis are pretty easy to understand and that also goes for the very intelligent T-Rex.I have to admit to enjoying the bit with Ferrell pouring dinosaur urine all over himself. And I love the line where the guy yells ""Do you ever get tire of being WRONG?""Mostly this movie is STEEPED in RETARDED and ASSININE moments. Most TRUE fans of the original show NEVER wanted the show to be remade as a movie COMEDY. And how many more RETARDED and ASSININE WIll Ferrell movies NEED to be MADE anyway? My God, I get it, Ferrell is the master of this dumbass genre.And why did Enik look so DORKY? I actually enjoyed Enik going EVIL. I enjoyed the ZARN being in the movie, but the original Zarn was NOT a Sleestak. I LIKE the new Pylons. The NEW cave Sucked though. And WHY couldn't the three adventurers have been a FAMILY UNIT?The movie is over the top ASSININE Comedy, a new GENRE of sorts, NO THANKS to WIll Ferrell.Ferrell and the creators of this movie were really only trying to MAKE A BUCK by jerking out this bomb of a movie. I mean there were many people like ME who LOVED Land of the Lost as a CHILD, so why tread so heavily on such a sweet childhood memory? The reason Ferrell and movie producers tread so HEAVILY over existing IDEAS is because they SIMPLY HAVE NO ORIGINAL IDEAS of their own. They also LACK the CHARACTER, DEPTH and SENSITIVITY of the original creators and writers and actors. At least some real INSPIRATION in much of what went into the FIRST TWO SEASONS of the show. Sadly, by the third season everyone had sold out.In this movie bomb the franchise cashed their chips in yet again.Cha Ching.So when is Will Ferrell going to play Gilligan???? The Skipper thought Gilligan was unbearable at times. If only he had to endure Ferrell's comedy. :(Despite my negative review of the movie I still hope to add this movie to my collection. I still like seeing the sleestak and so on being resurrected. This is a truely poor movie, but it is also the only new adventure in the Land of the Lost.

There's a great earthquake (great as the world has ever known) and they end up in the Land of the Lost, complete with a T-Rex and some Sleesaks and Chaka, who has a thing for Holly Cantrell's breasts.  Keep your hands off!Will pouring dinosaur urine on your body make you blend in with the dinosaur crowd?  Find out here!  Can you get stoned at a hotel pool and want to French your monkey?  Find out here!Notable notes:  When Dr. Marshall plays his song on a banjo in apology (long story) it's actually the lyrics of the original 70s show.  Of course in the original show Holly is a little girl so I guess there are some compensations.The movie is so bad, it's good.  Obviously the actors are not scared or even concerned about a T-Rex breathing down their necks.

Sorry... it's not funny, it's not scary, it's a very poorly made movie. In one of the behind the scenes extras, Danny McBride made a comment about one of the scenes as ""feeling a little flat"". He knew.Fact #3: The reviewer below who let his 5 and 9 year-old watch this movie should have his kids taken away by Child Protection Services.Fact #3: This is NOT a movie adaptation of the classic and beloved TV series from the 1970's. The LOTL theme presented here is merely a zany vehicle for Will Farrell to do his usual ""shtick"". The same as back in his SNL days only without actually being funny.Fact #4: This director sucks... the script sucks... Syd and Marty Kroft should be holding their heads in shame for defacing their own legacy. However, the CGI effects are pretty decent and Chaka amd the T-Rex is the most entertaining character in the film (niether are human) so it is truly a shame that this production wasn't taken more seriously. Just because a movie has dinosaurs or monsters in it doesn't mean that the acting and screenplay has to be sub-standard. In the end, you just get a lousy movie. Even the great Steven Spielberg is guilty of this heinous crime.Fact #5: Universal should be indicted for perverting this classic sci-fi TV series. Those of us who grew up with the TV show know that despite its low-budget cheesiness, it expanded our imaginations and was way better than the crap kids have to watch today - ultra-violent video games and mind-numbing cartoons.

But, Universal tried to make up for it here with a packed Blu catered to both the old series fans and Will Ferrell/Danny McBride followers.I will skip the content review as any competent review out there picks apart the million things wrong with this movie, so that leaves clarity, sound and supplements. The Blu clarity is as solid as can be from Universal, so with that comes the tons of shortcomings on the effects. Not your benchmark display test for an effects film; the stages come across fake, the green screen lines are prevalent but the dinos appear fairly realistic. The DTS gets TONS of usage so one can get some nice channel variances. The supplements are what give this 2 star film the extra bump.* 20:20 minutes of deleted scenes. For what this film became, most of these would have bored the kid audience and got cut; the first ten minutes are all character stuff with Ferrel's persona. The last few minutes would have been more closure on the love story angle. The McBride fans would only get one or two moments here of extra banter from him.* 11:00 minute Day in the Life of a movie star - Danny McBride. A camera crew follows him during a typical day at the set, including the usual fake banter between Ferrel and him, boring trailer tours, make-up sittings, etc.* 6:45 minute Devil's Canyon Tour. A great plug for the prop department as McBride takes you through all of the items in his store. More of the fake stuff between Ferrel/McBride on set.* 83 minutes making-of. Wow - was almost longer than the film. Covers every single aspect of production. Plenty of interviews, set pieces, set decoration, logistics, wardrobe - everything. Catered to the film-making crowd and buffs who like the looooong documentaries like this.* 23 minute Kroffts interview. A sit down with the both of them as they review everything about the original series and their associated works.* Director's commentary.* DBox enabled.I could not rate this higher (a five star) because of the poor content and listing of bad effects showing through on Blu. But the sound and volume of supplements (catering to a variety of followers) gives this entire package a good rating.

Liking the burly comic is a must to ensure enjoyment, and accepting quantum paleontology, parallel dimensions, time machines, temperamental dinosaurs, telepathic reptilian aliens, and show tunes sure helps.Heavily ridiculed for his unorthodox methods and outlandish theories, paleontologist Rick Marshall (Will Ferrell) is practically expelled from the scientific community after a disastrously embarrassing interview with Matt Lauer. All but giving up on his ideas of time travel and dimensional warps, Marshall's appetite for discovery is reinvigorated upon meeting enthusiastic colleague Holly Cantrell (Anna Friel), who has ardently followed his teachings. Completing the tachyon amplifying device that comprised the heart of his studies, Rick, Holly, and dimwitted tour guide Will Stanton (Danny McBride) are transported during a ""routine experiment"" to a prehistoric alternate dimension where dinosaurs, cavemen, and lizard people roam free.Very little remains faithful to the original TV show source material (the film does open with an appropriately old Universal logo) other than the extremely cheesy situations, trace character designs and fantasy themes - Land of the Lost may be produced by Sid and Marty Krofft, but it's entirely a Will Ferrell film. His brand of immature but innuendo-filled humor will likely offend parents, bore young adults, and go over the heads of children. The few worthy laughs are dependent on references and insinuations to mature content but are likely to be dismissed for the overbearingly common universe-conquering plot. It's a one-man show (although bawdy-comedy regular Danny McBride has a few spotlight moments) that isn't as daring as Ferrell's usual works and toned down for the PG-13 rating - sadly it's also not completely family-friendly.With contrived plot jargon like tachyon-harnessing, transdimensional energy, quantum-paleontology and self-induced food comas, the show is unfortunately more cowardly nonsensical than inspiringly visionary as Marshall himself is described. Urine gags and queasy jokes are present for the sake of an independent laugh rather than to build upon a cleverly derived sequence and always rely on crudeness. It doesn't help that everyone easily outruns the T-Rex (repeatedly), language barriers are introduced but practically ignored, and every dilemma or antagonist presents zero real threat (perils can safely be avoided by spontaneous singing and dancing). It's insincere, un-severe and unintelligent - at least Anna Friel strips down to short shorts and a revealing tank top a few minutes after arriving in the land of the lost.- The Massie Twins",2,Land of the Lost Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1244073600,"06 4, 2009",2009,2805,"['Certainly', 'odd', 'choice', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'vehicle', 'Land', 'Lost', 'loosely', 'based', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'kid', 'show', 'yet', 'out', 'raunchy', 'gross-out', 'adult', 'comedy', 'Liking', 'burly', 'comic', 'must', 'ensure', 'enjoyment', 'accepting', 'quantum', 'paleontology', 'parallel', 'dimensions', 'time', 'machines', 'temperamental', 'dinosaurs', 'telepathic', 'reptilian', 'aliens', 'show', 'tunes', 'sure', 'helps.Heavily', 'ridiculed', 'unorthodox', 'methods', 'outlandish', 'theories', 'paleontologist', 'Rick', 'Marshall', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'practically', 'expelled', 'scientific', 'community', 'disastrously', 'embarrassing', 'interview', 'Matt', 'Lauer', 'giving', 'up', 'ideas', 'time', 'travel', 'dimensional', 'warps', 'Marshall', 'appetite', 'discovery', 'reinvigorated', 'meeting', 'enthusiastic', 'colleague', 'Holly', 'Cantrell', 'Anna', 'Friel', 'who', 'ardently', 'followed', 'teachings', 'Completing', 'tachyon', 'amplifying', 'device', 'comprised', 'heart', 'studies', 'Rick', 'Holly', 'dimwitted', 'tour', 'guide', 'Will', 'Stanton', 'Danny', 'McBride', 'are', 'transported', 'routine', 'experiment', 'prehistoric', 'alternate', 'dimension', 'where', 'dinosaurs', 'cavemen', 'lizard', 'people', 'roam', 'free.Very', 'little', 'faithful', 'original', 'TV', 'show', 'source', 'material', 'film', 'open', 'appropriately', 'old', 'Universal', 'logo', 'other', 'extremely', 'cheesy', 'situations', 'trace', 'character', 'designs', 'fantasy', 'themes', 'Land', 'Lost', 'may', 'be', 'produced', 'Sid', 'Marty', 'Krofft', 'entirely', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'film', 'brand', 'immature', 'innuendo-filled', 'humor', 'will', 'likely', 'offend', 'parents', 'bore', 'young', 'adults', 'go', 'heads', 'children', 'few', 'worthy', 'laughs', 'are', 'dependent', 'references', 'insinuations', 'mature', 'content', 'are', 'likely', 'be', 'dismissed', 'overbearingly', 'common', 'universe-conquering', 'plot', 'one-man', 'show', 'bawdy-comedy', 'regular', 'Danny', 'McBride', 'few', 'spotlight', 'moments', ""n't"", 'as', 'daring', 'Ferrell', 'usual', 'works', 'toned', 'down', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'sadly', 'also', 'not', 'completely', 'family-friendly.With', 'contrived', 'plot', 'jargon', 'tachyon-harnessing', 'transdimensional', 'energy', 'quantum-paleontology', 'self-induced', 'food', 'comas', 'show', 'unfortunately', 'more', 'cowardly', 'nonsensical', 'inspiringly', 'visionary', 'Marshall', 'described', 'Urine', 'gags', 'queasy', 'jokes', 'are', 'present', 'sake', 'independent', 'laugh', 'rather', 'build', 'cleverly', 'derived', 'sequence', 'always', 'rely', 'crudeness', ""n't"", 'help', 'everyone', 'easily', 'T-Rex', 'repeatedly', 'language', 'barriers', 'are', 'introduced', 'practically', 'ignored', 'dilemma', 'antagonist', 'presents', 'zero', 'real', 'threat', 'perils', 'can', 'safely', 'be', 'avoided', 'spontaneous', 'singing', 'dancing', 'insincere', 'un-severe', 'unintelligent', 'least', 'Anna', 'Friel', 'down', 'short', 'shorts', 'revealing', 'tank', 'top', 'few', 'minutes', 'arriving', 'land', 'lost.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",N/A

To return to their world, the three hapless travelers must retrieve the time-warp machine they lost on the way. In this (intentionally) strange alternate universe the trio save the life of a primate ""Chaka"" (Jorma Taccone), who befriend them and joins the party. They are in for some adventures like attacks from dinosaurs, before they encounter other weird creatures in this ""cosmic lost and space.""You may find the premise intriguing, but actually, the story of ""Land of the Lost,"" a remake of the 70s TV show, doesn't know where it is going. Like ""Lost in Space"" (1998), another TV show remake, the feature-film version has talented cast and reasonable special effects, but the film itself looks pointless. What does it really want to be? It is not a family picture as it contains some crude sexual jokes (not that I disagree with that). It seems more than one person gets killed (off-screen), but this is not an adventure film. Maybe this is a sci-fi film (you will hear the voice of Leonard Nimoy as The Zarn). Or maybe not.Perhaps the best way to describe ""Land of the Lost"" is it is a Will Ferrell film. ""Land of the Lost"" has scored seven Razzie nominations (that includes two of his), but actually I found the film is not that bad. Certainly same old stale jokes are rehashed in this sci-fi comedy action and director Brad Silberling adds nothing new to the hackneyed formula, but the film remains mildly entertaining thanks to the three actors who deliver the goods. As to ""Chaka,"" well, he is slightly less irritating than Jar Jar Binks. Just slightly.While ""The Land of the Lost"" is not a great film, ""it is not a total mess, either.

Surprisingly, this script was so POORLY written that even most of the crude humor was unfunny...And that's something that's pretty hard to screw up! Will Ferrell dousing himself with dinosaur urine after standing under a ""dino dong"" to collect it?!? Will daring Marshall and Chaka to ""french kiss""?!? Two sleestak guards having sex?!?

This is NOT a kids' Sat morning show movie. It's a disjointed, rambling, even confusing movie that all-too-often reverts back to crude toilet humor when the plot stalls...Which is basically every few minutes. If you have kids, you'll be telling them to cover their ears and close their eyes with some regularity, which I find particularly offensive given the fact that they're making a buck based on an old KIDS tv show.

I didn't see this in the theater and as a fan of the original and after hearing all the bad press this movie received I was tentative about viewing this movie. I would qualify myself as a moderate fan of Farell's work which has been real hit or miss for me.I actually would give this movie 3.5 stars. This movie is not for children which is sad because I think it could have been possible for this movie to have been made with humor that could have appealed to both young and old alike. There is almost an equal amount of laughs as there are stupid cringe worthy attempts at humor. I think one of the problems of this movie, other than the low brow humor which can get old at times, is that this movie is trying way too hard to be funny. With an almost constant barrage of jokes flying at you some will stick and some will not. I think if the makers of this film had thrown a lesser volume of jokes at as and also found a way to bring more warmth and charm to the story they would have made a better picture.Will Farrel is a bit toned down and the jokes that do work, such as his interactions with Matt Lauer, the T-Rex and Chaka, do work very well. The special effects are top notch with dinosaurs worthy of Jurassic Park quality. The plot itself is pretty simple which I think works well with the movie because it doesn't bog the viewer down with a complex plot to sift through.One criteria for me in rating a movie is did the movie keep me engaged to want to see it through to the end or did I want to just turn it off? This movie did keep me interested to see how it ends and resolves. So if you keep your expectations realistic, this is not Citizen Kane, and realize that this is an entertaining low brow comedy with great special effects then I think you may enjoy the movie.",3,"Better than i thought it would be.,",1256083200,"10 21, 2009",2009,1860,"['movie', 'really', 'bombed', 'Box', 'Office', 'also', 'received', 'many', 'bad', 'reviews', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'theater', 'fan', 'original', 'hearing', 'bad', 'press', 'movie', 'received', 'was', 'tentative', 'viewing', 'movie', 'would', 'qualify', 'moderate', 'fan', 'Farell', 'work', 'been', 'real', 'hit', 'miss', 'me.I', 'actually', 'would', 'give', 'movie', '3.5', 'stars', 'movie', 'not', 'children', 'sad', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'possible', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'humor', 'could', 'have', 'appealed', 'young', 'old', 'alike', 'almost', 'equal', 'amount', 'laughs', 'are', 'stupid', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'attempts', 'humor', 'think', 'one', 'problems', 'movie', 'other', 'low', 'brow', 'humor', 'can', 'get', 'old', 'times', 'movie', 'trying', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'funny', 'almost', 'constant', 'barrage', 'jokes', 'flying', 'will', 'stick', 'will', 'not', 'think', 'makers', 'film', 'had', 'thrown', 'lesser', 'volume', 'jokes', 'also', 'found', 'way', 'bring', 'more', 'warmth', 'charm', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'picture.Will', 'Farrel', 'bit', 'toned', 'down', 'jokes', 'do', 'work', 'such', 'interactions', 'Matt', 'Lauer', 'T-Rex', 'Chaka', 'do', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'dinosaurs', 'worthy', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'quality', 'plot', 'pretty', 'simple', 'think', 'works', 'well', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bog', 'viewer', 'down', 'complex', 'plot', 'sift', 'through.One', 'criteria', 'rating', 'movie', 'did', 'movie', 'keep', 'engaged', 'want', 'see', 'end', 'did', 'want', 'just', 'turn', 'off', 'movie', 'did', 'keep', 'interested', 'see', 'how', 'resolves', 'So', 'keep', 'expectations', 'realistic', 'not', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'realize', 'entertaining', 'low', 'brow', 'comedy', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'then', 'think', 'may', 'enjoy', 'movie']",N/A

Basically, it's so bad, it's good -- very tongue in cheek, yet it tells a real story.  Instead of a dad and kids, this is a crackpot scientist (Dr. Rick Marshal: Will Ferrel), his groupie (Holly Cantrel From Cambridge Who Thinks He's Brilliant: Anna Friel) and Will No-Last-Name (Danny McBride).  Dr. Ridiculous has invented a ""tacheon amplifier"" which moves its holder sideways in time, and thrusts Marshal, Will and Holly in their tiny raft into an all-mixed-up prehistoric world where the dynos and sleestacks you remember prey on anyone who falls through the portal -- which is located inside Will's made-up cave ride ""attraction!""  With what you're thinking during most B action movies spoken aloud, great period music inserted at strategic times and a Chaka who really speaks Pakumi, this flick is a blast from the past that's better than the original because the latter took itself way too seriously.  The blu-ray edition has LOADS of great extras, some of which you'll have to be connected to the internet to access and cool animated menus which are styled after the closing credits visuals.
