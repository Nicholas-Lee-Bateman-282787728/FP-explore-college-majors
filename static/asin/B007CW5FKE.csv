1529948,A2IS16K96YSFDV,B007CW5FKE,Eric Mayforth,"[5, 5]","The fifth and final season of the Discovery Channel series ""Storm Chasers"" was eventful for Reed Timmer, Sean Casey, Tim Samaras, and their chase teams.  The 2011 tornado season in the U.S. was the most devastating in recent decades, with hundreds of fatalities nationwide and extreme damage in Tuscaloosa and Joplin.Timmer's team saw perhaps the most violent tornado in the history of the series in Mississippi during the historic April outbreak in the Deep South.  The series shows the devastation wrought during those few days, and it was tragic.  The three teams also chased in Missouri, Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Nebraska, and Arkansas in Season 5.The teams put new innovations and equipment to work during this season, and hoped to collect scientific data that would enable meteorologists to understand tornadoes better and issue more timely warnings.  The sailing was not always smooth, though, as the teams faced equipment failure, the guesswork and frustration that comes with chasing tornadoes, and tensions and arguments between team members concerning chasing strategies.A bonus episode, ""Behind the Storms,"" shows how the series was produced.  The three teams had varying levels of success in 2011, and fans of the series wish the teams well in their future chasing endeavors.",5,The Final Season of a Great Series,1339113600,"06 8, 2012",2012,1288,"['fifth', 'final', 'season', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'series', 'Storm', 'Chasers', 'was', 'eventful', 'Reed', 'Timmer', 'Sean', 'Casey', 'Tim', 'Samaras', 'chase', 'teams', '2011', 'tornado', 'season', 'U.S.', 'was', 'most', 'devastating', 'recent', 'decades', 'hundreds', 'fatalities', 'nationwide', 'extreme', 'damage', 'Tuscaloosa', 'Joplin.Timmer', 'team', 'saw', 'perhaps', 'most', 'violent', 'tornado', 'history', 'series', 'Mississippi', 'historic', 'April', 'outbreak', 'Deep', 'South', 'series', 'devastation', 'wrought', 'few', 'days', 'was', 'tragic', 'three', 'teams', 'also', 'chased', 'Missouri', 'Oklahoma', 'Kansas', 'Texas', 'Nebraska', 'Arkansas', 'Season', '5.The', 'teams', 'put', 'new', 'innovations', 'equipment', 'work', 'season', 'hoped', 'collect', 'scientific', 'data', 'would', 'enable', 'meteorologists', 'understand', 'tornadoes', 'better', 'issue', 'more', 'timely', 'warnings', 'sailing', 'was', 'not', 'always', 'smooth', 'though', 'teams', 'faced', 'equipment', 'failure', 'guesswork', 'frustration', 'chasing', 'tornadoes', 'tensions', 'arguments', 'team', 'members', 'concerning', 'chasing', 'strategies.A', 'bonus', 'episode', 'Storms', 'how', 'series', 'was', 'produced', 'three', 'teams', 'had', 'varying', 'levels', 'success', '2011', 'fans', 'series', 'wish', 'teams', 'well', 'future', 'chasing', 'endeavors']",Storm Chasers Season 5

1529950,A2T0DIXULILRQR,B007CW5FKE,Kris128183,"[6, 6]","Storm Chasers Season 5 takes place during the 2011 Tornado season. It is unfortunately the final season of the show. This season once again follows the storm chasing teams led by Sean Casey, Reed Timmer and Tim Samaras as they navigate Tornado Alley in search of the most useful tornado data and the most extreme tornado footage as well. With 2011 being one of the most devastating Tornado Seasons, there is no shortage of action in season 5. Reed upgrades his Storm Chasing vehicle and has his usual clashes with his fellow teammates. Meanwhile, Sean starts filming tornadoes in 3D and in the final episode of the series, gets perhaps the best tornado footage I've ever seen. Season 4 eliminated the narrator during the episodes, while the chasers would narrate what happens. It made the show a bit cheesy and this is corrected in Season 5 with the return of a proper narrator. Perhaps the only complaint I have is the over use of sound effects in this season. Crashes of thunder follow every single flash of lightning and they all sound the same which makes the show seem like less of a documentary. Other than that this is a great ending to a fantastic series and I would reccomend that any Storm Chasers fan gets this final season.",4,The Final Season,1343606400,"07 30, 2012",2012,1235,"['Storm', 'Chasers', 'Season', '5', 'place', '2011', 'Tornado', 'season', 'unfortunately', 'final', 'season', 'show', 'season', 'once', 'again', 'storm', 'chasing', 'teams', 'led', 'Sean', 'Casey', 'Reed', 'Timmer', 'Tim', 'Samaras', 'navigate', 'Tornado', 'Alley', 'search', 'most', 'useful', 'tornado', 'data', 'most', 'extreme', 'tornado', 'footage', 'as', 'well', '2011', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'devastating', 'Tornado', 'Seasons', 'shortage', 'action', 'season', '5', 'Reed', 'Storm', 'Chasing', 'vehicle', 'usual', 'clashes', 'fellow', 'teammates', 'Meanwhile', 'Sean', 'filming', 'tornadoes', '3D', 'final', 'episode', 'series', 'perhaps', 'best', 'tornado', 'footage', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Season', '4', 'eliminated', 'narrator', 'episodes', 'chasers', 'would', 'narrate', 'what', 'made', 'show', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'corrected', 'Season', '5', 'return', 'proper', 'narrator', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'use', 'sound', 'effects', 'season', 'Crashes', 'thunder', 'follow', 'single', 'flash', 'lightning', 'sound', 'same', 'show', 'seem', 'less', 'documentary', 'Other', 'great', 'ending', 'fantastic', 'series', 'would', 'reccomend', 'Storm', 'Chasers', 'fan', 'final', 'season']",Storm Chasers Season 5
