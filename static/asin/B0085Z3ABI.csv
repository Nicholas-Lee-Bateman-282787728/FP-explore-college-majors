1546887,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B0085Z3ABI,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[1, 1]","""One in the Chamber"" is a reasonably good direct-to-video action-thriller that nonetheless disappoints for (1) being produced so shortly before/after its leading stars' most recent rare theatrical outings (Red Tailsfor Cuba Gooding,The Expendables 2for Dolph Lundgren) and for (2) being such an ultimately average outing by director William Kaufman, whoseSinners And Saintsbecame one of the few DTV flicks to generate mainstream interest. What we have here is an ordinary low-budget movie with some good parts that's nevertheless held back by some dissatisfyingly generic writing and a cinematic opportunity that's ultimately not capitalized on very well.The story: two assassins (Gooding and Lundgren) are pitted against each other in the middle of a Czech mob war.I haven't followed Cuba Gooding's career for a long time, but I don't think he belongs in the DTV market - he's an Oscar winner, for goodness sakes, and the only one Dolph has ever worked with. However, neither in theaters nor on DVD do I think he's a great action performer: he has neither the presence nor the intensity, which adds to the overall boring nature of the character he plays, here. The script brings no new material to the conflicted loner cutout he plays, down to the bible-quoting  dialogue he espouses. Of course, it could just be that he, along with everyone else in the movie, looks bland next to Dolph Lundgren, whose character is described in-movie as ""Frank Sinatra on steroids"" and for all the world feels like he could have jumped out of a Quentin Tarantino movie. Lundgren really has a ball with this role, and beyond him, no one's really worth a second look: Billy Murray (""EastEnders"") is sort of entertaining as Gooding's retainer, but everyone else - including Louis Mandylor (""Martial Law"") as a mafia lord - speaks with an indistinguishable European accent and is all the more boring for it.Action-wise, the movie does alright but overall could use more of it. Most of the thrills are supplied by gunfights, but because they include a cool little sniper shootout with Gooding, they're not totally bad. Dolph starts off his stay in the film by beating up a roomful of thugs in a decent brawl and then later takes on Gooding in the promised one-on-one fight. While suspension of disbelief doesn't quite cover the thought of the 5'10"" Cuba Gooding going head-to-head for any length of time with the 6'5"" Lundgren, their match is both fast-paced and brutal enough to be entertaining. It's a good enough outing for action choreographer Dian Hristov, but even though the film only runs 90 minutes, the fights doesn't really sustain the story, which expands to involve the relationship between Gooding's character and the daughter of a past victim (Claudia Bassols), but this ends up more creepy and uncomfortable than the writers probably planned.Overall, I'm glad that this one is on the high end of average, but I wish both Lundgren and Gooding wouldn't settle for merely average at this stage in their career. I suppose that given the director's track record, it may not be his fault either (I smell studio meddling), but it's still disappointing that this film came relatively close to being outright good being going the way of so many others.

It stars Dolph Lundgren, who's been making a nice go at a comeback in the Expendables flicks, he was also in Stash House and Small Apartments, two recent theatrical releases and his next Universal Soldier installment will be hitting multiplexes in November. Still the big Swede is more than comfortable in this sort of thing, in fact he gives the picture's best and most lively performance. As a seasoned hit man, a role he could have played in his sleep and may well have in the past, here he adds color and personality to the role by not playing his usual hard ass, he's still a bad ass, dressed in a Hawaiian t-shirt and a white fedora hat, Lundgren also gets to further development the sense of humor that he displayed Expendables 2, here looking like a tourist with a hair trigger.Alas, Cuba Gooding, Jr., though, is the  movie's primary star, also on something of a comeback after the truly terrible and inept WWII insult Red Tails. Gooding plays a burned out world weary assassin working in Eastern Europe, he finds himself in a plot that is overtly complicated and often very confusing, but anyway, he fails to complete his assignment so the mobsters that employed him bring in Lundgren to finish the job and finish Cuba.Gooding, I have always felt to be something of an overrated actor, he won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 1997, though I felt Kris Kristofferson should have nabbed it for Lone Star, but those memories have long since diminished. Gooding has settled into the DTD world with a long list of forgettable and more often than not unwatchable films, he lags far behind other DVD stars in quality movies. He also isn't a very good or believable action star, here he has some very awkwardly doubled martial arts fight scenes with Lundgren. Gooding plays the part all moody and broody, looking for a noir-ish existentialism, but comes across simply dull. In fact, Lundgren exhibits so much more flavor and charisma that it is much easier to root for him over Cuba, who isn't exactly up there with Stallone or Van Damme, Dolph's more successful on screen advisories.One in the Chamber is a passable, rather routine, but agreeable enough old school action flick. The production is slick looking, the low budget origins are kept from showing too much.

While the story doesn't completely hold together, it benefits from a harder edged tone, as the two stars provide some charisma and energy, in a kind of humdrum crime drama.Rival underworld gangs are battling over turf, and contract killer Ray Carver (Gooding) is hired by one group, to eliminate members of another gang.  After Carver switches sides, and turns on his former employers, they enlist notorious hitman Alexei ""the Wolf"" Andreev (Lundgren), to complete the job, and also eliminate the duplicitous Carver.Years previously, Carver apparently killed a man, as his young daughter looked on.  Now a young woman also living in Prague, Carver has taken an interest in Janice Knowles (Claudia Bassols), who becomes another pawn in the gang war.Cuba Gooding Jr. has had an interesting career.  Once thought by some to have the potential to go the way of a Denzel Washington, he now seems relegated to B grade movies.

What could have been an enjoyable and mindless B action movie ended up with a mediocre result, an OK B action that we know could have been much better.There is not much story to talk about here, and that is not exactly the problem with the film. Cuba Gooding Jr. is a Bible-quoting assassin Ray, an American in Eastern Europe taking orders from a British employer Leo (Billy Murray). Dolph Lundgren is a mysterious killer in Hawaiian shirt, who keeps a cute black dog. Obviously director William Kaufman (""Sinners and Saints"") doesn't take the film too seriously, and that's a good thing.The real problem is that the script keeps the two key characters apart in two separate stories for a considerable time. It takes too much time for the stars to confront each other, and when they finally share the same screen, it is brief and not much of a payoff. The plot itself is acceptable, but the action (mostly shoot-outs) is few and far between.
