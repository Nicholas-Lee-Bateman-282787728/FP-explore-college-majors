355010,A1PJ2G9K7VNOQX,6303082661,Frank &#34;the man&#34;,"[21, 23]","I was surprised when I received the Synergy Entertainment DVD of the Deep Six how bad the quality of the picture and sound were.  I have a VHS version which is clearer, brighter, and the sound very much better.  On the DVD version, I had to crank the sound up to the point where the system hummed and the sound was mostly muffled and indistinct.  This is actually a reasonably good film (notwithstanding its stupid plot in places) and for some reason Warner Brothers has turned over the release to Synergy Entertainment which made a pig's breakfast of it.  The picture was washed out and in general it looked like a VHS tape on slow speed of a TV version.....I was sadly disappointed and recommend no one buys the DVD until Warner Brs. comes to its senses and releases a better copy.  Originally released in 4:3 and not widescreen, you may want to locate a VHS copy, which was a Warner release.....infinitely better picture and sound qualtiy.  As far as the movie goes, Alan Ladd always seems to be carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders.  Made in 1958, when he was 45 (already you can see the effects of the booze and drugs on him), and just 6 years before he committed suicide, Ladd actually fit the role of the tormented ex-Quaker Lieutenant very well, although he was 20 years too old for a Navy Lieutenant.  Even the beautiful ex-Canadian Dianne Foster (15 years his junior) who plays his love interest has to put full throttles on to get a decent reaction out of Ladd, who seems to have his feet stuck in cement.  One of the goofiest roles in the movie is William Bendix as the Jewish?? Petty Officer ""Frenchy Shapiro"".  Bendix and Ladd were real life pals and Frenchy has faith that Ladd will see the sense of shedding his Quaker qualms and start fighting.  The film is generally well cast otherwise with Joey Bishop, James Whitmore, and Efrem Zimbalist.  My biggest reservation about the film, other than the creaky plot, is how hard Dianne Forster's character has to work to get a reaction out of Ladd. The rest of us poor pilgrims would row a rubber dinghy across the Pacific for her....But this is the real strength of Alan Ladd...he is so tortured in real life that he can't hide it from the screen.  It really came through in Shane and does so here in Deep Six.  Was there ever a sadder actor out there?  One final point...shortly after this film (and a failed suicide attempt) Ladd did everything in his power to land the role of Lawrence in Lawrence of Arabia....What was he thinking?",2,Very Poor DVD quality,1334966400,"04 21, 2012",2012,2510,"['was', 'surprised', 'when', 'received', 'Synergy', 'Entertainment', 'DVD', 'Deep', 'Six', 'how', 'bad', 'quality', 'picture', 'sound', 'were', 'have', 'VHS', 'version', 'clearer', 'brighter', 'sound', 'very', 'much', 'better', 'DVD', 'version', 'had', 'crank', 'sound', 'up', 'point', 'where', 'system', 'hummed', 'sound', 'was', 'mostly', 'muffled', 'indistinct', 'actually', 'reasonably', 'good', 'film', 'notwithstanding', 'stupid', 'plot', 'places', 'reason', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'turned', 'over', 'release', 'Synergy', 'Entertainment', 'made', 'pig', 'breakfast', 'picture', 'was', 'washed', 'out', 'general', 'looked', 'VHS', 'tape', 'slow', 'speed', 'TV', 'version', '..I', 'was', 'sadly', 'disappointed', 'recommend', 'one', 'DVD', 'Warner', 'Brs', 'senses', 'better', 'copy', 'Originally', 'released', '4:3', 'not', 'widescreen', 'may', 'want', 'locate', 'VHS', 'copy', 'was', 'Warner', 'release', '..infinitely', 'better', 'picture', 'sound', 'qualtiy', 'As', 'far', 'movie', 'Alan', 'Ladd', 'always', 'be', 'carrying', 'weight', 'world', 'shoulders', 'Made', '1958', 'when', 'was', '45', 'already', 'can', 'see', 'effects', 'booze', 'drugs', 'just', '6', 'years', 'committed', 'suicide', 'Ladd', 'actually', 'fit', 'role', 'tormented', 'ex-Quaker', 'Lieutenant', 'very', 'well', 'was', '20', 'years', 'too', 'old', 'Navy', 'Lieutenant', 'Even', 'beautiful', 'ex-Canadian', 'Dianne', 'Foster', '15', 'years', 'junior', 'who', 'love', 'interest', 'put', 'full', 'throttles', 'get', 'decent', 'reaction', 'Ladd', 'who', 'have', 'feet', 'stuck', 'cement', 'One', 'goofiest', 'roles', 'movie', 'William', 'Bendix', 'Jewish', 'Petty', 'Officer', 'Frenchy', 'Shapiro', 'Bendix', 'Ladd', 'were', 'real', 'life', 'pals', 'Frenchy', 'faith', 'Ladd', 'will', 'see', 'sense', 'shedding', 'Quaker', 'qualms', 'start', 'fighting', 'film', 'generally', 'well', 'cast', 'otherwise', 'Joey', 'Bishop', 'James', 'Whitmore', 'Efrem', 'Zimbalist', 'biggest', 'reservation', 'film', 'other', 'creaky', 'plot', 'how', 'hard', 'Dianne', 'Forster', 'character', 'work', 'get', 'reaction', 'Ladd', 'rest', 'poor', 'pilgrims', 'would', 'row', 'rubber', 'dinghy', 'Pacific', '.But', 'real', 'strength', 'Alan', 'Ladd', 'so', 'tortured', 'real', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hide', 'screen', 'really', 'came', 'Shane', 'so', 'here', 'Deep', 'Six', 'Was', 'there', 'ever', 'sadder', 'actor', 'there', 'One', 'final', 'point', 'shortly', 'film', 'failed', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'Ladd', 'did', 'everything', 'power', 'land', 'role', 'Lawrence', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'was', 'thinking']",Deep Six VHS

355022,A3L3XC3OPMXLA6,6303082661,SandyK,"[0, 0]","This was made as a movie to bring the girlfriend/wife with you, which some reviewers can't seem to understand, especially considering the age this movie was made in. The love story in the movie is there to keep the lady entertained in seeing her prince charming at war, and returning back to her, now the valiant hero.Meanwhile, this story is about an otherwise conscientiousness objector (Quaker) having to make a choice between believing in his faith or &#34;becoming his own man&#34;. It's typical of the day that the otherwise CO would be like Mr. Ladd, without getting too messy with religious beliefs. In the end he does prove his mettle, but not as some Rambo. The ending leaves Mr. Ladd with a duty to fulfill, despite his future wife's bliss, so it's a tad bittersweet.There's some funny moments in the movie, and like many buddy movies while at war, there's some rowdy lower deck interaction (especially the fight scene with the merchant marine!) ... and for a good cause.Like the maturity level of the movie, a refreshing change of the sheer pornographic nature of modern films (and certainly not something to take the girlfriend/wife to watch). Nice balance between Mr. Ladd's star power as a leading man, and a man's need to watch a manly man's war movie, too.DVD quality, as mentioned with others, is indeed rather poor (almost a straight transfer, complete with all the film imperfections). So a person who's really into DVD quality will need to wait for a better transfer, especially to clean up the noise and adjust the chroma and color balance (film is showing that reddish darkroom tone, too).4 Stars due to the really poor video quality (YouTube videos have higher video quality). Except for some rather cheesy acting here and there with the crew, the overall acting quality and content is a nice mixture of love, humor, action and thinking time (especially scenes where Mr. Ladd has to decide between faith and principles). It's what you'd expect of a 1958 movie (although asking his girlfriend if she wanted a martini in front of his traditional Quaker mom, was stretching the moral aspect of the day, even for 1958 social mores).",4,Bring Your Gal War Movie,1402876800,"06 16, 2014",2014,2152,"['was', 'made', 'movie', 'bring', 'girlfriend/wife', 'reviewers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'understand', 'especially', 'considering', 'age', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'love', 'story', 'movie', 'there', 'keep', 'lady', 'entertained', 'seeing', 'prince', 'charming', 'war', 'returning', 'back', 'now', 'valiant', 'hero.Meanwhile', 'story', 'otherwise', 'conscientiousness', 'objector', 'Quaker', 'having', 'make', 'choice', 'believing', 'faith', '34', 'becoming', 'own', 'man', '34', 'typical', 'day', 'otherwise', 'CO', 'would', 'be', 'Mr.', 'Ladd', 'getting', 'too', 'messy', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'end', 'prove', 'mettle', 'not', 'Rambo', 'ending', 'Mr.', 'Ladd', 'duty', 'fulfill', 'future', 'wife', 'bliss', 'tad', 'funny', 'moments', 'movie', 'many', 'buddy', 'movies', 'war', 'rowdy', 'lower', 'deck', 'interaction', 'especially', 'fight', 'scene', 'merchant', 'marine', 'good', 'cause.Like', 'maturity', 'level', 'movie', 'refreshing', 'change', 'sheer', 'pornographic', 'nature', 'modern', 'films', 'certainly', 'not', 'something', 'take', 'girlfriend/wife', 'watch', 'Nice', 'balance', 'Mr.', 'Ladd', 'star', 'power', 'leading', 'man', 'man', 'need', 'watch', 'manly', 'man', 'war', 'movie', 'too.DVD', 'quality', 'mentioned', 'others', 'indeed', 'rather', 'poor', 'almost', 'straight', 'transfer', 'complete', 'film', 'imperfections', 'person', 'who', 'really', 'DVD', 'quality', 'will', 'need', 'wait', 'better', 'transfer', 'especially', 'clean', 'up', 'noise', 'adjust', 'chroma', 'color', 'balance', 'film', 'showing', 'reddish', 'darkroom', 'tone', 'too', '.4', 'Stars', 'due', 'really', 'poor', 'video', 'quality', 'YouTube', 'videos', 'have', 'higher', 'video', 'quality', 'rather', 'cheesy', 'acting', 'here', 'there', 'crew', 'overall', 'acting', 'quality', 'content', 'nice', 'mixture', 'love', 'humor', 'action', 'thinking', 'time', 'especially', 'where', 'Mr.', 'Ladd', 'decide', 'faith', 'principles', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', '1958', 'movie', 'asking', 'girlfriend', 'wanted', 'martini', 'front', 'traditional', 'Quaker', 'mom', 'was', 'stretching', 'moral', 'aspect', 'day', 'even', '1958', 'social', 'mores']",Deep Six VHS
