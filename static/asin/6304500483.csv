By creating this film, the memory of Brandon Lee, as well as the reason for writing The Crow in the first place, have both been utterly tarnished.

426143,AZSN1TO0JI87B,6304500483,A. Estes,"[1, 2]","More of a remake than a sequel, ""The Crow: City Of Angels"" attempts to capitalize on the cult phenomenon of it's predecessor by basically repeating and rehashing it's basic premise without actually adding anything new or of merit. This time around, instead of Detroit, it's a decaying Los Angeles -- populated by set-pieces that look like they could be destroyed by a stiff breeze -- and Vincent Perez is summoned from the dead to avenge the death of his son and himself at the hands of a gang, with the help of Sarah (Mia Kirshner), who may or may not be the same Sarah from the first movie. Music video director Tim Pope, who hasn't done anything worthwhile since, gives this film a definite mid-90's look. Truth be told, not only does the movie look low-budget and meant for direct-to-video release, but also looks like something you would catch on HBO at three in the morning during a weekday. As hard as the script tries -- which, come to think of it, it doesn't -- it just can't match the potency of the original. Instead of getting to know our main characters and building the required backstory with the tragic elements needed, the exposition is handled in such a careless way. It seems like they wanted to get the story out of the way so they could get straight to the violence. A father avenging the murder of his own child? Should have had a little more emotional impact than what was actually presented in the movie. The actors all pretty much ham it up, although punk icon Iggy Pop manages to keep the audience from falling asleep, while his co-star, Thuy ""Yellow Ranger"" Trang, is at the very least, an interesting presence in a movie such as this. On all accounts, ""The Crow: City Of Angels"" is and was a complete and utter failure, dooming the rest of the franchise into direct-to-video Hell.

But this film is meant to be different; in a different place, different time and with similar circumstances happening to very different people.Vincent Perez brings his own stylings to this already overly stylish film. The use of reds and yellows to give the city a feeling of dirt, smog and an overcast of despondency works fairly well. The whole film feels much more surreal than even the first film's city did; the people here, more corrupt, violent and perverted but it's the triangle of stories that give the film the boost that pushes it out of the gutter of failed sequels.Mia Kirshner does a fair job of playing a much older Sarah though her face reamins a bit too blank when there should be more emotion. Ashe, the new Crow and his son are, of course murdered for being in the wrong place at the wrong time and end up at the bottom of the sea. Upon the Crow's return he receives help from Sarah to begin his trail of revenge. The triangle here is that while he tries to carry out said revenge, he falls in love with Sarah at the same time, the main evil doer this time around, Judah, plots to do whatever he can to stop Ashe before he gets to him. Iggy Pop makes a wacky appearance as one of Judah's subordinates, Curve, getting to be his usual out of control self, even after all these years.In the end it's an interesting concept, decent delivery and at times feels too short, as if parts could've been added or explained in more depth, but if your a fan of the series, you should at least give it a chance.",3,A Stand Alone Piece,1092960000,"08 20, 2004",2004,1772,"['When', 'watching', '2nd', 'installment', 'Crow', 'movie', 'series', 'would', 'only', 'hurt', 'viewing', 'experience', 'trying', 'compare', '1st', 'film', 'know', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'Eric', 'Draven', 'perhaps', 'finest', 'Crow', 'film', 'meant', 'be', 'different', 'different', 'place', 'different', 'time', 'similar', 'circumstances', 'happening', 'very', 'different', 'people.Vincent', 'Perez', 'own', 'stylings', 'already', 'overly', 'stylish', 'film', 'use', 'reds', 'yellows', 'give', 'city', 'feeling', 'dirt', 'smog', 'overcast', 'despondency', 'works', 'fairly', 'well', 'whole', 'film', 'feels', 'much', 'more', 'surreal', 'even', 'first', 'film', 'city', 'did', 'people', 'here', 'more', 'corrupt', 'violent', 'perverted', 'triangle', 'stories', 'give', 'film', 'boost', 'gutter', 'failed', 'sequels.Mia', 'Kirshner', 'fair', 'job', 'playing', 'much', 'older', 'Sarah', 'face', 'bit', 'too', 'blank', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'emotion', 'Ashe', 'new', 'Crow', 'son', 'are', 'course', 'murdered', 'being', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'end', 'up', 'bottom', 'sea', 'Crow', 'return', 'help', 'Sarah', 'begin', 'trail', 'revenge', 'triangle', 'here', 'carry', 'out', 'said', 'revenge', 'love', 'Sarah', 'same', 'time', 'main', 'evil', 'doer', 'time', 'around', 'Judah', 'plots', 'do', 'whatever', 'can', 'stop', 'Ashe', 'Iggy', 'Pop', 'wacky', 'appearance', 'one', 'Judah', 'subordinates', 'Curve', 'getting', 'be', 'usual', 'control', 'self', 'even', 'end', 'interesting', 'concept', 'decent', 'delivery', 'times', 'feels', 'too', 'short', 'parts', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'added', 'explained', 'more', 'depth', 'fan', 'series', 'should', 'least', 'give', 'chance']",N/A

And Mia Kirshner makes a fine heroine, a pseudo tatoo-artist mentor who leads Perez into his predictable odyssey through a Los Angeles futuristic netherworld of drug addicts, sexual deviants and homeless children. But where this sequel loses direction is in its glorification of brutality - from prisoners of the main villain, to innocent victims in the streets of this civilization where the sun never rises.Certainly the character of The Crow, an inspired combination of Batman, the Vampire Lestat and Ozzy Osbourne, is the stuff fueled by imaginative adolescent nightmares. This series will always have at least that going for it. Trenchcoats, motorcycles, smeared make-up, bad hair days - The Crow must rank as one of the hippest superheroes in history. And occasionaly director Tim Pope (obviously schooled at the MTV film institute) produces a strong image or two in spite of himself. The Crow lounging on the side of a building is the stuff of great blacklight posters. The Crow marching down a dark alleyway towards a retreating villain is an impressive portrait.But for all these visions, the viewer is force-fed the typical - the wooden Iggy Pop as a mannequin villain, the unexceptional Richard Brooks as a one-note ringleader of evil, the faceless Thuy Trang as a high-kicking murderess. Undoubtedly ""The Crow - City of Angels"" has been inspired by multiple films of Japanese cinema, popularized in Western culture by the works of John Woo and mimicked by Hollywood with ""The Matrix,"" and there are times when squinting your eyes just right, you might be able to see English subtitles (I am kidding, of course).But then comes the predictable B-Movie scenes of brutality, the obvious symbolism of the Day of the Dead celebration, and the excessive servings of faceless murder. And the final conflict of this contrived drama, where what appears to be thousands of crows fly through the soul of the main villain, is about as lazy a resolution/triumph as you will ever see in a film.Darkness comes from a tortured soul, and it has far more depth than ""The Crow - City of Angels"" could ever hope to dream of.

I didn't want my enjoyment of the first film to be tarnished by a mediocre sequel, but I figured, ""what the heck"" and went ahead and rented it. While at first I considered Tim Pope's ""The Crow: City of Angels"" (1996) to be a huge disappointment, especially when one compares it to the original, in all honesty, it's not that bad of a film and it has its redeeming qualities.The cinematography is somewhat of a mixed-bag. While the original film was dark and bleak, it was done with elegance and style, ""City of Angels,"" by contrast with its intrusive soundtrack and heavy-handed glumness, can come across as cartoonish--like a B horror movie or a Marilyn Manson/Rob Zombie video. Still, the post-apocalyptic vision of the future with its barren, hopeless, filthy  landscape is captivating.While the plot is essentially just a rehash of the first movie, except a father/son are the murdered victims instead of a couple, the father's devotion is touching.  The gang of bad guys (with the exception of Iggy Pop) are mostly mostly faceless, although the chief bad guy, (some bald dude) with his narcissistic, psychopathic personality is kind of interesting.  The ending is somewhat confusing and disappointing, with the main villain  taking away all of the Crow's power only to be overtaken by a flock of crows? Huh? Although the last scene, with the Crow and his son going to ""a better place"" is good way to conclude the film.As for the character of the Crow himself , while Brandon Lee's character was funny, savage and human, Vincent Perez (as Ash) in this film comes across as a soap opera actor, a good lucking guy with a wooden delivery going through the motions. Mia Kirshner, the Crow's love interest, serves no real purpose to the storyline and her death at the end is entirely pointless to the narrative.""City of Angles"" best character is Iggy Pop, as the vile thug ""Curve"" and is easily as good as ""Tin Tin"" or ""Funboy"" from the original movie. I also enjoyed the scenes of the Crow (the actual bird, not Perez) in flight--some very cool cinematography there.A commercial and critical failure, ""The Crow: City of Angels"" pretty much torpedoed the Crow franchise, with next few movies going straight-to-video.

Where do you go from there?The Crow: City of Angels (not to be confused with the Nicolas Cage/Meg Ryan drama City of Angels that was released a couple years later) takes the Crow story out of the darkly stylized pseudo-Detroit to a smoggy stylized pseudo-Los Angeles. Taking place at least 10 years after the original film, an adult Sarah (this time played by Mia Kirschner) has moved to L.A. and become a tattoo artist, but is plagued by dreams of the second arrival of The Crow.But instead of Eric Draven, we get Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez), a mechanic who is resurrected from the dead with the gift of invulnerability after being killed alongside his young son by a gang headed by the local druglord Judah Earl (Richard Brooks). Judah's gang is comprised of Spider Monkey (Vincent Castellanos), Nemo (a young Thomas Jane), Kali (Thuy Trang of Power Rangers fame), and Curve (rockstar Iggy Pop). Ashe sets out to take murderous vengeance against the gang, hunting them down one by one, hoping he'll be reunited with his son's spirit in the afterlife when he's finished. But things become complicated when Ashe and Sarah fall in love, and Judah discovers Ashe's one weakness.So first, the good things about the film: the production design. The film looks great. This polluted, smog-covered L.A. seems like its constantly cast in an jaundiced light, like the whole city is dying of liver failure from all the drugs and decadence its denizens feed itself. Its walls are covered in graffitti, its streets are littered with trash, and any sane person with enough sense would've left for another city long ago (I wonder what a Crow-ized pseudo Seattle or San Francisco would look like, but they're probably just as corrupt and polluted). The first film used Halloween and the night before, Devil's Night, as a backdrop for Eric Draven's story. But this film uses the Day of the Dead (Dio de los Muertos) in a similar way, as both celebrations share similarities. And the film make Day of the Dead look like a pretty cool party that should be observed more often outside of Mexico and L.A.But aside from those bright spots, the film is just not very good. Unfortunately, with a story like The Crow, you often have to follow the same story beats, making the film feel derivative and uninspired. Man gets killed, a loved one is also killed in the process, man returns from the dead, man hunts down and kills his murderers one by one. Lather, rinse, repeat with each sequel. Don't believe me? Also check out The Crow: Salvation. I haven't seen The Crow: Wicked Prayer, but I'm probably not going out on a limb and assuming it's no different. But how else would movie producers attempt to recapture the success of the first film without its star? By rehashing the same story over, and over, and over, and over. This film does attempt a more melancholy tone, but it results in a film feels more slow and plodding. The film's finale feels as butchered as it actually is. The original ending forced Ashe to choose between Sarah and his son, and it's a decision that ultimately leaves him without both of them in the end. However, studio interference led to cuts that removed that choice from the plot, leaving the film with a sense of stiltedness and unresolved ambiguity.City of Angels' script doesn't fare much better. Written by David Goyer (yes, of The Dark Knight Trilogy), the dialogue is somber and vaguely spiritual at times, repetitive at others. Ashe often repeats the last things each gang member said to him before they killed him. It's meant to be ironic, but it becomes stale and predictable really fast.Vincent Perez is miscast as Ashe. Half the time, his dialogue is barely intelligible underneath his thick accent. And I can't even tell what kind of accent it is. Is it French? Is it Italian? Is it Spanish? Where is Ashe supposed to be from? Whatever the case, you can't make out what he's saying. And as for his acting...well, yeah. He doesn't feel very menacing, and he has baffling moments of overacting that are downright comical. There is a scene where he trashes his garage amidst flashbacks of his son, and all it amounts to is a lot of yelling, kicking shelves, and knocking things down. I've seen just about the same amount of genuine emotion in Tommy Wiseau's attempts at angst in The Room, and I can't help but chuckle now.The rest of the cast fills out their parts no better, aside from Iggy Pop. At least Curve comes off sufficiently creepy. Richard Brooks' line delivery feels more like he's reading from a children's book instead of a script. Mia Kirschner's Sarah just doesn't seem to have much of a personality aside from being mopey and doe-eyed. Thuy Trang doesn't even seem like she can handle the film's violent content. It's like she's holding back, and not out of an actor's artistic restraint but because she really doesn't wanna be there.The film's music is decent if not very memorable. There's an ethereal orchestral score, but no particular theme that feels iconic. The film uses the occasional source music, with songs from the likes of Hole, PJ Harvey, Filter, and yes, an Iggy Pop song made the cut. Rock band The Deftones makes an appearance at the Day of the Dead celebration. This film tries to present us with a soundtrack to match the first film's impressive music, but like most of the film as a whole, it too falls short of those lofty ambitions.And that's ultimately what this film is, an attempt to capture the first film's success but a disappointing failure that makes you kinda wish they didn't try.",2,"Great production design, but the rest of the film is

Goyer (who has since gone on to greater fame as the writer/co-screenwriter of BATMAN BEGINS & co-story writer of THE DARK KNIGHT, and now co-story writer/screenwriter of MAN OF STEEL) and director Tim Pope. I hope that the Director's Cut is released on DVD someday, so we can see what their vision for the film was, before Miramax decided to re-edit it in order to make it similar to the first movie.As released, though, The Crow: City Of Angels is a sub-par sequel. Worth seeing only once. Vincent Perez did a good job as Ashe (his French accent and sinistrous voice were perfect for this film) and Mia Kirshner was under-used as Sarah. I wish there had been more than just a brief passing reference to Eric and Shelly. Thuy Trang was also under-used as Kali. And what was the point of Sarah befriending the little girl if the girl was going to remain on the streets?The only thing I didn't like was the profaning of God'a Name (ie. combining the Name of God with a mild profanity).Rated R (strong violence, language, including several uses of a religious profanity, and some nudity).",3,Interesting Sequel.

Life is nothing but a showcase that hides the real dark world of death that lurks behind the wings of the crow, the wings of the stage on which we strut like peacocks. And in those wings we could find, if we dared to go behind them, death in all its forms, in all its shapes, be it drugs, be it extreme sex, be it violence, be it torture, be it suffering. There is no escape from this unfathomable truth. This vision is a deep dive and high jump into what rots and reeks beneath the surface of our sunny world, of our rich society, of our brilliant culture. Beneath it all there is only the coming doom of the end forecast by some blind visionary, some blinded priestess, some self-blinded witch that will cast her oracle onto us when she wants, when she decides, because it is her fate to do so when her blind vision will cease or become too bright for her eternal night. What can we do against this destiny ? Nothing except maybe become as bad as all this is, and get our vengeance on the puppets who are manipulated by some evil force that they do not even know exists. Evil is eternal and bottomless. Evil is the only future we keep in our heritage from the dark centuries of the past. He who thinks God is dead is right. He who thinks Satan never existed is right. He who thinks that man is the only perpetrator of his own doom is right. The doom of humanity will not come from some transcending force but only from the rule that the supreme predator that man is will eventually destroy the whole species, and man is already at work in that direction, some men being ready to kill everyone and even the planet and life as a whole in the name of the survival of the fitter, that is to say of them who will then destroy themselves when they do not have any more preys to chase after and kill. The survival of the fittest, then, will mean the end of the whole humanity and the return of chaos, which is nature naked and brutal because chaos is a human concept to describe the natural order of the eternal cycle of life and death. And in our malediction we may keep, in the deepest and darkest layers of our mental eye, the image of a child that could not survive this hazardous providence. God bless the child.

Obviously not everyone will like this kind of thing, its rather slow paced, and best for just sitting there and kind of laying around watching it, not really for people into intense action or comedies.",4,Could have been better,1095811200,"09 22, 2004",2004,848,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'Crow', 'movie', 'i', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'biased', 'opinion', 'movie', 'people', 'really', 'say', 'sucks', 'compared', 'first', 'Crow', 'i', ""'d"", 'really', 'like', 'see', 'first', 'becusae', 'must', 'be', 'amazing', 'did', 'have', 'one', 'major', 'problem', 'movie', 'was', 'fact', 'villans', 'were', 'just', 'overly-done', 'have', 'defined', 'character', 'everything', 'do', 'reek', 'evil', 'be', 'repetitive', 'point', 'nausia', 'Other', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'dialouge', 'sparce', 'making', 'most', 'characters', 'rely', 'movements', 'thier', 'looks', 'give', 'feel', 'whats', 'going', 'Obviously', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'like', 'kind', 'thing', 'rather', 'slow', 'paced', 'best', 'just', 'sitting', 'there', 'kind', 'laying', 'watching', 'not', 'really', 'people', 'intense', 'action', 'comedies']",N/A
426172,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,6304500483,J from NY,"[1, 2]","I haven't seen this film since it left theatres, so I suppose the visual impact of it must have been somewhat significant; I haven't forgotten one scene and recall most of it in detail.  (Tim Pope is another one of those directors who mistakes music videos for movies.)There's a problem, though: it was really bad.The problem, as I recall, is that we know nothing about Ashe Crowe (wow. what an original last name for this movie.): he's just some unbelievably nice father who (lives?) in a garage shop with his son, Danny.  Till guess what?  A bunch of drug-using, scummy semi-gangsters come and ruin his, uh, idyllic life by murdering his son and then him.  Vincent Perez is nowhere near Brandon Lee's level of talent as an actor, and Lee himself was no Olivier.But Iggy Pop!  He's perfect as the badass scumbag (""nothing personal, sport..."") who puts the final shot in Perez's character on the docks.  He's so good that it's almost like he's not acting.  The best scene in this movie is when Crowe, after blasting Pop's character to nearly nothing, places two coins in his eyes and sends him floating on the scummy city river: heavy handed symbolism, yes, very striking, yes as well.Otherwise, it sucked and strikes no comparison to the Gothic, almost believable majesty of the original.  I remember reading James O'Barr saying that he wanted nothing to do with the film before it came out and did not want his name in the credits.  Good move on his part.Watch the original and read the comic book.",2,"Some redeeming factors, but not many",1147392000,"05 12, 2006",2006,1500,"['have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'left', 'theatres', 'suppose', 'visual', 'impact', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'somewhat', 'significant', 'have', ""n't"", 'forgotten', 'one', 'scene', 'recall', 'most', 'detail', 'Tim', 'Pope', 'one', 'directors', 'who', 'mistakes', 'music', 'videos', 'movies', 'problem', 'was', 'really', 'bad.The', 'problem', 'recall', 'know', 'nothing', 'Ashe', 'Crowe', 'wow', 'what', 'original', 'last', 'name', 'movie', 'just', 'unbelievably', 'nice', 'father', 'who', 'lives', 'garage', 'shop', 'son', 'Danny', 'Till', 'guess', 'what', 'bunch', 'drug-using', 'scummy', 'semi-gangsters', 'come', 'ruin', 'uh', 'idyllic', 'life', 'murdering', 'son', 'then', 'Vincent', 'Perez', 'nowhere', 'near', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'level', 'talent', 'actor', 'Lee', 'was', 'Olivier.But', 'Iggy', 'Pop', 'perfect', 'badass', 'scumbag', 'nothing', 'personal', 'sport', 'who', 'final', 'shot', 'Perez', 'character', 'docks', 'so', 'good', 'almost', 'not', 'acting', 'best', 'scene', 'movie', 'when', 'Crowe', 'blasting', 'Pop', 'character', 'nearly', 'nothing', 'places', 'two', 'coins', 'eyes', 'floating', 'scummy', 'city', 'river', 'heavy', 'handed', 'symbolism', 'yes', 'very', 'striking', 'yes', 'well.Otherwise', 'sucked', 'comparison', 'Gothic', 'almost', 'believable', 'majesty', 'original', 'remember', 'reading', 'James', ""O'Barr"", 'saying', 'wanted', 'nothing', 'do', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'name', 'credits', 'Good', 'move', 'part.Watch', 'original', 'read', 'comic', 'book']",N/A

Paul ""John doe""","[1, 1]",I know I'm going to p**s a lot of people off but this is a good sequel it's not as good as the 1st cause none of sequels will ever be as good. Casting is great Vincent Perez playsAshe Corven/The Crow Richard Brooks Plays Judah Eral Mia Kirshner plays Sarah Iggy Pop plays Curve & Thuy Trang plays Kali. This movie I feel has a darker tone the story is Ashe Corven & his son witness a murder & are killed by members of Judah Eral's gang. Sarah from the 1st movie from the 1st movie is an adult she has changed mutured & it is for the better. I know a lot of you will say oh I liked the Sarah from the 1st movie better so you like a foul mouthed annoying (at times brat.) You had to pay to watch her you don't have to pay to read my reviews. You want to see s****y go watch Katie Stuart from the TV show. Sarah sees Ashe & Danny's murders in her dreams the Crow leads her to Ashe she actually applies the paint to Ashe so it actually has a reason unlike Salvation to have the style of paint that Eric Draven had. Greammer Revell returned & done the score the soundtrack is still b****in' White Zombie Filter & a young Deftones.

426174,A25RN8X70DSZLU,6304500483,JRP,"[0, 0]","I didn't know if I wanted to do go ahead with this review or just wait until it's anniversary & review for 20 years ago. This review is for the very , very, very, very very underrated sequel The Crow City Of Angels. It is called a rehash of The Brandon Lee classic I understand that it's hard to follow up with that movie cause you had a lead I cared about entertaining villains quotable villains like Top Dollar who was a really good to great villain as well as 2 side characters I cared about great score & awesome soundtrack. I disagree that Crow City Of Angels is a total rehash 1 there's only so much you can do with 2 people being killed & 1 comes back for revenge. I'm glad they didn't bring back The Eric Draven character cause he already took care of business & Brandon Lee died. Plus James O'Barr couldn't do it cause he had Brandon Lee on the brain & he couldn't do it. So they got David S Goyer who had wrote scripts for Death Warrant & went on to write scripts for Blade 1 & II as well as the new Batman movies. I have read his original script & if that script was used in it's entirety then it would've been even better then what we got. Back 4 years ago I was lucky to get my hands on a copy of The Fan Edit called The Crow City Of Angels Second Coming. It's better than what was released. That fan edit added more to The Crow mythos like if you disobeyGo  d you won't be allowed to cross over & you can take The Crow's power. The movie was made for $13 million had a good opening weekend it ended up making $17 million in The US while it did ok it didn't even break even seeing how much money goes into marketing, advertising & gross share among theaters. Directed by Tim Pope a music video director but if you get a chance to ever see The Second Coming fan edit or the version shown on Pay Per View you'll understand what this movie was going for. This failure destroyed Tim Pope I hope 1 day he can get a 2nd chance. I don't know who has the rights I don't know if it's Echo Bridge if they have the original print of the movie cause they have rereleased this movie & put out a Blu Ray even which I will tell you don't even bother with that Blu Ray cause the picture quality isn't any better & it's the 84 minute version. Mirimax mainly The Weinstien's wanted this movie to be like the 1st movie. Anyway the movie stars Vincent Perez as Ashe Corven, Richard Brooks as Judah Earl, Mia Kirshner as Sarah, Iggy Pop as Curve & Thuy Trang as Kali. The story in the future in Los Angeles this man named Ashe & his Son Danny are killed by gang members that work for this Drug Kingpin named Judah Earl. Basically Judah orders their death & before they're killed Curve, Kali, Nemo & Spider Monkey taunt them like Curve kisses Ashe & Kali sings ""Hush Little Baby"" before she kills Danny just a disgusting group of villains I'd say they're even more nasty than the villains in the 1st movie. Anyway you're introduced to an adult Sarah who lives in LA at this Loft & she works at a Tatoo Parlor you have an apperance by Ian Dury as the owner. Sarah is having dreams about Ashe & Danny being murdered & she keeps being visited by a Crow she is lead to the docks by The Crow where she witnesses Ashe resurrection. He finds out he is dead which Vincent Perez does a really good acting in these scenes. Sarah explains to him he has been brought back to put the wrong things right she paints his face which makes sense that he'd have a similar pattern to Eric Draven cause Sarah is the link to the 1st movie. He sets off to get ready you have a good song playing ""Jurassitol"" by Filter. He goes after Spider Monkey who is making this drug called Trinity. Also Ashe rides on this Harley which is cool. Anyway he goes after Spider Monkey & chases him through the warehouse & then when he has him he starts messing with him which they keep traits these people had when they were alive like the 1st movie with Eric was in band & you see later on playing the guitar. Ashe likes magic tricks he takes a deck of cards & him pick 1 of the card I forgot which 1 he picked but Ashe tells him ""Lady luck is ab  i  t  ch!""He blows up the drug lab when he leaves you have another good song ""I'm Your Boogie Man"" by White Zombie. He finds out the people involved in Judah's gang he goes after Nemo at The Peep O Rama a s  3  x shop you have an early appearance by Thomas Jane. Meanwhile Curve finds what's left of The Drug Lab there's a Crow symbol on the ground & the bird flies past some palm trees they catch fire. Curve also got a tatoo at shop where Sarah works at it's suppose to represent 2 demons fighting but as time goes on it takes the shape of a Crow. Judah finds out about this so he intends to take The Crow's power. Meanwhile Nemo is talking to thiss  *  ut named Holly Daze & the time runs out in the peeping booth & he puts a token in & Ashe is on the other side he goes after Nemo you have a guy who I guess is the owner fire a shot gun at Ashe & he takes it from him also there was a scene that was cut out where Ashe confronts Holly Daze & tells her to leave & never come back if she values whatever she's lost. They don't show how Nemo was killed but Curve & Kali find him dead with a blow up doll in his pants & Curve finds a note in the shape of a Crow in Nemo's mouth Ashe calls from a Pay Phone & Curve picks up the phone he asks Curve ""Do you know what they call a gathering of Crows> Curve? A murder. A murder of crows. Think about it?"" There is more dialogue between Ashe & Sarah they did try to force feed the romance between them. Ashe tracks Curve down to a bar & when Ashe pulls out The Shotgun the bartenders were suppose to shoot Ashe & freak out when they couldn't kill him. Which that's in The Second Coming I got that off of ioffer when the gettin' was good. He chases Curve on his Motorcycle down to a dead end & Curve comes at him charging on his Motorcycle Ashe fires his Shotgun at The Bike & it explodes & knocks Curve back to the dead end he puts a coin in Curve's mouth he tells the dying Curve ""People used to put coins in the mouths of the dead. Do you know why? So they could pay the Ferrymen to take them across the river Styx."" He leaves the dying Curve to float off to wherever. The Crow shows him that Sarah's in trouble he goes to her apartment where he has a fight with Kali & it's a good fight I like the part where Kali asks ""Do you know how to fight?"" Ashe's response is ""Do you know how to die?"" I enjoy this house you see how crazy Ashe has became & he's just messing with Kali everything she does against him doesn't work. She tries to leave he grabs her by the leg tosses her across the room which I guess he broke her leg. He then picks her up & tells her ""Hush little baby, shh don't say a word. Daddy's going to buy you a big black bird?"" Cause Kali sung that when she killed Danny. Ashe throws her out a window her head even hits a car outside. For everyone who says Ashe is too soft or not as violent as Eric Draven I disagree he blew up a drug lab with a man still in it he threw the woman that killed her Son to her death & in The Second Coming fan edit he watches Kali die & she wants him to kill her to put her out of her misery & finish the job she tells him there's no honor in this. He tells her his job was to send her to h3  l  l. His character while not as violent I'll say he's crueler. He made her suffer. Ashe then goes to Judah's Tower & you find out a bit of backstory on him cause when he was a kid he fell in a lake of ice & died & he sawh  *  *  l & when he came back to he brought back with forbidden knowledge. There is more cool Crow mythos added cause Ashe has a link with the bird in The Second Coming fan edit Ashe can turn into a giant Crow & when the bird feels pain he can feel pain like when Judah kills The Crow & Judah drank some of the birds blood & took The Crow's power so he's invincible which that's something different. Now in all of the other home releases Danny tells his Dad not to give up in The Second Coming he tells his Dad his job is finished Ashe tells him he can't leave Sarah trapped. He is told he won't be allowed to cross over since he cause he's doing something for the living & he's part of The Land Of The Dead. Judah beats owns Ashe since he took his power he tries to hang Ashe & starts hitting him with a whip. Sybil Judah's Prophet frees Sarah & she takes a Misery Cord that Judah used to kill The Crow she stabs Judah in the eye Judah drops Ashe he stabs Sarah in the stomach Ashe impales Judah on a pipe Judah says ""You can't stop me anymore Ashe. You haven't got the power. There's nothing but pain for you know."" He tells him pain is his power & he uses The Murder Of Crows technique on Judah the effects of bad but The Second Coming fan edit takes care of that bad effect for the most part. Also there is more dialogue between Ashe & Sarah before she dies & she gives him the ring that Eric gave her in the 1st movie. He takes Sarah's body to a church where Priest asks him why he's still here he tells him 1 more shadow in the city won't help. Then it shows Ashe driving his Motorcycle. So Crow City Of Angels to me is a good sequel I almost like as much as the 1st movie & while it does rehash some things from the 1st movie especially The Second Coming if they would've put out what Tim Pope & David S Goyer wanted in 1996 or had put out a real extended cut on DVD or put what they originally filmed on a good Blu Ray then  maybe fans of the 1st movie would see it as a good sequel. I know people just hate it cause it's a sequel to The Crow & that was Brandon Lee role & I love The Crow & Brandon Lee was gone too soon but Vincent Perez isn't playing Eric Draven  but he's playing a different character Ashe Corven. The look of the movie is really good. I feel it's darker than the 1st movie not saying it's better than the 1st Crow cause that movie is better it's an excellent film. I like the stuff they did like adding to The Crow mythos. Vincent Perez did a great job. Richard Brooks was good. Mia Kirshner was good. Iggy Pop did a good job. Thuy Trang was good. If you're interested in this movie at all rent it or it's on TV don't pass it up before buying cause it's a real divisive movie if you see The Crow City Of Angels Second Coming fan edit anywhere online DVD or streaming get it do not pass it up cause it makes it much better movie.

426175,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,6304500483,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[7, 9]","Before reading on, please note that I only give this movie 1 out of 5 stars, but Amazon won't display it correctly for some reason. Anyways, carry on.After the huge success of ""The Crow"", one automatically assumed that a sequel would soon be in the works. However, due to the tragic death of the original film's star, Brandon Lee, there was some doubt as to whether or not a new film should be made. In the end it was decided that each new Crow film would feature an all-new character taking over the avenging mantle.This decision didn't set well with some fans of the original. Many of them felt that continuing the series without the presence of Brandon Lee would be trampling upon the memory of his performance. Personally, even though I do agree that Brandon Lee portrayed the best version of the Crow, the idea of changing out the main character every time suited the franchise perfectly. Not to mention, the original film didn't exactly leave an open ending for the return of Eric Draven. So, even if Brandon had lived, I think this was the proper course for the series to take.""The Crow: City of Angels"" is set in a city resembling a completely depraved version of Los Angeles. Slowly destroying this city one life at a time with a highly addictive drug is the sick and twisted Judah Earl (Richard Brooks) and his gang of deviants. One of their latest victims, a man named Ashe (Vincent Perez), who was brutally murdered along with his young son by the gang, has returned to avenge their deaths. Joined by a mysterious young woman named Sarah (Mia Kirshner) and the mystical crow, Ashe begins his mission of revenge. However, will he be strong enough to stop the evil that destroyed his life?Despite the assurances from screenwriter David Goyer that this film would rock, while paying respect to the first film, and above all, please even those fans of the original that felt it was tantamount to sacrilege to continue the series; in the end, this sequel just does not work. So, how could this happen when it seemed that the movie had so much going in its favor?Well, for starters the story written by David Goyer (""Batman Begins"") is even darker, more twisted, at times sadistic, and utterly weak that it can't help but pale in comparison to its predecessor. The original film was dark, and featured some undeniably twisted characters for villains, but they never reached this level of depravity. Even in that film's darkest moments I didn't get the sense that those times were simply being included gratuitously to push the envelope of edginess in film.For instance, there were numerous occasions where rather than include some much needed character or plot development the movie opted to show more sadistic and/or perverse imagery. Typically this was done at a time when Ashe was soon to be encountering one of the gang members responsible for his murder. Obviously these scenes were to make us hate the villains even more than we already do. The problem is that these moments occur far too often in a single 90 minute movie. Plus, it was a lazy way to convey the evil inherent in a particular villain, so that when Ashe dispatches his brand of justice the audience will be completely on his side. This was unnecessary because only the coldest of viewers would not completely hate characters willing to kill a father and his son. So, to go to such extremes just to give us these extra tidbits of incentive to root for Ashe was irrelevant.I for one don't want to be force fed in such an obvious fashion via these demented sequences that this gang and its leader are evil incarnate. Find some compelling way to tell the story, and over the course of the movie reveal these various criminal activities or dark traits to me. You don't have to beat me over the head with this crap in an almost non-stop manner for me to understand the sheer malevolence on display. I'm not so dense that I can't pick up on plot points and character development spread out over the course of a movie.Beyond the degeneracy on display from the completely one-dimensional villains, the two ""good"" characters Ashe and Sarah were uninteresting and boring compared to any of their forebears from the original. Their moments together were intended to showcase them as star-crossed lovers, plus give us some insight into their characters. Ultimately though, there was no real spark between the two of them and I never really got to learn much more about them either. Part of me believes this is due to neither performer really giving their all in the scenes, on top of the fact that the script was paper-thin.Honestly, if it wasn't for the obligatory flashback sequences filling us in on what happened to Ashe and his son, we really wouldn't know much about him or care. Truth be told, the only reason we even remotely root for him to succeed is because of the unbelievably heinous nature of the criminals he's hunting, which again is due to the repeated usage of disturbing imagery and the flashbacks of the murders.As for Sarah, there were several unanswered questions surrounding her character. Such as, what exactly is her link to the mystical crow and how did it come about? Plus, is she on the run from her memories or just can't stand being in a single location for too long? Maybe her whole backstory is a combination of the two or neither. Whatever the case may be, screenwriter David Goyer managed to mishandle virtually every single aspect of this film's story from start to finish. This meant that no matter how incredible the director or actors and actresses may come across, the movie was destined to fail from the get-go.It is due to weak points in the story such as these that led this sequel to feeling like some half-hearted, under-developed attempt at cashing in on the previous movie's success and perhaps even the memory of Brandon Lee. Thankfully, in the years since ""The Crow: City of Angels"" David Goyer appears to have fine-tuned his writing skills, and has crafted many a terrific screenplay. Perhaps it was just an off day for him when he wrote this drivel or the studio and/or director hamstringed him during the filming and editing processes. Who knows?Speaking of the film's director, Tim Pope, this is as far as I can tell his only feature film work to date, otherwise he's typically a music video director. I will grant Tim that he was straddled with a shoddy screenplay full of sickness and disgust, so the task of making this film even remotely entertaining was daunting. Although, he is apparently a fan of rocker Iggy Pop's, who also happens to appear in this film and Iggy is one twisted individual from what I can tell. So, maybe this movie wasn't a challenge to work on after all, except for the whole ""make it entertaining"" part. Hmmm...Anyways, I should give some credit to Tim and his crew for creating a very eerie atmosphere for the movie. Where the original film seemed to borrow heavily from Tim Burton's influence, this movie featured a distinctive tone all its own to set it apart from not only the previous movie, but any comparisons to other darker heroes as well. Beyond that, I don't have anything really good to say for Mr. Pope, because he doesn't appear to be all that talented of a director in my estimation. Every scene featuring the criminals felt repetitive, as did scenes of Ashe riding his motorcycle or talking with Sarah. Nothing about this movie's visual style, beyond the look and atmosphere, stood out or was exciting in any respect.Finally, we arrive at the film's cast, or as I think of them, the last remaining weak links in this already fragile chain. To begin, new lead star Vincent Perez (""I Dreamed of Africa"") was a poor follow-up to Brandon Lee's superb performance as Eric Draven. Now, I didn't set out to compare the two actors' performances, but being a sequel a comparison is inevitable and in my estimation, warranted. Vincent never seemed to possess, or at least be able to convincingly convey the rage of his character the way Brandon did with Eric. With Vincent, he always seemed uneasy and when he did begin to cut loose in a possible fit of rage, he wound up looking goofy. Plus, his character seemed too effeminate much of the time, so I was never really sold on him being the avenging type, which would be the key for Vincent to really sell this character to the audience.Portraying the only returning character from the original film, Sarah, although this movie is set several years later in her life, is actress Mia Kirshner (""The Black Dahlia""). Mia as shown in various other projects, both in film and on TV, is a very capable and talented actress. Yet her portrayal in this film, as I touched upon earlier, is incredibly disappointing and uninspired.Maybe her reasons for not appearing as committed to the role as I felt she should be is due to her character's bizarre, unexplained traits and lame story arc. I mean, if I were in her shoes, and given a character that is exhibiting odd abilities and seems to be on the run from something in her past (which doesn't make sense given how things were looking up for her at the closing of ""The Crow""), then I would probably find it difficult to get into the role. So perhaps the blame cannot fully rest with her, but must be laid once more at the feet of David Goyer and his script, or director Tim Pope.Rounding out the main characters of this movie are actor Richard Brooks (TV's ""Law and Order"") and rock star Iggy Pop (""Snow Day"") as the film's primary villains. Actually, I must correct myself, if you looked at the movie's screen time for the various characters, you would make the assumption that these two villains were the only main characters of the story, and that Ashe and Sarah were ancillary roles rather than the leads. Anyways, I digress.As the leader of the gang responsible for Ashe and his son's murder, Judah Earl, is Richard Brooks. Much like Mia Kirshner, I know Richard Brooks is a capable actor in other roles, but even though his actions are despicable and steeped completely in all things evil, he as a character was never menacing. His performance just never really sold me on Judah being this man that commands the respect of all these deviants that he surrounds himself with, and that he would be in control of an apparently vast drug empire. I just don't see how he would have risen to such a powerful role compared to some of his underlings, in particular the most immoral and wicked of the gang, Curve played by Iggy Pop.Speaking of Iggy, his portrayal of Curve was over-the-top, twisted, and had an underlying streak of insanity running throughout. Out of the entire cast, Iggy's was the only performance that was interesting, if for no other reason than that I wasn't sure what exactly he was going to do next. So at the very least he proved to be an intriguing presence, even though his character takes part in seemingly every vice conceivable by man. That being said, he also is given numerous ridiculous lines of dialogue that are so bad it's laughable, and many times he seemed to be overacting which made his performance amateurish at best. It is with those thoughts that make the fact that his was the most memorable performance of the bunch, all the more sad and pathetic.You know, it's a shame that such an excellent movie could kick start what should be a promising franchise, only to have said franchise begin to falter with the first sequel out of the gate. But, that's what happens when your follow-up is plagued by a horrible script that is bogged down by the sickest and most twisted individuals one can conceive of, uninteresting performances for the most part, and repetitive sequences that show zero creativity or imagination. If you enjoyed the original movie, but never got around to this particular sequel, feel free to skip it.

I love the first Crow, It was a very dark adaptation of the comic which featured awesome acting and great action, and gory kills. The Crow: City of Angels was dismissed as a cash in right off the bat when it was announced, People thought it was a disgrace to the late Brandon Lee(R.I.P) which is understandable but City of Angels really is a good film. I have not seen The Crow: Salvation or The Crow: Wicked Prayer yet but I especially heard Wicked Prayer is the worst of the series.Plot: Ashe Corven(Vincent Perez) and his Son as they witness a gang murder a guy, The gang then kills Ashe and his son and Ashe gets resurrected by a crow and becomes The Crow to get revenge on the gang that killed him and his son. Sounds almost like the first one and the plot is near the first one but it is not the same. Iggy Pop gives a good performance as one of the gang members as well as a young Thomas Jane. Vincent Perez is good as well but of course not better than the great Brandon Lee. Mia Kirshner plays a older Sarah in the film and does a good job.DVD: Warning, Get the Collector Series DVD if you plan on buying City of Angels, Do not get the Miramax DVD released a couple of years ago or the Blu-Ray put out a couple years ago because the picture quality on the Collector Series DVD is better and it has a ton of features, The recent Miramax releases have no features.Overall: If you do not compare City of Angels to the first one, You may enjoy it.

This is like the 20th time I've watched it. First of all, you have to forget THE CROW. It has no ties to the first one, it's a completely original character and story. It goes without saying, the first one is better. THE CROW is my favorite movie of all time. This movie is not bad though. It received so many negative reviews from critics however, which is too bad, because it is a very good movie. Vincent Perez does a wonderful job portraying Ashe; a man murdered along with his son, Danny, after witnessing a murder. Sarah (the litte girl from the first movie) returns in City of Angels, played by Mia Kirshner, to look after Ashe. Judah, played by Richard Brooks, doesn't even come close to Top Dollar, who was the main villain in the first movie, but he's ok. Judah does have one of the film's best lines though, when Ashe tells him to go to hell and he says ""Already been there, and I must confess, I like what I saw.""The dark and dreadful mood is still wonderfully intact, which I love. The look of this film is just as good as the first. There are so many great moments in this movie that I can never forget, such as when Sarah paints Ashe's face with Danny's old paints, the part where Ash pulls Curve's body out into the water and flowers surround him in the form of a crow, and the unforgettable ending when Judah is destroyed. It's classic. Another great aspect of this movie is how Ash mocks the words of the killers - what they said just before they killed him and his son - just before he kills them.I think most people never even wanted to give this movie a chance because of what happened to Brandon Lee, and that's understandable but at the same time a shame because a great talent was passed over in Vincent Perez, and a great movie as well.",4,"Timeless, just like the first...",1044230400,"02 3, 2003",2003,1951,"['realize', 'movie', 'seven', 'years', 'old', 'was', 'surfing', 'net', 'happened', 'see', 'Crow', 'City', 'Angels', 'was', 'television', 'thought', ""'d"", 'put', 'positive', 'words', 'film', '20th', 'time', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'First', 'all', 'have', 'forget', 'CROW', 'ties', 'first', 'one', 'completely', 'original', 'character', 'story', 'saying', 'first', 'one', 'better', 'CROW', 'favorite', 'movie', 'time', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'received', 'so', 'many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'critics', 'however', 'too', 'bad', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'Vincent', 'Perez', 'wonderful', 'job', 'portraying', 'Ashe', 'man', 'murdered', 'son', 'Danny', 'witnessing', 'murder', 'Sarah', 'litte', 'girl', 'first', 'movie', 'City', 'Angels', 'played', 'Mia', 'Kirshner', 'look', 'Ashe', 'Judah', 'played', 'Richard', 'Brooks', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'Top', 'Dollar', 'who', 'was', 'main', 'villain', 'first', 'movie', 'ok.', 'Judah', 'have', 'one', 'film', 'best', 'lines', 'when', 'Ashe', 'go', 'hell', 'Already', 'been', 'there', 'must', 'confess', 'like', 'what', 'saw', 'dark', 'dreadful', 'mood', 'still', 'wonderfully', 'intact', 'love', 'look', 'film', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'moments', 'movie', 'can', 'never', 'forget', 'such', 'when', 'Sarah', 'Ashe', 'face', 'Danny', 'old', 'paints', 'part', 'where', 'Ash', 'Curve', 'body', 'water', 'flowers', 'surround', 'form', 'crow', 'unforgettable', 'ending', 'when', 'Judah', 'destroyed', 'classic', 'great', 'aspect', 'movie', 'how', 'Ash', 'words', 'killers', 'what', 'said', 'just', 'killed', 'son', 'just', 'them.I', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'never', 'even', 'wanted', 'give', 'movie', 'chance', 'what', 'happened', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'understandable', 'same', 'time', 'shame', 'great', 'talent', 'was', 'passed', 'Vincent', 'Perez', 'great', 'movie', 'as', 'well']",N/A

The more I see it over time, though, the more I have to admit that it is a decent effort. Of course nothing can top the first film and the story of Eric Draven. But then, this film doesn't really try to rip off the first. Afterall, both are based on O'Barr's comic book series- and there are many Crows. You'll never run out of Crows, because you'll never run out of restless spirits, monstrous injustice, and the unavenged dead.The two films are tied together nicely, though. It wasn't until probably the third time that I saw it that I realised that the female lead, Sara, is the little girl from the original film. She has grown up and moved as far away from Detroit and Devil's Night as she can get. Unfortunately, she has run to the City of Angels and the Day of the Dead.... In any case, the sets, the costumes, and especially the music, definately give the same overall feel of the original- if anything it is even more gritty and extreme.The character of Ash is not your typical macho action hero. He is decent, sensitive, average guy- who has his only son murdered in front of him. My only question is this- if the they wanted to play up the sensitivity and murdered child angle, then why didn't they make this incarnation of the Crow a woman?",5,Many Crows- Many Monsters,1068940800,"11 16, 2003",2003,1303,"['feelings', 'sequel', 'were', 'mixed', 'first', 'more', 'see', 'time', 'though', 'more', 'have', 'admit', 'decent', 'effort', 'course', 'nothing', 'can', 'top', 'first', 'film', 'story', 'Eric', 'Draven', 'then', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'try', 'rip', 'off', 'first', 'Afterall', 'are', 'based', ""O'Barr"", 'comic', 'book', 'series-', 'are', 'many', 'Crows', ""'ll"", 'never', 'run', 'Crows', ""'ll"", 'never', 'run', 'restless', 'spirits', 'monstrous', 'injustice', 'unavenged', 'dead.The', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'tied', 'together', 'nicely', 'though', 'was', ""n't"", 'probably', 'third', 'time', 'saw', 'realised', 'female', 'lead', 'Sara', 'little', 'girl', 'original', 'film', 'grown', 'up', 'moved', 'far', 'away', 'Detroit', 'Devil', 'Night', 'can', 'get', 'Unfortunately', 'run', 'City', 'Angels', 'Day', 'Dead', 'case', 'sets', 'costumes', 'especially', 'music', 'definately', 'give', 'same', 'overall', 'feel', 'original-', 'anything', 'even', 'more', 'gritty', 'extreme.The', 'character', 'Ash', 'not', 'typical', 'macho', 'action', 'hero', 'decent', 'sensitive', 'average', 'guy-', 'who', 'only', 'son', 'murdered', 'front', 'only', 'question', 'this-', 'wanted', 'play', 'up', 'sensitivity', 'murdered', 'child', 'angle', 'then', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'incarnation', 'Crow', 'woman']",N/A

Following their bosses orders to not leave any witnesses, the thigs murder the two, then throw their bodies in the harbor. Ashe comes back to avenge his and his sn's death. He's helped by Sarah, who i think is supposed to be the orginal Sarah from the orginal movie. Eventually, Ashe goes up against Judah, the very odd drug lord.What i liked: Well..not a lot honestly. The look was pretty cool, and the first part had me watching. Sybil, the blind girl, was interesting. And i liked the moments with the little girl, Grace. I was glad to see Sarah was in this.What i didnt like: the story just didnt grab me after a while. to be honest, it seemed like the screenplay writer was a bit confused as to what to do between Ashe and Sarah. you could tell had Ashe not be doomed to go back to the dead, there might have been a relationship. But that just wouldn't have fit. The bad guys were pathetic, except for Kali, she was pretty good. Even Judah. It seemed they tried to make him almost godlike, and that dosn't work very well.Sarah: she was weaker then i thought she'd be.

I've heard it said that one of the crew members on the first movie actually thought it was cursed.But this second movie, which is based around a new Crow (Vincent Perez) and the returning Sarah from the first movie (played in this one by the beautiful and dark Mia Kirshner) wasn't cursed like the first one, the curse this had was that it was a sequel to something that likely didn't need one.  Although I enjoyed the dark circumstances that surrounded the actual onscreen play, with the nod to ""La Dia De los Muertos"" (The Day Of The Dead) being my favorite, the story about a murdered father who returns to avenge his son, to me, takes away from the romantic overtones of the first movie and the Crow comic book overall.The original story was written by James O'Barr to help him exorcize the demons he lived with after losing his first love early in life and he's made mention that in truth, the Crows story was told then, and in his eyes had been told completely.  But as with all things we find interesting or fall in love with, it was decided that there needed to be more, so they made more.I kind of doubt Brandon Lee would have come back for the sequel if he'd lived as I'm sure he would have felt, as O'Barr did, that Eric Dravens story had been told.  I make a few leaps here, making mention of things James has said to me and maybe a little of what I hope Brandon Lee would have done had he survived the accident that took his life, but I make them with the best intentions.I enjoyed the movie, being a comic book geek, I was sure I would.  I have to admit to having felt a little betrayed when the sequel came out, just as I was when the ensuing comic follow-ups came out, but the Crow has become an avenger of wrongs that couldn't be put right any other way, a dark hero to the masses who suffer and have no way to let that out other than to dream of a hero who would go beyond death to right their wrongs and although Eric and Shelleys story was told to completion, there are more stories to tell.  This is one of them.  There are others, there will be others, likely as many as there are people with stories of their own, because truly, who among us doesn't feel the need at some point in our lives to be avenged?See the movie, be forewarned that it contains violence in the extreme, some nudity and a lot of what might be termed ""the darker aspects of life"", drugs, gangs, betrayels, S&M; and torture.  Iggy Pop, though not great either, was a welcome touch of dark realism to the play on the screen.

I actually liked that idea the each movie that comes out would have  it's own unique spin.  Sometimes I find that the problem with sequels is  that the whole movie seems forced in a way.  So going into the movie, for  a moment or two, I'm feeling this sequel has the potential to be better  than the first Crow. Unfortunately everyone on this movie seemed to just  drop the ball and after the first twenty minutes any momentum Goyer's story  had gained disintegrates into same revenge-o-rama that was found in the  first movie. And for all his luscious command of texture, Pope cut his  teeth making music videos - and it shows. He pads the now-uneventful story  with at least three. There's the &quot;Just Discovered I'm The Crow and I  Think I'll Ride My Motorcycle&quot; video. There's the &quot;Here's L.A. By  Night, Sort of Looks Like Blade Runner&quot; video (a perennial hit with  many sci-fi directors). And there's the &quot;I Want To Fall in Love With  You But I Think I'll Ride My Motorcycle Instead&quot; video. Despite the  fact that the soundtrack includes music by Hole, Filter, Bush, White  Zombie, Seven Mary Three, P.J. Harvey and N.Y. Loose, these sequences are  cotton wadding for the mind.  The movie, in the end, is even less - and  that's a pity. The first Crow was undone by circumstances beyond anyone's  control. Brandon Lee (son of Bruce, and around whom it was hoped they could  build a series) was accidentally shot to death during a stunt, and the film  released was pasted together from the action sequences, which were most of  what they'd managed to film.

Berk,"[1, 3]","As a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000, and the general practice of mocking bad films I can honestly say that there was no redeeming value in `The Crow: City of Angels.'  The film is just downright sloppy, and very unnecessary given the plot of the first film and how it didn't warrant a sequel in ANY way, but you know Hollywood: if one film makes a profit they need to try and repeat that film's formula and cash in again.This movie was a low-budget film, roughly $18 million in total cost, which doesn't say anything about the quality, because Alex Proyas, with a simple $15 million managed to make the first film- one of the most visually captivating comic-based films of all time.  But what the disadvantage this film does have is that director Tim Pope has nowhere near the talent of Proyas.  In fact, 95% of this film's visual style is a carbon copy of the original film, only now most of the city is lit by bright, YELLOW lights, and it happens to be situated beside the ocean.  Other than this the style of this film is a rip-off and being a rip-off fails to captivate the mind of the audience in the same way as the first film.Not to rip on Vincent Perez, but his performance as the new Crow was downright despicable- a pale, heartless imitation of Brandon Lee's critically acclaimed character in the first film.  This is probably more the fault of the director and scriptwriters, but regardless, this comes across more as a perversion of Brandon Lee than of a new character picking up the mantle of the Gothic anti-hero.The script is one of the cheesiest you'll ever see.  There is literally a point where the villain kills and drinks the blood of the crow and then gets the strength of the Crow.  This makes absolutely no sense and in no way reflects ANY of the mythos in either the first film or the comic series.The Crow is just too simple of a story to be made into an effective franchise because the formula runs like so: guy and loved one are brutally murdered, guy kills dudes who murdered him and said loved one, leaving a crow emblem at the crime scene, then when he's done he dies and joins loved one in afterlife.  This is all The Crow is.  It was good for one movie, but it just cannot be turned into a franchise.Keep in mind, I was half asleep when this movie was on TV, and even then -the time of day when I'm most acceptable of bad movies- I still managed to hate this movie with a passion, and not because I was a fan of the original, or because I had read bad buzz surrounding the movie (I hadn't even HEARD of it before that fateful night- and for good reason!) , but because I honestly, and truly could not stand ANY aspect of this film.If you enjoyed the first film and the James O'Barr comic book, don't do as I did: do the smart thing.

It really created some tension. This movie, by contrast, seemed like a series of unrelated events. The episodes of revenge didn't build on each other - if they had been edited into any other order, it probably wouldn't have made much difference.The ending seemed weak. I like some mystery, I don't need to have eveything explained, but I want a movie to follow its own internal rules. This one just seemed to make up new mysterious forces whenever the scriptwriter got confused.The visual styling is noir grunge, and fairly effective. The majority of the movie has a nearly monochromatic color scheme in one hue or another. The last scene, in the afterlife, was dominated by blues. Cool and calm, it worked. The majority of the movie used tones of orange, though. I found the choice of color odd, and just never developed a strong response to it.I like The Crow as a series, I like the gritty city images, and I like thoughtful use of color to set a mood.
