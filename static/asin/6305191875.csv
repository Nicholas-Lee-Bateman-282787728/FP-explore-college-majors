But arson only brings Henry so much joy, so he turns his new partner onto murder.  This has been edited from the theatrical release (I don't know why) so the violence has been toned down.  Again, the performances are good, but this one doesn't really grab you.  Hopefully we'll see the uncut version soon, which might improve things.

MPI decided to cut most of the violence and gore out to get an R-Rating for the video and DVD release and the results are less than thrilling.  Every murder scene has been edited to the point where you see practically nothing (cutaways to the murderers' strained faces instead).  The movie in it's original form was quite a strong and grim follow-up to the classic original, but this abbreviated edition is practically worthless.  Maybe someday MPI will release the original uncut version, but I doubt it since most fans have already made up their minds that the movie sucks based only on seeing the edited version.  The DVD does have a behind-the-scenes featurette that does show several clips from the film of the UNEDITED murder scenes with blood spurting everywhere....isn't it funny that they can get away with an R-rated video release as long as the gore scenes are an &quot;extra&quot; and not actually IN the film.

Cricket is the female lead who you just might reconize from Grey's Anatomys.(Kate Walsh) Any ways he discovers his boss is a Arsonist for hire. Well this is right Herny's alley he gets to burn things for cash. Well they run into problems at one of the sites and have to kill a couple of teens. Henery tries to lead his boss down a path of murder for fun. He follows at first but even with booze and drugs he finds he does not have the guts for it. Well as you can tell it a wild romp for Henry and his new friends. It does not have that same creepy feel as the first one but it does offer a pretty good second film.
