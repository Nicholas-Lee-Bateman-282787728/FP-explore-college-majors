694506,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0000639HO,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[6, 14]","Before every episode of that sci-fi classic television series X-Files there would be a promotional teaser that would claim, ""All of your questions will be answered...""  While you would watch the show, hoping that Mulder and Scully would finally find the answers to life, ultimately by the end, there would be more questions with very very few answers.  It was the X-Files and over time we found ourselves used to no questions answered, and continued randomness coupled with confusion.  Rare Birds seemed to be directed by an obvious X-Files fan, because here you have a film that is being marketed as the next Saving Grace or Waking Ned Devine, but oddly ends up like neither of these films and more like an unanswered episode of that alien miniseries.  There are so many unanswered questions with implausible moments in Rare Birds that instead of focusing on the possible great and unique characters, our minds get muddled in the tangent, random, and completely unfocused story.  Rare Birds could have been a comfortable film, it could have been easy, simple, and relaxed, but too many unfamiliar coincidences caused this ""independent"" film to flap poorly in the wind.  Rare Birds will transform any avid bird enthusiast into a full-fledged hunter, shooting any bird that step within their path!What makes Rare Birds an interesting film (and keep in mind this is the only interesting part of the film) is that as you watch this film, you can pinpoint exactly where the muddling begins.  There is an exact moment in this film where you can see that the director wanted to add so many different elements that they could not control them all.  From the tangent cocaine story (causing unfocused elements in characters that are not developed), to the scientifically profound lights, to the recreational submarine, all the way to the supposed central focus of this film ... the rare bird.  One would think that the rare bird story, hoping to build a sorrowed character's life to be better, would be the central moment, the breaking moment, but instead the rare bird story is just as unfocused as the rest of the film.  Early in the film Hurt and Jones go into Jones' basement and all of these stories collide together.  Sadly, when we leave the basement, nothing has been straightened out.  This is when our story, Rare Birds, begins to burn and into a slowly crashing direction.  It is obvious that Edward Riche's novel has quite a bit more about the characters and their inner-voice explaining better situations.  Alas, this did not transform well into a film version.  Director Gunnarsson has way too much on the plate, and as we see in other films in the same vein, there becomes a fuzzy central focus.  The rare bird story should have been the focus, but instead we attempt to learn about cocaine (and Dave's apparent addiction), the ""Winnebago"" group, and some random science light issue that is never fully explained thoroughly.  Rare Birds starts strong, but ultimately fails because of the classic ""buffet-line"" issue.  Gunnarsson should have followed the rules, ""Take all you want, but eat all you take""!Occasionally with films that are as painful as Rare Birds, you sometimes get a great cast that overshadows the failing story.  Hurt is awful.  I have seen him in so many good films over the years, but this seemed to be too simple of a role for him.  Was he doing it for just the cash or was he overplaying the simpleton character?  I couldn't tell.  Hurt seemed to play Dave with so much remorse, so much pain, that you never could understand what his true story was.  His reaction to his wife was flimsy, the story between him and Molly Parker was subsequently as weak, and his reactions to Jones were uncharismatic.  He felt bored in this film, and instead of being funny, he just felt sad.  His character was nothing to write home about, and I blame Hurt because I know he could have pushed deeper and had fun with Dave overall creating an enjoyable hour and a half.  This did not happen, and we were pained for that exact amount of time.  The same can be said for Molly Parker who danced her way out of our hearts and Andy Jones who played his character to discretely.  There was too much counterbalance between Hurt and Jones that they could not play off each other well.  What could have been a decent buddy scenario like Waking Ned Devine turned out to be just two characters talking about incoherent nothing.  The story matched the characters, overall souring this film.Overall, Rare Birds was a horrible film.  It had the potential to be just a simple, sweet story about friends helping each other, but instead too much was thrown into the mix to muddle the overall tone of the story.  With the synopsis centering around some rare birds helping a friend gain new business, I went into the film expecting a buddy story centered with this rare bird story.  Alas, it never really congealed that way.  That is the biggest gripe of this film.  I don't mind getting into a film and experiencing something different, but this was a completely tangent storyline.  Nothing was ever developed, nothing was ever answered.  I really didn't want an answer by the end of the film, but at the end I felt cheated and wronged.  Even the supposed ""love story"" didn't seem real, but instead very forced.  Pass on Rare Birds if you can.  It has nothing to do with friendship and very little to do with birds.Grade: * out of *****",1,"Reminded me of a buffet, ""Take all you want, but eat all you take""...",1154822400,"08 6,

The movie looks from the beginning like it is supposed to realistically depict event occurring in the real world, but if you take it that way you will end up confused (especially when the Mounties show up in force at the end of the film and no one gets arrested). Think of it as a middle age male fantasy with Bill Hurt playing the ego, Andy Jones as the id and Molly Parker as the anima (I know I'm mixing Freud and Jung, just play along). Whatever ""happens"" in the movie is peripheral to the Bill Hurt character falling in love, once again, with his soul. It's sort of a Dante-Beatrice thing.

Probably some of the best acting I've seen for awhile. The story weaves around the beautiful coast of NewFoundLand and William Hurt's characters restaurant, The Auk. Hurt is a great cook but his place is located in some remote seaside area, which causes a lack of customers. Anyways, Phonce, who is always the creative planner, the leader in the twosome, comes up with some zany ideas to bring fortune to Hurts character and also to himself. The scenes involving the mini submarine are some of the funniest I've seen in awhile.

Sadly, the salad days are long since past and it's only a matter of time before the bank closes in. He holds onto the place out of habit and because he has nothing or no one else.

So, in a last ditch effort to save both, 'Phonse comes up with an idea.It's an ingeniously simple, but brilliantly twisted idea that will alter Dave's life forever - if he can maintain himself and his guilt-pressured bowels.It had been a very long time since I enjoyed losing myself in a mildly out-of-kilter movie world inhabited by strong quality characters. Good friends, good meals, fine wines, an absolutely stunning beauty in the form of actress Molly Parker, industrial spies from the recreational vehicle conglomerates, 26 pounds of abandoned cocaine, perpetual fusion energy, an extinct mallard, and lest we forget, a homemade submarine of questionable seaworthiness.Very much in the vein of ""Local Hero"" - this quiet wonderous film produces what I consider 'true magic' - that of love and friendship.Personal Note: If you enjoyed this film I highly encourage you to readthe source novel. I rarely write book reviews, but Edward Riche's work developed and reveals the characters in a way that a film will never be able to sufficiently capture, no matter how good it is as a standalone creation. Also notable due to the verbatim content sourced from the novel and used unedited as the script for the movie.",5,"Wonderful, Fantastic, And Yes - Rare. 10 Stars If It Were Possible",1338681600,"06 3, 2012",2012,2440,"['Detest', 'when', 'reviewers', 'number', 'marginal', 'films', 'mindless', 'fans', 'are', 'whipped', 'frenzy', 'legion', 'talking', 'heads', 'critics', 'parroting', 'what', 'say', 'worse', 'believing', 'what', ""'ve"", 'witnessed', 'actually', 'way', ""'special"", 'category', 'can', 'think', 'good', 'dozen', 'half-baked', 'flicks', 'where', 'more', 'important', 'invoke', 'sanctioned', 'dogma', 'rather', 'speak', 'personal', 'truth', ""'Bridesmaids"", ""'Avatar"", 'immediately', 'come', 'mind.This', ""n't"", 'one', 'them.I', 'remember', 'when', 'first', 'viewed', 'film', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'genuinely', 'floored', 'Completely', 'exhausted', 'laughed', 'loved', 'out', 'utterly', 'depleted', 'simple', 'joy', 'story', 'Dave', 'restauranteur', 'running', 'small', 'out-of-the-way', 'little', 'eatery', 'Auk', 'cold', 'New', 'Foundland', 'Sadly', 'salad', 'days', 'are', 'long', 'past', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'bank', 'place', 'habit', 'nothing', 'one', 'else', 'Having', 'separated', 'wife', 'Dave', 'quietly', 'inevitable.His', 'nearest', 'neighbor', 'best', 'friend', 'fellow', 'epicurean', 'Alphonse', 'enterprising', 'exuberant', 'fellow', 'who', 'see', 'buddy', 'spirit', 'business', 'swirling', 'drain', 'So', 'last', 'ditch', 'effort', 'save', ""'Phonse"", 'up', 'idea.It', 'ingeniously', 'simple', 'brilliantly', 'twisted', 'idea', 'will', 'alter', 'Dave', 'life', 'forever', 'can', 'maintain', 'guilt-pressured', 'bowels.It', 'had', 'been', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'enjoyed', 'losing', 'mildly', 'out-of-kilter', 'movie', 'world', 'inhabited', 'strong', 'quality', 'characters', 'Good', 'friends', 'good', 'meals', 'fine', 'wines', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'beauty', 'form', 'actress', 'Molly', 'Parker', 'industrial', 'spies', 'recreational', 'vehicle', 'conglomerates', '26', 'pounds', 'abandoned', 'cocaine', 'perpetual', 'fusion', 'energy', 'extinct', 'mallard', 'lest', 'forget', 'homemade', 'submarine', 'questionable', 'seaworthiness.Very', 'much', 'vein', 'Local', 'Hero', 'quiet', 'wonderous', 'film', 'what', 'consider', ""'true"", 'magic', 'love', 'friendship.Personal', 'Note', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'highly', 'encourage', 'readthe', 'source', 'novel', 'rarely', 'write', 'book', 'reviews', 'Edward', 'Riche', 'work', 'developed', 'characters', 'way', 'film', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'sufficiently', 'capture', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'standalone', 'creation', 'Also', 'notable', 'due', 'verbatim', 'content', 'sourced', 'novel', 'used', 'unedited', 'script', 'movie']",Rare Birds

Like THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD, RARE BIRDS could have been a refreshing film.  It has a wonderful look, set in the rural area of Nova Scotia, and an appealing premise and cast.  Unfortunately, it never really seems to go anywhere and it never really comes to an end.  William Hurt plays a down on his luck restaurant owner who is separated from his wife, and who may have to sell his establishment since no one patronizes it.  Andy Jones plays his imaginative friend, Alphonse, who has invented an RSV - RECREATIONAL SUBMARINE VEHICLE, and he is sure that the Winnebago people are spying on him and wanting to take his invention.  He's also found an immense amount of cocaine, which he asks Hurt to try and price for him.  Jones has also devised a non-electrical source of light which plays an important role in the movie's finale.  Jones also offers Hurt a solution to his problem:  call a radio talk show and tell them he's sighted an extinct bird that is hovering near the restaurant and all the birdwatchers in the world will show up and his business will boom, which does indeed occur, but not without the prerequisite difficulties.The photogenic Molly Parker plays Jones's sister in law who helps out at the restaurant and falls for Hurt in the making.While the film has some admirable qualities, it just doesn't come together enough for me to rate it any higher, but oh that song!!!",2,NICE TRY,1151020800,"06 23, 2006",2006,1526,"['One', 'favorite', 'songs', 'fifties', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'YOU', 'KNOW', 'wonderful', 'Della', 'Reese', 'highlight', 'disappointing', 'film', 'LITTLE', 'ENGINE', 'THAT', 'COULD', 'RARE', 'BIRDS', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'refreshing', 'film', 'wonderful', 'look', 'set', 'rural', 'area', 'Nova', 'Scotia', 'appealing', 'premise', 'cast', 'Unfortunately', 'never', 'really', 'go', 'anywhere', 'never', 'really', 'end', 'William', 'Hurt', 'down', 'luck', 'restaurant', 'owner', 'who', 'separated', 'wife', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'sell', 'establishment', 'one', 'Andy', 'Jones', 'imaginative', 'friend', 'Alphonse', 'who', 'invented', 'RSV', 'RECREATIONAL', 'SUBMARINE', 'VEHICLE', 'sure', 'Winnebago', 'people', 'are', 'spying', 'wanting', 'take', 'invention', 'also', 'found', 'immense', 'amount', 'cocaine', 'Hurt', 'try', 'price', 'Jones', 'also', 'devised', 'non-electrical', 'source', 'light', 'important', 'role', 'movie', 'finale', 'Jones', 'also', 'Hurt', 'solution', 'problem', 'call', 'radio', 'talk', 'show', 'tell', 'sighted', 'extinct', 'bird', 'hovering', 'restaurant', 'birdwatchers', 'world', 'will', 'show', 'up', 'business', 'will', 'boom', 'indeed', 'occur', 'not', 'prerequisite', 'difficulties.The', 'photogenic', 'Molly', 'Parker', 'Jones', 'sister', 'law', 'who', 'out', 'restaurant', 'falls', 'Hurt', 'making.While', 'film', 'admirable', 'qualities', 'just', ""n't"", 'come', 'together', 'enough', 'rate', 'higher', 'song']",Rare Birds

694518,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B0000639HO,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[6, 7]","""Rare Birds"" chronicles the life of Dave (William Hurt), chef of ""The Auk"" in a small coastal town in Newfoundland. Business is sagging, and Dave is preparing to sell the restaurant when wacky Fonce (Newfoundlander Andy Jones in a brilliant turn as always) cooks up a scheme involving the sighting of a rare bird (in reality, an extinct duck) to bring flocks of birdwatchers to the area and boost business. The plan works, but the two get more than they bargain for: there are numerous other subplots, some unnecessary, such as the cocaine stash, a love affair between Dave and Alice, Fonce's bookish sister-in-law, the RCMP Bulgarian light conspiracy, and the Winnebegos.Molly Parker's Alice was a delight, as was Andy Jones' neurotic Fonce. I thought that the entire cocaine subplot was unnecessary. The bathroom humour seemed too base as well, although limited to one (thankfully) brief scene. Although Ebert regards ""Rare Birds"" as more of a wacky Newfoundland character study than ""The Shipping News,"" I disagree. I found that ""The Shipping News"" had a much more engaging plot and much more involved characters. The pacing of ""Rare Birds"" is sometimes slow and awkward, and I didn't really relate to Hurt's character, which made it much harder to enjoy the film as a whole.The DVD offers very little in the way of special features, mainly a few computer-generated sets from production designs, a trailer (which shows what the film *could * have been if it had lost the excess baggage) and a commentary by director Sturla Gunnarsson.
