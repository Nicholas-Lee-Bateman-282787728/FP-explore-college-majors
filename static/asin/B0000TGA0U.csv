But now, even if you, too, don't have the station, you can still watch this phenomenal show! I loved every moment of every episode, and being able to have it on DVD makes the show not only addicting because you can watch episode after episode, but also very alluring that you can watch it whenever you want!The show is smartly written, and even if you don't enjoy the actual scenes with sex in them, you will surely appreciate the comical ocurrences in each one of the girls' lives. The script is real, and at times surprising, but surely is not to be missed!If you haven't already seen 'Sex and the City,' now is the time!

783157,A1S32HU2JQ5MFG,B0000TGA0U,"Miss Jane ""book girl""","[20, 24]","I should start by confessing that I came to watch SATC very late in the game - not until the start of the 6th Season.  After watching the final episode, the decision to buy the complete season DVDs was a no-brainer, and I have not been disappointed.  The writing on this show is some of the smartest I've encountered in a long time.  It has been interesting and highly entertaining to watch these characters evolve.  (The 5th Season may be short, but the writing quality never wavers.)  I'll watch one episode thinking I that can really relate to Charlotte, only to relate to Miranda, Carrie or (heaven forbid!) Samantha in the next.  And it really isn't just about sex - or the city - but ultimately about the joy and heartbreak in all of life, such as the loss of a parent or dealing with an unexpected pregnancy.Of course, most of the funniest bits deal with the search for ""the one"" - something everyone can relate to.  I think the decision to end after 6 seasons - and on a positive note for all characters - was a smart one.  It may have taken Big six seasons to realize Carrie was ""the one"" but the journey made the result more worthwhile.  (Here again, I must confess that prior to seeing the earlier seasons, I was not entirely convinced that Carrie and Big should live happily ever after.  Mr. Big now gets my full endorsement!)I highly recommend this boxed set (instead of the watered down syndication version being contemplated on other cable channels), and have already pre-ordred Season Six, Part One.  Those concerned with what they perceive to HBO price gouging should consider that an individual season on DVD still costs less than one month of cable service...  And if, like me, the only reason you're watching HBO is SATC (and maybe The Sopranos) perhaps it's better just to cancel HBO and get the DVDs instead!",5,Smartest comedy I've seen in a long time,1079395200,"03 16, 2004",2004,1830,"['should', 'start', 'confessing', 'came', 'watch', 'SATC', 'very', 'late', 'game', 'not', 'start', '6th', 'Season', 'watching', 'final', 'episode', 'decision', 'buy', 'complete', 'season', 'DVDs', 'was', 'no-brainer', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'disappointed', 'writing', 'show', 'smartest', ""'ve"", 'encountered', 'long', 'time', 'been', 'interesting', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'characters', 'evolve', '5th', 'Season', 'may', 'be', 'short', 'writing', 'quality', 'never', 'wavers', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'one', 'episode', 'thinking', 'can', 'really', 'relate', 'Charlotte', 'only', 'relate', 'Miranda', 'Carrie', 'heaven', 'forbid', 'Samantha', 'next', 'really', ""n't"", 'just', 'sex', 'city', 'ultimately', 'joy', 'heartbreak', 'life', 'such', 'loss', 'parent', 'dealing', 'unexpected', 'pregnancy.Of', 'course', 'most', 'funniest', 'bits', 'deal', 'search', 'one', 'something', 'everyone', 'can', 'relate', 'think', 'decision', 'end', '6', 'seasons', 'positive', 'note', 'characters', 'was', 'smart', 'one', 'may', 'have', 'taken', 'Big', 'six', 'seasons', 'realize', 'Carrie', 'was', 'one', 'journey', 'made', 'result', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'Here', 'again', 'must', 'confess', 'prior', 'seeing', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'was', 'not', 'entirely', 'convinced', 'Carrie', 'Big', 'should', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'now', 'full', 'endorsement', 'highly', 'recommend', 'boxed', 'set', 'instead', 'watered', 'down', 'syndication', 'version', 'being', 'contemplated', 'other', 'cable', 'channels', 'have', 'already', 'pre-ordred', 'Season', 'Six', 'Part', 'One', 'concerned', 'what', 'perceive', 'HBO', 'price', 'gouging', 'should', 'consider', 'individual', 'season', 'DVD', 'still', 'less', 'one', 'month', 'cable', 'service', 'only', 'reason', ""'re"", 'watching', 'HBO', 'SATC', 'maybe', 'Sopranos', 'perhaps', 'better', 'just', 'cancel', 'HBO', 'get', 'DVDs', 'instead']",Sex and the City: The Complete First Five Seasons
783158,A1AHI8CUE3OQI4,B0000TGA0U,"monsieurms ""monsieurms""","[1, 9]","When this series started, it was quirky, funny and different. The sexual candor was startling but riveting. In the back of your mind, as with the Seinfeld characters, you perhaps had one qualm, namely about how this was a bit horrific after all. The constant refrain that this was about real women and how they really acted and spoke was kinda scary, and enough to keep some men bachelors forever. Did Princess Charlotte, convinced in fairy tales, make an attractive mate? Or maybe man-averse, chip-on-her-shoulder Miranda? Or slutty Samantha? Carrie seemed the normal one, but as time went on we discovered that she had a Peter Pan complex--inability to commit, setting the bar too high for unrealistic reasons. She dumped Aidan for no reason. In the finale (not on this set), she agrees to accompany Mihail to Paris knowing that he has his most important exhibition of the latter part of his career, a make or break exhibit. She whines constantly about him working rather that squiring her around, even though he's under tremendous stress and she knew he'd have to work.  He's such a cad--free trip to Paris for her, wander around and have fun, while he works desperately to save his career. What an awful guy--according to Carrie. In Carrie's little faux-feminist world, her Self has been vindicated. Others might wonder...why bother? When you see a Carrie coming, run hard and fast in the other direction if you're a single man. As this series wears on, it grates more and more and becomes less and less funny. Samantha suddenly becomes a lesbian? SAMANTHA? C'mon. The last two years of the series were little but tedious as it ran out of steam. But there's good news on this set: all of the early seasons are here and they are hilariously funny, well acted, and exuberant in their vitality. As the set wears on, you may become less thrilled as the edge wears off and turns into reality, but...enjoy the glory years. P.s. I see few people think this helpful. I guess in the world of true fanatics, a word of criticism or two is not acceptable. Blind enthusiasm only is allowed. The simple truth is that this series went wayyyy downhill and lost its way as time went on.",3,"Erratic, but funny",1077580800,"02 24, 2004",2004,2173,"['When', 'series', 'started', 'was', 'quirky', 'funny', 'different', 'sexual', 'candor', 'was', 'startling', 'riveting', 'back', 'mind', 'Seinfeld', 'characters', 'perhaps', 'had', 'one', 'qualm', 'namely', 'how', 'was', 'bit', 'horrific', 'constant', 'refrain', 'was', 'real', 'women', 'how', 'really', 'acted', 'spoke', 'was', 'kinda', 'scary', 'enough', 'keep', 'men', 'bachelors', 'forever', 'Did', 'Princess', 'Charlotte', 'convinced', 'fairy', 'tales', 'make', 'attractive', 'mate', 'maybe', 'man-averse', 'chip-on-her-shoulder', 'Miranda', 'slutty', 'Samantha', 'Carrie', 'seemed', 'normal', 'one', 'time', 'went', 'discovered', 'had', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'complex', 'inability', 'commit', 'setting', 'bar', 'too', 'high', 'unrealistic', 'reasons', 'dumped', 'Aidan', 'reason', 'finale', 'not', 'set', 'accompany', 'Mihail', 'Paris', 'knowing', 'most', 'important', 'exhibition', 'latter', 'part', 'career', 'make', 'break', 'exhibit', 'constantly', 'working', 'rather', 'squiring', 'around', 'even', 'tremendous', 'stress', 'knew', ""'d"", 'have', 'work', 'such', 'cad', 'free', 'trip', 'Paris', 'wander', 'around', 'have', 'fun', 'desperately', 'save', 'career', 'What', 'awful', 'guy', 'according', 'Carrie', 'Carrie', 'little', 'faux-feminist', 'world', 'Self', 'been', 'vindicated', 'Others', 'might', 'wonder', 'why', 'bother', 'When', 'see', 'Carrie', 'coming', 'run', 'hard', 'fast', 'other', 'direction', ""'re"", 'single', 'man', 'series', 'more', 'more', 'less', 'less', 'funny', 'Samantha', 'suddenly', 'lesbian', 'SAMANTHA', ""C'mon"", 'last', 'two', 'years', 'series', 'were', 'little', 'tedious', 'ran', 'steam', 'good', 'news', 'set', 'early', 'seasons', 'are', 'here', 'are', 'hilariously', 'funny', 'well', 'acted', 'exuberant', 'vitality', 'set', 'wears', 'may', 'become', 'less', 'thrilled', 'edge', 'reality', 'enjoy', 'glory', 'years', 'P.s', 'see', 'few', 'people', 'think', 'helpful', 'guess', 'world', 'true', 'fanatics', 'word', 'criticism', 'two', 'not', 'acceptable', 'Blind', 'enthusiasm', 'only', 'allowed', 'simple', 'truth', 'series', 'went', 'wayyyy', 'downhill', 'lost', 'way', 'time', 'went']",Sex and the City: The Complete First Five Seasons
