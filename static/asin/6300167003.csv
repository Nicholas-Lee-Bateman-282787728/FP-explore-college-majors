197965,A266TORT5VENQ7,6300167003,Classic Debut,"[1, 1]","1942 B&W; Shirley Temple, Guy Kibbee, Dickie Moore. I enjoy Shirley Temple as a teenager. She does not lose all her talent as she becomes older. Shirley is 14 and this it the second film she made after her Fox contract expired.  Captain January (Guy Kibbee)costars with her again as her loving and protective grandfather. Child star, Dickie Moore plays her love interest and gives Shirley her first on screen kiss(Hardly a peck on the cheek). The acting is very good in this film, but it is not always a cheerful plot. The movie was made during World War II and it portrays that time period.Many people seem to think that ""A Kiss for Corliss"" (AKA Almost a Bride) is a sequel to this movie, but it has nothing to do with it.  As a Shirley Temple fan I would rank this movie at 37 out of her 46 movies.",4,sweet as a teenager,1311638400,"07 26, 2011",2011,801,"['1942', 'B', 'W', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'Guy', 'Kibbee', 'Dickie', 'Moore', 'enjoy', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'teenager', 'not', 'lose', 'talent', 'older', 'Shirley', '14', 'second', 'film', 'made', 'Fox', 'contract', 'expired', 'Captain', 'January', 'Guy', 'Kibbee', 'again', 'loving', 'protective', 'grandfather', 'Child', 'star', 'Dickie', 'Moore', 'love', 'interest', 'Shirley', 'first', 'screen', 'kiss', 'Hardly', 'peck', 'cheek', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'always', 'cheerful', 'plot', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'time', 'period.Many', 'people', 'seem', 'think', 'A', 'Kiss', 'Corliss', 'AKA', 'Almost', 'Bride', 'sequel', 'movie', 'nothing', 'do', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'fan', 'would', 'rank', 'movie', '37', '46', 'movies']",Miss Annie Rooney VHS
197966,AVWWFK3FZDEL2,6300167003,D. Mckinzie,"[15, 16]","Shirley Temple starred in this movie when she was at that difficult age when most child stars founder and disappear forever.  It's a pleasant, easy to watch movie, although today's kids probably won't care for it much.  Annie Rooney (Shirley Temple), the daughter of an unsuccessful inventor, and her friends meet at each other's houses to dance and have fun.  Listen for the forties slang!  When Annie meets a new boy, and a rich one at that, she teaches him the slang and the dances and he becomes infatuated.  This movie has some well-known character actors and some young actors who became better known later.  Annie's best friend is a scream.  It's particularly funny to hear Annie's father trying to interpret what the kids' slang is saying (""I feel like I'm hearing a foreign language!"") with the grandfather's help.  And Temple is adorable as always, but really gives a pretty good performance, especially considering her age.  A charming movie; well worth watching more than once.",4,The Little Girl starts growing up,1109980800,"03 5, 2005",2005,989,"['Shirley', 'Temple', 'starred', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'difficult', 'age', 'when', 'most', 'child', 'stars', 'founder', 'disappear', 'forever', 'pleasant', 'easy', 'watch', 'movie', 'today', 'kids', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'Annie', 'Rooney', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'daughter', 'unsuccessful', 'inventor', 'friends', 'meet', 'other', 'houses', 'dance', 'have', 'fun', 'Listen', 'forties', 'slang', 'When', 'Annie', 'new', 'boy', 'rich', 'one', 'slang', 'dances', 'becomes', 'infatuated', 'movie', 'well-known', 'character', 'actors', 'young', 'actors', 'who', 'became', 'better', 'known', 'later', 'Annie', 'best', 'friend', 'scream', 'particularly', 'funny', 'hear', 'Annie', 'father', 'trying', 'interpret', 'what', 'kids', 'slang', 'saying', 'feel', ""'m"", 'hearing', 'foreign', 'language', 'grandfather', 'help', 'Temple', 'adorable', 'always', 'really', 'pretty', 'good', 'performance', 'especially', 'considering', 'age', 'charming', 'movie', 'well', 'watching', 'more', 'once']",Miss Annie Rooney VHS

197968,A3NK6P0QFDUZL2,6300167003,G. Charles Steiner,"[1, 1]","This review is from: Miss Annie Rooney [VHS] (VHS Tape)I really like Shirley Temple. I've seen her in Fort Apache, Bachelor and the Bobby Soxer, and Since You Went Away. Heck, I even liked her in Almost a Bride, but this movie . . . this movie was awful. The script was corny and predictable, and Temple's ability to play a teenager while only 14 years old herself --- why I would have thought the director would have yelled ""Cut!"" before half the stuff I saw on the screen got a chance to be put on film. Positively amateurish acting! Critics said her last film as a child star, Young People, was simply awful. No, it wasn't and by comparison to this idiotic work, Young People is up there with Little Colonel and Heidi.I was a teenager myself when I learned that Shirley Temple's first screen kiss had been with Dickie Moore. I have waited decades to see that kiss for myself on screen one day and -- oh, my gosh! A peck on the cheek? His lips barely graze her skin! What?I must say I really enjoyed seeing Temple act along with Guy Kibbee from Captain January. He seemed to enjoy himself being with her, too. But I am embarrassed to have even watched this film. I got to the middle of it yesterday and stopped watching. I couldn't bear the treacle, the sugar, the falsity of the whole thing, Shirley Temple's coy acting included. I only finished it today because I'm a bit compulsive about finishing things I start. I am being generous by giving it three stars. Heck, even Blue Bird -- Temple's box office failure -- is better than this addlepated, sepia-toned ""treasure"" from 1942. This is a first for me, the first Temple film I actually loathe.****P.S. 7/4/13 - I just started reading Dick Moore's 1984 autobiography ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star."" In his own book, Dickie Moore talks not about how terrible he was in the film, ""Miss Annie Rooney,"" but he interviews Shirley Temple as an adult and about the same film she says (on page 63), ""It was a terrible picture."" I'm glad Shirley Temple and I are in agreement.Why no voting buttons?

I can barely remember them, as I was a little, very little child while they were still around.  The film version of jive talk is interesting, in a fun way, as representing the period, if you are interested in those types of cultural changes.  Every new generation thinks they have the newest and best version, that they came up with themselves, but that is far from the truth of it.  I found some personal irony in the film too.  While her parents are scheming, grandpa mentions his ""perpetual motion invention,"" which is what the free energy scam was called then.  My own father was one of those guys who thought he had the ""secret.""  When I finally suggested that he patent his idea, he refused, suspecting the government, or someone would have him killed.  So my slightly eccentric, paranoid father died with his secret, not suspecting that the fraud was so well known, even then (known in the 19the century, in fact!), that it was used as an off-hand joke in this Shirley Temple film.  But the film is fun, cute and entertaining.  It ought to be put out on DVD, perhaps part of a new Temple collection.By the way - Thank you Shirely Temple (Black), I love you.",5,"It's Shirely Temple, Wrinklepuss!",1265932800,"02 12, 2010",2010,1266,"['do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'people', 'say', 'adorable', 'movie', 'really', 'old', 'jalopy', 'featured', 'too', 'can', 'barely', 'remember', 'was', 'little', 'very', 'little', 'child', 'were', 'still', 'around', 'film', 'version', 'jive', 'talk', 'interesting', 'fun', 'way', 'representing', 'period', 'are', 'interested', 'types', 'cultural', 'changes', 'new', 'generation', 'have', 'newest', 'best', 'version', 'came', 'up', 'far', 'truth', 'found', 'personal', 'irony', 'film', 'too', 'parents', 'are', 'scheming', 'grandpa', 'mentions', 'perpetual', 'motion', 'invention', 'what', 'free', 'energy', 'scam', 'was', 'called', 'then', 'own', 'father', 'was', 'one', 'guys', 'who', 'thought', 'had', 'secret', 'When', 'finally', 'suggested', 'patent', 'idea', 'refused', 'suspecting', 'government', 'someone', 'would', 'have', 'killed', 'slightly', 'eccentric', 'paranoid', 'father', 'died', 'secret', 'not', 'suspecting', 'fraud', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'known', 'even', 'then', 'known', '19the', 'century', 'fact', 'was', 'used', 'off-hand', 'joke', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'film', 'film', 'fun', 'cute', 'entertaining', 'ought', 'be', 'put', 'out', 'DVD', 'perhaps', 'part', 'new', 'Temple', 'collection.By', 'way', 'Thank', 'Shirely', 'Temple', 'Black', 'love']",Miss Annie Rooney VHS

There are some great dance sequences for those who are interested in how the jitterbug was done back in the 1940's. Shirley and her friends speak 1940's jive. The plot is similar to her previous movies, but it's a fun, feel-good film that the entire family can enjoy. I hope this movie is issued on DVD.
