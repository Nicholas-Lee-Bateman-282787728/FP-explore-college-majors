Their God orders then to eliminate another tribe, their men, women, and children are offensive. Samuel reminds the King of Israel of the prophecy. Another man will replace him, one of Jesse&#8217;s sons. &#8220;Men judge by outwards appearances.&#8221; Samuel uses two stones to judge the candidates. David is chosen to gather the scattered tribes and drive out the heathen from Israel. David is brought before the king to sing and entertain him. There will be a battle, there will be a challenge between two champions before the battle. Israel sends out a boy to face Goliath, the champion of the Philistines. David gathers stones (used by shepherds to drive away wolves from their flocks). &#8220;So be it.&#8221; The Philistines run off in retreat. The Israelites triumph, David serves King Saul for ten years as commander of his army. David takes a wife, they go to their bridal chamber. &#8216;Did I please you, my lord?&#8221;Men gather together to discuss things. King Saul worries about his reign. There is conflict, the King is jealous. David flees to a refuge. When King Saul searches for him David flees again. Saul orders the priests killed one by one until Samuel talks! David remained in the wilderness for six years. King Saul continues to hunt with his army. Can David meet King Saul safely? David takes a  souvenir to prove a point. A blind man carries a message to the Philistines, he is given refuge. Later King Saul rides out against the Philistines, alone. &#8220;Who marches with the King and his son?&#8221; They face a stronger enemy but succeed at first. Then there is a flanking attack with chariots. The Israelites are defeated, King Saul&#8217;s son Jonathan is slain, &#8220;the mighty are fallen&#8221;. David dances in public. The Ark of the Covenant is shown to David. Later David sees a woman bathing. David plans a new temple on the hill of Zion.Moses commands the extermination of the heathen. People petition King David. He meets Bathsheeba. A woman has no redress against her husband. There is an assault on a woman, her brother Absalon seeks revenge. Murder carries the death penalty, but Absalom is banished from the kingdom. There is another legal problem. &#8220;Thou art the man.&#8221; &#8220;Do what you will.&#8221; His punishment is stated. King David has a son named Solomon. Absalom offers a political solution to the disaffected, the rabble follow him. King David is advised to strike now before its too late. He visits the Ark of the Covenant. Absalom&#8217;s forces are surprised by archers. Absalom flees but is pursued and caught. King David has rejected God&#8217;s commands by not listening to the prophets. David shows his anger by using the sword of Goliath. Later David defeated the Philistines and other heathen tribes, wiping them out. [Ethnic cleansing?] David reigned for forty years then had Solomon anointed King.This portrayal of a Bible story is entertaining and educational. I didn&#8217;t read the book but I&#8217;m sure it is faithful to the original. Human natures doesn&#8217;t change.

209753,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,6300213927,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[84, 89]","When this film was released in 1985, the critics were not kind, but I love this film, and think it's a good telling of the story of David, based on I and II Samuel, I Chronicles, and the Psalms. Though much of it has been compressed (David's relationship with Bathsheba is limited mostly to the consequences of it for instance) and some creative license used for plot continuity, it has a tremendous amount of Biblical accuracy.Taking place from 1000 to 961 B.C., the costuming, sets, and artifacts are fabulous; filmed in Pinewood Studios, U.K., and on location in Italy, the cinematography by Donald McAlpine is wonderful. The score is also lovely, by Carl Davis.The brief nudity in the wedding chamber sequence has in my tape, been darkened so as to be imperceptible; either this is a flaw in the tape, or an effort not to offend and capture a wider audience, which would be silly, as this is a very mature drama. It contains much brutal violence making it unsuitable for children, and the confrontation with Goliath for example (which is exceptionally well done), is one of four beheadings.Richard Gere is a marvelous David, and stands up well against an excellent international cast. He was thirty-five when this was filmed, and is about as handsome as a human has a right to be. The actor who shines above all though is Edward Woodward as Saul. He is riveting, and it's a brilliant character study of courage mixed with jealousy, revenge, and madness.This is far from being a &quot;Big Bible Epic&quot; with lots of  well known stars, instead it's serious and beautifully acted, and perhaps arrived on the scene at the wrong time, that it was so unappreciated two decades ago.

He does make serious mistakes in his life and the largest one was having Uriah the Hittite killed to satisfy his lust for his wife Bathsheba. Of course God punishes David for this, but it turns out OK in the end because she eventually gives birth to Solomon a great king of Israel.This movie goes beyond the often told story of David and Goliath. In fact this movie sort of glosses over this story and moves into his life running from Saul. The movie showed David in a different light and one I have seen him in for a long time. I had forgotten that he had more than 5 wives! I had forgotten that he danced in the streets when he was proclaimed king.Richard Gere does a very good job with playing King David.

209757,A141HP4LYPWMSR,6300213927,Brian E. Erland,"[3, 4]","Synopsis: *See Hebrew Scriptures.Critique: The '85 Biblical drama `King David' was a film with a lot of potential that unfortunately goes for the most part unrealized. Much like a tapestry, a film is comprised of many parts (cast, crew, production values, script, soundtrack, etc.) that must be meticulously woven into one flowing, indivisible garment if the director's vision is to be realized and the film successful with its target audience. So, where did this film fall short of my expectations?Negatives:1- While I'm usually a fan of Richard Gere I found his portrayal of David to be lackluster and totally unmotivated. I'm guessing he was attempting to appear righteous and contemplative but it comes across as bored and disinterested.2- The editing is choppy and moves too abruptly. I found this lack of continuity to be disconcerting causing me to frequently lose focus and eventually interest in the ongoing storyline.3- The intermittent narration used to fill in the missing pieces of the story and pertinent scripture verses gave the film a Sunday School feel that I didn't care for.4- I think what bothered me the most was the total lack of passion in this production. There were no peak experiences, what I like to call ""I'm Spartacus"" moments that would set the film apart from others within the Biblical/religious genre.Positives:1- Excellent performance by Edward Woodward in the role of King Saul.2- A surprisingly insightful ongoing monologue from David to God provides a unique look at the thought processes of this legendary Biblical figure.Rating: If you like Biblically based films you'll probably enjoy this one well enough, but overall `King David' could have been much better; -3 1/2 Stars-.",3,"""In Our Country Madmen Are Held To Be Sacred"" ~ Madman, Poet And King",1210118400,"05 7, 2008",2008,1716,"['Synopsis', '*See', 'Hebrew', 'Scriptures.Critique', ""'85"", 'Biblical', 'drama', 'King', 'David', 'was', 'film', 'lot', 'potential', 'unfortunately', 'most', 'part', 'unrealized', 'Much', 'tapestry', 'film', 'comprised', 'many', 'parts', 'cast', 'crew', 'production', 'values', 'script', 'soundtrack', 'etc', 'must', 'be', 'meticulously', 'woven', 'one', 'flowing', 'indivisible', 'garment', 'director', 'vision', 'be', 'realized', 'film', 'successful', 'target', 'audience', 'So', 'where', 'did', 'film', 'fall', 'short', 'expectations', 'Negatives:1-', ""'m"", 'usually', 'fan', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'found', 'portrayal', 'David', 'be', 'lackluster', 'totally', 'unmotivated', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'was', 'attempting', 'appear', 'righteous', 'contemplative', 'bored', 'disinterested.2-', 'editing', 'choppy', 'moves', 'too', 'abruptly', 'found', 'lack', 'continuity', 'be', 'disconcerting', 'causing', 'frequently', 'lose', 'focus', 'eventually', 'interest', 'ongoing', 'storyline.3-', 'intermittent', 'narration', 'used', 'fill', 'missing', 'pieces', 'story', 'pertinent', 'scripture', 'verses', 'gave', 'film', 'Sunday', 'School', 'feel', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'for.4-', 'think', 'what', 'bothered', 'most', 'was', 'total', 'lack', 'passion', 'production', 'were', 'peak', 'experiences', 'what', 'like', 'call', ""'m"", 'Spartacus', 'moments', 'would', 'set', 'film', 'apart', 'others', 'Biblical/religious', 'genre.Positives:1-', 'Excellent', 'performance', 'Edward', 'Woodward', 'role', 'King', 'Saul.2-', 'A', 'surprisingly', 'insightful', 'ongoing', 'monologue', 'David', 'God', 'unique', 'look', 'thought', 'processes', 'legendary', 'Biblical', 'figure.Rating', 'like', 'Biblically', 'based', 'films', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'one', 'well', 'enough', 'overall', 'King', 'David', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', '1/2', 'Stars-']",King David VHS

There is a beheading, and a short shot of female nudity with David in bed with his wife.This movie is acceptably accurate towards scripture.

In the process it deals with the dangerous fanatics of the time like the ""prophet"" Samuel who disapproved firstly of the appointment of any king since that would take away power from him and from the priesthood (the official excuse being that it would be offensive since god is the only ""king""), and of King Saul for ""daring"" to go against the vengeful Yahweh and negotiate a peace treaty with enemies as well as kill only the men and keep women and children as slaves, when according to Yahweh all ""heathens"" must be put to the sword and/or decapitated.  Lovely...The film does a great job of describing life during the 10th century BC in Canaan, as well as the superstition, the fanaticism, and the fundamentalism that were so prevalent.In addition, there is a very good portrayal of Saul as a weak king, constantly undermined by the priesthood and unable to unite the people behind him.Conflicts, disputes, feuds, and back stabbings are all about.What I found especially interesting is how brutal and exclusive they were (something which for years has been purposely hidden).  So well done to this film for doing the obvious i.e. accurately presenting what one really encounters in the Old Testament for a change instead of all these inaccurate happy-happy films that we are so used to seeing.Richard Gere, Edward Woodward, Alice Krige, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!

209785,A220FJEQNGMSRN,6300213927,Trevor Willsmer,"[4, 6]","King David was the Alexander of its day, a critically reviled epic that was damned more for what it got right than what it gets wrong. Critics at the time were aghast at the violence and ridiculed the scene where Richard Gere dances through the streets of Jerusalem in a loincloth, but in actuality both are straight from the Book of Kings and are considerably watered down: this David doesn't give his father-in-law hundreds of Philistines foreskins in return for the hand of his daughter, and the decimation of his enemies takes place safely offscreen. But the film's attitude to religion is strikingly grim. This isn't the cosy feelgood God of Sunday school but a vengeful, unforgiving God who orders genocide and abandons those He anoints. Both Saul and David fall from Grace, but strangely enough it's Saul's fall that really registers. Edward Woodward is superb in the role, and all too easily dominates the film in the face of little competition from some especially bland British and Irish actors.Gere should be ideal casting for David's vanity at least, but he's a transparent presence in the film, lacking depth and over-reliant on his limited range of affectations. But he's not helped by the fact that David never becomes a character or even an active participant in his own life story: if anything, he is almost a bystander observing the deeds of others. After slaying Goliath, we never see him in battle or earning his reputation as a great king, and he doesn't feature in either of the two underwhelming battle scenes, a problem highlighted by intercutting them with shots of David miles away waiting to hear the result. As an epic, it's desperately underpopulated (they had major problems getting enough extras to the Italian locations), and you get the feeling at time that it's almost a picture made up of leftovers - the costumes were originally made for Scorsese's first abortive attempt to film The Last Temptation while the Ark of the Covenant probably has `Property of Indiana Jones' stamped inside itSomewhere in there there's an idea fighting to get out about the search for God, but unfortunately it's so low-key and evenly paced that there are no real highs to the film. Carl Davis' score has its moments and it's not the turkey its reputation implies, but it never catches fire. As Bruce Beresford noted, they should have taken the hint when they started shooting in Israel only to get caught up in snowstorms - someone was definitely trying to tell them something!The 2.35:1 DVD transfer is acceptable but not outstanding, although there are no extras.",3,Saul steals the movie from David,1130544000,"10 29, 2005",2005,2581,"['King', 'David', 'was', 'Alexander', 'day', 'critically', 'reviled', 'epic', 'was', 'damned', 'more', 'what', 'got', 'right', 'what', 'wrong', 'Critics', 'time', 'were', 'aghast', 'violence', 'ridiculed', 'scene', 'where', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'streets', 'Jerusalem', 'loincloth', 'actuality', 'are', 'straight', 'Book', 'Kings', 'are', 'considerably', 'watered', 'down', 'David', ""n't"", 'give', 'father-in-law', 'hundreds', 'Philistines', 'foreskins', 'return', 'hand', 'daughter', 'decimation', 'enemies', 'place', 'safely', 'offscreen', 'film', 'attitude', 'religion', 'strikingly', 'grim', ""n't"", 'cosy', 'feelgood', 'God', 'Sunday', 'school', 'vengeful', 'unforgiving', 'God', 'who', 'orders', 'genocide', 'abandons', 'Saul', 'David', 'fall', 'Grace', 'strangely', 'Saul', 'fall', 'really', 'registers', 'Edward', 'Woodward', 'superb', 'role', 'too', 'easily', 'film', 'face', 'little', 'competition', 'especially', 'bland', 'British', 'Irish', 'actors.Gere', 'should', 'be', 'ideal', 'casting', 'David', 'vanity', 'least', 'transparent', 'presence', 'film', 'lacking', 'depth', 'over-reliant', 'limited', 'range', 'affectations', 'not', 'helped', 'fact', 'David', 'never', 'character', 'even', 'active', 'participant', 'own', 'life', 'story', 'anything', 'almost', 'bystander', 'observing', 'deeds', 'others', 'slaying', 'Goliath', 'never', 'see', 'battle', 'earning', 'reputation', 'great', 'king', ""n't"", 'feature', 'two', 'underwhelming', 'battle', 'scenes', 'problem', 'highlighted', 'intercutting', 'shots', 'David', 'miles', 'away', 'waiting', 'hear', 'result', 'epic', 'desperately', 'underpopulated', 'had', 'major', 'problems', 'getting', 'enough', 'extras', 'Italian', 'locations', 'get', 'feeling', 'time', 'almost', 'picture', 'made', 'leftovers', 'costumes', 'were', 'originally', 'made', 'Scorsese', 'first', 'abortive', 'attempt', 'film', 'Last', 'Temptation', 'Ark', 'Covenant', 'probably', 'Property', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'stamped', 'itSomewhere', 'idea', 'fighting', 'get', 'out', 'search', 'God', 'unfortunately', 'so', 'low-key', 'evenly', 'paced', 'are', 'real', 'highs', 'film', 'Carl', 'Davis', 'score', 'moments', 'not', 'turkey', 'reputation', 'implies', 'never', 'fire', 'Bruce', 'Beresford', 'noted', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'hint', 'when', 'started', 'shooting', 'Israel', 'only', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'snowstorms', 'someone', 'was', 'definitely', 'trying', 'tell', 'something', '2.35:1', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'acceptable', 'not', 'outstanding', 'are', 'extras']",King David VHS

209788,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,6300213927,Wuchak,"[1, 2]","David is hands-down my favorite Biblical character (aside from JC himself, of Course). I never tire of reading and studying the events of his life -- the trials & perseverances, the agonies & ecstasies, the successes and failures (man, that sounds hokey, huh?).Well, 1985's ""King David,"" starring Richard Gere in the titular role, essentially covers IT ALL. That's right, you'll see all the following events covered in the picture:-- Samuel's choosing of David as successor to King Saul-- Israel's battles with the Philistines-- The challenge of the hulk Goliath and David's victory with a sling shot-- David playing his harp to soothe Saul's torment-- Saul's increasing jealousy and hatred of David-- David & Jonathan's brotherly love-- David's wandering in the wilderness with his men, fleeing Saul-- David's stealing Saul's spear while he sleeps in a cave, sparing him-- Saul's suicide-- David dancing in his skivvies when the Ark is brought into Jerusalem-- Michal's love and, later, hatred of David (as he dances before the LORD)-- David secretly ogling hottie Bathsheba bathing from his palace roof and the ensuing adultery-- David's murder of Uriah (Bathsheba's husband) and Nathan's rebuke-- Amnon's rape of his half-sister Tamar-- Absalom's justified slaying of half-brother Amnon-- Absalom's stealing of the Israelite's hearts-- Absalom's death and David's grievingWHAT WORKS:-- The film is very worthwhile if you desire to see these numerous events depicted before your very eyes.-- The cast, sets, costumes, locations and filmmaking are all of the highest order for 1985.-- Edward Woodward is excellent as the jealous and bitter King Saul, even though he lacks Saul's heighth (as he was a whole head taller than any other Israelite).-- Most aspects of the David/Goliath challenge are great; for instance, the troops shown on two separate hills.-- Alice Krige is truly beautiful as Bathsheba. Along the same lines, the woman who plays Michal is very good and possesses a very unique beauty.WHAT DOESN'T WORK:-- Despite the numerous events covered in David's life, the film only runs 1 hour and 51 minutes before the closing credits. Let's face it, there's at least 3 hours of material here. Condensing it down to less than 2 hours prevents the viewer from being captivated by the myriad characters and events. The viewer is left struggling to connect with the people and their stories.-- Despite the numerous events flying by, the film has a bit of a lazy vibe. There's very little spectacle like ""The Ten Commandments"" or ""Ben-Hur.""-- David was a very passionate man -- a ""man after God's own heart."" Gere is fine for this role (the Bible explicitly states that David was a ruddy and handsome man) but he plays the character a bit overly righteous, pensive and noble, hence, David never fully comes alive to the viewer. Please notice I said ""a bit"" and ""never FULLY comes alive."" In other words, Gere is quite decent in the role. In fact, the failures may be the writers' fault.-- When the boy David takes on Goliath there's zero passion and righteous ferocity as is in the Biblical account (e.g. ""Who is this uncircumcized Philistine who would defy the armies of the living God?!!""). Plus the film doesn't show the serious trash-talking that went back and forth between the two. The fight's just too low key.Although the gist of the story is accurate there are inaccuracies that some could nitpick, e.g. Goliath challenged David and the Israelites himself, he didn't speak through another man; David picked up stones before going out to fight the giant, not while fighting him; Absalom waited a long time before slaying Amnon, he didn't do it immediately; etc. Changes like these aren't that big of a deal and won't ruin your viewing experience unless you're completely [...] about it (sorry for my crudeness).One reviewer criticized the film for showing Bathsheba at fault for seducing David. Actually, they both share fault equally. Everyone in Jerusalem knew the king stayed home while the troops were out fighting, so Bathsheba was likely fully aware that the king could catch a real nice tantalizing glimpse of her while she was bathing. Besides, even though David was the king, she could have said 'no' when the proposition of adultery later presented itself. In other words, she was both into it and into David.FINAL ANALYSIS: I've seen ""King David"" 3 times now and enjoy it every time. It's a very worthwhile and well-done film account of David's life. Unfortunately the picture cuts off way more than it can chew in a mere 1 hour and 51 minutes, leaving the viewer detached from the characters and events, in particular those who know little about the biblical account.Don't listen to those who absurdly rate the film less than 3/5 Stars. They're way off. Depending on your tastes, this is at least a 3/5 Star film. It's good (I give it a Grade of ""B""), it just lacks the oomph and detail to make it great.",4,Good but lacks the oomph & detail to make it great,1212796800,"06 7, 2008",2008,4928,"['David',
