What a wonderful job is done by Alan Arkin. In the beginning titles you see ""Introducing Sondra Locke."" I had no idea this was her first movie. It would not have otherwise been revealed by her acting.It is really worthwhile watching, I suppose even a second or third time. Alan Arkin's character portrayal of John Singer reveals much insightfulness and, let's say, an acquired compassion that can be mysteriously connected with living in our world without the gift of speech or hearing--or maybe it's simply or possibly the revelation of the ""heart"" or the ""goodness"" that can be found in such a person. This is also contrasted with the extreme loneliness that can exist concurrently.

A pity Locke was never given roles this meaty since then. Percy Rodriguez also is memorable here.Since this is good storytelling, from a best-selling book by Carson McCullers, all the characters here stand out. It's not a fast-moving film yet it is an involving story in which the viewer winds up caring about these people.

234936,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6300269485,David Baldwin,"[3, 6]","I've never read Carson McCullers' source novel but judging by this film it must be a tough translation.  A lot of Alan Arkin's work as John Singer, a deaf mute, requires him to externalize his internal pain through facial expressions and hand gestures.  That's a tall order for any actor and Arkin is among our best but somehow I think the film falls short.  Not in the perjorative sense, but with Singer's seersucker suit and crewcut and his humanitarianism I was reminded of a yesteryear Forrest Gump.  Sondra Locke is a revelation as Mick, the daughter of Singer's landlady.  Mick is a dreamer who wants to break free, as would any adolescent, from the rigidity of her surroundings.  Singer, whose prison is the handicap he is saddled with, developes an obvious kinship with Mick.  Locke is best known for her work in Clint Eastwood films, who she developed an offscreen love affair with.  I can't help but wonder whether that relationship stunted Locke's growth in films.  The film, set in the South in the late sixties, tackles issues of racism and bigotry but in nothing more than a perfunctory way.

234945,A1HHY7EFRT2KGQ,6300269485,"klavierspiel ""klavierspiel""","[3, 3]","Carson McCullers' first published novel instantly established her as a major American writer. Re-reading the novel it is still easy to see why--individual characters vivid in their lonely aspirations and unfulfilled yearning are set with total conviction against a deft portrayal of societal and racial tensions in a small Southern town in the 1930s.The 1968 filming of The Heart is a Lonely Hunter could not have hoped to capture all of the elements of McCullers' frequently sprawling saga. However, viewing it today one is struck by how much has been pared away, not to the film's advantage. While the action still centers around John Singer, the deaf-mute who loses his best friend, and Mick, the gawky teenager reaching out for something beyond her prosaic existence, many of the other characters who stand out so vividly in the novel have been cut adrift or reduced almost to non-existence. In particular, Jake Blount, the drunken, politically radicalized drifter, and Portia, the embittered daughter of the rigid Dr. Copeland, are little more than ciphers as scripted. This is more the pity because actors of the stature of Stacy Keach and Cicely Tyson are thereby wasted, though they do their best with the material they have. Percy Rodriguez, as the black doctor, comes off better, and Sondra Locke as Mick (though she is noticeably too mature for the part) and Alan Arkin in the pivotal role of Singer are best of all, and certainly deserved their Oscar nominations. One can argue nowadays about the ethics of casting a hearing actor in a deaf role (particularly after a brilliant screen presence such as Marlee Matlin), but Arkin is totally convincing and immensely touching, at least to this hearing viewer.They are saddled with a script that too often reduces McCullers' poetic language to TV-level clich&eacute;s, and direction that is at best workmanlike. Only a few scenes, such as Mick's awkward, unsatisfying sexual awakening, and an ugly racial fight at a carnival, retain anything approaching the novel's evocative power. Still, the work of this fine cast makes this one still worth a look today.",3,Pedestrian adaptation of McCullers masterpiece--but the actors soar,1276560000,"06 15, 2010",2010,2115,"['Carson', 'McCullers', 'first', 'published', 'novel', 'instantly', 'established', 'major', 'American', 'writer', 'Re-reading', 'novel', 'still', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'individual', 'characters', 'vivid', 'lonely', 'aspirations', 'unfulfilled', 'yearning', 'are', 'set', 'total', 'conviction', 'deft', 'portrayal', 'societal', 'racial', 'tensions', 'small', 'Southern', 'town', '1930s.The', '1968', 'filming', 'Heart', 'Lonely', 'Hunter', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'hoped', 'capture', 'elements', 'McCullers', 'frequently', 'sprawling', 'saga', 'However', 'viewing', 'today', 'one', 'struck', 'how', 'much', 'been', 'pared', 'away', 'not', 'film', 'advantage', 'action', 'still', 'John', 'Singer', 'deaf-mute', 'who', 'best', 'friend', 'Mick', 'gawky', 'teenager', 'reaching', 'out', 'something', 'prosaic', 'existence', 'many', 'other', 'characters', 'who', 'stand', 'out', 'so', 'vividly', 'novel', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'adrift', 'reduced', 'almost', 'non-existence', 'particular', 'Jake', 'Blount', 'drunken', 'politically', 'radicalized', 'drifter', 'Portia', 'embittered', 'daughter', 'rigid', 'Dr.', 'Copeland', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'ciphers', 'scripted', 'more', 'pity', 'actors', 'stature', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', 'are', 'thereby', 'wasted', 'do', 'best', 'material', 'have', 'Percy', 'Rodriguez', 'black', 'doctor', 'off', 'better', 'Sondra', 'Locke', 'Mick', 'noticeably', 'too', 'mature', 'part', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'pivotal', 'role', 'Singer', 'are', 'best', 'certainly', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'One', 'can', 'argue', 'nowadays', 'ethics', 'casting', 'hearing', 'actor', 'deaf', 'role', 'particularly', 'brilliant', 'screen', 'presence', 'such', 'Marlee', 'Matlin', 'Arkin', 'totally', 'convincing', 'immensely', 'touching', 'least', 'hearing', 'viewer.They', 'are', 'saddled', 'script', 'too', 'often', 'McCullers', 'poetic', 'language', 'TV-level', 'clich', 'eacute', 'direction', 'best', 'workmanlike', 'Only', 'few', 'scenes', 'such', 'Mick', 'awkward', 'unsatisfying', 'sexual', 'awakening', 'ugly', 'racial', 'fight', 'carnival', 'retain', 'anything', 'approaching', 'novel', 'evocative', 'power', 'Still', 'work', 'fine', 'cast', 'one', 'still', 'look', 'today']",Heart Is a Lonely Hunter VHS

234949,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,6300269485,Linda Linguvic,"[28, 37]","This 1968 film is based on the book by Carson McCullers.  The basic story is still there, which is that of a deaf mute who helps people but somehow cannot help himself. But a lot is missing.  Alan Arkin, then 34 years old, plays the deaf mute and does a masterful job.  Sondra Locke plays a teenage girl whose family rents a room to Arkin, Stacy Keach plays a drunk.  And Cecily Tyson plays the angry grown daughter of the Afro-American physician played by Percy Rodriguez.  All are excellent in their roles.The film is about loneliness in all its forms and is sometimes too sentimental and slow.  I understand that the story lines had to be changed in order to fit it all into a screenplay, but the result is an over-simplification of the complex novel. Without the richness of language and depth of characterization of the book, the film is a mere shadow of what I would have liked it to be.

John Singer (Arkin) is a deaf-mute who works in a small town jewelry store doing engraving and repairs. He also apparently has responsibility for another deaf-mute, Spiros(Chuck McCann) who continually gets into trouble with the law and is sent away to a 'facility' in another small community. Singer moves there to be close and help his friend. He rents a room from a family struggling with finances due to the father's hip injury and inability to work. He enters into the life of the teenage daughter struggling with her identity and coming of age. His disability makes him very sensitive to the needs and hurts of those around him including an African-American doctor who refuses to treat whites. While selflessly reaching out to those around him, Singer harbors a secret known only to himself.

That brightness, along with the almost cheery tone in much of the acting (Chuck McCann, Sondra Locke, etc.) seem at odds with the bleakness of the material ... until, on second thought, it seems like the perfect metaphor for how the world viewed Singer, all cheerful surface. The cinematography intentionally ignores the sadness and the darkness inside these superficially cheery lives, just as everyone ignored Singer's feelings. (Only Cicely Tyson's intense performance goes straight for the dark side in this material which, in fact, makes her seem the most out-of-place member of the cast.) On a different note: I really adored Sondra Locke here. She makes a debut with a charm similar to that of Reese Witherspoon's in Man in the Moon. Since I am also a big fan of Clint Eastwood's under-rated The Gauntlet (an homage to Don Siegel that is also the first hint of Eastwood's later mastery as a director), I have to say that Sondra Locke deserves to be more than a footnote in cinema history.

One thing that I saw that was significant that all the reviews to date missed with the fact that John Singer had really only one friend whom brought him joy and confort.  This movie builds from Singer's desire to be near his friend, who is mentally challenged, mute and hospital bound.In Singer's quest to be with his only friend, his path crosses with others whom he is able to help, one way or another as they deal with their problems; one is a black doctor who hates whites, disapproves of the man his daughter marries and her employment (this movie takes place during the Civil Rights Era), the life of one teenager who is not a girl, not yet a woman, a brief crossing with a man who is drunk but he befriends and finally the lives of the doctor's daughter who becomes enbittered toward her father.  All of these people's find comfort from Singer but are unable to return it, partly because of the communication gap and partly because of their own problems.  The centerpiece in Singer's life that brings him the comfort and satisfaction he needs comes from his friend in the hospital.  While this aspect of the film does not get a great deal  of film time, the lack thereof cannot take away the significance of it in the life of Singer whom which others find comfort in all the while he is living in lonely isolation.Don't look for a happy ending here, this movie is about life in a real world.  Be it fictional or not, life does not always afford us a happy resolution to everything.... or at least when we would like it to.One drawback about this movie that may necessitate reading the book is the lack of captions for when Singer was communicating, especially with his friend.

That seems to be the case with ""The Heart is a Lonely Hunter"", which like a number of films from the late 60's, suffers from a case of over-earnestness.Still, though it is overbusy trying to crowd in themes of racial strife and teenage heartache and loses a little of its focus on the claustrophobic life of a deaf-mute, it remains a worthwhile movie.That is because good performances from Alan Arkin, Stacy Keach, Sondra Locke and Chuck McCann bring a lot of life to what could have been a very formulaic setting of a Southern Gothic novel.Much credit should also be given to the camerawork of James Wong Howe, who also filmed two other good American period pieces, ""Picnic"" and ""This Property Is Condemned"".  Howe seemed to have a knack for capturing essences of small town life in bright, clear colors.Director Robert Ellis Miller isn't really known for films as much as for television direction.  That may be why the movie, while it remains a charming relic, never attained the classic status of other late 60's films like ""In The Heat of the Night"" and ""Bonnie and Clyde"".

I am familiar with the work of Carson McCullers, and her narratives are thoroughly character-driven. However, she does center her material on one character (as in ""The Member of the Wedding""). In this case, it's an incredible man named John Singer, masterfully portrayed by the great Alan Arkin. Certainly, most books need to be ""abbreviated"" in their transfer to the screen. (""Tom Jones"" comes to mind, a huge sprawling Henry Fielding novel, concisely brought to the screen). I have read ALL the previous reviews, and pitiably lament that I hadn't read Ms. McCuller's novel. Still, I feel that John Singer's integrity, loneliness and pain, not to mention his frustration, was so brilliantly conveyed by Arkin. Sondra Locke was nominated for an Oscar for this, critics comparing her to Julie Harris in ""Member of the Wedding"". It's an auspicious debut, but it is Cecily Tyson who deserved that nomination. Outstanding performances from Chuck McCann, Percy Rodriguez and Stacy Keach were wonderful and complete; having not read the book, I knew everything I needed to know about these characters, as a viewer. This simple film from 1968 could certainly benefit from a ""re-telling"" as a mini-series or HBO film. Perhaps, the lovers of the book would be sated (and maybe not). Until then, I'm happy to know that this story is captured on film, as well as Arkin's great performance. (Arkin lost the Oscar to Cliff Robertson in ""Charly"", another disabled character).I'm thinking Warner Brothers would do themselves proud to issue a DVD, since Arkin's still around, as well as Locke, Tyson and a few others. I'm also sorry to say that I'm not familiar with the work of director Robert Ellis Miller, but he's made a film that touched me profoundly, with every imaginable portrayal of prejudice and mistrust, all portrayed by ""good, righteous"" people. I admire this film very much. Please, Warner Brothers...where's the DVD?  UPDATE: I'm thrilled that the DVD is coming out in January, '08. Can't wait. UPDATE: I have the DVD and it's fine, but no extras. Some interviews with Arkin or Locke would've been interesting, since it's an important film in their list of career achievements. I still haven't read the book, but the elements of that book that are here create a fine film by itself. I forgot how good Laurinda Barrett was as the mother, as was the boy who played Mick's brother. He was a real natural.",5,Finally the DVD?,1104192000,"12 28, 2004",2004,2443,"[""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'am', 'familiar', 'work', 'Carson', 'McCullers', 'narratives', 'are', 'thoroughly', 'character-driven', 'However', 'center', 'material', 'one', 'character', 'Member', 'Wedding', 'case', 'incredible', 'man', 'named', 'John', 'Singer', 'masterfully', 'portrayed', 'great', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Certainly', 'most', 'books', 'need', 'be', 'abbreviated', 'transfer', 'screen', 'Tom', 'Jones', 'mind', 'huge', 'sprawling', 'Henry', 'Fielding', 'novel', 'concisely', 'brought', 'screen', 'have', 'read', 'previous', 'reviews', 'pitiably', 'lament', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'Ms.', 'McCuller', 'novel', 'Still', 'feel', 'John', 'Singer', 'integrity', 'loneliness', 'pain', 'not', 'mention', 'frustration', 'was', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'conveyed', 'Arkin', 'Sondra', 'Locke', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'critics', 'comparing', 'Julie', 'Harris', 'Member', 'Wedding', 'auspicious', 'debut', 'Cecily', 'Tyson', 'who', 'deserved', 'nomination', 'Outstanding', 'performances', 'Chuck', 'McCann', 'Percy', 'Rodriguez', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'were', 'wonderful', 'complete', 'having', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'knew', 'everything', 'needed', 'know', 'characters', 'viewer', 'simple', 'film', '1968', 'could', 'certainly', 'benefit', 're-telling', 'mini-series', 'HBO', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'lovers', 'book', 'would', 'be', 'sated', 'maybe', 'not', 'then', ""'m"", 'happy', 'know', 'story', 'captured', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'Arkin', 'great', 'performance', 'Arkin', 'lost', 'Oscar', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'Charly', 'disabled', 'character', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'would', 'do', 'proud', 'issue', 'DVD', 'Arkin', 'still', 'around', 'as', 'well', 'Locke', 'Tyson', 'few', 'others', ""'m"", 'also', 'sorry', 'say', ""'m"", 'not', 'familiar', 'work', 'director', 'Robert', 'Ellis', 'Miller', 'made', 'film', 'touched', 'profoundly', 'imaginable', 'portrayal', 'prejudice', 'mistrust', 'portrayed', 'good', 'righteous', 'people', 'admire', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'Please', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'where', 'DVD', 'UPDATE', ""'m"", 'thrilled', 'DVD', 'coming', 'out', 'January', ""'08"", 'Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'UPDATE', 'have', 'DVD', 'fine', 'extras', 'interviews', 'Arkin', 'Locke', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'interesting', 'important', 'film', 'list', 'career', 'achievements', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'elements', 'book', 'are', 'here', 'create', 'fine', 'film', 'forgot', 'how', 'good', 'Laurinda', 'Barrett', 'was', 'mother', 'was', 'boy', 'who', 'played', 'Mick', 'brother', 'was', 'real', 'natural']",Heart Is a Lonely Hunter VHS

234963,A6FIAB28IS79,6300269485,Samuel Chell,"[37, 40]","No, it's not the novel, which is a multi-plotted study of four characters whose lives are symmetrically developed and eventually tied together like the themes in a sonata, all of them linked by their attraction to a deaf-mute as an alternative to a profound sense of futility, despair and, above all, loneliness felt by each of the four.  The ultimate irony is that the only character who affords the others a solace from their alienation is himself the most isolated and miserable character in the story, denied even an illusory companionship when his only friend dies.The film omits much of the confused and failed political agendas of the black Southern doctor (Dr. Copeland) and the inarticulate Marx idealogist (Jake Blount) as well as the antisocial preoccupations of the novel's unlikely, voyeuristic hero, the restaurant owner, Biff Brannon.  But by focusing on the struggles of the deaf-mute (Alan Arkin) and the idealistic young woman seeking to escape from oppressive social circumstances (Sondra Locke), it accomplishes more than many films.  In fact, I can think of few movies that so effectively represent life in a small-minded, provincial Southern community: a form of American pastoral that is also a microcosm of life--from racial and social prejudice to economic hardship to dreams of personal freedom and achievement to the universality of the loneliness that paradoxically joins and separates the often dysfunctional family of humanity.This is a film with a lot of heart, one moreover that's capable of gettihg under your  skin and leaving a lasting impression much like McCullers' writing.  Its strengths are more likely to be apparent to someone who sees the movie before reading the novel that inspired it.  Most importantly, despite simplifying, sentimentalizing, and ""sanitizing"" the original novel considerably, this is not the kind of film present-day Hollywood would risk an investment on.  It retains far too many of the themes, realistic portrayals and aesthetic elements of serious, non-escapist literary art to be seen as a viable property for a popular and commercially successful movie, or even as a candidate for a DVD transfer.",5,American Pastoral: captures the spirit of McCullers' poetic study of loneliness,1152489600,"07 10, 2006",2006,2164,"['not', 'novel', 'multi-plotted', 'study', 'four', 'characters', 'lives', 'are', 'symmetrically', 'developed', 'eventually', 'tied', 'together', 'themes', 'sonata', 'linked', 'attraction', 'deaf-mute', 'alternative', 'profound', 'sense', 'futility', 'despair', 'loneliness', 'felt', 'four', 'ultimate', 'irony', 'only', 'character', 'who', 'others', 'solace', 'alienation', 'most', 'isolated', 'miserable', 'character', 'story', 'denied', 'even', 'illusory', 'companionship', 'when', 'only', 'friend', 'dies.The', 'film', 'much', 'confused', 'failed', 'political', 'agendas', 'black', 'Southern', 'doctor', 'Dr.', 'Copeland', 'inarticulate', 'Marx', 'idealogist', 'Jake', 'Blount', 'as', 'well', 'antisocial', 'preoccupations', 'novel', 'unlikely', 'voyeuristic', 'hero', 'restaurant', 'owner', 'Biff', 'Brannon', 'focusing', 'struggles', 'deaf-mute', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'idealistic', 'young', 'woman', 'seeking', 'escape', 'oppressive', 'social', 'circumstances', 'Sondra', 'Locke', 'more', 'many', 'films', 'fact', 'can', 'think', 'few', 'movies', 'so', 'effectively', 'represent', 'life', 'small-minded', 'provincial', 'Southern', 'community', 'form', 'American', 'pastoral', 'also', 'microcosm', 'life', 'racial', 'social', 'prejudice', 'economic', 'hardship', 'dreams', 'personal', 'freedom', 'achievement', 'universality', 'loneliness', 'paradoxically', 'often', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'humanity.This', 'film', 'lot', 'heart', 'one', 'moreover', 'capable', 'gettihg', 'skin', 'leaving', 'lasting', 'impression', 'much', 'McCullers', 'writing', 'strengths', 'are', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'apparent', 'someone', 'who', 'movie', 'reading', 'novel', 'inspired', 'Most', 'importantly', 'simplifying', 'sentimentalizing', 'sanitizing', 'original', 'novel', 'considerably', 'not', 'kind', 'film', 'present-day', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'risk', 'investment', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'themes', 'realistic', 'portrayals', 'aesthetic', 'elements', 'serious', 'non-escapist', 'literary', 'art', 'be', 'seen', 'viable', 'property', 'popular', 'commercially', 'successful', 'movie', 'even', 'candidate', 'DVD', 'transfer']",Heart Is a Lonely Hunter VHS
