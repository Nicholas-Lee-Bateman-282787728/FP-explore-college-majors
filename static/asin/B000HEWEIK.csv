1014440,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000HEWEIK,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[6, 34]","When one chooses to pick up a ""comedy"" video, one hopes that laughter would be the only element pushed.  One would also hope that if it were a variety program such as this, that the host would further gel everything together providing us with even more laughter and moments of enjoyment.  That is not the case with Thou Shalt Laugh.  Everything, I repeat, everything was placed in a bizarro blender and cheaply served on paper plates.  The humor, from every comedian that decided to walk upon the stage, was horrid.  I found myself laughing at none of the jokes -- I was unable to relate (spiritually or otherwise) to the entire gist of the program.  I was at a loss with the cheap designs, the ill planned introductions by Heaton (who obviously read the cue cards and collected her paycheck), and the boredom felt by both the audience and performers.  Michael Jr. is a prime example of feeling out of place, giving us a feeling of being out of place, and how the camera just seemed to linger on him even further ... thus leading further into the errors of this program.  Fairness.Fairness needs to be present when doing a film of this nature.  The audience will respect the program further if each comic has the same amount of time and material.  To me, and probably to others, it looks bad when one comic is allowed twenty minutes, while the next is only allowed five.  Obviously director Cooke saw that the talent wasn't as strong as he liked so he cut others off, while demonstrating favoritism to the others.  Boasting the next Blue Collar crew, Cooke tries -- too hard -- to reenact that same environment and sensation, but instead of transforming a bunch of unknowns into superstardom, he falls flat on his face.  What made Blue Collar work was the fact that it was headlined by one already established comedian, and then two (JUST TWO) smaller ones.  That allowed us to get to know the comedians, to get comfortable with their rhythm and style, before making a judgment.  Alas, that was not the case here.  The viewers are bombarded with one comedian after the next without any sign of acceptance or enjoyment.  Sure, there are the clich&eacute; images of those viewers laughing, but Cooke tries to out do us yet again by only showing the same three people in a nonconsecutive loop.  Eventually, I found myself smiling at the fact that I recognized the same old audience members, and felt more of a connection to them than to the actual comedians.  Again, this was just another breaking point to an already blunderous ordeal.I think where this film utterly failed was that it boasted the greatest and sub-performed with the follow-through.  One of the taglines to this film was, ""seven of the funniest Christian comedians on Earth"", so with that said, laughter was to follow.  Blue Collar was funny because a full range of audience members could relate.  If you were not a redneck, sipping your Miller Lite from a koozie with your favorite Segar album boldly printed on the foam, than you at least knew someone that fit the mold.  That element is where Thou Shalt Laugh missed the mark.  It didn't appeal to a general audience.  There was no profanity in the delivery of the jokes, the overall tone of the film was G at best, but there just seemed to be something lacking.  From a puzzle perspective, things didn't fit together at all from the beginning to end.  The host was a distraction from the main attraction which boasted big stars of which could not deliver.  It was sad moment for Christian comedy, not because they didn't try (because they did), but because it was horribly constructed, falsely delivered, and held together with the worst cohesiveness possible, unfunny jokes.Overall, anyone can tell a clean joke - but should they be considered a Christian comedian?  I think these comedians could have taken it to the next level, but instead (staying on par with the theme of the film), they performed below average and watched as unsuspecting audience members uttered forced laughter and painful responses.  Nothing in this direct-to-video release worked.  Heaton was a waste of money and talent, Cooke's direction was horrid - almost to the point of ""home-movie-ish"", and the comedians - as I repeat again - just were not funny.  I would think that would need to be a big element to this film, but alas, it was not.  I do not suggest this film to anyone, unless you are in desperate need of a good night's sleep.  I applaud Christian comics, but I believe what was demonstrated here was utter blasphemy.Grade: * out of *****",1,"Honestly, was this one of the original commandments?",1170720000,"02 6, 2007",2007,4546,"['When', 'one', 'pick', 'up', 'comedy', 'video', 'one', 'laughter', 'would', 'be', 'only', 'element', 'pushed', 'One', 'would', 'also', 'hope', 'were', 'variety', 'program', 'such', 'host', 'would', 'further', 'gel', 'everything', 'together', 'providing', 'even', 'more', 'laughter', 'moments', 'enjoyment', 'not', 'case', 'Thou', 'Shalt', 'Laugh', 'Everything', 'repeat', 'everything', 'was', 'placed', 'bizarro', 'blender', 'cheaply', 'served', 'paper', 'plates', 'humor', 'comedian', 'decided', 'walk', 'stage', 'was', 'horrid', 'found', 'laughing', 'none', 'jokes', 'was', 'unable', 'relate', 'spiritually', 'otherwise', 'entire', 'gist', 'program', 'was', 'loss', 'cheap', 'designs', 'ill', 'planned', 'introductions', 'Heaton', 'who', 'obviously', 'read', 'cue', 'cards', 'collected', 'paycheck', 'boredom', 'felt', 'audience', 'performers', 'Michael', 'Jr.', 'prime', 'example', 'feeling', 'place', 'giving', 'feeling', 'being', 'place', 'how', 'camera', 'just', 'seemed', 'linger', 'even', 'further', 'thus', 'leading', 'further', 'errors', 'program', 'Fairness.Fairness', 'be', 'present', 'when', 'doing', 'film', 'nature', 'audience', 'will', 'respect', 'program', 'further', 'comic', 'same', 'amount', 'time', 'material', 'probably', 'others', 'bad', 'when', 'one', 'comic', 'allowed', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'next', 'only', 'allowed', 'five', 'Obviously', 'director', 'Cooke', 'saw', 'talent', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'strong', 'liked', 'so', 'cut', 'others', 'off', 'demonstrating', 'favoritism', 'others', 'Boasting', 'next', 'Blue', 'Collar', 'crew', 'Cooke', 'too', 'hard', 'reenact', 'same', 'environment', 'sensation', 'instead', 'transforming', 'bunch', 'unknowns', 'superstardom', 'flat', 'face', 'What', 'made', 'Blue', 'Collar', 'work', 'was', 'fact', 'was', 'headlined', 'one', 'already', 'established', 'comedian', 'then', 'two', 'JUST', 'TWO', 'smaller', 'ones', 'allowed', 'get', 'know', 'comedians', 'get', 'comfortable', 'rhythm', 'style', 'making', 'judgment', 'Alas', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'viewers', 'are', 'bombarded', 'one', 'comedian', 'next', 'sign', 'acceptance', 'enjoyment', 'Sure', 'are', 'clich', 'eacute', 'images', 'viewers', 'laughing', 'Cooke', 'tries', 'out', 'do', 'yet', 'again', 'only', 'showing', 'same', 'three', 'people', 'nonconsecutive', 'loop', 'Eventually', 'found', 'smiling', 'fact', 'recognized', 'same', 'old', 'audience', 'members', 'felt', 'more', 'connection', 'actual', 'comedians', 'Again', 'was', 'just', 'breaking', 'point', 'already', 'blunderous', 'ordeal.I', 'think', 'where', 'film', 'utterly', 'failed', 'was', 'boasted', 'greatest', 'sub-performed', 'follow-through', 'One', 'taglines', 'film', 'was', 'seven', 'funniest', 'Christian', 'comedians', 'Earth', 'so', 'said', 'laughter', 'was', 'follow', 'Blue', 'Collar', 'was', 'funny', 'full', 'range', 'audience', 'members', 'could', 'relate', 'were', 'not', 'redneck', 'sipping', 'Miller', 'Lite', 'koozie', 'favorite', 'Segar', 'album', 'boldly', 'printed', 'foam', 'least', 'knew', 'someone', 'fit', 'mold', 'element', 'where', 'Thou', 'Shalt', 'Laugh', 'missed', 'mark', 'did', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'general', 'audience', 'was', 'profanity', 'delivery', 'jokes', 'overall', 'tone', 'film', 'was', 'G', 'best', 'there', 'just', 'seemed', 'be', 'something', 'lacking', 'puzzle', 'perspective', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'together', 'beginning', 'end', 'host', 'was', 'distraction', 'main', 'attraction', 'boasted', 'big', 'stars', 'could', 'not', 'deliver', 'was', 'sad', 'moment', 'Christian', 'comedy', 'not', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'did', 'was', 'horribly', 'constructed', 'falsely', 'delivered', 'held', 'together', 'worst', 'cohesiveness', 'possible', 'unfunny', 'jokes.Overall', 'anyone', 'can', 'tell', 'clean', 'joke', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'Christian', 'comedian', 'think', 'comedians', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'next', 'level', 'instead', 'staying', 'par', 'theme', 'film', 'performed', 'average', 'watched', 'unsuspecting', 'audience', 'members', 'uttered', 'forced', 'laughter', 'painful', 'responses', 'Nothing', 'direct-to-video', 'release', 'worked', 'Heaton', 'was', 'waste', 'money', 'talent', 'Cooke', 'direction', 'was', 'horrid', 'almost', 'point', 'home-movie-ish', 'comedians', 'repeat', 'again', 'just', 'were', 'not', 'funny', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'need', 'be', 'big', 'element', 'film', 'alas', 'was', 'not', 'do', 'not', 'suggest', 'film', 'anyone', 'are', 'desperate', 'need', 'good', 'night', 'sleep', 'applaud', 'Christian', 'comics', 'believe', 'what', 'was', 'demonstrated', 'here', 'was', 'utter', 'blasphemy.Grade', '*', '*****']",Thou Shalt Laugh

1014448,A3S1YIQQW7AZO,B000HEWEIK,EMAN NEP,"[13, 18]","The main premise of this DVD is to show that ""Christians have a sense of humor"". In fact, you'll see something written to that effect on the front cover of the DVD case. Unfortunately, I didn't feel they accomplished their mission.HUMOR: I applaud the fact that the main feature of the DVD is clean. Some might disagree with how ""clean"" the content is, but more on that later.In my case, I got a few chuckles out of the 130 minute affair, at best. The first two comedians were pretty good, but not laugh-out-loud hilarious in my case.And I knew the only female comedian on there was going to suck when she starts off with the topic of ""weight"". Thankfully, that torture only lasted 5 minutes.There were a few good ones after that, but I can't remember who they are (hint hint: if they were REALLY good I'd remember who they were).Finally, the puppet guy at the end was undoubtedly talented, but you can only glean so much humor from repetitive phrases like ""I'm staring at the man"" and puppet back-talk.I did chuckle at the ""Yugo with me to the Fiesta"" joke, but that was mostly due to the unfortunate fact that I used to drive a Yugo (and yes, it is every bit as bad as everyone says it is!).CONTENT: If I had to give this DVD a content rating it'd be a toss up between G and PG. If you consider ""OMG"" as the Lord's name in vain, then it may offend you, but it's not like they say g****** (you know the word). As for the few sexual references, I felt they were done in a tasteful way. The only way one could see them as bad is if you have a dirty imagination. And by the way, ""breast"" is a Noun, a body part, not a dirty word.Honestly, I would have no problem sitting down with a group of people of any age and watching this.Overall it's an okay DVD. I have to admit that it was refreshing to see those in the audience laughing at something clean for once.If you're not sure if this is your cup o' tea, there should be an Editor Review somewhere up top that has some text straight from the DVD.

Much more than simple but boring Church humor.Now I wanted to see if this was a wide spread phenomena, or just a one hit wonder in a sea of Christian Comedic flops.My next trial was ""The Clean Stand-Up Comedy Tour."" This one was a complete and total disaster. It was so bad, when I wrote the review, I barely knew where to begin.But I was undaunted in my search for more good Christian Comedy. Surely there must be more out there somewhere.After mustering my courage, I rented ""Thou Shalt Laugh 2."" I would have started with the first one, but it was not available. Thou Shalt Laugh 2 was not very good at all, but at least it was an improvement over my last one.I was about to give up. Perhaps that first good one was indeed just a fluke. But just then, my best friend wrote me that he had a wonderful experience with Thou Shalt Laugh 1. I trust my friend's judgment, so I took a chance. (I have to give my friend a shameless plug here. His name is Eric Wilson and he writes Good Christian Fiction, which is also tough to find. He wrote the book to the movie FireProof.)Im so happy that I did. The original Thou Shalt Laugh is a gem! It was hosted by Patricia Heaton from ""Everybody Loves Raymond"". Now I must have been one of the few that did not like Raymond, but after seeing this, I have new respect for Patricia. She was a joy to watch as the host. She was funny, charming and genuine.I was very intrigued to see Thor Ramsey in this one as well. I had given Thor a very bad review in ""The Clean Comedy Stand up Tour"". In this one, he shined. He was among the best on the video.Jeff Allen, from the Apostles of Comedy, was a pleasure to watch as always. His humor is side splitting and relevant. His routine revolves around married life. My favorite line was ""My father told me one thing about marriage: Do you want to be right, or do you want to be happy?Taylor Mason is an amazing Ventriloquist. He does a bit with a puppet called Romeo that is a must see. My only critique in his performance was that he uses a little pig in one part of his act. I can accept voices coming from a man or woman puppet. But when it came to this very small pig, it was just so far from reality that I couldn't deal with it.A new comic, at least for me, was a guy by the name of Michael Jr. My favorite of his routine was ""Someone asked me, 'Are you pro-gay?' No, I'm not pro-gay. I'm not amateur gay either.""For me, there was only one flop in this video. I had to go back and look through all the names to find him. His name was Joby Saad. Im not sure if this guy really was mentally slow or this was his act. But it really doesnt matter. His act was terrible. But oddly enough, it was also one of the longest. Go figure!Overall, Id have to give this one a 4 to 4 1/2 stars. If you want some good clean comedy, this one is a keeper. What I cant figure out is how the producers of this wonderfully successful video went on to the flop called Thou Shalt Laugh 2. Such is the life of sequels I guess.....I am unsure if I will try to take on Though Shalt Laugh 3. Im sure in the end, I will take the plunge and hold on to my hope that Good Clean Christian Comedy does in fact exist.",4,Does good Chrsitian Comedy really Exists?,1237852800,"03 24, 2009",2009,3480,"['following', 'journals', 'search.My', 'first', 'experience', 'Christian', 'Comedy', 'years', 'was', 'Apostles', 'Comedy', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'complete', 'review', 'click', 'here', 'made', 'think', 'Christian', 'Comedy', 'had', 'finally', 'evolved', 'something', 'Christians', 'could', 'be', 'proud', 'comedy', 'was', 'clean', 'hilarious', 'Much', 'more', 'simple', 'boring', 'Church', 'humor.Now', 'wanted', 'see', 'was', 'wide', 'spread', 'phenomena', 'just', 'one', 'hit', 'wonder', 'sea', 'Christian', 'Comedic', 'flops.My', 'next', 'trial', 'was', 'Clean', 'Stand-Up', 'Comedy', 'Tour', 'one', 'was', 'complete', 'total', 'disaster', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'when', 'wrote', 'review', 'barely', 'knew', 'where', 'begin.But', 'was', 'undaunted', 'search', 'more', 'good', 'Christian', 'Comedy', 'Surely', 'must', 'be', 'more', 'there', 'somewhere.After', 'mustering', 'courage', 'rented', 'Thou', 'Shalt', 'Laugh', '2', 'would', 'have', 'started', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'not', 'available', 'Thou', 'Shalt', 'Laugh', '2', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'least', 'was', 'improvement', 'last', 'one.I', 'was', 'give', 'up', 'Perhaps', 'first', 'good', 'one', 'was', 'indeed', 'just', 'fluke', 'just', 'then', 'best', 'friend', 'wrote', 'had', 'wonderful', 'experience', 'Thou', 'Shalt', 'Laugh', '1', 'trust', 'friend', 'judgment', 'took', 'chance', 'have', 'give', 'friend', 'shameless', 'plug', 'here', 'name', 'Eric', 'Wilson', 'Good', 'Christian', 'Fiction', 'also', 'tough', 'find', 'wrote', 'book', 'movie', 'FireProof', 'Im', 'so', 'happy', 'did', 'original', 'Thou', 'Shalt', 'Laugh', 'gem', 'was', 'hosted', 'Patricia', 'Heaton', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'Now', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'few', 'did', 'not', 'Raymond', 'seeing', 'have', 'new', 'respect', 'Patricia', 'was', 'joy', 'watch', 'host', 'was', 'funny', 'charming', 'genuine.I', 'was', 'very', 'intrigued', 'see', 'Thor', 'Ramsey', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'had', 'given', 'Thor', 'very', 'bad', 'review', 'Clean', 'Comedy', 'Stand', 'up', 'Tour', 'one', 'shined', 'was', 'best', 'video.Jeff', 'Allen', 'Apostles', 'Comedy', 'was', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'always', 'humor', 'side', 'splitting', 'relevant', 'routine', 'revolves', 'married', 'life', 'favorite', 'line', 'was', 'father', 'told', 'one', 'thing', 'marriage', 'Do', 'want', 'be', 'right', 'do', 'want', 'be', 'happy', 'Taylor', 'Mason', 'amazing', 'Ventriloquist', 'bit', 'puppet', 'called', 'Romeo', 'must', 'see', 'only', 'critique', 'performance', 'was', 'little', 'pig', 'one', 'part', 'act', 'can', 'accept', 'voices', 'coming', 'man', 'woman', 'puppet', 'when', 'came', 'very', 'small', 'pig', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'far', 'reality', 'could', ""n't"", 'deal', 'it.A', 'new', 'comic', 'least', 'was', 'guy', 'name', 'Michael', 'Jr.', 'My', 'favorite', 'routine', 'was', 'Someone', 'asked', 'pro-gay', 'No', ""'m"", 'not', 'pro-gay', ""'m"", 'not', 'amateur', 'gay', 'either', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'flop', 'video', 'had', 'go', 'back', 'look', 'names', 'find', 'name', 'was', 'Joby', 'Saad', 'Im', 'not', 'sure', 'guy', 'really', 'was', 'mentally', 'slow', 'was', 'act', 'really', 'doesnt', 'matter', 'act', 'was', 'terrible', 'oddly', 'enough', 'was', 'also', 'one', 'longest', 'Go', 'figure', 'Overall', 'Id', 'have', 'give', 'one', '4', '4', '1/2', 'stars', 'want', 'good', 'clean', 'comedy', 'one', 'keeper', 'What', 'cant', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'producers', 'wonderfully', 'successful', 'video', 'went', 'flop', 'called', 'Thou', 'Shalt', 'Laugh', '2', 'Such', 'life', 'sequels', 'guess', '..I', 'am', 'unsure', 'will', 'try', 'take', 'Though', 'Shalt', 'Laugh', '3', 'Im', 'sure', 'end', 'will', 'take', 'plunge', 'hold', 'hope', 'Good', 'Clean', 'Christian', 'Comedy', 'fact', 'exist']",Thou Shalt Laugh
