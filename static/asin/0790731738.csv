Leslie Neilsen is a high-end, wickedly intelligent ""John"".Spoiler: he attacks her and she kills him.And we're off and running.Richard Dreyfuss is a high-end, wickedly intelligent actor who portray's her lawyer who sets out to prove that Claudia (Streisand) isn't ""nuts"", or crazy, or off of her rocker.  It ain't easy.  Streisand's ""Claudia"" speaks the truth and to hell with rest of you.Maureen Stapleton, Karl Malden, and Eli Wallach are high-end, wickedly intelligent actors.  Everyone knows what they are doing here, but no one seems to know why they are doing it.  It's not a great film, and no one but the supporting cast (Stapleton, Malden and Wallach) delivers the goods.  Streisand wants Dreyfuss to like her and Dreyfuss really can't stand her.  It's palpable and unfortunate.  Read: Richard Dreyfuss really doesn't like Barbra Streisand.  He said, in an interview, that he ""carried her coat"".  What does that tell you?So this film really has nothing but a bunch of high-end, wickedly intelligent actors meeting up and no one has has the tenacity or the talent to meet up and connect with anyone else.  It's a lot of great talent but the talent has nowhere to go.  It's like ""Chopped"" where you are given a bunch of ingredients and are expected to create a masterpiece of a dish.

97574,AE42JLYPXUI45,0790731738,"Chad DeFeo ""(ChandlerBingFan)""","[2, 2]","Barbra Streisand has been one of the most talented female singers in this world, with releasing a slew of successful albums. It wasn't until 1968, when Barbra decided to get her hands on acting career to back up her singing career, when she starred in the film adapted version of the Broadway classic, ""Funny Girl"", where she played the lead role of Fanny Brice. After Funny Girl, Barbra took the lead role of many other films, such as ""The Way We Were"", ""Funny Lady"", ""Yentl"", ""The Main Event"", ""On A Clear Day You Can See Forever"", ""Hello Dolly"", and many others. But in 1987, Barbra landed herself the lead role no one will ever forget. That role, ladies and gentlemen, was Claudia Draper for the film, ""Nuts"".Claudia Draper (played by Barbra Streisand) is an expensive hooker, who is arrested for the murder of one of her clients (played by Leslie Nielson). What the courts and police don't know is that what Claudia has done was not first-degree manslaughter; it was clearly self-defense. Claudia and her date have already had sex with each other, but her date wanted a bit more. After refusing, he became rather aggressive, attacking Claudia. Strangling her, Claudia picks up a piece of glass and kills her date, in self-defense. Her mother, Rose Kirk (played by Maureen Stapleton), and her stepfather, Arthur Kirk (played by Karl Malden), along with two psychiatrists, as well as the police have considered her to be incompetent, especially for attending the trial, forcing her to stay in an institution. Defending Claudia is Aaron Levinsky (played by the brilliant and outstanding Richard Dreyfuss). During the preliminary hearing, Claudia's stepfather has revealed a devastating secret to his wife, as well as, the court. His deepest secret is the perfect explanation to why Claudia has terrible temper, as to also why her childhood was so terrible.I have seen a pretty good share of Barbra's films, but as far as I'm concerned, her role as Claudia Draper is her highest and most brilliant. Whether you enjoy her music more, or her acting more, you cannot deny that this film is her absolute best. If you have not seen this film, then I suggest to you strongly that you see this film and watch Barbra Streisand in her most serious and touching role ever.",5,Nuts (1987),1109376000,"02 26, 2005",2005,2263,"['Barbra', 'Streisand', 'been', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'female', 'singers', 'world', 'releasing', 'slew', 'successful', 'albums', 'was', ""n't"", '1968', 'when', 'Barbra', 'decided', 'get', 'hands', 'acting', 'career', 'back', 'up', 'singing', 'career', 'when', 'starred', 'film', 'adapted', 'version', 'Broadway', 'classic', 'Funny', 'Girl', 'where', 'played', 'lead', 'role', 'Fanny', 'Brice', 'Funny', 'Girl', 'Barbra', 'took', 'lead', 'role', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'such', 'Way', 'Were', 'Funny', 'Lady', 'Yentl', 'Main', 'Event', 'Clear', 'Day', 'Can', 'See', 'Forever', 'Hello', 'Dolly', 'many', 'others', '1987', 'Barbra', 'landed', 'lead', 'role', 'one', 'will', 'ever', 'forget', 'role', 'ladies', 'gentlemen', 'was', 'Claudia', 'Draper', 'film', 'Nuts', '.Claudia', 'Draper', 'played', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'expensive', 'hooker', 'who', 'arrested', 'murder', 'one', 'clients', 'played', 'Leslie', 'Nielson', 'What', 'courts', 'police', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Claudia', 'done', 'was', 'not', 'first-degree', 'manslaughter', 'was', 'clearly', 'self-defense', 'Claudia', 'date', 'have', 'already', 'had', 'sex', 'other', 'date', 'wanted', 'bit', 'more', 'refusing', 'became', 'rather', 'aggressive', 'attacking', 'Claudia', 'Strangling', 'Claudia', 'up', 'piece', 'glass', 'date', 'self-defense', 'mother', 'Rose', 'Kirk', 'played', 'Maureen', 'Stapleton', 'stepfather', 'Arthur', 'Kirk', 'played', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'two', 'psychiatrists', 'as', 'well', 'police', 'have', 'considered', 'be', 'incompetent', 'especially', 'attending', 'trial', 'forcing', 'stay', 'institution', 'Defending', 'Claudia', 'Aaron', 'Levinsky', 'played', 'brilliant', 'outstanding', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'preliminary', 'hearing', 'Claudia', 'stepfather', 'revealed', 'devastating', 'secret', 'wife', 'as', 'well', 'court', 'deepest', 'secret', 'perfect', 'explanation', 'why', 'Claudia', 'terrible', 'temper', 'also', 'why', 'childhood', 'was', 'so', 'terrible.I', 'have', 'seen', 'pretty', 'good', 'share', 'Barbra', 'films', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'role', 'Claudia', 'Draper', 'highest', 'most', 'brilliant', 'enjoy', 'music', 'more', 'acting', 'more', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'film', 'absolute', 'best', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'then', 'suggest', 'strongly', 'see', 'film', 'watch', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'most', 'serious', 'touching', 'role', 'ever']",N/A

97578,A2DS532SLTFWFK,0790731738,Det. Abilene,"[25, 26]","Badly neglected by both audiences and critics at the time of it's original release, NUTS is a film that is ripe for reevaluation. Based on Tom Toplor's 1981 courtroom play, NUTS is definitely a dialogue-based film with little Hollywood flashiness. Though extremely well-written (by Toplor, adapting his own work with Darryl Ponicsan and Alvin Sargent) and sharply staged and directed by veteran Martin Ritt, it is the cast whom is really responsible bringing NUTS to life. Barbra Streisand gives an absolutely bravura performance that should have earned her an Oscar nomination. Alternately hilarious and frightening, Streisand is always mesmerizing as she delves so far into character.Richard Dreyfess is nothing less than Streisand's equal as her public defender. He too was robbed of an Oscar nomination. The supporting cast is a top-notch ensemble of professional character actors (Maureen Stapleton, Eli Wallach, Robert Webber, James Whitmore, and Karl Malden), all of whom work their craft flawlessly. NUTS' screenplay does indulge in the predictability of some of the typical courtroom-plot conventions a little too often, but Toplor's absorbing script still deserves high praise for it's fascinating exploration of what constitutes as normality and whether or not the insane should be required to receive treatment. NUTS isn't going to win over any fans of 3-cuts-per-second action films, but it leave lovers of thought-provoking, expertly-acted dramas fascinated.About the DVD: The picture quality is dark and grainy, however, I believe that this reflects the film's intended look. The sound is fine, and it's nice to have the film's trailer included. Streisand's intelligent and entertaining full-length commentary is the main extra here, and it more than makes up for the disappointing tracks she contributed to the WHAT'S UP, DOC? and MAIN EVENT DVDs.",5,"""I won't be nuts for you""",1118534400,"06 12, 2005",2005,1863,"['Badly', 'neglected', 'audiences', 'critics', 'time', 'original', 'release', 'NUTS', 'film', 'ripe', 'reevaluation', 'Based', 'Tom', 'Toplor', '1981', 'courtroom', 'play', 'NUTS', 'definitely', 'dialogue-based', 'film', 'little', 'Hollywood', 'flashiness', 'extremely', 'well-written', 'Toplor', 'adapting', 'own', 'work', 'Darryl', 'Ponicsan', 'Alvin', 'Sargent', 'sharply', 'staged', 'directed', 'veteran', 'Martin', 'Ritt', 'cast', 'whom', 'really', 'responsible', 'bringing', 'NUTS', 'life', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'absolutely', 'bravura', 'performance', 'should', 'have', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Alternately', 'hilarious', 'frightening', 'Streisand', 'always', 'mesmerizing', 'so', 'far', 'character.Richard', 'Dreyfess', 'nothing', 'less', 'Streisand', 'equal', 'public', 'defender', 'too', 'was', 'robbed', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'supporting', 'cast', 'top-notch', 'ensemble', 'professional', 'character', 'actors', 'Maureen', 'Stapleton', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'Robert', 'Webber', 'James', 'Whitmore', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'whom', 'work', 'craft', 'flawlessly', 'NUTS', 'screenplay', 'indulge', 'predictability', 'typical', 'courtroom-plot', 'conventions', 'little', 'too', 'often', 'Toplor', 'absorbing', 'script', 'still', 'high', 'praise', 'fascinating', 'exploration', 'what', 'normality', 'not', 'insane', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'receive', 'treatment', 'NUTS', ""n't"", 'going', 'win', 'over', 'fans', '3-cuts-per-second', 'action', 'films', 'leave', 'lovers', 'thought-provoking', 'expertly-acted', 'dramas', 'DVD', 'picture', 'quality', 'dark', 'grainy', 'however', 'believe', 'film', 'intended', 'look', 'sound', 'fine', 'nice', 'have', 'film', 'trailer', 'included', 'Streisand', 'intelligent', 'entertaining', 'full-length', 'commentary', 'main', 'extra', 'here', 'more', 'up', 'disappointing', 'tracks', 'contributed', 'WHAT', 'UP', 'DOC', 'MAIN', 'EVENT', 'DVDs']",N/A

It's themes echo those in Streisand's own life: speaking out for what you believe; sexism; challenging the system; and child sexual and emotional abuse.NUTS is a difficult movie in Streisand's career.  She's trying really hard in this film to provide a dramatic performance. And Streisand does a great job!  She has some wonderful moments in NUTS. I think some of the problems, however, lie in the script - or maybe in the U.S. court system! ...The supporting cast is incredible - a who's who of old-school Method acting.  Karl Malden plays against type in his role as Claudia's stepfather - his revelatory scene with Streisand brings chills.  Maureen Stapleton and Eli Wallach turn in fine performances too, although Mr. Wallach is given the thankless task of playing ""therapist bad guy.""My overall impression with NUTS is that it is ""old-fashioned"" in acting style and presentation.  It is gloriously photographed and everyone speaks beautifully.  If it were made by a different director and starred different actors, then NUTS would be a completely different show.  For instance, imagine Debra Winger (orginally aligned with the project) as Claudia.The point with Streisand is that her films and concerts are all performance art - variations on a theme: her life.  Her fans (of which I am one) appreciate this.  It's not so much that Streisand succeeds or fails at playing a prostitute.  It's that, cognizant or not, she chose a role that dealt with the abuse from a step father and the mending of a relationship with a mother - two themes in Streisand's own personal life.

The consequences of the sexual abuse was the exact cause of how Barbra portrayed the character.  This is an excellent example of what happens when this abuse is inflicted on a child.  They are taught by the pedophile how to please and usually become very amorous, as a result of what they are taught.The scope of the damage can and will cause the abused child to ""act out"" and the impact of what the abuser has done to the child can never be erased and/or disappear.  It is the ""best kept secret"" in our society.  The shame and guilt the child hides is something that haunts them the rest of their lives.Barbra, in this film, portrayed the character perfectly and demonstrated the exact damage that occurred and how she re-acted to it, Richard, as her attorney, did a fabulous portrayal of a very savvy father and with no help from Barbra's character, ascertained very quickly what happened to her and cleverly extracted the information out of Karl Malden and the truth came out in a very affective way.Brilliant performances by every actor involved in the film and all seasoned veterans in the film industry. In my opinion, they all deserved Academy Awards for the characters they portrayed.I recommend that this film can and should be used as an educational tool for children who have been abused so they can see that they are not alone in this twisted, toxic sickness that is so firmly implanted in our society.Kudos and accolades to everytone that was involved in the making of this film.",5,"On my ""A"" list !

Claudia Draper (Barbra Streisand) is a high priced call girl who has killed one of her johns (Leslie Nielsen).  Her parents, Arthur and Rose Kirk (Karl Malden and Maureen Stapleton), just want to sweep it under the carpet by having her committed to an institution.  But she doesn't anything to do with her parents or their scheme.Her high priced lawyer quits after she attacks him. That gets the attention of public defender Aaron Levinsky (Richard Dreyfuss).  The arraignment judge (Dakin Matthews) is displeased with Levinsky's wanting to take this to trial and only gives him the weekend to prepare his case for the sanity trial. Their relationship begins is a chess match of trust.Levinsky gathers the evidence he needs for the trial and the sanity trail begins with trial Judge Stanley Murdoch (James Whitmore).  The first prosecution witness is Dr. Morrison (Eli Wallach) who testifies that Claudia should be institutionalized.  This followed by her mother Rose who testifies about her past.  And then her stepfather Arthur testifies.  During the testimony, Claudia first draws her stepfather as a vampire then her parents with no mouths.  Aaron puts the clues together and discovers that Arthur was molesting Claudia.The defense puts up its only witness, Claudia.  Even under sedation, Claudia makes her points.  The prosecution recalls Dr. Morrison and his testimony inflames Claudia and she makes an impassioned rebuttal.Martin Ritt and Barbra Streisand assembled a flawless cast.  The role of Claudia was made for Streisand.  She has a field day with it.  Maureen Stapleton is always a joy to see and she hits all emotional levels with this role.  Karl Malden usually plays the stoic heroic man.  This was an underrated performance and should have been garnered more attention.  James Whitmore had a small pivotal role but showed what featured actor really means.  And this is probably Richard Dreyfuss' best performance.Martin Ritt was one of the great directors and he liked nothing more than a controversial film.  This was a perfect film for him.Streisand did triple duty on this film besides starring, she produce the film and did the musical score.  Streisand has shown that she has a talent for scoring films.  Before, she just wrote music for songs.  This was a big step for her and it proved that she can do more than the normal performer.If you like high drama, courtroom films or just plain good acting, this is your film.DVD EXTRAS: Commentary by Barbra Streisand",5,Streisand proved she's not Nuts.

It is up to herself and her lawyer, played by Richard Dreyfuss, to keep her out of an insane asylym and prison. The supporting acting is headed by Karl Malden and Maureen Stapleton, who play Claudia's (the Streisand character) parents. While the story unfolds during the testimony by certain people, many secrets are revealed in reference to Claudia's past, and we discover why Claudia became a hooker. ""Nuts"" is extremely well-acted and the direction is top-notched by Martin Ritt. More than a coutroom drama, ""Nuts"" explores human emotions in its characters and delves beneath the surface of the film's inhabitants.
