I thought that I would see Langston and he would talk about his life, from whe he was young and old. If I wanted to see homosexuals, I would of brought a dvd known to be of homosexuals. I was highly disappointed. I cut the dvd up. I felt that it was false representation in making us think that Langston was in all of it, when in actuality, it was just the opposite. It seemed as though these males were seeking for something and they did not know what they were looking for, so they turned to sex, never being fulfilled, because only God can fulfil that void. He is a jealous God. I felt sorry for them. You could see the loneliness within. If you are shallow, then you probably don't know what I am saying, but if you consider yourself deep, so to speak, then you will see why I was disappointed.",1,"Yes, I am still looking for Langston after watching this dvd.",1384819200,"11 19, 2013",2013,892,"['dvd', 'was', 'homosexuals', 'dancing', 'having', 'sex', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'thought', 'would', 'see', 'Langston', 'would', 'talk', 'life', 'whe', 'was', 'young', 'old', 'wanted', 'see', 'homosexuals', 'would', 'brought', 'dvd', 'known', 'be', 'homosexuals', 'was', 'highly', 'disappointed', 'cut', 'dvd', 'up', 'felt', 'was', 'false', 'representation', 'making', 'think', 'Langston', 'was', 'when', 'actuality', 'was', 'just', 'opposite', 'seemed', 'males', 'were', 'seeking', 'something', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'were', 'looking', 'turned', 'sex', 'never', 'being', 'fulfilled', 'only', 'God', 'can', 'fulfil', 'void', 'jealous', 'God', 'felt', 'sorry', 'could', 'see', 'loneliness', 'are', 'shallow', 'then', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'am', 'saying', 'consider', 'deep', 'so', 'speak', 'then', 'will', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'disappointed']",Looking for Langston VHS

Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[1, 2]","British director Isaac Julien's ""Looking for Langston"" visually beautiful montage in black and white is labeled ""A Mediation on Langston Hughes and the Harlem Renaissance""-- ""it was a time when the black artist was in vogue""-- but it is much more than that: It is a statement about homoerotic desire. (Notice the effeminate white tuxedoed man complete with a curl on his forehead as opposed to the strikingly handsome masculine black men.)  It is also a statement about two deeply controversial subjects: homophobia in African American culture (homosexulity is a sin against the race"") and racism in the white world. The director uses images from Robert Mapplethorpe's BLACK BOOK that are considered by many to be racist as well as snatches from the only poem that Hughes ever wrote I believe that is overtly homosexual: ""I loved my friend/He went away from me."" While Mapplethorpe may have been a racist, I am not convinced that his book of photographs of black men is proof of that. For example, there are far more photographs of portraits of African American men than there are of naked men with an emphasis on their genitalia.The photography in this film is stunning. In addition to that of Mapplethorpe, there are stills from Carl Van Vechten, Van Der Zee and Roy DeCarava and moving images, at least one of which appears to be a re-creation of a photograph by George Platt Lynes. Toni Morrison reads from James Baldwin and footage is included of Langston Hughes reading. There is also poetry by Bruce Nugent (The incredibly beautiful and moving line ""He was searching for black poppies from ""Smoke, Lilies and Jade"") and Essex Hemphill who prophetically warns us that we may die from sex from a ""pin-sized hole in a condom.""I saw this film years ago at a gay film festival and have viewed it many times since.

Instead the filmmaker seems more interested in parading around a cadre of gay men on screen for no apparent reason.  The film doesn't even explore with any depth the alleged sexual proclivities of Mr. Hughes.  However, hat's off to the cinematographer and the production designer -- the film looks great.  They should get plenty of work by placing the film on their respective demo reels.  Unfortunately, as a fully realized work, the material is woefully lacking.  At least the gay-themed &quot;Tongues Untied&quot; by the late Marlon Riggs, was at times insightful and funny.

The film is made so beautifully- it worships the contibution the poet Langston Hughes made on this earth- and also lends itself to celebrating the strength that other gay men- and, hell, anyone on the outer- should feel and be thankful for. Triumph of belief and passion over misguided energy and vanity. This film worships risk-takers, underdogs and worships the gentle strength in the human male (so rarely explored) and seems to celebrate our connection to nature in a very vivid  and timless way. As a confused aggressive gay man at 18 year old- i saw this film and felt like there was someone else on this earth who spoke my langauge and said- hey you! you're not alone- do what you want to do so passionately and be proud of what it is that you have to say, you have a right to be here. So feel free and be yourself- the world needs to hear what it is you feel. God bless the man that made this film- it tickles my soul.
