477141,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6305770395,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[21, 22]","I am a true believe that the best films that Hollywood ever produced came from the 1940s.  Whether it was in the early 40s like the film Gaslight or later like Lean's Great Expectations, I have never seen so many great stories with so much originality, humanity, and creativity.  Impact is no different.  What transformed this picture from your typical film-noir thriller into a full-fledged murder/mystery is not just the creative story, but also the strong characters, the twisting themes, and the questionable ending.  Impact could not have been as fascinating as it was if it were not for the impressive story.  From the opening scene, we think that we have this film already pegged as your typical ""wife cheats on man and he now wants revenge"" story, but as director Arthur Lubin guides us further down his diabolical path, we learn that there is going to be more surprises than we originally anticipated.  These surprises will not only lock your jaw in a shocked position, but it will also provide 111 minutes of pure uncut film-noir.I have read other reviews that claim that Impact does not fall within the typical film-noir genre.  I see where they are saying this, but I do not agree.  Lubin, I believe, was creating a classy film-noir for his audience, but he tricked us.  He not only tricked us from the beginning of the film to the end, but also where the film-noir style should be placed.  We assume that the because Brian Donlevy is our centralized character that he has to be the dark and brooding one the entire time, causing the sensation of film-noir.  I saw this film in a different light.  As Lubin kept Donlevy in the eye of the camera for most of the film, I thought that the true sinister, dark, brooding, spooky, and edgy character was Irene.  Helen Walker did a superb job with this role.  Not only did she portray the backstabbing wife with such precision and ease, but she also played this very strong character that I was not expecting.  That sensation of film-noir with the themes of suspicion, anxiety, and pessimism are all collected well within Walker's portrayal of Irene.  It is this character that fully embodies the idea of film-noir, and I couldn't keep my eyes off her the entire film.  To see such a powerful female character in such an early age of Hollywood impressed me.  I do not see why Impact has not made a bigger impression in the film communities.  It is a landmark film that will keep you guessing in a better way than any Shyamalan film will.Even if you cannot agree with me about Lubin's slight of ""film-noir"" hands, it is unmistakably true that Impact contains some of the best story coupled with acting that we have seen in quite a long time.  Even in today's Hollywood you just do not see this type of intensity, excitement, and curiosity as you found in Impact.  I would not be surprised if we eventually saw a remake of this film in the future. It has all the elements that one would desire to be a box-office sensation; an evil wife, a passionate husband, and a dark secret.  Who wouldn't love to see this?  I personally could not keep my eyes off the story or the actors in this film.  Brian Donlevy was beyond normal as the disarmed man facing the truth that his wife is no longer in love with him.  This being my first Donlevy film, I cannot wait to see other pieces of his work.  I think he was both strong and weak enough to carry the picture.  He had to show that he still loved his wife, no matter what she did, and he pulled it off with so much dedication that I nearly wanted to stand up and clap for him in my living room.  I have already spoken on Irene, who I believe matched Donlevy straw for straw.  Lubin needed a character that was going to counter Donlevy's like-ability, and Helen Walker did just that.  As audience members, we wanted to love her and hate her at the same time.  Ella Raines was nothing spectacular, but did bring this light pro-feminism theme into this light film-noir thriller.  Tony Barrett was the epitome of evil; never breaking character and always making me feel slimy.  My personal favorite character was Lt. Tom Quincy.  I have seen many parodies when they would use the southern flatfoot, but I had never seen a film that utilized this clich&eacute; character.  Impact did it and Charles Coburn perfected it.  As he attempted to solve the crime, he used the vice of kindness and dedication, making this critic smile with delight.  He carried the truth of this film on his back without any struggle at all.Overall, I thought that Impact was yet another great film that I can attribute to the 1940s.  I don't know who the brains were during this cinematic time, but I wish I could go back and shake their hands.  Their imagination, ability to keep audiences guessing, as well as produce great ""B"" level actors giving more than 100% of their abilities to a film is nearly impossible to find today.  I would have loved to live during this era and see these films in the smoky auditoriums packed with untouched minds.  Impact was nearly flawless.  I guess it dragged sometimes, and the ending seemed to be wrapped up a bit too quickly (again, the happy factor wasn't needed at the end), but this film kept my attention throughout.  I cannot wait to show this movie to friends and family.  To fully see where we get our ideas for our films in the year 2006, we must make sure that we respect the films from the 1940s.  Impact should be at the top of every film enthusiast's list!Grade: ***** out of *****",5,"In this world, you turn the other cheek, and you get hit with a lug wrench.",1141516800,"03 5,

Donlevy is the star of the flick and he does more to draw you into the flick than dialogue ever could. He may not be tall but he has an imposing facing! His eyes and strong facial structure is a sight to see! I have to say that the film could have been shorter but in doing this some amazing cinematography would have been lost the image of a prisoned Willams (Donlevey) looking through a gate at his future love is amazing and the scene where his lover chases a woman who is crucial in freeing Williams of a crime through the narrow streets and shadows of chinatown is perfection.

477143,AGEIT17HENDIS,6305770395,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","I am on record, maybe not a swear on the bible take it to court under oath type record but on record, as being very much enthralled by (from a  safe cinematic distance ) the bad femme fatales of film noir. I have spent no little ink mooning over Jane Greer in Out Of The Past as she off-handedly shots a bullet or six in any stray guy like Robert Mitchum who thinks maybe he can help her or glamorous Rita Hayworth as she frames, frames big time, one Orson Welles just because his was a little smitten with her after smelling that come hither fragrance. Yah, these guys had it coming because they went with their eyes open, took their chances and took the fall, took the fall big time. But what about a guy, a regular nine to five guy, a soft guy with eyes closed who gets waylaid by his femme wife. Well, said femme may just enter into the pantheon with Ms. Greer and Ms. Hayworth as Helen Walker does in this film noir Impact. While the story line is not nearly as riveting as the two films mentioned above low down Irene (Ms. Walker) saves the day.Here is the beauty of this little noir. Walter (played by Brian Donlevy) a regular love-infected hard working executive ready to move might and main to keep his bosses happy and the nation productive is totally clueless that his wife, Irene, is two-timing him with some callow young guy, Jim. Moreover she has hatched a plan to cut Walter lose. Her lover-boy, if he is up to it is going to take down poor Walter and they will then go off into the sunset and spend Walter's hard earned dough until she gets  tired of him. Yah dames like Irene tire easily so watch your back if you happen to run across such a femme. As it turns out Jim is not up to the job or at least at up to having enough sense to keep his wits about him when he is doing murder. He leaves Walter for dead but in his rush has a rather nasty head on collision with a gas truck. So long Jim it probably wouldn't have worked out with Irene any way.But this is where our Irene really takes off. Naturally under the circumstances Walter, who was left for dead in some rotten ravine by the late unlamented Jim, starts to put two and two together to figure out that faithless  Irene maybe doesn't love him and if he heads back to hometown `Frisco he is liable to take another tumble from some new Jim before long. So he blows town, blows his whole upward mobile history and winds up in Podunk Idaho as a grease monkey where the air is pure, people are straight and off-hand war widow, Marsha (played by Ella Raines)  is pining away to put some life back into our poor Walter Mitty.Meanwhile back in `Frisco Irene is in some trouble, some jail trouble, since one very pesky police detective, played by Charles Coburn, has put two and two together and found that it comes out murder, the murder of her ""undead husband. Here is where we get back to the beautiful part again though. Ms. Goody out in Podunk, after finding out who Walter really is, naturally makes him go back to face the music. And just as naturally old wifey Irene when he shows up undead  starts to frame old regular guy Walter for her late boyfriend' untimely demise.And that is all that needs to be said. Sure Walter is going to beat the rap but isn't it something that femme Irene, without batting an eye, is ready to send hubby to the chair to revenge her late lover. One of the great femme noir twists. Yes, Helen step right up with Jane and Rita they are waiting with open arms. This is one bad femme but I sure hope she beats that attempted murder rap they are going to hang on her.",4,Watch Your Back Brother This Dame Is Murder,1347667200,"09 15, 2012",2012,3567,"['am', 'record', 'maybe', 'not', 'swear', 'bible', 'take', 'court', 'oath', 'type', 'record', 'record', 'being', 'very', 'much', 'enthralled', 'safe', 'cinematic', 'distance', 'bad', 'femme', 'fatales', 'film', 'noir', 'have', 'spent', 'little', 'ink', 'mooning', 'Jane', 'Greer', 'Out', 'Past', 'off-handedly', 'shots', 'bullet', 'six', 'stray', 'guy', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'who', 'maybe', 'can', 'help', 'glamorous', 'Rita', 'Hayworth', 'frames', 'big', 'time', 'one', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'just', 'was', 'little', 'smitten', 'smelling', 'come', 'hither', 'fragrance', 'Yah', 'guys', 'had', 'coming', 'went', 'eyes', 'open', 'took', 'chances', 'took', 'fall', 'took', 'fall', 'big', 'time', 'what', 'guy', 'regular', 'nine', 'five', 'guy', 'soft', 'guy', 'eyes', 'closed', 'who', 'waylaid', 'femme', 'wife', 'Well', 'said', 'femme', 'may', 'just', 'enter', 'pantheon', 'Ms.', 'Greer', 'Ms.', 'Hayworth', 'Helen', 'Walker', 'film', 'noir', 'Impact', 'story', 'line', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'riveting', 'two', 'films', 'mentioned', 'low', 'down', 'Irene', 'Ms.', 'Walker', 'day.Here', 'beauty', 'little', 'noir', 'Walter', 'played', 'Brian', 'Donlevy', 'regular', 'love-infected', 'hard', 'working', 'executive', 'ready', 'move', 'might', 'main', 'keep', 'bosses', 'happy', 'nation', 'productive', 'totally', 'clueless', 'wife', 'Irene', 'two-timing', 'callow', 'young', 'guy', 'Jim', 'Moreover', 'hatched', 'plan', 'cut', 'Walter', 'lose', 'lover-boy', 'going', 'take', 'down', 'poor', 'Walter', 'will', 'then', 'go', 'off', 'sunset', 'spend', 'Walter', 'hard', 'earned', 'tired', 'dames', 'Irene', 'tire', 'easily', 'so', 'watch', 'back', 'happen', 'run', 'femme', 'out', 'Jim', 'not', 'up', 'job', 'least', 'up', 'having', 'enough', 'sense', 'keep', 'wits', 'when', 'doing', 'murder', 'Walter', 'dead', 'rush', 'rather', 'nasty', 'head', 'collision', 'gas', 'truck', 'So', 'long', 'Jim', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'worked', 'out', 'Irene', 'way.But', 'where', 'Irene', 'really', 'off', 'Naturally', 'circumstances', 'Walter', 'who', 'was', 'left', 'dead', 'rotten', 'ravine', 'late', 'unlamented', 'Jim', 'put', 'two', 'two', 'together', 'figure', 'out', 'faithless', 'Irene', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'love', 'back', 'hometown', 'Frisco', 'liable', 'take', 'tumble', 'new', 'Jim', 'long', 'town', 'whole', 'upward', 'mobile', 'history', 'up', 'Podunk', 'Idaho', 'grease', 'monkey', 'where', 'air', 'pure', 'people', 'are', 'straight', 'off-hand', 'war', 'widow', 'Marsha', 'played', 'Ella', 'Raines', 'pining', 'away', 'put', 'life', 'back', 'poor', 'Walter', 'Mitty.Meanwhile', 'back', 'Frisco', 'Irene', 'trouble', 'jail', 'trouble', 'one', 'very', 'pesky', 'police', 'detective', 'played', 'Charles', 'Coburn', 'put', 'two', 'two', 'together', 'found', 'out', 'murder', 'murder', 'undead', 'husband', 'Here', 'where', 'get', 'back', 'beautiful', 'part', 'again', 'Ms.', 'Goody', 'out', 'Podunk', 'finding', 'out', 'who', 'Walter', 'really', 'naturally', 'go', 'back', 'face', 'music', 'just', 'naturally', 'old', 'wifey', 'Irene', 'when', 'up', 'undead', 'starts', 'frame', 'old', 'regular', 'guy', 'Walter', 'late', 'boyfriend', 'untimely', 'demise.And', 'be', 'said', 'Sure', 'Walter', 'going', 'beat', 'rap', ""n't"", 'something', 'femme', 'Irene', 'batting', 'eye', 'ready', 'send', 'hubby', 'chair', 'revenge', 'late', 'lover', 'One', 'great', 'femme', 'noir', 'twists', 'Yes', 'Helen', 'step', 'right', 'up', 'Jane', 'Rita', 'are', 'waiting', 'open', 'arms', 'one', 'bad', 'femme', 'sure', 'hope', 'attempted', 'murder', 'rap', 'are', 'going', 'hang']",N/A

477145,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6305770395,C. O. DeRiemer,"[5, 5]","Wealthy San Francisco industrialist Walter Williams (Brian Donlevy) has a big problem he's not aware of. The wife he loves, Irene Williams (Helen Walker), is a manipulating, two-timing slut who has a sleazy boy friend, and the two of them realize Williams is far more valuable to them dead than alive. She'll inherit his money and she can enjoy openly her boy friend. Their plan misfires, however. Williams survives the plot, at first with amnesia, and the boy friend dies in the fiery car crash, burnt beyond recognition and with everyone thinking the corpse was Williams.This is a nicely done semi-noir, not quite an A movie, more like a B-plus. Donlevy plays Williams with his usual stolid directness and is very effective as a man who realizes his wife played him for a fool. When, gradually recovering his memory, he finds himself drifting into the small town of Larkspur, Idaho, he's torn between wanting vengeance on his wife and the prospects for a new life among honest people, doing the work of a car mechanic that he does well, and finding love in the person of Marsha Peters (Ella Raines). When Williams learns that his wife has been accused of planning his murder, he is inclined to let it happen. Marsha convinces him to return to San Francisco and set the record strait. When the tables are turned and Williams is accused of murdering his wife's boy friend, it becomes a race for Marsha to find the evidence that will clear Williams and implicate the wife.Charles Coburn plays Lt. Tom Quincey, an elderly cop due to retire in a year who senses something fishy about the wife's story and decides to look into things more closely. Coburn is the engine who keeps the story on track; without him the story line could become convoluted. As it is, he keeps the plot chugging along. Helen Walker plays the wife and she's very good. She turns Irene Walker into a classy woman who is erotic and ruthless. In a small put important role is Anna May Wong as a servant in the Williams' San Francisco household who ultimately holds the key to Williams' exoneration and Irene's guilt.All in all, this is good, well done film. Part of it is classic noir, but part of it also is sunny, small town America.

As fate would have it the boyfriend while making a hasy escape, lost control of the car plowing it into a gas truck on a narrow mountain pass.  His body, burned beyond recognition, was assumed to be Donlevy.Donlevy meanwhile suffered a severe concussion and staggering through the countryside winds up in the peaceful little town of Larkspur, Idaho.  Meanwhile Helen Walker his wife is brought up on conspiracy to commit murder charges as some evidence implicates her.  Donlevy, in the meantime, takes a job as an auto mechanic in a service station run by young widow Marsha Peters played by Ella Raines.  He takes up residence with her and her mother and for three months is contentedly living in Larkspur.  Donlevy and Raines fall in love and she convinces him to reveal that he survived.Donlevy returns to his home in San Francisco and immediately is arrested for murder of the boyfriend.  He looks like he'll be convicted but some persistent police work by a Lt.

Wong plays the Williams' maid.  After the murder attempt fails and the wife's lover is killed in a flaming car wreck, the police (and everyone else) think that Mr. Williams is the one who died. (It was his car.) A heart-broken Williams, having learned of his wife's betrayal, decides to lay low in a small Idaho town as his wife is prosecuted for his murder. There he falls in love with a war widow (played by Ella Raines) who convinces him to go home and clear things up.Implausibly, however, after Mr. Williams goes to the San Francisco police, his wife is set free and he instead ends up on the stand, accused of murdering his wife's boyfriend. Although Williams' predicament seems unreal, the film still remains interesting.Anna May Wong, who starred in silent films, is in her mid-40s here, but she looks great for her age.

Half-dazed, Williams stumbles into a moving van that takes him to idyllic Larkspur, Idaho, where newspaper stories of his ""death"" jog his memory.

""Impact"" certainly qualifies, a sometimes quirky, sometimes remarkably effective little thriller that's one part Frank Capra and one part Howard Hawks.

Unfortunately, his trophy wife (icy Helen Walker) unrepentantly schemes to have him killed by her oily lover (talented writer/actor Tony Barrett), only as the best laid plans often do . . . By the time he meets spunky good girl Marsha Peters (striking Ella Raines), he's bottomed out -- perhaps the best thing that ever could happen to decent guy like him. ""Impact"" explores the darkness of the human soul but unlike contemporary films, never falls victim to losing faith in the human condition. Without being preachy, it reminds us that monsters often come in pleasing forms and that trust should be neither easily earned nor quickly dismissed. While it suffers from a meager budget, director Arthur Lubin does a competent job, often filming on what looks like sets and locations left over from Hitchcock's ""Vertigo."" Watch the models in a mountainside car crash scene to see the attention to detail (hint: look at the driver's side of the car). Anna May Wong and Philip Ahn have to suffer through ricky-ticky caricatures of Chinese Americans common in the day, but the latter does get a great line that ironically challenges the stereotype.

Otherwise it's an engaging crime drama with so many juicy plot twists and surprises that it's impossible to talk about the plot without including spoilers.The straightforward direction is by Arthur Lubin, who would release the first of five Francis the Talking Mule movies the year IMPACT was released.  Mr. Lubin also developed the Mr. Ed television series, as well as directing Maverick and Bonanza.  This is a piece with those other works; not a lot of style but uniformly entertaining.Brian Donlevy is excellent as the wronged husband.  In a scene that was probably more shocking in 1949 than it is today, Donlevy sobs uncontrollably.  Oddly enough the two women in the movie - Good Girl Ella Raines and Bad Girl/Scheming Wife Helen Walker let drop nary a sincere tear.  Walker's character does indeed put on a show of tears for the suspicious detective, played with a slight Irish brogue by the always reliable Charles Coburn.If you're expecting cartons of cigarettes and a city full of shadowed streets you're going to be disappointed.

During the moment of truth, the tables are turned and the lover is killed in a fiery wreck.The body of the lover is mistaken for Walter Williams who meanwhile is suffering from temporary amnesia.Eventually, the wife goes on trial for the Walter Williams murder and the real Walter Williams, recovered from his amnesia, shows up only to be accused by his wife of her lover's murder.I think we'll leave the story at that pretty good twist and let you readers figure it out from there.IMPACT qualifies as a noir in my opinion as much because of the serpentine story line as well as the back stabbing wife and eager to kill illicit lovers.

I won't go over the plot suffice to say Brian Donlevy's character disappears and starts a new life as a car mechanic for reasons which will become obvious when you watch the movie.

477163,AV37WGFZH7PIO,6305770395,"Vincent Tesi ""Vinny""","[1, 1]","Not your typical noir thriller, Impact has just enough intrigue and an interesting cast of characters to keep classic film viewers appeased.  When Ella Raines dressed in mechanics clothes pops her head from under the hood of a car, I thought the clock on my wall stopped.  She is absolutely gorgeous in this film.  Her performance in this film probably went largely unnoticed, but I could see shades of Kathreen Hepburn in Raines's mannerisms, clever vocal delivery, and classy style. Her role as the good natured well doer resembles an earlier performance as Carol ""Kansas"" Richmond in The Phantom Lady. Actor Brian Donlevy almost 20 years her senior is slightly miscast as her love interest.  But at the same time, Donlevy's role as a high powered executive with a pushover heart for his scheming wife played by Helen Walker is right on the money.  Impact moves uncharacteristically away from the shadows of the metropolis where Helen Walker plots the murder of her husband to the bright, openess of small town America in Lakespur Idaho.  This geographic paradox paralells the conundrum that the protagonist Walter Williams ( Donlevy) is faced with.  Revenge/forgiveness, unrequited love/innocent love, embarrassment/pride, the victim/the accused all surface for our protagonist Williams in this story.  Helen Walker gives a slick performance as Irene, Williams's wife.  The scene when Irene suddenly sees her husband alive is brillantly acted. You can feel the ice between the two characters that in Walter's heart were deeply in love.  Again for me, shades of Susan Heyward surface in Walker's performance as the crafty, dangerous, Irene. Charles Coburn rounds out the fine cast as the resilient inspector who cracks the case.  Minor flaws in the film include the bungled murder plot. Did the boyfriend really think that one hit to the head with a crowbar would mean certain death? The ensuing crash was not convincing.  It seems that scale models were used to simulate the burning car and gasoline truck.  Still the film is a must see for noir fans.",4,Lakespur Idaho or San Francisco Ca. ?,1183161600,"06 30, 2007",2007,2054,"['Not', 'typical', 'noir', 'thriller', 'Impact', 'just', 'enough', 'intrigue', 'interesting', 'cast', 'characters', 'keep', 'classic', 'film', 'viewers', 'appeased', 'When', 'Ella', 'Raines', 'dressed', 'mechanics', 'clothes', 'pops', 'head', 'hood', 'car', 'thought', 'clock', 'wall', 'stopped', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'performance', 'film', 'probably', 'went', 'largely', 'unnoticed', 'could', 'see', 'shades', 'Kathreen', 'Hepburn', 'Raines', 'mannerisms', 'clever', 'vocal', 'delivery', 'classy', 'style', 'role', 'good', 'natured', 'well', 'doer', 'resembles', 'earlier', 'performance', 'Carol', 'Kansas', 'Richmond', 'Phantom', 'Lady', 'Actor', 'Brian', 'Donlevy', 'almost', '20', 'years', 'senior', 'slightly', 'miscast', 'love', 'interest', 'same', 'time', 'Donlevy', 'role', 'high', 'powered', 'executive', 'pushover', 'heart', 'scheming', 'wife', 'played', 'Helen', 'Walker', 'right', 'money', 'Impact', 'uncharacteristically', 'away', 'shadows', 'metropolis', 'where', 'Helen', 'Walker', 'murder', 'husband', 'bright', 'openess', 'small', 'town', 'America', 'Lakespur', 'Idaho', 'geographic', 'paradox', 'conundrum', 'protagonist', 'Walter', 'Williams', 'Donlevy', 'faced', 'Revenge/forgiveness', 'unrequited', 'love/innocent', 'love', 'embarrassment/pride', 'victim/the', 'accused', 'surface', 'protagonist', 'Williams', 'story', 'Helen', 'Walker', 'slick', 'performance', 'Irene', 'Williams', 'wife', 'scene', 'when', 'Irene', 'suddenly', 'husband', 'alive', 'brillantly', 'acted', 'can', 'feel', 'ice', 'two', 'characters', 'Walter', 'heart', 'were', 'deeply', 'love', 'Again', 'shades', 'Susan', 'Heyward', 'surface', 'Walker', 'performance', 'crafty', 'dangerous', 'Irene', 'Charles', 'Coburn', 'out', 'fine', 'cast', 'resilient', 'inspector', 'who', 'case', 'Minor', 'flaws', 'film', 'include', 'bungled', 'murder', 'plot', 'Did', 'boyfriend', 'really', 'think', 'one', 'hit', 'head', 'crowbar', 'would', 'mean', 'certain', 'death', 'ensuing', 'crash', 'was', 'not', 'convincing', 'scale', 'models', 'were', 'used', 'simulate', 'burning', 'car', 'gasoline', 'truck', 'Still', 'film', 'must', 'see', 'noir', 'fans']",N/A
477164,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,6305770395,William Hare,"[9, 10]","""Impact"" is a sturdy 1949 release that delivers much in the way of suspense mystery, keeping viewers guessing, while also revealing much about small town American values in the early post-World War Two period.  This was a time when people were accustomed to helping one another resulting, in part, from the Depression period.The film begins with Brian Donlevy showing his firm side as head of a major construction company based in San Francisco.  When the board of directors refuses to approve new plant construction he nonchalantly tells them that he will go elsewhere and put the same plan into effect.  A 9-0 vote against then turns quickly into a unanimous margin in Donlevy's favor, showing how invaluable the board recognizes him to be.Donlevy's Achilles heel is quickly recognized when he returns to the posh Nob Hill apartment he shares with beautiful, elegantly attired wife Helen Walker.  Her pet name for Donlevy of ""Softy"" has him readily assenting.  He tells her that she is the one person that causes the tough business executive to melt.Walker causes Donlevy to gush while she in turn double deals.  Using a bad toothache as a pretext for not traveling with Donlevy to Lake Tahoe, after which he will proceed on to Denver on business, she pulls off a scheme with paramour Tony Barrett.  He is allegedly her ""cousin"" from Chicago.After Walker tells Donlevy ""regrettably"" that she cannot make the trip with her toothache bothering her, she asks him if he will give her cousin a ride as far as Denver, where the executive has business activity scheduled.Donlevy falls into her web and agrees.  The plot is predictable enough, to get Donlevy out of the way so that the widow, after a period of appropriate ""grieving,"" can find love with her new friend, augmented by a hefty inheritance courtesy of Donlevy.To reveal anymore would jeopardize intricate plotting replete with numerous story twists.  The film is divisible into two parts, Donlevy's activities prior to the moment with fate that will ultimately change his life, and when he arrives in the friendly town of 4,502 called Larkspur, Idaho, where he meets Ella Raines.""Impact"" adopts the familiar and time-proven ""good girl-bad girl"" duality with Walker naturally the latter and beautiful Ella Raines, a wholesome girl next door type, steering Donlevy from a state of bitterness combined with depression after he realizes that the woman who had meant more to him than anyone else has ruthlessly betrayed him and attempted to kill him.Raines runs a gas station and seeks to double as a mechanic.  She is much better at pumping gas and hires Donlevy to serve as mechanic.  He then receives a different impression of life apart from the likes of Walker and Barrett.  Not only is Raines sincere and solid; so is her mother, played by Mae Marsh.Donlevy and Marsh hit it off instantly, so much so that she asks him if he would like to come and live with them.  ""You've got yourself a boarder,"" he tells her.The simple decency of Larkspur is contrasted with the tougher world of San Francisco corporate boardrooms.  Not only does Donlevy fix plenty of cars gratis; he also jumps into the community spirit by joining Larkspur's volunteer fire department.Donlevy realizes that eventually he must return to San Francisco and face up to the responsibility of events spiraling around the machinations of Helen Walker.  Raines insists on helping him, even after he ultimately is compelled to stand trial for ""murder"" for an alleged crime he never committed.Raines' unswerving loyalty and assistance during such an hour of need, saving the man she loves from potential death by execution, is reminiscent of her role in ""Phantom Lady"" when she assists Allen Curtis.Charles Coburn, a crafty San Francisco Police lieutenant nearing retirement, becomes convinced that Donlevy is a victim.  He works closely with Raines to follow all leads, at one point drawing the disgust of his boss, played by veteran Broadway actor Robert Warwick, known for giving Humphrey Bogart a major early theater career break.When time begins running out for Donlevy, Raines is able to garner valuable assistance from the defendant's former maid, played by notable character performer Anna May Wong.  Her assistance prompts the team of Coburn and Raines to achieve a meaningful breakthrough on Donlevy's behalf at a critical moment.Director Arthur Lubin maintains skillful pacing.  He had earlier directed the Universal hit ""Phantom of the Opera"" with Susanna Foster, Nelson Eddy and Claude Rains.  Later he would direct Universal's popular Francis the Talking Mule series.Harry Popkin produced ""Impact.""  In that same year of 1949 another Popkin-produced film debuted, the film noir classic ""D.O.A."" starring Edmond O'Brien.",5,"Solid Mystery, an Ode to Small Town American Values",1170979200,"02 9, 2007",2007,4752,"['Impact', 'sturdy', '1949', 'release', 'much', 'way', 'suspense', 'mystery', 'keeping', 'viewers', 'guessing', 'also', 'revealing', 'much', 'small', 'town', 'American', 'values', 'early', 'post-World', 'War', 'Two', 'period', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'people', 'were', 'accustomed', 'helping', 'one', 'resulting', 'part', 'Depression', 'period.The', 'film', 'Brian', 'Donlevy', 'showing', 'firm', 'side', 'head', 'major', 'construction', 'company', 'based', 'San', 'Francisco', 'When', 'board', 'directors', 'refuses', 'approve', 'new', 'plant', 'construction', 'nonchalantly', 'will', 'go', 'elsewhere', 'put', 'same', 'plan', 'effect', '9-0', 'vote', 'then', 'quickly', 'unanimous', 'margin', 'Donlevy', 'favor', 'showing', 'how', 'invaluable', 'board', 'be.Donlevy', 'Achilles', 'heel', 'quickly', 'recognized', 'when', 'posh', 'Nob', 'Hill', 'apartment', 'shares', 'beautiful', 'elegantly', 'attired', 'wife', 'Helen', 'Walker', 'pet', 'name', 'Donlevy', 'Softy', 'readily', 'assenting', 'one', 'person', 'tough', 'business', 'executive', 'melt.Walker', 'causes', 'Donlevy', 'gush', 'turn', 'double', 'deals', 'Using', 'bad', 'toothache', 'pretext', 'not', 'traveling', 'Donlevy', 'Lake', 'Tahoe', 'will', 'proceed', 'Denver', 'business', 'scheme', 'paramour', 'Tony', 'Barrett', 'allegedly', 'cousin', 'Chicago.After', 'Walker', 'Donlevy', 'regrettably', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'trip', 'toothache', 'bothering', 'will', 'give', 'cousin', 'ride', 'as', 'far', 'Denver', 'where', 'executive', 'business', 'activity', 'scheduled.Donlevy', 'web', 'plot', 'predictable', 'enough', 'get', 'Donlevy', 'way', 'widow', 'period', 'appropriate', 'grieving', 'can', 'find', 'love', 'new', 'friend', 'augmented', 'hefty', 'inheritance', 'courtesy', 'Donlevy.To', 'reveal', 'anymore', 'would', 'jeopardize', 'intricate', 'plotting', 'replete', 'numerous', 'story', 'twists', 'film', 'divisible', 'two', 'parts', 'Donlevy', 'activities', 'prior', 'moment', 'fate', 'will', 'ultimately', 'change', 'life', 'when', 'friendly', 'town', '4,502', 'called', 'Larkspur', 'Idaho', 'where', 'Ella', 'Raines', 'Impact', 'familiar', 'time-proven', 'good', 'girl-bad', 'girl', 'duality', 'Walker', 'naturally', 'latter', 'beautiful', 'Ella', 'Raines', 'wholesome', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'type', 'steering', 'Donlevy', 'state', 'bitterness', 'combined', 'depression', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'meant', 'more', 'anyone', 'else', 'ruthlessly', 'betrayed', 'attempted', 'kill', 'him.Raines', 'gas', 'station', 'double', 'mechanic', 'much', 'better', 'pumping', 'gas', 'Donlevy', 'serve', 'mechanic', 'then', 'different', 'impression', 'life', 'apart', 'likes', 'Walker', 'Barrett', 'Not', 'only', 'Raines', 'sincere', 'solid', 'mother', 'played', 'Mae', 'Marsh.Donlevy', 'Marsh', 'hit', 'off', 'instantly', 'so', 'much', 'would', 'like', 'come', 'live', ""'ve"", 'got', 'boarder', 'her.The', 'simple', 'decency', 'Larkspur', 'contrasted', 'tougher', 'world', 'San', 'Francisco', 'corporate', 'boardrooms', 'Not', 'only', 'Donlevy', 'fix', 'plenty', 'cars', 'gratis', 'also', 'community', 'spirit', 'joining', 'Larkspur', 'volunteer', 'fire', 'department.Donlevy', 'eventually', 'must', 'return', 'San', 'Francisco', 'face', 'up', 'responsibility', 'events', 'spiraling', 'machinations', 'Helen', 'Walker', 'Raines', 'helping', 'even', 'ultimately', 'compelled', 'stand', 'trial', 'murder', 'alleged', 'crime', 'never', 'unswerving', 'loyalty', 'assistance', 'such', 'hour', 'need', 'saving', 'man', 'potential', 'death', 'execution', 'reminiscent', 'role', 'Phantom', 'Lady', 'when', 'Allen', 'Curtis.Charles', 'Coburn', 'crafty', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Police', 'lieutenant', 'nearing', 'retirement', 'convinced', 'Donlevy', 'victim', 'closely', 'Raines', 'follow', 'leads', 'one', 'point', 'drawing', 'disgust', 'boss', 'played', 'veteran', 'Broadway', 'actor', 'Robert', 'Warwick', 'known', 'giving', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'major', 'early', 'theater', 'career', 'break.When', 'time', 'running', 'out', 'Donlevy', 'Raines', 'able', 'garner', 'valuable', 'assistance', 'defendant', 'former', 'maid', 'played', 'notable', 'character', 'performer', 'Anna', 'May', 'Wong', 'assistance', 'team', 'Coburn', 'Raines', 'achieve', 'meaningful', 'breakthrough', 'Donlevy', 'behalf', 'critical', 'moment.Director', 'Arthur', 'Lubin', 'skillful', 'pacing', 'had', 'earlier', 'directed', 'Universal', 'hit', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'Susanna', 'Foster', 'Nelson', 'Eddy', 'Claude', 'Rains', 'Later', 'would', 'direct', 'Universal', 'popular', 'Francis', 'Talking', 'Mule', 'series.Harry', 'Popkin', 'produced', 'Impact', 'same', 'year', '1949', 'Popkin-produced', 'film', 'debuted', 'film', 'noir', 'classic', 'D.O.A', 'starring', 'Edmond', ""O'Brien""]",N/A
