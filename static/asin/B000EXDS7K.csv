980130,A34VV92TSLC37R,B000EXDS7K,Adam Craig,"[6, 6]","It really is a shame that Fox decided to abandon Arrested Development.  I even started to think last year that maybe they were going to stick with Arrested Development until the very end.  I mean, even the Fox producers cannot deny that all Arrested really needed was to be shoved into the timeslot after American Idol for one season.  That way, when all 30 million viewers of American Idol decided to check out Arrested Development for just a couple of minutes, the rest of the country could have realized how funny it was.  But, alas, Fox decided to totally discard the show, even airing its series finale on a Friday night, the night of death in the TV world.  The only thing we can hope for now is that the success of the series on DVD motivates Fox or some other network to  re-up the show and give it the support it deserves from its network.The 3rd season is probably the second best out of the 3, close behind season 2.  This season is by far the most over-the-top, and therefore it has some of the funniest moments of the show.  Season 2 can never be matched in some ways (Ann Veal, Mrs. Featherbottom, Tony Wonder) but season 3 does an admirable job of not only keeping the funny level at the top, but it also ends the show in a satisfying way.  The weirdest thing about this season was that, at the series finale, I found myself actually caring about the characters and what happened to them.  That normally doesn't happen for a comedy show, unless the show is Seinfeld.  And that really says a lot about the writers and actors on the show.Here's hoping we get and Arrested resurrection in the near future...",5,Funniest show in the history of tv...,1156896000,"08 30, 2006",2006,1619,"['really', 'shame', 'Fox', 'decided', 'abandon', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'even', 'started', 'think', 'last', 'year', 'maybe', 'were', 'going', 'stick', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'very', 'end', 'mean', 'even', 'Fox', 'producers', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'Arrested', 'really', 'needed', 'was', 'be', 'shoved', 'timeslot', 'American', 'Idol', 'one', 'season', 'way', 'when', '30', 'million', 'viewers', 'American', 'Idol', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'just', 'couple', 'minutes', 'rest', 'country', 'could', 'have', 'realized', 'how', 'funny', 'was', 'alas', 'Fox', 'decided', 'totally', 'discard', 'show', 'even', 'airing', 'series', 'finale', 'Friday', 'night', 'night', 'death', 'TV', 'world', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'hope', 'now', 'success', 'series', 'DVD', 'Fox', 'other', 'network', 're-up', 'show', 'give', 'support', 'network.The', '3rd', 'season', 'probably', 'second', 'best', '3', 'close', 'season', '2', 'season', 'far', 'most', 'over-the-top', 'therefore', 'funniest', 'moments', 'show', 'Season', '2', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'matched', 'ways', 'Ann', 'Veal', 'Mrs.', 'Featherbottom', 'Tony', 'Wonder', 'season', '3', 'admirable', 'job', 'not', 'only', 'keeping', 'funny', 'level', 'top', 'also', 'show', 'satisfying', 'way', 'weirdest', 'thing', 'season', 'was', 'series', 'finale', 'found', 'actually', 'caring', 'characters', 'what', 'happened', 'normally', ""n't"", 'happen', 'comedy', 'show', 'show', 'Seinfeld', 'really', 'lot', 'writers', 'actors', 'show.Here', 'hoping', 'get', 'Arrested', 'resurrection', 'near', 'future']",Arrested Development: Season 3

Every episode is high on energy and the writing has shades of The Simpsons and the hilarious 70s sitcom, Soap.Unfortunately, this show only received a brief late night run here in Australia (like Curb Your Enthusiasm) before being taken off the screen. It probably didn't help that such an energetic show (with episodes under 22 minutes) was constantly interrupted with commercial breaks. Doesn't matter though, as the best way to watch it is in fact on DVD, as the quickly addicted viewer can see a few episodes in a row and rewind scenes when not every gag was picked up on the first time.Season three is highly recommended as it is full of the same wicked humour and dysfunctional characters that made the first two seasons so brilliant.

Smith Jr.,"[0, 0]","I guess if your show doesn't have someone getting voted off these days, then the idiots in charge vote the show off of the air.There is no need to reiterating point by point why this show was great, or how sad it is that the world was not ready for it so it was not picked up.  Anyone reading this knows these things, so it would be preaching to the choir.I think one strength needs to be pointed out.  More than most T.V. to DVD compilations, the Arrested Development series has great re-watch ability.  This is not a joke show that hits you over the head with a punch line and then allows the laugh track to let you know it is time to chuckle.  The jokes are subtle and often layered.  Three people in the room watching this show can be laughing at the same time and everyone might be laughing about different things.  I have watched seasons one and two front to back at least three times, and each time I can't believe that I missed some comment, or reference or absurd juxtaposition of events that can bring out belly laughs.  The bottom line is that these DVDs will not be relegated to some shelf after one viewing (unless you are part the dense upper echelon of the FOX network), but will come out often and generate laughter each time like you are seeing them for the first time.Be glad that we have the DVDs to prove to future T.V. watchers that all television didn't always suck... at least for a great but short three years in the early 21st century.",5,buy every season to archive the sliver of time when T.V. didn't suck,1156896000,"08 30, 2006",2006,1460,"['guess', 'show', ""n't"", 'have', 'someone', 'getting', 'voted', 'days', 'then', 'idiots', 'charge', 'vote', 'show', 'air.There', 'need', 'reiterating', 'point', 'point', 'why', 'show', 'was', 'great', 'how', 'sad', 'world', 'was', 'not', 'ready', 'was', 'not', 'picked', 'up', 'Anyone', 'reading', 'things', 'would', 'be', 'preaching', 'choir.I', 'think', 'one', 'strength', 'be', 'pointed', 'out', 'More', 'most', 'T.V', 'DVD', 'compilations', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'series', 'great', 're-watch', 'ability', 'not', 'joke', 'show', 'head', 'punch', 'line', 'then', 'laugh', 'track', 'let', 'know', 'time', 'chuckle', 'jokes', 'are', 'subtle', 'often', 'layered', 'Three', 'people', 'room', 'watching', 'show', 'can', 'be', 'laughing', 'same', 'time', 'everyone', 'might', 'be', 'laughing', 'different', 'things', 'have', 'watched', 'seasons', 'one', 'two', 'front', 'back', 'least', 'three', 'times', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'missed', 'comment', 'reference', 'absurd', 'juxtaposition', 'events', 'can', 'bring', 'out', 'belly', 'bottom', 'line', 'DVDs', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'relegated', 'shelf', 'one', 'viewing', 'are', 'part', 'dense', 'upper', 'echelon', 'FOX', 'network', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'often', 'generate', 'laughter', 'time', 'are', 'seeing', 'first', 'time.Be', 'glad', 'have', 'DVDs', 'prove', 'future', 'T.V', 'watchers', 'television', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'suck', 'least', 'great', 'short', 'three', 'years', 'early', '21st', 'century']",Arrested Development: Season 3

980137,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B000EXDS7K,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[270, 296]","Unfortunately, I didn't get into Arrested Development until late in its second season.  However, I was immediately hooked.  I could see that it was a completely new kind of show, and far from your average sitcom.  It's one of the few comedy series I've seen that is serialized, meaning that events of one episode carry over into the next episode.  Also, it is probably the only comedy I know that, in addition to constantly referencing past jokes, it actually references FUTURE jokes!  The show is done without a laugh track and is shot as a documentary, so the characters in the show sometimes react to the camera, and the camera sometimes reactions to situations in the show.The second season ended brilliantly with George Bluth, Sr. (Jeffry Tambor) fooling authorities into arresting and incarcerating his twin brother Oscar (also Tambor).  George's children Michael (Jason Bateman), GOB (Will Arnet), Lindsay (Portia de Rossi), and Buster (Tony Hale) vowed not to visit their ""father"" in prison for a few months so that he couldn't manipulate him.  Meanwhile, Lindsay's husband Tobias (David Cross) left for Vegas with George Sr's secretary Kitty (Judy Greer) to join the Blue Man Group.  Also, cousins George Michael (Michael Cera) and Maeby (Alia Shawkat) shared their first passionate kiss.  Season three starts off Michael going to prison to visit his ""father"" for the first time in 3 months to tell him that the Bluth Developing Company is bouncing back.  While there, he realizes that it is really Oscar behind bars, so he takes his son George Michael on a hunt for the real George Sr.  Upon finding him, the government allows George Sr. to remain under house arrest so that he can reconnect with his wife Lucille (Jessica Walter).  George immediately regrets the decision.  Meanwhile, GOB is unknowingly reunited with his illegitimate son Steve Holt (Justin Grant Wade), a classmate of George Michael and Maeby who began searching for his father in the previous year after GOB made fun of him for not having a father (IRONY!).  This starts a great arc involving GOB and Steve who are the perfect duo until GOB realizes who Steve really is.Soon, Michael starts dating a British woman named Rita (Charlize Theron) whom he meets while investigating his father's claim that a British building company set him up to take the fall for building some houses in Iraq.  As Michael's relationship with Rita develops, we learn that there may be more to her than she is saying, especially since her creepy ""uncle"" Trevor (Dave Thomas) follows the couple around everywhere.As the season develops, viewers finally find out the (most probable) cause of death for Michael's late wife Tracy, Tobias gets hair plugs, which nearly kill him, J. Walter Weatherman (Steve Ryan) makes his triumphant return, and one of the greatest ""gimmick"" episodes of televions ever is created.  The episode S.O.B.s, which stands for Save Our Bluths, is a parody of the various gimmicks that television shows use to get more ratings.  There are numerous guest stars, most of whom are only on-screen for about a second, numerous references to the much-more-popular Desperate Housewives, a live segment, some 3D segments, and even a death!  In the commercial for the episode right before it aired (which is fortunately included in the set, because it adds humor to the episode and not seeing it would make one of the Narrator's lines a little confusing), announcers said that ""one of these characters would die"", and there was a quick montage of most of the main characters and a few side characters.  Turns out that the person who died was introduced in that episode and may not have even had a line of dialogue.  Also, a lot of fans were hoping that HBO or Showtime would pick the show up, and there were allusions to that speculation in the episode.The last four episodes of the season may be some of the best in the show's history.  Featuring guest stars such as Judge Reinhold, William Hung (in probably his greatest use ever), Justine Bateman (Jason's sister), Richard Belzer (playing his Detective John Munch character), and Ron Howard, making his first on-screen appearance on the show, we finally find out the truth about George Sr's crimes, and Annyong Bluth (Justin Lee) delivers one of the finest twists imaginable.While the season started off a little slow, it became amazing, and, despite it's brevity, may be the best season of the show.  Every episode from ""The Ocean Walker"" to ""Harboring Resentment"" (also known as ""Development Arrested"") were pure gold.  The show's writers are all geniuses.  I don't know where some of the jokes were coming from, but they sure know how to come up with some hilariously bizarre situations.  The year, in addition to coming up with great new jokes, expanded a lot on past jokes.  One of my favorites was that GOB's puppet Franklin became an actual character in a sense, as opposed to a gag.  Franklin even has his own fanbase now (I'm one of them).  Unfortunately, due to the fact that the season was cut down to 13 episodes, there were plenty of things that the writers weren't able to do.  In the season premiere, there allusions to Buster getting a new hand, after losing it to a seal last year (pay attention to the scene when GOB and Steve Holt meet up for the first time).After all three seasons of unsuccessful ratings, FOX finally killed the show.  While I am very upset, I guess I have to hand it to FOX for sticking with the show for so long (from a ratings stand-point, it should have been killed after season 1).  They believed in its greatness enough to give it so many chances (oddly, they didn't really advertise for it, which probably hurt the ratings), and at least it went out still at the top of its game.  There are still rumors going around that Showtime is planning on picking it up, so we may yet see some more of this great show.  If not though, at least the writers tied up all the loose ends and even hinted at a possible movie.  If you've never seen Arrested Development, it is beyond worth checking out.  It is my favorite comedy show of all time, surpassing even mainstream hits like The Simpsons and Seinfeld as well as the quirky and underrated Scrubs.

No. It still is one of the greatest shows of all time, and even though the show will live on forever for the sixty or so people who religiously watched it every week on three well packaged DVD sets, there is still a sense of sadness that is indeed it.Season 3 of ""Arrested Development"" is as strong as seasons one and two and somehow it's even more complicated. It is nigh impossible to accuratley describe what goes on in this season to someone who hasn't watched yet, do not worry about a dip in quality. Although one episode here, the first one to establish the Charlize Thereon arc(although as it progresses it only gets better and better), is in my opinion the weakest in the shows cannon, the show never really falters. For proof take a look at the episode ""S.O.B.'s"" to see possibly one of the funniest(and at the same time saddest) half hours in the history of television.The set includes a behind the scenes look at the last day on the set, which basically just has the actors looking sad, and three commentary tracks that follow the template of the ones featured on the first two seasons discs, but this is a show that really doesn't really need any shiny features to make it a worthy purchase. The show is enough in and of itself.If you are a fan of ""AD"" then this is a no brainer purchase.

Fox wanted to cancel it but a grassroots campaign convinced them otherwise.  Still, Fox treated the show poorly by immediately cutting the order from 22 to 13 episodes, then moving it to Monday at 8pm into the lion's den of comedy TV night, then took it off for weeks for baseball, then off again for November sweeps, then gave it the bum's rush by playing all 4 final episodes on yet another night (Friday) against the opening ceremonies of the Olympics!No respect, I tell yah!The season starts right where the masterful 2nd season left off with ""The Cabin"", but part way into the second episode, the writing became noticeably suspect and uncharacteristic-- not novel, but a bit on the lame side.  Adding to the problem, they cast Charlize Theron to play the role of Bateman's love interest, and the character and surrounding Wee Britain is virtually laugh free and cartoonish.  And that took up a fair share of 5 episodes.Don't get me wrong however, there are still many classic laughs, just no where near the consistent quality, density and flow of the first two seasons.

Thanks to sinking ratings, the critically acclaimed, Emmy winning show was finally axed by Fox after struggling for three seasons.  However, creator Mitchell Hurwitz and co. poked fun at their own demise with runaway glee.  The season picks up where the second season left off: George Sr. (Jeffrey Tambor) is on the run while his twin brother Oscar (also Tambor) sits in prison, and Michael (Jason Bateman) tries to sort everything out.  Lindsay (Portia de Rossi) is off after her runaway husband (David Cross), and George Michael (Michael Cera) and Maeby (Alia Shawkat) experience a new kind of awkwardness after their first kiss.  Oh yeah, in case you don't know by now, they're cousins.  Yeah, it's business as usual for the much maligned Bluth family.  In the meantime, G.O.B. (Will Arnett) judges over an Inner-Beauty Pagent, Buster (Tony Hale) goes into a fake coma, Michael meets a woman who may be his long lost older sister (real life sister Justine Bateman), Lucille (Jessica Walter) has plans to show the family in a newer, better light (which doesn't go very well), and Michael and Buster venture to Iraq to save G.O.B. and learn just what George Sr. has been behind over the years, as well as who is the real brains of the family.  The series comes to an end the way many would expect, with most of the loose ends tied up, but with an open window as well for the series to return in a different medium, hopefully (please, please).  There's plenty of guest stars throughout this season, most notably the beautiful Charlize Theron as a love interest for Michael who may be more (or less) than she seems, and Scott Baio as a divorce lawyer for Tobias and Lindsay.

980204,A2K7ETEIA4AB5R,B000EXDS7K,"PTR ""papapossum""","[17, 25]","Now that my copy has sold on Amazon Marketplace, I can let loose with my bitter, bitter disappointment with the third season of this show. The first two seasons of Arrested Development was the funniest stuff I ever saw on American television. But this third season was simply not the same program. Never has the change of a show's writers been more abjectly evident in the quality of humor.Some of the previous reviewers have pointed this out, but the over-whelming majority of those who have been writing here have used this as a soapbox to castigate Fox for cancelling the show. On one level, that's understandable, but I've found very few reviewers willing to admit that Season 3 just isn't that funny.There seemed to be an emphasis on being ""clever"" rather than laugh-out-loud funny. I found the incessant, non-stop sexual innuendo/double entendre -- usually of the homoerotic variety -- to be a lame subsitute for actual humor. Were we really expected to burst into laughter at that stuff? It was like watching a ""Worst Of"" SNL special.The ""Call back"" technique -- where actions, dialogue, etc, of previous episodes is referenced again -- was way overdone. Again, if it had been written in such a way that it was funny, it would have been different. But using call-back just for the sake of doing it is pointless.There were some laughs -- the Tiny Town episode was probably the best.

I've seen all 4 seasons multiple times, know the running jokes by heart, and can talk extensively about the humor and foreshadowing in the show.Season 3, in my opinion, is probably the weakest of the 4 seasons. Subplots drag on longer than they should, some main plot elements are breezed through quickly, and at times it feels like the writing is based around the concept of it being cancelled rather than presenting a good story. That being said, however, the show is still great. The humor is still there. Some great lines and running gags are developed. Plus the last four episodes really do give the show a proper (at the time) ending that feels right for the show.

The crazy misadventures of the dysfunctional Bluth family come to a close in ""Arrested Development: Season Three"". Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman) is the good son of real estate tycoon George Bluth (Jeffrey Tambor) who is arrested for numerous criminal activities. While investigating his father's claim that he isn't the mastermind behind these criminal actions, Michael desperately tries to keep order among his unruly relatives and improve his relationship with his teenage son. Produced by acclaimed director Ron Howard, ""Arrested Development"" is the funniest well written comedy since ""Seinfeld"". Despite winning two Emmy awards, the critically acclaimed sitcom failed to find an audience since its premiere in 2003. The third season of ""Arrested Development"" was cut back to 13 episodes from its standard 22-episode season run. Though the third season isn't as outstanding as the earlier seasons, it still delivers some creative storylines, outrageous characters and uproariously funny moments. The final season also includes such memorable episodes like ""The Ocean Walker"", ""Making a Stand"", ""Family Ties"" and ""Development Arrested"".The critically acclaimed comedy sitcom ""Arrested Development"" might be gone but you can still relive all its great humor on DVD.

Thank God I can watch it again.  In Season 3, Fox moved this show around so many times, I had trouble taping all of them on my old-school VCR  (although I'm sure glad I got the last 4 episodes, even though Fox buried them next to the opening ceremony of the Olympics and then didn't advertise them).  BUT, you fans out there know how great it is to have them on DVD.Season 3 was stellar.  I've read a little griping that the quality slipped a little...okay, maybe from A+++ to A+.  Still pretty darn good.  The only story line that tired me a little bit was the stuff with Charlize Theron.  She's a decent actress, but I found her British accent unconvincing, and I thought the story line went on too long.Other than that, I've got no complaints.  The episode where George Michael ends up in a retro looking flying jetpack, and flies over a miniature model home park while crashing into Tobias dressed in a monster costume was so funny I wept.  No joke.  I did not think it was possible to find 30 seconds of TV so funny.  We watched it over and over.The final four episodes, when the story finally wrapped itself up pretty well, include wonderful trips to Iraq, fantastic guest appearances (including a very nice turn from Justine Bateman) and crisp, crisp acting all around.It's almost futile to describe the show.  If you haven't seen it, you MUST watch it, but you must start with Disc 1.  My family and I have had ARRESTED marathons...when Season 1 came out, we watched in one day, and later the same with Season 2.  I know season 3 will be the same.  They fly by, and you can see all the many little jokes you missed the first time, mostly because you were too busy laughing at the other jokes.  This is NOT an exaggeration...the show is that packed with energy.Yes, it is a shame to see it go.  I'll miss all the incredibly talented cast and characters.  But in some ways, it might be a blessing.  I can only imagine the creative and logistical effort that went into it...how could that be sustained?  And even though Fox kinda gave up on it mid season...they DID promote it a lot before then.  And magazines raved about it.  And it cleaned up award after award.  But people didn't tune in...you can't blame Fox for cutting its losses (although WHY ""The War at Home"" or ""Stacked"" lasted more than 2 episodes each I don't know).  Remember, Fox has stuck by ""Malcolm in the Middle"" and ""King of the Hill"" for many years past when their ratings dropped.  Overall, I can't be too upset with them.I'd sure feel different, though, if ARRESTED wasn't out on DVD!!  This is a MUST OWN if there ever was such a thing!!

980216,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B000EXDS7K,Robert I. Hedges,"[1, 1]","I love ""Arrested Development"" and consider it to be one of the most original, funny, offbeat, and intelligent television shows of all time. Having said that, I waffled between a four and five star rating for season three solely because while great, it still wasn't quite up to the amazingly high standards of the first two seasons. In the end, though, I couldn't bring myself to give it anything less than five stars, because it just isn't fair to punish the third season simply because the first two seasons were so far off the charts and warranted a rating greater than five stars.Season three is shorter than the first two seasons, and the jokes are both a bit more biting, and a bit more off-color compared to the earlier shows. As always, Ron Howard's narration is a clear winner, and helps viewers new to the show to get their bearings on what's going on. One of the chief delights of the show for me is the long-running plotlines that span seasons: this season they become even more otherworldly and convoluted. Jason Bateman is a great actor and centers the off-kilter ensemble cast. This season he dates a British woman (Charlize Theron) and explores the British section of Orange County, in a lengthy subplot that was my least favorite of the entire series. I never thought this story helped flesh out Michael's character, nor did it further the flow of the show in what was an already truncated and busy season.As always I loved Jeffrey Tambor as the lunatic patriarch of the Bluth family, and especially enjoyed the subplot about his trial for treason and the bizarre aftereffects of his dealings in Iraq. The guest stars this season were also great and included luminaries like James Lipton and Andy Richter. My favorite piece of casting was Scott Baio as attorney Bob Loblaw (who even has his own Internet site, the ""Bob Loblaw Law Blog""). Baio is brilliant here, as is Justine Bateman who makes a sultry appearance in an amazing turn of events. The entire cast is strong, the vast majority of the material is great (the rest is very good), and the finale is totally unexpected, which is exactly what you would expect from ""Arrested Development.""

980217,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000EXDS7K,Robert Moore,"[18, 21]","Warning:  A world of spoilersWe just learned on Mar. 24 that Michael Hurwitz has declined to run ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT on Showtime, which means that the show as we knew it for the past three years truly has ended.  Showtime's offer to renew the show on their network was contingent upon Hurwitz staying with the show.  If they stick with that requirement, the show truly is done.  Executive Producer (and Narrator) Ron Howard has indicated that he would like to keep the show alive and that Hurwitz has agreed to stay on as a consultant if Howard is able to work out a deal with Showtime to continue the show on other terms.  So, while things are looking bleak, the Fat Lady hasn't sung quite yet.  She is, however, warming up in the wings.  And to be honest, I'm not sure how I would feel about ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT without Michael Hurwitz.  It would be like BUFFY without Joss Whedon or LOST without Damon Lindelhof and Carlton Cuse (forget J. J. Abrams, they are the ones running the show).  Still, I'd definitely give it a try.  A show isn't made by only one person, and it is possible that if the cast stayed with the show and much of the rest of the creative team, the show might yet continue to catch lightening in a bottle.With one qualification, I utterly disagree with those who saw a decline in Season Three.  To me the plot lines were getting better, not worse.  The episodes involving Charlize Theron were for me among the finest in the entire run of the show, funny both as a general plot line and hysterical in the almost impossible number of details.  These, like those of the first two seasons, are episodes that you can watch repeatedly, picking up new details along the way.  For instance, when Michael and Rita go to the ""American"" restaurant in Little England they are served what I imagine to be their version of ""authentic"" American cuisine.  In front of each of them is a plate filled with impossibly sugary looking donuts.  The brilliance of the show is that they don't call any attention to the absurd ""meal"" but leave it in the background.  I will grant, however, that in the final four episodes the plot lines started feeling a bit rushed, as they were forced not only to collapse the season's plot into only a few episodes but create an appropriate ending for the series as a whole in case they decide not to continue the show on Showtime.  In that sense the third season falls a tiny bit short of the others, but I have to cut them some slack here.  If they had had a full 22 episodes or even the 18 that Season Two had I think it would have equaled the first two in every way.Season Three, in fact, is in some ways the funniest of the three seasons.  The jokes became even more cutting and painfully funny.  Even now I can't think of Bob Boblaw (if you haven't seen those episodes say the name out loud) without snickering, let alone Tobias's comment:  ""Bob Boblaw's web log.  Wow, you're a mouthful.""  Our learning of the mysterious ""Mr. F"" and the eventual denouement is one of the best moments in the series, as well as one of the saddest.  A host of images from the season are impossible for me to forget.  Gob's puppet with the sign reading ""George Bush doesn't care for black puppets"" hanging around its neck.  Tobias's unhappy experience in getting hair plugs.  Or Michael asking George-Michael, in a wonderful parody of the first episode:Michael:  What have I always said is the most important thing?George-Michael:  Family.Michael:  No, breakfast.Other funny moments include Lindsay's stating that she had to finish a bottle of vodka because, as her mother had taught her, if you didn't drink a bottle once opened it would go bad.  Also, that wine turned into alcohol if you didn't drink it quickly.  Funniest of all, and perhaps the scene that caused me to laugh harder than I have on anything else I have ever seen on American TV, was the utterly strange, surreal encounter between what appeared to be looking out the window of the model home a fight between a gigantic mole monster and some strange massive alien with a jet pack.One thing that wasn't always commented on was the fact that unlike situation comedies, ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT did have a definite story to tell.  The story wasn't the main point, but it did structure everything that was done in the three seasons.  Briefly, we learn that George Bluth was falsely arrested for having committed treason through building houses for Saddam Hussein.  We also learn that Michael and Lindsay were not really twins as they had always imagined and that George-Michael and Maebe, who accidentally married one another, were not biologically related.  By the end of the day, it was one heck of a wild ride.I sincerely hope that Michael Hurwitz will take Showtime's offer.  In my opinion this truly is the finest comedy in the history of American TV and can only be rivaled by MONTY PYTHON and FAWLTY TOWERS in British television.  The show is still incredibly fresh and full of potential for more insanity and nuttiness.  With so many bad things in the world, the human race could stand a few more laughs.The whole ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT debacle adds another chapter in the tacky history of FOX.  The network has done a great job of development fascinating and innovative shows, but all too often abuses them.  FOX truly has become the network that a host of people absolutely loathes and detests.  I am still bitter over the early cancellation of FIREFLY, which might have become one of the most fascinating shows in the history of TV.  Ditto with WONDERFALLS, cancelled after only four episodes were broadcast, though thirteen were filmed.  Or going back further, the cancellation of DARK ANGEL after only two seasons, or the cancellation of FAMILY GUY and FUTURAMA (though massive DVD sales did bring FAMILY GUY back).  Now we can add ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT to the list.  How FOX could fail to value and promote and treasure what is quite probably the finest comedy America has ever produced is beyond me.  You would think that a show that in only two seasons had won a shelf of Emmys and Golden Globes would have been immune to cancellation.  But never put anything past FOX.  It isn't just the shows that FOX disrespects:  they disrespect us fans.",5,Tops the list of shows taht ended too soon,1142726400,"03 19, 2006",2006,6238,"['Warning', 'world', 'spoilersWe', 'just',

980220,AGSWTH7SP2256,B000EXDS7K,R. W. Rasband,"[9, 11]","I was a latecomer to ""Arrested Development""; when I first watched it on Fox I didn't get it right away.  It wasn't until I got the DVD's for season 1 and watched them all at once one weekend that I truly saw this series' genius.  It's like a sprawling comic novel that creates an entire goofy world that is the context for the outrageous (yet weirdly lovable) behavior of the Bluths, America's most dysfunctional wealthy family.  It should be compared to a book like John Kennedy Toole's ""A Confederacy of Dunces"" rather than the usual lame TV sitcom.  This sounds pretentious I know; but ""Arrested Development"" really is art that rewards your sustained attention.  Each episode of loaded with little jokes that only become apparent with repeated viewings (and the freeze-frame of a DVD player.)  The cumulative effect left me literally gasping with laughter, especially every time David Cross opens his piehole, so to speak.This final, wonderful season has Oscar-winner Charlize Theron as Michael's hideously inappropriate fiance, a storyline that has you in stitches and cringing with embarassment at the same time.  I especially loved the classic episode ""S.O.B.'s"" in which the Bluths ponder their own unlikability and precarious ratings situation in a hilariously meta-fictional way (with Andy Richter guest-starring as the Richter brothers; you have to see it to believe it.)Journalist Steven Johnson in his book ""Everything Bad Is Good For You"" says that today's popular culture (especially video games and other computer-based entertainment) is producing new generations of more cognitively sophisticated Americans.  You have to get smarter to appreciate complex, multifaceted and multitasking television shows like ""The Sopranos"" and ""Lost"".  The same applies to ""Arrested Development.""  Althogh in one sense the show is a throwback to the dense, novelistic demands of textual language, it's also the future of television comedy.
