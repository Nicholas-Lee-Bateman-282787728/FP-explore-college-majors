I've seen his movies and some of his tv work. he is definitely one of a kind. I liked this movie very much, easily the best movie about James Dean. Casper Van Dien potrayed him flawlessly. He did have a darker side most fans are not aware of. He actually had an obsession with death and was good friends with  TV's Vampira among other things. He was very good racer, no telling how many trophys he would've brought home if he had lived. The only thing about this movie is it should have been longer, but other than that it's great. George Barris himself Customized the Porsche Spyder 550 for the movie. Also this was Robert Mitchum's last movie before he died, he was an acting legend in his own right. Check it out, it's definitely worth it. James Dean's legacy will live on!",5,very good film,1176249600,"04 11, 2007",2007,849,"['Let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'James', 'Dean', 'i', 'was', 'kid', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movies', 'tv', 'work', 'definitely', 'one', 'kind', 'liked', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'easily', 'best', 'movie', 'James', 'Dean', 'Casper', 'Van', 'Dien', 'potrayed', 'flawlessly', 'did', 'have', 'darker', 'side', 'most', 'fans', 'are', 'not', 'aware', 'actually', 'had', 'obsession', 'death', 'was', 'good', 'friends', 'TV', 'Vampira', 'other', 'things', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'racer', 'telling', 'how', 'many', 'trophys', 'would', ""'ve"", 'brought', 'home', 'had', 'lived', 'only', 'thing', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'longer', 'other', 'great', 'George', 'Barris', 'Customized', 'Porsche', 'Spyder', '550', 'movie', 'Also', 'was', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'last', 'movie', 'died', 'was', 'acting', 'legend', 'own', 'right', 'Check', 'out', 'definitely', 'worth', 'James', 'Dean', 'legacy', 'will', 'live']",N/A

I've seen many documentaries on James Dean, as he's my favorite actor, and try to read up in him as much as possible. This film I found very distasteful and poorly done however. Id give it 0 stars if that was even possible. Casper Van Dien makes James Dean look like a whiny, childlike, obnoxious boy. The plot is very unrealistic, and any fan of James Dean would agree. Sure, pier angeli was the one true love of his life, one that could never be recreated on the screen in my opinion. The only part of the film I find amusing is the fact that I wasted money on this horrible piece of crap called a movie. If you want to be given a vague, unrealistic view of who James Dean was, watch this film. It will forever change the way you see biographical films. James Dean is an American icon, a hero in my eyes. This film ruins him. Take my advice: if you just now have found out about James Dean, don't watch this film. It will give you the wrong impression of who he really was.",1,A very poor depiction of James Dean,1375228800,"07 31, 2013",2013,1111,"['James', 'Dean', 'was', 'very', 'complex', 'person', 'was', 'polite', 'yet', 'rude', 'lonely', 'yet', 'charming', 'very', 'difficult', 'part', 'play', 'young', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'documentaries', 'James', 'Dean', 'favorite', 'actor', 'try', 'read', 'up', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'film', 'found', 'very', 'distasteful', 'poorly', 'done', 'however', 'Id', 'give', '0', 'stars', 'was', 'even', 'possible', 'Casper', 'Van', 'Dien', 'James', 'Dean', 'look', 'whiny', 'childlike', 'obnoxious', 'boy', 'plot', 'very', 'unrealistic', 'fan', 'James', 'Dean', 'would', 'agree', 'Sure', 'pier', 'angeli', 'was', 'one', 'true', 'love', 'life', 'one', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'recreated', 'screen', 'opinion', 'only', 'part', 'film', 'find', 'amusing', 'fact', 'wasted', 'money', 'horrible', 'piece', 'crap', 'called', 'movie', 'want', 'be', 'given', 'vague', 'unrealistic', 'view', 'who', 'James', 'Dean', 'was', 'watch', 'film', 'will', 'forever', 'change', 'way', 'see', 'biographical', 'films', 'James', 'Dean', 'American', 'icon', 'hero', 'eyes', 'film', 'Take', 'advice', 'just', 'now', 'have', 'found', 'out', 'James', 'Dean', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'film', 'will', 'give', 'wrong', 'impression', 'who', 'really', 'was']",N/A

The only reason I saw this film is because my wife picked it up for a dollar.The film makes James Dean look like a jerk.  I'll give you an example.  He is in love with an Italian girl, and in front of her mother he insults Italians by referring to one as a pasta head.He is a self centered and annoying jerk throughout much of the movie.  Reading other reviews on this site, it seems that he wasn't that way in real life.Also, I remember reading somewhere that he had a terrible relationship with his foster parents, and that he received a lot of beatings.  In this film, his dad is just peachy with him.  If they can't even get that right, I have to wonder who this film is about.There is an ultra phony scene where James Dean makes a tough guy basically quack like a duck.  He tells the tough guy to admit that he is a yellow chicken, and the guy does, all because James Dean is holding a finger against the guy's eye.  What a stupid scene.  The guy should have grabbed his hand and pulled it away from his eye, and then socked him.  How stupid was this?  You can't just stand there holding your finger to someone's eye.  It simply doesn't work.  Either you poke the man's eye or you get your hand pulled away, one or the other.  It is not difficult to pull someone's hand away from your damn eye and move your head back.The whole movie was intent on portraying James Dean as some tough guy with an attitude, rebel without a cause.  It was just stupid.  That was the name of a movie.  That wasn't the biography of a three dimensional man.The love of his life, Pier Angeli, came off as an idiot, even moreso than Dean.  She loved Dean but she married Vic Damone because her mother told her to.  What?  What century were these people living in?  That was ridiculous.  If I am to believe these characters as presented, I can feel no sympathy for that moronic girl, but only scorn, and wish her the worst.  Too bad she didn't get killed in a car wreck.  Moron.All in all, a frustrating and stupid movie.  I was rooting against the characters because they were so damn annoying and stupid.  I was wishing them the worst.  A nice happy ending would have been for them all to fall in quicksand and sink.",2,Pretty bad movie,1136073600,"01 1, 2006",2006,2262,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'James', 'Dean', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'only', 'reason', 'saw', 'film', 'wife', 'picked', 'up', 'dollar.The', 'film', 'James', 'Dean', 'look', 'jerk', ""'ll"", 'give', 'example', 'love', 'Italian', 'girl', 'front', 'mother', 'Italians', 'referring', 'one', 'pasta', 'head.He', 'self', 'centered', 'annoying', 'jerk', 'much', 'movie', 'Reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'site', 'was', ""n't"", 'way', 'real', 'life.Also', 'remember', 'reading', 'somewhere', 'had', 'terrible', 'relationship', 'foster', 'parents', 'received', 'lot', 'beatings', 'film', 'dad', 'just', 'peachy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'right', 'have', 'wonder', 'who', 'film', 'about.There', 'ultra', 'phony', 'scene', 'where', 'James', 'Dean', 'tough', 'guy', 'basically', 'quack', 'duck', 'tough', 'guy', 'admit', 'yellow', 'chicken', 'guy', 'James', 'Dean', 'holding', 'finger', 'guy', 'eye', 'What', 'stupid', 'scene', 'guy', 'should', 'have', 'grabbed', 'hand', 'pulled', 'away', 'eye', 'then', 'socked', 'How', 'stupid', 'was', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'stand', 'there', 'holding', 'finger', 'someone', 'eye', 'simply', ""n't"", 'work', 'poke', 'man', 'eye', 'get', 'hand', 'pulled', 'away', 'one', 'other', 'not', 'difficult', 'pull', 'someone', 'hand', 'away', 'damn', 'eye', 'move', 'head', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'intent', 'portraying', 'James', 'Dean', 'tough', 'guy', 'attitude', 'rebel', 'cause', 'was', 'just', 'stupid', 'was', 'name', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'biography', 'three', 'dimensional', 'man.The', 'love', 'life', 'Pier', 'Angeli', 'came', 'off', 'idiot', 'even', 'moreso', 'Dean', 'loved', 'Dean', 'married', 'Vic', 'Damone', 'mother', 'told', 'What', 'What', 'century', 'were', 'people', 'living', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'am', 'believe', 'characters', 'presented', 'can', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'moronic', 'girl', 'only', 'scorn', 'wish', 'worst', 'Too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'killed', 'car', 'wreck', 'Moron.All', 'frustrating', 'stupid', 'movie', 'was', 'rooting', 'characters', 'were', 'so', 'damn', 'annoying', 'stupid', 'was', 'wishing', 'worst', 'nice', 'happy', 'ending', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fall', 'quicksand', 'sink']",N/A

Everyone knows and agrees that the Franco version is excellent and the best of all the  James Dean films, but this movie is far from being as bad as most people  seem to think it is.In fact I think that it is underrated and uncredited in many areas.This film is hated by a lot of Dean fans who feel that Casper made a horrible Jimmy.I don't agree.I don't think there is a person on the face of the Earth that can accurately portray the greatness and magnetism that is Jimmy. James Franco came closest, but Casper did not do a bad job. I'm a fan of Casper's too and I think that he did a fair job here.Carrie Mitchum was the perfect Pier Angeli.She was fantastic .She was the perfect Pier . She is similar in stature  to Pier and her accent was perfect. She even looks like Pier a bit.She has played  the role of Pier  the best so far hands down... What is most overlooked and underappreciated about this film though is its deep exploration of the romance between Jimmy and Pier.  Its the major part of the story here and no other Jimmy film so far has devoted this much time to the Jimmy/Pier romance or delved this deeply into it.And as a Jimmy/Pier fan, I really love and appreciate that.I think that their romance hasn't  been depicted enough in either books or film.And for those two things alone, the film deserves a lot of credit and praise.The film is a lovely tribute to their love.The soundtrack is full of 50s Music.And the transfer to DVD is really bright and clear with great sound.Before I wrap up my  review, I'd like to comment on a couple of mistakes  made by my fellow Reviewers. I don't think the film necessarily depicted Natalie Wood badly. By her own admission, she had a big crush on Jimmy and she often flirted with him almost the entire time she knew him.That has been stated in many books.And Jimmy did see and speak to Pier again at least a few times after they broke up. They spoke on the phone while she was in the hospitalafter being injured on a plane while she was pregnant and a  couple of Jimmy's friends saw her over at his house  not long before he died. That in the book Little Boy Lost if anyone cares to read it.Just thought it was important to clear those things up.",3,A decent James Dean Biopic,1148774400,"05 28, 2006",2006,2597,"['just', 'bought', 'movie', 'DVD', 'had', 'seen', 'TV', '4', 'years', 'ago.Since', 'had', 'seen', 'obviously', 'liked', 'well', 'enough', 'buy', 'it.Let', 'start', 'out', 'saying', 'am', 'huge', 'James', 'Dean', 'Fan.As', 'far', 'know', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'only', '3', 'movies', 'made', 'James', '-this', 'one', 'James', 'Franco', '2001', 'version', '1976', 'TV', 'film.I', 'have', 'not', 'seen', '1976', 'version', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'Everyone', 'Franco', 'version', 'excellent', 'best', 'James', 'Dean', 'films', 'movie', 'far', 'being', 'as', 'bad', 'most', 'people', 'seem', 'think', 'is.In', 'fact', 'think', 'underrated', 'uncredited', 'many', 'areas.This', 'film', 'hated', 'lot', 'Dean', 'fans', 'who', 'feel', 'Casper', 'made', 'horrible', 'Jimmy.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'person', 'face', 'Earth', 'can', 'accurately', 'portray', 'greatness', 'magnetism', 'Jimmy', 'James', 'Franco', 'came', 'closest', 'Casper', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'bad', 'job', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Casper', 'too', 'think', 'did', 'fair', 'job', 'here.Carrie', 'Mitchum', 'was', 'perfect', 'Pier', 'Angeli.She', 'was', 'fantastic', '.She', 'was', 'perfect', 'Pier', 'similar', 'stature', 'Pier', 'accent', 'was', 'perfect', 'even', 'Pier', 'bit.She', 'played', 'role', 'Pier', 'best', 'so', 'far', 'down', 'What', 'most', 'overlooked', 'underappreciated', 'film', 'though', 'deep', 'exploration', 'romance', 'Jimmy', 'Pier', 'major', 'part', 'story', 'here', 'other', 'Jimmy', 'film', 'so', 'far', 'devoted', 'much', 'time', 'Jimmy/Pier', 'romance', 'delved', 'deeply', 'it.And', 'Jimmy/Pier', 'fan', 'really', 'love', 'appreciate', 'that.I', 'think', 'romance', ""n't"", 'been', 'depicted', 'enough', 'books', 'film.And', 'two', 'things', 'alone', 'film', 'lot', 'credit', 'praise.The', 'film', 'lovely', 'tribute', 'love.The', 'soundtrack', 'full', '50s', 'Music.And', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'really', 'bright', 'clear', 'great', 'sound.Before', 'wrap', 'up', 'review', ""'d"", 'like', 'comment', 'couple', 'mistakes', 'made', 'fellow', 'Reviewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'necessarily', 'depicted', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'badly', 'own', 'admission', 'had', 'big', 'crush', 'Jimmy', 'often', 'flirted', 'almost', 'entire', 'time', 'knew', 'been', 'stated', 'many', 'books.And', 'Jimmy', 'did', 'see', 'speak', 'Pier', 'again', 'least', 'few', 'times', 'broke', 'up', 'spoke', 'phone', 'was', 'hospitalafter', 'being', 'injured', 'plane', 'was', 'pregnant', 'couple', 'Jimmy', 'friends', 'saw', 'over', 'house', 'not', 'long', 'died', 'book', 'Little', 'Boy', 'Lost', 'anyone', 'read', 'it.Just', 'thought', 'was', 'important', 'clear', 'things', 'up']",N/A

It's not as deep as the James Franco version, but it was still a good film.  It shows the more crazier side of Dean, which I think is completely true, because I have read about Dean and seen bios on him and a lot of people do say that he is a wierd guy and a bit crazy.  Him being a genius actor, I'm not so suprised that he is a bit crazy.  Anyway, the film did heavily go over the Pier Angeli love affair.  Though I doubt James Dean actually loved her as much as the film emphasizes, I do believe that she really loved him.  This movie didn't touch on the homosexual side of Dean, though not an appealing fact about his life, it's still part of his history.  The Franco version didn't really go over this either, but it still touched upon this part of Dean's life in a classy way.
