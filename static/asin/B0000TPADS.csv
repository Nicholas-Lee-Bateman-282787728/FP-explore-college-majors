783510,A3SOV9HFM5H9T1,B0000TPADS,Bruce P. Barten,"[36, 47]","I would think this would be PG in France or for an audience of drunks in a nightclub.  This DVD contains smoking and drinking, a few boobs, plenty of theatrical stunts, some outdoor scenery, and enough music to be considered a musical.  The film was made in 1974, when the title, ""Jacques Brel is alive and well and living in Paris"" was being overly euphemistic about his health.  Brel (1929-1978) was born in Belgium, which was occupied by Nazis for four or five years when he was growing up.  The saddest song on this DVD, ""Marieke"" retains a bit of Flemish and shows a cemetery while Elly Stone sings of someone buried in Flanders.  Brel was popular as a singer-songwriter until he was diagnosed with cancer and began to cut back his public appearances in 1967, and this film was made the year he stopped performing, though he is shown in some scenes.  If you need to know what he looks like, see him smoking in the Theatrical Trailer on the DVD, which also identifies the film stars Elly Stone, Mort Shuman, and Joe Masiell.For people who have seen the film, Mort Shuman (1937-1991) might be remembered as the singer of ""The Taxi Cab Driver"" which is selection 8 on the DVD.  Mort Shuman and Eric Blau (whose wife is singer Elly Stone) were co-producers of the theatre cabaret version of ""Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris"" which opened on January 22, 1968 at the Village Gate on Bleeker Street in Greenwich Village, where it ran for over 1800 performances.  The attempt to reach the enormous audiences on Broadway only had 51 performances, but the English adaptations of Brel songs by Mort Shuman and Eric Blau have become better known than some of the originals.  People who remember all of the music from 1968 ought to remember an album called ""Wildflowers"" on which Judy Collins sang ""La Chanson des vieux amants"" with the original words by Jacques Brel, music and words by Jacques Brel and Gerard Jouannest.  The ""Song of the Old Lovers"" is selection 23 on this DVD and allows fans to hear the words in English.  Brel worked with a number of composers for the music to his songs, and this DVD provides a variety of musical styles.Harry Chapin had a song about driving a taxi cab, too, but the tone of the ""I drive the Taxi Cab"" song on this DVD is a bit closer to the feelings of the strange hero of the movie ""Taxi Driver"" in which an ex-Marine is up all night anyway and sees what is going on at all hours, most of which he would like to flush down the toilet.  Selection 22, ""The Middle Class"" has a chorus based on the idea:  the middle class are pigs.  Already in selection 2, ""Marathon"" the force of history is emphasized with videos of a string of events that has an impact like Billy Joel singing ""We Didn't Start the Fire"" to a younger generation of MTV viewers.  For Americans who missed the plethora of anti-war feelings generated by the active involvement of millions in some stupid history lesson, the fate of Europe as complained about by ""The Statue"" in selection 4 captures the bitterness of being dead at the end of the years 1880-1918 as hatred of childhood innocence, but whoever wanted a statue in the damn park anyway?The song ""Carousel"" near the end has flashback clips from the other songs, with everything spinning around like a top as the main theme, which makes the last song a relief.  ""If We Only Have Love.""  Total time 97 minutes, and if you haven't figured out what it was about by then, you can watch the Theatrical Trailer a few times to see whose success and fame this film was attempting to capture.",5,American Film Theatre version is PG ?,1106352000,"01 22, 2005",2005,3560,"['would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'PG', 'France', 'audience', 'drunks', 'nightclub', 'DVD', 'smoking', 'drinking', 'few', 'boobs', 'plenty', 'theatrical', 'stunts', 'outdoor', 'scenery', 'enough', 'music', 'be', 'considered', 'musical', 'film', 'was', 'made', '1974', 'when', 'title', 'Jacques', 'Brel', 'alive', 'well', 'living', 'Paris', 'was', 'being', 'overly', 'euphemistic', 'health', 'Brel', '1929-1978', 'was', 'born', 'Belgium', 'was', 'occupied', 'Nazis', 'four', 'five', 'years', 'when', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'saddest', 'song', 'DVD', 'Marieke', 'bit', 'Flemish', 'cemetery', 'Elly', 'Stone', 'sings', 'someone', 'buried', 'Flanders', 'Brel', 'was', 'popular', 'singer-songwriter', 'was', 'diagnosed', 'cancer', 'began', 'cut', 'back', 'public', 'appearances', '1967', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'year', 'stopped', 'performing', 'shown', 'scenes', 'need', 'know', 'what', 'see', 'smoking', 'Theatrical', 'Trailer', 'DVD', 'also', 'film', 'stars', 'Elly', 'Stone', 'Mort', 'Shuman', 'Joe', 'Masiell.For', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'Mort', 'Shuman', '1937-1991', 'might', 'be', 'remembered', 'singer', 'Taxi', 'Cab', 'Driver', 'selection', '8', 'DVD', 'Mort', 'Shuman', 'Eric', 'Blau', 'wife', 'singer', 'Elly', 'Stone', 'were', 'co-producers', 'theatre', 'cabaret', 'version', 'Jacques', 'Brel', 'Is', 'Alive', 'Well', 'Living', 'Paris', 'opened', 'January', '22', '1968', 'Village', 'Gate', 'Bleeker', 'Street', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'where', 'ran', '1800', 'performances', 'attempt', 'reach', 'enormous', 'audiences', 'Broadway', 'only', 'had', '51', 'performances', 'English', 'adaptations', 'Brel', 'songs', 'Mort', 'Shuman', 'Eric', 'Blau', 'have', 'become', 'better', 'known', 'originals', 'People', 'who', 'remember', 'music', '1968', 'ought', 'remember', 'album', 'called', 'Wildflowers', 'Judy', 'Collins', 'sang', 'La', 'Chanson', 'vieux', 'amants', 'original', 'words', 'Jacques', 'Brel', 'music', 'words', 'Jacques', 'Brel', 'Gerard', 'Jouannest', 'Song', 'Old', 'Lovers', 'selection', '23', 'DVD', 'fans', 'hear', 'words', 'English', 'Brel', 'worked', 'number', 'composers', 'music', 'songs', 'DVD', 'variety', 'musical', 'styles.Harry', 'Chapin', 'had', 'song', 'driving', 'taxi', 'cab', 'too', 'tone', 'drive', 'Taxi', 'Cab', 'song', 'DVD', 'bit', 'closer', 'feelings', 'strange', 'hero', 'movie', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'ex-Marine', 'up', 'night', 'anyway', 'what', 'going', 'hours', 'most', 'would', 'like', 'flush', 'down', 'toilet', 'Selection', '22', 'Middle', 'Class', 'chorus', 'based', 'idea', 'middle', 'class', 'are', 'pigs', 'Already', 'selection', '2', 'Marathon', 'force', 'history', 'emphasized', 'videos', 'string', 'events', 'impact', 'Billy', 'Joel', 'singing', 'Did', ""n't"", 'Start', 'Fire', 'younger', 'generation', 'MTV', 'viewers', 'Americans', 'who', 'missed', 'plethora', 'anti-war', 'feelings', 'generated', 'active', 'involvement', 'millions', 'stupid', 'history', 'lesson', 'fate', 'Europe', 'complained', 'Statue', 'selection', '4', 'bitterness', 'being', 'dead', 'end', 'years', '1880-1918', 'hatred', 'childhood', 'innocence', 'whoever', 'wanted', 'statue', 'damn', 'park', 'anyway', 'song', 'Carousel', 'end', 'flashback', 'clips', 'other', 'songs', 'everything', 'spinning', 'top', 'main', 'theme', 'last', 'song', 'relief', 'Only', 'Have', 'Love', 'Total', 'time', '97', 'minutes', 'have', ""n't"", 'figured', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'then', 'can', 'watch', 'Theatrical', 'Trailer', 'few', 'times', 'see', 'success', 'fame', 'film', 'was', 'attempting', 'capture']",Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris

The soul and essence of Jacques Brel's extraordinary songs transposed into English for American sensibilities presented as a kind of cabaret revue.It would have been better for all concerned if they had just filmed the show that ran for four years in New York.Instead, the same team that had forged that magical show into a coherent whole, retreated into a mish-mash of absurdist vignettes abounding in the worst excesses of art-house, pseudo-psycho-pop schlock.  It is literally painful to sit through.  Then, to add insult to injury, the singing is sub-standard as well.  They should have just lip-synched to the broadway cast album, but, no - it's almost as if they were out to prove that they couldn't do anything right with this show.  Like they needed to prove that you can't go home again - you can't repeat greatness.So they turned a piece of magic into something tragic.You may not believe this film is as bad as I say.  Trust me, it is.The only reason it gets one star is because of a 5-minute segment wherein Jacques Brel himself sings ""Ne Me Quitte Pas.""

Maybe it was the way it was filmed, you know too movie-ish, rather than filming a live production of the show.  And it didn't seem the cast on the DVD was having any fun.

783515,A1N5YEQ29VU3C2,B0000TPADS,Trout26,"[0, 0]","I had the joy of being in a college production of the show back in 1980; it was my first exposure to Brel, and I fell in love with him on the spot.  I cannot count the number of times I have listened to both the original cast recording and the recording made of our performance. Even while in that production, I heard ""how bad"" the film version was, so I always avoided it.  Finally, 30+ years later, curioisity got the best of me and I watched it.  I had very mixed feelings about it.  My biggest complaint is that several of the songs from the stage version are missing, and others are inserted, likewise, the sequence of the songs has been changed. Visually, the film belongs to the avante-garde style of its time: forced symbolism, surrealistic transitions, odd camera angles, etc.  Accept it for what it is.  But what makes this film worth watching are the performances of Eli Stone and Mort Schumann, the two people primarily responsible for popularizing Brel in the US. As an added treat, Brel himself makes an appearance singing ""Non quitte pas"". Is this the film version of the show that I would make were I the director? No. But it does serve as a visual record of the original performers in the context of the era in which it was created.",4,"Not the Stage Show, but the Cast is Still Classic",1303516800,"04 23, 2011",2011,1249,"['had', 'joy', 'being', 'college', 'production', 'show', 'back', '1980', 'was', 'first', 'exposure', 'Brel', 'fell', 'love', 'spot', 'can', 'not', 'count', 'number', 'times', 'have', 'listened', 'original', 'cast', 'recording', 'recording', 'made', 'performance', 'Even', 'production', 'heard', 'how', 'bad', 'film', 'version', 'was', 'always', 'avoided', 'Finally', '30+', 'years', 'later', 'curioisity', 'got', 'best', 'watched', 'had', 'very', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'several', 'songs', 'stage', 'version', 'are', 'missing', 'others', 'are', 'inserted', 'likewise', 'sequence', 'songs', 'been', 'changed', 'Visually', 'film', 'belongs', 'avante-garde', 'style', 'time', 'forced', 'symbolism', 'surrealistic', 'transitions', 'odd', 'camera', 'angles', 'etc', 'Accept', 'what', 'what', 'film', 'watching', 'are', 'performances', 'Eli', 'Stone', 'Mort', 'Schumann', 'two', 'people', 'primarily', 'responsible', 'popularizing', 'Brel', 'US', 'added', 'treat', 'Brel', 'appearance', 'singing', 'Non', 'quitte', 'pas', 'film', 'version', 'show', 'would', 'make', 'were', 'director', 'No', 'serve', 'visual', 'record', 'original', 'performers', 'context', 'era', 'was', 'created']",Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris
