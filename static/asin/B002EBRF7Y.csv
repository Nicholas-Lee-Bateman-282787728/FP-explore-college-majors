The one star I gave is not because is the lowest rating available.  I actually gave 1 star because I think the idea of having an apocalyptical time where the antichrist is coming and that the earth is plagued with zombies as consequence is not really a bad plot.  With a big budget this could have been an Oscar winner.  But the vampires section was way too bad, too stupid or just too brainless.  The kids did not know what to do with the zombies outside or they couldn't do anything due to budget restrictions so they decided to focus all the stories inside the apartments were the survivors are hidden and they went like: ""lets put some Vampires too"" WTF...?@#$%$%^^&&**? The vampires were not really vampires but they had to ruin the movie by including this extra sub plot.

1265116,A3MDA891A1EPT8,B002EBRF7Y,"Chris Winchester ""mikeystoyz""","[3, 6]","After seeing what was spent on this movie I am pretty impressed with the final results.  There are three stories told in this zombie movie.  You have a guy and his wife living in an apartment with the guy always typing on his computer and basically ticking his wife off.  You have two vampires looking for their next meal and finally you have the a woman protecting a young man in the third setting.  The vampire story and the woman protecting the young man were the stronger of the two stories.This movie is worth a watch.  It was pretty short and the camera work could have been better but all in all I thought it was a good movie.  It would have been interesting to see what these guys could do with some real money. The special effects are pretty decent.  There are a bunch of zombies in this movie which is good.  Anyway check it out.  You wont be to disappointed if you dont go into this thinking it is going to be the greatest thing in the world.Side rant coming up.  If you can do better please do.  These movies are made with no budget so to speak and are made to the best of the film makers ability.  I have nothing to do with this film but can see the effort put into the thing.  While everyone has the right to rip apart whatever they want, you need something to back it up with other then I just wasted two hours of my life.  I can come up with big budget movies that I can say this to as well.

First of all I will admit that it's not for everyone; if you can't stand low budget, independent flix then you would best be advised to run the other way because this flick is the definition of low budget. If you don't want to see anything that attempts to stray from the beaten path then avoid this at all costs. If you confuse easily scratch it off your list. And lastly, if your zombie flix MUST consist of nothing but wall to wall zombie mayhem, well just forget it 'cause it ain't happening here. On the other hand if you can overlook the usual ""flaws"" that come with low budgets, if originality and creativity are your bag, if you don't mind occasional confusion and have no objections to a zombie movie where the zombies are more of a backdrop than the main feature, then EDGES OF DARKNESS may very well entertain you as much as it did me. It's not the best movie I've seen lately but it's a good attempt at blazing a new trail. And, NO, I had nothing to do with making the film and I don't know anyone connected with it either. I just appreciate different approaches to tired genres, and the zombie holocaust is fast becoming a cliche.Recommended to those who like low budget goodness.

Film starts off with boring introductions to rather boring characters and an obsessed cyber nerd narrating. Seems they all live in the same complex... or town... or something. Who cares. Heres a kicker.. Theres a black couple who appear to be vampires? Or just obsessed with drinking blood, im not sure and dont care anyway. They kidnap victims and feed on them for survival, and apparently must not have any powers or strength considering they are freaked out by zombies. The male vampire does seem to snap a zombies neck with two fingers in one scene though...? The next characters in this circus is the cyber nerd, whos obsessed with blogging?  His wife is going through a mental breakdown and its about as boring as it sounds. The nerd installs a processor into his pc which somehow turns his cactus into a snail and spawns one of the dumbest comments i've ever heard in a film. I'll just leave that at that. The next character is this whore who becomes rambo after the apocalypse takes her husband and baby. She saves a mother and son... the mother sends rambo chick on a suicide run for medicine, meanwhile the son kills his mother? Yeah im lost too. He then tells his whole story of how he needs a body to vessel so he can bring his father back into this world?  Which brings in two priests who are devil worshipers I... you know what ....

Yes, believe it, there wasn't one double-tap scene to be seen for the whole lobotomizing 88 minutes.  Given the subject of the three mini-stories, there was more than enough room for the writer to have inserted some kind of insight into human nature or about the world at large-usually imparted onto the unsuspecting view about 20 or 30 minutes into the story.  Instead we get some kinds of tales about:  marital relations, the drive to survive at any cost and . . . well, I'm not sure what the survival chick story was about, but---oh wait, something something something apocalypse . . . but no rousing affirmations of humanity, no nail-biting action, no just deserts for evil doers who do not-so wisely, only a grim determination on this reviewer's part to root for the zombies at any cost.  One wonders whether the audience was really able to keep a straight face when this story actually was a stage play.  Were there any good parts to this movie?

As blood splattered/horrific as the film is, it does hold your attention and boasts excellent production values.What stands out in ""Edge"" is the make up.  With seemingly hundreds of zombies (although I'm sure there are only around 20), the make up and oozy prosthetic limbs are well done.  Numerous scenes feature a zombie smorg, with arms, heads, and handfulls of fresh flesh (say that 20 times) dripping with blood.  Blood splats are not uncommon, and surprisingly, the death (can it be so) scenes are tasteful.The horror is well done, with a psychological tension that grows.  The writer who is possessed by his work while outside his walls, the zombies lurk reminds of Jack Nicholson in the Shining.  ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"".  I do not want that computer upgrade!  The priests searching for the anti-christ come straight out of the Omen, and the vampires, are non-typical yet they all come together in this anthology format. Horror, apocalypse, and vampirism.  Look for it all here!In terms of craft, these guys certainly studied the classics.  Creative use of color, angles, and isolationism make this a must watch.Will this lead to an ""Edge of Darkness II""?  I hope so.

1265133,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B002EBRF7Y,trashcanman,"[8, 13]","""Edges of Darkness"" is not one tale of the zombie apocalypse, but three.  And no, they don't all converge at the end.  It's a storytelling format that turns out to be shockingly effective as the focus switches between several groups of survivors struggling to cope with this brave new world of the undead.  It combines several different forms of social commentary (some of which is owed to Romero, some of which is not) and creates not just a story of a zombie invasion, it paints a picture of a world invaded by zombies.  I was extremely pleasantly surprised by this film considering the  low scores it has received.  This is a perfect example of creativity trumping a big budget.  I guess some people just can't get by without a shiny picture, lots of CG, and no celebrities in the cast.  Their loss is our gain.The cast of the movie is a diverse lot.  One crew includes a hardcase hottie who takes in a parent with a child who turns out to be much more then anybody will suspect.  Another is a married couple where the husband is so obsessed with his computer that the wife is forced to talk to and fantasize about the zombies peering into her bedroom window at night.  The last primary group is two vampires who capture a bleating, sobbing girl to feed upon and find that things are not as they seem.  Each story works as a self-contained narrative, but the way they are split apart and woven together is so seamless and natural that you never feel for  a minute that the story is fragmented.  The pacing is outstanding.  It is almost scary to think of what these guys could have done with a modest budget.So: the brutality.  Well, it's fairly sparse and spread out after the wonderfully gory opening sequence, but when it's there it does not play around.  A zombie father devouring his own child sound like fun?  Ever wonder just how many times a woman would continue to crush the skull of somebody who killed her husband even after they were long dead?  Hint: it's a LOT!  Even I was appalled at some of the violence in this movie.  And that is seldom a bad thing.  The ladies are a lovely lot, but I'm afraid there is no graphic sex or nudity.  Sorry boys.  Thankfully, this one thrives even without it.While this is a zombie film like no other, it does have a large Romero influence.  Surprisingly, most of that influence has nothing to do with the legendary horror director's zombie films. The vampires in ""Edges of Darkness"" are not the traditional supernatural creatures of the night, but take their cues from the lesser-known Romero workMartin.  Cred established.  The story of the lonely wife and the computer-obsessed husband is actually the most unbelievable.  It involves a supposedly experimental semi-biological computer processor that is obviously a metaphor for people allowing technology to drain the life out them, but it's a bit over-the-top, even in a movie with zombies and vampires.  Plus, who would ignore their hot wife in favor of writing fiction that nobody will ever read?  They could have at least had him surfing the internet or playing video games or something.  Then again, his computer appeared to be from the 80's.  The vampire couple's story is extremely strong in it's originality and suffers only due to the massive mystery the viewer is left with: who/what was that girl?  The most ambitious is the tale of the sexy zombie huntress who winds up being captured by a group of sadistic priests and winds up becoming the protector of the the world's last hope.  Or is it humanity's greatest enemy?  Warning : blurry grey lines surrounding religious beliefs.  This is a truly fantastic touch that elevated this film to much better then I expected even halfway in.Throw in a bit of black comedy and you've struck micro-budget gold.  The picture is subpar, but does not border on unwatchable as a lot of these kinds of independent film do. The acting is what you'd expect, but it gets the job done. I rather like the casting, and the directors (Blaine Cade and Jason Horton, who also shared writing duties) do so with a ton of style.  Somebody give these two a budget!  NOW!  This may not be the best zombie film ever made, but it is certainly one of the most unique.  Coming in at under 90 minutes, I was hungry for more.  If you are of the type who can appreciate creative low-budget horror, then have a look at this.  If you got this because you wanted to see Zombieland 2, you're barking up the wrong tree.
