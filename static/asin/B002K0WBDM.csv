I truthfully didn't remember much about it, and upon purchasing this DVD set and watching it again I can see why.I want to state emphatically that this isn't a terrible show by any stretch.  It has its charm and the animation is actually pretty good for its time. The problem is that the stories to each episode are very formulaic and simplistic.  There's no real hook to keep you interested UNLESS you're already a Superman fan and know the characters, and even then the characters come across as cardboard cutouts of their comic book and film counterparts.  The voice acting is just OK - nothing to really praise or criticize, which is/was pretty standard for the era.  The music stands out as pretty good, however.The Scrapbook segments at the end are fairly entertaining but suffer a bit from silliness.Overall I would say that, unless you're a collector or die-hard Superman fan, you can probably skip this show and not really miss out on anything.",3,For die-hard Superman fans only,1358553600,"01 19, 2013",2013,1023,"['watched', 'RUBY-SPEARS', 'SUPERMAN', 'animated', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'truthfully', 'did', ""n't"", 'remember', 'much', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'set', 'watching', 'again', 'can', 'see', 'why.I', 'want', 'state', 'emphatically', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'show', 'stretch', 'charm', 'animation', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'time', 'problem', 'stories', 'episode', 'are', 'very', 'formulaic', 'simplistic', 'real', 'hook', 'keep', 'interested', ""'re"", 'already', 'Superman', 'fan', 'know', 'characters', 'even', 'then', 'characters', 'come', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'counterparts', 'voice', 'acting', 'just', 'OK', 'nothing', 'really', 'praise', 'criticize', 'is/was', 'pretty', 'standard', 'era', 'music', 'out', 'pretty', 'good', 'however.The', 'Scrapbook', 'segments', 'end', 'are', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'suffer', 'bit', 'silliness.Overall', 'would', 'say', ""'re"", 'collector', 'die-hard', 'Superman', 'fan', 'can', 'probably', 'skip', 'show', 'not', 'really', 'miss', 'out', 'anything']",N/A

Leonard ""BlayneL""","[2, 2]","The Ruby/Spears' version of Superman is a Saturday morning animated series that aired on CBS in 1988 and was created by the same team responsible for bringing the hit cartoon ""Thundarr the Barbarian"" to TV.  Ruby/Spears' version of Superman was an animated reboot of the character, following a similar format used in the successful motion picture series.  It even used the re-orchestrated versions of John Williams' classic themes from the movies, which was really cool.  The stories were a little grittier with more action and seemed to be aimed at attracting older viewers that were fans of the Christopher Reeve movies.  It was a welcomed and refreshing change after years of only seeing Superman featured as a part of the Superfriends, which was created for a much younger audience. The animation also matured in comparsion to the Superfriends predecessor, adding more artistic detail to the characters and fluidity to the action.  Many of the episodes featured Superman facing off with his #1 arch-enemy, Lex Luthor; who was re-invented from being an evil scientist to a corrupt billionaire industrialist.  Other than Lex Luthor, the only other familiar character from the DC Universe that appeared in this series was Wonder Woman - who, for the first time in her animated history, was given the power of flight like Superman.  Although there weren't hardly any stories based on the Superman comic book timeline, Ruby/Spears' Superman managed to crank out entertaining sci-fi adventures, while still remaining faithful to his origins and the mythos that all of us are familiar with.

However, after only 13 episodes, CBS pulled the plug on this Saturday morning cartoon show! It was unceremoniously cancelled! Thanks to DVD, we have a second chance to see it again. Its sweet ""Superman spirit"" is there! Musician Ron Jones(Star Trek The Next Generation) borrows a few music cues from John Williams' music score for Superman The Movie(1978). This Superman cartoon tries to emulate the Christopher Reeve Superman movies. Superman IV: The Quest for Peace(1987) was the last time that Reeve played Superman. This show isn't perfect. The plots are paper thin and each episode only runs 20-25 minutes. The WB Superman cartoon had better scripts. Each episode has a short adventure(Superman Family Album) where we see Clark Kent as a child. Clark Kent's blonde, female babysitter was pure eye candy! The opening credits are adrenaline-pumping! We see Superman flying through space and 30 seconds of John Williams' Superman theme music plays on the soundtrack!

I didn't have any expectations for this show, I figured it would just be an entertining way to spend some time. In the end, it had a hard time doing even that. It had some good points, but more bad. I'll talk about the good points first.The actual animation was pretty good. There were some humorous spelling errors on background signs at times, and the perspective could fluxuate to ridiculous extremes in some action scenes, but overall the animation was decent. The voice acting ranged from good (Superman, Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, Lex Luthor) to mediocre (a lot of the generic aliens/villains) but most of the time it was atleast ok. The theme song was great, but since its the Christopher Reeve's movie theme, thats not surprising. Lex Luthor was a very interesting villain, and it was usually fun to see him in an episode. The series also had a cool episode with Wonder Woman.Now, on to the bad. This show didn't take advantage of Superman's villains at all. You get one Supoerman villain (LEx Luthor) and an appearance by a version of Shadow Theift (except this time its a whole group). Every other villain is a boring, sometimes annoying, and usually generic villain made up for the show. None of them are that interesting, and one or two seem to have absolutely no motivation or real plan/goals. Even the Superfriends cartoons, which I enjoy for their goofiness, usually had some kind of motivation for the bad guys, even if it was just ""We need to destroy the heroes"". There was one villain specifically in this show who basically did evil things for no real reason, and just left me confused about what he was trying to do. There also isn't much action. I'm assuming its mostly because its a product of its time, but Superman does a lot of saving, but very little actual fighting the bad guys. When he does fight them, they're usually some kind of monster, and its very brief. Since the lack of good villains is such a problem, you notice the lack of anything really happening, especially since most episodes don't have much of a story to support the lack of good villains/action.Overall, this series isn't horrible, and it has some good moments, but its not as much goofy fun as some of the Superfriends cartoons, nor as good a show as the later Superman: The Animated Series.

It is only 13 episodes long and the stories are not like todays they are more innocent which can be a good thing when the child is onlt 3 or 6 years of age.

As far as the animated versions go the 1940s originals by the Fleischer brothers is still the best, but this one is a close second. I recently purchased the version from the late '60s and was very disappointed. Then I got this one and was very pleasantly surprised. The twenty-minute format gives time for good story development. The concept bridges the gap between the old universe and the new one pioneered by John Byrne in 1986. This is best shown by the portrayal of Lex Luthor, a cross between Gene Hackman's version in the movies and the businessman of the new version. The bad news is that a lot of it is laughable, with Luthor's criminal activities being quite over-the top. On the other hand the portrayal of the main characters is pretty good, and the art is much less cartoony than the latest animated version, if the stories aren't as good.All in all it was worth the purchase, especially at the low price I paid at Amazon.",4,"Not the best, but very close.",1330992000,"03 6, 2012",2012,1050,"['grew', 'up', 'watching', 'George', 'Reeves', 'play', 'Superman', ""'50s"", 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'things', 'Superman', 'ever', 'As', 'far', 'animated', 'versions', 'go', '1940s', 'originals', 'Fleischer', 'brothers', 'still', 'best', 'one', 'close', 'second', 'recently', 'purchased', 'version', 'late', ""'60s"", 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'Then', 'got', 'one', 'was', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'twenty-minute', 'format', 'time', 'good', 'story', 'development', 'concept', 'gap', 'old', 'universe', 'new', 'one', 'pioneered', 'John', 'Byrne', '1986', 'best', 'shown', 'portrayal', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'cross', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'version', 'movies', 'businessman', 'new', 'version', 'bad', 'news', 'lot', 'laughable', 'Luthor', 'criminal', 'activities', 'being', 'quite', 'over-the', 'top', 'other', 'hand', 'portrayal', 'main', 'characters', 'pretty', 'good', 'art', 'much', 'less', 'cartoony', 'latest', 'animated', 'version', 'stories', 'are', ""n't"", 'good.All', 'was', 'worth', 'purchase', 'especially', 'low', 'price', 'paid', 'Amazon']",N/A

1273514,A2NXAV1SNXWA9H,B002K0WBDM,S. R.,"[84, 86]","Premiering on CBS in 1988 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Superman, this Joseph Ruby and Kenneth Spears (Ruby-Spears) produced cartoon series marked the first time that elements of theChristopher Reeve Supermanmovies and the post-CrisisSuperman were combined onscreen.  Veteran comic book writer Marv Wolfman acted as the lead story editor for the series and helped transform Lex Luthor from the mad scientist featured in theSuperfriendscartoons to the billionaire industrialist found in the 1986 John Byrne pennedMan of Steelrevamp.  Each episode consisted of a lead 18-minute Superman story, followed by a 4-minute flashback story that was part of the 'Superman's Family Album' segment, which chronicled Superman's life from his adoption by the Kents to his first appearance in costume.  With character designs by the legendary artist Gil Kane, this series featured some of the finest animation that Superman had seen in decades, despite having lasted for only one season.  The tone of the stories were also slightly more mature than what had been previously seen of Superman on the Saturday morning landscape, save for the underratedSuper Powers Team: Galactic Guardianscartoon series.  The title sequence for each episode started off with the music cue from the John WilliamsSuperman themeand quickly transitioned into the series' originaltheme musicby Ron Jones, accompanied by the familiar ""faster than a speeding bullet"" narration made famous by theFleischer Supermancartoons and the George ReevesAdventures of SupermanTV series.  Here are the episodes on this set;1. DESTROY THE DEFENDROIDS- Superman must stop Lex Luthor's super-police force, the Defendroids.THE ADOPTION- Baby Kal-El causes trouble at the adoption agency until the Kents finally decide to adopt him.2. FUGITIVE FROM SPACE- An alien cop is hunting an escaped fugitive and Superman is caught in the middle.THE SUPERMARKET- Little Clark makes a trip to the supermarket into an adventure for Ma Kent.3. BY THE SKIN OF THE DRAGON'S TEETH- Superman unwittingly aids Luthor find a treasure in China.AT THE BABYSITTER'S- The babysitter has her hands full with young Clark's super powered mischievous behavior.4. CYBRON STRIKES- Superman does battle with a seemingly unstoppable cyborg from the future.THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL- Clark tries to fit in at school while keeping his powers a secret.5. THE BIG SCOOP- Lex Luthor learns that Clark is really Superman via a futuristic machine.OVERNIGHT WITH THE SCOUTS- Clark's camping trip turns into a search for a legendary monster.6. TRIPLE PLAY- The Prankster forces Superman to play in a rigged game of baseball for the lives of his friends.THE CIRCUS- Clark no longer feels like an outsider when he accidentally joins a traveling circus.7. THE HUNTER- Superman battles Phantom Zone villains including Zod and a shapeshifter called the Hunter.LITTLE RUNAWAY- Clark runs away from home only to realize things were not that bad at home.8. SUPERMAN & WONDER WOMAN VS. THE SORCERESS OF TIME- Our heroes must stop a threat to Paradise Island.THE BIRTHDAY PARTY- Young Clark's birthday party is filled with surprises for Ma and Pa Kent.9. BONECHILL- Superman battles a sorcerer with a magic talisman that can create monsters.THE DRIVER'S LICENSE- Clark is nervous about passing his driving test with an instructor.10. THE BEAST BENEATH THESE STREETS- Lois is kidnapped by a scientist turned monster.FIRST DATE- Teenage Clark's first date with Lana Lang leads to several unforeseen problems.11. WILDSHARK- Superman confronts an overzealous villain deep in the Bermuda Triangle.TO PLAY OR NOT TO PLAY- Clark discovers that he cannot use his powers to play football.12. NIGHT OF THE LIVING SHADOWS- Luthor develops a suit that can turn the wearer into a shadow.GRADUATION- A series of catastrophes threatens to keep Clark from going to his highschool graduation.13. THE LAST TIME I SAW EARTH- An alien seizes a space shuttle with Lois and Jimmy onboard.IT'S SUPERMAN- Clark arrives in Metropolis and makes his first appearance as Superman.The sole bonus feature for this set is the 'Corruption of the Corrupt: The Rise of Lexcorp' featurette, which examines Luthor's transition into the head of a greedy, corporate conglomerate.  While the inclusion of series-specific extras would have been a welcome addition, most fans are probably just grateful to finally see the show on DVD.  This exceptionally well-crafted series served as the perfect bridge between the kid-friendly cartoons of the 80s and the animated series phenomena of the 90s.  Now, over two decades later, fans can once again enjoy these lesser-seen adventures in Superman's never ending battle!",5,Short-Lived Effort Soars Onto DVD!,1249344000,"08 4,
