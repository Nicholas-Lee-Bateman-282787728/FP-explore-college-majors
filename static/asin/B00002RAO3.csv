Yeoh is a great figher, and she's just as quick and nimble as Chan, but we are only treated to one real right scene by her? Not only that, but that fight scene is interrupted by her Co-stars less than stellar fight scenes? Is it because she's female? Heck, it got so bad at one point, that it looked like Yeoh was going to be beaten do death (literally) by a hired goon. Why 3 stars? Cause she beats the crap outta the goon in a spectacular manner and does some of her trademark poses afterwards.",3,Good movie done poorly,970358400,"10 1, 2000",2000,606,"['Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'reviews', 'account', 'was', 'potentially', 'good', 'movie', 'done', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'Yeoh', 'great', 'figher', 'just', 'quick', 'nimble', 'Chan', 'are', 'only', 'treated', 'one', 'real', 'right', 'scene', 'Not', 'only', 'fight', 'scene', 'interrupted', 'Co-stars', 'less', 'stellar', 'fight', 'scenes', 'female', 'Heck', 'got', 'so', 'bad', 'one', 'point', 'looked', 'Yeoh', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'beaten', 'do', 'death', 'literally', 'hired', 'goon', 'Why', '3', 'stars', 'Cause', 'crap', 'goon', 'spectacular', 'manner', 'trademark', 'afterwards']",N/A

What they didn't say is that this is the most boring hong kong flick ever.  Not one of them but the most boring and one of the stupidest.The movie actually starts out really good but when Rongguang Yu leaves michelle to herself, there is a ton of standing around.Oh yeah the iron monkey is in this, and not even he can save it.  i actually think that he could have saved it, but whoever directed this was obviously trying to get into michelle's pants.  So obviosly he didn't and he was maybe trying to ruin her career.I love michelle and could make it through this, but if you liked supercop 1 and are expecting to see something similiar, DO NOT WATCH THIS.Also jackie is in drag in this movie, his scene last for 2-3 minutes and it is one of the 3-4 bright spots in the movie.
