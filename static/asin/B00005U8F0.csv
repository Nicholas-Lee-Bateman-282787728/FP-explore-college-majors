683586,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B00005U8F0,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[0, 0]","Season 2 was quite enjoyable, especially with the introduction of the colorful character Mr. Thomas Watkins, with his ever quest for ""scope"".  He further entertains us with Sarah, another whimsical character.It is said that Watkins character John Alderton, and Sarah character, Pauline Collins were married in real life.The other focus is on Miss Lizzie, the daughter of James and Lady Marjorie, as she continually searches for love and marriage, or at least honest love bestowed up on her.  I thoroughly am entertained by actress Rachel Gurney (died 2001, age 81).  She was quite convincing as the wealthy Edwardian matriarch, in her refined speech and mannerism.  And, equally convincing and colorful character was Mrs. Roberts,  a nosy,  persnickety personal maid to Lady Marjorie.But, some of my favorite characters of course are the ""below the stairs"" servants.  It is always a joy to watch Mr. Hudson and Mrs. Bridges run the household.  This season, Rose with Miss Lizzie become involved in the suffragette movement.This marks the last season with Lady Marjorie.  But,  you can see the philandering antics and financial burdens of  Major  James, the son.Again, Season 1 and 2 were filled with characters, stories, mishaps, fun, frolic, rigidity, etc.  Enjoy.....Rizzo",5,"Mishaps, fun, frolic, rigidity, pain, laughter..... it's here again!",1384646400,"11 17, 2013",2013,1274,"['Season', '2', 'was', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'especially', 'introduction', 'colorful', 'character', 'Mr.', 'Thomas', 'Watkins', 'ever', 'quest', 'scope', 'further', 'Sarah', 'whimsical', 'character.It', 'said', 'Watkins', 'character', 'John', 'Alderton', 'Sarah', 'character', 'Pauline', 'Collins', 'were', 'married', 'real', 'life.The', 'other', 'focus', 'Miss', 'Lizzie', 'daughter', 'James', 'Lady', 'Marjorie', 'continually', 'love', 'marriage', 'least', 'honest', 'love', 'bestowed', 'up', 'thoroughly', 'am', 'entertained', 'actress', 'Rachel', 'Gurney', 'died', '2001', 'age', '81', 'was', 'quite', 'convincing', 'wealthy', 'Edwardian', 'matriarch', 'refined', 'speech', 'mannerism', 'equally', 'convincing', 'colorful', 'character', 'was', 'Mrs.', 'Roberts', 'nosy', 'persnickety', 'personal', 'maid', 'Lady', 'Marjorie.But', 'favorite', 'characters', 'course', 'are', 'stairs', 'servants', 'always', 'joy', 'watch', 'Mr.', 'Hudson', 'Mrs.', 'Bridges', 'run', 'household', 'season', 'Rose', 'Miss', 'Lizzie', 'become', 'involved', 'suffragette', 'movement.This', 'last', 'season', 'Lady', 'Marjorie', 'can', 'see', 'philandering', 'antics', 'financial', 'burdens', 'Major', 'James', 'son.Again', 'Season', '1', '2', 'were', 'filled', 'characters', 'stories', 'mishaps', 'fun', 'frolic', 'rigidity', 'etc', 'Enjoy', '..Rizzo']","Upstairs, Downstairs - The Complete Second Season"

683588,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,B00005U8F0,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[0, 0]","Because I was working full time, attending nursing school at one college and working on a master's degree in history in another, I had no time to view this series when it originally aired, but I heard so much about it at the time from friends who were committed viewers, that I've always felt that I'd missed something.  When I saw that it was now on DVD, I decided I'd see what all the fuss was about.  Because I didn't know if I'd like the series, I decided to start with the final season.  If it was going to bore me, it would certainly do so by the end of its run when most series have started to run out of ideas and the key actors have gotten tired of their roles.  I was very surprised.  I loved the commitment of the fine character actors to their presentations and the social significance of the individual stories.  Needless to say, I watched the entire five seasons.Season two has a lot going for it.  The characters, first introduced in season one, have matured and developed into real people with real pasts, presents and foreseeable futures.  They make human mistakes and deal with them in ways that are commensurate with their individual histories and their own financial, social and psychological resources.Particularly interesting were the contrasts between the responses to socially unfortunate pregnancies by the Upstairs Elizabeth and the Downstairs Sarah.  The contrast between the behaviors of the males in their lives to their situations was also illuminating.  James Bellamy seems without a will or direction of his own and waits for others to take care of the situation he has helped to create, while Thomas uses the situation to the advantage of both Sarah and himself creating a new life for the two of them.  In fact, I found both Sarah and Thomas very intriguing and complex characters.This season the wasted lives of the Bellamy children become much more apparent.  Having watched season five first, I can now see why their lives came out as they did in the end.  With a primary focus on public appearance and opinion  and on having a good time rather than on internal integrity, the two seem to lack any kind of map or compass for choosing a direction in life.  This is especially so for Elizabeth who seems to want to leave a social legacy of some kind to the future but doesn't want it to be too difficult or inconvenient.  The two young aristocrats are poised on the cusp of political, social, and technological change which they seem to sense is going to change everything, but they seem totally incapable of rising to the challenge.The automobile and electricity are in the process of changing how life is lived, while creating a new avenue for personal advancement and growth based on ability rather than social class.  In fact, these venues provide a forum for the expression of ability which is virtually closed to those of upper class standing by virtue of being in ""business"" or in ""working with the hands"" which is considered beneath them.  Meanwhile these same self-made men, whose social background is not establishment, have decided to enter politics using money as their entre into upper class society.  Even as they do so, the values and expectations of that society are being diluted, eroded and changed.  When Thomas and Sarah enter the living room of the Bellamys to present Lady Margaret with a birthday gift, not as servants but as successful private people, there is an awkward confrontation between the classes they represent, but the audience is also left with a sense that change is in the wind.  The Sarahs and Thomases will be the future.  The Bellamys will be history.  Even as they all grieve over the death of the Old King at the end of the evening, we know that more has died than a man.Meanwhile women are in a state of rebellion, demanding enfranchisement in order to leverage their demands in society; where their voices are not willingly heard, their turn to violence is ignored with difficulty.  Yet the nasty response of the male dominated political system, while predictable, is something with which upper class women like Elizabeth or middle class individuals like Rose are ill prepared to deal.  Like the miners in another episode of the series, they are dealt with harshly and their protests muted and subverted.Though the series is predominantly filmed on a sound stage, a la daytime soaps, the sets are fantastic and the costumes and illumination make the era come alive.  The reappearance of some of the lovely gowns and day dresses at different occasions makes the action seem ""real life.""  It's not just one whirlwind of new dresses daily.  Making the series more real also was the occasional inconvenience, such as the plaster dust that arose during the introduction of electricity to the house or the noise that disturbed the household while the workmen installed it.Probably my favorite episode of Season 2 was that of the two pairs of brothers.  The differences between the interactions between Mr. Bellamy and Dr. Bellamy as opposed to those between the elder and younger Mr. Hudsons were very illuminating and rather dear.  I felt it furthered immensely the understanding of these two central characters.A wonderful series.",5,A remarkable season of a remarkable series,1283385600,"09 2, 2010",2010,5206,"['was', 'working',

Amazon moved those reviews to the newer 21st century ""Upstairs Downstairs"" series 2 by mistake. Make sure you note the differences. Many other reviews posted at the time of this update are NOT for the 2012 Upstairs Downstairs release. The title difference between the 1970s & 2010-12 series was simply the removal of the comma; which does cause confusion.. . .. . .. . .. . .Stunning in costume & set detail. Shows life of the working class (Downstairs) as they serve the aristocratic (Upstairs) Bellamy family. Led by butler Hudson (Gordon Jackson) the classic Edwardian masterful plots in this funny and dramatic back time-travel for years 1904 to 1910. Series 1, also available, is 1903-1909.Series 2 has 13 episodes introducing cast, Bellamy house trials, scandal, love, and the delight of seeing the wonderfully differences between classes. Great plots in every episode. Always sub-plots, upstairs and downstairs. Some topics were quite daring in the 70s. This is huge Emmy earner drama that went on for 5 series. The 40th anniversary Edition, ""Upstairs Downstairs Series 1-5"", is now available and the economical way to buy the saga.Sir Richard Bellamy MP (David Langton) and Lady Marjorie (Rachel Gurney) with heir Lt James (Simon Williams) and Miss Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett-`A Bit of a Do') who need quite a crew downstairs to keep their house in order. Mrs. Bridges (Angela Brddeley) cooks up a storm, while maid Rose (Jean Marsh, co-creator) helps keep linens and affairs tidy. The pilot introduces new servant Sarah (Pauline Collins), who adds saucy spice to the house on both ends of the stairs. Footman Alfred (George Innes) who quotes Bible, Perce (Brian Osborne) is lady's-man coachman, times being yet horse and carriage. When the auto arrives so does John Alderton as chauffeur Thomas. They seem to become your family. The cast playing of Thomas and Sarah will in time marry in real-life.SUBTITLES!  ALL episodes have SUBTITLES. And a very sturdy, compact case for the 4 discs. Bonus of 52 min ""Making Of"". A Conversation between a writer and Lt James Bellamy is 23 min. All 13 episodes in color, unlike Series 1.After the airing of ""The Forsyte Saga"" (a must series also), Eileen Atkins and Jean Marsh dreamed up the ""Upstairs Downstairs"" concept. Jean stared as Rose in the 70s TV blockbuster, and now continues that role in the continuation of the story on Brit TV (Dec '10). 3 episodes advance the story now to 1936, with a new cast (excepting Marsh) and also now including Atkins as Maud, the same house, same music, same title. After ""Upstairs Downstairs"" the pair of actresses combined again in creating ""The House of Eliott"", another period saga, bloody good Brit drama.Upstairs Downstairs is as addicting as scones and tea. A MUST-SEE, but I really recommend looking at the 40th Anniversary Edition. Spend less, enjoy more, and that 68 50-min. episode set has 25 hrs of Bonus.

I was not sure what to expect with the original, but I had read glowing reviews of the show, and decided to give it a try (it didn't hurt that season one of this show was available free for download for Prime members, but alas, not the subsequent seasons).This show has an amazing cast, not to mention riveting plot lines. As a costume drama, it is pretty enough but due to the age of the show and the budget constraints back then, the production quality is not as great as contemporary period dramas such as seen on hit series Downton Abbey, the remake Upstairs, Downstairs and others. Some of the episodes in Season One are rendered in black and white instead of color due to a strike back then. This however did not spoil my enjoyment of the show.The series ran for five seasons from 1971 to 1975. The primary setting for the show is 165 Eaton Place, a roomy townhouse, and the time frame spans Edwardian England, the First World War up till 1930. The series explores the lives of the upper-class Bellamy's (upstairs) and their servants (downstairs), and some of the themes covered during this season is the difference between the upper and lower classes, societal changes, and the plight of the poor, among others.The Bellamy's are made up of Richard Bellamy, MP (portrayed by David Langton) and his wife, Lady Marjorie Bellamy (played by Rachel Gurney), the daughter of the Earl and Countess of Southwold, and the couple have two children, James (Simon Williams) who is serving in the military, and strong-willed Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett).Meanwhile, the servants downstairs comprise competent and firm butler Hudson (Gordon Jackson); cook Mrs. Bridges (Angela Baddeley); head house parlour maid Rose Buck (Jean Marsh, who returns in the remake and takes on the role of housekeeper); a footman, a kitchen maid, and many more.Each episode has an interesting plot hook that keeps the viewer interested and eager to learn what happens next. The second season was even better than the first and that's saying a lot! Bellamy daughter Elizabeth is married, but her marriage remains unconsummated. The sexual tension between husband, the poet Lawrence Kirbridge, and Elizabeth have some serious consequences that places the Bellamy family name in jeopardy. James, the philandering son and alcoholic gets more seriously involved with former housemaid Sarah Moffatt (Pauline Collins) and this too provides more heartbreak for all concerned.Steadfast through it all is head parlour maid Rose Buck (Jean Marsh) who helps Elizabeth set up her new household but who eventually finds her way back to the Bellamy's at 165 Eaton Place. A new staff joins the household - a cunning young man named Thomas Watkins (John Alderton, real life husband of Pauline Collins).There is much excitement this season, with clever plot twists that had me riveted to the screen! Even staid, dependable Hudson has a moment of weakness, giving in to vanity and pride, and suffering the consequences. This season sees infidelities, marital strife, blackmail, pregnancies and deliveries, and many more!Forget the insipid shows that pass off as entertainment these days - I'll have a cuppa and watch these over any day!",5,"Highly addictive British period drama - exploring loves, lives, class warfare and many more!",1330300800,"02 27, 2012",2012,3332,"['am', 'sorry', 'admit', 'have', 'only', 'recently', 'discovered', 'series', 'too', 'way', 'remake', 'available', 'streaming', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'original', 'had', 'read', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'show', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'season', 'one', 'show', 'was', 'available', 'free', 'download', 'Prime', 'members', 'alas', 'not', 'subsequent', 'seasons', '.This', 'show', 'amazing', 'cast', 'not', 'mention', 'riveting', 'plot', 'lines', 'costume', 'drama', 'pretty', 'enough', 'due', 'age', 'show', 'budget', 'constraints', 'back', 'then', 'production', 'quality', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'contemporary', 'period', 'dramas', 'such', 'seen', 'hit', 'series', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'remake', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', 'others', 'episodes', 'Season', 'One', 'are', 'rendered', 'black', 'white', 'instead', 'color', 'due', 'strike', 'back', 'then', 'however', 'did', 'not', 'spoil', 'enjoyment', 'show.The', 'series', 'ran', 'five', 'seasons', '1971', '1975', 'primary', 'setting', 'show', '165', 'Eaton', 'Place', 'roomy', 'townhouse', 'time', 'frame', 'spans', 'Edwardian', 'England', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'up', 'till', '1930', 'series', 'lives', 'upper-class', 'Bellamy', 'upstairs', 'servants', 'downstairs', 'themes', 'covered', 'season', 'difference', 'upper', 'lower', 'classes', 'societal', 'changes', 'plight', 'poor', 'others.The', 'Bellamy', 'are', 'made', 'Richard', 'Bellamy', 'MP', 'portrayed', 'David', 'Langton', 'wife', 'Lady', 'Marjorie', 'Bellamy', 'played', 'Rachel', 'Gurney', 'daughter', 'Earl', 'Countess', 'Southwold', 'couple', 'have', 'two', 'children', 'James', 'Simon', 'Williams', 'who', 'serving', 'military', 'strong-willed', 'Elizabeth', 'Nicola', 'Pagett', '.Meanwhile', 'servants', 'downstairs', 'comprise', 'competent', 'firm', 'butler', 'Hudson', 'Gordon', 'Jackson', 'cook', 'Mrs.', 'Bridges', 'Angela', 'Baddeley', 'head', 'house', 'parlour', 'maid', 'Rose', 'Buck', 'Jean', 'Marsh', 'who', 'remake', 'role', 'housekeeper', 'footman', 'kitchen', 'maid', 'many', 'more.Each', 'episode', 'interesting', 'plot', 'hook', 'viewer', 'interested', 'eager', 'learn', 'what', 'next', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'first', 'saying', 'lot', 'Bellamy', 'daughter', 'Elizabeth', 'married', 'marriage', 'unconsummated', 'sexual', 'tension', 'husband', 'poet', 'Lawrence', 'Kirbridge', 'Elizabeth', 'have', 'serious', 'consequences', 'Bellamy', 'family', 'name', 'jeopardy', 'James', 'philandering', 'son', 'alcoholic', 'more', 'seriously', 'involved', 'former', 'housemaid', 'Sarah', 'Moffatt', 'Pauline', 'Collins', 'too', 'more', 'heartbreak', 'concerned.Steadfast', 'head', 'parlour', 'maid', 'Rose', 'Buck', 'Jean', 'Marsh', 'who', 'Elizabeth', 'set', 'up', 'new', 'household', 'who', 'eventually', 'way', 'back', 'Bellamy', '165', 'Eaton', 'Place', 'new', 'staff', 'household', 'cunning', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Thomas', 'Watkins', 'John', 'Alderton', 'real', 'life', 'husband', 'Pauline', 'Collins', 'much', 'excitement', 'season', 'clever', 'plot', 'twists', 'had', 'riveted', 'screen', 'Even', 'staid', 'dependable', 'Hudson', 'moment', 'weakness', 'giving', 'vanity', 'pride', 'suffering', 'consequences', 'season', 'infidelities', 'marital', 'strife', 'blackmail', 'pregnancies', 'deliveries', 'many', 'more', 'Forget', 'insipid', 'pass', 'off', 'entertainment', 'days', ""'ll"", 'have', 'cuppa', 'watch', 'day']","Upstairs, Downstairs - The Complete Second Season"
