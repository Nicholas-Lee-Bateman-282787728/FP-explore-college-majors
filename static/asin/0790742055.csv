As the action unfolds, so the odd couple become attached to one another - so much so, in fact, that Wilder's passing at the end of the film is a major event in the learners' lives.While the plot is a familiar one, the film is redeemed by two strong central performances: Pesci clearly enjoys himself in the role of Wilder (with the catchphrase ""O boy, O boy, O boy!"" while Fraser offers a sympathetic interpretation of Monty.  The film contains an interesting cameo from Gore Vidal as an opinionated professor, so fond of his own self-image that he seldom listens to anyone else.  However Wilder reduces him to speechlessness with a mixture of verbal wit and homespun philosophy.

I sometimes write reviews in a kind of pseudo-professional mode--and sometimes do just the opposite.  But it's always interesting to me to see the disparity (and occasional congruity) between the views of the pros (for which nowadays you only have to consult ""rottentomatoes.com"")and us amateurs (as exemplified here).But when I am not playing critic, I sometimes recall playing actor, artist, singer or actor myself (done the amateur thing in all of those realms too) and become perhaps a little more appreciative of and grateful for the ""non-professional"" point of view.  Sometimes the non-professional audience ""gets"" the point of a work more readily and more completely than the more jaded critical corps.  I can't help but think of how the filmmakers and the cast members would appreciate some of the kinder comments posted below.  It's nice to know that your work touched somebody.Which is not to imply that WITH HONORS (the movie I am ostensibly reviewing here) is a particularly good film.  It really isn't.  The filmmakers have their hearts in the right place, but this story of an ambitious young grad student learning some valuable life lessons at the hands of street wise and plain old philosophically wise middle aged bum (Joe Pesci) is fairly predictable and not much to write home (or to write a thesis) about.Forgive the joke.  It is, of course, a college thesis written by college whiz Montgomery Kessler (Frazer) that serves as the keye plot device in this film.  Young Monty loses his sole copy of his academic masterpiece (has this genius never heard of FLOPPIES?) only to find that it about to become kindling for the proud,unbowed and self-avowed bum, Simon Wilder (Pesci), who generously offers NOT to burn the young scholar's work in exchange for a bit of help in the food, clothing and shelter department.  Montgomery is at first appalled.  But you can pretty much guess what's going to happen next.  The natural resentment and qualified disgust Monty feels toward Simon will soon enough give way to friendship and respect.  And this nose-to-the-grindstone academic noodge will soon learn about *LIFE* from this graduate of the School of Hard Knocks.Of course, almost no sooner does their friendship take root than it is discovered that Simon also has a fatal disease (asbestiosis, which has its roots in Simon's years in the Merchant Marine--so, you see, he is a victim of the system).  He will die--we will soon see--tragically rejected by his own family, but nonetheless embraced by his new-found family (Monty and his housemates).It's a variation on a theme older than the movies.  I note one reviewer defends the film by noting that there ARE some surprises.  There may be, but not enough to elevate the film into the ""true original"" category. But it's reasonably well acted, well photographed and competently directed (not really a bad beginning for first time dramatic director Alek Kesheshian--whose previous work included the Madonna doc TRUTH OR DARE).  And while I don't think it deserves kudos, every film finds its audience (well, not EVERY film, but a good many), and for younger viewers who haven't been brought up on a steady diet of hokum, it could even be a refreshing change of pace from their actual steady diet of special effects laden action films.Sometimes we older viewers tend to forget that our ""old hat"" may be new for SOMEBODY.  This is a film with heart, and that counts for something.  As fans of WITH HONORS get older--and perhaps a little more jaded themselves--they might even find that they understand and even begin to agree with the criticisms levied against this sort of film.  They will likely see that a film can be simultaneously heartwarming AND manipulative.  But they will probably still look back at it affectionately.  And they may re-watch it (perhaps furtively). At that point, they might start to consider it something of a guilty pleasure.  Actually, it's nothing to feel particularly guilty about.  It's an OK film with an OK message and some good acting.That too counts for something.",3,Get That Boy A Floppy Disk...,1143504000,"03 28, 2006",2006,4197,"['could', ""n't"", 'help', 'being', 'impressed', 'favorable', 'comments', 'citizen', 'reviewers', 'like', 'refer', 'have', 'posted', 'sometimes', 'write', 'reviews', 'kind', 'pseudo-professional', 'mode', 'sometimes', 'do', 'just', 'opposite', 'always', 'interesting', 'see', 'disparity', 'occasional', 'congruity', 'views', 'pros', 'only', 'have', 'consult', 'rottentomatoes.com', 'amateurs', 'exemplified', 'here', '.But', 'when', 'am', 'not', 'playing', 'critic', 'sometimes', 'recall', 'playing', 'actor', 'artist', 'singer', 'actor', 'done', 'amateur', 'thing', 'realms', 'too', 'become', 'perhaps', 'little', 'more', 'appreciative', 'grateful', 'non-professional', 'point', 'view', 'non-professional', 'audience', 'point', 'work', 'more', 'readily', 'more', 'completely', 'more', 'jaded', 'critical', 'corps', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'how', 'filmmakers', 'cast', 'members', 'would', 'appreciate', 'kinder', 'comments', 'posted', 'nice', 'know', 'work', 'touched', 'somebody.Which', 'not', 'imply', 'WITH', 'HONORS', 'movie', 'am', 'ostensibly', 'reviewing', 'here', 'particularly', 'good', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'filmmakers', 'have', 'hearts', 'right', 'place', 'story', 'ambitious', 'young', 'grad', 'student', 'learning', 'valuable', 'life', 'lessons', 'hands', 'street', 'wise', 'plain', 'old', 'philosophically', 'wise', 'middle', 'aged', 'bum', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'not', 'much', 'write', 'home', 'write', 'thesis', 'about.Forgive', 'joke', 'course', 'college', 'thesis', 'written', 'college', 'whiz', 'Montgomery', 'Kessler', 'Frazer', 'keye', 'plot', 'device', 'film', 'Young', 'Monty', 'sole', 'copy', 'academic', 'masterpiece', 'genius', 'never', 'heard', 'FLOPPIES', 'only', 'find', 'become', 'kindling', 'proud', 'unbowed', 'self-avowed', 'bum', 'Simon', 'Wilder', 'Pesci', 'who', 'generously', 'NOT', 'burn', 'young', 'scholar', 'work', 'exchange', 'bit', 'help', 'food', 'clothing', 'shelter', 'department', 'Montgomery', 'first', 'appalled', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'guess', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'natural', 'resentment', 'qualified', 'disgust', 'Monty', 'feels', 'Simon', 'will', 'soon', 'enough', 'give', 'way', 'friendship', 'respect', 'nose-to-the-grindstone', 'academic', 'noodge', 'will', 'soon', 'learn', '*LIFE*', 'graduate', 'School', 'Hard', 'Knocks.Of', 'course', 'almost', 'sooner', 'friendship', 'take', 'root', 'discovered', 'Simon', 'also', 'fatal', 'disease', 'asbestiosis', 'roots', 'Simon', 'years', 'Merchant', 'Marine', 'so', 'see', 'victim', 'system', 'will', 'die', 'will', 'soon', 'see', 'tragically', 'rejected', 'own', 'family', 'nonetheless', 'embraced', 'new-found', 'family', 'Monty', 'housemates', '.It', 'variation', 'theme', 'older', 'movies', 'note', 'one', 'reviewer', 'film', 'noting', 'ARE', 'surprises', 'may', 'be', 'not', 'enough', 'elevate', 'film', 'true', 'original', 'category', 'reasonably', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'photographed', 'competently', 'directed', 'not', 'really', 'bad', 'beginning', 'first', 'time', 'dramatic', 'director', 'Alek', 'Kesheshian', 'previous', 'work', 'included', 'Madonna', 'TRUTH', 'OR', 'DARE', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'kudos', 'film', 'audience', 'well', 'not', 'EVERY', 'film', 'good', 'many', 'younger', 'viewers', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'brought', 'up', 'steady', 'diet', 'hokum', 'could', 'even', 'be', 'refreshing', 'change', 'pace', 'actual', 'steady', 'diet', 'special', 'effects', 'laden', 'action', 'older', 'viewers', 'tend', 'forget', 'old', 'hat', 'may', 'be', 'new', 'SOMEBODY', 'film', 'heart', 'counts', 'something', 'fans', 'WITH', 'HONORS', 'get', 'older', 'perhaps', 'little', 'more', 'jaded', 'might', 'even', 'find', 'understand', 'even', 'begin', 'agree', 'criticisms', 'levied', 'sort', 'film', 'will', 'likely', 'see', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'simultaneously', 'heartwarming', 'AND', 'manipulative', 'will', 'probably', 'still', 'look', 'back', 'affectionately', 'may', 're-watch', 'perhaps', 'furtively', 'point', 'might', 'start', 'consider', 'something', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'Actually', 'nothing', 'feel', 'particularly', 'guilty', 'OK', 'film', 'OK', 'message', 'good', 'acting.That', 'too', 'counts', 'something']",N/A

109856,A2SZQ4ZI72XZJU,0790742055,lawliss,"[2, 2]","This movie is a comedy/drama that was released in 1994 (you can tell by the hair styles!!) and was directed by Alek Keshishian. I don't think that Mr. Keshishian had directed any movies prior to this - he was most known for directing music videos for singers like Madonna. It stars Brendan Fraser (as Montgomery ""Monty"" Kessler), Joe Pesci (as Simon Wilder), Moira Kelly (as Courtney Blumenthal), Patrick Dempsey (yes, McDreamy, as Everett Calloway) and Josh Hamilton (as Jeffrey Hawkes).Monty, Courtney, Everett and Jeffrey are seniors and roomates at Harvard University.  Monty is dead set on graduating with honors in his chosen major - political science. He has opted to write his senior thesis on economics.  The thesis is decidedly conservative and espouses and subscribes to the theories put forward by Ronald Reagan during his tenure as president. One night, after returning from a long day of classes and research, Monty goes to work on his thesis but all of his data and the thesis on his hard drive are lost when power in the house is lost. Understandably, Monty freaks out because his hard drive is fried but luckily, he has a number of chapters printed out as back up, so he opts to go down to the library to make copies that evening, instead of waiting for the morning, as his much cooler headed roomates advised.  On his way, he breaks his ankle and loses the remaining hard copy down a steam shaft. When he finally gets into the library and finds his hard copy, it is in the possession of Simon Wilder, a homeless man that lives in the boiler room of Harvard's Widener library in spite of being a former Merchant Marines. Simon also has a lot of health problems, including asbestos inhalation that was never identified and treated.  This movie details the impact that Simon, Simon's experience and his knowledge has on the four roomates, and, most notably, on Monty, whose entire worldview changes as a result of this interaction.I enjoyed this movie, not because it really packed a punch or was a movie with a message (a la Hurt Locker) that was being forced down my throat but because it was a pleasant, easy to watch movie.  It's one of those movies that you can watch that is comforting in the sense that it doesn't really push the viewer but is really high in entertainment value.  I enjoyed watching the actors and, quite frankly, I enjoyed the nostalgia of seeing Harvard, Cambridge and the Charles River in some scenes because those days were a little easier for me. And I loved Cambridge very much. Still do. The cast was wonderful, even though the movie itself could get a little saccharine and cheesy and the plot a little predictable. I also really appreciated that this was a college movie - a movie about college students - where the students seemed to try to figure themselves out as people - to increase their depth and figure out their roles in the world, instead of just trying to figure out how to get beer, more money, more pot or how to get to White Castle. They tried to navigate the moral battles that they were given and to learn from them, and I appreciated that this happened in this movie, whereas in other movies, that doesn't always happen. I really enjoyed it in general, even though it wasn't a critically acclaimed movie.This is one you should add to your collection.",3,Comfortable movie to watch,1273190400,"05 7, 2010",2010,3315,"['movie', 'comedy/drama', 'was', 'released', '1994', 'can', 'tell', 'hair', 'was', 'directed', 'Alek', 'Keshishian', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Mr.', 'Keshishian', 'had', 'directed', 'movies', 'prior', 'was', 'most', 'known', 'directing', 'music', 'videos', 'singers', 'Madonna', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'Montgomery', 'Monty', 'Kessler', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'Simon', 'Wilder', 'Moira', 'Kelly', 'Courtney', 'Blumenthal', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'yes', 'McDreamy', 'Everett', 'Calloway', 'Josh', 'Hamilton', 'Jeffrey', 'Hawkes', '.Monty', 'Courtney', 'Everett', 'Jeffrey', 'are', 'seniors', 'roomates', 'Harvard', 'University', 'Monty', 'dead', 'set', 'graduating', 'honors', 'chosen', 'major', 'political', 'science', 'opted', 'write', 'senior', 'thesis', 'economics', 'thesis', 'decidedly', 'conservative', 'espouses', 'subscribes', 'theories', 'put', 'forward', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'tenure', 'president', 'One', 'night', 'returning', 'long', 'day', 'classes', 'research', 'Monty', 'work', 'thesis', 'data', 'thesis', 'hard', 'drive', 'are', 'lost', 'when', 'power', 'house', 'lost', 'Understandably', 'Monty', 'out', 'hard', 'drive', 'fried', 'luckily', 'number', 'chapters', 'printed', 'out', 'back', 'go', 'down', 'library', 'make', 'copies', 'evening', 'instead', 'waiting', 'morning', 'much', 'cooler', 'headed', 'roomates', 'advised', 'way', 'ankle', 'remaining', 'hard', 'copy', 'down', 'steam', 'shaft', 'When', 'finally', 'library', 'hard', 'copy', 'possession', 'Simon', 'Wilder', 'homeless', 'man', 'boiler', 'room', 'Harvard', 'Widener', 'library', 'spite', 'being', 'former', 'Merchant', 'Marines', 'Simon', 'also', 'lot', 'health', 'problems', 'including', 'asbestos', 'inhalation', 'was', 'never', 'identified', 'treated', 'movie', 'details', 'impact', 'Simon', 'Simon', 'experience', 'knowledge', 'four', 'roomates', 'most', 'notably', 'Monty', 'entire', 'worldview', 'changes', 'result', 'interaction.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'not', 'really', 'packed', 'punch', 'was', 'movie', 'message', 'la', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'was', 'being', 'forced', 'throat', 'was', 'pleasant', 'easy', 'watch', 'movie', 'one', 'movies', 'can', 'watch', 'comforting', 'sense', ""n't"", 'really', 'push', 'viewer', 'really', 'high', 'entertainment', 'value', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'actors', 'quite', 'frankly', 'enjoyed', 'nostalgia', 'seeing', 'Harvard', 'Cambridge', 'Charles', 'River', 'scenes', 'days', 'were', 'little', 'easier', 'loved', 'Cambridge', 'very', 'much', 'Still', 'do', 'cast', 'was', 'wonderful', 'even', 'movie', 'could', 'get', 'little', 'saccharine', 'cheesy', 'plot', 'little', 'predictable', 'also', 'really', 'appreciated', 'was', 'college', 'movie', 'movie', 'college', 'students', 'where', 'students', 'seemed', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'people', 'increase', 'depth', 'figure', 'out', 'roles', 'world', 'instead', 'just', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'get', 'beer', 'more', 'money', 'more', 'pot', 'how', 'get', 'White', 'Castle', 'tried', 'navigate', 'moral', 'battles', 'were', 'given', 'learn', 'appreciated', 'happened', 'movie', 'whereas', 'other', 'movies', ""n't"", 'always', 'happen', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'general', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'movie.This', 'one', 'should', 'add', 'collection']",N/A

Director Alex Keshishian and screenwriter William Mastrosimone, however, don't knock you over the head with its theme and/or morals.  There are some scenes where you're expecting the probable to happen and they don't:  e.g., after Simon cooks Gorky, the rooster, you expect his master to be furious---when Simon finally meets up with the son he abandoned, you expect some kind of tearful reunion----and you certainly think Monty is going to graduate with honors.  The end results of these scenes, however, avoid the usual cliche.  Joe Pesci is delightfully understated in his role, and although he never really becomes coochy coo loveable, you understand his pains and shortcomings; Brendan Fraser starts out pretty snooty and insufferable but as he matures in his relationship with both Pesci and Moira Kelly (who is delightful as Courtney), Fraser becomes a more sympathetic character; Patrick Dempsey adds some lightweight humor as Gorky's master, and Josh Hamilton eschews the usual pain in the butt role with a believable and touching change of heart.The movie is definitely manipulative, but its heart is in the right place and its cast takes it seriously, so it ends up being a charming little film with a strong reaffirmation of the human spirit.",4,PESCI'S PHILOSOPHY,1111881600,"03 27, 2005",2005,1415,"['WITH', 'HONORS', 'thoughtful', 'well', 'done', 'little', 'slice', 'life', 'moral', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'do', 'what', 'happy', 'take', 'time', 'live', 'life', 'Director', 'Alex', 'Keshishian', 'screenwriter', 'William', 'Mastrosimone', 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'knock', 'head', 'theme', 'and/or', 'morals', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'probable', 'happen', 'do', ""n't"", 'e.g.', 'Simon', 'cooks', 'Gorky', 'rooster', 'expect', 'master', 'be', 'furious', '-when', 'Simon', 'finally', 'up', 'son', 'abandoned', 'expect', 'kind', 'tearful', 'reunion', 'certainly', 'think', 'Monty', 'going', 'graduate', 'honors', 'end', 'results', 'scenes', 'however', 'avoid', 'usual', 'cliche', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'delightfully', 'understated', 'role', 'never', 'really', 'coochy', 'coo', 'loveable', 'understand', 'pains', 'shortcomings', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'out', 'pretty', 'snooty', 'insufferable', 'relationship', 'Pesci', 'Moira', 'Kelly', 'who', 'delightful', 'Courtney', 'Fraser', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'lightweight', 'humor', 'Gorky', 'master', 'Josh', 'Hamilton', 'usual', 'pain', 'butt', 'role', 'believable', 'touching', 'change', 'heart.The', 'movie', 'definitely', 'manipulative', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'cast', 'seriously', 'up', 'being', 'charming', 'little', 'film', 'strong', 'reaffirmation', 'human', 'spirit']",N/A

Regrettably the man could not enlighten my professors, but he did leave a funny smell in the room after he had asked them all for spare change. This was not one of those ""noble homeless"" that Pesci portrays here so unconvincingly. It was one of the mentally challenged people whose very existence, is filled with desperation and indignity. And the worst part was that he bit Doc Ahern, took a whole chunk of his ear out.I only hope this movie does not damage all the progress that the homeless have made in this country.
