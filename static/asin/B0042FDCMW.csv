1383074,A3GU5PNTT7DRIY,B0042FDCMW,C.R. Hurst,"[3, 3]","Recently I have been suffering from repetitive stress injuries, in addition to the onset of osteoarthritis. So I began looking online for DVDs that provide not only variety in exercise, but also a low impact workout. No other exercise videos that I have found fit the bill better than Jane Fonda's trio of Prime Time DVDs: Firm & Burn, Fit & Strong, and Trim, Tone, & Flex. Together these workouts create a comprehensive and safe regime for the 50+ (or even younger) crowd looking to improve their stamina, flexibility, and strength.The first of the three DVDs, Firm & Burn, includes three 10 minute dance aerobic routines, as well as a warm-up and cool down. The dance steps for each routine are inspired by Doo-Wop, Latin, and Old School Funk beats and are easy enough for even the most uncoordinated (like me!) to follow with a little encouragement from Jane Fonda--and they provide a moderate cardio challenge. Also included on this tape is an 18 minute meditation segment led by Fonda that I find more effective than most meditations I have tried. Her calm voice is especially soothing here.The second DVD, Fit & Strong, contains two 25 minute workouts. Level 1 is an easy workout that stresses flexibility and isometrics, but also includes some light weight training. Level 2 is a more advanced workout that also features a mix of flexibility and strength moves. Either three pound (for beginners) or five pound (for advanced) weights are suggested. Throughout this tape (and the others as well) Fonda continually urges you to ""pull in your stomach"", ""pull up tall"", ""inhale"", and ""exhale"". These reminders may seem silly, but I find them helpful as I am prone to poor posture and holding my breath when I exert.The third DVD, Trim, Tone, & Flex, offers more flexibility and strength training like Fit & Strong, but I find it more challenging in that it emphasizes more weight training and is organized into two 20 minute sessions, one for upper body and another for lower body. What I like especially about these routines is that they include only five minutes of floor exercises (I don't know about you, but my crawling on the floor days are long gone!). I just fast forward through those, but even so, the remainder of the exercises leave me a little, but not too, sore the next morning. In addition, a 10 minute segment designed to help you relax before bed is also included.All in all, I find that these three Jane Fonda Prime Time DVDs offer considerable variety and challenge, in addition to being comprehensive enough for total fitness. After little more than a week exercising to these tapes--alternating them to my mood or need--I am already stronger with better range of motion. I wholeheartedly recommend them for any older woman (or man) who wants to improve their strength, flexibility, and aerobic fitness in a safe and effective way. Lucky for us not all fitness tapes are designed for the young. Thank you, Jane Fonda.",5,Wholeheartedly Recommended,1384819200,"11 19, 2013",2013,2941,"['Recently', 'have', 'been', 'suffering', 'repetitive', 'stress', 'injuries', 'addition', 'onset', 'osteoarthritis', 'began', 'looking', 'online', 'DVDs', 'provide', 'not', 'only', 'variety', 'exercise', 'also', 'low', 'impact', 'workout', 'other', 'exercise', 'have', 'found', 'fit', 'bill', 'better', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'trio', 'Prime', 'Time', 'DVDs', 'Firm', 'Burn', 'Fit', 'Strong', 'Trim', 'Tone', 'Flex', 'Together', 'workouts', 'create', 'comprehensive', 'safe', 'regime', '50+', 'even', 'younger', 'crowd', 'looking', 'improve', 'stamina', 'flexibility', 'strength.The', 'first', 'three', 'DVDs', 'Firm', 'Burn', 'three', '10', 'minute', 'dance', 'aerobic', 'routines', 'as', 'well', 'warm-up', 'cool', 'down', 'dance', 'steps', 'routine', 'are', 'inspired', 'Doo-Wop', 'Latin', 'Old', 'School', 'Funk', 'beats', 'are', 'easy', 'enough', 'even', 'most', 'uncoordinated', 'follow', 'little', 'encouragement', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'provide', 'moderate', 'cardio', 'challenge', 'Also', 'included', 'tape', '18', 'minute', 'meditation', 'segment', 'led', 'Fonda', 'find', 'more', 'effective', 'most', 'meditations', 'have', 'tried', 'calm', 'voice', 'especially', 'soothing', 'here.The', 'second', 'DVD', 'Fit', 'Strong', 'two', '25', 'minute', 'workouts', 'Level', '1', 'easy', 'workout', 'flexibility', 'isometrics', 'also', 'light', 'weight', 'training', 'Level', '2', 'more', 'advanced', 'workout', 'also', 'mix', 'flexibility', 'strength', 'moves', 'three', 'pound', 'beginners', 'five', 'pound', 'advanced', 'weights', 'are', 'suggested', 'tape', 'others', 'well', 'Fonda', 'continually', 'pull', 'stomach', 'pull', 'up', 'tall', 'inhale', 'exhale', 'reminders', 'may', 'seem', 'silly', 'find', 'helpful', 'am', 'prone', 'poor', 'posture', 'holding', 'breath', 'when', 'exert.The', 'third', 'DVD', 'Trim', 'Tone', 'Flex', 'more', 'flexibility', 'strength', 'training', 'Fit', 'Strong', 'find', 'more', 'challenging', 'more', 'weight', 'training', 'organized', 'two', '20', 'minute', 'sessions', 'one', 'upper', 'body', 'lower', 'body', 'What', 'like', 'especially', 'routines', 'include', 'only', 'five', 'minutes', 'floor', 'exercises', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'crawling', 'floor', 'days', 'are', 'long', 'gone', 'just', 'fast', 'forward', 'even', 'so', 'remainder', 'exercises', 'leave', 'little', 'not', 'too', 'sore', 'next', 'morning', 'addition', '10', 'minute', 'segment', 'designed', 'help', 'relax', 'bed', 'also', 'included.All', 'find', 'three', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'Prime', 'Time', 'DVDs', 'offer', 'considerable', 'variety', 'challenge', 'addition', 'being', 'comprehensive', 'enough', 'total', 'fitness', 'little', 'more', 'week', 'exercising', 'tapes', 'alternating', 'mood', 'need', 'am', 'already', 'stronger', 'better', 'range', 'motion', 'wholeheartedly', 'recommend', 'older', 'woman', 'man', 'who', 'improve', 'strength', 'flexibility', 'aerobic', 'fitness', 'safe', 'effective', 'way', 'Lucky', 'not', 'fitness', 'tapes', 'are', 'designed', 'young', 'Thank', 'Jane', 'Fonda']",N/A

I was pleasantly surprised and very impressed with the selection of exercises and focus of the workout, stretching and balance programs presented in this DVD. Jane Fonda's film and acting experience provides a friendly and inviting routine to follow along with. The evidence based focus of exercises provides a valuable benefit to all people, but especially older adults. It is easy to follow and thorough. The statistics she uses to drive home the importance of doing this exercise on a regular basis are accurate and should be heeded by us all!I would seriously like to thank Jane Fonda for putting together such a quality video that will make a positive impact in the lives of all seniors who decide to take advantage of it.As an RN with training in fall prevention and safety, I whole-heartedly recommend it!!!I am adding to this review something that you may find helpful to know. Unfortunately this DVD does NOT have chapter points at the start of each exercise. When you're just learning the routine, this is a real disadvantage. What I did was took pictures of the TV screen of each exercise and printed them out on paper in the order done in the work-out(~9 per page)and taped them on the wall under my TV. It's helping a lot because I can glance ahead and see what's next so I can quickly get ready for the next exercise. I would share the pictures here with my review if I could - just so it would be easy for you to do the same, but alas - not possible.I am bringing down my review from 5 to 4 stars because it would have been so easy for them to include chapter points. Why they didn't is beyond me, especially since it's aimed at older adults who may be a little slow to learn a new routine.

What an inspiration she is, born in 1937, yes, do the math...if she can do this so can you if you are fairly healthy.  I am in my 50's and walk and lift weights so I bought this as a different work out for days I am not so motivated to go to the gym.  Both workouts are about 20 minutes.  The first is a true beginner's workout.  Jane suggests weights but not how heavy.  I tried 4 pound weights, was not challenged, but for beginner, even 1 pound or no weight may be enough.  This is a true total body workout.  You will work out the arms and legs, followed by gentle stretching.  You will need the weights, a chair and a towel and a small space in front of the tv. You will not do floor exercises. Balance challenge is also included and Jane uses the chair for support.  You will not sweat with either of these workouts, no aerobics.  It is just Jane alone, with no demonstrations of slightly harder or easier versions.  The second workout uses the same equipment, but there is less use of chair support and exercises are more challenging.  I would still rate this as beginner, maybe for someone already walking and stretching a bit.  If you think these exercises are too easy, well, bump up those weights.  No one will stop you.  I could do these workouts back to back for a gentle day off, but for someone starting, the first 20 minutes could be okay.  Jane is calm, talks about proper form, and the pace is slow enough.  Only quibble is that she does not really count out how many reps one is doing.  Scenery is indoors in a staged living room, pleasant enough.

She started producing exercise videos since the early 80s and she is now in her early 70s and is still at it. Obviously from her appearance (lean and very trim) in this DVD, her exercise programs work.This DVD targets the mature crowd, and is well paced for persons within their 60s and 70s (as well as persons who may be recovering from an accident). Her instructions are given with the care and attention that elders deserve. Her calm voice encourages the viewer along throughout all of the paces. You get the feeling that she is really concerned about your well-being.This workout has been thoughtfully broken down into 2 levels, each about 25 minutes long so as not to over stress the body.

1383087,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B0042FDCMW,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[3, 3]","Works great for a 63-yr-old recovering from heart attack #2 and back surgery. Honest! With medical issues and senior age status, this DVD workout for strength and balance is one of the best yet. Attempting to continue suggested health exercise learned in rehab, this falls in line with what the professionals suggested.The first of 2 25-minute levels is noticeably lighter, perfect on those days when the body is not quite up to more, yet enough that I get the needed exercise to remain flexible and keep muscles as strong as my age allows. Of course Jane Fonda's muscles are in much better shape than mine, but she makes this feel real because she too emits an occasional groan through her constant talk about what each movement is doing and where it is helping. That makes the time go so quickly. After using the routine a number of time, one can just watch and keep with the movements while listening to the fantastic music background. My wife and I own many exercise DVD (senior levels by Leslie Sansone another favorite) but the Fonda DVDs have the best music of all.Fonda emphasizes balance in this DVD. That's a good thing for those of us aging. It's remarkable how many people our age fall and receive injury. This DVD is adaptable to any person regardless of condition. Even a handicapped person could use at least part of each routine. Not all require standing, weights can be adjusted to ability, and level + repetition is also an adaptable factor.The second routine or ""Level 2"" as it is called seems about the same type of exercise but on a bit stronger level of intensity. Again, it is as senior friendly as all of the fitness DVDs we have used. Both allowed me to do a workout that brought on light perspiration without pain, like rehab visits. And this is the first DVD used that has a presenter older than me. That alone gives great comfort that exercise toward health can continue for years.I'm lucky, I have an exercise-savvy wife. We do it together--for health's sake! Often during the exercise routine we're dreaming up another delicious heart-healthy recipe to try--together.

Taylor ""animal lover""","[6, 6]","I have to say that I was reluctant to buy this - every single exercise DVD or TV program I've tried to this point has been WAY too difficult for me, up to now. I have a rare neuromuscular disease that affects muscle movement in negative ways and also provides enough chronic fatigue to make me feel quite old before my time. But if I am going to have any quality of life whatsoever, I still need to exercise what remains to me.So I was ecstatic to discover that I could actually do most of the exercises on this video, granted only at the first level, but at least I could mostly do everything.I really liked the ""at home"" atmosphere of the DVD, and the easy-going attitude Jane Fonda has as she describes how to do these things. She has trouble with some of the exercises (or at least so she believably says) so I didn't feel dumb for the difficulties I was having. She made a few remarks about her artificial knee and hip, and it really did appear that at one point she had difficulties with balance. Since mine is a disease of coordination, because of her accepting attitude, I didn't feel so bad flunking the balance stuff. Maybe I'll get better, with time.That said, I can easily recommend this DVD to people with neuromuscular diseases and probably chronic illness. If you cannot do it all, you will still get more movement that your physical therapist will give you. In fact, I recognized most of these exercises as physical therapy routines. But these exercises are so much more pleasant in this setting and they have the potential, if you can keep up the speed, to go way beyond PT, which, for me, was never even vaguely aerobic. I can't keep up yet, but I think that will improve.

Watch out for the new and uncomfortable neck exercise she does at the end of both ""workouts,"" because you can hurt yourself as I did. I've gone back to her neck rolls from the 80s videos, which were great.Her face is young, but she acts old.

One of the main common threads running through each of SR's extraordinary chapter/story, I noticed especially, was the importance of exercise and fitness as a prerequisite to great lovemaking. Needless to say, that got my attention.Which leads me to number two: I discovered several great exercise DVDs and books specifically for seniors, including Jane Fonda's Prime Time - Fit & Strong.More than ever, I've become such a cheerleader for seniors to (1) get back in the romance game and (2) focus on fitness.Thanks, Jane Fonda, for the great work you are doing for seniors like me!",5,Benefits of Senior Fitness and Strength,1312243200,"08 2, 2011",2011,854,"['Two', 'great', 'things', 'happened', 'past', 'year.First', 'discovered', 'books', 'Seasoned', 'Romance', 'Dr.', 'Ruth', 'Sex', '50', 'Grandpa', 'Does', 'Grandma', 'helped', 'realize', 'larger', 'extent', 'ever', 'seniors', 'could', 'still', 'be', 'excited', 'sex', 'romance', 'One', 'main', 'common', 'threads', 'running', 'SR', 'extraordinary', 'chapter/story', 'noticed', 'especially', 'was', 'importance', 'exercise', 'fitness', 'prerequisite', 'great', 'lovemaking', 'Needless', 'say', 'got', 'attention.Which', 'number', 'two', 'discovered', 'several', 'great', 'exercise', 'DVDs', 'books', 'specifically', 'seniors', 'including', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'Prime', 'Time', 'Fit', 'Strong.More', 'ever', ""'ve"", 'become', 'cheerleader', 'seniors', '1', 'get', 'back', 'romance', 'game', '2', 'focus', 'fitness.Thanks', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'great', 'work', 'are', 'doing', 'seniors']",N/A
