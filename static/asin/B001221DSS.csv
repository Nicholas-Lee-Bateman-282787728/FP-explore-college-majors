Cipriani,"[1, 1]","This film delivers a relevant, timely, poignant and all-too-necessary message, but does so through an at-best mediocre delivery.To be fair, the failure of this DVD lies not with any acting ability as the actors' performances were superb.  Rather, the director and his technical team -- even for an obvious low-budget film -- failed miserably in producing a coherent, well-connected storyline lacking in substandard scene development and photography.Though the torture scenes are vivid and realistic, the plot loses coherence at many points throughout the firm and and filming seems strained to continue the film in a logical and relevant progression of events.  Obviously the sound crew and / or the director were not cognizant of the fact that in several instances lines were not delivered in either a coherent or understandable fashion.  There were more than several instances when spoken audio was totally unintelligible and one would have needed to resort to subtitles to know what was being said.Of course, this DVD also has no subtitles or captions for the hearing impaired.A higher quality production touching on the same theme would be the film ""Rendition"".",2,Poor Delivery of a Good Message,1286323200,"10 6, 2010",2010,1165,"['film', 'relevant', 'timely', 'poignant', 'all-too-necessary', 'message', 'so', 'at-best', 'mediocre', 'delivery.To', 'be', 'fair', 'failure', 'DVD', 'not', 'acting', 'ability', 'actors', 'performances', 'were', 'superb', 'Rather', 'director', 'technical', 'team', 'even', 'obvious', 'low-budget', 'film', 'failed', 'miserably', 'producing', 'coherent', 'well-connected', 'storyline', 'lacking', 'substandard', 'scene', 'development', 'torture', 'scenes', 'are', 'vivid', 'realistic', 'plot', 'coherence', 'many', 'points', 'firm', 'filming', 'strained', 'continue', 'film', 'logical', 'relevant', 'progression', 'events', 'Obviously', 'sound', 'crew', '/', 'director', 'were', 'not', 'cognizant', 'fact', 'several', 'instances', 'lines', 'were', 'not', 'delivered', 'coherent', 'understandable', 'fashion', 'were', 'more', 'several', 'instances', 'when', 'spoken', 'audio', 'was', 'totally', 'unintelligible', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'needed', 'resort', 'subtitles', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'being', 'said.Of', 'course', 'DVD', 'also', 'subtitles', 'captions', 'hearing', 'impaired.A', 'higher', 'quality', 'production', 'touching', 'same', 'theme', 'would', 'be', 'film', 'Rendition']",Extraordinary Rendition

We have by our actions internationallybecome a nation with war criminals in the police forces( CIA and FBI?).This film is pretty much the documentary of one of thousands of cases:in this case a Pakistani college professor is kidnapped and tortured.He was innocent and came back alive, but polarized and pretty much psychologically destroyed. Mind and body can take only so much ineven the strongest. I read a tale by a Russian where this kind of treatment was given to political prisoners: he said the best you can dois stop eating and get very sick. They may let you live or not.The alternative of endlessly dying and being revived is enough to break any firm spirit. The practice or deliverance of people without anytrial or real legal process to such treatment is actually recognized since WWII as a war crime by the Geneva convention ( on soldiers or civilians).How do I feel knowing that my country which is supposed to stand forfreedom of expression and civil right is doing this kind of thing?I'm frankly ashamed.

It had the feel of a crimewatch reconstruction at times and the acting was a little wooden, but the themes explored were quite shocking and Andy Serkis managed to be truly menacing in his role of interrogator. The film didn't have a conclusive ending and left me with many unanswered questions. It is relatively short at 77 minutes and it could easily have stretched to 90 and tied up these loose ends. It is a worthy film for the topic it explores alone, it's just a shame it wasn't carried out a little better.
