I had been told by my mother about the Doc Martin series of shows, and I resisted even trying them out, especially with the first one, but once I understood his character, I really enjoyed watching.

As in season one, season two is so well directed, produced and most of all it is fantastically acted.Martin Clunes, as Doc Martin is fantastic as the rather gruff but highly intelligent GP in the small picturesque seaside village of Portwenn.  He still has the worse ""bedside manner"" and tends to speak his mind no matter how rude it may sound which provides for many hysterical moments in the show--you will laugh out loud, trust me.  The village is full of all kinds of very eccentric characters for the Doctor to treat and treat them he does.  In actuality, Doc Martin is really damn good at what he does.  He solves many medical mysteries; however, he has two major problems:  (1) he cannot abide the sight of blood (the reason he's no longer in London as a surgeon) and (2) as I said before, no bedside manners.I loved all eight (8) episodes on three (3) discs in season 2.  Nevertheless, I simply adored the episode called ""Blood is Thicker"" it is about a rather ""Hitchcocken"" family that lives on the ""Moors"" with a vicious dog and a mother that no one has seen for years and years.  It is delightful.  By the way, this family is taxidermies by trade and love to stuff dead animals plus they are overprotective of their mother that no one has actually laid eyes on for a long time plus they are suffering from severe food poisoning which brings in Doc Martin.Buy this season two.

1040249,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B000LQN1LI,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[52, 52]","What makes this British Drama TV series so funny? What's so funny about a surgeon who is mentally and physically indisposed at the sight of blood? Why do you find yourself laughing at the sight of the townsfolk in this serene, beautiful little seaside Cornwall town of Portwenn? It is what happened with most scenes, in all 9 episodes of this 3 DVD series. In almost every scene, I'd lift my eyebrows to the Mrs (we watched together), she'd pick up a corner of her mouth, and we'd both begin laughing.We thoroughly enjoyed the stories and the quirky British people of this small town. Doc Martin (Martin Clunes) and his stern, grumpy, all-business, rude, and seeming heartless bedside manner, just adds to the hilarity--as he fails to see any of the joy in the village. The medical conditions he is faced to address are often as hilarious as the character that complains of the symptoms. Mix with that a love triangle the Doc in involved in, but fails to acknowledge, and you have a season of some of the best British Comedy/Drama ever produced.This second season (Doc Martin: Series 2) is even better than the previously released first season.___For starters, it's 50% longer, 9 50-minute episodes rather than just the 6 in Series One.___The episodes seem to have several plots woven together, much more complex stories, than in the original set. The action moves quickly and keeps you spellbound every minute. You'll be so happy, that by owning the DVD, you don't have to wait a week for the next episode. Episodes do tend to have a carry-over link.___And this series, unlike the original set, has SDH subtitles, something we found to be helpful with some of the dialect as well as British terms. Their biscuit is our cookie, tea is a meal, etc.___Extras include some star cast filmographies.___I still recommend you watch Series One as well, but it's not completely necessary. But after watching series 2 you will want the earlier set.After seeing the zany activity in Doc Martin's surgery (GP office), I decided if American doctors had patients as quirky and strangely symptomatic, all of them would give up and turn to plumbing or painting.This comedy series about a doctor's practice, reminded me of the hugely funny comedy ""Pie In The Sky"", a British comedy/drama about a detective who really wanted to be a cook. I've reviewed both and recommend both.Just a few Details:Episode 1__Doc Martin gets a new receptionist (Katherine Parkinson as Pauline) only better in some ways. He gets in hot water with Aunt Joan (Stephanie Cole), because of her friend Muriel, who's son Danny, reunites with teacher, Louisa (Caroline Catz), whom Doc just recently kissed, a carry-over from Series One. I told you this had some woven plots.2__Doc gets stuck with childcare for Peter while his mother gets stuck in the hospital. Bert Large (Ian McNeice), handyman, fries fish.3__Doc has to compete with a herbal/nature remedy seller who is the sis to Mark (town cop) plus help the odd family with multiple problems who strongly object to house calls. Romantic question: Is Bert the REAL father of Al Large, now falling romantically for the new receptionist after being jilted by her sister?4__Local radio host drinks and Mr. Cooke stinks--really, really stinks. And what's the new town's female bombshell doing with the local cop?5__Mr. Pratt blames Doc for his wife's death but takes revenge by using pesticides that threaten Aunt Joan's organic farm license. Romance is muddled between cop/bombshell, Al/receptionist, and Doc/Louisa while another local teacher battles obsessive-compulsive disorder.6___Doc's parents arrive in town to vex Aunt Joan. Doc forgets his manners while dealing with rapid weight gains of a local 50-year-old lady. Doc has to help his rival in the romantic triangle with Louisa. Doc, finally get's his own often used phrase, ""Shut Up"", told to him.7__Mark (cop) and Al (his best-man after Doc rudely said ""NO"") get lost in the woods, Marks get's a snake bite, they get lost, the crazy forester who lived with a giant squirrel (season one) leads Doc toward them, and of course they both get lost too. Just another day of laughs in the forest.8__Mark has an anatomy problem, his fiancee has her own problem, Doc is involved & making more problems, Danny and Louisa have a problem, the pharmacy neck brace lady has a problem, and Doc muddies the lives of all.9__Birdwatchers, lunatics, explosives, guns, knives, romance and tourism all tickle the funny bone to an explosive degree.Some touching moments, but mostly just beautiful scenery and hilarious activity in the life of a doctor in a small town. You will want more. But you'll have to wait for Series 3. That's the only negative I can state for this DVD set.  ""I want more.""",5,A FUNNY BRITISH TV SERIES FROM 2005-06,1245542400,"06 21, 2009",2009,4743,"['What', 'British', 'Drama', 'TV', 'series', 'funny', 'What', 'so', 'funny', 'surgeon', 'who', 'mentally', 'physically', 'indisposed', 'sight', 'blood', 'Why', 'do', 'find', 'laughing', 'sight', 'townsfolk', 'serene', 'beautiful', 'little', 'seaside', 'Cornwall', 'town', 'Portwenn', 'what', 'happened', 'most', 'scenes', '9', 'episodes', '3', 'DVD', 'series', 'almost', 'scene', ""'d"", 'lift', 'eyebrows', 'Mrs', 'watched', 'together', ""'d"", 'pick', 'up', 'corner', 'mouth', ""'d"", 'begin', 'laughing.We', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'stories', 'quirky', 'British', 'people', 'small', 'town', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'Martin', 'Clunes', 'stern', 'grumpy', 'all-business', 'rude', 'seeming', 'heartless', 'bedside', 'manner', 'just', 'hilarity', 'see', 'joy', 'village', 'medical', 'conditions', 'faced', 'address', 'are', 'often', 'as', 'hilarious', 'character', 'symptoms', 'Mix', 'love', 'triangle', 'Doc', 'involved', 'acknowledge', 'have', 'season', 'best', 'British', 'Comedy/Drama', 'ever', 'second', 'season', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'Series', '2', 'even', 'better', 'previously', 'released', 'first', 'season.___For', 'starters', '50', '%', 'longer', '9', '50-minute', 'episodes', 'rather', 'just', '6', 'Series', 'One.___The', 'seem', 'have', 'several', 'plots', 'woven', 'together', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'stories', 'original', 'set', 'action', 'quickly', 'spellbound', 'minute', ""'ll"", 'be', 'so', 'happy', 'owning', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'wait', 'week', 'next', 'episode', 'Episodes', 'do', 'tend', 'have', 'carry-over', 'link.___And', 'series', 'original', 'set', 'SDH', 'subtitles', 'something', 'found', 'be', 'helpful', 'dialect', 'as', 'well', 'British', 'terms', 'biscuit', 'cookie', 'tea', 'meal', 'etc.___Extras', 'include', 'star', 'cast', 'filmographies.___I', 'still', 'recommend', 'watch', 'Series', 'One', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'completely', 'necessary', 'watching', 'series', '2', 'will', 'want', 'earlier', 'set.After', 'seeing', 'zany', 'activity', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'surgery', 'GP', 'office', 'decided', 'American', 'doctors', 'had', 'patients', 'quirky', 'strangely', 'symptomatic', 'would', 'give', 'up', 'turn', 'plumbing', 'painting.This', 'comedy', 'series', 'doctor', 'practice', 'reminded', 'hugely', 'funny', 'comedy', 'Pie', 'Sky', 'British', 'comedy/drama', 'detective', 'who', 'really', 'wanted', 'be', 'cook', ""'ve"", 'reviewed', 'recommend', 'both.Just', 'few', 'Details', 'Episode', '1__Doc', 'Martin', 'new', 'receptionist', 'Katherine', 'Parkinson', 'Pauline', 'only', 'better', 'ways', 'hot', 'water', 'Aunt', 'Joan', 'Stephanie', 'Cole', 'friend', 'Muriel', 'who', 'son', 'Danny', 'teacher', 'Louisa', 'Caroline', 'Catz', 'whom', 'Doc', 'just', 'recently', 'kissed', 'carry-over', 'Series', 'One', 'told', 'had', 'woven', 'plots.2__Doc', 'stuck', 'childcare', 'Peter', 'mother', 'stuck', 'hospital', 'Bert', 'Large', 'Ian', 'McNeice', 'handyman', 'fries', 'fish.3__Doc', 'compete', 'herbal/nature', 'remedy', 'seller', 'who', 'sis', 'Mark', 'town', 'cop', 'help', 'odd', 'family', 'multiple', 'problems', 'who', 'strongly', 'object', 'house', 'calls', 'Romantic', 'question', 'Bert', 'REAL', 'father', 'Al', 'Large', 'now', 'falling', 'romantically', 'new', 'receptionist', 'being', 'jilted', 'sister', '4__Local', 'radio', 'host', 'drinks', 'Mr.', 'Cooke', 'really', 'really', 'stinks', 'what', 'new', 'town', 'female', 'bombshell', 'doing', 'local', 'cop', '5__Mr', 'Pratt', 'Doc', 'wife', 'death', 'revenge', 'using', 'pesticides', 'threaten', 'Aunt', 'Joan', 'organic', 'farm', 'license', 'Romance', 'muddled', 'cop/bombshell', 'Al/receptionist', 'Doc/Louisa', 'local', 'teacher', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'disorder.6___Doc', 'parents', 'arrive', 'town', 'vex', 'Aunt', 'Joan', 'Doc', 'manners', 'dealing', 'rapid', 'weight', 'gains', 'local', '50-year-old', 'lady', 'Doc', 'help', 'rival', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'Louisa', 'Doc', 'finally', 'get', 'own', 'often', 'used', 'phrase', 'Shut', 'Up', 'told', 'him.7__Mark', 'cop', 'Al', 'best-man', 'Doc', 'rudely', 'said', 'NO', 'get', 'lost', 'woods', 'Marks', 'get', 'snake', 'bite', 'get', 'lost', 'crazy', 'forester', 'who', 'lived', 'giant', 'squirrel', 'season', 'one', 'Doc', 'course', 'get', 'lost', 'too', 'Just', 'day', 'laughs', 'forest.8__Mark', 'anatomy', 'problem', 'fiancee', 'own', 'problem', 'Doc', 'involved', 'making', 'more', 'problems', 'Danny', 'Louisa', 'have', 'problem', 'pharmacy', 'neck', 'brace', 'lady', 'problem', 'Doc', 'lives', 'all.9__Birdwatchers', 'lunatics', 'explosives', 'guns', 'knives', 'romance', 'tourism', 'tickle', 'funny', 'bone', 'explosive', 'degree.Some', 'touching', 'moments', 'mostly', 'just', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'hilarious', 'activity', 'life', 'doctor', 'small', 'town', 'will', 'want', 'more', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wait', 'Series', '3', 'only', 'negative', 'can', 'state', 'DVD', 'set', 'want', 'more']",N/A

He is  a man of few words, orderly, blunt to the point of rudeness, unable to suffer fools gladly, a man of principle and truth and meticulously efficient in his work and work related responsibilities.The  'quirk' is that the 'Doc' gave up his highly successful practice of surgery because he suddenly formed an aversion to blood. This odd complaint (in a doctor)fails to affect his complete competence as a G.P., however, even though often he does get involved in serious and life threatening incidents.As I said, originally, this is a character you either hate or admire.

1040397,A2Q65OXHQY32Q9,B000LQN1LI,Wodehouse Freak,"[5, 5]","Yes, doctor curmudgeon is back to terrify the eccentric villagers of Portwenn. At the time of this review, there were three series of Doc Martin available on DVD in the UK, and I can say with all honesty that this is far and away the best of the three. Here is all eight episodes of series two, with (gasp) a bonus 45-minute behind-the-scenes featurette!So what makes this better than the rest? Besides the bonus? The combined writing powers of Dominic Minghella (who also created the series), Richard Stoneman, and Jack Lothian. Director Ben Bolt is as brilliant as ever. OK, and the all-star cast and guests, but that's a given.The stories are amazing, of course, as evidenced by naming the writers previously, but what appeased me most perhaps is that the villagers are slightly less annoying than in the first series. A few of the supporting characters reappear in interesting plots as well.The unfortunate downer, besides the incredibly annoying anti-piracy thing at the DVD's start, which irritatingly plagues many British DVDs, is the episode entitled 'Out of the Woods', in which Stuart (Ben Miller; Worst Week of My Life, another wonderful dramedy) returns. I have singled out this episode because of how ridiculous it is. Mind you, it can be funny, but there are a few scenes which frankly embarassed me. This minor detail, which I know makes me sound like a whinger, should not detract from how wonderful the entire series is. Except for series three, which I will tackle later.Oh, one last thing: this DVD is rated 15.

He comes in as such a commanding, and domineering personality who expects his edicts  to be followed to the letter, but these villagers have their own agenda, with no disrespect to Doc meant.  Despite how Doc perceives these villagers' intelligence and lack of following his orders, he still gives all and cares for them to the best of his ability.I too get frustrated with some of what I perceive as extraordinarily stupid behaviors but this behavior is a character in the program all on its own.Doc also seems to have no say in who will work for him and how his surgery will be run, but he comes to tolerate this apparent lack of respect, or rather gives up trying to overcome the villagers' will.  Despite how he perceives the villagers' intelligence (low) and their seemingly lack of interest in doing as they are told by him, he still does his gives the very best of his abilities to care for these people.  He takes the responsibility of being the keeper of the villagers' health very seriously.Doc Martin reminds me somewhat of the program Northern Exposure.  Both of these shows have the quirky inhabitants who frustrate the dickens out of their only physician.  Both highlight in an exaggerated way how people are all unique.This review is for all the Doc Martin seasons, and I hope there will be more beyond season 6.Thank you",5,Quirky,1374278400,"07 20, 2013",2013,1437,"['enjoyed', 'quirkiness', 'villagers', 'total', 'frustration', 'Doc', 'over', 'antics', 'such', 'commanding', 'domineering', 'personality', 'who', 'edicts', 'be', 'followed', 'letter', 'villagers', 'have', 'own', 'agenda', 'disrespect', 'Doc', 'meant', 'how', 'Doc', 'villagers', 'intelligence', 'lack', 'following', 'orders', 'still', 'cares', 'best', 'ability.I', 'too', 'get', 'frustrated', 'what', 'perceive', 'extraordinarily', 'stupid', 'behaviors', 'behavior', 'character', 'program', 'own.Doc', 'also', 'have', 'say', 'who', 'will', 'work', 'how', 'surgery', 'will', 'be', 'run', 'tolerate', 'apparent', 'lack', 'respect', 'rather', 'up', 'trying', 'overcome', 'villagers', 'will', 'how', 'villagers', 'intelligence', 'low', 'seemingly', 'lack', 'interest', 'doing', 'are', 'told', 'still', 'very', 'best', 'abilities', 'care', 'people', 'responsibility', 'being', 'keeper', 'villagers', 'health', 'very', 'seriously.Doc', 'Martin', 'somewhat', 'program', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'shows', 'have', 'quirky', 'inhabitants', 'who', 'frustrate', 'dickens', 'only', 'physician', 'highlight', 'exaggerated', 'way', 'how', 'people', 'are', 'unique.This', 'review', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'seasons', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'season', '6.Thank']",N/A
