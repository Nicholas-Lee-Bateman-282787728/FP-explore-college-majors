I saw reviews (which were horrible), so it put me off from it. Seeing the unrated version at a cheap price ($17 for a new movie!), I figured I'd give it a chance.And I'm sure glad that I did. Kevin Bacon gives a stellar performance as someone pushed over the edge. A normal guy that snaps over the murder of his son and seeks revenge on the gang that did it, killing every single one in the process.This movie is vigilante justice at its best! Bacon puts on a great show and communicates well to the audience. You feel his pain and want the bad guys to pay, just like he does.The action is great and gruesome. Coming from one of the Saw guys, you can expect it to be good. It didn't have over the top usage of the word 'f*ck,' which was nice, especially when movies throw it around so much today. Truly a great flick that will keep you on the edge of your seat. You know he is going to kill the whole gang the entire time you are watching the movie, but it does a great job of keeping you guessing as how he is going to accomplish and go about it.My only gripe is how long it takes for Kevin Bacon to exact his revenge. While the acting is good the whole way through, except for the lady detective (which could've been a lot better), I wish there was more action spread throughout. Sure there is some in the beginning, middle, and end, but certainly not constant. This separates this from other action movies as it only happens in segments rather than constantly. That being said, this is actually more of a drama than an action movie and shouldn't really be viewed as one.In the end, I was left wanting more carnage, especially after not seeing Bacon kill the gang leader. So much buildup, yet almost no release, but I can't even see that as making it any better.Verdict: Accept it for what it is and buy it!",5,One of the best revenge movies to date,1204934400,"03 8, 2008",2008,1892,"['wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'theaters', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'chance', 'saw', 'reviews', 'were', 'horrible', 'put', 'off', 'Seeing', 'unrated', 'version', 'cheap', 'price', '17', 'new', 'movie', 'figured', ""'d"", 'give', 'chance.And', ""'m"", 'sure', 'glad', 'did', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'stellar', 'performance', 'someone', 'pushed', 'edge', 'normal', 'guy', 'murder', 'son', 'revenge', 'gang', 'did', 'killing', 'single', 'one', 'process.This', 'movie', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'best', 'Bacon', 'great', 'show', 'well', 'audience', 'feel', 'pain', 'want', 'bad', 'guys', 'pay', 'just', 'does.The', 'action', 'great', 'gruesome', 'Coming', 'one', 'Saw', 'guys', 'can', 'expect', 'be', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'over', 'top', 'usage', 'word', 'f*ck', 'was', 'nice', 'especially', 'when', 'movies', 'throw', 'around', 'so', 'much', 'today', 'Truly', 'great', 'flick', 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'know', 'going', 'kill', 'whole', 'gang', 'entire', 'time', 'are', 'watching', 'movie', 'great', 'job', 'keeping', 'guessing', 'how', 'going', 'accomplish', 'go', 'about', 'it.My', 'only', 'gripe', 'how', 'long', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'exact', 'revenge', 'acting', 'good', 'whole', 'way', 'lady', 'detective', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'action', 'spread', 'Sure', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'certainly', 'not', 'constant', 'other', 'action', 'movies', 'only', 'segments', 'rather', 'constantly', 'being', 'said', 'actually', 'more', 'drama', 'action', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'really', 'be', 'viewed', 'end', 'was', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'carnage', 'especially', 'not', 'seeing', 'Bacon', 'kill', 'gang', 'leader', 'So', 'much', 'buildup', 'yet', 'almost', 'release', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'making', 'better.Verdict', 'Accept', 'what', 'buy']",Death Sentence

1115977,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B000Y7U97I,A. Estes,"[2, 3]","Kevin Bacon stars as the mild-mannered Nick Hume in James Wan's (""Saw,"" ""Dead Silence"") revenge thriller ""Death Sentence."" Hume lives the normal family man life. He's got the nine-to-five job, the picture perfect children and wife at home, and everything seems to be going according to plan until a gang initiation results in the death of his oldest son. Stricken with grief, failed by the justice system, Nick must take matters into his own hands, which, in the end, amounts to more cliches than brilliant new twists for this film.After reinventing the horror genre and creating the best genre franchise since the 80's with ""Saw"", what was James Wan to do next? Apparently, he wanted to spin the action/revenge genre on it's head too. Thankfully for the audience, he gets it right -- most of the time. The ""executions"" are well played, often emotionally tense, and Kevin Bacon is rendered nearly unrecognizable by the end of the flick. Granted, the flick is far from perfect, as Wan has difficulty seperating the emotional moments and the action scenes. Often times, it feels like we are watching two movies. One is an intense, emotionally distressing drama. The other is an over the top homage to 80's action films. Bacon hits all the right notes, and you'll find yourself cheering him on towards the end, but in all honesty, it's a clumsy ride getting there. As someone who enjoyed the brilliant ""Saw"" -- which was both sinister and surprising -- I have to say I'm a little disappointed in Wan's indecisive direction here.Don't get me wrong, it's a good film, but not quite all it could be. The action scenes are well played, especially when it comes to the parking garage, and each actor is spot-on in their roles -- look out for an unhealthy looking John Goodman. But, unfortunately, by the end of the film, we are left with the impression that this movie was meant to spawn off a string of sequels, simultaneously reviving the action-hero genre and Kevin Bacon's career. With a movie that tries to play on your emotions, it's a little bit offensive that they chose to go that route.",3,Death Wish Sentence?,1205452800,"03 14, 2008",2008,2088,"['Kevin', 'Bacon', 'mild-mannered', 'Nick', 'Hume', 'James', 'Wan', 'Saw', 'Dead', 'Silence', 'revenge', 'thriller', 'Death', 'Sentence', 'Hume', 'normal', 'family', 'man', 'life', 'got', 'nine-to-five', 'job', 'picture', 'perfect', 'children', 'wife', 'home', 'everything', 'be', 'going', 'according', 'plan', 'gang', 'initiation', 'results', 'death', 'oldest', 'son', 'Stricken', 'grief', 'failed', 'justice', 'system', 'Nick', 'must', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'end', 'amounts', 'more', 'cliches', 'brilliant', 'new', 'twists', 'film.After', 'reinventing', 'horror', 'genre', 'creating', 'best', 'genre', 'franchise', '80', 'Saw', 'what', 'was', 'James', 'Wan', 'do', 'next', 'Apparently', 'wanted', 'spin', 'action/revenge', 'genre', 'head', 'too', 'Thankfully', 'audience', 'right', 'most', 'time', 'executions', 'are', 'well', 'played', 'often', 'emotionally', 'tense', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'rendered', 'nearly', 'unrecognizable', 'end', 'flick', 'Granted', 'flick', 'far', 'perfect', 'Wan', 'difficulty', 'seperating', 'emotional', 'moments', 'action', 'scenes', 'Often', 'are', 'watching', 'two', 'movies', 'One', 'intense', 'emotionally', 'distressing', 'drama', 'other', 'top', 'homage', '80', 'action', 'films', 'Bacon', 'right', 'notes', ""'ll"", 'find', 'cheering', 'end', 'honesty', 'clumsy', 'ride', 'getting', 'there', 'someone', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'brilliant', 'Saw', 'was', 'sinister', 'surprising', 'have', 'say', ""'m"", 'little', 'disappointed', 'Wan', 'indecisive', 'direction', 'here.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'quite', 'all', 'could', 'be', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'played', 'especially', 'when', 'parking', 'garage', 'actor', 'spot-on', 'roles', 'look', 'out', 'unhealthy', 'looking', 'John', 'Goodman', 'unfortunately', 'end', 'film', 'are', 'left', 'impression', 'movie', 'was', 'meant', 'spawn', 'off', 'string', 'sequels', 'simultaneously', 'reviving', 'action-hero', 'genre', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'career', 'movie', 'play', 'emotions', 'little', 'bit', 'offensive', 'chose', 'go', 'route']",Death Sentence

Of course, it is the modern-day American way: blast a country to smithereens and then accuse them of being barbaric when they revolt against your good intentions. So, bad boy Bacon plays a more sensitive Charles Bronson character in this ""Death"" outing, dishing out some nigh-superheroic revenge against a gang -- made up of Latinos and a token black guy -- that kills his son to get their knockers dusted. But if the point is that gangs are bad, knowing full well that gang warfare consists largely of revenge killings which this film celebrates so much in the guise of a corporate white family, what really is the point here? The only honest moment in this whole wankadoodle is when gang sensei Cheeks McPeters looks over at Kevin ""Overcooked"" Bacon as they share a church pew (don't ask why) and mutters, ""You look like one of us,"" in a chilling, Oscar-worthy moment -- yeah, maybe 60 years ago. The worst part about the film, however, is the fact that all the Latino characters are played by Caucasians.

Watching it only made me feel dirty and ashamed, as if I had been forced to participate in something immoral. Perhaps I was. I willingly paid for my ticket and entered the theater, knowing full well that I could leave anytime I wanted. But maybe it's just as well; having seen it, I can warn others to avoid it. Considering that this is a James Wan film, I can't say that I was expecting much. He is, after all, the same man who directed ""Saw."" I'm no fan of that movie, but at least it knew not to take itself so seriously. ""Death Sentence"" plays like an action film in serious need of a strong antidepressant.The plot concerns Nick Hume (Kevin Bacon), a successful family man whose life falls apart following the murder of his oldest son, Brendan (Stuart Lafferty). The establishing first scenes could have been effective had they not been so manipulative. The film opens with home video footage of the Humes during happier days; they laugh, they play, they open Christmas gifts, and they blow out birthday candles. Is watching this footage supposed to make Brendan's death more heartbreaking? Are we supposed to feel sorry for Nick, knowing that he'll eventually become a crazed vigilante? And let's not forget that (1) Brendan planned on moving to Canada to become a professional Hockey player, and (2) Nick's relationship with Brendan was stronger than with his other son, Lucas (Jordan Garrett). I can't help but feel emotionally swindled--not only is it unnecessary to know any of this, it's also unfair.Brendan's life is cut short at an out-of-the-way gas station, where a group of young gang members kill at random during an initiation ceremony. Nick, who had been filling his car with gas, glimpses one of the members--Joe Darley (Matt O'Leary)--and later picks him out of a police lineup. Unfortunately, little can be done legally: for one thing, Nick doesn't know which specific gang member killed his son (they all wore masks); for another thing, the gas station did not have a surveillance system, meaning Nick's eyewitness account is all the court has to go on. At most, a deal can be made to incarcerate Joe for three to five years. As you might expect, this is clearly not good enough for Nick. He demands justice, and he demands it now.From here on out, the film gets less and less plausible, shifting from a melodramatic tearjerker to a violent, bloody story of revenge. It begins when Nick kills Joe in a fit of blinding rage; this is seen as an act of war, especially in the eyes of Joe's brother, Billy (Garrett Hedlund). His only solution is to kill the remainder of Nick's family, which turns Nick into a paranoid wreck. It also turns him into a spur of the moment stuntman; without so much as an explanation, Nick is able to perform moves usually reserved for unrealistic characters in mindless action films. But this couldn't have been an action film, simply because the story is so solemn. Keep in mind that he's also able to use guns of various calibers, despite having never held a gun in his life. He bought them all from a shady mechanic (John Goodman), a character I didn't believe for one second. I understand that suspension of disbelief is required for a film like this, but I'm sorry, important details like this cannot be overlooked.But the film's biggest problems stem from a complete lack of decency; we're essentially watching a good man turning into what he hates the most, and not in a way that's appropriate given the context of the story. At one point, Billy says to Nick, ""Look what you've become. Look what I made you."" This line could have worked had Nick been willing to redeem himself. But he wasn't; all he cared about was relieving his own pain, and never mind how it would affect his remaining family. I should think that any halfway decent father--even a grieving father--would be able to understand this. He apparently doesn't, even after having the obligatory epiphany; ""It'll never balance,"" he says. ""The equation. It's just chaos."" What? If you really think this dialogue makes sense, let's hope it's because you understand something I don't.But I guess it doesn't matter. So far as I can tell, the sole purpose of ""Death Sentence"" can be interpreted in two ways: either it wants to glorify disgusting acts of revenge, or it wants to teach the audience that revenge isn't the answer. Either way, this film is wrong on so many levels, failing to be meaningful, compelling, or even slightly entertaining. It only succeeds in being reprehensible, exploiting the anger, guilt, and sadness felt by those who have actually lost children to gang violence. I'm saying this from the perspective of someone without children of his own--if I found this movie awful, imagine how a parent would feel. But that's too limiting; I should think the vast majority of the movie going public would be just as turned off by it. This is a sick film, painful to watch and even more painful to remember.",1,"Vengeance is Mine, Saith the Father",1188864000,"09 4, 2007",2007,5059,"['Death', 'Sentence', 'ugly', 'venomous', 'film',

1115991,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B000Y7U97I,DanD,"[1, 1]","Kevin Bacon plays Humes, a businessman with two wonderful children and an adoring wife.  One night, his eldest son is killed as part of a gang initiation; unhappy with the light sentence the killer is destined to receive, Humes decides on a sentence of his own...a death sentence.  But his homicidal mistake soon leads to all-out war, as this mild-mannered businessman is about to go face-to-face with the scum of the earth.  And before long, nobody will be playing nice...Okay.  Let's start with the flaws.  First: ""Death Wish.""  Seen it.  Second: a suburban father who's never fired a gun before suddenly, in the midst of his testimony, decides to become a killer?  It's the stuff of Hollywood, not reality.  Third: the gangbangers all seem wooden, stiff; Garett Hedlund gives it his best, true, but he doesn't have much to work with.  And then there are many of the lines--cliched, trite, you've heard 'em before, and you've seen a lot of these scenes before.  There's nothing really new here.So why watch it?  Plenty of reasons--note the four stars.  The primary reason is, of course, Kevin Bacon.  This is one of the best performances he has delivered in a long time: in the emotional scenes, he'll break your heart; in the angry scenes, he'll terrify you.  Watching Bacon blow away the bad guys is a pure and utter delight.  Another reason to watch this film, and this is going to seem a bit hypocritical: despite the obvious unreality of the plot, a lot of this movie is true-to-life.  During the chase scenes on foot, everybody actually gets winded.  And, yes, Humes actually has to learn how to use a gun before firing it; thank God, he's not some miracle killer (it's also hilarious watching him trying to load the pistol).  And some of the shots are stellar; the chase scene in the parking garage is definitely one of the coolest things I've seen in quite some time.  The shootout in the end, though brief, is incredible; it's somewhat spoiled by the following scene, which tries to elevate the movie beyond the revenge genre it's firmly rooted in, but we can almost forgive the director for wanting to make more of what we're given.""Death Sentence"" is not original, but it's not really meant to be (or, if it is, it doesn't try too hard).  It's a good shoot-em-up, with quite a bit of blood (not on the level of ""Saw,"" no, but more than usual), and even some heart.  You'll probably want to watch it again, which makes it a pretty good movie overall.  If you like this kind of thing, you'll definitely enjoy it.  And if you're just a Kevin Bacon fan...well, then you'll get to see what he looks like with a Britney Spears shaven-head haircut.  A low blow, but I couldn't resist.

1115993,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B000Y7U97I,Dave. K,"[2, 2]","I'm a huge fan of vigilante movies those are my guilty pleasures; even some of the weaker ones of the genre I cannot help, but enjoy. I like the ones where the vigilante is your average person I always find those to work the best and they also have a good what if? If you lost a loved one to a senseless and violent act could you bring yourself to kill the people responsible?Death Sentence is one of the most frustrating movies I have ever seen; the problem is the concept is great and it has all the makings of a great movie, but somewhere along the way something is just missing. What makes it so frustrating is there are some really brilliant moments, but too many average moments that just don't seem to work.The interesting aspect of the movie is a little more time is spent with the villains. But the problem is they aren't very interesting. They are the typical villains only difference is we spend more time with them than most movies like this and we see their side of wanting to avenge the loss of their own. Despite spending more time with them they are the typical villains with no depth to the characters. Again they are just like every villain in this type of movie only more screen time. Having more screen time doesn't mean anything if you fail to do anything with them. It's funny the Hollywood way of villains is shave their head and throw some tattoos on their neck and face and we are meant to fear them, but it doesn't work.Death Sentence is bound to be compared to Death Wish, but every vigilante movie will be compared to it. Death Wish can probably be seen as the holy grail of revenge movies. Every revenge movie since the release of Death Wish in 1974 has been inspired by it. Even if that movie is based on a book, comic or even a remake that came before Death Wish, most revenge flicks follow the format of Death Wish. But let's face it Death Wish is probably the greatest vigilante movie ever made.This time around there is actually a good reason for this being like Death Wish. Death Sentence is based off a novel written by Brian Garfield who wrote the novel for Death Wish, the novel Death Sentence was based off is actually the follow up to Death Wish. The Death Wish franchise though went in a very different direction, but this movie is based off a novel that was the sequel to the original Death Wish novel so they are bound to have a few things in common.Ian Jeffers wrote the screenplay and overall it was very uneven. While by no means was it poorly written, but there were problems. For starters the decision Nick Hume played brilliantly by Kevin Bacon to get revenge on the person who killed his son just came to easy. While there was a brief moment of doubt he just comes to that decision way too easy. I think it should have been more of a build up. Ok granted by doing that it might be a little too much like Death Wish, but Nick comes to his decision a little too easy.Again we come back to the villains they really don't work. There really was no point is showing their side. They murdered an innocent kid in cold blood. It was a senseless act of violence therefore there is no sympathy for them. But more importantly they just aren't interesting. In my opinion they failed to get any emotion out of me. But the one good thing about that story is it shows how violence escalates. Nick's sense of loss drives him to get revenge and the sense of loss the gang feels drives them to avenge their loss. It's very much a double edge sword; what makes this movie stand-out also sort of hurts it.The characters just aren't well developed outside of Kevin Bacon's character; the rest are just very bland and honestly aren't very likeable and it's kind of hard to feel sympathy for any of the victims when there is no emotional attachment to any of them. Overall I wouldn't say the script by Ian Jeffers was bad or anything, but it very much lacks with weak characters and certain aspects not fully developed.Director James Wan who made a name for himself with Saw has flashes of great filmmaking, but too many moments where his scenes just lack the emotion, urgency and the tension. But when Wan gets it right does he ever deliver. There were some slight problems with the script, but any problem could have been fixed with the right directing, but again Wan is very uneven. As I stated prior to Nick getting his revenge on the man that killed his son there is some doubt, but the scene just falls a bit flat and lacked the emotion. Though afterwards Nick does feel some guilt and Wan handles that very well. The attack on Nick's family was a turning point and should have been a very powerful scene, but there is just something missing there. From an emotional side the scene just falls a little flat and that pretty much sums up most of the movie.But there is a lot of good to Death Sentence it has a great gritty look and the violence is really brutal and not done in an entertaining way. While we the audience can root for Nick he is still taking lives even if it's for the right reason he's still murdering people and the violence is shown as the ugly act that it is. All these scenes I have to give James Wan a lot of credit on he really nails it. But like I said some scenes just lack emotion and it just felt as if more really could have been done. There were these great and powerful and deep moments that were set up and very little pay off. I do think James Wan is a director with a lot of potential. Like I said a lot of his scenes lack in some areas, but when he gets it right he delivers. There is potential though for Wan to be an excellent filmmaker, but with Death Sentence he made a very uneven movie.The influences here are quite obvious from Death Wish to Taxi Driver and William Lustig's Vigilante. The problem also with Wan's directing is he relies too much on these films rather than injecting his own style. While a lot will compare this to Death Wish, Death Sentence actually reminds me a lot more of Vigilante.The saving grace of Death Sentence is Kevin Bacon. He delivers what might just be the finest performance of his career. I've always liked Kevin Bacon, but here his performance was mind blowing. He brings so much to the role and while I had respect for him as an actor prior to this I have now gained even more respect for the guy. He had such power on camera and he really draws you in, while his director might have dropped the ball in a few scenes, Bacon though is top notch and really gives a great performance. I would say Kevin Bacon's performance is one of my favorites of 2007; the only performance I enjoyed more from the year was Viggo Mortensen in Eastern Promises.The final act to Death Sentence is excellent. It's suspenseful, gritty, violent and unrelenting. While it does owe a lot to Taxi Driver, these are the scenes where James Wan really shows a lot of potential. Even if what came before was slightly uneven the final act very much delivers and gets the job done. Again no doubt it owes a lot to Taxi Driver, but the final act is still very well done and that again is what makes this so frustrating since there really was a lot of potential here.Overall Death Sentence is a very mixed bag, while there are many solid moments there are too many that lack the emotion needed. The saving grace was Kevin Bacon and is the main reason to check this one out.",3,Kevin Bacon was brilliant in an other wise average flick,1221004800,"09 10, 2008",2008,7346,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'fan',

The police, of course, blame Kevin Bacon and threaten that this time, they pinky-double-swear they're going to arrest him, then they turn their backs so he can slip out a window. Kevin Bacon, shower crier, unable to figure out how to load a gun, suddenly becomes Rambo with a side of Jason Vorhees, firing 16 rounds out of an 8 round pistol, killing gang members in an intricate shootout with supernaturally powerful exploding shotgun shells, etc. As a final insult to the movie watcher, the cops show up after it's all over to shake their heads about all this violence that they did nothing to prevent.Gack, this movie was bad.

Nick,  unconfident that the criminal justice system will administer the appropriate punishment for his son's killer, recants his testimony and the killer goes free.

1116005,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000Y7U97I,Grady Harp,"[40, 45]","DEATH SENTENCE is a tough movie to watch, not because it is a poorly made film, but because of the degree of violence that, once started, is mayhem on a roller coaster ride. Though based on a novel by Brian Garfield, the script by Ian Jeffers is a patchwork quilt - the holes show whenever the police arrive on the scene.  James Wan, of the 'Saw' movies fame, directs with a keen eye for breathless action sequences and almost intolerable suspense timing that makes the film fly through the 111 minutes of the Unrated version.During the opening credits we are introduced to the perfect family via home movies and domestic scenes: Nick Hume (Kevin Bacon) is the devoted father, Helen (Kelly Preston) his bright and loving wife, Brendan (Stuart Lafferty) is the golden boy son with all the hockey laurels, and Lucas (Jordan Garrett) the younger 'also ran' son.  The glitch in this family's happiness happens one night when, out of gas while driving home from a hockey game, Nick stops at a gas station and while Brendan is in the convenience store a gang comes in and murders the store owner and Brendan: the reason for the killing is not robbery but an initiation rite into a gang accomplished by young Joe Darley (Matt O'Leary) and the demand of his older brother Billy (Garrett Hedlund, in a very out of character role from his usual 'Troy', 'Friday Night Lights', 'Eragon', 'Georgia Rule' persona).  Nick witnesses the killing and when the lawyers and police work with him in the aftermath to 'arrange a deal' instead of a murder trial, Nick decides to take matters in hi s own hands.The Darley brothers are part of a ruthless gang sponsored by their own father Bones Darley (John Goodman, in a very dark and well-realized role). Nick stalks Joe Darley and murders him, and once the deed (that happens to begin a gang war against Nick) is done the terror begins.  The gang is out to kill not only Nick but Nick's family also.  How this pursued and pursuers game works out furnishes the remainder of the film.  It is the old eye for an eye story that ends in tragedy for everyone concerned.When the film is dealing with the 'family' and the 'gang' the dialog sparkles, but when the police, headed by Detective Wallis (Aisha Tyler), become involved the aid from the police becomes as ludicrous as the dialog placed in their mouths.  Kevin Bacon gives a bravura performance as the gentle father driven to murderous madness and Garrett Hedlund matches him as the ruthless and terrifying gang leader Billy.  There are enough sidebars about father/son relationships on both sides of the plot line to make the movie have a message.  But in the end it is the wildly frantic camera action and directorial decisions by Wan that make this a horrifying and arresting film.  Not for the queasy viewer.

1116010,APZC5PRJVM0PY,B000Y7U97I,JD,"[0, 0]","An argument can be made for Death Sentence that it has some depth to it, that it is more than a mere revenge action movie.  That is true, you can add as much depth as you want or see no depth to it at all, depending on the type of viewer you are.  I don't think the director pushes any message upon you but leaves much of it open to your own interpretation.  What the movie does depict is the downward spiral that revenge and violence can start you on despite who you are to begin with and to show that there are ultimate consequences as a result of your actions.Death Sentence is about a man who sees his son killed before his eyes and decides to seek his own revenge when the law can't do enough.  Thus starts this man's downward spiral that ultimately consumes him and his family and though, as a father, I felt a certain honesty in his actions, I could never justify them myself.I found Kevin Bacon to be perfectly cast in this movie and I felt he did a great job portraying his character.The movie does have some problems that are quite glaring.

Newscasts were filled with real-life attacks of mindless, inner-city cretins who maimed and murdered for the thrill of it.  These monsters were recognized in the movie since you saw them on the subways and in many cities. NYC's Bernard Goetz became an overnight hero to many when he did what Charles Bronson did: shoot the monsters that terrorized him on the subway.Flash forward to 2007 and we've got the remake: DEATH SENTENCE.  We're supposed to believe that a group of American caucasian males are gang members, with the exception of one minority male. These guys look like your weekend warriors from New Jersey: clean-cut, with attractive tattoes, who like to use to use the F word a lot. The leader spends most of his time in the movie glaring, glaring, glaring at the camera. They all look punks who work at dead-end jobs through the week and then become Hollywood versions of scary looking tough guys. In the original, the killers were real looking: blacks, Latinoes, a few caucasians. They looked so genuine and threatening that you really did believe they could kill and maim without a second thought.And then you've got a scenery chewing John Goodman whose only dialogue throughout seems to be the F word. That's the major problem of this movie. Instead of being real and gritty and showing what real criminals look like and how they behave, you've got a politically correct fantasy that tries not to offend the sensibilities of minorities by showing them in a negative like. The only thugs we see each day are from the inner city. I live in NYC and have yet to see gang members like the ones portrayed in this movie. And trying to imagine how Kevin Bacon suddenly knows all about guns and weapon and how to use them was just too much.

1116013,A60074ZOWMQGX,B000Y7U97I,Joe Banks,"[1, 3]","This is is a raw, disturbing, and surprisingly shallow movie.  While the action scenes were excellent, the script definitely needed some work.  Most of the plot requires a near total suspension of belief and common sense. Consider:1.  A mild mannered exec (Nick Hume) is able to transform himself into a Rambo-like killing machine.  Despite being seriously wounded, he manages take out a whole gang singlehandedly.  He trains himself to use weapons by quickly scanning manuals and posing in the mirror.  All the while, he's popping pain killers like candy.2.  The police claim they will have trouble tying the main suspect to the murder of Hume's son.  This, despite the fact, that Hume can ID him and the guy was hit by a car right outside the murder scene.3.  After two cops are brutally murdered, the attitude of the Detective is that this ""war"" has to end.  Translation:  its too rough for us--just let it go.  In reality, any police force worth their salt would be after the cop killer like white on rice.  In this flick, the main baddie (Darly) was walking around totally undisturbed by the police.4.  The cops also didn't go after Hume, even when they know his new hobby is offing bad guys.  On the other hand, maybe that isn't so far fetched.5.  Goodman's character (Darly's dad) sells Hume guns knowing full well that Hume killed his youngest son and will use the guns to go after his remaining son.6.  Apparently, the cops didn't even question Bone's Darly about his son's whereabouts.  He is more concerned about Hume than the cops.7.  Even though he knows the bad guys are coming for him, Hume is armed only with a baseball bat, not a gun.  He even attempt to send his wife and kid out of town to safety.Overall, this is a very dark film that makes some interesting, if ham-handed, points about just how fragile our civilized existence is.

1116016,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B000Y7U97I,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[2, 2]","""Death Sentence"" is the kind of movie that I thought looked intriguing from the first time I saw a preview for it. However, I was somewhat uneasy about whether the movie would be all that good due to the fact that its director's previous work had been solely in the horror genre. Sure, the director, James Wan, had been successful in his own genre with his smash hit ""Saw"", and had shown an aptitude for chilling audiences to the bone while delivering plenty of twists and thrills along the way, but just because he was successful in that genre didn't mean his success would translate all that well into the realm of action films. But, we were about to find out with ""Death Sentence"" whether James Wan was a director that could successfully jump from genre to genre, as horror master Wes Craven had done previously with his thriller ""Red Eye"", or was he destined to be nothing more than a horror film director who simply had delusions of grandeur.""Death Sentence"" is the story of Nick Hume (Kevin Bacon), a loving father and husband, who is content with his peaceful, quiet life until one fateful night when his eldest son is brutally murdered right before his eyes. Dissatisfied with how the killer's trial will most likely turn out due to a possible deal between the attorney's, Nick opts to take matters into his own hands and deliver his own brand of justice. However, Nick never imagined that his decision to become judge, jury, and executioner would come with such dire consequences as the rest of the gang that the killer belonged to has declared open season on Nick and his family. Now, with his family in danger at almost every turn Nick must end this seemingly never-ending nightmare before it's too late.Well, I've got to say that sometimes it's nice to be wrong about people and your expectations of them. Case in point, I figured that director James Wan was nothing more than a really good horror film director, but with ""Death Sentence"" he has proven that he has what it takes to deliver gripping drama, intense action, and edge-of-your-seat suspense without resorting to buckets of blood, showing myself, and I'm sure many other moviegoers, that there may just be more to this young director than previously believed. Even though James was branching outside of his comfort zone with this film, he still managed to bring in a little of what he knows best by having some of the action sequences be fairly brutal and bloody at times, but to his credit he never over did it with the use of blood. Sure the graphic nature of the fights may have felt a wee bit excessive at times, but then again we are talking about high-powered weapons being used at close range at times, so the results would not be all too pretty and I think Wan handled the action scenes very well.The actors were all great in each of their roles; every actor seemed to bring a richness and depth to every character on the screen. Kevin Bacon (""Hollow Man"") was excellent as Nick Hume; he was such a good family man who was utterly broken when his son was murdered sending him on a downward spiral into anger and despair, while unlocking an almost primal urge to seek vengeance against those who had wronged him and to protect his family no matter the cost. The supporting cast members were equally powerful in their roles from Kelly Preston's (""Sky High"") quiet, yet strong portrayal of Nick's wife, to Garrett Hedlund's cold and calculated leader of the gang, and even John Goodman's psychotic gun-running criminal kingpin. Everyone gave terrific performances, some were even surprising with how good they truly were and how different from anything I had seen them in previously, primarily Garrett Hedlund (""Four Brothers"") and John Goodman (""Coyote Ugly""). I had never seen either of those actors in such dark roles before, but both handled their characters extremely well, and at times were downright chilling in their portrayals.I really appreciated the fact that both director James Wan and star Kevin Bacon (according to the DVD special features) took the time to ensure that Kevin's portrayal of Nick was as a realistic businessman with no apparent weapons training, so that when he finally purchases firearms to deal with the gang, he didn't know how to properly use them. Therefore his character was much more believable than most leads in this type of film, where the character even if they've never had any weapon's experience whatsoever, when the chips are down and it's time to get down to business the lead always knows how to handle any weapon at their disposal, which is obviously unbelievable. So, it was nice to see a revenge-themed movie take a more realistic approach by having the lead appear visibly uncomfortable with the handling of weaponry.""Death Sentence"" is a very gritty, extremely violent revenge thriller that easily knocks the wind out of you early on and never really allows you a moment to catch your breath again until the credits roll. It's not an easy film to watch, but is one that fans of the genre should definitely enjoy.""Death Sentence"" is rated R for violence and language.",4,Protect What's Yours...,1200528000,"01 17,

Emphasis is placed on graphic and (admittedly) eloquently executed violence. Character development and story are given short shrift. There are a whole lot of narrative jumps, so the movie feels pockmarked, like it's missing some kind of connective tissue that will make it seem like a coherent whole, rather than a cobbled-together mosaic of brutality. Oh, and the soundtrack is really, really pushy. Moments that would've had a whole lot of emotional resonance end up feeling tacky because of the sentimental schmaltz that's piped in over the imagery.The story is apparently a sequel to the classic DEATH WISH. A naive businessman named Nick Hume -- father of two strapping lads and husband to a doting wife -- has his world turned upside down when his oldest son is slaughtered as part of a gang initiation. Fearing that the law will not mete the justice that is deserved, he takes matters into his own hands, thus setting in motion a chain of events that quickly spirals out of control as the death count starts clicking into the teens.While there are some truly arresting moments in the movie, there is a curious lack of actual, well, arrests. The police presence in this film is ineffective to the point of being laughable. While maybe that's part of the point -- sometimes cops' hands are tied by legal red tape, ignorance, corruption, or just plain laziness -- it's not a point that's made very well. It's mostly that there's just no cops around. Ever. Even during high-octane shoot-outs and chases through crowded public streets. And when the cops do show up, they are mostly represented by the taciturn Detective Wallis, who spends the bulk of her time tsking Mr. Hume's desire to take the law into his own hands. Even when Hume's hands are bloody and gored up from his battles, Ms. Wallis just frowns. She's like a totem to inertness, only there to deliver tired platitudes like, &#34;Everyone in a war thinks they're right.&#34;The actors do solid work and the editing is top notch, but the wild leaps in logic and the smarmy way the film pretends to be moralistic while just acting as an excuse for some cliched bad-assery (complete with more songs to really hammer the point home), makes the whole thing tired and ridiculous.

How is that? Up until then it was somewhat interesting, borderline exciting, because of the tension of not knowing what the enemies would do next and how Kevin Bacon would protect his family. In general, anytime someone is being stalked in a movie it's always fun for me to watch.Up until this point of the movie, everything had been relatively not horrible. But once his family was executed (which I loved by the way, I loved seeing that overacting, annoying wife get shot), and Kevin Bacon goes into 'revenge mode,' it becomes a predictable, stupid, mindless, video game gunfight, with choreographed scene after scene. It was just anticlimactic and it didn't mean anything. And it didn't help that we never really cared about the characters either.Moronic things in this movie:--When the one son is temporarily missing, and Kevin Bacon goes and finds him at the gas station where his other son was killed. Why did they use the biggest clich&eacute; in movie history by having that son say ""would it have been better if *I had been the one that died?"" Um, how about no. Who ever implied that?? And then he says something about how Kevin Bacon always preferred the other golden boy over him. Where was it EVER implied ANYWHERE in this entire movie that this kind of underlying jealousy/tension was ever being harbored? What a cheap way to try to add depth to a character. Fail.--The scene where Kevin Bacon wakes up in the hospital after being shot, with the detective lady there. Why is she sitting there preaching to this bed-ridden, critically injured person? Just needlessly nagging him about ""what he's gotten himself into."" No idiot, THAT was the conversation that should've taken place back at his home when she initially visited him after his call (and it did). All of THIS is the result of preventive action taken that they both agreed to. In other words, in this isolated incident, which led to Kevin Bacon being hospitalized and his family shot, he did nothing wrong. All of this occurred as a result of the bad guys unrealistically murdering the cops outside and coming into his home. What exactly is she so mad about? What exactly was he to do? Did he deviate in any way from the plan? How can he help it if his house is broken into? She's sitting there bitching to him as if he had gone insane and did something completely irrational, when in fact all he did was get shot.--A few scenes after that, the part where Kevin Bacon is in the hospital room with his dying son, and he asks the detective lady for a few moments of privacy. WHY did she shake her head and roll her eyes, as if to say ""you've gotta be kidding me,"" then leave in disgust?--Too many slow motion montages with loud, overbearing, pretentious music.--I hate that moment in movies where ""the hero is preparing for war,"" and you have these montage shots of the hero that inevitably shows him buying/preparing his weapons, and strapping up (well I hate it in this movie). These shots are usually accompanied by a surprised merchant, surprised at the audacity of the hero to actually be buying all this stuff. At this point the merchant will usually question the hero about his choice of arms, to which the hero will reply back in a very cool way about how he's going to need all this stuff for what he's about to embark on.--Why does every hero in a revenge scenario have to be so COOL and CALCULATING. With these sarcastic one-liners, monotone expression of a scowling face, if monotone could be used to describe something visually. Shouldn't they be a tad bit nervous? Or full of adrenaline? Shouldn't you portray this white-collar businessman who's about to launch into a full fledged murderous rampage as being slightly uneasy?",2,"ah so close, this was ALMOST interesting",1198627200,"12 26, 2007",2007,3964,"['was', 'almost', 'interesting', 'movie', 'had', 'attention', 'good', 'majority', 'time', 'eventually', 'lost', 'momentum', 'headed', 'home', 'stretch', 'goal', 'purpose.Strangely', 'AFTER', 'family', 'killed', 'movie', 'became', 'boring', 'How', 'Up', 'then', 'was', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'borderline', 'exciting', 'tension', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'enemies', 'would', 'do', 'next', 'how', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'would', 'protect', 'family', 'general', 'anytime', 'someone', 'being', 'stalked', 'movie', 'always', 'fun', 'watch.Up', 'point', 'movie', 'everything', 'had', 'been', 'relatively', 'not', 'horrible', 'once', 'family', 'was', 'executed', 'loved', 'way', 'loved', 'seeing', 'overacting', 'annoying', 'wife', 'get', 'shot', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', ""'revenge"", 'mode', 'predictable', 'stupid', 'mindless', 'video', 'game', 'gunfight', 'choreographed', 'scene', 'scene', 'was', 'just', 'anticlimactic', 'did', ""n't"", 'mean', 'anything', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'never', 'really', 'cared', 'characters', 'either.Moronic', 'things', 'movie', 'When', 'one', 'son', 'temporarily', 'missing', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'gas', 'station', 'where', 'other', 'son', 'was', 'killed', 'Why', 'did', 'use', 'biggest', 'clich', 'eacute', 'movie', 'history', 'having', 'son', 'say', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', '*I', 'had', 'been', 'one', 'died', 'Um', 'how', 'Who', 'ever', 'implied', 'then', 'something', 'how', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'always', 'preferred', 'other', 'golden', 'boy', 'Where', 'was', 'EVER', 'implied', 'ANYWHERE', 'entire', 'movie', 'kind', 'underlying', 'jealousy/tension', 'was', 'ever', 'being', 'harbored', 'What', 'cheap', 'way', 'try', 'add', 'depth', 'character', 'Fail.', 'scene', 'where', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'up', 'hospital', 'being', 'shot', 'detective', 'lady', 'there', 'Why', 'sitting', 'there', 'preaching', 'bed-ridden', 'critically', 'injured', 'person', 'Just', 'needlessly', 'nagging', 'what', 'gotten', 'idiot', 'THAT', 'was', 'conversation', 'should', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'place', 'back', 'home', 'when', 'initially', 'visited', 'call', 'did', 'THIS', 'result', 'preventive', 'action', 'taken', 'agreed', 'other', 'words', 'isolated', 'incident', 'led', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'being', 'hospitalized', 'family', 'shot', 'did', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'occurred', 'result', 'bad', 'guys', 'unrealistically', 'murdering', 'cops', 'coming', 'home', 'What', 'exactly', 'so', 'mad', 'What', 'exactly', 'was', 'do', 'Did', 'deviate', 'way', 'plan', 'How', 'can', 'help', 'house', 'broken', 'sitting', 'there', 'bitching', 'had', 'gone', 'insane', 'did', 'something', 'completely', 'irrational', 'when', 'fact', 'did', 'was', 'get', 'shot.', 'few', 'scenes', 'part', 'where', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'hospital', 'room', 'dying', 'son', 'detective', 'lady', 'few', 'moments', 'privacy', 'WHY', 'did', 'shake', 'head', 'roll', 'eyes', 'say', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'be', 'kidding', 'then', 'leave', 'disgust', 'Too', 'many', 'slow', 'motion', 'montages', 'loud', 'overbearing', 'pretentious', 'music.', 'hate', 'moment', 'movies', 'where', 'hero', 'preparing', 'war', 'have', 'montage', 'shots', 'hero', 'inevitably', 'buying/preparing', 'weapons', 'strapping', 'up', 'well', 'hate', 'movie', 'shots', 'are', 'usually', 'accompanied', 'surprised', 'merchant', 'surprised', 'audacity', 'hero', 'actually', 'be', 'buying', 'stuff', 'point', 'merchant', 'will', 'usually', 'question', 'hero', 'choice', 'arms', 'hero', 'will', 'reply', 'back', 'very', 'cool', 'way', 'how', 'going', 'need', 'stuff', 'what', 'embark', 'on.', 'Why', 'hero', 'revenge', 'scenario', 'have', 'be', 'so', 'COOL', 'CALCULATING', 'sarcastic', 'one-liners', 'monotone', 'expression', 'scowling', 'face', 'monotone', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'describe', 'something', 'visually', 'Should', ""n't"", 'be', 'tad', 'bit', 'nervous', 'full', 'adrenaline', 'Should', ""n't"", 'portray', 'white-collar', 'businessman', 'who', 'launch', 'full', 'fledged', 'murderous', 'rampage', 'being', 'slightly', 'uneasy']",Death Sentence

Stathoulopoulos ""nick9155""","[1, 1]","Nobdody wins a gang war, but audiences can win with ultraviolent revenge fantasiesDeath Sentence tells the story of Nick Hume, a successful insurance adjuster who, following the cold blooded murder of his son by lunatic gang members, takes the law into his own hands as a vigilante.  His enemies are a gang led by Billy Darley, a vicious figure who commands a motley crew of cretins in some unnamed American city.  It was filmed in Columbia, South Carolina...but I don't recall them ever mentioning it by name.  What difference does it make?  It could be any city where, naturally, Hume lives in a nice suburb...the gang inhabits some industrial-ghetto dump...the cops are cynics...and your life can be completely ruined by stopping in the wrong gas station at night.  The gang members look like skinhead bikers crossed with urban drug dealers and are not a very likable bunch.  They hang out in a very stylized dump-dive-bar with red lighting and a ragged pay phone.  They answer to a (randomly cast) sleazy John Goodman, who's very good as the demented scion of the gang.The plot significantly departs from Brian Garfield's source novel, though the message is about the same: vigilantism is not the answer.  Death Sentence (the novel) was the sequel to Death Wish, which had its cinematic run from 1974 to 1994 with five films featuring Charles Bronson as 'mild mannered' architect-turned-urban vigilante Paul Kersey.  By the later films, you don't even question it anymore as he orders rocket launchers in the mail and makes booby-trapped wine bottles and soccer ball bombs.  Death Sentence was never actually adapted to the screen, since Garfield did not like the Death Wish films, but it didn't matter back then.  Death Wish 2 is the cinematic sequel to Death Wish, but is not based on Death Sentence, making this film the first one to be based on Garfield's book.  Got it?  Except this film has little to no resemblance to the plot points of the book.Death Sentence focuses on the downward spiral of Nick Hume as his obsession with revenge destroys his family and his being.  His enemies finally seem to relish the fact that they've changed him---in a way, they've won.  Similar to other revenge flicks, Death Sentence forces one to question who really 'wins' in war.In a way, by trying to be more than a straight-up homage or return to the Death Wish movies of the 80s, Death Sentence seems a bit confused, delaying the gratification that we know is on the way.  The unrated version clocks in at close to two hours, and while it takes a couple of unexpected plot turns...ultimately, it does deliver the kind of Bronson-esque violence we've been waiting for.  Despite the message that violence breeds violence and revenge breeds more death and misery...it's hard not to make an exciting vigilante movie where the audience does not root for the hero.  Yes, the obsession with revenge destroys people...but it always feels so good (and right) to blast unredeemable criminal scum with a massive firearm.James Wan employs a similar visual look as he did in Saw: very sharp definition, plenty of music video-atmospheric lighting, and of course the 360-degree spinning camera while rock music plays...this time while Kevin Bacon prepares for his 'war'.  The only thing missing, criminally, is a scene of Bacon making or modifying bullets in true Death Wish-style.  The climax is pretty ridiculous.  Somehow, with his obsession for revenge, Hume becomes a more-than-capable shot, becomes a tough guy, and basically becomes as violent and murderous as his prey...presumably the point.  There is an homage to Taxi Driver, subtle only to those who've...never seen Taxi Driver.  The shaved head...the fingers blown off...the shot in the neck...yes, it's Travis Bickle all over again.  Kevin Bacon is very good, his transformation from mild-mannered executive to angel of death complete with sunken eyes, grim expression, bald dome, and double barreled shotgun.  Since he does not appear to age, Bacon still looks pretty beaten down by the end, a coup for the makeup department.The DVD looks and sound great, featuring both the theatrical version and the unrated version.  Presumably, the unrated version is the 'director's cut', of sorts...though these days, there always seems to be a director's cut above and beyond the unrated versions.  I don't expect that they've cut anything that might reveal the secrets of life.

1116037,A2GFZT48YTZASN,B000Y7U97I,Pavelow,"[1, 1]","Another Revenge genre film, this time directed by James Wan (Saw; Dead Silence) staring Kevin Bacon as Nick Hume, a normal boring guy with a standard family of wife and two sons.  He works at an insurance company as an executive officer calculating risk factors.  On the way home from his son's hockey game he has to stop at a gas station in a very sordid part of town.  A random act of violence leaves his son murdered and his life in shambles.  Seeing that the gang member is about to get off lightly, Nick Hume takes the law into his own hands.  The film works and it doesn't at the same time.  Bacon provides an excellent portrayal of an everyday guy sucked into the vortex of revenge.  His acting is solid and believable.  Unfortunately, we all know that even though our character Nick Hume knows no marital arts, doesn't own a gun or even knows how to handle one, and can't fight his way out of a paper bag...we all know that Kevin Bacon has a reputation as the Bad Boy actor.  So even though he is believable in his portrayal, he's not.  Still, the directing was tight and imaginative, especially during the foot chase scene in the parking garage.  It will get your heart pumping as the camera work was invented just for the scene (watch the DVD extras).  The twists and turns and screenplay are predictable (like we didn't expect two cops in a car guarding the residence NOT to get killed?), yet some of our players compliment the effort.  John Goodman puts in an outstanding performance as the gang-leader's father.  Wow, don't mess with this guy!  But, others barely show up, Kelly Preston as Helen Hume and Aisha Tyler as Detective Wallis.  I'll have to give them the benefit of the doubt, though, because the screenplay didn't give them much to work with.  All in all worth a look if you enjoy this genre.

The only thing he could tell me about it was ""It has that Kevin Bacon guy"" in it.  Several other people on here have given long and involved plot synopsis, so I won't go there.  Instead I'll give you this:  Kevin Bacon has what appears to be the perfect family until his oldest son is killed by a gang member for initiation, his search for justice leads him down the road to revenge.The Good:-The acting is quite good in this movie, other than John Goodman who is a bit over the top.-Once the blood starts flowing, there is a fairly good amount of it-Pretty good action scenes-The ending, though predictable, was pretty good.The Bad:-Glaring plot holes-Once again the police are portrayed as completely retarded.-Gangs are rarely such a nice cross-section of demographics, and they most certainly are not capable of being SO disorganized and then suddenly so completely militarily organized from scene to scene.  These guys came across as a high school wanna-be gang who MIGHT be capable of pawning off some weed on middle school kids, but then suddenly they are armed to the teeth, able to overtake police officers, evade security systems, and run a high level drug making facility.  Huh?-Shaving Kevin Bacon's head makes him into Charles Bronson...-What a waste of John Goodman in a part that should have been more well scripted.-The tender moments that should have brought a tear to your eye, didn't.  Because you are busy trying to figure out why the police haven't figured out what's going on yet... and how they managed to build a parking garage so far out of building code, or where the scenes must have been that explained the abandoned mental hospital, or why someone is able to carry a crazy looking package into a business building, make death threats and be out on the street that evening.On the whole, if you are looking for mindless entertainment and don't have any problems with plot holes, you can probably enjoy this film.

1116040,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000Y7U97I,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Death Sentence (James Wan, 2007)James Wan has been oddly underrated since helming the smash hit Saw. He didn't direct anything, in fact, for three years, but then came a double-whammy of impressive proportions. First was Dead Silence, another horror flick that unjustly faded into obscurity within a couple of months. Seek it out, it's better than most of what Hollywood's done in the horror arena since Saw (including every sequel in that franchise). Then came Death Sentence hot on its heels, a revenge-killer action pic that does it better than anything since, arguably, the original Death Wish. This shouldn't necessarily be a surprise; the original novel upon which this film is based was Garfield's sequel to Death Wish.Nick Hume (Kevin Bacon) is a happy guy. He's got a loving wife, Helen (Jerry Maguire's Kelly Preston, finally getting her career back on track after Battlefield Earth), and two kids, budding hockey star Brendan (Stuart Lafferty in his big-screen debut) and school roustabout Lucas (Thank You for Smoking's Jordan Garrett). All is going well until Nick and Brendan have a run-in with a small-time gang led by Billy Darley (Eragon's Garrett Hedlund). Nick indulges in a rash act of revenge, not realizing that what he's really doing is starting a war...Man, the cast on this movie alone (did I mention John Goodman? Aisha Tyler? Edi Gathegi? No? I have now.) should have put it in three thousand theaters and gotten it top-priority publicity. Instead, it made a little over half that in opening screens, and within a month it was playing on less than 150. No publicity at all. That's a crime. Wan has a delicate touch with a camera, which would seem to be at odds with the material he chooses to film. It's not. Wan's camerawork is what made Saw a worthwhile film while all of its sequels (save, arguably, the first) have been useless. It made Dead Silence one of the most effective horror films released in 2007. And it turns what could have been another brainless action flick into a brooding study of the escalation of violence.This is not to say it's the perfect film; far from it. Aisha Tyler's character, a police detective, seems almost an afterthought. (She is balanced out by John Goodman as the father of the gang's leader, who plays one of those deliciously quirky characters he's so good at playing.) The end of the film plays out far more like the Hollywood action flick you think it is than anything remotely plausible. (It's an homage to another action flick, but telling you which would be a spoiler--and no, it isn't Death Wish.) But this is solid, solid, solid. Too many action films coming out of Hollywood since Death Wish have had an implicit (or explicit) ""brainless"" attached to ""action""; it only makes sense that it's a sequel to Death Wish that brings the intelligence back to the genre.

The story even occasionally deviates from the standard revenge story by addressing the physical and psychological burden of taking the law into your own hands. Bacon plays a successful corporate executive whose rising hockey star son gets killed by a gang in the midst of a gas station stick-up and finds that the legal system is reluctant to do anything serious about it. In giving the killer a taste of his own medicine Bacon incurs the wrath of the killer's even more vicious gang leader brother and his band of bloodthirsty marauders. After a series of tragic events Bacon decides to take his campaign of Old Testament vengeance to the next level. To quote Keanu Reeves in THE MATRIX, ""Guns. Lots of guns."" Plus a ton of bloodshed and brutality that only the director of the wince-inducing original SAW could deliver in high gruesome style (Wan's SAW cohort Leigh Whannell plays one of the gang members). DEATH SENTENCE is a tightly-paced hardcore violent thriller of the old school in the tradition of VIGILANTE and THE EXECUTIONER, and Kevin Bacon's credible transformation from a peaceful family man to a roaring rampage of revenge would make Charles Bronson proud.

Think again.Death Sentence was so silly at times that any merit of ""good movie"" completely evaporated in scene after scene. Like the grand-daddy of them all,Death Wish, Death Sentence is a revenge movie. Unlike Death Sentence, Death Wish is also a vigilante movie; Death Sentence is straight up revenge.The movie starts with a horrifying, somewhat realistic scene that made me just want to hug my own son and never let go. Then the horrifying and realistic quickly exit for the rest of the movie. Enter the silly and unbelievable.Kevin Bacon's performance is fair at best as an 'average' soccer (or should i say hockey) dad bent on revenge. His character puts himself in unreal situations, and...he's super-human! The police seem to never arrive and are complete buffoons (as is pretty much always in Hollywood). The 'enemy' or antagonist(s) in Death Sentence are poorly portrayed gang stereotypes.

Guess I'm very much like Bacon's role in this movie. I think most parents would, given the choices that the father, Nick Hume (Bacon) had, would seriously consider doing the same thing--vigilante justice.  If you've seen and liked The Crow, The Punisher and/or Hard To Kill, you should enjoy this movie.  It's directed by Wan who directed Saw I so you should know what you are getting in for--so if you are easily offended by extreme violence, stay away.  However if you can handle watching a father get his justice for his son then watch away. I really liked the ending because Billy (the gang leader played by the talented, attractive Garrett Hedlund) thinks he has changed Nick Hume but by how Nick responds to him, I saw that he did not change him in the way Billy thought. I want to say so much more but don't want to spoil it if you haven't seen it.Many will judge this, many will see flaws in the movie and that is what critiquing is about, but how many will see the Love in this movie? That is what I see and that is why I love it.I've always loved Bacon.  In the special features there's a great section in which he speaks about how he prepares for his roles.  I found it very interesting and would mention that it is good for anyone wanting to be an actor to listen to and learn from.  Bacon sharing this information, to me, proves his quality because the majority of actors would not share these brilliant ideas.  Bacon is a real man and a talented, devoted actor.

From a warm and loving father Hume quickly descends into the savagery of the gang members who killed his son and who fight back against his unequivocal form of rough justice. Bacon portrays the wounded father brilliantly and as the film progresses his physical appearance changes with his state of mind. He becomes more pale and wan and gets more jittery and anxious looking, until finally he ends up with a shaven head and wild look in his eyes. The soundtrack for this film is excellent and very atmospheric, many scenes are heightened by the music selected for it and the early scenes are quite emotional as the family deal with the loss of a treasured member. This has a pretty standard vigilante thriller storyline, but it pulls it off better than some others I've seen recently and although I have seen Bacon act better in other films, he is very respectable and gritty here. All in all this is a good thriller and has some dark themes that get you thinking about how you would react in similar circumstances, although this particular man goes to extremes!

It was panned as being ugly, violent, depressing and unrealistic.  Naturally I had to see it.  I'm a sucker for the good ol' vigilante/revenge subgenre of crime dramas.  It's incredibly satisfying to me to see the average Joe pushed too far and slaughtering tough guy wannabes(the bloodier the better mind you).  Most of these kinds of films tend to break your heart in the first act, then by the end of the film you're cheering on the bloody retribution.Death Sentence was based on a book by Brian Garfield, who also penned the novel Death Wish, therefore the plot is similar.  In this case, Kevin Bacon loses one of his two sons early in the film to a gang initiation.  We all know the wheels of justice are useless in these films, and Bacon may have known that too coz he refuses to testify against the suspect and lets him walk.  Why?  He's got his own plans, and I'll bet you know what they are!  Blinded by rage, Bacon doesn't quite consider the possible backlash of what he's about to do, and opens a very nasty can of worms.  The loyal gang seeks retribution for themselves and a violent war begins.Though the action tends to get a bit more typical action movie-like near the final act, the film does make an attempt to address the emotional and psychological issues of seeking your own justice and the effect it may have on your life and family.  Bacon spends most of the film looking almost confused about what he's doing or should do.  Even when he dons the black leather jacket and shaves his head(you know the poop's gonna fly then), he seems a bit klutzy.  He definitely runs the gamut of emotions throughout the course of the film.  Hell, after the first ten minutes or so he never smiles again(at least I don't recall that he does).People seem kinda mixed on this movie.  It does seem rather uneven with the drama(which I think was handled well actually), and the comic bookness that it evolves into.Personally I don't care if the violence is unrealistic nor do I care that Bacon seems almost indestructible.  I want Kevin Bacon to plow through everybody!  I want him to shoot off limbs and barely escape from the seat of his pants(he owes alot to luck in his escapes)!  I want him to blow these rotten turds to kingdom come and I don't care if he goes about it as a seemingly invincible juggernaut.  After all, it's not like Death Wish wins awards for realism.  I mean, Bronson got mugged every time he left his apartment!  This is what I like about vigilante movies, I like things to go their way, God knows it doesn't in real life.  Since this is from the diretcor of Saw, expect some bloody deaths, but it's actually not as bad as people have said, even in it's Unrated version.  Though Bacon may be not be the tough guy Bronson was, and the Death Wish movies I feel are some of the most entertaining films out there(especially part 3), I felt Death Sentence was an exceptional revenge flick.",4,Recipe For Revenge: BACON-Hot and Sizzlin',1204416000,"03 2, 2008",2008,3022,"['read', 'reviews', 'movie', 'newspapers', 'when', 'what', 'released', 'reviews', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'positive', 'was', 'panned', 'being', 'ugly', 'violent', 'depressing', 'unrealistic', 'Naturally', 'had', 'see', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'good', 'ol', 'vigilante/revenge', 'subgenre', 'crime', 'dramas', 'incredibly', 'satisfying', 'see', 'average', 'Joe', 'pushed', 'too', 'far', 'slaughtering', 'tough', 'guy', 'wannabes', 'bloodier', 'better', 'mind', 'Most', 'kinds', 'films', 'tend', 'break', 'heart', 'first', 'act', 'then', 'end', 'film', ""'re"", 'cheering', 'bloody', 'retribution.Death', 'Sentence', 'was', 'based', 'book', 'Brian', 'Garfield', 'who', 'also', 'penned', 'novel', 'Death', 'Wish', 'therefore', 'plot', 'similar', 'case', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'one', 'two', 'sons', 'early', 'film', 'gang', 'initiation', 'know', 'wheels', 'justice', 'are', 'useless', 'films', 'Bacon', 'may', 'have', 'known', 'too', 'testify', 'suspect', 'walk', 'Why', 'got', 'own', 'plans', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'Blinded', 'rage', 'Bacon', ""n't"", 'quite', 'consider', 'possible', 'backlash', 'what', 'do', 'very', 'nasty', 'can', 'worms', 'loyal', 'gang', 'retribution', 'violent', 'war', 'action', 'get', 'bit', 'more', 'typical', 'action', 'movie-like', 'final', 'act', 'film', 'make', 'attempt', 'address', 'emotional', 'psychological', 'issues', 'seeking', 'own', 'justice', 'effect', 'may', 'have', 'life', 'family', 'Bacon', 'most', 'film', 'looking', 'almost', 'confused', 'what', 'doing', 'should', 'do', 'Even', 'when', 'black', 'leather', 'jacket', 'head', 'know', 'poop', 'gon', 'fly', 'then', 'bit', 'klutzy', 'definitely', 'gamut', 'emotions', 'course', 'film', 'Hell', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'so', 'never', 'again', 'least', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', '.People', 'seem', 'kinda', 'mixed', 'movie', 'seem', 'rather', 'uneven', 'drama', 'think', 'was', 'handled', 'well', 'actually', 'comic', 'bookness', 'into.Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'violence', 'unrealistic', 'do', 'care', 'Bacon', 'almost', 'indestructible', 'want', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'plow', 'everybody', 'want', 'shoot', 'off', 'limbs', 'barely', 'escape', 'seat', 'pants', 'alot', 'luck', 'escapes', 'want', 'blow', 'rotten', 'turds', 'kingdom', 'come', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'about', 'seemingly', 'invincible', 'juggernaut', 'not', 'like', 'Death', 'Wish', 'awards', 'realism', 'mean', 'Bronson', 'got', 'mugged', 'time', 'left', 'apartment', 'what', 'like', 'vigilante', 'movies', 'like', 'things', 'go', 'way', 'God', ""n't"", 'real', 'life', 'diretcor', 'Saw', 'expect', 'bloody', 'deaths', 'actually', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'people', 'have', 'said', 'even', 'Unrated', 'version', 'Bacon', 'may', 'be', 'not', 'be', 'tough', 'guy', 'Bronson', 'was', 'Death', 'Wish', 'movies', 'feel', 'are', 'most', 'entertaining', 'films', 'there', 'especially', 'part', '3', 'felt', 'Death', 'Sentence', 'was', 'exceptional', 'revenge', 'flick']",Death Sentence

In my eyes, Death Sentence was EASILY my favorite film I saw in 2007.  I saw the film in theaters and absolutely adored it in every single way. What makes the film more special to me is the actual drama that is built up.  This is one of the few films that I ever felt like crying in due to the events that occur.  This has much more to offer than just your average shoot'em up action/revenge flick.  This film has a very dramatic story about a father who seeks revenge for his oldest son who was brutally killed.  Instead of just letting the courts decide, he begins to decide the action that should take place.  For some that may seem unrealistic.  For me, it shows how the justice system truly is...the criminal always has more rights. The revenge story goes from there, but what sets this film apart from other revenge stories?Death Sentence is special due to many key factors.  The film itself does not rely on just fight scenes or chase scenes to make it exciting.  The photography of this film is absolutely incredible.  So many cool shots.  Whether they are used for a more effective action scene, or to make a scene more dramatic; the photography of the film is spot on.  There is a great chase scene and the way it's shot is really cool and largely creative. For those seeking action you can surely find it here as well.  The film is filled with many cool stunts and special effects. There were many action scenes where I kept thinking, ""God, that was awesome."" Suspense and action builds throughout the entire film and really doesn't let go. The acting seems to be questioned in some of the reviews I have seen previously.  Ill tell you, its quite hard to find action/revenge thrillers that have some really good acting.  It is not hard to find here.  Kevin Bacon gives yet another powerful performance as the revengeful father.  Sure there may be a few scenes with him that may be slightly hard to believe, like learning to shoot/use a gun so quick, but he is very much believable in this role.  He is not really a Terminator like figure here like many action films have their main protagonist character to be. Almost all the acting here is wonderful, especially taking into account what type of film this is.  The music done for the film blows me away completely.  The score sets such a brooding undertone for the film and makes it feel so dark, yet largely dramatic.For those who take a more simplistic approach to watching films, those who just want to be entertained and could care less about my rambling about the photography and such will be entertained by this thriller.  The film is certainly not a slow one and it offers everything you could want in a revenge movie: drama, action, suspense, and dark overtones.  It's all here in this incredible film. If you love movies like Death Wish then I'm sure you will like this as well. I never understood some of the lower rating for the film, but I know many who loved it as I do.  I can not recommend a movie more than this.  I adore this film.  It is truly nice to see a movie that is a true action thriller.  It doesn't wuss out and become something it isn't meant to be like so many films today.",5,A Truly Dark Thriller,1199750400,"01 8, 2008",2008,3313,"['Here', 'recent', 'years', 'been', 'really', 'hard', 'find', 'really', 'good', 'hard', 'hitting', 'revenge', 'thriller', 'such', 'came', 'out', '70s', '80s', 'eyes', 'Death', 'Sentence', 'was', 'EASILY', 'favorite', 'film', 'saw', '2007', 'saw', 'film', 'theaters', 'absolutely', 'adored', 'single', 'way', 'What', 'film', 'more', 'special', 'actual', 'drama', 'built', 'up', 'one', 'few', 'films', 'ever', 'felt', 'crying', 'due', 'events', 'occur', 'much', 'more', 'offer', 'just', 'average', ""shoot'em"", 'up', 'action/revenge', 'flick', 'film', 'very', 'dramatic', 'story', 'father', 'who', 'revenge', 'oldest', 'son', 'who', 'was', 'brutally', 'killed', 'Instead', 'just', 'letting', 'courts', 'decide', 'decide', 'action', 'should', 'take', 'place', 'may', 'seem', 'unrealistic', 'how', 'justice', 'system', 'truly', 'criminal', 'always', 'more', 'rights', 'revenge', 'story', 'there', 'what', 'film', 'apart', 'other', 'revenge', 'stories', 'Death', 'Sentence', 'special', 'due', 'many', 'key', 'factors', 'film', 'not', 'rely', 'just', 'fight', 'scenes', 'chase', 'scenes', 'make', 'exciting', 'photography', 'film', 'absolutely', 'incredible', 'So', 'many', 'cool', 'shots', 'are', 'used', 'more', 'effective', 'action', 'scene', 'make', 'scene', 'more', 'dramatic', 'photography', 'film', 'spot', 'great', 'chase', 'scene', 'way', 'shot', 'really', 'cool', 'largely', 'creative', 'seeking', 'action', 'can', 'surely', 'find', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'filled', 'many', 'cool', 'stunts', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'many', 'action', 'scenes', 'where', 'kept', 'thinking', 'God', 'was', 'awesome', 'Suspense', 'action', 'builds', 'entire', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'acting', 'be', 'questioned', 'reviews', 'have', 'seen', 'previously', 'Ill', 'tell', 'quite', 'hard', 'find', 'action/revenge', 'thrillers', 'have', 'really', 'good', 'acting', 'not', 'hard', 'find', 'here', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'yet', 'powerful', 'performance', 'revengeful', 'father', 'Sure', 'may', 'be', 'few', 'scenes', 'may', 'be', 'slightly', 'hard', 'believe', 'learning', 'shoot/use', 'gun', 'so', 'quick', 'very', 'much', 'believable', 'role', 'not', 'really', 'Terminator', 'figure', 'here', 'many', 'action', 'films', 'have', 'main', 'protagonist', 'character', 'be', 'Almost', 'acting', 'here', 'wonderful', 'especially', 'taking', 'account', 'what', 'type', 'film', 'music', 'done', 'film', 'away', 'completely', 'score', 'sets', 'such', 'brooding', 'undertone', 'film', 'feel', 'so', 'dark', 'yet', 'largely', 'dramatic.For', 'who', 'take', 'more', 'simplistic', 'approach', 'watching', 'films', 'who', 'just', 'want', 'be', 'entertained', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'rambling', 'photography', 'such', 'will', 'be', 'entertained', 'thriller', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'slow', 'one', 'everything', 'could', 'want', 'revenge', 'movie', 'drama', 'action', 'suspense', 'dark', 'overtones', 'here', 'incredible', 'film', 'love', 'movies', 'Death', 'Wish', 'then', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'like', 'as', 'well', 'never', 'understood', 'lower', 'rating', 'film', 'know', 'many', 'who', 'loved', 'do', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'more', 'adore', 'film', 'truly', 'nice', 'see', 'movie', 'true', 'action', 'thriller', ""n't"", 'wuss', 'out', 'become', 'something', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'today']",Death Sentence

1116053,AUB7WXM7IX81,B000Y7U97I,Timothy I. Morgan Jr.,"[2, 3]","*CONTAINS SPOILERS*Kevin Bacon plays Nick Hume, a risk assessor for an insurance company with a life as ordinary and mundane as any put on screen, that is of course, until he is driven is vigilante violence when his son is brutally killed in a gang initiation.  This killing occurs in a very bad neighborhood, one that Nick should know better than to be driving through.  Putting that aside, rather than see the killer spend only a few years in jail, he impulsively recants his testimony at trial and goes to take justice into his own hands, setting the stage for a series of graphic murders in retaliation.For someone as smart and successful as Nick Hume, this man sure makes a lot of bad decisions.  He arrives to confront this killer in his business suit, standing out as much as possible in a slum neighborhood so that he can be easily identified by a gang member's sister.  As he is being pursued by this gang later on, he tosses his briefcase, which contains his wallet.  And does it come as any surprise that the gang goes after his family shortly after?  He simply doesn't think ahead.  We know his grief is supposed to cloud his judgment, but horror movies victims wouldn't be this foolish.  And of course, the cops are all incompetent, letting him escape from their clutches later in the movie in a rather unbelievable fashion.Apart from a few effective scenes, this movie is a mess.  Director James Wan wants to infuse the movie with the moral ambiguities of ""Death Wish"" and capture the mood of ""Taxi Driver,"" and attempts to do so with a number of obvious parallels, but he was much better at providing this sort of layered subtext in ""Saw"" (the first one, before the series started to approach self-parody).  While ""Death Wish"" was no masterpiece, it was certainly far superior to what's on display here.  Wan desires to examine the moral and physical consequences of vigilante justice, but the results are half-hearted.  The movie, much like its characters, is too stupid to do this effectively.  Apparantly, the producers recognized this too, dumping the film at the end of the summer release schedule, where it appropriately bombed.Despite the many flaws of his character, both in terms of development and actions, Kevin Bacon is actually quite good in the lead.  His performance is absolutely chilling, especially at the end, when he decides to basically go on a killing spree.  The final showdown is pretty ludicrous, but never for a moment did I question Bacon's conviction and resolve during that scene.  The rest of the acting is pretty standard, with the exception of John Goodman, who is horrible.  His scenery-chewing dialogue is laughable, as is his presentation of it.  His character also makes no sense whatsoever, especially when his ""big twist"" is revealed.There are other, better movies on the subject of vigilante justice.  Watching Kevin Bacon hunt down lowlife vermin is enjoyable on a visceral level, but the suspension of disbelief required for it is pretty heavy.  The various instances of ambiguity Wan includes are pointless and only underline how pretentious this movie really is.  If you're in the mood for a good action flick, this isn't quite the right choice, although there are worse alternatives out there.  If you're in the mood for a good drama, the conflicting themes here can't warrant a recommendation.  This film doesn't really succeed on any level; it's not unwatchable, but it is very unsatisfying.",2,Ambitious but ultimately pretentious,1208217600,"04 15, 2008",2008,3452,"['*CONTAINS', 'SPOILERS*Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Nick', 'Hume', 'risk', 'assessor', 'insurance', 'company', 'life', 'ordinary', 'mundane', 'put', 'screen', 'course', 'driven', 'vigilante', 'violence', 'when', 'son', 'brutally', 'killed', 'gang', 'initiation', 'killing', 'occurs', 'very', 'bad', 'neighborhood', 'one', 'Nick', 'should', 'know', 'better', 'be', 'driving', 'Putting', 'aside', 'rather', 'see', 'killer', 'spend', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'jail', 'impulsively', 'testimony', 'trial', 'take', 'justice', 'own', 'hands', 'setting', 'stage', 'series', 'graphic', 'murders', 'retaliation.For', 'someone', 'smart', 'successful', 'Nick', 'Hume', 'man', 'sure', 'lot', 'bad', 'decisions', 'confront', 'killer', 'business', 'suit', 'standing', 'out', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'slum', 'neighborhood', 'so', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'identified', 'gang', 'member', 'sister', 'being', 'pursued', 'gang', 'later', 'briefcase', 'wallet', 'come', 'surprise', 'gang', 'family', 'shortly', 'simply', ""n't"", 'think', 'ahead', 'know', 'grief', 'supposed', 'cloud', 'judgment', 'horror', 'movies', 'victims', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'foolish', 'course', 'cops', 'are', 'incompetent', 'letting', 'escape', 'clutches', 'later', 'movie', 'rather', 'unbelievable', 'fashion.Apart', 'few', 'effective', 'scenes', 'movie', 'mess', 'Director', 'James', 'Wan', 'infuse', 'movie', 'moral', 'ambiguities', 'Death', 'Wish', 'capture', 'mood', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'attempts', 'do', 'so', 'number', 'obvious', 'parallels', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'providing', 'sort', 'layered', 'subtext', 'Saw', 'first', 'one', 'series', 'started', 'approach', 'self-parody', 'Death', 'Wish', 'was', 'masterpiece', 'was', 'certainly', 'far', 'superior', 'what', 'display', 'here', 'Wan', 'examine', 'moral', 'physical', 'consequences', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'results', 'are', 'half-hearted', 'movie', 'much', 'characters', 'too', 'stupid', 'do', 'effectively', 'Apparantly', 'producers', 'recognized', 'too', 'dumping', 'film', 'end', 'summer', 'release', 'schedule', 'where', 'appropriately', 'bombed.Despite', 'many', 'flaws', 'character', 'terms', 'development', 'actions', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'lead', 'performance', 'absolutely', 'chilling', 'especially', 'end', 'when', 'basically', 'go', 'killing', 'spree', 'final', 'showdown', 'pretty', 'ludicrous', 'never', 'moment', 'did', 'question', 'Bacon', 'conviction', 'resolve', 'scene', 'rest', 'acting', 'pretty', 'standard', 'exception', 'John', 'Goodman', 'who', 'horrible', 'scenery-chewing', 'dialogue', 'laughable', 'presentation', 'character', 'also', 'sense', 'whatsoever', 'especially', 'when', 'big', 'twist', 'are', 'other', 'better', 'movies', 'subject', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'Watching', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'hunt', 'down', 'lowlife', 'vermin', 'enjoyable', 'visceral', 'level', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'required', 'pretty', 'heavy', 'various', 'instances', 'ambiguity', 'Wan', 'are', 'pointless', 'only', 'underline', 'how', 'pretentious', 'movie', 'really', ""'re"", 'mood', 'good', 'action', 'flick', ""n't"", 'quite', 'right', 'choice', 'are', 'worse', 'alternatives', 'out', 'there', ""'re"", 'mood', 'good', 'drama', 'conflicting', 'themes', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'warrant', 'recommendation', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'succeed', 'level', 'not', 'unwatchable', 'very', 'unsatisfying']",Death Sentence

It's even more surprising that this Paul Kersey-free version retains at least some of the moral complexities despite being even more heavily changed for the screen than the original film. This time Kevin Bacon's the family man driven to take the law into his own hands when the gang member who murdered his son in a gang initiation killing faces only a cursory jail sentence only to find himself starting a war he can't really finish where he's more the problem than the solution. It's not the deepest of films, but along with The Star Chamber is one of the few to not entirely simplify vigilantism (although it's more of a traditional revenge movie) - here actions have consequences, fathers get their families killed and sons kill their fathers as violence simply escalates.For the first two-thirds of the film director James Wan keeps his inner gorehound under control, delivering one outstanding setpiece with a bravura chase and fight sequence through several streets and several floors of a car park played almost entirely in a single take, which could have been just a case of showing off but here actually lends the scene a real sense of immediacy and desperation without entirely tipping over into unbelievability - the fights are more clumsy and vicious than anything else. Unfortunately it goes more than a bit unlikely in the finale where Bacon suddenly develops enough ability with firearms to take on and beat an entire street gang in graphic detail, while the allegory threatens to get a little too in your face with a shootout in an abandoned mental hospital-cum-crack factory on Stygian Drive (does anyone really name streets after the river to the underworld?). It doesn't help that with Bacon shaving his head and shooting off fingers that the ghost of Travis Bickle is summoned as well, but somehow the film just about gets away with it as a means of making the avenger and the gangster both physically and morally alike. The end result is a film that's never quite as good as it could have been but is certainly a cut above most in its genre: an exploitation flick, perhaps, but not a completely dumb one.",3,The belated real sequel to Death Wish,1287619200,"10 21, 2010",2010,2402,"['Brian', 'Garfield', 'hated', 'what', 'Michael', 'Winner', 'did', 'novel', 'Death', 'Wish', 'so', 'much', 'refused', 'sell', 'screen', 'rights', 'sequel', '2007', 'Death', 'Sentence', 'surprise', 'see', 'reworked', 'version', 'coming', 'director', 'Saw', 'one', 'actually', 'broadly', 'approved', 'even', 'more', 'surprising', 'Paul', 'Kersey-free', 'version', 'least', 'moral', 'complexities', 'being', 'even', 'more', 'heavily', 'changed', 'screen', 'original', 'film', 'time', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'family', 'man', 'take', 'law', 'own', 'hands', 'when', 'gang', 'member', 'who', 'murdered', 'son', 'gang', 'initiation', 'killing', 'only', 'cursory', 'jail', 'sentence', 'only', 'find', 'starting', 'war', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'finish', 'where', 'more', 'problem', 'solution', 'not', 'deepest', 'films', 'Star', 'Chamber', 'one', 'few', 'not', 'entirely', 'simplify', 'vigilantism', 'more', 'traditional', 'revenge', 'movie', 'here', 'actions', 'have', 'consequences', 'fathers', 'get', 'families', 'killed', 'sons', 'kill', 'fathers', 'violence', 'simply', 'escalates.For', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'film', 'director', 'James', 'Wan', 'inner', 'gorehound', 'control', 'delivering', 'one', 'outstanding', 'setpiece', 'bravura', 'chase', 'fight', 'sequence', 'several', 'streets', 'several', 'floors', 'car', 'park', 'played', 'almost', 'entirely', 'single', 'take', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'case', 'showing', 'off', 'here', 'actually', 'scene', 'real', 'sense', 'immediacy', 'desperation', 'entirely', 'tipping', 'over', 'unbelievability', 'fights', 'are', 'more', 'clumsy', 'vicious', 'anything', 'else', 'more', 'bit', 'unlikely', 'finale', 'where', 'Bacon', 'suddenly', 'enough', 'ability', 'firearms', 'take', 'beat', 'entire', 'street', 'gang', 'graphic', 'detail', 'allegory', 'get', 'little', 'too', 'face', 'shootout', 'abandoned', 'mental', 'hospital-cum-crack', 'factory', 'Stygian', 'Drive', 'anyone', 'really', 'name', 'streets', 'river', 'underworld', ""n't"", 'help', 'Bacon', 'shaving', 'head', 'shooting', 'off', 'fingers', 'ghost', 'Travis', 'Bickle', 'summoned', 'as', 'well', 'somehow', 'film', 'just', 'away', 'means', 'making', 'avenger', 'gangster', 'physically', 'morally', 'alike', 'end', 'result', 'film', 'never', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'certainly', 'cut', 'most', 'genre', 'exploitation', 'flick', 'perhaps', 'not', 'completely', 'dumb', 'one']",Death Sentence
