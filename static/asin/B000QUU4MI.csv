1077722,A1GR2QPCD08COG,B000QUU4MI,AlphaDog,"[1, 1]","I recently purchased this two-movies-in-one-package deal because I can't believe how inexpensive DVDs are becoming in the age of instant digital media (right now, not ALL movies are available on demand so I'd rather purchase these two inexpensive flicks for one low price). It's amazing. I'm not much a collector of movies but I do own some flicks that I love watching time and again.My biggest concern was whether these two movies on DVD were true Widescreen and would play correctly on my TV. Many of the reviews here reviewed the movie but not much on the product, that is the DVD itself. High Fidelity worked great on my 1080P HD TV. No problem there. However, the Grosse Point Blank DVD, I had to select a different picture size on the television in order for it to play ""normally"" that is the image isn't stretched out one way or another. If I played the Grosse Point Blank DVD on an analog TV I think it would play just fine and appear like a true widescreen/letterbox format. I've had this problem before with some of my exercise DVDs.For me it's no big deal, even though I wish I didn't have to change the settings on my TV. Aside from this little hiccup, the picture quality is great, the sound is great, the discs were spotless, service was excellent. I don't know what else to say except that High Fidelity plays great on modern HDTVs and Grosse Point Blank didn't quite exactly. It is widescreen but you see that on an analog TV, if this makes any sense.",4,"I'm reviewing the product, not the movie.",1363219200,"03 14, 2013",2013,1467,"['recently', 'purchased', 'two-movies-in-one-package', 'deal', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'inexpensive', 'DVDs', 'are', 'becoming', 'age', 'instant', 'digital', 'media', 'right', 'now', 'not', 'movies', 'are', 'available', 'demand', ""'d"", 'rather', 'purchase', 'two', 'inexpensive', 'flicks', 'one', 'low', 'price', 'amazing', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'collector', 'movies', 'do', 'own', 'flicks', 'love', 'watching', 'time', 'again.My', 'biggest', 'concern', 'was', 'two', 'movies', 'DVD', 'were', 'true', 'Widescreen', 'would', 'play', 'correctly', 'TV', 'Many', 'reviews', 'here', 'reviewed', 'movie', 'not', 'much', 'product', 'DVD', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'worked', 'great', '1080P', 'HD', 'TV', 'problem', 'there', 'However', 'Grosse', 'Point', 'Blank', 'DVD', 'had', 'select', 'different', 'picture', 'size', 'television', 'order', 'play', 'normally', 'image', ""n't"", 'stretched', 'out', 'one', 'way', 'played', 'Grosse', 'Point', 'Blank', 'DVD', 'analog', 'TV', 'think', 'would', 'play', 'just', 'fine', 'appear', 'true', 'widescreen/letterbox', 'format', ""'ve"", 'had', 'problem', 'exercise', 'DVDs.For', 'big', 'deal', 'even', 'wish', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'change', 'settings', 'TV', 'Aside', 'little', 'hiccup', 'picture', 'quality', 'great', 'sound', 'great', 'discs', 'were', 'spotless', 'service', 'was', 'excellent', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'else', 'say', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'great', 'modern', 'HDTVs', 'Grosse', 'Point', 'Blank', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'exactly', 'widescreen', 'see', 'analog', 'TV', 'sense']",Grosse Pointe Blank / High Fidelity

1077728,A3LUV16M4OQSLF,B000QUU4MI,Greg,"[0, 2]","I liked this movie, although I think it was very much to the period (I watched this movie in July 2011 in my early 20's.  The movie came out in 1997).  A lot of the conventions and humor did not resonate as well with me as I had hoped.  I loved the story and am a Huge Piven fan.  I thought he was used well.  I also thought Cusack was  good pick for the role.  The genre is weird...it is like a drama-comedy, much more common today I feel.I did think the movie needed some cutting.  It was a bit long, but I liked the overall idea.  I think with some cutting, some rewrites and reshotting today the movie could be a monster comedy hit.(which I may chalk up the movie not playing as well years after it came out as the genre has been developed more)In the end, if you a movie person I would recommend it.  This Original Idea is refreshing amongst an movie scene of mostly stupid or unoriginal ideas.  A remake of this movie with aWedding Crashers (Rated),Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy [Blu-ray] orSuperbadfeel behind it could be a monster comedic/dramatic hit in my eyes.If you are looking for something different, like any of the cast or original stories, ideas, jokes or dialogue this movie is for you.Packaging note:The Discs come as two separate discs, and I bought the pack because this was cheaper than just buying Grosse Pointe Blank at the time.",3,"Good movie, out of it's element a little in 2011",1312416000,"08 4, 2011",2011,1361,"['liked', 'movie', 'think', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'period', 'watched', 'movie', 'July', '2011', 'early', '20', 'movie', 'came', 'out', '1997', 'lot', 'conventions', 'humor', 'did', 'not', 'resonate', 'as', 'well', 'had', 'hoped', 'loved', 'story', 'am', 'Huge', 'Piven', 'fan', 'thought', 'was', 'used', 'well', 'also', 'thought', 'Cusack', 'was', 'good', 'pick', 'role', 'genre', 'weird', 'drama-comedy', 'much', 'more', 'common', 'today', 'feel.I', 'did', 'think', 'movie', 'needed', 'cutting', 'was', 'bit', 'long', 'liked', 'overall', 'idea', 'think', 'cutting', 'rewrites', 'reshotting', 'today', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'monster', 'comedy', 'hit', 'may', 'chalk', 'up', 'movie', 'not', 'playing', 'as', 'well', 'years', 'came', 'out', 'genre', 'been', 'developed', 'more', 'end', 'movie', 'person', 'would', 'recommend', 'Original', 'Idea', 'refreshing', 'amongst', 'movie', 'scene', 'mostly', 'stupid', 'unoriginal', 'ideas', 'remake', 'movie', 'aWedding', 'Crashers', 'Rated', 'Anchorman', 'Legend', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'orSuperbadfeel', 'behind', 'could', 'be', 'monster', 'comedic/dramatic', 'hit', 'eyes.If', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'different', 'cast', 'original', 'stories', 'ideas', 'jokes', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'you.Packaging', 'note', 'Discs', 'come', 'two', 'separate', 'discs', 'bought', 'pack', 'was', 'cheaper', 'just', 'buying', 'Grosse', 'Pointe', 'Blank', 'time']",Grosse Pointe Blank / High Fidelity
