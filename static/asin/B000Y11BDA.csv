Our family has watched it quite a few times and have laughed as much the last time as the first.

1115856,A25VN8IR9DYJK3,B000Y11BDA,Karl E. Hopkins-lutz,"[0, 0]","Something to bear in mind is that in the original production of each film was actually reversed in order. So internationally, these films are Armour of God, and Armour of God 2 - Operation Condor. Chan's character is very much the same character though, a tomb raider, but in many ways the story of Operation Condor feels inspired by those of Indiana Jones.Condor features brief nudity and some sexual humor, but is a cute romp. The women are gorgeous, and the bad guys range from the evil to the hilarious.",5,"Two fun, action-packed movies worth watching",1363910400,"03 22, 2013",2013,507,"['Something', 'bear', 'mind', 'original', 'production', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'reversed', 'order', 'So', 'internationally', 'films', 'are', 'Armour', 'God', 'Armour', 'God', '2', 'Operation', 'Condor', 'Chan', 'character', 'very', 'much', 'same', 'character', 'tomb', 'raider', 'many', 'ways', 'story', 'Operation', 'Condor', 'feels', 'inspired', 'Indiana', 'Jones.Condor', 'brief', 'nudity', 'sexual', 'humor', 'cute', 'romp', 'women', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'bad', 'guys', 'range', 'evil', 'hilarious']",N/A

1115858,A26VVFUGD73FSO,B000Y11BDA,S.,"[0, 0]","First of all, I'm a big fan of these movies, I watched OC 2 like 30 times since I was a kid.I started the Operation Condor 2 DVD, the picture was 1/2 of screen. I needed to re-size it on my computer with my Media Player settings. So the quality of the picture is off, if you don't have settings in your DVD player, you can't watch the movie full screen. (I cannot, when I tried another media player on my computer.)It's because the copyright warning and the menu is 4:3, but the movie is 16:9, so the computer's media players can't handle it.The subtitles doesn't work with the Media Player I use. So I can choose between watching the movie full screen without subtitles, or 1/2 screen with subtitles.The 3rd problem is the worst. I don't mind the video quality that much, I speak English so I understand everything, but the music. What is happened to the awesome original soundtrack? The original music is so intense, so awesome, so fitting, funny, cool, but on this version of DVD release the company changed it to a really cheap and boring music. I'm really disappointed, If I'd have known they took the music off and they changed it to this, I'd buy a different version. I don't care about the picture quality, the subtitles, the bad English dubbing, but the music just horrible...For example, they original one has funny music during the funnies scene in the movie. For some reason this DVD release has weird/scary music during that scene.(It's like watching the famour Rocky tranining montage scene with a Britney Spears song instead of &#34;Hearts on Fire&#34;.)The French version has the original music. I watched the German release, it has the great original music.The US version has this really boring music. It's ruined the movie for me.I didn't check the DVD #1 yet, but I bougth the set for the 2nd movie, so It doesn't matter, really.",2,There are multiple problems with this version,1368316800,"05 12, 2013",2013,1848,"['First', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'movies', 'watched', 'OC', '2', '30', 'times', 'was', 'kid.I', 'started', 'Operation', 'Condor', '2', 'DVD', 'picture', 'was', '1/2', 'screen', 'needed', 're-size', 'computer', 'Media', 'Player', 'settings', 'quality', 'picture', 'off', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'settings', 'DVD', 'player', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie', 'full', 'screen', 'can', 'not', 'when', 'tried', 'media', 'player', 'computer', 'copyright', 'warning', 'menu', '4:3', 'movie', '16:9', 'so', 'computer', 'media', 'players', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'it.The', 'subtitles', ""n't"", 'work', 'Media', 'Player', 'use', 'can', 'choose', 'watching', 'movie', 'full', 'screen', 'subtitles', '1/2', 'screen', 'subtitles.The', '3rd', 'problem', 'worst', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'video', 'quality', 'much', 'speak', 'English', 'understand', 'everything', 'music', 'What', 'happened', 'awesome', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'original', 'music', 'so', 'intense', 'so', 'awesome', 'so', 'fitting', 'funny', 'cool', 'version', 'DVD', 'release', 'company', 'changed', 'really', 'cheap', 'boring', 'music', ""'m"", 'really', 'disappointed', ""'d"", 'have', 'known', 'took', 'music', 'changed', ""'d"", 'buy', 'different', 'version', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'picture', 'quality', 'subtitles', 'bad', 'English', 'dubbing', 'music', 'just', 'horrible', 'example', 'original', 'one', 'funny', 'music', 'funnies', 'scene', 'movie', 'reason', 'DVD', 'release', 'weird/scary', 'music', 'scene', 'watching', 'famour', 'Rocky', 'tranining', 'montage', 'scene', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'song', 'instead', '34', 'Hearts', 'Fire', '34', 'French', 'version', 'original', 'music', 'watched', 'German', 'release', 'great', 'original', 'music.The', 'US', 'version', 'really', 'boring', 'music', 'ruined', 'movie', 'me.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'check', 'DVD', '1', 'yet', 'bougth', 'set', '2nd', 'movie', ""n't"", 'matter', 'really']",N/A
