My husband and I watched it with our kids as well and we all loved it!  We like to expose the kids to movies that have at least some educational content and Sid made this one a home run!  Since this movie mainly takes place in a science museum, there is a great spread of facts given on multiple subjects.  This is a great PBS kids movie that I suggest you add to your collection today.",5,GREAT movie!

This month I received Sid the Science Kid The Movie on DVD to watch and review. With our crazy schedules, we hadn't been able to watch it until tonight. First of all, let me say this: Micah (3) will NOT watch something unless it is one of his very few favorites (one of which is an NCircle dvd, Mighty Machines&#65279;). He sat and watched the entire DVD of Sid the Science Kid!Of course, with four kids (10, 8, 6, and 3) I get stuck watching a LOT of kids shows. Sid the Science Kid is one that I don't mind as much, because it is educational. I enjoyed watching Sid the Science Kid the Movie! It was really funny. There were parts that had me laughing out loud. I really enjoyed that it showed how even little kids can make a difference in trying to solve a problem. Heaven (10) mentioned that she really liked it, but wished there was some more action. Just a few minutes later there was a bit more action added in. That perked her up! All five of us enjoyed watching the movie, and I'm sure it will get watched many more times.",5,Lots of Science Fun for the Whole Family!,1363996800,"03 23, 2013",2013,1118,"['have', 'had', 'awesome', 'opportunity', 'be', 'iNsider', 'NCircle', 'Entertainment', '65279', 'month', 'received', 'Sid', 'Science', 'Kid', 'Movie', 'DVD', 'watch', 'review', 'crazy', 'schedules', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'watch', 'tonight', 'First', 'let', 'say', 'Micah', '3', 'will', 'NOT', 'watch', 'something', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'favorites', 'one', 'NCircle', 'dvd', 'Mighty', 'Machines', '65279', 'sat', 'watched', 'entire', 'DVD', 'Sid', 'Science', 'Kid', 'course', 'four', 'kids', '10', '8', '6', '3', 'get', 'stuck', 'watching', 'LOT', 'kids', 'shows', 'Sid', 'Science', 'Kid', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'as', 'much', 'educational', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Sid', 'Science', 'Kid', 'Movie', 'was', 'really', 'funny', 'were', 'parts', 'had', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'showed', 'how', 'even', 'little', 'kids', 'can', 'make', 'difference', 'trying', 'solve', 'problem', 'Heaven', '10', 'mentioned', 'really', 'liked', 'wished', 'was', 'more', 'action', 'Just', 'few', 'minutes', 'later', 'was', 'bit', 'more', 'action', 'added', 'perked', 'up', 'five', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'get', 'watched', 'many', 'more', 'times']",Sid the Science Kid: Sid the Movie
1613279,A1IY1UDG9BNQXF,B00AMA8GH2,NB83,"[0, 0]","Sid the Science Kid: The Movie takes you and your kids through the soon-to-open Super Ultimate Science Museum along with Sid, Gabriella and two new friends from China. After winning a science contest that gives them an advance tour of the museum, the kids go on a fun journey with a very artificially intelligent robot named Bobby Bot. However, when one of the exhibits causes Bobby Bot's circuit board to crash, the kids try to fix him. The result of their efforts is a hilarious haywire robot! Kids get a sampling of some scientific knowledge presented to them that will spur conversations to dive deeper into certain areas of interest. Kids learn about bees in a larger than life beehive exhibit, simple machines like pulleys and levers, dinosaurs in the prehistoric exhibit, the definition of astronomy and even the concept of probability is introduced. This movie serves as a great springboard for discussion of different scientific concepts, but also as a comical movie to enjoy with your kids. My 6 year old said his favorite part of the movie was the singing T-Rex, and my 5 year old enjoyed watching Bobby Bot's silly antics when he went haywire. I was impressed by how fun this movie was for kids while still providing a great educational experience. With a runtime of 75 minutes, it was just the right length. When asked how they would rate the movie, they gave it a whopping 10 out of 10! Thanks, NCircle! Keep up the great work!",5,Lots of Museum Fun!,1363305600,"03 15, 2013",2013,1441,"['Sid', 'Science', 'Kid', 'Movie', 'kids', 'soon-to-open', 'Super', 'Ultimate', 'Science', 'Museum', 'Sid', 'Gabriella', 'two', 'new', 'friends', 'China', 'winning', 'science', 'contest', 'advance', 'tour', 'museum', 'kids', 'go', 'fun', 'journey', 'very', 'artificially', 'intelligent', 'robot', 'named', 'Bobby', 'Bot', 'However', 'when', 'one', 'exhibits', 'Bobby', 'Bot', 'circuit', 'board', 'crash', 'kids', 'try', 'fix', 'result', 'efforts', 'hilarious', 'haywire', 'robot', 'Kids', 'get', 'sampling', 'scientific', 'knowledge', 'presented', 'will', 'spur', 'conversations', 'dive', 'deeper', 'certain', 'areas', 'interest', 'Kids', 'learn', 'bees', 'larger', 'life', 'beehive', 'exhibit', 'simple', 'machines', 'pulleys', 'levers', 'dinosaurs', 'prehistoric', 'exhibit', 'definition', 'astronomy', 'even', 'concept', 'probability', 'introduced', 'movie', 'great', 'springboard', 'discussion', 'different', 'scientific', 'concepts', 'also', 'comical', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'kids', '6', 'year', 'old', 'said', 'favorite', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'singing', 'T-Rex', '5', 'year', 'old', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Bobby', 'Bot', 'silly', 'antics', 'when', 'went', 'haywire', 'was', 'impressed', 'how', 'fun', 'movie', 'was', 'kids', 'still', 'providing', 'great', 'educational', 'experience', 'runtime', '75', 'minutes', 'was', 'just', 'right', 'length', 'When', 'asked', 'how', 'would', 'rate', 'movie', 'gave', 'whopping', '10', '10', 'Thanks', 'NCircle', 'Keep', 'great', 'work']",Sid the Science Kid: Sid the Movie

She loves being with her brothers but the movie is colorful with some of the voices being excited and higher pitched.I was with them for a week and we watched at least 3 times and that was more than they are really allowed to watch TV. It has robots and the newer ways of doing things then mentions leverage, pulleys.

While we are very familiar with some of the NCircle brands, Sid the Science Kid was a new one for us so we were very excited to see what Sid was all about. Our first impression was that the movie was good and we loved Sid and friends, but as the movie went on and they went to the museum it became so much more. The museum really comes to life and gives the children a nice balance of fun and education. They cover an array of topics as they go through the museum leaving little tidbits of knowledge for the children all while tossing in lots of cute jokes and a robot gone haywire, oh and did I mention Christopher Lloyd? My 3 year old really enjoyed watching this movie, but I think anyone of any age could appreciate it. We look forward to seeing more of Sid and are excited to add him to our favorites.",5,Sid the Science Kid: Sid the Movie,1364083200,"03 24, 2013",2013,950,"['were', 'recently', 'sent', 'complimentary', 'copy', 'Sid', 'Science', 'Kid', 'Sid', 'Movie', 'NCircle', 'Entertainment', 'part', 'iNSider', 'program', 'are', 'very', 'familiar', 'NCircle', 'brands', 'Sid', 'Science', 'Kid', 'was', 'new', 'one', 'were', 'very', 'excited', 'see', 'what', 'Sid', 'was', 'first', 'impression', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'loved', 'Sid', 'friends', 'movie', 'went', 'went', 'museum', 'became', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'museum', 'really', 'life', 'children', 'nice', 'balance', 'fun', 'education', 'cover', 'array', 'topics', 'go', 'museum', 'leaving', 'little', 'tidbits', 'knowledge', 'children', 'tossing', 'lots', 'cute', 'jokes', 'robot', 'gone', 'haywire', 'oh', 'did', 'mention', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', '3', 'year', 'old', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'movie', 'think', 'anyone', 'age', 'could', 'appreciate', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'more', 'Sid', 'are', 'excited', 'add', 'favorites']",Sid the Science Kid: Sid the Movie
1613282,A30X9M0J5WOVAS,B00AMA8GH2,The IEMommy,"[0, 0]","The first time my kids watched Sid the Science Kid The Movie I was in the other room and all I kept hearing was Reed laughing really hard! Reed is like me, we don't laugh out loud unless we find something really funny. We are a tough crowd so I knew we had a winner before I even watched it.When I asked Reed what was so funny he said when they touched the robot's control panel he turned into different kinds of machines. I had to see it for myself so I joined them the next time (which by the way, was immediately following the first time they watched it).This movie, as all Sid the Science Kid shows, is so educational! He and Gabriela win a trip to a museum which is the perfect learning environment. It is full of facts on things like astronomy, weather, dinosaurs, and my sons favorite: machines. It was even entertaining for me to watch and I found myself laughing along with Reed.I love that it is just one hour long which is the ideal length in my opinion. TV shows are 20 minutes when you take out the commercials and most kids movies are around an hour and a half. This one isn't too long or too short; it's just right!Sid the Science kid The Movie was a huge hit in my house with both of my kids. I love it when they want to watch the same show so there's no fight over whose turn it is.
