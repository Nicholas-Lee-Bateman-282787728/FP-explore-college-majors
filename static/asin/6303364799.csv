They have so much going on at one time it gets hard to follow and at times it get's confusing.  And instead of deeloping their characters so the viewer can feel as if he/she ""knows"" this person...they go to one battle scene to another where Parn believes just because his father was a great knight he automatically knows how to use a sword.  I mean for peats sake....Deedlit is a better fighter than him! And she's the one that gets captured at the end!This entire series was a total let down for me and i would advise against buying it.  If you have a friend whom owns it i would suggest you borrow it and watch it from them first before you buy it....or at least read some more of these reviews.",3,Not what i was expecting,1102032000,"12 3, 2004",2004,1216,"['chanced', 'DVD', 'collection', 'video', 'store', 'having', 'read', 'manga', 'associated', 'i', 'decided', 'not', 'wise', 'choice.For', 'thirteen', 'episodes', '30', 'minutes', 'length', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'pass', 'quickly', 'fact', 'darn', 'plot', 'moved', 'so', 'slowly', 'feel', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'ages.While', 'trying', 'survive', 'Parn', 'nievity', 'be', 'very', 'annoying', 'time', 'find', 'trying', 'stay', 'awake', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'heck', 'main', 'plot', 'about', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'one', 'time', 'hard', 'follow', 'times', 'get', 'confusing', 'instead', 'deeloping', 'characters', 'viewer', 'can', 'feel', 'he/she', 'knows', 'person', 'go', 'one', 'battle', 'scene', 'where', 'Parn', 'just', 'father', 'was', 'great', 'knight', 'automatically', 'how', 'use', 'sword', 'mean', 'peats', 'sake', '.Deedlit', 'better', 'fighter', 'one', 'captured', 'end', 'entire', 'series', 'was', 'total', 'let', 'down', 'i', 'would', 'advise', 'buying', 'have', 'friend', 'whom', 'i', 'would', 'suggest', 'borrow', 'watch', 'first', 'buy', 'least', 'read', 'more', 'reviews']",N/A

Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[7, 7]","Like Bubblegum Crisis for cyberpunk, and Vampire Hunter D for horror, and Ghost in the Shell for sci-fi, Record of Lodoss War, the original OVA, was and is the best in its genre. It's created the formula all fantasy series have used over the years, and duplications of Lodoss War are, not surprisingly, successful (Berserk is one example).As the title suggests, this OVA is a series of stories following the same characters as they battle in a war to save the cursed islands of Lodoss from many evil forces, including wizards, witches, a dark elf, monsters, and dragons. Though small in size, the group of companions are large in compassion and confidence, and they battle these forces to the best of their powers, even if it means death. Though the story is cliche in today's world, so is Lord of the Rings. I'd go as far as to say that Lodoss War did for anime was LotR did for literature. The heroes are stereotypical (a fighter, a mysterious elf, a thief, a dwarf, a wizard, and a priest) and the enemies rehashed (goblins and dragons) yet it just works here because Lodoss was the first to truly attempt something the big. Without this anime, many later anime would never have been created.Though the story bounces around some, it mostly follows the young fighter Parn as he meets those who he comes to not only trust, but love as well. And all along the way, he slowly learns the skills needed to become a legend among heroes. During his journey, he battles many powerful enemies, including a huge dragon, and always seems to come out ahead. He becomes the purest picture of altruism and is willing to sacrifice himself for those around him.And history tells us that many believe this a good series, what with numerous spin-off series and movies, and many almost direct copies. If you are a fan of anime and want to see one of the important anime, then pick this up.",5,The Original Fantasy Classic,1137542400,"01 18, 2006",2006,1872,"['Bubblegum', 'Crisis', 'cyberpunk', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', 'D', 'horror', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'sci-fi', 'Record', 'Lodoss', 'War', 'original', 'OVA', 'was', 'best', 'genre', 'created', 'formula', 'fantasy', 'series', 'have', 'used', 'years', 'duplications', 'Lodoss', 'War', 'are', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'successful', 'Berserk', 'one', 'example', 'title', 'OVA', 'series', 'stories', 'following', 'same', 'characters', 'battle', 'war', 'save', 'cursed', 'islands', 'Lodoss', 'many', 'evil', 'forces', 'including', 'wizards', 'witches', 'dark', 'elf', 'monsters', 'dragons', 'small', 'size', 'group', 'companions', 'are', 'large', 'compassion', 'confidence', 'battle', 'forces', 'best', 'powers', 'even', 'death', 'story', 'cliche', 'today', 'world', 'so', 'Lord', 'Rings', ""'d"", 'go', 'as', 'far', 'say', 'Lodoss', 'War', 'did', 'anime', 'was', 'LotR', 'did', 'literature', 'heroes', 'are', 'stereotypical', 'fighter', 'mysterious', 'elf', 'thief', 'dwarf', 'wizard', 'priest', 'enemies', 'rehashed', 'goblins', 'dragons', 'yet', 'just', 'here', 'Lodoss', 'was', 'first', 'truly', 'attempt', 'something', 'big', 'anime', 'many', 'later', 'anime', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'story', 'bounces', 'mostly', 'young', 'fighter', 'Parn', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'trust', 'as', 'well', 'way', 'slowly', 'skills', 'needed', 'become', 'legend', 'heroes', 'journey', 'many', 'powerful', 'enemies', 'including', 'huge', 'dragon', 'always', 'come', 'out', 'ahead', 'purest', 'picture', 'altruism', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'him.And', 'history', 'tells', 'many', 'believe', 'good', 'series', 'what', 'numerous', 'spin-off', 'series', 'movies', 'many', 'almost', 'direct', 'copies', 'are', 'fan', 'anime', 'want', 'see', 'one', 'important', 'anime', 'then', 'pick', 'up']",N/A

The result is  that the first episode of the series actually takes place three or four  episodes into the story.

First, the idea of a sorceress controlling peoples' lives in order to create a war that will 'save Lodoss' is very original in my opinion.  The story is wonderful and complex and I think it is a joy to watch again and again.  The characters are well thought out and you even begin to sympathize with them. I'll admit that a lot of the character and plot ideas originate from Dungeons and Dragons, but it is played out in an original way.(You can read many other reviews for all the plot and events)Basically the with Karla decides that the balance of power must be restored in Lodoss so that the world is not destroyed.  In order to accomplish this, the witch instigates the war that is already beginning to develop.  Beld and Fahn, the two opposing Kings engage each other with Parn and his companions caught up in the struggle.On the second disc, events do get bogged down after Karla is defeated and moves on to her new body.  Finally things pick up when Ashram and Parn engage each other in Demon Dragon Mountain.  Both the Japanese and the English Dub are wonderful.  I prefer most anime in Japanese, but this is one that I prefer in English (along with IRIA Zeiram).I would say that for fans of any RPGs or Lord of the Rings this is a great boxed set to pick up.  You may be able to find it to rent (usually you can rent both discs in one box, sometimes you have to rent them separately).Just remember that this is an anime developed in the EIGHTIES and drawn right around 1990.  The animation is great for being almost 15 years old.I encourage everyone to just watch it and decide for themselves.

Tragic after the great sword play in the original  Lodoss.Next on my list is the child like anime recap at the end of every  episode. At first I really liked these, but after watching the first few  tapes, this got old, and was just stealing time from the real story.A  personal let down is the fact that Parn and the gang have little to no part  in this. They start the story, and quickly hand the story over to a new  band of adventures. While this may not be a bad thing to some, I was  looking forward to more of the saga of Parn and company.Had this been a  stand alone story and not connected in anyway, I might have enjoyed it as a  lesser copy or rip off.

I was very much looking forward to seeing it given its outstanding reputation, but after doing so...well, whether the set was worth fifty bucks seems highly debatable.Let's ignore the fact that somebody involved in the production of this series was obviously a reeeeeeally big fan of the Dragonlance Chronicles.  After all, that series is something of a fantasy classic; that Lodoss War shamelessly rips off large segments of the DLC story would not make it a bad thing--as long as it was entertaining.And that's the kicker: LW just isn't very much fun to watch.  Characters in anime don't have to be hugely deep to be likable, but most of the ones here are just blank slates who never really make up in charm what they lack in depth.  There are exceptions (Slayn, who looked cool enough to render any criticism moot; the berserker and his paramour; some of the villains), but it's really not enough, especially when there's something of an air of pointlessness about the whole story, culminating in a confused mess of an ending consisting largely of pointless combat with no real relevance to anything.As far as fantasy anime goes, I'm sticking with Slayers, and that's my final answer. Lodoss War isn't wholly without merit, but in the end, anyone wanting more serious fare would do better to pick up copies of the DL Chronicles--more entertaining, and a helluva lot cheaper.",2,Bafflingly overrated,996710400,"08 2, 2001",2001,1547,"['hate', 'go', 'flow', 'did', 'sound', 'convincing', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'share', 'general', 'enthusiasm', 'Lodoss', 'War', 'elicit', 'amongst', 'most', 'viewers', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'given', 'outstanding', 'reputation', 'doing', 'so', 'well', 'set', 'was', 'worth', 'fifty', 'bucks', 'highly', 'debatable.Let', 'ignore', 'fact', 'somebody', 'involved', 'production', 'series', 'was', 'obviously', 'reeeeeeally', 'big', 'fan', 'Dragonlance', 'Chronicles', 'series', 'something', 'fantasy', 'classic', 'Lodoss', 'War', 'shamelessly', 'large', 'segments', 'DLC', 'story', 'would', 'not', 'make', 'bad', 'thing', 'as', 'long', 'was', 'kicker', 'LW', 'just', ""n't"", 'very', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'Characters', 'anime', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'hugely', 'deep', 'be', 'likable', 'most', 'ones', 'here', 'are', 'just', 'blank', 'slates', 'who', 'never', 'really', 'make', 'up', 'charm', 'what', 'lack', 'depth', 'are', 'exceptions', 'Slayn', 'who', 'looked', 'cool', 'enough', 'render', 'criticism', 'moot', 'berserker', 'paramour', 'villains', 'really', 'not', 'enough', 'especially', 'when', 'something', 'air', 'pointlessness', 'whole', 'story', 'culminating', 'confused', 'mess', 'ending', 'consisting', 'largely', 'pointless', 'combat', 'real', 'relevance', 'anything.As', 'far', 'fantasy', 'anime', ""'m"", 'sticking', 'Slayers', 'final', 'answer', 'Lodoss', 'War', ""n't"", 'wholly', 'merit', 'end', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'more', 'serious', 'fare', 'would', 'do', 'better', 'pick', 'up', 'copies', 'DL', 'Chronicles', 'more', 'entertaining', 'helluva', 'lot', 'cheaper']",N/A

The heavens shook as the armies of Falis, God of Light, clashed with those of Falaris, God of Darkness. In the unceasing battle which followed, the earth wept...  The seas boiled...At last, only two survivors remained of both sides.  Marfa, Goddess of Creation, and Kardis, Goddess of Destruction, who met in  a clash which echoed to the ends of the earth. At the end of the fierce  battle, a new land was born, split off from the continent, and the life's  fires of the goddesses of Light and Dark flickered and died  away.Thousands of years have since passed. And now, the land to the  south of the continent of Alecrast has become known as &quot;Lodoss - The  Accursed Island.&quot;I was expecting quite a bit out of Lodoss war. I  was very dissapointed. Some of the reviews that I read said that  &quot;Record of Lodoss War&quot; is a wonderful anime with majestic  characters,involving plot, and eye catching animation. Unfortunatly, some  of this is untrue.The animation was very detailed, very much so in the  first couple episodes. The frame rates were excellent,and the character  designs were superb. I was somewhat dissapointed with the battles,  however.From one review,It was said that the legthly battle sequences were  some of the best. Not so. The majority of the battles may have lasted a  while,But fast paced they are not. The only battle that had my puse racing  was the berserker battle. Other than that, I found that many battles  consisted of excessive camera panning, which started happening more and  more as the series progressed. I also witnessed the overuse of certain  images. It sort of gave me a feeling of Deja vu. As the series  progressed,the animation started to lose detail. In fact,I found some of  the monsters in volumn 6 to be Hokey,and very poor.The characters may  have been this animes saving grace. You'll fall in love with them. Despite  Parns constant frusteration and how ignorant  he was of Deedlits attraction  toward him until it was to late, He still came off to be a likeable guy.  Deedlit herelf was a good character. Deedlit had a certain mysterious  quality about her, and also was sesitive. The bad guys too, are well done.  These are the kind of guys you'll love to hate.I found the plot to be  masterful, with lots of cool twists and turns. I did find it to be a  entertaining fantasy,But the weak ending droned on and on.The final  verdict is if you like fantasy anime, epic quests, or are a fan of &quot;RG  Veda&quot;, or &quot;the Vision Of Escaflown&quot;, or love elven vixens  dressed in revealing outfits,  I'm sure you'll love this.

370781,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,6303364799,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[7, 7]","Okay, I'm gonna start off with a personal note:  RECORD OF LODOSS WAR is probably one of my all-time favorite series ever.  At the time that I was just getting warmed up to Anime (thanks to witnessing Miyazaki's wonderful artistry), I happened upon this title in my local videostore.  Instantly, I fell in love with this thirteen-part direct-to-video series -- being a fan of the SNES game FINAL FANTASY III and J.R.R. Tolkien in general, watching RECORD OF LODOSS WAR was like a dream come true.  It's a hybrid of these two great works filled with just about everything any fan could ask for -- dragons, elves, dark gods, a band of unlikely yet loyal heroes, villains you'll love to hate, action, suspense, romance, a small touch of humor, and engaging from start to finish.The story is hardly original, but it's done very well for this kind of show.  In fact, the one minor flaw of this series is the way the plot &quot;jumps around&quot; from one event to the next.  However, it's the characters which make RECORD OF LODOSS WAR so much fun, and much of the best scenes belong to Parn and Deedlit; especially the dance sequence.  Ghim and Deed also get to bicker about each other's differences while Parn, on a quest to clear his disgraced father's name, finds a father figure in Kashue.  Ashram has a Dark Elf named Pirotess (the opposite of Deedlit) who'll do anything to prove her loyalty to him... including sacrificing herself, Karla is shifty and cunning, while Wagnard is just plain evil -- an over-the-top, maniacal monster equivalent of Kefka from FF III who cackles fiendishly as he puts his dark plans into action.  The chemistry between this cast of characters is so well done and the show is so engrossing that it's easy to forgive its occasional shortcomings, notably the jumpy plotting and the animation, which, although gorgeously drawn, uses a low cel count which results with some stiff movements.  It may take a while for one to warm up to the music, but by the end, it really grows on you.  For fantasy buffs, RECORD OF LODOSS WAR is simply great fun.Central Park Media made a DVD release of this title a few years ago, but have since rereleased it in a more beefed up package, with some new bonus features to speak of, including the behind-the-scenes featurette we saw on the VHS tapes as well as a Promotional video (dubbed in English), which sounds, I'm sad to say, awful.  There's even some DVD-ROM features (identical to those on the CHRONICLES set), including the dub script and credits for both casts.  As far as I'm concerned, the visual transfer is very well done, but then I've never seen the old release so I can't compare it with that.  (I was told, though, that CPM used a new Digital Video Remastering process to clean up the visuals for this release.)For purists, the Japanese language track is on here with clear, easy to read subtitles, and an optional English dub.  Considering that it was recorded at a time when dubs had a very bad reputation, this English production is surprisingly good.  It got somewhat mixed reviews; some say it's fake and/or mediocre while others find it annoying, but here's a better review from one of its many enthusiastic fans (that's me!).  No, it's not perfect, and some lines do come off as a bit awkward, but a lot of the voiceovers are really good.  In particular, Billy Regan (Parn), Lisa Ortiz (Deedlit), Al Muscari (Slayn), Jacques Le Can (Woodchuck), Simone Grant (Karla &amp; Leylia), John Knox (Ashram), Jayce Reeves (deliciously malevolent as Wagnard), and Alexander J. Rose (Wort and the Narrator), are among my favorites.  Plus, the dialogue is close to the subtitled script and packed with some memorable one-liners (Parn: &quot;Quick, Deed, what's [the dragon]'s weak spot?&quot; Deedlit: &quot;I'm not a dragon expert! How should I know?!&quot;) and great chemistry between the actors.  I especially loved the interactions between Parn and Deedlit, the banter between Ghim and Deed, and a lot of other things.  Which is why it saddens me that some would find all of this &quot;inferior&quot; to the Japanese language track.  I listened to parts of the Japanese language track, too, and while I did find it to be of top-quality, I find that the dub still holds its own position decently.

Of course that series was Record of Lodoss War.  I bought the DVDs not long after and decided to watch the episodes two a day, because it was too long for one sitting.It started out in the middle of the journey to find Wort, but I was immediately impressed by the narration and storyline.  The animation was also much better than I was expecting, though it is not good compared to some of the art out today.  I was a little confused, at first, by the complex and intermittent plot line, but that was soon overcome and I followed the story without much difficulty. The characters were the best part of the series, because it had so many memorable characters, mainly Parn and Deedlit, that really strengthened the plot and gave an added depth to the whole of the movie.  The movie also has it share of action and fight scenes that were performed well and were never boring.From romance to good vs. evil conflicts, this series has it all.  And is recommended to all who share a love for epic adventures.

370785,A2O0CFU9Q9XK3,6303364799,"""madnessmark""","[6, 6]","Record of Lodoss War is a fantasy anime adapted by the books in Japan. The main goal with this series was to stay true to the RPG style and I think they did a good of it with this 13 episode OVA. The story takes off right in the middle of six heros (Parn, Slayn, Ghim, Etoh, Wood and Deed) wandering through a tunnel system and fighting a dragon. If this is confusing, episode 2 and 3 explain a lot as they tell from the begining of the story. The first disc is what I like to call the Clash of Heroes saga as it tells of the battle between Beld and Fahn, two rulers which control different parts of Lodoss. The second disc takes off as the ressurection of a god who could destory all of Lodoss. A lot of dragons come into play in the second disc and the battle between them are beautiful. One of the best things Lodoss has going for it is its supreme artwork and the ability to confuse the audiance with its complex storytelling. In terms of video quality, there is a lot of noticable grain in epsidoe 2, but after that its fine. The video is of the dubbed version which means you means you are going to be stuck with the English vocie cast in the credits. That really doesn't matter much as some of the voice actors from the saga are named in the documentary. Oh yeah, thats another thing. Theres only one &quot;extras&quot;. The making of documentary which was included on the VHS tapes is actually really just a viewing of the Lodoss premiere at a theater. Still, even with boring menus and little extras, Record of Lodoss War is still with worth buying. Subtitles are bold and easy to read and no detection of screw ups in the audio department. And being half of what the boxed set costs, this is an easy buy.

There is a certain infectious delight in assembling a crew of somewhat unlikely heroes and going on a layered series of quests that eventually saves the world (and the pretty significant other as well).  It gives us a change to use our imaginations, our luck, and to try out different personalities in harsh, magical worlds.  And that is what 'The Record of Lodoss War' is really about.Based on an original manga series.  The story starts with six companions.  Parn, a compulsive do-gooder (and negligible swordsman), Etoh the priest to be,  Deedlit the beautiful high elf,  Woodchuck the thief, Ghim the dwarf, and Slayn the mage.  Beld, the evil king of Marmo is invading Lodoss, and Parn and his friends are dedicated to stopping the threat.  Throw in a few more kings, some dragons, a witch, swords, chalices... you name it.  If you like fantasy, there has to be something here to draw you in.The scale of the story is probably major overkill.  As it is, character development is a bit squished by all the action.  Relationships that could have become very interesting on their own keep being truncated by the sudden appearance of yet another avatar of evil.  In fact, the viewer occasionally has the feeling that an entire scene has died on the cutting room floor in an effort to keep everything moving forward.  I did find this a bit frustrating, but the truth is that this is supposed to be an action adventure story, not something with Evangelion's twists and turns.The animation is primitive, mostly consisting of foreground action panned against a static background.  There is also a tendency to overuse certain scenes.  However, the artistic quality is excellent, as a tour of the DVD's art gallery will quickly reveal.  There are lots of fantasy settings, armor, clothing, and a set of totally incredible dragons.  Music is acceptable as well.  One has to keep in mind that viewing 13 episodes in rapid sequence will reveal some irritating repetitions what would be hard to spot in normal pacing.  The Japanese acting and vocal choices are better than the English equivalents, but the translation itself is excellent.  The transfer to DVD could have been better.This is worth watching.  It's very easy to nitpick, but the truth is that very few long anime fantasy series are as strong as 'The Record of Lodoss Wars.'  There is always room for something better, but I am glad this is as good as it is.

Some may complain that Parn's a wimp who anyone can beat, but I liked that he doesn't immediatedly turn into an invincible superhero. This series had me smiling, gasping in excitement to see what happens. I watched it all in one go, although before I never had even read the manga or seen one episode.There's of course some minor things, a pixellated scene here, low audio there, a plot device not fully worked out, but that's all minor things. The thing is, this series is something for anyone who enjoys a good clash between good and evil and where the hero gets the heroine in the end, especially if you like heroic fantasy.Something about the packaging. It comes in a sturdy cardboard box with the 2 dvds in cardboard/plastic cases, not sure of the name. But I wish they'd used standard dvd keepcases instead, because they're much sturdier. Still, they're nearly the same size, I just keep them in the box. The art on the box is about what you expect, scenes from the series, but the quality is so-so.

Thankfully the original thirteen episodes are well produced and remain a series with an interesting plot and well  developed characters. The animation isn't up to the standard of Manga,  although it is certainly watchable especially in the DVD format. The series  is perhaps best thought of as Dungeons &amp; Dragons on video. There are  plenty of exotic monsters and the episodes keep the exitement factor high.

Parn is determined to salvage his family's name. Then one day Parn saves a young woman who is attacked by a gang of goblins in the woods. That goblins should be out in broad daylight is very strange, since they normally only come out at night. Later the other villagers berate him for killing a goblin, since they're certain more will come and retaliate by attacking the village. This does happen, and it's up to Parn and his old friend Etoh, a cleric, (a priest who specializes in healing spells,) as well as two other warriors, Ghim, a dwarf warrior who has embarked on a quest to find and bring back home Karla, a young priestess, and his sorceror friend Slayn, to defend the village. After the battle with the goblins is over, the mayor sends Parn and Etoh out to find out the cause of the goblins strange behavior, like going out in daylight. Ghim and Slayn go with them. Soon the four are joined by Deedlit, a high elf maiden. It isn't long before they are captured by guards of the kingdom of Mice (yes, that's what it's called,) who suspect them of being enemy spies, and taken prisoner. While in prison they meet Woodchuck, a thief. They learn of the evil kingdom of Marmo, which is going out on a journey of conquest. Soon the captain of the guards meets them and realizes what a mistake has been made, and he orders the five released. Parn wants to join the guard ranks, but then Marmo attacks. The heros are unable to stop the oncoming army, and barely make it out with Woodchuck in tow. Now they must embark on a quest to save Loduss from evil.Just about everything is great about this show, including the voice acting in both lanuges, but there's one serious problem in the continueity that might have some people confused. Episode 1 actually takes place AFTER episodes 2-5. Why they did this, I have no idea.

My sister and I borrowed this tape from a friend  and now we have almost the whole rest of the series( all but those that  have been commercially released) This new story puts a twist on the old  story lines, but it works out nicely and it helps make room for more  charcters.

Shiris his partner is a mercenary with little qualms about  anything. Deedlit, Parn and the rest who are alive are still the same.  Slayn and Leylia end up having a daughter Neese, who will be a major part  of the story by  volume 4.

While a comfortable setting in that, if you like fantasy, you already know the basics, it is not terribly imaginative.  The story begins as a good vs. evil matchup, but some of the evil characters are far more complex than they appear, and the particulars of the alliances and animosities shift over time.  It's reasonably well-executed and enjoyable, just not fresh or innovative.  The soundtrack is nice, as well--I picked up 3 CDs to get it.  The English dub cast takes some getting used to, as well--some of the voices are a little annoying at first, but I tend to think now that this was intentional.There are some concerns.  First, the story is not chronologcal at first.  It starts after the adventure has begun, then jumps back to start from the beginning; it can be hard to follow.  Second, there are some real quality control problems on this disc.  The second through fourth episodes are grainy and look pretty bad--not unwatchable, but disappointing for DVD.  The audio sometimes goes up then down, which is distracting, but not fatal to enjoyment.
