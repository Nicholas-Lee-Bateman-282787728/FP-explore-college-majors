669629,A31IUA58VO7WYT,B00005NOOV,"J. Davis ""John Davis""","[2, 4]","""Sister Kenny"" is a worthy film-biography about a worthy woman. Rosalind Russell usually turns in a good performance, as she does in this role.Having said, I was disappointed in the ""Australia-lessness"" of this production. I find Australia a fascinating country and was hoping for a good story with some cultural authenticity. But the only thing Australian about this film was the outline of the continent at the beginning and end, behind the credits, and the occasional reference to the ""Royal"" commissions. But nary an authentic Australian accent anywhere -- not even an attempt at one. Even in the short scene set in England the voice over the train station's public address system is American.Apparently it was easy and cheap to represent Australia in the 1940s, if mostly on a studio set. Well, the wagons are similar (borrow from the Western props), the ""frontier"" feels the same (lots of fences and painted skies handy); throw in a few Irish or Scots accents (immigrants, don't you know) and, voila, Australia! When Sister Kenny finally disembarks at San Francisco you feel, well, she's come home at last. G'day, mate.Thanks to the real Sister Kenny for a good and useful life. Her story deserves a more realistic re-telling. Let the Australians do it.

669630,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B00005NOOV,Kevin Killian,"[1, 5]","This movie was written by Dudley Nichols, who had written many of John Ford's greatest movies.  I wonder if he ever offered it to Ford to direct.  Certainly John Ford would have done more to suggest the Australian outback and the general ""frontier spirit"" of the people Sister Kenny toiled among.  In fact, maybe Ford's last movie ""7 Women,"" similarly about a pack of nurses stranded along the frontier, is a kind of tip of the hat to Nichols version of the Sister Kenny saga.When watching the Nichols movie, it's important to realize that Kenny was still alive when this film was made, only sixty in fact when it was released, and she was to live on into the 50s.  The script was taken from her memoirs, AND THEY SHALL WALK, which appeared during the War in 1943, during a critical time in US-Australia relations.  Sister Kenny had sort of been rebuffed from her native Australia, and was practicing at the clinic she had set up in Minnesota, so perhaps in filming this biopic the US was patting itself on the back for accepting yet another ""refugee: with impractical ideas.Alexander Knox, who had starred in the dreary WILSON, was brought in to play the Scottish doctor who comes to approve of Sister Kenny's unorthodox methods.  Dean Jagger is his usual cold self.  Rosalind Russell does a great job of acting in the old ""HAM"" acting tradition she seems to have founded herself.  One appealing thing is that, Roz must have taken a shine to little Doreen McCann, who plays the young girl she heals of polio, for Doreen was to turn up in a prominent part is another Russell film of the very next year, THE GUILT OF JANET AMES, also worthy of DVD treatment.I think they should make a new version of SISTER KENNY that would stick to the facts better, and taking a while chance they should showcase Kylie Minogue in it.  Kylie has been a successful pop star but had never had a suitable nexus for her acting.  Certainly there is little in her past that would wuggest she would make a good Sister Kenny, but Rosalind Russell had never played anything as dramatic either at this point in her career, and look how well it turned out!  And now that Kylie is approaching her late 30s, it would be nice if she had something to fall back on.  Plus she works well with children, of whom there would be plenty in this movie.  And she has helped thousands of sick children (and adults) with her charity work.  This role would be an extension of that.  At least she would have the Aussie accent down pat.",4,"Valiant and Earnest, but not really Australian per se",1113782400,"04 18, 2005",2005,2491,"['movie', 'was', 'written', 'Dudley', 'Nichols', 'who', 'had', 'written', 'many', 'John', 'Ford', 'greatest', 'movies', 'wonder', 'ever', 'offered', 'Ford', 'direct', 'Certainly', 'John', 'Ford', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'suggest', 'Australian', 'outback', 'general', 'frontier', 'spirit', 'people', 'Sister', 'Kenny', 'toiled', 'fact', 'maybe', 'Ford', 'last', 'movie', '7', 'Women', 'similarly', 'pack', 'nurses', 'stranded', 'frontier', 'kind', 'tip', 'hat', 'Nichols', 'version', 'Sister', 'Kenny', 'saga.When', 'watching', 'Nichols', 'movie', 'important', 'realize', 'Kenny', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'only', 'fact', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'live', '50s', 'script', 'was', 'taken', 'memoirs', 'THEY', 'SHALL', 'WALK', 'appeared', 'War', '1943', 'critical', 'time', 'US-Australia', 'relations', 'Sister', 'Kenny', 'had', 'sort', 'been', 'rebuffed', 'native', 'Australia', 'was', 'practicing', 'clinic', 'had', 'set', 'up', 'Minnesota', 'so', 'perhaps', 'filming', 'biopic', 'US', 'was', 'patting', 'back', 'accepting', 'yet', 'refugee', 'impractical', 'ideas.Alexander', 'Knox', 'who', 'had', 'starred', 'dreary', 'WILSON', 'was', 'brought', 'play', 'Scottish', 'doctor', 'who', 'approve', 'Sister', 'Kenny', 'unorthodox', 'methods', 'Dean', 'Jagger', 'usual', 'cold', 'self', 'Rosalind', 'Russell', 'great', 'job', 'acting', 'old', 'HAM', 'acting', 'tradition', 'have', 'founded', 'One', 'appealing', 'thing', 'Roz', 'must', 'have', 'taken', 'shine', 'little', 'Doreen', 'McCann', 'who', 'young', 'girl', 'heals', 'polio', 'Doreen', 'was', 'turn', 'up', 'prominent', 'part', 'Russell', 'film', 'very', 'next', 'year', 'THE', 'GUILT', 'OF', 'JANET', 'AMES', 'also', 'worthy', 'DVD', 'treatment.I', 'think', 'should', 'make', 'new', 'version', 'SISTER', 'KENNY', 'would', 'stick', 'facts', 'better', 'taking', 'while', 'chance', 'should', 'showcase', 'Kylie', 'Minogue', 'Kylie', 'been', 'successful', 'pop', 'star', 'had', 'never', 'had', 'suitable', 'nexus', 'acting', 'Certainly', 'little', 'past', 'would', 'wuggest', 'would', 'make', 'good', 'Sister', 'Kenny', 'Rosalind', 'Russell', 'had', 'never', 'played', 'anything', 'dramatic', 'point', 'career', 'look', 'how', 'well', 'turned', 'out', 'now', 'Kylie', 'approaching', 'late', '30s', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'had', 'something', 'fall', 'back', 'well', 'children', 'whom', 'would', 'be', 'plenty', 'movie', 'helped', 'thousands', 'sick', 'children', 'adults', 'charity', 'work', 'role', 'would', 'be', 'extension', 'least', 'would', 'have', 'Aussie', 'accent', 'down', 'pat']",N/A

As a nurse in isolated areas, and without prior knowledge of the traditional treatment for polio, she treated victims based on her observation of the symptoms.  She used new words like &quot;spasm&quot;, used hot compresses, and re-educated muscles.  Her treatment was so successful that she eventually opened her own clinics.  The movie shows the sacrifices she made in her own personal life, because of her calling to help children who contracted polio.  It took a long time for her approach to be recognized by the male dominated medical establishment.  It is a very heart-warming story and I admit I get goosebumps in a few places, especially at the moment that she realizes that children who are not treated using her method are still crippled from the disease.
