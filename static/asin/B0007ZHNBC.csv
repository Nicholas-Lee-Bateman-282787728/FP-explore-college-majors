896819,A21U04RIT5AUDJ,B0007ZHNBC,A Reader with Gratitude and Appreciation,"[18, 18]","This is a DVD in the extension of ""What the Bleep Do we know"".  It is a recording out of JZKnight's conferences (I think).  After I watched the DVD, I have mix feelings towards the teachings.  Words are animating when it is coming out of JZKnight (Ramtha's mind), of course.  His/her words are powerful if you use your heart to listen and to understand, to implement such teaching to create your day and make a change consciously.  Yet, the message behind the presentation is not anything human beings have not heard of ever.  Consciousness, go listen to Eckhart Tolle's CDs about ""The Power of now"".  Consciousness, go read Don Miguel Ruiz's books.  Ramtha's teaching (the enlightened One), is not that unique of a concept either.  But it is so amazing to me that all the students follow like a servant instead of using Ramtha's words as a way to empower themselves.  Even the Bible and Buddhism are originally created to inspire human beings to grow and to find out their true beautiful nature.The heart of the message around Ramtha's teaching is to break away from the mental prison the society, religion has created to limit ourselves. The heart of the message around his (her) teaching is that man and woman are equal, even Ramtha's followers and Ramtha (himself/herself) are in equal footing with Ramtha.  Teacher is what we can call Ramtha, yet, Ramtha can and should only inspire us and to empower us.  We should never allow any other identity of the outside world take control/take over our own spirit (meaning our own divine right to make our own life decisions).  Ramtha's words are powerful if you allow his words to inspire the spirit inside you to grow out of your own shell.  But certainly, I feel that Ramtha's way is NOT the only way to exceed our current potential.  I feel that there many other ways, other forms of teaching that can inspire us to grow and become the unique individual, the enlightened (awaken) one.Ramtha's words, is not meant to be lived like a gospel for others to rigidly follow.  It requires each human being to think, to process his/her message and allow us to come up of our own way of how we want to live lives for our own self.  Take what make sense to you and leave what does not make sense to you.  Enlightenment, what a way to express one self.  But everyone's path to enlightenment is different.  And everyone's experience of enlightenment (awakening) is different.  There is no such a place call the promise land/heaven for you to seek and to live joyfully ever after.  Heaven exists in the mind level and exists in the now.  Heaven is a state of mind and Ramtha's words/teachings is one of the many ways to help us get there (which is actually here and now because it is your conscious mind that allows you to see your own divine, joyful being).  There are many different roads you can follow through to awaken your own spirit.  There is no right and wrong.Ramtha cannot save you.  It is the same as Jesus Christ did not save us.  But allowing Ramtha's teaching (or any other teachers' teaching) for our daily inspiration will ""save"" us from entering the state of mind call hell (or we should say redirecting our mind to enter heaven).  Jesus' 33 years of life on Earth is another inspiration of how we can live a life out of the mental prison because of judgment and fear.",4,Inspiring if you allow it to be ...

896822,A3UV7L5ND3EH8T,B0007ZHNBC,"Janet Boyer ""Snowland Deck and Coffee Tarot C...","[330, 353]","""To let life happen to you is irresponsible. To create your day is your divine right."" -RamthaYou're always creating your day-and your reality-regardless of whether you consciously intend to do so. That is, your thoughts affect your reality just as the Observer affects the Quantum Field. Our attitudes, assumptions, and expectations reinforce the neural net of our brains. The good news is that we can expand-and change-this neural net by consciously creating our day.Before we fully awaken, we are dis-identified with our ""identity"". We literally re-orient ourselves to familiar ruts when we begin to think along the same lines day after day.  However, before we ""bond"" with our neural net, we can literally choose to create our day according to what we'd like to experience. Ramtha gives a word of caution, however: ""create only those things you are willing to accept.""According to Ramtha, Quantum Physics is the only science that factors in your opinion. This is why you-and your thoughts-matter so much. In fact, Ramtha says that you matter, and would be greatly missed in this time if you weren't here.This 45 minute DVD is purely Ramtha speaking to the camera (though J.Z. Knight). Although Mark Vincente had a hand in it, neither he nor any of the individuals featured in the movie What the Bleep Do We Know?! are featured in this DVD. I love the fact that there are no ""fillers"" or grand introductions to this DVD. The video begins-and ends-with Ramtha speaking about how we can create our day with awareness.In this delightful invitation to open your mind, Ramtha explains how thought is the architecture of reality-and how to MAKE life happen...rather than have it happen TO us. The superstitious, as well as those who think this is all hogwash, are creating their day. Everyone gets to have what they deem necessary, says Ramtha.Ramtha also addresses our notions of God and how we've created Him in OUR image, rather than the reverse. ""Pretty soon"", says Ramtha, ""you'll graduate God from something mean and fearful to something sublime...The greatest worship we can have for God is to live LIKE God. The greatest gift we have is not what God can give us, but to celebrate live every day.""My favorite parts of this DVD are when Ramtha explains what doubt is...as well as the definition-and purpose-of hope. ""Doubt is a word describing a desire not to participate. Doubt keeps you from changing your life, your beliefs, you religion..."" Hope, on the other hand, is ""the permission to think beyond restraint-to live without confinement...Possibilities ring the bell of hope. Is it possible to live beyond my confinement?""Ramtha answers this question with a resounding YES. Yes, indeed, you CAN live beyond the restraint of established thought and the environmental reinforcement of those thoughts!You were just waiting for someone to encourage you to be the ""more"" that you are, weren't you?Today, I will have an encounter with the unusual.What will YOU create today?",5,What Will YOU Create Today?,1112313600,"04 1, 2005",2005,2977,"['let', 'life', 'happen', 'irresponsible', 'create', 'day', 'divine', 'right', ""'re"", 'always', 'creating', 'day-and', 'reality-regardless', 'consciously', 'intend', 'do', 'so', 'thoughts', 'affect', 'reality', 'just', 'Observer', 'Quantum', 'Field', 'attitudes', 'assumptions', 'expectations', 'reinforce', 'neural', 'net', 'brains', 'good', 'news', 'can', 'expand-and', 'change-this', 'neural', 'net', 'consciously', 'creating', 'day.Before', 'fully', 'awaken', 'are', 'dis-identified', 'identity', 'literally', 're-orient', 'ourselves', 'familiar', 'ruts', 'when', 'begin', 'think', 'same', 'lines', 'day', 'day', 'However', 'bond', 'neural', 'net', 'can', 'literally', 'choose', 'create', 'day', 'according', 'what', ""'d"", 'like', 'experience', 'Ramtha', 'word', 'caution', 'however', 'create', 'only', 'things', 'are', 'willing', 'accept', 'According', 'Ramtha', 'Quantum', 'Physics', 'only', 'science', 'factors', 'opinion', 'why', 'you-and', 'thoughts-matter', 'so', 'much', 'fact', 'Ramtha', 'matter', 'would', 'be', 'greatly', 'missed', 'time', 'were', ""n't"", 'here.This', '45', 'minute', 'DVD', 'purely', 'Ramtha', 'speaking', 'camera', 'J.Z', 'Knight', 'Mark', 'Vincente', 'had', 'hand', 'individuals', 'featured', 'movie', 'What', 'Bleep', 'Do', 'Know', 'are', 'featured', 'DVD', 'love', 'fact', 'are', 'fillers', 'grand', 'introductions', 'DVD', 'video', 'begins-and', 'ends-with', 'Ramtha', 'speaking', 'how', 'can', 'create', 'day', 'awareness.In', 'delightful', 'invitation', 'open', 'mind', 'Ramtha', 'how', 'thought', 'architecture', 'reality-and', 'how', 'MAKE', 'life', 'happen', 'rather', 'have', 'happen', 'TO', 'superstitious', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'think', 'hogwash', 'are', 'creating', 'day', 'Everyone', 'have', 'what', 'deem', 'necessary', 'Ramtha.Ramtha', 'also', 'notions', 'God', 'how', ""'ve"", 'created', 'Him', 'OUR', 'image', 'rather', 'reverse', 'Pretty', 'soon', 'Ramtha', ""'ll"", 'graduate', 'God', 'something', 'mean', 'fearful', 'something', 'sublime', 'greatest', 'worship', 'can', 'have', 'God', 'live', 'LIKE', 'God', 'greatest', 'gift', 'have', 'not', 'what', 'God', 'can', 'give', 'celebrate', 'live', 'day', 'favorite', 'parts', 'DVD', 'are', 'when', 'Ramtha', 'what', 'doubt', 'as', 'well', 'definition-and', 'purpose-of', 'hope', 'Doubt', 'word', 'describing', 'desire', 'not', 'participate', 'Doubt', 'changing', 'life', 'beliefs', 'religion', 'Hope', 'other', 'hand', 'permission', 'think', 'restraint-to', 'live', 'confinement', 'ring', 'bell', 'hope', 'possible', 'live', 'confinement', 'Ramtha', 'question', 'resounding', 'YES', 'Yes', 'indeed', 'CAN', 'live', 'restraint', 'established', 'thought', 'environmental', 'reinforcement', 'thoughts', 'were', 'just', 'waiting', 'someone', 'encourage', 'be', 'more', 'are', 'were', ""n't"", 'Today', 'will', 'have', 'encounter', 'will', 'YOU', 'create', 'today']","Ramtha: Create Your Day - An Invitation To Open Your Mind from Mark Vicente, director of What The Bleep Do We Know!?"

However, as soon as I saw JZ Knight I had my doubts. She seemed to me be a huckster. I wondered why, with all of the really solid spiritual teachers available, the filmmakers would choose her. The other talking heads were a bit uneven, but one or two seemed like they might be solid. Anyway, I saw the movie twice and then, because I still had doubts, I looked into the film a little more and found a few unsettling items:*Followers of JZ Knight made the film. They were apparently unconcerned that in the 1980s she had her students use copper to shield against aliens, that she had predicted a number of apocalyptic disasters which never occurred, that it can cost thousands to hear her talk (yes, I know that initial lectures are less expensive).*One of her former students says he quit working with her after finding her practicing her Ramtha voices. It didn't seem to me she had practiced them very well!*The psychiatrist studying physics, Jeffrey Satinover, has a book calling for attempting to cure homosexuals. He believes that they are ill. He lists Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas as one of his heroes!*The Irish theologian in the film had to resign as president of his college as a result of a scandal.*Many of the ""scientists"" are lecturers at Knight's center.==> One of the few real scientists in the film, David Albert, has charged the filmmakers with carefully selecting bits of his hours of interview to present a point of view that is 180 degrees opposite of what he said. THINK ABOUT THIS. The filmmakers have, I believe, discredited themselves entirely through their misrepresentation of Dr. Albert's views. Why would they do this if they were really interested in the truth? &lt;==I really believe that intentions matter and that they shape our life. If you agree, please ask yourself, what could possibly be the intentions of filmmakers who distort the material provided in interviews? More importantly, what is the intention of JZ Knight in making up a story about channeling a 35,000 year old teacher from Atlantis? DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS AN ENLIGHTENED CIVILIZATION CALLED ATLANTIS EVEN THOUGH THERE IS NO PHYSICAL RECORD OF IT HAVING EVER EXISTED???
