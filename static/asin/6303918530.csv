Physical education class was just like the one shown with my favorite memories of the fire alarm drill going off while we were showering and commando basketball, where you wore a boxing glove on one hand and there were no fouls called because you could hit the guy with the ball.  The girlfriend issue where the girl's friend asks you if you like her friend and the awkward dancing.  The boring science teacher was a hoot.  The time period occurred about 5 years after me, but the kids look like Junior High kids and the way the girls dressed was right on the money(something I miss with how high school girls dress these days.)

388607,A1HJ3FXGGCVQDA,6303918530,"Hadi Jones ""The Tree""","[5, 6]","Wonder Years was one of the most captivating and favorite shows I've followed in the 90's. Watching re-runs on TV can bring that sense of nostalgia because the show was that impactful. It doesn't necessarily have to appeal to hardcore fans. The show contains mild comedy and that 'coming-of-age' style story that makes it one of the best dramas in 90's TV.The show chronicles the life of Kevin Arnold, a caucasian middle-class adolecent growing up on the well titled wonder years or the 60's. Basically, he gives us his anecdote about growing up in those years and how he as an adolecent overcame most of life's obstacles - something many teens face. The best thing about the show was that it contained some situations that many teens faced in life - here we see how to overcome it and the hilarity and familiarity of it. It's also about love, family and high school. The show's fame mirrored onto shows such as Dilbert, Hey Arnold and The Simpsons - where the narrator Daniel Stern voiced Bart's adventures as he assumed the role of Kevin Arnold.The show has a strong premise. We all have experienced love, loss, fights, authroity, being grounded and ambition. The Wonder Years started out a bit shaky but eventually gained fame after showing with perfection how a normal adolecent hurdle life's obstacles while living through the 60's. The show is very recommenable.

388615,AP3B615GM191G,6303918530,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","The first &#34;season&#34; (six episodes) of &#34;The Wonder Years&#34; does a great job of introducing the primary characters and the format of the show.  In this second season, however, the show writers/producers really get down to the business of telling some tremendous stories.In this season, Kevin Arnold (Fred Savage) is in seventh grade in 1968, with all the cultural and familial milestones of being that age in that time.  His on-again off-again relationship with Winnie Cooper (Danica McKellar) is a central focus, as is his relationship with father Jack (Dan Lauria), mother Norma (Alley Mills), brother Wayne (Jason Hervey), and sister Karen (Olivia D'abo).  Best friend Paul Pffiefer (Josh Saviano) also plays a large role in his life.Some of the highlights of this season include...-The beginnings of a relationship between Kevin and Becky Slater (Crystal McKellar)...and what a hilariously complex pairing it is!-Norma taking a pottery class that Jack isn't comfortable with.-A Vietnam walkout-The school bully, Eddie Pinetti (Robert Jayne)-Karen joining the Hippy Movement-Square-dancing physical education unit with &#34;weird girl&#34; Margaret Farquhar (Lindsay Fisher).  Bats, anyone?While that first mini-season served as an appetizer for what was to come, this season is where the writing/acting really starts to take off.  Not since &#34;All In The Family&#34; had a show combined period topics with a perfect mix of humor and drama.  There is not a single episode in this season that doesn't either make you laugh, cry, or think (and all those three things usually happen in EVERY episode!).While &#34;The Wonder Years&#34; can best be enjoyed by &#34;those who lived it&#34;, its themes of family, friendship, and coming-of-age are timeless and can be enjoyed by new audiences every year.Thus, if you were intrigued by the first season of this show whatsoever, you will not be disappointed in its sophomore effort.  As the characters grow and the years go by, the writing/acting perfectly change to meet them.
