I got season 1 from Hong-Kong; dual language, tri-language subtitling, excelent quality, entire series for $60 or less new. For the dubb the voices weren't bad, BUT it takes Sanzo's & Hakkai's voice actors a good 10 episodes to get a good FEEL for the personalities. In the first few episodes, Hakkai will use 'vulger' language & Sanzo will just sound 'wrong,' but when the actors effeminate Hakkai's tone & manners & deepen & soften Sanzo's tone it's just right.",4,"Great Series, Misleading ""boxed set.""",1145491200,"04 20, 2006",2006,551,"['Boxed', 'set', 'what', '1', 'DVD', 'extras', 'do', 'NOT', 'make', 'SET', 'thought', 'was', 'whole', 'series', 'got', 'season', '1', 'Hong-Kong', 'dual', 'language', 'tri-language', 'subtitling', 'excelent', 'quality', 'entire', 'series', '60', 'less', 'new', 'dubb', 'voices', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'BUT', 'Sanzo', 'Hakkai', 'voice', 'actors', 'good', '10', 'episodes', 'get', 'good', 'FEEL', 'personalities', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'Hakkai', 'will', 'use', ""'vulger"", 'language', 'Sanzo', 'will', 'just', 'sound', ""'wrong"", 'when', 'actors', 'effeminate', 'Hakkai', 'tone', 'manners', 'deepen', 'soften', 'Sanzo', 'tone', 'just', 'right']",Saiyuki Reload - Volume 1
865592,AG1ZRMHJLYXEE,B0006FFRJS,M. Hammond,"[2, 3]","Humans are such creatures of habit.I was a bit put off by the change in attitude of the new series, but we all knew with Geneon taking over we'd get a different voice cast. I'm just grateful Pioneer did it right & went to Bang Zoom.The show changed director from Hayato Date(now on Naruto) to Tetsuya Endo (storyboard/Boogiepop Phantom, Director/Hikaru No Go) & he shifted the feel to our heroes as celebrities-we even first spy them in shades doing the low-profile thing. The Ura-Sai are possibly the best thing about a couple of the eps, but the title gets its sea legs by the mid-way point so the Kami arc works well.The voices. Get over it. Anyone who listened to the commentary on Requiem heard David Matranga moved to New York & was flown in for that last commentary, but even had ADV kept Saiyuki, we'd have had a new Sanzo. Playing audio-track pop-over, Bang Zoom, as usual, did a much better job matching the dub voices to their original (In what universe does David Matranga sound like Toshihiko Seki? I love Greg Ayres, but he doesn't sound like Souichiro Hoshi. Same for Illich Guardiola/Hiroaki Hirata-picked to dub Captain Jack Sparrow in Kingdom Hearts 2-I can see there is a similarity to Johnny Depp's voice). And when I first heard ""Hawk-eye"" I did the audio track pop-over again. Yep, Souichiro Hoshi does sound like he's saying Hawk-eye. It took a bit to get familiar with the new voices, but since I usually watch Saiyuki twice(for each audio track), I can see the new dub is much closer to the original. The thing I love about Bang Zoom is they seem to pay more attention to the dub. Anyone who watched the Magic Knight Rayearth commentaries has to remember Lex Lang (Sanzo, also Sano/Rurouni Kenshin, Lantis\Zagato/MKR, King of En/12 Kingdoms, Crim/.hack//sign) discussing the cast sitting around listening to the original audio track to see how the Japanese cast played it. As much as I enjoy the usual ADV dub, they are one of the studios known to play it a bit fast & loose with the dub script (Kimera was played by Nobuo Tobita originally while ADV's dub played the character as a chick). As someone who regularly watches the English dub with the Japanese subtitles up to see how close the dub script ran, I regularly noticed ADV kept the spirit of the dub far more than a close translation.On the Japanese side-either ADV mis-translated the name, or we have a different Dokugakuji-this time out Geneon is crediting Jurouta Kosugi(Zagato/Lantis/MKR).My daughter did notice an improvement in the background characters. Date has said in interviews the studio cut it's teeth on computer animation with the first Saiyuki title & that's part of why the color-change on Goyjo's hair--red is a common background color so he preferred to steer clear of using it for one of the leads.The only reason this is a star shy of perfect is the director's taking so long to figure out which direction to take the series. Once he decided to slip into the prior title's mode, it works well. If you really hate the dub, just listen to the original audio since Japan usually seems to pay far more attention to the vocal casting of the characters than America does.",4,Creatures of habit,1146355200,"04 30, 2006",2006,3170,"['Humans', 'are', 'such', 'creatures', 'habit.I', 'was', 'bit', 'put', 'off', 'change', 'attitude', 'new', 'series', 'knew', 'Geneon', 'taking', ""'d"", 'get', 'different', 'voice', 'cast', ""'m"", 'just', 'grateful', 'Pioneer', 'did', 'right', 'went', 'Bang', 'Zoom.The', 'show', 'changed', 'director', 'Hayato', 'Date', 'now', 'Naruto', 'Tetsuya', 'Endo', 'storyboard/Boogiepop', 'Phantom', 'Director/Hikaru', 'No', 'Go', 'shifted', 'feel', 'heroes', 'celebrities-we', 'even', 'first', 'spy', 'shades', 'doing', 'low-profile', 'thing', 'Ura-Sai', 'are', 'possibly', 'best', 'thing', 'couple', 'eps', 'title', 'sea', 'legs', 'mid-way', 'point', 'Kami', 'arc', 'well.The', 'voices', 'Get', 'Anyone', 'who', 'listened', 'commentary', 'Requiem', 'heard', 'David', 'Matranga', 'moved', 'New', 'York', 'was', 'flown', 'last', 'commentary', 'even', 'had', 'ADV', 'kept', 'Saiyuki', ""'d"", 'have', 'had', 'new', 'Sanzo', 'Playing', 'audio-track', 'pop-over', 'Bang', 'Zoom', 'usual', 'did', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'matching', 'dub', 'voices', 'original', 'what', 'universe', 'David', 'Matranga', 'sound', 'Toshihiko', 'Seki', 'love', 'Greg', 'Ayres', ""n't"", 'sound', 'Souichiro', 'Hoshi', 'Same', 'Illich', 'Guardiola/Hiroaki', 'Hirata-picked', 'dub', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'Kingdom', 'Hearts', '2-I', 'can', 'see', 'similarity', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'voice', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'Hawk-eye', 'did', 'audio', 'track', 'pop-over', 'again', 'Yep', 'Souichiro', 'Hoshi', 'sound', 'saying', 'Hawk-eye', 'took', 'bit', 'get', 'familiar', 'new', 'voices', 'usually', 'watch', 'Saiyuki', 'twice', 'audio', 'track', 'can', 'see', 'new', 'dub', 'much', 'closer', 'original', 'thing', 'love', 'Bang', 'Zoom', 'seem', 'pay', 'more', 'attention', 'dub', 'Anyone', 'who', 'watched', 'Magic', 'Knight', 'Rayearth', 'commentaries', 'remember', 'Lex', 'Lang', 'Sanzo', 'also', 'Sano/Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'Lantis\\Zagato/MKR', 'King', 'En/12', 'Kingdoms', 'Crim/.hack//sign', 'discussing', 'cast', 'sitting', 'around', 'listening', 'original', 'audio', 'track', 'see', 'how', 'Japanese', 'cast', 'played', 'As', 'much', 'enjoy', 'usual', 'ADV', 'dub', 'are', 'one', 'studios', 'known', 'play', 'bit', 'fast', 'loose', 'dub', 'script', 'Kimera', 'was', 'played', 'Nobuo', 'Tobita', 'originally', 'ADV', 'dub', 'played', 'character', 'chick', 'someone', 'who', 'regularly', 'English', 'dub', 'Japanese', 'up', 'see', 'how', 'close', 'dub', 'script', 'ran', 'regularly', 'noticed', 'ADV', 'kept', 'spirit', 'dub', 'far', 'more', 'close', 'translation.On', 'Japanese', 'side-either', 'ADV', 'mis-translated', 'name', 'have', 'different', 'Dokugakuji-this', 'time', 'out', 'Geneon', 'crediting', 'Jurouta', 'Kosugi', 'Zagato/Lantis/MKR', '.My', 'daughter', 'did', 'notice', 'improvement', 'background', 'characters', 'Date', 'said', 'interviews', 'studio', 'cut', 'teeth', 'computer', 'animation', 'first', 'Saiyuki', 'title', 'part', 'why', 'color-change', 'Goyjo', 'hair', 'red', 'common', 'background', 'color', 'preferred', 'steer', 'clear', 'using', 'one', 'leads.The', 'only', 'reason', 'star', 'shy', 'perfect', 'director', 'taking', 'so', 'long', 'figure', 'out', 'direction', 'take', 'series', 'decided', 'slip', 'prior', 'title', 'mode', 'well', 'really', 'hate', 'dub', 'just', 'listen', 'original', 'audio', 'Japan', 'usually', 'pay', 'far', 'more', 'attention', 'vocal', 'casting', 'characters', 'America']",Saiyuki Reload - Volume 1

Only a real fan would understand why they changed the voice actors at the second and third season-hello they're maturing as the episodes progress towards the end. You don't really expect to have the same voice when you age do you? It's realistic how they did it and I absolutely love the collection as well as the mangas. This is something i would definitely camp outside of a movie theater to see its big premiere (if there was one) lol! Enjoy the series and seek for understanding!

Or that the fighting has become more simplified?  Or the costumes more simplified? Or that the group is now the ""Sanzo Party""?  It's like the Geneon ""party"" read a review and started from there instead of watching the previous series and reading the support details.  I mean I thought it was funny the way Sanzo was always threatening to kill his cohorts and POINTED his gun at them.  Reload seems to be a watered down version of of the first two seasons.  Perhaps for US sales?In all fairness, as the series progresses, Geneon does try to repair these mistakes in thier poor planing in subsequent volumes and the series get better and is worth buying.I paid $39.95 for an English dubbed perfect collection.  I wouldn't want to have paid more though.  I hope Gunlock is better because I plan to buy it too.  Why?  Because I like it and the improvements in the Reload series as it progressed give me optimism that Gunlock will be a better collection.",3,Disappointed at first vol.

The characters still go on their long journey to the west and the comedy is back with a whole new segment in every episode called Ura-Sai which is like a behind the scenes of the Saiyuki characters(not the voice actors)and its just a quick 1 to 2 minute extra on every episode that is always funny and can give you a good laugh. The action is also back and better then ever. The new music for this series is pretty good especially the opening song and the 2nd ending song.
