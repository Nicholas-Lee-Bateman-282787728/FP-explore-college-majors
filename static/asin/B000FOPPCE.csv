While George Strait is not an A-List actor, he gives a solid performance. Besides, his list of lifetime accomplishments far outweigh most actors 10 fold.Honeysuckle Rose is just packed with Willie Nelson tunes.  While Nelson is also not an A-List actor, Amy Irving and Dyan Cannon certainly fit the bill.  I'm partial to ""Song For You"", a tune Willie sings at the end of the movie.  And, practically stealing the show is veteran character actor Slim Pickens, who comically swears with flair making ""Honeysuckle"" a ""sweet"" affair.",4,Pure Country & Honeysuckle Rose together,1151107200,"06 24, 2006",2006,645,"['family', 'love', 'Pure', 'Country', 'simple', 'pleasurable', 'movie', 'predictable', 'delightful', 'ending', 'George', 'Strait', 'not', 'A-List', 'actor', 'solid', 'performance', 'list', 'lifetime', 'accomplishments', 'far', 'outweigh', 'most', 'actors', '10', 'fold.Honeysuckle', 'Rose', 'just', 'packed', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'tunes', 'Nelson', 'also', 'not', 'A-List', 'actor', 'Amy', 'Irving', 'Dyan', 'Cannon', 'certainly', 'fit', 'bill', ""'m"", 'partial', 'Song', 'tune', 'Willie', 'sings', 'end', 'movie', 'practically', 'stealing', 'show', 'veteran', 'character', 'actor', 'Slim', 'Pickens', 'who', 'comically', 'flair', 'making', 'Honeysuckle', 'sweet', 'affair']",Western Double Feature Pure Country/Honeysuckle Rose
