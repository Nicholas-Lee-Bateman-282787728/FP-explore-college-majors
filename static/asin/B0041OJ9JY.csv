1381972,A36S3B9YN37K05,B0041OJ9JY,Cartoon Head,"[10, 10]","We happened to catch the UK version on Life of Mars when Series One was featured on the Indie Channel on Comcast cable, and it just happened to coincide with the 3 weeks later run of the American remake version.  So for a while we were watching both versions of that series, the original and the US interpretation.  We definitely found the UK version more inspired and exciting, and couldn't wait to watch each new episode, while watching the US one was mostly because of Gretchen Moll.  (Well, for me anyway!)  It was funny to see the casting comparisons too.The US series got quickly cancelled and wrapped it up with a trite and unsatisfying ending.  It was clever, indeed, but it seemed hollow and shallow.  Sigh.  That was it?By that time the original series was still going, onto its Series Two.  We were entranced, but worried.  Fortunately, I learned that the UK ending was totally different than the US ending.  (Whew.)  And sure enough, by the end of Life on Mars UK, it was a definitely more intriguing ending and left lots of unanswered questions and potential.It was actually that series together with the dark comedy Ideal (also on the Indie Channel) that prompted us to buy an all-region DVD player.  What other really good UK programs were we missing?  We started ordering complete series like Peep Show, The In-Betweeners, Benidorm, Nighty Night, Pulling, Sugar Rush, and others.  ABSOLUTELY SMASHING!!!  One better than the next.  We hardly watch American programs any more, other than the cooking, travel and weather channels!Having given up on Indie Channel showing Ashes to Ashes, we decided it was time to just order it too.At first we were only moderately impressed.  The 80's theme was fun, the Quattro brought back memories, and it was good to see the old team in action again.  But the story line was getting worrisome: ""I've got to get back to my daughter!""  (Ugh.  Themes involving devotion to children ruin most of the American programs.  Not here too!  Oh no!)  But fortunately, the obsession to get back to Molly (the blessed daughter) quickly moved to the background, and the story focused more on Alex's relationship with her parents and their impending death.  That mirrored Sam's plot line to save his mother, but it was different enough to make it interesting and unique.After the first Series, the second one started off weird.  Life On Mars had a more concrete explanation about Sam's return, but Series Two sort of edited that part out.  (But not to worry, it's explained later in Series Three.  Maybe the writers realized it too.  But you'll need to take a ""leap of faith"" though and just trust that it will all make sense by the conclusion.)As the third series started, you knew you were in for a treat.  It was all about character development now, and you really got to know the underlying back stories for all of these characters, some of which you've been following for 4 seasons now, concluding with the deepest back story of all, Gene Hunt.I can't say any more because it would ruin the fun, and it was so amazing that the community out there doesn't really give it away.  All I can say is, you'll think you have it all figured out, but you've only scratched the surface.  The writers gave it a brilliant twist that comes with an emotional wallop.And in hindsight, there's still that ONE LOOSE END about the villain in Series One... which never really gets answered (""So how did he KNOW about Alex?"").  So there actually IS potential for a third series if they ever want to go there again.  Maybe...About the closest I have seen to this kind of writing in the US has been the series ""Justified"" on FX.  Brilliant all around.  Definitely worth the cost of an all-region DVD player too.",5,"Brilliant twist to the ending, so good to see good writing",1341792000,"07 9, 2012",2012,3729,"['happened', 'catch', 'UK', 'version', 'Life', 'Mars', 'when', 'Series', 'One', 'was', 'featured', 'Indie', 'Channel', 'Comcast', 'cable', 'just', 'happened', 'coincide', '3', 'weeks', 'later', 'run', 'American', 'remake', 'version', 'So', 'while', 'were', 'watching', 'versions', 'series', 'original', 'US', 'interpretation', 'definitely', 'found', 'UK', 'version', 'more', 'inspired', 'exciting', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'watch', 'new', 'episode', 'watching', 'US', 'one', 'was', 'mostly', 'Gretchen', 'Moll', 'Well', 'anyway', 'was', 'funny', 'see', 'casting', 'comparisons', 'too.The', 'US', 'series', 'got', 'quickly', 'cancelled', 'wrapped', 'up', 'trite', 'unsatisfying', 'ending', 'was', 'clever', 'indeed', 'seemed', 'hollow', 'shallow', 'Sigh', 'was', 'time', 'original', 'series', 'was', 'still', 'going', 'Series', 'Two', 'were', 'entranced', 'worried', 'Fortunately', 'learned', 'UK', 'ending', 'was', 'totally', 'different', 'US', 'ending', 'Whew', 'sure', 'enough', 'end', 'Life', 'Mars', 'UK', 'was', 'definitely', 'more', 'intriguing', 'ending', 'left', 'lots', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'potential.It', 'was', 'actually', 'series', 'together', 'dark', 'comedy', 'Ideal', 'also', 'Indie', 'Channel', 'prompted', 'buy', 'all-region', 'DVD', 'player', 'What', 'other', 'really', 'good', 'UK', 'programs', 'were', 'missing', 'started', 'ordering', 'complete', 'series', 'Peep', 'Show', 'In-Betweeners', 'Benidorm', 'Nighty', 'Night', 'Pulling', 'Sugar', 'Rush', 'others', 'ABSOLUTELY', 'SMASHING', 'One', 'better', 'next', 'hardly', 'watch', 'American', 'programs', 'more', 'other', 'cooking', 'travel', 'weather', 'channels', 'Having', 'given', 'up', 'Indie', 'Channel', 'showing', 'Ashes', 'Ashes', 'decided', 'was', 'time', 'just', 'order', 'first', 'were', 'only', 'moderately', 'impressed', '80', 'theme', 'was', 'fun', 'Quattro', 'brought', 'back', 'memories', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'old', 'team', 'action', 'again', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'getting', 'worrisome', ""'ve"", 'got', 'get', 'back', 'daughter', 'Ugh', 'Themes', 'involving', 'devotion', 'children', 'most', 'American', 'programs', 'Not', 'here', 'too', 'Oh', 'fortunately', 'obsession', 'get', 'back', 'Molly', 'blessed', 'daughter', 'quickly', 'moved', 'background', 'story', 'focused', 'more', 'Alex', 'relationship', 'parents', 'impending', 'death', 'mirrored', 'Sam', 'plot', 'line', 'save', 'mother', 'was', 'different', 'enough', 'make', 'interesting', 'unique.After', 'first', 'Series', 'second', 'one', 'started', 'weird', 'Life', 'Mars', 'had', 'more', 'concrete', 'explanation', 'Sam', 'return', 'Series', 'Two', 'sort', 'edited', 'part', 'not', 'worry', 'explained', 'later', 'Series', 'Three', 'Maybe', 'writers', 'realized', 'too', ""'ll"", 'need', 'take', 'leap', 'faith', 'just', 'trust', 'will', 'make', 'sense', 'conclusion', 'third', 'series', 'started', 'knew', 'were', 'treat', 'was', 'character', 'development', 'now', 'really', 'got', 'know', 'underlying', 'back', 'stories', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'been', 'following', '4', 'seasons', 'now', 'concluding', 'deepest', 'back', 'story', 'Gene', 'Hunt.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'would', 'ruin', 'fun', 'was', 'so', 'amazing', 'community', 'there', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'away', 'can', 'say', ""'ll"", 'think', 'have', 'figured', 'out', ""'ve"", 'only', 'scratched', 'surface', 'writers', 'gave', 'brilliant', 'twist', 'emotional', 'wallop.And', 'hindsight', 'still', 'ONE', 'LOOSE', 'END', 'villain', 'Series', 'One', 'never', 'really', 'answered', 'So', 'how', 'did', 'KNOW', 'Alex', 'So', 'actually', 'potential', 'third', 'series', 'ever', 'want', 'go', 'there', 'again', 'Maybe', 'closest', 'have', 'seen', 'kind', 'writing', 'US', 'been', 'series', 'Justified', 'FX', 'Brilliant', 'around', 'Definitely', 'cost', 'all-region', 'DVD', 'player', 'too']",N/A

The US ending was stellar for Life on Mars, far different from the UK ending, which was good but not as ""WOW"" as the US. Then I find Ashes to Ashes and this series ending is incredible, brilliant.Won't give any spoilers but my suspicions about certain characters from Mars were confirmed in the finale.TV like only the Brits can do. I am so happy that we here in the colonies finally decided to add better continuity and closed series arcs. as good as it started M*A*S*H ran about 10 years too long. UK has far less jump the shark series  and Mars and Ashes prove it. As much as I loved John Simms and his ""Sam Taylor"" I was most happy to see Philip Glenester reprise the Gene ""Genie"" Hunt. A brilliant actor. My one observation, that compared to a real 1980's cop show , Miami Vice... Ashes didn't capture the 80's (And I even spent a good part of 1982 in London.) However it is possible that a Brit may be more in tun with the 80's London scene then I, and feel different.But stll over all, Ashes is a great show with a classic cast and a dynamite wrap up!!

1381974,A3LQDYVAAHHV2T,B0041OJ9JY,FYI,"[4, 4]","Why this series is not more widely available remains a mystery. You'll need a Region-free DVD player to enjoy it. Alter expectations a bit, ""Ashes to Ashes"" has tough boots to fill, but Gene Hunt (Philip Glenister) continues his biting humor and gravitas. This vehicle occasionally goes off-track: spare us the clowns! It's one thing to have Sam Tyler tormented by a little girl & her puppet/doll, but in Series 1, ""Ashes to Ashes"" overly focuses on a grotesque clown (like one in David Bowie's ""Ashes to Ashes"" music video). This repetitive image antagonizes, even when we discover its true identity (thankfully, end of clown!). And, for inexplicable reasons, the writers moved the narrative from the lively, pungent, evocative streets of Manchester, to a London barely seen (filmed mostly in Wales, a country with the best rugby team of all time). They make the lead a woman (no problem there), but she is brittle and shrill (no fault of the actress), and fixate on her attributes, something Sam Tyler (John Simm) never had to endure. Alex Drake (Keeley Hawes) is tarted up in inappropriate outfits for a DCI, even if it's the 1980s; a DCI would never dress like aFlashdancewannabe while at work. This doesn't come across as cutting-edge, just bland pubescence from the writers. Keeley Hawes is a fine actor; as Alex Drake she was unfairly criticized by those who expected anotherLife on Mars: The Complete Collection (U.K.). Compared to Annie Cartwright, the female characters are weak, including Shaz (Montserrat Lombard), again no fault of the actors involved. But persevere, the outcome of ""Ashes to Ashes"" is well worth it!In 2008, Drake is a policewoman with the London Metropolitan Police; she has been studying Sam Tyler's records after he regained consciousness in the present. After a harrowing hostage situation, witnessed by her young daughter Molly, she is shot by a vicious criminal named Arthur Layton, who claims to know her. To her shock, she wakes up dressed as (you guessed it) a slag for hire in 1981. Keeley Hawes as Alex Drake is excellent at conveying the torment about being away from her daughter, and her pain in dealing with her parents in 1981. Like Sam Tyler, she has to face them as an adult, creating some of the best scenes in ""Ashes to Ashes."" Hawes is impeccably convincing. Alex tries to save her politically active parents, who are lawyers during Margaret Thatcher's reign. The return of the magnificent three: Gene Hunt (Philip Glenister), Ray Carling (Dean Andrews), and Chris Skelton (Marshall Lancaster) are back. Each character grows tremendously as the series progresses. They are another reason you don't want to miss ""Ashes to Ashes."" And the music is also great, though towards the end of Series 3, some pretty soppy stuff is inflicted, another departure from the cool of ""Life on Mars."" Just because there was some insipid music in the early 80s doesn't mean we have to hear it. A highlight in Series 1 is a piece from Visage,Fade to Grey.Series 2, set in 1982, has the Falklands War as a disturbing note. Gene Hunt confronts a growing web of corruption with the police force, while Alex contacts a disturbing man named Martin Summers who claims to know that she is from the future. He says he is another patient in the same hospital she is lying comatose in. Martin Summer's menace grows throughout Series 2, he seems to pose a physical threat to Alex both in the past and present.By Series 3, Alex finds herself disoriented and out of touch in 2008, missing her colleagues from 1981 more than she anticipated. She becomes confused about whether she is in 2008, or back in 1983, in hospital in a coma in the past. This narrative is superbly done. After she awakes, unfortunately, the horrible Jim Keats (Daniel Mays) is a thorn in everyone's side (including viewers). Supposedly, he is a discipline and complaints officer. There are too many indulgent close-ups of his jeering, wet-lipped laughter. And later on, his snarling and barking is over-the top. We want Gene Hunt to rid us of this weasel, but inexplicably, he does not. Series 3 finally explores who Gene Hunt really is, while Drake's suspicions about him mount. She finds herself increasingly haunted by a dead young policeman, a tragic apparition that she wants to help. Drake is oddly demure now, while Chris and Ray are given great story-lines and real focus. Watch for Philip Glenister's real-life wife Beth Goddard, as a fulsome broad with a dating-agency. She is perfection in her role as a woman trying to run a dating-business in 1983, who seems to appreciate Gene's honesty about what he really wants from women. The final episode brings together all the mystery of ""Life On Mars/Ashes to Ashes,"" while not over-explaining things. Overall, this series is definitely worth viewing. Break out Gene Hunt's favorite tea biscuitsGaribaldis, or a pint ofNewcastle Brown Ale, as happily, even The Railway Arms, with its great bartender, returns from Manchester.",5,"Starry, Starry Night:

The police procedural aspects are only the skeleton supporting the impossible-to-describe brilliance of Gene Hunt (the incomparable Philip Glenister), an array of unforgettable supporting characters, and the best example of a mismatched couple endlessly at odds yet absolutely meant for each other that I can recall on screen. It's all here: the erotic tension, the mutual bafflement and frustration, the bad timing, but also moments of astonishing tenderness and understanding. Pay close attention, because that tenderness isn't just between Gene and Alex, and it isn't just romance or even male bonding, but the thread that turns a story of ""trying to get home"" into something cosmic. There is something deep at stake here, and it isn't catching the bad guys. Sometimes bad guys die well. At least one good person dies badly.

Meanwhile, the original writers decided to do a kind of follow-up series named after another David Bowie song and set in yet another nostalgia-laden decade: they called it ""Ashes to Ashes."">>>IMPORTANT -- PLEASE NOTE: Before I discuss the show itself, two pointers: 1) Even now, as of Feb 2012, this show is STILL only on Region 2 (UK) DVD, so you'll need a region 2 or multi-region player to play currently sold DVD sets of this show. 2) [E1]'s packaging is utter crap, using the ""loosely-pile-the-discs"" method, leaving the discs prone to falling about and getting scratched up to no end; compare this to Acorn's responsible and secure packaging for ""Life on Mars.""Ashes to Ashes (2008-10; 24 episodes -- 8x3) is the story of modern DI Alex Drake, who's been looking into the curious case of DI Sam Tyler (from the previous series ""Life on Mars""). She's driving her daughter to school one day, and foolhardily decides to stop and investigate a mad gunman incident, getting shot for her troubles. She wakes up in 1981, and before long, most of the ""LoM"" gang show up-- Gene Hunt, Ray Carling, Chris Skelton, and newcomers Shaz and Viv.Each season set in a different year ('81,'82,'83). Drake has to solve crimes, fight the system, and face the challenge of working with Gene Hunt. Each season also has a different over-arching challenge and set of guest characters, as she tries to find a way home, to figure out what's really going on, and what happened to Sam Tyler.Unfortunately, Drake tends to suffer a lot (even well into year 2!) from Sam Beckett (""Quantum Leap"") syndrome, randomly spouting nonsense about the future, thus giving her game away to criminals, or giving her colleagues reason to not take her seriously or to wonder about her mental health. This is a really irritating character flaw, especially when it keeps going on and on well after you'd have thought she'd get over it already. And she has an arrogance and an emotional streak which sometimes feels over-the-top. I'd go on about Drake's character flaws, and maybe even psycho-analyze some of the other main characters, but if I feel compelled to do all that, then the writers must be doing something right. Generally, though, ""Bolls"" is a good character, and she *does* improve with time.Like ""LoM"", ""A2A"" has an ensemble cast of engaging characters, gritty crime drama, snappy dialogue, humor, pop culture references, immersion in British culture, history, and politics; a thorough period soundtrack of songs, and surreal lapses of reality around the mystery of the protagonist's situation, only this time in the '80s.Once in a while, a few songs are repeated (but only once each) in the course of the series. Also, the composer tends to dangerously lean on some of his best cues, using them many times in the series.I'd say more, but they'd be plot-related details, and the show has plenty of engaging storylines and some nice twists and (semi)surprises along the way. Although it threatens to falter or lose its way sometimes, this show always recovers and comes up with more good stuff to make up for it.The case has a blurb saying this is better than ""Life on Mars;"" I don't agree, but it's almost as good, with great cliffhangers and a decent enough wrap-up.",3,Back to the Future with Gene Hunt & Co,1330214400,"02 26, 2012",2012,3489,"['UK', '~cop', 'show~', 'Life', 'Mars', 'was', 'so', 'popular', 'US', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'ripping', 'off', 'Hint', 'Watch', 'original', 'UK', 'version', '[', 'see', 'review', 'detailsLife', 'Mars', 'Complete', 'Collection', 'U.K.', ']', '-as', 'most', 're-makes-', 'avoid', 'US', 'version', 'Meanwhile', 'original', 'writers', 'decided', 'do', 'kind', 'follow-up', 'series', 'named', 'David', 'Bowie', 'song', 'set', 'yet', 'nostalgia-laden', 'decade', 'called', 'Ashes', 'Ashes', '>', '>', '>', 'IMPORTANT', 'PLEASE', 'NOTE', 'discuss', 'show', 'two', 'pointers', '1', 'Even', 'now', 'Feb', '2012', 'show', 'STILL', 'only', 'Region', '2', 'UK', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'need', 'region', '2', 'multi-region', 'player', 'play', 'currently', 'sold', 'DVD', 'sets', 'show', '2', '[', 'E1', ']', 'packaging', 'utter', 'crap', 'using', 'loosely-pile-the-discs', 'method', 'leaving', 'discs', 'prone', 'falling', 'about', 'getting', 'scratched', 'up', 'end', 'compare', 'Acorn', 'responsible', 'secure', 'packaging', 'Life', 'Mars', 'Ashes', 'Ashes', '2008-10', '24', 'episodes', '8x3', 'story', 'modern', 'DI', 'Alex', 'Drake', 'who', 'been', 'looking', 'curious', 'case', 'DI', 'Sam', 'Tyler', 'previous', 'series', 'Life', 'Mars', 'driving', 'daughter', 'school', 'one', 'day', 'foolhardily', 'decides', 'stop', 'investigate', 'mad', 'gunman', 'incident', 'getting', 'shot', 'troubles', 'up', '1981', 'long', 'most', 'LoM', 'gang', 'show', 'up', 'Gene', 'Hunt', 'Ray', 'Carling', 'Chris', 'Skelton', 'newcomers', 'Shaz', 'Viv.Each', 'season', 'set', 'different', 'year', ""'81"", ""'82"", 'Drake', 'solve', 'crimes', 'fight', 'system', 'face', 'challenge', 'working', 'Gene', 'Hunt', 'season', 'also', 'different', 'over-arching', 'challenge', 'set', 'guest', 'characters', 'find', 'way', 'home', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'what', 'happened', 'Sam', 'Tyler.Unfortunately', 'Drake', 'suffer', 'lot', 'even', 'well', 'year', '2', 'Sam', 'Beckett', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'syndrome', 'randomly', 'spouting', 'nonsense', 'future', 'thus', 'giving', 'game', 'away', 'criminals', 'giving', 'colleagues', 'reason', 'not', 'take', 'seriously', 'wonder', 'mental', 'health', 'really', 'irritating', 'character', 'flaw', 'especially', 'when', 'going', 'well', ""'d"", 'have', 'thought', ""'d"", 'get', 'already', 'arrogance', 'emotional', 'streak', 'sometimes', 'over-the-top', ""'d"", 'go', 'Drake', 'character', 'flaws', 'maybe', 'even', 'psycho-analyze', 'other', 'main', 'characters', 'feel', 'compelled', 'do', 'then', 'writers', 'must', 'be', 'doing', 'something', 'right', 'Generally', 'though', 'Bolls', 'good', 'character', '*does*', 'improve', 'time.Like', 'LoM', 'A2A', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'engaging', 'characters', 'gritty', 'crime', 'drama', 'snappy', 'dialogue', 'humor', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'immersion', 'British', 'culture', 'history', 'politics', 'thorough', 'period', 'soundtrack', 'songs', 'surreal', 'lapses', 'reality', 'mystery', 'protagonist', 'situation', 'only', 'time', ""'80s.Once"", 'while', 'few', 'songs', 'are', 'repeated', 'only', 'once', 'course', 'series', 'Also', 'composer', 'dangerously', 'lean', 'best', 'cues', 'using', 'many', 'times', 'series.I', ""'d"", 'say', 'more', ""'d"", 'be', 'plot-related', 'details', 'show', 'plenty', 'engaging', 'storylines', 'nice', 'twists', 'semi', 'way', 'falter', 'lose', 'way', 'sometimes', 'show', 'always', 'recovers', 'up', 'more', 'good', 'stuff', 'make', 'up', 'it.The', 'case', 'blurb', 'saying', 'better', 'Life', 'Mars', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'great', 'cliffhangers', 'decent', 'enough', 'wrap-up']",N/A
