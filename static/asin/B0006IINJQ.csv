And I would contend the we are better off today for them!The DVD attempts to incorrectly connect NAZI's and ""Illuminati"" and other ""Secret Societies"" (i.e. Freemasons and Templers). The only connection is they are exact opposites in their political beliefs. There is a very strong link to the ""Thule Society""(Germanic Teutonic wantabees) on the other hand which the DVD Producers completely overlooked.From there the Producers try to create a Conspiracy involing the Soviet KGB,GRU and western ""Illuminati"".

868604,A3PR4ZSBDUL4EG,B0006IINJQ,"Matthew S. Schweitzer ""zohoe""","[42, 53]","""Angels and Demons Revealed"" is a bit misleading.  This documentary goes into great detail regarding the historical background of several prominent secret societies that have appeared and disappeared throughout history including the Illuminati, Freemasons, The Knights Templar, the Assassins, and the Priory of Sion.  These secret brotherhoods have often been credited with, or accused of, working behind the scenes of international affairs to influence the course of human history.  The evidence for this, however, is often slim and ellusive.The biggest problem with this documentary, however, is that it really has nothing at all to do with the book ""Angels and Demons"" by Dan Brown other than it deals with the history of the Illuminati and the Knights Templar.  Both of these groups were very real, but the film puts a hugely biased slant on the story, choosing to portray them as evil underground organizations working to enslave mankind.  It makes no mention of the fact that the Illuminati were themselves created in the late 18th century to promote knowledge and reason over church dominated superstition which had hindered these very Enlightenment virtues. And like the Illuminati, the Prior of Sion, if it ever truly existed, was alledged to have worked toward a similar and laudable goal.  Hence it is reputed to have attracted the leading and most promising minds of their day:  Issac Newton, Leonardo Da Vinci, Francis Bacon, and Benjamin Franklin.  Whether or not the Priory ever actually existed is open to debate and the evidence is not encouraging.  The film, however, makes great efforts to link these groups together and to paint them as part of a diabolical plan to create the dreaded New World Order. Would such men as Franklin, Hugo, and Debussy really work to create a sinister and opressive world regime?  Questionable at best.This documentary is interesting for its portrayals of the various secret societies that it investigates, but many of its conclusions are seemingly biased and highly questionable.  It also, disappointingly, had little to do with the highly enjoyable novel that it purports to ""reveal"".",3,"Interesting, But...",1114387200,"04 25, 2005",2005,2135,"['Angels', 'Demons', 'Revealed', 'bit', 'misleading', 'documentary', 'great', 'detail', 'regarding', 'historical', 'background', 'several', 'prominent', 'secret', 'societies', 'have', 'appeared', 'disappeared', 'history', 'including', 'Illuminati', 'Freemasons', 'Knights', 'Templar', 'Assassins', 'Priory', 'Sion', 'secret', 'brotherhoods', 'have', 'often', 'been', 'credited', 'accused', 'working', 'scenes', 'international', 'affairs', 'influence', 'course', 'human', 'history', 'evidence', 'however', 'often', 'slim', 'ellusive.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'documentary', 'however', 'really', 'nothing', 'do', 'book', 'Angels', 'Demons', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'other', 'history', 'Illuminati', 'Knights', 'Templar', 'groups', 'were', 'very', 'real', 'film', 'hugely', 'biased', 'slant', 'story', 'choosing', 'portray', 'evil', 'organizations', 'working', 'enslave', 'mankind', 'mention', 'fact', 'Illuminati', 'were', 'created', 'late', '18th', 'century', 'promote', 'knowledge', 'reason', 'church', 'dominated', 'superstition', 'had', 'hindered', 'very', 'Enlightenment', 'virtues', 'Illuminati', 'Prior', 'Sion', 'ever', 'truly', 'existed', 'was', 'alledged', 'have', 'worked', 'similar', 'laudable', 'goal', 'Hence', 'reputed', 'have', 'attracted', 'leading', 'most', 'promising', 'minds', 'day', 'Issac', 'Newton', 'Leonardo', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Francis', 'Bacon', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'Whether', 'not', 'Priory', 'ever', 'actually', 'existed', 'open', 'debate', 'evidence', 'not', 'encouraging', 'film', 'however', 'great', 'efforts', 'link', 'groups', 'together', 'paint', 'part', 'diabolical', 'plan', 'create', 'dreaded', 'New', 'World', 'Order', 'Would', 'such', 'men', 'Franklin', 'Hugo', 'Debussy', 'really', 'work', 'create', 'sinister', 'opressive', 'world', 'regime', 'Questionable', 'best.This', 'documentary', 'interesting', 'portrayals', 'various', 'secret', 'societies', 'many', 'conclusions', 'are', 'seemingly', 'biased', 'highly', 'questionable', 'also', 'disappointingly', 'had', 'little', 'do', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'novel', 'reveal']",N/A
