919200,A2IWPUK181NIA,B000A2UCI8,"Cody Shay ""Big Yami No Matsuei Fan..""","[4, 4]","Season 1 of Orphen was simply excellent.  There was a great plot, excellent animation for the time, and very likable characters.  The only downside was the slightly Americanized dub.  It was originally planned for a TV run that never materialized.  However, the dub remains more faithful to the Japanese script after a few episodes.Season 2 starts out very weak, in just about every department.  The animation seems cheap at times, and the music is just not as good as season 1.  Even the first OP of season 2 is pretty bad.  However, the show does start to improve after several episodes, and towards the end of Season 2 it becomes some of what made Season 1 so great.  The animation and music also improve dramatically as well.ADV and Sentai gave the show a nice release here, with all the original extras intact.  It includes several recording session out takes, which are hilarious.  David Mantragna's and Hillary Haag's are especially good.  It also includes a lot of excellent artwork on the slip covers and two enclosed DVD packs.If you're interested in this show at all, this is the best way to get it, as Season 1 has been out of print for sometime now.  I really recommend this for lovers of fantasy anime.",4,A Very Solid Release,1265846400,"02 11, 2010",2010,1216,"['Season', '1', 'Orphen', 'was', 'simply', 'excellent', 'was', 'great', 'plot', 'excellent', 'animation', 'time', 'very', 'likable', 'characters', 'only', 'downside', 'was', 'slightly', 'Americanized', 'dub', 'was', 'originally', 'planned', 'TV', 'run', 'never', 'materialized', 'However', 'dub', 'more', 'faithful', 'Japanese', 'script', 'few', 'episodes.Season', '2', 'out', 'very', 'weak', 'just', 'department', 'animation', 'cheap', 'times', 'music', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'season', '1', 'Even', 'first', 'OP', 'season', '2', 'pretty', 'bad', 'However', 'show', 'start', 'improve', 'several', 'episodes', 'end', 'Season', '2', 'what', 'made', 'Season', '1', 'so', 'great', 'animation', 'music', 'also', 'improve', 'dramatically', 'well.ADV', 'Sentai', 'gave', 'show', 'nice', 'release', 'here', 'original', 'extras', 'intact', 'several', 'recording', 'session', 'are', 'hilarious', 'David', 'Mantragna', 'Hillary', 'Haag', 'are', 'especially', 'good', 'also', 'lot', 'excellent', 'artwork', 'slip', 'two', 'enclosed', 'DVD', 'packs.If', ""'re"", 'interested', 'show', 'best', 'way', 'get', 'Season', '1', 'been', 'print', 'sometime', 'now', 'really', 'recommend', 'lovers', 'fantasy', 'anime']",N/A
919201,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B000A2UCI8,maskedgamer,"[0, 1]","For a series that I genuinely liked because it showed so much promise. Season 2 is so different from Season 1 that it's barely the same anime. This is basically the Fumoffu (see Full Metal Panic) of the Orphen series. There isn't really a story to even follow it's just the team from the last series traveling around and getting into Dennis the menace type of trouble. It could still be fun because I liked all the characters but they added in a new 4th wheel called Licorice who is voiced by Luci Christian. Yes, Luci Christian 1 of 2 female voice actors in North America. At least you think of it that way because Funimation uses her voice for young female characters IN EVERY ANIME EVER CREATED! The only other female voice actor in North America is Laura Bailey. Together these 2 make up 100% of female voice actors because they are in EVERYTHING! and it gets old there are other female voice actors out there USE THEM!I was very happy to first pick this series up because I got fresh voices I hadn't heard and I liked it. Then Season 2 comes and it's Luci Christian and her character never shuts up! What I don't like about Season 2 is that there really is no need for character. They already have Majic as the klutz and Cleo as the bimbo so having Licorice around is like having both those 2 characters in 1 character and it shows. Her parts just over shadow everything Cleo and magic do. It really takes away from them. The other thing about Season 2 is the art design. It's a mix mash of the old series and the newer direction of anime for that period but Leki really got screwed. He went from being drawn as a wolf to a cat that's far from Garfield.This season was really a let down because Season 1 was so great and so mature. Get it if you want to see the Orphen gang fooling around but other than that it doesn't add anything to the story at all.",3,This hurts to rate it so low.,1301097600,"03 26, 2011",2011,1858,"['series', 'genuinely', 'liked', 'showed', 'so', 'much', 'promise', 'Season', '2', 'so', 'different', 'Season', '1', 'barely', 'same', 'anime', 'basically', 'Fumoffu', 'see', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Panic', 'Orphen', 'series', ""n't"", 'really', 'story', 'even', 'follow', 'just', 'team', 'last', 'series', 'traveling', 'getting', 'Dennis', 'menace', 'type', 'trouble', 'could', 'still', 'be', 'fun', 'liked', 'characters', 'added', 'new', '4th', 'wheel', 'called', 'Licorice', 'who', 'voiced', 'Luci', 'Christian', 'Yes', 'Luci', 'Christian', '1', '2', 'female', 'voice', 'actors', 'North', 'America', 'least', 'think', 'way', 'Funimation', 'voice', 'young', 'female', 'characters', 'IN', 'EVERY', 'ANIME', 'EVER', 'CREATED', 'only', 'other', 'female', 'voice', 'actor', 'North', 'America', 'Laura', 'Bailey', 'Together', '2', 'make', 'up', '100', '%', 'female', 'voice', 'actors', 'are', 'EVERYTHING', 'old', 'are', 'other', 'female', 'voice', 'actors', 'out', 'there', 'USE', 'THEM', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'first', 'pick', 'series', 'got', 'fresh', 'voices', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'liked', 'Then', 'Season', '2', 'Luci', 'Christian', 'character', 'never', 'up', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Season', '2', 'really', 'need', 'character', 'already', 'have', 'Majic', 'klutz', 'Cleo', 'bimbo', 'so', 'having', 'Licorice', 'around', 'having', '2', 'characters', '1', 'character', 'parts', 'just', 'shadow', 'everything', 'Cleo', 'magic', 'do', 'really', 'away', 'other', 'thing', 'Season', '2', 'art', 'design', 'mix', 'mash', 'old', 'series', 'newer', 'direction', 'anime', 'period', 'Leki', 'really', 'got', 'screwed', 'went', 'being', 'drawn', 'wolf', 'cat', 'far', 'Garfield.This', 'season', 'was', 'really', 'let', 'down', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'so', 'mature', 'Get', 'want', 'see', 'Orphen', 'gang', 'fooling', 'around', 'other', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'story']",N/A
919202,A1C7BWPATO40VA,B000A2UCI8,Nathan T.,"[13, 16]","I watched over 100 series of anime so this is coming from someone that watches anime rather than TV because TV just sucks nowadays. Anyhow there's two seasons to this anime. I'm just gonna go straight to analyzing it. If you wanna know what the anime is about than check out the intro on Amazon or search it on google.There are two seasons to this anime. Season 1 is orphen and season 2 is orphen revenge. Season 1 has 24 episodes and season 2 has 23.The first season is actually significantly better and more humorous (better quality humor) than the second. It has a better storyline and was a bit more unique and a lot more interesting. The second season, however, starts off horribly and starts picking up a few episodes later. However, the second season never reaches the same quality as the first season hence me giving this a 3 star.To the person that gave it a 1 star, this anime in no way deserves a one star. It was pretty good, the dub was nice to watch and the characters were very funny and decently built. I only agree with the second season that it did lack what was found in the first.First season I would give about a 3.5-4 star and the second season I would give about a 2 because it had a lot of stuff missing. Did anyone notice that they also lowered the quality to the animation as well? Check out LUCKY, the wolfen. You'll notice it there the most.Is this anime worth watching? Yeah! It was actually entertaining compare with other animes that I've watched. Here's a quick recommendation from me if you're interested in anime!-NARUTO (Subtitles)-Code Geass (SUBtitles)-Death Note (SUB)-Get Backers (DUB)-Desert Punk (DUB)These are all unrelated animes since I don't really know many animes that are similar to orphen, at least not one that I can think of that's good at the moment, especially that feels like orphen.EDITI just thought up of an anime that is somewhat similar that many people should know and it's Full Metal Alchemist (subtitle version for best experience, but their dub version isn't too shabby). Read about it, it's not exactly sorcery imo but yeah.Want anymore recommendations? Leave a comment and hopefully I'll see it and tell ya.",3,2 Season Anime.

919203,A3FIKATQ286DMV,B000A2UCI8,Niko,"[21, 21]","Well, I will try to give a review as best as possible without spoiling it because I am also the first one to write a review about this show.To begin with, the pattern of the storyline is similar to Orphen of the first season. As the story unfolds, people get the impression that the story is straightforward, me included. Surprisingly good, this is not the case because after a point in the anime the story unfolds not just forwards, but backwards as well, putting the pieces together with a lot of action, fun, love story, drama etc. Overall, the story was funny, dramatic, emotional and very interesting plus dark.A few words about the story (SPOILERS INCLUDED!!!)Before beginning with the story, I would like to apologize if I misspell or do not remember a few names correct.Now to the story, it starts that Orphen, Clio and Magic, start for an adventure and through the episodes they encounter various monsters that are aiming for some reason to kill Orphen. At first it seems that a guy called Flamesoul (the brother of Flameheart) is seeking revenge. Additionally, they meet a young girl named Lucrice which claims that she belongs to a royal knighthood that wants to honour Orphen. Clumsy as she may seem she becomes best friends with Clio, and their bounds become so strong that they consider each other as sisters (which will play a great deal later in the episodes). Moreover, we will see that new magicians of the Tower of Fang (Magicians guilt) try to help Orphen.Additional Facts about the story:- After episode 12, Orphen is dealing with a Magician named McGregor, and viewers get the impression that Orphen, as strong as he is, he seems in front of him like a Rookie.- Magic's girlfriend, is now something like a master in the Tower of Fang, who tries to help them, with the aid of Orphen's friend and Professor in the Guilt to solve the mystery, plus the love story between her and Magic evolves through the episodes- The Trolls  appear in the episodes and give a funny tone to the shows, especially when something like that is needed in the later episodes- Magic becomes strong in magic- Magic will be put into temptation to leave Orphen to study by someone else's side- Magic and Orphen will fight against each other to ""death""- Clio in order to protect the ones she loves will mature and fight light crazy-  Lucrice will try to sacrifice herself to protect the ones she loves as well- Orphen, as easygoing at the beginning as he may seem, he will show in the later episodes his true self- After episode 18, the shows get really emotional. People die for the ones they love, fights till death and so forth- After episode 15, the story gets really dark, and most of all you may think that you have figure it out but trust me in that: Until the last episode you will have figured out nothing- Until episode 9, people get only a few clues of what is really going on. But be reassured that the peaces come together and the suspense is increasing constantly as the episodes continue- You will see that a woman plays the piano in the middle of nowhere, Orphen and she kiss (lovy dowy stuff) and you may ask yourself what the heck is her part in the story. Which will proof in later episodes that she is one of the main figures.Is the money worth of buying it?I will be honest. Until episode 9 to 10, the story gets 3 to 3.5. Therefore, only people who really fell in love with the Masterpiece of Orphen first season should buy it.When watching the show up to episode 14 to 15 the show would get 4 stars. Therefore, it is worth the money. Weird as it may sound that the show could change in only three episodes, however it is true because they are.Last but not least, after watching the entire show the show gets 5 starts straight and is truly a masterpiece. Therefore, you can buy the show without regretting the money you have invested in it, because it is worth it.The average of above is what made me give it 4 stars.You see, people who watch the shows, will get the impression that after episode 11, it feels as if someone else took over the show, and all of a sudden from a light hearted show the show gets really, and I mean really good, the animation and storyline become superb and so forth. Take this into consideration, after episode 12 the show becomes even darker than Orphen of the first season, more emotional and you will not get enough of it.To sum up, I hope that I could give you an inside of the story without giving too much away and overall, it is worth buying it. Because, as stated previously, after episode 12 the show becomes truly superb.",4,COULD BE FIVE STARS BUT....,1136851200,"01 10, 2006",2006,4576,"['Well', 'will', 'try', 'give', 'review', 'as', 'best', 'possible', 'spoiling', 'am', 'also', 'first', 'one', 'write', 'review', 'show.To', 'begin', 'pattern', 'storyline', 'similar', 'Orphen', 'first', 'season', 'story', 'unfolds', 'people', 'get', 'impression', 'story', 'straightforward', 'included', 'Surprisingly', 'good', 'not', 'case', 'point', 'anime', 'story', 'not', 'just', 'forwards', 'backwards', 'as', 'well', 'putting', 'pieces', 'together', 'lot', 'action', 'fun', 'love', 'story', 'drama', 'etc', 'Overall', 'story', 'was', 'funny', 'dramatic', 'emotional', 'very', 'interesting', 'dark.A', 'few', 'words', 'story', 'SPOILERS', 'INCLUDED', 'beginning', 'story', 'would', 'like', 'apologize', 'misspell', 'do', 'not', 'remember', 'few', 'names', 'correct.Now', 'story', 'Orphen', 'Clio', 'Magic', 'start', 'adventure', 'episodes', 'encounter', 'various', 'monsters', 'are', 'aiming', 'reason', 'kill', 'Orphen', 'first', 'guy', 'called', 'Flamesoul', 'brother', 'Flameheart', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'Additionally', 'meet', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Lucrice', 'royal', 'knighthood', 'honour', 'Orphen', 'Clumsy', 'may', 'seem', 'best', 'friends', 'Clio', 'bounds', 'become', 'so', 'strong', 'consider', 'other', 'sisters', 'will', 'play', 'great', 'deal', 'later', 'episodes', 'Moreover', 'will', 'see', 'new', 'magicians', 'Tower', 'Fang', 'Magicians', 'guilt', 'try', 'help', 'Orphen.Additional', 'Facts', 'story', 'episode', '12', 'Orphen', 'dealing', 'Magician', 'named', 'McGregor', 'viewers', 'get', 'impression', 'Orphen', 'as', 'strong', 'front', 'Rookie.-', 'Magic', 'girlfriend', 'now', 'something', 'master', 'Tower', 'Fang', 'who', 'help', 'aid', 'Orphen', 'friend', 'Professor', 'Guilt', 'solve', 'mystery', 'love', 'story', 'Magic', 'episodes-', 'Trolls', 'appear', 'episodes', 'give', 'funny', 'tone', 'shows', 'especially', 'when', 'something', 'needed', 'later', 'episodes-', 'Magic', 'strong', 'magic-', 'Magic', 'will', 'be', 'put', 'temptation', 'leave', 'Orphen', 'study', 'someone', 'else', 'side-', 'Magic', 'Orphen', 'will', 'fight', 'other', 'death', 'Clio', 'order', 'protect', 'ones', 'will', 'mature', 'fight', 'light', 'crazy-', 'Lucrice', 'will', 'try', 'sacrifice', 'protect', 'ones', 'well-', 'Orphen', 'easygoing', 'beginning', 'may', 'seem', 'will', 'show', 'later', 'true', 'self-', 'episode', '18', 'shows', 'get', 'really', 'emotional', 'People', 'die', 'ones', 'love', 'fights', 'till', 'death', 'so', 'forth-', 'episode', '15', 'story', 'really', 'dark', 'most', 'may', 'think', 'have', 'figure', 'out', 'trust', 'last', 'episode', 'will', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'nothing-', 'episode', '9', 'people', 'get', 'only', 'few', 'clues', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'be', 'reassured', 'peaces', 'come', 'together', 'suspense', 'increasing', 'constantly', 'episodes', 'continue-', 'will', 'see', 'woman', 'piano', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'Orphen', 'kiss', 'lovy', 'dowy', 'stuff', 'may', 'ask', 'what', 'heck', 'part', 'story', 'will', 'proof', 'later', 'episodes', 'one', 'main', 'figures.Is', 'money', 'worth', 'buying', 'will', 'be', 'honest', 'episode', '9', '10', 'story', '3', '3.5', 'Therefore', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'fell', 'love', 'Masterpiece', 'Orphen', 'first', 'season', 'should', 'buy', 'watching', 'show', 'up', 'episode', '14', '15', 'show', 'would', 'get', '4', 'stars', 'Therefore', 'money', 'may', 'sound', 'show', 'could', 'change', 'only', 'three', 'episodes', 'however', 'true', 'are.Last', 'not', 'least', 'watching', 'entire', 'show', 'show', '5', 'starts', 'straight', 'truly', 'masterpiece', 'Therefore', 'can', 'buy', 'show', 'regretting', 'money', 'have', 'invested', 'worth', 'it.The', 'average', 'above', 'what', 'made', 'give', '4', 'stars.You', 'see', 'people', 'who', 'watch', 'shows', 'will', 'get', 'impression', 'episode', '11', 'someone', 'else', 'took', 'show', 'sudden', 'light', 'hearted', 'show', 'show', 'really', 'mean', 'really', 'good', 'animation', 'storyline', 'become', 'superb', 'so', 'forth', 'Take', 'consideration', 'episode', '12', 'show', 'even', 'darker', 'Orphen', 'first', 'season', 'more', 'emotional', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'enough', 'it.To', 'sum', 'up', 'hope', 'could', 'give', 'inside', 'story', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'overall', 'worth', 'buying', 'stated', 'previously', 'episode', '12', 'show', 'truly', 'superb']",N/A
919204,AFV2584U13XP3,B000A2UCI8,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[10, 11]","I had already gotten the second season of this entertaining anime and was finding it difficult to get the first season, and now I'm glad that ADV has finally released this series together for a very good price. Some fans have complained that the second season was to light and not as serious as the first and while that's a little true both seasons are still entertaining either way so you'll get enjoyment from both seasons.  The first season deals with the main character Oprhen and his recent his agreement to have an apprentice by the name of Majic who's the innkeepers son, but he has his own hidden agenda as well for being in this village that no one knows about.  AS he trains Majic in the ways of spells we later find out of his own estrangement from the wizard council also known as the Tower Of Fang which all powerful wizards belong to and which Orphen himself is especially known for because of his own great power, along the way he meets another would be student by the name of Cleao  a young upper class women who saw Orphen during her travels while abroad and was instantly smitten with him.  The second season is as many fans have said mostly light-hearted for half the season but it does become more dramatic during the other half and we will see recurring characters you may have seen from the first season most notably Dortin and Volkan the brothers who are basically the comedic duo for both the first and second season. You'll definitely like Orphen's somewhat laid back an smarmy attitude he gives out sometimes which he does to basically hide his own caring and kind heart that he allows only a select few to see,  the Japanese voice cast were of course excellent and the English cast were just as good especially the voice of Orphen as the lines they give him for the dubbed make Orphen an even more endearing and smart mouth wizard character than they do with the subbed version.  The video for the first season is decent but you will see some lines from time to time, but the second season video is more cleared up so all in all no complaints really on that part.  The audio for both seasons is very good and the music soundtrack they have fit with the series greatly so if you're a fan of series like Scrapped Princess, Rune Soldier, or Full Metal Alchemist here's another great box set for your anime library.....",5,If You Like Anime With A Witty Wizard With An Attitude Here's A Great One For You,1250640000,"08 19, 2009",2009,2342,"['had', 'already', 'gotten', 'second', 'season', 'entertaining', 'anime', 'was', 'finding', 'difficult', 'get', 'first', 'season', 'now', ""'m"", 'glad', 'ADV', 'finally', 'released', 'series', 'together', 'very', 'good', 'price', 'fans', 'have', 'complained', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'light', 'not', 'as', 'serious', 'first', 'little', 'true', 'seasons', 'are', 'still', 'entertaining', 'way', ""'ll"", 'get', 'enjoyment', 'seasons', 'first', 'season', 'deals', 'main', 'character', 'Oprhen', 'recent', 'agreement', 'have', 'apprentice', 'name', 'Majic', 'who', 'innkeepers', 'son', 'own', 'hidden', 'agenda', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'village', 'one', 'about', 'Majic', 'ways', 'spells', 'later', 'find', 'own', 'estrangement', 'wizard', 'council', 'also', 'known', 'Tower', 'Fang', 'powerful', 'wizards', 'belong', 'Orphen', 'especially', 'known', 'own', 'great', 'power', 'way', 'would', 'be', 'student', 'name', 'Cleao', 'young', 'upper', 'class', 'women', 'who', 'saw', 'Orphen', 'travels', 'abroad', 'was', 'instantly', 'smitten', 'second', 'season', 'as', 'many', 'fans', 'have', 'said', 'mostly', 'light-hearted', 'season', 'become', 'more', 'dramatic', 'other', 'half', 'will', 'see', 'recurring', 'characters', 'may', 'have', 'seen', 'first', 'season', 'most', 'notably', 'Dortin', 'Volkan', 'brothers', 'who', 'are', 'basically', 'comedic', 'duo', 'first', 'second', 'season', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'Orphen', 'somewhat', 'laid', 'back', 'smarmy', 'attitude', 'out', 'sometimes', 'basically', 'hide', 'own', 'caring', 'kind', 'heart', 'only', 'select', 'few', 'see', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'cast', 'were', 'course', 'excellent', 'English', 'cast', 'were', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'especially', 'voice', 'Orphen', 'lines', 'give', 'dubbed', 'make', 'Orphen', 'even', 'more', 'endearing', 'smart', 'mouth', 'character', 'do', 'subbed', 'version', 'video', 'first', 'season', 'decent', 'will', 'see', 'lines', 'time', 'time', 'second', 'season', 'video', 'more', 'cleared', 'up', 'so', 'all', 'complaints', 'really', 'part', 'audio', 'seasons', 'very', 'good', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'have', 'fit', 'series', 'greatly', 'so', ""'re"", 'fan', 'series', 'Scrapped', 'Princess', 'Rune', 'Soldier', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Alchemist', 'here', 'great', 'box', 'set', 'anime', 'library', '..']",N/A
