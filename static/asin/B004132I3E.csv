There are no credits on the screen or the packaging to give you a hint as to who produced this.The portion I saw consisted of a sequence of still images with a vaguely British-accented narrator reading text only loosely related to the images. There is also continuous random background music.But if you're familiar with early aviation, you'll be surprised at the wonderful and knowledgeable selection of photos!Look, at this price you can't go wrong.

The classic footage is fantastic, and much of it even seems a bit restored in it's clarity. The DVD spans the whole gamut of historical flight, from balloons to dirigibles to airplanes, including the invention of the jet engine and how it changed the world. Since this is a history of commercial aviation, do not expect much mention of specific military aircraft. All in all, a very enjoyable 7 hours or so of classic aviation, and very well done.",5,Fantastic documentary with great footage!

1379762,A2JAAUES5NXG4Z,B004132I3E,Glen Boisseau Becker,"[4, 5]","This package actually presents just the first eight episodes of a 13-part Australian TV series, originally called ""The Amazing World of Aviation: Past, Present & Future,"" dating from 2009. Each episode runs about 52 minutes, and for those with a reasonably sustained attention span, it offers plentiful film footage--not previously in widespread circulation--depicting all kinds of aircraft from 1903 through the 1960s.The series does not offer detailed reenactments of the prehistory of powered flight, as in the memorable 1936 movie ""Conquest of the Air."" Far more surprising, it almost completely skips over the role of aircraft in World War II (some of which can be seen in the series ""Victory at Sea,"" also available cheaply from Mill Creek Entertainment). The viewer periodically wonders how the series' creators decided what to include; for instance, Wiley Post is mentioned as the first aviator to make a solo flight around the world, but I don't recall any mention of his tragic death.To be sure, the ""Birth of Flight"" videos do take us well beyond the BIRTH of flight. But given the excision of nearly 50 years of modern aviation history, the title has inevitably been amended to remove the ""present"" and ""future"" of the original series name.In general, the film clips are organized topically rather than in strict chronological sequence; they are at times slightly repetitive, at other times brisk enough that one has to listen carefully to keep the names and dates straight. Fluent narration is provided by Stuart Sykes, who has a Scottish accent but does a creditable job of pronouncing foreign names. Understandably, the visual quality of the film footage--some of it more than 100 years old--is uneven. The background score, played on a synthesizer, is just annoying enough that the occasional insertion of excerpts from newsreels and promotional films with vintage music comes as a relief.Perhaps the most exciting moments come in episode 2, as we view some of the long-ago daredevil stunts known as barnstorming (not ""brainstorming"" as indicated on the back of the package!). Episodes 6, 7, and 8 include an entertaining look at how advertisers and other media sold the public on the idea of commercial air travel, especially during the fifties and early sixties, along with glimpses of the primitive computer systems used for booking flight reservations. In between, the interest level is likely to wane a little, unless you're intrigued by statistics regarding wing structures, engine types, horsepowers, and kilometers per hour.In short, this is a cost-effective opportunity to watch the first eight installments of an unusually detailed documentary series. Real aviation buffs will wish they had acquired all 13 episodes. An audience of nonspecialists, however, might prefer a three- or four-hour reedit, incorporating a bit more focus on the role of airplanes in battle situations (and maybe in early Hollywood movies), along with some insights on more recent developments in air and space travel.",3,A complete history of flight--abridged,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,3019,"['package', 'actually', 'just', 'first', 'eight', 'episodes', '13-part', 'Australian', 'TV', 'series', 'originally', 'called', 'Amazing', 'World', 'Aviation', 'Past', 'Present', 'Future', 'dating', '2009', 'episode', '52', 'minutes', 'reasonably', 'sustained', 'attention', 'span', 'plentiful', 'film', 'footage', 'not', 'previously', 'widespread', 'circulation', 'depicting', 'kinds', 'aircraft', '1903', '1960s.The', 'series', 'not', 'offer', 'detailed', 'reenactments', 'prehistory', 'powered', 'flight', 'memorable', '1936', 'movie', 'Conquest', 'Air', 'Far', 'more', 'surprising', 'almost', 'completely', 'role', 'aircraft', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'series', 'Victory', 'Sea', 'also', 'available', 'cheaply', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'Entertainment', 'viewer', 'periodically', 'how', 'series', 'creators', 'decided', 'what', 'include', 'instance', 'Wiley', 'Post', 'mentioned', 'first', 'aviator', 'make', 'solo', 'flight', 'world', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'mention', 'tragic', 'death.To', 'be', 'sure', 'Birth', 'Flight', 'videos', 'do', 'take', 'well', 'BIRTH', 'flight', 'given', 'excision', 'nearly', '50', 'years', 'modern', 'aviation', 'history', 'title', 'inevitably', 'been', 'amended', 'remove', 'present', 'future', 'original', 'series', 'general', 'film', 'clips', 'are', 'organized', 'topically', 'rather', 'strict', 'chronological', 'sequence', 'are', 'times', 'slightly', 'repetitive', 'other', 'times', 'brisk', 'enough', 'one', 'listen', 'carefully', 'keep', 'names', 'dates', 'straight', 'Fluent', 'narration', 'provided', 'Stuart', 'Sykes', 'who', 'Scottish', 'accent', 'creditable', 'job', 'pronouncing', 'foreign', 'names', 'Understandably', 'visual', 'quality', 'film', 'footage', 'more', '100', 'years', 'old', 'uneven', 'background', 'score', 'played', 'synthesizer', 'just', 'annoying', 'enough', 'occasional', 'insertion', 'excerpts', 'newsreels', 'promotional', 'films', 'vintage', 'music', 'most', 'exciting', 'moments', 'come', 'episode', '2', 'view', 'long-ago', 'daredevil', 'stunts', 'known', 'barnstorming', 'not', 'brainstorming', 'indicated', 'back', 'package', '6', '7', '8', 'include', 'entertaining', 'look', 'how', 'advertisers', 'other', 'media', 'sold', 'public', 'idea', 'commercial', 'air', 'travel', 'especially', 'fifties', 'early', 'sixties', 'glimpses', 'primitive', 'computer', 'systems', 'used', 'booking', 'flight', 'reservations', 'interest', 'level', 'likely', 'wane', 'little', ""'re"", 'intrigued', 'statistics', 'regarding', 'wing', 'structures', 'engine', 'types', 'horsepowers', 'kilometers', 'hour.In', 'short', 'cost-effective', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'first', 'eight', 'installments', 'unusually', 'detailed', 'documentary', 'series', 'Real', 'aviation', 'buffs', 'will', 'wish', 'had', 'acquired', 'all', '13', 'episodes', 'audience', 'nonspecialists', 'however', 'might', 'prefer', 'three-', 'four-hour', 'reedit', 'incorporating', 'bit', 'more', 'focus', 'role', 'airplanes', 'battle', 'situations', 'maybe', 'early', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'insights', 'more', 'recent', 'developments', 'air', 'space', 'travel']",N/A

1379764,A1LVHR5OO45L5V,B004132I3E,JAG 2.0,"[1, 2]","This product contains three discs with eight segments on various topics on commercial aviation from the birth of flight to the jet age.The series begins with the birth of flight and covers lighter-than-air craft in the form of the first balloons to dirigibles then moves to the Wright brothers' flights and highlights early pioneers in flying - both men and women - and their accomplishments. Obviously, Lindberg is profiled but the series also brings to light a series of famous and lesser known early aviators. Segments on early passenger airlines and seaplanes are particularly good. The series moves on to post-WWII civil aviation with the advent of jet aircraft such as the De Havilland Comet and the Boeing 707. There's a segment that focuses on airlines and even shows Aeroflot - the Soviet Union's airline known for ""service with a scowl instead of service with a smile"".The segments are not in cronological order and there is some overlap resulting in the viewer watching the same thing several times. The narrator is from the UK and, although he pronounces words from the European continent correctly, he mispronounces American names of people, places and aircraft sometimes. The DVDs often use period promotional films in their entirety showing mundane matter such as the first ""computerized"" booking system (with punch cards), improvements in baggage handling systems or the British woman who was an airline employee and also a world record holder in bicycling. Really, a lot of the footage in the series seemed very much like ""filler"" and - quite literally - put me to sleep on several occasions. Really, I didn't want to see the evolution of steward and stewardess uniforms from the 1930's to the 1960's.To be sure, there's a lot of good viewing on the 3-disc, 8-segment series.
