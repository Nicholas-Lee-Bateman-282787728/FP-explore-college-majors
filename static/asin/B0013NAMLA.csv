1143898,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B0013NAMLA,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[7, 7]","The first two episodes of this tv series could be a feature film.  They are extremely well written and revolve around forensic expert Joe Donovan, his former colleagues in Manchester's pathology unit and his adulterous wife.  Although seemingly unrelated at first, these elements come together into some gruesome murders which threaten to tear his life apart.  These episodes are five stars.Unfortunately, the remaining three episodes seem as if they were written by someone else entirely using the same characters.  This time, however, the adulterous wife is not even interesting.  She behaves like a complete spoiled brat.  She wants more out of a life that has already given her everything and whines constantly about her unhappiness while she wallows in sumptuous luxury and idleness.  There are three episodes of her whining about she needs more out of life.  Frankly, it would have improved this series tremendously if she had become one of the corpses.In these three cases, Donovan is back in public service leading a home office forensic team.  So whereas the focus before was all on the very talented Tom Conti, the emphasis now shifts to getting to know the characters on his team as they attempt to solve some murders.  Once again a huge mistake.So the first two episodes are five stars and the next three episodes are at best three stars if one is being generous.This can also be viewed in its entirety on Netflix streaming as of this date.",4,"two out of five episodes are terrific, then goes downhill",1330300800,"02 27, 2012",2012,1452,"['first', 'two', 'episodes', 'tv', 'series', 'could', 'be', 'feature', 'film', 'are', 'extremely', 'well', 'written', 'revolve', 'forensic', 'expert', 'Joe', 'Donovan', 'former', 'colleagues', 'Manchester', 'pathology', 'unit', 'adulterous', 'wife', 'seemingly', 'unrelated', 'first', 'elements', 'come', 'together', 'gruesome', 'murders', 'threaten', 'tear', 'life', 'apart', 'episodes', 'are', 'five', 'stars.Unfortunately', 'remaining', 'three', 'episodes', 'seem', 'were', 'written', 'someone', 'else', 'entirely', 'using', 'same', 'characters', 'time', 'however', 'adulterous', 'wife', 'not', 'even', 'interesting', 'complete', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'more', 'life', 'already', 'given', 'everything', 'whines', 'constantly', 'unhappiness', 'sumptuous', 'luxury', 'idleness', 'are', 'three', 'episodes', 'whining', 'more', 'life', 'Frankly', 'would', 'have', 'improved', 'series', 'tremendously', 'had', 'become', 'one', 'corpses.In', 'three', 'cases', 'Donovan', 'back', 'public', 'service', 'leading', 'home', 'office', 'forensic', 'team', 'focus', 'was', 'very', 'talented', 'Tom', 'Conti', 'emphasis', 'now', 'getting', 'know', 'characters', 'team', 'attempt', 'solve', 'murders', 'Once', 'again', 'huge', 'mistake.So', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'are', 'five', 'stars', 'next', 'three', 'episodes', 'are', 'best', 'three', 'stars', 'one', 'being', 'generous.This', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'viewed', 'entirety', 'Netflix', 'streaming', 'date']",DNA

The series is heavy on the domestic life of a head of a crime lab who is  recovering from a nervous breakdown. The actress who plays his wife has the most diffilcultjob making her seem like a halfway likeable person as she cheats on her stressed out husband.  She is ultimately far more selfish and self centered than her husband.  The show is a good show but the first series was hysterionic with the murders all related to the main character and his selfish wife.  The other three episodes are much better with the crime lab taking on cases that are interesting.  Like way too many british shows they only made the six episodes total.  And it doesn't seem to matter if a show is successful; the brits often just can't make  many episodes or even continue a series for a long while. there are exceptions like 'silent witness"" ,  and 'the bill""  but way too often even a moderately successful show has only a few seasons.  This one only got to six episodes for whatever reason.  It's not as good as 'silent witness"" orthe great 'Waking the dead"" which has had many seasons but still not enough episodes each season; but it still has Tom Conti and his performance makes this show a much better experience than it would be without him.",4,conti makes this show,1234310400,"02 11, 2009",2009,1426,"['Tom', 'conti', 'fine', 'actor', 'class', 'whatever', 'show', 'in.In', 'case', 'DNA', 'reality', 'was', 'called', 'Donavon', 'when', 'was', 'shown', 'british', 'television', 'two', 'year', 'period', 'series', 'heavy', 'domestic', 'life', 'head', 'crime', 'lab', 'who', 'recovering', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'actress', 'who', 'wife', 'most', 'diffilcultjob', 'making', 'seem', 'halfway', 'likeable', 'person', 'stressed', 'out', 'husband', 'ultimately', 'far', 'more', 'selfish', 'self', 'centered', 'husband', 'show', 'good', 'show', 'first', 'series', 'was', 'hysterionic', 'murders', 'related', 'main', 'character', 'selfish', 'wife', 'other', 'three', 'episodes', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'crime', 'lab', 'taking', 'cases', 'are', 'interesting', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'british', 'shows', 'only', 'made', 'six', 'episodes', 'total', ""n't"", 'seem', 'matter', 'show', 'successful', 'brits', 'often', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'many', 'episodes', 'even', 'continue', 'series', 'long', 'while', 'are', 'exceptions', ""'silent"", 'witness', 'bill', 'way', 'too', 'often', 'even', 'moderately', 'successful', 'show', 'only', 'few', 'seasons', 'one', 'only', 'got', 'six', 'episodes', 'reason', 'not', 'as', 'good', ""'silent"", 'witness', 'orthe', 'great', ""'Waking"", 'dead', 'had', 'many', 'seasons', 'still', 'not', 'enough', 'season', 'still', 'Tom', 'Conti', 'performance', 'show', 'much', 'better', 'experience', 'would', 'be']",DNA
1143901,A1SV22OU1E7XRX,B0013NAMLA,ocarolan,"[3, 4]","Spoiler Alert!This series was initially released as ""Donovan,"" for the protagonist, Joseph Donovan, played by Tom Conti. Donovan is a retired expert in forensics and successful author whose personal life is complicated by his wife's serial infidelity. As the series opens, Donovan is asked to help the police with a murder investigation in which the name ""Donovan"" was scrawled in blood on the wall of the room in which the victim was found. It is not long before there is a second murder featuring Donovan's name writ large in blood at the scene. The direction the story is taking becomes clearer with the discovery of forensic evidence implicating Donovan, and he becomes suspect #1. Complicating matters for Donovan is his experiencing dissociative fugue - states during which he does things of which he has no memory - and Donovan's son having witnessed suspicious acts on the part of his father, acts his father denies. This opens the door to the possibility that Donovan committed the murders but has no memory of them. The police buy into this much quicker than will the astute viewer, who will realize that the series, then in its early episodes, has nowhere to go if Donovan is the murderer. Still, what unfolds might have been interesting had it been remotely plausible. Donovan's son, for example, who theretofore has not appeared overly enamored of his parents, falsely admits to having committed the murders so mum and dad can stay together. That is merely implausible. The following plot element from episode 2 is nothing short of bizarre.Donovan, realizing he is being framed and knowing by whom, conducts a clandestine, and illegal, search of the suspect's home at night. He leaves on foot, via a footpath along a river, unaware that the suspect, having returned, witnessed his exit and is following him, iron pry bar in hand. The suspect stealthily overtakes Donovan, strikes a crushing blow to the back of his head, and rolls his body into the river. We see Donovan's body floating face down, carried away by the current, over a spillway and into the distance. Now this, coming about halfway through the second of five episodes, left me wondering how the writers were going to resurrect their main character. Well, resurrect him they did, because soon we see Donovan, looking as healthy as ever (with not so much as a bandage on his head!), plotting to expose his attacker. How did he survive having his skull bashed with a pry bar and his body committed to the river? No explanation is offered. In fact, there is no subsequent reference to the incident at all! It is as though it never happened.For me, the series never recovered after that. Indeed, none of the following three episodes was potentially as interesting as the first two. The forensic aspects of the stories were not particularly interesting, and, as is often the case, the investigative team and the way in which it functioned were not realistic. Conti is good in the role of Donovan; indeed, he is the reason to watch the series. All in all, this is not a terrible series, but neither is it a particularly good one, either.",3,Neither terrible nor particularly good,1352592000,"11 11, 2012",2012,3108,"['Spoiler', 'Alert', 'series', 'was', 'initially', 'released', 'Donovan', 'protagonist', 'Joseph', 'Donovan', 'played', 'Tom', 'Conti', 'Donovan', 'retired', 'expert', 'forensics', 'successful', 'author', 'personal', 'life', 'complicated', 'wife', 'serial', 'infidelity', 'series', 'Donovan', 'asked', 'help', 'police', 'murder', 'investigation', 'name', 'Donovan', 'was', 'scrawled', 'blood', 'wall', 'room', 'victim', 'was', 'found', 'not', 'long', 'second', 'murder', 'featuring', 'Donovan', 'name', 'writ', 'large', 'blood', 'scene', 'direction', 'story', 'taking', 'becomes', 'clearer', 'discovery', 'forensic', 'evidence', 'implicating', 'Donovan', 'suspect', '1', 'Complicating', 'matters', 'Donovan', 'experiencing', 'dissociative', 'fugue', 'states', 'things', 'memory', 'Donovan', 'son', 'having', 'witnessed', 'suspicious', 'acts', 'part', 'father', 'father', 'denies', 'door', 'possibility', 'Donovan', 'committed', 'murders', 'memory', 'police', 'buy', 'much', 'quicker', 'will', 'astute', 'viewer', 'who', 'will', 'realize', 'series', 'then', 'early', 'episodes', 'nowhere', 'go', 'Donovan', 'murderer', 'Still', 'what', 'unfolds', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'had', 'been', 'remotely', 'plausible', 'Donovan', 'son', 'example', 'who', 'theretofore', 'not', 'appeared', 'overly', 'enamored', 'parents', 'falsely', 'having', 'committed', 'murders', 'so', 'mum', 'dad', 'can', 'stay', 'together', 'merely', 'implausible', 'following', 'plot', 'element', 'episode', '2', 'nothing', 'short', 'bizarre.Donovan', 'realizing', 'being', 'framed', 'knowing', 'whom', 'clandestine', 'illegal', 'search', 'suspect', 'home', 'night', 'foot', 'footpath', 'river', 'unaware', 'suspect', 'having', 'returned', 'witnessed', 'exit', 'following', 'iron', 'pry', 'bar', 'hand', 'suspect', 'stealthily', 'overtakes', 'Donovan', 'crushing', 'blow', 'back', 'head', 'body', 'river', 'see', 'Donovan', 'body', 'floating', 'face', 'down', 'carried', 'away', 'current', 'spillway', 'distance', 'Now', 'coming', 'halfway', 'second', 'five', 'episodes', 'left', 'wondering', 'how', 'writers', 'were', 'going', 'resurrect', 'main', 'character', 'Well', 'resurrect', 'did', 'soon', 'see', 'Donovan', 'looking', 'as', 'healthy', 'ever', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'bandage', 'head', 'plotting', 'expose', 'attacker', 'How', 'did', 'survive', 'having', 'skull', 'bashed', 'pry', 'bar', 'body', 'committed', 'river', 'explanation', 'offered', 'fact', 'subsequent', 'reference', 'incident', 'never', 'happened.For', 'series', 'never', 'recovered', 'Indeed', 'none', 'following', 'three', 'episodes', 'was', 'potentially', 'as', 'interesting', 'first', 'two', 'forensic', 'aspects', 'stories', 'were', 'not', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'often', 'case', 'investigative', 'team', 'way', 'functioned', 'were', 'not', 'realistic', 'Conti', 'good', 'role', 'Donovan', 'indeed', 'reason', 'watch', 'series', 'not', 'terrible', 'series', 'particularly', 'good', 'one']",DNA

Tom Conti plays a police DNA technician who was traumatized by a case, left the force and became a crime fiction writer.  Now his life has become complicated.  His wife (Samantha Bond) has been unfaithful to him and her lovers are turning up dead, positioned like the victim in one of the protagonist's previous cases.  Moreover, the protagonist is suffering blackouts.  Has he been killing people during these periods?  Or is his son killing them in order to repair his parents' marriage?  Who can we trust?The respective cases are driven by what appears to be decisive DNA evidence, but has that evidence been planted?  The resulting story is an engaging drama, one that can easily be imagined on a West End stage.  The writing is excellent, the production values high, the acting expert.Some reviewers have found it slow; I did not.  This is high-tension psychological drama in which the characters are trying to psych out motives, intentions, eye movements and slips of the tongue.  While there is some violence and sexual tension this is not a car-chase shoot `em up or a microscope-laden CSI drama.
