I could feel the muscles in my legs and abs work very hard while going through the poses. Especially the chair pose. The only thing I didn't like was they do the triangle pose to one side, but not the other. I'm the type of person who needs to do the poses to both sides of the body. It really wasn't a big deal I just went ahead and did it to the other side.

550574,A17TDSX354MP7Y,B00004TJL3,CPTScott,"[17, 17]","I've done this tape several times and really like it a lot!The particular things I like about this practice are:1. Al Bingham is an excellent easy to follow instructor.2. Modifications are shown by one instructor and the full poses by the other.3. Much of it is based on the Sun Salutations, but it is broken down incrementally so that your body has a chance to adapt to each posture.4. I found that it generated a good amount of heat and sweat.5. It's only about 30 minutes which makes it very doable in terms of fitting into a schedule, plus you can push pretty hard without it becoming impossibly long so you don't have to worry about becoming overly fatigued.6. It's challenging physically but all the poses can be done by most people in reasonably good health (no crazy poses that you need to be Gumby in order to perform).7. The Yoga Zone programs in general have a very nice feel to them, a nice presentation in terms of the scenery and the instructors are not intimidating.8. The pacing is flowing but not rushed.Just a suggestion for those doing this regarding the chair poses. If you find them really tough (and they certainly can be), just start straight legged, the as you slowly sweep your arms overhead (or in front of you) gently lower down to the first ""edge"" of tension and breathe there. Don't push yourself EVER to the point of pain, just  mild discomfort. You can also practice them dynamically, start higher up (straighter legs) and on each inhale raise up a little to release the stress and on each exhale just gently go a little bit lower than before. This makes the pose much safer and builds heat.Anyway, I like this video, the bonus video is also an effective practice and only about 20 ,minutes so it's a nice practice to either alternate with for variety or to use on days when time is short.Namaste",5,Excellent Flowing and Heating Practice,1086220800,"06 3, 2004",2004,1827,"[""'ve"", 'done', 'tape', 'several', 'times', 'really', 'lot', 'particular', 'things', 'like', 'practice', 'are:1', 'Al', 'Bingham', 'excellent', 'easy', 'follow', 'instructor.2', 'Modifications', 'are', 'shown', 'one', 'instructor', 'full', 'poses', 'other.3', 'Much', 'based', 'Sun', 'Salutations', 'broken', 'down', 'incrementally', 'so', 'body', 'chance', 'adapt', 'posture.4', 'found', 'generated', 'good', 'amount', 'heat', 'sweat.5', 'only', 'about', '30', 'minutes', 'very', 'doable', 'terms', 'fitting', 'schedule', 'can', 'push', 'pretty', 'hard', 'becoming', 'impossibly', 'long', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'becoming', 'overly', 'fatigued.6', 'challenging', 'physically', 'poses', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'most', 'people', 'reasonably', 'good', 'health', 'crazy', 'need', 'be', 'Gumby', 'order', 'perform', '.7', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'programs', 'general', 'have', 'very', 'nice', 'feel', 'nice', 'presentation', 'terms', 'scenery', 'instructors', 'are', 'not', 'intimidating.8', 'pacing', 'flowing', 'not', 'rushed.Just', 'suggestion', 'doing', 'regarding', 'chair', 'poses', 'find', 'really', 'tough', 'certainly', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'start', 'straight', 'legged', 'slowly', 'sweep', 'arms', 'overhead', 'front', 'gently', 'lower', 'down', 'first', 'edge', 'tension', 'breathe', 'there', 'Do', ""n't"", 'push', 'EVER', 'point', 'pain', 'just', 'mild', 'discomfort', 'can', 'also', 'practice', 'dynamically', 'start', 'higher', 'up', 'straighter', 'legs', 'inhale', 'raise', 'up', 'little', 'release', 'stress', 'exhale', 'just', 'gently', 'go', 'little', 'bit', 'lower', 'before', 'pose', 'much', 'safer', 'heat.Anyway', 'like', 'video', 'bonus', 'video', 'also', 'effective', 'practice', 'only', 'about', '20', 'minutes', 'nice', 'practice', 'alternate', 'variety', 'use', 'days', 'when', 'time', 'short.Namaste']",Yoga Zone: Yoga for Weight Loss VHS

Duncan,"[29, 30]","this is some where in between a regular beginning/intermediate yoga session and a power yoga workout.  it's a relatively short (30 minute) session that is usually good for working up a little sweat.  it has the activity level of power yoga but with the less challenging poses more commonly associated with the beginning/intermediate level.  also, it doesn't have very many stretching poses so don't look to this tape as something to really enhance your flexibility all that much.i already had yoga zone's flexibility and tone video and their power yoga video.  i feel that by adding this one i have a fairly complete set that keeps me interested and gives me a diverse workout when used in rotation with the other two.",4,nice addition to the yoga video collection,982800000,"02 22, 2001",2001,718,"['where', 'regular', 'beginning/intermediate', 'yoga', 'session', 'power', 'yoga', 'workout', 'relatively', 'short', '30', 'minute', 'session', 'usually', 'good', 'working', 'up', 'little', 'sweat', 'activity', 'level', 'power', 'yoga', 'less', 'challenging', 'poses', 'more', 'commonly', 'associated', 'beginning/intermediate', 'level', 'also', ""n't"", 'have', 'very', 'many', 'stretching', 'poses', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'tape', 'something', 'really', 'enhance', 'flexibility', 'much.i', 'already', 'had', 'zone', 'flexibility', 'tone', 'video', 'power', 'yoga', 'video', 'i', 'feel', 'adding', 'one', 'i', 'have', 'fairly', 'complete', 'set', 'interested', 'diverse', 'workout', 'when', 'used', 'rotation', 'other', 'two']",Yoga Zone: Yoga for Weight Loss VHS

550578,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00004TJL3,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[15, 15]","Al Bingham has a unique teaching style. He focuses on achieving and maintaining the correct position for each posture. This particular Weight Loss Yoga practice session relies on time-tested principles to achieve weight loss results.By removing all the restlessness you experience from daily stress, you can then start to address unconscious eating habits. Suddenly, you are making better choices and wandering in the natural foods isle of your grocery store. Since starting Yoga, I've rarely found myself at a fast-food establishment and when I do happen to be there with my husband, I'm making better choices. For example - salads or low carb options.So, Yoga works. This I've proven to myself. It strengthens you from the inside out and also helps you focus on your health instead of just ""exercising."" Yoga actually makes you a more well-rounded person, except you can see it toning your muscles and making your face look more relaxed. In fact, if you skip your Yoga, you start to crave the peaceful serenity of your daily ""moment with yourself.""Al Bingham's voice is so pleasant and his instruction style is positive and nurturing. I love how he takes a hands-on approach and really guides you through each exercise. You can be assured you are doing it correctly because he explains each position in depth.This is one of the most accessible yoga workouts out there. The exercises range from beginner to intermediate with some interesting variations for the chair pose which made the pose less exhausting, and much more creative. You will recognize positions like Warrior 1 and plank pose. There are yoga-style pushups and the entire exercise routine is pleasantly paced. The Sun Salutations are healing and teach you to breathe.Al Bingham's calming voice makes this a favorite for late night relaxing. The beach scenes take you out of your home environment and give you a mini vacation.~The Rebecca ReviewP.S.
