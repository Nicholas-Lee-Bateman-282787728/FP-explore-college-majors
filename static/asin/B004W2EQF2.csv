It is easy to get fed up with all the characters' hysterics and big watery eyes. However, it doesn't completely ring untrue as we see the destructive nature of doing the stupid things people do every day (marrying someone you barely know, developing unhealthy obsessions with the way you think things are SUPPOSED to be in your life rather than what they are, the havoc of having a low self worth,and the missed opportunities to build healthy relationships due to a failure to honestly communicate and self-disclose).  Creating the emotional space to self-reflect and gain ""closure"" is a concept that escapes these characters, and perhaps that's why their angst and bad choices ring more than a little true to life.",3,The down side,1330819200,"03 4, 2012",2012,848,"[""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'series', 'writing', 'been', 'suspenseful', 'denying', 'season', 'definitely', 'downer', 'easy', 'get', 'fed', 'up', 'characters', 'hysterics', 'big', 'watery', 'eyes', 'However', ""n't"", 'completely', 'ring', 'untrue', 'see', 'destructive', 'nature', 'doing', 'stupid', 'things', 'people', 'do', 'day', 'marrying', 'someone', 'barely', 'know', 'developing', 'unhealthy', 'obsessions', 'way', 'think', 'things', 'are', 'SUPPOSED', 'be', 'life', 'rather', 'what', 'are', 'havoc', 'having', 'low', 'self', 'worth', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'build', 'healthy', 'relationships', 'due', 'failure', 'honestly', 'communicate', 'self-disclose', 'Creating', 'emotional', 'space', 'self-reflect', 'gain', 'closure', 'concept', 'characters', 'perhaps', 'why', 'angst', 'bad', 'choices', 'ring', 'more', 'little', 'true', 'life']",MISTRESSES - SERIES 3 [NON-USA Format / Import / Region 2 / PAL]

The characters became more completed, the feelings are deeper and the story line gets better and better. The performers are more comfortable in their shoes too. This session they worked so well together, the end of it brought tears in my eyes.I hope Amazon will have session 4 available soon!",5,Session 3 is the best,1374624000,"07 24, 2013",2013,401,"['like', 'series', 'very', 'much', 'loved', 'see', 'been', 'improved', 'session', 'session', '3', 'best', 'characters', 'became', 'more', 'completed', 'feelings', 'are', 'deeper', 'story', 'line', 'better', 'better', 'performers', 'are', 'more', 'comfortable', 'shoes', 'too', 'session', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'together', 'end', 'brought', 'tears', 'eyes.I', 'hope', 'Amazon', 'will', 'have', 'session', '4', 'available', 'soon']",MISTRESSES - SERIES 3 [NON-USA Format / Import / Region 2 / PAL]
