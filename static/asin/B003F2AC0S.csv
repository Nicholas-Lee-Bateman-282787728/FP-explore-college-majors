You must keep in mind, watching the movie, that Confucius lived in 450 BC..BC,  The civility of the people, though it is a feudal and war-torn time, is amazing.  I knew of the formality and codes of that period, but you truly grasp the effect of them in the movie.  They were much more advanced than peoples in the rest of the world and considered manners and philosophy a way of life- again-B.C. and were comparative to Greece.  Cast acting and direction very good.  But the focal point is the man, his journey and the progressive impact he had on his society.  Villified and betrayed, he was true to his teaching of honor, compassion, loyalty and human striving for the good of all.  He was a remarkable man.  The movie is profound, beautiful and sad.

1342723,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B003F2AC0S,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[3, 3]","""What you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others."" - The Golden Rule by ConfuciusHe is known as the greatest sage of all ages, the idealist and educator who was known for being one of the greatest Chinese thinkers and philosophers.It is also through the teaching of Confucius' principles that is strongly intertwined into Chinese tradition and belief such as one's loyalty to family, worship of ancestry, the young must respect their elders and the family as a basis for an ideal government.To commemorate the 60th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the 2,560th birthday of Confucius, a film was made to honor Confucius, also in the hopes to remind Chinese of his teaching, introduce the younger generation to Confucius as well as those around the world.VIDEO:""Confucius"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1 aspect ratio).  For teh most part, the picture quality is very good.  Cinematography of beautiful landscapes and costume design are expected, but there are some moments where the CG and the use of the green screen didn't seem to look natural.  Colors are saturated and there are moments where I saw some banding issues, but for the most part, the film looked good on Blu-ray.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Confucius"" is presented in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 via Mandarin and an English dub track.  The film does utilize ambience especially the sounds of arrows during the action sequences, the sound of wind during the snow storm or the crackling of ice or even the breaking down of the city walls which sounded very good.  But for the most part, the overall mix was adequate for this film.  It's not an immersive soundtrack but dialogue is crisp and clear, the musical soundtrack by Jiping Zhao was fantastic, but the film is primarily front and center channel driven.As for the English dub, I prefer to watch Asian films in their original language but for those who are not into reading the English subtitles and prefer to listen to the English dub, the good news is FUNimation Entertainment are known for casting wonderful voice talent and the voice acting may please those who prefer in hearing the English dub.SPECIAL FEATURES""Confucius"" comes with the following special features:From Chow Yun-Fat to Confucius - (7:10) - Behind-the-scenes with Chow Yun-Fat and director Hu-Mei.A Woman, A Bosom Friend - (7:04) A featurette on Zhou Xun and her preparation for her role.Chaotic Period of Spring and Autumn - (6:59) Director Hu Mei talks about the creation of ""Confucius"" and the challenges she faced.From Chow Yun-Fat to Confucius Special Edition - (6:59) The cast and crew talk about the hiring of Chow Yun-Fat to play Confucius and their thoughts about working with him, plus interviews with Chow.The Politicians - (7:12) A looking into the politics of the film.Animal Stars - (7:43) Behind-the-scenes footage of the animals in the film.Progressing in the Snow - (6:26) Cinematographer Peter Pau talks about the snow scene.The Warfare - (7:06) How the green screen segments of the battles were filmed.Original Trailer - (1:43) The original theatrical trailerTrailers - Funimation Entertainment trailersEXTRAS:""Confucius"" comes with the Blu-ray and DVD edition of the film plus a slipcover case.JUDGMENT CALL:""Confucius"" was an intriguing film for me, but because I am not a Confucius erudite, I must admit, I felt a bit unsettled because I wondered how can someone with a life that has created an impact on Chinese culture, be condensed in a two hour film.Also, because the film was made to help introduce Confucius to a new audience, a younger audience, the film could not be cerebral or too philosophical and thus the film introduced many war elements into the film.For me, ""Confucius"" intrigued me so much that I spent hours researching his contributions to Chinese society, going through philosophy blogs that debate his book or those who support his work but also to go through criticism and praise for the film.  To find out what people liked and what made people ticked about the film.Suffice to say, ""Confucius"" has received a lot of criticism even before the film was made into a reality.  For one, the hiring of Chow Yun-Fat (a Hong Kong Cantonese-speaking actor) instead of a mainland Chinese actor who speaks Mandarin and also the fact that Chow Yun-Fat's film career has been based on action.Then there were rumors that drew the ire of many people.  Mainly because of the film featuring Zhou Xun's character of Nanzi and that Confucius will be having a romance with the actress in the film.  It's important to note that this never happens in the film but the rumors persisted especially due to misconceptions of the theatrical trailer that a descendent of Confucius filed a lawsuit in order to have certain scenes, especially anything intimate between Confucius and Nanzi to be removed.And last, there were Chinese who were upset that Chinese authorities removed James Cameron's  ""Avatar"" from film theaters and replaced it with ""Confucius"" in order to prevent the sci-fi film from taking any money away from ""Confucius"".But regardless of the criticism of the film, ""Confucius"" was going to be a film that was not going to please everyone.  As scholars and those who respect Confucius' teachings may find the film blasphemous because it does not focus on the actual idealist and educator but more of the politician and military strategist.It is quite obvious that the writers had to make concessions in order to win over a younger audience but quite possibly an international audience.  From the hundreds of arrows being shot in the air and a brave Confucius beating on the drums as arrows come crashing all around him.  It does make for great action, but I am aware that the use of action in a film about Confucius may be disconcerting for those who want more of the intellectual side of the well-known sage.And for a man with a long career, to fit so much into a 2-hour film, there is only so much that can be done.  I felt the writers tried to appease both sides by bringing in a plot around militaristic action and balance it with the use of philosophy and ideals without being too cerebral and I accept that.As for Chow Yun-Fat, I felt he did a good job at playing Confucius.  And no, for those wondering if Confucius engages in any martial arts or if he fights, the answer is no.  This is a thinking man, a man who appreciates music, ethics, politics and social relationships with sincerity.As for historical accuracy, while his teaching can be found in the ""Analects of Confucius"", there were some instances that relate to his disciples that I was checking online for hours to see if these characters actually existed and if some of their demise was factual.  I couldn't really find anything to support if the demise of disciples as shown in the movie was fiction or non-fiction but through my research, the actual events that relate to the states and the war, especially the ""meeting"" with the State of Qi and the tearing of the walls, information relating to those scenes were easily found online.As for the Blu-ray release of ""Confucius"", the picture quality was very good but it did have some issues.  Lossless audio was appropriate for this type of film, although it would have been even better to have a bit more of an immersive soundscape during the more action-intensive scenes.  I am glad there were several special features that show the making of the film but also how passionate the writers, the crew and talent were in making this film a reality but also trying to be respectful to Confucius.Granted, there is more to Confucius than what the writers could touch upon in 2 hours and anything delving too much into the idealist and philosophy may appeal to his followers and the intellectuals but that would have made the film too cerebral and would eventually turn off the younger viewers, especially many of its international viewers who are not too familiar with the respected philosopher.  And because of its trailer, many people would expect war and a lot of battles.Overall, ""Confucius"" was an intriguing film that was neither great, nor was it terrible.  If anything, I was satisfied by the film to the point that it made me want to research all I can about Confucius for hours.Prior to watching this film, I hardly knew anything about Confucius but now I find myself interested in reading the ""Analects of Confucius"" and discovering and learning more about his work.For anyone who is curious about Confucius especially those who may be fans of Chow Yun-Fat or actress Zhou Xun, you may find ""Confucius"" to be intriguing, entertaining and a film worth their while.",4,"(3.5 stars) Overall, a fascinating film that is lacking in many areas of its

1342724,AYG1U47VFZ165,B003F2AC0S,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[66, 78]","Usually, I love films that depict the peoples, places, and events from history.  Granted, I prefer that films ""do it right,"" don't exaggerate the importance of people and events because, when they do, I think those pictures rob the audience of experiencing, first-hand, those moments of discovery ... let's call them even `moments of appreciation' ... for what a person, place, or event meant to all of history.  When you rob the viewer from reaching that conclusion on his own, one could make the case that the flick is little more than historical propaganda.  What emerges is a stream of half-truths - all bloated to underscore the producer's particular obsession with what he believes is inspiring - and nothing about the central figure is genuinely ""learned"" in the process.  All that is ""learned"" is what the producer or the writer or the maker wanted.  What's lost - the true impact on history - is often far greater than what's gained.All of this brings me to CONFUCIUS.  History tells me that Confucius is one of China's most revered and beloved scholars.  He's known for being a skilled orator, quick with a reflective phrase, mentally adept with a command of didactic language.  He was a sought after by leaders to provide counsel on a whole host of matters, from military engagements to advice in private affairs of state.  What emerges from this motion picture, however, is befuddling, at best.According to the box art: ""In this sweeping battlefield epic, Confucius finds his lands threatened by the fires of war.  After leading the nation's most powerful army to victory against hordes of invaders, the new hero finds even greater danger in the jealous eyes of the aristocrats he fought to protect.""  Now, those two sentences make perfect sense when read; but, sadly, what emerges on film is a man who tricks their enemy into surrender, and then he's snubbed by those - the aristocrats - he helped pull the wool over the eyes of their mutual enemies.  The rest of film presents Confucius's life as a wanderer from land to land, and, somehow through it all, he manages to maintain a loyal following, though I couldn't - for the life of me - tell you why.In fact, Confucius utters few epic phrases in this epic picture ... about epicness.  At best, he pulls off a few solid suggestions, maybe a witty implication or two, but nothing I'd print on a fortune cookie.  I say this not meaning for any of it to sound disrespectful or insulting, certainly not to any of the Chinese people, but I have to believe Confucius did far more good than what gets screen time in this two-plus-hour ""epic.""  As usual, I've done some reading, and while I've read a far amount of praise for Chow Yun-Fat in the titular role, I have to admit some shock in saying I just don't see it.  Chow Yun-Fat has always seemed far more at home with a blazing .45 in his hands.  Here?  I think his talents are wasted, though he did receive a nominee for `Best Actor' in the Hong Kong Film Awards.It all looks very impressive, though.  Peter Pau - the cinematographer for CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON - makes it all look wonderful, and the special effects for what few battlefield sequences are shown here (there's essentially very, very little warfare because Confucius's strengths were avoiding it) are, indeed, wonderful.  It's just all told with an overemphasis on maintaining a timeline; the people are completely and utterly lost - and devoid of any luster - within the frame.In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the only person plucked from history and put up on the screen who appears even remotely legitimate (or real) is actress Xun Zhou.  She plays a royal consort, Nan Zi, who apparently secretly loves (or admires?) the teachings of Confucius, though the film provides no essential backstory as to why.  Also, her role here is very brief - it's hard to even justify it as a cameo, she's given so little to do - but the actress actually breathes life into her scant scenes in a way any talent should in a biopic.  Everything else here is drily academic ... and not in the good drily academic way.CONFUCIUS's greatest failure is that it's progressively frustrating.  I'll try to explain that, though I'll admit this may be a bit difficult as the experience was more than a bit confusing.The picture begins with a series of character introductions - seemingly every person and period involved requires a specific subtitle introducing or highlighting the importance to back to Confucius's timeline - and the narrative device simply never lets up, implying that the viewer might be loss without this service provided by the filmmakers.  Then, the film unfolds as if requiring this ongoing familiarity with all of Confucius's entire life.  It's almost as if the script were written only with ""fans of Confucius"" in mind, entreating the viewer to marvel, ""Oh, yeah, this is the moment when Confucius first said ____"" and ""that's the first time Confucius said ____.""  (Confucius fans can fill in the blank.)  Biopics aren't always this force-fed to an audience.  At least, many of them I've seen haven't used this narrative device.  I can't help but wonder if the screenplay required a few more drafts OR were the producers pressed for time and simply decided to go with what required the least participation on the part of only an informed audience.  Having known absolutely nothing about the life of Confucius, I can say that, after viewing the film, I'm not inclined in the slightest to want to run out and read more.In fact, how can a film detailing the life of one of China's greatest thinkers, speakers, educators, be so flat, dimensionless, and uninteresting?RECOMMENDED with strong reservation: certainly not for everyone, but it's worth a single view, if even for its prettiness.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Funimation provided me with a DVD screener for the expressed purposes of writing this review.",2,"Confucius Says ""Making My Biopic Will Be Troubling""",1332288000,"03 21, 2012",2012,5944,"['Usually', 'love', 'films', 'depict', 'peoples', 'places', 'events', 'history',

1342732,A2SIBFTMWJY6ZS,B003F2AC0S,John C. Marshell Jr.,"[10, 11]","I am not sure I would rank this film with Spartacus or The Ten Commandments, but it is a very good movie, well filmed, with many aesthetically pleasing scenes.  I cannot really speak about the historical accuracy of the film.  The last book I read on Confucius was in college many years ago written by Herrlee Creel (Confucius and the Chinese Way). Though my Chinese history professor thought it was the best book Creel ever wrote, I am sure it is dated by now.  The more current biography by Ann-ping Chin,The Authentic Confucius: A Life of Thought and Politics, has received good reviews and may provide more insights into Confucius' life.Unfortunately, I do not understand Chinese, so like the other reviewers, I am reduced to reading subtitles.  There are ""double subtitles,"" too.  Some subtitles are incorporated into the film that provide historical background, another set of subtitles provide  dialogue translations at the very bottom of the screen, and, yes, they move a bit quickly and can appear simultaneously, so you might miss things the first time through.  Fortunately, the film is worthy of multiple viewings, so don't worry about this too much.  The two scenes that impressed me the  most were a dialogue between Lao Tzu and Confucius, probably inspired by the Chuang Tzu, shot as a dream sequence, as the two of them probably never met and the actual existence of Lao Tzu still a subject of debate, and the death of Yan Hui, one of Confucius' favorite disciples, who loses his life trying to save books from a lake.  Both scenes have beautiful color and use light with great effect, especially Yan Hui's death scene in which the action is slowed down.  You don't have to be a book lover to appreciate his courage and nobility in trying to rescue the things of greatest importance to Confucius and his disciples.Chow-yun Fat's performance is very human. Confucius is portrayed not as an icon, but as a multi-dimensional and somewhat complicated character who maintains his principles despite adversity.  However,I would have liked to have seen more in the way of relationship building between Confucius  and his students.  The film portrays Confucius' interaction with his students in wide bipolar swings, either aloof and restrained or deeply emotional and attached, depending on the narrative's needs.  Developing the student-teacher relationships would have provided a venue for revealing more of Confucius' philosophy, which, I am sad to say, is a little weak in its presentation.  While there is much mention of ""humanity"" and ""propriety,"" important Confucian themes, discussion of the ""Five Great Relationships,"" the character of human nature, or ""filial"" obligations seems slight and indirect.  Though these themes are well incorporated into the plot, they somewhat suffer from it, as the plot can become complicated and hard to follow demanding careful attention from the viewer.  Confucian philosophy can become secondary and obscured by the narrative.  Notably, in first half of the film, when a political triangulation and court intrigue undermine Confucius' authority and sends him into exile. Confucian ritual is portrayed, but I think its significance is lost to the Western viewer.  Consequently, Confucius, though very human, lacks intellectual depth, and a shallow sage he was not.",4,Confucian Cinema,1293321600,"12 26, 2010",2010,3316,"['am', 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'rank', 'film', 'Spartacus', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'well', 'filmed', 'many', 'aesthetically', 'pleasing', 'scenes', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'speak', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'film', 'last', 'book', 'read', 'Confucius', 'was', 'college', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'written', 'Herrlee', 'Creel', 'Confucius', 'Chinese', 'Way', 'Chinese', 'history', 'professor', 'thought', 'was', 'best', 'book', 'Creel', 'ever', 'wrote', 'am', 'sure', 'dated', 'now', 'more', 'current', 'biography', 'Ann-ping', 'Chin', 'Authentic', 'Confucius', 'Life', 'Thought', 'Politics', 'received', 'good', 'reviews', 'may', 'provide', 'more', 'insights', 'Confucius', 'life.Unfortunately', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'Chinese', 'other', 'reviewers', 'am', 'reduced', 'reading', 'subtitles', 'are', 'double', 'subtitles', 'too', 'subtitles', 'are', 'incorporated', 'film', 'provide', 'historical', 'background', 'set', 'subtitles', 'provide', 'dialogue', 'translations', 'very', 'bottom', 'screen', 'yes', 'move', 'bit', 'quickly', 'can', 'appear', 'simultaneously', 'might', 'miss', 'things', 'first', 'time', 'Fortunately', 'film', 'worthy', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'too', 'much', 'two', 'scenes', 'impressed', 'most', 'were', 'dialogue', 'Lao', 'Tzu', 'Confucius', 'probably', 'inspired', 'Chuang', 'Tzu', 'shot', 'dream', 'sequence', 'two', 'probably', 'never', 'met', 'actual', 'existence', 'Lao', 'Tzu', 'still', 'subject', 'debate', 'death', 'Yan', 'Hui', 'one', 'Confucius', 'favorite', 'disciples', 'who', 'life', 'trying', 'save', 'books', 'lake', 'scenes', 'have', 'beautiful', 'color', 'use', 'light', 'great', 'effect', 'especially', 'Yan', 'Hui', 'death', 'scene', 'action', 'slowed', 'down', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'book', 'lover', 'appreciate', 'courage', 'nobility', 'trying', 'rescue', 'things', 'greatest', 'importance', 'Confucius', 'disciples.Chow-yun', 'Fat', 'performance', 'very', 'human', 'Confucius', 'portrayed', 'not', 'icon', 'multi-dimensional', 'somewhat', 'complicated', 'character', 'who', 'principles', 'adversity', 'However', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'way', 'relationship', 'building', 'Confucius', 'students', 'film', 'Confucius', 'interaction', 'students', 'wide', 'bipolar', 'swings', 'aloof', 'restrained', 'deeply', 'emotional', 'attached', 'depending', 'narrative', 'needs', 'Developing', 'student-teacher', 'relationships', 'would', 'have', 'provided', 'venue', 'revealing', 'more', 'Confucius', 'philosophy', 'am', 'sad', 'say', 'little', 'weak', 'presentation', 'much', 'mention', 'humanity', 'propriety', 'important', 'Confucian', 'themes', 'discussion', 'Five', 'Great', 'Relationships', 'character', 'human', 'nature', 'filial', 'obligations', 'slight', 'indirect', 'themes', 'are', 'well', 'incorporated', 'plot', 'somewhat', 'suffer', 'plot', 'can', 'become', 'complicated', 'hard', 'follow', 'demanding', 'careful', 'attention', 'viewer', 'Confucian', 'philosophy', 'can', 'become', 'secondary', 'obscured', 'narrative', 'Notably', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'when', 'political', 'triangulation', 'court', 'intrigue', 'undermine', 'Confucius', 'authority', 'exile', 'Confucian', 'ritual', 'portrayed', 'think', 'significance', 'lost', 'Western', 'viewer', 'Consequently', 'Confucius', 'though', 'very', 'human', 'intellectual', 'depth', 'shallow', 'sage', 'was', 'not']",N/A

The challenge is to read the subtitle while keeping an eye on the stunning visuals.This movie is an epic equal to Cleopatra, Moses or Sparticus.  However, if you expect a potboiler, you won't get one--not all the time.  This movie was filmed for a Chinese/Asian audience and their tastes are not as shallow as what most Americans prefer so there are slow but meaningful scenes that I'm sure are there for people to actually think. I'm sure the Chinese didn't want to ruin the movie by letting Hollywood get hold of it.The DVD I bought and watched had a photo of Confucius with a beautiful woman on the cover. They must have added her to the cover for the Western audience since she is a beauty. However, in the movie, she plays a minor role and is assassinated for being too smart and wanting too much power in a violent world dominated by men, who are busy killing each other. She doesn't have much screen time. In fact, there are not that many women in the movie.From what I know of Confucius, the movie showed him close to who he must have been--an honorable man who wanted to bring peace to a war-torn land and end the people's suffering.  Like Moses, he spent more than a decade wondering the country in search of someone who would listen besides the rag-tag band of students who stuck to him like glue. If anything, we could learn something about dedication and loyalty from this band and their master.I recommend this movie to anyone interested in China.",4,Learning from a Master,1280534400,"07 31, 2010",2010,1862,"['visuals', 'movie', 'are', 'stunning', 'Chow', 'Yun', 'Fat', 'incredibly', 'convincing', 'job', 'playing', 'Confucius', 'who', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'abused', 'rulers', 'still', 'honored', 'one', 'flaws', 'philosophy.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'Mandarin', 'must', 'rely', 'English', 'subtitles', 'be', 'warned', 'most', 'time', 'subtitles', 'are', 'mangled', 'do', 'not', 'stay', 'screen', 'long', 'enough', 'read', 'challenge', 'read', 'subtitle', 'keeping', 'eye', 'stunning', 'visuals.This', 'movie', 'epic', 'equal', 'Cleopatra', 'Moses', 'Sparticus', 'However', 'expect', 'potboiler', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'one', 'not', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'Chinese/Asian', 'audience', 'tastes', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'shallow', 'what', 'most', 'Americans', 'prefer', 'so', 'are', 'slow', 'meaningful', 'scenes', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'there', 'people', 'actually', 'think', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Chinese', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'movie', 'letting', 'Hollywood', 'get', 'hold', 'it.The', 'DVD', 'bought', 'watched', 'had', 'photo', 'Confucius', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'cover', 'must', 'have', 'added', 'cover', 'Western', 'audience', 'beauty', 'However', 'movie', 'minor', 'role', 'assassinated', 'being', 'too', 'smart', 'wanting', 'too', 'much', 'power', 'violent', 'world', 'dominated', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'busy', 'killing', 'other', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'fact', 'are', 'not', 'many', 'women', 'movie.From', 'what', 'know', 'Confucius', 'movie', 'showed', 'close', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'honorable', 'man', 'who', 'wanted', 'bring', 'peace', 'war-torn', 'land', 'end', 'people', 'suffering', 'Moses', 'spent', 'more', 'decade', 'wondering', 'country', 'search', 'someone', 'who', 'would', 'listen', 'rag-tag', 'band', 'students', 'who', 'stuck', 'glue', 'anything', 'could', 'learn', 'something', 'dedication', 'loyalty', 'band', 'master.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'interested', 'China']",N/A

1342745,A238W7T3KJAKQH,B003F2AC0S,shaun brammer,"[0, 0]","While I have always been critical of historical films I have still enjoyed them and supported many, as they are sometimes the door for a person to become familiar with an aspect of history. This might, I dare suggest, lead to reading a book. Taking on the figure of Kongzi in a biographical movie is a risk to either provide something real and accessible to viewers, or to produce a misleading bit of fantastical myth. Indeed, there was and still is much debate over this interpretation of the Master Sage. I was please to find this production firmly planted on solid reason, with only a little embellishments.The film focuses on what are the major events of Kongzi's life minus much of the myth surrounding him. It ignores his birth, which in some texts is straight out of Greek myth, and skips right to the well know period when he was an advisor for Duke Ding of Lu. It stays with this period of his life throughout beginning of the film, showing his successes as an advisor and how it made him enemies with the powerful family clans that mostly ran the state. The film continues after Kongzi is exiled from Lu and travels the Middle Kingdom looking for employment with his band of followers. It shows some famous meetings Kongzi had with those in power and how destitute he and his followers become traveling the countryside, as well as some of the appointments to government posts his followers win for themselves. Eventually, the film brings the story full circle only after Kongzi learns to be content with teaching and writing the now famous Annuls.How this film appears is quite stunning. The costumes are very well done and showing a high degree of accuracy, as well as the sets. The viewer is given a good sense of how advanced ancient China really was by the technology and the decorations shown. The importance of this is to show that Kongzi was not speaking to a world filled with people incapable of understanding him, but an educated and develop people that could weight his words and their value.There are many great actors in this film, especially among those that played Kongzi's followers. Ren Quan as Yan Hui is worthy of note, playing out the young man's steadfast loyalty to the Master he follows. He seems to suffer more at his Master's setbacks than Kongzi myself. Many of the actors play out emotional scenes of loss and suffering very well, tears welling up and wails of despair in the best classical Chinese cinematic tradition. However great the others are the film had to rest on one actor, and that was whoever played Kongzi. The tall frame of Chow Yun-fat held up well carrying the weight of Chinese history. He portrayed a well balanced blend of humility and knowledge throughout the movie. That might be the only real compliant, as the arrogance that a younger Kongzi was said to possess is not shown here.There were many doubters when his Chow was announced to play Kongzi. People felt that the native Cantonese speaker would distort the Mandarin in which he would have to speak, thus making Kongzi sound less intelligent. Not being fleunt in either of these languages I can not comment on that myself. Chow has always had presence, it is one of the things I enjoy most about his movies. I have never felt that he was an actor to play any role, but an actor to play the right roles, ones that commanded such a presence. How Chow physically plays Kongzi was one of the brighter parts of the film. His body language at the beginning of the film shows perfectly a man who is aware of his greatness trying to appeal to his lessors through humility. This changes as Kongzi matures his philosophy and himself.There were other concerns brought up by critics concerning Chow, tied to his action movie past. In the film there are a few action sequences. This shouldn't surprise anyone familiar with Chinese history. The times in which Kongzi lived were violent and politically chaotic. Wars, small skirmishes, displays of force, rebellions and outright conquering were all very common. Kongzi got involved in a few of these types of events as an advisor to Duke Ding, so of course this was shown in the movie. Many felt that this was lowering the imagine and story of the Sage to that of a action flick brawler. To be honest, I disagree. In the film Kongzi rarely takes direct action in the fighting, he is giving commands or in some other way witnessing the violence, not swinging his sword around. He displays talent at archery but that was something recorded in history that was attributed to him, as was his zither playing. In all I believe the critics are taking a movie too seriously. While this movie is not a history lesson it is a good place for beginners of ancient Chinese history to get an entertaining introduction to what Kongzi's life may have looked like. After this I would recommend academic level books.",4,Bringing a Sage to Life,1360540800,"02 11, 2013",2013,4848,"['have', 'always', 'been', 'critical', 'historical', 'films', 'have', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'supported', 'many', 'are', 'sometimes', 'door', 'person', 'become', 'familiar', 'aspect', 'history', 'might', 'dare', 'suggest', 'lead', 'reading', 'book', 'Taking', 'figure', 'Kongzi', 'biographical', 'movie', 'risk', 'provide', 'something', 'real', 'accessible', 'viewers', 'produce', 'misleading', 'bit', 'fantastical', 'myth', 'Indeed', 'was', 'still', 'much', 'debate', 'interpretation', 'Master', 'Sage', 'was', 'please', 'find', 'production', 'firmly', 'planted', 'solid', 'reason', 'only', 'little', 'embellishments.The', 'film', 'are', 'major', 'events', 'Kongzi', 'life', 'minus', 'much', 'myth', 'surrounding', 'birth', 'texts', 'straight', 'Greek', 'myth', 'skips', 'right', 'well', 'know', 'period', 'when', 'was', 'advisor', 'Duke', 'Ding', 'Lu', 'period', 'life', 'beginning', 'film', 'showing', 'successes', 'advisor', 'how', 'made', 'enemies', 'powerful', 'family', 'clans', 'mostly', 'ran', 'state', 'film', 'Kongzi', 'exiled', 'Lu', 'Middle', 'Kingdom', 'looking', 'employment', 'band', 'followers', 'famous', 'meetings', 'Kongzi', 'had', 'power', 'how', 'destitute', 'followers', 'become', 'traveling', 'countryside', 'as', 'well', 'appointments', 'government', 'posts', 'followers', 'win', 'Eventually', 'film', 'story', 'full', 'circle', 'only', 'Kongzi', 'be', 'content', 'teaching', 'writing', 'now', 'famous', 'Annuls.How', 'film', 'quite', 'stunning', 'costumes', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'showing', 'high', 'degree', 'accuracy', 'as', 'well', 'sets', 'viewer', 'given', 'good', 'sense', 'how', 'advanced', 'ancient', 'China', 'really', 'was', 'technology', 'decorations', 'shown', 'importance', 'show', 'Kongzi', 'was', 'not', 'speaking', 'world', 'filled', 'people', 'incapable', 'understanding', 'educated', 'develop', 'people', 'could', 'weight', 'words', 'value.There', 'are', 'many', 'great', 'actors', 'film', 'especially', 'played', 'Kongzi', 'followers', 'Ren', 'Quan', 'Yan', 'Hui', 'worthy', 'note', 'playing', 'out', 'young', 'man', 'steadfast', 'loyalty', 'Master', 'suffer', 'more', 'Master', 'setbacks', 'Kongzi', 'Many', 'actors', 'play', 'out', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'loss', 'suffering', 'very', 'well', 'tears', 'welling', 'up', 'wails', 'despair', 'best', 'classical', 'Chinese', 'cinematic', 'tradition', 'However', 'great', 'others', 'are', 'film', 'had', 'rest', 'one', 'actor', 'was', 'whoever', 'played', 'Kongzi', 'tall', 'frame', 'Chow', 'Yun-fat', 'held', 'up', 'well', 'carrying', 'weight', 'Chinese', 'history', 'portrayed', 'well', 'balanced', 'blend', 'humility', 'knowledge', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'only', 'real', 'compliant', 'arrogance', 'younger', 'Kongzi', 'was', 'said', 'possess', 'not', 'shown', 'here.There', 'were', 'many', 'doubters', 'when', 'Chow', 'was', 'announced', 'play', 'Kongzi', 'People', 'felt', 'native', 'Cantonese', 'speaker', 'would', 'distort', 'Mandarin', 'would', 'have', 'speak', 'thus', 'making', 'Kongzi', 'sound', 'intelligent', 'Not', 'being', 'fleunt', 'languages', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'Chow', 'always', 'had', 'presence', 'one', 'things', 'enjoy', 'most', 'movies', 'have', 'never', 'felt', 'was', 'actor', 'play', 'role', 'actor', 'play', 'right', 'roles', 'ones', 'commanded', 'presence', 'How', 'Chow', 'physically', 'Kongzi', 'was', 'one', 'brighter', 'parts', 'film', 'body', 'language', 'beginning', 'film', 'perfectly', 'man', 'who', 'aware', 'greatness', 'trying', 'appeal', 'lessors', 'humility', 'Kongzi', 'philosophy', 'himself.There', 'were', 'other', 'concerns', 'brought', 'up', 'critics', 'concerning', 'Chow', 'tied', 'action', 'movie', 'past', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'action', 'sequences', 'should', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'Chinese', 'history', 'times', 'Kongzi', 'lived', 'were', 'violent', 'politically', 'chaotic', 'Wars', 'small', 'skirmishes', 'displays', 'force', 'rebellions', 'outright', 'conquering', 'were', 'very', 'common', 'Kongzi', 'got', 'involved', 'few', 'types', 'events', 'advisor', 'Duke', 'Ding', 'course', 'was', 'shown', 'movie', 'Many', 'felt', 'was', 'lowering', 'imagine', 'story', 'Sage', 'action', 'flick', 'brawler', 'be', 'honest', 'disagree', 'film', 'Kongzi', 'rarely', 'direct', 'action', 'fighting', 'giving', 'commands', 'other', 'way', 'witnessing', 'violence', 'not', 'swinging', 'sword', 'around', 'talent', 'archery', 'was', 'something', 'recorded', 'history', 'was', 'attributed', 'was', 'zither', 'playing', 'believe', 'critics', 'are', 'taking', 'movie', 'too', 'seriously', 'movie', 'not', 'history', 'lesson', 'good', 'place', 'beginners', 'ancient', 'Chinese', 'history', 'get', 'entertaining', 'introduction', 'what', 'Kongzi', 'life', 'may', 'have', 'looked', 'would', 'recommend', 'academic', 'level', 'books']",N/A

Chow Yun-Fat is Confucius (551-479 BC), a Chinese politician, writer and philosopher whose eventful life story is chronicled in this so-so bio-pic that is beautiful to look at, but lacks compelling narrative.Confucius was in the center of political intrigues in the court of the small kingdom of Lu, before enduring the long years of living in exile that started in his mid-fifties. The story, which should be dramatic and emotional with charismatic Chow Yun-Fat in the titular role, turned out disappointingly dry and unappealing due to the film's too earnest approach to the subject matter, which is like reading a beautifully printed textbook with too many footnotes.Though Chow Yun-Fat as always delivers a solid performance as a wise philosopher and able war tactician, whose ideas often clash with the political rulers', the unfocused script does not know what to tell in the right order. There are too many characters in the film that is busy trying to include in its uneven narrative everything about the protagonist including Confucius' imaginary dialogue with Lao Tzu.I know the film is trying to be historically accurate, but reading subtitles like - `During Ding's reign, power in the Kingdom of Lu has devolved to three aristocratic clans, known as ""The Three Noble Families"": the Jishi, Shushi and Mengshi clans' - is too much for the uninitiated in Chinese history.
