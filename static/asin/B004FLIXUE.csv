The movie was supposed to be about online dating and killers, but it never hit on all cylinders with that theme, so the name was changed to fit the movie they made. (Not a good sign.)James Ray plays a psychotic killer. He is a young buff version of G. Gordon Liddy. He doesn't kill to make skin masks, but rather to just thin out the herd of human existence to make room on the planet. He does this from his desert home. Kathleen Benner plays Valora Smith, a woman he has abducted. He has a fancy for her, so he doesn't kill her, but attempts to get her to like him...in his own way. Valora sports a t-shirt that reads, ""Some call it stalking, I call it love."" She is not very likable either, and seriously lacks personality. She relies on memories from growing up with grandpa (a John Wayne type) to give her strength and at times guidance.Occasional f-bomb, sexual situations (no rape) and nudity- Earl's butt.",2,"SOME CALL IT STALKING, I CALL IT LOVE",1304035200,"04 29, 2011",2011,947,"['Originally', 'released', 'Match.dead', 'movie', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'online', 'dating', 'killers', 'never', 'hit', 'cylinders', 'theme', 'name', 'was', 'changed', 'fit', 'movie', 'made', 'Not', 'good', 'sign', 'James', 'Ray', 'psychotic', 'killer', 'young', 'buff', 'version', 'G.', 'Gordon', 'Liddy', ""n't"", 'kill', 'make', 'skin', 'masks', 'rather', 'just', 'thin', 'out', 'herd', 'human', 'existence', 'make', 'room', 'planet', 'desert', 'home', 'Kathleen', 'Benner', 'Valora', 'Smith', 'woman', 'abducted', 'fancy', ""n't"", 'kill', 'attempts', 'get', 'like', 'own', 'way', 'Valora', 'sports', 't-shirt', 'call', 'stalking', 'call', 'love', 'not', 'very', 'likable', 'seriously', 'personality', 'memories', 'growing', 'up', 'grandpa', 'John', 'Wayne', 'type', 'give', 'strength', 'times', 'guidance.Occasional', 'f-bomb', 'sexual', 'situations', 'rape', 'nudity-', 'Earl', 'butt']",N/A
