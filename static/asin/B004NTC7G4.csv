Or the overly familiar scene of the twosome parasailing (from the sharks point of view......oh look, they're dangling live bait in the water!  Snacks on a rope.).

1422435,A1A535W556ROBQ,B004NTC7G4,James Ferguson,"[0, 0]","Quite possibly the worst shark movie ever made.  Not only is the idea so far-fetched as to be totally incredulous, but it is so poorly acted and executed that you wonder who would have ever given a green light for this film.  Goblin sharks are rare but not thought to be extinct.  A Georgia shrimper caught one not so long ago.  They are pink and flabby with a small dorsal fin and feed mostly off crustaceans, hence this one found itself snagged in a shrimp net.  But, I suppose the idea of a ""goblin"" shark sounded like it came from the bowels of hell, stirred up by a poor CGI tsunami to terrorize folks on a Malibu beach.Of course the one person who knows anything about goblin sharks is one of the first to go.  This isn't an environmental awareness film.  What follows is one of the most silly chain of events I've ever seen.  It would be amusing if it had been more campy, but everyone seemed to take themselves so seriously.  You need someone like Jim Varney in a film like this.  Instead, we get Peta Wilson, who must be scraping the bottom of the barrel to get involved in this fiasco.SyFy channel is nothing like the old Sci-Fi channel.  It has become the brunt of jokes, including Stephen Colbert.

This is an entirely derivative plot with a little Jaws, a little Bay Watch, and a little nothing in particular to recommend it. Having said that, I did enjoy it anyway.

And not just because as you get older, you resemble more and more a co-worker on whom I had a raging crush many years ago. (Okay, no, that is the only reason.) Including unbearable dreck like Malibu Shark Attack, a movie so monstrously stupid it should come with a Surgeon General's warning that it kills brain cells. I must say, however, that my opinion of this movie would have been entirely changed had the question ""what is that?"" been answered with ""really bad animatronic effects, duh!"". But alas, such was not to be.Wilson (La Femme Nikita--the TV show, not the movie) plays Heather, the leader of a Baywatch-style crew of lifeguards on the Malibu beach. There's some stuff about underwater earthquakes, and some stuff about dolphin sharks, and needless to say, it's the lifeguards vs. the sharks, with some other silly subplots thrown in for good measure (what's a big-nasty-animal movie without, for example, a ruthless developer?). Not that it matters, given that the main plot is brain-dead in the first place (seriously, sharks vs. lifeguards is the whole thing).
