Yes Prime Minister picks up where Yes Minister left off. The premise is that the PM resigns mid-term, and a new PM is needed. A recently promoted Sir Humphrey Applebee determines there is only one person who can project the image needed yet he can control... Jim Hacker! You will see many wonderful and new looks into the political scene - yet never stating any party affiliation.Included in this set is what I feel is the funniest episode of the series where Jim Hacker is about to hold his first press conference.

759374,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,B00009XN37,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[15, 15]","At almost 20 years old now, this award winning series still represents the finer aspects of great British comedy. Set in the 80's in which it was made, it satirically mirrors the politics of the era with a wry and subtle genius that is a joy to behold. All that said, a little familiarity with British politics, or the British culture in general helps tremendously. I am not surprised at the success of this series here in the States, but the uninitiated viewer may be being sold a little short on the finer aspects of the characters, and the dry humor. Jim Hacker (Paul Eddington) is the central character (following on from the Yes Minister series) thrust almost unwittingly into the limelight of the Prime Ministerial race, and sets about running the country with the same graceful ineptitude he applied to his previous ministerial post in the deparment of administrative affairs. Nigel Hawthorne is masterful as ""Sir Humphrey"" his ""advisor"" and head of the civil service who has his own agenda throughout, and plays all sides against the middle with varying levels of success. The final main Character is Hackers private secretary Bernard (Derek Fowlds) who often naively walks a middle line between helping the PM, but always being aware of his own allegiances to Humphrey (being a civil servant himself). This set begins with Hackers rise to power, and then contains all the subsequent episodes where the three characters play out some hilarious, and often thought provokingly satirical situations in a balanced and polished collection. Being a topically based political comedy obviously has its pitfalls, and those too young to remember the ""Thatcher"" years of British government, soviet spies, and the peaks and troughs of the economy during the 80's may view this a somewhat bland. I'm not suggesting for one minute that ANY viewer would not find great comedy in watching this collection, but it has to be said that it will almost certainly appeal to a narrower audience ultimately. Lots of extra's on the DVD collection and BBC video are to be congratulated on the excellent picture and sound quality of the presentation. Maybe not a ""timeless"" comedy, but a brilliant one none the less.

At odds with him is the cabinet secretary and head of the home civil service, Sir Humphrey Appleby.

And poor, poor Bernard Wooley, the PM's Principal Private Secretary, technically a civil servant but also a servant of the Prime Minister is always caught between them in their struggles for dominance.The series is hilarious, and my favorite episode is ""A Diplomatic Incident"" where the French try to present the Queen of England with a puppy as a gift at a state funeral (which would violate the nation's quarantine laws and therefore create a diplomatic incident) to get their way over the Channel-Tunnel negotiations.

From ""Yes, Minister"", Hacker's role has changed.  Instead of fighting the civil servants in his department, protecting his turf from his fellow cabinet colleagues, and appeasing the Prime Minister, Hacker as PM has only one objective: create his place in history.  Of course, he needs also to get re-elected.  The traditional conflict between the elected politicians, who think that they run the country, and the un-elected civil service, who more or less run the country, evolves further.  The political humor gets deeper and the policy issues discussed in these series range from the health effects of tobacco to appeasing all  the ""Continent"".Paul Eddington's performance as an incompetent minister and later prime minister were so admired by Margaret Thatcher that she awarded him the honor of Commander of the order of the British Empire in 1987.This BritCom is very highly recommended to anyone, even to those who may find this genre somewhat distant.",5,A masterpiece,1144713600,"04 11, 2006",2006,1472,"['political', 'junkies', 'recommend', 'Yes', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'possible', 'substitute', 'cancelled', 'West', 'WingThe', 'sequel', 'Yes', 'Minister', 'also', 'filled', 'razor-sharp', 'political', 'humor', 'superb', 'acting', 'Paul', 'Eddington', 'Jim', 'Hacker', 'PM', 'very', 'funny', 'constantly', 'odds', 'chief', 'civil', 'servant', 'Sir', 'Humphrey', 'Appleby', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Nigel', 'Hawthorne.The', 'show', 'cynical', 'realistic', 'very', 'entertaining', 'look', 'politics', 'politicians', 'general', 'British', 'particular', 'Yes', 'Minister', 'Hacker', 'role', 'changed', 'Instead', 'fighting', 'civil', 'servants', 'department', 'protecting', 'turf', 'fellow', 'cabinet', 'colleagues', 'appeasing', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Hacker', 'PM', 'only', 'one', 'objective', 'create', 'place', 'history', 'course', 'also', 'get', 're-elected', 'traditional', 'conflict', 'elected', 'politicians', 'who', 'think', 'run', 'country', 'un-elected', 'civil', 'service', 'who', 'more', 'less', 'run', 'country', 'further', 'political', 'humor', 'deeper', 'policy', 'issues', 'discussed', 'series', 'range', 'health', 'effects', 'tobacco', 'appeasing', 'Continent', '.Paul', 'Eddington', 'performance', 'incompetent', 'minister', 'later', 'prime', 'minister', 'were', 'so', 'admired', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'awarded', 'honor', 'Commander', 'order', 'British', 'Empire', '1987.This', 'BritCom', 'very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'even', 'who', 'may', 'find', 'genre', 'somewhat', 'distant']","Yes, Prime Minister: The Complete Collection"

Sir Humphrey is appointed Secretary to the Cabinet, replacing Sir Arnold (John Nettleton), and uses his position to maneuver the malleable Jim Hacker into Number 10. As PM, Hacker confronts issues such as Britain's nuclear deterrent, budget cuts, a complacent Foreign Office, appointing a Bishop, covering up a Soviet mole in MI5 during the Cold War, unemployment, bailing out an investment bank, making local government accountable, and coping with an potential international incident involving a puppy that France is using for leverage.The funniest episodes are often the backroom power struggles, as when Sir Humphrey and the PM's sharp political advisor Dorothy Wainwright (Deborah Norton) fight over office space and influence, or when Sir Humphrey and Permanent Secretary of the Treasury Sir Frank (Peter Cellier) compete to be head of the civil service, or when the preceding PM makes unkind comments about Hacker in his memoirs. Writers Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn felt that the series would be too predictable if Sir Humphrey was always able to outwit Hacker, so, in ""Yes, Prime Minister"", Hacker sometimes uses the weight of his office to beat Humphrey at his own game. Out of 17 episodes, I observed that Sir Humphrey takes the day in 8 and the PM in 6. In the others, their interests are aligned.This back-and-forth works well, not only because it is unpredictable, but because Jim Hacker is transformed from a hapless, well-intentioned MP to a pompous, self-important PM. The position has gone to his head. He's convinced that anything that might embarrass him will undermine the fabric of government. He is more frank, cynical, and interested in preserving the status quo than he was as an MP. In a way, this is not as funny, but, curiously, it posits that the PM may not have much power, after all, as he is more vulnerable to public opinion. For those who loved Sir Arnold in ""Yes, Minister"", he is back for 5 episodes. Sir Frank features in a few episodes. And Dorothy Wainwright is frequently the source of the PM's better ideas. Worth buying so you can watch it more than once.The DVDs (BBC Warner 2003): This is a 3-disc set. My one complaint is that the volume must be turned unusually high to hear the dialogue clearly, as the laugh track is too loud in comparison. There are 7 bonus features. ""Funny Turns: Paul Eddington: A Life Well-Lived"" (26 min) is a BBC special about Eddington's life and career, made after his death in 1995, that interviews his wife Patricia and his closest colleagues about his long career and his final illness. ""Christmas at the Ministry"" (2 min) is a short sketch that aired on BBC-1 in 1982. ""Cabinet Minister Sound Bytes/Jonathan Lynn Interview"" (12 min) is an excerpt of a BBC program that interviewed Lynn and a number of former MPs in 1986 on the debut of the new series. ""Paul Eddington Interview"" (9 min) was done by his friend the actress Felicity Kendal in 1986. ""No, Prime Minister"" is a text review by Sir Humphrey of Hacker's diaries. There are text bios and filmographies for the writers and 16 members of the cast.

759420,AD39QGHGWAOPQ,B00009XN37,"mwreview ""mwreview""","[69, 73]","--Sir Humphrey.  The Yes, Minister episodes continue with Jim Hacker moving to #10 Downing Street, bringing along private secretary Bernard and, of course, reuniting with the newly promoted Sir Humphrey (whose sentences seem to get longer with each episode).  The audio level is better on this set than on the previous one.  The cover artwork is not as clean (there are scan lines through the images), but the back cover is very nice with new photos of the three main characters (no photos on the inside as there were in the previous 4-CD set).The 17 brilliant episodes begin with the 1984 1-hour Christmas special that illustrated the chain events elevating Hacker to #10.  The special features include the Sir Humphrey's lengthy review of  the Yes Minister Diaries, &quot;Christmas at the Ministry&quot; clip, a 1986 Paul Eddington interview, Jonathan Lynn interview, and profiles on the main actors as well as others. A touching biography of Paul Eddington (Nigel Hawthorne was featured in the first set) in also included.  The bio includes scenes from 1950s Dixon of Dock Green, Adventures of Robin Hood, and many scenes from The Good Life and some insight on what Margaret Thatcher thought of Prime Minister Hacker.  Eddington's wife, Felicity Kendal, Hawthorne, and Derek Fowlds are among those interviewed.  It also includes very sad clips of one of Eddington's last interviews when he was suffering through the last stages of the skin cancer that took his life.  He handled his illness with much courage and the interviews with his friends and family reveals how fondly he is remembered and how many lives he touched.  This set is a must-have for Yes, Minister fans.

My wife had seen both series back in the '80s on TV. She raved about it, so we searched and found both of them. The acting is excellent, the comedy is constant, and fans of British TV shows will recognize many of the supporting characters, who have gone on to careers in many other TV series and some movies, as well. The DVD of YPM also has ""Extras"" that include interviews with some of the main characters - one of whom has since passed away.I find it to have been ""prophetic"" in its criticism and caricature of what happens when a nation has a ""big government"" perspective. Every episode offers explanations as to how ""big government"" comes about - and how it is maintained and expanded. All presented as some of the best comedy ever presented on TV.I highly recommend both ""Yes, Prime Minister"" and ""Yes, Minister"" to anyone who is interested in comedic political commentary that STILL TODAY relates to the policies and political atmosphere in the U.S. When I have more time, I want to send ""clips"" of their discussions of various governmental policies and issues to some of the U.S. talk show hosts.

759444,A2HM0AZ8WQFWU7,B00009XN37,Yoda,"[0, 0]","Yes Prime Minister is a very witty satire of, primarily, of the British Civil Service and political system (or at least of the time the show ran, which was the early to mid-1980s). However, it is more than that. It also satirizes, though to a smaller degree, other things British such as the class system, education and the arts (of the 1980s). As the show is quite subtle in its humor one does have to have an understanding of its topics to appreciate the series (i.e., role of the civil service in advising political figures, the English educational system, etc.). Hence many who are not familiar with these topics would not be able to appreciate the humor.The show is extremely witty and quite well written. It is the very epitome of well written satire. The ancient Greek playwright Euripides once said something to the effect that satire, to be truly successful, has to be almost indistinguishable from what it attempting to satirize. Yes Prime Minister, along with its predecessor, Yes Minister, manage to hit this nail right on the head. It is as if the writers of this series are Euripides incarnate.
