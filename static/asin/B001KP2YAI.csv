1208586,AWFA4158DDDWC,B001KP2YAI,Marney,"[0, 0]",Harlequin romances are all about the pretty unnoticed inhibited normal girl with an attitude that has never met the man of her dreams and tries unsuccessfully to control her emotions. This is claire. Her color seemed a little pale to me and the film seemed amateur at first but after awhile didnt notice this. This is one of my fav harlequin movies.,4,Good movie,1351296000,"10 27, 2012",2012,349,"['Harlequin', 'romances', 'are', 'pretty', 'unnoticed', 'inhibited', 'normal', 'girl', 'attitude', 'never', 'met', 'man', 'dreams', 'tries', 'unsuccessfully', 'control', 'emotions', 'claire', 'color', 'seemed', 'little', 'pale', 'film', 'seemed', 'amateur', 'first', 'awhile', 'didnt', 'notice', 'one', 'fav', 'harlequin', 'movies']",N/A

1208588,A3LNU3T5H9OMWC,B001KP2YAI,P. Romance,"[12, 12]","I loved it!  ""Diamond Girl"" represents what Harlequin is all about.I don't know how different this is from the original Diana Palmer's story since I haven't read it yet, but this movie was amazing on its own.  Regan and Denny Montana are perfect in their roles.  Not to appear superficial but the main heroes are very good-looking (which is a really added bonus).  I also like the fact that they are handsome in their own way, differentiating them, matching their roles.  Claire wasn't what I expected but she played off both men pretty well and loved her deadpan humor.  The acting was superb and the dialogue was funny, perfectly timed and witty.  Regan and Claire had nice chemistry but Claire lacked a little bit in her body language and emotions in some of their scenes together.  The minor characters were done really well.  I even wished there were more scenes with her brother and her friend.  There were a lot of parts in the movie that made me laugh out load, giggle or shake my head in disbelief.  The ending was really sweet.  This movie never lagged and every scene was an interesting one.There are a few kissing scenes and one sex scene near the end of the movie but nothing R rated.  It is in full screen and I noticed at two parts of the movie that were kind of blurry but nothing significant.  There are no extras on the DVD.All in all, for this price, this movie is definitely worth the entertainment value.  Definitely a keeper for my shelf.",5,I Love Regan!,1244678400,"06 11, 2009",2009,1460,"['loved', 'Diamond', 'Girl', 'what', 'Harlequin', 'about.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'different', 'original', 'Diana', 'Palmer', 'story', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'yet', 'movie', 'was', 'amazing', 'own', 'Regan', 'Denny', 'Montana', 'are', 'perfect', 'roles', 'Not', 'appear', 'superficial', 'main', 'heroes', 'are', 'very', 'good-looking', 'really', 'added', 'bonus', 'also', 'fact', 'are', 'handsome', 'own', 'way', 'differentiating', 'matching', 'roles', 'Claire', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'expected', 'played', 'off', 'men', 'pretty', 'well', 'loved', 'deadpan', 'humor', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'dialogue', 'was', 'funny', 'perfectly', 'timed', 'witty', 'Regan', 'Claire', 'had', 'nice', 'chemistry', 'Claire', 'lacked', 'little', 'bit', 'body', 'language', 'emotions', 'scenes', 'together', 'minor', 'characters', 'were', 'done', 'really', 'well', 'even', 'wished', 'were', 'more', 'scenes', 'brother', 'friend', 'were', 'lot', 'parts', 'movie', 'made', 'load', 'giggle', 'shake', 'head', 'disbelief', 'ending', 'was', 'really', 'sweet', 'movie', 'never', 'lagged', 'scene', 'was', 'interesting', 'one.There', 'are', 'few', 'kissing', 'scenes', 'one', 'sex', 'scene', 'end', 'movie', 'nothing', 'R', 'rated', 'full', 'screen', 'noticed', 'two', 'parts', 'movie', 'were', 'kind', 'blurry', 'nothing', 'significant', 'are', 'extras', 'DVD.All', 'price', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'entertainment', 'value', 'Definitely', 'keeper', 'shelf']",N/A
