713250,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00006FDBS,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[26, 33]","I am a little surprised that Harvard has not sued the makers of this film for associating the ivy-league college with such a horrible cinematic experience.  I, like many, sought this film out because Sarah Michelle Geller was in it; when I learned Rebecca Gayheart was also in the cast, I thought to myself: How bad can a film with both Geller and Gayheart be?  Let me tell you: pretty doggone bad.  First and foremost, the storyline and script are simply dreadful and ill-conceived, and these problems are only exacerbated by the prominence of some untalented actors in the cast.  Alan Grenier is Alan Jensen, supposedly the starting point guard on the Harvard basketball team, despite the fact that he is rather short, has no semblance of athletic skill, and really doesn't even try to look like he knows what he's doing when he's on the basketball court.  Honestly, this is one of the worst casting decisions I've ever seen.  Did I mention the fact that his acting skills also seem to be in short supply?  Sarah Michelle Gellar plays Cindy Bandolini, the unprincipled daughter of a mafia don and girlfriend of Alan; talk about your odd couple; several love scenes between the two are just icky.  Of course, our ruggedly unhandsome Alan is not content with Cindy; no, he is also sleeping with his philosophy professor Chesney Cort (played by the helium-voiced Joey Lauren Adams).Back in Kansas, a tornado destroys the home of Alan's parents, and he is determined to get the one hundred thousand dollars needed for them to rebuild.  In steps Cindy with a plan to make a killing off a sports bet; all Alan has to do is throw the big game against Dartmouth.  Soon, the FBI is nosing around, everybody sort of panics, hope rises in the viewer that at least one of these dreadful characters will die, and then a pretty impossible if not ludicrous ending is thrown together at the end.  You don't really even care how bad the conclusion is because you are just glad the film is finally over.I don't think I've ever seen a movie go to such lengths to annoy its audience.  Almost every scene features what I would call stop gaps; every few seconds, the film seems to jump a few frames for no reason whatsoever; this is a short-term technique that should be used sparingly, but the director of Harvard Man shot the entire movie this way, and it made me want to scream.  Then there is the music; it's just awful, and even worse it is constant and far too loud most of the time.  I guess a lot of it is supposed to sound Italian or something, even though the Mafia bit is not that important to the film.  The inclusion of Ray Allen, an actual basketball player, in the movie also makes no sense.  When Allen's character talks to Grenier, both of them seem to be in a race to see who can say his lines the fastest, and Allen tries so hard not to look like a professional basketball player that he ends up looking just as bad as everyone around him on the court.  Just when you think things can't possibly get any worse, we are taken along for an extended LSD trip in which all the voices the character hears building up inside his head assault our own ears as well in a rising crescendo.  This, in conjunction with all the other problems, qualifies this film as pure and utter torture.  I have no idea why Sarah Michelle Gellar chose to participate in Harvard Man, but it almost has to be a decision she now regrets.",2,Quite possibly the most annoying movie ever made,1063756800,"09 17, 2003",2003,3406,"['am', 'little', 'surprised', 'Harvard', 'not', 'sued', 'makers', 'film', 'associating', 'ivy-league', 'college', 'such', 'horrible', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'many', 'sought', 'film', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Geller', 'was', 'when', 'learned', 'Rebecca', 'Gayheart', 'was', 'also', 'cast', 'thought', 'myself', 'How', 'bad', 'can', 'film', 'Geller', 'Gayheart', 'be', 'Let', 'tell', 'pretty', 'doggone', 'bad', 'First', 'foremost', 'storyline', 'script', 'are', 'simply', 'dreadful', 'ill-conceived', 'problems', 'are', 'only', 'exacerbated', 'prominence', 'untalented', 'actors', 'cast', 'Alan', 'Grenier', 'Alan', 'Jensen', 'supposedly', 'starting', 'point', 'guard', 'Harvard', 'basketball', 'team', 'fact', 'rather', 'short', 'semblance', 'athletic', 'skill', 'really', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'look', 'what', 'doing', 'when', 'basketball', 'court', 'Honestly', 'one', 'worst', 'casting', 'decisions', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Did', 'mention', 'fact', 'acting', 'skills', 'also', 'seem', 'be', 'short', 'supply', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Cindy', 'Bandolini', 'unprincipled', 'daughter', 'mafia', 'don', 'girlfriend', 'Alan', 'talk', 'odd', 'couple', 'several', 'love', 'scenes', 'two', 'are', 'just', 'icky', 'course', 'ruggedly', 'unhandsome', 'Alan', 'not', 'content', 'Cindy', 'also', 'sleeping', 'philosophy', 'professor', 'Chesney', 'Cort', 'played', 'helium-voiced', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', '.Back', 'Kansas', 'tornado', 'home', 'Alan', 'parents', 'determined', 'get', 'one', 'hundred', 'thousand', 'dollars', 'needed', 'rebuild', 'steps', 'Cindy', 'plan', 'make', 'killing', 'off', 'sports', 'bet', 'Alan', 'do', 'throw', 'big', 'game', 'Dartmouth', 'Soon', 'FBI', 'nosing', 'around', 'everybody', 'sort', 'panics', 'hope', 'rises', 'viewer', 'least', 'one', 'dreadful', 'characters', 'will', 'die', 'then', 'pretty', 'impossible', 'not', 'ludicrous', 'ending', 'thrown', 'together', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'even', 'care', 'how', 'bad', 'conclusion', 'are', 'just', 'glad', 'film', 'finally', 'over.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'go', 'such', 'lengths', 'annoy', 'audience', 'scene', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'stop', 'gaps', 'few', 'seconds', 'film', 'jump', 'few', 'frames', 'reason', 'whatsoever', 'short-term', 'technique', 'should', 'be', 'used', 'sparingly', 'director', 'Harvard', 'Man', 'shot', 'entire', 'movie', 'way', 'made', 'want', 'scream', 'Then', 'music', 'just', 'awful', 'even', 'worse', 'constant', 'far', 'too', 'loud', 'most', 'time', 'guess', 'lot', 'supposed', 'sound', 'Italian', 'something', 'even', 'Mafia', 'bit', 'not', 'important', 'film', 'inclusion', 'Ray', 'Allen', 'actual', 'basketball', 'player', 'movie', 'also', 'sense', 'When', 'Allen', 'character', 'talks', 'Grenier', 'seem', 'be', 'race', 'see', 'who', 'can', 'say', 'lines', 'fastest', 'Allen', 'tries', 'so', 'hard', 'not', 'look', 'professional', 'basketball', 'player', 'up', 'looking', 'just', 'as', 'bad', 'everyone', 'court', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'get', 'worse', 'are', 'taken', 'extended', 'LSD', 'trip', 'voices', 'character', 'hears', 'building', 'up', 'head', 'assault', 'own', 'ears', 'as', 'well', 'rising', 'crescendo', 'conjunction', 'other', 'problems', 'qualifies', 'film', 'pure', 'utter', 'torture', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'chose', 'participate', 'Harvard', 'Man', 'almost', 'be', 'decision', 'now']",N/A

713252,A13KXWTN0DT878,B00006FDBS,"Josh ""Josh""","[1, 2]","Honestly, the only reason for me seeing Harvard Man is the presence of Sarah Michelle Gellar in the film. I believe her being in the film is what actually sold the movie to a studio. Rightfully done, since she was the only entertaining part of the whole film. And even her performance was a bit weak.Harvard Man tells the story of a young Harvard student (Who is experimental with drugs, and is fairly promiscuous) who gets involved with a mob boss' daughter. When a bet is made between the two that leads to him throwing a highly important basketball game, all goes down hill. Fairly simple, yet I found myself losing the point of the story occasionally. Just why exactly did the FBI want with the Harvard guy? To have a link to the big mobster guy? Hm?Along with the dialogue, performances seem a bit rushed. The only one who seems to sit back and enjoy was Eric Stoltz. Not that he has much screen time. The main star here is Adrian Grier (Drive Me Crazy). I didn't enjoy his performance. Only when he was high off of 15,000 somethings of ecstasy was his performance even the least bit interesting. Sarah Michelle Gellar was great as always, and actually seemed to take the movie into her own hands. Joey Lauren Adams is undeniably cute, and she fairs well. Rebecca Gayheart was shortly seen, and her character just seemed off. And were the two Italian hitmen supposed to be for comedy relief? No, to me, they were just plain annoying.Hard to say if I'll ever sit through another watching of Harvard Man. Ever.

I am not, in common parlance, hot for Gellar (Alyson Hannigan's smile does it for me), but for those who check out ""Harvard Man"" specifically to enjoy the actress this film starts to deliver while the image on the screen is still blank.  However, it will not take long for you to figure out that Gellar is just eye candy in this film (even more so on the DVD) because the real focus is on the character of Alan Jensen (Adrian Grenier), the alter-ego of writer-director James Toback who takes a kitchen sink approach to loading problems on this particular Harvard student to make his life explode for our cinematic enjoyment.Alan is the point guard for Harvard's basketball team, who is ""seeing"" Cindy Bandolini (Gellar); she is not only a cheerleader at Holy Cross, but her father (Gianni Russo) is also the chief Mafioso for the Northeastern United States.  He is also seeing Chesney Cort (Joey Lauren Adams), a Harvard Philosophy professor with one of the more interesting lecturing voices in the history of academia.  But then Alan's life is disrupted by a tornado in Kansas that wipes out his family's uninsured home and a chemistry student friend who has baked up some new and improved LSD.  So Alan needs $100,000 and suggests to Cindy that maybe her father can float him a loan.  Cindy reports that this can happen, but Alan would have to do something in return and suddenly we are into the wonderful world of point shaving in the big Harvard-Dartmouth game.  If this was not enough fun, Alan pops the acid just as the FBI are about to make their presence known.  Almost all of the above action takes place to the accompaniment of music by J. S. Bach.""Harvard Man"" will remind you of some of Toback's earlier films, especially his first script for ""The Gambler"" and his 1987 ""The Pick-Up Artist.""  These a films where not only are we watching interesting things happening to the characters, but where the characters tend to explore themselves and their actions in great detail (a tendency that extends even to the Mutt and Jeff Mafia hitmen running around in a sub-plot).  For those of us who remember drug sequences from Sixties films trying to represent acid trips, ""Harvard Man"" is relatively tame and Toback ends up trying to pull a rabbit out of the hat at the end to set things right.  Still, Gellar actually does end up with more to do in this film than look good and the story managed to get Eric Stoltz, John Neville and N.B.A. superstar Ray Allen on board.  ""Harvard Man"" ends up being a high-paced roller coaster ride in which you have no idea how it is all going to play out, which is certainly nothing like being boring and predictable....",3,"Actually, Sarah Michelle Gellar is more than eye candy here",1047168000,"03 9, 2003",2003,2774,"['watched', 'movie', 'had', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'am', 'not', 'common', 'parlance', 'hot', 'Gellar', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'smile', 'who', 'check', 'Harvard', 'Man', 'specifically', 'enjoy', 'actress', 'film', 'deliver', 'image', 'screen', 'still', 'blank', 'However', 'will', 'not', 'take', 'long', 'figure', 'out', 'Gellar', 'just', 'eye', 'candy', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'DVD', 'real', 'focus', 'character', 'Alan', 'Jensen', 'Adrian', 'Grenier', 'alter-ego', 'writer-director', 'James', 'Toback', 'who', 'kitchen', 'sink', 'approach', 'loading', 'problems', 'particular', 'Harvard', 'student', 'make', 'life', 'explode', 'cinematic', 'enjoyment.Alan', 'point', 'guard', 'Harvard', 'basketball', 'team', 'who', 'seeing', 'Cindy', 'Bandolini', 'Gellar', 'not', 'only', 'cheerleader', 'Holy', 'Cross', 'father', 'Gianni', 'Russo', 'also', 'chief', 'Mafioso', 'Northeastern', 'United', 'States', 'also', 'seeing', 'Chesney', 'Cort', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'Harvard', 'Philosophy', 'professor', 'one', 'more', 'interesting', 'lecturing', 'voices', 'history', 'academia', 'then', 'Alan', 'life', 'disrupted', 'tornado', 'Kansas', 'out', 'family', 'uninsured', 'home', 'chemistry', 'student', 'friend', 'who', 'baked', 'up', 'new', 'improved', 'LSD', 'So', 'Alan', '100,000', 'Cindy', 'maybe', 'father', 'can', 'float', 'loan', 'Cindy', 'can', 'happen', 'Alan', 'would', 'have', 'do', 'something', 'return', 'suddenly', 'are', 'wonderful', 'world', 'point', 'shaving', 'big', 'Harvard-Dartmouth', 'game', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'fun', 'Alan', 'acid', 'just', 'FBI', 'are', 'make', 'presence', 'known', 'Almost', 'above', 'action', 'place', 'accompaniment', 'music', 'J.', 'S', 'Bach', 'Harvard', 'Man', 'will', 'remind', 'Toback', 'earlier', 'films', 'especially', 'first', 'script', 'Gambler', '1987', 'Pick-Up', 'Artist', 'films', 'where', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'watching', 'interesting', 'things', 'happening', 'characters', 'where', 'characters', 'tend', 'explore', 'actions', 'great', 'detail', 'tendency', 'even', 'Mutt', 'Jeff', 'Mafia', 'hitmen', 'running', 'around', 'sub-plot', 'who', 'remember', 'drug', 'sequences', 'Sixties', 'films', 'trying', 'represent', 'acid', 'trips', 'Harvard', 'Man', 'relatively', 'tame', 'Toback', 'up', 'trying', 'pull', 'rabbit', 'hat', 'end', 'set', 'things', 'right', 'Still', 'Gellar', 'actually', 'end', 'up', 'more', 'do', 'film', 'look', 'good', 'story', 'managed', 'get', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'John', 'Neville', 'N.B.A', 'superstar', 'Ray', 'Allen', 'board', 'Harvard', 'Man', 'up', 'being', 'high-paced', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'going', 'play', 'out', 'certainly', 'nothing', 'being', 'boring', 'predictable']",N/A

But when his parent's house is destroyed in a tornado Alan becomes desperate to raise enough money to buy them a new one. This is where Cindy comes in. She tells Alan that her father will give him the money as a gift. Alan later learns that as payback he must throw an upcoming basketball game. His morals won't let him but once he realizes that this is his only option he goes along with the plan.  What he doesn't count on is that Cindy is using him to make some cash for herself. Factor in Allan's drug use which he has stepped up to LSD, two FBI agents (Eric Stoltz and Rebecca Gayheart) who are into threesomes with Chesney and who want her to help them get Alan, and Al Franken in a funny cameo and the film becomes a confusing mess with far too much going on. That's exactly the way Toback likes it though. He likes throwing as many characters and plot points in the mix so that he, like Alan, can find some truth in things. The film is intelligently written and often stylishly directed. The performances are hit and miss: Grenier is occasionally good as Alan but most of his line readings are embarrassing, Gellar and Lauren Adams handle themselves quite well, Gayheart is okay in a limited role and Stoltz is quite amusing as a man who as one character puts it ""speaks in four different accents and walks with a limp"". The film is a good comedy/drama full of Toback's usual blend of sex, gambling, and philosophical debates. He provides his usual entertaining commentary in the DVD extras.",3,Not one of Toback's best but still interesting,1242345600,"05 15, 2009",2009,2047,"['Alan', 'Jensen', 'Adrien', 'Grenier', 'point', 'guard', 'Harvard', 'basketball', 'team', 'exciting', 'college', 'life', 'deeply', 'involved', 'philosophy', 'one', 'day', 'reach', 'other', 'side', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'inside', 'Helping', 'find', 'are', 'two', 'beautiful', 'women', 'Chesney', 'Court', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'philosophy', 'professor', 'Cindy', 'Bandolini', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'daughter', 'rumored', 'mob', 'boss', 'Alan', 'nothing', 'more', 'sleeping', 'getting', 'high', 'discussing', 'meaning', 'life', 'when', 'parent', 'house', 'destroyed', 'tornado', 'Alan', 'desperate', 'raise', 'enough', 'money', 'buy', 'new', 'one', 'where', 'Cindy', 'Alan', 'father', 'will', 'give', 'money', 'gift', 'Alan', 'later', 'payback', 'must', 'throw', 'upcoming', 'basketball', 'game', 'morals', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'once', 'only', 'option', 'along', 'plan', 'What', ""n't"", 'count', 'Cindy', 'using', 'make', 'cash', 'herself', 'Factor', 'Allan', 'drug', 'use', 'stepped', 'up', 'LSD', 'two', 'FBI', 'agents', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'Rebecca', 'Gayheart', 'who', 'are', 'threesomes', 'Chesney', 'who', 'want', 'help', 'get', 'Alan', 'Al', 'Franken', 'funny', 'cameo', 'film', 'confusing', 'mess', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'exactly', 'way', 'Toback', 'throwing', 'many', 'characters', 'plot', 'points', 'mix', 'so', 'Alan', 'can', 'find', 'truth', 'things', 'film', 'intelligently', 'written', 'often', 'stylishly', 'directed', 'performances', 'are', 'hit', 'miss', 'Grenier', 'occasionally', 'good', 'Alan', 'most', 'line', 'readings', 'are', 'embarrassing', 'Gellar', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'handle', 'quite', 'well', 'Gayheart', 'okay', 'limited', 'role', 'Stoltz', 'quite', 'amusing', 'man', 'who', 'one', 'character', 'four', 'different', 'accents', 'walks', 'limp', 'film', 'good', 'comedy/drama', 'full', 'Toback', 'usual', 'blend', 'sex', 'gambling', 'philosophical', 'debates', 'usual', 'entertaining', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'extras']",N/A

Annoyingly the sound track he picks to accompany this movie isn't always the best, using rap and hip hop music and playing it at the same time as classical pieces can be quite hard on the ears and very distracting from the dialog.Over all Harvard man is a film with plus and minus points, neither one really dominating (thus the three star rating) with a different leading man and better soundtrack music this could have been twice the film it already is.
