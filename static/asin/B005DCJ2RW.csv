1455146,A1EBOEB2DXOMIK,B005DCJ2RW,"Amazon Customer ""C. Dennis Moore""","[5, 6]","It's a curious thing at first, the fact that writer/director Tom Provost's directorial debut (his second filmed screenplay) starts with over 15 minutes of silence before anyone says a word.  But looking back, that silence sets the tone of the movie and establishes the situation, informing the character of ""the woman"", played by Mira Sorvino.The woman has come to her grandparents' cabin on a remote island to work.  I'm not sure what her work is, but she spends a lot of time, it looks like, copying things out of a book.  She spends her days and nights alone, in silence, coming here for the peace and quiet.  There's no electricity on the island, her bathroom is an outhouse.  The cabin is very nice, and incredibly cozy.  I would love to spend a week there.  It rains a lot, and it's chilly enough overall that she can keep a few fresh chickens in the shed out back and they'll be just fine.  She seems to have a pretty sweet setup going on.There is, however, the ghost that stands silently by and watches everything she does.  Shane West gives just about the most wooden performance he's ever given in his life, but this time I think it's on purpose, as his character never utters a word, rarely shows an emotional connection, but he does a boat load of acting with his eyes, and while I think he overplayed it a few times, for the most part, I liked his character.Then the woman's boyfriend, the man (no, they don't have names), shows up.  They're obviously in love but you can tell immediately she doesn't welcome the company.  She doesn't tell him to leave, and puts on a show of being happy he's there, but it's pretty obvious she came here for a reason, and company wasn't it.  She makes the best of it, though, getting some work done while he explores the island, taking hikes with him, showing him all of her favorite places to go when she was here as a child.  He proposes to her and she says yes, but almost immediately afterward her attitude changes.He asks her to show him how to light the stove and he'll cook for her, but she tells him if you're going to be here you need to learn to take care of yourself.She apologizes later for the outburst, but it happens again the next day after he's made dinner.  She doesn't want dinner, she wants to keep working, she never even asked him to come here in the first place.The man is taken aback and considers leaving the island, going back home and letting her do her thing.  Even the ghost is confused.  Until he sees the man in black kneeling beside her, whispering words of discouragement in her ear.THE PRESENCE is a different kind of ghost story.  The ghost in this case isn't the antagonist, but rather serves as the viewer's gateway to seeing what's really going on.  The man in black, however, isn't a ghost, he seems to be something much more sinister, and he takes a great deal of pleasure in turning the woman against the man.Sorvino gives a solid performance as a woman with a tortured past, memories she doesn't want and is obviously constantly battling them and trying to be happy in the present.  Justin Kirk (""Weeds"") as the man plays his character like someone who is genuinely invigorated by his proximity to the woman he loves.  His life is going great and there's nothing that would please him more than to be able to share such joy with this woman who contributes so much to that happiness.Provost, as writer and director, is telling the story he wants to tell, and he made some very interesting choices in telling it.  I like the story, even if I don't fully understand it.  The ending was the weakest part with a terribly placed deux ex machina, but I think the story had written itself into a corner and at that point it was really six of one, half dozen of the other and ANY ending was probably going to be weak compared to the rest of the movie.For me, I'm most interested in these small set pieces, one or two locations, minimal characters, and a straightforward story that slowly, and very intelligently, reveals itself to have layer upon layer.  THE PRESENCE isn't played for scares, but for an overall uneasiness in the viewer.  Provost doesn't want to make us jump in our seats or make us have to turn on all the lights on the way to the bathroom; instead he wants us to question the very air next to us.  THE PRESENCE doesn't frighten, it creeps.  Not many movies can do that and I applaud it.  I think that terrible climax could have been fixed with but a few altered lines of dialogue from the man in black earlier in the movie, but overall I enjoyed this movie and found myself engaged and engrossed due to the tone and atmosphere Provost established, and was able to maintain throughout.

1455147,A2582KMXLK2P06,B005DCJ2RW,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","The Presence is such a weird movie.  It's not scary, suspenseful or interesting so it's kind of ruined.  For the first half you see a woman exploring her wild outdoor surroundings which presents a beautiful and realistic scenery.  However odd things occasionally happen.  For example while the woman is using the bathroom a rock is thrown directly at the outhouse.  A ghost probably did it... or a squirrel.  No it had to be a ghost (since squirrels can't throw objects like a baseball).She spends her days and nights listening to the same jazz music on her record player over and over while being nice and comfortable in her log cabin, all the while a pale-faced man roams through the house that we see from time to time.  Soon, after a visit from her neighbors courtesy of a boat ride across a beautiful lake out front, her boyfried arrives.  Make that her clueless boyfriend.  He can't even light a stove by himself.  Wow, what would happen if he ever had to survive on his own?  Those woods would own him.  At least he can propose right... oh wait, no he can't.  Something goes wrong there too.  Things go bump in the night when he has to take a number two and ventures out to use the outhouse, making this the first movie ever to focus on outhouse horrors... but no, unfortunately that's the end of the outhouse misadventures.  Darn, so much potential too.Anyway, about halfway through we find out the pale-faced man is a shy ghost that likes to concentrate really hard.  Soon, the presence of an angry ghost appears and influences the shy ghost to do bad things because doing so would give the shy ghost amazing powers.  Nothing better than feeling unstoppable.  Throughout the movie the shy ghost basically stands by as the mean ghost takes over the log cabin.  He's apparently taking over the way people feel too.  Hey, I bet it was the mean ghost who threw that rock at the outhouse earlier.  It couldn't have been the nice one.However it's never really stated why the woman occasionally lashes out at her husband so we're left to assume the mean ghost is responsible for this.  Eventually it spoils over into the woman being a complete emotional mess due to a tragic event involving her father not being a very good man when the woman was just a kid (apparently her dad abused her, maybe even worse things) and as a result her mind is completely messed up and assumes this boyfriend of hers is a no good scumbag.  Well he may be a really clueless guy but his heart is certainly in the right place- he seems very loyal and a perfect match, and his defense is logical and clear.  It's a shame she's so eager to throw it all away due to bad childhood memories coming back to haunt her.Anyway, eventually it's all about two ghosts battling over each others powers.  Bad choice of direction.  It's really not a very compelling movie to me.  Maybe to you or anyone looking for a different supernatural approach to the storytelling would appreciate this, but I prefer a more sensible approach to writing which this movie lacks.  For 85 minutes, it sure feels more like 125.  Two or three ghostly-related scares occur, and that's it.",2,ghostly battles,1372809600,"07 3, 2013",2013,3135,"['Presence', 'such', 'weird', 'movie', 'not', 'scary', 'suspenseful', 'interesting', 'kind', 'ruined', 'first', 'half', 'see', 'woman', 'exploring', 'wild', 'outdoor', 'surroundings', 'beautiful', 'realistic', 'scenery', 'However', 'odd', 'things', 'occasionally', 'happen', 'example', 'woman', 'using', 'bathroom', 'rock', 'thrown', 'directly', 'outhouse', 'ghost', 'probably', 'did', 'squirrel', 'had', 'be', 'ghost', 'squirrels', 'ca', ""n't"", 'throw', 'objects', 'baseball', '.She', 'days', 'nights', 'listening', 'same', 'jazz', 'music', 'record', 'player', 'being', 'nice', 'comfortable', 'log', 'cabin', 'pale-faced', 'man', 'house', 'see', 'time', 'time', 'Soon', 'visit', 'neighbors', 'courtesy', 'boat', 'ride', 'beautiful', 'lake', 'front', 'boyfried', 'arrives', 'Make', 'clueless', 'boyfriend', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'light', 'stove', 'Wow', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'ever', 'had', 'survive', 'own', 'woods', 'would', 'own', 'least', 'can', 'propose', 'right', 'oh', 'wait', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Something', 'wrong', 'there', 'too', 'Things', 'go', 'bump', 'night', 'when', 'take', 'number', 'two', 'ventures', 'out', 'use', 'outhouse', 'making', 'first', 'movie', 'ever', 'focus', 'outhouse', 'horrors', 'unfortunately', 'end', 'outhouse', 'Darn', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'too.Anyway', 'halfway', 'find', 'out', 'pale-faced', 'man', 'shy', 'ghost', 'concentrate', 'really', 'hard', 'Soon', 'presence', 'angry', 'ghost', 'shy', 'ghost', 'do', 'bad', 'things', 'doing', 'so', 'would', 'give', 'shy', 'ghost', 'amazing', 'powers', 'Nothing', 'better', 'feeling', 'unstoppable', 'movie', 'shy', 'ghost', 'basically', 'mean', 'ghost', 'log', 'cabin', 'apparently', 'taking', 'over', 'way', 'people', 'feel', 'too', 'Hey', 'bet', 'was', 'mean', 'ghost', 'who', 'threw', 'rock', 'outhouse', 'earlier', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'never', 'really', 'stated', 'why', 'woman', 'occasionally', 'out', 'husband', ""'re"", 'left', 'assume', 'mean', 'ghost', 'responsible', 'Eventually', 'woman', 'being', 'complete', 'emotional', 'mess', 'due', 'tragic', 'event', 'involving', 'father', 'not', 'being', 'very', 'good', 'man', 'when', 'woman', 'was', 'just', 'kid', 'apparently', 'dad', 'abused', 'maybe', 'even', 'worse', 'things', 'result', 'mind', 'completely', 'messed', 'up', 'boyfriend', 'hers', 'no', 'good', 'scumbag', 'may', 'be', 'really', 'clueless', 'guy', 'heart', 'certainly', 'right', 'place-', 'very', 'loyal', 'perfect', 'match', 'defense', 'logical', 'clear', 'shame', 'so', 'eager', 'throw', 'away', 'due', 'bad', 'childhood', 'memories', 'coming', 'back', 'haunt', 'her.Anyway', 'eventually', 'two', 'ghosts', 'battling', 'others', 'powers', 'Bad', 'choice', 'direction', 'really', 'not', 'very', 'compelling', 'movie', 'Maybe', 'anyone', 'looking', 'different', 'supernatural', 'approach', 'storytelling', 'would', 'appreciate', 'prefer', 'more', 'sensible', 'approach', 'writing', 'movie', '85', 'minutes', 'sure', 'more', '125', 'Two', 'three', 'ghostly-related', 'scares', 'occur']",Presence

1455156,A2ZAL8QPY3ABQH,B005DCJ2RW,Dustin J. Isenberg,"[4, 6]","I've been hearing lots of buzz about this movie and I was very eager to see it when it was released. I don't know if it was all the hype or it was me expecting a lot (or both)...but after watching the film I can't say I came away completely satisfied although pretty close. It definitely is a good movie which I will be revisiting but I feel like it was lacking something. This isn't your typical haunted house thriller but it did (very much) have a sense of dread to it. There are ghosts to be found here... not in the sense we normally expect... I guess that is why this film is being hailed as an ""innovative ghost story"". I really thought the concept behind this film was excellent and, for the most part, very well executed (especially for a first time director). What I did not like (without giving too much away) is how often the ghost was revealed in the beginning. I liked the fact that you go into the movie already experiencing the supernatural but not necessarily knowing what's going on. For the most part the scenes with the ghost are well-timed but I think, a little too much. It did make the film lose some of it's creepiness for me. I re-watched the film with the commentary and the director also noted that if he had a chance to go back, he'd make things even more subtle.  He did pull this idea off brilliantly towards the end when you meet the ""woodsman"" for the first time and I think maybe it was that inconsistency that made me scratch my head a bit. That really small quibble and my rambling aside, the cinematography and score were very stunning and really evoked a sense of isolation and dreed. Another thing that really was quite brilliant is the use of silence throughout the first 10-12 minutes of the movie. A very exceptional feat considering the concept and low budget of this film. I thought it was brilliant and made for more forboding and unknowing experience. The acting was also top notch. Mira Sorvino was perfectly cast as the lead character and you never feel like she is being over the top, especially when her realizations provide enough reason to be so. Also, I don't know if anybody else felt as creeped out about the damn outhouse as I did but it will definitely make me think twice about getting up in the middle of the night when I'm out camping anymore. For those who haven't seen yet, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about once you get to that scene. Human or not, I wouldn't appreciate anybody disturbing my most private of business. A lot of reviews for this movie stated how moving this film was and I will have to agree that it was in most aspects. I really did like the fact that all of this story's elements were based in reality and very real. It also seems to be as much a ghost story as well as a drama. It is about letting go as well as learning how to control your inner demons. The fx were used sparingly and the scares were genuine and I found none of them to be unnecessary. The end of the movie really was an ingenious spin on the ghost story and a breathe of fresh air. I think as a whole, everyone involved should be commended from the actors, to the production and (last but not least) the director! As I mentioned before, after watching the film, I watched it again with the director commentary and was very impressed by his enthusiasm for the supernatural genre and overall appreciation of films that have come before. He had a very honest and captivating story behind making the movie which I also advise people to check out. I am very excited to see what he will do next! Definitely recommend this to anybody with an open mind and wanting something different. WARNING: this film is a slow build and very subtle with scares but well worth the time investment. I warn because this may not be to everyone's taste. Regardless, I think everyone and anyone should give this movie a try.

1455171,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B005DCJ2RW,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 5]","An unnamed woman (played by Mira Sorvino) travels to a remote riverside cabin. Obviously she has a reason to live a seclude life, which we do not know for now. One thing is certain, however: someone else is also ""living"" in this cabin, stalking the woman day and night, though she doesn't seem to notice the presence of him.The cabin may be haunted by a creepy apparition with a grim look on his face, but ""The Presence"" is not exactly a ""haunted house"" themed movie like ""The Amityville Horror."" Sorvino's character may have some paranormal experiences, but she does not appear to be scared very much. One may argue that ""The Presence"" is not a horror movie. It is more like subversion of the genre conventions.The film makes some good points about so-called ""ghost stories."" A ghost doesn't have to be hostile to living humans. Also, the ghost (or whatever you call him/her) may be emotionally attached to someone else, like Patrick Swayze's character in a 1990 film ""Ghost."" Unlike the romantic drama, however, the supernatural existences in ""The Presence"" can do harms to the humans around them mentally or maybe physically.I like the basic idea of ""The Presence,"" as well as the film's beautiful photography and nice score, but unfortunately, the film doesn't have much to offer beyond that. Many scenes feel drawn out, especially the first 18 minutes, in which there is no dialogue at all. I like the film's experimental aspect of the narrative, which soon gets repetitious and boring. The acting of the players (all in six) including Mira Sorvino is just adequate.""The Presence"" is based on a premise stretched out beyond its limit, that is better suited for a short film or an episode for TV show.",3,(2.5 STARS) Interesting Concept Needs a Tighter Script,1346025600,"08 27, 2012",2012,1705,"['unnamed', 'woman', 'played', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'remote', 'riverside', 'cabin', 'Obviously', 'reason', 'live', 'seclude', 'life', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'now', 'One', 'thing', 'certain', 'however', 'someone', 'else', 'also', 'living', 'cabin', 'stalking', 'woman', 'day', 'night', ""n't"", 'seem', 'notice', 'presence', 'him.The', 'cabin', 'may', 'be', 'haunted', 'creepy', 'apparition', 'grim', 'look', 'face', 'Presence', 'not', 'exactly', 'haunted', 'house', 'themed', 'movie', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'Sorvino', 'character', 'may', 'have', 'paranormal', 'experiences', 'not', 'appear', 'be', 'scared', 'very', 'much', 'One', 'may', 'argue', 'Presence', 'not', 'horror', 'movie', 'more', 'subversion', 'genre', 'conventions.The', 'film', 'good', 'points', 'so-called', 'ghost', 'stories', 'ghost', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'hostile', 'living', 'humans', 'Also', 'ghost', 'call', 'him/her', 'may', 'be', 'emotionally', 'attached', 'someone', 'else', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'character', '1990', 'film', 'Ghost', 'romantic', 'drama', 'however', 'supernatural', 'existences', 'Presence', 'can', 'do', 'harms', 'humans', 'mentally', 'maybe', 'physically.I', 'basic', 'idea', 'Presence', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'nice', 'score', 'unfortunately', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'offer', 'Many', 'scenes', 'feel', 'drawn', 'out', 'especially', 'first', '18', 'minutes', 'dialogue', 'film', 'experimental', 'aspect', 'narrative', 'soon', 'repetitious', 'boring', 'acting', 'players', 'six', 'including', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'just', 'adequate', 'Presence', 'based', 'premise', 'stretched', 'out', 'limit', 'better', 'suited', 'short', 'film', 'episode', 'TV', 'show']",Presence

1455173,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B005DCJ2RW,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[0, 1]","If nothing else, this is certainly an interesting movie. It's paced extremely slowly and though it's presented as a horror movie I don't think I would categorize it that way. It's more of a ""supernatural drama"" if that's a category...The cinematography is impressive and though Conrad Pope's score starts off a bit overbearing (the first 15 minutes or so of the film are completely without dialogue so the score seems to be working overtime to provide an aural environment for the film), it winds up adding quite a bit of atmosphere, enhancing the slow pacing throughout.There's not much plot to speak of: The Woman (Mira Sorvino) seeks refuge for an unknown reason at a remote cabin where Ghost (Shane West) is already holed up alone. The Man (Justin Kirk) shows up to ask The Woman to marry him, but The Man in Black (Tony Curran) has other, more devious plans for the couple. The central theme here seems to be about eradicating painful memories and experiences (and perhaps spirits of those who still ""haunt"" us) so that we can move forward with our lives.Overall, I liked the implication that perhaps ghosts are simply issues in our own psyches that we need to work through, rather than separate entities. And I also appreciated the (mostly) subtle execution of the story. Unfortunately, the film suffers from a number of flaws: Sorvino is miscast, the script is quite painfully stilted throughout and the ending is entirely too heavy-handed after the subtlety of the rest of the film.Still, for a modestly budgeted film that never had an official theatrical release, it's not bad. For the record, Justin Kirk raises the quality of the film a full star.",3,Not bad for a modestly budgeted film with no theatrical release,1368316800,"05 12, 2013",2013,1658,"['nothing', 'else', 'certainly', 'interesting', 'movie', 'paced', 'extremely', 'slowly', 'presented', 'horror', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'categorize', 'way', 'more', 'supernatural', 'drama', 'category', 'cinematography', 'impressive', 'Conrad', 'Pope', 'score', 'bit', 'overbearing', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'so', 'film', 'are', 'completely', 'dialogue', 'score', 'be', 'working', 'overtime', 'provide', 'aural', 'environment', 'film', 'up', 'adding', 'quite', 'bit', 'atmosphere', 'enhancing', 'slow', 'pacing', 'not', 'much', 'plot', 'speak', 'Woman', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'refuge', 'unknown', 'reason', 'remote', 'cabin', 'where', 'Ghost', 'Shane', 'West', 'already', 'holed', 'up', 'alone', 'Man', 'Justin', 'Kirk', 'up', 'ask', 'Woman', 'marry', 'Man', 'Black', 'Tony', 'Curran', 'other', 'more', 'devious', 'plans', 'couple', 'central', 'theme', 'here', 'be', 'eradicating', 'painful', 'memories', 'experiences', 'perhaps', 'spirits', 'who', 'still', 'haunt', 'so', 'can', 'move', 'forward', 'lives.Overall', 'liked', 'implication', 'perhaps', 'ghosts', 'are', 'simply', 'issues', 'own', 'psyches', 'need', 'work', 'rather', 'separate', 'entities', 'also', 'appreciated', 'mostly', 'subtle', 'execution', 'story', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'suffers', 'number', 'flaws', 'Sorvino', 'miscast', 'script', 'quite', 'painfully', 'stilted', 'ending', 'entirely', 'too', 'heavy-handed', 'subtlety', 'rest', 'film.Still', 'modestly', 'budgeted', 'film', 'never', 'had', 'official', 'theatrical', 'release', 'not', 'bad', 'record', 'Justin', 'Kirk', 'quality', 'film', 'full', 'star']",Presence
