1434037,A1ZAYB88YRR93L,B004Z1HYBS,JeMicheSunshine,"[3, 3]","Maybe you are not use to viewing Black Americans in this sort of movie. Perhaps, you may never remember knowing or seeing a movie of this genre (at least in this century). But this is an amazingly quiet and beautiful movie that speaks of the human cross-roads that all of us will go through at some point in our lives. It quietly touches on the choices that we make in the face of adversity and the inevitability of death of someone that we love. It speaks quietly about how the human spirit can torture us when we have not been honest with ourselves, or are too late to make the change/take the chance that we could have/should have before losing someone forever. It speaks to the heartbreak of children to their parents, young people to their elders. It speaks to how sometimes, when death comes how badly we can behave. It speaks to how we can get sidetracked from who and what is really important in the grand scheme of things; and what the consequences of that action, that choice can be. It is a strong powerful movie that needs no apology for its story. It does not judge. The soundtrack is so very moving, soothing, melodically (is that even a word?)harmonious , and adds a perfect back-drop to the movie without over powering it; or intefering with what this movie expresses. The soundtrack enhances this movie exponentially!At this price point, it should be added to your dvd collection; and viewed with those that you love, that you may love, that you call friend, that you call family.

Now that Amanda has passed on, Maye must try to focus on important tasks that need to be handled.No explicit sex scenes. No bullets or F-bombs flying all over the place. No fist fights or killing. No car crashes. No explosions. This movie was interesting, enlightening, touching... calm.The main thing that came to mind as I watched: It's best to have a will, so family members don't argue over who gets what. But then again, they just might argue anyway.The guys from Goodwill were funny.The flashbacks helped me to understand the kind of relationship Maye had with her Aunt and to see the kind of woman Amanda was. (I liked those best)Maye's exchanges with Amanda's daughter, Fran (Michole Brianna White)weren't really intense, but did add a bit of drama.I Will Follow is about dealing with grief. It's about being comforted in time of sorrow. It's about selflessness and selfishness. It's about misunderstandings and family discord. It's about the expectations we have of others. It's about finding the strength to move on. It is a film worth watching.",3,"Interesting, Enlightening, Touching...

After watching it I did a little more research on DuVernay and found a review of this film by Roger Ebert saying it was the most sensitive film about loss he had ever seen. I agree. It never falls into pathos yet pulls the heart apart one string at a time, then rebuilds it back with the mortar of love. The family dynamics are beautifully written, directed, and acted from start to end credits. It's been several months since I viewed this film, yet it's still vivid in my mind, and that's saying something for a person dealing with sensory overload and constantly discarding everything that isn't wowza.DuVernay has seen been signed to direct major films with big studios.

1434048,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,B004Z1HYBS,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[19, 20]","Ava Duvernay's I Will Follow is a breath of fresh air in a stale period of African-American cinema. I Will Follow is a beautifully crafted film that features multidimensional characters, beautiful cinematography and a thought-provoking plot. I haven't seen a Black film made with this level of quality in over a decade. This is one of the best films of 2011.Salli Richardson-Whitfield gives one of her finest performances as Maye, the niece of Amanda, a background drummer for some of the most popular musicians of the70's and 80's. After taking a year off to care for her dying aunt, she has one day to pack up all the belongings in the home she shared with her and we watch as twelve strangers help her pack her belongings into a truck and help her move forward with her life.I Will Follow is a great movie. It's rare that we get to see these slices of African-American life presented onscreen, a film where we see African-Americans as multidimensional people, expressing themselves as human beings, not like caricatures and stereotypes. This is the kind of story about Black life we hear about all the time, but it's rarely ever shown onscreen in the media. It's very rare that Black actors are given material of this quality and an opportunity to perform playing multidimensional characters like this in today's media. This is the kind of African-American film I want to see made, and if I made films this would be the kind of film I would make.The screenwriting on this film is top notch. Many say Duvernay's story is slow, but I have no problem with the pacing of this movie. The storyline is very subtle and nuanced showing us those little things in life so many of us take for granted. It's the kind of story that can easily go over people's heads if they're not paying attention.I've always enjoyed Salli Richardson Whitfield's work. But she takes her craft to another level with her powerful performance in I Will Follow. Richardson effortlessly carries the film from fade in to fade out in her portrayal of Maye, a woman who has to hold it together in the face of so much. It's the little things in Richardson's performance that are great to watch in I Will Follow, the looks on her face, the way she carries herself with a quiet dignity, the way she conveys kindness and compassion as she handles a stressful situation. Richardson has great chemistry with every actor onscreen and makes us feel a connection to all the people who she interacts with throughout the day.The supporting cast is also very strong. Beverly Todd gives a dignified and elegant performance as Amanda, a woman who wants to end her life on her own terms. Michole Briana White is very strong as Fran, the Daughter who had a strained relationship with her mother, but is angry about the close relationship Amanda had with Maye. You feel her jealousy and anger at Maye throughout her time onscreen. When she and Richardson are on screen there's intensity and tension. Dijon Halton is solid in his role as Raven, a good kid who sticks around to help Maye. I love the conversation he has with Maye about Nas and Jay-z; it's the kind of conversation people have in real life. Omari Hardwick is solid as a potential love interest for Maye and Blair Underwood gives one of his strongest performances in a small role as Maye's former lover. There are so many great performances here, like the two Goodwill guys who add some humor and the Cancer Survivor who takes down the satellite dish adds some warmth and humanity. I wish I could mention everyone, because the entire cast does an amazing job of supporting this film.I really appreciate this film and what it represents historically for Black Cinema. I Will Follow was independently financed and independently produced. More importantly, it was the first Black film independently distributed to theaters by a black distributor. Made for just $50,000 and shot in just six days I Will Follow looks like a film that cost over $40 million minimum. The cinematography on this film is beautiful with serene shots and powerful visuals that tell a strong story the viewer will never forget. Duvernay tells a great story with her camera, and her first film has me eager to see more of her work.I Will Follow is a Shawn James Five Star Essential Video.
