Anderson,"[0, 1]","Having loved Our Gang since watching their short B/W films as a kid, and being an owner of the definitive Cabin Fever box DVD set, I was very skeptical about this product, and only decided to take a chance when I found them at a bargain, sale price.But I was extremely impressed with the results.  Colorization has come a LONG way since the early attempts that I recall seeing, with their overly-soft pictures, blurry outlines, and bland colors.  Legend has done an amazing job with these films, and -- were I not familiar with the originals -- I would in many cases not have guessed that they were not originally filmed in color.  The palettes they use are generally true and lifelike, but also period appropriate, and not so vivid as to be jarring.  I heartily agree with another reviewer who noted that she now notices a lot of details that had not stood out in the original, monochromatic presentation, which I would not have guessed until I saw it for myself.Whatever the film purist in me may think, the new, colorized versions are also FAR better at holding our kids' attention than the original black-and-white prints.So, particularly for the price, I strongly recommend giving these a try, even if you own the Cabin Fever/Vivendi B/W release.",5,I'm surprised how much I like this: Colorization has come a long way!,1353196800,"11 18, 2012",2012,1251,"['Having', 'loved', 'Gang', 'watching', 'short', 'B/W', 'films', 'kid', 'being', 'owner', 'definitive', 'Cabin', 'Fever', 'box', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'very', 'skeptical', 'product', 'only', 'decided', 'take', 'chance', 'when', 'found', 'bargain', 'sale', 'price.But', 'was', 'extremely', 'impressed', 'results', 'Colorization', 'come', 'LONG', 'way', 'early', 'attempts', 'recall', 'seeing', 'overly-soft', 'pictures', 'blurry', 'outlines', 'bland', 'colors', 'Legend', 'done', 'amazing', 'job', 'films', 'were', 'not', 'familiar', 'originals', 'would', 'many', 'cases', 'not', 'have', 'guessed', 'were', 'not', 'originally', 'filmed', 'color', 'palettes', 'use', 'are', 'generally', 'true', 'lifelike', 'also', 'period', 'appropriate', 'not', 'so', 'vivid', 'be', 'jarring', 'heartily', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'noted', 'now', 'lot', 'details', 'had', 'not', 'stood', 'out', 'original', 'monochromatic', 'presentation', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'guessed', 'saw', 'myself.Whatever', 'film', 'purist', 'may', 'think', 'new', 'colorized', 'versions', 'are', 'also', 'FAR', 'better', 'holding', 'kids', 'attention', 'original', 'black-and-white', 'prints.So', 'particularly', 'price', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'giving', 'try', 'even', 'own', 'Cabin', 'Fever/Vivendi', 'B/W', 'release']",The Little Rascals 3-pk - IN COLOR!

I like the fact that it is colorized or if you prefer you can also watch it in black and white. The stories are very cute and the kids are even cuter. So glad we bought this and I am sure the 6 & 10 year old grandsons will love it. The price was great as well there are 3 discs and quite a few episodes on them so lots of fun clean entertainment for the whole family.",5,ADORABLE!!!!,1354752000,"12 6, 2012",2012,499,"['remember', 'watching', 'Little', 'Rascals', 'kid', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'thought', 'grandkids', 'would', 'like', 'when', 'come', 'fact', 'colorized', 'prefer', 'can', 'also', 'watch', 'black', 'white', 'stories', 'are', 'very', 'cute', 'kids', 'are', 'even', 'cuter', 'So', 'glad', 'bought', 'am', 'sure', '6', '10', 'year', 'old', 'grandsons', 'will', 'love', 'price', 'was', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'are', '3', 'discs', 'quite', 'few', 'episodes', 'so', 'lots', 'fun', 'clean', 'entertainment', 'whole', 'family']",The Little Rascals 3-pk - IN COLOR!
