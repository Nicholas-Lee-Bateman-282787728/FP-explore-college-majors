It has some purposely lingering moments that develop a tension in a European way that pauses to capture a face at a certain moment.  (Which is not unlike Ingmar Bergman films in this sense.)  Although what I like about 'L'enfant' is that it is disturbing, but unique. The unthinkable happens and the main protagonist doesn't have the moral capacity to absorb the significance of his actions.  The movie is not unlike an urban 'Lord of the Flies' where the key players descend into a darkness that isn't apparent to them until society can descend upon them and bring their transgressions to the conscious level.That transgression happens between two, young French lovers, Bruno (Je're'mie Renier) and Sonia (Deborah Francois).  They have a baby, but their relationship is playful, like two children.  The full scope of their responsibilities hasn't hit them yet, especially for the immature Bruno.  He's unemployed and resorts to stealing, which he initiates with boys whose endearment isn't too far removed from Fagin in Dicken's 'Oliver'.  He's playful, too, with the boys, like an older brother, but his focus is mainly on his selfish interest for instant gratification.  In the beginning, Sonia carries their newborn son around and has trouble entering their apartment, which Bruno has sublet to pay some debts.  He quickly loses his black market money, which he mainly gets from drug deals and stolen merchandise.  His connection to his newborn son is flippant at best, and his naming him ""Jimmy"" seems like a careless afterthought.  After the reality of healthcare and housing sets in, Bruno sells Jimmy to the black market without even thinking to consult his young wife.  When the sale is complete, Sonia faints upon hearing the news.  Taking her to the hospital, he has jeopardized their relationship and his prospects to remain foot loose and fancy free.As awful as the plot seems, 'L'enfant' is startlingly original and consuming in its quest for us to understand the clueless protagonist, who can see life only on his terms.  There's a chase scene done with a mop-ed that reinvents the chase to the best of my knowledge, and some effective scenes of the estranged couple showing the effect of his choices.  Although not an easy movie to take in always, it remains a believable and disturbing portrait of immediate choices that parallel those made in the United States, but done with the distinction of French culture.  The resolution is satisfying for me to assuage my occasional suspicions that I was sometimes merely watching an unfolding soap opera with miserable circumstances.(The DVD extra has an enlightening interview between a French radio host and the directors Jean-Pierre Dardenne and Luc Dardenne.  It is a thoughtful and engaging discussion that leads me to believe the directors were not by any means trying to sensationalize a sensitive and sticky situation presented in the plot.  It clocks in at a half hour and is worth a look.  Philosophical and insightful, it sheds light on the creation of L'enfant like few extras do.)",4,L' enfant es Tre Bien,1166054400,"12 14, 2006",2006,3103,"[""L'enfant"", 'quickly', 'graps', 'keeps', 'interest', 'purposely', 'lingering', 'moments', 'develop', 'tension', 'European', 'way', 'capture', 'face', 'certain', 'moment', 'Which', 'not', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'sense', 'what', 'like', ""L'enfant"", 'disturbing', 'unique', 'unthinkable', 'happens', 'main', 'protagonist', ""n't"", 'have', 'moral', 'capacity', 'absorb', 'significance', 'actions', 'movie', 'not', 'urban', ""'Lord"", 'Flies', 'where', 'key', 'players', 'descend', 'darkness', ""n't"", 'apparent', 'society', 'can', 'descend', 'bring', 'transgressions', 'conscious', 'transgression', 'two', 'young', 'French', 'lovers', 'Bruno', ""Je're'mie"", 'Renier', 'Sonia', 'Deborah', 'Francois', 'have', 'baby', 'relationship', 'playful', 'two', 'children', 'full', 'scope', 'responsibilities', ""n't"", 'hit', 'yet', 'especially', 'immature', 'Bruno', 'unemployed', 'resorts', 'stealing', 'boys', 'endearment', ""n't"", 'too', 'far', 'removed', 'Fagin', 'Dicken', ""'Oliver"", 'playful', 'too', 'boys', 'older', 'brother', 'focus', 'mainly', 'selfish', 'interest', 'instant', 'gratification', 'beginning', 'Sonia', 'newborn', 'son', 'around', 'trouble', 'entering', 'apartment', 'Bruno', 'sublet', 'pay', 'debts', 'quickly', 'black', 'market', 'money', 'mainly', 'drug', 'deals', 'stolen', 'merchandise', 'connection', 'newborn', 'son', 'flippant', 'best', 'naming', 'Jimmy', 'careless', 'afterthought', 'reality', 'healthcare', 'housing', 'sets', 'Bruno', 'Jimmy', 'black', 'market', 'even', 'thinking', 'consult', 'young', 'wife', 'When', 'sale', 'complete', 'Sonia', 'hearing', 'news', 'Taking', 'hospital', 'jeopardized', 'relationship', 'prospects', 'remain', 'foot', 'loose', 'fancy', 'free.As', 'awful', 'plot', ""L'enfant"", 'startlingly', 'original', 'consuming', 'quest', 'understand', 'clueless', 'protagonist', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'life', 'only', 'terms', 'chase', 'scene', 'done', 'mop-ed', 'chase', 'best', 'knowledge', 'effective', 'scenes', 'estranged', 'couple', 'showing', 'effect', 'choices', 'not', 'easy', 'movie', 'take', 'always', 'believable', 'disturbing', 'portrait', 'immediate', 'choices', 'parallel', 'made', 'United', 'States', 'done', 'distinction', 'French', 'culture', 'resolution', 'satisfying', 'assuage', 'occasional', 'suspicions', 'was', 'sometimes', 'merely', 'watching', 'unfolding', 'soap', 'opera', 'miserable', 'circumstances', 'DVD', 'extra', 'enlightening', 'interview', 'French', 'radio', 'host', 'directors', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Dardenne', 'Luc', 'Dardenne', 'thoughtful', 'engaging', 'discussion', 'believe', 'directors', 'were', 'not', 'means', 'trying', 'sensationalize', 'sensitive', 'sticky', 'situation', 'presented', 'plot', 'half', 'hour', 'look', 'Philosophical', 'insightful', 'light', 'creation', ""L'enfant"", 'few', 'extras', 'do']",N/A
997952,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000G0O5IM,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","`L'enfant' contains a shocking moment in which new father (and petty thief), Bruno, sells his son Jimmy.  He returns to his girlfriend, Sonia, to nonchalantly give her the news and then offers up the money and the words ""I thought we'd have another"" as a form of comfort for her loss, a loss she had absolutely no say in.She faints.The film `L'enfant' is a gritty and disturbing look into the lives of the morally conflicted.  We are introduced to the couple shortly after the birth of their son.  Sonia is a nave and slightly immature teenager who completely buys into the inadequacies of her boyfriend Bruno.  She, apparently, has enough of a stable mind to hold some sort of a job (we are never informed as to `what' she does) but Bruno refuses to work, resorting to stealing for quick cash, of which is spends impulsively and rather stupidly.  The couple is carefree and it shows in the way they react to their current situation.  Bruno doesn't visit Sonia in the hospital, and he doesn't even care much for holding his own son.  Instead, Bruno looks for ways to make a buck, and if that means selling a child he doesn't want to have to work to support, so be it.This shocking moment happens about a half-hour into the movie.  Sonia, almost immediately, shifts from girl to woman, stirring up her maternal instincts of protection as she expels Bruno from her life.Bruno spends the rest of the film seeking out his own redemption.The films second half steps away from the literal `child' and focuses on the figurative `child'; Bruno.  We come to know and understand his mindset and his fears as he strives to find himself amidst his own selfish (and instinctual) impulses.  This is the story of one man's inability to find solace in his actions, a man in need of a serious readjustment.  The final frame, the emotional collapse, leads way to a glimmer of hope.  Maybe, just maybe, this young man has finally got it; but with that `hope' comes the doubt as to whether or not this sudden realization will actually `stick'.The ambiguities are haunting.The bare direction is stunning; the gritty and naturally realistic way in which the film is conveyed.  The acting is all stellar.  Both Jeremie Renier (not to be mistaken for the recently Oscar nominated Jeremy Renner) and Deborah Francois are simply brilliant here.  Renier understands the nuances needed to create a relatable and believable `villain'.  He is limited by his own selfish instincts, but he is notably trying.  There is a softness to him that perfectly underscores the fact that he means well, he just doesn't understand the consequences of his own actions.  Francois is marvelous here, especially in the way she handles her characters sudden yet wholly believable tonal shift.  Her collapse gave me chills.`L'enfant' is not an easy film to watch.  It is harsh (emotionally) and truly haunting.  It touches upon themes that are remarkably poignant and it is a film that feels so raw and real that it will leave you breathless.",5,Life lessons...,1268697600,"03 16, 2010",2010,2993,"[""L'enfant"", 'shocking', 'moment', 'new', 'father', 'petty', 'thief', 'Bruno', 'son', 'Jimmy', 'girlfriend', 'Sonia', 'nonchalantly', 'give', 'news', 'then', 'up', 'money', 'words', 'thought', ""'d"", 'have', 'form', 'comfort', 'loss', 'loss', 'had', 'absolutely', 'say', 'faints.The', 'film', ""L'enfant"", 'gritty', 'disturbing', 'look', 'lives', 'morally', 'conflicted', 'are', 'introduced', 'couple', 'shortly', 'birth', 'son', 'Sonia', 'nave', 'slightly', 'immature', 'teenager', 'who', 'completely', 'inadequacies', 'boyfriend', 'Bruno', 'apparently', 'enough', 'stable', 'mind', 'hold', 'sort', 'job', 'are', 'never', 'informed', 'what', 'Bruno', 'work', 'resorting', 'stealing', 'quick', 'cash', 'spends', 'impulsively', 'rather', 'stupidly', 'couple', 'carefree', 'way', 'react', 'current', 'situation', 'Bruno', ""n't"", 'visit', 'Sonia', 'hospital', ""n't"", 'even', 'care', 'much', 'holding', 'own', 'son', 'Instead', 'Bruno', 'ways', 'make', 'buck', 'selling', 'child', ""n't"", 'want', 'have', 'work', 'support', 'so', 'be', 'it.This', 'shocking', 'moment', 'half-hour', 'movie', 'Sonia', 'almost', 'immediately', 'shifts', 'girl', 'woman', 'stirring', 'up', 'maternal', 'instincts', 'protection', 'Bruno', 'life.Bruno', 'rest', 'film', 'seeking', 'out', 'own', 'redemption.The', 'films', 'second', 'half', 'steps', 'away', 'literal', 'child', 'focuses', 'figurative', 'child', 'Bruno', 'come', 'know', 'understand', 'mindset', 'fears', 'find', 'amidst', 'own', 'selfish', 'instinctual', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'inability', 'find', 'solace', 'actions', 'man', 'need', 'serious', 'readjustment', 'final', 'frame', 'emotional', 'collapse', 'way', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'Maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'young', 'man', 'finally', 'got', 'hope', 'doubt', 'not', 'sudden', 'realization', 'will', 'actually', ""stick'.The"", 'ambiguities', 'are', 'haunting.The', 'bare', 'direction', 'stunning', 'gritty', 'naturally', 'realistic', 'way', 'film', 'conveyed', 'acting', 'stellar', 'Jeremie', 'Renier', 'not', 'be', 'mistaken', 'recently', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Deborah', 'Francois', 'are', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'here', 'Renier', 'nuances', 'needed', 'create', 'relatable', 'believable', 'villain', 'limited', 'own', 'selfish', 'instincts', 'notably', 'trying', 'softness', 'perfectly', 'fact', 'well', 'just', ""n't"", 'understand', 'consequences', 'own', 'actions', 'Francois', 'marvelous', 'here', 'especially', 'way', 'characters', 'sudden', 'yet', 'wholly', 'believable', 'tonal', 'shift', 'collapse', 'gave', 'chills.', ""L'enfant"", 'not', 'easy', 'film', 'watch', 'harsh', 'emotionally', 'truly', 'haunting', 'themes', 'are', 'remarkably', 'poignant', 'film', 'so', 'raw', 'real', 'will', 'leave', 'breathless']",N/A
997953,AYP0Z0FLR9Z0R,B000G0O5IM,avoraciousreader,"[4, 4]","This film sneaks up on you.  About half-way through I put it aside and never got back to it, and would have been perfectly happy returning it unfinished.  But then I discovered I had another day, so finished watching it, and by the final scene I was crying with Bruno and Sonia.Sure, when the film starts out both Sonia (wandering around Seraing looking for her baby daddy) and Bruno are narcissistic, nearly emotionless, drifters, pretty but about as interesting as the flotsam by the canal that is a constant presence.  But the shocking central event, when Bruno sells their days-old infant to an illicit adoption ring, brings about transformation.  Sonia develops spine, resolve, purpose (primarily to have nothing to do with Bruno, who has crossed way over the line).  Bruno's comfortable (in its own way) life of petty crime spirals downward as he gets on the wrong side of some heavy, or at least heavier, hitters, and then a robbery goes drastically wrong.  But in the end, he has stepped up to the plate and done the right thing at least a couple of times.  Weak, but not mean, it seems Bruno may also be becoming a chordate.  The final scene ties it all together emotionally and leaves us with some hope, but not certainty, for Bruno and Sonia.I rate the film a bit shy of 5*, but will round up to compensate for some of the extremely negative reviews.",5,Quietly Affecting,1194393600,"11 7, 2007",2007,1361,"['film', 'up', 'half-way', 'put', 'aside', 'never', 'got', 'back', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfectly', 'happy', 'returning', 'unfinished', 'then', 'discovered', 'had', 'day', 'so', 'finished', 'watching', 'final', 'scene', 'was', 'crying', 'Bruno', 'Sonia.Sure', 'when', 'film', 'out', 'Sonia', 'wandering', 'Seraing', 'looking', 'baby', 'daddy', 'Bruno', 'are', 'narcissistic', 'nearly', 'emotionless', 'drifters', 'pretty', 'as', 'interesting', 'flotsam', 'canal', 'constant', 'presence', 'shocking', 'central', 'event', 'when', 'Bruno', 'days-old', 'infant', 'illicit', 'adoption', 'ring', 'transformation', 'Sonia', 'spine', 'resolve', 'purpose', 'primarily', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'Bruno', 'who', 'crossed', 'way', 'line', 'Bruno', 'comfortable', 'own', 'way', 'life', 'petty', 'crime', 'spirals', 'downward', 'wrong', 'side', 'heavy', 'least', 'heavier', 'hitters', 'then', 'robbery', 'drastically', 'wrong', 'end', 'stepped', 'up', 'plate', 'done', 'right', 'thing', 'least', 'couple', 'times', 'Weak', 'not', 'mean', 'Bruno', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'becoming', 'chordate', 'final', 'scene', 'ties', 'together', 'emotionally', 'hope', 'not', 'certainty', 'Bruno', 'Sonia.I', 'rate', 'film', 'bit', 'shy', '5*', 'will', 'round', 'up', 'compensate', 'extremely', 'negative', 'reviews']",N/A

997955,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000G0O5IM,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 2]","A lot of those arthouse films are great upon their first viewing. Interesting stories with well-drawn characters and a leisurely pace that allows the film to breathe without feeling like it's a race to the finish. However, I noticed that they're hard to keep watching afterwards. It's not a case of a re-evaluation but rather it doesn't have that sustainability other films might have. So we have L'Enfant, a film that's quite provocative and interesting, but it's hard to think you'll watch this for years to come.Bruno and Sonia are 2 teenagers in love that are incredibly short on cash. Sonia comes home to find that Bruno actually rented the place for money to a couple, leaving them without a place. It also doesn't help that Sonia just recently gave birth to his son, Jimmy. Getting desperate for cash, Bruno does the unthinkable: he sells his child and puts them in an adoption. Obviously, Sonia doesn't take it well and he gets the child back but when the buyers need to be repaid even more money, Bruno has to figure out a way to make a lot of money in a very short amount of time, which of course is next to impossible for him.While I'm not faulting Jeremie Renier's performance, the Bruno character is rather uninteresting. He shows little regard for other people, including his own girlfriend and baby. He is either uncaring or just unaware that his girlfriend is seriously mad at him yet he keeps asking for her phone or favors. However, Deborah Francois manages to play Sonia like someone who'd probably be best with someone else, yet for all his faults, she loves the guy. Not to mention she's just super cute.One thing that of course makes the film work is that it feels real since a huge percentage of it is shot handheld with long takes. While the story at times stretches credibility and it doesn't help that Bruno appears more often than Sonia does, the way it was shot and the feeling of it helps to sell the film and make it more real. It's one of those kind of films that succeeds despite some faults you may find.How about the subtle message? Well, in this town I'm in, I can certainly say there's been a lot of women becoming mothers a bit too soon. While I'm not going after motherhood, I'd prefer it if they waited until they can financially and emotionally handle it, rather than adopting that too common ""whatever happens, happens"" attitude. Not to mention that some...SOME guys tend to tend to take off since that wasn't part of the plan (i.e: lots of sex). A woman said that Hostel was a good film for guys who think Europe is all about hot chicks and booze. Well the film was incredibly stupid but I could understand what she meant. L'Enfant is a good film to watch for couples who maybe should think about things before they decide to build a life.Is it watchable? I'd certainly say so, it did get a big response at Cannes but I don't know whether you should buy it. It's great but it probably isn't a ""fun"" film to watch over and over again.",5,A great film that you may or may not feel like buying,1156982400,"08 31, 2006",2006,2975,"['lot', 'films', 'are', 'great', 'first', 'viewing', 'Interesting', 'stories', 'well-drawn', 'characters', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'film', 'breathe', 'feeling', 'race', 'finish', 'However', 'noticed', ""'re"", 'hard', 'keep', 'watching', 'afterwards', 'not', 'case', 're-evaluation', 'rather', ""n't"", 'have', 'sustainability', 'other', 'films', 'might', 'have', 'have', ""L'Enfant"", 'film', 'quite', 'provocative', 'interesting', 'hard', 'think', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'years', 'come.Bruno', 'Sonia', 'are', '2', 'teenagers', 'love', 'are', 'incredibly', 'short', 'cash', 'Sonia', 'home', 'find', 'Bruno', 'actually', 'rented', 'place', 'money', 'couple', 'leaving', 'place', 'also', ""n't"", 'help', 'Sonia', 'just', 'recently', 'gave', 'birth', 'son', 'Jimmy', 'Getting', 'desperate', 'cash', 'Bruno', 'unthinkable', 'child', 'adoption', 'Obviously', 'Sonia', ""n't"", 'take', 'well', 'child', 'back', 'when', 'buyers', 'need', 'be', 'repaid', 'even', 'more', 'money', 'Bruno', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'make', 'lot', 'money', 'very', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'course', 'next', 'impossible', 'him.While', ""'m"", 'not', 'faulting', 'Jeremie', 'Renier', 'performance', 'Bruno', 'character', 'rather', 'uninteresting', 'little', 'regard', 'other', 'people', 'including', 'own', 'girlfriend', 'baby', 'uncaring', 'just', 'unaware', 'girlfriend', 'seriously', 'mad', 'yet', 'asking', 'phone', 'favors', 'However', 'Deborah', 'Francois', 'play', 'Sonia', 'someone', 'who', ""'d"", 'probably', 'be', 'best', 'someone', 'else', 'yet', 'faults', 'guy', 'Not', 'mention', 'just', 'super', 'cute.One', 'thing', 'course', 'film', 'work', 'real', 'huge', 'percentage', 'shot', 'handheld', 'long', 'story', 'times', 'stretches', 'credibility', ""n't"", 'help', 'Bruno', 'more', 'often', 'Sonia', 'way', 'was', 'shot', 'feeling', 'sell', 'film', 'make', 'more', 'real', 'one', 'kind', 'films', 'faults', 'may', 'find.How', 'subtle', 'message', 'Well', 'town', ""'m"", 'can', 'certainly', 'say', 'been', 'lot', 'women', 'becoming', 'mothers', 'bit', 'too', 'soon', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'motherhood', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'waited', 'can', 'financially', 'emotionally', 'handle', 'rather', 'adopting', 'too', 'common', 'attitude', 'Not', 'mention', 'SOME', 'guys', 'tend', 'tend', 'take', 'off', 'was', ""n't"", 'part', 'plan', 'i.e', 'lots', 'sex', 'woman', 'said', 'Hostel', 'was', 'good', 'film', 'guys', 'who', 'think', 'Europe', 'hot', 'chicks', 'booze', 'Well', 'film', 'was', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'could', 'understand', 'what', 'meant', ""L'Enfant"", 'good', 'film', 'watch', 'couples', 'who', 'maybe', 'should', 'think', 'things', 'decide', 'build', 'life.Is', 'watchable', ""'d"", 'certainly', 'say', 'so', 'did', 'get', 'big', 'response', 'Cannes', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'should', 'buy', 'great', 'probably', ""n't"", 'fun', 'film', 'watch', 'over', 'again']",N/A

997957,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000G0O5IM,Grady Harp,"[7, 7]","The writing and directing team of Jean-Pierre Dardenne and Luc Dardenne once again have created a film that is harsh, difficult to watch, and tremendously honest and recalcitrant to opt out for happy endings.  These two artists manage to address strange issues, play them as realistic as feasible and them allow the audience reaction to complete the tale.Bruno (J&eacute;r&eacute;mie Renier) and Sonia (D&eacute;borah Franois) are two teenage drifters who have just given birth to a baby nine days ago.  They live off Sonia's welfare and Bruno's petty theft crime gang of young kids, namely Steve (J&eacute;r&eacute;mie Segard) who steal for Bruno, Bruno sells the hot items, then pays the boys.  Bruno is not a responsible boy, preferring not to get a job, but wanting to buy expensive clothes to look good.  His response to Sonia is one of playful adoration (they are obviously very much in love) but he appears to have little attachment to their new son Jimmy. In an act of desperation Bruno sells Jimmy on the Black Market for considerable money. When he tells Sonia she is devastated and throws mim out.  Bruno makes contact with the source to whom he sold Jimmy, gains the baby back, only to discover that other thugs are now involved and demand 5000 Euros from him because of their loss in the scam. Bruno convinces Steve to commit some thefts with him on motorbike and they are followed with disastrous effects for Steve. Bruno faces his atrocious behaviors and the manner in which he accepts responsibility and the consequences attached provide a very heartrending ending to this story.The film is shot with an eye for realistic location and mood. It is almost impossible for the audience to accept the behavior of these teenagers and that seems to be one o the goals of the writers and directors.  Life has a spectrum of events - happy, silly, absurd, disastrous, monstrous, tender, forgiving - and these are all incorporated into the form of an unlikely story that becomes so real it is painful to watch. The young actors are superb, completely credible, and very real in their portrayal of the various personality aspects of their characters.  The film is played without a musical score (except for a moment of Johann Strauss on a car radio) and the cinematography by Alain Marcoen is intensely aligned with the story.

He continues to steal, and trade on the black market. But, when one idea to sell off his newborn son on the black market backfires, he must suffer the conquences of his actions.The film was a tragic tale of how we still have the child in us. The filmmakers clearly were showing that the couple of Bruno and Sonia were still children taking care of themselves, but then the baby is added to the mix. The filmmakers showcase the way that Bruno and Sonia are stil children. Bruno hangs out with school children, and he laughs at when one of his friends passes gas, and He does childlike things, when he rubs the stick into the pond. It shows that Bruno was not that fit to be a parent yet. That he was a self centered person and didn't care for his child. But, there were instances where I thought that He did indeed care for his child, when he broke the news that he sold off the baby to Sonia, she reacted strongly and he went on a misson to get the baby back because he understood that he had made a grave error in selling off his son. Also, towards the end of the film, he shows maturity and steps closer to becoming a adult when he realizes what he had done was wrong and I feel after that, he was willing to change himself for his girlfriend and his son.The film was tragic. It had barely any happiness, but towards the end. We see how the couple is after the baby is sold and it totally tears apart their relationship. Bruno doesn't realize his actions are stupid and childish, but he gains more experience as he goes along in the film somehow in his later actions.

I've been disappointed with films that have won this prestigious award (Elephant, I liked it...But not as good as it should've been), but then again my favorite movie of all time won (Pulp Fiction). L'enfant is not a flawless film, I don't think I've seen any of the other movies that won the award so I can't honestly say that this isn't the best film from Cannes. It's a good film, with some honest performances and an original storyline. But...Well, I'll get to that in a minute. The movie is about a young couple named Bruno (Jeremie Renier) and Sonia (Deborah Francois), who have just had a baby named Jimmy. Bruno is a petty thief, who will do and sell anything for money. He's not a bad guy, he's just a stupid one. Bruno then discovers a way to make a lot of money. Sell Jimmy, which he does. Needless to say, Sonia is disappointed and calls the cops. Driven by both the police involvement and his love for Sonia, Bruno gets the baby back...But he's still left with the dilemna that he owes the people who took the baby twice as much as he sold it to them for. The movie's title, when translated into english, is The Child. Now I could be wrong, but I don't think this title is referring only to little Jimmy. I think it also represents his parents. In the beginning of the film, we watch Bruno and Sonia walking around and acting like children. Spraying soda (or was it beer?) onto each other, joking around. While Sonia is smarter than Bruno, both are pretty stupid. Since Bruno is so stupid, you don't really hate him for the stupid things he does. But there were times for me when I grew bored with him. I think his decision at the end redeems himself for all the stupid stuff he did in the rest of the film, so in the end...The movie has a pretty good message, but yeah...It's still not perfect. The movie does have some excitement, however, like when Bruno and a young boy steal a woman's purse and ride away on a scooter. Don't get me wrong, it's a good film and the performances are good.

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[4, 4]","Arriving with an impressive pedigree and having won some significant international film prizes (including the top honor at Cannes), it's easy to approach ""L'enfant"" with lofty expectations.  But those anticipating something grandiose will likely be surprised by this sparse and unexpected tale.  Far from epic, ""L'enfant"" tells a personal story about making mistakes, accepting responsibility, and embracing adulthood.  With a film entitled ""The Child,"" I had expected this story to be about a young couple coming to grips with parenthood.  Instead, the child in question serves more as a catalyst for action than an actual character.  As such, the film is free to explore the more interesting topic of personal redemption--how someone can take small steps to alter a life course that seems inevitable.""L'enfant"" opens with Sonia, newborn infant in hand, tracking down the baby's father, Bruno.  Bruno is something of a street tough, sleeping in shelters when necessary, stealing as a career--he seems, at first, to be relatively apathetic about being a new father.  However, his genuine fondness for Sonia soon becomes apparent and the three start to band together as a dysfunctional family unit.  Spending money as quickly as he can dishonestly make it, their living situation is far from ideal.  One day, almost on a whim, Bruno makes a decision that shocks Sonia and drives the couple apart.  Not realizing the severity of his actions or its repercussions, he sets about making it right.  But doing the correct thing, in this instance, only pulls him further into the criminal life.The film benefits from an impressive performance by J&eacute;r&eacute;mie Renier as Bruno.  Even as his actions must be viewed as reprehensible, he still comes off as likable enough.  I believe this stems from a realness in his performance that allows one to identify him as a misguided youth who makes idiotic decisions as opposed to a character with real malice.  His gentler scenes with Sonia, Deborah Francois, possess a palpable tenderness and a youthful playfulness.  Seeing these softer moments, it makes Bruno's evolution more realistic--he wants to be a better person, even if it's not something that he has consciously decided.  The film's ending is bittersweet, understated, open-ended and just about perfect.  It allows for possibility, but doesn't spell out any tangible future.There were some logistical questions that plagued me--most noticeably, how does Sonia take care of that baby?  But a few minor quibbles aside, I found ""L'enfant"" to be quietly moving and completely satisfying.  As more and more children are having and raising children of their own, ""L'enfant"" stands as an interesting case study.  I very much enjoyed this tale.  It thwarted my expectations at every turn--this hard edge story possesses a sweetness and hope that doesn't seem likely, but seems believable all the same.

I wanted to see more of his work.  I will look for ""La Promesse"" and ""Criminal Lovers.""  ""L'Enfant"" is a hard film to watch because of the subject matter.  The DVD extra conversation with directors Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne was enlightening as they articulated how they are trying to show France's other half, where people are not well off, where no one will hire them and the will to survive by any means is strong.  Deborah Francois performed in her first film here and has gone on to do more work including one with the intriguing title ""Red Ants.""  As Sonia, she is a whirlwind of maternal emotion.  With the film starting as she comes home and finds that her boyfriend has sublet her apartment, we know Bruno will be an unusual character.  The film builds him up as Sonia searches for him.  Renier does a marvelous job.  His good looks and screen presence makes us not hate Bruno, despite his doing such terrible things.  We see Bruno and Sonia romp and play like children in love.  Jeremie Segard well plays the red-haired purse-snatching boy that is Bruno's accomplice.

997969,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B000G0O5IM,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[4, 4]","The Dardenne brothers' latest film is another remarkable and powerful experiment in realism, that never lets up or backs off or lets you ease away your attention from the two troubled Belgian teenagers who have just become parents.  What the film is really about, it seems to me, is the question of what that means.  Sonia thinks it means they will ""settle down"" and Bruno will get a job and stop being a ringleader for younger boys engaged in petty theft.  Bruno doesn't know what to think.  It's just another thing, big deal, that he doesn't want to affect him or his lifestyle.  He doesn't see himself as a father, and is genuinely surprised when Sonia makes a fuss about him having sold the boy on the black market for adoption.  He can't see what troubles her, and can't understand why she isn't appeased when she sees how much money they made or when he promises they can have another.  He discovers only indirectly, through the impact on her and the consequences for him of his choices, that the birth of his son combined with the so far untested feelings he has for Sonia has changed him and changed who he can be.The moment of discovery is analogous to similar scenes in Dostoevsky's novel Crime and Punishment or in Bresson's film Pickpocket, and is genuinely touching and powerful.  The actor playing Sonia is perfect, and depicts her naive and playful innocence as well as her sincere indignation with a flawless performance.  The actor  playing Bruno, who carries more of the weight of the film, is almost as perfect.  He is charismatic (simultaneously repulsive because of his indifference and yet likeable because of his carefree innocence -- he is living the way he has always lived and cannot understand that he is wrong to do so) and has a presence on camera that justifies the attention the camera gives him -- there are moments, though, in which he is making a discovery or developing an insight or making a decision, and his expressions are a bit too cliched and unsubtle to be believable, approaching for a moment the extreme expressiveness of silent film.  Still, as I mentioned, the burden of the film is on him and he carries it well.  The style of the Dardenne Bros., perfected and made extreme in this film, can be almost described as a ""relentless close-up"": for most of the film they follow the faces of the main characters and adapt fluidly to their every movement (another reviewer described this approach as ""shaky cam"" and I think that is innacurate, the camera moves fluidly and is probably being carried with a steadycam, but does not ""shake"" -- what may look like shaking is the rhythm of keeping up with the movements of the actors; the ""shaky cam"" is the result of handheld camera work, sometimes because that is the only option but sometimes done in order to simulate the kind of realism to be found in war footage; that is not what appears in this film).  Stylistically, the film reminded me of Lodge Kerrigan's film ""Keane"", and while Damien Lewis in Keane is a more controlled actor than Jeremie Renier (who plays Bruno), Jeremie is able to alternate fluidly between intensity and a warmth and playfulness.

Sonia has just given birth to a son, and 9 days later, in a flash of madness and desparation, Bruno decides (thinking Sonia would be okay with it) to give up the baby for adoption, but not in the kind of adoption we would think of, he in fact sells the baby (for 5,000 Euros as we would later learn). When he informs Sonia, she goes beserk and realizing his mistake, Bruno goes on a mission to get the baby back. He in fact manages to do so, but if you think that is the end of the movie, you are mistaken. Yet more troubles ensue, and you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out. I am not giving any further details away but I promise that the closing scene of the movie will likely leave you in tears (as it happened to be again).The movie created a huge buzz upon its initial showing at the 2005 Cannes movie festival and in fact it won the ""Palme d'Or"", and for good reason.

Bruno is a liar and a thief, a man so thoroughly bereft of any recognizable moral code that he is willing to sell his own newborn son for some quick cash without the knowledge of the child's mother.  Bruno is so detached from reality that he actually believes his girlfriend will be cool with what he has done once she finds out.  When she turns him into the authorities, Bruno realizes he has perhaps gone too far this time and tries to make amends for his actions.""L'Enfant"" is an interesting examination of a man whom it is easy to dislike but difficult to dismiss.  Co-writers and directors Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne clearly see him as representative of a certain type of amoral youth that has come to dominate modern society.  Lazy, immature, utterly self-absorbed, with no ability to sustain deep, meaningful relationships with others and no interest in becoming a functioning member of the society in which they find themselves, these young people act almost entirely on impulse, indifferent to the law, the norms of society and the feelings of others.  Yet, Bruno does not seem entirely lost by the end of the film.  There are glimmers, however slight, of a possible change of behavior, of a willingness to come in out of the cold and perhaps make something of his life.""L'Enfant"" could have been a great film had the Dardennes been a little less content to merely observe Bruno and his actions and a little more willing to probe them.  We get the sense sometimes that, interesting as he is to watch, he would be even more interesting to know, if only we could get beneath the surface and find out what it is that really makes the man tick.  Perhaps there's no explanation for why people like Bruno are like they are, and that may be the moviemakers' ultimate point, but one wishes that the screenplay would dig into his psyche a bit more and help enlighten us about the character.This is no denigration of Jeremie Renier, who manages to convey a great deal about Bruno through facial expressions and body language even when the screenplay is keeping relatively mum about him.

The young central character, Bruno - the real ""child"" of the title - is a study in the kind of street-smart survival skills that rely on an absence of emotion or conscience, which makes him interesting to watch, but entirely unsympathetic. The filmmakers want us to care about him and see him perhaps as a victim of social circumstances, but these are fairly undefined in the film, except for an enabling mother who appears briefly to provide him with an alibi for the police. Actually, he could come from anywhere in the social spectrum, as likely to be the product of wealth and privilege. Maybe his only saving grace is that his crimes are nonviolent, though he lays waste to anything of potential value in his life.The bleakness of the moral vacuum at the center of the film is reflected in the chilly, gray urban setting, where many scenes are played out against the constant, noisy flow of traffic on the streets.

The story's arc seems drawn from one of Dostoevsky's novels, with the main character, Bruno, selling his infant son to finance his greed for various consumer goods, then being confused by his girlfriend's subsequent rejection of him and finding himself slipping into a psychological abyss, only to find a kind of redemption at the end.  Few films present characters, especially one this flawed, so honestly and yet with such compassion.  The writing, direction and acting all combine to make the events of the film entirely believable.  The whole film is engrossing and culminates in an amazing chase scene that manages to be as emotionally engaging as it is viscerally exciting.  The final shot, though so simple, is very moving.

After watching it, though, I can't help but think the reviewers were swayed by the earlier movies.The plot is as follows: Sonia comes back from the hospital with her new baby, Jimmy.  She finds her apartment has been sublet by Bruno, her boyfriend.  When she finally finds him she asks why he didn't visit in the hospital, and after some excuses, she forgives him.  Bruno is a petty thief who has no interest and working and spends every dollar he steals.  Eventually, he sees a chance to make some money and so he sells the baby when he learns there's money to be made in black market adoptions.  Sonia is not happy when she finds out, and Bruno spends the rest of the movie trying to make things right.From an artistic standpoint, the movie looks good and it's filmed with a lot of skill.  The directors don't use music or any other gimmick to make you feel something for the characters.  They never try to explain Bruno's mindset, they just let you observe things as they happen.The problem is that it's impossible to understand Bruno.  Most of us can't identify with that character at all.  We all know lazy or bad people, but how many of us know someone who would sell away his own child and not understand why that might offend the mother?  Bruno seems like an irredeemable character, and since he's on screen in almost every shot, it's hard to find a single person to identify with in the film.

Nemeth,"[4, 4]","""L'Enfant,"" a small-scale but winning film from the Dardenne brothers, charts the moral growth of its unpromising protagonist, Bruno, a petty thief living by his wits in the wasteland of a Belgian rust-belt city. The arrival of his first child, Jimmy, rouses Bruno's  girlfriend, Sonia, into something like womanhood, but Bruno remains fixed as a boy-man.A thin vein of welcome irony plays throughout this part of Bruno's story, appearing particularly in his utter cluelessness as to what human beings do not buy and sell. At the outset whatever moral and emotional self he has is subordinated to the getting of cash. Not only does he quickly sublet his girlfriend's apartment while she's in the maternity hospital, but he sells his new baby, almost immediately, for ready money.His surprising growth in personhood begins with his shock upon discovering Sonia's hysteria at the loss of their son. Most of the film then traces his efforts to get the baby back and the subsequent complications and misfortunes these lead to. As his fortunes decline, wonderfully enough he grows in moral stature. First of all, he comes to realize how much he loves and needs Sonia. His moral peak reaches its height when he goes late in the film to a police station, implicating himself in a botched robbery for which a youthful accomplice has been solely charged. Forgoing his earlier adolescent habit of improvisational lying and entering instead the adult world of guilt and sorrow through his acceptance of responsibility, Bruno, while at his lowest ebb, has in fact become a grownup.",4,"""A Good Man Is Hard To Find""",1167609600,"01 1, 2007",2007,1569,"[""L'Enfant"", 'small-scale', 'winning', 'film', 'Dardenne', 'brothers', 'moral', 'growth', 'unpromising', 'protagonist', 'Bruno', 'petty', 'thief', 'living', 'wits', 'wasteland', 'Belgian', 'rust-belt', 'city', 'arrival', 'first', 'child', 'Jimmy', 'Bruno', 'girlfriend', 'Sonia', 'something', 'womanhood', 'Bruno', 'fixed', 'boy-man.A', 'thin', 'vein', 'welcome', 'irony', 'plays', 'part', 'Bruno', 'story', 'appearing', 'particularly', 'utter', 'cluelessness', 'what', 'human', 'beings', 'do', 'not', 'buy', 'sell', 'outset', 'moral', 'emotional', 'self', 'subordinated', 'getting', 'cash', 'Not', 'only', 'quickly', 'sublet', 'girlfriend', 'apartment', 'maternity', 'hospital', 'new', 'baby', 'almost', 'immediately', 'ready', 'money.His', 'surprising', 'growth', 'personhood', 'begins', 'shock', 'discovering', 'Sonia', 'hysteria', 'loss', 'son', 'Most', 'film', 'then', 'efforts', 'get', 'baby', 'back', 'subsequent', 'complications', 'misfortunes', 'lead', 'fortunes', 'decline', 'wonderfully', 'enough', 'moral', 'stature', 'First', 'all', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'Sonia', 'moral', 'peak', 'height', 'when', 'late', 'film', 'police', 'station', 'implicating', 'botched', 'robbery', 'youthful', 'accomplice', 'been', 'solely', 'charged', 'Forgoing', 'earlier', 'adolescent', 'habit', 'improvisational', 'lying', 'entering', 'instead', 'adult', 'world', 'guilt', 'sorrow', 'acceptance', 'responsibility', 'Bruno', 'lowest', 'ebb', 'fact', 'become', 'grownup']",N/A
997979,A2AJMMNO4S3IK,B000G0O5IM,"Tintin ""tintin75""","[21, 21]","At the 2005 Cannes Festival, brothers Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne received the Palme d'Or for l'Enfant, their second in six years (the first for Rosetta, in 1999).The film opens with eighteen-year-old Sonia (Deborah Fran'ois), freshly released from the maternity hospital and carrying her brand-new baby, knocking at the door of her own apartment. She is refused admission. Taking advantage of her brief hospitalization, her boyfriend, Bruno (Jeremie Renier), rented the apartment for the week to some strangers. This incident sets the tone for the rest of the film. Sonia returns to the street where she encounters a friend with a motor scooter who takes her and the infant to meet twenty-one-year-old Bruno, who is the baby's father. Bruno casually looks at his son, ""Jimmy,"" but he doesn't pay too much attention to him, as he is in the process of making one of his ""deals."" Bruno lives at the fringe of society, surviving off petty theft, trafficking in stolen properties with a gang of young teens who look up to him, and cadging Euros from Sonia's Government-issued family allowance. His latest ""deal"" having apparently succeeded, he goes and buys a beautiful baby stroller.Later, while Sonia stands in line at the welfare office, Bruno takes the baby for a stroll in the carriage. While walking, he decides to sell Jimmy to a baby adoption trafficker, and then swiftly carries out his misbegotten plan. When he reconnects with Sonia and shows her the money, she reacts violently, and demands Jimmy's return. Bruno says simply, ""We'll make another one."" Sonia is overcome by shock, and faints. Bruno carries her to the hospital, and then worried that her raving about ""the baby"" is going to get him in trouble, embarks on a course to retrieve his son. Bruno arranges for the return of the trafficker's money, recovers Jimmy, and takes him back to Sonia at the hospital. However, the trafficker, accompanied by his goonish bodyguard, demands an ""indemnity"" from Bruno equal to double the payment for the botched transaction. To make sure that Bruno understands the seriousness of this indemnity, the trafficker's bodyguard beats Bruno, and in the process takes the few Euros that Bruno had in his pockets, which the trafficker says will be deducted from the total sum Bruno owes him. The indemnity is so large, Bruno knows that he will never be able to repay. Nevertheless, he valiantly tries, with the help of Steve (Jeremie Segard), a member of Bruno's gang, and one thing leading to another, he eventually ends up in jail.L'Enfant was filmed in the town of Seraing, a dreary industrial suburb of Liege, located on the Meuse River. The film's style is that of a documentary, using a hand-held camera which is always on the move, pursuing Bruno and Sonia. So many close ups and extreme close ups force the viewer into extreme intimacy with the characters, and produce a somewhat claustrophobic atmosphere from which no escape is possible. The film's austerity is amplified by the fact that there is no music in the whole film, only urban background noises.As always, the Dardennes rely on the ability of their actors to be the actual characters before playing their parts. The never provide psychological descriptions of their protagonists, but leave it to the viewers to discover them as they develop on the screen. Jeremie Renier is the lead, as Bruno. Renier was discovered by the Dardenne brothers as a teenager, when they featured him in the leading role of La Promesse (1996). In L'Enfant, Renier is spontaneous and natural, simply superb in his role of the amoral Bruno. Deborah Fran'ois, in her debut role as Sonia, is already a compelling actress. Twenty-three babies were used in the role of Jimmy, not due to the part's challenge, but because of the necessity for multiple retakes -- babies require feeding and changing, and they can get cranky fast. A doll was used as a stand-in during only one scene at the beginning of the film, where Jimmy is carried by Sonia on the back of a motor scooter, because of the potential danger that may have been posed to a real infant. The doll's name was ""Jimmy Crash.""Bruno, although physically adult, behaves like a child. He is not immoral as much as he is amoral, like a young animal, living day-to-day, oblivious to tomorrow. When he has money, he spends it on the spur of the moment: he buys a pricey baby carriage, expensive clothes, or he leases a fancy convertible to take his girlfriend and infant son on a joyride. Bruno seems to understand money in its purest form, as currency: the longer it stays in one place, the less valuable it is.On the other hand, Bruno is generous, and above all, honest. When he distributes the proceeds of his ""deals"" to his young gang members, he is scrupulously honest in letting them know the precise amount of each transaction. And he does not abandon Steve in the hands of the police, but voluntarily goes to the police station, surrenders the stolen cash and takes full responsibility for the holdup. Sonia does not appear to have a strong personality, until she is challenged by the loss of her baby. Right in the beginning, after Bruno sells Jimmy to the trafficker, we see how motherhood transforms Sonia. For Bruno, it will take longer -- actually until the end of the film, following a series of terrible events. Even then, he will not have an epiphany, but at least something in him will change.""L'enfant"" (the child) is almost faceless, just a lumpy blue bundle with two tiny, protruding hands. He does have a name, ""Jimmy,"" but he does not know it yet, as nobody speaks to him or addresses him during his first few days as a human being. Jimmy's start in life does not show much promise. He will have the distinction of having driven back from the hospital on a motor scooter, without a helmet, on a drizzling day. He will carry forever the feeling of abandonment, and a hatred for flowered wallpaper, remembering the room where his father sold him for a wad of Euros. Will he ever get beyond his inauspicious beginnings? The film's cathartic ending hints at this possibility. The Dardennes may be resigned regarding Bruno's and Sonia's future, or lack thereof, but one feels that they carry their hope for a new beginning in Jimmy.Bruno and Sonia live in a permanent ""here and now."" They are like two cubs, cavorting, rough-housing, laughing, full of life and full of love for each other. In spite of their immaturity, there is no question that Bruno and Sonia love each other, and in the end, their love overcomes their adversity, bringing a faint glimmer of hope: for the first time in the film, and in their life. They transcend the gloomy present in their reconciliation, which could also be a manifestation of their survival instincts.Bruno and Sonia live in a society which ignores and destroys its children, turning them into fringe elements, petty thieves, and misfits, a society where crime leads to more crime, more crime to violence, and so on, ending finally with imprisonment. Is there a solution? The Dardennes seem to answer ""yes,"" and propose love and nurturing as the solution.The Dardenne brothers never fall into the melodramatic or whining sentimentalism. Their reality, sordid though it is, speaks for itself. They are neither judges nor moralizers. They show us a crumbling society which has lost its bearings, and whose moral code has collapsed under the weight of repeated social and economic crises. Bruno and Sonia evolve in their everyday devoid of both perspective and future.To conclude, a small production anecdote. In filming the scene when Bruno and Steve are on the run and find themselves up to their necks in the Meuse River, Jeremie Renier got into trouble. The cold water (which was 42 degrees Fahrenheit) was polluted by industrial oil from a nearby coal processing plant, and Renier twice ingested some of it. This landed him in the local hospital for a stomach pumping that evening.The strength of Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne's film is to have made Bruno and Sonia, both such society outsiders, simply as two human beings, not the dregs of society nor poor wretches to be pitied: a remarkable achievement worth four stars.",4,We'll make another one,1151625600,"06 30, 2006",2006,8173,"['2005', 'Cannes',

997980,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000G0O5IM,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 3]","You may not like the films by Dardenne Brothers, Belgian director duo who previously did `Rosetta' and `The Son.' Some say their approach to the material is too somber and detached, refusing to let us relate to the main characters. True. And their new film `L'Enfant' (`The Child') is no different. (In the first place the film has no soundtrack music.) But the film contains at its heart a strong drama, a story told in a gripping manner without manipulating the audiences. Yes, the film is stark and grim, but that doesn't mean it does not offer any chance of hope.The film follows the life of two young Belgians, Bruno and his girlfriend Sonia. Bruno (who may be an adult or still a teenager) has no work, and worse, despises those who work. The two even have no particular place to live, but Bruno doesn't care. If he needs money, Bruno, being a petty criminal, just steals things and converts them into hard cash.And now Bruno, hearing about one underground agency, thinks of using their infant son. He does it so casually, like selling an old car, without letting Sonia know his decision about child trafficking.One remarkable thing about the film is - and you have to see this part for yourself -- that Bruno has no sense of guilt in doing everything he does. Not that he is evil, as you will see it in the film, but unlike Sonia, who is naturally shocked to hear his atrocious behaviors, Bruno just cannot see the meaning of what he is doing. And as the film goes on, it poses many intriguing questions -- Can he remedy his error? Or more precisely, can he realize his error? With quiet and strong storytelling, the directors convince us of the two characters of Bruno and Sonia, and their life that goes nowhere.You don't see a big heist or a sugary melodrama. The film is set in a drab, non-descript city in Belgium, where nothing looks attractive.
