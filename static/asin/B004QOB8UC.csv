Where readers delight in the chestnuts carried over from previous books, they fall hard on video. It doesn't mean that they serve no purpose; the measured pace of dialogue requires shortcuts. So Jesse says: ""Because I like you"" to disguise his real reason for interviewing Gino Fish. You must guess why. He watches a clip of an old Jimmie Stewart movie, 'Mr Smith Goes to Washington', about corruption.Jesse is Retired, but he looks for clues to the murder of a young college woman. Irritating the powers in Paradise, he pursues a predator. His casual attitude toward personal safety allows him to take risks that civil servants cannot. The music, a staple of each film, sets a slow pace for the unfolding plot. This is an excellent counterpoint to the testerone-fueled action movies available otherwise. I like the retribution Jesse hands out.As always, the rocky inlets and coast form a backdrop for the production.",4,"A new chief, a new page",1372464000,"06 29, 2013",2013,990,"['detective', 'genre', 'hard', 'translate', 'written', 'page', 'TV', 'screen', 'Where', 'readers', 'delight', 'chestnuts', 'carried', 'previous', 'books', 'fall', 'hard', 'video', ""n't"", 'mean', 'serve', 'purpose', 'measured', 'pace', 'dialogue', 'shortcuts', 'So', 'Jesse', 'like', 'disguise', 'real', 'reason', 'interviewing', 'Gino', 'Fish', 'must', 'guess', 'why', 'clip', 'old', 'Jimmie', 'Stewart', 'movie', 'Smith', 'Goes', 'Washington', 'corruption.Jesse', 'Retired', 'clues', 'murder', 'young', 'college', 'woman', 'Irritating', 'powers', 'Paradise', 'predator', 'casual', 'attitude', 'personal', 'safety', 'take', 'risks', 'civil', 'servants', 'can', 'not', 'music', 'staple', 'film', 'slow', 'pace', 'unfolding', 'plot', 'excellent', 'counterpoint', 'testerone-fueled', 'action', 'movies', 'available', 'otherwise', 'retribution', 'Jesse', 'out.As', 'always', 'rocky', 'inlets', 'coast', 'form', 'backdrop', 'production']",Jesse Stone: Innocents Lost

The style of this series and the quality of the acting by the ensemble cast and great walk-in's is so understated and direct that it smacks of this same reality.

Tom Selleck and the entire support casts (which vary) of each of the movies do an excellent job of keeping the stories interesting and moving along.

The soundtrack to this series is excellent and really enhances the mood and the cinematography is stunning.

1425761,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B004QOB8UC,D. S. Thurlow,"[18, 20]","""Innocents Lost"" is the seventh installment in the Jesse Stone television movies starring Tom Selleck, set in the fictional town of Paradise, Massachusetts.  The movies are based on novels by Robert B. Parker.As this movie opens, Jesse Stone has been forcibly retired as police chief of Paradise and is in search of some inner peace.  He experiments with jogging; talks with his psychiatrist (a returnng William Devane); has an affair with a young woman who works at a car dealership; and commiserates with the members of the Paradise police department (Kathy Baker and Kohl Sudduth), who are suffering under the reign of a new, young and politically ambitious police chief.The only thing that really seems to engage Jesse is the chance to do some police work.  He is asked to consult for the state on a homicide case that seems open and shut, but isn't.  Jesse uses his connections with the State Police to work a separate, private case.  This one involves the death of a young woman whom Jesse had attempted to assist in the past.  The clues lead Jesse to a private drug rehab facility for the wealthy, a doctor with political connections, and a Russian mobster with ruthless working habits.Even by the deliberately paced standards of Jesse Stone movies, this is a meandering story.  Jesse Stone gets a lot of quiet time with his aging dog while wrestling with his drinking problem.  Each of the returning characters gets some screen time with Stone, and the moments of shocking violence we have come to expect are saved for the end.

Stone is bothered when he learns that a girl he tried to help apparently commited suicide. Everyone tells him to leave the case alone. He is no longer the police chief.

That Tom Selleck was playing the part I became more suspect, given that the Jesse Stone in the novels is about 35-40.  But the TV series has turned out to be excellent drama, that is, until this one. Maybe it's because R. Parker didn't have a part in the plot, but this 'episode' feels like a 'paint by number story, with a beginning and end that are so weak, clips from two movie classics are bookended into the structure. You should understand their significance after the plot runs its course. The story and subplot just don't make it in this one, and the only character that continues to be of interest is William DaVane playing a tough-love chain smoking psychiatrist. If you haven't seen any of this series, I urge you not to make this the first choice. It may dissuade you from watching the others, and most of the episodes are unique to TV cop drama--there's a lot of substance without the flash, and many emulate the very clever banter of Robert Parker, the novelist.

You don't have to blow things up, just use character interactions with other characters or things to illustrate their history, current view of their purpose in life/mission, and perhaps lead the viewer to anticipate alternative futures coming up, toying with them by using those threads as you develop the story.

1425808,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004QOB8UC,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[287, 298]","Following 2010's ""No Remorse,"" Tom Selleck returns (and shares a writing credit) for the latest installment of the Jesse Stone saga in ""Innocents Lost.""  In this, the seventh outing, Selleck is more world weary and introspective than usual.  I don't know that there has ever been a serialized crime drama that is so reliant on quiet moments and character contemplation.  And, in truth, it is this moody thoughtfulness that has really made this series of movies strikingly unique in the modern television landscape.  Lacking hysterics and over-the-top action set pieces, the Jesse Stone series is a quietly compelling throw-back to when stories and people mattered more than special effects. And, as always, the icing on the cake is the pitch perfect Tom Selleck who paints Jesse as both lovable and excruciatingly frustrating.  I, personally, think that Stone is Selleck's best role--it is no wonder that he has revived him seven times.""Innocents Lost"" really breaks no new ground, just tells another chapter.  Stone, now retired, is still trying to find an inner equanimity and peace.  Seeing an unorthodox therapist, consorting with a younger woman, staying grounded with his old colleagues--Jesse's existence is a quiet one.  When a young girl whom Jesse feels responsible for ends up dead in an apparent overdose, he feels deep guilt and sets out to determine what went awry.  He is also asked to consult on a murder case in the city where the police feel that their suspect is innocent.  Retirement doesn't seem so uneventful after all!  The story leads to some unexpected places--as the girl's life spiraled out of control, several key factors and nefarious influences led her astray.  But how far is Jesse willing to take his off-the-books investigation, and to what purpose?Those who have followed the series will see plenty of familiar and expected faces.  Most noteworthy, we see his former co-workers (Kathy Baker and Kohl Sudduth) adjusting to the new Paradise Police Chief.  But despite some nice moments, this remains very much Selleck's show!  Jesse Stone must surely be one of the most laid back heroes to ever grace the small screen and Selleck has perfected the minimalism necessary to make this character stand out. In the film world of quick cut editing, these films defy expectation by unfolding at a very leisurely pace.  ""Innocents Lost"" fits comfortably into its place in the Stone lexicon.  This one is less about mystery and intrigue and more about spending time with Selleck and Stone--a pairing that has become virtually iconic.

1425819,A1GQAKL9CGQLP1,B004QOB8UC,L. M. Keefer,"[1, 1]","Compared to the other episodes in this series, this one seemed a bit quirkier.  And they're all quirky to be sure, which is part of their charm.The extreme quirkiness related to pacing and plot.  It was like the writers and producers--Selleck and Brandman--were having fun toying with the structure of the show.  Jesse was more moody and introspective than usual--and who can blame him as he was recently fired from being Police Chief.  This show accurately mirrors the times and perhaps they wanted to do that for viewers.  To say, you're not alone. Even the dog looked more depressed than usual. Many are going through tough times now and we get it.However, the anchoring crime--the overdose of the young friend of Jesse's--it didn't seem like a mystery to be solved so much.  Again, maybe more like real life.  Then there was the investigation of the young man in Boston who the head of homicides doubted his guilt.  Jesse figured that one out by thinking about it mainly which was fascinating and impressive--but not much investigation. Seems like that was an interesting case and could have been amped up more. There wasn't a lot of suspense in this show.  And maybe that's okay.  It seemed Jesse's personal life dominated. I like 1/4 personal life and 3/4 investigation/mystery--especially as Jesse's personal life is so darn depressing!I DO like the new girlfriend.  That was a bright spot in the show. Hope they keep her around.  Hasty Healy, the shrink, and Gino Fine are ALWAYS a delight as secondary characters.  The new police chief has the ability to annoy and amuse so he should be a fun character to watch.The cinematography was exceptional in this: the rain splashing against the camera lens in the opening scene, coffee being poured, cutting away during an action and coming back and finding other characters were now there.  That was very effective and creative.I did like the artistic sense of this episode and the experimentation, but the plot lines maybe could have been intensified a tad, although the conclusion was very satisfying.",4,An Off-Beat Entry in the Jesse Stone Saga,1339632000,"06 14, 2012",2012,2055,"['Compared', 'other', 'episodes', 'series', 'one', 'seemed', 'bit', 'quirkier', ""'re"", 'quirky', 'be', 'sure', 'part', 'charm.The', 'extreme', 'quirkiness', 'related', 'pacing', 'plot', 'was', 'writers', 'producers', 'Selleck', 'Brandman', 'were', 'having', 'fun', 'toying', 'structure', 'show', 'Jesse', 'was', 'more', 'moody', 'introspective', 'usual', 'who', 'can', 'blame', 'was', 'recently', 'fired', 'being', 'Police', 'Chief', 'show', 'accurately', 'times', 'perhaps', 'wanted', 'do', 'viewers', 'say', ""'re"", 'not', 'alone', 'Even', 'dog', 'looked', 'more', 'depressed', 'usual', 'Many', 'are', 'going', 'tough', 'times', 'now', 'get', 'it.However', 'anchoring', 'crime', 'overdose', 'young', 'friend', 'Jesse', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'mystery', 'be', 'solved', 'so', 'much', 'Again', 'maybe', 'more', 'real', 'life', 'Then', 'was', 'investigation', 'young', 'man', 'Boston', 'who', 'head', 'homicides', 'doubted', 'guilt', 'Jesse', 'figured', 'one', 'out', 'thinking', 'mainly', 'was', 'fascinating', 'impressive', 'not', 'much', 'investigation', 'was', 'interesting', 'case', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'amped', 'up', 'more', 'was', ""n't"", 'lot', 'suspense', 'show', 'maybe', 'okay', 'seemed', 'Jesse', 'personal', 'life', 'dominated', 'like', '1/4', 'personal', 'life', '3/4', 'investigation/mystery', 'especially', 'Jesse', 'personal', 'life', 'so', 'darn', 'depressing', 'DO', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'was', 'bright', 'spot', 'show', 'Hope', 'keep', 'around', 'Hasty', 'Healy', 'shrink', 'Gino', 'Fine', 'are', 'ALWAYS', 'delight', 'secondary', 'characters', 'new', 'police', 'chief', 'ability', 'annoy', 'amuse', 'so', 'should', 'be', 'fun', 'character', 'watch.The', 'cinematography', 'was', 'exceptional', 'rain', 'splashing', 'camera', 'opening', 'scene', 'coffee', 'being', 'poured', 'cutting', 'away', 'action', 'coming', 'back', 'finding', 'other', 'characters', 'were', 'now', 'there', 'was', 'very', 'effective', 'creative.I', 'did', 'artistic', 'sense', 'episode', 'experimentation', 'plot', 'lines', 'maybe', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'intensified', 'tad', 'conclusion', 'was', 'very', 'satisfying']",Jesse Stone: Innocents Lost

1425832,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004QOB8UC,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","Author Robert Parker is perhaps best known for the series of books he wrote about his private detective Spenser, mostly due to the popularity of the TV series which starred the late Robert Urich. But he began a series of books based on a second character named Jesse Stone and those stories have been turned into TV films starring Tom Selleck in the lead role. The latest has just arrived on DVD.As the film opens Jesse is dealing with a form of depression, falling back into old habits of drinking (the character has a history of alcoholism) after being placed into forced retirement by the town council of Paradise, the town he lives in. The head of that group has plans for Jesse's position, namely inserting his son in law as the head of the police department.Jesse ends up having more to worry about when a young woman named Cindy Van Alden (Eileen Boylan) turns up dead, an apparent suicide. This was a young girl that Jesse had helped in the past, getting her into rehab and trying to save her life. The new police chief is more concerned with the tourist trade in town and the damage the death of a local tied to drugs could do. So Jesse takes it upon himself to look deeper into the girl's death.Without a badge how can he do so? Jesse was recently asked by his friend Healy of the State Police to assist in a different investigation. This side story takes up little of Jesse's time and permits him to carry a badge while looking into Cindy's past.It turns up that Cindy's rehab experience wasn't quite what Jesse thought it would be. As he talks to the doctor that heads the facility he learns that the man is a resident of Paradise and that for all the talk of trying to save people's lives the facility is actually a rehab mill, a place that offers a quick fix to addicts and then turns them lose with little or no follow up.As Jesse puts together the pieces of the puzzle elements of the Russian mob, an assist from a former foe named Gino (William Sadler) and taking on the responsibility he felt he ignored that resulted in the young girl's death all come to play. The guilt of her death weighs heavy on his shoulders and inspires him to find justice for another life lost.This film is quite different than most mysteries seen today. Rather than count on heavy duty gunfire and fast paced car chases, the film focuses on character development and dialogue that rolls smoothly rather than at a whip snake pace. Conversations seem like conversations and words by all characters are chosen wisely so as to not trip themselves up, the result being placed in jail.Selleck does a great job as Jesse Stone, a man with a troubled past and who is currently troubled with the present. He intends on taking back his job, the only one he's truly ever known and excelled at. The town council may be more interested in the appearance of the town on the surface but Jesse is concerned with justice and the safety of the people who live there. At the same time his inner demons have started him drinking again and the depression he deals with has caused him to seek help in a psychiatrist/ex-cop played by William Devane.The pacing of the film seems incredibly slow but on reflection you realize that it's just the story unfolding in the most natural way possible. Plot devices aren't tossed in randomly and the interaction between characters makes this a much better film than one would expect.Parker only finished 9 novels with this character before his death.  This story was written by the man continuing the tales of Jesse Stone, Michael Brandman, and Selleck himself. They've done a great job and one can only hope to see more.",3,SLOW PACED MYSTERY,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,3632,"['Author', 'Robert', 'Parker', 'perhaps', 'best', 'known', 'series', 'books', 'wrote', 'private', 'detective', 'Spenser', 'mostly', 'due', 'popularity', 'TV', 'series', 'starred', 'late', 'Robert', 'Urich', 'began', 'series', 'books', 'based', 'second', 'character', 'named', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'stories', 'have', 'been', 'turned', 'TV', 'films', 'starring', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'lead', 'role', 'latest', 'just', 'arrived', 'DVD.As', 'film', 'Jesse', 'dealing', 'form', 'depression', 'falling', 'back', 'old', 'habits', 'drinking', 'character', 'history', 'alcoholism', 'being', 'placed', 'forced', 'retirement', 'town', 'council', 'Paradise', 'town', 'head', 'group', 'plans', 'Jesse', 'position', 'namely', 'inserting', 'son', 'law', 'head', 'police', 'department.Jesse', 'up', 'having', 'more', 'worry', 'about', 'when', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Cindy', 'Van', 'Alden', 'Eileen', 'Boylan', 'up', 'dead', 'apparent', 'suicide', 'was', 'young', 'girl', 'Jesse', 'had', 'helped', 'past', 'getting', 'rehab', 'trying', 'save', 'life', 'new', 'police', 'chief', 'more', 'concerned', 'tourist', 'trade', 'town', 'damage', 'death', 'local', 'tied', 'drugs', 'could', 'do', 'So', 'Jesse', 'look', 'deeper', 'girl', 'death.Without', 'badge', 'how', 'can', 'do', 'so', 'Jesse', 'was', 'recently', 'asked', 'friend', 'Healy', 'State', 'Police', 'assist', 'different', 'investigation', 'side', 'story', 'up', 'little', 'Jesse', 'time', 'carry', 'badge', 'looking', 'Cindy', 'past.It', 'up', 'Cindy', 'rehab', 'experience', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'what', 'Jesse', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'doctor', 'facility', 'man', 'resident', 'Paradise', 'talk', 'trying', 'save', 'people', 'facility', 'actually', 'rehab', 'mill', 'place', 'quick', 'fix', 'addicts', 'then', 'lose', 'little', 'follow', 'up.As', 'Jesse', 'together', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'elements', 'Russian', 'mob', 'assist', 'former', 'foe', 'named', 'Gino', 'William', 'Sadler', 'taking', 'responsibility', 'felt', 'ignored', 'resulted', 'young', 'girl', 'death', 'come', 'play', 'guilt', 'death', 'heavy', 'shoulders', 'find', 'justice', 'life', 'lost.This', 'film', 'quite', 'different', 'most', 'mysteries', 'seen', 'today', 'Rather', 'count', 'heavy', 'duty', 'gunfire', 'fast', 'paced', 'car', 'chases', 'film', 'character', 'development', 'dialogue', 'smoothly', 'rather', 'whip', 'snake', 'pace', 'Conversations', 'seem', 'conversations', 'words', 'characters', 'are', 'chosen', 'wisely', 'so', 'not', 'trip', 'up', 'result', 'being', 'placed', 'jail.Selleck', 'great', 'job', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'man', 'troubled', 'past', 'who', 'currently', 'troubled', 'present', 'taking', 'back', 'job', 'only', 'one', 'truly', 'ever', 'known', 'excelled', 'town', 'council', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'interested', 'appearance', 'town', 'surface', 'Jesse', 'concerned', 'justice', 'safety', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'there', 'same', 'time', 'inner', 'demons', 'have', 'started', 'drinking', 'again', 'depression', 'caused', 'seek', 'help', 'psychiatrist/ex-cop', 'played', 'William', 'Devane.The', 'pacing', 'film', 'incredibly', 'slow', 'reflection', 'realize', 'just', 'story', 'unfolding', 'most', 'natural', 'way', 'possible', 'Plot', 'devices', 'are', ""n't"", 'tossed', 'randomly', 'interaction', 'characters', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'one', 'would', 'expect.Parker', 'only', 'finished', '9', 'novels', 'character', 'death', 'story', 'was', 'written', 'man', 'continuing', 'tales', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'Michael', 'Brandman', 'Selleck', ""'ve"", 'done', 'great', 'job', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'see', 'more']",Jesse Stone: Innocents Lost

Hathaway is thinking of putting himself up again for city council as a reformed criminal who has learned his lesson from his past jail time.

1425901,A3KXV8AFQ550DY,B004QOB8UC,Wayne C. Rogers,"[1, 1]","When it comes to television, I only have a few favorite shows that I enjoy watching on a regular basis.  Right now it's Justified, Dexter, The Big C with Laura Linney and Oliver Platt, and the ""Jesse Stone"" series, starring Tom Selleck.  The Big C and the ""Jesse Stone"" series, however, are the only two shows that yank at my heart strings and make me feel something other than the adrenaline rush associated with violent action and horror scares.For me the ""Jesse Stone"" television series (CBS only televises about one show a year)  is about people with weaknesses, struggling to do the right thing and sometimes failing in their quest.  It's about deep loss and the things people do to cope with it.  The stories also deal with love, especially the love a man has for his ex-wife and being unable to let go, whether it's addiction, co-dependence, or obsession.  Let's not forget about the theme of action and reaction, and dealing with the consequences.  The stories concern themselves with addiction, the things that cause us to become addicted, and the gradual, but very hard road to recovery.  It's about how good people do bad things and how sometimes bad people do good things when you least expect it.  It's about friendship and how we treat our friends on a day-to-day basis.  In many ways, it's also a show about life and death, and how we live our lives during the brief time we're given.Whenever a new ""Jesse Stone"" movie comes on TV, it like revisiting with old friends you haven't seen in a few years.  There's a comforting feeling about it.  I think that's why so many viewers enjoy this series with Tom Selleck in it.  For me, it was no different with Innocents Lost.  It was just like picking up where No Remorse ended, except that Robert Harmon wasn't directing this time out.  Dick Lowry took over the reins of that position.Spoiler Alert!  So don't read any further if you have a problem with that.  Anyway, this time around a new police chief has taken over Jesse's job in Paradise.  His name is William Butler, and he's the son-in-law of councilman, Carter Hanson, the guy who wanted Jesse fired from his job.  Jesse, however, was forcibly retired, which means that he at least has an income to live off of, though it may not be much. The reason I say ""not much"" is because when he visits Dr. Dix for this therapy sessions, he has to start running a tab for a while because he can't afford to pay $180 an hour for a shrink.  The two cases Jesse gets involved with in this movie have to do with the death of a young friend, Cindy Van Aldan, whom he'd lost contact with; yet, she dies from a drug overdose on her way to see him.  The second case is through Captain Healy in Boston.  A man arrested for the murder of a convenience store owner is about to be sentenced, and Healy thinks he's actually innocent of the crime.  Healy wants Jesse Stone to find proof of the accused person's innocence before the sentencing takes place.  Jesse will take on the job, but only if the state police captain gives him a badge to use.  Jesse, of course, then uses the badge to delve into the death of his friend, which later gets him into trouble with Healy.  Still, thanks to the help of Sister Mary John and Gino Fish, Jesse is able to track down the killer of his friend and then sets everything up so the killer will come after him.  The case for Healy also falls together, though not quite in the way they expected.  By the end of the show, Suitcase has quit the force, and who knows what Rose will do down the road.  Right now, she needs the job.Anyway, it was fun seeing Kathy Baker back again as Rose Gamon, one of the officers on Jesse's old police force, along with Kohl Sudduth as police officer Luther ""Suitcase"" Simpson.  William Devane as Dr. Dix always delivers a quirky, yet powerful performance.  Saul Rubinek is back as Hasty Hathaway, and he still thinks Jesse had an affair with his ex-wife, though he is still quite fond of Jesse.  And, let's not forget Stephen McHattie as Captain Healy.  He's the kind of friend every man needs when times get tough.  Then there's the lovely Kerri Smith as Sister Mary John, and you wonder if she and Jesse will ever get together for more than dinner and a discussion about girls and drug addiction.  William Sadler as Gino Fish is almost a likable guy now that he's put Jesse on the list of people he'll see at any time and helps the ex-cop to find the killer of Cindy.  It also helps that Gino has a new personal assistant manning the front office now that Allen is dead--the provocative and beautiful and ultra sexy Amanda, played by Christine Tizzard.  For me, she's much more pleasant to look at than Allen was though she shares the dead Allen's attitude.  To put it bluntly, Amanda's snooty.I have to admit that this particular show had an extremely large amount of beautiful actresses in it, and it makes me wonder if Tom Selleck had anything to do with the casting.  There's Gloria Rueben, who plays Hasty's secretary and Jesse's love interest.  Rae Ritke plays Cindy's mother, and I have to say she could easily give the women of Desperate Housewives  a run for their money.  Stacey Smith plays the college administrator that Jesse visits to find out more about Cindy, and she's a looker, too.Here's one thing, however, that needs to be fixed in the series.  The Jesse Stone character has had his dog, Reggie, since the first episode.  It's about time he started playing with him.  Gosh, the sad expressions on Reggie's face breaks my heart each time I see it.  Playing with a dog takes more than patting the cushion next to you to see if the animal dog will come over.  Most dogs need attention and to be played with on a daily basis by their owners.  After all, dogs have feelings, too.  If Jessie doesn't start treating Reggie right, I'm going to call the Dog Whisperer.While I'm ranting, here's another thing that's starting to disturb me.  Jesse has to get a handle on the booze.  He needs to stop drinking for the most part and get his job back so Suitcase and Rose don't end up leaving town.  If they go, Paradise will be up the creek without a paddle.  Jesse also needs to get another telephone for the house so his friends can reach him and not die in the process.  In other words, Jesse needs to shape up and get his act together.  Everybody has problems, and the majority of people find a way of dealing with them so they can function in day-to-day society.One last rant and then I'm done for the day.  The DVD of Innocents Lost doesn't have any extras on it.  Shame on the people who put the DVD together.  Why not some interviews with the cast and producers and writers?  Why not a look at the series versus the novels and why the series decided to branch off from the books?  Why not a ""Making Of"" featurette?  I think Stone Cold was the only one of the movies to have any extras at all.  If these DVDs are going to cost an arm and a leg when they come out, at least give the viewers something more than the movie to watch.That's it.  Another ""Jesse Stone"" movie is due out in 2012.",4,"Jessie needs to play with his dog, Reggie!!!",1315094400,"09 4, 2011",2011,7068,"['When', 'television', 'only', 'have', 'few', 'favorite',
