343761,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,6302880777,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[7, 7]","Winning a 1979 Emmy award for ""Outstanding Animated Program"" (executive producer David D. Connell and producer Steven Cuitlahuac Melendez) and being nominated for a second  in Outstanding Individual Achievement - Animation Program"" (writers Bill Melendez and Connell), this animated version of the C.S. Lewis book holds a special place in my heart - it was the adaptation that introduced me to Narnia.Directed by Bill Melendez (the man who gave us the Charlie Brown and Peanuts movies) this cartoon is beautiful in its simplicity. Of course to am eight-year old the  Christian imagery was not apparent, but what I do remember through the clouds of nostalgia is being entranced by the magic and the adventure.  Made for television it was one of those movies tha tbecame a perennial favorite for British television during the movie-heavy Christmas period and was one that I eagerly awaited (this was after all the days before the mass ownership of VCR's.) So, it was with a mixture of excitement and nervous anticipation that I picked up my copy - and I was not disappointed.Of course for big-screen spectacle  nothing can really match the 2005 Disney blockbuster of the same name (which has become Disney's most successful live-action movie ever with grosses over $740 million and has a second movie PRINCE CASPIAN prepping for a summer 2008 release,) but for simple storytelling and involving characters this animated movie is successful in what it sets out to do.Featuring clever narration by the leads, dead-on expression by the characters and lines taken from the Lewis book this movie succeeds in making a faithful, good  adaptation  in 95 minutes.This version also features two of the most recognizable voices from British television of this era in Leslie Phillips as Mr. Timnus and Leo McKern as the professor, amongst a cast of largely unknowns.The animation can appear inconsistent at times but the drawing style is both unique and enchanting.  This is a far better work than the BBC production, which featured terrible production design and acting and perhaps the most fake-looking Aslan possible.The story is well-known but for those who are unfamiliar with the novel or the adaptations the story revolves around four children who are sent to live with a professor. There they find a passage to a mysterious land known as Narnia through the back of a giant wardrobe. Narnia is a world in a state of perpetual winter due to the rule of the evil White Witch. But, the childrens arrival has been foretold and a determined group of magical creatures, led by the noble lion Aslan believe they are the ones predicted to deliver Narnia from the witch's iron grip.This is a ""kid-safe"" production that parents need not worry about showing to their children, the action scenes are done just right and the dark moments are not taken too seriously, and yet there is enough intellect in the exposition to satisfy adults.The music by Michael J. Lewis is also a highlight which is full of light and fits the scenes perfectly.There are two versions of this movie available on DVD. In an unusual move the cheaper of the two is actually better. Whereas the more expensive version clocking in at just under $25 has only some trailers, the cheaper one (for about $14 or less) has information on Lewis and the Narnia books).  Certainly the cover and menu's may be better on the more expensive one, but other than that the cheaper version is the easier one to recommend.",5,Emmy-winning adaptation of a childhood favorite,1147996800,"05 19, 2006",2006,3458,"['Winning', '1979', 'Emmy', 'award', 'Outstanding', 'Animated', 'Program', 'executive', 'producer', 'David', 'D.', 'Connell', 'producer', 'Steven', 'Cuitlahuac', 'Melendez', 'being', 'nominated', 'second', 'Outstanding', 'Individual', 'Achievement', 'Animation', 'Program', 'writers', 'Bill', 'Melendez', 'Connell', 'animated', 'version', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'book', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'was', 'adaptation', 'introduced', 'Narnia.Directed', 'Bill', 'Melendez', 'man', 'who', 'gave', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Peanuts', 'movies', 'cartoon', 'beautiful', 'simplicity', 'course', 'am', 'eight-year', 'old', 'Christian', 'imagery', 'was', 'not', 'apparent', 'what', 'do', 'remember', 'clouds', 'nostalgia', 'being', 'entranced', 'magic', 'adventure', 'Made', 'television', 'was', 'one', 'movies', 'tha', 'tbecame', 'perennial', 'favorite', 'British', 'television', 'movie-heavy', 'Christmas', 'period', 'was', 'one', 'eagerly', 'awaited', 'was', 'days', 'mass', 'ownership', 'VCR', 'So', 'was', 'mixture', 'excitement', 'nervous', 'anticipation', 'picked', 'up', 'copy', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed.Of', 'course', 'big-screen', 'spectacle', 'nothing', 'can', 'really', 'match', '2005', 'Disney', 'blockbuster', 'same', 'name', 'become', 'Disney', 'most', 'successful', 'live-action', 'movie', 'ever', 'grosses', '740', 'million', 'second', 'movie', 'PRINCE', 'CASPIAN', 'prepping', 'summer', '2008', 'release', 'simple', 'storytelling', 'involving', 'characters', 'animated', 'movie', 'successful', 'what', 'out', 'do.Featuring', 'clever', 'narration', 'leads', 'dead-on', 'expression', 'characters', 'lines', 'taken', 'Lewis', 'book', 'movie', 'making', 'faithful', 'good', 'adaptation', '95', 'minutes.This', 'version', 'also', 'two', 'most', 'recognizable', 'voices', 'British', 'television', 'era', 'Leslie', 'Phillips', 'Mr.', 'Timnus', 'Leo', 'McKern', 'professor', 'cast', 'largely', 'unknowns.The', 'animation', 'can', 'appear', 'inconsistent', 'times', 'drawing', 'style', 'unique', 'enchanting', 'far', 'better', 'work', 'BBC', 'production', 'featured', 'terrible', 'production', 'design', 'acting', 'perhaps', 'most', 'fake-looking', 'Aslan', 'possible.The', 'story', 'well-known', 'who', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'novel', 'adaptations', 'story', 'four', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'sent', 'live', 'professor', 'find', 'passage', 'mysterious', 'land', 'known', 'Narnia', 'back', 'giant', 'wardrobe', 'Narnia', 'world', 'state', 'perpetual', 'winter', 'due', 'rule', 'evil', 'White', 'Witch', 'childrens', 'arrival', 'been', 'foretold', 'determined', 'group', 'magical', 'creatures', 'led', 'noble', 'lion', 'Aslan', 'believe', 'are', 'ones', 'predicted', 'deliver', 'Narnia', 'witch', 'iron', 'grip.This', 'kid-safe', 'production', 'parents', 'need', 'not', 'worry', 'showing', 'children', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'done', 'just', 'right', 'dark', 'moments', 'are', 'not', 'taken', 'too', 'seriously', 'yet', 'enough', 'intellect', 'exposition', 'satisfy', 'adults.The', 'music', 'Michael', 'J.', 'Lewis', 'also', 'highlight', 'full', 'light', 'scenes', 'are', 'two', 'versions', 'movie', 'available', 'DVD', 'unusual', 'move', 'cheaper', 'two', 'actually', 'better', 'more', 'expensive', 'version', 'clocking', 'just', '25', 'only', 'trailers', 'cheaper', 'one', 'about', '14', 'less', 'information', 'Lewis', 'Narnia', 'books', 'Certainly', 'cover', 'menu', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'more', 'expensive', 'one', 'other', 'cheaper', 'version', 'easier', 'one', 'recommend']",N/A

HOWEVER, the warfare and extremely realistic monsters in that version are too scary for my little kids.I had seen this movie on TV from time to time in the 80s, and I got the DVD based on those memories.  It is faithful to the original book (which I have read out loud to my kids), but the witch is really screechy.  One of the best things about the book, and about the 2005 movie, is that the witch is attractive/evil.  This version's witch has no allure -- which does make it a bit harder to reinforce to my kids that evil is seductive.Time enough for that.One thing I REALLY like about this version is that Edmund is so easy to understand -- his jealousy and mean-spiritedness are easy for little kids to pick up on.  The other three children are not well-developed characters at all -- this is mostly Edmund's story.  Appropriate for talking about each of our own needs for redemption.This is a decent version of the story, laden with obvious commercial breaks, and you can certainly tell it is old-school animation.

343768,A23X8TCMAS7TLL,6302880777,Noel Hadley,"[9, 11]","Like many of you out there, I am a dedicated CS Lewis fan, and so when I chanced to see this DVD release, I couldn't hold myself back. I had seen this film throughout childhood, and so seeing it on my shelf now brings warm memories to my heart. It is a true shame that the good people that brought us this wonderful piece of delight never afforded the effort to deliver us others, such as Prince Caspian, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, and The Silver Chair, etc.Much like the BBC versions, which covered only the titles mentioned above, this particular version remained wholly loyal to the book, implementing the dialogue and scenes as they were. There is only a slight alteration, however, in which Lucy recounts, through memory, her journey through the Wardrobe. While I am not a pure loyalist to original works when it comes to transfers from book to movie, as I liked the changes done in the 2005 Narnia movie (just not the stuff that they left out), I find this particular change of pace to be rather annoying.I was disappointed with this specific DVD edition. It appears as though there was no effort to clean up the original film before making the digital transfer. Dirt blotches can be seen spewed about the screen from the first opening shot until the closing. For some buyers, this sort of quality won't matter much, while, to others, it will no doubt irritate beyond belief. I like to consider myself somewhere in the middle of the two, and so, while the irritation is present in the opening act, it typically fades as the movie progresses, and so there is only little harm done.Unfortunitely, my disapointment doesn't end there. If you happen to shop for this DVD in a store, you will undoubtedly notice that the back of the box advertises special features. The bio on CS Lewis had my attention, as well as facts on this particular movie/story. The special features were, however, several, if not less, power point presentations that had probably been put together by an intern at lunch break, no joke.Parents, it is quite possible that your children loved the 2005 Narnia movie so much that they can't wait until it is released on DVD, and possibly have even seen it on the shelves of a local Wal Mart store (or wherever else it is sold, I found it there), and so begged to have it. While I can't speak for the specific taste of your child, I often wonder if many children today can connect with this version at all. The artwork is, well, very vintage 1970's (1979 precisely), and nowhere near the quality of modern children's entertainment. This particular movie reminds me of the Hobbit and Return of the King cartoons from the 70's, and should fit nicely on the shelf next to them.However much I loved this film as a child, it is because of the mistakes mentioned above that I cannot give the movie a 5 star rating, as much as I'd like to, but feel as though I must lower it to a 3. If you feel as though you can hurdle over these obstacles, by all means, watch it; you will certainly be enriched for having done so.For those of you looking for an excellent Narnia companion to the movie, Focus on the Family published a wonderful Radio Drama series on the entire Chronicles, hosted by Douglas Grisham. This series is a pure delight, and your child (or you and your spouse), will certainly find enchantment in these imaginative episodes.",3,"Great book, excellent author, loyal movie, not so great DVD",1134950400,"12 19, 2005",2005,3354,"['many', 'there', 'am', 'dedicated', 'CS', 'Lewis', 'fan', 'so', 'when', 'chanced', 'see', 'DVD', 'release', 'could', ""n't"", 'hold', 'back', 'had', 'seen', 'film', 'childhood', 'so', 'seeing', 'shelf', 'now', 'warm', 'memories', 'heart', 'true', 'shame', 'good', 'people', 'brought', 'wonderful', 'piece', 'delight', 'never', 'afforded', 'effort', 'deliver', 'others', 'such', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'Voyage', 'Dawn', 'Treader', 'Silver', 'Chair', 'etc.Much', 'BBC', 'versions', 'covered', 'only', 'titles', 'mentioned', 'above', 'particular', 'version', 'remained', 'wholly', 'loyal', 'book', 'implementing', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'were', 'only', 'slight', 'alteration', 'however', 'Lucy', 'recounts', 'memory', 'journey', 'Wardrobe', 'am', 'not', 'pure', 'loyalist', 'original', 'works', 'when', 'transfers', 'book', 'movie', 'liked', 'changes', 'done', '2005', 'Narnia', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'stuff', 'left', 'out', 'find', 'particular', 'change', 'pace', 'be', 'rather', 'annoying.I', 'was', 'disappointed', 'specific', 'DVD', 'edition', 'was', 'effort', 'clean', 'up', 'original', 'film', 'making', 'digital', 'transfer', 'Dirt', 'blotches', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'spewed', 'screen', 'first', 'opening', 'shot', 'closing', 'buyers', 'sort', 'quality', 'wo', ""n't"", 'matter', 'much', 'others', 'will', 'no', 'doubt', 'irritate', 'belief', 'like', 'consider', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'two', 'so', 'irritation', 'present', 'opening', 'act', 'typically', 'movie', 'so', 'only', 'little', 'harm', 'done.Unfortunitely', 'disapointment', ""n't"", 'end', 'there', 'happen', 'shop', 'DVD', 'store', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'notice', 'back', 'box', 'special', 'features', 'bio', 'CS', 'Lewis', 'had', 'attention', 'as', 'well', 'facts', 'particular', 'movie/story', 'special', 'features', 'were', 'however', 'several', 'not', 'less', 'power', 'point', 'presentations', 'had', 'probably', 'been', 'put', 'together', 'intern', 'lunch', 'break', 'joke.Parents', 'quite', 'possible', 'children', 'loved', '2005', 'Narnia', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'released', 'DVD', 'possibly', 'have', 'even', 'seen', 'shelves', 'local', 'Wal', 'Mart', 'store', 'wherever', 'else', 'sold', 'found', 'so', 'begged', 'have', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'specific', 'taste', 'child', 'often', 'wonder', 'many', 'children', 'today', 'can', 'connect', 'version', 'artwork', 'well', 'very', 'vintage', '1970', '1979', 'precisely', 'nowhere', 'quality', 'modern', 'children', 'entertainment', 'particular', 'movie', 'Hobbit', 'Return', 'King', 'cartoons', '70', 'should', 'fit', 'nicely', 'shelf', 'next', 'them.However', 'much', 'loved', 'film', 'child', 'mistakes', 'mentioned', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'movie', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'as', 'much', ""'d"", 'like', 'feel', 'must', 'lower', '3', 'feel', 'can', 'hurdle', 'obstacles', 'means', 'watch', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'enriched', 'having', 'done', 'so.For', 'looking', 'excellent', 'Narnia', 'companion', 'movie', 'Focus', 'Family', 'published', 'wonderful', 'Radio', 'Drama', 'series', 'entire', 'Chronicles', 'hosted', 'Douglas', 'Grisham', 'series', 'pure', 'delight', 'child', 'spouse', 'will', 'certainly', 'find', 'enchantment', 'imaginative', 'episodes']",N/A

Animation had its limits and Disney wasn't going to sink the money into it.  The animation is not only completely faithful to the story, but truly captures the spirit of the story where the BBC version can't.  BBC's Aslan is cheesy; this Aslan is perfectly real.  In my humble opinion, the animation is perfect.  I don't think we could do the story any better justice today, with all our special fx.I was a preschooler in 1979 when this came out.  I still remember watching it and being utterly captivated with the evil of the White Witch and the beauty and power of Aslan.  The story spoke to me so strongly that I can still see the entire thing in my head almost 25 years later, having only seen it once more since.
