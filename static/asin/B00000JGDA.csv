Some strong scenes, and some good acting, but some of the dialog was - I can only call it - ""artificially sharp."" (But that might be the way the characters were supposed to be, according to the writer.) We were sort of looking forward to seeing the film just end, to be honest. I recorded it from TV, and have now erased it.",2,"Well acted, but unsatisfying, I'd say.",1111104000,"03 18, 2005",2005,450,"['were', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'saw', 'film', 'agreed', 'well-acted', 'word', 'came', 'mind', 'was', 'unsatisfying', 'strong', 'scenes', 'good', 'acting', 'dialog', 'was', 'can', 'only', 'call', 'artificially', 'sharp', 'might', 'be', 'way', 'characters', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'according', 'writer', 'were', 'sort', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'film', 'just', 'end', 'be', 'honest', 'recorded', 'TV', 'have', 'now', 'erased']",I'm Losing You
506034,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00000JGDA,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","Bruce Wagner's screen adaptation of his novel I'M LOSING YOU has some of the more intelligent dialogue to be encountered in a film.  Since Wagner also directed this little gem, brimming over with excellent actors, we can be assured that his message of death as a necessary component in the cycle of life is intact.  Despite the dour content of the story this film actually leads to a credible sense of how deaths can ultimately be redemptive: it is all in how vulnerable we allow ourselves to become in coping with this life change.The story is focused on a wealthy Los Angeles family headed by television producer of sci-fi series Perry Krohn (Frank Langella), married to a psychiatrist Diantha (Salome Jens) despite having a 'helper' mistress Mona (Amanda Donahue), 'stepfather' of a disillusioned daughter Rachel (Rosanna Arquette) and a has-been actor son Bertie  (Andrew McCarthy) who makes a living selling back insurance policies to AIDS patients: the father has been diagnosed with inoperable cancer and his attempts to set his will in order is the catalyst for the story.  The son is separated from his ex-wife, a disturbed addicted woman Lidia (Gina Gershon) and the two fight over custody of their young child Tiffany (Aria Noelle Curzon).  Complicating matters is the fact that Rachel has never been told until now that her biologic father murdered her mother and committed suicide AND that her stepfather had a onetime sexual fling with her mother.Things begin to consistently fall apart: the son falls in love with one of the AIDS victims, Aubrey (Elizabeth Perkins),  to whom he sells insurance who has a son and lives in horror that she will soon die and her son will be abandoned. About this same time Tiffany is killed in an automobile accident, the fault of her drugged out mother, and Rachel embraces her Jewish heritage by learning how to perform the body cleansing ritual performed as a loving act on the dead - the dead being Tiffany.  And at this peak of crises, Aubrey dies in a hospital, succumbing to every complication known to AIDS.How this fractured family comes together in the midst of all these losses and lifetime barriers to communication serves as the resolution of this complex but infinitely interesting story.The actors all give bravura performances, relishing the smart dialogue and the multilayered meanings to each encounter captured by the fine cinematographer.  This may not be a film for everyone, but for those seeking more form a film than entertainment will find much food for thought here. Recommended.

Don't bother with this if that's a reason you may want to view this movie as he appears for one very short scene as an angry, immature lover. It's otherwise a good story about a man diagnosed with Cancer, and his ""semi-dysfunctional"" family. Even though each character type was interesting, as was their way of dealing with Cancer in the family - this movie either needed just a little more time or less characters. There are some amusing scenes, some emotional (but not tear-jerking) elements; another reason not to bother with this movie is if you want to get a feeling of how it is to deal with Cancer in the family.

There was a lot going on, including Frank Langella's character Perry dying of lung cancer and Bertie's lover of AIDS, as well as a child being killed unexpectedly, along with a complicated family dynamic that got even more complicated in the end.  Andrew McCarthy was wonderful as Bertie, as was Rosanna Arquette as Rachel, Elizabeth Perkins as Aubrey, and just about everybody else.

506038,A2XJWS787GHPQD,B00000JGDA,MISS KITTY,"[0, 0]",This movie states unrated.  It should be rated R to warn viewers or potential buyers of the strong language and sexual content.  The story seemed to have too many sub plots for my taste.  The actors did a fine job with what they had.  Some of the scenes could have been done more tastefully and still made the point they intended.  The overuse of the one particular word made it less attractive.  My mother told me many years ago when I asked why people cursed so much that they did so because they lacked a good command of the english language and knew no other way to express themselves. Some people might not agree with me but the use of crude language in movies and music these days takes away from the story or song.Try something. Put a DVD in right now that has R rated language in it and play a small part with thesewords in the dialogue.  Stop. Think of words that would show the same intent and replay it replacing those words.  Do you still get the same information intended by the author as you did with the rougherlanguage?  Just a thought.  Good actors.  Bad choice for these talented people.,2,miss kitty,1351296000,"10 27, 2012",2012,1105,"['movie', 'unrated', 'should', 'be', 'rated', 'R', 'warn', 'viewers', 'potential', 'buyers', 'strong', 'language', 'sexual', 'content', 'story', 'seemed', 'have', 'too', 'many', 'sub', 'plots', 'taste', 'actors', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'what', 'had', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'more', 'tastefully', 'still', 'made', 'point', 'intended', 'overuse', 'one', 'particular', 'word', 'made', 'less', 'attractive', 'mother', 'told', 'many', 'years', 'when', 'asked', 'why', 'people', 'cursed', 'so', 'much', 'did', 'so', 'lacked', 'good', 'command', 'english', 'language', 'knew', 'other', 'way', 'express', 'people', 'might', 'not', 'agree', 'use', 'crude', 'language', 'movies', 'music', 'days', 'away', 'story', 'song.Try', 'something', 'Put', 'DVD', 'right', 'now', 'R', 'rated', 'language', 'play', 'small', 'part', 'thesewords', 'dialogue', 'Stop', 'Think', 'words', 'would', 'show', 'same', 'intent', 'replay', 'replacing', 'words', 'Do', 'still', 'get', 'same', 'information', 'intended', 'author', 'did', 'rougherlanguage', 'Just', 'thought', 'Good', 'actors', 'Bad', 'choice', 'talented', 'people']",I'm Losing You
