1385441,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B004529NKC,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 2]","The first in the `Step Up' series was a clever take on familiar themes that layered enough charisma and attention grabbing dance moves to make it wholly enjoyable and highly memorable.  The second film was a bit too copycat like, but it was still exciting in ways and offered up some fresh new dance sequences.  This `3D' disaster is just completely uncalled for.  Offering a plot that is equal parts copycat and equal parts preposterously absurd, `Step Up 3D' overdoes the films initial objective to death and creates an unapologetically lame entry into a series that was, for the most part, quite fun.  The dance sequences utilize the 3D technology rather well, but I hate films that make it so obvious they are TRYING to be 3D.  Honestly, I'm waiting for this current craze to die down, since I don't feel like wearing glasses every time I go to the movies, and when a film is made to be seen as 3D in the manner that `Step Up 3D' is, it is almost a requirement.  Watching it at home without the glasses actually makes the film annoyingly obvious.  With that said, I found that too many of the films choreography was ripped from the second film, as well with a lot of the staging of those scenes, and the overall plot was so empty headed that it made watching it a chore.  I don't mind light hearted romps, but I hate stupid movies.  This movie is just stupid.  Oh, and what a waste of dancing talent.  How in the world could they delegate truly admirable dancers (who graced the `So You Think You Can Dance' stage) to mere supporting roles with no real highlight of their talent?  I mean, you make `So You Think You Can Dance' champ Joshua dress like a robot and dance in a public restroom?  That whole scene (not to mention the correlating video camera scene taking place in the club) was just ridiculous.

This movie definitely fits its rating of pg13 because young children wouldn't find it interesting.Step Up Three is about a group of New York dancers, who team up with an NYU freshman to compete in a dance competition against some of the world's best dancers. They soon find out that dancing will change their lives. I really like the story line and the dancing was really cool.

All the songs had great beats and moved the plot along well.The actors, Sharni Vinson, Rick Malambri, Adam G. Sevani, Alyson Stoner, and Keith Stallworth do a really great job in showing their passion for dancing. When it comes to the visual effects you can't compare them to the visual effects in the first and second Step Up. The lighting on the stages is by far better.

Step Up 3 is the exception to that rule.  Yes, it is the third movie in a series but it really could stand alone.  The plot is intriguing, the passion between the main stars is too hot for words and the dancing is unbelievable!  I don't normally watch movies more than once, especially in only a few days time and I've already watched Step Up 3 four times!  That's a new record for me.  I watched the regular DVD first and then watched the Blu-ray version and there was a huge difference!  The picture quality is so much better on Blu-ray and the screen seemed to come to life.  I enjoyed this movie so much and it would make a great gift for the holidays!One of my favorite features on this DVD is the music videos.  I put them on while I'm cleaning the living room and it makes the chore so much more enjoyable.

1385449,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B004529NKC,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 9]","""Step Up"" taught us about the redemptive and freeing power of dance. It wasn't a particularly good or original lesson, nor was it a particularly good or original film, but at least what it had to say was clearly stated. ""Step Up 2: The Streets"" taught us the exact same thing, despite shifting the location from the studios and auditoriums of the Maryland School of the Arts to the streets of Baltimore, where, miraculously, street dancing was at the last minute accepted as a legitimate art form. Now we have ""Step Up 3-D,"" and while the location has changed yet again - from Baltimore to New York City - the message itself hasn't changed at all, and quite frankly, I'm sick of hearing it. I officially get the point; for some people, dancing is the only good thing they have going for them. Now that we've thoroughly established this, can we please find something else talk about?What annoys me to no end is that the film does more than recycle a message. It also recycles a plot formula and waters it down in the process. This is pretty strange given the fact that there wasn't much of a plot to begin with. The original ""Step Up"" was basically a low-rent retread of Alan Parker's ""Fame,"" focusing heavily on the choreography and the music but skimping on the maturity and the introspection. In other words, it lacked the sense that we were glimpsing into the lives of real people in real situations. ""Step Up 2"" went even further in its whittling away of the plot, reducing genuine drama to a contrived dance off between street crews. Now that we have come to ""Step Up 3-D,"" the plot has become so thin and inconsequential that every scene evaporates from our memories, even before they end.The only exceptions are the dance sequences, which are impressive to say the least. The choreographers, and there are many, stage a number of routines that push the actors to the limits of human endurance; they contort, kick, flip, jump, and spin so intricately, you'd almost swear their bodies were manipulated by computers. And then there's the film's big draw, its presentation in 3-D, which is - and it greatly pains me to say this - the best use of the process since ""Avatar."" The dancers really did seem to be reaching out of the screen. I actually felt immersed in the environment. The final dance showdown is especially great to look at; apart from the 3-D effects, the heroes were decked out in suits rigged with flashing LED lights and lasers. They looked liked extras from ""Tron.""The plot: Robert Alexander III, a.k.a. Moose (Adam Sevani), has moved to New York City to attend NYU with his best friend, Camile Gage (Alyson Stoner), who just happens to be the little sister to Tyler Gage, played in the first and second films by Channing Tatum. Moose wants to major in electrical engineering, but he finds he that misses dancing, and soon enough, he runs into Luke (Rick Malambri), a street dancer who does a little filmmaking on the side. Moose goes off and spends the rest of the film struggling to juggle his academic life with his social life. Luke, meanwhile, lives with a group of nomadic street dancers in a loft/studio once owned by his parents, themselves aspiring dancers before their untimely deaths. Their way of life is threatened by both finances and a rival dance team, who are just plain mean. Into Luke's life enters Natalie (Sharni Vinson), who has great moves and thinks it would be a good idea for Luke to pursue filmmaking.Would it surprise you to learn that everyone's future depends on winning a dance competition? If you can't see where the plot is going after ten minutes, especially if you've seen the first two films, then I suspect you would actually be surprised by the ending of a ""Titanic"" documentary or a biopic about Abraham Lincoln. This movie is contrived, clich&eacute;d, and ultimately unfulfilling, since the ending and everything leading up to it are hopelessly predictable. The thing is, I can say the exact same thing about all the films; the people behind them are so intent on repeating themselves that it transcends mere routine and becomes a form of monomania. I'm pointing a finger directly at Adam Shankman and Jennifer Gibot, the only two producers to have been involved in all three films. We get it, guys. Dancing is important to you.There is one particular scene in ""Step Up 3-D"" that actually held my attention all the way through. It featured Sevani and Stoner dancing up and down the streets of a New York City neighborhood while a remixed version of Fred Astaire's ""I Won't Dance"" blares from the speaker of an ice cream truck; it was all done in a single shot, and the two actors never missed a beat. It was a triumph of editing, choreography, and music. Why couldn't the rest of the film be like this? Maybe then, there would have been a good reason for it to have been made. The writers, directors, and producers of the ""Step Up"" series have told the exact same story three times in a row. How many more will it take for them to finally realize that they have exhausted an already hackneyed idea?",2,A New Dimension for a Tired Message,1281312000,"08 9, 2010",2010,5060,"['Step', 'Up',

1385450,AN9J46667D80O,B004529NKC,"Chris Swanson ""I'm just this guy, you know?""","[0, 1]","This movie is just about everything I don't like in a film. It's trite, it's stupid, it's got an insanely dumb plot, two-dimensional characters, and a checklist of cliches a mile long. It's a wonder it doesn't collapse in on its own pretension and turn into a black hole. And yet... I rather liked it. Oh, it's far from a great movie. But it has a certain amount of charm.The plot, such as it is, centers around two rival dance troupes. They have silly names and call themselves ""houses"". One is lead by the handsome and charismatic Luke while the other is lead by the handsome and charismatic Julian. We know Julian is Eeeeevil because he wears black and has a sinister look about him. They take their dancing so seriously I kept having flashbacks to the ""South Park"" episode ""You Got F'd in the A"".Into their world wanders a boy with the unfortunate nickname of Moose. Apparently he was in the other films, where I sincerely hope his nickname gets explained. He's played by Adam G Sevani, a very attractive, talented young dancer who gives the distinct impression of a gay person trying to play straight and falling short. He's cute and charming and very good at dancing.He gets recruited into Luke's little dance troupe and we soon find out that Luke's home/rehearsal space is about to be foreclosed on. Thankfully there's a dance competition coming up soon and the prize is $100,000. It's astonishing to me that could possibly be enough to cover a mortgage on a large space in New York City, but whatever.The plot goes from there with dancing, betrayal, dancing, romance, dancing and dancing, with only enough plot as needed to move the film forward. Really it reminded me of one of those porn films that pretends to have a plot when really all the audience wants is for the movie to do what it's meant to do. It's much the same here. I would have been far more interested in two hours of dancing footage and zero plot.Speaking of the dancing, oh, goodness. Yes, it's quite impressive. It is what makes the movie worth seeing, and it really is worth seeing just for that. People do things I didn't know where physically possible. It was frankly astonishing what some of these people can do with their bodies.But I do have an objection with much of the dancing. There's several scenes where we see dancing but it's so heavily edited it's very hard to tell exactly what's going on and to follow the action. That's a shame, because there's some real talent, but the camera doesn't take enough time to showcase it. This is less of a problem toward the end of the film, but it's a major issue at the start.Ignoring that and the really, really stupid plot, this is a fun little movie. If you can just put your brain into neutral and coast along, you'll be just fine.",4,Quite a lot more watchable than I'd expected,1297555200,"02 13, 2011",2011,2764,"['movie', 'just', 'everything', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'trite', 'stupid', 'got', 'insanely', 'dumb', 'plot', 'two-dimensional', 'characters', 'checklist', 'cliches', 'mile', 'long', 'wonder', ""n't"", 'collapse', 'own', 'pretension', 'turn', 'black', 'hole', 'yet', 'rather', 'liked', 'Oh', 'far', 'great', 'movie', 'certain', 'amount', 'charm.The', 'plot', 'such', 'centers', 'two', 'rival', 'dance', 'troupes', 'have', 'silly', 'names', 'call', 'houses', 'One', 'lead', 'handsome', 'charismatic', 'Luke', 'other', 'lead', 'handsome', 'charismatic', 'Julian', 'know', 'Julian', 'Eeeeevil', 'black', 'sinister', 'look', 'take', 'dancing', 'so', 'seriously', 'kept', 'having', 'flashbacks', 'South', 'Park', 'episode', 'Got', 'F', ""'d"", 'A', 'world', 'boy', 'unfortunate', 'nickname', 'Moose', 'Apparently', 'was', 'other', 'films', 'where', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'nickname', 'explained', 'played', 'Adam', 'G', 'Sevani', 'very', 'attractive', 'talented', 'young', 'dancer', 'who', 'distinct', 'impression', 'gay', 'person', 'trying', 'play', 'straight', 'falling', 'short', 'cute', 'charming', 'very', 'good', 'dancing.He', 'recruited', 'Luke', 'little', 'dance', 'troupe', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'Luke', 'home/rehearsal', 'space', 'be', 'foreclosed', 'Thankfully', 'dance', 'competition', 'coming', 'up', 'soon', 'prize', '100,000', 'astonishing', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'enough', 'cover', 'mortgage', 'large', 'space', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'whatever.The', 'plot', 'dancing', 'betrayal', 'dancing', 'romance', 'dancing', 'dancing', 'only', 'enough', 'plot', 'needed', 'move', 'film', 'forward', 'Really', 'reminded', 'one', 'porn', 'films', 'have', 'plot', 'when', 'really', 'audience', 'movie', 'do', 'what', 'meant', 'do', 'much', 'same', 'here', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'interested', 'two', 'hours', 'dancing', 'footage', 'zero', 'plot.Speaking', 'dancing', 'oh', 'goodness', 'Yes', 'quite', 'impressive', 'what', 'movie', 'seeing', 'really', 'worth', 'seeing', 'just', 'People', 'do', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'physically', 'possible', 'was', 'frankly', 'astonishing', 'what', 'people', 'can', 'do', 'bodies.But', 'do', 'have', 'objection', 'much', 'dancing', 'several', 'scenes', 'where', 'see', 'dancing', 'so', 'heavily', 'edited', 'very', 'hard', 'tell', 'exactly', 'what', 'going', 'follow', 'action', 'shame', 'real', 'talent', 'camera', ""n't"", 'take', 'enough', 'time', 'showcase', 'less', 'problem', 'end', 'film', 'major', 'issue', 'start.Ignoring', 'really', 'really', 'stupid', 'plot', 'fun', 'little', 'movie', 'can', 'just', 'put', 'brain', 'neutral', 'coast', 'along', ""'ll"", 'be', 'just', 'fine']",N/A

1385458,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B004529NKC,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[9, 11]","In 2006, the dance/romance film ""Step Up"" was born and it was a box office success with a budget of $12 million, ""Step Up"" would bring in $114 million worldwide.So, with the financial success of the first film, it was not surprising that a sequel  in 2008 titled ""Step Up 2: The Streets"" would be made and directing the film would be dancer and filmmaker John Chu (""Silent Beats"", ""When the Kids Are Away"", ""Justin Bieber: Never Say Never"").  Like its predecessor, the film would make a lot of money and surpass the first film by bringing over $148 million.And in 2010, John Chu returned as the director but this time bringing the third film to the big screen in 3D and to keep continuity with the first two films, ""Step Up 3"" would bring back actress Camille Gage (Alyson Stoner) from the first film and Adam Sevani (Moose) from the second film as new students at New York University.  And once again, like the previous two films, shot with a budget of $30 million, the third film would rake in $159 million worldwide.And now, ""Step Up 3"" arrives on Blu-ray and DVD on December 21st.  On Blu-ray, there will be two versions available, ""Step Up 3"" will be released in 3D (for those with 3D enabled Blu-ray players and TV sets) and normal Blu-ray on Blu-ray and DVD.""Step Up 3"" is a film that focus on three-related storylines.  The first focuses on the friendship between Moose (played by Adam Sevani) and Camille (played by Alyson Stoner, ""Camp Rock"" films, ""Phineas and Ferb"").  The two have grown up with each other and now both will be attending New York University.  Because the two are best friends, they want to enjoy their life as students together and are often mistaken as a couple.Moose loves to dance but he promised his parents (who is putting a lot of their money into their son's education) that he will focus on his engineering degree.  But on the first day of student orientation, he accidentally gets himself dragged into a dance battle and humiliates Kid Darkness, one of the premiere dancers of the House of Samurai Dance Crew.Meanwhile, as he is dancing, he is being taped by a guy named Luke, who happens to be the leader of a dance crew known as ""The House of the Pirates"".  Luke and his group want Moose to join them and be part of the House of Pirates and prepare for the World Jam Dance contest.  And because he humiliated Kid Darkness, he will become a target of the House of Samurai Dance Crew.Despite telling himself he wants to quit dancing, dancing is too much of a passion for Moose that he joins the House of Pirates but his friend Camille is unaware of why her best friend is ditching her all the time and is saddened that the promise they made of being together is not being fulfilled.  Also, how will Moose deal with college when the crew expects him to be training for the dance competition during his classes?The second storyline features the character of Luke (played by Rick Malambri, ""Surrogates"", ""Universal Soldiers"").  A filmmaker and the leader of the House of Pirates.  He also owns the building/warehouse which houses the dancers of the House of Pirates and as a promise to his dead parents, he wants to keep the building open.  So, people can train to dance and have a place to hang out and party.  But the building's rent has not been paid for six months and is in danger of closing.  And so the motivation for his dancers are to win the $100,000 grand prize to keep the warehouse open and they know they need more dancers for the competition to take on their rivals, the House of Samurai.The third storyline focuses on Luke and a dancer that he has fallen for.  Her name is Natalie (played by Sharni Vinson, ""Home and Away"") and he has been attracted to her for quite awhile.  He gives Natalie a place to stay and the two grow closer together and eventually fall for each other.  With the addition of Moose, Natalie also joins the House of Pirates.  But what Luke doesn't know is that Natalie is the sister of Julien (played by Joe Slaughter), the leader of the House of Samurai and Natalie was sent by him to spy on the House of Pirates dance crew.  But can Natalie hurt the House of Pirates after she has grown close to them and has become one of them?  Can she hurt Luke now that she has fallen in love with him?VIDEO:""Step Up 3"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1) and the first thing that came to my mind is how vibrant this film looks.  From the various shots of New York City to the use of color featured in the film, I was pretty impressed by the overall look and set design.  In the film, there is an interesting use of light and costume design and CG work which I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't watch the film.  A little TRON-esque but I was digging it!There is a lot of detail that is seen from the building sets, the closeups of the Nike vintage shoes to the characters and more.  I did notice some occasional banding on scenes where there was a lot of red.  But for the most part, picture quality is pretty fantastic and I noticed no blemishes, artifacts, combing, crush, etc.  Blacks were nice and deep and colors just pop!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Step Up 3"" features an English 7.1 DTS-HD (48 kHz/24-bit) lossless soundtrack.  Also, presented in French and Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1.  Dialogue and music is crystal clear and for low frequency, although not an action film, it's definitely a film that is driven by its music from Flo Rida (feat. David Guetta), Trey Songz, Jay-Z and Alicia Keys, Sofia Fresh (feat. T-Pain), Wisn y Yandel and more.  Bass is continually pumpin' and you could hear the resonance through your subwoofers when you hear that LFE.  Because of the 7.1 track, there is also use of surroound and rear surround throughout the film.Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Step Up 3"" comes with the following special features:* Born from a Boombox: A Luke Katcher Film - (11:51) The full ""Born from a Boombox"" film that the character Luke shot with interviews of the House of Pirates dancers.* Extra Moves - (7:20) Behind-the-scenes of ""Step Up 3"" with the making of the various dance scenes throughout the film and featuring the various music from the film.* Deleted Scenes - (23:57) Featuring optional intros by director Jon M.

The DVD is presented in widescreen (1:78:1 - enhanced for 169 televisions).  Audio is in English, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.JUDGMENT CALL:When it comes to dancing films, I know that there are film critics who just can't get into them.  But for me, I absolutely enjoy watching the choreography of these films and seeing how far they can take it to the next level.For me, the ""Step Up"" and ""Stomp the Yard"" films are known for their choreography and the plots are typically hit or miss with the viewer.  For ""Step Up 3"", I absolutely enjoyed the film, its plot, the music and the choreography.  Having friends who are part of the dancing scene, the dance battles and also into collecting those special edition, vintage Nike shoes, I enjoyed the integration of it into this film.  But while the dancing and the battles are a constant theme of these films, ""Step Up 3"" is a pretty stylish film.I have to admit that at first, seeing Rick Malambri as the male star of the film, I felt he was too clean cut for someone to be part of street dancing.  Someone you would see as more fashion model than someone who would lead a dance crew but everything worked out quite well.  Especially since the film incorporates so many characters, it helps when you have returning characters like Adam G. Sevani and Alyson Stoner as part of the film and the addition of Australian actress Sharni Vinson was quite interesting because similar to Rick Malambri, the first things that cross your mind is ""can these two dance?"".  And sure enough, both pulled it off.Also, it helps by by surrounding the two talents with a plethora of dancing talent and according to director Jon M. Chu, over 250 talented dancers were part of this film and these dancers are among the top dancers in the world.  So, if anything, these dancers help compliment the talent and also because of the additional dance talent, we are seeing various styles of dancing being incorporated to this third film that we haven't seen in the previous two films.And in many ways, I like the ""So You think You Can Dance"" style of mentality brought to this film by bringing these talent known for a certain style of dancing and then getting to learn various styles of choreography and each of these talented individuals have pulled it off.  The dancing of this film is phenomenal and for those who are passionate about dancing, I wouldn't be surprised if they rewind and play various scenes over and over and be in awe by it.As for the overall plot, yeah...there is a banality to it.  Goals to win contest money to save a club, to save one's hide.  Lover's betrayal and one being too occupied with other things and not being there for love ones.  Yeah, it's been done many times before but it works for this film.  Adam G. Sevani and Alyson Stoner have great chemistry and they bring in a young and enjoyable vibe to this film.  While Malambri and Sevani bring the more sexual and romantic aspect to the film.Also, I loved the cinematography and bringing that New York vibe to this film.  Also, loved how the colors were utilized and it's a vibrant film that really looks great on Blu-ray!  And of course, the music is pretty awesome.  From the characters of Luke and Moose traveling through New York with Jay-Z and Alicia Keys ""Empire State of Mind"" blaring through your front channel speakers to Flo Rida and David Guetta playing during a pretty cool dance scene and there are many more scenes with cool music, awesome choreography and memorable moments.The Blu-ray release has pretty awesome PQ and the music is more of the dominant factor for audio, while dialogue and music is crystal clear, there is some usage of the surround and rear surround channels.  But it's the music that dominates the soundspace.  Also, there are good number of special features that feature more dancing scenes and dancers that were cut out of the film due to pacing and making the scenes flow.As mentioned, there are two versions of this film being released on Blu-ray.  For those with a 3D Blu-ray player and 3D enabled television, you can purchase ""Step Up 3D"".  While those who don't have the 3D hardware or don't care for 3D can purchase the Blu-ray and DVD version of the film.Overall, I know that dance films are not for everyone.  But for those who love street dancing, ""Step Up 3"" is a pretty enjoyable film and the choreography was phenomenal.  If you enjoyed the previous two films, I definitely recommend ""Step Up 3"".",4,"Blu-ray: Awesome PQ/AQ, many special features and a Blu-ray for those who love awesome choreography and dancing

Sevani is a super talented young guy; his takeoff on Fred Astaire's""I Won't Dance Don't Ask Me"" is one of the best dance performances in movies since Gene Kelly - his partner Alyson Stoner is almost as good.On the other hand there are some faked up production numbers.

I watched my Avatar 3D Blu Ray one night and then watched this 3D Blu Ray the next night and I have to say that, IMHO, this movie wins hands down for 3D effect.  This movie literally was packed with jaw dropping 3D from start to finish! While Avatar is just plain visually stunning overall, Step Up 3D is without a doubt the BEST 3D Blu Ray I have watched to date.

I saw the movie trailer months ago and it was misleading in places. Sharni Vinson (who plays ""Natalie"") looks close enough to Briana Evigan from STEP UP 2 that I got tricked some. It ultimately didn't matter. The other thing you won't get from viewing the trailer is that the story isn't just about the two hot leads Sharni Vinson and Rick Malambri. The very likable, charmingly awkward Adam G. Sevani makes a welcome return as Moose, and this is just as much his story. Moose now attends NYU, majoring in engineering, his dance life very much in his rear view mirror. Except that last bit doesn't even last past his first day of college.Moose inadvertently gets tangled up in a dance battle with a member of the House of Samurai... and beats the guy (the balloons may have been overdoing it). The police get caught up in the drama; Moose runs away from the cops, gets hooked up by a budding filmmaker named Luke (Malambri). Luke is one of them good dudes. He's barely hanging on to a warehouse which serves as a home and dance studio for a tight-knit crew of street dancers calling itself the House of Pirates. Luke is five months late on the warehouse payments. Even the warehouse's subbing as a night club isn't making ends meet. The one hope is for the Pirates to compete - and win - in the first ever annual World Jam, the prize money being $100,000. Luke recruits Moose. Luke also recruits Natalie (Sharni Vinson), this mysterious hot chick, because what's a movie without gorgeous dames causing trouble?That's the plot, and it's predictable. But go with it. It's a platform for the phenomenal dance routines, which is what we came to see in a dance flick, anyway, right? Dramatically, really, only Adam G. Sevani and Alyson Stoner (""Camille"") come thru. Compared to the trifling, by-the-numbers stuff the two sexies, Vinson and Malambri, bring to the table, Sevani and Stoner's relationship feels more organic. You guys may remember Alyson Stoner as that standout kid featured in those Missy Elliott videos (Work It"" and ""Gossip Folks""). I wish she'd busted more moves here.Some of the world's best street dancers gather. And unlike another sorta similarly-themed movie I just saw (FAME remake), STEP UP 3 sizzles with dynamic energy and flair and passion and sheer showstopping stuff. These kids got moxie busting out their ears. The Santiago twins are a hoot. Moose has got skills for a gawky kid. And Chadd Smith is amazing. In his cool shades, dude is like the Terminator if the Terminator made a hobby of doing the Robot. That sick neck drop he does (Moose does it too) in the finals had me out of my seat yelling ""What the f-!""

While the first movie had a solid plot line and the second one had not as much of a solid plot line (but it was still there and it still made sense), this movie left me wanting more out of the plot.  The characters were not well developed, there was a hint of a plot line, but it still could've been better.The plot?  A young man (Adam Sevani of ""Step Up 2) and a young girl (Alyson Stoner of ""Step Up"") are going to college at NYU and Sevani meets up with this man making a film (Rick Malambri) about street dancing and Malambri sees that Sevani is really good, so he is recruited to dance at the World Jam.  Oh, and there's this other girl Natalie (Sharni Vinson) who shows up, too, and has a little bit of a secret that is revealed about halfway through the movie, removing that plot suspense.What was left out of the plot and character development for me, was made up with the dancing and music.  I know a few people go and see these movies just because of the dancing, but if I go see a movie, when they aren't dancing, I don't want to be bored and I don't want to be able to make several bathroom trips because I know that I won't be missing anything while I'm gone.I still enjoyed the movie, but I am personally getting tired of all of the 3D movies.  Some of the movies are great with it (Toy Story 3, for example, and Avatar), but this one could've done without it because their 3D effects were reminding me of those horrible 3D movies from the 1950s, where they're all in your face.  There were scenes in this movie where I know that if it was not a 3D movie, those scenes would not have been in there.  For example (and this isn't giving anything away because you can see the majority of these in the trailer), there is one part where they randomly go up on the top of this roof and stand on an air vent and drop straw-fulls of slushee in the air between them, making the slushee fly up in the audience's face.  At one dance-off, they were constantly blowing dust toward the audience, or they were dancing with their arms reaching right toward the camera, making it seem like they were about to hit you in the face.Those scenes are great if you are on the Terminator ride at Universal, but it's not something I want to see in a movie.But, as I said before, what was lacking with the plot line, characters, and sometimes the cheesy acting, was made up for with the phenomenal dancing.",3,Dancing makes up for it,1282003200,"08 17, 2010",2010,2498,"['Being', 'big', 'fan', 'other', 'two', 'Step', 'Up', 'movies', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'when', 'saw', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'first', 'movie', 'had', 'solid', 'plot', 'line', 'second', 'one', 'had', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'solid', 'plot', 'line', 'was', 'still', 'there', 'still', 'made', 'sense', 'movie', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'plot', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'well', 'developed', 'was', 'hint', 'plot', 'line', 'still', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better.The', 'plot', 'young', 'man', 'Adam', 'Sevani', 'Step', 'Up', '2', 'young', 'girl', 'Alyson', 'Stoner', 'Step', 'Up', 'are', 'going', 'college', 'NYU', 'Sevani', 'up', 'man', 'making', 'film', 'Rick', 'Malambri', 'street', 'dancing', 'Malambri', 'Sevani', 'really', 'good', 'recruited', 'dance', 'World', 'Jam', 'Oh', 'other', 'girl', 'Natalie', 'Sharni', 'Vinson', 'who', 'up', 'too', 'little', 'bit', 'secret', 'revealed', 'halfway', 'movie', 'removing', 'plot', 'suspense.What', 'was', 'left', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'made', 'up', 'dancing', 'music', 'know', 'few', 'people', 'go', 'see', 'movies', 'just', 'dancing', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'when', 'are', ""n't"", 'dancing', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'bored', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'several', 'bathroom', 'trips', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'missing', 'anything', ""'m"", 'gone.I', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'am', 'personally', 'getting', 'tired', '3D', 'movies', 'movies', 'are', 'great', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'example', 'Avatar', 'one', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', '3D', 'effects', 'were', 'reminding', 'horrible', '3D', 'movies', '1950s', 'where', ""'re"", 'face', 'were', 'scenes', 'movie', 'where', 'know', 'was', 'not', '3D', 'movie', 'scenes', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'there', 'example', ""n't"", 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'can', 'see', 'majority', 'trailer', 'one', 'part', 'where', 'randomly', 'go', 'up', 'top', 'roof', 'stand', 'air', 'vent', 'drop', 'straw-fulls', 'slushee', 'air', 'making', 'slushee', 'fly', 'up', 'audience', 'face', 'one', 'dance-off', 'were', 'constantly', 'blowing', 'dust', 'audience', 'were', 'dancing', 'arms', 'reaching', 'right', 'camera', 'making', 'seem', 'were', 'about', 'hit', 'face.Those', 'scenes', 'are', 'great', 'are', 'Terminator', 'ride', 'Universal', 'not', 'something', 'want', 'see', 'movie.But', 'said', 'what', 'was', 'lacking', 'plot', 'line', 'characters', 'sometimes', 'cheesy', 'acting', 'was', 'made', 'up', 'phenomenal', 'dancing']",N/A

One of the things that I love about it is that the dancers may be quirky or awkward in plot scenes, but when they'e dancing they are so powerful and confident, it's like they become superheroes (moose in particular).Step up 3 makes the right decision to cut down on plot and drama and let the dancing take the spotlight. Yes there is a story, but it's not bogged down by disapproving parents or stodgy ballet instructors. Everyone starts out as good dancers so there aren't any unnecessary montages of bad dancers fumbling around (though there are some great training sequences of everyone showing off). The conflicts are sometimes so ludicrous it's hilarious. The acting is fine, these are fantasy people who live in beautiful colorful world where conflicts are settled with dance battles in the bathroom, they're charming and happy go lucky and I wouldn't want it any other way.The dancing is amazing! There are so many styles and every dancer injects their own personality into it. The interactions between crews during battles were really interesting. They'll trade blows and react to each others moves and sometimes mock the other crews style. They really made an effort to resolve plot in the dancing instead of having plot and dancing separate. The choreography is stellar and the cinematography is significantly improved since Step Up 2. It's really bright and colorful and the contrast and framing allows for you to see all the intricacies of the choreography.  I particularly appreciated that the dancing can be flirty without being sexual or vulgar.I just go through this movie with a huge grin on my face and the battles are great to watch over and over. I just can't get enough of this movie.The only complaint I have is that I would like to have a commentary or more special features with the director talking about his process.

I guess you would ask why a person in their 40s wanted to see Step Up 3. I will tell you why....it was pure fun. There was a decent story line, but the dance scenes (especially the guy who rocked the robot) to die for. Ok, now the plot of the film. An aspiring film maker (and dancer) is trying to save his home, which also happens to be the homes for several homeless dancers. Winning a competition will pay the bills and save the warehouse from foreclosure. He has a strong sense of obligation to the kids who live there and finds himself slightly distracted by a beautiful dancer who isn't what she seems. The other main character is a college student who is temporarily ignoring his best friend because of his overwhelming need to dance. The two (the film maker and the college student/dancer) have bonded based a solid friendship out of their love for the arts.Why them do I give this campy yet charming movie a 5? It was pure fun. It's my opinion that the guy who did the robot scenes stole the show and the water (dance)  sequence  rocked. I also enjoyed the behind the scene stuff and extra videos. The story was easy to follow, and while not to original enjoyable, and the music was great and offered a wonderful escape from reality.

I'm just not cheery enough of a person to take a serious interest in an activity in which all committed participants are joyfully dancing and hopping around all - the - time. But hey, more power to them right? That's not me, but I kind of wish it was, you know?Honestly the story serves as an excuse to show off some killer dance moves. You can tell these people work hard, and showing off that talent is the sole purpose of this movie. I don't take the drama seriously in the least--they all seem too cheery and bubbly to go to ""war"" with other dance troupes--but the moves are cool and the 3D probably takes the cake out of any other current live action BluRay 3D (barring Avatar maybe, and it's definitely better than RE Afterlife in terms of the 3D). A lot of the 3D is behind the screen and those shots all look real, like you're on set. The ""out of screen"" effects never seem forced either; they never seem like a pointless gag. Rather the few ""pop out"" effects that the director employs are more along the lines of ""holy crap that's awesome!"" when they are used. You never get sick of it, like you're being fed a gimmick. Usually it's a close up of a dancer, and it feels like you're right there in the crowd, like the guy/girl is trying to involve you in the show.Bottom line: the script isn't amazing but it's not awful. Acting isn't the best but it's not horrid. The story is pleasant enough so that you're not hoping for the movie to end, and the dancing/3D filming are engaging enough to make you wish there was just a little bit more.

This movie really could be its own movie and doesn't really need to connect with the first two movies. But still, it does connect in a way. In the last two movies, the main story was about a troubled young adult star that goes to a performing art school for high school. Then, through dance, he/she learns to have a better life and has a bring future.In this movie there is more depth with the story. It's about a guy named Luke. He finds and leads a group of talented dancers to become a family of dancers all with their own unique style of dance. All these dancers want to make it big as dancers, but have no where to go to do that until Luke comes and lead them. Another new dancer that Luke finds is Moose and he is a return actor from Step Up 2. Moose doesn't know what he wants to do about dance because he is actually going to school as an engineering major. He then decides to join the group. Another dancer in the grop is Natalie. There a whole plot story with her but I don't want to spolier it for you and won't tell what that is. There still another of other things that I haven't talked about the movie yet, but instead you should watch it and enjoy it.In this movie you will hear amazing music, and see hot dance moves!

1385508,A21SVQPB3BMIZO,B004529NKC,Shadow Walker,"[73, 74]","If I were rating Step Up 3D simply based on the acting or writing - you know, the usual movie criteria - then I'd have to give two stars out of five, at most. Heck, to this day I have trouble remembering the two lead characters' names because they were so bland and had zero personality. The only person I *do* remember clearly is Moose, played by Adam Sevani.However, no one watches this sort of movie for the stellar acting or plot. There was one reason, and one reason only, why I watched Step Up 3D - the dancing! And in that respect, the movie more than delivered. The dancing is absolutely fantastic. It's the sort of movie that makes you want to get up and dance yourself, or attempt to, anyway. And for a dance movie, I don't think there's any higher praise.Another surprising highlight of this film was the 3d! It might sound laughable, but I think Step Up showcases some of the best use of 3D since Avatar. No, really. I think the difference between Step Up 3D and all of those other post-Avatar movies is that most of the latter were filmed in 2d and later converted to 3d film, whereas Step Up 3D was conceived in 3d and filmed with 3d cameras from the start. With other movies that have been converted to 3d, the 3d seems like nothing more than a dumb gimmick meant to drive up box office receipts. Step Up 3D on the other hand fully utilizes 3d technology in order to make the dancing really 'pop.' Unfortunately, since 3d-capable TVs are still a relative rarity, most people who watch the movie at home won't be able to see Step Up in 3d format.In short: The acting? Meh. The characterization?

I could understand it if the plot was original, but it was your basic ""love, betrayal"" line with the cookie side kick.in a lot of places, i felt like the the main character who owned the dance building was screwing over Moose repeatedly just because he only cared for himself. Moose was awesome, as always, but there simply was too much useless dialogue and romance BS you see in every other movie. The end dance was the best, of course. The dance scenes were short though... Step up 2 was and is the best of the step ups, in my opinion.still: LXD.
