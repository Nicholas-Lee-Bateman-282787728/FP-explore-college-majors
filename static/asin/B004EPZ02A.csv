I'm a big fan of the previous Paranormal Activity films and I am delighted with this third instalment. It's a huge achievement to take this story on a ride that has all the ingredients from the other two episodes yet somehow manages to improve the experience by ranking up the terror.How can they succeed for a third bloody time? Well, once you introduce a good back story and add a creative combination of talented child actors, camera stillness and unpredictable moments, you've absolutely smashed it! Children are known to be more susceptible to the spirit world as we observed in the original Poltergeist (1982) and the ground-breaking The Exorcist (1973). In this film the two children's traumatic experience reminds many of us those forgotten memories of vulnerability we went through, the nightmares and the difficulty sleeping after watching something we probably shouldn't have.Set in 1988 the whole piece captures this period with accuracy, the colours used and ornaments, lighting fixtures the and 80's hair styles is a great example of commitment and attention to detail. I watched this with the bleedingwife and when the ride had finished she admitted to closing her eyes during the final minutes because it was far scarier than the other two films. I have to agree, it is bloody scary and I enjoyed every second. There are many genius touches with this production that really surprised me, they have perfected this hand held camera genre more than other attempts. However, at this point we must not forget  to pay maximum respect and thanks to the original, one and only, `The Blair Witch Project' (1999) that not only set the bar in terms of low budget capabilities and original simple camera work, but managed to market the BWP in such a unique way. I don't think any other film since has been able to repeat the `is it real or not' speculation to such a all media snowball effect.This PA franchise proves you don't need buckets of blood or special effects to scare the hell out of your audience. Simple, back to basics film making that every wannabe horror film maker should study. What clever hand held camera concept is going to overtake this one I wonder?If you were not impressed with the other two, then I doubt you would be keen to watch this. Many people just don't get the Paranormal Activity experience, it's too slow for them, they get bored quickly because they watch fast paced films that cascade a stream of impact moments because film makers are fearful the audience will loose interest.I can see where they could go with Paranormal Activity 4, it would have to be set in present day or a totally different environment, like a secured vulnerable patients unit.bleedingcriticbleedingfilms.com",4,bleedingfilms.com review of  'Paranormal Activity 3'',1334707200,"04 18, 2012",2012,2832,"['Sequels', 'prequels', 'are', 'expected', 'be', 'disappointing', 'third', 'instalments', 'are', 'definitely', 'cursed', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'previous', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'films', 'am', 'delighted', 'third', 'instalment', 'huge', 'achievement', 'take', 'story', 'ride', 'ingredients', 'other', 'two', 'episodes', 'yet', 'somehow', 'manages', 'improve', 'experience', 'ranking', 'up', 'terror.How', 'can', 'succeed', 'third', 'bloody', 'time', 'Well', 'once', 'introduce', 'good', 'back', 'story', 'add', 'creative', 'combination', 'talented', 'child', 'actors', 'camera', 'stillness', 'unpredictable', 'moments', ""'ve"", 'absolutely', 'smashed', 'Children', 'are', 'known', 'be', 'more', 'susceptible', 'spirit', 'world', 'observed', 'original', 'Poltergeist', '1982', 'ground-breaking', 'Exorcist', '1973', 'film', 'two', 'children', 'traumatic', 'experience', 'many', 'forgotten', 'memories', 'vulnerability', 'went', 'nightmares', 'difficulty', 'sleeping', 'watching', 'something', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'have.Set', '1988', 'whole', 'piece', 'period', 'accuracy', 'colours', 'used', 'ornaments', 'lighting', 'fixtures', '80', 'hair', 'styles', 'great', 'example', 'commitment', 'attention', 'detail', 'watched', 'bleedingwife', 'when', 'ride', 'had', 'finished', 'admitted', 'closing', 'eyes', 'final', 'minutes', 'was', 'far', 'scarier', 'other', 'two', 'films', 'have', 'agree', 'bloody', 'scary', 'enjoyed', 'second', 'are', 'many', 'genius', 'touches', 'production', 'really', 'surprised', 'have', 'perfected', 'hand', 'held', 'camera', 'genre', 'more', 'other', 'attempts', 'However', 'point', 'must', 'not', 'forget', 'pay', 'maximum', 'respect', 'thanks', 'original', 'one', 'only', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', '1999', 'not', 'only', 'set', 'bar', 'terms', 'low', 'budget', 'capabilities', 'original', 'simple', 'camera', 'work', 'managed', 'market', 'BWP', 'such', 'unique', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'other', 'film', 'been', 'able', 'repeat', 'real', 'not', 'speculation', 'such', 'media', 'snowball', 'effect.This', 'PA', 'franchise', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'buckets', 'blood', 'special', 'effects', 'scare', 'hell', 'audience', 'Simple', 'back', 'basics', 'film', 'making', 'wannabe', 'horror', 'film', 'maker', 'should', 'study', 'What', 'clever', 'hand', 'held', 'camera', 'concept', 'going', 'overtake', 'one', 'wonder', 'were', 'not', 'impressed', 'other', 'two', 'then', 'doubt', 'would', 'be', 'keen', 'watch', 'Many', 'people', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'experience', 'too', 'slow', 'get', 'bored', 'quickly', 'watch', 'fast', 'paced', 'films', 'cascade', 'stream', 'impact', 'moments', 'film', 'makers', 'are', 'fearful', 'audience', 'will', 'loose', 'interest.I', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'could', 'go', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '4', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'set', 'present', 'day', 'totally', 'different', 'environment', 'secured', 'vulnerable', 'patients', 'unit.bleedingcriticbleedingfilms.com']",Paranormal Activity 3
1402305,AAZRWLML88IZK,B004EPZ02A,A kids review,"[1, 1]","The insanely successful horror series that is the Paranormal Activity franchise saw its third installment in as many years hit theaters last October, and after a dip in quality with the second film, Paranormal Activity 3 turned out to be a bit of an improvement. This time around, viewers are taken back to the beginning of the haunting central to the series, specifically the late '80s childhood experiences of sisters Katie and Kristi. Around the same time young Kristi begins having regular conversations with an ""imaginary friend"" named Toby, her mother Julie and Julie's boyrfriend Dennis begin experiencing unexplained phenomena in their house. As things steadily grow out of control, dark family secrets are revealed until, finally, all hell breaks loose. I found PA3 to be a modest improvement over its predecessor; though it's tough for any horror sequel not to run out of steam with each new installment, this one still manages to provide some suitably chilling moments. It's nothing you haven't seen before, but if you enjoyed the first two, you'll likely have a good time with this one, too.",2,Paranormal Activity 3,1328054400,"02 1, 2012",2012,1103,"['insanely', 'successful', 'horror', 'series', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'franchise', 'saw', 'third', 'installment', 'many', 'years', 'hit', 'theaters', 'last', 'October', 'dip', 'quality', 'second', 'film', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '3', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'bit', 'improvement', 'time', 'around', 'viewers', 'are', 'taken', 'back', 'beginning', 'haunting', 'central', 'series', 'specifically', 'late', ""'80s"", 'childhood', 'experiences', 'sisters', 'Katie', 'Kristi', 'same', 'time', 'young', 'Kristi', 'having', 'regular', 'conversations', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'named', 'Toby', 'mother', 'Julie', 'Julie', 'boyrfriend', 'Dennis', 'begin', 'experiencing', 'unexplained', 'phenomena', 'house', 'things', 'steadily', 'grow', 'control', 'dark', 'family', 'secrets', 'are', 'revealed', 'finally', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'found', 'PA3', 'be', 'modest', 'improvement', 'predecessor', 'tough', 'horror', 'sequel', 'not', 'run', 'out', 'steam', 'new', 'installment', 'one', 'still', 'provide', 'suitably', 'chilling', 'moments', 'nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'two', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'one', 'too']",Paranormal Activity 3

Anyhow, a lot of people have complained and/or mentioned that a great many scenes released via the trailers were not actually in the movie.

I would say there are probably 5-6 added scenes that really do contribute to the story and make the film a little clearer. I was initially a little apprehensive to put money down for the Extended version because typically that doesn't mean much, but I would definitely recommend this to any lover of the films. Even if they already saw it in theatres. This version even included a couple scares and jumps that I personally don't remember from any of the trailers.

Basically you have to be invested in the story and it's a good one.  In PA #1 and PA #2 we have two sisters who slowly come to realize that there is something supernatural going on in their homes.  It's alluded that something happened in their childhood, something they seem to have forgotten about or buried in their memories that might be linked to what is going on in their homes.  Each installment of the Paranormal series has a reason why their homes are being video taped and PA #3 is no exception.In PA #3, we are taken back to the sisters as little girls, living with their Mom and stepfather.  In short time, strange things start to happen, loud unexplained noises, movement, and Toby, who is Kristi's imaginary playmate.  The stepfather videos weddings for a living and knows a lot about cameras so he sets up a 24/7 surveillance of the house in all rooms.  In the kitchen having a camera panning left to right you might think the most horrifying reveal might be dirty dishes in the sink but you get much more than that.As always this PA movie has it's viewers trained to always be on guard.  This is one of those movies that you might have to watch  through little spaces between your fingers as you peek through your hands as they cover your eyes.  I've glad I don't remember the trailer for this movie because I understand many viewers were upset that most of these scenes were not included in the actual movie.Where this movie fails is that it's way too short and even though this is a horror film it's also a mystery and it sort of cheapens #3 in that you know so much is left out so they can make PA #4.  All in all, this movie delivered in making me sleep with the lights on and steering clear of kids who introduce me to a playmate I can't see.",4,"If You Don't Want to See Results, Don't Videotape Your Home",1328400000,"02 5, 2012",2012,1968,"['are', 'only', 'two', 'ways', 'can', 'feel', 'movie', 'will', 'either', 'really', 'will', 'want', 'money/time', 'back', ""'m"", 'former', 'camp', 'do', 'understand', 'why', 'have', 'not', 'liked', 'movie', 'Basically', 'have', 'be', 'invested', 'story', 'good', 'one', 'PA', '1', 'PA', '2', 'have', 'two', 'sisters', 'who', 'slowly', 'come', 'realize', 'something', 'supernatural', 'going', 'homes', 'alluded', 'something', 'happened', 'childhood', 'something', 'seem', 'have', 'forgotten', 'buried', 'memories', 'might', 'be', 'linked', 'what', 'going', 'homes', 'installment', 'Paranormal', 'series', 'reason', 'why', 'homes', 'are', 'being', 'video', 'taped', 'PA', '3', 'exception.In', 'PA', '3', 'are', 'taken', 'back', 'sisters', 'little', 'girls', 'living', 'Mom', 'stepfather', 'short', 'time', 'strange', 'things', 'start', 'happen', 'loud', 'unexplained', 'noises', 'movement', 'Toby', 'who', 'Kristi', 'imaginary', 'playmate', 'stepfather', 'videos', 'weddings', 'living', 'lot', 'cameras', 'so', 'up', '24/7', 'surveillance', 'house', 'rooms', 'kitchen', 'having', 'camera', 'panning', 'left', 'right', 'might', 'think', 'most', 'horrifying', 'reveal', 'might', 'be', 'dirty', 'dishes', 'sink', 'get', 'much', 'more', 'that.As', 'always', 'PA', 'movie', 'viewers', 'trained', 'always', 'be', 'guard', 'one', 'movies', 'might', 'have', 'watch', 'little', 'spaces', 'fingers', 'peek', 'hands', 'cover', 'eyes', ""'ve"", 'glad', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'trailer', 'movie', 'understand', 'many', 'viewers', 'were', 'upset', 'most', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'included', 'actual', 'movie.Where', 'movie', 'way', 'too', 'short', 'even', 'horror', 'film', 'also', 'mystery', 'sort', 'cheapens', '3', 'know', 'so', 'much', 'left', 'out', 'can', 'make', 'PA', '4', 'movie', 'delivered', 'making', 'sleep', 'lights', 'steering', 'clear', 'kids', 'who', 'introduce', 'playmate', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see']",Paranormal Activity 3

Dennis is a videographer doing mostly weddings but he starts to put his cameras around the house when things start to get a little weird.

With the Paranormal Activity franchise we now have a trilogy in which nothing happens thrice.  I can barely forgive myself for seeing the second one after thinking of the first one that if they had spent another day and another couple hundred dollars, perhaps there could have been some actual event in the film.  And now that I've seen the third one, I just want to stab out my own eyes and shove chopsticks into my tympanic membranes to prevent myself ever again paying for this inert junk.I understand the idea of dread gradually building up over time.  I agree that in general, this method provides a far creepier, scarier, more satisfying horror experience than does a frenetic spray of viscera and gore aimed at the screen.  But waiting through scenes of endlessly panning camera shots (the use of a oscillating fan as a camera mount was a nice touch, however) for something, anything to happen gets BORING.  And my idea of an action film isMy Dinner with Andre (The Criterion Collection), so I'm not exactly ADHD in my entertainment demands.I think a judicious editing together of all three films into one compact, 90-minute anthology would result in a very chilling, dread-filled, satisfying movie experience.

Dennis (Christopher Nicholas Smith), is alone in the house, but he hears a noise. He looks through the house and then the girl's upstairs room of Kate & Kristi (Jessica Brown).

Suddenly, he notices Kristi standing behind him.Later that night, Dennis and his girlfriend, Julie (Lauren Bittner), decide to make an amateur sex tape in their bedroom. They hear strange noises, but continue their love-making. Suddenly, an earthquake happens.The next morning, Dennis looks at the video of the earthquake after they had left the bedroom.

Old school baby, tracking problems and all.  Speaking of problems, the third installment of this franchise - one I have enjoyed somewhat - goes significantly off-track in this prequel revisal.  In previous (read: future) films the spirit (Toby) is unmistakably evil, but in this version the paranormal has a range of emotions...as odd as it sounds.  Friend to foe, playful at times, the consistency is severely lacking.  Compounding this problem is the bizarre twist at the end in which the family history alluded to in the previous two films is sloppily exposed in an abbreviated final act.What this film does deliver is historical perspective and solid acting.  The viewer finds out why the family's lineage has been haunted, as well as the source of the haunting.  But, as mentioned, it just isn't cohesive enough to truly enjoy.  A seasoned viewer is likely to watch this third installment and crack jokes through most of the scenes because we know just about when attention is required.

In this installment, we see how the storyline from the earlier films began.Julie, along with her young daughters Katie, Kristi, and live-in boyfriend Dennis have just moved into a new home.  Once settled, strange occurances start happening.  Videographer Dennis immediately sets up cameras throughout the house, hoping to capture anything strange on tape.  Meanwhile, Kristi has developed an imaginary friend she calls Toby.  With some prodding from her mom, Kristi reveals that Toby has been speaking to her.  Even more confused and anxious now, Dennis continues his monitoring.  He has even set up a camera on an old oscillating fan base.As the movie progresses, the bumps and noises turn into other more scary things, such as beds being moved across the room and items crashing to the floor.  In the end, the  evil forces unleash their full fury upon the family.While there are some truly scary parts in this movie, such as when Randy and one of the girls shut themselves in the bathroom and say ""Bloody Mary"" three times to when Katie is suspended in air by her hair, overall I thought the first two movies were scarier.  I thought that the oscillating camera was a nice trick, and the anticipation of watching the camera slowly pan from one room to the other helped add to the suspense of the movie.

I actually like the sequel more than the original.Part 3 is just as clever in its construction as Part 2, and I'm grateful to the filmmakers for giving us what we **remember** VHS looking like, not what it **actually** looks like!But the problem with PA 3 is that it's more ""hollywood"" than #2 was, making the unknown horror of the first two films into something closer to a ""franchise monster"" like Freddy Kreuger or Chucky. We now know roughly the size and shape of ""IT"", we know what ""IT"" sounds like,  ""IT"" now has a name and, as we see, an origin of sorts.#3 also suffers from Hollywood sequel-itis. For example, if pots and pans falling on a kitchen floor was scary, then the entire contents of a kitchen falling is scarier, right? Right? Nope.Another Hollywoodism: Anything for a scare. Even if it doesn't fit, or make sense with what we already know.And then there's the standard ""They definitely know they're in danger but stay anyway,"" which worked under the circumstances of Part One but makes no sense here, especially with the kids in danger. If you sat and watched videos of your kid being pushed around by an invisible monster, you probably wouldn't have her sleep in the same room that night. Probably...So, ultimately, I guess I'm glad I know the whole story (or as much as I need to know).

1402356,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B004EPZ02A,J from NY,"[6, 9]","Paranormal Activity 3 is the best addition to the PA series since the groundbreaking first film.  As my girlfriend shook while the credits rolled, I heard nearly everyone in the theater exclaim ""What a disappointment!"".  I guess we were watching a different film; opening with the unfortunate Katie and pregnant Christie, an ill fated man decides to take a gander at the Blair Witch sisters' odd childhood (recorded a bit improbably on a variety of VHS tapes from the 80's which did not exist at the time.)As might be expected the two little girls had an unpleasant childhood.  No, no abuse, no missed meals, no glue sniffing, but something far more insidious and subtle ails the two lads. Christopher Nicolas Smith delivers a pretty good performance for a guy in a film which is videotaped with a homemade camera as does Lauren Bitner.  Daddy Dennis and Mommy Julie have got to be the unluckiest parents on earth if you forget about the whole Casey Anthony thing--anyway, without spoiling anything, we finally get to meet Grandma.  She sort of makes the film along with Toby.Paranormal Activity 2was not a bad movie and by necessity developed the storyline from the original; this is the reflection it needed, packing the same threadless, ""What the Hell is Going On?"" terror of the first.

1402358,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B004EPZ02A,John's Horror Corner,"[2, 3]","First off, I should say that I LOVED parts one and two. The first two relied more heavily on very slow-building tension. These predecessors basically ""taught"" viewers how to watch these movies in the first 20-30 minutes by offering numerous subtle, relatively unimportant objects moving as if a spectral breeze had shifted them. This way when such production devices became important, the viewer had a trained eye--not unlike what was done with White Noise. These movies convey a style that is very unusual. So it came as no surprise to me that there was little middle ground in people's opinions of them; they loved'em or hated'em. I love'em. Why? Because my senses are all on full power; I'm all in; I'm practically concentrating on the screen and listening to every creak trying to sleuth out the next clue that something fishy is going on in that house. Some people may call this ""work"". I call it cool. [But people chatting during the movie are a much greater distraction than normal under the circumstances.]This third installment was my least favorite, but I can totally understand why it may be others' favorite. While it still employed subtle moving objects, it did it less, instead relying on more mainstream devices to provoke scared jumps from the audience. It also borrowed more heavily from the Poltergeist movies than the first two--not that I minded. The characters' investigation into the strange goings-on was more methodical and plot-driven. The first two were more event-driven and investigated more out of fear and curiosity. The differences between 3 and 1 & 2 were subtle, but numerous, chief amongst them being that ""the paranormal"" functions as a character in this movie, rather than a mysterious ""force"" in the first two. As such, the actions of ""the paranormal"" were more blatant and felt more like ""it"" was doing something ""to someone"" whereas in 1 & 2 it was more like ""something was happening"" to someone in a haunted house.The plot is simple. A family lives in a house. Weird things start happening. Step-dad starts putting cameras around the house. Things get weirder. And from there anything more would give too much away. But while the first two movies' endings left us largely to wild speculation, I will say that this one ends with something of an explanation of the paranormal activity.It doesn't really matter in which order you watch these movies. However, each sequel (or in this case prequel) was designed to mold over the events of the previous installment. So watch them in order if it's convenient. I also demand you watch these with the lights off. It makes it easier to avoid distractions while you're concentrating on the screen.",4,Some people's favorite and my least favorite of the franchise...but I say see it either way!,1335225600,"04 24, 2012",2012,2676,"['First', 'should', 'say', 'LOVED', 'parts', 'one', 'two', 'first', 'two', 'relied', 'more', 'heavily', 'very', 'slow-building', 'tension', 'predecessors', 'basically', 'taught', 'viewers', 'how', 'watch', 'movies', 'first', '20-30', 'minutes', 'offering', 'numerous', 'subtle', 'relatively', 'unimportant', 'objects', 'moving', 'spectral', 'breeze', 'had', 'shifted', 'way', 'when', 'such', 'production', 'devices', 'became', 'important', 'viewer', 'had', 'trained', 'eye', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'done', 'White', 'Noise', 'movies', 'convey', 'style', 'very', 'unusual', 'came', 'surprise', 'was', 'little', 'middle', 'ground', 'people', 'opinions', ""loved'em"", ""hated'em"", ""love'em"", 'Why', 'senses', 'are', 'full', 'power', ""'m"", ""'m"", 'practically', 'concentrating', 'screen', 'listening', 'creak', 'trying', 'sleuth', 'out', 'next', 'clue', 'something', 'fishy', 'going', 'house', 'people', 'may', 'call', 'work', 'call', 'cool', '[', 'people', 'chatting', 'movie', 'are', 'much', 'greater', 'distraction', 'normal', 'circumstances', ']', 'third', 'installment', 'was', 'least', 'favorite', 'can', 'totally', 'understand', 'why', 'may', 'be', 'others', 'favorite', 'still', 'employed', 'subtle', 'moving', 'objects', 'did', 'less', 'instead', 'relying', 'more', 'mainstream', 'devices', 'provoke', 'scared', 'jumps', 'audience', 'also', 'borrowed', 'more', 'heavily', 'Poltergeist', 'movies', 'first', 'two', 'not', 'minded', 'characters', 'investigation', 'strange', 'goings-on', 'was', 'more', 'methodical', 'plot-driven', 'first', 'two', 'were', 'more', 'event-driven', 'investigated', 'more', 'fear', 'curiosity', 'differences', '3', '1', '2', 'were', 'subtle', 'numerous', 'chief', 'being', 'paranormal', 'functions', 'character', 'movie', 'rather', 'mysterious', 'force', 'first', 'two', 'such', 'actions', 'paranormal', 'were', 'more', 'blatant', 'felt', 'more', 'was', 'doing', 'something', 'someone', 'whereas', '1', '2', 'was', 'more', 'something', 'was', 'happening', 'someone', 'haunted', 'house.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'family', 'house', 'Weird', 'things', 'start', 'happening', 'Step-dad', 'starts', 'putting', 'cameras', 'house', 'Things', 'get', 'weirder', 'anything', 'more', 'would', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'endings', 'left', 'largely', 'wild', 'speculation', 'will', 'say', 'one', 'something', 'explanation', 'paranormal', 'activity.It', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'order', 'watch', 'movies', 'However', 'sequel', 'case', 'prequel', 'was', 'designed', 'mold', 'over', 'events', 'previous', 'installment', 'So', 'watch', 'order', 'convenient', 'also', 'demand', 'watch', 'lights', 'off', 'easier', 'avoid', 'distractions', ""'re"", 'concentrating', 'screen']",Paranormal Activity 3

The movie is a prequel to the original Paranormal Activity and follows Katie, Kristi and their parents back in 1988.This film is basically the same as the first 2 since it follows the same formula: weird things happen, father/husband sets up camera(s), sleeping and more strange things happen, and a frantic ending occurs. If you're not tired of this structure yet, then this may not bother you at all but, it's also a bit predictable. The scares were decent, I felt like this one used more jump-out scares, though. I did enjoy the Bloody Mary sequence with Randy and Katie, though; especially when the furniture is thrown and only Toby's chair is in it's place. One problem with these films and this may only be me, but sometimes during the long shots of them sleeping or doing everyday activities, my eyes are always wandering as I tried to figure out what I'm supposed to be looking at. I'm a fan of supernatural horror, so I found the film to be entertaining, nonetheless, but it's really nothing special.Paranormal Activity 3 is more of the same. If you're not a fan of the series or found footage films in general, then you're probably better off avoiding this.

1402366,A3TMS14RL9Q0R1,B004EPZ02A,"K. Sommerfield ""Slasher Studios""","[6, 11]","""Paranormal Activity 3' is the funniest movie you will see in theaters all year. From start to finish it is loaded with gut busting laughs that you will be eager to tell you friends about. The problem? It's not a comedy...at all. In fact it is deadly seriously from beginning to end which only added to the fun. Once in a full moon horror audiences get to experience this sort of bad filmmaking. A film that plummets below mediocre into so-bad-it's-good territory. This is just that film.""Paranormal Activity 3' begins in 2005, Katie delivers a box of old videotapes to her pregnant sister, Kristi, and Kristi's husband, Daniel. A year later, Kristi and Daniel's house is seemingly burgled and the tapes are missing. Flashback to 1988, a young Katie and Kristi live with their mother, Julie, and her boyfriend, Dennis; Kristi begins interacting with an invisible friend named Toby. Dennis notices that since Kristi's friend appeared, strange things have been happening in the house. Dennis and Julie try to make a sex tape, but are interrupted by an earthquake. While they look for the girls, the camera shows dust fall from the ceiling and land onto an invisible figure in the room. The figure then moves and the dust falls to the floor.While reviewing the footage later, Dennis notices the strange incident. He invites his friend Randy over to view the footage, who suggests that Dennis place cameras throughout the house to capture any other incidents.That night in the girls' bedroom, Kristi wakes up and begins talking to someone off-camera before going back to bed. When Dennis questions her about this the following day, Kristi tells him that it is Toby. After more disturbed nights and strange occurrences, Dennis discovers a strange symbol in the girls' closet. He finds the same symbol on a picture of women in a book about demonology. Dennis explains to Julie that the symbol belonged to a witches' coven that brainwashed girls of child-bearing age into having sons and then forgetting about it, but Julie dismisses his claim. Because, of course, he HAS to be making this all up. Right?Hmmm...where to start with the problems of this film:* Sometimes there is a time stamp on the camera, sometimes there isn't.* Who is editing the jump cuts when there is no ""flash forward"" in time?* Who was changing the tapes in the middle of the night?* Why is the camera looking over at the parents bed when it is staring straight at the mirror?* Why didn't the babysitter say what had happened to her to the parents?* Why didn't the Randy show them his cut after he was attacked by ""Toby""?* Why was Toby never mentioned in the first two installments?* Why didn't Dennis show Julie the tapes before going into the stupid speech about the witches?* Was the final scene (witches in black robes?) really meant to be taken seriously?* Didn't the video quality appear to be awfully good (and in HD even!!) for something that had been 25 years old and sitting in storage?* Also did the witches edit the tapes together themselves?The list goes on and on and on. This is quite the movie experience that really must be seen to be believed. Go in with a few beers and zero thoughts in your head and maybe you'll have a good time. Who knows?

While the DVD boasts, ""The last 15 minutes will mess you up for life"" have no fear - it really won't. It just provides the explanation.Back in the 80s when Kristi and Katie were young girls, their mother, Julie, and her boyfriend, Dennis, move into a new home. Dennis videotapes weddings and so we have our collection of video recordings of how this new house is haunted.Kristi has an invisible friend named Toby and this thing wants something; least of all being called fat.

Then she plays Bloody Mary with Dennis' assistant and the house begins to come apart.While there are a few jump-in-your-seat scares, this film simply cannot recapture the building dread of the original. (But I will admit that a scare involving a closet did cause my heart to literally stop for a split second.) You'll get the multiple camera angels: two bedroom shots and the kitchen. You'll get the sudden kitchen scares and the camera-on-the-oscillating fan gimmick does provide a couple nice effects.They left enough story open in order to continue the saga if they wish (and they will).I remember being frightened by the original and then intrigued by the simple genius of the filmmakers.

Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 1]","""Paranormal Activity 3"" uses the same conceit of the two earlier installments but is actually a prequel, establishing the creepy background for Katie (Katie Featherson) and her sister Kristi (Sprague Grayden). Through the power of found tapes, the film takes us back before the first two installments to flesh out what the ""Paranormal Activity"" series established - the girls were not random victims of a haunting.Oren Peli's ghost series is known for having certain elements that few other films can replicate: threatening children; subtle but creepy special effects, and using everyday footage to tell a ghost story.  All those elements are in full force in ""Paranormal Activity 3."" The two girls serve as perpetual foils for Kristi's imaginary friend, Toby.  Toby, it seems, is not as imaginary as the girls' mother Julie (Lauren Bittner, adding some skin to the franchise) might hope.  Hapless boyfriend and wedding videographer Dennis (Christopher Nicholas Smith) is particularly interested in what goes on at their house when a specter appears on a homemade film. Dennis' curiosity piqued, he recruits techie friend Randy (Dustin Ingram) to get to the bottom of what's going on by setting up cameras around the house, including one mounted on an oscillating fan.What ensues is a series of freak-outs that range from noises in a closet to something as mundane as a kid wearing a sheet.  The scariest moments involve outsiders like Randy and babysitter Lisa (Johanna Brady). Their reactions add some spice to an otherwise faithful retread of the original film, with Dennis taking the role of the hapless investigator and Julie the unbelieving skeptic. But it's really the girls that make the film so unsettling by talking to the invisible Toby, walking around the house at night, and standing still for hours at a time.""Paranormal Activity 3"" makes clever use of sound, or lack thereof, so that you will be leaning into the screen when the scares arrive.  This installment does resort to more ""jump"" scares than the previous two, but that's forgivable given that there are many genuinely frightening moments.  The oscillating camera trick manages to create more dread in a single scene than some horror movie franchises.If ""Paranormal Activity 3"" has a weakness it's the ending, less ghost story and more ""Rosemary's Baby.""

Oleson,"[0, 0]","I'm not sure if it's just because this series is getting tired or if maybe I was, but this edition didn't quite have the fear factor of the others.  At the same time, the idea while no longer unique has a certain dread about it that most of us can appreciate.  This is a prequel to the first two and goes back to 1988 when sisters Katie (PA 1) and Kristi (PA 2) were young girls and get their first haunted house experience...thanks a lot grandma!We get to see the events as their father-like boyfriend of mom and  photographer (Christopher Nicholas Smith) uses a couple cameras to video tape (yes VHS) events inside their house.  Dennis (Smith) is a professional in that his primary source of income is shooting wedding videos.  I don't think mom works so I'm not sure how they can afford such a nice house, but we also don't know where the real father is either.  I digress.PA 3 does have an innovative idea that really works.  Dennis mounts the camera on a rotating fan so that he can pan across the kitchen into the dining room and foyer.  This trick amps up the suspense and anticipation as we get to see what may or may not be coming.

Blaire Witch set the standards and a few other competent films have followed. Paranormal the First created a new precedent of special effects, seemingly before your eyes. Whether its all post-edit computer effects can be argued, but the result is effective.The second installment seemed to rest on the hype alone and had no real follow-up from the first. I am not even sure if was the same house. Which dulls any later attempts because now the idea of what became Paranormal is not just random acts of ghostly stuff. One can get the same benefit from Discover Channel's ""A Haunting"".With the third installment, again, its another family. No history of anything is recalled or brought into play. This film has a larger family. A husband, wife and two daughters. Why these hauntings occur does not ever surface. The husband notices things and so this justifies him placing cameras in the house. The mother refuses to view any of it, so naturally she never spots anything. Throughout, her daughter talks to a Toby, which she believes is her daughters imaginary friend and says its a passing phase for a few weeks. We learn that Toby is the evil spirit behind all the happenings.Thats really the essence of the story. From that we are treated with some scary and creepy moments of ghostly raptures, telekinetic activity, other such nuisances. I believe some back story would create a deeper and emotional scare rather than just shock scares. My problem with handheld camera movies is that, almost under no circumstances to do these people relieve themselves of the camera for something as dire as surviving or protecting their loved ones. Towards the end, we see the mother in a situation, and the husband, while asking if she is ok, continues to hold the camera. We know she is in trouble, and he is not exactly in a safe spot either. I say ""drop the camera!!"" I know it's all for effect, but the realism is removed in those instances. This is not the only film that does that, but I still get pulled out of the movie or lose sympathy for the people.Paranormal still has scary and creepy moments that will sure make it a worthwhile viewing.

1402397,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B004EPZ02A,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Paranormal Activity 3 (Henry Joost and Ariel Schulamn, 2011)I was a big, big fan of the first two Paranormal Activity movies. The first one dropped like a bomb from out of nowhere&#8212;it was one of the first found-footage films since The Blair Witch Project that actually looked like a found footage movie (probably because of Oren Peli's lack of budget). The second was slicker, but it went places, emotionally, that the first hadn't dared to go, and it succeeded in doing something that no movie has done to me since Candyman twenty years previous&#8212;it scared the pants off me in a crowded theater. So of course I had high hopes for the third installment in the franchise, and the first trailer that came out seemed pretty nifty. How much did I like Joost and Schulman (Catfish)'s first entry in the series? I'll put it this way: I've had Paranormal Activity 4 on my Netflix Instant queue since the day it appeared there...but I haven't watched it yet.NOTE: the plot synopsis necessarily contains spoilers for the first film in the series. Proceed with caution if necessary.Set in 1988, Paranormal Activity 3 purports to tell the story of how poor Katie (Up All Night's Chloe Csengery) and her little sister Kristi (Wiener Dog Nationals' Jessica Tyler Brown)  first met up with the demon that has haunted Katie throughout the series. The movie focuses more on Katie and Kristi's mother, Julie (Bride Wars' Lauren Bittner) and her boyfriend Dennis (Little Children's Christopher Nicholas Smith), as well as Dennis' friend Randy (Sky High's Dustin Ingram), a videographer Dennis brings in to help document the weird things going on in the house when they start getting out of hand. We first learn something is amiss when Kristi started talking to an imaginary friend she has named Toby. While that doesn't seem out of the ordinary at the beginning, Dennis starts to realize that Toby may not be entirely imaginary after an earthquake&#8212;he captured a few frames of video that night where the settling dust outlined a human-shaped figure, otherwise invisible. It's at this point he calls Randy in, and the movie begins to look like PA2, with cameras everywhere in the house. It would be a spoiler to say whether or not that mystery is ever revealed in this film (but as I mentioned in the first paragraph, there is a PA4, and a &#8220;related&#8221; movie, Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones, came and went in January 2014 with almost no fanfare).The main thing about PA3 that contrasts with the first two entries in the series is how forgettable it is; the setup is basically the same, the execution is the same, the only differences are the actors and directors.  And both come off here as pale imitations of the original. (There is also some debate over whether the final sequence of this film breaks canon. I originally thought so&#8212;actually, I think the phrase that went through my head as I was watching is &#8220;this makes no friggin' sense given the first two movies&#8221;&#8212;but I'm willing to be convinced otherwise by someone with some evidence.) Still, for all that, it's not a terrible movie; it has the weight of the two movies that came before it shoving it down in my estimation. Had it been a standalone Satanic Panic movie, I probably would have liked it more; it's not The House of the Devil, but then few things are. Still, I would have liked to see these directors&#8212;who have been noted widely for being so avant-garde in Catfish&#8212;to do something, anything, here that defied convention. **",2,Journey to the end of the fright.,1396742400,"04 6, 2014",2014,3538,"['Paranormal', 'Activity', '3', 'Henry', 'Joost', 'Ariel', 'Schulamn', '2011', 'was', 'big', 'big', 'fan', 'first', 'two', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'movies', 'first', 'one', 'dropped', 'bomb', 'nowhere', '8212', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'found-footage', 'films', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'actually', 'looked', 'found', 'footage', 'movie', 'probably', 'Oren', 'Peli', 'lack', 'budget', 'second', 'was', 'slicker', 'went', 'places', 'emotionally', 'first', 'had', ""n't"", 'dared', 'go', 'succeeded', 'doing', 'something', 'movie', 'done', 'Candyman', 'twenty', 'years', 'previous', '8212', 'scared', 'pants', 'crowded', 'theater', 'course', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'third', 'installment', 'franchise', 'first', 'trailer', 'came', 'out', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'nifty', 'How', 'much', 'did', 'Joost', 'Schulman', 'Catfish', 'first', 'entry', 'series', ""'ll"", 'put', 'way', ""'ve"", 'had', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '4', 'Netflix', 'Instant', 'queue', 'day', 'appeared', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'necessarily', 'spoilers', 'first', 'film', 'series', 'Proceed', 'caution', 'necessary.Set', '1988', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '3', 'purports', 'tell', 'story', 'how', 'poor', 'Katie', 'Night', 'Chloe', 'Csengery', 'little', 'sister', 'Kristi', 'Wiener', 'Dog', 'Nationals', 'Jessica', 'Tyler', 'Brown', 'first', 'met', 'up', 'demon', 'haunted', 'Katie', 'series', 'movie', 'more', 'Katie', 'Kristi', 'mother', 'Julie', 'Bride', 'Wars', 'Lauren', 'Bittner', 'boyfriend', 'Dennis', 'Little', 'Children', 'Christopher', 'Nicholas', 'Smith', 'as', 'well', 'Dennis', 'friend', 'Randy', 'Sky', 'High', 'Dustin', 'Ingram', 'videographer', 'Dennis', 'help', 'document', 'weird', 'things', 'going', 'house', 'when', 'start', 'getting', 'hand', 'first', 'learn', 'something', 'amiss', 'when', 'Kristi', 'started', 'talking', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'named', 'Toby', ""n't"", 'seem', 'out', 'ordinary', 'beginning', 'Dennis', 'realize', 'Toby', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'entirely', 'imaginary', 'earthquake', '8212', 'captured', 'few', 'frames', 'video', 'night', 'where', 'settling', 'dust', 'outlined', 'human-shaped', 'figure', 'otherwise', 'invisible', 'point', 'Randy', 'movie', 'look', 'PA2', 'cameras', 'everywhere', 'house', 'would', 'be', 'spoiler', 'say', 'not', 'mystery', 'ever', 'revealed', 'film', 'mentioned', 'first', 'paragraph', 'PA4', '8220', 'related', '8221', 'movie', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'Marked', 'Ones', 'came', 'went', 'January', '2014', 'almost', 'fanfare', 'main', 'thing', 'PA3', 'first', 'two', 'entries', 'series', 'how', 'forgettable', 'setup', 'basically', 'same', 'execution', 'same', 'only', 'differences', 'are', 'actors', 'directors', 'come', 'off', 'here', 'pale', 'imitations', 'original', 'also', 'debate', 'final', 'sequence', 'film', 'canon', 'originally', 'thought', 'so', '8212', 'actually', 'think', 'phrase', 'went', 'head', 'was', 'watching', '8220', 'friggin', 'sense', 'given', 'first', 'two', 'movies', '8221', '8212', ""'m"", 'willing', 'be', 'convinced', 'otherwise', 'someone', 'evidence', 'Still', 'not', 'terrible', 'movie', 'weight', 'two', 'movies', 'came', 'shoving', 'down', 'estimation', 'Had', 'been', 'standalone', 'Satanic', 'Panic', 'movie', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'not', 'House', 'Devil', 'then', 'few', 'things', 'are', 'Still', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'directors', '8212', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'noted', 'widely', 'being', 'so', 'avant-garde', 'Catfish', '8212', 'do', 'something', 'anything', 'here', 'defied', 'convention', '**']",Paranormal Activity 3

1402404,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B004EPZ02A,Scott Schiefelbein,"[2, 2]","It must be said that the ""found footage"" sub-genre of horror movies requires the audience to suspend disbelief a bit.  The idea is clever - you're watching something that allegedly really happened, which gives the movie a bit of documentary-style credibility.  But you have to accept that at some point in the movie, you're going to shout, ""put down the darn camera!""  It's surprising that the ""Scream"" franchise hasn't mocked this trope yet.Either you can get past this, or you can't.  If you can, the ""Paranormal Activity"" series should be on your must-see list.  The first two movies tell the present-day stories of Kristi and Katie, two sisters whose pleasantly suburban lifestyles are ripped asunder by a sinister spectral force.  In ""Paranormal Activity 3,"" we return to 1988, where the sisters first meet the poltergeist who will terrify them and their families a few years down the road.The movie sets the stage by showing grown-up Kristy and Katie rediscovering old videotapes from when they were children - a gift from recently departed Grandma.  These tapes are later stolen in a scene all too familiar with fans of the first two films.  The movie then switches to the videotapes.Young Katie and Kristi are enjoying Katie's birthday party, and we also meet their mom Julie and her boyfriend Dennis.  (Oddly, there's never any mention of the girls' biological father - where did he go . . . hmmm.)  Dennis, conveniently for the movie's conceit, is a videographer, so naturally his response to every development is his life is to tape it.  During the birthday video, we learn that Kristi has a close relationship with an imaginary friend, Toby.Toby, as you might guess, turns out to be more than imaginary, and he quickly proves to be one scary, demanding guy.  To avoid spoilers, that's it for the plot summary.Directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman know how to make a found-footage movie.  Tension builds nicely as we strain to watch a seemingly innocuous scene - are the bedsheets moving?  How about the lamp?  Perhaps the creepiest scenes (before the final 15 minutes, which are terrifying) come with their use of a video camera set up on an oscillating fan base so the camera slowly pans from one part of the house to another - the directors' clever use of the ""that freaking thing wasn't there a few seconds ago"" trick will have you looking over your own shoulder the next time you're all alone in the house and hear an unexplained noise.For a third installment in a horror series, ""Paranormal Activity 3"" exceeds all expectations.  A spooky film that builds to a truly frightening third act, ""3"" succeeds in deepening the story created by the first two installments without wearing out our interest - the filmmakers know that we're here to get scared, not to get a PhD-level understanding of Toby . . . and scare you they do.

1402406,A2A1HXFSAPA9A5,B004EPZ02A,S. Der,"[5, 7]","I saw this one on the release date at the theaters. I really loved Paranormal Activity 3. The story line pieced the other two movies lines all together. You can actually start watching this movie first before watching the other 2 movies and it does make sense. The 3rd movie is where it all started. Then, the 2nd movie is the middle story. But, the very end of the 2nd movie, shows you what happens after the 1st movie. Then, the 1st movie is actually follows the 2nd movie. Confused? Well, I wasn't because I pieced it all together in my mind. And, if you like to do that too, then you would love these movies.The 3rd movie does give you a small preview of what has happened in the other movies and starts working its way backwards in time. Then, it starts showing you how it all started. I thought they didn't really need this part and they should have just started the movie from how it all started. But, it doesn't take anything away, so I let it slide.Usually, when I watch prequel movies, they are done pretty badly and the story line usually doesn't fit in so well. But, in this movie, I loved how it all make sense. Now, what did I see.Spoiler Alert!!!!!!!I like finding out why and how it all started with Katie and Kristi. In this movie, you find out that Kristi, the younger sister has a friend name Toby. Toby turns out to be the demon that is hunting the house. Later on we find out more about Toby origins and why he is there.It looks to me like there are a bunch of women that are in this cult. This cult practices summoning demons. (I'm just not sure why they do that. But, once the demons are summoned they will seek to marry girls in their family. The demons will try to do everything to convince the girls to marry them. Meaning they will scary and terrify them until they finally agree. Then, she will have to give up the first born male child to the demon. (This was a connection to PA2.)At the very end of the movie, the grand mother is who started it all, and she is the one that summoned Toby. Toby is now following the grand daughter, Kristi and trying to marry her. (Now, you have the whole back story. and can start watching PA 2. Then, when you finish watching PA 2, you will understand PA 1 better.)I really like how in this movie, they stop doing the whole human procession bit. Toby can really show off his real power and great performance. My favorite part of the movie was when Katie is chasing Kristi and she then runs into what seems like a wall. The wall of course is Toby. Then, Toby is invisible and you can't see what he is doing, but you know that he is there. You feel like something is going to happen and it does! I won't spoil it for you and won't tell you what happens. I was pretty surprised to that.This movie made a change to what I saw in the commercial. In the commercial, you see the two little girls play bloody marry and at the end of the scene, you see a dark female figure. Well, in the movie, they took that part out and replaced it with something way better! They still play bloody marry, but it has been changed for the better. I won't spoil that part for you and you should just watch it.I find myself laughing sometimes in this movie, and it's not because the movie is a comedy. I started to laugh because I have a good assumption to what's going to see. But, during that time before it actually happens, I started to laugh. For example, at the end of the movie, you see little Katie turn around by the staircase. The guy calls Katie and she doesn't respond. He slowly starts moving towards Katie and still calling her. She still doesn't make any reaction or movement. I start laughing. I know something bad/scary about to happen. I'm thinking, don't do it. Don't do it! Don't go to her!!! But, I'm seeing it and its happening. Then, the bad does happen. This of course, isn't really meant to be joke.

It was a decent attempt and it wasn't that the director was lacking anything. Its just that I already seen it before. I get tired of a original idea for a film doing really well then there's numerous more made. I seen it before now try doing something else original to scare us. If you trully loved the original you will like this third instillation. This is supposed to be the origins movie, to explain how Paranormal Activity began. I don't want to ruin it for anyone but this movie reminded me and my family as another Blair Witch project. Watch the movie and wait till the end to understand what I mean. I would trully wait for this movie to come out on DVD and wouldn't waste your money at the theaters. If your like me and are tired of all the SAWS and Final Destinations that just keep being made. This will probably be no different from those franchises. How much originality can you come up with when you hit part 9. In a few years you'll see Paranormal Activity In Space or something like that.

1402413,A171FU7AC9YYMS,B004EPZ02A,"Steve Forsyth ""sforsythnoe""","[3, 4]","The original Paranormal Activity was one of those wonderful stories of a no-budget project striking it rich.  The inevitable sequel managed to avoid the common ""bigger is better"" mentality of most sequels to actually rival, if not surpass its original.  Expectations, then, were understandably high for this third entry in the franchise.  Unfortunately, the ""rule of three"" rears its ugly head this time out.  Paranormal Activity 3, while containing some very inventive moments, ultimately represents the typical ""bare-bones story to hang a bunch of creepy shots on"" mindset.If you don't know by now, this entry attempts to give us some backstory on the sisters of the first two films.  Thus, from its inception, the movie has an uphill battle to fight.  If George Lucas has taught us anything, it's that your backstory should always remain just that ... backstory...  not your main plot.A brief opening segment shows us the sisters just before the tragic events unfold, as they discover a box of VHS tapes from their childhood.  From here we dive into 1988 and a young Katie and Kristi with their mother Julie, and Dennis, her new live-in boyfriend.  The film wastes no time jumping into the ""bumps in the night"" sequences that induce Dennis to setup the requisite cameras around the house... his being a wedding videographer serving as the explanation for why he has access to so much equipment, which would have been VERY expensive back in its day.  The movie does not deviate from the formula of alternating nighttime segments with the follow up reactions to watching the footage and the inevitable climax of ""activity"" and tragedy.  By now, you know most of what's going to happen, and the film largely relies more on jump scares (many of them cheap fake-outs) than the genuine creepiness of its predecessors (save for one masterful moment involving a babysitter).  The one real innovation this time out is a camera placed on the base of an oscillating fan which slowly pans between the kitchen and living room.  It's pretty incredible how suspenseful a slow, repetitive pan can be, and the two or three sequences that play off this concept are the only real highlights of the film.From the get go, the film presents its weakest element, and that is lack of sympathetic characters.  The children, while cute, are underdeveloped as characters and not particularly convincing in their acting. The adults, meanwhile, are easily the most cardboard and generic characters to come out of this series.  The few characters from outside the family are not even remotely sketched out enough to generate any interest either.  In the previous films, the segments between the nighttime scenes were slowly giving us some insight into the families and friends ... filling in a little detail without losing sight of the main story.  In this film, we learn nothing about the girls' mother ... why is she single?  Where is the father?  Who is this boyfriend and how has he come into the picture?  We certainly don't expect to focus on any of these things - but some sense that they have an existence outside the elements of the film would go a long way toward humanizing them.The bulk of the film plays out as expected, and isn't too bad, even if it is growing all too familiar.  However, a late in the film relocation of the action seems to completely destroy any momentum, and the finale suffers for it.In the end, we haven't really learned much about the background of the girls that we didn't already know from the snippets of conversation in the previous two films.  Sadly, one of the chief mysteries, that of the half-burned polaroid from the first film, remains unresolved ... leaving room, I suppose, for another prequel.Now, if I may vent for a moment... the problem with trotting a one-trick pony out too many times is that the flaws start to become harder to put out of your mind.  Chief among them being that which is the bane of any mock-umentary, and that is the increasing unlikelihood that characters facing an immediate threat to their lives would continue to film their demise from a shoulder mounted camera.  In key moments, rather than being terrified at how Dennis might escape the menace that is barreling down on him and the young girls, I found myself wondering why he doesn't drop the camera and bolt out the door.Add to this the illogic that we have a man who hears noises coming from a kids bedroom storage closet, and then promptly sets up a camera that DOES NOT INCLUDE THE CLOSET IN THE SHOT!  Rather, he is focused on the girls' beds.  Even after Kristi has a conversation with ""something"" in the closet which is just off camera, still Dennis does not think to re-orient the camera to the closet door.Likewise mind-boggling is setting up a camera in the living room, where nothing has been happening at all!  Again, we know these are cheats for the sake of the audience, and when the idea was fresh in the first two movies, we simply overlooked them - but when the story becomes so threadbare as to no longer engage our minds, we can't help but go there.And the film goes beyond that - it is littered with scenes that would send any real life person running out the door, yet somehow we are asked to accept that after a girl is lifted in the air by her hair in her bedroom, that very night she will still sleep in the same room.  When Julie is fed up with Dennis' cameras, she shouts at him ... ""this ends TOMORROW!""  I laughed to myself ... ""Tomorrow!?""  Wouldn't a seriously pissed off person say it ends NOW!?  But of course, that would mean the movie is over!  Even after relocating to her mother's house, Dennis still sets up the camera in their bedroom ... ""How much longer are you going to videotape?"" Julie asks. Dennis answers, in a serious example of how little the producers cared about scripting, ""Until this is all over, I guess.""  Bam, done ... there's a camera set up in their bedroom, accept it!The official trailer was apparently packed with scenes that do not exist in the final film, neither the theatrical nor the director's cut.  I suppose this was a ploy to keep audiences from being able to predict the scares of the movie - but I couldn't help but feel that the movie I had EXPECTED to see from the trailer might have been a much better movie than what we actually got.  In short, while I was entertained by it, after the fact I felt the film wasted its potential to really delve into the girls and their story, and instead delivered us the inevitable formula approach - ""just turn out the lights and make things suddenly move and get loud.""  At this point, the series has really tapped out its potential, and its time to move on to other things.  But, when a studio smells cash, well, you know what happens...",3,"Despite a handful of innovative moments, the lack of sympathetic characters really drags the film down",1329264000,"02 15,

They're very low-key, minimalist supernatural stories that manage to use their limitations to bring about some effective chills.I've watched hours after hours of full-blown, stomach-churning gorefests that couldn't pull off one of the genuine eerie chills I got from watching the security cameras in the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY films.They're creating a reality where something sinister is growing off-camera, in our closets, down the hall--places we know very well.  A light turning on and off on the other side of the house fills us with dread since we know no one is there.  And, for the third time, I was pulled into this experience.The problem I had this time was that it wasn't entirely clear just what was down the hall.  Although that was intentional for the purposes of the story (it is resolved, at least partially, by the end), I didn't get the same feeling of knowing that a demon was loose in these people's lives.  The trailer showed the little girls summoning a ghost via the ""Bloody Mary"" campfire tale of repeating her name in a dark room three times.  This scene doesn't appear in the film.  What does appear in the film is one of the little girls chanting it with an adult--but since there's clearly something already in the house, it doesn't really fit.But there are still some very cool scenes, especially involving a rotating camera that slowly scans back and forth.  My favorite involved the babysitter.There will be a 4th entry and the trailer was recently released picking up the story with Katie and Hunter now haunting a pretty young neighbor.  We're back in the present for the next one and I'm sure I'll see it, interested to see where they go with this.I'd like to see one where someone reacts to all of this paranormal activity going on in all of these home movies!",3,The least scariest of the three...but not without cool scenes....,1344556800,"08 10, 2012",2012,1877,"['be', 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'reaction', 'PARANORMAL', 'ACTIVITY', 'films', ""'re"", 'very', 'low-key', 'minimalist', 'supernatural', 'stories', 'manage', 'use', 'limitations', 'bring', 'about', 'effective', 'chills.I', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'hours', 'hours', 'full-blown', 'stomach-churning', 'gorefests', 'could', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'one', 'genuine', 'eerie', 'chills', 'got', 'watching', 'security', 'cameras', 'PARANORMAL', 'ACTIVITY', 'films.They', ""'re"", 'creating', 'reality', 'where', 'something', 'sinister', 'growing', 'off-camera', 'closets', 'down', 'hall', 'know', 'very', 'well', 'light', 'turning', 'other', 'side', 'house', 'dread', 'know', 'one', 'there', 'third', 'time', 'was', 'pulled', 'experience.The', 'problem', 'had', 'time', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'clear', 'just', 'what', 'was', 'down', 'hall', 'was', 'intentional', 'purposes', 'story', 'resolved', 'least', 'partially', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'same', 'feeling', 'knowing', 'demon', 'was', 'loose', 'people', 'lives', 'trailer', 'showed', 'little', 'girls', 'summoning', 'ghost', 'Bloody', 'Mary', 'campfire', 'tale', 'repeating', 'name', 'dark', 'room', 'three', 'times', 'scene', ""n't"", 'appear', 'film', 'What', 'appear', 'film', 'one', 'little', 'girls', 'chanting', 'adult', 'clearly', 'something', 'already', 'house', ""n't"", 'really', 'fit.But', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'cool', 'scenes', 'especially', 'involving', 'rotating', 'camera', 'slowly', 'back', 'forth', 'favorite', 'involved', 'babysitter.There', 'will', 'be', '4th', 'entry', 'trailer', 'was', 'recently', 'released', 'picking', 'up', 'story', 'Katie', 'Hunter', 'now', 'haunting', 'pretty', 'young', 'neighbor', ""'re"", 'back', 'present', 'next', 'one', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'see', 'interested', 'see', 'where', 'go', 'this.I', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'one', 'where', 'someone', 'paranormal', 'activity', 'going', 'home', 'movies']",Paranormal Activity 3

The stories are too slow to build with long scenes of nothing and then the scare is minimal. This movie is the spoiler for the series as we find out from the subtitle ""It runs in the family."" We do get an explanation. This is a prequel filmed in high quality DVD using a VHS camera. The acting was better in this one. Lauren Bittner was convincing as Julie. In one scene she puts on a mask and scares the guys. She is so happy she got one over on them, she jumps around with bubbly joy. Also extremely realistic is young Kristi (Jessica Tyler Brown) who convinces me she has an imaginary friend named Captain Howdy, er ah Toby.  Likewise child actor Chloe Csengery did an excellent job as Katie as she goes screaming across the room.There is a sex scene that is comical. Dennis (Christopher Nicholas Smith) starts out mouthing ""wack-a-da, wack-a-da"" porno music and as a romantic sort stampedes right to Julie's chest. There are some strange events going on in the house, so it gets wired for VHS tapes. Now as I recall the longest VHS tape setting was 6 hours (some were 8 hours) which means they would of had to been changed out frequently and viewed for paranormal activity with some scenes lasting for a second. With multiple cameras going 24/7...well you get the idea of how tedious and impracticable this becomes. In one scene the stationary VHS camera is looking at the entire girl's bedroom and then the next second it is focusing on Kristi's bed. While they used the amateur camera for a realistic effect, they didn't stay true to it, which made for a better movie. Maybe one day they will discover how real movies are made.What is not credible is the wife not believing what is going on and refusing to look at the evidence on film. They had to do this so they could keep the constant build up. Dennis filming everything with the camera at grandma's house didn't make much sense. At some point if you are being chased, you stop filming and run. If you are hiding and need to be quiet, you don't keep the camera on. The chase scene is hard to justify filming in all of these types of movies. I felt a little short changed on the ending.Like the other movies, it starts out slowly, but it doesn't sputter and grind its wheels like they did. This is my favorite of the three.F-bomb, no nudity, comical foreplay scene. Was that a 1993 Free Willy stuffed whale in this 1988 movie?

1402422,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B004EPZ02A,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","Paranormal Activity started the phenomenon of films that are shot on camcorder. At the time, it was considered to be revolutionary, but at this point it's getting a little old. How many of these camcorder films have actually been successful? ...and don't you get just the slightest bit nauseated by the constant movement of the camera? I guess that's for you to decide, back to the film. In the third installment of Paranormal Activity, we learn what happened to Katie and her sister when they were little. To be honest with you, I was pretty into this film until the last twenty minutes or so. Without spoiling it for ya, lets just say the story takes a dramatic turn away from the storyline. The result of this is that the overall story isn't as creepy and really doesn't make as much sense as it should. Paranormal Activity was never that scary to begin with, the film plays on the audience by having things suddenly jump out at them, but the story itself has gotten far less creepier as the series has gone on. Part 3 and 4 do have different writer/directors and that may be part of the problem. The first one freaked me out, the second one was a little slow, but also did the trick, and this one really didn't scare me. They relied much more on making the audience jump than they did on scaring them with the actual story. Number three didn't stick with me for days afterward, the way one and two did. As for the cast, they were all newcomers and the little girls were absolutely terrific! This series has a way of finding newcomers who seem like they've been acting for decades. Paranormal Activity 3 is good for a few cheap jumps and laughs, but the ending was really disappointing, leading me to think less of this film than I do of the other two.",3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,1755,"['Paranormal', 'Activity', 'started', 'phenomenon', 'films', 'are', 'shot', 'camcorder', 'time', 'was', 'considered', 'be', 'revolutionary', 'point', 'getting', 'little', 'old', 'How', 'many', 'camcorder', 'films', 'have', 'actually', 'been', 'successful', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'just', 'slightest', 'bit', 'nauseated', 'constant', 'movement', 'camera', 'guess', 'decide', 'back', 'film', 'third', 'installment', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'learn', 'what', 'happened', 'Katie', 'sister', 'when', 'were', 'little', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'pretty', 'film', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', 'spoiling', 'ya', 'just', 'say', 'story', 'dramatic', 'turn', 'away', 'storyline', 'result', 'overall', 'story', ""n't"", 'creepy', 'really', ""n't"", 'make', 'as', 'much', 'sense', 'should', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'was', 'never', 'scary', 'begin', 'film', 'audience', 'having', 'things', 'suddenly', 'jump', 'out', 'story', 'gotten', 'far', 'less', 'creepier', 'series', 'gone', 'Part', '3', '4', 'do', 'have', 'different', 'writer/directors', 'may', 'be', 'part', 'problem', 'first', 'one', 'freaked', 'out', 'second', 'one', 'was', 'little', 'slow', 'also', 'did', 'trick', 'one', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'scare', 'relied', 'much', 'more', 'making', 'audience', 'jump', 'did', 'scaring', 'actual', 'story', 'Number', 'three', 'did', ""n't"", 'stick', 'days', 'afterward', 'way', 'one', 'two', 'did', 'cast', 'were', 'newcomers', 'little', 'girls', 'were', 'absolutely', 'terrific', 'series', 'way', 'finding', 'newcomers', 'who', 'seem', ""'ve"", 'been', 'acting', 'decades', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '3', 'good', 'few', 'cheap', 'jumps', 'laughs', 'ending', 'was', 'really', 'disappointing', 'leading', 'think', 'less', 'film', 'do', 'other', 'two']",Paranormal Activity 3

1402424,A1L7PH0CS9BHP6,B004EPZ02A,Tom,"[5, 11]","I went to see this movie in the theater and really was disappointed in it.  I think the main reason that I was so disappointed was the fact that over 80 percent of the trailer was not in the movie and the scenes that were cut were really the reasons why I wanted to go see the movie.  I thought, initially, that there were going to be a lot more questions answered like the fire and what happened to their mother, but this was just a subpar movie with nothing really answered.  There are a few scares and the ending of the movie is pretty messed up but otherwise this movie kind of plays like the others and leaves you with more questions than answers which I thought we were going to get.  Now I fear we may get yet another prequel to the series with PA 4 when really I think most fans just want to find out what went wrong with Katie and her sister, the fire, etc and move on.  I'm curious as to what happened to the baby at the end of PA 2 (will this ever be answered?) and there are some other questions that I have but I don't want to waste time on that.  The movie just wasn't that good due to the trailer scenes being cut and you know something is wrong when, and I'm not joking, when the movie was over people in the audience said, ""What?  That's it?!""  I think it was kind of a bad judgement call from the producers and directors to cut so much of the trailer out of the movie as this is the reason why people come to the movies based off what they see in the trailer.  In the future maybe you should release a plot synoposis and no trailer that way you give people no expectations of the movie.  Oh and to anyone who likes to go to scary movies to jump and yell and act stupid please stay away.  I actually had people in the theater I was in jumping at everything and screaming at everything and I swear there was one guy that was so scared he was ready to walk out.  Really?!!  Grow up and stop ruining movies for everyone else.  That's not really anything about the movie just people in the theater in general and I thought I'd put that out there.  Getting back to the movie though, it was just ok for me.  I think if the producers and director would have not shown too much in a trailer or a finished trailer then this movie would have been good.  I just think most people were a little disappointed that they didn't get to see the fire, the mother dragged down the hall and slammed on the bed, the little girl throwing water at the entity, the girl jumping down the stairs, the entity in the bathroom with the girls as they play bloody mary, the dad play the knocking game at the closet and the medium or preacher or whatever he is getting his head slammed off the table and pulled backward, etc.  I think if they wouldn't have shown these parts in the trailer then they wouldn't have gotten people's hopes up and ultimatly squashed them.  Next time show us a finished trailer so we know what we're getting.  Hopefully PA 4 will be better.

1402429,A24J6PQ0FN55A6,B004EPZ02A,WestGrl,"[0, 0]","Out of the 3 Paranormal movies, this was my least favorite. Not to say it wasn't good. The movie dates back to the 80's and follows the childhood of the women from Paranormal 2. They have to use VHS tapes & come up with creative ways to capture video like attaching a camera to a fan that rotates back & forth. The fan actually gave the movie some suspense as it panned slowly back & forth you become anxious waiting to see if there will suddenly be something there that wasn't before.The storyline itself was interesting. But this was much less scary than the previous 2. There is an explanation at the end about how and why everything happened which also leads to an explanation for the 2nd movie. I also noticed many scenes from the trailer were not present in the movie which was a little disappointing. Overall, it was a decent suspense movie but based on the 1st two, and the trailer, I think it could have been better. Anyone that is a fan of the Paranormal movies will find it worth watching.",3,Least favorite but still good,1333843200,"04 8, 2012",2012,1000,"['3', 'Paranormal', 'movies', 'was', 'least', 'favorite', 'Not', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'movie', 'back', '80', 'childhood', 'women', 'Paranormal', '2', 'have', 'use', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'come', 'up', 'creative', 'ways', 'capture', 'video', 'attaching', 'camera', 'fan', 'back', 'forth', 'fan', 'actually', 'gave', 'movie', 'suspense', 'panned', 'slowly', 'back', 'forth', 'become', 'anxious', 'waiting', 'see', 'will', 'suddenly', 'be', 'something', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'before.The', 'storyline', 'was', 'interesting', 'was', 'much', 'less', 'scary', 'previous', '2', 'explanation', 'end', 'how', 'why', 'everything', 'happened', 'also', 'explanation', '2nd', 'movie', 'also', 'noticed', 'many', 'scenes', 'trailer', 'were', 'not', 'present', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'disappointing', 'Overall', 'was', 'decent', 'suspense', 'movie', 'based', '1st', 'two', 'trailer', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Anyone', 'fan', 'Paranormal', 'movies', 'will', 'find', 'worth', 'watching']",Paranormal Activity 3

It was scary and kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through it!So I rushed out and got this on the very first day it was released and I eagerly watched it.  It was just as good on my TV as it was in the theaters.  I wasn't as scared cuz I knew what was going to happen, but I was excited to see that there was a ""Extended Version!""  I eagerly clicked on that and watched it with my girlfriend.  However from what I could see, there was only one thing that was different.  There's a scene where Dennis gets up in the middle of the night cuz he hears something and he grabs the camera.  He goes to the window and something rattles the window.  That's it.  Not really worth the extra money if you ask me.I only have one actual complaint about the movie itself.  They use modern catch phrases in a movie that was set in the 80's.  The phrases, ""That just happened!"" and ""Seriously!?!"" Those phrases didn't exist back then, so they shouldn't be in this movie!Ever since the first Paranormal Activity movie came out I was waiting for them to put a commentary on one of these movies so I could hear more about this movie series and how the movies were made, but I have yet to get a Paranormal Activity with a commentary, or some interviews, or SOMETHING other than just the movie itself.Sure there was a few extra ""scares"" where Dennis scares his wife in the style of MTV's Jackass, and a commercial that Dennis made for his little business of filming weddings.  But that's it, that's all that's on this Blu Ray.So if all you're really looking for is the movie itself, then you'll be very happy with this movie, but if you wanted some extra features on this disc, you're gonna be disappointed.",3,"Good Movie, Lame Special Features",1327363200,"01 24, 2012",2012,1736,"['Okay', 'LOVED', 'movie', 'theater', 'was', 'scary', 'kept', 'edge', 'seat', 'way', 'So', 'rushed', 'out', 'got', 'very', 'first', 'day', 'was', 'released', 'eagerly', 'watched', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'TV', 'was', 'theaters', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'scared', 'cuz', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'was', 'Extended', 'Version', 'eagerly', 'clicked', 'watched', 'girlfriend', 'However', 'what', 'could', 'see', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'was', 'different', 'scene', 'where', 'Dennis', 'up', 'middle', 'night', 'cuz', 'something', 'grabs', 'camera', 'window', 'something', 'window', 'Not', 'really', 'extra', 'money', 'ask', 'only', 'have', 'one', 'actual', 'complaint', 'movie', 'use', 'modern', 'catch', 'phrases', 'movie', 'was', 'set', '80', 'phrases', 'just', 'happened', 'Seriously', 'phrases', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', 'back', 'then', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'movie', 'Ever', 'first', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'waiting', 'put', 'commentary', 'one', 'movies', 'so', 'could', 'hear', 'more', 'movie', 'series', 'how', 'movies', 'were', 'made', 'have', 'yet', 'get', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'commentary', 'interviews', 'other', 'just', 'movie', 'itself.Sure', 'was', 'few', 'extra', 'scares', 'where', 'Dennis', 'wife', 'style', 'MTV', 'Jackass', 'commercial', 'Dennis', 'made', 'little', 'business', 'filming', 'weddings', 'Blu', 'Ray.So', ""'re"", 'really', 'looking', 'movie', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'very', 'happy', 'movie', 'wanted', 'extra', 'features', 'disc', ""'re"", 'gon', 'be', 'disappointed']",Paranormal Activity 3
